A CALL FROM Death to Life, AND Out of the Dark wayes and Worships of the World where the Seed is held in Bondage under the Merchants of Babylon, Written by Marmaduke Stephenson; Who (together with another dear Servant of the Lord called William Robinson) hath (since the Writing hereof) suffer∣ed Death, for bearing Witnesse to the same Truth, amongst the Professors of Bostons Jurisdiction in New England. With a True Copy of Two Letters, which they Writ to the Lords People a little before their Death. And also the True Copy of a Letter as it came to our hands, from a Friend in New England, which gives a brief Relation of the manner of their Martyrdom, with some of the Words which they exprest at the time of their suffering. John 16.2, 3. They shall put you out of their Assemblies, yea the time cometh, that who∣soever killeth you, will think that he doth God service; And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor Me, saith Christ. London, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Sign of the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate. 1660.
To the READER. But especially to you that are Professors (one in Doctrine and discipline with the professors in New England) do we write these things, that the wit∣nesse of God may arise in you, to judge between the Lords people called Qua∣kers, and your Brethren the Professors in New England, whether they have not forgotten God and his goodnesse towards them, and lost their first love which was stirring in them when they were little amongst the Families of the Earth, and whether they are not Children of the Whorish woman, that is called the Mother of Harlots, that hath sitten upon many waters, and deceived the Na∣tions with the wine of the Wrath of her fornications (which she offers in her gol∣den Cup) till the Earth is corrupted with violence, and she made drunk with the Blood of the Saints; Seeing they are so far Adulterated from God and Christ as that in their skirts is also found the Blood of the Saints & Martyrs of Je∣sus. Oh! how are they fallen that once seemed so tender in Conscience, as that they would rather leave their native Countrey, then practice things contrary to their Conscience, and who would have believed that they which once fled for fear of sufferings, would have caused others to suffer under their own hands, which are now become wicked hands; For they have taken two of Gods dear Servants, and hanged them on a Tree for no matter of Fact com∣mitted by them against any Law which is Iust,Here followeth a Copy of the Warrant to the Keeper of the Prison. but because they were found by their words and ac∣tions to be Quakers, and did (con∣trary to the sentence of banishment, which upon pain of death, the Court passed upon them, You are by vertue hereof, forthwith re∣quired to discharge the Prison of William Ro∣binson, Marmaduke Stevenson, Mary Dyer, and Nicholas Davis, who were found by the Court and Jury, by their own Confessions, Words, and Actions, to be Quakers, and had sentence pronounced against them, to depart this Ju∣risdiction on pain of Death, and that if after the 14th. of this Instant September, they or any of them be found within this Jurisdiction, or any part thereof, at their peril. Dated at Boston, the 12th. of September, 59 by Edward Rawson Secretary. return into their Iurisdiction as they were re∣quired of God to bear witnesse unto the Truth, in which there is po∣wer to set free, and for the Testi∣mony thereof, and that they might hold forth the good will of God in love to their Enemies, and that they
might be clear from the blood of all men, in giving them warning to repent, and walk in the Light of the Lord, their lives were not dear to them, they be∣ing nothing terrified by their adversaries, which to them is an evident token of perdition, but to the patient sufferers, of Salvation and that of God, with whom they have now a reward in the endlesse life; So that in them is fulfilled the words of Christ, he that will loose his life for my Sake, shall find it, but we do clearly see in the Light of the Lord, that he that seeks to save his own life will kill the Iust, and therefore we marvel not at what the professors in New England (that fled to save themselves) have done; Knowing that they which are born after the flesh, will persecute him that is born after the Spirit, but we do even pity to see such as do professe Scriptures have their eyes so shut, and their hearts so grosse, as to think they do God good service when they not onely cast out of their Synagogues, but out of their Coun∣trey, and do Imprison, Scourge, cut off Ears, and kill those that come to them in the Name and fear of the Lord, and do tremble at Gods Word, working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and here we do appeal to the wit∣nesse of God in you all Professors and People, whether the Professors in New England, have not acted quite contrary to God, in Imprisoning, Scourging, Banishing and Killing those that tremble at his Word, seeing God hath said to this man will I look, that is of a broken and contrite heart, and trem∣bleth at my Word, but to such the Professing Rulers in New England will not look, neither suffer them to have a being amongst them; And again we say, let the witnesse of God in you judge, whether they have not acted directly contrary to Christ in destroying mens lives, seeing he comes not destroy mens lives but to save mens lives, and whether they be not quite out of his Doctrine and Royal Law, which saith, what ever ye would that men should do unto you, do you even so unto them; And we do likewise appeale unto the witnesse of God in all sober people, whether the Pastours and Teachers of the People in New England (that stir up and encourage their flocks to persecute to death Gods Servants) be not become bruitish, and contrary to the Ministers of Christ and their flocks, contrary to the Primitive Christians, seeing the Ministers of Christ were gentle towards all men, and did not strive nor warr with Carnal Weapons, but did meekly instruct them that did oppose themselves, that with sound Doctrine they might convince their Adversaries, and they both loved and taught the believers that followed them, to love their Enemies, and not kill them, as they have killed those that they account their Enemies, for which they have no cause, unlsse it be for speaking the Truth; And again, whether these Teachers and Professors, and all that justifie their proceedings against the Lords Servants, be not of that Generation that killed the Prophets, and shame∣fully entreated those that were sent unto them, which called the Master of the house Beelzebub, and killed the Prince of Life; seeing they do the same things
to them of his Houshold. And Reader, That it may appear that these two (which the Professors of New England have taken, and by wicked hands put to death) were the Servants of Christ Iesus, and of the Houshold of God, we do here present to thy view these things following, which were writ by their own hands, and sent unto us not long before their death; Together with a Letter which was Writ from Ply∣mouth in New England by Peter Pearson, relating the manner of their death, with some of their words which they did expresse a little before their Martyrdom, all which we desire may be seriously weighed and laid to heart, that the witnesse of God may rise in Iudgement against the spirit of persecuti∣on in whomsoever it appears, to which spirit we exhort all men (that love their Soules) to beware of joyning; and so in love to all People we rest by Faith, chu∣sing rather to suffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a Season. John Whitehead. Marmaduke Storre. William Padley. Gregory Milner. Thomas Leemin. Written in York-shire, the 23d. day of the 3d. Month. 1660.
A Call from Death to Life, and out of the dark wayes and worships of the World, where the Seed is held in bondage under the Mer∣chants of Babylon. M. S. OH you my dear Neighbours and People in the Town of Shipton and Wighton and elsewhere, where this may come, who have been spending long your mony for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which doth not satisfie, as I have done; Oh come buy wine and milk without mony and without price, while it is held forth to you, least the day come that you be deprived of it; for long hath the Spirit of the Lord been striving with you (as it did with me) but you have resisted it time after time, be∣cause it testified against you when you went on in sin, and re∣proved in secret for the evil of your doings; therefore you do not regard it, but flies from it. So in bowels of tender love to you all do I speak, and in love and pity to your souls, prize the love of God, and his tender mercy and forbear∣ance to you, that he did not cut you off in the height of your iniquity, but hath spared you until this day, though you have long taken pleasure in sin, not regarding God that made you, yet hath his Spirit been striving with you many dayes & years, (as it did with me) and hath reproved you time after time, for the evil of your doings, but you regarded it not, though it often called upon you in love & meekness to depart from your iniquity, and that which you have been addicted to; it hath reproved and called you that have been addicted to drunken∣ness, lying and swearing to depart from these things, for they are evil, and it hath called upon you that are proud and co∣vetous to depart from them, and hath reproved you that have been wild and wanton, and given to sports and pleasures, to depart from them, and run on no longer in vanity, but you did not regard it, but took pleasure in sin. Oh consider dear Neighbors and People, what you have been doing ever since you came to years of maturity, and let the witnesse of God which is faithful and true in you all arise and answer, to which I speak, and it will let you see that you have provoked the Lord,
and vexed his righteous soul from day to day, and have pres∣sed him with your sins and iniquities, as a cart is pressed with sheaves, yet hath he born it with patience and hath suffered long, not willing that you should perish and dye in your sins but still he hath waited year after year upon you to be graci∣ous to you, but you have refused to return, and hearken to his Call and Counsel, but have run on in the broad way, as your Forefathers have done so do ye, and follow their Customs and Traditions which are vain, and will not profit you at all in the day of the Lord, when he comes to call you to an account how you have spent your time; so consider and lay it to heart, be∣fore the evil day come upon you, least the Spirit of the Lord cease striving with you, for verily the day is coming on apace that the Spirit of the Lord will cease striving with man, who puts the Day of God far from him, then it will be said, He that is Righteous let him be Righteous still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still. So dear Friends and People young and old, prize your time while you have it, and do not slight the Counsel of the Lord any longer, least the day of your visitation passe o∣ver your heads at unawares which cannot be called again, and as I said before, Spend your mony no longer for that which is not bread, in following Diviners of lyes, for they cause you to erre and go astray by their lyes and by their lightnesse, like sheep without a shepherd, for they are blind Watchmen which leads you out of the way, like troops of Robbers to devour you, Hos. ch. 6. v. 9 and makes merchandize of your souls, as they did upon me and thousands besides, which the Lord hath delivered as birds out of the Fowlers net; so being escaped from them, we see their deceit and subtle hypocrisie which long hath lodg∣ed in them, and therefore we cannot but declare against them, because they are seen to be such as devour widows houses for dishonest gain, and makes a prey upon you as they have done upon us, for they seek their gain from their quarter, and feeds themselves with the fat, and clothes themselves with the best of the wooll, as the false prophets did of old, which the true Prophets declared against; and with the same light that the true Prophets saw the false prophets of old, do we see these Priests in this generation, for their fruits makes them manifest what trees they are; For they sue men at the Law for Tithes, and take them by force, false Prophet like, and who cannot
put into their mouths for conscience sake, they prepare War against them, and with cruelty & oppression cause their goods to be taken from them to satisfie their wits and greedy desires; so they make themselves manifest to be of that generation, and to walk in their steps that the true Prophet spake of, who were greedy dumb doggs that can never have enough, as thou∣sands do witnesse at this day, and you may see it to be so with the Priests of this generation, for in Balaams steps they are walk∣ing, who loved the wages of unrighteousnesse, as they do in this generation, but they exceed him in cruelty; for though he loved it, he did not sue for it, but these Priests do in this generation, of which I am a witnesse, and thousands besides, who have suffered by them, to the spoiling of their goods and estates; Oh it is seen, it is seen in this our day that the filthy and abominable thing is committed in the land, as it was of old, the Prophets prophecy falsely, and the Priests bear Rule by their means, and the people love to have it so, but what will you do in the end thereof saith the Lord Almighty, for they have dawbed you up with untempered morter, and are Physicians of no value to you, for they have long been sowing pillows under your arm-holes, and have spoken smooth things to you, in healing that in you which is for destruction, and seeks to kill that which should live, that so they might rule o∣ver you as Kings in the Earth, and you to worship the Beast and his Image, who is making war with the Lamb, but the day of their downfal is at hand, and the Lamb shall have the victory, and Rule and Reign in his People for ever and ever, for now he is arisen in the Power of his Spirit, with great Do∣minion and Authority, to slay the wicked and cut down his enemies that resist him in his way; And they that will not have him to Reign over them, must fall before him who is our Head, who will render vengeance in flames of fire upon all his enemies. So dear People be awakened, and stand up to Judgement, and live no longer in carelesnesse and Carnal security, but own the Light of Christ to be your guide, for a measure of it is given to every one of you to profit withall, and it is nigh you in your hearts and in your mouths, the word of Faith which is able to save your Souls; so all to it take heed that by it you may be quickened and revived again out of your fallen estate wherein you lie by reason of your transgressions,
which have made a separation between you and your Maker, and verily I say unto you, except ye be regenerate and born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; So dear People young and Old, I speak to you all as one, consider how you have spent your time, and let a true search passe through you all, that you may see whom you have been serv∣ing all your time, for Servants you are to whom you do obey; So dear People be not deceived, for God will not be mocked, such as you sow, such you must reap from the hand of the Lord, and receive according to your deeds whether they be good or evil, who will give a reward to every man according as his works shall be, for he is a God that will not wink at wickedness nor let the transgressor go unpunished, to whom every knee shall bow and every tongue confesse him Lord, who created Heaven and Earth, whom we serve and Worship, who is our Lord and King, and Captain of our Salvation, Our Leader and Guider, and our Preserver night and day, our Mighty and Strong One, the Mighty God of Israel is his Name, the wonderful Counsellor and Prince of our Peace, whose pre∣sence is with us to the confounding of our Enemies that rise up in opposition against us, for he goes before us who is our Life to tread down our Enemies under his feet, who is terrible to the wicked, and all that forgets him must be turned into Hell, where the worm dies not, and the fire never goes out, the swearer and the lyar must go thither, that is their portion, the Drunkard and the Whore-monger must go thither, the proud and Covetous cannot escape the damnation of Hell, and all they that lives Dives like must pertake of Dives torment which is coming upon them, from which they cannot escape nor flie from, and all such must go into the lake with the Beast▪ and the false Prophet which have long born rule by their means in England, and in the Nations abroad, for they have devoured my Flock, and the Sheep of my pasture, saith the Lord Al∣mighty, who will be avenged on them, for the wounded they have not healed, nor comforted those who were sick, neither have they brought back again that which was driven away, but with force and cruelty have they ruled, but the Lord God is now come in his Mighty Power, to take their power from them, and deliver his People out of their hands, which have long been made a prey upon by them, and reward them double
for their doings; So you my dear neighbours, do not up∣hold them any longer in their sin, in satisfying their greedy desires, least you pertake with them of their plagues, and of the wrath of God that is coming upon them, from which they cannot escape, for they have grieved the Spirit of the Lord from day to day, to see what havock they have made in the Nation of England, by spoyling and causing spoyl to be made of Peo∣ples Goods and Estates, Oh! their sin is great and grievous to be born, and the cry of their oppression and their iniquity is entered into the eares of the Lord, that he is even grieved and sore vexed at them, for they have trampled upon his wit∣nesse in them, and have pressed him with their sin as a Cart is pressed with sheaves, so that he can bear no longer with them, because their iniquity doth abound. Oh! search the Scriptures and see if they do not go beyond and exceed the fale Prophets of old in deceit and subtile hypocrisie; Oh! they might even blush for shame, to consider what they have done and caused to be done, which will fall sad and heavy up∣on them when the Lord calls them to an account, and requires his flock at their hands; then shall they roar and weep bitterly, and wish they had never been Born, when Calamity & Anguish of Spirit overtakes them, which they will certainly meet withal, for the Lord hath spoken it who will perform his promise, that the Beast and the false Prophet shall go into the Lake toge∣ther, and for ever be tormented with the Devil and his angels, for thither must they go, and all that joyns with them must par∣take of their punishment; So dear Friends and People take heed what you do in joyning with such who leads you to de∣struction, for in the broad way they are walking themselves and leads you after them into the Pit of Perdition, where they must remain for ever, for they will not enter into the Kingdom themselves, nor suffer you if they can hinder; And will not the Lord arise for the Redemption of his Seed? Yea surely, he is arisen already, to shake the Nations that resist him, and hath given the Power to his Son, which shall rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, and they that will not bow to his Govern∣ment must be destroyed and broken to pieces, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it. So dear Friends, and People young and old, mind well what is written, and ponder it in your hearts, for in love to you all
do I speak, the Lord is my witnesse, that this is not written in any prejudice of mind to any mans person, neither in preju∣dice or envy against the Priests or the false prophets, but a∣gainst their evil actions which we see in them, which we loath and detest; for never did the true Prophets of the Lord seek their gain from their Quarter, as these Priests now do in this generation, nor ever did they sue men at law for Tithes, as these Priests do now, neither did they the Lord sent forth to declare his mind and will make bargains with people for so much a year, or abide in one Town for many years together, as these Priests do now, nay they went from one place to ano∣ther, from City to City, and from Country to Country, in obedience to the Command of the Lord, as Ieremiah and the rest of the true Ministers did, to whom the Word of the Lord came, saying, I have ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations, Mark, not to a Town or a City, to remain in for many years together, but to the Nations, and in obedience to the living God, he te∣stified against the World that their deeds were evil, but they could not bear his words, but said he was worthy to die, and so the Priests and false Prophets joyned with the Princes and Rulers of the people, and cast him into prison and into the dungeon, where he did sink amongst the mire that was in it, Read in his prophesie and you will find it so, and this was that which the true Prophets and Ministers of Christ received from the World where they went, stocking, whipping and Impri∣sonments; thus were they requited evil for good in all Ages, for their love which they did bear to the souls of the Sons of men, and the same must we expect from this generation where∣in we live, we whom the Lord hath called to place his Name in, and hath sent us forth in this day of his love, to preach his Everlasting Gospel to them which dwell upon the earth, in love and pity to their souls, but they regard it not, though we go thousands of miles for the Seeds sake which lies in death, yet the reward of our labour from them is prisons, and whips to scourge us withal, and knives prepared to cut off ears, and I∣rons hot to burn in the hand; thus are we requited evil for good, for testifying against the World that their deeds are evil, and therefore do they hate us as they did Christ and his Apo∣stles, and calls us Deceivers, Fools and Hereticks, Jesuites and the like, because we speak the truth to them, and cannot
joyn with them in their abominations, but stands as witnesses for the Lord God against them; therefore do the Priests and Rulers joyn hand in hand together against us, as they did a∣gainst the true Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, as you may read in the Scriptures of Truth, which bear Testimony to these things. So dear Neighbours and People where this may come, consider my end in writing this unto you, the Lord is my wit∣nesse, that this is not written as to set up our selves and pull down others, but it is written for your sakes that you might come so see the deceit of your own hearts, which hath long lodged in you, and also the deceit of the Priests in this gene∣ration, that seek their gain from their quarter, and keeps you captive in Babylon and Aegypt, where our Lord is crucified, as they did many of us in time past, where we were bewitched by their sorceries and their smooth words, in speaking peace to us wen our soules lay in death, unconverted in our fallen estates, as they are at this day▪ so they could not help us out of it, being in it themselves; Thus were we led by them in blind∣nesse for many years together, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth by them; if the Lord had not looked upon us with an eye of pity, we had surely perished un∣der their Teaching, because they are out of the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, who was sent to open blinde eyes, and turn People from darknesse to the light of Christ in them, and from the Power of Satan to God; but these Priests labour in this generation to keep people in darknesse, in blindnesse, and in ignorance, in Death, in their unconverted estate, that so they might not see their deceit as we do; the Lord open your eyes that you may see how you have been led astray out of the true way which leads unto Eternal Life; Oh! my love in tendernesse runs out to you all, my dear neighbours and ac∣quaintance, in Bowels of compassion and pity to your Souls, which lies in Death as mine hath done, but the Lord in his Eternal love and pity to my Soul, hath redeemed me from my fallen estate, and raised my Soul from Death to Life, and out of the Pit wherein it lay dead in trespasses and sins, and seeing the Lord hath done this for me, I cannot but declare it to the Sons of men, and praise his Name in the Land of the living, who hath done great things for me, and when I consi∣der and ponder it in my heart, my Soul is ravished with his
love, and broken into teares to consider his kindnesse toward me, who was by Nature a Child of wrath as well as other; Oh! the consideration of his love hath constrained me to fol∣low him, and to give up all for his sake, if it be for the laying down of my life; for none are the Disciples of Christ, but they that follow him in the Crosse, and through sufferings, and they that love any thing more then Him, are not worthy of Him; Now minde well and consider what I say, the true un∣feigned love to God doth not break the love from one another, but it breakes the bands of wickednesse, as Strife, Debate, Anger, and Envie, that have lodged in the mind one against another, and when these things are destroyed in men and wo∣men, then comes the love of God to abound in them and en∣crease one to another, and this I witnesse, and the Lord bear∣eth me testimony to what I speak, that my love is dearer and nearer to those in relation to me than ever it was before, and I know some of them feels it so, yea the Lord knows my heart whom I serve, that I lie not, but speak the truth to you all, that so you might not stumble, nor have any prejudice in your mindes against me without a cause, who am a lover of all your Soules, and for that cause is this written to you, that you may know it is so, for the Lord knows I do not forget you, though I be thousands of miles from you, because of the simplicity that was in some of you who were my neighbours and acquaint∣ance, for I am one who have obtained mercy from the Lord, through judgement and great tribulation, which all must passe through before they come into the Land of Canaan, they must be regenerate and born again, and know a dying to sin, and that which they have delighted in before they witnesse a li∣ving to Righteousnesse, the Old man must be put off with his deeds before the new man be put on, Christ Jesus the Son of the living God, who is the expresse Image of his Fathers Glo∣ry, who is taking his People to himself out of the  of the Beast and false Prophets, who have long made a prey upon them, but the day is come that they shall make no longer a prey upon them, for the Lord hath said it that he will teach his Peo∣ple himself, and under his Government shall they dwell safely from the devourer and venemous beasts, which hath long had his seat in the Earth amongst the Sons of men, and by him they have been led Captive at his will, to do his work and ser∣vice, for it was pleasing to them, thus hath the Devils work been
done for a long time together, and the Lords work neglected which should have been done; Thus have men and women been growing as trees of unrighteousnesse, bringing forth fruit to the unrighteous one, the prince of darknesse which hath long regned, and had possession in the heart of man; So all dear people consider well of your conditions, that you may see what Trees you are and to whom you bring forth fruit▪ and this concerns you all to know, from the least of you to the greatest, for the Lord is no respecter of persons, but in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteousnesse is ac∣cepted of him, who is our hiding Place, and Rock of sure de∣fence for us to flie unto, where we are kept safe in the hollow of his hand▪ So dear neighbours and People consider, that you have long been labouring for the meat that must perish & come to an end, now it stands you all in hand to seek after the living Bread and hidden Manna that comes down from above, and is given to feed the Hungry, and strengthen the feeble minded, and verily it is so, in love and plainnesse to you do I speak, that you who can live without this living Bread, your Souls lies in Death still, and the witnesse lies slain in Sodom and Egypt in you, and the Seed lies covered under the Clods of the Earth in you, and unlesse it arise and live in you, you cannot be saved nor enter into the land of Rest which is prepared for the Faith∣ful, who are regenerate and born again of the Holy Seed, which shall inherit the blessing, the Son of God which is Heire of the Promise, and in him is our life hid with God, from the vul∣turous eye and venemous Beast, and from the Lord are we re∣freshed day by day. So dear People, let the witnesse of God arise and be awakened in you all, that the seed may come forth from under the Clods of your hard and stony hearts, that so the prisoner may be set at liberty, which long hath been op∣pressed, and for the sake of it in you am I constrained to write unto you, not knowing whether I may see your faces in the flesh any more yea or nay; Oh! that you would lay these things to heart, which I in love have written to you, not knowing how soon your breath may be stopt, and your life ta∣ken from you, and as Death leaves you, so must you appear be∣fore the Lord and be judged according to your doings. So dear hearts, do not sleight the day of your visitation nor the tenders of Gods love which is yet held forth to you, least you
be taken away in your sins, and die in your iniquities, and then I know your portion will be sad; Therefore do I warn you in Bowels of tender love, and in pity to the Captive in you, that you run no longer in your former vanities, in spending your time out of the fear of God, for all they that live out of the fear of God, do not feel his presence, nor enjoy his blessing; So all hearken to the Counsel of God, and be attentive to his Voice, and lend your ear to his Call, while he is knocking at the door of your hearts; Oh! do not resist him but let him in that he may take possession whose right it is, for verily if you resist him when he calls upon you, and will not lend your ears to his Counsel nor give ear to his Words, a day of trouble and perplexity of Spirit will assuredly come upon you, then will you call upon the Lord but he will not hear you, but will hide his face from you, even so will it be with you at that day, because the Lord called and you would not hear him, so when you call upon him he wil not hear you; And this from the Lord God I declare unto you, that if you perish your destruction is of your selves, and the Lord will be cleare of your blood in the day of your account. So dear people, let the patience and forbearance of our God towards you lead you to repent∣ance, & now no longer go on in sin against that of God in your Consciences, but all stoop down to the witnesse of God in you, that the Seed may arise to live in you, for the blessing is upon England for the Seeds sake, which God hath raised, and it is growing, and the vertue of it is spreading over the Nati∣ons, and the Kingdom of Christ begins to flourish in the Earth, but this I say unto you, that unlesse you feel the Seed of God to arise and live in you, you cannot inherit the bles∣sing, for the blessing is to the Seed, the Plant of Gods Renown, which he hath regard unto, for it is of his Nature and Image, and proceeds from him who is meek and lowly, and easie to be entreated by the upright, for his ear is open to their cry, who hungers and thirsts after his presence to refresh their Souls; So dear people, lie no longer in Death, but come out of the Grave of Carnal security wherein you lie, that your Souls may live, then will you prize with me the love and presence of the Lord above all things; But unlesse that be restored to life in you which lies in Death, you cannot prize the love of God, for you do not feel his presence, and this you know by experience,
that a dead Child is not sencsible of want, neither doth it hun∣ger after the breast, but a living Child that is born into the World is soon sencible of want, and in it is a hunger raised after the milk which comes from the breast to refresh it withal, for it cannot live with∣out it, or some other food like unto it, and this is a true figure to you and all, and thorow it you may read your selves, and how your conditions are every one in particular, that so you may no longer be deceived, nor rest in a false hope which will faile you, and even so it is with you all who never found a true hunger raised after the Lord and after his Presence to refresh your Souls; but you who can live content and rest satisfied without nourishment from him, you are as a dead Child which feels no hunger nor want, and this is the truth to you all, the Lord revive your sences, and quicken your un∣derstandings that you may be sencible how your conditions are▪ which is the desire of my Soul, that so you may not perish in your gain-sayings, and for this very end is this written to you, as I was moved of the Lord in bowels of compassion to you, knowing that you are where I once was in the perishing state, like the Prodigal from the Fathers House, in the far Country, feeding upon the husks with the swine; and this was my state and condition for many years, but in the time appointed the Lord looked upon me with an eye of pity, and called me home to himself, out of the far Country, where I was feeding on the husks with the swine, into the banqueting-house, where my soul is refreshed, nourished and fed with the hidden Manna and bread of Life, which is prepared for the hungry and feeble∣minded to feed upon. So all dear people turn in your minds, and read within, I speak not to the thing without, for all they that go from the Lord they go into the strange land, into the far Country, and all such are Adulterers that spends their portion upon Harlots, and hides their talent in the earth, which was given them to profit withal, and all such are wan∣derers and vagabonds which have not a habitation in the Lord, in Cains nature, and though they may be builders of Cities, as Cain was, yet being from God as he was, they are strangers and wanderers, being seperated from the Lord, who hath pre∣pared a rest for his People, where they are safe and feeds toge∣ther in the good land, where they are at home with their Ma∣ker, who fills Heaven and Earth with his presence, glory unto
his Name for ever more. So all People turn home into your own tents, that you may see where you are, and what you are feeding upon, and wander no longer abroad with your minds in the earth, after that which will perish and come to an end, where the moth & rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal, and deprive you of your substance that you have ga∣thered together by fraud and deceit, which may be soon taken from you, and you left desolate, naked and bare; therefore it stands you all in hand to seek after that which will endure for ever, the Pearl of great price, which doth exceed all the trea∣sures in Aegypt, for its durable and will last for ever, the Rock of Ages on which the Saints was built, the chief Corner Stone Elect and Precious, the sure foundation of many generations, the pillar and ground of Truth, Christ the light the bright and morning Star, the Sun of Righteousnesse which is now arisen with healing in his wings, to cleanse the Lepar of his leprosie, and hath caused the dumb to speak and the deaf to hear his Voice and follow him, and this hath he done in this day of his power, which makes the Heathen to wonder and be con∣founded at his appearance in his Sons and Daughters, who beare his Image, who are meek and lowly, Lamb-like, the Righteous knows him who loves his appearance, but to the wicked his presence is dreadful and terrible like a Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah, to consume with the Breath of his Mouth, and break to pieces like a Potters vessel all the stiffe necked and strong ones who lives in the pride of their hearts and at ease in the flesh, like fat Bulls of Bashan, spending the Creation upon their Lusts; Oh the day is at hand that all such must be as chaffe before the wind, and as stubble before the fire which will con∣sume them, & leave them neither root nor branch, the Mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it; therefore take heed what you do, and follow not the multitude to do evil, for they walk in the broad way which leads to destruction and to the Cham∣bers of Death, where the Souls of men and women are plunged into misery and torment, and into the Pit of perdition, where they cannot come out nor be loosed from their cruel bonds, where they are chained and fettered fast, under the po∣wers of darknesse, who is King of the bottomlesse Pit, the old Dragon which goes about like a roaring Lyon seeking whom he may devour, and they that are from the watch,
watch, they are from the Rock and sure Foundation, Christ the Light and Life of his People, and all that are from him, they are in darknesse and such are taken in the snares of the Devil, who rules in the dark, for there he hath his seat, in the Earthly part of man which is one with him, who is the unclean spirit, which seeks to destroy and lay wast the Heritage of God, that so his kingdom might be set up, Who is a lier & a murder∣er; but now is the day come that Christ is risen to Reign as Lord and King in his People, & therefore doth Antichrist rage in his members because his destruction is at hand, and his torment is coming upon him, wherein he must have and receive a just recompence of his reward, and all that joyns with him must partake of his torment for what they have done against God and his People; And so dear Neighbours and People, joyn with him no longer who is the Enemie of God, least you be cut off from the Face of the Earth, and destroyed with Levia∣than that crooked Serpent, which must go into everlasting burn∣ing there to remain for evermore, where there is weeping and gnashing of Teeth, and no comfort nor ease to be found, but howling & bitter lamentation night and day, and this will be the portion of the wicked that live wantonly upon the Earth; Oh! the day will come that they will wish they had their time to spend over again, when their misery comes upon them, and the darts of the Almighty striks them & wounds them to the heart, then will their pain be great, which cannot be ex∣pressed, which they must feel night and day; Oh! that you would lay these things to heart, and consider your latter end, and this I speak in love to you all whether you will hear or forbear, you shall one day know and be made to confesse what is written to you is true; Therefore take heed what you do that resist and quench the motions of the Spirit of God in you, when it doth arise to shew you your conditions wherein you lie, for you that do resist the Lord in his way, you do despite unto the Spirit of Grace; So dear people young and old, resist the Lord no longer in his appearance in you, for you that do, you slay the witnesse the Messenger of the Covenant in you, and so becomes guilty of blood; Therefore take heed of go∣ing on in the hardnesse of your hearts, and in speaking evil of the Truth, though Baalam erred from the Spirit of Truth, yet it was the same then that it is now, though Iudas betrayed
it, and Demas forsook it, and embraced the World, yet Truth is Truth, and will stand for ever over the heads of all its ene∣mies, and here comes the Scriptures to be fulfilled, for many are called but few are chosen; And this hath appeared in our Generation, that many have had a true taste of the love of God, and of the Powers of the World to come, but they are gone from it again, and are turned aside into the crooked path, like the Dog to his vomit, and like the Sow that was washed into the mire again, where they are defiled with the flesh-pots of Eypt, which they lusted after; Oh! mark and behold the end of all such that depart from the living God; Oh! is not the unclean spirit entered into them again, and be∣come worse then he was before, so none rejoyce at the hearing of those that turnes from the truth, which they were once in, for verily it will not ease you of your misery and torment which will come upon you if you go on in sin, and dispise the day of your visitation; So to you all I have cleared my con∣science in the sight of God, From a Friend of the Truth, and a sferer for the Seeds sake which is kept in Bondage un∣der Pharaoh and his Task-masters, my Name in the flsh is Marmaduke Stephenson.

R. This was written by William Robinson to the Court of Boston. ON the 8th day of the 4th Month 1659. in the after part of the day, in travelling betwixt Newport (on Rhode Island) and Daniel Goulds house, with my dear Brother Christopher Holder, the Word of the Lord came expresly to me, which did fill me immediately with life and power, and hea∣venly love, by which he constrained me and commanded me
to pass to the Town of Boston, my life to lay down in his Will, for the accomplishing of his service that he had there to perform at the day ap∣pointed; to which heavenly voice I presently yielded obedience, not questioning the Lord how he would bring the thing to pass, being I was a Child, and obedience was demanded of me by the Lord, who filled me with living strength and power from his Heavenly presence, which at that time did mightily over-shadow me,  my life did say Amen to what the Lord required of me,  commanded me to do, and willingly was I given up from that time to this day, the will of the Lord to do and perform whatever becomes of my body, for the Lord hath said unto me, My Soul shall rest in Eternal Peace▪ and my life shall enter into rest, for being obedient to the God of my life; I being a Child, and durst not question the Lord in the least, but rather willing to lay down my life, then to bring dishonour to the Lord; and as the Lord made me willing, dealing gent∣ly and kindly with me, as a tender Father towards a faithful Child whom he dearly loves, so the Lord did deal with me in Ministring of his life unto me, which gave and gives me strength to perform what the Lord hath required of me; and still as I did and do stand in need, he ministred, and ministreth more strength and vertue and heavenly power, and wisdom, whereby I was and am made strong in God, not fearing what man shall be suffered to do unto me, being filled with heavenly courage, which is, meekness and innocency, for the cause is the Lords that we go in, and the Battel is the Lords, and thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the mighty and terrible God, not by strength, nor by might, nor by power of man, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts I will perform what my mouth hath spoken, through my servants whom I have chosen, mine Elect, in whom my Soul delighteth. Friends, the God of my life, and the God of the whole earth, did lay this thing upon me, for which I now suffer bonds near to death; he by his Almighty power, and Everlasting love con∣strained me, and laid this thing upon me, and truly I could not deny the Lord, much less resist the Holy One of Israel: There∣fore all who are ignorant of the motion of the Lord in the inward parts, be not hasty in judging in this matter, before you hear the truth of the matter, least you speak evil of the things you know not; for of a truth the Lord God of Hea∣ven and Earth commanded me by his Spirit, and spoke unto
me by his Son, whom he hath made Heir of all things; and in his life I live, and in it I shall depart this earthly Tabernacle, if unmerciful men be suffered to take it from me; and herein I rejoice that the Lord is with me, the antient of dayes, the life of the Suffering Seed, for which I am freely given up, and singly do stand in the Will of God, for to me to live is Christ, but to dye is gain: And truly I have a great desire and will to dye herein, knowing that the Lord is with me, whatever ignorant men shall be able to say against me; for the witness of the Spi∣rit I have received, and the presence of the Lord and his Hea∣venly life doth accompany me, so that I can say in truth and from an upright heart, Blessed be the Lord the God of my life, who hath counted me worthy, and called me hereunto, to bear my Te∣stimony against ungodly and unrighteous men, who seek to take away the life of the righteous without a cause, as the Rulers of the Ma∣thathusets bay doth intend, if the Lord stop them not from their intent: Oh! hear ye Rulers, and give ear and listen all ye that have any hand herein to put the innocent to death; for in the Name, and Fear, and Dread of the Lord God, I here declare the cause of my staying here amongst you, and continuing in your jurisdiction, after there was a sen∣tence of banishment upon death (as you said) pronounced against me, without a just cause, as you all well know, that we who were banished committed nothing worthy of banishment, nor of any punishment, much less banishment upon death: And now ye Rulers, you do intend to put me to death with my companion, unto whom the Word of the Lord God came un∣to him saying, Go to Boston with thy Brother William Robinson; unto which Command he was obedient, who had said unto him, He had a great work for him to do; which thing is now seen, and the Lord is now a doing of it, and it is in obedience to the Lord the God of the whole earth that we continued amongst you, and that we came to the Town of Boston again in obedience to the Lord the Creator of Heaven and Earth, in whose hand your breath is; And will you put us to death for obeying the Lord the God of the whole earth? Well, if you do this act, and put us to death; know this, and be it known unto you all ye Rulers and People of this Jurisdiction, that who∣soever hath a hand herein will be guilty of innocent blood, and not onely upon your selves wll ye bring innocent blood, but upon this Town and the Inhabitants thereof, and
every where within your Jurisdiction, that had the least hand therein; therefore be instructed ye Rulers of this land, and take warning betimes, and learn wisdom before it be hid from your eyes. Written by one who feareth the Lord, who is by ignorant people called a Quaker, and unto such am on∣ly known by the name William Robinson, yet a new name I have received, which such knows not. Written in the com∣mon Goal in Boston. the 19th of the 8th month, 1659. A Relation from the two innocent Servants of the Lord, concerning the (bloody) Sentence of death passed on them by Iohn Indicott in the Court of Boston. ON the 20th day of the 8th Month, 1659. I with my beloved com∣panion, Marmaduke Stevenson▪ and Mary Dyer of Rhode Island was had into the Court, where John Indicott with others of his Councel were assembled, and soon after, we were come to the Bar before them, John Indicott called to the Keeper of the Prison to pull off our Hats, which was done accordingly; when did John Indicott begin to speak unto us as a man out of the dust, whose life is departing from him, so faintly did he utter his words unto us, to this effect, That they had made several Laws, and tryed and endeavoured by several wayes to keep us from among them, and neither whipping, nor imprisoning, nor cutting off ears, nor banishing upon pain of death, would not keep us from a∣mongst them; and he said also, He or they desired not the death of any of us; yet notwithstanding his following words were, Give ear & hearken now to your Sentence of Death, said John Indicott their Governour; so after these words were spoken by him he stopt, the words being uttered very faintly out of his mouth; then I did make way to speak to John Indicott and the rest of the Court, which was as I remember to this effect, I desired I might read a Paper to them and the people there present (which was many) which was a Declaration of my Call, wherein was declared the Reasons and Causes of my staying in their Iurisdiction with my Companion, after banishment upon death, which had been pronounced against us, and two more friends
(the one of which is a sufferer now with us) on the 8th day of the 7th month last; at which words speaking, John Indicott their Governour in a fu∣rious manner (for rage and madness like Nebuchadnezzar was got up in him) said, I should not read it, neither would they hear it read; which thing onely at that time I desired before the sentence of death was pronounced against us, yet he would not grant it; so I seeing, and being sensible of their hardness of heart that they are given up to work wic∣kedness, and commit murder in labouring to take the lives of the innocent from the earth, I said unto them, seeing that I could not be suffered to read it in the hearing of the people, nor suffered to have it read unto the people that then was present, I said, I should leave the Paper with them, which I did soon cast upon the Table amongst them, and the Secretary or some other handed it to the Governour, who read it himself, but would not let it be read in the hearing of the people, and when he had looked a certain time on it, he called me by my name and said, I needed not have made such ado, or desired to have it read; for he said, I had spoke more then that unto them the day before concerning it; which I had not, for there is many words in the Paper which I did not then utter unto them; so that I desired the thing again, that all that was there present might bear it, but he would not suffer it; but soon after in envy called me by my name, and said unto me, Hearken unto your Sentence of death, which be uttered forth to this effect (in which time I was silent) he said William Robinson This is your Sentence, you shall be had back from the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, to be hanged on the Gallows, till you are dead; this was the Sen∣tence of death John Indicott their Governour pronounced against me, and soon after called to the Goaler to have me away, which he did accordingly. WILLIAM ROBINSON. SOon after my dear Brother W. R. was taken away out of the Court, the Governour being partial, spoke unto me, saying, If you have any thing to say, you may speak; but I was silent, and gave him no an∣swer then, so that when he saw that I would not speak, when he required of me, then he pronounced the Sentence of death against me, as he had upon my Brother before, You shall be had to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the Gallows, and there to be hanged, until you be dead; then did these words following run through me, Give ear ye Magistrates, and all who are guilty, for this the Lord hath said concerning you, who will perform his pro∣mise upon you, that the same day that you put his Servants to death, shall the day of your visitation pass over your heads, and
you shall be cursed for evermore, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it; therefore in love to you all take warning before it be too late, that so the curse might be removed, for assuredly if you put us to death, you will bring innocent blood upon your own heads, and swift distruction will come upon you: So after these words were spoken unto them, I was had to Prison again, where my Brother was. MARMADUKE STEVENSON. THE like Sentence did John Indicott their Governour pronounce a∣gainst Mary Dyer, after M.S. was had away, Mary Dyer you shall go to the place from whence you came, namely the Prison, and from thence to the place of Execution, and be hanged there, till you are dead; I said, the Will of the Lord be done; take her away Marshal; I said yea, and joyfully I go; and in the way to the Prison of∣ten used such speeches with praises to the Lord for the same; I said to the Marshal, let me alone, for I should go to Prison without him; I believe you Mrs. Dyer, said he, but I must do what I am commanded. MARY DYER. This is a Copy of M. S. Letter to the Lords People. OH! my dear and well-beloved ones, who are sealed with me in the holy Covenant of our Fathers love, my love and life runs out to you all who are chosen of God and faithful, for you are dear unto me, the Lord knows it, and are as seals upon my breast, you lambs of my Fathers Fold, and sheep of his Pasture, the remembrance of you is pretious to me my dear∣ly beloved ones, who are of the Holy Seed and bears the right Image, which springs from the true vine and off-spring of David, and stock of Abraham the Father of the faithful, and the redeemed ones who are reconciled to God and one to another, in that which Sea and Land cannot separate, where you may feel me knit and joined to you with the Spirit of Truth, and linked to you as members of his body, who is our Head and Rock of sure defence for us to flye unto, where we are kept safe in the hour of temptation, and in the day of Tryal shall we be preserved in the hollow of his hand, where his Banner of love will be over us, to compass us about, where we shall have recourse to the living springs which comes from the pure fountain and well-spring of life, which issues forth abundantly, to refresh the hun∣gry and strengthen the feeble minded, where you may feel me my beloved ones in the green pastures, among the lillies of the pleasant springs, where

And this vvill be the portion of our Cup, if vve all stand stedfast to that vve have received, and be faithful in our measures, in doing the Will of God vve shall find peace and unity vvith the Lord, vvhich is joy unspeaka∣ble and glorious, vvhich vvill never be taken from us; So dear hearts, let us all press forvvard to the mark of the High Calling, so shall vve obtain the Crovvn from him, vvhere our lives are hid vvith Christ in God, vvhere vve shall remain for ever vvith him after our Testimony is finished,  shall lay dovvn our heads vvith joy and peace, and receive the reward of everlasting life, vvhich is laid up for us in Christ Iesus; Oh! my beloved ones, vvho are of the Royal Seed vvhich the Lord hath blessed, my life
bound up vvith you in the Holy Covenant, vvhere vve are linked together as in a Chain, and moulded into one mould, vvhere nothing must remain that is not good, for it must be purged out that vvould defile, that so so vve may appear like the fine Gold vvhich is tryed in the fire, to shine forth in the Image of the Father as lights to the world, and as Cities set on a Hill vvhich cannot be hid, so vvill the Lord have praise to vvhom it is due, by our upright vvalking and honest conversation, so shall vve all be a svveet smell and a good savour in them that are saved and in them that perish; Oh! my dear Friends and Brethren, hovv doth my love a∣bound tovvards you, Oh! feel it and let it fill your hearts, for verily you are dear to me, the Lord knovvs it vvhom I  that you are often in my remembrance, though my body be far beyond the Seas separated from you, yet doth my Soul and life remain vvith you in the Holy Covenant sealed by the Spirit of Promise, vvhere vve shall remain together in rest and svveet peace for evermore after our Testimony is finished: So all you vvho are upright in heart, feel my love and receive my Salutation vvhich springs from the Fountain of love, where I am vvith you as by the vvaters of Shilo vvhich runs softly, vvhere we are watered and refreshed together day by day, that so we grow as Plants of Righteousness in the true vine where we are re∣conciled to the Father, and one to another in that which Sea and Land cannot separate, where you may all feel me and read me in your hearts, with that which was before words were, and if I never see your faces more in the flesh, the will of the Lord be done, for verily my life is not dear to me, to lay it down for his sake who hath called me out of darkness into his mar∣vellous light, and hath counted me worthy to bear witness of his truth a∣mongst a blood-thirsty people, whose hearts are removed far from the Lord, that so I may finish my Testimony with joy, as the rest of my Brethren have done which are gone before me, for I am freely given up with my dear Brother called William Robinson, whse love is dear to you all, to lay down our lives as a witness against this people; for us to live is Christ, but to dye is gain, for we know that our reward is sure, where we shall en∣joy the pure presence of the living God, and be in favour with him for ever∣more; Oh! how doth my love abound and run out in tenderness to you all, Oh! my tongue cannot express it, nor my mouth utter it forth as it flowes out to you from the living streams which waters the whole City of God, Oh! feel it and be refreshed. M. S. This is a Copy of W. R. his Letter to the Lords People. THe streames of my Fathers love runs daily through me from the Holy Fountain of Life, to the Seed throughout the whole Creation; I am
overcome with love, for it is my life and length of my dayes, its my glory and my daily strength, I am swallowed up with love, in love I live, & with it I am overcome, and in it I dwell with the Holy Seed, to which the blessing of love is given from God who is love, who hath shed it abroad in my heart which daily fills me with living joy from the Life from whence it comes; You Children of the living God, feel me when you are waiting in it, when your hearts and minds are gathered into it, when in the strength of it you are traveling feel me, when it runs from the fountain into your vessel, when it issues gently like new wine into your bosoms, when the strength and power of it you feel, when you are overcome with the strength of love (which is God) then feel me pre∣sent in the fountain of love, wherein are many Mansions; you Children of the Lord feel me wrapt up with you in the pure love, which destroyes the love which is in enmity with God, which warreth against the Seed which proceedeth from the Father of Love, the God of Truth; Let nothing seperate you from this Love which is my life, neither words nor thoughts nor nothing else enter be∣twixt which is contrary to it, for that will stain the place of its abode; So dear Children who are begotten by love into the Covenant of life and love, keep daily in it, this is the portion that God hath given to his Children to continue in his love which is the life of the Seed, which is raised by the power of the endlesse love of God in the Creature; I am full of the quickning Power of the Lord Iesus Christ▪ and my Lamp is filled with pure Oyl, so that it gives a clear light and pleasant smell, and I shall enter with my beloved into E∣ternal peace and rest, wherein I am swallowed up, with the life of it I am filled, and with it I shall depart with everlasting joy in my heart, and praises in my mouth, singing Halelujah unto the Lord, who hath redeemed me by his living Power, from amongst Kindreds Tongues and Nations; And now the day of my departure draweth near, I have fought a good fight, I have kept the holy Faith▪ I have near finished my course, my travel∣ling is near at an end, my Testimony is near to be finished, and an Eternal Crown is laid up for me, and all whose fret are shed with Righteousnesse and the preparation of Peace, even such whose names are written in the Book of Life, wherein I live and rejoyce with all the Faithful Seed for evermore. Written by a Servant of Jesus Christ, William Robinson. The 23. day of the 8th Month, was this given forth, and he suffered the 27th. day of the same Moneth at Bo∣ston in New England 1659. This is a Copy of Peter Pearsons Letter wherein is a Relation of M. S. and W. Rs. suffering. DEar Brethren unto whom my life is united in the invisible unlimited power of the Lord God Almighty, I give you a relation of divers pas∣sages,
wherein is tidings of heavinesse and joy; Our dear brethren the two Servants of the Lord, William Robinson, and Marmaduke Ste∣phenson, have finished their course in the pure dominion and Eternal Majestie of the Almighty God, and are laid down in Abrahams bosome in the Heavenly Kingdom of endlesse felicity, where the life of all the upright is united with their life to all perpetuity; So that their memorial shall ne∣ver rot, for their name their life is left upon heavenly record, and shall never be blotted out from the life of the Tribe of the Faithful. Vpon the 9th. day of the 4th. moneth 1659. the 4th. day of the week had all us English Friends that were abroad in this Country a meeting upon Road Island, the 6th. day following of the same week at a Ferry side upon Road Island, did one friend whose name is William Leddra and I part with Christopher Holder, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson, we being about to passe over the Ferry, to travel into this part of the Countrey called Plimmouth Colony; At the end of two dayes journey we came to a Town therein called Sandwich, and the day following had a pretty peace∣able meeting, and it was with us if we did escape apprehending in this Co∣lony, to have traveled into Bostons Iurisdiction, but the second and last meeting that we had determined to have at Sandwich, in it we were appre∣hended and had before the Governour and Magistrates, and by them commit∣ted to this Prison, where we have remained 5. moneths and upward; And being we deny to defray the charges that they have brought themselves into by medling with us (namely their wicked Officers fees,) and also refusing to make an engagement to come into the government no more, we are by their Law to remain close prisoners during the Courts pleasure; But well con∣tent we are, rejoycing that we are worthy to suffer as witnesses for the Lord against them, and their Law, and the thick power of darknesse by which they did establish it; This knowing that for our Testimonies sake bonds must abide us during the Lords pleasure; The day after we were taken Prisoners, was William Robinson, and Marmaduke Stephenson imprisoned at Boston, where they remained until the 7th. Moneth; in the forepart of the 7th. Moneth they were had before their Court of Assistance, and after di∣vers passages in their examination, the Iury (whom they witnessed a∣gainst as unfit men to try their cause being out of the Doctrine of Christ) when they gave in their verdit, said they had found them to be Quakers; So when they were found and judged by their ungodly Law, to be guilty of the sentence of Banishment upon pain of Death, they were returned to Prison a∣gain, and after a little time were had again before their Iudgment Seat, and the sentence of banishment upon pain of Death past upon them, against which their Life did arise in power and dominion, being the Lord had com∣manded them to stay, and William Robinson declared unto them how it stood between them and God, and if they did put them to Death for trans∣gressing
their commandement, they would become guilty of Innocent blood, and gave them warning in the Name of the Lord to beware of shedding inno∣tent blood, with more expressions that cut them to the quick; And although they had passed the sentence of Banishment upon them, yet this overplus to vent their furious mindes in torturing the outward man whilest they had it, they made a decree to have William whipt, and commanded the Constable to get a man that was able to do it; So a man being prepared and had be∣fore their Court, and judged a man fit for their purpose, they had William Robinson into the open street, and there stript him and put his hands thorow the holes of the Cariage of a great Gun, where the Iaylor (a member of their Church held them till the whipper gave him twenty stripes with a threefold Cord whip with knots at the ends, which stripes he laid upon his body without mercy or pity according to the hearts desire of some of the blood-thirsty rulers, who bad whip him severely; So when they had inflicted this barbarous action upon his body, then they returned him with Marmaduke Stephenson again to Prison, and wrote an order to the Iaylor to dischage the Prison of them forthwith; The Iaylor when he had taken W. Rs. great Coat from him, turned them out of the Prison, and after some stay in the Town according to their freedom, past abroad into the Countrey within their Iurisdiction, entering into great service and sounding thorow a dark cloudy Countrey which had not been broken thorow before, wherein was found honest desires, and divers were convinced, the Power of the Lord accompanied them, and with astonishment confounded their enemies before them, great was their service abroad in that Iurisdiction for 4. weeks and upwards, and having acquitted themselves like men, upon the 13th. day of the 8th. moneth they re∣turned again to Boston with six friends that did accompany them, and one friend that went out of this Government and met them near Boston, where they were all apprehended and had before the Governour and some of the Counsel; The seven friends were all committed to prison, and M. S. and W. R. were delivered to the custody of the Goalour to be kept in Chaines in a room by themselves, the which was done, they were shut up in a room by themselves, and chaines laid upon their right legs; the next week their ge∣neral Court began, before which they were had and sentenced to die, and so returned to prison again; upon the 27th. day of the same month was the day appointed that they were to be executed, the night before they had notice given of it, then the latter part of the 27th. day▪ being the 5th. day of the week after their lecture so called, W. R. and M. S. were had forth of the Pri∣son into the open street, where was one James Oliver who was made C∣tain over a band of armed men, by information 2. hundred, which were pre∣pared to guard them to and at the place of execution, with Drum Colours and Halberds, Guns, Swords, Picks and half-picks,  others on Horseback, to keep off the multitude of
dear Lambs near the hinder part, and the chief Marshal and the Drummer next before them, the command being given to march to the place of execution, W. R. spake these words saying, this is your hour and the power of darknesse, then the Drummer beat up his drum▪ and after a little space ceased again; Then M. Sephenson spake saying this is the day of your visitation, wherein the Lord hath visited you, other words past which were not clearly heard▪ by reason of the sound of the Drum; So they walked along in pure retired chearfulnesse to the place of execution, triumphing in the strength of the Lamb over all the wrath of man and fury of the beast▪ in the pure retired Heavenly dominion of the invisible God; And when they were come to the Ladders foot, they took their leave each of other and W. R. stept up the Ladder and spake to the People, saying this is the day of your visitation wherein the Lord hath visited you, this is the day the Lord is arisen in his mighty Power to be avenged on all his adversaries, and the rope being about his neck, as he spake the executioner bound his legs and hands, and his neck cloth being tyed about his face, he said now ye are made manifest; so the executioner being a∣bout to turn him off the Ladder, he uttered this expression, saying, I suffer for Christ in whom I live, and for whom I die; So he being turned off, M. S. went up and spake to the People, saying, be it known unto all this day that we suffer not as evil doers but for Conscience sake; then be being bound according to the former manner, as the Executioner was about to turn him off the Ladder, he uttered these words, saying, this day shall we be at rest with the Lord; Thus the Faithful witnesses sealed their Testimony for the Lord against the Dragons power, and blessedly departed with praises in their mouthes, entering joyfully with their beloved into Ever∣lasting Rest. Peter Pearson. Written in Plimmoth Prison in New Eng∣land, the 6th. of the 10th. moneth, 1659. MAry Dyer an Inhabitant in some part of that Countrey, was likwise sen∣tenced to die when these two friends, were only for coming a second time to Boston, to visit her imprisoned Brethren there, and was carried with them to the place of Execution, and after they two was executed, she stept up the Ladder and had her Coats tied about her Feet, and the Rope put about her neck, with her , and as the Hangman was ready to turn her off, they cryed out stop, for she was reprieved, and loosing her feet and bid her come down, but she was not forward to comedown, but stood still saying, she was there willing to suffer as her Brethren did; unlesse they would null their wicked Law, she had no freedom to accept their reprief, but they pulled her down, and a day or two after carryed her out of Townby force; And yet the Rulers of Boston had the impudence to affirm (in their Apologie published to vindicate their barbarous proceedings against the Innocent) that this Mary Dyer accepted her life, promising or consenting that she would depart their Jurisdiction in few dayes and return no more; thus do they make lies their refuge, and add iniquity to sin. THE END.
