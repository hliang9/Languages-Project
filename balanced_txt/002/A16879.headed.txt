To the right Honou∣rable, Henry Earle of Huntingdon, Lord Hastings, Hungerford, Botre∣aux, Molines and Moiles, my singular good Lord. I Haue studied (right Ho∣nourable) what way I might manifest my thāk∣full minde, for the excee∣ding fauours, wherewith I and mine are bound vn∣to your house for euer. I finde none more likely, then if I might adde somewhat (af∣ter the faithfull and happy trauels of o∣thers) to your present and immortall ho∣nour. Considering therefore, that the God of heauen, hath set you in so high a place, not onely in his owne eye, but also in the view of your countrey, to be beholden of all, as a marke, for the saluation or per∣dition of very many, and that little faults in your Honour, must needs much blemish
you, as a vertuous life shall make you glo∣rious: I haue indeuored for my part to put into your handes a true glasse and per∣fect mappe:Iam. 1. 25., a glasse which will not flatter you in shewing your spotts, because it is the Lordes, a mappe which will not deceiue you, for the narrow way of life, because it is bounded by the Lord himselfe, troden by our Sauiour, with all his holy Saintes, which haue gone before you; yet so small as you may euer carrie in your bosome. My humble suite at the hāds of the Lord and your honour is this, that when you haue tried them to bee such, (where the superstitious Papists spend some houres in blind deuotions) you would bind your selfe by a constant vow before the Lord, to spēd but one houre weekely, besides other your holy exercises, in vewing your selfe in this Christal glasse,Iam. 1. 23. 24. 25. desirous to clense your spotts hereby; and to consider your waies according to this map,Psal. 119. 59. labouring so to di∣rect your steppes: for setting your selfe with resolute purpose of heartActs. 11. 23. to walke herein all your dayes, you haue the Lords
owne promise, that he will make you tru∣ly honorable in the sight of all men,1. King. 3. 11. 12. 13. as e∣uer was any of your Progenitors, so as your very enemies shall acknowledge it,Dent. 4. 6. 7. & 28, 10. 11. 12. 13. and hee afraid of you: and that he will moreouer prolong your dayes, and giue you a gard of his glorious Angels for your safetie,Psa. 91. 11. 12. and 34. 7. to beare you in their handes in the day time, and in the night season, when you are se∣cure, to pitch their tents about you: your country shall bee blessed, that euer God vouchsafed such a light vnto it.1. King. 10. 8. 9. Where any point seemes doubtfull there make a marke.Phil. 3. 15. walke in the rest vntill the Lorde cleare that vnto you. As this shall adde vnto mee ioy,2. Ioh. 1. 2. 3. 4. so for thousands which now pray for the encrease of this honour, manie times ten thousands shall euer praise the God of heauen for you. Now is the time, all mens eyes are vpon you. Your honor knoweth the prouerbe well. Magistratus virum indicat. Striue forward cheereful∣ly (most noble Earle) in this narrow waie of life,Mat. 7. 14. according to the hopes now long conceiued of you, following herein all the
worthies of the heauenly Hierusalem,Apoc. 21. 26. 27. and you shall liue with them immortallie; but if you should turne to the broad waie of all the worlde (which the Lord forbid) you must perish with the world eternally.Apoc 22. 14. 15. Mat. 7. 13. The Angell hath sworne it,Mar. 8. 38. Time shall be no more,Apo. 10. 6. but how soone it is vnknowne vnto you.Luk. 12. 20. 21. 34. 35. 36.

To the Christian Reader. COnsidering (christian Reader) that in euerye place, all those who haue found any sound comfort in the Gospel, are desirous to expresse the same in their conuersations, by walking in thankfulnesse as it becommeth the seruants of Christ, to adorne their pro∣fession, and yet notwithstanding the greatest part do much fayle herein: I haue thought it my bounden duety to afford vnto thē such helpe as God hath vouchsafed mee in this behalfe. For alasse it it too manifest, that too many euen of them, do omit sundry and those of most necessary dueties, as by looking perhaps to some of the dutyes of the first Table, neglect the second, or to the second onely omit the first, which is called the great commaundement: or looking onely to the law, are too short for the gospel:
or boasting of faith regard not works. Others lie in fearefull sinnes thorough ignorance hereof. And very many are obserued dayly to fal into grieuous of∣fences, to the dishonour of Christ, and discredit of their profession, yea to the griefe of the godly, offending the weake, hardning the vngodly eye, to open the mouthes of the Papists, and Atheists, with all the profane, to blas∣pheme that glorious name whereby we are called. And not onely so, but more also to the wounding of their owne consciences, and giuing aduan∣tage to Sathan, to accuse them before the Lord. Nay sundrye of most vp∣right hearts, and who haue made good proceedings in godlinesse, are yet known to lie languishing vnder the burthen of their sinnes, and feare of Gods displeasure, thorough want of knowledge howe to finde out their speciall offences, whereby their con∣sciences are disquieted, & Gods hand doth lie so heauily vpon them: Many
liuing in continuall doubt whether they bee in the fauour of God or no: great multitudes in all places ordina∣rily thrusting themselues vnreuerent∣ly into the presence of the Lord, to the word, sacraments, and all other exercises of the seruice of God, with∣out any examination, or preparation of their hearts before, to the prouok∣ing of the grieuous wrath of the Lord thereby. Now for these (I say) and for al other, whose desire is to walke with God, and be pleasing vnto him, fin∣ding the true felicity that is in godli∣nesse, I haue thought my selfe bounde by the Communion of Saints, to offer this my poore labour, which first was vndertaken for my selfe and some few of my christian friends: the better to preuent all the former euills, and for the more easye obtayning the bene∣fits following such a carefull watch. Herein I haue vsed the helpe of sun∣dry learned and godly diuines, fol∣lowing chiefely the direction of these
two holy men of GOD, Maister Greenham and Maister Perkins; whose writings were the first occasions of thinking hereof:M. Greenhā in the com∣fort of an afflicted conscience pag. 130. the one requiring this examination necessarily vnto true and sound repentance,M. Perkins. of the pra∣ctise of re∣pentance. cap. 7. the other for the thorough curing of the wounded conscience. And hence also I haue bin more incouraged, to make this pub∣like, not vpon any vaine or by respect, but by some gracious experience of the profit hereof in both accordingly: especially in restoring some of no meane note, from much trouble, and horrour of conscience, to exceeding ioy, and strong assurance, when all o∣ther means haue fayled. Neither can this seeme strange to any considering it aright; for what is it that brings that peace and ioy of conscience passing all vnderstanding to a Christian soule but an assured testimony of our con∣science, that we doe not lie in any one sinne, so farre as by wise searching wee are able to finde it out, but hate
and abhorre euen the very least? and contrarily, that we haue begun, and so striue on forward to walke in euery commandement of God without re∣proofe: and that of true loue to our Lord and Sauiour: for to such a soule onely all the promises doe appertaine, as they are applyed thorough the whole Booke of GOD. In a word, I haue beene more imboldened, by obseruing dayly, how on the one side the godly preachers, vpon euery oc∣casion, calling men to repentance, ex∣hort all earnestly with the Prophet Ie∣remy to examine and try their wayes,Lā. 39. 40. & turne againe vnto the Lord, if euer they will find mercy with him: which worke of examinatiō hardly one of a thousād knoweth how to performe in any good measure, as may bring true cōfort vnto their soules. And on the o∣ther side, how many of our simple se∣duced brethrē, haue bin drawn to a dis∣like of our religiō & a liking of popery, by this especially, because ours, (as they
say) is a religion of carnall libertye, theirs of holinesse, ours full of diuisi∣ons and vncertainty, theirs of perfect vnity, that they also may see hereby, that ours is indeede a religion of per∣fect holinesse and vnity prescribed by the Lord himselfe, whereunto so many of vs as are truely called to the sound profession of it, do striue instantly to attaine day and night: so worshipping the God of our fathers, in spirit and trneth: walking in the selfe same nar∣row way of eternall life. And that all their imagined holinesse is nothing for the most part, but meere superstitiō, in outward shewes, of mens inuentions, concerning which, GOD will aske them one day,Esa. 1. 12. who hath required thē at their hands,Deu. 4. 2. & 12. . 32. altogether neglecting most of the duetyes of true piety, as those of the first table: that so they perceiuing how they haue beene de∣deluded,Act. 13. 48 (may at least some of them whom God hath ordayned vnto life) come out off the snare of the deuill,2. Tim. 2. 25. 26.
and ioyne themselues to vs againe:Ap. 14. 9. 10. 11. so to escape that torment which all that receiue the marke of the beast, by any such submission to that Romane An∣tichrist, must eudure for euermore. Pardon mee therefor, that I haue pre∣sumed to offer this vnto thee, seeing that how plaine so euer it is, yet it may proue profitable (as I hope) to manye thousand poore soules, who want lea∣sure or ability to search greater vo∣lumes, being so briefe and easie for all: and also that it may be to mee as the widowes mite, throwne into the trea∣sure of the Lord, If thou be one who by reason of thy ripenesse and perfect∣ion, despisest it, as hauing no neede of any such a helpe, yet haue compassion of thy brethren: neither knowest thou what a day may bring forth: or if thou seest the good that may come to very many by such a course, helpe to per∣fect, that which is here thus begun, or at least, if God shall perswade thee, of the benefit which thy selfe may reape
hereby spend one houre with mee constantly euery weeke, in trying thy wayes, and turning thy feeete vnto the testimonies of the Lord. And then, as I cannot doubt of thy prayers for me, so I assure my selfe that the chiefe com∣fort and blessing shal turne into thine owne bosome; thy Lord and Sauiour shall bee glorified by thee, the godly edified by thy holy ensample, the wic∣ked conuerted, or at the least haue their mouthes stop∣ped, and be left more without excuse.
Meditate seriously of these worthy places of scripture. Let not this booke of the law, depart out off thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou maiest obserue and do according to all that is written therin, for then shall thou make thy waies prosperous, & then shalt thou haue good successe. Ios. 1. 8. Blessed is the man that doth not walke in the councell of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sin∣ners, nor sit in the seat of the scornefull. Psal. 1. 1. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 2. For he shalbe like a tree planted by the riuers of water, that will bring forth her fruit in due season: whose leafe also shall not fade, so whatso∣euer he shall doe shall prosper. 3. The wicked are not so, but as the chaffe. &c. 4. VVhete withall shall a young man redresse his way in taking heede thereto according to thy word. Psa. 119. 9. I considered my wayes, and turned my feete vn∣to thy testimonies. vers. 59. I made hast and delayed not the time, to keepe thy commaundements. 60. Oh how loue I thy law? it is my meditatiō con∣tinually. 67. By thy commandement, thou hast made me wiser then mine enimies, for they are euer with mee. 98. I haue had more vnderstanding then all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation. 99. I vnderstood more then the ancient, because I kept thy precepts. 100.
I refrayned my feete from euery euil way, that I might keepe thy word. 101. Thy word is a lanthorne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my paths. 105. Thy testimonies are my delight & my coūcellors 24. They are better vnto mee, then thousands of gold and siluer. 72. The Lord is with you whilst you are with him, if you seeke him he will be found of you, but if you forsake him he will forsake you. 2. Ch. 15. 2. The hand of our God, is vpon all them that seeke him in goodnesse, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. Exr. 8. 22. The iust shall liue by faith, but if any withdraw himselfe, my soule shall take no pleasure in him. Heb. 10. 38. Because iniquity shalbe increased, the loue of many shall wax cold, but he that endureth to the end he shalbe saued. Mat. 24. 12. 13. Prou. 3. 21, 22. ad 26. et 4. 6, 19, 20, 21, 22 Iob. 22. 21, 22▪ 23. 10, 11, 12. 28. 28. Mat. 7. 13. 14. Apo. 22. 14. VVherefore is liuing man sorowful? man suf∣fereth for his sin. Let vs search & try our wayes, & turne againe vnto the Lord. Let vs lift vp our hearts with our hands to God in the heauens. Lam. 3. 39. 40, 41. VVhen I held my tongue my bones consumed, or when I roared all the day. Then I acknowledged my sin vnto thee, neither hid I myne Iniquity: for I thought I will confesse against my selfe, my wic∣kednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. Psa. 32. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Iob. 33. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28.
The triall of our estate. The meanes whereby we may obtaine a certaine assurance, that we are the children of God, and in his fauour, and also get the same more confirmed daylie. THe meanes is,2. Cor. 13. 5 by a carefull examina∣tion of our selues,1. Cor. 11. Mar. 1. 15. whether we feele these two graces,Act. 1. 38. Luk. 3. 3. Repentance and Faith:Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 3. 26. and that in∣creased in vs, or at least continued:Col. 3. 9. 10. 11. for hereby we haue put off the old man and put on the new, and so are accep∣table to the Lord through Iesus Christ. 2. The rule of our triall. We must trie our repentance by the lawe of God,Heb. 6. 1. whereof the ten Com∣maundements are the summe: and our faith by the Gospell,Mat. 1. 15. whereof the Ar∣ticles
of our faith containe a short summe also. 3. The Subiect of our triall or parts to be examined, We must examine our selues, and that for all parts.2. Cor. 13. 5. 1.1 Thes 5. 23. Our minde whether it be inlight∣ned to know that which is good and to be imbraced,Col. 1. 9. 10 and that which is euill for to be auoyded.Heb. 5. 14. 1, Thes. 5. 21. 2. Our memory whether it do firm∣ly keepe those things that it hath lear∣ned.Psa. 119. 11. 3.Pro. 7. 1. 2. Our will whether it chuse the good and refuse the euill.Luk. 2. 51. Rom. 7. 18. 9. 20. 4. Our affections whether they loue that which god loueth, hate that which he hateth.Rom. 7. 22. 24. 5.1. Cor. 6. 20 Our body whether it indeauour to performe euery duety accordingly and in euery part,Rom. 6. 12. 19. and all this at all times and in all places.Iam. 1. 26. All these parts being the Lords,Deu. 6. 4. 5. 6▪ he doth require this holinesse in them all, and that by striuing to perfection.
Mat. 22. 37. Luk. 10. 27. 1. Thes. 5. 23. Phil. 3. 12. 13. Time of our examination. The fittest time is.Eccl. 4. 17. Ps. 26. 6. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 31. 1. In our preparation to the Saboth, to obserue it continually. 2. More carefully before our recei∣uing the sacrament or before a fast publike. priuate. Ioel. 2. 12. 13. 17. The reason is because the Lord wilbe sanctified in all them that come neere vnto him in any such speciall manner And moreouer we may certainly ex∣pect a measure from him of blessing,Leu. 10. 3, Exo. 19. 22 as we measure to him in our preparation to such holy exercises.Mat. 7. 2. Mar. 4. 24. Place for our examination. The meetest place is,Psa. 4. 4. 5. where we may bee most secret, and freest from di∣stractions, setting our selues as in the presence of GOD with whom we haue to deale, and where we may most freely powre out our soules without suspition of hypocrisie.
Helpes before our examination, to make it more powerfull. We may vse the helpe of this three∣fold consideration. 1. Of the misery into which euery sin brings vs vntill wee haue truely re∣pented of it. 2. How our sinnes are made more haynous by circumstances. 3. The blessings following a holy conuersation. The first helpe, viz. danger of impe∣nitency in any sinne. 1. By euery sin we dishonour God more or lesse, according to the quality thereof, and so prouoke him to disho∣nour vs againe. 1. Sam. 2. 30. 2. Euery sinne defaceth in some sort the Image of God in vs, which we should labour to repaire dayly. This i∣mage is the holinesse commanded in the whole law. Col. 3. 9. 10. 3. Each makes vs in part like Sathan, whom in that sin we resemble,John. 44. giuing him aduantage thereby both to accuse
vs before the Lord,1. Ioh. 5. 18 and to lay speciall claime to vs for the same,Iob. 1. 9. 10 11. 12. or at least to get liberty to afflict vs thereupon. 4. Each as a cloud separates betwene the Lords mercy and vs,Esa. 59. 2. hides from vs the comfortable light of his counte∣nance,Ios. 24. 19. 20. hindreth the course of his gra∣ces,Ier. 5. 25. for our God is so holy,Psa. 5. 4. 5. that no euill can dwell with him, and so turnes away blessings temporall and spirituall. 5. Prouokes the anger of our most lo∣uing father against vs, as the faults of children do of their parents. 1. Cor. 10 22. Exod. 4. 14. 24. Ioh. 22. 17. 18. 6. Brings distrust of Gods proui∣dence,Psal. 50. 16. 17. 18. and weakeneth our faith in all his promises by the same example of a lewd child cōtinuing obstinate against the parents in any fault,Esa. 1. 12. 13. to 17. 66. 3. so that wee cannot say that God is our God, or that we are his dutifull people and chil∣dren, and in his fauour so long as wee continue therein. The triall of this in our most serious prayers in time of trouble is most euident.
7. Brings temporall scourges on our bodies,Exo. 4. 24. 26. goods, friends or name, wherby the Lord sheweth his hatred of euery sin euen in his owne children,1. Cor. 11. 30. 31. awaken∣eth them,Num. 27. 12. 13. 14. &. 20. 12. 24. that they may not be con∣demned with the world, preuents the like in themselues and others, as Dauids ensample fully declareth. 8. Greiues Gods spirit to cause it to depart so farre,Eph. 4. 30. as that we shall loose al sound feeling of any true comfort in Christ,1. Thes. 5. 19. be made vnable to pray,Ps. 95. 8. 9. 51. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. heare or performe any spirituall duty aright, & contrarily become hard hearted without all sense of sinne or Gods An∣ger for it, to cost vs many a sorrowfull heart before wee recouer it againe: to teach vs to know Gods holinesse and our owne vilenesse,Cant. 5. 2. 3. 6. 7. and so to be made more watchfull after to keepe and stir vp the spirit, to make more account of it and giue it better intertainement. 9. Brings a wounded conscience,Pro. 18. 14. the greatest plague of all other, for the con∣science will keepe a remembrance,
though it sleepe vntill God awake it, and call it to an account,Gen 4 7. and then will follow. 1. Shame to make vs run from God as Adam.Gen. 3. 8. 2. Sadnesse as in Naball. 3. Terrible feare, as in Bellchazzar. 4. Dispaire as in Cain, Saul, Iudas, Ac∣hitophel. 5. A hell in our consciences that wee shall be as the raging sea,Esa. 57. 20 21. casting out our owne shame, the worme of consci∣ence beginning to gnaw without hope of release or any ease, vnlesse all this be preuented by speedy and vnfained repentance in this life, which we know not whether it shall be continued vnto the morning.Luk. 12. 20. 10. Barreth vs out of heauen & de∣priueth vs vtterly of all the ioyes there∣of.Mat. 5. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 9 10. 11. 11. Thrusts vs into hell to abide the torment therof with Sathan & his An∣gells for euermore. Apo. 21. 8. Gal. 3. 10 Rom. 6. 23. Deut. 27. 26. Gen. 2. 17.
The second helpe, viz. by considering the circumstances whereby our sinnes are made so sinfull. 1. The terrible maiesty of the glori∣ous God against whome the sinne is committed, declared euidently in the punishment of the Angells, Adam, the olde world, Sodome, at the giuing of the Law on mount Sinay,2. Thes. 1. 7 8. 9. 10. and to be re∣uealed more fearfully, when Christ shal come with thousand thousands of glo∣rious Angells to take an accoūt for the keeping thereof, in flaming fire to ren∣der vengeance to all who know not God, being disobedient to the gospell of Christ. 2. Because our sinnes haue bin com∣mitted against his mercies bestowed vpon vs, both ordinary and extraordi∣nary. 2. Sam. 12. 7. 8. 3. Against the checks of our consci∣ences which haue bin conuinced for the same. Ioh. 15. 22. 24. Rom. 1. 18. 21. 4. Against our high calling. 1. Thes. 2. 12. and 4. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 15.
5. Against our couenants at baptisme, our vowes oft renued, with many holy motions and purposes. Ezech. 16. 4. 6. 8 Eccle. 5. 3. 4. 5. 6. Against threats, and examples of Gods Iudgements and his fatherly chastisements. Dan. 5. 18. 22. 23. 24. 7. By committing the same sinnes oft after our repentance & pardon ob∣tained. 2. Pet. 2. 22. The third helpe, viz. by considering the blessings following a holy con∣uersation. As, 1. The escaping of all the former misery of sin. Deut. 6. 24 25. 2. We shall honour God and adorne his Gospell and so be honoured of him againe. Tit. 2. 10. 3. We shall repaire his image dayly, to cause him to delight in vs. Eph. 4. 23 24. Col. 3. 10. 4. We shall get more assurance of his fauour,Psa. 34. 10. 18. 37. 24. 25. fatherly protection and pro∣uidence for all benefits, so farre as may
stand with his owne glory, our salua∣tion and the good of his Church. 5. We shall obtaine boldnesse and power in prayer. Pro. 28. 1. Psal. 4. 3. 6. We shall escape many scourges Heb. 12. 5. Ap. 3. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 30. 31. 32 7. We shall stirr vp and reioyce the spirit of God in vs, and so get an in∣crease of al graces: for to him that hath shall be giuen and he shall haue abun∣dance. Math 25. 29. 8. We shall dismaie and driue away Sathan, with all temptations and accu∣sations. Mat. 4. 11. Iames. 4. 7. 9. We shall stop the mouthes of all the wicked when wee may beare their reproche as a crowne, and so haue boldnesse in the day of tryall to stand forth for any good cause. Iob. 31. 35. 36 10. We shall get and keepe a good conscience,Pro. 15. 15. which is a continuall feast,Rō. 14. 17. euen the beginning of the Kingdome of Heauen in peace and ioy in the holy Ghost,Psa 91. 11 & 34. 7. with assurāce of the gard of the Angells, and all other blessings there∣unto
belonging. Mat. 11. 29. 30. 11. We shal escape the lake and tor∣ment which all the foolish, that is, all impenitent sinners must indure for e∣uermore. Apo. 21. 8. 12. We shall obtaine the crowne & kingdome layd vp for all those who thus walke with God,2. Tim. 4. 7. 8. 1. Cor. 2. 9. euen the ioyes which neuer eye saw,Mat 6. 1. 4. 6. 18. & 10. 42. nor neuer eare heard, nor entred into mans heart for to consider of, with a certaine rewarde of euery good duty that euer we per∣formed. 13. And so hauing the full assu∣rance of all the promises for the life present,1: Tim. 4. 8 and that to come, we shall be a∣ble to waite continually, for the appea∣ring of our Lord and sauiour, crying alwayes, come Lord Iesu, Come quick∣ly. Apoc. 22. 20. Some other rules to be obserued for our di∣rection & comfort in our examinatiō. 1. That we examine for sinnes. 1. past. 2. present. 3. Which we are in danger of.
2. Concerning sinnes past,Psal. 25. 7. & 51. 1. 2. 17. whether wee haue so vnfainedly repented of them, that the very remembrance of them is grieuous vnto vs. 3. A contrite heart after euery of∣fence,Psalm. 51. 4. 17. because we haue therein offen∣ded our louing God, with a liuely ha∣tred of the same, and a resolute purpose neuer to commit it againe, (looking withall at Christ,Zac. 12. 10 whom we haue pier∣ced thereby) is as much with God, for all satisfactorie punishment, as if there had beene no sinne committed; with Dauids speech (I haue sinned) is ioy∣ned the answer of the Prophet: The Lord hath put away thy sinne: but we are neuer to rest vntill wee feele our hearts so affected.2. Sā. 12. 13 4. For sinnes of which we are in danger,Ioh. 15. 7. & 16. 23. 24. because we are strongly incli∣ned to them, or otherwise, or for graces which we want, let vs beg in faith ear∣nestly, looking at Christ.Math. 77. & 21. 22. Let vs aske the ouercomming of any sinne, vsing all the meanes therevnto,1. Ioh. 5. 14 Iam. 4. 3. especially
auoyding the occasions of it, and we shall preuaile by little and little, vntill we attaine a perfect conquest,Mat. 5. 6. & 15. 22. 25. 27. 28. thorow the victory of Iesus Christ,Ioh. 7. 38. so for any grace or an increase thereof,Psal. 10. 17. & 145. 18. 19. let vs im∣portune the Lord after the same man∣ner,Rom. 8. 26 and we shall obtaine the graces,Dan. 6. 10. for such a begging is the grace wee craue,Exo. 29. 38. 39. In 1. Acceptance. 2. Beginning or first fruites. 3. Pledge of perfection. 5. Our begging must be by solemne prayer vpon our knees,Psa. 25. 1. & 123. 1. 2. 3. morning and euening at least,1. Thes. 5. 17. with giuing speciall thankes for that measure of grace we haue attained vnto, and by the earnest lifting vp of our hearts continually. 6. We must beware that we neither trust so much to our praiers,Mat. 4. 7. as to cause vs to neglect any other meanes ordai∣ned of God for whatsoeuer we desire, but that we vse them all still more cons∣cionably, especially the principall,Psal. 127. 1. 2. as the word preached, and all other in
order, neyther that wee trust so much to the other meanes as to neglect prayer. 7. So many sinnes as we haue ouer∣come of conscience and loue to God, or graces as we haue thus attained to or can pray earnestly for,Gal. 5. 22. 23. 24. so many liue∣ly euidences we haue of the sanctifying spirit of God,Rom. 6. 5. and of our sound rege∣neration so long as we lye not in any one knowne sin: and as wee growe herein,Rom. 6. 12. 14. so grow we in assurance before God. 8. In all these God accepts our in∣deuour to obey, as perfect obedience, so that it be totall in euery part,Neh. 1. 11. viz. in our minde,Mat. 17. 20. conscience, will and affecti∣ons,Act. 11. 23. and also earnest to do what we can without hypocrisie,Esa. 42. 3. as he did Abra∣hams resolution to offer Isaack,Gen. 22. 16 17. and as the kind father accepts the indeauour of the child,Mal. 3. 17. or as it is in almes,2. Cor. 8. 12 where a man is accepted according to that which he hath,1. Ion. Iam. 4. 3 and not according to that which he hath not: so that there
be first a willing minde,Mat. 5. 6. so is it in all graces if there bee a strife with hun∣gring after more vntill we come to a perfect man,Eph. 4. 13. 14. euen the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ. 9. Gods grace is sufficient for vs. To 1. Supply that which is wanting. 2. Forgiue that which is cōmit∣ted. 3. Impute Christs obedience.2. Cor. 12. 9. 4. Support our weaknesse. 5. Restore and raise vs vp being fallen. 10 Gods power is made perfect,2. Cor. 12. 9 or manifest thorough our weakenesse that God may bee glorified and wee humbled continually, that hee that re∣ioyceth may reioyce in the Lord. 1. Cor. 1. 31. 11. In greater measure of graces as we get more assurance, so we must returne more thankefulnesse, & become more humbled, watching against pride,1. Thes. 5. 18. for feare of the messenger of Sathan to buffet vs: for pride springs vp,2. Cor. 12. 7 when
all other sinnes dye. 12 In lesse measure we are to mourne after an increase by the carefull vse of all the meanes,Mat. 5. 6. for more assurance and comfort,1. Thes. 4. 1. 10. least wee deceiue both our owne selues & others, hauing nothing but a shew, being as the foolish Vir∣gins, and as the barren Fig-tree. Math. 25. 2. 3. Luc. 13. 7. The Glasse of the Law, or Map of the narrow way of life, thorow euery comman∣dement, whereby we beholding our owne naturall misery, may be driuen dayly to put on Christ, and considering our wayes, may turne our feete to the testi∣monies of the Lord. IN all this view, we must euer remem∣ber to be thankfull for euery grace receiued, mourne for euery sinne com∣mitted, looking at Christ crucified, begging pardon thorow him, and the imputation of his obedience: In all wants we are to intreat an increase of
strength and grace thorow him,Pro. 4. 18 by lif∣ting vp our hearts vntill we attaine to perfection,Eph. 4. 13 14. obseruing how we grow in grace dayly and in subduing of euery sin. 2. Pet. 3. 17. This is the way, walke in it. Esa. 30. 21. Lord open thou mine eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy law. Psa. 119. 18. 1. Commaundement. Thou shalt haue no other Gods before me. Which inioynes vs to haue Iehoua onely for our God, and commands the parts of his inward worship. Here we are to examine how we walke foreward more cherfully in these principal duties, which are the very entrances to all true godlinesse. 1. Knowledge of God,Pro. 6. 22. 23. and of his will re∣uealed in his word] which is a princi∣pal part of the image of god,Col. 1. 10. 3. 10. wherof we may glory,Phi. 1. 9. 10 & without which we must needes perish,Ier. 9. 23. 24. being vnable to go one steppe towards the Kingdome of hea∣uen. Hos. 4. 6.
2. Faith] Whereby we beleeue God to be our God, & withal euery part of his word, so as we feele the power of it in our hearts. as of 1. Commaundements, to obey them readily, as Noah and Abraham. 2. Iudgements and threats, to terrifie vs from sin as the Niniuites. 3. Promises to comfort vs, & incou∣rage vs to go on more cheerefully in godlinesse,Heb. 11. 2. 6 as Abraham & al the fathers who receiued good report hereby. Without this it is impossible to please God. Rom. 14. 23. 3. Confidence in Gods prouidence] to be able to cast our burden onely vp∣on God,Psa. 55. 22. reioycing in him alwayes,Phil. 4 4. that he is our God:Psa. 3. 6. full of Christian courage as Dauid, Nehemiah, Daniel. Neh. 6. 10 Dan. 6. 10. 4 Patience with cheerefulnesse in the middest of all our trialls, euen then when God seemerh to haue forgot∣ten vs,Rom. 8. 28. or to frowne vpon vs,Gen. 50. 20 hauing our eye still at him, and howe he dis∣poseth
all for our comfort in the ende: thus wayting for the happye issue,Iob 13. 15. saying with Iob,Heb. 13. 5. though hee kill mee I will trust in him, and prooue my wayes in his sight, knowing assured∣ly that he cannot forsake, faile, or for∣get vs. 5. Loue of his Maiesty because of his goodnesse, louing feruently all his commaundements, ordinances and seruants with whatsoeuer he loueth, & that for his cause onely, zealous therein to promote his honour, hating that which he hateth with a vehement in∣dignation, as our Sauiour and Dauid. Psal. 69. 9. 17. 6. Child-like-feare] liuing alwayes as in Gods presence,Psal. 16. 8. labouring to ap∣proue our hearts vnto him,Gen. 5. 24. thus wal∣king with him as Enoch vntill he take vs hence: not fearing the faces of men, but as the three children and Nehemiah. Nehem. 6. 10. 11. 12. 13: 14. Dan. 3. 17. 18. 7. Humility] because of his excellency
and our vildnesse, his holinesse and our sinfulnesse,1. Pet. 5. 5. 1. Cor. 4. 7. so giuing all the glory of all our good things to him alone,Psal. 131. 1. 2. as the free gifts of his rich mercy, acknow∣ledging withall,Iam. 1. 17. that we are not worthy the least of them,1. Cor. 1. 26. 31. as Iacob and Daniel, mourning withall for all the horrible sinnes of our time,Dan. 9. 3. 4. as iust Lot,2. Pet. 2. 7. 8 and the mourners in Ierusalem before the cap∣tiuity. Ezech 9. 4. Abhorring contrarily all the breaches of this commaundement; as the mother sins, of all the fearefull abhominations that are committed in the world. 1. Atheisme] whereby most liue, as if there were no God, or heauen, Iudge∣ment or place of torment, as those fooles that say in their hearts, there is no God, Psal. 14. 1. 2. Ignorance] or spirituall blindnesse,Hos. 4. 6. whereby multitudes perish liuing with∣out Christ and without GOD in the world,Eph. 2. 12. and so go hudwincked to hell,Esa. 1. 3. as the Gentles; worse then the Oxe
that knoweth his owner. 3. Infidelity] whereby the greatest part neither regard the word or works of God, nor yet depend vppon him, shewed euidently by these signes. 1. Prophanesse of life. 2. Contempt of Gods word. 3. Impacience and fainting in trialls. 4. Tempting God by vsing vnlaw∣full meanes in stead of wayting his lea∣sure.2. Kin. 6. 33 7. 2. 5. dispayre of his mercy. 4. Carnall confidence] trusting in vani∣ty, euen in any thing but God, whether In 1. Wit and policie. 2. Power and strength. 3. Wealth. 4. Friendes, fauour or any other meanes, for hereby we withdrawe our hearts from God,Ier. 17. 5. bring a curse vppon our selues making these our Gods. 5. Coldnes] or lukewarmnesse in the loue of God his trueth and seruants as the Laodicean,Apo. 3. 15. 16. or decaying in our first loue, as the church of Ephesus. Apo. 2. 4. 5
6. Louing or delighting in any thing aboue God, his word and ordinances, or preferring them before God and his fauour, as— 1. Parents, children, or friend, as E∣lie. 2. Pleasures, as Esau. 3. Pompe and wealth of the world, as the yong man comming to Christ.Mar. 20. 21 22. 4. Our selues, whereunto Peter per∣swaded our Sauiour. Mat. 16 22. 7. Hatred of God] appearing in ma∣lice against his word,Rom. 1. 30 or seruants for doing his commandements,Exo. 20. 5. as in Cain, Ahab. Deut. 7. 10. 8. Wilfull disobedience] against the light of our consciences, as in Saul, which is rebellion, and as the sinne of witchcraft. 1. Sam. 15. 22. 23. 9. Timorousnes] fearing men more then God,Apo. 21. 8. and therupon doing, or for∣bearing good or euill, for feare of men only, which is Idolatrie, making Gods of men. 10. Presumption] vpon his mercy to
sinne because hee is mercifull,Rom. 2. 4. 5 as most hypocrites doe, though hee haue sayd plainly hee will not bee mercifull vnto such. Deut. 29. 19. 20. 21. 11. Pride against God] setting our selues against his word, iudgements or ser∣uants with an high hand,1. Pet. 5. 5 as Pharao: or taking his praise to our selues as Herod, not considering our owne weaknes, as Peter. Luke. 5. 8. 12. Hauing other Gods] whether the Pope of Rome, as all the Papists reuerence his word, and ordinances a∣boue Gods:Rō. 10. 14. or any of the Saints, whom they inuocate,Phil. 3. 19. or our bellies, or Mam∣mon. Mat. 6. 24. 2. Commaundement, Thou shalt make thee no grauen image &c. Which commaundeth Gods outward worship with all the parts and meanes thereof, that wee worshippe him onely according to his will reuealed in his word.
Here we are to examine how we walke on more conscionably. 1. In a more carefull vse of all the or∣dinary meanes of holinesse, and parts of Gods seruice, as frequenting the word preached, which is the ordinary meanes to beget faith, and the princi∣pal to increase it, reading or hea∣ring some part of it read dayly, medi∣tation, conference, the vse of good bookes, company of the godly, practise of the duetyes of piety,Exo. 29. 38. 39. omitting no o∣portunity nor part thereof priuately nor publikely,Dan. 6. 10. prayer duly morning & euening at least: in the most humble manner, as the perpetuall morning and euening sacrifice vnder the law. 2. Vsing the helpes ordained to bind and stirre vp our selues hereunto, as 1. Vowes of things in our owne po∣wer,Esa. 22. 12. 13. as Iacob. 2. Fasting when God calls vs there∣vnto,Ezr. 8. 21. 22. & 10. 6. 9. by some iudgement already vpon vs, or threatned, or for obtaining some
speciall blessing. Act. 13. 2. 1. Cor. 7. 5. 3. Striuing for the maintainance of the faith,Iud. 3. that is of Gods pure worship and trueth, without any mixture of mans inuentions or of any other cor∣ruptions. 1. Tim. 6. 14. Abhorring all breaches of this commandement. 1. Imagery of the true God & Christ, or of fained Gods, Saints or Angells for any religious vse, as Crucifixes and the like. Deu. 27. 15. 2. Euery outward representation, de∣uised by a man, to be eyther a part of Gods worship or to teach some religi∣ous duety: for all such likenesses are expresly condemned. Nor the like∣nesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue. &c. 3. All will-worship] that is all not warranted by the word of God though done in neuer so good an intent, as in Nadab and Saul,Deu. 12. 32 for Christ is the one∣ly teacher of his Church,Mat. 7. 7. 8. 9. and sole or∣dainer
of the meanes of his owne wor∣ship. Luke 12. 1. 2. 1. Sam. 15. 15. Mat. 23. 10. 4. All approbation of any idolatrie, su∣perstition, or false worship 1. Presence.1. Th. 4. 22. 2 Speech.Rom. 1. 31. 3.

Worshipping Sathan,Apo. 21. 8. by seeking to effect strange matters by meanes
forbidden, or not warranted: For Sathā is very readie, when any homage is done vnto him by practising such meanes, as to Saul seeking the witch when he was forsaken of God, and to sorcerers, as we see by daily experiēce. 8. Hipocriticall worship] as 1. Outward ceremonies, or bare shewes of religion.Mat. 23. 23▪ 25. 2. Forwardnesse in small matters, o∣mitting the most waightie,1. King. 18▪ 21. as the Pharisies. 3. Halting between two religions. 9. Neglecting the seruice of God or any part or meanes thereof. 3. Commaundement, Thou shalt not take the name of &c.] ordayning the right manner of perfor∣ming Gods worshippe. Here we are to vewe how we run on more cherefully in these duties. 1. A reuerēt vse of al the names of God, as 1. Titles, as God, Lord.Deu. 28. 58 2. Attributs, as mercy, Truth. 3. Ordinances, as worde, sacraments,

to his dishonour. Leu. 24. 11. 14. 16. 4. Cursing] for God hath giuen vs tongues to blesse with, and said, blesse and curse not. Iames. 3. 9. 10. Rom. 12. 14. 5. Abusing Gods Religion] as his word, sacraments or other ordinances (whereby hee most familiarly shewes himselfe and all his goodnesse to vs, & would haue vs to make profession of him) which is done not onely by neg∣lecting of any of them,Heb. 2. 3. but 1. by vsing them vnprofitably with∣out reformation of life,2.

Here we are to consider well how we grow in a conscionable pract∣ise of all the dueties of the Sabboth. I. Before the assemblies, 1. Remembring the Sabboath before it come, that we may dispatch all our owne workes in the six dayes,Esa. 56. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7. to attend the right sanctification thereof, accor∣ding to the caueat Remember: so to consecrate it as a glorious day vnto the Lord, to honour him, not doing our owne wayes,Esa. 58. 13. 14. nor seeking our own wil, nor speaking a vaine word. 2.

How we preuaile in rooting out of our hearts that bitter roote of 1. Couetousnesse] whereby we are either hindred from heauenly duties,1. Tim. 6. 9. 10. or from feeling the sweetnes that is in godlines, or from depending vppon Gods prouidence: or are drawne im∣moderately after the loue of the world, as to seeke to get by vnlawfull meanes, or to vex and disquiet our hearts with carking cares.1. Tim. 6. 10. 4. How we grow in our detestation of all kinds of thefts proceeding from couetousnesse. 1. Thefts in the Church. 1. Simony] buying or selling the guifts of the holy Ghost,Acts 8. 18. 20. whether Church of∣fices, or places to exercise those offi∣ces in, or the goods of the Church to
the hindrance thereof, or to our owne priuate gaine. 2. Sacrilege] conueving to our selues,Ios. 6. 8. 19. or detayning things dewe to God,Mal. 3. 8. 9. 10. whereby he is robbed of his ho∣nour, or the saluation of his people hin∣dered, as by al sorts of vnconscionable ministers, and all others keeping away Church liuings, without dewe regarde of the peoples saluation, and Gods worshippe. 3. Gaine by things hindring the gos∣pell, and true pietie, or furthering super∣stition: as Demetrius the siluer∣smith. Acts. 19. 24. 2. Thefts in ciuill dealings. 1. Counterfeit or coloured deceipt by faire wordes, or the like, as in Amos dayes. Amos. 8. 4. 5. 6. 2. False scales, waights, or measures, all which God abhorreth. Deut. 25. 13. 14. 15. 3. Racking the prices of things, to the oppression of the poore, or euill ensample of others: thus did the gy∣gyants
before the floud, that the earth was full of crueltie:Mic. 2. 1, 2, 3. and the great men before the captiuitie,Gē. 6. 4. 11. for which God threatned to plague them with other spoylers,Esa. 5. 7. 8. as it came to passe: This cau∣seth the poore to sigh, whom God will auenge. Exod. 22. 23. Deut. 15. 9. 10. 11. 4. Ingrossing] getting vp all commo∣dities to sell as men list, euen the the ve∣rie refuse. This is to swallow vppe the poore, a sinne which the Lord will not forget. Am 8. 4, 5. 6. 7. 8. 5. Sale vpon day] to the hurt of the buyer:1. The. 4. 6. that is, inhauncing the price, onely in consideration of longer time of payment, more then the buyers are able to make of it, which is vsury or worse. 6. Becomming bankrupt, to inrich our selues by the spoyles or goods of o∣thers, which is flat cosinage and theft. 1. Thes. 4. 6. 3. Thefts in lending. 1. Vsury] as when men exact a gaine
by couenant, aboue the principall lent, onely in lieu and recompence of the lending,Exo. 22. 14. 15. which is biting ordinarily, for it is very rare when one or other is not bitten by it.Psa. 15. 5. All vsurie is of this sorte wherein charitie is broken towards a∣ny one.Neh. 5. 7. 8 9. 10. 4. Thefts in withholding. 1. The pledge. Ezek. 18. 7. 2. That which hath been commit∣ted to vs in trust for others, as the hus∣bandmen the vineyard. Mat. 21. 41. Pro. 3. 28. 3. Our debt] which is a marke of an vngodly man; for the godly should owe nothing but loue, and that to eue∣ry one. Psal. 37. 21. Rom. 13. 8. 4. The hirelings wages] a sinne cry∣ing for vengeance. Iam. 5. 4. Ier. 22. 13. 14. 5. Thinges found] if wee can know the owner. Leu. 6. 23. Deut. 12. 1. 6. That which we haue vniustly got∣ten from others, and not making resti∣tution thereof with the better, if wee be
able. as Zachaeus.Phil. 4. 8. Leu. 6. 1. ad 8. Luke 19. 8. 5. Theftes, whereby we rob our selues and those who depend vpon vs, disabling vs to performe the duties which wee owe to them and others. 1. Vnthriftines] not regarding to saue that which God hath giuen, but wast∣ing without reason or regard, vppon lewde companions, or vaine delights, as the prodigall sonne. Luk. 15. 13. 2,Eph. 4. 28. Liuing inordinately] without pain∣fulnes in our calling; the Pismire shall condemne such vnprofitable seruants. Prou. 6. 6. 3. Rash suretishippe] without regard of the circumstances, so oft forbidden by the wise Salomon. Pro. 17. 18. 6. Other ordinarie thefts, in getting goods by vnlawfull meanes. 1. Remouing our neighbours markes,
or bounds, to inlarge our owne, which is accursed. Deu. 27, 17. 2. Vncharitable inclosure] to the hurt of the common wealth, or of any one, without sufficiēt satisfactiō, for which the Lord threatneth a wo. Esa. 5. 8. 3. Peruerting the law, or corrupting iudgement, by bribes, friendship or craft, to wring the poore, as Iezabell did Naboth for his vineyard. 4. Man-stealing] viz. stealing away or inticing children or seruants, a farre worse theft then stealing any goodes inasmuch as these are more precious. 1 Tim. 1. 9. 10. 5. Practise of vnlawfull arts] as such as haue no warrant by the lawe of God or nature, as magicke, coniuring, playing the wiseman, for no such ought to be found amongst Gods peo∣ple, being abhominable to the Lord. Deu. 18. 9. 10. 11. 12. 6. Gaming] for more then we may cōueniently spend, or could be cōtent to giue, especially at vnlawfull games,
or vnfit times,Phil. 4. 8. or falsely. A matter of badde report, to the hurt of our selues, or our neighbour or both, accompani∣ed commonly with many disorders, brawles, grudges, couetousnesse, oaths fraud, and the like. 7. Falsifiyng the will of the dead] a sin against the Lawe of nature. Gal. 3. 19. 8. Pilfering] the least matter or co∣sening,1. Thes. 4. 6 for God is the auenger of all such things. 9. Conspiring] or any way fauouring or consenting to any such fact, he that doth this hateth his owne soule. Pro. 29. 24. 9. Command. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse a∣gainst thy neighbour] inioyning vs to seeke all means to maintaine our own good name and our neighbours. 1. For our owne good name wee are to examine how we grow.
1. Seeking a good name by liuing religiously, walking in al the comman∣dements of God without reproofe,Luk. 1. 6. as Zacharie and Elizabeth,Act. 10. 1 Cornelius,Act. 16. 1. 2. Ti∣mothic a yong man:Pro. 10. 7. For the memoriall of the iust being as a pretious ointment shall bee blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rotte. Eccl. 7. 3. 2. Keeping narrow watch against euery sinne continually, because euery fault is to the godly man,Eccl. 10. 1. as the dead flie, marring the sweetest oyntment, & a litle leuen to the whole lumpe, be∣sides the malice of Sathan, and the wic∣ked to blaze vs, & blaspheme our reli∣giō for any one fault, passing by al the good things in vs, as in Dauid for Vri∣ah. 2. Sam. 12. 14. Euen this is a staine to the worthiest kings of Iuda, that yet the high places were not taken away. 3. Seeking in euery thing Gods glo∣rie alone] and not our owne more then for him, for then hee will giue vs glorie aboundātly, but seeking our own glory he will turne it into shame. 1. Sa. 2. 30.
4. Carefull to iudge and speake the best of all other, professing godlinesse] for God will cause others to measure so to vs againe.Eccl. 7. 24. Mat. 7. 2. 5. Vsing but few, and wise speech∣es] for in many wordes are much va∣nitie,Pro. 10. 19 but such speech in due time are like apples of gold, with pictures of sil∣uer. Pro. 25. 11. 6. Striuing to cheerefulnesse and af∣fability in all our speeches, as our Saui∣our. Matth. 11. 17. 19. 7 Indeuoring to be sincere in word and deed, abhorring dissembling; so we shall haue the commendation of Na∣thaniel euen of the wicked, at least in their heartes, to be right Christians in whome is no guile, Ioh. 1. 47. 2. Concerning our Christian neigh∣bours good name, whereby God is glorified. 1. Reioycing at it, as Iohn for the e∣lect Ladie and her children. 2. Ioh. 1. 4. 2. Defending their credit by pub∣like
or priuate testimony according to our perswasion of them, as our Saui∣our did of Iohn and of his owne disci∣ples, they againe giuing testimony to him. Mat. 11. 2. 7. 3. Gladly acknowledging all the gifts of God in them, as our Sauiour of the 7. Churches, and Paul of the Chri∣stians, to whom he writ. 4. Couering their faulty so much as we may without sin, as Shem and Ia∣phet their fathers nakednes, for which they are blessed, yet not approuing of the least of their sinnes, but seeking priuately in all loue the reformation of them Eph. 5. 11. 5. Readily receiuing euery good re∣port of them, for that is the nature of true loue,Act. 16. 3. yet not committing our selues ouer hastely vnto them,1. Cor. 13. 7. vntill suffici∣ent triall,Ioh. 2. 24 as our Sauiour. 6. Expounding each doubtfull matter in the better part, if there be any pro∣bability thereof, as Iacob the death of Ioseph and his dreames, for loue thin∣keth
not euill. 1. Cor. 13. 7. 7. Shewing a dislike to whisperers and talebearers, which wil driue away the slaundering tongue. Psa. 15. 3. Pro. 25. 23. 8. Vsing all good meanes for the mainteinance of the good name of e∣uery one professing the feare of God, by admonishing, exhorting, or direct∣ing them in loue and wisdome by our selues and others. Abhorring these contrary vices. 1. Enuie at the worthy credit of any, as the pharisyes against our Saui∣our. 2. Euill suspition without euident cause, as the Barbarians against Paul. Act. 28. 4. 3. Itching eares to heare our owne commendations with the discredit of others, or at least to be flattered, as A∣hab by the false prophets. 4. Speeches sauouring of malice or disdaine at the credit of others, as
Corah and the Pharisies. 5 Boasting] seeking our owne glo∣ry, though with the disparagement of others, as the proud Pharisie. 6. Vncharitable iudgeing of o∣thers for some slipps, infirmities, euill reports, crosses, or some other acci∣dent, as Hely of Hanna, Iobs friendes of him, to be an hypocrite, & much more to iudge so for good things, or such as may be well taken, as the Pharisies of our Sauiour eating with the Publicans. 7. Aggrauating small faults or slaū∣ders, without care to couer or amend them. 8. Reporting mens bare wordes or actions without their intent and mea∣ning, wresting or any way peruerting them, as the false witnesses against our Sauiour, Iewes against Stephen. 9. Bearing false witnesse] or accu∣sing falsely, as Haman against the Iewes, Amazia against Amos: as also the accusations,Amo 7. 10 against our Sauiour, Ie∣remie, Paul.
10. Lying] which is very falshood in word or deede with purpose to de∣ceiue. This is a principall sinne of Sathan,Ioh. 8. 44. who was a lier from the begin∣ning, and the father thereof. 11. Vniust or rash arbitrement or giuing iudgement, as the Elders against Naboth. 12. Malicious accusations, not of a∣ny conscience to God, or for amend∣ment of the partie, or good of others, but of spite, as Doeg. 13. Betraying others, or their cause, craftily vnder pretence of friendshippe or otherwise: as the Herodians inten∣ded, and Iudas delt with our Sauiour. 14. Bewraying the secret or infirmi∣tie of our neighbour to his discredit, which wee might well haue concealed. Mat. 18. 15. 15. Lightly beleeuing flying tales or suspitions,Psa. 15. 3. against our brother, as Saul against Dauid, and the Priestes, much more spreading them, or adding to them.
16. Flattering] as Corah and his com∣pany did the people; and as Absolon or the false Prophets crying peace, which is to lay nets for men, and to be huntsmen for Sathan. 10. Com. Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house] wherein the Lord requires our very hearts to be vpright towards our neighbour. Here we must examine our hearts how we grow. 1. In intertaining only holy thoughts, purposes and affections for the good of all men.1. Th. 5. 23 2. In suppressing euill thoughts and motions,Zach. 7. 10. that we may neuer giue any consent,Rō. 7. 7. 20 23. 24. nor take the least delight in thē, but labour to the vtter burying of all concupiscence, vntill we be perfect in the heauens.
The glasse of the Gospell, or the examina∣tion of our faith, according to the Ar∣ticles of faith, which containe the summe of the Gospell. Rules. 1. THe measure of our faith is ac∣cording to the measure of the power therof in comfort and sanctifi∣cation,1. Cor. 4. 20 issuing from euery article,2. Tim. 3. 5. ex∣cept in the time of temptation.2. Cor. 1. 22 2. All the benefits contayned in the articles of faith,2. Cor. 1. 20 are ours, in & through Christ onely, when he is ours. 3. Let vs proue our selues therefore whether we are in the faith, let vs ex∣amine our selues;2. Cor. 1 3. 5 knowe wee not our owne selues, how that Iesus Christ is in vs, except we be reprobates. 4. And if Christ be in vs,Rom. . 10. the body is dead because of sinne, but the spirit is life for righteousnesse sake. 5. For the Kingdome of God is not in word but in power.1. Cor. 4. 20 6. We must therefore shew our faith out of our workes: for as the bodye
without the spirit is dead, euen so faith without works is dead. I am. 2. 18. 20. 26. 1. Article. I beleeue in God] 1. This is my faith, that though by nature thorough Adam, I & the whole Church are Apostates from God,Eph. 2. 13. and enemies to him & his law, yet by grace thorough the secōd Adam Iesus Christ, God is our God, and we his people re∣conciled vnto him,Heb. 8. 3. to serue him in new∣nesse of life all our dayes.Luk. 1. 74 75. 2. This is my comfort hereof, that God is my God, and hath sealed mee for himselfe,Ioh. 20. 28. 29. and therefore I am most blessed, being in such a case. Psal. 144. 15. 3. This giues mee further assurance that this my faith is sound, because to∣gether with this comfort, he hath giuē me since I beleeued in his name a heart desirous to depart from all iniquity. 2. Tim. 2. 29. Father]
1. This is my faith,Gal. 3. 22. 26. that though I was a child of wrath, yet by grace in Christ I am the child of God,Ier. 4. 19. and God my louing father. 2. This comfort I receiue hereof, that I being thus his child shall lacke no∣thing, because my heauenly father doth tender me much more,Mal. 3. 17. then any earthly father his child. Esay. 46. 15. 16. 3. This is my assurance, that my faith herein is sincere,Mal. 1. 6. because together with this comfort,Mat. 12. 50. I feele my selfe af∣fectioned to reuerence,Gal. 4. 5. 6. loue and obey him as my most deare father, and am inabled by his spirit to runne to him with boldnesse in al my wants, crying Abba, oh my father. Rom. 8. 15. Almighty] This is my faith, that though I be weake and vnable to re∣sist my enimies bodilie or spirituall, no way able to helpe or prouide for my selfe, yet my heauenly father is of all maiesty and power,Mat. 8. 2. guiding continu∣ally
men, Angells,Psa. 23. 4. deuils, and all crea∣tures to serue for his owne glory, and the good of his children. 2. This comfort I receiue hereof, that he doth & will continually make all things worke togither for the best vnto mee,Rom. 8. 28. not only the holy meanes appointed thereunto,1. Cor. 3. 20 21. 22. but also myne afflictions,Acts. 4. 28. yea my greatest enimies, Sinnes and Sathan himselfe, vntill I be perfected in the Heauens. Gen. 50. 20. 3. This also doth further assure mee, that he thus works for mee: because he hath first shewed the same mighty po∣wer, quickning and raysing mee vp from the death of sin,Eph. 1. 19. 20. which he shew∣ed in raysing my Sauiour from the graue, and secondlie for that I haue sensibly felte all things thus working togither for my saluation. Maker of heauen and earth] 1. This is my faith, that though thorow Adam I had lost the right,
both of heauen and earth, and of euery creature, so as I could haue no comfort in the vse of thē, but terror as an vsur∣per, being cast forth off the earthly paradice,Gen. 3. 24. lest as an heire of the curse, yet thorough my Sauiour the second Adam,Rom. 5. 17. 18. since I truely beleued in him, I am restored to a farre better estate,Heb. 1. 2. be∣ing made in him a right heyre of all,Rom. 8. 17. neuer to be cast forth off my inheri∣tance any more. 2. This comfort I receiue hereof, that heauen is mine and all the ioyes thereof,Eph. 2. 6. and that I am set already in the heauēly places in Christ my head, who reserues the full fruition for mee. And secondly that all the creatures in heauen and in earth bee they good or bad,Iob. 5. 23. are at a league with mee,1. Cor 3. 21. 22. 23. to helpe for my good, so far as may stand with his glory, my saluation and the good of his Church. Hos. 2. 18. 3. This is also my assurance, that my faith is sincere herein, because that together with this comfort, I both
perceiue all the creatures thus ready to helpe me,Exod. 16. 25. 35. & 17. 6. especially in time of triall when ordinary meanes fayle:2. Tim 4. 5. and al∣so feele a holy care wrought in mee to vse the creatures aright, sanctifying them by the word and prayer,Eph. 2. 6. and that my affections are sette on heauenly things.Col. 3. 2. 2. Article. And in Iesus] 1. This is my faith,Psal. 51. 5. 1. & 39. 1. that though I am guiltie of innumerable sinnes both o∣riginall and actuall, euen the breach of the whole law,Rom. 3. 10. 11. 13. 19. 20. 21. 22. and euery part there∣of, and so am worthy to bee damned, and haue al the plagues of God dewe to my sinne cast vpon me,2. Tim. 2. 26. yea though I was a bondslaue to sin and Sathan, yet I beleeue that Iesus is my Sauiour,Luke. 4. 18. & hath deliuered me from al my sins, both the guilt, & satisfactory punish∣ment of them,Psal. 1. 21. as also from the power of sinne and Sathan.Iob. 1. 29. Rom. 6. 12. 14.
2. This saith is my comfort, and moreouer that all my sinnes and ene∣mies shall not hinder my saluation. Rom. 8. 39. 3. This is also for my ful assurance thereof,Luk. 1. 47. because besides that I feele my soule reioycing in God my Sauiour, & I perceiue my selfe also deliuered from the tyranny of Sathan, and power of sinne, euen of those sinnes which be∣fore led me captiue,Rom. 6. 12. so that no sinne hath any more dominion ouer mee,Rom. 7. 24. 25. that I doe serue it in the lusts thereof, and for that I am withall deliuered from the terrors of conscience for my sinne. Christ. 1. This is my faith,Dan. 9. 24. that though I was in the kingdome of darknesse & a stranger from God by my sinne, yet Christ was anoynted for me with all the gifts of the spirit to bee my media∣tour, my King.Heb. 1. 9. Priest.Psal. 45. 7. Prophet. Mat. 23. 10. Act. 3. 22. 23.Apoc. 1. 5.
2. This is my cōfort,Col 1. 13. Ioh. 10. 28. 29 30. that he being my king, hath and will fully deliuer mee from the kingdome of Satan, & giue vnto mee his heauenly kingdom.Rom. 3. 24. 25. Se∣condly being my Priest, hath first re∣cōciled mee to his father;1. Ioh 2. 1. by the sacri∣fice of himselfe,Heb. 7. 25 & 9. 24. and keepes me since in fauour, by his perpetuall intercession. Thirdly being my Prophet,Rom. 8. 34. will pro∣ceede to teach me all the will of his fa∣ther necessary to eternall life.Heb. 8 10. 11. 3. This is for my assurance hereof,Apo. 1. 6. because I feele my selfe to haue recei∣ued of the anoynting of euery one of these from Christ & the fruit of them.1. Cor. 9. 27 1. of his kingdome,1 Ioh. 3. 3. inabling me to be∣gin nor onely to subdue my synnes & euill affections, but also to rule so sar ouer my selfe, as to bring my verye thoughts and all committed vnto mee into some obedience to Christ.2. Cor. 10. 5 2. Of his Priesthood whereby I am made able to offer to the Lord my selfe,1. Pet. 2. 5 sup∣plications,Rom. 12. 1. thankes and works of mer∣cy,Heb. 13. 15 16. with all that I haue to serue him.
3, Of his Prophesy,Rō. 15. 16. making mee to growe in the knowledge of himselfe,2. Ioh. 2. 20. 27. and in care to instruct others therein.Ioh. 6. 45. His onely sonne] 1. This is my faith, that hee beeing the onely sonne of the Father by na∣ture,Ga. 4. 4. 5. 6 hath made mee a child and heire by the grace of adoption,Eph. 2. 3. who was by nature a child of wrath and perdi∣tion. 2. This comfort I finde herein,Gal. 4. 7. that to mee belongs the inheritāce of Gods sonnes.Rom. 8. 17. Gal. 47. Rom. 8. 17. 3. This also is for my assurance, for that he hath sent the spirit of his sonne into my heart, whereby I can call him father with comfort, which is my witnesse and seale. Romans. 8 16. 2. Cor 1. 22. Our Lord] 1. This is my faith,Ga. 4. 5. 6. 7 that though I was vnder the Prince of darkenesse,1. Pet. 1. 19. hauing Sathan my Lord,Ioh. 10. 29 vntill I be∣lieued
in Christ, yet since I am Christs and he is my onely Lord By 1. Purchase with his bloud. 2. Gift from his father.Ephe. 5. 32. 3. marriage cōtracted to be cōsumate at his appearing.Hos. 2. 20. 2. This is my comfort, that being thus purchased and giuen to him as a peculiar guift,Ioh. 10. 28. I shall neuer perish, and being thus contracted to Christ my Lord, the bond thereof is in such faith∣fulnesse, Hos. 2. 19. as shal neuer be dissolued, vn∣till I be brought into the bride-cham∣ber, and fully glorified. 3. This increaseth my assurance, for that together with this comfort,Apoc. 5. 9. 24. 4. I feele my selfe redeemed from the earth: viz. my earthly conuersation, & doe delight to heare the voice of my bridegroome. 3. Article. Which was conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary] 1. This is my faith: that though I was conceiued in sinne,Psal. 51. 5. and borne in
iniquitie, and so corrupted in all the parts both of my soule and body, yet that both the conception, birth and whole nature of Christ my Sauiour,Rom. 8. 2. 3 was fully sanctified by being vnited to his Godhead,Luke 1. 35. to bee imputed vnto mee. 2. This is my comfort, that my God hath giuen me this holines of his son,2. Co. 5. 21. as a robe to couer all my sinfulnes,Phil. 3. 9. and wherby I doe both presently, and shal euer stand most gloriously in Gods sight, chiefly at the great day. 3. This is my further assurance hereof, because I can mourne for this totall corruption in mee, and being humbled in the fense of it,Rom. 7. 14. 15. 18. 23. 24. am driuen daily to put on Christ by faith: and for that I feele also the newe birth in me, by a change begun in all the pow∣ers both of my bodie and soule,Rom. 7. 22. wrought by vertue hereof, since I was conceiued and borne in the Church, by the power of the holy Ghost.
4. Article. Suffered vnder Pontius Pilate: was cru∣cified] 1. This is my faith,Gal. 3. 13. that besides all the euills which my Sauiour indured for mee, in all the course of his life, he also indured that most shamefull and ac∣cursed death which I had deserued, to satisfie his fathers instice for me, & to pacifie his wrath towards mee. 2. This is my comfort hence,Gal. 3. 13. that I am deliuered from the curse of the law, he beeing thus accursed for mee, & that whatsoeuer sufferings I indure in this life, are sanctified hereby to be to me Fatherly 1. Exercises. 2. Chastisements. 3. Trialls. 4. Fulfilling of Christs af∣flictions. 5. Meanes to confirme mee to Christ my head,Rom. 5. 3 Heb. 12. 11 & 6, 7, 8. Apo. 3. 10. Col. 1. 24. Rom. 8. 29. 6. Examples to others. 3. This also warrants the soundnes
of my faith herein.Gal. 6. 14. 1. Because I feele my selfe to profit in Christianity by my afflictions and crosses.Psa. 119. 67 71. 2. I desire to take pleasure in such suffrings for Christs sake.2 Cor. 12. 20. 3. Because the old man in mee beginnes to bee crucified with Christ, Gal,Phi. 1. 29. 2. 19. 5. 24. Dead.] 1. This is my faith,1. Cor. 15 55. 56. 57. that Christ hath died for my sin and by dying hath o∣uer come death, and so taken away the sting thereof, that it cannot hurt any of those that beleeue in him. 2. This comfort I finde hereupon, that death shalbe so far off from hur∣ting mee,Phi. 1. 23. 2. Cor. 5. 1. 2. that it is already sanctified by this death of my Sauiour, to be to mee the gate of life. 3. This also increaseth my assurance that my faith is sound herein, because I finde together with this comfort, that euery sinne hath receiued his deaths wounde in me (each beginning to dye) and for that I feele a power byGal. 2. 19.
Christs death,Phil. 3. 10. to triumph against the terrors of death,Col. 3 2. waiting for it, when I haue finished my course,Phil. 1. 21. 23. wishing to bee dissolued and to bee with Christ. Rom. 7. 24. And buried] 1. This is my faith, that Christ was buried for me, both to assure me of the certaintie of his death for me, and that all my sinnes are buried in his graue, yea withall to bury sinne in mee,Rom. 6. 3. 4 and to sanctifie my graue to bee a sweete bedde for my body to rest in vntill the resurrection.Esay. 57. 2. 2. This very faith is my ioy, and moreouer that my sinnes thus buried shal neuer come into remembrance to accuse or condemne mee,Rom. 8. 34. 35. or to hinder Gods euerlasting mercy & loue from me. 3. This also furthers my assurance, for that together with this ioy, I feele many sinnes buried in me,Col. 2. 11. 12. and consu∣ming daily by the vertue of this death
and buriall of my Sauiour, especially,Rom. 7. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. the strength and delight I tooke in e∣uery sinne. He descended into hell] 1. This is my faith, that Christ suf∣fered not only in his body the punish∣ment due to my body, but in his soule also the tormēt due to my soule, which I should haue indured for euermore,Mar. 14. 33. 34. and that not onely vppon the crosse,Luke 22. 44. but also in the garden, as appeareth by his speeches, his pravers,Heb. 5. 7. his crie, his a∣gony, and bloody sweate, and so hath for me triumphed ouer hell. 2. This is my comfort, that though I stood euer in danger of eternal death for all my sinnes, yet now by my Saui∣our I am deliuered from the terrours thereof. Heb. 2. 15. 3. This is further for my assurance hereof,Ioh. 3. 14. 15. for that I haue receiued com∣fort in this onely,Num. 21.  euen then when the paines of hell haue gotten hold vpon mee for my sinnes; and because I feele
a desire to saue others also from that place of torment by leading them to this my Sauiour,Ioh. 3. 18. 36. and haue now entred the narrow way to heauen following my Sauiour therein,Mat 7. 13. 14. hauing left the broad way going to destruction. 5. Article. The third day he rose again from the dead] 1. This is my faith, that my Sauiour hath fully satisfied the iustice of his fa∣ther for my sinn, euen to the vttermost farthing,Rom. 4. 25. in that he rose againe, be∣cause any one sin of his elect not satis∣fied for had kept him in death,1. Cor. 15. 15. 56. 57. seeing he tooke vpon him to become surety for them all. 2. This is my ioye, that thorough him I am iustified and stand as righte∣ous in the sight of my God, all my sins being vtterly done away,Rom. 4. 25. and couered hereby. 3. This helpeth my assurance here∣of,
for that besides this comfort,Eph. 2. 5. 6. I feele my selfe also raysed vp to a desire of a perfect holinesse.Phil. 3. 10. Apo. 20. 5. 6. 6. Article. He ascended into heauen] 1. This is my faith, that when my Sauiour had fulfilled all things in the earth for the redeeming of his church, he went vp into heauen,Luk. 24. 51 both to prepare the way,Act. 1. 9. and also to take possession and to keepe it for mee. Ioh. 14. 2. 2. This is my ioy, that none can hin∣der mee from thence,Ioh. 17. 24 but where my Sauiour and head is, there shall I bee also. This ratifieth my assurance, for that my affections are already ascended, beeing set on things that are aboue. Col. 3. 2. And sitteth on the right hand of God the father almighty]
1. This is my faith,Mat. 28. 18 that my Sauiour hath all power giuen him ouer all sorts,Iohn. 17. 2 to giue eternall life to whom he will,Eph 4. 8. 10 and condemne the rest, sittes as King at the right hand of his Father, filling his Church with his gifts, gui∣ding it by his word and spirit, vntill he haue glorified it,Esa. 54. 10 59. 21. and subdued all his enemies,1. Cor. 15, 24. 25. conuincing them by the light of Nature his workes, 1. creatures. 2. iudgmēts. 3. mercies. word. 2. This is my comfort, that he will guide me by his word & spirit conti∣nually:Phil. 1. 6. & ouer-rule whatsoeuer Sathā or the wicked can doo against mee,1. Pet. 1. 5 to serue for my good,Esa. 8. 16 & against thēselues. 3. This is also for my further assu∣rance herein, because I feele my selfe desirous to be guided by the direction of his holye spirit speaking in the word: and moreouer,Esa. 30. 21. I heare a voyce behind mee saying; This is the way,Esa. 59. 21. walke in it, when I turne to the right hand or to the left.
7. Article. From thence hee shall come, to iudge the quicke and the dead.] 1. This is my faith,Ioh. 5. 22. that my Sauiour shal come to be the iudge of the whole world,Ro. 14. 10. to iudge euery one according to their workes.2. Cor. 5. 10 2. This is my ioy, that though I did, and doo naturally quake, so oft as I heare or thinke of the terrible iudge∣ment,Act. 24. 26 yet remembring the iudge,2. Thes. 1. 10. who hath by himselfe satisfied for all my sinnes, so taking them on himselfe, and giuen me his owne absolute righ∣teousnesse, I can cry; Come Lord le∣sus,Apo. 22. 20 come quickly, sith hee shall come to mee a most happy Sauiour, and not an angry iudge. 3. This is also for the accomplishmēt of my assurance,2. Cor. 5. 9. 20. 11. that this my faith is sincere, because besides this comfort, I labour alwaies to haue a cleare consci∣ence, that I may haue boldnesse at that day, and can perswade men, knowing
The terrour of the Lord. 8. Article. I beleeue in the holie Ghost] 1. This is my faith, that the holy Ghost is God,1. Cor. 12. 12. 13. the third person in Tri∣nity, sanctinfier and preseruer of his Church,Eph. 4. 15, 16. & 4. 4. knitting the whole church to Christ the head thereof, & euery mē∣ber one to another. 2. This is my comfort, that hee will perfect in mee this good worke of sā∣ctification vntill the appearing of Ie∣sus Christ,Phil. 1. 6. hauing already so knit mee to Christ my head, as I can neuer bee separated. 3. This assureth my heart, because I haue already receiued the first fruits of this blessed Spirit,Rom. 8. 23. 26. whereby I am in∣abled to sigh, wayting for the perfect adoption, and to pray with groanes, striuing against that corruption in me therefore it is to mee as the seale and earnest of my inheritance against the
day of glory. 2. Cor. 1. 22. 9. Article. The holy catholike Church.] 1. This is my faith, that God hath alwayes a chosen flocke,Esa. 59. 21 not onely of those who triumph already in the heauens,Rō. 11. 3. 4. but euen militant here in the earth,Mat. 28. 19 vniuersally scattered,Mar. 16. 15. all which he hath ordained to eternall life,Ioh. 4. 21. 22. 23. by his sonne Iesus Christ, to whom all his promises appertaine,Mat. 28. 29. & 10. 14. hauing these principall markes,Luk. 10. 16 a cheerefull submis∣sion to the word and sacraments out∣wardly, Act. 2. 42. 46. and holy affections inwardly according to the same,Mat. 7. 23. proceeding from this holy faith: though the num∣ber of them haue beene very small in the most florishing ages of the church, and those ordinarily of the baser sort,1. Cor. 1. 26 27. and shall scant be found when Christ shall come.Luk 18. 8. 2. This is my comfort, that GOD hath vonchsafed mee to bee one of
that little flock. Luc. 12. 32. 3. This assureth mee further hereof, because I feele in my selfe a hungring after the word and Sacraments,Ioh. 6. 27. & 10. 27. as my spirituall nourishment, and can wil∣lingly submit my selfe to be guided by the same word, for the perfecting this worke of grace begun in me. The communion of Saints.] 2. This is my faith,Rom. 8. 15. 16. 28. 30. that this whole Church hath a communion or felow∣ship together in Christ & al his bene∣fits,Eph. 4. 4. 5. & so in euery article of this faith,1. Cor. 1. 9. as in the same Sauiour,1. Iohn 1. 3. Father,2. Pet. 1. 2. pre∣seruer & sanctifier:Phil. 2. 2. and also amongst themselues,1. Pet. 1. 10. being affected alike both inwardly in loue,Act. 2. 44. 45. 46. & 4. 32. hatred, ioy, griefe, that is, to loue the same things, and for the same: and outwardly in relie∣uing, helping, and caring for one an∣other. 2. This reioyceth my soule, that the Lord hath vouchsafed mee to bee of this blessed communion.
3. This further assureth me hereof, because together with this comfort, I am so affected to all the true seruants of God,1. Cor. 12. 26. thus soundly professing the Gospell,Ro. 12. 15. that I can pray hartily for them,Mat. 12. 49. 50. mourne and reioyce with them, and for them, as for my brethren and sisters, and bereadie to helpe them in whatsoeuer, esteeming of them as members of Christ with mee, and can clayme the word as my portion and heritage for euer. Psal, 119. 111. 10. Article. The forgiuenesse of sinnes] 1. This is my faith,Heb. 8. 10. 11. 12. that all this whole church & euery member there∣of, Apo. 7. 14. haue all their sinnes forgiuen for Christ, being all washed in his blood. 2. This comfort I finde hereof, that howsoeuer I am a miserable sinner many wayes, yet none of all my sinnes shall euer be imputed vnto mee, being of this holy Communion. Rom. 8. 33.
3. This is also for my assurance,Zac. 12. 10 be∣cause I can oft mourne bitterly,Mat. 5. 11. when I looke at my Sauiour,Rom. 7. 20. whom by my sinnes I haue crucified,Mat. 6. 14. & 5. 44. 45 and do abhor them as none of mine, but fruits of that sin that still dwelleth in mee in part, and moreouer because I can forgiue and pray euen for my very enimies, & haue set my selfe to wage continuall war against euery sin. 11. Article. The resurrection of the body]. 1. This is my faith, that all bodies shall rise againe at the last day,Ioh. 5. 29. when Christ comes, the bodies of al the faith∣full to eternall ioy by the resurrection of Iesus Christ, though all the rest to condemnation. 2. This is my comfort, that this my body now subiect to diuerse infirmi∣ties,Iob. 19. 25. 26. 27. as sicknesse, manifold paines and sorrowes,Phil. 3. 21. &c. shall then arise a glori∣ous body like the shining bodye of
Iesus Christ,Apo. 7. 16. 17. & 14. 13 free from any more mise∣ry, paine, or labour, all teares beeing wipt away from mine eyes. 3. This is also my further assurance hereof, because I feele in my selfe the first resurrection, by a dayly rising in my inner man, to newnesse of life. A∣poc. 20. 6. 12. Article. The life euerlasting] 1. This is my faith; that in steede of this transitory life, so full of labours and griefs, God hath prouided for all this holy church a most happy and blessed life, which shall continue for euermore. Apo. 21. 22. & 22. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 2. This ioy I finde herein, that though my life bee full of crosses and troubles, euery day subiect to a thou∣sand temptations, and very momenta∣nye,Rom. 8. 18. yet then it shalbe a most glorious life,2. Cor. 4. 17 & 12. 4 when I shall dwell in Paradice in
the presence of God,Psa. 16. 11. and all his bles∣sed Saintes and Angels for euermore.1. Th. 4. 17 1. Thes. 1. 9. 10. 3. This finally confirmeth my as∣surance hereof, because I feele the life of grace begunne in mee alreadie,Gal. 2. 20. which is the beginning of this eternall life (but that then it shall be far more holy and glorious,Rom. 14. 17. and euery way more blessed then the heart of man can conceiue,) and moreouer for that he hath giuen me this grace to belieue in the sonne:Iohn 3. 18. 36. 5. 24. 25. I therefore know by the testimony of my Sauiour, that I haue eternall life;1. Ioh. 5. 11 12. and withall he hath giuen me a heart to heare his voyce with de∣light, Iohn 10. 27. 28. so that I shall neuer perish: yea my faith herein is such, that I account all things but losse and dung, in res∣pect of Christ Iesus my Sauiour,Phil. 3. 9. and al the troubles of this life,Rom. 8. 18. not worthie the glorie,Phil. 3. 13. 14. that shall bee then reuealed vnto me, & so striue hard forward to∣wards this marke, labouring alwaies to keep a good cōscience, both toward
God & man;Luk. 20. 35 that I may euer be pre∣pared for the ful fruitiō hereof, & coū∣ted worthy to enter through the gates into the Citie. Apoc. 22. 14. This is the victory that ouercommeth the worlde, euen our faith. 1. Ioh. 5. 4. Be thou faithful vnto the death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life. Apoc. 2. 10. Here is the patience of Saintes, here are they which keep the commandements of God, and the faith of Iesus. Apoc. 14. 12. I haue sworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudge∣ments alway. Psal. 119. 160. Then shall I not be confounded, when I haue respect to all thy commaundements. Psal. 119. 6. Lorde increase my faith. Luke. 17. 5. Mar. 9. 24.
The benefits of this practise of examina∣tion to incourage vs vnto it, sith it is wearisome and vnpleasant to flesh and bloud. 1. Performing it aright, wee shall a∣void al hardnesse of heart, luke warm∣nesse,Ps. 119. 6. 80. 101. 104. sleeping in any sin, and preuent an euill conscience, with many other punishments of sinne,Lam. 3. 39. 40. and withall we shalbe able to recouer our selues forth with, out of euery grosse sinne, and from Sathans power, yea euen from the gulph of deepest dispayre. Psalme. 32. 4. 5. 2. We shall dayly be putting off the old man, and putting on the newe: strippe vs off the ragges of our sinnes, and put on our wedding garment,Eph. 4. 21. 22. 23. 24. to make vs still more glorious in the eies of our bridegrome: yea we shall caste away the workes of darkenesse and put vpon vs the armor of light.Rom. 13. 12. 3. Being thus armed, wee shall be so
inabled to watch continually,Eph. 6. 11. 22. 13. 14. 15. &c. and de∣fend ourselues against Sathan,Mat. 4. 11. and all his power, that he shall neuer giue vs any deadly wounds,Iam. 4. 7. but we shall put him to flight,Rō. 16. 20. and in time trample him vtterly vnder our feet. 4. We shalbe able to see the good way and wherein the perfection of a Christian consists,Pro. 2. 9. with his true glorie and felicity in this life,Psa. 1. 1. 2 and to reioyce in them that are such:1. Ioh. 1. 1 2. 4. and withall to behold the feareful state of the world,Ps. 119. 136 to mourne for it with iust Lot:2 Pet. 2. 7. 8 so to iudge aright betweene the godly and the wicked,Luk. 19. 41. 42. and specially to iudge for our owne estate.Phi. 1. 9. 10 5. We shall be fitted in some mea∣sure according to our place and cal∣ling as wee are Christians, to teach, conuince, admonish, reproue, ex∣hort and comfort both our selues and others. 6. We shall be inabled to pray for our selues and others,Rom. 15. 14. with the whole Church of God,1. Thes. 5. 11. 24. according to our se∣uerall
necessities,Ioh. 15. 7. 1 and after the will of God in faith,1. Ioh. 5. 14  3. 22. and withall to make a most sound confession of our sinnes generall or particular, with feeling, and so most seweet thankesgiuing for all mercies, with a like comfortable pro∣fession of our faith. 7. We shall so grow in Christ, and repayre his image, as by beholding & obseruing our selues,2. Pet. 1. 10. 11. we shall get most strong consolation,1. The. 1. 3. 4. 5. that wee are true branches of that holy vine, liuely mē∣bers of Christs body,Iohn. 15. 1. 2. 7. 8. the very sheepe of his fold, to stand at his right hand, and hence most certaine assurance of eternall life sealed vnto vs by his ho∣ly Spirit,1. Tim. 4. 8. hauing in the meane time all the promises of this life,1. Cor. 3. 21. 22. 23. and that to come, all being ours and for vs. 8. Seeing our growth in grace, per∣ceiuing what sinnes wee haue ouer∣come,Rom. 5. 10. and what graces we haue ob∣tained,Gal 3. 3. we shalbe incouraged to striue forward to perfection,Heb. 10. 32. 33. vntill wee ob∣taine the ende of our strife,2. Tim. 4. 7. 8. the crowne
of glory. Apoc. 2. 9. 10. 9. Wee shall shine as starres in the world,Phil. 2. 15. to the greater glory of our god. the comfort and good ensample of Gods seruants,1. Pet. 2. 12. 15. the conuersion of the wicked, or stopping their mouthes, and leauing them more without ex∣cuse. 10. We shall increase the brightnesse of our glorie in heauen,Dan. 12. 3. as wee haue more glorified God in the earth:Rom 2. 6. 7 for the practise of this examination in the course of our life,Mat. 19. 28. 29. is a spirituall sowing,2. Cor. 9. 6. whereof wee shall in due time reape a plentifull haruest, if wee faile not. Gal. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Wee shall be sure to gette and keepe a good conscience, wherof such peace, boldnesse, securitie, and hea∣uenly ioy will follow in vs,Pro. 15. 15. as passeth all vnderstanding,Rom. 5. 3. 2. 3. and no carnall man can possibly feele,Phil. 4. 7. but onely those for whome the kingdome is prepa∣red,2. Cor. 1. 12 because it is the beginning of it in this world.Ro. 14. 17.
12. Briefly, which is the summe of all, we shall get this assurance that Ie∣sus Christ is our Sauiour anointed for vs, our King. Priest. Prophet. hauing made vs also Kings and priests,Apo. 1. 6. to our God for euermore.1. Pet. 2. 9. Some necessary questions appertayning hereunto. 1. Of senselesnesse in sinne. Quest. Can any man liuing without feeling of his sinne, and misery by it, or of his spirituall pouerty, haue any sound hope of his saluation by Christ? Ans. No. Christ is a phisition onely to them that are sicke,Luk. 4. 18. a deliuerer to them who feele themselues in prison,Esa. 61. 1. calls them only that trauell,Mat. 11. 29 30. and are ready to faint vnder the burthen of their sinnes. Of obstinacy in sinne.
Q. Can any who continue stub∣bornely in any one sinne, not submit∣ting themselues to bee ruled by the word of Christ and his ministers, in all things, hope for eternall life by Christ, or the fauour of God? A. No,Mat. 16. 24. 25. they that come to Christ must followe him forsaking themselues,Luk. 9. 23. ta∣king vp their crosse dayly,Mat. 11. 30 and learne of him to beare his yoake:Act. 3. 22. 23. if euer they will finde rest vnto their foules,Luk. 10. 16 they must heare his voice, or else they shall be destroyed from among his people. For they that despise Christs messen∣gers, refusing to heare them, despise him: and all that boast of faith,Iā. 2. 17. 18 must shew their faith by their workes, to be a liuing faith, else it shall no more pro∣fit them then the faith of the deuills, yea all must followe holinesse without which no man shall euer see God with comfort. Heb. 12. 14. 3. To whom sound comfort belongs.
Q. Can any but they who indeauor to walke with GOD in holinesse all their daies, haue any comfort that they shall be heard in their distresse, or can they pray? A. No, for the iustice of God will not admitte it: for hee that turnes away his care from hearing the law,Pro. 28. 9. his prai∣er is abhominable, and what maruell is it, if God call to vs, and wee will not heare to obey him,Prou. 1. 24. 25. 28. 29. though hee heare not vs,Psal. 66. 18 when wee call and cry to him. Therefore we must hold the prophets rule for certaine.Iohn 9. 31. That if wee but incline vnto wickednes in our hearts,Esay. 1. 15. God will not heare vs.Esa. 66. 2. 3. Experiment generall. Trie whether wee can finde any sound cōfort in our prayers, that God will heare vs in the day of our afflicti∣on or any time of neede, or that any one of the promises of GOD be∣long to vs, or so much as beleeue any
article of faith with comfort, vntill we haue soundly repented of all our sinnes, our known sinnes particularly, vnknowne generally, with a full reso∣lution to know the Lord, and feare him, walking in all his commaunde∣ments for euer. 4. Quest. Of the causes of backsliding. Quest. Sith sinne hath such feare∣full effects, and men voyde of fee∣ling of their sinne, are in so dange∣rous a case, how come a number, who haue had some good feeling, to such coldnesse in religion, hardnes of heart and senselessnesse in sinne, as to make no conscience almost of a∣ny sinne? Ans. 1. By neglecting the meanes of the preseruation of grace, as of or∣dinary hearing, reading of the Scrip∣tures and other good bookes prayer,Mar. 4. 24. 25. meditation,Heb. 10. 24 25. 38. 39. conference, examination,
fasting, and the like, or doing these things for a fashion onely, without re∣uerence, or at least not waiting, for the fruit of them. 2. By committing some grosse sin, or liuing in some knowne sin without repentance,Mat. 25. 29 as Dauid, or for not glorifi∣yng god according to our knowledge of him,Rom. 1. 21 22. 24. 16. 28. in practising all holy duetyes which he requireth, or at least, not re∣ceuing the loue of the truth. 2. Thes. 2 10. 11. 12. 3. By ouermuch greedinesse in see∣king earthly things, whether our plea∣sures, profits,Mat. 13. 23 44. 45 46 ease or credit, which steale awaye our hearts and choke grace;Luk. 8. 14 or seeking thē more then Gods glory and his fauour,Mat. 6. 33. . 37. 38. with the things concerne his kingdome,Mat. 6. 24. or with the neglect hereof,1. Ioh. 2. 15 and of the saluation of our brethren. For our loue cannot bee in the highest degree, to two contrary maisters: but as it increaseth towardes one it decreaseth towardes the other. neither will our iealous God part our
loue with the world, for eyther hee will bee loued with all the hearte,Iam. 4. 4. and with all the soule,Mat. 22. 37 and aboue all earth∣ly things,Luk. 14. 26 or not at all. 4. By familiaritie with the enemies of Gods religion,Psa. 26. 45 & 16. 3. 4 & 25. 4. or men notoriously prophane,Pro. 22. 24. 25. or luke-warme professours for it is the iust iudgement of God to leade vs into temptation hereby,Deut. 7. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. so gi∣uing vs vp for these sinnes. Some speciall preseruatiues a∣gainst euerie sinne. 1. That wee be resolute to choose rather to indure any misery, then to sinne against God. as Ioseph,Dan. 1. 8. Daniel, and the three children. 2. That wee consider the hayn∣ousnesse of the least sinne, that it is a∣gainst Gods infinite maiestie, and Christs bloud, deseruing the eternal curse of God; and more by the feare∣full punishment of the sinne of the an∣gels,Num. 29. 12. of Adam, Moses, Vzzah, Saul,
and chiefly,Deut. 3. 26. that vppon the sonne of God himselfe,2. Sam. 6. 6. 7. so to accustome our selues to subdue the very least sinnes. 3. That wee warily resist the first motions to any sinne,1. Chro. 13. 10. and bee carefull auoyd euery occasion thereof,1. The. 5. 22. as we doe of infectious disea∣ses. Gen. 39. 10.Pro. 5. 8. & 6. 25. 27. 28. 4. That we liue alwaies as in Gods presence who may take vs away on a suddaine,Gen. 17. 1. remembering also our appea∣rance before him.Iob. 32. 22. Acts. 24. 15. 16. 5. That wee keepe continually a freshe remembrance of Gods great goodnesse,2. Cor. 5. 10. 11. especially his chiefest mer∣cies bodily,Psal. 203. 2. 3. 4. 5. &c. 116. 12. & 16. 3. and spirituall, ordinarie, and extraordinary,Gen. 39. 9. to say alwaies as Ioseph,Psa. 91. 11. how can I doe this, and sinne a∣gainst my good God?
