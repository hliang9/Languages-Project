His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. My Lords and Gentlemen, I HAVE had such Assurance of your good Af∣fections to Me, that I come now to Thank you, and particularly for the Supplies you have given Me. The Season of the Year is so far Advanced, that I can no longer Delay My going into Ireland; And therefore I think it necessary to
have an Adjournment of the Par∣liament. And though it shall be but to a short Day, yet unless some great Occasion require it (of which you shall have due Notice) I do not intend you shall Sit to do Bu∣siness until the Winter; And I hope, by the Blessing of God, We shall then have a happy Meeting. In the mean time I Recommend to you the Discharge of your Du∣ties in your respective Countreys, that the Peace of the Nation may be Secured by your Vigilance and Care in your several Stations. Then the Speaker by His Majesties Command said, My Lords and Gentlemen, IT is His Majesties Pleasure, That you Adjourn your selves to the Seventh Day of July next. And accordingly both Houses did Adjourn themselves to the Seventh Day of July next. FINIS.
