FRAGMENTA REGALIA, OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE LATE QUEEN ELIZABETH, Her Times and Favourits. TO take herein the originall,  was daughter to Henry the eighth, by Anne Bull  second of six Wives, which He had, and one of the Maides of Honour to the divorced Queen Katherine of Austria (or as they now style it) nfanta of Spain, and from thence taken into the Royall Bed. That She was not of a most noble and Royall extract by Her Father, will not fall into question, for on that side there was disimbogned into  eins by a Confluence of Bloud, the very abstract of all the greatest houses in Christendom, and remark∣able it is (concerning that violent desertion of the Royall House of the Britains, by the invasion of the Saxons, and afterwards by the Con∣quest of the Normanes, that by their vicissitude of times, and through a discontinuance (almost a thousand yeers) the Royall Scepter should fall back into the Current of the old Bish Bloud, in the person of Her renowned Grandfather, Henry the seventh, together with what∣soever
the German, Norman, Burgundan, Castalian, and French atchieve∣ments with the intermarriages, which eighth hundred yeers had ac∣quired, incorporated, and brought back into the old Royall Ryne. By Her Mother She was of no Soveraign discent, yet Noble, and very Ancient in the Name, and Family of Bullen, though some erro∣niously brand it with a Citizens rise, or originall, which was yet but of a second Brother, who (as it were) divining the greatnesse, and lustre to come to his House, was sent into the City to acquire wealth, ad edific  antiquam domum, unto whose atchievements (for he was Lord Major of London) fell in as it was averred, both the bloud and inheritance of the eldest Brother, for want of issue Male, by which accumulation the house within a few discents mounted in Culmen horo∣ris, and was suddenly lated into the best Families of England, and Ire∣lad as Haward, Ormund Sockie, and divers other having thus toucht, and now leaving Her strip, I come to Her Person; and as She came to the Crown by the decease of Her Brother and Sister: under Edward She was His, and one of the darlings of Fortune, for besides the consideration of Bloud, there was between these two Princes, a concurrency, and sympathie in their Natures, and affections to∣gether, with the Celestiall bond (Conformity in Religion) which made them one, and friends, for the King ever called Her His sweetest and deerest Sister, and was scarce His own man, She being absent, which was not so between Him and the Lady Mary. Vnder His Sister, She found Her condition much altered: for it was resolved, and her destiny had decreed to set Her an Apprentice in the School of affliction, and to draw Her thorough the Ordeall fire of tryall, the better to mould and fashion Her, to rule, and So∣veraignty: which finished, and Fortune calling to minde, that the time of Her servitude was expired, gave up Her Indentures, and therewith delivered up into Her Custody a Scepter, as a reward for Her patience, which was about the twenty sixth yeer of Her Age; a time in which (as for externals) She was full blown, so was She for Her internals grown ripe, and seasoned with adversity, and in the exercise of Her Vertue, for it seems Fortune meant no more, then to shew Her a peece of Her variety, and changeablenesse of Her Nature, and so to conduct Her Her destind Felicity. She was of personge tall, of hair and complexion fair, and therewith well favoured, but high nosed, of lymbs, and feature neat, and which added to the lustre of those exterior Graces, of Stately, and Majestick comportment, participating in this more of Her Father then Mother, who was of an inferiour allay, plausable, or as the French hath it, more debonare, and affable, vertues, which might well
suite with Majesty, and which descending, as Hereditary to the Daughter, did render Her of a more sweeter temper, and endeared Her more to the love and liking of the people, who gave Her the name and fame of a most gratious and popular Prince, the atrocity of Her Fathers nature, being rebated in Hers, by the Mothers swee∣ter inclinations for to take, and that no more then the Character out of His own mouth, He never spared man in His anger, nor woman in His lust. If we search further into Her intellectuals and abilities, the whole course of Her government desciphers them to the admiration of posterity, for it was full of magnanimity tempered with Iustice, and Piety, and to speak truely, noted but with one act or taint, all Her deprivations either of life or liberty, being legall, and necessitated: She was learned (Her sex, and the time considered) beyond common belief; for letters about this time, and somewhat before, began to be of esteem, and in fashion, the former ages being overcast with the mists and fogs of the Roman ignorance,  it was the maxime that overruled the foregoing times, that ignorance was the mother of devotion. Her warres were along time more, in the auxiliary part, in assi∣stance of forraign Princes, and States, then by invasion of any, till common pollicy advised it for a safer way, to strike first, and broad, then at home, to expect the warre, in all which she was felicious, and victorious. The change and alteration of Religion upon the instant of Her accession (the smoak and fire of Her Sisters Martyrdomes, scarcely quenched) was none of Her least remarkable accounts. But the sup∣port and establishment thereof, with the means of Her subsistance amidst so powerfull enemies abroad, and those many domestique practises, were (methinks) works of inspiration, and of no humane providence, which on Her Sisters departure, She most religiously ac∣knowledged, ascribing the glory of Her deliverance to God alone, for She received the news both of the Queens death, and her pro∣clamation, by the generall consent of the House, and the publique suffrage of the people, whereat, falling on her knees (after a good time of respiration) she uttered this Verse of the Psalms, A domino fatum est istud, & est innable inoculis nostris, which we finde to this day on the stamp of her gold, with this on her silver, Posui Deumad, ∣rem meum. Her Ministers and Instruments of State, such as were participes and bare a great part of the burthen, were many, and those memorable, but they were onely Favorites, not Mimions; such as
acted more by her own Princely rules and judgements, then by their own wills and appetites, which she observed to the last: for we finde no Gaveston, Vere, or Spencer, to have swayed alone, during forty four yeers, which was a well settled, and advised maxime, for it valued her the more, it awed the most secure, and it took best with the people, and it starved all emulations, which are apt to rise and vent in obloquious acrimony (even against the Prince) where there is onely A Major Palatii. The principall note of her raign, will be, that she ruled much by faction and parties, which her self, both made, upheld, and weak∣ned, as her own great judgement advised, for I disassent from the common received opinion, that my Lord of Leicester, was absolute and above all in her Grace: and though I come somewhat short of the knowledge of those times: yet (that I might not rove, and shoote at random) I know it from assured intelligence, that it was not so, for proof whereof (among many that I could present) I will both relate, a short, and ther, a known truth; And it was thus, Bawyer a Gentleman of the Black-rod, being charged by her expresse com∣mand, to look precisely to all admissions into the Privy-Chamber, one day stayed a very gay Captain, and a follower of my Lord of Leicesters, from entrance; for that he was neither well known, nor a sworn servant to the Queen, at which repulse the Gentleman bear∣ing high on my Lords favour, told him, he might perchance procure him a discharge: Leicester coming into the Contestation, said publike∣ly (which was none of his want) that he was a Knave, and should not continue long in his office; and so turning about to go into the Queen, Bowyer (who was a bold Gentleman, and welbeloved) stept before him, and fell at Her Majesties seet, related the story, and humbly craves Her Graces pleasure, and whether my Lord of Leice∣ster was King, or Her Majesty Queen, whereunto she replyed, with her wonted oath (Gods death) my Lord, I have wisht you well, but my favour is not so lockt up for you, that others shall not partake thereof, for I have many servants, unto whom I have, and will at my pleasure bequeath my favour, and like wise resume the same, and if you think to rule here, I will take a course to see you forth coming, I will have heere but one Mistris, and no Master; and look that no ill happen to him, least it be severely required at your hands, which so quelled my Lord of Leicester, that his fained humility, was long after one of his best vertues; Moreover the Earl of Sussex then Lord Chamberlain, was his profest Antagonist to his dying day; and for my Lord of Hunsdone, and Sir Thomas Sackvile, after Lord Treasurer (who were all Contemporaries) he was wont to say of them, that
they were of the Tribe of Dan, and were Noli me tangeres, implying, that they were not to be contested with, for they were indeed of the Queens neer kindred; from whence, and in more instances I con∣clude that she was absolute and Soveraign Mistris of Her Graces: and that all those, to whom, she distributed her favours, were never more then Tenants at will, and stood on no better ground then her Princely pleasure, and their own good behaviour; and this also I present as a known observation, that she was (though very capable of Councell) absolute enough in her own resolutions, which was ever apparent even to her last, in that her aversation to grant Tyrone the least drop of her mercy, though earnestly and frequently advised, yea wrought onely by the whole Counsell of State, with very many pressing reasons; and as the state of her Kingdom then stood (I may speak it with assurance) necessitated Arguments. If we look into her inclination, as it is disposed either to mag∣nificence, or frugality, we shall finde in them many notable conside∣rations, for all her dispensations were so poysed, as though discreti∣on and Iustice had both agreed to stand at the beam, and see them weighed out in due proportion, the maturity of her yeers, and judgement meeting in a concurrency, and at such an age as seldome lapseth to excesse. To consider them apart, we have not many presidents of her libe∣rality, or of any large donatives to particular men; my Lord of Essex Book of Parkes onely excepted, which was a Princely gift, and some few more of a lesser size to my Lord of Leicester, Hatton, and others. Her reward consisted chiefly in grants of Leases, of Offices, and places of Indicature, but for ready money, and in any great summes, she was very sparing, which we partly conceive was a vertue rather drawn out by necessity, then her nature, for she had many layings out, and to her last period. And I am of opinion with Sir Walter Rawleigh, that those many brave men of our times, and of the Militiae, tasted little more of her bounty, then in her grace, and good word with their due entertainment, for she ever paid the Souldiers well, which was the honour of her times, and more then her great adver∣sary of Spain could perform, so that when we come to the conside∣ration of her frugality, the observation will be little more, then that her bounty, and it were so woven together, that the one vvas suited by an honourable vvay of spending, the other limited by a necessi∣tated vvay of sparing. The Irish action vve may call a mallady, and a Consumption of her times: for it accompanied her to her end, and it vvas of so pro∣fuse, and vast an expence, that it drevv neer a distemperature of
State, and of passion in her self, for tovvard her last, she grevv some∣vvhat hard to please, her Armes being accustomed to prosperity, and the Irish persecution, not ansvvering her expectation, and vvon∣ted successe for a good vvhile, it vvas an unthrifty, and inauspitious vvarre vvhich did much disturbe, and mislead her judgement; and the more for that it vvas a president, vvhich vvas taken out of her ovvn Pattern; for as the Queen (by vvay of diversion) had at the coming to the Crovvn, supported the revolted States of Holland, so did the King of Spain turn the trick on her self tovvards her going out, by cherishing the Irish rebellion, vvhere it falls into conside∣ration, vvhat the State of the Kingdome, and the Crovvn revenevvs vvere then able to embrace, and endure; if vve look into the esta∣blishment of those times, vvith the list of the Irish Army, considering the defeatments of Blackvvater, vvithall precedent expences, as it stood from my Lord of Essex, undertaking to the surrender of King∣sale under the Generall Mountioy; and somevvhat after, vve shall finde the horse and foot Troopes, vvere for three or four yeers together much about 20000, Which besides, the Navall charge vvhich vvas a dependant of the same Warre; in that the Queen vvas then forced to keep in continuall pay, a strong Fleet at Sea, to attend the Spanish Coasts, and Ports, both to allarum the Spaniard, and to interpret his Forces designed for the Irish assistance; so that the charge of that Warre alone, did cost the Queen 300000. pannum at least, vvhich vvas not the moytie of her other disbursements, an expence vvhich (vvithout the publique aide) the State, and the Royall reccipts, could not have much longer endured, vvhich out of her ovvn fre∣quent Letters and complaints to the Deputy Mountioy for casheering part of that List, as soon as he could, may be collected, for the Queen vvas then driven into a strait. We are naturally proan to applaud the times behinde us, and to villifie the present, for the current of her fame carries it to this day, hovv Royaly and victoriously she lived and dyed, vvithout the grie∣vance and grudge of the people, yet that truth may appear vvithout retraction from the honour of so great a Princesse, It is manifest she left more debts unpayed, taken upon the credit of her Privy-Seals, then her Progenitors did, or could have taken up that vvay in a hundred yeers before her, vvhich vvas an inforced peece of State, to lay the burthen on that horse, that vvas best able to bear it, at the dead lift, vvhen neither her receipts could yeild her relief at the pinch, nor the urgency of her affairs endure the delayes of Parlia∣mentary assistance, and for such aides it is likevvise apparent, that she received more, and vvith the love of the people, then any tvvo
of her predecessors, that took most, which was a Fortune strained out of the Subject, through the plause ability of her Comportment, and as I would say without offence the prodigall distribution of her Graces to all sorts of Subjects, for I beleeve no Prince living that was so tender of honour, and so exactly stood for the preservation of soveraignty, that was so great a Courtier of her people, yea of the Commons, and that stoopt and descended lower in presenting her person to the publike view, as she past in her progresses and per∣ambulations, and in the ejaculation of her prayers on her people; and truly though much may be given in praise of her magnanimity, and there with comply with her Parliaments, and for all that come off at last with honour and profit, yet must we ascribe some part of the commendation to the wisedomes of the times, and the choice of Parliament men, for I finde not that they were at any time given to any violent or pertinatious dispute, elections being made of grave and discreet persons, not factious and ambitious of fame, such as came not to the house with a malevolent spirit of contention, but with a preparation to consult on the publike good, rather to com∣ply, then contest with her Majesty, neither do I finde that the house was at any time weakned and pestered with the admission of too many young heads, as it hath been of later times, which remembers me of Recorder Martins speech, about the tenth of our late Soveraign Lord King Iames, when there were accounts taken of forty Gentle∣men, not above twenty, and some not exceeding sixteen, which moved him to say, that it was the ancient custome for old men to make Laws for young ones, but that then he saw, the case altered, and that there were children elected unto the great Councell of the Kingdome, which came to invade and invert nature, and to inact Laws to govern their Fathers: sure we are, the house alwayes took the common cause into their consideration, and they saw the Queen had just occasion, and need enough to use their assistance, neither do I remember that the house did ever Capitulate or preferre their pri∣vate to the publike, &c. The Queens necessities, but waited their times, and in the first place gave their supply, and according to the exigency of her affairs, yet failed not at last to obtain what they desired, so that the Queen and her Parliaments had ever the good Fortune to depart in love, and on reciprocall tearms, which are considerations which have not been so exactly observed in our last assemblies, as they might, and I would to God they had been for considering the great debt lest on the King, and in what incumbrances the house it self had then drawn him, his Majesty was not well used, though I lay not the blame on the whole suffrage of the house, where
he had many good friends, for I dare avouch, had the house been freed of half a dozen of populer and discontented persons, such (as with the fellow that burnt the Temple at Ephesus) would be talked of, though but for doing of mischief, I am confident the King had obtained, that which in reason, and at his first accession, he ought to have received freely, and without any condition, But pardon the digression, which is here remembred, not in the way of aggravati∣on, but in true zeal to the publike good, and presented in caveat to future times, for I am not ignorant how the spirit of the Kingdome now moves to make his Majesty amends on any occasion, and how desirous the Subject is to expiate that offence at any rate, may it please his Majesty gratiously to make tryall of his Subjects affection, and at what price they now value his goodnesse and magnanimity. But to our purpose, the Queen was not to learn, that as the strength of her Kingdome consisted in the multitude of her Subjects, for the security of her person rested in the love and fidelity of her people, which she politiquely affected (as it hath been thought) somewhat beneath the hight of her spirit, and naturall magnanimity. More∣over it will be a true note of her providence, that she would alwayes listen to her profit, for she would not refuse the informations of mean persons, with purposed improvement, and had learned the Phylosophy of Hoc agre, to look into her own work, of the which there is a notable example of one Carwarden an under Officer of the custome house, who observing his time presented her with a paper, shewing how she was abused in the under renting of her customes, and therewithall humbly desired her Majesty to conceal him, for that it did concern two or three of her great Councellors, whom customer Smith had bribed with 200. a man, so to loose the Queen 2000. per annum, which being made known to the Lords, they gave strickt order, that Carwarden should not have accesse to the back stairs, till at last her Majesty smelling the craft, and missing Carwarden, she sent for him back, and encouraged him to stand to his informa∣tion, which the poor man did so handsomely, that within the space of ten yeers, he brought Smith to double his rent, or to leave the customes to new Farmers, so that we may take this also into obser∣vation, that there were of the Queens Councell that were not in the Catalogue of Saints. Now as we have taken a view of some particular notions of her times, her nature, and necessities, it is not without the text, to give, a short touch on the helps and advantages of her raign, which were without paralell, for she had neither husband, brother, sister, nor children to provide for, who as they are dependants of the Crown,
so do they necessarily draw maintenance from thence, and do often times exhaust and draw deep especially when there is an ample fra∣ternity of the bloud Royall, and of the Princes of the Bloud, as it was in the time of Edward the third, and Henry the fourth, for then when the Crown cannot, the publike ought to give them honourable allowance, for they are the honour and hopes of the Kingdome, and the publike which injoyes them, hath alike interest in them, with the Father that begot them; and our Common-Law, which is the heritance of the Kingdom, did ever of old provide ayds for the primo∣genitures, and the eldest daughter; so that the multiplicity of Courts, and the great charge which necessarily follow a King, and Queen, a Prince, and the Royall issue, was a thing which was not in rerum natura, during the space of forty yeers, and which by time was worn out of memory, and without the consderation of the present times, Insomuch, that the aydes given to the late and right noble Prince Henry, and to his sister the Lady Elizabeth, were at first generally re∣ceived for impositions of a new Coynage. Yea the late impositions for Knightwood (though an ancient Law) fell also into the imputation of a tax of novelty, for that it lay long covered in the embers of division, between the Houses of York and Lancaster, and forgotten, or connived at by the succeeding Princes, so that the strangenesse of the observation, and the difference of those latter raignes is; that the Queen took up beyond the power of the Law, which fell not into the murmure of the people, and her successors nothing but by warrant of the Law, which neverthelesse was conceived (through disuse) to be injurious to the liberty of the Kingdome. Now before I come to any further mention of her favorits (for hitherto I have delivered, but some obvious passages, thereby to prepare and smooth a way for the rest that follows) it is requisite that I touch on the reliques of the other raign, I mean the body of her sisters Councell of State, which she retained intire; neither re∣moving, nor discontenting any, although she knew them averse to her Religion (and in her sisters time perverse towards her person) and private to her troubles and imprisonment: A prudence which was incomparable with her sisters nature, for she both dissipated and persecuted the major part of her brothers Councell, but this will be of certainty, that how compliable soever, and obsequious she found them, yet for a good space she made little use of their Councells, more then in the ordinary course of the board: for she held a dormant Table in her own Princely brest, yet she kept them together, and their places without any suddain change, so that we may say of them, that they were of the Court, not of the Councell,
for whilst she amazed them with a kinde of premissive disputation concerning the points controverted by both Churches, she did set down her own reservations, without their privity, and made all her progressions gradations. But so that the tenents of her secrecy with intent of her establishment, were pitcht before it was knovvn where the Court would sit dovvn; neither do I finde that any of her sisters Councell of state were either repugnant to her religion, or opposed her doings (Englfield, Master of the horse excepted) who withdrew himself from the board, and shortly after from out her Dominions, so plyable and obedient they were to change with the times, and their Princes, and of this there will fall in heer a relation both of recreation, and of knovvn truth▪ Pawle Marquesse of Wincheste, and Lord Treasurer, having served then four Princes in as various and changeable season, that I may well say, time, nor any age hath yeilded the like president. This man being noted to grow high in her favour (as his place, and experience required) was questioned by an intimate friend of his, how he stood up for thirty yeers together amidst the changes, and raignes of so many Chancellors and great personages, why quoth the Marquesse, Ortus sunt ex salice, non ex quecu, I was made of the pliable Willovv, not of the stubborn Oake, and truly the old man hath taught them all, especially William Earl of Pembroke, for they tvvo were alvvayes of the Kings religion, and over zealous pro∣fessors. Of this it is said, that being both younger brothers (yet of noble Houses) they spent what was left them, and come on trust to the Court, vvhereupon the bare stock of their Wits, they began to traffick for themselves, and prospered so vvell, that they got, spent, and left more then any Subjects from the Norman Conquest, to their ovvn times, vvhereunto it hath been prettily replyed, that they lived in a time of dissolution. To conclude them, of any of the former raign, ir is said, that these tvvo lived and dyed (chiefly) in her favour. The latter upon his sonnes marriage, vvhich the Lady Kth rine Grey, vvs like utterly to have lost himself, but at the instant of the consummation, apprehending the insafety, and danger of an intermarriage vvith the bloud Royall, he fell at the Queens feet, vvhere he both acknovvledged his presumption vvith tears, and projected the cause, and the divorce together, and so quick he vvas at his vvork (for it stood him upon) that upon repudiation of the Lady, he clapt up a marriage for his sonne the Lord Herbert vvith Mr▪ Sidney Daughrer to Sir Henry Sydney, then Lord Deputy of Ireland, the blovv falling on Edward late Earl of Hereford▪ vvho (to his cost) took up the divorced Lady, of vvhom the Lord Beauchampe vvas borne,
and William Earl of Hereford is descended. I come how to present those of her own election, which she either admitted to her secrets of State, or took into her grace and favour, of whom in their or∣der, I crave leave to give unto posterity a cautious description, with a short Charracter, or draught of the persons themselves: for without offence to others, I would be true to my self, their memo∣ries and merits distinguishing them of the militiae, from the  and of these she had as many, and those as able Ministers, as any of her Progenitors. Leicester. IT will be out of doubt, that my Lord of Leicester was one of the first whom she made Master of the Horse, he was the youngest Sonne (then living) of the Duke Northumberland beheaded , and his Father was that Duy, which our Histories couple with ; and both so much infamed for the Caterpillars of the Com∣mon-wealth, during the raign of Henry the seventh: who being a noble extract, was executed the first yeer of Henry the eighth, but not thereby so extinct, but that he left a plentifull estate, and such a Sonne, who (as the vulgar speaks it) could live without the teat; for out of the Ashes of his Fathers infamy, he rose to be a Duke, and as high, as subjection could permit, or Soveraignty endure; and though he could not finde out any appellation to assume the Crown in his own person, yet he projected, and very neerly effected it for his Sonne Gulbert, by intermarriage with the Lady  Grey, and so by that way to bring it about into his loynes: Observations, which though they lye behinde us, and seem impertinent to the Text, yet are they not much extravagant, for they must lead, and shew us how the after passages were brought about with the dependances, and on the hinges of a collaterall workmanship: and truely, it may amaze a well settled judgement to look back into those times, and to consider how this Duke could attain to such a pitch of greatnesse, his Father dying in ignominy, and at the Gallows, his estate coniscate, and that for peeling and polling, by the clamor, and crucige of the people, but when we better think upon it, we finde that he was given up, but as a Sacrifice to please the people, not for any offence committed against the person of the King, so that upon the matter he was a Martyr of the Prerogative, and the King in honour could do no lesse then give back to his Son the priviledge of his bloud, with the acquirings of his Fathers profession, for he was a Lawyer, and of the Kings Councell, at Law before he came to be ex ,
where besides the lickings of his own fingers, he got the King a Masse of riches, and that not with the hazard, but the losse of his fame and life, for the Kings Fathers sake. Certain it is, that his sonne was left rich in purse and brain, which are good foundations, and full to ambition, and it may be supposed, he was on all occasions well heard of the King, as a person of marke and compassion in his eye, but I finde not that he did put up for advancement, during Henry the eights time, although a vast aspirer, and provident storier. It seemes he thought the Kings raign was much given to the falling sicknesse, but espying his time fitting, and the Soveraignty in the hands of a pupill Prince, he thought he might as well, then put up for it, as the best, for having then possession of bloud, and a purse, with a head-peece of a vast extent, he soon got honour, and no sooner there, but he began to side it with the best, even with the Protector; and in conclusion got his, and his Brothers heads▪ still aspyring, till he expired, in the losse of his own, so that posterity may by reading the Father and the Grandfather, make judgement of the sonne; for we shall finde that this Robert (whose originall we have now traced the better to present him) was inheritor of the ge∣nius, and craft of his Father; and Ambrose, of the estate, of whom hereafter we shall make some short mention. We take him now as he was admitted into the Court, and the Queens favour, where he was not to seek to play his part well, and dexteriously. But his play was chiefly at the forgame, not that he was a learner at the latter, but he loved not the after wit, for they report (and I think not untruely) that he was seldome behinde hand with his Gamesters, and that they alwayes went away with the losse. He was a very godly person, and singular well featured, and all his youth well favoured, and of a sweet aspect, but high foreheaded, which as I should take it, was of no discommendation: but towards his latter end (which with old men, was but a middle age) he grew high coloured and red faced; so that the Queen in this, had much of her Father, for (excepting some of her kindred, and some few that had handsome wits in crooked bodies, she alwayes took per∣sonage in the way of her election, for the people hath it to this day in proverb, King Harry loved a man: Being thus in her grace, she called to minde, the sufferings of his Ancestors, both in her Fathers and sisters raignes, and restored his, and his brothers bloud, creating Ambrs the elder, Earl of Warwick, and himself, Earl of Leicester, &c. And he was ex rimitis, or of her first choice, for he rested not there, but long enjoyed her favour; and therewith, much what he listed,
till time and emulation (the companions of great ones) had resolved on his period, and to cover him at his setting in a cloud at Cornebury▪ not by so violent a death, and by the fatall sentence of judicature, as that of his Fathers, and Grandfathers was, but as it is suggested by that poyson which he had prepared for others, wherein they report him a rare Artist, I am not bound to give credit to all vulgar relati∣ons, or to the libells of the times, which are commonly forced, and falsified suitable to the moods, and humours of men, in passion, and discontent, but that which leads me to think him no good man, is (amongst others of known truth) that of my Lord of Essex death in Ireland, and the marriage of his Lady yet living, which I forbear to presse, in regard that he is long since dead, and others living, whom it may concern. To take him in the observations of his Letters, and Writings (which should best set him off) for such as fell into my hands, I never yet saw a style or phrase, more seeming religious, and fuller of the strains of devotion, and were they not sincere, I doubt much of his well being, and I may fear he was too well seen in the Aphorismes and principles of Nicholas the Florentine, and in the reaches of Caesar Borgia; and hitherto I have onely touched him in his Courtship. I conclude him in his Lance, he was sent Governour by the Queen to the united States of Holland, where we reade not of his wonders, for they say that he had more of Mercury then Mars, and that his de∣vice might have been, without prejudice to the great Caesar, Veni, vidi, redii. Sussex. HIs Corrivall before mentioned, was Thomas Radcliff Earl: of Sussex, who, (in his constellation was his direct opposite) for he was indeed one of the Queens Martialists, and did very good service in Ireland, at her first accession, till she recalled him to the Court, where she made him Lord Chamberlaine, but he played not his game with that cunning, and dexterity, as Leiceste did, who was much the more faceate Courtier, though Sussex was thought much the honester man, and farre the better souldier, but he lay too open on his guard. He was a goodly Gentleman, and of a brave Noble nature, true and constant to his friends and servants, he was also of a very Noble and ancient Lyneage, honoured through many descents by the Title
of Viscounts, Fitzwalters: Moreover there was such an Antipathy in his nature to that of Leicesters that being together in Court, and both in high imployments they grew to a direct frowardnesse, and were in continuall opposition, the on setting the watch, the other the senti∣nell, each on the other actions and motions, for my Lord of Sussex was of a great spirit, which backt with the Queens speciall favour, and supported by a great and ancient inheritance, could not brook the others Empire: Insomuch as the Queen upon sundry occasions had somewhat to do to appease, and attain them, untill death parted the competition, and let the place of Leiceste, who was not long alone without his rivall in grace and command, and to conclude this Favorite, it is confidently affirmed, that lying in his last sicknesse, he gave this caveat to his friends, I am now passing into another world, and I must now leave you to your Fortunes, and to the Queens grace, and goodnesse: but beware of the Gipsey, meaning Liceter, for he will be to hard for you all, you know not the best so well as I do. Lord Burleigh. I Now come to the next, which was Secretary William Cecill, for on the death of the old Marquesse of Winchester▪ he came up in his room, a person of a most subtill and active spirit, who though he stood not altogether by the way of constellation, and making up of a part and faction, for he was wholly intentive to the service of his Mistris, and his dexterity, experience, and merit, challenged a room in the Queens favour, which ecclipsed the others over seeming great∣nesse, and made it appear that there were others that steered, and stood at the Helm besides himself, and more Starres in the Firmament of her grace then,  Maior, or the Bear with the ragged staffe. He was borne (as they say in Lincola shire, but as some upon knowledge averre, of a younger Brother of the Cecills of Hartford-shire, a family (of my ovvn knovvledge) though novv private, yet of no mean antiquity, vvho being exposed, and sent to the City, as poor Gentleman use to do their younger Sonns, he came to be a rich man on Loo-bridge, and puchasing in Lincol-shire, vvhere this man vvas born, he vvas sent to Cambridge, then to the Innes of Court, and so he came to serve the Duke of Ommerse in the time of his Pro∣tectership, as Secretary, and having a pregnancy to great inclinati∣ons, he came by degrees to a higher conversation vvith the chiefest
affairs of State, and Councels; but on the fall of the Duke he stood some yeers in umbrage, and without imployment, till the State found and needed his abilities, and though we finde not that he was taken into any place, during Maries raign, unlesse (as some have said) to∣wards the last, yet the Councell on severall occasions made use of him, and at the Queens entrance he was admitted Secretary of State, afterwards he was made Master of the Court of Wards, then Lord Treasurer, a person of most requisite abilities; and indeed the Queen began then to need, and to seek out for men of both Garbs, and so I conclude, and rank this great Instrument of State, amongst the Togati, for he had not to do with the sword, more then as the great pay-master, and Contriver of the Warre, which shortly followed, wherein he accomplished much thorough his theoricall knowledge at home, and his intelligence abroad, by unlocking the Councells of the Queens enemies. We must now take (and that of truth) into observation, that untill the tenth of her raign, her times were calm and serene, though sometimes a little overcast, as the most glorious Sunne risings, are subject to shadowings and droppings in, for the clouds of Spain, and Vapors of the holy League, began then to disperse and threaten her serenity; Moreover, she was then to provide against some intestine storms, which began to gather in the very heart of her Kingdom, all which had a relation, and correspondency, each with the other to dethrone her, and to disturbe the publike tranquillity, and there∣withall (as a principall work) the established Religion, for the name of Recusant began then, and first to be known to the World, and till then the Catholiques were no more then Church Papists, but were commanded by the Popes expresse letters, to appear, and forbear Church going, as they tender their holy Father, and the holy Catholike Church their Mother: so that it seems the Pope had then his ayms to take a true muster of his children, but the Queen had the greater advantage, for she likewise took tale of her apostate Subjects, their strength, and how many they were that had given up their names unto Baal, who then by the hands of some of his Prosilits fixed his Bulls on the Gates of Pauls, which discharged her Subjects of all fidelity, and layed siege to the received faith, and so under the vail of the next Successor, to re∣plant the Catholike Religion, so that the Queen had then a new task and work in hand, that might well awak her best providence, and required a muster of men of Armes, as well as Courtships, and Councels, for the times began then to be quick and active, fitter for stronger motions, then those of the Carpet, and measure, and it will
be a true note of her magnanimity, that she loved a souldier, and had a propension in her nature to regard, and alwayes to grace them, which the Courtiers taking into observation, took it as an invitation to winne honour, together with their Majesties favour, by exposing themselves to the Warres, especially when the Queens, and the affairs of the Kingdom stood in some necessity of a Souldier, for we have many instances of the Sallies of the Nobility, and Gentry, yea and out of the Court, and her Privy favorits (that had any touch or tincture of Mars in their inclinations, and to steal away without li∣cence, and the Queens privity, which had like to have cost some of them dear, so predominant were their thoughts and hopes of honor growing in them, as we may truly observe in the expositions of Sir Philip Sydney, my Lord of Essex, Mountjoy, and divers others, whose absence, and the manner of their cruptions, was very distastfull to her: whereof I can here adde a true, and no impertinent Story, and that of the last Mountjoy, vvho having tvvice or thrice, stoln a∣vvay into Britain (vvhere under Sir Iohn Norris he had then a com∣pany) vvithout the Queens leave and privity, she sent a Messenger unto him, vvith a strict charge to the generall to see him sent home, vvhen he came into the Queens presence, she fell into a kinde of re∣viling, demanding hovv he durst go over vvithout her leave, serve me so quoth she once more, and I vvill lay you fast enough for run∣ning: you vvill never leave untill you are knockt on the head, as that inconsiderate fellovv Sydney vvas, you shall go vvhen I send you, in the mean time see that you lodge in the Court (vvhich vvas then at White-Hall) vvhere you may follovv your Book, read and dis∣course of the Warres. But to our purpose it fell out happily to those, and (as I may say) to those times, that the Queen during the calm of her raign vvas not idle, not rockt a sleep vvith security, for she had been very pro∣vident in the Reparation, and Augmentation of her Shipping, and Ammunition; and I knovv not, vvhether by a foresight of policy, or an instinct, it came about, or vvhether it vvas an act of her com∣passion. But it is most certain, that she sent Levies, and no small Troopes to the assistance of the revolted States of Holland, before she had received any affront from the King of Spain, that might deserve, or tend to a breach in hostility, vvhich the Papists to this day main∣tain, vvas the provocation, and cause of the after Warres, but omit∣ting vvhat might be said to this point, those Netherland Warres vvere the Queens Seminaries, and the Nurseries of very many brave Soul∣diers, and so vvere likevvise the Civill Warres of France (vvhither she sent five severall Armies) the Fenceschooles that inured the youth
and Gallantry of the Kingdome, and it was a Militia wherein they were daily in acquaintance, with the discipline of the Spaniard, who were then turned the Queens inveterate enemies. And this have I taken into observation, her Dis Halcinii, those yeers of hers which were more serene and quiet then those that fol∣lowed, which though they were not lesse propitious, as being touched more with the point of honour and victory, yet were they troubled, and ever clouded over, both with domestiques, and forraign macchi∣nations, and it is already quoted, they were such as awakened her spirits, and made her cast about how to defend, rather by offending, and by the way of diversion to prevent all invasions, then to expect them, which was a peice of policy of the times, and with this I have noted the causes or principia of the Warres following, and like∣wise pointed to the seed-plots, from whence she took up those brave men, and plants of honour, which acted on the theatre of Mars, and on whom she dispersed the rayes of her grace, which were per∣sons in their kindes of rare vertues, and such as might (out of height of merit) pretend interest to her favour, of which rank, the num∣ber will equall, if not exceed that of the Gown-men, in recount of whom I proceed with Sir Philip Sydney. Sir Philip Sydney. HE was sonne to Sir Henry Sydney, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and President of Wales, a person of great parts, and in no mean grace with the Queen, his Mother was Sister to my Lord of Leicester, from whence we may conjecture, how the Father stood up in the place of honour, and imployment, so that his descent was appa∣rantly noble on both sides; for his education, it was such as travell, and the university could afford, or his Tutors infuse, for after an incredible proficiency in all the species of learning, he left the Aca∣demiall life, for that of the Court; whither he came by his Vncles invitation, famed aforehand by a noble report of his accomplish∣ments, which together with the state of his person, framed by a naturall propension to Armes, he soon attracted the good opinion of all men, and was so highly prized in the good opinion of the Queen, that she thought the Court deficient without him, and whereas (through the fame of his deserts) he was in the election, for the Kingdome of Pole, she refused to further his advancement, not out of emulation, but out of fear to loose the jewell of her
times; he married the Daughter and sole heir of Sir Francis Walsingham, then Secretary of State, a Lady destinated to the Bed of honour, who (after his deplorable death at Zutphen in the Netherlands, where he was Governour of Vlishing, and at the time of his Vncles being there) was married to my Lord of Essex, and since his death, to my Lord of Saint Albons, all persons of the sword, and otherwise of great honour and vertue. They have a very quaint, and factious figment of him, that Mar and Mercury fell at variance, whose servant he should be, and there is an Epigrammist that saith, that Art and Nature had spent their ex∣cellencies in his fashioning, and fearing they should not end what they begun, they bestowed him on Fortune, and nature stood musing, and amased to behold her own work. But these are the petulancies of Poets. Certain it is, he was a noble and matchlesse Gentleman, and it may be justly said without hiperboles of fiction, as it was of Coto , that he seemed to be borne, to that onely which he went about Versalitis ingenii, as Plutarch hath it, but to speak more of him, were to make him lesse. Sir Francis Walsingham. SIR Francis Walsingham, (as we have said) had the honour to be Sir Philip Sydneys Father in Law, he was a Gentleman (at first) of a good house: but of a better education, and from the Vniversity travelled for the rest of his learning, he was doubtlesse the best Lin∣gist of the times, but knew best how to use his own tongue, where∣by he came to be imployed in the cheifest affairs of State; he was sent Ambassador into France, and stayed there Leiger long, in the heat of the Civill Warres, and at the same time, that Monsieur was here a Suitor to the Queen, and if I be not mistaken, he played the very same part there, as since Gundamre did heer; at his return he was taken principall Secretary, and was one of the great Engines of State, and of the times, high in the Queens favour, and a watchfull servant over the safety of his Mistris. They note him to have had certain curiosities, and secret wayes of intelligence above the rest, but I must confesse I am to seek; Where∣fore he suffered Parry to play so long on the hook, before he hoysed him up; and I have been a little curious in the search thereof, though I have not to do with the Arcan Imperii.
For to know is sometimes a burthen, and I remember, that it was Ovids cimen aut error, that he saw too much. But I hope these are Collateralls of no danger; but that Parry having an intent to kill the Queen, made the way of his accesse, by betraying of others, and impeaching of the Priests of his own correspondency, and thereby had accesse and conference with the Queen; and also often∣times familiar, and private conference with Walsingham, will not be the quere of the Mystery, for the Secretary might have had end of dis∣covery on a further maturity of the Treason, but that after the Queen knew Parryes intent, why she should then admit him to pri∣vate Discourse, and Walsingham to suffer it, considering the condition of all assaylngs, and to permit him to go, where, and whether he listed, and onely on the security of a dark sentinell set over him, was a peece of reach and hazard, beyond my apprehension. I must again professe, that having read many of his Letters (for they are commonly sent to my Lord of Leicester, and Burleigh out of France, containing many fine passages, and secrets, yet if I might have been beholding to his Cyphers (whereof they are full) they would have told pretty tales of the times, but I must now close up, and rank him amongst the Togati, yet chief of those that layed the foundation of the French and Dutch Warres, which was another peece of his finenesse, and of the times, with one observation more; that he was one of the great allayes of the Austerian embracements, for both himself and Stafford that preceded him, might well have been compared to the fiend in the Gospel, that sowed his tares in the night, so did they their feeds of division in the dark, and it is a likely report that they father on him, at his return, that the Queen said unto him with some sensibility of the Sanish designes, on France, Madam I beseech you be content not to fear, the Spaniard hath a great appetite, and an excellent digestion, but I have fitted him with a Bone for this twenty yeers, that your Majesty shall have no cause to doubt him, provided that if the fire chance to slack, which I have kindled, you will be ruled be me, and now, and then cast in some English fewell, which will revive the flame.
Willoughby. MY Lord Willoughby, was one of the Queens first sword men, he was of the ancient extract of the Barts, but more ennobled by his Mother, who was Dutches of Suffolk. He was a great Master of the Art Military, and was sent Generall into France, and commanded the second of five Armies, that the Queen sent thither in ayd of the French: I have heard it spoken that had he not slighted the Court, but applyed himself to the Queen, he might have enjoyed a plentifull portion of her grace, and it was his saying (and it did him no good) that he was none of the Rplitia, intimating, that he could not creep on the ground, and that the Court was not his Element, for indeed as he was a great Souldier, so was he of a sutable magnanimity, and could not brook the obse∣quiousnesse, and aiduity of the Court, and as he then was some∣what descending from youth, happily he had, an animam recrendi and to make a safe retreat. Sir Nicholas Bacon. I Come to another of the Togati, Sir Nicholas Bacon, an arch peice of Wit and Wisedome, he was a Gentleman, and a man of Law, and of great knowledge therein, whereby, together with his other parts of learning and dexterity, he was promoted to be Keeper of the great Seal, and being of Kin to the Treasurer Burleigh, had also the help of his hand to bring him into the Queens favour, for he was abundantly factious, which took much with the Queen, when it was suited with the season, as he was well able to judge of his times; he had a very quaint saying, and he used it often to good purpose, that he loved the jest well, but not the losse of his friend: he would say, and that though he knew it, Vansquisque si fortune ober, was a true and good principle, yet the most in number were those that marred themselves, but I will never forgive that man, that looseth himself, to be rid of his jest. He was Father to that refined wit, which since hath acted a dis∣asterous part, on the publike stage, and of late, sate in his Fathers room, as Lord Chancellor; those that lived in his age, and from whence I have taken this little modell of him, gives him a lively Character, and they decipher him, for another Solo, and the Synon
of those times, such a one as Aedipus was in dissolving of riddles; doubtlesse, he was as able an instrument, and it was his commenda∣tion, that his-head was the Mawle (for it was a great one,) and therein he kept the Wedge, that entred the knotty peeces, that came to the Table: and now I must again fall back, to smooth, and plain away to the rest that is behinde, but not from the purpose. There were about these times, two Rivals in the Queens favour, old Sir Francis Knowles, Controuller of the House, and Sir Henry Norris, whom she called up at a Parliament to sit with the Peers in the higher House, as Lord Norris of Rcott, who had married the Daughter and Heir of the old Lord Williams of Tain, a Noble person, and to whom in the Queens adversity, she had been committed to safe custody, and from him had received, more then ordinary observances. Now such was the goodnesse of the Queens nature, that she neither for∣got the good turns received from the Lord Williams, neither was she unmindefull of this Lord Norris, whose Father, in her Fathers time, and in the businesse of her mother dyed in a noble cause, and in the jnstification of her innocency. Lord Norris. MY Lord Norris had by this Lady an ample issue, which the Queen highly respected, for he had six sonnes, and all Martiall brave men, the first was William his eldest, and Father to the late Earl of Bark-shire, Sir Iohn, Vulgarly called, Generall Norris, Sir Edward, Sir Thomas, Sir Henry, and Maximilian, men of an haughty courage, and of great experience in the conduct of Millitary affairs, and to speak in the Character of their merit, they were such persons of such renown, and worth, as future times must out of duty, owe them the debt of an honourable memory. Knowles. SIR Francis Knowles, was somewhat of the Queens affinity, and had likewise no incompetent issue, for he had also William his Eldest, and since Earl of Banbury, Sir Thomas, Sir Robert, and Sir Francis, if I be not a little mistaken in their names, and Marshalling; and there was also the Lady Lettice, a Sister of these, who was first Countesse of Essex, and after of Leicester, and these were also brave
men in their times, and places; but they were of the Court, and Carpet, not led by the genious of the Camp. Between these two Families, there was (as it falleth out amongst great Ones, and Competitors for favour) no great correspondency, and there were some Seeds, either of emulation, or distrust, cast be∣tween them, which had they not been disjoyned in the residence of of their persons, (as it was the Fortune of their employments) the one side attending the Court, the other the Pavillion, Surely, they would have broken out into some kinde of hostility▪ or at least they would have wrastled one in the other, like Trees, in∣circled with joy, for there was a time when (both these Fraternities being met at Court:) there passed a challenge between them at cer∣tain exercises (the Queen and the old men being Spectators) which ended in a flat quarrell amongst them all) and I am perswaded (though I ought not to judge) that there were some reliques of this fewd, that were long after the causes of the one Families (almost utter) extirpation, and of the others improsperity: for it was a known truth, that so long as my Lord of Leicester lived, who was the main Pillar of the one side, as having married the Sister, none of the other side took any deep rooting in the Court: though other∣wise they made their wayes to honour by their swords, and that which is of more note (considering my Lord of Leicesters use of men of Armes, being shortly after sent Governour to the revolted States, and no Souldier himself) is that, he made no more accompt of Sir Iohn Norris, a Souldier then deservedly famoused, and trained from a Page, under the discipline of the great Captain of Christendome, the dmirall Castillion, and of command in the French, and Dutch Wares, almost twenty yeers. It is of further observation, that my Lord of Essex (after Leicesters decease) though initated to Armes, and honoured by the Generall, in the Portugll expedition: whether out of instigation (as it hath been thought) or out of ambition and jea∣lousie, to be ecclipsed, and over shadowed by the fame and splendor of this great Commander, loved him not in sincerity. Moreover, certain it is, he not onely crusht, and (upon all occasions) queld the growth of this brave man, and his famous Brethren, but therewith drew on his own fatall end, by undertaking the Irish Action; in a time when he left the Court, empty of friends, and full fraught with his profest enemies: but I forbear to extend my self in any fur∣ther relation upon this Subject, as having left some notes of truth, in these two noble Families, which I would present, and therewith toucht somewhat, which I would not, if the equity of the Narrati∣on would have admitted an intemission.
Sir Iohn Perrot. SIR Iohn Perrot was a goodly Gentleman, and of the sword, and as he was of a very ancient descent, as an heir to many abstracts of gentry, especially from Guy de Bryan of Lawhern, so was he of a vast estate, and came not to the Court for want, and to these ad∣juncts, he had the endowments of courage, and height of spirit, had it lighted on the allay of temper, and discretion the defect, where∣of, with a native freedome, and boldnesse of speech, drew him on to a clouded setting, and laid him open to the spleen and advantage of his enemies, amongst whom Sir Christopher Hatton was profest. He was yet a wise man, and a brave Courtier, but rough, and partici∣pating more of active then sedentary motions, as being in his con∣stellation destinated for Armes. There is a quere of some denotati∣ons, how he came to receive his foyl, and that in the Catastrophe, for he was strengthned with honourable allyances and the privy friendships of the Court. My Lord of Leicester and Burleigh, (both his contemporaries and familiars. But that there might be (as the Adage hath it) falsity in friendship, and we may rest satisfied, that there is no dispute against fate. They quote him, for a person that loved too stand to much alone, and on his own legs, of too often recesses, and discontinuance from the Queens presence, a fault which is incompetible with the wayes of Court and favour. He was sent Lord Deputy into Ireland, (as it was thought) for a kinde of haughtinesse of spirit, and repugnancy in Councels: or as others have thought, the fittest person, then to bridle the insolency of the Irish, and probable it is, that both these (considering the sway) that he would have at the board, and head in the Queens) concurred, and did a little conspire his remove, and his ruine. But into Ireland he went, where he did the Queen very great and many services, if the surplusage of the measure did not abate the value of the merit, as after times found that to be no Paradox, for to save the Queens purse (which both her self) and my Lord Treasurer Burleigh ever took for good services) he imposed on the Irish the charge of bearing their own armes, which both gave them the possession, and taught them the use of weapons, which proved in the end a most fatall work, both in the profusion of bloud and treasure.
But at his return, and on some accompt sent home before, touch∣ing the state of the Kingdome, the assiduous testimonies of her grace towards him, till by his retreat to his Castle at Cay, where he was then building, and out of desire to be in command at home (as he had been abroad) together with the hatred and practise of Hatton, then in high favour, whom not long before, he had too bit∣terly tanted for his dancing, he was accused of high Treason, and for high words, and a forged letter condemned, though the Queen, on the news of his condemnation, swore by her wonted oath, that they were all knaves; and they deliver with assurance, that on his return to the Tower, after his Tryall, he said in oaths, and in fury, to the Lieuteuant Sir Owen Hopon, what will the Queen suffer her Brother to be offered up, as a Sacrifice to the envy of my frisking adversaries; which being made known to the Queen, and the war∣rant for his execution tendered, and somewhat enforced, she refused to signe it, and swore he should not dye, for he was an honest, and a faithfull man: and surely, though not altogether to set up our rest, and faith upon tradition, and upon old reports, as that Sir Thomas Perrot his Father was a Gentleman of the privy Chamber, to Henry the eigth, and in the Court married to a Lady of great honour, of the Kings familiarity, which are presumptions of some implication: But if we go a little further, and compare his Picture, his qualities, gesture, and voyce, with that of the Kings, which memory retains, yet amongst us, they will plead strongly, that he was a subreptious childe of the bloud Royall. Certain it is, that he lived not long in the Tower, and that after his decease, Sir Thomas Perrot his sonne (then of no mean esteem with the Queen) having before married my Lord of Essex Sister, since Countesse of Northumberland, had restitution of all his Lands, though after his decease also (which immediately followed) the Crown resumed his estate, and took advantage of the former attainder. And to say the truth, the Priests forged letter, was at his arraign∣ment, thought but as a fiction of envy, and was soone after ex∣ploded by the Priests own confession, but that which most exaspe∣rated the Queen, and gave advantage to his enemies, was (as Sir Walter Rawleigh takes into his observation) words of disdain, for the Queen by sharp and reprehensive Letters, had nettled him, and shortly after sending others of approbation, commending his service, and intimating an invasion from Spain, which he no sooner perused, but he said publiquely in the great Chamber at Dublin: Lo now she is ready to pisse her self for fear of the Spaniard; I am again one of her white Boys.
Words which are subject to a various construction, and tended to some disreputation of his Soveraign, and such as may serve for in∣struction to persons in place of honour, and command to beware of the violences of nature, but especially of the exorbitances of the tongue: and so I conclude him with this double observation, the one of the innocency of his intentions (exempt and clear from the guilt of Treason) and disloyalty, the other of the greatnesse of his heart, for at his arraignment he was so little dejected, by what might be alleaged and proved against him, that he rather grew troubled with choller, and in a kinde of exaspiration despised his Iury, though of the order of Knighthood, and of the speciall Gentry, claiming the priviledge of tryall, by the Peers, and Barronage of the Realm, so prevalent was that of his native genious, and the haughtinesse of his spirit, which accompanied him to his last, and till (any diminu∣tion of courage) it brake in peeces, the cords of his magnanimity, for he dyed suddenly in the Tower, and when it was thought the Queen did intend his inlargement, with the restitution of his posses∣sions, which were then very great, and comparable to most of the Nobility. Hattor. SIR Chrystopher Hatton came into the Court, as his opposite, Sir Iohn Perrot was wont to say, by the Galliard, for he came thither as a private Gentleman of the Innes of Court in a Mask, and for his activity, and person, which was tall, and proportionable, taken into her favour, he was first made vice Chamberlain, and shortly afterward advanced to the place of Lord Chancellor; a Gentleman that besides the graces of his person, and dancing, had also the ad∣jectaments of a strong and subtill capacity, one that could soon learn the discipline and garb, both of the times and Court, the truth is, he had a large proportion of gifts, and endowments, but too much of the season of envy, and he was a meer vegetable of the Court, that sprung up at night, and sunk again at his noon. Lord Effingham. MY Lord of Effingham, though a Courtier betimes, yet I finde not, that the Sunshine of her favour, broke out upon him, untill
she took him into the Ship, and made him high Admirall of England, for his extract, it may suffice that he was the sonne of a Howard, and of a Duke of Norfolk. And for his person, as goodly a Gentleman, as the times had any, if nature had not been more intentive to compleat his person, then Fortune to make him rich, for the times considered which were then active, and a long time after lucrative, he dyed not wealthy, yet the honester man, though it seems the Queens purpose was to tender the occasion of his advancement, and to make him capable of more honour, which at his return from Cadize accounts, she conferred it upon him, creating him Earl of Nottingham, to the great discontent of his Colleague, my Lord of Essex, who then grew accessive in the Appetite of her favour, and the truth was so exorbitant in the limi∣tation of the Soveraigne aspect, that it much alienated the Queens grace from him, and drew others together with the Admirall, to a combination, and to conspire his ruine: and though I have heard it from that party (I mean of the Admiralls faction) that it lay not in his proper power to hurt my Lord of Essex, yet he had more followers, and such as were well skilled in setting of the Gynne, but I leave this, to these of an other age. It is out of doubt, that the Admirall was a good honest, and a brave man, and a faithfull servant to his Mistris, and such a one as the Queen out of her own Princely judgement, knew to be a fit instrument for that service, for she was no ill proficient in the read∣ing of men, as well as Books, and his sundry expeditions, as that afore mentioned, and 88. doth both expresse his worth, and mani∣fest the Queens trust, and the opinion she had of his fidelity, and conduct. Moreover, the Howards were of the Queens alliance, and con∣sanguinity by her mother, which swayed her affection; and bent it toward this great house, and it was a part of her naturall propensi∣on, to grace and support ancient nobility, where it did not intrench, neither invade her interest, for on such trespasses she was quick and tender, and would not spare any whatsoever, as we may observe in the case of the Duke, and my Lord of Hereford, whom she much favoured, and countenanced, till they attempted the forbidden fruit, the fault of the last, being in the severest interpretation, but a tres∣passe of incroachment, but in the first it was taken for a ryot against the Crown, and her own Soveraign power, and as I have ever thought, the cause of her aversion against the rest of the house, and the Dukes great Father in Law Fitz Allen, Earl of Arundell, a person of the first rank in her affections before these, and some other jealousies made a
separation between them, this noble Lord, and the Lord Thomas Howard, since Earl of Suffolk, standing alone in her grace, the rest in umbrage. Sir Iohn Packington. SIR Iohn Packington was a Gentleman of no mean family, and of form and feature, no way dispiseable, for he was a brave Gentle∣man, and a very fine Courtier, and for the time which he stayed there, (which was not lasting) very high in her grace, but he came in, and went out, and thorough disassiduity drew the Curtain be∣tween himself and the light of her grace, and then death over∣whelmed the remnant, and utterly deprived him of recovery, and they say of him, that had he brought lesse to the Court then he did, he might have carried away more then he brought, for he had a time on it, but an ill husband of opportunity. Lord Hunsdon. MY Lord of Hunsdon was of the Queens neerest Kindred, and on the decease of Sussex, both he, and his sonne took the place of Lord Chamberlain, he was a fast man to his Prince, and firm in his friends and servants, and though he might speak big, and therein would be born out, yet was he not the more dreadfull, but lesse harmfull, and farre from the practise of my Lord of Leicesters instructions, for he was down right, and I have heard those that both knew him well, and had interest in him, say merrily of him, that his Latine, and his dissimulation were both alike, and that his custome of swearing, and obscenity in speaking, made him seem a worse Christian then he was, and a better Knight of the Carpet, then he should be, as he lived in a ruffling time, so he loved sword and buckler men, and such as our Fathers were wont to call men of their hands, of which sort, he had many brave Gentleman that fol∣lowed him, yet not taken for a popular and dangerous person, and this is one that stood amongst the Togati, of an honest stout heart, and such a one (as upon occasion) would have fought for his Prince; and his Country, for he had the charge of the Queens person, both in the Court, and in the Camp at Tilbury.
Rawleigh. SIR Walter Rawleigh was on that (it seems) fortune had pickt out of purpose, of whom to make an example, o to use as her Tennis-Ball, thereby to shew what she could do, for she tost him up of nothing, and to and fro to greatnesse, and from thence down to little more, then to that wherein she found him (a bare Gentleman) not that he was lesse, for he was well descended, and of good allyance, but poore in his beginnings; and for my Lord of Oxfords jest of him (the Iack, and an upstart) we all know, it savours more of emula∣tion, and his humor, then of truth, and it is a certain note of the times, that the Queen in her choice, never took into her favour a meer new man, or a Mechanick, as Commes observes of Lewis the eleventh of , who did serve himself with persons of unknown Parents, such as was Olivr the Barber, whom he created Earl of Dyes, and made him x secretis consilus, and alone in his favour, familiarity: his approaches to the Vniversity, and Innes of Court were the grounds of his improvement, but they were rather excur∣sions, then sieges, or settings down, for he stayed not long in a place, and being the youngest brother, and the house diminished in Patri∣mony, he foresaw his own destiny that he was first to roule (through want and disabilty, to subsist otherwayes) before he could come to a repose, and as the stone doth by long lying, gather mosse: he first exposed himself to the Land service of Ireland, (a ) which then did not yeild him food and rayment, (for it was ever very poore) nor had he patience to stay there, (though shortly after he came thither again) under the command of my Lord Grey▪ but with his own Colours flying in the field, having in the interim cast a new chance, both in the Low-Countries, and in a voyage to Sea; and if ever man drew vertue out of necessity, it was he, therewith was he the great example of industry, and though he might then have taken that of the Merchant to himself,  mar▪ pr terras, currt mector ad Indos, He might also have said, and truely with the Phylosopher, Omnia mea mecum porto: For it was a long time before he could brag of more then he carried at his back, and when he got on the winning side, it was his commendation, that he took pains for it, and under∣went many various adventures for his after perfection, and before he came into the publike note of the world: and it may appear how he came up (per ardua) Per varios casus per t  reunt▪ not pulled up by chance, or by any gentle admittance of Fortune, I will
briefly describe his native parts, and those of his own acquiring, which were the hopes of his rising. He had in the outward man, a good presence, in a handsome and well compacted person, a strong naturall wit, and a better judge∣ment, with a bold, and plausable tongue, whereby he could set out his parts to the best advantage, and to these he had the ajuncts of some generall learning, which by diligence he enforced to a great augmentation, and perfection; for he was an indefatigable Reader, whether by Sea or Land, and none of the least observers both of men, and the times, and I am confident, that among the second causes, of his grouth, that variance between him, and my Lord Grey, in his descent into lan, was a principall, for it drew them both over to the Councell Table, there to plead their cause, where (what advantage he had in the cause I know not) but he had much the bet∣ter, in the telling of his tale, and so much, that the Queen and the Lords, took no slight mark of the man, and his parts, for from thence he came to be known, and to have a cesse to the Queen, and the Lords, and then we are not to doubt how such a man would comply, and learn the way of progression, and whether or no my Lord of Leicester had then cast in a good for him, to the Queen which would have done no harme, I do not determine: but true it is, he had gotten the Queens ear at a trice, and she began to be taken with his elocution, and loved to hear his reasons, to her demands, and the truth is she took him for a kinde of Oracle, which nettled them all, yea those that he relyed on, began to take this his suddain favour for an Allarum, and to be sensible of their own supplantation, and to project his, which made him shortly after sing, Fortune my soe, &c. So that finding his favour declining, and falling into a recesse, he un∣dertook a new perigrination to leave that Tera ifirma of the Court, for that of the Warres, and by declining himself, and by absence to expell his, and the passion of his enemies, which in Court, was a strange device of recovery, but that he knew, there was some ill office done him, that he durst not attempt to minde any other wayes, then by going aside, thereby to teach envy a new way of forgetful∣nesse, and not so much as to think of him, howsoever he had it alwayes in minde never to forget himself, and his device took so well, that at his return he came in (as Rammes do, by going backward) with the greater strength, and so continued to her last, great in her grace, and Captain of the Guard, where I must leave him, but with this observation, that though he gained much at the Court, yet he took it not out of the Exchequer, or meerly out of the Queens purse, but by his wit, and the help of the Prerogative, for the Queen
was never profuse in the delivering out of her treasure, but payed many, and most of her servants part in money, and the rest with grace, which as the case stood, was taken for good payment, leaving the arreare of recompence due to their merit, to her great Successor, who payed them all with advantage. Grevill. SIR Faulk Grevill, since Lord Brook, had no mean place in her fa∣vour, neither did he hold it for any short tearm, for if I be not de∣ceived, he had the longest lease, and the smoothest time without rub of any of her Favorits; he came to the Court in his youth and prime, or that is the time or never, he vvas a brave Gentleman, and honourably descended from Willoughby Lord Brook, and Admirall to Henry the 7. neither illiterate, for he vvas, as he vvould often pro∣fesse a friend to Sir Philip Sydey, and there are of his now extant some fragments of his poem, and of those times, which do interest him in the Muses, and which shews, the Queens election had ever a noble conduct, and it motions more of vertue and judgement, then of fancy. I finde that he neither sought for, or obtained any great place or preferment in Court, during all the time of his attendance, neither did he need it, for he came thither backt with a plentifull Fortune, which as himself was wont to say, was the better held to∣gether by a single life, wherein he lived and dyed a constant Cour∣tier of the Ladies. Essex. MY Lord of Essex (as Sir Henry Wotton a Gentleman of great parts, and partly of his times, and retinue observes) had his intro∣duction by my Lord of Leicester, who had married his mother, a tye of affinity, which besides a more urgent obligation might have in∣vited his care to advance him, his fortune being then (and through his Fathers infelicity) grown low; but that the sonne of a Lord Ferrers of Charley, Viscount Hartford, and Earl of Essex (who was of the ancient Nobility) and formerly in the Queens good grace, could not have a room in her favour, without the assistance of Leicester, was beyond the rule of her nature, which as I have elsewhere taken into
observation, was ever inclineable to favour the nobility: sure it is, that he no sooner appeared in Court, but he took with the Queen and Courtiers, and I beleeve they all could not choose, but look thorough the Sacrifice of the Father, on his living sonne, whose Image by the remembrance of former passages, was a fresh, (like the bleeding of men murdered) represented to the Court, and offe∣red up as a Subject of compassion to all the Kingdome. There was in this young Lord together with a most goodly person, a kinde of urbanity, or innate curtesie, which both wonne the Queen, and too much took upon the people, to gaze upon the new adopted sonne of her favour: and as I go along, it were not amisse to take into observation too notable quotations: the first was a violent indul∣gency of the Queen, (which incident to old age, where it encoun∣ters with a pleasing and sutable object) towards this Lord, all which argued a none perpetuity, the second was a fault in the object of her grace; my Lord himself, who drew in too fast, like a childe suck∣ing on an over uberous Nurse, and had there been a more decent decorum observed in both, or either of those, without doubt, the unity of their affections, had been more permanent, and not so in and out as they were, like an instrument ill tuned, and lapsing to discord. The greater errour of the two (though unwillingly) I am con∣strained to impose on my Lord of Essex, or rather on his youth, and none of the least of his blame, on those that stood Sentinels about him, who might have advised him better, but that like men in∣toxicated with hopes, they likewise had suckt in with the most, and of their Lords receipt, and so like Caesars would have all or none, a rule quite contrary to nature, and the most indulgent parents, who though they may expresse more affection to one in the abundance of bequests: yet cannot forget some Legacies, just distributives, and dividents to others, of their begetting; and how hatefull partiallity proves, every dayes experience tells us, out of which common con∣sideration might have framed to their hands a maxime of more dis∣cretion for the conduct and management of their now graced Lord and Master. But to omit that of infusion, and to do right to truth, my Lord of Essx (even of those that truly loved and honoured him, was noted for too bold an ingrosser, both of fame and favour, and of this (without offence to the living, or treading on the sacred urne of the dead) I shall present a truth, and a passage yet in memory. My Lord Mouy (who was another childe of her favour) being newly come to Court, and then but Sir Charles luns (for my Lord
William his Elder Brother, was then living) had the good fortune one day to runne very well a Tilt, and the Queen therewith was so well pleased, that she sent him in token of her favour, a Queen at Chesse of gold richly ennameled, which his servants had the next day fast∣ned on his Arme, with a Crymson ribband, which my Lord of Essex as he passed through the Privy Chamber, espying, with his cloak cast under his Arme, the better to commend it to the view, enquired what it was, and for what cause there fixed, Sir Foulk Grevill told him, that it was the Queens favour, which the day before, and after the Tilting she had sent him, whereat my Lord of Essex in a kinde of emulation, and as though he would have limited her favour, said now I perceive, every fool must have a favour, This bitter and pub∣likely affront, came to Sir Charles Bluts eare, who sent him a chal∣lenge, which was accepted by my Lord, and they met neer Marry∣bone Park, where my Lord was hurt in the thigh, and disarmed; the Queen missing the men, was very curious to learn the truth, and when at last, it was whispered out, she swore by Gods death, it was fit that some one or other should take him down, and teach him bet∣ter manners, otherwise there would be no rule with him: and here I note the innition of my Lords friendship, with Mountoy, which the Queen her self did then conjure. Now for fame, we need not go farre, for my Lord of Essex having borne a grudge to Generall Norris, who had (unwittingly) offered to undertake the action of Britain with fewer men, then my Lord had before demanded, on his return with victory, and a glorious report of his valour, he was then thought the onely man for the Irish Warre, wherein my Lord of Essex so wrought, by despising the number, and quality of Rebels, that Norris was sent over with a scanted force, joy∣ned with the reliques of the veterane Troops of Britain, of set pur∣pose (as it fell out) o ruine Norris, and the Lord Burows, by my Lords procurement sent▪ his heels, and to command in chief, and to con∣fine Norris onely to his Government at Munser, which brake the great heart of the Generall, to see himself undervalued, and undermined by my Lord and Burrows, which was as the Proverb speaks it, Imber∣bes docere senes. My Lord Burrows, in the beginning of his persecution dyed, where∣upon the Queen was fully bent to have sent over Mountioy, which my Lord of Essex utterly disliked, and opposed vvith many reasons, and by arguments of contempt against Mountioy, his then professed friend and familiar, so predominant vvere his vvords, to reap the honour of closing up that Warre, and all other. Novv the vvay being opened and plained by his ovvn Workman∣ship,
and so handled that none durst appear to stand for the place, at last, vvith much ado, he obtained his ovvn ends, and vvithall his fatall destruction, leaving the Queen and the Court (vvhere he stood firm, and impregnable in her grace) to men that long had sought, and vvatcht their times to give him the trip, and could never finde any opportunity, but this of his absence, and of his ovvn creation, and these are the true observations of his Appetite, and inclinations, vvhich vvere not of any true proportion, but carried and transported vvith an over desire, and thistines after fame, and that deceitfull fame of popularity, and to help on his Catastrophe: I observe like∣vvise tvvo sorts of people, that had a hand in his fall, the first vvas the Souldiery, vvhich all flockt unto him, as foretelling a mortality, and are commonly of blunt, and too rough Counsells, and many times dissonant from the time of the Court, and the State; the other sort vvere of his family, his servants, and his ovvn creatures, such as vvere bound by the rules of safety, and obligations of fidelity to have looked better to the steering of that Boat, wherein they them∣selves were carried, and not have suffered it to float and runne on ground, with those empty Sailes of Fame and Tumor of popular applause, me thinks one honest man or other, that had but the office of brushing his cloaths, might have whispered in his ear, my Lord look to it, this multitude that followes you, will either devoure you, or undo you; strive not to rule, and over rule all, for it will cost hot water, and it will procure envy, and if needs your genius must have it so, let the Court, and the Queens presence, be your station: but as I have said, they had suckt too much of their Lords milk, and in∣steed of withdrawing, they blew the Coals of his ambition, and in∣fused into him too much of the Spirit of glory: yea, and mixed the goodnesse of his nature with a touch of revenge, which is ever ac∣companied with a destiny of the same fate, and of this number there were some of insufferable natures about him, that towar is his last, gave desperate advice, such as his integrity abhorred, and his fidelity forbad, amongst whom Sir Henry ottn notes (without injury) his Secretary Cuffe, a vileman, and of a perverse nature, I could also name others, that when he was in the right course of recovery, and settling to moderation, would not suffer a recesse in him, but stirred up the dregs of those rude humors, which by time, and his affliction, out of his own judgement he sought to repose, or to give them all a vomit: and thus I conclude this noble Lord, as a mixture between prosperity, and adversity, once the childe of his great Mistris favour, but the sonne of Bellona. Buckhurst.
MY Lord of Buckhurst, was of the noble House of the Sackvills, and of the Queens consanguinity, his Father was Sir Richard Sackvill, or as the people then called him, Fill-sack, by reason of his great wealth, and the vast Patrimony which he left to this his sonne, whereof he spent in his youth the best part, untill the Queen by her frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of his profusion, he was a very fine Gentleman of person, and indowments both of art and nature, both without measure magnificient, till on the turn of his humour, and the allay that his yeers, and good Councells had wrought upon those immoderate courses of his youth, and that height of spirit, inherent to his House: and then did the Queen as a most juditious, and indulgent Prince, when she saw the man, grow stayed, and settled, give him her assistance, and advanced him to the Treasureship, where he made amends to his house, for his mispent time, both in the increasment of estate and honour, which the Queen conferred on him, together with the opportunity to remake himself, and thereby to shew that this was a childe, that should have a share in her grace, and a taste of her bounty. They much commend his elocution, but more the excellency of his pen, for he was a Scholler, and a person of a quick dispatch (faculties, that yet runne in the bloud) and they say of him, that his Secretaries did little for him, by the way of inditement, wherein they could seldome please him, he was so facet and choice in his phrase, and style, and for his dis∣patches, and the content he gave to Suitors, he had a decorum sel∣dome since put in practise; for he had of his attendants that took into rowl, the names of all Suitors, with the date of their first adresses, and these in their order had hearing, so that a fresh man, could not leap over his head, that was of a more ancient edition, except in the urgent affaires of State. I finde not that he was any wayes insnared in the factions of the Court, which were all his times strong, and in every mans note the Howards and the cills of the one part, my Lord of Essex, &c on the other part, for he held the Staff of the Treasury fast in his hand, which once in the yeer made then all beholding to him, and the truth is (as he was a wise man, and a stout) he had no reason to be a partaker: for he stood sure in bloud, and in grace, and was wholly intentive to the Queens service, and such were his abilities, that she received assiduous proofes of his sufficiency, and it hath been thought, that she might have more cunning instruments, but none of a more strong judgement and con∣fidence
in his wayes, which are symptomes of magnanimity and fidelity, whereunto methinks this Motto hath some kinde of reference, aut nunq iam tentes aut perfice. As though he would have charactered in a word the Genius of his House, or exprest somewhat of an higher inclination, then lay within his compasse, That he was a Courtier, is apparent, for he stood alwayes in her eye and favour. Lord Mountjoy. MY Lord Mountioy was of the ancient Nobility, but utterly de∣ceived in the support thereof, Patrimony, through his Grand∣fathers excesse in the action of Bullen, his Fathers vanity in the search of the Philosophers stone, and his Brothers untimely prodigalities, all which seemed by a joynt conspiracy to ruine the house, and alto∣gether to annihilate it: as he came from Oxford, he took tho Inner-Temple in his way to Court, whither no sooner came, but (without asking) he had a pretty strange kinde of admission, which I have heard from a discreet man, of his own, and much more of the secrets of those times, he was then much about twenty yeers of age, of a Brown-hair, a sweet face, a most neat Composure, and tall in his person, the Queen was then at White-hall, and at dinner, whither he came to see the fashion of the Court the Queen had soon found him out, and with a kinde of an affected frown, asked the Lady Carer what he was, she answered she knew him not, insomuch as an inquiry was made from one to another, who he might be, till at length, it was told the Queen, he was Brother to the Lord William Mountioy, this inquisition with the eye of Majesty fixed upon him, (as she was wont to do, and to dant men she knew not) stirred the bloud of this young Gentleman, insomuch as his colour came and went, which the Queen observing, called him unto her, and gave him her hand to kisse, incouraging him with gratious words, and new looks, and so diverting her speech to the Lords, and Ladies, She said, that she no sooner observed him, but that she knew there was in him some noble Bloud, with some other expressions of pitty towards his House, and then again demanding his name, She said, fail you not to come to the Court, and I will be think my self how to do you good; and this was his inlet, and the beginnings of his grace, where it fals into confidera∣tion, that though he wanted not wit and courage, for he had very fine atractions, and being a good peece of a Scholler, yet were they ac∣companied with the retractives of bashfulness, and a naturall modesty (which as the toan of his house, & the ebbe of his fortune then stood,
might have hindred his progression, had they not been reinforced▪ by the infusion of Soveraign favour, and the Queens gratious in∣vitation. And that it may appear how low he was, and how much that heretique necessity, will work in the dejection of good spirits, I can deliver it with assurance, that his exhibition was very scant untill his Brother dyed, which was shortly after his admission to the Court, and then was it no more then a thousand Marks er annum, wherewith he lived plentifully in a fine way and garb, and without any great sustentation, during all her times, and as there was in his nature a kinde of backwardnesse, which did not befriend him, nor suite with the motion of the Court, so there was in him an incina∣tion to Armes, with a humour of travelling, and gadding abroad, which had not some wise men about him laboured to remove, and the Queen her self laid in her commands, he would (out of his na∣turall propension) have marred his own market, for as he was grown by reading (whereunto he was much adicted) to the theory of a Souldier, so was he strongly invicted by his genius, to the acquain∣tance of the practique of the Warre, which were the causes of his excursions, for he had a Company in the Low-Countries, from whence he came over with a Noble acceptance of the Queen, but somewhat restlesse, in honourable thoughts he exposed himself again, and again, and would presse the Queen with the pretences of visit∣ing his Company so often, that at length he had a flat deniall, and yet he stole over with Sir Iohn Norris, into the action of Britain, (which was then a hot and active Warre) whom he would alwayes call his Father, honouring him above all men, and ever bewayling his end, so contrary he was in his esteem, and valuation of this great Com∣mander to that of his friend, my Lord of Essex, till at last the Queen began to take his decessions for contempts, and confined his residence to the Court, and her own presence, and upon my Lord of Essex fall (so confident she was in her own Princely judgement, and opinion she had conceived of his worth and conduct) that she vvould have this noble Gentleman, and none other, to finish, and bring the Irish Warre to a propitious end: for it vvas a propheticall speech of her ovvn, that it vvould be his fortune, and his honour to cut the thred of that fatall rebellion, and to bring her in peace to the grave, vvhere she vvas not deceived, for he atchieved it, but vvith much pains, and carefulnesse, and not vvithout the fears, and many jealousies of the Court, and times, vvherevvith the Queens age, and the malignity of her setting times vvere repleat, and so I come to his dear friend in Court, Master Secretary Cecill, vvhom in his long absence from Court, he adored as his Saint, and Courted for his onely Mecenas,
both before and after his departure from Court, and during all the times of his command in Ireland, vvell knovving that it lay in his povver, and by a vvord of his mouth to make or marre him. Cecill. SIR Robert Cecill, since Earl of Salisbury, vvas the sonne of the Lord Burleigh and in the inheritor of his vvisedome, and by degrees, Successor of his places and favours, though not of his Lands, for he had Sir Thomas Cecill his elder brother, since created Earl of Exe∣te, he vvas first Secretary of State, then Master of the Wards, and in the last of her raign came to be Lord Treasurer, all vvhich vvere the steps of his Fathers greatnesse, and of the honour he left to his House. For his person he vvas not much beholding to nature, though somevvhat for his face, vvhich vvas the best part of his outside, but for his inside, it may be said, and vvithout soloecisme, that he vvas his Fathers ovvn sonne, and a pregnant proficient in all discipline of State: He vvas a Courtier from his Cradle, (vvhich might have made him betimes) yet at the age of tvventy and upvvards (he vvas much short of his after proof, but exposed, and by change of climate he soon made shovv, vvhat he vvas, and vvould be, he lived in those times vvherein the Queen had most need, and use of men of vvaight, and amongst able ones, this vvas a chief, as having his sufficiency from his instructions that begat him, the tutorship of the times, and Court, which were then the Academies of Art and cunning, for such was the Queens condition from the tenth or twelfth of her raigne, that she had the happinesse to stand up (whereof there is a former intimation) though invironed with more enemies, and assaulted with more dangerous practises, then any Prince of her times, and of many ages before, neither must we in this her preservation attri∣bute to much to humane pollices, for that God in his omnipotent providence, had not onely ordained those secundary means as in∣struments of the work, but by an evident manifestation, that the same worke which she acted, was a well pleasing service of his owne, out of a peculiar care had decreed the protection of the work-Mistris, and thereunto added his abundant blessing upon all, and whatsoever she undertook, which is an observation of satisfacti∣on to my self, that she was in the right, though to others now breath∣ing under the same form, and frame of her Government, it may not seem an animadversion of any worth, but I leave them to the perill of their own folly. And so again to this great Master of State, and
the staffe of the Queens declinning age, who though his little crook∣ed person could not promise any great supportation, yet it carryed thereon a head, and a headpeece of a vast content, and therein it seems nature was so diligent to compleat one, and the best part about him, as that to the perfection of his memory, and intellectualls, she took care also of his sences, and to put him in  oculos, or to pleasure him the more borrowed of Argns so to give unto him a pro∣spective sight, and for the rest of his sensitive vertues, his predecessor Walsingham had left him a receipt, to smell out what was done in the conclave, and his good old Father, was so well seen in the Mathe∣matickes, as that he could tell you throughout all Spain, every part, every Ship, with their burthens, whither bound with preparation, what impediments for diversion, of enterprises, Councells, and re∣solutions, and that we may see (as in a little Map) how docible this little man was; I will present a taste of his abilities. My Lord of Devonshir (upon the certainty the Spaniard would invade Ireland with a strong Army) had written very earnestly to the Queen and the Coun∣cell, for such supplies to be timely sent over, that might enable him to march up to the Spaniard, if he did land, and follow on his pro∣secution against the Rebels. Sir Robert Cecill, (besides the generall dispatch of the Councell, as he often did) Wrote this in private, for these two began then to love dearly. My Lord, Out of the abundance of my affection, and the care I have of your well doing, I must in private put you out of doubt, (for I fear, I know you cannot be otherwise sensible then in the way of honour) that the Spaniard will not come unto you this yeer, for I have it from my own, what preparations are in all his parts, and what he can do, for be confident, he beareth up a reputation by seeming to embrace more then he can gripe, but the next yeer be assured he will cast over unto you, some forelorne hopes, which how they may be reinforced beyond his present ability, and his first in∣tention, I cannot, as yet make any certain judgement; but I beleeve out of my intelligence, that you may expect their landing in Munster, and the more to distract you, in seve∣rall places, as at Kings-Sail, Beer-haven, Baltimore,
where you may be sure (coming from Se) they will first for∣tifie, and learn the strength of the Rebels, before they dare take the field, howsoever (as I know you will not) lessen your care, neither your defences, and whatsoever lyes within my power to do you, and the publike service, rest thereof assured. And to this I would ad much more, but it may (as it is) suffice to present much, as his abilities in the pen, that he was his crafts Ma∣ster in forraign intelligence, and for domestique affairs, as he was one of those that sate at the stern to the last of the Queen, so was he none of the least in skill, and in the true use of the Compasse, and so I shall onely vindicate the scandall of his death, and conclude him, for he departed at Saint Margarets neer Marlborough, in his return from the Bath, as my Lord Viscount Cranborne, my Lord Clifford his Sonne, and Sonne in Law, my self, and many more can witnesse, but that the day before he sounded in the way, vvas taken out of the Litter, and laid into his Coach, vvas a truth, out of vvhich that false∣hood, concerning the manner of his death, had its derivation, though nothing to the purpose, or to the prejudice of his vvorth. Vere. SIR Francis Vere was of the ancient, and the most noble extract of the Earls of Oxford, and it may be a question, whether the nobility of his house, or the honour of his atchievements, might most com∣mend him, but that we have an authentique rule to decide the doubt, Nam genus & proavos, & quae non ecimus ipsi Vixa nostra voco. For though he vvere an honourable slip of that ancient Tree of no∣bility (which was no disadvantage to his vertue) yet he brought more glory to the name of Vere then he took of Bloud, from the Family. He vvas amongst the Queens svvord-men, inferiour to none, but superiour to many, of vvhom it may be said, to speak much of him, vvere the vvay to leave out something that might adde to his praise, and to forget more that could adde to his honour. I finde not, that he came much to the Court, for he lived almost perpetually in the Camp, but vvhen he did, no man had more of the Queens favour, and none lesse envyed, for he seldome troubled it vvith the jealousie and allarums of supplantation, his vvay vvas another sort of under∣mining, they report that the Queen (as she loved Martiall men)
would Court this Gentleman, as soon as he appeared in her pre∣sence, and surely he was a Souldier of great worth, and commanded thirty yeers in the service of the States, and twenty yeers, over the English in chief, as the Queens Generall, and he that had seen the battail of Newport might there best have taken him, and his noble Brother, my Lord of Tilbury to the life. Worceser. MY Lord of Worcester I have here put last, but not least in the Queens favour, he was of the ancient and noble Bloud of the , and of her Grandfathers line, by the Mother, which the Queen could never forget, especially where there was a concunency of old Bloud with fidelity, a mixture which ever sorted with the Queens nature, and though there might appear something in this House, which might avert her grace, (though not to speak of my Lord himself, but with due reverence and honour) I mean contrariety or suspition in religion, yet the Queen ever respected this House, and principally this noble Lord, whom she first made Master of the Horse, and then admitted of her Councell of State; in his youth (part whereof he spent before he came to reside at Court) he was a very fine Gentleman, and the best Horseman and Tilter of the times, which were then the manlike and noble recreations of the Court, and such as took up the applause of men, as well as the praise and commendation of Ladies, and when yeers had abated these exercises of honour, he grew then to be a faithfull and profound Councellor, and as I have placed him last, so was he the last liver of all the Ser∣vants of her favour, and had the honour to see his renowned Mistris, and all of them laid in the places of their rest, and for himself, after a life of a very noble and remarkable reputation, he dyed rich, and in a peaceable old age, a fate, (that I make the last, and none of the slightest observations) which befell not many of the rest, for they expired like unto lights blown out, with the snuff stinking, not commendably extinguished, and with offence to the standers by. And thus have I delivered up this my poore assay, a little draught of this great Princesse, and her times, with the Servants of her State, and favour, I cannot say, I have finished it, for I know how defective and imperfect it is, as limbed onely in the originall nature, not with∣out the active blemishes, and so left it as a task fitter for remote times, and the sallyes of some bolder Pensill to correct that which is amisse, and draw the rest up to life, as for me to have endeavoured
it, I took it to consideration how easily I might have dasht in too much of the strain of pollution, and thereby have defaced that little which is done, for I professe I have taken care so to master my Pen, that I might not (ex animo, or of set purpose) discolour truth, or any of the parts thereof, otherwise then in concealment. Happily there are some which will not approve of this modesty, but will censure me for pusillanimity, and with great cunning Artists attempt to draw their line further out at large, and upon this of mine, which may (with somewhat more ease) be effected for that the frame is ready made to their hands, and then happily I could draw one in the midst of theirs, but that modesty in me forbids the defacements of men departed, whose posterity yet remaining, injoyes the merit of their vertues, and do still live in their honour: and I had rather in∣curre the censure of abruption, then to be conscious, and taken in the manner of sinning by eruption, and of trampling on the graves of persons at rest, which living, we durst not look in the face, nor make our addresses to them, otherwise then with due regards to their honours, and renown to their Vertues. FINIS.
