A WORD in due SEASON to the Ranting Royalists, & the Rigid Presbiterians. By a Persdn wholly Disinteressed in any of the late, or present Factions. READER, I thought good to give thee notice, that this is the true Coppy of this small Tract, the intent of the Author being more for the publick good then his own private gain; and whereas a Coppy was intercepted by some underhand-dealing of supposed friends (now published in a sheet and a half) it is a false Coppy, and by him disowned. Gentlemen, IT is too manifest, That, in the first War, some of you  Outragious Royalists) did more prejudice the KING your Master, then the Swords of his Enemies; many of you brought more Scandall on Him, then their tongues; And as Divines tell us, It was onely Judas that Betrayed, nor Pilate that Condemned, nor the Jews that Buffeted our Saviour, but every presumptuous sinner acted, and still acts his Part, in the Tragedie: so by Gods just Permission, and for our deserved Punishment, your Exorbitaces (I fear) conspired with the malice of others, in bringing that sa∣cred and innocent head to the Scaffold: What odium brought you upon his Actions? What a jealousie upon his Counsels? Nay, what contempt upon His Person and Authority? The worst of their Proceedings from thence received, (I will not say, Justice) nor scarce Colour; but sure I am, that what pretence they had, they borrowed of you: Otherwise, his Innocency fighting with Arms (Charity binds me to believe in his judgement) purely defensive, and with fre∣quent Sollicitations pursuing Peace, would either have prevailed with the Par∣liament for an Accommodation, or left them generally condemned, as mali∣cious Contrivers, and obstinate Continuers of the WAR, whereby most of the good People of England, but especially of London, and the Associated Counties, would soon have been undeceived, as they have since been by late and wofull experience; for it is well known, that many (then) the fiercest Zealots for our unhappy Reformation, never hated the Person of their Soveraign, nor envied his just Power, but sincerely loved him, and heartily embraced his Government; yet being first terrified by your threats, and exasperated with your Provocations, were, afterwards, by their factious Teachers and Ring∣leaders, too easily cheated of their Loyalty, and led captive, as it were, into meer Sedition, under the specious but State pretence of removing evil Coun∣sellours, and rescuing his Majesties Authority and Person (as they were told) out of the hands of a desperate Crew, which abused his goodness and facility: The truth whereof, doth since evidently appear, by their frank confession, hearty contrition, and late most effectual endeavours, with sober and generous Actions, to cancel the memory of their former errors, and satisfie the World (at least the judicious) they never sinned presumptuously; for insolent and ma∣licious Treason commonly fetters the soul, and ends in the gangrene of a de∣spairing and implacable Guilt; whereas, their desire to trust that Prince, whom once they disobliged, savours, though of much Errour at first, yet now of more Ingenuity, and must be construed to proceed onely from such soundness of heart, and clearness of spirit, as by good men ought to be highly cherished; and perhaps, far better esteemed, then the meer ostentation of perseverance in pretended Loyalty, but real Animosity; Wherefore, Gentlemen, in true friend∣ship to you, (whom I would willingly, in part, excuse, upon the score of your great suffering, and oppression, which transports even wise men) but especially, in zeal of his service, whom we all professe equally to desire, give me leave without offence, a little to expostulate with you. Do you think it a small matter, That after a long consumption of our blood and spirits in a civil War, or a Peace, more hostile then it, God hath, at length, miraculously afforded us a possibility of Settlement. That after a tedious night of Egyptian darkness and bondage, God hath given you a glimpse, and indeed as yet, but a glimpse of hope, That you, as Englishmen, may as in due time, with others, enjoy your birthright, (viz.) an Equal Protection and Benefit of the Law; and will nothing, now, already, content you but absolute Domi∣nion, and to have all things prostrate at your feet? Is this a fitting return of thankfulness to God, for your deliverance begun, or a probable means of pre∣vailing with him, to continue and perfect his mighty works? Have you so soon forgotten your Sequestrations, Prisons, and Scaffolds? Can you remember no sins of yours, that entitled you to those Punishments, or might modestly oblige you, at least to confesse the justice of God, in the unjustice of Men; but must all your sufferings be imputed to meet supererogation and glorious Mar∣tyrdom? Was it a Crime, unpardonable, in your adversaries, as you pretend, to rebel, though many of them transgressed, more out of ignorance, then con∣tempt of their Duty; and is it no fault in you, who glory in being so Orthodox, to breath out Violence, cherish your lusts, and steep your souls in Revenge? Are you of the Nature of those Elements, and which, in our Provervial dialect, are good Servants, but ill Masters, and which, if not confin'd, will drown and devour all? Were you fatally design'd either to be Slaves, or Tyrants, Gi∣beonites, or Bahawes? Are you like those in Bedlam, not to be tamed but with hunger and stripes? Can you imagine, the lofty pretences of a Party, which hath been so often foyled, so long supprest, so much suspected, will con∣sist with the satisfaction of others more considerable, the Settlement of the Nation, the Exigence of Affairs? Or can you ever hope to carry it with a high hand by your silly Rhodomontado's? Hath not experience yet made you sensible, That the People of this Nation, haying tasted the forbidden fruit, are now become sinfully wise; That their eyes being indeed opened, but with∣all their natures vitiated, and wills depraved, they are quite fallen from their primitive innocency, so as I fear, the KING, if restored, must buckle to inconveniences, and Reign, at least, for some time, rather as a Probationer then a Prince? Were not some of you drinking your late Masters health, Whilst his Cause, nay, perhaps, himself was bleeding his last? Have not you since served his Son, much at the same rate, and with like success? Will you never learn to govern your Passions, to allay your Cups, or turn, if not truly Virtuous, yet ordinarily Discreet, so at least, as not to fall miserably into the the pitty of your Friends, the Scorn of your Enemies, and Obloquie of the People: That a Righteous cause may no more be blasted with your Scandals, Party (which certainly hath no Peer for constancy, justice, and modesty) deci∣mated, as it were again in its reputation, for the Enormities, of a few who being (God be thanked) of your number? Do you not know, how the KING disownes you, the People dislike yov, our Friends blush for you, and the Enemies of your quiet now make use of your exorbitances or treasuries (a be∣lief whereof your irrational Ranting extorts from me) to obstruct a lawful and hapgy Settlement. And if (which God in mercy prevent) now in this Crysis of our hopes, and fears, through your folly and frenzie (I wish I could forbear to say, some of your falshood) the hands of true Englishmen should be weakned, the Factious exasperated, the jealous alarm'd (though falsly) the tender sprouts of Loyalty nipped and discouraged, so that our hopes and endeavours should prove abortive, and your poor Countrey return to its thraldom, would not the Present Age and Posterity, have cause to curse you, more then any of our late Tyrants and Taskmasters? And who indeed would then, be accounted such Traytors, and firebrands, as you? However, think seriously, if you can, whether (you persisting) the Nation (now enclin' to vo∣miting) will not spue you you out amongst the Phanataticks, as a morsel, which if it were swallowed, can never be digested, but must oppresse nature, putrifie in the stomach, and poyson the blood; in fine, a meer Faction, and an Extreme, no lesse nauseous and dangerous, then the Rump it self. And you my good Friends of the Presbyterian Party, know, that you are generally distinguished into Two Classes, (viz.) Moderate and Rigid. You of the first rank are by all sober men acknowledged, now, to be of the best sort of Englishmen-men, not differing (materially at least? from the Moderate Royalist, Generous Assertors of our Liberties, stout Oppugners of encroach∣ing (and consequently) Maintainers of Just Prerogative; above all, you are considered as Persons, that will modestly acquiesce in Freedom of Parliament, the onely cure proper to our Distempers. For we suppose your Moderation, which to you was natural, cannot but be greatly improved, by your Experi∣ence, since many, even the Principal of you, having been for your Loyalty, Temper, forcibly excluded from the Government, more then Eleven years, have thereby, had leasute to reflect on Errours, to observe passages, and to design Expedients, without the Partiality of Gamesters; Great reason there∣fore, we have, to promise our selves, That you, who have not owely, with others, seen, and felt the fatal consequences of the Swords interposing in our Laws, but more signally, in your Persons, suffered those memorable insolencies and indignities from Red-coats, will be for ever most tenderly concerned for the honour of Parliaments, and careful never to encourage, much lesse (un∣der any pretence, how specious soever) your selves to practice that Violence, which you have so justly and notably branded in others, when exercised on you; And this honest Principle, wherein the Sober Royalists shake hands with you, I take for the onely basis, upon which, we can possibly be setled. But for you, of the other sort, (viz.) The Violent and Rigid, I must tell you Plainly; You are esteemed, but a kinde of Franticks, and very paltry ones; In your Policy, Pedantick, in your Justice, Narrow and Mechanick, sel∣vish in Conversation, Waspish in Argument or Debate, Perverse in Business, Excencrick in your Motions, and true to no Principle; You are observed not to walk by the Golden rule of doing as you weuld be done to; nor think your selves concerned in that Sacred precept, of doing no evil, that good may fol∣low; Per fas, aut nefas, and Flectere si nequeo superos, are no small part of your Decalogue. Waving therefore the design of convincing your Judgments, as impertinent, if not impossible, give me leave to acquaint you, That the Nation hath hither∣to seen little of you to enamour then; That the most extravigant of Sectaries are more grateful to us, then you, in regard they allow others the same freedom they arrogate to themselves; That the Discipline of Geneva is every where cnured as a Government by Princes justly suspected and feared, by Nobility scorned, acd by the People of England loathed; That it will never be settled here, by fair means, nor surely, I hope by foul, or if it be, it must come like Mahomet, with a Turkish Cimitar in its hand, and desolation at its heels: You may therefore do well for our sakes, and your own, to desist from so hopelesse a pursuit, and content yovr selves with the Liberty of Christians and English∣men, contending for a Dominion, so distastful to all but your selves; However I beseech you refrain your factious and unworthy Arts, in spreading and fomen∣ting those Calumnies, which your selves know to have no other ground then the levity of a few Malecontents, no deeper root then the Tavern, not any Reputa∣tion, but what you delight to give them, and which would vanish of their own accord, like froth or bubbles, if you were not as ready to uphold, as industrious to propagate discord; as the indiscretest Cavaliers are apt, (and alas, too apt they are) to vent their follies. Finally, You Churchen, whether of the Classical or Episcopal Judgement, Remember you are Ministers of the Gospel, not of the State: For which pur∣pose, our pious Lawes have provided you a peculiar Maintenance to depend on no man, have both Sequestred you from Publick Offices, and exempted you from Civil duties: Thrust not then your Sickles into uny othea Harvest, Act not the parts of Newes-mongers and Politicians; You no question struck the first stroke, for our Statesmen turn'd not Preachers till our Preachers turn'd States∣man. It is, surely, high time, you redeem the Credit, you have lost, whether as Evangelists, Christians, or good Citizens; and stop their mouths, who have too much colour to Object, That your Blessings and Curses are like those of Balaam; and that, indeed, you deliver not Christs Ordinances, but your own Passions; wherein, though, perhaps, you may not alwayes ere in the Main, yet, commonly, you transgress, in the measure.
