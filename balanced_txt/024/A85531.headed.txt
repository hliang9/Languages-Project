THE PLOTT And Progresse of the Irish REBELLION. LOoke into all Machavillian Pollicies they first pretend unto a seeming good; as may appeare in the Goverment of Ireland, un∣der the Lord Lievtenant Straford, in his first comming to regulate the sword, with an austere hand of Justice over all, seeming to befriend, and ease the Sub∣jects from a letigious course of Law, and Monopolized the major part of Causes, and reduced them to an Arbitrary Government. 2. The advantage raised unto his Majesty by affording agrea∣ter Revenue for the customes of Ireland, then formerly was given, and so a grant of farming the customes was afforded ('twas said to Sir George Ratclife) the world may be satisfied
for whose use it was, then presently customes were enhanced, of all forts, as Yarne. Tallow, Hide Butter &c. and especially Tobacco from six pence, to two shillings in the pound, by which increased an estate by any unjust exaction from the Subject. 3. In obtaining thirty thousand Arms, Ammunition, Artillery, &c. pretending for the security of the Kingdome, then the con∣fiscating of the lands of Conaught to bring them to the Crowne as also divers other Estats, in that Kingdome, by which it might seeme to his Majesty and the state of England, good service done to the Crowne, it cannot be denied but that the said Lord Lievtenant, shewed himselfe very severe against the Natives, nei∣ther were the British much favoured, when they came under his hand: This is but a preamble for their intended project. Touching matters regulated in the Church it is worth a con∣sideration, what innovations were crept in and in the regulating of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as the High Commission Court, &. 'tis worth observation, that what power the Bishop of Derry, Bramble in clawing and never ending for  not one∣ly his fellow Soveraign Bishops, but also Arch Bishops, to void tennants estats, and enhancing rents nigh the double value what formerly they were, this may conduce o a Romish polli∣cy, to keepe the Subject as poore as may be, that when time serves to inact farther, and impose on them  they please; so the tennants as the Tribe of Jssachar, must eare what Levi would impose on them, in a temporall Government, as also the high Commission Court being so prevalent (that Hillary Tearme last 1643. at Dublin) in which Doctor Harding was censured, to be degraded of his ministeriall function and also of his de∣grees in the Colledge and after to be left to be proceeded a∣gainst at Common Law: the cause alleadged was for maintai∣ning, Blasphemy in the Colledge about foure yeares since, allead∣ging he should declare that 'twas injustice in God to condemne Adam for eating the apple, another charge there was laid a∣gainst
him, for causing a booke to be printed in Dub lin (though he had the approbation of the Arch-Bishop of Dublin) en∣tituled Irelands advocate, being none of his owne worke, but sent by an acquaintance of his from England in manuscript, and he putting it to the presse, with an Epistle Dedicated to Sir Iohn Temple, of his owne framing, in which booke they picke forth treason (as they tearme it) the first exception is be∣cause the Authour is invective against Bishops, the other was in an other place of the booke, giving the Almighty thankes for the severall deliverances that England hath had, from the plots of the Papists, as instancing that of 88. and that of the 5. of November and that of the 4. of Ianuary, at which of the 4. of Ianuary they storme, and inferre, to be treason, interpre∣ting that was the day his Majesty with his attendance went to demand the five members forth of the house of Parliament, and therefore conceived treason, for rancking or comparing that day to the known Papisticall plotts, and for ought as yet is known he is like to loose his life: and the bookes that could be found printed were adjudged by the said high Commission Court, to be burnt by the hand of the hangman; which accor∣dingly was done: This is not the bondage aymed at, but one far deeper the spirituall bondage of the soule; as looke into that Cozen-jerman to plaine Popery, Superstitious and Alter-like Service how it was enforced throughout that Kingdome of Ireland and they that refused, how severely they were handled in the high Commission Court, 'tis two well known, that di∣vers Ministers that refused that way were forced to quit that Kingdome, especially some in the North. Power being once prevalent, both in State and Church, then time served to set forward that Diabolicall plot, for the ruine and destruction of the Protestant Religion in the three King∣domes of England, Scotland, and especially Ireland, and the first practice (as well 'tis observed by the authour of the Booke intituled The Mysterie of iniquitie yet working) Scotland, (not resenting to what the Prelates would have forced in their
Church) tooke Armes to defend their Religion: a Passification was yelded to by his Majestie, till after invited by the Earle of Strafford, and others, to take armes De nove: hee having pre∣pared matters sufficiently in Ireland, pretending against the Scots, and so drew downe an Armie of eight thousand, (of which 'tis well knowne of Officers, and souldiers, there were not nigh one thousand Protestants) to the Scottish shoare, where the inhabitant Scot of that Kingdome of Ireland, was by his Commands disarmed, and Garrisons planted from Strankford to London-Derrie along the shoare-side. Matters then begin∣ning to come to a ripenesse, the Earle of Straford brought with him into that Kingdome of Ireland, at his last going over, one Sir Toby Mathews an arch Jesuite, made him his Comrade, (observed) none was more honoured by him then this grand Jesuite: Now observe how easie a matter it is for a Jesuite once understanding the intent, to state the hearts of other Je∣suites, Friers, Seminaries, &c. and then how easie a mat∣ter, 'tis for them to state the hearts of all their people, and ad∣herents, any man may judge that knoweth any thing. So then if the Lord Strafford did shew himselfe never so great a Tyrant (as certaine hee did) not only to the Natives, but also to the Brittish; the rather to cast a cloud before the State of England then otherwayes; how easie it was for the Jesuites, Priests, &c. to informe the Common people, that hee was for all their good, though hee shewed himselfe otherwayes to them, as time hath brought it forth. Wee may now evidently see, what his Plott (with others was,) as I hope to produce such conducing Circumstances as may satisfie the hearts of all good Christians, for others that are or may bee of the same faction, I leave, for who are blinder then they that will not see. A Minister who lived in the Coun∣ty of Kildare in Ireland, had some Conference with a Popish Priest living not farre from him, who informed the Minister, of a Plott that was contrived beyond Sea against the Protestants in Ireland, relating that the Irish intended to rise shortly, and
that he had seen Letters to that purpose from beyond sea, and that those letters were in such a Closet, with such a Jesuite, in such a mans house, naming every particular; this was about Aprill 1639. The Minister finding the Priest serious, went along with him to the Earle of Straford, to the Castle of Dub∣lin, waited his opportunitie in the Gallerie, and at last presented this Priest to the said Earle, expressing that hee had informed him of a Plott the Papists had against the Protestants; the Earle answered, 'twas some busie-pated knave or other; being urged, he could say much, replyed; what could he say? the Priest be∣ing taken privately by the Earle to the further end of the Gal∣lerie, after halfe an houres space was dismist, there was given him by his Lordships Command, twenty pounds, a horse, and a suite of clothes to conceale the matter, and Commanded never to appeare againe, which according to his Commands was obeyed. Time began to draw on, the Earle of Straford was to re∣turne to England, but before hee went was pleased to expresse, that if ever hee returned to regulate that honourable Sword a∣gaine, hee would leave neither roote, nor branch, of the Scot∣tish Nation in that Kingdome. Well, over hee goeth to the North of England, where hee intended the stroake should be strooke betweene the Armies, it pleased God to prevent, be∣yond the Expectation of men. The Earle was taken notice of, and according to his merit was requited; Is this all? No, as now 'tis evident by the relation of some Irish Jesuites, and o∣thers, that as soone as the stroake was strooke by the Armies, betweene England and Scotland, (which was to be about Mi∣chaelmasse 1640.) the Earle of Straford was to returne for Ireland, then was it, that the Irish Armie being drawn down to the North as aforesaid, was to fall upon all the Inhabitants Scots, and English thereabouts, and so the Irish to fall upon all the English and Scots Protestants in that Kingdome, but not to murther them in such a massacring way, they only were to se∣cure their persons and estates, till further order, and that they
were called to an accompt for their religion, and then refusing, should suffer. Their Plott failing in this particular, the Irish waited on, as amazed, to see the issue of their Earle (as they after tearm'd him) 'twas May following before his head was taken off, and after that, the Irish Armie was disbanded, which was no small vexation to the Irish (as may further appeare in the Irish Remonstrance to his Majestie, that being their sixt grievance) they must then another way to worke, their agents being in England, they waited their return and taking their advantage of the yeare, after Harvest, the 23. of October 1641. began their bloody massacre, Donnagh Mac Guire, the Lord of Eneskillings Uncle, and Hugh Mac Mahoune, the said Lords Secretarie, and chiefe Counsellour affirmed, that they should have begun that time twelve-moneth, had the Lord of Straford returned accor∣ding to expectation; and also they exprest, that there were the like distempers in England, and that Plott was for the three Kingdomes, and had the Castle of Dublin beene taken, they would have sent fourtie thousand men to England. Being op∣posed by the hearer, that he could not beleeve that the Earle had any hand in such a businesse; they affirmed hee had, and was to be Lord of Ireland, as in former ages they had; and that they would not begin when they heard his head was off, but forbore till harvest was in, and nights long, that they might set themselves in a posture of warre. For they well knew how easie it was in Summer, for England and Scotland to send an Armie to qualifie them. Some notice may be taken of the Earles words before hee parted with his head, speaking of a Reformation in Charracters of blood, and that there was a Cloud impending, which since hath proved too true to our wofull experience. (What will not ambitious Machavilians attempt to make them and their posterity great.) Most certaine it is by relation of those that were about the Lord Ambassadour to Spaine, that about Michaelmasse 1640. the Jesuites, Priests, and Friers, in Spaine ex∣pected
to heare newes of the distempers in Ireland, (the Rebel∣lion I meane) upon which the Lord Ambassadour sent to the Court in England, to know the certaintie, returne was made all well and quiet, yet the said Lord Ambassadour stayed in Spaine till about Michaelmasse 1641. all that whole yeare, the Jesuits, Priests, &c. expected daily to heare of disturbance in Ireland: Each particular seriously considered and compared one with another, I beleeve may satisfie any reasonable man, that the said Earle must needs have a hand in the Plott of Ireland; Sir George Ratclife may be so farre taken notice of, that he stormed very much against the Church warden of Saint Warbres Parish in Dublin; for presenting a Masse-house that was newly ere∣cted within foure or five houses of the Castle gate, in which Masse was frequently said, and he Commanded the presentment to be cast forth of the Court, and never could further endure the said Churchwarden. There is no wonder in this, for all men that knew him, might quickly discerne his inclination to that Idolatrous, Babilonian whore. Now, since this massacring act it hath been frequently spo∣ken by the Rebells, that what they did was by Commission, which still they justifie. Let all Christians stand here amazed to behold the cessation of Armes to be granted to such Butcherly Hell-hounds, who have wallowed and embrewed their hands in the destruction of at least two hundred thousand Protestants, of men, women, and children, which will be particularly pro∣ved if occasion be offered. Yet it is reported that there is Brian mac Neale, the Ferry-mans sonne of Strangford in Ireland, who hath assumed the name of O Neale, one of those that at first should have surprized the Castle of Dublin, and who is now made Knight and Barronet, called Sir Brian O Neale, that doth justifie to his Majestie, that there was not above tenne persons destroyed in all Vlster. Againe, their Remonstrance set forth, intituled, A Remonstrance of Grievances presented to his most Excellent Majestie in the behalfe of the Catholicks of Ireland)
wherein the Rebels doe declare, and turne the whole Rebelli∣on on the Protestants, and stand on their own iustification that what Massacries were committed were done by the Eng∣lish. Are not these a people to be had in high estimation, com∣mitting such Acts as they did to stand out in their owne justi∣fication & for any thing I can see as yet like to carry it so. How prevalent the Irish faction is about the Court, is sufficiently apprent, little question their is to be made, of there obtaining a suddaine peace. There is one thing to be taken notice of that when the Lord of Ormond marched forth this last Summer 1643. with foure thousand horse, and foot, kept the randevous at Curr in Kil∣dare, when they might have done good execution against the Enemie were kept above a fortnight in the field and Starved above three hundered of them returned (though they saw the enemies Coulours flying in the field) taking only one poore old Castle not worth a consideration, then after that, they were disperced by Companies (some three thousand of them) into smale Garrisons in the pall, to secure old Castles; a weeke be∣fore the Cessation was concluded the Irish forces both of Lin∣ster Connaught, and Vlster, (they well knowing when to con∣clude the Cessation) joyned together and fell on the said small Garrisons, and destroyed many, and tooke divers prisoners, possest themselves of a great part of Meath which still they in∣ioy. Oh let all Protestants either now open their eyes, or else resolve to undergoe the yoake that they are not, or will not be willing to beare, when it will be to late for them, then to wish I had done this or that &c. May we not now observe in what a Cloud still we are under, though faire shaddows are cast be∣fore our eyes; As that the new Lord Lievtenant Marquesse of Ormond, hath commanded that no Papist shall be either of his retinnue, or of his Companies, in his regiment and Guard, when it may be well observed how forward he is to give way to Papists to be transported into England, to serve against the Protestants, as also tis worth a consideration (that since the
Lord of Stratfords time, and the time that Iames the Pedlar songe downe derry) the second or Alter-like Service, hath beene omitted at Christ-Church in Dublin in the Lord Ju∣stices time, yet now newly revived, since the Marquesse of Ormond received the sword, how neare still they presume to declare themselves, not what they would be at, that bewitched druncken cup of fornication; let notice bee taken likewise of the second Ratclife alias Sir Morris Eustace the chiefe Coun∣sellour of that Kingdome, that in some measure declared him∣selfe, (one may see daylight at a little hole) there was one that had an estate in houses in Dublin, and set them to tennant, the Landlord that set them, hath beene in Rebellion at this time untill the Cessation of armes, then repaired to Dublin, de∣manded his rents, from the tennant and arrerages, for two years past, the tennant answered, that it had beene lesse charge to him to have paid his rent, then to have borne that cease and presse, and billiting of Souldiers as he did, and so declared he was unable to pay his rent, the Landlord threatned to de∣straine, for he observed there was household stuffe left that would discharge the rent and arrerages, the tennant being thus threatned, desired the oppinion of Sir Morris Eustace, and informed him his case, who declared that he was bound to pay his rent, otherwise by the Law of the Land he might be distrained on. This is a hard case that Rebells shall have their rents paid them, and that many hundreds of us Protestants ruin'd (with their wives and children) in their estates by the Rebels, and are daily begging and starving in Dublin, and other parts of that Kingdome (besides those that are forced to flie for succour into other Kingdomes, and no reparation can be thought of, for the keeping them alive, out of their owne estates, enioyed now by the Rebells; whilst our army was on foote (God so blessed our poore handfull of men) that still they had the better of the
enemy, and spoyle was gained to relieve them and others, now we all suffer, and that iustly for dispairing of Gods providence to us; let the authors of the Cessation looke to it; tis but in us to observe, and morne, to see that a Cessation of armes must be yeelded unto such Antichristian infernall Locusts as they are, and no understanding for the Protestant reformed Religion, can be hearkened unto in England, our own men brought from Ireland to be made instruments against our selves; Is not this the depth of a Machavillian mistery, we may observe the provi∣dence of the Almighty on the officers and Souldiers, (that did doe gallant Service against the Irish Rebells) which were sent into England how soone it pleased the Lord to declare, he was not well pleased with theit comming shewing his hand on them at Nantwitch. Now faire oppertunity may the Irish have to playe their af∣ter gaine, as they have sufficiently envited and set forth in print from Waterford. Entituled, Admonissions by the su∣preame Counsell of the confederate Catholicks of Ireland: To all his Majesties faithfull, loyall Subjects of the three King∣domes, of England, Ireland, and Scotland, against a solemne League and Covenant framed by the Malignant party, in the Parliament of England; as also a Declaration of the English Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament wherein they ensite, not only their owne Nation to stand to their Arms of∣fensive and Defensive, but envite them to a timely and a fit prevention; as also envite all Romish Catholicke Kings, to take notice how far they are engaged in it; as much as if they should say to their Countrimen, play your after game, take a fit time to cutt all the rest of the Protestants throats and to en∣vite other Princes to fall upon the Massacring of all the Pro∣testants, within their verdge. Thus we find how active they are at the pen let us looke a little further, & conclude what their intentions are, as doth eve∣dently
appeare by their diligence, in slacking no time to set forward their intended project, how busie they (the Irish) have beene in procuring Armes and Ammunition since the Cessation. Sir Pierce Crosbie, who about the time of Conclud∣ing the Cessation, brought over with him to Waterford, (for the Rebels) five thousand Armes and Ammunition. Againe, the Popes Nuntio (who is there frequent with them (brought over Treasure to maintaine the warre, as is said fiftie thousand pounds. And now lastly, about Candlemas there landed two Agents from Forraign parts, who brought over with them to Waterford store both of Armes and Amunition, and much more is brought daily, though we cannot discover every particular; Doth not this demonstrate unto us their intent, and how cautious they were in the concluding of the Cessation (that proviso) to have liberty to buy Armes, and Ammunition where they pleased, either in that Kingdome, or from Forraigne parts, how frequent they are at Dublin, in buying Armes from the Cutlers at what rate soever, without ay interruption, that a good Sword no Cutler can keepe by him, the Irish Gentrie buy them so fast, and give any rates for them; What advantage is this against us, they arming themselves, and we disarming our selves, by sending our men and Armes, and Artillerie out of that King∣dome to maintaine warre our against our selves, how insolent the Irish Nobilitie and Gentrie, doe now shew themselves against our English Nobilitie and Gentry at Dublin, 'tis apparant, as in the Case betweene the young Lord Moore. and the Lord Tate, as also in the Case betweene Sir Thomas Armstrong, and Captaine Flowre, on one part Protestants; and Cornet Mac Gragh and Routh Papists, of the other part, the Papists taking opportunitie in the streets of Dublin to affront our Protestants, Lords and Gentrie; they doe well to demonstrate unto us, that when their second Plott is to be set in agitation, may in Dub∣lin
begin upon such like Quarrels in the streets, thereby to take occasion for the second cutting of throats, and once being past to flourish it over, and say 'twas some drunken quarrell or other, for at this instant, Dublin may take it selfe, the major part being Irish now in it. To Conclude, now the Scottish Armie are resolved to de∣part from the North of Ireland, as already appeares, three Regiments are wafted over into Scotland, (which maketh still for the Irish) and to bring to a period their Jesuiticall Plott, so as the Irish may the better performe their offer to send away tenne thousand of their chiefe Souldiers, under the Command of experienced Commanders, to keepe the Protestants in Armes in other Kingdomes, either in England or Scotland; Oh! that we might in some measure use the Pollicies of the Antient Romans, or of late Queene Elizabeth of famous Me∣morie did, who when the Spaniards strove to envade England, did afford some aide unto the Hollander to keepe the Spaniards on worke at home, by which she preserved her Kingdomes (un∣der Gods Providence) from being a Seat of warre: So if time∣ly prevented by England and Scotland, to keepe the warre a∣foote in Ireland, to prevent further mischiefe, (which is like to ensue, if the Irish breake forth into other Kingdomes) and so turne the Sword into their owne bosomes: which that wee may, the Lord of Hosts enable us to doe. Here now it is manifest that the Irish have obtained not only their first request desired in their Remonstrance, which was to have one placed in chiefe Authoritie, of Honour and Fortune, approved by His Majestie, and acceptable to the Rebells, (which proveth to be the Marquesse of Ormond) but also the other to have a free Parliament held there, and and an Act of oblivion to be made for their Rebellion; and Poynings Act to be repealed: and there the Rebells to hold their Parliament; which is reported His Majestie hath yeelded unto, by granting
Pardon to the Irish Rebells. Lately, at Oxford Confirmed under the Great Seale of England, for Pardoning all Murders and Robberies whatsoever, and authorizing a new Parliament to be called there according to the Rebells desires, so that now we must expect they will performe their promise to his Majestie in sending ten thousand men and Armes into England; Yet we know there is a King of Kings, that can turne the wis∣dome of the wise into foolishnesse.

A POSTSCRIPT TO THE READER. CHristian Reader be pleased in this trackt to consider the depth of an adversary, that aimes at the destruction of the true Protestant Religion, had the Plott held accor∣ding to their jesuiticall intent, by this time there would have beene few left, to observe for future, their infernall projects, the Al∣mighty who preserved Ioseph from the ma∣licious intent of his brethren (to be under him) the instrument to preserve them from calamity; is the same who will deliver them that trust in him, from that which might prove worse, then the Egyptian Bondage, which every true Christian is bound to endea∣vour a prevention, and to take no exceptions, though they are envited by him that hath beene and is a sufferer (for Christs cause) and his Countreys sake. Tho: Crant.
