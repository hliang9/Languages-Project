A necessary and useful INTRODUCTION. THe Author of this little Book hopes he has served the Publick somewhat better than other Arithmeticians, who have gone before him, for the following Reasons. 1. In that his Method is more plain and easie than that of other Men; and those things which they have left intricate and difficult to be understood, are here made evident by clear Demonstrations, obvious to the meanest capacity.
2. In that his Tables are Calcu∣lated with greater care, and are much more correct than those that have been Published of late years. For instance, all those Tables in Mr. Newton's Book, Printed 1667, are full of Errors and mistakes; and which is very remarkable, the Tables which Mr. Dary has Pub∣lished as his own, are only tran∣scribed out of Mr. Newton's Book, and that with all the Errors, which are so many, that they must needs mislead and discourage either young or old Practitioners from trusting to, or making use of them. In Mr. Clavel's Tables, which seem to be more correct than the others, there will be found many very considerable Errors. As for
instance, if you would know what an Annuity of 600l. to con∣tinue 21 years is worth in ready Money, you will find it there to be but 6058: 08: 11.034, which is too little by 1000l. also if you would know the Present Worth of 60 l. Annuity for the like time (in the same Page that re∣solves the former Question) you will find but 605 : 16 : 10.703, which is less than the truth by 100 l. Whereas in this little Book, by the more than ordinary care and diligence of Mr. John Playford, Printer, (whom I have found the most ingenious and dexterous of any of his Profession, in Printing of Tables, and all sorts of Mathe∣matical Operations) it is presumed
that there will hardly be found one false Figure; but if there should, the Tables are so framed, that what the one does by Multiplication, the other proves by Division, & vice versâ, what∣ever the one performs by Division, the other makes out by Multiplica∣tion to be a truth. 3. Because the Operations accor∣ding to the Rules and Tables of this little Book, where the Sums are great, are much more easie, practi∣cable, and satisfactory, than by Mr. Clavel's Tables; besides that those Tables do not answer very many useful Questions that will daily occur to Men of business.
For Example. He has Tables for the Amount of any Sum to 10000 l. for 365 days, but he has no Tables of Rebate for so many days, which is full as useful as the other, not only in Simple, but also Compound Interest; so that the Practitioner must very often be forced to have recourse to the Logarithms, or other tedious Calculations. 4. Because all the Operations in this Book are performed by DECIMAL ARITHMETICK, which of all other is the most use∣ful and Practicable, when well understood: And in order there∣unto, the Author has here given several Examples, and explained
the respective Operations in such a manner, that any person who does at all understand the Vulgar Arith∣metick, may in one hours time throughly comprehend this. Addition and Subtraction of Decimals. AS for the Operations of Ad∣dition and Subtraction, they are the very same with the Vulgar. For Example. To 375.42 Add 49.32 Sum 424.74.
There must only care be had of setting Unites under Unites, and Fractions under Fractions, in their proper Ranks and Files; as likewise that there be as many places of Fractions in the Total, as are found in either of the Sums, before they are added together. Thus: To 375.42 Add 495.4 Sum 870.82 Or thus: To 375.42 Add 95.03 Sum 470.45
Again, From 870.82 Deduct 495.4 Remainder 375.42 Or, From 470.45 Deduct 95.03 Remainder 375.42
Multiplication of Decimals. Rule. SET one Number over ano∣ther, (making only a Full∣point to Distinguish between whole Numbers and Fracti∣ons) in the very same manner as is none in ordinary Multi∣plication, only when the Pro∣duct is finished, look how many places of Fractions are found, both in the Multiplicand and Multiplicator jointly, just so many must be left in the Pro∣duct.
For Example. To multiply 342.34 by 3.123, place them thus: Explanation. Because in the Multiplicand there are two places of Fractions, and in the Multiplicator three, in all
five; therefore in the Product there must be also five places of Fractions. Thus, Here the Practitioner is to ob∣serve, that the Fraction which is in truth less, is set over the whole Number, which is really greater. But because the Fraction consists of more places, it is set uppermost,
though it is a thing indifferent, for if they were set otherwise, the Product would still be the same. For, Which is the very same as before.
By the same Reason, The Product must evermore be compleated, as to the number of places that are found in both Mul∣tiplicand and Multiplicator.
An excellent Method of Con∣tracting a Long Multipli∣cation. 1. IN the first place, wherever a Multiplication consists of above three places, the Author does recommend to all Practitioners (as a thing which he has sufficiently experienced to be the most safe and easie) to make use of a Tariffa, or Table of Multiplication for the Multiplicand: And though it may and will seem at the first view to be more tedious, yet it will be found to be the shortest of all other ways whatsoever, being per∣formed by Addition only, and less
subject to error; and not only so, but whereas all other Operations of Multiplication do extreamly distort the Eyes by looking sted∣fastly upon Figures placed Diago∣nally, by this Tariffa the Eye looks on them always in a streight Line, and no otherwise. For Example. Suppose the two Sums to be multiplied one by another were 259879.890625, and 1.1173698, but the Product to consist of no more than Eleven places.
Tariffa for the Mul∣tiplicand. 1 259879890625 2 519759781250 3 779639671875 4 1039519562500 5 1299399453125 6 1559279343750 7 1819159234375 8 2079039125000 9 2338919015625 Having made a Tariffa, and placed the Multiplicand and Multipli∣cator as is before directed, because in the Multiplicand there are twelve places, and eight in the Multipli∣cator, in all twenty places; and
it is desired to contract them to eleven places. First let a Line be drawn, leaving eight places to the right hand; and then let all the imaginary places underneath be supplied with Points or Cyphers, decreasing in a Triangular Figure to nothing. Then let the Multiplication be performed as follows. Let the last Figure in the Multi∣plicator be found in the Margin of the Tariffa, and the Product answering to it subscribed, only let eight places be imaginary ac∣cording to the number of Points or Cyphers, and let the remain∣ing Figures (viz. 20790) be transcribed on the other side of the Line.
Under the next Figure of the Multiplicator (9), are seven Points or Cyphers, therefore the Product answering to (9) in the Margin of the Tariffa being found, viz. 233891/9015625, let the first seven Figures to the right hand be left, and the other six in∣scribed, as in the Example is better seen. And thus must the Operation be performed, 'till all be finished; and considering that there are eight several Products, it may be well imagined, that at least (2) must be carried from the last place; and therefore (2) being added to (27) there must be set down (9), and (2) carried to the next place; and thus must be wrought the whole Multiplication,
and at last it gives the Product, as is here-under exprest, viz. And after this manner may any Multiplication be contracted to any number of places, more or less.
Division of Decimals. IN Division of Decimals, the greatest difficulty is to know of what nature the first Figure or Cypher in the Quotient ought to be, for that being once known, all other things are the very same as in the ordinary Operation of Di∣vision. And therefore I shall give this General Rule, for the finding of what nature or quality the first Figure or Cypher of any Quoti∣ent in a Decimal Operation ought to be.
General Rule. The first Figure in the Quo∣tient must and will always be of the same nature and qua∣lity with that Figure or Cy∣pher in the Dividend, which at the first Question stands over the place of Vnites in the Divisor. Example 1. Let 7.4944 be given to be di∣vided by 32. By the foregoing Rule, because the Figure (4) of the Dividend stands over the Unite (2) of the Divisor, and the Figure (4) is
a Fraction; therefore the first Fi∣gure of the Quotient (viz. 2) must be a Fraction, and have a Point prefixed. And then all the other Figures of the Quotient follow in course, as in the ordinary Method of Di∣vision. Tariffa. 1 32 2 64 3 96 4 128 5 160 6 192 7 224 8 256 9 288
Example 2. Direction In this last Example, because the Divisor may not be placed un∣der the first Figure of the Dividend, nor indeed under the second, therefore are two Cyphers put first in the Quotient, but under the third Figure it may be set, and then .0204 is found three times in 0652,
and 40 over; then bringing down (8), and adding it to 40, makes the Product (408), which is just the double of (204) which gives (2) for the last Figure of the Quotient. And after this manner may any Division be wrought, without the least difficulty or uncertainty. Example 3. Let.0006258 be the Dividend, and.0032 the Divisor. Here must be a remove before the Divisor will come under the the Dividend, which is the occa∣sion of putting one Cypher in the Quotient, before the Figure (2).
Tariffa. 1 0032 2 0064 3 0096 4 0128 5 0160 6 0192 7 0224 8 0256 9 0288
Again, Let the Numbers in the first Example be given thus: Tariffa. 1 74944 2 149888 3 224832 4 299776 5 374720 6 449664 7 524608 8 599552 9 674496
Explanation of the fore∣going Examples. Explanation of the first Example. IN the first Example a less Number 7.4944 is divided by a greater, viz. 32. The young Practitioner will presently object, and demand how this can be, for to divide one Number by another, is to demand how many times that other Num∣ber is found in the first; that is, in this case, how many times 32 is found in 7 Integers, and a Fraction of .4944.
Explanation. The Answer in plain English is this: First, 32 is not found so much as once in 7, and that is the reason of the Full-point (.) in the Quo∣tient, before the Figures of the Fraction, to signifie, that the whole Quotient consists of Deci∣mal Parts. Secondly, the first Figure of the Fraction being (2) denotes this, namely that 32 comes no nearer, being found in 7.49, &c. than 2/10, or two Tenths of once, or one time; that is to say, it comes no nearer than 2 is to 10. And the second Figure of the Quotient (3) gives to under∣stand,
that 32 comes no nearer, being found in 7.49, &c. so much as once, or one time, than 23/100, or Twenty three Hundred parts; that is to say, no nearer than 23 is to 100. And (4) the third Figure goes farther, and says, that 32 comes no nearer, being found once, or one time, in 7.49, &c. than 234/1000, or Two Hundred thirty four Thousand parts; that is to say, no nearer than 234 is to 1000. And the last Figure determining the Question, yet somewhat more exactly; that is to say, denotes that 32 comes no nearer, being found so much as once in 7.4944, than 2342/10000; that is, no nearer than 2342 is to 10000.
Explanation of the second Example. IN the second Example likewise a less Number seems to be divi∣ded by a greater, viz. .0006528 by .0204, and also (in the third Example) by .0032; and an Explanation of one of these may serve for both. And the true meaning is, 1. First .0032 cannot be found once in .0006528, therefore is a Point prefixed before the Quotient. 2. The first Cypher denotes that .0032 comes not so near, being found once in .0006528, as 1/10, or one Tenth; that is, not so near as 1 to 10.
3. The second Cypher tells the Practitioner that it comes not so near as 1/100, or as 1 to 100. 4. The Figure (3) in the third place, acquaints him, that 32 is no nearer, being found once in .0006528, than 1/1000, that is, Three parts of a Thousand, or no nearer than 3 is to 1000. And the last Figure in the Quo∣tient, (viz. 2) signifies that 32 is no nearer, being found once in . 0006528, than 32/10000; that is to say, no nearer than 32 is to 10000. And this Mystery being once throughly comprehended, and digested by the young Practitioner, there can be no farther difficulty, about a less Number being divided by a greater.
5. In the fifth and last place, by this little Book may be com∣pared together the Operations of Simple and Compound Interest, and so may be discovered how errone∣ous and extravagant the one is, and how true and rational the other, and only fit to be made use of by all those who deal in matters of Money, or Purchases, which that the Reader may better comprehend, let him consider well the following Animadversions, or Reflections.
Reflections upon Simple and Compound Interest. Reflection I. LEt there be proposed an An∣nuity of 100 l. to be conti∣nued 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 Years, and let it be demanded, what the Present Worth of such an Annuity is for any of the following Terms, at the Rate of 6 per Cent. and that as well according to Simple as Com∣pound Interest?
Answer. An Annuity of 100l. to conti∣nue for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 Years, is worth in present Money so many Years Purchase as is hereafter exprest, viz. Number of Years to be conti∣nued. Years Purchase, at Simple Inte∣rest. Years Purchase at Compound In∣terest. 10 7.93 7.35 20 14.27 11.46 30 20.03 13.76 40 25.52 15.01 50 30.87 15.72 60 36.13 16.16 70 41.32 16.38 80 46.48 16.50 90 51.60 16.57 100 56.71 16.61
By which Table it is very ob∣servable, what a small difference there is at Compound Interest, be∣tween the Present Worth of 50 Years, and the Present Worth of 100 Years, (viz. 00. 89/100) in com∣parison with the difference be∣tween 50 and 100 Years, at Simple Interest, (viz. 25 Years Purchase, more by 84/100) the one not ex∣ceeding 16 Years Purchase, more by 61/100; and the other still in∣creasing as far as almost 57 Years Purchase; and if continued to a greater Number of Years, would still swell into an extravagant Sum, for the Purchase, Treble, or Qua∣druple, to the usual Rate of Pur∣chases in the Kingdom where wo live.
Reflection II. FOr as much as it is a truth re∣ceived by all, That the Pur∣chase of an Estate or Revenue for ever, in most places of England, is not worth above 20 Years Pur∣chase, and that to be computed according to Compound Interest, which is made up of so many Geometrical Proportional Numbers: What reason can there be given, why the Present Worth of any Payment, due at any time hereafter, should not be com∣puted by the same proportion, although the Payment be but for a Year, nay, for a Day, or Hour, or Minute to come?
Thus, according to the Rate of Compound Interest, the Purchase of an Estate for 30 years to come, at 4 per Cent. is worth 17 years Purchase, and somewhat more; at 5 per Cent. is worth 15 years Purchase, more by 9/100; at 6 per Cent. is worth 13 years Purchase, more by 76/100. The same Estate for 20 years to come, at 4 per Cent. is worth 13 years and a half Pur∣chase, and somewhat more; and for 10 years to come, is worth above 8 years Purchase; and for two years to come, is worth one years Purchase, more by 88/100; and all these Numbers are Calcu∣lated as Geometrical Proportionals: Why then should the same Estate, for a Year, or 6 Months to come, be Calculated by any other Pro∣portion?
Or indeed, how can it be rightly Calculated by any other Proportion, without doing wrong to either Buyer or Seller? Reflection III. COmpound Interest being made up of Geometrical Proportio∣nals, the Debtor ought not really to pay after the Rate of 30s. a Quarter for 100l. let out to him at 6 per Cent. because, if 100l. be put out to Interest, and the Interest come to 1l. 10s. the first Quar∣ter, that 101l. 10s. by the end of the next Quarter (keeping to Geometrical Proportion) will become 103l. 5d. 1q. more by 6/100 of a Farthing; that is to say, 100l.
after this manner, would amount in a years time to 106l. 2s. 8d. 2q. more by Ninety Hundred parts of a Farthing, as may be seen by the following Calculation. Which in a great Sum is more considerable. For suppose the Crown to be indebted 1 Million, or (1000000l.) and it were agreed to pay at the Rate of 30s. for each 100l. the first Quarter, and it were not paid 'till the Twelve Months end; the Amount would be as follows.
Which at the years end amounts to 60000l. (which ought to be the Total Sum of the Interest for 12 Months, at 6 per Cent.) and over and above the said 60000l. there is 1363l. 11s. which 1 Million according to such an Accompt, if put out for a year, would amount to: So that in effect this is not 6 per Cent. but 6l. 2s. 8d. 2q. Ninety Hundred parts of a Farthing per Cent. For he who lends Money, if so soon as the first Quarters Inte∣rest grows due, and the Creditor pay it not at the just time, (if he so please) obliges the Creditor to
acknowledge so much Principal, and then it increases as aforesaid. Divers other Reflections of this kind might be made, and applied to the manifold abuses that may be committed, by Selling according to one Rate of Interest, and Buying by another, and so confounding together Simple and Compound Inte∣rest, as it makes most for the ad∣vantage of the Money Merchant, there being very few so well versed in Numbers as to contradict them. The truth is, it is as great pity that there should be two so different Calculations of Interest, as that there should be so many different Weights and Measures, and those divided and subdivided into so many Heterogeneous Fractions, which must of necessity create to
all Dealers innumerable difficul∣ties; whereas if Coyns, Weights, and Measures, were divided and subdivided by Decimals, all Cal∣culations would be performed with ease and pleasure. For Instance, If a Pound were divided into 10 Shillings, a Shilling into 10 Pence, and a Peny into 10 Farthings, and only a Point to distinguish Inte∣gers from Fractions; then the fol∣lowing Sum would easily be added together, viz. l. s. d. q. 15 9 6 1 39 8 3 0 48 7 2 1
For they might be set down thus: That is to say, the Sum would be 104 Pound, 5 Shillings, 1 Peny, and 2 Farthings. Or if these were Weights, they might be, 104 Pound-weight, 5 Ounces, 1 Dram, 2 Scruples. And after this manner might all Calculations be abbreviated,
and made much more practicable than now they are, especially the Operations of Multiplication and Division. For to multiply 48 l. 7 s. 2 d. 2 q. as they are now divided, by 124, is very troublesom, and re∣quires many Operations, both of Multiplication and Division; but in a Decimal way, it would be plain and easie by one single Multipli∣cation, viz.
That is to say, 6041 Pound, 5 Shillings, 2 Pence, and 8 Far∣things. The convenience and expedi∣tion would yet be greater in Long and Square Measures; and all for∣mer Accompts by unequal Divi∣sions, might for the present be re∣conciled and reduced to Decimals, and in a few years utterly for∣gotten, and become altogether useless. But for as much as a private Person can only give hints of what he conceives to be of publick use and benefit, and that it is a thing wholly in the Power of those who are Law-makers, to inspect and rectifie
what they in their great Wisdom shall judge amiss; the AUTHOR does in all Humility lay by his Pen, and puts a period to his Discourse upon this Subject.

THE DOCTRINE OF SIMPLE INTEREST EXPLAINED By a New and Exact Method, And the Errors of the Ordinary Rules and Tables of Rebate discovered and rectified. CHAP. I. INterest is either Simple, or Com∣pound. 1. Simple Interest, is the Increase which arises from the Principal only, at 4, 5, 6, 7, &c. per Cent. 2. Compound Interest, is the Increase which arises from the Principal, and also from the Interest thereof.
Thus, if 100 l. be lent at Simple Interest for Two Years, at 6 per Cent. the In∣crease thereof is 12 l. But if at Compound Interest, it gives 6 l. for the first Year, and 6 l. for the second Year, toge∣ther with the Interest of the first 6 l. for the second Year. That is to say: To which adding the Principal (viz. 100 l.) the Amount of both Principal and Compound Interest, for Two years, is 112.36 l. which by the Table of Reduction in the following Page is 112 l. 7 s. 2 d. 1 q. more by .000626 parts of a Pound. The Doctrine of Simple Interest is plainly and clearly set forth in the fol∣lowing Propositions. But that the Practitioner may meet with no difficulty in the respective Ope∣rations, he will here find made ready to his hand Seven short (but very significant) Tables.

The Use of the foregoing TABLES. BEcause the usual Rate of Interest is 6 per Cent. there are Tables calcu∣lated for the more ready dispatch of Questions relating either to the Amount, or Present Worth of any Sum; but for any other Rate from (1) to (12) the method will be very plain and practica∣ble. I shall begin with some Examples at 6 per Cent. Example 1. What is the Amount of 540 l. in seven Years, at 6 per Cent. Simple Interest? Rule. See for 7 years in the Margin of Table IX. and against it you find 1.42, the Amount of 1 l. in 7 years; multiply
540 by 1.42, and the Product is the Answer. Example 2. What is the Amount of 540 l. in fifteen Months, at 6 per Cent. Simple Interest? Rule. Find 15 Months in the Margin of Table X. and against it is 1.075; by that multiply 540, and the Product is the Answer.
Example 3. What is the Amount of 540 l. in 279 Days, at 6 per Cent. Simple Interest? Rule. Find 279 Days in the Margin of Table XI. and against it is 1.0458, (you may take more or less of the Fraction, according as you desire to be more or less exact;) then multiply 1.0458 by 540, and the Product is the Answer.
Example 4. What is the Present Worth of 766.8 l. at the end of 7 Years, at 6 për Cent. Simple Interest? Rule. Find 7 Years in Table XII. and against it is .704225; then multiply that by the given Number 766.8, and the Product is the Answer.
Which is within 26 Hundred Parts of a Farthing of the truth, and is a suffi∣cient Proof of the first Example. Example 5. What is the present Worth of 580.5 l. due after 15 Months, at 6 per Cent. Simple Interest?
Rule. Find 15 Months in Table XIII. and against it is .93023, &c. this being multiplied by 580.5, is an Answer. Which is within one Farthing of the truth, and may be made within one Hundredth part of a Farthing of the truth, and is a clear Proof of the second Example.
And after this manner may any Question of this kind be easily and ex∣actly resolved, and where the Sums are very great, the Operation will not be so tedious as that of working by Mr. Cla∣vel's Tables. For a Proof of which, I shall here insert two Examples, one of the Amount, and the other of the pre∣sent Worth of a considerable Sum. Example 6. Suppose the King borrows of some Bankers 259879 l. 17s. 9d. 3q. for a year and 349 Days; what will be the Amount of Principal and Interest at the expiration of a Year and 349 Days, allowing them 6 per Cent? The Operation by Mr. Clavel's Tables. In Mr. Clavel's Tables I can find no more of this Sum at one time than 10000 l. therefore I seek the Interest of that, and find the Interest of 10000 l.
The odd Money I reduce into Deci∣mal Parts of a Pound, by the Decimal Table in Mr. Russel's Appendix to Mr.Cla∣vel, thus, Then because 200000 is twenty times 10000, I must multiply this Fraction and whole Number by 20, to find the Interest of 200000 l. for a Year, and 349 Days: and also multiply the said whole Number and Fraction by 5, for the In∣terest of 50000, (there being five times 10000 contained in it) for the like time.
Example. The Interest of the remaining part of the aforesaid Sum, viz. 9879 l. 17 s. (omitting the 9 d. 3 q.) is to be found in this manner:
Reduce the Decimal Fractions of the Interest of 200000, and 50000, into Shillings and Pence, and then is the
The Answer (without considering the Interest of 9 d. 3 q. which is not to be found by Mr. Clavel's Tables) is 290381 l. 19 s. 2 d. 3 q. very near. The Operation according to the Rules of this little Book is performed by Sim∣ple Addition, thus; The given Sum redu∣ced by Table I. is 259879.890625 The Amount of 1. l. for 365 and 349 Days, viz. 714 Days, is 1.1173698

This Product, viz. 290381 l. 18 s. 9 d. 3 q. more by 86/100 of a Farthing, is the Answer. Example 7. Suppose there will be due after 349 Days, upon the several Branches of the King's Revenue, the Sum of 290381.94139 l. (or 18 s. 9 d. 3 q. more by 36/100 of a Farthing;) and His Majesty have occasion to convert this into ready Money, allow∣ing the Advancers 6 per Cent. what is the present Worth of that Sum? or what must those persons advance in ready Money for the Premises? Though it be the truest, and most exact way of all other, to Calculate either the Amount or present Worth of Money by Days, yet there is no help at all by Mr. Clavel's Tables to answer this Question.
But by this little Book, The Rule is, l. Multiply the given sum 290381.94139 by the Present Worth of 1 l. due at the end of 349 Days (which you will find in Table XIV.) .94574, and the Product is an Answer to the Question.

The Multiplication contracted, as in the Introduction is directed. After the same manner are resolved any Questions, concerning either the Amount, or present Worth of any Sum, either for Years, Months, or Days. The next thing I shall Treat of is Annuities at Simple Interest, which shall be the Sub∣ject of the following Chapter.
CHAP. II. Of Annuities at Simple Interest. THe increase of Annuities is by Mul∣tiplication of the respective Rates of Interest, according to a Trigonal Progression, which may be better seen by comparing the Golden Table of Trigonal Progression in Chap. 1. with the following Table of Trigonal Increase, or Addition of (6) the Rate of Interest per Cent. and after it short Rules, which will hold for finding the Amount, or Present Worth of any Annuity, for any number of years, at any Rate of Simple Interest whatsoever.

PROP. I. To find the Amount of any Annuity, for any given time, and at any Rate of Simple Interest. General Rule. TO the Sum of the Annual, half-yearly, Quarterly, or Monthly Payments, add the Product of the Annual, Half-Yearly, Quarterly, of Monthly Rate, multiplied by the Num∣ber in the foregoing Table, answering to the Number of Years, Half-Years, Quarters, or Months, in the Margin, that the Annuity is to continue; and the Total Sum is the true Amount of that Annuity. Example 1. What is the true Amount of an Annuity of 100 l. in five Years?
The Number in the foregoing Table answering to 5 in the Margin, is— 10 That multiplied by 6 (the Annual Interest of 100 l.) makes— 60 To which add the five Annual Pay∣ments, viz.— 500 The whole Amount is— 560 Example 2. What is the Amount of an Annuity of 62 l. in four Years? The Number in the foregoing Table answering to 4 in the Margin, is— 6 That multiplied by 3.72 (the Annual Interest of 62l. makes 22.32 To which adding the 4 Annual Payments, viz. 4 times 62 l.— 248.00 The whole Amount is— 270.32
PROP. II. To know the Present Worth of any Annuity for any given Time, at any Rate, accompting Simple Interest. FOr as much as the Present Worth of an Annuity is in effect, and must be imagined, a Principal, and the whole Amount of the Annuity as the Amount of the said Principal or Present Worth, in so long a time as the Annuity is continued, The Proportion is, As the Amount of 1 l. for any time, Is to 1 l. So is the Amount of an Annuity, To the Present Worth. Therefore the Rule is, Divide the Amount of the Annuity by the Amount of 1 l. in the given Time, and the Quotient is an Answer.
Example 1. What is the Present Worth of an Annuity of 62 l. for four Years? The Amount of 62 l. per Annum for four years by the foregoing Rules is found to be 270.32, and the Amount of 1 l. forborn four years, by Table IX. is found to be 1.24; wherefore I divide 270.32 by 1.24, thus: The Quotient 218 l. is the Answer. Example 2. What is the Present Worth of an Annuity of 100 l. to continue 100 Years?
The Amount of 100 l. Annuity for 100 years is 39700 l. the Amount of 1 l. put out to Interest for 100 years is 7 l. wherefore divide 39700 by 7, and the Quotient is the Answer. For Proof of this, let 5671.4 be put out to Interest for 100 years, at 6 per Cent.
Wherefore the Operation is exact and just, though at the same time it is a cer∣tain Argument, that the said Annuity to continue 100 years at Simple Interest, would be valued at above 56 years Pur∣chase; for dividing 5671 by 100 (that is to say, cutting off the two last Figures) the remaining Figures shew it to be 56 years Purchase, over and above the Fraction of .71. After the same Method, The Amount of 100l. Annuity in 50 years is 12350l. the Amount of 1 l. put out to Interest at 6 per Cent. for 50 years is 4 l. wherefore dividing the said Amount by (4), 4) 12350 (3087.5
The Quotient, or Present Worth is 3087.5, which is above 30 years Pur∣chase. From whence it is clear and manifest, that all Calculations of Annui∣ties at Simple Interest are absolutely useless and ridiculous: For the truth is, all Pre∣sent Worths or Purchases, either of Annui∣ties, or Principal Sums, due at any time hereafter, ought to be considered in a Geometrical Proportion, from a Purchase for ever, (or to the end of the World) ac∣cording to the several and respective Rates of Compound Interest. And if this be a truth as to Present Worths, it will be also a truth as to the Amounts, (as has been sufficiently explained in the Introduction to this Book.) And consequently, all Calculations, accor∣ding to Simple Interest, ought wholly to be laid aside as erroneous and use∣less.
CHAP. III. The ERRORS of the ordinary Rules and Tables of Rebate, relating to Annuities, according to the Rate of Simple Interest, discovered and rectified. ALthough all Tables of Rebate for Annuities at Simple Interest, ought to be wholly rejected as most ridiculous and useless, for the Reasons laid down in the foregoing Chapter, yet I do think it here seasonable, and indeed necessary▪ to animadvert upon the ordinary Rules relating to the present worth of such Annuities, which have been Composed by the respective Authors upon great mistakes, and for want of due reflection upon Arithmetical and Geometrical Pro∣gressions. I shall mention only two Examples. The first is a Rule laid down by Mr. John Kersey, in his Appendix, bound
up with Mr. Wingate's Arithmetick, Chap. 5. Pag. 378. Printed 1678. which is the very same with that made use of by Dr. Newton, in his Scale of Interest, pag. 20. When it is required to find the present worth of an Annuity, by Rebating or Discompting at a given Rate of Simple Interest, the Operation will be as in the following Example, viz. How much present Money is equivalent to an Annuity of 100 l. per Annum, to continue 5 Years, Rebate being made at the rate of 6 per Cent? Answer 425 l. 18s. 9d. 2q. very near: Thus,
For, saith he, it is manifest that there must be computed the present worth of 100 l. due at the first Years end. Also the present worth of 100 l. due at the second Years end, and in like manner for the third, fourth, and fifth Years. All which present Worths being added together, the Aggregate or Sum will be the total present worth of the Annuity, that is, 425 l. 18s. 9d. 2q. very near. I must confess I cannot but wonder how such gross mistakes should pass through the hands of so many Learned and Ingenious Artists. For this very Example I find Published by the same Mr. Kersey, in the year 1650. and since that time, owned and made use of by several others. But for the right understanding of the truth of this, and all other Questions of this kind. It is necessary to request the Reader to contemplate with me a few things.
1. What is due of an Annuity that is not paid, at the end of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years, at Sim∣ple Interest. 1. At the first years end.   l. At the first years end there is due the just sum of 100 II. At the second years end. At the second years end, there is due,   l. 1. For the first year 100 2. For the second year 100 Sum 200 And besides this, For the Interest of the 100 l. due at the first years end, and detained during the whole second year— 6 l.
III. At the third years end. At the third years end, there is due,   l. 1. For the first year 100 2. For the second year 100 3. For the third year 100 Sum 300 Besides this, there is due,   l. 1. For the Interest of the first 100 l. for the second year 6 2. For the Interest of the first 100 l. for the third year 6 3. For the Interest of the second 100 l. for the third year 6 Sum 18
IV. At the fourth years end.   l. 1. For the first year 100 2. For the second year 100 3. For the third year 100 4. For the fourth year 100 Sum 400 Besides this,   l. 1. For the Interest of the first 100l. for the second year 6 2. The Interest of the first 100l. for the third year 6 3. The Interest of the first 100l. for the fourth year 6 4. The Interest of the second 100l. for the third year 6 5. The Interest of the second 100l. for the fourth year 6 6. The Interest of the third 100l. for the fourth year 6 Sum 36
V. At the fifth years end.   l. 1. For the first year 100 2. For the second year 100 3. For the third year 100 4. For the fourth year 100 5. For the fifth year 100 Sum 500 Besides this,   l. 1. For the Interest of the first 100l. for the second year 6 2. For the Interest of the first 100l. for the third year 6 3. For the Interest of the first 100l. for the fourth year 6 4. For the Interest of the first 100l. for the fifth year 6   24
5. For the Interest of the second 100l. for the third year 6 6. For the Interest of the second 100l. for the fourth year 6 7. For the Interest of the second 100l. for the fifth year 6 8. For the Interest of the third 100l. for the fourth year 6 9. For the Interest of the third 100l. for the fifth year 6 10. For the Interest of the fourth 100l. for the fifth year 6   36   24 Sum Total of the Interest for the five years 60 To which adding the five Annual payments, viz. 500 The whole Amount of the Annuity of 100l. forborn five years, is 560 In the next place, I desire the Ingeni∣ous Reader to consider well the third Prop. of Diophantus Alexandrinus, con∣cerning Peligonal Numbers.
ΔΙΟΦΑΝΤΟΥ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΩΣ ΠΕΡΙ ΠΟΛΙΤΟΝΩΝ ΑΡΙΘΜΩΝ. PROP. III. &c. It Numbers (how many soever they be) exceed one another by an equal Internal, then the Internal between the greatest and the least, is Multipler of that equal Internal, according to the multitude of Numbers propounded, less by one. For Example. Let there be five given Terms, A, B, C, D, E, and let G be the common Interval or Difference.
To apply which, let A=100 G=6 Number of Terms. Then is,     1 A=A 1 A=100 2 B=A+G 2 B=100+6 3 C=A+G+G 3 100+6+6 4 D=A+G+G+G 4 D=100+6+6+6 5 E=A+G+G+G+G 5 E=100+6+6+6+6 That is to say, the greatest Term is equal to the least, and as many Differences as there are more Terms besides the least. So here E is equal to 100, and 4 Differences, or 4 times 6. And the Sums of those Numbers are the true Amount of an Annuity at Simple Interest; thus,
The Annual Rents, toge∣ther with the Annual Inte∣rests The Sums of Annual Rents, & Annual Inte∣rests, for there∣spective Years. The Number of An∣nual Interests, or Differences, that are contained in every re∣spective Sum, besides the Annual Rents. 1 100 1 100   2 100+6 2 206= 1 3 100+6+6 3 318= 3 4 100+6+6+6 4 436= 6 5 100+6+6+6+6 5 560= 10 Therefore the true Amount of an Annuity of 100l. is as follows. Year.   Amounts 1 100 100 2 100+100+6 206 3 100+100+100+6+6+6 318 4 100+100+100+100+6+6+6+6+6+6 436 5 100+100+100+100+100+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6 560
Consequently the Proportion is not as Mr. Kersey makes it, save only for the first year. But the true proportion holds thus, viz.       Amounts. Present worths. At the 1 years end As 106 to 100∷ So 100 to 94.33962 2 As 112 to 100∷ So 206 to 183.92856 3 As 118 to 100∷ So 318 to 269.49152 4 As 124 to 100∷ So 436 to 351.61290 5 As 130 to 100∷ So 560 to 430.76923 Now therefore to perfect the Demonstration, 1. The present worth of the first year is 94.33962
2. Because 183.92856 is the present worth of the two first years, therefore if the present worth of the first year (Viz. 94.33962) be deducted out of it, it must needs leave the present worth of the second year, viz. 89.58894 3. Because 269.49152 is the present worth of the three first years, therefore deducting out of it 183.92856, (viz. the present worth of the two first years) it leaves the present worth of the third year, viz. 85.56296 4. So deducting 269.49152 out of 351.61290, there remains the present worth of the fourth year 82.12138 5. And 430.76923 less by 351.61290, is the present worth of the last year, viz. 79.15633 Total Sum of all the present worths 430.76923
To conclude, it is evident from the two last Calculations, and that by clear Demonstration, That,   l. 1. The Amount of the first year is 100 2. The Amount of the two first years is 206 3. The Amount of the three first years is 318 4. The Amount of the four first years is 436 5. The Amount of all five years is 560 As likewise, That the present Worth, 1. Of the first year is 94.33962 2. Of the two first years is 183.92856 3. Of the three first years is 269.49152 4. Of the four first years is 351.61290 5. Of all five years is 430.76923
And lastly, it is evident and plain, That the present Worth, 1. Of the first year is 94.33962 2. Of the second year is 89.58894 3. Of the third year is 85.56296 4. Of the fourth year is 82.12138 5. Of the fifth year is 79.15633 Total Sum of the present worths 430.76923 Whereas Mr. Kersey makes the Total of the present worths but 425.93933, which is a very great mistake; as are all his particular present worths, (the first only excepted) which he could not well Calculate amiss. Besides, if 425.93933 be put out for five years, it will amount to no more than 553.714109. Whereas 430.76923 in five years, at 6 per Cent. amounts to 560 l. which is the true Amount of 100 l. per Annum for five years, as has been sufficiently Demonstrated, and agrees
exactly with the foregoing Rule: So that Mr. Kersey in this Example falls short of the truth, as to the present worth, no less than 4.8353, that is, 4l. 16 s. 8 d. 1 q. more by 96/100 of a Farthing. Which Error, if it be so considerable in an An∣nuity of 100 l. per Annum, what would it be in an Annuity of 100000 paid per Annum? No less than 4835 l. 6 s. 2 Example. A second Example I have borrowed from Mr. Dary, who has truly detected the Error of it, although he has not sufficiently explained the Reason of the Error; and therefore the Reader will find it here more strictly examined and refuted by a plain Demonstration obvi∣ous to the meanest capacity. The Example is this: What is the present worth of an Annual Rent of 62 l. to be enjoyed four Years to come, allowing the Purchaser 6 per Cent. Simple Interest?
The usual Method, says Mr. Dary, is thus: Now let the Error of this Operation be traced from the beginning. 1. The Annual Interest of 62 l. per Annum, is 3.72; where∣fore by the foregoing Prop. of Diophantus Alexandrinus, pag. 73.
The Amount of Therefore the true Amount of an Annuity of 62 l. at each years end, is as follows. At the end of the
Wherefore the true Calculation of the present Worths is as follows, viz. At the end of the
Now therefore, 1. The present worth of the first year is— 58.490 2. The present worth of the two first years less by the present worth of the first, that is, from 114.035 deducting 58.490, the present worth of the second year is— 55.545 3. The present worth of the three first years (the present worth of the two first being deducted) that is, from 167.084 deducting 114.035, the remainder of the present worth of the third year is— 53.049 4. Deducting from 218 the present worth of all four years, 167.084 the present worth of the first three years, the remainder (viz. 50.916) is the present worth of the fourth year— 50.916
So then, The present worth, Whereas the usual way of Rebate makes it not above 216.390, which is less than the truth by 1.610, which is  l. 12 s. 2 d. 2 q. ferè.
And if 216.390 be put out at Interest at 6 per Cent. for four years, it will amount to no more than 268.3236, which is less than the true Amount of 218 l. viz. 270.32 by 1.9964, which being reduced, is 1 l. 19 s. 11 d. more by 11/100 parts of a Farthing. All which may serve as a sufficient caution against such erroneous Tables and Calculations.
A second Reflection upon that Example of Mr. John Kersey. I Must confess that the present Worth of 100 l. payable a year hence is 94.33962; and that the present worth of a single 100 l. payable two years hence, is as he has put it 89.28571; and the present worth of another bare 100 l. payable three years hence is 84.74576; and so to the end. And the Total of those present worths is as he has put it, viz.
And this is part of that very Table which I have calculated (being the twelfth Table of the first Chapter of this first Book) for The present worth of One Pound after any Number of Years under 32. But reason tells me, that in this Cal∣culation there is no consideration had of the Forbearance of Interest; for certain it is, if the first 100 l. had been paid at the first years end, it might have been put out to Interest, and at the five years end would have given an increase of four times 6 l. or 24 l. at Simple Interest; and so the second 100 l. would have in∣creased in the three last years three times 6 l. or 18l. That is to say,   l. The first 100 l. would increase in the four last years 24 The second 100 l. would increase in the three last years 18 The third 100 l. would increase in the two last years 12 The fourth 100 l. would increase in the last year 6 The whole increase 60
Therefore there would be due, if all were forborn,   l. 1. At the first years end 100 2. At the second years end 100+06 3. At the third years end 100+12 4. At the fourth years end 100+18 5. At the fifth years end 100+24   500+60 Now to Calculate the present worth of any, or all of these Sums, let it be considered by what proportion the Cal∣culation ought to be made. For Example. Suppose the Annuity to be forborn only two years, and it be required to give the present worth of the two first years. Whatsoever the Answer is, all will agree, that the Sum which is given in to be the present worth of those two years, being put out to interest, must amount to  at the end of two years.
Therefore I say, As 112 to 100∷ So 206 to 183.92856. If this be a true Answer, then that Sum, viz. 183.92856, being put out to Interest at 6 per Cent. for two years, must amount to 206. By the former Rules. Now this Total Sum wants but /100000 of 206.
For, But now take the Sum of Mr. Kersey's two years present Worths, viz. Let therefore this Sum be put out to Interest for two years. Wherefore as before,
Which is less than 206 (the true Amount of an Annuity of 100 l. for two years) by .3396304; which though it be but 6 s. 8 d. and somewhat more in two years time, yet were the Sum greater, or the time longer, it would prove a very considerable Error. Wherefore I conclude, that Mr. Kersey's Calculations are erroneous as to Annui∣ties, and mine exact: And there needs no further Illustrations or Demonstrati∣ons about it. The next thing to be Treated of in course, is touching the Equation of several Payments, and reducing them into one entire Payment at a certain time, so as there may be no loss either to Creditor or Debtor.
CHAP. IV. Equation of Payments Rectified, and made Practicable for all Merchants, and others. EQuation of Payments is by all agreed to be the reducing of seve∣ral Payments into one entire Payment, at such a time, as neither Creditor or Debtor may be a loser by it, they being both agreed, the one to pay, and the other to receive, the said entire Payment at the appointed time. Now of the Books that I have met with, and the Men I have discoursed with, about Equation of Payments at Simple Interest, some have adventured to give Rules for it, others have endeavoured to shew that such Rules are erroneous, and some of the most Learned of them have concluded the thing to be absolutely impracticable and impossible; and so
left the poor Merchants to agree as they please about it. The truth is, they have been, and are all of them, mistaken about the pre∣sent Worths of Annuities at Simple Inte∣rest, and that mistake has begot many others. The method that I shall therefore take, shall be, First, to expose to the Readers view both the true Amount and present Worth of an Annuity of 100 l. for five years, at several Rates of Interest. And from thence frame, and give a gene∣ral Rule for the reducing of several equal Payments due at equi-distant times, to one entire Payment. And after that, another Rule for reducing of unequal Payments at several times not equi∣distant, to one entire Payment at a cer∣tain time, so as neither he who pays, nor he who receives it, shall be any loser by it. The Tables of the Amounts and pre∣sent Worths of an Annuity of 100 l. for five years (at different Rates of Interest) do here follow in their order.

Observations upon the foregoing Tables. 1. IT is observable, That as the Rate of Interest increases, the present Worth decreases; that is to say, For the present Worth of an Annuity of 100 l. for five years, At 1 per Cent. is 485.71428 2 472.72727 3 460.86956 4 450.00000 5 439.99999 &c. 6 430.76923 10 399.99999 &c. 2. It is no less observable, That an Annuity of 100l. increases by a Trigo∣nal Progression of the respective Rates. But the Present Worth increases by an Unitarian Addition of the Rate to the Principal for each year respectively. And these two ways are very different the one
from the other, as may be seen by com∣paring them together, as follows in the Example of an Annunity of 100l. at 6 perCent. Simple Interest.       Amount of the Annui∣ty for each of the five years. Amount of the present Worth of the Amuity for each of the five years. At the 1 years end 100 456.61538 2 206 482.46153 3 318 508.30769 4 436 534.15384 5 560 559.99999 &c. And yet how different soever they are at their first setting out, and by the way, yet the further they go, the nearer they come together, and at last agree to an insensible difference, and such as may be diminished in insinitum, either to the Hundredth, or Theirsandth, or any less part of a Farthing whatsoever can be desired. 3. As a consequence of the foregoing Observation:
If A. be to pay B. 100l. per Annum for five years, and they agree that the 500l. shall be paid at one entire Pay∣ment, they must be sure to pitch upon such a time, as that the said 500l. being put out to Interest from that time to the end of five years, may be equal to the whole Amount of those five Annual Payments. For Example. Let the Rate of Interest be 6 per Cent. per Annum, and the Time of paying the said 500l. be at the end of three years, and so there are two years to come. If the said 500l. for two years, at 6 per Cent. will amount to 560l. (which is the whole Amount of the Annuity at the five years end) the Time is right, if not, it is a false Time. But the Annual Interest of 500l. is 30l. therefore in two years it is 60l. and that added to 500, makes 560l. And therefore it was a just time to pay the said 500l. at one entire Payment. For so B. has at the five years end, the whole
effect of his Annuity improved to the utmost, at 6 per Cent. Simple Interest. And B. having paid nothing before of the Annuity, and being obliged to pay nothing of it afterwards; but having enjoyed it for three years (which is the best part of it) already, and being to enjoy it two years more; the 500l. he now pays, is only as a Purchase of the Amount of the whole Annuity, which will be due at the five years end, viz. 560 l. and so gives the Present Worth of 560 l. from the three years end to the 5 years end; and so he pays not a Farthing more than the true worth of it. And for that true worth of it, to the end of the 5 years he has enjoyed, and must enjoy the said Annuity it self to the end of the said five years. And so neither A. nor B. have the least wrong or loss, neither the one by paying, nor the other by recei∣ving, this one entire Payment of 500 l. at the three years end; and if either or both should sell their concerns, it would be the same thing.
4. It is observable that the present Worth of the said Annuity, at any Rate of Interest, does at the three years end ex∣ceed the Aggregate of the said five Sums, (or 500 l.) For Example. The present Worth of an Annuity of 100 l. per Annum to continue five years, does at the end of three years, Amount, At 1 per Cent. to 500.28570 2 501.09089 3 502.34782 4 504.00000 5 505.99999 6 508.30769 10 520.00000 5. It being as evident from this last Observation, That the present Worth of the whole Annuity being put out to Inte∣rest for three years, will at any Rate of Interest, exceed the Aggregate of all
the five Payments, and the greater the Rate of Interest is, the greater is that Excess. For Example. At (1) per Cent. the Excess is but . 28570; at (2) per Cent. the Excess is somewhat more, viz. 1.09089; at (3) per Cent. it is 2.34782; at (10) per Cent. it is 20l. and at (15) per Cent. it would be much more. And it being likewise evident by all the foregoing Tables, whatever the Rate of Interest be, That 500l. more by the Interest of 500l. for two years, is equal to the whole Amount of the Annuity of 500l. for five years. That is to say, The Interest of 500 l. for two years, At (1) per Cent. is 10 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 510 l. At (2) per Cent. is 20 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 520 l.
At (3) per Cent. is 30 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 530 l. At (4) per Cent. is 40 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 540 l. At (5) per Cent. is 50 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 550 l. At (6) per Cent. is 60 l. which added to 500 l. makes the Amount 560 l. And lastly, it being sufficiently evi∣dent by the third Observation, That if the 500 l. be paid at one entire Payment, at the end of three years, or, which is all one, two years before the Annuity be at an end; neither Creditor nor Debtor can have the least wrong, or suffer the least loss. It may therefore be safely concluded, That it is practicable and possible to give a good and true Rule for Equation of seve∣ral Payments; and likewise, that it is no way necessary (as some very Learned
Artists would needs have perswaded me) to try that Rule by this Mark, viz. That the present Worth of the said 500 l. at the three Years end, must be the present Worth of the whole Amount of the said An∣nuity. For by what has been already proved, the present Worth of the whole Annuity at any Rate of Interest, will at the three years end exceed the said 500 l. Now therefore I shall proceed to give two General Rules. The first, for Equation of several equal Payments at equi-distant times. The second, for Equation of several unequal Payments at several times not equi-distant. 1. General Rule. For Equation of any given Number of equal Payments due at equi-distant Times. Rule. Out of the whole Amount of the An∣nuity, of Monthly Payment, deduct
the Aggregate of the several Pay∣ments, and the Remainder, if Annual, multiply by 365; if Monthly, by 30.416; then divide the Product by the Annual, or Monthly Interest of the said Aggre∣gate, and the Quotient is the number of Days, before the end or Term of the Annuity, or Monthly Payment, when the said Aggregate may be paid with∣out loss to either Creditor or Debtor. 1. Example. Let the Annuity be 100 l. The time it is to continue five years. The whole Amount of the An∣nuity 560 The Aggregate of the several Payments 500 The Annual Interest of the Ag∣gregate (viz. 500) 30 Now suppose A. be obliged to pay to B. 100 l. per Annum for five years, but they both agree that A. shall pay to B. the Aggregate 500 l. at one entire Pay∣ment.
And then the Question is, at what time the said 500 l. is to be paid? Therefore as the Rule directs, That divided by 30, gives a Quotient, which is the true number of Days before the end of the said Annuity, when the said 500 l. is to be paid, viz. 730 Those 730 Days divided by 365, gives a Quotient of two years. So then the true time of paying the said Aggregate of several payments, (viz. 500 l.) is two years before the end of five years; that is at the end of the third year.
2. Example. A. is to pay B. 62 l. per Annum for four years; but they agree that A. shall pay the Aggregate of the several Sums, (viz. 248) at one entire Payment. If the Annual Payment be 62.00 The Amount of that in four years, at 6 per Cent. will be 270.32 The Aggregate of the several Payments, or four times 62, is 248.00 The Annual Interest of the said Aggregate 14.88 Wherefore, This 22.32 is first to be multiplied by 365, which is 8146.80.
That Product 8146.80 being divided by the Annual Interest of the Aggregate 248, viz. 14.88, gives a Quotient of 547.5 Days. This Quotient 547 Days and /10, or a half, is a true Answer to the Question; that is to say, 547 Days and a half, or one Year, and 172 Days and a half, be∣fore the end of four years, is the just time to pay the said Aggregate, or 248, at one entire Payment; so as neither he who pays it, nor he who receives it, may be a loser. But that all things may be exposed clearly to the Readers view, I shall here repeat the thing, and set down the whole Operation. 1. The Annual Payment for four years is 62.00 l. 2. The whole Amount of this in four years is 270.32 l. 3. The Aggregate, or four years Payments, that is, four times 62l. is 248.00 l. 4. The Annual Interest of the said Aggregate is 14.88 l.
Now the Question is, what is the true time for paying the said Aggregate, or 248, at one entire Payment? To Answer this, I proceed according to the aforesaid Rule. 2. I multiply this Remainder by 365, thus, 3. This Product I divide by the Annual Interest of the Aggregate, viz. 14.88.

That is to say, (as before) one year, and 172 days, and a half, before the end of four years. Or, which is the same thing, two years, and 192 days and a half, after the Agreement, must the 248 l. be paid at one entire Payment; and for the Reasons aforesaid, there is no loss to either A. or B.
For Proof of this, Let 248 l. be put out to Interest at 6 per Cent. for one year, and 172 days and a half, that is, 547.5 days (which is the Quotient, or the time given from the Payment thereof to the end of the Annuity) and if it make up the whole Amount of the Annuity, viz. 270.32, the Operation is right.

For Example. Then I make the following Tariffa, and proceed to multiply the foregoing Pro∣duct by 248. Tariffa for the Multiplicand. 1 089999999100 2 179999998200 3 269999997300 4 359999996400 5 449999995500 6 539999994600 7 629999993700 8 719999992800 9 809999991900
Wanting but 1/10000 (which is not the Hundredth part of a Farthing) of the true Amount of the whole Annuity, viz. 270.32, and therefore the Opera∣tion is just. And thus may any Question of this nature be resolved, to a Day, and parts of a Day; for if both these last Questions had been made for Months, the same Rule must have been observed. For Example. If A. is to pay to B. 100 l. per Month for five Months, when may he pay the 500 l. at one entire Payment, at the Rate of 6 per Cent?
The Payments being Monthly, Therefore, In pursuance of the aforesaid General Rule.
Let therefore 5 be multiplied by 30.416, or the true number of Days that are in one equal Month. And let that (152.080) be divided by 2.500, or the Monthly Interest of 500 l. at 6 per Cent. Tariffa for the Divisor. 1 25 2 50 3 75 4 100 5 125 6 150 7 175 8 200 9 225 The Quotient (60.832) is a true Answer in Days.
That is to say, 60 Days and 832/1000 of a Day, (which makes two equal Months) before the end of five Months; or (which is all one) three Months after the agreement, or after the first day, when the said Debt was growing due, is the just time of paying the 500 l. at one entire Payment. For Proof of this. If 500 l. be put out to Interest at 6 per Cent. for two equal Months, or 60.832 Days, and does give 5 l. it makes the 500 l. become 505 l. which is the full Amount of those five Months Pay∣ments, and is a just Answer to the Que∣stion. But, And the Operation is exact.
And this I take to be sufficient for the Resolution of any Question of this nature. I shall proceed in the next place to Discourse about unequal Payments, at times not equi-distant.
A brief Discourse concerning the Equation of unequal Payments at Times not equi-distant. For Example. A Merchant owes 500 l. to be paid at three several unequal Payments, viz. at the end of four Months 300 l. at the end of six Months 100 l. and at the end of twelve Months 100 l. but the Debtor agrees with the Creditor to dis∣charge the Debt (viz. 500 l.) at one entire Payment. The Question is, at what time this 500 l. may be paid, without damage or prejudice to either Creditor or Debtor? The General Rule is this. First find the true Amount of each of the Sums, from the first day of the A∣greement, to the last day of Payment, as supposing them to be forborn to the last. Then out of that deduct the Aggregate
of the respective Payments, and multi∣ply the Remainder, if Annual, by 365; if Monthly, by 30.4166; and the Pro∣duct divide by the Annual or Monthly Interest of the said Aggregate, and the Quotient is the Number of Days from the last Day of Payment, ac∣compting backwards. The Operation is as follows. First, the length of Time from the day of the Agreement, to the last day of Payment, is just twelve Months. So then, 1. In the first place, 300 l. pay∣able after 4 Months, and be∣ing forborn to the end of 12 Months, has 8 Months Inte∣rest to accompt for, viz. 12.000 2. In the second place, 100 l. payable after 6 Months, and being forborn to the end of 12 Months, has 6 Months Interest to accompt for, viz. 3.000 3. To these Sums adding the 500.000 The whole Amount is 515.000
Then, And the Proportion is this. If 2.5 be the Interest of 500 l. for one Month, how many Months Interest will 15 make? Wherefore divide 15 by 2.5, and the Quotient is the Answer to the Question. Tariffa for the Divisor. 1 25 2 50 3 75 4 100 5 125 6 150 7 175 8 200 9 225 The Operation is this. That is to say, if the said 500 l. be paid six Months before the end of twelve Months or (which is all one) at the end of
six Months, there will be no loss or damage either to Creditor or Debtor. For Proof of this, 1. In the first place, 300l. was due at 4 Months end, and being con∣tinued 2 Months longer, the In∣terest thereof for 2 Months is 3 l. the whole Amount is 303 l. 2. In the next place, 100 l. paid at 6 Months end, is the time it was due 100 l. 3. In the last place, the other 100 l. paid 6 Months before the time, there must be an abatement made of 3 l. 97 l. Total Sum 500 l. So that in the first Sum there is an increase of 3 l. and in the last there is a decrease of 3 l. which are to be set one against the other; and the whole Amount is the Aggregate of the respe∣ctive Sums, and being paid at the end of 6 Months makes the Equation just 500 l.
After this manner may any Number of unequal Sums payable at any Number of Times not equi-distant, be Equated, and a time set for the Payment of the Aggregate; and not only so, but if the Debtor A. owe to B. 100l. per Annum, or per Month, for any Number of Years or Months, and A. and B. agreeing toge∣ther that it shall be in the power of A. to pay to B. the true value of his Preten∣sions at the end of any of the Years or Months, it is very Practicable, for the present Worth of the whole Amount at the end of any of the Years or Months resolves the doubt, and is an Answer the Question. For Example. A. owes to B. 100 l. per Annum for five years, and they agree that A. shall buy it off at the end of any of the four years, for at the end of 5 years nothing less than the whole 560 l. will pay the Dein. 1. The present worth of 560 l. (or the whole Amount) at the first years end, is 451.6129
2. The present worth of 560 l. at the second years end, is 474.5762 3. The present worth of 560 l. at the third years end, is 500, 0000 4. The present worth of 560 l. at the fourth years end, is 528.3018 5. The present worth of 560 l. at the fifth years end, is 560, 0000 Thus I have as briefly as the nature of the thing would permit, explained the Doctrine of Simple Interest, as likewise that of Annuities, and Equation of several Pay∣ments at Simple Interest, which is of ex∣cellent use for 6 12, or 18 Months, because the difference between Simple and Com∣pound Interest is not material in so short a time. But for as much as the business of An∣uities, or Purchases, for any considerable Number of years, does most properly and truly belong to the Doctrine of Com∣pound Interest, I shall make that the Sub∣ject of the following Book.
THE DOCTRINE OF COMPOUND INTEREST. LIB. II. CHAP. I. The Doctrine of Compound Interest explained. Compound Interest, or Interest upon Interest, increases not only from the Principal, but also from the Interest, in the man∣ner hereafter exprest.
That is to say, If 100l. be put out to Interest at 6 per Cent. 1. The first year there will be due 106.0000 2. The second year that (106l.) is made a Princi∣pal, and being put out for a year, becomes 112.3600 3. The third year that (112.360) is made a Prin∣cipal, and being put out to Interest, amounts to 119.1016 And so in infinitum. So that the respective Amounts for each respective year, are so many Geome∣trical Proportional Numbers. For, As 100 to 106, for the first year ∷ So 106 to 112.36, for the second year.
Again, As 106 to 112.36 ∷ So 112.36 to 119.1016, for the third year. Item, As 112.36 to 119.1016 ∷ So 119.1016 to 126.247016, for the fourth year. &c. But to the end, that the Ingenious Practitioner may have entire satisfaction in the business of Interest upon Interest, it will be necessary to make some Re∣flection upon Geometrical Proportion and Progression. Reflection upon Geometrical Progression. If Numbers (how many soever they be) contain the one the other by an equal Ratio, then the greatest of those Num∣bers is Multipler of the Powers of the Denomination of that equal Ratio mul∣tiplied by the least, according to the mul∣titude of the given Numbers less by one.
Let the given Numbers be 2, 6, 18, 54. Then by the Hypothesis, the first multiplied by (3) is equal to the second; and the second multiplied by (3) is equal to the third; and so in infinitum. That is to say, First Term 2=2 ———— 2 Second 6=2 into 3 ——— 6 Third 18=2 into 3 into 3 —— 18 Fourth 54=2 into 3 into 3 into 3 — 54 That is to say in a Symbolical way,
Let there be any Number of Proportionals, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and the Ratio R. First Term A=A Second B=A into R Third C=A into R into R Fourth D=A into R into R into R Fifth E=A into R into R into R into R Sixth F=A into R into R into R into R into R Seventh G=A into R into R into R into R into R into R
To apply this to the present purpose, let the first Geometrical Term be (1.) the Ratio (. 06)   First Power. Second Power. Third Power. Fourth Power. Fifth Power. Sixth Power.

NOw for as much as these Geometri∣cal Proportional Numbers swell into a great Number of places, and the Mul∣tiplications become tedious, it has been look'd upon as impracticable to find them out by any way, but by the help of the Logarithms. But I shall endeavour to shew a way how it may be very practi∣cable to find out any of these Numbers, for any year under 32, without much trouble or difficulty. For Example. Let it be demanded to give the Amount of I l. in eight years, at 6 per Cent. Compound Interest, not having any help of a Table. The Operation is thus. First, I Square 1.06, which is 1.1236, and the Product is the Amount in two years.
Secondly, I Square 1.1236, and that gives me the Proportional Number an∣swering to (4) in the Margin, viz. 1.26247, &c. Thirdly, I Square 1.26247, and that gives me the Proportional Number answer∣ing to (8) in the Margin, which was the thing proposed, viz. 1.59384, &c. Now if it had been demanded to find the Proportional Number answering to (16) in the Margin, it is the Square of 1.59384, &c. And the Square of 1.59384 gives the Proportional Number answering to (32) in the Margin. Thus far the Method is clear for all even Numbers; but for the odd Num∣bers, The Rule is this: Having found the Proportional Number answering to the greater half of the given Number in the Margin, Square it, and divide it by the least and
first Proportional Number, and the Quotient is the Number desired. For Example. Let it be demanded to find the Propor∣tional Number answering to (3) in the Margin, and let (1.06) be the least Pro∣portional Number. Having found 1.1236 to be the Proportional Number answering to (2) in the Margin, which (2) is the greater half of (3), I Square 1.1236, and it gives 1.26247, which I divide by 1.06, and the Quotient (1.1910, &c.) is the Proportional Number desired. Again, Let it be demanded to find the Propor∣tional Number answering to (5) in the Margin.
Having found the Proportional Number answering to (3) in the Margin, (which 3 is the greater half of 5) viz. 1.1910; the Square thereof, viz. 1.4185, being divided by 1.06, the Quotient is the Number desired, viz. 1.3382. Thus (9) is the greater half of (17), and therefore the Proportional Number answering to (9) in the Margin being Squared, and that Square divided by 1.06, gives 3.700, for the Proportional Number answering to (17) in the Mar∣gin. And so may the Proportional Num∣ber of any odd Number in the Margin be found out, without the help of Lo∣garithms. But for as much as exact Tables truly Calculated are most ready for use, I have with no small Pains and Charge (not Transcribed other Mens Tables and Errors, but) carefully and exactly Cal∣culated several Tables of my own; by the help of which, may easily and rea∣dily be found out either the Amount, or Present Worth of any Sum, at any Rate of Compound Interest, and the like for
Annuities and Purchases, after the same manner, and in the same method as I have done in the first Book of this small Treatise, for the Amount and Present Worth of either Principal Sums, or Annuities, at Simple Interest.

CHAP. II. The Use of the preceding TABLES of Compound Interest. HAving with all imaginable care framed and calculated divers Tables relating to Compound Interest, it will be needful to apply the same to Use and Practice. The Use of the first TABLE, shown in Two Examples. Example I. Suppose it be demanded to give the Amount of 136l. 15s. 6d. being for∣born 20 years, at 6 per Cent. Compound Interest.
Direction. The given Sum must first be reduced by the first Table of the first Book, and made 136.775, and then multiplied by the Number in the first Table answering to (20), in the Margin of pag. 144, viz. 3.20713. Tariffa for the Mul∣tiplicand. 1 136775 2 273550 3 410325 4 547100 5 683875 6 820650 7 957425 8 1094200 9 1230975
The Operation may be contracted, according to the Rule in the Intro∣duction. The Product 438.6552 is the true Answer, and being reduced by the fifteenth Table of the first Book, makes 438l. 13 s. 1 d. 1 q. Example 2. Suppose it be demanded to give the Amount of the aforesaid Sum in 20 Years and 3 Quarters.
Direction. Multiply the aforesaid Sum of 136.775, by the Number which answers to 20 Years and 3 Quarters, viz. 3.35040. The Operation may be contracted as before. The Product 458.2509 is the Answer to the Question, and being reduced by the fifteenth Table of the first Book, makes 458l. 5s. more by 22/100 (or Ninety Two Hundred parts) of a Farthing.
The use of the second TABLE. Suppose it be desired to know the Amount of 42 l. in 7 Months, at 6 per Cent. Compound Interest. Direction. Seek the Number in Table II. an∣swering to (7) in the Margin, viz. 1.034574, and multiply it by 42, and the Product is the Answer. Which Product being reduced is 43 l. 9 s. 2 q. more by 2/100 (or Two Hundred parts) of a Farthing.
The use of the third TABLE. Suppose it be demanded to find the Amount of 42 l. in 104 Days. Direction. Find the Number in Table III. an∣swering to (104) in the Margin, viz. 1.016741, and multiply that by 42, and the Product is the Answer.

Let it be required to find the Present Worth of an Annuity of 56 l. to continue 21 years, and payable by yearly pay∣ments, at the Rate of 6 per Cent. Com∣pound Interest. Direction. First find the Number in Table VII. answering to (21) in the Margin, which is 11.76407; then multiply it by 56, without a Tariffa, because there are but two places in the Multiplicator, and the Product is the Answer.
Which Product being reduced by the fifteenth Table of the first Book, makes 657 l. 15 s. 9 d. more by 40/100 (or Forty Hundred parts) of a Farthing, which agrees with Mr. Kersey's Exam∣ple, in his Appendix to Mr. Wingate's Arithmetick, pag. 412. only this Calcu∣lation is more exact than his, and some∣what nearer to the truth. The Use of the eighth TABLE. Let it be demanded what Annuity, to continue 14 years, and payable by yearly payments, will 320 l. buy, allowing 6 per Cent. Compound Interest.
Direction. Seek in the Margin of Table VIII. the Number (14), and the Number answering to it, under the Title of 6 per Cent. viz. .10758; which mul∣tiply by 320, and the Product is the Answer.

A farther Use of the seventh TABLE. To convert a present Sum or Fine into an Annual Rent; or on the contrary, to bring down an Annual Rent by a present Sum or Fine. Example 1. A Landlord Lets a Lease of a House and Land for 21 years, and is to have 100 l. for that Lease, and a yearly pay∣ment of 30 l. what Fine or present Money must the Tenant give, to bring down the Rent from 30 l. to 10 l. per Annum, allowing 6 per Cent. Compound Interest? Direction. First find the difference of 10 l. and 30 l. which is 20 l. then find by Table VII. pag. 176. what an Annuity of 1 l. to continue 21 years, is worth in present Money, which is 11.76407 l. then multiply 11.76407 by 20, and the
Product gives the Present Worth of 20 l. per Annum for 21 years. The Operation. Which Product 235.28140 being re∣duced, is 235 l. 5 s. 7 d. 2 q. more by 14/100 (or Fourteen Hundred parts) of a Farthing. Example 2. A Landlord demands a Fine, or pre∣sent Sum, for a Lease of 127 l. per Annum, to continue 7 years; what is the Sum, allowing 6 per Cent. Com∣pound Interest? Direction. Find by Table VII. the Present Worth of 1 l. Annuity for 7 years, at 6 per Cent. viz. 5.58238, which multiply by 127, and the Product is the Answer.
The Operation. Which Product 708.96226 being re∣duced by the fifteenth Table of the first Book, makes the just Sum of 708 l. 19 s. 2 d. 3 q. more by 77/100 (or Seventy Seven Hundred parts) of a Farthing. And here the Reader is desired to take notice of a printed Sheet sold in Westmin∣ster-Hall, Entituled, “A President for Purchasers, &c. Or Anatocisme (commonly called Compound Interest) made easie, &c. Computedly W. Leybourn. The principal Table in this Sheet is printed from a Copper Plate, but so full of gross Errors and mistakes, that it is not sit to be used: For
In this last Example, that Table makes tho Sum but 706 l. 16 s. 6 d. which the Table of this Book makes 708 l. 19 s. 2 d. 3 q. and more, (which Sum agrees with Mr. Clavel's Tables). But in very many places there is no less than 4, 5, 6, and 10 Pound mistaken, which must needs deceive all those, who do in the least rely upon, or give any cre∣dit to it. So that the AUTHOR of this little Book hopes, That the manifold Errors in the Calculations of other Writers, will occasion a more kind acceptance of his more than ordinary care and diligence in all the foregoing Tables; if not, —Redit Labor actus in Orbem. .
