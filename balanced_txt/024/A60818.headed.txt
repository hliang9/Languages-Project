RICHARD BANNER, Secretary of the said Company. At a Quarters-Court 25 Novemb. 1663. WHereas the building of Ships in the Summer-Islands, if not restrained by Law, may be of dangerous consequence to the welfare of the Company and the Plantation; as name∣ly, That the Timber of the Islands by the building of Ships will be utterly destroyed; That when the Inhabitants have Shipping of their own, occasion will be given to steal and carry away the Tobacco, and so the Company deprived of their Duties; The Magazene-Ships sent from the Company will be disappointed of their Freight; at least entertained at great uncertainties; And lastly the Members of the Company, and Owners of Land here, will lose their Rents and Debts, and in short time their whole Estate; for prevention thereof, Be it Enacted and Ordained, and this General Court do ordain and establish, That no Vessel exceeding five Tunns shall be by any person or persons upon any pretence whatsoever erected or built in the said Islands, without express Orders from the Company first had and obtained. And if any person or persons shall presume to erect any Vessel within the said Islands exceeding five Tunns or upwards, That upon discovery and legal proof of the same taken before the Go∣vernour or any of the Council there, all and every such Vessel to be forfeited and seized upon, and sold for the use of the Company; and out of the Money to be raised thereupon, one fourth part to be paid to the party that shall give the Information, and the other three parts to be paid to the Sheriff of the said Islands; to be laid out for general and publick uses. At a Quarter Court for the Summer-Islands Company, held at Armourers Hall in Coleman-street, London: Wednesday, the 10th of Febru∣ary, 1669. THE Company taking into Consideration, that the only ground of the present differences that are among them, hath been the entertaining of a Ship wherein one or more par∣ticular Members have had Interest, and that the same hath been found by daily experience to be very prejudicial to the Company; and that no Articles have of late been observed, no En∣voices given as they ought to have been; the Accounts such only as the Company could have no check upon; besides the general damage to the Plantation by Transporting of Cedar, and other∣wise, and that the entertaining of strange Ships would much conduce to the benefit of the Compa∣pany, as that the Company would then have due Account; None would be encouraged to wrong the Company and Plantation; the Members would agree to punish Offenders, and the whole would tend to Union in the Company.
Be it Enacted and Ordained, That no Ship shall be entertained by this Company as a Magazceen-Ship, in any Voyage to the Summer-Islands, for the future, wherein any Member or Members of this Company, have or shall have any particular share or Interest. THOMAS MARTIN, Secretary to the said Company. The 117th Law of the Company Printed. ALL Grants from the Company of mens private Lands in the Summer-Islands, shall pass under the Common Seal of the Company; which shall be sufficient eviidence for the said Lands, &c. At a Quarter-Court the 25 of May, 1636. WHereas it is given out, That divers of the Planters that live in the Islands, do intend, and are about to buy divers shares of Land for their own use; which in time may be of ill consequence to this State, and Company, and their Governours: for the preventing there∣of, This Court do Order and give Authority for the buying of all such Lands, and do also Con∣firm their former Order, That no one shall be admitted of the Company, by Vertue of any Land he shall buy, unless the same Land were first offered to the Company; nor any such Deed to be ratified under the Companies Seal.
