TO THE MOST NOBLE COMBINER OF LEARNING, AND HONOVR: Sr. FRANCIS BACON, Knight; Lord High Chancelor of England, &c. ANtient wisedome, being so worthi∣ly eternis'd; by the now-renew'd Instance of it in your Lordship; And this ancient Authour, one of the most Authentique, for all wise∣dome, crown'd with Iustice and Pie∣tie: To what Sea owe these poore Streames their Tribute, but to your Lordships Ocean? The rather, since others of the like Antiquity, in my Trāslation of Homer, teach These their way, and adde comfort to their Courses; by ha∣uing receiued right cheerfull countenance and approbation from your Lordships most graue and honourd predecessor. All Iudgements of this Season (sauouring any thing the truth) preferring, to the wisedome of all other Nations, these most wise, learned, and circularly-spoken Grecians. Ac∣cording to that of the Poet: Graijs Ingenium; Graijs dedit ore rotund Musa loqui.
And why may not this Romane Elogie of the Graians, ex∣tend in praisefull Intention (by waie of Prophetick Poesie) To Graies-Inne wits, and Orators? Or if the allusion (or pe∣tition of the Principle) begge with too broad a Licence in the Generall: yet serious Truth, for the Particular, may most worthily apply it to your Lop•. truely-Greek Inspirati∣on, and absolutely Attick Elocution. Whose all-acknowledg'd facultie, hath banisht Flattery therein, euen from the Court; much more from my countrie, and more-then-vpland sim∣plicitie. Nor were those Greeks so circular in their elegant vt∣terance, but their inward Iudgements and learnings, were as round and solid. Their solidity prov'd in their eternity; and their eternity propagated, by Loue of all vertue, and integri∣tie: That Loue being the onely Parent, and argument, of all Truth, in any wisedome or learning; without which, all is sophisticate, and adulterate; howsoeuer painted & splinted with Degrees and Languages. Your Lordships aduance∣ment of Learning, then, well showing your loue to it; and in it, being true, to all true Goodnes; your Learning streng∣thening that loue, must needs bee solide and eternall. This Vir verè (seu clarè) sciens: aut illustris Iu∣dex, vel pro∣cul videns Arbiter; quia eos acu∣tos visu, seu gnaros esse oporteat ri de qua agi∣tur.  therefore, exprest in this Author, is vsed here, as if prophecied by him then, now to take life in your Lop. whose life is chiefe soule, and essence, to all knowledge, and vertue: So few there are that liue now, combining Ho∣nour and Learning. This Time, resembling the terrible Time whereof this Poet prophecied; to which hee de∣sired he might not liue: since not a Grace would then smile, on any pious, or worthie; All Greatnesse, much more gra∣cing Impostors, then Men truely desertfull; The worse de∣prauing the better; and that so frontlesly, that Shame and Iu∣stice, should flie the earth for them. To shame wch ignorant Barbarisme now emboldned; Let your Lordships learned hu∣manitie, proue nothing the lesse gracious to Vertue, for the cōmunity of Vices graces; but shine much the more cleere on
her, for those clouds that eclipse her; no Lustre being so Sun like, as that which passeth aboue al clouds vnseen, ouer Fields, Turrets, & Temples; and breaks out, in free beams, on some humblest Cotage. In whose like, Ioue him selfe hath been fea∣sted; And wherein your Lordship may finde more honour, than in the fretted Roofes of the Mighty. To which honor, oftentimes, nothing more conduceth, then Noble accep∣tance of most humble Presentments. On this Noblitie in your Lordshippe, my prostrate humility relying; I rest euer submitted in all simple and hearty vowes, Your Honours most truly, and freely deuoted, GEORGE CHAPMAN.
Of Hesiodus. Hesiodus, surnam'd Ascraeus, was one, as of the most anti∣ent Greeke Poets; so one of the purest and pressest writers. He liu'd in the later time of Homer; & was sur∣named Ascraeus; of Ascra, a Towne in Helicon; in which was built a tēple sacred to the Muses; whose Priest, Hesiodus was consecrate: whom Virg. among so many writers of Georgicks, only imitated; professing it in this; Ascraeum{que} cano Romana per oppida carmen, . Nor is there any doubt, (saith Mel:) quin idē Virg: initio Georgicorū, hanc inscriptionem expresserit hoc versu: Quid faciat laetas segetes; quo sidere terram &c. His autoritie was such amongst the Antients; that his verses were commonly learned, as Axioms or Oracles; All tea∣ching good life, and humanitie: which though neuer so profita∣ble for mens now readings; yet had they rather (saith Isocrates) consume their times still in their owne follies, than bee any time conuersant in these precepts of wisedome; Of which (with Ho∣mer) he was first Father, whose Interpreters were al the succeeding Philosophers; Not Aristotle himselfe excepted: who before Thales, Solon, Pittacus, Socrates, Plato, &c. writ of Life, of Manners, of God, of Nature, of the Starres, and generall state of the vniuerse. Not are his writings the lesse worthy; that Poesie informde them, but of so much the more Dignitie, and Eternitie: Not Thales, nor Anaxa∣goras, (as Aristotle ingenuously confesseth) hauing profited the world so much with all their writings; as Homers one Vlisses, or Nestor. And sooner shall all the Atomes of Epicurus sustaine diuisi∣on; the fire of Heraclitus be vtterly quencht; the water that Thales extolls so much, bee exhausted; the spirit of Anaxamines vanish; the discord of Empedocles be reconciled; & all dissolu'd to nothing; before by their most celebrated faculties, they doe the world so∣much profit for all humane instruction, as this one Work of Hesi∣odus: Here beeing no dwelling on any one subiect; but of all hu∣mane affaires instructiuely concluded.
To my worthy friend Mr. George Chapman, and his translated Hesiod. CHapman; We finde by thy past-prized fraught, What wealth thou dost vpon this Land conferre; Th'olde Graecian Prophets hither that hast brought, Of their full words the true Interpreter: And by thy trauell, strongly hast exprest The large dimensions of the English tongue; Deliuering them so well, the first and best, That to the world in Numbers euer sung. Thou hast vnlock'd the treasury, wherein All Art; and knowledge haue so long been hidden: Which, till the gracefull Muses did begin Here to inhabite, was to vs forbidden. In blest Elizium, (in a place most fit) Vnder that tree due to the Delphian God, Musaeus, and that Iliad Singer sit, And neare to them that noble Hesiod, Smoothing their rugged foreheads; and do smile, After so many hundred yeares to see Their Poems read in this farre westerne Ile, Translated from their ancient Greeke, by thee; Each his good Genius whispering in his eare, That with so lucky, and aspicious fate Did still attend them, whilst they liuing were, And gaue their Verses such a lasting date. Where slightly passing by the Thespian spring, Many long after did but onely sup; Nature, then fruitfull, forth these men did bring, To fetch deepe Rowses from Ioues plentious cup. In thy free labours (friend) then rest content.
Feare not Detraction, neither fawne on Praise: When idle Censure all her force hath spent, Knowledge can crowne her self with her owne Baies. Their Lines, that haue so many liues outworne, Cleerely expounded, shall base Enuy scorne. Michael Drayton. To my worthy and honour'd Friend, Mr George Chapman, on his Tran∣slation of Hesiods Works, & Dayes. WHose worke could this be▪ Chapman, to refine Olde Hesiods Ore, and giue it vs; but thine, Who hadst before wrought in rich Homers Mine? What treasure hast thou brought vs! and what store Still, still, dost thou arriue with, at our shore, To make thy honour, and our wealth the more! If all the vulgar Tongues, that speake this day, Were askt of thy Discoueries; They must say, To the Greeke coast thine onely knew the way. Such Passage hast thou found such Returnes made, As, now of all men, it is call'd thy Trade: And who make thither else, rob, or inuade. Ben: Ionson.

With what Earth beares; And Ceres doth bestowe; With which, when thou art satiate; Nor dost know, What to do with it: Then, to those wars go, For others Goods: But see no more spent so Of thine hereafter. Let our selues decide, With Doomes direct; All diff'rences implide, In our Affaires; And what is ratifide, By Ioues will, to be ours; Account our owne; For that thriues euer best.

But God hath hid from Men the healthfull Meane; For otherwise, A Man might heap (and play) Enough to serue the whole yeare, in a Day; And strait, his Draught-Tree hang vp in the smoke, Nor more, his labouring Mules, nor Oxen yoke. But Ioue; Mans knowledge of his Best, bereau'd; Conceiuing Anger, since he was deceau'd, By that same , he calles Prome∣theus; i. qui obliqua agitat consilia; who wrests that wisdome which God hath giuen him to vse to his glorie; To his owne ends: which is cause to all the miseries Men suffer, and of all their im∣pious actions that deserue them.

His sentence & inuention; made so com∣mon; that their Communitie will darken the raritie of them in their Origi∣nall. And this was called the golden Age; (according to Plato) for the vertuous excel∣lency, of Mens naturall dispo∣sitions, and manners. world produc't; That did sustaine, Old Saturnes Rule; when He in heauen did raigne; And then liu'd Men, like Gods, in pleasure here; Indu'd with Mindes secure; from Toyles, Griefs, cleer; Nor noysom Age, made any crooked, There. Their feet went euer naked as their hands; Their Cates were blessed, seruing their Commands, With ceaselesse Plenties; All Daies, sacred made To Feasts, that surfets neuer could inuade. Thus liu'd they long; and died, as seisd with sleep; All Good things seru'd them; Fruits did euer keep, Their free fields crownd; That all abundance bore; All which; All, equall, shar'd; And none wisht more. And when the Earth had hid them; Ioues will was, The Good should into heauenly Natures passe; Yet still held state, on Earth; And , sed vt dij vtue∣bant homines. The Poet (sales Melancthon) could not, but haue some light of our Parents liues in Paradise. , cusiodes hominum: from hence the opinion springeth, that euery man hath his good An∣gel; which sort of spirits (how∣euer discredited now to attend, & direct men) Flutat in his Commentaries de oraculorum defectu, de∣fends to retaine assured Being. In this sort: As if a Man should take a∣way the inter∣iected Aire; betwixt the Earth and the Moone: That Man must like∣wise dissolue, all the coherence and actuall vni∣tie of the vni∣uerse; leauing vacuum in Me∣dio; and ne∣cessary Bond of it all; so they that admit no Genij; leaue be∣twixt God, and Men, no reaso∣nable Meane for Commerce; The Interpretatiue, and Administring facultie; (as Plato cals it) betwixt them; vtterly destroying; And withdrawing consequently; All their reciprocall, and necessarie vses. As the witches of Thessalie; are said to pluck the Moone out of her Spheare. But these men be∣ing Good; turn'd onely Good Genij; The next Age (Men being bad) turn'd in their next Be∣ing; bad Genij. Of which, after was held; A mans good, and bad Genius. Guardians were, Of all best Mortals, still suruiuing there;
Obseru'd works iust, and vniust; clad in Aire; And gliding vndiscouerd, euery where; Gaue Riches where they pleas'd; And so were reft, Nothing, of All the Royall Rule they left. The second Age; That next succeeded This; Was farre the worse; which Heauen-hous'd Deities, Of Siluer, fashiond; Not like that of Gould, In disposition; Nor so wisely Soul'd. For Children then liu'd, in their mothers Cares, (All that time growing still) A Hundred yeares: And were such great fooles, at that Age; That They, Could not, themselues, dispose a Family. And when they Youths grew; hauing reacht the Date, That rear'd their forces vp, to Mans estate; They liu'd small space; And spent it all in paine; Caus'd by their follies: Not of powre t'abstaine, From doing one another Iniurie. Nor would They worship any Deity; Nor on the holy Altars of the Blest, Any appropriate sacrifice addrest, As fits the fashion of all humane Birth. For which, Ioue angry; hid them straight in Earth; Since to the blessed Deities of Heauen, They gaue not those Respects, They should haue giuen. But when the Earth had hid these, like the rest; They then were calld, the subterrestriall blest; And in Blisse second; hauing honours then; Fit, for th'Infernall spirits, of powrefull Men. . Subterranei beati, mortales vocantur. Out of their long liues and little knowledges; These Men are supposed by our Poet; to suruiue dull and earthly spirits; For their impieties, in neglect of Religion, subiect to painefull, and bitter Death; where the former good Men, sweetly slept him out. But for the the Powers of their bodies; being fashioned of the worlds yet fresh, and vigorous matter; Their spirits that informed their bodies; are supposed secondly powerfull. And that is intended; in their recourse to earthly men; such as themselues were; furthering their affecti∣ons and ambitions to ill; for which they had honour of those Men: And, of them, were ac∣counted blest; As the former Good Genij, wereso, indeed; for Exciting Men to goodnes.
Then formd, our Father Ioue, a third Descent; Whose Age was brazen; clearely different From that of Siluer. All the Mortalls there, Of wilde Ashe fashiond; stubborne and austere; Whose Mindes, the harmefull facts of Mars affected; And Petulant Iniurie. All Meates reiected, Of Naturall fruits, and Hearbs. And these were They, That first began, that Table Cruelty, Of slaughtering Beasts; And therefore grew they fierce; And not to be indur'd, in their Commerce. Their ruthlesse Mindes, in Adamant were cut; Their strengths were dismall; And their shoulders put, In accessible hands out; ouer all Their brawny limbs, armd with a brazen wall. Their Houses all were brazen; All of Brasse, Their working Instruments; for blacke Iron was As yet vnknowne: And, these (their owne liues ending; The vast, and cold-sad house of hell-descending) No , These he o∣tendes were such rude, and powrefull men, as not onely re∣fused, (like the second sort) to do honour to the Deities; But directly re∣beld against them: And af∣fected here in Earth, celestiall Emperit.

O that, I might not liue now; To partake, The Age, that must, the fift succession make; But either Dy before; Or else were borne, When all that Age, is into ashes worne. For, that which next springs, in supply of this, . Cuius Genus est ferraum. This fift Age he onely pro∣phecied of: almost three thousand years since; which falling out in this age especial∣ly true, showes how diuine a Truth inspired him: And whe∣ther it be lawful or not, with Plato and all the formerly learned; to giue these worthiest Poets the com∣mendation of diuine. Will all of Iron, produce his families; Whose bloods, shall be so banefully Corrupt, They shall not let them sleepe; But interrupt, With Toiles, and Miseries, All their Rests, And fares. The Gods, such graue, and soule-dissecting cares, Shall steepe their Bosomes in; And yet, some Good, Will God mixe with their bad; for when the blood, Faints in their nourishment; And leaues their haire, A little gray; Ioues hand, will stop the Aire, Twixt them, and life; And take them straight away. Twixt Men, and women, shall be such foule play, In their begetting pleasures; And their Race, Spring from such false seed; That the sonnes stolne face; Shall nought be like the sires; The sire, no more, Seene in his Issue. No friend as before Shall like his friend be: Nor no Brother, rest Kinde, like his Brother: No Guest, like a Guest Of former times; No Childe, vse like a Childe, His aged Parents; But with manners wilde, Reuile, and shame them; Their Impietie, Shall neuer feare, that Gods all-seeing eye, Is fixt vpon them; But shall quite despise, Repaiment of their educations prise; quibus ius est in manibus. All this Ouid translates; Nec hospes b hospite tutus, Non socer à genero; fratrū quoque gratia ara est. Beare their law, in their hands; And when they get, Their fathers free-giuen goods; Account them debt.
Citie shall Citie ransack; Not a Grace, To any pious Man shall shew her face; Nor to a iust, or good Man. All, much more, Shall grace a Beastly, and iniurious Bore; No Right shall seise on any hand of theirs; Nor any shame make blush, their black affaires; The worse shall worse the better, with bad words; And sweare him out, of all his Right affords. Ill-lung'd; , malè seu graui∣ter soans; , Ma gaudens; vel quo mali gaudent, & de∣lectantur. Vel alienis in∣sultans calami∣tatibus. , inuiso aspectu; & truis oculis cernens: All Epithets of . Ill-liuerd, Ill-complexion'd Spight, Shall consort all the Miserable plight, Of Men then liuing. Iustice then, and Shame, Clad in pure white (as if they neuer came, In touch of those societies) shall flie, Vp to the Gods Immortall familie, From broad-way'd Earth: And leave graue griefs to Men; That (desp'rate of Amends) must beare all Then. But now to Kings, A Fable Ile obtrude, Though cleere, they sauor all it can include. The , Accipiter, The manners of the Mighty towards the Meane, are fi∣gured in this fiction. By the Nigh∣tingale; vnder∣standing, lear∣ned, and vertu∣ous Men. The following verse; , imprudens &c. followes the most sacred let∣ter, noesse re∣luctandum po∣tentioribus. Hauke once, hauing trust vp in his Seres, The sweet-tun'd Nightingale; and to the Spheres, His prey transferring: with his Tallons, she Pincht too extreamely; and incessantly, Crying, for Anguish; This imperious speech, He gaue the poore Bird; Why complainst thou wretch? One holdes thee now, that is thy Mightier far; Goe, as he guides; Though ne're so singular Thou art a Singer; It lies now in me, To make thee sup me; Or to set thee free. Foole that thou art; who euer will contend, With one, whose faculties, his owne transcend; Both failes of Conquest; And is likewise sure, Besides his wrong, He shall bad words endure. Thus spake the swift, and broad-wing'd Bird of Prey; But heare O , He speakes to his brother, and returnes to his first Proposition; of the fit contention, to which hee perswaded him before. And though shame and iustice are fled in others; yet he wisheth him to loue and embrace them. The elegant description immediately before; being truely Philosophicall, and is handled at large, by Plato, in Protagoras. thou Iustice; And hate Iniury. Wrong touches neer a miserable Man; For (though most patient) yet he hardly can
Forbeare iust words; and feele iniurious deeds; Vniust loads, vex; He hardly beares that bleeds. And yet hath Wrong, to Right; a better way: For, in the end, will Iustice winne the Day. Till which, who beares, sees then, Amends arise: The . Passus vero stultus sapit, which was since vsurpt prouerbially: signifying that wisdome to be follie, that we learne but of our owne first suffered afflicti∣ons: which yet, I think farre exceeds any wisdom that was neuer taught, nor con∣firmed by first feeling infor∣tunes, and calamities. foole first suffers, and is after wise. But , properly signifies Curuis, vl tortuosis indicijs; which (he saies) rauish together with them, Preiurie; Alluding to croo∣ked things; or things wrapt together like bram∣bles; that catch and keep with them whatsoeuer touches them. Our pro∣uerbe; to ouertake with a crooked Measure; not ridiculously applied to this graue Metaphor; , not signifying, in this place, what our Criticks teach; vid. lites iniquas; but Iudicia iniqua seutortuosa. crooked Iustice; ioyntly hookes with it, Iniurious Periury; And that vnfit Outrage, brib'd Iudges vse; that makes them drawe, The way their gifts goe; euer cuts out Lawe, By crooked Measures. Equall iustice then, All clad in Aire; th'ill Mindes of bribed Men, Comes after mourning: Mourns the Cities ill; Which where she is expell'd, shee brings in still. But those that with impartiall Doomes extend, As well to strangers, as their houshould friend The Law's pure Truth; And will in no point stray, From forth the straight Tract, of the equall way: With such, the Citie; all things Noble nourish: With such, the People, in their Profits flourish. Sweet Peace, along the Land goes; Nor to them All seeing Ioue, will destinate th'extreame Of banefull Warre. No Hunger euer comes; No ill, where Iudges vse impartiall Doomes. But Goods well got maintaine still neighbour feasts; The Fields flowe there, with lawfull Interests. On Hils, the high Oke, Acorns beares; In Dales, Th'industrious Bee her Hony sweet exhales: And ful-feld Sheep, are shorne with Festiuales; There, women bring forth children like their Sire; And all, in all kindes, finde their owne entire. Nor euer plow they vp the barren Seas, Their owne fat Fields yeeld store enough to please. But whom rude Iniurie delights, and Acts That Misery, and Tyranny contracts; Sharp-sighted Ioue, for such predestines paine; And , oftentimes, for one ill Man a whole Citie suffers; which sentence, in neare the same words, is vsed in Ecclesiastes. Saepe vni∣uersa Ciuitas, mali viri pae∣nam luit. And as before he recounts the blessings that accompany good Kings or Iudges; o here he remembers the plagues, that pursue the bad; enforcing in both (as I may say) the ebbing, or flowing of euery Common-wealth by them. For Law being soule to euery such politicke Bodie; And Iudges; as if Essence to that soule, in giuing it forme and Beeing, according to their sentences & expositions of it; The bodie politick, of force must fare well or ill, as it is gouerned, well or ill. No otherwise then, as the body of  Man, suffers good or ill; by his soules good or bad information, and discipline. These threats vsed here (saith Melancthon) as in diuerse other places of this diuine Poet; He questionless gathered out of the doctrine of Moses and the Prophets, with whom the like comminations are euery where frequent. oftentimes; The whole Land doth sustain
For one Mans wickednes; that thriuing in Inequall Doomes; still makes his sentence him. For where such Men beare priuileg'd office still; There Ioue poures downe whole deluges of ill. Famine and Pestilence together goe; The people perish; women baraine growe; Whole Houses vanish there, sometimes in peace; And sometimes Armies rais'd to shield th'increase, The Gods late gaue them: euen those Gods destroy Their Rampires ruine; and let Rapine ioy The Goods Iniustice gatherd: Or, elsewhere Ioue sinks their ships, and leaues their ventures there. , He would haue Iudges enter into considera∣tion thēselues, of the dangers in iniustice; which presently after, he redu∣ces into three arguments. The first, , sibi ipsi, which sentence, to admiration agrees to that of the Script. Incidit in foā quante fecit. The second for feire of further pu∣nishment from God. The third, he makes out of the naturall indignity, and absurdity of the thing. Weigh then your selues, this Iustice Oye Kings; For howsoeuer oft, vnequall things Obtatine their passe; they passe not so the eyes, Of all the all-discerning Deities; For close and conuersant their virtues be With Men; and how they grate each other, see, With wrested Iudgements; yeelding no cares due, To those sure wreakes, with which the Gods pursue Vnequall Iudges; Though on Earth there are, Innumerable Gods that minister, Beneath great Ioue; That keep Men clad in Aire; Corrupt Doomes noting, and each false affaire; And gliding through the Earth, are euery where; Iustice is seed to Ioue; in all fame deare, And reuerend to the Gods, inhabiting Heauen; And still a Virgin; whom when Men ill giuen, Hurt, and abhorring from the right, shall wrong; She for redresse; to Ioue her sire complaines, Of the vniust minde, euery man sustaines; And prayes the people may repay the paines Their Kings haue forfaited, in their offences; Deprauing Iustice, and the genuine senses, Of lawes corrupted, in their sentences. Obseruing this, ye Gift-deuouring Kings; Correct your sentences; and to their springs, Remember euer to reduce those streames, Whose crooked courses euery Man condemnes.
Whoeuer forgeth, for another, ill; With it, himselfe is ouertaken still; In ill, Men runne on that they most abhor; Ill counsell, worst is to the Councelor. For Ioues eye, all things seeing, and knowing all; Euen these things, if he will; of force must fall Within his sight, and knowledge; Nor to him: Can these brib'd Domes, in Cities shine so dim, But he discernes them; and will pay them paine: Else would not I liue iustly amongst Men; Nor to my Iustice frame my children; If to be iust, is euer to be ill; And that the vniust findes most iustice still; And Ioue gaue each Man in the end his will. But he that loues the lightning (I conceiue) To these things thus, will no conclusion giue. , He perswades his brother to the loue of Iustice, by ar∣gument taken from the true nature of Man. That by vertue of his diuine soule, naturally loues it. Be∣cause God in∣fused into that diuine Beam of his, being im∣mortall; a loue to that, that preseru'd im∣mortalities; without that immortall de∣struction af∣fected in ini∣stice. Fishes, Beasts, and Foules, indued naturally with no such loue to Iustice; but allowed by God, to doe like themselues and deuore one ano∣ther, which that men should doe, as well as they; is most inhumane, and full of confusion; as well in their deformed mixture, as in the Ruine that inseparably followes it. But his confidence here, that whosoeuer will doe Iustice freely, and without respect of riches; God will enrich him; And that the worse enclined, will feele it in the Hell of his conscience; The others eed prospe∣ring beyond himselfe; Is truly, religious and right Christian, Howeuer Perses, put these in thy heart; And to the equity of things conuert Thy Mindes whole forces; all thought striking dead; To that foule Rapine, that hath now such heade. For in our Manhoods, Ioue hath Iustice clos'd; And as a law, vpon our soules impos'd: Fish, Foule, and sauage Beasts; whose (Law is power) Ioue lets each other mutually deuoure; Because they lack the equity he giues To gouerne Men; as, farre best for their liues; And therefore Men should follow it with striues. For he that knowes the iustice of a Cause; And will in publike Ministrie of Lawes, Giue sentence to his knowledge; Be he sure, God will enrich him. But who dares abiure His conscious knowledge; and belie the lawe; Past cure, will that wound in his Conscience drawe. And for his radiance now, his Race shall be The deeper plung'd in all obscurity.
The iust mans state, shall in his seed exceed; And, after him, breed honours as they breed. But, why mens ills preuaile so much with them; I, that the Good know, will vnclowd the Beame, In whose light lies the reason; with much ease, To vice, and her loue, Men may make accesse; Such crewes in Rout, Herd to her, and her Court So passing neare lies; Their way sweet and short; , Ante virtutem. His argument to perswade to vertue, here is taken both from her owne naturall Fate; and the diuine disposition of God. For as she hath a body (being sup∣posed the ver∣tue of Man) and through the worthily exercised and instructed or∣ganes of that bodie; Her soule receiues her excitation to all her ex∣pressible know∣ledge; (for dati sunt sensus, ad excitandum intellectum) so to the loue and habite of knowledge, and vertue, there is first necessarily required, a laborious and painefull conflict; fought through the know∣ledge, and hae of the miseries and beastlinesse of vice. And this paineful passage to Vertue Vir∣gil imitated in his translation of the Pythagorean letter, Y. , or sudr, is to be vnderstood of sweat, ex labore & fatigatione rt. But before Vertue, doe the Gods raine sweat, Through which, with Toile, and halfe-dissolued feet, You must wade to her; her path long and steep; And at your entry, tis so sharp and deep. But scaling once her height, the ioy is more, Than all the paine she put you to before. The paine at first then, both to loue and knowe Iustice and Vertue; and those few that goe Their rugged way; is cause tis followed lest. . Hee tels hee. who is at all parts the best and happiest Man; which Virgil. euen to a word almost recites; and therefore more than imitates, in this; Felix qui potuit verum cognoscere cansas &c. wherein our diuine and all-teaching Poet, since, describes three sorts of Men; One that loues vertue out of knowledge acquired and elaborate; which the Philosopher calls scientiam acquisitam; The second, th loues her out of ad∣monition; which he calls infuam scientiam; The third, is hee, that hath neither of those two knowledges; no is capable of either; hauing both these ignorances in him; viz. Ignorantiam pranae disposition, and purae negationis. Liie, as well as Virgil, recites this place almost ad verbum, in Fabio & Minuti; In these words, Saepe ego audini, milites, eum primum ess virum, qui ipse consulat, quid in remsit: secundum eum, qui bene monei obediat: Qui nec ipse consolere, nec alt ri¦parere scit, eum extromi ingenij esse. Of all Men therefore, he is alwaies best, That not depending on the mightiest, Nor on the most; hath of him selfe descried, All things becomming; and goes fortified, In his owne knowledge, so farre, as t' intend What now is best; and will be best at th'end. Yet hee is good too, and enough doth know, That onely followes, being admonisht how: But hee that neither of himselfe can tell, What fits a man; nor being admonisht well, Will giue his minde to learne; but flat refuse; That man, cast out from euery humane vse.
Doe thou then, euer in thy Memory place My precepts Perses, sprung of sacred Race; And worke out what thou knowst not: that with hate Famine may prosecute thy full estate; And rich-wreath'd Ceres (reuerenc't of all,) Loue thee as much; and make her festiuall, Amids thy Granaries: Famine euermore Is naturall consort of the idle Boore. Whoeuer idly liues, both Gods, and Men Pursue with hatefull and still-punishing spleene. The slothfull man is like the sting-lesse Drone, That all his powre, and disposition, Emploies to rob the labours of the Bee; And with his sloth, deuoure her Industrie. Doe thou repose thy speciall pleasure then, In still being conuersant, with temperate paine; That to thee still, the Seasons may send home Their vtmost store. With Labour Men become Herd-full, and rich; with labour thou shalt proue Great, both in humane, and the Deities loue. One, with another, all combin'd in one, Hate with infernall horror, th'idle Drone. Labour▪ and thriue; and th' idle 'twill inflame. No shame to labor; sloth is yok't with shame. Glorie and vertue into consort fall With wealth; wealth God-like winnes the grace of all. Since which, yet, springs out of the root of paine; , laborare autm melius. Notwithstan∣ding he hath no other way to perswade his vnwise brother to follow his busines, and leaue his strife in law for other Mens goods▪ but to propose wealth, and ho∣nour for the fruits of it: yet he prefers labor alone, ioind with loue of vertue and Iu∣stice, and the good expence of a mans time; before wealth, and honour with Couetous∣nes and Conten∣tion. Paine hath praecedence; so thou dost maintaine The temper fitting; and that foolish vaine Of striuing for the wealth of other Men, Thou giu'st no vent; but on thine owne affaires Conuert'st thy Minde; and thereon laiest thy cares. And then put on, with all the spirit, you can. Shame is not good in any needy Man. Shame much obscures, and makes as much to fame. Wealth loues Audacity; Want fauours Shame. Riches, not rauisht, but diuinely sent For virtuous labour, are most permanent. If any stand on force, and get wealth so; Or with the tongue, spoile, as a number doe;
When Gaine, or Craft doth ouergoe the soule; And Impudence doth honest shame contoule; God easely can the so-made-great disgrace; And his House, raisd so, can as easely race. Riches beare Date, but of a little space. , Par est delictū. He iae it is as great a sinne; to wrong a poor suppliant, as to wrong a man: best friend or Guest. Which was then held one of the greatest impieties. And to deceiue an Orphane of his dead parents gift, he affirmes to be nothing lesse an offence than to ascend to the bed of his brother. Not that hee makes all sins alike; but shews how horrible those sins are, with which wee are most fami∣liar. Who wrongs an humble suppliant, doth offend▪ As much as he, that wrongs a Guest, or friend. Who, for his brothers wifes loue, doth ascend His brothers bed; and hath his vicious end; Offends no more than he, that doth deceiue An Orphane, of the goods his Parents leaue; Or he that in the wretched bounds of Age, Reuiles his Father. All these Ioue enrage; And shall receiue of Him reuenge at last, Inflicting all paines, that till then they past. From all these therefore, turne thy striuing Minde, And to thy vtmost, see the Gods assign'd Chastly, and purely; all their holy dues. Burne fattest thighes to them; and sometimes vse Off'rings of wine. Sometimes, serue their delights, With burning incense: both, when bed-time cites; And when from bed, the sacred Morning cals. That thou maist render the Celestialls, All waies propitious: And so, none else gather, Thy fortunes strow'd; but thou reape others rather. Suffer thy foe thy table; call thy friend. In chiefe, one neere; for if Occasion send Thy householde vse of Neighbours; they vndrest Will hast to thee; where thy Allies will rest, Till they be ready. An ill Neighbour is A curse: a good one is as great a blisse. He hath a treasure, by his fortune sign'd; That hath a Neighbour of an honest minde. No losse of Oxe, or Horse, a Man shall beare; Vnlesse a wicked Neighbour dwell too neare. Iust Measure take of Neighbours, iust repay; The same receiu'd and more; If more thou may. That after, needing; thou maiest after, finde Thy wants supplier, of as free a minde. , mala lucra ae∣qualiai damnis. According to this of the Scripture; Male portum male disperit; Et, de male que∣sitis non gaudit tertius haeres. Take no ill gaine, ill gaine brings losse as ill.
Aid quit with aid: goodwill pay with goodwill; Giue him that hath giuen; him that hath not, giue not▪ Giuers, Men giue; Gifts to no giuers thriue not. Giuing is good: Rapine is deadly ill. Who freely giues, though much, reioyceth still; Who rauines, is so wretched, that though small His forst gift be; he grieues, as if twere all. Little to little added, it oft done, In small time makes a great possession. Who addes to what is got; needs neuer feare, tram famem. Black or swarh he cals Famine, or Hungr; ab effectu, quod nigrum, aut lu∣cidum colorem inducat. That swarth-chek't Hunger will deuoure his cheare. Nor will it hurt a Man; though something more, Hee las it will not hurt a man, to haue a little more than needs meerely, laid vp at home; A we say; it will eat a man no mea. And prefers keeping a mans store at home; to put∣ting it forth; for it may go lesse so, as often it doth. Than serues meere need; he laies at home in store. And, best at home: it may go lesse abroad. If cause call forth; at home prouide thy Rode, Enough for all needs, for free spirits dy, To want, being absent from their owne supplie. incipiente dolio. At the beginning, or height of a mans store, hee aduiseth liberality; And at the bottome. In the midst frugality. Admonishing therein not to be prodigall nor sordid; or wretched: But as at the top of the Cask, wie is the weakest, and thinnest; because it is most neer the aire; and therefore may there be best spent; at the bottome full of lees; and so may there be best spared; In the midst nearest and briskest, and should bee then most made of, or busbnded; so in the midst of a Mans purse, he aduiseth parsimoy. Which note, I charge thee. At thy purses height, And when it fights lowe; giue thy vse his freight; When in the midst thou art, then checke the blood; Frugalitie at bottome is not good. testem adhilto. The Criticks expound it; as if a man talking priuatly and liberally with his brother, should confesse so securely; that he must euer bring a witnesse with him, of what words past him, and the Criticks intend it personally; where the word  signifies heere onely, suputa, cogita, hypothetically, or by way of supposition;  comming of , i , et , faci, esto vt ita sit, suppose there were a witnesse by; and be as circumspect in speeches with your brother, euen in your most priuate and free discourse, as if you supposed a third Man heard you. The other exposition is to be exploded. Euen with thy brother, thinke a witnesse by; When thou wouldst laugh, or conuerse liberally; Despaire hurts none, beyond Credulitie. , qui vel quae  exrnat.

And that house to all height his riches reares, Whose sire dies ould, and leaues a son of yeares. To many children too, God easely spares Wealth store; but still, more children the more cares.

And yet hee addes most grauely and pi∣ously, that God can easiely giue store of Goods, fit for the greatest store of children; but yet, the more children the more care; and speaking to the happiest state of a familie; he prefers one sup∣plier to many. , sic facito.

And therefore pre∣scbe allow∣ance of bread to his meales, something ex∣traordinarie: saying, hee would haue allowed foure shiues of bread at a meale to his meat; euery shiue contai∣ning eight bits or morsels; Not that the whole foure shiues should containe but eight morsels, as the Critiks expound it. For how absurd is it to imagine, a shiue of bread but two bits? And how pin∣ching a diet it were for an able Plow-man? Whose bread at Meales, in foure good shiuers cut; Eight bits in euery shiue; for that Man, put To his fit taske; will see it done past talke, With any fellowe; Nor will euer Balke In any stitch he makes; but giue his Minde, Whith care t' his labour. And this Man, no Hinde, (Though much his younger) shall his better be, At sowing Seed; and shunning skilfullie, , Qui quidem opus curans, &c▪ aetatis quam in serus requirit (saies Melan∣cthon) rationes addit admdum graues, sentitque mutum situm esse, in maturitate tatis. Forty yeares then, being but a youths ae Need to go ouer his whole worke againe. Your younger Man, feeds still a flying vaine, From his set taske; to holde his equalls chat; And trifles workes, he should be serious at. Take notice then, when thou the Crane shalt heare Aloft, out of the Clowds her changes reare; That then he giues thee signall when to sowe, And winters wrathfull Season doth foreshowe. And then the Man, that can no Oxen get; Or wants the Seasons worke; his heart doth eat. Then feed thy Oxen, in the house with Hay; Which he that wants; with ease enough will say, Let me, alike, thy Waine and Oxen vse▪ Which tis as easie for thee to refuse; And say, thy Oxeworke then importunes much. He that is rich in Braine, will answer such; Worke vp thy selfe, a Waggon of thine owne; For to the foolish borrower, is not knowne, That each Waine askes a hundred ioynts of wood; These things aske forecast; and thou shouldest make good At home, before thy need so instant stood. When therefore, first, fit plow time doth disclose; Put on with spirit; All, as one, dispose Thy seruants, and thy selfe: plow wet and drie; And when Aurora first affords her eye, In Spring-time turne the earth vp; which see done, Againe, past all faile, by the Summers Sunne. Hasten thy labours, that thy crowned fields, May load themselues to thee; and rack their yeelds.

When first thou enterst foot to plow thy land, And on thy plow-staffes top hast laid thy hand; Thy Oxens backs, that next thee, by a Chaine Thy Oken-draught Tree drawe; put to the paine Thy Goad imposes. And thy Boy behinde, That with his Iron Rake thou hast design'd, To hide thy seed; Let from his labour driue, The Birds, that offer on thy sweat to liue. The best thing, that in humane Needs doth fall, Is Industry; and Sloath the worst of all. With one, thy Corne eares, shall with fruit abound; And bow their thankfull forheads to the ground; With th' other; scarce thy seed againe redound. When Ioue then giues this good end to thy paine; Amids the Vessels that preserue thy Graine, No Spiders then, shall need t'vsurp their roome, But thou (I thinke) reioyce, and rest at Home; Prouision Inn'd enough of euery thing, To giue thee glad heart, till the neighbour Spring; Not goe to others to supply thy store, But others, need to come to thee for more.

Thou shouldst be then, Coop't in a Basket vp; for worldly Men, Admire no vnthrifts: Honour goes by gaine. As times still change, so changeth Ioue his Minde, Whose Seasons, mortall Men can hardly finde. But if thou shouldst sowe late, this well may be, In all thy slacknesse, an excuse for thee.

When once the Thistle doth his flower prefer; And on the Tree, the garrulous Grashopper, Beneath her wings; all Day, and all Night long, Sits pouring out, her derisorie song; When Labour drinks, his boyling sweat to thriue: Then Gotes grow fat; then best wine chuse; then striue Women for worke most; and Men least can do; For then, the Dog-starre, burns his drouth into, Their braines, and knees, and all the Bodie dries; But then, betake thee, to the shade that lies, , Biblinum viū▪ dicitur a Biblia Rgione Trciae vbi nobilisima ina sunt.

But after, that the Seuen-stars, and the Fiue, That twixt the Bulls hornes, at their set arriue; Together with the great Orions force; Then plie thy Plough, as fits the Seasons course. , qui de sorte sua quaeritur. If, of a Chance-complaining Man, at Seas, The humor take thee; when the Pleiades, Hide head, and flie the fierce Orions, chace; And the darke-deep Oceanus embrace; Then diuerse Gusts of violent windes arise; And then attempt, no Nauall enterprise. But ply thy Land affaires; and draw ashore, Thy Ship; and fence her round, with stonage store, To shield her Ribs, against the humorous Gales; Her Pump exhausted, lest Ioues rainie falls, Breed putrefaction. All tooles fit for her; And all her tacklings, to thy House confer; Contracting orderly, all needfull things, That Imp a water-treading Vessels wings. Her well-wrought Sterne, hang in the smoke at home, Attending time, till fit Sea Seasons come. And then thy swift Saile lanch, conueying in, Burthen, that richly way that Trade begin; As did our Father; who a voiage went, For want of an Estate so competent, As free life askt; and long since landed here; When he had measur'd the vnmeasur'd Spheere, Of all the Sea; Aeoliam Cumas leauing; , non red∣ditus, s diui∣tias fugiens. Hee blames those that ha∣uing richly e∣nough of their owne; which they freely and safely possesse ashore; will yet with insati∣ate desire of more, venture the losse of all; which his father (he saies) was not to be blamed for; in going to Sea; who one∣ly tooke that course to auoid Pouertie; his meanes by Land not enough, to liue withall, freely. Not flying wealth (Reuenews great receiuing;
And Blisse it selfe possest, in all fit store; If wisely vsde; yet selling that t'explore Strange Countries, madly couetous of more; But onely shunning lothsome Pouertie; Which yet Ioue sends, and Men should neuer flie.

For whose vse allow A little Ship; but in her bulke bestow, A great bigge Burthen; the more Ships sustaine, The surer saile they; and heap Gaine on Gaine: If Seas run smooth, and rugged Gusts abstaine.

Though neither skild, in either Ship, or Saile, Nor euer was at Sea; Or, lest I faile, But for Euboea once; from Aulis where The Greeks, with Tempest driuen, for shore did stere Their mighty Nauie, gatherd to employ, For sacred Greece; gainst faire-dame-breeding Troy; To Chalcis there, I made by Sea my Passe; , King of Euboea, was shine in Battell, against the Erythreans. At whose Funerals, his soones instituted Games.

And to the Games of great Amphidamas; Where many afore-studied Exercise, Was instituted, with excitefull prise, For great-and-good, and able-minded Men: And where I wonne, at the Pierean Pen, A three-ear'd Tripod, which I offerd on, The Altars of the Maids of Helicon.
Where first their loues initiated me, In skill of their vnworldly Harmony. But no more practise haue my trauailes swet, In many-a-naile-composed ships; and yet, Ile sing what Ioues Minde will suggest in mine, Whose daughters taught my verse the rage diuine. Fifty daies after Heauens conuerted heate, When Summers land-works are dissolu'd with sweat; Then growes the nauigable season fit: For then no stormes rise, that thy saile may split, Nor spoile thy sailers. If the God that swaies Th'earth-shaking Trident, doe not ouerpaise, With any counsaile, before hand decreed, The seasons naturall grace, to thy good speed; Nor Ioue consent with his reuengefull will; In whom are fixt the bounds of good and ill. But in the vsuall temper of the yeare, Easie to iudge of, and distinguish cleare, Are both the windes▪ and seas; none rude, none crosse, Nor mis-affected with the loue of losse. And therefore put to sea; trust euen the winde Then, with thy swift ship; but when thou shalt finde Fit freight for her; as fitly stowe it strait; And all haste home make. For no new wine waite, Nor aged Autumnes showres; nor winters falls, Then fast approaching; Nor the noisome gales, The humorous South breathes, that incense the seas, , Coelestem imbr secutus; inten∣ding a follow∣ing of those things quae se∣rie quadam con∣tinuase sequun∣tur. And raise together in one series Ioues Autumne dashes, that come smoking downe, And with his roughest brows make th'Ocean frowne. But there's another season for the seas, That in the first spring others choices please; When, looke how much the Crowe takes at a stride, So much, put forth, the yong leafe is descride On Fig-tree tops. But then the gusts so fall, That oft the sea becomes imperviall. And yet this vernall season many vse, For sea affaires; which yet, I would not chuse; Nor giues it my minde any gratefull taste, Since then steales out so many a rauenous blast;
Nor, but with much skath thou canst scape thy bane, Which yet, Mens greedy follies dare maintaine; Mony is soule to miserable Men: And to it many Men their soules bequeath. To dy in darke-seas is a dreadfull death. All this I charge thee, need to note no more; Nor in one vessell venture all thy store; But most part leaue out, and impose the lesse; For tis a wretched thing t'indure distresse Incurr'd at sea. And, tis as ill, ashore To vse aduentures, couetous of more Than safety warrants; As, vpon thy Waine To lay on more load than it can sustaine. For then, thy Axle breakes, thy goods diminish, And Thrifts meane meanes in violent Au'rice vanish. The Meane obseru'd, makes an exceeding slare. Occasion tooke at all times, equalls Fate.

But keepe thou friends, forgiue, and so conuert, That not thy looke may reprehend thy heart. Be not a common host for guests, nor one That can abide the kinde receipt of none. Consort none ill, though rais'd to any state; Nor leaue one good; though n'ere so ruinate.

He would haue no contempt a∣gainst the sun; either directly, or allegorically intending by the sun, great & reuerend men: against whom, nihil proteruè, et irreuerenter a∣gendum, If in the plain sense; which he makes serious, he would not haue a Man make water turning pur∣posely against the sun, nor standing, but sitting, as at this day euen a∣mongst the rude Turkes it is abhorred, Quibus religio∣sum est vt se∣dentes mingant, et ingens flagiti∣um designari credunt siquis in publico cacaret aut mingeret.And after the great Sunne is in descent, Remember, till he greet the Orient, That, in way, or without, thou still forbeare.

Make no accesse (Thy wife new left) to sacred mysteries; Or coming from an ominous funerall feast; But from a banquet that the Gods haue blest In Men whose spirits are frolikely inclinde; Performe those rights that propagate thy kinde. Neuer, the faire waues of eternall flouds, Passe with thy feet, but first inuoke the Gods; Thine eies cast on their streames; Which those that wade, (Their hands vnwasht) those Deities inuade With future plagues: and euen then angrie are. , hee saies a man must not pare his nailes at the Table, in which our reuerend Author is so respectfull and morall in his setting downe, that hee nameth not nailes, but calls what is to be pared away  siccum, or aridum, and the naile it selfe  because it is still growing, he cals likewise the hand  or quae in quinos ramo dispergitur, because it puts out fiue fingers, like branches. Of thy fiue branches, see thou neuer pare The dry from off the greene, at solemne feasts: Nor on the quaffing Mazers of thy guests Bestow the boawle vowd, to the powres diuine; For harmefull fate is swallow'd with the wine. When thou hast once begun to build a house, Leau't not vnfinisht, lest the Ominous, Ill-spoken Crowe, encounter thee abroad, And from her bow, thy meanes outgone, explode. From three-foot pots of meat, set on the fire To serue thy house; serue not thy tasts desire With rauine of the Meate, till on the borde Thou seest it set and sacrifice afforde. Not if thou wash first, and the Gods wouldst please With that respect to them: for euen for these, Paines are imposde, being all Impieties.

If any homely place, Syluane, or other, thou seest vowd to grace Of any God, by fire made for the weale Of any poore soule, mou'd with simplest zeale; Mock not the mysteries: for God disdaines Those impious parts, and paies them certaine paines.

Accor∣ding to that of Quntilian writing to Se∣neca affirming he cared no more what the misiudging world vented a∣gainst him, quā de vent redditi crepitus. Do this, and flie the peoples bitter fame, For Fame is ill: tis light and rais'd like flame; The burthen heauie yet, and hard to cast. No fame doth wholly perish, when her blast Eccho resounds in all the peoples cries, For she her selfe, is of the Deities. The end of the second Booke of works.
HESIODS BOOKE OF DAYES. THe Daies, that for thy workes, are Good, or Ill, According to the Influence, they instill; Of Ioue with all care, learne, and giue them then, (For their discharge) in precept to thy Men. The thirtith Day of euery Moneth, is best , diligèti inspecti∣one digero, seu seceru & ligo. He beginnes with the last day of the Moneth, which he names not a day of any good, or bad influence; but being (as twere) their Terme Day; in which their businesse in Lawe was attended: And that, not lasting all the Day; He aduiseth to spend the rest of it, in dis∣posing the next Moneths labours. Of the rest, hee makes difference; shewing which are infor∣tunate, and which auspicious; and are so farre to be obserued, as naturall cause is to be giuen for them; for it were madnesse, not to ascribe Reason to Nature; or to make that Reason so farre a∣boue vs, that we cannot know by it, what is daily in vse with vs; all beeing for our cause created of God: And therefore the differences of Dies, arise in some part from the Aspects; quibus Lu∣na intuetur solem Nam quadrati aspctus cient pugnam Naturae cum morb. With diligent inspection, to digest The next Moneths workes; and part thy house-hould foods: That being the Day, when all litigious Goods, Are iustly sentenc't, by the peoples voyces. And till that Daie, next Moneth, giue these Daies choyces; For they are markt out, by most-knowing Ioue. , primum Nouilunium; which he calls sacred; nam omnia initia sacra. The fourth likewise, hee calls sacred, quia eo die prodit a cui Luna, primumque tum conspicitur. First, the first Day, in which the Moone doth mooue, With radiance renu'd. And then, the fourth, The seuenth Day, next; being first in sacred worth: For that Day, did Latona bring to light, , The second, and fift day, let psse, and sixt; vt medijs; he comes to the eighth, & ninth, which in their encreasing he tearms truely profitable; Nam humores alit crescentia Luna. The gould-sword-wearing Sun. Next then the eightth,
And ninth, are Good; being both, Daies that retaine The Moones prime strength, t'instruct the works of Men. , The tenth let passe; the ele∣uenth, and twelfth, he prai∣ses diuersely; because the Moone be∣holdes the Sunne then in a triangulare aspect; which is euer called beneuolent. The leauenth, and twelfth, are likewise both Good Daies; The twelfth yet, farre exceeds, the 'leuenths repaire; For that Day hangs the Spinner in the Aire; And weaues her web vp. So the Spinster, all Her Rock then ends, exposing it to sale. So Earth's third Huswife, the ingenious Ant, On that Day ends her Mole-hils cure of want. The Day her selfe, in their example then, Tasking her fire, and bounds her length to Men. The thirteenth Day, take care thou sowe no seed; To plant yet, tis a Day of speciall speed. The sixteenth Day, Plants set, prooue fruitlesse still; To get a Sonne tis good, a Daughter ill. , eque uptijs trudendis The sixteenth Day, he saies, is nei∣ther good to get a Daugh∣ter, nor to wed her; quia à plenilunio coepit iam humor defi∣cere. He saies, tis good to get a Sonne in, nam ex humido semi∣ne s nellae:  sictiore, puelli nacuntur. Nor good to get, nor giue in Nuptials; Nor in the sixt Day, any Influence falls, To fashion her begetting Confluence. But to geld Kids, and Lambs, and Sheep-coats fence; It is a Day of much beneuolence: To get a Sonne, it good effects affords; , eor alcui scin∣deus. And loues to cut ones heart, with bitter words. And yet it likes faire speeches too, and lies; And whispering out detractiue obloquies. The eight, the bellowing Bullock lib, and Gote; The twelfth, the labouring Mule; but if of note, , prudentem ver ud cem, seu Arbitrm quod eoignaos esse oporteat rei de qua agitur; He calls t the great  wth, be∣cause it is the last, , which is of the middle Ded of the Moneth; diebus , or daies of the dying moone immediatly following. For wisedome, and to make a Iudge of Lawes; To estimate, and arbitrate a Cause, Thou wouldst a Sonne get, the great twentith Day, Consort thy wife, when full the Morns broad Ray, Shines through thy windowes: for that Day is fit, To forme a great, and honourable wit. The tenth is likewise good, to get a Son; . The fourteenth is good to get a Daughter; because the Moone then abounds in humours; and her light is more geld & cold; her heat more temperate. And therefore he saies, tis good likewise, to tame Beast in, since then, by the abundance of humous, they are made more gentle, & consequently, easier tamed. Fourteenth a Daughter; then lay hand vpon The Colt, the Mule, and horne-retorted Stere; And sore-bit Mastiffe; and their forces rere,
To vsefull seruices. Be carefull then, , He calls this day so banefull; because of the opposition of Sunne and the Moone; and the time then being, that is, between the old and new Moone; are hurtfull for bodies, such as labour with cholerick disea∣ses; most lan∣guish then: Those with Phlegmatick contrary. The foure and twentith Day, (the bane of Men, Hurling amongst them) to make safe thy State; For tis a Day, of Death insatiate. The fourth Day, celebrate thy Nuptiall feast, All Birds obseru'd, that fit a Bridall best. , He warnes Men to flie all fif Daies; that is, the fift, the the fifteenth, and the fiue & twentith; be∣cause all venge∣full spirits he affirmes then to be most bu∣sie with Men. All fift Daies, to effect affaires in, flie; Being all of harsh and horrid qualitie. For then, all vengefull spirits walke their Round, And haunt Men like their hand-maids; to confound Their faithles peace; whose plague Contention got. The seuenteenth Day, what Ceres did allot Thy Barnes in Haruest (since then view'd with care) The seuen∣teenth day, he thinketh best to vinow, or dight Corne à pleniluni▪ be∣cause about that time, winds are stirred vp, and the Aire is drier. Vpon a smooth floore; let the vinnoware, Dight, and expose, to the opposed Gale. Then, let thy Forrest-feller, cut thee all Thy Chamber fuell; and the numerous parts Of Nauall timber, apt for Ship-wrights Arts. The foure and twentith Day, begin to close , prima noa. That is, from the beginning of the Moneth; he cals harmelesse; proptergeminum aspectum, cum sol abest a signis. Thy Ships of leake. The ninth Day neuer blowes Least ill at all on Men. The ninteenth Day, Yeelds (after Noone yet) a more gentle Ray; Auspicious, both to plant, and generate Prouerb nll dies omni mal. Both Sonnes and Daughters; ill to no estate. But the thrice ninth Daies Goodnes, few Men know▪ Being best Day of the whole Moneth, to make flow Both wine, and Corne-tuns; and to curb the force Of Mules and Oxen and the swift-hoou'd Horse. , Hee saies, few obserue these differences of daies; and as few know, or make any dif∣ference betwixt one day and another. And then, the well-built Ship lanch. But few men, Know truth in any thing. Or where, or when To doe, or order, what they must doe, needs: Daies differencing, with no more care than deeds. The twice seuenth Day (for sacred worth) exceeds. But few Men, when the twentith Day is past, Which is the best Day (while the Morne doth last
In her increasing power; though after Noone, He saies, few approue those daies, be∣cause these cause most change of tempests, and Mens bodies, in the beginning of the last quar∣ter. Her grace growes faint) approue, or end that Moone, All this, and the liues of Foules, is cited out of this Au∣thor by Plu∣tarch; not be∣ing extant in the common Copie. With any Care; Mans life, most pris'd, is least: Though lengthlesse; spent as endless. Fowle and Beast Farre passing it, for Date. For all the store Of yeares, Man boasts; the prating Crowe hath more, By thrice three liues. The long-liu'd Stagge, foure parts, Exceeds the Crowes Time; the Rauens Age; the Harts, Triples in durance; all the Rauens long Date, The Phoenix, ninefolde doth reduplicate. Yet Nymphs (the blest seed of the Thunderer) Ten liues out-last the Phoenix. But preferre Good life, to long life; and obserue these Daies, That must direct it; being to all Mens waies , Et hae quidem des hominibus sunt magno commodo. The Epilogue of the Teacher; in all Daies is to be considerd what Religion commands, & then what ri∣seth out of na∣turall Causes. Of excellent conduct. All the rest but sound's, That follow falls; meere vaine and haue no grounds: But, one doth one Day praise; another, other; Few knowing the truth. This Day becomes a Mother; The next, a Step-dame. But, be Man still one; That Man a happy Angell waites vpon; Makes rich, and blessed, that through all these Daies Is knowingly emploid. In all his waies, (Betwixt him and the Gods) goes still vnblam'd. All their forewarnings, and suggestions fram'd, To their obedience; being directly view'd: All Good endeauour'd, and all Ill eschew'd. The end of Hesiods Works, and Daies.
