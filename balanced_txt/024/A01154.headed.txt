A true discourse of all that hath happened in the most Christian Kings Armie since the ariuall of the Duke of Parma in France, and the ioyning of his forces with the enemie, vntill the fif∣teenth daie of this present mo∣neth of September. 1590. AFter that great and happie victorie which it pleased God to giue the King against his enemies néere to Eury the fourtéenth of March last past, he also vouch∣safed to grant him such peculiar fauour (vnto conquerors not vsuall) as therby to be no whit puffed vp either in déede or word, but contrariwise to growe the more gracious and tractable, as may appeare in his releasing of a great part of the rigour of his Edicts and declarations against his rebellious townes & subiects after the said victory more then be∣fore. Which cause was worth vnto him fiftene or six∣tene good cities & townes, whereof only one held out the batterie, and all the rest yéelded vppon friendly composition, and haue since continued most firme, constant, and resolute in his seruice, as hauing tried that transferring themselues from a tyranous vsur∣pation to a lawfull dominion, their state was greatly
amended. A fewe daies after this ouerthrowe, the Lord of Villeroy one of the chiefe of the contrarie faction, séeming desirous to reclaime himselfe, and to prouide for his particular safetie, drewe néere to Mant, where through his maiesties permission he had some communication with Monsieur du Plessis Mor∣nay, who for his part vsed him wt such fauorable spée∣ches concerning not onely his own particular cause, but also the generall, that he fained himselfe willing to enterprise some treatie of peace. Afterward he re∣turned openly while the siege laie about Melune, and albeit his maiestie were aduertised that this his le∣gation was nothing but deceit: also that the Embas∣sadour might bee first deceiued, yet with this onelie confidence, that with his sole discretion and franchize he might conuert them from their bad purposes into contrarie resolutions, as many times it hath fallen out, that set conspiracies haue ben confounded by the innocent presence of those against whom they should haue bene put in execution, he forbare not to receiue him with as great humanitie, as if he had bene assu∣red that his Commission imported as good purposes, as he was certaine of the contrarie, whereby the said Lord of Villeroy found himselfe so surprized, that hée did halfe confesse this his conuersion, and protested that hee woulde more faithfully emploie himselfe thereabouts then before hee had done. In the meane time his Maiestie hauing in a short space recouered all that laie vpon the riuers of Sein, Marne, Yonne, and Oyse, he determined to drawe néere vnto the Ci∣tie of Paris (in purpose to recouer it, and to roote out the rebellion in the same place where it first began, yet with a milde and naturall death deuoide of vio∣lence, terror or conuulsion) which he found so weak∣ly defended, that he might haue carried it with as
small labour as anie of the least towns in his king∣dome: which his abilitie continued the space of foure moneths that he enuironed it, yea it not onely so con∣tinued, but became daily more easie in yt they yt were within, had towarde the end lost three parts of their men of seruice, and his maiesties armie was streng∣thened and augmented the one halfe: howbeit so oft as it came to deliberation, (as there might be diuer∣sitie of Councels) his maiestie considering that Paris was the head Citie and principall ornament of his Realme: that therein remained so many Princesses that were allied vnto him, so many good and ancient families, so many Churches and religious houses, with persons appertaining to the seruice of the same, who for the most part peraduenture were innocent of this rebellion, and yet the said towne being taken by force, could not be exempt or fréed from such ex∣cesse and violence as in so furious an accident can no waie be eschued, could neuer bee induced to consent to that resolution before he had attempted all other meanes: yea hardly would he grant to take the sub∣urbes, not as a matter vnnecessarie to be done, but for feare least the one might draw on the other: Also that the souldiers séeing themselues so néere to so good a bootie, should haue ben hardly restrained from pro∣céeding farther, as in déed it was the greatest labour that the king and the chiefest of his Captaines had during the whole siege, to restraine their souldiours from anie farther enterprise: for there was no diffe∣rence to be made betwéene the attempting to execute it and the taking of the suburbes, which was perfor∣med at once without anie resistance. Also that which since hath bene séene, albeit repugnant to rule, viz. that the lesse containeth not the greater, yet seuen or eight thousand souldiers that lodged in the suburbs,
kept inclosed aboue thirty thousand armed men that were in the sayd towne, ought to be proofe sufficient, that the taking thereof perforce could not haue béene auoided. Herevpon his Maiestie, to the end not to lose the said town, but to preserue the honor of so many fami∣lies, and to spare the shedding of such innocent blood as might haue bin spilt, resolued to tame them with want of foode, and rather with patience to beare out the delay of whatsoeuer siege, then to practise any farther indeuour: wherein he had two purposes, either that it would fall out through the said siege, that vpon the said want, they that were within should not be able to hold out, or else that the Duke of Maine would approch to their succour, whereby he might haue oportunitie to fight with him, which was the thing that he most desired, as séeking there∣by rather to plucke vp the roote of the mischiefe, then to cut off the branches. And had his maiestie béene as resolute and implacable in the first, as he hath shewed himselfe most carefull in ye second, the towne had vndoubtedly bene his. Indéede the reason of war willeth that being once resolued to fight and conquer the obstinacie of the besieged with fasting and ab∣stinence, we should not suffer any victuals whatso∣euer to be brought in by any whomsoeuer, also that we should shut in al that were within and not suffer any, so much as one, to come forth, to the end that the more there were within, the sooner the victuals might be consumed: and this rule ought to haue bin obserued with all seueritie and without fauour or exception. Yet during the last moneth of the siege that want and miserie within the towne were so ex∣treme, the cries so fearefull of such numbers as day∣ly dyed in the stréetes for hunger, & of so many others,
whose rage was such that openly they eate the dogs raw: the houlings of the people, the lamentations of such mothers as missed their children, did pearce not onely the aire but the stone wals, so as his ma∣iestie could not abide to heare them with such beast∣ly obstinacie, as they that were the causers did sée them with their eyes: yea those that had yet some prouision of victuals accounted all this people but vnprofitable soules, and thought long to haue them all dead and cast away, so that as the kings courage and magnanimitie are inuincible, so were his hu∣manitie and clemencie easie to be ouercome and did soone stoope to these monstrous pities, choosing rather to erre in the rules of warre than of nature, euen of his owne nature which aboundeth in mildnesse and clemencie. He considered that all this people were Christians, that they were his subiectes, that the most part were peraduenture innocent, & that there∣fore it was requisite to release them from this dis∣paire wherein they were lost, and in the end his good nature brake all barres of the lawes of warre. First he granted a Passeport for all the women, maidens, and children, and for all the Schollers that were willing to come forth: afterward he extended it to religious persons and Church men: And finally he enlarged it to those that had bene his greatest eni∣mies, yea he tooke care that at their comming forth they might be curteously receiued throughout all his Townes, whither they list to repaire. He suffered the Princes and Princesses that were in the Towne to be relieued with some proportion of victuals, which since hath bene but badly considered: so that it may be confessed that the siege continued longer by one moneth than it should, and so consequently had not the due effect: howbeit, sith this is the cause, it is so
holy and agréeable vnto God, that certainly it shall be rewarded double, and will be worth the recouerie not onely of Paris, but of the whole estate or more, so infinite are Gods graces and heauenly rewards. Moreouer his maiestie in all these extremities ne∣uer failed in al fatherly dueties that might be, exhor∣ting them by publike letters and messengers to re∣ceiue him, with assurance of all things concerning Catholike Religion, & whatsoeuer other good vsage & quiet peace. He permitted the Cardinall of Gondy and the Archbishop of Lions to haue recourse from them vnto him, who departed again so well satisfied and contented, that they wept to consider how ma∣ny did erre in an opinion that they had conceiued of his maiestie, farre other then they ought to haue: He also gaue them leaue to passe to the Duke of Maine, yet did all these his curtesies turne to poison and ve∣nim in their corrupted stomakes: whereof appeared a most certaine, but shamefull proofe, in that when the said Duke of Mayne returned the said Cardinall of Gondy and the Archbishop of Lions vnto his ma∣iestie, with protestation that he desired nothing so much as peace. He wrote likewise at ye same time to ye Parisians by one of his Secretaries that followed their traine, that they should not be dismayd for this Parley, and that he would rather dye then conclude any peace: which letter falling from him that car∣ried it, and being shewed to the said Duke of Mayne, he could not denie the signing thereof: which when the Archbishop of Lions obiected vnto him, he had no other excuse but that he was surprised: yet might he more truely haue said that thereby he purposed to haue surprised as well the one as the other. If his maiestie hath bene somewhat tender, and not altogither so strict as the lawes of war do com∣mand
in such rigor as was to be practised against the Parisians, he hath sufficiently recompenced the same in his care and diligence to méete with his enimies in the fielde, which hath alwayes bene his greatest desire, rather then with the Cannon to beat his townes and the poore inhabitants of the same. Immediatly after the beginning of the siege the King being aduertised that the Duke of Mayne, at his returne out of Flanders, whither he went to craue succour of the Duke of Parma, hauing alreadie gathered some troopes, was departed with Balagny & S. Paul to march and approch toward Paris, went from his armie with a troope of Horsemen without any baggage, and marched seuentéene leagues with∣out a baite to méete with him, and came short but one houre, hauing forced him to shut vp himselfe in the towne of Laon. After that the Duke of Maine hauing gathe∣red great succour and being come to Meaux, still gi∣uing out that he came to giue battaile, his said maie∣stie departed againe from his armie with a troupe of horse, and came to méet him almost to Meaux, where he found him enclosed betwéene the riuer of Marne, and that which commeth from Grecy, as fearing ra∣ther to be besieged, than indeuoring to besiege others, & this he did expecting the comming of the Duke of Parma, at whose arriuall and the daie following, they published euery where that they wold giue bat∣tel, whereat his maiestie reioyced more than at anie other thing. And in deede the Duke of Parma beeing come and ioyned with the said Duke of Maine, they began within two daies after to march, and passed the brooke that runneth by the towne of Claye, and the Castle of Fresne where they lodged, so that his maie∣stie hoping the next daie to haue battaile, hauing
commended himselfe to God (as in all such occasi∣ons he there beginneth) and exhorted euerie one to do the like, he departed from the Village of Challiot neere to Paris vpon Wednesday the nine and twen∣tith of the last moneth, and appointed the generall méeting of his whole army the next day in the plaine of Bondy, which lieth vpon the head of the forest of Eurie which was the direct way for the enimie, and to the end also to be ready to méete them if they tooke the way on the side whereby to shunne the passage thorough the said forest: hauing also the same day brought his footemen that lay in the suburbes of Pa∣ris to be at the battaile, the armie all the while stood vpon the said plaine of Bondie in battaile array, but had no newes of the enimie. Thither did his ma∣iestie cause his power to come and stay two dayes, where there appeared no enimy in any corner. Here∣vpon he resolued vpon Friday to draw nearer to them and to lodge at Chelles, to which end hauing sent the Lord of Lauerdin one of the marshals of his campe, and the Lord of Chastillion: at their arriuall they found the enimies marshals and harbingers that had begunne to prouide the lodgings, whom they droue away: and his maiestie comming soone after, descried some seuen or eight hundred of the enimies Horse, among whom the two Generals were said to be, whom he charged with a farre lesse number, and followed beating of them euen to their lodgings. Vpon Saturday the first of this moneth, his highnes stood assured of battaile aboue the said village of Chelles, which was a plaine that hath be∣hinde it two small hilles, at the head deuided from a smal wood with a brooke, and in the said wood is a Castle called Brou, and beyond it a moore separate from a little plaine that lieth betwéene the said castle
and the moore, with an other small brooke, which was the lodging that the enimie had taken. His ma∣iesties armie stoode in battaile aray: About eleuen of the clocke the Duke of Parma got vnto one of the hilles, to the end to view it, and hauing séene it, it is said he fetched as great a sigh as if it should haue bene his last: and turning to the Duked of Mayne, did greatly reproch him, saying, that this was not the armie of tenne thousand men, that he had assu∣red him to fight withall, but that he there descried aboue fiue and twentie thousand, the best in order that euer he had séene. This astonishment is not to bo obiected vnto him as a fault: for here had bene matter to haue daunted one that had both séene and lead greater armies than he, as indéed it may be truely said to haue bene the brauest armie that had bene séene in France a long time. It contained at the least eightéene thousand footemen, whereof sixe thousand were strangers, and fiue or sixe thousand Horses, of whom almost foure thousand were french Gentlemen, and of the best houses in France. Ther∣in were sixe Princes, two Mashals of France, and more Captaines and leaders of armies then are in all the rest of Christendome. The Prince of Parma in liew of comming to battaile, changed all his mens weapons, and for speares furnished them with Mattockes and Shouels, wherewith all the night they entrenched themselues within the moore, wherein both the Horsemen and footmen were lodged. The said Saterday after dinner his maiestie draue them from the brooke, the wood and the house that stood in the wood, so that they retired into the said moore, and from thence forth the duke of Parma in liew of battaile, sought onely to intrench & fortifie
himselfe, which he did verie strongly. At night his maiestie returned to lodge at the saide village of Chelles. Euerie daie after he laboured by al meanes to drawe them to the battell, causing continual skir∣mishes, wherein still some of their men stayed be∣hinde, all which notwithstanding there was no meanes to prouoke them anie farther, openly con∣fessing that vppon the saturdaie at afternoone they lost all stomacke to battell. Within a few dayes after they determined to assaile the little towne of Laigny that was within halfe a league behind them, & hauing made a bridge of Boates almost hard by the towne, vpon the eight day by breake of day, they passed ouer the most part of their footemen, beating it from ouer the riuer with nine péeces, the breach was made before his highnesse had in manner anie notice thereof, by reason the winde was so turned, and the mist so great and thick that the Canon could not be heard. There was in it some two or thrée hundred men, who defended it so well, that the eni∣my lost the greater number, and had the succour that was sent come neuer so little sooner, they had not so easily carried it awaie. It appeared well that there was neuer a village in France better able to defend it selfe, considering that they neuer forced it vpon any other considerati∣on, but caused it to be dismantelled so soone as they had taken it. His maiesty imagining that this might haue chéered vp their courage, commanded the skir∣mish the next day hotter then before, wherewith they were the lesse prouoked. Finally, considering that the most part of this gentrie, who at the onely report of this battaile were come in without any furniture, knowing themselues out of hope thereof, did vrge their departure. He thought it time to think
vpon some other kind of warre against the enimie, then to linger vpon drawing them to a generall fight, whereof they had sufficiently shewed them∣selues vnwilling to tast: yet before he would enter into this determination he purposed to trie one meanes more to draw them thereto. Wherefore he determined to make shew as if he would force Paris, and to the same end departed the tenth day at night from Chelles with a good troope of footemen and some gentrie, so to get by the breake of day to the gates of Paris and to offer the assault, hauing with all giuen commandement that the armie should the next morning depart and returne to Bondy: And this he did with this intent, that the enimie knowing of his returne to Paris should follow his armie, which might be an occasion of battaile: But the enterprise of Paris being discouered had no successe, as also had not the other: for all this notwithstanding, the eni∣mie durst not come forth of his moore, as standing in continuall feare of some false baite whereby to draw them where they were not resolued to come: which by this occasion rather then any other, was fully confirmed, because that seing his maiesties for∣ces separate they stirred not, as also that now there was no hope of any other than such as leasure might afford. This was the cause why his maiestie being retur∣ned to his armie at the said place of Bondy, where al the day it had waited for the enimies approch, and hearing no newes of their dislodging, determined the same day to take vp his lodging at Gonesse. The next morning hauing assembled the Princes, the of∣ficers of the crowne, and other great Captaines pre∣sent in the said armie, it was among them thorough∣ly discoursed and debated, that it was euident and
plaine that the Prince of Parmas intent was not for to fight: that to hope to force him therto in time by lodging still neere vnto him, he should haue the aduantage of them, his armie beeing fresh and vn∣der paie, consisting of strangers, who doe not light∣ly scatter, where contrariwise his maiesties for∣ces were for the most part tired, expecting no paie: That to returne to the siege of Paris, sith his ma∣iestie was not minded to take it perforce, but ra∣ther to exspect their last extremitie, the time wold be ouer long, the rather because they hauing had li∣bertie toward the parties of Beausse, euer since the departure of the army toward Chelles, might haue sufficiently refurnished themselues for the time. That sith the enemie would not warre after our manner, it was meete we should applie our selues to his: and sith hee woulde not haue the honour to fight with so many honorable personages, as to that end were assembled, it was requisite to fight and distresse him with the want of victualles and other such discommodities. That his maiestie furnishing his townes that lie vpon the riuer of Seine with victualls and strong garrisons, shoulde still keepe Paris as straightly besieged, as with the presence of an armie, & therefore that he should not neede so strong a one therabout as his was. That it might suffice to haue a meane power wherwith so ofte as the enemie should attempt any thing, still be at his héeles. That returning his forces into their Pro∣uinces from whence they came, woulde be a greate reliefe to the sayd prouinces, and by refreshing his sayd troupes, he should stil yeld them opportunitie to get somewhat. That when the forrein forces shal chance to enter, vpon the returne of his troups thus refreshed, and their ioyning with him, his ma∣iestie shall finde himselfe twice as stronge as hee
now is, and withall, shall so bridel the enemies, as they may not performe any great exploite: be∣sides that, the others comming vppon them, it will be a meanes to force them farther then to entrench in the moore. This opinion, with sundrie good and sufficient reasons being best liked, his maiestie in this famous councell concluded and decréed to fol∣lowe the sayd proposition, purposing to begin with the towne of Saint Denis, for the defence where∣of they stroue who should get the charge, euerie one hoping that therein rested some honour to be pur∣chased. In the end it fel to the Lord of Lauerdin, who thākfully accepted it. He prouided also strong garrisons to fortifie the townes of Melune, Cor∣beile, Senlis, Meulan, Maunt, and sundrie others, of which the least might suffice to bring the sayde Duke of Parmas power on their knées. His maie∣stie also resolued to returne into Touraine, An∣iou and Maine, the Lorde Prince of Contie, into Normandie the Duke of Montpenfier, into Picar∣dy the D. of Longueuil, into Champaigne the D. of Neuers, & into Burgondie the Marshall Aumont, euerie of them with good forces sufficient to keepe the said prouinces in peace. He also retained still about himselfe a meane power, yet strong and mighty enough to make head against the enemie, and to keepe him from anie en∣terprise, before he would be at their elbowes: withall purposing to holde them so short, that in a small time he might still be with them as occasion might require. This forme of warre did he iudge, (considering that ye enemies resolution tended not to fight) to bee more to their discommoditie and hinderance than anie other. Whereupon as the Lordes of Guich, Ragnie, & Ciper were vpon their
retreat, not hauing aboue sixe score fighting men, they met with the Vicount Tauannes retiring into Normandie with about fiue hundred Horse, where∣of aboue halfe were Cuirasses and the rest Harcubu∣ziers, whom in the end they charged and ouerthrew néere to Meulay, leauing of them aboue fiftie deade in the place, and taking as many prisoners togither with all their baggage. This is the true Historie of all that hath passed in his maiesties armie since the Duke of Parma ioyned with his enimies. Also the principall reasons that moued him to resolue vpon the dissoluing of his for∣ces, whereof he wisheth by these remembrances all his Gouernors and Lieutenants general of his pro∣uinces, his courtes of parliament, his Nobilitie, his townes and all other his officers to be informed, that they may certifie all other his good and faithfull subiects, to the end they may know that this resolu∣tion was not sleightly taken, neither by force nor compulsion, but vpon ripe deliberation and milita∣rie discretion, with the aduice and consent of the greatest and wisest Captaines at this daie in Eu∣rope, who still are assistant vnto the King, also that of the said resolution there is no other to be expected but all good successe: that God himselfe hath ear∣nestly dealt in the matter, alwaies shewing that he hath taken this so iust a cause into his protection, as not permitting so many Princes, so many great Lords and wise Captaines, euen sufficient to pur∣chase to this crowne thrée or foure others, to hazarde themselues in battell against those strangers, who all for the most part are mercinarie men, so as their whole losse is not to counteruaile the least of a hundred Princes and Lordes which might haue bene cast awaie.
It doth also euidently appeare, that he déemeth them vnworthie to be fought withall in such man∣ner, and is determined to bring them to destruction with lesse honour, and to ouerthrowe and defeate them by two inward enemies whome they haue a∣mong them, namely, want of victualles, which doth alreadie pinch them extremely, and diuision, which likewise is growen so great, that the French not a∣ble anie longer to beare the Spaniards insolencie, are for the most part retired: & there is no more in this armie of strangers, but the duke of Maine and some smal number of French men, whom they lead about as it were in triumph. For others haue they not yet gotten, as not hauing offered one sole com∣bat, and in such as haue bene presented them, still going awaie with losse. They haue not as yet reco∣uered the Ancients which they lost at Eurie, neither anie other wherewith to get them againe by ex∣change. The Parisians cannot boast their frantike obstinacie to be constancie, but are rather to confes that it is Gods sufferance, to the end to driue them to a longer penance, as also to be themselues the execucioners of the first punishments that he hath decréed against them: and for the second, hauing this comfort and recompence for their pacience and great seruice done to the Duke of Maine, viz. to sée the Spaniards whom he hath brought euen home vn∣to them, become masters of themselues and of their houses, their wiues and their daughters, wherein they may now he an example to others that should haue serued them in the preuention of the mischief that both doth and still wil oppresse them, vntill it may please God to suffer his Maiestie to be their deliuerer. Now hath the Duke of Maine good cause to féele
and iudge that his treacle is worse then the poison, and that the remedie which himselfe hath sought, is farre more dangerous than the mischiefe that he went about to cure. Neither shal the king of Spaine be quite frustrate of the reward to him promised by this trouble which he vpholdeth and nourisheth in this realme, by cloking his ambition with the false pretence of religion, which he ought first to haue pra∣ctised at his owne home, by rooting out paganisme, which is so ordinarie and whereof he reapeth profite and reuenue, permitting in Granado, Andalouzia and Arragon, more villages without Christians, than he hath good Christians in his best townes. It is Gods will that he should liue, to the end in his old dayes to lay vpon him the deserued iudgement of such sacriledge as himselfe committeth, enfringinge the confederacies that he hath with this crowne, which are not written in paper or parchment onely, but also in ye memories of mē, as kisses & publik faith. The Duke of Parma who had so wisely foreséene the reason why they sought to make him vndertake the enterprise of England, hath failed in this, wherein he shall shortly know that he shall haue more time to repent, then meanes of remedie. Al the mischiefe that this hath wrought, is that it hath so much the longer delayed the effect of his maiesties good meanings, who could not by reason of such great and continual affaires as haue still followed him, hitherto put in effect the afore resolued conuocation of the chiefe of this realme, with whom déepely to haue considered of whatsoeuer may be necessarie to the wealth and peace therof, which he claimeth as his owne, the one being inseparable from the other: As also he could get no leasure to take counsaile, first with God and then with men, by whom he might haue bene assisted
and holpen to resolue vpon whatsoeuer his good and affectionate catholike subiects do desire at his hands. It is greatly to be hoped that by this Crisis God wil at this time cure the disease, and therefore it is al our parts with one minde to cal vpon him, and to intreat him to grant vs his grace, wherewith the helpe of men shal not faile. The nobilitie hath sufficiently in all occasions yt haue bin offered, giuen to vnder∣stand their good mindes to sacrifice their liues for ye deliuerie of their king and realme from this canker of rebellion. Also it must follow that France must abandon & giue ouer the french name and language, if at this time she frée not her selfe from so many pet∣tie tyrants as do now oppresse her, and are determi∣ned to rent and share her among them: his Maiestie protesteth before God, that he wil neuer leaue armes vntill this be performed, and is resolued therein to imploy the rest of his life, if necessitie so require, as also he adiureth all the Princes, officers of the crowne, courtes of Parliament and all other orders of this estate, neuer to rest themselues, but contrari∣wise earnestly to take courage against the storme, to the end they might guide this vessell to the hauen of health, where we sée our God stretching forth his arme vnto vs, assuring them that vpon the present ariuall therof, he wil imploy his whole & first leasure on the granting to his subiects whatsoeuer conten∣tation he may, and that God shal more particularly inspire him withall, from whom he craueth to him∣selfe and his poore people all peace and reliefe possi∣ble, wishing no longer life then during the same to haue meanes to purchase vnto them that benifite, which is the whole fruit and reward that he desireth for his labours. FINIS.
