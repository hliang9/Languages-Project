To the READER. IT is said of Solomon, so much commended for WISDOM, 1 Kings 4.29. &c. That God gave him wisdom and understand∣ing exceeding much, and largeness of heart, e∣ven as the sand that is on the Sea-Shore. And that his wisdom excelled the wisdom of the Children of the East-Country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. And, that he was wiser than all men &c. And, that his fame was in all Nations round about: Which admi∣rable wisdom of his seemed chiefly to con∣sist in his Proverbs; Who spake, as Vers. 32. three thousand Proverbs; compared with Eccl. 12.9. The Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out and set in order many Proverbs.
1. The nature of a Proverb. For the Nature of them in general. They are short wise Sentences, containing much in a little. The Hebrew word  similitudo, parabola, proverbium sententia: citè gravi∣ter que dicta & paucis concinnata. Bux. Lex. signifies (as Buxt.) an excellent Speech, Sentence, Parable, or Similitude, acutely and weightily spoke and com∣prized in few words. The Greek words,, Proverbium, Adagium, Ep. 222. Parabola, Joh. 10.6. . 1. Compara∣tio alegori∣ca & aenigmatica, Mat. 13.13. 2. Obscura sententia, Mat. 15.15. 3. Exemplar seu Typus, Heb. 9.9. 4. Adagium. Luk. 4.23. 5. Similitudo. Heb. 11.11. Pas. Lex. , vel , as Pasor renders them, import much the same, viz. short Sen∣tences, sometimes comparative∣ly delivered, called by Greek Writers, , Axioms, or worthy sayings; and by the La∣tins Adagia, Adagies, short Sen∣tences.
In the Scripture sometimes called, The sayings of the Antients, 1 Sam. 24.13. because delivered by the wise ancient Fa∣thers or Elders, and therefore Prov. 1.6. called, The words of the wise; and sometimes, The sayings of old, 2 Sam. 20.18. Psal. 78.2. because the approbation and consent of Ages went to make them the usuage of a Nation, being brought by Custom and Tradition to every mouth. 2. The Ʋse of a Proverb. Proverbs we find are variously laid down and used in Scripture, sometimes by way of Comparison or Similitude,1. Compa∣ratively. which doth greatly illustrate, as Prov. 26.9. As a Thorn goeth up into the haend of a Drunkard, so is a Parable in the mouth of Fools. And vers. 11. As a Dog returneth to his vomit; so a Fool retur∣neth to his folly. Ver. 14. As a Door turneth upon his Hinges, so doth the slothful man up∣on his Bed. Be wise as Serpents, and harmless as Doves, Mat. 10.16.
The diffe∣rence be∣twixt a Proverb and a Pa∣rable.And the only difference be∣twixt this sort of Proverbs and Parables is, That one is a large si∣militude, the other a short one. A Parable is a long Proverb, and a Proverb a short Parable; being in Scrip∣ture therefore called both by one name, sometimes the Parable called Proverb, and the Proverb called Parable, Mat. 15.15. Our Saviour delighted so much in this kind of speaking, that he is said not to have spoke without them, Mat. 13.34. 2. Ob∣scurely.Sometimes in an obscure or aenigmatick way of speaking, and therefore called, Prov. 1.6. The words of the wise, and their dark sayings. And Psal. 87.2. Dark sayings of old; which our Saviour therefore usually explained, as not being understood many times by his Auditors, as John 10.6. Mat. 15.11,—15, 16, 17 ver. Mar. 13.11. And therefore it is said to him upon his explanation, John 16.26. Now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no Proverb, opposing plain speaking to proverbial or Paribolical.
Sometimes again in a plain fa∣miliar stile,3. Plainly. easie to be understood of all; containing short, pithy, sententi∣ous Doctrines, either for instruction, ex∣hortation, admonition or reproof: And of this kind are most of Solomon's, and indeed most we meet with in the Scriptures: as such as these: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom. Above all gettings, get understanding. Fools make a mock of sin. Man lives not by bread alone. Evil commu∣nication corrupts good manners. &c. 3. The End of a Proverb. The end of a Proverb is for information of the mind, and reformation of the man∣ners; and best exprest by Solomon himself, in his own words, Prov. 1.2, 3. To know Wisdom and Instruction; to perceive the words of Ʋnderstanding; to receive the In∣struction of Wisdom, Justice, Judgment and Equity. And this Universally to all sorts, degrees, age and sexes, young and old, poor and rich, learned and unlearned, foo∣lish and wise; therefore vers. 45. To give
subtility to the simple; to the young man, knowledg and discretion. To the wise and un∣derstanding, increase of learning, and the at∣taining to wise Counsels; to the understanding of a Proverb, or an eloquent Speech, (as the Margent) the words of the Wise, and their dark Sayings. It is said, the wisdom of the Ancient Grecians, that wise and un∣derstanding Nation, consisted much in their Proverbs; and to this day they are accounted the best evidence of the Wis∣dom of a Nation, whereof Collections are generally made, and Records usually kept. 4. The Order of Solomon's Proverbs. As for the Order of Solomon's Proverbs, they are without any methodical contex∣ture, or near dependance upon each other, which makes them the more abstruse, and difficult to the Reader; are therefore, for better help of Memory, brought into this method and order, being Alphabetically collected out of the Proverbs and Ecclesia∣stes; and though designed only for private use, is here tendred to the publick, as pro∣fitable
for all; but especially recommended to the wise improvement of Judicious School-masters, by whose ingenuity, these excellent Adagies, and worthy sayings, so full of Wisdom and knowledge, so expres∣ly leading to every duty, both to God, our selves and Neighbours, and of such Uni∣versal concern, may by Gods blessing be improved in School-learning, to instil such excellent Principles as may not only leave divine impressions upon the minds of their youth, but most admirably direct to every moral accomplishment, containing not on∣ly the true wisdom, (teaching the fear of the Lord) but all other necessary learning, as well Ethicks, viz. matters pertaining to moral vertues, as Prudence, Justice, Tem∣perance, &c. As Oeconomicks, viz. matters of Domestick or Family concerns, relating to the duties of husbands, wives, Parents, Children, Masters and Servants. And Po∣liticks also, relating to Government, and matters of State: so that Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, &c. and other Heathenish School-Authors, are not to be named with Solo∣mon,
who so instructs to every good word and work; the Proverbs indeed being what is said of the Scriptures, 2 Tim. 3.16. Profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor∣rection, for Instruction in Righteousness, &c. Therefore, as Solomon himself advises, Train up a Child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it, Prov. 22.6. If any advantage be reaped hereby to to you or yours, let God have the Glory, and the unworthy Instrument the benefit of your Prayers, who is desirous in every capacity faithfully to his utmost, To serve You and his Generation, whilst, H. D.
Of Wisdom. THE great Jehovah, who inhabits light, Appear'd to Solomon in a dream by night, And said, Ask now what I shall give to thee? Suppose now (Mortals) this same question be Propos'd to you, Let's hear, what would you say? And how would you dispose your choice, I pray? Give me (saith one) in Riches to abound: Give me (saith t'other) Honour and Renown. But what saith Solomon? O Lord impart To me a wise and understanding heart. Wise was thy choice, wise Solomon, to which God therefore added to be Great and Rich. The wisest Lord did know, that only he Could rightly use both Wealth and Dignity, Who steer'd his course by wisdoms sage advice; Here's the true Honour, here's the Pearl of price. For what's a Fool, that is with riches grac'd, A Swine, in whose fowl snowt a Gem is plac'd. Or what's a Fool, on whom honour doth wait? A long ear'd-Ass sitting in Chair of State. The Miser is a fool, and so is he That spends his wealth in prodigality: Whom, if they went to Wisdom, she would show A fair and middle path wherein to go.
And art thou great? be not a fool, for thus Thou'lt make thy folly more conspicuous. Acquaint they self with Wisdom, wait upon her, And she will add true glory to thine honour. By her Kings reign, and Princes do decree By her advice, Justice and Equity. A fool that is in honour doth but show Himself to be a fool in Folio. May n't Rehoboam justly stiled be, A famous fool, a fool in high degree? Whom Israels ten Tribes forsook because He wilfully forsook grave Wisdoms Laws; While be th' advice of Seniors refus'd, And the rash counsel of the Young Men us'd? Justly might Wisdom then preferred be By Solomon, 'bove wealth and dignity: With him she, above all, the Conquest won, Wisdom was justified by her Son: Into whose breasts she did a flame inspire, Which will last longer than the Vestal fire; A sacred flame it is, which ne're will die, But ev'n now burns for us to warm us by: A flame that gives not only heat but light, Not only warms the heart, but guides the sight. O Peerless Wisdom! teach us how to prize thee, That wealth nor honour may not equallize thee; Without thee they are worse than nothing; Thou Art without them both wealth and honour too. That we may know thy worth, let's search and see, From whence thou dost derive thy Pedegree.
Though equal honour be not to thee given, Yet thou'rt the off-spring of the King of Heaven, Wisdom doth shine in all his works, which he Grants man sometimes through Wisdoms glass to see. View now and read, Natures great Volumn, look Wisdom's in every leaf of Natures Book. Behold how she hath knit the whole Creation In a most glorious link to admiration. They're happy who with Contemplations eye The hidden secrets of her glory spie. O foolish man, that didst not know her price, But didst forsake her, and so Paradise: Whose mind the mists of Ignorance now cloud, While she in Heaven doth her glory shroud. Yet God (whom goodness doth delight) hath given A Palace to her here beneath the Heaven; That man (who did despise her glory) might In darkness see his folly by her light; A light, O blessed light, that shews the way, From which blind man hath so long gone astray, But where doth Wisdoms Palace stand, yo For this therefore, listen a while (I pray) T' a Pilgrim, who hath wandered about, And sought to find this famous Palace out. I went not far, when lo! I did espie, Far off, a Fabrick, beauteous to my eye, In a fair Prospect: I approacht therefore, And saw men crown'd with Lawrel at the door; They call'd them Poets: who, when as they knew I sought for Wisdoms Palace, all the crew
Cry'd out, Pray enter, and it will appear, That Wisdom (whom you seek for) dwelleth here. I entred then, and saw at my ingress, Rooms garnish'd to the life, I must confess; What Carvers art, or Painters skill could doe, Was represented there unto my view. But where's the Room where Wisdom doth abide, Wherein she doth her beams of glory hide? She's in that Room, (said they) so in I came; Loe t'was a Strumpet there, Fancy by Name, Whose whole Attire was very gay and spruce, Yet very wanton, and her gestures loose; Yet these same foolish Poets fell before her, And, as a Goddess, did they all adore her. Farewel (said I) for yet it don't appear, That Wisdom (whom I seek for) dwelleth here. Soon I went my journey, till my hast, Had brought me to a certain place at last, In which I saw men arguing together, Who aked me, What 'twas that brought me thither? To  for Wisdom, I reply'd: but they (Men called them Philosophers) did say, Enter this Palace, and it will appear, That Wisdom (whom you seek for) dwelleth here. I entered in, the Rooms did shine with Gold, And were all very glorious to behold: But yet although 'twas Gold unto my view, I fear the Gold was counterfeit, not true. And here and there were plac'd in divers stations, Both grave advices, and fine speculations,
I could not see distinctly; for my sight Was only guided by the Candle light Of nature— But where's Wisdom? O repair (Replyed they) to that Chamber, for she's there. Yea, this is she, said I; but coming nigh, I could no signs of life or motion spie; But saw she was an Image made by Art, Assimilating Wisdom in each part. O then, thought I, true Wisdom life hath got, And is from God above, but this is not. Farewell (said I) for yet it don't appear, That Wisdom (whom I seek for) dwelleth here. So I departed thence with speedy feet, Whenas I found that was not Wisdoms Seat. And in my progress, I at last did see, Some persons wearing Wisdoms Livery. Grace in their hearts: Then I enquiry made Where Wisdoms Palace was: they straight way said, "Enter these Scriptures, and it will appear, "That Wisdom (whom you seek for) dwelleth here. "Whose glory ('tis so great) tongue can't express, "When you have entred, you will say no less "She's glorious within, enlightned eyes "Do see such beauties which they can't but prize "She hath one Room all hung with Pearls (you'l see) "King Solmons Proverbs full of dignity. "She teaches how to manage every state "In which you fall; she'l teach to moderate "Prosperity; she'l make affliction bright; "She is a cloud by day, and flame by night
"She'l shew you secret joys, true comforts, and "E'relasting pleasures, ev'n at Gods right hand. Oh! now I have found her Palace, let me wait, Till Wisdom shall be pleas'd to ope her Gate. S. P. Of a Proverb. Who searches oft in smal things, worth descries A pearl is small, and yet of a great price: A Proverb is a Pearl then, rich, though small, But Scriptural most precious is of all. King Solomon hath left Posterity, A rich and everlasting Legacy; A Cabinet of Pearls, which all may take, Nor shall they yet their fellows poorer make: You may perhaps be owner of't, and yet I also may enjoy the Cabinet. Who will not then this Cab'net prize and keep? They'r precious Pearls, although they'r in a heap. You'l say, perhaps, they'r mixt together;—Well, Loe here, each Iewel hath it's proper Cell, And as your use requires, you may repair To such a Cell, and have a Jewel there. S. P.

There are a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness, 30.12. 14. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eye-lids look streight before thee, 4.25. Face. 1. A mans wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed; Eccl. 8.1. Father. 1. Hearken to thy Father that begat thee; and despise not thy Mother when she is old, 23.22.
2. Hear ye Children the instruction of a Fa∣ther, and attend to know understanding, 4.1. 3. A wise Son maketh a glad Father; but a foolish Son is the heaviness of his Mother, 10.1. 4. He that begetteth a fool, doth it to his sor∣row, and the Father of a Fool hath no joy, 17.21. 5. A wise Son heareth his Fathers instruction, when a foolish Son despiseth it: but he that regar∣deth reproof, is prudent, 13.1.—15.5. 6. A foolish Son is a grief to his Father; and bitterness to her that bare him, 17.25. 7. He that wasteth his Father, and chaseth a∣way his Mother, is a Son that causeth sname, and bringeth reproach, 19.26. 8. A foolish Son is the calamity of his Father 19.13. 9. Whoso curseth his Father, or his Mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness, 20.20 10. Whoso robbeth his Father or his Mother and saith, it is no transgression; the same is a com∣panion of a destroyer, 28.24. Fear. 1. The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortned, 10.27. 2. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death, 14.7. 3. The fear of the Lord is the instruction o wisdom; and before honour is humility, 15.33.
4. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth do I hate, 8.13. 5. In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence, & his children shall have a place of refuge, 14.26. 6. By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; and by the fear of the Lord men part from evil, 16.6. 7. Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therewith, 15.16. 8. The fear of the Lord tendeth to life, and he that hath it shall abide satisfied, he shall not be visited with evil, 19.23. 9. By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honour and life, 22.4. 10. To fear God and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man, Eccl. 12.13. 11. Though the sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know, it shall go well with them that fear God, which fear before him, Eccl. 8.12. 12. Fear thou the Lord and the King, and me∣dle not with them that are given to change, 24.21. 13. Happy is he that feareth always; but he that hardneth his heart, shall fall into mischief, 28.14. 14. The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord, he shall be safe, 29.25,
Feast. 1. A Feast is made for laughter, and Wine ma∣keth merry, Eccl. 10.19. Fire. 1. Can a man take Fire in his bosom, and his cloaths not be burnt, 6.27. Friend. 1. He that blesseth his Friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be ac∣counted a curse to him, 27.14. Fool. 1. A Fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover it self. 18.2. 2. Fools make a mock of Sin; but amongst the righteous there is favour, 14.9. 3. A Fools lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes, 18.6. 4. A Fools wrath is soon known, but a pru∣dent man covereth shame, 12.16. 5. Even a Fool when he holdeth his Peace, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his lips, is e∣steemed a man of understanding, 17.28. 6. It is a sport to a Fool to do mischief; but a man of understanding hath wisdom, 10.23. 7. Excellent lips become not a Fool; much less do lying lips a Prince, 17.7.
8. It is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be medling, 20.3. 9. Every prudent man dealeth with know∣ledge, but a fool layeth open his folly, 13.16. 10. Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a Morte amongst Wheat with a Pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him, 27.22. 11. A reproof entereth more into a wise man, than a hundred stripes into a fool, 17.10. 12. Wherefore is there a Price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? 17.16. 13. Wisdom is before him that hath under∣standing; but the eyes of a Fool are in the ends of the earth, 17.24. 14 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride, but the lips of the wise shall preserve them, 14 3. 15. A wise mans heart is at his right hand; but a Fools heart is at his left, Eccl. 10.2. 16. Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; but that which is in the midst of Fools is made known, 14.33. 17. Speak not in the ears of a Fool, for he will despise the wisdom of thy words, 23.9. 18. Seest thou a man wise in his own con∣ceit? there is more hope of a Fool than of him, 26.12 19. The Crown of the wise is their riches; but the foolishness of Fools is folly, 14.24.
20. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth, Eccl. 7.4 21. The legs of a lame man are not equal, so is a parable in the mouth of Fools, 26.7. 22. As a thorn goes up in the hand of a drun∣kard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools, 26.9. 23. As a Dog returneth to his vomit, so a Fool to his Folly, 26.11. 2 Pet. 2.22. 24. A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fools wrath is heavier than them both. 27.3. 25. Let a Bear robbed of her Whelps meet a man, rather than a Fool in his folly, 17.12. 26. The words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools Eccl. 9.17. 27. Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low places, Eccl. 10.6. 28. As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a Fool, 26.8. 29. A Whip for the Horse, a Bridle for the Ass and a Rod for the Fools back, 26.3. 30. He that troubleth his own house, shall in∣herit the Wind, and the Fool shall be Servant to the wise in heart, 11.29. 31. Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledg, 14.7. 32. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to hear the Song of Fools, Eccl. 7.5.
33. He that walketh with wise men, shall be wise; but a companion of Fools shall be destroy∣ed, 13.20. 34. He that sendeth a message by the hand of a ool, cuts off the feet, and drinks dammage, 26.6. 35. Dead flies cause the Oyntment of the A∣pothecary to send forth a stinking savour, so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour, Eccl. 10.1. 36. The folly of fools is deceit, 14.8. 37. The great God that formeth all things, both rewardeth the Fool, and rewardeth the transgressors, 26.10. Friend. 1. A man that hath Friends must shew him∣self friendly: there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a Brother, 18.24. 2. Iron sharpneth Iron; so a man sharpneth the countenance of his Friend, 27 17. 3. He that loves pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the King shall be his friend, 22.11. 4. Thine own Friend and thy Fathers Friend forsake not, 27.10. Froward. 1. A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth, 6.12. 2. He that hath a froward heart, findeth no good, 17.20.
3 A froward man soweth strife, and a whispe∣rer separateth chief friends, 16.28. 4. Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward; he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them, 22.5. 5. The froward is an abomination to the Lord; but his secret is with the righteous, 3.32. 6. The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom, but the froward tongue shall be cut out, 10.31. 7. Put away from thee the froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee, 4.24. Gift. 1. A mans Gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men, 18.16. 2. A Gift in secret pacifieth anger; and a re∣ward in the bosom strong wrath, 21.14. 3. A Gift is a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; whithersoever it turneth it prospe∣reth, 17.8. 4. A wicked man taketh a Gift out of his bosom to pervert the ways of judgment, 17.23. 5. He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth Gifts shall live, 15.27 6. Whoso boasteth of a false Gift, is like clouds and wind without rain, 25.14.
Goods. 1. When goods encrease, they are encreased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding them with their eyes? Eccl. 5.11. Grave. 1 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor de∣vice, nor wisdom, nor knowledge in the Grave whither thou goest, Eccl. 9.10. 2. There are three things that are never satis∣fied; yea four things say not, It is enough: The Grave, and the barren Womb, the earth that is not filled with water, and the Fire that saith not, It is enough, 30.15, 16. Han. 1. If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thy self; or if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, 30.32. 2. The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord as the Rivers of Water; he turnerh it whither∣soever he will, 21.1. Haste. 1. Seest thou a man hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him, 29.20. 2. He that is slow to wrath is of great under∣standing: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly, 14.19,
3. Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame, 25.8. 4 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for he is in Heaven and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy words be few, Eccl. 5.2. Hatred. 1. Hatred stirreth up strifes, but love covereth all sins, 10.12. 2. He that hideth hatred with lying lips; he that uttereth a slander, is a fool, 10.18. 3. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled Ox, and hatred therewith, 15.17. Head. 1. Let thy garments be always white, and let thy head want no oyntment, Eccl. 9.8. 2. The Glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head, 20.29. 3. The hoary head is a Crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness, 16.31. Heart. 1. My son give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe thy ways, 23.26. 2. A mans heart deviseth his way, but the Lord directeth his steps, 16.9.
3. A mans heart knoweth his own bitterness, and a stranger doth not intermedle with his joy, 14.10. 4. A merry heart maketh a cheerful counte∣nance, 15.13. 5. A merry heart doth good, like a medicine; but a broken spirit dryeth the bones, 17.22. 6. It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, & the living will lay it to heart, Ec. 7.2. 7. As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as Vinegar upon Nitre: so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart, 25.20. 8. The foolishness of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against the Lord, 19.3. 9. The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge; but the mouth of fools feed∣eth on foolishness, 15.14. 10. The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth, 10.20. 11. He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool; whoso walketh wisely, shall be delivered, 28.26. 12. The heaven for height, the earth for depth and the heart of Kings is unsearchable, 15.3. 13. The fining-pot for silver, and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tryeth the hearts, 17.3. 14. Hell and destruction are before the Lord, how much more the hearts of the children of men, 15.11.
15. As in water face answereth face, so the heart of man to man, 27.19. 16. Who can say, I have made my heart clean I am free from my sin? 20.9. Honey. 1. Hast thou found Honey? eat that which is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it, 25.16. Honour. 1. He that followeth after righteousness and mercy, findeth life, righteousness & honor, 21.21 2. A gracious woman retaineth honour, and strong men retain riches, 11.16. 3. A mans Pride shall bring him low; but h¦nour shall uphold the humble spirit, 29.23. 4. Whoso keepeth the fig-tree, shall eat th fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his Maste shall be honoured, 27.18. 5. In the multitude of people is the Kings ho¦nour; but in the want of people is the destru¦ction of the Prince, 14.28. 6. As Snow in summer, and rain in harvest so honour is not seemly for a fool, 26.1. Hope. 1. Hope deferred makes the heart sick, b when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life, 13.12
2. For to him that is joyned to all the living there is hope; for a living Dog is better than a dead Lyon, Eccl. 9.4. 3. The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish, 10.28. 4. When a wicked man dyeth, his expectati∣on shall perish, and the hope of the unjust man perisheth, 11.7. House. 1. The House of the wicked shall be over∣thrown, but the Tabernacle of the upright shall flourish, 14.11. 2. The Lord will destroy the House of the proud, but he will establish the border of the Widow, 15.25. 3. The wicked are overthrown, and are not but the House of the righteous shall stand, 12.7. 4. In the House of the righteous is much trea∣sure; but in the revenues of the wicked is trou∣ble, 15.6. 5. Through Wisdom is a House builded, and by understanding it is established, 24.3. 6. Withdraw thy foot from thy Neighbours House, lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee, 25.17.
Humble. 1. Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoyl with the proud, 16.19. 2. A mans pride shall bring him low, but ho∣nour shall uphold the humble in spirit, 29.23. 3. Do this now my son, & deliver thy self, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go humble thy self, and make sure thy friend, 6.3. 4. When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, there is lifting up, and he shall save the hum∣ble person, Job 22.29. Hunger. 1. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger, 19.15. 2. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfie his soul, when he is hungry, 6.30. 3. The full Soul loatheth a honey-comb: but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet, 27.7. Hypocrite. 1. An Hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered, 11.9. 2. The triumphing of the wicked is short, & the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment, Job 20.5. 3. What is the hope of a Hypocrite though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? Job 27.8,
4. That the Hypocrite reign not, lest the peo∣ple be insnared, Job 34.30. Increase. 1. Honour the Lord with thy substance, and the first fruits of all thine Increase, 3.9. 2. There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty, 11.24. Inheritance. 1. Wisdom is good with an Inheritance, and by it there is profit to them that see the Sun, Ec. 7.11. 2. A good man leaveth an Inheritance to his childrens children, and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just, 13.22. 3. An Inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning, but the end thereof shall not be bles∣sed; 20.21. Instruction. 1. Apply thy heart to Instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge, 23.12. 2 Hear Instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not, 8.33. 3. Whoso loveth Instruction, loveth know∣ledge, but he that hateth reproof is bruitish, 21.1 4. He is in the way of life that keepeth Instru∣ction; but he that refuseth reproof, erreth, 10.17.
5. The Commandment is a Lamp and the Law is light; and reproofs of Instruction are the ways of life; 6.23. 6 Give Instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a just man, and he will en∣crease in learning, 9.9. 7. He that refuseth Instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof, getteth understanding; 15.32. 8. Poverty and shame shall be to him that re∣fuseth Instruction, but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured, 13.18. 9. Take fast hold of Instruction, let her not go, keep her; for she is thy life, 4.13. 10. Cease my Son to hear the Instruction, that causeth to err from the words of knowledge, 19 27. Integrity. 1. The Integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perversness of transgressors shall destroy them, 11.3. 2. Better is the poor that walketh in his In∣tegrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, 19.1. Iudgment. 1. The King by Judgment establishes the land but he that receiveth gifts overthrows it, 29.4. 2. Many seek the Rulers favour: but every mans Judgment cometh of the Lord, 29.26.
3. Much Food is in the Tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judg∣ment, 13.23 4. Whoso keepeth the Commandment, shall feel no evil thing: and a wise mans heart discer∣neth both time and judgment, Eccl. 8.5. 5. Because to every purpose there is a time and judgment; therefore the misery of a man is great upon him, Eccl. 8.6. 6. The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them, because they refuse to do judgment, 21.7. 7. Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools, 19.29. Iust. 1. It is joy to the Just to do judgment, but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity, 21.15. 2. The just man walketh in his integrity; his children are blessed after him, 20.7. 3. The path of the Just is as a shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day, 4.18. 4. The memory of the Just is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot, 10.7. 5. The wicked is snared by the transgression of his Lips: but the Just shall come out of trouble, 12.13. 6. A Just man falleth seven times, and ri∣seth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief, 24.16.
7. He that justifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Just, even both are an abomi∣nation to the Lord, 17.15. 8. To punish the Just is not good, nor to strike Princes for equity, 17.26. King. 1. A divine sentence is in the lips of Kings, his mouth transgresseth not in judgment, 16.10 2. It is an abomination to Kings to commit wickedness, for the Throne is established by righteousness, 16.12. 3. Righteous lips are the delight of Kings, & they love him that speaketh right, 16 13. 4. A King that sitteth in the Throne of judg∣ment, scatters away all evil with his eyes, 20.8. 5. A wise King scattereth the Wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them, 20.26. 6. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the honour of a King to search out the mat∣ter, 25.2. 7. Where the Word of a King is, there is power; and who may say unto a King, What dost thou? Eccl. 8.4. Job. 34.18. 8. The wrath of a King is as Messengers of death, but a wise man will pacifie it, 16.14. 9. The Kings wrath is as the roaring of a Li∣on: but his favour is as dew upon the grass, 19.12.
10. In the light of the Kings countenance is Life, and his Favour is as the cloud of the latter Rain, 16.15. 11. The King that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for ever, 29.14 12. It is not for Kings to drink Wine, nor for Princes strong drink; lest they drink and forget the Law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted, 31.4, 5. 13. Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning, Ec. 10.16. 14. Take away the wicked from before the King, and his Throne shall be established in righteousness, 25.5. 15. Curse not the King, no not in thy thought, and curse not the rich in thy Bed-chamber; for a Bird of the Air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter, Ec. 10.20. Knowledge. 1. There is Gold, and a multitude of Ru∣bies, but the Lips of Knowledge are a precious Jewel, 20.15. 2. Receive my Instruction, and not Silver; and Knowledge rather than choice Gold, 8.10. 3. That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet, sinneth, 19.2.
4. He that hath Knowledge, spareth his words; and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit, 17.27. 5. Wisdom is a defence, and Money is a de∣fence; but the excellency of Knowledge is, that Wisdom giveth life to them that have it, Ec. 7.12. Labour. 1. In all Labour there is profit; but the talk of the lips tendeth to poverty, 14.23. 2. He that laboureth, laboureth for himself, for his mouth craveth it of him, 15.26. 3. All the Labour of man is for his mouth; yet the appetite is not filled. Eccl. 6 7. 4. Wealth gotten by vanity, shall be dimi∣nished; but he that gathereth by Labour, shall increase, 13.11. 5. All things are full of Labour, Man can∣not utter it, Eccl. 1.8. 6. There is a man whose Labour is in wis∣dom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein, shall he leave it for his portion, Eccl. 2.21. 7. There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his Soul enjoy good in his Labour, Eccl. 2.24.
8. Every man also to whom God hath given Riches, and Wealth, and given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to re∣joyce in his Labour; this is the gift of God, Eccl. 5.19. 9. What hath man of all his Labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath la∣boured under the Sun? Ec. 2.22. 10. As he ca forth of his Mothers Womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his Labour which he may carry away in his hand, Eccl. 5.15. 11. And this is also a sore evil; that in all points as he came, so shall he go, and what pro∣fit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? Eccl. 8.16. Land. 1. He that tilleth his Land shall have plenty of Bread; but he that followeth after vain per∣sons, is void of understanding, and shall have poverty enough, 28, 19. with 1.11. 2. Remove not the antient Land-mark which thy Fathers have set, 22.28. 3. For the transgression of a Land, many are the Princes thereof; but by a man of under∣standing and knowledge, the state thereof shall be prolonged, 28.2.
Laughter. 1. Even in Laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness, 14.13. 2. I said of Laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it? Eccl. 2.2. 3. Sorrow is better than Laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the Heart is made better, Eccl. 7.3. 4. A time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance, Eccl. 3.4. 5. As the cracklings of Thorns under a Pot, so is the Laughter of a fool, Eccl. 7.6. 6. A Feast is made for Laughter, and Wine maketh merry; but Money answereth all things, Eccl. 10.19. Law. 1. The Law of the Wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death, 13.14. 2. Where there is no vision, the people pe∣rish; but he that keepeth the Law, happy is he, 29, 18. 3. They that forsake the Law, praise the wicked; but such as keep the Law contend with them, 28.4. Liberal. 1. The Liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth, shall be watered also himself, 11.25.
Lips 1. The Lips of the righteous feed many; but fools dye for want of wisdom, 10.21. 2. The Lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; but the mouth of the wicked speak∣eth frowardness, 10.32. 3. The Lips of the wise disperse knowledge; but the heart of the foolish doth not so, 15.7. 4. In the Lips of him that hath understand∣ing, wisdom is found; but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding, 10.13. 5. The words of a wise mans mouth are Gracious; but the Lips of a fool will swallow up himself, Eccl. 10.12. 6. Burning Lips, and a wicked Heart, are like a potsheard covered with silver dross, 26.23. Lot. 1. The Lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord 16.33. 2. The Lot causeth contention to cease, and parteth between the mighty, 18.18. Lye. 1. A wicked doer giveth heed to false Lips; and a Lyer giveth ear to a naughty tongue, 17.4. 2. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflict∣ed by it, and a flattering mouth worketh ruine, 26.28.
3. A proud look and and a lying Tongue, the Lord hates, 6.17. 4. He that speaketh lyes, shall not escape. 19.5, 6. 5. The lying Tongue is but for a moment, 12.19. 6. Lying Lips are an abomination to the Lord; but they that deal truly, are his delight, 12.22. 7. A righteous man hateth lying; but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame, 13.5. 8. The getting of Treasures by a lying Tongue, is vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death; 21.6. 9. Remove far from me vanity and lyes, 30.8. Mercy. 1. Mercy, and Truth preserve the King, and his Throne is upholden in Mercy, 20.28. 2. The Merciful man doth good to his soul; but he that is cruel, troubleth his own flesh, 11.17. 3. He that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth; but he that hath Mercy on the poor, happy is he, 14.21. Messenger. 1. A wicked Messenger falleth into mischief, but a faithful Ambassador is health; 13.17.
2. As the cold of Snow in the time of Har∣vest, so is a faithful Messenger to them that send him; for he refresheth the soul of his Masters, 25.13. 3. An evil man seeketh only rebellion; there∣fore a cruel Messenger shall be sent against him, 17.11. Money. 1. Money answereth all things, Ecc. 10.19. Morrow. 1. Boast not thy self of to Morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth, 27.1. Mouth. 1. A man shall eat good by the fruit of his Mouth; but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence, chap. 13.2. 2. A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his Mouth; and the recompence of a mans hands shall be rendred to him, 12.14. 3. A mans Belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his Mouth; and with the increase of his Lips shall be filled, 18.20. 4. He that keepeth his Mouth, keepeth his Life; but he that openeth wide his Lips, shall have destruction, 13.3. 5. By the Blessing of the Upright the City is exalted; but 'tis overthrown by the Mouth of the wicked, 11.11.
6. The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood; but the Mouth of the upright shall deliver them, 12.6. 7. Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth; thou art taken by the words of thy mouth, 6.2. 8. A fools Mouth is his destruction, and his Lips are the snare of his Soul, 18.7. 9. Suffer not thy Mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, Eccl. 5.6. Name. 1. A good Name is rather to be chosen than great Riches; and loving Favour rather than Silver and Gold, 22.1. 2. A good Name is better than precious Oyntment; and the day of Death is better than the day of ones Birth, Eccl. 7.1. 3. The Name of the Lord is a strong Tow∣er; the Righteous runneth into it and is safe, 18.10. Naught. 1. It is naught, it is naught, saith the buy∣er; but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth, 20.14. Neighbour. 1. Better is a Neighbour that is near, than a Brother that is far off, 27.10. 2. He that is void of wisdom, despiseth his Neighbour, but a man of understanding holdeth his peace, 11.12.
3. Say not unto thy Neighbour, Go and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee, 3.28. 4. A man that flattereth with his Neighbour, spreadeth a Net for his feet, 29.5. 5. As a mad man who casteth Firebrands, Arrows, and Death; so is the man that de∣ceiveth his Neighbour, and saith, Am I not in sport? 26.18, 19. Net 1. In vain the Net is spread in the sight of any Bird, 1.17. News. 1. As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good News from a far Countrey, 25.25. Oppression. 1. He that oppresseth the poor, reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him, hath mercy on the poor, 14 31. 2. A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food, 28.3. 3. Oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart, Eccl. 7.7. 4. The Prince that wanteth understanding is also a great Oppressor but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days, 28.19.
5. I considered all the Oppressions that are done under the Sun; and behold the tears of such as were Oppressed, and they had no com∣forter; and on the side of the Oppressor there was power. Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive, Eccl. 4.1, 2. 6. If thou seest the Oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a Province, marvel not at the matter; for he that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than they, Eccl. 5.8. Ox. 1. Where no Oxen are, the Crib is clean; but much increase is by the strength of the Ox. 14.4. Past. 1. That which hath been, is now; and that which is to be, hath already been, and God re∣quireth that which is past, Eccl. 3.15. Pit. 1. Whoso diggeth a Pit shall fall therein; and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him, 26.27. 2. Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in evil ways, he shall fall himself into his own Pit; but the upright shall have good things in possession; 28.10.
3. He that diggeth a Pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh a Hedge, a Serpent shall bite him, Eccl. 10.8. Poor. 1. He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man; he that loveth Wine and Oyl shall not be rich, 21.17. 2. There is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty, 11.24. 3. He that followeth after vain persons, shall have poverty enough, 28.19. 4. Be not among Wine-bibbers, amongst ri∣otous eaters of flesh; for the Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall cloath a man with Rags, 23.20, 21. 5. Love not sleep lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread, 20.13. 6. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep; so shall thy po∣verty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man, 24.33, 34. 7. He that hasteneth to be rich, hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him, 28.22. 8. The ransom of a mans life are his riches; but the poor heareth not rebuke, 13.8.
9. There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing; there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches, 13.7. 10. The desire of a man is his kindness; and a poor man is better than a lyar, 19.22. 11. Better is the poor that walketh in his up∣rightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich, 28.6. 12. Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour: 19.4. 13. All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him. He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him, 19.7. 14. The poor is hated even of his neighbour, 14.20. 15. The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender, 22.7. 16. The poor useth intreaty; but the rich answereth roughly, 18.23. 17. There are a generation whose Teeth are as swords, their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from a∣mongst men. 30.14. 18. Rob not the poor because he is poor; nei∣ther oppress the afflicted in the gate, 22.22. 19. He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want, 22.16.
20. Whoso mocketh the poor, reproacheth his Maker; and he that is glad at calamities, shall not be unpunished, 17.5. 21. The rich and poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them both, 22.2. 22. He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth to the Lord; and that which he hath given, will he pay again, 19.17. 23. The righteous considereth the cause of the poor; but the wicked regardeth not to know it, 29.7. 24. He that hath a bountil eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his Bread to the poor, 22 9. 25. Whoso stoppeth his ear at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself and not be heard; 21.13. 26. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, plead the cause of the poor and needy, 31.9. Portion. 1. Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall come up∣on the earth, Eccl. 11.12. Praise. 1, As the Fining-pot for Silver, and the Fur∣nace for Gold, so is a man to his praise, 27.21. 2. Let another man praise thee, and not thy own mouth; a stranger, and not thy own lips, 27.2.
Pride. 1. Only by pride cometh correction, but with the well-advised is wisdom, 13.10. 2. When pride cometh, then cometh shame; but with the lowly is wisdom, 11.2. 3. An high look, a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked is sin. 21.4. 4. Every one that is proud in heart, is an abomination to the Lord: though hand joyn in hand, he shall not be unpunished, 16.5. 5. He that is of a proud heart, stirreth up strife; but he that putteth his trust in the Lord, shall be made fat, 28.25. 6. Better is the end of a thing than the be∣ginning thereof; and the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit, Eccl. 7.8. 7. Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath, 21.24. Prudent. 1. A Prudent man concealeth knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness, 12.23. 2. The wisdom of the Prudent is to under∣stand his way, 14.8. 3. The wise in heart shall be called Prudent; and the sweetness of the Lips increaseth Learn∣ing, 16.21. 4. A Prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on and are punish∣ed, 22.3.
5. The simple believeth every word, but the prudent looketh well to his going, 14.15. Prince. 1. Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to rule over a Prince, 19.10. 2. Many will intreat the favour of the Prince, and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts, 19.6. 3. By long forbearing is a Prince perswaded, 25.15. Proclaim. 1. Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness; but a faithful man, who can find? 20.6. Quiet. 1. Whoso hearkens to wisdom shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. 1.33. 2. Better is a dry morsel, and quietness there∣with, than a house full of sacrifices with strife, 17.1. 3. Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travel and vexation of spirit, Eccl. 4.6. Rebuke. 1. Open Rebuke is better than secret love, 27.5. 2. A scorner heareth not Rebuke, 13.1.
3. To them that rebuke the wicked shall be delight; and a good biessing shall come upon them, 24.25. 4. He that reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame; and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot, 9.7. 5. He that rebuketh a man, afterwards shall find more favour, than he that flattereth with with his tongue, 28.23. Recompence. 1. Say not I will recompence evil; but wait on the Lord and he shall save thee, 20.22. Reprover. 1. As an Ear-ring of Gold, and an ornament of fine Gold; so is a wise Reprover to an obedi∣ent Ear, 25.12. 2. The Rod and Reproof give wisdom, 29.15. 3. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, 6.23. 4. He that heareth Reproof, getteth under∣standing, 15.32. 5. The ear that heareth the reproof of life; abideth among the wise, 15.31. 6. Reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge, 19.25. 7. Reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee; rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee, 9.8. 8. He that refuseth reproof erreth, 10.17.
9. He that hateth reproof is brutish, and shall die, 12.1. & 15.10. 10. He that being often reproved hardneth his neck; shall suddainly be destroyed, and that without remedy, 29.1. Respect. 1. It is not good to have Respect of persons in judgment, 24 23. 2. To have Respect of persons, is not good: for, for a piece of bread that man will trans∣gress, 28.21. Rich. 1. Labour not to be rich; cease from thy own understanding, 23.4. 2. Riches profit not in the day of wrath; but righteousness delivereth from death, 11.4. 3. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for Riches certainly make themselves wings; they flee away as an Eagle towards Heaven, 23.5. 4. Riches are not for ever, and doth the Crown endure to every generation? 27.24. 5. The sleep of a labouring man is sweet; whether he eat little or much: but the abun∣dance of the Rich will not suffer him to sleep, Eccl. 5.12. 6. A faithful man shall abound with bles∣sings; but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent, 28.20.
7. He that trusteth in his Riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch, 11.28. 8. The Rich man's wealth is his strong Ci∣ty, and as an high wall in his own conceit. The destruction of the poor is their poverty, 18.11. & 10.15. 9. The Rich hath many friends, 14.20. 10. Give me neither Poverty nor Riches: feed me with food convenient for me, 30.8. 11. There is a sore evil that I have seen under the Sun, namely, Riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. But those Riches perish by evil travel; and he begetteth a Son, and there is nothing in his hand, Eccl. 5.13, 14. 12. A man to whom God had given Riches, Wealth and Honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth; yet God gi∣veth him not power to eat thereof, but a stran∣ger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil di∣sease, Ec. 6.2. 13. By knowledge shall the chambers be fil∣led with all precious and pleasant Riches, 24.4. Righteous. 1. The Righteous is more excellent than his neighbour; but the way of the wicked seduceth them, 12.26. 2. The mouth of a Righteous man is a Well of Life; but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked, 10.11.
3. The lips of the Righteous feed many, but fools dye for want of wisdom, 10.21. 4. The slothful covet all the day long, but the Righteous giveth and spareth not, 21.26. 5. When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoyce; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn, 29.2. 6. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; but the righteous doth sing and re∣joyce, 29.6. 7. When righteous men rejoyce, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, a man is hid∣den, 28.12. 8. When it goeth well with the righteous, the City rejoyceth; and when the wicked pe∣rish, there is shouting, 11.10. 9. A righteous man regardeth the life of his Beast; but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, 12.13. 10. He that speaketh truth, sheweth forth righteousness; but a false witness deceit, 12.17. 11. A righteous man wisely considereth the House of the wicked; but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness, 21.12. 12. The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a Lyon, 28.1. 13. The way of a slothful man is as a hedge of Thorns; but the way of the righteous is made plain, 15.19.
14. The fruit of the Righteous is a tree of life, and he that winneth Souls is wise, 11.30. 15. The labour of the Righteous tendeth to Life; the fruit of the wicked to sin, 10.16. 16. The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit, 12.12. 15. The fear of the wicked it shall come up∣on him, but the desire of the righteous shall be granted, 10.24. 18. The Lord is far from the wicked; but he heareth the prayer of the righteous, 15.29. 19. The Righteous is delivered out of trou∣ble, and the wicked cometh in his stead, 11.8. 20. The wicked shall be a ransom for the Righteous: and the transgressor for the upright, 21.18. 21. Behold the Righteous shall be recompen∣sed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner, 11.31. 22. When the wicked are multiplied, trans∣gression increaseth; but the righteous shall see their fall, 29.16. 23. Evil pursueth sinners; but to the righ∣teous, good shall be repayed, 13.21. 24. The righteous man eateth to the satisfy∣ing of his Soul; but the belly of the wicked shall want, 13.25.
25. The Lord will not suffer the righteous to famish; but he casteth away the substance of the wicked, 10.3. 26. As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wick∣ed no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation, 10.25. 27. The righteous shall never be removed; but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. 10.30. 28. A man shall not be establish'd by wick∣edness; but the rod of the righteous shall not be moved, 12.3. 29. The light of the righteous rejoyceth; but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out, 13.9. 30. The way of the wicked is an abomina∣tion to the Lord; but he loveth him that fol∣loweth after righteousness, 15.9. 31. Better is a little with righteousness, than great Revenues without right, 16.8. 32. Righteousness exalteth a Nation; but sin is a reproach to any people, 14.34. 33. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; but righteousness delivereth from death, 10.2. 34. The wicked worketh a deceitful work; but to him that soweth righteousness, shall be a sure reward, 11.18. 35. The righteousness of the perfect shall di∣rect his way; but the wicked will fall by his own wickedness, 11.5.
36. In the way of righteousness is life, and in the path-way thereof is no death, 12.28. 37. Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way; but wickedness overthroweth the sinner, 13.6. 38. As Righteousness tendeth to life; so he that pursueth evil, pursueth it to his own death, 11.19. 39. Lay not wait (O wicked man) against the dwelling place of the Righteous; spoil not his resting place, 24.15. 40. A Righteous man falling down before the wicked, is as a troubled Fountain, and a corrupt Spring, 25.26. 41. He that saith to the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, Nations shall abhor him, 24.24. 42. Be not Righteous overmuch, neither make thy self over-wise; why shouldest thou destroy thy self, Eccl? 7.16. 43. All things are alike to all; there is one e∣vent to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean, Eccl. 9.2. Rule. 1. He that ruleth over his own spirit, is bet∣ter than he that taketh a City, 16.32. 2. He that hath no rule over his own spirit, is like a City that is broken, and without Walls, 25.28.
3. There is a time when one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. Eccl. 8.9. 4. As a roaring Lion, and a ranging Bear; so is a wicked Ruler over the poor people, 28.15. 5. If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked, 29.12.. 6. If the spirit of the Ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences, Eccl. 10.4. 7. Be not desirous of the dainties of the Ru∣ler; for they are deceitful meats, 23.3. Sacrifice. 1. The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomi∣nation to the Lord; but the prayer of the up∣right is his delight, 15.8. 2. The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomi∣nation; how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 3. To do justice and judgment, is more ac∣ceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice, 21.3. Safety. 1. The Horse is prepared against Battel; but Safety is of the Lord 21.31. Scorn 1. A Scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not; but knowledge is easie to him that under∣standeth, 14.6.
2. A Scorner loveth not him that reproveth him, neither will he go unto the wise, 15.12. 3. Cast out the Scorner, and contention shall go out; yea strife and reproach shall cease, 22.10. 4. A Scornful man bringeth a City into a snare; but wise men turn away wrath, 29.8. 5. Smite a Scorner and the simple will beware, 19.25. 6. When the Scorner is punished, the sim∣ple is made wise; and when the wise is in∣structed he receiveth knowledge, 21.11. 7. The Lord Scorneth the Scorner, but giveth grace to the lowly, 3.34. 8. The Scorner is an abomination to men, 24.9. Season. 1. To every thing there is a Season; and to every purpose there is a time and judgment, Eccl. 3.1. & 8.6. Seed. 1. In the morning sow thy Seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not, &c. Eccl. 11.6. Silver. 1. He that loveth Silver shall not be satisfi∣ed with Silver; and he that loveth abundance, with increase, Eccl. 5.10.
Servant. 1. Accuse not a Servant unto his Master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty, 30.10. 2. A wise Servant shall have rule over a Son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the Brethren, 17.2. 3. The Kings favour is towards a wise Ser∣vant; but his wrath is against him that causeth ame, 14.25. 4. He that delicately bringeth up his Servant from a Child, shall have him become his Son at the length, 29.21. 5. When a Servant reigneth, the Earth is dis∣quieted, 30.21, 22. Slothful. 1. A Slothful man saith, there is a Lion in the street, I shall be slain in the street, 26.13. 2. A Slothful man hideth his hand in his bo∣som, and it grieveth him to bring it unto his mouth again, 26.15. 3. The Sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that can render a reason, 26.16. 4. As a door turneth up the hinges, so doth a Slothful man upon his Bed, 26.14. 5. The desire of the Slothful killeth him, for his hands refuseth labour, 21.25. 6. The way of the Slothful man is a hedge of Thorns, 15.19.
7. He that is slothful in his work, is brother to him that is a great waster, 18.9. 8. I went by the field of the slothful, and by the Vineyard of the man void of understanding: and lo it was all grown over with Thorns, and Nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone-wall thereof was broken down, 24, 30.31. 9 By much Slothfulness the Building decay∣eth, and through idlenss of the hands the house droppeth through, Eccl. 10.18. 10. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle Soul shall suffer hunger, 19.15. 11. The Sluggard will not plough by reason of cold; therefore shall he beg in Harvest, and have nothing, 20.4. 12. As Vinegar to the Teeth, and as Smoak to the Eyes; so is a Sluggard to them that send him, 10.26. Spirit. 1. The Spirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly, 20.27. 2. Who knoweth the Spirit of a man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beast that goeth downward to the Earth? Eccl. 3.21. 3. As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God that maketh all, Eccl. 11.5.
4. There is no man that hath power of the Spirit to retain the Spirit; neither hath he pow∣er in the day of death; and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver them that are given to it, Eccl. 8.8. 5. The Spirit of man will bear his infirmity; but a wounded Spirit who can bear? 18.14. 6. By sorrow of heart the Spirit is broken, 15.13. Stones. 1. Whoso removeth Stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood, shall be endangered thereby, Eccl. 10.9. Study. 1. Of making Books there is no end; and much study is a weariness to the flesh, Eccl. 12.12. Sun. 1. There is no new thing under the Sun, Eccl. 1.9. Strife. 1. The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out waters; therefore leave off conten∣tion before it be medled with, 17.14. 2. The churning of milk bringeth forth But∣ter, and the wringing of the Nose bringeth forth blood; so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife, 30.33.
3. He loveth transgression that loveth strife; and he that exalteth his gate, seeketh destru∣ction, 17.19. 4. Where no wood is, the fire goeth out; so where there is no tale-bearer, the strife ceaseth, 26.20. 5. A wrathful man stirreth up strife; but he that is slow to anger, appeaseth strife, 15.18. 6. He that passeth by and medleth with strife that belongeth not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears, 26.17. Surety. 1. Be not thou one of them that strike hands, nor of them that are Sureties for debts: If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take a∣way thy bed from under thee? 22.26, 27. 2. A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh Surety in the presence of his friend, 17.18. 3. Take his Garment that is Surety for a stran∣ger, and take a pledge of him for a strange Wo∣man, 23.16. 4. My Son, if thou be Surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy wouth, 6.1.2. 5. He that is Surety for a stranger, shall smart for it; and he that hateth Suretyship, is sure, 11.15.
Tale-bearer. 1. A Tale-bearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter, 11.13. 2. The words of a Tale-bearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly, 18.8. 3. He that goeth about as a Tale-bearer, re∣vealeth secrets; therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his Lips, 20.19. Thief 1. Whoso is partner with a Thief, hateth his own soul; he heareth cursing, and be∣wrayeth it not, 29.24. Thoughts. 1. The thoughts of foolishness is sin, 24.9. 2. The thoughts of the wicked are an abomi∣nation to the Lord; but the words of the pure are pleasant words. 15.26. 3. Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy Thoughts shall be established, 16.3. Tongue. 1. Death and Life are in the power of the Tongue; they that love it, shall eat the fruit thereof, 18.21. 2. Whoso keepeth his mouth and tongue, keepeth his Soul from trouble, 21.23.
3. A wholsom Tongue is a tree of life; but per∣verseness therein is a breach of the spirit, 15.4. 4. A soft Tongue breaketh the bone, 25.15. 5. A virtuous woman openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her Tongue is the law of kindness, 31.26. 6. There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword; but the Tongue of the wise is health, 12.18. 7. The North-wind driveth away rain; so doth an angry countenance a backbiting Tongue, 25.23. 8. He that hath a perverse Tongue falleth into mischief, 17.20. 9. The Tongue of the just is as choice silver, 10.20. 10. The Tongue of the wise useth know∣ledge aright; but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness, 15.2. Tree. 1. If the Tree fall towards the South, or to∣wards the North; in the place where the Tree falleth there it shall be, Eccl. 11.3. Truth. 1. My mouth shall speak Truth; and wicked∣ness is an abomination to my Lips, 8.7. 2. The lips of Truth shall be established for ever, 12.9.
3. Buy the Truth and sell it not: also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding, 23.23. Trust. 1. Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own understanding, 3.5. Vanity. 1. He that soweth iniquity, shall reap Va∣nity, and the rod of his anger shall fail, 22.8. Violence. 1. Evil men eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of Violence, 4.17. 2. A man that doth Violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the pit, let no man stay him, 28.17. 3. The soul of the transgressor shall eat Vio∣lence, 13.2. 4. A Violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good, 16.29. Vnderstanding. 1. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth Ʋnderstanding, 3.13. 2. Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom; and with all thy gettings, get Ʋnderstanding, 4.7. 3. How much is it better to get wisdom, than Gold? and to get Ʋnderstanding, rather to be chosen than silver? 16.16.
4. Ʋnderstanding is a Well of Life to them that have it, but the instruction of fools is fol∣ly, 16 22. 5. Good Ʋnderstanding giveth favour; but the way of the transgressor is hard, 13.15. 6. Discretion shall preserve thee, Ʋnder∣standing shall keep thee, 2.11. 7. He that getteth wisdom, loveth his own soul: he that keepeth Ʋnderstanding shall find good, 19.8. 8. The man that wandreth out of the way of Ʋnderstanding, shall remain in the congregation of the dead, 21.16. 9. Say unto Wisdom, thou art my Sister, and call Ʋnderstanding thy kinswoman, 7.4. 10. There is no wisdom, Ʋnderstanding, nor counsel against the Lord, 21.30. Vngodly. 1. An Ʋngodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire, 16.27. Vnjust. 1. He that by Usury and Ʋnjust gain increas∣eth his substance, he shall gather it for him that shall pity the poor, 28.8. 2. An Ʋnjust man is an abomination to the just, and he that is upright in his way, is an abomination to the wicked, 29.27.
Vpright. 1. God hath made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions, Eccl. 7.29. 2. They that are of a froward heart, are an abomination to the Lord; but such as are up∣right in their way, are his delight, 11.20. 3. The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; but he that keepeth his way preser∣veth his Soul, 16.17. 4. He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord; but he that is perverse in his way despiseth him, 14.2. 5. He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely; but he that perverteth his way, shall be known, 10.9. 6. The way of the Lord is strength to the upright; but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity, 10.29. 7. The Lord lays up sound wisdom for the righteous, he is a buckler to them that walk up∣rightly, 2.7. 1. A wicked man hardeneth his Face; but as for the upright he directeth his way, 21.29. 9. Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved; but he that is perverse in his ways, shall fall at once, 28.18.
Vow. 1. It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after Vows to make en∣quiry, 20.25. Water. 1. Stolen Waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant, 9.17. War. 1. There is a way that seemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death, 14.12. 2. The way of the wickd is darkness, they know not at what they stumble, 4.19. 3. The way of life, is above to the wise, that they may depart from Hell beneath, 15.24. 4. Hear thou my Son, and be wise, and guide thy heart in the way, 23.19. 5 Walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous, 2.20. 6. Mans goings are of the Lord, how can a man then understand his own way? 20.24. 7. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths, 3.6. 8. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy was be established, 4.26. 9. The Lord keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of the Saints, 2.8.
10. There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not; The way of an Eagle in the air; the way of a Serpent upon a Rock; the way of a Ship in the midst of the Sea; and the way of a Man with a Maid, 30.18, 19. Wander. 1. As a Bird that wandereth from her Nest, so is a Man that wandereth from his place, 27.8. Wealth. 1. Wealth gotten by vanity, shall be dimini∣shed; but he that gathereth by labour, shall in∣crease, 13.11. 2. Every man to whom God hath given riches, and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoyce in his labour; this is the gift of God, Eccl. 5.19. Water. 1. Drink water out of thine own Cistern, and running waters out of thine own Well, 5.15. 2. Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets; let them only be thy own, and not strangers with thee. 5.16, 17. 3. The words of a mans mouth are as deep waters, and the well-springs of Wisdom like a flowing Brook, 18.4.
4. Cast thy bread upon the Waters, for thou shalt find it after many days, Eccl. 11.1. Weight. 1. Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are like abomination to the Lord, 20.10. 2. Divers weights are an abomination to the Lord, and a false ballance is not good, 20.23. 3. A just weight and ballance are the Lords, and all the weights of the bag are his work, 16.11. 4. A false ballance is an abomination to the Lord; but a just weight is his delight, 11.1. Wicked. 1. Be not over-much wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou dye before thy time? Eccl. 7.17. 2. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men, 4.14. 3. When the wicked cometh, then cometh al∣so contempt, and with ignominy reproach, 18.3. 4. There shall no evil happen to the just, but the wicked shall be filled with mischief, 12.21. 5. The soul of the wicked desireth evil, his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes, 21.10. 6. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords  his sins, 5.22. 7. Fret not thy self because of evil men, nei∣ be thou envious at the wicked, 24.19.
8. I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the City when they had so done: this is also vanity, Eccl. 8.10. 9. The Lord hath made all things for him∣self, even the wicked for the day of evil, 16.4. 10. There shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out, 24.20. 11. A good man obtaineth favour of the Lord; but a man of wicked devices shall he condemn, 12.2. 12. Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh, 3.25. 13. The wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressor shal be rooted out of it, 2 22. Wife. 1. House and riches are the inheritance of fathers, but a prudent wife is from the Lord. 19.14. 2. Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord, 18.22. 3. Let thy fountain be blessed, rejoyce in the wife of thy youth, 5.18. 4. Live joyfully with thy wife whom thou lovest, all the days of the life of thy vanity, which God hath given thee under the Sun; for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the Sun, Eccl. 9.9.
5. A foolish Son is the calamity of his Father; and the contentions of a Wife are a continual dropping, 19.13. Wind. 1. What profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? Eccl. 5.16. 2. He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds, shall not reap, Eccl. 11.4. Wine. 1. Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosever is deceived thereby is not wise, 20.1. 2. Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babling? who hath wounds? who hath redness of, eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to seek mixt wine, 23.29, 30. 3. Look not thou upon the wine when it is Red, when it giveth its colour in the cup, when it moveth it self aright. At last it biteth like a Serpent; and stingeth like an Adder. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things, 23.31, 32, 33. 4. Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and Wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more, 31.6, 7.
Wise. 1. Bow down thine ears, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thy heart to wisdom, 22.17. 2. My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoyce, even mine, 23.15. 3. A wise man will hear, and increase learn∣ing; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels, 1.5. 4. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin; but he that refraineth his lips is wise, 10.19. 5. The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips, 16.23. 6. There is treasure to be desired, and oyl in the dwelling-place of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up, 21.20. 7. These things also belong to the wise; It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment, 24.23. 8. The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastned by the masters of Assemblies, which are given from one shepherd, Eccl. 12.11. 9. There be four things that be little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise, the Ants, the Conies, the Locusts, and the Spiders, 30.24. 10. Go to the Ant thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise, 6.6.
11. If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh there is no rest, 29.9. Wisdom. 1. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions, 8.12. 2. Wisdom is better than rubies; and all things that may be desired, are not to be com∣pared to it, 8.11. 3. Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good, Eccl. 9.18. 4. Wisdom is better than strength; never∣theless the poor mans wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard, Eccl. 9 16. 5. Wisdom strengtheneth the wise, more than ten mighty men who are in the City, Eccl. 7.19. 6. Wisdom is too high for a fool, he openeth not his mouth in the gate, 24.7. 7. He that handleth a matter wisely, shall find good; and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he, 16.20. 8. Through desire a man having separated himself, seeketh and intermedleth with all wis∣dom, 18.18. 9. Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this, Eccl. 7.10.
10. In much wisdom is much grief; and he that encreaseth knowledg, encreaseth sorrow, Ec 1.18 Witness 1. The Lord hates a false witness, that speak∣eth lies; 6.19. 2. A faithful witness will not lye; but a false witness will utter lies, 14.5. 3. A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that speaketh lies shall not escape, 19.5. 4. A false witness shall perish; but a man that heareth, speaketh constantly, 21.28. 5 A man that heareth false witness against his Neighbour, is a Maul, and a Sword, and a sharp Arrow, 25.18. 6. A true witness delivereth souls; but a de∣ceitful one speaketh lies, 14 25. 7. An ungodly witness scorneth judgment; and the mouth of the wicked devoureth ini∣quity, 19.28. 8. Be not witness against thy neighbour with∣out cause; and deceive not with thy lips, 24 28. Woman. 1. A foolish woman is clamorous and simple, and knoweth nothing, 9 13. 2. The lips of a strange woman drop as an ho∣ney comb; her mouth is smoother than oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged-sword; her feet go down to death, her steps take hold of hell, 5.3, 4, 5.
3. Wisdom will deliver thee from a strange woman, the stranger that flattereth with her words, which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead, 2.16, 17, 18. 4. Remove thy way far from the strange Woman, and come not near the door of her house; lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years to the cruel; lest strangers be fil∣led with thy wealth, and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and body are consumed; and say, how have I hated instruction, &c. 5.9, 10, 11, 12. 5. For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four it cannot bear; for a Servant when he reigneth, and a fool when he is filled with meat; for an odious Woman when she is Mar∣ried, and an hand-maid that is Heir to her Mi∣striss, 30.21, 22, 23. 6. I find more bitter than death, the Woman whose heat is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her, Eccl. 7.26. 7. The mouth of a strange Woman is a deep pit; he that is abhorred of the Lord, shall fall therein, 22.14. 8. Give not thy strength to Women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth Kings, 31.3.
9. Why wilt thou my Son be ravisht with a strange Woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? for the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his go∣ings, 5.20, 21. 10. Keep the Commandment, and it will keep thee from the evil Woman, from the flat∣tery of the tongue of a strange Woman: lust not after her Beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye-lids, 6.24.25. 11. As a jewel of Gold in a Swines snout; so is a fair woman without discretion, 11.22. 12. A virtuous Woman is a Crown to her Husband; but she that maketh ashamed, is as rottenness to his bones, 12.4. 13. Every wise Woman buildeth her House, but a foolish Woman pulleth it down with he hands, 14.1. 14. It is better to dwell in the corner of a House-top, than with a brawling Woman in a wide house, 25.24. 15. It is better to dwell in the Wilderness, than with a contentious and angry Woman, 21.19. 16. Who can find a virtuous Woman? for her price is above Rubies, 31.10. 17. One Man among a thousand have I found; but a Woman among all these have I not found, Eccl. 7.28.
18. Favour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain; but a Woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the Gate, 31.30, 31. 29. Whoso hideth the contentious Woman, hideth the Wind; and the ointment of his right Hand which bewrayeth it self, 27.16. Word. 1. Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop; but a good word maketh it glad, 12.25. 2. Pleasant words are as the Hony-comb, sweet to the Soul, and health to the Bones, 16.24. 3. A word fitly spoken, is like apples of Gold in pictures of Silver, 25.11. Wrath. 1. A man of great wrath shall suffer punish∣ment; for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again, 9.19. THE END.
