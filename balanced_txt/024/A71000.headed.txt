Severall LETTERS OF Great Importance, AND Good Successe. Lately obtained against the Fellowship of Bristow, by Captain William Smith, Captain of his Majesties Ship called the Swallow, now in service for the King and Parliament. And likewise the Lord Admiralls design upon Bristoll, and the Navy making ready there under the Command of Sir Iohn Pennington. LONDON, Printed for Lawrence Blaiklock, at the signe of the Sugar-loafe neare Temple Barre, 1643.
SIR, ACcording to my last unto you, I set saile on the third of August 1643. out of Kinsayle to ply to the Eastward, and between the Saul-tiers and the Smales, I made a Sayle some two leagues to the Eastward, on the fifth of the same moneth, in the Morning, and at Even fetch∣ing her up, she proved to be a vessell belonging to North Yarmouth, and come from Strangford in Ireland, laden with wood, and bound for Milford in Wales, to deliver there: And in∣quiring what newes, the Master told mee that hee met with Captaine Iordan, in the Expedition, who had taken a Hamburger, burthen about three hundred Tuns, of force, sixteene Gunnes, being laden with Salt and other provisions, she came from Rochell in France, and was bound for the reliefe of the Rebells, and was taken before St. Davids head on the Coast of Wales, the Master further informed me, that he did beleeve Captain Iordan was gon for Milford, and I having a great desire to meet with Captain Iordan, I bore in for that Harbour, not knowing how he might be engaged, and in case I found him not there, then to desire the Gentlemen of that County to send Heu and Cry to apprehend divers pas∣sengers whō Captain Iordan had forced on Sheare before he got possession of the prize, and when I came before the Harbours mouth, a Fisherman came on board of me, who told me that in Milford there were two ships, men of War, the one was the fellowship of Bristoll, burthen about foure hundred Tunnes, of force, 24 Gunnes, having in her Foure Captains, viz. Captain Barnaby Burley, Captain Brooks, Captain William Hayle, and Captain Banister, the other was the Hart Friggot, wherein commanded Captain Richard Nesson, the said Captains had summoned aboard the Fellowship all the Gentry in those parts, and certified that the King had rasten Bristoll, and that all the Kingdom did now repaire unto his Maie∣stie to seek for his gracious pardon, and that the Parliaments forces were all overthrown, and that His Maiestie would suddenly march for London, all Kent being now in armes to assist the King, Chattom and Rochell were also taken, therefore they would advise that County presently to present a Petition to His Maiestie, in tender of their service unto him, and also to raise such a considerable sum of money, as they in their wisdom should
conceive meet to comply with His Maiesties occasions, and so come aboard them, and they would present them to His Majestie, but in case they should not doe this, then they and their posterity were ruined for ever, for Prince Rupert would immediately come down and Plunder their Countrey: And his Majestie had sent them out to command all his Maiesties ships, and o∣ther ships that were on that, or the Irish coast, that on their Allegiance they should repaire to Bristoll, and the Commanders & Marriners should have his Majesties gracious pardon, and the Commanders should receive from his Majestie both imployment, honour, and great reward, and the Marriners should have a large gratuitie, Vpon this intelligence, I called to me all the Officers of the Swallow, and then the ships company, informed them, what I had heard, and that the ship was rich, having aboard her, di∣vers goods belonging to the Marchants of Bristoll to preserve from plun∣dering, all which the owners of the ship had trayterously delivered with their ship into the hands of the Cavaleirs, And that if they would fight for it, their love and zeal to Gods cause would be made visible to all men, and it would very much daunt the enemie, and be a good example for others to trase them in the steps of vallour and vertue, Also it would manifest their thankfulnesse to the Parliament, who had conferred such favours, as first a gratuitie, then the increase of their wages, all which must needs bring a blessing on them, and I doe not doubt, but that it should please God to de∣liver the Ships into our hands, but that the Parliament would acknow∣ledge their constancy in gratifying their fidelity according to the value of the prize, and then demanding their resolutions, they cryed all as one man, God blesse the King and Parliament, and that they would stand by mee, to the last man, and then I bore in for the Harbour, it being monday the Seventh of August 1643. where I found the said Ship at Anchor, but the Commanders had made us from the top of a hill, before we came in, and had fitted their ships, and put aboard their Waystcloathes, and when I came within shot, there came off a Boat from the fellowship, towards the Swallow, and in it one Captain Iohn Brooks, holding forth a white flag, who desired a parley upon condition I would let him return aboard the Fellowship if we could not accord, to which I consented, then he came a∣board, and leaping down into the Wayst, he cryed, God blesse King Charles, to which we all said, Amen. The which being done, the said Captain desired to have some private conference with me, but I refused it, saying, I desire to hear nothing from him, but what the whole ships com∣pany might hear, but he pressed it the second time, and being denied the
said Captain turned himself to the ships company, relating unto them the words formerly specified in demonstrating the Kings grace and mercy ex∣tended towards us, in case we would comply and carry the ship to Bristoll, but then I commanded him to silence, saying, it did seem strange unto me, that he should dare to take the Kings name in his mouth, in regard that both he and his confederates appeared unto me to be Pyrats, and Sea-Rovers, in that they had taken and rifled a double Shallop that belonged to his Majesties Fleet, now on the coast of Ireland, having five small Guns in her, but the said Captain replyed, They had a Commission for what they had done, under the hand of Sir Iohn Pennington, and that Captain Hayle had another under the hand of Prince Rupert, and that Sir Iohn Penning∣ton was High Admirall by Patent under the great Seal of England; I told him I had no such intelligence of any such Patent, either from the Parlia∣ment, or from the Honourable the Earle of Warwick or any Order to obey it, and for that of Prince Rupert, he being a stranger, I could not perceive by what vertue or power his Highnesse could give Commission to any to rob, or take his Majesties ships, or other ships belonging to any of His Ma∣jesties Loyall Subjects. And therefore untill I could be better satisfied; I would use my best indeavour to seize on their persons, and ships, as Pirats, or sinck by their side. And in the interim of this discourse, the Swallow was come to Anchor on her broad side, and then Captain Brooks desired me to certifie so much in writing to Captain Burley; and while I went into the Cabine to write, the Fellowship had cut her Cable, and was under saile, intending to run a shoare; and being informed thereof by the Master, we came out, and I commanded the Gunner to give fire to a peece of Ordnance, the which was done; but within a Cable length the Fellowship came aground, and in pursuit of her, we cut and also came aground a little ahead of her, and then I gave her two peeces of Ordnance; whereupon Captain Burley ap∣peared on the Poope, and cried, Captain hold, hold; then I commanded him a board, who when he came told me he would deliver up the ship, if I would promise on the faith of a Gentleman to set the Commanders and ships company on shoare, or give them a double shallop to carry them to Bristol the which if I refused to doe, he had left those on board would set the ship on fire; then I replied unto him, that burne she should, for I was resolved not to part with any one man of them, for I valued them more then I did the ship: but in the meane time I had sent a letter to the Master & ships company, that if they would deliver up the other two Cap∣tains
with their ship, I did promise them all a free entertainment, and that they should have their wages paid, and all such goods as they could make appeare justly to belong to any of them: upon the receipt of which letter, the Master and Marriners did deliver up the ship without the losse or hurt of any one man (God be praised) only when the Hart Frigot par∣ted from us, to run a shoare, we gave her an unhappy shot, and killed two men, and hurt one; but Captain Nesson who commanded in her, carried her eight miles up the River, and ran her a shoare in a Creek; but she was pursued by Captain Rew Williams, and there was exchanged divers shot between them, but Nesson ran away with most of his men, and left her, and the next day Captain Williams brought her off, in which service, the Gen∣tleman doth crave his Lordships Protection: Having perfected this ser∣vice the next day, I set sayle in pursuit of my Admirall, to acquaint him with our proceedings, and also that Bristoll was lost, and the fleet is now repairing there to command out fleet, wherein Sir Iohn Pennington is to come out Admirall, that so we might use our best endeavours to nip these proceedings in the bud, and having acquainted my Admirall herewith, it is agreed on, that forthwith we repaire to Milford to endeavour to get our ships want of victualls supplyed, the which if we shall doe I hope God will enable us to perform some good service in the preventing of the com∣ming out of that fleet, either by inviting them to comply with us, or else to destroy them in the Harbour, And this is my Admiralls, and our con∣stant resolution, if it shall please God to enable us with victualls to subsist on this Coast, to which I doubt not, but our God will give a blessing in that he hath been pleased to give such good successe in the surprising of one of their best ships, as also the Friggot, the which is a great encouragement to us, and doubtlesse as great a disheartning unto them who seek their King and Countreys ruine, endeavouring to upheld that Antichristian beast, whom God hath said, Must down, to whose protection I commit you, and take my leave, and rest. From aboard his Majesties Ship the Swallow, making sayle for Milford, Aug. 17. 1643. Your most loving Brother to serve you, William Smith
Noble Sir, THe Character which Fame sounds in the eares of all men that come into the these parts of your worth, and the good affection you and the rest of the Gentlemen of this County beare to the publike Cause, whereon depends Gods glory, the Kings honour, and the peoples safety, is a sufficient motive to enduce me to present these, in discharge of the trust imposed, which is to keepe a compliance with all His Majesties loyall subjects, who in their refined judgements, have made no divisions or di∣stractions betweene the Kings Majesty, and His great Councell the Parli∣ment in England, and to engage my life in defence and preservation of such Worthies, is my duty, in which, I hope one day to appeare a loyall subject, and a faithfull servant, and if here I may doe my acceptable ser∣vice, I desire to receive your instructions, with which to my power I shall not faile to comply▪ & I shal also desire you and the rest of the Gentlemen of this County, to be pleased to send Hue and Cry to attach certaine wan∣dring and Rebellious persons, who were lately forced on the shore by the Expedition on this County, it is thought some Priests and Iesuites were amongst them, and that they have jewels and money, the which I am in∣formed they brought from Rochell in France, & were bound to the reliefe of the Rebels at Wexford in Ireland, the apprehending of these dangerous persons may happily prevent great evils which otherwise may ensue; and so every good man in discharging his duty to his God and his Countrey, it may be a meanes to hasten a speedy composure of these sad tragicall di∣stractions, the which our good God in his mercy grant, to whose protecti∣on I commit you, and take my leave and rest, August the 7. 1643, aboard the Swallow. Your frind to serve you, William Smith. The Answer. Allworthy Sir, I Much rejoyce at your constant perseveration and good successe, which I hope the Lord in his mercy will continue, and my prayers and meanes shall not be wanting, I have imparted your desire of supplying your wants of victuall unto the Gentlemen, whose willingnesse I presume will not be wanting, and this night I am assured to hear their answer, which I hope wil give you reall content, what lyes in my power to assist you; I shall not be wanting, being really to corroborate my protestation with my life and means, not any way daunted with the poor flawes of ill fortune that hath
lately befallen us, God will not suffer his chosen to suffer in the superlative degree, but greatly to chastise them, lest they attribute too much to the arme of flesh, God I hope & make no doubt) will make a period to these unnaturall civill Warres, and our Religion, Lawes, Liberties, preserved, in their desired purity, I desire to wait on you, but reserve my selfe till I receive your commands, in the interim I am your servant and present my service unto you and will remaine, August 9, 1643. Your friend to serve you, Griffith White. The Letter upon the same day. Noble Sir, SInce the last Letter I sent you this Post-noone, I understand by an ho∣nest Gentleman, who is as I am, that Hayle your now prisoner hath divulged in the presenee of some Gentlemen of quality of this County, that the inhabitants of this County should not reape their Corne, in case they did, they should not enjoy it, my desire is, that you would be pleased to vouchsafe this courteous favour, to examine and fish out the cause and ground of this report, and withall, if you find this to be true which cannot but prove prejudiciall the publike good, that you would write a letter, and direct it in generall to the Gentry of this County (omitting particulars) which I verily beleeve will turne the hearts of such who are now in the way of colapsing, since the taking of unconstant Bristoll, and unite their hearts with ours, who are constant to the Cause, I desire if your resolution comply with me (which I doubt not of) to hasten your Letter with all speed, which I know will be very thankfully received, and for my owne particular I shall and will remain your very loving friend to serve you, Grissith White. Most worthy Sir, TO satisfie you, and the Gentlemen of this County, in the contents of your last unto me concerning the menacing speeches thundered out by Hayle and his Confederates, that the Corn now on the ground should never be reaped by the Gentlemen and Commons of this County, or if it were, you should never enjoy it, are I assure you only the Bravadoes of a proud insulting Enemy, and grounded neither on judgement, or religion; for who but our only wise God can tell what shall be hereafter, or what 2 day may produced; and I am confident the Gentry of this County are
not ignorant of the power of the Almighty, that he is able to deliver as well by few as many, as is manifested unto you by multitudes of exam∣ples in his revealed word: wherefore to remove your feares, the only com∣fort I can give you is this, That in your Makers cause you would behave your selves as becometh good Christians, and valiant Souldiers of Christ Iesus, that you would gird on your swords, muster your Forces, put your selves in battell array, and quit your selves like men, putting your selves under Gods protection, doubt not but his Divine Majesty is both able and also will deliver all those that put their confidence in him; but without faith our Saviour would doe no miracles while he was here on the earth: wherefore in confidence of his assistance, there can be no greater mani∣festation of our faith then to engage our lives and estates in the mainte∣nance of his cause, which is the only meanes to preserve both. And I be∣leeve, that the Gentry of this County very well understand the condition of this warre, and that it is no other then between Christ and Antichrist, and that one day his Majesty will have great cause to acknowledge the fidelity of all such his loyall and obedient Subjects as have or do adhere unto his Majesty and his great Councell the Parliament of England, in the suppressing of that Antichristian Rout who have now taken up armes to destroy the Protestant Religion, the Kings honour, and dignities, the priviledges of Parliament, and the liberties of the Subject; in the pre∣servation whereof the Parliament have been forced to take up Armes, in which as I stand engaged, I shall be ever ready to assist and comply with all such his Majesties loyall and faithfull Subjects, so farre as God shall enable me, and my abilities give me leave; and in tender of my service herein to all the well-affected Gentlemen of this County, I take my leave and rest. Your faithfull Servant to be commanded in the serviee of God, the King, and Parliament, William Smith. FINIS.
