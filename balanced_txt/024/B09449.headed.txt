Loves Extasie: OR, Strephon and Cloas Corronation. Tho' Loves the only Coyn in Heaven doth go, Happy those Lovers are that pay below. To the Tune of, Ienny Gin, &c. AS Strephon did unfold his Flocks, just as the Sun did rise, He saw fair Cloa from the Rocks, which did his Soul surprize: Aloud he cry'd, make haste my love, make haste my dearest dear, To meet me in the Mirtle Grove, and feed our flocks all there. Her Milky Herd kept all around, i'th front she did appear, Old Trip and Nimble led the ground and White-foot in the Reer: Make haste my love, make haste, he said, make haste my dearest dear, My fair and lovely beautious Maid, we feed our Flocks all here. Beneath a Sycamore she lay, upon her Flocks to look, Some feed, some innocently play, and some were in the Brook: Aloud she cry'd, where is my love? where is my dearest dear? The Sun has Guilded all the Grove, yet Strephon is not here. She nimbly tript it to the Vale, and cry'd, where is my Dear? The Eccho gave her back her Tale, but Strephon was not there: Strephon indeed was all her care, quoth she, where is my Swain? Where is my love? where is my dear? that lets me thus complain. His love admits no longer stay, and hers did sympathize, She rose and met him on the way, and spoke with her fair eyes: Ah! here my Cloa, here's thy Swain, that does thy self adore, The truest and the happiest man, that ever lov'd before. But God what Oratry was there! as they walkt to her Grove, Vow and vow, and tear and tear, the Extract of all love: Till both with Extasie o'recome, upon the ground they lay, The God of pleasure struck 'em dumb. and envy'd both that day. FINIS. Printed for J. Deacon, at the Angel in Guiltspur-street.
