Ʒour Godly caus hes now tane gude succes In Ingland lait, I neid it not declair, Quhair my lord Chancelar tuik greit besines With your gude freind the Clerk of Registair Thair trauell, wit nor gudis yai did not spair For to vphald the Kings Authoritie, In presence of thay strangers that wer thair Working for him in his Minoritie. ☞Ʒe do tryumph, albeit that ʒe be few Ʒour enemeis thay dar ʒow not ganestand, Quhat ʒe do schaip, ye Lord him self dois sew Quhat ʒe deuyse, he wirkis it with his hand. Thairfoir mak haist, lat nane be in this land, To leif lyke Lords, syne proudly to rebell Gat thame baith sweir and subscriue ye band Or failʒe and this, do with thair leuings mell. And gif ʒe dreid, yat sum will ait his ouirhaill, And will not keip, nor ʒit obserue thair bands For startling hald the Kow fast be the taill Appoint nane sic but pledgis in ʒour hands. And keip thame sure, sen ʒe se as it stands For cum that tyme that all yat sort desyris, Thay wil but dout send ʒow in vncouth lāds To feicthe and feik, ʒour meit into the myris. Sen thair Intent, to ʒow was neuer gude As be thair deids richt cleirly may be sene Gif thame na leif to play with yow buk heid, As thay haif done, ay waitand on yair quene. Bot puneis all the quhilk ye knaw vnclene Of outher blude, & quyte yame for yair meids And spair all sic will serue his grace serene, And had na wyte of nouther of thair deids. I wald ye did sum mair at this Conuentioū, Nor did your fais at thairs thay held at Pace Quhat yai did yair, I neid not to mak mētioū Bot weill I wait, sū of yame rewis yat race. Ʒit top of wit was borne vp throw ye streit, This commoun well had stand in better cace Had it fallin in his toung fell in his feit. Sen God hes put the sword into your hand Iustice to do alyke to riche and pure, Tak heid yairfoir and na wise brek command Be circumspect of this your charge and cure Gif ye neglect, than God I yow assure Will frō pat rowme thoill yow to be detrusit Planting vthers into that charge ye bure And gif yat sword to yame can rychtly vsit. Be bent yair foir, and byde not this in blūder, Baith the word of God & cōmoun well auāce Ʒe neid na ma bot Gedioms thre hunder To quhip your fais or yai get help of France Mak to lyke mē sen ye half ordinance, Ding draffen doū yat hald quhairm yai pryde yame Bring in ye norh with bart bow & Lance, Gif thay rebell with tyre and sword ouir ryde yame how & quhat way ye suld appoīt your bordour Maddeis counsall is verray excellent Scho did prescriue ane gude & godly ordour That to performe, had ye bene diligent: Hard ye the pure, I wait ye wald lament Sa cruelty thay Tyranis dois oppres thame, Slaying yame selfis, yair gudis reit and rent For feir of God, I pray yow to redres thame. Quhat mā did hoip of grāge now dois appeir His clothit craft of malice dois outspring, As in his Proclamatiouns ye may heir He dois Rebell and will not serue the King, Tratours yai ar, agane yow to maling, He being Crownit in lauchfull Parliament, Quha daures fastest with him into yat Ring, To his Crowning baith sweir & gaif consent. Quhen the Regent gaif him that hauld ye saw He was the Kingis, & sweir thairfoir to stand, Albeit yat now, his grace he will nocht knaw, Nor ʒit Lennox for Regent of this land. Ʒit Robert Hepburne being in his hand And saifly entrit within that place, He said he was reset by his command And send Robert to my Lord Regents grace. Quhill yat he gat yat hauld and hous in hand, Into this caus he was baith bent and bauld Bot fra thyne furth than he gaif ouir yat band And in this caus he leit his curage cauld. This is the treuth as trew men to me tauld, That samin tyme his maister was on lyue He wald not lat him enter in that hauld with na seruands bot outher four or fyue. ☞He hes not onlie sueruit fra our actioun Bot dowbill murther he dois fotifie Desyring bargane of ony of our factioun, Of his degre, estait, and qualitie. We haue nane sic, ye knaw in cumpanie, Him for to match quhilk playit ye do whil knaif For first he slew ane Maister cruellie, And syne betraist the last ye may percaif. ☞Bot ʒit I knaw yair is ane hundreth heir Of gentill men, and cum of Royall Race On hors or fute, with quhinger sword or speir, Dar weill him matche, & meit him face for face And preif him fals and Tratour in this cace He dar not fecht for this is his refuge, He wald compeit at euery tyme and place Gif that he had ane vnspectit Iudge. ¶And als ye se, he planely dois accuse, The Regents grace of cruell Tyrannie Aganis his fais quhilk he doie schaw and vse In casting doun baith place and policie, Sen thay misknaw thair Iust Authoritie, And will not serue, nor ʒt obey commands Ʒe may be Law subuert thar places hie, Syne tak fra thame yair lyuis geit and lands. I knaw thir letters ye sand into Dunbartane Quhilk dois declair his dowbil deids Inding Is only caus, I am baith sure and certane Quhilk gartis him mak yis boist & manassing. ☞ Bot ʒit ye knaw it is ane commoun thing For weill I wait ye haue sene mony fle, Tuiche anis the gaw, & yan the hors wil fling Fra tyme ye spur and hit him on the quik. ¶It is your hous that maks him b sa bauld, Agane baith God and King for to disdane Except the Lord be watchman of the hauld, The Psalmist sayis thair watching is in vane As ye haue sene within thir monethis twane, Ane greiter strenth ye gat as I record, Swa will ye ʒone, to God gif ye b bane And swa commits your wisdomis to the Lord ¶FINIS. ☞Imprentit at Striuiling be Robert Lekpreuik.
