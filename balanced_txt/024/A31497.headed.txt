Certaine necessary RESOLUTIONS OF The most considerable Scruples now possessing the mindes of the major part of this Kingdome, now obstructing the in∣tended obedience which ought to be rendred to whatever Supreame Authoritie Is instantly or shall futurely be or∣dained over us. Wherein is likewise manifested and maintained the necessity of our submis∣sion thereunto, as to the Ordinance of God, against all the Sophisticall Reservati∣ons and alterations of the De∣vill, or humane policy. Directed to the due consideration of all who have (or may have) any affection to the tranquility hoped for in our languishing KINGDOME. By an earnest endeavourer for Peace and Truth. London, Printed for W. M. 1649.
Certaine necessary Resolutions of the most considerable Scruples now possessing the mindes of the Major part of this Kingdome. Deare Countrymen: I Conceive that all of you, who are worthily intituled Christians, do sadly sympathize in the Anxious ca∣lamities that our Nation hath so long groaned under; but the agra∣vation of our miseries continue springing from a corrupt Fountaine of depraved zeale, contrary to and ignorant of the manifold workings of God, instant and past providence in an evident, yet miraculous man∣ner, over us, and amongst us▪ it being impossible that even the calmest tempers can avoid distraction in times of unwonted mutation (though from evill to good) where judgements are wretchedly prejudiced, even against the most manifest demonstration of the Migh∣ties working powerfully for us. The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, and proves oftentimes desperately wicked, even in those determinati∣ons where conscince unseriously examined, seemes to render them good and holy▪ to a remisse understand∣ing;
We are new in times of tryall, and if the Al∣mighty weigh our fore-esteemed Gold in the Ballance of his sacred justice, proving it altogether lighter then vanity shall man repine to have his drosse (though even forcibly refined in the Furnace of his afflictions? it may well be conceived (and justly the Peoples eruptine discontents daily confirming it) that most of us had rather returne to the flesh pots and onions of Egypt, into stu∣pid captivity; then magnanimously attempt our pro∣mised and apparent deliverance through the difficult Wildernesse of opposition: But wee may justly feare that thus tempting God by our pusillanimity, when he so visibly appeares before us, may justly provoke him to bury us in the sands of our confusion before we at∣taine the promised estate of sanctified tranquility. No reasonable man is ignorant how difficult it is to unprinciple even the most evill resolutions of selfe in∣terressers; yet when the Mighty by Catagoricall argu∣ment, writ even in Characters of Judgement, leadga∣ble to the whole Nation, doth convince them of de∣pravation and folly; it were worse then madnesse for any to resist, even where sense declares, they kick against the pricks: Commune with your owne hearts therefore more seriously, and ponder all the sayings of Gods pro∣vidence, delivered in so many direfull judgements a∣gainst the enemies of, and extraordinary mercies to the fellow Labourers for our quietnesse; and if this sacred Volume will not afford you precedent for, and exhor∣tation to the imbracing of those things that really be∣long to your peace, when maturely and conscientiously applyed; yet you may happily live to see with your eyes what hereafter, as now, God will justly blinde you who not understand and partake of in your affections, viz: even the prosperous condition of this now distur∣bed Nation, wrested forth of so much bitternesse and violent oyposition, as it is inthralled under at this day. But in respect so many consciences pretend them∣selves
to be yet unresolved (or rather irreasonable) some being wretchedly, some obstinately ignorant; and fre∣quently pretend scruples, concerning the possible law∣fulnesse of becomming obedient to and affectionately for the intended future Government, in regard that most by their Oath of Allegiance, many others by the bonds of their Covenant, stand ingaged, to their thinking, with their lives and fortunes to abet and main∣taine Monarchy, and utterly and forcibly to exclude, re∣ject, and extirpate all other Methods for common safe∣ty or Government, although they truly appeare, even in some of their owne understandings, both laudable, lawfull, and most advantagious for any other Com∣mon-wealth, (so slily doth the Devill suggest that for Divinity, which will prove very Machiavilianisme in fitting those scruples for firebrands of future dissen∣tion) It will therefore be most requisite to consider, wherein chiefly we have just cause of scruple in case of such urgent necessity where God so powerfully effe∣cteth his owne will, and then to examine whether re∣sistance in the same case, be not absolutely against the Ordinance of God, which will inevitably render dam∣nation to the opposers in the event. And herein I would not be mistaken for partiall, or private in affection to this course of Gods working in and upon our Nation; for I ingeniously confesse, I have ever held Monarchy to be the most absolute consist∣ent with, and best forme of Government for any Peo∣ple to whom God seales not his remarkable evidences of unwillingnesse for it; but when a People (as wee have done) shall turne such an excellent grace of God into wantonnesse, when our slavish insinuating flattery shall cry non vox hominum sonat, to the destructive dictates of a Prince, forced by our wretched acclamations to overswell with ambition above the bounds of paternall duty to his People, well may that King be tooke away in Gods displeasure from a People, that dishonour
the giver in Idolizing so rich a gift. But to the purpose, and in pursuance of the first consideration, viz. wherein we have just cause of scru∣ple, (in respect of Oath or Covenant made or taken) in case of such urgent necessity, where God so power∣fully demonstrateth and effecteth his owne Will in change of our Government? In relation whereunto, this Quaere will requisitely be resolved, Whether Kings, as being Gods annoynted, have not a perpetuall priviledge by their originall in∣stitution, to stand as the onely allowed Vicegerents, and (under God) Supreame of their People? To which we grant, That Moses was instituted and appointed King in Jesurum, Saul and David over Israel; but if we inquire whether Gods respect, chiefly to his People, or of these particular Kings were intended by their Ordination, the story of Israels afflictions in E∣gypt cleeres it, that properly for their good of generall deliverance, and not for benefit of fingular Majestie or Supremacy to Moses, was he called of God to that great worke; from whence we may plainy argue, that the good of a People is in supreme esteeme with God, and not the Majestike advancement of Princes over them; and doubtlesse, (for the holy Spirit in the whole course of that and the like Storie eplaines it) God more cleerely shewed supreme respect to the Peoples publique deliverance, then to Mse his Calling, in re∣gard he was but to serve God and his People in the mighty worke; Now were there such an irresistable force in the Supreme Priviledge of this primary insti∣tution, that it were not lawfull for God (proceeding from this Ordinance) by man, or man from God, to alter the manner of a Peoples Government, seeing all Governors are  to the People how comes it that this Royall Ordinance was so speedily changed in the time of the same Peoples Government by Jud∣ges: None dares affirme without blasphemy but that
their Government by Judges was approved and confir∣med by the same God that before gave them a King. And if so, how inconsistent with the good of any Na∣tion will it prove, to urge for that as Supreme, which God hath and will put under their feet: Saul and Da∣vid were after this elected Kings, (at the Peoples impor∣tunity for that Government) by God himselfe, but how displeasing the manner of their desires were the Story evidences. And you may reade how short a suc∣cession of totall Government in Israel was assigned both to Saul and Davids Posterity; might not Israel in their revolt from Reboboam have scruplized as much to have discerted him, and change (though not their Govern∣ment) their Governors; but we finde the Spirit records it to have been the will of God, which if Reboboam had resisted, even himselfe had perished. Nor from hence it cannot be supposed that Israel in their act of Revolt proved opposers of, but operating Instruments for the then effecting of the revealed will of God, whether to judgement upon themselves for former transgressions or not, is not here necessarily disputable; but most cer∣tainly, God intended, and did thus mightily manifest his owne liberty to alter the Government of his people, even by subordinate instruments, which evidence both himself and Israel disobliged from an irrevocable con∣tinuance of that originall institution of Davids House to be Kings over all Israel; And if so, questionlesse a people so experienced in Gods powerfull workings for a change over and amongst us, as we are, and wherein his will by his works (and our continued offences ap∣peare so manifestly for it,) need not (when we are thus forcibly by the power of God in man, dis-ingaged of all bonds to what is of present existence) though for∣merly according to his will, startle to become obedi∣ent even with all willingnesse of minde to that pre∣sent or future Government which doubtlesse will be established; and according to his will, as we hope in mercy, although we have just cause of doubt in regard of our transgressions.
Nor will this case of conscience prove so rigidly re∣solvable with you whose luke-warmnesse or feareful∣nesse hath from the beginning of our troubles detained you in Neutrality; for it is far easier for him who hath nor made it a sinne to his owne conscience in concei∣ving it so) to have had either hand or heart in degra∣ding that Authority which you conceive unquestiona∣bly good, (but hath not dared to contend for) to re∣solve obedience to, and imbrace that good which is tenderd you without sweating for or against, than for any other whose depraved judgements have despe∣rately hurried them through an boast of sound reasons to strike at the very head of such an establishment, and whose violent motions still speake their implacable ha∣tred to it. But you will say, all this proves not the necessity of a present alteration amongst us or the lawfulnesse of it by any power which you conceive subordinate, in re∣gard the Apostle so expresly chargeth obedience upon every soule unto the higher powers which both by Oath of Allegiance and Covenant you have inclusive∣ly sworne to remaine properly in the King. For solution of which (in relation onely to those who have not ingaged in contest for any alteration, the rest being supposed satisfied in their owne mindes al∣readie) we mnst consider that such Oathes oblige sub∣jection no further then to extant your Authority; And although conscience, from the tenure of such Oathes, may justly urge obedience to be given to an es∣sentiall remaining power; yet they binde not any to obey what really is not, nor to resist what inevitably must be; and as the power that is extinct was ordained of God, so that power that will be confirmed by him, upon safe and in certaine powers, will prove it selfe to be immediately by the same will from the same God, whether in mercy or judgement towards us, the event according to our faith or diffidence in him will evidence.
Now wherein any further scruple concerning present or future conformity remaines, I am ignorant and the ra∣ther confident that there is justly none, in respect that it is manifest that God in divers ages, and to divers Nations, hath granted other formes of Government besides Mo∣narchy, even with pprobation, the certainty whereof re∣maines upon Record, both divine and humane, (as is well knowne to all that have been any thing studious in either) and if divine providence signe a remarkable change a∣mongst us, with his approbation of it by so many wonder∣full works, both of his mercy for, and judgement against the proceedings of the present Authoritie, that as none under it must necessarily leade us to examine whether re∣sistance mentall or active in this case will not prove it selfe to be against the Ordinance of God. St. Paul tels us indefinitely, That the Powers that are are ordained of God; then if an overweening affection to the past power (though admitted it selfe to be princi∣pally the best) shall not onely hinder our conformity to a present Ordinance of God, but move us to resolve upon mentall reservations for resistance thereof, it being so cleerely evidenced that is is the will of God so to consti∣tute such a power as we are in all likelihood to fall under, without doubt such opposition will be verily and imme∣diately against the Ordinance of God, which must needs precipitate the resisters into that consequent gulphe of condemnation mentioned in the same Text. But Countrymen, I hope better things of you all, let not selfe interests therefore or obstinacies deceie the ex∣pectations of the peacefully minded amongst us, for your Christian correspondence and conjunction with them in unanimous obedience; our innumerable divisions alrea∣dy raging amongst us, are more then enough to provoke the God of peace, even yet for a long season to suspend us that heavenly blessing▪ and it may be justly feared, that our refusall of it upon tearmes so apparently consonant with his immediate will, will provoke him even utterly to expose us to a generall destruction. We are not unmindfull that the Silver Smithes of Ephe∣sus
may urgently and politiquely argue for the worship of Diana, even against the Apostles of Christ in a tumultu∣ous manner, the almost publiquely private interests of many thousand families in respect of subsistence and live∣lihood, being properly and solely supported by a Regall Government, may pleade much for it. But notwithstand∣ing, although these may more justly call for confideration of provision for, then the case of the Ephesians (no one in∣terest amongst them in it selfe absolutely depending upon suppression of the Gospell) yet the publike peace of a Na∣tion instantly and futurely to be established, cannot rea∣sonably or religiously be held obstructable because many continuing dis-affected to it, may happily perish by it; yet doubtlesse God will in his good providence by his In∣struments in present Authority over us, so provide for those whose obstinacy towards, and diffidence in them, are not the just occasions of their punishment by want and beggery) that even the extreamest downcast amongst us by that meanes may at least have abundance in content. If we would reflect upon our Saviours example (who was obedient even to an usurper, and yet knew himselfe to be the absolute King of Judi successively legitimate ac∣cording to the flesh) We could not but condemne that zeale for extreame preposterous, which animates any pri∣vate man upon any specious pretences whatsoever to re∣sist, or not became obedient unto that present Authoritie we live under. Doubtlesse had it been of Divine allow∣ance, that way to have disturbed the present peace our Sa∣viour was not so stupedly bent to let Caesar remaine impunable for his usurpation, but his exemplary subje∣ction, (though the King clearely intimates how precious a Kingdomes concord ought to be much more unto us; which who endeavours to disturbe, upon any pretence; will finde it culpable in the highest nature, and justly me∣riting condigne punishment; a sad example whereof we are shortly to have delivered us in the eminentest of In∣struments, But you will say, a man may be actually quiet, and out∣wardly subject to the present Government, and yet in con∣science
reserve internall obedience, even for his memory to, and hopes of regall Government to be restored. But I conceive such halfe obedience can never prove an acceptable sacrifice, gither to God or thy Countries peace, for the stench of reserved sedition for every provocation thereunto, will render it abominable both to God and thy Country. If halting betweene two opinions would bring a man to heaven, who would not prize hypocrisie as a Jewell! or if temporizing would render  honest upon all tri∣als, what need were there of  of integrity? he that is not with our Saviour it against him; if therefore any man resolve upon non-conformity yet as the least his condem∣nation will be the lesse that seemes no friend to what he re∣ally abhors: Therefore if any such be, it will best became them (though passively) to possesse their soules in patience, knowing that all clandestine endeavours of humane policy, however flourished over with sophistry, cannot alter the imutable decree of the Almighty in any thing, much lesse in a matter of so ponderous , as the Govern∣ment of a Nation; the event of the highest humane at∣tempt in this nature, having ever amongst all Nations ren∣dred them rashly evill and manifestly both fruitlesse, and severely punishable, our own sad and decre bought experi∣ence in the whole progresse of our late miserably protra∣cted Warre, sufficiently of it self instanting it to every in∣genious capacitie. But in respect conscience seems with so many to be inga∣ged to indeavour by forcible meanes to establish truth a∣monst our people according to their owne method (Reli∣gion having been ever made a deale for all insurrections) I earnestly desire to be resolved how it is possible for any people to professe and indeavour for a forme of godlinesse, and not deny the power of it in disturbing publique peace to establish it, since the fruits of the spirit are defined to be, love peace, gentlenesse, &c. subjection to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake (either actively or passively with patience and long suffering) being an absolute necessary con∣comitant.
