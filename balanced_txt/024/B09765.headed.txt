PRAEDICTIONS Christian and Political, IN Several Remarkable Expressions Taken from the Last Words of some of those Persons who Dy'd On Account of the Late (Pretended) POPISH PLOT, Wherein they seem to Fore-tell a clear Discovery of Their Innocence, and of the Perjury of their Accusers. MR. Langhorn (who was Executed July the 14th. 1679.) in a Letter to his Friend a little before his death, hath these words: God taketh Our Cause for His Own Concern, and will (in due time) discover the Perjuries of these Men, to the shame and confu∣sion of those who thirst after our Blood. WIlliam Viscount Stafford (Beheaded on Tower-hill, De∣cember the 29th. 1680.) towards the end of his Last Speech saith thus: I have great confidence that it will please Almighty God, and that He will in a short time bring Truth to light; then You, and all the World, will see and know what Injury they have done Me.
MR. Thomas Thwing, (Executed at York, October the 23d 1680.) at the end of his Last Speech, saith, Though I know the Affairs of the Kingdom are in a bad posture yet I hope they will be cleared e're long; and then the Actors thereof will be more fully known. DR. Oliver Plunket, (Executed July the 1st. 1681.) in Letter to his Friend the day before his Execution: I doubt not but there will soon be an end of this Persecution, an the Iniquity of many will shortly be revealed. MR. Thomas Jennison (who being accused of the Plot, dy'd a Prisoner in Newgate) left in his Chamber this Chro∣gram upon our Saviour's words, John 16. verse 20. trIstItIa Vestra VertetVr In gaVDIVM. aLLeLVIa. Englished thus: yoVr sorroVV shaLL be MaDe Very IoyfV Vnto yoV. This may be Printed; Ap. 12. 1686. Ro. L'Estrange. London: Printed by T. M. for the Author, MDCLXXXVI.
