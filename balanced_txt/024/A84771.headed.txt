CONCERNING Good-Morrow, AND Good-Even; The Worlds CUSTOMS: BUT By the Light which into the world is come, by it made manifest to all who be in the dark∣ness. G. F. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth neer Aldersgate, 1657.
Concerning Good-Morrow and Good Even, &c. TO all you that stumble at them that to you cannot say God speed you, and bid you have a Good Night, and wish you to have a good Morning, or a good Evening: Now we which be in the Light, and know the Day, who witness the Father and the Son, and to such as are here we can say God speed, and not be partakers of their evil deeds: And the children of the Day which witness the darkness past, and the night over, and to the light turned from darkness, and the works of it, good Day to them is here, and good Morning is here: But now to bid God speed to evil workers, cursed speakers, drunkards, and cheaters, coze∣ners, them that use false weights and deceitful measures in their merchan∣dizing, in their common occasions and works, to bid God speed to them are not these partakers of their evil deeds, and blind to tell them so, whose works are not wrought in God, to tell them they have a good Evening, or a good Night, or a good Day, that are doing mischief, devouring and de∣stroying the Creation in drunkenness, in devouring, cozening, in Idolatry, Adultry, Fornication, Theft, Murder, wronging one another in pride, lof∣tiness, presumption, seeking where they may accomplish their lusts, to tell them they have a good Night, or a good Day, which appears they be in the evil day, and the hour of darkness, doing the works of darkness; let all that fear God judge of these causes, and what a custom of words hath carryed away people, and what a garment the workers of iniquity wear, and the e∣vil doers, whose works are evil, who would have God speed said to them, and Cozeners, and Cheaters, and Brallers, and Lyars, and Swearers, and Persecutors, would be told that their day was good, and their night is good, and their Evening, and God speed their work, who are found out of the
works of God, who are found in the night of darkness, and the evil day, that the evil rules; [mark] while the evil rules, and the works of darkness rules, and adultery rules, drunkenness rules, swearers rules, cozeners, cheaters, persecutors, brawlers, lyars, swearers, drunkards rules, murder∣ers, thieves, adulterers, whoremongers, idolaters, fornicators, proud and lofty ones, whiles these rules, its the evil day; this is the day of evil, the evil hath his day now here; and to say the evil day is a good day, is to speak a lye; and this must have its evening, and this must have its morning; and to say good morning when this begins, and a good evening when this ends, is it not here to call evil good, call the evil day a good day, and the evil eve∣ning a good evening; mark; And while the evil day is, is not the Dogs-days there; hath not they the liberty to bark and devour, and all subtile Foxes there, and the Swine wallowing in the mire and lusts; so to say they have a good day that live in the evil day, and these who are workers of iniquity, and are doing the Devils work in his day, his subjects, and such would have said to them, they have a good day, and a good evening, and God speed their work; but such as dwell in truth cannot call evil good, nor can∣nor bid God speed their work, except they be partakers of their evil deeds, while lyars, cheaters, defrauders rules; these are works of darkness, these are the evil Day, and the evil Evening, and when they begin these works of darkness, its  the evil morning, so they call it. And such as live wantonly upon earth, eating and drinking, and rising up to play, and sporting themselves in pleasures while they live, which be dead while they live, and wanton upon earth, which kills the Just; and they that kills the Just, they be in the evil day; and against such before mentio∣ned the Lords hand is turned; and such as be in the evil day, against whom the Lords hand is turned, they be in the transgression, which be in the evil day, and all which be workers of darkness, cozeners, cheaters, deceitful workers, unrighteous, ungodly, and dissemblers, and deceivers, these be all in the evil day, in the evil morning, or the evil evening, which is neither good morning, nor good day, nor good evening; neither is Gods speed to these works, nor deeds, least there be a partaking of them; and now is the evil day discovered, and the evening of it, and the morning of it, the day of evil, the evil and his day; the day is come that hath discovered it, and the works of it, and such as are doing his works in his day, which would de∣stroy and murder, because the children of the Light cannot bid God speed their work, and tell them their morning is good, and their day is good, and their evening its good, the children of the Light cannot lye to call evil good; evil morning is to them that are beginning to work wickedness, and to do iniquity, until they come to the evil day, and the evil evening, the evil speed is now, where the power of evil guides, working in the evil, is going on to the evil day, and to such the children of the Light cannot say God speed, who witness the good morning, who witness the good day, who witness the Father and the Son, and bringeth this Doctrine, and can say
this Doctrine, God speed, and not be pertaker of any evil deed; but to say to such who doth the evil and owns not the Light that comes from Christ, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and be in the evil deeds, wrought out of God, they cannot say to them, God speed, unless they be partakers of their evil deeds. So here is the evil day seen, while he rules and hath Dominion; and here is the good day known, when he is bound, and the morning of it; and such witness the good day, and the good morning, and see all that the Lord hath made to be good, very good, to say God speed to that which is going on in the power of the evil, guided with the power of evil, all may see whether this be right or wrong, to say to a company of men and women that are at pleasures, and sporting themselves, and eats, and drinks, and riseth up to play, and lives wantonly upon earth, against whom Gods anger is; to bid such God speed, how can we say so but be partakers of their evil deeds? And likewise when a company are mocking, men or women, reproaching, scoffing, scolding; passing by them bidding them God speed, to bid them God speed, how can we do it but be partakers of their evil deeds? for here shews that the Father and the Son they know not, but the Enemy, the Ad∣versary, the Devil, and his works they do. And to come among a company of men and women that are drinking, swearing, Musick, Shovel boards, Cards, Dice, to come into the house, how can he to them say God speed, but to be partaker of their evil deeds; for a drunkard and a swearer makes the Land mourn; a drunkard casts the Law of God behind his back; and these shew to be evil deeds: Or to come into a Market where people are at their Merchandise, these being selling their Merchandise, or meeting them going to Market with their Merchandise, where there is deceit, cheating, cozening, oppressing grinding, defrauding one the other, and more then yea and nay in their communications, which is evil; how can we say to these God speed, but we must be partakers of their evil deeds? And to come among a company of people that are making vanities, toys, or Baubles, or making things that are serviceable, and they themselves have self ends, and covetous, and griping, and deceitful Trades, men who labour for others, and works for others, thieve, or covet, or wrong; how can any say to them God speed, but he shall be partaker of their evil deeds. When men cannot speak in their bargaining without a lye in their mouths, and can any say unto such God speed, but they must be partakers of their evil deeds? If any man among you brig not this Doctrine that he hath the Father and the Son, receive him not into your Houses, neither bid him God speed, least you be partakers of his evil deeds; who hath the Son hath the righteousness of God, and who hath the Father hath the righte∣ousness it self; and to say God speed to such who hath the Father and the Son, and bringeth this Doctrine, who hath this they shall be free from the
evil deeds, who say God speed to such; but to say God speed to such who hath not the Father and the Son; hath not, (mark) that hath not the Father and the Son, such are not to be received into houses, neither to say God speed, least you be partakers of their evil deeds. And such are the partakers of the evil deeds of them which bids them God speed, that hath not the Father and the Son; and they that have not the Father and the Son, have the evil deeds; for to say to the Harlot which deceives the simple, whose way is death; or to say to such as keep Whores, or Stew-houses, as they call it, where wickedness is, to say God speed to such, can they say God speed to such, and not be partakers of their evil deeds? Or to say God speed to such as are Murderers, can they say to such, and not be partakers of their evil deeds? Can they say God speed to a company of Thieves, or Adulterers, or Whoremongers and Idolaters, but be partakers of their evil deeds; and finde a company of men, and a company of women doing mischief in the street and high way, slandering & back-biting, & in∣venting evil against their neighbor, to tel them they have a good Morning; can they speak this and not speak a lye, though the Morning be good, but they are not doing the good; when the morning-light come, these sins are practised. And to see a company of men going to a Market, whose intent is to co∣zen, and cheat, and oppress, and covet, to tell him he hath a good day, or a good morning, is not he here in the evil day? To come into company, or to see a company, or to meet a company of men or women that are given to drunkenness, or cursing, or sports, or plea∣sures, or cozening, or cheating, or lying, or dissembling, or back biting, or scolding, to tell them they have a good day, and a good morning; is not this the evil day? to tell them they be in the evil day, is not that more pro∣per, or the evil day is to them; but to tell them good day is to them, it plea∣seth them, and so it pleaseth the lyar to tell a lye, or to tell a man or a wo∣man as they meet them going into their grounds, who may be is intended if he see Cattle, or so, to destroy them, or lame them, or do his Neighbor a mischief; if he see his Neighbors goods, to covet and lust after them; to tell him he is in the good Morning, and in the good Day, when he is in the utter darkness, practising the works of darkness, and full of mischief, to come into a Town among a company of Tradesmen, Traffickers, Buyers and Sellers, who over-reaches one another in their Bargains, who in their com∣mon occasions are above yea and nay, cozening and cheating one another, covetting after one anothers Goods, Wives, and Servants, or Cattle, or o∣ther creatures, to come and flatter them, and tell them a good day is to them, this will please them, which be in the evil day, and not come to the morning, though the morning which the visible eye sees is good, and the day good; but they in the evil day, and the day is evil to them, and the mor∣ning a morning of mischief, that when they come to see to do, they act evil, so grow up till they come to the evil day.
So to say they have a good Evening, or a good Morning to them who who are going in the Evening to do mischief, if it may be to steal a com∣pany of Horses, or to steal a company of Sheep; or a company of lewd peo∣ple go to Whoredom, Fornication, say a good Even to them pleaseth them, or you have a good Morning when Judgements is to come upon them, who are going to do the works of darkness, to say a good Evening, or a good Night to such as are going to abuse their Neighbors Cattle, who are going to thieve his Corn, his Redge, his Hey, his Clothes; to say the Evening is good to him, pleaseth him, and he hath a good Evening. Or to see a company, or meet a company that are mocking, scoffing, stocking, slandering, backbiting; find them in this work, say they have a good Evening, is not this to tell a lye? Or to come into a Town among a company of Shop-keepers which do cozen and lye in their Bargains, cheat one the other; and to tell them they have a good Evening, is not this to tell a lye? And to tell all Tradesmen whatsoever in time of Night or Evening, it is the time then to them to work wickedness, and to cozen, and cheat, and lye, and rob; and to tell them they have a good Evening, or a good Night, is not this to tell a lye, and to flatter, though the Night outwardly be good. To tell a company that is going to an Ale-House or Tavern to drink or roar, to abuse the creatures of God, to tell them they have a good Night, the Night is good. Or to meet a company of men that is going abroad to seek their prey, to wrong, and devour, and destroy one another, to say he hath a good Night or a good Day, is not this to them and him an evil day? let the Light in all your consciences answer and judge; though the Night is good in it self, and the Day is good in it self, for all that God made was very good; but must there not be an account given for all vain words? Now to come to a company of Tradesmen whatsoever, that in their Trades there are wronging, cheating, cozening, they are slighting the work, they are abusing it, they do it not righteously. And who are using deceitful Weights and Measures in bargaining, to say to them God speed your work, is not he that saith so partaker of his evil deeds? Whether is it better to say Fear God and be just, and do the things that is right. To come to a company of Husbandmen, or other men that are about the creatures in the Creation, doing their occasions, who are envying the Cattle, bruising the Cattel, cursing of them, defrauding one another; and some may be doing for others work, and slight over the thing they have in hand, and do it not faithfully; to say to these, God speed their work, are they not partaker of their evil deeds? for saith the Priest and people, There are none that doth righteous, no not one; then they do evil; and how can I say to him that doth not righteousness, but partake of his evil deeds? How can
I say to him he hath a good Day, and a good Evening, when he is in the Night of Darkness. And the Priests and People say while they be upon Earth they must commit sin; and sin is of the Devil, and he that commit it is of the Devil; and how can I say, God speed him that commits sin? Must I say God speed him in his wayes? Is not that to imbolden him in his wayes, put him on a Garment there, put him on a cover? To bid him God speed, can any do so but be partaker of their evil deeds? Is it not bet∣ter bid them repent? And if while they be upon earth they must commit sin, is not sin the evil deed, doing the Devils deed; to bid God speed to a Priest, to a Teacher, or to a Professor, that tells me while he is upon earth he must commit sin, are not these them that must not be received into their Houses, nor bid God speed, least we partake of their evil deeds: We are the House of God, this is not to be received into the House: We are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, born of God, a spiritual Houshold, turned from sin; who are turned from the sin are the Houshold of God, where the sin entreth not, nor the evil deed, And hath not this Baals Worship stood out of the Light, that so rageth now, who acts the evil deeds, that is not bid God speed, who acts the evil deeds before mentioned; and they cannot tell them that be in the evil day, they have a good day; and cannot tell them that be in the works of Darkness, that they have a good day, or a good Evening, that maketh the Heathen to rage now, that the madness and folly of this appears now both in Professors, Priests and people. And again, is there not a mighty Monster brought forth in the world and in these Nations, that if you be not spoke to, this birth brought forth, born of the Monstrous Woman, it swells, and is full of fury and madness if they speak thou to him; doth not this shew that 'tis not the birth born of the spirit which gave forth Scripture, which said thou to a particular, and you to many, and thou to God, and thou to Christ; but is not this birth born of the great Mystery Babylon, the Mother of Harlots, since the days of the A∣postles; and now her Son reigns, and hath been set up as King. At this Monster born of the flesh, the very word thou strikes at his brow, and makes him to rage, and he is found out of the life that gave forth Scripture; now to speak you to him, to make him a number, to set him up in his place, make him a Monster, pleaseth him; and this Monster born of the flesh hath outstripped all the uncircumcised Philistines and Heathen that were before him, before all his fellow-Kings, for he is the head of them all, and persecutes now before them all; for we never read that any persecu∣ted for thou before, and saith thus, Thou me, and I will turn them out of their places; for if he hath not the Hat bowed to him, he rageth, and is mad, and full of fury, yea, he will fine and imprison; and this is the Monster brought forth in our age, to the view of all the children of Light, born of the im∣mortal seed, of the Word of God, who speaks the pure Language, and bows to the Lord, and respects no mans person, but are of the royal Law
of God, which convinceth them to be Transgressors that doth respect mens persons; and this brings them to thou particulars, and thou God and Christ, and you many, who are come to the form of sound words, and speaks righ∣teously. But this Monster, this birth, this Monster that is brought forth of the Monstrous woman that hath harlotted from the spirit that gave forth Scripture, and Gods voice hath not heard, respects persons; and if his per∣son be not respected, likewise he rageth, frowns, envies, threatens; and if he have thou spoken to him (the pure Language of the children of the Lord, born of the spirit (according to that which gave forth Scripture) he likewise rageth, sumes, cannot endure to stay in the sight of the children born of the spirit that will not bow his hat to him, to the Monster, but thou him, oh! away with him to prison, I cannot endure he should stand before me; away with him that is born of the spirit, the sons of God, and with them to prison, saith this Monster born of the monstrous woman, the mother of Harlots; and this is the Tydings, and that which is brought forth in these our dayes. But he that hath reigned is now known, the birth reigns that hath the pure Language, which disquiets the birth born of the flesh; that is brought forth of the Lord knows him, knows his Mother, and his Dominion, and all his raging and railing subjects, and he shall turn to corruption, and enter into the fire, and that which brought him forth, and with him all his subjects, and shall pass away as a blast, and the sons, and daughters shall reign, and take the Kingdom of God, and it in shall dwell everlastingly, and shall sing of the glory that they are made partakers of, and do inherit over all the earth, who to the Marriage of the Lamb are come, and the Bridegroom sees, who wears the VVedding-Garments, which are not defiled with this woman, nor her son the Monster; neither do they fear his fury and rage, but sees his rage must have an end; that doth aggravate (because they are not troubled) more to his misery and sorrow, upon whom the sword of the Lord is laid. And you that can say God speed to them that be in the evil deeds, be not you partakers of them? are not you contrary to the Apostles Doctrine? and they have not the Father and the Son that are doing the works of the Devil.
And to you that be not satisfied with these things before mentio∣ned, some Queries I shall give you to answer. Query I. HAth he the Father and the Son that is doing the works of the Devil, and his works not destroyed yet; and was not the Son manifested to destroy these works; and is he to have God speed said to him that is in the Devils work; now if you say, VVho is out of them, Such in whom Christ is manifested, who are the children of the day, who witness the Father and the Son, to whom the God speed is spoken. Query II. VVhat is the evil day? is not the murder and the wickedness acted in that day? Hath not Cozeners, Cheaters, Deceivers, Oppressors, Persecutors, Adulte∣rers, and VVhoremongers, Swearers, and Drunkards this day? Is not the righ∣teous sad when this day approacheth? and can the righteous say to such they have a good Morning, that these that be in the evil day have a good Morning without calling evil good. Query III. And have not all that work wickedness, Sorcery, and VVitchcrast, and them that do oppress one another, and wrong the innocent, and thieve, and cozen one a∣nother, have not they this evil day? And when they begin to work this, to work wickedness, doth not their day approach? Is this day good morning, or he that leadeth his life in this manner, in wickedness, coming to the evil day, coming to∣ward the end of it, is that a good Evening? Query IV. And doth them that live in wickedness, in this evil day, regard the time that is in the Fathers hand? Doth not them that live in the evil day, the day of the evil, destroy the handy works of God? And are not those that destroy the handy works of God, are not their works evil? And what must it be said God speed to their works, and them in the night? Query V. And are they not all yet doing the works of darkness that are not turned to the Light, and yet under the power of Satan? And is there any that be under the
power of Satan, in the darkness, doing the works of God; and is any to be said God speed to, but such who are doing his works, and are they that have the Father and the Son, and are come out of the evil, and out of darkness into the marvelous Light. Query VI. And what is it to speak idle words? is it not to speak words out of their ser∣vice and place? and is it not that which is spoken cut of its place, out of its ser∣vice, idle, and must there not account be given for them in the day of Judgement of every idle word. Query VII. Is not the ground and root of all idle words from him who abode not in the truth? And is not that evil that leadeth into the vanity, into bondage, the creature into bondage under the corruption; is not the light the truth? and doth not that make free from the bondage of corruption, and brings to speak words that he shall not be judged for them; in their service and in their place, which are not idle; is not all the idle words that must be given account for in the Day of Judgement, out of the truth, and from them that serves him who is out of the truth. So ye who say your Tongues are your own, you ought to speak that are not satisfied in the things before mentioned; answer these Queries, and let not the polluted lips utter forth words without the true understanding; let not your evil communication corrupt your good manners, but come to the witness of God in you, that you may know the bridle, that whereby the love may be known without dissimulation, and your words known without hy∣pocrisie, whose lips speak righteously, in whose mouth there is no guile; the lying tongue hath been beheld, and the polluted lips heard to utter the Hy∣pocrisie, crying Ha, ha, our tongue is our own; (these) so hath said God speed your work, with the same tongue said, He do him a mischief; and which hath said, Good Morrow, a good Morning, or a good Evening, with the same tongue fell a railing, and lift up his hands full of blood to destroy him, and yet saith to him Good Morning, may be in his heart to steal his Cattel, or rob him, or do him a mischief, or cozen him, or cheat him, covering his goods, and yet tell him its a good Evening; can the other say that is out of Truth, this is the good day, the good morning, the good evening; is not this the evil day, and the evil works that be out of Truth; which works are to be destroyed, and not to it to be said God speed; is it not their works who be in the evil day, to consume, to destroy the handy works of God; and are these works to be said God speed to? Or is not Gods hand turned against such whose work it is to destroy Gods handy works? And is not the Nation, and hath not the Nation been full of these that hath not regarded his handy works, neither seen time and seasons in his hand, nei∣ther is known the bit nor the bridle, but their Tongue hath uttered perverse things, and lying vanities, and men seek after lyes, who be out of the Truth and the Light, and they make lyes their refuge; God is not their re∣fuge,
but their lyes: Blessed is the man whose God is the Lord, whose re∣suge he is, for he will sweep away all the refuge of lyes, saith the Lord; and the Lord having swept away the refuge of lyes, that he alone may reign and be the refuge of his people; These are they that abhors the Light, [mark] they that do abhor the Light, they know not the way there∣of, nor continue in the path thereof, mark, the path of the Light; these are the Murderers that kills and the greedy who thieve in the night, and the eye of the Adulterer, who waits for the twi-light, and saith, No eye can see me; and these disguise their faces; mark, They dig through Houses in the dark which they mark for themselves in the day; they know not the Light; mark, its a Day they know not, they know not the Light, nor the path of it, but abhor it; but the Morning is Evening to them, as the shadow of death; if one know them, they are in the terror of the shadow of death; (mark and take notice of this, VVho continue in the path of the Light, Job 24. Now if you say you wish the good day or the good evening to every one, and you your selves be in the evil day, and the approaching of it, and in the works of darkness, in the Night, swallowed up in it; how can you wish the good day, who delight in sports, delight in pleasures, delight in cove∣tousness, delight in vain jesting, whose mouths are filled with reproaches, who are wronging and killing the innocent and just; such whose tongues speak guile, and whose lips are perverse; who works iniquity, and drinks it up as an Ox drinks water, and are in the unbelief, who believes not in the Light that enlightneth every one that cometh into the world, but their Tongues are at liberty; such the way of peace you know not, nor the day: Now for you that be there, to wish another the good day, you speak that you know not; but we speak what we know and have seen, who are turned from the darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, who can say, The night is over, and the day is come; therefore such as are here doth the good day witness, that all might come to the Light, and so come to this good day, and good morning. But you that do come to this good day and good morning, you must for∣sake the evil, and the power of Satan, and the darkness, and so turned from the darkness, then you are turned from the evil day, and turned to the light; then you'l come to witness the Father and the Son, to which is said God speed. Now you that say you wish one another a good day who be in the evil day, when God crosseth your expectation, and crosseth your wills, and you cannot attain your ends, you'l say then what a sad day you have had. So you cannot wish a good day while you be in the evil day, till you be turned to the Light; for if you wish a good day with that which acts in the evil, your wishes are vain; but they that are turned to the light that enligh∣tens every one that cometh into the world, comes to see the good morning
and the good Evening, these are turned from Satans power, and Satan, to God, where he is kept out of, and appears not in the day. And so these that are here do desire that every one might come to the good day, from the evil and his day, from the Power of Satan to the light; for every one being enlightned with the Light that comes from Christ Je∣sus the Saviour of your souls; being turned to the Light, you are turned to the Father of Light, where there is no shadow of changing; being turned to the Light, they are turned to the day. Now who be from the Light, be in the darkness, under Satans power; these be in the evil day, which is evil day to them, which to them is evil day; and none come to the good morning, and to the good day, but such as come to the Light; and then these come to see the works of the Lord praise him; yea the Sun and the Moon praise him; the Stars praise him; the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon to rule the night, and these praise him, and this day is good, and the night good too, but he that is from the Light, is in the Darkness, under the power of the devil, under his power; it is his day they are in. And the Just suffers where the power of Darkness rules; but now the Just shall rule, and doth rule over the Power of Darkness, and over the evil and his day. And again, they that be in darkness and the evilday, and out of the Light not turned to it; these that be here, when foul weather comes, that crosseth them; rainy weather, say they, What an ill day is this, what a bad day is this, when such a day comes cross to their wills. And when fair Wea∣ther come, that is hot Weather, very hot, say they, What a bad day is this. And again, when Snow and cold Weather comes, What a bad cold day is this; or rainy slobby Weather, What an ill day is this. Likewise when hot sultry (as you call it) Weather comes, hot, close, misty weather, What an ill day is this, say they. And likewise Evening and Night; when great showers come in the Night, What an ill Night is this, say they; when that Snow, or Rain, great Floods, or Frost, that is in danger of taking away their Cattel, or flowing over their Corn, What an ill Night is this, say they; it they will say good Night to one another; and it they will say an ill Night presently afterwards, and say a good morning one to another, or a good day, and it they will say, What a bad day is this, or a bad morning; and here is their confusion; and it they will say a good Evening one to ano∣ther, and it they will say a bad one with the same mouth. And here they call good evil; when the Weather is cold and frost, this is good; and Snow and Rain is good, and all praiseth God, and is good; and this they call ill, an ill day, or ill night, this is their custom, shewing they are in the evil, who call the good evil; and thus they are never content, ei∣ther too hot, or too cold, too much snow or frost, or too sultry, or no rain, or too much rain; and here stand they that be out of the light, in the dis∣content,
who be in the evil day, not turned to the light, but yet remains in darkness; but such as are turned to the Light which comes from him who is the Heir of all things, which upholds all things by his word and power; these come to see how all the works of the Lord praise him, his works praise him, day and night praise him; Summer and Winter praise him; Ice and Cold, and Snow praise him; and that is the bad and evil that calls them e∣vil, and for rebuke, & reproof, & judgement. Seed-time and Harvest praise him; and all things that are created praise him: This is the Language of them who learn of him; hear him that is Heir of all things, who upholds all things by his Word and Power, by whom all things was made, and by whom all things was created for him, and to him, that above all things he might have the preheminence. And these that be here they do not call evil good, and good evil; but that which is out of the Light is in the evil; that which is out of the Light is our of the Truth; for the Light is the Truth, and the Light is the day, or leads to the day; but to these that be in the darkness, the morning to them is death. And to them that work iniquity, abhor the Light, and doth evil, the Light to them, and the Day to them is as a shadow of death, for such the Light cannot endure, for to them it is their condemnation. And to you this is the Word of the Lord God, which shall answer the Light in every ones conscience, for from the Word the Light comes, and the entrance of the Word giveth Light. And here all may see who are turned to the Light, the good Day, the good Morning, and the Night, which God made, who saw it was good; and the evil day who is out of Truth, the evil and his day is out of Truth, where the works are done that are not good; but the Lord is bringing all these things to an end; that which is evil is not good; that which is good is not evil: Now that which is evil comes to be condemned with the Light that is good, and shut forth; Glory be to the Lord God of life for ever. And this is for all the world, which stumbles at the things before men∣tioned, to read your selves, and see in which day you are, and all to take heed to the Light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-star arise in their hearts, that every one may come to put a difference between the precious and the vile; the clean and the unclean; for that which is out of the Light is unclean and prophane, and not precious; for being turned to the Light, turned to the Word, that is a Sword, that puts a differ∣ence between the precious and the vile, where the precious inherits the precious promises. Therefore every one of you being enlightned with a Light that comes from Christ, who lighteth every one that cometh into the world, every one of you being turned to the light that cometh from Christ, with the Light you are turned to him who is the way to the Father, out of the world, from the evil and its day; but if you hate the Light, this is your condemnation: This is the VVord of the Lord God.
He that saith he wishes a good Morning and a good day to people, and hates the Light, that's dissimulation; for he that hates light, hates the good day, & hates the good Night; so he that wishes a good day, or good morning to another, and hates Light, is in hypocrisie, and his wishes are vain. A∣gain, he that wishes a good night and a good day, and saith an ill night, and an ill day, knoweth not that which the Lord hath made to be good, he calleth that which God hath made evill, and seeth not himselfe to be in the evil day, and evil night, the night of darkness. And again, he that saith, what an ill morning and ill day it is, and what an ill evening and ill night is this, because the season crosseth him, who doth not discern the times and seasons that be in the Fathers hand, and knows not him who makes all things good; so he that wisheth a good day, and good night, a good morn∣ing, it with the same saith, it is an ill morning or ill day, or ill night, he it is that is ill, and calls evill good, and his wishes are vain, and the night is good, and the morning is good, and the day is good, and times and sea∣sons are in his Fathers hand; these that be here are out of the evil day and darkness, in that which is good, which judgeth and condemneth the other, and burns it up, which calls evil good, & good evil; Here all may see the e∣vil day, and the good day, that which is bad the world calls good; that time and season which is seasonable, is unseasonable to the wicked; for times and seasons be in the fathers hands, which be good, them that be in the life of God see them good, which times and seasons the wicked calls evil, (and that is the ev) and the evil is not the good, the discontent which hath not  its lsson to be content, and is blind, and seeth not the times and  the Fathers hand, and that is for Judgment, that is the eye must be put out, that is the eye Christ comes to put out, that is the evil eye.
The Worlds hypocriticall Saluta∣tions being out of the truth are condemned with the truth THe customs, and manners, and fashions of the world which is practised a∣mongst people in the world, which is vaine, when they meet one with another, they will say how do you Sir, doff the hat, scrape a leg, make a courchy, I am glad to see you well, your servant, your servant my Lord, (or Sir) or Mistress, and when they are past them, with the same tongue wish evil to them, speak evil of them, wish hurt to them, or to her, and say he is so, (and so) or curse him, or wish that he were hanged, (or kill, or do him a mischief) yet when he meets him, or she meets her: A woman meets another, they bow one to another, or if men meets, the hats bow, they are one anothers servants, (and your humble servant) and their service, and then when they are past one another, wishes wickedness one to another, and laugh at one another behind their backs, and this is a custome that is evil, among men and women, which ought not to be, and is to be rebuked, and reproved, (they profess love and friendship to one another, with the same mouth wish ill one to another, and one destroy another, this hath been an evil custome among men, and women, who when they meet together, flatter one another, and say they are one a∣nothers servants, and profess humility one to another, and when one is gone from the other, envy one another, and lay a plot to do him mischief, and do wickedness to one another; this is, and hath been a bad thing, among people, (and is to be re∣proved) and these Salutations are vain, and not to be observed, but denied, and to be judged, that plainness, and truth, and uprightness, and honesty may come to rule in people, and single heartedness, and the love indeed, which is more then words, (and this humility is feigned, and this is a flattering one another in the presence, and a backbiting one another, behind one anothers backs; this is to be judged and condemned, that the witness of God in all may arise, that leads to truth in the inward parts.
The End.
