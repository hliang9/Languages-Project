THE FARMERS HEIR. Or the Countrey-man wooing his Mistriss, To be Sung with its own pleasant Air. NOt long ago, it chanced so, abroad as I was walking And there I spy'd two Lovers true, the one with the other talking. The Youth he said unto the Maid, wilt thou grant me my pleasure, And I'le give thee a double Fee, and joys above all measure. But the Maid she would not condescend for fear of late Repentance; She saw nothing but Gravel and Sand, and all things out of sentence: Its neither for thy Gold nor thy Gear, but its for thy handsome Carriage; And since thou art such a pretty Girl, I will joyn with thee in Marriage. Thy Eyes are like the Stars above, they having such a luster; If I had the World at my command I would make the Venus Sister. Thy Cheeks are like the Crimson Rose. and thy Lips like the ripesome Berry; There's nothing that does me so much reâˆ£joyce as the fight of my own Deary. Then she hearing her  o ighly steem'd she yielded to his wishes, And there they did them both combine in joys and earthly blisses. Both hand in hand the two did walk, and they walked both together, And he play'd her such a handsome tck, as true Lovers do to each other. FINIS.
