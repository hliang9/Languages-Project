Friday the 25 of July. 1651. A LETTER FROM THE Lord General, Dated the One and twentieth of July, 1651 was this day Read; viz. FOR THE Right Honorable William Lenthal Esq; Speaker of the Parliament of the Common-wealth of England. SIR, AFter our waiting upon the Lord, and not knowing what course to take for in∣deed we know nothing but what God pleaseth to teach us) of his great mercy, we were directed to send a Party to get us a
Landing by our Boats, whilest we marched towards Glascow. On Thursday morning last Col. Overton with about Fourteen hun∣dred Foot, and some Horse and Dragoons, landed at the North Ferry in Fife: We with the Army lying neer to the Enemy (a small River parted us and them) and we having Consultations to attempt the Enemy with∣in his Fortifications; but the Lord was not pleased to give way to that Counsel, purpo∣sing a better way for us. The Major General marched on Thurs∣day night with two Regiments of Horse, and two Regiments of Foot, for better se∣curing the Place, and to attempt upon the Enemy as opportunity should serve: He getting over, and finding a considerable Body of the Enemy there (who would probably have beaten our men from the place, if he had not come) drew out and fought them, He being two Regiments of Horse, and about Four hundred of Horse and Dra∣goons more, and three Regiments of Foot; the Enemy five Regiments of Foot, and about four or five Regiments of Horse; they
came to a close Charge, and in the end total∣ly Routed the Enemy, Have taken about Forty or fifty Colours, killed neer Two thousand, some say more; have taken Sir Iohn Brown (their Major General, who com∣manded in chief) and other Colonels and considerable Officers killed and taken, and about Five or Six hundred Prisoners. The Enemy is removed from their Ground with their whole Army, but whether we cer∣tainly know not. This is an unspeakable Mercy, I trust the Lord will follow it until he hath per∣fected Peace and Truth: We can truly say, we were gone as far as we could in our Counsel and Action, and we did say one to another, We know not what to do. Wherefore it is Sealed upon our Hearts, That this as all the rest, is from the Lords goodness, and not from man. I hope it becometh me to pray, That we may walk humbly and self∣denyingly before the Lord, and believingly also, That you whom we serve (as the Authority over us, may do the Work com∣mitted to you, with Uprightness and Faith∣fulness,
and throughly as to the Lord, That you may not suffer any thing to remain, that offends the eyes of his Jealousie, That common wealth may more and more be sought, and Justice done impartially. For the Eyes of the Lord run too and fro, and as he findes out his Enemies here, to be avenged on them; so will he not spare them for whom he doth good, if by his loving kindness they become not good. I shall take the humble boldness to represent this Engagement of Davids in the 119. Psalm, the 134 Verse, Deliver me from the op∣pression of man, so will I keep thy Precepts. I take leave and rest Sir Your most humble Servant O. Cromwel. Lithgow, July 21. 1651.
THe Carriage of the Major Ge∣neral, as in all other things, so in this, is worthy of your taking notice of; as also Colonel Okey, Colonel Overton, Colonel Daniel, Colonel West, Colonel Lidcot, Colonel Syber, and the rest of the Officers.
Friday, the 25th of July, 1651. ORdered by the Parliament, That upon the next Lords day the Ministers in all the Congrega∣tions, within the City of London and late Lines of Communication, and weekly Bills of Mortality, do render Thanks to Almighty God for his wonderful Mercy in the great success given to the Parliaments Forces in Scotland, against the Enemy there, upon the last Lords day, being the 20th day of July in∣stant, and implore the continuance of Gods blessing upon the Proceedings of the Forces of this Common∣wealth there, and the perfecting of his own Work to his Praise.
