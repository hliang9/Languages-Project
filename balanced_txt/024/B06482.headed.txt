THE MEMORIAL OF THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR TO HIS MAJESTY. SIR, THe under-written Ambassador of the States General of the United Netherlands, Your good Friends and Allies, having had the honour of several Audiences with Your Majesty, and therein made known to You such Orders as he hath from time to time received from his Masters, upon occasion of, and concerning divers Affairs, and especially these following: To wit, Seing it is understood and perceived, that Vessels of War are fitting and preparing on both sides, which if they go forth to Sea and meet there together, might by some mis∣understanding, fall foul upon one another; Your Majesty
would therefore be pleased to keep back Your Fleet, and  suffer it to go to Sea; as their Lordships offer on their p to do; the whole intent and design tending only to th safety of both parties, and the prevention of the foresai sinister encounters. Moreover, whereas their Lordships have been informed that Captain Holmes, with the Vessels under his command hath now again (as heretofore) done very great and enor∣mous injuries to the Netherlandish Company of the Wes Indies, by taking divers of their Vessels upon the Coast o Africk, as also by making himself Master of some Place and Forts belonging unto them, and namely amongst othe of Capo Verde, &c. which is directly contrary, not onl to the Treaty last concluded between Your Majesty and th States of the United Provinces, but also to mutual amit and good neighbourhood: The said Ambassador did there∣fore, in the name of his Superiors, demand restitution o the same, and that reparation might be made of the damage and interests which the said Company and other Subject of their Lordships who were concerned, have suffered there∣by; as also, that the like proceedings and violences might be prevented for the future by an express Order. In the third place, that their Lordships, being from day to day confirmed by certain Intelligence coming from that Coast, that the foresaid action of Captain Holmes had not only been effected in the manner above-specified, but also that he was intended to carry on his design further, by making incursions and seising upon all the Coast, and that for his better success therein, he expected a notable supply of Ships from England, as the whole matter may be proved by the testimony and depositions of credible per∣sons
newly come from thence: Which actions being with∣out right, reason and equity, and which consequently can∣not be endured, nor looked upon with a good eye, Your Ma∣jesty was entreated that it might be Your good Pleasure to command as well the said Captain Holmes, as others who were in that engagement, or are held to have been employ∣ed therein, not only to restore the foresaid Forts and Ves∣sels so taken, and to repair the damages thereby suffered (as reason requires) but also that the Ships which by report are now ready to set Sail, or which may be fitting for that end, may, by Your Majesties express Command, be prohi∣bited and charged not to do or cause any other injury or damage to the said Company; or to any other the Subjects of the United Provinces. Fourthly, Forasmuch as the poor and afflicted reformed Churches in the vallies of Piedmont have represented, that after the agreement made with his Royal Highness the Duke of Savoy some while since, they are again overwhelmed and ruined by exactions and charges required of them to defray the expenses of the Army which the said Duke had commanded against them, which charges amounted to so high a sum, that it was impossible for them to make it up, for the reasons more at large alledged in their Remon∣strance; Therefore they have desired the intercession of the States General with Your Majesty, that Your Ambas∣sador in the Court of France may have order to procure from his most Christian Majesty (as being Mediator be∣tween his said Royal Highness and them) as much favour and comfort to those poor afflicted Churches as can possibly by any means be obtained. And finally, considering that the Vessels coming from the United Provinces into the Rivers, Streams and Roads
of this Kingdom, are stopped there under pretence that there be Persons and Commodities on board which come from places infected with the Plague, or at least suspected to be so, by which means the freedom of Trade and Passage is obstructed and disturbed, to the great prejudice of the inhabitants of both Nations: The said Ambassador there∣fore insisted thereupon, that the same might be remedied, or at least that the strictness of those Orders might be miti∣gated in such measure as in reason shall be found conveni∣ent; And that the rather, because, by the mercy of God, all the Provinces in general are not infected with the Contagion. To all that is abovesaid, Your Majesty hath been pleased to answer in effect; to wit, upon the first point, touching keeping of the Fleet from going to Sea, That the numbers which were fitted and prepared on Your Majesties side being no way extraordinary, but only for common and customary use, and without design of bringing any damage or incon∣venience upon the inhabitants of the United Provinces, the said Vessels could not be kept from going to Sea, be∣cause Your Majesties Honour was engaged therein; Never∣theless, that You would give such Orders to the Chief Com∣mander of Your said Fleet, that their Lordships shall have no cause to apprehend any sinister encounters from it. As to the second, touching the action of Captain Holmes; Your Majesty thought good to answer thereunto, That You had received no information of it, and that having given no Order for his so doing, You would cause reparati∣on to be made, if the matter proved to be true, and that the said Captain Holmes should be punished according as the case should require: Nevertheless adding thereunto afterwards at another Audience, that the West-India
Company had likewise done much damage to Your Majesties Subjects upon the said Coast, pretending to be Masters thereof to themselves alone; which thing ought to be con∣sidered also in its proper season, judging it unreasonable and unjust that the Trade of the English upon that Coast should continually be disturbed and hindred. And as to the third, Your Majesty was pleased to say as before, That You had received no information of Holmes his actions in those parts; and for so much as concerned the Ships which are ready to set Sail towards the Coast of Africk, that they were not in a condition to make any attempt there, being only Merchant-men, unto which there was added but one Man of War for their Convoy. For what regards the poor Piemontoies, That You were sensibly touched with the miserable condition of those Churches and People, and for that reason Your Majesty had already given Order to Your Ambassador in France to con∣tribute unto their relief and comfort in Your Name; But for∣asmuch as at present there occur some new difficulties con∣cerning the said Churches, Your Majesty would advise more particularly thereupon. And lastly, concerning the Merchants Ships which come from the United Provinces into this Kingdom, and are stopped without permission to Land any where, because they are suspected to come from some place infected with the sickness, there being no distinction made between Pro∣vinces and Cities really afflicted with the said Conta∣gion, and those which are not so at all; That Your Maje∣sty having an extraordinary apprehension of that disease, had great reason to use all possible precaution against it;
Notwithstanding, that the business should also be thought upon more fully. All which points abovesaid having been repeated by the said Ambassador at his last Audience, and instance there∣upon made, that according to their Lordships desires Your Majesty would be pleased to explain Your Self in Writing, to put the minds of his Superiors out of perplexity and dis∣quiet; and Your Majesty having to that purpose desired, that all should be comprised in a Memorial for an Answer to be given thereunto in Writing: The said Memorial (May it please Your Majesty) is here most humbly pre∣sented, with like prayer, that such Order may be taken therein, as that by a favourable answer (which the said Ambassador expects from Your Majesty) he may be enabled to give his Masters content. M. Van-Gogh. From Chelsey, July 21/31 1664.
HIS MAJESTIES ANSWER To the fore-going MEMORIAL. THe Ambassador of the United Provinces having so particular∣ly set down the Answers he re∣ceived from Us in his several Audiences to his particular de∣mands; albeit We think he may well acquiesce with the same, yet since he hath thought fit by his Memorial, to desire an Answer in writing, We are very well pleased to satisfie him herein, that the States General may see the sincerity of Our proceedings towards them. Concerning the preparations and provision of Ves∣sels of War, it is notoriously known; that in the be∣ginning of this year We gave order for the providing a less guard of Ships for the Summer, then hath been set out any year since our happy Restoration for that season, believing Our Self to be in so good Intelligence with all Our Neighbours▪ that We might well
charge; when Our Parliament, upon the cry of the whole Nation, with some earnestness pressed Us to take an extraordinary way to repair Our people, for the many and daily injuries they sustained from the Subjects of the United Provinces by depredations at Sea, in other places as well as in the East-Indies, in which there were some circumstances of that presumption, in declaring their Dominion and inhibiting of Commerce against the Law of Nations, as all Princes are equally concerned therein with Us; We made no other answer to Our Parliament, then that We made no doubt but that Our good Allies, the States of the United Provinces, to whom in truth the injuries sustained could not reaso∣nably (We thought) be imputed, would cause justice to be done; in order to which, We would appoint Our Minister residing there to make a representation and complaint. For which temper and moderation (when it may be, another resolution, considering the nature of the provocations, would have been more agreeable to the desires of Our Parliament) We expected the thanks of Our good Neighbours, when on the contrary they no sooner received advice of this Answer returned by Us, then in a very extraordinary manner they gave direction for the present setting out of a very great num∣ber of Ships of War, without any other visible cause then to manifest to the world how much they defied Us and Our Parliament. Upon all which, as We should have been thought to have had very little fore∣sight for our Honour or Interest, if We had not pre∣pared a considerable Fleet for Our defence, (the charge and expence whereof We would have been very glad to have prevented) so the same being prepared, it will be thought a very strange proposition▪ that it be
kept within the Ports; and it will be found by their demeanour, that their Instructions are not to do any in∣jury to Our Neighbours and Friends, but to defend Our Self, Our Dominions and Our Subjects from receiving injuries from Our enemies. Nor in truth can we believe or imagine, that the United Provinces (from whom We have deserved well, and with whom We are ready to maintain a fast friendship, to which many other con∣siderations, besides that great one of the Protestant Religion, should dispose both of Us) will deny to do Us justice upon Our reasonable demands, or that they will ever sacrifice the Peace of their Country for the support of the miscarriages of particular persons, or a particular Company, who We find by experience more considers their own profit and interest, then the honour or safety of the Government under which they live; which the States General will well weigh and consider. As We did with great frankness, and as an everlast∣ing manifestation of Our affection and kindness, con∣clude the late Treaty with the United Provinces, by which many very memorable discourtesies and injuries to Our Self and Our people, and particularly that of Amboyna, were put in oblivion; So We have most ex∣actly observed every Article on Our part, and have no sooner been moved in any particular, in which the Sub∣jects of the United Provinces have been grieved, then We have given order for their redress, in the most ex∣pedite way, without putting them to those formalities which are usual in Courts of Justice: whereas We are very sory to say, that upon all the complaints made at the Hague by Our Minister, in which the matter of Fact hath been most notorious and convincing, and the Right
most apparent, redress hath not been given to any one and such delayes used in all, as are upon the matter, and in the consequence of it, a plain denial of Justice, which brings every day great complaints to Us from Our Sub∣jects of all parts: Notwithstanding all which, We have not to this day granted one Letter of Mart upon the Subjects of the United Provinces. Concerning Captain Holmes, We have with great sincerity assured the Ambassador, that he had no Com∣mission to take Capo Verde, nor any other place belong∣ing to the Dutch, or to do any Act of Hostility upon any of the Subjects of the United Provinces, that was not for the defence of Our Subjects and their Trade in∣to those parts: And we cannot but expect, that this Our free Declaration should find more credit with Our Allies, then any informations or examinations of Ma∣riners and Sea-men, who seldom know what they in∣form. We expect the said Captain Holmes his arrival here every day, and will then, upon due enquiry into all that he hath done, determine what is just. The Ships at present designed for those parts are Ships of Trade, and have neither power nor will to wrong the Subjects of the United Provinces. But we are very heartily sor∣ry to hear, not from general rumour, or the loose discour∣ses of hear-sayes, but from the pregnant evidence and full information of Our Governour of Our Fort of Cor∣mantine, That about the end of January last, the Commanders of the Ships belonging to the Dutch West-India Company, after many assaults upon Our Mer∣chants Ships in those Seas, and forbidding and restrain∣ing them from Trade, did stir up and hire the King of Fantine to assault and surprize that Our Castle of Cor∣mantine,
and to put the same into their hands for the price of sixty Bendys, whereof one half was payd down by the said Dutch Commanders, with this condition likewise, that the said Natives should enjoy to them∣selves all the plunder of that Our said Castle. In pur∣suance of which infamous Contract, and the better to enable them to perform the same, the Dutch Com∣manders supplied the said King of Fantine with a good quantity of Muskets, Powder and Cartages; whereof Our Commander having notice, by the blessing of God surprized the same: which it may be is one of those Acts of Hostility whereof mention is made in this Me∣morial, We having no notice of any other. Two Men of War, belonging to the Dutch Company, came from the Mina to Cape Coast to attend this enterprize at the time appointed, and accordingly the King of Fan∣tine upon the fifth day of February last came with five hundred men in hope to have surprized Our Castle; but finding himself discovered, and forced ro retire with some loss, he advanced again the next day with a Body of three thousand men, and continued a sharp fight with Our men for the space of four hours, after which time he was beaten off with great loss, and hath since with shame and sorrow acknowledged his breach of faith to∣wards Us, and declared the motives and Contract afore∣said; the Dutch Ships at the same time driving a small Ship belonging to Our Merchants under the command of Captain Borthwick into Our Port Inashange, anchored by him, hindred all the Canoes from coming on board him, and took his Boat and five men, which they would not restore till they found their other enterprize had miscarried. We cannot in any degree doubt that the States of the United Provinces will manifest their
detestation of this perfidious design, and cause exem¦plary Justice to be done upon the Persons guilty of it, which We expect and require; and that instead of send∣ing Ships of War to justifie these unwarrantable and scandalous proceedings, (which would be attended with ill effects, and would insensibly produce a War between the two Nations, which we desire to prevent) their Wisdoms will reprehend and warn their West-India Company, that they hereafter forbear those outrages, and that they do not presume under the stile of Mer∣chants to usurp the Prerogative of Princes, and assume such a Dominion to themselves, as if it were in truth vested in them, would not warrant them to inhibit Traffique and Commerce with their Neighbours, but must incense all Christian Princes against their pre∣sumption. Concerning the Reformed Churches in the valleys o Piedmont, towards whom We have expressed Our com∣passion and charity in a contribution since Our happy Restoration, as We will be alwayes ready to relieve and protect the afflicted state of any Protestant Churches to Our Power; We being not fully informed of their con∣dition, or the grounds of their late sufferings, know not what more to do, then to desire the most Christi∣an King to use his mediation, which We doubt not but he will do upon the desire of Our Ambassador in Ou name, and acccording to Our directions. We are exceedingly afflicted for those places withi the Dominions of the United Provinces which are  present infected with the Plague, and do heartily pray to God that he will speedily withdraw that his Visita∣tion from them, and in the mean time do in a great degree
suffer with them, by the suspending that Traffique and Commerce which is so much for the good of both Nati∣ons: But it cannot be expected or desired, that We will neglect or decline that provident care of Our People which is due to them, in using all possible means to pre∣serve them from that Contagion, which cannot be done without such restraints, which are for the present with great loss and damage to both People, and to which We hope the goodness of God will shortly put a period, by making the correspondence as safe and wholsome as it hath been, and restoring perfect health to the places now infected, as well as to their Neighbours, who can∣not but in a degree suffer with them, though they are not under the same calamity. We having now complyed with the Ambassadors de∣sires, in giving this particular Answer in writing to his Memorial, and to all that he hath proposed to Us, We make no question but he will faithfully transmit the same to Our good Friends and Allies the United Pro∣vinces; and We desire him the said Ambassador to assure them, that We are so firmly resolved to maintain a firm Amity and Friendship with them, that a War (by the blessing of God) cannot fall out between Us, except they depart from all Rules of Justice, and suffer their Subjects to involve them in a War to support the wrong they do their Neighbours against all Right; which we are most confident they will never be induced to do, and which mischief (of which no man can foresee the end) their great Wisdoms will prevent. CHARLES R. By His Majesties Command,
