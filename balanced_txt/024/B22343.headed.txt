Die Veneris, 21. Iunii. 1644. FOrasmuch as the charge of conducting the Forces under the Command of Sir Thomas Middleton into Wales, is very great, and the passage difficult, by reason of the Powerful∣nesse and strength of the Enemy in the Coun∣ties, through which the said Forces are to passe. And for that there is no provision made for maintenance of the said Forces untill they can arrive in Wales, but by what monies may be raised by Subscriptions upon an Ordinance of Parliament granted him for that purpose. The Commons Assembled in Parliament, taking the same into consideration, and being informed of very good service that these Forces have lately done, neer Dudley Castle, Have this day ordered, that the said Subscrip∣tions be againe recommended to those Parishes and per∣sons, that have done nothing in the furtherance of the said Service▪ by the Ministers and Churchwardens, and other well-affected persons of each Parish, and that such persons as have, or shall Subscribe anything for the said Service, do forthwith pay the same to the Treasurers at Grocers Hall, appointed to receive it. Henry Elsynge, Cler. Parl. D. Com.
