❧ A TREATISE OF the travailes of Noah into Europe, containing the first inhabitation and peopling thereof. TO begin vvith the genealogie of Dardanus (the first founder and erecter of the citie of Troy) it is requisite that we take for our cheefest guide therein the first prince and Patriarch of the world, called Noe, surnamed Gallus; following herein most especially, the chronicle of that au∣thenticke writer, Berosus the Chaldean: who indeed of all others most accordeth with the writings and holy workes of Moyses in the old Testament; for as much as the Chal∣deans generally addicted themselves to letters: unto which they were allured and persuaded by Noe, shewing them the use of Historie, and therein the true particulars of the creation of the world, untill that very time wherein they then lived; which also Noe himselfe learned and was
instructed in by his father Lamech, who likewise received his knowledge from his grandfather the Prophet Enoch, before hee was transported into the heavenly Paradice: and this Enoch had it by tradition from the first father A∣dam, who was possest therewith by divine instinct and ho∣ly inspiration. Let us now therefore attend what this Be∣rosus the Chaldaean will deliver unto us, being a most re∣nowned, auncient, and grave author, who flourished not long before the times of Alexander the Great; and un∣to whom (as Plinie in his Naturall hystorie reporteth) the Athenians for his great wisdome and eloquence, erected in their universitie a most stately and gorgeous statue to his owne shape and similitude, whose tongue they guil∣ded over with most pure and resplendent gold. This Bero∣sus wee will in this Treatise much relie upon, adjoyning withall unto his authoritie other authors of great worth, learning, and antiquitie. Noe (according to S. Ierome in his interpretations of Hebrew words) signifieth as much as resting or easing of a mans selfe; and he was the sonne of Lamech, which signi∣fieth humilitie. This Noe by the descriptions of old writers was taken in those daies to be a Giant, in respect of his ex∣traordinarie stature, proportion, and corpulencie: and he was about the age (as Moyses also in the sixt chapter of Genesis affirmeth) of five hundred yeares, when he begat of his vile Ty (otherwise called Aretia) these his three first sonnes, Se, which interpreted, signifies famous, o∣therwise called Melchisedech: cham the second (though Berosus affirme him to bee the youngest) which signifies subtiltie or craft: and Iaphet, which signifies libertie or freedome: with these his three sonnes, Noe and his familie
lived in a citie called Enos, which was the first citie in the world, and was built by Cain the sonne of Adam, at the foot of the mountaine Libanus in the land of Syria, and in the particular province of Phoenicia, not far from the famous citie of Ierusalem, situated in the holy land. In this citie of Enos, and in many others thereabouts, inhabited and lived many most deformed, fierce, and ter∣rible giants, who by reason of their unmatchable strength and indomitable powerfulnesse, ruled and overswaied all those people thereabouts at their pleasure, committing many odious and ungodly deeds, and living a most disso∣lute and vicious life, engorging their luxurious appetites with surfets of adulterie and libidinous conversation, as void of shame, the law of nature, and the feare of God. In these times many very learned Astronomers and wise Soothsaiers gave out propheticall divinations of the suddaine approching destruction of the universall world, which their forewarning prognostications they engraved and cut forth in pillars of marble and stonie monuments, to signifie thereby unto the world, their knowledge of such future and sure happening accidents. All this notwith∣standing, these obstinat and heart-hardened Giants per∣severed in their impious and detestable practises, tyranni∣zing and oppressing without all measure, addicting them∣selves to the finding out of weapons, shields, and other warlick accoustrements, as also to the making of tents, pa∣vilions, and such like expedient necessaries for the field: wholly excluding all thoughts of any alteration or chaunge to ensue: onely the good giant Noe, among all the rest, feared God, and was obedient to his lawes, with all the rest of his familie and houshold, which was Titea
his wife, Sem, Cham, and Iaphet, their children, and Pando∣ra, Noela, & Noegla, their wives: all which, Noe instructed in modestie and good manners, and in the reverence and feare of their soveraign Creator. He therefore, as well by divine commandement, as by the science of Astronomie, by which he gathered the overthrow and confusion of the world, began to frame and fashion that huge ship or Ark, which we so often read of in holy scriptures, & which was appointed from above to be the meanes of the salvation and preservation of humane kind. Noe, when hee saw this generall inundation to approch and shew it selfe, convei∣ed him and his familie into this Arke, when presently all the world, and all things else therein (this excepted) were overwhelmed and subverted under the raging furie of this so strange and all-devouring deluge: and this was perfor∣med on the eighteenth day of Aprill, in the six hundred yeare of the age of Noe. And hetherto was accounted the first age of the world, according as Philo the Iew in his computations affirmeth. The world thus universally drowned and kept downe under the all-subduing power of the waters (Noe and his familie excepted) in the end they began againe to sinke backe and retire into the earth, which when Noe percea∣ved (his Arke then resting on the top of the high hill Gor∣dicus in Armenia) by the will and commaundement of God, he with the rest (which were seven) came out of his ship, and descended downe unto the new-dried land: which was performed eight hundred thirtie three yeares before the foundation of Troy, & before the incarnation of Christ two thousand three hundred and seventeene yeares. Noe then seeing himselfe thus left the sole King,
Monarch, Emperour, Patriarke, Lord, and Maister of the whole universall land, remained wonderously astonied at this so straunge and sence amazing accident: and passing along the land, he found on a plaine a faire pillar of mar∣ble, whereon he carefully engraved and set downe the de∣luge and generall inundation of the world in the form of an hystoricall discourse: & this stone (as it is reported) is called at this day by the inhabitants thereabouts, Myri-Adam, which interpreted, signifies the issue of Noe; and it standeth in the countrey of Armenia, beeing a great province in Asia the great, which affronteth towards the East the Hyrcanian sea, towards the South lies Mesopo∣tamia, towards the North Colchos and Albania, and towards the West, Cappadocia; and through the midst of it runne the two famous rivers, Tigris and Euphrates, of all which countries, hereafter in this hystorie more at large shall be spoken. It is written, That Noe begat of his wife Tytea after the floud, thirtie children, viZ. Tuyscon the Giant, Prometheus, Iupetus, Macrus, and the sixteen Titans which were all Giants: also Cranus, Granaus, Oceanus, and Tipheus; and of daughters, Araxa surnamed the Great, Regina, Pandora, Crana, and Thetis: some authours doe alleadge more, but for brevities sake wee will not fur∣ther contend with others opinions. Noe thus living in Ar∣menia, instructed these his children in the knowledge of sacred Theologie, and in rites belonging to religion and holy sacrifices, as also in the understanding of human ma∣ners and secresies of Nature, of which hee himselfe had composed many bookes, which afterward the priests and churchmen of Scythia and Armenia, preserved and kept a great regard and reverence. For this cause he was cal∣led
among the Scythians Ogyges Saga, which interpreted from the Scythian language, signifies as much as, Great Patriarke, soveraigne Priest, and mightie Sacrificer. And this Berosus affirmeth, saying: Primum itaque dixerunt O∣gygam Sagam,Berosus. id est, Illustrem sacrorum Pontificem Noam: he also taught and instructed them the knowledge of the course of the planets, and devided the yeare into twelve months, according to the course and circumference of the Moone: he also by his studie of Astronomie and ob∣servance of the coelestiall motions, could prognosticat of the alterations of weather in the yeare succeeding: for which causes the Scythians and Armenians very highly honoured him, thinking him to pertake of the divine na∣ture and supernall knowledge, and therefore called him Olybama & Arsa, which is as much as to say, the Heaven, and the Sunne: and they afterward also built and named many great citties in his name and of his wife Titea, so much were they honoured for their vertues and godly conversation. He further taught those people the use of agriculture and tillage of the ground, and also the finding out of the use of the grape, and the manner to plant vines and other necessaries for their more easie living, wherup∣on hee was entearmed also Ianus, which in the Scythian tongue, signifies the giver of wine. But as he was the first that found out the use thereof, so was hee the first that felt the power and vertue of it, who not being able to endure the fume and mightie strength of the operation thereof, in a great feast wherto he had envited many of his friends, fell extreamely drunke, and so overcome therewith, as he lay sencelesly sleeping in unseemely manner amid these his guests and friends so envited: such was the furie of
that new-found drinke. Among all the sonnes of Noe, Cham was the least in his fathers favor, who also by reason of his Magicke art (wher∣in he had great knowledge) was called Zoroast, who wholly gave himselfe over unto all incivilitie and rude behaviors, following the abhominations and vices of those horri∣ble giants before the floud: he, as hating his owne father, for that he saw himselfe least beloved of him, as he saw him thus lying drunke (using some charmes of enchantment) tooke now the time of revenge, and by his Magick so be∣witched his father in those places of generation, that hee disabled him ever after to have the use of women, or to get more children: for these and other such his detesta∣ble impieties, hee incurred the wrath and displeasure of God, in most greevous manner, and was afterward bani∣shed from his father; who afflicted him with no more pu∣nishment therein for such his unnaturall deed so com∣mitted. Humane kind through the succession of time, so much encreased and multiplied, that they were now enforced to seeke out some new habitations and places of abode: whereupon the good Patriarke Noe, surnamed Ianus, be∣gan to exhort the princes and cheefe of his familie, to put themselves in search for other countries and places of re∣sidence, and there to build and erect villages and citties, for the societie of humane conversation: and he thus al∣lotted unto them their regions and quarters, where to po∣pulat and inhabit. To Sem, surnamed Melchisedech, he appointed Asia the great, which in it selfe containes the halfe of the world: and hee had with him in his companie xxv. Rulers of his familie. Hee afterwards built the cittie
of Salem, now called Ierusalem, and hee lived even untill the time of Abraham. Vnto Iaphet his brother was allotted Europe, and he had with him foureteene rulers of his ge∣neration: and unto these two, Noe bequeathd his blessing most amply, according as the scripture maketh mention: As for Cham, although he was out of grace with his fa∣ther, yet had hee his inheritage also allowed unto him, which was the other third part of the world, as hereafter shall be farther spoken of. Frier Iohn Annius of Viterbe, the expositor of our author Berosus, doth recite, that Philo the Iew (another very ancient author) doth write, That in the hundred year after the deluge, Noe to shew and instruct his children in Cosmographie, went upon the mountaines which over∣looke the Ponticke sea (part of which is now called Mare Mediterraneum) and there shewed unto his sonne Sem all the Asiaticke seas, from the floud Tanais in Tartaria un∣to the river Nilus in Aegypt: unto Cham he shewed all the rivers issuing from the seas of Affrica, and from thence through Aegypt to the streights of Gybraltar: and to Ia∣phet all the rivers and flouds of Europe, passing from those streights, through Spaine, Fraunce, and Italie, and those countries round about; into which countrey of Italie Noe also afterward arrived, and left behind him certaine of his people in that part of the country where Rome was long after built, which was eight hundred yeares after the floud: from thence he passed unto the coasts of Greece, and entred into the straights leading to Constantinople, by the sea called Mare Major, and so againe to the flouds of Tanais in Tartaria, from whence he first set forth. And it is to bee noted, That as hee passed through all those
countries, he alwaies left people behind him to inhabit and encrease in those countries, destributing unto every number certaine quarters to remaine in: and after this time, in short space many countries were againe reinha∣bited and peopled afresh, which since the floud were de∣solat, and lay naked and depopulat. About the one and twentieth yeare of this his returne from the above written voyage, Noe began to divide king∣domes, & also to erect monarchies in the world: of which the first was the monarchie of Babylon, over the which, Nembroth the Giant, the sonne of his nephew Cus, who was the sonne of Cham, was first of all established, in the hundred and one and thirtieth year after the inundation; and hee was called the first Saturne or king over the Baby∣lonians and Assyrians, who afterward in a faire Campania called Sennaar, laid the foundation, and erected the great tower and citie of Babell, which he had caused to be built even to the height of the highest mountaines, but after by the confusion of languages it was given over and left unfinished. Nembroth after this lived in peace and tran∣quilitie 56 yeares. Not many years after the setting up of the monarchie of Babylon, Noe divided foure particular kingdomes in Europe, viz. the kingdome of Italie, Spain, Fraunce, and of Almaigne: for in Italie raigned Comerus Gallus, the eldest sonne of Iaphet: in Spaine ruled Tuball (called also Iuball) the fifteenth sonne of Iaphet: in Fraunce Samothes (surnamed Dis) Iaphets fourth sonne: and over Almaign, (now called Germanie) governed the Giant Tuyscon, one of the sonnes of Noe. And so likewise in many other places of the world were severall governements and
kingdomes then erected, which now to recite, were tedi∣ous and impertinent to our purpose; & every one of them a long time kept and were contented with their quarters so allotted unto them, and imposed lawes and edicts unto their people, and they called the countrey after their own name, as also many mountaines, rivers, and townes were so entearmed, to the end, that all succeeding posteritie might know by what meanes and by whome such citties and other monuments receaved their first ground and foundation. After these kingdomes and governements erected, and the earth now againe well peopled, Noe now underta∣keth his second voiage into Europe, leaving Sabatius Saga his nephew, and brother to Nembroth king of Babylon, to governe and commaund over the countrey of Arme∣nia, from whence hee now departeth with purpose to visit his children, and to know of their estates. And this Saba∣tius Saga (called also Saturne) had all the countrey even unto the land of Bactria, lying towards India (at this day called Tartaria) under his rule and authoritie. These things at home thus established, Noe (surnamed Ianus) with his wife Titea, and many multitudes of people be∣sides, began his voyage (which was eight score and nine yeares after the floud, and in the eight and thirtieth yeare of the raigne of Nembroth) towards Hyrcania, which he then peopled, and called them after his owne name Ianij. From thence he came to Mesopotamia, where also he left behind him many people to inhabit: and from thence he attained the countrey called Arabia Foelix, where he ere∣cted two citties, the one called Noa, the other Ianinea, furnishing them with inhabitants: after, hee passed from
thence, and came into Affrica, which part of the world hee first assigned unto the governement and soveraigne∣tie of his second sonne Cham, but at that time there ruled Triton the sonne of Saba, which was the son of Cus, the eldest sonne of the same Cham. This Triton receaved Noe and his companie with great joy and gladnesse of hart, and he staied there some halfe a year, in which time Triton died, and left his sonne Hammon inheritour to the kingdome of Affrica, otherwise called Lybia. After this, Noe passed forward, and at the length arrived in Spaine, which was two hundred fiftie nine yeares after the floud, and in the tenth yeare of the raigne of Ninus the third king of Babylon. Iuball or Tuball, the fift son of Iaphet, and the first king of Spaine (as all hystories do affirme) received his grand∣father Noe Ianus, and his grandmother Tytea, with hono∣rable entertainement and all gladsome willingnesse: who also were exceeding joyfull to see the prosperous estate of their nephew Iuball, for so much as they found, that hee governed his people with great justice, policie, and good lawes, as Berosus in a certaine place alleadgeth, saying: Anno Nini quarto Tuyscon gigas Sarmatas, legibus format apud Rhenum: Idipsum agit Iubal apud Celtiberos (hoc est Hispanos) & Samothes apud Celtas. Noe therefore to helpe his nephew for the better peopling of his countrey, foun∣ded there two great citties, calling the one Noela and the other Noegla, in remembrance and honour of those his two faire daughters, so called, beeing the wives of Iaphet and Cham: & after this, departed for Italie to his nephew or grand child Comerus Gallus, the first sonne of Iaphet, whom before he had appointed to bee king of that coun∣trey.
In this voyage, and in his remaine in Spaine, were spent nine yeares. Now it is not written, whether he went this journey into Italie by land or sea, notwithstanding it is very likely, and agreeth with good probabilitie, that in this his voyage he would not passe by without visiting the wise prince, his nephew Samothes, the brother of Iuball king of Spaine, who was by his appointment created the first king of Fraunce, as is before touched, and hee had raigned about this time sixe score yeares, and lived after this in peace and tranquillitie five and thirtie yeares and upward. The second time of the comming of Ianus thus into Italie, was in the time of his age eight hundred and three∣score yeares (and now eight score since his last departure from thence) where thinking to find Comerus Gallus, hee now understood that he was dead, and that his son Cham, (contrarie to the appointment of Noe) not contented with the soveraigne domination of Affrica, had there wrongfully usurped the siegnorie of Italie, and had now commaunded over that countrey five and twentie yeares or therabouts: and which was worse, as all the other kings in Europe had instructed and governed their people in civilitie, manners, and education, hee contrarie to such their good examples, had most abhominably corrupted the youth of Italie with all manner of impieties, vices, and odious sinnes, which he with the helpe of those peo∣ple (called Aborigines, which he brought along with him to people the countrey) made them to embrace, entertain and live in. Noe upon the knowledge of this, waxt mar∣vellous heavie and discontent, as sorrowing for the un∣godlinesse of his owne sonne, and suffered him thus for
the space of three years to continue therin, hoping dayly to see some amendment or other in him: but finding him to persever therin, and rather to encrease in it than other∣wise, hee banisht him, with a certaine number of people with him, from out the confines of Italie; from whence departed, hee arrived in the Island of Sicilia, where hee with his companie long after lived. Ianus then taking upon himselfe the kingdome of Italy, which was now two hundred threescore and twelve yeares after the floud, he began like a carefull governour to root out and seperate the infectious sheepe out of the whole flocke, least with their impurities all should be corrupted, and so hee chose out a certaine number of people which were tainted with the vices of their commaunder that last ruled (and which people were called Aborigenes) & com∣manded them to depart out of the country, over the river Tybre, first called Ianiculum: which thing they performed and demaunded for their queene and governesse Crana, Noes daughter, which hee also graunted them: and he ap∣pointed a kingdome and government for them, and they were as is alreadie said, called Aborigines, & those which were left in Italie, were called Ianigines, after his owne name. He had not long rained here, but he caused to bee built on this side of the river Tybre, towards Tuscania, a marvellous great cittie on the top of a high mountaine, which he then called Ianiculum, & after that Vaticanum, and since the towne of S. Peter of Rome, and it was seated on the same place, which at this day S. Peters church stan∣deth upon, as also the Popes pallace, called at this day in Italian, Belvedere, which is as much as, The faire sight. Round about those countries to the river Arnus, which
passeth through Florence, to the bounds of Sardinia, did Noe cause to bee inhabited and made populous in those daies: wherein also he built and erected many most beau∣tifull cities, which he called Aryn Ianas, id est, ex Iano ex∣altatas: and hee began then also to write and set downe lawes and institutions for the civile administration of ju∣stice, and government of Commonweales, which he first prescribed in the citie of Vetulonia, called since Viterbe: and instructed the people also in the sciences of Physicke, Astronomie, and Divinitie, and in the ceremonious rites and customes belonging to holy sacrifices; and of these also he made many and severall bookes. It hath beene mentioned before, how that upon Noes last departure out of Armenia, hee constituted and esta∣blished his nephew Sabatius Saga, surnamed Saturne, to rule as King and Patriarke over that countrey; wherein he afterward raigned peaceably, even untill the time of the raigne of Iupiter Belus, the sonne of Nembroth, the second king of Babilon: who yeelding unto his disordinat desires, and coveting to command as sole Monarch of the whole world, was the first violater & infringer of the ordinances appointed in those daies, and by whose means the golden age afterward lost such her title, and never since was called so: for before such his over haughtie humors, all things were peaceable, common, & free. This Iupiter endevored by all devises possible to overturne the greatnesse of Sa∣batius Saga, surnamed Saturne, and commanded also his sonne Ninus to undertake all meanes how to bring him and his family to death and destruction: which thing they jointly effectuated so far, as hardly escaped hee the snares and subtilties laid to entrap him. Saturne therefore seeing
himselfe in those daungers and casualties, to be deprived of all dignitie and commaund, for succour and refuge fled unto his grandfather Noe, there hoping to bee protected, safe guarded, and defended, which thing also Virgil thus remembreth: Primus ab ethereo venit Saturnus Olimpo,Virgil. Whereupon Poets feign, that Saturne was banisht heaven by Iupiter. arma Iovis fugiens & regnis exul ademptis. Noe, according to the expectation of Saturn, friendly entertained him, & gave him many gracious signes of his welcome & wished arrivall: and for to honour him the more, and to shew the effects of his friendship and good will towards him, crea∣ted him the Commaunder, King, and Patriarke of the Aborigenes, whom lately wee specified: and there caused him also to build a citie, which hee called after his owne name, Saturnia, hard by that of Ianus, called Ianiculum; in which very place at this day one part of Rome, which lieth on the other side of the river Tybre, standeth, and is erected; as Virgil also in his Eneidos mentioneth,Virgil. where he bringeth in Aeneas speaking to Evander, saying: Haec duo preterea disiectis opida muris, Reliquias veterum vides monumenta virorum, Ianiculum huic, fuerat, illi Saturnia nomen. Ianus then and Saturne thus raigning together, Titea the great, Noes wife, began in those times first to set up the order of Nuns, and ceremonies of Vestall virgins, inventing then the setting up of lights and lampes in the churches and temples dedicated to the profession of vir∣ginitie and chastitie, which custome was in those daies very reverently regarded, and endured in great honor and reputation, even unto the time of the Romanes. Saturne likewise very painefully instructed the people in tillage, and in the nature of soiles, wherein he had great skill and knowledge, as also in the ceremonies of religion: and not
long after (having instituted his sonne Sabus to bee the successor to the kingdome of the Sabines and Aborige∣nes) he died, in the three hundred and fortie fourth yeare after the inundation of the world. In the very same yeare also, Noe Ianus finding & perceiving his end to approch, and that now his lustinesse and vigour of spirits began to shrinke and decrease, created one of his sonnes, called Cranus, the King and Patriarke over the Ianigenes (which are now called Tuscanes) and the sixt yeare after departed this life, and gave up to his maker, his noble and heroicke spirit: which was after he had raigned in Italie fourescore and two yeares, and after the floud three hundred fortie six yeares, before the foundation of Troy foure hundred and fourescore, and before the incarnation of Christ, one thousand nine hundred threescore and seven yeares, and in the age of the same Noe, nine hundred and fiftie. The death of this good King and Patriarke possessed almost all the people in the world with great sorrow and lamentation, and especially the Armenians and Italians, who in most honorable manner celebrated his obsequies with such their then used rites and ceremonies, and after∣ward dedicated and attributed unto him divine honours and godlike adoration, building and consecrating tem∣ples and holy aultars unto him, calling him by divers and severall names and titles, as the Sun, the Heaven, the Seed of the world, the Father of the gods, the Soul of the world, the God of peace, the giver of justice and holinesse, the expulser of things hurtfull: also their children and succes∣sours called him Ianus, Geminus, Quadrisons, Enoirius, Ogyges, Vertumnus, Vadymon, Protheus, Multisors, Diespi∣ter, and Iupiter: and they invented all manner of honours
and straunge worships to reverence and adore him: they also shaped foorth his picture into diverse formes and fa∣shions: sometimes setting him foorth with two faces, to signifie thereby his wisdome upon every matter and every occasion: sometimes also with foure faces, to denotate therby that he was the god of the yeare for that he had so devided it into four several parts, being the Spring, Sum∣mer, Autumn, and Winter,Macrobius. as Macrobius in his Saturnals also remembreth, saying: Ianus apud nos in quatuor partes spectat, ut demonstrateius simulachrum èphaleris advectū: Afterwards, the Phenicians pourtraied him foorth in the forme of a Dragon, biting her taile, to shew thereby the roundnesse, and the beginning and ending of the yeare. In honour of him also at this day the first moneth of the yeare is called after his owne name Ianuarius,Servius. as Servius in his Aeneidos affirmeth. The ancients likewise have sha∣ped him forth with two keyes in his hand, to shew thereby that he was the invent or of gates and dores, as also of the locking of them and making them fast, to the end, that the holy temples and sacred places should not bee polluted with the impious abuse of theeves and uncivile persons, and to avoid adulteries and other such like sinnes then raigning; and of his name since have all dores and gates been called Ianuae. In many other sorts and formes have the auncients defigured the image of this Noe Ianus, as Propertius and many others have written, who in the fourth booke of his Elegies, thus speaketh: Quid mirare meas tot in uno corpore formas? Accipe Vertumni signa paterna dei Tuscus ego Tuscis orior, &c.
And undoubtedly, there hath not beene read of any that lived so uprightly and justly as this Patriarke Noe, neither that ever any had such honours, reverence, and godlike adoration done unto him, both in his life time, and after his death, who also was among those people in those daies called God: neither is it to bee wondered, that in those elder times there were so many gods held & wor∣shipped among the auncients, for so much as it is to bee understood, That in those daies all those princes, rulers, and governors that had lived vertuously, justly, and godly, and had commaunded their people with mildnesse, equi∣tie, and uprightnesse, were entearmed gods, and that also without performing any idolatrous adoration or reve∣rence unto them, as Metasthenes, an auncient author and hystorian of Persia affirmeth, where hee thus saith: Ante Nynum ducentis & quadragintà novem annis regnatum fuit sub tribus dijs regibus, quorum qui primus universo im∣peravit orbi, fuit Ogyges, qui prefuit inundationi terrarū, &c. Cathon also, another very auncient writer, thus speaketh: Italia complura a dijs & ducibus sortita fuit nomina, à Iano Ianicula quem quidem Enotrium dictum existimant, quia invenit uvum & far. And for these and such like reasons, Moyses and other godly Patriarkes were called gods, not that they were so in essence, but onely in participation, as in the seventh chapter of Exodus it is written: Ego te dedi deum Pharaoni: and in the the three and twenty chapter, Dijs non detrahes, & principem populi tui ne maledicas. Further also the Prophet David thus sayth: Principes po∣pulorum congregati sunt, cum deo Abraham, quoniam dij fortes terrae vehementer elevati sunt. These things are thus so amply and at large exposed,
to the end, that the reader of this Treatise should not so much marvell or wonder when mention is made in this booke of gods and goddesses, which in those daies were so much observed and reverenced.Ovid. Ovid rehearsing the words of this Noe Ianus, and shewing that in his death the golden age ceased, thus sayth: Tunc ego regnabam patiens cum terra deorum Esset, & humanis numina mixta locis Nondum iustitiam, facinus mortale fugarat, Vltima de superis illa reliquit humum, Proque meta populum, sive vt pudor ille regebat, Nullus erat iustis reddere iura labor Nil mihi cum bello, postes pacem que tuebar, &c. And as Noe was among these auncients thus honored and adored, and temples and altars consecrated unto him: so also was Titea his wife held in great reverence, worship, and holy esteeme, who was called also Vesta, Aretia, Terra, Regina sacrorum, magna Cybeles, Materque deorum, atque Vestalium Princeps, sive Abbatissa, as Berosus and other writers affirme. Having thus touched the death of this good Patriarke Noe, it shall not bee now impertinent something to remember and speake of the wicked and abhominable life of his degenerate sonne Cham, which although of it selfe it be worthlesse of any recapitulation or recitall, yet to descend to the lineall genealogie of the Lybian Hercules the Great, it cannot bee well omitted: from which Hercules, Dardanus the first founder and erecter of Troy, descended and came.
It hath been alreadie specified, how Noe deviding the universall earth unto his children, and how Cham aboun∣ding in all vices and detestable courses, notwithstanding was not deprived of his portion, but had his right of inhe∣ritance justly allotted unto him, which was the third part of the world, and particularly Affrica to the hether part of Aegypt; for which countries he was commaunded by his father to depart, with his wife Noegla, and five and thir∣tie rulers (which is as much to say, as the cheefes of fami∣lie of his bloud and house) as also with all their children and issue: which was accordingly performed, and present∣ly he established himselfe as king and Saturne of Aegypt, where he erected and built a citie called Chem-Myn: and among them also, he himselfe was called Pan, and Silva∣nus, which people likewise (so engendred and issued of that familie) to honour and worship him the more, and to shew their love unto him, lived in all impious and ungra∣cious manner, perpetrating most odious and soule-dam∣ning villanies, affirming publickly, That men ought law∣fully to have the companie of their owne mothers, sisters, and daughters, in all lusts and concupiscence of the flesh; and other many most inhumane and shamefull acts, not to be recited. And to shew that they gloried and bosted in the wickednesse of such their king and ruler, they entear∣med him by the name of Cham Esenuus, which signifieth their infamous god Pan. And thus he ruled in Egipt long time, even unto the six and fiftith yeare of the raigne of Iupiter Belus, the second king of Babylon: in the which yeare he began to travell, and came into Italie (which was then called Kytim) to his brother Comerus Gallus, the first king of that countrey; after whose death, Cham presently
usurped and undertooke that mightie governement: who in stead of vertuous instructions and godly laws, in which all other princes round about him, his kinsmen (com∣maunding Germanie, Spaine, and France) had instructed and taught their people, cleane contrarie infected the youth of Italie with all manner of impieties, incivilitie, and corruptible vices: persuading them (beeing of them∣selves well addicted) to usurie, robberie, murder, poyso∣nings, and the studie of the Magicke art, who by reason of his owne great skill therein, was surnamed Zoroastes, and was the first inventor and practiser of that vild and di∣abolicall learning, of the use of which hee composed and writ many bookes, and hee was called generally through∣out the world, Cam Esenuus, id est, Cam infamis, & impudi∣cus, propagator. Some have thought, That the Turke for those and such like causes, is called in his letters patents, le grand Cam de Tartaria. It is written, That Cham had one sister which was called Rhea, maried to Hammon king of Lybia, who also was enamoured of one other faire woman, called Almanthea, and had of her by adulterous meanes, a son, whose name afterwards was Dionysius; which child was secretly broght up and nourished in a certaine citie of Arabia, called Ny∣sa: notwithstanding, the matter was not so closely & cun∣ningly handled, but his wife Rhea had privie advertise∣ments thereof. Whereupon in despight and jealous dis∣content, she forsooke her husband, and went home to her brother Cham (then abiding in the Island of Sicilia) who presently maried and espoused her, and (as some writers hold) his wife Noegla being alive: but of this other he after∣wards got many children, as Cus the father of Nembroth,
the first king of Babylon, Typhon the gyant, and also many others. Cham and his owne sister Rhea thus maried together, they consulted and advised to be revenged of king Ham∣mon of Lybia, and to that effect raised a great armie of men, and with the assistance and helpe of their brothers (the sixteene gyants) they set forwards from Sycilia, and in the end arrived within the territories and confines of Lybia, where they gave king Hammon battell, and in the field overthrew and vanquisht him, so that he was glad to flie into the Isle of Crete (now called Candia:) not long after this, Rhea had a sonne of her husband Cham, called Osyris, afterwards surnamed Iupiter Iustus, who prooved a most noble and gallant prince, far differing from the wic∣ked humors and dispositions of his father. After this, about the three and fortieth yeare of the raigne of Nynus king of Babylon, Dionysius the sonne of king Hammon and of the faire Almanthea, now beeing come to age and of mans estate, began now to think up∣on the wrong offered unto his father by Cham & Rhea, in usurping the commaund of Lybia, and determined ac∣cordingly to bee revenged upon them, which also hee af∣terwards performed, and expulst them againe out of the countrey, investing himselfe in the regaltie thereof. Not∣withstanding, he used Osyris (the yong sonne of Cham and Rhea) with great clemencie and mercie, and receaved him as his adopted child, and in remembrance of his father called him also Hammon and Iupiter: and brought him up very carefully in the studie of letters and other neces∣sarie gifts: over whom he appointed as schoolmaister and tutor, a learned man called Olympus, of whom afterwards
Osyris took his name, and was surnamed Olympicus. After that Cham and his wife and sister Rhea were thus discomfi∣ted and overthrowne by Dionysius the new king of Lybia, and now retired with such disgrace into the furthermost and obscurest corners of Aegypt; Rhea was presently upon this, delivered of a daughter called Iuno, which was also called Isis the Great: and this was in the first yeare of the raigne of Semyramis, which was three hundred and two yeares after the floud: and this Isis was accounted for the fairest, as also the best disposed ladie of the world. But her unfortunat & wicked father Cham, now remaining in Ae∣gypt (as hath beene alreadie specified) was not contented with such his habitation there, but seeking further (as over ambitiously enclined) arrived in the countrey of Bactria, not far from Persia, where he so wrought and pre∣vailed with his diabolicall skill of Negromancie, that he subjugated and brought under all those people therea∣bouts, insomuch as hee there raigned in great puissance, pride, and mightinesse: and yet not with this satisfied, ga∣thereth great troupes and armies of men, and invadeth the Assyrians, against whome marcheth their king called Nynus the young, the sonne of the before mentioned Se∣myramis, whose fortune was such, as hee victoriously tri∣umphed over his enemy Cham, suppressing his glory, rule, and haughtinesse, he himselfe being in that battell slaine, and all the armie shamefully discomfited. Many writers have affirmed, That this Cham was a man of singular ingenuitie and sharpe capacitie, and that hee first found out the seven liberall Sciences, and had wrote many bookes of great worth, among which, his cheefest were of Negromancie, of which, most part of them were
burned by the beforesaid Nynus. Some also say, That hee onely in the world came out of his mothers womb laugh∣ing and with a smiling countenance, which is an uncouth thing, and (as most hold) prognosticating no good. Vnto this Cham, Tiphon the Gyant (his eldest sonne by Noegla) was heire, and also succeeded him in humors and malici∣ous dispositions, who was brought up in Aegypt, & there continued. And now also it shall bee fit to revert our hy∣storie unto the two yongest children of Cham Zoroastes, which excelled in all good parts and vertuous inclination as their father abounded in the contrary, & that was that Osyris before spoken of (the adopted sonne of Dionysius, king of Lybia) and Isis his sister, the fairest & best accom∣plisht damosell in the world, whom afterward he tooke to wife and maried, with whome hee had also the kingdome and principalitie of Aegypt. These two now newly espou∣sed, he being of threescore yeares of age, and shee about fiftie (and yet our author Berosus tearms them very youth∣full) began to applie themselves to the studie of the nature of hearbes, and to the finding out of planting, tilling, and sowing of corne, which afterwards they instructed their people in, and shewed the use to their neighbors dwelling in Palestina, of which ruled king and governour Sem, sur∣named Melchisedech, who was the first that ever offered bread and wine unto God. From thence Osyris passed in∣to Aegypt, and there also very painefully shewed them the manner of tilling and agriculture, as likewise the Poet Ti∣bullus speaketh of,Tibullus. saying: Primus aratra manu solerti fecit Osyris, Et tenerum ferro sollicitavit humum.
Afterward he travelled into many other countries, alwaies learning them (then living by acornes, nuts, and water) in the knowledge of such his new invention; and by these gentle and mild courses hee gained the love of all people, and by that meanes almost possest himselfe of all the world, with the regalities and principalities there∣of (the Empire of Babylon onely excepted) whose con∣quests, victories, prevailements, and powers, we wil some∣thing more amplie hereafter remember, following as wel our owne authour Berosus, as also Diodorus Siculus, the learned Catasthenes, and many other authenticke authors herein in their bookes and writings of matters of elder times, and subiects of antiquity Osyris therfore (surnamed Iupiter Iustus) having by his wife and sister Isis (otherwise called Iuno) and also of many other ladies, which here shal bee needlesse to recite) many children, as Hercules the great, Anubis, Macedon, Lidus, Meon, Neptune, Oros, and also many others, hee assembleth a mightie armie of all sorts of people, both puissant and subtill, and leaving the governement of the kingdome of Aegypt to the queene Isis, carying along with him some of his aforesaid chil∣dren, he taketh a long and wearisome journy. The cheefe place of commaund in all his armie, hee appointed unto his eldest son Hercules of Lybia, who upon his escutchion and armes, bare depainted the shape of a crowned Lion rampant, holding in his forefeet a mightie hatchet. His two other brothers, Anubis and Macedon, caried defigured on their shields, the one a Dog, the other a Wolfe; accor∣ding to the signification of their names. The armes of the Emperour Osyris was a royall scepter, and under that, the forme of an eye: as who searcheth the monuments of
antiquitie, may there find it out: by which is perceived how auncient an usage the giving of armes is, and how to bee respected. And in those times all good and just princes were called gods, as Pan, Apollo, Iupiter, and infinit others, with their goddesses, muses, and nymphs. This mightie, powerfull, and gallant armie thus gathe∣red together, the Emperour Osyris proceedeth in his en∣tended voyage, and therein compasseth round the whole universall earth: his first resistance was upon his entering into Affrica, where was opposed against him the Gyant Antheus, but him he presently overthrew. After that, hee quietly passed into India and Aethyopia, where hee did great good in instructing the poore ignorant people in the true knowledge of necessarie nutriment and victuals, telling them the manner how to governe and command with policie, justice, and equitie. Here also hee subdued many most ougly and fierce Gyants, full of crueltie and bloud, who generally with their greatnesse had tyrannized over all those countries of Asia. He slew the tyrant Busiris of Phoenicia, which used to sacrifice men and women un∣to the gods. After this, hee arrived in Phrygia, and there also subjugated the Gyant Typhon, in whose commaund and place he established one of his owne sonnes, ruling there, beeing the place where Troy afterward was ere∣cted. From thence hee came by long passages, into this part of the world, being Europe, through the streights of the sea called Hellespont, since called the arm of S. George deviding Grecia from Turkie. At this time ruled in Thracia (which is that part of Greece where Constantinople is erected) a most horrible tyrant and inhumane Gyant called Lycurgus, who now
denied passage through his countrey unto Osyris, and at the first fiercely resisted his approches, but in the end, in gallant fight, he slew him with his owne hands, and remai∣ned victor and sole commaunder of that countrey: which afterwards he resigned to one of his owne followers called Maron, being a young and valiant prince. From thence he passed into another province called Emathia, in which also ruled many bloudie and cruell Gyants, all which hee cleane extirpated, destroyed, and subdued, setling the countrey in peaceable quietnesse and security, over which he appointed to be commaunder, one of his own sonnes before spoken of, called Macedon, who afterwards called that countrey after his owne name, Macedonia, and the people Macedonians, of whom descended and issued the everfamous conquerour, Alexander the great. Out of this countrey, the Emperour Osyris presently departed, and came into the Isle of Crete (now called Candia) where he vanquished the Gyant Milinus, a tyrannicall and soure governour, yet hee appointed his sonne (in whome good hopes appeared of good governement) to be king of the said Island. From these parts he returned again into Gre∣cia, and so to Scythia, now called Tartaria, where he found his eldest son, the great Hercules of Lybia, in prosperous estate: who at this instant was extreamely enamoured of a ladie called Araxa, by whom afterwards he begat a sonne called Tuscus, which long after was king of Italie, and of whome descended king Dardanus, the first founder and builder of Troy. From Tartaria, the mightie Emperour Osyris (surnamed Iupiter Iustus) and his sonne Hercules are now departed, and in short space arived in Hungarie, and so came into Almaign or Germanie, even unto the floud
of Duno, not farre from the famous river of Rhyne, where (finding the country something populous) he made some stay and residence, painefully instructing them in the sow∣ing of corne and planting of vines: and builded also in this place diverse villages and cities, of whom, hee beeing also surnamed Apis) the mighty house of the Counts of Has∣bourgh in Germanie tooke her name; from which hath issued the noble and illustrious house of Austria, since in great power and greatnesse exceedingly flourishing. He also there gave the names unto the cheefest hils & moun∣taines thereabouts, whereof at this day some are called Appenini. And from thence hee passed into Italie, which presently shall be further showne, and as that very ancient authour affirmeth,Cathon. whom wee call Cathon the auncient, saying: Aurea et as usque ad Apina deorum Italiae ultimum, &c. In these times there reigned in Germanie a prince, cal∣led Gambrivius, the vij. king of the Germanes, descended from the house of Tuyscon the Gyant, the first king of that countrey, and the sonne of Noe. With this prince the em∣perour Osyris made long residence, and was roially feasted and entertained, as being indeed near in kinred and con∣sanguinitie, who accordingly received him and his traine with great joy and gladnesse. The countrey of Italie about this time was extreamly opprest with the tyrannie & blou∣die fashions of infinit numbers of Gyants that therabouts then lived, called Titans, insomuch, as the people of the countrey, not able longer to tollerate and endure those such slavish impositions and unsufferable tyrannies, (hea∣ring
of the fame and late arrivall of the Emperour Osyris into Germanie) sent their messengers or embassadours unto him, most humbly craving and desiring his favoura∣ble assistance and protection against those barbarous and uncivile oppressors, and that he would make a journy thi∣ther to deliver them from the miserable servitude & bon∣dage that they then were forced to abide and live in. The Emperor Osyris or Iupiter hearing and accepting of their distressed condition and case, willingly condescended to leave Germanie, and to undertake a voyage thither, to re∣dresse and suppresse their wrongs, and the Gyants super-arrogant pride, glory, and haughtinesse: which, although they were of kinred and alliance unto him, yet in respect of their uncivile and tyrannicall usances, he instantly pro∣ceeded to the redressement thereof: and in three severall battels utterly overthrew, vanquisht, and discomfited them, and thereupon tooke upon him the governement of the principalitie of Italie, which (long before) his fa∣ther Cham and his grandfather Noe were also possessed of: and hee commaunded and ruled over the Italians for the space of eleven yeares, where for the most part hee remai∣ned in the citie of Viterbe, called also Vetulonia, and at the end of eleven yeares, in great triumph, joy, and glorie, instituted his nephew Lestrigon the Gyant (the son of his son Neptune) king, commander, & ruler over all the coun∣trey of Italie. But for so much as in this booke mention is made oftentimes of strange and horrible Gyants, & other rare and admirable things, the reader may perhaps remain in∣credulous, and scarse beleeve them to bee true, accoun∣ting them wholly fabulous, and by invention fashioned,
yet to alleadge some authoritie for the confirmation ther∣of (leaving out infinite other examples of infallible cer∣tainetie) you only shall be referred to the holy scriptures, and also unto Iosephus the Iewish writer, who amply hath handled the apologie therof: among the rest, Nembroth, Golias, and others, are apparent, that they were Gyants, and of unusuall stature, strength, & proportion of bodie. If the authoritie of Boccace may be accepted, he thus wri∣teth of himselfe: In my time (sayth hee) there was found under the foot and hollow caverne of a mountaine, not far from the citie of Deprana, in the Isle of Sicilia, the bodie of a marvellous, huge, and strange proportioned Gyant, which seemed to hold in one of his hands a mightie long peece of wood like unto the bodie of a young tree, or the mast of a ship, which so soone as it was touched, fell all in∣to ashes and dust, but it was all garnisht & wrought about with lead, which remained sound and firm, & it was found to weigh five hundred pound weight: his bodie also being touched, consumed, and became all pouder and ashes, except certaine of his bones, and three of his teeth, which were also peized, and every tooth weighed fortie ounces. For the height and full stature of his bodie; it was conje∣ctured by the people of that countrey, to be two hundred cubits long. And the same authour sayth, That his teeth were afterwards hanged up in our ladies church of Depra∣na, for a straunge monument, and a thing of wonderfull admiration. In many other places are the bones of gyants that lived in those daies, kept and preserved for woonders and reliques of memorie, but yet not of so uncouth and almost incredible hugenesse: but leaving these matters to bee further ruminated by the scrupulous, I will returne
to our maine intendment proceeding, till I have further explaned the obscuritie thereof. These things above spoken of, being atchieved by Osy∣ris against those Gyants and molesters of civile conversa∣tion, he departed out of Italie with all his royall armie, sin∣gularly well prepared and in gallant equipage, accompa∣nied with gods, heroes, demie gods, and martialists, that is, with all valiant, courageous, and wise princes, rulers, and captaines: and it is not written, whether in this his journey he passed through Gaule (now called Fraunce) or went that way by sea, but hard by the continent hee coa∣sted, in which then ruled one Lucus, king of that famous countrey: but howsoever he journeied, hee now is strived in Spaine, where once againe hee renued mortall battels against the Tytans, which were mightie Gyants, and cou∣sins to those he before discomfited in Italie, these also hee now subdueth and quite raseth out all their generation, leaving the governement of that countrey to the com∣maund of Gerion. And from thence he againe sayled into Greece, and arived in the province of Peloponnesus, now called Morea: and hee there setled himselfe, and ruled in the citie of Arges for the space of five and thirtie yeares, as it is written by Eusebius in his booke of Time. After this he createth his sonne Egialus, king of Achaia,Eusebius. and so re∣turneth againe into Aegypt, there to spend his latter daies with his wife and sister Isis, surnamed Iuno; who tooke such his comming home in full joyous acceptance and glad∣some pleasingnesse. By this time all the world had beene filled with the report of Osyris great fame and worthinesse, unto whom were ascribed and given many titles & names of triumph, as Iupiter Iustus, Dux, Rex, Consultor, Cuius
regnum perpetuum est, & habitatio in Olympo: all which were cleane contrary to those wherewith his father Cham was entituled. Being thus returned into his countrey of Aegypt, hee caused in many and severall parts and corners thereof, to bee erected certaine columnes and high pillars, in which he commaunded to bee cut out and engraved for the pre∣servation and memorie of his name and glory, these fol∣lowing lines,Diodorus Si∣culus. as Diodorus Siculus repeateth them: Mihi pater Saturnus deorum olim iunior, sum vero Osyris rex, qui vniversum peragravi orbem, usque ad Indorum desertos fines, ad eos quoque sum profectus, qui arcto subjacent, & Istri fontes, & usque Oceanum, sum Saturni filius antiquior, germen ex pulchro & generoso ortum, cui genus non semen fuit, nec fuit in orbe locus quem non adinerim, docens ea quorum in∣ventor fui. After hee thus was quietly seated in his kingdome of Aegypt, his brother Typhon the Aegyptian (who in all vil∣lanie & mallice followed the humors of his father Cham) began now to repine and envie at the glorie and fortune of the Emperor Osyris, in so much as he fell into a present conspiracie with many other mallicious Gyants for the death and destruction of him and of his greatnesse: which hee most traiterously prosecuted so far, as in the end, by subtill and craftie practises he entrapped him, who was by him and the rest of the Gyants cruelly murdered and torn in peeces, whose bodie they divided, and had hewne out into six and twentie peeces, whereof every Gyant had a
share and part, as a reward and satisfaction for such their bloudie and victorious stratageme: but afterwards these parts of his bodie were found out and gathered together againe by the meanes of his wife Isis, and buried, with their right honor and due solemnitie, whom after his death the Aegyptians held & worshipped as a god, as also the chil∣dren of Israel did the like in the desart. Boccace sayth, That hee was called also Serapis, and that the auncient Poets tearmed him likewise Dionysius, Liber Pater, and Bacchus, and that hee was the first that ever triumphed, which was in the first voyage hee made into the Indies; and that the invention of garlands and crownes was by him devised. Our authour Berosus by his collections seemeth to al∣leadge, That this Emperour Osyris was thus slaine in the prime and flower of his age, having attained onely unto three hundred yeares, for he was borne about the time of Ninus the third king of Babylon, and died in the raign of Baleus, the Babylonians eleventh king, by which it is very apparent, what woonderfull long time men in those ages did live. His wife Isis survived him two hundred and foure∣score yeares, as hereafter shall bee mentioned, who after that shee had with all fit ceremonies and rites performed the funerals of her murdered husband, began nowe to thinke upon the actors thereof, and to meditate upon re∣venge and direfull practises: whereupon she convocateth all her children and nephewes, and inciteth them to the embracement of this her attempt and action, against the horrible murderers of her newly enterred husband. To be short, they condiscend to her motion, and in the field en∣counter with Typhon and his associates, and in battell ut∣terly subdue them: which victorie was atchieved hard by
the river Oris in Arabia, and in the same place where Osy∣ris himselfe slew the mightie Gyant and tyrant Antheus. The world being thus delivered of the perverse generati∣on of Cham, Isis remained a peacefull and secure gover∣nesse and queene over Aegypt, which shee compassed as well by her owne pollicies and devises, as by the valour and hardie prowesse of her children, of which the cheefest and most valiant was called Hercules of Lybia, of whome now (withdrawing my pen for a while to speake further of Isis) I will more amply entreat. Hercules therefore, the most valourous and courage∣ous young prince, after hee had by this meanes revenged the death of his father Osyris upon his uncle Typhon, and the rest of his associates, began now to have a feeling of this owne power and vigour, and undertaketh many most tedious voyages, to scour all places of the world from the tyrannie and oppression of such inhumane and impious tyrants: and first he passed through the province of Phoe∣nicia, where he slew the tyrant Busyris, the sonne of him, whom Osyris before had slaine. From thence he went into Phrygia, where Troy afterward was built, and there over∣came the young tyrant Tipheus; and he gave the governe∣ment of that country to his own son Athus, which he begat of a ladie called Omphale, as hereafter shall bee declared. Likewise he vanquisht the Gyant Mylinus, the younger king of the Island of Candia: and from thence hee came into Affrica, since called Barbaria, of which, hee named most part of it Lybia after his owne name, which before was called Phutea: and there in memory of his conquests hee erected a columne and stately pinacle. From hence passing through the streights of Gibraltar, hee arrived in
Spaine, where upon his first landing, hee fought bodie to bodie against the three Gerions, which were brothers and joint commaunders and kings of Spaine, those also hee overcame and slew, and created his sonne Hispalus king and ruler of that countrey: which was now the ninth king thereof, and of whom the citie Hispalis, now called Sivile in Spaine, tooke her name and was so called. After this, Hercules determined to make a journey into Italie, there also to purchase further fame and reputation, by suppres∣sing the tyrannie of those that there then lived according to their owne will, power, and mightinesse. In this his jor∣ney towards Italie by land, he passeth through the king∣dome called Regnum Celticum, then called also Gaule, and at this day is knowne and nominated by the name of Fraunce: of the antiquitie of which countrey (before wee come to speake of his arrivall in Italie) having so fit occa∣sion, we will in this place something remember. First therefore we must find out and know in what time and in what age this famous Hercules of Lybia passed through the countrey in this his journey, for so much as it is not written of any certainetie, or by any authenticke author, That hee ever journeied through this kingdome before, although some doe hold, That hee went that way into Spaine with his father Iupiter (surnamed Iustus) in the reigne of Lucus, the eight king of Gaule, as hath been be∣fore somewhat commemorated: and this matter may bee easily and evidently discovered, by comparing the times wherein Hispalus was established and made king of Spain with those succeeding, of which,Johannes Annius. Iohannes Annius of Vi∣terbe, a most excellent writer & diligent Hystoriographer in his Chronicles of Spaine, sayth, That the same Hispa∣lus
was crowned and invested in the kingdome of Spaine by his father Hercules, in the six and thirtieth yeare of Ba∣leus (the second of that name) the eleventh king of Baby∣lonia; which was after the floud five hundred fourescore and ten years, before the foundation of Troy two hundred threescore and one, and before the incarnation of Christ a thousand seven hundred and seven and twenty: for Her∣cules was born presently after the death of Ninus, the third king of Babylon, from whose death unto the six and thir∣tieth yeare of Baleus, the eleventh king, were just two hun∣dred fourescore and ten yeares: so that by this meanes it may clearely bee perceived, in what time and in what age this Lybian Hercules so arrived in Gaule, being presently after the coronation of his sonne Hispalus in Spaine. At this very time therefore of his comming into Gaule (which wee will now hereafter call Fraunce) reigned and governed in that countrey as their king and commander, one called by the name of Iupiter Celtes, the sonne of king Lucus, whom before we a little touched, who exceeded all others in riches in those dayes, and was marvellous weal∣thie in sheepe, in cattell, and in pasturage, which were all the goods and possessions that princes in those times a∣bounded in, in that countrey; for then silver or gold was not there known, jewels and rare stones were disesteemed, no tributes were paied, no taxes or impositions laid upon the subjects, all things without deceit, art, or any villanous invention of mans braine, were peaceably enjoyed. And to confirme this their ignorance of silver and such mettals Diodorus Siculus thus sayth, That the sheepheards of this king Iupiter Celtes, attending their flockes on the top of those mountaines which devide the kingdome of Fraunce
from that of Spaine, called Pyrenci, espied on the suddain on the one side of the furthermost hils, certaine liquid moisture to run downe in hastie streames into the vallies below; and at the higher part of that mountaine, certaine flames of fire in most furious manner to shew themselves, in so much, that very hard rockes and stonie substances on that mountaine were dissolved and were melted with the extremitie of the heat and riscaldation of those fires: which also ceased not, but continued in that strange ma∣ner many moneths together. The silly and simple under∣standing of these sheepeheards, by no meanes assumed any apprehension of this so straunge working of nature, but entertained it as a matter exceeding their capacitie and reach of judgement, and therefore passed it over with the lesser woonder, in that they acknowledged in them∣selves so deepe an imperfection and want of knowledge. But it so fortuned, That certaine merchants of Phoenicia travelling along those coasts, and perceiving that that mettal must needs be good which so distilled and tumbled downe from the tops of those mountains (being, as many old writers alleadge, the mettall of silver) began to feele the dispositions of those all ignorant sheepeheards, and to come to some composition and friendly tearmes for exchaunge of some wares they had, with that mettall, which those hils in that plentie so affourded and yeelded forth. The poore sheepeheards (as I told you before) not capable of the true value thereof, for matters of very little worth (which those merchants then had) exchaunged the one for the other, without any suspect of disadvantage or ill bargaine on their sides: and therupon the Phoenicians laded and fraughted their ships (then abiding in a port or
haven not farre of) with that mettall which those silver mines so produced, and afterwards enriched their coun∣trey therewith in most abundant and plentifull manner: and by the reason of these fires, those hils were afterwards entearmed and called Montes Pyrenaei, for Pyr in Greeke signifies Feu in French, and fire in English. But to returne from whence we digressed. This royall king, Iupiter Celtes which before wee remembered, had one onely daughter, which hee prized and endeared as his cheefest good; who exceeded all other ladies in the world, in proportion and stature, and in the graces of naturall beautie, and for that she was of so extraordinarie and large talnesse, shee was in those daies held among those people a Gyantesse. This ladie, whether proud of her own goodly features, or chast in her cogitations, could not by any meanes bee brought to affect any man whatsoever living, neither would her fa∣ther consent to any match or mariage, that might be oc∣casion to take her from his sight, and the fruition of her so desired presence, untill the comming of this so far-famou∣sed and renowned Hercules of Lybia (of whose great wor∣thinesse and straunge performances, they had largely heard) they of themselves intertained a new thought, and were easily induced, upon the first sight of his personage (which was majesticke and of wondrous grace) to unite their house with one of so noble demerit and of so gene∣rall fame. Hercules likewise became so far ensnared with the gallant beautie, big proportion, and equisit perfecti∣ons of Galathea (for so was the ladie called) that he instant∣ly discovered the motions of his affections and love to∣wards her, which were reciprocally embraced and kindly entertained: so that there rested onely the consummation
of the nuptials, which were presently after performed with all maner of solemnization and rites of ceremonies observed in those dayes. Not long after the mariage of the Giantesse Galathea unto Hercules, her father Iupiter Celtes died, who for his vertuous life and good governe∣ment, was held in that reputation, esteeme, & reverence among those people, that ever since that day, the third part of all that countrey of France is called after his own name Celtica. After him succeeded his sonne in law Her∣cules, and tooke upon him the commaund and governe∣ment of the countrey of Fraunce, living peaceably and prosperously with his wife Galathea many yeares, and taught also the people new courses how to live, & better customes and fashions of behavior, controlling them for their rude and uncivile manners, and wholly depressing a most inhumane and impious order they had, of sacrificing poore strangers unto their gods, this hee abolished and wholly extinguished, enjoyning streight lawes, & punish∣ments for the violaters and infringers of such his com∣maundement herein. Not long after, he built and erected a most gallant and mightie citie, which hee caused to bee seated on a high mountaine of that countrey, which now is called by the name of the Dutchie of Burgundie, be∣tweene Authun & Langres, which citie he called Alexia, which interpreted, signifies conjunctive or uniting, to shew that there were two noble houses of straunge coun∣tries conjoined and made one. This citie afterwards flouri∣shed in great glorie and puissance, and especially in the times of Iulius Caesar, before which, hee himselfe with a most strong armie lay, begirting the same with a most strict & hard siege: at which time, the giving of the flowers
de Luces in Fraunce tooke his originall, as Iulius Caesar himselfe in his seventh booke of his Commentaries affir∣meth. But at this present, that once gallant and glorious citie of Alexia is but a mean village, and of small account in the countrey of Lauxois not far from Flauigny. The great citie of Alexia thus in those daies peopled, inhabited, and fortified by the great Hercules, the king of Gaule: after some orders and institutions appointed for the good governance and managing of all things what∣soever at home, hee proceedeth in his entended voyage for Italie, and for that expedition raised a mightie and powerfull armie; with which, after hee had taken his leave of his wife Galathea, and of his young sonne Galatheus, (now aged about foure yeares or thereabouts) he progres∣seth to the effectuating of his first entendment, and pre∣sently enters into the territories of the Allobroges (which countrey is now called Savoy) and there with main force of many hands and laborious souldiours, hee maketh his passage through those wondrous high rockie mountains, in all ordinarie sence and opinion then inaccessible and not to be passed; but as the extreame industrie and pain∣fulnesse of worke bringeth all difficult things in the end to obedience and commaund of art, so these undisgested heapes of stubborne stones and rockes, were forced at the last to give way unto his armie, so far, that all their horses and baggage whatsoever found a very plaine and easie passage. From thence he descended and came into Italy, where he fully revenged himselfe of those inhumane and lawlesse Gyants, which were the death of his owne father Iupiter Iustus: and after all tumults quieted, and the resi∣stants subdued, hee fell to prescribe lawes to the people,
and to instruct them very carefully in matters of civile as∣sociation & orderly living: where we will for a while leave him, and once againe betake our selves more particularly to entreat of the first originall & inhabitation of France: to begin with which, it must of necessitie be drawn by the lineall succession and discent of father to son, even unto that Iupiter Celtes, and this Hercules of Lybia wee so lately remembred. It hath beene in the beginning of this booke related, how in the hundred yeare after the universall inundation and deluge of al things whatsoever which were contained in the wide embracement of the world, the good father and Patriarke Noe made his first voyage, and put foorth from Armenia with all those his children, nephewes, and kinsfolkes, to discover unto them the situation of many other countries then unknowne: and that hee first passed over the Ponticke sea, and so to the arme of the sea Medi∣terraneum, coasting along the continent about all those quarters; of purpose to shew unto his children the devisi∣on of the world, and Cosmographically to instruct them in the situation of each severall countrey, as they stood and were inhabited before the floud: and after that, to pro∣portionize unto his three first begotten sonnes, every one his share and allowance for his rule, commaund, and do∣mination, as hath been before alreadie spoken of. And in these his travels, hee brought also along with him many sorts of beasts, cattell, hearbes, and other such things that were availeable for the encrease and maintenance of hu∣mane life; and with every one of his children or kinsfolke left a certaine allowance of such things, there to multiply and engender. In this his first perigrination, he came into
Gaule, and so into Italie, where after hee had spent some time, hee returned backe into Armenia, about the tenth yeare he had set forth from thence: by which it may bee gathered, that Gaule was first inhabited and peopled in the hundred and eight yeare after the generall floud. After this his returne into Armenia, having there re∣sted himselfe some one and twentie yeares, hee began to invent the foundations of great citties, and to establish kingdomes and siegnories throughout the world: so that in the hundred and two and thirtieth year after the deluge he first erected and appointed the monarchie of the Ba∣bylonians, of which, the first king was called Nembroth, Noes cousin: and about the thirteenth yeare of the raigne of this Nembroth, hee instituted and established for the king of the Gaules one other of his kinsmen called Samo∣thes, surnamed Dis, the fourth sonne of Iaphet, a man very wise and well governed. Samothes therefore accordingly tooke his leave of the Patriarke Noe, his grandmother Ti∣tea, of his father Iaphet, and of his mother Noegla and the rest of his kindred, and set forward toward his kingdome and governement with all expedition possible: carying along with him diverse sorts of cattell, poultrey, and other things necessarie for the maintaining and conservation of mankind (which kind of things were all the riches & trea∣sures that men desired to possesse in those daies:) and thus with all his traine, familie, and followers, hee taketh ship∣ping in the sea called Marc major, and in the end, by the favorable assistance of prosperous winds, he arrived with∣in the confines of Gaule, which was some seven & thirtie yeares after his first being there with his grandfather Noe, and about eightscore and foure yeares after the deluge:
by which it may bee understood, That this Samothes the fourth sonne of Iaphet, was little lesse than seven score yeares of age, when he now last visited the countrey. Samothes therfore now entred into his own kingdome with his wife, children, and followers, and also his horses, kine, and other things necessarie, began to settle himselfe therein, and to give out edicts and breefe commaunds what he would have done and performed in this his coun∣trey: which was done in the yeare after the floud above written, and about two thousand fourescore and thirteene yeares before the incarnation of our Lord Iesus Christ. The countrey was very much peopled by this time, and great encreases of all other things there were found upon his now comming (for it was now seven and thirty yeares past since Noe left people there first to inhabit and multi∣plie, which in such a time grew to great abundance of all things whatsoever.) His welcome and entertainement was wonderous gladly accepted of those people and men of the countrey, who acknowledged him as their Lord, their Patriarke, their cheefe, and their Saturne; which names in those daies were given as titles only of honor, excellence, and dignitie, as Zenophon in his Aequivocals also sayth: Saturni dicuntur familiarium nobilium regum, qui urbes condiderunt Primogeniti eorum, vocantur Ioves, & Iunones: vero Nepotes eorum Hercules fortissimi & cetera. It may now very well bee imagined, that those people having so long time lived without a governour, king, or particular commaunder, must of necessitie bee very rude,
uncivile, obstinat, and barbarous, living onely according to the lawes of Nature, and following their owne wils, de∣sires, and concupiscence. Yet notwithstanding, Samothes by faire and gentle demeanures & mild cariages, so woon their hearts unto him, that they became easily reclaimed, and brought to be docible and obedient to what precepts or commaunds were imposed upon them: and upon this hee devised lawes and ordinances for domesticke conver∣sation, which he caused to bee made plaine unto the peo∣ple, who at the first something wondered at so straunge al∣terations, having so many yeares together lived without any cheefe, or any lawes to curbe or bridle their naturall fantasies and disordinat affections. And these lawes were made in the fourth yeare of the raigne of Ninus, the third king of Babylon, at what time also Tuyscon the Gyant, his uncle, king of Almaigne, and Tuball king of Spaine, did the like, instructing their people very industriously in the rules of Philosophie, Physicke, and Astronomie, which they themselves had learned of their grandfather Noe and their father Iaphet. And if it bee here demaunded, what kind of writings they then used, Berosas doth answere, that they were certaine Phoenician characters & letters (which also were used in Armenia) which were very like unto those which Cadmus long time after brought from Phoe∣nicia into Greece, and therefore Iulius Caesar in his sixt booke of Commentaries sayth, That the Gaules did use in those times Greeke letters for their manner of writing: but undoubtedly, those characters were found long time before they were ever knowne in Greece, as Zenophon and many other authors confidently doe affirme. Samothes, surnamed Dis, living thus in all tranquilitie
and peaceable securitie among his people, ceased not dayly to possesse their hearts with strong opinions of the worth and value of learning, for it is written, that hee was the wisest and most learned prince in the world in those times, as Berosus also alloweth, when he thus sayth: Samothes, qui & Dis vocatur, Celtas colonias fun∣davit, nec erat quis etate illa isto sapientior, ac propterea Samothes dictus est. Among other his rules of Philosophie and learning, one was (beeing the cheefest) hee taught the people, That the soules of men were immortall; which before they hardly beleeved, as men dwelling in the shade of igno∣rance, and invelloped with darke mists of errour. After he had thus established lawes and ordinances for the good governement of his country, and all his people enjoying peaceably the fruits of quietnesse: after the end of seven and fortie yeares, he rendered up unto Nature that debt which could not be any longer kept backe and detained; and left his eldest sonne (called Magus) inherit or unto his kingdome and governement, which was in the one and fiftieth yeare of the raigne of Nynus the third king of Ba∣bylon, and when his father Samothes had commaunded that countrey sevenscore & five yeares, being at his death about three hundred yeares of age, or much thereabout. This Samothes was of that esteeme in those dayes, and so generally reverenced and loved for his vertues through all that countrey, that the Gaulois or Frenchmen, even unto the time of Iulius Caesar, boasted and gloried of no∣thing so much, as that they were descended and issued
from him, so highly was he possest of the peoples hearts, in the greatest opinion of truest love, the which thing also Iulius Caesar in the sixt booke of his Commentaries more copiously remembreth. In his time also the sects of Phi∣losophie first tooke their beginning and originall in Eu∣rope, and were called Samothees, which were men studied and expert in all letters, humane and divine; contrarie to the opinion of many, who write, that Greece was the first mother and bringer forth of arts and sciences. But Dio∣genes Laertius, in the beginning of his booke entituled, The lives of the Philosophers, contradicteth those sup∣positions, saying: Philosophiam à Barbaris initia sumpsisse complures auctores asserunt, constat enim apud Persas claru∣isse Magos, apud Babilonios & Assirios floruisse Caldeos, apud Celtas & Gallos Druidas, & qui Samothei dicuntur. Magus, the eldest sonne of the Patriarke and Saturne, Samothes surnamed Dis, began now to take upon him the rule and commaund of this his countrey so left unto him by rightfull succession from his father, in the three hun∣dred yeare after the floud, after the nativitie of the Patri∣arke Abraham eight yeares, and before the birth of Christ two thousand and seventeene yeares. This Magus was a prince of great wisedome, learning and judgement, and also a great builder, as the interpretation of his name delivereth us: for this word Magus, in the Scythian toung signifieth a builder or erecter; and in the Persian language, a Philosopher or a wise man. And Berosus in his booke of Time thus sayth of him: Nini LI. anno, apud Celtas regna∣vit Samothis filius Magus, à quo oppida plurima posita sunt in ea regione: by which it may be gathered, that hee was the first that ever in that country caused any villages, cities
townes or houses to bee built and erected, for before that time men lived altogether in the fields, under the umbra∣ges of trees and covertures of some pleasant groves. Io∣hannes Annius di Viterba in his Commentaries upon Berosus, sayth, That this word Magus signifieth in that tongue which first was used in that countrey of Gaule, as much, as a pallace, house, or mansion: which opinion challengeth unto it selfe the stronger probabilitie, for that with Ptolomie in his Cosmographie you shall find; that most of the most auncient townes in that country ended with this word Magus: as in Aquitaine, Noviomagus; in the province of Lyons, Neomagus; in Gallia Belgica, Rhotomagus, which is now the citie of Roan in Norman∣die: there is also Berbetomagus, Vindomagus, and many others, whose names doe end in this word Magus; as also Nimegham in Guelderland, was called likewise Novio∣magus. By all these instances it is made apparent, that this Magus, the sonne of Samothes,Magus king of Fraunce the first that ever built townes in that coun∣try, and cau∣sed them to be inhabited was the first that reduced & gathered together the people of that countrey into villa∣ges, townes, and boroughs. And further, either of his life, or the certaine time or continuance of his raigne and go∣vernement, it hath not been by any allowed author or an∣cient writer capitulated. After Magus, succeeded one of his sons called Sarron,Sarron king of Fraunce, the first foū∣der of Vni∣versities. the third king of Fraunce, who excelled in the studie of letters, and governed his people with great mildnes, cle∣mencie, and uprightnesse; and he was the first that erected universities or publicke schooles of learning: and of him also came a sect of Philosophers called Sarronides, as Dio∣dorus Siculus in his sixt booke of Antiquities affirmeth, thus saying: Sunt apud Celtas Theologi, ac Philosophi quos
vocant Sarronidas, qui precipue ab eis coluntur, nam moris est apud illos nullum absque Philosopho sacrificium facere, &c. For in those daies Philosophers and men of learning were regarded with great reverence, zeale, and gracious respect; and nothing there, of any import was concluded or agreed upon without their privities consent or aduise therein. Vnto the kingdome of Fraunce after Sarron, came Drijus, Sarrons eldest sonne, unto whom Berosus ascribeth this title: Apud Celtas Drijus peritiae plenus. Hee began to raigne foure hundred and tenne yeares after the generall deluge, which was about two hundred five & fiftie yeares after the first foundation and inhabitation of the king∣dome of Fraunce. Hee was deepely seene in principles of Philosophie, & very skilfull in many other sciences. And it is very credibly delivered by many very grave and lear∣ned writers, that he built the cittie of Dreux in Norman∣die, and that of his name came the sect of Philosophers, which were called Druydes, which were wondrous lear∣ned Divines, Augurers, Magicians, and Sacrificers: but such their oblations and sacrifices in these their dayes of blindnesse, were performed with such inhumane and un∣godly fashions, with the effusion and shedding of human bloud in that lamentable and cruell manner, as is too straunge to be reported: which unnaturall and impious custome, was abolished and cleane put downe by the first Romane Emperours, Augustus, and Divus Claudius, as Suetonius Tranquilius, Iulius Caesar, and Plinie, more directly have particularized the same. After the death of this king Drijus, his sonne (called Bardus) raigned in his place, & was the fift king of France. This Bardus was the first deviser and inventor of rimes,
songs, and Musicke, of whome the Poets and Rhethorici∣ans first tooke their sect, which were called also Bardes,Bardus king of Fraunce first invētor of Poetrie. as Diodorus Siculus in his sixt booke more at large remem∣breth. And these Poets and singers were held in that re∣verenced regard in those times among those people, that if upon the instant encounter of the battels of the ene∣mies on both parts, these Poets had stept and put them∣selves in betweene both the armies, they had for that pre∣sent time recalled their furious intendments, and beene mollified with the pleasant persuasive tongues of these eloquent Rhethoricians and sweet-singing Poets, as Bero∣sus in one place sayth to the same purpose: Etiam apud agrestiores barbaros ira cedit sapientiae & Mars reveretur musas. The debt due unto Nature being fully satisfied by this king Bardus (for no quillit or evacuation whatsoever may avoid it) his eldest sonne called Longho was called upon to undertake that which his father had left hereditarie unto him: of whome, no extraordinarie memorable thing is left by fame unto the sonnes of time, nor any authoritie of any great antiquarie possesseth us with his worthinesse vertues or perfections: it is only supposed, that before his death he built the citie of Langres, which we call in Latin Civitas Lingonensis. And hee had a sonne called Bardus the younger, which was the seventh king of Fraunce, and began to commaund some three hundred and one and fortie yeares after the foundation and enpeopling of this countrey of Fraunce. And it is very probable, That of these two kings Longho and Bardus, the first originall and beginning of the people called Lombards took their be∣ing and name, for they are entearmed in Latine Longo∣bardi,
which nation, although at the first they were extra∣cted and descended out of Almaign (now called Germa∣nie) yet they bare domination and rule for the space of two hundred yeares and more in Italie, even untill the time of king Charlemaine, who absolutely deprived them of all commaund, power, and authoritie in that countrey round about. The eight king of Fraunce, was Lucus, the sonne of Bardus the younger, of whom it is written (as Ptolomy and others doe affirme) the people called Luces or Lucenses (since inhabiting about the cittie of Paris) tooke their name and originall. Of him also, writers have beene very sparing to speake of, more than that hee begat a son called Iupiter Celtes, the ninth king of Fraunce, and father to the faire and beautious gyantesse Galathea, whom before wee so largely spoke of and remembred. And it is by compu∣tation and due reckoning found, that since the first Saturn and king of Fraunce called Samothes surnamed Dis, unto the raign of Iupiter Celtes, were about four hundred years. And now having thus lineally drawne the succession of every king of this countrey, since the first inhabitation thereof untill this Iupiter Celtes, and so consequently unto his sonne in law, Hercules of Lybia, now the tenth king of Fraunce; we will proceed with him (now employed about his affaires in Italie) and with his issue and posteritie, as it is delivered by authours of great worth, learning, and au∣thoritie. It hath been before somewhat touched, how Hercules passing through those mountainous places of the coun∣trey of Savoy, at length arrived in Italie, where (having a puissant armie) hee presently fell to wars with the Gyants
called Lestrigones, most bloudie, cruell, and oppressive ty∣rants, and the murderers or consenting aidants unto the death of his father Osyris (surnamed Iupiter Iustus.) With these powerfull commaunders in that countrey, he enter∣tained many fights, and found them very resolute, & pre∣pared to endure the uttermost of his mightinesse and strength: yet in the end, after a ten yeares wars he victori∣ously triumphed over them, and utterly razed out all their issue and posteritie whatsoever: and the place wherein his last battell against these Gyants, was fought in, retaineth still his old name, and is yet called, The valley of the Gy∣ants; which is hard adjoyning unto the cittie called Tus∣canella in Tuscania. These civile & intestine broiles being thus valiantly and successefully appeased, Hercules remai∣ned a quiet and peaceable possessor of all the countrey of Italie, wherein he raigned and continued for the space of twenty yeares, much about the time that his father Osyris, his grandfather Cham, and his great grandfather Noe, had there commaunded: in which time hee bestowed many gracious and commodious good turnes upon the people of that countrey, and built and erected many gallant and famous cities, although the most part of them bee at this day by the all consuming tyrannie of Time ruinated, spoi∣led, and decayed. He also at this time caused the Island of Sardinia to be peopled, frequented, and inhabited, which untill that time lay wast, depopulate, and barbarous: and in this place hee appointed a ruler called Iolaus to com∣maund as under him, that countrey, and those people so committed unto him. Hee likewise caused through most part of Italie (especially in the moorish & wettest places thereof) many ditches and trenches to bee cast up, that
thereby the palludious meres and standing lakes, might find passages to emptie their flouds, and that the fields and bastures by that meanes might be preserved drie, and be made more fit for agriculture, tillage, and other neces∣sarie encreases for the generall profit and good of all the whole countrey thereabouts: and of him the river Arnus taketh name, for Hercules was also surnamed Musarnus: and he lived for the most part of the time that he spent in that countrey, in a cittie called Fesula in Tuscania, which citie even at this day (though not in that glory as hereto∣fore) giveth the armes of Hercules. Italie being thus freed from the servitude wherein it lived of those ungodly and uncivile Gyants, and beeing now brought to a generall quietnesse, ease, and prospe∣rous estate, Hercules determined with himselfe to send for both of his eldest sonnes, to establish the one in the prin∣cipalitie of Italie, & the other in the kingdome of France; and hee to take his journey once againe into Spaine (to which countrey hee was much addicted) there to live pri∣vately, and to spend the rest of his yeares to come, in peace pleasantnesse, and in all content. Whereupon hee dispat∣ched messengers to his wife Galathea (then remaining in Fraunce, as hath been before spoken of) to send him pre∣sently his sonne Galatheus, being now of mans estate, and very able to beare armes. Other messengers were dispat∣ched into Scythia (now called Tartaria) there to seek out his eldest sonne Tuscus, then remaining with the queene Araxa, queene of Scythia, inhabiting those countries which lie upon the floud Tanais, and by the moores and water-lakes called Meotides. Vpon the commandement of king Hercules, Galathea his wife presently sent unto
him his son Galatheus into Italie, accompanied with the greatest men of Fraunce, who was very joyously welcom∣med unto his father with great feasts and signes of glad∣nesse: for he was now growne up unto a gallant big pro∣portion of bodie and comely feature, and was also of a very gentle and gracious disposition, mild in his demea∣nures, and yet majesticall and of a spirit-promising aspect, throughout all his countenance. Not long after him arri∣ved his elder brother Tuscus from Tartaria, who also was of a mightie corpulencie and extraordinarie large sta∣ture, whom indeed Hercules had begot in the very prime of his youth and vigorous lustinesse. Vpon the meeting of these two, a great court or assembly of great lords and princes was held in all pompe, glorie, and magnificence: where, in the presence of all the noble Lords and Barons of diverse countries and governments, as of Aegypt, Lybia (now called Affrica) Spaine, Fraunce, Italie, and Tartaria, with great solemnities, rites, and ceremonies, Tuscus was created and established the sole king, Saturne, and com∣maunder of all the countrey of Italie, and hee was there invested in the dignitie of Ceritus, that is as much to say, as Iupiter crowned, or Patriarke of Tuscania: & the yonger brother Galatheus, aged about six and thirtie yeares or thereabouts, was preferred also at that time unto the rule and governement of the kingdome of Fraunce. All which ceremonies were performed with great triumph, state, and royaltie, and kept in the citie of Viterba, in the yeare after the universall inundation of the world, six hundred and five and twentie, before the foundation of Troy ninescore and one yeares, and before the incarnation of Christ a thousand six hundred fortie eight. These things thus so∣lemnely
consummated, and Hercules voluntarily dispos∣sessing himselfe of these two such imperiall crowns. After he had delivered some instructions & principles of good government to these new erected kings, Tuscus and Gala∣theus, after a generall conge of them all, he took his jour∣ney towards Spaine, to the great discontent and greese of all the cheefe Barons, and also of the Plebeians, through∣out all the countrey of Italie: but beeing now arrived in Spaine, he found his son Hspalus, which hee himselfe had before established in that kingdome, to be dead, who had reigned onely seventeene yeares: and that after him suc∣ceeded his nephew Hispanus, the seventeenth king of Spaine, and the first of that name, who called the country after his owne name, Hispania, which name it ever since hath retained: for before that time it was called Hberia. This Hispanus raigned afterwards some two and thirtie yeares or neare thereabouts, as most writers and Crono∣graphers of Spaine doe agree. And in this kings raigne, about the nineteenth yeare thereof (as is before written) arrived Hercules in that countrey, now very aged, and of many yeares, where hee continued three yeares with his nephew, without any command or place, in as great con∣tent, ease, and quiet as might bee, for hee had now given over the desire of rule and principalitie, and gloried in nothing so much, as that he by his owne valour, prowesse, and labours, had conquered such gallant countries to dis∣pose of as hee himselfe thought good, and to give to his children to enjoy as their rightful inheritances: for indeed hee was the Monarch and prince almost of all the world, and had attained unto such his height of glorie and fame, not by oppressions, tyrannie, or unlawfulnesse, but by the
subduing of wicked and ungodly gyants, the deposing of all usurpers and bloudie governours, & by the abolishing and rooting out of all divellish and inhumane customes then observed in those daies among the poore and faith-wanting vulgars in those times of error. In these his times of privatenesse and retired living which he spent in Spain, he builded and caused to bee erected many great townes, citties, and villages; for which cause the people of that countrey still call him Hercules the builder. Besides this, also hee gave and addicted himselfe to the finding out of the natures of strange hearbs, and to the studie of Astro∣nomie, and the Magicke art, where in he wondrous deeply was seene, and excellently well read; but hee never applied the use thereof but unto the good and generall commo∣ditie of the countrey. Hee found out many remedies and enchauntments against the poyson of serpents and many other venomous beasts, then abounding in that countrie in great plentie, and by which the inhabitants before were greevously molested and exceedingly troubled. Hee also performed there many other memorable things of great worth, value, and import, as Higinus and many other very learned writers doe affirme. Not long after, his nephew Hispanus, king of Spaine, died without issue, & left none of his owne bloud to inherite the kingdome after him: whereupon by the generall entreatie of all the whole land, and by publicke consent, the command and government of that countrey was imposed upon Hercules, whome the people for his vertues, faire demeanures, and good go∣vernment, did indeed very highly affect and reverence: and here (having so fit an occasion to speake of the ori∣ginall and antiquitie of this countrey of Spaine) wee will
for a while leave him, undertaking the charge once again and the commaund and governement thereof: and we will begin with the first king of Spaine, and so by succession and lineall descent from one to another, as far as Berosus, Eusebius, Solynus, and Diodorus Siculus have proceeded therein, and untill wee come to the raigne of this Her∣cules. The very first inhabitation and peopling of this coun∣trey of Spaine, was by those people that came from the other side of the Caspian sea, called Iberi, Persae, Pheni∣ces, and Paeni, as Plinie in the third booke of his naturall hystorie doth alleadge; as also Marcus Varro, and Cato in his originals doe affirme the same; wholly condemning the Grecians of vaine glorie and ignorance, to write, that Hercules, Pirenes, Lusus, and Pan were the first that ever inhabited in this countrey: but of the colonies therefore of those people before mentioned, it is very certain, that Spaine took first her originall, as also those other Islands round about, is called Sicilia, Corsica, Sardinia, and Ba∣leares: and the Island Corsica was so called of the people Corsi, which the Grecians tearme Cyrnum or Cyrum, but the Persians and Hebrewes Corsum: and after these people, the Gothes and Alani came and lived in Spaine long time, and continued for the most part of them untill this very present wherein wee now live, from whome and from the rest before mentioned, it is delivered for cer∣taine by many auncient, grave, and learned writers, this countrey of Spain deriveth her first beginning and prin∣cipall foundation. S. Ierome, Eusebius, Iosephus, and many other approved good authors, doe all consent and agree, That Tuball the
fift sonne of Iaphet, the son of Noe, was the first that ever was called by the name of king in that country of Spain, and that he was also the first that erected & built townes and cities, and prescribed bounds and limits in the same; which as Berosus sayth, was after the floud a hundred three and fortie yeares, and in the twelfth yeare of the raigne of Nembroth, the Babylonians Saturne and ruler; which was before the foundation of Troy six hundred thirtie seven yeares, and before the nativitie of Christ two thousand two hundred yeares. The great citie which he called after his owne name (Tuball) is in Baetica, as Pomponius Mela affirmeth, as also Strabo averreth the same. This kings cheefe studie and delight was in pasturage, in flockes of sheepe, and heards of cattell, wherein in those times men reposed great contentment, pleasure, and felicitie: & such his studie the people (called Arameans) entearmed by the name of Tharaconem, which is as much to say, as Pasto∣rum congreationem, The meeting together or assembly of sheepeheards, as S. Ierome and the Thalmudists of the Iewes interprets it: and of the same the great citie of Tha∣racona is called, as Saguntum first tooke her name of Sagus, the builder and erecter thereof. He began also first to set downe lawes, precepts, and directions unto his peo∣ple, and to possesse them with the opinion of good obe∣dience unto their prince, and persuaded them by fair and gentle meanes to the embracement of a civile and quiet life and conversation: and this, Berosus saith was perfor∣med and done in the fourth yeare of Ninus king of Baby∣lon, as before in some places hath been a little remembe∣red: and Strabo sayth, That in the tenth yeare of the same Ninus king of Babylon, and in the age of Tuball one hun∣dred
and fifteene yeares, Noe (surnamed Ianus) comming out of Affrica and Phoenicia, arrived in Spain, & brought thither with him two colonies, called Nooelas and Nooe∣glas; although Plinie in his third booke of naturall hysto∣rie, in the six and twentieth chapter thereof calleth them Nooegas and Nooelas: and in this countrey were they planted, and remained with great multiplication, encrease and abundance. This Tuball raigned in this his governe∣ment, untill the nine and fortieth yeare of the raigne of Ninus, and from the first inhabitation of Spain a hundred and five and fiftie yeares:The Patri∣arke Abra∣ham borne. and in this kings governement was the Patriarke Abraham borne, which was just by all nearest computation, towards the end of his raigne, and in the foure and fortieth yeare of the before specified Ninus king of Babylon. Vnto Tuball succeeded his sonne called Iberus, in the government and kingdome which he had left him to en∣joy: which was from the floud two hundred ninetie & nine yeares, from the first enpeopling of Spain a hundred fiftie six, before the erection of Troy five hundred thirtie and one, and before the birth of Christ two thousand and six∣teene yeares.Marcus Varro. And of this Iberus (as Marcus Varro allead∣geth) the countrey was generally called Iberia, as it was af∣terwards Celtiberia, of certaine people called Celtes, in∣habiting long after in Fraunce, as many authentike hy∣storians doe affirme: and of this king also the river Iberus tooke her name,Solynus. and was so called. This floud, as Solynus, Albertus Magnus, and Diodorus Siculus averre, beginneth his first Spring, and taketh his head under the hils called Montes Pyrenaei, which lately before we remembred, and from thence runs winding and crooked like the shape of a
serpent or snake through the promontorie of Feraria, and so tumbleth downe amaine into the sea called Pelagus Beleare. And this king Iberus raigned untill the three and thirtieth yeare of the rule of Semiramis, which is about seven and thirtie yeares or much thereabouts, as Eusebius accounteth it. The third king of Spaine, according to the opinion of most hystorians, was Iubalda, of whose name the hill cal∣led Iubalda, was so called, as Berosus affirmeth, although in Ptolomie it is written Iubeda,Ptolomie. and by the successions of times, corruptibly Gybaltar, by which name at this time the countrey doth acknowledge it. This Iubalda began to enter into his kingdome in the foure and thirtieth year of the raign of Semiramis: from the worlds inundation three hundred thirtie six, from the birth of the holy Patriarke Abraham foure and fortie, from the first inhabitation of Spain two hundred wanting seven years, before the buil∣ding of Troy foure hundred fourescore and foure yeares, and before the birth of our Saviour Christ one thousand nine hundred fourescore and one yeares. And in this kings raigne the ever-famoused Hercules of Lybia was borne, which was before the birth of the Grecian Hercules, of whom so many grave authors have written and beene de∣ceived, almost seven hundred yeares: of the difference of which, because it hath bred such an incurable skar of error among very learned and old writers, I think it shall not be much impertinent in this place something to particula∣rize. Of the number therefore of those men which were called by the name of Hercules,Varro. Varro and many other au∣thors alleadge to bee at the least three and fortie severall names, but the most famous & renowmed were only two,
of which, the first and most worthie was called Egiptius Thebanus, or Hercules Licicus; the second, Alcaeus Graecus, the son of Alcmena and Amphitrio, as Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, and many others affirme, who report also, That there was a temple in Phoenicia built and dedicated unto the first Hercules many years before the comming of this Hercules Graecus, the son of Amphitrio, and that also long after both these two (with the ancient Grecians) were held and worshipped in great reverence and adoration; but the one of them, being Hercules Egiptius (say they) was adored as a god, the other but as a mightie and famous conque∣rour. Cicero in his booke entituled de natura Deorum, set∣teth downe this Hercules also as a god, as Macrobius also and many others have opinionated the same. Diodorus Siculus in his first booke confidently alleadgeth, That this Hercules Graecus had not to name Hercules, which signifies heartie, but that his proper name was Alceus and also He∣raclius, which interpreted, signifies Iunonis gloria: which opinion likewise Herodotus consenteth with, when in his second booke of hystories hee affirmeth, that this word Hercules is not a Greeke word, but of the Aegyptian lan∣guage, and that the Grecians afterwards stole it from the right owner thereof, and unworthily attributed it unto this Alceus, the sonne of Amphitrio: which thing also Eu∣sebius maintaineth, and sayth, That those famous and gal∣lant exploits wherewith the world was so long possessed, and caried such universall admirations among all men, were misplaced and bestowed on a straunger, that came not neare the true merit and worthinesse of him whom it truly concerned; thereby cleane exempting & excepting this Alceus (Amphitrios sonne) from all interrest or right
unto any these so high and wonder-worthy performances, as only particular and belonging unto this noble Hercu∣les Egiptius or Libicus, the sonne of Osyris, called Iupiter Iustus (as Diodorus Siculus, Berosus, & Moyses also, certain∣ly doe report.) Vnto him also the people of Lybia conse∣crated many triumphes, ceremonious observances, and generall feasts, as one for his valour and vertues honored and worshipped amongst them as a mighty and powerful god: so were they blinded from the true sight and under∣standing of knowledge, in those times of darknesse, error, and superstition. And these people were first called Phutei or Phaetontei, as Iosephus and Iheronimus in his tenth chapter upon the booke of Genesis affirmeth. Vnto this Hercules of Lybia were adjoyned also all these names (ac∣cording to the Aegyptian tongue) Her, Hercol, Arno, Mu∣sarno, and Ar; of which, hereafter occasion will present it selfe, further to expound, and more largely to speake of: but it is most unfallibly certaine, that this Hercules Egipti∣us or Libicus, was long before the times of the so much renowmed Hercules of Greece: who indeed according to the writings of very many grave and learned authors, de∣served not the least part of so many glorious praises and titles of honour, as the flattering and selfe-pleasing con∣ceits of the Grecians have so amply and prodigally as∣cribed unto him: for he is by many authors set downe no other but a very pyrate on the sea, a robber and bloudie oppressor, where he could find out any bootie or advaun∣tage to shew his power, wil, and mightinesse; much unlike the proceedings that victorious and vertuous conqueror Hercules of Lybia: to approve which to be no detraction, but memorious notes of forepassed learned writers, Ma∣nethon
that famous Priest and Hystorian of Aegypt, thus sayth: Constat hunc Herculem Graecum dolo non bello Lau∣medontem nil eiusmodi, suspicantem occidisse, & primum ex maximis piratis extitisse, quanquam virum divino & admi∣rabilirobore preditum, &c. Whereby it is very apparent by this authoritie and many others of like worth and anti∣quitie, that this Hercules the Grecian was but some fa∣mous robber or pyrate, living for the most part among the Argonauts, men excelling in warlicke discipline, and armed with armours of yron and other like furnitures for the wars, as Eusebius sayth: Hercules Alceus affuit domito jam orbe, & legibus & regibus formato, & instituto, & for∣midoloso ferro invento: wheras contrariwise, Hercules Egip∣tius lived in times of ignorance, in respect of those know∣ledges, when the use of armour or yron was unfound out, the furie of warre not then felt, and in times of new-rising tumults, not as then ripened or growne to any head or maturitie. His armour was the skins of wild beasts, and such like accoustrements was he habited with: which also is attributed unto Hercules Alceus, as having a Lions skin and a great club in his hands, but they are among the rest of the fables which the Grecians used, inserted: for it is nothing likely, that the use of yron beeing in those times found out, he would have used any such inferiour meanes of defence for the safetie of his bodie. This assertion also maketh cleane contrarie against him: for Hercules of Ly∣bia was borne before the destruction of Troy (according to the computation of the Aegyptian yeares) above tenne thousand yeares, but Alceus not fully two thousand, as Di∣odorus in his first booke of Time alleadgeth: which man∣ner of computation and reckoning of the Aegyptians, if
we wil reduce to the order and rule observed by the Chal∣deans, Scythians, Hebrewes, and Ianigenae, which is by the circular circumference and revolution of the Sunne, accounting it as we now reckon, we shall find, that he was borne presently after the king of Babylon called Ninus, which is according to our latter observation, some eight hundred yeares before the overthrow and ruine of Troy; which maketh up the number & proportion of ten thou∣sand yeares, held and observed among the Aegyptians: by which we may perceive the great distance of time that was betweene these two famous personages, Hercules E∣giptius or Libicus, the sonne of Osyris, surnamed Iupiter Iu∣stus, and Hercules Graecus or Alceus (or as some hold) the son of Amphitrio and Alcmena: or the son (by adulterous meanes) as some others doe thinke, of one called Iupiter Graecus. But having now thus farre digressed from the maine entendement, wee will returne to the prosecuting thereof. The continuance of the raigne of the above written Iubalda, king of Spaine, dured from the foure and thirtith yeare of the raigne of Semiramis, the Babylonian Em∣presse, untill the eighteenth yeare of Arius; which is in the whole about the time of threescore and foure yeares, as by the diligent & carefull collections both of Eusebius and Berosus, is clearely approoved. And about this time (the Patriarke Abraham, beeing about the age of a hun∣dred yeares) is borne his son Isaack,Isaack born. as all hystories for the most part give record and mention. In the governement of this king Iubalda, no memorable act done in that coun∣trey, is left written by hystorians. Vnto the kingdome of Spaine, next after him, succee∣ded
Brygus, which was in the eighteenth yeare of the late specified Arius, the Babylonians sixt king; which is from the first inhabitation of Spaine, two hundred threescore and seven yeares, and before the foundation of Troy four hundred and thirtie. This word Brygus with the Arame∣ans and Armenians, is called Castellum. And the Etrusci∣ans at this day (with whome many words of the Aramen language remaine) call a castle Bricola, by changing the letter g into c. This king Brygus (as Berosus & other writers affirme) founded and erected many townes and great ca∣stles in the kingdome of Spaine, as Ptolomie also copiou∣sly hath delivered; as in the countrey of Lusitania, there are castles called at this day Laccobryga, Mirobryga, and others. And in the province of Taracona, a towne called Brygantum, Volubryga, and many others, sounding and ending after the name of the king Brygus. Plinie sayth in his fift booke of naturall hystorie,Plinie. that many old writers do affirme, That a certain people called Brygi in Europe travelled into Asia, and there builded a citie and called it Brygios, which afterwards by chaunging the letter B into P, was called Phrygios; and that the Phrygians afterwards from these people tooke their first originall and being, of whome issued that famous progenie of the Trojanes, so gloriously renowmed throughout the world: and this king Brygus reigned in all securitie and peace untill the first yeare of the reigne of Balaneus, the eight king of Ba∣bylon, which was about two and fiftie yeares or near ther∣abouts. The fift king of Spaine was Tagus (as Berosus and Dio∣dorus deliver) and he began his rule and government be∣fore the nativitie of Christ a thousand eight hundred
threescore and five yeares, before the building of Troy threescore and eighteene yeares, after the first peopling of Spaine three hundred and nine yeares. And of this kings name that far-famed river Tagus taketh her name: in which (as Plinie and Solynus report) were found many golden sands, heaped together in many places of that ri∣ver. This king with many authours is called also Tagum Orma, and Moyses by synoereicall composition, tearmeth him Tagorma, as Ptolomie and many other writers of great worth and credite, more particularly have spoken of the same: and this Tagus reigned in the kingdome of Spain, about the time of thirtie yeares, by all due computation and conferring of consent of times, and as Berosus affir∣meth the same. In the first yeare of the reigne of Armatritis the ninth king of the Babylonians and Assyrians, the rule and go∣vernement of the kingdome of Spaine fell and came un∣to Betus, of whom afterwards a great part of that country tooke her name, and was knowne by the name of Baetica. The Etruscians by transposition and division of ae, cal him Beatus, which with the Latines signifies happie or blessed. The Hebrewes derive this word Betus from Behin, which as S. Ierome interprets it, meaneth as much as, locus vitae meae (id est) foelic tatis ptatae: and from hence it is likely, that in this countrey some supposed the Elesian fields to be, and so also thereby many other such like suppositions arose, which to decide, would here bee tedious, and too much digression from the matter entended. This king Be∣tus raigned seven and thirtie yeares, as Berosus and other authors doe alleadge. After him in the eight and thirtith yeare of Armatritis
above mentioned, Gerion (surnamed Aser) challenged un∣to him the rule and domination of the countrey of Spain: wherein it is written, he governed with great tyrannie and oppression of the inhabitants thereof, intruding himselfe by violent and forcible means into the possession and go∣vernement of that kingdome. This word Gerion signifies in the Hebrew tongue as much as advena in Latin, which he manifested more plainely by comming from Maurita∣nia into this kingdome of Spaine, and ruling there like a straunger, according to his owne will, desire, and mighti∣nesse. Berosus, as also Diodorus Siculus, doth affirme, That he had another name also, which in the Aramen & Mau∣ritanian language was Deabo, in the Greeke Chryseo, in Latine Aureo, which first of all came of his great wealth and store of gold, in which he most wonderously aboun∣ded in those daies: and this Gerion reigned thus in this his usurped authoritie untill the eight and twentith yeare of the raigne of Belochus, the tenth king and ruler of Ba∣bylonia, which was about the time of three & thirtie years or near therabouts. Immediatly after him, three brethren together tooke the rule and government of this countrey of Spaine into their hands, which were called Deabi Lom∣nimi, which word (as S. Ierome expoundeth it) signifieth the cheefes or rulers of armies, and which wee call by the name of the three Gerions, beeing indeed the sons of the beforementioned Gerion, the last king and ruler of Spain. In the time when these three brethren thus reigned and ruled together, happened that generally known accident, which afterward the world so universally entertained from the report of loud-tongued Fame, which was, the untime∣ly and unfortunat death of Osyris, surnamed Iupiter Iustus;
who was most traiterously and vilely murdred by his bro∣ther Typhaeus Egiptius, whose all-lamented death was after∣ward highly revenged by his sonne Hercules Lybicus, who instantly took up armes, and scoured almost all the coun∣tries of the world, untill hee had found out the authour of the murther of his father Osyris, upon whose bodie, his angrie and wrathfull mind tooke in the end direfull and cruell revenge: at which time also (hee beeing in the pride and fulnesse of furie and choller) searcht out all corners and places of abode, where any such like bloudie and im∣pious gyants, rulers, and commaunders, kept their tyran∣nicall and uncivile governments: among the rest, he slew Busyris in Phoenicia, Typhaeus the younger in Phrygia, Mylinus, a great commaunder on the sea in Crete, An∣theus in Lybia, the Lestrigones in Italie, and afterwards, these three bretheren called Geriones in Spaine, and also many others in many other places, as hath alreadie here∣tofore beene spoken of. After the overthrow thus of these late specified Geriones, hee established and appointed to succeed them one called Hispalus, who now after these, in∣stantly tooke upon him the government thereof. Hispalus therefore (according to the report and affir∣mation of Berosus) now entered to take possession of the regaltie and principalitie of Spaine, which was from the floud five hundred fourescore and nine yeares, before the erection of Troy two hundred one & fortie years, before the birth of Christ a thousand seven hundred twentie se∣ven, and after the first finding out and peopling of Spain three hundred seven and fortie yeares. Of this Hispalus, the citie Hispalis first was erected and so entearmed, and he was the sonne of Hercules Lybicus, as many authours
and writers of fame and great antiquitie have given in re∣port unto the posteritie of time. Hee reigned and com∣maunded over Spaine untill the very end of the reigne and governement of Baleus, the Babylonians eleventh king which was by just reckoning and account, the time of seventeene yeares. In the first yeare of the raigne of Altades, the twelfth king of Babylonia, Hispanus the nephew of Hercules, was established king and sole ruler over the dominions of Spaine, of whome the countrey then generally was called Hispania, which the mallice of time hath not yet worne out, but still it is knowne and called after the same name. After him, Hercules (comming out of Italie, fraught with yeares and many victories) tooke upon him by the electi∣on and suffrages of all the people, the rule & government thereof. And thus hath been lineally drawne foorth the first inhabitation of the countrey of Spaine with the par∣ticular and right successions of the kings and commaun∣ders thereof, as hath been warranted and allowed by wri∣ters of great antiquitie and industrious Chronographers of Spain: where we will now surcease to wade any further, having brought it unto the very times where wee last left our cheefe purpose and matter; and will goe forward, and proceed from hence untill wee shall nearer arrive at the time wherein Troy was first erected and founded, following herein the same manner of method and forme, with which wee first set forth, and meane to continue unto the end (by the favourable permission and allowance of the divine Majestie.) Hercules therefore ruling thus in Spaine, built and erected many goodly cities and faire castles in that countrey, wherupon at this day in some auncient re∣cords
and monumentall schedules of Spaine, you may read of another title given unto him, which is, Hercules edificator. He was called also by these names, as Her, Her∣col, Arno, Musarno: and they thus signifie and are en∣glished from the Hebrew tongue, as S. Ierome and others expound it: Her signifieth hairie, Hercol all covered over with haire, Arno signifieth a Lion, and Musarno the por∣traiture or effigies of a Lyon, and these names were thus ascribed unto him, for that he alwaies wore for his upper garment the hairie skins of Lyons, Beares, Leopards, and other such like beasts, and for that on his shield or tar∣guet was depainted and drawne the shape and forme of a Lyon, and which, in all his wars and attempts hee alwaies caried about him: & with some he was called the knight of the ramping Lyon. The town of Vetulonia, called also Viterbe, caused the picture of Hercules to bee stamped and imprinted on their coine: which continued unto the time of the raigne and governement of the last king of the Lumbards, who then abollished the remembrance therof by any such representation or means of memorie. After the time of some nineteene yeares or thereabouts, as most writers doe alleadge, having governed with all love and obedience of the people, Hercules died, leaving all those countries thereabouts heavily lamenting the losse and departure of so noble and gallant a conqueror; which was about the time of his owne age three hundred and fiftie yeares, and after he had reigned and commaun∣ded in Fraunce, Italie, and Spaine, threescore and seven yeares. In solemne remembrance of whose generally deplored death, the people of Spaine erected many must sumptuous and costly monuments, and bestowed upon
him a wonderfull rich and stately tombe, which as some hold, was built hard by that place, which as wee now call them, the Gades, pillars, or columns of Hercules are seated upon, being not far from the famous streights of Gibral∣tar. Vnto him also after his death they attributed very godlike honors, and tearms of veneration and reverence; so was hee possessed while hee lived among mortals, with the love and opinion of all those people therabouts, and wheresoever else he had governed and commanded. And more of this so far renowmed conquerour Hercules shall not at this time bee declared, whose victories, triumphes, & exploits would indeed require a small volume of them∣selves, being so many, so glorious, & so worthie, deserving in the perfection of their owne merit to be insculpt in the brasse leaved booke of time-resisting and endlesse perpe∣tuitie. And now we will revert our pen to speake of his two famous sons, Tuscus king of Italie, and Galatheus king of Fraunce, and of their issue and posteritie. But first is to be understood, that unto the kingdome of Spaine next after Hercules, succeeded Hesperus, beeing the twelfth king and governor thereof, & who was brother unto the renoumed Atlas, whome hereafter occasion will bee presented to speake and entreat of. It hath been before declared and mentioned, how that the great Monarch and Emperour Hercules dispossessing himselfe voluntarily of two royall & mighty kingdomes, placed and instituted therein his two sons, Tuscus and Ga∣latheus: who long time after lived reciprocally, & reigned together in their severall commaunds and governement, in all peace, quiet, and tranquilitie. And to shew and ma∣nifest this their love and agreement the more, Tuscus
freely bestowed and gave unto his brother Galatheus the great Island of Sicilia, as then appertaining & belonging unto the crowne and kingdome of Italie, and which was then altogether desolate and disinhabited (the race and generation of Cham, Noes son, the first commander ther∣of, being now extinct and perished.) Vnto this Island, Ga∣latheus made a journey, carying with him great numbers and abundance of people, and all things necessary for the in peopling and inhabiting thereof: which people and na∣tion he afterwards and from thence forth called after his owne name Galath-enes; and erected and built also a very great citie there, calling it by the name of Cenegalatha, of which citie likewise, Plinie in his fourth booke of Natu∣rall hystorie doth there entreat and mention. And it was held in those daies to be the greatest and cheefest honour that might bee, to authorise and license any to build and erect any citie, and to call it after his owne name: for the denominating of which, no man neither could give any leave or authoritie, but those which were established in place and office of Coritus, that is, the Patriarke, Iupiter, or cheefe king and commander of that country, as Tuscus then was, being the sole king and ruler over all Italie and all those territories adjoyning thereunto. And this grace and favour Galatheus tooke in great thankefulnesse and all kind acceptance, endevouring by all means possible to be found gratefull for so high a favor received. After all mat∣ters were well setled and orderly disposed in this new ere∣cted governement of Sicilia, Galatheus returned backe againe into his countrey of Fraunce, where with all signs and apparent tokens of a long wished welcome, hee was joyfully received of his people in all the provinces round
about, where we must now leave him for a while, to speak of his brother Tuscus, and of his affaires and negotiations in his governement and charge. This Tuscus (as is before declared) was the sole and ab∣solute King, Patriarke, and Iupiter of all the dominions of Italie; of whose name also a cheefe province of that king∣dome then tooke her name, and was called Tuscania, and by the favourable good will of the tyrant Time (who is wont to blot out all reliques and tokens of antiquitie) it yet retaineth the same: in which particular countrey, hee for the most part made his continuall abode & residence, which before that time was called Etruria,The diverse and severall names of Italie. & before that, Ianicula, and the people thereof Ianigenes, which is as much to say, as the issue of Ianus: it was also called Oeno∣tria, Hesperia, Apenina, and many others, according to the greatnesse or will of any such cheefe or famous king so commaunding and ruling over it. Dionysius Halicarna∣saeus, writeth, That the countrey Hetruria (taken often∣times for the whole and entire kingdome of Italie) was also called Comera, of Comerus, Iaphets son; and it had to name also Razenua,It was also called Tauri∣na and Sa∣turnia. Thuscia, and Thussa, and at this day Italia, as hereafter shall be declared. Berosus further sayth, That at the first peopling and inhabiting thereof, it was called Vmbria of the people Vmbri, which heretofore we have somewhat touched, as also Pelasgia of the people Pelasgi (taken also sometimes for the inhabitants of a countrey in Greece.) Besides all these, it was also knowne by the name of Tarrhenia, as many authors of great and approved knowledge in matters of antiquitie, have more amply delivered, which opinion also should be more easi∣ly entertained, if wee will but diligently marke the diverse
and severall names given & attributed unto other coun∣tries, after the same fashion and manner: for first concer∣ning the people of Fraunce,The old names of the people of Fraunce. they were first of all called Samothei, of Samothes their king, then Celti, then Gala∣tij, after that Belgae, of their king and Patriarke Beligius, after that Galli, and since that Francigenae or Franci. The names in like manner of the people of Germanie varied and differed very often and severally:The names of the peo∣ple of Ger∣manie. For the first name that ever that people received, were Tuyscones, of Tuyscon one of Noes sonnes, the first that ever was king and ruler over that country. After that they were called Gambrivij, then Ingheones, after that, Isteones, Suevi, and Vandali, then also Thetanes, Theutontes, Vindelici, Vandalisci, after that Alemanni, and last of all, of the Romanes (as some hold) they were generally entearmed Germani. So that by these it is plainly shown, how almost all countries and nations have at diverse times been diversly and diffe∣ringly called: by the occasion of which, many writers that have not indeed seriously and laboriously lookt into frag∣ments of old and authentike fathers, for the derivations and first originals of cities and countries, have beene infe∣cted with some disease or other of ignorance and errour; by reason of which daungerous sickenesse, first creeping (though not perceived) into the heads of men learned and of authoritie, it hath prooved universally mortall, to all those that have not invoked the aid of that good Phy∣sician, Industrie, throughout all the world wheresoever. And so now againe wee will returne to the place from whence we last of all set forth, which was from the matters and particulars which we handled of king Tuscus, sole ru∣ler and commaunder of all the countrey of Italy, of whose
actions or memorable atcheevements, there is little read in any authors, onely it is writ, that hee first invented the order and dignitie of the Palladian knighthood, and in∣stituted large priviledges and allowances for the maintai∣nance of that new found ceremonie. And of any matter else which might challenge unto it selfe worth and extra∣ordinarie commends, done and performed by him, few or no hystorians have written: onely hee left after him, his son Altheus inheritor & rightfull successor to his govern∣ment and kingdome. Altheus then, the son of Tuscus, began to take upon him the rule and commaund of Italie, presently after the death of his deceased father, which was the fourth yeare after the death of his grandfather Hercules in Spaine, who as you have heard, left inheritour unto him Hesperus, the brother of Atlas, for the governement of that countrey: which Hesperus had not there long reigned, but hee was expulsed and driven out of his countrey by violent and oppressive meanes by his brother Atlas the gyant, surna∣med Italus: so that now hee was enforced to forsake the countrey, and to flie into Italie, in one part of which, hee afterward commaunded, and called it after his own name Hesperia, which name it long time afterwards retained. After this, Atlas Italus, not contented sufficiently with the principalitie and dominion of Spaine (as overambi∣tiously thoughted) came also into Italie, and overswayed by his mightinesse and power al the country round about, and created and established himselfe king & ruler therof, and called all the countrey generally after his owne name, Italia, by which it is at this day called, & in the kingdome of Spaine he appointed one of his sonnes to reign called
Sicorus, which was now by just account the foureteenth king thereof. When these things were thus done, he went also into Sicilia, as Galatheus before had done, and there for a while he rested himselfe, till at the length he returned againe backe into Italie, wherin afterwards he lived many yeares. This Italus Atlas by his descent was of the linage of Iaphet, and of his sonne Comerus Gallus, the first king of Italie; and it was hee, which according to the opinions of many, excelled most of all men then living, in the knowledge of Astrologie, for which cause, the busie Poets fained, that he supported and upheld the heavens with his shoulders. Altheus all this while was suppressed and kept under by the mightinesse of this ruler, by reason whereof, hystories cannot speake of any worthie matter done or performed by him: onely it is written, he builded and ere∣cted two very large and beautifull cities, one of them cal∣led Alteta, the other Althea, with a castle also called after the same name. And this Altheus, the sonne of Tuscus before specified, was uncle unto Dardanus, the first builder and founder of Troy. Hee had also a sonne called Blascon, but it is not read, that hee was afterward Coritus, that is, king of Italie, or commanded in any extraordinary power and authoritie; but that this Atlas Italus created and esta∣blished one of his owne sonnes, called Morges, in the dignitie and office thereof, wrongfully disinheriting the true heires that might lawfully have challenged the same: so that by this unjust meanes of usurpation & greatnesse, the line and issue of Hercules was debarred from the pos∣sessing and enjoying of what rightfully belonged unto them. Also he created and appointed his daughter called Rhoma, as dutchesse and commaundresse of the people
and nation called Aborigines (of whome heretofore wee something spoke of.) And this Rhoma was afterward ma∣ried to a prince of Tuscane, of whom she had a son called after her owne name Rhomanessos, who was the first that ever laid the first foundation of the citie of Rome; as Sem∣pronius very confidently affirmeth, condemning all those which attribute the first founding thereof unto Romulus, who (sayth hee) indeed beautified and enlarged the same, but was not the first that laid the foundation thereof; and that his name Romulus (being himselfe found hard by that cittie by wonderous accident) tooke his name of Roma, and not Roma of Romulus, as the above written authour Sempronius, a very sufficient writer, and some others also of allowed authoritie, have averred the same. And the interpretation of this word Rhomanessos, as S. Ierome, the Talmudists, and many others doe expound it, is as much, as, Magna aut potens sublimitas, a mightie or powerfull height or glorie; beeing compounded of two severall words of the Aramean language; Roma, which interpre∣ted, signifies sublimitas, and Nesson, which is validum or magnum: or as some understand it, it signifieth validum augurium, which is, a strong and infallible prophecie, which indeed the exceeding greatnesse & all subjugating power & mightinesse of that Empire did afterwards very fitly answer and make good, being raised unto that infinit greatnesse and highest perfection of soveraignetie, that it impelled almost the greater part of the world to sue unto her for favour, and to become tributarie in great taxes and impositions unto her seat & magnificence. And this citie also was called long after by the name of Valentia: of which, now wee will cease further to entreat, returning to
the matter before handled of Atlas, surnamed Italus, now flourishing and commaunding over Italie in great puissance, glorie, and mightinesse: who although (as it is alreadie before specified) he bore great affection, favour, and love unto his sonne Morges, and had established him in the regaltie and kingdome of Italie, as Coritus, yet hee began in the end to thinke and meditat with himself how apparent and monstrous wrongs and indignities hee had offered to all the issue and posteritie of Hercules, in expel∣ling Altheus, and depriving his sonne Blascon of his right in the principalitie of that countrey; & in those thoughts and humors, hee caused to be called unto him Camboblas∣con, the sonne of the beforementioned Blascon, the sonne of Altheus, and in lieu and recompence of all former and forepassed injuries, hee gave unto him one of his owne daughters in mariage and matrimoniall association, who was called Electra, with whome in dowrie hee gave all those townes and countries lying about the Alpes and the hether mountaines, nearest confining upon Italie: and upon this, presently after died. After whose death, his sonne Morges, possessed belike with holy and religi∣ous cogitations, acknowledging the mightie wrong and disparagement which his father had imposed on his bro∣ther in law Camboblascon, in depriving him of his rightfull succession, willingly and voluntarily despoiled himselfe of his crowne and commaund, and transferred it upon Cam∣boblascon, whom presently hee caused to bee created and established in the dignitie of Coritus, that is, the Iupiter or king of Italie; and so after that, contented himselfe to live privately and obscurely with his brother in law and sister Electra: with whome hee had not many yeares lived
and conversed, but hee died, and paied Nature that debt which no sureties can put off, or be bound for: and so then Camboblascon was with more generall allowances of the people fully invested in his office and place of Coritus, which is as much to say, as Iupiter Coronatus, as I have al∣readie made known, and which I cannot almost too often expound, in that many have made so many and severall doubts and scrupules, What these Iupiters, Saturnes, and Hercules might meane? which names indeed are nothing else but titles of honour, superioritie, and dignitie: and Iu∣piter was such, as in Aegypt Pharoa, and in Rome Caesar, and as now their Pope: for Iupiter is as much as, Iuvans pater: and Papa, Pater patrium. And whereas the supersti∣tious people in those dayes honored and reverenced them as gods, it was nothing else, but for some excellencie and great dignitie they possessed, or for some great vertue, learning, and knowledge they were then endued with, as Fabius Pictor and Zenophon have delivered the same, say∣ing: Principes quia iusti erant, & religionibus dediti, iure habiti dij, & dicti. Non enim arbitria illorum ab equo, vel populis à iure innato discedebant. Now then having satisfied that point, we may the more boldly proceed with our in∣tendment and with the matters of this Camboblascon, king of Italie, and Iupiter and Patriarke thereof, and the great father (as they say) of the famous and renowmed Trojans. And this king built the faire cittie of Montoblascon in Tuscania, which by corruption is now called and knowne by the name of Montflascon: and another also which hee named Coritus, now called Cornete, which is situated about some fortie miles from the now mightie cittie of Rome. And this Camboblascon had by his wise Electra, the
daughter of Atlas Italus king of Italie, three children, which are these, Iasius, Dardanus, and Armonia: Iasius be∣ing created Coritus and Patriarke of Italie, his father being alive, who also bestowed upon him the rule and kingdome of Fraunce (as many hystoriographers affirm) the next yeare after; so that he became very mightie and powerfull in all those countries thereabouts. And now we will proceed with the rest of the kings of Fraunce, begin∣ning where we last left of, which was (if it bee remembred) at Galatheus, the noble sonne of Hercules of Lybia, and of his faire wife Galathea: where it was then mentioned, how this Galatheus at the hands of his loving brother Tuscus, received the Island of Sicilia, and accordingly, caried with him people to inhabite and possesse the countrey, which being performed, he returned also back again into Fraunce, as hath been likewise before somewhat touched: after which time, hee lived peaceably and quietly many yeares, governing his people with great mildnesse and clemencie, and yet mingled and accompanied with up∣rightnesse of justice, and execution of his laws and edicts; of whose deeds and performances, more than are alreadie spoken of, few or no writers have mentioned, onely, that of him and of his name the countrey generally was called Gaule, and so continued, and the people therof tearmed Gaulons, which by corruption and overturning of many ages and times, are now in some part of that countrey called Wallons, and which before Galatheus, were called Samothei or Celti. And it is most likely by the conjectu∣rall opinions of most writers, that this king Galatheus re∣mained and lived in those dayes for the most part in that part of Gaule, which is now the province of Acquitaine,
which is so called of the abundance of waters and rivers, wherein that countrey was wont to exceed, and that this place was held to be the first and most auncient of all the other parts of Fraunce, which indeed are onely two more, for that the whole countrey of France is by most devided onely into three parts, and they are called Gallia Acqui∣natica, Celtica, and Belgica, which of themselves retaine and carie the very names of the first kings and rulers of them, as before is something specified. The cheefe citties and principall siegnories of Gallia Aquinatica,The cheefe cities of Gallia Ac∣quinatica. are suppo∣sed and held to bee these, as most auncient writers doe consent, Narbon, Thoulouse, Caours, Rodetz, Lymoges, Perigort, Bourdeaulx, Zainctes, Augolesme, Baione, Clermont, Bourges, Tours, Foix, Lestore, Allebreth, Saint Pons, Nantes, Resnes, Saint Malo, and others. The cheefest rivers and waters, these, Gironde, Dordonne, Garonne, Loire, Lalier, Cher, Charente, & many others, now too long to recite. After the death of the famous and most renowmed prince Galatheus, his sonne Harbon tooke upon him the governement of the countrey, and was established the twelfth king of Fraunce, who presently erected and built a very gallant cittie for his seat, and called it Harbonne after his owne name, which is now called Narbonne, as many authours doe affirme. And of this king, little or nothing is left written, memorable, or meriting a tedious commemoration or rehearsall: onely hee left behind him a son called Lugdus, which was now the thirteenth king of this countrey of Fraunce, and who built the famous citie called Lugdunum, called also Lyon; which is now one of the cheefest and principallest cities of France, and
which hath long time flourished in great priviledges, pre∣rogatives, and extraordinarie customes, beeing a citie in∣deed tres-auncient and of long continuance; and of her name, all that province is called Lyonnoise, which, as some hold, is contained within the bounds of Gallia Cel∣tica, and is the greatest and the cheefest part thereof.The first foundation & building of the cittie of Lyons in Fraunce. And this citie of Lyons was first founded and erected by the same king Lugdus, in the twelfth yeare of the raigne of Mancaleus, the foureteenth king of Babylon, which is as much to say, as after the floud & inundation of the whole world sixe hundred and fourescore yeares, after the first inhabiting of Fraunce five hundred and sixteene yeares, before the foundation of the cittie of Troy one hundred and fortie yeares, and before the now famous citie of Paris was erected, two hundred and twentie years, before Rome was built, five hundred threescore and eighteene yeares, and before the incarnation and birth of our Saviour Christ a thousand sixe hundred seven and thirtie yeares, or neare thereabouts. And in the times of this king Lugdus, arrived and came into Fraunce the queene Isis, who was so famous and so renowmed throughout all the world. After this Lugdus succeded his eldest sonne Belgius, now the foureteenth king of that countrey, whose name is yet even fresh in all mens memories, for of his name that great and populous countrey called Gallia Belgica, tooke her title and was so called, of which (as of the other) we will now make some mention. The cheefest rivers and waters thereof are these, Lescault, la Sambre, le Lis, le Rin, Meuse, and Moselle, Saine, Marne, Somme, le Daulx, and others: the cheefe woods and forrests these, Mormault,
and Ardenne. The highest hils and mountaines, are the hill Saint Claude, les Faucsilles, and Vosegus. The prin∣cipall villages and greatest citties are these: Cambray, Vallenciennes, Couloign, Conflans, Vtrecht, Mayence, Strasbourg, Aix, Constance, Lyege, Tournay, Arras, Amiens, Beauvais, Senlis, Laon, Noyon, Soissons, Meaulx, Rouan, Rains, Metz, Langres, Besancon, Salins, Dole, Losanne, Geneve, and Camberi. The cheefe sieg∣nories are these: the Dukedomes of Iulliers, Cleves, Cheldes, Brabant, Lorraine, Bar, Lembourg, and Luxem∣bourg: the counties Palatine, Haynau, Bourgoigne, Fer∣retes, Montbeliard, Flaunders, Artois, Champaine, Hol∣land, Zeland, and Namur. This king Belgius (of whome all these gallant and most famous countries were thus called) builded also the citie of Belges, of which, now only some ruines and reliques of memorie are left, which are to be seene in the countrey of Haynau, and which Iulius Cae∣sar likewise in the sixteenth booke of his Commentaries doth mention & remember, where he calleth it Belgium. This word Belgius (as many old writers expound it) signi∣fieth in the Hebrew or Phenician language (which toung the ancient Gauloys then used) as much as, An auncient god wrastling; for in those times (as I alreadie have spo∣ken) the people called their kings, gods: by which it may be gathered, that this their king Belgius was a great wrast∣ler, unto which kind of exercise and unto the barriers, the people inhabiting in Gallia Belgica did not long since wonderfully much addict themselves, & were very active and skilfull therein, howsoever at this day those sports for the most part are now utterly left off and rejected. S. Ierom sayth also, That this word Belga signifieth in the Hebrew
tongue, An auncient commotion, or an old strife: and in∣deed heretofore those people of that country were much conversant in wars, in troubles, and dissentions, and were held to bee the most valiant and strongest nation of this part of the world, as Caesar also in his Commentaries al∣leadgeth to the same purpose, saying: Fortissimi autem omnium Belgi. And Strabo in the fourth booke of his Commentaries also sayth thus: Omnium Gallorum Belgi sunt summi: as a people that in those times (as it is writ∣ten) could bring into the field three hundred thousand fighting men. And thus much for the descriptions of the people of the countrey called Gallia Belgica, with the cheefest townes, siegnories, and rivers thereof, and now we will looke back again for the prosecuting and finishing of our former matter. In this king Belgius, the line and race of Galatheus the sonne of Hercules Lybicus, failed and was determinate, so that upon his death the people of Fraunce (beeing of themselves wonderfully desirous to elect one of that li∣nage so near as it was possible) bestowed the government and commaund of that countrey upon the above written Iasius Ianigena, the sonne of Iupiter Camboblascon. And so by that meanes Iasius was invested and established in that kingdome as the fifteenth king and Patriark thereof. And in this yeare the realm & kingdome of Athens in Greece was first set up and begun, as Berosus our cheefly followed author in these matters of antiquitie averreth, who thus saith: Apud Ianigenas à patre, Iasius creatus est Coritus, & anno sequente simul ceperent duo reges, videlice primus Rex Athentensium Cecrops priscus, & Iasius Ianigena apud Celtas. And this was about fourescore yeares or there∣abouts
before the first building and erection of the cittie of Troy. Iasius Ianigena, the eldest son of Iupiter Camboblascon (as is before declared) beeing thus so gloriously possessed of two such regall and powerfull kingdomes, and being in the cheefest spring and blooming daies of his age, contra∣cted and joined in mariage with a noble and rich ladie called Ipitis Cibeles: for the celebration of which nuptials and espousals, great feasts and ceremonies of joy and tri∣umph were held and kept, and (as some write) performed in the cittie of Viterbe, then the capitall seat of all Tusca∣nia. And this was before the foundation of Troy three∣score and seventeene yeares, in the presence of Dardanus the first builder thereof, and brother to the new maried king Iasius Ianigena. Many writers doe affirme, That in this mariage were greater triumphs, pastimes, sports, magnificencie, state and pomp, than in any other in those times throughout all the world whatsoever, and cheefely in respect of that noble assembly and meeting of so many mightie and great princes, and more particularly for the comming of the famous empresse and goddesse (as they tearme her) the Aegyptian Isis, the daughter of Cham, the wife of Iupiter Iustus, otherwise called Osyris, and the mo∣ther of that all renowmed and ever memorable conque∣rour, Hercules of Lybia, king and emperor of all Fraunce, Italie, and Spaine. And this Isis there first taught those peple the manner of making bread, of floure, meale, and such like stuffe; although before that Osyris her husband had instructed them in knowledge of agriculture, tilling, and sowing corne, yet they were not untill now perfected in the use and right applying thereof, especially for the
making of bread, which they learned and understood by the comming of this empresse Isis. And this mariage and ceremonie of association and matrimonie was the first that in those times was celebrated and solemnized with any rites, feastivals, or new invented usances, as Diodorus Siculus to the same purpose thus sayth, these beeing his very words: Has nuptias à dijs primum celebratas ferunt, Cereremque in gratiam Iasij ei ex frumento panem attulisse, Mercurium lyram, Palladem decantatum monile peplum, ac tibias, &c. This their goddesse Isis, otherwise called by the names of Ceres, Iuno, Frugifera, Legifera, and others, was by all probabilitie and by the opinion of all writers a woman of wonderfull long life and many yeares, for at her now arrivall and comming to this mariage into Italie, she was at the least foure hundred and fiftie yeares old, as shee that was borne in the first yeare of the raigne of Se∣miramis queene of Babylon, and lived in the whole at the least six hundred and sixteene yeares, for shee was living after the first destruction and desolation of Troy, by the space of fortie yeares or neare thereabouts, as almost all writers have delivered in their opinions to the same pur∣pose and effect. Iohannes Annius an old writer, sayth, That shee was in Germanie in the time of Hercules Ale∣mannus, the eleventh king of that countrey, by him called Almaigne: and Cornelius Tacitus also seemeth to affirme the same by these words, Pars Suevorum etiam Isidi sacrifi∣cat. It is written also, that she was in Fraunce in the time of Lugdus then king thereof, as hath beene before decla∣red, and that shee had travelled almost all these parts of Europe, instructing and teaching the poore ignorant people the use of many things then unknown & unfound
out. And to approove the better that she was present at this mariage of Iasius Ianigena, it is yet apparent in that countrey of Tuscan by many very auncient scrols, lest still from time to time in that countrey from one posteritie to another; as also certaine old statues and monuments of marble, with inscriptions of characters infixed thereon, found out in the times of Pope Alexander the sixt, averre the same, which as Iohannes Annius sayth, were first found in the earth in the citie of Viterbe: and that there were at that time upon further digging and search of more such like reliques, found hidden far in the ground four severall images or pictures of triumph, the one was of Iasius, the other of his mother Electra, the third of his faire sister Armonia, which never maried, but continued and died a vestall virgine, and the fourth was of Cibeles the now new maried wife of Iasius. There was also found another square kind of table made of marble, on which were in Greeke letters, these words following engraved, which not long after were thus translated into Latine. Coritina desponsa∣tio, cum Electra Atlai Kytij iamdudum pertransiverat, & maxima Isis Frumentaria atque Panifica, concessit ad nup∣tias Iasij filij Coriti, in habitaculum turrite Cibeles sponse Iasij in prelio Cybelario, ad fontem Cybelarium, paulo post sub vadimonia palatia, & paulo post à scelerato fratre Dardano Iasius male perijt in agro Iasinello in Theisijs, &c. And these be the very words used heretofore by authors of antiqui∣tie. By these therefore and by like semblable apparences it is cleared, that this Isis, their so reverently-adored god∣desse, was now present at the consummation of the espou∣sals of Iasius Ianigena, king of Italie and Fraunce, with the ladie Ipitis Cibeles, his wife. And that this Isis had travelled
and journeied through many and diverse countries, it ap∣peareth by many and severall pillars and stonie monu∣ments erected in many countries of Europe in that be∣halfe, as many authours doe produce. Diodorus Siculus inferreth, That in Aegypt shee caused her selfe a mightie and stately columne to be erected, wherein she caused also these words to bee insculped and inserted. Ego sum Isis Egipti Regina, à Mercurio erudita. Que ego legibus statui, nullus soluet: ego sum Osyrides, ego sum prima frugum in∣ventrix, ego sum Oriregis mater. But to omit many other like authorities and approvements which might conduce to the clearer manifesting and unclouding of what was first proposed, wee will now goe forward with this royall mariage of Iasius, that we with more speed may attaine to the complete accomplishment and effectuating of my purposed entendment. This great king and ruler Iasius Ianigena had of this his wife Cibeles a sonne called Corybantus, so that now there wanted not any terrene or earth-born delight or felicitie which might make this happie-seeming potentate more fortunat, mightie, or contentfull, but it is a common hu∣mor of fortune, that amidst the thickest and most abun∣dances of her graces and favours, shee in some angrie or fantasticke imagination, suddainely snatcheth away her so liberally bestowed gifts, and leaveth the late possessors thereof involved and wrapt in a world of the miserablest unhappinesse and soule vexations that may be invented, as by the fatall successe and end of this kings life most plainely appeareth. For when as Dardanus, his younger brother (a man indeed of a proud heart, great courage, and inward ambition) saw his brother Iasius thus to float
(as it were) on the calme seas of joyous prosperitie, and to tast of the sweet cup of Nectar, which Fortune often∣times administreth unto her favourites, and thus to live famous in such abundant measure of grace and happi∣nesse; hee infinitely repined and malliciously stomacked such the greatnesse and height of his power and authori∣tie, he beeing himselfe so suppressed and obscured by the spight of Fortune, and living privately and without com∣maund, as an inferiour or some base born person or slave. These things oftentimes revolving and studying within himselfe, he could not now any longer depresse or quench the overfurious heat of his aspiring spirit, but in a dis∣dainefull and scorning kind of fashion went unto his bro∣ther the king, to demaund leave and licence, That (upon some occasions of discontent pretended) he might depart out of the countrey to seeke out his better fortunes: which request Iasius refused to condiscend unto, and would by no meanes allow of his brothers purposes in that behalfe intended: whereupon Dardanus (taking it in great dislike and disparagement unto his greatnesse) began secretly to enter into deadly hostilitie with him, and to gather ma∣ny factions and parties together on his side, which, by reason that he was exceedingly well beloved throughout most of those countries, grew to a great number and mul∣titude of men, especially of those people then inhabiting on the other side of the river Tybre, which we called since the Latines, besides the countrey of Naples, Povilla, Ca∣labria, and others thereabouts; all these conjoyned and consorted with the faction of Dardanus: and with Iasius, all those on this side of Tybre, beeing them of Tuscania, Fraunce, and other particular provinces thereabouts. At
this very time (as many writers doe deliver) happened in the world many uncouth, straunge, and wonderfull por∣tents, as fearefull earthquakes, lightening, blazing comets, and ougly visions; as also throughout all Thessalie a ge∣nerall overflow and deluge of waters, in another part of Greece, a strange combustion of houses and townes, and miserable effects of fire throughout most part of that countrey. In the same time also, Pharao king of Aegypt following Moyses and the children of Israel through the red sea, with all his armie perished and were overwhelmed with the churlish buffetings of the angrie and wrathfull billowes. All which signes and extraordinarie accidents did manifestly pretoken & prefigure the suddain approch of some great alteration of estates, and troubles of migh∣tie kingdomes. The fire of discontent and enmitie betweene the two brothers beeing thus wholly set on flame, and diverse at∣tempts and meetings of wrath passed betweene them, it happened that Dardanus received the worst, and upon many encounters still was put unto his shifts, especially by the fresh supplie and aid which Siceleus, king of the isle of Sicilia, & the sixteenth king of Spain had then brought unto his brother Iasius: so that continually being weake∣ned more and more both in numbers of men, and in the courages of them that staied, he was enforced for his own securitie to give over those such publicke meanes of op∣pression and revenge, and to betake his thoughts unto contriving and plotting of some more inward and there∣fore more daungerous stratagems. So that in the end (to avoid prolixitie and tedious circumstance) he so wrought that he awaited a time when the king his brother (then all
suspectlesse of any intended mischeefe) went privately to a fountaine or spring to wash himselfe, which occasion and oportunitie so fairely presenting it selfe, Dardanus most traiterously and vilely murdered him. And upon that, not daring to adventure his stay, or to engage him∣selfe so far in those cases of perill, he presently tooke ship∣ping in the next haven, and with all his jewels & what else riches portable, he could cary with him away, with many of his freinds, followers, and servitors, he secretly and closely set saile and departed. The right noble and trespuissant king of Fraunce thus cruelly murdered by the bloudie hands of his owne natu∣rall (though in that unnaturall) brother, in the fiftith year of his raigne and mightie governement, and in the four∣score and fourth yeare of his owne age; all the people and inhabitants thereabouts began mightily to bewaile his untimely and miserable end, which was before the foun∣dation of Troy eight and twentie yeares or much therea∣bouts. In generall deploration and laments of this kings death, not only Italy and France, but all parts of the world unto whome the shrill voiced trumpet of Fame had sounded forth this report, conjoyned and bemoned to∣gether, for that hee kept peace and amitie with all princes whatsoever, in all unitie, love, and concord; and carried himselfe so upright and so wise in the troublesome mana∣ging of affaires belonging unto two kingdomes, that hee gained and woon unto him the hearts and affections of almost all people whatsoever. After his death, his sonne Coribantus succeeded in the governement of the king∣dome of Italie, but not of Fraunce, so that the people thereof were a good while after without a cheefe or ruler:
but in the end they chose and elected one that was nea∣rest unto the linage and line of Hercules as they might, and his name was Allobrox, now the sixteenth king ther∣of. The which king afterward for the most part kept and remained at the foot of the mountaines Apennini, afron∣ting upon Italie, and there commaunded even unto the hils Pyrenei (which divide the countrey of Spaine from France) and from the Mediterranean sea unto the maine Ocean, and unto the river of Rhyne: and he there builded and erected many famous townes and citties, of which, some were those which were since called Piemont, Savoy, Proavnce, Daulphine, and others, and which people of very late times (if not at this day) were called Allobroges: and in this kings raigne was the farre-famed and mightie citie of Troy first built and erected. To come unto the foundation of which, wee must here in these affaires pause and take breath a while, and returne unto Dardanus, now on the sea tossed with uncertaine fortunes, and tempest-beaten indeed with overblowing and cruell winds, so that he remained in very great daunger and hazard to bee cast away and swallowed in the vast and mercilesse embrace∣ments of the all-wracking waters. Enforced by these ca∣lamities, hee was glad to put in at an Island of the Ci∣clades, attending there the favourable smiles of For∣tune, and the abatement of those horrible and tempestu∣ous stormes. In the end hee put foorth againe, and recove∣red the sea Archipelagus, and went afterwards on shore in an Island in Greece called Samos or Samothrace, ac∣cording to that which the Poet Virgil in his eight booke of his Aeneidos sayth: Arunculos, ita ferre senec his ortus
in agris, Dardanus Ideas frigiae penetravit ad urbes, Treici∣amque Samum quae nunc Samothracia fertur. This Island of Samos or Samothracia, is directly opposite unto the countrey of Thrace in Greece where Constantinople is erected, which heretofore abounded in all plenteous ma∣ner with Vines, Olive trees, Grapes, and others such like fruit of most sorts; and in this countrey also was the lear∣ned and famous Philosopher Pythagoras borne, and one of the prophetesses called Sibeles Sameos: but it is now (the more to bee lamented) in the tyrannous hands and possessions of the bloudie and barbarous Turke. In this countrey, Dardanus staied a good space before he laid the foundation of Troy, hoping yet to bee recalled home a∣gaine into Italie: but when hee perceived that all hopes were frustrate that were builded on such grounds, hee put∣teth himselfe foorth to seeke out as yet his further for∣tunes, which happened as hereafter shall breefely be un∣folded. It is to be understood, that on the other side of the sea Helle sponte, which is called also the streights leading un∣to Constantinople, in the firme continent of a countrey called Asia Minor, now called Natalia or Turkie, and not far from the above written Island of Samos, is a province called Lydia, which heretofore was called also Meonia; in the which countrey, as also in those next and neare adjoy∣ning thereunto called Phrygia, raigned and governed at that time a prince called by the name of Athus the youn∣ger, of the same bloud and parentage as was Dardanus for (if it bee remembered) we long since spake how Her∣cules of Lybia had a ladie to his wife called Omphale, by
whom hee begat a sonne called Athus the great, of which Athus, from discent to discent in foure generations came this Athus the younger king of Meonia and Phrygia, and who had two sonnes also, the one called by the name of Lydus, the other Turhenus. This king Athus having now upon the arrivall of Dardanus, great abundance of peo∣ple in his countrey, by reason of fruitfull encreases and multiplications: and having also but small store of victu∣als and food in his countrey to nourish and maintaine so populous a state, for want of which, great famines, pesti∣lences, and other diseases arose in the countrey, knew not almost how to dispose of his people, or in what sort to re∣medie this mischeefe, so that in the end hee was enforced by reason of that mortall famine, to discharge many of his subjects out of the countrey to seeke out some new inhabitations and places of abode: which thing also they wonderous willingly embraced as glad to be rid and quit of so penurious and starving a place. Dardanus hearing and understanding of these proceedings, and in what ne∣cessities they stood in by meanes of the overaboundance of inhabitants, presently made his repaire to king Athus, and there desired of him, That since hee must needs send forth such people for the finding out of new places of ha∣bitations, that he would bestow the charge, conduct, and leading of them upon him, and that hee would joyne with them for the provisions and necessaries needfull and con∣venient for the setling of themselves in such their new places of abode, residence, and habitation. This thing king Athus very willingly entertained, especially, for that Dardanus was of his owne kindred and consanguinitie.
This request and desire of Dardanus thus obtained, hee knew no other meanes to requite so great a favour, and to bee occasion to draw on further kindnesses, but to offer unto Athus, and utterly to resigne all his right, title, in∣terrest, and claime in the kingdome of Italie for one of his sonnes, unto which of them the father pleased and was contented. This profer of Dardanus beeing well conside∣red of by king Athus, was in the end thankefully accepted: in lieu and exchaunge whereof was allowed unto Darda∣nus a certaine quantitie and peece of ground in Phrygia for him to build and erect a citie upon. And betweene the two brethren, Lydus and Turrhenus, lots were indifferent∣ly cast, which of them with a certaine number of people should set forward for Italie, and which should stay at home: for the deciding whereof, it fell unto Lydus to re∣main behind, and to be left inheritor unto that kingdome which afterwards of his name was called Lydia; and that Turrhenus should bee presently dispatched away with his people to inhabite in Italie, of whome afterwards also it was called by the name of Turrhena. These covenants and agreements concluded upon, Turrhenus setteth for∣ward from Asia Minor (now called Turkie) in his journey for Italie; and Dardanus with his people and associats be∣gan now to build in Phrygia, and in short space fully finished and erected a citie, which he called after his own name Dardania: which was before the incarnation of Christ a thousand foure hundred fourescore and seven yeares, before the building of Rome by Romulus foure hundred and seven and twentie yeares, and before the citie of Paris was erected threescore and tenne yeares, as
Eusebius and most writers doe affirme. On the other side Turrhenus is arrived in Italie, and presently repaireth un∣to the queene Cibeles, the widdow and late wife to Iasius Ianigena, as before hath been declared, as also unto her sonne Coribantus king of Tuscania; unto which two, hee brought and presented many costly and rich gifts from his father Athus king of Meonia: who also received them in all gracious and kind acceptance, as comming from their kinsman, and of the race and bloud of Hercules of Lybia. Turrhenus had not long remained here, but that he was highly favoured of the king Coribantus, who now desirous to see and understand of the estate of his kins∣man Dardanus, prepared presently to take in hand that so long and tedious journey, and ordained and instituted at home for the governement of his countrey, the order of the twelve Dukes, whereof Turrhenus was one; and so with a great troupe and companie of followers & friends he embarked for the cost of Phrygia, to see the greatnesse of Dardanus, and the beautie and excellencie of his new built citie Dardania. After some tedious and troublesome travels in this voyage, at the last hee arrived at his wished and desired place, where with all manner of ceremonie he was joyfully entertained by Dardanus, whose recipro∣call and mutuall love grew in the end to bee such, as hee resolved and there set downe his rest for ever to remaine, and not to returne againe into Italie, but sent word the∣ther of his purposes, and commaunding them to create and establish Turrhenus in his absence king and sole ru∣ler over all that countrey. In few yeares Dardanus began to grow unto great mightinesse, riches, and power, who
had also a neighbour prince, of mightie puissance, weal∣thie, and fortunate, whose name was Terus, whereupon many writers call the Phrygians also Teucri; and this Teucrus was the sonne of Scamander and Idea, and had also himselfe a very beautifull and faire daughter, which hee maried shortly after unto Dardanus, and was called Batea, of whome Dardanus begot a sonne called Eictho∣nius, who succeeded after him and was inheritour unto the kingdome of Phrygia. This Ericthonius in processe of time arose up unto a wonderfull greatnesse and large possessions, who (as many writers do affirme) was accoun∣ted to bee one of the richest kings in those daies in that part of the world, who (as it is also said) had at the least three thousand horses of his owne continually feeding in his pastures. And this Ericthonius had also a sonne whom he named Tros, whome after his death hee left as successour and inheritour unto him, and of whose name afterwards the Dardanians were called Trojans. This Tros very much obliged and beautified the cittie also of Dar∣dania, ; which long time after it retai∣ned  had three sonnes, which were, Ilus, Assaracus,  hee brought up in the know∣ledge  warlicke sciences, unto which kind of studie (as it is written) hee himselfe also was much addi∣cted, and had many yeares together maintained hostile warres with the king of Crete called Iupiter, the fourth of that name there: in which warres, his sonne Ganimedes was taken prisoner even by the hands of Iupiter himselfe, who for that in his ensigne and colours he gave an Eagle, (being his armes) it should seeme the Poets for that cause
have devised and feigne  as hee was on hunting was snatcht up from the  unto heaven by Iupiter,  Eagle, find that hee is now taken for one of the twelve signes of the Zodiake called Aquarius. Some other authors also write, that one Tantalus, king of high Phrygia and of Paphlagonia, a most miserable, covetous and auaricious prince, had laid certaine snaes and privie meanes to entrap this Ganime∣des and to take him prisoner as hee used to sport himselfe in hunting, thinking by that devise to get a mightie raun∣some of his father Tros for the redeeming and enfranchi∣sing of his imprisoned and captivated sonne, and that this Tantalus sent him to one Iupiter of the Isle of Crete, for to safegard him, and to have halfe the raunsome which should bee paied for his redeliverie and freedome. And for such like causes belike, the Poets also doe invent and say, that Tantalus is plagued and tormented in hell, stan∣ding up to the chin in water, and apples hanging downe unto his lips, and yet can neither drinke nor tast the one or the other; and it is also more credibly written, that he died most miserably and in great extremitie. His sonne Pelops also, banished and exiled his owne naturall coun∣trey, fled into Greece, and there maried a wonderfull rich wife and great ladie, by which meanes hee got unto him∣selfe and obtained the commaund of a whole countrey, which he called after his own name Peloponnesus, which is now the countrey of Mauritania, and subject unto the Empire of the Turke. And of this Pelops issued and came the two famous captaines, Agamemnon and Menelaus. Tros thus having lost his sonne on this fashion, studied
upon revenge, and in the meane times comforted him∣selfe with his two other sonnes, Ilus and Assaracus. And this Ilus called Troy after that, Ilion; who begat a sonne named Laomedon, the father of the renowmed Priamus: and of Assaracus issued and came Anchises, Aeneas father. And the before written Tros ruled & commaunded there in great power and puissance for the space of threescore yeares or neare thereabouts,Archilochus. as Archilochus in his booke of Times alloadgeth. Laomedon, the sonne of king Ilus (as is beforesaid) after the death of his father tooke upon him the rule and go∣vernment of Troy, in the two hundred and two and twen∣tieth yeare after the first foundation therof by Dardanus, and hee had five sonnes and two daughters, which were these, Priamus, Titonus, Lampus, Clytion, and Letaon, and of these Homer in his Iliads maketh further mention: his daughters were Antigone and Hesione.Homer. The Greeke Poets (who indeed for the most part are full of such like fables) doe say, that the two gods Neptune and Apollo, for a cer∣taine summe of money promised them by him, went with him about the circuit of the citie, and there erected won∣derfull strong and most huge high wals round about the same: the which wals afterwards finished accordingly, and no money received nor to bee got, Apollo in great rage and anger infected the citie with a deadly and generall pe∣stilence; and Neptune in token of his wrath and displeasure also, sent a monster of the sea among them, unto which, they must every day give and throw a young child, or els that they all should perish and bee devoured by the rave∣nous maw and hunger thereof; and that in the end it hap∣pened
upon the daughter of Laomedon (called Hesione) to be given unto this marine beast, which (say they) was rescued and releeved by great fortune by Hercules of Greece, which came that way, and who afterwards slew that monster, and in gratification therof the ladie Hesione (the daughter of Laomedon) was promised unto him not long after in marriage, but yet not married unto him by reason of the unwillingnesse afterward (howsoever it fell out) of her father: for the breach of which promise, Her∣cules afterwards slew Laomedon in open battell, and spoy∣led and ruinated such his glorious citie. And for that The∣lamon his consort had that day behaved himselfe very valiantly in fight, hee bestowed the young ladie Hesione upon him, as his concubine and slave; who carried her away with him into the countrey of Solamina, whereof he was then king and ruler. But it is most certaine, that for the most part all those Greeke writers have erred infi∣nitely and have delivered many most unlikely hystories: for this Hercules (as hath been before spoken) was a nota∣ble and a famous pyrate; and hee slew Laomedon by trecherie, and surprised Troy on a suddaine and unawares, and also hee was a common ravisher of maidens, as of Hesione, Medea, and others, as Manethon, Iohannes Annius, and Iacques de Bergame have written and very plainely approved the same. Laomedon beeing slaine, Titonus suc∣ceeded next after him: but he being of another dispositi∣on, resigned his interrest therein, and betooke himselfe to travell into straunge countries, even unto the Indies, where (according to Diodorus Siculus) hee maried a ladie called Ida, and (as the Poets write) Aurora: of whome, hee
afterwards had a sonne called Memnon, who long after came unto the succour of Priamus in his cheefest warres, and was there slaine by the hands of Achilles. In the ab∣sence therfore of his brother Tython, Priamus took upon him the government and charge of that kingdome, being the second son unto Laomedon their father: who in short time came to bee one of the greatest and most famous princes of the world, for it is written, that he was wondrous wise, discreet, and valiant, and matcht his children with persons of great sort, worth, and dignitie. And for to make him at the first the stronger, and that he might have time to reedifie his late spoyled and fire perished cittie, hee en∣tered into alliance and fast kindred with a very mightie and powerfull prince, neare adjoyning upon his country, who was called by the name of Cypseus, or (as some hold) Dymas, king and sole commaunder of Thrace, which is a province in Greece on this side of the sea Hellespont, whereof the cheefe cittie is at this day Constantinople: and with this Cypseus or Dymas his daughter, called He∣cuba, hee maried: a ladie accomplisht with all exteriour graces and inward vertuous dispositions, at which espou∣sals of Priamus and Hecuba, great ceremonies and signes of joyfulnesse were showne foorth and observed: and of this ladie it is writ, that he begot nineteen children male and female: and of other women and concubines which he dayly kept and maintained in his pallace (according to the fashions and usances in those daies) hee had one and thitie more, so that onely nineteene of his fiftie sonnes and daughters were legitimate and lawfully begotten, the rest bastards and illegitimate. That Priamus in all had so
many children (which indeed hee publickely maintained and shamed not to acknowledge) Virgil also in the second booke of his Aeneidos thus sayth: Quinquaginta illi thalami, spes tanta nepotum. And Homer likewise in the last booke of his Iliads most plainely seemeth to confirm the same. Troy now thus most gallantly flourishing, newly forti∣fied, repaired enlarged, enriched, enpeopled, & throughly provided and stored of all manner of things which might bee necessarie either for the use of fatall warres and open hostillities, or for the conservation of peace & domesticke tranquillitie, began to assume unto her selfe a mighty and glorious selfe-conceit and strong opinion of her owne power, height, and magnificence, assuring her selfe of all victorious prevailements over her enemies whatsoever, and of a never failing prosperitie, glorie, and felicitie: and yet it is not writ, that Priamus himselfe was puft up with any more extraordinarie pride or insolencie than became the greatnesse of so puissant a prince. It is writ also, that in the times of this his greatest power, he was forewarned by certaine Oracles and false gods which they used to worship in those daies, that so long as hee did preserve and safegard three things belonging unto the cittie, the towne should bee inexpugnable and never to bee lost, as Servius and Boccace have written of the same; the things were these, The image of Pallas called Paladium, preserved undefaced, The sepulchre or tombe of Laomedon which was under the great gate Scea, kept undespoiled & whole, and so long as the life of Troylus lasted and did endure. Priamus therefore very carefull to keep these three things
with all diligentnesse and heed, lived in the greatest pompe, delicacie, and state that ever any prince in the world in those times did or could: so that he seemed not onely to bee king of Phrygia, but also cheefe dominator and emperour of all Asia, now called Natalia or Turkie: and hee was called also in those times, The king of kings, as Strabo in the thirteenth booke of his Geographie, to the same purpose thus sayth: Priamus magno ex parvo, & Rex Regum effectus. And these his powers and autho∣rities not onely extended and stretcht themselves abroad throughout the maine continent and firme lands of all those countries thereabout round, but in the end shewed themselves also and possessed their maister of many fa∣mous and great Islands lying farre in within the bosome and embracement of the uncivile and rude behaviored sea; as the Island of Tenedos, and the Island of Metelyn, were subject and vassalized unto the governement of his imperious principallitie, paying him yearely tributes, taxes, and impositions; and many others also of great same adjoyning neare thereabout: so that the infinite greatnesse and large commaund of this thrice mightie emperour Priamus, possessed all the princes and rulers of countries neare that way, with astonied admiration and wonderous maze of his so suddaine and unexpected puissancie. And thereupon sent and dispatched messen∣gers from all quarters to crave his amitie, friendship, and to be in league with him, as also to bee nearer allied unto him in some matches and marriages of their children on both sides; by reason whereof, Priamus matched his children with great houses, and of great power and
possessions. First hee married one of his legitimate and lawfully begotten daughters called Creusa, unto a prince of great meanes named Aeneas, the sonne of old An∣chises: his daughter Astyoche, hee matched with one Telephus, a mightie king of Mysia: and his sonne He∣ctor joyned in matrimonie with Andromacha, the faire daughter of Ection, the powerfull and famous king of Thebes and Silicia: and Polydamas, one of the sonnes of Anthenor, married with one of Priamus daughters, (beeing a bastard, and begotten of one of his concu∣bines) beeing of an excellent and singular beautie, called Lycasta. So also manie others of his children were linked and joyned in marriages with men of great rule, power, and commaund in those dayes; the po∣steritie of which, and of their deedes and mightinesse, hereafter in some other place and oportunitie, occasion may bee presented further to speake of, And for this time (beeing indeed forced by an extraordinarie occa∣sion) I must thus on the suddaine abruptly breake of; desiring and wishing very earnestly, that if this small peece of paines of mine shall fortune ever to bee pub∣lickely impressed (which leaving behind mee, it will not bee in my power to prevent) it may indifferently passe uncensured, till the returne of his fortune beaten father may aunswere for the innocencie of the child, and bee able a little better to protect him in his affli∣ctions. And thus it hath beene with great care and diligence laboured to find out the truest Hystorians for the deri∣ving
of Dardanus, and consequently this king Priamus, from the race and line of the first prince and Patriarke Noe, with the particular successions of kings and em∣perours of Europe, as hath beene warranted by the authorities and writings of very learned and authenticke authours.
