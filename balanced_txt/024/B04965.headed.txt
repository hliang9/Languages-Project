As allso a full and true Account how she  Sta  Threescore Milk-women in Mourning for her. COme you Lasses and Maids, VVho pursue Milking Trades, With your Pail: on your Heads strait appearâ–ª Whilst I mourn the sad fall, Of the Cheif of you All, And the best too as much as She's Dead, let each pour Or her Corps a Milk shower, To preserve and to moisten That a Person so just May'nt too soon  to Dust, Or too  Vermin a Prey Ah! how when all She grac'd those who survive, Who admir'd at the Qualities in How She look'd like a When She Danc'd upon VVith her Green But her Maidens may boas Of her Charity most, And her goodness in g  Liquor; For Lord how She'd Swill, And give each of 'm her To make 'em mo sp Both Distiller and Host, May lament that, she's For she was their  certain And a Bn Companion, As chearful as any one Whilst the Quartern and Bottle did had other good vertus hich she show'd to all parties, ot dashing her nw Mlk with water, And she took as great pleasure In f and full Measure.
