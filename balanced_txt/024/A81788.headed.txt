AS ALSO Petitional Motions unto the supreme Authority of this Na∣tion, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, Scot∣land, and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging, that they would be pleased to make use of the Pro∣poser, in entertaining his abilities with Acts of Parliament, ac∣cording to the Lawes of this and all Civil Nations; that then there∣by he may be impowred lawfully and honourably to put in exercise his undertakings: The profitable Effects and Conveniences of them being hereafter sufficiently proved and cleared. All which Designes are undertaken to be performed by new wayes and means, more speedy, cheap and easie than hath hitherto been discovered, and are ac∣quired by the Industry and diligent search into the Mysteries of Nature, Of THOMAS DUCKET, Esq Very well deserving the perusal of persons of all degrees, that love ingenuity, and the more flourishing prosperity of the Commonwealth. LONDON, Printed by Thomas Leach, May the last, 1659.
The Preface. May it please your Honours, THe alterations in State affairs, and other occurrences, being so many as are hereafter published, do therefore require this Preface or Introduction, whereby to give satisfaction unto your Honours and all good people that have so long expected the fruition of what is here tendred. The Contents of all after repetitions giving sufficient proof and reason to convince all Objections and crosse Arguments; As also a Breviate of his Bills as they were prepared by Councel Learned in the Law, and afterwards approved of by Commit∣tees of a former Parliament, deputed for that purpose, who made their report of the said Bills, as also of the Proposers ability to perform the Contents therein conteined, when they should be passed into Acts of Parliament. And although the intent of all that is hereafter declared may seem tedious in the perusal, yet questionlesse your Honours and all worthy Perusers will think the time well spent, for that many Ages never had the like Tender, nor have delayed such hopefull Successes; and therefore might have required a larger Scope to demonstrate the great benefits this Nation might long before this time have received, if that such causes as are after recited, had not obstructed the Settlement. And that your Honours may receive an Account from the Proposer why he doth ex∣postulate, and drive so close and home against persons that he doth conceive to have been, and likely to be, Antagonists to such rich and transcendent hopes; although no such person hath as yet published himself in print to be an Enemy to these new princi∣ples so held forth; for answer thereto I am to let your Honours understand. First, albeit none but of unreasonable impudence, and depraved nature, dare let the world judge of their Folly, by subscribing their Names to such a dangerous discompo∣sure of a national benefit, notwithstanding their high pitch in Envy; yet they dare vent their spightfull invectives against the Proposer in malicious and contemptible frothy discourses behind his back; so that since his first Addresses, which were many years agoe, the Proposer hath been subject to the pressure of Multiplicity of provocations in several companies by spightfull and perverse Detractors, in headlesse and absurd Ar∣guments, especially by those who have thought themselves pregnant and Powerfull; and there can hardly be a greater plague upon Earth, than to be liable to Evill Tongues, and Censures, as the Proposer hath alwayes been, which cannot be redressed, for that the Company of those self-conceited Criticks, who will rail against any mans principles but their own, are numerous, and it is better to have one, two, or three, of such Malevolent spirits to answer unto, if they durst publish their Malignancy in writing, than a thousand others, whom reason will not satisfie, but will at all times, and in all companies, belch forth their spight and Envy against any thing which ex∣ceeds their common capacities; but this many times turns to their own disgrace and shame, when the Proposer discerneth just cause to joyn in contest with them, some part of their presumption arising from the Proposers long delay in gaining an authori∣ty,
to put in Execution what he hath so long held forth, and divers other uncought Arguments, as barren of reason as that aforesaid. But the Proposers cause beng just, doth give him the advantage to master them by Reason, and confute them by Arguments, so much as is sufficient to dash out of Coun∣tenance any unbelieving Criticks, Busie-bodies, Quibling Sophisters, Pickthanks, trifling Ieerers, Buffoons, or froward Humorists, composed of indigested Ignorance; and the virtue of those Truths, which the Proposer holds forth, doth so much out bear their brain-sick Arguments, that it doth increase the Malevolency of their Spleens, to malign all his proceedings with Gall and bitternesse, which is the cause this relati∣on is so fully proved, to give such Evidence, as may convince them in behalf of the Commonwealth. And therefore it is high time for the Proposer to apply himself to your Honours for a speedy Settlement of the Premisses, to the end that he may perform such service to the Nation, as may quite extinguish all contradiction by cavelling Detractors, espe∣cially those who are impudently resolved neither to see or hear, although their own Conscience convince them, and bring them to the unwor hy Odium in the old Proverb, being there is none so blind, as those that will not see, and none so deaf, as those that will not hear. And for this cause, by way of Addresse, the Proposer could present no lesse than what doth hereafter follow: for of necessity there must be the full substance and property of his designs, with their proofs of performance, and answers unto all self-ended Objecti∣ons, and cavelling Expressions, touching the commodity or discommodities of Improve∣ments, together with the Propsers justification of his person and reputation, and proofs and attestations of his knowledge and abilities, as also of the high Degree and Magnitude of what he hath attained unto in Natures Storehouse, with many liberal applauses of the virtue of his new Enterprises, and with more reiterations, than is u∣sual in repugning, and publikely defying persons that formerly have, and still may, breath noisome Air against laudable Actions, that are above their Meridian, and are thereby prodigious to their own good, and the Nations pleasure and plenty. And also treating of the glory that your Honours may attain unto, by entertaining these Tenders, which conduce to a national Improvement, and therefore with good cause, humbly craving your Honours serious viw and revew of the Proposers real integrity in these works tendred, wherein your Honours will discern just cause for all these ensuing expressions, and will thereby the better be induced to hold excused, all the rehersals and recitals in this dictate, that could not be explained without reite∣ration and repetition, to introduce some addition of new matter, fit for observation, though much of affinity with what hath been aforesaid. And although the full observation of the contents, and the many large promises theren conteined, may unto the vulgar capacities seem ostentatious; Yet your Honours prudence will on the contrary weigh them as they are, touching an vniversal benefit, and that these new discoveries may be a preferment to the Nation in general, or to Nations generally, and your Honours will perceive just cause to confesse, that the Theori∣cal, Methoditical, and Practical proceedings in renowned enterprizes, ought to be supported with a more Magisterial fullnesse in words, than can belong to the hope of gaining some small profit, of little value, and short continuance: And therefore by your Honours cannot be esteemed vain boasting: But if there should escape my pen some faulty branches, yet I hope it may in wisdome by your Honours receive a pardon, according to the Proverb, of giving a loser leave to speak, that hath spent and disbursed the best of his years and the best of his estate in this faithful service, and hath had no encou∣ragement,
or returns suitable to his merits, the which would nettle the pen of any b those Naturallists, who do study & observe the conditions f men, with as much circum∣spection as they do the natures of Creatures, Minerals, and Vegetatives, by which inspect∣ion, they have acquired so much discretion as to sleight and invalue those constitutions, whose natures want true season, or some degrees of concoction, to operate in fullnesse of vertue and knowledge, the which the Proposer doth represent to your Honours, as a just reason of the great pains and much patience the Proposer is driven unto, in seeking meanes by all lenity to convince erronious opinions, by offering all manner of curtesie and civil argument, to their curst contradictions, thereby to calm them with Reasons, and satisfactory Arguments: for the Proposer hath no other way to qualify their Malice, unlesse it were in giving some of the chiefest in pride and presumption, some special share and partnership, in the honour and profit which ought to accrue unto the Prpo∣ser and his posterity, by virtue of those Trophees, that Nature and Industry hath indowed him withall. And therefore for quietnesse sake, and a more easie proceeding, that the way may be cleared of all such interruptions to a national good, The Proposer could have willing∣ly thereunto condescended, but that the Heraulds at Arms, and other honorable Anti∣quaries, would have thereby just cause to take Recognizance of the Proposers Trans∣gressions, as to the disgrace of his Name, Descent, and Pedigree, whereof he is so sensi∣ble and tender, that whensoever he doth make room for such a blot against his Friends, and falsity against himself, then let those Officers aforesaid, joyn in defacing his anti∣ent Coat of Arms, by creating the Embleme of some corrupt vermine or beast of prey, to be placed upon the Authors antient Coat of Arms,The Crest be∣longing to the Arms of Ducket, is an Ostrige feather gules invi∣roned in a Crownet of Gold. instead of the present Crest, as an allusion that he so unworthily submitted to pragmattick greedy persons fraighted with Avarice, but empty of Goodnesse, and that Falsehood had overcome Truth, contrary to the known Maxim. And thus the Proposer in his faithfull indulgence to your Honours, and the weal pub∣lique, could not possibly say any thing lesse, than what is herein, and in the ensuing Relation to be expressed, the length and prolixity whereof, he hopes will be the rather dispenced withall, because that things of so large and general a concernment, could not without prejudice and Injury to the matter be wound up and concluded in so con∣cise a brevity as proceedings of small consequence; yet all the contents require not above the twelfth part of a Natural day to be perused, scanned, and conside∣red of; But because many persons cannot admit of so much time to peruse the whole, the Proposer thought it necessary to give some good part of satisfaction in every page, or leaf; the contents whereof, with all humble submission, the Proposer re∣ferrs to your Honours great wisdomes, as also what may seem improper or imperfect in this dictate, or the Printers mistakes, the Proposer doth likewise submit, having alrea∣dy too much intrenched upon your Honours patience, who are further to be used in the premisses and; therefore, what ever else ought to have been said, yet in good man∣ners, and order, there must no more bee said, but only that the Proposer in all constant faithfullnesse is resolved to be, Your Honours in all devout and devoted Obedience, Thomas Ducket:
A Narrative of the Proceedings of Thomas Ducket Esq &c. THat the said Thomas Ducket,The Pro∣posers un∣dertaking. by his great charge and study in Natures operation, hath (by Gods assistance) discovered several rich, and profi∣table Secrets, Arts and Mysteries, for the Improvement of all sorts of Land, by destroying of all sorts of Weeds, Trash, Shrubs, and other Incumbrances, Raising of Waters, Creating of a new soil or manure; To∣gether with more expeditions cheap and easie actions, and motions to perform the same; And likewise for the improvement of Leather of all sorts, in excellen∣cy and perfection of Strength, Grain, and Colour, being designs of great honour and plenty for English People. The Real performance of which Inventions, first as to Land,The reali∣ty of his inventions for land attested by many per∣sons of ho∣nour and quality. was testified by Cer∣tificates under the hands of many persons of Honour and qualitie of several Counties unto you the Right Honourable Members of this present Par∣liament, not long before your Honours were disturbed, being in April the 23. 1653. for before those accidents, and alterations in State, your Petitioner did daily solicit the worthy and most renowned members of this Parliament then sit∣ting, that they would be pleas'd to peruse and take into consideration in the House, the Bill he had prepared by Council learned in the Law, to be passed in∣to an Act for improvement of Land. But multiplicity of State-affairs (as it seem'd) or else new inventions in these Septetrional Countries seeming strange,New in∣ventions being a wondr to the appre∣hension of some peo∣ple hath been a chief re∣mora. or else National Malediction did retard the settlement of such good fortune, notwithstanding the exact and clear descriptions of the particulars, and the con∣firmation of many honourable and worthy persons as aforesaid, who attested, and largely satisfied your Honours of the Proposer's ability to perform his underta∣kings: yet neverthelesse your Honours not putting a dispatch to so great a Na∣tional advantage, occasioned a doubtfulnesse in the Proposer, lest his publick ten∣ders, amongst the generality of people, might be reflected on him as nothing but pretences; and that he were not able to set forth any additional thing that were rich, and good for improvement of Land, more than what former ages, and pre∣sent time had, or have produced. And there upon the Prooser, minding the good of his Native Country, and the honour of his own reputation, to avoid all jealousies, mistakes, and controversies of any doubtful, captious persons, who through their own imbecillity might conceit that what he had so held forth were but a superficial shew, without any reality at all; or if he were a master of such skill,No cause of neglect∣ing so good a tender, for three reasons. that then it was bottomed beyond the reach of ordinary understan∣ding, and so deep, that it did require long considration, and State policie to dis∣cern the depth, scope and centre thereof; although the case is evident, clear, and void of all suspition and controversie, and would be speedily embraced in any Southern Nation, for these three reasons, viz. First, for that it cannot choose but be a universal benefit to any Nation. Secondly, because no Statesman, nor any belonging to them, or any other per∣son,
shall be charged with any cost, trouble, or damage, until he have a full knowledge, and possession of the skill. Thirdly, no person is, nor shall be compelled, without his especial desire and consent, to make use of any of the said Inventions, or to take a license for that purpose, neither is any man to be restrained by vertue of such an act, from making use of all, & all manner of courses in husbandry, Arts and Mysteries, that have ever formerly been used, or are at this present in common use and practice, neither de∣barred of any of their accustomed exercises, but only of those new discoveries, and additions to former practices, which are and shall be published and mani∣fested. Therefore to prevent these and such doubts, suppositions, and other obstructi∣ons, the Proposer having long since by his studies in the mysteries of Nature, ac∣quired a most strange, and unheard of secret, never before discovered, in this or former ages, which is of so high a degree of Consequence, in richnesse, and rarity of art,The Propo∣ser to con∣vince all dubious minds, and to make known his ability in Land, did demon∣strate his skill in the mystery of Leather. that for the convincing of all erroneous minds, thoughts and words, as to his ability in knowledge, He did by his new inventions, convert many score of raw hides, and skins into leather, without Bark of Oaks, Ash, or any other for∣merly used ingredients; as also did make leather of a more rich and profitable condition, than ever yet was known, by assisting, and bettering of all former known practices, with new means, and additional ingredients, and liquors to be mixed and compounded with bark of Oaks, and all others formerly used, which is, and may be performed easier, speedier, and with lesse charge than formerly: which did, doth, and may demonstrate his knowledge to be far more profound, and beyond the reach of all sorts of Artificers, although they have been Masters of such practice as hath ever been by tradition used since this part of the world was civilzed. The excel∣lent perfe∣ction which the Proposer hath at∣tained un∣to in the said art and myste∣ry. The clear∣nesse of the propo∣sers skill and abili∣ty.Yet notwithstanding the highest degree of perfection that they have attain'd unto by their long practice, by way of embleme and pattern, to make an uncon∣tradictable certainty in the judgement of all wise and judicious persons, the Pro∣poser having atchieved the knowledge, did produce that most admirable Master∣piece for all that are concerned in Leather, that thereby your Honours, and the world may know, that his reach and understanding in improvement of the ferti∣lity of all sorts of lands, doth, and may in all likelyhood in the particulars of his intended discoveries, as much surmount the practice of any Actors, and Au∣thors in Husbandry. And upon these grounds the Proposer took the pains to demonstrate the great Mystery for Leather, before he had any Act for the improvement of land: but if an Act for improvement of land had been granted, his actions had been so signi∣ficant to the purpose, beyond what is practised by others, as would have induced such a full belief with your Honours, or any other supreme persons authorized, that his own promise and assertion, would have supported his undertakings as to Leather, to be of such current truth, that his pains in setting forth a demonstra∣tion of tanning of Leather according to the new mystery, might have been spared as a needlesse impertinency. The Propo∣sers good will to be∣nefit his native Country, did cause him to neglect no opportuni∣ty to get a settlement of his busi∣nesse.But the Proposer observing the variety of minds, and tempers of people, and changes of government, with the like, did hold it necessary to make the world sensible of his abilities by those actions, as aforesaid, and then when he had crea∣ted so good a belief, it had been a great want of prudence and good mind in the Proposer, if he should have neglected his addresses to any supreme Authority
that next ensued your Honours. First, in regard that he was stricken in yeares: Next, because he had a great zeal to lend his assistance to help his own Native Countrey, before any forein Nation, and some other causes supported by the rule of discretion, occasioned him in an elaborate way to make his addresses unto eve∣ry sort of supreme Authority, from the dissolution of your Honours as aforesaid until this present time; and that he might be more certain of gaining an authori∣ty for the exercising of what he so held forth, he first cleared all doubts and queries by significant demonstration of several parcels of Leather so tanned and tawed; and likewise by certificates thereupon from most of the chief Tanners, and other tradesmen as to Leather, of several Counties in and about London, to his late Highnesse Oliver Lord Protector, and his Council, and likewise to the Commit∣tee for trade, then in power, the which Committee by order summoned a nume∣rous company of Tanners, and other tradesmen as to Leather, to give their ap∣probation, and testimony of the said Leather, the which persons so summoned, did not only under their hands, but likewise themselves in person, affirm and testifie of the goodnesse of the said Leather, and of the ability of the said Thomas Ducket to perform his undertakings, and of the great benefit that would arise there∣by to the three Nations, and earnestly requested a speedy settlement of the pre∣misses. By the means of which proceedings,His late Highnesse Oliver Lord Pro∣tector's grant of Patents. his late Highnesse Oliver Lord Protector with his Council were so fully satisfied herein, that his Highnesse forthwith granted the said Thomas Ducket two several Patents for the sole exercise and be∣nefit of his said inventions for improvement of Land and Leather for fourteen years; which upon consideration, and perusal by the said Thomas Ducket's Coun∣sel in the Law, they were found not to be of sufficient power and validitie to make him a secure title, by reason of the multitude of the people he was to deal with, as to land, and certain Statutes, and especially some Statutes as to Leather, prohibiting the use of any other liquors or ingredients, but Bark of Oaks, and other ingredients then in use, and limiting set times in Tannage; the maker of such Statutes (by all likelihood) not imagining that any better way or inventi∣on could be found out, by the means whereof it proved this nations unhappiness,Reasons why the said Pa∣tents were of no va∣lidity. to be suppressed, delayed, & hazarded in the hope of the accommodation of those rich & precious benefits that might then speedily have ensued by power of Broad-Seal Patents, if those foresaid old acts had not frustrated the progresse and exer∣cise of the premises. For although it fell out, that those old barres in Law proved to be against the law of right and reason, yet neverthelesse there was no remedy to avoid the same, although it were to the daily losse and prejudice of the people, and must have so continued, until the errors of those former Parliament lawes were through the prudence of some new Parliament-Magistrates, discerned, deserted, and repeal∣ed, to make way for better opportunities, and then the Proposer by a Parliamen∣tary act impowred. And upon these, and some other accounts and procrastinations, the said Tho∣mas Ducket was in reason necessitated to forbear the discovery of his designed in∣tentions, and so did untill there was a Parliament assembled at Westminster, in September 1656. where then the Proposer after addressing himself and his cause unto them, then after sufficient debate, and through the virtue of several Certi∣ficates from many worthy Patriots conducing to land, as also the new testimony of his late Highnesse Oliver Lord Protector and his Council, as to Land and Lea∣ther,
as also the Certificate of the chiefest Tanners,The Tan∣ners ad∣dresse and certificates to the Par∣liament and Com∣mittees for Trade, of the Propo∣sers ability and other tradesmen as to Leather, recommended unto the said Parliament, together wih the appearance of numerous companies of Tanners, and other dealers in Leather, at several times, did make their personal addresse unto the whole body of the house of Parlia∣ment in that behalf, and also when occasion required did present themselves at other times, unto several Committees of Parliament, and at last through very much inveterate trouble, perplexity, tediousnesse incident to English Proceedings; afterwards this ensuing report was made in answer to a grand Committee of that Parliament, by power of an Order granted by them unto a Sub-Commit∣tee, the words being thus returned, viz. The Report. The re∣port of a Committee of Parlia∣ment.IN observance of an Order of this Committee, bearing date the 23. day of December last, we have examined, and considered of the proposals and new in∣ventions of Thomas Ducket Esq for the improvement of all sorts of lands, and also for the converting all sorts of raw hides, and skins into leather, without Bark of Oaks, or other usual ingredients; & upon conference with him, his reasons and demonstrations hath given us good satisfaction, as well of his abilities, as of the benefit that may come to this Commonwealth thereby, and we are the more in∣duced to believe the same, for that his Highnesse and Council have certified on his behalf, and lkewise many other persons of worth and quality in several Counties to the same effect. And we do farther report, that we have supervised his bills for improvement of Lands and Leather, and have made many alterations and restrictions therein, and do humbly conceive that the said Thomas Duckets undertakings deserve all due incouragement, that this Commonwealth may enjoy the benefit thereof. Dated the 1. of May. 1657 The Committee con∣sisted of 5 or 6 but any three of two were im∣powred to report. Henry Pickering. Richard Timbs. Robert West. The bills likewise prepared by the said Commi tee. Sir Hen∣ry Picke∣ring order∣ed to move it in the house.After the return of this report from the Sub-Committee unto the Grand Committee, together with the two bills for Land and Leather, as they were prepared and made fit to be enacted, it was then resolved, and so ordered by that Grand Committee, that the then Henry Pickering Esq now Henry Pickering Knight, one of the Sub-Committees (whose name is unto the said report) should with all convenient speed, wait the House daily for an opportunity, and there to move the Right Honourable Speaker Sir Thomas Widdringto, to give way for the publication of those bills so prepared; and the said Honourable Speaker was made acquainted therewith, who was very writing to give way to the said Sir Henry Pickerings motion, in causing the bills to be read, and he in his loyalty and goodness to the Wealpublick (being well satisfied of the proposers ability, and the great advantage that hereby might arise to the Nation) was contented to assist those proceedings; and rather then the business should receive any delay by the motion of Sir Henry Pickering, he was honourably pleased that those bills should be moved as private bills by himself;Cause why the busi∣ness was not setled. but just at the time when most of the Members were acquainted with these Proceedings, and were in a readiness to give audience as to a settlement, then it so pleased God that the said Thomas
Ducket was visited with sicknesse, so that he could not attend the House, but was forced to let his business lye dormant and proceed no farther; in which time of his sicknesse, the Parliament was first adjourned, and after their next sitting suddainly dissolved; And now through providence your Honours (with whom were my first proceedings and addrees) being reinvested with the Pow∣er and Authority, from whence this Nation may receive those fortunate succes∣ses which are to be presented by the Proposer, who hath the good fate once more to make his Addresses to your Honours, although at present your Honours are full of publick employment,The designs are of so great worth that they merit the result of the Parliament, more than any other businesse except the se∣curity of the Nation. yet the Proposer well knowing (that setting aside the security of the Nation) there is not any thing in the House in agitati∣on, that may better advance a flourishing plentie to your Honours and the peo∣ple, than the entertainment of the premisses, which in the peircing eye of Pru∣dence, is a most notable, pretious, publick business, and cannot be denied in the Reason, Judgement, and Wisdom of your Honours, although this Nation is haunted with some injurious ignorant persons, that will not stick to affirm it to be but a private business, in regard that the Owner, Founder, and Messenger of this mystery, lays claim (according to the Law of Nations) to be gratified for fourteen years with some small diminutive reward; whose penurious unwor∣thy condition'd language,Sordid Calum∣niations by De∣tractors. or customary equivocation to quibble this Land out of a Success and Character, must needs consist of a pestiferous male∣diction to all ingenuity, insomuch that they do endeavour to blast the glorious Law of National requital of laborious Masters in profitable new discove∣ries, with the odium of Monopolies,And other Ca∣villations. unless that such invertors of rich enterprises and high discoveries, do give the honour and profit thereof, unto the Members of State, and be content to stand unto their reversi∣on; and questionless there are many, that will whisper some great mn to that purpose, although those so whispered cannot but discern, that they, with those pickthank Flatteries, would fain allure Magistracy, into a Monopolizing those atchievments which they never sought nor sweat for. And if your Honours do by Argument and Reason contradict those Motioners, as to a course improper, yet they, or such as they are, will start some other quaery, saying, Why should not the Inventor disclose all his skill and manner of action, as well as demon∣stration (unto some great Members of Parliament) in every particular,Reasons that the Proposers undertakings are not to be discovered to any Members of Parliament, or others, with∣out a settlement first granted. before that he hath an Act passed? And that it were good policy in any Committee to urge and press the Proposer home to that point. Now then, when any of your Honours do reply, (as questionless you may and will) That, if that the skill were made known to any Members of State, that then, they the said Members are bound, by virtue of their trust, to publish all politick profits to the Nation, without any imposition of payment for any skill, that is before-hand made known, unto their representative, who, by receiving such intelligence from the Inventor, were thereby disabled to make a Law to that effect: And that the Master of those Mysteries may better dispense with the breach of promise unto his particular;☜ than the whole Nation with the trust reposed in any of its Members.A discovery in reason not to be requested be∣fore the settle∣ment. Again it may be answered (questionless) that the Proposer will not yield unto any such thing, in that the likelyhood of the profits of his discoveries, do farr surmount (as to the benefit of the Common-wealth) the valew of ten, twenty, or forty Gentlemens Estates, setting their places or power aside: And again, that those persons that are studious in any mental mysteries, and are of perfect knowledge therein, doubtless are so Judicious, that they will not deliver their principles
to the possession of others upon any such uncertainties,The inconve∣nience that may arise to the Proposer and others by making a dis∣covery to any without an Act. nor will they be guided in any unstable course, for fear of losing their benefits, and making them∣selves a simple President to other Authors and Founders; neither will it become Members of State (in point of honour of the whole house) to motion any de∣sign unto the Proposer concerning his inventions, wherein there were any doubt of hazard; and for him the Proposer, to submit to such adventures, is too much below the Honour of a person so endowed. And thus with trouble and woful experience, the Proposer is able to Cha∣racterize the disserviceable part of those puzzling Incndiaries, that out of ran∣cour will endeavour to forestall all good actions and intentions, whereby your Honours may easily discern, that their prating and practice hath a great affinity, with the skill and artifice of Achitophel; these their agitations plainly shewing, that such persons are none of those godly wise men,What kind of persons Detra∣ctors are, and from whence their natures are, and what is predominate over them, and what they are addicted to. who, as the Scripture saith, doe command the stars; For certainly, these wretches, for want of Grace, do permit malevolent planets to predominate over them, even to the naturalizing of their minds, to the love of mischief to others, and the impoverishing of all but themselves, they being owners of some small heap of drossie substance, so much as doth advance and support them so to overlook other mens matters as to breed disturbances, controversies, and cruelties, or else they would not pro∣ject, and monopolize so many insolencies, to divert the Settlement of Plentie. And certainly those that have been adverse to these proceedings are none of the wisest, in seeking to hinder themselves from the good successe of profitable inventions atcheived by ingenuity; it may be they may be wittie, craftie, subtile, and inplacably politick, but yet want Judgement to discern, that there is no profit on the face of the earth, that ta∣keth his first entrance of settlement, with so little charge and pains as new dis∣covered mysteries; For in all sea practices and proceedings, and all land affairs and actions, the events require charge, time, venture, losse and ha∣zard,No person at one penny charge in set∣ling the disco∣very but the Proposer. ☞ and many times ill successe doth crosse those enterprises: But in the en∣trance of these proceedings, to accommodate the Nation with knowledge, there is not one penny losse, not a sheet of paper to any Clerk, nor fee to a sub∣ordinate Officer, but what must and shall be satisfied by the Proposer, after that your Honours have breathed out the concluding vote of an Act for the establish∣ment. It hath been reported, that Charls the fifth Emperour, and Philip of Spain called by his Subjects Philip the wise,☞ and other Monarchs great in wisdome and power, said, it was very fitting that if it did so fall out that any person re∣lating to them, did pretend a new discovery of any new Art or Science, or profi∣table Manufactory, if it were tendred without a charge, or cost at first entrance and entertainment thereof, that all such affairs should be lovingly embraced by all men of reason, first for avoyding the discouragement of industry, Secondly, for that if any one rarity of new skill, or but any part of a special skill prove current, feasible, laudable, and profitable to a Common-wealth, then if one of twenty such proffers did thrive effectually and prosperously, the trouble of Settlement was recompensed more than an hundred times treble; yet this Pro∣posers designs being many, and several, and also visible and perfect, to the eyes of sence, and ears of understanding, and as freely proffered without any cost as can be expected, have been retarded in the setling, by the means of such per∣sons
as have, and will, if they may be permitted and believed, still endeavour to stupifie the ears of Authority with false pleadings, to the great losse and incon∣venience of the people, and instead thereof gain the Nation a disgrace, being a rhing very unreasonable and shameful. Now if these Emblems of the seditious and spightful blasters of the blossoms and flowers of welfare, will not abate their crosse resolutions,A caution not to regard such Calumniators. then may they range where they please, and sow tares where they list, provided that your Ho∣nours will vouchsafe, to make it one of your principal businesses to supervise the laborious works and producements of the Proposer, with more eager conspicui∣ty than formerly, and then he is confident your Honours shall find his perfor∣mances, to be a sufficient antidote against the putrified Air of those, by whose breath tares (as aforesaid) and other weeds and land impediments would be continued and increased, if your Honours prevent it not,The Proposer stands upon his credit and reputation in justification of his businesse. ☜ and take hold of oc∣casion, and contemn such peevish Criticks, in owning these proposals as a pub∣lick business of Parliament, whose profitable effects to the Nation may well support it with the true title of the same, although the Proposer will not ex∣clude himself, and the name of Duckets, of that Honour and share that the Laws of God and Man affords them, which must be so if he would complie with an Ignoramus to himself and Friend, in disclaiming a moderate satisfacti∣on, which no way can arise unto him and them by any false, uncouth, sinister, delusion or evasion, as will presently be made manifest for satisfaction of your Honours, and for calming the boysterous tempestuous winds of all that are en∣vious, needie, greedy or factious, unless (the Author of all mischief) be in it. Certainly all opposites (though never so ill minded to others) would gladly have payment for any goods they sell, and reciprocal returns for civilities,Every man will look  a Reward  what he dh sell, or doe for any man. fa∣vours and Friendships, with a full recompence for any good service, if they be of a capacity in any of these (as seldom they are) and according to that the Pro∣poser doth but expect to be respected with some little and mean requital, farr beneath the desert of his great service to the Commonwealth, in which Proceed∣ings no man can be jealous of any falshood, whereby he might delude, and draw the Nation to raise him a profit farr transcending the benefit of his disco∣veries during the fourteen years; for if his designs are of little consequence, small profit, and hardly of any use, then hath he with disgrace lost all his for∣mer time, and charge, yet none but himself damnifid. And if they prove mo∣derately profitable, and prosperously worthy of use,The Proposers reward will be according to the merit of his designs. and of some sufficient be∣nefit, then will the shape, size, and quantity of his reward be suitable according to the beneficial assistance the Weal-publick receiveth. But if his designed dis∣coveries should prove to be of a most vast valew in additional honour to your Honours, and a wealthy prosperity to the Commonwealth, then by a true rule of proportion, a fair and fitting well-deserved honour,If his designs prove suce∣full and good his  ought  ac∣cordingy. and large recompence the Proposer doth conceive himself (against the World) to be a meritorious de∣server of. And if the numerous small compositions for Licences from all that make use of his discoveries should arise to great sums or Mulcts, yet in despight of contradiction the performer is a well deserving owner thereof, and question∣less will shew himself as able in distribution of what he hath gained, upon chari∣table good wayes and uses,The  as he was industrious in atchieving and accomplish∣ing the possession of the same; for who doth know but that he is naturally ad∣dicted unto the relief of the poorer sort, and the practice of laudable actions
therewith in some eminent degree of Religious pious charity, such as may be as great a president in good works, and gratious liberality, as he hath been studious in advancing welfare and plentie. A strange case that such wealthy de∣signs should be retarded by de∣tracting self-ended people. The Proposer will not sub∣ject himself to any disgrace, to be a discou∣ragement to in∣genious persons for the future. The Poposers good will to benefit his Na∣tive Countrey demonstrated by keeping so long his secrets undiscovered to forein Na∣tions. The Proposers studies and na∣tural inclina∣tions conside∣red, why may not God blesse this Na∣tion as well as others to breed a person of re∣markable parts fit perpetually to be mmori∣zed?Is it not then strange that upon these weak barres of persons indigent in dis∣cretion, or the like incidences, or Epitomies of envy and wretchednesse as are a∣fore described, that the Proposers designes might then be raised to the high name of a special publick businesse, and not otherwise? This is very rigid in those that would endeavour to have your Honours adhere therewith, but must necessarily be a great debasing of the Proposers discretion, and very much beneath any Natu∣ralist that hath atchieved to perfection in smaller mysteries, and therefore he cannot submit to such an ignominie, without a foul scorn and disdain therein to be guilty, as also by such actions to become a discourager of any Academick, or other ingenuous persons, who in this, or ensuing ages, shall, or may attain unto eminent knowledge in the mysteries of nature, or the like. The Poposer hopeth, that he deserveth better things than these intricacies of his native Countrey, in reference to his good intentions of their future prosperi∣ty, as also his care of their honour, they being so dilatory in the settlement of their own welfare. Yet hath the Proposer hitherto had the patience not to send his discoveries into any other Nation, although often solicited to that purpose by several agents of those forein parts, that would have raised thereby their own riches, and advanced their pleasure in farther laughter and derision at the people of this Nation, for slighting and letting passe the opportunity of every new re∣nowned enterprize. For it hath been noted, that many nations and territories of the world have produced some persons of singularity in all arts, sciences, faculties and callings, and all derived from the Meridian of invention; the which illustrious excellence of persons renowned, have adorned most part of the universe with the splendent glitter of glorious discoveries, their names and qualities needing no recital; for that no intelligible person is ignorant of their particular excellence, in Wisdome and Knowledge; and seeing that it hath pleased God to bless other parts of the world with messengers of transcendent gifts, why then should Eng∣land be obnoxious to their own honour and profit in neglecting the employment of the Proposer? whose intellectuals were ever naturally from the spring of his youth, addicted to the love of profitable rarities, and new inventions in the The∣orick part of Elements and temperaments, and the methods of practice, with as much willingness to enrich his native Countrey, in resembling former founders of high and mighty things. Yet with all humble obedience in his submissive ap∣prehension, he hath aimed and endeavoured at knowledge, with as much ear∣nestness and eagerness as to his undertakings are recited, with as faithfull inten∣tion, as any of those surmounting persons that acquired to much fame and glory to themselves and their Native Countries. The which your honours may experi∣mentally know by making use of the Proposer, who is able to fill up the room and places left void and barren, with the fulness of skill, and better advantage in husbandry, and other mysteries and manufactories which were left at too low a gage of perfection by former discoverers; the which may by vertue of the Pro∣posers care be more perfectly established and setled, and thereby as he hath had place, liberty and room left him for such performance that others could not do: so when he shall have perfected what hitherto hath been left undone in the pre∣mises, he certainly then shall justly merit a place of remembrance in those lists
and rolls in which learned Authors and Historians have recorded the honour and dignity of former renowned Discoverers, the which preferment is one of the guerdons desired by Naturalists, they having felicity in fame beyond the posses∣sion of Riches. Now if these motives of truth and reason may occasion these humble motions to be in some convenient time dispatched and setled,The great ho∣nour and profit which the ho∣nourable Mem∣bers of Parlia∣ment will at∣tract by a spee∣dy settlement of the premises. then will your Honours be made famous with the glory of all those prosperous agitations and descripti∣ons, together with all sort of satisfactions, which are at large described in this ensuing addresse; to the end that your Honours may be fully satisfied of those rich land affairs, whose wealthy income will in many degrees surmount the in∣digency which this Nation is often incident unto; and the real assurance there∣of will appear more evident by your Honours perusal of this following descri∣ption, whereof this first part hath relation unto, which will in truth and reason outbear all misconstructions, sordid suggestions and pretences, and all such ma∣lign Incendiaries, as do, as aforesaid, endeavour to divert the laudable intenti∣ons of the most renowned Magistrates,Any Honoura∣ble Member of Parliament may receive ample satisfa∣ction in the premises in less than an houres time. from settlement of any great and pub∣lick good or benefit, which is like to ensue to the Commonwealth in general, and to the particular honour of those who intend to be the chief promoters thereof, who may receive ample satisfaction by proof, as to Land, and experi∣mental demonstration as to Leather, arguments to opposition, and response to queries in all the aforesaid passages in about an houres time, if cause there be that any Honourable Member require the same. And now the Proposer having given a sufficient account of his proceedings, humbly craveth your Honours favour to spare a small time in perusal of what is hereafter to be said; which questionlesse will induce as great a willingnesse in all worthy Patriots to countenance, and further a speedy settlement of the pre∣mises, for the benefit of their respective Countries, as was performed by his late Highnesse Oliver Lord Protector, and prudent Council, in their grant of Patents, as was before expressed. And by such a settlement the Proposer will be cleared of the Aspersions of various censurers, who often make doubts and suggestions by reason of the Proposers many expressions and writings, and that he hath been so long in performance of what he hath held forth;Reasons why there hath hi∣therto been no performance of what is held forth. not considering that it was divers Alterations in State, Barrs in Old Lawes, Mortality of some gratious Friends to good works, Sickness in the Proposer, and sundry other pro∣crastinations, which hindred and delayed the prosecution, and actual perfor∣mance of the premises, and not any failing, or disability in the Proposer, who hath followed his agitations with so much eagerness, that it hath stirred up ma∣ny detractors, who out of envy to such high undertakings, breath out trifling susurrations against the Proposers person and undertakings;Depravers ob∣jections an∣swered. and others ambi∣tious not to be outstript in Ingenuity, or to see another mans increase of honour, express and cast forth strange, and uncouth prevarications, with private emulati∣ons, that if not discerned, might corrode the hold this Nation might take of this present opportunity, in advancing their greater plenty, which they themselves might live to see, after authority is granted to the Proposer, and other Nations prevented in their hope of Englands declination thereof, as they have formerly done Columbus, and many other Ministers of profit, which in this case would ap∣pear more strange, for that the charge of acting, performing, publishing,☜ and gi∣ving possession of the premises, will come clear to the Nation, without the cost of one penny, and the charge incident to the settlement will be very little:
and moreover the Proposer will carry on his designes and undertakings, until they be clearly discovered, at his own charge; for he stands upon the points of his reputation, and just meaning in these particulars, and all others, as he hath done all his life time,The Proposer renounces all bye ends or fa∣vour, other than a legal settlement. (if not mistaken) and renounces all benefit from any person in the world, in reference to his undertakings, with as much detestation as is proper to the most worthy Obliging person in the world, or any favour, other than that Law of fourteen yeares privilege, for the Exercise of his Inventi∣ons, as is peculiar in such Cases, for the incouragement of all those who by their Studies and Endeavours, have attained unto high and laudable discoveries in Elemental mysteries. And as much as lies in the power of the Proposer, touching himself and his designs, the people of this Nation shall not be guilty of the first president of in∣gratitude, and suppression of any flourishing prosperity, which might illustrate the glory of this and other Nations: Therefore God forbid that the arguments of self-ended and detracting persons, or any such that want parts to understand Mysteries; or vulgar wits, that love old customes or dull actions, more than profit; or spleeny Cynicks, who will speak against all things, and like nothing but what they do themselves; or any such opposites, who may now make it their businesse to obstruct the Proposers proceedings;What mischief Depravers may do in a Nation. should divert, and prevail with your Honours, to let such an Emolument and Ornament of a Nation fall to the ground; especially considering that Store can be no Sore, and that there is suffi∣cient need for profitable supply, and no want of lawfull power of prudent Ma∣gistrates; and under favour of your Honours, no lack of serenity or ability in the Proposer, to give his Native Country the first Livery and Seisin of those rich in∣ventions, wherewith he is indued. Neither are there any barres in Law, or any obstacles to blind the Nation from the lively view thereof, but only the damp and foggy air arising from dulness, or the dark clouds of brow-bent malice, or the faithlesse, fruitlesse blastings of incredulity, or such like ill-aspected motions; unlesse that any such barking and bawling depravers, can face to face, before the Honourable Members of Parliament, disprove, or make appear any thing against the faithfull Integrity, Skill, Knowledge, Person, Parts or Undertakings of the Proposer: but if such persons shall not ground their opposition on Truth and Reason, but think to bear it out with a liberty derived from falshood and igno∣rance, they will find themselves deceived, and in danger to runne the hazard of bringing a lasting disgrace and Odium upon themselves,The Proposers defiance to such Depravers. for unworthily endeavou∣ring to obstruct and hinder the increase of such honour and fertility, as might be advanced to the enriching of your Honours Treasury, and the Commonwealths future happinesse and prosperity. And by this means the expectation of all wor∣thy persons, may be satisfied; the Pest of envy, antidoted; the Author, and all other persons studious in good works, encouraged; your Honours, eternally magnified; and this our Air and Climate purged of all the contagious infections of Spirits Malevolent to high and worthy principles; wherein they have not abi∣lities of apprehension to discern the various mysteries of Nature, which the vast world plentifully affordeth unto all those who are serious Observers of her Es∣sence and Deity, and diligent Searchers into the Multiplicity of her Natural Ef∣fects and Causes, with her other Contingencies: which the Proposer all his life time having been studious, and conversant in, hath attained to the knowledge and perfection, chiefly of these ensuing Designes, and many others not herein ex∣pressed: which if hereafter entertained and settled, may as well as the rest, be very advantagious to the Commonwealth.
The particular Heads of which Inventions, contained in the Bills aforementioned, for the Improvement of all sorts of Land and Leather, are as followeth; FIrst, The said Thomas Ducket undertaketh to take away for ever,1. The Proposers undertakings for Land. To destroy all manner of Trsh. the greatest part of the prejudice and damage which is caused in Land, of several sorts, by reason of Heath or Ling, Fearn or Brakes, Rushes, Sedges, Reeds, Thistles, Nettles, Mosse, Broom, Furze or Gorse, Brambles, Bryers, Blackthorns, and other Incumbrances, destructive to the growth and goodnesse of Corn and Grasse, or prejudicial and hurtful to Pasture, Meadow, and arable Lands. Secondly, To improve, and inrich the value and goodnesse of Land,2. To improve Shallow Soil. where the Turf is shallow by reason of Gravel, Sand, Rock, Clunch or Chalk, lying too near the Superficies of the Earth, that there is not a sufficient depth of Soyl to be plowed; so that it is altogether unprofitable Land for Corn, neither will it bear any considerable quantity of Grasse. The which Improvement is and may be per∣formed, without the usual great charge and paines of carrying Lime or Dung of Cattel upon the same. Thirdly, To keep a great part of all hilly, dry, rising grounds, by water,3. To keep moist hilly dry grounds. more moist and fertile; not with any great chargeable Engines, Leaden Pipes, Pumps, or any sort of Mills or Water houses, or any new way now in practice, or held forth; but by ways & means slight, cheap and easie, by ordering of Lands in various shapes, figures, and proportions, for compassing, and gainecoping the drift and course of Waters; and by Engines and Instruments of small value, from five shil∣lings price, unto five pounds and upwards, portable for either man, horse, or cart, according to their several sizes, as the depth of the water, and the height of the ground shall require; which will carry up, and gain advantage of waters so much, as thereby Lands may be soakned, and kept more moist and fertile, and dry places in Summer may be supplyed with water. Fourthly, To make a sort of rich Soyl fit for Agriculture,4. To fertilize Land with a new Manure. and Manuring of ground, much of the nature and effects of Lime, or Dung of Cattel, where Lime or Dung of Cattel is scarce, and is to be performed with small charge and paines. ANd also the said Thomas Ducket undertaketh, (whereas Bark of Oaks, Ash,The Proposers undertakings for Leather. ☜ Sumack, Galls, Salt and Allom, being the principal ingredients now used in Tannage, are very scarce and dear, and likewise harsh and corrosive) To dis∣cover and teach all Tradesmen as to Leather, a profound Art and Mystery, never before practised in this Commonwealth; First, to make Leather without any the Liquors or Ingredients now in use,1. To tanne Lea∣ther without Bark, &c. in shorter time, and with lesse charge, far to exceed all former Tannage, in ex∣cellency of Grain and Colour; and more lasting, firm and substantial, fit for all manner of service, according to the nature, sizes, and degrees of the hides and skins so Tanned and Tawed. Secondly, If any Tradesman as to Leather, be desirous for custome sake, or some other private ends or reasons, still to make use of Bark, or any oher Ingre∣dients,
now in practice;To make Lea∣ther by mixing his new Ingre∣dients with the old. The Liquors and Ingredients invented and found out by the said Thomas Ducket, are of such virtue and quality, that if by his di∣rections some of them be mixed and compounded with the former used Ingre∣dients, they will make farr better Leather, and in shorter time, than is, or can be made, by the only and single use of Bark, Sumack, or any other Ingredients now in common practice, and the harsh and corrosive qualities of the old Ingredi∣ents, will be very much diverted and abated by mixture of the new. Thirdly, the said Thomas Ducket will discover Liquors of such rare perfecti∣on, that will clarify and prepare all sorts of raw Hides and Skins, for more speedy and better Tannage; Either in Liquors and Ingredients of his own in∣vention; Or in Liquors of his own mixed and compounded with those former∣ly used;To prepare raw Hides and Skins for more speedy and bet∣ter Tannage. Or in Liquors made with Barke, Sumack, and the rest now in Com∣mon practice; And further the said Liquors are of such influence, that they will relax and soften the Natural hardnesse in raw Hides and Skins, and cause the Callus and Gelly in them, to be more expeditiously digested in the Tanning or Tawing; And moreover the said Liquors will prevent the putrifaction inci∣dent to great Hides intended for Soal Leather, for the Tanners by Stifeling them on great heaps close together, do taint and perish them on the Grayn side, with a rottennesse, as is apparent by the easy cracking of them if forced or bended. The Proposer undertakes to dscover his new Arts.A l which said Arts, Mysteries, Secrets, and Inventions, both for Improvement of Land and Leather, the said Thomas Ducket undertaketh to make known in print or otherwise, for the publique good of this Common-wealth, and to direct and teach the method, use, and practice of them. The real performance of which Inventions, are sufficiently attested, and clear∣ed as aforesaid, and need not so great Evidence, but that any rational person will Conceive that the undertaker is well versed in the Mysteries of Nature, and able to perform many rarities of skill and knowledge for the Improve∣ment of Land;☞ seeing that by his study in Natures Operation, hee hath attained unto the whole scope and body, of the Science and Mystery, for converting all sorts of raw Hides and Skins into Leather, beyond all expectation and proba∣bility, as is actually made apparent, for that the make thereof, transcends in such a degree of goodnesse, all former Tannage, as never was performed, or accompli∣shed, by the most profound Ingenuities of this or former Ages; And it is appa∣rent that much Land continueth sterril and barren, for want of help to assist Nature, Land holders and Land-owners having been hitherto as Stupid and Negligent in Improvements, as Tanners and others were in Improvement of Leather. And if there may be now a speedy settlement of the premises, it will be an Extraordinary help and benefit to all Tanners,A present con∣veniency for Tanners. and other Tradesmen as to Leather, who will thereby save great Charge and paines, which otherwise they must be at in seeking for Bark; and other Ingredients, to furnish them∣selves withall, which are both Scarce and Costly. That therefore the said Thomas Ducket in recompence of his great charge and paines, and love to his Native Country, and for the incouragement of all ingeni∣ous Artists for the future, may be impowred to have the Sole exercise and bene∣fit of his said Inventions,Grant of Set∣tlement. for improvement of Land and Leather, for fowerteen years, according to the Laws and Statutes of this and other civil Nations. And may have power and authority during the said Term, to grant Licences
to all persons within the three Nations and the Dominions thereto belonging,Humble moti∣ons and argu∣mental reasons why there can be no good set∣tlement with∣out sufficient penalties. to practise his said inventions, which are new, and never before in present or frequent occupation, in the same Method, Form, and Manner, with such ad∣ditions and alterations; And although the benefit of them be never so great, yet no man is compelled as in such cases in other Nations, to make use of any of the said Inventions, but left at will and pleasure to be Pilots to their own wills. And these rich designs aforementioned,☜ which may so much advance the Commonwealth, being the Rights, and due Treasure of the Proposer, and no-other person having an interest and property in them, but himself;These Reasons why the Propo∣ser ought to have good pe∣nalties are not included in the Bills. that there∣fore in all Equity and Reason, it is requisite for him by way of Treaty with the honourable Members, humbly to lay claim to some fitting assurance, and square and legal conditions, thereby to be certain of some reasonable satisfacti∣on, for those wealthy benefits, which are by him to be presented to those per∣sons, who are concerned to make use of them, and therefore in all Right and Equity, your Honours cannot but grant him such a power, as is congruent and incident to any venturers, who have used great industry, and spent their best times and fortunes in bringing from forein parts of the World into their Na∣tive Country, some enriching Merchandize, at which time the Owners there∣of are at liberty to make their own conditions, with those they furnish; and therefore accordingly that the Proposer may not be defeated of the honour and reward which ought justly to accrue to him, for his new Inventions, which are of farr greater value than any kind of Merchandize, and made ridiculous to the discouragement of ingenious Artists for the future, and this Nation subject to the evil effects of ingratitude, and likewise this Act made invalid by evill-minded persons, who although their composition for Licences, will be little or nothing in comparison of their benefit; yet most people are of such perverse and ill-disposed natures, that they will rather indeavour deceitful practices, than be conformable to the Laws; Therefore to prevent such fallacious people, and that his recompence and satisfaction, for his great Charge, Study, and pains, may be answerable to his Merits and Deserts, and that he may have a secure Title, the Proposer under your Honours favour, by way of civil bargain,Why the penal∣ties ought to be so great. doth humbly lay claim to such good penalties, as are hereafter to be named, wherein there cannot be a wrong or prejudice to any that mean well, for that all good-minded people, will not make use of the Proposers skill without due Licence, and therefore regard not penalties be they never so great, and those who are of small ability will never run the hazard of them, and moreover those persons who are unjustly and fraudulently intended, may be better ordered and subdued with fear of good penalties, for it will suit with your Honours pru∣dence, and wisdome, that those persons who regard nor fear either Laws or Honesty, but wilfully contemn and break them, should be severely punished, and largely suffer; for the use of Iustice, will be prevented by a well setled Justice. And therefore that the penalty of forty shillings may be imposed upon all per∣sons whatsoever, for every Acre of Land, whereon they shall without Licence
first had and obteined from the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns,Penalties for Land. use or pract∣ise any of his wayes, means, methods, or directions, for the improvement of Pasture, Meadow, and arable grounds, in any of the particulars aforesaid; And also the Sum of twenty shillings, upon every Acre of Land, for every years continuing the use of them (without Licence) after Conviction; And also that the penalty of twenty pounds, may be imposed upon all persons that shall make use, or exercise (without Licence) any of his Engines, to carry up wa∣ter to any Cities, Towns, Villages, particular Houses, or any other places whatsoever, other than for Improvement of hilly dry grounds in manner as a∣foresaid; And twenty shillings for every days continuing the use of them (without Licence) after Conviction. And moreover to prevent unjust and indirect practices by Tanners, that the penalty of one hundred pounds, may be imposed upon any Tanner, or other person, that shall (without Licence first had and obteined from the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns) make,Penalties for Leather. use, or practise, all or any part of his wayes, means, directions, Liquors, or Ingredients for the Tanning, Tawing, or preparing of Leather as aforesaid; And forty shillings for every dayes continuing the use of them (without Licence) after the first Conviction. How the penal∣ties ought to be recovered.And that the Offenders in any the premisses aforesaid may upon Oath of two Witnesses, before one or two Justices of the Peace be Convicted. And that all Justices of the Peace, may be impowred and required upon such Conviction, to issue out their Warrants to the Constables of the place where the Offenders live, for the levying by distresse, the aforesaid penalties. And that no person whatsoever (may without Licence as aforesaid) alter, Counterfeit, Change, or falsify, either by addition to, or substraction from the same,No false Pre∣tenders or Counterfeitors. or other alteration, all or any the aforesaid Inventions, Engines, In∣struments, or other utensils, Manure, Liquors, or Ingredients, either for im∣provement of Land or Leather as aforesaid, thereby to pretend him or them∣selves, to be the Inventors or Devisors thereof, upon pain of the forfeitures and payments aforesaid. That whereas Printers, Staioners, Booksellers, and other persons, may by false and counterfeit Books and Copies very much wrong and prejudice,Penalties for Printers, &c. not only the said Thomas Ducket, but likewise the Commonwealth; That to pre∣vent such inconveniences, which may thereby arise, a good penalty to the va∣lue of one thousand pounds, may be imposed upon them, for printing or putting to sale (without Licence) any of his Books or Copies of Directions, either for improvement of Land in any the particulars aforesaid; Or for Tanning, Tawing,To be recove∣red by Action of Debt. or preparing of Leather as aforesaid; And also to forfeit five pounds for every Book or Copy of direction, which they shall print or expose to sale, after the first Discovery and Conviction; And the said penalties to be recove∣red by Action of Debt in any Court of Record in the three Nations, where no essoyn or wager of Law shall be admitted or allowed them. And that the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns, may by warrant from a Justice of the Peace,Liberty to make search in case of suspition for discovery of Offenders. to a Constable or other Officer, make search for the dis∣covering of such persons, as they shall suspect to make use of any of his Inven∣tions, either for improvement of Land, or Leather, (without Licence as a∣foresaid.) That all the penalties and forfeitures aforesaid, are to be divided into three
equal parts, one third part to your Honours, to be paid into the Exchequer,Penalties di∣vided to three parts. one other third part thereof, to be to the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns, and the other third part to the Informer. And now your Honours having heard,Alluding his Inventions to Merchandary commodities as a rational inducement though no part of the Bill. The small and reasonable sa∣tisfaction which the Pro∣poser expects for his disco∣veries. what penalties have been humbly de∣sired, with Reasons why they ought to be so great, yee will bethink with your selves, what satisfaction and reward, it is fit for the Proposer to expect, and in this case to satisfie your Honours, the Proposer doth not intend, that his recompence and gain, shall compare with a Venturer, or Merchant, that brings in Gold, Silver, Bullion, pretious Stones, or Jewels, to grace, pleasure, adorn, and inrich a Nation, who will not part with their Commodities, unlesse at very dear rates, or the full worth of them; But the Proposer intends not by many degrees to be so costly, to the receivers of the profit, which those whom he hath to deal withall will receive; for although not only the present profit, but likewise the perpetual good and benefit, which will arise, by a comparative rule of proportion, will be extraordinary great, yet the owner of these riches will expect from each particular person, that shall by vertue of a Licence, have the benefit of his Treasure, little more mony from first to last of his authority, than the Baggs, Cases, Chests, Vessels, or any o∣ther manner of outsides, wherein those rich commodities were inclosed and conteined, and then afterwards all people, are to have both outsides and in∣sides, and all rights and privilege to his Discoveries and Inventions, be they never so rich, and profitable, without any payment or acknowledgement, and so to continue to this and after ages for perpetuity. That no Justice of the peace or other Officer, shall be sued, or prejudiced,No Officers to be prejudiced for what they shall do in per∣suance of the said Acts. That the said Acts may be good and effe∣ctual, not∣withstanding any former Acts or Cu∣stomes. for what they shall doe, in persuance and execution of the said Acts. That the said Acts both for improvement of Land and Leather, may be good and effectual, in all Courts of Justice to the benefit of the said Thomas Ducket, Notwithstanding the Statute made in the first year of the reign of King James, touching the duty of Tanners, Curriers, Shooemakers, and other cutters of Leather; Or any imperfection in the said Acts; Or any former Act, Statute, matter, or thing, concerning either Lind or Leather, to the contrary in any wise Notwithstanding. The Breviats of the forementioned Bills, and some other matters inser∣ted in them, being set forth, the Proposer doth prepare these af∣ter answers to some objections that have, and may be made by Covetous, Malevolent persons. ANd first whereas it may be objected by some cross people,Several Ob∣jections an∣swered as to Land. that improvement of Land, will necessarily induce such a plenty of all things, as will cause a general cheapnesse, and abate the price of all commodities, and by conse∣quence diminish the Rent of Lands, and the revenues of Noblemen, and Gen∣tlemen, by disabling the Tenant to pay his rent (to this it may be answered.) That this Objection proceeds from a Root of private interest,  "Answer. and respects only the profits of particular persons, and those who are against improvements are Enemies to the Commonwealth where they live, for improvements do
not impoverish, but inrich a Commonwealth, for these following reasons; First although Land be improved, that it bear more Corn and Grasse than before, and that plenty thereupon causeth cheapness; yet the quantity being much more will make that good again and out-bear the cheapnesse;☞ that there needs no abatement of Rents, for Land will for the most part receive an im∣provement,N abatement of Rents by im∣provements. proportionable to the value and goodness that it is now of, as for example, if the improvement be to a third part of the value of the Land, then Land of two shillings an Acre will be improved to be as good as Land of three shillings an Acre; Land of twenty shillings an Acre to be as good as Land of thirty shillings an Acre, and so in proportion. Secondly, by improvement a lesse quantity of Land, will serve for Corn, and may be sowen with Hemp,More Land may be spared for several uses Flax, Cole-seed, Rape-seed, woad or madder, which will increase a manufacture, and produce an improvement, and mantainance for innumerable poor people. Thirdly, more Land may be laid down for Pasture, for maintaining milch Kine,More Land for Pasture then formerly. for plenty of Butter and Cheese, to relive the poor, and for transportation beyond the seas, and likewise to breed and mantain great Cattel for provisions for the Land, and Navy at sea, and for the encrease of that staple commodity of Leather; and also to breed and maintain sheep for the increase of that other Staple commodity of Wool, for the making of Cloaths and Stuffs, and other commodities; not only for the use of this Commonwealth, but for Transporta∣tion, and maintaining innumerable poor people on work. Fourthly, By improvement of Land, a far greater plenty of Corn, Cattel, and all sorts of provisions for Food and Rayment, A far greater ply will be raised. will be raised in this Common∣wealth, insomuch that it may be a Storehouse of plenty for perpetuity, and have so great an overplus of Food and Rayment, as that it may supply and help the wants of Forein Nations, and so bring vast summes of money, honour and profit to this Commonwealth, and yet have at home such a fulnesse of plenty, as that the Act for Transportation, made by a late Parliament, may rather be inlarged than abrogated, as now it is in part, several commodities exceeding the Rates in that Act limited and appointed. Answer. Rents rather increased than lessened.Lastly, no mans Incomes or Revenues will be lesse, by reason of the im∣provement, but rather bettered, for their cause of expence in such a plenty will be lessened, and they will have all manner of provisions and home-bred commo∣dities at very cheap rates. And if fertile bottomes are not better than barren mountains, and if the abun∣dance of the Fruits of the Earth, are not beside a blessing, a great support and establishment of the policy of a Nation, then why do the Lawes of England in∣dulge such privileges to arable Lands beyond Pasture? What mean the Sta∣tutes to restrain the converting of arable Lands into pasture grounds, to the hindrance of Tillage? Why are all Heath and other barren grounds exempt from the payment of Tythes, the first seven yeares after improvement, by a peculiar privilege? Besides, Improvements are very advantageous for hospitality, and relief of the poor,A general bene∣fit. in setting Old and Young, and all idle persons, to some slight work, who can endure no hard Labour, and so there will be no wandring poor as now, nor any to be relieved, but lame and blind persons, which will be very great honour and profit to this Common-wealth; for that Nation is most honoured, and re∣garded, by foreiners, wherein is the most fertility and ingenuity.
But if there be any who are not sensible of the blessing and advantage of plenty, questionlesse it were fit that such persons would confine themselves, for some years, to inhabit upon the tops of some barren Hills, or Mountains, to make tryal of such provisions, as Nature there affordeth,☜ without the help of improve∣ment, and there to learn by experience, the truth of these assertions, rather than to be convinced by the strength of argument in a plentifull Country, where perhaps the fullnesse of their stomacks may dull the acutenesse of their apprehensions. And for a further satisfaction of what hath been before expressed,Several Ob∣jctions answe∣red and Rea∣sons for Im∣provement of Leather. and now especially concerning that staple commodity of Leather. First, that all Leather made by the new Art, and Invention, of the said Thomas Ducket, will in all degrees of perfection, so far exceed all former Tan∣nage, that a great trade may be raised in this Common-wealth, by that Commo∣dity; for in what Nation soever, any new Art, or profitable Science,1. ☜ That Nation where this new Art is first dis∣covered will receive the greatest benefit. is first in∣vented and found out, that Nation will for many yeares after, have the sole trade, and benefit therof, and all Nations will addresse themselves thither, con∣ceiving there will be the best made, where it was first invented; and the chief parts of this new Art participating of rare Mysteries, and neat and private practi∣ces, yet are cheap and easy to be performed without the plain and common drudgery now used in Tannage, and may be so disposed of by the Proposor in this or other Nations, that during many score years, no other part of the world may re∣ceive any knowledge or benefit thereof.And may keep the said new Art a long time secret amongst themselves. Upon which grounds, how happy may this Nation be, in the speedy settle∣ment of these Mysteries and Inventions? for the said Science may be many years here kept amongst our selves, and Forein Nations induced to import their raw Hides and Skins, into this Common-wealth, to be converted into Leather after the said new Art; Or if we please, the said accomplishing ingredients may be sold,The Leather by reason of its goodnesse may be transported into other Na∣tions. and transported at very good rates, into other Countries, where they are not found; for Leather converted after the said new Art, will be of such lasting wear and goodnesse, that a third part thereof may be spared and sold beyond the seas, at double or treble the price that now it is, and yet here amongst our selves, it may be afforded at a more cheap and reasonable rate than now is sold at. And the ingredients, to prepare the said liquors,The new In∣gredients cheap and easie to be found. are most of them to be had within this Common-wealth, at cheaper rates, than the aforesaid old used in∣gredients, and will be of good benefit to the owners of the Grounds and Lands, where the said ingredients are found. Secondly, whereas Tanners are commonly a whole year,2. ☜ More speedy Tannage and a quicker re∣turn. three quarters of a year, half a year, and the like, in Tannage, according to the sizes of the Hides, and Skinns, they may hereafter by the use and practice of the inventers directi∣ons, make far better Leather, and in shorter time, whereby a quick return may be made thereof, which is the only advantage of a manufacture. Thirdly, although Bark of Oaks, and some other ingredients,3. Bark and the Ingredients now used are harsh and cor∣rosive. ☜ now principaly used in Tannage are very scarce, and costly; yet by their harsh corrosivenesse, they do very much perish and destroy the stability and fastnesse of all raw Hides and Skins, (which in themselves are some of the wonders of Nature in strength and tough∣nesse) and thereby Leather is much weakned of its natural force, and no remedy was ever known for the same before this present time. Fourthly, that Bark of Oakes, and other ingredients used by Tanners,4. The Trade of Tannage like to fail for want are of such high price and scarcity, that by means thereof, there is very much bad Leather made in in all parts of the three Nations, for want of full and perfect Tannage; And the said trade is like within few ages, to be neer extiuish'd by
Bark is like to be far more scarce, than now it is, if not in processe of time quite consumed. 5. Timber is fel∣led at unseaso∣nble times for the use of Bark.Fiftly, the necessity of the use of the aforesaid Bark is so great, that the Laws com∣pel the owners of timber to fell and cut down the same, at unseasonable times, when the sap is in it, which makes the timber so much worse in price and good∣nesse, as the rate of Bark doth amount unto, and their losse in the Bark, will in great Families be countervailed in the goodnesse, and lasting wear of the Leather made after the said new Art. The scarcity of Bark is the de∣struction of much young wood.Sixtly, that in this time of dearth, and scarcity of Bark, Tanners are so necessitous thereof, that by giving great prices for the same, they do thereby tempt, and procure the owners of groves and copses, to make sale of the same, when it is of very young growth, which if it were not to supply the Tanners in reference and and recompence of their high prices, the owners of many such groves and copses would permit and suffer the growth of them to continue, untill they came to be very good Timber, to serve either themselves or their posterity. 7. The sale of Bark may not be utterly ex∣tinguished, for several Rea∣sons.Seaventhly, the sale of Bark of Ash and some other ingredients, now in Com∣mon use, will not be utterly extinguished, for these reasons following; First, by the mixing and compounding the liquors and ingredients, now in Common use, with his new prepared liquors and ingredients, will take away the corrosive quality of the old, and make most exquisite Leather; Secondly, in some parts of the three Nations, the new ingredients may be scarce to be found, and the other ingredi∣ents very plentifull; And Thirdly, some English people are affected very much with the disposition of their neighbour Irish, and are altogether fond of old cust∣omes, being a thing, whereunto vulgar capacities are much addicted. A present ne∣cessity of settle∣ment for fear of future dis∣asters.Lastly, these designs of so great consequence, which are now in being, and are so freely tendred for the good of the Commonwealth, may in all likelyhood, by mortalitie, and other disasters (if not speedily embraced by the Supream Rulers) be as long hid from this Common-wealth, as it hath before wanted it, for none do know, but that after ages may be as long destitute of such an oppor∣tunitie, as former ages have been deficient of it. And now the Proposer hopes, having cleared all objections, with these satis∣fying reasons, that now he hath no opposite to answer, unlesse it be some particular persons concern'd in the sale of Bark, and the quick wearing out of ill Tann'd Leather, who respect their own private interest, more than the generall good of the Common-wealth, and such as those, he can divert and crosse by seve∣ral wayes, (if they should endeavour to hinder a settlement of the premisses) with this one assertion, that it lyeth in the power of the Proposer to discover and make known these his secrets in some industrious Forein Nation, who being thereby skilfully enabled in that master-piece of knowledge, will attract unto themselves so high a degree of perfection,A defeat to Co∣vetous and Malevolent Spirits. in the said Art and Mystery, as will highly advance a manufacture there, and so much diminish the progresse thereof in these parts, as will occasion Bark to sell at as low a rate, as if the Proposers directions, were here in frequent action: for all Leather made by the said new Art, will be of such lasting wear and goodnesse, that it will be most in request, and this Nation will altogether make use thereof, and be supplyed with the same, and so such malevolent persons may be defeated of their covetous in∣tentions, and this Nation attract losse, and disgrace for their incredulitie, and other contempts against flourishing plenty, and other Nations gain the honour and profit, whih ours, if not obvious to their own good, might have enjoyed by
Postscript. ANd whereas it is before apparent, that the Liquors, and Ingredients, now used in Tannage, are corrosive and destructive unto all sorts of Leather; So like∣wise your Honours may be pleased to take notice of the great losse and prejudice this Nation doth suffer, in the dying of those pretious Commodities of Silk and Wool into Blacks, which being in themselves some of Natures rarities, are notwithstanding ve∣ry much perished, and destroyed, for want of knowledge in Dyers, how to divert and qualify the inflaming and corrosive Natures of those Ingredients, which they use in dying black, which prejudice and inconvenience, the Proposer doth admire,The prejudie in dying of Blacks is es to be prevete and addresse that the Naturalists of former Ages could not prevent, it being a thing so easy and open to the Proposers skill and knowledge, although he doth not mention or promise perfor∣mance thereof in the aforesaid Bills, by reason if he should, now with the rest, tender his service in another so material a business, he should gain distast from the envious and unskilful in Natures Operations and Secrets, and should unjustly be very much clamoured and repined at by many, for directing how to uphold and continue the full strength and force of Wool and Silk in the dying, which would be great losse to the quickness of the Trade of Dyers, Silkmen, Drapers, Mercers, Taylors, and other Trades as to Silk and Wool: And although it is a business of small difficulty, for the Proposer to set forth a means of redresse, unto all Dyers, as well as Tanners, how to qualifie and divert the harsh and corrosive Natures of their now used Liquors and Ingredients, and to make all Silks and Woollen so dyed into black, to be as plump, soft, and strong for lasting wear, as any other artificial colour; As also to strike and permanently fix, those staining, fading, and decaying colours, both in Silk and Wool, which are dyed with Logwood, Brazil or the like, to continue in their fresh and lively Lustre, unto the uttermost wear thereof, and yet without the help of that costly ingredient called Cutchoneal; And although this last clause,Colours may be made more ilustrious, fix and perma∣nent. concerning fastning of colours in dying, be no great additional help to the Weal publique, yet it will be a per∣fect new Art of special good consequence, in point of Reason and Ingenuity, to the English people; But the spoyling of the aforesaid rich commodities, by dying them into Black, can be no other than a very unworthy practice, for that it is much losse to men, and questionlesse an offence to God, especially if it may be redressed; Yet England must lose this Master-piece, unlesse the Proposer be desired and encouraged thereunto, by the wise and prudent Magistrates of Parliament. And whereas the Hollanders have now some more honour and profit, beyond this or other Nations, in dying of Blacks, and preserving the strength thereof, yet is not their skill in that particular, of so great and high a degree of perfection, but their Art may be so much exceeded by the English, as will remove the glory and profit which they attract from other Nations, unto this our English Continent, if the Magistrates thereof, in respect of their own welfare, do desire to make use of the Industry of him, who truly honours all those that love the flourishing prosperity of their Native Country, beyond others, Thomas Ducket.
An Introduction to a Remarkeable Breviary in Verses which are drawn in allusion that this Nation may receive as much glory and wealthy preferment by the Industry and new Inventions of Thomas Ducket Esq as other fortunate Nations have gained by imbracing the Discoveries of persons famous in Knowledge and Action. To the Worthy Reader, I Having been a long time Servant to the Author of these ensuing Transacti∣ons, and Conversant in his Agitations, and now being imployed by him to attend the Impression conteining several rarities of Nature by him brought to perfection for the advance of this Nation, and many other fignificant adver∣tisements to the high Court of Parliament concerning the stttlement of a glorious national preferment in honor and wealthinesse, being Masterpieces of that emi∣nence as they deservedly merit the approbation of the Universe, called to mind a Poetical Berviarie of the said Mr. Duckets undertakings, done by a Person of worth, being Fellow of a College in Cambridge, who having had experience of the said Mr. Duckets abilities in many things as to Improvement of Land, and ha∣ving himself viewed, and had the Testimony of divers Tanners and other know∣ing Persons, that the Leather made by the said new Art, did far exceed all for∣mer Tannage, in this or other Nations, thereupon was pleased, upon the grain side of some of the said Skins, to give an Epitomy of the real perfection, and excellency of the said Mr. Duckets Art, and Ability to perform his undertakings for Improvement of Land and Leather; which for the Concise∣nesse of them, being composed in a few lines in verse, and so full of matter, that they could not be expressed in many sheets in prose, I therefore in reve∣rence of the gravity of the person and his verses, and the Truth therein contein∣ed, with their just allusions to honourable Atchievements, gainfull Inventions, and lively explanation of the Glory and Profit which might ensue to this Nation, could not contein my self, but assume the boldnesse, without their privity, to cause an impression of the said verses, which may well merit perusal and con∣sideration according to the humble conception of him who is A Faithfull Servant to the Author, And a Well-wisher to the Common-wealth. Richard Cookson.
To his worthily honoured Friend Thomas Ducket Esq upon his di∣ligent search into the Mysteries of Nature. Jason brought the stock of fine-woold sheep fi st into Spain. Virgl the Ro∣man taught Husbandry. The Chinois devised the making of Chi∣na dishes. De Serres brought into France the making of silk. Columbus inriched Spain by discovering to them the Gold and Sil∣ver Mines of India.WHat praise brave Jason got of old, By bringing home the Fleece of Gold; What Fame Heroick Virgil wan, By ayding of the Husbandman; What benefit the Chinois found, In the right use of Pursline ground; What great advance De Serres made, By teaching France the Silkworms trade; What wealth Columbus did impart, To Spain by his Sea-faring Art; What renown did ere accrue, To the Inventors of things new, That worthy Ducket is thy due: And if authority shall stand, Thy Friend in these designes, this Land May as great praise and prize obtein, As Greece, Room, China, France or Spain. Thy knowledge then let none cry down, The Author of these verses doth allude the renown that England may possesse by the Proposers Inge∣nuity, unto the good successe that Spain en∣joyeth by that sort of sheep, that were at the first brought thither by the industry of Jason; The which sheep were said to bear Fleeces of Gold, in re∣spect to the most exquisite finenesse there∣of, the Embleme of which Fleeces have been ever since worn as trophees of honour to the memory of Ia∣son upon the breasts of the most famous Monarchs of Christendome. And by that type or figure, it may as clear & properly be said that the English Cattel do bear golden hides & skins, for that Mr. Ducket by his transcend∣ent new Art hath atchieved unto the glory and honour of converting them ito the most exquisite Leather of the World in value and perfection. The Leather of the new make is very tough and strong, and will not rot by wet, nor wear out neer so soon as Leather of the old make. This or any o∣ther Nation that hath this skill may be inriched wher the Inventor doth communi∣cate his Scien∣ces.That by thy Golden Skins is shewn, Made Leather without Bark at all, Corrosive Shumack, Salt, or Gall, Or any Composition which Beyond Seas came to make it rich; But with Ingredients of our own, Whose influence was never known: Which Leather makes that glory wins, As if our Beasts had Golden Skins: Yet puts the Tanners Liquors down, That Leather makes so coarse and brown; Compar'd with thine, it is but drosse, An Embleme of the Worlds great losse. Which had continued but for thee, Throughout all times Eternity; Which now thy prudence can divert, When Honour shall advance thy Art: By turning Hides to Leather rare, In shew and glosse like Silken ware; Soft in the hand, white, plump, and full, Like felt well wrought of Beavers wool; In Colour, grain, in strength and touch, The Vniverse had never such;
Whose substance in the lasting wear, Doth exquisite, and firm appear; And that which makes the profits large, 'Tis done with little time and charge; Since in what Land thou dost derive, Thy Science needs in wealth must thrive: Yea to confirm how well 'tis Tann'd, None of the Trade denyes his hand; But labours for thy Patents grant, Lest we such good should longer want; And that by thy incouragement, We may enjoy whats eminent From others too who shall devise, Hereafter new discoveries. Besides in Husbandry thou dost, Supply with little pain and cost, Where Nature to defect declines, In Barren Lands, Fruit, Trees, and Vines; What former Authors did not reach, Thy pregnant Judgement now can teach; New Methods of perpetual gain, Nature by Natures to sustein: The drought of Land thou canst prevent, By Art and watery Element; Thou canst suppresse the force of weeds, That grasse doth Choak, and kills good seeds; With wealthy secrets thou canst fill, Those Nations shall imbrace thy skill; Thou hast recourse to Natures store, To fortunate both rich and poor With wealth of such a large degree, That all good men will pray for thee;The Author al∣ludes the In∣ventors know∣ledge in several mysteries to the Mine & Mint, in relation to his Theorical, Methodical, and practical parts, as also to his rich dis∣coveries that are of as great goodnesse as mines of Gold. Thy skill is such, that to conclude, With what rare gifts thou art indu'd, Few can conceive in the extent; And what makes all more excellent, All's thine, to silence barking tongues, That to the Mine and Mint belongs: So that his parts must be Divine, Who can in part but add to thine. Ieremiah Collier.
