THE BELGICK LYON DISCOVERD. 'TIs done! the Belgick Lyon, whose loud roar Fill'd all the Ocean from Shore to Shore With Noise and Vapour; is uncas'd, and now Discovers both his Ears, and Body too; Those Swoln Romantique Papers which have flown Abroad and fill'd each Part of Christendom With Lying Rumors, which proclaim'd what you Both had Design'd and were resolv'd to Do That durst with base unhallow'd Ink defile The Reputation of the Noblest Isle Great Neptune's Arms e're circled, nay blaspheme That Sacred Head which wears a Diadem Second to none in Europe, now appear Just Monuments both of your Shame and Fear True Pourtraits of your Baseness, Wretched Slaves Did you believe that your Batavian Braves Could fright the Brittish Monarch? Skellums, no! The greatest of your Force is much below His cheapest Thoughts; though all your Heere's wore Crown Rich as the Sun e're saw, though all your Towns Were Hogen-Mogen Empires, though your Souls Were keener then your Cheese, and your fat Joules Big as your Brandy, yet he'le give you knocks uch as will break the strongest Butter-box; Will melt you into your first Mass, and then You'le be the Poor distressed States agen; But you were got on Tip-toe th' Air of France d purg'd Phlegm, and taught you how to dance, These new Lavaltoes, dull-brain'd stupid Rogues. Worst then the worst of men, then Indian Jogues Could you forget what great ELIZA did When Aas Duke, Colossus like bestrid Your Jadish Backs, when th' Inquisition tore Your heart-strings out, and bath'd your sides in Core, When Sea and Land were both shut up, and you Neither knew where to stay, nor how to go, The English Valour then, (so much of late Despis'd by you) buoy'd up your sinking State, Rescu'd you from that Force, by which you were Thrown down into the bottom of Despaire, These then were favours, which to do you right You ever since have labour'd to requite Witness the Kindness, which by you was shewn To us at Banda, and at Pulleroon Amboina's Mercies too were great, and such As did to all men speak you truly DÆ²TCH, Know then you Fen-bred Frogs, the time is come Will give you a just Retribution The Mighty God, the God of Battels has Furbish'd that Sword which sav'd you then, to pass Thorough your Bowels now, that hand which he Advanc'd to break your Bonds and set you free He'le arm with Vengeance, and Vindictive Rage, To beat you into your first Vassallage.
