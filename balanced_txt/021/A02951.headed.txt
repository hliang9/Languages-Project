A Declaration of the cau∣ses that haue mooued the Cardinal of Bourbon, the Princes, Peeres, Gentlemen, Townes and Comminalties Catho∣like of this Realme of Fraunce, to oppose them∣selues to those which by all meanes do seeke to subuert the Catholike Re∣ligion and the Estate. IN the name of God Almightie King of Kings: Be it manifest to all men, that the Realme of France hauing bin troubled and afflicted these foure and twentie yeres, with a pestilent sedition mooued and stirred to subuert the auncient Religion of our forefathers, which is the strongest bande of the Estate, there haue bene remedies applied, the which contrary to the hope of their Maiesties, haue fallen out to be more apt to nourish the euill, then to quench the same, the which had nothyng of peace but the bare name, and haue not esta∣blished the quiet and weale of the Realme, but for their behoofe who troubled the same, leauing the honester sort offended in their consciences, and interessed in their goods. And in stead of remedie, the which in tyme was hoped and looked for against these mischiefs, such hath bene the will of God, that our kings of latter time haue deceased in their yong yeeres, without leauing any children able to succeede to
the crowne. And hitherto it hath not pleased him (to the great griefe of all good men) to graunt any issue to the king now raigning: although his sub∣iectes haue not omitted (neither hereafter at any time will cease) their most earnest prayers to ob∣taine that fauour of the goodnesse of God: In such sort, as remaining the last of so many children that God had giuen to the late King Henry, it is greatly to be feared (which God forbid) that this royall race through our euill happe, shall be quite extin∣guished without any hope of issue: And that in the establishing of a successour in the royall estate, there will fall out great troubles throughout all Christendome, and it may be the whole subuersion of the Catholique and Apostolike religion in this most Christian Realme, where an heretike shall neuer be suffered to beare rule, in so much as the subiects are not bound to acknowledge and suffer a Prince that is swarued and fallen from the Ca∣tholike faith: for that the first othe which our kings doe make when they are crowned, is to maintaine the Catholike, Apostolike, & Romaine Religion, vpō which othe they receiue that which their subiects doe make of fidelitie and allegiance, and not otherwise. Notwithstanding, sithence the death of my Lord the Kings brother, the purposes of those which by open profession haue shewed themselues alwayes persecuters of the Catholike Church, haue bene so bolstered and fauoured, that it is very needefull to thinke of some speedie and sound remedy, thereby to auoide the inconuenien∣ces most apparant, whereof the calamities are al∣ready knowne to all men, the remedy to fewe, and the way how to apply the same almost to no man.
And so much the rather, that a man may ea∣sily iudge by the great preparations and practises which they make to leuie souldiers as well within as without the realme, & the detainyng of townes and strong holdes, which long agoe they should haue restored and yeelded vp into the Kinges handes, that we are very neere the effect of their euill intentions, beyng very certaine that they haue of late sent to practise the Princes Prote∣stants of Germanie, that they might haue forces in a readinesse to suppresse at their pleasure all good men, as it is very apparant that they entend no∣thing els but to assure themselues, and sease of all necessary meanes to ouerthrow the Catholike re∣ligion, wherein euery man hath interest, and espe∣cially the noble men and great personages which haue the honour to hold the first and principall charges in this common wealth, whom they doe goe about to vndermine and ouerthrowe, during the kings life and vnder his authoritie, to the ende that leauing no man which hereafter may be able to oppose himselfe to their will, it may be more ea∣sie for them to bring to passe that change and al∣teration of the Catholike religion which they doe pretend, thereby to enrich themselues with the patrimonie of the Church, following the example which was begun to them in England, especially in that euery man doeth know sufficiently, and seeth (as it were) with open eyes the behauiour & acti∣ons of some, which being crept into the fauour of the King our Soueraigne Lord (whose Maiestie hath bene and alwayes shall be sacred & redoub∣ted vnto vs) they haue in a maner seased vpon his authoritie, to maintaine the greatnesse which they
haue vsurped, fauouring and aduauncing by all meanes the purposes of the aforesayd. And such hath bene their audacitie, to banish from about the King, not onely the Princes and the Nobilitie, but also those that are most neerest and deerest vnto him, giuing accesse to none but to such as depend vpon them. Wherein they are alreadie so farre foorth, that there is no man which hath any part or doing in the administration of the gouernement of the Estate, or that is suffered to exercise entirely his charge: Some are bereft of the title of their digni∣ties, other of the authoritie and execution of their offices, though they are suffered to enioy the vaine and fruiteles name. In like maner, the like hath bene done in the behalfe of diuers Gouernours of Prouinces, and Captaines of strong places, and to their Officers, who haue bene constrained to forgoe and yeelde vp their charges in respect of some recompence of money, which they haue receiued against their owne will and desire, because they durst not say nay vnto them which haue power to compell thē: A newe example, and neuer heretofore practised within this Realme, for some peece of money to take away the offices and charges from those to whom the same were giuen for recompence of their vertue and fidelitie. And by this meanes they are become masters, and haue possessed them selues of the forces of the Realme, as well by sea as by land, and doe goe about dayly to doe the like to others that are in office, so that there is no man can be assured, and that standeth not in feare, and looketh that his office shall be taken from him:
Howbeit the same hauing bene giuen him for de∣sert and seruice, hee ought not to bee depriued thereof by the auncient lawes of the Realme, vn∣lesse it be for some iust and reasonable considera∣tions, or that he hath committed some fault in the execution of his charge. In like maner they haue emptied the Kings Cofers of his treasure, where they cause the readie money of the generall re∣ceipts to be brought, and to be conuerted to their particular vse, and hold at their deuotion all the chiefe reuenues, the which are the very wayes to dispose of this Crowne, and to place the same on whose head they shall thinke good. Moreouer, through their couetousnesse it is come to passe, that abusing the gentlenesse of the Subiects, they haue enhanced by litle and litle to most grieuous exactions, not only matching those which the calamitie of warre had brought in (whereof in tyme of peace nothing was euer re∣mitted and abated) but other infinite oppressions growen from day to day, at the appetite of their vnbrideled wils. There was some hope, when through the of∣ten complaints and exclamations of the whole Realme, the conuocation of the generall Estates was published at Blois, which is the auncient re∣medy to heale these domesticall woundes, and as it were a conference betweene the Princes and their subiectes, to enter into a reckoning together of the due obedience of the one part, and due pre∣seruation of the other, which is the groundworke and foundation of the state of Fraunce: But of this troublesome and great assembly, there sprung nothing but the authorizing of the mischieuous
counsell of some, who fainyng themselues to bee good Politikes, shewed themselues in effect to bee euill affected to the seruice of God and of the weale publike, who were not contented to remoue the King (of his owne nature most enclined to godlinesse) from that holy and most holesome de∣termination, which at the most humble request of all the States he had made, to reunite all his sub∣iects to one Catholike, Apostolike, and Romane religion, to the ende that they might liue together in the auncient faith wherein the Realme was e∣stablished, and tooke encrease to become the most flourishing of all Christendome, which then might haue bene executed without any daunger, and in a maner without resistance. Notwithstanding, they to the contrary did perswade him, that it was ne∣cessary for his seruice to abate and diminish the authoritie of the Princes and Catholike Lordes, which with great zeale had oftentimes put their liues in hazard vnder his ensigne for the defence of the sayd Catholike religion, as though the re∣putation which they had gotten by their vertue & fidelitie, in stead of honour should bring them in suspition. So likewise the abuse which by litle and litle had taken hold and encrease, afterwardes is come vpon vs like a floud and downefall, with so violent a fall, that the poore Realme is euen at the point to be ouerwhelmed without any hope of helpe: For, the Ecclesiastical order, notwithstanding the declarations and petitions which they haue exhi∣bited, is at this day oppressed with tenthes and ex∣treme exactions, to the despising and contempt of holy orders, and of the Church of God, where∣in
now all things are polde and pilde: The Nobi∣litie is greatly aggrieued, driuen to pay exactions in despite of their priuiledge, if that they will bee contented to liue, that is to say, if they will either eate, drinke, or apparell themselues. The townes, Officers of the Crowne, and common people, shorne so neere by the daily paying of new imposi∣tions (which they doe terme inuention of Finan∣ces) that there remayneth nothing els, but to in∣uent some good way how to remedy this mischief. For these iust causes and considerations, Wee Charles Cardinall of Bourbon, the next Prince of blood to whome it belongeth especially to take in hande the safegarde and protection of the Catho∣licke religion in this Realme, and the cōseruation of the good and loyal seruants of his Maiestie and the Estate, being assisted with the Peeres, Cardi∣nals, Princes, Prelates, officers of the Crowne, go∣uernours of Prouinces, Noble men, Gentlemen, captaines of Cities, and others, which make the best & soundest part of this Realme, hauing wisely considered the cause mouing vs to vndertake this enterprise, and taken the aduise and counsell, as well of our good friends well affected to the weale and quiet of this Realme, as of learned and wise men and such as feare God, whome wee woulde not offnde heerein for all earthly treasure: Wee declare and make it knowen, that wee haue all sworne, and made a holy vowe to keepe our selues in armes, to the ende that the holy Church of GOD may bee restored to his for∣mer dignitie, and the true and Catholicke religi∣on established: that the Nobilitie may enioye (as they ought) their freedomes wholy and entirely:
and that the people may be released, the newe im∣positions abolished, and all exactions taken away, which haue bene made since the reigne of Charles the ninth, whome God absolue: That the Parlia∣ments may be restored to the fulnesse of their au∣thoritie, & entier soueraintie of Iudgement, euery one for his iurisdiction, and all the subiects of the Realme mainteyned in his gouernment, charge, and office, the which may not be taken from them but in such case as by law is established, and by or∣dinarie iudgemēt: that all such money as is leuied of the people, may be employed to the defence of the Realme, and to such purposes as is appointed: and that from hencefoorth the generall Estates may be assembled freely and without any practise, as oft as the state of the Realme shall require the same, with free libertie to euery man to exhibite their complaints, as they shall finde themselues agreeued. These things and others shall be more particu∣larly prouided for at the assembly of the Estates, which shall be held in armes for the reformation of the whole Realme, for the maintenance of the good Subiects and punishment of the euil, and for the suretie of our persons, who haue bene sought, and namely within these few dayes thorow secret conspiracies, should haue bene made away & vt∣terly ouerthrowen, as though the safetie of the E∣state did depend of the ruine of good men, and of those which so often haue ventured their liues for the preseruation of the same, hauing nothing left vnto vs more to warrant vs from hurt & to auoyde the sword which alreadie hangeth ouer our heads, but to haue recourse to those remedies which wee
haue alwayes abhorred. Whereto notwithstāding we woulde not haue trusted for the onely perill of our liues, if the subuersion of the Catholique Reli∣gion in this Realme had not bin vnseparably ioy∣ned withall: for the preseruation & maintenance wherof, we would neuer feare nor refuse any dan∣ger, making full reckoning that we cannot chuse a more honorable Tombe, then to die for so iust and holy a quarrell, both to discharge our selues of the duetie & bond which we owe (as good Christians) to the seruice of God, as also to auoide, as faithfull and good subiectes, the ouerthrowe of this Estate, which ordinarily doeth followe such alteration: Protesting that it is not against the King our So∣ueraigne Lord we doe take Armes, but for the defence of his person, his life, and his estate, for the which we doe sweare all of vs to expose and spend our goods and liues to the last drop of our bloud, with the like fidelitie that we haue shewed heretofore: And to lay downe our weapons so sone as it shall please his Maiestie to cause the perill to cease which doth threaten the ruine of the seruice of God and so many good men, the which we most humbly beseeche to procure with al speede, testify∣ing to euery man by good and true effects, that he is a most christian king, hauing the feare of God and the zeale of religion grauen in his soule, as al∣waies we haue perceiued, and that like a good fa∣ther and king he secketh the preseruation of his subiectes, in doing whereof his Maiestie shall be so much the more obeyed and honoured of vs, and of all his ancient subiectes, which we desire aboue all things in the world. And although that it be not a thing farre from
reason, that the king should be required to take or∣der, that during his life, the people committed to his charge should not be diuided into factions and partialities of the differēce of succession: Notwith∣stāding, so it is, that we are so litle mooued with any such consideration, that the slander of those which doe reproche it vnto vs, shall not be founde to be grounded vpon any foundation. For, besides that the lawes of the Realme are cleare inough in that behalfe, and sufficiently knowen, the hazard wher∣vnto we the Cardinall of Bourbon doe offer our selues in our olde daies and last yeeres, are proofe sufficient, that we are not set a worke with any such hope or desire, but that we are only mooued with a true zeale of religion, whereby we pretende part to another maner of kingdome more assured, the en∣ioying whereof is more to bee desired, and of lon∣ger continuance. Our intention being such, we doe beseeche all men, and most humbly the Queene mother of the king, our most redoubted Lady (without whose wis∣dom and good aduise this realme should haue bin piecemeale dispersed and quite destroyed) for the faithful witnes, that shee is able, wil, & ought to af∣forde to our great seruice, namely in particular to vs the Cardinal of Bourbon, who haue alwaies ho∣noured, aided, & assisted her, in her most vrgent af∣faires, without the sparing of our goods, liues, frēds and kinsfolks, together with her fortifying ye kings side, and vpholding the Catholike religion, that she wil not at this instāt leaue vs in the open field, but rather employ all the credite, which her paines & laborsome trauaile haue deserued of right, and of which credit with the king her sonne, her enemies
most vniustly seeke to bereaue her. Also we beseeche all the Princes of France, Of∣ficers appertaining to the king, Ecclesiasticall per∣sons, Noblemen, Gentlemen, & others of what de∣gree or calling so euer they be of, which are not as yet ioyned with vs, to helpe, aide and assist vs with their meanes & aduice in the execution of so good & holy a worke. And we doe exhort all townes and cōmunalties, euen as they do loue their owne pre∣seruation, to iudge soundly of our intentions, to ac∣knowledge the comfort which hereby shall come vnto ye estate, as well publikely, as to their particu∣lar, & to put to their helping hand to this good en∣terprise, which can not but prosper with the grace of God to whom we do referre all things: Or at the least, if their aduise & resolutiō cannot so soone a∣gree together (as their counsailes consist of diuers & sundry persons,) we do admonish thē to haue an eye to thēselues, & not to suffer any man to possesse thēselues by any sinister interpretation that they may surmise of our intentions, of their said towns, & so place in them garnison of souldiers, bringing them to the same slauery as the other townes be in which they do vsurpe. We do declare to al men that we do not meane to vse any acte of hostilitie, but against those who with armes shall offer to oppose thēselues vnto vs, and by other meanes shall fauour our aduersaries, which seeke the ouerthrowe of the Church, and to destroy the estate: Assuring euery man, that these our taking of armes being holy & iust, shal offer no oppressiō to any, be it in passing & abiding in any place, but shal liue with good gouernment, & take nothing but that which they shal pay for, & receiue
into their company al such as are zealous of ye ho∣nor of God, & of the holy church, & to the weale & preseruation of the most christian French nation: with protestation notwithstāding, not to leaue off their weapons till we see the full accomplishment and execution of the things aforesaide, and rather to die most willingly with a desire to be heaped vp together in one sepulchre consecrated to the latter Frenchmen dead in armes for the cause of God and of their Countrey. Last of all, for because all ayde commeth from God, we doe beseech all true Catholikes to ioyne with vs in this societie, reconciling themselues with his diuine Maiestie, by an entire reformation of their liues, thereby to appease his wrath, and to call vpon him in purenesse of conscience, as well by publike prayers and holy processions, as by priuate and particular deuotions: To the ende that all our actions may be referred to the honour and glory of him which is the God of armies, and of whom we doe looke for all our strength & most assured helpe. Giuen at Shalous the of March, 1585. Signed. Charles Cardinal of Bourbon.
A Declaration set forth by the Frenche kinge, she∣wing his pleasure concerning the new troubles in his Realme. Translated out of French into En∣glish by E. A. LONDON Imprinted by Iohn Wolfe dwelling in Di∣staffe lane néere the signe of the Castell. 1585.
A declaration of the French kinges plea∣sure, concerning the new trou∣bles of his Realme. NOtwithstandinge the king by letters & pre∣cepts hath heretofore sondry times admo∣nished hys Subiectes not to suffer them∣selues to be led away with the persuasions and counsails of some who seeke to practise and associate them vnto themselues, whereby to frustrate them of their quiet: and withall haue offered and promised fauor to such as being already entangled, shall vppon knowledge of his meaninge withdraw themselues: yet his Maiesty to his great grief vnderstanding that notwithstanding his saide preceptes and fauorable admonitions, some of his said subiectes vpon sondry considerations, (but for the most part being trāsported & blin∣ded with such faire and beautifull shewes as the authors doe set vpon their enterprises,) do stil enter into the same. His said Maiesty hath thought it requisite for the vniuersall weale of his said subiectes, the discharge of his cōscience toward God, & his reputation with the world to oppose against such artificiall deuise.  light
of trueth, which is the true comfort of the good and mortall enemy to their aduersaries, to the end his said subiectes beinge conducted by the light thereof may in time and without let dis∣cerne and know the originall & entent of such motions and so escew al both publike and pri∣uate calamities that may grow thereof. The pretenses which the autors of the said troubles do alleadge, are chiefly founded vpon The restoring of the Catholike, Apostolike & Romish religiō in this land: The distributing of the offices and dignities therof, to those vn∣to whom iustly they may appertaine: & The wealth, honor, and reliefe of the Clergy, No∣bility and Commons. These pointes al men haue manifestly kno∣wen to haue bene alwaies so déere and in such recommendation with his Maiesty that none can iustly doubt of his entent concerning the same: whereby it appeareth that they néeded not to haue practised his subiectes, gathered thē into armes, or leuied forein power wher∣with to induce him to accepte of such motions as they pretende to exhibite concerninge the same, in case they were iust, possible and com∣modious to his subiectes. In respect of the said religion, his said Ma∣iesty before his comminge to the crowne hath aduentured his owne life and with most hap∣py successe fought for the propagation of the
same: also since that it pleased God to cal him to the gouernement of this realme, he hath of∣tentimes to ye like purpose hazarded his estate, and imployed his best meanes, together with the liues and wealth of his good subiectes and seruants, whereby they may presently be per∣suaded and beleue that no man who so euer ei∣ther in this realme or els where, of whatsoe∣uer professiō hath more harty care of religion and godlines, then alwaies he hath had which by Gods grace he will still continue. Moreouer although after the example of the late king his brother with diuers other Chri∣stian Princes, whose Empires & dominions haue ben afflicted with sondry opinions of the said religion, his Maiesty by the prudent ad∣uise of the Quéene his Mother, my Lord the Cardinall of Bourbon, with other the Prin∣ces, Officers of the Crowne, and Lords of his Counsaile who then were about him, hath pa∣cified such troubles as were amonge his sub∣iectes by reason of the saide religion, vntill it might please God to revnite them into the bo∣some of the church: It doth not neuerthelesse therefore follow that his zeale and deuotion so farre as concerneth the glory of God and per∣fect restoration of the Catholike, Apostolike & Romish Church should bee any whit changed or diminished rather now then he shewed it to be during the said troubles: Yea so farre is he
there froe, that his Maiesty wisheth euery one to vnderstand that he concluded the said peace, purposedly to trye whether by the meanes therof he might revnite to the Church of God such his subiectes as the iniquity and libertye of the time may haue separated therefrom, as hauing so long founde euen with the daunger of his owne person and hazard of his estate, & price of the blood of so many Princes, Lordes, gentlemen, and other his subiectes, as haue died during the said troubles and by reason of the same, since the originall of the discorde for matter of religion, moued & rooted in the sayd realme during the minorities of the late kings his bretheren and his, to the great grief of the aforesaid Lady the Quéene their Mother, can¦not be determined by force of armes without the destruction of his subiectes and imminent daunger of his realme. A matter wherein hée was resolued vppon notice giuen him that all sortes of people were wearied and ouer toyled with the long course of the said troubles, as al¦so that he wanted meanes any longer to sup∣ply the charges of such warre: which shoulde not haue happened if in the assembly of the generall estates of this realme holden at Bloys the deputies there present had aswel prouided for a leuy of a stocke of quoyne wherewith to prosecute the said warre to the end, as was re∣quisite. and his Maiesty did require, as (being
induced through feruent zeale to the Catho∣like Religion) they could desire him vtterly to prohibite the exercise of the said Religion pre∣tended reformed, whereof did ensue the reso∣lution there taken and sworne vnto, which since his Maiesty did endeuour to put in exe∣cution: nether should they now haue any pre¦tence to complaine, no not they who neuer∣theles do publish abroad that euery man was sone depriued of that glistering beame of good hope which before by reason of the resolution taken in the said estates did shine vpon them: Besides that it is vnséemely and not lawfull for the subiect to iudge of his kinges actions, were it but in respecte that many times he is ignorant of the motiue causes of his comman∣dementes, which for the most parte are more pregnant then those that are apparant & ma∣nifest to all men: neither is it for any to doe but onely God, the searcher and cleanser of the harts and dealings of Princes, who knoweth the causes that did most enforce his said Ma∣iesty to the conclusion of the said peace: As be∣ing certaine that if he had any longer deferred the doing thereof, this realme had bene reple∣nished with forreine power and diuers par∣tialities and new diuisions which would haue bene very preiuditiall to the estate. His Maiesty did therefore graunt the sayde peace to the end to withstand all the aforesaide
inconueniences, to preuent the effectes therof and to try better remedies, and not as they al∣ledge) to ground or establish any heresie in the realme, for such a thoughte neuer entred into the hart of so Christian and good a Prince as his Maiesty is: who hauing foreséene, felte & found the difficulties aforesaid, haue thought it his duety the rather to harken to the said pa∣cification, to the end by meanes thereof to bée the better able to graunt to his subiectes the enioying of that reliefe whervpon they hoped in other the articles propounded and required at the assembly of estates aforesaid for the cō∣mon wealth of the said realme, peace & vnion being a fore-running and necessary meane to the establishing of good lawes and reforma∣tion of manners. Herevnto hath his Maiesty continually e∣uer since entended as is euident by the edictes and rules therevpon made, which he hath en∣deuored to put in effect and cause to bee obser∣ued: and although his entent hath not béene executed according to this desire, the same hath redounded to his greater grief, and hath hap∣pened peraduenture asmuch by the negligēce of some of his officers and sleightes of his euill willers as also by such footing and aduantage as impiety, corruption and disobedience haue set in this realme during the said warres. Through this peace, diuers townes reple∣nished
with Catholike Citizens & inhabitants are deliuered from the souldiers that had sea∣zed vpon them. The exercise of the Catholike, Apostolicall and Romane religion is renewed in the same, as likewise through his Maiesties diligence and care it is in most townes of this realme, yea euen in those wherein the profes∣sors of the saide religion pretended reformed, haue euer since the troubles beene and yet are the stronger, and from whence both before and euer since his comming to the Crowne, the said exercise hath beene banished. The face of iustice also hath thereby appea∣red though not altogether so fully and wholy as were to be wished, yet at the least in such e∣state as for the most part it hath shewed force sufficient to comfort the good and make the bad afraide. The Prelates & clergy are reentred in∣to their Churches & the enioying of their goods whereof they had béene spoiled. The Nobilitie and Gentlemen might liue safe in their houses and not be subiect to such expenses as in ye time of war they were forced to be at for preseruing them selues from being surprised. The Citizen depriued of his owne and wandring ouer the countrey with his familie is by meanes of the said peace reentred into his possessions. The Marchant likewise hath againe begunne his trade of trafficke which by the saide troubles was wholy interrupted. The poore husbandmā
groning vnder the weight of the supportable burden a rising of the vnbridled licence of the souldier hath meanes to breath & haue recourse to his ordinarie labor, for the sustentation of his poore life. To be briefe there is no estate or person but doth effectually participate in the benefits of the saide pacification. Moreouer as his Maiestie hath alwaies béene most ielous of the honor of God, & care∣full for the common wealth of his said subiects, as much as in a Prince most Christian & truly good, can, by acknowledging all euils and cala∣mities of any estate to arise principally throgh want and default of true godlinesse and iustice hath since the said peace continually labored to raise vp two pillers, which the violence of the saide troubles had almost subuerted and laide along. For the compassing whereof, he hath be∣gunne by naming méet & capable persons such as the holy decrees do appoint to ecclesiasticall promotions, hauing charge of soules. He hath also by his owne example inuited his subiects to reformation of their manners, and to haue recourse to the grace & mercy of God through prayer and austeritie of life, which haue con∣firmed the Catholikes in the duetie to his de∣uine Maiestie, and moued some of those that were seperated from Gods Church to reconsili∣ation to the same. He hath likewise entended greatly to giue
eare to the declaration and complaintes of the Clergie, giuing them libertie to assemble them selues to that effect, and hauing largely & fauo∣rably prouided for them, hath rather discharged then ouercharged them with extraordinarie tenthes, without respect to the necessitie of his owne affaires, notwithstanding whatsoeuer is published to the contrarie: and is sorie that hee can not likewise relieue them of the payment of their ordinarie, because he found them at his comming to the crowne morgaged for the pay∣ment of the rents of the towne of Paris. The said Prelates and Clergie haue also through his said Maiesties permission had o∣portunity to call & hold their prouincial Coun∣cels, whereby they haue consulted & prouided for the reformation of abuses brought into the Church during the saide troubles, & made good and holy rules to the welth of the same, which his saide Maiestie hath confirmed and authori∣zed. These are the fruites and common and generall commodities which Gods Church, & the Catholike, Apostoliike & Romish religion haue reaped of the said pacification, besides in∣finite other priuate & perticuler benefits which would be too long to rehearse. Concerning iustice euery man knoweth what paines his said Maiestie hath taken to withdraw the same out of darknesse wherein the troubles had plunged, to the end to restore
the light thereof to his former force and aunci∣ent brightnesse, hauing by death suppressed all superfluous offices, and withall prohibited and ceased the sale of the said offices which ye want of money had forced his predecessors to bring in, nothing regarding his owne neede, which is nothing inferiour to his predecessors. Besides all this his Maiestie hath excluded all remissions and euocations which aforetune were dispatched of his proper motion, in consi∣deration that he perceaueth how great hope to attaine the same did autorize euil deedes, and the small difficultie that was made in graun∣ting others did bring confusion into Iustice. Moreouer since the said pacification he hath had opportunitie to send into sundry prouinces of his realme, sundry chambers composed of officers of the parliament of Paris to minister iustice vnto his said subiectes euen in the saide place, whereof is growne such fruit as all men haue tasted, which yet would increase to the contentation of the good, if his good meaning had bene better assisted by those who naturally and by especiall bond of their vocations were bound thereto. But as the iniquitie of the time hath emboldened some to burden his Maiestie with other mens faultes, and that corruption & malice are so replenished with boldnes and im∣pudencie that many haue euen taken pleasure in defacing his most holy & best actions, wherby
to cause his subiectes to mislike of them and so to get to them selues their good wils with the expense of his reputation: yea so farre as some∣times to dare enterprete the most commenda∣ble zeale that he hath had to cause the decrees and sentences of the said chambers against euil doers to be executed, vnto ouer great rigor and seueritie. His said Maiestie had therfore begun by the meanes aforesaid to prouide for the erecting of these two true pillers, the onely foundations & preseruation of euery Monarchy and had con∣ceaued some assurance wholy to set them vp & restore them to their perfection through the cō∣tinuation of the peace if it had pleased God to haue giuen his grace to make his realme & sub∣iectes worthy therof. This also it séemeth those men which séeke to moue the subiects to take armes and yet vnder coulor of prouiding for both the one and the other, did as soone feare as foresée. They do also giue out that they take armes to the end to withstād the troubles which they say they feare should happē after his Maiesties decease in the establishing of a Royall successor to the disaduantage of the said Catholique, A∣postolique, and Romish religion. Being per∣swaded, or at the least so giuing forth that his said Maiestie, or they that are about him do fa∣uor the pretences of those yt haue shewed them∣selues
persecuters of the said religion. A matter whereof his Maiestie desireth and warneth his subiects to beléeue that hee neuer thought, as being, thanks be to God, in the flo∣wer and strength of his age and likewise the Queene his wife, and so hopeth that God will graunt them issue to the generall contentation of his good and loyal subiects: besides it séemeth to him that they séeke to force both nature and time and withall doe to much mistrust the fa∣uour and goodnes of God, the health and life of his Maiesty, and the faithfulnes of the said La∣die Quéene his wife in motioning at this time any such question, but much more in prosecu∣ting the decision therof by force of armes. For in liew of warranting and deliuering y• realme for the mischiefe which they say they feare will one day ensue hereof, the entry into warre pre∣sently for that cause is properly as much as to hasten the griefes of the same: as being assured shortly to replenish the realme with forraine power, partialities, and innumerable discords, besides bloud, murther and infinite robberies & oppressions. Here may you sée how the Catholike religiō shall be restored, the Clergie discharged of their tenthes, the Gentlemen liue quietly and safe in his house and enioy his rightes & prerogatiues, ye Citizens inhabitants of townes exempt frō garrisons, and the poore townes eased of subsi∣dies
and impositions that it now beareth. His maiestie therefore warneth and exhor∣teth his subiectes in this case to look about them and not to perswade themselues that this war can be finished so soone and easily as is giuē out, but rather to weigh and déepely to consider the euent and ineuitable consequence thereof: and not to suffer their reputations to be stained, & their weapons to seeme as an instrument to ye destruction of their countrie and to the increase of the power of the enimies fherof, who onely wil triumph and reape benefite by the miseries & calamities of the same. For while we, blinded in our own benefit shall warre one vpon ano∣ther and be succoured in outward appearance, but in effect fed on by their assistaunce, they shall raigne prosperously and establish their power. They complaine also of the diuision of ye of∣fices and houses of this said realme, saying that such are put from them as haue better deserued of the estate and his Maiesties seruice. A weak foundation and of no great honor to build the ruine and saluation of so florishing a realme whose kings were neuer bound to vse the ser∣uice of one more then of an other. For there is no law that bindeth him therto except as the benefite of his seruice requireth. Neuerthelesse his said Maiestie hath at all times greatly ho∣nored and cherished the princes of his bloud, as
much as any of his predecessors, and hath she∣wē a will to preferre others into credit, honor and reputation by vsing their seruice: for so oft as his said Maiestie hath leuied any power or army, he hath stil by preferring them commit¦ted the charge and cōduct of the same vnto thē, and if we do cōsider who at this present haue the greatest and most honorable roomes in the realme, we shal find that they ar said to be the authors of such cōplaints & haue cause rather to commend his maiesties goodnesse and fauor then any way to complaine & depart frō him. But say they, they haue but the name, and in effecte are depriued of the prerogatiues de∣pending vpon their saide offices, which other men do vsurpe. Before we iudge of the merite of such complainant it were good to sée & déepe¦ly to looke into the rightes and preheminences to euery office attributed, and then to consider how and by whome they haue bene admini∣stred in the time of the kinges predecessors. A matter which his Maiesty hath often pro¦pounded, when he hath endeuored to set order in euery mans office, and had long since bene determined and decided if those that haue in∣terest therein had accordinge to their dueties aided and assisted him as they ought. But shal it therefore be now saide and so left to the po∣sterity that priuate interests and discontenta∣tions should be the cause of troubling a whole
estate, and replenishing the same with bloud and desolation? This is not the way that should bee taken in séeking to redresse those abuses which they complaine of, sith they haue to do with so mer∣cifull a Prince, who still would preuente the inconuenience, and willingly would accept of all méete and cōuenient remedies which may be offered to him for the redresse of the same. Let therfore the weapons be laide downe, forrein power countermanded & this Realme deliuered out of that daunger which now it is like to incur by this rising & taking of armes, and in lieu of proceeding in this way which is full of stumblinge blockes, miseries and both priuate and publike calamities, let the path of reason duely be sought out, vndertaken & fol∣lowed, whereby Gods holy Church, the ene∣my of all violence may more easily be restored to her power and beauty, and the Nobility sa∣tisfyed and contented as it ought to be. For which of the kings his Maiesties predecessors haue in effect shewed any token of more loue or cherishing ye order thereof then his Maiesty hath done? as not being contented with pre∣ferring it before the aunciente and principall honors and degrées of this realme, but hath expresly erected and made others new, which he hath consecrated to the illustration of true nobility, as hauing excluded and depriued all
other estates from the same. His Maiesty will also effectually prouide with al speede for the ease of his people, like as he hath already very well begon, and wisheth to his power to continue. Moreouer notwithstanding the Captaines of this warre do promise that their power and forces shall liue so orderlye that all men shall like thereof, and withall that they exhorte the cities and towns not to admit any garrisons, yet doe wee sée that the souldiours when they haue gathered together do already commit in∣finite oppressions and excesse, also that they haue placed forces in those townes and holdes which they haue seised vpon, to the end to rule and keepe them in their obedience. Besides al this it is euident that many vagabonds & idle persons will as hath bene accustomed rise vn∣der the name & coulor of either part who will commit infinite sacrileges and mischiefes. In such sort that in lieu of stopping the daunger which threatneth the destruction of Gods ser∣uice and all good men as by this warre they do promise, it will replenish the whole realme withall impiety and vngodlines. They doe also geue out that their liues are in daunger, and that that is one of the causes that moueth them to rise, No man can thinke that this complaint any whit concerneth hys Maiesty, aswell in respecte of the good and fa∣uorable
vsage that at all times they haue re∣ceiued at his hāds, as also in that his said Ma∣iesty is naturally so farre frō all sort of reueng that the person is yet vnborne, that can iustly complaine of him for the same, notwithstan∣ding whatsoeuer offence against him commit∣ted, wheras contrarywise there are many that hauing proued his clemency may serue for a perpetuall remembrance to the posterity. In consideration her of his said Maiesty de∣sireth and exhorteth the Captaines of the sayd risings spéedely to disperse their bandes, coun∣termaund the straungers, and depart from al factions, and as his kinsmen and seruants, to repose assured confidence in his loue and good will, which in so doing he offereth to continue vnto them, by honoring them with his fauour and making thē partakers of such honours as he is accustomed to bestow vpon men of theyr calling: to ioyne and revnite themselues vnto him, to the ende duely and effectually to pro∣uide for the restoring of Gods seruice, and the common wealth of his said subiectes in suche order as shal be thought méete and cōuenient, whereto his Maiesty is willing to herken. He also warneth all Ecclesiasticall persons and gentlemen his subiectes wel to weigh the consequence of these stirres, sincerely to em∣brace his entent, and to beleue that his minde alwayes hath and still shall tend to do good to
all, and harme and displeasure to none. He doth therfore most straightly command them and all other his subiectes to depart and withdraw themselues from all leagues & asso∣tiations, and to revnite themselues vnto him, as nature, duety, and their owne wealth and health doth bind them, to the ende that if these commotions do procede any farther (which he beseecheth the goodnesse of allmighty God not to permit) he may haue assistaunce and succor in their counsaile, weapons and commodities to the preseruation of the Realme, wherevnto is linked the Catholike Apostolike & Romish Church therein, their honor, reputation, per∣sons, famelies, and goods. Offering and promisinge vnto them in so doing the continuance of his fauor with recō∣pence for their fidelity and seruice. And vnderneath Giuen at Paris in the moneth of Aprill 1585.
