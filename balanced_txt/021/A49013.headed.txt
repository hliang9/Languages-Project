An ACT of Common Council for Regulating the Company of PLAISTEERERS, London. WHEREAS the Master and Wardens of the Guild or Fraternity of the Blessed MARY of PLAISTERERS, London, are, and very anciently have been a Brotherhood or Guild, and for confir∣mation and strengthning of Their Priviledges have obtained several ROYAL GRANTS, whereby, and by their Original Constitution, the said Fraternity or Guild ought to be and consist of all Persons using
the Trade of a 'PLAISTERER, within the City of LONDON and Liberties thereof. Nevertheless many Persons, who use and exercise the Trade of a PLAISTERER, have Obtained their Freedoms of other Companies by Patrimony, Re∣demption, and otherwise, to the great Prejudice and Hindrance of the said Company of PLAISTERERS: By reason whereof many and great Frauds and De∣ceits have been used, practised and imposed upon the Citizens of this City, and other Their Majesties good Subjects, for want of due Government of the Artificers exercising the said Trade, and for lack of frequent and due Inspection and Search of and in the Plaisterers Work, which is wrought and done by them who are not Members of the said Fraternity or Guild, and so not subject to the good Government of the said Com∣pany, and to the good and wholsom Laws and Ordi∣nances thereof; and thereby also the said Company of Plaisterers is of late years much lessened, decayed and diminished, and in a short time will become Vncapable of supporting themselves, and preserving the Iust and Honest use and exercise of the said Trade. For Remedy and Reformation whereof, and to the intent the aforesaid Mischiefs may be prevented in time to come, and to the end the said Company may here∣after have the better and more easie and powerful View, Search and Oversight of all Matters material, and Things pertaining and used in the said Trade, and to the Faithful, Honest and Iust Workmanship thereof, and for the more effectual punishing all Frauds, Deceits, Vnskilful Workmanship; and other Offences in the said Art and Trade done and committed: Be it Enacted, Established and Ordained by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen his Brethren, and Commons in this Common-Council Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from henceforth all and every person or persons, hereafter Using or Exercising the said Trade of a PLAISTERER, within the said City and Liberties thereof, who hath or shall have Right or Priviledge to be made Free of this City by Patrimony, Service,
Redemption, or otherwise, by virtue of his Father's Freedom in any other Company, whereof his Father was, is or shall be Free, or by Service with any Free∣man of any other Company, shall (at the next Court of Assistants of the said Company of PLAISTERERS, after Notice thereof to him given, by the Clerk or Beadle of the said Company, by Order of the Master and Wardens of the said Company for the Time being) accept and take upon himself the Freedom, and be made a Free-man of the said Company of Plaisterers, in like manner and form as he could or might have been in any other Company whereof his Father or Master was so Free, as aforesaid; Any Law, Custom or Vsage to the contrary notwithstanding. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons, using or exercising, or which shall use or exercise the Trade of a PLAIS∣TERER, within the City of London, or Liberties thereof, who hath already served an Apprenticeship, or shall hereafter serve an Apprenticeship in the said Trade, and not yet made Free of this City; or who shall pro∣cure his Freedom by Redemption, Service or Patri∣mony of any other Company, than of the said Com∣pany of PLAISTERERS, and shall exercise the said Trade within the said City of London or the Liberties thereof, not being Free of the said Company of Plai∣sterers; Then all and every such Person and Persons so doing and offending in all, either, or any the said Cases, shall forfeit and pay for every such Offence, the Sum of Ten Pounds of Lawful Money of England, to be Recovered by Action of Debt, Bill or Plaint; to be Commenced and Prosecuted in the Name of the Chamberlain of the said City of London, for the time being, in Their Majesties Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen, to be holden in the Chamber of the Guild-Hall of the said City of LONDON; And that the Chamberlain of the said City for the Time being, in all such Suits to be Prosecuted by virtue of this present Act against any such Offenders, shall Recover his ordi∣nary Costs of Suit, to be Expended in and about the Prosecuting the same.
And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That one Moiety of all such Forfeitures, to be recovered by Virtue of this present ACT (the Costs of Suit for recovery of the same being first deducted and al∣lowed) after recovery and receipt thereof, shall be from time to time paid to the Chamberlain of the said City, to the use of the Mayor, Comminalty and Citizens of the said City of London; and the other Moiety to the Master, Wardens and Assistants of the said Company of Plaisterers for the time being, for the Vse of the Poor of the said Company. And that in case the Chamberlain for the Time being, shall be Nonsuited; or any Verdict or Iudgment be given for the Defendant or Defendants, in any such Action to be brought by virtue of this ACT, That then the Costs of such Nonsuit, Verdict or Judgment, shall be paid and born by the Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Company of PLAISTERERS for the Time being; and the said Chamberlain to be fully indempnified and saved harmless, by the said Master, Wardens and Assistants, of and from the same: Any Law, Custom or Vsage to the contrary thereof not∣withstanding. And be it further Enacted by the Authority afore∣said, That no Person or Persons, Vsing or Exercising the said Trade of a PLAISTERER within this City or the Liberties thereof, shall be from henceforth Admitted by the Chamberlain of this City for the time being, into the Freedom or Liberties thereof, in any other Company, than the said Company of PLAISTERERS; Any Law or Custom of this City to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.
