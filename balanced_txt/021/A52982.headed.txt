A NEW SONG, BEING THE TORIES Imploration FOR Protection against the VVhiggs. To an Excellent New Scotch Tune. I. DEfend us from all Popish Plots, That so the People fray; And eke from treacherous Whiggs and Scots, As bad or worse than They. From Parliaments, Long Rumps, and Tails, From House of Commons Furies; Defend us eke from Protestant Flails, And Ignoramus Juries! II. Protect us now and evermore, From a White Sheet and Proctor, And from that Noble Peer, brought o're The Salamanca Doctor: A Doctor with a Witness, sure, Both in his Rise and Fall; His Exit almost as obscure, As his Original! III. Designs and Dangers far remove From this Distressed Nation, And Damn the Trayterous Medal off, Bold Tony's 'Sociation. And may the Prick-ear'd Party, that Have Coine enough in Cupboard, Forbear to shiver an Estate, And Splinters mount for Hobbart! IV. From sixteen Self-conceited Peers, Protect our Soveraign still; And from the Damn'd Petitioners For the Exclusive Bill. Our King Defend, and make Him great, 'Gainst Tony upon Tony; And from a House of Commons, that Will give the King no Money! V. From those that did Design and Laugh At Tangier, in Distress, And were Mahometans worse by half, Than all the Moors of Fez From such as with Usurping Hand, Drive Princes to Extreams; Confound all their Devices, and Deliver Charles and James! VI. May they be Wise, and soon expel Th' Old Fox, th' Old Fawning Elf; The Time draws nigh, Achitophel Slnn't need to Hang himself. Impartial Juries for his sake, Brave North and Box may bring; And make his Nose thro' Nooze to sneak For Treason 'gainst his King. London, Printed for W. D. in the Year 1682.
