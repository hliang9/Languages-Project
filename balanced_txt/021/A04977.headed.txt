AN HELPE FOR yong people, Preparing them for the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper. By W. L. B. D. LONDN, Printed by T. H. for Nathaniel Butter at the Pyde Bull, neer St. Augustines Gate. 1640.
Directions for the weak and ignorant Reader. YOu first directed and taught me, how to teach you; I learned from you, not from my Bookes, what questions to instruct you in, by observing your misconceits of the first & necessary grounds of faith, and accordingly I have framed this short Catechisme: Many other points are needfull for you, as to understand the Creed, because else you cannot beleeve it: and the ten Commandements, els you can∣not know your sinnes, nor your duties: and also the Lords Prayer, els you cannot tell
how to pray: But for help heerein, I referre you to some short Catechisme, where these Heads are expounded. Now that you may profit by this take these directions: 1. Learn by heart the places of Scripture brought for proofes, and ponder them in thy mind, till thou understandest how they proove the point for which they are alledged. This will help thy understanding; for it is not e∣nough to say the words, unlesse thou under∣stand the matter. 2. Observe by the order of the parts, how and in what order God doth save men by Christ and be you sure to goe that way. 3. Observe that the Cove∣nnt of Life and Peace in Christ, and justi∣fication by faith do goe before the use of the Sacrament, as the Grant or conveyance of Land, doth before the sealing: and therfore you must first be in covenant with God, ere you can have right to, or benefit by the Sa∣crament 4. For the great duty of exami∣ning your selves, doe thus: Lay the signe of triall before thee, and then aske thy con∣science, Is it thus and thus with my soule? For example for triall of thy faith and re∣pentance, put thy selfe to the question: How
long have I had faith? Have I indeed been wrought upon by the word of God? What change do I finde in my selfe since I was a beleever? Spread all thy sinnes before thee, and then demand, Soul how do I like of this or that sin? Do I make conscience of it? or am I willing to enjoy it longer? to make excuses, and find pretences for the practi∣sing of it? So for obedience and charity, examine thy selfe thus; Do I desire and en∣devour to know, and doe Gods will in all things? Or am I willing to hide mine cies from this or that daty, and to shift it off? Do I love the godly because they be godly? Or can I scone, mock, and despite them? Deale faithfully with thy poore soule in this duty of examination and triall remembring that before the act of receiving, thou doest confesse thy sinnes, and professe before God and that Congregation, that the remem∣brance of them is grievous unto thee, and the burden intolerable: doe not now dis∣semble with God and men: be sure of this, that if thou bring not grace, the Sacrament will put none into thee. He that comes a Iuaas, shall go a Iudas: he that comes an
unbeleever, or ignorant, or impenitent, shall goe away so as he came, may in worse case then he came. 5. And lastly, Labour for distinct knowledge in matters of salvation, content not thy selfe with ungreauded con∣jectures, as I thinke so, and I hope so. Build not on the sand, but be thou an hearer and a doer of the word, so shalt thou be able to day hold on eternall life. Amen.
An help for yong People preparing for the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper. Of Christ, and how he seveth us. Q. HOW doe you hope to be saved? A. By Iesus Christ. Q. Who is Iesus Christ? A. The second person in the blessed Trinity, who in the fulnesse of Time took our nature and became man for our Re∣demption: Gal. 4.4. Ro. 1.3.4. Ioh. 1.14. Mat. 16.16. Ioh. 6.69. Q. What hath he done to save you? A. He died to save me from my sins Ro. 4. 25.1. Cor. 15.3. Es. 53.5. Col. 1.20. Q. Must you else have died and suffred Gods wrath? A. Yes; for death is the wages of sin, and all that are sinners be under the Curse. Gal. 3.10. Ro 6.23. Q. How can the death of another save you?
A. Yes, Because Christ is our suertie, ap∣pointed of God to beare our sins, and there∣fore what he did and suffered in our Name, it is as well as if we had done it our selves. Heb. 7.22. Es. 42.6. Es. 53.6. Gal. 3.1.3. Gal. 4.4.5. 2. Cor. 5.21. 1 Pet. 2.24 Q. Gods justice then must be satisfied for every sin? A. Yes: God punisheth the sins of the Elect in the person o Christ, But the sins of others that do not believe in their own per∣sons. Ioh. 16.9. Ioh. 11.50. Ioh. 8.24. Q. How doth Christ satifie Gods Iustice for us? A. Because he answered the law for us: Gal. 4.4, 5 Ro. 10.3. Q. How did he answer the law for u A. By bearing the punishment which the law threatned for sin, and fulfiling the obe∣dience which the law required of us. Ro 5.19 Gal. 3.13 Ro. 5.9. Q. How commeth the death of Christ to be so available? A. Because it was the suffering and obedi∣ence of him that is God: Act. 20.28. 1. Pet. 19.1. Cor. 2.8.
Of our need of Christ. Q. DO you stand in need of Christs right∣eousnesse to save you? A. Yes: Because I and all the world are wholly corrupted with sin through Adams fall, and to become slaves of Satan and guilty of eternall damnation R 3.10. Gen. 6.5. Ro. 5.12.19. Eph. 22 Ro. 10.3. Q. What is sin? A. It is any breaking or swerving from the law of God. 1.10.3.4. Q. How came sin into the world? A. By the first sin of Adam and Eve in eating the forbidden fruit [God made man upright] Gen. 3.6. Ro. 5.12. Q. Are you then a sinner? A. Yes: I was borne in sin: and do daily Break Gods holy laws, being very prone to evil, and untoward to any thing that is good: Ps 51.5. Ro. 7.23. Q. What is the punishment due to sinne and sinners? A. The wrath of God, and eternall death in Hell fire. Q. You are delivered from sin & the pu∣nishment the of only by Christ, as you said?
A. Yes, for his blood clenseth us from all sin, 1. Ioh. 1.7. Heb. 9.26. Q. How can that be, seeing you confesse that you are still a sinner? A. Yes, though sin remaine in me, yet I am clensed from all sin for two reasons. Q. What the first? A. Because I am made free from the pu∣nishment of sin (i) from damnation, being justified by the blood of Christ: Ro. 8.1. Ro. 5.1. Ro. 10.4. Ro. 4.7. Q. Why secondly? A. Because by Christ, we are made free from the power of sin, so that sinne doth not reigne in us: 2. Co. 5.17.20. Gal. 2.17. Ro. 6.6, 114.1. Ioh. 3, 8. Ro. 8.2. Of the means to pertake of Christs righteousnesse. Q. ARe all men thus clensed and saved by Christs death? A. No: only they that truly beleeve and re∣pent of the evill of their doings: Es. 1.16. Luke 13.3. Marke 4.17. Luke 24.47. Q. What is faith? A. It is a beleife of the Gospell, whereby a sinner truly humbled for sin, doth trust and test upon Christ alone for salvation. Or thus;
Faith is the relying of an humbled soule upon the promises of God for salvation by Iesus Christ: Eph. 1.13. Es. 50.10. Q. Must the soule be first humbled and pricked for sin before it can go to Christ for salvation? A. Yes: for Christ came to call sinners, and to heals the Broken hearted. Mat. 9.13. Es. 61.1. Luk. 4.18. 1. Tim. 1.15. Q. What promises hath God made to the humbled soule that believeth and resteth on Christ for mercie? A. God hath said, they shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Ioh. 3.16. Mat. 11.28. Q. Is it enough to beleeve and no more? A. No, we must also repent, and be con∣verted and turne from our fins: Act. 3.19. Mat. 3.8.10. Mar. 1.15.20.21. Q. What is repentance? A. It is, an earnest displeasure and hatred against sin, whereby we turne from sin to walk with God in newnesle of life: Mat. 3.8, 10.2. Cor. 7.10.11. Q. What promise is there made to them that truly repent? A. God will pardon their sins and remem∣ber them no more. Es. 55.7. Es. 1.18. Heb. 10.17. Luke 15.7, 20. Q. Can we not be Iustified before God by
our works of obedience, & good endeavors? A. No, because in many things we faile all: and he that is a breaker of the law cannot be saved by it. Ro. 3.20 Ro 4.5. Iam. 3.2. Q. What is the true difference between the Doctrine of the law, and of the Gospell touching salvation? A. The law offreth salvation to them a∣lone, that do fulfil and keep it perfectly in their own persons R. 0.5. Q. How doth the Gospell offr us salva∣tion? A. By the righteousnesse of another, (i.) of Christ, apprehended and applyed to the humbled Soule by a lively faith: Ro 10 9.11. Ro. 4 6.13. Q. Is true faith then void of good works, and of holinesse of life? A No: for then it were a dead faith, and it could not profit us, because whosoever is in Christ is a new creature: Iam 2.14. 2. Cor. 5.17. Iohn 15.2. Q. What is the meaning then when you say we are justified by faith without works? A. The meaning is, that we are justified by Christs righteousnesse onely, and that there is no need of our works to be joyned with him in that busines Rom. 3.21.24.28. Q. It seemes then that God doth receive us into his favour out of his meere mercy in
Christ alone, Imputing his righteousnesse un∣to us, and not our sinnes? A. It is most true: 2. Cor. 5.21. Rom. 4.5.6. Q. The covenant also of life and peace is made in Christ, to them that believe and re∣pent without the condition of perfect obe∣dience? A. It is so. Rom. 5.6. Gal. 2.17.1. Ioh. 2.2. Q. This blessed doctrine is taught us in the Gospell, how else is it taught and confirmed to us? A. In the Sacraments. Of the nature and use of the Sacrament, and of our preparation thereunto. Q. HOw many Sacraments be there? A. Two only: Baptisme and the supper of the Lord: Q. What is a Sacrament? A. It is a Seal of the righteousnesse of faith: or a token of the Covenant of peace between God and man. Ro. 4.11. Gen. 17.11. Q. Say the same in other words? A. A Sacrament is an outward and visible signe of an inward and spirituall Grace given unto us: as in your Catechisme: Q. What is that spirituall Grace, whereof
the Sacraments be outward signes and pledges? A. The favour of God doing away our sins in and by Christ Crucified: 1. Cor. 10.16. 1. Cor. 11.26. Heb. 9.26. Q. How many parts be there of every Sacrament? A. Two: first some outward bodily sign of Christs own ordaining: secondly and some spiritual Grace or Benefit thereby signified: Q. What is the outward sign in the Lords supper? A. Bread and wine given and received according to Christs appointment. Q. What is signified thereby? A. The body and blood of Christ Crucifi∣ed for our sins. Q. What is the benefit of receiving these signes? A. By them, as by a token and pledge from God himselfe, the worthy receives is assu∣red that be hath a part and share in Christs Death, and shall be saved thereby. Q. Do all that come to the Lords Table receive such a pledge of Gods favour? A. No: only they that be worthy recei∣vers: [the rest receive meet bread and wine, and so profane Gods ordinance, and provoke Gods judgements against them∣selves.]
Q. What must we doe that we may be worthy receivers? A. We must examine our selves whether we have first Faith. Secondly, Repentance. Thirdly, New obedience. Fourthly Charity. [For the ignorant and unbeleevers, the Im∣penitent, disobedient and uncharitable per∣sons, be all of them unworthy receivers.] Q. What Faith is required in a worthy Communicant? A. The profession of the true Faith, and the Grace of faith. Q. Why is the profession of Faith re∣quired? A. Because He that looks to partake of Christian Priviledges, must know and maintaine the Articles of Christian religion. Q. Where be the Articles of the Christi∣an Faith contained? A. In the word of God, and more sum∣marily in the Creed. Q. Do you understand the Creed? A. Yes. Q. Why is the understanding of those Articles of faith required? A. Because if we doe not understand the meaning of them, we can never believe them. Q. Many understand the Creed and yet
are unworthy receivers: How may one be assured that his knowledge is Sound and Saving? A. By two signes of saving knowledge. Q. What is the first? A. It is a Renuing knowledge, it doth not onely acquainte me with Gods will and waies, But also it worketh my heart to Obe∣dience of the same. Luk. 7.47. Ioh. 13.17. Ro. 2.20. Ro. 6.17.2. Cor. 3.18.2. Tim. 3.5. Q. Whats the second signe of saving knowledge? A. It is an humbling knowledge, which maketh me more and more to see how vile I am, and how unable to doe any thing that is good, and so to seek strength & helpe from Christ. Phil. 3.7.8. Ro. 7.9. Iob 42.6. Q. You have said, that faith is the rely∣ing and resting of the humbled soule upon Christ alone for salvation, How will you trie your faith whether it be sound and lively? A. By two signes. Q. Whats the first? A. If it hath been wrought in my heart by hearing and knowledge of the word of God. Ro. 10.4.17. [for if we have alwaies had this faith, as carnall persons say they have had, it is a Counterfeite faith: for na∣turally we are borne in unbeliefe, Neither
doth faith grow up with our Education, But it is a supernaturall gift of Gods spirit, wrought in us by the Gospell Eph. 2.8. Ro. 2.27. Gal. 5 6. Ro. 9.8. Ioh. 3.6. Q. Whats a second signe of true faith, whereby it may be knowne? A. By the fruite of Faith which is to make me walke by the rule of faith (i.) the scrip∣ture, so that I shall not believe one thing and do the Contrary: [True faith will make one to practise what he believeth: else tis a dead faith.] am. 2.16.17. Act. 15 9. Q. Why is this Gracy of faith required in a receiver? A. Because by faith we are made parta∣kers of Christ, and of the benefits of his passi∣on, which are set forth to us in the sacra∣ment: [we must bring faith to Gods pro∣mises, and Gods sacraments.] Heb. 3.14. Gal. 3.26, the second Grace is repentance: He must examine himselfe in that. Q. How will you know your repentance to be found? A. By two signes. Q. Whats the first? A. If I make conscience of every sin, even because it is sin. Luk. 16.10. Act. 24.16. Ps. 119.128. Gen. 39.9. [if we greive for sin because of shame that is a worldly respect,
and therefore a wordly sorrow, But if we greive for our sins because God is offended, that is a Godly sorrow, because the respect and ground of it is Godly.] Q. What is the second signe of sound re∣pentance? A. Amendment: and forsaking of sinne. [for true loathing and inard hatred of sin, is accompained with a leaving of it, else it is but a mock sorrow.] Act. 26.20. Ioel 2.13. 2. Cor. 10.11. Q. Why is this Grace required in a Communcant? A. Because God promiseth nothing to a wicked man, and therefore the sacrament cannot seale nor assure him of any mercy in Christ. Ro. 25. Mat. 3.7.8. Q. What is the Third Grace required in a worthy receiver? A. Care to walke in New obedience. (i.) to abstaine from evill, and exercise our selves in that which is Good. Ro. 12.9. Es. 1.16. Q. Why is new obedience required? A. Because if we say, we have fellow∣ship with Christ and walke in darknesse, we doe but deceive our selves. 1. Ioh. 1.6. 1. Ioh. 3.10. Q. What is the signe of true obedience?
A. Sincerity (i.) when without doubling of deceit, without dispensing or pretences for sin, we walke upright in the Commande∣ments of God. Ps. 32.2.1. Cro. 28.9.1. Cro. 12.33. [It is a spirit without guile, we must not hide our eies from any part of Gods will or of our duty.] Ps. 1 19.80. Q. What is the fourth Grace required in a worthy receiuer? A. Christian loue and Charity, especially towards all them that love and feare God. 1. Co. 5.8. Q. What is the first signe of Christian love? A. If we love the Children of God be∣cause they be the Children of God, and fear Him. 1. Ioh. 5.1. 1. Ioh. 3.12.14. Mat. 10.41. Q. What is the second signe? A. To do our brother no wrong but good if we can. Ro. 13.10.1. Cor. 1.5. Q. Whats a Third signe? A. If he hath wronged us to forgive him. Eph. 4.32. Mat. 6.14.15. Q. What is a fourth signe? A. A fellow-feeling of our Brothers weal and wo [(i.) if we can rejoyce at the good that befalls our Neighbor, in his wealth, cre∣dit, gifts, preferment, and graces, as if they had hapned to our selves; and on the other side, if we can heartly be sory for the disgra∣ces
and losses which befall our brethren.] Pro. 24 18. Iob 31.29.30. [especially if we can rejoyce and greive for such good and evills as befall them for Christs sake, Name and cause.] Q. Why is such love required in a Com∣municant? A. Because we are members of one Head Christ Iesus: and are all partakers of one Bread, one Hope, one Faith, and therefore should be of one minde and of one heart. Act. 4.32. Ioh. 13.35. Q. What if after examination we finde not these graces to be in our selves? A. They that be voide of these graces cannot be worthy receivers, But if we finde them to be in us in truth and sincerity, though not in that measure we desire, wee may and ought to come to the Lords Table. Q. By what meanes doth God worke these Graces in our hearts? A. By the word preached and heard with an honest heart: by which also they are dai∣ly increased. Ro. 14.10. Other Generall questions. Q. VVHat is the estate of man by Creation?
A. An holy and happy estate: for man was at the first made like unto God in holi∣nesse and righteousnesse, in goodnesse and immortallity. He was free from sinne and misery. Q. What is the estate of all men through the fall of Adam? A. An estate of sin and misery, for wee are all of us originally very sinfull and mise∣rable, Being enemies to all Goodnesse, and prone to all evill, and so the objects of Gods wrath, and heires of hell fire. Q. What is the state of them that be re∣nued by Christ? A. It is an estate of holinesse and righte∣ousnes, which is begun here in the kingdome of Grace, and shall be finished in the king∣dome of Glory. [They that are Christs, are renewed in knowledge and holinesse ac∣cording to that Image wherein Adam at the first was created, and they are acquitted from the guilt and punishment of sinne by the Blood and Intercession of Christ and finally, they are intituled to an estate of Glory and Immortality with God in Heaven for e∣vermore.] Q. How must we serve God here in this life? A. According to his word, and not accor∣ding to our owne fansies and devises.
Q. How must we pray to God! A. Only in the Name and mediation of Iesus Christ, praying for such things as are agreable to Gods will to give us. Q. How shall I know that? A. By the word of God which sheweth us what things God hath promised, and com∣manded and forbidden. Q. How else may I know what things I may beg of God in prayer? A. By the Lords prayer, wherein Christ hath taught us what to pray for, so that what∣soever we have need to pray for, or ought to pray for, it is contained in those Petitions. FINIS.
