When the Church hath chosen and called on Officer, they present him to the EldersActs 1.23. & 6.5, 6., who doe or∣daine him, if he be a Deacon, with Prayer, and Impositi∣an of handsActs. 6.6., and with Fasting also, if he bee an ElderActs 14.23.. 35. Qu. How are the Censures of the Church to be admini∣stred? Ans. The Censures of the Church are ordained by Christ for the removing of scandalls out of the ChurchMat. 18.16. to 15. Luk. 17.1, 2, 3., which if they be private (one Brother offending another) the offender is to goe and acknowledge his repentance of it unto his BrotherMat. 5.23, 24, who is then to forgive himLuk. 17.14., but if the offender neglect to doe it, the Brother offended is to goe and admonish him, and convince him of it betweene themselves privately. If thereupon the offender bee brought to repent of his offence, the Admonisher hath wonne his Brother: but if the offender heare not his bro∣ther, the brother offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established; whether the word of admoni∣tion, if the offender receive it, or the word of complaint to the Church, if he refuse it: for if he refuse it, the offen∣ded brother is to tell the Church, and if he refuse to heare the Church, then he is to bee counted as an Heathen and PublicanLuke 17.3. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17.. 36. Qu. What if the scandalls (or offences) be publike, how are they to be removed? Ans. By publique reproofe1 Tim. 5.20. Gal. 2.14., and if the offences be not onely publique but haynous, then the Church is to re∣move
the offence by Excommunicating the offender out of the Church1 Cor. 5.1.5. 1 Tim. 1.20.. 37. Qu. How is Excommunication to be administred? Ans. When the offence of any Brother is publique and haynous, or being private, is by the obstinacie of the of∣fender become publiquely scandalous, the Church beeing met together, is in the name and power of the Lord Je∣sus, and with his Spirit, to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, and the salvation of his soule in the day of the Lord Jesus1 Cor. 5.1.4, 5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Tim. 1.20. 2 Tim. 3.2, 5. Tit. 3.10, 11.. 38. Qu. Is there no use of Suspension in the Church? Ans. There may, to Members lying under the apparent guilt of sinne, after the admonition of the Church1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Thess. 3.14., discer∣ning the uncleane from the cleane, untill they bee clean∣sedDev. 10.10. Eze. 22, 26. Ier. 15.19.. 39. Qu. What is Anathema Maranatha? Ans. It is the utmost Censure of the Church, whereby a Brother falling from the love of Christ into hatred a∣gainst him, is cut off from fellowship with Christ for e∣ver, even to the comming of the Lord1 Cor. 16.22.. 40. Qu. Having seene what power of Governement the Church hath received and exercised within it selfe: tell mee now whether any Church hath power of governement over a∣nother? Ans. No Church hath power of Governement over a∣nother, but each of them hath chiefe power within it selfe, and all of them equall power one with another; e∣very Church hath received alike the power of binding, and loosing, opening and shutting the Kingdome of hea∣ven1 Mat. 18.17 18.. But one to another, all of them are SistersCant. 8, 8. Gal. 4.26.31, all of them ConcubinesCant. 6.8., but by their owne corruption or u∣surpation of othersRevel. 18.2.: finally all of them are Candlesticks of the same precious metall, and in the midst of them all Christ equally walkethRevel. 1.12, 13. & 2.1..
41. Qu. But if one Church have no power of Governement over another: what course then is there left to reform such cor∣ruptions as may arise in any Church, whether in Doctrine or practise? Ans. The corruptions that are found in any Church do either infect part of the Church, or the whole body: if part onely, then the part remaining sound, may either convince and reforme their Brethren themselves, if they be able; or if they be not able, they may at least prevaile so farre with them, as to send for light from some other Church, as they of Antioch did to the Church of Hierusa∣lemActs 15.2.. But if the corruptions found in a Church doe infect the whole body,Ezra 10.2. yet still there is hope in Israel concer∣ning this. For though one Church hath not power of Governement over another, as subordinate to them: yet every Church hath equall power one with another, as coordinate with them. And therefore look what pow∣er one Brother hath over another in the same Church, the same power hath one Church over another in Bro∣therly communion. As if one Church shall heare of any offence in another, they may enquire the certainty of itDeut. 13.14., and thereupon send letters and messengers, to convince and admonish them of it. If the Church offending doe heare the Church admonishing, they have gained their Brethren and their desire: if the Church heare them not, then that other Church may take one or two Churches moe, to assist them in the conviction of that sinne. If yet the Church heare them not, then upon due notice thereof given, all the Churches thereabout may so meet together, and after judicious enquiry into the cause, may by the word of God confute and condemne such errours in doctrine or practice, as are found offensive, to prevent the spreading either of the gangrene of heresie2 Tim. 2.17, 18., or of the leprosie of sinne1 Cor. 5.6, 7. And if the Church offending shall not yet hearken to their Brethren, though the rest of the Churches have not power to deliver them to Satan, yet they have power to withdraw from them the right hand of fellowship, and no longer to hold them in communion of Saints, till they approve their repentanceBy proporti∣on, from Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. 2 Thes. 3.6..
Isa. 33.22. The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King; he will save us. A Conclusion. J. C.THe Kingdom of Christ, whether in the hearts of his servants, or in Church State, and all the Administra∣tions thereof,See Mr. Taylor on Tit. 1.5. dispensed according to the Rule of the Gospel, doth not disturb the State, or Peace of earthly Kingdoms, or Common-wealths; And therefore, the gathering of Saints or Churches, according to the or∣der of Christ, and the guidance and walking of both ac∣cording to his will, is no just offence to the Civill Ma∣gistrate. Gal. 6.16. As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. FINIS.
