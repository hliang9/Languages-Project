THE SPEECH Of the HONOURABLE Sir WILLIAM WENTWORTH, One of His Majesties Privy Council in Ireland: To the Magistrates and Citizens of the City of Chester, in the Town-hall, before the Proclaiming of the King. GENTLEMEN, SINCE his late Majesty was pleased to do me that great Honour, as to make me one of his Privy Council in Ireland, and that his now Majesty is also graciously pleased to do me the same Honour, I think it my duty to declare to you what I know of this High and Mighty Prince, King James the Second: Who is the greatest Captain at Sea and Land now living, nor is there mention in History of any one which did ever equal him in both, for Cou∣rage, Skill, and Conduct. Never did so great a Warriour sit upon our Throne, never so great a Souldier wear our Crown, never any one of our Princes was more knowing in the Laws and Constitutions of these three Kingdoms; never any of greater Moderation, Sobriety, and Temperance. A more affectionate Brother was never known, nor a more Dutiful and Obedient Subject; else no∣thing could have made him absent himself, when so many Calumnies and Inju∣ries were falling upon him. I have followed this great King, and been with him in all the Countries and Places to which he was sent, and have heard him both in his Publick and Private Retirements, declare and promise that he would main∣tain the Church of England, as it is now Established, and upon my Life he will do it, and make it as great, nay greater, than either his Brother, Father or Grand-Father did; for he hath constantlye and faithfully preserved his Word and Promise, and I dare say, not one in these three Kingdomes, ever had either from him for any thing but he did perform it. He is a strict observer of Laws, no advan∣tage whatsoever could make him break any of them; a Prince he is that did ne∣ver fear any thing but to do an ill, or an unjust Act; and from doing Justice and maintaining His and his Peoples Rights, nothing whatsoever of danger or diffi∣culty
can stop or hinder him; and since his frequent and late promises to maintain our Church of England in its Rights, all the powers on Earth or their threats can make him break or depart from them; nor any person whatsoever, let his Authority be never so great, can make him forsake or recal the same: he will be sooner Torn in Pieces than be drawn from his word, nothing can separate him from his promises. I have heard him declare in the Parliament of Scotland, in an Excellent Speech, that he would maintain that Form of Government in their Church as truly as any one of his Predecessors had done; and yet he, as well as we, knows that upon it was built that late Horrid Rebellion, and like∣wise this last Damnable Conspiracy had thence much of its Rise, and I dare say at or before this day, he hath sent them all the assurances of performing it: and therefore how can we have the least apprehension he will not maintain this our Church, of which not one Member did ever forsake his Father's, or his Brothers Rights, and for which that Glorious Martyr (his Father) did chiefly suffer: There∣fore let no fear possess you, for he will endeavour its Peace and Prosperity. No∣thing so dear to him as the welfare of his People: God Almighty send him but length of days, then our Nation and Trades are sure to Flourish; then Glory and Riches will surely come and abide among us; then we shall all think our Lives and Fortunes well laid out; and given him, since there's nothing but his be∣ing taken away, can take away our Peace and Prosperity, let us all pray, God save the King, Long live the King. Amen. In the Castle when I began the Queens Health I then told them, that she was a Princess of the greatest Devotion, Bounty, and truest Charity of any one that ever lived; that all the Loveliness, Sweetness, and Charms both of Body and Mind that ever met in one person are found in her, and could we have but that Happiness added to our many, as to have a Prince from these two, Charles the Great, nor no Emperour would ever be so Glorious: A Blessing I and all that know her do daily Pray for, which God Almighty grant us. Amen. LONDON, Printed for W. H.
