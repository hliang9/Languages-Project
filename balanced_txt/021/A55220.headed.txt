PLUTO, the Prince of Darkness, His ENTERTAINMENT of Coll. Algernoon Sidney, Upon His Arrival at the INFERNAL PALACE. With the Congratulations of the Fanatick Cabal for his Arrival There. To the Tune of, Hail to the Mirtle shade, &c. PLƲTO. Room for great ALGERNOON, You Furies that stand in his way Let an Officer to Me come, Who serv'd me every day, Promoting Sedition and Evil, To alter the Church and the State, He deserves an Imployment in Hell, He has done great service of late. PLƲTO. He's one of the Damn'd old Crew, Who Voted the Death of the King, At Oxford again he did sue To be at the self-same thing. All Mischiefs on Earth de devis'd, All hazards he also did run, To render my Name solemniz'd With the Rabble of London Town. PLƲTO. TO MONARCHIE he was a Foe, RELIGION he always disdain'd, 'Gainst Government and Laws too, Damn'd Anarchy he mantain'd; I'll give Thee Preferment here, Since Engl. has banisht thee thence, Brave Sidney thou need'st not fear, Thou shalt have great recompence. SHAFTSBƲRY. Now Monarchy has prevail'd, Our Fanatick Plots to defeat, On whom is the Cause entail'd? Who'l stand it in spight of Fate? We that maintain'd it so long, From Justice were forced to fly; If you then had come along, You needed not there to die. ESSEX. The Factious are quite undone, For loss of the Fanatick Peers: Now Shaftsbury and I are gone, Poor Oates! has he lost his ears? For Monm. our Shams and Intrigues To th'world has plainly declar'd, And Howard our solemn Leagues, In the Plot a long time prepar'd, RƲSSELL. I'm glad you are safe arriv'd, Tho' I doubt you met Jack by the way; Now Monm. is reconcil'd, What a plague is become of Gray? Rebellion could ne'r disallow Conspiring against the Prince, Though I by a Sham-dying Vow Did plead great Innocence. London: Printed for a warning to all Traytors, 1684.
