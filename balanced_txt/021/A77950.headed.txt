A MEASURE OF THE TIMES: And a Full & Clear DESCRIPTION OF The Signes of the Times, and of the Changing of the Times; And of the Reign of Antichrist, who hath long reigned, and of his Down-fall, which is at hand; And of the Kingdom of Christ which is now setting up in the Earth. SHEWING Ʋnto all People in all Nations, What the state of things hath been in Ages past, and what the state of things are at this present day. (And also) what shall be the state of things hereafter, which suddainly com∣eth to passe, the time is at hand, for times are changing, and renewing, and the King∣domes of this world shall be Translated in∣to the Kingdome of the Son of God.
And also, Here it is manifest, concerning the Teachers of this age, and the root from whence they sprang, who are manifest to be of that stock of false Prophets, which Christ prophesi∣ed of should come, and which the Apostles saw was coming in their dayes, and how that the night of darknesse hath been upon all, for ma∣ny generations: and how that the Beast hath Reigned over Nations and Kingdomes, and his false Prophet hath deceived the whole world, who have all worshipped the Beast and wondred after him, who have warred against the Saints and overcome them, and the whole earth hath been made drunk with the abominations. And also, The Restauration is described, which shortly com∣eth, wherein Christ shall Reign, whose right it is, and shall change Laws and Decrees, and the Lamb shall be the Light of all Nations, and there shall be no need of any other light, when the Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdom of Christ, and he alone shall bear the Government, and no other King, for he shall rule all Nations with his Iron Rod, and the Kingdomes of the Beast shall be overthrown, and his power subdued, and they that have given their power unto Him shall be ashamed, and all the Kings of the earth shall lay their Crowns down at the feet of the Lamb, and the numberlesse number of the Saints is gathering, and the Dominion shall be in their hands, and their King shall po∣sesse the uttermost parts of the earth. By one who hath measured the times, who is come to the day that hath made all things manifest. EDW: BURROUGH. LONDON: Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth, near Aldersgate. 1657.
A MEASURE OF THE TIMES. THE Lord hath opened my heart to de∣clare; and the words of my mouth shall be the words of truth, and of a good un∣derstanding, to every one who hath an eare to hear: whose eare the Lord hath opened to hear, and understand things of old, and the state of things as they have been in ages, and generations, past; and as now the state of things are at this day. Hearken, and consider, and let your eares be open to instruction; For the word of the Lord is to∣wards you, that your hearts may understand the things that belongs to your peace, now in your day, before the time come that they be hid from your eye, and your eye be darkned, ne∣ver more to perceive, but you left to perish, and to die with the uncircumcised. Behold! and give eare, ye Inhabitants of the world; see, and consider, in what time you are fallen, even in a time of darknesse and Apostacy, wherein thick darknesse covered all the world, and a vaile of ignorance the faces of all people; Death hath reigned King over all, and the Cloud of thick blindnesse hath laid on the hearts of all men. O how hath darknesse, blindnesse, and ignorance, covered all men, even
as a cloak and a garment? How hath the eye been blinded, the eare stopped, and the heart hardned? So that the Lord God, and his way, his truth, and salvation, hath not been ma∣nifestly known, heard, nor felt, nor witnessed; for ages and generations: the words thereof have been professed, but the power and life thereof hath not been enjoyed. But men have been deceived with the forme of Godlinesse without the pow∣er, and cheated with a likenesse of things without life; and have sought the living among the dead, and worshipped Idols which have been without sence and understanding; and with lying imaginations, and feigned likenesses, hath the carnall part (which ruled in people above the seed of God) been fed, and with shadowes, and outward appearances, and the soule hath been starved. Alas, alas! woe is me because of these things; my heart within me is broken, and I am perplexed. The shadow of death hath been the lodging place of all people, and the vaile of ignorance hath been a covering, and the darknesse of heart hath been followed for a Law, and a blind understanding have been the guide, for ordinances and statutes: and Death in the beastly power hath ruled as King, in all the dominions of the earth, and in all mens hearts; and men hath been without the wisdome of God, even every eye blind, and every eare deafe, and every tongue dumb, and every heart corrupt, and void of understanding, and every foot lame, and all men have been altogether imperfect; for the living God hath been as a stran∣ger unto the children of men, lesse known by men then the owner to the Ox, and lesse perceived then the crib by the asse, and all flesh hath corrupted its way before the Lord. Woe is me! when I consider, how man who was planted with the choisest vine, even Gods image, and was a noble plant, is degenerated into the plant of a strange vine, unto God, and brings forth wilde grapes, and soure grapes, which the Lords soule loathes; and thus have the vineyard, and the plants thereof, rewarded the husbandman, with fruit of a bitter tast, and with the reward of corruption; And man is condemned in his transgression, for want of the knowledge of God, more then the Oxe, and the Asse.
Pride, covetousness, lust, and envy, backbiting, lying, drun∣kennesse, whoredome, theft, murder, and all manner of evill, and sin against God, more then can be expressed, is abounding, and supera bounding among men in this Generation. Iniquity is grown to the full, the measure is up, and the number of trans∣gression is sealed, that the Lord may arise, who hath been pres∣sed as a cart with sheaves; and now is the Lord arifing, and he hath said, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and be avenged on my oppressors. And vengeance belongs to him, and he will repay, and will destroy the vineyard with the plants and fruits thereof, and the bryers and thorns shall be consumed, and he will lay wast, and devoure, and confound all his enemies in a day, when his indignation goes forth, and his sword is made bare, and his purpose cometh to pass, in rooting out the oppres∣sive seed of evill doers, which hath filled his habitation, where∣in he should dwell, with cursed children, and a brood of evill births. In the dayes of Christ, and his Apostles, was the hand and power of the Lord felt, and the Lord gat himselfe a name and a glory; and he caused his marvelous light to spring forth, and his day to dawn, and the day was manifest, that many Pro∣phets and wise men had desired to see, but was not in their time seen by them, and his power was made known, and his arme was made bare in the sight of many Nations; and in that day his glory was spread abroad, and his truth and way was exalted, and his glorious Gospell was declared through the earth, and the sound of his marvelous works went forth into all the world; judgement and mercy was known, and righte∣ousnesse and peace was witnessed among men, and life and im∣mortallity was brought to light through the Gospel, and the word of life by which all things was created, and by which they stand, was handled, seen, felt, and tasted, and the Lord God in that age was known to dwell with his people, and to walk in them, and his Covenant was established with many, and his promises was fulfilled; redemption, deliverance and salvation, was revealed, even Christ Jesus the Son of God, the Prince of peace; And righteousnesse was made manifest in the sons of men, and revealed in many who saw Gods glory, and was wit∣nesses
of his majesty and dominion, and were gathered unto him in the bond of peace, and were his sons and daughters, and were led by his Spirit in all his wayes of truth and righteous∣nesse. And many went forth into the world and declared through Nations the things of Gods kingdome, which was come to them, and was discovered within them; and the Lord God spake from Heaven by his Son unto them, and they were filled with the holy Ghost, and with power. And the Lord was with them whom he called, and made them wise, and their word powerfull, and their message effectuall, and their weapons were mighty through God, and strong holds were subdued, and the powers of death and darkness were subjected, and the hearts of thousands were turned to God, and the Go∣spell was preached in power through the world, and many were brought to God, out of darknesse into light, and from Satans power unto God. And the earth was filled with Light, and the mighty and the wise were confounded, and the bonds of cruel oppressions were broken, and they that set themselves against the Lord and his way were confounded, and scattered, and brought to naught, though they were many in that generation. How did all the chief Priests, and Scribes, and Pharises, Elders of the People, and Rulers, and Governors, lift up themselves in the Pride of their hearts, and took Counsel together, and perse∣cuted the innocent, and put to death and imprisoned the chil∣dren of the most high? How did they in the dayes of Christ persecute and seek for his life, till they had taken it from the earth by their subtilty and wickednesse? The Apostles and Ministers of Christ were persecuted, some was put to death, and others suffered grievous things for the Name of Christ, and were made a prey and a spoyle unto destroyers, whose wickednesse increased against the way of God, till it was ful∣filled in its measure, and the wicked with their works were dashed to pieces; and the Lord gave his way, and truth, and servants, dominion and power over all his enemies, and whole Nations were brought to the knowledge of God and his ways, and his name was glorious, and his kingdome was exalted in the earth, and many were his people, who were gathered by
him, and his powerfull word, through the mouth of his mini∣sters; whom he ordained, and called, who were fishermen, and such like, who were chosen to fullfill his will, and to doe his worke, and not many wise men of the world were called, but God chose the foolish things to confound the wise, then as he doth now; and such were honoured by the Lord, and bearers of his name, and of his message, and glad tideings, though they were contemned of men; yet unto such he gave the authority to overturne the wise, and to outreach the wise∣dome of this world, for they were learned of the father, and had the knowledge of his wayes though they were unlearned in the arts, and crafts of men, which stands more in pollicy, and subtilty, then in the feare, and wisdome of God; and in that day the Lord was with his people, while his people was with him, and he loved them while they stood in his counsell, and he gave them dominion over all their enemies; and they were a terrour to the whole world, while the churches stood in the dread, and terrour of the Lord of hoasts, yea all bowed under them, and their feet trod upon the high places of the earth, and they were blessed of the Lord, above all people; e∣ven till they waxed fat, and were increased in treasures, and thought they had need of nothing, and then they forgat God, and rebelled against him, and became perverse in their wayes, and grew into strange Idolatries, and errors, and left the way of truth, and cast Gods Law behinde them; and the power of godlinesse ceased, and the forme grew, and it was exalted more then power, and love waxed cold, when iniquity abounded; and men became lovers of themselves, more then of the Lord; and the Lord, and his marvellous workes which had been brought to passe were forgotten, and hardnesse of heart, and unbeliefe entered, and then the false prophets, and antichrists came in, which Christ had prophesied of, and established the forme of godlinesse, without the power, and subverted many (even whole houses, and Countries) from the simplicity of Christ Jesus; so that many became insensible, and grew past feeling of the power, and operation of God, and their minds became blinded, and their eares stopped; and God was grie∣ved, who had brought up children, and they forgat him, and
rebelled against him; for the Churches became corrupted, and lost the life, and power of God, and the holy ghost; and be∣came Idolaters, and worshipers of Idolls, and as you may read Paul prophesied that many should depart from the faith, and give heed to seducing spirits, and to the doctrine of Devills; and grievous wolves should enter, not sparing the flock, but seeking to devoure it, and would make havock, and merchan∣dise of soules, through coveteousnesse, and filthy lucre, and perilous times would come, wherein their should be a forme of godlinesse, and not the power; and in that generation be∣fore, and soone after his decease, this came to passe, and was fullfilled; and as you may read in the revelations the churches grew into superstitions, and Idolatries, the church of Ephesus had lost her first love, and her candlestick was to be removed, and so it came to passe; and some in the church of Smyrna were in the blasphemy, saying they were Jewes, and were not, but were the sinagogues of Satan; and the church of Perga∣mos, some among them held the doctrine of Balaam, and to eat things sacrificed to Idolls, and to commit fornication, and some held the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which God hated, and against them would the Lord fight with the sword of his mouth; and the church of Thyatira suffered that woman Jezabell to prophesie, and to teach, and seduced the servants of the Lord to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto Idolls; and she, and her lovers was to be cast into a bed of torment, and her children should be killed with death; and all the churches should know, that God searched the reines, and the hearts, and every one should receive according to their deeds; and the church of Sardis had only a name to live, but was dead, and her work was not perfect before God, and upon them would the Lord come as a thiefe, and they should be in darknesse, and not know what houre he would come. And the church of the Laodiceans were luke warme, and neither hot, nor cold, and the Lord would spew her out of his mouth, for she was wretched, and miserable, and poore, and blinde, and naked, and the shame of her nakednesse did ap∣peare; and if any had an eare to heare, they might heare; these things were spoken by him that lives for ever, the first,
and the last, the beginning, and the Amen; so that hereby the Lords soul was vexed, and his spirit grieved, and his wrath was suddenly kindled against them, who were revolters, and backsliders from his way of salvation, which he had made ma∣nifest to them, through the mouth of his servants; so that his fury went out against them to overthrow them, and to break them to pieces; and they being turned from his Law, and from his statutes, he gave them up unto their own hearts desire, and brought in the heathen upon them, to confound them, who broke them asunder, and trod down many of their Cities, and gained great Ports of their dominions, and made them slaves by multitudes, and overthrew their worship, and subject∣ed their power; even the Turks, and base uncircumcised people made a prey upon them, and possessed their habitations, and set up abominable Idolatries in the place where Gods honour had dwelt; and their dominions, and treasures without, be∣came spoyle to the teeth of devourers; for they having lost the terrour, of the Lord, he brought up the heathen to be a terrour unto them, whose power was mightier then they, and overcame them, they being without the power of God; and this justly came upon them, according to the purpose of the Lord, because of their backslidings; And others of them, who was not so given up to the will of an outward enemy, yet were they given up to strange Idolatries and subversion, and setting up images, and worshiped that which is not God, but abomi∣nation to him, to this day; so that the holy City, which had been full of glory, was given to the Gentiles to be troden downe; and under their poluted feet hath it been stamped, and to their mouth hath it been a prey, for such a time, even since these things came to passe, unto this day; as you may read, and the Beast and false Prophet, hath ruled in oppression, and the great whore hath made all Nations drunke with the wine of her fornication; All the great men, and Princes, and nobles, and all the people upon earth have been made drunke by her, and touched her uncleannesse, and ever since the day wherein the backsliding entered, she hath fit upon nations, and kindreds, and tongues, and people, and hath been decked in divers colours, to deceive the hearts of all people, and all
Nations have been deceived by her, and the beast and his pow∣er, whose dominion hath been great, hath upheld wickednesse by a Law, and established Idolatry by decrees, and all have been out of the way, and wandring in blindnesse, and dark∣nesse, even the whole world have worshiped the Beast, and gone after the false Prophet, which sits upon the Beast, and his power protects him, till they be both overthrowne into perdi∣tion, and cast alive into the Lake, which now the Lord is come∣ing to doe in power, and dominion: and great Babylon is coming into remembrance before the Lord, and as she hath done, so shall it be done to her, her children is dashing against the stones, and her offspring is withering away, and the dark∣nesse is vanishing, and the Sun is appearing, and the beastly power shall be subdued, and the false Prophet confounded, e∣ven the old Dragon shall be bound, and chained, never more to deceive; for the Beast hath had a long reigne with his false Prophet, who have prophesied lies, and false divinations, and led away the minds of all people. For marke; and consider, Christ Jesus who came into the world, with glad tidings of good things, even with peace, and salvation: he said the glorious day was come, and even that day which many Prophets and wise men had desired to see, but had not seen; the earth was filled with light, as I have said, yet he farther prophesied, and said, that the night would come when no man could work, and that in the last dayes false Pro∣phets should arise, and deceive many, and should come into the world, and should cry loe here, and loe there is Christ, and and if it were possible should deceive the very elect; and the Apostle John in his time, who had been an eye-witnesse of Je∣sus, and had handled, and tasted, and felt the word of life, and had been with Jesus, and bore a true testimony unto him; in that very age, and generation, he saw the false Prophets, and antichrists come, and coming in, and aluded to the very say∣ings of Christ, by this we know said he, that it is now the last time, for there are now many false Prophets, and antichrists gone out into the world, they were not of the true Apostles, but went out from among them, (being gone out from the light in their own particulars) and beguiled the hearts of the
simple, by good words, and faire speeches, and went in Ba∣laams way for gifts and rewards, and in Caines way to envy, and murder, as you may read in the Scripture; so that in Johns time, the false Prophets which Christ foretold off, were come, and they did deceive many according as Christ had said, and they drew many from the wayes of God, and subverted many from the truth, and made havocke of the flock, and were grie∣vous wolves, according as Paul had said, and truth began to perrish from among men, and the power thereof ceased, and the apostacy came in, and the forme was set up for a season; so that John farther saw, and said the whole world went after the Beast and false Prophet, whom he saw before was come, and worshiped the Beast, and his image. But a few whose names were written in the book of life; and as I have said the holy City with the outward Court, was troden down by the Gentiles foot, and darknesse surprized all, and wickednesse a∣bounded more, and more; and the night came upon all, as Christ had prophesied, and the Beast grew in his dominion: till there was hardly any man left to beare witnesse in the truth, and in the power of God, unto the name of Jesus; but all was subverted into dead formes, and shaddowes, and like∣nesses without life, and the Lord left the earth, as it were, and covered himselfe in the darknesse; and became a stranger in the world, and did scarce openly speake by vision, nor dream, nor Prophet, but all were left in the darke, and ignorance a∣bounded, and superstition was exalted; the Saints spirit, and se which they were in, and guided by was lost, and then they began to worship the Saints names, and dayes, and words, without the life, and power; and that nature, and that same seed which had persecuted the Saints to death, and gainsayed the pover; and lost the holy ghost, turned it selfe into the professin of the Saints words, which were left upon record; and confirmed it selfe into the Saints practises, without the life, power and holy ghost. And having lost the power, from which the Sripture was given forth, and not being guided in the life whic they were in, which spoke it forth; then from the Scripture  mens own conceptions, and thoughts, and by their reason, whout Gods Spirit, they set up likenesses, and
images, and sects, and formes, and many heads, and many hornes grew upon the beast which all the world worshiped, and went after; for they had lost Christ the one head, wherein the union stood, and grew into Idollitry, under the many heads which was upon the Beast, who had many hornes, which push∣ed one against another, as it is witnessed unto this day; doe not the Papists, and Protestants (so called) and other sects risen out of them, push one at another, to break, and teare one another; and these have many heads. The Pope he is a head, and the others they have a head, which every one bowes down under his own head; the Pope will not bow to the Pro∣testants head, nor will the Protestants bow to the Papists head, the Presbiterians, and Independants, and Anibaptists, and the rest, every one of them bowes to their own head, and will not bow to anothers head. and all these with their hornes pushes one against another, to rend one another; and all these are from Christ, and knowes not him the one head of the whole body, and the one horn of Gods salvation, unto all people: for Christ which is but one is the head, and the horne, which all the Saints, who are now gathered out of this apostacie, and dark night, unto whom the Light againe is risen, worships Christ the one head, and knowes him the one horn, which pushes against the Devils Kingdome, which hath long been set up, and ruled in the earth among all these, who have many heads, and many hornes, who are all of them (the very chie∣fest) but in the night fallen, in the apostacie, and darknesse, since the beginning of the reigne of the Beast, and the comig in of the false Prophet, which came in as I have said when the churches backslided, with the whore also, who have mad all Nations, and people drunk with the wine of her forniction; and the Beast hath reigned over all Nations in his dominion, and authority, and the false Prophet hath prophesied through all nations. And all these came in since the dayes of Christ; or he pro∣phesied that it should be so, as it is come to passe; and they were coming in, in the dayes of the Apostles, as you may read Paul saw them coming, and largely describes heir character in severall epistles. And Peter he saw them coming in, and de∣scribed
them, what such they were, and should be; and Jude he saw them also, and John more fully then any, both in his e∣pistles, and revelations; as I have hinted at. And when the A∣postles were taken of the earth, some by cruell death, and o∣thers was banished, then they sprung in more fully, and grew through all Nations; and to this day hath the Beast, with his many heads, and hornes, ruled in Nations, and been worshiped, and his false prophet hath ever since been defended, and riden on the Beast, through Nations, and hath deceived the Nations with vanity, and errour; and at this very day the Nations, and people are deceived, and lies under darknesse, in the slave∣ry and bondage, under the authority of the Beast, and subject to the doctrine of his false Prophets. And as I have said darknesse hath been over all, and fancies, and liknesses without life have been bowed under, and the power being lost, the forme hath been set up, one after this sort, and another after that, according to mens vaine conceits, and apprehensions upon the Scriptures, and not according to the manifestation of the Spirit of God, which fulfills the Scrip∣tures, and brings to live the life of them. So in divers colours, and in divers appearances, and Robes, in severall formes, and shapes of garments hath the great whore been decked, who hath sit upon the Beast, haveing the false Prophet serving as a boy, or servant, to doe whatsoever the whore listeth. And the false Prophet, this servant to the whore, under the power of the Beast, hath moved, and turned as the Beast would. And according as the whore hath chan∣ged her selfe into other garments, and colours; even so hath the false Prophet changed his doctrine, and prayers to please the whore, and to keepe people under the goverment of the Beast. It's knowne in this our day, that some who preached, and prayed for the King, and Bishops, doe now preach, and pray for others, even for them who destroyed King, and Bi∣shops; so the false Prophet with all his children, is but the whores servant, who hath made drunk Kings, and Princes, and great men, and people, and Nations, with the cup of for∣nication, and abomination, in the severall sects, and formes of worships, which hath been set up, without the power of god∣linesse;
for the Babtisme of the Spirit being lost, and not known, then from the letter by imaginations, were severall sorts of Baptisme brought forth, as sprinkling of infants, that darke folly, and vaine vanity, which all these Nations have been deceived withall, by the exercise of the false Prophet. And when the gift of the ministery, through the holy ghost, which the ministers of Christ had, was lost, and not any more received. Then began men to make Ministers, by naturall learning, and artes, and languages, and humane pollicie, and when the gift of preaching by the eternall Spirit was lost, through the coming in of the Apostacie, then began men to study from Books, and writings, what to preach, and say, not having the holy ghost received in them, which none is a minister of Christ without, (marke that) and when men had, lost through ig∣norance, the knowledge of God dwelling in them, and that their bodyes was his temple, and that he dwelled and walked in his people, then began they againe to build Temples with∣out, and to set up their false worships in them; for having lost the sense of Gods true worship, which the Saints worshi∣ped in, in the Spirit, and in the truth. Then they began to worship in set dayes, and set times, and set places, and outward observances, which is not the worship of God in the Spirit, and in the truth, but superstitious, and Idolatrous; and when the word of God was not received immediately from his mouth, nor the Gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ, as it was in the dayes of the Apostles, then (darknesse being come in) they used their tongues when the Lord had not spoken to them, as the false Prophets did before Christs time; and long have they said the letter is the word, and that the letter is the Gospel, and that it must be received by the Scriptures, and by naturall learning, and artes, and that none can be ministers of Christ, but such who are learned in the languages, and knowes the originall of Scriptures, Latine, and Greek, and Hebrew, not any of these have received the Gospel, by revelation, or the word of God from his mouth. And when singing in the Spirit, and with understanding was ceased, and not knowne then began people to get the forme of singing of Davids ex∣periences
in rime, and meeter; and when the pure power of godlinesse was lost, which was in the dayes of the Apostles manifested, and known, then in the Apostacie, the deceit grew into the forme of every thing, which the Saints had enjoyed in the power; and so was shaddowes set up instead of substance, and death instead of life, and the forme without the power, which in many branches sprang forth, some into one appea∣rance, and some into another; but all under the power of the Beast, with his many heads, and hornes defended; and untill this day, since the dayes of the Apostles, thus it hath been, and those very teachers, and supposed ministers, which now are in this, and other Nations, are of that very root which sprang forth in the dayes of the Apostles; and they are under the dominion of the Beast, and moveable like unto the great whore; and this may easily be proved that they are of that generation of teachers, and false Prophets, which Christ pro∣phesied of should come, and which the Apostles saw was com∣ing in their dayes, and of those which John saw the world to run after; for Christ said by their fruites they should be known, and the Apostles they described their fruits, and them by their fruites; And so we seeing their fruit to be the very same now, which the Apostles described was the fruit of them, that then was come, and coming; from whence we doe con∣clude according to sound judgment, that these very teachers are of the same generation, and branches of the same root, which sprang forth then. And in Pauls writeings you may read, such they were, whom he saw, of whom he bad people to beware, and said perilous times would come, and men should be lovers of themselves, covetons, proud, blasphemers, disobe∣dient to parents, unthankfull, unholy, without naturall affecti∣on, false accusers, fierce dispisers of those that are good, hea∣dy, high minded, lovers of pleasures, more then lovers of God, having a forme of godlinesse, but denying the power, and such of whom people were ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; for people were laden with sins, and led away with divers lusts; and these did resist the truth, as Jannes, and Jambres who withstood Moses, by mak∣ing likenesses without life, and they were men of corrupt
minds, and reprobate concerning the faith. Now it is plaine that these teachers in this generation are of that very stock which Paul describes, such he saw would come, and such we see are come, and by their fruits we know them, as Christ said; and Pauls words are fullfilled, for these teachers are lovers of themselves, and covetous, and proud, this is plaine to all peo∣ple; and blasphemers, who denyes Christ to have lighted e∣very man that comes into the world, and therefore they deny Scripture, and so are disobedient, and unholy men, and with∣out naturall affection, who many of them have caused the in∣nocent to be imprisoned, and some have dyed in Prison, and they the chiefe cause of this, and this is without naturall affe∣ction to the creatures; and they are false accusers, and liers, and fierce in their books and preaching, as is manifest through all this Nation; and they greatly despise those that are good, and prepares war against such, as doth not put into their mouthes; and they are heady, and high minded, and lovers of vanities, and pleasures, this is evident without proofe, and they have a forme of godlinesse; they say all should be taught of God, but when any comes to witnesse it, and denyes their teaching, they cry against such as Heriticks, and thus they have the words, and the forme, but denyes the power; and they are ever teaching twenty and fourty yeares, and more, but none able ever to come to the knowledge of the truth by them, but il in blindnesse, and darknesse still, and people cryes out, who have been learning many yeares from them, that they doe not know the truth; and its plaine that these teachers are of that sort, that Paul spoke of, who brings none to the knowledge of the truth; for people that followes them are laden with sins, and led away with divers lusts; and these have, and doe resist the truth every where; they deny that Christ hath lighted every man that comes into the world, and so resists truth, and denyes Scripture, and the truth, as you may read, John 1. 9. And they are corrupt minded, even wicked persecutors, and suers at Law, and earthly minded, and covetous, and oppressors, and are wholly reprobate con∣cerning the faith; and thus it is plaine that the root of these teachers was springing in the Apostles dayes, and hath growen
ever since in this darke night of Apostacie, and hath filled the Nations. Againe, the Apostle saw that many should depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of Devils, speaking lies in hypocrisie, having their consciences seared as with a hot Iron. Now these teachers are of that stock which is departed from the true faith; for they are without true faith, and reprobate concerning it, who are in iniquity, and sin, and the workes of the world which are evill; now faith purifies the heart from all this; but their hearts are not puri∣fied, but poluted with covetousnesse, and preaching for hire, and persecuting, and envy; and therefore they have not faith, and so are of that generation which departed from the faith, after the Apostles times, which they saw would come; and these doth seduce, and their doctrines are of the Devill, who denyes the truth which the Scripture beares witnesse of; and saith sprinkling infants with water, when they are two or three days old is Baptisme into the faith of Christ; this is the doctrine of the Devill, and lies they speak in great numbers, and in hypocrisie, and writes them forth to the world in great hypocrisie, with feignednesse, and pretence of holinesse; and its plaine many of their consciences are seared; how doe many of them cause the poore people to suffer grievous imprison∣ment, and spoyling of their goods, to the ruine of families al∣most, for their maintenance, as tythes, and such like, which if their consciences were not seared they could not doe; also some of them cryed to the rude wicked people, in their Idoll Temples, fight lads for the Gospel; and many who have borne witnesse to the truth, and against their deceits, have been beat, and abused, and knocked downe as for dead in their presence; and their consciences are absolute seared, else they would tremble at these things. Also the Apostle Peter, he saw false Prophets would come in, 2 Pet. 2. And false teachers, who would bring in damna∣ble heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them; and many should follow their pernicious wayes, and through cove∣tousnesse with feigned words, they would make merchandize of people; and they would walke after the flesh in the lust
of uncleanesse, and despise government, and be presumptuous, and selfe willed, and not afraid to speak evill of dignities, and they would speak evill of things they understand not, and their hearts are exercised with covetous practises, and were cursed children, and they sport themselves with their own deceivings, and these had forsaken the right way, and are gone astray fol∣lowing the way of Balaam, who loved the wayes of unrighte∣ousnesse, and these are clouds that are carryed with a Tempest, and they speak great swelling words of vanity, and while they promise to others liberty, themselves are the servants of cor∣ruption. And such were scoffers, and mockers which would come after the Apostles dayes, and they would walke after their own lusts. And now according to this prophesie of Peter, who saw false teachers coming in, he gave these characters of them, whereby it doth plainly appeare that this generation of tea∣chers are they, and of that stock which then came in; for these brings forth the very same fruits, which they did, which he spoke of, and we knowe them by their fruits, as Christ hath said; for these have filled the world with damnable heresies, as holding forth that sprinkling infants with water is baptisme into the faith of Christ, and that a sleeple-house is the church, and that singing Davids experiences in the world a∣mong wicked people in rime, and meeter, is singing to the praise of God, and these are damnable heresies, even to the de∣nying the Lord that bought them; for they deny the light of the Lord Jesus Christ given to every man to be the only tea∣cher, and the only guide of man, and they that doe deny the light of Christ with which every man that comes into the world is lighted to be sufficient to lead to Christ, and to the Kingdome of God (as these teachers in this age doe) they deny the Lord that bought them; and many, even whole Nations, all the world as John saw in the revelations have fol∣lowed their pernicious wayes, and run after their Idolatry, and pernicious wayes of superstitions, and they doe make mer∣chandize of soules, through covetousnesse with their feigned words; for where they can make their bargaine to have the most money, there they will preach, and no where else, and if
any will give them more the next yeare, they will sell that people, and goe to another, for very covetousnesse, by feigned words, and they doe walke after the flesh, in the lust of pride, and covetousnesse, which is uncleanesse of the flesh; and they despise the Saints government and order; for they will not suffer the Saints to prophesie one by one in their assemblies, according to the Saints government, but doth despise that, and persecute it by the government of the Beast, unto whose government they are subject, and not to the government of Christ, and the Saints; and thus they are presumptuous, and selfe-willed, presuming to afflict, and cause the children of God to be cast into prison, and suffering them to be beat, and abused by their flock, out of their wicked selfe wills, and they are not afraid to speak evill of dignities, and doth speak evill of the wayes of God, and of his truth which they understand not; and their hearts are exercised with covetous practises, and are cursed children; for they make poor people that hath but ten eggs give them one, and that hardly can get any fewell for the fire, pay them a penny for the smoake; with such ma∣ny other exceeding covetous practises, as suing men two hundred mile to answer for three shillings claimed by them for tithes. And these sport themselves in their vanities, in their own deceiving, and when they have oppressed people for their wa∣ges, and makes people pay them for whom they doe no work, and forces wages from them that never hired them, which is unheard of, covetous practises; they sport themselves in their pride, and lustfullnesse, and they are out of the right way, and gone astray from the wayes of God which are holy, and are in the way of Balaam, who went after unrighteous wages, who sought for enchantment against Jsrael, as these doe; and these loves unrighteous wages, by taking maintenance from people by force, unto whom is nothing oweing by them, and these are carried with a Tempest of every wind, according as the powers of the earth blowes, these are carried sometime un∣der such a government, and sometime against it, and so are clouds carried about, and are unsetled on the foundation, and they speak great words of Christ, and God, and the Scriptures,
which are but words stolen by them, because they are not spoken by the Spirit of God, but by a lying Spirit, and they promise to others liberty, that they shall receive the King∣dome of God after death, and that Christ hath taken away their sins, with such like promises of liberty, but themselves are the servants of corruption, living in pride, and hatred, and covetousnesse, and these serve sin, and are servants of corrup∣tion; and they are scoffers, and mockers, and walkers after their own lusts, as it is evident in all mens sight. So that ac∣cording to the judgment of truth, we judge these teachers of this generation, to be of the same root which then sprang forth; for these brings forth the same fruites, as they in that time did; and in the apostacy they have over-spread the whole world; and also the Apostle Jude gave a description of them, according as Peter had done; he saw certaine men creeping in, who turned the grace of God into wantonnesse, and they were filthy dreamers, and knowes nothing, but what they know naturally, as bruit Beasts, and in that they corrupt themselves; and they have gone in the way of Caine, and run greedrly after the errour of Balaam, and they are trees whose fruit withereth, rageing waves of the Sea, foaming out their own shame, wandering Starres, they are murmurers, and complainers, walking after their own lusts, having mens per∣sons in admiration, because of advantage, and these seperate themselves sensuall, having not the Spirit; and of this sort which Jude describeth are these teachers in this generation, whose fore fathers crept in, in the Apostles dayes, and these are their cursed children, which now abounds in these Nati∣ons at this day; and they are filthy dreamers, studying for what they speak, and dreaming without the Spirit of God an houre in a Pulpit, and what they know it is naturally, by na∣turall learning, and naturall arts, and in that knowledge they are also corrupted, in pride, and vaine glory, and vanities, like bruit Beasts in their apparrell, and practises, and not like ministers of the Gospel nor Saints; and they are in Caines way, in envy, and murder, and wrath, abounding; no people like them, and they doe run greedily after Balaams errour, for gifts, and rewards, and unrighteous wages, which they run
after greedily; and they are trees who brings forth these cur¦sed fruits, which will wither, and fade away; and they are like raging proud waves of the Sea, foaming out their shame in lies, and slanders, and cursed speaking, in publick, and pri∣vate, and they have no habitation in the firmament of God, but are wandering Starres, and sometime in one opinion, and sometime in another, but the blacknesse of darknesse is reser∣ved for them, and the judgment of the great day; and they are murmurers, and complainers, and they can never have e∣nough, but seekes for their gaine from their quarter, as the false Prophets did in Isaiahs time, and they have mens persons in admiration, because of advantage to themselves, bowing, and worshiping mens persons, who will advantage them in their wages, or hire, and maintenance, begging favour of the Magistrates, and having their persons in admiration, that they may have their advantage in oppressing poor people in tythes, in this, their wickednesse is hard to be expressed; and these have seperated themselves, into selfe seperation, some into one forme gathered, and some into another, but all sensuall, and in the wisdome which is from below, and without the Spirit of God, And thus it is proved that these teachers of this age are of the same geeration, in their practises, which Jude describeth to be creeping in in his time. And farther the Apostle John 1. epistle 4. He saw that the false Prophets, and Antichrists, which Christ prophesied of to come, was come in his dayes, and said many false Prophets are gone out into the world, which is the Spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard, said John, and even now already is it in the world, and they were of the world, and the world heard them; and so are this ge∣neration of teachers, who succeeds them that went forth into the world then; these are of the world, in its wayes pride, and wickednesse, covetousnesse, and envy, and all evill, and they that are in the evill of the world, in wickednesse heareth them, and maintaineth them; so that according to Johns description, these teachers of this age are of that same flock which came in then; and John further saw that all the world was gone after them, and worshiped the Beast which was then risen,
and run after the false Prophet, which then came in, and fat upon the Beast, and its plaine that the world is all run after them, untill this day, which is a day of bringing back againe from the false Prophet, and from under the power of the Beast, and the Beast, and his image; and the false Prophet, and his divinations must down to the ground; and according as John further prophesied, the holy Citywhich had been troden down under the Gentiles feet, for such a time should againe be gai∣ned, and the Saints should have the dominion, and the old Dragon should be chained, and Christ should reigne, and his Kingdome should be set up in the earth, and the Tabernacle of God should be with men; and this is the day that the Lord is restoring againe the way of peace, which long hath been lost, and the power of God is againe witnessed, which hath not been known for generations. So that of things spoken this is the sum of truth, and the word of the Lord God to all people on the earth; that in the dayes of Christ, and the Apostles, it was a glorious day of light, and life, and power, and the Lord gathered a people which honoured his name, while they stood with him, and in his counsell walked; but since the dayes of the Apostles, hath been an Apostacy▪ and darknesse over all, and a subversion upon all, and night have been over all, wherein no man could work as Christ said, and formes without power have been esta∣blished, the pure way of God hath not been known in its puri∣ty; so that this time wherein all are fallen, is a time of igno∣rance, of the reigne of the Beast, which all the world hath wandred after, and a time wherein the Gentiles feet hath tro∣den down the holy City, and a time wherein all the world runs after the false Prophet, and are deceived, and made drunk with the wine of the whores fornications. I say this is the time wherein all the men of this generation are fallen, and the Scrip∣ture is fulfilled, the night wherein no man can work is upon the world, and further this is the time of Antichrists dominion, which hath exalted himselfe in the seat of God, shewing him∣selfe to be God; and long hath he reigned with the Beast and the false Prophet, ever since the dayes of the Apostles; and these same teachers of this generation which now are in the
world are manifest by their fruit, to be of that generation of that seed, and flock of false Prophets, which Christ prophesi∣ed of should come in the last time after his dayes, and which most of the Apostles saw coming in, in their dayes, by their fruites I say they are known, for these brings forth the same fruites, and beares the same markes which they described those did, in their time; so we see Christs prophesie is fulfilled, who said they should come; for they are come, and the Apostles descriptions are fullfilled on these; for these teachers are such as beares the same characters as is proved, as they said they should beare that would come; and long hath the Nations been deceived, and kept under the worship of the Beast, run∣ning after the false Prophet; and we see Johns prophesie is fulfilled, who said that the holy City was given to be troden under the feet of the Gentiles; for so we see it hath been for many generations, and also we know the time is now approa∣ching, that the dominion of the Beast is near an end, and the holy City shall the Saints possesse, and the Gentiles shall be driven out of it, according as John said, who wrote the last of any of the Apostles, and gave full testimony of these things which I have declared of, (viz.) of an Apostacy, and reigning of the Beast, and false Prophet, and a subversion from the wayes of God; and this hath been, and come to passe; also he prophesied of the gaining of the holy City, in again to the Saints, and of a restoration, wherein new Jerusalem should be made manifest from heaven, and should againe be adorned, as a bride for her husband, and the Saints should inhabit it, and the Tabernacle of God should be with men upon earth, and the Lord would dwell for ever with his people; and this day is approaching nigh at the doors, for the fig tree hath blosso∣med, and we know it is near at hand, the summer wherein the glory of the Lord shall be revealed unto all Nations, and they shall know that he is the Lord God Almighty that will take vengeance upon the great whore, who hath made all drunk with the wine of her fornication. And now after the long night of Apostacy, and darknesse which hath been upon the face of the earth, is the Lord ap∣pearing, and his day dawning, and his light breaking forth as
the glory of the morning, and the Kingdome of God is revea∣led, and his dominion is setting up, after the long reigne of the Beast, who hath had his power, and his seat, and his great authority from the dragon, after whom the whole world hath wandered, and him hath worshiped, who have been saying who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make war with him? his mouth for many generations hath been opened in blas∣phemy against God, and his name; and he hath made war with the Saints, and his power hath overcome them (marke) overcome them, and then himself hath reigned, and the reigne of Christ for many yeares hath not been known, but over kin∣dreds, and tongues, and Nations hath the Beast had power, and over them hath reigned for many ages, and all that dwell upon the earth hath worshiped him, whose names are not written in the book of life; the earth hath been caused, and them that dwell therein to worship the Beast, and by his won∣ders he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, and as many as would not worship the Beast and his image, the Beast hath had power that they should be killed, and many hath he kil∣led, who would not worship him, and are persecuted; and both small, and great, rich, and poor, free, and bond, hath re∣ceived the marke of the Beast, and the number of his name, which is the number of a man; he that reads let him under∣stand; these things hath come to passe, and been fulfilled since the Apostles dayes, in this night wherein no man could worke, which Christ said would come; but now the fourty, and two monthes, which time the Beast, and his image was to continue, and so long was his power to remaine to make war, and to overcome the Saints. I say the time is well nigh expired, and finished, and the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb is arisen to make war a∣gainst the Beast, and his image, who hath reigned over the Kingdomes of the world, and the judgment of the great whore cometh, who hath sit upon the Beast, and drunken the blood of the Saints, and with whom the Kings of the earth (since the Apostles dayes) have committed fornication, and all the inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication; and all the merchants of the earth hath been
made rich through the aboundance of her delicacies; and she hath sit upon the scarlet coloured Beast, and her cup in her hand hath been full of abominations, and filthinesse of her for∣nication, and her name is mistery Babylon, the mother of har∣lots; and all the Kings of the earth hath given their power unto the Beast, and committed fornication with the great whore; and she hath sit over people, and multitudes, and Nations, and tongues (since the Apostles dayes) and even some who have hated the whore, and fulfilled the will of God, and made the whore naked, yet they give their power also to the Beast, untill the word of God be fulfilled. Consider these things you that hath an ear to heare; but now the mighty day of the Lord, and the judgment of the whore is approaching, wherein she shall be rewarded accor∣ding to her works, and double shall be given her into her cup, and as she hath loved blood, so shall blood be given her to drinke, and the merchants of the earth shall lament her, whom they have waxen rich by, who hath glorified her selfe, and lived deliciously, and hath said in her heart, I sit as a Queene, and am no widow, and shall not see sorrow; but now the one day is dawning, wherein her plagues shall come, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall utterly be burned with fire; for strong is the Lord that is risen to judge her, and the Kings, and merchants, and all the inhabiters of the earth shall lament her, and shall cry, Alas, alas! and now are they beginning, for the hour is come that her judgment cometh, and all her merchants, who have trafiqued with the souls of men shall partake of her plagues, who have partaked of her sins, and lived deliciously with her, and the fruites that her soul lusted after shall depart from her, and all things that are dainty, and goodly, shall depart from her, and she shall find them no more at all, when her judgment cometh and in an hour all her riches is come to nought, and her merchants at land and Sea shall lament her; even her that hath ruled over Na∣tions, and sit as a Queene for many generations, ever since the dayes of the Apostles, untill this day; yea all that have wan∣dred after her, even the whole world shall lament, and bemoan her; and such as have served her, and made slaves of the souls
of men, by merchandize, and trafique shall bewaile her, and their gaine shall cease for ever, for in one hour shall she be made desolate, and her glory shall fade, and her beauty shall wither, and the Beast that hath carried her shall utterly faint, and the false prophet that hath wrought miracles in their sight, and deceived the Nations shall be cast into a bed of torment with her, and the Beast, and the false Prophet shall be taken, and cast alive into the Lake of fire to be tormented for ever day, and night, world without end; and the whore in whom hath been found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were slaine upon the earth, and the Beast who hath caused all that dwell on the earth to worship him, and his image, for many ages, and the false Prophet who hath de∣ceived the whole world, and all Nations, and made them sub∣ject unto the power of the Beast, by his miracles which he hath wrought in the sight of men; these shall be plagued to∣gether, and tormented together; for the false Prophet, and the Beast hath sent forth their uncleane spirits, like frogs unto all the Kings of the earth, and unto the whole world to ga∣ther them to battell with their Armies to make war against him that sits on the white horse, even the Son of God; and this is the false Prophet which Christ prohesied of to come, which long since came, and hath served the Beast, and the great whore; for many generations, and many even all Nati∣ons have been deceived as Christ said, and led aside▪ and blind∣ed, and bewitched by him; And as I have said these teachers of this generation are of them, of their Root, and off∣spring which long hath flourished on the face of the earth. But the day is at hand, that the heaven, and the holy Apo∣stles, and Prophets shall rejoyce over the whore, and over the false Prophet; for the Lord comes to avenge us on her, and as she hath done, so shall it be done unto her; now in this day wherein Jerusalem shall be builded againe, and the holy City which the Gentiles have trod under foot, for fourty and two monthes, which time is expired, and near a full end, ac∣counting from the dayes of the coming in of the Apostacy, un∣till this day, if any have an eare to heare let him heare; this I
have received from God; I say the holy City shall be measu∣red, and the Gentiles cast out, and she shall be adorned, and as a bride for her husband shall she be prepared, and Gods Ta∣bernacle shall be with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shll be his people, and God himselfe will be their God, and all teares shall be wiped away, and there shall be no more death, nor sorrow; for the former things are passed away and all things shall be made new. And what I have said are the faithfull sayings of God; e∣very one that is a thirst shall drink of the water of life freely, and he that overcometh shall inherit all things, and shall be called the Son of God, and shall dwell in the holy City, which long the Gentiles foot hath troden under, which shall againe be adorned, and prepared as a Bride for her husband; if any hath an ear to heare let them heare. And the glory of the Lord is risen, and his day is breaking forth more abundantly, and the Lambe is given for a light, and all Nations that are saved shall walke in the Light of the Lambe, and the King of righteousnesse, (who hath been long fled into Egypt, while Herod the Beast, which hath sought his life, and driven the woman into the wildernesse, hath reigned) shall againe be set upon the holy hill of Sion, and rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, and trample upon the necks of all his enemies, the Nations hath not for many ages been ruled by him. But the Beast, who hath ruled over kindreds, and people, and said who hath been able to make war against the Beast, and to the power of the Beast hath all Nations been subject, and the do∣minion of Christ hath been troden down, and despised, and his holy City hath been laid wast, and his Princely power hath not been felt, nor witnessed in the Kingdomes of men, for ages, and times, nor him the one head, and the one horne hath not been known, but many heads, and hornes hath been exalted, and all Nations, and all the Princes, and Kingdomes of the earth, hath been subject unto the Rule, and Law of the Beast, and to he divinations of the false Prophet, and darknesse hath been over all, and God hath been as a stranger in the earth, as one not known, he hath been worshiped ignorantly, and the inscription every where hath been to the unknown God, but
now after all this the glorious God of truth hath appeared, and great, and mighty hath been his hand, and power in this our day, in raising up a righteous branch out of the Root of righteousnesse, and in gathering his scattered people up to himselfe, who have been scattered by the Idoll teachers, and deceived by the false Prophets, and made a prey upon by the wilde Beasts of the Forrest; O how hath the people been made a prey upon by their teachers, and greedily devoured by dumb shepherds, who have sought themselves, and sought for their gaine, every one from his quarter; for many ages, how hath people been led blind, by their blind shepheards, and none to this day come to the knowledge of the truth by them? for these have run, and was not sent, and therefore the people have not been profited at all, as it was in Jeremiahs dayes, so is it now, no profit among people in the knowledge of the wayes of God, but leanesse, and barrennesse, and as the teacher, so his people, all out of the way, in prophanesse, and wickednesse, and prophanesse is gone forth from them into many Nations, yet is the Lord bringing backe his inheritance, which hath been driven away into the desolate wildernesse; yea, and the Lord hath caused his light to shine out of dark∣nesse, and unto them that have sit in darknesse, and in the shaddow of death is the marvellous light risen, that the glory of the Lord may be revealed, and Gods Tabernacle may be with men, and the holy City is a preparing as a bride for her husband, and darknesse shall fly away, and sorrow, and sigh∣ing shall no more be known, but life, and immortality shall a∣gaine be brought to light, as it was in the dayes of the Apo∣stles. This I have received from God; and the Lord shall be known to be the God of his people; and for this cause hath he called, and chosen faithfull witnesses, and given his power∣full ministry, by the gift of the holy Ghost, as it was in the A∣postles dayes, and now many are called to declare abroad the things which we have heard, and seen, and handled, and the Gospel of Christ is received by the Revelation of Gods eter∣nall Spirit, and Son in our hearts, and the power is made ma∣nifest, and the forme of godlinesse is denied and judged, and
Christ the one head is exalting, and the one horn of Gods sal∣vation is revealing, and the many heads, and many hornes must be broken to pieces, and be confounded in this the day of the Lord; for his purpose is powerfull in carrying on his own work against all his enemies; so that none is able to hinder, But they that set themselves (even the Beast, and his power. which is now struck at) and his Kingdome is invaded, hath raised the force of his power, and the policie of his arme; yet shall they be confounded, and no formed weapon shall pro∣sper against the Lord, and his way; who is now arisen to a∣venge himselfe of the Beast, and his power, and the whore, and her fornications, and the false Prophet, and his divinations, which all must into the wine-presse of Gods dreadfull wrath to be troden; and all that worship the Beast, and repents not, shall partake of the plagues of the Beast, and of the whore, and though the false Prophet gather Gog, and Magog toge∣ther, to fight against the Lamb, and to compasse the beloved. City about, yet he shall, and them that he gathers be broken to pieces, and driven as dust before the wind, and as stubble before the fire; for the purpose of the Lord shall stand. Great Babylon is come into remembrance before the Lord, to reward her according to her deeds; and the Lord will cause his truth, and his salvation to be known in the earth, and his name and power is declared in the hearts of his people to the overturning of all unrighteousnesse, and though every horn of the Beast push against this, and every head with his mem∣bers set it selfe against it; yet the councell of the Lord shall not be disanulled, nor made voyd, for the Scepter, and domi∣nion of his Son shall be exalted over all the earth, and the Princes of the world, and the Kings of the earth shall lay down their Crowns, and become subject; for the Kingdomes of this world shall be changed, and shall become the King∣domes of the Lord, and of his Christ; the Kingdome of the Beast must down, and the Princely power of darknesse must be overthrowne, and Lawes, and times, and things, and pow∣ers of men shall be overturned, and overturned, till he come to reigne in the earth, whose right it is to reigne over Nations, and people; And because of this the rage of the Heathen hath
been great, and the councells of the wicked many, and strong, from the prophane drunkards to the chiefest professed teachers of this age, even all the whole body of the Beast, hath joyned it selfe against the purpose of the Lord, men of all conditions from the highest to the lowest, have armed themselves with mischiefe to offend the way of truth. This is written as moved of the Lord to go abroad through the Nations, that all may understand concerning the times, and the changing of times, how that the Beast hath reigned in dominion, over Nations, tongues, and people; and all have worshiped the Beast, and gone after the false Prophet; here all may come to a good understanding, what hath been, and what is, and what shall be; how that when the power, and government of Christ was lost, through departing from the faith, which ruled in the Apostles dayes, then the whole world was as unstable in wayes, and judgments as a Sea, then out of the Sea one beast arose, and another after him arose out of the earth, and all hath been caused both small, and great, bond, and free to worship the beast, and the image of the Beast; yea all the dominions of the world hath for many ages been subject to the power of the Beast in all things, and not known the worship, and power of God, and the pure sub∣jection to him, but the Kings of the earth, and all her Princes have given their power to the Beast, and hath received their authority from him, and acted thereby many of them in great unrighteousnesse, in injustice, and oppression, and cruelty; in pride, and rebellion, and vaine glory, in quarilling one with another, to the murdering of thousands of thousands; and this hath all been brought forth under the power of the Beast, and by it; and his heads, and hornes hath exalted themselves one against another, and smitten one another, and the great whore hath made them all drunke, and all people upon earth, with envy, pride, wantonnesse, and all unrighteousnesse; this hath been since the Apostles dayes in this night of Apostacie, wherein the whole world hath been subverted by false Pro∣phets, and deceivers, and the Kingdome of Christ hath not been known upon earth for many generations, but the Beast hath been established in his Throne of rebellion against Christ
Jesus, his decrees hath been Lawes, and statutes, and he hath made war against all the Saints, and overcome them, and reigned over them untill this time, and troden down their Ci∣ty, and defaced their glory, but the blood of the just hath cry∣ed day, and night under the Altar, the soules of such as hath been slain for the Testimony of the word of God have cryed day, and night, how long Lord, how long, when wilt thou a∣venge our blood upon the heads of our enemies, even the Beast, the whore, and the false Prophet, and this hath been for many ages, even while the Kingdome of Antichrist hath been set up, and advanced through the world, and his power, and authority hath reached over Nations, bond, and free, from the Prince on his Throne, to the begger on the dunghill, even all hath been subjected under the power of the Beast; that nature having ruled within every particular, hath given him the authority without over all, and admired him, and said who is able to make war with him. Antichrist hath ruled over all, by injustice, oppression, and tyranny in unrighteous Lawes, and through wicked decrees, old Pharoah-like, he hath laid heavy yoakes, and oppressive bondes upon the just; for who would not be subject to him, he hath had power to kill them, and none was able to gainsay; such hath been the great∣nesse of his power, and the strength of his dominion over all, that none hath been able to make war against him, he hath been admired in all the world, not any Nation excepted where the government of Antichrist hath not borne rule, and there hath been none left to bear witnesse against him, or to stand up against him; for the faithfull witnesses hath been killed, and slain in the streets of the great City, which spiri∣tually is called Sodome and Egypt, and all them that have dwelt upon the earth have made merry over their dead bodies, and rejoyced in their iniquities over the slaine, and been with∣out a reprover, and not tormented, nor troubled, but have sent gifts one to another, because they have slain them, who have tormented them that dwell upon the earth; and the go∣vernment of the Beast hath been enlarged, and the whole world hath wandered after him, and been in subjection under him, for many generations; even for fourty and two monthes,
he that can read let him understand; so long hath it been gi∣ven him to make war against the Saints, and to overcome them, and it hath been given him to reigne over all people in the wrath of God, and in his anger, because of the rebellion of all the earth and all people in it, but he shall be taken away in Gods displeasure, who reignes in his anger over the Nations, who hath forsaken the Lord, and was given up to the power of the Beast, to be subjected in slavery, and bondage, in pain, sorrow, and misery; and through deceit, craft, and pollieic, and oppression, and by the wisdome of this world, and naturall artes, and knowledge his government hath long been establi∣shed, and his dominion hath been upon earth; times, and Lawes, and things, and powers of men have been in his hand, to change, and subvert, and overturne into his own image, and to transforme them like to the Beast, none upon earth, hath bought, or sold, or judged, or given evidence, or been respected in all the world, that have not had the marke of the Beast, and the number of the names of Antichrist, rich, and poor, and small, and great hath received his marke, as a seale of their subjection to the Beast, whose many heads, and many hornes, hath subjected all by the force of his arme, and he hath blinded the eye least men should see him, and cast dark∣nesse over all faces, and the salse Prophet hath deceived many, as Christ hath said, and all the earth hath been wandering in the wildernesse of wickednesse, and the long-suffering of the Lord hath been wearied, and he continually provoked to de∣stroy the Nations, who have followed Antichrist, who hath shewed himselfe in the seat of God, to be God, and hath sat in the seat of God, in the seat of justices righteousnesse, and of mercy, and the abomination of desolation hath long stood in the place where it ought not, for many ages, and length of times, and his many heads, and many hornes hath swayed the world, through the terrour of the Beast, who hath made all worship him, and they that would not he hath killed, who hath carried the great whore, who hath made all men without exception, and all Nations without respect to any, wholly drunke with abomination, and all hath staggered, and fallen▪ into grievous iniquities, and the Dragon hath stood ready con∣tinually,
to devour the child of righteousnesse as soon as it wa borne, and the woman hath been forced to fly into the wil∣dernesse that hath brought it forth, and hath fed there for so many dayes, and for a long season hath the Lord been blasphe∣med, even the name of God, and his Tabernacle; and them that dwell in heaven. But now hath the Lord considered, and looked down from his habitation, and of a truth he is risen, and hath taken to him his great power, that he may reigne, and put all things under his feet, and subdue the power of the Beast, and Antichrist; and all their government, and rule, and Lawes, and decrees shall be overthrowne, and confounded, and all their worship shall be broken; for great Babylon is come into remembrance before the Lord to render to her according to her workes; the Lamb is now risen, and advanced with his bow, and his sword, and he is going forth conquering, and to conquer the Beast, and all that hath worshiped him; and they that are with the Lambe are called and chosen, and faithfull, and they loved not their lives unto death, and they shall overcome him by the blood of the Lambe, and by the word of his Testimony; the dominion of the Lambe is setting up, and his power is made manifest, and the stone cut out of the Mountaine without hand is a dashing at the feet of the image, and against the Beast, and his power, and against all his Lawes, and decrees is he risen, and he will change times, and Lawes, and powers, and the Kingdomes of this world, shall become the Kingdome of the Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever; for now the Spirit of life from God is entered into the witnesses which hath been slain, and they begin to stand upon their feet, and great feare falls upon the great men of the world, and the Devill is cast out into the earth, who hath sit in heaven, in the Temple of God, and deceived the whole world, and his wrath is great against the Saints, and against the Lambe, because he knowes that his time is but short; and the man-childe shall grow, and shall rule the Nations with a rod of iron; if any man hath an eare to heare let him heare; he that leadeth into captivity, shall goe into captivity, he that killeth with the sword, must be killed with the sword; the
purpose of the Lord shall stand, who is now gathering, and bringing backe such as hath been driven away, and deceived by the generation of false Prophets, who hath deceived the whole world and all that dwell therein, and the Lord will take vengeance upon them, upon the Beast, and upon the false Pro∣phet, and great Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall be no more at all, but shall be made desolate, and the voyce of harpers, and musicians shall be heard no more at all in her, But her glory shall wither, and fade away in a moment, for he that bath a true weight, and measure is appeared to divide, and to give due weight, and measure unto every one, and all the wicked who will not come from under the worship of the Beast shall have their part in the Lake that burnes with fire, and he that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he that is righ∣teous, let him be righteous still, here is the dividing of all things as they were in the beginning; the glory of the Lord is risen, whose name is called the word of God, and out of his mouth goeth a sharpe sword, and with it he smites the Nati∣ons and he shall rule them with an iron rod; for his name is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and he is gathering his Saints together to the supper of the great God, to eat the flesh of Kings, the flesh of captaines, and the flesh of horses, and them that sit thereon; the purpose of the Lord shall not be disanulled, though the Beast, and the Kings of the earth ga∣ther together their Armies to make war against him that sits upon the horse, who is already gone out to conquer, and the numberles number of the Saints are gathering together be∣fore the Throne of the Lambe, and they have no guile found in their mouthes. And the day is now dawned, and the night is far spent, woe unto the world, and to all the inhabiters of the earth, who have worshiped the Beast, the Lord is coming to plead with you, and ye that have partaked of the sins of the great whore shall partake of her plagues, and she shall be rewarded double ac∣cording to her works, for her sins hath reached unto heaven; the day of great tribulation is at hand, of anguish, and de∣struction, men shall seek death and shall not find it, but it shall flie from them, when the Lord ariseth, and the Lamb standeth
upon mount Sion, and his Saints with him, who shall tread down the Heathen, and cast them out, even as they have tro∣den down the holy City, and the worship thereof; and the Kingdome of the Beast, and his seat, and his great authority, which he hath received from the Dragon, shall all be thrown downe; and the Kingdome of the Son of God with his go∣vernment, scepter, and rule shall be established in all the earth, and the uttermost parts thereof shall be given him to possesse; this is the promise, and this shall come to passe, and through the whole world; Lawes, and decrees, ministry, and orders shall be changed, and renewed; the Law, and the decree of the most high shall rule over all, and the holy City shall be beau∣tified, and is adorning, and preparing, for the Saints, and their King to inherit, the Lamb is the light of the City, and the Temple therein, and all Nations, and people that are saved shall walke in the light of the Lambe, for he hath lighted eve∣ry man that comes into the world with the light of salvation in all that doe receive him, and darknesse shall fly away; the Sun is risen, and praises, and honour, and glory, and domi∣nion shall be given to the Lambe, who shall reigne over Na∣tions, and his Saints shall see him, and his name shall be in their foreheads, and there shall be no night, but light, and glory, and the Kings of the earth shall bring in their glory, and honour into it, and the gates stand open, and is not shut, every one that thirsteth let him come, the cry is unto all, and yet nothing that defileth shall enter; these are the faithfull sayings of the Lord who is true, and must not long be sealed, for the time is at hand, and all men shall read, and all that keepeth the commandements of God shall have right to the tree of life, and blessed are they, they shall be healed, though now they suffer all manner of evill for the name of Jesus, by the Beast, and under his power, by them that worship him, who must fulfill wickednesse by persecuting the innocent, till the Lord be raised out of his habitation; and the dominion shall be given to them, and they shall have power to binde Kings in chaines, and nobles in fetters of iron; this is their honour, and this is their dignity, and they shall rejoyce for e∣ver, and ever, and shall glory in the Lord, and not in this
world, and this shall come to passe as the Lord hath said. Wherefore all Nations, and people arise, arise, and be awa∣kened, prepare, prepare, and make way for the Lord, be remo∣ved ye Mountaines, and thrown down ye hills, and hewen down ye sturdy oakes, and cut up ye tall Cedars, make way, and prepare the path for the holy one, who is coming to rule with his iron rod, and will dash you all to pieces; be afraid, and tremble thou Beast that hath long reigned over the earth, and all thy false Prophets, and worshipers be confounded at this, and bow, and tremble at the remembrance hereof, he whom you have hated, and crucified, and his Saints whom you have persecuted shall come to reigne over you all, and to him whom you have set at nought must you be subject to, and ruled by, to all your sorrow, for behold the Lord cometh with his numberlesse number of Saints, And this is a warning to all Nations, and people upon earth, times, and Lawes must be changed among you, governments, and orders must be changed; unjustice, and oppression shall be removed, and every yoake, and burden shall be taken of from the neck of the poor, true judgment, and justice, mercy, and truth, peace, and righteousnesse shall be exalted, and all the Nations shall have Judges as at the first, and counsellers as at the beginning, and the poor shall rejoyce when true judgment, and justice reigneth, and the false Prophet subdued. And this is a warning to you all, that you may hear, and consider the Lamb who hath been slain, who is risen to reigne, who is the Prince of peace, of whose government there shall be no end, even he hath lightned all man kinde on the face of the earth; the fight is the eye which will let you see all this, and will bring you to the fulfilling of it, and to the good un∣derstanding, and it shall evidence the truth of this, even the light of Christ in all men which is given to guide in the way of peace. THe Kingdome of Christ, is setting up, and it is not of this world, neither shall be exalted, nor advanced, by worldly pollicy, and worldly wisdome, nor by carnall weapons, nor by the multitude of an host of men, (it is true) the Son of
God is gone forth, conquering and to conquer, and the Spirit of his mouth, and the word of his power, shall get himself the victory his own arme, alone without the helpe of another, shall worke the conquest, and his Kingdome shall be set up within every particular of his subjects, for none can know him reigne without them unto their salvation, till they know him, to reigne first within, for that which opposeth the Kingdome of Christ, and the setting of it up, is within every man, and must be subdued within, where it hath ruled, and the ene∣my of Christs Kingdome, which hath lodged within, must first be subdued before there be dominion over his enemies with∣out. This is the word of the Lord to all people, for he that pursues his enemy without, and leaves him in his own house, is foolish, and out of the way, and shall be overcome of his e∣nemy, and shall not overcome him, therefore ye that are waiting for the Kingdome of Christ, be awakened, and seek for it, where it is to be found, not without you first, but first within, strive not to obtaine it with your carnall weapons, but take the weapons which is spiritual, which only will overcome, be not deceived for through suffering must the Kingdome of Christ be set up, and not by rebellion through crafts, and plots, and secret pollicy, and turbulent arisings, nor strife, in the nature of enmity, (by this meanes shall the Kingdome of Christ never be advanced) And this is the word of the Lord, and our Testimony which we give of the Kingdome of Christ, who is indeed arisen to make war against all his enemies, and they that follow him are called and faithfull, and chosen, whose weapons are spirituall, and mighty through God, and reacheth, to the killing and subduing of all flesh, (and he must war) till all his enemies be subdued, and must reigne over all his enemies, till the Kingdome be delivered to the Father, where he shall be all in all. The 3d month 1657.
All ye Inhabitants of the Earth in all Nations through the World; Hearken and give ear, the Word of the Lord God that made Heaven and earth is to∣wards you, He is coming to set up his King∣dome and his Dominion which never shall have end, and the Kingdomes of this world shall be changed and shall become the Kingdomes of the Son of God. ALl ye Kings, and Princes, and Rulers through the whole world, the Lord is coming up with his mighty Host against you all, he who will fanne you, and sift you, and try you, and search you out, for his fanne is in his hand, and he will throughly purge you, and you shall all know that the Kingdome of the most high God, rules in the Kingdomes of men; all your glory shall fade away, all your Majesty, and Honour, and Dignities, and Dominions shall come to an end, all your strength is but as a straw, all your treasure as a thing of nought, all your glory as a fading leafe in the presence of the Lord God that made heaven, and earth; all Nations up∣on the earth, are but as the drop of a bucket befoe him, and the hearts of all men are in his hand, and by him Kings rule, and the Princes of the earth are at his disposure and you are all weighed in the Ballance of equity, and found too light before the Lord, for all flesh hath corrupted its way before him; Be awakened ye that have long slept in darknesse, and been at ease in the flesh ye that have had peace in this world, and pleasure in the vanities thereof, the Lord is coming to make war against you, his trumpet hath sounded, and his Sons and Daughters is gone forth to bear witnesse of his Majesty, and Power, and Dominion, and the Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesie, he hath given the word, and many are they that publish it; Let your eares be open to instruction, and kicke not against the Lord, neither harden your hearts against him, but make way for him, and prepare his path, for he
cometh to judge the world in righteousnesse, and the people with equity, and the testimony of the light of Jesus in you all shall witnesse for him; your Princely powers must become subject to the power of the Kingdome of the most high, and your glory must be vailed, and darkned before the glory which the Lord is causeing to shine forth, and we the servants of the most high doe give you warning of the day of your visitation, which is upon you, and all the world; for the Lord is now risen who hath long winked at the time of great igno∣rance, but now he warnes you all to repent; therefore bow down ye stiffe-necked, and tremble ye stout-hearted, and be a∣based ye lofty-looks, our King is above you all, our dominion is over you all, and the line of true judgement are you all mea∣sured with, and your wayes are not found perfect in the sight of the Lord, nor your hearts right before him, his Kingdome hath not been known in your dominions, neither hath his Law and his Judgements borne rule, but you have every one bin doing that which is right in the sight of your own eyes; and the counsells of your heart hath been nought but va∣nity before the Lord; vain glory hath abounded among you which the Lords soul hath been burthened by; the honours, and pleasures of the flesh hath been your delight, and strife, and enmity hath been among you, and warres, and quarrel∣ling, and fighting one against another, and you have rejoyced in the over-throw one of another, and in destroying one ano∣ther, and you have taken pleasure in gaining one anothers do∣minions, you have striven who should have been the greatest, and greatly opressed the poor, you have exalted your selves one against another, and drawn up your Armies one in defi∣ance of another, and the Bloud of thousands hath been shed to satisfie the humors of your proud hearts all this hath been evill in the sight of the Lord, and his Spirit hath been grieved, and his soul vexed by all this, and he hath forborne till he hath been weary; for he hath been dishonoured by all this; and his Law hath not borne rule, and his judgements hath had no place, you have been cruell hearted one towards another, and mercilesse, and without pitty, and you have not done to others as you would be done unto, but you have ren∣dred
evill for evill, and sought occasions of evill one against another, and vexed one another through the pride of your hearts; Therefore now is the Lord risen to make warre against you all, and to dash you to peices; the feller comes up a∣mongst you, he that will not spare to ssay, and to devoure, who will not be affraid of your lofty lookes, he will spoile you of your treasures, and lay waste your strength; all ye kingdomes of the earth, and your gathering together against him is but as briers, and thornes, for he will exalt his owne Kingdome over you all, and all yee Kings of the earth shall know that that the Kingdome of the most high must rule in your Kingdomes, and your lawes shall be changed, and the poor shall no more be opressed; for he is come that proclaimes li∣berty unto the Captives, who will remove opression far away, who will change times, and worships and ordinances, and there shall be no Law but the Law of God, nor no light, but of the Lamb, nor no worship but the worship in the spirit, and in the truth; for all your worships which the nations are full of, is nought but vanity, and a lye, immitations, and super∣stitions, brought forth in hypocrisie, and not in an upright heart; vanity of vanities hath abounded both in civill, and spirituall affairs; The root in which you stand is wholy cor∣rupted, and no good fruit springs from it, but cursed fruites which must be hewen downe, and cast into the fire; ye have been evill, and could not bring forth any good, you are cor∣rupted, and your fruit is of a bitter taste, a day of sorrow, of lamentation, and misery is coming upon you all; ye that have been high, and lofty and stout hearted, fearfulnesse shall sur∣prize you, and the terror of the Lord of Hosts shall compasse you about; I am moved to salute you all with this as a war∣ning and when it comes to passe remember you have been told; ye that know not the kingdome of the most high ruling men, but are saying in your hearts this hath my hand done, in a moment shall you be smitten, and know there is one above you which must rule, for it his right to rule over all nations, and there shall be no King, but Jesus the anointed of God, nor no government, but the government of the Lambe, there shall be no more warres, but war against the Dragon, who hath
stood to devour the man-child, which is now bringing forth, and he must rule with his iron rod, and shall subdue all under his feet; We whom God hath warned cannot but warn you of these things, whith are to come to passe; he is coming to seperate betwixt the just, and the unjust, he will gather from among you, that the wicked may be consumed from off the face of the earth. All you Rulers in the world, I warne you all, take heed how you persecute such as comes to warne you, who brings this message to you, least you add sin to sin, till there be no place found for repentance; for ye shall all know our God is the true God that made heaven and earth, before whose pre∣sence all flesh must come to judgement. By a Friend unto the Creation. E. B. FINIS.
