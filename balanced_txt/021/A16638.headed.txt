¶ The shyppe of fooles. Gaudeam{us} oēs·
¶ Here after foloweth the prologue of the translatour of this present booke intytled the grete shyppe of fooles of this worlde. KNowynge that Melius est habundare {quam} defice∣re. It is better to haue haboundaunce of dyuers thynges than to haue necessyte. Wherfore I haue put myselfe to translate this presente booke called the grete shyppe of fooles out of Frensshe in to Englysshe / bycau¦se that this booke hathe ben fyrste made in Allemayne language / and out of Allemayne it was translated into latyn by mayster Jaques Locher / and oute of latyn in to rethoryke Frensshe. I haue consydered that the one delyteth them in latyn / ye other in Frensshe / some in ry∣me / and the other in prose / for the whiche cause I haue done this / more ouer consyderynge this that Therence Therentius. sayth. Tot capita tot sensus / also many heedes / also ma∣ny opynyons. And than consyderynge ye saynge of Uyr∣gyle Uirgilius. Trahit sua que{que} voluntas. Euery body wyll do af¦ter theyr voluntees / and wyll accomplysshe them / but as Uyrgyle sayeth more ouer. Nescia mens hoīm. The voluntees of men is vnknowen. Wherfore they yt wyll haue latyn take it / ye frensshe ryme or prose / or alleman or Englysshe. Who wyll haue ye morall sens take it / who that wyll haue the lytterall sens take it. And who wyll haue all take all as sayeth Esope. ¶ To the honour of ye Esopas. ryght hye and ryght sacred trynyte / fader / sone / and ho∣ly ghost in one essence / and of the ryght gloryous moder of god / and of all the sayntes of paradyse I haue begon to make this translacyon for to exhorte ye poore humay∣nes / the whiche by imbelycytes / & pusyllanimytes / haue ensued ye fooles of this presente worlde / & theyr werkes
And to the ende that they may eschewe al mondanytes and folyes / I praye them that they haue regarde vnto this present booke / and that they comprehende the sub∣staunce / to ye ende that they maye wysely gouerne them selfe in the tyme to come / and that thorugh theyr labour they may be of the nombre of ye saued. For whan a man debateth / the shame that it be not vaynquysshed multe plyeth his force. And the good conscyence also multeply eth vertues in man. Consyderynge also that the prose is more famylyer vnto euery man than ye ryme. I Henry Uirgilius. Watson indygne and symple of vnderstondynge / haue reduced this present boke in to our maternall tongue of Englysshe out of Frensh / at the request of my worshyp full mayster wynkyn de worde / thrughe the entysement & exhortacyon of ye excellent pryncesse Margarete / coū∣tesse of Rychemonde and Derby / and grandame vnto our moost naturell souerayne lorde kynge Henry ye. viii. whome Ihesu preserue from all encombraunce. If that I haue added ony thynge in ony place I haue not done it by arrogaunce / but for to applye vnto the scrypture. / and bycause that it came vnto purpose. I haue not wyl∣led to chaunge the name of the boke ye whiche hathe ben called by the fyrste composer the shyppe of fooles. He ha∣the fygured a shyppe full of fooles fletynge vpon a see / ¶ By the shyppe we may vnderstonde the folyes and er roures that the mondaynes are in / by the se this present worlde / the fooles beynge in the shyppe / is the synners / for we are in this worlde as pylgrymes fletynge frome one countree to another / and after our operacyons we shall be remunered at the porte of salute. Syth that it is so / we must serche in this booke the whiche may well be lled the doctrynall of fooles / for there may be foūden
good and helthfull doctrynes conteyned as well in the holy pagyne / as in the werkes of ye sayntes and prophe∣tes / of lawes and of the decretes of holy faders the whi¦che haue rowed so well in this worlde that they are ary∣ued at a good porte that is in the glorye eternall / to the whiche wyll conduyte vs the fader / the sone / and the ho¦ly ghost. amen. You lectours humbly I requyre you for to pardon me yf that I haue erred in ony thynge / for ye tendernes of my yeres hathe so affusked me that I ha∣ue not applyed me vnto the lettres as Jought to haue done / the language is not autentyke / to the ende that e∣uerybody may vnderstonde some thynge / for folkes vn lyttered demaundeth not thynges obscure. ¶ Prolude of this present boke. NOwe is the worlde ful of scyence and docu¦mentes made by our aūcyent faders / in su∣che wyse that the holy scrypture is in gret∣ter vygoure than euer it was / for in her is all ryght. Fyrst we haue the holy byble of ye aūcyent faders. In ye whiche appereth euydently theyr feates and lyues / we maye take good ensamples for to susteyne and nourysshe our poore soules. For he that lo∣ueth not vertues is reputed vyle. More ouer we haue ye bookes of phylosophye wherin is conteyned all goodnes it is they wherin all the wyse men dyd lerne / she is excel∣lente and of grete pryse. And who that delyteth in her may haue ryght grete prouffyte. But this notwithston∣dynge I meruayle me of euery mortall man / bycause yt they thynke not vpon theyr salute / and thynke soner to assemble a grete sorte of synnes / and how that god con∣sumeth
vs not / seynge yt we offende hȳ soo moche. Good doctryne is chaced out of the worlde euery daye / and in folye and imbelycyte man passeth his dayes / he fleeth & leueth good doctryne. Palas was wonte to kepe the ren Pals. ges in this worlde / but by our grete and enorme synnes we maye not suffre it. She is in heuen where as she ser∣ueth the sayntes of whome she is loue. None or ryght fewe haue her prudence / scyence / or doctryne / we haue not the ouerture of probyte / fayth / conscience / loue / and pyte is not in vs / but echone dysprayseth his god / wher fore he yt taketh vertues / cheseth a good place. Noneste thynges and good condycyons we dysprayse. The holy sayntes documentes and admonestinges we dyspyse wt the celestyall doctrynes so dulcet and amerous vnto the good and dyscrete men of this worlde. ¶ More ouer we fall in infynyte errours that in the worlde is the worste and are releued in a myscheuous empyre / by our synnes are infynyte / and none of vs hathe a stedfaste degree. By playnes / wayes / pathes / tauernes / markettes / stre∣tes / mountaynes / hylles / felde s / and fynably by al quar¦ters is excercysed glotonye whiche is so vyle / in takyng inutyle wayes / and not the waye of salute. We folowe capons / tauernes / etynge & drynkynge insacyably / we replenysshe our bodyes vnmesurably with lecherye and delycates / sobrenes is not foūde in vs / euery body is tro¦bled with this vyce. Our hertes is affusked so that it de∣maundeth nothynge but vanytees / our soules we fulfyl with fylthes and lecheryes in lyke wyse / and of othervy¦ces mo than a hondred. By the meanes wherof there is grete haboundaunce of fooles thorugh the worlde / in su¦che wyse that in dyuers regyons and countrees theyr fo¦lyes redoundeth / so moche that all vertues & pure thyn∣ges
contamyne and dysprayse by theyr folye Some we neth to be ryght wyse and dyscrete / ye whiche knoweth neyther ryght ciuile nor canon / and by this moyen they are alwayes fooles. Suche folkes ought not to be byle∣ued that are so ouer wenynge and vnknowynge / for of∣tentymes they are taken for good and is al replete with vaynglorye / of good wyt they are voyde and yet they re¦pute themselfe prudent and wyse. Now then the good and loyall shall haue theyr deserte and hyre. And fooles peruers shall be vnwryten. Wherfore I wyll gyue eue∣ry body good loos after my possybylyte and the deserte of echone. By my fyccyons I shall dresse vpon ye se shyp¦pes and barges / and shall furnysshe theym with cordes and toppe castelles verges and sayls / ores and botes / in grete multytude. And shal take them in dyuers coun¦trees where as all the humaynes shall reygne good and euyl / blynde / seke / and hole / and with my propre handes shall ordre them without cessynge also longe as . It is also well necessarye for me / for there is o  les innumerable that do infynyte euylles / whome I  not wryte all in this present booke. These fooles re vnto our shyppes moche impetuously / in suche wye yt they hurte theyr fete and legges for ha to come vntyll our shyppe. Whan I thynke on theyr molestacyons / & theyr mestimable folyes with theyr grete euylles / there is mo of them than a grete company of hony bees eyn∣ge in the feldes vpon the odyfferent floures. And bryefli there is so many folysshe erroures a brode that our shyp is almoost all replete with them. Of these fooles some is prentyses & wyll haue the gouernynge after theyr wyl∣les / many ye shall se dyscerne / and eche saynge I wyl go¦uerne all / bothe maste / sayll / Some wyll be byneth in y•
shyppe / the whiche hathe but lytel delyte whan he hathe sene the peryll so daungerous / but there is fewe that ha∣the this fere / and yet they haue passed thrughe oute my shyppe. The last of these rennynge fooles wyll be aboue the other / and wyll drawe vp the sayll on lofte / to the en¦de that it may entre more in to the see. If that you wyll knowe what is this shyppe / knowe that eche of vs hath a shyppe / but yet there is one the whiche is comune / and all fooles / that hathe dyuers hunes and toppes / & goche in to dyuers countrees / the whiche is replete with ma∣ny sortes of fooles. O you reygnynge that haue fayre fa¦ces / myrre you here and red? this present booke / for the∣re is not an humayne but that he maye se his fourme in this booke. If that you entende totally vnto my doctry nes / be you well sure that you maye acquyre the glorye eternel / and eschewe the pardurable paynes of helle / for you shall haue fruyte of vertues & benedyccyon of god. folye shall not go and fetche you / and our shyppe ye wol de not seke / but ye may acquyre the glorye pardurable / you shal go the waye that all the crysten men watche / & shal acquyre vertues and holynes / puttynge all euyl vy ces oute of you. Consyder humayne folkes and mortall men the feates and the desyres mondaynes / and ye shal knowe that the moost strongest / the moost wysest / & the moost valyauntest go rennynge more swyfter than the hynde / and theyr trace is not knowen. Alas oure lyues passeth ryght sone. He that is poore and hathe nothynge is holden for a foole / that parauenture is without sȳne / Alas he is more wyser than they yt haue moche goodes / and be in the subgeccyon of the deuyll. And he is holden for ryght wyse that hathe haboundaunce of goodes / & he is so replete with synne that it is a thynge inestyma∣ble
/ ye so moche that thrugh his offence he is casten in to the fyre of helle / wyse is he not but a parfyte foole. The poore that is reputed for a foole at his aste ende loketh to be partycypar of the goodes of dame palas. They yt loue vertues without doynge outrage to ony body / god shall loue them without ony faute / so that he bere not a folysshe mytre / and yf he were of scyence vnpuruayed / So that he be replete with vertue / he shall be more wy∣ser than a grete clerke. ¶ I fynde assembles of fooles by grete hepes and routes of dyuers nacyons and maners for the one is vnbraynles that wyll bere baners. The o∣ther is of fyers thoughtes the whiche dothe not enploye them but alonely to assemble rychesses. And bryefly for to knowe whiche is the fooles I shall name theym here vnto you. Nobles / clerkes / preestes / monkes / apostates burgeyses / marchauntes / ryche / poore / & of all craftes / is our shyppe almoost full. There is neyther rustyke / ol∣de / yonge / berdles / stronge / feble / grete / nor lytell haue they neuer so moche scyence. yf they be fooles they haue no respyte but that they come hastely in to our shyppe / Not alonely the men / but also the women / ladyes / gen∣tylwomen / burgeyses / olde and yonge / dronkerdes / & so¦bre / pudykes / chaste / wedowes / and maryed women be in our shyppes with the men / for in dyuers thynges me ueth dyuers folkes / and pryncypally in voluptuous lo∣ue / in suche wyse that they leue all good operacyons for to lyue in carnall felycyte and lubryke lyfe. Mondayne fooles myrre you well in my glasse / and you shal se your fautes and synnes. And shall knowe euydently how fo∣ly dothe gouerne you. Knowe that our entencion preten deth to none other thynge saue that we may make satys¦faccyon vnto god / to the ende that we be full of vertues
for to leue our shyppe and mast / & our importable dys∣corde / leue synne / and go out of the myre / for it is yt whi∣che putteth the soule to dethe / do it sone and I shal be of youre accorde. If that some fooles mocke vs bycause of our lytell wrytynges / and that there is comprehended dyuers fooles in it / they haue small vnderstondynges / for the sens lytterall is not the substaunce of the mater. Suche folkes is lyke them that thynke for to ete the al∣mondes kyrnelles withoute brekynge of the stones / for who that wyll fynde sauour therin muste breke it / also who wyll fynde prouffyte in this booke / oughte to reste hym on the moral sens that is couered with foly. My bo¦ke satyryke I gyue vnto you for example. Lordes yf it please you for to rede it / & yf it seme you yt it is mordaunt excuse me as the auncyentes are excused / the whiche ha∣ue made dyuers fayre doctrynes mordauntes. The poe¦tes haue also compyled dyuers noble bookes correckyn∣ge the vyces of the humaynes. ¶ All this consydered I wyll folowe them / notwithstondynge yt I am not wor∣thy. But yet in maner of passe tyme I wyll speke here of fooles men and women / and assygne them guaryson of vertues / scyence / & doctryne / for to make them condys∣cende vnto goodnes. For I had neuer other wyll but for to detraye yonge bachelers out of synnes and vyces / & to conduyte them vnto the porte of reason and vertue / Pardon me you oratours yf ony thȳge be euyll couched and you lectours that occupyeth the tyme in this lecture yf you fynde ony faute / please it you to excuse the capa∣cyte of me / & the yongthe that I am yet in / consyderȳge that there is none so well shodde but that they may slyde somtyme. ¶ Hereafter foloweth the table.

¶ Argument in the shyppe of Fooles of this Worlde. FOr the felycyte and salute of all the humayne gendre is compyled and dyrecte the shyppe of fooles of this transytory worlde / in the whiche as∣cendeth all they that vageth from ye waye of trouthe / and from the play∣ne exhortacyon of ye intellectyue vn∣derstondynge in transmutable and obscure thoughtes of ye frayle body. Wherfore this pre∣sent boke may be called satyre / notwithstondynge that the fyrste auctoure dyde delyte hym in the newe intytu∣lacyon of this present booke / for ryght so as by the poe∣syes and fyccyons / the auncyent poetes dyde correcte ye vyces and fragylytees of mortall men. ¶ Semblably this present pagyne specifyeth before theyr syght the es∣tate and condycyon of men / to the ende that as a myr∣roure they beholde the meurs and rectytude of lyfe. Ne¦uertheles thynke not ye lectours that I haue worde by worde dyrecte and reduced this presente booke oute of Frensshe in to our maternall tongue of Englysshe / for I haue onely (as resyteth Flaccus) taken entyerely the substaunce of the scrypture / in esperaunce that myn au¦dace presumptuous sholde be pardonned of the lectou∣res / hauynge aspecte vnto ye capacyte of my tendre ye¦res / and the imbylycyte of my lytel vnderstondynge / in leuynge the egressyons poetyques and fabulous obscur¦tees / in achyeuynge the werke in facyle sentence and fa¦mylyer style / in supplyenge al the reders to haue me for¦
excused yf that I have fayled in ony thynge. ¶ Here after ensueth the fyrste chapytre. ¶ Of bookes inutyle. ca. primo. ¶ The fyrste foole of the shyppe I am certayne That with my handes dresse the sayles all For to haue bookes I do all my besy payne Whiche I loue not to rede in specyall Nor them to se also in generall Wherfore it is a prouerbe all aboute Suche thynketh to knowe yt standeth in doute
YOnge folkes that entende for to knowe dy¦uers thȳges approche you vnto this doctry¦ne & it reuolue in your myndes organykes / to the ende that ye maye comprehende and vnderstande the substaunce of it / and that ye be not of the nombre of ye fooles that vageth in this tempesteous flode of the worlde. And you also the whi∣che haue passed the flourynge aege of your youthe / to ye ende that and ye be of the nombre of the fooles moun∣daynes that ye maye lerne somwhat for to detraye you out of the shyp stultyfere. Wherfore vnderstande what the fyrste foole sayth beynge in the grete shyppe of foo∣les. ¶ I am the fyrste in the shyppe vagaunte with the other fooles. I tourne and hyse the cordes of the shyp saylynge ferre forth in the see. I am founded full euyll in wytte & in reason. I am a grete foole for to affye me in a grete multytude of bokes. I desyre alwaye and ap∣petyteth newe inuencyons compyled mystycally / and newe bookes / in the whiche I can not comprehende the substaunce / nor vnderstande nothynge. But I doo my besy cure for to kepe them honestly from poudre & dust. I make my lectrons and my deskes clene ryght often. My mansyon is all replenysshed with bookes / I solace me ryght of ten for to se them open without ony thynge compylynge out of them. ¶ Ptolomeus was a ryche Ptolomeus. philadelph{us}. cui{us} memini. Josephus. si. xii. man the whiche constytued and commaūded that they sholde serche hym thorough euery regyon of the worlde the moost excellentest bookes that myght be founden / And whan they had brought them all / he kepte theym for a greate treasoure. And that notwithstandynge he ensued not ye ensygnementes nor ye doctryne of the dy∣uyne sapyence / how be it that he coude dyspose nothyn∣ge
of the lyfe without it / what bookes someuer he had / nor compose ony thynge to the relefe of his body at that tyme. I haue redde in dyuers bookes / in the whiche I haue studyed but a lytell whyle / but oftentymes I ha∣ue passed the tyme in beholdynge the dyuersytees of the couerynges of my bookes. It sholde be grete foly to me to applye by excessyue studye myn vnderstondynge vn¦to so many dyuers thynges / where through I myghte lese my sensual intellygence / for he that procureth for to knowe ouermoche / and occupyeth hymself by excessyue studye / is in daunger for to be extraught from hymself also euerychone is dyspensed / be he a clerke or vnderstō∣de he nothyng yet he bereth the name of a lorde. I may aswell commytte one in my place the whiche thynketh for to lerne scyence for hym and for me. And yf that I fynde myselfe in ony place in the company of wyse men to the ende that I speke no latyn / I shall condyscende vnto all theyr preposycyons for fere that I sholde not be reproched of that that I haue so euylly lerned. ¶ O Prouerb. v. doctours the whiche bereth the name and can nothynge of scyence / for to eschewe grete dyshonoure come ne in the company of lerned men / our auncyent faders he¦re before dyde not lerne theyr resplendysshynge scyence in the multytude of bookes / but of an ardaunt desyre & of a good courage. They had not theyr spyrytes so vn∣stedfast as ye clerkes haue at this present tyme / it were more propyce for suche folkes for to bere asses eeres / than for to bere the names of doctours and can nothyn¦ge of cunnynge. ¶ Of good counsayll. ca. secundo.
¶ The counsayll the whiche dothe not well conserne His owne estate and grete affynyte And from others hurte dothe not his dyscerne Is well worthy to haue aduersyte Prouerb. v And to be deiecte from prosperyte For he bryngeth the hogge vnto the pyt And afterwarde reuerseth hym in it HEre after ensueth of them that wyll haue entre in to the senate / or in the courte of so∣me grete lorde or prynce / to the ende that they maye haue honoure and reuerence of the people in theyr countree / and to be exal¦ted before the other / and it is they the whiche ben ye leest Ecclesia. ii. experte in scyences / as in lawe / & decrete / and good coū∣sell
by suche folkes is obscurely couerde and hyd in vay∣ne wordes / and walketh by tenebrous centres. At rome auncyently were good coūsayllers / wyse / prudent / and lettered / the whiche canonykely and imperyally punys∣shed the malefactours / and thynges yllycyte and vycy∣ously done And the thynges that were good and honest they mayntened in multyplyenge from daye to daye ye tranquylyte and welfare of ye thynges publyke. But at ene. this present tyme in many places be some coūsellers & gouernours of courtes / as well seculers as ecclesyasty∣kes that can not eschewe some euyll passage / nor dyscer∣be the lytyges and debates / nor vnbynde the knotte yt is bounden. Yf that a presydent requyre hym for to gy∣ue lib. ii. ff. de ori¦gi. . hym some good counsayll vpon some defuse mater / he is so full of pryde and grauyte that he wyll not decla∣re vnto hym no newe thynge / also it sholde be agaynst reason for to make pure and clene water yssue out of a vessell the whiche is maculate & fulsome. He fleeth from the other / and semeth that he wyll not saye neuer a wor¦de vnto theyr preposycyons / but he wyll not in noo ma∣ner of wyse gaynsaye them for fere lest they sholde dys∣prayse hym bycause of his vnreasonnable responce and vnconnynge / and in this maner of wyse is the counsell corrumped / lo how suche folke do Justyce the whiche de¦pendeth vpon them. Alas senate & courte royall / what forfayture / what euyll nature / what greuous euylles ys sueth from the that ought to be moder and nouryssher of Justyce. Knowest thou not how that thy propre coū∣sayllers assemble them togyder whan there is ony ver∣dyte or sentence to be gyuen / and yf that there be tway∣ne of one semblable oppynyon / the other wyl not empes¦she the sentence be it egall or not and so lettteth it passe /
and by this reporte vniust the courte shall execute false Judgement. Alas it is not ynoughe for to here the other ii. q. iii.  tempus. nor for to ensue theyr oppynyons. ye must recyte and de¦clare good auctorytees of lawe and of decrete / reuolue ye must the forsayd lawe in your myndes ententyfly / & her vpon examyne eche partye and after gyue the sen¦tence / to the ende that he whiche thou wylte Juge accu∣e the not before the grete Juge of heuen of false Juge∣ment.

¶ Of auaryce and prodygalyte. ca. iii. ¶ Of the folysshe shyppe there dothe occupye The seconde parte the auarycyous That wyll not gyue a poore man one peny He is so harde and so malycyous Beynge on his rychesse so curyous That is lente hym but for a small ceason The poore at nede to defende by reason ALl theym the whiche assembleth golde and syluer by grete foyson / ben repreued as is this poore foole the whiche gadereth golde & syluer and grete fynaunce / and of his goo∣des Psal. xxvii. taketh no solace / whan he hathe gade∣red
grete plente / and deyeth. Alas he bereth nothynge Ecclesia. v. ps. xviii. with hym / he leueth his treasour and fynaunce vnto his chyldren neuewes or kynnesmen / the whiche after his dethe maketh grete chere with it / they dysprybute it in C. de cura. fur. l. i. pompous araye / and in voluptuous dylectacyons car∣nalle to theyr grete dystruccyon of body and soule / & all for the goodes that the deed body had assembled in grete thought and calamyte / the whiche parauenture is in the obscure pyt of helle in grete mysery and extyn∣guysshyble tormente. It had ben more expedyente for hym to haue ben satysfyed with a lytell / for all that the whiche he hathe assembled togyder prouffyteth hym no∣thynge / but he must endure payne / anguysshe / & cruel rage / and of the drynke of Acherons floode infernall in fecte and stynkynge his body is replenysshed with. Yet I fynde a gretter euyll of ye Prodygue that dyspendeth all his propre goodes in excesse and wast / and can not prouyde a remedy therfore. ¶ Suche folkes ben deiecte from al good meurs and condycyons / and ben replenys¦shed with all vyces / to the dyscrete men cometh ye good. for the prodygues and vycyous wyll none therof. ¶ Be they not then redotynge fooles that assemble soo moche rychesse / and purchaseth not the salute of theyr soules. Alas louest thou better for to suffre payne inestymable with all the deuylles of helle / than leue thyne insacyate desyre of gaderynge of rychesse / thy goodes can not aled¦ge the of thy payne / of them thou can not be comforted but shall bewrappe the in the moost profoundnes of the extynguysshyble pyt infernal. And that worse is / yf thȳ enherytours myght by the for a peny / with grete payne wolde they do it / for yf thou were in this worlde it were behouefull for the to rendre thy goodes agayne. I may
name vnto the Tantalus the whiche is in the goulfre Tantalus de quo lactātius of helle / he enrageth for hūgre and thurst / and is in the water vnto ye chynne / but whan he thynketh for to drin¦ke it aualeth so lowe that he can not drynke of it. And there is also a pere tree besyde hym vpon the whiche pe∣re tree is a pere that toucheth almoost his nose / & whan he stratcheth hymselfe vp for to catche it / the tree ryseth vp / and in this maner of wyse he enrageth for hungre and thurst. Consyder what torment it is / it were better for the auarycyous to gyue all his goodes / than for too be in suche a torment remaynynge there perdurably. Wherfore I supply and beseche all the auarycyous mē in the name of our lorde Ihesu cryst that wolde dye for our sake vpon the tree of the crosse / that ye molefy your hertes / and that ye do almesdedes durynge this transy∣tory lyfe / for after that ye be ones departed out of thys worlde your goodes and rychesse can not helpe you in no wyse. ¶ And yf soo be that ye lyue well and egally in this vale of myserye / ye shall purchase and acquyre the glorye eternell. Rede this that Tullyus resyteth here sa∣yenge Tullius in paradoxis. that neuer wyse man wolde regne in this worlde puyssauntly / but with good herte & moderate thoughte demaunded pacyence / pease and sapyence / and to flee & eschewe pleasure moundaynes / for the wyse man maye well do it. Of the ordures moūdaynes we haue wryten in the decretalles how Crassus desyred for to haue a gre¦te i. q. i. {quod} q̄dem l. crassus. somme of golde and syluer the whiche he obteyned / and had grete haboundaunce. It befell within a shorte tyme after that he was nprysoned by the Parthes / and all was for bycause of his treasour. Resemble al vnto so crates the whiche sayd that rychesse was enemy vnto scyence / moyennynge of (which) he that had so moche ry¦chesse / threwe
all his goodes in to the see / in suche wyse that no body coude blame hym. ¶ Poore moundaynes thynke well vpon this that I haue rehersed to you / for truely there is manere in euery thynge / for the happy & eurous helde the hye waye. ¶ Of newe guyses & customes. ca. iiii. ¶ He that desyreth euer thynges newe For to begynne amonge the poore men all Parauenture he maye it ones sore rewe Whan he cometh before god eternall There to be Juged in sentence fynall Where after his deserte he shall haue mede yf he haue done well he shall ryght well spede
EUery body ought for to gouerne them after the auncyentes and good customes / but that whiche was of olde antyquyte vycyous / cry∣mynell / and dyshonest / is at this present ty∣me taken for honeste by newe vsages / newe customes haue al the bruyte at this tyme amonge dyuer¦se folkes. I can not well conspyre in my herte the which is the moost foole of them twayne that vse the olde or ye newe customes / or he the whiche wereth grete sleues wt Math. xviii. grete bordures / or they the whiche bereth large sleues / Saue that me thynketh it is all one thynge / and that ye one is as folysshe as the other. For he thynketh that ha∣the the bordured sleues that he is as honestly clothed / as he the whiche hathe the large sleues. Amonge the auncy ente faders it was a grete loouynge and praysynge for to haue longe berdes / that custome sholde be ryght fo∣lysshe and straunge vnto vs at this present tyme. So∣crates ii. regum. x. the whiche was a grete phylosophre began fyrste for to bere a berde / and after hym all the other phyloso∣phres toke that custome. ¶ After that the good phyloso¦phers were departed out of this worlde / fragylyte and luxury dyde sprede all aboute the worlde / in suche wyse that almoost it floryssheth amonge all synnes. All ye ver¦tues wherwith the hye elementes ben decored and aour¦ned / ben all vyces and synnes in a casualte through the worlde. All the humaynes wyll counterfet that whiche our lorde hathe create / and by theyr presumpcyon thyn∣keth to do better than god. O what erroure / what abo∣mynable synne. Some bereth grete berdes for fere that they seme not more auncyent. They araye theyr bodyes Sicambri. Ethiopes. and vysages in suche a facion that they seme yonge / but yet they be olde. The other bereth theyr heere as Syca∣bryens / or
longe / yelowe and trussed lyke Almaynes / or as Ethyopiens cryspe and corled / the whiche is combed ten tymes a daye. Some hathe theyr habytes so shorte that one maye almoost se theyr ars. There, be some that haue theyr neckes all charged with grete chaynes / and ben all replenysshed with golden Jewelles / theyr han∣des full of gemmes and rynges. Ample bonettes with lowe neckes / and garded lyke as it were for dyspyte / & therupon the small hattes that is set all vpon one syde / Theyr gownes shorte full of playtes / and the sleues lar¦ge as a sacke. Theyr doublettes is garded endlong and ouerth warte bordred wt veluet or wt sylke. Clokes ben∣ded with dyuers colours. There is dyuers clothes wor¦ne at this present tyme / the gownes haue double rebra∣ced colers. Theyr shertes ben fronced with golde or syl∣ke / ye & that is of the fynest clothe yt can be founden. It is the guyse of the infideles / of the turkes and sarazyns vyle and abhomynable. The grete shone rounde as a boule / and after them the squared / buskynges all to cut slyppers bygared / the hosen garded and bended with veluet or satyn / the purses as sachelles / with gyrdylles of taffeta. What lacketh there more (nothynge) saue the fayre swerde or hanger by theyr syde. O crystendome crystendome / yf thou haue mortalytes and epydemees thou arte the cause therof. I saye and notefye to the / yt yu haste endured that suche habytes haue ben worne / & that worse is / is yet worne. Thou shalt haue yet dyuers punycyons / yf in shorte tyme thou remedy it not. Cast awaye these newe guyses and customes / aswel men as women: for they be vyle and dyshonest. Mayst thou not well thynke that the sauyour of all the worlde shall Ju∣ge all ye humaynes / & of the mysdedes wyll reuenge hȳ.
¶ Of auncyent fooles. ca. v. ¶ Alas for all that euer I enclyne To my sepulture bothe by houre and daye yet can I not leue the folysshe ruyne That I haue contynued in alwaye And of olde fooles euer hathe kepte the laye Wherfore of olde fooles I maye be the chefe For all that is vyce hathe ben to me lefe
AWaken your spyrytes auncyent folkes / the whiche haue ben fooles all your lyfe / & her∣ken how that this olde foole maketh his cō∣playnte. The grete foly ryght vycyous and replenysshed with bytternes that hath euer remayned in me syth myn enfancye / may not suffre that I leue myne auncyent custome and fyrste lyfe. I am a chylde / & yet ye maye se that I can not go. I haue a. C. yere and more & yet I am no wyser than I was wonte to be. I am almoost as prudent and wyse as I was at my byrthe. And that worse is I wolde be no wyser / the sygnes and tokens of fooles I shewe and mynyster to chyldren / and I wryte the folysshe regyme of foly. I ha¦ue made my testament the whiche conteyneth & techeth doctryne vnto all them that wyll folowe me and lyue fo¦lysshely as I haue done. I am the ryght euyll and luna Esaye. xvi. tyke conductour and leder of all the other fooles that ha¦ue ensued and folowed my doctryne / and am toure of all vyces and euyll examples / and that whiche I ler∣ned I shewe it nowe by experyence. Myn innocent de∣des c. ex sludits. specyfyeth that I am a foole / for of my foly I desy∣re to haue louynge and praysynge. In euery place whe∣reas I go I may well gyue them knowlege that I ha∣ue sowen euyll renowne in dyuers places and countres c. cum tu te. de presum And by my folyshnes vyle and  demonstraunce of my vyce and synne / my foly and my dyshonour / and me thynketh it is grete honoure of . M¦legyōs of euylles hathe ben sowen vpon the erth by me I haue my herte ryght sorowfull that I maye oo more so. I haue grete dyspyre that I may not consume my clothes vnto an ende that none myght were them after me / but syth that I am olde & auncyent & may no
more regne / I wyll lerne my chyldren and neuewes to do as I haue done faynynge that of vyces the waye is ryght ample in euery place. Lo how the fader gyueth e∣uyll example vnto his chyldren and neuewes / the whi∣che becometh more vycyous and peruers by halfe than is the fader / of the whiche he is gretely reioysed / & wol∣de be ryght angrye to here saye that his chyldren were benygne. In dule and melancoly the chyldren shall fy∣nysshe De consecra ti. di. v. c. vl. in glosa. theyr lyues / sythe that they lyue soo vycyously. Wherfore I saye that he is worthy for to gouerne oure shyp whan there cometh ony tormente. Alas olde foole wherfore hast thou no shame yt thy foly hathe surmoun∣ted the so longe. Hast thou no remors of conscyence for to lyue so longe in vyle synne abhomynable. Knowest yu not that the euyll the whiche is rooted can not be taken awaye afterwarde / for whan one abydeth to longe for Daniel. xiiii. to remedye his causes / with grete payne may he detray the meurs that ben roted in the herte. ¶ Of the documente of chyldren. ca. vi. ¶ He that forgyueth the crymes ryght vycyous Of his chyldren withouten correctynge And them enduceth not in vertues gloryous Is well worthy to haue grete tormentynge And the anguysshe by longe contynuynge For why he seketh all the wayes he can To lyue in sorowe as a folysshe man.
YOnge chyldren the whiche desyreth to lyue well and ryghtwysly / reste you and herken to my doctrynes / and you also faders that haue chyldren in your puyssaunce. The fa∣der shall be alwaye myserable / and gretely affusked that hathe not some aspecte vnto his chyldren. and that dothe not payne and solycytude for to reduce them vnto vertuous operacions / ferynge the dethe that cometh vpon them for theyr werkes vnresonable and mortall. He is also a fole detestable and manyfest that seeth his chyldren do euyll and careth not therfore. Alas it is not well consydered of you for to suffre youthe vo∣luptuous to renne euery where withouten conductour. or gouernoure. For whan a flocke of shepe ben without a pastour / they leue theyr hye waye in errynge and stra¦yenge
by the feldes and playnes / in suche wyse that of∣tentymes the wulfe cometh and deuoureth them. And in lyke wyse is it of yonge chyldren that resorteth vnto vycyous places who so dothe comprehende it well. ¶ O folysshe fader more vnreasonable than a dombe beest / for whan one accuseth his chyldren of some trespace / he excuseth them: saynge that it is youthe / and that they ha¦ue no reason / and that they know not whether they doo well or euyll. O poore fooles they do well / theyr youthe can not excuse them. Knowest thou not thou blynde fa∣der that sapyence groweth in tender meurs / and dyspo∣seth ye lycoure and doctryne of holy lyfe. Knowest thou not that sapyence adresseth sooner vnto yonge folkes / than vnto olde / for they retayne it better in theyr vnder stondyng than they that ben fallen in aege. Orace sayth that and one take a newe erthen pot and put swete smel Oracius. lynge floures therin / it shall smell euer after of that sa∣me loures / but & ye put stynkynge thynge in it / it shall haue euer after stynkynge odoure. Take ensample also of a yonge tree / for one maye bowe it in eche manere of wyse / but whan the tree is grete and stronge one maye not bowe it without brekynge. Wherfore faders endoc∣tryne your chyldren in theyr florysshynge youthe / for ve retably swete correccyon and dyscyplyne / enduceth yon ge chyldre vnto all vertues / & causeth them to eschewe vyces. We rede of kynge Pryam that accorded vnto ye Priamus. Troyanus. wyll of his chyldren / wherfore the grete cyte of Troye was oppressed by the Grekes / and fynably this kynge Pryam sawe all the cyte destroyed thrughe his consen∣tynge to the wyll of Parys that in Grece auyshed and brought awaye the fayre Helayne. And more ouer haue Paris. elena. we not another example of proude Tarquyn ye kynges
sone of rome that rauysshed the fayre Lucrece / the whi∣che Tarquus filius tarquy ni superbi re∣gis romano∣ū de quo va lerius: Mors lucia∣ne. Latellina. for pure sorowe slewe herselfe before all her frendes. It happened afterwarde that bothe his fader & he were chased out of rome vylaynously / and bycause of this the¦re was neuer kynge of Rome syth. Is it not wryten al∣so of Catellyna that was so dyuers / so cruell and so per ers / and how that after hym his neuewes became mo∣re cruell in vyllaynous dedes and homycyde than theyr vncle had ben afore them / and all was thrughe his vycy¦ous example. If a fader hathe ben euyll / the chyld shall be more vycyous / for moost comynly the chye ensueth the fader. Wherfore I saye that it were better for a chyl de to ensue the good & prudent men / than for to folowe a grete company of fooles replete with all vyces. Fyn∣de we not also how kynge Peleus resplendysshynge in Peleus. Achilles. this worlde gaue Phenyxe vnto Achylles for to endoc∣tryne and teche in all good vertues / that same Phenyxe was so dyscrete that it was a mruayllous thynge to se In lyke wyse dyde the kynge Phylyppe florysshyng in Philippus. Alexander. this worlde gaue his sone Alexaunder vnto Arystotle / prynce of phylosophres that hadde comprehended al the documentes of Platon. He instructe this chylde Alexā∣der so well in scyence that he was kynge of all the worl∣de. O what a dyscrete fader / o what a good mayster / o how gracyous a dyscyple / this presente tyme is not soo / for it is nowe holden and reputed shame / the folysshe fa¦ders setteth no store to set theyr chyldren to the ole for to lerne scyence that is the floure of all worldly thynges but complayneth theyr expences. And therfore frome a folysshe fader yssueth folysshe chyldren full of ygnraū∣e. The folysshe and redotyn fder is well content to e his chyldren dysend  gdes in vyces & excesse to
vyllaynously. They dysprayse all good vertues and ope Aristotes. Plato. racyons. Thynke vpon the harde complaynt that Cra∣tes made whan he sayd thus. Yf I were amytted for to speke I wolde name you fooles redotynge yt assem∣bleth pecunes and treasours by dysceytes fallacious for your chyldren and successours yt afterwarde shall spen∣de it in excesse and vyle superfluytes. Alas poore faders ye leue your chyldren vnpuruayed / ygnoraūt / and with out scyence as folysshe bestyall lunatykes / of the whiche thynge ye shall repente you faders full sore here after∣warde / whan that ye shall be bytten with dyuers morsu¦res bycause ye chastysed them not / and endoctryned thē not in good operacyons and condycyons. Some be to vycyous in dyspraysynge the thynges dyuine / the other ben of wycked and euyll lyfe / the other haue theyr spyry¦tes rauysshed / and dyspryseth all the treasours yt theyr fader hathe assembled / the other fyxeth all theyr herte & Prouerb. i. x. rates.

Wherfore do they presume to noblesse yt haue not deserued it by due payne
¶Oftentymes a mylde bytche bryngeth forth shrewed Seneca. Juuenalis. whelpes. In lyke wyse is it of good moders that hathe ryght vycyous chyldren. And yf the chyldren be dyuers the fader is culpable of theyr vycyousnes yf that he cor∣recte Ecca. xxii. them not in theyr youthe / for yf the fader chastyse them not the coulpe is his. ¶Of reportours and detractours. ca. vii ¶Who that maketh debate and also stryfe By false enuy and double retortynge And he whiche synfully ledeth his lyfe Euer in vyce and synne contynuynge Without remors of inwarde repentynge Bytwene two mylstones his body dothe bere There to haue guerdon as ye may se here.

Take ensam¦ple humayne creatures of Patroclus that was slayne by Hector bycause that he had praysed the guysarmes of Achylles / whiche wolde haue Justed agaynst the Tro∣yens. But Achylles came adoubed with al his armes in to ye batayl for to auenge his good frende Patroclus / & he dyde so moche that he founde Hector takynge a pryso¦ner / and whan he espyed hym he couched his spere and ranne hym in at the foundemente as he was takynge vp his prysoner and slewe hym. And after he bounde hȳ ilades. Horrestes. vnto his horse tayle by derysyon / and trayled hym afore the castell of ylyon in ye syght of his fader. Then he kep∣te Her narrat theodosius vt refert bo∣catius de ge∣nealo. deorū. libro. xii. capi pitu. xx. his body at the sepulcre of Patroclus by the space of twelue dayes and more / and in this maner he reuenged the dethe of his frende Patroclus. Consyder more ouer the hystorye of Horrestes that was kynge Agamenons sone / how after that Egistus by the exhortacyon and ste¦rynge of his moder Clitemestra hadde slayne his fader. By Electra his syster he was delyuered oute of Astro∣phylle Hanc hystori am pomt va∣lerius. li. iiii. capt. vi. for to saue hym frome dethe / for they wolde ha∣ue slayne hym. Horrestes knowynge that ye thynge wen¦te so / he thought that he wolde be auenged vpon his mo∣der Clytemestra and vpon the thefe Egisteus. And soo whan he had auenged the dethe of his fader Agamenon he became all frantyke & madde so yt it was grete pyte /
For alwaye hym thought that he saue his moder in flā∣bynge fyre and enuyronned with hedeous serpentes / ye whiche wolde haue slayne hym. ¶ Whan Pylades that was his perfyte frende sawe hym in suche inconuenyen¦ce / he promysed hym faythfully that he wolde neuer ha∣bandonne hym vnto the tyme that he were guarysshed So longe they wente by theyr Journeys that they ar∣ryued in the yle of Colchos / and there founde the tem∣ple of ye goddesse Dyane / whan theyr prayers were do∣ne and fynysshed / Horrestes receyued guaryson of his maladye / and neuer after that he sawe no more that ye whiche he had sene before / and that was by his loyall fe∣lowe that accomplysshed his auowe so truely. We rede also of Amon and of the good Pythyas that were so go Demades. Pithias Scipio. Lelius. valerius li. &c. supradic. Hercules. de felowes and frendes / for Denys the cruell tyraunte wolde haue put one of them to dethe / wherfore his felo∣we wolde not accorde therto / for the one was contente to suffre dethe for the other. In semblable wyse we haue example of Scypyon ryght excellent domynatour of so¦domy and Lybye that loued Lelyus so feruently that ye memorye redoundeth yet vnto this daye. Beholde we also the grete loue that Theseus had vnto Pyrrothus / ouidius & lac∣tantius nar∣rāt vt refert boca. de. ge. deo. li. ix. c. xxxiiii. Prouer.10. xiii. &. xxix. that for to rauysshe Proserpyne goddesse of helle / trans¦ported hym in to the cauerne / and whan Cerberus the porter of helle sawe Pyrrothus / anone he slewe hym. Theseus was taken prysoner by Pluto god of helle / the whiche made hym be bounden in a spelunke. Hercules aduertysed of the trouthe descended in to helle / and va∣ynquysshed all / and bounde Cerberus with thre chay∣nes / and after vnbounde Theseus and ledde hym away maugre all the enhabytauntes therin. By this we may vnderstonde the amyte of Theseus / and the pyte of Her¦cules

Suche frendes be no mo∣re in course / the tyme of loue is passed / for euery body entendeth to his synguler prouffyte / there is noo more fayth nor lawe in this worlde / to the moyen of this I cō¦clude that our volente and courage is worse than a spe∣re trauersynge some body / for we haue neyther felycyte nor loue / but soner crudelyte reygneth amonge vs / for the whiche cause it is no meruayll thoughe aduersyte do myne vpon vs that be voyde of benygnyte. ¶ Of the contēmynge of scrypture. c. xi. ¶ Who wyll byleue eloquacyte Of the foles seynge the scrypture Shewynge our grete felycyte And wyll not in vertues endure Is a grete fole without mesure Wherfore as foles makynge dyscordes Of our grete shyp they dresse the cordes

¶ The fooles that ben bounde with this corde I drawe in to myne excellent toures Bycause that they to me accorde In seruynge me well at all houres As true louers and paramoures For whome that I smyte feruently Can haue no salue but theyr lady POore folkes absented from al felycite open your eyen the whiche ben deiecte from ye lu∣mynayre Eccl. xi.

Uenus that is ye conductour of cupydo holdeth all louers in her bondes.
He is a foole that dystempereth hymselfe / and putteth hym in the waye of lamentacyons / of dystresse / of myse ryes / and of dolours / and submytteth them in ye seruyce of this lady. O how many excellent cytees hathe venus destroyed and brought to nought by her concupyscence. She hathe caused & empesshed many folke from theyr prosperyte and welfare. We rede of full many aūcyent men and women that hathe ben wounded by her of the darte of her swete sone Cupydo. By her ben happened many euylles. The Troyens hathe ben poore and dolo∣rous by her exhortacyon / and theyr noble cyte that was soo strongly fortefyed with walles & dytches dystroyed and brente. The septre of kynge Pryam that was soo tryumphaunt was casten downe / and all for the luxury of the fayre Parys yt rauysshed Helayne. O harde mor∣sure that for pleasure mondayne suffred suche ruyne & destruccyon. Was it not grete pyte that soo noble a cyte was destroyed for suche a cause. Also after that Marc{us} Anthonyus had vaynquysshed the Persyens and that Marcus an∣thonius. he had borne awaye the pryce / as he retorned he was ra uysshed in the loue of Cleopatra / that promysed hym ye Cleopatra. empyre of Rome / the whiche made his men for to arme them / and made prepayre two hondred shyppes garnys¦shed with arowes and dartes for to conquere the empy¦re of Rome. But Cezar made for to enquere of the folys she purpose of this louer. And dyscomfyted hym and all his men / wherthrugh he vndyde hymselfe in the cyte of Alexandre bycause yt they wolde not take hym to mer∣cy. ¶ And within a lytell whyle after Cleopatra in gre∣telamentacyons and sorowes made herself to be trans∣ported vnto the cyte of Alexandre besyde her louer mar¦cus Anthonyus by two serpentes yt she put to her pap∣pes
/ and there shedde her bloode excessyuely without ye conforte of ony body / and deyed besyde her louer. If the se two louers had maynteyned and contynued in chasty te they hadde not deyed so myserably. He that applyeth his tyme in loue hathe no reason / he is without lawe / & all euyll redoundeth vnto hym. The puyssaunce of Ue∣nus Ouidius. is suche that who that serueth her in loue is euer op¦pressed with dolour and bytter rage. He is not holden Prouer. v. for a prudent man that wyll not eschewe the darte yt he sholde be persecuted with. He sheweth hymselfe neuer constaunt that supporteth with all his mynde Uenus / & her sone Cupido. And who that is smyten by her can not dyssymyle neuer soo moche but that it s knowen in theyr vysage. Whan Theseus was in helle Phedra was Theseus. Phedre. ypolitus. rauysshed in the loue of ypolytus / the whiche wolde not loue suche a lady. Wherfore she was ryght angrye / and accusedhym to her husbande / saynge yt ypolytus wolde haue taken her by force. ¶ Fynably this ypolytus was quartred & drawen at foure horses tayles. And after yt he was deed she confessed that they had put hym wrong fully to deth. And then for veray poore sorowe and dys∣conforte she strangled herselfe pyteously. We rede also of Pasyphyle that by ardaunt concupyscence had a doo Pasipha. Dedalus. minotaurus. Nero. with a bulle / for Dedalus composed a cowe of wodde / and couered it with a cowes skynne / and put Pasyphy∣le therm / and then made her to go aboute ye courte / and the bulle chaufed hym so that he engendred on Pasyphy le a monstre that was halfe a man and halfe a bulle na∣med Mynotaure. Neron also the cruel man opened his moders belly: and dyd with his good noble moder by his cruelte ryght vyllayne his sensuall wyll / bycause that he wolde se the place of his nayssaunce & byrthe. Also Mes∣salyna
for her pleasaunce & concupyscence carnall wen∣te Messalina. et lassata viris nun{quam} satiata remansit. euery nyght to the bordell secretely / and with whome someuer she hadde ado with she was neuer contente nor pleased. And whan the mornynge came / and that ye day began to sprynge / she departed with suche an ardaunte hete that it is grete horroure for to here it recounted. For Uenus by the reporte of the poetes helde her in her bondes / bycause that she had seruyd loue all the days of her lyfe / the whiche was to her grete shame and dysho∣nour. Wherfore let these examples remayne euermore in your hertes. And folowe no more the scole of the god of loue / for who that ensueth it / lyueth euer in sorowe & dystresse / for it is destruccyon of all good vertues and o∣peracyons / as well to the man as to the woman. O fo∣lysshe louers that ben all plonged in the profoundenes of this vyle and abhomynable synne without hauynge aspecte vnto the saluacyon of thy poore soule. For also longe as the goddesse Uenus holdeth the in her handes of loue / yu liuest as an vnreasonable beest / in takynge all thy solace for to thynke on thy lady in loue. Thou for getest god and all his commaundementes / in seruynge her as thy god. O what an vnresonable foole is he that putteth a his Joye and delyte in a vyle carcas that is so corrupte with all vyces. ¶ I adde here to the abhomy∣nable bns that synneth agaynst god and nature / In au. vt non luxu. contra natu. cola. vi. and agaynst al the courte celestyal of paradyse / this vn∣happy synne is so vyle and abhomynable that after the scrypture whan it is spoken of it infecteth ye ayer euery man ought to abhorre it / for the vyndycacion th on them before god and to borne them as he d Sodome and Gomore. . .

Of auncyente by me he fourmed ye worlde / and put all thynges necessary therin / and there had nothynge ben created in the ayer / nor in the worlde had I not bene. Wherfore then folysshe mondaynes do ye not your besy cure for to lerne doctrine / for he the whi¦che is replenysshed with prudence and sapyence shal ne¦uer be oppressed with calamyte / for I shall socoure hym at all tymes whan he calleth after my helpe.

He ought to ascende in to oure shyppe by reason for to be of the nombre of our grete foles that bosteth hym of his good fortune / saynge that she laugheth on hym at euery ceason / and that she is euer egal to hym / and that she neuer varyeth / and that all happeneth to hym after his desyre and trust.

Lo in this maner of wyse fortune rewardeth her subgectes. Wher¦fore I saye that he is a perfyte foole that putteth his es∣peraunce in the goodes of fortune / and that he is the de∣uylles sone / for bycause of the trust that he hathe in the goodes of fortune he leueth to honoure god and his saȳ∣tes. The deuyll tempteth hym so sore that he fyxeth all sn in her∣cule furente. his herte vpon the rychesse mondayne / and oftentymes he gyueth hym largely the whiche conduyteth hym to ye grete pyt of helle withouten ony faute.

And this same Cinicus was more Joyous than they that haue the fayre edefyces. Is it not than grete tranquylyte vnto a man for to charge hym by reason / & not to vndertake a thynge yt he can not bere. Is it not grete foly vnto this poore fole for to take so grete a char¦ge vpon hym / and for to comprehende a thynge that he can not brynge to an ende / and knoweth well

And whan that Janenalis. {pro}uer. xvii. Capientie. v.

Alas we wyll not do that whiche god commaundeth vs / but rather do agaynste his commaundement / and in doynge soo he sendeth vs his maladyccyon and mysery. Note well that god often Ecca. xii. xxiii. q. iiii.

And he hateth nothynge soo mo∣che as to fynde a thynge that pleaseth hym / whan he is goynge out of the felde.

Bycause that he is full of vyce / and that he sholde nou∣rysshe peas in crystendome / and he kepeth warre. who is the cause / lacke of good vertues / and good counsayll / It were better for hym for to withdrawe his swerde / & maynteyne ryght as his predecessours haue done. He yt dothe agaynst his conscyence is ryght cruell / and setteth nought by his good renowne. ¶ The palays imperyall was somtyme in grete honour / the whiche is now al ca∣ducke. Emperour haue aspecke vnto thyn operacyons / and remembre that thou muste deye / & be wormes me∣te / and become as shes / and that after that thy good de∣des shall be weyed in a iuste balaunce. O kynges ye whi∣che ad rege. is in maieste ryall / ye may make lawes in your real∣me
/ you haue grete puyssaunce / for by your arbytre all is gouerned.

Suffre noo Justyce to be done on faderies chyldren and pore wedowes / you make bysshoppes abbottes & pryours within your real∣mes / and yet certaynly you maye not / for they ought to be made by the eleccyon of the chapytre / this same put∣teth the prelates in descencyon. Loys the leuenth of that c. cum in cū ctis de elec. name kynge of fraunce demaunded of a bysshop wher∣fore the bysihoppes of this present tyme dyde not myra¦cles also well as the bysshoppes in olde tyme / and ye bys¦shop answered hym. Syr the cause is bycause that they that put the bysshoppes in theyr syeges cathedralles ha¦ue no puyssaunce for to do it. But whan they are perfy∣te of true eleccyon / the holy ghost is with hym / the whi∣che may do myracle / and suche bysshoppes / abbottes / & pryours may well do myracles.

One can not nowe haue a benefyce without pledynge / and thus the benefy¦ces is occupyed by force. Symonye dothe it not reygne / The benefyces be they not solde. I byleue yes / the whi∣che is a greate plage. In the tyme passed the vylagy∣ens were wonte but for to paye vnto ye emperoure. xxvi pens for theyr heedes / but nowe they are soo sore pylled that it is pyte for to here theyr clamoure. Axtaxerxers imposed fyrste the trybutes / the assyryens payed theym fyrste / and then the perses / the Macedonyens / and then ceasar constreyned the romayns to paye it. There is not nowe neyther frenshmen nor ytalyens calabryens / nor
the men of the pope but that they be constrayned for to paye that trybute and yet wors than trybute. you suffre yet that your men of armes ete vp the poore folkes of ye vyllages / whan you be in ony towne it is horrour to he∣re the lyues of your men / they be so moche abandoned to do euyll / and are supported by you in all theyr vyces / they be habandoned vno lecherye / whether they be may dens or wyues they dystroye all / and then who hath do∣ne it / my lorde / or an archer of the garde / and so they es∣cape without punysshynge by your supportacion. They fyght and kyll and do innumerable euylles / and bycau∣se they be not punysshed they be wors and wors / & theyr lorde hathe none honoure. Thynke you not vpon y• kyn¦ge Dauyd that for the louynge that he loued Bersabee Dauid Bersabe Urias wyfe vnto Urye / was called a blodye man / & his peo∣ple was punysshed for his synne. you care not you be so replete with pryde and mondanytees. you be armed wt grete pompes and habytes large and superfluous / u haue not grete payne for to wynne that the whiche you dyspende / alas you thynke not. The ryght by you is no∣thynge susteyned.

We fynde well in the ryght cyuyll yt one may proue his strengthe / otherwyse not / and in su∣che maner he is not bounden to the lawe aquylye. They do the contrary whiche is a woūde made in ryght. Alas Emperours / kynges / dukes / erles and barons vulnere hym no more / suffre not that ryghte be vsurped within your realmes and countrees / yf that you wyll that your domynacyons prospere in goodnes and tranquylyte,: /
¶ O ryght crysten kynge of Englonde I beseche the al¦so humbly as I may that thou suffre not within thy no∣ble realme that ryght be vsurped by thy subgectes and offycers. Thou arte the moost noble kynge & the moost myghtyest that is vpon the erthe / for thou arte the relu¦cent sterre of all the terryens / endewed with al vertues the odeferous floure descended frome paradyse moost marcyall in batayll / amyable as a lady / fayre as absolon wyse as Salomon / dyscrete as Agamenon / & all good meurs remayneth in the / wherfore yllustred kynge ex∣cercyse egall iugement / and in so doynge ye shall be exal∣ted in the sempyternall courte / with the rose fyrst stocke of your generacyon. The good kynge Henry loued noo blasshemynge but punysshed the swerers but who that can now moost blassheme god / is moost made of in cour¦te. you gyue euyll example vnto them that cometh after you / and the thynges of euyll examples oughte to be es∣chewed / but you vpholde them / you make dyuers fayre statutes / but they endure but a whyle. Shewe thyselfe valyaunt in vertues / loue the prouffyte and vtylyte of the thynge publyke. Thynke vpon the aūcyent Romay∣nes the whiche loued better for to deye poore / than the welthe publyke sholde haue ben enpayred. After that is some comen yt loueth better to enryche themselfe than ye good publyke / wherby they are comen vnto grete ruyne The consules and senatours of this presente tyme haue not the fame that ye auncyent romaynes were wonte to haue / for they loue better theyr owne prouffyte than the comyn prouffyte / and corrumpe the ryght for to do plea¦sure vnto theyr frendes. The cause is bycause they are not replete with vertues / for they are rauysshynge wul¦ues / without supportynge or defendynge of the ryghte /
thou ought for to knowe what ryght is / to the ende that whan they demaunde the some countree londe or rente Uide bal. in repentiōe. l. . i. xiii col.  de sū. .  bal. i dicta l. fi. that thou mayst answere them after ryght and reason / and examyne well and iustely the cause or that you gy∣ue ony sentence vpon ony thynge / and in soo doynge ye shall acquyre grete meryte of the Juge eternal the whi¦che Jugeth euery thynge / and after theyr deserte remu¦nereth them in the sempyternall mansyon. Wherfore lo¦ke that ye put men the whiche are vertuous and Juste for to gouerne ryght and Justyce / for suche folkes are Baldus in. l. i. ff. de sena. ff. de ori. iur. bal. de ori. . Pilatus. l. is apud. . de edendo. worthy for to rule or gouerne ony crysten regyon / or he∣then / for there as ryght wysmen is domynatours there is egall iugement also well to the poore and nedy as vn∣to the ryche / but at this present tyme it is grete pyte for to here the exclamacyon of the poore people / for they can not haue no ryght without gyuynge of large moneye / & thus auaryce hathe banysshed ryght out of this countre Put no rauysshynge wulues to gyue iugement / nor no marchauntes / the whiche haue no desyre but for to wyn in lettynge the welthe publyke fall in to ruyne. Juges rede you neuer of the Jugement of Alpius the whiche was amerous of a mayden that was brought vnto him for to be out of seruytude / but her fader Uyrginyus wyl¦lynge for to saue her from dyshonour / tupracyon slewe her before the Romayns and bare the heed vnto that Al¦pius. Nor in lyke wyse of the doughter of Lauyon that was slayne. Myrre you herm and of the Jugement that Pylate made on Ihesu cryste. It is wryten that the lo∣ue of maydens subuerteth the Juges that doo not true Justyce. Juge iustely the sone of man. Suche Juges is hated of euery body. A good Juge ought to enquere the . de aduo. l. aduocatri. laudabili in trouthe / and then to gyue sentence on the thinge proued
and none otherwyse. Aduocates you ought to desyre the principio. . de aduoca. di uerudi. comune welthe and defende the ryght for you are equy∣pared to the knyghtes for by you as knyghtes is the ly and the patrymony defended. your offyce is necessary & louable. Wherfore leue all decepcyons and false lagacy∣ons and maynteyne the ryght. Put sergeauntes of go∣de lyues in offyces for to kepe the people the better / with out puttynge in a grete sorte of rascalles and rybaudes that pylleth the poore people / and renneth nyght & daye to ye bordell in vsurpynge euery body bycause that they bere the names of sergeauntes / yf there happen debate in ony place / and that theyr handes be greced / they wyl let the malefactours go / yf they haue cōmyssyon to take ony body / they shall drynke with hym / and in payenge the scotte wyll let hym go. But who that put good men in offyce sholde cause dyuers deceytes to be vndone in ci¦tees and townes / in some townes there is honest serge∣auntes and of good lyfe / or elles they are expulsed. ¶ O de vi. & ho. c. 33. q. vi. c. cle∣rici &. c. qicū{que} ar. 23. q. 3. maximianus men of the chirche lede holy lyues without berynge har∣neys staffe or swerde / saue whan that ye goo out of the towne for daunger of theuys / or for to defende the tow∣ne agaynst theyr enemyes / & yet you ought not to stry∣ke yf that ye may.

I haue grete doubte that she aske not vengeaunce agaynst you. Alas humay¦nes that vsurpeth the ryght / thynke on the horryble pay¦nes of hell yt is apparaylled for to punysshe the synners yf you wyll lyue well in this worlde / ensue the dyscrete men / for and ye be conuersaunt with euyll people truely ye shall be vycyous.

We se dyuers trauersynge this se without ores / or sayle / they be without lawe and without ordre / the whi∣che

I fynde these folkes fooles syth theyr neyssaun¦ce. Dyuers haue perysshed in this maner the whiche ha¦ue transgressed the lawe and the waye that god hath de∣termyned to thynges. All thynges yt is in heuen / in erth and in the see lyueth in kepynge theyr ordre / and kepeth them strongely in vygoure / the whiche yf they fayle and cease in theyr ordre / incontynent theyr vertue shal passe and fall vnto nought in grete ruyne.

Adam in lyke wyse bycause there was none ordre in his case / and that he dyde contrary to goddes cōmaundement / felle in to pyteous ruyne. Cayn also bycause that he kepte none or¦dre in his dedes / & that he knewe well that he dyde euyll to se his broder Abel made a pyteous ende. yf the elemē¦tes helde them not fixed in theyr ordre they sholde perys¦she al sodaynly. Alas then ought we well to drede whan that the thynges that haue noo reason be in daunger of punycyon. All thynges haue ordre / certayne tyme & spa¦ce to bere / to lyue / and to deye. The vertue of this orde is / kepe certayne lawe and cōmaundementes ordeyned The lytell ought to obserue and obeye to the greter / but at this tyme the contrary is done. Almoost all thynges is done contrary. Wherfore but yf that we kepe better ordre we are lyke to be punysshed eternally.
