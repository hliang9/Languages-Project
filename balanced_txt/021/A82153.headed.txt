A DECLARATION OF THE General Council OF THE Officers of the ARMY, Agreed upon at Wallingford-House the 27th. of October, 1659. ALthough all occasions are very unpleasing unto us, whereby we are necessita∣ted by Declaration, or Ap∣peal to justifie our selves, or our Actings to these Nati∣ons, and especially when (to do our selves right) we must necessarily in∣sist upon the failings and miscarriages of others:
Yet seeing it hath pleased God by the hand of his wise and all-disposing Providence, to bring the Affairs of this Commonwealth into the State and Condition wherein now they are, We hold our selves obliged to give an accompt to the People thereof, and of our Proceedings therein: And conceiving it unnecessary to look back, or reflect upon the secret Designs which were con∣trived in that Parliament that ended the 12th. of April last, and broke forth in the late Insurrecti∣on in Cheshire, and other parts of this Nation, to the extreme hazard of the Lives and Estates of all the well-affected people of this Common∣wealth, and of whatsoever is valuable and dear unto them, We hope it will be sufficient at this time to declare as followeth. That before the re-calling of the late Parlia∣ment, we had divers consultations, and thoughts of heart, in what way and manner we might most effectually provide for the Peace and good Government of this Commonwealth; and at length, calling to mind those many great things which had been effected for the good of these Nations, during the Sitting of the said Parlia∣ament; And being likewise fully perswaded, that the Government of these Nations might be most happily placed upon the Foundation of a Com∣monwealth, and that upon such Principles, as was then agreed upon by us, and hoping that through their experience in Affairs of Govern∣ment,
we might most safely deliver the Power and Trust of these Nations into their hands, having likewise those further encouragements, That they, having lain for some years under that Rebuke, which God had given them for their former mis∣carriages, would thereby have been instructed to follow him more close, in the paths leading to Peace and Righteousness: And also from some previous Meetings, with some worthy and leading Members of that House, who, upon debate with us, approved of the Principles aforesaid, and communicated them to divers of their fellow Members, That not onely old displeasures would have been forgotten, but that the single welfare and setled Government of this Commonwealth, would have been onely aimed at: and (as by one of the chief amongst themselves was exprest) having in Two moneths, or thereabouts, setled the Government of these Nations) go up with Moses to mount Nebo, and die. And although we were not ignorant, that by their former inter∣ruption, it was the opinion of many learned and able persons, who well understood Affairs of that kind, that the late Parliament was wholly Dis∣solved; and especially by the peoples succeeding Elections, who, upon Writs issued out to them for that purpose, reseized that Trust which they had formerly given them. And to this purpose let us repeat an expression of an eminent person; who sate as a Member in both the late Parlia∣ments,
(and was deeply concerned in these late Actings) used upon another occasion in Parlia∣ment. That the people by their Electing Members, to represent them in Parliament, had cut that knot with their own Sword, which by no other ways was capable to be dissolved or broken; Yet being desirous, like drowning men, (who are ready to sieze upon every Twig) to lay hold of any thing that had the least appearance of Civil Authority, thereby hoping, not onely to keep these Nati∣ons from sinking into Confusion, but to see it hap∣pily established upon the Basis aforementioned: We did think fit by our Declaration of the 6th. of May last, to invite the Members of that Par∣liament, to return to the Exercise and Discharge of the Trust formerly reposed in them; which being by them accordingly accepted, soon after their Sitting, we did, in a most humble and solemn manner, present our Petition and Address unto them, wherein was contained the sum of our desires and principles aforesaid: To which we had, to our great content, ample assurance of the Parliaments good acceptance exprest not only by their hearty thanks at that time, but after by their Votes, approving divers of the same, and promi∣sing to provide for others, referred the same to several Committees of their own Members, ap∣pointed for that purpose. Things being brought (as we then hoped) to
a good posture, tending towards Settlement & Sa∣tisfaction, we did expect the speedy fruits thereof, when contrary to our expectations, instead of an effectual and full Act of Oblivion, (desired in our third Proposal, as the medium of quiet and securi∣ty to our selves, and other the well-affected peo∣ple of the Commonwealth, who had served under the former Governments, and of encouragement to us, and them again with chearfulness under them, to discharge our duties in our and their respective places and stations) we found it a long time to hang in suspence, and at last (after divers and earnest importunities to many Members of Parliament) and Act of Indempnity came forth so imperfect and ineffectual for the ends expected, as that not onely our selves, but divers others were left liable to ruine at their pleasures, and subject to trouble and molestation at Law, for Acts done for the publick Service; as well during the time of their former Sitting, as under other suc∣ceeding Governments. And for what concerned our desires in our 12th. proposal, (for the union of the Forces of this Commonwealth) wherein we did unani∣mously own the Lord Fleetwood to be Comman∣der in Chief of the land Forces of this Common∣wealth; and concerning which, we had assurance given, that the same should be granted in Parli∣ament: we were not less deceived in our expecta∣tion, his Commission being restrained to the For∣ces
of England and Scotland, and limited to the fixth of May next ensuing; or to be revoked at pleasure: and the further to abridge him of the Authority necessarily belonging to the Comman∣der in Chief of an Army, for the good Government thereof: And to render the Army wholly sub∣servient to their will, they Resolved, That all Commissions should be given out by the Speaker, o∣pening a way to decline or cast out whom they pleased, without so much as hearing: which nevertheless, for peace sake, was submitted unto by the Army; it being then affirmed, that no such thing had been, or ever would be done in Parliament, which proved otherwise in the se∣quel, as will be hereafter more particularly ma∣nifested. What factions hereupon grew up in the Army, what new moulding, changing and transform∣ing thereof (to the discomposure of the whole) how prodio were made, headed, and encoura∣ged by divers Members sitting in Parliament, and strengthened; not onely by bringing divers per∣sons into Command of prejudiced mindes, but by removing faithful Officers into remote parts of this Commonwealth, without any cause shewen, or consultations had with the Commander in Chief thereupon, was not onely notoriously known by those, who are concerned in Military Affairs, but obvious to common observations. By which means the aforementioned Design of a general
Insurrection took further encouragement, spread∣ing it self into every part of this Nation: and being now grown ripe (though by the wonder∣full goodness of God prevented in other pla∣ces) broke forth in Cheshire the first of August last, where a considerable Number of Horse and Foot were speedily drawn together, and formed into an Army, under the Command of Sir George Booth and others; For the suppression of which, a convenient Number of the Army were ap∣pointed to march under the Command of Ma∣jor General Lambert, and (through the bles∣sing of God upon their faithful and chearful en∣deavours) that Enemy was suddenly routed and subdued, and the whole Nation reduced again to quietness, with little loss of bloud, and less of other the sad marks and effects which usually attend a Civil war. The full sence of which Mercy put it into the hearts and mindes of some Officers of that part of the Army, to meet and consider how the same might be improved to the glory of God, and good of the Common-wealth: And thereupon resolved upon a Paper, which, toge∣ther with a Letter, they sent to the Lord Fleet-wood, desiring if he saw it fit, to communicate it to a General Council of Officers for their appro∣bation: His Excellency (desiring to put the same into such a way as might not savour of offence to the Parliament, or any member thereof) consulted with Sir Arthur Hesilrig thereupon,
and in order to the taking further counsel there∣in, desired that he, Sir Henry Vane and Major Salwey, would meet with himself to consider of such course to be taken in this matter, as might best sute with the present occasion and posture of affairs: But contrary to expectation and all ingenuity (although a meeting was agreed up∣on) the next day Sir Arthur Hesilrig informed the House of the said Paper, representing that some dangerous design against the Parliament, was on foot in the Army, and intentions to in∣troduce a new Government, by setting up a sin∣gle person, though that Paper was manifestly contrary to any such end or purpose, as by its being exposed to publique view, will more fully appear. Whereupon, the House possest with prejudice upon this misinformation, fell into high debates, expressing great heat and anger against the Lord Lambert, and several other faithful Officers of the Brigade, from whence the Paper came, although they were truly informed by the Lord Fleetwood, and others, that the Lord Lambert gave no consent, nor had any hand in the same, but endeavoured the suppression there∣of both before and after his coming to Town; And also although neither the Paper it self, nor the matter of fact was before them, nor the per∣sons admitted to speak for themselves, so that now it was apparent, that those factions already laid, began again to pursue, what they had in
prospect and design more openly and vigorously then before. Hereupon the Officers of the Ar∣my, thought it their duty to represent to the Parliament their innocency, and to vindicate themselves from those aspersions which were un∣worthily and falsly charged upon them, and withall (to obviate the afore-mentioned de∣signs) to desire that the Army might receive their Commissions, with the advice of such per∣sons, who by experience had the knowledge of their abilities and fitness for service, and that they might not be turned out arbitrarily, but by the usual and known way of a Court Martial, and being willing to bury all prejudices by-past, they desired only that some Checque and dis∣couragement might be put upon such, who (for the future) should endeavour to beget mis∣understandings between the Parliament and them. And lastly, asserting the Liberty and Rights belon∣ging to all the People of this Commonwealth, as also to themselves, of presenting in a peaceable and submissive way their desires to the Parliament, which being expressed in our Representation and Petition, was humbly presented to them on the 5th. of this instant October. The reception where∣of being accompanied with the Thanks of the House, gave again renewed hopes of a right un∣derstanding between the Parliament and the Army. Both which Representation and Petition,
together with the Answer of the House thereunto, have been already exposed to publick view. The general Council of Officers, when they agreed the aforesaid Representation and Petition, resolved then, (to the end the true state of af∣fairs might be commanicated unto those of the Army, who were equally concerned with them) That Copies thereof should be sent to the Officers of the several Regiments, Troops, Companies, and Gar∣risons, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, Invi∣ting them (in case they were free thereunto) to con∣curre with them in their just desires: And like∣wise appointing the said Letter to be Signed by a Committee of Officers which they had appointed for that purpose. The Parliament upon the 10th. of October, ta∣king into debate the said humble Representation and Petition, Resolved in answer to the first Pro∣posal, That the Officers of the Army had received, and should from time to time receive marks of the favour of the Parliament, and countenance answer∣able to their faithfulness and merit. Which, how far it did answer the reasonable part of their de∣sire, we leave to all indifferent persons to judge, when they shall duely weigh the following pro∣ceedings. In the afternoon of the same day they did resolve, that this be the answer to the second Proposal, That it is the duty of all Persons, especi∣ally Members of Parliament, to informe the House
of any thing which in their apprehension may con∣cern the publick safety. And, that it is the undoubt∣ed right of the Parliament, to receive and debate those Informations, and resolve what they think fit thereupon. Where we cannot choose but take notice, that this being applied to the said second Proposal, it asserts it to be the duty of all persons to informe the House of any thing, be it never so frivolous and false, which in their apprehensi∣ons concern the publick safety. And that it is the undoubted right of the Parliament to receive and debate those informations, and to resolve there∣upon if they think sit, the ruine and destruction of them, and their Families, who are informed a∣gainst, before the said persons be heard, or their Case truly stated before them. Upon Tuesday the next day after, a Bill was brought into the House, and, contrary to the u∣sual Orders of Parliament, thrice read in one and the same day, and passed into an Act, thereby enacting, That all Orders, Ordinances, and Acts made by any single Person and his Coun∣cil, or by both or either of them, or otherwise, or by any Assembly, or Convention pretending to have Authority of Parliament, from and after the 19. day of April 1653. and before the 7. of May 1659. and which have not been, or shall not be enacted, allow∣ed, or confirmed by this present Parliament, be, should be, and were thereby declared, deemed, ta∣ken, and adjudged to be of no force or effect, from
and after the said 7. of May, 1659. which was altogether contrary to what was humbly desi∣red in the third Preposal of the Petition and ad∣dress of the 12. of May, 1659. and to what they gave us just grounds to expect, having commit∣ted that Proposal to a Committee of their own, to bring in such Bill or Bils for that purpose, as they thought necessary. And in the same Bill it was likewise contain∣ed, That no Person or Persons should after the 11. of October (being the very day that the said Act was hastily passed) raise Moneys without consent of the people in Parliament, thereby in an instant putting a doubt and discomposure up∣on all mens mindes that are concerned in mat∣ters of that nature, so that if any thing should cross such their strange proceedings, the Army might be necessitated to that odious Refuge of Free Quarter, or else be exposed to such provo∣cations, through the want of a fit provision for their subsistence, as might alienate their mindes from that care and duty that is incumbent on them, for the peace and security of the Common∣wealth. And not only so, but the other mischiefs a∣rising from this precipitate Act will prove many and great. For then the most choice and godly Ministers of the Nation, will be found to be comprised herein, and themselves and their main∣tenances altogether avoided, and great numbers
of prophane and scandalous Ministers, which have been ejected for near the space of six years past, will then be re-estated; the Adventurers and Souldiers Lands in Ireland left at a loss and in confusion; the Rebels that were transplant∣ed there, be at their liberty to return; the union made between England and Scotland rendred invalid; All the Compositions and Assurances thereupon given and made to the Protestants in Ireland, and to the excepted persons and Delin∣quents in Scotland and Ireland made insignificant; divers Souldiers, who have for a long time in our former times of Difficulty, and have since either voluntarily upon reducements, or other∣wise left the Army, and betaken themselves to several Occupations and Callings within several Towns, and Occupations for a Livelihood to them and their Families, are not only for the future disinabled to profess and use the same, but like∣wise left liable to the severity of the Laws and Customes, for all things done contrary thereunto since the 7. of May 1659; All Estates conferred on any person or persons by former Governments, though upon never so valuable and publick con∣siderations, left in a dangerous and uncertain con∣dition, to the unravelling and unknown discom∣posure of several mens estates and interests, the consequences whereof will in short time appear by the sad effects of multiplying suits and vexation of innocent persons, if the said Act could be deem∣ed
as valid. Concerning which we shall adde no more but, that had not strange precipitancy and design driven it on, it could hardly be believed, that any Supreme Authority would ever have ex∣posed a people to such inconveniences. Things being thus prepared in order to fur∣ther ends, the next day (being Wednesday) the Parliament hoping they had a great influence upon part of the Army, and conceiving they had by their late Acts sufficiently perplexed those whom they doubted might oppose them, and that the Government of these Nations was so sure in their own hands, as in all probability things might come to confusion, except mana∣ged by themselves, proceed vigorously to put their designs in practice. In the morning the Doors of the Lobby, by their appointment being fast shut and guarded, that none might by any means come near to the House, or understand their proceedings: Occasion is administred from one of the Letters which was signed by several Officers, according to appointment of the Gene∣ral Council, and sent to a Regiment of the Army, and produced by a Member of the House (it being of no other purport then the sending the said Representation and Petition to one of the Re∣giments of the Army as is before-mentioned) Yet nevertheless they fell foul upon the several Officers who had subscribed it, and took this rise in pursuance of their former intent to make a
plain breach upon the Army; and thereupon vote out of their Commands (without hearing any one person speak for himself, or examine whe∣ther the persons whose names were subscribed, were their hand-writing or not) the Lord Lam∣bert, General Disborow, and seven other Colonels and Field Officers, disposing divers of their Com∣mands to the Officers next under them: And as they did the day before, so now, they hastily pas∣sed it into an Act before they rose, for the making void the Lord Fleetwoods Commission, and in∣vesting the Command of the Army in seven persons, whereof himself was one, some of whom were the principal in carrying on this whole design. Whereupon the House ad∣journed, and three of the said number imme∣diately repaired to the Speakers chamber: And having provided themselves of six barrels of Powder, and a quantity of Provision, forthwith gave out orders for Colonel Morley's Regi∣ment to draw thither; as also to divers other Regiments, Troops and Companies, which they thought would be most sure to them; And like∣wise gave order to Colonel Okey to draw his Re∣giment to the Palace-yard, upon which he mar∣ched to Tuttle fields with four of his troops; and from thence (having sent one into the Palace yard he marched with the other three into Lon∣don for countenancing the drawing together the Militia forces, in order to a conjunction with them,
which proved there ineffectuall, but had other suc∣cess in Southwark, where by like directions, Colo∣nel Thomsons Regiment drew together under the command of their Lieutenant Colonel; and that no endeavors might be wanting, Orders were sent to Colonel Hackers Regiment, quartering in and about Leicestershire, and other Troops in other remote places in the Country, to march to West∣minster with all speed; the tendency whereof must naturally lead to the engaging the City; Country, and Army, in blood. The Officers of the Army having received no∣tice of these things, and being greatly amused at so strange and sudden a mutation, and that the office of Commander in chief, should be this minute executed by the hand of my Lord Fleetwood, and the next by the hands of Sr Arthur Hesilrig, Co∣lonel Morley, and Colonel Walton; and that Or∣ders were so speedily hastned out for the drawing of force together, were in great doubt that such strange and violent courses did portend some sad and fatal event: And thereupon they judged it their duty, for preservation of themselves, their friends, and honest interest in the Nation and Ar∣my, to draw together in Arms, and march to the Palace yard at Westminster (the place they had appointed for their rendezvous) to understand the reasons and grounds of their so assembling themselves together: And being arrived there, and perceiving that several Companies of Colo∣nel
Morley's Regiment were placed in the Hall, Gatehouse, Clockhouse, and Exchequer Chamber, and thereabouts, in hostile manner, all endeavours were used to inform them of the true state of af∣fairs, and to draw them to such a compliance with the rest of their brethren of the Army, as might a∣void the effusion of blood; but finding them, by the perswasion of their leaders, obstinately bent to oppose, We found our selves necessitated to put the Forces into a posture of defence; and for the grounds and reasons aforementioned, (as also, that they might not be futher encouraged and counte∣nanced in such a dangerous opposition, to the ap∣parent hazard of the publick peace) to put a pe∣riod and determination to the Parliaments meet∣ing together; and think our selves yet further obliged, for preventing of the manifold evils and inconveniences, which must necessarily fall upon the other good people of the Nation, as well as our selves, by reason of the severall Orders, Acts, pre∣tended Acts or other Declaration, or any of them, enacted, made, or past on Munday the 10th of this instant October, and on Tuesday and Wednesday then next following, to declare them and every of them, null and void to all intents and purposes; And do hereby declare them, and every of them, and every clause and sentence therein, invalid, null and void, to all intents and purposes: And likewise all Acts, Orders, and proceedings there∣upon had or done, in as full, and ample manner, as
if the said Orders, Acts, pretended Acts or Decla∣rations, and every of them, had never been. All which we thought fit to publish and declare, to the end all persons concerned may take notice there∣of; and no person whatsoever suffer any further prejudice thereby, hoping that all peaceable, well minded, and unprejudiced persons will acquiesce in the necessity and justice thereof. And now we shall conclude, in declaring to the World, that it is upon our hearts, and we ear∣nestly desire, and shall endeavour, that a due li∣berty may be assured to all the free born people of these Nations, both as Men and Christians: that a full and through Reformation of the Law may be effected, as also that a Faithful, godly, and pain∣ful gospel-preaching Ministery may be encouraged and provided for, by some certain way that may be less troublesome to them, and less vexatious to the people, then that of Tithes. And we do further Declare, That we have no aim or ends to set up a Military or Arbitrary Government over this Commonwealth; but have already provided that the Civil and Executive part of Government may be be lodged in a Com∣mittee of safety, and they obliged in a short time, to prepare such a form of Government, as may best suit and comport with a free State and Commonwealth, without a Single Person, King-ship or House of Pears: And that we shall to the ut∣most of our endeavours, labor to obtain those
desirable things so often declared for; and to maintain and preserve the Peace of these Nations in our several Stations and Places, and shall hope that God for his own Glory, and the good of his own People, will give a blessed end of these trou∣bles, by a happy Settlement upon the principles formerly declared for; and which have been, and still are so earnestly breathed after, by all those who truly fear his Name, Who, we doubt not, being truly sensible of the many temptations besetting us on every hand, the great difficulties we labor under, (and know not what farther straits a day may bring forth) will say on our behalfs, who are sufficient for these things? And out of former experiences, being taught, that the Lord is a present help in time of trouble, will cry aloud for us before the Throne of Grace, That the Lord himself may appear, and carry on his own work in our hands. And if it shall please him by his Spirit, to stir up those that fear his Name to be instant on our behalfs, We shall not fear what evil men can do unto us. FINIS.
