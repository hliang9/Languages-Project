GENTLEMEN, BEing imployed in the service of the City and State, to attend the London-Brigade, now joyned with Sir William Waller, and at that time intrusted to acquaint you with our proceed∣ings the last week; I am bold, after my humble service, to present to you a brief Relation of the most remarkable Passages between us and the Enemy, not onely in duty to you, but also in love to all those that long to be truly informed in the particular. May it please your Honour; Upon Thursday the 21. of this instant March (our Brigade being quartered at Midhurst) our Major Generall re∣ceived Orders from Sir William Waller, to advance towards Winchester to a Town called Traford, which accordingly he did with incredible speed, almost at an hours warning, and that night ar∣rived there, which we found to be a small Vil∣lage, not above seven or eight houses to quarter all our men, there we met with much hardship, staying for Orders till the Lords day following; Upon Monday the 25, we marcht forwards to
ioyn with Sir William Wallers main body, which accordingly wee did, and that night were ap∣pointed to quarter at Westmean, three miles di∣stant from the main body, where we found a partee of the Enemies horse when our Quarter∣masters entred the Town, which occasioned some action, though not much considerable, we onely took a Quartermaster prisoner; the next day, which was Tuesday, we lay still, onely our Scouts brought in some prisoners, 6 Troops incountring with 16 of the Enemies, put them to flight▪ and brought away 3. of them prisoners; The day following we discovered the Enemy, who took some fevv of our men that vvere strag∣ling from their colours, and soon after appeared in a great body upon the hill on the left hand the Tovvn, intending (as some prisoners confessed) to take us at Church, it being the Fast day; but it pleased God, vvho foresavv the Plot, to prevent the danger, directing us to keep the Fast the Wednesday before, vvhen vve lay still at Mid∣hurst, so that vvee vvere provided to entertain them, and drevv our men into a body neer the town, which done, Orders came to march away, which accordingly we did, in the Forlorn-Hope, expecting the Enemy every hour to fall upon us,
so that we were forced to make a stand a mile or more from the town in extream danger, till Sir William Wallers forces came up from Eastmean to joyn with us, then we marcht along till we came neer to Cheriton, to a place called by some, Lamborough-field, where wee quartered all night, the Enemy lying upon Sutton Common, and some part of them neerer to us, so neer that the Sentinels could heare one another talke: Upon Thursday morning a com∣manded partee was sent to view the Enemie, which they did, and incountered with a forlorne hope of the Ene∣mies, and behaved themselves very bravely, so that day was spent in skirmishes, where much gallantry and true valour was shewed by our horse, especially two men whose names I do not well remember, to the perpetuall honour of the actors, and great admiration of the specta∣tors; by whose meanes a considerable partee was once in∣gaged, and the enemy came on with a great body, which appearing, we discharged one▪gun, which did such executi∣on in our sight, that they all fled. This day a Counsell of War was called by both par∣tees, both by us and the Enemie, as since we are informed, and the ingagement was such, that of necessity they must give battell or retreat with much dishonour, the next mor∣ning we prepared for the worke, and having sought to God for assistance, we did addresse our selves to the ser∣vice; in the first place, a forlorn hope was drawn out of our brigade, four files out of a company, led on by Captain Tompson, a stout man, who were sent to take possession of a wood which lay on the right hand betweene us and the enemie, which they obtained with ease in the enemies sight; but such was their policy, that they foreseeing the necessity of our gaining the wood, if ever we gave battell to them in that place, planted their Drakes on the further side of the wood, which they discharged upon our men so thick, that the place was not tenible, though the greatest part of our Musketteers, and some others, were drawn up
to them, so that they were forced to retreat in one houres space, which gave great incouragement to the Enemie, who presently came on with their main body of horse, very powerfully, and were met as couragiously, yet being of the greater number (for our whole body was not then together) forced ours to a disorderly retreat, at which time the day was doubtfull, if not desperate, our foot all the while was ingaged on the left wing, to drive the Enemy from the hodges, where our men played their parts gal∣lantly, and drove them frō hedge to hedge by degrees, till they had forced them to the top of the hil, our horse doing little for the space of an hour after their retreat, only some parties incountring with each other, at which time our Noble Major Generall Brown (who was ever known to be a valiant man, and must be lookt upon as a speciall instru∣ment in the work, Drew off 100. men from the hedg∣es, and in his own person led them on to charge the horse, which they did most gladly and couragiously, and forced the enemies horse to wheele about, wherupon our body of horse came on again, and that very manfully, at which time they charghed quice thorow the Enemies body and put them to a rout, so that they were forced to retreat to the top of the hill, where they first appeared, this was a∣bout two of the clock in the afternoon, at which time they began to retreat, and sent their Carriages away, their body of foot followed after, the horse and some few foot onely being left to face and to fight with us, at the the last it pleased God to raise up the spirits of some few, not above 300. and to put such courage into them, as to adventure out of the closings, to charge the main body upon the plain, which they did so resolutely that they put them all to flight, our horse pursued them two miles at the least, till the Enemies horse overtook their own foot, who cryed out (as the country people say) Face them, face them, once more face them; which they did, but to small pur∣pose; our horse came up, and at the first charge they were all routed and fled, our horse pursued them till they overtook the foot, routed them likewise, and dispersed them severall waies, some fled to Ba∣sing,
some to Alton, and some to Winchester, and by the way they cryed out, the Kingdoms lost, the Kingdoms lost, &c. and when they left Alsford where they had long quartered, they set the town on fire at both ends, which doubtlesse had burnt to the ground, but that our men came in and put it out, there was onely four or five houses burnt. Thus it pleased God (who alone is the giver of all Vi∣ctory) to vouchsafe us not onely a deliverance (which we should have owned as a mercy) but a glorious conquest. As for the instruments, I dare not challenge any of neg∣lect in this dayes service, to speak the truth, both Horse and foot quit themselves bravely. We took prisoners in the fight; Sir Edward or Sir John Stowell, Major Gener: of a Brigade, a man of a great estate: Col: Beard, Colonell of a Regiment of Horse, and of a Regiment of Foot, who was imployed in Ireland: Lieut. Col: Kingston, Captain Price, Captain Chidleigh, Captain Jackson, Captain Seamer, Ensigne Cowper, Lieuten:  Ensigne Mellis, Ensigne Marsh; Ensigne Midley, Cornet Con∣stable, Cornet Ducket, John Morsey Physitian; Together with many other Captains and Commanders, besides cōmon Soldiers, the certain number I know not▪ whereas wee have not lost 40 men that wee know of; one of our men that was taken prisoner (but left behinde by reason of his wounds) told me himself, they had not taken 20 prisoners in all; and, I know not of 20 slain; the most con∣siderable losse on our part, is the Col: Tompson (a brave man) is shot with a Drake, and his Leg is cut off, we are in great hopes of his recovery; Major Boswell is desperatly wounded, Captain Melton is taken prisoner, some few are wounded, but I hope not mortally, the certain number of the slain I cannot report; they told us in Alsford, that they fetcht off cart-loads of dead men, and some they buried, and some they carryed with them, the Lord Iohn the Duke of Richmonds brother is slain, and Generall Ruthen as we are informed, though the Malignants are loath to part with such a Souldier, or to hear of his death, some say, he was not there; others say, he is escaped safe to
Reding; give me leave to tell the truth, I my self was at the house where he quartered at Alsford, the Master of the house testifies that he was there, and being troubled with the Gowt, went not into the field; in the morning, news was sent to him (doubtless it went to Oxford too, we may chance hear of a Thanksgiving for it) that the Londoners were routed, a thousand taken prisoners, the rest fled, and were then in the pursuit, welcome News no doubt; for presently he cals for a deck of Cards, and follows his sport, till at last a messenger in all hast tells him the tide was turn'd, their horse were routed, and his presence re∣quired; away he goes into the feild, and was saluted there by Leivtenant Colonell Bump, and so the game was ended, our great gunne cut him off, and he was brought dead to town: I could tell you of some others;  Captain left behinde in Alsford sorely wounded, doth r the Devil is in the Round-Heads they are such Fire∣men; they have slain, wounded, and taken Prisoners, all their Commanders of any note▪ if it be an untruth, or any Malig∣nant please to give it a grosser title, consider out of whose mouth it came; this for Friday. On Saturday morning I spake with the Mes∣senger, who came from Sir William Waller to our Major Generall with Orders, for we stayed at Alsford, 14 miles behinde Sir William Waller, who affirmed that the Horse and Foot were totally routed, not a body of 200 Foot to be found, of the great Army, consisting in all of twelve thousand, that we had taken seven peeces of Ordnance, many carriages, and that Sir William would set upon Winchester immediatly, being within a mile and a half of it then, I trust in God he is by this time possest of it. Many passages I am forced to omit for brevities sake, both in and after the fight: we had both the same word, God with us: but see what it is to dissemble with a God of truth. Our next word was, Iesus help us; so he did: and then the last was, Glory be to God. Give me leave to end here, and let this day be ever in our thoughts, and the word be ever in our mouths, a day wherein God was seen in the high places of the field, a wise, mighty wonder working God, there is not an Atheist that can own thee, and not acknowledge it to be digitus Dei; Tis God alone that hath done the work, to him alone be all the praise; The rest is this, March 30. 1644. Gentlemen, I am your humble servant, E. A. The Queens Regiment being there, and Prince Maurices forces; most of the Irish neither giving nor taking quarter. FINIS.
