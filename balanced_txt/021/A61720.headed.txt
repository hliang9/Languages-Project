THE EARLE OF STRAFFORDS SPEECH On the Scaffold. MY Lord Primate of Ireland, (and my Lords, and the rest of these Gentlemen) it is a very great comfort to me, to have your Lordship by me this day in re∣gard I have beene knowne to you a long time, I should bee very glad to obtaine so much silence, as to bee heard a few wordes, but I doubt I shall not, my Lord I come hi∣ther by the good will and pleasure of almighty God, to pay that last debt I owe to sin, which is death,
and by the blessing of that God to rise againe through the merits of Christ Jesus to eternall glory; I wish I had beene private, that I might have beene heard, my Lord, if I might be so much beholding to you that I might use a few wordes, I should take it for a very great Curtesie, my Lord I come hither to submit to that judgement which hath past against mee, I doe it with a very quiet and contented minde, I doe freely forgive all the world, a forgivenesse that is not spo∣ken from the teeth outward (as they say) but from the heart; I speake it in the presence of Almighty God, before whom I stand, that there is not so much as a displeasing thought in me arising to any Creature, I thanke God I may say truely, and my Conscience beares me witnesse, that in all my services since I have had the Honeur to serve his Majesty in any Employ∣ment, I never had any thing in my heart, but the joynt and individuall prosperity of King and People; if it have beene my hap to bee misconster'd, it is the common portion of us all while we are in this life, the righteous judgement is hereafter, here wee are subject to errour, and apt to bee misjudged one of an∣other; there is one thing I desire to cleere my selfe off; and I am very confident, I speake it with so much clearenesse, that I hope I shall have your Chri∣stian Charity in the beliefe of it, I did alwayes ever thinke the Parliaments of England, were the happi∣est Constitutions that any Kingdome, or any Nation lived under, and under God the meanes of making King and people happie, so farre have I beene from being against Parliaments; for my death J here ac∣quit all the world, and pray God heartilie to forgive them; and in particular, my Lord Primate I am ve∣rie glad that his Majestie is pleased to conceive mee, not meriting so severe, and heavie a punishment as the utmost execution of this sentence; I am very glad and infinitely rejoice in this mercy of his, and Beseech
God to turne it to him, that he may find mercy when hee hath most need of it; I wish this Kingdome all the prosperitie and happinesse in the world: I did it living, and now dying it is my wish, I doe now pro∣fesse it from my heart, and doe most humbly recom∣mend it unto every man here, and wish every man to lay his hand upon his heart, and consider seriously whither the beginnig of the happinesse of a people should be written in Letters of bloud, I feare you are in a wrong way, & I desire almightie God that no one drop of my bloud may rise up in judgment against you. (My Lord,) I professe my selfe a true and obedient Son to the Church of England, to that Church wherein I was borne, and wherein I was bred; prosperitie and happinesse, be ever to it: and whereas it hath been said that I have enclin'd to Popery, if it be an Objection worth answering, let me say truely, that from the time since I was one and twenty yeares of age, till this houre, now going upon nine and forty, I never had thought in my heart, to doubt of the truth of my Religion in England: and never any had the boldnesse to suggest to me the contrary, to the best of my remembrance; and so being reconciled to the mercies of Christ Jesus my Saviour, into whose bosome I hope shortly to be ga∣ther'd to enjoy those eternall happinesses that shall ne∣ver have end. I desire heartily the forgivenesse of e∣very man, both for any rash or unadvised word, or deed, and desire your Prayers: And so my Lords fare∣well, farewell all the things of this world, LORD strengthen my faith, give me confidence and assurance in the merits of Christ Iesus. I desire you that you would be silent and joyne in Praires with me; and I trust in GOD that we shall all meet and live eternally in Heaven, there to receive the accomplishment of all happinesse, where every teare shal be wiped from our eyes, and every sad thought from our hearts: And so GOD blesse this Kingdome, and Iesus have mercy upon my Soule. FINIS.
