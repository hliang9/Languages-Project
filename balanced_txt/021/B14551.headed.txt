O Lord our God, most gracious & most glorious, which after long patience of the former times of ignorance, in these last daies by the hande of thy faithfull seruants, the Magistrates & Ministers in diuers Countries, hast remooued the vineyarde of thy Church out of that spirituall Egipt, the kingdome of Antechrist, and hast planted it with most precious Vines, euen with sundry great & famous Chur∣ches in the Gospell of thy Sonne, which thou hast caused to take roote and to fill the earth, to spread theyr boughes at length, & theyr branches a farre off. Thou O Lord knowest, how since the very first beginning of this thy great worke, the wilde Boares of Rome, with other like mightie beasts of that fielde, haue by all meanes endeuoured to breake through the bounds, and to pull vppe the fences which with thine owne right hand thou haddest made for them: not onely to lay open their grapes, for all mens plucking, but also by destroying the Kéepers, vt∣terly to roote and turne vp thy whole vineyard. Specially at thys time thou sée∣est O Lord, how greatly thy enemies doo stirre, and how those that hate thée and thy Church, doo beare theyr heades aloft. For the Pope, and popish states of Italie, with Phillip of Spaine, the Duke of Parma, Sauoy, and Loraine, and the trayterous Leagors of Fraunce, haue all bended and confederate themselues a∣gainst thy people, plotting & counsayling together against thy secrete ones, how eyther by power or by trecherie they may destroy them, that there be no more a Church: and that from hencefoorth, the name of Protestants be not spoken of vpon earth. But thou O Lord God of our saluation, which sauest all those that retyre themselues vnder thy right hand, from such as rise vp against them: euen thou O God, our strength for thy promises, for thy truth, and thy sonne Christ Iesus sake, who by hys blood hath stablished a holy and euerlasting league be∣tweéene thee and thy people, as alwaies hetherto, so now much rather, helpe wée beséech thée the whole body of thy Church generally, and euery more special soci∣etie or member thereof: most specially by name, embrace we pray thée with thy principall defence, thy most noble Churches, thys of Englande and the other of France and in them thy two beloued seruaunts, chiefe heads and Gouernours of the same, Elizabeth our gracious Queene, and Henrie the most Christian King. As for theyr enemies, O Lorde, and the enemies of thy elect people, fill theyr faces with shame, dishonour, and rebuke, dooing vnto them as thou did∣dest of old time to the aduersaries of thy people Israell, euen to Pharao, Iabin, Sisera and Senacherib: and of late to the Duke of Guise and Maine in Fraunce, and the Spanish inuaders of our Land in the great déepe. So cast out all theyr counsailes O God, and cause them to perrish and be ouerthrowne: but let those that loue thée, be as the Sunne in the increase of his strength, to the vtter abash∣ment and astonishment of the wicked, to their occasionable enquirie after thy trueth, to the publique acknowledgement of thy iustice and power in the earth. And lastly to the stablishment of the thankfulnesse of the iust & the enlargement of thy praise in the mouthes of all thy Saints, through Iesus Christ our Lorde. To whom with thée the Father and the holy Ghost, one true eternall and euer liuing God, be all honour, praise, power & dominion, now and for euer. Amen.
