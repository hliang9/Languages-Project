The FRYER well Fitted; OR, A pretty Jest that once befell, How a Maid put a Fryer to cool in the Well. To a Merry Tune. AS I lay musing all alone, fa, la, la, la, la, A pritty jest I thought upon, fa, la, la, la, la, Then listen a while, and I will you tell, Of a Fryer that lov'd a bonny Lass well fa, la, la, la, la, fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly. He came to the Maid when she went to bed fa, la, &c. Desiring to have her Maiden-head, fa, la, &c. But she denyed his desire, And told him, that she fear'd Hell Fire; fa, la, &c. Tush (qd. the Fryer) thou needst not fa, la, &c. If thou wert in hell I could sing thee out doubt fa, la, &c. Then (qd. the maid) thou shalt have thy request, The Fryer was glad as a Fox in his nest fa, la, &c. But one thing (quoth she) I do desire, fa, la, &c. Before you have what you require, fa, la, &c. Before that you shall do the thing, An Angel of money thou shalt me bring, fa, la, &c. Tush (quoth the Fryer) we shall agree, fa, la, &c. No money shall part my Love and me; fa, la, &c. Before that I will see thee lack, I'le pawn my grey Gown from my back fa, la, &c. The Maid bethought her of a wile, fa, la, &c. How she the Fryer might beguile, fa, la, &c. While she was gone the truth to tell, She hung a Cloth before the Well; fa, la, la, la, la, fa, la, la, lang-tree-down-dilly.
THe Fryer came as his covenant was fa, la, &c. With money to his bonny Lass, fa, la, &c. Good morow fair Maid, good morrow, (qd. he) Here is the money I promised thee; fa, la, la, la, la, fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly. She thankt the man, & she took his mony fa, la, &c. Now let us go too't, (qd. he) sweet honey fa, la, &c. Oh stay (qd. she) some respite make, My Father comes he will me take; fa, la, &c. Alas (qd. the Fryer) where shall I run, fa, la, &c. To hide me till he be gone, fa, la, &c. Behind the Cloth run thou (qd. she) And there my Father cannot thee see, fa, la, &c. Behind the Cloth the Fryer crept, fa, la, &c. And into the Well on a sudden he leapt, fa, la, &c. Alas (quoth he) I am in the Well, No matte (qd. she) if thou wert in Hell; fa, la, &c. Thou say'st thou couldst sing me out of Hell, fa, la, &c. Now prithee sing thy self out of the well, fa, la, &c. The Fryer sung on with a pittiful sound, Oh help me out, or I shall be drown'd; fa, la, &c. I trow (quoth she) your courage is cool'd fa, la, &c. (Quoth the Fryer) I never was so fool'd, fa, fa, &c. I never was served so before, then take heed (qd. she) thou com'st there no more, fa, la, &c. (Quoth he) for sweet Saint Francis sake fa, la, &c. On his Disciple some pitty take, fa, la, &c. (Quoth she) Saint Francis never taught His Scholars to tempt young Maids to naught; fa, la, &c. The Fryer did intreat her still, fa, la, &c. That she would help him out of the well, fa, la, &c. She heard him make such piteous moan She help'd him out, and bid him be gone fa, la, &c. (Quoth he) shall I have my money again fa, la, &c. Which from me thou hast before-hand tane fa, la, &c. good sir (said she) there's no such matter, I'le make you pay for fouling my water, fa, la, &c. The Fryer went all along the Street, fa, la, &c. Dropping wet, like a new-wash'd Sheep fa, la, &c. Both old and young commended the Maid That such a witty prank had plaid, fa, la, la, la, la, fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly. Printed for W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger.
