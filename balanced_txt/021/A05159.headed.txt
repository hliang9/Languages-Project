Here begynneth the book whiche the knyght of the toure made / And speketh of many fayre ensamples and then∣sygnementys and techyng of his doughters Prologue IN the yere of oure lord a· M / thre honderd /  / as I was in a gardyn vnder a shadowe / as it were in thyssue of Aprylle / all moornyng and pensyf / But a lytel I reioysed me in the sowne and songe of the fowles sauuage / whiche songe in theyr langage / as the Merle / the Manys the thrustell / and the nyghtyngale / whiche were gay / and lusty / This swete songe enlustyed me / and made myn herte all temye / So that thenne I wente remembryng of the tyme passed in  youthe / How loue hadde holde me in that tyme in his seuye b grete distresse / In whiche I was many an houre gladde / and ioyeful / and many another tyme sorowful / lyke as it  to many a louer / But alle myn euylles aue rewarded me. Sythe that the fayre and good hath gyuen to me / whiche hath knowle∣che of alle honoure / alle good / and fayre mayntenyng / And of alle good she semed me the best and the floure· In whom I so moche me delytd / For in that tyme I made songes / layes. Roundels balades / Vyrelayes / and newe songes in the mooste best wyse I coude / But the deth. whiche spareth none hath taken her / For whome I haue receyued many sorowes and heuynesses In suche wyse that I haue passed my lyf more than twenty ye∣re heuy and sorowfull / For the very herte of a trewe louer shall neuer in ony tyme ne day forgete good loue / but euermore shal re¦membre it / And thus in that tyme as I was in a grete pensyf∣nes / and thought I beholde in the way / and sawe my doughters comyng / Of whome I hadde grete desyre that they shold torne to honoure aboue alle other thyng / For they ben yong & itil / & dys∣garnysshed of al wytte & reson / wherfor they ought at begynnyng to be taught & chastysed curtoisly by good ensamples & docerynes as dide a quene I suppose she was quene of hongry / whiche
fayre and swetely chastysed hel doughters / and them endoctry∣ned as is conteyned in her book / And therfor when I saw them come toward me / I remembryd me of the tyme when I was yōg and roode with my felauship and companyes in poytou / and in other places / And I remembre me moche wel of the fayttes and sayenges / that they told of suche thynges / as they fond with the ladyes and damoyselles / that they requyred and prayd of loue / And yf one wold not entende to theyr prayer / yet another wold requyre withoute abydyng / And though so were that they had good or euyll answers / of al that they rought not / For they had neyther dirde ne shame / so moche were they endurate and acusto¦med / And were moche wel bespoken / and had fayre langage For many tymes they wold haue oueral deduyte / And thus they  no thyng but deceyue good ladyes / and damoysellys. and be∣ ouerall the tydynges / somme trewe / and somme lesynges / Wherof there happed many tymes. iniuryes / and many vylayno∣ diffames withoute cause and withoute reason / And in alle the world is no gretter treson / than for to deceyue gentyll wym∣men / ne to encrece ony vylaynous blame / For many ben deceyued by the grete othes· that they vse / wherof I debate me oftyme with them. And saye to them / ye ouer false men / how may the god  suffre yow to lyue / that soo oftymes ye periure and forswere  sel / For ye hold no feythe / But none putt hit in araye / by  they be so moche and so ful of disaraye / And by cause I  that tyme soo ledde and disposed / yet I doute me that somme  suche in this tyme present / Therfore I concluded that I wold  make a lytel booke / wherin I wold doo be wreton the good maners and good dedes of good ladyes and wymmen / and of theyr lyues / soo that for theyr vertues and bountees they ben ho¦noured / And that after theyr dethe ben renommed and preysed and shal be vnto the ende of the worlde for to take of them good ensample and contenaunce / And also by the contrarye I shall doo wryte and set in a book the myshappe and vyces of euylle wym∣men / whiche haue vsyd theyr lyf / and now haue blame / To the ende / that the euylle maye bee eschewed· by whiche they myght erre / Whiche yet ben blamed / shamed / and dyf∣famed / And for this cause that I haue here sayd / I haue tho∣ught on my wel bylouyd doughers· whome I see so lytel to ma¦ke to them a litil book / for to lerne to rede / to thende that they maye
lerne and studye / & vnderstode the good and euylle that is pas∣syd / for to kepe them fro hym / whiche is yet to come / For suche ther be that lawgheth to fore yow / whiche after youre back goo mockyng and lyeng / Wherfor it is an hard thyng to knowe the world that is now present / And for these resons as I haue sayd I went oute of the gardyn / and fond in my weye two  and two clerkes that I hadde / and tolde to them· that I wolde make a book and an examplayre for my doughters to  and vnderstonde / how they ought to gouerne them  kepe them from euylle / And thenne I made them to  before me the book of the byble. the gestes of the kyng  of fraunce and of Englond / / and many other  historyes / and made them to rede euery book / And dyde doo mak of them this book. whiche I wold not set in ryme but al  in prose for to abredge / and also for the better to be vnderstonde And also for the grete loue that I haue to my doughters  I loue / as a fader ought to loue them / And thenne myn  shal haue parfyte ioye. yf they torne to good and to honoure  is to serue and loue god / and to haue the loue and the grace  neyghbours / and of the world / And by cause euery  moder after god and nature ought to teche & enforme their chil¦dren and to distourne them fro the euyll waye / and te shewe  them the right weye and true pathe / as wel for the saacion of theyr sowles / as for thonoure of the body  haue made two bookes / that one for my sonnes / and that ther for my doughters for to lerne to rede / And thus in lernynge  shalle not be / but that they shalle reteyne somme good ensample / or for to flee the euylle and reteyne the good. For it may not be but in somtyme they shal remembre somme good ensample or som good lore after that hit shalle falle / and come to theyr mynde in spekyng vpon this matere / Thus endeth the prologue Here foloweth the book of thensygnemens and techynges of the knyght of the Toure / And first how god ought to be honou¦red aboue all thynges / Capitulo primo
IT is moche fayre and ryght a noble thyng for to see and beholde thauncyent hystoryes / whiche haue ben wreton of oure predecessours / for to she∣we to vs good ensamples / and to aduertyse vs how we may see the good dedes· that they foo∣wed / and teschewe the euyll as may be sent / that they eschewed / Thenne I shalle speke / and saye to them thus / My ryght dere doughters for as moche as I am old / and  I haue sene the world more lenger than ye haue / I shall  to yow a partye of the world after my seyence / whiche is nt  grete / Bt the grete loue that I haue to yow / And the  I haue / that ye torne youre hertes and youre though  god / and to serue hym / by whiche ye may gete wele and  in this world and in that other / For certeynly al the  honoure / and al thoneste of man and of woman  and of the grace of his hooly spyryte / And also gyue  and shorte in worldly and erthely thynges / suche as  hym / For alle thyng falleth at his playsyre and  And also gyueth for all suche wele and seruyce as is  an honderd fold double / And therfore my right dere  is good to serue suche a lord. whiche rewarded an honderd  / How the matyns and houres ought to be said / Capitulo aNd by cause that the fyrst werke & labour that man or woman ought to doo / is for to adure and worshi¦pe oure lord / and saye his seruyse / That is to vnderstā¦de / that as soone as he awaketh / he ought to know leche hym for his lord and maker / and hym self to be his creature That is to wete· to saye his matyns / houres and his orysns▪ yf he be a clerk and to rendre and yelde to hym thankynges and ¦synges / As to say / laudate dominū omnes gencs Benedicamus patrem et filium cum sancto spiritu / or suche oer thynges as yel¦de & gyue thankynges & preysynges vnto god. For it is a gret¦ter thyng to thanke and blysse oure lord god / than to reuye & demaunde hym / For requeste / demaunde / yefte of guerdon & thn∣kynges / and to yelde preysynges is thffyce of angels▪ which al¦wey gyue thankynges / honoure / and preysyng vnto god / for it is
better to thanke god / than to requyre hym / by cause he knoweth better what is good for a man or a woman than they wote them self / After we ought to praye for them / that ben dede to fore we goo to slepe / And also the dede men praye for them / that praye for hem / And also forgete not the blessid and swete Vyr∣gyne Marye / whiche nyght and day prayeth for vs / And also to recommaunde yow to the hooly sayntes of heuen / And when this is done / thenne maye ye well goo slepe / For this ought to be done as ofte as ye awake Of twoo doughters of the Emperoure that one synfull And that other deuoute / Capitulo Tercio IT is conteyned in thystorye of Constantynople. that an Emperour hadde two doughters / Of whome the yongest was of good maners and loued god / and honoured & prayd to hym alwey when she awoke / and moche deuoutely pra¦ for the sowles of them that were dede / And these two yong  lay bothe in one bedde / And whan the oldest awoke / and  her suster saye her prayers / she mocked and scorned her /  said to her that she letred her to slepe / Thenne it happed that youthe and the grete ease that they hadde ben norysshed in /  them to loue two knyghtes bretheren / whiche were twoo goodly men and moche gentyll / And so long endured theyr play¦syre and loue that they discouered eche to her loue the secrete of the∣ir amerous desyre / in soo moche that they sett a certeyne houre to these knyghtes for to come to them pryuely by nyght / And when he that shold come to the yonger / supposyd to haue entryd within the Courteyns / hym semed that he sawe moo than a thousand men in sudaryes lyke dede men / whiche were aboute the damoysell he hadde so grete fere and hydoure. that he was al affrayed / Whe∣rof he tooke the feures / and was seke in his bedde / But to that other knyght if happed no thyng so. for he gate the oldest dough∣ter of the emperoure with child· And whan the Emperoure knewe that she was grete with child / he made her to be drowned in a nyʒt / & dyd do the knyʒt to be flayn al quyck. Thus for this false delyte they deyde both twen / But that other doughter was saued lyke as I haue said & shall saye / when it cam on the morn
it was said oueral / that the knyght was seke in his bedde / Thēne she for whome he tooke his maladye wente for to see hym / And he told to her all the trouthe / how when he supposid to haue entrid within the courteyns / he sawe a merueylous grete nombre of dede men in sudaryes / aboute her / Of whome he said / I had so grete dre¦de and hydoure / that I was taken with thaccesse or feures / and also was al moost oute of my wytte for fere / and yet am all af∣frayed / And when the damoysel herd the trouthe / she was merueylously ioyeful / and thanked god moche humbly / whiche  saued her fro perisshyng and dishonoure / And from than  on / she worshyped and prayed god alwey when she a  And praid moche deuoutely for all Crysten sowles more  fore / and kepte her chastly and clene / And it was  that a grete kyng of grece desyred and demaunded her  to haue her in maryage / And her fader gafe her to  was after a good lady and deuoute / and of moche  / Thus was she saued for prayeng to god / and  hym / and also for prayeng for them that ben dede / And  suster / that scorned and mocked her / was drwned and noured / And therfore my dere doughters remembre yow  this example alwey whan ye awake / And slepe not ageyne  that ye haue praid for them that ben departed oute of this  lyke as dyde the doughter of the emperour / And yet  wolde wel that ye shold knowe thensample of a Damoyselle whiche a greete lord wold haue for fayre or fowle for to accomplysshe his fowle playsyr and delyte How we ought to praye for them that ben dede Capitulo quarto IT happed in suche wyse / that this lord dyd do espye / where as this Damoyselle was entred in to an hoole where as she entrid & rested there for drede of hym / that was in a busshe / And she sayd vygylles for the dede men / And this grete lord entryd in to the hoole  And sawe her there / And wende anone to haue accomplyssyd his fowle delyte / But when he supposed to haue taken her / hym

al gentyl wymmen and noble maydens of good lygnage / ought to be softe / humble / Rype / stedfast of estate and of manere / of ly∣tel speche to answere curtoisly· and not to be ouer wyld to spryn¦ge ne le pe / ne cast her syght ouer lyghtely / For in lytel doyng ne cometh but good / For many haue lost their maryage for to she¦we them ouer moche / and to make ouer grete semblaunce. wher of oftymes were supposed other thynges in them / than euer we¦re done or thought / How the doughter of Aragon lost her maryage / Capitulo xiij I Wold that ye shold knowe how the doughter of the kyn¦ge of Aragon lost the kyng of spayne by her folye / It is conteyned in the gestys of spayne / that a kyng of Ara∣gon hadde two doughters / of whome the kyng of spayne wolde haue one / And for to chese her that best plesyd hym / he disguy∣sed hym self in the fourme of a seruaunt / And wente with his embassatours / that is to saye· his Messagyers / and with a bisshop and with two barons / And it is not to be demaunded / but that the kyng made to them grete honoure and ioye / The doughters of the kyng arrayed and attoured them the best wyse that they myght / And in especial the oldest / whiche thought that theyr comynge was for her / And so they were there in the Courte thre dayes for to see and behold the countenaunces / wherof it happed that in the mornyng whan they salewed them / the oldest answerd no thyng but bitwene her teeth / as she that was fyers and of grete porte But her suster was humble and ful of grete curtosye / and sale∣wed humbly the grete and smale / After he beld on a tyme that these two susters playd at tables with two knyghtes. but thol∣dest chyd with one of the knyghtes / And demened strongly foule chere. But the yonger suster / which had also lost made no semblāt of her losse / but made as good chere / as she had wonne / The kyng of spayne sawe and beheld al this / and drewe hym a part / and called his counceylle / and said to them / ye knowe wel that the kynges of fraunce ne of spayne ought not to marye them for co∣uetyse but nobly· and a woman of good maners wel born / and disposed to come to honoure / and to bere fruyte / And for as moche as I haue sene these two damoyselles· And haue by∣holden their maners and theyr guyses / me semeth that the yon∣gest is moost humble and moost curtois / and is not of so haul∣tayn courage / as is the oldest / And they answerd to hym /
Syre tholdest is more fayre / And he answerd to them / none hono∣ure / ne beaulte. ne none erthely good may compare to bounte ne to good maners / And in especial to humylyte / And by cause I ha∣ue sene her the more humble and the more curtoys / I wylle haue her / And thus chaas her / And thenne the bisshop and the barōs cam to the kyng of Aragon / and demaunded of hym the yonger doughter / Thenne the kyng and alle his peple were moche esmer¦ueyled that they took not the oldest / whiche was moost fayre / But thus it happed that the yonger was quene of spayne / by cause she was humble and softe of speche to greete and smale  her grete curtosye / wherof the oldest doughter had so grete desdayn & so grete despit yt she bycā al frātyke & frō her self & therfore this is a fayre ensample / how by curtosye and humylyte is goten the so¦ne of god and of the world / For there is no thyng so playsaunt as Humblesse curtosye· and to salewe fayre the peple grete and smale / and to make no chere of losse ne of wynnyng / For no gen¦tyl wymmen ought to make none effrayes in them / but ought to haue gentyl hertes and softe answers / And to be humble / For as god sayth in the gospel / he that is moost worthe and moos knoweth / moost humbleth hym / lyke as dyde the yonger dough¦ter of Aaragon / whiche for hir humylyte and curtosye conuerd to be quene of spayne / and took it fro hir older suster Of them that ben chydars or scoldes / capo. xiiii. fAyre doughters / see that ye begynne no strif to no foole / ne to them that ben hasty and hoote / For it is grete perill Wherof I shal shewe to you an Ensample / whiche I sa¦we happen in a Castel / wherin many ladyes & damoysls duelle den / And ther was a damoysell douʒter of a right gentyl knyʒt And she waxe angry in playeng atte tables with a gentylman / whiche was hoote and hasty and moost Ryotous / And was not right wyse / And the debate was of a dyes. whiche she saide was not truly made / And soo moche it encreaced that wordes were en¦haunced / and that she saide he was a coward and a foole. And so they lefte theyr playe by chydynge and strif / Thenne said I to the damoyselle / My fayre Cosyn / Angre you with no thyng. that he saith / For ye knowe wel / he is of haūtayn wordes & of folissh answers / wherfor I praye yow for your honour that ye take no debate ageynst hym / & I told her & coūceiled feithfully / as I wold haue said to my suster but she wold not bileue me / but yet did chi¦de more after this than to fore / And she sayd to hym that he was
nought worth· and many other wordes / And he answerd to her / that he was better for a man / than she was for a woman / & she said that he said not trouth / & soo the wordes aroos / that he said yf she had ben wyse and good / she shold not come by nyght in to the mennes chambres / and kysse them and embrace them without Candell / And she supposed well to haue auenged her / and sayd to hym that he lyed / And he said he dyde not / and that suche one & suche one had sene it / And there was moche peple / that herd hit / whiche knewe no thyng therof to fore / And many of them sayd / that a good stylle / and not so to haue chyden had ben better for her & that she was beten with her owne staf / that is to saye by her ton¦ge / and by hir hasty spekyng / And after these wordes she wepte and said that he had diffamed her / and that it shold not be left so And she reassayled hym to fore them alle in suche wyse / that he sa¦id yet more fowle and shameful wordes to the dishonoure of hyr that she shall neuer recouer for socoure that she can make / And thus was she shamed by the haultesse of her herte / And therfore this a good ensample / how no woman ought to chyde nestry∣ne ageynst a foole / ne with peple that haue haultayn courage / but they ought teschewe them / For whan they see that they wil speke grossely and hyghe / they sholde lete them alone· and holde them al styll / and saye to them / Fayr frende I see wel that ye spe¦ke hyhe and wylle ryotte / Now wylle I leue yow / and so depar¦te and goo fro hym / lyke as a knyght dyd to a lady that I kno∣we / whiche had an euylle heede / and saide many oultrages to the knyght to fore all the peple· To whome the knyght said / Madame yf it plesyth yow saye ye as many merueyles as ye wylle / And yf I here yow / I doo yow no wrong. I see well ye be maryed / wherof I am sory / But now for al that she wolde not be stylle / but chode more than to fore / And when the knyght sawe / that she wolde not leue ne be stylle for no thyng / he took a lytell wyspe of strawe that he fond / And set it to fore her / And saide to her Ma∣dame / yf ye chyde more / so chyde to this wyspe of strawe / / For I leue it here for me / And wente his way / and lefte hyr there / and it was reputed for wl done of the knyght / that soo lefte her / And she was holden for more foole than to fore. For when she fonde not / to whome she myght chyde / she restreyned her yf she wol¦de· And thus ought hit to be done / For hit is not honest ne good folke to stryue with fooles / ne to chydars· ne to suche as haue euylle heedes and ben hasty and hoote / but teschewe them lyke
as the knyght dyd this lady / of whome ye haue herd / Of her that ete the Eele and plumed her pye / Capitulo / xv / I Shall telle to yow an Ensample herof vpon the fayt of wymmen that ete the good morsels behynde theyr hus∣bondes / There was a damoyselle that had a pye in a cag whiche spak and said all that she sawe / And it happed that the lord of the hows made to kepe a grete Ele in a tronke in a  And he kepte it moche derworthely for to gyue it to som good lord of his / or to somme frende / yf they come to see hym / And it  that the lady saide to the Chamberere / that it were good to ete the grete ele / And they thought that they wold saye to theyr lord that theues had eten hym / And when the lord cam home  began to telle and saye to hym / My lady hath eten the Ele  when the lord herd this / he wente to his ponde / and fonde not  ele / And cam home to his wyf / and demaunded her what  befallen of his ele / And she supposed to haue excused her / A he said that he was acerteyned therof / And that the pye had  hym / And in the hous therfore was grete soowe and noyse / But when the lord was gone oute / the lady and the chamberee cam to the pye / and plucked of alle the fethers of his hede· saeng Thou hast discouered vs of the ele / and thus was the pure pe¦plumed and lost the fethers of his hede. But fro than fothn yf ony man cam in to that howe / that was balled or pylled or had an hyhe forhede / the pye wolde saye to them / ye haue told my lord of the ele / And therfore this is a good ensample / that no go¦od woman sholde not ete for hir lycorousnes the swete / or dey morsels withoute the wytyng of her husbōd· but yf she empld it well with honoure / This damoysell was after moe scorned & mocked for that ele by cause of the pye that so ofte remembryd  to suche as cam thyder so ballyd or pylled How wymmen ought not to be Ielous. Capitulo / xvj I Shall saye to yow an ensample of this euyl thyng Ialousye There was a damoyselle maryed to a suyer / whiche loued
so wel her husbond that she was Ielouse of all them that he spak to / wherfor her husbond blamed and repreuyd her ofte / but it auay¦led no thynge· And among al other she was Ielouse of a damoy∣selle of the Countrey whiche was of haultayn courage / And so it happed on a tyme / that she dyd chyde ageynst this damoyselle / And reproched her of her husbond· And that other said / that by her fayth / s̄he said not wel ne trouthe / And that other said that she lyed / And thus began they to fyght and smyte / eche other fyersly. And she that was accused tooke a staf / and smote that o∣ther on the nose suche a stroke / that she brack the bone / wherof she had euer after a croked nose / whiche is the moost syttyng membre that a man or woman may haue / as it that stondeth in the myd∣des of the vysage / So was this woman al blemysshed and bla∣med of her husband / and oftymes reproched / so that it had ben moche better for her not to haue ben Ielouse / and to haue kept her vysage hoole withoute blemysshe / And thus by the dysfyguryng of her nose and myschaunce / her husbond myght not loue her soo parfytely after / as he dyde to fore / as he was woned to doo / And other whyle took other / And thus lost she the loue and tho∣noure of her husbond by her Ielousye / and her folye / This is a right good ensample for al good ladyes and gentyl wymmen / how they ought to make semblaunt of suche thynges / and to suf∣fre fayre and curtoisly their sorowe yf they haue ony / Lyke as di∣de one myn Aūte. whiche hath told it me many tymes / This go∣od lady was lady of languyller / whiche thenne had a lord to her husbond. that myght wel / and held of rente for· xv· C. pound a yere & helde a merueylous noble estate / but her husbond was leche¦rous so moche / that he held alwey a woman or tweyne in his ho∣us / And oftymes he roos fro his wyf / and wente to his concuby¦nes / And when he cam fro his folye / he fond a candel lyght / and water with a towayll to wesshe his hondes / And when he was come ageyn she said no thyng / but praid hym to wesshe his hondes / And he said that he cam from the preuy chambre· And therfor said she by cause ye come fro thens / ye haue the more nede to wasshe yow / And otherwyse she repreuyd hym not / But som tyme she said to hym pryuely bitwene them bothe only / My lord I wote wel and knowe of youre fait with suche one and suche one / but neuer for me by goddes grace / sith that it is youre play∣sire / And that I can by no mene remedye it. I shal not make to yow the werse chere / ne semblaunt. ne to them also / For I were
wel a foole to breke my heede for the debate fo youre marchaun∣dise. sith it may be none other wyse / but I pray you my lord atte leste that ye make me no worse chere / ne that I lese not youre lo∣ue / ne your good semblaunt / For of the surplus I shall wel de¦porte and forbere / And shal suffre all that it shall playse yow to commaunde me / And truly by the softe and swete wordes that she said to hym / his herte malte / and wexe pytous / and kept hym self from it a good whyle. And duryng her lyf by grete curtosye and humble obeysaunce she vaynquysshth hym / For by other wey / she had neuer done it / And at the last he repentyd hym / and kepte hym only to her / This is a faire ensample / how by curtosye and obeysaunce a woman may best ouercome and withdraw her lord and husbond fro suche feet and dedes / and sonner than by ru¦desse / For a man is of suche courage / that when they be ronne n with fyersnes and rudesse / they done hit the rather / and ben  worse / And for so moche for to saye trouthe / and ryght / an hus∣bond ought not to conne his wyf maulgre / yf she be som what lons of hym / For the wise man saith that Ialousye is  of loue / And I trowe he saith sooth / For I shold not moche re∣che of suche one / as I set not by / and that I had no cause to loue whether he dyde wel or euyll / but of my neyghbour or of my fren¦de I shold be sory and heuy at my herte yf he had ony harme or di¦sease / And therfore Ielousye is not withoute grete loue / But h is in two maners / of whiche that one is werse than that other For it is in somme / in whome ben no good resons / And that is moche better to suffre for his honoure and for his estate / than for to haue it / And also a man ought to conne not ouermoche maul¦gre to his wyf / yf she be a lytell Ialouse ouer hym / For therby she sheweth how her herte doubteth and hath grete fere / that another haue not the loue that she ought to haue of ryght. after god and the chirche / but she that is wyse maketh lytell semblaunt / and she ought to refreyne her wel / and to bere her euyll curtoisly and con¦uertly / And in like wise ought a man to make as litell sembla¦unt as he maye / It is wisedom to hym that may kepe hym / but alweye the wif that seeth that her husbond be a lytell Ialouse of her. yf she apperceyue that she hath caused it of ony folissh plesaun¦ces / whiche plese hym not / the good wif thenne ought to deporte and forbere wisely withoute makyng semblaunt to fore ony / how she speketh or maketh ony chere by ony were / And ought to saye by twene them bothe wysely. and the moost swetely that she may
sayenge that she knoweth wel / that the grete loue that he hath to her / hath made hym to fere and doute that she turneth not her lo∣ue awey from hym / And to saye to hym that he haue no doute ne be not aferd / For by the grace of god she shalle kepe thonoure well of them bothe / And thus by fayre and softe wordes to meue / & take from hym & bryng hym fro his folissh Melancolye / For yf she take it in angre / and haue hyhe wordes she shalle enlumyne the fire and make it werse / and to make it werse than it was to fore. For many wymmen ben more fyers in theyr lesynges and lyes / than in theyr trewe sayenges and wordes / And therfore many haue grete doubte / And thus I saye yow that the good wyf how wel that she haue a lytel suspection of Ryotte or greef she ought not the lesse to loue her lord and husbond for a lytell Ie¦lousye / For she ought to thynke that is the right grete loue that she hath to hym / And how he hath grete doute and fere in his her¦te that another haue not the loue· that he ought to haue by his right after god and hooly chirche / And to thynke and beholde / that yf another withdrawe the loue / that he ought to haue / that neuer he shal loue her / and that the loue and the ioye of theyr maryage shold be lost / And theyr good and menage shold torne to declyne and faile fro day to day / And this is a thyng / that mo∣che peple ought to remembre and trxpresse oft in theyr mynde / And therfore this is a good ensample / how the courage & thought ought to be mesured How a good woman ought not to stryue with her husbond / Capitulo / xvij / aFter this a woman in no maner wyse ought stryue a∣geynst her husbond / ne answere hym so that he take ther∣by displaysyre / lyke as dyde the wyf of a burgeys whi∣che answerd to her husbond so noiously. and shamefully to fore the peple / that he bicam angry and felle to see hym self so rewlyd to fore the peple / that he had therof shame / And he said to her / and bad her ones or twyes / that she shold be stylle and leue / but she wold not / & her husbond whiche was wrothe smote her with his fyste to the erthe· And smote her with his foote on the vysage so that he brake her nose / by whiche she was euer after al disfygu¦red· And soo by her ryotte and ennoye she gate her a croked nose
moche euyll / It had ben moche better for her· that she had holden her stylle and hadde suffred / yet it is reson and ryght that the hus∣bonde haue the hyhe wordes / and it is but honoure to a good wo¦man to suffre and holde her in pees / and leue the haultayn lan∣gage to her husbond and lord / And it is in the contrarye to a woman grete shame and vylonye to stryue ageynst her hus∣bond be it wrong or right / And in especial to fore the peple / I say not / but when she shall fynd hym alone and tyme / but that she may wel reprehende hym and aduyse hym in shewyng curto¦ysly that he had wrong and vnright with hym / And yf he be a man resonable / he shal conne her thanke / And yf he be other  hath not she done but her parte / For right so shold a wyse  do / by th ensample of the wyse quene hester / wyf of the kyng As¦suere / whiche was moche melancolyque and hasty / But the  lady answerd not to his yre / But after when she sae hym  attempryd / place / and tyme / thenne dyde she what she  And it was grete wysedom of a woman / And thus ought  wymmen to do / By this ensample / the wymmen that ben  and rampynge ben not of suche obeysaunce / as was a  marchaunt / of whome I shall saye and telle to yow· How a woman sprange vpon the table· Capitulo xv IN a tyme it happed that Marchauntes of Fraunce cam from certayn Fayres / where as they sought Draer And as they cam with Marchaundyse fro Roan / that one of them said / it is a moche fayre thynge a man to haue a wif obeysaunt in alle thynges to her husbond / Verayly sayde that one / my wyf obeyeth me well / And the second said. I trowe / that my wyf obeye me better / ye sayd the thyrd / lede laye a wager / that whiche wyf of vs thre that obeyeth best her husbond / and doeth sonnest his commaundement that he wynne the wager / whe¦rupon they waged a Iewele / and accorded al thre to the same & sworen that none shold aduertyse his wyf of this bargayn / sau only to saye to her / doo that whiche I shall commaunde what sō∣euer it be / After when they cam to the first mans hows / he sayd to his wyf Sprynge in to this bacyne / and she answerd / wherfore or what nede is it. And he said by cause it playsth me so / and I wyll that thou do so / Truly said she I shall knowe fyrst wherfor
I shal sprynge / And soo she wold not doo it· And her husbond waxe moche angry and felle / and gafe her a buffet / After thys they cam to the second mrachauntes hows / and he saide to his wyf lyke as that other saide / that she wold doo his commaunde∣ment / And it was not long after that he said to her / Sprynge in to the basyn / And she demaunded hym wherfore / And at the last ende for ought that he dyde / she dyd it not / wherfore she was be∣ten as that other was / Thenne cam they to the thyrd mans hous And there was the table couered· and mete set theron And the marchaunt said to thother marchauntes in theyr errs / that after dyner he wold commaunde her to sprynge in to the bacyn / And the husbond said to his wyf / that what someuer he commaunded her she shold do it / his wyf whiche that moche louyd hym and dred hym herd wel the word. And it was so that they bygan to ete / and there was no salt vpon the table / And the good man sayd to his wyf / Sail sur table And the good wyf whiche hadde fere to disobeye hym / sprang vpon the table and ouerthrewe table / me¦te / wyn / and platers to the ground / How said the good man / is this the manere / Cōne ye none other playe but this / are ye mad or oute of youre wyt. Syre said she / I haue done youre commaū¦dement / haue ye not said that youre commaundement shold be do∣ne what someuer it was. Certaynly I haue it done to my power how be it that it is youre harme and hurte as moche as myn.

For moyen peple chastysen theyr wynes by buffettys and strokes / but gentyl wym¦men ought to be chastysed by fayre semblaunt and by curtosye  For other wyse ought not to be done to them.

And the other had to name Zaram. wherfor many tribulacions and euylls befelle afterward For the children that ben not of trewe maryage / they be they by whome the grete herytages and Auncestri ben loste / wherof I shalle telle you an Ensample of a kynge of Naples / as it is conteyned in the Cronycles of that lond / There was somtyme a quene of that lōd whiche clenly ne truly kepte her body toward her lord / in so moche she gate a sone by another than her lord / It befelle after∣ward / that this sone was made kynge of the lond / after the dethe of the kynge / This newe kynge was passynge prowde and loued not his lordis ne barons but was to them full hard and felon & also to al his comyns he was vnresonable / For he took fro them all that he couthe / And enforced their wyues / and vyoled their doughters / And vsed all euyl dedes / whiche he couthe ymagyne to doo / He bigan werre to his neyghbours and to his Barons in so moche that alle the reame was put in exyle and brought to grete pouerte. whiche longe tyme lasted / In that tyme was ther a Baron a good man and a right good knyght / whiche went vn¦to an Heremytage / where as was an hooly heremyte moche rely∣gious / And that many thynges knewe· The knyght demaunded and asked of hym how and wherfore they had so long warre in the lond And yf it shold yet last long tyme / And the hooly Here myte answerd hym. Sire it is cōuenyent that the tyme haue his cours / that is to saye that as long as this kynge and one his so∣ne shalle be on lyue the tribulacion shalle not cesse / And I shall telle yow why / trouthe it is that this kyng that now regneth is not trewe heyr to the Crowne / but is borne in aduoultrye / And therfore he may not be peasyble to the reame ne haue the Ioysaū∣ce of it / wherfore he and his reame must haue sorowe and tribu∣lacion / as long as a fals heyr / shall possesse it / But his sone shal haue none heyr / And so shalle fynysshe the fals lygnee and shall
the reame come ageyne to the right heyre / And thenne shalle las∣se the pestylence and pees shalle be / And al haboundaunce of goo¦des shalle come to the reame / Ryght so as the good Heremyte had saide. so it befelle. He said more ouer / For he spak of the fals que¦ne / and said she shold be punysshed in this world & that the wyf of the kynge her sone shold accuse her toward her lord / And hou she shold lye with one of her preestes / and that the kynge her so∣ne sholde fynde hem to geder / and how both / he shold do to be brent in a grete fornais / And all this befelle afterwarde as he said / For in certeyne the quene was destroyed and brente by the com∣maundement of the kyng her sone / And therfore my good dough¦ters a noble thyng is to kepe hym self clenly in his maryage / And for a fals heyre ofte cometh in a lond many euyls and tri¦bulacions / For by the fals heyres ben lost the grete lordshipes / & the moders of them dampned perpetuelly in helle as longe as their sones shalle possesse ony groūd of theyr parastre / that is to say of their moders husbond Of Ioseph that wold not haue the companye of the quene Capitulo lviij fAyre doughters I shalle telle yow an Ensample of a grete euylle that came by lokynge and folysshe plaisaun∣ce. It is of Ioseph the sone of Iacob / he that was sold by his bretheren to the kyng Pharaon / This Ioseph was of merueylous beaute wyse and right humble / And for his good seruyse the kyng loued hym moche and gafe hym baundon ouer all the goodes that were in his reame. The quene that sawe hym so faire gentyll meke and curteys was soone merueylously ena∣moured of hym. And shewed hym many signes and tokenes of loue in beholdynge and lokynge on hym / And when the quene sa¦we that for ony thyng that she couthe doo / he wolde not consent to her euyll wyll / she was sore troubled and nyghe oute of her wit At the last she called hym and hadde hym alone with her in a chambre / and ther she preid hym of loue / But he that was good and honest answerd to her / that he neuer sholde be suche a traitoure to his lorde / And thenne she with hir fyst tooke hym fast by the mantell and bigan to crye as lowde and hyghe as she myght. in so moche alle came thyder / She saide to the lord that he wolde haue
haue forced her / And forthwith the lord made hym to be take / & put in a pryson / whiche was right derke & obscure / where he was a long space of tyme / But afterward god that wold not forgete hym for his vertue and goodnes delyuerd hym oute of pryson / And was gretter mayster than he was before in the reame and more better loued and honoured / And therfore is here a good en¦sample / For god enhaunceth euer the Iuste and trewe / And the fals quene was punysshed. for within a lytell tyme after she dei∣de vylaynsly / and sodenly of an euylle deth / & so god rewarded eche of them after their deserte and meryte / Therfore is here a fa∣ire ensample to doo wel / For of good delyng and of good guy∣dynge cam neuer but worship and honoure / And as saith theuā¦gelyst / there is no good dede done but it shalle be remembryd & rewarded / Ne also none euylle dede done but that it shalle be pu∣nysshed / Therfore getynge of fals heyres is grete sorowe and tribulacion to come in a land where as they become lordes of / wher¦fore the moders of them shalle be delyuerd to the dolorous deth of helle / wheroute they shalle neuer yssue / as long as their children bastardys shall hold ony of the lond and goodes of their husbon¦des / And alle this is very trouth as wytnesseth many that ben suscited ageyne / and so doth the hooly scripture also Of the doughters of Moab / of whom the euyll lygnee yssued Capitulo lix / aNother ensample I shalle telle yow of the euylle wym∣men that were in tyme passed / how the doughters of Mo∣ab were falsely engendryd and goten / And ageynst the lawe· And comynly of an euylle or bad tree yssueth bad & euylle fruyte / For these doughters were fooles and ful of lechery / wher¦fore it bifelle that balam whiche was a paynym for to doo gryef to the hoost of the sones of Israel / dyde do make these doughters queynt and Ioly and wel arayed of ryche clothes and with preci¦ous stones / And sente them in the said hoost of the Hebreux whi¦che were al folke of god to thende he sholde make them to falle in synne with them / And that their god sholde caste therfore his yre vpon them / Thenne cam these coynted and Ioly doughters in to the hoost of the Iewes / of whome many of them as they saw
the beaute of them / were sore tempted / and so esprysed of theyr loue / that at the last they tooke and had theyr delyte and plaisaū¦ce with them / wherfore the prynces of the hoost made no sembla∣unt / but god was therfore angry vpon them / And commaunded to Moyses that the prynces of the hoost that suche inyquyte hadde susteyned and made sholde be hanged. and put to deth / Wherfore Moyses made anone to knowe thorugh oute all the hoost the co∣maundement of god / whiche sone after was accomplysshed / and many one put to deth for the forsaid fowle dede and inyquyte / Here is a good ensample for the prynces and Capytayns of hoostes that suffren many force and vyolence to be done / and that suffren a grete nombre of harlottes within their hoost / wel maye they see how suche thynges displeasen god the fader / that wold take vengeaunce of the capitaynes of the Iewes hoost / Of the Iewe & of the paynym / that were broched with aswerd Capitulo lx / I Shalle telle yow another Ensample that befelle another tyme in the said hoost of the sones of Israell / that is to wyte. the Iewes that were people of god / and that kepte his lawes / Now it befelle that the doughter of Madyan whiche was a paynym was so sore tempted that she coynted and arrayed her in the best wyse she couthe / And thenne cam in to the hoost of Ebreus / She was coynt and Ioly and right richely and nobly arayd / And dyde come thyder only for hors and harnois that is to wete / to accomplisshe her fowle delyte. She cam so ferre in to the hoost that a knyght one of the lordes of the hoost espyed her and sawe her / the whiche was lyghtely tempted and surpry∣sed of her loue / in so moche he dyde made her to come in to his tene and lodgynge and tooke his delyte with her / And hit haped thenne as it plesyd god that one of the moost Chyuetayns and lord of the hoost knewe and perceyued this fowle dede. And be in contynent cam there / as they were yet nyghe to geder / and broched and put his swerde thorugh bothe the bodyes of them / And soo lothe they deyde there vylaynsly by the synne of lechery / The knyght was named Sambry / and was of the lygnage of Sy∣meon that was of the twelue prynces of their lawe / And yet neuertheles he was not spared. For the prynces and chyuetayns
of the hoost that sawe how god wrought for them that euery day were fyghtyng ageynst as many mo as they were / And that all the vyctoryes yt they had / they had them thorow the myʒt of god whiche wold spare no man / but dyde good Iustyce to euery man what someuer he had be / For it was nother ryght neither reson / that their folke shold lye with them of other lawe / as the Cri∣sten folke with the Iewes and sarasyns / And so they helde and kepte them self clenly as moche for fere of their prynces / as for the loue of god. And god gaue hem vyctory and warauntyssed them / And for certeyne the thyng that god kepeth / shalle neuer be hurted ne domaged in no wyse / Now may ye see how god hateth the synne and dede of lechery / And how he wylle that men be pu¦nysshed of it How none ought to abyde allone in a place with another alone Capitulo lxj yEt my dere doughters I shalle telle you another ensam¦ple / how men ought not to abyde alone with another al one / all be he of his parente / his affynyte or other For ye shall here how it befelle to thamar the doughter of kynge Dauyd to whome her broder tooke awey her maydenhede / This Amon was tempted ageynst god and ageynste the lawe / And for to accomplysshe his euylle wylle / fayned hym self to be seke. and made his suster to serue and kepe hym. He euer loked on her of a waunton and fals regard / and kyssed and embraced her / And so moche he made lytell and lytell that he chaffed hym so that he depuceled her / that is to say / he tooke her maydenhede fro her / And when Absolon hir broder of fader and moder wyst and knewe it al moost he wexe woode for yre and anger / He slewe his broder Amon that suche desloyalte and vntrouth had done to his suster And therof cam many tribulacions and euyls / And therfore here is a faire Ensample / For euery woman that clenly wylle kepe honoure and worship ought not to abyde alo∣ne with a man alone withoute it be with her lord / with her fader or with her sone / and not with ony other / For many euyls & temp¦tacions ben therof come / Of the whiche yf I wold I shold reher¦ce you of many of them / to whome as men saie is euyll happed & also by their nygh parentes / Therfore it is grete perylle to trust in

good knyʒtes in armes / for euer they vyaged & neuer rested tylle they came in place where they myght essaye and preue the strengthe of theyr bodyes for to gete worship and good re¦nomme / And so moche they dyd by theyr valyaunce / that at the last they were renommed ouer al / as charny and bouchy∣kault were in theyr tyme / And therfor they were byleuyd and herd before all other as knyghtes auctorysed and renommed How thauncyent were wonte to lerne the yonge / Capitulo Cxv Herfore hit became that yf they sawe a yonge man of age make ony thyng that dyd ageynst his honour they shewed hym his fawte before the folke / And ther¦for the yong men dradde them moche / For thenne as I herd sa¦ye to my lord my fader / how a yonge man cam to a feste where were many lordes ladyes and damoysels / and rrayed as they wold haue sette them to dyner / and had on hem a cooe hardye after the maner of almayne / He cam and salewed the lordes and ladyes / And whanne he had done to them reueren∣ce / the forsayd Syre Geffroy called hym before hym / and de∣maunded hym where his vyell or clauycordes were / and that he shold make his craft / And the yonge man ansuerd / Syre I can not medle therwith / Ha a sayd the knyght / I can not byleue it / For ye be contrefaytted and clothed lyke a mynys∣trell / Neuertheles I knowe well your auncestrye and the go∣od and trewe men of the towre / of the whiche ye be come of / But in good faythe I sawe neuer none of your lygnage / that wol̄de haue contrefayted hym ne also be clothed of suche gowne as ye be / And thenne he ansuerd to the knyght ageyn Syth that my clothynge semeth to yow lothely and dishoneste hit shalle be amended / Thenne he called to hym a mynystrell & gaf hym his gowne / and toke another / and came ageyne to the halle / And whan the good & auncyent knyght sawe hym he sayd / trewely this yonge man forueyeth not / For he byle∣ueth the counceylle of his older / And euery yonge man and
yonge wymmen whiche byleue the counceylle of thauncyent & good folke may not faylle to come to honour and worshyp / And therfore is here a good ensample / how none ought to by¦leue / and not to haue shame ne vergoyne of the techynge of the wyse men and more auncyent than he is / For that whiche they saye and techen they done it not but for good / But the yonge men and wymmen that ben at this day take to thys no hede / but haue grete despyte whanne they be repreued of theyr wyckednes and folye / and wene to be more wyse than the olde and auncyent folke / It is grete pyte thenne of suche vn∣knowlege / For euery gentylle herte and of honeste lyuynge oughte to haue grete Ioye whan he is repreued of his fawte and mysdede / and yf he be wyse and sage / he shalle thanke hym / by whome he knoweth his fawte / And in this is shewen and perceyued the free kynd of the good yonge man & yong woman / For no chorlysshe nor vylayne herte shall neuer yeue thanke ne graces of it / Now haue I told to yow how thaun∣cyent spake and chastysed the yong men / And now I shalle telle yow how they gaf good ensamples to the good ladyes & damoysels that were at that tyme How hit was wonte to departe the blamed and dyffamed women fro the felauship & companye of the good and trewe / Capitulo Cxvj IN tho dayes was the tyme of pees / and were holden grete festes and reueyls / and al maner of knyghtes and ladyes and damoysels gadred and assembled to gyder where as they wyst that ony feste was kepte and hol∣den / And there they cam with grete worship / and wyth them came the good knyghtes of that tyme / but yf hit happed by somme aduēture / that ony lady or damoysell yt had euyl name or were blamed of her honour put her self / and wente byfore another of good renōme / how be hit that she were more gentyl and more noble and more Ryche / yet notwithstondynge the good and auncyent knyghtes had no shame to come to them
before euery one / ne to telle thus to them / lady or damoysel be not yow displesyd yf this lady go before yow / for how it be so that she be not so noble ne so ryche as ye be / neuertheles she is not blamed / and hath good Renommee / and is put among the nombre of the good wymmen / And thus it is not sayd of yow wherfore me displeaseth moche / but worship and hono∣ur shalle be borne to them that be worthy / and haue deserued it / And therfore be not yow meruaylled / Thus and in lyke wyse spake that tyme the good and auncyent knyghtes and put them of good Renommee the fyrst and formest / wherof they thanked god that had gyue them grace to kepe & hold them clenely / wherby they were sette bifore the other and wor¦shipped ouer al / And the other tooke them self by the nose castynge theyr faces dounward / and receyued moch shame & vergoyne / And therfore was this a good ensample to al wym¦men / For by the grete repreef and shame that they herd saye & talke of the other / they doubted & drad ony thynge / to do that was amys / of whiche they myght be blamed as the other we¦re / But certaynly now vppn this daye men bere as grete wor∣ship to them that ben blamed as to the good and trewe / whe∣rof many one taketh euylle ensample / and saye / I see that men bere as grete honoure to them / whiche shold be blamed and dyffamed / as they do to the honest and trewe / it is no force to doo euylle / al thynge passeth forth awey / but neuertheles it is euylle sayd / For in good feythe how be it that they wene to eyue honour and worship of them that be wyth them / whane they be departed they mocke and scorne with them / sayenge one to other / Suche one is full curtoys of her body / su∣che a man taketh his disporte with her / And thus somme ma∣ken good chere and beren honour before them / and behynd the∣yr backes they pulle oute theyr tongues in scornynge of them But the folysshe wymmen perceyue them not / but Ioyen them self in theyr folye / and wene that none knowe theyr fawte & shame / Thus is the tyme chaunged otherwyse than hit was wonte to be / wherfore hit is damage and grete pyte / For hit were best that of theyr fawte and blame they were reproued before al as they were at that tyme / Yet more I shalle telle
yow / as I haue herd reherced of many knyghtes whiche saw and knewe the sayd Syre Geffroy de lyege / how that as he rode thorugh the Countrey / and as he aspyed and sawe some place or manoyr / he demaunded and asked the / place / and yf he vnderstode by ony maner that the lady of the manoyr or pla¦ce were blamed of her honour and worship / he shold haue go¦ne oute of his ryght way / Rather than he had not gone to the yate of the same place / and make there a faytte and put and sette his signes ageynste the yate / And thenne rode ageyne in to his ryght way / And contrary to this dede / yf hit happed to hym to passe before the place of a good and Renommed la∣dy or damoyselle / al had he neuer so grete haste / he wente to see her / And sayd to her my good Frende / other my lady / or els damoysell / I praye to god that in this welthe and honoure he wylle euer hold and mayntene yow in to the nombre of the good wymmen / For wel ye oughte to be preysed and wor∣shipped / And thus by this maner and way the good wym∣men drad and held them more sure fro doynge ony thynge / wherby they myght lese theyr worship and honoure / wherfore I wold that tyme were come ageyne / For as I wene many one shold not be blamed and diffamed as they be now / How before this tyme men punysshed them that were diffa¦med Capitulo Cxvij wHerfore yf the wymmen recorded and thought the ty¦me past before the comynge of Cryst / whiche lasted mo¦re than fyue thousand yere / And how the badde and euylle wymmen / specially they that were wedded were punys∣shed / as they mysgyded them / For yf it myght be proued on∣ly by two men that they had had companye or carnal felau∣ship with ony other than to theyr lord / she was brente eyther stoned with stones / And for no gold ne syluer she myghte be saued al were she neuer so noble / after the lawe of god and of Moyses / And yet I ne knowe but fewe Reames this day sanf the Reame of Fraunce and of Englond / and in the lo∣we

woman / For she that is clene and withoute tatche / that is to saye / she that is not wedded that kepeth her vyrgynyte & chas∣tyte / And also she that is wedded whiche kepeth and holdeth her self clenely in the holy sacramente of maryage / and not suffreth her self to be shamed of her spouse / the whiche god hath destyned and gyuen to her / Also she that kepeth wel and cle∣nely her wydowhede / These be tho / as the glose seyth / of whome god spake in his holy euuangely / These be lykened and com¦pared as sayd our lord to the precious margaryte whiche is euer bryght and clene withoute ony macule or tatche / For as sayth the holy scrypture nothynge is so agreable to god and to his Angels as a good woman / and in a parte god preyseth more her than the man / And by reason she ought to haue more meryte / by cause she is of lyghter courage than the man is / that is to saye that the woman was fourmed and made out of the mans body / And in so moche that she is more feble than the man is / And yf she resisteth ageynste the temptacions of the deuylle / of the world / and of the flesshe / the more she is worthy to haue gretter meryte than the man / And therfor god compareth her to the precious margaryte / whiche is bryght and clene / Also saith the glose in another place / that as it is a foul thynge to spylle droppes of ynke in to a dysshe ful of mylke / Ryght so is of her that ought to be a good mayd whanne she spylleth and gyueth her maydenhede to another than to her spou¦se / And also is of her whiche is wedded that of her falshede & fowle lecherye breketh and spylleth her holy sacrament of ma∣ryage and forswereth her feythe and her lawe toward God and the chirche / and toward her lord also / Also she whiche oughte to bere her self clenely in her wydowhede and that doth the contrarye / This maner of wymmen be lyke the black tat∣ches that ben vpon the whyte mylke and vpon the whyte co∣uerchyef / they be lyke in no thyng to the precious Margaryte For in the precious margaryte is no maner of tatche / Allas a woman ought wel to hate her self / and to curse her euyll lyf whanne she is put oute of the nombre of the good and trewe women / Thenne yf they remembred wel them self of thre thyn¦ges / the fyrste is how they that be not yet wedded lese theyre maryage and theyr honour and acquere the shame and hate
of theyr parentes and frendes and of the world / And how euery one shewe them with the fynger / Secondly / how they that ben wedded lese al worship and the loue of god / and of theyr lordes / of theyr frendes and of al other / for god letteth them to haue ony welthe or cheuaunce / And to long were the fowle and euylle talkynge whiche is sayd of them / to be re∣herced / For somme shall do to them good chere before them / but behynd them / they shalle hold theyr talkynge scornyng & moc¦kyng them / And neuer after they shalle loue theyr lord / For the deuyll shalle make them as brennynge and to haue more delyte in that dampnable synne of fornycacion / than in the de∣de of maryage / For in the dede of maryage is no mortall syn∣ne / for it is an operacion commaunded of god / And therfore the deuylle hath nothynge to doo of hit / but in puterye and in synne mortalle or dedely he hath grete power / and is there in his persone to chauffe and meue the synnar to the fals delyte / as the smyth / whiche putteth the cole in the fornays / and then∣ne he bloweth and kyndeleth hit / And soo moche wayteth the deuylle to serue them wel in that fowle delyte / and to kepe them stylle therin / that at the last he caryeth and bereth wyth hym theyr soules in to the depe pytte of helle / wherof he taketh as grete Ioye / and holdeth hym therof as wel apayed / as doth he that al the day hath chaced and atte euen he taketh the best and hath it with hym / And in lyke wyse dothe the deuyll of al suche men and wymmen as rayson is / For the holy wry¦tynge sayth / they that ben chauffed and brennynge in the fyre of lecherye / shalle be brente in the fyre of helle / And it is well reson as a good heremyte sayth in vitas patrum / that one hete be put with the other / for as god sayth / there is no good dede done / but that it shalle be guerdonned / Ne none euylle done / but that it shal be punysshed / How the doughter of a knyght lost her maryage Capitulo Cxix I Shalle telle yow another Ensample of the doughter of a noble knyght / that loste her maryage by her coynted

How Cathonet exposed his auenture or hap / Capitulo xliiij nOw haue ye herd how it is happed to me / by cause I dyd not byleue the counceylle of my Fader / whiche was so trewe and wyse a man / To me therfore is co¦me almost a grete euylle / And notwithstondynge thus sayd Cathonet to themperour / Syre I rendre and discharge me of your offyce / And from hensforth I shalle not be eneched of hit / And he therof was discharged with grete payne  Neuetheles he was receyued for to be mayster of the grete  of Rome / And in especiall of the grete fayttes and dedes  And themperour made hym to haue grete prouffitees / and  hym grete yeftes / and loued hym aboue al other / And  moche holyly in the loue of god and of the peple /  therfore my fayre doughters this is here a good ensam how ye ought to kepe the counceyll of your lord / and not  it to no body what someuer it be / For ofte comen therof  euyls / and for to be secrete / and specially in suche thyng  is deffended / may not come sauf only good / And in lyke  as the shafte is departed fro the bowe must take her flyg and cours / and neuer cometh ageyne to the bowe / tyll it hau smyte somme thynge / Soo is the word whiche yssued oute of the mouthe lyke it / For after that he is put out of the mou it may neuer be put in to the mouthe ageyne / but that it shal be herd be it good or euylle / wherfor we ought wel to haue  our memorye the saynges and auctorytees of the wyse S¦lamon / whiche sayth that men must thynke on the wordes twy¦es or thryes or they be putt oute of the mouthe / And thus ought to doo al wyse folke / For ouer many grete euyls haue ben done and engendered for to haue discouered the counceyll and suche thynges as haue ben sayd there in counceylle / Therfore I pray yow fayr doughters that ye wylle haue this ensample in your memory and neuer forgete it / For all good and worship may therof come to yow / And hir is a vertue the whiche escheweth grete hate and grete enuye and many euyls also / For many one I knowe whiche haue loste moche of theyr goodes / & suffred many grete euyls for to haue spoke
to lyghtely of other / and for to haue reported suche wordes as they herd saye / of the whiche they had nought to doo at al For none soo wyse is that may knowe what to hym is to co∣me / And full of naturel wytte be they / whiche kepe them self fro recordynge of ony wordes / For he whiche wythsayeth them that blameth other as wel in ryght as in wronge / he doth but wel / And for to hold and kepe secretely the dommage and euylle of other may come but good / as hit is reherced in the booke of my two sonnes And also in an Euangely Here fynysshed the booke / whiche the knyght of the Toure ma∣de to the enseygnement and techyng of his doughters transla¦ted oute of Frenssh in to our maternall Englysshe tongue by me William Caxton / whiche book was ended & fynysshed the fyrst day of Iuyn / the yere of oure lord MCCCClxxxiij And enprynted at westmynstre the last day of Ianyuer the fyrst yere of the regne of kynge Rychard the thyrd
