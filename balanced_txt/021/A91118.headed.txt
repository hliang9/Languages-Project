A Testimony of God, And his way, and worship against all the false wayes and worships of the VVorld. Also an answer to some of the false Doctrines held forth, by a professed Minister, in VVales; shewing the unsoundness of his former actions, and is found to be one, in the nature of the VVorld; which sometime he hath spoken against. WITH An answer to some Queries; propounded by one, who is called an Anabaptist. Given forth for no other end, but in love to the truth, as it is in Iesus: BY ALEX: PARKER. LONDEN, Printed for Giles Calvert, at the West end of Pauls, 1656.
A Testimony of God, and his way, and worship, against all the false wayes and worship of the world. GOD is pure and holy, and loves righteous∣ness, and his worship is a pure and a spiritual worship, not known to the world that lives in wickedness: the world by all their wisdom and study cannot find out the mind of God, neither do they worship him in spirit, but are wondering and worshipping the Beast, who have not found their names written in the book of life, and though they make a profession of the name of God, yet are aliens and strangers from the pure life and power of God, and so are climbing up another way and building up Babel, (a Tower to reach up to Heaven in their Heathenish and Babilonish wisdom) where there is nothing but confusion and strife, one crying lo here is Christ, another crying lo there, one crying up his way to be the onely way, and counts all accursed that are not in his way, and so the second cries up his way, and so all the world lies in confusion and wickednesse, strife and debate, and though many have long been seeking after God, yet have not found him, because they sought him not in his own
way. Which is pure for ever; but by their own wit and wisdom have gone about to know and find out the mistery of the King∣dom of God, & so have walked & gone on in the crooked wayes, and by paths of the world, and have despised that little thing within, which is the light of Jesus that shines in the midst of all this darkness, and reproves them in secret for their evil deeds, and shews them their confusion, and oftentimes bring them to a stand, and some sense or feeling of the deadness and emptiness of all their profession, and of their tottering building which is builded upon the sand, and cannot stand in the fiery day of the fierce wrath and indignation of God, and when they daub up them∣selves with smooth words, crying the ordinances of Christ, and the Church of Christ, and the righteousness of Christ, and faith in Christ, and though they be wicked and sinfull, and must be so while they live, yet Christ doth not impute their sin unto them, they are justified in Christ, though they sometime run in∣to sin, and thus would make Christ a cloak for their sin: yet still the light of Christ testifies against them, and all their colour∣ed and painted outside, and talking of justification, without holi∣ness of life, will not bring them peace, but still there is a cry af∣ter God for purity, and reproves them for their sin and iniquity, and no peace there is to the wicked, as long as they act contrary to the measure of God, all their profession and high notions, and glorious comprehensions and guilded outsides, is but like unto Adams fig-leafe garment, and will not cover their nakednesse in the dreadfull and powerfull day of the Lord, the wicked shall be as the stuble, and shall be consumed root and branch, all their crying Lord, Lord, will not avail them in that day, all their ser∣mons, reading, praying, and the like (being found workers of ini∣quity) will do them no good, but this dreadfull sentence from the Lord will be pronounced against them, Go cursed workers of iniquity, I know you not, depart from me, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Consider of this all you carnall and formall Professors, Priests and People, who talke so much of the name of God, drawing neer unto him with your lips and with your mouths, but your hearts goes after your covetousnesse and things of this world, which comes to an end and withers and fades away, and pleads against the power and purity of Godlyness; saying, none can ever be made free from
sin nor perfect in this world, but must continue in sin or sin in him while he lives, and so have made a Covenant with hell and with death, and no longer time will serve the devill your master whole servants you are, as long as you live in sin) but terme of life; What will ye answer the Lord in that day, will then a distincti∣on serve you, that you have not sinned unto death, or that your sin shall not be imputed to you? Shall not then the witnesse of God in your own conscience, which all along hath testified a∣gainst you, for your ungodly practises and reproved you for your secret evils? Shall it not stop your mouths and you shall stand speechlesse, and shall be made to confesse that God is just, and your condemnation just, who in your life time have rejected his counsell, and cast his Law behind your backs, and have turned his grace into lasciviousness, know this assuredly, this will be your portion at the latter day, for God is just and will ren∣der a just reward unto every one, according to their deeds done in the body whether they be good or whether they be evill; They that have improved their talents and done well, shall enter into the Lords joy: But those who have sleighted the Lords free love, which is freely tendred and have been carelesse and negligent and have not improved, their tallents shall be cast out from his pre∣sence, and shall have their portion in the lake of utter darknesse, where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth: and this shall be the condemnation of all the world who hate the light, that Jesus Christ hath enlightened them withall, and love their evill deeds better then the light: For this is the condemnati∣on of the world, (not because light is not come,) but that light is come into the world, and men love darknesse rather then light, because their deeds are evil, and so all the world lies under con∣demnation who are in the sin and evill and deny the light, which gives the entrance into the Kingdoms of Christ, which stands in righteousness, and no unrighteous one can enter, for no en∣trance is made but through the death of sin, and there is no death nor freedom from sin, but only by the Son of God, there is no way but by him, no salvation but in him, no separation from sin nor reconciliation to God, but only by the Son o God, who is given of the Father a Covenant of light into the World, who doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, and by this light is the Devils work seen, and by faith in him who
hath given the light is the heart purified and the conscience pur∣ged from dead works, and so the devils works comes to be de∣stroyed, for, for this purpose was the Son of God made manifest that he might destroy the works of the devill; and the works of the devil are in the heart; for in the time of the night the devil the enemy of man, he hath wrought his works in the heart of man, and so hath wrought and begotten him into his image, to do his work, and so man becomes a servant to the devil, brin∣ging forth fruits of unrighteousnesse, and this is all done in the heart, the devil having gotten possession, and sits and rules as King in the heart of man; and there is the ground of all sin, it a riseth out of the heart, which is deceitful and desperately wicked from thence ariseth pride, envy, wrath, malice, murders, drunken∣nesse, lying, swearing, adultery, fornication, covetousness, per∣secution, tiranny and oppression, and all other evills whatsoe∣ver they have their ground and rise from with in out of the heart, for there is no man tempted of God, but every man when he is tempted he is drawn a way of his own lust, for lust is conceived in the heart, and after it is conceived it brings forth sin, and sin being finished brings forth death, and the wayes of sin is death: and while sin lodgeth and is regarded in the heart, it de∣files the heart and separates from God, and all the prayers and sacrifices that are offered up unto God from an impure heart, are abomination to him; all outward shewes and outward clean∣sing, will not avail nor bring peace, as long as the ground and root of sin remains within, for it is the heart which the Lord re∣quires, as it is written my Son give me thy heart; so it is an inward work that every one must know and witnesse, if ever you know true peace, and rest, for as the devils work is within in the heart and defiles the heart, so must the work of Christ be within likewise, for the destroying of the devils works, and for the purifying of the heart, for this is the mistery which hath been hid, and is hid from all wisedom of the flesh, and from all vul∣trous eyes and venomous beasts, and reveiled to the Babes and Lambs of God, who have laid down their Crowns at the feet of the Lamb, and have denied themselves and the pomp and glory of this world, and do bear the dayly Cross and despised the shame, and do love and walk in the light, which the world hates, and thereby are led out of darknesse, and the ungodly
practises which the world lives in: into righteousness and peace to exercise a good conscience towards God and towards man; and this must every one own, if ever they own the living God, or a pure conscience where the Mistery of faith is held, they must own this light to guide them in the exercise of their con∣sciences: for this light is the eye, whereby a man comes to see himself and the root and ground of sin, and untill man comes to own this light he never comes truly so see himself, and so is far from denying self, for first a man must see himself before he can deny himself, and the light it is, that let a man see his sin, and that he is driven from God, and out of union with God, be∣cause of his sin: and it is sin that separate from God, and breaks the peace with God, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; all have gone astray (we our selves even as o∣thers) and have been wandring as Sheep without a Shepherd, but the Lord of Hosts is risen; and hath sent forth his Son even Jesus Christ the true Shepherd, who is gathering his Sheep into the fold where they shall lye down in peace, and none shall make them afraid; and if the Son make you free, then are you free indeed, but no freedom there is but only by him, whose bloud washeth and cleanseth from all sin; and whereas it is sai, If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us; This was spoken to a condition before confession, as is plain to the Children of Light, for saith he, if we confesse our sins he is faithfull and just to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness: he doth not say from part but from all, and this they witnessed who were in the light, and hath fellowship with the Father and the Son, as is written, God is light, and in him is no darkness at all, he that saith he hath fellowship with God and walks in darkness, is a liar, and doth not the truth; But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the bloud of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin; and him wee witnesse, even Jesus Christ the everlasting Covenant of God, who makes free to the utmost all that come unto God by him; and wee testify against all those that oppose the pure do∣ctrine of Christ Jesus, and sayes, none can be fully cleansed from sin while they live upon the earth, and so would make the bloud of Christ of none effect, which (whosoever walketh
and abideth in the light of Christ, his bloud) cleanseth from all sin, for whosoever abides in him, sins not, he that sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him, and this the Scripture decla∣reth, and I bear testimony and set to my seal that it is true, for he that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous, and hee that commits sin is of the devill, for the devil sinneth from the beginning: but whosoever is born of God doth not com∣mit sin, for his seed remaines in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God, and in this are the Children of God made ma∣nifest, and the children of the dvil, 1 Joh. 3. &c. He that is born of God is the Son of God, and the Son of God doth not commit sin; and except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, for the first man is of the earth earthly, and minds earthly things, his joy and treasure is there, in things that are below, delighting in the visible things, his heart is there, his care and labour is for the things of this life, what to eat, what to drink, what to put on, how to become great in the earth, and by his earthly wisedom which is from below, (which is sensual and devilish) he is plotting & contriving to get great possessions, and to compaste the earth to get himself a name in the earth, but cannot be satisfied, when he hath com∣passed one piece of ground which he coveted after, presently the lust runs out again and covets more, but is never satisfied, and in this state man is an enemy to God, and the thoughts of his heart are evill, and that continually, and notwithstanding many times a true sense and feeling of his sad and miserable con∣dition is arising in him, and the witnesse of God reproving him and calling him from his abominations and whoredoms, and many times brings him into some trouble, yet he sleights his love and hates the reproof and goes on in his rebellious wayes, and so treasures up to himself wrath, against the day of wrath and revellation of the righteous judgement of God, who will render a just reward unto him according to his deeds, and here lies all the ungodly world, driven from God, out of his Cove∣nant, out of his peace, out of his presence, out of his pure love and spiritual worship, and are loving and delighting in and wor∣shiping the creature more then the Creator: But the Saints and holy men of God, who came to witnesse redemption and were in Covenant with God, and faith of his Son, had passed from death
to life, and they had put of the body of sin, and the old man and his deeds, and were created anew, being born again of the eter∣nall word, which liveth and abideth for ever; and their hearts was purified, and their consciences purged from dead works, and ther bodies made fit Temples holy and pure for the Lord God to dwell in, and there was his worship, in the spirit, in his holy Temple, where there is no need of Sun Moon or of Candle, but the glory of the Lord fils the Temple, and this they witnessed who were redeemed from the earth, and were in Christ Jesus, where there union, joy, and fellowship was, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumsition, nor uncircumsition Barbarian, Scy∣thian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all; and the same is the Lord our God, now working and bringing to passe even by his own power and outstretched arm is he getting himself the victory, what we are, we are of and by him, he alone it is that worketh in us both to will and to do, by his own power made manifest in us, and worketh mightily in us, whereby wee are made willing to do his will and work, and this is all by his Son, who of God is made wisdom, justification, sanctification and re∣demption, he is made unto us all things, and through him we can do all things even through the Son of God, whom we know is come, and hath given us an understanding to know him that is true, and wee are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ, who is our life, our joy, our stay and strength, by whom we are freed from sin, and from our vain conversations, which formerly we lived in; who hath broken the bond of iniquity, and set the oppressed free, to praise and glorify his name, who alone do praise him, the dead cannot praise him, it is the living, the living that praises him to whom be everlasting praises and glory, world without end, Amen. So I say and declare that if any man say he hath no sin before he come to confesse his sin, and to witnesse the power of God cleansing him from his sin, he doth decive himself, and the wit∣nesse of God in his own conscience will testify against him and be his condemnation: But where the living power of God is made manifest to purify and cleanse, and to destroy the works of the devil, to burn up and consume the old heavens and the old earth, which is cursed and brings forth cursed fruits: I say where the old is destroyed, and the new heaven and the new earth witnessed,
wherein dwells righteousness. Shall we deny the work of God? Not far be it from us, but to declare his marvailous works which he hath wrought in our dayes, to ages and generations to come that they may dread and fear the name of our God, and to others who sit in darknesse and in the shadow of death, who are wan∣dring astray as sheep without a Shepherd, and are feeding upon the husk, and spending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which doth not satisfy: freely from the bowels of tender love to their soules, do we declare what the Lord hath done for our soules, that they might return home into the Fathers house, where there is bread enough to satisfy the hun∣gry thirsting soul, that every one may eat their own bread, and sit under their own vine, and have union and feilowship with us in our fathers love for evermore. So in the name of the Lord I do warn all people who read these lines, to repent and cease from all their sins and abominations, which formerly they have lived in, and from all the false and Idolatrous worships of the world, which a long time ye have followed, and thereby have been deceived and led captive laden with sin, but have not come to the true knowledg of God, but are still in their old crooked and perverse nature, and knows not the Crosse of Christ, nor the yoke nor the bridle to the tongue, but are at ease in the flesh, and can speake their own words, and think their own thoughts, and do their own works; I say return, return, and hearken diligently to the voyce of the Son of God, which cryes for purity and ho∣linesse, without which none can see God, that thereby your soules may live, and may feed upon the dayly bread in the Fathers bo∣some, which whosoever eats of this bread shal never hunger, and he that drinks of this cup shall never thirst; but it shall be a well of living water, springing up unto eternal life: so every one wayt in the measure of light, which from Christ you have received for the appearance of Christ in you, that his life may be made mani∣fest in your mortal bodies: for this is the command of God, This is my beloved Son hear him; and Christ, the Son calls, and says, Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, I am meek and lowly in spirit, and you shall find rest to your soules. So all people come freely, his love is freely tendred to you, sleight not the tender profers of his love, but come forth and separate your selves, and touch no
unclean thing and the Lord will receive you, and will be a Fa∣ther unto you, and you shall be his Sons and Daughters, mind the pure and still voyce, that thereby you may be led into the pure life, and pure union and love of the children of light; for if you neglect such great salvation, woe will be your portion for ever. There ore whie you have the light believe in the light, and work while it is day, before the dreadfull night of darkness come when none can work. By one who hath seen the deadness and emptiness of all the formal worships and formal profession that stands in the will of man act d in mans will, who is returned back into his fathers house, and there dwels in rest and peace, and hath ceased from his own work; written forth in the bowels of love to captive and weary souls, who have long been tossed to and fro, by following the changeable doctrine of men, but are not satisfied that they may return home into the fathers house with me, where they shall find satisfaction and plenteous redemption, where all the Saints are one, and their food one, and have a new name written, which none knows nor can read but those that hath it: and there my name is written in the Spiritual book of life, and they that are there do it read and know.

An answer to some of the false doctrines, held forth by one Vavasar Powel, who is called a Master and a Minister, and something further occasioned by some conference held with the said Vavasar, in the publick meeting place at old Rad∣nor in Wales; shewing the unsoundness of his sormation: and to be one in nature and rage with all the Parish Teachers, which hee hath so much tryed against written for the sake of the simple ones, that they may be awarned and fore-armed to keep out of his snare. GReat hath been and is the rage of the world & the pro∣fessors of truth, against the life and power of truth where-ever it was made manifest in former generati∣ons, as it is now in this generation against the despised people of God, whom the Lord hath owned, and made his pow∣er manifest, whom the scorners that knows not God do call Qua∣kers, especially the Priests, and they who professe themselves Teachers of the Nations, who in their high places utters forth their spight and venome, and incensing their hearts against them, as though they were a people not worthy to live: Amongst whom one who is called Mr. Vavasar Powel, who is called a Teacher, and much set up and adored by the blind Professors in Wales and other parts, who is looked upon to be one above the rest and separated from them, yet in persecution & rage joyn with them, and exceeds many of them in railing, backbiting, and casiling many false aspersions upon the innocent people and harmlesse Lambs of Christ, in his high place uttering forth such
things as are not fit to be mentioned by any that professes the name of God, much lesse by one who professes himself a Mini∣ster of God. And I being in those parts of Wales, and hearing of his railing accusations against the people of God, in most places where he came, and I amongst the rest of my bethren was falsly accused and slandered by some of his hearers, and I being innocent, and the Lords truth cleer from all those things falsly charged upon us was moved of the Lord to go to old Radnor in VVales on the 5. day of the 3. month called May 1656. to stand a witness for the living truth of God against Powel and all oppo∣sers of the truth, and that day he the said Powel was found in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, whom our Lord Jesus Christ cried woe against, he went up into the high place, and stood praying in the Sinagogue as the Scribes and Pharisees did, he is called of men Master, contrary to the command of Christ to his Ministers, who saith unto his, be not ye called of men Master, for ye have but one Master even Christ, and ye are brethren; but Vavasar Powell is called of men Master, contrary to the com∣mand of Christ, which none of his true Ministers were; and so under the woe. The true Ministers of God had the Spirit of God, and had salt in themselves to savour withall, and they knew who were the true Ministers of God, and who were deceivers even by the Spirit of God that was in them, and they prayed by the Spirit of God. But Vavasar Powel in this is short of the true Ministers; for he in his prayer desired that the Lord would disco∣ver and shew them, who his true Ministers were, and who were deceivers, and in this thing he is made manifest, and doth plainly appear that he prayed not by the Spirit of God, who cannot discern the true Ministers from the deceivers, and so hath not salt in himself to savour withall, but hath lost his honour and is good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of man, for the Spirit of the Lord doth discern and discover, and put a difference between the precious and the vile, and betwixt the true Ministers and the deceivers; in this he is found contrary to the true Ministers of God. He said and held forth, that every naturall man had a fourfold light, but denyed that he had any light in him that was pure, to lead him to Christ. He said that all men were wholy in darknesse, and nothing at all of the spiritual light in them, (or words to that effect) and yet said that
every naturall man had a talent which if he did not improve was his condemnation. Now all whose eyes are in any measure opened may see his confusion, for if the natural man have a ta∣lent, and the talent be natural, then a natural man that improves his natural talent, may enter into the Lords joy: as is plain in Scripture, for he that had five talents gained other five, and he that had two he gained other two; and the Lord calling them to account pronounces to them well done good and faithful servants enter into your Masters joy; but the slothful servant who did not improve his talent was cast out, but the talent was taken from him, and given to him that had improved: And in this thing I stand a withesse against Mr. Powell so called, and do witnesse to Jesus the True Light, the same which Iohn bare testimony of, who lighteth every one that cometh into the world who is pure and spiritual, in whom is life, and the life is the light of men, and his life is spiritual, and so is his light, which the dark world can∣not comprehend, for this is the condemnation of the world who love their evill deeds and hate the light: for every one that doth truth, he loveth the light, and brings his deeds to the light, and thereby is led out of darknesse by oaths and crooked wayes, and so shall have the light of life: But he that doth evil he hateth the light, and will not bring his deeds to the light, because he knows the light will reprove him, and so the light is his condemnation, and is the same and one with that, which is the salvation of the believer: so I say that the light is one in the believer, as in the unbeliever, according to measure as the talents were one, given to the slothfull as well as the faithfull, and the talents were pure, and those who improved them entred into joy, and he that did not was cast out into utter darknesse, but the talent was not, for it was taken from him, and given to him that had, &c. So this is the condemnation of the world and all the ungodly ones who live in ungodlinesse, they are condemned by the light, for the light is pure, and that which reproves and makes manifest sin, is light, as the Apostle declares, Eph. 5.13. and this light shews sin before the action of it, it shews it in its rise and conception, before it come to action, if there be but an evil thought, or an evill motion, or an evil desire, or any evill intent the light disco∣vers it, and waiting in the light and believing in Christ, who hath given the light, the victory is obtained, for the true faith purifies
the heart, and gives victory over the world, and without faith it is not possible to please God, and Paul who was a true Mini∣ster of God he was sent to open the blind eyes, (not to bring them eyes) but to open that eye which the God of the world had blinded, and so to turn them from darknesse unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God that they might receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance a mongst them that are sanctified by faith in Jesus Christ, and he preached Jesus Christ which was within the Saints their hope of glory, teaching and exhorting every man in all wisedom, that they might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, Col. 1.27, 28. And when Christ ascen∣ded he gave some Apostles and some Prophets, and some Evan∣gelists, and some Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ, Eph. 4.11, 12. this is the pure doctrine of Christ Jesus, and that which he him∣self taught, Mat. 5.48. Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect. But this doctrine Powell, and all the Pa∣rish Teachers do oppose, and so manifest themselves to bee Anti-Christ a gainst Christ and his true Ministers, and serve ano∣ther Master which is the Devil whose work they are doing, plea∣ding strongly for his Kingdom, which stands in sin and imper∣fection, and sayes none can be perfect while they live upon the earth, this with them is an impossible thing, but with God all things are possible, and the true Ministers of God believe it and do earnestly contend for this faith, and for their Master Christ and his Kingdom, which stands in righteousnesse, purity and perfection, and no unrighteous one, nor imperfect one can enter into it, then woe to them that live in sin while they are upon earth, their end will be in the lake of endlesse misery, and this shall Powell and all the Antixtian Bablers one day wit∣nesse: And Powell in words this did preach, that no unrighte∣ous one could enter into the Kingdom of God, and as long as any one sin was alive in any, though never so little the devil could keep them by one, as well as by many bringing this com∣parison, that if a fisher-man had catched hold of a fish, and the fish had broken two of his haires, yet by one he might catch
him; so saith he all sin must be destroyed, and the house clean swept, and afterward he pleaded for sin and said, none could be without sin, nor perfect while he lived (see his confusion) by this doctrine a man must never be without the devill in him, for all sin is of the devill, and while sin is within; the devill is with in. But the true Ministers of God who came to witnesse Christ Iesus and his life and power, made manifest in them, did witnesse the devills work destroyed, and consumed by his word, which was as a fire in them, and the Ministers of Christ do witnesse the same now, by the same living power by which the devils works comes to be destroyed, and the Son of God witnessed who makes free from sin, and if the Son make you free, then are you free indeed; and in this Mr. Powell, so called, is out of the doctrine of Christ, and contrary to his true Ministers. Further the said Powell in the presence of many people, did affirm that the Scriptures were the foundation and ground of Faith; which thing I did deny, and did testify a gainst him for blasphemy, and do still affirm the same, that whosoever doth say and teach that the Scripture is the foundation of Faith, is a liar and a blasphe∣mer, and doth lay another foundation contrary to the Apostles, as is testifyed of in 1 Cor. 3.11. For no other foundation can any man lay, then that is laid, which is Iesus Christ, and the same do I witnesse and no other: and here Powell must either confesse the Scriptures to be Christ, or else he layeth another foundation, contrary to that which all the holy men of God were built upon, which had faith before the Scriptures were written. Abel had faith before the Scripture was written, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and many others mentioned and spoken of in the Scripture, they had faith and were built upon the rock, even Iesus Christ, who was before Abraham was, and before the letter or writing was, who was before the world was, who is the same yesterday to day and for ever, who is the ground and foundation of faith: And Powell, and all the Parish Teach∣ers in England and else where, that says the Scriptures are the foundation, are in the blasphemy and error, and his and their fouudation will not stand in the day of the Lord, which shall burn up their works as hay and stuble, and this shall Powell one day witnesse to be truth to him, and all others who lay another foundation, which is but sandy, and cannot stand, but great
shall be the fall of it, when the storm and tempest doth arise; and in this the said called Mr. Powel is contrary to the true Mini∣sters of Christ, and the Scriptures shall be a testimony against him and his blasphemy, who sets the Scriptures in the place of Christ, which onely testify of Christ, but are not Christ; and the Scriptures declare of the foundation of faith Iesus Christ, but the Scriptures are not the foundation Christ Jesus, neither did any of the Ministers of Christ ever call the Scriptures the founda∣tion and ground of faith; but witnessed and declared Christ to be the Author and the finisher of their faith, and the rock and foundation which they were built upon, and the same do I testi∣fy of, even Jesus Christ, who was from the beginning, and the same to day and for ever, who was the rock in former ages, and the ground of their faith, and the rock of this age, and so the rock of ages, and the ground and foundation, and the Author, and finisher of our faith, to whom be all honour and glory of and from all that know him for evermore. And further as I was speaking of the word of the Lord, and its power and effect, and that the Holy men of God who came to witnesse the word of the Lord, then knew it not by hearsay from others, but by its powerfull operation in them, by which word their hearts was purifyed and cleansed, which word was within them as a fire to burn up and consume the works of the devill, and as a hammar to break the hard heart, and this word was not far of, as the Apostle testifieth, say not in thy heart who shall ascend up into Heaven to fetch Christ from above, or go down into the deep to fetch him from below, but the word is nigh thee in thy heart and in thy mouth, and this is the word of faith that we preach, Rom. 10.8. and this word was within them, and wrought powerfully in them, which they witnessed to be quick and powerfull sharper then a two edged sword; and those who know not this living and powerfull word within them puts the letter for the word and calls that the word; and when I spoke these words, the said Powell said unto me, Is not the Scriptures called the word of God? And then I said unto him, is it the word of God (for it hath long been called so by ignorants, that knows not God and his word) and he affirmed, and said it was, and was put to prove it, and he brought two places of Scriptures,
but neither place did say that the Scriptures was the word of God, but declared of the word: and then Powell said to his hearers, we will leave them heare, they deny the Scriptures to be the word of God; and some of his hearers were very ready to receive it, and cryed out they deny the Scripture; whereupon I spoke to them and wished to be moderate and hear with patience, and do not accuse falsly. That because we cannot call the Scriptures by the name of Christ, do we therefore deny the Scripture? No, far be it from us, to deny it, for if I should deny its testimony, I should deny my own life; and I said, I own it to be a true declaration of that word that was in them that spoke it forth, and it was the word of the Lord to them and in them that spoke it forth; but for ungodly and un∣holy men to talk of their words, and not live in their life, are theeves that steales the word from their neighbour; and some of the people said, was it the word of the Lord to them and not to us? And this they would not hear; and then I instanced some Scriptures to them, how that the word of the Lord came to the true Prophets, and they spoke the word of the Lord as they had received it from the mouth of the Lord; and after it was spoken forth, the false Prophets stole the true Prophets words, and they said, thus saith the Lord, when the Lord never spoke to them, and so run when the Lord never sent them, and therefore they did not profit the people at all. And this further I say, that as it was then even so it is now in these our dayes prond men, and cove∣tous men, heady and high minded men, and men that followes pleasures and are lovers thereof, more then lovers of God, and envyous men, and men of strife and railers, back-biters, slande∣rers and false accusers, and such like ungodly and unholy men, have gotten the Scriptures, the good words which the holy men of God spoke forth from the holy and pure word of God, which was within them, which was (and is) spiritual and invisible, and endures for ever, such ungodly men aforementioned, have gotten the declaration, and are talking of the fame of God, but are stran∣gers to the living life and power of God, and they fay this saith the Lord, or hearken to the word of the Lord as you shall find it written in such a chapter and such a verse; and so use their tongues and say, the Lord saith (as the false Prophets did) when the Lord never spake to them, and so have gotten a form of godli∣ness,
but want the life and power, and leads silly (men and) women captive, laden with sin and led away with divers lusts ever learning, but never able to come to the true knowledge of God: so I say that many may have the Scriptures (which were given forth from them who knew the voyce and word of God) and know not neither have heard the voyce of God nor his word, but onely the sound or frame of it: for the Iews who had the Scriptures, Moses writings, and the Prophets, and could speake much of them, and often heard them read, and yet Christ tells them plainly, they had neither heard his voyce at any time, nor seen his shape, for they had not the word of God abiding in them for whom the Father had sent they did not believe, and there Christ himself calls them Scriptures which testify of him, but he doth not call them the Word of God; for if they had been the Word of God, then the Iews had heard the word of God, but Christ tells them they had not at any time heard the voyce of God, neither was the word of God abiding in them: as it is written, Ioh. 5.37, 38, 39. &c. And now a few words concerning the word of God, from Scripture testimony which the Holy men of God spoke forth, and so witnesses to the same eternall word, which I bear testimony of, which was in the beginning before all time, by which the Heavens and the earth were made, and are upheld by the word of his power, as it is written, Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3. Psal. 33.6. Heb. 1.3. And the word of the Lord is spiritual and endures for ever, it is as a fire and as a hammer that breaks the rocks in pie∣ces. The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper then any two edged sword, and pearces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, 1 Pet. 1.23.25. Ier. 23.29. Hebr. 4.12. But the Scriptures or writings were nor in the beginning before all time: but were since the beginning in time, neither were the Heavens made by the Scriptures, not are all things upheld by the Scripture, neither do they endure for ever; but they are visible and in times passed away, but the word of the Lord which the Scriptures declare of, is spirituall, and shall endure for ever: The Scriptures or writings are not as a fire, but with fire may be burnt, as Ieremiah his roll was burnt, but the
word of the Lord cannot be burnt, for by the living word ano∣ther Roll was written: The Scriptures or writings are not as a hammar, but with a hammar may be beaten to pieces, neither is the Scriptures quick, nor sharper then a two edged sword; but they are dead, and with a two edged sword may be cut to pie∣ces, behold your ignorance you carnall Professors, whose un∣derstandings are so dark, and your eyes so blind that you stum∣ble at noon day, and so cannot put a difference between the precious and the vile, nor between the living word and the dead letter, but sets the letter in the place of Christ, as Vavasar Powel doth, who calls the Scriptures the Foundation of Faith, and the Word of God: when plain Scripture doth testify against him, and witnesseth Christ to be the Foundation and the Au∣thour and finisher of Faith, whose name is called the Word, of God, Heb. 12.2. Rev. 19, 13. Many other Scriptures I might bring that witnesses of the Word of God, for all the whole Scriptures being given forth from the word, declare of the word, and so they are called by the Ministers of the word, Luke the first. But it hath been a common thing amongst the Professours of our time, because wee do not, nay dare not set the Scriptures in the place of Christ, nor call them by his name, to accuse us for denying of the Scriptures, but their accusation wee do de∣ny, and let our lives and conversations which wee live in Christ Jesus, be witnesses for the Lord and for us herein, and I appeal to the conscience of all the honest hearted in the na∣tion to judge, whether those who talk so much of Scripture, and calls it the Word of God and their Rule to walk by: and they themselves live in pride and covetousnesse, strife and envy, wrath, malice, stubbornesse and crosnesse, backbiting and speaking evill one of another behind their backs, foolish jest∣ing, idle communication, vain sports and pleasures, and in the customes and fashions of the world, little or nor at all dif∣fering from them in any thing but in words, which things the Scripture testifies against or those who live in the fear of God in meeknesse and humility, and cannot fashion themselves ac∣cording to the world, nor use the vain customes and traditions of men, who cannot bow to the rich, nor respect the persons
of those who were the gay cloathing and the gold Ring, no more then the poor man in the vile Rayment, which of these doth deny the Scriptures, those who talke of them, and live not in the life of them: or those whose lives and conversations are according to them, let the wise in heart Judge. A. P.
An answer to some Queries given to my hands, which were propoun∣ded by one who goes under the name of an Anabaptist, living in Shrewsbury. SOme Queries I have received from one who subscribes his name Richard Stephens, wherein he saith the intent of his writing is to be better informed in things wherein he is not satisfied. But in the Light of Jesus he is comprehended, and seen to be of that Generation, who cryed up the Commands and the Ordinances of God, as Temple, Sabbath, Circumci∣sion, Priests, Sacrifices, Scriptures and the like, and said they were of Abraham, and God was their Father, and they builded the Tombs of the Prophets, and garnished the sepulchre of the righteous, and condemned their fore-fathers, saving, if we had lived in their dayes, we would not have killed the Prophets, and yet these crucified the Son of God, and they did not believe in him, who was the light, the Covenant of the Fa∣ther, the sum and substance of those things which they upheld, which were but figures, tipes and shadows, yet in their time Commands of God, and were to bee observed and kept, yet those who had these outward Commands, did not believe in the Light, but were by (Christ) the Light cryed woe against, and those who believed in the Light and followed Christ, denyed those outward Commands, and had no Scripture for it, but the testimony of the light within them; which was a hard thing in those times to deny the Commands in the letters; for the Jews and Chief Priests had Scripture to uphold them; and counted the Apostles deceivers, and a cursed people that knew not the
Law: But by the mighty power of God they were carried on and witnessed against the outward Commands, and cryed against them that upheld them: and witnessed the Commands of God, and the worship of God in the spirit; and their bodies wa Tem∣ples of the Holy Ghost, and God dwelt in them; so the new Covenant they witnessed the Law of God written in their hearts, and the spirit put in the inward parts, which was their guide in the spiritual worship, and these denyed those things which once were Commands of God, which were outward and typical, and it was no breach of the Commands of God to them, but obedi∣ence to the commands of the Spirit of God in them, by which they witnessed against the shadows, and witnessed the sub∣stance: And a generation there is now (of which this man that gave forth these Queries is one) who hath gotten the good words (the Scriptures) and painted themselves over with a covering, like the spirit, but is not the spirit; and these cry up the Church of Christ, and the ordinances of Christ, and condemnes the Jewes their fore-fathers for crucifying of Christ, and yet they are found in the same nature, who deny the light and counts them deceivers and a cursed generation who are in the light, who (with the light) deny their imitated Churches, and taken on commands, which it no more but a will worship, and a self righteousnesse which stands in the will of man, which is as fil∣thy rags and as menstruous cloathes; seen they are and compre∣hended in the light of Christ to be under the woe out of the Cove∣nant of our God; and here is the ground of all the sects and opi∣nions and the many Religions: Man living in his will, and pro∣fessing the Scriptures which came not by the will of man, but con∣trary to mans will, here man in his will is giving his prvate meanings and interpretations, and one he gives one meaning to the Scriptures, and sets up a Religion and a worship of God, ac∣cording to his meaning, and conceiving from the letter of the Scripture in his will; Another he gives another meaning, and sets up another worship and a Religion, according to his mea∣ning and conceiving from the Scriptures: and so a third gives his meaning, and so are divided into many sects and opinions; and these are the Babel builders, one building up a wall, and ano∣ther daubing with untempered morter, and these are out of the faith and union of the Saints who walk in the light, and have
union and fellowship in the spirit of love, written in one ano∣thers heart, and so are all of one heart: But the other who stands in their wills, and imitates and takes on commands in their own wills, as their imaginations thoughts and conceivings leads them, are not all of one heart, but are divided, and some sprinkle water on the face of a child, and calls that Baptizme; and others deny that, and are dipped over head and ears in wa∣ter, and calls that Baptizme, and then they call themselves Beleevers and Saints, and so run to the letter of the Scripture, and reading with a wrong eye, are still in confusion, and more and more divisions there is a mongst them, some are called free∣willers, or that hold generall redemption (that Christ died for all) and some are called particulars, that hold that some are ordained to salvation, and some to condemnation before they have done good or evill, and these deny one another and hold one another accursed, yet all are dipped in the water: some are divided about that which they call the Lords supper, and about breaking of the bread, some will break it themselves, and some will eat it as a supper; some will sup before they eat it, some will have it in an upper chamber, some are for laying on of hands, and some will not: and many other things there are which breakes their union, and thus they are divided in Ba∣bylons Kingdom, tearing and rending one another like dogs and swine, falling out about the husks. But the Saints who are led by the light of the Son of God (out of Babylon) into the fold, do feed upon the bread of life in the Fathers house, where there is no want, but fulnesse where the presence of the Lord is en∣joyed, and the holy and innocent ones who are washed and cleansed in the bloud of the Lamb, rejoyce in his presence who are Baptized into Christ and have put on Christ, whose hearts are purified and conscience purged from dead works, these are Christians: But to sprinkle water on the face of a child doth not make it a Christian, or to be dipped over head and eares in water doth not wash and cleanse from sin; for hee is not a Christian which is one outward which hath the name only, nei∣ther is that the Baptizme which is outward with the water: But he is a Christian which is in Christ a new Creature, and Bap∣tizme is that of the spirit, having the heart sprinkled from an evill conscience, and the body washed with pure water, and
this Baptizme I own and witnesse unto, and deny all imitatour who have not a command from God, as they had that gave forth the Scriptures. Yet this I say, if any one now have a com∣mand from Christ to go and Baptize with water: or if any out of tendernesse of Conscience do such a thing, I do not deny it, nor judge them for it: But I was not sent to Baptize but to preach the Gospel, and it is no breach of Christs command, nor denying his ordinances in not Baptizing, not being commissioned by him to Baptize, for it is neither dipping nor sprinkling, or not dip∣ping that availes any thing but a new Creature, so to deny that which was a command of Christ to some, being but outward, it not being a command by Christ unto us, is no breach of Christs command, no more then it was in the Apostles in denying the outward commands, as Temple, Sabbath, Circumsition, and the like, which were commands in their time and place, and wee own them, and all the commands of God mentioned in the Scriptures by the same spirit which gave them forth: which spirit was the Saints Rule before the Scriptures were written, and their Rule who gave forth the Scripture, and the Saints Rule now ac∣cording to the Scripture, owning all things in their time and place as the Scripture declares of, and though we be counted as deceivers, yet true, it is no more but what the Ministers of Christ undergone from that generation, who were high in knowledge as doctours, chief Priests and learned Rabbies, yet by all their learning and Scripture knowledge they knew not the mistery, but counted the Crosse of Christ foolishnesse; as it is now by this ge∣neration of Scripture learned ones and university men, by all their learning and study the mistery of Godlinesse they know not, but counts them an ignorant people to whom the Lord hath made known himself in measure, and reveiled his secrets unto, and counts them as a people not worthy to live; I say amongst that generation that cryes up the commands of Christ in words I find this man querying without. But for the simple ones sake who de∣sire to be satisfied, I have written this in answer to his queries, that their minds may be informed, and from the darknesse they may be turned to the true light of lesus, which opens the dark un∣derstanding and leads out of darknesse to follow Christ in the pure path of life, which whosoever follows shall not abide in darknesse, but shall have the light of life.
Query the I. Whether you do own the New Testament with the Epistles of the Apostles unto the Churches, to be a true te∣stimony of the spirit of the Lord, yea or nay: And if they be whe∣ther were they not given forth as a Rule unto the Churches to walk by, and if they were not given forth as a Rule, then where∣fore were they given forth, and what use were they of unto the Churches? Answ. The New Testament we do own and witnesse, which is the Law of God written in our hearts, and the spirit put in the inward parts, whereby we are gathered together into the fold, and are fed with living refreshments in the bosome of our Fathers love, which spirit was and is a Rule and guide unto the Saints, and thereby are taught of God in spirit, and do worship him in spirit, according to his promise, which promise is now fulfilled and fulfilling to his praise and glory, to whom all glory belongs for evermore: And the Epistles of the Apostles to the Churches we own to be a true testimony given forth from the spirit of the Lord, and was the word of the Lord in them and to them, to whom they were written for the edifying and building them up in their most holy faith, which faith was within them, a mistery held in a pure conscience; and their Rule and guid was within them, and all that was written or declared by the holy men of God, it was to bring them to the pure worship of God within, in the spirit. Qu. II. Whether the Scriptures be of any use unto any people now in this generation; and if they are then whether the Ordinances therein conteyned, be to be practised by such a peo∣ple as beleeve in the Lord Iesus with all their hearts, yea or nay? And if they are not to be practised then when and where were they abolished. Ans. The Scriptures are not of any private interpretation, neither (came by) mans will, but holy men of God spoke them forth as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and they are of use, for they were given forth to be read to be believed on to bee practised and fulfilled, but not to make a trade on, nor for un∣godly men with their vain and proud minds to talk on, but let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity, and as iniquity is departed from, and the fear of God placed in the heart, it keepes the heart cleare, and so the pure wisdom
from above, is received into the pure heart, and the pure in heart are blessed and shall see God who is light, and the Ordinances of God are seen in the light and led into by the light, but the darknesse cannot comprehend the light, nor all the wisedom of the world, and such puts darknesse for light, and light for dark∣nesse, and calls the ordinances and traditions of men the ordi∣nances of Christ, and so would make the word of God of none effect by their traditions; for they are the Sons of God who are led and guided by the Spirit of God, and such denyes the shadows who witnesse the substance, for if ye be dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances: God is a Spirit, and his ordinances are spiritual in the Gospel Administration. Qu. III. Whether or no they are not blessed that do observe to do all the Ordinances and the Commands of the Lord Christ therein conteyned, yea or nay, and if they are then whether are not they a cursed generation of men, that do not observe to do them, but to teach men to break them. Answ. They are blessed that do observe all the Command∣ments of the Lord Christ, that they may have right unto the tree of life, and may enter in through the gate into the City: But to that in thy conscience do I speak, art thou one that dost observe al the Commandments of the Lord Christ, art thou brought to yea and nay in thy communication, art thou brought to do to all men as thou would have them to do unto thee? Doth not some∣thing in thy conscience testify against thee, and let thee see the contrary? If any one sue thee at the Law and take away the Coat, let him have thy Cloak also, dost thou obey this command, or dost thou not rather go quite contrary, instead of letting him have thy Cloak with thy Coat, would not thou go to Law with him before hee should have thy Coat? To that in thy conscience do I speak; if one smite thee on one cheek, dost thou turn the other, or would not something in thee arise to smite again? Search and examine, and if upon search thou be found a trans∣gressour, then art not thou one of the cursed generation that dost not observe to do all the commands of the Lord Christ; which those whom thou art smiting & warring against through the ope∣ration of God working in them, are able and brought to observe, & are of the blessed generation, to whom all the promises of God are due.
Qu. IV. Whether there be any other Gospel then that which was declared and testified of unto the world, by Christ and his Disciples, which is left upon record unto us in this our genera∣tion in the Scriptures of Truth, yea or nay? And whether this that you declare be the same that Christ and his Apostles did declare unto the Saints in their generation both for matter and manner? Answ. There is no other Gospel but that which was declared and testified of by Christ and his Disciples; and the same Gospel do we preach and no other, which is a mistery not known to the world, which cannot be contained in a book nor written in letters, for that which is written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and Iohn, is but a declaration, and that may be bought and sold for money: But the Gospel cannot be bought and sold for money, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that beleeves, and those that witnessed the Gospel were freed from sin, and had remission of their sins: But many have the Scriptures, but have not the power of God, but are alive unto sin; and here thou hast much manifested thy folly and weak∣nesse, who would have the Gospel conteined in a book, which all the books in the world cannot conteyn; which Gospel and glad tydings is now witnessed by the Children of Light, free pardon of sin by Jesus Christ, who is come to take away sin; Glory and honour and everlasting praises to his Holy and dread∣full name for ever. Qu. V. Whether the Apostles of Christ which wrote the Epistles unto the Churches, and the Saints in that generation had not as much of the light of Christ within them as any have now in this generation, yea or nay? And wherefore were the E∣pistles written, or did the Apostles write needlesse things, or thy did they not onely call upon them to mind the light which was within them? Ans. Concerning the Apostles and the Saints, having as much of the light of Christ within them, as any have, now it little concernes thee or any one else, I leave it to him from whence all light comes, who is the same now as ever, and changes not, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, and gives to every one light, according as it pleaseth him, which light the Prophets, and Apostles, and Holy men of God, did witnesse in
them; from which they write, and did not write needlesse things, but exhorted to take heed to the light which was within them, which was and is a mistery: we have also a more sure word of Prophesie, unto which ye do well to take heed as unto a light shining in a dark place untill the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts; The word is light, and the word was within them, nigh in their hearts; the Law is light, and the Law was within written in their hearts; the spirit is light, and it was within them to whom the Epistles were written; and the King∣dom of Heaven is light, and it was within though not compre∣hended in the earthly and dark wisedome of man; and Christ Jesus is the light, and this was the mistery which was hid from ages and generations, which was within the Saints, their hope of glory: and thou and all the world that denies the light of Christ within, and stumbles at the light, are strangers to the Co∣venant of promise, and art without God in the world in the sin and disobedience upon whom the wrath of God abides: and thou cannot escape the judgements of God, nor ever come from under the curse untill the light thou dost own to guid and lead thee in the way which is pure, out of the Kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God. Qu. VI. Whether such men who walk up according to the testimony of the Scriptures in the life and power of them, accor∣ding to the measure of light they have received; and yet through the weaknesse of the flesh do commit some sin, though not will∣fully, whether you can pronounce such men children of the de∣vil yea or nay? Ans. Those who walk up according to the Scriptures in the life and power according to the measure of light they have re∣ceived, are kept from the sin abiding in the light, for he that a∣bides in the light sins not; he that sins hath not seen him neither knows him: he that doth righteousnesse is of God, and he that commit sin is of the devil, as the Scripture declareth. Qu. 7. Whether all men and women that have forsaken the rule of the Scriptures, and have betaken themselves to walk by the light within them, are made presently perfect from sin up∣on their owning of the light within; and so cannot sin any more while they live in this flesh. Ans. The Scriptures are not forsaken by those who own
the light, but with the light the words are owned: and all those denyed, who talk of the good words and professe the Scriptures to be their rule, but live not in the pure life, but walk contrary to the Scriptures; and as there is a waiting in the light, there is a growth up from strength to strength, and from glory to glory un∣till the perfect day: But those who live in the flesh cannot prease God, whose faith is not perfect, but is reprobate concerning the faith of Christ, and such cannot believe that ever they shall be made perfect or free from sin while they live upon the earth; and without faith it is impossible to please God. Qu. VIII. VVhether or no the first Resurrection spoken of Revel. 20.6. be in this life yea or nay? And if it be whether hath all that walk by the light within them part in the first re∣surrection so soon as they own that light; and if they have then whether or no is it not possible that they may forsake the light, and walk in darknesse, and so come to cast of the second death, which they that come to partake of the first resurrection shall never cast of; or is not the testimony of that place of Scripture true? Answ. Concerning the first resurrection spoken of Rev. 20.6. it is not in that life that thou lives in, which gave forth these que∣ries: But those who dwelt in the light, and were in the faith had passed from death to life, and in the new life it is known which is in Christ Jesus, who is the resurrection and the life, on such the second death hath no power, and such hath part in the first re∣surrection, and are blessed: But thou hast wronged the Scrip∣ture, and so it shall be a witnesse against thee, which testimony is true witnessed by the same spirit that gave forth the Scripture. Qu. IX. VVhether or no that body of flesh of Christ that suf∣fered at Ierusalem upon the Cross, which Joseph of Arithma∣thea begged of Pilate, and buried in his own sepulchre, rose again the 3. day after it was buried, whether the same body of flesh be now glorified in Heaven with the Father. These few Queries I have written unto you who are called by the name of Quakers, I have not written them to any particu∣lar person of you, but to whomsoever of you shall be free to give me an answer of them in particular in truth, according to your understanding in them, I have not written them in any intent, but onely to be better informed in things wherein I am not in∣formed
in things wherein I am not satisfied from him who wi∣sheth good to all and hurt to none Richard Stephens. Answ. In this query thou art disputing and querying about the body of Jesus, as the devil disputed about the body of Moses: But it is a mistery hid from all dark understandings who hate the light that comes from Jesus, which is the eye that sees him who is invisible, which all who love their evill deeds and hate the light, never shall know nor see, but are shut out and with the light condemned: Thou must first own the light that shewes thee the body of sin, and so pass through the death of the crosse where∣by the body of sin is put of and crucified: then shalt thou know with what body Christ is glorified in Heaven with the Father. Godliness is a great mistery not known to the world nor to the earthly wisedom, but the secrets of God are with them that fear him; the spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep and hidden things of God: So in the fear of God I do exhort thee to return unto God, and mind that principle of God in thee, that reproves thee in secret for thy evill deeds, there is thy Teacher if thou love it, to guide thee to God, but if thou hate it, and live according to the course of this world, it will be thy comdemnation: Prize thy time while thou hast it. VVritten by one who is a lover of all those that love the truth in simplicity and sincerity of heart, who is known to the world by the name of Alexander Par∣ker, but hath a new name which the world knows not; written in the Book of Life.
