THE NEWGATE Salutation: OR, A DIALOGUE between Sir W. W. and Mrs. Cellier. To the Tune of, The Fight is now ended. 1. OLd stories of State grow now out of date, And Factious Promoters obstructed by Fate; Great Charles in his Throne Protects Us alone, Without those wild Maggots that Calvin has blown; And now in the calm a Reflection I'le make, Of a kind Salutation in Newgate of late. 2. Twixt a Knight of the Cause, whose great Eminence, By Popish Rat-catching, and smooth Impudence; Belov'd by all those that are the Kings Foes, Yet in the Reception he dreaded some blows; For when Fire and Water by accident greet, Those unruly Elements calsh when they meet. 3. And down-right Dame Cellier, who still keeps her place, To which He prefer'd her with Marks of Disgrace: But now they are met in Newgate to Treat, Id'e freely give Six Pence you had seen the Sett. For She was Transported, and stood in a maze, Whilst He like and Owl among Lapwings did gaze. 4. He snuffl'd with's Nose, and made a long pause, In's New-fashion'd Cloak he wrap'd up the Old Cause, And cry'd Madam Cellier, I hope we are Friends; Wer't now in my Power I'de make you amends. Pray turn not my Stomack with lancing old Sores, My squezy Misfortunes are far worse than yours. 5. Great Sir! You are welcom unto this Great House, I scorn to throw Water upon a drown'd Mouse; None of my Relations I have seen this year, Could be half so welcom should they be brought here. Your great Vigilance, and your Zeal doth surpass, In Courage, Don Quixot; in Zeal, Hudibrass. 6. I'th silent of Night, no Goblin nor Spright, Could e're work such Wonders as you did Sir Knight, in finding out Priests without help of Christ. You were the Knight Errant on all such Exploits; No Janus's two Faces, nor Argus's strange Eyes, E're bilkt up their Fortunes, like you by surprise. 7. Though you were betray'd by Oates and his Bums; Those Amber Necklaces like Beads on your Thumbs, Supply'd you with Coyn Sir those Debts for to pay, Besides those Rich Medals in ambush for Prey; Or some score of Pounds Bedingf. (pull'd out on's Bed) Though two years at least after he had been dead. 8. Gusman to your Worship was but a meer Sot, He never had Sence to find out a Sham Plot; But you by the Art Sir of I egerdemain, What you put in the Meal Tub, could fetch out again; But all you near Jugglers Consederates do keep, As my Maid and you in the Meal Tub did meet. 9. The Knight in his passion found Truth would consute, St. Francis then enter'd to end the Dispute. Sir, This is no place for your Safety and Honour, She's void of the Light which the Cause upon her. Come give me your Hand Sir into my own Room, To consult who supply's our kind Ladies at home. 10. Now since we are inform'd the Knight in got loose, Yet finding some Clause of his Case in the noose Wrapt up in the tangle, Great Charles he did dunne, To Pardon his Treasons, what's past, and to come. But an answer most fit I hope he did receive, For a Treacherous Fool, and a sly buisy Knave. LONDON. Printed for the Use of the Students in Whittington's Colledge.
