LONDON: Printed for Randall Taylor, near Stationers Hall. MDCXCIV.
TO THE Right Honourable THE E. of M. &c. YOƲR Lordship being so Illustrious an Ex∣ample of Heroick Love and Renowned Va∣lour; 'Tis but fit that at your Feet our Adventurous Lover and most Valiant
Hero should fall: and that Good-natur'd Pity, and Sweet Compassion that moved you to Espouse the Justest Cause of an injured Stranger, will encline you also to Patronise The Hi∣story of his wrongs and In∣juries; and your Lordship can∣not be an Enemy to the Au∣thor, if you are but a Friend and favourer of ARMADORUS.
THE ADVENTURES OF THE Helvetian Hero, With the Young Countess of Albania, &c. NO sooner had the God of War raised himself from a a profound Repose, a Tran∣quility in which all Europe lay, too long alas, for the restless humour of the Aspiring Gaul, who in the midst of Peace betook himself to Arms; besieging Phillippolis (a Frontier of the Empire) flaming
Caesar and all his Allies, with the sur∣prizing insult of so sudden an Inva∣sion, so unjust a War: No sooner I say, had Mars set up his Standard, and Bellona displayed her bloody Co∣lours in the Field; (as if War in Con∣junction, were to denounce discord among the Sexes) or only designed it on the two sorrowful Subjects of this Discourse; whatever were the dispen∣sations of Fate, or its deep designs; cer∣tain it is, that the News of so Uni∣versal, so formidable a War, could not but reach the whole Helvetick Body; a People so truly Martial and Warlike, that they have no other Cradles but their Tents, and begin their Lives with a Campagne: A Na∣tion Neighbouring on a Great Em∣peror, and a King as Great; which lying open to two such potent Ene∣mies, had need of all its Arts as well as Courage to subsist, and had no little Reason to have some regard to its self, and so thought it best by a wise Neutrality, to prevent their becoming
a prey by a precipitous participiation, to the Avenging and Triumphant Victor, and falling so many Victims to the Force and Fortune of the Con∣queror, (tho' this policy I must con∣fess has sometimes proved as de∣structive to States, as 'tis many times thought a medium to preserve them, and makes them in the end to be aimed at as Sacrifices by both sides, because they sided with neither) but here, not∣withstanding the general body of this Canton'd State stood Neuter, it was left to their particular Subjects, in which Party they would Engage: And Gold and Gain being with them a good principle of Honor, as well as the best argument of a good Cause, (mixt with their Native hardiness, that on one side or other enclines them alway to Action) Their bold Youth betook themselves each to that Coun∣try and Cause, where they thought they might find the best Interest, and the best Pay.
Amongst which Martial Adven∣turers, it so sell out that the sprightly and active Armadorus made one: A Youth well made, and of a good Meen, Proper and Gay, qualified with a Sweet air, and a melting soft∣ness: The first, such as Brezes on their Mountains; and the latter to be compared to the Snow that lies upon them; while his Warlike disposition was all that was rugged about him, like the roughness of his Country. 'Tis true he followed Mars, while Venus seem'd to form a Camp for him; and the French Gallantry seem'd couch'd under the robust denominati∣on of a Swiss: Perhaps his Parents from their long services in that poli∣ter Country, had infus'd in his for∣mation some more polisht matter than what usually Compounds the Courser People of his own Coun∣try; but as soft as he seem'd, for War he was design'd; and so the first prompting Expedition that offer'd to his Inclinations, was the
Warlike preparation that was made by the Belgians, and the Heroick Prince that headed them, for a Descent on the Isle of Old Albion, now com∣monly call'd Brittain: A Command he soon got, either by desert or recom∣mendation, and accordingly entred upon the Action: The Success of which every Historian has in Volumi∣nous Diaries sufficiently related; it may suffice to say their Expedition was Prosperous; they Landed their Forces without Opposition; They march'd into the Country without Resistance: look'd on as Redeemers, and not Conquerors. So that the Young Hero had not the occasion of shewing the proofs of that Valour, that a brisk action might have Exemplifi'd; and so signaliz'd Himself to Her, that proved afterward the Mistress of his Affections; The first seat of War beginning in that very Province she called her own; but alas! little did either of them then think of those Sharper Engagements and Conflicts
that afterward befel them; Honour led him on; so that Love had no time to intangle him, or her; Tho' the little God perhaps had laid his Plot already, tho' the Execution of it by him was deferr'd: The Army by easy Marches advanc'd to the Metro∣polis; and our Noble Helvetian hardly gave or receiv'd the least wound in the Field; The Cause seemed to Conquer for them, while themselves profest they came not to Conquer; all the Conquest the Young Hero was re∣served for, was that of Beauty, and Armadorus to dye in no other Arms but Vicentina's. Thus having possest themselves of the Capital City, which there was no need of Force to make themselves Masters of; the willing Citizens re∣ceiving them with Gratulations, Pa∣geantry and Pomp; a peaceful settle∣ment soon followed this shew of War; (at least what was thought to con∣duce to it;) the Crown was placed on the head of the Deliverer, by a
publick Act of the Senate; and the People pleased with a new Corona∣tion; Festivals, Pageants, Triumphs and Rejoycings, were the only Di∣versions of the Town; drown'd all the noise of Drum and Trumpet; and the useless Army dispers'd, was Commanded to Reside in their Respective Quarters, in the several Country Towns and Villages of such Provinces as their General Officers thought fit: It was our Young Hel∣vetian's fate to be remanded to the Province of Danmonium; where they first Landed, and his Quarters As∣signed him in the Principal Town of it, Anciently the Isca Danmoniorum; little imagining what Snares the little God had laid for him against his re∣turn; what hard Conflicts he was to meet with after such easy Triumphs. Thou Powerful Love! Tho' In∣fant) God! How dost thou Govern and dispose of Human Affairs! And as inconsiderable and puny Deity as thou art painted, influence all
things! Fate and Destiny can do no more! Little did our Armadorus think that He, whom all the Beauties of the Capital City could not Conquer, or divert from his Martial Exploits and Employments, should be Trium∣phed over in a Country Town; Capti∣vated where he came as a Conqueror; Effeminated where he appeared so much a Man; And what might mag∣nify him more to Mars, or Venus, an Helvetian; but the Goddess here with the help of her Invincible Cupid, got the upperhand of our Hero; and the God of War; Shield and Buckler, Sword and Spear, the Ensigns of War; and the Streaming Colours that he carried all bowed, yeilded, laid down at the Feet of an Imperious Beauty, that could Command the Heart of the stoutest Hero: How this was effected, and by whom our Armadorus was Metamorphosed into a Lover, (for certainly it could be no mean Ob∣ject that could produce such Mon∣strous effects) shall now be the
Subject of the next Section, or Para∣graph. The Isca Danmoniorum (we have mentioned) of Ptolomy, and the An∣cients, is a well known place in Modern Story: A City of good Resort in the Western part of the Isle of Brittain; well Peopled, well Seated on the falling Descent of an easy Hill, whose pleasant Feet, and Fields adjacent, are wash'd with the sweet Streams of a purling River that runs by them; and glides with a various and delightful Current: many of whose Amorous Waves have often list'ned to the Lovers Tales, that on its silent Banks have been repeated. And in these Elysiums, and blessed Shades, the Virgin Youth of both Sexes, that frequented the City for Education or breeding; as also those of Riper Years, whom Love had Inchanted into those feeling Inclinati∣ons, and Passionate Emotions for Holy Matrimony, and the like, would often, and doubtless very Inno∣cently
divert themselves; but here it was not that our Noble Armadorus Received his Deaths Wound: His Dear lay in Covert, and the Dart was laid up for him and her, in Diana's Temple; so Sacred a thing is Love (if not profan'd) that it makes its first Sallies, and purer Essays, in places Dedicated to Devotion; and many a Pious Votary to return a Devotee to some other Divinity than what he seriously came to Adore. And this was the sad Condition of the Captivated Armadorus, when one day he came to Offer up his publick Oblations, to fall himself a Sacri∣fice to the Charming Eyes of the Fair Vincentina; and she as much a Victim to the Features of the Van∣quish'd Armadorus. The Emotions' of their Hearts, the glances of their Eye, the Trembling of the Nerves, and the Confusions that might have been visible in both their Faces, had not the Assembly been too much engaged in their Devotions to observe
it; these I say are only to be described to the Life, by such Dying Lovers; in a word, Haerebat Lateri Lethalis Arundo—was his case— And, Vulnus alit Venis—hers. That is to say, The Deadly Dart stuck to his Reins, Whilst Love fermented in her Veins. The Priest ending, parted this Tor∣mented Pair he should have joined who loath to rise from their bended Knees, Prayed only that the Prayers might be prolonged. And if Piety may be founded in Contemplation, no doubt were very Devout; Their Eyes followed eagerly their departing Per∣sons, and if Ogling-Love may be be∣lieved, their Hearts went after their Eyes. The glowing heat that nourish'd this concealed Love in their several Breasts, could not be long without breaking into flame; and though with the Poet it was Caeco curpitur Igne,
yet it must blaze at last, and come to light: The Contest was only between them, how with the greatest secrecy as well as decency they cou'd impar to each other their sufferings. Ar∣madorus, an humble admirer of Vicen∣tina, hardly could presume to be the first Aggressor, to address himself in a strange Country to a person o her Rank and Quality, and he him self a stranger, whose Fortune seemed to depend upon his Sword; besides Love is apt to Impress an awe and reverence on the Object you adore though the rank and Dignity of the person did not require that awful distance, which here it seemed to deserve. The Young Countess was not a stranger to the backwardness or Timorousness of the Youthful Arma∣dorus; she had considered well the decencies that were commonly ob∣served by those of her Sex; and though Love is proverbially said to (Laugh at Reason, and leap over Laws) yet the Lady strugled long before she
could dispence with the least puncti∣lio that might transcend the bounds of a becoming decency; but where Wit and Love meet (we know) the Inventions are wonderful; doubtless 't was pity compelled her to Com∣passionate the Languishments of the poor Armadorus; and she had greater Reason than the Charitable Samaritan, to pour some Comfortable Oyl into those wounds her self had made; and especially when Charity could begin at home too, whilst it was extended to the distressed stranger; for notwithstanding the severe rules of Modesty, Decency, and Restraint, the Troublesome Deportments, the Languishings of that Sex are obliged to; and she her self Laboured to be Confined to, as much as possible, or ever was in a weak Womans power; Yet the resistless powers of Love will always prevail against all the re∣luctancy that seems to oppose it. Vicentina felt the same pains, and which she knew no other way to cure,
but by easing those of Armadorus; but as Love raises difficulties, so it is apt alway to raise the best courage; and reach at the finest Inventions to Conquer them: Loath was the fair Countess to make a discovery of her passion, to a person a stranger to her self, and Alien to her Nation, and as loath to let the poor Languishing Stranger despond under such difficul∣ties as perhaps he might think invin∣cible; but to shew her self a Wit, as well as Beauty, and her Invention to be as strong as her Charms, the matter was so contrived, that Arma∣dorus had imparted to him the reci∣procal Affection Vicentina had for him and that the matter should be so or∣dered, that the Countess should not be seen concerned in so kind a Com∣munication. Drusilla, a young Gentle woman o a pregnant Wit, and good Invention was the Lady that had the Honour to wait upon the Young Countess, as at∣tendant on her Person; she often had
perceiv'd the Disorders of Thought, and the Discomposure of Mind, her Mi∣stress would be under, and soon judged they could proceed from nothing less than Love; and the Fair Sex have na∣turally such a fellow-feeling for one another's Sufferings, that they are sel∣dom easy till they help one another to be so; and besides, Inquisitiveness and Curiosity is so common an Ingredient in our Humane Constitution, and so more particularly in a Womans, that (if only to gratify their Humours) they'll leave few Secrets undiscover'd. Drusilla's discerning Eye had plaid the Mercury, and watcht the Darts that Cupid had Shot, and knew too pretty well what Lovers they had wounded. This made her with the greater liber∣ty, sitting one Evening in a lonely Walk by the side of her disconsolate Lady, who fetching a deep Sigh, gave her more pressing occasion to enquire of the cause of her so frequent pensive∣ness.
Madam, said Drusilla, pardon the presumption of your Servant, if she makes it her humble Request to be privy to that tormenting Grief that affects you; 'tis only that Zeal and Affection I have for your Service, en∣courages me to that confidence as to desire it, which should it prove a matter beyond my poor Abilities to serve you in, yet at last it would be some comfort to the afflicted to have a Partner in those Afflictions under which they groan. Ah Drusilla, re∣plied the Fair Vicentina, I am fully satisfied of thy Love and Faithfulness, and can confide further in thee, than even the secresy of my Affair would require; but alas! (redoubling it with a deeper sigh) such is my mis∣fortune, that I can perhaps be pitied, but not relieved. Love, then replied the Zealous and Passionate Drusilla, has drawn all this disorder on your dear self, Madam; and can that be the occa∣sion of your despair? Can you, Madam, who can command so many hearts,
doubt of Conquering one? See, but look down only on those Captives that already lie at your feet; what would the Amorous Carlo give for one such Sigh sacrificed for his sake? And doubt not Madam, but were your Esteem known to the Person you admire, he would soon Adore; he would sacrifice his very Soul to your Service, and Court you into that Bliss and Happiness you desire. The melting Countess began to be mov'd at such tender Expressions; and softly answer'd Drusilla, And canst thou help me, my faithful Companion? Should I have fixt my thoughts on a Person whom I could not handsomely Address unto, and yet bring me off with Honour? For that let me alone, sasid the Zealous Drusilla, greater Dif∣ficulties would I wade through for our sake, Madam; and to make the discovery more easy to you, give me leave by my own foolish Interrogato∣y to anticipate your disclosing the Passion you can hardly conceal: Is it
not for the young Stranger, Armadorus, you languish? And can you dive into my Thoughts so well, replied the Fair Vicentina (with a Countenance that seem'd a little surpriz'd into a graceful blush)? don't press me in a matter, Drusilla, that it neither becomes you to enquire into, nor me to own. It is enough, said Drusilla, (with a plea∣sing Smile) and I could suffer a severer Rebuke for your ease, Madam; but from my own Observation, the Young Cavalier looks very suspiciously, and seems to have no less a Passion for your Ladiship; the certainty of which, with∣out your being in the least concern'd, let me alone to discover. This pretty Discourse, and comfort∣able Consolation, past between the Young Countess, or the Fair Vicentina, and her Faithful Drusilla upon the Evening, that the following Morn the Citizens and Gallants were to Assem∣ble in the publick Temple, for the Celebration of Divine Service; Dru∣silla's pregnancy soon told her that
Armadorus his Devotions, or doubled Adoration, would make him to be present at the Solemnity, and this prompting-occasion (a Temptation to so pregnant an Invention as hers) soon made her lay hold of the oppor∣tunity, and enter upon Action: She gets her Lady to write a blank, or Anonymous Letter, to a Person as unknown, or else so well imitated her Mistresses Hand, that it might not be easily mistaken for anothers; Seals it, though Unsubscribed, and Directs it for the Young Armadorus: Then cunningly disguising her self, that she might not be known to re∣late to her Lady, she so lovingly de∣signed to serve, She habits her self all in the homely dress of some Pea∣sants Daughter: viz. In a fresh Straw-Hat, made but the last Harvest; a well stifned Pinner, and deeply blewed with the Starch; edged with a moderate narrow Bone-lace; a plain Handkerchief about her Neck, though of Course Linnen, yet very
clean; a Wastcoat of a Russet Serge, such as the Country affords, spik∣and-span-New, still savouring a little of the Weavers Oyl; a short Petticoat of Red Bays, edged at bottom with four rows of Green Gimp Lace; a pair of Yarn Stockins, Blew, bought that Night on purpose, from a Welsh-man's Stall; with a good substantial Neats-Leather Shooe, pur∣chased once at some Country Fair; tied close with a Green Ferret Ribbon, in a large. Bow-knot that touched the very tips of her Toes. Drest thus Cap∣a-pee, Drusilla, in these her Country Accoutrements seemed almost a stranger to her self, and her Ruddy Countenance, though it were not so Course, from its freshness of Com∣plexion seemed to humour the dis∣guise:
Eyes black as Sloes, with Cherry Lips; and Cheeks like Katherine Pear! That cry not only Kiss, my Love! but Eat me up my Dear! 'T would tempt not only Country Swains, but any Switzer here. In this Autumnal or Rustick dress she trips away to the Temple, much about the time the Young Girls of the Neighbouring Villages used to come, to gaze about the Quire; and at last fixing their Eyes on the finest Face, that has the loudest Voice, de∣voutly listen to the Vocal Musick of the Church, till the louder Organ Alarms them to turn about and look another way; but Drusilla, better acquainted with the Service and Ce∣remony, had other Contemplations: Her Eyes were fixed on the Comely Stranger, and it was not long before the Fair Stranger had found out hers; and though he was more Devoutly engaged in his Contemplations of
his more admired Vicentina, than at her Devotions; yet whether by In∣stinct, or wandring of his looks and thoughts, is not so certain, he could not forbear regarding this Country Damosel, with a concern of which then he could not comprehend the Reason; but much more surprized he was when the Service ended, and this delicate and unknown Dame pre∣sented him (with a simp'ring look and low Court'sy) these humble Lines. Sir, BE not surprized at the strangeness of this Address; 'tis in your power to make your self the happiess Man living; follow your Fortune▪ where you Love, you are as much be∣loved; lose no opportunity, lest you re∣pent your neglect and delay, and so b Wise too late; manage your Affair with Prudence; let your first Visits b
secret: and if your Love be warm, be confident it will find no cold Recepti∣on; Sir, Your hearty Friend, and well-wisher, D. WHILE the Eager Armadorus full of wonder and admiration was anxiously running over these My∣sterious Lines, and ready to break out into passion and Expostulation; the cunning Drusilla had withdrawn her self in the Crowd, and so added another piece of wondring, to his perfect Astonishment! And am I then, said he, made a Riddle to my self? Or this place some Fairy-Ground? Holy Ground it is, and Dedicated to some Sublimer Deity; and there∣sore no such Fantastick Scenes, Airy Phantoms, and Foolish Enchantments can take place here: This cannot come from my Admired Vicentina; but some Country Beauty that per∣haps
my person, though so unworthy, has seem'd acceptable and agreeable to: The Countess that has Charm'd me, keeps no such Domesticks; and this Gallant City yields no such plain Rusticity; but yet me-thoughts much Innocency and Sweetness seemed to dwell under that homely simplicity; and were I Master of that Heart which once I had, when the Field and the Camp afforded me the only delight, so pretty so fresh a Creature just come from the Country, could hardly have got off so easily; but purer Love, and now more sacred thoughts possess my breast; which though not tainted with the least of sin, I am sure I find to be the greatest torment: But why after all this, may not some envious Rival Spark have contrived this Stratagem to amuse and delude me, an unknown Stranger, only upon suspicion of that secret passion I have so long strove to conceal? These and such like thoughts and expressions, the troubled
and Confused Helvetian had to him∣self, and with which his melancholy entertained him for most part of the following Night; and there we leave him, while we return a little to the Countess, under as much discomposure and Anxiety. The Fair Vicentina hap∣pened to be not far from him in the same Church, when en passant with some other Ladies, she saw the Country Damosel with such Obeysance, and amiable simplicity Address her self to the Heroic Helvetian; and so far was she from suspecting it for her faithful Drusilla, under so well-con∣trived a disguise, that she gently justled some of her Virgin-Compani∣ons to observe somewhat of an In∣triegue, that seemed to pass between the Renowned Stranger, and a plain simple Country Girl. Under this perplexity both parties lay for some considerable time, while Armadorus his Suspended Thoughts hung in the midst between hope and despair; he sometimes resolved reso∣lutely
to Address himself to the Young Countess; when the fear of being presumptuous, dash'd agen that resolution: This timorous delay of his, made Drusilla play the second part, though not under so much dis∣guise as the first; and whether in a Letter under her Ladies hand, or under her own, that could well imi∣tate her Mistresses (since Report is various, I shall not determine) She Writes the languishing Arma∣dorus this second Epistle. Sir, 'TIs enough for Fortune to put their own happiness into Peoples hands; and not to Court them to lay hold of it: Fools indeed have their hours to chuse in, but Wise Men know how to Husband and make use of Minutes; It was once in your power to have been as happy as your own wishes could make you; but I can hardly say it is so now, since
your carelessness has delayed your Ad∣dresses so long, that the Cavalier Don Carlo (who has hitherto been but Coldly received) begins now every day to warm himself into her Affection: The Lady cannot be unknown to you, and alway so near by you; This is like to be your last advice, and you best know your last and only Remedy. D. This Letter more plain and Ex∣pressive, and like to give more Light to Armadorus, she delivers (directed to him) to a publick Porter to con∣vey, but one to whom Drusilla her self was unknown; and that the fellow might not discover to whom she related, she gave him this to carry at a place some tolerable distance from the House in which she dwelt: The Bearer conveys it as directed; but no sooner had the Transported Helve∣tian run over the surprizing Contents, but he seized the Messenger that brought it, for fear by his withdraw∣ing
he should be left agen in the dark: The poor man (employed as he thought only on some ordinary Errand) began to be seized with a fit of Trembling, to be thus taken into Custody; the eager Armadorus earnestly desires him to discover the person that delivered him the Letter he brought; and threatned him as much if he denied it, or did prevaricate; the poor fellow, as ignorant of the person concerned, as of the Contents, could not be brought to confess any thing but his Ignorance, and that he had no knowledge at all of the person that delivered it him, but only that by her habit she was a Woman, and some Gentlewoman; this not satisfying the warm Armadorus (who was resolved now to pursue as warmly his obscure Intelligence, and to be as hot upon the Cold Scent) he makes the poor unthinking Creature, the messenger, to accompany him to the place where the Letter was delivered him. Thinking thereby to be more
throughly Confirmed in the place from whence it came: but for that Drusilla, as I observed before, seem'd to have taken care: However the little stir that it made upon the fond inquisitiveness of the Eager Lover, and the poor Porter enqui∣ring about the Neighbourhood, it so fell out, that a person thereabout had seen such a Young Gentlewoman deliver him the aforesaid Letter, and affirmed it to be Drusilla, that be∣longed to the Young Countess of Albania. The Sun (on this discovery) seemed to display his Beams to the Clouded Armadorus, and to dispel all Mists; hardinessbegan now to grow upon him, and he began with hope to take heart; and soon after in his best Equipage went to make her a visit. But Oh! Tyrant Love! With what Cruelty does he sport himself with Lovers Hearts, and like a little Nero, play whilst they are a burning: This secret Intriegue (soon after the
bustle about the second Letter, ha∣ving taken some Air) This flame of this Amour was like to have been stifled in its first breaking forth; and their tender Love, that like a silent Taper had a long while been bur∣ning under ground, to have been put out by giving it vent, and opening the Cavity: The Fair Vicentina had still living a Mother, very careful of so fine a charge, if not watchful of her even to a fault. The Countess Dowager, who after the Decease of the Count D' Albania, was again Mar∣ried to the Worthy and Honourable Patriot, the Noble Count D' Orlando, Lord of Ogliano: This Old Lady, of great Judgment and Experience from her Years, and by Conversation well versed in the Affairs of the World, knew that her Daughter from the Sig∣niories, Lordships, Heritages and Pa∣trimony left her by her Father, was fit for the Espousals of some Consi∣derable Count; and besides, she well knew should the Young Lady mis∣carry
before Matrimony, (for 'tis a Proverbial saying in that Country, That the Young may dye, as well as the Old must) why then she was to take all by Survivorship, which would sufficiently have advanced the House of Ogliano; for which next to her own Daughter she had reason to have the greatest Love and Regard; but whether this (which perhaps might be but a malicious Reflection, made her averse to her Daughters Matrimony, or that a Motherly care made her willing to see her well Married; some little Intimation of Armadorus his Amours, and Intended Addresses, (notwithstanding all the care and cunning of Drusilla) came to her Ears; upon which having taken the Young Countess apart, one Evening in the most private walk of their Garden, a Comfortable Retreat behind their own House, from the noise of the Town; She began to tell her a little roundly of the Apprehensions she had of her,
as well as the Tenderness she had for her, and that she was afraid of some private Amours, that were going on between her and the Gallant Stranger that had made of late so fine a figure; to which she added her Cautionary Advice, to take care of Souldiers of Fortune; that notwith∣standing an handsome Person and Equipage, he might have but little to support either: That all Towns and Cities, especially Theirs, was known to be full of invidious Cen∣sures, and injurious Reflections. The Old folks, whose Virtues are com∣monly Necessity, reviling the innocent Liberties of the Young, for wanton Licentiousness; and the young ridi∣culing the staidiness and gravity of the Old only for a supercilious dotage. That the odness of Marrying an un∣known Stranger (whatever his merits or perfections might be) would sound as strange to all her Friends and Acquaintance; would make her the Subject of Table-talk, and be a slur
to the Young British Gallants of the same Province, as if all Albion could not afford her an Husband deserving enough, but she must ramble so far as to find out an Helvetian. With these courteous Admonitions and kind Reproaches, did the Countess Dow∣ager entertain her Daughter; who much surprized at the Discourse, and severe reprehension for a fault she was but beginning to commit, the very Intentions of which she thought none had been privy to but her self, and her faithful Drusilla: This sur∣prisal, I say, made the Fair Vicentina, whose Complexion was naturally en∣clining to a lovely white, o'respread her Lilly Cheeks with a little Rosy blush; but recollecting her self and Courage agen, she thought it best for the Young folks to be as cunning, as the Old are sly; and did not much doubt but the Countess Dowager, when at her Years, was as good at Dissembling as any, especially in matters of Love and Amour; in
which the severest Moralist allow it, even though they made a Lye for it, so long as it is only an Officious and Jocose one. This put the Young Lady upon Imposing on the Old, and upon this cunning Reply, That her Lady Mothers will should be alway a Law to her; that she had no thoughts of Matrimony, much less of any Clan∣destine Marriage, or so much as secret engagement: That she was obliged to so tender and careful a Mother, for giving her such good Advice, which should be her constant endeavour to follow, for the making both her Mo∣thers and her own Life comfortable: That Disobedient Children would bring their own Golden Locks, as well as their Parents Grey Hairs with sorrow to the Grave; That for her part, her own Countrymen appear'd to her the more amiable to make Husbands of: that to lye by the side of a Foreigner, an Outlandish-Man, differing in Speech, Custome, Manners and Behaviour, must needs be but a
cold Comfort, especially if they come out of so Cold a Country; that in∣deed, she had read and heard of Switzerland, and its Old Inhabitants the Helvetians; but that all the Ac∣count, both Ancient and Modern Authors gave of the Men, was that they had Grim and Grizly Counte∣nances, Bristly Beards, and Brushy Whiskers; so that her Ladyship had no Reason to fear she had any Incli∣nation for the new-comers from that rugged Country, of which they say this Stranger is one; Therefore, Dear Mother, do not afflict your self with such Jealous thoughts, for my Affecti∣ons shall be certainly placed on some smooth handsome English Man, and no rugged Bear of Bern or Switzer∣land. The Old Countess being a very good-natured Lady, and very Godly given, hearing her Daughter answer so Piously and so Religiously, so Learn∣edly and Rationally too; seem'd very well satisfied with that Evening-Lecture
she had given her; and was very glad the Young Lady abounded with so much Grace, as to unfold her Heart so Dutifully to her Mother, and to fold down in it all the proofs and reproofs she had given her, for Edification; not doubting but she would make good Ʋse of her Exhor∣tation; and that then there was no fear of any Application of any Helve∣tian whatsoever. Thus closed their Discourse, and upon them the Night together; all things seem'd hush'd for the Young Ladys happiness; but the Old Countess, though she went to bed seemingly satisfied, did not taste that repose the nest of Mortals enjoyed; Sleep! Sweet Sleep! That only Solace to the troublesome state of Human Life, had left her wake∣ful thought, and watchful Eyes; which neither Nights Sable Curtain, no more than those of her Bed could be said to close: Jealousy, which reigns in a Parents Breasts, has all the Torments of a Lovers too, and
perhaps more anxious and acute from the purer flame that kindles it: 'Twas a Child she was concerned for; 'twas a Child she feared might prove false to her, and treacherously miscarry; and the Violations of the Bed cannot be more afflicting, than the breaking through the Bonds of Nature, the Belly and the Womb; the former may cause the Head to ake, but the latter must make the Bowels yern: This banish'd not only Rest, but the very thoughts of it, with perplexing Arguments, and troublesome Objections of her own raising; and who knows, says she, to her self, but these fair Answers she gave me, may be full of Guile? pas∣sionate Love may prevail over the most Dutiful Affection: 'Tis an irre∣sistless Power, and so not to be trusted; and its powerful effects I found once to operate too strongly in my self, to trust it in my Daughter: It would make even a Saint to dis∣semble, and the sincerest Soul to turn
Hypocrite; she is Young, Fair, and Rich; her Youth may make her Amorous, her Beauty to be much Courted, and her Fortune to be very fairly stole and carried off beyond the Alps or Apennines, by some Swiss, or swaggering Rodomontado; and then farewel Daughter, farewel For∣tune, my joy, and my hope; and this Intriegue that is buz'd about, may notwithstanding her stiff denial, be a thing that has somewhat of truth in it, and is warning enough to me how to trust young Girls under Temp∣tations. With this she raised her self more early than ordinarily from her uneasy Bed, and put in Executi∣on a sudden Resolution, that was like to have changed all the Scene of this Amorous affair. As soon as she was up, she calls to Jacomo her Coachman, and gives him private Instructions to get his Equipage ready; and when her self with the Young Mistress was seated in the Coach, to drive directly away
for the Castle of Ogliano, their Coun∣try Seat; without expecting farther orders or instructions; all things being thus prepared, the Countess Dowager accosts her Dear Daughter, just then awakened from a pleasant Dream of Visionary Love, and the imaginary Embraces of her Dear Armadorus; She Dreamt of flowry Fields, and purling Streams: The Groves and Grotto's of beguiled Lovers; beneath the Amorous Shades of one of those, she fancied her self sitting by the side of her admired Hero; and he as full of passion, Contemplating the perfections of his adored Mistress: Their pointing Eyes were fix'd on each other, and shot those flames their breasts had kindled; their nimble Tongues supplied each others Story, and were always seconds to one another in some innocent and pretty Tale of Rival Lovers; of happy or unfortunate Amours. The Nightingale, that over their heads di∣verted them with his sweet Notes,
put them in mind of the misfortunes of Philomela; and the Silver Swan on the Streams below, made them remember how proudly Leda, once enjoyed a God: The Grove, that with its shady Trees prest upon the Grott wherein they sate, seem'd to insinuate to this Youthful pair, the happy state of Old Baucis and Phile∣mon, that under their rural Cot∣tage, grew Grey and Aged with un∣interrupted Bliss, and undisturbed Love; that such Innocent simplicity the Gods themselves did not disdain to visit, nor to Consecrate into a Temple so homely a Cell: when from this pleasing Covert, they were pleased to divert those fixed Eyes from their stedfastness of eager In∣tuition; (which like that of Angels they could wish might be Eternal) and suffered them to Expatiate a little o're the Fields and Meads that lay before them, at the opening of the Grove wherein they sate, where every Flower they saw seemed to
represent a new Scene of Love. The Hyacinth minded them of its pretty Metamorphosis; the Wild Mint bid them remember the Fair Minthe, a Nymph of that Name once as fragrant and as sweet: The yielding Anamone, wav'd about with every Wind, re∣collected to their thoughts the Amo∣rous story of Venus and her Dear Adonis, whose Purple Blood the Flower had imbib'd; the lovely Daffodil that grew by some adjacent Fountains side, did doubly reflect and represent both the Love and Disasterous Fates of the Enamoured Narcissus; so that they could not forbear from rising up themselves, and each of them to crop a Flower; and with a sort of self-Love, (though they only Loved most one another) to look a little in that fatal mirror that had cost the lovely Youth his Life. The Laurel, ever green, made them wish their Loves to last as long, and be so too; and seemed to exhibit to them the fear∣ful flight of Timerous Daphne; and
the eager pursuit of their Innocent Loves: and the Stock-Dove in the Grove, made them think on the change of Semiramis, or the Chariot of Venus: The Eccho often would repeat the pretty Terminations of their pleasant Tales; and at the same the pratling Nymph seemed to tell her own. The gliding River run their thoughts upon the Loves of Arethusa, and Egeria: The Murmuring Brook would needs mutter out some soft story, of some silent Lovers; and tell the Tales of Byblis and Meander; and the Fish that glided with the Streams (as mute as it is) would needs say somewhat too, and Record to these retired Lovers, the wondrous transmigrations of Nais and Dercetis; all that Lovers Thoughts, or Poets Fancies could invent, they seemed to have before their eyes; unless it were the fate of the Unfortunate Acteon, and the Discover'd Naked∣ness of the Revengeful Diana; but
Chaster thoughts attended their more Innocent Loves and Speculations; and no such wanton objects appear∣ed in this Dodona-Grove, to pollute their purer Imaginations. Thus lull'd almost a sleep, with the delightful variety of such innumerable represen∣tations of their Innocency and Love (this Fair Couple in this pleasant Vision, the Young Countess had) seem'd to lye down together on the Rosy Banks of a Murmuring Stream, where, with the blushing Roses, was confusedly intermixt the Amorous Myrtle, and minded them (even half a sleep as they lay down) of the sweet Bed of Venus; and the Pastoral Amours of Myrtillo. But this bright Scene of some blest E∣lysium lasted not long with the Charming and Enchanted Vicentina; for as she Dream'd on, she fancied all those soft enjoyments of sweet Con∣tent, seem'd on a sudden to vanquish and disappear. The Verdure of the Grove was changed into a Wither∣ing,
Wan, and Yellow Complexion; the very Trees look'd as if they were sickning with the Jaundice; the Leaves droop'd and dropt down before their Faces. The flowry Meads, and florid Fields, that smil'd under the feet of the Lovers that trip'd over them, began to look and languish, with a sullen aspect. The Raven, Owle, and Batt, and all the fore boding Birds of Night, and winged Omens of the Air, upon the Grotto where they fate, were sadly perch'd; and spitefully possest the Nightingale's sweet place; and chas'd from thence the Turtle and the Dove, and brought the Baleful Story of hapless Lovers, and blasted Love, to disturb their thoughtful Imagination. The frightful Fables of Corvus, and Nyo∣timine, with the transformation of Ascalaphus, awaken'd their slumbering Senses, and interrupted their so sweet Repose. The fate of Pyrmus, and fall of Thisbe, made both to start. The Ground so green but just be∣fore,
seem'd stain'd with Blood; and the dreadful Lyon with his guilty Jaws, but half withdrawn within the Neighbouring Thicket: The Streams that flowed with little falls and softest Murmurs, unknowing how to glide, began to turn to Pools, and Stagnate; instead of murmuring sounds, to Croke with Frogs that plunged from out the Weeds and Rushy Banks; as if the incensed Goddess had made another Metamorphosis of all the Rustick Inhabitants, for their surly rudeness: sad Progne Tereus, and poor Itis's Tale, took up her slum∣bering thoughts that only wak'd but now, to Dream so sweetly: The clear Sky, and serene Air, that just before glar'd, and enlighten'd all the Hemisphere, was dwindled into a few faint glimmerings, or a gloomy Mist, just light enough to let them see the harmless Grass whereon one while they soft and safely trod, strewed o're with Adders, Snakes and Serpents; whose hissing Heads,
and forked Tongues, did just o're∣top the bending blade which seem'd to move from off the spiteful Ve∣nom. While at her trembling Feet a grave Old Matron stood, with grim Medusa's Head, whose Curled-Locks seem'd falling on the Ground, and to produce those Vipers in the Grass. With this the frightned Vicentina wak'd, surpriz'd to see her Mother at the end of the Bed, and softly opening of the Curtains; which, (perceiving her Daughter to stir) she soon drew and saluted her with a Good-Morrow: The latter part of the Dream had put the Young Lady into a little Cold-Sweat; which the Old Counfess took notice of; but the Fair Daughter as handsomely palliated the matter, by imputing it to her putting her Head under the Bed-Cloaths, while she slept: but after this Melancholly Vision that followed so pleasant a Dream, the rising Sun shone in upon the Bed,
and promised a glad and joyful Day; which occasioned the Countess-Dow∣ager to have a finer opportunity, for in∣viting the Young Lady to take the Air in her Coach, in so lovely a Season. Vicentina, that was always obser∣vant enough, did not much resist her Mother's desires, and was as soon drest; and with her Dear Drusilla, accompanied her to the Coach: but still ruminating on the strange Dream, and the wondrous Revolutions that had befel her in her last sleep; the latter part she was glad was but a Dream, and as sorry that the former part of it was so too; for the veri∣fying of which sweet Repose she could have slept Eternally: some∣times she thought this happy pre∣lude of her Love, might portend as sad a Catastrophe; and then agen her Reason sway'd, and rejected Dreams as Foolish and Fantastick, and to have no other Effects or E∣vents, but in the idle predictions of their dull Expositors; but by this
time the Driver (well instructed as before) began by his making such haste, to let the Young Lady see she was not brought out only for to take the Air; for instead of gently driving round a pleasant Hill, whose top advanc'd up to Serener Air, was all o're-grown with wholesome Health, whose dry and Thirsty clefts gap'd down upon the watry Sea that wash'd the barren Mountains sertile fect; and so afforded the lov'd prospect to the longing sight, of di∣stant Waters bounded with the Skies. The furious Charioteer, (I say) in∣stead of sostly driving round the pleasant Mountains top, ran directly over it, with all the haste his Horses heels could make or carry: And then too late the Alarm'd Lady saw she was deceived, and carried only from the expected sight of her en∣amoured Lover, and a Youth she so entirely Lov'd. This struck a damp upon her Spirits, still disordered with her doubtful Dream; which as in∣significant
as she forc'd her self to think it, she found now to be too truly foreboding; and so not able to sup∣port her self under the weight of so much grief and fear, sell down into the Arms of Drusilla, in a deep and dangerous swound; out of which, by the time they were arrived at the Castle of Ogliano, by Drusills rub∣bing of her Temples, and  Old Lady's Administring to her strils a Bottle of Exalted Salts, or Spirits, she was somewhat recovered; under which Melancholly confinement we must leave her, to relate a little what befel the Noble and most Il∣lustrious Armadorus. After the Heroick Youth had Re∣solved with himself, (as above re∣lated) to venture on a visit where he found he was like to find a wel∣come; and that his being an unknown Stranger was like to be no such bar to his languishing hopes and airy fruition; it was his misfortune or fate to defer the making his perso∣nal
Addresses, even to that very day that his adored Mistress, who no less admired him, was so unexpectedly carried off, and ravish'd from his sight. The Apprehensions perhaps they had of giving some Umbrage of their Amour to the jealous Mother, made them a little more cautious of com∣ing together; but so it was, that whe  came, thinking to prostrate himself at the Feet of the Fair Vi∣centina, he found she had left the Town, and what was worse, could not learn any news whether ever she would return to it: This made him almost curse his Destinies for their cruel dispensations, and next, himself for his supine neglect: To imagine that his adored Lady had left him for some new Rival, he thought was too profane and injuri∣ous to so good-natur'd, to so sweet a Soul; and that so false an Heart could not inhabit in so fair and Ar∣gelick a Body; and therefore fixing his thoughts on the Faithfulness of
the Fair one, where he had already fixt his Heart, he resolv'd patient∣ly to enquire for what Intelligence he could get, and of the manner of her going off; and long it was not before he was informed (this Amour beginning to be the talk of the Town) that the Countess-Dowager carrying her out one Morning, upon pretence of taking the Air, had convey'd her to her Country Seat, their famous Castle of Ogliano; some Twenty Miles distant from the City, where she was detained under her Mothers Eye, with a great deal of Circum∣spection: That the Old Countess had made all her Domesticks to keep Watch and Ward over her; and that she had committed her more especi∣ally to the charge of one whose Duty it was to take care of Souls as well as Bodies; the Learned Sig∣nior Castrucio Castrado, a sort of Secu∣lar Priest, whose Godly Admoniti∣ons could not but make her lead a Life very Regular: That the Young
Lady when she perceived she was thus deceived, by the cunning of the Old, fainted away in the Coach, as she was hurried away. And what added yet more to the grief of the Young Armadorus, was, that he was also inform'd, all this severi∣ty was shewn her upon his Account; and that the Countess-Dowager car∣ried her away to this Confinement, meerly upon the Jealousy she had of his making her Addresses, and designing her visits; and this indeed was the most insupportable part of his sufferings, That he, the wretched Armadorus, should not only be the cause of his own misfortune, but so unfortunate as to make so sweet a Creature suffer for his sake: A Creature dearer to him than his Life, and for whose sake he was so ready to Dye. Thus Instigated by Love, and stimulated by Revenge, he resolv'd to Storm the Castle of Ogliano; and as a true Knight-Errant, either to
relieve the distressed Damosel, or perish in the Attempt; and forth∣with order'd his Palfrey, which was of pure white, dappl'd with black spots, the very Emblem of his Mi∣stress in Affliction, to be richly comparison'd in Accoutrements suit∣able to the Cause he had in hand, with this Device in his Shield, Inno∣cence Opprest: but as he was going to bestride his Pegasus well Arm'd, (for if Love has Wings, a Lover's Horse may have so too) upon which sitting like another Perseus, going to deliver his Dear Andromeda, there came to his Horse's side a little Youth, or Squire, delivering him a Paper Seal'd, which having opened, found it contained the following words; Sir, IT is too late, Illustrious Armadorus, to conceal those passions we have hitherto so cautiously disguised; I have been well informed of that Affection
you have born me, and with so much modesty supprest, lest your Love might be look'd on as presumption: but now that the noisy talk of a busy Town has made▪ our most secret Amours, (to our selves hardly known) the subject of their Discourse, 'tis no longer in our powers to suppress even our most silent thoughts; and without the least breach of modesty, I am not ashamed to own, That Armadorus his Affection, (of which my Eyes without much Infor∣mation have been witnesses) doth de∣serve a better retaliation than is now in the power of poor Vicentina to return; my Mother's jealous thoughts has hur∣ried her on to these extreams, to draw me from the harmless freedoms of your diverting Town, to confine me to her House, a sort of Country Prison; but my only Comfort under so melancholly a restraint, is, that I may yet be so happy as to have another sight of the Noble Armadorus, whose absent Per∣son is supplied by the presence of his Idea in the breast of Vicentina.
Love and Honour had agreed to pull on both Boots before; but these warm Lines like the Spirits of good Wine, put such a Spur in our Hero's head, that was ten times better than the tother two in his heels; which he clapp'd both presently to the side of his Horse, and so salli'd forth out at the Western Port, im∣patient till he arrived to the pre∣sence of that Fair Creature, whose obliging disposition was such as to Compassionate a poor Stranger's sufferings, and to Crown his Affecti∣ons with her own Love. On the Road we must leave him, to return a little while to the Young Countess, and her faithful Drusilla, who had prevailed with Vicentina, since their passions for one another could not longer now be kept a se∣cret, to let the Youthful Armadorus no longer languish in his prime: and having somewhat of a Voice, Sung for the diversion of her me∣lancholly Mistress, while they were
sitting in the Green-Chamber, which was allotted them for their use; a kindness shewn her even under so severe Restraint; that Colour of all others being the best for the Eyes, which with Tears and Sorrow are frequently injured; and to divert both those, Drusilla, I say, Sung her two or three of those pretty Songs, such as, Gather your Rose-buds while, &c. O be kind my Dear, be kind, While that I and you are Young; And seeing a Tear or two stealing from her half clos'd Lids, struck up her Notes to some words more newly Composed, apposite as she thought to the occasion, viz. Why are my Eyes thus alway flowing? Why doth my Heart so trembling move? &c.
The Diversion that Drusilla had given her, even with the Repetition of her Torments, in such Sonnets of Love as she thought best suited her occasion, though never so old or ordi∣nary, shewing her affection for her dear and distressed Mistress, more than any excellency in her self for skill or performance: yet it had that effect, that it rouzed a little her Mi∣stress's dejected thoughts; and made her take down her Lute, that seem'd to hang melancholly by the Wall, conscious of, and disconsolate for its Ladies sorrow; and laying it careless on her Lap, with a sort of negligent indifferency, and with a Voice at last that neither sighs nor sorrow had alter'd from its excel∣lency and perfection, Sung to the warbling Instrument, on which she Play'd as well, this Mournful Air, in return to Drusilla's merry Wagge∣ries, with which she so laboured to divert her.
I. Tho' Confin'd my Body be, My uncontrouled Soul is free; And Conscience must have Liberty. II. Love! surely then may crave the same, Love! that move's the mighty frame; And Love! that too from Heaven came. The Old Countess Dowager pas∣sing by the Door from another Room, hearing her touch the Lute, made a step back to listen a little to the good effects of that Liberal Educati∣on she had given her; and though she was mightily taken with the gra∣vity of the Notes, and the Piety of the Words, yet as Pious and Consci∣entious as she was, her hard Heart would not give her tender Conscience leave to comply with the Passion and Amour of her dearest Daugh∣ter.
While the Fair Vicentina, with her faithful Drusilla, were thus entertain∣ing their too sensible melancholly with a sort of Diversion, they hardly had any sensibility how near their real Joy was Approaching them. But whether some airy Genius, what Old Philosophical Heads perhaps dotingly called Intelligences, which may move Sublunary beings, especially Human, as well as Celestial Orbs, or the di∣stant Communication of Aerous, or Aetherial Attoms, agitated into eager and Tumultuous Motion by the Ap∣proaching Body, might by their Im∣pulse of Matter make some Impres∣sion on remote Minds; and so verify a common Aphorism, by material Af∣fections upon our sensible Organs, and make us visibly and palpably perceive, That Friends are never nearer, than when they are talk'd of. (Though by the way, I think the Devil is said to be so too). It was Drusilla's chance, or necessitated Impulse, after this sweet effort upon her melancholly
Instrument, to put her Mistress up∣on the pleasing Discourse of her Ad∣mired as well as Enamour'd Arma∣dorus; And what, says she, Madam, Who knows while you are lamenting your Captivity, but that your Redemp∣tion draweth nigh, and the Noble Ar∣madorus may go through all difficulties to compass our deliverance, and Crown your happiness? The insinuated thought had that warm effect, and sensible Impression, as to fetch a deep sigh from the bottom of her Young Ladies disturbed Breast, which like the late Miraculous Board could not but Groan when touch'd with so hot an Iron; when suddenly they were surprized with a precipitous knocking at the Great Gate of the Castle of Ogliano, which caused as great Pulsation at their Young and der Hearts; but much more did they pant, when they saw the longed for Armadorus enter, with a Meen that carried Love and Victory before it. The Young Hero entring with the Civilities of
a Courteous Stranger, could not but be as Courteously received, having with him a Friendly Companion that accompanied him in the Jour∣ney; and coming as a Foreigner, that curiously desired to see the Re∣markable Seats and Situations of the Country; and the Old Conntess that much mistrusted his Errand, yet be∣cause she thought it a thing then not so publickly known, could not her self so handsomly refuse him the Civilities of the House; In which being entred, and sate down, the eager Armadorus, that had no longer design to trifle and delay, declared to the Countess-Dowager, that the Errand that brought him there, was the Honourable Design he had of making his most unfeigned Addresses to the Incomparable Vicentina, her most Admired Daughter; and that he desired no longer to Live, than he was ready to Sacrifice that Life, only to Dye at her Feet.
The Old Lady seemingly took no further notice of this; but only to return these warm expressions, with this cold Compliment, That Young Gallants were thus used to rally on the frailties of weak Women; and to ramble into wild discourses of their praises and perfections, only to shew their own Eloquence, and by commending their Sexes Excel∣lency, to take an opportunity of set∣ting forth their own Abilities: and so with an Amorous Smile, and a grave bow to the Fair Helvetian, would have forced off the Discoure from her Daughter's Amours, and (but that she was Married to the Noble Lord of Ogliano) could have wish'd the Addresses made to her self. (For the Charms indeed of our Hero was such, that they could excite Inclina∣tion even in Frosty Age, and Frozen Blood, as well as in the warmest Veins:) But Armadorus had other things to do now, than to dally, and that with an Old Gentlewoman;
and so abruptly replied; Madam, The Affection that I have declared for your Fair Daughter, though it seem not to affect you, yet I assure you is not meerly Complimental or Counterfeit, but a real Passion: It has been my Honour and Happiness to have several times seen her; but alas! the first sight was sufficient to make such an Impressi∣on of her Beautiful Idea in my Heart, that all the remainder of my Life can never raise or eradicate. He would have gone on; when the Tart Old Lady, with a Brow that wrinkled without a Frown, took him up as sharply: Sir, said she, Your strange Address is very surprizing to me; espe∣cially that am unknown to you: and from you above all, who both by your own Accent, as well as others Re∣port, are not only a Stranger to me, but the Country; and if you have such an Affection for my Daughter, I must assure you, 'tis most Unfortunately plac'd, for to my knowledge she has nothing like it for your self. This seemed a
little Poinant Sauce to that delicate Raggust she had given him at first Reception; and was so far from pleasing his Gusto, that it set his Teeth the more an Edge; so that the whetted and warm Armadorus, as sharply, (though a little too incor∣siderately for his Ladies sake and safety, and indeed his own) and hastily replied; Know, Madam, then, that she has an Affection for me, though it can never equal that of mine for her; and lest you should look upon these words too, for fineness of Speech, and Fantastick Compliments, here are Acts, Evi∣dences, and Records for what I say; and so in a sudden Passion, that sa∣voured more of Heat then Judge∣ment, (for Love transported, many times terminates into Rage) pull'd out of his Pockets the Three Letters that came to his Hands, and offer'd them to her View. The Alarm'd Old Countess finding what she had so long look'd for and mistrusted, so fairly now to offer it self, suffered
her Curiosity so far to overcome her resentment, as to examine them; and seeing them somewhat to agree with her Daughter's Hand, if not the very same, dissembles her Passion, to discover the depth of her Daugh∣ter's, (though two very different Af∣fections of the mind) and so parting from the passionate Stranger, tells him she'll Examine the Lady Vicen∣tina, upon the Contents of those Papers. Rage now possessing her, instead of Reason, away she runs up to the panting Vicentina, whose Heart seemed to labour under a Thousand concerns for her Lover, for her self, under Hope, Despair, Love and An∣xiety; so that the Pulsations of her Breast could keep no Time; and went faster than the Pendulum of her Watch: when the Old Lady en∣tred, and began to ring the Ala∣rum. See, false Vicentina! See perfidious Girl! To what a sad pass you have
brought your self and me! see the Instruments and Records of your Treacherous dealing with your own Mother, under your own Hand; dis∣sembling Creature! here are sufficient proofs of that Intriegue I tak'd you with in the Garden, which you as Impudently disowned to me, and denied; go on, and follow your own measures, but expect never more my blessing or favour, or so much as hereafter to see my Face. Vicentina, suprised at the sight of those Letters she thought would not so soon have come to light; (which the passionate Imprudence of Armadorus had indeed too rashly discovered) was at first too much confounded for a reply, but at last recollecting her self, answer'd, Dear Mother, have but a little modera∣tion! and let your wonted Prudence prevail over that present passion that sways you: Consider you are a Mo∣ther, and that it is your own only Daughter with which you are so
enrag'd; and then you'l soon see, that similitude of Hands is not suffi∣cient to Convict any Person; and that Letters have been often Coun∣terfeited in matters of greater mo∣ment and concern, by dextrous and designing Knaves: And who knows but this poor Gentleman may be as much deluded as I am abused; for I disown them utterly (looking upon those Drusilla had Composed). This calmed a little the Impetuosity of her Passion; and will you then aver this (said the Old Countess a little more Calmly) to the Gentleman's Face? Yes, indeed, said the cunning Vicentina, (who desired nothing more than to see it) I am ready to aver it to his Face, and that my Hand was never to those Writings; come then with me, said the Countess-Dowager, and put an end to your Mother's trouble, and your own di∣sturbance; and let this deluded and abused Young Gentleman know what he has to trust to; how much he
has been deceived; and that he puts an end to that Passion which will only run him into so many Incon∣veniencies, and in which he can never hope to accomplish his desires. This word never sounding like Eter∣nity, and Everlastring Torment to Vicentina, had almost put her into a Swound, in which indeed she might have past away to her Eternal Rest: but her Mother's bidding her to follow▪ made her pluck up her Spi∣rits, and go after; and Drusilla attend∣ing both, descended into the great Hall. Neither the Readers of Romances, nor of all the Fantastick flights of Poetry and Love; can truly de∣scribe that Embarrass, that perplexity, those surprized Lovers lay under, when they saw themselves so near together: Their Colours came, and went with their Eyes, changed like the Camelions with the motions of their Body; or like variegated Silks, with the diversity of Light. Arma∣dorus
of a Complexion Fair and Rud∣dy, Enamel'd and set off with a deep black; and Locks that fell before his Face, like Curled Jet, that seemed to make a border to the Rubies of his Cheeks; could not at the sight of his adored Mistress, and the Consciousness of somewhat he had done amiss, suppress his boiling Veins from sending up into his well-tempered Countenance, a guilty and disordered Blush: Vicen∣tina, of a most Comely Visage, and the Fairest Skin, such as usually ac∣companies those of that Fair Sex, who have the glorious gift of Golden-Locks and Amber Hair; could not but Re-salute her Amorous Armadorus with as modest a Blush, and as con∣cern'd one tool, knowing what she was about to do, that is, to deny their Correspondence, and that Love he knew she bore him: The dif∣ference in their Countenances mostly appeared in this; that the Helvetian from his Sanguine Complexion, was
a little too much flush'd from the eager Blood that so furiously flew thither; while the Young Countess's upon this Interview, seemed only to tinge her Cheeks with the Veins that rose to visit her Face, and to Damask that Lilly-white Skin with a little Rosy Stian, to Paint with her Blood instead of Wool and dau∣bing; and by that acquired Beauty alone, she added a new lustre to her Native and Natural brightness. But the Grave Matron, the Lady-Mother, soon interpos'd between these kind Communications of their Souls (that seemed a transfusing with their Blood) by stepping in between their Bodies; she was afraid they might commit Matrimony with their Eyes, since her Rigid Divines had told her that Fornication and Adultery could be committed with a look. And she had heard somewhat of the Court∣ship of Italians, That could blow Kisses from one side of the Street to the o∣ther; Communicate a thought with the
twinkling of an Eye; send a Billet doux with the lisp of a Lip, and tell a long Story on the tops of their Fingers: This made her the more eager to make an End of the business, before it was began to be Examined; she had learnt the Lesson at the last Lecture, Evil Communication corrupteth good Manners; and so without any more Ceremony, accosts her Daughter. Here is a Strange Man, says she, Vi∣centina, that not only pretends Love to you, but what is more strange! says you are as much in Love with him! and what is strangest of all, shows Letters under your Hand for it (as he pretends); but as you satis∣fied me, Daughter, before I came down with you, so let the poor Gentleman know, that this is some Forgery and abuse put upon him by some of the Debauch'd wild Fellows of the Town, and the naughty Wo∣men, with which it abounds, that have no Grace of God before their Eyes; 'tis pity such a Gentleman of
so good a Presence, and Stranger too, should have such tricks put up∣on him; but 'tis a such filthy Town, sye upon it! The Young Lady (abounding with as much quickness of Wit, as the Old one did with an hasty Passion) finding her self reduced to this pres∣sing extremity, either to offend and Exasperate a Mother already too much enraged, or else to run a Man she lov'd the most of all men, into the greatest Confusion and Despair: wisely chose rather to offend him for a little while, whom she thought she could soonest please, than her Mother, whose fury if she had far∣ther provok'd, she thought never to be appeased; and so made this dextrous Reply, and well-contrived Discourse, with a Meen and Counte∣nance made up with a well com∣pounded Temperament of a filial Duty and a Faithful Love, such as might handsomely serve the Turn, and was adapted to the Time.
Madam, said she, I must always acknowledge your tender care in my Education; and that I cannot make sufficient returns for that Motherly Affection you have always shown me; and should I do any Act contrary to your good liking, much less be guilty of downright Disobedience, I must needs be the vilest Creature Living. And as for this Gentleman, with whom you challenge me to have had such intimate Correspon∣dence, as to send him the Letters here produced, I do declare before him and you, (taking up one of those Drusilla had imitated her hand in) that this is none of my writing; that some person has Counterfeited my Hand to abuse both the Gentle∣man and my self; and as for this worthy Gentleman, (for so his pre∣sence bespeaks him;) He is a Stranger to me, and with whom I never had any Converse: 'tis true indeed, I have seen him often in the great Church, Madam, when at my Devo∣tions,
and frequently seen him pass the Streets, without being ever in his Company; nay, I have praised him, as well as heard him Commended for a Comely Person (and the Gal∣lant Stranger, I think may deserve so much Commendation); but I hope, Madam, all this may be done, with∣out any injury to Modesty; much less be so maliciously interpreted, as to be made matter of Love and Amour. If the Noble Foreigner (for I must give the Gallant Person, though un∣known, so much his due, that I think him of no mean Birth and Descent) has made himself so un∣happy as to be in Love with me, that am never like to be his, and who am subject wholly to your Ma∣ternal disposal, it must be attributed to his misfortune, and not to my fault; all that I can say to him is, that perhaps he deserves a better Mistress to Crown his Affections, and that in his own Country, where his Perfections being more known,
are certainly more Esteem'd and va∣lued. She would have gone on, and per∣haps in some further Panegyrick: but the Countess-Dowager began to be afraid of these fine words; and was glad her Daughter disowned the Letters, and was willing she should break off with our Hero, just where she had Complimented him back again into his own Country, and where the Old Lady wish'd him with all her heart. And so was as offi∣ciously ready to shew the Stranger out of doors, faster than he came in. Armadorus, that was got on so far in his Affair, in a strange Coun∣try to meet with such an Embarrast Intriegue, was almost estranged from himself; and like Strangers in an House where they were never before, knew hardly the way where he came in, or by which way he was to get out; when the Young Lady's heart began to ake, for the very Per∣plexity
that his was in: and with as much Wit as Good-humour, told her Mother, That she hop'd she would look on it only as a Specimen of that Good breeding she had bestow'd upon her, and not in the least an Indication of her Love and good liking to the unknown Stranger, if she thought it was but handsome if her Ladyship shewed him the Civi∣lities that are commonly due to Strangers; and which she thought even she her self might do without any breach of Modesty, upon Con∣dition he would cease all other pre∣tences; and that without the Inti∣macy of Love and Affection; Pity and Compassion required some Cour∣tesy to be shown the Gentleman that had been so basely Imposed upon, and Deluded. This made the Old Countess relent a little, and make the Astonish'd Armadorus a cold In∣vitation to stay Dinner. But his Stomack was full with the Breakfast they had given him: However this
cunning Discourse of Vicentina, gain'd that point, that the stay was pro∣longed; and that the Mother's Eyes did not so exactly watch the Lovers: when Armadorus perceiving some E∣motions in the breast of Vicentina, (who had withdrawn her self, ei∣ther by Accident or Design, to the remotest part of the Room) eagerly steps up to the Window where she stood, and with a submissive Voice, as well as gesture, thus briefly and passionately Expresses himself. And is it true then, Madam, that I am this Poor, Miserable, Deluded; and abused Person? Are none of those dear Lines then your own; that I have hugg'd so long, as the Records of my Happi∣ness, Treasured as the Evidences of my Life? Ten thousand times more dear to me than those of my Estate? Alas! wretched Armadorus, doubly wrack'd to perish in the Port: Con∣sider, Compassionate Madam, a Pe∣rishing, sinking Man; A Shipwrack'd Stranger, beaten on your Shoars; and
lend one helping hand to keep the next Wave from washing him away: Tho' I may have been so miserably im∣posed upon as to found my Happi∣ness upon a malicious piece of Forgery of your Letters; yet I am sure, I am not mistaken in your Ladyship, in your Person; that is too pure to be Counterfeit; and the first sight I had of it, made too deep an impression in my breast, that I should be de∣ceived in its Idea. If Vicentina's Heart was so soft be∣fore, you may be sure it was now melting away at these tender expressions from a person she as tenderly Lov'd; her Eyes trembled and twinkled like two little Stars, that were fixt on him, tho' they moved in their own Orbs; her Lips quaver'd for an answer they were hardly able to de∣liver, and her Tongue that would have spoke, falter'd; her Breasts heaved and strugled with those sighs she so violently endeavoured to suppress; her heart failed her for having uttered so much
already, as to make her Dear Arma∣dorus believe she had failed him. But perceiving her Mother to be more regardless since the matter seemed to be cleared now; or else casually gone out of the Room, she took Courage to make this Ingenious Reply and Confession; Sir, You are indeed, as I have truly confessed to my Mother, an utter Stranger to me: having never till now had any Dis∣course with you; this you know to be true, as well as my self; and your indiscretion (which pardon if I call it so, when perhaps it might be imputed to the ardour of your Affection) ha∣ving so rashly exposed those Letters to my Mother's view, has put me in∣to great pain how to Extricate my self and you from that labyrinth of difficulties to which that rash adven∣ture has exposed us to; I can't but confess that I have a great deal of esteem for your Person; and were you not a Stranger to our Nation, it might bear the name of Love;
but alas! such is my misfortune, that I dare not call it by the right name; and for those Letters you have pro∣duced, though I might really disown them, as I did, they having not been Penn'd by me, at least the first; yet I must own I was not altogether a stranger to their Penning; and what I've said, and done, has been both with a salvo to my Conscience and Reputation, as well as for your In∣terest, and a further Correspondence. The transported Youth could hardly contain himself, but bursting out into this Extatick Expostulation; And am I then brought back from the Gulph of Despair, to be plunged into an Abyss of Eternal Happiness? He would have dilated himself into more Pathetick Exclamations, and turned all the Art of Rhetorick into Ecphonesis and Hyperbole; but time cut him short, and put him upon the Aposeiopesis;—leaving her to Expound what he would have said had he not been forc'd to this abrupt
silence: but, Madam, added he (to begin where your Ladyship ended) where may be this happy place, where I may have one hour of your farther Conversation, or Correspondence? Is there no Grove, nor Grot, no Wood, nor Covert, no quiet Retirement near your House, where I may have some secret access to your Person? for tho' our Affections are no way Criminal; more Innocent than those of our first Parents in Paradise; and that we need not so much as a Fig-leaf to cover us; yet I'le venture through any dangers and difficulties to bring my Affairs to that happy period, and prize that one moment of my Life, more than all my Years that are past, or whole Ages that are to come: The Young Lady, like Lovers that are loath to lose time; let him know, that behind their Palace-Garden, (or just at the end of it) there was a little place of no common access to which if he would repair such a Night, she would be found there; in the mean
time advising him to take the sooner leave to give the less umbrage to the Mother, who by this time too was returned into the Great-Hall; and seeing her Daughter as it were in some Discourse with the Stranger, moving up toward them,—Arma∣dorus Addrest himself in this manner, Madam, since it is my misfortune to be so treacherously imposed upon by some abusive Villains, that designed maliciously to abuse your Daughter as well as my self; I am resolved to make my utmost effort for the dis∣covery of those Execrable Authors, not so much for my own sake, as for the good Ladies that suffers with me: It was indeed my hasty Ambition, raised by the excellencies of this Ladies perfections, that made me so easily credit those Counterfeited Im∣postors; my Credulity I now as much Condemn, as I do my Destiny, that has brought me to this unhappy dis∣appointment; I only wish this Fair Lady a Person answerable to her
Birth and deserts, and humbly take my leave of both. The Old Countess glad to see the Affair so finely dash'd, was as loath now to part with the Youthful Hel∣vetian; and could have wish'd her self almost Unmarried for his sake: but the Young Hero, the better to take of all suspicion, pretended the Post he was in, and his relation to the Publick, required his presence, and precluded him from those Civili∣ties she intended him; and so with a languishing Eye, and as sorrowful Heart, he made his Obeysance to her that commanded it, with a Courteous though more negligent bow to the Old Lady, and so left them: but far from those disconsolate thoughts that he once thought he should have parted with; his whole mind, and all the faculties of his Soul were rumi∣nating upon the happy hour, and the place wherein he was to have the Company of her, for whom he could have gone a Pilgrimage over the
Globe. The Evening being coming on, it being not long after the last interview; the Gallant Armadorus (that never violated his promise to any Man, you may be sure would less fail a Woman, and one to whom his very Soul was devoted) set forth from the City where his Post was, toward the place where his tender Heart was to be: a more agreeable encounter than the pointed Pike, or Steeled Javelin; and the soft Lips of his beloved Lady made him March more contenredly than he was wont against the Roaring Mouth of a Cannon: Tho' Pallas and Bellona, with our Hero, had their Charms too, as well as the finest Juno, or fairest Venus of them all; but here in his Adored Mistress he thought them all met, all that was Deity, all that was Divine. It was about the dusk of a Ruddy Evening, that promised a fair Day, when the sinking Sun had fringed the neighbouring Clouds with a glorious Reflection, that he rid-out from the
Renowned City, toward the sweet place of his Amorous Rendezvous; and his Journey being Westward, had the glaring beams of that little glimmering Light that was left, reflected on his Face; this he looked on as a good Omen and Presage to his future Suc∣cesses, of which he was as Ambitious, as that Persian that obtain'd a Crown by first seeing the Sun to rise; and so indeed might well Worship it: all that was bright, all that was glo∣rious to him, was to meet him amidst the very Shades of Night; and which like a Phospherus could shine best even through the thickest Darkness. All things were husht, and Nature in repose, nought but these watch∣ful Lovers was awake; the very Birds of Night were percht and fast asleep, forgetful of their time to roam abroad?—Forgive, Drusilla, that we thee forget, thou careful, faith∣ful Creature to them both, and 'twas for both of them you Centry stood, you with them wak'd for
both.—Whilst in this quiet sea∣son of still Night, the lovely Arma∣dorus did arrive, so still it was, they heard his Horses hoofs that at a distant did rebound and shook the trembling Earth, and Vicentina's sympathizing Heart. The gay Helvetian, led by Love, (as blind as the little god is said to be) prov'd a good Guide and Guar∣dian Angel, bringing him directly to the Postern-gate of that Garden, where they had appointed to meet: Armadorus approaching, could distin∣guish even the soft whisperings that past between Drusilla and his dear∣est Mistress from the easy repercussi∣ons that were made on so free and open an Air; and found his heart affected with a more than ordinary transport at so joyful an approach; no sooner did he alight at that Gate of his Paradise, where there was no Angel, no Flaming Cherub placed to drive him off, but invite him in; no sooner did he make a sign of
Knocking, and a soft Whisper through the Keyhole, but Drusilla was ready to let into the Arms of her Mistress, the Noble Youth, whom she knew to be Master of her Heart: Armado∣rus, after his awful Respects paid, with the License of a Lover, took the liberty to take the fair Vicentina by the Hand, and conducting her to a soft Bank of Mossy-grass, and the most convenient place for them to seat themselves on at such a distance from the finer Walks of the House, where they might not be heard, much less seen; The Young Lady, with the liberty that one might well be al∣low'd to take that lov'd so well, be∣gan to chide more lovingly, than an∣grily, his rash discovery of those Letters to the Lady-Dowager, enough to have undone them both for ever, had she not so shuffl'd the Cards, as to get a good after-game at last. Armadorus had nothing to urge in his Defence, but his Passion for her self alone, that transported his Resent∣ment
beyond his Reason; and hoped that since he was so willing and rea∣dy to bear her kind Rebukes; she would as kindly, and as easily forgive his Transgression, into which the blindness of his Love and Passion had caused him to fall; and that now, since it was their happiness, as to be able to concert Matters together more freely; they would be capacitated to manage them the better for the fu∣ture. They were both agreed (you may be sure) to be very indulgent to one another, and neither could ask the least modest Request, which, ei∣ther for his part was not as ready to grant; so this Pardon was granted as soon as askt. Armadorus pressing of her fair hand, could not but imprint on her Cherry Lips an eager Kiss; which she suf∣fer'd rather to be stolen then allow'd, only perhaps that it might seem the sweeter: The Starry Sky, with the Lustre their own brightness and beau∣ty brought with it, afforded them
Light enough to discover one anothers Pefections; and thus sate these em∣bracing Lovers repeating their past Adventures with a pleasantry that sweetned the Discourse from the dif∣ficulties they had past; and contri∣ving how to prevent all Dangers; Disturbances, and Interruptions for the future. Whilst Drusilla had now changed her Post, and was keep∣ing of Watch and Ward near the great Door of the Garden that came out from the Castle of Ogliano; and as vigilantly proud of her Office, as the Centry-Goose that sav'd the Ca∣pitol. Thus sate the Lovers safe, claspt in each other Arms, whilst their very Souls seem'd to sympathise with the motions of the Body; shrunk up, and hugg'd themselves in silent Joy to find them∣selves blest with so much success, and so near the Consummation of their perfect bliss. Vicentina, from the si∣lence of the Night, and the solitude of the Place, could not but recollect
the foreboding Dream she had the Morning before her Mother hurried her away; and at length repeated it to her Dearest Armadorus, who pleas'd with the beginning of it, dissatisfied with the end, and surprised at the whole, comforted her in these words,—Had it not been, Dearest Vicentina, the designs of our Fates and Destinies (though through many Difficulties, by which they only endear their Blessings) to make us at last happy, they had never permitted us those happy Minutes we now enjoy. 'Tis a Maxim among the blindest Heathens, and taught by Christians too in their Schools, that their Fate, or our Pro∣vidence, never order'd any thing in vain. Those Stars that we see there twinkling above us, are not only Witnesses, and the only too, of our unfeigned Loves; but the Archives and Records, where the future Events of it, and our Fate is writ. You I invoke, (you fixed ones, I mean) whether our Destinies be not as unmovable as your
selves; therefore do not, dearest La∣dy, distract your self with dreadful Apprehensions from those Bugbear Dreams that terrify, or hug your self with those that flatter: They are only the imaginary visionary Excur∣sions of licentious Thoughts when all Sense and Reason is lockt up. And those fantastick Seers of old, that fondly fancied they saw such Visions in their Dreams, the wiser Criticks in our latter Age, have expounded it, That they only dreamt they saw such Visions: Those and the Oracles ceas∣ed long since together, and we have had no Revelations since those of St. John. The Isle of Old Albion (thanks be the Stars) lies far off from that of Patmos; and as for Conjuring∣books, they are only believ'd by Block∣heads in a Country Fair, where the Devil holds the Candle, while the Fools throw the Dice.—And be assured, That the Iron Book of Fate is not so ea∣sily turn'd over as those foolish ones of Fortune; and by the former 'tis de∣creed,
That you, Madam, must be mine, and that Armadorus is reserv'd for no¦body but Vincentina. The young Lady that was a little dejected with silly apprehensions, lik'd these comfortable Consolations very well; but being Religiously Educated by the Godly Mother, and so vertuously bred, thought the discourse a little loosely lay'd out upon so Sacred a Sub∣ject as Providence; but then she con∣sidered the Young Gallant again as a Soldier, and unconfin'd by those nar∣row notions of Mystical Divines, (whose business is only to be Polemical in Disputes, (that is) a Combat of words) while Military Men whose Salvations generally lye with them in their Hands or their Heels, never trouble themselves with Metaphysicks, or any Abstracts but those from good Liquors; and whose best Divinity, next to a Mistress, is alway found in a Bot∣tle or a Glass of brisk Wine; besides the notions of Irreversible Fate and Eternal Decree, as they sounded well
in her Ears since that secured her hap∣piness; so it did not come so strangely from a Soldier of Fortune; for Prede∣stination, tho' some malicious and Po∣pish Arminians may make it a Mahome∣tan Principle, will make a Christian Fight like a Turk, and is the most ser∣viceable Doctrine in any Camp or Engagement; and glad was the Young Lady she could plead unavoidable ne∣cessity for Inevitable Matrimony. This she knew would make the Pious Mo∣ther more cautious how she oppos'd Destiny, or her being Predestinated for her dear Armadorus. These Rovings, and Rallying dis∣courses, while time and the Night lay upon their Hands, helpt them on to pass both away, intermixing with those more serious and sullen ob∣servations, some pleasant Sallies of Love and Amour: But Drusilla com∣ing up from the House-side, to inform them that she heard the Cocks begin to clap their Wings, and were just going to Crow, they thought it time
to fall to their business; looking up too to the Skies, and perceiving a Dawning Azure to break out from behind the Sable Curtain of the Night, which was just a drawing, and which hasted them to these necessary Re∣solves, 1. That their meetings should be more frequent. 2. That Vicentina should without the Old Countess's leave now come again to her City-Mansion: and so Sealing their agree∣ment with a Kiss more soster than Wax, soon parted, the one to his dark Ramble,—And the other to her dainty Bed. And a dark Ramble indeed did it prove to the distressed stranger: For in∣stead of mounting his Pegasus at his re∣turn as easily as when he first set out, he found the wanton Beast had broke his Bridle, and took his. Airy flight o're Hedges and Ditches; these were great rubs in a Stranger's way in a strange Country; Sed quid non Cogit Amor; after he must, through Wind and Weather, Wet and Rain; and tho'
Love is so kindly describ'd by flatter∣ing Poets, to carry his Torch and Flambeaux about him, it favour'd him here no more than an Ignis Fatuus; for like a Will with a Whisp it led him only through Bogs and Ditches; and had the poor Helvitian been put in this distressed condition (even in his own Country) it had infallibly cost him his Neck over some horrid Precipices of their Mountain∣ous Alps; but Fate had reserv'd him, as he Prophesied before, for better Fortune; and to have more soft and easy falls into the Marriage-Bed, and the longing-Arms of his admired Mistress; for though the day was not dawn'd enough when he fell into this distress, to give him a distant prospect of his strayed Beast; yet the Sky clearing by that approaching Light, which the rising Sun drove before him upon their Horison from the adjacent Hemisphere, gave the stragling Hel∣vetian the happiness to see his Palfrey sweetly grazing in a fat Pasture
some few Fields off: These were sad disasters Love led him into; but he had done much formerly for Honour, and now would do more for Love; the Hedges he was to pass, were well lin'd, not with Musketeers, but Pike-men, thick Briars and Thorns; but through these he brake with a Resolution, that shew'd that those that dare venture their Lives, will never value their finest Cloaths, nor the fairest Skin; which had the relent∣ing Vicentina known to have suffer'd the least Scratch, it would have given her a deeper wound. But Heroes never value light hurts! Glad he was that the Man had got his Mare or Horse again; which bestriding with a thundring Rebuke, and girding him with a Revengeful Spur, sprang furi∣ously over the first Mound or Fence into the Neighbouring Highway, where being utterly unacquainted with the Roads, erroneously rid the direct contrary; and was almost come again to the Gate of that Enchanted Castle
that detain'd his distressed Damosel; loath he was to be discover'd to have been thereabouts, and to fall into the Hands of any of the Guards or Yeomanry of the Countess-Dowager, who by this time were stragling out to their several Posts and Stations; but by good Fortune ere he came within their Ken, an honest Country Peasant, unknowing as well as uncapable to dive into Love-Intrigues, had innocent∣ly as well as civilly put the stragling stranger in the right way, which brought him a little out of the per∣plexed Labyrinth of his Country affairs, to ruminate a little on them in the City with more Repose. It was the Young Countess's sole concern now, how to come up to the Capital City of that Province, to concert Matters according to agree∣ment with her Dear Armadorus: To come up with the Mother's Privity, lookt like an Insuperable difficulty; and to steal away clandestinely, would raise in her the greater Jealou∣sy;
so that this was a task that re∣quir'd a serious Consultation between Drusilla and her self; but so pregnant is the Wit of Woman, that it is sel∣dom at a loss for Contrivances: Her faithful Drusilla, that never fail'd her, had found out this Expedent; To propose to the Lady-mother Her rea∣diness to Embrace those Proposals made her by the Young Signior Ricco (a Person for whom the Old Coun∣tess had a great deal of Inclination, both for his Personal qualities as well as his Wealth and Estate); And that it was necessary to bring Matters sooner to a Conclusion, that the Young Lady should reside some time in the City, where the Young Gen∣tleman was arriv'd, till all things were settl'd to both their Satisfaction, and ready for Consummation; this Pro∣ject of Drusilla's being well laid, was lik'd as well by Vicentina; and so both dressing it up in the best manner they could, offer'd it to the consideration of the Countess-Dowager: The good
Old Lady was ready to melt into Tears at this dutiful compliance of her dear Daughter; Prophesied of nothing but Showers of Blessings, the Dew of Heaven to descend up∣on her Head; and so gave her her own Benediction into the bargain, and began to Expound in a long Para∣graph upon the Fifth Command∣ment. The result of it was, That the Young Countess was to be Con∣ducted the next Morning in her Coach, well attended, to the City, to reside there in a fair Mansion-House, the residence formerly of the Old Countess of Albania, and to what the Young Countess after the Mother's decease was Heir apparent. Vicentina could hardly Sleep that Night, you may imagine, for ruminating on the Blessed arrival of the next Morning. All her Dreams (if she had time to slumber into any) were all of hap∣py Lovers here above, and the blest abodes, and Elysian shades below:
The next rising Sun, which could not prevent her from being up first, found her drest and apparell'd for her Jour∣ney; and with his kind Beams salu∣ted her to make it look more auspi∣cious; which (after a little warm Collations of Caudles and Sack-posset, which the Old Countess could excel∣lently well prepare) she soon under∣took, parting from her tender Mo∣ther with an Heavy Countenance, and as light an Heart, letting her know as her last words at departure, (which put the Lady-Dowager into a joyful fit of Tears and Extasy) that she hop'd soon to see her self up to their City-habitation, to see her joyn'd in that Holy Matrimony she intended for her; and so left the good Old Lady in the Arms of her Maids, ready to melt away for Joy. It is a Latin Aphorism well known and receiv'd, That he that knows not to Dissemble, knows as little how to Rule; and this Maxim holds as good in Lovers most Ʋniversal Empire, where
that artful Disimulation subverts suf∣ficiently the doting Project of the Salick Law; And Women, Women only truly know how to Reign. The deceiv'd Lady-Dowager being so dexte∣rously manag'd, it was now the Young One's task, with her Trusty Drusilla, how to carry the Knife between the Apple and Paring, in so publick a Town where every bodies Eyes were upon her; and how she should carry her self to her Mother's Favourite, Signior Ricco, without disgusting Ar∣madorus, her Dearest Intimado; and this the Cunning Vicentina, with her Crafty Drusilla, did also most effe∣ctually accomplish: For receiving the former with much Civility and Respects, tho with more Coldness and Indifferency, his Visits were more publickly admitted, so that he might pass for the only Person from whom she admitted Addresses of that kind, that might be call'd Courtship; while Armadorus's Entertainments were more privately, more kindly
receiv'd, with a sort of warmth of Affection that sufficiently assur'd him he had no great reason to fear the most Potent and Richest Rival. When in Conversation with those of her own Sex, she was wont to be suddenly seiz'd with thoughtful Sullenness, and so with the usual raillery taxt with Love by her merry Companions, to be sure she would return some negli∣gent or contemptuous Answer to any Interrogatories, or pleasant Queries, put her about her Hero, the Helve∣tian; That Je ne scai quoy; that, What do ye call him? The Outlandish-man, and the like; and then turn her whole Rhetorick into Praises and Panegyricks upon the Accomplishments and Qua∣lifications of Signior Ricco; but her Armadorus at the next Encounter was to know how cunningly her Tongue had given her Heart the lye; nay, so well had she order'd her Affairs, that while she was entertaining in one Room her Mother's Favourite, she would place her own in the next, and
make him privy to all that past. This Ambidextrous Dealing (which no∣thing but the fairness of the Sex can excuse from foul play) did she conti∣nue for some considerable time, till the Countess-Dowager, whether out of distrustful Jealousy, or affectionate De∣sire to see her hopeful Daughter, sent for her again into the Country, with a Resolution, as 'twas thought, there to compleat what she suppos'd had been so long in Agitation, her Daugh∣ter's Marriage with the Gentleman she had design'd for her, and whom her Daughter seem'd to have chosen for her self at her parting. This mes∣sage made the Young Lovers relapse a∣gain into their former misfortunes, and resolve to dally no longer with their Love, but to crown all their Hopes and Tears with Fruition and Enjoy∣ment; and so having that Evening setled their Correspondency, which was to be conveyed to one another by the Young Lad of the Lady Dowagers, who brought that sweet Bllet-doux to
Armadorus when he first set out to make his Visit; the lovely Vicentina return'd the next Morning to the Old Countess, and her Country Confine∣ment; in which Melancholly Retreat she could not live long, and there∣fore began to think how to bring things to a Conclusion. The Old La∣dy's fits of Jealousies and Fears began to return, and the Reverend Priest was again set over her for a Guide and Instructor, which made him al∣most her constant Companion. The Lady Vicentina did not like these Long-Robe-men, tho for the most part they have many good Qualities to recom∣mend them to Ladies, such as the In∣nocency of their Lives and Conver∣sations; the Severities and Mortifica∣tions they suffer by their hard Labours; and Signior Castrado being in a Spiri∣tual Sense an Eunuch, could never be suppos'd to make use of any Weapon that was Carnal; but whatsoever slips and backslidings Saints or Sanctified Men may fall into, the Young La∣dies
Virtue was able to stand the test, and her Faith was engaged; and so finding her self hard prest in her Amours, she was fully resolv'd upon Matrimony; and according to what was concerted with Armadorus at their parting, writes him these Important Lines, and sends them by the Little Mercury, the young Livery-Lad, whom from a Foot-boy they advanc'd to be the Post-boy. Dearest Armadorus, 'TIS time, after all the Obstacles we have met with in our Inno∣cent Loves, to consummate them in that Holy State of Matrimony to which we we have so long courted each other, and in which our last Resolves at our parting did seem to end; but my Mothers Vigi∣lancy is such, that she has set again over me that Industrious Priest, Signior Castrado, who is as watchful over me, as any Pastor over his Flock, that would not suffer one Sheep to go astray: There∣fore my design is to remove further Jea∣lousy,
and to crave my Lady Mothers leave to go to a little Country-Seat of my own, that lies toward the Remotest Part of the Isle toward the South-West; and do you at the same time give out, that you are gone a Journey toward the North-East; and moving by these two contrary Points, my Jealous Mother may conceive we can never come together: My setting forth will be about the 15th Instant, and you know how soon, and which way to follow; my Spiritual Guide, I am afraid, will make but a weak Guardian, should you overtake us. If you write any An∣swer, subscribe no Name, lest it fall into my Mothers hand; and have always an assurance of the Faith and Affecti∣on of Your Vicentina. Armadorus upon the receipt of this (you may be sure) was ready to fol∣low the Instructions that were sent, when they were such easy Orders to
obey; not those that he was wont to receive, to Attack an Enemy in the Trenches, to march against the Mouth of a Cannon, or to Storm a Castle; but only the easy Commands from a Mistress, to commit Matrimony, to enter the Fort he had already won; and therefore presently sate down like a Champion, and writ his fair Challen∣ger this Heroick Answer. Most Adored Mistress, HAD your Commands been the most difficult Exploit that ever Mortal was engaged in; Had you ordered me to have singly attack'd an Army, or engag'd an whole Fleet in a Cock-Boat; I could have gone through all that Fire and Water to have served you, tho I had been sure of being sacrificed for your sake. For, alas, what is one single Life, tho laid down at the Feet of so Meritorious a Lady that deserves to have a thousand sacrificed to her Vertues, her Excellen∣cies, and Perfections? But when your Orders are only, that I must dye no other
Death but in your Arms; the only dan∣ger is, lest I dye with transport before I come to those dear Embraces; do not in the least doubt, Madam, of my readiness to attend your Person according to Di∣rections; and for that Eastern Expedi∣tion, 'tis known here already, that I am about to undertake it; my Baggage, Equi∣page, Personage, all ready to part, but with this Consolation (Dearest Vi∣centina) that 'tis only the better to at∣tend your Person, for which I am always ready to part with my Life, and for the sake of which I am ready to rescue you even from the Hands of all your Mo∣thers Guards, and pull you out of the Arms of all the Carlo's, Ricco's, Ca∣strato's, or Castruccio's, that can en∣compass you: And so farewell most ado∣red Mistress, till we meet for ever, and inseparably. Isca Danmonio∣rum 6. Kalender. Julii. Yours, X.
This Cannonading Language and Bombardous Style, tho it might come agreeable enough from a Souldier that is supposed to Thunder, especi∣ally when Lightning, or his bright Mistress is before his eyes; Yet this was not Armadorus's way of writing or Discourse; which was always soft and sweet, easy and good-humour'd, and of a clean contrary Air; but here was the Bombast wisely affected by him, for he considered the caution his Lady had given him, lest the Answer from him should by misfor∣tune fall into her Mothers hand; this he thought would spoil the Con∣summating Journey, upon which they were ready to set out; so that if the Old Lady should by mishap meet with this, Vicentina's Wit and Inven∣tion would soon put it off for a Banter; and 'twas well for both that it was so managed; for the Countess-Dow∣ager finding the Lad wanting, had watch'd his return, and on his first unlighting took him into her Custody,
and carried him into a private Room; where she had laid up for him an In∣strument of Correction, and threat∣ning also to lay it on severely, if he did not Confess his business, and where he had been; and so with the Terror of it extorted from the Boy, that he had both carried and brought back a Letter, the first given him by Drusilla, and the last directed to Madam Vicentina. You may be sure the Old Countess took care to possess her self of it; and to send immediately to her Daughter Vicentina for the clearing this affair, she had opened the Letter, and read it over and over; and being of a pregnant Apprehension, she thought this Rant and Rhodomontado not so agreeable with the Language of Arma∣dorus, whom she had most Reason to distrust; but seeing her Daughter coming, she composed her Counte∣nance, and confined her Thoughts; delivering the Letter, with these words to—Vicentina.
Most unfortunate Child! must my Heart never be at rest for you? must I be always thus Tormented, Alarmed, Afflicted, with new matters for fear and Jealousy? See here a new set of Addresses, so impudently offer'd you, as if you were going to Church to be Instantly Married: This must come from your old Suitor Arma∣dorus, that I thought had been long since lay'd aside; or else some New Hectoring Spark, that has hopes of carrying you by Blusterings and Bra∣vadoes; yet his Letter seems to Answer one of yours that went be∣fore; and I have brought the Boy to Confess that Drusilla delivered him a Paper, Sealed and Directed to the Gentleman that delivered him this. The Young Countess, tho' a little startled at the Adventure; yet upon perusal of the Letter, soon saw she had room enough left to evade: And boldly told her Mother that it was nothing but a meer piece of Banter and Roguery: That the Letter Drusilla
had sent by the Boy, was about common business to a Tradesman; and that her Maid was ready to vouch the same to the Boy's Face, which accordingly being called, Drusilla did (as well she might); for Armadorus's Letter her Mistress left with her to send, she had enclosed in that to a Friendly Citizen to be Communicated as directed; and that which the Boy Received, was from a strange hand, and person that he could only say was a Gentleman by his looks and behavi∣our: so the unlucky Lad was left at stake; and being too young to make discoveries, could not unriddle the Plot he was like to suffer for; for the Old Lady a little better pleased with her Daughter upon the presumption that she had been banter'd and abus'd, turned all her Resentment upon the Innocent Lad, for Receiving of Let∣ters from unknown Gentlemen for his Young Mistress; and that he might the better remember his fault for the future, exercised the Rod
she had at hand prepared for him, with a suitable severity; whilst the Unconscionable Craftiness of Vicentina that was present, made her impor∣tune her Mother, that for her sake too, she would give him a little more liberal Chastisement; tho' at the same time she stopt his mouth and crying, with a piece of Gold, that he might Confess no further; but she had Craftily brought her Affairs now to a near Conclusion, and so thought she might have no more occasion for little Mercurys and Emissarys. The time was now Approaching that was fix'd for her Western Journey; for which she had obtained leave of her Lady Mother, but with this limited Condition, that it must be in the Company and Custody of Signior Castrado, the Old Countesses Con∣fident and Confessor: Tho' the Young Lady as little lik'd this Black-Guard, as she was much Enamour'd of the Red-Coat: Yet Cedunt Arma
togae, that is to say, The Pulpit-Drum, strikes Souldiers Dumb. Yet was she forc'd to give way to it, and with a submissive Courtesy to thank her Mother for taking care she should be so well attended; and accordingly on the appointed day, with Drusilla her faithful Confident, and the for∣ward Priest her Mothers special Fa∣vourite, with a Man-Servant, set for∣ward on this Sanctisied Expedition, which though it seemed outwardly only a visiting one of her Patrimo∣nial Estates, and the supervising her Affairs, yet ended at last in the Ce∣remonies of the Church, and the happy State of Holy Matrimony; as by the sequel you'l soon see. While they were thus recreating themselves on the Road, she being as merry as the Father-Confessor was musing and reserv'd; (for Priests desire to seem Contemplative, to pass the better for Scholastick) the Young Lady trumpt up upon Singnior Ca∣strado a pleasant sort of a Question, but
what quickly raised his Spleen, (for Scholars from their Sedentary and Studious Lives, are apt to be very Hypochondraical) But what, says the merry Vicentina, what should we do (Reverend Doctor), should my fine Spark, the brisk Helvetian, that Swiss that you used so to swagger at, now follow and overtake us? This put the Seraphick Clergy-man out of his moody dumps, into a Military posture of Defence; for he verily be∣lieved the Enemy to be afar off; And with a Magisterial look and style, let her Ladiship know, that such suggestions savoured somewhat of some Love and Affection that she still retain'd for him: But whatever should happen, he was resolved to discharge his Duty to her Mother, and execute to the uttermost that trust she had reposed in him: And that if the Helvetian should have laid any design of surprizing them, he would to the uttermost resist him, Vi & Armis, raise the Posse Comitatus; and
to let her know that the Church could be Militant, he himself would hand to hand attack the Helvetian; and show her such proofs of his Prowess and Manhood, that she should soon see that the Switzers were not the only Fighting-Men in the World, whatever noise they might seem to make in it. Vicentina seeing her Guide and Guardian in such a formidable Phy∣siognomy, and breathing nothing but War and Defiance, began to divert their Discourse to subjects less pro∣voking, and more agreeable; though at the same time she could not but smile at the Heroick Valour of her Fighting Divine, which she fancied a Fit that would hold no longer than the Foe was at a distance, and out of sight; and so they jogg'd on till they came to their Inn, and Evening-Quarters, where no sooner were they sate down to refresh them∣selves, but enters the brisk and airy Armadorus, with a Port and Meen
as pleasing to his Vicentina, as it was terrifying to the Canonical Courage of her Guardian Divine, that but just before had thunder'd out such defiance; but now his heart failed him, and was got below his Girdle; and tho the Courteous Arma∣dorus saluted him kindly, he was ready to piss in his Boots, which he did not stay to pull off, but like the Night-Bird that had seized some prey which she dropt at the sight of the Nobler Hawk, and makes hast away; so was the flight of this Renowned and most Reverend Hero; Post he rid, but backward, leaving his comely Charge at the mercy of that Friendly Foe, that certainly never came to do her much hurt; and the Out-guards being thus fled, or defeated, the Castle was ready for Capitulation; and the Articles of surrender being soon agreed on, they were solemnly seal'd and ratified the next Morning, in the adjacent Parish-Church; and the Vi∣ctorious Helvetian, to the Crowning
of all his Conquests, took possession of the Fortress he had Besieged so long, that very Night. In short, the Gallant Armadorus, and the Comely Vicentina were Wed∣ded, and Bedded, and (as they thought) to their Eternal Content and Happi∣ness: The joys they conceiv'd, to find themselves approaching those mutual Embraces that sweet Hymen has al∣way in store for Innocent Lovers in their Marriage-Bed, did almost an∣ticipate those enjoyments they were to find in it. The Vertuous Vicentina, unknowing of those joys she was so sensibly to feel, trembled at the ap∣proach of the Nuptial-Bed, with a sort of eager Fear, that seemed to edge her forward, while still afraid; some∣what she knew was to be done, that look'd like dying; and the most plea∣sant Death will always carry some terror with it to a tender Maid; and though one Foot was enter'd the Lists, the other made a stand, to consider with her self whether she was to dye
indeed; for her Ingenuity had led her often to read the best Histories of Ro∣mance; where those Immortal Plea∣sures are so feelingly Recorded, that she could not but be sensibly touch'd at what she was about to do: she had seen there how their eager lan∣guishments were described to the Life, their Eyes lifted up, as if they were ready to be closed; their labouring Breasts, and their panting Breath, as on the point to expire: these were Terrors enough to have pall'd the Courage of any Amazon, or the Stoutest of the Female Sex, much more the Young Countess's that had been so carefully Educated, as to know none of these things, but only by Reading and Contemplation: There was no dispute here between Honour and Love, that made once the One Boot to go on, and the other off; but Love here, and Honour both, agreed to pull off both Stockings; and she yielding at last to the Impor∣tunities and Encouragements of those
about her; and considering also, tho she was soon to Dye, that there was as great hopes of as sudden a Resur∣rection, she enter'd at last the lists boldly, looking about for that Gallant Man, by whose Victorious Sword she was but now so much afraid to fall. On the other hand the Noble Ar∣madorus had no such sensible distur∣bance, and troublesom Emotions; he had made many a Campaign, and star'd all sorts of Deaths in the Face; all that moved him, was Transport; and all that troubled him, was Delay; for no sooner did he hear that his Fair Foe expected him, and was ready to give him Battel, or sustain his shock and Charge, but he immediately March'd to the Field with his wonted Bravery, only worthy of the Noble Armadorus; and both Combatants being undrest, to show they had neither false Armor on, but were to Fight it out fairly up∣on pure Flesh and Blood; and this being a sort of Duel, best to be decided in the dark; The Discourse is best closed
with the putting out the Lights, and the drawing of the Curtain. Modesty here obliges us to make a break,—and leave the defects of these fragments, to be supplied by those Lovers of either Sex, that have been so engaged, or gathered an Idea of it from the Learned Works of Petronius, and Cleopatra. Thus these Gallant Lovers were at last engaged, and past the tedious Night with greater toyle; but as some are said to make a toyle of a pleasure, (the re∣verse of the Aphorism here was truly verified, and) this might be called the Pleasure of a toyle. The Morning-Sun saluted them both, lock'd in each others Arms, and made them look like Duel∣lists after closing, strugling on the ground for Victory. The lovely Coun∣tess had a new lustre added to her Na∣tural Complexion from the warmth of the Engagement; and the brisk Hel∣vetian was more ruddy with the heat of the Combat; and under such a doubtful Victory, they seemed both to
blush, for being both so foiled; but with the Sun they rose from their Beds, to recruit and refresh themselves by the beams of it, as if they were to re∣new the Fight at another meeting with greater Vigour: And tho the Bridal-Solemnity, from the homeliness of a Country place, did not set forth suffi∣ciently the Gallantry of such Noble Personages; yet did their Presence and Meen make as gallant a show, that was able even to turn a Cottage into a Court; Consorts of Musick indeed they wanted, Songs and Epithalami∣ums, Balls and Dances; but tho the Country-Crowders play'd, and Selin∣ger's Round went about; this look'd more like a Whitehall-Wedding, than a Winchester, or Westminster one; for the Bride and Bridegroom, like a King and Queen, made all the figure. The honest Parish-Priest that assisted at the Ceremonies of the Church, was pre∣sent also to those of the Nuptial Bed: and look'd as big as a Bishop, after the Marrying of a Countess, and a Couple
of such transcendent Quality; and Mistress Abigail, now the Lady Vicaress, was the only person that could pre∣sume the next Morning to send the Sack-Posset: but while this small Caudle is tiffing with the Parson and his Wife the best of the Parish; it will be time to relate what became of the Guardian Priest, that fled for the same; and left all his Goods and Chattels to him that is now Lord of the Man∣nour. Neither Vicentina's Invitation, nor Armadorus's Civil Deportment to him (as we told you) could retrieve his Abdicated Courage; but he fled like a Wolf when the bleating Lamb is taken from between his Jaws: sor certain it is, that the Fair Shepherdess Vicentina, took only Armadorus for her true Shep∣herd, whatever this other Pastor might appear, or pretend to; and never was purer Love ever known in Arcadia; but as Isgrim, when the prey is gone, will oft look back and Grin for the Pur∣chase he had lost, and for fear of the
Pursuer; so did this Reverend Rhodo∣montado, when routed only with the fight of the Enemy, make haste a∣way with houlings as he went, ma∣king his plaints to the regardless Ru∣sticks, and unrelenting Stones; never Stopping till he came to a Water, over which he was to Ferry, which yet could put no Stop to his furious flight or Panick Fear. For no sooner was he got into the Boat, and putting off to the other Bank, but he charg'd the Ferry men, whatever they did, to let no spark in a Red, or Blue Coat, or any Coat, but a Black Coat, and that they were sure was no Souldier or Officer, to pass the Ferry, till they might think that he was past being overtaken (Love has Wings, and so has fear); for with that he flies as fast from his Andromede, as swift as Perseus did to her deli∣verance; tho' I think his Excellencies Palfrey did not put in for a Pegasus too: I am sure the lovely Armadorus was with them lookt upon as the
Monster; and indeed by this time I must confess he had devour'd and quite eaten up the Maid; tho' I think the Woman remain'd as sound as a Bell, which is not presently cras'd by the first Peal of the Clapper; and to see such a Venus ty'd to a Rock, 'twould make a Mars to Foam and tempt him too, to come out of the Sea, as well as the Goddess. But by this time we may suppose, the Champion-Chaplain arriv'd; and Alarming the Castle of Ogliano, the Old Countess was she that was most concern'd, and seeing her Chaplain enter with such haste in his Heels, and disorder in his Face, and no Guard, no Lady; was ready to fall down in fits before her Domestick Divine could deliver the woful tidings of their sad Misfortune; which assoon as the Reverend Guardian had got breath enough to impart, and which the Countess had not patience enough to hear out; for as he was breathless almost, and exclaming, The Switze,
Madam; The Swiss, The Helvetian! the Old Lady took him up; and what? Him have you left with my Daugh∣ter? O Coward! O Perfidious! Out from my sight, return to your Post, take my Guards; raise the Posse, and bring me Vicentina again, or never more expect to see my Face. Signior Castrado did not expect this sort of Re∣ception; but rather Thanks for his quick and speedy Information; and for going back to engage with Switzer, he thought it might prove harder service then the cutting down of a Sunday-Pudding; but since his Pa∣troness had imposed this severe pe∣nance upon him, he, to merit again her favour assur'd her, he would ven∣ture his Life and Fortune to redeem the Lady; and so rid back like Orlando Furioso to find out the fair Angelica. And what did a little encourage him with a resolution to look after her, was, That returning by the same Ferry he had so fearfully past over; the Water-men assur'd him upon his
Importunate Enquiry, that no such Soldier-like-man had pursu'd him; which put a little more mettle into the Moody-man, and made him think the Foe not so fearful and formidable; and so boldly approaches the Man∣sion-House where he had left the Lady, and Imperiously delivers to the Courteous Armadorus this Lordly Mes∣sage. Sir, My Commands are, (and what I must see executed) from the noble La∣dy, and incomparable Paragon, the La∣dy-Dowager, Countess of Albania, my most honoured and admired Patroness, and the present Consort to the Noble Lord of Ogliano, That you deliver to my Hands the Young Countess of Albania, the Lady Vicentina by name, to be by me re-convey'd to the Castle of Ogliano aforesaid, or else to suffer your self to be proceeded against with a Noli prosequi, Soire facias, Capias ut legatum, Ne exeas Regnum; or else, Sir, we shall attack you with a Writ de Homine vel Virgine replegi and; and
this, Sir, you are to do without any Deliberation, Procrastination, Exa∣mination, Determination, or Defal∣cation whatsoever. The Young Armadorus, tho' a Scho∣lar bred, yet being not so perfect in the Country-Stile, did not so well un∣derstand this barbarous banter, but smiling at the furious Phyz of the incensed Bravado, mildly askt, What the meaning was of all this Thun∣dring Dialect? and being inform'd that it was an Order he brought from the Countess-Dowager, to deliver her Daughter to be by him brought back to her Mother,—With a Courteous smile replied,—He was sorry that her Mothers Chaplain did with such precipitous haste de∣sert them, having not in the least dealt uncivilly with him; and design'd him no other hurt but a piece of Gold or so, and a pair of Fring'd Gloves by the by, for a cast of his Ofice; but if she  with him now, he was oblig'd to nd her Person when
she went, both sor the affection that he bore the young Lady, and the filial Duty he was always ready to show the Old Countess, whose Blessing he was com∣ing to ask with the Lady Vicentina, his dear Spouse, assoon as possible; and so taking her by the Hand, they saluted each other in confirmation of all that was said. But as hot as the High-Priest was before, yet this soft and civil answer put him all into a cold Sweat: He found the business done and past remedy; Gold and Gloves gone too; and to bring him out of his brown study, they gave the musing or amus'd Gentleman, a Cup of the Country-Caudle that was yet left warm after Breakfast; and with that the astonish'd Vicar began to reco∣ver; and since all was past Redress, to be pretty good Company; promi∣sing what mediation lay in his power, he would make use of for moderating, the Old Countess's Resentment, and restore them to her favour; Thus ended the great contest between the
Lover, the Lady, and the Gnardian; and having recreated themselves some few days with what Diversions the Countrey thereabouts could afford them, they began to bethink them∣selves how to make their Peace at home; which they did not so much doubt of compassing, since things that are irretrieveable, tho' never so much oppos'd, are commonly com∣pli'd withal when past remedy; and therefore they began to think of strengthning their Interest by Appli∣cations from all sides; and so courte∣ously thanked the Reverend Signior Castrado, for his kind Overture; assuring him, that if he would please at his re∣turn to convey with him a Line from himself, and his Lady, to the Lady-Mother, they had that confidence in him, that they could intrust him with an affair of that nature; and so accordingly both prepar'd their seve∣ral Epistles.
The Countess Vicentina, to the Coun∣tess-Dowager of Albania. Honoured Madam, SInce the Powers above direct all our Destinies below, and this an acknow∣ledg'd Principle by all ages, long before we came to profess our Christianity; and was then own'd and profest by the Apostles and Christians themselves, in their Epistles to those Romans and Hea∣thens they had converted; I have won∣der'd how it comes to pass that so many have set up such Novel Opinions in these latter days, That we weak Worms are free Agents, and have a free will to do what we please; whereas, dear Mother, you know what great inclinations I alway had to follow your good Counsel: How I wean'd my self from wicked Company to keep me from falling into any Snare: Nay, How I abstain'd from the Conver∣sation and Society of the most admired Armadorus; a Person whom now I can∣not but confess I ever dearly loved: And to avoid his Courtships and Applications,
came home in obedience to your I adi∣ship's Commands; but such are the over-ruling Powers above, and so do they dispose of things below, Armado∣rus overtook me in this Journey, and being destin'd to marry me, did accord∣ingly do it, it was in vain for me, to resist the Decrees of Heaven; and the Crime I have Committed is no more than what Heaven obliges you to Pardon; and that therefore will shower down its bles∣sings the more upon you, when you do not deny your blessing to Your most dutiful Daughter, Vicentina. The Young Countess was never so much affected with a Canting Stile; as to love to write Letters in it; but knowing her Mother given that way; much gifted, and a great Anti-Armi∣nian; she methodiz'd the matter so, to make it more taking; but Armodorus was more Laconick, and like a Gene∣ral, in a sort of Epistolary Oration, accosts her thus:
To the Countess-Dowager of Albania. Madam, IT has been my fortune to espouse the Lady I lov'd above all in the World, and that is your Daughter, the Darling of my Soul, the Delight of my Heart; she has been pleased to accept of me for her Husband, and I hope for that Ho∣nour you'll receive me for your Son; and tho I am still a Stranger, you may, Ma∣dam, not repent of the Alliance upon a further Acquaintance; my Affection for your Daughter may merit some of yours for me: If you deny us both your Blessing, it will only make your self uneasy, and us unhappy. Armadorus. The Reverend Doctor that had un∣dertook a task now of quite another nature than what he came about, began to be of a better Temper too; and taking his leave of the young Mar∣ried Couple, promised them to deliver
their Letters, and use his Mediation for their being received into favour; which to give him his due, according∣ly he did, discharging himself in both Trusts like an honest Man that made a Conscience of his ways. When he was return'd, and had encounter'd the Countess, you may be sure the first Question was with a great deal of eagerness; And where's my Daugh∣ter? Signior Castrado as calmly and cunningly reply'd, Madam, she is coming to wait upon your Ladiship, and with her the young Armadorus; For to tell you the truth, Madam, my Arrival was too late to hinder what now, nor then could be helpt, and that is, their Marriage; they are Man and Wife: With that he paus'd a little, to give some vent to the Old Lady's Passion, which he saw rising in her Breasts.—And is my Daughter then undone for ever,—for ever ruined? Is all my Motherly care that cultivated her tender Years, come to this? All my Godly Education, Exhortation,
Conversation, come to this Tergiver∣sation, Abdication, Reculcitration, and downright Reprobation? O Vicentina, falfe Girl, perfidious Creature! never more expect to see my Face.—But An∣ger that had storm'd her breasts, being a little abated, and she being a Woman of Judgment too, some more serious and Godly Considerations began to take place; and who knows, added she, but this might be ordain'd for her, Matches are made in Heaven, and 'tis in vain for us Humane Creatures, to resist what is decreed for us. O, the Soul saving Doctrine of Predestination! which the Reprobate and Ʋngodly re∣ject, but all the Elect do daily find to be a Doctrine delivered to the Saints; Poor Girl! we must submit to what is ordained for thee; and so wiping her old dry Eyes, as if they had wept,—began to look abroad. And Signior Ca∣strado took hold of this as a good Jun∣cture to deliver to her hand the two Let∣ters; Vicentina's was that she first open∣ed, and finding her Daughter so piously
begging her pardon, and using the same powerful argument, and godly motive, that made the Countess so compliant; she delivers it the Reverend her Chap∣lain to read; we must submit, said she, to what Providence hath ordained for us; and you see the poor Vicentina, as she says, was over-power'd by the Powers above.—And she writes still as if she had not abandoned all Grace, and turn'd Reprobate. And then opening that Epistle of Armadorus, after per∣usal, added, Signior Castrado, he writes much like a Gentlemen, and may be of some Consideration in his own Country, and prove a kind Husband to her here. And therefore, Signior Ca∣strado, take a Journey back again, and give them my Blessing, and let them know they may come home to the Ca∣stle of Ogliano, as soon as they think con∣venient. The Chaplain that was glad he had brought matters to that Accom∣modation in an Affair in which he had so great a share, and being of that im∣portance too, that he could say with the Poet,
—Quaeque ipse miserrime vide; Et quorum pars mgna fuit. That is to say in our Idiom, 'Tis I, that in this woful case, The Guard, and Moderator was For Dido, and her Aeneas. This kind Gentleman quickly posted away with the glad Tidings to the young married Folks, that were long∣ing for his return, and the Fruits of his Embassy; which as soon as they under∣stood, they all jollily and jocundly pre∣par'd for their Journey home; where when they were arriv'd, their Mother gave them their Blessing on their knees, tho at first with a little cold kindness, which by degrees was warm'd again into Affection. The Young Couple's Apartments were fixt, and their Bedchamber as∣sign'd them in that Green Room once her Maiden-Castle or Imprisonment, now the Nuptial Bed-room, abounding with all the Freedom and Delights that
Matrimony and the Marriage bed could afford. The Loving Pair, like two Turtles, would be alway together, and oft visit that pleasant place of Retirement at the lower end of the Garden, and there (in solitude more comfortable to them than the best Company) recount the variety of their past Adventures, the Disappointments and Successes in their Amours. And this said, Vicentina, This solitary Grove, be thou always Sacred to the God of Love; in such, our Sires, the Ancient Druids, offer'd up their dai∣ly prayers, and did not Sacrifices cease to thee Diana; to thee thou Goddess truly Chast and Virtuous, we would here erect a Monumental Temple to perpetuate the Remembrance of our faithful Hearts here first plighted: No Amarillis or Myrtillo ere did burn with purer Flames, nor readier were to offer up their Lives to save each other's Life. 'Twas thou, O sweet and shady Soli∣tude! that in my silent Slumbers didst appear, and draw before my waking
Thought (tho Senses slept) that curi∣ous Dream and Scene of painted Love; and that fantastick Interview we had beneath this most obliging Shade, was really, was pleasingly fulfill'd. But far be from us, Dearest Armadorus! those dire presages in which that Dream did make so dismal end: avert ye Fates; but that kind Heaven is already done, and those malignant Stars that swell'd with spite and venom, and ready were to dart their pointed Influence down upon our Heads, like false ones, now are fallen, fallen now, and like the Spawn of Toads or Frogs, we tread the filthy Gelly now beneath our feet. With that the Lovers bill'd, and coo'd, and kist, no Turtles e're did mate with more de∣light; when on the covert Boughs of Thickets percht, they murmur inno∣cently forth their soft and harmless Loves. And thus the Lovers liv'd, and thus they Loved, prolonging days and nights for fear that spend-thrift Time should speed too fast away, and make them
Bankrupts in the Trade of Love, who had laid in a ock for both their Lives and what they thought so much, that all could never waste, or they live long enough to spend. But ah! how vain are Human thoughts! how short falls our forecast of that which is Divine! and how doth fate enforce us to adore that Deity vile Mortals would Contemn! what to our Clouded thoughts seemed Clear, and misty Reasons darkned Cell, (tho in the brightest part of all the Brain 'tis plac'd; as 'twere Reserved for Reasons Sacred Soul; (as Sages say) a Seat and Receptacle to reside) how yet does all this glaring light Like Fatuus fires be∣fore the Rising-Sun, quite vanish, dis∣appear, when an Omniscience Divine does to the darkned Earth, in brigh∣ter Rays reveal what Man, the wisest Man, thought Heaven it self could ne∣ver bring about: How doth it laugh at all our fruitless toyl, to compass that beyond our Heaven it self; which when obtain'd, enjoyed, it turns to
Hell and Torment? What blessings oft do those wise Powers above (who in that vast Eternal NOW all past and future see) by ways unknown, un∣thought, bestow, by contradictions to our arguing Sense, by our vain Reason∣ings call'd impossible, and by dire baneful paths securely lead where happiness hangs out before our eyes, that no∣thing there but misery could see? So does it act too oft for thankless Man; that Wiser needs would seem then Mighty He that made the silly Worm. When thro' a raging tempest, wild despair, where Winds destruction soar above, while gastly Waves do for  gape below, how do laborious Wretches toil on board, bear up against kind Heavens and the Wind, to reach some dangerous Port to be un∣done; who spight of their resistance to their fate, to some far distant shore are born away, where by unthought∣of happiness at last they find their lives not only sav'd, but Fortunes made. Thus far'd it with this Amorous
Pair, whose Wits, Invention, daily thoughts and Prayers, with all the fa∣culties of Mind and Soul, were all at work by Policy, Disguise, by Plot and stratagem, and all that art and cun∣ning could invent, to compass what they call'd their happiness,—One Nights enjoymont of untasted joy—But Heaven, alas! smil'd at this humane folly; much better far, and happier had they been if only Lovers still; while midst the fullest gusts of free Fruition, Luxuri∣ous Love spent all the vital heat that fed it, and on a sudden surfeited, and di'd. Armadorus after he began to recover breath, which the Blandishments and Caresses of conjugal affection (we may suppose) had a little exhausted especially in such eager Lovers, be¦gan to consider, that as he had married a young Heiress, so it behov'd him now as her Husband to enquire into he Fortune and Estate, which she was t inherit; and upon enquiry began t perceive that by some secret Convey∣ance,
not usually so clandestinely pra∣ctised, she had been prevail'd upon, during her minority, to make over her Estate in Trust to her Mother, so that should she die childless, all her plenti∣ful Revenue would be left wholly in the disposal of the old Countess; which Armadorus did not so well ap∣prove of: And tho' he lov'd his Mistress much more than her Mony and Wealth, yet was he loth (Mony being the best commodity in his Country) to be supplanted in his Right to a Silver Mine, not so frequently found in the Mountains of Helvetia; and to lose a rich vein, at which he had been working so long; every Body knows the true Proverb which the French Tongue has so peculiarly fasten'd up∣on them; Ne point d' Argent, ne point de Suisse. No Switz's fights where no Money is. But tho' Armadorus's Soul seem'd ele∣vated even above the Altitude of his own Country, (in which by the way,
are the highest Hills) tho' he could not condescend to that meaness of Spi∣rit, so as to be sordidly Mercenary; yet his Sense directed him, there was no reason why he should be defrauded in any thing that was his real right by the Laws of Marriage, no more than to be rob'd of what was his own by Birth-right; and this put him often when alone with his Vicentina, upon as king of questions relating to her For∣tune and Estate: In which the Young Lady indeed was not so well acquain∣ted her self; the Old Countess being a Woman that well understood the World, and was resolv'd to have the management of those affairs left in∣tirely to her self: so that the Lady Vicentina could only reply to her Ar∣madorus, that she would take a time to discourse her Mother on that Subject. Many days were not elaps'd before the Old Countess gave a good occasi∣on for the entring upon such a dis∣course; for having her Daughter alone, she began to instruct and advise her,
that since she had unfortunately Marri∣ed a stranger, it would be proper to enquire into what Jointure or Mar∣riage-settlement himself or his Friends could make her, before she suffer'd the least part of her Portion to come into her Husband's Hands; that he might at any time, when in possession of what was her Fortune, cross again the Seas and the Alps too, and leave her only so much worse as he found her; that there was a Conveyance of her Estate made over to her self during her minority; and that as long as she suf∣fer'd that to stand, she could secure her self against his wasting and embezel∣ing any of it; that she must provide for her self and Children if she had any; and since she had plaid her game so ill, she was to take care that the after-game might be the better look't too, and the ast stake more wisely manag'd. These grave Dictates, and for∣mal Instructions, tho' perhaps not un∣necessarily given, would have made out little impression on Vicentina's
Heart, before the wonders of Love had satiated all her Senses; for that is a passion that surmounts the strong∣est Conviction of Reason, and Con∣science too: It makes many Fools, and as many Villains; 'Tis an infir∣mity Humane nature is subject to, to be overcome easily by what is pa∣latable and pleasing; and the not gratifying Sense, seems to most a di∣vesting themselves of Humanity; tho' indeed, 'tis the Brute only that is then put off: But Vicentina now having seen and felt the utmost efforts of that Love, she had unknowingly and so blindly admir'd, began now to open her eyes, and consider her actions, and suffer her Mothers advice and good Counsel to sink down into her Heart, and to ponder it in her understanding, and so promis'd her Mother that those Settlements made in her minority she would never revoke, but was ready rather to confirm. This was well pleasing to the Coun∣tess-Dowager, who as she coveted
to bring it about for her Daughters sake; so 'twas plainly visible it was somewhat for her own ends oo; for should the Young Lady Childless leave the World before the Old (for the Young may, as well as the Old must) the Countess Dowager then had been entirely possest of all the Patrimonial, Allodial, Feudatory, Fee∣simple and Tayl, Real and Personal, Appendant and Appurtenant, all that Civil Right, and Common Law, Codes and Pandects, Cook and Littleton could make her own: This the cunning and crafty Countess, that knew how to butter her Bread, and when the Cake was Dough, did excellently well un∣derstand; so that her good advices to her Daughter were a sort of mixt Actions, as the Moralists call them, made up with the good ingredients of Interest and Love; or in a plea∣santer smile stuft up like Black Pud∣dings, with her Daughters Blood and her own Oatmeal or Girts. Armadorus on the other hand pre∣suming
upon the fervent affection of his Dear Vicentina, which he thought as constant and true as ever splendid Sun was to the Gnomon of the Dial, did often desire her, that since so unjust a Settlement was made of her Estate du∣ring her minority, (which as it had been suggested to him, was by false Testimony of her full age, when all the while but a Minor) this he desir'd she would revoke, since so fraudulent a Conveyance; but Vicentina better instructed, and the fervency of love a little cool'd, answer'd her Inamorato as coldly; That it was impossible for her to comply with such a request; that the power was in her Mother; that she could not be undutiful to her that had done so much for her, and af∣ter she had so much disgusted her, yet had after all receiv'd her into favour. Armadorus a little surpris'd at this un∣expected indifferency, from a thing that was so dear to him as the Young Countess, his most adored Vicentina, or rather a down-right denial from her,
for whose sake he had deni'd himself every thing, his ease, repose, nay, his very livelihood and subsistence; for at her request, (when love ruled, and had its absolutely Empire in her Breast) so tender was she of his person, that she would never suffer it to be expos'd to any other Artillery but that of her Eyes; nor be encompass'd with any other Arms but those longing ones she was wont to clasp about him; so by her Im∣portunity, or Requests, that with him were Commands, did he quit Inglori∣ously all the Trophies and Triumphs, all the Victories and Conquests that Mars had in reserve to reward his Gallant Actions, ignobly thus to follow his Venus, and Enervate himself with a Woman. In short, her love got him to throw up all his Commissions, and now her neglect began to make him wish them all in his Pocket. But, cruel Avarice, and wretched Gold, to what inglorious unworthy Actions, and unnatural too, dost thou, O glittering Dirt, dispose the noblest Soul!
For thee the faithfullest Friend does stand at Bay, and stares upon thy shi∣ning tempting shew, and pauses in his full career to serve his Friend, ambi∣guous whether he had best betray him. For thee! A Father greedy to be great, to gripe and grasp at Thee! Thou Excrement lodg'd in the Bowels of the sordid Earth, will his own Son forget, his very Bowels, and sell him Slave to Dig and Delve those Mines from whence thou camest; and like those Indians, (only brave in this, that they despise thee) will Sacrifice his dearest Daughter, darling of his Soul, to some adored Monster all in Falmes, some heated glowing Moloch of a Man, to gratify some Satyr, Humane Brute, that has the name of Prince, the lust and shape of Goat; thy very Colour cost Mankind that Ʋniversal Curse: That Golden Fruit! brought all the Ages since to Brass and Iron. For thee! The dearest Brothers, the very Gemini of Love and friendship! shall for thee turn mortal foes; and they
who lay so lovingly involv'd within the self-same Womb, shall sheath their Swords within each others Bowels. For thee! whole Rivers reel in flowing Gore, and fatten'd Fields luxu∣rious are with Blood; whole King∣doms shake like some Sicilian Town that at the Foot of roaring Etna stands, which belches forth its liquid flames of less pernicious Ore, whilst Crowns and Scepters totter like their Towers, and falling in thy rapid Streams of Fire, are born away and melted down. And 'tis for Thee alone, tho' ne're so much Resin'd, Thou filth even of the finest Soul! that these two matchless Lovers, who not long before were lan∣guishing in Love, have liv'd to see their very Loves to languish, as if they now were come sor to outlive their very selves, and have their empty Carcasses survive their transmigrated Souls. Armadorus look't on her cold re∣pulse a little hard, and took it much
to heart; but for the present would press her no further in the affair; fear∣ing to discompose her whom he still tenderly lov'd; but after he had suffer'd her obstinacy (as he thought) to soft∣en by degrees, and to supple her with Lenitives, he took her aside one after∣noon into some withdrawing Room, and there with a look compos'd of Gra∣vity and Love, delivered himself in these words. My Dear, were your kindness to me what once it was, when we first fixt our Eyes upon one another, you would never have denied me the request I have so often made you; and 'tis mighty strange, that Armadorus when a stranger almost unknown to Vicen∣tina, should have had more power over her, then after she has hugg'd him in her Arms, and embraced him for her Husband! harder yet it is, my dear, to deny me a possibility of subsisting by your means, that have made me quit an honourable employment for your sake! Consider, should the sates rob
me of my Vicentina, in what condition should I be left; my Soul, my Life, indeed will be gone with you, my Love; and so I may not long survive, but linger out some years, in which I can't be truly said to Live, much less to want: but how will it please your Airy Ghost, when gliding by me in your stalking shade, to see me pensive sit and mourn my fate; whilst your Triumphant Mother proudly Reigns o're all, and domineers in all the Pala∣ces, that once my dear were yours, and should be mine. Too late perhaps it then may be, for your relenting Ghost to think to haunt your Salvage Mo∣their into humane nature; not that my case so sad, deplorable, may be, but that I may find friends tho' ne're so much a Foreigner; for this kind Isle is not a little fam'd for Friendship, Hospitality, and Love: All which I have already found; but hitherto I must consess in none, my Vicentina, more than you; yet should I be abandoned by you, (which shivers me with horror but to
think) my birth within my native Country is not so obscured; my Fa∣ther stands possest of great Commands, in Civil and in Military too; besides all what is Patrimonial-Land must be my own; And you have brought no beg∣gar to your Bed; all that I beg, is right and Common Justice; what your own Laws allow, you'l let me crave! The Custom of your Country is so kind, so truly Courteous is your Common Law, 'twill let the Hus∣band for his Life enjoy what Land was ere his Wives, by Courtesy. Loath Vicentina do I talk to you of Justice, Custom, Equity, and Law; Love was the wonted subject of our talk; and still of what we talkt we were agreed; I hate to name to Vicentina LAW, it sounds Litigious, sounds a dying Love, and with a wrangling clashing Peal of noise, to ring some parting Friend's or Lover's Kneel.—But still of this, my Love, be well assur'd, your Mother with her wiles shall ne're prevail, for of what's yours and mine I'le be possest,
and Righting of my self is Righting you. The Young Countess melting into Tears with the softness of his Speech, and disturb'd with the tendency of it to Law and Discord, had her Soul divi∣ded, and her Senses lost, between the Love she still retained for him, the Du∣ty she would seem to have for her Mo∣ther; but indeed the deepest regard that disordered her, was what she had for her self: The Old Countess having inculcated so often, that her Husband was a Man of no Fortune, and if of any Fortune, at best but a Souldier of For∣tune, with such like malicious Insinua∣tions, that made the poor Young Gen∣tlewoman confounded, distracted al∣most with variety of thought, and per∣plexity of mind, which way to manage her self in such an intricate affair, where so many different passions and affections, which like winds from se∣veral Quarters, were sporting with her floating Soul like a bubble, both filled and agitated with each blast of Air: Insomuch that these fluctuating
thoughts immediately influence those Animal Spirits to faintness (the finer and purer parts of which some Phisiologist suppose to form the think∣ing Soul, distinct from what so Ratio∣nal we call; for that we grant infused us from above, all immaterial; yet on matter works by strange Connexion su∣pernatural: But without that, we find brute Beasts to think; and as those Spi∣rits finer, purer are, so are those Ani∣mals more thoughtful, cunning, doci∣ble and wise;) And these in Women soonest are disturbed, and light emoti∣ons seem with them to move vast hea∣vy loads, which rising from below op∣press the vital Sense above, and seem to strangle, without suffocation, which Men of Art call, Fits Hysterical, and idly once fixt in the Female Womb, then in diseased spleen, more wisely now in the Minds passion, and disor∣dered Spirits: This was the Countess's afflicted Case; she heard him tenderly, attentively; but like Sabina still, that would not seem to hear, fain would
she have stopt, kept down, the rising Ball of grief, and strangled in her Breast those strugling Passions, that would rise to Choak her; but too weak alas! she was to bear up against the Tide of swelling Sorrow, or by Imre∣rial Reasons wise Command, to Rally, Rank and File her fierce disorder'd Spirits; and so with lift▪ up Eyes, and drooping Head she fainted, fell down in her Lover's Arms. Armadorus surprized at such an un∣expected Disaster, did all he could to recover her out of her fit, by chafing her hands, rubbing her Temples, and by chance having a Bottle of Salts or Spirits about him, which he applied to her Nostrils, all the while calling for help and assistance, which soon came in to him; at last she began to open one of her languishing Eyes, letting them know there was Life enough left, but only the wheels of it a little disorder'd by some sudden Emotion in the Blood and Spirits; which being composed by degrees, she soon came to her self:
And seeing both her Mother and her Armadorus, both at the same time busy about her, she recover'd her Com∣plexion a little the sooner with a blush: And hardly knew whom she should thank first, for their friendly offices, and care of her Recovery; she saluted both with Duty and Affection; and all past over as an Accidental fit, tho' what indeed might here be truly so called, A sit of the Mother; neither was this like to be the last that the manage∣ment of the Old Countess was like to bring her to; notwithstanding which the poor Armadorus was traduc'd for it, as if by his Severities, Threatnings, and even Violence offer'd, he had made her fall into that Condition. Armadorus, after several opportu∣nities he had taken to prevail with Vi∣centina, but with all the mildness ima∣ginable, but all ineffectual and vain; was forc'd at last to resolve to recover that by Law, which was denied him against Reason; and so without mo∣lesting his Dear Mistress any more in
a matter he found her so averse to, prepar'd himself for a Journey to the Capital City, the Metropolis of the Kingdom, there to Consult with the Men of the greatest Abilities in their Professions, and the knowledge of the Customs an Co mmon Usuages, the Civil and Municipal Laws of the King∣dom. His design he kept to himself, and only made his Journey occasional. But Vicentina, tho Love had once blind∣ed her, was too quick sighted now to be easily deceived; and seeing him bent to undertake this long Voyage a∣gainst her will and inclination, was very ready to mistrust the right matter and meaning of it; and so with more hasty Passion than ordinary, which was once a stranger to her tender Love, told him, she knew his design that he went about, that it was to get her Fortunes and Estates into his possession; but if he mov'd one step towards the Law, he must never more expect to see her Face.
The Young Hero, tho Love had got once the Ascendant, and somewhat E∣nervated him by the Blandishments and softnesses of his Fair Venus, Vicentina, yet he had not wholly Abandon'd Mars and his wonted Courage; but answer∣ed her now a little more roughly; That it was time for him now to look about for himself; and since she was in a Combination with her Mother for his Ruin, he was resolved to take up some Commissions again in the Army, which her Importunity had caused him to lay down; and that this was the chiefest business he went about: that he perceived her wonted Affection for him, that was once so warm, was by this time very well cooled; and that the Dangers he should be Exposed to in a Camp, might quickly rid her of an Husband, for whom she had so little Kindness and Esteem, and one that with his continual Caresses had Cour∣ted after Marriage more like a Lover, and not Governed, or Commanded her like her Lord: and indeed, Armadorus
his fondness (as 'twas generally thought) Fool'd the Young Lady into a more Refractory Obstinacy, than was Natural to her Temper and Con∣stitution; but as much Marble as she was, she melted into Tears at his talk∣ing of exposing of his Person to the ha∣zards of uncertain War. But the Countess-Dowager, that desired no∣thing more than by some obliging Ball or Bullet to be rid of her Son-in Law, persuaded her Daughter not to lay it so much to heart; that there were Men enough going in the World, and better Husbands to be had: However the piteous Vicentina was not become yet so obdurate; she wanted a little more of her Mothers Stony Heart to petrify hers; and so beseeched him ear∣nestly not to think of any such thing, and she would bear with his Absence for a while, if his occasions required it, if he would promise a return to her, and not to the Army: Armadorus, that perhaps never designed it, was easily prevailed on to promise so much; and
so for that time affairs seemed a little accommodated. He prepared for his Journey, with Reluctancy parted from his Spouse; who throwing her longing Arms about his Neck, showed also how loath she was to part with him; they sighed by consent, and their Tears mingled as they Kiss'd: They parted indeed, but pursued one another so long with their looks, till a cruel distance cut off the Communication of their Eyes. Armadorus arrived no sooner among the Dispensers of the Law those Oracles of the Courts of Justice, but you may be sure he received good encourage∣ment for the carrying on the Cause, which as yet carried somewhat of merit with it; so it had with them a promising aspect of Profit too. He came to take Counsel with a Meen that carried Gold in both Hands, and that did declare, he was not come to Starve his Cause, In forma Pauperis; and that was able to make any Nokes a Tertullus or John a Stiles a Chrysostomus: For
he Experimentally found verified a∣mong the Gentlemen of the Law, what his Country-men had always practised in their Arms. What Swiss came e're to Beat of Drum, Or, Bawling Lawyer was not Dumb, To see no Gold nor Silver Come? It is a happy thing for a good Cause, to have a good Client too, or ten to one but it miscarries; Armadorus had the good luck to make both these ends to meet, and so went on merrily with his Negotiation: and first to qualify himself with the privileges to Traffick as a Native, obtained an Act of Na∣turalization, to bring himself upon the same bottom with those that had dealt so Ʋnnaturally with him; this being compast, the Complainant Armadonus, (that indeed had very good Reason to Complain) was advised to turn humble Orator, and to move in a Court of Equity for Redress against those Perilous Women for withholding his Right; while the good Women at the
same time were Counselling to get hi, into a Spiritual Court for detaining the due: These Variances, this Cloud o Discord; that was like to raise such a dust, and on both sides a Cloud of Wit∣nesses too; was for a little while diss∣pated and dispell'd, by a sudden seisure of the poor Armandorus with a violent Sickness, so that he could not follow and dispatch his Affairs with that dili∣gence; and therefore laying aside those little resentments that contesting gene∣rally stirs up, (He being utterly Ig∣norant that the cunning Old Countes had in his Absence, engaged his Dear Spouse to declare her self his open E∣nemy, and sue for so Unnatural a Se∣paration, and cruel Divorce) while he lay Languishing on his Bed in a Feaver, which his Physitians look'd on as Malignant, occasioned (as they said) by some ill Planets that now seem'd to Influence their Loves; for the Mars and Venus had been lately in Con∣junction, they were now like to come in direct Opposition: Lumpish Satur
seemed to Lower, and Libra could not keep the Scales even between them; bold Sagitarius had shot Virgo thorough and thorough, and it approaching to∣ward the Vernal Equinox, where Aries might predominate, 'twas fit for Husbands to show themselves very kind to their Wives, for fear of the worst: That there was a great distance indeed in Trine, and many wide De∣rees of difference between the Old Countess, the Young, and Armadorus; they might meet in the House of Strife, but their Horoscope had no Room for them in the House of Life. Thus, out of Ptolomy, Haly, Cardanus, Olaus; all is Physicians, Rosacrucians, & vere depti, having severally declared their opinions, and confirm'd them from e Writings of Trismegistus, Mesue, vicenna, Averroes, Arabians, Aegyptians, hose Works and Words like the De∣ees of the Medes and Persians, was ot to be Controverted; The poor tient Armadorus that understood their Jargon no more than they did
his Helvetian, did only guess that his Condition was but bad, and the worse for that his Doctors did not understand it; and therefore as soon as their Gra∣vities was descended Decently, he dictated to his Amanuensis these few Lines for his Dearest Vicentina. Dearest Vicentina, AS nothing but Death can make a se∣paration between us; (which is in∣deed an Unavoidable Divorce) so as long as I have Life, nothing shall be more In∣separably yours: but alas! how long that will be, I know not; for I am at present in such a languishing Condition, that I can∣not continue long under that indisposi∣tion that oppresses me: A consult of Physicians I have had, who talk to me much of Stars and Constellations; but un∣derstand no more my Disease, than if they had studied nothing but Almanacks. 'Tis only you my Dear Heart that can relieve me; I have nothing in this long absence left to enjoy you in, but Thought and Con∣templation, and out of that you never are;
the great distance cannot hinder me from enjoying you in a Dream; and my restless Nights afford me only Dreaming slumbers; I long to see you, and that speedily, lest those Eyes should close that have so much delighted in the Contemplation of yours, and those other Features and Perfections of your Face. My hand is too weak to guide that Pen, that should convey to you the Dictates of my Soul; and so am forced to crave the assistance of a Secretary: But my Heart, as faint as it is, is firmly yours; and your Idea the only Cordial that sup∣ports it. Pray Dearest hasten your depar∣ture, and let no false Insinuations of an ill Mother detain you, or make the least division between your beloved self, and your most Affectionate Armadorus. The good soft humoured Gentle∣man, (as we have observed before) having not the least in him of the Rough temper of the Helvetian, had habituated himself to those Compella∣tions to his Wife, that others com∣monly
use in their Courtships to their Mistress; and by his sweetness of Ad∣dress endeavoured to continue that Affection when her Husband, which he had in Abundance, when only her Lover; but alas! all was in vain: His absence had lain him open to the As∣persions and Recriminations of an en∣raged Mother; and exposed his Lady to the frequent Assaults, and constant Importunities of the Incensed Coun∣tess. The Allodial Lands, the Patri∣monial Money, and the Young Hero's going to Law for both, lay like Lead upon her Heart, a load upon her Stomach, she could not digest it; and so it made her Spleen to rise, and to resolve to ruine him: The Young Lady also by his being out of sight, and far off, and so feeling nothing of those warm Impressions that her Dear Armadorus was wont to make upon her, was more easily prevailed upon by the Old Countess to forget those Caresses she had of late not been ac∣customed to; and so suffered her self
wholly to be governed by her Mothers Directions; and having by the Post Received the foregoing Letter, imme∣diately almost communicated it to the Lady Dowager for her advice and opinion how it should be answered; indeed she perused it by her self a little at first; and the tenderness it exprest, and the danger that Armadorus (once her Dearest) was in, did a little move her; but a sudden Fit of the Mother mov'd more strongly; and so carried away both her self and the Letter to the Lady Dowager, to Consider and Consult for an Answer. And that you may be sure the Old Lady was not long to study for. The Young Countess was the She-Scribe, while the Old seem'd a sort of Female Pharisee; the Young Lady not being quite so Obdurate, was beginning In∣nocently her Letter with the wonted Compellation of My Dear; which the Mother observing, seemed almost in∣censed at her inconsiderate Compella∣tion, and asked her whether she was
Courting of him agen; and made her blot out that tender fineness, and set down plainly Armadorus; but then be∣thinking her self agen, that such a Title signified somewhat of Friendship and Familiarity still retained, to E∣strange and Alienate her self the more from him, she made her Daughter ob∣literate that also, and at last without any more Ceremony, to Insert plainly, Sir; and to vary nothing from what she should dictate, which was as fol∣lows. Sir, YOƲ seem already to have Divorc'd your self from me while you are a∣live, so you have no need of Death to make a farther Separation; you may remember before you deserted us, when you discoursed me on the subject that has caused this sepa∣ration, I told you, that if ever you went to trouble us with your Litigiousness and Law, I would never Live with you, nor see your Face; notwithstanding which, as close as you have carried your secret Machi∣nations,
I am sufficiently informed of your practises; and since of my resolution I had so forewarned you, your subsequent actions have demonstrated you neither desire to see me, much loss to live with me. If Pro∣vidence has surprized and visited you with Sickness, you must consider it is for your Evil ways, and Wicked Practices you are in, and for your dealing so basely, and bar∣barously with me: If you want Attend∣ance, you can't expect that I should come to give it you: It is too long a Journey, which you have purposely taken to be so far from me; and yet to perplex me and my Mother at a distance; besides your usage of me, has made me more sickly, and too weak for such an undertaking: and if you want Women to attend you, you know where to find them in that vast and fine place you are in: and I do not doubt, but Mrs. C. and Madam A. Mrs. F. and Madam K. will afford you for old ac∣quaintance sake all the kindness and assist∣ance you can desire. Yours, Vicentina. P. S. When your Health permits, you may have now my consent to re∣turn to the Army.
The Young Lady, that did not like to insist so long on so severe a Style, be∣gan to encline to a close, and so more hastily than her Mother desired, was Subscribing her self, Your Affectionate, &c. which as soon  the Old Lady perceived, sho made her give it ano∣ther dash; and to ave out all Com∣pliments, and any thing th nded like Love and Rerio, and  Ele∣gant Composure of  to a Sick-Man and Dying , was as handsomely  decently sent away to the  Armadorus. Tho this Gallant Youth had yet made no progress in his Law-Suit, only qualified himself by his Naturalization to prosecute one if he had occasion; yet the Cunning Old Countess had very good Intelligence, as appears by the Contents of what she dictated to her Daughter; and those Anonymous Ladies which she mustered up in the latter end of the Letter, were as cun∣ningly inserted, for the perplexing of
Armadorus, and the amusing of Vicenti∣an even to madness and jealousy; some there were, that thought this bitter An∣swer was all of the Young Countesses own penning; but so much cruelty could never be lodged in a Breast that was once so loving and tender. Arma∣dorus at the arrival of this, had the hap∣piness and good fortune to be recover∣ing of his strength; and 'tis well he was a little fortifi'd against such sur∣prising, such sharp and bitter invective from one that he thought could never have been prevailed upon to hate him; He read it over again and again, disbe∣liev'd his Eyes, and doubted his Senses; thought the hand counterfeited, and her name forged; but his affection he found forc'd only this fond fancy upon him; he knew her hand too well really to doubt it; all the comfort he had left him, was the hopes that it was the effect of that power her imperious Mother had over her; and tho' it might be of her penning, yet he was persuaded it was all of the old Ladies inditing; but then a∣gain
it did not a little afflict him to find that Vicentina, who by all her Mothers threats and stratagems, Caresses and Artifices, could not be prevailed upon to refuse him for her Husband, could now be won to forsake him when he was so, to put her helping hand to such severe Satyr and reproach, and that to her languishing, (and for ought she knew) her dying Armadorus. Ah Vicentina! cry'd he; (transport∣ed with such an unexpected alterati∣on) Ah cruel Creature! Could you write these lines, and drop no Tears to wash away those Blots and black stains your Ink still left behind it! every Letter is a Character indeed, but of your unkindness; and that Hand you once would have wish'd to have wither'd, before it had been guilty of such cruelty to your Armadorus, to deny him those last favours of officious Friendship; to catch his dying sighs, and soft expiring Breath; to seal his closing Eyes, and warm his trembling Lips with one relenting kiss; to make
me barbarous and conducing to your languishment: To make me suspected and false to your Bed, that alway che∣risht you as my own Heart that I bear in my bosom; that never violated my Marriage-vow, not so much as in thought; and then as the last instance of your favour, to recommend me a∣gain to the Mouth of the Cannon from whence I only came to dye at your Feet, S'Death these are Daggers to this Heart of mine, that all the dying that I selt in my disease had not half the bit∣terness. Come, unkind, ungrateful Fair; Come Vicentina, with your own Hand and pointed Dagger, Stab this Heart of mine, and feel its throbbing pulse to beat its last; rather than thus to wound it at a distance, and tear it a∣sunder in Effigie. With that his Heart too much opprest and swoln with grief, sent forth an heavy sigh, whilst his declining Head his Shoulder bore; and the weak spine unable to support the lightned Trunk, tho' by late fick∣ness made less burthen some, the yield∣ing
Body fell back on the Bed, upon the sides of which but just before it made the first Essays to sit upright. As good luck was, the Nurse and Tender was at Hand, and by the help of some Spirits very strong and vola∣tile, which by a Spoon clapt in be∣tween his fixed Teeth, and fastned Jaws, she got within his ratling Throat; he began a little to revive, and by an Emissary Groan, the Herald and Embassador of Life, let her know that all was not gone yet; and so by de∣grees she began to get him to himself a gain, to which he was no sooner come, but to himself he seem'd another Man, and immediately repented for having had such hard thoughts of his still ad∣mired Vicentina, and so would force a kind construction from a cruel Letter of hers, that had no more mercy in it than an He Tyger can be said to have Milk. Why, faith he, have I accus'd thus injuriously my render Vicentina of cru∣elry?  only charges me with sepa∣rating my self so far from her, and so
soon; 'tis my absence perhaps has made her sicken; And these accusa∣tions I cannot deny but I have justly deserv'd; 'tis I that left her, and not she me; and those Ladies she upbraids me with as Favourites, may be only the Ef∣fects of some growing Jealousy for my long stay, which is the greatest sign of substantial Love; and what other severities of expressions I see there, may be all of her wilful Mothers dicta∣ting, whom she was afraid to disobey; all this Enchantment will soon vanish when once I shall appear again in sight. And with these Airy Consolations he seem'd to solace himself, which indeed had this good effect, that they helpt for∣ward his recovery; and qualified him the sooner to take the Countrey Air, as he design'd; for which he was no sooner capacitated, but he took Coach directly down to Danmoniorum; and to the Capi∣tal Town of the Province, where (nei∣ther considering his late weakness, nor his Ladies cruelty, having forgot the one, & put the best construction on the
other) he took Post, and with a passion that no Cold could extinguish, hasten'd away to the Embraces, as he thought, of his still Amorous Vicentina: Belie∣ving that only a single sight of his sweet self would revive in her all those flames that were wont to warm her Heart into Love and Admiration: But treacherous Love! With what vain hopes dost thou, dissembling Boy, feed the poor deluded flattering Lover! Late it was by the time that Armadorus in∣deed arriv'd at the Castle of Ogliana, but not so unseasonably but that any stranger might have found admittance; the Candles were yet burning in the Socket as he knockt, when on a sud∣den all the Snuffs went out, and all the Avenues were Barricado'd, and he himself shut in between the outer great Gate of the Palace, and the In∣ner Porch of the House; caught like a Vermin (as it were in a Trap) fore∣clos'd from going forward; and his retreat shut up behind him: In this woful condition, such as had never yet
befel him in all his wooing, was he al∣most at his wits end; often went he un∣der the Window where his dearest lay, and with a doleful voice call'd up, My Vicentina! Then to the Porch as pen∣sively return'd, and with a gentle knock admission craved, but all in vain. His Vicentina heard, but would not hear; and the Fat Cook-Maid snor'd beneath her greasy Dresser, and could not hear a Drum. Thus lockt up in a pound was the Hero fast, and forc'd to lodg all that night on the cold ground, hardly faring so well as his Horse, who was better accustomed to such a sort of lodging; and as it happen'd it was very happy that his kind Host, where he last set up, had kindly forc't upon him a good Campaign Coat; other∣wise the violent Rains that fell that night, had infallibly penetrated to his tender Skin, tho' his doleful voice could not to his Ladies harden'd Heart; he had also been accustom'd from his Youth to lye rough in the Fields when
they sorm'd a Campaign; otherwise his late distemper had sufficiently weaken'd him, so that he could not have held out the hardship of the Night; but wrapping himself up snug in his Serviceabe Coat, crept close into a Loo corner where he might be said to rest himself, but not to sleep: The thoughts of this inhumane dealing did distract him. He could not guess at the meaning, or what should merit so much barbarity: He could never imagin his Dear Vicentina could have come to that excess of cruelty, so as to suffer him to be shut out from her presence, and to lye exposed in such a night to the open Air, without any thing but his Cloaths, and the Hea∣vens to cover him; and yet he was satisfied she must needs have heard his voice, when so near to the Window of the Chamber where she alway lay; but for that she was provided of an excuse from the panick fear that her Mother had put into her head, that he might fire his Pistols at her, if she look't out.
Thus with pensive Heart, and most perplexing Thoughts he past away the tedious and uncomsortable Night, till the next Morn broke with the Eastern Dawn, saluted with approaching Day the longing Eyes of the disconsolate Armadorus: As he had rested with the Lark that Night, (tho in a colder Nest) so he was up with her too the next Morn; but had not so good Appetite to sing as that Bird generally rises with; however, being a Person of a gay and good Humour, and apt to put the best Construction upon the worst; impu∣ted it to his fault, that he came so late when all the Family was gone to Bed; and so being pleasant, even under his misfortunes, thought it would be a pretty sort of Gallantry if he should go and Serenade his own Wife under her Chamber-window, and surprize her so early with his Voice and Ap∣proach: He had obtain'd with his Con∣versation, and Facility of Apprehensi∣on, a tolerable and pretty intelligible Pronunciation of the Language of the
Country; and all the defect that he had, seem'd only like the little Lispings of a fine Lady, that at the same time advan∣ces her Features, and graces her Dis∣course, and makes both to look more Amorous: He was not to seek for Songs on any Subjects, having had so much of the Beaux, and the Beauteous Sexes Conversation, and the Academy of Compliments, that Courtuous Instructor of Strangers, had also past his hands; besides his Voice was pretty tolerable, and more passable when his Face was seen; for a good Meen and Aspect com∣monly give the pleasing turn of a good Air too; it was none of the strong∣est Voice; soft and sweet, yet high enough to ascend one Story to reach his Lady's Ear, if it could but have toucht her Heart. Muses he had no need to invoke. His Academy of Com∣pliments had a couple of Sonnets in store, that seem'd Set and Compos'd for the very purpose; so setting him∣self under the Window, he began the sorrowful old Song, tho indeed
very apposite to his sad Condition; viz. My Lodging is on the cold Ground, And very hard is my fare, But that which Troubles me most of all, Is the unkindness of my Dear. Then, &c. So home was this woful ditty to his la∣mentable Case in every Line of it, that he thought she must needs listen to it, and melt into Tears; but Marble indeed might have wept; she with her Mother's Enchantments was grown more obdu∣rate; perfect Flint or Adamant, and those hardned Minerals are best broken (we know) on a Pillow, or a Feather bed; and that he knew too, but the matters were so laid, that he was not like to come to her Bedside. In this Condition the poor Gentle∣man stood like Fidlers, that after long Scraping, many times can get neither Answer nor Money; not a word could he get for Love, nor all his kind Good-Morrow; which made him think upon another Ditty for her, to sing out of
the same Author, to this effect, and what might serve for an Answer, Go from the Window my Dear; For the Wind and the Rain, Have brought him back again, And thou canst have no Lodging here, &c. But all things were still and husht; without the least reply, or so much as looking out at the Casements. The Accomplisht Armadorus had a dexterous hand too at playing on the Base Viol; but his Instrument was out of the way; and besides, his fingers were so benumb'd with the Wet and Wind, the Rain and Cold, that he could not have plaid his part if the Instrument had been by him; wherefore trusting all to his Voice, which he knew with less labour and straining, and such ado, had formerly charm'd and enchanted Vicentina; therefore laying aside the foresaid Sonnets as old and obsolete, and so not so taking with her, tho the very Emblems of his hard usage, he began to think upon some better words, that he might at last get some Mouth-speech,
(for Musick without it, will a long time play, Loath to depart) and so pitcht up∣on a piece of more refined Poetry, and a Song that heretofore he had often de∣lighted in, even, when he little thought that the Burden of the Song should have been that too of his Breast; and that was this: Caelia, that I once was blest, Is now the Torment of my Breast, &c. But most pathetically did he warble out the latter distich that toucht both Him and Her so near; Cruel Creature! to deceive me, First to love, and then to leave me. But finding this as ineffectual as the rest, he was resolv'd only to make one Essay and Effort further, and that was in a Stanza spick and span new, brought down with him from the Court; and which could not be but a Stranger to the Country; and being well▪ compos'd by a Master of Musick, he thought might be very moving; and so lifting up his Heart and Voice, tho with a disconsolate Ela! like the dying Swan sung his last Dirge in the sweetest notes.
SONG. Quench, quench in tears, those flaming eyes, That make the World one Sacrifice; Why should it in Flames expire, Before the last and universal Fire? If we it Cruelty can doom, In the Proud Tyrant burning Rome, When to the crackling Flames he plaid, And triumpht in the waste he made. How can the Crime in You be less? When kindling the whole Ʋniverse You Pride and Boast in all your Glorious Wickedness? It was his humour to the very last to Court his beloved Spouse, as if she still had only been his Mistress; and in all his Discourses, after the severest usage, still would he admiringly, adoringly speak of his Dear Vicentina; and whatsoever the Young Ladies (to whom he would be often repeating his lamentable Tale) did compassionate and condemn, the guilt of it he would wholly lay on the Countess Davager; and that his Dear∣est, whatover, she did, was only under the Terror of her Despotick Power;
to whom she had now wholly resign'd her self as well as her Estate. After the Affectionate Armadorus had thus sported away an hour or so, in Sonetting and Serenading; after a stormy Night, and bitter Morning, rising time Approaching, between Six and Seven, he had this cold comfort, that instead of the sweet Face of his Vi∣centina, an old Woman, a sort of Doeg∣na or Governante, let her fair Visage out of the Lettice or Casement, where he thought his Dear Lady lay; and with a furrow'd Brow that wrinkled sufficiently, if she had not srown'd an∣grily, askt him what his business was there? That they did not care to be di∣sturb'd so with Heathenish, profane Songs; but if he would come again at Christmas, with a good Godly Caryl or Hymm, he should have a Pye (if any going) and a piece of Money for his pains. Armadorus smiled at the innocent Folly of the old Creature, which was a piece they had entertain'd in his Ab∣sence;
and so did not know him, nor his business; wherefore finding the Domesticks begin to stir, he went bold∣ly to the Door, and began more eagerly to knock for admittance, which now he soon had; and indeed, 't was time of Day; for during the Night there was no coming in: He askt immediately for his Wife, of whom the Servants well-instructed could give no account; then demanding to speak with the Old Lord of Ogliano, and the Countess Dowager; but they were not yet come down from their Apartments; and go∣ing to the Door where his Dearest was wont to Lodge, he found it fast lockt, and no admittance. Thus full of Doubts and Fears, he attended in the Great Hall the coming down of the Old Folks, who by Breakfast-time did appear, having better Stomachs than Armadorus, whose Appetite was a lit∣tle pawl'd with his cold Lodging; he Address'd himself to them with a Courteous and Kind Application, that had us'd him so cruelly, and now seem'd
to estrange themselves so much, that they hardly vouchsafed to know him; he demanded of them where his Wife was? The Old Countess, (that was the Manager of all, and her harmless Hus∣band only the shadow of Authority, and who with all his Worshipful and Justiti∣ary Power, could never keep the Peace at home) pertly answer'd the poor Arma∣dorus, That she was no keeper of his Wife; that she was ignorant of her a∣bode; and if he doubted of the truth of what she said, he should have all the Keys, and examine every Room in the whole House. A kindness, indeed, most generously offer'd, for it seems they had taken care to dislodge her, and send her where to be sure he was not like to find her out. So with a sorrowful heart (find∣ing himself deluded by the Craftiness of a Woman, and the easy Compliance of a Wife) he was forc'd to return to the Town of Isca, his Ancient Post, and here take up his Quarters at the same place where he set forth upon this Knight-Errantry, to go in quest of this distressed Damsel, and to wait till for∣tune
favour'd him with a more Auspi∣cious Aspect, and the Justice of the Na∣tion should restore him his Spouse with her Patrimony. 'Tis not to be exprest, how the relent∣ing Dames of the Province of Danmoni∣orum did commisserate this Gallant Hero's Injurious Treatment, and Bar∣barous Usage; which he still represent∣ed in all Companies with such a tender regard to his Wife's Honour, and Vi∣centina's Reputation, that some did not stick to tell him, that he treated her better than she deserv'd. That she had broke her Vow in Holy Matrimo∣ny, by which she was obliged to for∣sake both Father and Mother, and to cleave to her Husband. That it was too late for her to repent of a Choice that she her self had made; and to cast off a Young Gentleman that she had court∣ed into her Arms, was as base, as is was arbarous. All the Gentile Youths of the Pro∣vince were alarmed at this unparal▪ lel'd Treatment of an Husband. The Batchellors that were eagerly pursuing
their hot Loves, began to cool upon their Scent, to run counter when they saw the young Ladies to use such Shifts and Doublings; they did not know how soon it might be their Cases, should they meet with such Wives: And the young Married Husbands began to be uneasy under their Condition, not knowing how soon theirs might prove such. This made the Virgins fret to find themselves neglected by their Lo∣vers; and the young Married Women fume to find their Husbands so jealous of their Constancy; so that in short, the whole Posse of the Province, almost from Sixteen to Sixty, were ready to be up in Arms against the Old Countess and the Young, as the Common Enemy and Disturbers of their Loves, their Enjoy∣ments, their Tranquility and Repose; some execrated the old Lady, some curst the Young, and most condemn'd both; but the tender Armadorus,—who ne∣ver complain'd, that his Dear Spouse ail'd anything, but that she was troubl'd now and then with some Fits of the
Mother. And these general Murmurings and Mutinies of both Sexes for a while, made the two Countesses a little Cau∣tious how they came abroad in Pub∣lick; and as every Bodies house is the best Castle, so they kept close in theirs at Ogliano; for as nothing is more mena∣cing than a raised and enraging Mobb, so no Multitude more dangerous than that which is animated to Anger, by the abusing of their Love. 'Tis like a wild Stagg or Bull, that is disturb'd in his Amours, or Act of Coition; it shakes its clashing Beam, or brawny Neck, and bellows as it goes to medi∣tate Revenge. The Chambers of Armadorus in (this) his abdicated Condition, were the constant Resorts of the Youth of both Sexes to hear him with that humble modesty recount his Memoirs of their Cruelty: Progne's Rape, Philomela's Sto∣ry, or the Tale of Itis, were never enter∣tain'd with such attentive Abhorrence. The Ladies and Gentlemen that had not that intimacy to qualify themselves
to make him Visits, yet would con∣trive the matter so as to introduce them∣selves into his Acquaintance, and make Invitations to the Courteous Stranger, only to be present at the Relation of his Wrongs; which the injur'd Arma∣dorus did not refuse, tho it was with unwillingness he was always brought to say any thing that seem'd to dimi∣nish or detract from the goodness of his Dear Vicentina, upon whose Acti∣ons he would always cast a good Var∣nish, and place the Mother's Picture in the best Light, that it might seem the more odious, and so serve for a foil the better to set off Vicentina's; nay, the very Old Maidens and Batchelors, that were mumping upon their musty Virginities, that were past the hopes of Matrimony, would all desire his Conversation for the hearing of his Tale, and the pitying his hard and barbarous Usage; insomuch, that the Transported Armadorus would be oft surpriz'd at this Universal Friendship in a Strange Country, and did so sensibly
resent it, that he was often heard to say; He could never have hop'd to have found so many Friends in his own. This universal agreement in the Commiseration of the hard Case of Ar∣madorus, made the Old Countess con∣sider that somewhat must be done to wipe off that general Odium that was fallen upon her. And so that the World might see that it was not without some Reason that they had thus hardly treat∣ed the Helvetian, she not only got her Daughter to complain of hard usage received from him, but to go to a sort of Magistrate, Advoyers (I think) they are wont to call them in his Coun∣try; and there solemnly make Oath, That she was afraid, that her Dear Ar∣madorus had some design upon her pre∣cious Life; indeed (as has been related before) the Young Lady was deeply a∣fraid of Dying; and that her Love was like to kill her the very Wedding Night; but most People thought now that fear was pretty well over; However swear it she would, and who could help it?
The worthy Magistrate was generally Condemn'd for admitting it, where the Act seemed Rash, and the pre∣sumption of danger not so strong; but those Censures indeed were undeser∣ved; for what he did was ex officio, and so unavoidable; for should Armadorus afterward have killed his Vicentina (tho it were but with kindness), and she have Dyed within the Twelvemonth, the year and the day, (perhaps as he might have been Indicted upon the Statute of Stabbing) so the Magistrate might have been grievously Fined for not having bound him over to the Good behaviour; so after the Oath was Administred according to the form of Law and Justice, and the Custom of the Country, the Advoyers Orders, Declarations, Warrants, Placaets, were by consequence Issued out for the Apprehending, Securing, Seizing, Arresting, Detaining, Conveying, Bringing into safe Custody the Body of Armadorus, the Helvetian, late of the Canton of Bernino; and to bring
it before Him the said Advoyer, there to answer for such Infirmities and Mis∣demeanors, Violences and Insults, Offered upon the Body of Dame Vi∣centina his Wife, &c. And this In∣strument of Power, Authorities, Ju∣risdiction, being directed to all the Se∣neschals, Sbirri, Squardi, Constabularii, to execute at their utmost Peril, there was no coming for Armadorus into that part of the Country, where he would have been quickly surrounded by the Peasantry of the Neighborhood, like a Fox in a Brake, that but the Night before had worried a Lamb; but such was his good luck, and so well was he beloved, that one Advoyer, or Officer of Justice, for his sake would supercede the Warrants and Authority of Another: And our Helvetian had only the Diversion to see the Malice of his enraged Mother frustrated; and by giving some slight security to the Pub∣lick, had his Liberty of going abroad without fear of the Sbirri, or Consta∣bles. But indeed nothing Afflicted
him more than this last procedure of Vicentina's; and his Passion would oft transport him into these Complaints; Cruel Creature! whom till now I could ne're believe so, to make me such an Inhuman Monster as to have offered thee Violence, much more to have de∣signs upon thy Life! Cruel Vicentina! To-turn that tenderness I did always shew to thy Person, into the Savage∣ness of a Beast, a Beast of prey; as if I had no more Humanity than an He-Tygre; no more mercy than that has Milk, to destroy the Wife of my Bosom, the joy of my Heart, the delight of my Soul! You your self, my Dear Vicentina (tho instigated by the malice of a Mother) do not believe what you have so rashly Sworn; and how could you believe your Life in danger from him that to preserve yours, was alway ready to Sacrifice his own: All my Comfort is, the World will never be∣lieve this, tho you have Sworn it: were it true, I should be ashamed to look ever Human Creature in the Face, much
less my Father, or any of my Coun∣try-men; it must have been with kind∣ness if ever I attempted to kill you; and where you never met with the least Violence, how could you fear so much hurt? Remember how concerned I was always for your being but the least indisposed, how you could per∣ceive me to languish with you, and pine away by Sympathy. Remember how when you would needs imitate the part of a Romantick Lover, after the Reading of the Tragick Scenes of Cleo∣patra, of Lucretia, and such Heroick Ladies as had kill'd themselves for Love and the like; when you had a little overacted your part, and let the poin∣ted Sword to pierce that tender Skin: How the very sight of but one drop of Blood that it drew, was enough to touch my Heart, and draw more from thence; and your acting Death as it were to the Life, was enough to have made me dye with the sight, or even the Apprehension of it: And is this the Man that you fear will bereave you of
your Life? Is this the Man by whose hands you are so afraid to fall? Is Ar∣madorus then to kill Vicentina! how would you once have startled at the very Imagination; or abhorr'd your self, had it but entred your thoughts in a Dream: but now you have verifi'd the Catastrophe of your foreboding Vision, by making all the Serene and pleasant Scenes of it terminate even in the blackest Cloud, in Blood; and in the misery and wild distraction of us both. These were his ruthful Complaints, that all that heard them regarded, la∣mented, condoled, (but the hardned Mother, and unrelenting Wife); and therefore finding he could make no Im∣pression upon them, nor that Time that softens Iron and Stone, had turn'd their Natures, nor all the Importuni∣ties of Friends and Relations, the powers of Flesh and Blood could mol∣lify their petrified Hearts; he betook himself to the Courts of Equity and Justice, to make his Complaints and
receive Redress; who soon Authori∣zed him by a Legal Process to demand his Spouse wheresoever he might sus∣pect her to be; which accordingly he did, in a solemn manner of the Lord of Ogliano, at the Gates of the said Lord's Castle, and afterward in the Mansion-House it self; but she being deni'd there to be, or that they de∣tained any such Lady, he was left to make out his proof by Law, and a solemn Tryal; for which both sides prepared amain: The Gentlemen of the Long-Robe were engaged with Gold, and to fight it out like Switzers that were well paid (one against another). The Wittnesses were to be Mustred up by Multitudes, and to Swear lustily, and perhaps for Gold too; And being thus ranged in Bat∣talia, were all ready against the time appointed to give Battel. The adverse party had so packt their Cards, and shuffl'd the Young Lady from place to place, that it was a difficult matter to fix that of her a∣bode,
and prove where she was de∣tain'd; for Vicentina, that was now brought to stoop to all their Lures, be∣gan to disguise her self whereever she went; and she that was once like Juno's Bird, or Venus Dove, the beauty and splendor of the Day; like a Bat began only to buz about by Candle-Light, or hover like a night Bird in the dark; nor would she stir by twilight unless incog∣nito, and (once like the Italian in Mas∣querade, that would mimick at a Car∣naval a Spaniard and French-man, par∣te per pale, at the same time both in dress and gesture) she was observed to ride forth in a Cavalcade somewhat extraordinary pleasant, viz. a good rich Velvet Saddle, and fashionable, up∣on a sorry Horse with a switch-Tail that that us'd to carry Lime, and not Ladies; A gentile Surtout or riding-Suit; with her Shoulders warmly wrapt up in a good White Serge whit∣tle: A pretty handsome Commode of the newest fashion, upon which was gracefully plac'd a good homely Straw-Hat,
with a long Pole like a Sugar Loaf, so that Cit and Bumpkin seem'd never better met or set off since the Creation. Poor Vicentina! to what hard shifts, to what Obloquies and Reproaches, has thy blind submission, thy Passive Obe∣dience to an Imperious Mother reduc'd thee! But 'twas too late for her to re∣tract; she had her Irons in the Fire, she was to strike while they were hot, tho' they burnt her Fingers; and the Lord of Ogliano, he was drawn in to Es∣pouse the Cause upon the account of the old Countess his Spouse; and perhaps out of hopes, if all things went well, the Signiory of Albania, the young Countess's Patrimony might come in∣to his Family; otherwise he had the Repute of a well-meaning person, that did not love any litigiousness but what his Old Lady led him to; who having the ascendant, made her good Lord submit to such conditions, sometimes that went down with reluctancy; and Armadorus himself would alway do him that Ju∣stice, as not only to think, but to repre∣sent him as unconcern'd in those per∣plexities
they had brought upon him. The time approacht in which this great Cause was to be decided, not by Combat as of old, when Appellant and Defendant met to decide it by a Duel: The Principals, as we have heard be∣fore, had been thus engag'd on the Nuptial Night, where it prov'd but a drawn Battel; here it was come to the Dernier Resort, and almost the last Ap∣peal, except the highest, and to be de∣cided by a Judicial Sentence and Decre∣tum Finale; and for that both sides seem provided, when the Learned Podesta or Judg took his place upon the Bench. After the preliminaries of the Trial were come to be adjusted, and the Jurors and the People full of expectation to hear the Evidences, Proofs, and Dis∣proofs, whether by error in process of the one, or distrust of their cause in the other, at the instance of the adverse par∣ty, this so Remarkable Cause of Matri∣mony and Love was put off to another sitting of the Itinerary Judges: to the great disappointment of all the gay Youth and gallant Young Ladies, who
seem'd all mightily concern'd for the lovely Armadorus. But this was only a Remora that for a little while retarded the Affair, a Rub in the Way, or a Plank that their sinking Cause caught hold of; for before the succeeding Podesta, or the next sit∣ting of the Judges, it came again to be Canvass'd and to have a full and fair hearing: The Gallant Armadorus ap∣pear'd in all his bravery and splendor, and the Court of Justice was throng'd with all the gay Ladies and Gallant Gentlemen the rich Province could afford, full of eager expectation, and itching Ears, for the pleasantries and diversions that the Dialogues and Dis∣coveries of this Love-Intrigue and fa∣mous Amour might afford them. The matter was modestly discust, and so might not answer expectation, tho' it did all their hopes in the Cause being carried for the Noble Armadorus: Cannon play'd on both sides; on both sides did the evidence swear and thun∣der, that the Earth shook withal: But it being clearly made appear, 1. That
the Gallant Armadorus had actually married the Gay Vicentina, 2. That she had been de∣tained from him in the Castle of Ogliano, contrary to the Laws of Marriage. 3. That he had us'd to be very fond of her, and ne∣ver fail'd to exercise all his Faculties and ut∣most efforts, for the giving her all imagi∣nable satisfaction in her conjugal affection. 4. That this Elopement or Kid-napping, or Spiriting away of his dear Spouse was to his great prejudice; and to the hazard and temptation of a wicked violation of an Ho∣ly Conjugation. 5. That he had sustain'd great Damages, and that it had cost him very dear to pursue his Daphne, that fled and had absconded her self from him only with a design to deceive him, and by with∣drawing her fair Face, to beguile him of her fairer Fortune. 6. To consummate all, the illu∣strious Cavaliero, Signior Armadillo, Com∣mandant de Bernino, and Father of the gallant Armadorus, viva voce testify'd that his Son (our Heroick Helvetian) had Overtures made him by richer and higher persons, and that no less then 6. or 7000. Pistols had been offer'd him for Dower in his own Country; an huge summ, and sufficient to defray a Tax of an whole Canton in their Helvetique Body; amounting nearly to 77000. Livers. That the adverse party had brought an Ignomi∣nious
scandal upon their Noble Family by endeavouring secretly to deceive, and openly to traduce his Son Armadorus, the flourishing Branch and greatest Hopes of it: That in his Old Age he had undertaken a long Pilgri∣mage by Land and Sea, to vindicate his Son, by his own presence, from the scandal of being of an obscure Birth. That himself was Generalissimo to the vast Republick of the Canton of Bernino, and his Son was to suc∣ceed him in that high Command; and that he hoped (tho Strangers) they should re∣ceive Justice for their Injuries sustain'd. The Adverse party on the other hand, undertook strongly to prove, that the passi∣onate Switzer, was able to swear Thundring and Lightning Oaths; that the Young Hel∣vetian had been so robust, that he had broke all the Bonds of Matrimony: That he had taken his Ladies best Bits, and the Food she most delighred in, and barbarously given it to the Dogs. Item that longing once but for a Woodcocks Leg, he had before her face inhumanely thrown it into the Fire, and made a Grillion of what she design'd for a Fri∣cazee: Icem, That being wont to humble himself on his Knees whilst she did use to at∣tire him in her best Commode and most be∣coming dress, he was of late grown so stiff and stubborn, as to force her to kneel while
he attir'd her in his long Peruke, and cocking Beaver. Item, That he had put his Lady often into many fainting Fits that she could hardly fetch her Breath, and was ready to dye away, &c.—All which formidable Averments being made out upon Oath, made the whole Court of Ladies mightily concern'd for their admir'd Armadorus, as doubting what might be the issue of so dubious a point; and sorry that his kindness to the Female Sex should have all this sad occasion to be call'd in question; but to be short, after the Eloquent, and the Learned Lawyers, and the Councel on both sides had sufficiently Ha∣rangu'd and Satyriz'd; after the Tres Sage, and Tres Reverend the Jage, had imparti∣ally and ingenuously with much Judgment and Learning summ'd up all that had been materially said in a little, and taken the me∣rits of along cause in short-hand; It was left to the Jurors, or 12. Persons (according to the custom of the Country) to decide it by their final verdict, or Decretum finale; which soon follow'd to this effect: That consider∣ing the damages, and disappoinments he had sustain'd during the detention of his Wife and dearest Spouse, to the peril of his Continency, and the impairing of his health by abstinency, and also considering
of what evil consequences it would be to the whole Country, (and what might be every Man of them their own Case) should their Wives be suffer'd to make such extra∣vagant Elopements, and unnaturally with∣draw themselves from their Husbands to lye single when the Law obliges them to be under Coverture; They therefore in terro∣rum to all such Female Offenders, did award, declare, assign, decree, or give unto the Illustrious Armadorus, Son and Heir Apparent of the Noble Signior Armadillo Commandant de Bernino in the Country of Helvetia, the summ of 1200 Doppio's or Pistols D' Espaign, amounting to 13200. Livers French; sufficient to purchase a great Signiory or Lordship in the Canton de Ber∣nino; and at any time to be setled when she should return, and they two should bet∣ter agree, on the Dame Vicentina for her Jointure in lieu and recompence of her vast Fortune she brought him, and what was justly due to the merits of her deserving Person and extraordinary Dower. This Verdict for Armadorus, as it transport∣ed him not a little, so it affected no less al∣most the whole Court: The Adverse Party being but a few, could not obscure with their cloudy Countenances, the Serenity that seem'd to appear in every Face. The
Gallant Helvetian with a great deal of Mo∣desty, and a graceful Air, received the Ca∣resses of the gay Gentlemen, his Acquain∣tance, and the Compliments of the Young languishing Ladies, that did both admire and commiserate him: and so far was his triumph from Exalting him to insult over his vanquish'd Adversaries, or exasperating him against those that had given him all this trouble, that he offered himself soon after to be ready to receive any Proposals of Re∣conciliation with his Dear Spouse and her Relations; not so much as leaving out of the Treaty, nor excluding from the Alli∣ance, the Countess-Dowager, that by most was supposed to have done all the mischief; and did as openly and generously aver, That if his Dear Vicentina would return to her Duty, he would enter again into a League Offensive and Defensive with her: Love her more than e're she did him, or he her before; and for a more solemn Confirmati∣on of it, to Solemnize again his Matrimony, and Institute a new Festival Wedding for the utter Abolishing of all old Feuds and former Animosities. Thus far (Gentle Reader) if the soft subject of tender and exalted Love, that at last terminated in as Eternal and Extream a Discord, can move thy Breast to Admi∣ration
and Compassion, have these divided Lovers furnish'd thee with matter for both be not severe in Censuring either; since nei∣ther of them can be truly Criminated as faulty: The faults of Lovers at the worst are but Infirmities; and instead of being their Crimes, are more commonly the De∣crees of their Fate and Destiny; and 'tis their Dispensations that have afforded thee here this History (Reader) instead of a Ro∣mance. The Trojan Hero never past thro more difficult Adventures of Love and Arms than our Gallant Helvetian; hoth had an an∣gry Juno to contend with, as well as a Friend∣ly Venus that favoured them; both were in∣volved first in a Tempestuous Storm, by the furious blusterings of Eclus; and the Foam∣ing Billows of Neptune, before they could Land at the Calm-Haven of Carthage, and have a sight of their Fair and Incomparable Dido. It was both their fates to have their Queen of Beauty soon Enamoured with their goodly Personages; and the stories of their Wars, and wandrings; both pledg'd their Loves and Faith in a Storm, and me in Rain and Tempest; and both at last sadly parted without leaving so much as a little Aeneas, or young Armadillo to play with the Mother, or resemble the Dad: And this happy Disparity does alone Discontiune the
Parallel, that after all this falling out, both were agreed not to Sacrifice themselves up∣on a Funeral Pile, and foolishly to follow the Example of the most Effeminate Cartha∣ginian, in falling Victims to that fond Love and Passion which they had once so eagerly indulged, and in which of late they were so deeply engaged. And here it is time to stop the Course of History, where the Heroick Subjects of it are at a sort of stand; as they proceed further in their Adventures, they will afford the World farther Admiration in the Reading of their Lives; this will appear but imperfect, a Chasm in Chronology, and an abrupt Frag∣ment in History, unless by their Progress in Heroick Adventures, they furnish matter for a Supplement, and fill up the blanks in the next Edition, as handsomely as the last Editor has done those of Petronius. However, 'tis to be wish'd for Love sake, for Pities sake, for poor Vicentina's and her Dear Armadorus's sake, and to prevent the sad influence that such presidents and pre∣posterous Examples of wrangling Lovers may have upon raw and unexperienced Youth; to the quenching the heat of their Amours, or perverting the Nature of Conjugal Af∣fection, That a period was put to those Unnatural Divisions between so Illustrious
an Husband and so loving a Wife; that Ar∣madorus and Vicentina might meet and em∣brace again, and clasp each other in those Longing Arms with the same Love that held his Torch to the Nuptial Night. And who knows but that the Noble Armadorus might be sent to People her Albania, as the famous Aeneas, that proper and personable Dardan, once (as Bards do write) did po∣pulate and multiply upon the Fair and Fruitful Coast of Italy? The Trojans in the former Ages were only famed for their Mili∣tary Exploits, as our Helvetians are in this. Armadorus and Vicentina may both descend from as Martial Ancestors. Their very Names and Etymons, are fruitful of far-b∣ded Trophies, and big with Omens of their future Triumph: Armadorus and Vicentina seem to sound forth War and Victory, and from whose Sides and Loins may spring to populate their Land, a Noble Race of War∣like and Undaunted Heroes. FINIS.
