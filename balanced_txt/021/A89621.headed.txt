THE MARTYR Of the People, OR, THE MURDERD KING. Epxressed in severall Considerations upon His Sufferings and Death. With a Character of His Life and Vertues. Isaiah 57.1. The righteous is taken away from the evill to come. And they who set up Judicatories, and Courts of Justice, not by Gods Authoritie, but the peoples pretended Power, and proceed not as his Mi∣nisters, but as their Officers, do not indeed execute Jastice, and Judge∣ment; but kill, and murther, under pretence of Judgement and Justice. O consider this you that forget God. Psal. 50.22. LONDON, Printed in the Yeare. 1649.
The Martyr of the People: Or, the Murder'd KING. TReason, Rebellion, Blood and Murther, are inseparable com∣panions; which the loyall people of England hath groaned under these many yeers: not onely with the losse of life, Reli∣gion, Laws, Liberties, and Estates; but of our gracious King, and Soveraign; whose memory, and sad consideration, puls up all the sluces of sorrow, and lets in a flood of tears to over-whelm the Land: our calamities like a flood is lifted up above our Earth, and hath co∣vered the highest hils of our temporall felicitie; Could Judah mourn for the death of good King Josiah, and shall not England the losse of our vertuous King, Charls the Just; murdered by the most inhumane, cruell and barbarous people, that ever professed the title or name of Subjects in the Christian world. For a Parliament, called and summoned by their Soveraigns Writ and Authority, as the Representative of the Kingdom, for setling of the true Protestant Religion professed amongst us, for establishing the Laws and Liberties of people, and lawfull rights and Prerogatives of the King: And contrary to their faith, trust, and Allegiance, to raise Arms against him, and be the first subverters, and violators of Reli∣gion; Laws and Liberties; And after the tragicall Actors of murder∣ing their lawfull King before his own palace. Oh accursed act, oh blood, thirstie and perjured wretches, not to be parallel'd by Pagan or Infidell. We that were a people living in a land that flowed with milk and honey, the most happie under the Sun, happy in our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, happy in the plenty of all earthly blessings that would make us happy; happy under the government of a vertuous and pious Prince, as ever swayed the Scepter, since this Kingdom was a Monarchy: Are now become the most miserable and contemptible people in the Christian world; our losse of such a Prince as he was, is the losse of all that could make a Land or people happy in this temporall life. I shall give you a brief Character or Epitome of the personall vertues and graces of this pious Prince, which made him both glo∣rious
in life and death. And first, for his Pietie and Religion, his zeale and devout frequencie in Prayer, receiving the Sacraments, his reading the Scriptures, his reverence in Gods House, his attention to Gods Word preached, the esteeme of his Messengers, his hatred of Heresie, and the zealous care he had to propagate the true Protestant Religi∣on, which in the puritie thereof he established by his Lawes enlarged by his Regall Authoritie, and cleansed it from the rust of Atheisme, Faction, and Ignorance of the Times: His Royall Palace was a con∣stant Receipt for pious and learned men, whom he entertained and cherished; so that that which should endeare him to his people, drew neglect, by the Schisme and irreligion of these corrupted Times, who love nothing of Christianitie but the naked name: He knew, Church-maintenance was the best Nurse of Religion; and therefore no suf∣ferings, or difficulties, could so presse upon him, to alienate Gods Por∣tion, the Patrimonie of the Church; which to preserve from the sa∣crilegious invasion of the first movers of these Troubles (who thought the best way to shake off Government, was to destroy Religion, and the most effectuall and quick course to destroy Religion, was, to take away Church-maintenance) he tendred the sale of so much Crowne-Land, as would amount to the value of Church-Land. This shewed him in his life time a second David, a man after Gods owne heart, whose conversation was in Heaven. How many invinci∣ble Arguments have we of his singular sanctimonie? how that in all his greatest Tryals and Afflictions, did the abundance of his joy, and the riches of his Graces and Vertues, shine forth in all his Speeches and Actions; which shewed his contemning a temporall Crowne, for an immortall and eternall one with the King of Kings. Next, for his Wisdome and Prudence, morally considered, acting in humane affaires by the ordered rules of Reason, His Majestie was nobly accomplisht: He was furnished with a good Memorie of things past, with a sound judgement, in their reference and relation to things present, and of a cleare and quick apprehension, to discerne occurrences for the future; which were both honourable and worthy in so great a Prince as he was. In summe, he was a sober, grave, and wise Prince, as appeares in all his sufferings; when he was confined; and closely imprisoned, where he could have no Counsell but what be fetcht from Heaven, that in all the transactions betwixt Him and the Parliament he appeared the wisest King in Christendome; nay,
he better understood the constitution and affaires of his Kingdomes then any man now living: This Age shewes not a man of abilitie to take up his Princely Pen, whose stile and eloquence may be the object of their wishes, but never of their imitation. Againe, whoever looks upon the sweet influence of his Justice upon all, will appeare in the peace of his Kingdome, the serenitie of his peo∣ple, the tranquillitie of publike Affaires, the encrease of Trade, the growing riches of his Subjects, and the universall happinesse of his Government; which made these three Kingdomes thrice happy, untill the Helme of Government was wrested out of his sacred hands by these State-Empericks, usurping a Power by Blood, Murther, and de∣struction of their King and fellow subjects. Looke upon his Christian fortitude and magnanimitie, with what patience he did undergoe his Afflictions, and compose his greatest pressures in the hotest flames of Adversitie, with that meeknesse and comfort, being for Gods Cause, and his peoples Rights, that he came to the Scaffold like a Lambe to the slaughter; so chearefully he layd downe his life to the violence of his cruell Adversaries. Observe likewise his Temperance, being free from all disguize in drinke, or surfeting; a matchlesse Vertue in the best of Princes. Also his Mercie and Clemencie to the bloudie and cruell rage of his Enemies, in freely forgiving them, followed his Saviours rule, prayed for his persecutors. These Divine Graces in so glorious a King, was a firme Rock against the popular rage and swelling malice of his insulting Adver∣saries (witnesse that golden Manuel, or heavenly Meditations penned by his owne Royall hand) whose pious Devotions, and Religious life, declare him to be the Temple of the holy Ghost. From the view of his Vertues, looke upon his Sufferings, and you shall finde Envie ever maliciously attending upon Vertue; and by how much the more illustrious it is, the greater hatred perse∣cutes it: you know, the troubles of the righteous are many; be∣hold then, what sorrowes were like unto his: Consider his Sufferings from his departure from White-hall to his death, before his said Palace; and you may conclude, the Glory of England is taken from us: Remember first, how he was forced from us by tumults; his Townes, Cities, Castles, Navie, and Magazine seized upon; An
Army raised against him, and his faithfull Subjects: into how many dangers was he exposed too, chased from place to place (not having any to hide his head with-safetie) pursued with that violence, when thousands of his loyall Subjects lost their lives, yet the Lord was his preserver in the day of trouble. I shall passe by those eminent dangers the destroying Sword threatned against his Person; And tell you of his leaving his City of Oxford, and going to the Scotch Army at Southwell, his remove to Newcastle, and continuance there with them, untill he was de∣livered to the Parliament and Army (I may say, sold) his restraint at Holmby, and after hurried away from place to place as the Army moved, and so to Hampton Court, where it was the expectation of the Kingdom to see him established in his Throne, according to their League and Covenant; But by the policy of a prevalent party in the Parliament and Army (whose tralterous acts, and re∣bellious practises shall brand them with infamy to all ages) he was conveyed privately to Isle of Wight, under the pretence of poysoning, whereby the people were deluded, and their hopes frustrated. In Carisbrook Castle he was confin'd to close imprison∣ment; In which time of durance observe his patience in his great∣est tribulations, and then consider, one of the most potent Mo∣narchs of Europe, loved at home, feared abroad, most cruelly and strictly imprisoned, debarred from his wife, and hopefull chil∣dren, from the attendance of any of his servants, from Gods house, and publick worship, from his Chaplains, all his friends and loyal subjects; to lye under the weight of scandals, reproaches, wants, and miseries, tortured with unreasonable Propositions, and insolent Demands, tormented (if possible) unto perjury, sa∣criledge, and Atheisme, no conditions propounded but for sur∣rendring his Crown and Kingdoms into their hands: these were the terrible tryals of this good King in the jaws of his cruell Ene∣mies, who finding him like a rock, unmovable, they contended un∣to blood: These were they that appeared in the likenesse of an An∣gel of light: These were the Patriots of their Countrey that drive on their hellish designes under the shew of godlinesse: These are the Grandees of the Kingdom that would preserve His Majesties Person, an maintain his lawfull rights, Crown, and Dignity, by
murthering him; and after make an Act for abolishing all Kingly Government in this Kingdom. Yet to satisfie the deluded people of England, they draw up a Charge against Him, accuse him of Murther, Treason, and Tyran∣ny, (try Him after the form of Judicatory proceedings, without Law, or president) in the name of the Commons of England; and those Commons that thirsted after the blood of their King, are comprised in a factious and schismaticall Army; these are the men that establish iniquitie by a Law; the Jews dealt so with our Saviour, We have a Law, and by that Law he ought to dye. As he imi∣tated his Saviour in his sufferings; so they imitated the Jews in their persecution of him. As for instance, when he was brought to his illegall tryall in Westminster-Hall, how was he reviled, and spit upon by his barbarous and blood-thirstie Enemies; and when they cryed, Justice, Justice, and Execution: He answered not again, but with our Saviours words, God forgive them, for they know not what they say. Thus from the Throne to the Block, have they brought the most pious, religious and vertuous Prince in the Christian world. They that at first engaged against him, and was the first viola∣ters of their obedience due to His Majestie, you see punished: That power they gave to make him glorious, spilt his Innocent blood: Here you may see the fruits of Treason, Rebellion, and usurpa∣tion, in varying from Christian principles, to do evill that good may come on it: The Nationall sins of England hath powr'd this calamity upon us; as the pride, hatred, and plenty of this King∣dom produced these Wars, that faction and rebellion, that the murthering of the King, the most horrid murther that ever the Sun saw: for Subjects to murther their King; and English Sub∣jects, a people renowned for loyaltie, and beloved in all parts of the Universe; are now become the most contemptible people upon the face of the Earth. But you have made him a glorious King, and prov'd him glo∣rious in his personall Vertues, glorious in his divine Graces, and glorious in suffering for the cause of God, the true Protestant Re∣ligion, the Laws and Liberties of his three Kingdoms, and a glo∣rious Saint with the King of Glory. Yet remember for all this you shall come to judgement; for blood, murther, and schisme the
Land mournes, and Gods heavie Judgements hangs over our heads: betwixt his judgements and the Kingdomes sinnes, our King is taken from us, and his death hath made the wide in-let to all our miseries; our sorrows, like a torrent, over-flowes the Land; and a generall cala∣mity is fallen upon us. Who can forget the blessed dayes we enjoyed in his Reigne? the glory and truth of Religion, the just Execution of Lawes, Peace, Riches, and Plenty, liberty at home, protection and honour abroad; England was the Garden of the World, the perfection of beauty, and the joy of the whole Earth: but now our glory is departed from our Israel, England is become a Widow, our Churches turned into Stables, and Temples become Court of Guards; the royall Palaces of our late King, made Garisons; the patrimony of the Church, the Souldiers salary; our Lawes subverted, and our Religion and Liberty destroyed, and taken from us: we are become a prey to cruell and bloody peo∣ple, whose dayly practise is to destroy, and made slaves to the worst of Heathens, a people without God, without Faith, Law, Reason, and Humanity. For the losse of our King, the Land mournes: Hee that was the Comforter and protector of his people, is become the Martyr, he hath layd downe his life for his people, and exchanged this earthly and temporall Crowne, for an immortall and glorious one; where his eyes shall not see, nor his soul be afflicted with all the evill that shall fall upon us. To conclude, the remembrance of his sufferings and death shall eternize him glorious, so long as the Sun and Moone endureth; When the memory of his cruell and blood-thirsty Enemies shall perish from the face of the Earth. We have lost the chiefest of all Earthly things: The highest, lowest, and the best of Kings. FINIS.
