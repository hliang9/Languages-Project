A REPRESENTATION OF THE SAD Condition and Humble Desires Of the PEOPLE of GLASGOW. IT pleased the LORD, in the deep of his Wise dome and over-ruling Providence, so to dispose, that, upon the 17. of June last, 1652. being Thursday, a little before two of the clock in the after∣noon, a sudden and violent fire brake up within a narrow closse, upon the East side of the street above the Crosse, which, within a short space, burnt up six closses with diverse considerable buil∣dings upon the fore-street. And while the inhabitants of the neighbouring places of the Town were flocked together for the removall of the goods that could be gotten from amongst the fire, and hindering, so far as in them lay, the spreading of the same: the wind, blowing from the North-East, carried such sparks of the flamme as kindled unexspe∣ctedly
some houses on the West side of the Salt-Mercat, where the fire so spred, that it did overrun all from house to house, and consumed in some few hours what came in its way, not only Houses, but Goods also, both of the Inha∣bitants of that street, and of others likewise, who, when the fire began upon them, had brought to that place these of their Goods and Moveables which were gotten safe from the fire that first seised upon them. This fire, by the hand of GOD, was carried so from the one side of that street to the other, that it was totally consumed on both sides: and in it the far best and most considerable Buildings in the Town, with all the Chops and Ware-houses of the Merchants which were therein; And from that street the flamme was carried to the Tron-gait, Gallow-gait and Bridg-gait: In all which streets a great many of considerable Closses and Buil∣dings, with the best part of the moveables and commodi∣ties of the Inhabitants, were burnt to ashes. This sad dis∣pensation, from the Hand of an angry GOD, continued neer by eighten hours, before the great violence of the fire began to abate. In this short time, a great number of those who were wealthy before were extreamly impoverished, many Merchants and others neer by ruined; a very conside∣rable number of Widows, Orphans and honest Families, were brought to extream misery, the Dwellings of almost a thousand Families were utterly consumed, and many of these, who had a large Patrimonie, and oftimes had been a shelter to others in their straits, had not themselves a place where to cover their head, or knew wherewith to provide bread for them and their families, That which was preserved from the violence of the fire, being cast out in the open street, and by frequent removings thereof from one place to another, and from that to a third, and from a third place to
a fourth, as the fire occasioned, so that it was either taken away by stealth, which in such a confusion was inevitable: or in a great part so spoiled, that it was made utterly unpro∣fitable. When some hundreths of Families, in great distresse and wants, had, till the Saturnday at night, lyen in the open fields, and diverse of them were beginning to get some shel∣ter with such of their neighbours as the LORD had spared: Upon the LORDS Day, betwixt seven and eight in the mor∣ning, the fire brake up anew in the North side of the Tron∣gait, and continued burning violently till neer by twelve hours in the fore-noon. This new and sad stroke, upon the back of the other, not only destroyed diverse Dwel∣ling-houses, and occasioned the pulling down of many more▪ but it so terrified the whole Inhabitants, that all carried out of their houses what moveables they had, and took themselves again for some nights to the open fields; And in this fear, and removing of their goods from their houses to the streets, and from the streets to the fields, the losse by stealing and spoiling of goods was very great to all: and diverse, on whom the fire unexspectedly seised, were altogether ruined. As we desire to acknowledge the Justice of the LORD in this terrible stroke, having ministred so much fewell to the fire of his indignation that burns so hot against the whole Land: and to mourn under His heavy displeasure, that His further wrath against us may, in his Sonne, be averted; So are we necessitate earnestly to intreat for cha∣ritable and timous supplie from our Christian Brethren and Neighbours, whom we do in all humility request, if there be any consolation in CHRIST, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
That they would tenderly lay to heart, and consider the desolate condition of the poor Inhabitants of this afflicted Citie, and, with cheerfulnesse and a willing minde, in due season, cast some of their seed upon these many waters, for the refreshment of us who are ready to faint in this our languishing condition. As GOD hath given every one abi∣lity, so we hope they will give; A very mite, from a wil∣ling minde of these who can do no more, will be accepted of the LORD, will be to us comfortable, and, we are confi∣dent, will be no small matter of joy to themselves, in the day of their accounts, that, in this so considerable an op∣portunity of charitie, they have not hid themselves from their own flesh. FINIS.
