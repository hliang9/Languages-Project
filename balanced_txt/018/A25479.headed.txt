ODE Sancti GEORGII Die Decantata, Aprilis 23. 1686. 1. VIRI sub utroque Globo, Terrae & cujuscunque Gentes Concordes elevate mentes, Et Gratulemini JACOBO. Priorem Quo, non habet Mundus, Honorum Primus Hic est fundus, JACOBƲS Nomine Secundus. 2. Gaudete Reges Foederati! Tuba Sonet, ac Tormentum, Et omne fiat Argumentum In Laudem Regis Coronati. 3. Gallus gaudeat, ac Iberus; Danus, & Polona Pubes: Tristitiae serenent nubes Nobilitas, Anglusque Clerus. 4. Hibernus indies accrescat, Et quum Temperabit Lyram
Scotus Leo leniat Iram, Carduusque Rosâ coalescat. 5. Thamesi concurrit Tiber, Europae Magnae Mercatorum Londinum stat commune Forum, Sit homo Verna, sive Liber. 6. Olyssiponae Lusitanus Liberè nobiscum misceat Cor, ac Merces quales liceat, Et Regis Osculetur Manus. 7. Quid ambigitis Batavi? Calamitas vos quoties urget, Sospitator Is assurget Cui Patris Os, & Mens est Avi. 8. Tanti est, noster Imperator; Princeps oculatae Mentis, Martis Terror, ac Tridentis Terrâ, & Mari Triumphator. 9. Cives Portas aperite, Vestrum & salutate Regem, Qui Musas & tuetur Legem, Grantae Praes, & Bellositae.
10. Dies Iste Gloriosus; Hispania Fontes vina fundant; Dum Rubro Latices redundant, Sit nemo Moestus, aut Morosus. 11. Angliae sudum rarò certius, Aut Serenum sic affulsit, Musicâ tàm nos demulsit Vicessimus Aprilis Tertius. 12. GEORGIƲS heic JACOBO junctus; Ambo Genii Tutelares Angliae defendunt Lares; Georgius olim fato functus, Et Praesens DEI Princeps ƲNCTƲS. 13. Unanimes Britanni State, Boreae Sidus, & Occiduum, State Corpus Individuum, Et Laudem DEO Jubilate. Hic Hic est cui succumbet Mundus, Per Quem JACOBƲS Fons, & Fundus Honorum, nulli stat Secundus.
The Song sung on St. George's Day, &c. 1. LET every Kingdom, Camp and Court, Whose Natives to this Realm resort, Congratulate That Prince, whose Name's (As His Blest Grandsire's was) King JAMES; Second by Name, but in the Throne, And Orb of Honour, shines Alone, And There sits Second unto None. 2. Let all Confederate Kings and Powers, Whose Kingdoms are at Peace with Ours, Rejoyce; Whilst Trumps and Cannons Ring, The Loud Elogiums of Our KING. 3. Let France and Spain disband all Fears; With Denmarks, and great Polands Peers; Whilst Nobles, with the Clergy, clear All Clouds arising in Our Sphear. 4. When Ireland Tunes his Charming Lyre, Stout Scotland's Lyon doth retire,
And her Pungent Thistles close In Ʋnion with our English Rose. 5. Thames and Tiber both Combine; And Londons made the Magazine Of Merchandize; in each Degree, Where Men do meet, both Bond, and Free. 6. Lisbond's Rich, and Royal Pile, Freely Traffiques with Our Isle In most Commodities of the Land; And Joys to Kiss Our Soveraign's Hand. 7. Belgia then no more distrust A Prince, whose Prudence can Adjust All Diff'rences, in whom you'll find His Father's Face, and Grandsire's Mind. 8. So Qualifi'd is He to Reign, Whose Active Body, and Strong Brain, Puts Mars and Neptune to the stand, He Riding Lord by Sea and Land. 9. Ye Citizens, set wide Your Gates To Him who is the THREE ESTATES Sole Prop; A Prince of Deep Discerning, Pillar both of Law and Learning.
10. This is a Day of Jubilee; Let all be Debonair, and free To Quaff what London's Conduits carry, Burdeux Wine, or Old Canary. 11. Musick ne'er was better heard On such an April's Twenty Third, Than This, where Air and Earth conspire In Consort to make up the Quire. 12. For GEORGE and JAMES Our Tutelary Guardians, joyntly keep and carry A Correspondence, GEORGE Translated Long since to Bliss, and there Instated; And JAMES by Heaven's Decree appointed Britain's Ruler, GOD's ANOINTED. 13. To Him let Britain's North and South, Give Praise with Mutual Heart and Mouth, And cleave in Love and true Communion To Him, who is the GOD of Ʋnion. 'Tis HE, 'Tis HE that can alone Guard and support Great JAMES his Throne, Who sits here SECOND unto None.
Cantilenam Concludamus cum Authoris Actione Gratiarum post Prandium. GRates DEO Tibi damus Pro Donis Vestris; & oramus Ut Rex JACOBUS diu vigeat, Nec Britannus Orbs indigeat Rege Nato de JACOBIS, Donec adsit SHILO Nobis. Amen. We will conclude this Gratulatory ODE with the Author's Usual Grace after Dinner. LORD, Give us humble and right thankful Hearts For all the Blessings which thy Love Imparts: And-Bless our Sacred Soveraign King JAMES, Who of His Royal Line, and Christian Name's Fourth Monarch of Great Britain; Scotlands Seventh, King of both Realms th' Hundred and Eleventh: LORD Grant that from His Seed there ne'er want One Till SHILO come, to sit upon the Throne. Amen. FINIS.
