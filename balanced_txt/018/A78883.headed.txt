HIS MAIESTIES MESSAGE Sent the twentieth of May, MDCXL III. CHARLES R. SInce His Majesties Message of the twelfth of April, (in which He conceived He had made such an overture for the immediate disban∣ding of all Armies, and composure of these miserable and present Distra∣ctions by a full and free convention of Parliament, that a perfect and set∣led Peace would have ensued:) Hath in all this time, above a full Month, procured no answer from both Houses; His Majesty might well believe Himselfe absolved both before God and man, from the least possible charge of not having used His uttermost endeavours for Peace. Yet when He considers that the sense of all this Calamity is in the bowels of His owne Kingdome, that all the blood which is spilt of his owne subjects, and that what victory soever (it shall please God to give him) must bee over those, who ought not to have lifted up their hands against him, when he considers that these desperate civill dissentions may incourage and invite a forreigne Enemy, to make a prey of the whole Nation: That Ireland is in present danger to be totally lost: That the heavy judgements of God, plague, pestilence, and famine, will be the ineviable attendants of this unnaturall contention: And that in a short time, there will be so generall a habit of uncharitablenesse and cruelty contracted through the whole Kingdome, That even Peace it selfe will not restore his people to their old temper and security; His Majesty cannot but againe call for an Answer to that His Gracious Message, which gives so faire a rise to end these unnaturall distractions: And His Majesty doth this with the more earnestnesse, because he doubts not the condition of His Armies in severall parts, the strength of Horse, Foot, Artillery, His plenty of Ammunition, (when some men lately might conceive He wanted) is so well knowne and understood, that it must be confest, nothing but the ten∣dernesse and love to His People, and those Christian impressions, which alwaies live, and He hopes alwayes shall dwell in His heart, could move Him once more to hazad a refusall: And He requires them as they will answer to God, to Himselfe, and all the World, that they will no longer suffer their fellow Subjects to welter in each others bloud, that they would remember by whose authority and to what end they met in the Coun∣cell; and send such an Answer to His Majesty, as may open a doore to let in a firme peace and security to the whole Kingdome. If His Majesty shall againe be disappointed of His intentions therein, the bloud, rapine, and destruction, which may follow in England and Ireland, will be cast upon the account of those, who are deafe to the motive of Peace and Accommodation. OXFORD, Printed by Leonard Lichfield, Printer to the Vniversty, 1643.
