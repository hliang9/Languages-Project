Labour not for the meate that perisheth, but for the meate that endureth to eternall life. PRINTED BY IOHN LEGAT, Printer to the Vniversitie of Cam∣bridge. 1605.
To the Christian Reader. I Can not but earnestly la∣ment (good christan Rea∣der) as I hope thou dost with me, these miserable times wherein we liue behoulding the great number, already growne and daily encreasing, of wicked atheists, superstitious papists, prophane wordlings, carnall gospellers, vaine and idle professors and great multitudes of ignorant people euen in the principles of religion in this land. Notwithstanding the gospel hath beene so long & plentifully preached amongst vs, so many godly books published, both of the interpretation of scriptures and also of other learned and holy treatises by sundry worthy men, so many excellent and profita∣ble catechismes, set forth and fitted for teaching the grounds of religion to all sorts of people. So as we may iustly weepe ouer cities, townes, and villages as the Lord Iesus did ouer Ierusalem.Luc. 19.42. Oh that you had known euen in this your day those things that be∣long vnto your peace. But now are they hid from your eyes; for ah alas who seeth not,
almost in all places, the mightie sinnes of the land, crying for vengance: That that may iustly be pronounced vnto vs which the prophet denounceth to Israel.Hosea. 4.1. Heare the word of the lord O people of England. The lord hath a controuersie with the inhabi∣tants of the land, because ther is no truth, no mercie, no knowledge of God in the land, by swearing and lying and stealing and killing and whoring they breake out, and blood toucheth blood. Wherefore it is great∣ly to be feared that seeing wisedome hath cryed vnto vs so long,Pro. 1.20.25.26. &c. and vttered her words so lowd abroad in the streets, in the assem∣blies, in citties and townes, and all sorts haue refused, none would regard her cal∣ling, least shee also laugh at our distruction, and mocke when our feare commeth like a sodaine desolation, and our destruction like a whirlewind and a tempest, to sweepe vs a∣way headlong into the gulfe of all miseries and calamities. The Lord in mercie raise vs vp out of our deadly sleepe of sinnes and securitie that we may awake to liue righte∣ously and sinne no longer. Many of vs haue in our mouths, vainly boasting as the people of Israel,Ier. 7.4. the temple of the Lord, the temple
of the Lord, we haue the temple of the lord, so wee the gospell of Christ, the gospel of Christ, we haue the gospel of Christ, but ah alas many thousands of vs knowe nothing what the gospell meaneth. A multitude of people throughout the land haue not yet learned the very beginnings of the doctrines of Christ, of repentance from dead works: of faith towards God, of baptisme, of laying on of hands, of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternall iudgement, nay not so much as what sinne is, or how they becam sinners, what the punishment of sinne is, or how they may scape it. Many thousands know nothing what sinnes are forbidden, what duties are required in any of the com∣mandements, they vnderstand not any ar∣ticle of the faith aright, any petition of the Lords praier, the meaning of the sacra∣ments, or any thing that belongeth to a chri∣stian life. O that we would learne in time to repent and turne vnto the lord,Ier. 4.4. before his wrath breake forth vpon vs like fire, and burne that none can quench it, for the wic∣kednes of our inuentions. Euen this were one good meanes if all parents and householders would set apart some howre euery day to
pray with their children and seruants, & vse some for catechisme to enforme them∣selues, and their familie in the grounds, and principles of religion,Deut. 6.6.7.8. & 11.18.19. Ephes. 6.4. Genes. 18.19. Iosu. 24.15. Act. 10.21 as they are bound in duty by the commandements of the Lord and taught by the example of Godly fathers and howseholders in the scriptures, namely Abraham, Iosua and noble Cornelius. So should themselues, their children & their seruants bee better prepared and fitted to vnderstand the word of God & the doctrines thereof deliuered vnto them by their godly pastors and ministers, which now they heare most vnprofitably, and after much and long teaching learne nothing at all. Amonge other catechismes I haue found by long ex∣perience this one to bee of very fit and profi∣table vse, for the instruction of a family, beeing plaine and easie and not longer then may euery seauen daies be repeated through, being fitly deuided. For the questions concer∣ning fasting and gouerment may bee omit∣ted, except there bee speciall occasion, this may bee done and praier ioyned withall in litle more then halfe an hower at one time. I confesse some good part of this was published many yeares since, gathered out of another
cathechisme by a godly and reuerent prea∣cher M. Moore of Norwich, which I haue altered and enlarged in many places with such questions and answers as I thought meete for the instruction of the simple and vnlearned, vnto which I haue added cer∣taine praiers for the helpe of such as are not yet able to conceiue a prayer of themselues. I wish thee (good Reader) whosoeuer wilt vse it, to examine with the doctrines the places of scripture quoted, some of them at the least though not all: otherwise thou shalt depriue thy selfe of a great benefit and comfort. This poore mite amid my ordinarie la∣bours at the request of some freinds, I haue cast into the Lords treasurie, If thou pro∣fitt by it remember me in thy praiers. And so I commend thee to god and to the word of his grace, who is able to build further, and to giue thee an inheritance among them which are sanctified. And the Lord giue thee vnderstanding to growe in grace & in the sound knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, to whome with the father and the holy Ghost be ascribed all glory and praise power, ma∣iestie
and dominion now henceforth and for euermore. Thy poore louing brother in Christ, Iames Leech.

All those things which are written in the bookes of the old and
new testament. 2. Pet. 1.19. & 3.2. Q. Why be they called canonicall? An. First because they differ from other writings called Apocrypha.

Gen. 1.28. Q. Did man and woman continue in this happie place and excellent e∣state? An. No, they were quickly throwne
out from thence for their sinne and transgression through the subtiltie and malice of Sathan,Gen. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.23.24. 2. Cor. 11.3. rebelling against god their creator, and so cursed and con∣demned to eternall death and damna∣tion both of soule and bodie, in which estate they had remained and all their posteritie for euer, if God of his free mercie had not prouided a wonderfull way of deliuerance.

What is that remedie or what
haue wee to answer before the iudg∣ment seat of God that we should not bee condemned for euer? Ioh. 3.17.36.An. This is our only remedie and it is the full satisfaction of gods wrath & our deliuerance from cōdemnation to beleeue that Iesus Christ the sonne of God hath vouchsafed to become man for vs, and hath so pacified gods wrath due vnto vs,2.

Q. what meane you by the naturall an? An. He whose heart and conscience  not renewed,1. Iohn. 3.10. Rom. 12.2. purged and sanctified y the spirit of grace, through faith & pentance in Iesus Christ.

Cor. 13.9.12. for all our righteousnes is s a stained clout, and there is no per∣fection
in this life. Q. Why say you then that the ¦generate man doth not commit sinn An. He is not said to commit sinn because it is not he that sinneth,Rom. 7.15.17.20. b sinne that dwelleth in him. Q.

It is an eternall separation fro the fauour of God and all his merci which hath adioyned vnto it all mis¦ries and calamities of this life, death  the end, and eternall torments both  soule and bodie in hell euer after. Ma 5.29. Math. 22.13. Reuel. 20.1 14. Q. Is there nothing which a ma may doe to serue as a sufficient reco¦pence to God for one sinne? An. No, although I should giueLuke. 17.10. all my goods to the poore, or suffe my bodie to be (b) whipped all my li long,Col. 2.23. or suffer any other punishme which might be deuised, yet it were no sufficient for one of my least sinnes.
Q. Why so? An. For sinne is infinite, because it offendeth the infinite maiestie, & there∣fore deserueth an infinite punishment. Psal 51.4. Q. Yea but God1. Cor. 1.3. Psalm. 18.45. & 86.15. is mercifull will he therefore punish sinne so sharpely? An. Our God indeed is mercifull but he is alsoPsalm. 7.9. Psalm. 11.5. Rom. 3.4. Ioh. 3.33. iust and true, & there∣fore of his iustice and truth he must needs punish mans sinne with that pu∣nishment which he hath appointed. Q. Seing then this punishment must needs be suffered, are we in our selues able to suffer and ouercome it? An. None is able to sufferPsal. 130.3. Math. 19.25. and ouercome this great punishment of sinne being onely man. Q. What learne you out of this? An. That my state is most miserable in respect of the greatnes of my sinne and the horrible punishment due vnto the same. Rom. 7.24. Q. What profit is it to you to knowe this your miserable estate? An. First I am taught thereby to knowe mine owne vnworthines, and
that I should not seeke to bee saued by mine own works or meritsDeut. 7.7. Deut. 9.6. Dan. 9.18. Second∣ly to bewaile this my miserable estate with a godly sorrowRom. 7.24. 1. Cor. 7.9.10. Thirdly to de∣test and abhorre sinne because it bring∣eth nothing with it but the curse of GodRom. 6.21.23.

Is there any meanes whereby we may be deliuered from this misera∣ble estate? A. Yes: there is a meanes which is taught vnto vs in the 3. of Iohn. For God so loued the world,Iohn. 3.16. that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, that whoso∣euer beleeued in him should not pe∣rish, but haue euerlasting life. Q. What learne you out of this? A. That whereas the paines which our sinnes deserue must needes be suf∣fered by man, because God of his iu∣stice must needes punish sinne in man, which was committed by man: there∣fore our Sauiour Christ beeing euerla∣sting god, became alsoGal. 4.4. Heb. 2.9.10.14.15.16.17. Heb, 4.15. 1 Tim. 2.5. Rom. 8.3.4. man, & hath

Are all people discharged, see∣ing the punishment is paid? A. None are discharged sauing those that tookeCol. 2.2. 1 Iohn. 3.2. Eph. 3.12. Rom. 8.38.39. Eph. 1.18. Ephes. 2.8. Acts. 15.11 hold vpon Christ and his merits by a true faith. Q. What call you this true faith? A. It is a speciall worke of Gods spirit in our hearts, whereby we be∣leeue to be saued by the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ. Q. What doe you see by this true faith? A. My sinnes both to be forgiuen me, and yet fully punished. Q. How can that be? A. For in Iesus Christ to2 Cor. 5.21. Rom. 3.25. satisfie Gods iustice they be1. Ioh. 2.1.12. Gala. 3 13. Rom. 4.25. fully punish∣ed, and yet to me they be1. Cor. 5.9. forgiuen, because in me they be not punished, but in Christ for me to set forth Gods mercie: and therefore they shall neuer be laid to my charge: in this manner therefore I see the Lord my God to be both mercifull and iust. Q. Yea but although the punish∣ment
of thy sinnes be fully discharged in Christ, yet seeing there can no vn∣righteousnesse dwell with God, how canst thou stand before the iudgement seat of God as iust and righteous, see∣ing thou hast no righteousnes but that which is stained with many sinnes? A. I stand as iust and righteous be∣fore the throne of God, not cloathed with my owne righteousnes, but with the1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21. Rom. 3.28. righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, which righteousnes beeing taken hold vponEphes. 3.17. Rom. 3.28. Ioh. 3.18. by a true faith, is made mine: thus am I iust and righteous in the sight of God, not in respect of my own workes which I wrought in my owne person, but by taking hold vpō Christs works to be mine by faith. Q. Doth not this doctrine make men carelesse, & so runne into all sinne and wickednes? A. No: for this true faith as soone as it is wrought in vsIoh. 3.3.5. Eph. 4.20. Colos. 3.9. Rom. 6.6. & 12.1.2. through the holy Ghost, doth frame our hearts a∣new, and causeth vs toRom. 7.23. detest, hate, loath, and abhorre sinne in all men, but especially in our selues, and maketh vs

Gala. 5.6. dead faith. Q. What difference is betweene a dead faith, and a true faith? A. A dead faith is like a barren and withered tree that bringeth forth no fruit: a true faith is like a liuing and fruitfull tree that euer bringeth forth good fruit to the glorie of God. Q. What be the fruits of a true faith? A. A continuall and true repen∣tance, and euery good grace of Gods spirit, and all the good workes which he hath ordained for vs that we should walke in them.

That change and renewing of the whole man that bringeth forth a new, Christian, and holy life and conuersati∣on, growing and increasing more and more.
Q. How many things be required in true repentance? A. Two: the mortifying and sub∣duing of sinne, and the liuing & grow∣ing in the practise of true godlines and righteousnes: 2. Cor. 7.1. both which doe proceede from the vertue of the death and resurrection of Iesus Christ,om. 6.2.3.4.5.1.12. m. 12.1.2. l. 3.1.2.5.9. 1. Pet. 1.2..23.

We must doe good workes, not to deserueEsay. 46.6. b. 35.7. al. 17.2. ik. 17.10. saluation by them; but by our works toat. 5.16. or. 6.20. t. 2.12. ol. 1.10. l. 1.27. & 2. glorifie God inThes. 2.12. h. 4. & 4.1. wal∣king as becometh Gods childrenRom. 6.11, 3. & 12.1.2., declaring thereby our thankfulnes to God for our redemption.

What works callest thou good works? An. Our worke can neuer be accep∣table and good in the sight of God vn∣les
in doing of them wee keepe these two things; first thatEph. 2.10. Collos. 2.10.22.23. Esay 9.13. Mat. 15.9. Rom. 14.23. Heb. 11.6. 1. Cor. 5.7. they be framed according to the will of Gods lawes and commandements and not after our owne deuises. Secondly that they proceede from an heart purged by fairh; if either of these points be lacking our works are abhominable in the sight of God al∣though they appeare neuer so glorious in the eyes of men. Q. What things ought euery one to beleeue which hath this true faith in Iesus Christ with out the which none can be saued?4. parte. An. All those things which are con∣tained in the articles of our christian faith. Q Rehearse the articles of our chri∣stian faith A. I beleeue in God the father al∣mightie maker of heauen and earth and in Iesus Christ his only sonne our Lord which was conceiued by the holy ghost borne of the virgin Marie suffered vn∣der Pontius Pilat was crucified dead and buried he decended into hell the
third day he rose agane and ascended into heauen and there he sitteth at the right hand of God the father Almigh∣tie, from thence he shall come to iudge both the quicke and the dead. I be∣leeue in the holy Ghost, the holy Ca∣tholike Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiuenes of sinnes, the re∣surrection of the bodie, and the life e∣uerlasting. Amen. Q. What things are contained in these articles of your christian faith? An. First what we ought to beleeue concerning God. Secondly what we ought to beleeue concerning Gods people called the Church. Q. What ought we to beleeue con∣cerning God? A. First, such things as concerne God in his nature and essence. Second∣ly, such things as concerne God in his actions. Q.

Matth. 3.16, 17 & 28.19. Q. What ought we to beleeue con∣cerning God in his actions? A. First,Rom. 11.34.35, 36. Rom 9.11.22, 23. that he hath decreed and ordained all things in his eternall pur∣pose and counsell before all worlds. Secondly, that by his Almightie pow∣er he hath made the heauens and the earth, and all the creatures therein. Thirdly,Mat. 10.39.30. Psal. 115.3. & 135.6. Psal. 145 17. that he doth rule & gouern them and all their actions according to the good purpose of his owne will most holily, righteously, and wisely. Q. Why is God called Almightie? A. Because he is of all-sufficient power in himselfe to worke all things according to the good purpose of his owne will,Ies. 42.8. & 4 13 & 44.24.2 & 49.7. Mat.  29.30. so as nothing can be done in heauen, earth, or hell, without his
prouidence. Act. 4.28. Q. Why doe you call God father? A. First, in respect of creation. Se∣condly, in respect of adoption. Q. Why in respect of creation? Rom. 11.38. Acts. 17.25.38.A. Because of him, from him, and by him all things haue their beeing & beginning. Q. Why in respect of adoption? Eph. 1.5. Gal. 4.5.6.A. Because he hath adopted those whome he hath chosen to be his chil∣dren in Iesus Christ. Q. What comfort haue you in this that you call God father? A. I learne thereby that he loueth me, and hath a most tender care ouer me. Psal. 103.13. Rom. 5.5.8. Q. What comfort haue you in this that God whome you call father is Al∣mightie? A. I learne thereby that he can and will defend me from all euill, so as no∣thing can hurt me, and that he can and will giue me all things that be good for me in this life, and in the life to come. Q. Why so?
An. He can because he is almightie, he will because he is my louing father. Q. What dutie doe you learne here concerning your selfe? An. That I should honor him as my heauenly father.Malech. 1.6. Q. How? An. In louing him, fearing him, re∣uerencing him, and obeying him the sixt commandement. Qu. Wherin must we shew forth this? An. In the care that I haue to keepe his commandements. Q. Wherin standeth the keeping of the commandements? An. In doeing those good things which the lord hath commanded; and in leauing vndone those euill things which the lord hath forbidden. Q.

Heb. 2.14.15. Rom. 8.3. and in my nature hath wrought whatsoeuer was needfull for my salua∣tion. Q. What meanest thou when thou saiest he suffered vnder Pontius Pilate An. Because that manner of death which men doe suffer by the sentence of the iudg & vnder the title of iustice, is more shamefull, slanderous and terri∣ble, then if a man should die naturally in his bed: Therfore our sauiour Chris tooke vpon him our person to shew himselfePsal 2.2. Acts. 4.27 before an earthly iudg and to beMat. 27.16. Ioh. 19.1.13.23. condemned by the mouth of Pilate he beeing then Iudg, that there∣by we might bee cleared before the iudgement seate of God. Q. What meanest thou when thou sayest Christ was crucified dead and buried? An. First I meane in that he was crucified that he sufferedLuk. 23.33. the death of the Crosse which was an abhomi∣nable and cursed deathGal. 3.13.14. to deliuer me from the curse which was due for my sinnes. Secondly for as much as death was a punishment due to man
for sinne; therefore our Sauiour Christ d suffer death and by suffering ouer∣me death; for in his death did lie  principall point of our saluation; r if he had not bin trulyEsay. 53.12. Rom. 5.8. 1. Cor. 15.3. 1. Pet. 2.24. dead we d bin yet subiect to eternall death d damnation. Thirdly he was buried r the greater assurance and confirma∣on of his death, and resurrection, and  the intent to make it more certainely owne vnto vs, it pleased him also to e buried after the common manner of men, and that by two Notable per∣sonsMat. 27.57. Mar. 15.43. Luke 23.53. Nicodemus and Ioseph of Ara∣athia, which was also doone by the will and consent of Pilate who caused the bodie to be deliuered vnto them. Q. What meanest thou concerning that Christ descended into hell? An. Where it is sayd that Christ descended into hell therby I beleeue that Christ did not only suffer in his bo∣dy the punishment due to my body,Esay. 53.4.8.10. but also in his soule the punishmēt due to my soule,Luk. 2.44. which was the tor∣ments of hell,Luk. 23.46.

What fruite hast thou by th death of Christ? An First I beleeue that this dea and punishment which Christ suffere is the whole appeasing ofHeb. 9.12.13.14.28. 1. Pet. 2.24. 1. Ioh. 2.1. go wrath and a full satisfaction to god f all my sinnes. Secondly thatGala. 5.24. Gala. 2.29.7.8.1. as he is dead f sinne so he will cause sinne to die i my mortal body. Q. What profitt hast thou by th rising againe of Christ? An. First I am assured by this risin that he hath1. Cor. 15.55.56.57. Rom. 8.33.34. Rom. 4.15. overcome death hell, sinne and finished my iustification▪ Secondly that as he is risen from deat so he causeth me as a member of hiRom. 6.4. Colos. 3.1.2. to rise from sinne and delight i righteousnes. Thirdly his rising again
a sure pledge1. Cor. 15.16.0. to me that my body hall in like manner rise againe. Q. What is the meaning of this at Christ ascended into heauen? An. Christ as touching his man∣ood isAct. 1.11. Act. 3.21. onely in heauen: butMat. 28.20. as ouching his godhead and comfort of is holy spirit he is with vs to the end f the world. Q. What good gettest thou by the scending of Christ into heauen? An. First Christ his ascending into eauen is a sure pledge vnto me thatIoh. 14.3. Phil. 3.21. 1. Cor. 1.7. 1. Thes. 4.16.17.  shall in like manner as a member of y his power be receiued into heauen  the same nature wherein he is ascen∣ed. Secondly Christ hauing ascended nto heauen1. Ioh. 1.2. Heb. 9.12. Rom. 8.32. maketh cōtinuall inter∣ession for me. Q. What meane you by this that Christ sitteth at the right hand of the father? An. Christ sitteth at the right hand of the father, that is, he hathMat. 28.18. Eph. 1.20.21.22. all power giuen him of the father ouer all things, being exalted into the full power of his kingdome and preisthood & made the
only head of his Church. Q. What fruit doest thou receiue this that Christ shall come to iudge quick and the dead? An. To me that am a member  Christ it is singular comfortMat 24.31. Mat. 25.34.

and are represented vnto vs by the outward signes of water in Baptisme, and bread and wine in the supper of the Lord, they serue also for a marke of our profession whereby we differ from other people which be heathen. Q. Tell me more shortly what is a sacrament? A. An outward signe ordained of God,Rom. 4.11. and a seale to assure vs that we are made partakers of Christ Iesus and all his benefits vnto saluation, if we doe truly beleeue in him. Q.

For as the water washeth away the filthines of the bodie, euen so should I by the holy Ghost be thereby fully certified and perswaded, that1. Pet. 1.2.19. 1 Ioh. 1.7. Eph 5.26. Tit. 3.5.6. Acts. 22.16 the blood of Christ beeing sprinkled vpon my soule by theActs 15.. hand of faith, hath washed away both the guiltinesse of my sinne, and the horrible punishment due to the same, the fruite and effect wherof appeareth herein that through the power of Christs death and resur∣rection I am deadRom. 6 3. 6. &c. as touching sinne, and raised vp againe2. Cor. 5.17 Gala 5.24.25 to newnesse of
life. Which two things in whomesoe∣uer they appeare not, they may well haue the name and title of baptisme, but indeede they are no true Christi∣ans. Q. What meane you by the supper of the Lord? A. The sacrament of our growth and spirituall foode, whereby we are to be nourished till we come to a per∣fect age in Christ. Q. What benefits of your saluati∣on are sealed vnto you in the supper of the Lord? A. The supper of the Lord through the holy Ghost doth strengthen my faith, that I should not doubt but be∣leeue assuredly that as I receiue the bread and wine into my bodie to be∣come wholly mine, so myMat. 26.20.7.28. soule re∣ceiueth withall, through faith, Christ with hisCor. 10.16.17.  11.26.27.28. 1.

bodie and blood of Christ? A. The bread and wine as touch∣ing their nature and substanceMat. 26.26.27.28. 1. Cor. 10.16.17. & 11.24.25. & 12.13. are not turned, but as touching the vse of them they differ from common bread and wine, in that they are appointed of god to serue vnto vs asRom. 4.11 sure seales and pledges of those benefits of our saluation which Christ in his bodie hath wrought for vs. Q. What persons are fit to be par∣takers of this sacrament? A. Such as are able and doe fitly prepare themselues. Q. In what manner oughtest thou to prepare thy selfe to receiue such ho∣ly mysteries? A. In preparing my selfe to receiue the supper of the Lord, I ought dili∣gently to obserue these three things. First, to1. Cor. 11.28. examine my selfe whether I2. Cor. 13.5. stand in faith or no, which I shall know if I feele myEph. 1.13. 2. Cor. 1.22. & 5.5. heart inwardlyRom. 8.15. Eph. 3.12. assured by the spirit of God, that the1. Ioh. 2.1.2. punishment of my sinnes is fully discharged in Christ, and that whatso∣euer he hath wrought for mans salua∣tion

Thirdly, if any of∣fence be betwixt others and me, that IMat. 5.23.24. reconcile my selfe vnto them all, which things although they ought ear∣nestly to be considered in theLuk. 1.74.75. .
