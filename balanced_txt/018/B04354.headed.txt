A Messenger of Truth From the Common Hall, Assembled in London on MIDSƲMMER-Day last: Or an ACCOUNT of The Pretended Petition. With Allowance. WHereas there hath been lately a printed Paper, spread abroad under the Title of, An account of the Pro∣ceedings of the Common-Hall, on Midsummer-day last; thereby pretending it to be done to prevent Misre∣presentation; and asserting a Petition therein set forth, to be unanimously approved of and agreed upon by that pub∣lick Assembly of the Livery, (representing the whole City of London,) to be presented to the High Court of Parliament. We cannot imagine that Paper was so Printed and Published with any colour of Authority; but must rather conclude it was done (as maliciously designed) by some ill minded Persons, to castan Odium on this great City, and to create Misunderstandings between his Majesty's Subjects, under a disguise of Opposition to Popery. 'Tis true, and cannot be denyed, that a small number of Citizens (when so duly assembled) do make a Common-Hall, and the Petition in that sence, may not improperly be so styled: But it doth not from thence follow, that the Matters contained therein were assented unto, so as to be approved of, and desired by more Persons than were so assembled together, and approving of the same, when it was read and proposed to them. And therefore we do judge it a duty highly incumbent on us, (as we are Members of that great Body,) to prevent, as much as in us lies, the evil Influence that Paper may have on the Minds of easie and cre∣dulous Persons: To the end Truth it self (which needs no little arts or tricks to support it) may by its own sinews, prevail to undeceive such as have been already mis-informed thereby. We pass by the Matter of the Petition, and what entertainment it met withal from the House of Commons, as more fit for consideration of our Superiours. And only take notice, how vehement and earnest some Men were, in that great Assembly, to put the Commoners in Nomination before the sitting Aldermen, which greatly suprized many of the Electors; and it was manifest scarce one in twenty understood the Question when it was put, in regard of the Noise and Opposition, which was made by those that did apprehend it: And it could not but be matter of trouble (to such as soberly desire and consult the publick Peace and Tranquillity of this City) to observe what earnest endeavours were used to invert Order and Decency therein, (as it were, shifting Feet and Face,) by postponeing such as are already advanced to the Dignity of Senators, to their Inferiours in Nomination.
And to behold such a zeal for particular Persons, as if they had com∣bin'd and determin'd before they came there (as one Man) to carry on a Design, rather for a particular Interest, than the whole, and with so much Heat and Passion, as if they would proclaim a prejudice towards all that opposed. These things we briefly touch upon, as matters deeply to be resented by every good Citizen, so as to endeavour they may be laid aside for the future, to promote that peaceable Temper and publick Spirit, that should govern in every Breast, in order to prevent caballing, and private Clubs, to serve a Turn, to the hazard of our Publick Weal. And we shall now plainly declare what followed the publick Election; for Truth whereof we appeal to those many Hundreds then present, who are all ready to attest the same. When the choice of the Sheriffs, Chamberlain, Bridge-Masters, and Ale-Conners were made, we concluded the Work of that Day was over, not dreaming in the least of this Petition, or any other to be set up: But the Livery (as in a Congregation, when Sermon is ended) made all towards the door, crowding to get out, as we our selves did when many hundreds were gone before, and others pressing after; but never heard one Word of this Petition, till from the Votes of the House of Commons, which put us upon enquiry of our Brethren concerning it. And at length we were informed by those that happened to be in the reer, that when most part of the Members were gone, (or going away,) this Petition was proposed to be read; and that they) with the rest re∣maining) out of curiousity to know the Contents, held up their Hand for the reading of it; but solemnly affirmed, That many (of those so remaining) who so held up their hands for reading it, did not hold up their hands for presenting it. We shall close with our hearty Prayer to Almighty God, to make us every one sensible, how far we have all (even the best of us) come short of our Duty, that we may search our Hearts, and try our Ways, and see what cause we have all to humble our selves under the mighty Hand of God, both for our Hypocrisie and Prophaneness. And that we may all of us endeavour to lay aside Pride, Passion, and Self-love, on the one hand, and Debauchery and Immorality on the other; and labour more sincerely to discharge our Duty to God, our Neighbour, and our Selves, as the only Means to make us good Christians; and then we shall be sure to be good Subjects, and good Citizens; so as no longer to envy, despise, and rail at, or prosecute each other; but to love as Brethren, and to make Truth the badge of our Christian Profession. This is the only way to promote the Honour and Reputation of our Na∣tional Church, and the Religion established by Law among us; whose Foundation is not laid in Hypocrifie and aspiring Dominion, under a Dis∣guise of Religion, to delude and ensnare the Honest and Well-meaning to side with us, after the example of our Adversaries; whose Designs as they have been, so they still are, to undermine and subvert the Government. Therefore let us contermine them, in amendment of our lives, to credit this our Holy Religion; which needs no other Reformation, but that of Manners in its Members, according to its pure and wholesome Doctrine and Discipline; for which end, let us take for our Pilot, the Holy Spirit, (seeking its Conduct by constant Prayer;) and let us put on the whole Armour of God, and then we need not fear all the fiery Darts of the Devil, and all his Carnal Politicians warring in their most indefatigable industry against us.
