The second Part OF ENGLANDS New-Chaines DISCOVERED: Or a sad Representation of the uncertain and dangerous condition of the COMMON-WEALTH: DIRECTED To the Supreme Authority of England, the Representors of the People in Parliament assembled. By severall wel-affected persons inhabiting the City of London, Westminster, the Borough of Southwark, Hamblets, and places adjacent, presenters and approvers of the late large Petition of the Eleventh of September. 1648. And as it is avowed by Lievtenant Colonel John Lilburn, Mr. Richard Overton, and Mr. Tho-Prince, upon perill of their lives; and for which they are now committed to the Tower as Traytors. London, Printed in the Year, 1649.
To the Supreme Authority of ENGLAND, the Representors of the People, in Parliament Assembled. THE Sad Representation of the uncertain and dangerous Conditi∣on of the Common-wealth: By the Presenters and Approvers of the Large Petition of the 11. of September, 1648. IF our hearts were not over-charged with the sense of the pre∣sent miseries and approching dangers of the Nation, your smal regard to our late serious Apprehensions, would have kept us silent; but the misery, danger, and bondage threatned is so great, imminent, and apparent, that whilst we have breath, and are not violently restrained, we cannot but speak, and even cry aloud, until you hear us, or God be pleased otherwaies to relieve us. Nor should you in reason be with-held from considering what we present you withal, through any strangeness that appeareth there in; For what was more incredible, than that a Parliament trusted by the people to deliver them from all kinds of oppressi∣on, and who made so liberal effusion of their bloud, and waste, of their estates (upon pretense of doing thereof) should yet so soon as they were in power, oppress with the same kind of oppressions, which yet was true in the times of Hollis and Stapletons faction, and who, (as the King and Bishops had done before) laboured for an Army to back and perpetuate them therein. Nor were our Petitions then presented (wherein we justly com∣plained of those oppressions, and fore-warned them of the dan∣ger
ensuing) the less considerable for their burning them by the hand of the common hangman; Nor the Petitioners the more blame-worthy for being reproched with the names of Atheists, Hereticks, and seditious Sectaries (as now with Jesuite, and Le∣velier) Aspersions being the known marks of corrupt States-men, and usually working no other effect, but the discredit of the As∣persers. Yet were there then many who believed their reports of us, and they were as impatient with us, for our taxing them with their wicked and pernicious designs, as others are now for our presuming to detect them, who are so high in present power and repuration: But it is now evident, that it is possible for our Physitians to bring us into a more dangerous condition than they found us. And though experience hath made us wofully sensible, that no∣thing is more dangerous to any people than their bearing with unjust, covertous, or ambitions practises in those they trust; Yet did we forbear to interpose our judgements, or to oppose those mens designs, until they had made a large progress toward our bondage, and endeavoured to grasp the power of the Army into their hands, thereby to enforce their Tyrannie upon us; insomuch that it was almost too late to give check to their wicked intenti∣ons: so unwilling were we to believe it possible for men who all along pretended liberty and redress of grievances, to degenerate so soon into the grossest Principles and practises of long setled Tyrannies. And much more do our Consciences bear us witness of our backwardness to believe any evil intentions in those who not on∣ly were most vigorous and successful against the common enemy, but seemed so sensible of the injustice and trechery of that preva∣lent faction in Parliament, as to engage with the utmost of their might, as if they had really intended to deliver the Nation from that dangerous thraldom, so that we both durst, and did many of as, venture our lives upon their fidelity; Yea so powerful, perswa∣sive, and contentful were their first Engagements, Papers, and Remonstrances, to fraught with self-denying Doctrines, tender re∣gard to the peace of the Nation, and satisfaction to all interests; as even lulled all peaceable People into a sound sleep of security, ca∣sting all their care upon the General Councel of the Army, as up∣on a People they thought could never have the face to decline ei∣ther those principles, or to neglect the performance of so many en∣gagements,
promises, and protestations, made as in the presence of the all-seeing God, frequently calling upon him, the searcher of all hearts, to bear witness to their integrity and sincerity therein: Inso∣much that we (who alwaies with some warinesse observed them) many times denyed our own understandings rather than we would draw hasty conclusions from evident testimonies of their defection. But when after they had once sleighted the Agitators. and dis∣countenanced those Officers and Souldiers, who first engaged a∣gainst the destructive Votes of Parliament; such as stood firm to their engagements at New-market, and Triploe Heath: when we saw they not only neglected them, but adhered to persons sent from Parliament and City, in those corrupted times, and fell im∣mediately to plead for Negative Voyces in the King, and Lords; checking and controuling thse that opposed: When we under∣stood their General Councels (which according to their engage∣ments ought to have consisted only of two select Commission Officers, and two private Souldiers, chosen by every Regiment, with such General Officers as assented to the Engagement, and no other) were neverthelesse overgrown with Collonels, Lieut. Collonels, Majors, and others, not chosen; and many of them disseners from the said Engagement; and that some few emi∣nent persons presum'd above measure therein, and in effect over∣awed and controuled those Councels: and that the contrivance of a Counsel of State, was the great engine which those Councels la∣boured to bring about: when we found them not only to Court the King, by kissing his hand, and the like, and that a correspon∣dency was held between him and the General Officers, and A∣gents sent to and fro continually, whereby they came to so neer a close, as that their Proposals were not only received, but corrected and amended by the King, before they were sent to the House, till they became very consistent with his ends and Prerogative: and those Officers so engaged thereby, as to be moved to impatience towards any that spake a sillable against this their trafique and in∣tercourse with him: upon which likewise, they concluded an Agreement with the opposing Cittizens of London, without so muc as calling the Agitators to advize thereupon. Seeing, Hearing, and Vnderstanding these things, no marvel if we were staggered in our Beleese of their integrity. But that a person so deeply charged as the Earl of Manchester, and other grand slf-seekers of this House should be entertained with so great respect, and guarded to their places in Parliament,
and that notwithstanding the prevailing power of the Army, those who had usurped the Authority of the House, and Voted a new warre, were neverthelesse permitted to sit and Vote there, and that contrary to the importunate desires of the Agitators, and the Remonstrance of the Army: and then one of the first fruits of this their conjunction was the passing of an Ordinance for Tythes, upon trebble dammages, which the corrupt Clergy had presen∣ted (in the absence of the Speaker) to Pelhams Parliament; and the burning of Mr Biddles Book, by the Common Hangman; and imprisoning his person: and that notwithstanding their glorious March through London, the prerogative Prisoners in the Tower, New-gate, and else where, were utterly neglected, and the Councel of those friends sleighted, who had been instrumental, e∣ven to the losse of some, and the hazard of all their lives, to make an easie and unbloudy passage for the Army into Southwark and the City. Vpon observation of these and abundant more particu∣lars, which we could enumerate, we concluded, that the Councels of the Army were not steered as at their first engagement, by the select persons chosen thereunto, nor for the ends in that engage∣ment expressed; but by some other powerfull and; over-ruling in∣fluences, that intended other matters then were pretended, a d∣that laboured by all possible means to convert the honest endea∣vours of good men in the Army, and else-where, and the happy success God had blessed them withall, to the advantage of their Lusts, Pride, and Domination: And as time came on, it more and more appeared, that they intended meerly the establishment of themselves in power and greatnesse, without: any regard at all to the peformance of their promises and engagements, or any re∣spect to the faith and credit of the Army, or to the peace and pro∣sperity of the Common wealth, and that they walked by no rules or principles either of honesty or conscience; but (as meer polli∣titians, were governed altogether by accasion, and as they saw a possibility of making progress to their designs, which course of theirs they ever termed a waiting upon providence, that with co∣lour of Religion they might deceive the more securely. Now that this may appear no slander, we entreat that without partiality, their after proceedings may be throughly scan'd: as first, at Kingston it was proposed by the Agitators, friends of London, Southwark, and the places adjacent, that the Tower, City, and
Borough, might be secured by the well-affected Inhabitants, and not by Souldiers, that so trade and traffique might be preserved, which otherwise would be driven away (as it soon after proved) And that it was hoped they intended not to secure any place by Souldiers, when the wel-affected Inhabitants were able to secure it. Which advise proceeded as well from ourrespects to the City and neighbour places, as upon fears of what we know to be the pra∣ctise of other Tyrants (and therefore doubted would be exercised by those) namely, the garisoning great Towns, thereby to keep the people, as well in poverty, as in continual aw and subjection. Which advise, though assented unto by the Agitators, was yet re∣jected by the grand Officers, and a new Regiment raised, to the further charge of the Common-wealth; the Proposers themselves being dismissed with reproches, and the Agitators thrust out, and not permitted to observe how they were dealt withal. At which time also its very remarkable with how much height of State they observed the King at Hampton Court, visiting him themselves, and permiting thousands of people dayly to visit him, to kiss his hand, and to be healed by him, whereby his party in the City, and every where, were exceedingly animated, his Agents be∣ing as familiar at the head-quarters, as at the Court. Then on a sud∣den, when the House complyed not with their purposes, in all hast it was to be purged, and thereupon they publish a large Remon∣strance, Aug. 18. stuffed with publike reasons, to shew the justness and necessity thereof: but the House again complying, through the sight of their Remonstrance, though no whit changed in respect of its corruption; & they finding, if it were purged, it would not be for their design; they make nothing of their former resolution, but continue it in its corrupt condition, and sit with them themselves. Then they fall to work again about the King and send the pro∣positions of New-castle to him, which they knew, and were a∣greed he should not sign; in the mean time, they so wrought the King by deep promises, and hopes of restauration, as that  incli∣ned much to countenance the Army, gave out words in teir fa∣vour, and in his answer to the House, preferd their Propsals, be∣fore the Parliaments Propositions; in lieu thereof, the great ones of the Army themselves, endeavoured the revival of a Trey and some of them in the House, were very violent against  no more Address, and expressed it wa the sene of the  further Address should be made, and that except they
Addresses of another nature to the King, they could not promise them the assistance of the Army; and according they take pains to work every man at the head-quarters; upon which, petitions were attempted in the Army, in favour of a Treaty, and some con∣scientious, but weak people, were drawn to second their design, with a Petition for a Personal Treaty, which they had ready at the House dore. These strange and mysterious proceedings occasion'd a new face of things in the Army, many of the Officers being much distasted thereat, & whole Regiments chusing new Agents to look after the publike, as fearing things were runing head-long into a most dan∣gerous condition: The far greater number of the Officers, would not by any means indure to hear of the Armies complaince with the King, and the Agents finding all former engagements, promi∣ses, and declarations broken, and utterly neglected, and the Com∣mon wealth in danger of utter dissolution, produce an Agreement of the People, upon grounds of Common Right, for uniting of all un∣prejudiced people therein; the great Officers very much oppose it a while, as having set up another Interest: but seing the same take with the Army, profess though at present their judgements could not so far close with it as to act for it, yet they would never oppose it. Hereupon the whole frame of the design alters, and the matters in projection with them, were how to dis-ingage themselves, and be rid of the King, and how likewise to discountenance and keep un∣der the discerning party in the Army. In order to the first, they cast about how to get the King into the Isle of Wight, where they might both easier keep others from him, and the more entirely possess him themselves; and that he might with willingness be hurried thither, they work upon his fear; suggesting to him, that there was an intention in some violent persons to murder him, and perswade him to leave that in a letter, as the cause of his remove. To make which the more credible, they wrought L. Col. Hen. Lil∣burn to asperse his brother John (who then stood in the way of the great men of the Army) with a base & abhorrid resolution of being one that intended to murder the King; to the proof whereof they would never suffer the Asperser to be brought (though solicited thereunto by a Petition from divers well-affected persons) but in∣steed thereof, for that perfideous service, they advanced him to the government of Tinmouth Castle, above his brother Robert, where
retaining the leven of his Apostacy, which the Gen. Officers had laid in him, he ussered the deserved reward of a perfidious traytor. And though the General Officers enclined him to this revolt themselves, as well by their example, as by countenancing him in the beginning hereof; and though for the same he incurred the extreme displeasure of his Father, and Kindred, yet are both his Father and Kindred by the Officers themselves and their Associ∣ates aspersed with the fact, as if tainted with guilt and contammi∣nation thereof. Thus did they kill two birds with one stone, framing a Name for them which of all others is most distastefull to the People, and was therefore most likely to beget a beleef of the pretended assas∣sination. Where (by the way) we desire it may be observed, that not∣withstanding the word Leveller was framed and cast upon all those in the Army (or elsewhere) who are against any kind of Tyranny, whether in King, Parliament, Army, Councel of State, &c. And though it was not so much as beleeved to concern those upon whom they cast it, the inventers having often professed as much, yet have they both themselves and by their Instruments in∣dustriously propagated the same, and insinuated both this and o∣ther slanders of us into the hearts of all the easy and credulous people they could meet withall. But to returne, The King thus removed, they judge themselves at good leisure to deal with the Agreers for the People, and so suddainly violent they became in that work, that at the first Ran∣dezvous neer Ware, they shot a Souldier to death, for pursuing the ends of the Engagement at New-market, and for insisting upon the Agreement for the People: unworthily abused Major Skott, a Member of this House, sent him up a prisoner, and accused him and Col. Rains borough for appearing in behalf of the Agreement, and there withall sent Col. Ayres, Major Cobbet, Capt. Bray, and many others after them prisoners to Windsor, where, as Parties, Judges, and Juries, the Officers did what they would against them, sentencing some to deata, others to disgracefull punish∣ments, restraining and releasing at pleasure, and with as much Ar∣birrarinesse as ever was in the world, and could not be diswaded though Mr Saltmarsh and others bore full restimony against the cruelty and injustice thereof. Hereupon at the House they pro∣cured at once the imprisonment of five cordial Citizens, for justi∣fying
the Agreement of the People, and requiring Justice for the blood of the Souldier that was shot at Ware, disfranchized them, and under the notion of London Agents forbad their meetings. And when now they thought they had moulded and qualified the Army to their own bent, and had gratified their complying Offi∣cers, with the cruelty upon the Levellers, (for so they have stiled all who have manifested any sence of Common Right) and had found that they could be nothing so great, rich, and potent, upon a close with the King, and that it would be impossible for them to hold either Officer or Souldier firm to them, in case of such com∣posure. Hereupon uterly to frustrate his hopes that way, they pre∣vail with the House to Vote no more Addresses; and so vanisht away all their glorious flattery of the King and his Party, and their notorious dissimulation appeared, abusing thereby the Faith of the Army, and making it cleer to all discerning men, that such as could so break with one sort of men, will make no Conscience of keeping faith with any. Their next work was to new-mould the City, and make it theirs, for which purpose they brought some Regiments of Horse and Foot, to White Hall and the Muse, to the extreme discontent of the City, and provoke them further by keeping their Lord Mayor, and some of their Aldermen in the Tower, without ad∣mitting them to a Legal Tryal, though upon Petitions and ear∣nest Desires: at last they were referred to be tryed by the Lords, contrary to the known Law of the Land; but their jurisdiction being disclaimed, after a while they were released without any Tryal at all, their end being accomplisht, which was the terror of the City, and changing the Magistrates thereof, so as should best serve their designes. About this time also they began to exercise their Marshal pow∣er over persons not of the Army, and did sentence Mr William Thomson to death at White Hall. And then also they began to new moddel the Army, and for that end, (though the new raised Regiment for the Tower was thought no burthen, yet upon pre∣tence of easing the charge of the Common wealth, the Life-Guard must be disbanded, because consisting of discerning men, faithfull to their Country and former promises, and many others of like principles were pickt out of every Regiment; the designe being by weeding the choisest and best resolved men, to make the Army wholy mercenary, slavish, and the Executioners of a few mens lusts and lawlesse Pleasures.
All which those good men perceiving and resolving thereupon not to be disbanded, according to the Agreement at New market, till the ends therein expressed were fully gained, they were en∣forced there nto by Tyrannicall sentences of Imprsonment and Death (though the Officers themselves had formerly refused to disband upon command of Parliament upon the same grounds and strength of the same engagement:) By all which 'tis evident, that acording to the maxime of Polititions, they judge themselves loose, where other men are bound; and that all Obligations are to them Transitory and Ceremoniall, and that indeed every thing is good and just only, as it is conducting to their corrupt and ambitious Interests. And thus the most hopefull opportunity that ever England had for recovery of our Freedom, was spent and consumed, in such their uncertaine, staggeringmotions, and Arbitrary, irrational Proceedings, whereby all partyes became extreamly exasperated, as people that had been meerly mock'd and cheated by fair pro∣mises and under the most religious pretences &c. Hereby the Ar∣my, that but few momenths before, had been the joy and hope of all sorts of Rationall People, was made a by-word, a hissing, and a re∣proach to the whole Nation: insomuch that those (in hope of their large good Promises, and protest in their Declarations,) who thought nothing too precious for them, now grudged them bread, and were ready to stone them in all places where they came; Trade fled, Poverty increased, and dicontents abounded, till at length broke out such a flane, as no time had ever seen before; and no doubt, was the proper issue of such horrid delusions, mini∣string such matter for a generall Rising and Revels, as all former Policies could never attain to, and more threatning the ruine of the Nation then all the former forces and Stratagems of the Ene∣mies; and which is rightly to be imputed to the unjust, partiall and persidsous dealings of these men. But when they saw what a strange predicament they had brought themselves into, and which thye would never beleeve, till it was come upon them (no more then now they will) they had before manifested a greater Obstinacy, then now they did a serious Re∣pentance (which yet as the sequell proves, was but counierfeit) though (as God knoweth) we were overjoyed to beleeve it reall: Ac∣knowledging, with the greatest expressions of sorrow, that
they had walked by corrupt Pollitick Principles; That they had been to blame in Actings against honest men; That the name of Level∣ier, Jesuite or the like reproaches, should never be more heard amongst them, that if ever the Nation be happy, it must be by a conjunction in the Levellers Principles, calling upon all, to lay by all Discontents, to forget and forgive, and to unite all against the Common enemy, and promising with greatest asseverations, That if God, upon our joynt endeavors, should be pleased to deliver us out of this Sea of danger, that they would never divide from just Principles, nor in the least discouncenance honest men as they had done, nor endeavor to set up a party, but cast themselves upon an agreement of the People for the future settlement of the Peace of the Nation: but how and what performance they have made, that we shall intreat, may be impartially observed in the ensuing story; And for a full and timely proofe of their Relapse, & Discovery of their dissimilation; No sooner had they (through Gods blessing and the assistance of their reconciled friends) fini∣shed their worke at Colechester, but presently they call to question certaine Persons, that had appeared at St. Athanes in behalf of Captaine Reynald: chusing rather to forsake the Service, then to be commanded by Captaines, that had been violent against them, that had drunke the Kings Health upon their knees, and profest they could rather sight against the Levellers then Cavaliers, and these (according to their old wont) they sentenc'd to Death, and soon after releast them, as finding or supposing this kinde of Dis∣cipline most effectuall, to the breaking and debasing the spirits of the English. And because Col. Rainsborough had ever opposed their unjust Pro∣ceedings, they withdraw him from the Army, by a plausible, but onely a Tittular command at sea, where by the straitness of his Com∣mission; he not having thereby the command of the Shippes or Officers, he could neither restrain their Revolt, nor preserve himself from being expussed at the Seamans pleasure out of that employment. Then upon his return, the ruling Officers finding him as inflexi∣ble to their ends as formerly, they put him upon that dangerous and unhappy Service before Pomfre (notwithstanding a Com∣mander had been appointed thereunto by the Committee of Yorke) whether he went with much Reluctancy and discontent, as won∣dering
at the Cause of his being Design'd thither, and expressing as much to his Friends, his sad soul presaging the misfortune, which after befell him. But that which gives greatest cause of grief and suspect to his friends, is, that his Brother receives no furtherance, but rather, all discouragement that may be in searching after, and prosecu∣ting the causers of that so bloody and inhumane a Butchery. In the North, though during the Service and Necessities of the Army, the Levellers (as they are call'd) were countenanc'd, and taken into the Boosme, who thereupon (forgetting all former af∣fronts and disrespects) did liberally hazzard their lives, without suspition of fraud and delusion; Yet the Necessities being over; and the enemies subdued, they renew fresh disgraces, and fall into a greater , and contempt then ever. First, divers-Souldiers for Petitioning in the behalfe of Major Reynolds, that he might serve in the room of Major Huntington, were therefore rated, and threatned to have their skilles cutt, and some of them struck for so Petitioning; Major Iohn Cobit, who with the extreamest hazard had regain'd Tinmouth Castle, where his Superiour Commander had through the dangers thereof refused, was not withstanding rejected, and a Member of Parliament taken from his duty there, & contrary to the self denying Ordinance, made Governor thereof, Major White, who in all the desperate services in the North, had performed the duty of Lieutinant Colonel and Major both in the Ge∣neralls Regiment, yet because a constant man to his Promises and Prin∣ciples, was refused the Lieftenant Colonelship, and a man of a more complying Spirit fetch'd from another Regiment to officiate therein. And this was the usage not onely to these Gentlemen, but to all others whether Officers, or souldiers in North or South (for their Counsells were one in both) that did retaine a sense and Resolution to prosecute those good things intimated in their former Ingagements. And as before, upon their first great Successe against the City, when now again it justly was expected they should have made use of so notable and un∣expected Blessings to the benefit & advantage of the Common-wealth, (as their late repentances, promises and Pretences gave men cause to hope) the event proved, they intended another use thereof, for (having now subdued all their enemies, they proceed with greater confidence to their former purposes, of making themselves absolute masters over the Common-wealth, wherein there yet appeared one main obstacle, and that was an unanimous and uni∣versall Resolution in all Well-minded People (especially in that nu∣merous PEOPLE that concurred in the PETITION
of the Eleventh of September to center in an Agreement of the Peo∣ple, which if not evaded, it would be impossible for them) to goe through with their Worke: Hereupon againe they cry out for Union, and imploy their Agents, to get meetings, and Treaties with those that were most forward for an Agreement and contract with them to center in an Agreement, and that the matter of the Petition of the Eleventh of September (as was desired) should be the substance of that Agreement: there being no other way then by this yeelding in shew, to amaze this busie watchfull Party, and to keep them quiet, whilst they went on with other pieces of their worke. For what else hath all the time spent thereabouts produced, but a meere amusing, blinding and deluding all that cordially de∣sired the same, it being (before they left it) so obscur'd and per∣plext in the sense thereof, so short of what was intended, and so corrupted in many particulars, that those most loath'd it, that most desired it; In the meane time, whilst they had fixt good Mens eyes and thoughts upon that Worke, they secretly and swiftly prosecute their other Designes, as principall in their purposes, wherein questionlesse they had not had the Assistance of good men, but that it was verily beleeved in shew of driving on their owne Designe; they were really and cordially producing a perfect and complete Agreement of the People, as large both in grounds of dome, and redresse of grievances, as the petition of the E∣leventh of September, in the uttermost extent thereof did im∣port. Many of which Petitioners were not satisfyed but that such an Agreement of the People might then have been obtained without any of those extraordinary sudden and violent Courses lately ta∣ken, neither in bringing the Army to the City, breaking the House in pieces, or removing the King by such an extra-juditiall Procee∣dings & Court of Justice, as had no place in the English Govern∣ment; and did really foresee there would be nothing but abuse in their pretence of an Agreement of the people: and that their owne domination, in and by a Counsel of State, was the maine thing aimed at, and intended. The Removing the King, the taking away the House of Lords the over-awing the House, and reducing it to that passe, that it is become but the Channell, through which is conveyed all the De∣crees and Determinations of a private Counsell of some few Of∣ficers,
the erecting of their Court of Iustice, and their Counsell of State, The voting of the People the supreame Power, and this House the Supreame Authority: all these Particulars, (though ma∣ny of them in order to good ends, have been desired by Wel-affected People) are yet become (as they have managed them) of sole conducement to their ends, and Intents, either by removing such as stood in the way between them and the power, wealth or command of the Common-wealth; or by actually possessing and in∣vesting them in the same. And though all this was foreseen by us, yet so perswasive were their insinuations in the ears of many good and well-disposed Peo∣ple, both Souldiers and others, that they have been really carryed a∣way with belief of them, and reliance upon them, and have thought they could not better imploy their time and abilities, them in affording them all furtherance, and assistance that might be. So that their onely fears remain upon our Discoveries, to pre∣vent which, they use means, that either we might not have opportunity to lay open their Treacheries, and Hypocrisies, or not be beleeved if we did it. In order to the first, They strictly stop the Presse; In order to the second; They blast us with all the Scandalls, & false Reports their Witt or Malice could invent against us; and so monstrously wicked have they been in this particular, That they have pry'd into all our Actions, made use of all our Acquaintances, & friendly Intimacies, and in conclusion, have onely produced such Scandalls, as have been customarily used by former States-men, and such, when scan'd and examined, containe both contrariety in themselves, and have not the least ground of Truth, as concerning us. By these Arts are they new fastened in their Power, till ei∣ther by opposition from the enemy, which they may well expect God will raise against them, as the deserved Recompence of their vile Apostacy; or by the weight and Violence of their ma∣ny Injustices (which in the wicked course they are in) must every day be multiplyed, till they be thrown down from their usur∣ped greatnesse. They have already lost the Affections of all People, and are onely supported by their present strength; but when once those good men that hold them up, shall perceive how Instrument all they are made, contrary to their intentions, in advancing a few
losty and imperious mens designes; and how easy it is for them to convert their abilities & power to better, and more common ends ex∣prest in their former engagements, and which the complaints of the agrieved people, and their owne understandings can furnish them withall, they will then lament that they have so long been out of the way, and set themselves with the utmost courage & resolution to free their distressed Country from the fears and captivity it now groans under. They may talk of freedom, but what freedom indeed is there, so long as they stop the Presse, which is indeed, and hath been so accounted in all free Nations, the most essentiall part there∣of, imploying an Apostate Iudas for executioner therein, who hath been twice burnt in the hand, a wretched fellow, that even the Bishops and Star-chamber would have sham'd to own. What free∣dom is there left, when honest & worthy Souldiers are sentenc'd and enforc'd to ryde the horse with their faces reverst, and their swords broken overtheir heads for but Petitioning and presenting a Letter in justification of their Liberty therein: if this be not a new way of breaking the spirits of the English, which Strafford and Canterbury never dreampt of; we know no difference of things. A taste also of Liberty of Conscience they have given us in the Case of a worthy Member of your House; so as we may well judge what is like to follow, if their Reigne continue. And as for Peace, whilst the su∣pream Officers of the Army are supream in your House, in the Councel of State, and all in all in the generall Counsell of the Army, when the murtiall power is indeed supream to the Civill Authority, what Peace can be expected; we professe we see no councells tending to it, but hereof mighty and vast sums of money to be taxed upon the Peo∣ple per mensem, as if warre were become the only trade, or as if the people were bound to maintain Armyes whether they have trade or no; yea, whether they have bread or no. And as for the prosperity of the Nation; what one thing hath been done that tendeth to it? Nay, hath apy thing been done since they were in power? but what increaseth the rancor, hatred, and ma∣lice, which our late unhappy differences have begotten amongst us, as if they had placed their happiness and security in the totall devi∣sion of the People, nothing being offered by them, that hath any face of reconcitement in it, nothing of cheerfulnesse or generall satisfacti∣on, the mother of trade & plenty, that might take away the private remembrances and destinctions of partyes, nothing indeed, but what tendeth to implacable bitternesse of spirit, the mother of confusion penury, and beggery.
Nay what sense of the heavy burden of the people have they mani∣fested of late? hath it not been by their procurement that the Judges their Creatures have a thousand a yeer allow'd to every one of them above the ordinary fees, which were ever esteem'd a heavy op∣pression in themselves? is there any abridgement of the Charge, or length of time in triall of Causes? are they touch'd with the general burden of Tithes, that cankier of industry & Tillage? or with that of exize, which out of the bowels of labourers & poor people enriches the Userers, & other Catterpillars of the Comon-wealth: or what have they done to free trade from the intolerable burden of Customs, except the setting fresh hungry flies upon the old sores of the people? what one matterial thing did they offer unto you in their late Pe∣tition, which you gave them so many thanks for? terming their De∣sires modest & discreet; when it's evident by the contents, they did it only to stop the mouthes of their Souldiers, & to amuze them in∣to a pleasing dream, whilst they goe on in their Designe of absolute domination, & which should you in the least oppose, you would finde their modesty no more towards you, then towards your excluded Members: In the mean time, where is their Charge against those Members? or why finde they not who amongst them have conferr'd offices upon each other & upon their Creatures & relations? or who they were that gave so large Donations of thousands & hundreds per an. whilst the publick faith is broken, and Families are ready to starve for emptying themselves to serve the publick necessities; or why discountenance not they al those who have betrayed the trust of feoffes for Bishops & Delinquents lands & are purchasers them∣selves of great Estates for few yeers purchases, the due value right∣ly considered; or why blame they not the L. chief Iustice, and L. chief Baron for keeping their places, which were conferred on them (and the like on others) by this House, when those members sate there, they have excluded? or why finde they not out those perfidious per∣sous that have made no Conscience of breaking the self-denying Or∣dinance and persist therein? or is the reason visible why they have nothing to say against those sorts of men namely, because these are their own, and their creatures cases? Oh wretched England; that seeth, and yet suffereth such intollerable Masters. What can be ex∣pected from such Officers, who frequently manifest a thirst after the blood of such People, and Souldiers, as are most active for the com∣mon freedom, peace & prosperity of the Common wealth, & against whom they have nothing else to object: or what can be expected from such a counsell in the Army, as shall agree that the supream Au¦thority
should be moved to make a Law, That that Counsell of Of∣ficers may have power to hang all such Persons (though not of the Army) as they should judge, were disturbers of the Army. Certainly these things cannot but manifest unto you their very hearts, their inward purposes and Intentions representing visibly before you and all the World, the most dangerous condition, that ever yet this Nation hath been in: And if there be any Con∣science towards God or man to be found amongst you, the whol series & Progress of this our sad Representation is so fully known, and fresh in memory, that it is impossible, but it must work up∣upon all amongst you that are not Co-partners with them in their Designe, or are not ingaged (as the Lawyers are) in some corrupt Interest. But though this long betrayed and miserable Nation should prove so unhappy as that there should not be one found amongst you, to own these known Truths, which yet ring in every mans ears, throughout the Land; but through feare, or other vile re∣spects, should shut your eyes against the light: it shall be so farre from inducing us to repent of what we have herein (or in our late Apprehensions) expressed, and set before you, that we shall rejoyce above measure, that we have witnessed to the Trueth; and against all those Delusions and perfidious Stratagems lay'd by those men to betray and enslave the Common-wealth, to their owne Pride Ambition, Lusts, Covetousnesse, and Domi∣nation if not Dukeship, or Kingship; their Creatures discour∣sing of late, That the Power must be reduced to One: What their meaning is, time (if they be not hindred) will manifest: but the Premises duly weighed, doth evidence, what ere it be, it will be as bad, as bad possibly can be. And as we shall not altogether doubt of the appearance of some, in this Honorable House, that will conscionably performe that Supream Trust which is really and essentially resident in your integrity; what ever may be suggested to the contrary: (it being not others treachery, nor anyes violence, that can divest you of that Authority: but if you all should fayl therein, as God forbid yet we shall not doubt, but that what we have here pre∣sented, and published, will open the eyes, and raise the hearts of so considerable a number of the Souldiary and People in all places, and make them so sensible of the bondage and danger threatned, as that these men, this Faction of Officers, shall never be able to goe through with their wicked intentions.
It being an infinite shame that they should be suffered to pro∣ceed so farre therein, as they have done, there having beene no party hitherto so inexcusable for it is possible, if not probable∣that the King and his party might at first be induced to offend through error of breeding, long custome, and sway of times, (although that excuse neither him nor them) That Hollis, and that party, might at first be drawne into their violence, against people faithfull to the Common wealth through an erronious zeale against supposed Sectaries, and for uniformity in Presby∣tery (though that also but little extenuates their offence) but neither the one nor the other can be imagined to have trans∣gressed against so evident light. nor against so many and great obligations of love, and great respects from the people as this party hath done; So that the in entions, and endeavours of these men, to enslave the Common-wealth or their continuing of burthens, without any remorse at the dearnesse of food, and and utter losse of trade, exceeds in the nature and measure of it, all the wickednesse of both the other parties put together. And therefore upon due consideration of the premises, and in utter detestation of their most perfidious and treacherous dealing with the Army, Parliament and Common-wealth; we do in behalf of our selves and all wel-minded people, here be∣fore this Honourable House, as in the presence of Almighty God, protest against their breaking the saith of the Army with all parties, their dissolving the Councel of the Agitators, and usur∣ping a power of giving forth the sence of the Army to the Par∣liament and people also against the shooting of the Souldier to death at Ware, and their cruelties exercised on other persons, to the debasing of their spirits, and thereby new moulding of the Army to their owne designes, then playing fast and loose with the King and his party, till they brought a new and dange∣rous Warre upon the Nation. We also protest against their dissembled repentances, as in no measure satisfactory for so abominable offences: we also protest against all their late extraordinary Proceedings, in bringing the Army upon the City, (to the ruine of trade) there breaking the House in pieces without charging the Members particularly: And then judging and taking away of mens lives in an extraordinary way, as done for no other end, but to make way for their owne absolute domination: we also protest a∣gainst the Election and Establishment of those High-Courts of
Justice, as unjust in themselves, and of dangerous Presidence in time to come: as likewise against the Councell of State, and putting some of themselves therein contrary to their owne A∣greement: we also protest against all other the like meetings of those officers, that on Thursday the 22. of February last, vo∣ted for so bloody a Law, as to hang whom they should judge, disturbed the Army, (as having no power either by such Coun∣cels, either to give the sence of the Army, or to judge any Per∣son not of the Army, or to do any thing in reference to the Common-wealth, more then what any, so many fifty Souldiers or persons not of the Army have power and may lawfully do: though all the Generall officers were continually present:) these we protest against, as things unjust abominable and dangerous and declare that our present not seeking for Justice or reliefe therein, shall be no bar against us for the future, when we shall see cause to seek for Justice and reliefe therein. And for the truth of our Judgements herein: we should with gladnesse submit unto the determinations of this Honour∣able House, were not their High hand as yet held over you. And therefore we are enforced to appeale to a new Represen∣tive, equally chosen in such like manner, as is exprest in our seri∣ous apprehensions lately presented unto you, and do likewise desire that you would encourage the Army in chusing a Repre∣sentative, consisting of select Persons, chosen by every Regi∣ment of the Army, as at the first at New-market: and shall humbly pray that you will not any more receive the result of a few officers, as the sence of the Army: the officers of an Ar∣my having no more power to make Laws for an Army, then the officers of the Common Wealth to make Laws for the Peo∣ple; both of them being constituted only for the Discipline, and Government thereof. We hope you will proceed to further an Agreement of the People; according to our late desires in our serious Apprehensions, and also speedily take in hand and effect those other things therein desired, tending very much to the abrogation of the bondage intended. Thus have we once more unburdened our hearts before you, and faithfully discharged our duties to our Country, giving timely warning of the most dangerous thraldom and misery that ever threatned this much wasted Nati∣on, and much we doubt not, wil, by wisdom mixt with som honest resoluti∣ons, be timely prevented: which we shall exceedingly rejoyce to see, that so after so many yeers of sorrow, the people may at length be comforted, and the Land enjoy her rest; and that all the world may be enforced to confess, That There is a reward for the righteous, and that there is a God that judgeth the earth. FINIS.
