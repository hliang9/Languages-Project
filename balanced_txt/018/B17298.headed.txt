At the Pestle and Mortar, in Abchurch-Lane in Lombard-Street, you may have these following Medicines. A Remedy that Cures all Fevers in general, it never failing once in a Hundred in∣stances, and of all that have fallen under my Care, I do declare, I never had one but what Recovered, which I am sure no Practitioner in Physick, through∣out London, can say the like. It cures the most Malignant or Spotted Fever, in a short Time; they seldom keep Bed above four Days, intermitting Fevers or Agues, tho' of several Years continuance, viz. Quotidians, Tertians and Quartans, which Reme∣dy cures tho' (the Quartan or Fourth Day Ague is) called the Scandal of the Physician. For the Wind Colick in Bowels or Stomach, a Cordial Water which far exceeds all Medicines for pleasantness and prositableness; but if it is a Billious Colick, which you will know by this not curing, then I have Pills will effect the Cure. Papers of Powder for the Worms of all sorts, which brings away the Slime that breeds them, with the Bags they are sometimes inclos'd in. I shall give you a few Symptoms, by which you may know whether Old or Young are troubled with Worms, tho' the latter are seldom free. viz, Squeamishness, Vomitings, a Sower Breath, Tenesmus; a Swelling of the Belly, and sometimes a Dog Appetite, Dry Coughs, Shiverings, Fevers, these are a few Symptoms amongst a great many. Papers of Powders for the Green Sickness, or White Fever, (and all Obstructions) which if not taken care of in Time, very often ends in a Consumption. The Green Sickness or Obstructions, are sometimes occasioned by Worms, as I have Experimentally found, therefore not to be cured but by them that can cure the former effectually. The Head Ach frequently cured in six minutes, Swimmings, Diffiness in the Head, argies, and by making use of this Medicine infallibly prevents the Apoplexy.
