The Prophetie of the Spi∣rit of Loue. The first Chapiter. THIS is the  Sounde of the Voyce of the true Spirit of Loue: wher∣with the Lorde visiteth the Wickednes of the People vpon Earth / To thende yt it mought becom fulfilled, which the Lorde hath spokē through his holie Propheates. like-as ther standeth writen: The Lorde Esa. 26. c.
