THE COMMON-WEALTH's REMEMBRANCER FOR DISCOVERY OF THE Disturbers of her Peace. WITH A loving Reproof to such Offendors. AND A Caveat to others to beware of them. By a Friend to Peace, with Truth, and true Liberty, R. H. LONDON Printed for G. Calvert, and are to be sold at the Black-spread-Eagle, near the West end of Pauls, 1659.
The Common-Wealth's Remembrancer, for discovery of the Disturbers of her PEACE. FRiends and People, you have divers years been un∣der the Rod, chastised by the Almighty for a∣mendment, and many of you seen his Great and Marvellous Works done amongst you, even in the view of some that remain as Brands pluckt out of the Fire, and have need of Monitors to remember them of their Leader therein, and there-thorow, least matters of less moment cause him to slip out of their minds. But I am here chiefly (by way of Queries) to put you in re∣membrance how to consider of, and find out the Enemies of your Peace, Rights, and true Liberties, with their End there∣in, (as manifested by their Actions) yet onely so, as if it concer∣ned some other persons, (and not your selves) least you should be misguided thereby, and not rightly discern between per∣sons and things that differ, nor the Designs of such as lye in wait to deceive; wherein all plainness is (in love and a publike way) used for their Reproof, Repentance, and Amendment, and your Care and Caution to prevent the like for the future, when truly sensible of what is but in part past; and herein also take heed of being hasty to censure, least you miss of the Au∣thors meaning, and the benefit hereby intended you, and take offence before you know by whom the offence cometh, and what that is in you that is so offended; for Offences do come, and the Wo is to them by whom they come, not to him that in love mentions them for amendment and, caution to others therein concerned. Are not such to be considered who spend a great part of the yearly encrease of your Lands, Stock and Labours, (in rio∣tous living) as they can contrive to get it from you, either by force or fraud, to uphold themselves in Authority over your
Souls, Bodies and Estates, so as not to suffer you to come or go, buy or sell, dwell or abide in Peace, unless you give them what they ask, fall own and worship before them, and (at their pleasures) bea, e forth of your Meetings, stone, im∣pris, otherwise abuse persons that (for conscience sake towards God)   , but declare against them as evil doers, the great Enemies of Peace, Christs Righteousness, and your Souls, formery called Psons, Vcs, urates, Priests, Clarks, &c.  themselves Ministers, or Presby∣ters; but how like Ministers (, servants) divers of them have behaved themselves (towards God or man) in former times, Histories shew; and in atter times, your own Memories (even woful experience) may be to you a true Testimony; As∣suming to themselves the sad Title of Presbyter, with Autho∣rity to  and ordain others by laying their fleshly hands upon such other persons heads; and saying some inven∣ted forms or Words over them, all by a carnal Commandment at  Head of their Church cut off, the Root ex∣tirpate because bad and bitter? and are the Branches sweet, and the Fruit good Food for nourishment? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Now let all such as feel them∣selves truly touched and pinched by that of God in their con∣sciences, in their minds, and wait diligently on him that thee smiteth them and sheweth them their deeds of what sort they ae, and would cleanse them from all unrighteousness; but if such harden their hearts, and endeavour to excuse them∣selves by accusing others, then own Rod vvll be their ruine. The ensuing Queries (I suppose) concern not all alike, but some more, some less; some in many, and some but in few of the ensuing particulars, and so to be remembred and soberly considered, the Great Contrivances having alwayes been by a few leading Priests, and then afterwards carryed on by a more general Consent, Concurrance and Activity of others, with some contradicton amongst themselves, and that being pst, soon (like Herod and Pilate) they became friends to pe e the Righteous Seed and Son of God in his innocent and belo∣ved Lambs, their main business being to suppess the Power of godliness, and every thing of conscience contrary to their hu∣mane
Inventions and Constitutions, thereby to keep you in darksome ignorance, and a superstitious, awful reverence of persons, places and things, ever to take advantage against you, and put Chains and Fetters upon those that have the true zeal of God in some things above others, striving by all means to break that zeal, and bring under that Spirit in the Lords Servants (what ever it cost them) least they should (by that) be discovered and made manifest, and therefore ever seeking to keep under and out of Authority all such persons and men of sober, serious, and publike spirits, strict lives and manners, and to get preferred into Authority others of servile spirits, that have a mixture of ambition and vain glory, with other Vices fit to serve and support them and their Authority over men of tender consciences, and cause the faithful upright, and just, to be derided, scorned, abused and vilified, as in former and latter times is most manifest to all persons whose minds are not dark, troubled, and blinded by their deceivable inventi∣ons. 1. Whether the said men are taught by, and come to you in the Wisdom, Will, Power and Authority of God, or of man? And what Rule have they to walk by, save onely Interpreta∣tions, Inventions, Meanings, and Conclusions, raised and com∣posed (by themselves and others) as out of, and from the Scri∣ptures, to justifie their Doctrines, Precepts, Practices, and Con∣versations? And do they agree with the Servants of Christ, or one with another, (all speaking the same things?) Or are they not therein contrary, and one contrary to another, and different, according to the times, occasions, and respective Go∣vernments, one while praying, preaching, and contending for a Religion, Way or Tin, and at other times, otherwise, or a∣gainst the same, frequently intermedling with Affairs of Civil Government, and other mens private Concernments and Conditions, thereby occasioning strife and debate amongst you. Who, or what was it that confounded your understandings, disquieted your minds, and exasperated your spirits (so excee∣dingly) one against another in the beginning and continuance of these late Wars and Troubles, (the sad effects whereof you
yet in part feel) as to begin with those sports and pastimes whereof they had Books, which they generally read and pub∣lished in their Meeting-Houses, (called Churches) about the latter part of King James's his Reign, for Encouragement of Minstrels, Dancings, Revellings, May-Games, Stage-Plays, Morris-Dancers, and such like Exercises to be frequently per∣formed on the first Days of the Week, (called Sabbath Days) to the high dishonor of God, (whom they those days also would seem especially to Worship and serve) and grief of the persons then scornfully called Puritans, and others the sober minded amongst you, which then were by that means cruelly mocked, contemned, scorned, despitefully used and abused, because they ran not with others into the same excess of riot; and (those of you that remembers these things) consider who the prophane, the then irreligious and vicious persons did ap∣plaud and rejoice in, for publishing, encouraging, and joining with the said Exercises they then called lawful sports and pa∣stimes. 2. From whence, and by whose Ordination, Concurrence and Agreement (in the late Kings reign) were the then Altars? and by whose Practice, Example, and Commands, the frequent bowings thereto, and at such distinct distances and differnt manners, with other the Inventions and Actions then and there performed with so great zeal for their new high places, Rails, Garments, and other Innovations? And who were they that in those performances, and in visiting Crosses, Wells, and o∣ther places, in Preambulations, singing the Letany, &c. were adorned with Canonical Coats, Girdles, Surplices, Rockets, Tippits, Hoods, and the like, besides the great reverence said to be due to their persons, Office and Ministry, which (their Followers) were directed to manifest by distinct Bowings, stan∣dings up, and kneelings down before them, when, and as they pleased to teach, order, and command to be performed in their Meeting-Houses and elsewhere? 4. Who were they that (as the aforesaid services were in∣creased) flockt to London, Westminster, and Lambeth, to have their Wages also increased to ten Groats▪ or at least eight Groats out of each pound of every mans Lands, Stock, and
Labours, and a part of poor servants Wages, not then estee∣ming Tythes, Gebe-Land, and other their Offerings, Incombs, and several plurallities, a competent or sufficient maintenance; but they (being over hasty therein, and the time not judged seasonable) failed in that particular, and then what frequent Counsels and Consultations held those men in the several Countes and corners of the Land (under colour of Lectures, Emer-Week-asts, and otherwise) to consider of, consult, and find out snse other way for Augmentation to their Au∣thority and Maintenance? 4. Who were they that began and continued such, and so many vexations Suits in Law with their Patrons, Parishioners, and others, wherewith the Courts at Westminster, the Great Assizes in Counties, and other Inferior Courts were even pe∣stered (as Records may manifest) besides their frequent Suits and Summons before, and in the then Bishope Courts, some∣times for small Tythes, working upon some Popish Holy Days, (though but in repairing a Fence to save Corn, and preserve peace amongst Neighbours) for not gving them timely notice when Tythes were to be set forth to them; for going from some of them to hear in other Parishes; for Meetings (by them called Conventicles) or for not allowing Servants to join in the before mentioned sports and pastimes, and oft times obtai∣ning Excommunications therefore, and speedily turning them into Writs, and thereby causing mens bodies to be attached and imprisoned, whereby many consciencious persons were (in a manner necessitated to leave their dwellings, and this Land, to seek peaceable Habitations elsewhere, which divers of the said active persons made use of as an encouragement to their then design, some boasting thereof, and that they hoped to have another Authority before it were long, wherein their la∣bours have not been lacking, neither at their then High Com∣mission Court, nor other places, as hath notably appeared to all that have been willing to see it. Who served, assisted, and encouraged the late Bishops in ma∣king the Cannons, Liturgy, and Service-Book, (little differ∣ing from the Mass-Book) to be imposed upon Scotland, and preached against the Scots, (when that Book was refused by
them, endeavouring to make them, their Religion and practise seem odious, & their own (new-invented) Altar Worships, forms and bown, acceptable services to God, thereby then obtain∣ing a Declaration against the Scots, whereby (with great zeal) they proclaimed them Rebels; and after that a Form of Pray∣er against them, which divers of the said men as zealously read and seemed to pray in their said Meeting-houses. And who (after that) preached up an Army of Londoners and others, to enforce the said Book upou the Scots; and for the mainte∣nance of those Forces, did the like to have Ship-Mony paid by you; as also concerning Grants to Pattentees, and pleading for such and other Monopolies and Arbitrary Inventions, all oppressive to tender consciences? Besides the many Articles (the Bishops and they) then set forth, so numerous and contra∣dictory that they could not be performed by the Church-War∣dens (so called) whom they caused (or rather forced) to swear to present men by; nor could others find how to escape the Snares thereby laid for them. 6. Who, or what sort of men continued the Convocation-House ut Westminster about the year 1640. (after the then Par∣liament was dissolved) by a Commission obtained of the then King, (under the Name or Title of a Synod) and thereat made new Constitutions, Canons, &c. Armed with Censures, Deprivations, and Excommunications, whereat was the then new Oath made for establishing their usurpations, and to justi∣fie their Altar-Worships, Inventions and Innovations? And who of them there imposed that great Tax upon themselves in general, and on divers others, for the raising of more For∣ces (as an Additional-army) to go against the Scots, and procu∣red divers of their Creatures to go, and send forth men Hor∣ses and Arms, to carry on that their Design, all contrary to Law, and your Rights and Liberries, and (for the raising of those differences) so far prevailed, as to obtain the discoun∣tenancing and putting out of favour, trust and office in the Common-Wealth, divers of the most consciencious, sober, dis∣creet, and fit persons for those services, and thereupon procu∣ring others (that they knew would comply with them) to be setled in such Offices and Imployments, thereby uniting a sort
of the Nobility and Gentry to themselves, as also the generality of the prophane, ignorant & negligent professors; but these then call'd Puritans they found themselves unable to seduce. Have I need to remember you, or ask you concerning the charge of those Forces, what, or how many hundred thousand pounds was paid the said Scots afterwards, or who paid it; or of those other Mat∣ters of dangerous consequence, (by the said Convocation or Sy∣nod contrived) whereof all other sorts of persons (besides them∣selves) have sufficiently tasted? Or how they so continued act∣ing until the next Parliament call'd them to account, and punish∣ed some few of them, but the generallity escaped, and ever since have stood in the way of, and endeavoured to prevent all just pro∣ceedings tending to your Rights and Liberties? Was not your fire hereby kindled, unto which the Authors have ever since been ad∣ding Fuel of one kind or other, to this very day? Were they not of this sort of men that made Libels against the Parliament in the year 1642. imputing it as a crime that the King was not then believed, and those with him trusted, several ways charging them, and provoking the people to disobey that Authority, supposing to carry on their design by interrupting and preventing the Par∣liaments proceedings in order to your Rights and Liberties. 7. Who were they that seeing they could not be advanced by means of the Bishops, preached against, railed on, and earnestly endeavoured to have them supprest, (whom but little before they prayed for, as their Right Reverend Fathers) saying, The Bishops did them wrong by taking upon them as they did; that as Pres∣byters they (the said men) ought to have been authorized and called for to join in the choice and ordination of Ministers? Did it not thereupon generally ring in their Sermons, That Presbyte∣ry is the true Clergy, and the Church of Scotland a true Church; then contending for the Scots and Scottish Religion (which but a little before they cryed outagainst, and also proclaimed the Scots Rebels, and prayed against them) because that then seemed their hopeful way of rising into the like Authority as the Bishops had, each to be at least a Master, Bishop, or Presbyter in his Parish, and the chief men there, his Lay-Elders; and yet herein they did not then very well agree amongst themselves.
8. What sort of men, and who were they that divided them∣selves (as nncertain whether by the help of Rome or Scoeland, might be their readiest way of rising into Authority and Estates) into several Parties, and by Writing, Praying, Preaching, and pressing Arguments, perswading you to go forth from your dwellings, some to fight or the King, some for the Parliament, others taking all advantages in their Parish-Meetings, and else∣where, to stir up discontents and enmity in your spirits one a∣gainst another, thereby hasting you into a bloody and desperate War one party against another? And what was this for, but the obtaining of their ends by the first Way of Rome, or the other of Scotland? Either of which (it seemed) would have served their turns to maintain them (their Wives and Children in ease, pride and idleness) with Authority to punish all such as should presume to contradict them, or deny what they would have by way of tythes or otherwise, or impose any publike Charges on them: Thus prevailing with you to enlist your selves into two great Bo∣dyes or Armyes one against another, and by several inventions and execrations against those that were afraid or unfree to go forth in Arms to shed the blood of their Neighbours, Brethren, Fathers, &c. one party of the said men crying, Come forth, fight for God and your King, the Lords annointed, and the Protestant Religion; come forth willingly, you fear not God unless you serve and honor your King. The fearful shall have their portion in the Lake, &c. (said another party.) Come forth, fight for Christ, your Religion, Laws, and Liberties, &c. And a third party so on both sides by Preaching, Praying and Writing, as they stood affected, and as either Army came near their beings: I say, Was not this the means used? And who were those men that then took this way to beget and encrease your enmity and hatred one against ano∣ther, so between nearest Relations as is scarce to be found or na∣med amongst sober men, (such as some call Heathens, that have but natural affections) to the end that through these storms they might find out an easie way to their desired Haven, wherein to sport themselves, and rant it over other persons souls, bodies, and estates, and this all under colour and vizard of Religion, duty to God, and your good; so must the King (by some of these men) be perswaded to take Oaths and Protestations, and set forth De∣clarations
that all he did was for the Protestant Religion and your Liberties, thereby to strengthen his Party, and perswade you to believe it; and also perswaded him to seem to comply in se∣veral Treaties with the Parliament, even to the very last at the Isle of Wight, &c. Shall I need to ask, or remember you how a∣ctive some of these men were in plundering on each side, and en∣couraging Officers & Souldiers thereto, under pretence of weak∣ning that party they set themselves against? Or of the Contri∣vances, Means and Friends, many of them made use of to get in∣to each others Livings or Benefices (if greater then they had be∣fore) of some, thereby so entering into two or three such Bene∣fices? Or how divers of these men strove to give content to both Armies, to pray for, preach for, and sometimes give thanks on either side, as they come near the places of such mens resi∣dence, and either had prevailed in any storm or Victory, or did but say so: Were not some then so forward as to commend any killing of English men on the one side or other, for exrellent ser∣vice, and thereupon rejoice and give thanks (as they call'd it) in somuch that sometimes there hath been such Thanksgivings and Rejoicings on both sides for one and the same Victory? Or shall I need to remember you of their Railings, Revilings, and evil speakings against those they call'd Antinomians, Anabaptists, Ar∣minians, Sectaries, Schismaticks, Hereticks, &c. Or some of these mens petitioning against such sundry times, blowing the Coles on both sides the fire, as they got room, and still adding Fuel there∣to, for their design sake, when a fit opportunity might serve, the particulars whereof (when collected) may swell to a very great Volume; which Work (its like) may be by some other more dili∣gent observer thereof, their Ways and Deeds of darkness being not easily discerned, and therefore I mention some most obvious, least they should think them altogether buryed in oblivion, and continue impenitent, and you in security. Let me here add this also, (not to be forgotten) that the Parliament were necessitated for your, and their own safeties, rights, and liberties, to call up∣on you to enlist and maintain each other in a defensive way, when the late King had set up his Standard, and proclaimed a War in his own Land, amongst, and against his own Subjects, was not this the real difference between his Case, and their endeavours
for you; but how far that will justifie any the aforesaid mens de∣signs, I leave to you to consider of, and them to the light of Christ in the conscience, &c. Which of these parties of this sort of men are your Ministers of Christ? Or did he or his Ministers at any time so seek to destroy mens lives? 9. When many of the aforesaid sort of men saw they were not like to obtain their desires by the King in the way of Rome, What Art, Industry, and Diligence did they use in their next de∣sign to have the help of their said Brethren of Scotland, which they saw could not be plausibly carried on and established to their Wills without some consultations about it, and therefore would needs have it by an Assembly of themselves, which they called a Synod or Assembly of Divines, scarce taking rest until they were so owned, (though called together upon their entreaties, only to offer their humble Advice to the Parliament) and how Authori∣tatively did they then act, (as if they had been again in Convo∣cation as, and with Bishops) and as if no man were to doubt of their Determinations, or question their contrivances, some Wri∣ting, and others speaking as in Acts 15. that it might be said of their proceedings, It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to them, to order, direct, &c. so that every man should receive rules from them in all things pertaining to the Worship and Service of God: But he that sits in Heaven laughs them to scorn. It is (also) like many of you may remember what great hast they then made to have their Decrees established accordingly, and bow they took their opportunities for it, when divers Members of Parliament were imployed in the Countrey and Army, their favourites (for the most part) being then in the House, thereby to settle them∣selves so, as to be able (with assistance of their Lay-Elders they would chuse) sufficiently to Master, and deal with all Sectaries and other persons that should prove refractory, or any way dis∣obedient to them or their Decrees, either by their Parochial; Classical, Provincial, or National Inquisition, or High Commis∣sion Courts. 10. Is it here requisite to be remembred what Charge that Synod was to you at 4. s. per. diem each man, and large Benefices, besides the Allowances given to some of them by the Committee they obtained, called, The Committee for plundered Miisters, when
few of them were plundered; and in case some one of many did lose that way, he must be speedily and sufficiently repair∣ed out of your moneys, or else that would serve for a railing Theme, to fill up divers of their Hour-Sermons. Are not these persons the now great Plunderers in all parts of the Com∣mon-Wealth, forcibly taking (and causing to be taken) away mens Corn, Cattel, and other Goods, what, and when they please, under colour of their Office and Ministry, and never∣theless now prevailed to have their said Committee revived as for plundered Ministers, whiles thousands of poor, (whereof divers have been plundered, and remain without any relief) not onely vvant Bread, but Imployments vvhereby to la∣bour for the relieving of themselves, Wives and Children. But what at last did the said Assembly or Synod bring forth but a National Covenant, a Chatechize, and a dead Directory for the living God to be worshipped by, with their establishing themselves as rightly ordained before by the Bishops, and a new Way, Method, and Manner of ordaining others, wherein their Brother Calamy led them to begin with seven young men in his Meeting-house at Aldermanbury in London, for an intro∣duction into that new devised Way and Worship, (wherein the Lord God is not so mock'd, however they deceive themselves and others:) but as for any Benefit, Commodity, or Advan∣tage unto you concerning your souls or bodies, that seemed not their business; neither would they willingly then (nor since) suffer other persons to do their duties therein, and deal plainly with you concerning your souls, (when they could or can prevent it) lest they should thereby lose their praise with men, their Fame, & fat Benefices; for they wel know that when you shall withdraw your breath from them, they presently wither, dye, and become as empty Idols, so that all men will then see whereof they are made; but while you put into their mouths, (what they would have) fit your selves in gay and gaudy Apparel, and so fall down and worship before them, own them (because of their Book-Learning) to be the onely persons to speak to you from God, and to God for you, give your Honors, Wisdoms, Wealth and strength (that the Lord
God hath given you for his service) to them for the service of their lusts, (and excessive pride of their Wives and Children) and pay all Military Taxes and other-like Charges for them; and they have the Gleab-Lands, Tythes, Stocks, Estates and Incombs (they get from you) altogether free to maintain them in ease and idleness, (without working with their hands (the thing that is good) and eating their own Bread) when many of the poor amongst you (labouring and toiling hard) must pay Contributions and Taxes over and above what may, or can be well spared from the thin backs, and hungery bellies of their Wives and Children; I say, While you thus do, no won∣der if you continue in blindness, errors, aud ignorance, with∣out the knowledge of God (to your shame) and neither see, nor desire to be free from these afflictions they bring upon you, which on you are just that so uphold and maintain the Enemies of Christ, of your own souls, and the Nations peace. Need I yet further remember you how some of them have strugled for, and got Augmentations to their former Benefi∣ces? How divers also have got fifty pounds each man to carry them for Ireland, and when there 100. l. or 200. l. by the year, and some more for preaching, or rather deceiving that people with their lying Inventions, and causing punishments to be inflicted upon those that shall therein contradict them, where∣by it is evident that whosoever hath gained by these times of Trouble, they have not lost theereby, nor their favourites fai∣led them therein, though it is, or may be clearly seen, that far greater things have been expected by them. 11. You may not forget the said Solemn League and Cove∣nant, nor need I further tel you who brought forth that birth, and gave it that Name, as also sometimes calling it the Oath of God, and National Covenant, (as their Brethren of Scot∣land had) but so cunningly contrived of ambiguous Words and Terms, to answer all the Authors ends, as no Antinomian, Independen, Anabaptist, Seeker, or other Sectary (by them so called) or person (in any kind or sort differing from them) might find a way to escape out of their net, with full confi∣dence also that they (the said Authors) should be the onely Interpretors thereof, whereby they might turn the sence and
meaning, any way at any time, or on any occasion to serve their turns, and teach their younger Brethren to doe the like, assuring themselves that none they call'd Lay persons ought or would presume to interpret or give the Meaning of any part of so Excellent a Piece of their workmanship; and then how high∣ly did they extoll that new Idol (their Covenant) and preach'd it up, as a thing so absolutely necessary that none ought to refuse it, remaining as restless untill they had prevailed with most of the Members of Parliament to lift up their hands to it, and subscribe it, and therewith got the stamp of Authority upon it, That all men in the Nation should be called, to lift up their hands to the most high God, before that Covenant, and swear &c, and then how was the sound of that solemn League and Covenant in every mans ears (of Cities, Town, Countrey and Army) by the ma∣kers thereof, and their younger Brethren riding and running from place to place, from one part of the Army to another, in all hast to surprise men thereby, eagerly pressing, and earnestly perswading men speedily to take that solemn Oath; and many that could not be so brought under their yoke must be enforced thereto, some by losse of Estates or liberty, others by losse of their Places, Offices and Imployments, and all refusers thereof stiled Malignants and enemies to the Common Wealth (though many such refusers were then with their Swords and lives as in their hands for the Parliament and your Liberties) whereby di∣vers of your friends and faithfull servants were displaced and re∣jected as Offenders, and then under this Cloak and Mask (of na∣ming the most high God and that Covenant) all other their in∣ventions must be sheltered, ushered in, and carried on, and the greatest part of their Sermons be of the excellency of your so en∣tering into Covenant (as they said) with God, and of the bene∣fits thereby accruing to them that so did, and the danger of re∣fusing such an opportunity so to do; and this being thus carried on to the height, in the next place they could tell you how the Oath of God was upon you, how you had lifted up your hands to God, and of the great Danger of breaking Covenant with him, with their then new sense and Meaning thereof (according to the then occasion) to be observed upon the highest penalties, although it may be boldly asserted, and let that of God in every
mans Conscience answer him, whether themselves that made it (taking them severally and jointly) or any other persons (that took it) then did, or yet do understand it, so as to say positively, this and no other is the meaning of any one of the six branches thereof, the interpretations thereupon may be, and are so parti∣cularly various: Neither is it to be supposed that the Contrivers thereof ever intended it should be understood by any man, but that all should admire it, and be satisfied with their respective meanings thereupon, however differing therein, not onely one from another at one and the same time, but on all occasions u∣sing the same as a Ladder to climb up into Authority over your souls, bodies and estates, (more generally and Tyrannically then the later Bishops exercised) could they have gotten up to their intended height. And were not some of these the men that stirred up discontents in the Citizens of London against divers faithfull men there intrusted with the Militia, perswading that none were fit to have to do with the Militia in that City, that were then of the Parliaments Army (they call'd Sectaries) or disaffected to the ends of their said Covenant, holding forth this Covenant to make way for them in all their Designs, new Ca∣nons, Constitutions, Directorie, &c. whereby their Congre∣gationall, Classicall, Provinciall and Nationall Courts were to take their Rise, and be established to enslave and vex you with continuall suits and attendance from one of their said Courts to another, and all under the specious pretence of Religion, Rules and Ordinances for the worship and service of God, and good of his Church? 12. When the faithfull servants of the Common-Wealth (in the Army and elsewhere) were discouraged, and divers of them displaced (as aforesaid) where, or what sort of men procured also the bringing into these places many loose, prophane, and disor∣derly persons that could complie, take Oaths and Covenants as directed? And were not the Parliaments then three Armies thereby spee∣dily brought into a kind of Confusion amongst themselves, and rendred unfit for your service, and on the other hand the King not onely became Master of the considerable Garrisons, but also of the field it selfe and was it not (even then) many of these
mens great cry: that God was against the Armies▪ and they pros∣pered not, because their Covenant was not generally taken, and strictly observed, and that the Government of the Church was not established (as they advised and directed) whereupon the Parli∣ament was necessitated to take notice of the approaching danger to themselves & (you the Lord in mercy directing) then drew forth of those three Armies one intire Army, and therein again imploy∣ed these faithfull and valiant men (that before were so put forth) and others like faithfull persons were therewith joined, and uni∣ted hearts and hands together, under their then truly noble, faithfull and self denying Generall, their Lieutenant Generall, and Major Generall, and other like Officers, and obedient valiant Soldiers, to the great and generall dissatisfaction of those Cove∣nant Makers; yet still they presse to have their Covenant enfor∣ced upon that Army also, as knowing no other way to break it, and that at such time when (under God) the very safety and externall welfare of this Common-wealth lay at the stake upon that Armies Proceedings, and here none else to stand in the gap, &c. and when some of the said Covenant-Makers (and others of that sort) had by their endeavours (as was then said) pre∣vailed with the Scots Officers and other old Souldiers to with∣draw themselves from, and leave that Army, as designed for de∣struction, (whereof the Lord of Hosts was pleased to make an∣other manner of use contrary to their expectations) and when that Design took not, how shamelesly did divers of those men rail against, revile and asperse that Army, labouring by all means to bring an Odium upon it, by false Reports and slanders; and who were they that then prevailed with the said Scottish Offi∣cers and others to wait in London and Westminster untill they should see the destruction of that Army they call'd the inconsi∣derable number of Rawheads new Noddle, &c. whom (said some) the Kings Party will soon make an end of, and then the said Officers would be sought to, might make their own conditions, & be imploy'd according to their desires. What should I say more of the railing accusations then brought against that Army they called Sectaries, prophesying the ruine of the whole, &c. in case these men were continued in Arms, thereby to weaken all hands
in the time of the Parliaments greatest weakness, how many of these troubles, did manifest their grief and sorow of heart when they understood the King prevailed not against that army (they called sectaries) at Naseby fight; (much taken notice of, in, and about the said Cities at that time,) whereby it is evident that these (of that sort of men) with the King, and others from him, were then indifferently agreed any way to do their own business, as hath appeared since, to your sorrow, sad sufferings, and loss. 13. Who were they that held correspondence one with ano∣ther, and employed spyes in all parts of the land under colour of getting intelligence of errours and heresies, held (as they said) by some Officers and others of that Army, which one called Dr. Edwards (a Priest then in London did especially manage; and what strange things had they thereby invented to charge that Army with, and which were then put into print in severall books (one after another) by the said Edwards, called his Gan∣greens, stuft with Mistakes, forged inventions, and filthy lies, stil pressing their Covenant to prevent Errours and Heresies, as they said, and labouring with the Parliament for an Ordinance to in∣hibit privat Meetings, (they called Conventicles, as the late Bi∣shops had done) which they had oft before sought for, when the former Armies were at a distance from London and they sup∣posed the time seasonable, but as oft prevented by some consi∣derable losses in the Army or forces, when in any measure the Parliament incline to such persons therein. And who (about the same time) stirred up those called the Clubmen in many parts of the Land (and some priests with them) under colour of defending themselves, and estates from plun∣derers, even when this sort of men saw the Parliament like to prevail, and their ends not accomplished? 14. Whose designe was it to have the late King carried to the Scots, when the whole Nation was even brought (almost) into obedience of the Parliament, and great hopes of a speedy settle∣ment (As supposing themselves sure that way to make their own market by and with him?) and who were they that so earnestly perswaded to have the said Army speedily Disbanded, (when the King was bought and brought, back againe from the Scots,
and nothing else seemed to stand in their way) perswading there was then noe need of that Army, and noe way would serve to Disband it, but by troops & companies, apart one from another, before due satisfaction given them, or any satisfaction of them in what they had done, or any the Rights and liberties, (for which so much blood had been spilt, and Treasure spent) so much as ascertained, much lesse setled and established, unto you and them, arguing that the great Taxes might then be much a∣bated, bloody Ireland relieved by these that should after be en∣listed under other Commanders for that Service; some souldiers goe back to their former imployments, and others (of their chusing) be imployed here by this meanes to have broken all in pieces, and set one party against another, rather then to fail of their intendments, further pleading how dangerous it was to continue that army, or to send them together for Ireland under their own Officers, how soon they would so conquer Ireland, and fill that land with sectaries, and then how should they be dealt with here at that armies return, when their doctrine should like∣wise further spread over England; some saying (though they could not but confess that God had manifestly appeared in, and by them, and they had done great services) they were not to be con∣tinued, and therfore nothing could satisfie but such a disbanding as might disperse, & discourage them &c. whereupon some officers of the said Army, and souldiers, having notice of the design, the designers prevalency, and evil consequences thereof to the whole Nation, advised together how to draw up a Petition to their then General for satisfaction in a few particulars, whereof some of the said persons got intelligence, and without any cer∣taine knowledge what the said Officers intended to Petition for, first had an Order got to suppress the said Petition, and there∣upon a Theme to preach of, and cry out of dangerous principles in the Army, and designs to oppose the covenant, labouring to have the Petitioners censured as enemies to the State; and how then, and by whom did the slanderous libels and Pamphlets fly a∣broad, divers Officers of the Army imprisoned, and after released without being told the cause of their commitment; and when (in much mercie to this Nation) they were prevented therein, how did some prevaile with divers Londoners to prepare a Remon∣strance
against the army, and then stirred up Refarmado Officers and others, to enlist men, and there got up another Army, and prevaild so far as to have the Militia there taken out of the hands of faithful men, and put into other hands to carry on their de∣signe by heading forces against the Army, and set on foot a new war which might have proved more bloody, and terrible, then that before; but the Lord of all the earth pleased to turn their counsels (like that of Achitophels) into foolishness, and direct the Army (in obedience to the Parliament) to do their duties sober∣ly, so as that (in a mild way of prevention) things were brought back into their former condition of peace, and the said Militia a∣gaine into safe hands. 15. Who in the next place procured the said Reformado Of∣ficers, (whereof some had been disbanded, some cashiered, and some served the King,) with divers Londoners to force the Parli∣ament to pass several votes, &c. which was so great a breach up∣on the priviledges of Parliament, as that the Speakers and mem∣bers of both the then houses were necessitated to repaire to their said Army for safety, and when returned (at their then next free sitting to recal these votes so by these pastwhile under that force, and also dispersed these Offisers (so made use of to put that force upon them) but the many Contrivers & Abettors escaped, though much then spoken of, because of the State of affairs at that time; but rested they here? or did they not rather wait for other opper∣tunities wherein the Lord by his wise providence prevented them sundry times? yet for all this they were not willing to see his hand stretched out against them, and turn to him, neither do they yet seem willing: now all you that in any measure are turned into the light, brought into the fear of the Lord, and did see his mercy and marvelous works in these times, forget not all his benefits, his deliverances (in your low estates) from intended deaths, when that Army was so despised and railed on (by scorners that oft sought their lives to take them away) low and weak in their own esteem, then did the Lord strengthen and put courage into his ser∣vants that truly trusted in him, and believed his salvation, cleaving unto him, and one to another with all their hearts; Yea truly then blessed were they, while many others before mentioned were exercised in cursing them, and sorrowing at their safeties, and
successes, and when the Lord enabled ten to chase hundred, and a hundred to put a 1000. to flight, for that was the Lords doing, & marvelous in the eyes of many beholders, being in order to the great war (manifestly begun) between Michael and his Angels, and the Dragon and his Angels, in this day of God almighty, to the terror and amazemen of all enemies that would not Christ should reign over them, but stand in the enmity, equally fearing, and hating the goodniss, wisdome, and mighty power pf God in his sons and daughters. 16. Who, and what men were they that in the heat and height of these Military affaires, aud taxes upon you, were so restless, un∣til they obtained an ordinance for tythes, (with trebble damages, or value for non-payment) fo far prevailing, that those who had not wherewith to pay should be imprisoned &c. he that re∣members these things need not be farther advertised of that sort of mens practices, or prevalency that could obtaine such an or∣dinance (never before heard of) at such a time, in such a manner, and only upon their bare words, that tithes are due to them, that they are the Ministers of Christ, or that tithes are ordained by him for their maintenance, &c. being a task they never could, nor now (by Scriptures) dare take upon them to prove, but they can tell you one while that they are due to them by Divine right, another while by some authority of man (though noe act of man makes them due; but supposing them due did order the setting forth thereof) that their predecessors received tythes of their parishoners for many generations; that tythes are not now to be questioned; that several Parliaments have Judged them due, & ordered payment accordingly; that the Israelites paid tythes by special command from God, and would you (now under the Gospel) pay less to Christs ministers? that Gleab lands and tythes are their free-holds &c. while all is but deceit and covetousness; for they have no colour to demand any thing, but as Officers or servants for performing service, and that from the Persons they serve, and during such respective times as allowed, and therein continued; but as for Christs work or wages, they neither know the one, nor will be contented with the other. 17. Who were they that encouraged the raising of forces in London, and the adjacent counties, as also in Wales, and other
parts, and that then took and caused Oaths to be taken (with him they call'd Lord Capel, and other Officers for the King) and gave their assistance therewith against the Parliament accor∣dingly, and about the same time held correspondency with them of the Kirk, or Clergy of Scotland, whereupon an Army of Scots were raised and came (under command of Duke Ham∣bleton) to join with others here, and invade this Land, hast∣ing so far towards London, as Stafford-shire, before the Parlia∣ments Forces could meet with them by the then directions given therein; and what, or who occasioned the long dispute between the Nobility and said Kirk of Scotland, whether should appoint a Commander in chief of that Army, some of that sort of men here being not ashamed to say, that Duke Hambleton died a Mar∣tyr? (It is is like they meant for that intended service) and who were they that deluded the late King by their Sermons, and other∣wise seem to accomplish, but not to consent to severall things proposed to him by the Parliament; some telling him it stood not with his honor as a King, so to yield to his Parliament; asking him whether he would make himself a Subject, &c. and at other times so craftily acting and advising between both (for their own ends) untill he was thereby brought to his last gasp? and who in like manner lull'd asleep, and misled the Parliament severall times, untill, &c? And who since have prevailed with, and misled their late Great Benefactor and Protector, and those with him, untill he also fell? and so shall all such Builders of Babylon, and up∣holders of her Merchants, even they that help, and they that are holpen, shall speedily fall together. 18. Who were they that preached up the aforesaid Covenant in opposition to the Engagement, To be true and faithfull to the Common-Wealth, as established, without a King or house of Lords) both in the year 1648. and 1649. &c? Who sent Letters and books into the English Army (when going against the Scots) to discourage and divide them, and thereby to disable that Army and prevent their Proceedings, and all whose charge, pains, and diligence was that correspondency held between the Presbyters in England, and Scoland, in and about the yea 1650 & 1651, and who so generally then preach'd up the Scots religion, Church-go∣vernment, Worship and discipline, here in England, and likewise in
Ireland, and all the time the Kirk of Scotland were carrying on their Design with harls Stuart, whom they afterwards crown∣ed there, and (then with all their might) hasted to bring him in∣to his late Fathers Throne (by way of Conquest) with that po∣tent Army of Scots, and others here prepared to assist therein; and how sad and unquiet were this sort of men (in all the three Nations) upon the defeating and routing of the said Army at Worcester? and who were here the chief Actors therein, that sent intelligence and timely notice of the fittest season and way of that Armies so coming for which some (of the most notorious) were called to account, and (its like) one or two suffered, but the generality of them remain the same to this day, as they can find out opportnities in like manner to act for their own ends, whether by such correspondency with any like men in Holland, or else where? And who caused the Turkish Alcaron to be Printed in English after the Parliament inhibited the so Printing thereof and to what end, and who are the men subject to changes, and alter and change those they call Religions (in all ages) when, and as they see it may be most pleasing to Kings, Queens, or Rulers, and profitable to themselves, and augment their Autho∣rity over the bodies and Estates of others, and (upon such chan∣ges) Preach that for the Word of God, and true Gospel, which seems to lead to their preferments, by taking best with such Au∣thority; and in Authorities greatest weakness, and Distempers to take advantages over and against it, as who is able to make men∣tion of the many factious Sermons in the times of your late troubles preached before authority, for which (they were so cunning therein) they rendred thanks, seldom reproofs; but have they not often thereby hindered businesse of importance, because not suitable to their intentions? 19 Who were they of the Presbiters Kirk of Scotland that acted and contrived their Intendments so mysteriously during all the time of Englands troubles, bookingin all interests with their like Brethren here, as also in Ireland, Hell and Hagu, and o∣ther parts for the carrying on of their designs; Their railing accusations and slanders, so oft raised against the English Army while here; As also, when at Glascoe, or other parts of Scotland,
their occasioning the poor people there to hide their goods in the earth, and their bodies also, by perswading them that the English Army of Sectaries would kill them, and take what they had; the said sort of men exalting themselves against the Civil Authority there in matters of the greatest moment: their rai∣sing of Forces, giving Commssions in the name of the Kirk and Kingdome, their inviting young Charls Stuart to them, putting him to take their Covenant upon his own Constructions, and then Crowning him to strengthen their Party and Cause: their disagreements amongst themselves about him and his, and other∣wise their seeking assistance from France; their treacherery against the English Army by their Kirk Army at Dunbar, and other parts, &c. yet could they not have much harmed or troubled you (what ever they intended) had not many of their said like Bre∣thren here fomented Differences and assisted them for the more easie accomplishment of their Kirk-Design in a generall way. 20. To passe by the Popish Clergy (so called) in Ireland, with the cruel Murthers, and bloody Massacres by their instigations committed in that Land, during that late, horrid Rebellion, Call to mind and remember who they were, that (about the tenth year of the late King before the said Rebellion brake forth) as∣sembled in Dublin, Composed an Instrument, and thereby rai∣sed a Subsidy, called a free Subsidy of four shillings out of each pound of all their promotions and Spirituall Livings (so called) in order to a War, that had such an inordinate desire to bear Rule, and exercise Authority, thereby to maintain and support their new sound Altar-Worships, Bowings and other their then then Inventions, their frequent Disturbances by medling with matters of Civil Government, so by writing, preaching, and o∣therwise, of what they liked or disliked in Magistrates or others, the severall Inventions and Designings in the time of the said Rebellion, the solemn Oath many took and preached up, and which many of the people there did take in the latter end of the year 1648. to be true and faithfull to him they called their young King Charls the second, how they would fight for him, assist him, &c. Who were they that before and about that time, Preached for, extolled and encouraged, those they called their Excel∣lent and Right Honourable Lords (Ormond and Inchequin) to
make Leagues and Cessations, and joyn in amity with the said Popish Priests, and Irish Rebels, and that about the same time in 1648. Composed and set forth in Print certain Prayers (so call'd) for their said young King, and therein such execrations and expressions against the said Parliament and their Armies, as I find not freedome here to name, then and in these times frequently read in their Congregations; and yet since how forward and prevalent have some been in preferring their friends and favou∣rites (severall that assessed them in those their former actings) into imployments of publick trust, by having divers faithfull ser∣vants of the Common-Wealth, put out of such imployments to make room for them, and because of not complying to do such unfit things, as some of that sort of men desired, whereby Justice hath been turned into wormwood and gall, and of such persons (so brought into Authority) have they severall times prevailed (by letters, preaching, and otherwise) to have men chosen as Members to serve in Parliaments, there also to carry on their Designs. Not to say much how the said sort of men have been enabled to do such things by their large Salaries, or how frequently divers of them have caused the Publick Peace to be broken by the rude people, in and near their Meeting-houses, in beating, stoning, and abusing sober persons that did but tell (or offer to tell) them plainly of their Deceits and lying inventi∣ons (in love and for amendment) that the people might cease from these that so beguile unstable Souls; the time being come that Christ Jesus will have all spirits to bow and bend to his spi∣rit, which is, if they were acquainted with, they would not one∣ly favourably resent, but lovingly entertain such discoveries and Counsels as tend to their own, and the peoples knowledge of him, of whom many have as yet got but a sound of words, not know∣ing whereof they affirm. 1. Ob. But divers of the before mentioned men would not have so taught, encouraged, or done the things they did in the Bishops dayes, but that they were then under the Bishops Com∣mands, and liable to their Censures, so that they durst not dis∣obey them, lest they should be silenced and lose their Benefices, whereby themselves, Wives, and Children might have come to want, and they ought to provide for their Families; he denies
the faith, and is worse then an Infidel, which doth not that, and the like may be said in the beginning and time of the Wars, some of them dwelling under the Kings Power, and others where the Parliament had power, and likewise where both Armies came upon occasions; and further, that their affections led them, some to encourage and assist the one side and the other as they could have opportunities, &c. which I take to be their strongest Reasons; for I suppose none of them will now say, their Altar-Worships were done for Conscience sake, much lesse will they say, they so laboured to set men to kill one another for Consci∣ence sake, or thereby to exalt themselves into greater Authority and Estates, and therefore briefly answer. An. It was Christs meat and drink to do the will of his Father, (who came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them) and his love in all his Ministers constrains them to be obedient to him, and labour even so to walk as he walked, in all things seeking the good of others that they might be saved, but never did, taught, or allowed the doing of such things as these in any Nation, or amongst any people upon any accouunt whatsoever, much lesse for a worldly maintenance, Wives, Children, or like affections to any man or thing; and they that are such lovers of their own selves, fear outward wants, or so please men, cannot be the servants of Christ, his Ministers were never such, and therefore let no man deceive you so any more with vain words—Besides this, who, or what enforced any such men so to preach or incite men to Wars on the one side, or on the other? or who occasioned such sidings, making Parties, and causing en∣mity in each against other? surely this Parliament did it not, for that it was begun some years before they sate; besides they were necessitated to make use of all means and helps they had or could conveniently have for their own and your safeties, and preservations, when the then King would not be perswaded to Peace, but raised a War (by means of many of these men) in his own Land, with and against his own Subjects; and yet where, or when did the Parliament so much as imprison any of these men, because they would not preach in their names for Wars, provi∣ded they sate quiet, and medled not against them. 2. Ob. But the Priests or Ministers are not to be blamed in
such cases, because what they do, is for the good of the peoples Souls, to have them of an uniform Religion, whereby to pre∣vent Sects, Schismes, Heresies, and all sorts of Divisions amongst hem, wherein the Magistratate is to take the said mens Advice, and they to assist and help the Magistrate therein, they being so usefull in Government for support of Authority, that all would fall into confusion without them, it being their duties to satisfie mens Consciences, that all Governments are of God, and to di∣rect their minds to Obedience and Subjection to every Ordi∣nance of man in every change of Government, and Gover∣nours, and to help therein by inciting to Wars or otherwise, as they shall see occasion. An. Instead of doing good to your Souls or bodies, have they not done the contrary on all occasions, pretending to be Christs Ministers, to Preach the Gospel of Peace, when they stirred up strife, and prepared for War, and in stead of assisting in Government; been the disquieters of mens minds, disturbers of publick Peace, hinderers of Rulers in the making and due ex∣ecution of Righteous Laws; have not this sort of men been the causers of Sects, Schismes, Heresies and Divisions, and the means whereby Governours and Governments have been changed, (with great hazard, charge and trouble to you) when not suit∣able to their dispositions and intentions? and is not this their compliance with, and pretending to assist Magistrates, and do good to peoples Souls, their great Engine of Deceit, whereby they invent and contrive your Troubles, and carry on their sub∣til and crafty Designs, under specious pretences, solemn for∣malities and ceremonies without spirit or life? Now let the wise in heart judge who in Authority or otherwise have received any good by them or their Counsels; and whence else should your troubles have had their Rise, the King have so raised his Army, or came by his Fall as he did, and (others in) somewhat a different manner) before and since? and contrarily, what peace and con∣cord was in the Parliaments faithfull and unanimous Army (in scorn called New Noddle) when this sort of men had least to do therein, & most imployed themselves in railings thereat? Doth the Lord God change? or do changes in Governours or Govern∣ments alter his mind, or the way of his Worship and Service? or
is his fear truly taught by the Precepts of men, or are his Ministers subject to changes, as Governments change? from Popery to Prelacy, from Prelacy again to Popery, to Protestanisme, Pres∣bytery, Independency, &c. hurrying people (as it were) head∣long, sometimes one way, and sometimes another, thereby dri∣ving all as into confusion, and causing such to become sad suffer∣ers that follow them not therein. Consider whether these will be sufficient Arguments to justifie before the Lord Jesus Christ at his appearing in his glory and pure power to render to every man according to his Deeds; it is most manifest, that Christs Mi∣nisters would have rather suffered, (and do willingly suffer at this day) the spoiling of their goods, imprisonments, and bodily death, rather then yield to any such vile affections in themselves or others. Consider also who enforced any of this sort of men, or what necessitated them to become such violent persecutors of consciencious men by the names of Puritans, Precisians, Separatists non-Conformists, Brownists, Anabaptists, Seekers, Quakers, &c. to commence and prosecute such and so many vexatious suits against their Patrons, Parishioners, and others, to hast so earnestly in∣to each others livings, and turning Wives and children forth of doors, to get augmentations unto their former Benefices, to run from a lesse, to a greater Benefice, to seek and take Pluralities, to intrap men by Oaths and Covenants; to revile and speak evil of persons in Authority, to force mens goods from them with∣out consideration, or such contract made with them, or such mens owning them in their deceitfull practices, to cause such and so many disturbances in the Nations, or to become so Na∣bal-like, that a man may not speak to them; what Rules or di∣rections, are to be found in Scriptures (which they say is their Rule) for these things, &c? The restraining of this sort of men, from making disturban∣ces by medling with State matters, or otherwise; from a forci∣ble taking of mens goods (that for Conscience sake) disapprove of their practises, and leaving the said men in equal condition with others, to prove their Doctrines by their deeds, according-to the Scriptures, as also clearly ascertaining your other Rights and Liberties, and securing you therein, might be a safe, spee∣dy,
and honourable way of proceeding in the cure of the yet unhealed wounds, Ruptures and distempers of this Common-Wealth. And now to your Omen herein (about others) concerned, con∣sider soberly of your respective wayes and workings to accom∣plish your own ends, what your aims are, and how evilly you have required the Lord God and this people of these Nations for all the good things done for you, your Wives, and Chil∣dren; for I deal plainly with you in love to your souls and bodies, and desire to manifest that I have no hatred to any mans person, nor can be free to let sin lie upon your souls, but put you and others in mind of your former miscarriages, and reprove you soberly, as the onely Lord God (the righteous Judge of all the earth) hath commanded me, who is now shaking, not the earth onely, but the heavens also, that the things which cannot be shaken, may remain; wherefore deal plainly, truly and faith∣fully with him and your souls, be willing at last to hearken to the voice of Christ in his true light in your Consciences; bring all your deeds to that light, which never did, doth, or can de∣ceive you in any thing, but (as diligent heed is taken thereto) will shew you plainly all your deeds (done in your mortall bo∣dies) of what sort they have been, and are, with all your most secret thoughts thereupon, and intentions therein, with what you should do, and what you ought not to do; for that would bring you to true Repentance not to be repented of, teach you to walk honestly, as in the day, to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, &c. Hear∣ken to that voice of the wel-beloved Son, and wait for his ap∣pearance, that he may hearken unto you, and receive you graci∣ously, before the doore of Mercy be shut against you, sorrow, shame, and sadnesse overtake you, and so seise upon you, that you find no place for repentance, though you may seek it dili∣gently with tears; for there is such a day of black and thick darknesse hasting upon many evil doers that harden their hearts against Christ, and would not he should reign over them, though that of him in all Consciences shews how to come to him, and learn of him who was lowly, and meek, holy, and harmlesse, which is your duties in an especiall manner, lest (after so many
his warnings) he leaves you to your hardnesse and hearts lusts, and say, why should they be smitten any more; they are tur∣ned to Idols, let them alone; and then you justifie your selves, and Act yet greater and greater abomination, in fighting a∣gainst God, stirring up strife amongst the people, and belying the Lords Servants, his truth and true Church, that is, with∣out spot, blemish, wrinckle, or any such thing; and what will you do in the end thereof? There hath been a time of igno∣rance which the Lord God hath seemed to wink at, but now calls upon all men every where to repent and believe in his onely begotten Sonne, whose Gospel never came in word onely, but in plain demonstration of his spirit and of power; nor doth the faith of Gods Elect stand (at all) in the Wisdome of man, but in the pure power of God; as Abraham believed God, and followed him, not knowing whither he went, so do they that are of the same faith, (Children of Abraham) at this day, being led by his spirit, and fitted with wisdome and great Power for his spi∣rituall work in this his notable day, wherein his Angels appear spirits, and his true Ministers a flame of fire in all Lands, thereby reproving the world of sin, righteousness and judgement, gather∣ing the Wheat into his Garner, and burning the chaffe with un∣quenchable fire; even his day wherein the armies of heaven follow him, crushing down, and breaking in pieces every high thought, lofty look, and deceitfull thing, that exalteth it self against the Kingdome of Christ, and cannot worship you, nor any Idols that you set up (be they never so fair or well-favoured) but (as Christs sheep) should greatly rejoice to hear his voice in any of you; but your strange voice they may not hear, nor can own your Pharisaicall holinesse, your mock-fasts for strife and debate; your railing accusations, cursing those that came in the name of the Lord, or other abominable practices, which you exercise your selves in (without any respect or Reverence to truth) be∣cause contrary to what is strained through your muddy brains, wherewith you have so defiled the Nations, that the workers of iniquity have no more knowledge, but to run violently (at your becks) upon the Lords people, to devour them as a man would eat bread, to condemn and kill the just that resist not, even the
able Ministers of the new Testament, not of the Letter, but of the spirit (though some otherwise unlearned men) whereby they approve themselves to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, in Afflictions, Tumults, Stripes, Imprisonments, La∣bours, &c. Do not your hearts smart within you in thinking on the dolefull and deadly Knes you have rung, and caused others to ring over this Common-Wealth, and yet do, ever seeking to put the people upon Acts of violence one against another, there∣by taking peace from the earth, under colour of advising some to take heed of being deceived by others? when that of God in your Consciences will tell you that it is by your Inventions they are deceived, that you do or say therein, being not for very love to God and their souls, but for other ends then his Service; and how instead of being a sweet savour to God, as also in them that believe, and to them that perish you are become an evil sa∣vour, and stinch upon the face of the earth, in so much that it is sore burthened with you; and can you be so blind, as not to see it, or not to think it high time for you to live quietly, as sober minded men, work with your hands, and eat your own bread, and permit others to do so likewise, or the Magistrate to prevent such Acts of violence, as many of you have, and yet do occasi∣on, that those who have not yielded obedience to the light and Law within, are to be governed by a Law without, and they that observe the Royall Law, and live of the Gospel, freely (in all places) to preach the Gospel. Would you have all people to believe, that as you buy Lear∣ning, Languages and Arts for money at Schools, that so (there∣with also) you receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and after that (having laid your hands one upon another, and are placed in Parishes) what you have, or shall find out, invent and com∣pose, as from books, and so take mony to tell of, or teach o∣thers, is the Word of God to them for salvation of their souls? or would you have it believed that you have any rule for what you do and teach, save onely your own, or other mens meanings and interpretations of the Words and Writings of the Prophets, Christ, and his Disciples, as recorded in the Scriptures, which you make use of as the chief instrument of your Trade or Craft, to get mony by, therewith beguiling unstable Souls, that can∣not
cease from Sinne; I pray you consider what else doth it avail you to Read, Hear, Study, Invent, Compose, and con∣tend about words, while you abide in the Enmity against God, and Wrathfulnesse of the Earthly Nature, Will and Wisdome, even of that spirit which led Gain to slay his brother (Because his own deeds were evil, and his brothers good) the Jews to crucifie Christ, and stone Stephen, and all the bloody persecutors (in the Antichristian state) to torment? slay, burn and massacre the bo∣dies of all the Martyrs, and that onely for the word of God, the testimony of Jesus; and those persecutors not being able to resist the wisdome of the Holy Spirit by which they spake, it be∣ing the very same spirit in you that hath occasioned some of you to cause such and so many vile things to be done, as would make a mans ears even tingle to hear tell of, which is the cause why you are generally in so great confusion, so ignorant of your du∣ties to God and man, and of the people that are the Worlds Scorn, that bear the vessels and name of the Lord at this day; and why you conclude your selves and others are to continue in your sins, be of an erroneous and fallible spirit, while in these Bodies of flesh, &c. Must you indeed contiuue in sinne, remain sinners of the Gentiles, or worse, for (as it is written) He that commits sinne is of the Devil; whhile so, what ground, Rule or Reason have you to suppose people should believe you, or hearken to your Talk, or Methodicall Forms of words, more then unto others? can that be good and pleasing to God that is mixt with sin, and per∣formed by sinners, that take part with the evil one, Gods ene∣my. Doth any unclean thing come near his dwelling? or did not Christ Jesus come to destroy the works of the Devil, and bring in an eversasting Rrighteousnesse? Be not alwayes slow of heart to believe what is written; these your inventions shall cer∣tainly and speedily come to an end; Babylon shall fall and never rise again; and therefore come out of her, make hast, tarry not, nor say within your selves, Shall we confesse our ignorance of what we have so long laboured about, preached and contend∣ded for, as the Gospel of Christ, and for which we have received so great yearly Incomes from the people? Shall we bring so great a shame upon our selves, our Office and Ministry, as to
say, we have been so long deceived, and deluded and deceived so many peoples Souls that trusted to us and ou Doctrine; and thereby occasion every one to sleight, contemn, and despise us. Must we lose all, part with all, or not be Christs Disciples? Learn to labour, and live like other men; This is an hard saying, who can bear it? &c. Now at your perils be it, whether you hear or forbear, you have been plainly dealt with; and if for all this, you remain obstinate, not willing to become fools for Christs sake, that you may become wise unto him; not willing to set aside all your ornaments of Learning, Arts, and naturall part, and stand sin∣gle unto him, that he may know what to do to you for your good, but will indeed have your portions in this present evil world, you shall not onely have leannesse in your Souls, but these things (wherein you take delight, and which your hearts lust after) shall be dead comforts, but living torments to you, and your blood be upon your own heads; when Christ shall say, Depart from me, I knew you not, ye are workers of iniquity: Go to the gods that you have served, and to the men and things that you have trusted in, &c. And now, all you people, I say again, hearken to the voice of Christ in your Consciences, wait, and watch there, that you may come to see how far you have been guilty against God, and occasioners of your own troubles, and sufferings, as evil-doers; for it is written, that God moved David to number the people, because he had a purpose to destroy them, even so were the able men amongst you numbred before the late Wars; and when so, God will find out instruments, though such may be imployed by the evil one to their own ruine. These things before mentioned, were not all done in a corner, nor you remembred thereof to disquiet your minds, or to raise displeasure in you against any person, but as afore is said for their admonition, and your satis∣faction, and future caution, wherein take diligent heed at all times, and stand clear of these men; for you may be like to meet with tentations, such as you are not yet aware of; here is the true cause of your troubles and trialls, for you to make the right use of, and as any of you become diligent observers of your duty, to God, you will discern things rightly, savour the things
God, and fee them as they are, and use them as you ought, and then shall no man need to say to such, Depart from the Tents and Ware-houses of such wicked men, or enter not into the Idols Temples, lest you defile the Temple of God; For if any man desile the Temple of God, him will God destroy. There is now no serving two Masters, no partaking of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devils: Stand therefore in the daily Crosse unto that, and in that, which is contrary to mans own will, desires, affections, Reasonings, and words of Wisdome, and so abide faithfull unto him that hath so called, who will also do it, &c. but then look to be made a by-word amongst others, a derision to them that are round about you, and it is also like the Devil may cast some of you into Prison, and tribulation you may have, which (according to the integrity of your hearts, and cleannesse of your hand) shall be to your spirituall advanta∣ges, whereby to become wiser then your enemies, as continual∣ly refreshed and strengthened in the inner man, by the ever∣springing fountain of Life and love that runs through the earth, to accomplish that for which it is sent, which many of you yet see not, because your eyes are shut; Christ Jesus came to open the blind eyes, and right blessed are their eyes that see, and receive the inheritance amongst them that are sanctified through faith in him, though derided, falsely accused, and set at naught (as the good way of the Lord, his service and servants have been and are) cruelly persecuted & said to be troubles (as Elijah was) even by many of those men that oft have, and yet do strive to trouble and overtop the whole Common-wealth, as others (of that sort of men) before them, though in somewhat a different manner, &c. Have not some such men done more mischief in a few weeks or dayes, then could be amended in much longer time (besides your sad sufferings thereby) by causing (as it were) the foundations of the earth to be turned out of course, occasioning changes in Governments and Governours? and is it not evident, that they who can so far prevail, as to have set up again, and pulled down? (at their pleasures) can also throw the same down again (by like means) when that serves not their ends, whereof not onely histo¦ries, but your own experience, do (in part) make manifest and dis∣cover? by whom, and in what way confusions of mens minds and
manners, changes of Religion, Laws, and states, as also was, spilling the blood of the Saints, and other miseries to mankind, have come in all ages of Antichrist. Some speaking in your cases, will say that the late Bishops were an inconsiderable number of men, had not many more assisted, and led on others also, as the multitude, to act and carry on their Designs; And as for the late King, he was but one person, and therefore his evil Councel and assistants were all along chief∣ly charged rather then he; and will also say, that you (the peo∣ple) desired peace (rather then War) and a quiet living, untill incited, stirred up and provoked to strife, and Intestine Wars, one part against another; and therefore certainly there be yet some men justly to be esteemed great offenders therein, the guiltiness of whose cause and Consciences cannot be separated, and yet have so (fox like) lurked in their dens vnder the shelter of one Authority after another, as that they have escaped the hand of Justice, and not been dealt with, if discovered, although at some times crying out against Authority, and at other times to autho∣rity to help them and defend them from but being soberly spo∣ken to: It is not here said, what such men deserved, or do de∣serve for all these their sundry sorts of services (when particu∣larly discovered with their respective deeds) nor what is become of the Magistrates, that hitherto have taken such for their Coun∣sellours, and patronized them. These are things that the righ∣teous Judge of all the earth will yet further call to account, who hath looked down from the habitation of his holiness and glory, and taken his peoples cause into his own hands, and ap∣pears therein, with affection to them, (as being afflicted in all their afflictions) and indignation against his enemies, who (if they so continue but a little while shall become like Bell and the Dra∣gon, Empty Idols, (seem they now never so great in this world) so that all others sh see whereof they are made; for the Lord God of Glory will speedily read down Sathan under the feet of his Saints that art dear and precious in his sight, what ever others deem of them.
