THE True Light Discovered to all who desire to Walk in the Day. In several little TREATISES Written by that faithful Member of the true Church of Christ Jesus (lately deceased) STEPHEN SMITH. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the Light of the World; he that followeth me, shall not walk in dark∣ness, but shall have the Light of Life. John 8.12. LONDON, Printed in the Year 1679.
To the Friends of Truth in the Counties of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire. Friends, HOw greatly hath the Lord appea∣red in this day, in raising up many Instruments to sound forth his glorious Truth? yet many are not sen∣sible of it, nor of the great Work he is a doing, who is a setting up his Spiritual Kingdom, and is establishing Righteous∣ness in the Earth; and all those that op∣pose this Work, shall in im be ashamed, and the Lord will go on with his Work, who is come to restore Man into the pri∣mitive purity he was first created in: Man that hath been drove from him into the Earth, by reason of Transgressions, and been a Servant to sin, and under the power of Satan, and been ignorant of the Life of God, and of the sweet refreshments of his living presence, not knowing the
motions and leadings of the Father, nei∣ther hath his ear been open to hear the voice of God, but hath been without any sensible feeling of the Life and Power of God, and had no savour of the things of God. In this condition is Man, that is drove from God in the Fall: But now is the Lord come to restore him again by his beloved Son Christ Jesus, who re∣deems Man again from his lost estate, and brings him out of the Earth, and out of all such things which had sepa∣rated him from God, to delight in the Lord his Maker again; and from being a Servant of sin, to be a Servant of God, and of Righteousness and Holiness, and to bring him again into Innocency, in which he was first created. And this hath been the Work of the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, in all that did receive him, and it is his Work at this day. The Father of Mercy and great Com∣passion, he hath considered Mankind who had corrupted his way, and he sent his Messengers to foretell the coming of the acceptable day of the Lord, and the day of Salvation of God, who invited all the
hungry and thirsty to come and drink at the Fountain of Life. And this was the free Love of God, to help Man out of the Pit wherein there was no Water, and to offer him the Wells of Salvation to drink at, that so he might be washed from sin and from pollution into which he was fallen, and could see no deliverer, till the Lord was pleased to open a door of Hope, and to set him free by his Son Christ Je∣sus, and to save that which was lost, and to bring Peace and Salvation; whose power is indeed as able to cleanse from sin, as ever the Devils was to defile and corrupt. This is true, and witnessed by some, though many cannot believe that ever any can be free from sin in this life. Now he that is in the first birth, and sees no further, but is overcome with sin daily, and his mind is earthly and corrupt, and has never known the power of God to work in him the New birth, and a change from his sinful Estate, he judges he can be no otherwise while he is here, and so is like a blind man, who though the Sun shines, because he cannot see it, he will not believe that it shines, or that others see it.
But this must not make the Faith of some void, who have known the second Adam to be a quickning Spirit, and have found him able to save to the utmost all that come unto God by him; and the bloud of Christ is to them of full effect, and they witness him to be a perfect Saviour: and indeed for this end was Christ given of the Father, and for this end came he into the World, and was made manifest, to de∣stroy the works of the Devil, and to save his People from their sins; and until Christ hath brought Man out of the Trans∣gression he hath fallen into, he hath not finished the Work that the Father hath given him to do; for as sin hath reigned unto death, so must Righteousness reign unto Life Eternal; and as through the power of Lust man hath been defiled throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, so by the power of Christ is man to be sancti∣fied throughout in Body, Soul, and Spi∣rit; and being once cleansed by his power, to be saved from those sins which formerly have defiled him: and by this Man doth witness the Restoration by Christ, and the renewing by the Holy
Ghost into the Image of God again, which he had lost whilst in the Transgression; and so Man comes again into unity with God, and to know his voice, his motions, and the leadings of his Holy Spirit, which while he was in darkness, and served sin, he was wholly ignorant of. This makes Man fruitful again unto God, who before was as a barren Wilder∣ness; and whereas he was before filled with Darkness, he now comes to be filled with Light and Life, and now he hath Visions and Revelations of Heavenly things: before he was crying, There was no Revelation nor Vision, they are ceased; whilst night was upon him he saw no Vision, and because he saw no Vision, nor had no answer from God, therefore he thought it was so with all others, and that Revelation and Vision was ceased; and he measured all men by his dark rule, darkness being over him, and his eye blinded. Whilst he was in the first birth he was Earthly, his mind Earthly, delighting in Earthly things; he could not then believe there was any immediate Teachings of
the Father by his Holy Spirit, nor any en∣joyment of Heavenly things; neither was his eye inward, but to an outward Tea∣cher, and outward Books and Writings; but when the inward ear came to be opened, and the day of the Lord appea∣red unto him, then he heard the words of God, and saw the Visions of the Almighty, and then he began to praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his mercies which endure for ever. And now being come to taste of the loving kindness of the Lord, and his heart being filled with Heavenly blessings, he ministers forth the same to others; and these are the true Ministers indeed, who are moved by this blessed power of God to seek the Salvation of Souls: And of this number was our dear Brother Stephen Smith, (now deceased) a man who laboured in faithfulness and constan∣cy, according to the ability God had given him, to beget others to the Truth; and was constant in Sufferings, in Tra∣vels and Labours, and had a good esteem in the hearts of many for his faithfulness to the Lord, as you well know, and there∣fore
I need not write much concerning him, especially since some others have written so largely of him, but shall re∣main, Your Friend and Brother in the Everlasting Truth, Ellis Hookes. London 28th. day, 3 mo. 1679.
A Testimony of the Work and Mercy of God, particularly in relation to our dear Friend Stephen Smith lately deceased. THe most holy and wise God, who hath been pleased to make choice of foolish, weak and contemptible things, to cond the wise, and the things that are mighty, to the intent that no flesh (with its wisdom and strength) might glory in his presence, but that his Power might appear in what way, manner, or Instru∣ment soever he pleaseth, how mean and despicable soever they may seem to that fleshly eye and mind that takes its measures from outward appearances, and not from an inward solid principle of sound Judgment: I certifie from a living experience, that this most holy God hath appeared and raised up many Witnesses of his blessed Power and Work in our day; even persons of va∣rious degrees, qualities and capacities, not only some few endowed with
Learning, natural acquirements and parts, but more especially many of the plain, simple and unlearned, to the end that not only his Power might the more appear, and shine in its glory over all flesh and the glory of man, but also that God in his wisdom is gra∣ciously pleased to condescend to the lowest and meanest capacities, in most familiar ways, to direct his speech and Testimony of Life for the reaching peoples several capacities and consci∣ences, so as to turn them to that prin∣ciple of Light and Truth, which through Christ Jesus he has placed in them: God hath in our day, as in for∣mer ages, raised up Plowmen, Herds∣men, Fishermen, Husbandmen, and such like, to be experimental and more effectual Preachers to men of such ca∣pacities, then Academical or School∣men with all their Learning, acquired parts, and School craft; and with a plain Testimony in the simplicity of the Gospel, condescended to accommodate and answer low and mean capacities, with that truth and simplicity that is in
Christ Jesus, which has been to the con∣founding of the wisdom of the wise; so that it may be truly said, where is the wise? where is the Scribe? where is the disputer of this World? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this World? and not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to con∣found the wise. And although the fol∣lowing Writings and Discourses of this our dear and honest-hearted Friend Stephen Smith, now deceased and at rest with the Lord, do not bespeak him a man educated in artificial Learning, Oratory and Eloquence, yet he was a simple, plain-hearted and sincere man, to what the Lord made manifest in him, and one that eyed the power and presence of God in his Life and Testi∣mony, since the God of all our mercies was graciously pleased to open his un∣derstanding, with the knowledge of his Divine Light and Truth, as it is in Christ Jesus our Lord; he prized it as his great mercy from the most gracious
God, that after his long and wearisom travels in many Countries, and exer∣cises in the troublesom and tossing Sea of the World, he at length arrived at his desired Haven of safety, being brought to know a true stay to his mind, and a quiet habitation of repose in the Sanctuary and holy Tabernacle of him who dwells in the Light, and hath Immortality dwelling in the Light. I knew this man from the first time of his being convinced and receiving Gods holy Truth, (which was in the year 1665.) who in mercy to him made me instrumental therein; and when his understanding and heart was opened, through the plain evidence and Testi∣mony of the Spirit of Life, concurring with the witness, manifestation and operation thereof in his own consci∣ence, (as it always doth) he received the Truth in the Love of it, and gave up to obey and walk in the same, and truly loved Gods faithful Messengers and People, how despised and suffer∣ing soever they were, and freely gave up to partake with them of their suf∣ferings,
and did likewise suffer with them both in Person and Estate, by Imprisonments and spoil of Goods, for his tender Conscience and Testimony on the behalf of Christ Jesus; who as he gave him a Testimony to bear a∣gainst all Hireling oppressing Teachers and Priests, who preach for hire, and impose that great oppression and Anti∣christian yoke of Tithes, (according as he signifies in some of his Writings) so he gave up to suffer and endure Spoil, rather then in the least he could pay them, or gratifie the covetous mind or greedy appetite of such Shep∣herds as feed themselves, and not the Flock, and make a prey upon people, and with force and cruelty rule over them. And lastly, as he was a man fearing God, and of good report in his Country, being an exemplary Preacher of Righteousness in his Conversation, and one truly kind and ready to do good in his day; so God was pleased in some measure to endue him with a living Ministry, and experimental and innocent Testimony to tell of his good∣ness,
and speak forth his praise to others, from an inward sence thereof in himself, and to the comfort and en∣couragement of many that heard him. I speak what I know herein, he having at sundry times travelled with me in the work and service of God in the Gospel of his Son Christ Jesus; and we travelled together more particularly at one time to visit Friends in Surrey, Sussex, and Kent, in which Journey we were much and often comforted toge∣ther in the Lords work, and in the Assemblies of Friends, which was near upon a year before his decease. Well I am satisfied in my very Soul, that as he is taken away from the Evil to come, so he is entred into his Rest, and has his portion with the Blessed that dye in the Lord. From a Living Re∣membrance of this my dear Friend Stephen Smith, and a real sence of his Innocent Life, Spirit and Conversation, and in honour and due respect to that Divine power and work of God in him, I was really concerned in my Spi∣rit to give this precedent Testimony;
truly desiring and praying to God, that all Friends professing the same Truth, may concur in the same Spirit and ex∣ample of Faithfulness to the end; even so as to obtain the same blessed end of the Righteous, that will crown all our Labours, Travels and Sufferings which in this World we partake of, and en∣dure for the Testimony of Jesus and of a good Conscience. I am a Friend to the Truth, and the Souls of all men, G. Whitehead. Enfield, the 20th. day of the 1st. month, 1671/9.
Susanna Smiths Testimony concern∣ing her Husband. MY Testimony for my dear Hus∣band is, That he was a man of an upright heart towards God and man, and hated deceit; he was diligent and faithful in the service of the Lord; he did spend and was spent for the Everlasting Gospel, and is entred into Rest and Peace with the Lord for ever. Susanna Smith.
The Testimony that lives in my heart concerning the Life and Death of that holy and worthy Servant of the Lord, Stephen Smith. O The remembrance of that holy and worthy Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, by whose Heaven∣ly power he was made a holy Temple for the Lord to walk in, whose Ear∣then Vessel was filled with Gods Hea∣venly Treasure, by which the Life of Jesus was made manifest in his mortal Flesh, so that the excellency was of God, and not of man; so that by Gods holy power he was made a perfect and upright man, one that feared God, and hated all manner of Evil wheresoever it did appear: And indeed I can never forget him, whose blameless and inno∣cent Life, and holy Conversation, when he was amongst us, it was a good pat∣tern unto us; for he was a man of a meek and gentle, and of a tender Spi∣rit, in which he was very careful and tender to all in whom the least appea∣rance of Truth did manifest it self, for which his Travels and his Labours
were very great for the Truth and Christs sake, in whom he was made very instrumental, as in the hand of the Lord, that he thereby might beget a People unto the Lord; being not satis∣fied to eat his Bread alone, as many yet living can truly testifie to the truth hereof; knowing that he was a true and faithful Labourer in the glorious Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, for whose sake he was made willing to suffer, for he accounted it all joy that he was counted of the Lord worthy to suffer for his Name sake; who truly trampled upon Aegypts Glo∣ry, and chose rather to suffer afflictions with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of Sin for a season; who often said, he accounted nothing the Lord had blessed him withall, too dear to part withall for Christs and his Gos∣pels sake; concluding that it was but a reasonable Sacrifice to part with Life, and all that a man hath, for Christs sake; and he that could not part with all for Christs sake, was not worthy of him. And he was a man of a tender and of a broken Spirit, and always constant in his Love to all his Brethren
in the Truth, and having a great esteem of them therein; and whose care was very great over all the Flock of God, who was filled with the Spirit of wis∣dom and understanding, in which he truly laboured to prevent all manner of differences or discord that might happen among Brethren; and if any did happen, he was always willing to compose and reconcile all manner of differences, which would have been to the great dishonour of the Lord and his Truth, which was prevented by him, so that he was a true Peace-maker; and he was as a Father to the Father∣less, and as a Husband to the Widow; and as a Child, I have been often a par∣taker of his Fatherly kindness, and li∣ving still in the remembrance of the same, I hope I shall never forget but to return the honour and glory to God, who is the Fountain of all our blessings and mercies, from whence floweth all our fresh Springs, in and through Christ Jesus the Son of Gods Love, in whom was the Spring of Life flowing in and through him, even to the great satis∣faction of my Soul, as one that did but partake of the overflowings of that
Life, in which his Soul was deeply con∣solated and wrapt up in the Heavenly Joy of the Lord God: so that in the greatest extremity of his weakness, he would be very often declaring of the great and mighty loving kindness of the Lord God, by which he was lifted up above the fear of death: Nor was he afraid of the terrors thereof, so that a little before his departure, I being present with him, he being filled with Gods heavenly Spirit, by which he was enabled to pray and supplicate the Lord God of his Life, in which he was praising and magnifying that holy and innocent Life of Jesus, saying, Lord and dearest God, O assist in this Heavenly passage from death to life; who being subject to the will of his Heavenly Fa∣ther, said further to me, Now I am go∣ing into my sweet sleep; so that he imme∣diately and innocently laid down his head in perfect peace with the Lord, and lives for evermore. O the heavenly and the blessed Te∣stimony of the Lord God, that sprung in and through him, by a heavenly Ex∣hortation to them that came to visit him, saying, That it was a blessed and a
heavenly thing to have the mind clear and holy, free from all troubles and cum∣bers of this evil World, as he truly said his was; having all given up to the will of the Lord, that it might truly be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. O what a blessed and a heavenly Habitation is this for the Soul of man to rest in, which I have a full assurance of! And a little after there came in one to see him, and he exhorted him, to dread and fear the Lord God, and to repent of all his wicked∣ness, whatsoever that holy and pure wit∣ness in his conscience makes manifest to be evil: So if happily he may find mercy with the Lord, which will be better to thee, said he, then all the World be∣sides. And a little after came in another to see him; so that the mighty power of the Lord God was seen and felt, whereby he was refreshed again, and desired her to fear the Lord, that thereby she might be preserved out of all evil; and desired her to love the Truth above all, for the Truth is a very precious thing; and to be sure to keep low and humble to it, and not to be high-minded, nor exalted above the pure of God in her conscience, for that would he very hurtful to her.
About two or three days after, the blessed heavenly power of the Lord did arise in him, from which did spring a living and a heavenly Testimony in a holy remembrance of the tender deal∣ings of the Lord with him, from his Childhood to this very day; who said to his Sons, That his days were very near drawing to an end; and declared, how that his Father and Mother cast him off when he was but a little Lad: But the Lord had always preserved him, and his Blessings did always attend him, in raising him up by multiplying his Bles∣sings upon him, having been often in many great dangers and perils by Sea and Land: So, said he, having my mind chast and sober to God, and having the fear of the Lord placed in my heart, by which I was preserved out of evil, and do∣ing the thing that was right in the sight of the Lord; so that I found favour of the Lord, and gained the love and savour of all people, in dealing justly and truly with all people, not wronging any man. So this in charge he gave to his Sons, That they might always be kept chast and fober in their minds, having always their minds to the fear of the Lord placed in their
hearts, that thereby they might be preser∣ved out of evil, and doing always that that is just and right; and to be sure to be courteous and kind to all, loving the good in all, and bearing their Testimony against the evil in all wheresoever it doth appear. And whensoever (said he) you go about that which is weighty, take coun∣sel of good and sound Friends, so that all things may be done to the honour and glo∣ry of the Lord and his blessed Truth in which your blessings are all yea and Amen. And advised them, not to run into the Cumbers of the World, but to wait upon the Lord, and he will find out a way for them in his time: For the Lord (said he) is a calling and taking me out and from all Troubles and Cumbers, from the evil that is a coming upon this wicked World, in a good time wherein I am assured of that sound and perfect peaee, wherein my Soul resteth with the Lord for evermore; so that I have no more to do now, but de∣sire the Lord to make my passage easie to his Heavenly Rest. William Lickfold. He was born the 19th. of the 7th. Month 1623. He departed this Life the 22d day of the 7th. Month 1678.
A TESTIMONY FOR THE TRUTH, And against DECEIT & DECEIVERS, WITH A Reproof unto those who are not Faithful to the Truth which they are convinced of. By Stephen Smith. Isaiah 26.11. Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their Envy at the People. Verse 12. Lord, thou wilt ordain Peace for us; for thou host wrought all our works in us. Printed in the Year 1679.
A Testimony for the TRUTH, and against Deceit and De∣ceivers, with a Reproof unto those who are not faithful to the Truth which they are Con∣vinced of. FOr as much as it hath pleased the Lord in his great love and ten∣der mercy to visit many who have been long covered with Dark∣ness, and drawn by the Subtilty of the Serpent, working in a Mystery within, and without in his Instruments, from enjoying that Love and great Riches which is declared of in the Scriptures of Truth, which should be revealed in the latter dayes, in his Everlasting and Unchangeable Covenant; which Pro∣mise of the Lord many who had true breathing after him, and could not be satisfied with feeding with Swine upon
Husks, but truly breathed after Living Refreshment, and after that Bread which nourisheth that Birth which is Eternal, and have delighted in the righteous Judgments of the Lord, over the Enemy and Oppressor of mans Soul, through which Judgments the Love of God hath greatly been manifest, ha∣ving thereby brought to the know∣ledge of his Everlasting and Unchang∣able Truth, to the exceeding great re∣freshment and satisfaction of the Souls of many thousands, who have earnestly desired the same before the World and all its glory; and having received the same, in the Love of it, and known Freedom by it, in the Injoyment of the same, do meet together, as the man∣ner and practice was of those who lived in the Fear and Dread of the Lord in the Primitive times; so now in the pure Fear and Obedience to the just and equal requirings of this Creator, (whose Wayes are Equal, Right and Just) meets together to wait on him, to the end they may be refreshed and fed with the same Bread of Life, that
so the Plant which the Lord hath plan∣ted may grow, that so they may be changed from glory to glory, till at length they may come to bear the Image of the Heavenly, whereas for∣merly they have born the Image of the Earthly; and those who so meet the Spirit of Truth, can truely say they never waited on the Lord in vain, but do witness true refreshment from the God of Love, whether a word be spoken in their Meetings or no; so that they can truly sing in their Spirits of Mercy with Judgments, and hath not executed Judgment without Mer∣cy, in which hath greatly appeared his wonderful Love to lost Mankind, of which great and unspeakable Love, there are to this day (to the Glory and Praise of his great Name, even from his own Works) thousands of Living Witnesses, and hundreds have laid down their Lives in Nasty Holes, and Stinking Prisons, and many have been Banished, and many have suffered cruel Mockings, and many thousands the Spoiling of their Goods, whose Righte∣ous
Testimony through the Eternal Spirit of Love and Truth they have gladly born in this Day of Gods Power, to the exceeding Comfort and Refresh∣ment of all that are faithful Followers of the Lamb, but is, and shall be to the astonishment of all who persist in their Disobedience against the Spirit of Truth, and continue in their Rebel∣lion against it, and this righteous Testi∣mony, through all who are true Wor∣shippers in the Spirit and Truth, who are led and guided in all their ways by the Spirit of Truth, being Sons and Daughters of the Living God, so great∣ly beloved by him; so those that touch them in a wrongful manner do touch the Apple of his Eye, who created all things for his Glory; and though his Mercy is great in not executing Judg∣ment speedily, but gives space and time of Repentance; yet if they mind it not, but let the Day of Gods Love pass over their heads, that Terrible Voice they shall hear, My Spirit shall strive no more, let Flesh know that it's but Grass, and when the Spirit of the
Lord bloweth upon it, it shall fade as a Flower, and that in a moment when his Anger is kindled, which may be when the Worker of Iniquity is in the height of his vain glory, and greatest boasting: so as that righteous Testi∣mony (through all who are in the true Innocent Seed, unto which all the Blessings and the Promises of the Lord are) doth stand as a true Witness of the Lords great Love in this day wherein he is making known his great Power against all Workers of Iniqui∣ty, and unrighteous Actions, and de∣ceitful Workers, who can feign and flatter with all sorts of debauched Persons, and all dissembling Hypo∣crites, Persons of unstable minds, joyn∣ing with the cunning, twisting, twi∣ning Serpent, in all its appearances, in their earthly, sensual, and devillish wisdom, being in the Adultrous who∣rish spirit degenerated from the Spirit of Truth, holding a Profession of the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with re∣spect of Persons, receiving honour, and giving honour, according to the
Customs and vain Traditions of the World, by which means they have no knowledge of that Honour which is from Above: Yet notwithstanding these great Abominations which they commit in the sight of the Lord, and all them which live in their faithful Testimony against them, yet they lean upon the Lord, and think there shall come no evil upon them; but except such do speedily repent, and turn from their Abominations, and bow to the righteous Testimony of God in them, which shews them the deceitfulness of their hearts, to the end they may above, and before all, desire a clean heart, and a right Spirit, that so they may be single hearted toward their Crea∣tor, and all men; which, except that be known, the Lord will send a day upon them, wherein shall be weeping, and howling, and bitter Lamentation; and their Torment shall be so great, that in the Morning they shall wish it were Night, and at Night they shall wish for Morning, and many shall desire Death rather then Life: So I greatly
desire that all People would mind, in coolness, how it stands between them and their Creator, and deal impartial∣ly with themselves, for, of a certain, Cod will not be mocked, but such as they sow, such they must reap: So all mind the Fear of the Lord is to depart from Evil, that so the Curse of the Lord may be done away, and his Blessing known and received. And those that come amongst the Possessors of the Truth, who have heard the sound of it, and so a belief is raised in their hearts, that God is found by them that diligently seek him in the Way of Truth; many there be that are thus perswaded, and so fre∣quent Meetings (together with them that are in the work of Truth) in a bare Profession of Truth, never through∣ly given up to the end that Truth may be their Guide in all their wayes, but come and sits down with some reserve in their Hearts, which they covet to keep, as Achan did the goodly Baby∣lonish Garment, which was appointed for the Fire; but for so doing the
Curse of the Lord followed him, though his covetousness was a trouble to the Children of Israel for a time, yet at length God made it manifest; and so will the Lord do those who comes a∣mongst Friends with a reserve in their hearts; that which is appointed for the Fire, they that covet to keep, not∣withstanding the many Precious Meet∣ings they come to, and hear their con∣ditions plainly laid open to them, yet still consulting with Flesh and Blood, which will never yield that true obe∣dience should be given to the Lord, so cannot amend, but continue in the same course of Life, for not taking heed to the Councel of the Lord, nor giv∣ing wholly up to be guided by the Spirit of Truth; such are not in the the Way of Truth, but sit down as Branches by those of the Vine; but their Fruit doth manifest them: for those that deals so deceitfully with their own Hearts, how can it be ex∣pected they should be true to others? so such becomes an ill savour to Truth, as long as they continue so, and a bur∣then
and a trouble to them that are in the way of growing in the Truth; but let them know who harden their hearts against Reproof, and though they do come amongst them that live in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, and so meet together that they may receive a continual supply of the Bread of Life, and enjoy the presence of the Lord; yet their so coming with a reserve in their heart, they cannot profit by it: So at length, seeing they cannot bring the Way of the Lord to their way, they begin to grow cold in meeting, and so by degrees the Enemy draws out the mind, and then gets room for his consultations, and so perswades them to wait no longer, but that all Places are alike: and so at length some get into the Mass-House, with other silly People laden with sins, ever learn∣ing, and never able to come to the Truth; and begin to perswade themselves, (or the Enemy of their Souls per∣swades them) that there is a little dif∣rence in the Declaration of the Mini∣sters of Christ and Antichrist; their
words, say they, are all good, and so begin to build Babel again, having rejected that Love which did appear for their Everlasting good, having chosen to please themselves in some small thing, which they could not part with, though no better then a Mess of Pottage, for which many have sold an Eternal Inheritance; so with Cain they are in the Curse, wan∣dering up and down in that which is cursed of the Lord, and not beloved of good men; so the Lord hath dealt justly in making them manifest, They went out from us, because they were not of us, but their reward will follow them. And many others there be that come to Meetings, and hear Truth declared often, and confesseth its the Truth, but when they see, if they come to obey, they must take up a Cross to Flesh, either in denying to fear man, or else hazard of losing Goods, and some their Companions and Acquaintance, (though it may be in iniquity) and such like Baits the Enemy of mans Soul hath ready, for
that mind which is willing ro catch at them, to save that alive which is in the Curse; so sometimes they come, and sometimes they stay away, and then come again, and the Enemy of their Souls gets a wound now and then; but for want of giving up, at length the Enemy begins to be whole again, and so the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and quenched by degrees, and the Enemy grows stronger and stronger; and at length he gets these Reasons in the Creature, because the Enemy knows many will not be sa∣tisfied without some plausible Reason; so he tells many, why thou art but a poor Creature, or you are but poor Creatures, and what can you do with∣out power? so here the willing mind readily catches at this bait: and then when they are asked, why they give not up, O say they, we want power, O that I had but power to do so and so, how joyful should I be; and such like stuff the Enemy furnisheth them withall, who are willing to receive it, and in the mean time slight the ap∣pearance
of Christ, (the Light, in whom Power is received) by grieving and quenching his Holy Spirit of Truth, in which is the greatest manifestation of Love that God could bestow on lost Mankind, in making manifest his Son in their hearts, for the redeeming them up unto himself, out of their lost con∣dition, in the nature of Adam in the fall, up into the Nature of the Second Adam, which never fell: but how is this Love of God slighted by those who thus wilfully yield to the Ene∣my of their Souls, and rejecting the Lord, who searcheth the Heart and tryeth the Reins, and then say they want power; and its true, when peo∣ple have given themselves up to the power of the Enemy, whose nature is to do all the hurt he can, they may well say then they want power to do good, that being disesteemed and ac∣counted of as a thing of nought, hav∣ing cast behind them the great Love of God in his Son, and embraced some∣thing which the Enemy hath set be∣fore them, as some glory in the World,
and the like; but as he was alwayes a Lyar, (the Devil) so will he be found in this; for instead of giving them the glory of the World, he is fitting them for Gods Wrath and In∣dignation, that so when he is cast out of those more upright hearts, and more thankful, that he may possess those Swinish natures, and so throw them headlong into a Sea of Destructi∣on, whith others of the like bad na∣tures, of whom I shall say something. Those are they which have heard and seen something of Truth, by read∣ing Books, or speaking with some in the Truth, whose words being ac∣companied with power, proceeding from the Spirit of Truth, they not hav∣ing been able to resist, but standing over them, questionings and reason∣ing have been raised in them concer∣ning their buildings, whether or no they be upon the right Foundation; but that being catch'd too, which shews them their conditions so plain, that they have no assurance of their well-being, but in doubting, and reason∣ings,
and fears, through which secret∣ly torment doth arise; but their minds being from him that shews them their conditions, which, though it be the greatest Love that God could bestow on lost Mankind. yet in that it brings a Cross to flesh, seeing plainly that if they hearken to it, they must forsake all their vain Customs and Traditions of the World, with all its Lusts and Vanities; these things not agreeing with Flesh and Blood, which they are consulting, the mind being drawn from the Witness for God in their hearts, by their wilful yielding to the Enemy of their Souls, who is alwayes ready with his Baits to betray them who de∣sire ease in the Flesh, and whose minds are out in studying Arguments to keep them in the same, the subtle Serpent being here at work, to the end that the Creature may partake of his Table, for he knows that then they cannot partake of Gods Table, as the Scrip∣tures of Truth declares; so at his Table he hands out curious words, in Prayers, and hanging down the head
like a Bullrush, and with feigning and flattering words to all sorts of Deceit∣ful Workers, and doth help to turn and wind all sorts of Worship, which the Beastly Nature sets up, and so tells them there is Flesh as well as Spirit to be satisfied, and that they must live in sin, as long as they have a being here; and to others, whose natures be inclined to Lust, he provides plen∣tiful Dishes for them; and others, who are disposed to Drunkenness, he di∣rects them to Companions, and op∣portunity; and at his Table are va∣riety of Dishes for the Covetous man, or Proud, High, Heady, Boaster, Cur∣ser, Ranter, for all sorts that will come to his Table, he hath curious Dishes in a plenteous manner, and in all these he promises content and satisfaction; but as he ever was, so he is, and ever will be a Lyar; for let those speak who hath fed most plentiful at his Table, if ever they were satisfied, but that the more they fed the more hungry they were; let all these foremention∣ed, and Gamsters speak for themselves,
and Thieves, and Murtherers, and the like. But in some he works more in a Mystery, and furnisheth his Table with curious words, and so feeds them, and decks them; but alwayes at his Table he hath this Dish for all sorts of Pro∣fessors and Prophane, that they must live in Sin, in this Life; this is, as it were a Chain, by which he holds all (that will believe so,) fast to his Table; and then let them be as rich as they will, in comprehending, and getting into the Brain-knowledge the Scrip∣tures, and outward Learning, so though the work grows so high in the My∣stery of Iniquity, that the Enemy of the Soul hath exalted himself above all that is called God, and so makes a shew in fine words, and in long Prayers, and in curious Arts; yet whilst he can keep them in his Chain to his Table, if they cannot have ease in professing in one Sect, he will give them leave to profess in another Sect; and if that will not serve he will give them leave to go into the profession of Truth it self; and further, to meet together with
them in the Truth, any thing but hearing the Voice of the Son of God, and obeying, which brings to the Table of God, and so overthrows his Table; to any thing but this his Chain will reach: Now, as to what is before, those that have seen something of Truth, and some trouble hath by rea∣son thereof risen in them, but for love of a little ease to the flesh, such their minds being out, willingly goes into the Devils Chain, and so feeds at his Table, where they are furnished with Arguments against the Spirit of Truth manifested to lead and to guide into all truth, and so out of Sin, which is the Devils Chain; but being thus fur∣nished according to their hearts lust, being in the Adulterous Spirit, takes all occasion to speak evil of Truth, and them that are in it, who are true Worshippers of the Lord, according to his Will, in Spirit and Truth; so the god of the World having blinded their minds, an evil eye gets out, and this watches for the halting of them who are in Truth; and when the just hand
of God is gone out, in making mani∣fest some who have been in the pro∣fession of Truth, who have hardned their hearts against reproof, till at length their hypocrisie and guile is made manifest; on which, they here∣by take occasion to speak evil of the Way of the Lord, and them that are in it, the Enemy of their Souls giving them thereby some ease for the present; but it lasts not long, but the Fame of Truth is sounded in their ears again, by the Witness of God within, or else from those in whom it dwells without them; then the Lamb riseth, and gives torment again, and their Coverings be too narrow, and will not serve them, neither shall they; Wo to the Rebellious Children, saith the Lord, that take Counsel, but not of me, and that cover with a covering, but not with my Spirit: So all unrighteous Coverings which people of unstable minds are under, the Wo of the Lord is against, so what will become of them that are under them? O that men would in coolness consider, whose day of Gods Visita∣tion
in Love is not past, least by their often provocations, he visits in his great displeasure, and says, My Spirit is weary with striving, it shall strive no more: now for the sakes of many who have yet true Breathings after Living Refreshment, and are willing to take up Christs Yoke and Burthen, and to follow him that is meek and lowly in heart, that so they may rest for their Souls; for their sakes I shall give a brief Relation of the Ministers of Christ, and of the Ministers of Antichrist: First, The Ministers of Christ must know Christ, and see him, and believe on him, Joh. 6.40. But some will say, Who is there that knows not Christ? Doth not all that can read see what is writ of him in the Scriptures of Truth? And is not the Christ which you mean, who suffered without the Gates of Jerusalem, and the like? Yes, we do own the same Christ, and that which the Scriptures do declare of him is true, and we do expect no other; but to know him no further then the re∣port of him, (though that be true)
this is but a poor knowledge, which the Workers of Iniquity have, of all sorts, that lives visibly in gross and manifest Sins; and notwithstanding that knowledge, yet live and abound in the same; so that knowledge only (though that, as I have said, be true) is not sufficient to fit a man to be a Minister of Christ: But saith the dili∣gent Enquirer, What knowledge then is necessary for a Minister of Christ? To know him as he is the Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifest to his Saints: to know what is the Riches of the Glory of this Mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you the Hope of Glory, Collos. 1.26, 27. To know him as he is a Co∣venant given to the People, and a Light to enlighten them, manifested within them, to give the knowledge of God; and to know that he is the Light of the World, and how he hath enlightned every man that comes into the World: to know him to be the Word in the Heart and Mouth: to know him to be the Reconciler unto
God: to know him to be the Anoint∣ing, which is true, and teacheth all things: to know him to be the Spi∣rit of Truth, which is manifest to lead and to guide into all Truth: to know Christs Flesh, and what it is to eat it: to know Christs Blood, and what it is to drink it: but some will say all this may be read in the Scriptures: But by the way, though the words may be read in the Scriptures of Truth, yet the knowledge of the Mystery which is declared of in those words, is not attainable by reading them: But be∣cause some are willingly ignorant, and so desires to be, rather then to have true wisdom in Gods way, and so stumbles at all; I shall say a little con∣cerning seeing the Son, which is ne∣cessary for a Minister of Christ: First, To see him to be the great Love of God manifested to convince of Sin: to see him to be the wonderful Power of God, and how that he died, to the end, that whether we sleep or wake we should live together with him: to see him as he was manifest to destroy
the Works of the Devil. to see him to be the great Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the Flesh; and much more might be said of the knowledge and sight which a true Minister of Christ hath, but what hath been said is enough to satisfie the truly hungring and thirsting Soul; but the full loath the Hony-Comb: But is this all the up∣right-hearted say? Nay, they that thus have obtained mercy to have the knowledge of what is above declared, must receive it in the love of it, and this Love of God thus manifested in them they must give up to obey, being his Everlasting and Unchange∣able Covenant, which is the Key of knowledge, manifested to rend the Vail, and to break the Chain of Dark∣ness, and to open the Mysteries of the Scriptures of Truth, and to give the knowledge of God, whom to know is Eternal Life; so Iniquity be∣ing taken away, and Sin being purged through the knowledge of Christ, who is the Power of God, and God known to walk, and to dwell in them
through the Son of his Love, who is Gods Righteousness, as God hath said, I will dwell in you, and walk in you: The Eye of the Understanding being thus opened, and the Revelation of Christ being dayly witnessed to sit and to furnish them with Wisdom from above, to speak a word in season un∣to all conditions; being thus filled with the Love of God, and his Glo∣rious Appearance, a constraint lying upon them, through the Power of God that dwells in them, and from the great Love of God in the same, such cannot be silent, nor eat their Morsel alone; but the Love of God doth constrain them who have Wives, and Children, and Estates, and seve∣ral others that have no Wives and Children, to leave their Callings, and several Imployments, and go abroad as Sheep among Wolves, to declare this great and unspeakable Love, to the end, That People may be turned from Darkness to Light, and from Sa∣tans power, to the Power of God, that others may partake of the same Love
of God in his Son Christ Jesus with them: But for this their love, how Barbarously and Cruelly they have been used, many having finished their Testimony in Nasty Holes, and Pri∣sons, and other great Cruelties, which would be too long to relate; so these thus furnished with the Love and Power of God, and being obedient to the same, being Learned men in the Book of Life; these are not to take with them Scrip nor Purse, so as to be careful of Earthly things, (but as they have received freely, do Mini∣ster freely) but into what house they come, where this great Love is answer∣ed, in the same Love of God in mea∣sure, what things such set before them, for necessity they eat and drink, and the like, seeing it comes from their Fathers Love: but when they come into a place and cannot see, in the Counsel of the Lord, that that Love is answered in which they come, there they cannot receive, though in never so much necessity. True, say some, these are fit Qualifications for a Minister of
Jesus Christ; but be there any such now adays? How dost thou know them? Yes, I do testifie, as thousands beside my self are ready to give the same testimony, that such Ministers, qualified, as before-mentioned, there be many in this Day of Gods Power: But how do you know, may some say? I answer, By turning us to the great and unspeakable Love of God mani∣fested in our hearts, which shews us our conditions, how it stood between us and our Creator, as it had done long before, but we knew not that that was the appearance of the Son of Love, till those who had tasted, handled, seen and felt the powerful working thereof told us; but told us also, the first step must be through Judgment; so a be∣lief thereof being raised, and a clean and a perfect obedience yielded to it, we in time found its power in us, open∣ing the Eye of our Understandings, and revealed the man of Sin; and so came the knowledge of the Spirit of Truth to be revealed in us, and by it we had a sight of the unfruitful
Works of Darkness without in his In∣struments, and the sight of the Spirit of Truth, and those that were Mini∣sters of it: But notwithstanding this Testimony, if some should be hard to believe, let such deal so ingeniously with their own Souls, as to go and hear, and try, with a single heart, and hold fast that which is good; and this is desired, to the end that others may be partakers of the same Love of God, and of their assurance of their being reconciled unto him through his Son, to whom be glory for ever. Now there being a necessity that the Ministers of Christ should be qualified, as is before mentioned, the Ministers of Antichrist may be easily known; but for the sakes of such afore-mentioned, I shall lay down some marks of them: First, They are such who never knew the Son of God in the Everlasting and Unchang∣able Covenant manifested in them, so not learned men in the Book of Life, but are alienated from the Life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, knowing him manifested in them, who
is Infallible, but in their fallible wis∣dom, by the Art of Tongues, gets the Prophets, Christs, and the Apostles words, and something out of Hea∣then Authors, and so in their vain ima∣ginations patches up anothers Dis∣course; and so for the love they have for their god which is their Belly, they sell their Art at as dear a price as they can, for several hundreds by the year, some for more, and some for less, but all as dear as possible; as I heard a Priest say once, if it were not for Tythes who as would should preach for him: but this being so well known to all, that its alone for their god, which is their Belly, that their Mouths is opened, there is little need to speak of that, these being Sayers, but not Doers, so not accepted of God; these are they which run and are not sent, which speaks a divination of their own Brain, so not like to profit the peo∣ple, you may read of them at large Ezekiel the thirteenth, read the Chap∣ter; from such Priests and Prophets as these is Profaneness gone forth in all
the Land, read Jeremiah the twenty third; so they are sufficiently markt out in the Scriptures of Truth. But some say, we know all the Priests now adays are bad enough, and the smooth∣est of them preach for filthy lucre sake, but they speak good words; so we may do as they say, and as they do: O foolish people, is it not because you love such easie Prophets, who speak peace to you in your Sins, that you thus speak? have you not heard what the Scriptures of Truth sayes? Do men gather Grapes of thorns, or Figs of Thistles? By their Fruits you may know them: Should we not count him a very Fool that should go look for Figs on Thistles, or sweet water out of a bitter Fountain? What if they should say the Lord lives, that is a true say∣ing to them which know it in them∣selves; but its a Lye to them who say it, and know the contrary in them; but these Priests which Preach for Hire, cry peace to men whilst they put in∣to their Mouths, to the end their god may be supplyed, which causes and
constrains their Mouths to be open; but in case you deny to put into their Mouths, then Demetrius like, prepares War; crying out, we have a Law, and if you won't pay, we will make you pay: But by the way, what com∣pulsive Law of men doth Christs Mini∣sters use, or were they to use? prove any such thing in the Scriptures of Truth, that they were to compel any man to give to them: Now, if God hath appointed no such Maintenance by his Righteous Covenant and Law; Is it not stealth in his sight, to com∣pel and take that by mans Law, which God hath not appointed in his Law? Look about you Priests, for the Righ∣teous Judge will sit in Judgment, and to the Lambs Bar to give an account you must come, and then the twisting Serpent will stand you in no stead, but all things will be laid bare before you, what esteem you have of your god, which is your Belly, for the serving of which, how have you yielded unto the lying Spirit, and so like Ahabs Pro∣phets perswaded and instigated many
to go on in the Persecution, though to their destruction. Have you not told the Magistrates that the Quakers are Ring-Leaders of Faction, though you never come to their Meetings, nor never examined the cause why they dissented from you; nor never heard that they went about to disturb or molest any of their outward enjoy∣ments, but barely because they bore a faithful Testimony against the twisting twining Serpent, the great Enemy of mans Soul; which Spirit of Error your god cannot be served without: so a great stir and ado you make, in being Instruments of casting into Pri∣son, haling and tearing away the Goods, and the like; from those who lives in the Fear and Dread of the God Al∣mighty, and in peace with men though in enmity with the Serpent, the Ene∣my of mans Soul: so in the Innocent Blood which hath been shed in Nasty Holes, and Stinkiug Prisons, cries a∣loud unto the Righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, who is Lord of all, who created all at his pleasure, and
can destroy all in the same; those that be innocent, out of the revengeful spirit, have committed themselves, and so cannot use any compulsive way, with Weapons that are Carnal, but in plain Demonstration and Power of the Spirit of Truth, and their innocent Cause to the Judge of all they have committed, to be cleared in his will and time, who will assuredly do it. But further, to clear that you are the Ministers of Antichrist; if, notwith∣standing what is declared, any yet be in doubt: Hearken what Christ saith to the Wicked, I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye cloathed me not: sick, and in prison, and visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or thirsty, or a stranger, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me; and these shall go away into ever∣lasting punishment, Matth. 25. In the same Chapter he shews the Righte∣ous mans love, and his reward; and how did they express their love to Christ? Did they do it in speaking great words of his Name? No, as you may read, they visited his Brethren in their necessities: so mark by the way, there were Righteous men, and now are, though the Ministers of An∣tichrist for the gods sake, would have all erre and stray again from the Lords way; but the Pearl for which they have sold all, and bought, is of more value then so; but since Christ hath Brethren, are not they them which are led by the Spirit of Truth? and if people be given up to obey it, will it not lead them out of the Spi∣rit of Error? If so, then must they not depart from your wayes, who are in the Revengeful Spirit? Well then, since those that are led by the Spirit are Sons of God, as the Scriptures of Truth declare, Rom. 8. and Heirs with Christ; for he that sanctifieth
and them that are sanctified are all of one, wherefore he is not ashamed to call them Brethren: now since there is such an unity between Christ and his Followers, Shall it avail them any thing, who call upon Christ, yet per∣secute so near Relations, as his Bre∣thren? And since those that visited them not in their necessities, received such condemnation, what will become of you? And you, Generation of wicked Doers, who have been the cause of the Imprisoning so many of Christs Relations, where several hun∣dreds have laid down their lives for their faithful Testimony against you, because of your Adultery from the Lord, and his Worship, which is to be performed in Spirit and Truth, and have set up worships according to your own hearts Lust: and because of the Lords Patience, and Long-suffering, and great Mercy, how do you har∣den your hearts against Reproofs, and for good return evil, and so go on scoffing and mocking: well, though the Lord hath exercised a great deal
of patience, it's my belief, it will not last long; but he will execute Righte∣ous Judgment, and plead the cause of the Innocent, who hath committed all to him, with Praises and Glory from his own works for ever. Stephen Smith. The 21th. day of the 11th. Month, 1667.
A PROCLAMATION By way of EXHORTATION Unto all the Inhabitants of England; Concerning Fasting and Prayer: And that they may come to a certain Discerning and Knowledge of the Will of God therein, (who is King of the whole EARTH. [First by way of Preparation unto a True FAST] COme all you who expect to be Heard and Accepted of the Living God; Fasting and Prayer, in the Spirit of Holiness, is required
as Necessary thereunto: but the want of a certain Knowledge Discerning, how, and in what manner the same ought to be Performed, (therefore it is that people are rejected) being all Vain Service and Lost Labour, where no Reward is received, or when they ask amiss, what answer shall such have, judge ye? And therefore, be Admo∣nished, I beseech you, to mind that which gives you a Discerning and cer∣tain Knowledge in this weighty Work: You may read what the Lord said by his Servant Isaiah, chap. 8. concerning Fasting; and what Christ Jesus said, Mat. 6. but how long may people read these Sayings. (as well as others) and yet have no certain knowledge of the Will of God therein? I speak of such who are out of the way of a True Un∣derstanding; which all are who are in a bare Confession, with their Mouths, that God ought to be feared; but the Heart, that not being right in his sight, Infidelity that taking place there; from whence a Conclusion is drawn, That Sin, which is Evil, can't be parted with;
this is a great Evil indeed, set up in the Heart by the spirit of Antichrist; where a Form of Words, and large Confes∣sions concerning God and Christ are made; but the Blessed and Effectual Workings of God's Spirit in Flesh, for the Destroying of Sin, that being de∣nyed, the Enemy's works (which is Sin and Evil) they continue in the Heart (contrary to the Blessed Will of God) by which means the Nobi∣lity of Man's Understanding that is Clouded and Darken'd through Error and Falshood; by which means the Minds of Mankind are exercised in a Brutish Understanding concerning Spi∣ritual Matters; imagining a Perform∣ing of Service to God by confessing, That he ought to be feared, (and yet live out of what they confess in a Talk) that all good Success and Blessing comes from him, &c. So then, let such be judged by their own words, who con∣fess he ought to be feared, and yet live in Sin and Evil, under a strange Delusion, That those Works can never be so destroyed, as to know Dominion and
Freedom from them on this side the laying down the Body, or at least, till about that time of separation from all outward vi∣sible things: So here Sin, the Continu∣ance of that hath been pleaded for by them who would be called Christians, and would be accounted such who fear God, and that they are in his Service, though never expect to be free from sin; What Service is that in Evil? And what Reward shall Evil Works have? Is not sin an Evil work of the Evil One? And must not the Works of the Evil One, if continued in, have a Bad Reward? Oh that people would Fear God in Deed and in Truth! for they that fear him will do no Evil: So the way of a Right Understanding, that leads quite contrary to Sin and Evil: So its strong Delusion indeed, to expect a Right Understanding in an Evil Way; and Presumption indeed it is, to hope for Good out of Evil. Oh, be Awakened to Righteous∣ness, in which there's no sin! and then will the Eye of the Understanding be
opened to see the Man of sin, who hath exalted himself above that of God in Man, under Confessions and Professions of the Name of God and Christ, whilst that signified by the Name, which is Power manifested in Flesh, for the revealing the Man of sin, and destroying his works, that hath been denyed by the Exaltation of the Man of sin in man; by whom Man∣kind hath been exalted above the Pure Principle of God in man, even above the Light of that Blessed and Unerring Spirit of Christ, by which that which is reproveable is made manifest: But through Unbelief of God's Love there∣in, Mankind in a great part being held under strong Delusions of Satan, their minds being exercised in a Brutish Un∣derstanding, some have called that Blessed Principle of God in man, a Devilish Light; and others a Bewilder∣ing Light, or a Natural Light; so that all that is of God in man that hath been denyed (whose Work do you think this is?) But if it were so, as the Wicked One in the wicked hath con∣cluded,
may it not be said now, as it was in the dayes of old, after God had created Mankind upon the Earth, and they had corrupted their Wayes, which displeased God, who in his Dis∣pleasure said, My Spirit shall not alwayes strive, &c. Then was not Destruction nigh? but in that there was a time in which God's Holy Spirit did strive with flesh, it plainly appears, the good will of God was therein to have had it otherwise; but Mankind resisting his Way of bringing it to pass, the Way of Salvation that was removed, and a Way of Destruction let in; so the Way of Salvation then that was by the mov∣ing and working of God's Good Spi∣rit, the which had place in Noah, who was a perfect man in his day, who being moved in a True Fear of God had a Right Understanding, in which he was a Preacher according to the Will of God. So that Blessed Spirit of God, by which Noah had regard and was acted by, though it was rejected by Mankind in their corrupt Wayes, yet it was not Devilish nor Natural, as
Mankind in their Brutish Understand∣ing in great measure have concluded: but the least measure of that pure Principle of God in Mankind of his Blessed Spirit, is Unerring; the which in measure, in all Ages, in God's Time and Season did strive in Mankind, and for the good of Mankind, that through it they might have been Preserved out of Corrupt Wayes and Works, which Corrupt Wayes and Works was and is the Cause of all Heavy and Grievous Judgments in Ages past, and to come upon Mankind: So its plain and evi∣dent, how Gracious, Merciful and Long∣suffering God hath been throughout all Ages through some measure of the shining of the Light of his Unerring Spirit, notwithstanding the Great and Grievous Provocations of Mankind in their Corrupt Wayes, by which their Understandings were and are darkened, that they could not come to a clear Discerning what manner of Love of God that was unto them (as it is written) How often is the Candle of the Wicked put out, Job 21. So its
plain, that was and is the Love of God in the Light of his Unerring Spi∣rit, by which the Wicked were shewn their Wickedness in all Ages; and the putting that Love from them was, and is the Cause that the Wicked perish in their Wickedness, through the Hard∣ness of their Hearts, and Unbelief of the Love of God in his Blessed Prin∣ciple of Light, which shines sometimes even unto the Wicked, though they cry, Depart, I desire not the Knowledge of thy Wayes: And though this Wicked∣ness of the Wicked, under many fair pretences of Confessions and Profes∣sions of God, have labour'd to put away the way of the Lord, and through many Devices hath the Wicked One in his Agents in their Wickedness, set up many Corrupt Wayes; yet the Way of the Lord remains Pure forever, and can never be Corrupted, but it remains a True Witness against all Evil and Corrupt Wayes whatsoever. And this Perfect Way of God was the Way of the Upright in Heart in all Ages, by which they were led out of
Evil (though under more Servitude) before the fulness of time, when it pleased God so to cause his Light to shine forth in Flesh, in an absolute per∣fect Dominion over all the Lusts of the Flesh, where Satan could get no En∣terance, though Forty Dayes Christ Jesus was Tempted by him; so herein was the Son, who is the Heir of all, manifested. So all the true Prophets in all Ages, they had their Testimony from a measure of the Light of that Spirit; and there their Testimony end∣ed (who were Faithful) and the Law written in Tables of Stone, that was by the Light of that Blessed Spirit, by which all might see and learn to come to Christ, in whom the Law is fulfilled: So here is the Prophet, whom Moses spoke of, that God would raise up, whom all is to hear; and every Soul that will not hear that Prophet, De∣struction attend it. So let none say in their Hearts, Who shall ascend into Heaven, that is, to bring this Prophet Christ from above? or, Who shall descend into the deep, that is, to
bring up Christ again from the Dead? For the Word is nigh, even in the Heart and Mouth; which Word of Faith the Ministers which were True did Preach, and them which are True do Preach; and herein is the Labour of them whose Abiding is in the Word, that others may be turned to the Word in the Heart and Mouth, that by it they may be reconciled unto God: And this Blessed Word was in the beginning, before words were; All things being made by him, in whom is Life, and the Life was (and is) the Light of Men, who believe therein: And though the World did not, nor doth not know the Love of God here∣in, yet he was and is in the World; and though his Appearance was and is rejected by most, yet some did and do receive him, who felt and feel his Power to overcome the Lusts of the Flesh, which is Sin and Evil; which Unspeakable Love of God, shed abroad in the Hearts of the Primitive Chri∣stians, by this Free Gift of his Holy Spirit, which made them who received
the same, who were truly sensible of God's Love therein, undergo great and grievous things, some things of which may be read in the Scriptures of Truth. So their Fasting and Prayers being performed by the Movings and Guidings of that Blessed Principle of God, how were such preserved by the Power of God, in the Peace of God, wherein their Souls rested in God? So the Blessed Name of the Lord was unto them a strong Tower (which was the same to the Righteous in all Ages) but never was a more clearer Discern∣ing thereof then in this Age; there being a Cloud of Witnesses of the Everlasting Love of the Everlasting God herein: and so they are Blessed who live up to that Blessed Principle of God in them, and continue Faith∣ful to the End in the Testimony there∣of: O the Remembrance of them will be had in great Esteem in Ages and Generations to come. So now, that which is Chiefest of all, and of greatest Value, let that be first minded, that all things may be
done according to the Will of God; in order to which a Right Understand∣ing is necessary, the which is better then Gold and Silver; for the Wicked may possess Gold and Silver, and things visible to their Hurt, where a Right Understanding is wanting; for if Know∣ledge and Understanding be wanting, people perish: Therefore be advised to wait in the Way of Understanding, the Fear of the Lord God, who made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things else according to his good Plea∣sure; here is the beginning of Know∣ledge, and to attain to a Right Under∣standing: for, in the Fear of the Lord there's no Evil in that Way. So away with Invention and Imaginations of Fearing God, whilst Conclusions are made, That Sin can't be parted with; all Wayes made up by men in Sin, are from a Corrupt Understanding: So come to the Fear of God, and he will teach us his Wayes; and all that come there come out of Evil; for there's no Evil in God's Wayes: so that they that are in God's Way, are out of Evil;
by which it plainly appears, that all Wayes where Conclusions are made, That Sin, is in them; or, that they can't live out of Sin; or, that they know not a Way out of Sin; all such, where such Conclusions are made, are out of a Right Understanding, and their Wayes are Destructive, and their Works in them Wayes are Destructive, so that all who endeavour to save their Lives there, do want a Right Under∣standing; for Transgression, which is Sin, is the Cause of Death; so all that are raised from Death, are raised from Sin, the Cause of it: so then, all that keep their Lives there, shall lose Life; and all that lose their lives there, shall find Life: So Blessed are they who serve the Living God, they do as they should do; so that's no Evil (but Good) so let none think in their Per∣verse Wayes, that they shall be fed with Knowledge and Understanding there (No, no) they will Starve and Perish there for want of Understan∣ding: so let all deal clearly with them∣selves, in coolness and stillness, in the
silence of fleshly wisdom, in a true Examination concerning the wayes they live in and let that which is wrong be rejected and that which is right received; and in that which is Right will be n what Fast is Pleasing and Acceptable in God's sight; and that Prayer which will be Effectual and Prevalent for the good of the Soul in a Right Understanding will be seen: So now, begin a Fast; come, pitty the Oppressed; let the Prisoner go free; have Compassion on the Poor; break off Imquities by a True Repentance, in turning from Evil, the Cause of An∣guish and Trouble upon the Soul, that the Soul may be set at Liberty to praise the Lord; and so let hard hearts be melted and broken down, and the seat of Unbelief, by reason of which the Love of God in the Light of his Son  rejected, and by that means p souls are kept in Bondage con∣ o the Will of God, let that seat  Unbelief be thrown down; for God  greatly displeased at the Presumpti∣on of Mankind, who have exalted
themselves in their own wills, where Self exerciseth Will-worship in a feign∣ed Humility, whereby the Cross is counted Foolishness. So Christ's Ex∣hortation, To take up the Cross daily, and deny Self, God's Love therein that is slighted; the Cross that being with∣out, Fasting that being without, Prayers that being without, all being done without a Right Understanding; for want of which Ptetended Fasting is vain, Prayer is vain, and the Con∣versation of Mankind is vain and un∣profitable, where the will of man is set in Opposition against the Will of God in his Heavenly Guift, even the Light of his Unerring Spirit, by which the World is reproved of Evil: and this is, and will be the World's Con∣demnation, their sleighting the many Visitations of God's Love, in that he doth manifest unto them what is re∣provable in his sight; but they being unmindful of God's Love therein, by which means their Souls are in great Bondage under Sin and Corruption; subjected there under a vain Hope by
the Subtilty of the Serpent, That though they live unseparated from Sin, yet they shall obtain Justification through Christ, and see a good End, or good brought forth through Sin be never finished; this kind of Perswasion is through strong Delu∣sions of Satan, whose workings are in a deep Mystery of Iniquity in preten∣ded Godliness; but his End therein is, to make void that Blessed coming of Lord and Saviour to finish Sin, and to put an End to Unrighteousness, and thereby to make way for the bring∣ing in Everlasting Righteousness, that souls in that Blessed Principle of God may rest in Peace. Now where this is not known, be Awakened, I beseech you, unto Righteousness, which is God's, and no otherwayes man's, but as he be∣comes stript of his own Eyes, and so comes before the Lord with a Broken and Contrite Spirit, and Heart hum∣bled at his sight, who seacheth it by his Light, and shews to man in the Cool of the Day what beastly Imaginations are lodging therein; to the end, that
man might lye down at the Feet of his Appearance in a True Fast, in abstain∣ing from Evil; and Praying in the Spirit, that by the Exercise of God's Love in his striving therewith, Evil may be overcome, and so the soul set at liberty from Evil, the cause of Trouble and Anguish, which is upon every soul that's in Evil. So let every one that names the Name of the Lord depart from Evil. Come Curser and Swearer, be perswaded to be awakened, and see what a sad Condition thy soul is in: but if thou wilt not, but hardenest thy heart, what will the taking the Name of the Lord into thy Mouth avail thee? Or Un∣clean Person who art defiled, and en∣deavouring to defile others, remem∣ber, That none in Ʋnclaanness can en∣ter into Heaven; so except thou leav∣est thy Evil therein, thy Expectations of God's Kingdom will fail thee. Come Idolaters, who are making Gods of Gold, and Silver, and Wood, and Stone, and so are bowing down to the works of your own hands; that
is a great Abomination and Evil, great∣ly to be lamented, who are so far blind∣ed from the Appearance of the Light of God's Spirit in your own Hearts, which being taken heed unto and obeyed, brings to the Knowledge of God; but that Love of God being re∣jected, what strangers are you to God, and the Saints of Life? and so are be∣come Beastly and Bruitish in your Un∣derstandings, your Bands of Corrup∣tion through sin and iniquity being made strong; and so under strong de∣lusions are bowing to Pictures to put you in mind of God and the Saints, though they cannot hear, nor see, nor smell: what savour think you to get out of them Stocks and Stones? Be Awakened, I beseech you, to Consi∣deration; and know, that it's some measure of that Grace and Truth which Jesus of Nazareth was filled with; by Vertue of that all the Saints savour to God, and one unto another; which Grace hath appeared unto all, but the Saints or Believers, were and are taught by it: so that which convinces of Evil
is to them that believe in it and obey it, an Instructer in the way of Life. So leave your Folly in Bowing and Cring∣ing to the East, and to you know not what; and answer the Love of God in his Principle of Light in you, which makes manifest that which is Evil; and then will the Eye of your Understan∣ing be opened, to the beholding of him who fills Heaven and Earth with his Presence, so that no Darkness can cover man from him, who is God of the North, South, East, and West; who will spoil your glorying, who are boasting your selves of the Antiquity of your Religion, who first went from the Cross, which is the Power of God, and so got up in a form of words, and then set the Cross upon the House, of Stone, &c. Alas! your Religion is seen through; and all who hang upon your Skirts, they must have a share of the shame, which is coming upon that Adulte∣rated whorish Spirit, which hath led the minds of the people out from a sense of the Royal Law of God
within man, so that the stream of God's Love therein to Mankind, that hath been stopt; and in the Night of Apo∣stacy the stream of Malice, and Envy and Hatred, that hath run in your Streets, where the Innocent Blood∣shed lyes at your doors. So it's time you were awakened to a true Repen∣tance, that you may come to the knowledge of Salvation through the Remission of your sins: for it's the sa∣ving of your souls, I seek, and not the destruction of your bodies; so Truth is my weapon, which I desire may reach to that of God which is Truth in you; that so the pure Language, which is Truth, may be restored in all; and the Royal Law of Love therein may shew it self, which gives an Understanding, To love God above all, and our Neigh∣bours as our selves, and to do to all men as we would they should do unto us. Come all you who conceive mis∣chief on your Beds in your hearts, and cannot rest till you bring it forth in∣to action; now consider what manner of evil this is, which though it may be
covered for a time, if continued in, ruin and destruction is in the way thereof. Come you who live in Pride and Idleness, following the lust of the Eye, the lust of the Flesh and Pride of Life, who live in fulness of Bread and Wan∣tonness, Feasting and making Merry over the pure Principle of God in you; this is a great Evil: therefore be admo∣nished to mind that God in you, and Watch and Pray in the same, that so by that which is good of God, the Evil may be overcome, and the root and ground judged from whence all evil springs. Come all you Drunkards and Glut∣tenous Persons, who waste and spoil the good Creatures, which are ap∣pointed for the necessary use of Man∣kind; read what is written in Isa. 5.11, 12. What a miserable life are you in who are attended with Wo and Misery, who are so far separated from the love of God in his Son, and the Do∣minion that is therein to use and order all things aright, according to the
will of God? For want of this know∣ledge how are many overcome with Strong Drink? the which having Do∣minion, how are many there un∣manned of that natural ability of a man, and so lye lyable to other Temp∣tations, whereby the soul lyes in bon∣dage? Come now, be perswaded to mind that love of God which in the Cool, when the Drink is out, shews you what a great evil this is; which if not departed from, ruin is in that way both of Soul, Body and Estate. Come you Gamesters of all sorts, who spend your time in Gaming and Sports, who are coveting an Increase by such unequal and unjust wayes, and many spending their time in such Pra∣ctices, How many Families are ruined by such a Course of Life? and what an evil example Parents thereby shew to their Children and Families? This is a great evil, such being an ill sa∣vour who are living therein, both to God, and man who fears God. Therefore be admonished, to break off these evils by a true Repentance,
and learn to redeem time, that a Change may be witnessed (before you go from hence) by vertue of the Power of Christ, which often moves against evil: so let not the just alwayes be resisted by the unjust; but if the just principle of God be minded and joyned unto, then will the unjust be overcome, and the just set up; in which all that dwell will be good savour in their day, and a good example to all. Come all you who are exalting a false Birth, where your Ears are stopt and your Eyes are closed, so that you have neither heard, nor seen, nor hand∣led that which was from the beginning; even that word of Life (which ever∣lasting Life was with the Father, and was and is manifested to Believers) from whence Testimony is given of Gods love therein, where the true fel∣lowship is witnessed in the Blessed Light of God; which all you, who are exalting a false Birth, do despise, and speak very evilly of, or at least, very slightly: So the true Heir hath been rejected, and not thought fit to
raign; having been called by you who are exalting the false and untimely Birth, either a Devil (which some have called him; and others, Natural, or a Fool: by which it may be seen, how the Serpent's Wisdom hath been set by, by the Adulteress, who would fain have her Bastard to be Heir; for which end how seemingly fair hath the Harlot Trimmed and Decked her self? being arrayed in Purple and Scar∣let, and decked with Gold and Preti∣ous Stones and Pearls; her Religion being in her head, from whence Abo∣minations are let into the Heart; where if the Light appear to search it, it is mocked and sleighted by Ishmael: So that false Prophet he is set up, who cryes out, No Revelation now; so the deceitful heart being after the false Prophet, gross darkness that covers: so the love of God in the Blessed ap∣pearance of the Light of his unerring Spirit, that is not comprehended; so the Eye hath not seen, nor the Ear heard, neither hath it entred into their hearts, the Mercies and Goodness of
God, which is to them that fear him, and love his appearance in the Heart, where the Light of his Blessed Spirit doth shew forth his goodness, from whence is Ministred forth life and strength to the poor soul, strengthning it against the appearance of evil: so the soul be∣ing made sensible of the Peace of God, and rest through the Revelati∣on of his Holy Spirit, which causes joy and gladness to the Soul; having found a friend in its adversity, it sets a high value and esteem of him, and is wil∣ling to be guided and directed by him. So the Harlot is seen, and the false Birth is seen, and the false Prophet which steals the true Prophets words is seen: so the Adulteress may Cry long enough, and Scold long enough, and Peep and Mutter, all her Whine∣ings in seeming Prayers, and Teaching Doctrines all end in filthiness and sin in her best duties; and yet this Impudent Harlot concludes, There is none like her; and her Birth is the true Birth; and all the rest are false: But her deceit is manifest, and her Sorceries and
Witchcraft is seen; and a Bed of Tor∣ment is prepared for her: so they are Blessed that fear the Living God, and sanctifie him in their Hearts, who do not commit Leudness with the Harlot, nor add any thing to the maintaining of her Gallantry. Come all you Ranters, who have gotten some words of Truth, but do use them in an exalted spirit, in which you are swimming up and down above the pure stream, which flows from the pure meek principle of God, the na∣ture of the Water of Life, which comes from the Fountain of all good, that be∣ing to drive away all filthiness of Flesh; where that hath passage, it refreshes and keeps green and fresh, in a good sa∣vour to God and man. But you Ran∣ters having lost its savour, are exalted above that which is lowly and good, being under a great Imagination of a knowledge of good and evil, on which, through the subtilty of the Serpent feeding you, are become dead to any true sense of the Vertue that flows from the living Power, from whence through
disobedience you being shut out: What a do you are making? some crying out against Meeting, as formal; and that you feel not the Power that was a∣mongst them: which indeed is no wonder when you are past feeling, and so being tossed up and down in your minds in an exalted state, some appearing in a singular pretended Zeal, under a voluntary humility, as if you were Wiser and Holier then others (the Serpent here having puft up) sets a judging the Body, and feeds his members who waits for hurt, as by the slipping of some through weakness, or the like, and so gets all occasions of making Parties and Rents, still the Ser∣pent being covered under a pretence of a higher Attainment; but at length, after some time of exercise in this work, and through the everlasting love of God in the Body, in preser∣ving it sound and intire, where his will is done, and a fight given of the Enemy's working therein, and so not able to prevail: At length many go out in Distraction to Meetings, and
there make sad noises, to prevent (if possible) the going forth of the Decla∣ration of Truth, as much as in them lyes; keeping people from a Reception thereof by their Babbling and Squal∣ling to Disturb Meetings, it having plainly appeared. But their Nourish∣ment being from the Vine of Sodom, disobedience to that which they might be convinced of, being the cause from whence the first going out was; so the Root being corrupt, the Fruit is cor∣rupt: so all in time grow dry and wi∣thered, being an ill savour therein, and a stink whilst they live herein up∣on Earth; so that both the way and end in that way is destructive. The which may serve for a warning to all who are convinced of the Truth, to take heed how they slight Gods love therein, in disobeying that Principle of God in them, which is meek and lowly; and all that live in true Obe∣dience to it, they live in safety, where evil in uncleanness cannot enter, nor haughtiness hath no place there; but they that answer that Blessed Principle,
they rise in its nature to hate unclean∣ness and haughtiness; so in its nature of meekness and lowliness, all who grow here bring forth good Fruit, which is a Blessed savour in his sight, who is Creator of all; and all who are grafted into this root, and abiding therein, do feel sap and nourishment from the same, whereby they spring, grow and flourish in a green, lively, sensible life of the exercise of God's love to mankind; and so dare not appear otherwise in the sight of men, then they stand approved in his sight who sees all things: and so, meeting to∣gether to wait upon him, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, all gathering together in his Blessed Name, feeling true Refreshment in his Pre∣sence: strength there by is renewed to love God above all, and to love one another, and to watch for the good in one another; and to testifie against the evil, which may be an oc∣casion of defiling or hurting any; still waiting in meekness and love, to the end the good may be preserved, and
that which is evil resisted: And though this love by many may be rejected, yet it is that which will carry them who are exercised therein above the head of all opposition; and preserve them who keep their Habitation therein out of all extreams, even to finish their course with Joy and Peace in that Crown of Life which is everlasting. Come all you who live in Envy, Hatred, Malice, Strife and Contenti∣on, Masters and Dames of Familes, who are in Branglings, and evil and rash Speakings, and Discontents; these Fruits proceed from a corrupt and cursed ground; and so is an ill savour and bad example to your Families: This is a great evil. And all Children who are Stubborn and Heady, who do not obey your Parents, as it is meet in the Lord: This is a great evil. And all Servants who are not Sub∣ject and Obedient in your several places, but are high-minded, and can∣not bear Reproofs; but are ready to Answer again, and to be Disquiet, and
Murmur, and Whisper, and to tell Tales to stir up Anger and Strife: This is a great evil. NOw to the good in every particu∣lar is this writ, even that good Principle of God; by which if taken heed to, its nature is, to make mani∣fest that which is evil; and it will not in the least agree with any thing that is evil: That is a Pearl indeed, which the Earthly mind and wisdom hath kept people from the knowledge of. (but the way of the upright, which was and is out of evil.) And so the fear of offending God, by obeying his good gift, that is good, and out of evil; which is a true and right way to a clear understanding what to abstain and Fast from, and what to Pray in and for according to the will of God. So a Testimony of the everlasting love of God in his way, which is perfect, many have received, where the Eye
of Understanding hath been opened, from which, that is seen which was from the beginning (even the word of life) in which there's no Evil: so its good and just that this be confessed to before men, and great evil to deny it; so its the good which is of God, by which all evil is overcome; so Blessed are they who overcome the evil by the good, and so are built and estab∣lished through the good word of God; by which the soul being freed from bondage and corruption in sin and evil, from which the soul being set at liberty, on the unspeakable love of God herein in his Son, manifested to destroy the Devil's works, which is sin and evil, here is freedom through the the Son of God's love in Deed and Truth: so that Scripture is fulfilled, If the Son sets you free, then are you free indeed: whose Blessed freedom is out of sin and evil. So the Blessed end of the everlast∣ing love of God, in his coming in the Light of his unerring Spirit of life and power, to finish sin, and put an end
to transgression, this is seen and known to be the richest and choicest of his many mercies to mankind; the which mercy of God being rejected, or ob∣structed through the vain imaginations and evil ways set up by man's wisdom in the fallen estate from a right under∣standing; where conclusions are made, That sin cannot be overcome: I say to all such who are at ease under that conclusion, they are fled to lying va∣nities, where being from a sense of God's mercies in his Son, and there dwelling and abiding, their habitati∣on is in Darkness, their Fasting is in Darkness, their Prayers are in Dark∣ness, their Fellowship is in Darkness, and their Professions and Confessions of God and Christ are in Darkness, where they know not what they say, or what they do, being in Darkness; and there reading the Testimony of the holy men of God, they are quite blind to what the Will of God is therein: so through Darkness the way of God that being hid, how many ways have been set up in the dark? the Eye, that
should see, that being shut; and the Ear, that should hear, that being stopt; the Vultures eye, that being open, which could never see the way of God: so people under gross darkness, being led about there by the Vulterous eye, an evil eye; how are they on heaps about the words, being on heaps in Parties? so heaps in Parties be∣ing up, one Party cryes out, Lo here; another, Lo there: and so many Parties with their Lo here, and Lo there, are set up; one Party crying out, Stand further off, my way of building and fashioning in Professions and Confessions of God and Christ, is better, and more righteous then thine: Another Party climbing up another way, cryes down that fashion, and sets up another sin∣gular way of pretended righteousness; then, Stand further off; my way of Con∣fession is best of all; (till another rises from the same imaginary ground,) and so being blind in that eye which should see; and in that wretched condition, having put evil for good, and good for evil; and light for darkness, and
darkness for light; and so in the dark∣ness and evil, what labour and pains have the heaps of Parties taken to make darkness light, striving by all the Arts and means imaginable to Eclipse and Darken the Light of the Son; and for the effecting their designs, what Cu∣rious Workmen in Flourishing, and Painting, and Daubing and Smoothing have the many Parties set up? being herein agreed, as plainly appears: That darkness must be light; and whosoever speaks to the contrary, they all wonder at that work: For say the several Parties in effect, Though indeed we do much differ in our fashions in Confessions and Professions, and therein do many times quarrel, and fall out, to the shedding of much Blood, as by experience is known; yet in this we do much agree [in spurning against the light which lighteth all man∣kind.] And though Christ said, I am the light of the World; and though God be called, light; and though it be said, In him is life, and the life is the light of men; and, That God, who is light, search∣eth the heart, &c. And though those
who Ministred from Christ did, by their Declarations and Writings, en∣deavour to turn people to the Light (to God, who is Light) and though he be the Father of Lights, and all that are begotten by him, are begotten by his light, and brought forth into the light, which shining in the heart, clears the understanding of darkness and error; and though what is reprovable be made manifest by the Light (Immanuel, God who is light with his people.) Not∣withstanding all this, and much more that is upon record, how ignorant are the many Sects and Parties of this way, by reason of the esteem they have of darkness; wherein they being ignorant of God's Righteousness, how in their blind zeal do they go about to establish their own wayes and righ∣teousness, and though no better then filthy Rags? So darkness that being over people, and in the dark, cor∣rupt ways being set up, from whence sin is let into the heart, and so the soul is in bondage to corruption; the Reli∣gions being in the head, how giddy
are these Sects and Parties? turning and wheeling about, cringing and bowing at every turn, the sting of the Venomous Beast that being nourished in the heart by the unbeliever; con∣cluding where he takes place, That it is a dangerous principle to hold forth such a way that is out of sin, or to tell of per∣fection? which darkness and blindness of theirs, under many fair shews of Professions, what strange effects have been brought forth? through these many Sects and Parties, in their ways by which they are blinded, and can't see God's Way, which is Truth, in which there is no Error (therefore perfect) but for want of the know∣ledge of this, I say, what strange ef∣fects have been brought forth by the many Sects and Parties? whose strength hath been an Arm of Flesh, the which, whilst one Party hath been strongest in, how have they shown it, in sup∣pressing and keeping down the others? but giddiness being through the Re∣ligions, being in the head, a time of turning round again coming, how
hath another Party exercised the same power, and so one after another? A corrupt fountain of Imaginations and Inventions being opened amongst Apostates from the Truth: How in this night of darkness hath Envy, Ma∣lice and Hatred run currently, and drove Meekness, Holiness and Truth quite out of doors? so the way of Truth that having been out, the Com∣mandment that was given forth in the way of God, To love him above all, and one another, that hath been out; the Sects and Parties having been blinded through sin, in that blind So∣domites estate, how have they (who have had the Names of Christians) been groping and feeling for the door which lets into Peace? but let them bring forth their experiences after twenty, fourty, sixty years Tryal, some more, someless; and don't think to cover your selves any longer with telling what you read of others ex∣periences, whilst you are resisting the just pure gift of God; for a day of search is come, and coming: So
Wo to them that cover, but not with God's Spirit. So all you Blind Guides, who are leading the blind, you must needs fall into the pit of destruction together, if you do not repent of your evil in refisting the just principle of God in you. So do not think by your twining and twisting in your wise definitions or distinctions about evil, whilst you put good for evil, that you shall mend the matter thereby; for good is good, and that's of God, from whence all good comes; and evil is evil, and that's of the Devil, from whence all bad comes: So plain-deal∣ing is a Jewel, which many Honest hearts have sought for, and have wait∣ed on God to be seasoned therewith, which makes savoury in his sight who is Creator of all, a Mighty power over all, whom all the Ministers of Christ turned People to, that they might not continue in darkness, nor under Sa∣tan's power; but that they might know his Light, who hath all Power
in Heaven and Earth, and so to live subject under this higher Power, by which Power the true eye comes to be opened; and by a true under∣standing is witnessed God's love to the World in his Son Christ Jesus, and what manner of love that was in that Blessed Act, in Suffering without the Gates of Jerusalem; so in the same Will, which was the Sanctifier of Be∣lievers, Believers now are sanctified and cleansed from evil, to make men∣tion of the Name of the Lord in Truth and Righteousness, in which there's no Evil. So let him that names his Holy Name depart out of evil, least the good Spirit of God leave striving with him, and so the soul be sealed down in evil, where Tribulation and Anguish will never have an end. Come therefore be awaken'd, I be∣seech you, unto Righteousness, and repent with that repentance never to be repented of, in ceasing to do evil: And let the example of Nineveh be before you, Jonah 3.8, 9, 10. Cry mightily
unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands; who can tell if God will turn, and repent, &c. And God saw their Works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had said, that he would do unto them, and he did it not. So this by the way; Fast as long as you will, Pray as long as you will, Cry as loud as you will, if evil be not turned from, all will be vain: So evil, that is within man, and God's love hath been to make it manifest by the light of his Spirit within; so man be∣ing convinced of, and reproved for evil, if he heeds not reproofs, but perishes in his evil, then his destructi∣on is of himself; but if through this love of God, shed abroad in the hearts of people, they be awaken'd thereby, and so cleave to the good, and follow and obey it, then will that which was a Reprover for Evil, be an Instructer in a Blessed Life, where sin
nor evil can't enter (nor be) neither is there any agreement with darkness in that life in which there's no evil; but the soul being in this liberty, then, Come, I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my soul; and my soul, and all that's in me praises the Lord. So here's the Blessed Fountain opened, where the streams of God's love are felt to run, which drive back the streams of malice, uncleanness and abominations, which have corrupt mankind. So Blessed are they whose Eyes are to the Living Fountain, and wait for the rising of the springs thereof in their hearts, from whence the truly thirsting soul comes to be satisfied, refreshed and strengthened, through a true sense of the springing up of this Well of Water, which he gives who hath all power in Heaven and Earth; the which Well of Wa∣ter springing unto everlasting life, all being dipped or plunged under this, the soul comes to be washed from cor∣ruption: and so made white as Snow; the which is an everlasting ordinance,
ordain'd of God for a perpetual Co∣venant; the which all that would know Salvation through the remissi∣on of sins, they must wait to be con∣firmed in this Blessed Covenant, where the Blessed Unity stands out of sin; for there's no evil in this Covenant: So all that come to be concerned here, must first agree in their hearts to cease from sin and evil, and then to wait for the rising of the Pure, and so to watch in the Pure against all appear∣ances of that which is corrupt, and so to grow up in the Pure to a Blessed Do∣minion over the corruptible; and so in the pure measure of God's Spirit to receive and use the Creatures of God with Thanksgiving, where every Creature is good when they are so received: so to the Pure all things are Pure; but to the Defiled and Un∣believing there is nothing Pure: So the way of God, that is Pure and Un∣defiled; and Blessed are they who are Undefiled and keep (and are kept) in that Blessed way to finish their dayes, where the Soul rests in Peace
with God, the which is the will of God (according to which is this writ) So to him be glory and honour, from the rising of the Pure of himself, for∣ever and for ever, Amen. By a Servant of the Lord, Stephen Smith.
THE BLESSED WORKS OF THE Light of God's Holy and BLESSED SPIRIT Exalted above the works of Darkness. COme, sit down together in a deep Silence out of all fleshly Wisdom, forgiving all Tres∣passes; that he that sits upon his Throne, who said, behold I make all things new, that he may forgive all your Trespasses; and then wait for acceptance into Gods pure holy Co∣venant, his holy Law in the Mind that it may be writ in the Heart, and they shall not teach every man his Neighbour and every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the
greatest; for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and ini∣buities will I remember no more; A blessed day, magnified be the Lord, whose Works praise him for ever (and not good works out of wicked workers mouths) to these mighty works of the mighty God, the which he is working and bringing to pass through his mighty power, are appointed that mankind should live in the enjoyment of them, to the praise and honour of his Maker for ever. And that it may be distinguished between evil workers who have got the good words, and the good works, from whence all true and good and gracious words came, (observe.) In one of the Collects appointed in the Book of Common Prayer, it is thus written, Almighty and everlasting God, which of thy tender love towards man, hath sent our Saviour Christ Jesus to take up∣on him our Flesh, and to suffer Death upon the Cross, that all mankind should follow the example of his great Eumility,
mercifully grant that we both follow the example of his Patience and be made partakers of his Resurrection, &c. Now mind; To pray for this, that is common, and used in the old World of Transgression, where iniquity and sin is, which separates from God, and are out of his Blessed Work: But to be in the Humility and Patience, this is God's Work, where his Will is done on Earth as it is in Heaven: So that if people would but so far condescend to the Will of God, as to sit down in coolness in a true Silence of all the works of the fleshly wisdom, would they not agree with us, who are in Scorn called Quakers, in Judg∣ment at least, though it may be not in Practice, viz. That Words with∣out Effects, are as Dreams and Chass, (to the Wheat, the Substance.) So he that hath a Dream, let him tell his Dream; but he that hath Gods Word let him speak it: What is the Chaff to the Wheat? Is not my Word like a Fire, saith the Lord, and like a Hammer, that breaketh the Rock in pieces, Jer. 23.
I am against the Prophet, saith the Lord, that steals my Word from his Neighbour, who use their Tongues, and say, he saith, and Prophesie false Dreams, and tell them, and cause people to err by their Lyes and Lightness. And so now in Coolness, when the works of the ene∣my are down, viz. Prejudice and Pas∣sion, &c. Then by a little work of God, in its least appearance, by which mankind is made sensible, they may see by this small distinction what it is that we, who are in Scorn called Quakers, stand for, (and against:) And when the Eye of your Understanding is opened, to behold his glorious works whom you have pierced; then will you love us, whom so many have hated, because of our Testimony of God's Works. Do but see how you first ha∣ted the Light of God in your selves, before that great Darkness came over you to hate us, who are called Qua∣kers, because we are bowed unto Christ's Spirit, the true Christians Spi∣rit, and therein have in some mea∣sure partaken of his Cup, out of which
some indeed have drunk very deep, even to the following of his great Hu∣mility and Patience, even to Death, as in the New-England Sufferings may be seen (by those cruel imaginary Christians, whose wicked hands have been deep in the shedding of Innocent Blood. And though through Igno∣rance the Sufferings of God's people hath been much in Old-England, yet they have not been in that desperate kind as there; where doubtless they are more drunk with the Whores Cup of Sorceries and Witchcraft, then those of that kind are here in Old-England, whose spirit is felt; but that their Wings are cut, so cannot fly at that rate, which otherwise they would be at; for now their Hands are tyed, how wonderfully do their Tongues go? by which its plain they have no Bridle, but are set on Fire of Hell, wondering, despising and fretting against the work of the Lord in this the day of his power, though thou∣sands are raised by it, to declare and publish the same words, in life and conversation, &c.
And now you vain and empty Pro∣fessors and Notion its, who are saying in your dark and imaginary conceiv∣ings of things; that if you had been in the Scribes, and Pharisees dayes, you would not have done as they did: But come, be patient a little; the works of Truth have a good tendency, though they be bitter to the guilty for the present; come I say, look where you are; by the Light you may see; you must see by it at last; it were better for you if you would let your Eye be opened now, and see that of∣fensive Eye pulled out which hath been offended at God's works all this while: So do not harden your hearts in this day of God's power being ma∣nifest, least you be cut off from his rest for ever. Come therefore you that are judging others that did wickedly in their Generation, by resisting God's holy Spirit, so had none of the works of Revelation; come see now what Latitude your works are under: If you be in the same liberty in the flesh as you were in, its no matter what you
say: Come now to the Tryal; what experience have you of the operation of God's Spirit? How much of the mind and will of God hath it revealed to you? Can you say, Thus saith the Lord, by the certain knowledge of the Revelation of God's holy Spirit? Or have you only talkt of it, as the Jews did, who said, we have God for our Father, when they were doing the Devil's works? Come do not stop your Ears; Have you heard the voice of God or seen his shape? or are you ig∣norant of it, as they were who accused Christ, as if he was bearing false wit∣ness? Nay, come further; Have you not said, That Revelations are ceased, and thereby shut up the way of the Kingdom of God, and from the know∣ledge of his Righteousness by your wicked works, in going about to establish your own Righteousness, and works therein for term of life. Come you that have set up the Law and Covenant without (above the Law and Covenant within; are not these your own works? and have not
they made you as blind as your Fa∣thers, the Scribes and Pharisees, that you can neither see nor hear?) but in your blind zeal are persecuting Christ's near Relations, who follow him in their Generation, even by the drawings of his Father's Spirit unto Humility and Patience, who is the way, in whom God's Will was done: And did not Christ give Testimony of Relations, his Mother, his Brothers and Sisters, who did his Father's Will? And is not this to be done on Earth? And is it not the will of God that we should speak the Truth at all times, and that we should be led and guided by the Spirit of Truth into all Truth? (is there any sin in the guide:) And is not this Christ of God the same Anoint∣ing or Teacher, as he was in the begin∣ning of the World? Was not he be∣fore Abraham was? And is not he the same yesterday, to day and for ever, as he was in the beginning, who was David's Lord, and the Holy mens Lord in all Ages? And is not he the Covenant by which all must come un∣to
God? Was he not given for a Co∣venant, and a Light to enlighten peo∣ple, and to be their Salvation, to lead and command his people? And must not his sheep hear his voice? And is not he the same that he was in the be∣ginning? And is not this the Precious tryed Stone, which the Wise Builders, building without, are confounded and stumble at, even the highest Notionists in the fleshly Wisdom, in their highest conceivings about the holy mens words? Come, examine your selves, and see whether Christ be not in you, except you be Re∣probates: You unbelievers, how hath the God of the World led you a∣bout, and blinded you, that you can∣not see the Light of his Glorious Gospel? Come see the cause; have you not been making Provision for the flesh in the first place, and answering the Lusts thereof after the glory of the old World of sin and iniquity? Hath not respect of persons been in your Eye, and filthy lucre, and praise of men, and greeting in Market-places? Have
you not preacht and prayed in your own wills, and run for gifts and re∣wards in your own wills? and is not all this Honour to be had below? And have you not sought it before the Honour of God's work in your hearts? And is not this the cause of your Ig∣norance of God's Kingdom, and his Righteousness (Christ) and his Rela∣tions, his Mother, Sisters and Brethren, who are sanctified and blest through the will of God, where it is done in Truth and Righteousness? and where that it is done, do not such confirm in truth and reality all God's Blessed and holy works without in all generations? So do not envy and hate the people called Quakers, for maintaing the works of God's holy Spirit within them; for there are many of them have been as high Talkers of the works of God in holy men without, as you are; but found not such Salvation, as to ven∣ture souls, and bodies, and estates, till we came to cease from our own labours in our own willings and runnings; and so our hearts were bowed unto
God's holy will in the deep silence of all fleshly reasonings and consultations: So by the works of God's holy and blessed Spirit the way of God came to be made manifest in us; the which is a pure, Holy, undefiled way, Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, as he was in the beginning without guile, without sin; no iniquity is in him; he that is the hope of Glory, the great Mystery made manifest in us Gentiles, who in former times, when without knowledge of him in the World, had Lords many, and Masters many, and feigned Faiths and Beliefs concerning him many and divers: But when we were given up clearly to seek the Kingdom of God, without any re∣serve of making provision for the flesh, then the New Jerusalem, God's build∣ing, came down from above, the Mo∣ther of all the Faithful, where no evil can be conceived, whose Children in her are made free from the Law of sin and death; and this blessed City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the Glory of
God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. This blessed habi∣tation is prepared for God's people, who love the Light of his appearance, and delight to do his will. So away with all false Accusations from all you false Accusers of the peo∣ple called Quakers, who say, we ex∣pect to be Saved by a righteousness of our own, and by works of our own: If it were so, as you falsly and vainly do say, then might we not keep in the broad way, with you Hypocrites, who are gotten above the dayly Cross, and so led about by the Thief above the door, where you Foxes, who are cunning in hunting about after others works, have holes enough to creep and cringe into to keep you in the glory of the World of sin and iniquity, where you have had a long Trade in your imaginations, conceiving God's works in his blessed Instruments without you, whose Lines you have long made your boast of; so your Lyes are upon your own heads. For, this I testifie, and the Testimony is the same in thousands, who are wit∣nesses
of the works of God's holy Spi∣rit, in some degree or measure, viz. That it is in Christ, God's Covenant, in which we hope for Salvation, and in no Covenant or Work of man's; and in this Covenant we are made a good savour unto God, and one unto another: And acceptance with God is obtained no other way but by the one pure offering, without spot or blemish, by the effectual workings of the Eternal Spirit, where the Blood of Christ is witnessed to be sufficient to purge Consciences of dead works, and so to serve God in the New and Liv∣ing way, which he hath consecrated for us through the Vail, his flesh: And therefore all who are thus partakers of God's works, by the Revelation of God's Spirit, being true witnesses of the Blessing of God in this one unspot∣ted offering, we cannot but confess him before men, denying all imagi∣nary offerings in mens wills, where their Garments are filled with spots and blemishes, and their Consciences are defiled with dead works of their
own Inventions and Works, the which having some outward shew of Holiness may recommend unto man, who lives in the same, but not unto God; and therefore experience in the works of God's blessed Spirit hath taught us to deny them. And by this Christ of God, the Me∣diator of the New Covenant, we have Acceptance with God, from whence the knowledge of Salvation comes, by the Remission of offences and sins; and therefore we deny all false and vain Mediatorship of vain man in his works of Conceivings and Imagina∣tions concerning this Mediator; the which is really to be enjoyed and known by the effectual workings of God's Eternal Spirit, to the Consola∣tion and Peace of Souls who partake thereof. And through the blessed Works of this blessed Spirit of God the deaf Ear comes to be opened, to hear the voice of the one true powerful Shepherd, who alone doth feed the Sheep of his Pasture with that convenient and
wholesome Food, the which causeth soundness of Heart and Mind, and therein doth he take care to preserve and keep his Sheep in a living sense of his Love and Fatherly care, who calls to his Sheep when the Lion, the Woolf and the Bear appears, and strengthen∣eth them who take pleasure in hearken∣ing and obeying his voice. So to the one Shepherd and one Fold, Testimony is given, unto whom all that are erred and strayed must return, if ever they witness deliverance from evil and pre∣servation from danger. So we deny all false Shepherds whose works of darkness tend to the scattering people in their minds and understandings from the sense of God's Works in Christ, in reconciling lost mankind, and bring∣ing them home unto himself (the sub∣stance of all) of which the Law out∣ward was but a shadow of good things the which are enjoyed in this one Shepherd and Bishop, who takes care and oversight of Souls; magnified and praised be his holy and glorious works of Redemption for ever and ever.
And so to the Honour of this one blessed Physitian of Souls, whose Works are certain and effectual, the which has been tryed by many wounded Souls, who could find no Cure without by the foolish and vain Physitians with∣out, who are meer Deceivers, and Daubers up of people through their Inchantments and Sorceries, by which they have made a long Prey of people through their fair Speeches, getting their Money through meer Deceit and Flattery, intruding into things they have no knowledge of, in which Works they are puft up above the pure holy Works of God's blessed Spi∣rit, the Revelation of which they have denyed, they in lew thereof have set up their own Imaginations and Con∣ceivings in the Revelation of their Sin∣gular exalted Spirit, the Flattery and Deceit of which having taken with people, how are Nations corrupted by it? and what Misery have these wicked Works brought into this Na∣tion? God having given signal Testi∣monies of dislike unto them by Plague,
Fire and Sword, and by many Mes∣sengers whom he hath drawn near un∣to himself by his works, by the hands of them Messengers hath he sent warn∣ing upon warning, and exhortation up∣on exhortation, with tenders of his blessed works of reconciliation upon just and equal terms, of his enemies repenting, and turning unto him by turning from their wickedness: But what Entertainment these Servants of the Living God have found by these foolish Physitians, who are meer Time-servers for their own ends, whose refuge is an Arm of Flesh to defend their wicked corrupt works, which have filled the Nations with their De∣filements, who by their Flatteries have drawn a Compliance from Magistrates, to punish the Messengers and Ser∣vants of the most high God for telling the Truth from a certain knowledge of the works of God's Spirit of Truth, and therein testifying against the works of error and darkness. But the sufferings that have been for this love of God in and through them who have
been Instruments in his hands, may through search be known; so Testi∣mony is given against them, who are in the exaltation of works without, and denying the immediate blessed works of God's holy Spirit in its Ope∣rations and Revelations of the Mind and Will of God unto wounded Souls within. And further concerning these bles∣sed works of God's righteous holy Spirit, the which are attended with Peace, unto which way many have been turned; and becanse some loiter, and are sloathful, and yet remain un∣converted of the old man's corrupt words and deeds, and therefore not fit to put on the new man, Christ Je∣sus; and some who were in the way, do turn out of it again; and some fall head-long down to Perdition: Oh! what occasion have the watchers for evil taken at this, and thereby set at nought God's works in his holy righ∣teous Spirit, and them that abide there∣in, making conclusions in their dark imaginary conceivings of the works
of God, That he hath no such perfect works now adayes; but that all are fal∣lible and changeable: And so measure and weigh the things of God in their corrupt false measure and ballance, which things are Abomination in the sight of God. So Testimony is given to God's blessed works, though many are so brittle that they will not abide them; yet notwithstanding God's works in and through his holy Spirit of Truth, are righteous, holy, perfect in every degree and measure, and remains firm in goodness, and unchangeable, there being no spot nor blemish in them, the which praises them for ever, out of which none shall ever find accep∣tance of him. Mutter, peep, whine and scold as long as you will, your works of darkness must down, which have corrupted the Nations, which is cause of the great Judgments past in this Nation, and the greater yet to come; For the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, is gone out against wicked workers and works; and thus saith the Lord, No Peace to the wicked,
their prayers are abomination in my sight. So whatsoever your professions and coverings therein be, of your talkings and imaginations concerning the gift of God, which is Life Eter∣nal, you being really out of it, in your own imaginary parts and gifts, in comprehending the works done with∣out you, and so not sensible of any real, perfect, pure work of God's holy Spirit in you, the which is the cause you are so dark, and wickedly blind∣ed to plead for sin, the which is ac∣companied with the wages of death; the cause of death being sin, the which remaining, the effects cannot cease, even death and corruption from that venomous sting over all flesh that is corrupted with it. So for shame leave your false Accusations against an inno∣cent people, called by the Name of Quakers, for testifying of the works of God's holy Spirit, the which are perfect in every degree, and therefore there is not the least sin nor evil in them. So all you who say, You are not with∣out sin in your best duties; I say, they
are all works of your own (which blind and hide God's works from you.) And as you may read of the works of God's Spirit in Mordicai, how they could not bow to the Pride and Ar∣rogance of Haman; and also, the works of God's Spirit in Daniel, how they could not bow to them that would have restrained and limited them; and also the works of Gods Spirit in Shadrach, Meshech and Abed∣nego, how they could not bow to the Golden Image, set up by Nebuchad∣nezar, though Laws under Penalties of Death in a Cruel manner was before them; and also, the works of God's holy Spirit in the Primitive Christians, through the strength of which they under-went hard and grievous things under the spirit of Antichrist, which got up in a form of good words, in the pleasures and vanities of the works of the fleshly wisdom, the which have been kept up by the same wisdom, by the Arm of flesh, under which the Inno∣cent people, who are true witnesses of the works of God's Spirit have suf∣fered
very deeply in this Age, the which cannot be hid, though the cause for which they have thus suf∣fered is so far hid that it cannot be believed, though they have been won∣derfully declared of. But it is Morde∣cai, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshch and Abednego's God, which we, who are in scorn called Quakers, do worship in and by the effects and blessed Opera∣tion of his own blessed Spirit, where∣in stands our confidence, and not in Flesh; and our Faith, Belief and Hope is in him, that he will turn the Hearts of our enemies unto us, though many will perish in their gain-saying. So over all the works and powers of dark∣ness in our Faith and Belief, that the holy righteous works of God's blessed Spirit shall be exalted, and the God of Truth in and through his blessed works, in preparing and fitting the hearts of people, the knowledge of him shall increase, till it spread over all. And for this purpose hath God raised many, contrary to the wisdom of the World, in whom he hath made
known his Righteous Works, who have unity and fellowship therein (who are true labourers therein) purely out of love to God and his blessed works, in good-will and true-love to all men, that all may taste of the goodness of God, the experience of which will bring mankind to be of one mind and heart, and therein to agree to praise and magnifie God, who shows man his Thoughts, to whom belongs ho∣nour and glory for ever. And now all you Leaders of the People, in all forms and fashions, who are denying the works of the Divine Power of God in its blessed operation and powerful workings, in setting free them who are heavy laden and weary through the enemies works of sin and iniquity, the which you say cannot be overcome; therefore you are denyers of the sufficiency of God's works and his kingdom, wherein dwells righte∣ousness, peace and joy, in and through effectual workings of God's holy Spi∣rit; the which, though you say in
words, Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done, &c. But being sayers, and not doers, you are so darkened that with all your own wills and mights you are strengthening the old King∣dom of transgression, where sin and iniquity aboundeth, the Devil's works: Was it not by reason of transgression that the first Law, the first Covenant, was added, which was written in Tables of Stone? And was not this in force till the Seed of Life and Power, the coming of the Messiah, to finish Transgression, and to put an end to Sin, and so bring in everlasting Righ∣teousness, God's Kingdom? Now all you blind Leaders of the blind, is not here God's second Co∣venant, writ in the heart, into which all must come that come unto God, where his Light is to shine, who is the True Light that enlightens every man that comes into the World? And if this righteous Law be taken heed un∣to, will it not judge Lust when it rises in the heart? And will it not judge Anger when it rises in the heart? And
will it not judge every desire of break∣ing Promise, when it arises in the heart? And will it not judge every hasty and froward Action and Light∣ness, when they appear in the heart? And is not all that proceeds from this righteous Law and Covenant of God in the heart Pure Truth, Yea and Nay? And what is more then plain Truth, Yea and Nay, is it not judged by this pure Law in the heart? And are not all fotbidden to Swear by this one Law-giver, who is able to Save or to Destroy? And must not his righteous Law and Decree take place, though many Laws through darkness and Ignorance may be made against it? And must not all that come to Sion, the City of the Living God, be re∣deemed through these righteous judg∣ments? And all that will not come under this righteous Law and Govern∣ment, where Mercy and Peace kisses, and Truth and Righteousness is set over all; is it not just that they be left to Judgment without Mercy? So is not Destruction from Self-willing and
running of people out of the counsel and knowledge of the will and mind of the living God? And is not the Sal∣vation of every Soul in and through the righteous Decrees, and just and holy Laws of God, which is Light in every Conscience? And must not all come to Salvation come first to the way and means that God hath ordain∣ed? And is not the second coming of Christ, in the Light of his Holy Spirit, the way by which all must come unto God, the which is without spot, with∣out guile? And must not all that come unto God come unto him in this one blessed savoury offering? And is not this Christ of God the same yesterday, to day and for ever as he was before Abraham was, and so the same in the beginning of all things? And must not all that come to God, come out of Transgression, the cause why man∣kind was drove from the presence of God? And is not this Christ of God the way out of Transgression, who was obedient and subject to the will of his Father in all things? And must
not they, all that are saved, be brought into this blessed Covenant of Life, the end God's great love in his Son manifested to the World, that through him they might not abide and perish in Darkness; but through believing and obeying that second coming and appearance of the Light of him, they might have the Light and Under∣standing of the Life of him, the one blessed Offering, that perfects for ever them that are sanctified? And now all you blind Leaders of the blind, under all your imaginary lifeless Confessions and Professions of God and Christ, what strength of Ar∣guments do you use in your perverse Wills and Affections to strengthen the old World of Transgression in sin and iniquity? whereby you go about with all your might to make void the second Covenant which is without fault, and so you shut up the way to God's King∣dom and the knowledge of his Righ∣teousness, by labouring and moiling in your vain service and works to establish your own Righteousness, and
dark works therein? And by this fruitless labour and travel, what dark∣ness and blindness have you brought over the Nations, through your ig∣norant Concvings of those gracious words, which were spoken by the effectual working and moving of God's holy Spirit in and through holy men, the which was for a blessed end spoken, even to turn people from the darkness, which was over them by reason of their transgression, unto the true witness in them, the Light makes manifest all that is reprovable and wicked in mankind, the which being turned from, and the Light obeyed, that they may be led to the knowledge of God, that they may not be without God in the World, whom to know is Life Eternal? And so Light is sown for the Righteous, that through this blessed Seed the Serpen's head may be bruised, and kept under in all; and so is way made to put on the Heavenly Image again, by being led and guided out of Darkness by the Light of the Emanuel, in and through
every blessed and glorious degree of his works to the mark of that price, the measure and stature of the fulness of Christ Jesus, the Heavenly Man, the Heavenly Image; as many as are baptized into Christ, put on Christ. Now I say unto you blind Leaders of the blind, who have got some few of the gracious words and works of the righteous mn of God, therefore I say but few of them, because there is but little upon record of those migh∣ty works, which did then shew forth the wonderful power of God in and by the effectual workings of his holy blessed Spirit, the which, if all had been written, the World could not have contained the Books; and of that which was written, you have but a part, with which you blind Leaders of the blind have made a long Trade, in Wresting, Perverting and Cor∣rupting to your own destruction, mak∣ing them look every way but the right in your imaginary Conceivings thereof. So wrong you are in your Judgments, who have denyed the
effectual workings of God's holy Spi∣rit, that what in you lyes by your works of darkness, you are making void God's holy Law and Covenant, as to any true understanding or know∣ledge of it in the mind and heart: And so building your selves up in Ima∣ginations and Conceivings, what strangers are you to God's holy work, in and by the effectual working of his holy Spirit within man? How bruitish are you in your understandings, to stand and wonder, and some to de∣spise, till they perish at the news of these works, though God hath raised many faithful Witnesses, who have declared and given Testimony to them, even to the laying down their Lives, and many their Liberties, and in great measure their Estates, whereby it hath plainly shewed, that this is the time and season wherein God is making known his mighty power, for the sub∣duing and bringing under the power of darkness, that the Kingdoms of this World may become the King∣doms of God; and that the Kingdom
of his Son, which is in Righteousness, Peace and Joy of his blessed holy Spi∣rit may be set over all? And is not this according to that Prayer, Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done on Earth, &c. Now consider, are not all those wayes destructive to mankind that are made up in the dark Con∣ceivings of man, without the Light of understanding the will of God here∣in? And by your works of darkness, in opposing the blessed effectual works of God's holy Spirit, what misery and consusion have you brought your selves and the Nations into, where you lye in heaps in Controversies about the works and words without, till the enemy's works of darkness be over∣grown in you, by which you are so droven from the presence of God, and the Light of his Countenance, that you are greatly confounded, kicking and stumbling at the precious stone, the which in your fleshly worldly wis∣dom you think too mean to be in your Buildings? by reason of which how many fashions are your Building
of? reeling and staggering from one fashion to another, soaring alost in your airy imaginations of the things of God, in using your Wits and Arts to bend the holy men's Testimonies to your corrupt Wills and Affections: And so much more as you strive in these works, so much more you are, and must be confounded: What a sad work have you herein taken in hand? and what vast Sums of Money have you exacted out of Nations to main∣tain the Pride and Arrogancy of your hearts herein? Oh! that there were such a heart in people to sit down before the Lord, that they may partake so much of his works as to open the Eye of their un∣derstandings, that they see over these works of darkness, where nothing is good nor pleasant to the truly hunger∣ing and thirsting Souls after God's Righteousness: How miserably have these Nations been cheated by these blind Guides, who have exacted abun∣dance of Wages under pretence of being Healers and Curers of the Na∣tions;
but are now found by the Ef∣fectual Workings of the Light of God's holy Spirit to be the chief Instruments of the letting in of Darkness, Cor∣ruption and Abominations that raign on the Earth; through that adulte∣rated Spirit, the Mother of all Harlots, who are departed from the true Spouse, and so running and hunting after o∣thers blessed works and experiences, have set up Trades in their Arts of telling and boasting of others Lives and Works, where that adulterated Spirit hath covered them, who are corrupted with her Sorceries and Witchcraft under various fashions of Confessions and Professions of God and his Christ? But underneath these coverings are the same wicked hands by which the Just hath suffered, and been rejected, and set at nought in all Ages. And through the blessed works of the Light of God's holy Spirit these corrupt workers and works of dark∣ness being discovered, and a Righte∣ous Testimony in Thousands that stand
against them; what a sad work do these blind Leaders make to hide them∣selves from the wrath of the Lamb that is coming upon them, looking back to the several Traditions, Customs and Commands of men, from whence they drive several establishments upon flesh∣ly rotten Foundations, as Covenant, and Directory, of man's, none of God's Foundation: Christ, God's Founda∣tion, is a pure, holy, unspotted Foun∣dation, where God's Wisdom and Counsel directs in and through the works of his holy Spirit, the which are perfect and good in every degree thereof, by which people are built up a Spiritual house, to the honour and praise in and through God's blessed works forever. So to God's Covenant and Works must all mankind be brought under; (that are redeemed and made alive to God;) therefore we deny the Presby∣terians Covenant and Directory, as be∣ing but a meer Parcel of Conceivings and Imaginations, which tends to hide the holy Covenant, and Foundation
of the Righteous people in Generati∣ons past, and now present in being (who were and are built upon the sure Foundation, which God hath laid, and thereon in Covenant with his righteous holy works.) And concerning your Foundation, who are built upon a Church-Faith, made up by an Assembly of Diviners out of their own Brain, in the fleshly Comprehensions; its man's work, full of blemishes and spots (and not God's,) God's Foundations and Works there∣on are pure and holy, without spot, wrinkles or blemish. And forasmuch as your made up Faith and Works tend to the making void the pretious Faith of God's Elect, which is the gift of God, the which purifies the heart, and works by love, and giveth victory over the old World of Trans∣gression and sin, without which there is no pleasing God: And so to this one Faith, one Baptism, and one Lord, Testi∣mony is given, and against all feign∣ed Faiths, the works of men's hands,
the which are in wickedness, by which the Just was slain. And concerning that head of the Beast, which is branched out into se∣veral Horns in feigned Humility and Will-worship, intruding into things which they are not led into by the Light of God's holy Spirit, and there∣fore their Foundation being not from a certain knowledge of the immediate works of God's holy and blessed Spi∣rit in them; But are in their own wil∣lings and running into Imaginations and Conceivings about the Practices of the holy men of God; but being out of their Spirit and Works therein, what dark works of plungings and dippings in outward Water, and ima∣ginary fellowships in outward Ele∣ments; but being out of a true sense of the works of God's Spirit, and its inspiration to enlighten them, and give them an understanding of the Times and Seasons of the Dispensati∣ons and Works of the mighty God; what strangers are they to the New Birth, and the one Baptism of Christ
with Fire and the holy Spirit, to burn and consume Lusts, and so to bring down every high Thought and vain Imagination under his Feet, who is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World? And so by that one pure holy Spirit of God are many bap∣tized into one Body, where God's will is done on Earth by him that abides forever. So not by the works of man, is any saved, but by the merciful works of God in his Son, by the washing of Regeneration, and re∣newing of the holy Spirit. So into this pure holy Name must all be bap∣tized, dipped, plunged, the which tends to the bringing out of all false Fellowships, into that one and only Pure Fellowship, to walk in the Light of the Lord, where the Blood of Christ cleanses from all sin: A pure Baptism indeed, a pure Washing in a pure Foun∣tain, where filthiness that is within man comes to be washed away, and thereby way is made for the comfor∣table fresh springs that rise from the Fountain of Love and Mercies, (the
Substance,) of which many outward things are shadows; but the good thing it self is come, glory to God on high, (Heb. 9.9, 10.) So to this blessed work, who must increase, his Testi∣mony is given; and against all the works of men's hands, the which tend to the making void thereof. So the Fountain of God stands sure, and must do forever; and all false foundations, whereon people have built, must be swept away for evermore. THe blessed and unspotted Foun∣dation the mighty God of Hea∣ven and Earth hath laid, which is Christ, or Ʋnction from the holy God, by the Light and Teaching of which mankind comes to be inspired with an understanding concerning things that disser; even that which is precious and wholsome, so good for Food for every Soul; and that which is vile and filthy, which tends to the defiling and
bringing Souls into bondage. And so John in his 1 Epist. 2.20. saith unto the then Believers, who had received this Heavenly Gift: But ye have an Ʋnction from the holy One, and ye know all things: Herein was, and is God's Love in his Son manifested to the World, to destroy his works, who hath led mankind into Darkness; and so through man's obedience in fol∣lowing and believing in these blessed and unspotted works of God in his Son, the enmity comes to be slain, that separates mankind from God, and so the blessed works of God in his Son, reconciling and bringing back them who have been lost by wander∣ing and roving in their own willings and runnings in this cloudy and dark night, they come to be seen, felt and enjoyed by them who were and are partakers thereof, even of God's works in his Son, by which the eye of the understanding comes to be opened, and so the offensive eye, that is of∣fended at God's works, comes to be put out: And thus the Light and Un∣derstanding
of that pure Life comes to be known, the which hath been as a Lamb slain from the Foundation of the world of wickedness by the sub∣tilty of the Serpent in mans heart. And now to the praise and honour of God Almighty, who hath drawn thousands by the strivings of the grace of his holy Spirit to the know∣ledge of his way, Christ, the Truth, Way and Life, the which is without spot and blemish, the same pure, ho∣ly and unchangeable Way and Foun∣dation on which the holy men of God were built in Ages and Generations past, Ephes. 2.20. and are built upon the Foundation of Apostles and Pro∣phets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-Stone. So here was the Primitive Christians Foundation, from whence proceeded and proceeds Hea∣venly, blessed and gracious words, from the true sense and feeling of the operation and powerful works of God's holy and blessed Spirit: And from this holy, uncorruptible, pure Foundati∣on and way of God were all true Mi∣nisters
and Teachers of others raised, from the blessed operation of the Spi∣rit of Truth in themselves, whereby they had and have the Will and Mind of God unto People, though not all in the same measure or degree: But every one being faithful to his own measure of knowledge, is therein a Minister of the universal love of God in his Eternal Spirit unto the World. So here lyes the difference between true Teaching and Teachers, (and false.) The true Teaching being the anointing of God's holy Spirit and Power, wherewith mankind being anointed, and taught of God, and ac∣cording to God's blessed will therein, in a cross to his own Carnal Will and Affections, speaking forth and de∣livering the Truth unto people, as it is in Jesus Lord of all, in whom the Peace is, and from whom Peace is proclaimed under those Conditions and Qualifications as it pleases him to make and tender, who is Lord of all. The false Teaching is that Spirit of Iniquity, the old Deceiver of the
World, the Serpent that worked and wrought under a Mystery, subjecting mankind unto his will under a vain hope, through which he beguiled him at first, drawing out a Compliance of his Will unto his delusions, and so to transgress the blessed commands of his Maker; through which yielding of mankind unto the Serpent's Coun∣sel, they became Transgressors of God's holy Law and Covenant; and for that cause was drove from God's Presence, and then Fear entered; and Trouble and Sorrow entered by man's yielding to the Traytor, by which means he partook of the Nature of his Cursed works; and being thus drove out of the Garden of Eden, the Lord placed a Flaming Sword, which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life. And now the same Mystery of wick∣edness, by which mankind was drawn into Transgression, the same spiritual wickedness got in a high place, above the pure Seed of God in man, there keeps mankind in bondage to his will
under many fair and specious hopes, That though sin and transgression, (the cause of death,) be not finished in them, yet deliverance shall be had by the ma∣nifestation and works of the Seed with∣out them. So here mankind being Im∣bondaged by these corruptible works under the dark power of the enemy, from whence arises all corruptible ways, man being gone from the up∣rightness in which he was created, goes now abroad hunting about in his Inventions and Conceivings, being led about by this Thievish Spirit, which first drew his mind from the will of God, and so in this is climing up and down, every way but the right door; and so being in this Earth∣ly wisdom from below, by Arts and Trades set a teaching of their Imagi∣nations and Conceivings concerning the holy works without, and so here lay down Foundations under Confes∣sions and Professions of good works and gracious words without, and thereby keep the Serpent's works of transgression and sin alive within; and
here the false Teachers under several covers of Confessions and Professions in the spirit of Antichrist set up. And so here being tossed up and down in floods of Inventions, from thence their shameful works are cast up in the old World of transgression and sin, where these false Teachers are so rivited, the works of the Enemy being become so natural unto them by reason of the continuance of time in transgression and sin, that thereby they are now become impudent and bold, even to dare to plead for the Serpent's works, (sin,) for term of life; taking it for de∣lusion and high presumption for any to speak to the contrary: And so here false Teachers being raised from the works of the enemy, moving in the Earthly wisdom for Earthly things, be∣ing propt and bolstered up through vain glory, praise of men and weigh∣ty Pounds, many Nobles and special Marks, with abundance of Crowns, and frequent appearances of Angels; in and by which they are so oyled, that their Tongues run at their own
Wills and Lusts, by fair Speeches of other mens Lines and Works; with which ignoront simple people being taken, have so fed and oyled the Wheels of these Trades-men, the which hath set them up so strong, that they make all the defence they can to strengthen themselves and their Clients in the old World of sin and Iniquity: And so these false Teachers having put darkness for light, and light for darkness, what strong Pillars and props they are grown under the Devil's Kingdom and power of darkness, un∣der several heads, more that might be mentioned, being derived from one beastly power, from whence is risen several Heads, and so branched out in several Horns, the which are pushing every way against the Horn of God's Anointing (the power and strength of the effectual and blessed Teachings of his holy and blessed Spirit) the door and way by which all must enter that come to be truly satisfied with God's righteousness (Christ) the same Seed promised in the beginning to bruise
the Serpent's Head; the effectual works and power of which, according to God's good pleasure, was and is ma∣nifest in the World. So to the praise and honour of God's holy works many can say, Peace from him that is, and was, and is to come, Jesus, Lord of all, who delivers his people from their sins. the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World; through which powerful and blessed works of mercy and Peace is extended to all mankind, without respect of persons, upon Earth. So blessed are they that fear God, and are found out of their own wil∣lings and running in their perverse and crooked nature, in a true sub∣mission and obedience to the righte∣ous works of God's righteous holy Spi∣rit, the true Christian Spirit, that Chri∣stianity may flourish again, and that Heathenism and Paganism under that name Christian may be subdued, and vanish away; and Jesus Lord of all, exalted in the hearts and minds of peo∣ple over all his enemies: Then shall
the Nations flourish, and yield Fruit in Season, to the praise and honour of God forever. ANd now all you Merchants of Ba∣bylon, Howl and Cry, Alas! alas! What! all these precious Trades, where∣by we have gotten so much Gain, must they all down? Where be all our Moun∣tains and Rocks, that have been so long a making up by all our Fellow-Trades∣men by Arts and Inventions, in Pro∣fessions and Confessions of good works and words without, through Ages and Gene∣rations past? Will none of these Moun∣tains and Rocks cover and hide us from the great wrath of the Lamb? What must we now bow to his righteous works who takes away the sins of the World? or else will ye grant us no Peace? Alas! alas! what clothing in Scarlet, and and Purple, and Fine Linnen of Egypt, with precious Stones, will these no longer hide our sins and iniquities? Must all
our works herein, wherein we thought to have established our own righteousness, must they now all be put off as dung and dross? Alas! alas! though we have lived so far from the knowledge of the operation and works of God's Spirit, as utterly to deny its Revelations now adayes, and so have been dark, and void of the knowledge of God's righte∣ous chastisments, and rebukes therein; yet we have presumed, that by custom of Confessions and Professions of God's good works, done in and through holy men without us, would have given us a right to his holiness, thou the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, the pride of life and friendship of the World had never been wholly subdued in us, but in such a part as might be consistent with our gain and profit in the World. But alas! alas! our coverings be too narrow, they will no longer hide us; God's righteous works are abroad in the Earth, who is in∣spiring his people with true Light of un∣derstanding; and Mordicai sits in the Gate, and will not bow to wickedness (Haman.) Alas! alas! we have twin∣ed
and twisted about through many Crafts and Inventions, some of our best Arts∣men having called the Light a Devil, some others a Natural Light, and others a Bewildering Light; and likewise many false Accusations have we raised, with Evil Reports, Scornings and Re∣proachings of the people called Quakers, for Confessing to the Works of the Light of God's holy Spirit; yet all our shifts do not at all help us, but those works prosper, and they are generally a faith∣ful people to their Testimony. Alas! alas! who would have thought our Mother would have been such a Harlot? What delicate Inchantments and Sorceries hath she used and trained us up in, that we have been thus deceived, and thereby have been Instruments of deceiving the whole Nations? Alas! alas! we can fly into no Corner nor Hole but we are found, out and pursued. Alas! alas! can't all the Wisdom of the World, and Arts therein help to hide our sins and Iniquities from the Light of the Lamb? Is every Creature so manifest in his sight, that made all things good in the begin∣ning?
And is he now at work again? And must all yield to his works, or be ac∣counted his enemies, and be cast out of his presence, who is Lord of all, whose is the Earth and fulness thereof? Alas! alas! words of repentance of sin will not serve now; there must be a true repen∣tance and forsaking sin and evil, or else we perish forever. Even so must it be done to you workers of iniquity, who have been and are as props and pillars, strengthen∣ing the Old World of Transgression in sin and iniquity, the Devil's works, and therein withstood the sufficiency of God's love manifested to the World in his Son to destroy the Devil's works, which works of Transgression the old subtile Serpent, the deceiver of the Nations, in and through his Instru∣ment, is striving and labouring to main∣tain under several and very large and specious pretences of crying out, Lord, Lord: But come workers of iniquity, these good words will not give you admittance into the Kingdom of God; its not they that say, Lord, Lord, shall
enter therein; but they that do the Will of God; And was not his Will manifested to the World in his Son, that they that believed and followed him in doing his Father's Will might not perish, but have everlasting Life? And do not many of you confess to this in words? who say in your Prayers, That we may follow the example of Christ's Humiliation and Patience, that we may attain to his Resurrection, &c. What brave words have you workers of iniquity got in your Old Bottle, that can hold none of the New Wine? And so in your corrupt wills what will the using good words do you good, but thereby add to your Condemna∣tion, who by good words, and corrupt, and bad actions are withstanding, and have withstood the good will, pleasure and love of God in his Son to the World. So your works of Darkness and falshood are clearly manifested, and you can't hide them from the Light: But the Light of the effectual and powers works of God's holy Spirit, wherein his Will is manifest, is rising
more and more, to a more perfect day of his will being done upon Earth, to the praise and honour of his blessed and holy Name, whose works are Pure, Holy, Just and Perfect in every degree thereof, and tend to the true Refor∣mation, Peace, Prosperity and Estab∣lishment of all mankind in God's love and mercy therein forever. So worshipped be God that made Heaven and Earth, and the Foun∣tains of Waters, and all things there∣in, who fills the hearts of the upright with joy and gladness, through the shinings forth of the light of his Coun∣tenance, who sits upon his Throne and saith, Behold I make all things New, (Amen.)
ANd now unto such who are in doubt, Whether God's holy Spirit doth so effectually work now adayes as in the Primitive times. Unto you I say, what flesh could ever have indured such grievous and continued Punish∣ments in Tryals of divers sorts, by Imprisonments, and Banishments, and Hangings, and Killings, as in New-England (and Imprisonments to Death and spoiling of Goods) in Old-England, and Cruel Mockings, and Scoffings and bloodshed by unmerciful men? In∣deed some in a voluntary humility have somewhat appeared in Sufferings, but being in their own willings and runnings and works therein, how have they been overcome, their strength being an Arm of Flesh, as well as others, and so fleshly works have been overcome by fleshly works? But it is not so with them who are in scorn and derision called Quakers, be∣cause
they have bowed to God's way, the which is quite different to man's wayes, was that name given; but in God's way hath his Arm been reveal∣ed, and its strength made manifest in our weakness: So that to the praise of him that lives forever the operation of his blessed Spirit is felt, as in the primitive dayes; and the glory and comfort of it hath ministred strength and refreshment in the time of tryals; though this way of proceeding hath been hid from the vulterous evil Eye. So to the praise and glory of God is Confession made through the opera∣tion of his holy Spirit, through which thousands have been preserved and kept from bowing to the seed of Cain, Haman and the Beast, which hath made the World as a Wilderness, where wild Fruits and wild Actions spring. So we can truly say, to the praise of God, let not the wise men in the wis∣dom of this World glory in their wis∣dom, nor the strong men in their strength, nor the mighty men in their might; but let all wait in that pure
measure of the Light of God's Spirit in their Consciences, that by it they may draw near unto God, that they know his blessed works of mercy, and love, and judgment in the Earth, where∣in that true glory and honour of God is. ANd further, concerning Ministry, this I say; as the blessed works of the Light of God's holy Spirit has place in hearts, and so opens under∣standings, a discovery will be made from thence of the false, corrupt and and wicked Ministers, who open their Mouths for Gifts and Rewards, from whose works in fair and deceitful Speeches Prophaneness is gone out in∣to the World, where the Revelations of God's holy Spirit is denyed and set at nought; they telling people, Reve∣lations are ceased, they are not to be known now adayes, &c. So the sight of all the good and blessed works of
God's good and holy Spirit are be∣come as a Sealed Book, so that they who have exalted their parts and knowledge in Hebrew, Greek and La∣tin above the pure Life of Jesus, they can't read in it, because it is sealed; and these Learned men (unlearned in the things of God) can't read in it, because they draw near to God with their Mouths, and seem to honour him with their Lips, but their Hearts not being right in his sight, there∣fore are the wisdoms confounded, and understanding in the Things of God kept from them. So its such who have nothing to Minister from but a divination of their own Brain, in conceivings and ima∣ginations concerning the works of God in others, but from no know∣ledge of his works in themselves; so they run and Divine for Money, and Gifts and Rewards in that adulterated whorish Spirit, which hath sate a long time, and reigned over people, who have been as unstable and unsettled as Waters, reeling and staggering to and
fro through the Sorceries and Witch∣craft of that whorish wicked spirit, into which Cup the Kings of the Earth have drunk, and been made drunk with Envy, Malice and Hatred one against another; and from Lusts, which have been conceived in that wicked and untimely womb, have proceed∣ed Wars, and Fighting, and Hatred one against another, and also hatred against the appearance of God's good works in others. So its against that bad and wicked spirit, which is not to speak in the Church, that I am moved to give Testi∣mony in and through the operation of God's good and holy spirit, the which is mightily at work this Day, wherein his power is made manifest to destroy the Devil's works, and so a way mak∣ing for the pouring forth of God's holy and blessed spirit more and more upon all flesh; from whence I believe there are at present hundreds of Able and Gifted Ministers in this Nation, in some degree or measure or other of God's holy spirit, who can speak ex∣perimentally
of what they have felt, handled, tasted and seen of his works thererein, who is the beginning and ending of every good and perfect work and gift, in and for them, who wait to know his will and do it: And through these blessed works must the wounded and distracted Nations be healed and set to rights; and all that hinder these blessed works of God's holy and un∣limited spirit, they are enemies to God, and to their own souls, and to the Na∣tion and Country where they live. So to that of God in every ones Con∣science I appeal in these weighty and high concerns, wherein I have done the will of God, I rest The 9th. day of the 4th. Month, 1673 A Lover of the Truth, wherein I seek the good of all Mankind. Stephen Smith.
NOw unto you who say, I write out of Enmity: Therein you say true; for in the true Enmity, which God hath put between the two Seeds, viz. The blessed Seed of the woman, and the Cursed Seed of the Serpent: So that in that which is truly good, that blessed Seed by which evil is overcome, ac∣cording to the good-will of God, in that I give Testimony against that which is corruptible and bad, by which mankind is led away into darkness, and there captivated under the ene∣my's power. But if any shall say, I wish herein any ill to any one's person: I do say in the Truth and Uprightness of my heart, that such do falsly accuse me; For I know in the blessed Seed Inter∣cession is made through me and many thousands, that Light may rise in them who sit in darkness, that mankind, who are dead in trespasses and sins,
may be quickened, and raised into the glorious freedom and liberty in the Son of God, where we may live to∣gether in Peace with God and one with another, to the praise and glory of his holy Name forever. Stephen Smith.
A Trumpet sounding in the Ears of all Persecutors, to awaken them out of their dead sleep, in which they have taken Prey from the Innocent; who have made themselves drunken with Malice and Envy; and so, Nabal-like, are saying, What are these, that we should re∣gard them, &c. COme Persecutors, Awake, A∣wake, hearken how the Cows and the Oxen Low in your Ears; when you lye down to sleep, doth not their Lowing trouble you? And when you rise, are not you tor∣mented at the noise of their Lowing? sleep as secure as you can, you will be awakened at last; and then the
noise of the Lowing of Cows and Oxen will sound in your Ears: In your lying down, in your rising up; in your Eating and Drinking; in your going about your business; it will be a dread∣ful noise, when the cause of the In∣nocent, whom you have wronged, comes to be laid before you. Come Persecutors, Awake, Awake, hearken; do you not hear the Bleat∣ing of Sheep, which have been taken from Innocent people, for keeping the Commands of Jesus? stop your Ears as hard as you can, they will be open∣ed at last; and heir Bleating will be so loud sounded in your Ears, that you cannot avoid the terrible noise thereof. Come Persecutors, Awake, Awake; hearken what a dreadful noise is a∣mongst the Pots, Kettles, Skillets, Frying-pans, Dripping-pans, Pewter∣dishes, Flaggons, Chamber-pots, &c. the which have been taken from an In∣nocent people, for keeping their Con∣science void of offence towards God and man; that men take offence against
the Innocent, when no proof can be made thereof; that is the steps of the wicked in all Ages: But hearken Per∣secutors, sure you are not so fast a sleep, but that you may hear the rat∣ling of these things in your Ears; well, they will make a fearful noise at last. Come Persecutors, Awake, awake; open your Eyes, they will be opened at last, and then the Beds, Cloths, Corn, Hoggs, Horses, Butter, Cheese, Ba∣con, and all sorts of Commodies taken from Tradesmen, out of their Shops, and working Instruments from poor people, Shoe-Leather, and abundance of other things, too long to name; all taken from an Innocent harmless people, who seek the good and well∣being of all men: At last all these things shall be laid before your Eyes, you shall not be able to shut them against them, nor to stop your Ears, from the several dreadful noises; but they must sound in your Ears, and you must know, that all these doings proceed from a corrupt rotten heart and mind, which is abhorred by the living God.
And now after all the spoil, that hath been made on the Goods and Persons of an innocent people, many of whose bloods have been shed in your Streets, witness Horsly-down meet∣ing: After all this, the matter of Fact which the Innocent people, called Quakers, have been accused of, it hath not at all been prov'd against them; neither hath there been any cause of a ground given to suspect their Meetings to be any wayes tending to Sedition, &c. They have been al∣wayes peaceable on their parts; and therein the peace and well-being of all hath been sought? When you are awakered, and the Book opened wherein your wickedness is recorded; then will the Meetings of the People called Quakers, appear unto you as aforesaid. And so all you, who are wondering at a peoples standing still in Silence to wait upon the Living God, to receive Counsel of him, that by the same they may be guided in the way and path of Life: would it not be good if all would do the same?
And not run forward in Satans Coun∣sels, in envy, hatred, and malice, till you come to be bitten and devoured, one of, and by another: What is it the near to have the names of Chri∣stians, when there is none of Christs Spirit or Nature in you. Be not de∣ceived, the Living God will not be mocked; though in his tender mercy, he hath yet spared many Vials of wrath and hath not poured them forth, but instead thereof he hath caused many to go out in dread, and fear, to testifie of his good will, upon repen∣tance and amendment of life, but that love having been slighted, the con∣trary will come heavy at last; and then your courage and valour which you have exercised against an inno∣cent people, that will fail you, and fear, and trembling, and amzement, that will seize upon you. Brambles and Thornes, whose nature is to Tear and Rend, cannot stand against a consum∣ing Fire. Come, hearken all that have a Fin∣ger in this Dish; have you not be∣trayed
your Master? are you not cal∣led Christians? and should not Chri∣stians have all one Master? Did not the name of Christian come by him who is Master of all, and hath all power in Heaven and Earth? and was it not given to them who came out of the Heathenish nature, who came under the power, which was manifest to de∣stroy the works of the Devil, and the nature of the Devil's power, which is to Rend, Tear, and Devour; com∣ing in Troops, as he did upon Jobs Goods, in Troops of Caldeans, and Bands and Troops of Sabeans? So have not you, who are in the same works now, as the Sabeans and Cal∣deans were then (in spoiling the Goods of Innocent men, who love that which is Evil? have you not betrayed your Lord and Master, having given your selves up to serve a wicked Ruler, he that is Prince of the power of darkness, who hath his rule in his Servants, who are departed from their obedience to him who is Lord and Master of all, and ought to be served and feared by
all; since there is no blessing, nor any thing that is good, but what is of him, and from him, who created all, and upholds all, who is Lord of all, blessed for ever. Come, be awakened, and hearken; where do you find (by the example or Doctrine of Christ Jesus, who is Lord of all, and hath all power in Heaven and Earth,) or do you read of any such works afore-mentioned, done by him or his Followers? No, no, you have betrayed him, who call him Lord, and yet live in such works of malice and revenge; he taught, and teaches quite contrary, even to learn of him, who is meek and lowly in heart, admonishing all to love one another, and to do good for evil, and to love enemies; who dwell with them that are of a contrite and humble spirit, who teaches the humble and meek, and who wash∣eth and cleanseth his Followers from their filth, as in dayes past, so to day and for ever. Oh you betrayers of him, who have rendred him a hard Master, in that you deny him; for he
is righteous, just and true, and gives power to them that receive him, and obey him patiently, to bear the re∣proaches, of the wicked, and to un∣dergo their cruel mockings, and scof∣fings and spoilings, till his pleasure is to plead the cause of the Innocent, who have no Arm of Flesh, nor Car∣nal weapon; but their trust is in him who is Lord of all, unto whom all Tongues must confess, and every Knee must bow; though for a while, the wicked, with their Ruler the Devil, may be loose, he must be chained at last, and cast into the Lake of Fire, where their part and portion will be, who continue serving him (a sad Bar∣gain.) So all you betrayers of the just, holy principle of Light and Life in your hearts, be awakened; come, see what a Dream you have been in, and what Dreamers you have followed, who are out of the way of the Lord, and yet for lucre sake, by art and po∣licy, keep people confessing they are out of the way of the Lord, perswa∣ding its not to be found, or as if there were no such thing.
Oh, be awakened, and see what a Dream you are in, and what silly Dreamers these are, who have put from them Christ, the way of Truth and the Life, by which all that ever come to God, it must be by him, whom many have found, so cannot but confess him before men, there be∣ing no other way out of Evil, and which brings and leads to peace; this is a perfect way, and tryed way, into which no unclean person, nor envious person can come into; he must for∣sake his Envy, and uncleanness, and all the Devils works, if ever he comes there. Come, don't stop your Ears, and shut your Eyes, it will be all in vain; for he that is Lord, Master and Crea∣tor of all, sees and beholds all, you can hide nothing from him, and he will call you to an account; then, what can the betrayers say? Oh, you whose dayes are not quite over, consider what you are a doing, and what you are a treasuring up; malice, envy and hatred are from a
rupt root and ground, which is cursing. Come, be awakened, cease to do evil, then learn to do well, if happily you may obtain mercy; restore the pledge and repent: Keep nothing back that hath been taken by violence. Be awakened, and see how filthy your hands are, through Malice and Cruelty, which hath brought a filthy smell and curse upon your Estates; a sad portion for your Children, for their Fathers to die with their Estates entailed in the Curse, the which can never be removed, from Father or Child, till the cause of the Curse be repented of, and done away, and so the hands wasted in innocency; until which time every one shall bear his own iniquity, because of the accursed thing that is in their hands. So out of love to Truth, and good will to all is this written, whatever construction you may make thereof, in∣to whose hands it may come; in his sight who sees all things, I am cleared, that herein I wish the good of all. Stephen Smith. The 10th. of the 8th. Month, 1670
SOME REASONS AGAINST Paying Tythes, AND Upholding that Ministry that doth Receive the same. Written in Love to the Truth, and for the sake thereof, and in Love to my Neighbours, Stephen Smith. I. CHrist Jesus he is Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth, and hath power over all flesh, by whom the World was made, who is
Heir of all things, and hath right of government in the Hearts and Con∣sciences of all people, and over all the Kingdoms of men, the right of ordain∣ing and appointing Ministers being in him, and also in giving forth his Righ∣teous Law and Commands in their Hearts, where he ought to reign, where his Ministers so ordained of him are to wait, with their Minds staid in his Light, to receive of him freely a supply of wisdom and power, and to communicate from the same freely, and to be contented with what provision the Lord is pleased to make for them; and by him there being a change of the Priesthood under that Covenant given unto Moses and the people of Israel, there is made of necessity a change also of the Law; and foras∣much as the Priests in this Age, who are not ordained of Christ, do uphold that which the Lord hath changed, therefore we do deny them, and that which they claim for their Main∣tenance.
II. These Priests being not ordain∣ed of Christ, nor appointed to that Office by him, they therefore do u∣surp that Authority, the which doth of Right belong to Christ Jesus, the which are presumptious sins, and there∣fore we do deny them. III. These Priests having denyed the Revelation of Christ's Spirit now adayes, and set up the Letter and Law without above the Spirit and Law within, by which its plain and evident, that they are Strangers to the great Love of God in his New Covenant, and being void of the knowledge of the gift of God to the World, they have nothing but Imaginations and In∣ventions of their own Brain-study, and out of others Works and Labours, therefore we do deny them. IV. They not being ordained of Christ they bring forth no pleasant Fruit, as is evident, but being or∣dained of man, being man-made Mi∣nisters, they are men-pleasers, so no Servants of Christ Jesus, but of their own Bellies, and for the sake thereof
they are abominable greedy of filthy Lucre, and therefore we do deny them. V. They being out of the way of the Lord, and strangers thereunto, therefore they can be no guides there∣in, having set up Imaginations and Devices in their own Hearts, they fol∣low them in defrauding people, there∣fore we deny them. VI. Forasmuch as Christ hath said, John 10. All that ever came before me are Thieves and Robbers, or as it may be rendred, All that go before him; (Now mind) before Abraham was he was, and before the Prophets were he was; so the true Prophets they did not go before him, they waited for the Signification of Christ's Spirit, which was in them, the which was their Foundation, and this was the Apostles Foundation, and the Be∣lievers in the Primitive time were built upon the same; but the Thieves and Robbers were the false Prophets and Priests that came before him, who steal the true Prophets words, and use
them in their Divination for Money, and Rewards, and Preaching for Hire, the which were wicked practices, testi∣fied against, and cryed out against by the true Prophets; among which wick∣ed practices we finding the man-made Ministers in this Age and Generation, who go before Christ, and being of that number Christ Jesus spoke against, therefore we deny them. VII. All take notice, that the Testi∣mony against Priests that preach for Hire is no new thing of twenty or thirty years standing, as some do vain∣ly imagine; those abominable practices were testified against by the true Pro∣phets; read Micah 3. Isaiah 66. Jer. 5. Ezek. 13. Hosea 6. and read Christ's Testimony against Hirelings, John 10. (and mind) all the holy men of God were and are of the same mind. And for Priests and People now adayes to pretend to Cospel-order and Gospel-dayes, and to live in the same, and if not worse practices then the false Pro∣phets, Priests, Teachers and People, who were before the more powerful
manifestation of Christ to flesh, the everlasting Gospel, who is the end of the Law for Righteousness to all that believe; this is a very great shame even to the name of Christianity, and the false Teachers the Priests being the Leaders into these Abominations; therefore we do deny them. VIII. Paul an Apostle of Jesus, he did exhort the then Believers, to follow him as he was a follower of Christ, who ever was, and is a blessed Leader out of Transgression, out of sin, and therefore out of Strife and Contention; he taught and teaches to love enemies, for this Cause was and is the love of God in his Son ma∣nifest in flesh, even to condemn sin in the flesh, and to destroy the Devil's works of Malice, Envy, Lust, Pride, Ex∣cess, Covetousness, Lying, Guile, Hypo∣crisie, Deceit, Fraud, Vain Worships, Vain Services, Persecution, and all other Abominations that may be men∣tioned; the true and faithful witness, even the Light of his holy Spirit in mankind, never did nor will assent un∣to
to any thing that is evil. And for∣asmuch as the Priests are led by ano∣ther Spirit, and acted by another Spirit, as by their Fruits and Practices they are manifested, even to be led by the spirit of Cain, he being the first Perse∣cutor about Religion; and the Priests being in the same steps of Persecution, they may say if they speak truly, Be∣loved, be you followers of us as we are fol∣lowers of our fore-Fathers, Cain, the false Prophets and Teachers in Ages past; they bringing forth the same Fruits, therefore of necessity they must spring from the same corrupt ground and root; and therefore let all the wise in heart judge, whether we have not good cause to deny them. IX. It hath been so from the be∣ginning, that he that was born after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now; and when we turned our backs upon ungodliness, and waited in the grace of God, that we might live godly and righteously in this present evil World, we did believe we might suffer by un∣reasonable
reasonable ungodly men, who live ex∣alted above the Grace of God, of which number the Priests are chief; and there∣fore we deny them. X. And whereas Christ Jesus, who is Lord of the Sabbath, did above six∣teen hundred years ago set up the everlasting Worship in the Spirit and Truth, and directed all to take that for their Leader into all Truth, and the Truth and blessed effects whereof be∣ing witnessed to the praise of God this day, as it was in the Primitive time. And whereas the man-made Ministers of this Age and Generation, who are not ordained nor sent of Christ Jesus, do teach for Doctrine the Commands of men, and so worship in vain, and by their Traditions and vain Customs they have excluded that Worship in Spirit and Truth, the which Christ Jesus set up; therefore we do deny them. XI. Whereas the man-made Mini∣sters now adayes do make that their Plea for their Persecution and wick∣edness, they have a Law, so said their fore-Fathers, the Scribes, Pharisees, and
Chief Priests, who Crucified Christ, they said, they had a Law; and what Perse∣cutors about Religion since Cain had not some seeming pretence and cover∣ing? though indeed these in this gene∣ration do excel in rare Arts and Cover∣ings to hide their wicked bloody Spi∣rit of Persecution under; but he is risen and come that sees through them, and teaches his Followers of them; and therefore we do deny them. XII. And we do commend the Read∣er for his full and compleat satisfaction about the ground and setting p of Tythes, since the Gospel-dayes, unto a Book Entituled, The Great Case of Tythes Revived, by Francis Howgil, who dyed a Prisoner for the Testimony of Jesus; in that Book are all Reason∣able Objections clearly answered, and there is clearly shewen, what a dark night of Apostacy was over people when Tythes were set up by a Law, and how many hundred years it was after Christ, before that gross Igno∣rance was ushered in, in making Laws to Prosecute and compel about Tythes.
And unto all we do signifie, That we have hopes in our Lord and Master, Christ Jesus, our Saviour, that he will maintain us by his Grace, and supply us out of his fulness of Wisdom and Power to live godly, soberly and righteously in this present life, giving no just Gause of Offence to any, but in all things to live an innocent harmless life, keeping our Conscience void of Offence, both before God and all men: And if any that may be among us, and profess to own our Principle, should do otherwise then right and just, let none be so rish as to condemn our just Principle, or those that live in it, because of the unfaithfulness of some that may make some Pro∣fession of it, and not live up to it: And we do pray for all in Authority, that the Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth man pour out his Spirit of Judg∣ment and Wisdom upon them, that they may be opened, and that the Nobility of their Ʋnder∣standings may be cleared from Darkness and Er∣ror, that they may discern between the Precious and the Vile, and that they may be for the Pu∣nishment of them that do Evil, and for the Praise of them that do well. The 6th. of the 1st. Month, 1676,
Wholsome Advice AND INFORMATION, In TRUE LOVE to all called CHRISTIANS; To provoke them to the Royal Law of Love, as it is in Jesus; and to the Blessed and Effectual WORKS therein. THe Lord of Heaven and Earth, who by his great power and wisdom did Create all things good, who in the beginning gave un∣to mankind Dominion over the Earth, and God blessed them, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the Earth, (and subdue it) and have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and every Living thing that moveth upon the Earth: And the works of the Lord were all good (and are all good, sa∣voury pleasant) being ordered by his universal power and wisdom, by which they were created. But mankind being fallen from the sense thereof, they have formed and fashioned many Inventions in their minds, being captivated under the enemy's power of Darkness, wherein they are become corrupt and unsa∣voury, having lost their Dominion, instead of subduing the Earth, they have let the Earth over them, and be∣ing become Earthly-minded, the things that move upon the Earth have Domi∣nion over them; and thus being cap∣tivated under the enemy's dark power, set the enemy's dark power above the power and wisdom of God, Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, by whom all things were created, who is Heir of all, by whose Power, Life
and Immortality is brought to Light; glory be to him for ever. But people being imbondaged and corrupted, they are become such slaves thereunto, and in such a ground of Infidelity, that they cannot so much as believe in God's power and wis∣dom, which is manifested to create again into its own primitive, savoury, holy Life, in Dominion over the Earth; but in the State of Infidelity, man∣kind being plunged with their nar∣row spirits they go about to measure the things of God, and in their fallen Earthly wisdom to weigh things of Eternity (and being confounded in their works) what variety of cover∣ings do people get to cover their shame in all parts of the World, as well as in Christendom (so call'd) where indeed they do greatly excel other Nations in curious Arts to make co∣verings to hide their great shame; (a miserable Trade! but very costly in in this Nation.) And forasmuch as the love of God hath been, and is largely manifested, through which many have
been, and are redeemed from that great folly and madness, in that vain travail and labour, in joyning with those Arts-men of the Times, who spend their dayes and consume abundance of Treasure in making false coverings to cover their shame; out of which confusion many being redeemed, who are baptized into Christ, and have put on Christ's beautiful Garment, and are comely in his sight, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, before whom every Creature is manifest: and because such cannot run with them in the same Ex∣cess of Riot, and pay towards the Maintenance of those Sottish Arts∣men, what a wonder they make of it! and cry to the Magistrates for help, to punish the Innocent people, for keeping their Consciences void of offence both towards God and man: What Imprisoning, even many to Death, and Spoiling, Tearing and Rending of Goods, seeking thereby the destruction and ruin of many thou∣sands of industrious laborious Fami∣lies.
A practice not so common amongst the very Turks, among whom I having lived, I did observe something of their Behaviours to the Christians and Jews that live amongst them, and one unto another; and in many common Ci∣vilities, which are called moral, in which they seemed to exceed many who are called Christians in Christen∣dom; the Christians that live amongst them of several Opinions agreeing to∣gether in outward concerns, do enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences in their several ways of Worship; and the Jews have the same freedom, the Jews observing the Seventh day, and are quiet; and the Christians the First day, and are not disturbed; and the Turks observe the Sixth day; and I did not perceive any Penalties inflict∣ed either on Christians or Jews for wor∣shipping of God as they suppose they should; but they do live quietly and peaceably one with another in these Concerns. And concerning the Turks Modera∣tion, in permitting the Christians so
quietly to enjoy their several perswa∣sion in Religious matters, I made some Inquiry, What reason they could give for the same? and thus answer was re∣turned me, thus saith Turk, In case we should go about to compel or force them to be of our Religion, fear might overcome some of them, for fear of the Punishment some may yield; and in case we should perswade them by promises of Cutward Preferment, for the Advantage sake some might yield; but (saith the Turk) when we have done all, we cannot alter or change their Belief, the which they retaining, though they may yield unto us, it would be but in Hypocrifie; and in case we should accept of them on those terms, they then would have an oppor∣tunity to do us hurt. And herein they shew more Moderation then the Apo∣state Christians in many places of Chri∣stendom. And concerning the Turks Deport∣ment, and Civil respect one unto ano∣ther, in meeting and greeting one ano∣ther; they seem to exceed the Chri∣stians in Morality; it being a cause of
Laughter unto them to see the Chri∣stians Beggarly Airy Behaviours one unto another, in Scraping with the Leg, and Doffing the Hat, and foolish Gestures, too too much used amongst many who are called Chri∣stians, who want the more solid, and more comely, and truly courteous Behaviour, which the Truth guides unto. But lest any should mistake, who do not know the difference which is amongst them called Turks, wherein I speak of the Behaviour of the Turks, as before, I do not speak of those Nests and Dens of Theeves and Robbers, who are made up of Christian Run∣nagadows, Moors and Turks; neither do I speak of the aspiring high-mind∣ed ones amongst them; but I speak of a plain people, called Turk-men, whom I have trusted much, and hav∣ing found them faithful, I perceived they had an Awe and Fear of God up∣on them, they often expressing these words [The Lord is just, and therefore we must do justly] And by occasion
having proved a Turk, I shall in brief give an Instance of his Faithfulness, where in he declared the Fear and Awe of God that was upon him: Being or∣dered by a Merchant that then lived in Aleppo, to send him up 1500 Dollers privatelely from Scanderown, where I lived; according to order, the Money being delivered, and laid upon a Horse in a Satchel, as their manner is, the Horse by Chance ran away with the Money before him, it being in a dark Night he could not find him, and in the Morning betimes the Horse with the Money was feeding at a Turk-man's Crib, the Turk taking hold of him, and feeling the Money, and seeing the Christians Mark, there being none to accuse him but the witness in him, he might clearly have kept the Money, and turned the Horse going; but the faithful and true Witness was so preva∣lent in him, that he took the Money carried it unto an Agaw; which in that place is somewhat like unto a Lord of a Manner, and after diligent search; what he had done was shewed unto me,
and the Money recovered: But mind the Awe and Fear of God that was upon the Turk, after Inquiry concern∣ing his Doings, this was his Answer; said the Turk, The Lord hath blessed me with Cattle of several sorts, account∣ing his Outward Riches; in case (said he) I should have put that Money to that which the Lord hath blessed me withall, that being none of mine, the Lord would have brought a Curse upon all that I have. Hear this O Christians, and awake to Righteousness, and don't persist in your Gain∣saying the preaching the Gospel to every Creature, Col. 1.23. lest you be cut off from the goodness of God through your unbelief and hard-heartedness; and those whom you so despise, be grafted in; (all things are possible to the power of the Lord) for of a Truth, as said Peter in ano∣ther Case, The Lord is no Respecter of Persons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness is accepted with him. So mind, it's not a bare talk of Righteousness that will
serve; and what have you more who say, Visions are ceased, and Revelations are ceased, and the Inspiration of God's Spirit is not to be known now adayes? Oh blind Apostates! what Gospel have you to preach? No; the Gospel is hid to you, in whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. lest the Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God should shine unto them: The Confession out of your own Mouthes will rise up against you in the day of account, which hastens: The midnight of it is much over you, and the day of the Visita∣tion of God's love to many of you is far spent: Do you think that your having the holy mens Testimonies of the Righteousness of God will add to your Comfort in the day of account, if you be found out of the Righteous∣ness there testified of? No; assured∣ly they will be a witness against you. The learned Scribes and the Pharisees they had the Law and the Prophets,
which witnessed to the Righteous∣ness of God (but they resisting the Spi∣rit of God) how blind and ignorant were they of the Law and Prophets! so that goodness of God they being strangers unto, through their hard-heartedness, in resisting the Key of knowledge, they were so far from the comfort thereof, that they took oc∣casion by them to resist the righteous∣ness of God; so those blessed Testi∣monies which witnessed to the righte∣ousness of God, were a witness against them for refusing the same: And for∣asmuch as the Christian-Nations have more of the holy mens Testimonies concerning the righteousness of God in the blessed operation of his holy Spirit, and do grieve it, and do de∣spight unto it, and are found in the day of account out of the life of the righteousness thereof, the more and stronger will the Scriptures of Truth be a witness against them: So then the Scriptures are profitable and comfortable, through the blessed Spi∣rit that opens them, and gives power
to live the life of the holy men record∣ed therein: But if the righteousness of God's holy Spirit, which is wit∣nessed unto throughout the Scriptures of Truth, be rejected, then will the Scriptures be unprofitable and uncom∣fortable in the day of account, when every one shall receive a reward ac∣cording to their Deeds done in the Body. Oh! that people would consider, and not go on striving against the works of the Lord, who is exalting the peaceable Kingdom of the Son of his Love, which is in righte∣ousness, Rom. 14.17. peace and joy in his holy Spirit. (Oh! its for want of knowledge that people perish) and rather then they will deny themselves, that they may have knowledge of the righteousness which is of God, they will persist and persist, and perish in their own un∣righteous Works; For the Wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God: Jam. 1.20. For the eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Prayers, 1 Pet. 3.12. but the Face of the Lord is against them that do Evil. Oh that people had a true knowledge of the Scriptures! but they do erre, not know∣ing the Scriptures, nor the power of God: The goodness and mercies of God, both in the holy Testimonies, as recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, and otherwayes manifested, should lead unto true repentance of every evil way and work, whereby God's righteous Spirit is grieved and quench∣ed. Assuredly the more God's holy and righteous Spirit doth strive many wayes with a people or Nation, and they go on, not regarding the operation of the hand of the Lord therein, but do continue to grieve and quench the blessed motions thereof, it will be more tolerable in the day of Judgment unto that People or Nation which profess less, but do more: So it's not a bare Profession and Confession, what peo∣ple do that is acceptable; but it's in do∣ing
the Will of God, through the mov∣ings of his holy Spirit, in every Nati∣on they that fear God and work righ∣teousness are accepted; and for that end, that people might fear God and work righteousness, his universal Love in his universal Spirit and power doth inlighten all mankind, whereby they may see the evil and the good; and to them that receive him in his tenders of love, he gives them power to es∣chew the evil and to love the good, of what Nation, Language or Coun∣try they be of. In the time I lived among the Turks it appeared to me, that they had more Charity and true Love one unto another, then may be found amongst many who are called Christians, who live in Error, out of God's way: Surely such Christians are driven farther from true Love one to another, and Mercy, and Patience, and Self-denyal, then the very Turks: They may be ashamed when they look back into those malicious works ma∣nifested upon an Innocent People in this Nation; I suppose they are not to
be parallel'd amongst the very Turks: And for Christendom, so called, in ge∣neral, who are apostatized from the Truth, how many Religions and high Professions there are made of God and Christ, but how little of the blessed example and humiliation of Christ is followed! Let the wise in heart take but a view of the greatest part of Christendom, so called this day, and see what works of Envy, Malice and Hatred (Evil Fruit) is shewn forth, where they seek the ruin and destructi∣on one of another; such wilde Fruit doth not proceed from Christ the Vine; no, no; such Fruit proceeds from a cor∣rupt root, which Ax of the Lord must be laid to, and it must be cut down, the word of the Lord must come over it, which must be felt a Hammer to beat down corruption, and a Fire to consume it; this Cross that Christians must take up, if they arrive at that blessed Haven of rest which the Lord of Heaven and Earth has appointed for them that love him; thus Christians bowing under the Cross, the power
of God, and Crucifying their corrupt Wills, and Affections, and Lusts, with that exalted, proud, arrogant spirit, that carryes people above the Fear of God and the blessed example and hu∣miliation of Christ; Christians (so cal∣led) coming under this Cross, then will you be a good example to all Turks and Infidels in the World, and your good Conversations and true Love one unto another will convince the Turk that the Lord is with you of a Truth, there being no other way to true happiness and peace with the Li∣ving God, but by Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life, which people being converted to and living in, therein shewing forth the great Love of God to the World in his Son; this will preach forth the righteousness of God unto them who are strangers there∣unto; and the people thus gathered to the Lord, the Lord will be with them, and plead their Cause, whilst you observe that great and chief Com∣mandment, in loving God above all, and your Neighbours as your selves; in do∣ing
this you will please God, and reach to the witness in them that do not know God: But if you continue meer Talkers and high Professors of what you should do, and leave that undone which should be done, therein you will be a bad example, and an ill savour to other Na∣tions, and a stink, which the Lord of Heaven and Earth will never be pleased with; though you may cry Lord, Lord, in your deep Distress, he will not hear, if you regard Iniquity (the Prayers of the wicked are abomination to the Lord) I speak the Truth in the love of God unto you, in dealing plainly, accor∣ding to his blessed Will: You that say, you are Christians, examine your selves; will the name Christian avail you, if you be out of the Christian-Life and Nature? What will it avail you to retain a Name of being Christ's Followers, and if you be found in the way of the Scribes and Pharisees, by whom he was Crucified? What will it avail you to talk of the Truth in the inward parts, that which is lovely in the sight of the Lord, if you be found
in a Spirit of Deceit and Falshood in the Friendship of the World, resisting the Just, and he doth you no harm? What will it avail you to cry Lord, Lord, and not wait to know his Will and do it? What is it the near for you to talk of God's great Love to the World in the Son of his Love, who invited all to him, who was and is meek and lowly, where the Rest and Peace is in the joy of the Lord to Immortal Souls, if you be found in froward, peevish, exalted, imaginary, proud, ambitious spirits? What will it avail you to read and talk of the holy mens Lives and blessed Practices, if you be found in the Life and Practice of Cain, Nabal and Hamman? The Followers of Christ Jesus, the Heavenly man, they were and are to deny them∣selves, and take up a dayly Cross to Cain's Nature, to Nabal's Nature, to Haman's Nature: The blessed and effectual Cross that slayes the Enmity, and makes a reconciliation by the blessed Cross (the Power of the Lord and Saviour) Christians being plung'd, dipped, bap∣tized,
and brought under Christ, the power and wisdom of God: And in the blessed Gospel-order established, and therein shining forth to the Praise and Honour of God; this will preach and reach to the Turks and Infidels in the World, and overcome them, and make them confess, That Christ Jesus is a blessed Leader, and all that fol∣low him are blessed and happy forever; and that there is no other way to true Peace and Happiness, but by following Christ's blessed example and great humi∣liation, by all that ever come to attain to his Resurrection, he must lead them in the way. So, away with all your Wooden, Brazen, Iron, Golden Crosses, with all your Trumpery thereunto belonging, The very Turk sees over it. with all Images, and Religions which are turned into Trades and Merchandize, whereby spiritual wickedness and the Mystery of Ini∣quity is upholden; away with it all, it stinks. Now the great Mystery, Christ in us the Hope of Glory, is open∣ed,
a blessed Fountain to wash in, which makes clean the inside, and fits and prepares for his glorious and ever∣lasting Kingdom; the desire of all Na∣tions is come, and coming; blessed are all they that wait for him, and receive him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, Col. 3.11. Barbarian, Scythian, Bond nor Free, but Christ is all and all. And this Love of God to the World, in his Son Christ Jesus, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, by his universal Power and Wisdom hath raised thou∣sands of Living Witnesses, who can∣not deny him before men, knowing assuredly that the Cause is the Lord's, and he will plead it with all flesh; and to all faithful and true witnesses, that continue to the end, they shall have a Crown Immortal Life, the which Life and Im∣mortality is brought to Light through the Gospel (praises be to his holy Name forever) So its for True Christianity that many who are call'd Quakers have so deeply suffered to this day; and in this true Self-denyal and dayly Cross,
following our blessed Leader and Com∣mander Christ Jesus, we have sought the good of all mankind, testifying against Infidelity and Corruption where∣ever it appears. Take but a view of this Nation, and see what abundance of poor distressed Families are begging up and down, and many are ready to perish for want of Conveniencies; and do but view how others do swell in Pride and Luxury, and cover themselves over with a Name of Christian; whatever esteem this may have in the sight of fallen men, I am sure it hath none with God, nor those who are raised unto some degree of knowledge of his divine power and wisdom, by which all things were created good in the beginning, and by which alone that which is out of order must be put in∣to order again. The Lord God prosper his blessed work of Reformation, which he hath begun in the Earth, saith my Soul,
and the Souls of all who are truly sensible of his Righteousness therein. By one that did Live several years amongst them. Stephen Smith. The 8th. day of the 12th. Month, 1673 THE END.
A Faithful Testimony Concerning the SCRIPTURES, And Dangerous Estate that they are in, who through their private Interpretations do add unto, and diminish from, the Holy Prophesies therein Contained: And do thereby make void the End and Tendency of Gods great Love, through the Moving of his Holy Spirit in Holy Men, in giving forth those Blessed Testimonies plainly shewn. And the Blessed Motion, Operation, Revela∣tion and Divine Inspiration of Gods Ho∣ly Spirit in its Blessed Works and Manifesta∣tion in this day time (and season Asserted.) And an Exhortation unto all to Bow to the Light and Manifestation of Gods Holy Spirit in them; least the things which concern their Everlasting Rest and Peace be hid from them. With some brief Instances of Wicked mo∣tions, and their Effects; and Blessed motions, and their Effects, taken out of the Scriptures. Revel. 22.18. For I Testifie unto every man that heareth the words of the Prophesie of this Book: If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written (in this Book.) Printed in the Year, 1679.
A Faithful Testimony Concerning the SCRIPTURES COme all Professors of the holy Scriptures to the tryal, whe∣ther there may not be great and high talking of, by those who are real opposers of the very end and ten∣dency of that love and mercy of God which through the Scriptures is testi∣fied unto: Come to plain dealing, and weigh things in a true ballance; and let that which is light and vain, which is a lett that the Noble Seed cannot come forth: Let that be cast off, that the Nobility of your Understandings
may be opened and cleared from dark∣ness and error, that the things which concerns your everlasting peace may be witnessed, before you go from hence and shall be seen no more. The 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. Knowing this first, that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the Prophecy came not in old time by the Will of man: But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Now mind, since the Pro∣phesies in Scripture is of no private in∣terpretation; let all who would not be supposed to be of that number, who are giving their private Interpre∣tation of those weighty and high con∣cerns, consider what Spirit they are led and acted by therein. For as much as those weighty concerns cannot be understood, but by the universal love and mercy of God in and through the manifestation of the Light of his holy Spirit, given to every man to profit withall: Therefore all had need to consider, whether they feel and un∣derstand the mind and will of God
through the manifestation of his blessed Spirit, leading and guiding them into the knowledge of those Prophesies aforesaid: And if this love of God in the manifestation of his Spirit, be not taken heed unto, and received and used for that end it is given; all they who neglect it can give no other In∣terpretation of the Prophesies, but what they conceive in their private Conceptions, the which is a danger∣ous Estate; the Prophesies being deep things, wherein the great Salvation of the Lord unto mankind is signified; and this goodness and mercy of the Lord is only revealed by his Spirit, as said the Apostle, 1 Cor. 2.10. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for he searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. So its by taking heed unto the manifestation of the blessed gift of God (by which the love and mercy of God were witnessed unto by the holy men of God) that the Scriptures of Truth come to be clearly understood: And this Spirit of God giving to man kind light and under∣standing
in the things of God; this also pure and holy in man, the which must be taken heed unto by all that comes to a clear understanding in those weighty concerns of life and peace under that penalty, least they be hid from them: Therefore there is a necessity even for all to take heed to that love of God in the blessed ope∣ration and inshining of his holy Spi∣rit in them, as saith the holy Apostle, Rom. 1.19. Because that which may be kn of God, is manifest in them, for God hath  unto them. And therefore a that deny this universal love of God, the moving of his holy Spirit, and do nor the heed to the manifestation of it in themselves; they are they who are the opposers of the love and mercy of God signified through the Scriptures. And thus in the works of darkness, being found opposers of the  in∣tent and meaning of the will of God, through the blessed operation of his good Spirit; how are people giving private Interpretations of the Prophe∣sies
in the Scriptures according to their own private Imaginary conceivings, adding and diminishing to bring them to their corrupt minds and wills: In which works of darkness they make void the great love of God testified of by holy men throughout the Scrip∣tures, and so are without the real be∣nefit, which is and may be received through Faith and Comfort of the holy Scriptures, by them who do tru∣ly take heed to the manifestation of God's holy Spirit in them, which con∣vinceth the World of sin, and there∣fore universal; and take that for a rule and guide to walk by out of darkness, and to guide and lead into all Truth. Oh it's the carnal mind which is enmity against God; Rom. 8.7. for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. It's that mind that would make void this love of God in the manifestation of his Spirit to every man to profit with; as saith the Apostle, 1 Cor. 2.14. But the na∣tural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness un∣to
him; neither can he know them, be∣cause they are spiritually discerned. Therefore it is of necessity for all to take heed to the Revelation and Ma∣nifestation of Gods holy Spirit in them, if ever they come to a true know∣ledge of the love and mercy of God testified unto in old time: And there∣fore it's good for all to consider what state they are in, whether in a natu∣ral or spiritual, whether in a capacity to receive an understanding in the things of God testified of in the Scrip∣tures, or whether in a natural estate wresting them to their own destructi∣ons: In that state what false concep∣tions about the things of God are brought forth, the which genders to bondage and corruption. And in this Worldly wisdom, what diversity of Inventions do people get, make and find out, to keep them from the Cross which Christ exhorted his followers to take up dayly and fol∣low him? Though this may be ac∣counted as foolishness to them that perish; yet as said the Apostle, But
unto us that are saved, it's the power of God. It was not the intent in the moving of God's holy Spirit (in holy men, in giving forth those blessed Testimonies of God's righteousness and love therein unto the world) that people in their carnal minds and na∣tural estates, should cover their unrigh∣teousness therein, and deck and trim themselves therewith for some selfish advantage; the which are very pre∣sumptuous sins that have gotten do∣minion in the hearts of those who do account themselves Leaders of the peo∣ple: And indeed if the people did not love to have it so, they would bow to the manifestation of God's love and mercy in them: But being contrary minded, then to yeild to the good will and pleasure of God in the mov∣ing of his good Spirit; how greatly do they provoke the Lord of Heaven and Earth in grieving and vexing of his holy Spirit? as said the Prophet Isaiah in another Case, 63.10. But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their enemy,
and he fought against them: In that state it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living: I do therefore beseech all to be considerate in this weighty concern, wherein the Souls Immortal are so deeply concerned, and let not the day of God's Visitation in and by the striving of his good Spirit pass over your heads, least you be left mourning and grieving without God in the World, and so without any certain hope of all the Saints and Sanctified in the Truth: And through the blessed operation and revelation of the holy Spirit of Truth, he is now the hope of all them, who are real denyers of that which hath a tenden∣cy of grieving and quenching his ho∣ly Spirit; and in this is Christs Doctrine obeyed, in denying that which is contrary to the will of God, whose blessed will is the satisfaction of all; and for that end hath he given of his good Spirit unto all, the which ought to be taken unto by all. The gain-saying of the striving there∣of, was the cause of the Worlds over∣throw
of old; in that they grieved his good Spirit, and therein provoked the Lord of Glory, till in his hot displea∣sure, he said, his Spirit should not al∣wayes strive with them: And the cause of the Scribes and Pharisees Crucifying the Lord of Glory by their wicked hands, was by their doing despite un∣to Gods holy Spirit, they being stiff Necked, did resist the moving and striving of Gods holy Spirit, as their Fathers did before them, which brought those sad and miserable Calamities (which may be read of) upon them. And that which was the cause of Ig∣norance in Dayes, Ages and Gene∣rations past; is now the cause of great ignorance in which the people living in error know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God; and for want of the knowledge thereof, people do perish. Thus plain and evident it is to all who have the Eyes of their under∣standings opened, that they who are true owners of the Scriptures, their sense and knowledge thereof comes by the moving of the Spirit of Christ,
who lighteth every man that comes into the world, unto which the true Gospel Ministers turned people, even from darkness that was in them, unto the Light that was in them; which Light that shineth in Darkness, and the Darkness comprehendeth it not. In this principle of the Light of Gods ho∣ly Spirit, which makes manifest the Deeds of Darkness, must all believe, and obey, that come to find Life and Peace: And read John 1.1. what is there said concerning the word of God, by which all things were made, the which the Devil is out of; though he may get the words, and talk and preach of the word: But being out of the word of God, he cannot preach that: He that can receive it, let him; for in him the word by which all things were made, is Life; and the Life is the Light of men: And for the in∣shining and breathing forth of this Light out of Darkness, must all wait in the Self-denyal of all dark works, taking up the Cross dayly thereunto; that Life and Immortality may be
brought to Light through the Gospel: And if this be hid: It is hid to them that are lost, In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that be∣lieve not, 2 Cor. 3.3, 4. least the light of his glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine upon them. And whilst this love of God testified unto through the Scriptures, remains hid; what true benefit can such be supposed to have of the Scriptures, though they may be never such high Talkers and Professors thereof: Oh that people would consider what they are doing, that they may not labour and travail all their days in vain, and lye down in sorrow at last. Come, be sober, be wise you Pro∣fessors of the Scriptures, and remem∣ber that it is witten: For we must all appear before the Judg∣ment seat of Christ; 2 Cor. 5.10. that every one may receive the things done in the body, whether they be good or bad: What then will a bare Profes∣sion of holy mens words and works
wrought without you, avail you? if you be found in uncleanness, in un∣savoury words and works? What will it avail you to have read what blessed and holy Lives the Saints and Servants of the most High God led and possessed, if you be found in an un∣savoury Life, and in an unholy Con∣versation, in an unclean Possession? If so, will you not be found denyers of the scope and tendency of Scrip∣tures; where it is written, to be spi∣ritually minded, is Life and Peace; and all that possess this are in a clean and holy possession: The Scriptures saith, to be spiritually minded is Life and Peace: So to the blessed motions of Gods holy Spirit you must turn your minds, and eye its leadings and gui∣dings; this is the way the Saints and Servants of the most high God were directed to, and guided in, by the true Preachers of the everlasting Gospel: And therefore unto that of God which he manifests and shews, you must bring your hearts and minds, before you can know the law of the Spirit of Life,
to set you free from the law of sin and death: Oh consider, will a talk of free∣dom avail one in Captivity, whilst he sees no way but that he must remain so all his Life time? Awake, awake out of your Dream unto righteouness, and sin not, that you may now he Lord and his way; the which is above mans ways, as the Heaven is above the Earth: The Lord of Heaven and Earth hath ordained a means and way to everlasting Peace and Happinss, and the Scriptures testifie the same: Even of Christs spiritual appearance, who is the Way, Truth and Life; so to that of God which is holy, must every one come that is made holy; unto that which is righteous, must every one come that is truly made righteous and meet for the Kingdom of God, the which the unrigh∣teous cannot inherit: Oh hat people would consider their wayes wherein they walk, and not go on in evil wayes, and satisfie themselves with a alk what they have heard of the righteous way, and live out of it; for the great love of God in his Heavenly gift to the
World, was and is, that people should be led by it to that repentance never to be repented of, even to forsake that which is manifest to be wrong, false and evil, by the faithful and true wit∣ness the Spirit of Truth in every one: As it is written, Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, Isaiah 55.4. a Leader and Commander to the people: And it is also written, 1 Joh. 5.10. He that be∣lieveth on the Son of God, hath the wit∣ness in himself: Blessed are they who are in the way of the knowledge of recon∣ciliation unto this faithful and true witness, and live up unto it; This will be to their joy and comfort in that life and peace which is everlasting: And to them that do not believe, he is a witness of their unbelief and hard heartedness, to their shame and confusion; as you may read, And I will come near to you to Judgment, Malachi 3.5. and I will be a swift witness against Sorcerers, and against the Adulterers, and against false Swearers, and against those that oppress
the Hireling in his Wages the Widow and the Fatherless, and that turn away the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts; read Rom 8.16. Joh. 1.5. By this you may see how plentifully the Scriptures testifie of the Spirit of Truth witness: And now try in your selves, come to the exa∣mination, if any be unclean in Thought or Action; is there not that within that shews it, and witnesseth against it? If any be unmerciful this witness will witness against it, if any back-bite, or defraud, or murmur, or lye, or steal, or bear false witness, or contemn the counsel of the Lord, and proud and high minded in contemning his holy Law and Commandment; this faith∣ful and true witness will ever be a witness against all such, and against all that is bad, and hath a tendency of defiling and corrupting any: And therefore all they that deny this, are real denyers of the love and mercy of God testified unto through the Scrip∣tures: And further, concerning this faithful and true wirness Christ the
word of God; observe what the Scrip∣ture saith, Bom. 10.6, 7. Say not in thy heart, who shall ascend into Feaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above;) or who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is the word of faith which we preach: (Now mind) are not you opposers of the love and mercy of God, in the moving of his holy Spirit in those holy men which gave forth the Scripture; whilst you remain gain-sayers of that more sure word, so nigh the heart and mouth; and in your exaltedness of Spirit in a fleshly worldly wisdom, being puft up above what is written; what a vain travail and labour they live in? In imagining and creating to your selves, a contrary way to what the Lord hath ordained to salvation: Come to the witness in you, and by that (if you conrinue your subjection thereunto) you will be sensible that it is the love of God unto you; and in this love be admo∣nisht
to give private Interpretations of the Prophesies in the Scripture, least thereby you provoke the Lord, till swift destruction comes upon you. And for your further Information, observe what the Sripture saith, 1 Joh. That was the true light which lighteth every man that comes into the World; as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God: The Scripture doth not say, as many as profess him, he gives power; but it saith, as many as receive him who light∣eth every man that comes into the World, to them he gives power, &c. Indeed he is to be received in his spiritual appearance; and for that end he stnds at the door and knocks in gentle reproofs and convincement, whereby the hard heart must be broken, and set open unto him, and receive him, be∣fore the remission from evil be wit∣nessed, and the great horrible clouds of darkness be expelled, and the vail over the heart rent, and power re∣ceived to overcome the wicked one; as it is written, Behold I stand at the
door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, Revel. 3.20. and open the door, I will come into him, and will Sup with him, and he with me. This is a great tender of love and mercy; be they not very hard hearted, that saith unto him, de∣part from us, we desire not the know∣ledge of thy ways; these are they that oppose the Scriptures Testimony, and shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; Mat. 23.13. for ye neither go in your selves, neither suffer ye them that are entring to go in. This was the sad and deplorable con∣dition of those high professors of the Law and the Prophets, whom Christ pronounced dreadful wo against: And all that are refisting the Spirits Testi∣mony in themselves, as they did, are in the same state of Hypocrisie, and un∣der the same sentence of dreadful wo and misery: Therefore I beseech you to consider what state or condition you are in, and don't go about to exalt your selves in wisdom above what is written, but take notice what Christ
said, Luke 17. For behold the Kingdom of God is within you: These are plain and true words, a wiser then he that spoke them never was, nor ever shall be: Indeed it's very great presumption for any to exalt a wisdom above his; and to set at naught his blessed counsel in so great and weighty a concern: And for further proof of the necessity of bowing to that of God in you; ob∣serve also further what Christ said, But whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him, Joh. 4.14. shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life: See how plain and evident are the Testimonies in Scrip∣ture, unto that which is pure and holy of God within: It must needs also be as plain and evident, that those who do oppose the way to the knowledge thereof, are real opposers of that love and mercy of God testified unto by the moving of Gods holy spirit, as re∣corded in the Scriptures: Indeed that is a very sad state, and miserable will
be the end of  who live and dye in it: Therefore be admonished to take heed to the Light of Christ with∣in thee, ch is a blessed leader, pro∣ved  thousand, who are li∣ving  of its blessed leading, them that are led nd guided by it, out of that which would harm them; an a blessed Commander he is, who gives power to them that receive him tk up his Commandments, the which are no way grievous; and in the do∣ing thereof, there is great peace, as said David, Psal. 119.165. Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them: The Law is pure, holy and good, and to be taken heed unto in the heart: Jr. 31.33. Come, come to the pure prin∣ciple of God within, or else you can never know the Truth and its freedom, not the will of God signi∣fied through the Truth, under what denomination soever; the end and tondency of Gods love thereby, being that all should come to the knowledge of the Truth and be saved; to which
end none can come, but as they take heed to the blessed motions of Gods holy Spirit in them: Cease therefore your vain labour and hard travail un∣der that slavish servitude, where the prince of the power of the Air ruleth them who doth despite unto the Spirit of Truth; and he blinds and darkens the minds of people, so that unto them he makes darkness seem as light, and light seem as darkness; and so he in∣structs his Vassells and Slaves, to call light darkness, Isa. 5.20. and darkness light; evil he calls good, and good evil; and thus in and through his dark works he brings people, and keeps them under wo and misery. Oh that people would fear the Lord, and depart from evil, and wait upon the Lord in the leadings and guidings of his good Spirit in them, the which will draw them un∣to the knowledge of Christ in them, the hope of Glory; even unto Christ, the way, truth and life; the same yesterday, to day, and for ever; the resurrection and the life, the first born of every creature:
who said, Search (or ye search) the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, John 5. and they are they that testifie of me: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life of me: It is very plain and evident by what hath been said, and may be said; That except people come unto Christ, the power and wisdom of God to all that believe, they cannot see life, but the wrath of God abide on them; and being dead in trespasses and sins, under con∣demnation, and the wages of sin which is death: In this state, what ever high talk and profession may be made from what may be read in the Scrip∣tures of Truth, of the Heavenly gift, which is Life Eternal; this will but add to their condemnation, who do put Christ at a distance far from them, and will not receive him in his spiri∣tual appearance; but do despite to his Spirit of Grace, in quenching and grieving the motions thereof: Such prophane unprofitable talkers, are real opposers of the Spirits Testimony, the which testifies of Christ: Ʋnto whom
all must come, that do receive Eternal Life; even unto his quickning Spirit, the Lord from Heaven; And wait to feel his power to raise out of the ways of death and destruction, and to trans∣late them by the blessed work of re∣generation and conversion, into the way of life and peace: This is the work of the Spirit, and not of the Letter: For the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life. (Mind,) It is not the Letter and Testimony of the Law written, which effects this blessed work, in giving life ut that holy and blessed Spirit of e in Christ Jesus which sets free from sin and death: The which Law of the Spirit, is testi∣fied of, and born witness unto, by the Letter and Testimony of the Law and Prophets, and the Apostles and Dis∣ciples of Christ Jesus: Therefore I do in the moving of the Spirit of Truth, according to my measure therein, ex∣hort and perswade all to take heed un∣to the manifestation of Gods holy Spi∣rit in them, for the opening the eye of your understanding in those weigh∣ty
cons of everlasting life, as testi∣fied of through the Scriptures of Truth: And that the Scriptures may Be set in their right places, and the honour which is due unto the Lord of Heavn  earth, may be given unto him, who hath powerover all flesh. and gives Eternal Life to all that are freely given up to him; and with whom he is well pleased, and doth ac∣cept: As it is written, My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; John 10.27, 28. and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Oh, be admonished to leave o giving private Interpretations of the Prophesies, the Seriptures; and bow to the universal love and mercy of God in the moving of his Spirit of Truto, that thereby you may be led and guided into all Truth. And for your sakes, who desire that Truth and Righteousness may  place in the Earth again; for your clearer Information take notice
it is written; He that committeth sin is of the Devil, for the Devil sinneth from the beginning; Joh. 3.8. for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil. (Now ob∣serve) what a sad condition they are in, who through unbelief and hard heartedness, in resisting the spiritual appearance of the quickening Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, in which works of darkness, do draw such a vail of gross darkness over them, that they cannot so much as see to the begin∣ning of that blessed work and redemp∣tion from under the enemies power of darkness in sin and corruption: The which blessed works of redemption, was, is, and is to be wrought by the manifestation of Gods great love to World in his Son; but people being darkened, and their minds and un∣derstandings blinded, through the God of this World; they do in this dark and sad condition, plead and contend for sin, the which is the De∣vils work, the which through dark∣ness,
they conclude must continue for term of Life: Now mind, he that committeth sin is of the Devil; and therefore this Doctrine of pleading for sin, must also be of the Devil, sin being the Devils work; those works of plead∣ing for sin must also be the Devils. And thus through gross darkness and great and horrid Ignorance, are the works of the Devil, the grand ad∣versary and enemy of Souls, exalted above the blessed works of Christ Je∣sus, who was and is manifest to de∣stroy the Devils works; Even the Son of Gods love Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and for ever: And these works of God, in and through the manifesta∣tion of the Son his love unto all man∣kind, are in every degree righteous, perfect, holy and pure forever; and herein is his power, dominion and glory seen, felt and clearly understood by them who are his workmanship, created again unto good works, the which he hath ordained and appointed for mankind to live and walk in. And by and through them is his power,
dominion and glory confessed unto, and set above all, and over all the ene∣mies works, and power of darkness, as it was in the Primitive time, by them in whom the Spirit of the Lord had place to live and move in; and in the blessed motions thereof were those blessed Testimonies in Scripture given forth, wherein is shewed his great love to the World, in the manifestation of his power and wisdom in flesh, to de∣stroy the Devils works: And by the same blessed Gospel, through which the righteousness of God was then revealed; by the preaching of the same Gospel, is now the righteous∣ness of God revealed, and confessed too by them who are raised by the same power to be the living witnesses thereof: And to that same power and wisdom, by which the Devils works are destroyed, and destroying in these last dayes, is Confession made by them who are raised in some measure unto the knowledge thereof; and by the same power and wisdom is Testimony given against the Spirit of Antichrist, the
which came in, in the Apostles dayes; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; 2 Tim. 3.5. as said the Apostle, from such such turn away. Now take notice, that it was by this Spirit of Antichrist, That the false Teachers were set up and maintained, by whom the damnable Heresies came in, 2 Pet. 2. in denying the Lord that bought them, by whose pernicious wayes, the way of Truth hath been, and is evil spoken of: In all the Congrega∣tions and Assembles of unbelievers, where the beast with his many Heads and Horns, doth exercise his power and Antichrists Spirit, is head Leader and Commander: There this dam∣nable Heresie is maintained, that no more of the Revelation of Gods holy Spitit, is to be known now adayes, say they Revelations are ceased; and they look upon it to be presumption, and of a dangerous consequence for any to speak or testifie of what the Spirit of the Lord reveals and makes known now adayes, or for any to
expect new Revelations now adayes: Oh damnable Heresie, what people that have but the least glimmering of the things of God, would give away their reason and understanding there∣in, and maintain such false Preachers, by whom these damnable Heresies is maintained; this is the work of a subtil enemy, unto whom people being joyn∣ed, do betray the light and under∣standing, the which in some degree or measure at some time or season, through the striving of Gods holy Spirit, they have or may be inlightned withall in the things that concern their everlast∣ing peace and well-being in that world which is without end: For as much as the good Spirit reaches to all that they may profit in their perverting their understanding therein, and not profit∣ing thereby, will be no good answer in the day of account, when the faith∣ful and true witness will rise up against them, testifying unto what they have had; and how they have betrayed it: if a Talent or Talents are hid in the Earth, the Earth then shall not be
able to conceal it; but the hidden things must be brought to light, and every one will be rewarded according to the Deeds done in the body, whe∣ther they be good or evil. It will be a shame to say then, my sins and iniqui∣ties were not manifest unto me by the Spirit of Truth; and so think to hide them and cover them with lying ex∣cuses; saying, it was a natural Light, or as some have called it, a Devil: Thus mankind being darkened by the enemy, the man of sin; He now exalts himself above all that is called Gods, 2 Thes. 2.3, 4. and sits and judges the motions of Gods holy Spirit to be delusions, or in∣sufficient to lead and guide out of evil; accounting that Religion good enough, that can talk of what is recorded in Scripture; how the Primitive Chri∣stians were moved and acted by Gods holy Spirit: But saith this man of sin, to expect new Revelations now a∣dayes, this is dangerous; Revelations are ceased, the operation of Gods Spi∣rit is not to be known now adayes;
and thus the man of sin brings a fear upon all his vassals and subjects, that they dare not own the Spirit of Truth, as manisested in them, to lead and guide them into all Truth; though Christ Jesus did bear witness to it, and did commend it unto the world; Even that Spirit of Truth which reproves the World of sin, &c. But the man of sin teaches his Subjects to deny the suffi∣ciency thereof, and fears them, and keeps them in such subjection; that they must not so much as confess to the sufficiency thereof: Now believe in it, saith the man of sin, the Scrip∣ture is the only rule of life; and in this belief he keeps them who are on∣ly professors thereof, under his strong delusions in many Sects and Opinions, wrangling and scolding about their coverings; one Sect of Professors, of what holy Lives and blessed Conver∣sations the Saints and Servants of the Lord of Heaven and Earth lived by the guidance of his holy Spirit in the Primitive time: This Sect cryes, my dress, my covering is the fairest and best;
another Sect cryes down that dress and covering, and sets up another dress and covering; and what abundance of these Sects there be, let the wise Judge, who live under the wo and misery; as is written: Wo to the rebellious Children, Isa. 30.1. saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover, with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin: And as Peter said of the salse Teachers; Having eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot cease from sin, 2 Pet. 2.14. beguiling unstable Souls; an heart they have exercised with covet∣ous Practices, cursed Children: And as Jude in his Epistle said of them who was then departed from the Faith and blessed works of the holy Spirit; so it may be as truly said of these: These be they who seperate themselves, sensual, hav∣ing not the Spirit: But these speak evil of those things which they know not, but what they know naturally as bruit beasts: And being thus corrup∣ted and exalted, live above the pure fear of the Lord; they in this exalted∣ness
pervert and wrest the Scriptures, to bend them to their corrupt wills and imaginations: They do in the dark works of the man of sin, give their private Interpretations of the Pro∣phesies in Scripture, and in a mystery of iniquity, they speak evil of the mo∣tions of Gods holy spirit; in which blessed motions, those blessed Pro∣phesies were given forth; and cannot be understood, but by the blessed operation and moving of the same blessed spirit; but the moving of this blessed spirit, being mocked at by Hagar's brood, that Birth after the flesh, which gendereth to bondage; this brood in their several Sects, do ex∣alt the mystery of iniquity, and spiri∣tual wickedness in high places; and under this mystery conclusions are made, that Christ who suffered by wicked hands, hath done all for them; and that their sins are forgiven, in what he did and suffered without them; and their Confessions and Professions to this purpose, they look upon to be sound and good Religion, though
sin and iniquity they live in, and plead for it for term of Life: But let all the wise in heart, who have not so far be∣trayed their reason and understand∣ing in the things of God, but that some little glimmering and descerning they have thereof: Consider and judge, whether the man of sin be not the Author of that Religion; and whe∣ther such dark works have not a ten∣dancy of overthrowing the true pur∣pose and intent of all the holy mens Testimonies, given forth by the mov∣ing of Gods holy spirit, as recorded in the Scriptures: Much might be written concerning these workers in the works of darkness; but I give but some brief hints thereof, and leave the wise in heart to Judge. And I do ask this question; whe∣ther in case the Motions, Operations, Revelations and Inspirations of Gods holy spirit of Truth, have not the leading and guiding of peoples hearts and minds in their conversations and all their ways and works, where this is denyed? Whether then doth not a
spirit of error and falshood, deceit and hypocrisie lead instead thereof? Indeed misery, and miserable will be the end of all those who do persist and go on under the cover of the An∣tichristian spirit, to oppose the great love of God in the manifestation of the Son of his love, who both was, and is manifest to destroy the Devils works: And in this glorious manifestation of Gods spirit of grace, light, power and wisdom, is the Lord of Heaven and Earth at work this time and season, to create again and redeem mankind out of the fall, death and curse; and is pouring out of his blessed spirit upon all flesh, as was Prophesied of through the moving of Gods holy spirit in old time by the Prophet Joel 2.28. And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your Sons and your Daughters shall Pro∣phesie, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see Visions; and also upon the Servants, and upon the Handmaids in those dayes, will I pour out my Spirit. Now Hagars brood
do object; and say, that this was ful∣filled in the primitive Christians days, but now it is ceased, &c. Answer, That the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the primitive Christians, who believed and waited in the manifestation thereof, that is evident to all who read what blessed Lives they lived, and boly examples they were, in their day and genera∣tion: And they were built upon the foundation of the holy Prophets and Apostles; and this was the spirit of Christ, as you may read 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. The Spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie, when it testified before-hand the suffering of Christ, and the glory that should follow: It was by the moving of the spirit of Christ in the Prophets, who prophesied of the grace that should come: This spirit of Christ in them, was their foundation on which they built, and from whence they had those blessed Revelations and Visions of that great salvation, the which through the pouring out of the same blessed spirit of Christ upon all flesh
should come: And those who deny∣ed themselves, and took up the Cross and followed Christs blessed example, even in his great humiliation and pa∣tience, they were witnesses of the ful∣filling of those blessed Prophesies: And the Apostle in his Epistle to the Ro∣mans, saith plainly: Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his: Rom. 8. (Let all take notice) that it is alone by the spirit of Christ that any can be truly said to be followers of Christ, and so true Christians, as being baptized by this one spirit into one body (out of the many Sects.) And all them who were possessers and injoyers of Christs Spirit: In them was fulfilled the Pro∣phesy so far, as they were partakers of the spirit thereof. But unto what a degree of gross darkness are people plunged into, through a great night of Apostasie; where conclusions are made, that the Operation, Revelation and Inspirati∣on of this Spirit of Christ is ceased now adays. They may as well say, Christ
hath now adays no followers, there∣fore none are true Christians; the many Sects and Opinions have gotten varieties of Baptisms, but all out of the Spirit of Christ: That is ceast (they say) now adays, the operation and work thereof was fulfill'd in the pri∣mitive dayes. Now every one to his private Interpretations, and build some Babel; the Nations are now be∣come as waters, and the Whore with her Golden Cup of Sorceries rids over all; and the Nations have drunk of her Cup of Fornications, and are made so drunk therewith, that they see no need of the Revelation of Christ's Spi∣rit now adays: Their Mother Mystery, Babylon the Mother of Harlots; she instructs her brood of Children to kindle fires of Confession and Profes∣sion, without true Faith and Obe∣dience of what blessed Testimonies are left upon record, and to warm them∣selves by the sparks of their fire; and to cover themselves with the Harlots Attire, even their own self-righteous∣ness, in seigned Faiths, and feigned
Humilities, in feigned Worships, and feigned Beliefs; having denyed the sufficiency of the Arm and Power of God now adays, and the Sanctificati∣on, Wisdom, Righteousness and Re∣demption of Christ Jesus now adays; contenting themselves with Profes∣sion and Confession of Christ Jesus, that he was made Righteousness, Wis∣dom and Sanctification, and Redemp∣tion, to them that believed in the Primitive time, by the pouring out of his blessed Spirit; then the Arm of the Lord was revealed, and the power of the Lord did redeem people from under the enemies power, and the Faith of Gods Elect was then very precious: And the power of Christ Je∣sus, who hath power over all flesh, that then was the higher power, and people did then bow under it, and con∣fessed him before men; then indeed Christs Doctrine and Commands taught and received, and his precious blood confessed unto by them that were witnesses thereunto, who through the vertue and sufficiency were redeemed
from under the man of sin's power, and so cleansed from the filthy Gar∣ments of sin: Then indeed the Lord had a people the which were his pur∣chased possession, being sanctified throughout in Soul, Body and Spirit, by the pouring out and renewings of Christs holy Spirit: They were not their own, being purchased and bought with a price; they all confessed unto the Lord that had bought them, and all the true Preachers of righteous∣ness, they preacht up then the suffi∣ciency of the Blood of the Lamb, and the uncorruptable word of life, and laboured and travelled for the form∣ing of Christ in the Believers, that they might present them perfect in Christ Jesus: All this saith the Seed of the bond-woman, where Mistery Babylon hath her brood; we cannot deny but that the state and condition of the Primitive Christians were as aforesaid: But they may say, if they will speak the Truth, our Mother Mistery Baby∣lon hath taught us another Lesson now adays: Alas, for you our fore-Fathers,
Demas and the Antichristian Spirit, that led abundance from among the true Christians; many in the Antichri∣stian Spirit went out and imbraced this World, and in the Wisdom thereof, the God of the World blinded our our Fore-fathers Minds, and then the Gospel was hid, and in the Apostacy we grew, being inwardly ravened from the Spirit of Christ, we lost the sense of the sufficiency of the power thereof: Then the Spirit of Antichrist that led and became head, and the Beast, and false Prophet, with many Heads and Horns, some like a Lamb, having received power from the Dra∣gon, became in time such a great head and mountain, that they made War with the true Woman and her Seed, and cast out floods of ungodliness a∣gainst that Birth and Seed that was conceived by the free Woman; and in such a degree the Beast prevailed, that he proclaimed open War; say∣ing, who is able to make War with the Beast: Thus the Seed of the bond Woman, who are conceived and
brought forth out of the Womb of Mistery Babylon, may truly say; the Arm of flesh is now accounted for the higher power, and we teach for Doctrine the Commands of Men; our Mother hath trained us up, and taught us to deny the power of the Lord to be the higher power, and to deny the infallible teachings of the Grace of Gods Spirit; and to deny the Ope∣ration and Revelation, and Inspiration of Gods holy Spirit now a dayes, and to say that is ceased now adayes: And now we can live bravely in the Lusts of our own eyes, and in the Lust of our own flesh, and in the Pride of Life, under many Fair Coverings that our Mother hath made us; having cast off Christs Yoak, we are now at liberty in the flesh to use our Tongues in our own wills and pleasures; the Beast and false Prophet hath purchased this liberty for us, and our Mother sits as Queen, and saith, we shall see no sorrow: It is service good enough now adayes to be high talkers of the holy mens words and works, and to
set them up for Teachers who have an Art and subtilty to please men best with their good Words and fair Speeches. As for the universal Spirit and power of the Lord Jesus and his blessed Office to fit and prepare for the blessed Ministery: Our Mother Mistery Babylon hath taught us to de∣ny the sufficiency thereof; and to set up Universities and Schools to make Ministers by, and let them be as grace∣less as they will, so they be Witty and Learned, and can talk Learnedly of the good words and Testimonies that pro∣ceeded from the moving of Gods Spirit through Fisher-men, Shepheards and Herds-men, and the like: If they can by their floods of Eloquence and high flown Doctrines and Speeches, under fair shews of Confession and Profession of some things that have been done, and of some things that should be done, and yet leave all undone; and stop the very motions of the Spirit of Truth, by and in which alone every thing that is good is done, and without it we can do nothing that's good and ac∣ceptable
and well pleasing to God. We the Children of Mistery Babylon, may say, if our Preachers and Teachers do so well apply themselves to Learn∣ing, and get such curious Arts and Eloquence, as to stop the motions of the Spirit of Truth, now adays they do our Mothers work well, and de∣serves good Incouragement (some long Coats, some short Coats) some Shop∣keepers, and Trades; (a vast Revenew by the year) some more, some less, ac∣cording as we and our Merchants can agree: And for this Trade and Mer∣chandize, we are beholding to the Beast and false Prophet, who hath pur∣chased this liberty for us, to deny the Revelation, Operation and Divine In∣spiration of the Spirit of Truth now adayes: And so to give our private Interpretations of the holy Prophesies in Scripture, and to make void the very end and tendency of the moving of Gods holy Spirit through holy men, in giving forth the same. Thus you may see the Fruit of your Doctrine, you Seed of the bond Wo∣man;
who are nourished and trained up by your Mother Mistery Babylon, in whose Womb all the Treachery in Cruel Butchery hath been conceived and brought forth; who have been so drunk with the Whores Cup of Sorce∣ries, that you have not spared to drink the Blood of the holy Prophets, A po∣stles and Saints, and Martyrs of the living God; and this is, and hath been the fruits and effects of the motions of your own proud, arrogant, exalted spirits, where∣by you have disdained and mocked the very appearance of Gods holy Spi∣rit of Truth, and the Light thereof: You have contemned and spoke slight∣ly and evil of, and all this have you done under a Mistery; wherein, in your drunken fits, you have killed and spoiled the Servants of the living God, and then wip't your Mouths like Sheep-biting Dogs; and made the World believe that Worshipped the Beast, that you had done some service for the Lord: You are the Generati∣on whom Christ spoke of, Mat. 23.33. Ye Serpents, ye generation of Vipers,
how can ye escape the damnation of Hell? Fill up your measure, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth. For of a Truth, the good Husband∣man, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, hath all this while reserved a Seed, as it is written; And as Esaias said before, Rom. 9.29. except the Lord of Sabbath had left us a Seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha: And in this is the Lord replenishing the Earth and making of it fruitful in vertue, in life, in praises to his holy name, even by the same spirit of Truth that moved in the holy men of God, that gave forth those holy Prophesies and blessed Testimonies in the Scrip∣tures of Truth: And this is the time and season wherein the Lord is pouring out his spirit, even the same spirit as he did pour out upon his Sons and Daugh∣ters in the Primitive time: And its by the Operation, Revelation and Divine Inspiration of the same spirit of Christ Jesus, in and by which the Holy Pro∣phesies
and Testimonies in the Scrip∣ture comes to be understood: And in this spirit the Lord hath, and is ordain∣ing Ministers that they may go, and bring forth fruit, and that their fruit may remain: And by the power and efficasie thereof, are thousands of living witnesses raised now in these dayes, unto whom the goodness, mercy and loving kindness of the Lord is reveal∣ed, even by the Operation, Divine Inspiration and blessed effects of the same spirit of Christ Jesus, which the holy men of God were witnesses of in the Primitive dayes: And in and by this spirit of power and wisdom, is the Lord made Righteousness, Wisdom, Sanctification and Redemption unto his people who are believers this day, as he was in the Primitive days unto his people who did believe in him: And by the power and effectual works of this spirit of Christ Jesus in these days, time and season; The Blind receive their Sight, Mat. 11.5, 6. and the Lame Walk, the Lepers are Cleansed, and the Deaf
Hear, the Dead are raised up, and the Poor have the Gospel Preached to them: And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me: This spirit of Christ Jesus was the Foundation of the Pro∣phets and Apostles, on which the true Believers (which were the Church of Christ) was built; and its on this Foundation that the true Believers (which is the Body of Christ) which is his Church is built this day, time and season, where Christ is Head, Leader, Law-giver and Commander; and by his spirit is the blessed Worship set up now in the Church of Christ, the which Christ set up in opposition to all false Worships in the Primitive time; as you may read: But the hour cometh, when the true Worshipers shall Worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth; John 4.23, 24. for the Father seeketh such to Worship him: God is a Spirit, and they that Worship him, must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth. Therefore yours is the false Worship now, where the Revelation, Operation and Divine Inspiration of
this blessed spirit of Truth is denyed now adays: Your Worship is false, imaginary and conceited; for none can truly call Jesus Lord, but by the leading and guiding of the same holy spirit of Truth; and all that makes mention of his holy Name, let them depart from Iniquity: And all you who do not; but do continue in the Mistery thereof, in subjection to the man of sin; your Prayers are the Prayers of the wicked, the which is abomination to the Lord: And your patcht up Sermons, the which you Study and Frame up in your Brain from the works of others: They are all alike abomination; and how costly these works of abomination are, let the Wise in Heart judge: And in all where this blessed spirit of Truth is rejected and stoped in its motions, and so griev∣ed and quenched, and another spirit leads; all their labour and travel is vain, and your Consultations are vain, and whatsoever you form up, be it an Instrument never so cunningly and wisely wrought in the deepest of
your Skill and Councel, in the highest degree of the Worlds Wisdom to op∣pose the out-goings of this blessed Spi∣rit of Christ Jesus; it shall never pro∣sper, neither shall the Contrivers ever prosper in their works: Look back 20 or 30 years past, where great under∣takings have been (even if it had been possible) to have ruined and spoiled all those who gave Testimony to this Spirit of Truth: And see what sad ef∣fects those works of Opposition have produced; what hath your turning of things upside down availed you? Alas for you, your worth is the product of ruine and misery; that which you in∣tend to your peaceable Neighbours (will come upon your selves,) your own works in your singular exalted spirits is the purchaser thereof. Oh you Ignorant Fools, who are blinded by the God of this Wold, and are so high flown, that you go about to limit the holy God in the goings out of his holy Spirit; you may as well under∣take to alter the course of the Sun, and stop up the course of the Ebbing and
Flowing of the Sea: Your sins of Pre∣sumption would be much alike, and your Folly will end in as great shame; Indeed your presumption arises from an Arm of Flesh, and long continu∣ance in vain Customs, Traditions and Inventions: And because you can clap up in Prisons, and make Havock, and Ruine, and Spoile of People and their Goods; your spirit that leads you in these works, being an envious, Malicious, Cruel, Abominable, Wick∣ed spirit; therefore proceeds this wrong Judgment from you, even that Gods holy Spirit in Revelation, Ope∣ration and Divine Inspiration, as mo∣ving through holy Men in the Primi∣tive time, is now ceased: But if it were so, as you vainly Imagine; then shew where the difference lyes be∣tween you who call your selves Chri∣stians, and the Heathens, if the Spirit of Christ Jesus, the Spirit which peo∣ple were brought under in the Pri∣mitive time, and thereby to be Bap∣tized into one Body, the which was to be ruled and governed by that Spirit
of Christ. Now if the Revelation, Operation and Divine Inspiration thereof be ceased, then tell me by what spirit Christians, so called, are Baptized into so many Bodyes and Fellowships, and what Spirit rules and governs? And what difference there is between them called Heathen in their Fellowships, and them called Chri∣stians in their Fellowships, where the Authority, Rule and Government of Christs Spirit is denyed. Come to plain dealing, and don't Shuffl; you have been long enough in that work already; and the more you persist therein, the more you will be confounded, and the deeper plung∣ed into the horrible pit, and your Feet will be faster stuck in the Mire: There∣fore be admonished to deal plainly, least you be your own Executioners through your high presumptuous mindedness in bringing swift destructi∣on upon you; for of a Truth thousands have been bowed before the Lord un∣der a sense of their own insufficiency to perform that which is good and ac∣ceptable
of themselves, and have tru∣ly waited upon the Lord in a deep silence of the flesh: And indeed Christ hath appeared the second time in his blessed Spirit and power, and hath quickened and revived many hungry Souls, and he hath made known his sufficiency and help in the needful time. And all them who have in Truth laid hold of him, cannot part with him; for it's by him that we can do all things well pleasing and acceptable in the sight of God and man: And all that have begun in this Spirit, and are faithful and obedient thereunto, have Hope, Faith and Confidence to grow up and be made perfect thereby; and so attain to the mark and prize that is before us: Though many may and do turn aside through unfaithfulness and disobedience, and the many and great tryals that may be met withall, through the Oppression and Cruelty of the Worlds Spirit; yet over all that hath been, and may be met withall; we have Hope and Faith, that in and through the assistance of the Spirit and
Power of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, we shall persevere and go on, bearing the blessed fruits of his spirit, which is in all Goodness, Righteous∣ness and Truth, Patience, Meekness and Innocency, to the finishing our Testimony, and laying down our heads in Patience and Joy in Life Ever∣lasting. And further, concerning the out∣goings of this blessed spirit, I do testi∣fie my Faith therein; that the Lord of Heaven and Earth will by the Majesty and power thereof, overturn, over∣turn, overturn the power of darkness, and destroy all the cursed fruits that have sprung from the corrupt root and ground thereof: And by the light of the spirit of Christ Jesus, a sight is given to many faithful witnesses, that the Ax of the Lord is laid to the root thereof: And the Lord of Heaven and Earth that hath begun the work, will carry it on, and perfect it, to his own praise, honour and glory; and to the establishment of his purchased posses∣sion, where he Tabernacles and De∣lights to dwell forever.
And now this root and off∣spring of David, this bright and mov∣ing Star, hath taken deep rooting in many hearts and minds, from whence fruits spring and grow, to the praise and honour of the Lord of the Har∣vest; and to the joy and comfort of all the faithful and true labourers therein, whose out-goings being in the movings, leadings and guidings of his holy spirit; the which having taken deep root downwards, now yields fruits upward, in some an hun∣dred, in some sixty, and in some thirty, fold: As you may read of the Parable of the Sower and the seed that fell into the good ground: Mat. 15. And from the Lord of the Vineyard, whose is the Vineyard; he having planted many Heavenly Branches into the Vine, his good Hus∣bandry and Care is seen to be over them: And all whom he hath, or may ordain to be Instruments and Servants in this blessed work, he ever did and doth maintain them, never suffering them to lack Food and Rayment,
things necessary both for this Life and that which is to come: But none that keep within the bounds of the lead∣ings and guidings of his blessed spirit, did ever covet Silver or Gold, or Preach for filthy Lucre-sake: And now the Lord of Heaven and Earth, hav∣ing prepared by his Eternal spirit and power such a Ministry again, and sent forth into the Nations, who have no such thing in their Eye to draw them out of filthy Lucre; but purely and clearly do seek the honour and glory of God, and the good and well-being of people. This makes the corrupt and false Teachers of the Nation, who are made so by man in the Worlds spirit and wisdom, being drawn out for filthy Lucre sake; and in more then ordinary manner, coveting after Silver and Gold; this makes these Diviners mad: The day of Christ being so clear∣ly come, and the man of sin (their Master) so clearly revealed, and a Testimony so clearly goes out against them; that their Master the man of sin in all his Transformations, though he
appear in them and they in him, as Ministers of righteousness, and by all the best arts and cunning in perverting and wresting the holy mens Testi∣monies by private Interpretations, ad∣ding to, and deminishing from the Pro∣phesies thereof: And seemingly by casting mists and fogs before peoples Eyes, they turn the very end and tendency of the holy mens Testi∣monies and Prophesies left upon re∣cord, to another use then what they were intended and given forth by the moving of Gods holy Spirit for: And this they do partly through Ignorance, being so wilfully, to hide their Cor∣rupt, Proud, Arrogant, Covetous and Idolatrous practices under. And let all whose desires are after the knowledge of the Lord, and the peace and rest of their Souls in that unspeakable comfort and joy, in that life which is everlasting; take but a view of the blessed motions of Gods holy Spirit through holy men in old time, as is left upon record: And com∣pare the Covetous, Idolatrous practices
of the false Teachers of the Nation, and see how unlike the good they are; and how just like the wicked they are. Gen. 4. Cain, who was of that wicked one; he offered, but unto his Offering the Lord had no respect: Abel offered in Faith, 1 Joh. 3.12. and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his Offering: And Cain was Wrath, and envyed him, and Murdered him, because his own works wereevil, and his Brothers righteous. See your Father all you Persecutors about Religion, and the ground of his wick∣edness. And the Lord said, my Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh, and God shortned his dayes; Gen. 6. and said, every imagi∣nation of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually; for all flesh had corrupted his way, and the Earth is filled with violence through them: These were the effects of fleshly motions; But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord; and read what blessed effects his moving therein had.
The false Prophets moving in a flattering lying Spirit, inticed Ahab to go on to his Destruction: Micah the true Prophet moving in the Spirit, 2 Chron. 18. of Truth, and for speaking the Truth, was Imprisoned, and Fed with Bread and Water: The lying Prophets for lying, flattering and dissembling are at Liberty. Mordicai being one of the Lords people, he could not be moved to bow to Haman, nor do him re∣verence, Esther 3. though he was told by the Kings Servants often that he transgressed the Kings command: This filled Haman with wrath, and in his wicked motion he sought the destruction of Mordicai and all his people; but read what became of him and his motion. Read what dreadful effects the wicked fleshly motions of the Sodomites had; Gen. 19. and the blessed effects of Lot's righte∣ous motions against their wickedness.
Read what the false Prophets mo∣ved for; and how the true Prophet was moved to cry against them, Isaiah 56.10, 11. and said, They are all dumb dogs; yea, they are greedy dogs, which can never have enough: They all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter: And he did not rail in saying so, he spoke the Truth. Read what wicked motions there was in the flesh, and the motion of the true Prophet against them; said he, They were as fed Horses, every one neighed after his neigh∣bours Wife: Jer. 5. The Prophets pro∣phesie falsly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so; and what will ye do in the end thereof? Read the true Prophets motion in the word of Truth against the false fleshly Prophets motion; Who moved for handfuls of Barley and pieces of Bread; Ezek. 13. Read how wicked they were: The wicked false Teachers in this Age, have
a larger and richer Trade; they move for Thousands of Pounds. The true Prophet moving in the Truth, cryed out against the horrible wicked fleshly motions of the Priests; and said, As troops of Robbers wait for a man, Hosea 6. so the compa∣ny of Priests murder in the way by consent; for they commit lewd∣ness: Observe they were agreed in their motion. Read the wicked motions of a wicked spirit in the Presidents, Princes, Governours, Counsellers, who moved the King to make an unalter∣alterable Decree to insnare Daniel, Dan. 7. because he was Ho∣nest and Just: And though Daniel was acquainted therewith, and knew the penalty; yet he was moved in a good Spirit to open his Windows and pray as before: And read what be∣came of the motions of the wicked; and also of the blessed motions. The good Spirit in the Prophet moved him to testify against the false Spirits motions, both in head and tail:
Said he, The heads thereof judge for re∣ward, and the Priests there∣of teach for Hire, Mic. 3.1. and the Prophets thereof Divine for Money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Oh the presumption and confidence of wick∣ed motions; and observe how hireling Priests were cryed out against in for∣mer dayes, as well as in these last dayes. Christ in his Doctrine gave people warning, To beware of the Scribes, which love to go in long Clothing, and love Salutations in the Market places, Mark 12. and the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and the up∣permost Rooms at Feasts: Which de∣vour Widows houses, and for a pretence make long Prayers: But they are worse that make Widows, and devour Estates; examine the Jailers Calen∣ders for near 30 years last past. Acts the 20. The Apostle was mo∣ved by a good Spirit to declare what should come after him; saying, For I
know this, that after my departing shall grievous Wolves enter in among you; not sparing the Flock. And what a won∣derful motion this wicked generati∣on have had for near this 30 years, let all them that have heard and seen, and are more moderate and wise in heart, judge. 1 Joh. 2. There you may read that there was then many Antichrists, and the evil motions of that wicked Spirit, the which was then in the World. Chap. 4.3. was to deny Christ's coming in flesh. And John being in the Spirit on the Lords day, had wonderful things re∣vealed unto him; both of the Beasts rising out of the Sea, and out of the Earth; Revelation and with what swelling Pride he ex∣alted himself over the Saints and Servants of the Lord God: And how that Kings agreed to give their strength and power unto the Beast with one mind, to make War with the Lamb; and the Lamb shall overcome them: For he is Lord of Lords, and King of
Kings, and they that are with him are blessed, and chosen, and faithful: And he saw the downfall of Babylon, and the End of the Beast and false Prophet: Read chap. 19. And this is coming to pass, and must be fulfilled, glory, praises and honour be given to the Lord God forever. And thus unprejudiced Reader, who hath some Breathings after the knowledge of the Lord, and canst not take up a rest in a sinful state, but desires that true Judgment may go forth: Here is plain Truth, and also some brief instances therein, which is but few to what might be given from Genesis to the Revelations, of the wick∣ed Spirits motions, and their Effects; and of the blessed motions of Gods good Spirit, and their Effects; by which thou mayest see, by the fruits and practices, who are of that brood and generation of Cain and his fol∣lowers; and who are of the generati∣on of Abel and his followers: And what a wicked, proud, arrogant Spirit that is, which dares presume to limit the
moving of Gods holy Spirit in its Re∣velation, Operation and Divine Inspi∣ration. And by which wicked and presumptuous works, that proud, am∣bitious and aspiring Spirit, hath turned the very end and tendency of the love and mercy of God in the moving of this holy Spirit through holy Men, in giving forth those blessed Testimo∣nies and Prophesies in Scriptures, even quite to another use, then intended. And how the Antichristian Spirit, which was in the World in the Apo∣stles dayes, wrought in a Mistery of Iniquity, and in Confessions and Pro∣fessions from the true witnesses Testi∣mony; that Christ was come into the World, and how he was Born, and how he Suffered, and was Ascended, and will come again (which is all true.) But under this fair covering, the Mer∣chants of Babylon set up their Trades, and fraighted their Vessels with the Whores Trumpery, and with fair Speeches and good Words, out of the Life, out of the Power; they have de∣luded poor Souls, making Merchandize
of them; setting up that which is pro∣fitable in the way of righteousness, for the way of righteousness; and so ex∣cluded the second coming of Christ in Spirit to them that look and wait for him without sin unto Salvation: This great mistery, the which is Christ in us the hope of Glory, the way of Truth and Life, the way of Righte∣ousness unto the Father, out of which none can come unto him; this by their Arts they have wholly excluded: And thus having set the Scripture for a chief rule, and only rule of Life; they have excluded the Spirit of Truths guide and leadings, the which the Scripture directs unto; and so set the Scriptures above the Spirit, by the moving of which they were given forth: And the Words and Writings of the Scripture, they have set up, for the word it self. And this Spirit hav∣ing put the Declaration and Writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John for the Gospel; here the Gospel, the power of God, that is excluded, and Christ the word of God in the heart
and mouth, that is excluded: And thus having turned the Scripture up∣side down; The man of sin, the Son of Perdition; 2 Thes. 2.3. who opposeth and exalteth him∣self above all that is called God; sitteth in the Temple of God, shew∣ing himself that he is God: And now saying in effect, that the day of Christ is past, as touching his appearance and coming in the flesh, he is at a remote∣ness or distance from his people. Now Revelations are ceased, say they, and the best term they can give the Light in man, is to call it a Natural Light: So Natural and Brutish is man∣kind become, through the works of the enemy; and in this Natural State, reading the Scriptures, having put the moving of Gods Spirit a far off from them, by which alone the things of Cod therein are understood: They in that Natural Estate, doth not un∣derstand what they read, neither can they receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto them: Oh people be admonished to
come down to the Light of Christ in you, that makes manifest the deeds of Darkness; and as the man of sin comes to be revealed in you, by the Light of Christs Spirit, you thereby will come to the knowledge of Christs day and coming in righteousness, to make War against all unrighteousness, and to put an end to transgression, and finish sin, and bring in everlasting righteousness: So away with all pri∣vate Interpretations and vain Imagi∣nations, and come to the universal love of God that Spirit or Light; the which makes manifest that which is re∣proveable, and turn at his reproof, and he will pour out his Spirit upon you: And thus by the coming of the day of Christ, the day of the wicked will be seen, and the Bed of Torment they must lye down in, who go on in wick∣edness, opposing the Spiritual ap∣pearance of Christ Jesus: Oh sad will their day be, who persist in their pre∣sumption of mocking and scoffing at the moving of Gods holy Spirit now adayes; that is a proud arrogant Spi∣rit,
which will lead all that follow it to the end, to misery, contempt and shame; and at length to everlasting destruction. Blessed are they that are not defiled with it: And therefore be admonished to put your whole trust in God; and wait for the appearance of his grace, that you may have Salt and Savour in your selves; or else, not∣withstanding you may talk high things of what you read in Scriptures, yet if you be not regenerated and born of the Spirit, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And thus in the Leading, Guiding, Operation, Re∣velation and Divine Inspiration of the Blessed Spirit of Truth, am I mo∣ved to give Testimony to the Truth and way of Life and Peace, in true love to all the Creation of God, for the undeceiving of deceived and de∣luded Souls, that their understandings may be cleared of Darkness and Er∣ror; and that they may know the Truth as it is in Jesus, and be saved.

A Tender Greeting to the Flock of Christ in Bed∣fordshire and Hunting∣tonshire. Dear Friends, IN the everlasting Seed, Power and Life, keep the substance of all sig∣nified in Ages past, under many Types, Figures and Shadows, now known and dwelt in by them who have believed the good report of the holy men of God, which is left upon record, who was redeemed from the Earthly part; even that they might be Gods witnesses of his Heavenly gift, wherein is all the Treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid; which Treasure hath been freely opened un∣to us, who through faithfulness and diligent waiting, have expected the
same, as a sure reward of the bounty and goodness of our Creator for ever. So that all the obedient and upright hearted can truly say, for ever be the day had in remembrance, when we were awakned out of Carnal Security, we had in vain Customs and Traditi∣ons of men in the Fall; who have sought out many Inventions, through which comes blindness, hardness of heart, and unbelief; from whence proceeds envying, hatred, malice, un∣cleanness, and all other evils whatso∣ever: He who is Prince of Darkness, having his Power and Authority there in blindness and darkness, carries the Creature into bondage at his will, he being ruler in the Children of disobe∣dience: But glory and praises be to the Lord our God, who is the great God, and besides him there is none: It's he alone that opens the under∣standings of them that fear him; who hath discovered unto us, the Mistery of the workings of Satan, and the bredth and length of his rule and do∣minion, and the end thereof; for ever
is he who thus opens unto them that fear him, greatly to be admired by all his Sons and Daughters, who are redeemed by his great power out of Adam in the Fall, up into him that never fell, through whom we have access into his presence, the which sweetens all to us, and carries all that truly trust in him through all Tempests and Storms whatsoever: Even by his Arm and Power, who will and can appease and lay all Tempests and Storms when they have accomplished that for which they were suffered to be raised, he being seen and known who walkes upon a troubled Sea; as in dayes past, so yesterday, and to day, and for ever. So Dear Friends, keep out his appearance, who would work questionings and reasonings con∣cerning the Rod of the wicked, with which the Righteous are threatned: (It's for the Fire) (It's for the Fire) that's Gods Word: So all to abide faithful in his power, by whom all appearances of the wicked one may be resisted in his many wills, who is
a Murderer and a Thief; who walkes about in the Earthly mind, compas∣sing there, and betraying there; and draws back into the Earth there: And then when tryals come, the Earth is in the way; and then the false ballance is set up in the heart, and the precious Jewel being weighed therein, the Earth that appears heaviest, and so carries the sway in the mind, and so comes to be set up in the heart: So thereby many come to lose the everlasting reward of peace, and joy, and comfort, which is in that Life which lives and abides for ever: So Dear Friends, have an Eye to the re∣ward of well doing; even that Pearl of great Price, and let it have domi∣nion in the heart, and the Earth set under all; that so we may continue to the end in all well-doing; and patient and meek running in that race which is set before us, unto whom belongs the Crown of Immortal Life. When the Lord pleases to shew me a clear way unto you, I shall be willing to see your Faces, to the end that we
may be refresht together; even from that everlasting Fountain, from whence comes all our fresh springs which glads the Souls of the upright for ever: But at present I find my Testimony re∣quired, where I have had the greatest time of my Conversation in the ever∣lasting Covenant of Truth, Light and Life. That wicked ruler who rules in the Children of disobedience, hath many Agents here abouts, as well as in o∣ther places, who have been at work amongst us: They took from me six Cows, for a Fine of 20 l. for speak∣ing the things of God according to his will, (but they had great trouble with them:) From my Brother John nine Cowes, for a Silent Meeting at his house; and from another all his Beds, Cloaths, two Geldings, Pewter, Brass, Leather, and abundance of other things, to the value, as is supposed, of near 50 l. for a Silent Meeting at his House: At Kingston on Thames, Friends have had abundance taken from them, and they kept out of their Meeting
place, and not suffered to stand quiet∣ly in the Streets; but some were taken and sent to Prison, and others drove about by Souldiers in a barbarous manner; and several other Fines have been levyed, too long to mention: And Meetings being disturbed, Friends being haled out, &c. all which works for good to them that truly fear and obey the voice of the Living God: The more they strive, the more doth Power and Life appear; which keeps Friends Clear, Sweet and Innocent; even to love God above all, and their Neighbours as themselves, greatly de∣siring that they may see a necessity of building upon the same Rock; even Christ Jesus, who is the power of God, and wisdom of God, who feeds all that truly hunger with spiritual Meat, and all them that truly thirst with spi∣ritual Drink; him who was glorified with the Father in the beginning, by whom all things were made, who con∣tinues the same yesterday, to day, and for ever: Through whom Friends Meetings in these parts are fresh, lively
and constant: But the great Boasters, as Presbyterians, Independants and Bap∣tists, who have kicked against the Everlasting Covenant of Late in their own hearts, yet in their Imaginations have said they would follow Christ, &c. But they now, as in days past, when the storm was up, are drove into their holes: But they would not be∣lieve it in days past, before the storm was seen, when it was testified unto them: But they are Foxes, they can cover themselves no more; if they turn not to the Truth now, they stand in danger of being swallowed up in dark∣ness for ever. So Dear Friends, that which con∣cerns us, is to be thankful, and to meet often together, that so we may grow up together, even from one de∣gree to another of an Heavenly ap∣pearnce of him in whom is all glory; that so we may bear his Heavenly Image for ever. So in true watchful∣ness, keep over all the appearanes of the Enemy: And in true love and tenderness, keep watchful over one
another; seeking one anothers good, and the strong bearing with the weak, that so all may be preserved in the way of the upright, out of all evil; that so we may be sanctified through∣out in Soul, Body and Spirit, even to the glory and praise of the great God, who made all things at his pleasure; who hath appointed times and seasons and bounds to all: Whose work is great which he is bringing to pass, and in vain do the herds strive againt it; of a certain he will dash them to pieces: So in the Ever∣lasting Seed is my Dear Love unto all, who loves and obeys the appearance of him who brings Salvation, who is over all, blessed for ever and ever. Stephen Smith. Pirbright, the 8th. day of the 5th. Month, 1670.
An Answer to a Paper, called, The Christians Vow in Baptism. A Paper coming to my hands, In∣tituled, The Christians Vow in Baptism, Explicated and Re∣newed; given forth by an unknown Author, who is crept into his hole again, from whence he brought that bundle; which upon due considera∣tion he will have cause to be ashamed of, being works of Darkness; where many words are used out of the wis∣dom of God, the which hath a ten∣dency of darkning and hiding Gods Counsel from mankind; and there∣fore that I may be clear in this matter, in giving check to that high presump∣tion manifestly shown in the said Paper as above, is this given forth.
First, He calls it, The Christians Solemn Vow; afterwards he saith, let the remembrance of the Vow of God in Baptism: Something he would have it, but he knows not what; and so he colours it over with many Scrip∣tures, wherein Gods Covenant with man is expressed; where he tumbles new and old together, as one igno∣rant of him from whence both came, and therefore unlike to have the knowledge of either. So now as one high flown in Ima∣ginations, undertakes to make a Co∣venant for others: But the better to colour over and usher in his Babel, he takes many of the true Prophets words, and therewith decks himself over, that he may appear the more beautiful in the sight of his good Masters. A thing highly esteemed of by man; but was, and is an abomination in the sight of the Lord. But to begin with some of his words: Oh wonderful grace, when thou hadst forfeited all, and wert no more his by nature, then the Devils and damned in Hell!
Answer, In this Confession, what a humble man doth he appear to be; see where he sets you who are con∣cerned with him, even equal with the Devils nature, and damned in Hell. What a rare Arts-man this would be, if he could make the Devils nature good; by saying over so many words as he hath ordered in his Paper: But in the dark where he is foaming and tumbling about in an endless work, seeking to make the Devils na∣ture good, which alwayes was, and is bad and envious against good: There he is left bound till he repent of his presumption. Now to Esau's Pottage, which is ushered in as a Prayer after his manner; the which he would have all to fol∣low, either in that Image, or as like it as he can. But let all wise people consider, and compare the true Pro∣phets Prayers with his: The true Pro∣phet taught his followers to Pray, Our Father, &c. as you may read, every word being of great weight, But all you who are followers of this
Imaginary man in his works of Dark∣ness, see what a broad way your leader hath found, to tell over a pennyworth of Prayers, and then you are fit for his invented marriage; and in case you should lose that Paper, you may buy a pennyworth of another sort somewhat like it: So passing by much of his supposed goodly stuff, come to the Marriage Bond in his words: And do here solemnly joyn my self in a Marriage Covenant unto him. Oh blessed Jesus, I come to thee hungry and hardly bestead, poor, and wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked; a most loathsom poluted Wretch, a guilty condemned Malefactor, unworthy for ever to wash the Feet of the Servants of my Lord, much more to be married to the King of Glory: But such is thine unparalleled love, I do here with all my power accept thee, and take thee for my Head and Husband. Did you ever hear of a more Loathsom, Impudent Harlot, who in all her filthiness and abominations, presumes to say that God is her Husband: Oh high pre∣sumption,
which arises from the nature of the Devil; this is made indeed in the Earthly wisdom, and there ratified, the which I leave all you to judge who do return in some degree or measure the Divine, Pure, Holy nature of the Son of Righteousness, into which all do grow; and so take a view of the Heavenly Marriage of the Heavenly man, and compare it with that loath∣some conceited marriage, Revel. 19. Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her self ready: And to her was granted, that she should be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and White; for the Linnen is the Righteousness of Saints, &c. Alleluja, for the Lord God Omni∣potent reigneth; here is a Heavenly melody: Had the Author of that Pa∣per been so Ingenious to have come to that Marriage Supper, he might have partaken of the Heavenly joy and com∣fort, and not have been left to that great confusion manifested in that Paper: For the Invitation unto it hath
gone throughout the Nation, that they that would come, might come, for the Fountain to wash and prepare for it, hath been and is open, glory to God for ever. But further, see the confusion of the Author of that Paper in these words: And the Covenant which I have ratified on Earth, let it be ratified in Heaven: What, after the Marriag is concluded, to be made? What work is this? he hath ratified it on Earth, and would have it done so in Heaven? but whether he will or no, it seems he doth not know; so all is left in doubt and fear again: What a sad bargain you have made all this while; who spent your Money and time after such Idle Immaginary do∣ings. Now all you who have seen and read the Authors supposed Covenant, be so Ingenious to read how God was pleased to give forth his Law and Co∣venants, the which he ratified in Hea∣ven; and compare them with the Au∣thors pretended Covenant which he ratified on Earth, without any know∣ledge
of the parties consent, he pre∣tends to be concerned; let any prove the contrary if they can, and let him shew if he can in all the Scriptures of Truth, where God ever left it to vain man to make a Covenant to be bind∣ing to all others in that manner, &c. That many did vow obedience, and were incouraged in the Covenant of the Lord, that is true and manifest through the Testimonies of the Prophets; but where did any presume to bind God in that manner? Oh gross Idolatry; But the blessed holy God at all times and seasons, according to his blessed plea∣sure and good will to mankind, did give forth his Law and Commands, and so Covenanted to be the God of his people, to keep them in Peace, &c. On condition of their living in obe∣dience to his will and pleasure mani∣fest in his time and season, as you may read, Deut. 5. and Exod. 19. The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Ho∣reb: The Lord talked with them face to face in the Mount, in the midst of the fire; which caused a fear and trembling:
These words the Lord spake unto all your Assembly, &c. and he wrote them in two tables of stone: Wherein the Lord shewed his glory and greatness; and they said, we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth: So the Law was added because of trans∣gressions till the Seed should come, Gal. 3.19. So Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousness for every one that be∣lieveth, Rom. 10.3. But concerning the first Covenant which God made with his people when he shewed fa∣vour and love; In taking them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, Heb. 8. Because they continued not in my Co∣venant, I regarded them not, saith the Lord: But now mark that second Covenant which is without fault: After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People: And they shall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, saying, know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the
greatest: For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more: Oh for ever blessed is this Covenant, there is no fault in it; and that it is a bad nature indeed by which Imaginary Covenants are made, which hath a tendency of drawing peoples minds out from waiting to know this blessed Covenant in the mind and heart: So to the sober and wise in heart I write, that they may weigh these weighty things in a true ballance, and from thence give forth true judgment. And mind further the Authors words: This Covenant you are advised to make not only in heart, but in word, not only in word, but in writing: Sure he thinks all's done; but if that must be made or written in the heart, then there will be no room for Gods Cove∣nant, for that doth not at all agree with that confused stuff; and what pity it is that any should be deprived of Gods righteous Covenant, since Gods love is universally tendered therein, and inviteth all unto it, that
they may partake of its pure, holy na∣ture to convert sinners, and make wise simple and Ignorant people, who are ready to perish for want of know∣ledge; the which is communicated to them that fear God, and wait to feel his blessed promise to extend his mercy and goodness therein, to overcome and give victory over that which is evil and corrupt: But further he ad∣viseth; To spread the writing before the Lord, as if you would present it to him as your act and deed: So here is an act and no act, sometimes presumed to be done and ratified, then again in doubtful terms; as if you would do so, &c. And saith the Author, when you have done this, set your hand to it. Answer, so you may stand to it be∣loved, whilst he that exhorts you runs away, Fox-like, creeping into his hole, &c. why is not his hand to it. Note further, Keep it, saith he, as a memorial of the solemn transactions that have passed between God and you. Answer, Since God here is made party concerned; you that concern your
selves therein, had need know when and how God appeared unto you; sure else (if you be not wilfully blind) you will see all that stuff to be meer Imaginations, if you cannot see them to be Devilish Inventions, the which indeed they are; Now take this last advice in these words: That you may have recourse unto it in Doubts and Temptations; what think you now, either the Paper must be an Idol, or Christ? It is not Christ, therefore it must be an Idol, then the Author must be an Idolater; let them that concern themselves with it deny it if they can: Hath not this a tendency of making void the love God through Christ Jesus, who is the way to God out of doubt, and through his power and wisdom all doubts are resolved; who also is the succourer of them that are tempted, and the deliverer of them who are guided by him out of tempta∣tions; into his holy Name all are to be Baptized, Dipped, Plunged, that Sin and Iniquity may be brought under, and consumed by Fire and his holy Spirit;
which is the one true Baptism, through and by him who is to increase in all his Blessed Office as Priest to Minister according to the necessities of all that come unto him, as proper to open the Mysteries that are hid from the Wise and Prudent; a Bishop to oversee what is lacking in the Church, a Shepherd to lead his Flock in an out, and to Feed them in Green Pastures of Life and Peace, a Physitian to heal the Wounded, a Prince to give forth his Righteous Laws and Decrees in his Church; where his Righ∣teous, Holy Laws are written in the Heart, is to be read and spread before all, that all who are met in his holy Name, may partake of his Divine Nature, and so become Heirs of his everlasting Kingdom, which never shall have end: So Blessed are they who be∣lieve in God, and do not make haste, but wait patiently for the fulfilling of his pro∣mise; that you may be delivered and kept from Worshipping the Inventions of men: So in good will to all who have a desire to Truth is this given forth by. Stephen Smith. The 27th day of the 8th. Month 1673.
An Answer to a Paper called, The Gospels Glory. A Paper Intituled, The Gospels Glory, or the Covenant of Grace; and Grace of the Covenant, Ʋnfolded. And for the better understanding of them who Impartially desire to know the Truth as it is in Jesus, is this brief Answer given. The Blessed Gospel of Christ, glad Tydings of Christ, The Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth; Rom. 1.16, 17. therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith: This was preached unto Abraham which was hundreds of years before Moses, and therefore so long before
his Writings: And the same blessed Gospel they which are of the same faith with blessed Abraham, Gal. 2.8. are blessed with him in the knowledge of; this is in∣visibly to be felt and seen, to expel the Clouds of darkness and error, and to rent the vail thereof; and to break down the Partition wall which is made up through sin and iniquity; and thus to finish sin and put an end to transgression, and to bring in ever∣lasting righteousness; and herein is the righteousness of the law fulfilled in them that believe, through the Go∣spel of Christ, he being the end of the law for righteousness to them that be∣lieve: And in this invisible glorious work in opening the understandings of them that believe, is the glory of the Gospel manifestly shew∣ed: 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the God of the World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, least the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God,
should shine unto them; so unbelief is the cause why people have not the knowledge of the Gospel which the Apostle was not ashamed of, it being the power of God unto salvation, the power of a Saviour, the wisdom of a Saviour, Christ Jesus the Heavenly man: In his blessed spiritual ap∣pearance for the refreshing of every truly hungering and thirsting soul after his righteousness: Paul to the Galatians saith, the Gospel which was preached of me is not after man; Gal. 1.11, 12. for I nei∣ther received it of man, nei∣ther was I taught it, but by the revela∣tion of Jesus Christ; so that the blessed Gospel is an inward glorious work, wrought by the Spirit and power of Christ Jesus, the foundation of all the Prophets and Apostles; on which the true believers were and are built, to the praise and honour of God for ever. And whereas he saith, the grace of the Covenant unfolded; therein he shows what birth he is of, which
might fitter be imployed in its Poetry, in making of Balads, then to be found so presumptuous in affirming the grace of the Covenant unfolded in that dark (imaginary stuff in that Paper.) The grace of God being an invi∣sible appearance of Gods holy Spirit unto all mankind, which is testified to Paul and Titus: For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men, (Teaching us, &c.) So here was and is the universal love of God to all mankind; not willing that any should perish, but that all might know the Truth and be saved: So in that the grace of God appears unto all, the renders of his love is therein shewed to all without respect of persons: That in every Nation they that fear God and work righteousness through the blessed operation of the grace of his holy Spirit, such are accepted of him: So than they are in the way of a bles∣sing, who believe in God, and wait in a full assurance: And trust in him, for the knowledge of the infallible teachings of grace, whereby way is
ministred unto a growth in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus: And thus far the Apostle did unfold the love of God, from what he had handled, felt seen, of the mercies and riches of Gods great love to all mankind therein, be∣ing a true witness of the love of God through the grace of his holy Spirit; by and in which the good of all was and is sought, but indeed there be but few that doth regard it, though his hand of love be stretcht out all the day long: There be so many false Teachers, who by good Words and fair Speeches deceives poor simple ig∣norant people, through their great flourishing words about the grace of God; out of the sensible feeling of its blessed vertue and power in its in∣fallible Teachings and thereby bring∣ing Salvation: And though this love of God hath appeared to all, all have not the knowledge thereof, as they had and have, who are true believers in God: As said the Apostle to Ti∣tus, Teaching us, so true believers
Baptized by one blessed Spirit into one body; and therein being re∣ceived into Gods holy Covenant of grace, cannot but cry out; Oh the vertue of Christ Jesus by whom comes grace and truth, which is of a healing nature, glad tydings indeed unto wounded Souls, and none can be fur∣ther truly sensible of the unfolding of this love of God, to the refreshing and comforting of their immortal Souls, but by the feeling of its vertue and power, to quicken, revive and raise up out of sin and iniquity the cause of death. And in his Poetry he saith; Gods works preach not redemption from Hell, the name of Christ there is not legible. Ans. And in and by all Gods power∣ful and glorious works; both within man and without, is the blessed and powerful name of Christ to be read and understood: So its Gods works alone that preach redemp∣tion from the power of Hell and death, 2 Cor. 5.19. and there∣in is Christs holy name legible: But
as it is written, that which is born of flesh is flesh, and so a heap of fleshly works are in that Paper, to the shame of the Author, in giving them that Title, &c. And as that which is born of flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the spirit is spirit; and these two births are contrary, for the birth of the flesh, though it may speak great swel∣ling words, and tell of the victory of Christ, and triumph in swelling words of his fame, as in that Paper; yet it being a worker of iniquity, it must have that Sentence, depart from me; it can in no wise inherit the Kingdom of God, though it may glory and say, I have preached and done many things, yet its product is but spiritual wick∣edness got in a high place, which the indignation of the Lord is against, so it must be cast out; he that can re∣ceive it let him. And thus much might be said as to the words in that Paper; but to all Impartial readers this is sufficient, to convince them that that Paper is none of the Gospels glory, nor none of the
Covenant of grace, neither is the Co∣venant of grace at all there unfolded? But it is a meer parcel of conceivings from the same imaginary spirit, that uses to be Imployed about making of Ballads. And so in true love to all unto whom this may come, I counsel you to mind the fear of offending God, that you may be made sensible of the blessed appearance of the grace of Gods holy Spirit, that you may be received into the blessed Covenant thereof, and therein be witness of its sufficiency, in teaching what to deny, and what to do, this being the means ordained of God for the good of all, and all that becomes sensible of the infallible teachings of the grace of God; such will not wonder at Silent Meetings, as many do who are out of the sense of Gods love therein; many such grow despisers, and won∣der, and cannot believe the effectual works of the grace of Gods holy Spi∣rit, though in the demonstration and power thereof, they be declared and
published from time to time: And I wish all to take heed of being exalted through vain glory in fleshly works, the which are attended with sorrow and misery, and will bring all them that rest there to the end, but in the Lord is everlasting glory. And mind the saying of the Apostle to the Ephesians; But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us; even when we were dead in sins, hath he quickned us together with Christ, by grace yea are saved; So mind the blessed teachings of the grace of God which is pure, holy and perfect in every de∣gree, and this the mark which all should set before them as they expect to run well in their Heavenly race, and obtain the blessed peace of God to their Souls, which is the will of God; and in the knowledge thereof I give this Testimony, who am what I am by Cods Grace, and therein a well wisher to all who are truly seek∣ing after the knowledge of Cod, in which love I rest, Stephen Smith. The 11th. day of the 11th. Month, 1674.
A Testimony to the way of Truth and Life, with seasonable Ex∣hortations thereunto. THat which hath been of low degree and little esteem with mankind; now is the Lord God exalting and will exalt and set over all; the blessed Way, Truth and Life, Christ the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, the blessed way of the Lord opened unto the wise in heat, but ever was and is a mistery shut and hid from the wicked; the Vultures eye hath not seen it, nor the unclean cannot enter into it; but a Fountain is opened (praise to the Lord for ever) to wash and to cleanse from sin and iniquity, and so to sift and prepare for the way of Truth and
Life. Blessed are they who trust in the Lord, and keep their minds stay∣ed upon the blessed manifestation of his light, and love and mercy unto them therein, with their eye single unto the Lord, whose blessed springs of life and true refreshment, will in the Lords time and season rise in the hearts of such, to the great consolati∣on, and peace, and rest of their Souls; whom the Spirit of the Lord will guide unto the knowledge and understan∣ding the pure and unchangable Re∣ligion which comes from above, where the true Worship which Christ did and doth set up in the Spirit and Truth, will be witnessed: And this being possessed and enjoyed, all the false Religions and Worships which are out of the way of Truth and Life will be discovered; and keeping low in the silence of the earthly and sen∣sual wisdom, wisdom which is pure from above will be manifest, and herein the works of the blessed day of the Lord will be seen, who is work∣ing a reformation in the Earth, in re∣storing
the blessed language of Truth, and setting up Truth, and Righteous∣ness, and Mercy, and Peace; and bringing a people to a pure language to speak the Truth, from the guidings and leadings of the Spirit of Truth, which was Prophesied of; That the Lord would power out of his Spirit up∣on all flesh, Sons and Daughters: And the glory of the Lord shall be revea∣led, and all flesh shall see it together: Blessed are they who believe and trust in the Lord, and patiently wait for the fulfilling of his promise, for the Lord will assuredly stain the glory∣ing of all the fleshly births; and create and bring forth a spiritual birth, unto which all his blessed promises are: And the Kingdoms of this World shall become the Lords and his Christs, and he shall reign for ever; and he will exalt his everlasting Kingdom, and of the increase of his Govern∣ment there shall be no end: This peaceable Kingdom of the Son of his love, is in righteousness, peace and joy in his holy Spirit; whose Taber∣nacle
is with men, and the Ark and the Testimony, and the Mercy Seat over all his works, where he doth commune with them; he takes plea∣sure in and makes known his good will and pleasure unto mankind, who receiving freely, communicates free∣ly the good will and pleasure of the Lord; here is the Wine and Milk without Money or Price: And the Spirit saith come, and the Bride saith come, and he that heareth saith come, and he that will come let him come, and take of the water of life freely for a fountain is open where life ma∣nifests it self freely; and the streams of Babylon are drying up, where the Whore with her guilded Cup of Sor∣ceries and Witchcraft hath sat; a Cup of Wormwood and Gaul is fil∣ling to her, and a Bed of Torment will be the portion of her Merchants, and all that receive her mark, and wear it on their forehead, or in the hand: So blessed are they who do escape out of Babylon, and set their faces towards Zion the holy City,
where the substance is injoyed, and that which was figured and typified in the Law and Covenant given forth in Mount Sinai, in the Gospel in Mount Sion is possessed the blessed Law and Covenant, in the Mind and in the Heart, Christ in us the hope of Glory, the Substance; and herein that which the Lord hath ordained for peace is witnessed, and in and by this great Ordinance are all Ordi∣nances necessary to Salvation clearly understood: So blessed are they who cease from their own vain labour and works, and believe and wait upon the Lord to partake of his glorious works, to expel the clouds of dark∣ness, and to command his Light to shine out of it in the heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ; here's the pure powerful foun∣dation which God hath laid for all mankind to believe in and build up∣on, and all that labour in darkness to comprehend what the Light is, its all vain labour; though Light doth
shine in darkness, yet darkness can∣not comprehend it; and Christ knew what he said, when he said, I am the Light of the World, though the World through malice, envy and prejudice are so corrupted and darkened, that he is become unto them a stumbling stone and a rock of offence, yet he is the Light of the World, and doth light the Candle of the wicked: but when the wicked are lighted, and their wickedness manifest, they of∣ten hate Light that makes manifest their wickedness, and puts out the Candle, and so adds sin to sin in get∣ting covers to hide their transgressi∣on: And to such the hands of the Lord is stretched out in the love and mercy to them, but all gain-sayers of it do turn into vanity, calling good evil, and evil good, light darkness, and darkness they call light, and herein they reject love and mercy, and im∣brace hatred, and lay other founda∣tions which the Lord hath not laid, and so labour in vain, and build in vain, which are all for the fire, and
must be destroyed, the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Oh that peo∣ple would consider and be wise, and not go on to provoke the Lord to shut them out into utter darkness; for out of darkness people are invited to turn to the Light, and from Satans power unto God, that they may have a sense and knowledge of his love and mercy, who gives remission of sins to them who truly and unfeignedly re∣pent of them, and forsake them, ap∣proving themselves before him in so doing, and imbraceth that love and mercy and good will therein, and so watching and walking in his light there will be more light and under∣standing given of his way, truth and life, the which he is making known in the Earth and his Salvation among his people. Therefore be admonished not to provoke him, and harden your hearts against his reproofs, for in so doing you will be more and more confounded, and your bonds of corruption in dark∣ness will be made stronger, and when
his good Spirit hath done striving, and the light and councel thereof be taken from you, then will you be left in utter darkness where is weeping and gnashing of Teeth: For of a Truth the Lord is risen in great power to break down all the pleasant pictures and likenesses which mankind in their corrupt wills and affection have made of Religions and Worships, and through their dark immaginary works therein, they have opposed the Lords making known the true Religion and the true Worship which Christ did and doth set up in his Spirit of Truth, and is standing and remains firm and unchangeable. And therefore in the bowels of love I admonish all you who are not come to a true sense and experience of the Lords good will and pleasure in making known his way, Truth and Life, but are in some tenderness in panting after the Lord for the know∣ledge of his good will and pleasure therein: I desire you to be perswa∣ded to consider whether you have be∣lieved
in the Light that comes from him, and leads to him; and if you were true believers in God and in his Christ, then you cannot deny the ma∣nifestation of love and light that comes from him; for what is known of God is manifest in us, he shews it unto: Oh its a good thing to wait up∣on the Lord in Truth, with a single eye unto him who sits with light and understanding of his blessed way, Truth and Life, Christ that was be∣fore Abraham, and was in the body which was prepared for him to do the will of his Father, in which he suffered without the Gates of Jeru∣salem by wicked hands, and rose a∣gain and shewed himself unto many hundreds of witnesses, and hath many thousand witnesses this day of his suf∣ferings and resurrection; who is the same yesterday, to day, and forever; a mistery which is hid from the worldly wise and prudent, who live in an exaltation above the pure, holy manifestation of the Light of Gods holy Spirit; and so neglecting the
one thing necessary, do live in the many things where offence to the just is given dayly, and the movings of Gods good Spirit is grieved and quenched; and then comparing them∣selves with themselves, and measur∣ing themselves by themselves, they are not wise in heart; and therefore are they shut out from the knowledge of the way of Truth and Life. Therefore I do perswade all to wait low at wisdoms gate for the opening thereof, that your hearts may be sea∣soned with grace; and then that which hath been of low degree, as to the esteem mankind hath had of it, by the savour of Gods grace, it will be beloved and esteemed, and exal∣ted; and those dark immaginary works which hath been lets and hindrances of the knowledge of the Truth, Way, and Life; they will be hated and dis∣esteemed: And things will be put in order by the true wisdom, to the praise and honour of God, and to the great peace and comfort of all the truly humble in heart: And thus in
a few plain words is this Testimony of Truth given forth for the Informa∣tion of the truly breathing and thirst∣ing Souls after the Way, Truth and Life, and the righteousness therein: The which the Lord God Almighty exalt more and more unto the break∣ing forth of the day of his perfect love unto all them that seek him in Truth, and with an upright heart. Stephen Smith. The 27th. day of the 9th. Month, 1675.
The LIFE OF CHRIST Which is the LIGHT of MEN, Exalted above the WORKS of DARKNESS. Being an Answer to a BOOK; Intituled, The Fun∣damental Error of the Quakers Detected. By an Author who hath con∣cealed his Name. Herein is proved, That men may not become Christians by following the Light within. Rom. 1.18, 19. For the wrath of God is re∣vealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the Truth in unrighteousness: Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them. Printed in the Year, 1678.
An Answer to a Book Intituled, The Foundamental Error of the Quakers detected; Or, That men do not become Christians by following the Light within, without Out∣ward Teaching, &c. THese are the works of the power of Darkness, to render the Light of Christ Jesus of it self insufficient to lead into Chri∣stianity; wherein the Author of the Book hath sufficiently manifested his folly, in undertaking to detect that for Error, which is a fundamental Truth. Indeed he hath made a bold at∣tempt in his dark comprehension, in going about to limit the leading of the Light of Christ Jesus, which
shews plainly that he is not acquain∣ted with the way thereof; and in adventuring to speak and to affirm things so confidently, that he hath no knowledge of; this bespeaks him to be a rash inconsiderate man: But least we should know him, (like a Coward) he hath concealed his Name. And in our reasonable and faithful confidence in Christ, the Way, Truth and Life, we cannot give such dark ignorant works better enter∣tainment then they deserve; and by giving of them their due entertain∣ment according to Truth, we have cause to believe the endeavors of such dark immaginary Spirits will grow weaker and weaker, and the turn∣ing of things upside down (as the Au∣thor of that Book and his Generati∣on hath done) will prove a miserable hard travel and labour, that will end in great sorrow and trouble. But to come to the business in as brief manner as may be, that I may not be tedious to the unprejudiced Reader: This short answer is recom∣mended,
shewing the drift of that dark Spirit; by answering only some particulars: Such manner of work as this having been often answered by many worthy Servants of the Lord, the which are faithful witnesses a∣gainst all such dark works. By the way let it be remembred. 1. That we truly own the holy Scrip∣tures, and all true and effectual out∣ward Teaching in their place, as pro∣ceeding from the holy Spirit. 2. That by the assistance of the same Spirit only, the Scriptures, &c. are truly to be understood and be made profi∣table. 3. This Spirit works imme∣diatly in the understanding, where ever outward means becomes ef∣fectul. 4. Divine Light and Inspira∣tion being all sufficient to teach imme∣diatly, it is not to be limited to out∣ward means. First, to prove the sufficiency of the Light of Christ Jesus to lead into true Christianity, either without out∣ward teaching, or by it: The Lord God of Heaven and Earth be his glo∣rious
and powerful outgoings in the Light, being not to be limited; take two or three instances out of the Pro∣phets concerning this blessed leader, the Light of Christ within, Psal. 97.11. Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart; and said David, rejoyce in the Lord ye righ∣teous, and give thanks at the remem∣brance of his holiness: The which many thousands do this day, (by the springing up of this ever blessed Light within) even where outward Teach∣ing is not; and by the effectual work∣ing in its powerful operation in spring∣ing up out of darkness, many who had the name of that they were not, were both convinced and converted and led into true Christianity: And Isaiah prophesying the coming of Christs kingdom, saith Isa. 2.5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord; and in the 55 chap. 4 v. Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people: And of this Covenant, this light promised to in∣lighten
the Gentiles: John the great∣est Prophet that was born of a woman, God sent to be a witness that all through him might believe, and this Testimony of the true light that ligh∣teneth every man that comes into the World, he had from God who sent him, and not man's Teaching: And Paul saith, Gal. 1.12. speaking of the Gospel: For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it; but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ: So here men were made Christians by Christ the Light of the World, with∣out outward Teaching, and this over∣throws the affirmation of the Author of that Book, who saith, That men do not become Christians by following the Light within, without outward Teach∣ing: But the Author may know that these men true Christians, and men. But I do affirm that there was never a true Christian made by mens Teaching, without the leading and guiding of the Light of Christs Spirit within; and that is by the leading of Christ within, that people are made
true Christians, and the gainsaying of the Truth is the cause there are so many false Christians now adays, by reason of such natural men as the Author of that Book manifests him∣self to be, being ignorant of the Light, not knowing the way thereof; nei∣ther doth he know the fundamental principle of the people called Qua∣kers, the which is a manifest token of the gross darkness that he is under, in that he presumes to call that error which he is a stranger to: But neither he nor any else hath yet proved our opposing the leading and guiding of the Light of Christ within, to its leadings and guidings in Teaching without: But we do oppose its blessed Leading within and Teaching with∣out, to such dark unchristian-like Spi∣rits that doth not know the way thereof; who in such like dark works in a high degree of pride and arro∣gancy, are going about to limit and set bounds to the works of the Lord God Almighty.
So that which he calls a fundamen∣tal Error, is a fundamental Truth; that it is possible with God this day and time, as well as in days past, to lead by the Son of his love into true Christianity (with (or without) out∣ward Teaching) of which Truth the Lord God hath raised abundance of living witnesses this day, and by his arm and power he is raising up more dayly, who are built upon the same foundation that the Prophets, Apo∣stles and the Primitive Christians were built upon, against which work and foundation the gates of Hell can∣not prevail. This Covenant, this Light, this Witness, this blessed Leader, (Gods love, Gods gift to the people) all mind that it did not only inspire im∣mediatly the Apostles, but also the people; by which Inspiration people come to understand when they have done evil, even when none without can accuse them; by this love wick∣ed people are made sensible of their wickedness, though indeed, as it is
written, the Candle of the wicked is often put out; yet many times they are overcome with the Light and Love of God therein, that thereby they forsake their evil (and turn from their wickedness;) and by yielding their members servants unto this righteous appearance of the grace of God, and by obeying the infal∣lible teaching thereof, many have been converted into the true Chri∣stians faith; and by the Truth sancti∣fied, and then justified through their obedience to the Heavenly gift of God are made true and living Chri∣stians, abiding the Baptism of Christ, who Baptizeth with Fire and the Ho∣ly Ghost; and therein are confirmed and settled under the shadow of his wing, whose fruit is very precious and pleasant: And it is by this Light that the voice of the true Shepherd comes to be known from the false Shepherd; thus by grubbing up the root of the tree, the branches must needs fall with it.
Page 4. He proceeds thus, viz. You know it was said by our blessed Saviour, that strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it: And I little doubt but that an appearance at first of a greater strictness and narrowness in your way, then in theirs that differs from you; was a temptation to some injudicious per∣sons, &c. Answer, If we were not in the same strait and narrow way that Christ did speak of, where we are partakers of Gods great love in that rest and peace which he hath prepared for them that believe, fear and love him, it were an easie matter to go back again into the broad way; there be opportunities enough given besides this great one given by this Author of that Book in his gross abominable Insinuations: But such is the manner of such dark Spirits, to pretend great love to the Souls of others, and are not in a capacity to pity and love their own. But he saith, That might have been escaped had we considered that the strict∣ness
and narrowness, consisting in out∣ward austerities and incivilities, &c. Answer, whither may a rambler go when he is turned into the way of mis∣chief, and pursues his journey with∣out care of what will be the end of it? But I perceive this is his great trouble as it was Hamans, Mordicai would not bow to him; we not going out of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ into the respect of persons, but faithfully keep∣ing his commands, and abiding in his Doctrine; the which is true whatso∣ever he wickedly suggests to the con∣trary: This he accounts Incivilities and a piece of Superstition of our own de∣vising; and that several orders among the Papists have been built upon the same bottom; (but mind) all this while his name is concealed, shewing that he is not willing others should know what bottom he is built upon; but who that are wise can expect any better fruit of such a corrupt tree that grows up∣on the root of Imaginations? he hath nothing else for his bottom of all that he hath said.
And he goes on in page 6, 7. in these words: Ye have taken liberty to walk loosly and cast off this yoak, and that is in not governing your spirits, passions and tongues according to the Laws of his Kingdom, &c. And this he infers from some words he hath taken out of Ed∣ward Burroughs's Book, as thou cursed, thou beast to whom the Plagues of God are due, a reprobate, a Child of dark∣ness thou art thou disobedient one, &c. Answer, By this it is manifest, that if that Author had been in the false Prophets dayes, he would have been as much offended with the true Pro∣phets for calling the false Prophets greedy dogs, and dumb dogs, and many such like words; and as David said Psal. 49.12. Man being in honour abi∣deth not, he is like the beasts that perish; or if he had been in that day of Christ, who indeed was very humble and meek, but in his reproofs of Hypo∣crisie he was very sharp, as appears in these words, Wo to you Hypocrites, likening them to whited Walls, pain∣ted Sepulchres; and he said to them
who supposed themselves to be the Children of Abraham, and that they had one Father, even God; But Christ said unto them, ye are of your Father the Devil: And he said unto the Scribes and Pharisees, ye Serpents, ye genera∣tion of Vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell? And the Apostle Paul saith, whatsoever he be that preach∣eth any other Gospel then that which we have preached unto you, let him be ac∣cursed; Here is but a hint of much that might be said, what the Language of the Spirit of Truth was in those days against those dark opposite Spirits to the way of Truth; and there is no question but Edward Borroughs knew what Spirit of opposition he had to en∣counter with, that by the Light of Christ Jesus he knew what was the portion of that Spirit: But let the Au∣thor of that Book, or any for him, prove if they can, that ever Edward Borroughs did do any wrong either to Man, Woman or Child. And he saith, (speaking of Christ,) he hath strictly injoyned his followers to
be humble and lowly in heart, to esteem others better then themselves, to speak evil of no man, &c. and not to judge, &c. Answer, But all this while this man that doth thus prescribe from what is written, what others should do, he himself doth not so; it appears by concealing of his name, he is not wil∣ling to be known; But sure when he bethinks himself, he cannot suppose that the spirit of Truth doth lead its followers to esteem Hypocrites, and those that oppose the way thereof (a∣bove them that are led and guided by it.) And sure the Author by disesteem∣ing of the Light of Christ, that ligh∣teneth every man that comes into the World, rendering it a natural Light, as he hath done in many places, is be∣come very blind indeed; if he thinks the Spirit of Truth did forbid the judgment of Truth: by these words of Christ Mat. 7. Judge not, that ye be not judged, this he spoke to Hypocrites that went about to pull out a mote out of others eyes, and the beam remained
in their own; saying, Thou Hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy Brothers eye: But such gross darkness hath happened to many that do not believe in the Light, and not knowing the way of the Spirit of Truth; yet for sinister ends in great presumption, undertakes to correct them who are born of the same, and are in measure acquainted with the way thereof; as that dear and faithful Servant of the Lord Edward Burroughs was, as may be seen by his works, which stand a witness against deceitful flattering Tongues: But this is the old way of the enemy and ad∣versary of the peace and happiness of Souls, to cover his hatred and malice with smooth flattery in words: As saith David in another case, Psal. 55.21. The words of his mouth were smoother then Butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer then Oyl, yet were they as drawn Swords. But to speak the Truth, by the lead∣ing and guiding of the Spirit of Truth,
as the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles did; though in very sharp reproofs to gainsayers, is not against true humility, nor a speaking evil of any man. In Page. 11. The Author saith, Nei∣ther you are not guilty of rejecting Gods way and method of converting men to, and keeping them in the way of saving Faith, Repentance and Evangelical obe∣dience; and of inventing and chusing one of your own, &c. Which method he instances out of two Authors, Edward Burroughs's Book, and one of William Pens. The which is as followeth word for word. In the works of Edward Burrough, who you are pleased to stile that true Prophet in the Title page, which are published by you; there are these say∣ings: In page 252, thus, His pure Spirit is put into the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of life in all things: And again, Only by the teaching of the eter∣nal Spirit, is the living God known in the Creature. Again page 408. It is promised (saith he) that the Spirit shall
lead into all Truth, and such do own the Scriptures, but not as their Teacher; for the anointing dwells in them, and they need no man to teach them, but as that anointing teacheth all things; for all the Children of God are taught of God, and need not any other Teacher, nor need to say one to another, know the Lord; and all such own the Scriptures to be the Testi∣mony of that which they believe and have received: And again in page 834. The only perfect rule of Conscience in the ex∣ercise to God is the Spirit of Christ, and not any other thing: And because some∣thing besides the Spirit of God exercises the Conscience; therefore it is that there are so many wayes and Sects of Religion and kinds of Worship in Christendom and among Christians, while the Spirit of Christ only is not the rule of Judgment and exercise of Conscience to God and man: Again page 861. The judgment in that matter (Heresie) must be just, equal, holy, and (only) by the Spirit of Christ which is infallible, and gives in∣fallibility of Judgement and discerning into all cases and things.
Mr. Pen spends the fourth Chapter of his late Book; Intituled, Reason against Railing, to prove that the Light within, and not the Scriptures is the rule of Faith and practice, In page. 47. he saith, We dare boldly affirm in the name of the Lord, that the great reason of our belief concerning them, the Scriptures is not any outward thing; but inward Testi∣mony recorded, and Heavenly Amen, that we have received from the holy Light within us, to the Truth and faithfulness of those sayings. Again p. 48. Where∣fore the Scriptures are so far from being the great rule of faith and practice; that the Light of Christ within us, is both our warrant and rule for faith and obedience to them. Again page 114. Let it be re∣membred, saith he, that Christ promised to send the spirit of Truth to lead into all Truth; as much as to say, none are led into the Truth, nor in the Truth, but by the holy Spirit of Truth; or that their practice is a lye, or they are led into a lye, who are not led by the Spirit of Truth, that alone leads into all the ways of Truth; where by Truth is not meant the meer
Letter of the Scripture, which notwith∣standing is true: But the living power∣ful Truth, Christ the Way, the Truth and the Life; of which the Scripture is but a record or declaration. And page 115. Many may run into the practice of several outward things mentioned in the Scrip∣tures, to have been the practice of Saints in former Ages, and yet not be led into the Truth; for all that is but Will-wor∣ship, imitation and unwarrantable. Now let all the wise in heart, who do retain so much of sense of the Spi∣rit of Truths leading and operation thereof in them, as that thereby they are in some degree in a capacity to judge of spiritual matters, and that have a desire that God may not take away his holy Spirit from them: I say, let all such in the coole of the day, when all self Interest is laid aside, judge whether these men, Edward Burroughs and William Pen, and all them who are of the same Faith and Judgment with them, do deserve such strange contradicton as the Author of that Book hath raised and made against them.
To be sure their method (as he calls it) is clearly agreeing with Christ and his Apostles: Christ Jesus the Light of the World, the Way, Truth and Life, did direct his followers to take heed to the Spirit of Truth that re∣proveth the World of sin, &c. and he counselled them to take that for their guide into all Truth: And ought not all Christians to be followers of Christ their Lord and Master; and how is it possible that any should follow Christ, except they be led by the Spirit of Truth in themselves? And he that steals away their minds from that guide, he is a Thief; and as Christ said, The Thief comes to steal, to Murder and to destroy; but I am come that you may have Life, and that you may have it more abundantly. And the Apostle Paul is very open and plain in his Testimony concerning this matter, in these words, The things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God; by this the deep things of God are searched out: And are there not many deep things of God contained in
Scriptures? The which is not possible to be understood and searcht out by any other Spirit, but only and alone by the Spirit of Truth; therefore this must needs be a sufficient teacher of mankind without the Scripture, as it was to Abel, Enoch, and to Abraham, and the holy men of God long before there was any of the old or new Testament written. And it was the great love of God in the moving of his holy Spirit in those faithful Servants, by whom those weighty things as are recorded in the Scriptures of Truth were given forth: And it is the great love of God in the moving of his holy Spirit in its leadings and teaching of his people, through which the many Types, Figures, Pro∣phesies, and many hard sayings comes to be understood, and a clear distin∣guishing comes to be known between the Jew outward and the Jew inward, between the Law outward and the Law of the Spirit of Truth inward, and be∣tween the shadow of good things, and the good things themselves; and also
between the Spirit and the Letter, the Power and the Form, &c. And for want of fearing God, and taking heed to the motions of his blessed Spirit of Truth; that is the cause there are so many heaps of Opi∣nions about the Scripture; therefore it is that all learned men in the Spirit of Truth do so highly esteem the teachings thereof, as absolutely necessary to life and peace: And all whose minds are converted by the Spirit of Truth, and are spiritually exercised therein, and feeling the life and peace that flows from it unto their Souls; this confirms them, settles them, and makes them un∣moveable and unchangeable in their Faith in the power of the Lord, who hath been thus merciful in opening this fountain of life and love, where a washing and cleansing comes to be wit∣nessed, and entrance ministered into the kingdom of God, and of this day that is breaking forth and shining clearer and clearer: Edward Burroughs that man of God, was a faithful Instru∣ment in the hand of the Lord, and his
works do demonstrate the same to thrash and cut down hypocrisie and gainsayers of the Truth and faithfulness of God unto mankind: And in the suc∣cession of this blessed work and service in the everlasting and unchangeable Truth, the Lord hath raised up William Pen with a Testimony: And in his continuance therein unto the end of his days he will receive the same Crown of Immortal Life; and their Testi∣monies which the Author calls their method taken out of their Books is faithful and true, and doth and will ap∣pear so to all that are in the least lear∣ned by the Spirit of Truth. But in contradiction of those faith∣ful and true Testimonies of Edward Burrough's and William Pen's, the Au∣thor of that Book undertakes to pre∣scribe a method and way, the which he calls Gods method and way; this be∣ing a long ramble too tedious to tran∣scribe, I shall draw up the scope and tendency thereof. That (Page 15.) after Christs ascensi∣on into Heaven, he sent the holy Spirit
upon his Apostles, and immediatly in∣spired them with a clear knowledge and understanding of it (And again page 24.) Although the first promulgator of the Go∣spel were enabled by immediate Revelation from Christ to teach it unto others; yet afterward Gods ordinary way and method of transmitting the knowledge and faith of the Gospel downwards to others suc∣cessively, was by such mens teaching it to others, as had themselves learned it of the Apostles, or others that taught the same Doctrine as they did. (Again page 28.) And there is great reason why the same re∣gard should be given to what the Apo∣stles and Evangelists wrote, as to what they spoke; as long as they either wrote the same Doctrine, or History upon the same evidence; for the Doctrine is the same after it is written as it was be∣fore, for its being written doth not alter the nature of it: And therefore men must needs be as much concerned in their belief, or disbelief, obedience or disobedience to it, when it is communicated to them by writing, as when it is so by preaching; (yea I had almost said, or by immediate
Revelation.) (And again page 33.) I shall conclude what I have said in this proposition, to shew that the same regard is due to the Doctrine of the Apostles, when written, (as now it is) as when it was preached by them, by remembring you of this great Truth, that every man shall be tryed or judged at the last day, by the Law he hath been under. The Gentiles that are or have been without a written Law, shall be judged without any such Law, and the Jews which are under a written Law, they shall be judged by it, Rom. 2.12. Even so those that are un∣der the Gospel written will be judged by that, &c. Thus then I take the substance of his method to be, that the Apostles were immediatly Inspired and from im∣mediate Revelation; the New Testa∣ment was written, and since that imme∣mediate Revelation and Inspiration of the Spirit hath ceased; and those writings now are become the rule of faith and practice: And that this Go∣spel written, as he calls it, hath been suc∣cessively transmitted to others as they
have learnt it; and that this written Gospel (as he calls it) must be the rule and judge in all matters of faith and practice, without immediate Teach∣ing or Inspiration. This then being the method of the Author of that Book, to exclude im∣mediate Revelation, and set up Tradi∣tion in the room. But this he hath manifested by his writing, that he is not in the line of succession in the holy Spirit of Truth and righteousness; if he had been there, he would never have opposed the Truth of what was spoken by William Pen and Edward Burroughs: But who can expect any better fruit from a Plant that hath so little sap and life from the root, and spring of Light, Truth and Holiness to nou∣rish it. Page 41. (he saith,) That Christ doth inlighten all whom he doth inlighten in one or more of these three wayes. 1. Either by Natural Light. Or 2. by Superna∣tural Revelation. Or 3. by outward speech, or writing, or example, &c.
Would not all that are in their wits judge that this Author of the Book had better to have been quiet then so pre∣sumptuously in his high flown, proud, arrogant Spirit: So positively to con∣demn the sufficiency of the Lights lead∣ing within into Christianity; with∣out outward Teaching: Since he is at such a loss, not knowing what Light it is that Christ doth inlighten people with. But in page 43. there he saith, That though Christ do inlighten all men with natural light; a little before it is, them whom he doth inlighten; it is some way, even what he imagines, wherein he contradicts himself; but what way he knows not: The Vulture's eye hath not seen the way thereof, neither can the natural man receive the things of the Spirit of God: To be sure the Au∣thor of that Book hath not attained to A.B.C. in the way of Christianity, as is manifest by his dark conclusion, that Christ the Light within men, is a natu∣ral Light. Let all the wise in heart judge how unlikely the Author of that Book is
to shew the way of God, who is so far out of it; not knowing the out∣goings of the Lord God who is Light, whose outgoings were from everlasting to everlasting, nor so much as the first principle of the Oracle of God, which is Light; and therefore he hath not spoken as the Oracle of God: And therefore in saying he would shew the method and way of God, he hath ma∣nifestly declared his Ignorance and pre∣sumption: But such unlearned men as he is undertake to judge the Quakers foundation for error; and after they have done, they are to seek what it is: But let him or any who are of his mind prove if they can, that ever any Qua∣kers in their Writings have said, That it was by the leading of a natural Light without, or with outward Teaching, by which ever any one true Christian was made. No, no, we do know that Christ the true Light that Lighteneth man that comes into the World, doth it with a supernatural and Divine Light (wherein they that believe and wait upon God, receive Spirit, Life and
Power to become Sons of God.) And that he both hath and can by the power∣ful drawings thereof, bring them (who wait in the manifestation thereof in themselves) into the true Christianity: And that the outward Testimony or de∣claration that was, or is given forth unto the Sons and Daughters of men from the immediate motion and flow∣ings forth of the Spirit of Truth; had and hath this effect, even to bring into this name, the Light of Christ within, and from Satans power unto God, that the teaching of God within, as well as without, by them who speak as his Oracle, might be effectual to guide into Christianity: And that the powerful drawings of the blessed Light of Christ within, hath been the only motive to move many to consider their ways and to turn at the reproofs thereof into the straight and narrow way that leads in∣to the life of Christianity. But I do ask a question concerning the Gentiles, that both were and are without an outward written Law, since they must be judged without any
such Law; for transgressing of what Law must they be judged? it cannot be denyed but that God hath given them a Law to walk by, and that it is for the transgression thereof that they come under condemnation, and must be judged. Before this question be answered in Truth, that Gospel must be known that is preached in every creature which is under Heaven. Page 37. The Author saith, we that have the Doctrine of Christ and his A∣postles brought down to us in the Scrip∣tures, may according to Scripture Dia∣lect, be said to have Christ and his Apo∣stles; as truly as it was said of the Jews in our Saviours days on Earth, that they had Moses and the Prophets; for it was by having in the Scriptures what they said and did, that they were said to have them; and by hearing and believing the Scriptures of the New Testament, we may as well be said to hear and believe Christ and his Apostles, &c. Answer, That ever such a stranger to Christianity should be so impudent as to say, I will shew you the method and
way of God, that doth not know him∣self one step therein, as appears by his dark arguing. The Jews had the wri∣ting of Moses and the Prophets, and no question but they did believe them to be so; but what did they profit by them? when out of that Faith and Spirit through which they are profi∣table, they did testifie of Christ, and were a witness to the righteousness of God, as saith the Apostle; when by them they judged Christ ought to die, Christ did send the hard-hearted Jews who went about to kill him, to Moses and the Prophets; saying, Joh. 5.39, 40. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which testifie of me; and ye will not come to me that ye may have life: And mind what the Apostle saith, Rom. 3.12. But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; which righteousness the said Jews did not know, though they had heard what Moses and the Prophets said of it: But mind the cause of their not hearing so
as to understand, Neh. 9.20. Thougavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, but the cause of their blindness was even their rebellion against Gods Spirit: And Stephen said to the Jews Acts 7.51: Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your Fathers did, so do ye: So it's very clear, though the Jews had Moses and the Prophets writings, yet by not taking heed to the Instruction of Gods Spirit in them, they were with∣out the knowledge of them; and thus it is with the generality of those called Christians, they have some of the wri∣things which gives a relation of Gods great love to the World in his heavenly and powerful gift of his holy Spirit ma∣nifest in the flesh to bruise the Serpents head, and to destroy the Devils works: But by disesteeming the blessed ap∣pearance of the Light of the Spirit of Christ in man, as the Author of that Book doth in calling it a natural Light; being thus in unblief, their foolish hearts are darkned: So though they have the New Testament, as it is called
by many that do not know the Law and the Testimony, though they have some part of what was writ concerning Christ the Way, Truth and Life of Christianity: Yet by their quenching and grieving the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit in them, they are as clearly void of the knowledge of the end and tendency of Gods great love in and by the motion of his holy Spirit, that gave forth those writings with the several blessed Testimonies therein, even as the hard-hearted Jews were of the Law and the Prophets when they were in the gainsaying and rebellion against Gods holy Spirit. But such kind of smooth teaching, as the Au∣thor of that Book, who is unlearned in the blessed Teaching of the Spirit of Truth, is very pleasant to unlearned people in the things of God; but the Scripture is fulfilled in many of them, Acts 13.41. Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish, for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it un∣to you.
So it's very clear, and that in a true sense, that people may have the writings and not have Christ nor his Apostles, neither be in their Doctrine; but in lieu thereof they may have the Spirit of Antichrist, and Doctrine of Antichrist, and the ravening Woolves nature, though they may have the Sheeps clothing. First, The Scriptures we must needs highly own, in that they refer us to (and exalt) Christ and his immediate teaching of his Divine Light and Spi∣rit within, as being subservient thereto, where they are received therein. But since a great part of the work of the Author of that Book is to main∣tain the Scriptures, being a rule of Faith and Practice; and to gainsay the sufficiency of the Spirits teaching with∣out the Scriptures, or its immediate teaching now adays, without some out∣ward teaching. I do ask whether the Authority be in the Spirit that spoke the words, or in the words when spoken or written? if none can deny but the Authority
both was and is in the Spirit: And Isaiah by the same Authority of Gods blessed Spirit, he can work a saving change in people, either with or with∣out what is written; therefore it is a high degree of presumption in going about to limit the blessed holy Spirit of God, as the Author of that Book doth. But what Authority or effect had the true Prophets words in the false Pro∣phets mouths; this sad effect, they stole away the hearts of people from the living fountain, and put them upon a vain labour in making broken Cisterns that could hold no water. And what Authority, profit or ad∣vantage have the true Ministers and Apostles of Christs words now in the false Teachers mouths, with their mean∣ing upon them: Even this sad and la∣mentable effect; they thereby steal a∣way the hearts of people from the sense of the immediate motion of Gods holy Spirit in them, and to gainsay its power∣ful teachings; and the universal love of God in the moving of his universal
holy Spirit through all the World, in its convincing and reproving the World of sin, &c. And then to set them upon vain and unprofitable service: First, having turned their hearts and minds out of the way that the holy Spirit of Truth leads in, and then set them upon a vain labour and travail in seeking, but never finding; till at length they conclude with the Devils Doctrine, that there is no way out of a body of sin and death on this side the grave: And such flattering and deceitful Teachers are in a high esteem and account among a flattering deceitful people. So all may mind, that we do not oppose the in ward Teaching of the Spirit of Truth, to what outwardly hath been taught or written from the blessed motions there∣of, or that may be taught or written by the motion of the same: But we do oppose the true Teachings thereof, to the false Teaching of all immaginary de∣ceitful Spirits, who under a pretence of love to Souls, do make Merchandize of them.
And that being the great hinge on which his work depends, in con∣cluding the Scriptures to be the rule of Faith and Practice, excluding the immediate Teaching of the Spirit, and the all-sufficiency thereof. I do ask whether Faith be a fruit of the Spirit, or of the Scripture? or whether a true Christians practice in living peaceably, lovingly, justly, and holy, and merci∣fully, and in a clean life and conversa∣tion in long sufference, patience, good∣ness, brotherly kindness, &c. be a fruit of the blessed Spirit of God, or of the Scripture? And since it cannot be denyed, but that Faith and practice in a true Christian holy Conversation, is a fruit of the blessed Spirit, and that the Scriptures say the same. Then are not all the gain-sayers of the immediate Teaching, Opperation, Revelation and Divine Inspiration of Gods holy Spirit of Truth, a grand cause that there is so little fruit of the Spirit brought forth in Christendom? And whether that be not the cause of so many heaps of Sects, Notionists and
Opinions among them, and of so much Pride, Lust, Hypocrisie, Fraud, Deceit, Wrath, Malice, Murders, Witchcrafts, Sorceries, and all other abominations that might be mentioned, committed in all the World; (the Lord gives the humble in heart true Judgment, but the proud he doth resist.) But in Page 42. the Author saith, Christ indeed or God Creator, as he is described in the beginning of that Chap. Joh. 1.9. Doth enlighten every one that cometh into the World, with the faculty of reason and understanding, by which he may know that there is a God, and that he is to be worshipped, and that he is peaceable, and the difference between moral good and evil, in many things: But however this may possibly be a light sufficient to direct the Heathen to as much as God expects from them, (if they live up to it) to whom he affords no other Light, yet this Natural Light is not sufficient to direct those that live under the Gospel, to believe, and do what they are bound to believe, and do upon pain of Damna∣tion, &c.
Answer, He hath clearly manifested his ignorance of the Gospel, and what men are to be brought under that are made true Christians, as if the Light of Christ within had not Gospel in it, or could not minister Gospel: But by hating of the Light; how blind are they, who have such low thoughts of thy way thereof? accounting the Light of Christ natural, yet sufficient to di∣rect the Heathen as much as God ex∣pects of them. Such is the esteem of them whom the God of this world hath blinded their minds, taking the Jew outward for the Jew inward, and the Christian in shew, for the Christian in Truth: And the wild Heathenish life and con∣versation of the Christian in shew, for Christianity, if they do but only in words own the Scriptures to be their rule of faith and practice. And the true Christian that brings forth the fruits of Gods holy Spirit in life and conversation, and is not ashamed to confess to the immediate motions of it in its blessed leadings and teaching to
love of God above all, and their neigh∣bours as themselves; and lives in true fear and watchfulness, that they may not grieve nor quench the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit in them; but are careful to live up to the reason and understanding that Christ hath illu∣minated or inspired them with, and to eshew the evil and to love the good, being shewed it by the Light of Christ; and that God ought to be worshiped in Spirit and Truth, and is in the perfor∣mance thereof according to Gods will, confessing to the blessed holy Spirit of God to be the rule of Life, Faith practice. Such a faithful and true Chri∣stian as this, having such an account to give, as is given by Edward Bur∣rough and William Pen of the sufficiency of the pure Spirit of God, to be the Judge of all matters of life and con∣versation. Such true Christians are very slight∣ly esteemed by such private immaginary Spirits as the Author of that Book is manifest to be of in all his works of darkness in that Book. But I had ra∣ther
be a Christian, and though I am called Heathen; then to be a Hea∣then, and yet to be called and accoun∣ted a Christian. In Page 61. the Author saith, Ano∣ther place misunderstood and misapplyed by you, is Joh. 16.13. When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; which is not a promise of sending the Spirit to guide all Chri∣stians by its immediate motions: But a promise to his Apostles, for they only were then present with Christ at his passover, &c. Ans. Indeed the immediate moti∣ons of Gods holy Spirit, is the great trouble of them who follow the moti∣ons of their own Spirit, and lives out of the way of the knowledge of the ho∣ly Spirit of God, which is Light and Life. But I ask, in case people are not to follow Christ and his Apostles into the true Faith and practice of Chri∣stianity, by the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit of Truth; by the motions of what Spirit are they to be led and guided? since there is such va∣riety
of Sects and Opinions in the mo∣tions of their private Spirits, which of them is to be followed. But since the Author hath limited the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit only unto the Apostles: I do ask into what Spirits motions were people Baptized, and led into the body of Christianity? or are they now to be led into the same; and how can Chri∣stians have the Crown of Immortal Life as Paul had in finishing his course of life well, and he said, that was not laid up for him alone, but also for all them that love the appearance of our Lord Je∣sus Christ: And who can be a follower of him in the way, if they do not take heed to the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit, as he did according to the measure and manifestation thereof in every one? And again, What can set people free from the spirit of bondage, or from the spirit of error or corruption, and deceit, and hypocrisie; but the immediate moti∣ons of Gods pure holy spirit in them?
But such is the dark work of the Author of that Book, even to gain∣say, and limit the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit, and to set up the private selfish imaginary Spirit which is not in unity with the Light and Spi∣rit of Truth. But if the promise of Christ was only to give that gift of the immediate mo∣tion of Gods holy Spirit unto the Apo∣stles; then to what end did he counsel the Churches to Pray in the Spirit, to Sing in the Spirit, and to persevere and go on in the Spirit, and not to quench and grieve the Spirit, and abun∣dance more to this purpose in Exhor∣tations to the Churches to follow the spirit, and mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit: Had not Christians need to have the immediate motions and help of Gods blessed spirit in this work, and to be their rule of life and guide in judgment, that all wicked malitious spirits under the cover of the Prophets, Christs and the Apostles words, may be judged down, let all the wise in heart consider this and lay it to heart.
What a sad tendency such unprofi∣table talkers and teaching hath, in op∣posing the immediate motion, and teaching, and guiding of Gods holy spirit; and whether such Agents and props in the Divels kingdom and power of darkness, be not a lett to the blessed works of the Lord? who sits upon his Throne, and saith, behold I make all things new. And whether such dark works as are manifest in that Book, be not the cause that there are so many mockers now adays at the im∣mediate motions of Gods holy spirit, in and through his servants, according to their several measures and services therein? But such is the work of all dark spirits, to pretend love to peoples souls: But in the dark to work against the great love and mercy of God in the immediate motions of his holy and blessed spirit, for the bringing of souls to peace and happiness, and everlasting rest in his heavenly gift, the which is life Eternal. But by what hath been written, as before, the whole drift, scope and ten∣dency
of the Authors spirit in that Book may be seen, where several par∣ticulars might be answered with the same sharp reproof, as that which is answered hath: Such works have been answered over and over again, as may be seen at large in abundance of Books; but one more especially I refer the Reader to: And that is a Book Intitled, The Christian Quaker and his Divine Testimony vindicated, &c. By George Whitehead and William Pen: And though the Author of that Book hath concealed his Name, and covered his spirit of Error with smooth words stolen out of the Scriptures, yet by the light of Christ Jesus he is seen clearly, though he calls that Light Natural, and like a foolish builder hath built without the Corner-stone: By the Light of Christ his building is seen to be raised from no other foundation and ground, but meer imaginations: And that it must be cast down into the pit of dark∣ness out of which it was raised. So though he may complain, as he doth in the beginning of his Book,
of the entertainment others have had in the like endeavours: Yet unto the Truth and wisdom of God in all who have not lost the sense of his holy spi∣rit from them, I do appeal whether this be not an entertainment according to Truth. And though he hath pretended his work to be in love to souls; yet it is manifest in the Light of Christ, to have this tendency; even to deprive souls of the infinite benefit of the sense and injoyment of the immediate motions of Gods holy spirit, and to make void their Testimonies who are planted into the same: But to prevent the Enemies works, is this written in love to Truth and Righteousness, and all people who desire after the same. Stephen Smith. Worplesdon in Surrey the latter end of the 5th. Month, 1677.
A Testimony against the Worlds vain Mirth and Pastimes, &c. BLessed are they who feel the In∣spiration of the Almighty giving them understanding; that in reading the Scriptures of Truth (the Holy-mens Testimonies) they may be understood, and deliverance witnessed from them who wrest them to their own destruction. There is indeed a time for all things, as said Solomon, who in that wisdom given him, knew that God created man upright, but man found out many Inventions: And all that Mirth where∣by Gods righteous spirit is grieved, they who live in it; they increase their own sorrow.
The Rejoycing and Melody which David had in his heart to the Lord who gave him power over his foes, Psal. 30. And girded him with gladness: But what is this to them who are over∣come with their foes, the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh and pride of life: All such have not a true know∣ledge of that joy and melody which David witnessed, as being girded with gladness by the Lord; who said, My soul and all that is in me praise the Lord, and let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord: And figuratively he makes mention of outward Instruments; all which are but Types in comparison of that heart that is prepared and put into a right frame, even as a well Tuned Instrument to make Melody to the praise and honour of God (this is the sub∣stance) shewed forth by holy peoples praises to the Lord for his work of deli∣verance; as is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth: When the Children of Israel were delivered, and their foes destroy∣ed: Then sang Moses and the Chil∣dren of Israel: (and this was the sub∣stance,
the Lord shall reign for ever and ever:) And Miriam with the women went out with Timbrels and Dances in a Heavenly Melody unto the Lord who had delivered them. But the wicked and proud who hate to be reformed, they have no∣thing to do to take the name of the Lord in their mouths: And none but wicked Instruments dare bring those Scriptures to stir youth up to be Pro∣digals, and to spend their Portion of precious time in riotous living in keep∣ing company with some who wallow in pride and idleness Sodoms sins; and except such Prodigals do turn whilst the door of mercy doth open, and they find a reception into the Fathers house, by a true unfeigned repentance; they shall never witness that Melody or Musick (whereby the Soul is made to leap for joy,) which the Prodigal obtained through a true repentance, and returned to his Fathers house; he had not that Musick and Melody among the Harlots, nor when he kept Swine; mind that, see the generation of the
wicked, Job. 21.11. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their Children Dance: They take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce in the sound of the Organ: They spend their dayes in Wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave: Therefore they say unto God, de∣part from us, we desire not the know∣ledge of thy wayes: What is the Almigh∣ty that we should serve him, &c. See here you wicked generation of proud prophane persons, who stir up the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life one in another, by your light frothy behaviours in your wicked Inventions. Oh for shame do not go about to cover your evil works by the instigation of wicked Instru∣ments, who wrest the holy mens words; which if persisted in, will be to their de∣structions, and of all them that follow them therein. See what the Prophet Amos pronounced to them that chant to the Viol, &c. And are at ease, wo to them, Amos 6. And concerning comparisons in the sound of Instruments, being certain or
uncertain; this makes not at all for your purpose who extol that Musick by which the Lord is dishonoured, and the seed of life grieved and burdened, so for shame leave off your lightness and vanity, least you be left as them who are filthy to be filthy still, and you seek repentance, as Esau did with tears, and cannot find acceptance. And see the effects of wicked Dan∣cing, Mat. 14.6, 7. But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the Daughter of Herodias danced before them: Now read and see what effects her brave Dancing procured; weigh these things you that have Children that are Light and Airy, and restrain them from that wicked practice, least they add sin un∣to sin, and bring woe upon them, as you may see Herodias Daughter, who added one wickedness unto another. Stephen Smith.
To all Bishops and Priests, and all concerned with them in a Book Intituled, A form of Common Prayer, for Gods blessing up∣on His Majesty and His Do∣minions, and for the averting Gods Judgments, Printed this year 1678. ANswer, The Lord God hath sig∣nally shewen his great displea∣sure by Sword, by Plague, and by Fire, against that opposite spirit that hath led into all rebellion against the motions of his holy spirit, where∣in he is making known his way of blessing, and his saving health among the people. Yet for his great name sake, and in his love, mercy and pity, he did put a stop to those Judge∣ments, and hath given space and time
of repentance; and through many faithful Servants hath the Lord mani∣fested his good pleasure, that all who are erred from the way of blessing in life and peace, that they might return unto him and wait upon him who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, for his teachings and instructions in his holy Covenant of Life and Peace: But how regardless have you been of the many and frequent Testimonies that have been faithfully in the moving of Gods holy spirit of Truth, given forth against the swelling and groaning abominati∣ons of the times? So that instead of hearkning and obeying the motions of Gods holy spirit, you have proceeded in vexing and grieving the same in a most high degree; you have abused the Servants of the Lord God: And through your pride and presumption you have drawn the heavy displeasure of the Lord upon you, whose dreadful judgments do hang over you; and will not be averted or turned from you by any feigned shew of fasting made up in the will of man, contrary to the good will, mind and pleasure of God.
In that which is called the order for Morning Prayer, are these words; Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, &c. Answer, To them that do in Truth and in unfeigned repentance open their hearts unto him, with a faithful resigna∣tion of heart, soul and body unto the pure manifestation of his holy Law of his pure spirit of life; unto such he hath shewn himself very gracious and mer∣ciful, in setting them free from the Law of sin and death: But how often do you repeat those words, and yet keep your hearts whole in the friendship of the World, in the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and pride of life; you have been so far from renting your hearts, that you have not so much as rent your garments; are not the gar∣ments of your own righteousness (which is no better then filthy rags) whole up∣on you; and in that loathsom garment you appearing before the Lord, who seeing your loathsomness and hypo∣crisie in imputing the righteousness of
Christ unto you, whilst you are really and truly whole in your loathsome gar∣ments of your own righteousness; where the righteous judge both of the quick and the dead, beholding you as you are in your loathsome garments, he will never agree with you in your accounts, whilst you account so falsly of your Interest in the righteousness of Christ, and yet whole in the garments of sin and iniquity, doing the things you should not do, and leaving un∣done the things you should do; would you when you reckon with your Ser∣vants agree with them in such account, and allow of their doing so all their life, and leave them to account of your riches; and that you are bound to give it them; sure its time to be awake∣ned from this misery of ignorance: And take notice of your following words, Though we have rebelled against him, neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his Laws which he set before us. (Now mind) was ever your hearts rent from this condi∣tion; do not you persist in your re∣bellion
and so grieve Gods holy spirit, in keeping your heart whole, in persecuting them who are led by it: Are not the Priests whole in their sin of preaching for Hire and for filthy lucre sake, they tell lyes in Hypocrisie, pro∣mising that to people, which neither they nor the people have right unto, whilst they are Servants to sin: Come down from these barren mountains of imaginations, and rent off these filthy garments, and rent your hearts from these evils, and follow the example of them who are really in this work, and from the Lords acceptance have found him gracious and merciful, and in the righteous government of his holy spirit of Truth, the knowledge of his way of Truth is known in this World, and in walking therein there is that hope ma∣nifest by Christs righteousness in us, of having Eternal life with him in that World which is without end. And you say, Dearly beloved Bre∣thren, the Scripture moveth us in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that
we should not dissemble and cloak them before the face of Almighty God our hea∣venly Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent and obedient heart, &c. Answer, Here you acknowledge yourselves to be fallen from the Primi∣tive Christians guide, and moreover, in the service and work of the Lord they did speak as they were moved by Gods holy spirit, and did declare the pleasure and will of God as that gave utterance; and by his holy spirit they were made Ministers, not coveting any mans Silver or Gold, or Apparel, nor they did not move for any filthy lucre sake; but how have you erred and strayed from this way, being lost as to a true and saving knowledge of the motions of Gods holy spirit: And in this lost Estate every private spirit is set a work, and imaginations dreams do tell their several conceivings of what was given forth by the moving of Gods holy spirit; but having erred from the way of the spirit of God, and being strangers thereunto, they are also
strangers to what was given forth by the Spi∣rit of God; thus being in error, they don't know the Scriptures nor the power of God: And thus being become strangers to the moti∣on of the true Christian Spirit, in the Worlds earthly sensual Spirit they move, and say, the Scripture moveth, and under this cover you can dissemble and cloak your sins, cloaking your selves under the failings of the holy men of God, as they are recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, but are far enough off their sorrow and repentance by which they obtained favour with God again; And thus you go on cloak∣ing your sins, and opposing the motions of Gods holy Spirit, under a pretence of the Scrip∣ture moveth us; and under this cover you can dissemble your sins in persecuting and spoiling the Goods of them who have truly testified of the motions of Gods holy Spirit in them, against all the evil motions of the ene∣my in all his flattering deceitful works and wayes: And to this motion of Gods holy Spirit you must bow if ever you come to know the way of Truth, you must come to the mo∣ving of the Spirit of Truth in you, even that Spirit which reproves the World of sin, the which Christ Jesus set up to be a leader and a guide into all Truth: In this Spirit the Lord God is to be worshipped, it's this Spirit that convinceth of sin, that is the way out of sin, that is it which moves in the heart against sin,
and so to confess and acknowledge sin, and so to repent and forsake sin, and this is the way to obtain mercy and forgiveness of sin. And by its leading and guiding to abstain from the appearance of evil, unto this Spirit of Truth you must bow, and take it for your leader, if ever you come truly to call God Father, and he owns you to be his Sons. In your Confession you say, Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from thy wayes like lost sheep; we have followed too wuch the devices and desires of our own hearts, we have offended against thy holy Laws, we have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and there is no health in us, &c. Answer, And when do you intend to do otherwise, since you have appointed this form of words to be always said. Oh turn for shame unto the true Spepherd and Bishop of your Soul; and don't come still with this sad un∣profitable story before the Lord. (Mind) if a man offend against the Laws of the Nation, if it be but once he is lyable to the punishment that is prescribed by that Law, or if a Servant should but once do the thing he should not do, and leave undone the things he should do, this would incurr his Masters displeasure; but if he should continue doing so, he would turn him out of his service and account of him as he is an unprofitable Servant: How then can you ex∣pect to be heard and received of the Lord, who
are alwayes doing that you should not do, and leaving undone that you should do; you may well say you have no health in you, neither are you like to have, so long as you continue in these sad practices: And in that you do offend Gods righteous Law, how can you ex∣pect but to be punished by the righteous Judge? Indeed you have done that which you ought not to have done, in that you have caused to suffer so many innocent people, both by long Imprisonment, and spoiling of their Goods; in that you have shewn no more mercy to them, how can you expect to receive mercy at the hand of God, seeing those sufferers have been a people fearing God, and hoping for his mercy in whom the Lord takes pleasure, and in his pleasure he hath sustained them, wherein many have been faithful and true witnesses, where∣of many have departed this World under their several confinements in peace; and many re∣mains living to this day confessing and testi∣fying to the mercies and favour of God in the manifestation of the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, which sets free them who walk up to it from the Law of sin and death: And that there is great peace in keeping this holy Law, this hath been, and is the Testimony of them who are, and have been led by the Spirit of Truth, witnessing unto the Way, Truth and Life, the way of peace and happiness: And thus in the good will of God in good
will to all mankind, in patient suffering under your wills who have followed too much the devices and desires of your own hearts, and thereby having rejected the councel of the Spirit of Truth, you have provoked the Lord, as you say in these words: We have pro∣voked thine anger, thy wrath is waxed hot, and thy heavy displeasure is sore kindled against us. You have confessed to the Truth, and when you come to feel the weight of your many transgressions against Gods holy Law, then you will wish you had been serious in what you have said, and that you had broken off your sins by a true and unfeigned repentance: And for this end hath Gods holy Spirit strove with you many wayes; but see by your own con∣fession how evilly you have required this love. Your words are, We sinful people of this land do acknowledge before thee, to thy glory and our own shame and confusion, that never any Nation under Heaven had more experience of all the in∣stances of thy goodness, and the methods of our amendment; nor yet did ever any more shamful∣ly abuse them, when thou gavest us great and long prosperities, we sed our selves to the full, waxed fat and wanton, and kicked against thee; when thou threwest us into horrid confusions, from which we saw then little hope of arising, even in the time of that distress did we trespass yet more against thee, when by miracles of mercy thou hadst turned our captivities, we soon returned
to folly, to our vomit, and to our wallowing in our former or greater filthiness, &c. Answer, This is a very sad miserable condi∣tion indeed, much to be lamented; you had need consider it and be in Truth humbled for it; and to forsake that evil Spirit that hath been your leader in those horrid practices, and to wait upon the Lord for the leading and guiding of you out of those evils, that you may have a better account to give unto the Lord in the day of account, as Hezekiah had when the Prophet Isaiah was sent unto him with this Message from the Lord: Saying, Thus saith the Lord, set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live; then Hezekiah tur∣ned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the Lord; and said, remember now O Lord I be∣seech thee, how I have walked before in Truth, and with a perfect heart; and have done that which is good in thy sight, and Hezekiah wept sore. And the Lord heard his prayers, and see∣ing his tears, he was very gratious and mer∣ciful unto him, as you may read: Now com∣pare his confession with your confession; and seeing you have no better account to give, you may well be ashamed and confounded at the thoughts of what acceptance you can think to have, and reward at the hand of the Lord. And you say these words, The Communion Service, the Priest standing at the Lords Table shall say: Our Father, &c.
Answer, Here you manifest your selves as deep in the appostasie from the Communion and the  Table, as they were in, who put Lig  Darkness, (and Darkness for Light:) You here plainly shew from whence you had your Ordination and Learning; the least in the School of Christ that hath learned of him, neither Shepherds or Fishermen, sees over the dark works. It's but in vain for you to think to make this service pass; no, that Dark∣ness is much vanquished by the the breaking forth of the Light of Christ out of Darkness, by which the Table of God, and the Table of Devils is known, and the Cup of God, and the Cup of the Devil, and at the Table of God, and with the Cup of God, many thirsting Souls are satisfied, and do truly bless and praise the Lord, knowing that we cannot partake of the Table of God, and the Table of Devils, or of the Cup of God and of the Cup of De∣vils; and therefore are fully satisfied at the Table of God and with the blessing; and here∣in do bless the Lord who hath led many from the North, South, East and West by his good Spirit hereunto: And thus being led by his holy Spirit, we can truly say, our Father who doth feed us in all our tryals and afflictions with his bread of Life, and nourish us with his Cup of Blessing; to him be praise and honour for ever. Oh Nation of England, how wonderful
kind hath the Lord been unto thee, in send∣ing his Servants with warning after warning, even warning thee to break off thy sins by a true repentance? And in that Fast that is ac∣ceptable unto him, that thee mightest have been found in turning from the evil of thy do∣ings, and in answering the Lords just requi∣rings, in doing justly, and walking humbly, and shewing mercy in remembring the meek, and them who fear the Lord, in whom the Lord takes pleasure, and in renting of your false coverings, and have put off your loath∣fome clothing, the which you confess you are under, and to have rent your hearts in deed and in truth, and to have abstained from the appearance of Evil, and to have let the op∣pressed go free: Had you chosen this Fast, and truly turned to the Lord, and in simplicity to have waited upon him, to have known his mind and pleasure in his sore and grievous and never to be forgotten Judgments, with which he did visit you, by Sword, by Plague, and by Fire: (Oh how can you easily pass over the remembrance thereof.) If I say you had considered your ways, and by abstaining from the appearances of evil, you had truly turned unto the Lord; you might then have expected to have found favour of him, and in his coun∣sel and wisdom you might have been directed to have been establisht in the fear of the Lord, and in his righteous way to have been con∣firmed;
and under the covering of the work of his righteous Spirit you might have been preserved, as you pray in these words; From all evil and mischief, from sin, from the crafts and assaults of the Devil, and from thy wrath, and from everlasting damnation, good Lord de∣liver us. But turn unto your confession, and take a view of it, and see how short you have come of this Fast, the which is well pleasing unto the Lord; and how instead of waiting upon the Lord to know his way made known in the Earth, you have gone on in your way of grieving and vexing his good Spirit, and pro∣voking the Lord God against you. But what will be the end thereof? Stephen Smith. The 4th. day of the 3d. Month, 1678. THE END.
