A Letter sent from the Island of Guern∣zey, to a Person of quality in London, concerning the late Irre∣gular Transactions there, &c. SIR, SInce my arrival in this Island, I could not, till this present time, have an opportunity to answer your desires and ex∣pectations in reference to the transactions of Affairs here, which now I have effected by way of some small Vessels, which will be ready within few hours to set sayl for England; by whom I would not omitt the opportunity to give you a short Nar∣rative thereof, which is briefly, as followeth. Assoon as the well-affected and honest People of this Isle had notice that a Parliament was called, they resolved to use what diligence they could, that the Assembly called Estates of this Islle might be summoned to meet in Order, to make choyce of honest and faithful Deputyes to go for Eng∣land to the said Parliament, there to represent the several grievances of the People, and endeavour to obtain redresse therein; as like∣wise the Confirmation, Corroboration, and Augmentation of their antient Charters and Priviledges. But the People were circum∣vented by the surreptitious practices of their present pretended Bay∣liff or Judge, Mr. Peter de Beauvoirs aliàs de Granges, who could not but expect that his fall would be near at hand, unlesse he could hin∣der and prevent the good and honest intentions of the People, from taking effect in their intended choyce of Deputies; especially know∣ing what a firebrand he had been amongst them for diverse years
past, and what fuel of discord and divisions he had kindled amongst them, and how, during the famous long-Parliament in the year 1649. he was for the same, and for several misdemeanors and mal∣versations in the Execution of the said place of Bayliff or Judge there, complained against by several Articles exhibited; whereup∣on the said Parliament in the said year, appointed (by a certain Act) several Comers to go to the said Isle to examine the Complaints and grievances of the People: Two of which Comers (viz. Moses Wall and Roger Frith Gen.) being returned, made their Repot of the State and Condition of Affaires there, which report together with the said Articles of Charge being (upon the 3d of November 1650. by order of the then Council of State) heard and considered by a select Committee appointed by them for that purpose, before whom the said Bayliff appeared, and was heard what he could say or produce in his own defence; after which, the said Committee made their report to the Council, certifying that after a full hearing of the whole business of Guernzey they found the said Bayliff to be a person not fit to execute the said Office and Place, and that for the better Government and future peace of the said Isle, the said Mr. Peter de Beauvoir should be no more Bayliff, and that a new one should be chosen in his room, to be continued onely for three years at the most; which Report was the same day confirmed by the Council, who ordered Cornelius Holland Esq to present it to the Parliament: But the many other weighty affaires of the Common-wealth hindred the said Report from being presented to the said Parliament before their interruption; nothing being done therein till the 29th of August 1653. that then it was ordered by the little Parliament, that the Jurates of Guernzey should execute the said place and office of Bailiff of that Island by turns, each of them a Moneth; which order was very well resented by the People, and very much to their satisfaction, peace, and tranquillity; it having been observed, that during above two years time that the said Order was executed, all former fuell of discord and divisions in that Island wre quenched, during which time, the said Bailiff was obser∣ved to set all his Engines at work, by vilifying the way practised by vertue of the said Order, leaving no way unassaied to watch his op∣portunity to overthrow the same, and bring the old form again; which afterwards he easily effected, making use of the change of Go∣vernment,
came to England, and surreptitiously represented to the late Protector, how that the said Order and Monethly way of offici∣ating the said place of Bailiff in that Isle was not consistent with his Government: and thereupon he plaid his game so cunningly, by in∣direct and surreptitious practises, as by bribing of Clerks with very considerable sums of mony, and also by his Hypocritical carriage, as if he had been a very pious and religious man, when as he was then, and is still known to be a very great Persecutor of God's Peo∣ple, having banished severall godly Ministers, and others, out of the said Isle, for onely differing in Judgment from him; and likewise a very covetous, ambitious, envious, factious, and turbulent person, who was, by the long Parliament, to have been outed for the same: Notwithstanding all which, he, the said Peter de Beauvoir, got the said Order of Parliament to be vacated, and obtained of the said late Protector, a Patent under the great Seal, to have and execute the said Office and place of Bailiff during his life, to the great grief and dis∣like of the People. The said Peter de Beauvoir, to prevent such as∣sembly and choice, and that those foul and enormous Actions of his should not be made manifest, not come to light, and be again com∣plained of, and charged against him, before those in authority in England; made use in Court of a fair pretence, (viz.) That one Wil∣liam Beauvoir alias du Hommet his neer Kinsman, (and whom very lately he had caused to be chosen and put in the Seat of Judicature) was going for England, and to spare the Peoples purses, he the said Wil∣liam Beauvoir would at his proper costs and charges, undertake the care of getting the ancient Charters and Priviledges of this Island confirmed, and moreover would get an augmentation of Licences for Wool, and that thenceforward the People should farm their se∣veral Tythes; and, to the end the said Bailiff might the better carry on his designe in hand, he made an additional proposition to the Court, (viz.) That in Imitation of several places in England, he thought it very fit and requisite, that an Addresse of the Magistrates and others of this Island should be made and sent unto the Protect∣or, to condole the death of his late Father, and congratulate him in his present Government: to which several propositions, the Court being demanded their Opinion, the major part of them knowing as well whereto the ends of the said Bailiff did tend, as of what ill con∣sequence such a deputation would prove, especially considering the
person proposed to be intrusted as Deputy, (viz.) the said William de Beauvoir aliàs du Hommet, who is known to be a prophane, am∣bitious, and debauched man; and one who, during the late War, was a notorious enemy against the Parliament of England, having been in Arms against them at Oxford, with his Master the Lord Downs, who raised a Troop of Horse there for the late King, for which after∣wards he compounded, and then went for Italy, and the said William Beauvoir with him, who at this very instant receivs an Annuity of the said Lord Downs, his said Master: Upon this and other weighty con∣siderations the major part of the said Court answered, That seeing the things proposed by the said Bailiff were of general concernment to the whole Island, that therefore in their opinions it was fit and requisite that the State of this Island should be summoned to assem∣ble, advise, and deliberate concerning the said proposition (as time out mind had been practised in cases of the like nature). But the said Bailiff opposed the same, by desiring and sending to the Deputy Governour not to acquiesce that the said Assembly should be sum∣moned, for several weighty reasons that he would impart unto him; And in the interim the said Bailiff got a kind of begging Addresse to be drawn, and privately sent (with a Deputation for himself and the said William Beauvoir) to the severall Parishes of this Island to get hands, which some of the People did not refuse by reason of the fair pretences therein conteined; and afterwards he, the said Bailiff, caused the said Deputation, contrary to Law, to be passed under the publique Seal of the Island, which he keeps in his Custody. All which illegal actings of the said Bayliff were effected by him against the expresse Order of the Deputy-Governour, or knowledge of the States of the said Island; which Irregular proceedings were like to have caused a tumult in the said Island. And now he is going for Jer∣sey and so for England in the Frigate that went thither to fetch Major Generall Overton: and his Colleague William de Beauvoir aliás du hommet is now going in these Vessels after him. I do not doubt but you have seen them: they are resolved to make use of all their Engines and Hypocrisies in seeming pious and Religi∣ous rather then misse of compassing their ends; and if that failes, then they are resolved to make use of money, which they have plen∣ty to bribe and corrupt those that will serve them in answering their base ends. They have boasted here openly of their friends at Court,
and what they will do for them, and for those that joyn with them; and that when all other things and means fail, that money is the onely way to do business; which I do not wonder at, seeing they are so well versed in receiving and giving: Cost what it will, they must effect something, or otherwise, their return hither will be Odious to those to whom they have made such large promises. I send you here inclosed a Copy of their flattering, profane, and begging Addresse. I wish that those in Authority may not be enchanted and deluded by them either by their feigned piety, Religious Language, not their pre∣tended affection to the Common-wealth, to which they are great Ad∣versaries: no government pleasing them but absolute Monarchy, (as they themselves exercise over the Poor and honest People of this Island, whom they can crush at pleasure, by great allyance they have in the seat of Judicature.) Pray communicate these lines to some of those of your friends, that yet remain faithful to the Interest of Gods People, and to the Common-wealth, that so they may not be sur∣prized by them; and you will do a work of merit to this poor spot of ground consisting of above Twenty thousand souls, and ingage all the well-affected and honest amongst them to pray for you; and my self, who am, Honorable Sir, Your most Humble and Obedient Servant. Guernzey Island 2. Martii 1658.
To his most Serene Highness, Richard Lord Protector of the Common∣wealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Dominions there∣unto appertaining. The humble Request of the Bayliff, Jurates, and Common Councill, and other well-affected Inhabitants of the Island of Guernzey. SHEWETH, THat having had a deep feeling in the general Consternation, which all well-affected persons have received by the death of his late most renowned Highness, They have also great share in the great Exultation, which doth possess the Hearts of all such who make profession of Piety, and who do see your Highness Act for God and his People in his Government; and as your most humble Suppliants have no∣thing more pretious then their fidelity towards your Highness, being that which doth embolden them to prostrate themselves in all Humility before your Highness, Humbly supplicating, That you will please to confirm the Priviledges, Franchises, and Immunities, which they do enjoy by their Ancient Charters; and seeing the Inhabitants of the said Isle are become very Numerous, and of above 6000 per∣sons who get their living by knitting of Stockings, and other Manufactures of Wooll, and that One Thousand Todds of it is the least quantity which is necessary for them to keep them at work; which quantity being equally distributed amongst the said persons, will not amount to more than four pounds and an half for each for one whole year: We do with all Humility supplicate your Highness, That it may please your Grace to grant to the Poor Inhabitants of the said Isle the same favour and grace, (having already been granted to the Inhabitants of Jersey, by your High∣ness most renowned Father of happy memory) and according to the cordial affection which they bear to your Highness, and their duty to addresse themselves with fer∣vour to the Throne of Grace, They pray God, that he may be pleased to continue his blessing upon your Highness Person, Posterity, and Government, &c. Signed in the Original. FINIS.
