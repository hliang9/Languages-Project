LORETTO and WINIFRED. OR, A New Way of Getting of Children, viz. By Prayers and Presents. To the Tune of Packington's Pound. YE Trickling Papists, Lady Abbess and Nuns, That are piously weak, yet fain would have Sons; The Saints must be Pray'd to, and the Priests have their Gain, Or else all your S—ving, and Praying's in vain. First you must receive The Physick they give, But an Accipe hoc, and you're sure to conceive: Then away to Bethesda, wash, give and adore, For the Church can do this, and a Thousand Things more. II. Ye languishing Wives! that are willing to Bear, Ne'er lose your Estates for want of an Heir; Hither come for Advice, for your Countenance shews Ye're Plagu'd with the Whites, and abundance of those: When once 'tis begun, The Work is half done, If the Church do but say it, be sure 'tis a Son. Then do not Dispair, though you're Barren and Sick, But try these Commanders of Placket and P—k. III. The Physick that's used, and surely will do, Is Elixir of T—'s, prepar'd you know how; It's given by Drops, in something that's warm, But a Spoonful or two, will do you no harm. Ye must not deny, But patiently lie With one of Rome's Priests, with a Crucifix by; Then never give o'er till ye've purchas'd an Heir, Thus got by the means of — Presents and Prayer. IV. Ye Men may have help too, there's nothing more apt, Though your Reins are grown weak, and confoundedly Clapt, Our Lady can do it, if you get her good Will, And a Priest S—ve your Wives to cover her Skill, She will give a Nod To show she's a God, And you must believe it though never so Odd: Then down on your Knees, and for ever Adore The Church that sends Heirs, though the Heiress be a Whore. FINIS.
