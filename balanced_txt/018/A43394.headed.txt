FOR MY SONNE Mr. WILLIAM HERBERT. HAving compiled this small Treatise, chiefly for the en∣tertainment of my selfe and private family, consisting of morall and divine princi∣ples, collected according to my severall conceptions, answerable to the distractions of these times, that neither gave me conveniency of books or liberty for con∣versation, I thought it most proper to direct the reading of these Writings more particu∣larly to your selfe then to any other: not onely in regard you are the appearing per∣son, that probably must give continuance and succession to our house, which I heartily wish may be in vertue, or not at all: but also, for
that part of the booke was written whilst my imagination was imployed in doubts and fears, concerning your late dangerous sick∣nesse, which I must confesse did not a little heighten my troubled apprehension with the consideration of all humane uncertainties, re∣solving then your losse, should have buried my principall felicities in a retired obscurity, that now for your good I am partly determi∣ned shall be further enlarged, according to conveniency and occasion: to which pur∣pose upon the same score of consideration I must conjure you to reflect often upon the extraordinary mercies of Almighty God, shewed in your behalfe, not onely in raising you unexpectedly from so hazzardable and desperate a condition of weaknesse, to a com∣petent if not a perfect degree of health and strength of body, but also that he hath been pleased to afford you many other plentifull favours, in some kinds beyond the ordinary sort of men. Wherefore as you appear by dis∣course sensible of these blessings I must advise you to carry alwaies about with you, those very thoughts you were enspired with all, (ac∣cording
to your own relation) in the greatest extremity of your sickness, as being freest from earthly passions, and those vaine ambitions, that use to corrupt the manners, if not the very understandings of most people. How∣ever I would have you believe, that I goe not about by these expressions to entangle, much∣lesse to compell you to a monasticall severity of life, but onely I endeavour by my writings and directions, to perswade and confirm you, in such a religious morality in your conver∣sation and affairs (necessary to all Christians) that may the better secure your condition both in this life and the next. And although I am confident that these generall admoni∣tions might serve for sufficient instructions to your youth, in regard I have been so wel ac∣quainted with your nature and education, yet for that I may be thought something large in my writings, concerning the extravagancies and vices of this age, I wil not let you passe in this Epistle, without some distinct advertis∣ments directed unto your selfe; however do not thinke I point personally at you in any of these particulars, onely my intention and
aimes are, by setting before your considera∣tion the inconveniencies of these passions and absurdities, you may become the more distasted with the practises of them in others; since most pittifull examples of all sorts are daily presented to your eares or eyes, especi∣ally of childrens disobedience to their pa∣rents. Truly Will: if I should have any just occa∣sion given me, to suspect your intentionall duty or filiall love, I should have cause suffici∣ent, not onely to esteem my endeavours most unfortunate, but exceedingly to doubt of your discretion, as wel as to blame your in∣gratitude; since, as you cannot but know how much your mother and my selfe have strived in your behalfe, to the uttermost of our powers: so is it unpossible in that re∣gard, you can finde more confiding persons then our selves, whereon to place your chiefe trust and confidence, either in difficulties or inconveniencies. If at all God Almighty had not added a temporall curse, to that Commandement, and to no other, which ob∣ligeth the duty of children to their parents,
besides many other fearful testimonies, I could bring, to shew a necessity of perform∣ing with all honour and respect, those filial¦ties of nature: which I onely tell you, because many young people (as I said before) in these dayes, are grown so extravagantly preposte∣rous in their courses, that scarce is there fami∣ly, but hath some cause to complain in this nature, with more then ordinary grief; where∣as in times past children thought it not onely a reputation to their own persons, to bear a respectful honour to their parents, but even with a certain kinde of admiring duty, were most careful and diligent, to imitate their ve∣ry actions, as well as to receive their instru∣ctions. Next I must minde you, of that danger∣ous and swelling disease of vain-glory, that useth to intoxicate in this age, so much the brains of young people, that as they become altogether void of any good nature at all, so not seldom being transported with this va∣nity, they appeare in some sort deprived of their wits; however I am perswaded that you have contracted such an experience by your
being abroad, and having conversed without flattery, that if at any time by accident you fall into the like errours, you will be soon a∣ble to put a bridle to the humour by some temper and diseretion. But as this inclination floweth from too great an indulgency of nature, wanting a competent judgement to discern, so is it the occasion often times, not onely of unneces∣sary and distastful contentions, but also of most desperate quarrels, proceeding from dispositions too furious, which in this place, I shall example by one short story not to be questioned for the truth thereof. Two entirely loving brothers upon occa∣sion of recreation, walking one evening with∣in the Precints of their ordinary dwelling, and beholding the skie bespotted all over with stars, one of them of a sudden wished as many fat Oxen of his own, as there appeared little lights in the Firmament; the other a∣gain, not to be behind hand with his brother as he thought in invention, also desired Pa∣storage as large as the whole Element, and then demanded how his Cattel would be fed?
the first apprehending belike indiscreetly some intention of affront to his vain▪glori∣ous conceits; in heat and choler told his brother, that they should feed in his pasture, whether he would or no: wherefore the o∣ther being also moved with passion, at this seeming intention of compulsion, hastily re∣plyed, that as by right he could not claim any interest in his Field or Medow, so was he fully resolved to debar him from all benefit and commodity therein. But in conclusion, from words they went to blowes, until at last both drawing out their weapons, which they had unfortunately about them, they soon be∣came each others murtherer, before any of the house could come to their rescue, not∣withstanding there wanted not good store of company in that noble family. Which in my opinion may be taken for a most remark∣able example of transported natures, either by vain glory or anger, especially to be pre∣vented in matters of gaming, since persons for the most part in losse, are so far from bridling their passions, that oftentimes they challenge to themselves certain priviledges to be of∣fensive,
as reflecting more upon the injurie fortune doth them, then at the equality of them that played with them, who will finde hardly temper or civility to be abused by rea∣son of such indulgent conceits, when there is no other obligation to perswade them to the supposed compliance. The desire or itching appetite of flattery, may be said also to be a property of vaine∣glory, as well as a base effect of that lunacy, which in regard it is of a dangerous conse∣quence, especially to youth, I thinke it some∣what convenient in this place to be remem∣bred: for who are addicted thus to be de∣lighted, or rather to be laid asleepe by such enchantments, must not onely still resolve to converse with fooles and knaves, that either for ends, or out of ignorance, will be ever subject to each fantasticall humour of theirs, but for the most part they shall be kept out of all eminent company, in regard that those who have gained a powerfull influence over their weaknesse, are obliged to procure them the greatest distance may be with worth and knowledge, since indifferent people without
any partiality, would be apt to discover true or false lights. Be assured that this inclina∣tion proceeds from a kind of low disposition, though extreamly swoln up with a preposte∣rous and ignorant pride, that wants sufficient courage to gain estimation by industrie; such people at last will be forced to entertaine fearce any thing else but sloth and sensuality: which is the worst condition man possibly can fall into. To avoid all these inconveniences, nothing is more proper, then to keepe alwaies the mind and the body imployed with some No∣ble activity; however it is not sufficient to be continually busied, but it will be found most necessary also to have some designe or period in the imagination; as well to know when to end, as what to begin; neither to be wea∣ried by difficulties, or altered through incon∣stancy, and so by consequence not to leave any prosecution, unlesse the judgement upon serious deliberation give a willing and know∣ing consent: for no doubt as the Word is most composed of craft and ignorance, so will there not want perpetually aboundance
of alluring diversions: in that people for the most part cannot well brook worth in an∣other, since they are resolved not to take the pains for it themselves, and therefore will endeavour rather to undermine reputations by detraction, then hope to equall vertues by industry. If you doe well, you must look ra∣ther to be spighted then commended; and if you doe ill, you may onely purchase some little compliance with your perdition. Last of all, I would not have you too much either to reflect upon our past felicities, or too feelingly apprehend our present misfor∣fortunes; since both the one and the other may seem past recovery; yet as we have suffer∣ed something injuriously, though perhaps but equal with others of the same quality and prosperity, so aparantly have we beheld in all our sufferings, evident signes of Gods mer∣cies towards us, not onely in delivering us from many hazards and dangers, with a con∣venient supply alwayes when our necessities were most pressing; but also hath formed your education, out of these troubles; which I dare be bold to say (in your own thoughts)
you value more then a great deal of worldly fortune. However, it is not sufficient onely to have these conceits and opinions, but with industry and discretion, you are to make use of both what you have, and what you have not, by pitching upon some laudable settle∣ment for your future conveniencie and subsi∣stence, in which course, in despight of all ma∣lice and enticements, I would have you to be resolute, and so little ashamed of the profes∣sion and practice of Religion and Honour, that boldly you are not onely to love and cherish those vertues in your self, but publike∣ly to countenance them wheresoever you shall finde them in others, in so doing, you shall ever oblige me to rest, Your most affectionate Father PERCIE HERBERT.
To the Reader. I Muste confesse, when first I fell upon the determination, to exer∣cise my Pen in a subject of this nature, I never thought my endeavours should have past further then the bounds of my own family; but being since perswaded by some reasons (which I need not expresse) to make my writings more publique; as also not well knowing what certaine habitation I shall be master of in these distracted times, when as oppression already hath dealt so hardly with me, I have caused these conceptions of mine to be printed, that they may also (if there be occasion) seeke their own fortune in the World, though I feare they will not finde competent entertainment, in regard they seem not much (perhaps not at all) to suit with the consti∣tution of the age; at least they appeare not any way ambitious, after the customes now chiefly in fashi∣on; although I can confidently assure the Reader, that as they are not any way painted and flouri∣shed, whereby to procure the better acceptance, so
in the inside are they purely without hypocrisie and ostentation, having no plot at all to deceive the World. Whereupon I must take so much boldnesse, as to require those who at any time shall cast their eyes, if not their intentions upon these lines with some curious appetite, that they will yet doe me so much right (though they should want thereby their own satisfaction) as to proceed in a methodicall way, in their passing over the Chapters, lest what I intend for something may prove nothing to their apprehensions, for want of sufficient order and patience to consider; and the rather may I expect this curtesie (if you will let it be a charity) for that the book it selfe is so extreame short, that if I did not intend to enlarge it by a second part, I might be something ashamed that the presse under my name and solicitation, hath been employed with so small a Pamphlet, and therefore consequently can give the Reader no excessive trouble, to take the more deliberation in the truer understanding of my in∣tentions, which may prove far more satisfactory to us both if this course be observed: and also do desire that he will be pleased to excuse and rectifie those Faults that have escaped in the printing, by his own judgement, which the sense will sufficiently direct him unto, without any great difficulty.
THE INTRODUCTION, OR INDUCEMENT Of the whole BOOK. AS most people in our age do furiously complain of their own sufferings, ra∣ther quarrelling with the Times, then with their Vices: So the late Act of Confinement, contributing very little benefit or opportunity to the delight of Conversation, gives me leasure and convenien∣cy enough, not onely to exercise my several imagi∣nations in many extravagant Fancies, as well con∣cerning my own Crosses, as other mens Actions; but other whiles more seriously to recollect toge∣ther
those Cogitations in a Method, whereby I might pick out of them some advantages towards my particular Use and Comodity. And to this purpose, although I would not have any think, that I intend presumptuously to be an instructor of o∣thers (it neither being proper for my Profession, or within the compass of my Ability, however I must confess my desires therein are competently chari∣table;) yet I conceive it most agreeing with my intentions in some orderly way to put down my conceptions in writing, that they be the better sixt in my memory when I shall have occasion to put in execution the effects of this necessary contempla∣tion. Wherefore if any shall demand either why I write at all, or make election of no meaner a Sub∣ject, as it may be thought, beyond the reach of my seeming Capacity: My reply must be, that as the first part of the Question is already answered, by my not having for the present any passable imploy∣ment, either at home or abroad; so the latter will quickly finde this Reply, by reason of one Princi∣pal, grounded strongly in my minde, that slight and impertinent Discourses are most unfit for this in∣temperate and licentious Season; which being al∣lowed me, I must take leave to say, as well as to think, that notwithstanding there are very many, as I intimated before, extream sensible of their suf∣ferings in these days of tribulation, because they feel the smart of their green Wounds newly made; yet I am confident there are very few that do abso∣lutely believe the inflammation proceeds from a se∣cret Poyson long time ago ingendered in the heart
of this Nation; wherefore if men would but look back upon the Posture of this Kingdom in the be∣ginning of these Wars, at what time I may bodly affirm, scarse any Vertue was practiced with confi∣dence and assurance, those thoughts perhaps would soon finde a way to judge from what Original these misfortunes have proceeded: Again, of the other∣side if we can open our eyes for the present, at the continuance, if not increase of Sin and Vice, not to be paraleld perchance by former Stories, we may without over much difficulty be perswaded that in a manner it is unpossible, God Almighty should yet withdraw his heavy hand of punishment from off our Countrey; For as in the general we had expe∣rience, the Nobility were degenerated, the Gen∣try corrupted, Women grown impudent, and the common People Atheistical; so may we perceive now, by a strict enquiry, that at present the very Natures and Dispositions of most Persons are changed into a certain kinde of strange Lunacy, or preposterous Madness in their Actions, as if some ominous Revolution were yet to be made in this Nation: Which I must confess hath not onely of∣tentimes amazed my own private thoughts, but makes me conclude, that as these wonderful In∣sensibilities and Impieties, proceed from some fa∣tal displeasure of Heaven, so of necessity must the Causes of these Ills arise, either from the believing there is no God, that Jesus Christ was not the true Saviour of the World; from some high and perem∣ptory presumption of his mercies, or from too much stupidity in peoples apprehensions, procee∣ding
from the inchantment of fleshly Appetites. To all which we will speak somthing in particular, since my intentions are by this Discourse to re∣member the imperfections of the Times, for my Own and Families Admonition. Against Atheism. IN the first Place, if any do suppose, that there is no God, or omnipotent Disposer of all things, with a certain kinde of order, but as if by chance every creature did produce and suffer increase and diminution, without any further design and in∣tention, the opinion is not onely most ridiculous, but even repugnant to Nature it self, which seems to pretend an orderly Rule in all her Actions and Effects; for that besides the general confusion it would soon bring upon each production, in regard Seeds in every Species, could not in a short time but jar amongst themselves, wanting the true mixture, by the application of those helps necessary for In∣crease and Continuance, as Sun and Rain with the like, without which all generations would quick∣ly perish, it is evident the ancient Philosophers meerly by the compulsion of Reason, without any manner of Revelation from Heaven, were forced against their Wills and Appetites not onely to con∣fess some Supernatural and Divine Operatour, that made the World and commanded at first the course
of the Heavens, with the influence of the Planets, that they might be proportionable to the Commo∣dity and Subsistence of lower Motions; But also acknowledged one single Essence and Deity, as Ma∣ster of every Creation, since they knew divided Powers could not be omnipotent, in respect they might have several Wills which must needs pro∣duce diverse Effects tending to confusion, by which means things would not be conveniently governed and ordered to Subsistence and Increase: Besides, we may fall upon this consideration, that there was never yet any people upon earth, how Barbarous soever in their understanding, and rude and igno∣rant in their conversations, though separated from all possibility of Instruction, but by the very docu∣ments of Nature it self, did use a formal Sacrifice, or exteriour Worship to some god or other, whom they did in a sort fear and reverence, though they had not knowledge sufficient by education, to di∣stinguish rightly who he was, or what were his At∣tributes: Again, it hath been observed that scarce any Atheist, how wilde and blasphemous soever, in his discourses, and infamous and dissolute in his course of life, but at the sudden apprehension of death or some other imminent danger, would seem to cast up his eyes to Heaven, as demanding a kind of assistance in his necessity, being induced there∣unto, onely by a natural instinct of feare, though perhaps in perfect safty, he would be either of ano∣ther opinion, or of a different comportment; which shews there is somthing supernatural, that compelleth man to acknowledge and reverence his
Creator, let his will be never so perverse, who must be honoured in spight of all wickedness: Further let us but cast our looks upon the Plants of the Earth, with their wonderful effects, and we shall see every where, such diversity of kinds, both in shew and operation, and yet proceeding but from one Womb, that it would amaze our consideration to learn to know how they could be distinguished in their growth, not having any relation at all to each other, which certainly cannot be without some Divine providence: In like manner we may behold every little Bird naturally to have a sever∣al way of building its Nest, according to the same Species he is of, which Form constantly he main∣tains though he be never so far distant from others of that kinde, however he is not capable, either of art or imitation, and with all as soon as the young are out of the shell, they can readily without in∣struction, provide for their own safety and commo∣dity, without Practice or Information, whether it be to defend themselves, against the violence of ravenous creatures, though they never saw the like before, or to seek those nutriments which their welfare requires: As for example Ducks presently after they are hatched will covet the water, though Chickings cannot by any means be induced to en∣ter into a pool, for fear of being drowned, for that Nature teacheth them they may not swim, having no other experience for that Science, then what their omnipotent Creator hath Divinely infused into them for their preservation: Whereas of the contrary man is not endued with such timely
foresight (though he be of a far more noble making) because his wise God sees it not necessary for his present being, in that he hath ordained him reason∣able creatures for his defence, and to take care of him whilest he is young, which I say shews a high providence beyond all dispute: Again, who is it hath placed so admirable a property in the Load∣stone, and keeps the Sea within his bounds? not∣withstanding the continual course of so many Ri∣vers, which else would exceede according to the rule of other waters, to the destruction of the whole World, but he that hath designed all things to work convenient effects, by his omnipotency towards preservation, since no Schollership or Learning is able to give convincing Testimonies of either: And last of all it may be considered, that man being the noblest of Creatures visible, if there were not somthing above him, he himself should be the or∣derer of nature, since all things else we see want Sence or Reason, and man also not knowing its ut∣termost bounds, we must conclude he was created by a more excellent Essence; As for Example, we see this huge Ball of the Earth hangs in the ayre, without any support, contrary to the nature of all solid bodies that ever fall downwards, by the meer compulsion of their weight; so that of neces∣sity there is somthing more powerful then Nature, that commands it against its course, which cannot be man, because he is not onely ignorant of this, but many other misteries. Again, it is unpossible that Nature can be this omnipotent Eternity, for that we see her in most things subject to accident,
and apparantly decays dayly in her productions, which shews she is not Perfect and Independant, and therefore can be no god; for man being her best piece, is born infirm, lives a time with trouble, and at last dyes by Violence or Age, all which seems to be to little purpose, for the being of the World, without any other designe or end: Wherefore we may conclude, that somthing above either man or nature must needs order all things according to his pleasure, for some use more then ordinary, since certainly his works can be no more in vain, then himself can be without eternity, and how his in∣tensions can be less then to an eternal end: I can∣not see the least reason, that ought to administer any occasion of dispute, however for orders sake, we may discourse in this manner. For the Im∣mortality of the soul.That as this mighty omnipotent and all power∣ful God, hath here created a most large and beauti∣ful World, full of all kinde of useful varieties, so must this world be created to some other effects, then onely to produce and consume, without any other purpose or designe: And what could the in∣tention of this creation be, but to preserve some immortal thing, ordained for Gods own proper and particular Use and Service, which can never end? neither is it possible that this thing, or sub∣ject of Gods intention, can be any other, then mans reasonable Soul, in which he hath placed so clear an understanding, differing from all creatures else in a most high measure, since Beasts, Birds, and the like, are endued onely with Life and Sense, whereas man alone enjoys the fruition of Reason, by which
he comes to know, the very nature almost of all other things: But here perhaps may be alledged, that we give too great a prerogative to mans Soul, since he doth no more exceed other creatures in knowledge, then one creature seems to pass ano∣ther in subtilty, which shews degrees, as they say, of excellency in ordination, though not perfection in mans Creation: Unto which Objection, I shall briefly make this Answer, That as it had been an needless or impertinent thing (as I intimated be∣fore) for God Almighty, to have made the World with its Beauties, meerly for mans Subsistence (as being held the best of Creatures) and himself to be created to no other end, but onely to live and dye, and others to succeed him, which is nothing else, but to go round in a Circle, without either design, intention or purpose; Which certainly as this can∣not stand with the nature of Gods Wisdom, so of the other side, it may easily be determined, by any reasonable judgement, how far the capacity of mans soul goes beyond the understanding of all other creatures, that were ever yet made in the world, since he is able, a knowing way by the very strength of reason, not onely in times of danger and neces∣sity, to call upon his Maker with some confidence for assistance, (which no other living thing will be able to do, by all the instruction can be infused into him by humane Art whatsoever) but even in some sort, can define his Creators very Nature and Es∣sence, by those Rules given him by Divinity and Philosophy, allowing and disproving them if there be occasion, by his own natural Reason and Ap∣prehension:
Which is a difference of so high a pre∣rogative, that by it we resemble Gods own Image, in foreseeing, judging, and distinguishing of good and evil, right and wrong, as also between igno∣rance and science, whereas other creatures carry a∣bout with them only Sense and Memory, that serves them but for subsistence and preservation, be∣ing all they need for the end they were made, which was alone for mans use and commodity: For no person in his right wits will tell me that an Elephant, or a Fox (they being esteemed the wisest, and most intelligible of creatures) can be instructed by all the learning in the world, for never so many years to∣gether, to govern a Kingdom, lead an Army, or give convenient Counsel in matters of difficulty, much less to know the orderly course of the Pla∣nets: Wherefore I must conclude, that as there is no comparison between mans Understanding, and other Animals, of what excellency soever, so God Almighty having given mans reasonable soul, so principal a preheminency above other creatures, it must be that if any thing ordained for eternity, and eternal somthing must be (as I said before) for which this great world was made, since his Wis∣dom, Goodness, and omnipotency, could not act a∣ny thing in vain, which of necessity must follow, if man should onely live to dye after a while, with∣out injoying any further happiness or end: As for Example, it would be esteemed a very great mad∣ness (or at leastwise a palpable indiscretion in hu∣mane Actions) for any person to breed and nourish living creatures, without some intention, either
to supply his necessities or please his senses: Much more ridiculous to think God Almighty (that is not subject at all to error) should create and pre∣serve what, he did not intend for some purpose: Wherefore I say this divine Essence, as he cannot be capable of these or any other Passions and Defects, so would he not have made this world, without an intention conducing to eternity for their sakes, to whose use the earth was ordained at the first: Since all his operations can tend to no lower an end in every of his Works, which must be infinite like to himself: of the other side, certainly this Object of his, can be no other then the Soul of man; he one∣ly of all other creatures, being indued with a rea∣sonable and noble Understanding, and therefore pleased it should participate of a Glory (out of his infinite mercy) that could not be created, because his sublime goodness never intended any thing di∣rectly for destruction, but by way of accident, or rather provoked thereunto by his necessary Justice for his eternal Honour: But if mans reasonable Soul should be Mortal, as some Fools perhaps may ridiculously suppose, what priviledge hath his ex∣cellent creation above other inferiour creatures, over whom he is ordained Lord and Master, nay rather I may say apparent disadvantages, since not onely most living things exceed him in the Facul∣ties, and Use of their Senses, but also in not being subject to the unhappiness of the perturbation of the minde, upon the arival of worldly accidents, which may be esteemed the greatest afflictions of this Life: for that foreknowledge and apprehen∣sion
of Death, or Miseries before they come, are a continual discomforture to all present Delights, and an interruption to that content, which should render him happy and pleased within himself; Whereas unreasonable creatures want those per∣turbations of thought and apprehension, to afflict them: So that if man had not Immortality to ex∣pect, in lieu of such sufferings, I might truly affirm his Creator had done him much injury in giving him a reasonable Soul, to his further disquiet and vexation, and might justly conclude him more un∣fortunate in his creation, then all those creatures, over whom he is designed to govern; which cer∣tainly his good and wise God never intended him, since he was pleased to make him so excellent in his understanding: And so I end with Atheism, though I must again fall upon a new Dispute, concerning Infidelity, which is no other, then to doubt some∣thing of the Person or Passion of our Saviour. That our Saviour was the true Messias. WE shall begin with the time of Christs com∣ing in the Flesh, which apparently was fore∣told, should be when the Jews Scepter was to be taken away from the right Line, and a general Peace proclaimed over the face of the Earth: Both these, I say, were punctually fulfilled at his Blessed Birth; insomuch as not onely Herod who then wore the
Diadem of Jury, was a meer stranger as well by Ex∣traction as by Nation, but also the Temple of Ianus, was then shut up in Rome, the accustomed Ceremo∣ny belonging to such a Iubily of Pacification: Next it was plainly Prophesied by many places in Holy Scripture, that the Iews in time to come, should be discarded for their impiety, and the Gentiles to be Elected in their Rooms: All which we see at this day so exactly performed, that they are not onely scattered over the Earth without Ho∣nour or Dominion (being a Scandal and Reproach to all other Countries) but have not so much, as either Temple or Priest, to offer their Sacrifice or exercise their Rights, whilst of the contrary, we behold the Christian Religion, most gloriously to flourish amongst the Gentiles, almost over the whole world, to the absolute abolishing of all the ancient Idols, which in the Primitive times were so gene∣rally esteemed and worshipped, that whosoever re∣fused their adorations, were to undergo the worst of torments, for their contempt; however, this Faith of ours had no visible encouragement to hu∣mane eyes; but of the contrary, was frighted by horrid terrours received from the blood of Martyrs, and yet these people were onely perswaded to their constant and admirable belief, by the poor and sim∣ple Preaching of a few unlearned and contemptible Fishermen, insomuch, as great and wise Doctors in a manner in an instant, gave up their lives willingly, to most exasperated and cruel Tyranny, in witness and confirmation of that blessed Truth, notwith∣standing the opinions themselves that they were
taught, were against all appetites, and Sense of man, which of necessity must imply, that these strange and suddain opperationses, could proceed from no other thing but divine instigation: Be∣sides, we see according to many Predictions of the Prophets, that Kings and Queens, are become nur∣sing fathers and mothers to this holy Faith, with so much alacrity, that they are not onely content to submit to the Churches jurisdiction, but in a man∣ner lay down their glorious Crowns and Scepters, (with the more humility) to prostrate their per∣sons, at the steps of this Tribunal: which cer∣tainly is beyond all humane apprehension to con∣ceive; since neither honour, profit, nor worldly felicity, seems to attend the intention of their practices: Neither had the Doctrine at the first, (as I say) any probability to be believed; for that it taught such strange and unheard of mysteries, that could not come almost within the compass of any brain to invent. And surely if man onely had been the Author of this change, he would have devised some more easie way to have pleased flesh and blood, or to have better satisfied peoples understandings: much less would Jesus Christ in the very infancy of this belief, have subjected not onely himself, but all his Disciples, to such penuri∣ons want, and most intolerable torments; accom∣panyed with nothing else but contempt and scorn, without any hope at all, either of benefit, honour, or reward, if as an Impostor onely, he had inten∣ded the deceiving of the people, for his own vain glory. Next, if we consider, the most woful and
lamentable destruction of Ierusalem, to happen so directly according to our Saviours saying, though that City was then at the present, in an extraordi∣nary flourishing condition; and in a perfect sub∣jection to the Romans, whose Emperour the inha∣bitants professed to serve, love, and honour, be∣fore all the world, we may easily perceive, that no less then a Divine Spirit could have uttered those Prophesies, as also hapning immediately af∣ter his death and passion, it was most apparant, a heavenly hand onely punished their impiety, both for the cruelty used towards his person, as in re∣gard of their obstinacy in refusing his Doctrine, de∣nying him to be their spiritual King: which curse also hath continued ever since upon their condition as a remarkable plague for their ingratitude; whilst of the contrary (as we see) God Almighty hath advanced his own glory every where, by stri∣king dumb all the Oracles of the Divel, notwith∣standing they have been violently supported, by the Art and power of tyrannical Princes over the world: until at last, we may behold these great Monarchs of the the earth, forced to submit them∣selves to the belief and jurisdiction of that seem∣ing contemptible Church in the beginning, which they had most maliciously persecuted; insomuch, as at this present, there is not to be found any Na∣tion or persons, of the Pagan Religion any where; however that opinion was wont to entertain the pens and actions of multitudes of great and lear∣ned Philosophers, for many hundreds of yeers to∣gether, accompanyed with the delusions of their
false gods; which now are all vanished into smoak; and the Christian Faith alone dilated amongst the Gentiles everywhere, to the wonder of all humane consideration; again, we may reflect upon that saying of holy Scripture, as a further testimony to this Truth, against the Jewes: I have no will in your offerings, nor gifts will I receive at your hands, for from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same, my Name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place there shall be sacrificing, and a pure offering offered to my Name: Which intimates no other, then that the Jewes were to be despised and turned off, and the Gentiles introduced into their places. A Pro∣phecie so plainly verified in these dayes, that we do not onely see, the Jewes and their Religion laid aside, with the general calling of the Gentiles, but also this oblation every where offered by the Chri∣stians, consisting onely in one thing, and perfor∣med after one manner, though in many places; whereas the Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Jews were divers, both in matter and form, as well as the performing thereof was confined to one place: besides, we might bring not onely the Confessions of the heathen Oracles themselves, for the Divini∣ty and Godhead of our Saviour, but the ancient prophecies of the Sibyls, allowed, approved, and preserved; with a great deal of veneration by the Roman Monarchy and other Commonwealths, if there were any need either to strengthen our Testi∣monies, or confute other opinions; to which we may adde these considerations, that it is not pro∣bable that so poor a beginning as had first the Chri∣stian
Religion, against the sense and appetite of hu∣mane nature, persecuted with violence in the very infancy of the Church, countenanced by none but despicable people, and the belief of it self ground∣ed only on imaginable fruition, her mysteries in a manner not being conceiveable almost by the high∣est capacity, should so suddainly increase, and so long continue, notwithstanding all the oppositions from time to time sustained, both from Craft and Tyranny; if this sacred Truth were not supported by an omnipotencie, not to be contended against by all the power of earth and Hell: Wherefore I must conclude, that as these proofs are sufficient to any indifferent understanding, whereby to con∣vince all men of Infidelity, touching the Divinity of our Saviour, and the truth of his suffering for our offences; so are we obliged to observe his pre∣cepts in particular, if we hope to receive bene∣fit by his death, as they are declared in the same ho∣ly Scriptures. And consequently ought, under the pain of a most terrible condemnation to abate in us, if not the appetites, yet at leastwise the pra∣ctice and violence of sin, that seems in this corrupt age, to take so much possession of our persons and actions, as if Religion were turned, onely to a vast Chaos of confused liberty, without temper or morality. In which wild exercise of preposterous sensuali∣ty, perhaps many are confirmed out of some pre∣sumptuous hope, that God Almighty doth not readily look upon the transgressions of guilty of∣fenders.
The punishment of the Angels against all vain Presumption. AGainst which pernicious fancie, may be brought this Discourse, First we will begin with the Angels before the creation of the world, as it may be believed according to some opinions, who were the perfectest of all creatures, & in whom God intended not only to shew his power & good∣ness, but his Justice and hate of sin, for as he made them in the highest degree of happiness, to ex∣press his Majesty; so he punished their single of∣fence, to shew his equity, not in any kinde pardon∣ing them, in regard of the sublimity of their ma∣king, since knowing him best in doing any thing against his Divinity, they could not but offend him most; wherefore he, as I say, neither put limitation nor condition to their punishments; for as his om∣nipotency was by them more cleerly discerned, by reason of their excellent nature, so was the e∣ternity of their unhappiness to be without redem∣ption, for abusing so much that knowledge, the more justly inflicted upon them, both for our fu∣ture examples, that we might not too much presume and for the declaration of his own glory, who will be always just: each appearing as well in the blas∣phemies of the damned, as in the adoration of the blessed; since all creatures actions are alike to his
Godhead, neither rendring him more nor less then he is: for as by the participation onely of his good∣ness, we receive benefit according to that obedi∣ence we shew in performing his Commandments, so of the contrary, if we do not fullfil his will, we must not think to escape correction, because he ne∣ver goes from himself; for he can no more comply with sin, then he can lay down his Divinity; being both attributes of his eternal essence: and there∣fore, as he spared not these excellent spirits, meerly out of his justice, though it were but onely in one single thought of pride, we must not think to be protected by his mercy, committing dayly so many crimes. In the next place we must reflect upon the pu∣nishment of man for his transgression,The punish∣ment of man for his trans∣gression in Pa∣radise. who as he had less knowledge of his Creator in his sinning, so was he more gently used in Gods indignation; for notwithstanding he deserved also a perpetual con∣demnation for his offence, in regard of the eternal majesty against whom he rebelled, yet by reason of the natural frailty of his condition, by which he was more subject to erre in being made of earth, God was pleased to annex certain conditions, and pro∣visoes to the sentence; nevertheless, with so high a consideration of his own justice, that he would no otherwise give him any hope of pardon, then by the assurance of the death of his onely son; ha∣ving decreed in his eternal wisdome, that no lower a price could make satisfaction, to appease his divine wrath conceived against man, for having broken his Commandments, then an omnipotent pawn,
since as man had offended his Creator, no less then a Creator was to redeem the offence; by reason of his heavenly justice, that necessarily seemed to ex∣act so high a condition: wherefore, as I say, there was no other way left, but for the Son of God to take upon him our flesh and blood, because as God in his own nature could not suffer, so our nature onely could not satisfie, without some divine con∣junction; which are most convincing Arguments to shew the extream severity of God Almighties ju∣stice, when he would not fall upon any other means for our Redemption: however, we see that al∣though the Son of God was designed to perform this mysterious service to his Father, for our bene∣fit; which goodness is not to be comprehended by all the mortal thoughts in the world, much less to be requited by any humane action or endeavour; yet for all this excessive love expressed to mankind, God was not pleased presently to bring him into Heaven, or place him again in his earthly Paradise, but on the contrary, enjoyned him a continual pe∣nance, which was, to get his living all the days of his life by the sweat of his brows, and withal or∣dained his wife to bring forth children with pain and travail, as temporal punishments designed to each, whereby they might also in their own persons satisfie Gods justice, in regard of their own first diso∣bedience, over and besides the sufferings of our Sa∣viour: which playnly demonstrateth, that this great God of ours will not be so easily pacified, however the presumption and lunatick fancies of many, may suggest to their overweening appetites, a hope to
enter into heaven, accompanied with all the de∣lights of the world; as if we were here only for our pleasures, and not for the necessary maintenance of a pilgrimage upon earth, which is to work forth our salvation with industry, care and trembling. Again, we may consider Cain, the first man that was born of a woman,The punish∣ment of Cain. who however his sin was ex∣traordinary, yet the original proceeded from a kind of penuriousness in his nature, onely to preserve his best things from the consuming fire of Sacrifice, which notwithstanding was so resented by his Lord and Maker, that he not onely permitted him to fall into those horrid crimes of envy and murther, but presently chased him from the society of all good people, with a kinde of a loathing terrour to him∣self, laying a general curse upon his whole posteri∣ty, who after were totally destroyed in the univer∣sal stood, with those they had corrupted, for whose punishment that deluge was sent upon the face of the earth, as an apparant mark of Gods indignation against wicked persons, who are not alwayes alone chastised for the offences they commit, but also of∣tentimes in their posterity; since it is not to be doubted, but some of those that perished in the ge∣neral destruction pleased God in their actions, as is intimated by the second Epistle of St. Peter. Next we will remember Cham,The chastise∣ment of Cham. the unfortunate son of Noah, who onely for his irreverence to his fa∣thers frailty, was eternally punished; upon which occasion receiving his curse, he was instantly banish∣ed from his presence, and for his offence became the father of a most impious and rebellious Nation,
both against God and man: insomuch as tyrannical Nimrod his grandchild, after he had presumptuously made war against heaven, in the building of that stupendious Tower of Babel, where his proud works were confounded by the diversity of langua∣ges, he set up the first Idolatry, causing himself to be worshipped as a God: from whence hath proceed∣ed errour, wickedness and damnation ever since to people, until the force of our blessed Saviours bit∣ter Passion absolutely destroyed all those lying O∣racles, that so long deluded the earth, with the false opinions of that pretended true Religion. The affliction of the Jewes.Here we must introduce the story of the Jewes: A people particularly elected out of mankinde, to be the objects of Gods love and care, as another example of his justice: for, however their punish∣ments were but proportionable to their knowledge of his Divine essence, in regard they were not so perfect as Adam, to understand his will and pleasure, who in Paradise had absolute power to forbear sin, and do good; so were their chastisements for the most part but temporary and worldly; not imposed upon them and their posterity eternal∣ly as his was: yet if we look upon their many suf∣ferings and captivities, we shall finde, notwithstan∣ding that God Almighty did not forget their offen∣ces, permitting but two of all that numerous Army, that came out of Aegypt, to enter into the Land of Promise, the onely hope and desired period of all their tedious travels; in which number Moses that most excellent servant of God, and indefatigable Captain, also was included, by reason of some small
defect, in the execution of his Office, which not one∣ly shews the impartiality of God Almighties ju∣stice, as well towards those he loves, as to them he hates, but may very cleerly admonish us against the fancy of presumption, in that our Creator can no more comply with sin, or pardon it without our repentance and satisfaction, then he can leave off the Attributes of his own Divinity and Omnipo∣tency. Again,The punish∣ment of Eli the Priest, with Saul and others we may consider the rigid severity of his justice, in the further progresse of this story, how∣ever to avoid prolixity, we shall onely name a few examples of those particular persons, he seemed most to favour: and to this purpose, passing by ma∣ny others most exemplar: we will begin with Eli, Samuels master, who was a man neither of an ill in∣clination, or visibly much defective in his Office: yet we read, that by reason of that remissnesse, he used in not punishing and reforming his children, and those Priests under his charge (being admo∣nished thereunto) he not onely was chastised with the lamentable news of the death of both his sons, & the taking of the Ark by the Philistins, according as it was foretold, but suddenly broke his neck, falling from his seat, as the report was made unto him of those misfortunes: next we may reflect upon King Saul, whom God Almighty had onely pickt out to be the Prince of his people, though after∣wards he became the subject of his wrath: for not en∣during to hear the praises of David, whom he seem∣ed to envy, preferring his own vain-glory before the will of God, in a short time he fell to be such a
wards became a also monument of destruction, in only looking back upon that dreadful spectacle con∣trary to Gods commandment, perhaps with some re∣pining appetites, in regard of those pleasures she was unwillingly forced to foregoe. The children of Israels sen¦suality punish∣ed.Again, it is to be noted, that the children of Israel having freed themselves from their intolerable sla∣very of Egypt, by their miraculous passing the Red Sea, under the conduct of Moses: yet because in their journey (with too much sensuality) they called to minde the flesh pots they had left behinde, were not onely continued wandring in the Desarts of Arabia, for forty yeers together, bitten with Ser∣pents, and often times pined with hunger, but at last lost their lives, and wasted out their dayes, in that peregrination, insomuch, as but two persons onely of the whole numerous company (as I said before) born in Egypt, were permitted by the just judgement of Almighty God, to enter into the Land of Promise, which flowed with milk and ho∣ney, notwithstanding God Almighty had designed them to be his elected people; and whose posteri∣ty afterward, accordingly did supplant other Na∣tions. From this Discourse, we will proceed to the con∣sideration, of the several fates of the four great Empires of the world,The fate of the four Monar∣chies of the world, and first of the Assyri∣ans. since they are so largely men∣tioned in holy Scripture, to be Prophetically figu∣red by divine revelation. To which purpose, we may begin with the Assyrians, in order to ancient Histories, as well humane as sacred, wherein it is recorded, that when as Balthazar the last King, per∣ceived
the judgement of God pronounced both a∣gainst his life and Dominion, by the dreadful hand∣writing upon the Wall, which none could interpret but Daniel; himself and his Concubines, were then riotously feasting without care or trouble, in the mighty City of Babylon, which according to the fore∣said Prediction, Cyrus that very night took by sur∣prize, not onely to their confused amazement, but in confirmation of Gods indignation against such sensual stupidity, that leaves not men any appre∣hension of their own danger: wherein may be also noted, that as the fall of this great Empire was pro∣bably a stupid sensuality, since the Monarch himself did not sufficiently apprehend his danger, whereby to be careful enough, to provide resistance against his enemy, being so neer him; so of the other side, it pleased Almighty God to demonstrate unto him his own terrible fate, when he was acting the high∣est expressions of his luxuries and insensibility, as a more remarkable judgement against that horrid and beastly sin. But however the Persians by this fatal and sudden conquest,Of the Persi∣ans. made themselves Masters of the Assyrian Monarchy, which they continued with property for some generations, yet it was not long, before they also fell into extream riots, and carelesness both of their persons and honours; insomuch, as we reade, that certain Embassadours being sent from Persia into Greece, and there feasted by a King of Ma∣cedon, they became so insolently debauched, con∣trary to the customes of that more temperate Coun∣try, that they peremptorily demanded, to have the
conversation, and company of the Grecian Ladies at their entertainment, which they supposed durst not be denyed them with a liberal freedom, as a right appertaining as they thought, to the prerogative of their calling, in being messengers, sent from the greatest Monarch in the world; but the young Prince, (though his father at the present was some∣thing afraid, to contradict their humours) disdain∣ing their carriage and insolent demands, caused both himself, and some other noble men of the Court, to be disguised in womens apparel; and in this posture again entring the room, when the Em∣bassadours began to be rude and lascivious, they suddenly drew out certain weapons, which to that purpose they had secretly hid under their garments, and fell upon these companies with so much fury, that their lives quickly payed the price of their in∣humanity; which notwithstanding, ingendred such a quarrel between the two Nations, that never ended until Alexander the great became absolute master of both, by the overthrow of the last Darius, who also came to battle against him triumphing, with all his Concubines in a most profuse way of sensuality; which presently after was punished, not onely in the absolute losse of all his vast Dominions, but by a most lamentable and ignominious death in his own person. Which conquest brought the Monarchy of the world to the Grecian power,Of the Greci∣an Monarchy. until their licentious∣ness also lost it to the Romans: for Percius their last King, having by his unworthy and false disposition, exasperated the Senate of Rome, they sent the Con∣sul
Paulus Aemylius into Greece, with a strong Army to chastise him for his basenesse; whom being over∣come and brought with some intention of honour (in regard of his quality) to the presence of the General: yet behaving himself most poorly and ignominiously, unbecoming his person, though in his prosperity he was both proud and sensual, he was so disdained by the Consul, and hated by the souldi∣ers, that presently after the triumph, he was put to a most cruel death in Prison by his keepers, who could not endure his person: whilst in the interim his eldest son and heir, became a common Regi∣ster in Rome, the onely means left him to gain his subsistence. And thus ended also that great and sometimes fa∣mous Empire,The fate or declining of the Roman Empire by reason of lux∣ury. which continued in the Romans the last of the four, until that Empire became in pro∣cess of time also drowned in luxury, according to the report of many authentical Authors, who affirm that Brutus and Cassius were held to be the last of the Romans, or onely brave persons of the age, endued with noble Spirits, and free from sloathful sensuali∣ty, insomuch, as that once gallant people within some yeers, were absolutely captivated again, under a base & slavish Tyranny, as they had been formerly by licentious Tarquin, though some gallant men now and then appeared amongst them: which Dominion remained uncertainly flowing, from one Tyrant to another, till the unlearned Turks (that at present enjoy the fruitfullest of their Dominions) became Masters of their chief Country (as namely Greece) that in past ages was esteemed Mistress of the world,
both for Art and Valour, whilst temperance go∣verned her actions: though now it be become of so base a production, that the people thereof have left them neither Science nor courage, but of the contra∣ry, are wrought at present into so unworthy a stupi∣dity, with their continual excesses, that (as 'tis ob∣served in their dispositions) they would not be de∣livered from their slavery if they might, lest they might be put to the exercise of any laborious indu∣stry in the world, according to the custom of other free Nations; and in this condition are content to see their children taken from them by force, to be used at the pleasure of their Lords; either to be sold in the common Markets, or reserved for the vilest Offices. As these examples are convincing enough, to shew the judgements of God upon sensual and luxurious Countries in the general,Concerning the change in our own native Country. so may we turn our eyes of consideration upon our own kingdome, which no doubt (as I have said before) abounded with all manner of vice, before these late troubles began; insomuch as I am most confident, that the sins of the Nation without limitation, have been the chie∣fest causes of our misfortune and present miseries; which certainly requires rather an acknowledge∣ment by sack-cloth and ashes, then an indulgent fancy to flatter our hopes, with amendment of the times. To this purpose we may call to minde, the flourishing state of our Country not many yeers since; when every man seemed in peace with a most quiet security, to sit under his own Vine-Tree; whereas now we enjoy nothing certain but troubles
and vexations: the Nobility possessed priviledges of Princes, that now are scarce equal to Shoo-makers: the Gentry living in their brave houses furnished with all kinde of varieties both for pleasure and profit, and now those that are yet left standing, serve them but for more convenient prisons: the Commonalty that were accustomed to pay nothing out of their estates, are now constrained to defray the expences of many Armies, that scarce will let suffer them one night to lie in their beds quietly: the Clergy that bore jurisdiction in their several Pa∣rishes and Provinces, are now forced to quit their habitations and livings; the Lawyers that comman∣ded respect and money from Clyents, know not at present what Law is to be observed: the U∣niversities filled every where with dainty wits and Learning, are derided for their over much knowledge: and last of all may be considered the rich City of London, that seemed to rule over the Ocean, and arbitrate the Trade of the world, is now so much impoverished, that it dares not set ships to Sea for fear of being robbed; all which be∣ing confessed, we may very well conceive some di∣vine anger and revenge hath caused this sudden change, especially the issue being not yet deter∣mined.
But if these representations be not of sufficient force to move our considerations in a conveni∣ent sense of our own danger, and by consequence to stir us up to some moderation in our courses, yet let us see whether there be left any spark of religi∣ous hónour in our dispositions; so far as to be per∣swaded by the extraordinary love of Almighty God alwayes shewed to mankinde from his first Creation to more goodness, since it may be suppo∣sed no reasonable creature can be so unworthy, as not by way of humane gratitude, to be willing to repay some requital for benefits received: at least∣wise to expresse desires of acknowledgement, though we may want an absolute power to do what we would in regard of our own frailty: and the ra∣ther do I use these just perswasions, for that it shall appear by the following Discourse, that God Al∣mighty hath taken more care in the preservation and salvation of mankinde, then in conserving the very Angels in heaven. Considerations of gratitude in regard of Gods goodness and love shewed to man-kinde. CErtainly, however we must confess, that those Spirits were created to enjoy a perpetual and a most sublime blessedness, yet were they not the ordained in so certain a condition of continu∣ance, but that they were subject to fall, as after∣wards multitudes of them did, and the rest were
constrained to confirm their establishment by a most sharp encounter with Lucifer, and his ateendants, over whom at last they got a most glorious and hea∣venly victory, through the constancy of their wills to serve their Lord and Creator by an intire spi∣ritual obedience. Wherein as I may say, Gods justice appeared something severe to their adversa∣ries, if we reflect but upon the extraordinary mer∣cies shewed unto our selves upon all occasions: for that he imposed upon the fallen Angels an eternal condemnation and punishment without revocati∣on or hope of redemption by the observation of any new injunction: whereas he did not alone at the first make man with an intention to bestow up∣on him that happiness which they had lost, but im∣plyed an infinity of love and care to preserve him still in the same capacity: for when he had placed him in that delitious Garden with an absolute pow∣er and free-will to do good or evil, which was plen∣tifully furnished with all the ornaments of nature, for the commodity of his being and subsistence, he onely imposed upon him one single Commandment no way seeming difficult to be observed: and not∣withstanding he soon broke this easie precept by the peevish frailty of his nature that overcame his Grace; yet God Almighty neverthelesse, was so far from not having compassion of his person, and taking commiseration of his offence, that immedi∣ately he promised him Redemption by the death of his Son; as also the more to honour the con∣temptible substance of his Creation, being nothing but earth, he obliged our blessed Saviour to take
upon him the very cloathing of our flesh and blood, because all man might also be capable of a perfect felicity, and enjoy a priviledge and Prerogative be∣yond all the Quires of Angels in Heaven: Who not onely stood most stupendiously amazed at the favour bestowed upon mankinde, but the very De∣vils themselvs, that then were also Angels, foreseeing the mystery in regard of the excellency of their knowledg, became perpetually damned, onely for endeavouring to resist Gods will and pleasure in that intention: which exprest above so much be∣yond all humane apprehension, that the considera∣tion of it onely is able to confound all our actions, and astonish our thoughts to the day of judgement, if this dull sensuality of our natures did not so much intangle our senses, with worldly concern∣ments, that the cleer faculties of our Soul, cannot operate at all nobly to our advantage. And yet further to shew the continuance of God Almigh∣ties affection towards man; although his just wrath had chased Adam out of Paradise, as from a place onely intended for his innocency, yet he did not presently commit his person to some dark and hor∣rid prison, there to be deservedly punished accor∣ding to the nature of his offence, for the breach of his former injunction, in part of satisfaction until his Salvation could be effected, by the Passion and death of his dear and onely Son, as his Mercy had determined; but put him into a world created with all manner of convenient varieties, for his neces∣sary recreations, though to be injoyned with labour and pains to keep down the stubborn rebellions of
his flesh; and in the interim comforted him with continual hopes of his speedy Redemption with many promises, to make his posterity by Grace a most glorious Nation above others, until more par∣ticularly Abraham setled both a Church and people in his own family: so that Iacob his grand-childe ha∣ving many sons, from whence proceeded the twelve Tribes, though they were by accident brought into Egypt, where they were forced to confess their sin a∣gainst their brother Ioseph, for which fact, as it may be supposed, their posterity were detained captives for some hundred of yeers, to shew that God had not altogether forgot the offence: yet being after∣wards released, by the religious and painful conduct of that great and good Captain Moses, whom God Almighty had specially chosen to put an end to his peoples miseries, he established them as a particular Nation of his own, whereby to be worshipped with some form and order, from whence his own Son al∣so and their Messias was to come in the flesh; not∣withstanding they never left murmuring in their journey, not onely against their Commanders, but even at God himself, which shewed, they carryed still with them the former corruptions of nature, and ingratitude with augmentation: however, he neverthelesse bare with their peevish disobedience, until he brought their posterity into that Land pro∣mised to Abraham & his Seed, as if his whole thoughts had been imployed onely in their consideration, since the like rebellious proceeding from such mul∣titudes of preservations could not probably be ima∣gined, to have almost come from the damned them∣selves.
And there as I say being arrived, he never left their protection, until they had absolutely sub∣dued all their enemies to their mercy, they posses∣sing in the interim their Territories, with so many signal victories, that those parts of the world began to be terrifyed with their fame: insomuch, as at last becoming so prosperous in their peace and tranquillity, that needs they would have a King to govern them, according to the custom of other Na∣tions: Which also being granted them by God Al∣mighty, he gave them one amongst the rest, the most glorious and wisest Prince that then lived upon earth, according to the relation of his greatnesse and wisdom, particularized in holy Scripture: who was not onely visited and courted by forraign pow∣ers at a very great distance, but built also such a Temple for the Jewes seruice by the presence and assistance of other Kings, as an additional honour to his own extraordinary riches and splendour, that the like Fabrick was not again to be seen in the whole world: and thus they continued their reign and glory, until Solomons Idolatry and their own sins divided the kingdom into two parts, by which means they suffered many captivities; however their gracious God never totally forsook them, still interviewing their chastisements with multitudes of consolations by holy Prophets and other Reve∣lations concerning his pleasure and their own Sal∣vation: sometimes sending them home to build up again their Temple, and other while scourging them for their wickednesse; intermixing, alwayes blessings with punishments, as if his own glory had
chiefly consisted in their good, until at last finding their stubbornness was incorrigible by ordinary means, he sent amongst them his own Son our most dear Saviour, not onely to redeem all mankinde, but to teach them new Lawes both of Morality and Divinity; but they now being come to the utter∣most period of all wickedness and ingratitude, were so far from entertaining this sweet guest with love and wisdom, that they handled him with so much cruelty, that if all the barbarous Tyrants in the world, had been assembled together in Councel, to have performed acts of inhumanity, they could not have invented more transcendent cruelties against innocency: so that we may say even God Almighty, was forced to cast these people out of his favour, who were not to be reformed by any means he could use; however, because he would not yet forget man, whom he had bought with the precious pawn of his own blood, according to his gracious as∣surance given to Adam after he had chased him out of Paradise, he chose to himself a new Church of the Gentiles, not in one place, but dispersed over the face the earth, to render his goodnesse more general, though much against his will by reason of those promises he had made to Abraham concerning his paticular Seed, which is most plainly verified in those sayings of holy Scripture, where it is affirmed, that often he would have gathered them together, as a hen inviteth her chickens under her wings and protection, but they would not: But to come yet more neer to our apprehensions, if not to pro∣cure in our souls both love and amazement, let us
but consider in particular what our Saviour Christ personally suffered for man kinde; which certain∣ly he might have forborn, if it had not been in re∣gard of his unmeasurable and infinite goodnesse, since our salvation cannot any way benefit his ma∣jesty, or increase his honour; wherefore it was meerly for our sakes, that he hath been willing to do these wonderful things, to prevent our perpetu∣al damnation, which his divine justice must other∣wise have inflicted necessarily upon our unhappy persons: by which considerations let us unpartial∣ly weigh, what gratitude we owe such a Re∣deemer, especially when we are to receive the one∣ly good by it our selves. Christs particular persecution. TO this purpose we may begin, first with the persecution of his very infancy, by that bloo∣dy and proud Tyrant Herod, to preserve with great∣er security (as he thought) that kingdom which he had unjustly usurped by the Romans power from anothers right; notwithstanding his own Consci∣ence told him (by the inquiry he made of the wise men, and the resolution of the Doctors thereupon) that he was the true Messias long expected: which not onely caused his most long and tedious journey into Egypt with his mother, not sufficiently provi∣ded, as it may be believed, of convenient necessaries, but was a cause after their return that he was con∣strained
a long season to obscure himself to prevent the like danger, having heard of the murther of so many children, in regard, Herods son then reigned in his fathers place: wherein (as it may be supposed) Jesus onely took upon him the ordinary helps of humanity, since it was not needful to make use of the demonstrates of his divine power towards the conversion of those people whom he came in the flesh to save: in which affliction it may be imagined, or rather considered, that he not onely underwent the sufferings of the body, but in some sort the passions of the minde belonging to man, and so consequent∣ly was grieved at exteriour accidents, with the rest of his friends, living in this poor, contemptible and needy manner about thirty yeers together; all that while performing such ordinary labours as belonged to the meannesse of that condition, which for our sakes he was pleased to enter into, whereby the better to conceale or shade the bright rayes of his Divinity from humane eyes, until the time should come for the declaration of his glory: but at last being called by the secret decrees of his Almighty father to preach to the Jewes, he continued at least three yeers, doing such stupendious miracles, and shewing forth such acts of austerity and penance, as were able almost to convert the Divels to good∣nesse: however, his own people were so far from hearing and believing him, that instead of follow∣ing his Doctrine, and obeying his jurisdiction, that they brought him to a most shameful condemnation before a heathen Judge, with all the spight, malice, and ingratitude could be imagined; in the cir∣cumstances
of which persecution, may be consider∣ed these particulars following. More particu∣lars of Christs persecution and sufferings.First, That he was betrayed by no other, then one of his own chosen Disciples, with whose losse he could not be but extreamly grieved in his thoughts: by whom, as I say, he was delivered into the cruel hands of his worst enemies, though until then esteemed his onely people; and in whose com∣pany he had conversed for some yeers, with all the sweetness of behaviour could be practised, in the interim performing so many acts of charity, both by his miraculous cures and continual instructions, that it might have taught a new humanity to al the mon∣sters upon earth, if they had been capable of reason; but these wretches, notwithstanding, brought him before Pilate, fast bound by strong cords, with such derision and scorn, as almost could not be exam∣pled, where they accused him with so much vio∣lence, that the Pagan himself was constrained in regard of their preposterous importunity, finding him altogether guiltless, furiously to scourge him before their faces, with an intention onely to save his innocency from death, thinking these torments, would have procured some compassion in their sto∣ny hearts: however, they persisting still in their de∣vilish malice against his person, for no other cause, as I say, but that he had preached against their lux∣uries and pride, cryed out violently to the Judge, that unless he crucified him for making himself a King, contrary to the Lawes, he could be no friend to Caesar, which words of theirs so terrified the un∣just and fearful President, that he delivered Barra∣bas
a most notorious malefactor, and sent our Savi∣our with a company of barbarous souldiers, wear∣ing a Crown of sharp Thorns upon his sacred head, to the common place of execution; as also bear∣ing his own Cross upon his bloody shoulders, for his greater contempt and indignity, where at last being arrived with many a weary and painful step, he was fastned with rough nayles to that Tree, that was ordained, though for his torment, yet for our comfort, and being after a time lifted up into the ayre between two thieves, excessively heated by his intollerable sufferings, he called for some∣thing to allay the outragiousness of his thirst: but their unexampled and most cruel inhumanity, could afford him no sweeter a mixture, but Vinegar and Gall, to give him any refreshment, as the uttermost and last period of all their wickedness and ingrati∣tude: which several torments certainly being put together by our consideration, cannot be thought but to exceed the affliction, of all the people that e∣ver suffered persecution: for as he was more pure and perfect in his constitution then other creatures, so by consequence must it be thought, those pains he endured were sharper and livelier tasted by his sen∣ses, in regard of the excellency of his making, then by other men, since obstructions as we know in the Organs & vital parts cause sometimes a kind of stu∣pefaction or insensibility in the flesh & apprehension, which he was not subject unto either by nature or accident: besides we may ad, that as he was free from all the passions of vain glory or any manner of hope of future reward for his sufferings, being both God
and man, so could he not be eased in his torments by those hopes which do use oftentimes to abate much of the torture in other people; and on the o∣ther side his grief was increased all the time of his life by his omnipotent foresight, knowing before hand that he should not onely die in the general, but also what particular cruelies he was to endure, so that as I say, his imagination was alwayes full of such grievous considerations, both in regard of him∣self that was personally to suffer them, as also out of a dear compassion to his most beloved mother, that he knew would be present at his passion, mournfully accompanyed with his Disciples and the rest of his kindred and friends. Secondly, If we further reflect upon the parties that used him in this manner,Other conside∣rations con∣cerning his sufferings. and the principal oc∣casion of their malice, we shall finde ever causes still for the augmentation of his afflictions in many other particulars. And to this purpose we must consider, that those who were his chief persecutors,The circum∣stances of his sufferings. were his own par∣ticular people, chosen above all other Nations in the world by himself to be cherished and loved, and from whom in the flesh he was naturally descended, so that it was no other then their own blood into his veynes, which they sought most lavishly and mali∣ciously to spill, upon no other reason, but that in a sweet and mild way of conversation, accompanied with miracles and benefits, he laboured to perswade them to their own salvation, that the Gentiles might not bereave them of their ancient inheritance, pos∣sessing themselves of those places in Heaven that
he wished them before others. Next what a Cor∣rasive was it to his gentle heart and Divine soule, to see them make use of no other creature to betray his innocent person, but his own Disciple, instru∣cted with his domestick affairs and expences, which made him most bitterly to complain, that he that eat his bread, for a little money had both unnatu∣rally lifted up his hand against him, and had been won to undertake so great a treason, contrary to all the rules of friendship, duty, and fidelity, which al∣most no heathen would have performed, for any re∣ward could have been promised. Thirdly, after he had at his last Supper bequeathed unto his Apostles the pretious Legacie of his body and blood to remain ever amongst them as a most admirable token of his love, presently going into the Garden, to pray, and there being in an excessive agony at the remembrance of his approaching Pas∣sion, sufficiently demonstrated by those distilling drops of blood and sweat that plentifully fell up∣on the ground from his most blessed body, he could not obtain from his three chief Disciples, to watch one hour with him, notwithstanding his earnest en∣treaty, and the great gift he had a little before be∣stowed upon them, which cannot again but be thought extraordinary troubles to his already affli∣cted minde. Fourthly, when he was apprehended by the cruel souldiers with violence and fury, certainly it could not be but some present horrour to his confused i∣magination as he was man, to see himself suddenly left by all his friends, who fled fearfully away to pre∣vent
the like danger to their persons; however they should have rather chosen to have dyed with him, according to their several professions when he was yet safe amongst them. And most of all that his chief Apostle, upon whom he had conferred so high a dignity, and in whose special friendship it is to be supposed, he imposed trust and confidence, should not onely timerously amongst the rest leave him with his enemies; but most cowardly deny him be∣fore a few contemptible servants, with oathes and protestations, being so transported with the sense of his own danger, that he would not so much as own his Masters acquaintance, in that assembly, to his further disgrace, he being at the instant most disdainfully used by all the spectators, that were present at his examination before the high Priest: which may be added to the rest of his afflictions. The cruelty of his persecutors with his suffer∣ings as well in minde as in body.Fiftly, we may remember that when he was brought before King Herod, who was inflamed with an earnest desire to see him in regard of the general fame that was spread abroad of his wonders and miracles, and to this purpose had an intention no doubt to have honoured his person; of the contra∣ry to be sent back again from his presence, with all the scorn and contempt in the world, cloathed in a white garment, either like a mad man, or a fool, which opinion the rude and barbarous souldiers prosecuted in so violent a manner, that it was one of the chiefest causes of his being crowned with Thornes, whereby in derision they might the more properly salute him as a mock King of the Jewes; putting in the interim a contemptible Reed in his
hand in lieu of a Scepter, with other ornaments of spight and disgrace over his blessed shoulders; which instruments also they made subjects for the further augmentation of his torments, in striking him often with the Reeds upon his already woun∣ded head, that the sharp and pricking Thorns might make the greater impressions, whereby the more to increase his anguish and pain. And last of all, we may call to minde, that when he was upon the Cross ready to yield up the Ghost, he most sorrowfully be∣held his ever dear beloved and honoured mother, who never could finde in her heart to leave him in all his miseries, though those cruel spectacles abun∣dantly augmented her inward afflictions, with eyes of no small compassion and grief standing neer him, with heavy looks and most desperate passions, be∣wailing her own losse and his suffering, neither be∣ing in a condition to assist one another, but by con∣doling language and perplexed soules, since our Sa∣viour would not make any use at all of the prero∣gative of his Divinity, to moderate the sufferings of his humanity: for as man had offended the Ma∣jesty of his father, that great God could not be sa∣tisfied without an extraordinary pacification: All which, I say, may put a full period to every conside∣ration that can possibly be imagined by any mor∣tal apprehension; wherein I must confesse, I do not more wonder at his goodnesse, then at his enemies cruelties and his friends forgetfulnesse, wherein would be increased my admiration, if our hearts should not be touched with something more then ordinary gratitude, and the rather for that we our
are to receive the onely benefit of this due and needful consideration. For let any man take apart these infinite sufferings, setting aside the mul∣titudes of his other mercies, and but indifferently weigh the natures of them in every particular cir∣cumstance, and I dare be bold to say, all the stories in the world cannot paint forth the like examples of cruelty, indignation and spight, either done to, or endured by what Martyrs or wicked persons soever; much lesse should it be thought after the believing of these passions, that we were created for nothing but to be delighted with ease, quiet, and all the sen∣sual pleasures; our roving and wild fancies can in∣vent or covet: but that we may not be without all humane testimonies to confirm God Almighties ex∣pectation concerning our duties in suffering, though I intend not to make any comparison: I shall in∣stance the examples, of some few of his good ser∣vants, who as it should seem, held it necessary upon occasions offered, to sacrifice all they had to his blessed will and pleasure. The Vertues of Abraham. VVE shall first speak of Abraham, who was, as I may say, the miraculous father of all the Jewish Nation, a man exercising so many ver∣tues, that it is a question, whether his piety, valour, humility, obedience, faith, or good nature most
exceeded: for after that by God Almighties special command he had quitted his native Country, and all his friends and acquaintance, but his Nephew, Lot, whom he brought along with him in his Pilgri∣mage, amongst strangers and barbarous people, when both their flocks increased so exceedingly, that they could not possibly longer live together by reason of the dayly contention of their herdsmen, Abraham bad his Nephew chuse the best part of the Country for himself; and by that means Lot inha∣bited in the Towns, whereas his Uncle still kept the fields, dwelling onely in Tents, wherein appeared both love and humility. Again, when he had heard that Lot unfortunately was taken prisoner, with al his substance, he presently with a world of courage and resolution, armed all his domestick servants for his speedy rescue, and fighting with his enemies, he delivered his Nephew, and made all his oppo∣sers with their wealth captives to his mercy; how∣ever, after this conquest he was so far from enrich∣ing himself by the spoyls, or being elated by the victory, that he not onely returned the goods back again to the owners, but with a great deal of humi∣lity presented the tenth part of his own to Melchi∣zedeck the Priest, as a testimony of his obedience and gratitude to God Almighty; to whose honour also in every place where he came, he built Altars, circumcising himself and all his family, according to his commandment. But now growing old, and finding he was not like to have any posterity by his wife, he was induced by her importunity to take her handmaid into his bed, by whom he had issue:
neverthelesse, when it was the will of God to make him the happy father of his legitimate son Isaac, in whom all Nations were to be blest, he drove both Hagar and her son absolutely out of his Dominions and protection; which however, as it may be be∣lieved, strook the old man to the heart with a most passionate grief, yet he was so far from being disobe∣dient, that he resolved with a ready willingnesse ra∣ther to endure any discontent inwardly, then out∣wardly to displease his wife, whom he knew had re∣ceived a particular blessing from God. And now we must come to the grand master-piece both of his faith and resignation, when God Almighty enjoyn∣ed him to Sacrifice the life of his onely son and heir, both spiritually and temporally: the first, in that he was promised to be made the father of the people of the Jewes; and the other, for that Abraham had no more issue to inherit his worldly substance: here it will be convenient to reflect upon his many suppo∣sed humane passions, in the prosecution of this action; however as it appeared he overcame them all by his ready obedience and abundant confidence in God, in regard of his extraordinary desire to ful∣fil his will and pleasure in every thing; first there∣fore, it may be believed, that he could not but ap∣prehend greatly the horrid and amazed discontents he should give his wife, whom he was alwayes so willing to please, when the first report should be made unto her, not onely of the death of her sole childe, in whose promising towardlinesse, she recei∣ved dayly so much comfort, besides her divine assu∣rance, of his hopeful prosperity, but to consider
him slaughtered by the cruel hands of his own fa∣ther, for no known cause could be imagined. Next, what a perplexity was there amongst his own thoughts, sometimes perhaps a little staggering in the right understanding of Gods promises, when he supposed it was unpossible for him to have any more children by reason of her extraordinary age, and so by consequence had little hope left him of peopling of Nations out of his loynes, much less to propagate the Church of God by his issue; which until then he never doubted. Thirdly, may be ima∣gined the natural and divine strife that was within his bosome, by reason of the passions of love, pit∣ty, faith, confidence, obedience, and improbability, joyned also with worldly interests, of which he could not chuse out of humanity but be sensible: and yet notwithstanding all these furious torments and combustions in his minde, this great and most con∣fident servant of God (as it is related in holy Scrip∣ture) went on to this strange Sacrifice, with a quiet and gentle demeanour, talking with his innocent son, to the place designed for his execution, where after some circumstances, and as it may be thought other discourses of patience and consolation, be∣ing ready to lift up his fatal, though pious, hand for the slaughter, he was suddainly hindred by the ad∣ministration of an Angel from Heaven, that not onely gladded his heart, but approved his faith by the shewing him another acceptable Sacrifice, ready prepared for the offering. And last of all, to make a full period of his glorious and most pious life, being prepared to rest his bones in his wives Sepulcher,
constrained thereunto by the extremity of age, he called his trusty servant unto him, and there taking his oath between his thighes, conjured him, never to take a wife for his son, but from his own kindred, however he might have advanced his fortunes with huge sums of mony, as it may be supposed in the place where he then remained, in the Land of stran∣gers, by reason of the general fame he had personally purchased in their Country; however, as I say, this good man chose rather to send the hope of his house far from home, with the losse of all his worldly sub∣stance, then that he should be in danger to mixe with the Gentiles, or contract marriage amongst un∣circumcised people: all which testimonies evident∣ly shew, how much Abraham preferred the service of his Creator, before all other considerations; besides, it is to be noted in his whole life, he never ended or begun any of his important actions, as is recorded for the most part in holy Scripture, but either with Thanks, Prayers, Obediences, or other pious devo∣tions performed to his great and omnipotent Crea∣tor, who remains certainly still the same God in Heaven and earth, and therefore cannot but expect the like duty from our actions and endeavours, though our corrupt manners, and most slow inten∣tions, seem at present to put a difference between our own condition and this holy mans.
The Patience and sufferings of Job. NOw that we have in some sort past over the perfections of Abraham; for it is unpossible by humane art sufficiently to describe his excellency, we must remember Iob, the true Patient, as I may say, of God Almightie since he gave the devil full power to try his goodnesse, by the very force of all his malice. Tis true, we cannot well know his ex∣traction, onely we are assured, he was a great Prince dwelling in the Land of Huz, abounding in every worldly prosperity; however, none of those en∣tisements could any way withdraw his heart from the service and love of his Creator: For notwith∣standing his sons and daughters continually feasted with delight and satisfaction, yet in the interim, he offered Sacrifice, and made Prayers, that his chil∣dren might not commit sin in their jovialty, until his goodnesse not onely flew up with swift wings before his Maker into Heaven: but his perfections became objects of envy, as I said before, to Hell it¦self, in so much as God Almighty was induced for the further demonstration of his own glory, by rea∣son of the devils insolent challenge to heap all earthly afflictions upon him, and to this purpose in one day received intelligence of the losse of all he possest, with the lamentable destruction and death of his numerous children; yet these afflictions on∣ly
procured this mild reply from his sad apprehen∣sion, that as God had given him the use of abun∣dance, so might he again dispose of them as he plea∣sed; for not coming into the world, as he said, with any thing, he could not expect to go out of it other∣wise then naked. But in this patience was not a∣lone shewed his confidence and humility: for being struck with a most loathsome leprosie all over his body, which forced him for something his better ease to sit upon a base and vile dunghil, where he was upbraided for his too much mildness and pati∣ence, by his insulting, though perhaps compassion∣ate wife, who bid him, Curse God and die, rather then endure such ignominy, shame, and sorrow, in falling from the estate and Dignity of a Prince to so low and miserable a condition: however, he made her no other answer then this, that she was a foolish wo∣man; for if good things they had received from Gods hands, why should they not also participate of bad if it were his will and pleasure? Until at last there came to his reproof as well as his consolation, his neerest and dearest friends, though at the first sight they knew not perfectly his person, by reason of his extraordinary change and deformity, which caused them for some time with pittiful eys to stand amazed without opening their mouths to speak one word according to their first intention: where∣upon the good man himself finding their perplexi∣ty, began to make a large discourse not onely of his own miseries, but Gods justice; wherein however he seemed to comon understandings, to have utter∣ed some speeches of too much passion, bitterly com∣plaining
of his Creators dealing with him, and in that particular perhaps over-justifying his own acti∣ons and innocency, yet were his words and discour∣ses all seasoned with such high mysteries, having such an absolute reference to Gods honour, that by the sequel of the story we finde, he erred not; but of the contrary, confounded all the Athiestical Ar∣guments of his friends, by his discourses, who in the end were compelled to beg his Prayers to God, for the pardon of their provocation. The Vertues of Moses. NExt we shal mention Moses, that great charitable and indefatigable Captain of God Almighties, who however he was preserved by Pharoahs daugh∣ter, and by that means adopted her son, and so con∣sequently as it may be believed, made the heir of most, if not all her wealth and substance, yet was he so far from forgetting the distressed condition of his miserable Country men, being in a manner con∣sumed with their hard labour of the Egyptian slave∣ry, that he not onely kept them daily company, whereby the better to honour them with his pre∣sence, but most passionately revenged their injuries upon all just occasions; insomuch, as to that pur∣pose, he slew an insolent enemy of theirs, with his own hands, to the provocation of Pharoah, and all his Court, for which fact he was forced to flie
from all his prosperity and dignity, into a strange Country, where he remained not onely a poor shep∣heard, but a most diligent servant to his surly father-in Law for a long season; defending in the mean time, with his personal valour the causes and rights of simple virgins, that wanted other assistance, un∣til God Almighty was pleased to call him to the de∣liverance of his people with strong conjurations, since his humility was unwilling to accept of so great an Office, professing himself to be rude of speech, and therefore not capable of such an im∣ployment: but being, as I say, both commanded, and strengthned by Gods Divine illumination, he went with a bold courage to the King of Aegypt, not∣withstanding those multitudes of pernitious Magi∣cians about his Throne, and resolutely demanded the Restoration of the Jewes; however, being de∣nyed his just, and charitable request by the proud Tyrant, after many miracles shewed in confirmati∣on of his absolute Commission from God Almighty, he invited and perswaded the people to follow him into a land of freedom, though their jelousies and feares, a long space resisted his intentions, to his no small vexation and grief, for whose safeties in prosecution of the intended journey and promised prosperity, he divided the Red-Sea, to make their passage. But neverthelesse this stubborn and per∣verse people, were so little grateful to him for his wise conduct and most painful endeavour, enduring now and then some penury in the Desarts, that they never forbore murmuring against his actions, as up∣braibing him, that for his own ambition, he had
brought them from the flesh pots of Egypt, to endure hunger and thirst in the wildernesse, which affronts and contumelies, he alwayes bore with so admira∣ble a patience, that instead of punishing them for their wild and preposterous disobedience, he com∣forted and incouraged them with mild language and good principles, praying to God upon all oc∣casions for their forgivenesse and prosperity; inso∣much, as his two hands were sometimes under∣propped by others, to strengthen them towards the continuance of his supplication, he being altoge∣ther weary and tired, by those devout exercises, which his heart willingly could never let him give over for his peoples benefit: and when their impi∣ous Idolatry and peevish impatiency, had notwith∣standing inflamed the wrath of God, against their wicked proceedings, insomuch as he seemed to put on an absolute resolution to destroy them; the chari∣ty of Moses was so great, and his love so intire to that ungrateful multitude, that desired God Almighty also, to blot him out of the book of life, that he might perish together with his Country-men, if he would not be pleased to change his determination: O admirable constancy and goodnesse! beyond the capacity of humane nature to apprehend; and the rather for that it may be conceived, the chief cause of his affection had reference to Gods honour, in that he supposed those people were ordained, to e∣stablish his more real and formal worship in the Land of Promise. Again, if we look at his unwearied justice from morning till night in hearing Law suits between party and party, we shall finde such an un∣paralell'd
fortitude as cannot be imagined, wherein notwithstanding his humility was so great, that he submitted himself to the Counsel of his Father in Law a plain man, who told him he did unwisely, to over burthen his strength and ability, with multi∣tudes of intricated businesses; and to that purpose wished him to chuse able and inferiour judges, to take off from his care some part of the trouble con∣cerning those causes depending before him, refer∣ring the most weightiest onely to his own judge∣ment, and censure; whereas until then he sat alone upon the Tribunal, both for morality belonging to his subjects more civil conversation towards the Go∣vernment of their persons and goods, and also to judge those more divine things, that belonged particularly to the service of Almighty God, accor∣ding to those Revelations, and precepts he had im∣mediately received from Heaven, whose infallible Oracle he seemed dayly to consult, and with such a wonderful fervour and diligence, that as he never attempted matter of consequence, without seek∣ing and knowing first the will & pleasure of God, so did he never return from those extraordinary exta∣sies, but with fear horrour and trembling both to himself and people. But as I shall not need, here to number more of his excellencies, since they are so largely recorded in holy Scripture; so may it al∣so be considered, that most of those admirable books were written by his own hand, that treated of the Jewes actions in the beginning, for example, to the stupid world, to learn what they ought to do accor∣ding to their capacities in endeavouring the service
of God from the bottom of their hearts; since cer∣tainly he cannot be pleased with lukewarm affecti∣on, much lesse for people onely to comply with their own affections, as if for no other end they had been created, specially when his best servants could not, by what hath been said, expect that priviledge and liberty. The wonderful magnanimity of Jephthe and his daughter. BUt now we will come to Iephthe that valiant righteous and just judge of Almighty God in Israel, whose story in short is onely thus: He was a bastard born, though highly legitimated by grace and the favour of his Creator; for although he was cast out from having any share amongst his brethren in his fathers possessions, which made him for a while enter into the company of thieves for his sub∣sistence, yet being presently for his personal valour chosen their Prince and Governour, he managed his Authority with so much successe, tending to the ser∣vice of God and his Country, that when Israel was fal∣len into most desperate necessity by the prevailing power of their inveterate enemies, he not only freed them from those dangers by his own courage and his subjects assistance, but afterward when he was Judge of the Country, recovered them by his many vi∣ctories, their Ancient honour; however, as it is
written, one time amongst the rest returning with extraordinary joy and Triumph to his own house, having won a most signal battail against the Ammo∣nites, after he had pleaded with them the right and justice of his Countries cause, wherein they would not be satisfied, he vowed in gratitude to God Al∣mighty to sacrifice the first thing he should encoun∣ter: which proved unfortunately to be his onely daughter, a young and most beautiful virgin, having no more children in all the world, who out of duty and gladnesse came out with hast before others to salute her victorious father: by which means, sud∣denly these Triumphs were turned into mourn∣ings, for presently Iephthe tore his garments instead of more joyful congratulations, beginning to re∣pent himself of his over rash vow, since either as he thought, he must displease God, or absolutely confound all his felicity and hopes in destroying of her that was deerer to him, then every earthly hap∣pinesse. But the pious Virgin perceiving her fa∣thers perplexity by reason of his Oath, onely with a lovely and obedient countenance told him, since he had sworn to God, it was most convenient he should perform his vow; and therefore wished him, that the consideration of her life might neither hin∣der his intention, nor trouble his thoughts; and withal desired two months time, accompanied with other Virgins of her acquaintance to go privately into the mountains, there the better to bewail her virginity; it being the custome of the Jewes so to do by reason of their expectance of the Messias, which being accordingly performed, she returned
into the City, and her sad father in prosecution of his promise and resolution, acted this unwilling and lamentable part, both to the grief and astonishment of all Israel. Now having related this story, I shal wish any man but to consider, how it was possible to ex∣presse a more higher zeal towards the service of God, in Iephthe himself, or a more sweet & comfortable o∣bedience expressed by his noble & religious daugh∣ter; wherefore we must conclude, that although there be made some doubt, concerning the lawfulnesse of the fact in this just and magnanimous person, in re∣gard of the rashnesse of his vow, which however proceeded from the extraordinary gratitude he de∣sired to shew towards Almighty God, for those fa∣vours he had received by his divine assistance; and especially for that most signal victory, granted him against the Ammonites, who were cruel and spightful enemies to his Country and Religion: yet he decla∣red thereby without all question, a most constant and firm resolution to be ingraffed in his pious soul, not to forbear, if there were occasion, the exact per∣formance of God Almighties service in every thing, according to his best skill and knowledge, although he might lose thereby never so many worldly ho∣nours, pleasures, preferments, or what hopes or comfort could possible delight nature, or destroy sadness in his condition. As appeared by this act of rigid conformity, according to the vow he had made after his victory; which in my opinion are most lively examples to instruct our endeavours, at leastwise, not to be too passionate in our own con∣cernments, when they may any way indanger our love to God.
The extraordinary goodness of King David. ANd now we must fall to consider the actions of David, that great and good King of Israel; who however he fell into some grievous sins by reason of humane frailty, yet he kept his heart still right in the pure sight of his omnipotent Creator, as appeared, not onely by his extraordinary pennances, mortifi∣cations and continual complaints declared in his prophetical writings, but by the very testimonies of God himself, who approved him to be a man according to his own heart; so that boldly we may affirm his perfections, which in this manner we shall particularize. First, we may reflect upon his constant valour al∣wayes shewed against the enemies of his Religion and Country, as well in the death of Goliath that fu∣rious and blasphemous Gyant, as in the multitude of victories gotten against the wicked Philistins, and other tyrannical Nations, wherein the true service and worship of God was the onely object of his thoughts, as appeared by his bringing home again the Ark with such joy and gladnesse, that he was e∣ven derided and contemned by his own wife, for those publique expressions, for that his gestures seemed ridiculous to her eyes and apprehension, being performed in the person of a King. Next, we may remember not onely his wonder∣ful
goodnesse towards his Lord and Master Saul, though with an envious malice he most wickedly prosecuted his life, but the extraordinary love and reverence he shewed to his person when he had him twice in his power, onely blaming his own pre∣sumption, for having cut off so much as one small piece of his garment, as a cleerer testimony of his intended fidelity. Again, when the news was brought him of his unfortunate death, as he conceived, with too much insultation by an officious messenger, al∣though by that accident he entred presently into the possession of the Kingdom, yet he punished the au∣thor of the intelligence for his too much want of duty, in rejoycing at the destruction of his King, be∣ing his natural subject; wherein, I must say, ap∣peared a double vertue, the one, in conquering his own affections, the other, in being just to his dead Master, though alwayes a bitter enemy to his sub∣sistence. Here also I must remember the constant affection he shewed to the posterity of Ionathan his friend; however, it may be supposed he never wan∣ted instigations of jealousie from others, that in time his race might aspire to the Crown in the right of their father, and when this proved real in his own son Absolon, who not onely most trayterously rebelled against all the rules of duty, good nature, and gratitude, but most wickedly abused his bed in publik, to take off from the people the apprehension of all hopes of reconciliation. This pious and indul∣gent Prince, was so far from revenge in his nature, especially against his own flesh and blood, that he most grievously complained at the newes of Abso∣lons
death, wishing his own life had payed the ran∣some of his misfortune: where by the way, it may be also remembred, that after his quiet restauration to his kingdom, he would never suffer that man to be punished, that not onely in his adversity upbrai∣ded him with most spightful language, calling him dog and the like, but maliciously flung stones at his person, in testimony of his inveterate hatred con∣ceived against his condition; neither must be forgot∣ten the tendernesse of his affection he bore to all his children, yet still joyned with such a confidence in Gods mercies, and so much fear to displease or to of∣fend him, that when his child was sick, he continu∣ed in sadnesse and mourning for many dayes toge∣ther, alwayes hoping to obtain his recovery. But when he found it was Gods pleasure, he should die, and none almost durst bring him the newes, for fear of his further vexation, yet when he was told it by way of necessity, he presently rose up from the ground with a seeming joyful countenance, onely saying, Gods will be done; withal declaring by words that as long as the childe was living, he ho∣ped by his supplications to obtain Gods favour. But being dead, he found it was his pleasure to de∣prive him of the blessing; and therefore, might of∣fend more in too much afflicting himself: So called for water and meat according to the custom of o∣ther people: which certainly shewes that in all his actions, he intended alwayes to conform his will to the honour and glory of Almighty God, against what worldly appetites soever. Again, may we con∣sider, his extraordinary pious magnanimity, that
when water was brought him from the Well of Bethlehem, by those three valiant souldiers, that so manfully ventured their lives to quench the Kings thirst, he refused to drink of it; saying, he would not buy the satisfaction of his Senses at so dear a price, and so ordained it as a Sacrifice for Gods ser∣vice, notwithstanding at the present, he endured most excessive pain, by reason of his extraordinary drought: however, prophane Authors have men∣tioned some such examples in Alexander the great, and others, yet certainly this most vertuous Prince onely performed this act of magnanimity, out of the consideration of a religious end, and not indu∣ced thereunto, by any fancy of vain-glory whatso∣ever; which for the most part accompanyed all the actions of the heathens. Amongst the number of his heroical deeds and heavenly resolutions, may also be remembred this one, that when God Al∣mighty had resolved to chastise him for numbring the people, for that he seemed not sufficiently to re∣ly upon the power of Heaven, without joyning thereunto humane assistance and confidence in his thoughts; he chose that Plague that was most general because his own particular person might not seem freer from danger then the rest of the people; which shewed a most excellent indifferency and justice in his nature, against the ordinary affections of man, that use to carry us too violently to our own con∣cernments and particular interests; And was the more to be admired, in regard that God Almighty had chosen him from a poor shepheard to be a most great and glorious King, and so by consequence al∣lowed
him to enjoy what felicities could possibly be lawful in this world; as a testimony to other Nations, that he not onely intended him private fa∣vours, but also to honour his fame in strange Coun∣tries amongst the Gentiles, for the greater majesty of his own power; and yet I say, this good Prince had alwayes so much care to please God, and such a continual remembrance of his own condition, that as he declareth himself, his pennances were exceed∣ing great, and his afflictions in minde in a manner perpetual, insomuch, as according to his true wri∣tings, he washed by night his Couch with tears, and eat his bread by day mingled with ashes; professing himself to resemble a Sparrow solitary upon the house top, or a sad Pelican in the Desart. In fine, if we consi∣der those vast volums which he wrote of his own sorrowes, cares, and troubles in Spirit, though dark∣ly figuring therein, our Saviours Passion, Sufferings, and eternal kingdom, we may easily believe, he spent not much time in the pleasures and delights of this world; however, his youth, condition, and opportunities, were sufficient enticements to all earthly vanities; and onely his wisdome, temper and goodnesse, withheld him from those unnecessa∣ry and vain passions, which he knew entertained, would neither secure his own salvation, or satisfie Gods justice.
The constant Martyrdome of old Eleazer. NExt we will come to Eleazer, one of the chief of the Scribes, being fourscore and ten yeers old in the time of Antiochus, who was not onely ex∣cellently learned in holy Scriptures, but extraordi∣narily versed in all divine and humane knowledge, and in the cruel persecution of this wicked Tyrant against the Jewish Religion, suffered a most glorious Martyrdom, because he would not prejudice his profession, by any manner of seeming hypocrisie: for being apprehended and brought before the Judge, he absolutely denyed to obey that perem∣ptory command or Injunction of eating Swines-flesh; rather choosing to undergo the worst of tor∣ments, then to displease his God either by act or example; however, being loved and favoured by some of those bloody executioners, by reason of his age, Nobility, and commendable conversation, they promised him, that if in private he would but seem to comply with the Kings desire, they would bring him other lawful flesh to eat, instead of that which was so strictl y enjoyned by publique Edicts; and by that means if he would, he should not onely save his life, but obtain honour and reward; unto which motion he quickly replyed, that he would rather chuse to suffer death, since he held it not conveni∣ent
for a man of his age to dissemble, for a little time of a corruptible life, whereby many young people might come to be scandalized and deceived; for although at the present, I may said he, be delivered from the punishments of men, yet neither alive nor dead, shall I escape the hand of the Almighty, but in departing manfully out of this life, I shall ap∣pear worthy of my old age, and leave a constant ex∣ample to youth, if with a ready and stout minde I suffer an honest death for the most grave and most holy Law, which being said, he was forthwith drawn to execution, and they that led him (who had been before more milde and courteous) were turned in∣to wrath, by reason of those words he had uttered, which they thought proceeded out of arrogancy: so that when he was a killing with strokes, he groan∣ed and said, O Lord, who hath the holy knowledge, thou knowest manifestly, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I do sustain sore pains of the body, but according to the soul for thy fear, I do willingly suffer these things: This man certain∣ly in this manner departed this life, leaving not on∣ly to young men, but also to the whole Nation, the memory of his death for an example of vertue and fortitude. And thus have we the cleer relation of this glorious Martyrdome, drawn out of the second book of the Machabees; which in some sort may teach duty and resolution to all manner of conditi∣ons, since neither age nor honour can be privi∣ledged: much less ought any to give up their faith, or corrupt their manners, under what pretence soever, either of pleasure, or conveniency, those being no∣thing
else but the Divels golden bait, to draw peo∣ple to hell in luxurious Chariots; in testimony of which, we will relate one of the most remarkable Martyrdoms that ever was recorded either by di∣vine or prophane writer, since not onely Sexs, but very nature it self seemed to contend for a prero∣gative in the service of Almighty God, in despight of horrour and all the appetites of flesh, blood, af∣fection, and any other humane inclination or world∣ly satisfaction whatsoever, and with so high and re∣ligious a magnanimity, that my own thoughts I must confesse are confounded in the relation, with wonder and admiration: however, I know the same duty of suffering belongs to every person, if God be pleased to call such to the tryal; though of the otherside, I am again comforted and encouraged with these sayings, that he will at no time tempt any beyond his strength, and therefore we may be confi∣dent by his divine grace, we shall be able to do all things, though this grace cannot be procured un∣lesse our selves diligently comply with our best en∣deavours; which made one say, it was harder for God Almighty to save a soul, then to Create a new world; for man himself must concur in the one, and God alone could perfect the other by his om∣nipotency.
Strange sufferings of a woman and her seven sons. THere was as the Holy Scripture saith, seven bre∣thren with their mother apprehended by the commandment of King Antiochus to be compelled to eat Swines flesh, by whips, scourges, and other torments. But the first of them said, What seekest thou, or what wilt thou learn of us; we are ready to dye rather then to transgresse the lawes of God coming from our fathers; Wherewith the King being inraged, ap∣pointed frying pans and brazen pots to be heated, and the tongue of him that had spoken first, to be cut out, as also the skin of his head to be drawn of; with his hands and feet to be chopped off, the rest of his brethren and mother looking on. And now when he was made in all parts unprofitable, he commanded fire to be put to him; that breathing as yet he might be fryed in the frying-pan: wherein when he was long tormented, the rest together with their mother exhorted one another to die manfully, saying, Our Lord God wil behold the truth, & wil take plea∣sure in us, as Moses declared in the profession of the Canticle. The first therfore being dead, they brought the next to make him a mocking stock, where the skin of his head being also drawn off with the haires, they ask∣ed him if he would yet eat before he were punished through the whole body in every member. But he answered in his Country language, that he would not do it, so receiving the torments of the first, and
being at the last gasp said, Thou indeed a most wicked man in this present life destroys us: but the King of the world wll raise up those that dyed for his Laws in the resurrection of eternal life. After him the third is had in derisi∣on, and being demanded his tongue, he quickly put it forth, and constantly stretched out his hands say∣ing with confidence: [From God do I possesse these mem∣bers, but for the Lawes of God I do now contemn the same, because I hope I shall again receive them of him,] To the amazement both of the King and standers by, by by reason of the young mans courage, that seemed to esteem the torments as nothing; who being dead, the fourth they vexed in the same manner, with tormenting him, and now when he was also ready to die, he said, It is better for them that are put to death by men to expect hope of God, that they shall be rai∣sed up again by him, for to thee there shall not be Resurrecti∣on unto life: So bringing the fifth, they tormented him; but he looking upon the King said, Thou ha∣ving power amongst men, whereas thou art corruptible, do∣est what thou wilt, but think not that our stock is forsaken of God: wherefore do thou patiently abide, and thou shalt see his great power, in what sort he will torment thee and thy seed. After him they brought the sixth, who be∣ing ready to dye said thus, Be not deceived vainly, for we suffer this for our own sakes, sinning against our God, and things worthy of admiration are done in us: for that thou hast attempted to sight against God. But the Mo∣ther above measure marvellous and worthy of good mens memorie, which beholding her seven sons pe∣rishing in one dayes space, bare it with a good heart for the hope that she had in God, exhorting every
one in their Country, language manfully being re∣plenished with wisdom, and joyning a mans heart to a womans cogitation, she said unto them, I know not how you appeared in my womb, for neither did I give you Spirit, soule or life, and the members of every one I framed not: but indeed the Creator of the world, that hath formed the nativity of man, and that invented the Original of all, he will again restore with mercy unto you Spirit and life, as now you despise your selves for his Lawes. But Antiochus by these actions thinking himself con∣temned, and withal disdaining the voice of the up∣braider; when the youngest was yet alive, he did not onely exhort with words, but also withal affirmed, that he would make him rich and happy, and being turned from the Lawes of his fathers, he would account him a friend. But the young man be∣ing not inclined to these things, the king called the Mother and counselled her to deal with her son for the saving of his life; wherupon she promised him to advise her child; so bending towards him as mock∣ing the cruel Tyrant, she said thus in her Country language, My son have pitty of me that have born thee in my womb nine moneths, and gave thee milk for three yeers, nourishing thee and bringing thee to this age; I be∣seech thee my son look to heaven and earth, and all things that are in them; and understand that God of nothing made them and mankinde: So it shall come to passe, that thou wilt not fear this tormenter, but being made a worthy partaker with thy brethren, take thou death that I may a∣gain receive thee with them: When she was yet deliver∣ing these things, the yong man said, For whom stay you, I obey not the commandment of the King, but the ordinati∣on
of the Law which was given by Moses, But thou that art be∣come the inventer of al malice against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hand of God, though we for our sins do suffer those things: and if the Lord our God hath been angry with us a little for rebuke and correction, yet he will be reconciled again to his servants; But thou O wicked, and of all men most flagitious, be not idly extolled with vain hopes, for thou hast not escaped the judgements of Almighty God, who beholdeth all things: My Brethren having sustained short pains, are become under the Testament of eternal life: but thou by the judgement of Almighty God, shalt receive punishment for thy pride; And I also as my brethren, do yeeld my life and my body for the Lawes of our fathers, in∣vocating God to be propitious to our Nation quickly, and that thou with torments and stripes mayest confesse that he is onely God; but in me and my brethren shall the wrath of the Almighty cease, which hath justly been brought up∣on all our stock. Then the King incensed with anger raged against him more cruelly above all the rest, taking it grievously that he was mocked, so this al∣so dyed unspotted, wholly trusting in the Lord: where last of all, after the sons the Mother was con∣sumed, and thus ended these most glorious suffer∣ings, wherein may be considered these following particulars.Considerati∣ons upon these sufferings. That seven goodly young men, in the very flower of their age should with such courage and fortitude, not onely willingly deprive them∣selves of all worldly honour, meerly for the love of God, since the Tyrant offered them what prefer∣ments they could almost desire, quitting their Law, but to endure with such admirable constancy, the cruellest of torments personally, whilest in the in∣terim
their vettuous and most magnanimous Mo∣ther, with religious, though grieved eyes, stood by like a heavenly rock, to behold her children dis∣membred and torn in pieces by the violence of stripes, scourges, and other exquisite devised tor∣tures, never almost invented before by humane ma∣lice and subtility; wherein appeared not the least signe of wavering or vain-glory: But of the con∣trary, were so far from justifying either their acti∣ons, deservings, or sanctity, that they professed o∣penly, they suffered those punishments justly for their own sins; as they hoped in expiation of the general faults of the whole Nation of the Jews, and to that purpose comforted and confirmed each other with godly, pious, and valiant exhortations, full of comfortable assurances in the mercies and goodnesse of Almighty God, who would raise them up at the last day, to the comfort of themselves, and the absolute confounding of all his enemies; where also may be remembred the Pathetical, grave, and wise conjurations of their most brave and holy Mother, that however she did not know, how she had framed their members in her natural womb, yet she was assured, that their supernatural father, if they continued constant to the end, would again give them new spirit and life, to his honour, and their abundant felicity, not seeming at all to desire their comfort and conversation in this world, since that satisfaction could endure but a short time, but onely wished to possesse their companies in an eternal and heavenly mansion, where they might enjoy one another, for ever before the face of God,
by way of an infinite blessednesse, and to this pur∣pose, after she had joyfully beheld the last catastro∣phe of her sons constancy and most violent suffer∣ings, their dead bodies being exposed to her view, as bloody sacrifices of humane cruelty, she offered up her own life most couragiously to be consumed also by torments, as a full period to the Hecatomb, in confirmation of her own faith, and as a worthy ex∣ample for her Nation to all eternity; which heaven∣ly Tragedy, I hope, is more then a sufficient testi∣mony to shew, that these people could not have been drawn away contrary to their duties, by the fond and idle vanities of these times, that renders so many now carelesse either of belief or manners. Neither can we say these onely have given patterns to the world of their holy and admirable constancy, since the Primitive Church, after our Saviours passi∣on, hath produced some stories of the same nature, that were acted also by heroical persons of the fe∣male sexe. The wonderful life of Saint John the Baptist. LAst of all, we shall mention Saint Iohn the Bap∣tist, whose sins certainly could no way make him deservedly liable to those austerities he exerci∣sed upon himself, though it should seem God Al∣mighty neverthelesse thought it necessary, that the forerunner of his dear son, should make plain the
steps of his Saviours Passion, with wonderful exam∣ples of penance in his person, as a cleerer testimo∣ny that it is unpossible but by such means to please God, or at leastwise to have an absolute intention so to do, if the occasion be presented in this humane life; for we must be assured this world was not cre∣ated for a Paradise, but for our pilgrimage; neither did ever yet any person go to Heaven, but either through the fire of tribulation, or by the practice of mortification, exampled by Jesus Christ himself up∣on earth, and imitated by all the glorious Saints and Martyrs of his Church from the very first beginning of times, and must so continue unto the end of the world; however, lesse and more according to the blessed pleasure of Almighty God, who will have such testimonies from his servants, for more assured marks of their own interiour affection to himself, in regard of the benefits they have received from his eternal Majesty, not onely for their Creation, but preservation and Redemption. To which purpose as I say, we may consider the life of this great Pro∣phet, who as it should seem, notwithstanding his su∣pream priviledge of being the greatest, that was ever born of a woman, could not be exempted from the mortifications belonging to humane condition, which in his own person, he performed most rigo∣rously, not onely in debarring himself from all youthful delights, but in abstaining from his neces∣sary acquaintance that should have administred to his conveniency and subsistence: for as we reade, he went at seven yeers old into the Desart, where he could not have lived, but that he was supported,
and relieved by the special grace and assistance of Almighty God, beyond the ordinary course of na∣ture. Besides, he was onely cloathed in Camels haire, and fed upon Locusts and wild honey, nei∣ther drinking wine nor strong drink; which being in my opinion the highest expressions of a mortifi∣ed life, are sufficient examples to shew, that this ve∣ry course was ordained him from Heaven, to teach the world pregnant documents of voluntary affli∣ction, towards the fulfilling of that new Law, that was to be established shortly after by our Saviour: since neither his Senses nor his understanding seem∣ed to entertain any earthly satisfaction, according to the custom of other people; which manner of living notwithstanding he continued many yeers, wherin was spent and wasted the chief flower of his age, as being by a prophetical spirit (no doubt) fore∣told, before he came to any seeming or competent yeers of discretion, that it was not onely most neces∣sary, for his masters service, but absolutely agreeing with Gods will, that he should exercise the same Authority, which Jesus Christ determined both to teach and practice in his conversation a∣mongst men; and to this purpose our Saviour was never mentioned by holy Scripture to laugh in all the time of his being here, though frequently he shed teares for the sins and miseries of the world; most plain and evident testimonies, that at leastwise he expects from us a convenient suppression of all inordinate passions and appetites. Furthermore, when this great Saint came to the full period of that time for what he was designed, he not onely instru∣cted
the people without any manner of flattery or connivency, in those high mysteries belonging to his calling, but most earnestly preached still penance to their cares and considerations, as if nothing but a proportionable measure of that wholesom salve, was to be applyed. And did neverthelesse main∣tain his own profound humility in such an excel∣lent nature, that notwithstanding the largenesse of his Commission and dignity of his office, he would not be brought by all the admiration, and almost a∣doration of such persons as came to hear him in the wildernesse, to confesse any power or good belong∣ing to himself; though his words and actions seem∣ed to the vulgar and rude multitude most miracu∣lous, but alwayes referred the honour and praise to him which was to follow. And to that purpose sent his own Disciples to be instructed by our blessed Sa∣viour, whom also in the flesh he would not have baptized, meerly out of a trembling reverence at the deep consideration of his divine person, though he was onely sent into the world for that effect, if he had not been urged thereunto by an absolute neces∣sity, as fearing further to offend, by reason his o∣bedience might have been brought in question. And last of all may be considered, that whereas he might probably have received what honour he had plea∣sed from Herod, if he would any way have comply∣ed with his wifes unlawful ambition, and his own violent lust; yet he was so far from giving of any man∣ner of countenance to either, that he told the ince∣stuous King publiquely, with a most bold courage, and zealous intention, that he could not by the
Lawes of God keep his brothers wife. In prosecu∣tion of which admonition, he willingly laid down his life, for the exact maintenance of Religion and Justice. And thus ended that most glorious cham∣pion and Herald of Christ his happy dayes, to our example and benefit, if we concur also with the same supernatural Grace offered from Heaven, to suppresse inordinate passions and fleshly appetites; which onely keep the Soul from acting nobly ac∣cording to the intention of our Creation. The small satisfaction of earthly plea∣sures considered. NOw we have done with these holy men, we will a little fall upon the consideration of the small satisfaction or prerogative of earthly felici∣ties or ambitions, that appear so exceedingly to be∣witch our understanding, in so much as they seem to take from our very hearts all manner of effectual de∣sire to prosecute not onely this obligation of a no∣ble gratitude to God, but hinder us from procu∣ring the least security to our selves, contrary to the example of these godly people, mentioned in my Discourse; who certainly enjoyed the same facul∣ties of nature as we do, and therefore might have possest the like appetites of humanity, if Grace had not predominated. In demonstration of which
I am perswaded, nay I am assured, that if all the ex∣quisite Epicures in the world, and wisest Statesmen, were gathered together in one Councel, to consult and devise a way for a person to enjoy a perfection of happinesse upon earth, and a full power were gi∣ven to all his Senses in each faculty, to tast every de∣light of nature in the superlative degree, not being subject to any natural restriction, or could be inter∣rupted by accident, yet he would finde some defects in the possession, not answering his expectation; if not otherwhile a kinde of wearisomnesse in the ve∣ry fruition, by over much satiety; which apparant∣ly would be demonstrated by his coveting some∣thing else, which he supposed he had not, to the new perturbation of his unsatisfied minde. And this plainly shews, that mans true and perfect con∣tent, must be fixed in a higher Region then in this world, to afford his thoughts rest and quiet. Of the other side we see, ambition consists wholly upon the matter in nothing but expectation and opinion, since it is evident, we are more taken with hopes of honours to come, then absolutely satisfied with those that are present. As for example, what boy is there at School, that doth not heartily desire to be a man, though youth be esteemed the darling of nature, because he apprehends to want some∣thing of his perfection in his boyish estate? Again, what man is there, that is arrived to that period of yeers, that doth not as earnestly wish to be in his for∣mer condition? Apprehending the too fast com∣ing on of old age as a defect, which seems not one∣ly to be a vexation, but some horror to his thoughts
if he carry about with him nothing but humane considerations. Also if we reflect upon the many chances of mans life, we shall finde, that the pains and care we take to pamper our selves, and nourish our ambition, do more then weigh down the plea∣sures we can any way hope to obtain; for that all our delights are most commonly interrupted either by infirmities, or some other crosse accidents, use a∣ny industry we may to the contrary. Neither is there any person of what happy Calling or degree soever, but seems oftentimes even weary of his own time; insomuch, as when day comes, he wish∣eth for night, and in the night he longs passionately for day; and so from one posture to another, still hoping to enjoy new felicity, as if he had not yet tasted sufficiently towards the fruition of a per∣fect settlement; being carryed onely thereunto by his roving fancy and unsatisfied nature: which ar∣gues, that the very disposition of man cannot be made happy with this world, in what degree soe∣ver obtained. And to this purpose we see, new in∣ventions and delights must be sought hourely, or multitudes of divertisements of all kindes, the more insensibly to passe away the houres and dayes of our life, and yet nothing seems so terrible to our apprehensions, as to think our time should ever come to an end. So that we neither can be content to think of leaving this world in any manner, but of the contrary, hate all remembrance of it; and yet, in effect we do not take any real pleasure to possesse life. Wherefore, I must conclude with this principle; that since earthly concernments are but
at the best mortifications as we make them, how much better were it, and more agreeing with rea∣son, the contrary being no other then an impious madnesse, not to make use of such vexations (which will come upon us do what we can) towards the ob∣taining of such a happy state, as neither admits of defect or suffers termination. So that since it is ap∣parant, that our thoughts have no circle to walk in but that of Religion to finde out not onely divine security, but as I may say humane satisfaction, ac∣cording to the very words of the Holy Scripture, that bids us first seek the kingdom of God, and all other things shall be given unto us; it must needs be an intire lunacy, to involve our actions and desires in too many sensualities, and much more to nourish our pride and torment our thoughts, with inconve∣nient and violent ambitions, by ayming at that which in a manner nothing can arrive unto, but vain imaginations, whilst in the mean time we leave the essential point of our happinesse altogether unre∣garded. O madnesse of man-kinde! And yet we are so foolishly transported beyond all reason, with this violent desire of earthly satisfaction, that if at any time we enjoy but a smackering of worldly va∣nities, we become so passionate to make a further progresse therein, that we cannot rest day nor night without afflicting our mindes, as it were destroying in our selves those very comforts that God Almigh∣ty intends barely for humane consolation. How∣ever, I do not say this to take away absolutely from a man, the appetite of all conscionable and noble affections, for that were totally to overthrow honest
industry and lawful endeavours; seeing it is little lesse evil to do it, then ayme at nothing; especial∣ly for that we are not able alwayes, to employ our thoughts and actions intirely in the effecting of di∣vine things, or conversing inwardly with Angels; but my intentions hereby are, to have a body so to square and regulate his passions, by a discreet rule of moderation in all his desires and undertakings (con∣sidering what any can go about of worldly concern∣ments, are not onely in every respect subject to di∣versity of accidents, but in themselves never so wel obtained, not worth our chief consideration) as not to be confounded or overmuch distasted, either by needlesse vexation, if they may not be purchased, or to fall into too much desperation, being again lost after they are once had. And a great deal lesse ought we to be afflicted when such transitory things are taken away from our possession, by the immedi∣ate hand of Almighty God, who knows best what diet we need in the whole course of our frail life. For as we desire earthly acquisitions (especially su∣perfluities) more out of a vain opinion to be said or thought we have them in our power, then out of any real benefit we hope for, or enjoy by the posses∣sion; since for the most part our servants are parta∣kers with us alike, if not oftentimes in a greater measure in the sensual use of them; so of the other side, if we look onely upon the point of reputati∣on and estimation, in being thought to possesse much beyond the capacitie of other people, which as I said before depends meerly upon an airy opinion, we may have the same honour by letting them go
patiently, or losing them gallantly; and a great deal more if no personal fault by carelesse neglect, be laid deservedly to our charge, then if we should have possessed them to our selves and heires for ma∣ny lasting generations; witnesse the late King, who will be more glorious in after times (according to many mens judgements) for the extraordinary con∣quests his constancy and courage got over his op∣pressions, then if he had quietly and peaceably dy∣ed in his bed a natural way, after a long and flou∣rishing reign, possest of all his humane honours and Dominions. Truly the effect of vertue is of such a property, that it cannot be taken from us either by time or power; whereas riches and worldly pre∣ferments, are for the most part, more belonging to fortune and accident then to our selves. Never∣thelesse I say, this vertuous benefit cannot be obtai∣ned, without some absolute or signal victory pur∣chased over all base and earthly passions and affe∣ctions. And to shew how much God Almighty hath been ever pleased to honour, and in a manner to eternize in this world such endeavours, especial∣ly when grounded upon Religion and good inten∣tions; there have been many persons that onely have sought Caves and Desarts for their habitati∣ons, to avoid all kinde of remembrance, as divers holy Saints and Martyrs, who indured in their par∣ticulars, as much scorn, contempt, and neglect, as humane malice could invent, or their own humility desire; yet both their names and fame live now a∣mongst us with that eminency, as if their actions had been continually recorded (whilst they were
living) by multitudes of writers, according to the custom of the Meads and Persians; when as most of those great and glorious Kings (with many other Monarchs of latter times) I may confidently aver, have wanted Monuments, or at leastwise a true re∣lation of their actions, notwithstanding the onely Heaven they desired after their deaths was, to be continued fresh in the memory of posterity. So that we may boldly affirm, there is neither real fe∣licity or certain content to be hoped for in this world, depending upon any manner of sensuality or ambition, since all things desired without doubt are but either surfeits or opinion, although a man should every day in the yeer, be furnished with va∣rieties according to his own wishes, and each houre in the day, could gain strength and vigour to enjoy them; insomuch as it is unpossible a mans minde can be ever satisfied, without prescribing to him∣self a moderation in affections: which truly will not be had unlesse he place his thoughts chiefly up∣on the intention of his Creation; and by that means resolve to use the things of this life with temper, since as I must say often, they are onely given us for our recreation, and not for our Heaven: which determination and no other, will soon render all accidents, not onely conveniently indifferent and necessary to our present and future being, but even by such resolutions, accompanied with some pro∣portion of Grace, (not to be compassed but by this means) we shall be able to make extream advanta∣ges of crosses and misfortunes, that do what we can with all the endeavours and power of this
world, will still come upon us, and to our further vexations, if we prevent not the apprehension of such accidents by higher designes. In conclusion, whosoever can put himself in this happy conditi∣on, whereby he may be master of a discreet tem∣perance in all his actions, probably in a short time may finde out a passage to other vertues, until at last they bring him to that content, which he can never obtain by his inordinate passions; since the world will not afford what it was not made for. And therefore it may be esteemed a maxime of the wisest Philosophy to think, there is no happinesse so great in this life, as to be well able to disgest all unhappinesse. Whether or no when we have gained this victo∣ry, there must not be something to di∣rect us in Gods Worship, of an infallible nature. BUt now when we have gained this noble victo∣ry over our passions, though we may esteem the greatest part of our work effected, in regard that naturally flesh and blood are the chiefest obstacles against divine resolutions and self content; yet ne∣verthelesse, we may fail in the observations of those duties, belonging to the necessary worship of God, whereby our happinesse will come also to be de∣stroyed;
if we submit not our selves to som infal∣lible directions, which certainly can be no where found but in the Church of Christ, framed by his own hands, and ordained to be the Tribunal of the Conscience, placed here upon earth, not onely to in∣struct and chastice, but to afford us true consolati∣on. So that I suppose, it will not be altogether im∣pertinent, to discourse a little concerning the pro∣perties thereof, in that its jurisdiction and authori∣ty, seemeth to be the very Bases and foundation of all our belief. To this purpose it must be first con∣sidered, whether such an Assembly hath been esta∣blished or no. Certainly humane experience teach∣eth us, that there was never yet any Law given to a Nation or a people, but a Tribunal also was ordained to be a Judge of that Law, as well to inform the Sub∣jects concerning the doubts of the right interpretati∣on of the injunctions prescribed, as to determine the due execution of them, that people might neither pretend ignorance or use malice, without being in∣structed in the one, and punished for the other; much lesse may it be thought that God Almighty, who is wisdom and justice it self, would have impo∣sed observations of a mystical nature upon his esta∣blished subjects, without having instituted as well a way how they might be instructed in their igno∣rance, as corrected in their stubbornnesse: especial∣ly when the truth of those heavenly principles gi∣ven were impossible to be known to proceed from him, but by some ordinary information, agreeing with their capacities and understandings. For how∣ever in the beginning those Documents, might be
confirmed by miraculous inducements, to some few particularly instructed to that purpose, yet could they not well be continued to posterity, but by u∣sual wayes, since every person was not ordained to be a Prophet, or to talk with God face to face as Moses did, who gave our Ancestors the first metho∣dical rules, which ever since have been maintained amongst men by tradition from hand to hand. Neither is it likely that this omnipotent, and as I may say, most affectionate Providence, would have lesse care for the preservation of the unity of Re∣ligion with the Christians, that are a people gather∣ed and extracted from all the parts of the world, differing in tongues and kindred; and so by conse∣quence have more need of his assistance, then he had to conserve it in the twelve Tribes of Israel, that were a generation onely confined to one Country, and therefore could not so easily differ in points of Faith, or be corrupted in manners for want of due information; yet neverthelesse we see God Al∣mighty held it so necessary a thing with those few people, though united and circumscribed, as I say, into a most narrow and small circuit of ground and Territorie, that he had alwayes his Church and High Priest amongst them, unto whose Decrees our Saviour Christ himself commanded the Jewes to be obedient (however the men at that present that go∣verned were most corrupt and wicked) onely be∣cause they sat in Moses chair, and enjoyed of right a supernatural prerogative, by way of an orderly succession which he intended should onely conti∣nue until after his passion, that he might establish
his more lasting and holy Church, which by his own promise is to indure without interruption, until the end of the world, being invisibly to be alwayes go∣verned by the Holy Ghost, for the more assuredness of infallibility, which plainly shewes that such a thing must be upon earth; Whereunto are annex∣ed also these marks of power and perspicuity,Power and perspicuity al∣so annexed to the condition of this Assem∣bly, since it is said, he would not onely place his Tabernacle in the Son figuratively, meaning his Church, but we are admonished in holy Scripture from our Sa∣viours own mouth, that whosoever will not hear his Church shall be esteemed no better then a Hea∣then and a Publican; which truly would seem to any man a most impertinent saying, if there were no such Assembly upon earth to be heard and listened unto: For it is not to be supposed, we should upon all occasions mount into Heaven, either to be in∣structed in our doubts, or to give information a∣gainst our neighbour erring, so that of necessity, there must be some Congregation or Tribunal on earth established to that purpose; besides, by the very Articles of our Creed, we are to believe the Holy Catholick Church; which implies a certain∣ty of there being such a thing, before we can believe what it sayes. So that we may conclude it a most ridiculous madnesse, to think there is no visible and real place or Chair upon earth, where men may go to receive true and undoubted information con∣cerning matters of Religion; especially when it is not credible that every particular person should have sufficient direction by Revelation, since the greatest Prophets that were ever sent into the
world, were constrained to fetch their instructions oftentimes from others. In the next place it is as necessary to believe, that this established Assembly must be infallible,That this As¦sembly must also be infalli∣ble. as that it is at all; since if it should be otherwise, our di∣rections would sometimes misse, and so consequent∣ly we might ignorantly contract errours in our wayes and endeavours, instead of running surely in the direct path of Almighty Gods principles and commandments towards our future salvation: For it is evident by the rules of reason, upon all inten∣ded certainties, there ought to be some means pre∣scribed us, whereby we may be sure we are right. As for the purpose in all humane matters, we are ac∣customed, to use the benefit of weight, measure, or some other experience, before we have sufficient as∣surance any thing is just according to our intenti∣on: much more are we to believe, that our Saviour Jesus Christ, after having shewed such a mystical love in our redemption, would not have carelesly exposed us to a dark Labyrinth of confusion and in∣certainty concerning the knowledge of his Law, of such a consequence to be observed; nay, rather it is to be supposed, he would have written it in brasse for our better instruction, if he had not ordained an Assembly onely for that effect; but for a greater confirmation of our purpose, we may remember what the holy Scriptures tell us; that the Church is the pillar of Truth, and therefore consequently cannot be false; neither could Gods revealed will and pleasure in an ordinary way and without mira∣cle, come to be known to our humane understand∣ings,
but by the Records delivered unto us, by the unquestionable Authority of the Churches traditi∣on, that renders them Authentical to our belief, without which they have no seal of exemplificati∣on or testimony, since it is not enough to say, that one place of Scripture, is perfectly able to interpret another, without a more assured rule, when as we do not know by our own reading and particular Sci∣ence, what places are true Scripture and which not, having onely the letter of the book to look upon; and as little can we be assured that we do expound those writings right as they were intended; be∣cause it belongs not to any private spirit so to do: of the contrary, it may be feared according to the words of Saint Peter (especially if we use too much presumption) that being unlearned and unstable, we may wrest the Text to our own damnation. So that of necessity there must be something above our selves, not onely to be the interpreter of this Law, but also to tell and shew us the Law it self that was ordained, so that I must leave it to any common understanding to consider what can be more pro∣per for this then the Church of God, that he hath promised to be withal until the consummation of the world. We may also extract another assurance, out of the old Testament, which is that God Al∣mighty said, in time to come he would chuse such an Assembly by orderly succession, whose spirits as it is written should conserve knowledge, and the true Spirit should be put into their mouths, from generation to generation for ever. Wherefore I say, as this must needs be meant onely by the universal
Church, so of the other side, such persons cannot be but esteemed most ridiculous in their opinions, that will not allow this Assembly, the prerogative of knowledge and interpretation, and yet do as∣sume to themselves, perhaps being ignorant in a high nature, a most infallible way of understanding, as well what books are Divine Scripture, as also what interpretation ought truly to be given to eve∣ry Text, though they are plainly forewarned of the danger, by those very Epistles that they themselves have judged to be true Scripture; but as these few proofes may be sufficient, as I said before, to per∣swade any reasonable and competent understan∣ding, concerning the infallibility of this Assembly, instituted by our Saviour, and governed by the Ho∣ly Ghost; this being granted, that of necessity we must believe the Assembly, we cannot by any rea∣son deny our obedience to the Authority. But here perhaps may come a new question, ac∣cording to some Athiestical Tenents of these times,Against the Tenents of the age, that would onely have a Law of nature or Morality for people to fol∣low. whether or no God Almighty have appointed man any other rules, then the Law of nature, measured out only by his own private judgement? which cer∣tainly are most grosse and absurd opinions; for by these maxims, there should be no difference be∣tween men and beasts in their course of living, since the latter have a kinde of order allowed them to use by the meer instinct of nature, though they want reason. As for example, they ingender sea∣sonably, procure to themselves competent food and rest, with a certain care also of their own preserva∣tion, and in like manner will defend those of their
kinde; sometimes with the desperate hazard of their lives. And man by this rule should do no more, which not onely seems repugnant to Gods wisdome, but is against the dignity of mans creati∣on; in his not receiving or enjoying some preroga∣tive in his employment whilst he is here, by reason of his eternal condition hereafter; so that with∣out doubt God Almighty intended man, some ex∣traordinary work in this world beyond other crea∣tures that were ordained meerly for his use and sub∣sistence, having placed in him a reasonable and un∣derstanding soul. And certainly this employment can be no other then some immediate and particu∣lar service belonging to his own worship, which other creatures are not able to perform, as being no way needful for their condition, since they can nei∣ther know God, or are to expect any thing after this life is ended. Whereas man being capable of both, his Creator hath placed him here for some time, that he may make use of his own faculties, either for his benefit or condemnation; but for a further confir∣mation of this Reason, there never was yet any people so rude and ignorant in their conversation, but used a reverence, if not a real worship or Sacri∣fice to some supposed Deity or other, which they not onely counted most sacred, but themselves particu∣larly with a kinde of a wonderful awe were restrain∣ed from offending in their conceived rights, as fear∣ing otherwise they might be punished by a superna∣tural power; which either shewes that nature it self teacheth all people to observe such principles, or that they had in the general received by tradition
some Documents to that purpose, from the very in∣fancy of the world, though they had lost the perfect use of them. For it is not to be supposed, that men ever living amongst Rocks and Mountains, could without any manner of information or instruction, have invented so much of Divinity as we have de∣clared, without some inducements, since no mysti∣cal profession doth seem to agree with their rough kinde of conversation, or wilde appetites; and therefore such people could not but desire to be at the most liberty. So that as it is evident, by all the grounds of Nature, and Arguments of Reason, that God Almighty hath designed himself a particular worship upon earth, so hath he revealed the manner how to be performed from time to time to his Church, which for the most part put it down in wri∣ting, conserving such Records inviolably without corruption, and delivered them in that manner to posterity with many other Truths, by way of ver∣bal Tradition, as the Articles of our Creed, and the like, amongst which Precepts we have the Ten Commandments, that in effect contain the whole Law both Divine and Moral; wherefore since it is apparant, that our great Creator, hath appointed his Godhead a real worship in this world from man, answerable to the dignity of his Creation; and that he hath revealed the particulars of his pleasure by Scripture, the truth of which Records, being to be tryed and approved by the Church, having onely the spirit of right interpretation, we are by an infal∣lible consequence not onely to obey, but relye upon this Assembly.
Some general instructions concerning the pra∣ctice of Gods own proper and im∣mediate worship. BUt now that we have found out that God Al∣mighty must have a real worship, we are as well to be instrcted how it must be effected, which may be reduced to these particulars. First, that there must be used a holy and divine Sacrifice, that was instituted by our Saviour Jesus Christ, as an essenti∣al duty belonging to his Majesty and Godhead, which cannot appertain by any means to any crea∣ture. Next we are taught also, that it be perfor∣med with an outward reverence and an inward in∣tention, accompanied with love and attentivenesse; however, more particularly to be observed and put in practice, at those times when we are obliged by the orders and rules of the Church, to give our per∣sonal attendance at this grand duty commanded. And so by consequence not to entermix our devoti∣ons willingly, with any vain or idle cogitations, since if such distractions be frequent, they are appa∣rant demonstrations, that although God Almighty hath our body in point of Ceremony, yet he doth not possesse the heart in matter of love. For when we are transported by diversity of objects, it is un∣possible but that there must be some defect in affe∣ction;
to prevent which, when we perceive such distempers, to steal upon our deceived Senses and wandering appetites, by reason of the frailty of our nature, that ever seeks the lowest Center, ac∣cording to the base matter of which our bodies were first framed, we are obliged by a speedy and discreet correction (upon the least apprehension) to call in question our omissions, before a Religious judgement. And this principally, to prevent an ill custome growing upon us, lest it may soon take so great footing in our manners, that if not resisted within a short time, will absolutely, though una∣wares, destroy that Grace in our souls that is neces∣sary, as well to keep us from being overcome by dangerous temptations, as to make up capable of doing good instead of evil. 'Tis true, such a con∣tention at the first, may prove something irksome to many; especially to youthful dispositions, that commonly take delight in varieties, who naturally are distasted and wearied with setled objects; yet certainly the more such a vertue is practised with courage and resolution, the greater ease shall a per∣son finde daily in his devotions, untill it bring him in the end, not onely to obtain an absolute victory over most of his passions, but even to entertain a singular delight in every exercise of Religion; which once made a mans chief businesse, I am per∣swaded, their is neither honours, sensualities, or any worldly pleasure can afford so much content; but for the better obtaining of which benefit, we ought not at any time to pretermit our daily and ordinary customes of devout exercises, whether in reading
or praying, without urgent occasion, upon any flat∣tring pretensions of conveniency & necessity, that the devil and the flesh do often suggest to our wa∣vering imaginations, as baits onely laid for diversi∣on, lest by such omissions we contract more sloth∣ful inclinations in our selves concerning the perfor∣mance of any vertue; when as of the contrary, in observing punctually times and seasons for our de∣votions, we shall apparantly finde a kinde of hear∣ty zeal in our soules towards Gods service in most things. As for the purpose, there be some people, that will sit in a manner continually day and night at Cards or the like, without ever seeming to be ty∣red, when as the least time spent in holy exercises, is a vexation to their thoughts: Whilst of the other side, such employment to a truely religious man, in a Monastery, to be enjoyned him as a penance, would appear perhaps to be a mortification of some extraordinary nature. The reason being onely this, that the one hath procured such a proportion of Grace, by his frequent and diligent observation of his duty, that it renders the contrary distastful unto him; whereas worldly persons have so benummed their zeal, and deaded their understanding by give∣ing way upon all occasions to sensualities, that no∣thing seems delightful to their thoughts, that is mi∣xed with any religious observation. Also many new converts in their first entrance into Religion, appear wonderful zealous in their profession, be∣cause for the most part, they employ their whole time concerning the businesse they are about, by reason of the need they have of instruction in forms
and customs; whereas others of a longer standing not seldom are wearied out with knowing too much, and practising too little; and so by degrees begin to slack in their daily and ordinary devoti∣ons, until at last they make what is or ought to be a duty, a meer formal Ceremony and no more; which shews that intentional diligence procures fervour, and fervour obtains Grace. But certainly as no cold way of devotion can possibly please God, since he hath declared to spue them out of his mouth, who are onely lukewarm in his service; so have we multitudes of testimonies even amongst the barba∣rous Gentiles, as if nature it self taught a man a fervour should be used in his Religion, without any other instruction. In testimony of which we read, that when Agamemnon and the other Princes of Greece were to take their journey toward the City of Troy, it was thought a necessary duty, whereby to make their voyage prosperous, and to appease the anger of the Goddess Diana, that their Captain & General should Sacrifice his own daughter; which truely was a sufficient expression of fear to offend those false deities, as also a most evident argument of the care those people had, diligently to perform their Rites, and observe those principles comman∣ded them. In like manner the Romans never came home with victory obtained against their enemies, but the first thing they did when they entred the Town, was to visit the Temple of Iupiter in the Ca∣pitol with Triumph, whereby to render thanks to the gods for their successe, and this Ceremony was not to be performed by themselves in person, but
being accompanied with their whole Army, that all might be partakers and joyn in the common duty and Sacrifice. In Holy Scripture we finde that the Priests of the dumb Idol Baal, performed their impi∣ous devotions in their contentions with righteous Elias, by strange and wonderful cuttings and mang∣ling of their bodies, to render the god propitious to their Prayers; which truly were effectual signs of their earnest thoughts, though pernicious actions. A∣gain, with what extraordinary want of compassion both to themselves and posterity, did the deluded people sacrifice thier own children by fire to Molech, accompanied with the noise and sound of many in∣struments, because their ears should not be won to any manner of pity, by reason of their fearful shrikes and cries, whilst their bodies were burning, and consuming in that terrible manner. All which no doubt could not be done without a great deal of fervour and confidence in their horrid and barba∣rous rights, that at least may serve to reprove the cold practices and customes of these times. Besides if we seriously reflect upon the intentional devoti∣on of the tyrannical Turks, we may finde perhaps occasion enough (by reason of their frequent ex∣ample) to condemn our extravagant thoughts and loose actions in the performance both of our exteri∣or and interior duties in our sacred and comman∣ded Religion: Since as it is confidently reported, there are many Santons or Saints, as they call them, living in that Country, who having made a Pilgri∣mage to the Tomb of their false Prophet Mahomet, have put out their own eyes, because they would
be no more obliged to behold any earthly things; as esteeming all other sights (after this supposed ho∣ly journey) most vile and prophane, and in this manner resolve; to die cloystered up in some dark Dungeon, excluded from the conversation of man∣kinde. O God, if the devil have such power, to infuse these resolutions into the stony hearts of ig∣norant Infidels, what infernal madnesse is it, that not onely obstructs so much divine cogitations of Chri∣stians, being present at those sacred mysteries, But, when they are absent, involves all their thoughts and actions in a thousand fantastical and dangerous sensualities: to whom I must proclaim, that their condition in the day of judgement, will be a milli∣on of times worse, then the state of those that igno∣rantly worship any false deity, with a hearty zeal: for certainly God Almighty more looks at the in∣tention of man, then at the capacity he hath to do him service, since no humane employment whatso∣ever can in its own nature, any way be beneficial to his Godhead or Divinity, but meerly by accident as it tends to our own salvation, wherein his mercy and goodnesse doth more abundantly appear. Wherefore as we see, not onely by the direction of the Church, but by the examples of all other people in the world, there is a necessity of a certain kinde of fervour in all manner of acts of devotion; however, more especially in the essential part of Gods worship; So ought it be esteemed the most highest Treason against the Majesty of God to deny him publiquely, when there is occasion of such con∣fession, or hypocritically to use this service as a stall
only to compasse wordly ends by a seeming though not hearty compliance: and to this purpose often-times perhaps many people come to the Sacraments, bespotted inwardly with divers hidden crimes, without having made due examination of their own Consciences, or putting on any resolution to mend either for the present, or perchance to quit their sins till they leave them. In which posture they neither make true confessions, or resolve upon any charitable satisfaction; whereas we are obliged by the declared principles of this infallible Church, I have so often mentioned (the very Conduit that conveys unto us, if not the Grace of God, yet at leastwise the knowledge how we may obtain it) to cleer our Consciences from all fraud and deceit; and with a most humble and sorrowful reverence, to approach those high and dreadful mysteries, ordain∣ed for mans salvation. Which being impiously perverted, turn into the worst corruption concern∣ing our manners; however, it self being intirely pure, can receive no detriment at all. Wherefore I say, let those fantastical spirits, that either make ends or humour a parcel, if not oftentimes the chief part of their Religion, take heed, lest not one∣ly the judgement of God punish with rigour their hypocrisies in the next world, which will not be pre∣vented, but also shew some marks of his indignati∣on in this life, against their impious dissemblings; since many terrible examples might be produced to that effect out of very approved Authors, if there were any need to strengthen this certainty by hu∣mane relations. For it is sufficient we have admoniti∣ons
and instructions out of very Scripture it self, the best warrant of all others, which saith, omitting divers others, that the flesh profiteth nothing; to be understood in my opinion, that the receiving of the blessed Sacrament availeth not one jot in out∣ward Ceremonie, unlesse it be accompanied by a real and pure intention of the receiver. Which was also apparantly verifyed in the last Supper our Saviour made with his Apostles, when as the eleven were strongly confirmed in their faith and vertue, by their good intentions in that holy institution and exercise, as bringing love to accompany their duty and service, whereas Iudas that wicked Traytor eat Christs body with a false heart and a corrupt soule, which made him not onely at that very instant go go forth hastily to perform his horrible intention, without seeming at all to reflect upon the hainous∣nesse of his crime, but afterwards it took from him the least appearance of any Grace, insomuch as he neither could not repent, or have any confidence in Gods forgivenesse; and therefore, onely in a despe∣rate manner returned the money he had taken, and presently went and hanged himself, who else might have found as much mercy as the Thief did upon the Crosse; Since Gods goodnesse is beyond all transgressions of man, provided there be a fitting compliance on his part; which however as I say, cannot be obtained, being accompanyed with any manner of hypocrisie and dissimulation, in regard God Almighty is onely the God of Truth, and not of deceit, as himself hath often declared. Besides, Saint Paul tells us, that he that takes the Sacrament
unworthily, decerneth not the Lords body, to his further guilt and condemnation. So that we may confidently conclude, Who doth not prepare him∣self as he should, in the entertaining of this admi∣rable benefit intended for mans preservation and salvation, doth fit his person the readier for the de∣vils service and possession; since (as I said before) God Almighty doth chiefly aym at the heart and in∣tention, without which he will not be pleased, by what formality soever; neither can his omnipotent justice be cousened by any humane hypocrisie, since his divine Science was able, as you have heard, to sift the subtile thoughts of the very Angels before they fell; wherefore it is a most ridiculous Chymera to think, that the grosse craft of man can cover or conceal anything from his infinite knowledge, and as much simplicity accompanied with impiety, to believe, that man hath power to prevent his own punishment, if he offend this omnipotent Science in this nature. Which being granted, the onely way to make this necessary preparation is, exactly to follow the rules and directions of the Church; that is, intirely to be sorrowful for our faults, to confesse them truly without any manner of guile or affectation; and lastly (though not least of all) to make full and willing satisfaction to any we have injured, without all which conditions, as no seem∣ing absolution that is given, can be valid, so shall the receiving not onely be most horrid, but the greatest sacriledge can be committed upon earth, since neither long Prayers, exact Fastings, or fre∣quent Almes deeds can profit anything to purpose,
without these punctual or intentional observations: for its said that God Almighty is a jealous God, and will not be satisfied without our whole heart and best actions, which being freely bestowed upon him, he is not onely most easie to be pleased, but ready in every occasion to cover and forgive the frailty of our nature, that at the best hath sufficient need of the assistance of his heavenly Grace, being else able to do nothing. These considerations may serve to put us in minde as well of our own duty that we owe our Creator, by an exterior and interior Sacri∣fice, with other observations contained (upon the matter) in the first three Commandments belong∣ing immediately to the proper and particular wor∣ship of God; as also ought bring in like manner in∣to our remembrance other duties, appertaining to humanity and conversation, numbred, as I may say, in the last seven injunctions delivered to Moses. Where it may be noted, that God Almighty was pleased to shew a most admirable goodnesse, in that he took but three Commandments to himself, and left the rest for our neighbours benefit, whereby the better to conserve charity in all our intentions. But for that the suppressing of our passions and appe∣tites is the only way to begin these common duties, without which they cannot well be performed, I shall discourse chiefly upon two Capital sins, namely pride and sensuality, which in truth con∣tain or occasion all other vices; the one seeming to bear greatest domination in the soul, as the other doth in the body. And first I will speak of pride, in regard it maketh war with the noblest part, that
we have immediately received from God by way of infusion, though joyned with our earthly sub∣stance, or over-powred by it, it becometh lesse able to act towards the intention of our Creation. Of Pride beeng the chief vice belonging to the Soule. PRide, I may say, not onely fools the understan∣ding to errour, but involves our actions with in∣justice. Being composed of partial self-love, and extraordinary false opinion, not suffering us to know our selves rightly, or behold others with in∣differency. And was so odious to Almighty God in the beginning, that he punished the first demon∣stration thereof in the Angels, by the greatest effects of his wrath, as of the contrary, he redeemed man∣kinde by the highest example of humility, con∣demning them without revocation, because they had so offended against the Majesty of his glory, with a kinde of a knowing presumption, and saved us by the passion of his onely Son, for that our frail∣ty seemed something to plead our pardon before the Throne of his Mercy. Pride confounded Pharoah and all his host in the Red Sea, when as the humili∣ty of Moses conducted the children of Israel safely to the Land of Promise. In fine, the meeknesse of the blessed Virgin made her the Mother of God, the greatest prerogative could be bestowed upon
mortality: and insolency turned the mightiest Mo∣narch of the earth into the nature of a beast, one∣ly to feed upon the herbs of the field. This violent Lunacy, I say, is the more hard to be perceived, for that however it be lofty in its own proper quality, yet it doth not alone appertain to persons of the highest conditions, which shewes it claims a hidden and secret interest in the Soule, not alwayes appear∣ing visible; for that there must be some certain con∣currency of power to make it shew it self to others; however, it proves to be of a most dangerous con∣sequence, when it gains too great a liberty of work∣ing amongst the common people, that lack both e∣ducation and discretion to temper their own rude appetites; as being not so sensible as nobler persons of honour and humanity, which renders them alto∣gether barbarous, when eminency as an object of their envy, comes within the compasse of their power and spight, which might be demonstrated by many sad, bloody, and terrible examples. But as it is unpossible to judge rightly of this humour in the disposition of any man, because it consists in so ma∣ny several expressions, and appears upon divers and multitudes of occasions, so is there no better a way to finde the disease in a bodies own person, then strictly to sift the Conscience by the rules of reason and Religion, with a kinde of equal consideration, free from all partiality; that is to say, whether or no he intend all the honour and esteem he desireth, chiefly for the service of God, accompanied with a due consideration of the intention of his Creation, whereby he may not exact from another in his mind
some unlawful due, more then appertains unto him∣self, to some others losse or derogation; for otherwise I will not call any manner of respect that is desired pride. Since as naturally we can but covet our own good, and so consequently to attempt esteem. So when it is demanded and required with moderati∣on, as an indubitable right belonging to our fortune, merit, and condition, there is no injury at all done, either to God or a third person. For no doubt e∣very man may as well conserve his honour as his e∣state, both being inherent rights to him and his posterity. And certainly those that deny us those national dues, are not onely themselves injurious, but may be justly taxed of pride, if not of rude in∣solency; which I rather say, because in these days there may be noted a strange kinde of injurious in∣tention in most of the inferior sort of people, to withdraw themselves from observing all ancient decorum in this nature. An appetite in my opini∣on that hath not onely lately distracted exceedingly the government of this kingdom, but hath destroy∣ed already much of the glory of the Nation, since convenient degrees must be observed to render any Commonwealth happy, lest confusion at last take away what is necessary for Magistracy and obedi∣ence towards peace and unity. But of the contra∣ry, if we perceive our inclinations only given to stu∣dy vaingloriously our own private esteem, without having either due consideration of others rights, or charitably being willing to reflect upon meaner conditions, in that they are subordinate to us in the
worlds eye, though equal with us in Creation; without doubt we may conclude, that some dan∣gerous inflammations doth possess our inward parts that will not long want a subject to work upon. Neverthelesse the humour of it self for the most part is ridiculous, since it is not the vain opinion of our own personal deserts, that can render us more worthy in the thoughts of others, if we deserve not the consideration, and if we do merit a particular regard in some few things, we destroy that estimation we covet oftentimes by expressing too much vio∣lence in the desire. There is another kinde of ig∣noble pride, proceeding from low and poore thoughts, and not from the inflammation of ho∣nour and courage, which makes people, though in∣solent in posterity, yet most base and dejected in ad∣versity, rather courting respect and esteem by way of flattery, from contemptible persons upon any false tearms of injustice, then industriously endea∣vouring brave and gallant designs to gain commen∣dations. This I know to be the custome of many, who seem to desire vulgar peoples applause, when they appear carelesse of the knowing approbation of religious and worthy men, either being perhaps confident of the number of the commenders, or not having a sufficient capacity to judge of the right value of both. However, to compasse which the better, they will professe a kinde of equality in their actions, with the worst of their companions, as if neither birth nor vertue were to be esteemed: pretending this to be done out of good nature and some humility extraordinary in their dispositions,
so to level themselves with others, when I am confi∣dent often times, is proceeds from the quintescence of Pride, as not knowing else how to be so well ob∣served. Thus much I have said, because I would not have these low humours of the age be taken for humility, or a constant and laudable bravery in mens thoughts and actions, to be interpreted pride, since the custome of the one, and the want of practice of the other, not onely made our Ancestors glorious, but have rendred our selves most unhappy. For where stations are not kept to measure out to people their desert, it is unpossible with any confidence or alacrity to prosecute to the end the course of ver∣tue; which Rome, however a Commonwealth, ob∣served most punctually, or else could never have come to that greatnesse; and to this purpose all de∣grees had their places, to distinguish worth and me∣rit, as marks of political reward, though now that rule and order, as I may say, is esteemed either folly or presumption. 'Tis true, I cannot deny, but there hath been shewed often times in the actions of great Monarchs, too great an insolence concerning their deportments; ignorance certainly being the cause at any time, why pride appears too much to outward view. But withal, we finde Nero the very worst of humane monsters, was more then besotted in his disposition, with a vain and foolish ambition of popular praise, that rendered him not onely ri∣diculous to all men of a noble and worthy conversa∣tion, but made him really cruel to all such as oppo∣sed that humour, not being willing to see a mighty Emperour contend with common fidlers in the o∣pen
Theatre, for vulgar applause, and in that posture to wipe away the sweat with his own hand, because the people were delighted with his observation of their ordinary customs; which certainly he did on∣ly because he was transported with a mad and pre∣posterous desire of praise, proceeding no doubt, from the highest instigation of pride. And yet this proud man was so base in his disposition, though foolish in his thoughts, that when his wickednesse had de∣servedly tumbled him from his Empire, his deluded fancy was yet bewitched with a ridiculous vain∣glory, insomuch, as he aymed at nothing but to be consined into the Country of Egypt, there to exer∣cise his trade of singing amongst the common peo∣ple, whose applause he violently coveted (as it may be imagined) beyond all other greatnesse. So that we may conclude, as Pride often times is accompa∣nied with the worst cruelty, so not seldom is it joyned with a contemptible want of courage: wit∣nesse also the ordinary people of Holland, who are insolent without measure, and yet cowardly beyond other Nations; however, they have had alwayes that good fortune, to make other Countries to fight for their pride, which themselves personally durst not maintain. Certainly, a noble disposition either hates Pride, or tempers it with humanity, which at least renders it sufferable, whereas the contrary makes it barbarous. But for that the effects are di∣vers, according to accidents and natures, we shall discourse a little of several parts of this humor.
Many dependencies belonging to this infernal Lady Pride. THere is no doubt but Pride may be without en∣vy, though envy cannot be without Pride; therefore may be likened to extracted poyson from a dangerous Plant, for that Pride is not deadly of it self, but by way of use and application, retaining the capacity, though not always working the effect. But envy of the contrary, ever hurts either a mans self or others; And remains like a concealed flame, at the best seeking occasion to burst forth to the de∣struction of some good thing, and in the interim consumes where it lies hid. Neither can it at all be satisfied, because it ayms not onely at unreasonable, but unpossible periods; that is, to darken the Sun∣shine of vertue, which will now and then appear in spight of what black clouds soever of malice, for that it is of a pure and prevailing substance by na∣ture; whereas those of grosser and more ignoble composures are dispersed by every winde or little rain of discovery; for although false and counter∣feit stones, sometimes with false and sophisticated art, may shew fair to the view of ignorant persons, yet when the Diamond is produced in competition, they soon lose their luster and belief. Most com∣monly this appetite is ingendred in those persons,
who are defective in themselves, though they do not sufficiently perceive their own infirmity, and lesse the capacity of others to discern; and by that means in a wrong posture go about to set up their particular esteem, or violently seek to pull down o∣thers to their own level. This humour truly is so much practised in this age, as I have heard some say, that shortly it would be esteemed a crime to laugh, for fear of being held to enjoy too much innocent content, though without other eminency. Which makes me in my thoughts to cry out for Academies, to instruct youth in vertue and morality. For if peo∣ple would but strive by a noble industry, to render themselves deserved patterns of emulation, and not examples of envy to others, there would be no time left them, to entertain so unprofitable a disposition, from whence proceeds nothing but falsenesse in conversation, distraction in absence, and revenge in actions, without any benefit at all purchased ther∣by, either to present content, or future satisfaction. The property of Revenge.As envy may be said to be a corroding mineral, drawn from that huge mountain Pride, so revenge may be compared to hot and firy vapours, that often break from thence, to a kinde of ominous destructi∣on. Or rather may be termed Prides worst executi∣oner & bloody servant. But however, it aims always at dangerous and unhappy periods, yet certainly the progresse it makes for the most part is sweet and pleasant to depraved natures, since it affords not onely delight by reason of that victory it alwayes hopes for, but prove extreamly pleased and satisfi∣ed, being obtained; however, I must confesse, the
joy indures not long; for most commonly some kinde of despair followes soon after; yet never∣thelesse, in the interim during the prosecution, a wicked man is not much tormented in his thoughts, for that the passion of revenge, doth alwayes tran∣scend the apprehension of danger, which is the rea∣son that so unhappy a resolution is continued; for notwithstanding it proceeds no further then inten∣tion, wanting time and conveniency to execute, yet the determination all the while is so strongly ac∣companyed, with hope of effecting, and so busied in seeking the best opportunity, that it never gives a person of a malicious nature, leasure to be sad or melancholly: Whereas of the contrary, envy seems still to oppresse with a cold despair, that never af∣fords any manner of content or satisfaction. Al∣though envy be the less dangerous properly, yet cer∣tainly revenge is the more noble humour, for that it is still accompanyed with some hazard, whereas the other seems ever to bark afar off, or whisper pri∣vately in the dark; though perchance neither have hearts good enough to forgive, or great enough to forget; revenge is justifiable in none but in the su∣preme power, who is pleased to call his divine ju∣stice by that name; for he may onely revenge inju∣ries with rutribution, whilst we alone can but consi∣der them with an intention of prevention, since if we go further, we do but usurp his office and con∣demn our selves. Neverthelesse, we may safely pu∣nish, having lawful Commission, derived from his heavenly sword of Justice, established here upon earth for our more honest and regular conversation;
though this too must be put in execution without all partiality, lest revenge happen to be encreased by hypocrisie under the pretence of justice. The next imperfection of the Soul I will mention shall be Vain-glory,Of Vainglory. which in truth is no other then a certain kind of weak lunacy or fantastical madnesse, ingendred between pride and want of judgement, for that instead of perswading our actions to be e∣steemed by others, thereby we make our own per∣sons become ridiculous; since for the most part we dream that every extravagancy, should procure be∣lief and opinion in those, that have no cause to be partial. Besides, the humour or vanity is accom∣panied with some species of ill nature, as well as fol∣ly; for they that possesse these fancies in their dis∣positions, look so much upon thir own passions, that they altogether passe by anothers deserts, by which means they fall oftentimes to be hated by all, in∣stead of being valued by any; as it were never see∣ing but through a perspective glasse, at both ends, where they either behold too much, or apprehend too little; not being able to judge rightly of their own wants or others perfections. By which means they appeare most commonly like men half drunk, that are readier for expression, though unfitter for action. Which I may say again, is a passion so much in fashion in these times, that people seem to be transported with certain thoughts, as if they had been onely their own creators▪ scarce allowing God Almighty any share at all in their being and for∣tunes. To cure this disease, men ought to look up∣on God not onely as the Author of every good, but
also to conceive each reasonable Creature to be fram∣ed by the same hand, wherein no difference hath been made and intended, but by accident or Grace. For as the Diamond and the Flint are not of equal vertues in every respect; so each is profitable in its kinde: the one bearing price, as the other produ∣ceth fire; wherein the latter seemes notwithstan∣ding better to comply with mans commodity, though the former rather procures admiration. So that if we have parts above others in our own ap∣prehensions, let us make use of them with mode∣sty, and they will appear more illustrious to the eye of the world; if we want such abilities, though we may (in some sort) cover our defects, we ought rather make them up with our goodnesse, then ren∣der our selves worse by assuming what is none of our own, to the injury of others. Disobedience is not onely another effect of Pride,Disobedience another effect of Pride. but was the first sin that ever was committed upon earth by humanity, wherein God Almighty was so displeased against man, that nothing but the death of his own Son could asswage his wrath. Besides, the contrary is so necessary a property to be continued ed in all conditions, that the world cannot subsist without it. However, I may boldly say, this latter age hath not onely created strange thoughts con∣cerning this duty, but almost hourely produceth wonderful examples against the maxime: however we shall set down only three common duties of this kinde, proceeding from the first infancy of the world, which have been made good eversince, both by the Commandments of God, and all Moral Do∣cuments.
We will first begin with that obedience that is due from Children to their Parents, which (setting aside Gods own immediate Precepts) is an obligation challenged by way of natural right, for having brought us into the world, that else should have been nothing; Children are bound to afford their Parents, at all times, and upon every fitting occasion, an obsequious reverence, though never so much under anothers jurisdiction; as also another duty of gratitude for their education and preserva∣tion in their infancy, which neverthelesse is to be e∣steemed more or lesse, according to the care was had of their persons, when they were not able to provide for themselves; insomuch, as no deficiency of the Parents part (in my opinion) can take a∣way altogether that humane respect and honour that is due by nature. As for example, When a daughter is bestowed in marriage, although by that means she becometh under anothers jurisdiction, and in that regard, cannot dispose of her self with∣out her husbands leave, towards their service, yet certainly she is still obliged to afford them upon all convenient occasions, a dutiful reverence; neverthe∣lesse, I must confesse in these times, we hold it suffici∣ent satisfaction, if children become not wholly re∣probates to their own destruction, without having any consideration of their Parents particular. The next obligation of obedience is due from servants to their Masters, which however it be limited to time and contract, is not onely to be observed in Consci∣ence according to the conditions agreed upon; but also there is a civil duty of respect to be observed, af∣ter
the time is expired, unlesse some just cause hath been given to the contrary. But, for that I intend to speak something more hereof in another place, I shall mention onely now the last obedience, which is due from the Subjects to their Prince, insti∣tuted, as I may say, in the beginning of the world, which may be divided into three kinds. The first was that purchased by Nimrod, being wholly usurped and therefore might have been cast off again, upon the first opportunity: however, the continuance did perhaps render it lawful to posterity. The se∣cond was domestick or voluntary, verified in the person af Abraham, over his pious and godly fami∣ly, which was approved no doubt by God Almigh∣ty, when he commanded them to fight with those who had taken unjustly Lot prisoner; again, Abra∣hams Dominion was justified, when he tyed his ser∣vant▪ by an oath to provide a wife for his son: and the last is that of compact and agreement, which makes subjects by their own consent become un∣der the power of rule, as may be testified by Pha∣roah and his people; which work was brought about by Ioseph, when his subjects changed their liberty for subsistence and livelihood. And this being con∣tracted for, and afterward confirmed by proscripti∣on, could not again be cast off, without incurring the penalties belonging to Rebellion. For the Jews could not have avoided the lawfulnesse of the ju∣risdiction (notwithstanding their cruel persecuti∣on and slavery) but that it was the declared will of God, revealed particularly to Moses, this by that means they should be freed from their misery, under
whose power are rightly contained, all the govern∣ments of the earth. Of IngratitudeIngratitude is not onely another effect of Pride, but may be said to be a most ignoble property, since it doth not onely defraud goodnesse of its due, but seems not willingly to encourage vertue in any kind which was the reason that the wise and brave Ro∣mans, ranked it amongst the worst of vices, and to that purpose appointed punishments for the offeh∣ders. God Almighty first fell out with Cain for his ingratitude, though he afterwards condemned him for his hypocrisie. Truly I may affirm, this vice ap∣pears to have gotten a particular jurisdiction in this Nation at present, since many of those most obliged prove the greatest Traytors to their benefactors; neither is this done covertly and in the dark, but most commonly is owned as a piece of excellent wit; and so consequently esteemed a kinde of ver∣tue, for servants to be unfaithful in their duty, or friends to deceive trusts committed unto them: and so far hath private interest taken possession of ho∣nour, good nature, and conscience, that every per∣son that walks according to these old maxims, is ei∣ther esteemed a fool or a Heretick. Certainly God punished the devils with the greater indignation, for that in their thoughts they were unwilling to be thankful for his benefits; whereas man had a con∣dition annexed to his condemnation, because it was frailty rather then an intention of ingratitude, that caused him to offend; however, he seemed more really and punctually to have broken his Command∣ment. For my part I hold those as worthy that
raise monuments to vertue, as those which good for∣tune hath made famous; since however they may have wanted the opportunity and conveniency of acting, yet neverthelesse they retain in their minds a certain intention of honour. The next appetite of Pride is ambition, however it is onely it but by accident or intention,Of Ambition and its proper∣ty. since no∣thing renders that name unlawful, but either too much passion in the prosecution, or over much de∣sire by way of private interest; yet some perhaps will quarrel with the name onely, which I cannot but except against; for as the too much coveting of honour and preferment out of a personal respect, renders the desire unjustifiable: and so by conse∣quence proves to be a meer ambition; so of the o∣ther side, a moderate seeking of a just esteem, is no more then a natural indulgency, warrantable in our humane condition, since without this hope for the most part, our noble endeavours should want re∣compence, whereby mens vertuous intentions would cool in the prosecution, before they could come to a ripenesse fit for use or example. For if our frail natures had no other object to behold, then barely that reward we are to expect in the next world, it is to be much feared, that people would grow so slack in endeavouring of laudable (nay I may say) necessary things, that at last all honour and vertue would be in danger to be wholly neg∣lected, by which means unworthy persons should com to be of equal Authority with the best, and no priviledge at all given to industry. As for exam∣ple; What souldier would expose himself willingly
to the hazard of the Cannon, without some expe∣ctation of recompence from his General; or if a baser man then he were to be esteemed alike. Nay let us but consider, how many great Schollers or grave Clergy-men, notwithstanding they are suffici∣ently acquainted with the depth of Conscionable rules and maximes, would with so much violence follow their studies to gain learning, unlesse they thought their Science should advance them above other men in estimation? though some few may be found altogether mortified in their worldly passi∣ons. We see also Children and youths are induced to learn, by promised honour and preferment in their studies during their being at School. And certainly their pious and Religious Masters, would not ingraft in their tender yeers such principles, if every kinde of ambition in its own nature were un∣lawful; for most commonly what inclinations we take when we are young, do very seldom quit us in our age; and more especially those thoughts, that tast either of ambition or covetousnesse. Where∣fore we may be satisfied, that it is not the desiring of any lawful thing that creates an ambition in our mindes, but the over desiring onely; and truly in doing so, we do but resemble a bedlam, who vio∣lently catcheth at a handful of ayre, supposing he hath something in his hand, which being opened, proves but imagination.Of covetous¦nesse as a de∣pendant of Bride. For the too much desire increaseth opinion, and that is made lesse by expe∣rience, until at last it falls into nothing at all, agree∣ing with our imaginary expectation. Lastly, we will come to the covetousnesse of the age, a mad ef∣fect
also of the minde, wherein for the most part little reality appears, in that we desire to be owners more of wealth, then to have the sruition thereof; since commonly in our own persons we make use but of a small portion of what we covet; it seems to have the neerest affinity with ambition, for as the extream aspiring man gives his thoughts no repose, by reason of his over aiming desires; so cannot the avaritious person scarce afford his necessities sufficient, in re∣gard of that craving and unsatisfied humour. Wherefore properly, they may both be esteemed brothers in folly, as well as in sin. Since alike they onely please the fancy, not reflecting at all, upon the impossibility of compassing what is desired; for the period will still be behinde do what we can, if there be either a greater or a richer man in the world then our selves; and though there should not be any to exceed us, yet certainly our thoughts would run at new Chymera's, either above the clouds, or under the earth. However, I do not say, that either of these appetites are unlawful, but in the handling; for as we may desire honour, so may we purchase wealth; provided it be with the con∣ditions of justice and moderation. But O the in∣fernal covetousnesse of the times! When neither kindred, friendship, gratitude or Religion, are con∣siderations to be put in competition with self inte∣rest. To get wealth we deny our blood; to get wealth we violently break the strongest bonds of trust: to get wealth we forget all courtesies; to get wealth we forbear no sacriledge, in justice, or hypo∣crisie; in conclusion, to obtain this troublesome we
know not what; we slight our parents, we disobey our Magistrates, we rob Churches, we commit mur∣thers, and live in communication more like raven∣ous beasts then humane creatures, laughing in ward∣ly at all considerations of charity, as onely a vain and ridiculous opinion; however ordained as a sa∣cred tye from above, to unite affections in the ser∣vice of our great Creator, without which it is unpos∣sible to please him or save our selves. And thus have I in some sort run through these few passions of the minde, as representations onely of the things we ought to avoid, that properly belonging to Pride; which is the chief mother of mischief that disqui∣eteth the Soul, and hinders it from placing her prin∣cipal felicity in another sphere, where there is ab∣solute honour, content, and security to be had; the fruition of which, as I say, for the most part, are hin∣dred by the extraordinary inflammations of this fantastical humour, being kindled and set on fire by the devils craft, and nourished and fed by the worlds vanities. So that now we must fall upon a new discourse, concerning the imperfections of the body, which however, they are of a more grosse and dull nature; yet are they of little lesse pow∣er then the former to destroy in us, not onely the ef∣fects, but the very appetites of vertue. For how∣ever perhaps they do not raise our thoughts to the forementioned whimsies and Chymera's, yet they blunt and stupifie our apprehensions in such a man∣ner, that we become in time wholly drowned in a Sea of sense and stupidity, not much caring, and lesse knowing what we do However it must be
granted, that this Lady and generall Queen called Luxurie, hath in like manner as well as pride, many attendants, that operate according to severall in∣clinations and dispositions in our fleshly and more ignoble parts, which in order we shall briefly touch as we have occasion. Some kinde of description of Sensuality. SEnsuality may be esteemed either one generall corruption proceeding from a poisoned educati∣on, or a whole Magazin of imperfections, demonstra∣ted according to accidents and opportunity, that for the most part are increased by custome, & continued in age, which seldome admits of any thought of re∣pentance in a man untill the very last houre; and then too perhaps with so little efficacy, that it proves more formall then beneficiall. In this progresse and journey of luxury, the noble soule appeares so to be imprisoned with aboundance of confused ob∣structions, that it hath not sufficient liberty given it to produce any thing worthy of its dignity and creation, as I may say, like some learned Philoso∣pher, captivated amongst boores and clownes, that are neither sensible of honour, or capa∣ble of instruction: As the Angels fels fell by pride which is no other then a lunacy of the minde, so man offended in sensuality that is an inchantment of the flesh; And God Almighty seemed to ballance
these two sinnes by a certaine kind of equality in his heavenly determination; For that, as he punished the divels for their presumption, with an irrevoca∣ble decree, not at all admitting any condition or hope of satisfaction; so did he redeem man by so ad∣mirable a way, as it seemed to exceed the others condemnation and losse: This vice of all others in my opinion, proceeds from the poornesse of mens spirits, either that they would not take education when they might have had it, whereby to have been able better to have imployed their minds in noble cogitations, and honourable actions, or else being overcome by the predomination of their senses, have sloathfully lost that courage that was neces∣sary to maintaine vertue in their thoughts and in∣tentions. Truly we see it is the very propertie of most unreasonable creatures, to conserve with some care and industry the beauty of their being, though not made for eternity, since they to that purpose doe daily order their naturall cloathing to the best advantage, avoyding in the interim all occasions to doe themselves injury and disgrace, lest they might become unusefull in their severall kinds; and yet a sensuall man is not ashamed to sully his soule, and bespot his reputation, not only with wic∣ked, but preposterous vices, almost of all natures and conditions, to gaine a little satisfaction to his appetites, however in effect he continues still un∣satisfied: for I will be bold to say, most commonly such people are so opprest either with sad and hea∣vy thoughts, or overviolent longings, as they are constrained to drive out one vexation after another
with new excesses, which serve for no other end but the more to inflame their desires, untill at last they are brought to such a stupidity, that every ap∣petite whatsoever becomes even unpleasant. Thus consuming their discontented houres in fancies in∣stead of realities, like men in dangerous and despe∣rate dropsies, the more they drink to satisfie their thirst, the lesse have they ease of their paine: But however it be not supposed, that all esteemed sen∣suall people are thus buried alive in a stupidity of viciousnesse, yet neverthelesse give me leave to say, that I have known some eminent persons in these times, that in their youth were famed beyond mea∣sure, for the excellency both of their naturall and artificiall parts and abilities, as well for learning and eloquence, as spirit and courage: yet at last falling into sensuality, according to the custome of the age, they did not onely cast off from their thoughts all manner of seeming apprehension of these noble vertues, but in a short space became also most cow∣ardly and base in their dispositions, in so much as they were content upon all occasions to submit unto the poorest, fearfullest, and lowest kind of sub∣mission could almost possibly be put upon them, rather then move any way to action or vertue: which in my conceipt are admirable effects of this sordid and inglorious imperfection, when it getteth so great a prerogative in mans nature, that the soule hath lost absolutely her priviledge and honour: Witnesse Marke Anthony, that once noble Roman, who most contemptuously lost both his Empire and life, by reason of his sensualities; for in his last ex∣pedition
that was to determine the Monarchy of the World, he left his Souldiers fighting, and shame∣fully followed Cleopatra to her regall City of Alex∣andria, where they were accustomed to spend whole nights and daies in severall luxuries: As another example of basenesse by reason of this ignoble in∣clination, we may look upon the Emperour Vitelius, who having gained the dominion from Otho by the Sword, he lost it againe to Vespasian in sensuality; for which his subjects did so extreamly contemne his person, that being at last taken prisoner in re∣gard of his adversaries prevailing power, he was so shamefully used by the rabble and common people, that a Noble man of honour passing by at the same time, was forced (though not out of compassion to his person, yet out of a respect to that dignity he had once enjoyed) to runne him through with his weapon, because he should not endure more dis∣grace of that miserable nature. And in this manner did this luxurious Prince, (who in his youth not∣withstanding was a gallant man, as appeared by his deportment in Germany) end his wretched daies, as a just reward for his so much degenerating from his former vertues, by his frequent sensualities and debaucheries; whilst his parcimonious and absto∣nious enemy in the mean time raigned with all prosperity and glory could be imagined, not onely accompanied with multitudes of famous conquests, but also left after him for his eternall memory, most wonderfull buildings and monuments; a great part of which being extant to the amazement of the be∣holders. Wherefore I must conclude, that sensuality
takes away from a man the noble & reasonable pro∣perty of the soule, that should not onely cleare his understanding, to the discerning of reputation, but to the practising of vertue; which being stupefied and obstructed, as I say, by continuall ease and plea∣sure, the spirit at last becomes so adulterated, that it is unpossible to entertaine any thing in the dispo∣sition, but some base pride or envy, which for the most part never leaves such people as long as they live; being alwaies maintained and nourished by those flatteries, that accident or rather a kinde of necessity hath cast upon such men, to keepe them waking with some entertainments of recreation: And this is the reason, that no discourses in a man∣ner are heard in their mouths, but detraction pro∣ceeding from the very spirit of malice, because they cannot be at all confident of any goodnesse in them∣selves, whereby to commend laudable vertues in others. Besides, there may be alwaies noted a kinde of cruelty in their natures, proceeding from that they are apt to suspect every thing but flattery: not∣withstanding that deceives them most of all, being in truth the greatest sensuality of all others; for that clawes the soule with such a bewitching har∣mony, that people who are so inclined, become metamorphosed like Vlysses companions, till at last they become even hoggs instead of men. For ano∣ther testimony of what I say, concerning the nature and corruption of sensuality, let us but looke backe at the actions of Alexander, who in the first entrance into his conquest, was mercifull, active, and faith∣full, and yet after when he began to tast too much
of the Persian luxuries, he became cruell, suspitious and proud, in so much as he neither spared his best friends, nor regarded the wisest Philosophers, who proved in the end to be so overcome and inchanted by flattery, that he not only esteemed those people his mortall enemies, that would not adore him for a God, but destroyed their persons with as much spight and malice as could be imagined, untill he rendered himselfe to his own native country hate∣full, if not in some sort ridiculous; which truly a∣mongst others are most pregnant examples to shew how much a man goes from himselfe, when he falls too precipitatly into sensuality; as of the contrary what noble thoughts and gallant actions people are capable of, as long as they keepe their soules cleare from obstructions of this nature. For according to my observation, I never read of a temperate person, that was not attended upon with many other emi∣nent vertues, that made him both happy and fa∣mous, whilest of the other side I have observed for the most part, all noted Tyrants to be branded with a kind of an Infamous opinion of luxury, in the whole course of their lives. Certainly temperance and activity, are the badges of nobility and wisdome, when as sloath and sensuality, are onely inchant∣ments of flesh and bloud, that worke men out of their wits, goodnesse and honour, to make them slaves to the devill and misery: But however in some sort this may serve for a generall demonstration of this naturall imperfection, or rather deprivation of grace, by reason of a mans own selfe, wanting a ne∣cessary courage to resist both weake and strong
temptations of this life; yet for that, as I said before, there are severall distempers arising or belonging to this grand stupidity, though not all appertaining alike to each person and disposition, we shall men∣tion now the quality and practice of some particu∣lar vices, as I conceive, now adaies most in fashion and use, which may be counted meer dependencies upon sensuality. Gluttony a chiefe effect of sensuality, with other vices also belonging thereunto. ANd first we will begin with Gluttony, as seem∣ing to have the next affinity with it. Truly, in this vice man doth not onely come neerest to the nature of a beast, since procuring of food is its chiefe pleasure and property, but by way of intemperance; when practised inordinately in this particular, he seems to exceed unreasonable creatures in disho∣nour; for however they appeare to take their chiefe felicity in eating, yet neverthelesse they feed with some order, by instinct and the direction of their kind, thereby to render themselves more fit for the use they were created; and to that purpose will scarce at any time goe beyond their bounds by any manner of excesse, if they be left to their owne dis∣pose; also procuring to themselves being diseased, remedies of nature: witnesse the gallant Falcon, that takes frequently stones for casting and clen∣sing
of her body, whereby to avoyd all superstuities, to be the better able to make use of her wings for flight, when she hath occasion to shew her courage; neither ordinarily will she covet meat, but when she findes her gorge absolutely emptied of other food: In like manner, every little and contempti∣ble cur, after he hath sufficiently eaten to fill his belly, with a certain kind of temperate providence wil endeavor to hide the rest, to be reserved for ano∣ther repast, without any signe at all of gluttony, as if nature had taught him what was best to be done for his own preservation; Whilst an intemperate man, of all other creatures, seems by his continuall excesses, neither to be governed by reason nor na∣ture: insomuch I have heard many say, that provi∣ded they had good meat, they did not care if they were alwaies obliged to eate it in a hogs-stie, or any other contemptible or dishonourable place; as if the very delight and happinesse of their soules con∣sisted in nothing but eating and drinking: Nay fur∣ther, in these latter times this dull satisfaction of mens appetites hath been so taken up by custome, that not onely women of the best quality, have not been ashamed ordinarily to frequent most impu∣dent and confused entertainments, in base and ob∣scure Tavernes, but also to shew the greater and more extraordinary profusenesse in those meetings; feasts of no small expence have been made without table-cloathes or any other convenient furniture, where nothing for the most part was to be heard, but a certaine confused noise, with the exercise of burning of dublets, and drinking healths out of
shooes, instead of distinct discourses and commenda∣ble recreations: so that I may boldly say, that God Almighty hath found us out in these follies; and certainly will never leave punishing us untill we become more moderate, since in my opinion it is not to be doubted, but these kinds of debauche∣ries so frequently practised have been the greatest cause of our present miseries that we so much com∣plaine of; for by such courses the noble men not onely lost their Honours, but the Gentry spent their Estates, not leaving themselves sufficient interest in the Country to govern the people, with any ad∣vantage tending to peace and unity; and so by de∣grees their own tenants necessarily began to stand more peremptorily upon their own feet, by which meane men of smallest quality came in play, to the overthrow of those of the better sort. Besides this generall intemperancy, most violently raigning a∣mongst the Commanders in the late Kings warres, proved of such an unfortunate consequence to his affaires, by reason of that wilde liberty that every man took to himselfe, that probably it lost him his Kingdome: For, by this means order and rule in his Army was turned into confusion, whereby duties became neglected, trusts corrupted, and mens cou∣rages adulterated, in so much as his Officers instead of giving testimonies of their valour and conduct, they brought their reputations into nothing but scorn and contempt, untill at last they lost both themselves and cause, to those their thoughts never esteemed before. The next attendant that seems to wait upon this
swoln lump of sensuality is lascivious love, that seeks onely to satisfie sense,The inconve∣niences of vain and idle making of love. without having the in∣tention of prosecuting the end of Society, accor∣ding to the ordination of God Almighty in Para∣dise. Which appetite I say, although it be most a∣greeing with the nature of humanity, and in that regard many brave persons have erred, yet certainly lust doth not onely sympathize with the condition of a beast, that is carryed on to that act by a fleshly delight without other design, but seemeth in us to taste something more of wild concupiscence; for however they ingender by kinde without any re∣gard of mixture, because they have no rule prescri∣bed for their actions, yet Providence hath ordained such a temper in their proceedings, that for the most part they observe times and seasons for their copu∣lation. Which shewes that nature in them onely intends procreation, that is all the marriage they are appointed to make, whereby their kinde or species may be preserved upon earth, when as man invol∣ved in this sin, doth not appeare to be restrained ei∣ther by Nature or Grace, but runs on violently in the prosecution of his appetites with a more raging madnesse then those animals, that have but two things enjoyned them by God and Nature, which is procreation and food. When I reflect up∣on these considerations, I cannot but wonder at some people, who having been reproved for their excessivenesse in this vice, and to this purpose were demanded, why they having such noble and beauti∣ful wives, did not content themselves rather with their companies and conversations, then with base
women of a far inferiour degree to them in all man∣ner of perfections, they presently returned this an∣swer, that as they could no way deny the compari∣son, so was there no other reason to be given, but that they were their wives, and the other not; wherein may be noted, the strong temptation and power of the devil in this one vice onely, when he is able so to infatuate our understanding, that we must chuse the lesse worthy subject for the delight of our Senses, rather then the better, for no other reason, but because sin belongeth to the one and not to the other. Which belike made Marke Anthony being of the same disposition, leave his gallant wife Octavia, and cast himself violently into the armes and embrace∣ments of that proud strumpet Cleopatra, notwithstan∣ding she apparantly contemned his person, as she did afterwards undo his fortune. But setting aside these presidents, we may consider many young people of our times, who spend in a manner their whole lives, in nothing but making of foolish love, and sitting in womens chambers at unseasonable houres, without any kinde of intention of marriage, which at the best are high provocations of lust, besides other inconveniences in nourishing of sloath and creating of jealousies. But for that idlenesse for the most part not onely affords the opportunity,Idlenesse the chief nurse not onely of this vice, but of many others. but is the general employ∣ment of the age (if properly doing of nothing may be termed an employment) as another dependant belonging to sensuality, I shall particular the nature and prejudice thereof. Idlenesse hath been esteem∣ed by religious and wisest judgements the ground-work
and Bases of all inconveniencies in mans vo∣cation, since want of some designed employment in resolutions, not onely brings a certain kinde of la∣zie inclination upon the body, but also gives too much leasure to the minde, to dwell upon diversi∣ties, of Chymera's, profitable no way but to breed fancies instead of acting nobly. So that it being unpossible to continue always in imagination with∣out some diversions and recreations, to sweeten a∣gain the over tired spirits, we must of necessity be satisfied with some delight or other, though never so unlawful for refreshment, wherein for the most part affections belonging to flesh and blood, will have the chief interest in our corupt natures. Wher∣fore nothing being neerer at hand to please Sense, then eating, drinking, lust, with other softnesses of the body, as lying in a warm bed, sitting by a fire side, flattering discourses and the like, necessarily man in a short time must take his principal fruition in some or all of these; for, that as I said before, he doth not constantly employ himself and thoughts, towards the accomplishing of any setled thing wor∣thy his consideration. Which may be very well ve∣rified by this common saying, That it is better for a person to rip his garment and sow it again then to be idle. As much to say, that a man ought ever to have some designe a foot, to employ either his mind or body, and is held so unnecessary a thing amongst the unlearned Turks, as we esteem them, that there is none of what quality soever (the Emperour not excepted) but hath some certain trade or other put upon his condition. We finde that God Almighty
even challenged this duty from man in his first Cre∣ation, when he ordained him to prune and dresse the garden of Paradise. As also being driven from thence he continued him still that injunction, decla∣ring not onely by his works that the earth should not bring forth fruits, but by mans labour and in∣dustry, but also let him know that he was to gain his living by the sweat of his brows, as also that his wife with all other women descending from her, were designed to bear children by trouble and pain. Nay, we may say, that nature her self seemeth in all things to have such an intention, when not onely every living Creature, but the Plants of the field have an industrious intention to labour and yeerly to renew their cloathing, as if they went in a circle of travail and employment, though to my no small amazement, I have heard many in this corrupt age, not ashamed to brag open∣ly, that they were good for nothing, intimating as though industry and intention were an apparant dishonour. Amongst which number, I have known some so supinely negligent and lazie, that they could not finde a time to perform any necessary bu∣sinesse, by reason of their confused resolutions, that never designed any certain time when to begin, and so from one hour to another, deferred the things they were to do, until at last perhaps they lost wholly the opportunity, though ever had the determination. In fine, I cannot but conclude with this opinion, that as idlenesse is a most dishonourable and unpro∣fitable vice, since it seems to pervert the very in∣tention both of God and nature, either by false ap∣prehensions
or too much sensuality, so for the most part doth it still ingender in mens bosomes not only distracted but discontented thoughts, by reason it drives us from one imagination to another, without any manner of reall satisfaction in any thing we ei∣ther long for or desire▪ however self-interest and extraordinary passion to be contented, is the true cause of the disease in mens minds and dispositions. Of sloth, being another de∣pendant.But as Idlenesse may be said to be the bawd that inticeth the virgin-soule to all manner of sensua∣lity: so sloath must be esteemed the soft bed, where∣on whoredomes of that nature are daily committed. Slothfull persons may be compared to those dead bodies which the Divels are accustomed to carry in the ayre full of all putrefaction, that however they be not capable of acting themselves, yet by accident become instruments of horrid inchantments: such a creature cannot be better likened, then to a huge mountaine of earth, that containes hid in its bowels rich mines of Gold, which will not appeare but by the violent agitation of some extraordinary earth∣quakes that display the concealed treasure. In like manner, the bright faculties of a mans soule doe never appeare in a slothfull body, but when strange and unexpected chances cause them to remove by force. Confounded with this inclination, man see∣meth to have no further a journey to make but to his grave, since he is not onely altogether uselesse to others, but wholy buried in himselfe, not seeming any way to parcipitate of any of the active ele∣ments, but of clay onely, that is the last refuge for mortality. If God almighty had not intended man
for motion and exercise, according to his naturall capacity, it was to little purpose to have created a world for his dwelling, furnished with so many di∣versities of varieties for the practice of his reason; but might have cast him in some obscure place of small extent, there to have remained quiet untill the day of judgement, without either trouble or consideration. Certainly the Heathens were so out of love with this disposition, that the fortunate and wise Commonwealth of Rome not onely appointed a Censor to enquire after mens actions, that they should be good, but also to seeke into their vocati∣ons, that the might be alwaies conveniently im∣ployed. Truly I may say this is an humor of a most unhappy nature, since it is not onely of all others most unprofitable, but wonderfully unsafe to a mans future condition, for that every day it drawes him further off from vertue and religion, though it seems to give the best opportunity for contemplation. If we look at the practise of the age, we shall finde it abounds in most persons, being now the generall custome for women, not as in former times to pre∣vent the Sunne rising in their early activity; but rather to observe his setting, before they can be got out of their beds: and for young men, they are scarce carried in their thoughts to any manner of intention at all of activity, but where some perswa∣sion of luxury and sensuality leads them. The next imperfection I shall speake of,Of inconstancy another part of sensuality. is Incon∣stancy, that rather proceeds from the weaknesse of nature, then either from malice or custome. And however it may be thought onely to belong to mans
deceived and embroyled judgement, that makes him so often vary determinations, according to se∣verall objects presented before his fancy; yet we may say it comes also by reason of a kind of fearful∣nesse in a mans disposition, wanting a sufficient for∣titude to be confirmed against doubts, rising from too much apprehension; wherein for the most part the divell and the world are principall actors, for as the one strives to unsettle the understanding, by confused and bewitching fancies, so the other doth intangle peoples imaginations with too many re∣presentations of painted delights, so that often∣times they make choice of white fo Funerals, and black for Triumphs. Wherefore I say, it is most ne∣cessary for any person, that either pretends to Ho∣nour or Religion, not onely to be constant (provi∣ded his counsels be grounded upon profitable deli∣berations, without obstinacy or precipitation) but to put on such a noble fortitude in his resolutions, that he may be able to resist all temptations that are ready daily to make warre against his piety and re∣putation. Yet truly, I know many so flexible and inconstant in their natures, that they are not onely upon all occasions subject to be changed in their opinions (without any grounds or reason) by such as speak last with them, but for the most part are sot∣tishly led by the counsels and perswasions of people of a far lesse capacity then their own. Insomuch as in regard of this imperfection, they seem not at all to have any power over themselves and actions: When of the other side, perhaps persons of Honour and Religion, whose love they have sufficiently tried,
cannot procure the least confidence and beliefe in their thoughts: Which I can attribute but to the strange influence of the Planets in this unfortunate age, that makes people doe what is most against their own good, as it were by a certaine kind of in∣chantment of their senses and understandings, to∣wards depraved and preposterous actions. Last of all,Impatiency depending also upon sensuality I shall mention impatiency an imper∣fection also in my opinion which may be said to be∣long to sensuality, for that it proceeds from not being able sufficiently to suffer what he cannot help. The actions of an impatient person may be likened to those of a drunken man, that in his insensibi∣lities hath conceived some intention of opposition to this humour, and therefore in the high way be∣gins to quarrell with a bush of thornes; in which foolish contention he receives many pricks and scratches in his face and hands, without other re∣venge or satisfaction; or rather may be resembled to some barking Cur, that greedily runs after the stone that was cast at him, whereon by reason of his pre∣posterous violence he prejudiceth his teeth, instead of doing any injury at all to the subject or motive of his choler. But however this defect of nature may be charactered and esteemed, yet it is an im∣perfection of a most prejudiciall condition, since as it advanceth no mans profit and advantage: so of the contrary, it augments and increaseth every mans sufferings, leaving him for the most part unrelieved in his extremities, by rendring him incapable of counsell. Besides it is unpossible for any man to live with conveniency and safety in any ordinary con∣versation
of this world, without a competent pro∣portion of patience; since as the minde is subject to perturbation upon every slight occasion, so are new accidents and objects daily presented in this life, whereby there will be necessary occasions given to make use of temper; since both joy and sorrow are most commonly entertained in our apprehensi∣ons naturally with too much passion. For whosoe∣ver is in prosperity, seldome resteth without new ambitions; and they that are in adversity, most com∣monly make themselves worse, by not bearing their crosses with sufficient pacification. However there are not only several degrees in this imperfection, but divers kinds of impatiency: As for example, there are some wise and religious persons, that notwith∣standing they would constantly and resolutely un∣dergoe what martyrdome soever, yet are they so above measure precipitate in their studies, that they can scarce afford themselves leisure for any recreations, and by that means bring their bodies (if not their minds) into a most desperate condi∣tion of health; which can be interpreted no other then a want of patience in their natures, in not be∣ing able to waite with temper an ordinary conve∣niency, by reason of their over violent desire of ac∣complishing what they intend. Of the contrary again, there be others of a more inferiour courage, that having entred upon any designe in their reso∣lutions, give it over in the halfe way, meerly be∣cause they have not a competent patience to prose∣cute it to the end or period: which truly often∣times proves extream prejudiciall to a mans affaires
and reputation, since a man in so doing must be thought either to have begun unwisely, or to have left off inconstantly. But as these briefe descripti∣ons may be sufficient to bring into our remem∣brances the unruly and most dangerous passions of the mind, as well as the more grosse and disdainfull appetites of the flesh; from both which not onely proceeds the depravation of heavenly grace, that should keep reasonable man in the whole course of his life, but also takes from him in a manner all sense of honour and humanity: So must I again begin a new discourse concerning the nature and duty of morall conversation, not yet spoken of which seems to be so much neglected and adulterated in this unfortunate age, that men endeavour nothing but a false and deceiptfull kind of way in all their words and actions; as if truth were to be esteemed but a needlesse and contemptible decorum, onely to be observed by fooles living upon earth, or peni∣tents shut up in Monasteries. Against the pernicious and ignoble custome of Dis∣simulation. THe first generall corruption I will name shall be Dissimulation; unto which as I may say people are so inclined, that it is unpossible almost in any communication to know what another meanes, by
reason whereof there is scarce any content at all left in society, or almost a necessary confidence to be had in any thing that is said or done The first war that the divel made with God Almighty upon earth after his fall, was by dissimulation, whereby he en∣deavoured to corrupt man, to become a Rebell like himselfe; and prevailed so farre in this designe, that the Sonne of God was constrained to sacrifice his own person, to make up againe that great and unfortunate breach, whilst in the mean time, the Serpent had a temporall curse laid upon his condi∣tion, which was to creepe all the daies of his life on his belly, and to eate dust from the ground, to sig∣nifie ever after, he was to be esteemed the worst of creatures, onely because the divell had assumed his shape, to practice and put in execution his deceipt. Wicked Cain in the very infancy of the world used dissimulation in his accustomed Sacrifices, that drew down Gods anger upon him: which afterward made him become so impudent a reprobate, that he not onely against the rules of nature and humanity shed the blood of his innocent and vertuous bro∣ther, but was so unfortunately mistaken, that he even thought to have couzened God himselfe by his dissimulation, however he was invited to the ac∣knowledgment of his offence. Whereupon wee may conclude, that scarce can there be any crime of a high nature committed, but for the most part something of deceipt must accompany the action; and to shew how much God Almighty doth abhor all manner of falsification, he would not prosper the Jewes Army, or grant them any more Victories a∣gainst
their enemies, untill deceiptfull Achan was brought forth before the people to be stoned to death, and his goods consumed with fire; be∣cause he had concealed part of the Riches gotten in the City of Iericho, contrary to his commandement. We may also remember what desperate impie∣ties Saul contracted to himselfe, after he practised those deceipts against David, untill at last they brought him to be his own murtherer, whilst in the interim he possest his Kingdom whom he most hated and feared of all others. The Scribes and Pharisees, who were designed instruments for Christs death and passion (as we read) came to St. Iohns prea∣ching with false and dissembling hearts, amongst the rest of the multitude, which was the cause why he called them a generation of Vipers. Our Saviour himselfe most earnestly warned the people to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees, as fore∣seeing they would prosecute him to the very end, in the spirit of dissimulation and hypocrisie, not onely by often tempting him with deceiptfull que∣stions, but at the last act of his condemnation, in professing themselves servants of Caesars, to obtaine greater credit and beliefe, when as it was well known, they hated nothing more in the world, then to be under that jurisdiction; which was afterwards verified in their many rebellions. Iudas also began his wicked purpose in dissembling, when he mur∣mured amongst the rest at the losse of the sweet oyntment that was poured upon our Saviours head; pretending hypocritically, the cost had been better bestowed on the poore; though his intention was
onely, to have had the money at his own dispose, being purs-bearer; which covetous disposition of his sufficiently appeared, by betraying of his Master for so small a summe: And yet this man was so transported by the opinion of his own craft and subtilty, that when he was told particularly he had resolved in his minde to be the Traytor, he had nei∣ther wisdom nor grace to repent or be admonished; but of the contrary, went presently out of the room to execute his determination; to which purpose, a while after (being accompanied with a Troop of Souldiers) he bestowed upon his Master a trayterous kisse by way of salutation, the chiefe signe agreed between them, as a distinction for his more certaine and easie apprehension: Which shews that God Al∣mighty in detestation of this manner of sinne, is of∣tentimes pleased to give over such people to their own perdition, in the very spirit of ridiculous folly; not suffering them in any kind to reflect upon their own misery and impiety; as it were being drunke and infatuated by a certain overweening conceit, that they are by cunning and dissimmulation, able to deceive not onely men, but Heaven it selfe: Which no doubt was also the opinion of Ananias and Saphira, when they concealed part of the money from the Apostles; wherein appeared a most re∣markable judgement of God upon their persons: Yet not because they had no mind to have bestow∣ed so much to charitable uses, but for that after they had seemed to have given before the multi∣tude', they endeavoured again a dissembling way, to have couzened the expectation of their gift. For
it was plainly told them, that they might have cho∣sen at the first, whether they would have contribu∣ted or no, but they were undoubtedly punished in that they had lied to the holy Ghost, wherein they committed sacriledge, by reason of their intentionall deceipt. Truly if we reflect but upon the constan∣cy and suffering of old Eleazer in the Machabees, we may have by that martyrdome a sufficient example to instruct our beliefe concerning this duty; who ra∣ther then he would consent to the seeming onely of eating Swines-flesh (though in act he should not have been obliged thereunto) he chose to die a most cruell and violent death; as fearing else the scandall that might have risen thereby to young people of his Nation, to whom he desired to be a worthy and memorable testimony of goodnesse and piety. Muchlesse certainly ought we to premedi∣tate dissimulation, as an introduction to all our acti∣ons and designes, which is a custome now adaies so much in fashion, that I have observed it sometimes affected, without any intention at all of compassing benefits; but as it were onely to be esteemed wiser then other persons in worldly affaires; neverthe∣lesse oftentimes it doth of the contrary, destroy what is most coveted and desired, since it ingenders so much distrust between parties treating, that it is unpossible to have sufficient confidence of one ano∣ther to conclude almost in any thing to purpose; which is the reason generally, that there are so few differences of law and contention compremised; for each person according to his own secret inten∣tion of deceipt, believes the same thoughts are in
his adversarie, and so consequently feares to be couzened. O horrid custome, as I may say, and as much bewitched imagination, that thus perverts the institution of common society, to the depriving us of the greatest delight of mankind upon earth, in regard we cannot conveniently make use of our rea∣son and naturall knowledge, but must be forced to live with one another like ravenous beasts, alwaies watching either occasions to entrap, or seeking out waies to prevent: Whilst in the interim sweetnesse, affability, and security, are not to be expected by the good, and as little intended by the bad. But perhaps it may be thought, that notwithstanding these Scripture examples, Abraham who was one of God Almighties chiefe servants, seemed not onely intentionally, but actually to dissemble, when he affirmed Sarah to be his sister, whereas she was really his wife; unto which I answer, that as he was not bound to discover himselfe so farre to his enemies, whereby an eminent prejudice might have befallen his person, so of the other side, I am of opinion, that if the thing had not been also true which he aver∣red, in regard (according to the Jewes custome) she might be held his sister by reason of the neere kin∣dred and affinity between them, he could not have been altogether freed from the sin of dissimulation. For if the Text be considered, he did not deny her to be his wife, onely tacitely concealing it, but affir∣med her to be his sister, because she was so to be esteemed also by his Country lawes; which privi∣ledge he was content to make use of to saye his life, being in the hands of barbarous Tyrants. Besides
there appeared no intention in him to injure a third person, and therefore was at the more liberty to use his own discretion, without declaring an apparent untruth, which certainly he could not have done lawfully, though it had been to have saved his own life. There is no doubt but a man may in some sort deceive and couzen the expectation of thieves, and murtherers, by seeming sometimes one thing and doing another, in cases of necessity or conveni∣ency, without any manner of danger to his religion and honesty: however the common practice there∣of in triviall things in my opinion is naught; and not to be used for feare of the habit, that at last may render a man too insensible of failings in this na∣ture, whereby his nature is in danger to be brought by degrees to a kinde of falsnesse in conversation; that as I said before is a means to destroy all civill society, or confidence necessary to be expected in matters of greatest weight and consequence; and at the best it diminisheth love, abates charity, and destroyes friendship, which I may say are the chiefe ties belonging to humanity: Since there can be no indifferency in communication, where one party takes upon him a liberty to dissemble, and the other professeth all manner of freedome and integrity, both in words and intentions. But much more is this falshood to be abhorred, when it is practised with a trayterous heart to the ruine and destruction of innocency.
Of the breaches in conversation proceeding from the falsifying of words and promises. AS I have sufficiently demonstrated the incon∣venience of this custome of dissimulation, I must speak of those breaches in conversation, that proceed from engagements by word; which as I may say are certaine religious ties belonging to ho∣nour, whereupon depend for the most part the en∣trance into leagues and contracts, before they come to more absolute obligations; however without them it is unpossible to proceed to periods and con∣clusions, since words and promises must first passe, before intended agreements can any way be fini∣shed, depending meerly upon a noble faith; which is the reason that the word of a Prince and a Gentle∣man, hath been held in all ages in a manner sacred, and far more binding then prisons or writings; in regard it is to be supposed, that penalties belong unto the one, and nothing but a mans own honour obligeth him to the other, which makes a difference between us and inferiour creatures, who have chaines and other means ordained to keep them in order; whereas we ought to have no constraint but reason, and the freedom of the soule: wherein holy King David was so punctuall, that he would not himself put to death Shimei, who had most wickedly cursed him in his adversity, because he had promi∣sed
the contrary; However no doubt by some pro∣pheticall inducement, he advised his son Solomon to bring him to his grave with blood for his offences after his death. We finde that Ionathan observed his promises so inviolably to David before he was King, that neither regarding his fathers present an∣ger, or the losse of his own inheritance, he could not be brought to falsifie the least word that had passed between them. If we consider the wonderfull mag∣nanimity of Iepthes daughter, we may behold an admirable example left to posterity concerning this duty; for perceiving her most loving father had engaged himselfe (though rashly) to her destruction, whereat he seemed excessively afflicted, she bid him with constancy perform the execution, since (as she said) having opened his mouth to God, it was meet he should punctually fulfill his promise, without any consideration of her particular; and the more was this invitation to be admired, in regard it was unpossible she should be any way weary of her own life, being a beautifull young Virgin, and the onely childe of the chiefe Prince of the Countrey: Neither doe I believe the people of that age would have suffered Iepthe so lamentably to have sacrificed his sole daughter, without they had conceived it a most necessary thing to have all solemne promises & words given to be performed in every particular; and however this may be thought a vow, and there∣fore the more strictly to be observed, yet neverthe∣lesse it was but meerely voluntary at the first, with∣out any obligation exacted either by right or com∣mand: which made it differ no further from a bare
promise, but that it was better attested, in regard it was made before the face of all the people; by which meanes it could not be concealed (in respect of the ceremoniall part) though inwardly I conceive it no more binding to Iepthe, then if he had resolved upon such an action in his private chamber. But however it may be esteemed a greater obligation, what we promise to God, then what we assure to men, yet certainly among the very Heathens them∣selves, we shall finde a most punctuall observation of this common duty, which in a manner doth unite and tie together all morall and humane society; as may appeare by many examples in prophane Au∣thors. However I doe not believe their actions in this point were regulated by any of our rules of re∣ligion, but rather were carried on to the mainte∣nance of their honour, and the conservation of their faith by a certain gallantry and noblenesse ingraf∣ted in their natures and dispositions, by those prin∣ciples given them in their education and breeding, amongst the rest. There was a Roman Generall be∣ing taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and ha∣ving formerly promised all fidelity to the Senate of Rome, concerning the execution of his office and charge, for their best advantage: who continuing thus a Captive for some time amongst his enemies, at last they began to thinke his good usage and re∣leasment might produce some beneficiall effects to∣wards a peace, which they earnestly desired to make with their adversaries, by reason the Warres had exhausted their Treasure, and drawn their Com∣monwealth low in many other particulars; however
they could not conceal it from the knowledge of their prisoner. To which purpose having first con∣jured him to be their friend towards the obtaining of their wishes, they set him at liberty to return a∣gain to Rome with some Embassadours they inten∣ded to send with certain Propositions of amity and friendship; though with this Proviso, that if they should not obtain their desires, he was to promise them upon his honour, to render himself as before into their hands. The conditions being accepted, he went along with their Messengers, and being there arrived, contrary to their expectation, instead of perswading the Senate to hearken to any agree∣ment, he declared it to be their disadvantage and dishonour, to make any Peace at all with the Car∣thaginians, in regard of their enemies disabilitie to make longer war, assuring them he was sufficienlty informed of his relation, by many reasons and cir∣cumstances. So that this Oration absolutely broke off all manner of Treaty between the two Com∣monwealths, whereby either insued a new war, or at leastwise the continuance of the old; yet never∣telesse this brave and honest General, though he had exasperated and enflamed his enemies, by the faithful and profitable Counsel he had given his friends in Rome, returned again to Carthage accor∣ding to his promise and word given, there to be u∣sed at their discretion, which he was certain could produce no other effect, then to the taking away of his life in a most cruel manner: Wherefore being arrived, and a full relation of all the passages made in the open Senate by their Embassadours, he was
presently not onely seized upon with as much vio∣lence as their transported spleens could hasten their Officers to execution, but presently put to death, with all the exquisite torments could be devised by inraged and mercilesse people, that were deceived and cousened in their expectation. This act certainly exprest not only a world of magnanimity in his per∣son, but an intire noblenesse and truth in his dispo∣sition; as well concerning that faithful counsel he gave his friends and Country, to whom he concei∣ved himself obliged for his birth and employment, as in the punctuall observation of his words & pro∣mise, which he had given and made to his enemies, who he knew would revenge it to the uttermost of their power. In this manner did this brave Roman give a remarkable testimony to all posterity, what obligations are due in point of honour to words and promises. Now if this part of Morality, was ac∣customed to be so strictly observed amongst the Pa∣gans, having little or no Religion to regulate their actions, what may we conjecture of the duty of Christians, whose Professions are to serve the onely God of Truth, that without doubt can never be pleased, with any manner of falsifications; never∣thelesse we see this miserable age, is so far corrupted in this nature, as I may say, without any kind of ap∣prehension of honor, that it is almost grown a ma∣xime never to speak what a man thinks, or do what he sayes. But as I have mentioned this one example of a Heathen, I must also remember in this place another of a Christian, not onely of a memorable conse∣quence,
but the more to be regarded, for that it was chiefly grounded upon a religious duty. Which was that of Lewis King of France, surna∣med the Saint, when he made war in the Holy Land, who being in the like manner as the former taken prisoner by the Infidels, with most of his Nobility, at last by hard labour and with much difficulty, he made shift to contract for his Ransome and liberty, though at an excessive rate, yet esteemed better then to end his dayes in a miserable and horrid cap∣tivity. But when according to the agreement the mony came to be tendred, which was procured with difficulty from the estates and fortunes of his peo∣ple, the Commissioners whom he employed in the service, used such dexterity in their office and em∣ployment, that they over-reached the enemy in the account (though by no fraudulent deceit) where∣by they reserved a considerable sum to the Kings use, of capacity perhaps sufficient, to have defray∣ed a great part of the journey homewards; which being related to the pious Prince, with all the cir∣cumstances thereunto belonging. However, he was upon his departure, yet considering it might prove some scandal to his Religion, he resolved not to put to Sea until the full of the contract was per∣formed in every particular. And to that purpose, he not onely sent the residue of the mony to his ad∣versaries, but withal commanded his Treasurers in his name to excuse the Act, as done without his or∣der and privity. Which being exactly effected, & the Pagans fully satisfied, he joyfully took shipping with the rest of his company. Now though this pious
deed I must confesse, was beyond any obligation, yet in regard the contrary might have bred some jealousie and suspicion in the thoughts of the Sara∣cens, concerning the actions and intentions of this good King, whereby his Religion might have been dishonoured, certainly it may seem a most pious and laudable resolution; and truly cannot be but a worthy and admirable exemple, not onely to teach other Princes their duty, but also may serve in some sort to instruct all people, what considerations ought to be had in performance of promises; espe∣cially when they are made upon equal and just con∣fidence of both sides. For if this tye be not obser∣ved after a strict manner, there is no possibility left to be assured, either in contracts or conversation. Which is the reason that in the accidents and chan∣ces of war, souldiers after they are taken, often∣times are let go upon their words; however in pri∣sons, the same persons are perhaps kept by strong guards. Gamesters, who for the most part are men not to be secured by any Bonds and Writings, con∣cerning the payment of debts, yet when they bor∣row mony of their companions upon their words onely, for the most part will be sure never to break, as esteeming it a point of honor belonging to Soci∣ety and conversation, not to be violated by any means. Nay, very thieves are so punctual in this observation, that they will scarse deceive a person, whom they had determined to rob, if they have made any engagement to that purpose; and yet our poor Country, that was one famed beyond all other Nations in this particular, is now grown to that in∣famy,
by reason of this false way of conversation, that the people can neither be trusted by others abroad, or be at all confident of themselves at home. Concerning the breaches of trusts upon special confidence and obligation. THe next and last falshood I shall mention, is breach of trusts, when others put confidence in our truth and integrity; which was the crime of Architophel King David's esteemed Counsellour, who betrayed his Masters secrets to his unnatural son Ab∣solon, in which wickednesse and rebellion, they both miserably perished by the just judgement of Al∣mighty God. Again, we read that as Sampson was deceived by his wife, whom the Philistians had craf∣tily put upon him for that effect; so themselves were most remarkably punished by reason of their being Authors of the Treason; insomuch, as he destroyed most of the Nobility in his last end: And this was effected no doubt by the meer instigation of Hea∣ven, as a just reward for so unnatural a trechery, though withal I cannot deny, but that they were most pernicious people, and enemies to Gods wor∣ship. King David did so abhor this infidelity and breach of trust, that he put to death the young man, that brought him word of Saul's destruction, only for that he seemed to rejoyce in his Kings fall,
notwithstanding he himself was to enjoy thereby the Kingdome, without obstacle and hinderance. Also he slew the two Thieves Buana and Rechab, be∣cause they had killed trecherously Ishbosheth, howe∣ver he was not alone his mortal enemy, but sought the Crown from off his head; which justice he ra∣ther executed upon them, because they had been both Saul's servants. These certainly were not on∣ly religious demonstrations of a noble disposition, but testimonies of his opinion of this duty, when as he would not seem to countenance acts of so un∣worthy a nature, though himself was to reap the onely benefit. Moreover, he was so far in his own person from being unfaithful to Saul when he lived, that notwithstanding he alwayes persecuted him most spightfully for his life, he thought it a kinde of impiety to have cut a piece of his garment, though it were but to let him know he had him in his power, without doing him any other prejudice. But however Scripture examples are of best Au∣thority for our instructions,Alexanders de∣testation of falshood, and incouraging of loyalty. yet we may reflect a lit∣tle upon Heathen practises, as farther testimonies of morality. Amongst which number, we may consi∣der that Alexander the Great was so just and noble in his disposition, concerning this duty of trust, that when he understood Darius after his defeat was cru∣elly murthered by his chief Commander Bessus, he never left prosecuting of the wicked Traytor until he delivered him bound to the brother of the King, who executed him with many torments according to his deserts. When of the contrary, this gene∣rous Prince used those with all manner of honour
and repect, who had proved faithful and constant to their dead Master until his last end. For example, There was an old Nobleman of special trust about Darius person, who being brought to his presence, and not able to light off his horse, by reason of his age and many infirmities, he himself walked a foot conferring courteously with him in the sight of his whole Army, until perceiving the man something out of countenance to see the King in that posture, whilst himself rid, presently Alexander called for his horse to accompany him with more freedome and conveniency. Another act of magnanimity and justice, I shall mention of a Roman Consul,A brave ex∣ample of Ju∣stice. who having besieged a great Town in Italy, whereupon a trayterous and false Schoole-Master, that had most of the Noble youths of the City under his charge and care, think∣ing to make a benefit to himself of their persons, in that necessity one day leading the boyes into the fields, according to his custom, pretending onely their recreation; when he had them at a convenient distance for an escape, he suddainly (contrary to their expectation) brought them into the enemies Camp, and presented them with great joy unto the General as an acceptable service, deserving as he thought, both reward and commendation. But the Noble Commander reflecting upon the wickednesse of the fact, and false intention of the Master, as al∣so noting the dejectednesse of the countenances of so many youths of principal families, instantly gave order to have the fellow stript of his cloaths in his presence, causing also his hands to be bound behind
him; and being in this posture, he willed a good rod to be delivered to every one of the Scholars, commanding them to drive again their Trayterous Master into the City with whips and scourges, there to receive further punishment, according to the dis∣cretion of their injured parents. This truly was an act both of extraordinary justice and courage, since as he was willing to punish Treason, notwith∣standing the benefit might have redounded to him∣self if he had pleased, so of the other side, did he shew a bravery in his own disposition, that he would not darken the glory of his actions, by any such base wayes and means, though the opportuni∣ty was offered unto him. I shall remember one act more of justice, done by a person of the same Nation,Another exam∣ple in the like kinde. not differing much from the former in nature and manner. There was a certain young woman of birth and quality, who living in a Town that was besieged by the Romans, promised for a competent sum of gold, to deliver the place without any further trouble, in∣to the possession of the enemy, which being effected without any condition in the bargain made for her own life, she presently went to the General to de∣mand the performance of the contract, whereupon he commanded so much mony and other rich Jew∣els to be brought into the place, as had been promi∣sed for her recompence, where when she was ready to receive the possession of the wealth, according to the greedinesse of her appetite, who for such a gain had sold her friends, kindred, and Country, he suddainly caused the souldiers of his Guard, and to
cast it all upon her at an instant, whereby instead of enjoying the benefit of the riches answerable to her covetous expectation; she became intombed for her wickednesse and Treason, as a memorable sacri∣fice offered to right and equity. In this single act ap∣peared a double justice, The one in bestowing upon her what was promised, punctually to perform the a∣greement. The other in putting her to death for her crime, she not being priviledged by the Law of Arms from slaughter, in regard there was no condi∣tion made for her safety. These stories I mention to shew how hateful breaches of trust have been al∣wayes esteemed by Heathens and Infidels, when as the greatest and worst Tyrants were never willing to countenance acts of this nature. Witnesse in part, our Richard the third of Eng∣land, who however he promised the reward of a thousand pounds,Richard the third an enemy to trechery, though a Ty∣rant in his o∣ther actions. to that person that should bring forth the Duke of Buckingham, his esteemed mortal enemy, yet when he understood he was betrayed by Banister, one whose obligations to his Lord, should have made him trusty against all provokements by way of gratitude, if not fidelity, he not onely refused him the reward promised, but delivered this opinion of the action; that he that could dispence with his conscience, to deceive his trust concerning the pro∣tection of so good a Master, flying to his assistance in his necessity, it was unpossible but he would do the like with his King if it were in his power. Neither did God Almighty himself forbear the punishment of this unworthy wretch, as appeared by most re∣markable judgements not long after. For present∣ly
his eldest son fell mad, his second was drowned in a puddle of water, his onely daughter was strook with a most loathsome Leprosie, and himself in his declining age, was arraigned and condemned for Felony; thouh with much ado he was saved by his Clergy. All which, truly in my opinion, were ap∣parant testimonies of Gods anger against the nature of this base sin, since it cannot be conceived by any that lived in those times, that he was so punished in his family for other cause, then that he had betrayed that trust that was committed to him, grounded up∣on reasons of obligation and promise. Wherefore when I consider the strange kinde of breaches of trusts now a dayes, I know not whether I should more wonder that people are suffered to live by God Almighty, in regard of their falshood, or be scanda∣lized at their so little apprehensivenesse of their own intolerable basenesse in this nature; for it is generally noted, those who have been most obliged either by courtesies or duty, take the first occasion in these distracted times to prejudice other mens for∣tunes and estates. But however, according to my own opinion, I have spoke sufficiently concerning this duty in the general, yet I think it not amisse to declare some Divine, Natural, and Moral examples, belonging to two obligations in particular. Which are the ties of friendship and service, that have been in all ages held necessary ties to be observed: For without the first it is unpossible almost to be secure in any con∣versation, and being deceived in the latter, no per∣son can be well assisted in affairs appertaining to e∣very
mans condition, though I do not affirm they are alwayes to be practised in this high nature I shall mention; but presidents ought still to be of the best stamp and workmanship, left they be too slight∣ly imitated, and so consequently prove not profi∣table for those that have a mind to do well. The nature and property of entire friendship. WE will speak first of friendship contracted ei∣ther by nature or upon obligation, such as past between Ionathan and David, in the very infancy of their acquaintance, which was so in violably main∣tained and conserved by these two godly and No∣ble persons, that it seemed to weigh down all the considerations of humane and worldly concern∣ments; when as neither the competition of Crowns nor the losse of Scepters was able to work differen∣ces; but of the contrary, such a Religious sympa∣thy continued alwayes in their hearts, as if they had coveted more each others happinesse and prosperi∣ty, then their own. Neither certainly could this love and friendship proceed from Ionathan, out of any weaknesse of nature or want of valour, since he was known upon all occasions to expresse courage and shew wisdom, in matters of greatest difficulty and necessity. For however he had in his resoluti∣ons so wholly submitted himself to the will of God, that he was content to transfer his fathers kingdom
to David and his posterity, as appeared by the com∣pact made between them, wherein it was agreed, that he should have a care of his issue; yet in the last bat tail that was fought with the Philistins, he most valiantly sacrificed his own life in defence of his Country and Religion, to shew that notwith∣standing he expected no Dominion in his own parti∣cular, yet he would faithfully perform that office in the general, that belonged to his honour and Con∣science, concerning the just defence of the people. But for that it may be thought these actions pro∣ceeded chiefly from the inspirations of Heaven (as no doubt they did) I shall recount some more hu∣mane examples to shew, that this duty hath been e∣ver esteemed of a most high nature amongst Hea∣thens and Philosophers. To which purpose I shall mention this remarkable president of two Learned friends in the the time of Dionysius the Tyrant.A wonderful friendship ex∣prest in the time of Dionisi∣us the Tyran. The one of them being wrongfully accused by the Kings suspicion, had liberty notwithstanding given him to follow his occasions, upon security undertaken by the other, that if his friend did not return at the day appointed, to yeeld his body to the stroak of the ex∣ecutioner, himself should pay the forfeiture of his offence, by the same punishment. Whereupon he failing something of the time appointed for his ap∣pearance, his companion was brought out into the Market-place, to suffer death according to the a∣greement; but the other hasting to the place before the Executioner had done his office, and finding his dear friend in that posture, being so neer his destru∣ction, suddainly cast himself at the feet of Dionysius,
demanding his discharge, in regard he was ready as he said to be sacrificed to his indignation and cru∣elty. The other that was prepared for the slaugh∣ter, being desirous to redeem his friends life by his own losse, seemed not onely extreamly troubled at his appearance, but more perplexed a great deale at his offer, telling the Judge that now the limited time was expired, he conceived that none but him∣selfe was lyable to the judgement, and therefore accordingly expected the execution: Whereupon his companion being transported with the feare of his friends danger, conjured the tyrannicall King to consider, not onely with compassion, but some justice, that himselfe was the guilty person, and therefore it could not stand with the rules either of equity or humanity, that an innocent should suffer, when the faulty appeared ready to satisfie for the offence. The other also being in a manner beyond his senses, finding the King was inclinable to per∣form his friends request, in regard he seemed to have more reason in his pleadings, presently turned to the people, and desired their assistance in his re∣quest, alledging that his friend could not now justly suffer, for that himselfe had punctually contracted for his penalty and redemption. But whilst the strange and unexampled contention continued, to the no small amazement of the spectators, who could not but wonder at so rare and excellent a friendship, Dionysius himselfe after something a long pause rise from his seat, not onely pardoning them hoth their lives, but with all earnestnesse in∣treating them, to take him also as a third person,
into their admirable society and friendship, which he vowed he would esteeme as a principall honour and happinesse. In this story may be noted, not onely the wonderfull effects of an intire friendship, but the power of such examples, to soften the stony hearts of the most cruellest Tyrants in the world. Which shews, that even perversest natures may be overcome by those noble passions, though according to the practice of this age, these and the like rela∣tions may be esteemed no other then as ridiculous fancies, proceeding from extravagant inventions; but give me leave to say, that notwithstanding we are not bound upon all occasions to imitate these high presidents, yet certainly we are not to abandon all manner of good nature and friendship, dissolving every obligation onely upon interest & commodity without other consideration; since both divine and morall principles, meerly by the rules of charity and gratitude seem to challenge respects due from us to others, as well as to our selves. And our Saviour Christ, when he lived here upon earth, was so farre from disdaining this humane pas∣sion, that he seemed to love one Disciple above all the rest with a naturall affection. As I have related this remarkable example of constant friendship, so shall I in this place relate another of admirable love and affection, acted by a Heathen Prince, wherein he absolutely overcame his own earthly passions, meerly to satisfie his sons desires. An admirable example of love & friend∣ship in ano¦ther nature.There was a King raigning in Persia, who having married a most beautifull young Lady, it fortuned his sonne, a gallant and generous Prince, being ta∣ken
with her rare and excellent parts, fell of a sud∣den so excessively in love with his faire mother in law, that he had no power either to master his own passions, or to conserve so intirely as he desired, his former approved duty and obedience to his father; in so much as contending strongly for some time between these two extreames, at last, being wholy overcome rather by nature then reason he waxed sick, which by degrees increased so violently upon his constitution, that being able no longer to sup∣port the weight of his distemper, he was forced at last to yeeld to the perversenesse of his infirmity, and by that means within a few daies became past all hope of recovery, notwithstanding the skill and diligence of all the best Physicians of the Kingdom; which not onely dejected his father after an extra∣ordinary manner, but put the whole Court into a most desperate sadnesse; and the rather was their amazement encreased, by the opinion conceived of the strange fatality of his losse, since no art was able to dive into the conjecturall knowledge of his dis∣ease. However when all mens thoughts were not onely distracted, but at a stand, concerning this mi∣serable unfortunate accident, one Physitian amongst the rest, that was better knowing, or at least wise more diligent in his service, one day being present, perceived a wonderfull change, and alteration in the beating of his pulse, when the Queen entered into the room to visit her sicke sonne in law, in so much as at last by more carefull observation he be∣came certainly informed, that onely his hidden and secret love to the Kings wife, was the sole occasion
of his violent distemper; for that his bashfull and dutifull nature durst not own an affection against all lawes of humanity: Wherefore retiring himselfe into his chamber with these cogitations, to consult more freely with his thoughts, he concluded that it was unpossible to save the Princes life, without absolute satisfaction in his desires; and instantly he resolved notwithstanding any hazzard could befall him, to make the King acquainted with the discove∣ry of this mysterie, whom he knew had only power to save his son, since the Chastity of the Queen was no way to be attempted without his privity. In this perplexity, as I may say, he went presently unto the King, for that the least protraction threat∣ned destruction; where being come into his pre∣sence, he fell down at his feet, telling him in parti∣cular the condition of the young Prince, with all the circumstances thereto belonging; and humbly desired his gracious pardon, if he had any way of∣fended him in the relation, since it was no other then a duty he conceived he was bound to offer unto his Majesty, though his life were to satisfie the offence. The King having fully heard this unex∣pected discourse, not onely pardoned the Physitian, according to his desire, and commended him for his care and affection; but wished him also to be dili∣gent in other discoveries of the same nature. In this posture he presently went to the Queen, where after he had informed her (to her no small amaze∣ment) of all these strange passages, he violently conjured her by the duty of a wife, and the com∣passion of a woman, as also the affection of a
mother in law, to tender his sonnes life, who was as he said, both the hope of his Kingdome, and the comfort of his old age, which in particu∣lar was so far to obey his commands, that she would condescend to promise the Prince a fruition of her love, upon his recovery. The Queen being some∣thing distracted at these unusuall injunctions, not being able perfectly to discover the Kings minde, and lesse resolving in any kind to injure her own honour, stood for some time inwardly disputing with her own thoughts, untill finding by the Kings further discourses, that as he wished her no way to wrong her chastity, but onely seemingly to satisfie his son, whereby he might be freed from the dan∣ger of his present sicknesse; so was the least delay to the Princes expectation, no lesse then personall and present death. Wherefore after some other speeches and circumstances of the Kings, the Queen in a humble and gracious manner uttered this lan∣guage, That as her honour was more belonging to him then to her selfe, in regard of the dignity of his: calling, so would she have him to thinke, she ever tooke his commands to be the onely rule of her obedienec; however she hoped he would not en∣joyn her any thing that should be prejudiciall either to his Crowne or her owne modesty; with which confidence she promised to use both charity and di∣ligence towards the recovery of the Prince. In fine, after some time the King finding by this means, his son not onely to have past all hazzard & danger, but to have recovered much of his strength and beauty; though, as he was informed, he continued still the
same violent affection to the Queen, he caused a generall Proclamation to be made through his Do∣minions, as if he intended to sacrifice unto the gods for the safety of the young Prince. And to that purpose gave order, that upon a day appointed his Subjects should assemble, according to the custome of Persia, before his Palace gate, there to understand his further will and pleasure. The time being come, he was mounted upoon a glorious Throne, cloathed in all his Royall Robes, his beautifull Queen sitting of one hand, and the Prince his son of the other: where, after he had made a long and eloquent Ora∣tion in commendation of his Wives chastity, and his Sons vertues, whereby he put the people in minde of the losse they might have sustained by his death, he not onely in the face of the whole multi∣tude bestowed his Queen upon the Prince for his wife, but gave him also the present possession of many Kingdomes, as a Dower towards the better maintenance of their affections, to the joy and a∣mazement of all the Assembly. Now, I say, if this high act of magnanimity of a Heathen Prince be well considered, we shall finde a wonderfull demonstration both of his naturall goodnesse, as well as of his perfect friendship. For however it be not to be supposed, that a man for any pretence whatsoever, should give away his wife to satisfie anothers unlawfull passion, being against the rules of our Religion, yet there appeared in the carriage of the businesse, not onely an intire natu∣rall love, but a most constant and friendly affection, which no, doubt the young man had purchased
from his father, by his many merits, and other va∣luable considerations, that use to unite hearts; and so, as we may say, was strongly maintained in the thoughts and resolutions of that Noble Prince: for that he determined (as hath been related) without any manner of reflection upon his own particular, absolutely to throw away his greatest delights, rather then to hazzard or endanger his sonne; wherein he exprest more desire of conser∣ving the made love between them, then to satisfie in any way whatsoever his own appetites. Since to this purpose, he parted voluntarily with his beautifull and vertuous wife out of his own bosom, onely to be willing still to enjoy his friends conver∣sation, to be esteemed as he believed above all other happinesse. And however, as I said before, these strange examples are not to be used as presidents, for the directing of our morality, in that they are against the principles of our Religion; yet truly they may serve to give some testimonies reflecting upon the practises of these times, since most people seem to esteem onely private interest without any consideration either of faith, affection or good na∣ture. But to shew that even nature her selfe seems in unreasonable creatures to pretend to a certaine kind of friendship or gratitude upon many occasi∣ons, I shall make relation of one or two stories to that purpose, which notwithstanding they may ap∣peare in some sort past all beliefe, yet are they re∣corded for truths in authenticall and approved Authors. However put the case they are not true, yet may they serve as figures for instruction.
The story of Androclius the Roman slave.The first that shall be remembred is that of Andro∣clius the Roman slave, who being cruelly used by his master, fled into the Desart from his service; which was a crime almost esteemed of the highest nature in those times: after this flight he remained in a cave concealed for some daies, hoping thereby the better to avoyd the pursuit. However it hap∣ned in the interim, that a huge Lyon entred the place where he was, who having by some accident gotten a thorne in his foot, and perceiving the man there, he presently fell at his feet, as if he desired re∣life at his hands; whereupon the fellow after some amazement and feare, perceiving at last his inten∣tion, and glad of the occasion, undertook cure; which he might more conveniently performe, in re∣gard he had brought along with him many neces∣saries fit for such a piece of service, in that he was accustomed by those instruments to heale his own sores received from the scourges of his passionate master; by whose care and industry within a short space the Lyon became not onely reasonably well recovered of his wound, but daily went abroad into the Forrest, as well for his own sustenance, as to provide also meat for his Physician; which continu∣ed them both in that posture and society, untill the slave either weary of that uncouth conversation, or desirous to save himselfe by a further flight, took a resolution to part from the cave; however in the execution of his purpose he proved so unfortunate, that he was again taken and brought to Rome, there to be devoured by wild beasts in the publique Theatre before all the people, as a judgement con∣ceived
answerable to his crime. But being exposed upon the day appointed to the fury of a huge Lyon, that seemed ready prepared with open mouth to re∣ceive him, of a sudden to the amazement of the spe∣ctators, instead of tearing him presently in pieces (as he had done many before) he cast himselfe at his feet with a fawning countenance; whereupon instantly enquiry was made after the reason of such a sudden change, since lately he had shewed himselfe more furious then all other beasts of his kind. But the slave being examined in many particulars, as if he had used some inchantment towards the Lyon, he declared the whole story of his flight, and of his en∣tertainment in the Cave; where he cured, as he said, the Lyon of a hurt he had got in the foot; for which act of gratitude, as was conceived, the beast had con∣tracted some friendship with his person, that as yet appeared not to be out of his remembrance; since he had exprest it in as high a way as could be ima∣gined towards his preservation. All which being believed of the people, the poore slave was not only pardoned his life, but his freedom was also granted him by his master, as a fitting reward for so strange an accident. Another I shall also mention, though not after the same manner, yet may be esteemed of the like quality, onely the difference is, the one contracted friendship out of gratitude and obliga∣tion, the other meerely by a secret instinct of na∣ture. There was a young boy,A strange re∣lation of a boy and a Dolphin. who was accustomed of∣ten as he went to Schoole, to passe along the Sea∣shore of Bayea, where there used to frequent a great
Dolphin, being esteemed generally the King of fish∣es; untill at last there became such an acquaintance and familiarity between these two creatures, that the fish ordinarily would take bread and other things out of the childs hand, as also come at the sound of his voyce, when he called him; sometimes carrying him a mile or two on the Sea; and after he had sported and played with him there a while, would set him again on land, and suffer him to de∣part. Which custome continued untill the boy by some accident hapned to die; however the Dolphin notwithstanding daily resorted to the place, as it were to enquire after his companion whom he mist; but at last finding he was absolutely deprived of that society, having (belike) no hope to see him a∣gaine, he violently cast himselfe upon the sands and died, as it was supposed meerly for griefe and ap∣prehension of his losse. Which story, however I cannot affirme for certaine, yet Pliny relates it as a truth from many writers: but neverthelesse taken onely for Romancy, it may serve sufficiently for my purpose, which is to convince people by such in∣ducements that the bands of friendship ought not to be broken upon any condition, without impiety & dishonour; whenas unreasonable creatures meer∣ly by the instinct of nature, have observed these ties, in so much as men have been amazed at their grati∣tude and constancy. But now, since it may be thought I have been something tedious upon this subject, or rather duty so little esteemed in these daies, I will come to the last fidelity, which in truth is a great deale more necessary to be observed then
then the former, in regard of the daily use thereof upon all occasions: which is to consider what trust may be thought convenient according to the pra∣ctice of other ages, from servants to their patrons. The nature and obligation of service. THis tye of service certainly is grounded both upon divine and morall principles: And our Sa∣viour seemed himselfe to complaine most bitterly, that none but he which had eate his bread should be designed to lift up his hand against him. As much to say, he of all others should not have been the man chosen out for the treason. We read in holy Scrip∣ture that Abraham not only conjured his servant by a certaine kind of a curse, by reason of those obliga∣tions, which were due from the nature of his con∣dition, being one of his family to be faithfull, when he sent him to seeke a wife for his son in the Coun∣trey of Mesopotamia; but also this godly and good natured person himselfe was so punctuall in obser∣ving his Lords commands, and fulfilling with expe∣dition his expectation, that he could not be perswa∣ded (notwithstanding the occasion was extraordi∣nary, and the intreaty most powerfull) to stay any longer then one night in the house of Bethuell Re∣beceas father, in regard of the speciall care was in his affectionate heart, to give his Master speedy satis∣faction
in his imployment, according to his concei∣ved duty. Neither truly it is to be supposed, that Ioseph being intertained onely by a Heathen King, would have been so above measure advantageable in the execution of his office, in buying of all the Land of Egypt to his Lords proper use, but rather have made a benefit of his prophesying spirit, to∣wards the enriching of himselfe and friend, if he had not thought it at leastwise a morall obligation belonging to his charge. We read that the Angell that accompanied young Tobit in his journey pro∣mised an extraordinary care and diligence in his behalfe, being hired thereunto; which truly in my opinion may be taken as a figure or example of ser∣vice. However there were other high mysteries contained in that speciall progresse ordained by God Almighty. Furthermore in this morall duty the Turkes are so punctuall in conserving all man∣ner of trusts, that the very souldiers themselves that are accustomed to wait upon travellers for wages, wil not in their own persons do them any manner of injury, but rather defend them with a most constant violence from all such affronts intended them from others; to which purpose I shall in this place make relation of a remarkable passage, to this effect. A relation of a Turkish soul∣dier.Some yeers since there was a company of English men travelling in Turkey, to informe themselves of the curiosity of those Countries; & to that purpose for their better defence, they had hired three or four souldiers to be their guard, whereby to prevent all affronts and injuries that might be offered to
their persons amongst the barbarous Arabians; in which office (as I said before) they are extreame faithfull and diligent. However it so hapned, that one of our Countreymen having belike drunk more then was convenient, either for his present commo∣dity or appearing safety; and by that means com∣mitted many extravagant and most ridiculous inso∣lencies in his journey, untill at last he fell violently upon his own souldier, not onely with abusive lan∣guage; but also in his madd choler gave him many blowes, whereat the company was something asto∣nished as well as displeased; and the rather for that notwithstanding he pursued the fellow in a most furious manner: yet the discreet & patient Janizary was so far from revenging the injury, that he onely endeavoured to avoyd his strokes by flight. But at last the businesse being composed, and the quarrell taken up, the souldier was demanded by some of the company, how he could possibly endure such affronts and injuries from a stranger; especi∣ally when he was in his power, and under his pro∣tection. Whereupon he presently answered, that however he was abused by anothers insolency and indiscretion, yet in regard he had been hired with money to be faithfull in his office, he himselfe would not commit so great a wickednesse, as any way to deceive his trust by anothers example; but was resol∣ved rather to suffer more prejudice personally, then to be injust in his own duty. By which very act we may perceive, what opinion the Turkes have of this obligation of service, being contracted for in any kind, believing, as it should seem, there depends
upon this duty not only a tye of trust and diligence, but of humility and sufferance, whilst they remaine under that condition. Other examples to this effect might be brought almost in all ages, to shew the na∣ture and practise of this obligation, when as con∣temptible slaves have not onely oftentimes refused liberty and preferment, but have bit out their own tongues upon occasions being tormented, rather then they would accuse their masters; by that means, as it were depriving themselves of the capa∣city to reveale their secrets in any kind. Others a∣gain in the warres have exposed their naked bodies to the fury of weapons and darts, when they per∣ceived their masters person in eminent danger, only to save them from slaughter and destruction; offe∣ring their own lives as affectionate sacrifices, to ex∣presse the better their entire love and fidelity. It is recorded in some stories, that Leeimachus one of Alexanders souldiers continued so faithfull to his master the King, that however falling into his dis∣pleasure, for relieving of the Philosopher Calistines in his necessities, contrary to his command, he was con∣demned singly to encounter a Lyon; yet when the King was in danger to be lost, being out of his way in a vast Desart, he runne a foot by his horse side a whole day together, to the hazzard of his own life, until he had brought again him safe unto the Army; which act of courage and fidelity procured him so much favour from Alexander, that he became at last of such eminency, that he proved one of those Cap∣taines that after the Kings death had in a manner the World divided between them. Neither can
we but wonder at the strange examples of fidelity that are daily produced amongst the Indians; which opinion as it should seem hath been so ingrafted in their natures and practises, arising onely from their rude principles in religion and morality, that we know it hath been the ancient custome, if not at this day, in many places, to cast themselves in the fire with the bodies of their dead Lords, there also to be consumed; as if they thought it either an essentiall point belonging to their duty, or an un∣doubted part of their happinesse to accompany them in another world. But for a more neerer te∣stimony of their naturall trust and affection, we may reflect upon the relation of the businesse of Am∣boyne, wherein some Iapan servants endured most intolerable torments by the Dutch, because they would not accuse their English masters. All which in my opinion are apparent evidences, either by the light of nature, or from some customary principles in religion or morality, even barbarous people con∣ceive a certaine duty belonging to those that tye themselves to such a condition. However for the most part servants of this age, are so farre from per∣forming their duty in this kind, that they doe commonly designe themselves under such a condi∣tion, but onely for their own pleasures and commo∣modities; as if there were no other obligations to be performed, then to be called servants: And yet perhaps at last will violently presse for rewards, when as at best their service never merited one sin∣gle yeers wages: which indeed makes the gover∣ning of families almost intolerable; though I must
confesse masters also may be sometimes deficient in their own obligations. But I will conclude this discourse with a story of a poore woman, notwith∣standing her sex might have been excused, in shew∣ing forth such testimonies of magnanimity and fide∣lity, which story relates much after this manner. The strange fidelity and wonderfull suf∣ferings of a poor woman∣servant.When that most wicked and bloudy Tyrant of the World, the Emperour Nero put on a resolution to marry Popea, it was thought something necessary by his favourites to forge false accusations against his lawfull wife Octavia, not onely in regard of the nobility of her blood, and extraction, but for fear lest the people might be overmuch scandalized at the action; to wch purpose a mayd-servant of hers being brought to the Rack, before Tygellinus that infamous and cruell bawd; after many furious and intolera∣ble torments, which she suffered in defence of her Ladies chastity and honour; at last she was deman∣ded by that inhumane monster something concer∣ning her mistresses deportment in uncivill tearmes, not becomming the modesty of her womanly eares to heare, or her bashfull tongue to answer: however being violently prest notwithstanding unto a direct and present reply, she told him in some passion that her Ladies secret parts were farre more chaste, and free from corruption, then his mouth; and in this conflict yeelded up her life to their cruelty, as a te∣stimony of Octavias innocency. By this magnani∣mous suffering may be noted the extream fidelity of this poore though couragious wench, who was so farre from betraying her mistris, that in the very heat of her torments she rather chose to exasperate
the malice of those Tyrants, to her further punish∣ment, then she would endure to hear so much as one dishonourable passage to be mentioned, that con∣cerned the dignity of her Ladies person, as I may say, disdaining that so much as one uncivil or unbe∣seeming word, should be spoke that concerned her honour, though at that time she was forced to enter∣tain such a combat as might have gained the victory over the stoutest and most couragious men, that ever yet breathed. Which being considered in each par∣ticular, may be thought extraordinary effects of that love and duty that belong to the condition of ser∣vice; for however she could not without some im∣piety accuse innocency, though many by meer force of tortures have been constrained to it in their own cause, yet if she had not been so much transported with her affection to her Mistresse, by which means she apparently exasperated her Judges, she might probably have obtained more favour or lesse rigour in her own behalf and concernment, wherein con∣sisted the chief magnanimity of the action. But as I have now briefly run through these extra∣vagancies of nature, and corruptions of manners, from whence probably proceed all humane wicked∣nesse, whereby people are carried on for the most part to be unjust to others, and injurious to them∣selves; not onely against Religion belonging to God, but even contrary to morality appertaining to men and conversation. So of the otherside, ought we to expect by the exact rule of justice, after this life either punishment or reward, according to our comportments in these particulars, which however
it be a principle most believe in the general, yet per∣haps many may not seriously enough reflect upon the true consideration of their qualities, for if they did but apprehend the punishment and rewards with a competent understanding belonging to good and evil, it were impossible upon every slight occa∣sion, to be carried away so much with preposterous practises, as experience in this latter age tells us men are. Wherefore, that we may come somethidg neerer our thoughts, by a collection of some circum∣stances of these particulars, as the Church of God tells us there is a Hell and a Heaven, which must by consequence follow, if there be a God and a Devil; so may we in a sort measure out their natures and properties, by some humane descriptions and com∣parisons, although in no other manner, then the twilight resembles the day, or the least star in the firmament the bright Sun. And first we will begin with Hell. Some kinde of demonstrations of the supernatu∣ral torments of Hell. TIs true, as I have intimated already, notwith∣standing it be unpossable to comprehend suffi∣ciently the intollerable torments of this infernal habitation, by the meer apprehension of man, that proceeds no further then humane capacity, when as
these infinite miseries being instituted by Almighty God in the greatest fury of his wrath, must needs be spiritual, and consequently supernatural, to satisfie his judgement, wherefore neither confined to place nor subject to mitigation, yet being computed with worldly sufferings, we may in some sort he sensible of their effects, if not of their natures and qualities. For which purpose let a man but set before his con∣sideration and apprehension the miserable conditi∣on of a person cast into a deep and dark Dungeon, without hope of redemption, full of nothing but horrid dispaire and stinking vapour, there to have his naked body laid upon a broiling Gridiron over a most sulpherous and scorching fire, whilst his ten∣der flesh by piece meals, should be continually torn from the bones by hot pincers, with all the violence and cruelty that could be imagined; whether or no it can be supposed that this miserable wretch would not redeem his deplorable captivity if it lay in his power, with the greatest pennance and austeritie, that were ever yet suffered upon earth by any mor∣tal creatures; however, these punishments were on∣ly designed for some few yeers: so that let what man soever consider but the shortnesse of humane life in this world, wherein any thing can be acted or suffered by an equal estimate, and then tell me whe∣ther that person be not a most intolerable fool that seems so bewitched with momentary & painted de∣lights, that he cannot in any kind reflect upon those torments that shall neither be confined to him, or can admit of any manner of comparison; for if all the tortures that were ever yet invented by the
most cruellest and subtilest Tyrants, were to be laid upon a sufferer, with the greatest art and violence could be devised, to cause despair and increase affli∣ction, yet were they no more to be esteemed in re∣gard of the infernal torments then the least biting of a flea is to be compared to those punishments we have mentioned, though executed, as I say, with what worldly power soever; or then is the ordinary fire we use, to be likned to the Suns brightnesse, or the lightnings effect that in an instant, procures both fear and amazement; Since we must expect the tor∣ments in the other life, to be so far from being un∣derstood, or comprehended by any humane imagi∣nation, that they are created not onely by God Al∣mighties omnipotency, not a natural way as earthly things are, but as it were in the very spirit of his in∣dignation against sin, that is more opposite to his Majesty a million of times, then light is to dark∣nesse. For as we must suppose them ordained, onely to prosecute a divine vengeance, never more to be pacifyed by what mediation soever, and as lit∣tle the Executioners to be won to any manner of compassion: so ought we to be assured, that both soul and body shall endure, not onely one common and particular torment, but multitudes of every kinde, answerable to each nature. For as the soul shall be continually tormented with the thought of that loss it hath sustained, being debarred from Hea∣ven, and being brought into a most despairing con∣dition, never to be redeemed by any care or endea∣vour, so shall every sense of the body and member a part be sensible of distinct punishments, as well as
of the whole, though each insufferable in every particular, and yet not withstanding must be endu∣red altogether without either relaxation or inter∣mission. As for example, our eyes will be deprived of all light and faculty of seeing, and yet neverthe∣lesse must be continually frighted, with most ugly and horrid visions of all sorts that can work terrour in a bodies apprehension. Our hearing likewise, although absolutely obstructed and deaf, as to any discourses of pleasure and consolation with other tones of harmony and delight, yet shall we conceive alwayes to apprehend in our imaginations, most ter∣rible cursing, howlings, and other distastful lamen∣tations of tortured persons. The smell in like manner, however of no use to our benefit and commodity, yet shall remaine alwayes suffoca∣ted and choaked with stinking corruptions of suf∣ficient power to poyson whole worlds of people. Our taste, though continually glutted with loath∣some superfluities in every kinde, yet notwithstan∣ding shall we indure most outragious hunger and thirst, to the very appetite and violent desire of eat∣ing and consuming of our own bowels and intrails, for want of food and nourishment. And for our feeling, we shall need no more comparison, then per∣fectly to reflect upon either those torments we have already mentioned in this Discourse, or seriously to consider what is possible for people to suffer, either by fire, sword, scourges, or the like; by the cruelty of what Tyranny soever without intermission. However, as I have said before, all earthly tortures are no more to be compared with Hell fire, then a
man lying warm in his bed furnished with all de∣lights is to be esteemed miserable, like him who be∣ing flead of his skin is presently cast into a frozen pool to be tormented to death with cold. For the fire which is to be punishment to the damned, hath three properties, as I may say, infinite in their na∣tures, violently tending unto the unhappinesse of men condemned by the Majesty of God. The first is, that it can never be extinguished by what art or power soever. The second, that it shall never waste it self for want of matter to work upon, or at all consume the subject of its fury. And the third is, that it shall be no way limited in effect, being as may say, infinitely vigorous. So that we may conclude those flames to be powerful without resistance, last∣ing without end, and violent beyond sufferance. Besides, it hath no manner of affinity at all, with any kinde of comfort or consolation, much lesse is it constituted to delight sense, or please apprehen∣sion. For it burns in darknesse, it scorcheth with∣out warmth, and continues without use. Where∣as those fires we have upon earth, are but hurtful onely according to accident and application, for however, they prejudice sometimes our persons, and hinder our commodity, yet in the interim they af∣ford a certain kinde of content and satisfaction in being perceived, the nature thereof being of a plea∣sant aspect at the worst. And notwithstanding they often destroy and consume with no small violence, yet at that very time, they contribute something of commodity to the beholders, either by reason of warmth or light, which are properties delightful
naturally to our humane senses; whereas those black and unperceived flames of Hell, are not made capable at all of any manner of beneficial quality, as being wholly and infinitely intended by the ex¦sperated justice of Almighty God, for affliction and punishment▪ So that if people would but seriously consider these fearful particulars, and withal how little able mens bodies are in this world (according to the custome of this luxurious age) to endure any extraordinary hardnesse (when for the most part we seem passionately sensible of the least aking of a tooth, bein ready to confine our selves to our beds for a small defluction of Khume) me thinks the ve∣ry apprehension of what may befal our condition in the other life, should make us perfectly fick in∣deed, though I do not say, of dispair, yet of profi∣table considerations, whereby either to perform austerities, or restrain vices; Again, if naturally we cannot brook the sight onely of tortured persons in this world chastised for their misdemeanours, by a certain kinde of antipathy against blood and cruel∣ty; how shall we be able to suffer the torments of Hell both in body and soul, when as God himself is the Judge with a frowning brow, being an injured Majesty, and the devils the executioners full of un∣speakable malice towards mankinde, in being ex∣alted into their places, which they will be sure ever to remember with advantage, when their power shall be no more circumscribed and limited in that particular. O stupendious misery without bounds limits, or end! Which however, by the opinion of most Divines, shall be increased by the very know∣ledge
& memory we shall retain, in concerning how unfortunately we were deprived of the sight of God, by reason of nothing but our own foolish negligen∣ces, when we had the happy means so conveniently and lovingly offered us by the passion of our most blessed Saviour; who certainly, as it may be concei∣ved, would not have dyed and suffered for us, if the prevention of these horrid torments, had not been of a most infinite consequence to our avail. Besides, we may in some sort measure the nature of the torments in Hell, not onely by the devils cruelty, but by their ugly shape and deformity; since as it is believed, if a man could but see one of them in his proper co∣lours and horrour of his Office, it were unpossible to live after it one minute; much more what an un∣speakable terrour to be in the company of many millions of them for multitudes of lasting ages, e∣specially, as I said before, having obtained an abso∣lute jurisdiction over our persons, neither to be re∣deemed by any mor industry, or their cruelty to be asswaged by any compassion or intreaty. And these torments and horrours, no doubt, will be amplified and augmented in a most high kinde, by that terri∣ble and bottom lesse despair, that shall continually possesse and afflict our thoughts, as well in concei∣ving the present miseries we suffer, as in fully ap∣prehending we shall never enjoy a better condition. And yet notwithstanding, we shall be so far from procuring any the least consideration from Heaven in our behalfs, that as the Devils will perpetually insult and triumph over our persons and afflictions, so shall the justice of Almighty God, alwayes from
his Throne of glory, put us in minde of those faults for which deservedly we endure all our intolerable punishments, as it were by that means returning our curses and blasphemies upon our heads, to our greater shame and torment, which our desperate condition would willingly cast up at the Majesty of Almighty God. Neither will it be our smal∣lest misery (though all is infinite and bound∣lesse) to behold with the eyes of our tormented soule the strange darknesse of the place, wherein we are imprisoned for ever, being of a most narrow capacity and extent, and yet filled with so many horrid confusions of all sorts, without any distincti∣on in the least kind, that can pretend to variety; in so much as it may be resembled to the worlds Chaos before the creation, though much more ugly and deformed. All these excessive, boundlesse and in∣comprehensible miseries (I say) we doe more then hazzard to undergoe, onely because we cannot finde in our hearts to forbeare the violent carreere of all passions and affections in every thing. However without doubt enjoyed any way in the greatest per∣fection can be devised in the world, and most agree∣ing with naturall sense and appetite, yet in effect they will prove but like the seeming beautifull apples, growing upon the bankes of Sodome, which being gathered containe nothing within them but dust and ashes. Nay further, I dare boldly and with confidence affirm, that men for the most part undergoe more labour, paines and vexation, both in minde and body, in procuring their own damna∣tions, then others (that make earthly things more
indifferent in their desires) doe in purchasing the joyes of Heaven. Wherefore I must conclude those persons to be wonderfull strange creatures, that continue in so stupid a madnesse, incompassed about with such infinite hazzards, onely to maintaine the possession, or I may say rather an appetite to pur∣chase those things, which truly in themselves well considered, are not at all essentiall to any manner of apprehension or fruition; which infallibly demon∣strateth that mans faith is defective, or his judge∣ment not competent, since either he must not be∣lieve what the Church and Scriptures tell him, or wants ability in his nature truly to comprehend the valew and waight of such principles; and in this respect may be said to resemble the foot (or ra∣to exceed him in insensibility) that chose to be a King onely for one yeere, and afterward all daies of his life to endure nothing but hunger, beggery and misery. For certainly as mans continuance in this world is no more to be thought of in comparison of eternity, then one yeere to be valued with the longest age; so are all the afflictions upon earth that were ever yet endured by flesh and blood, no more to be esteemed with those torments of Hell, then dreams are to be reckoned with realities. Neither in truth can they admit of any manner of humane simi∣litude. But now that we have brought into our remem∣brance some kind of representation of these fearfull expectations, from the severe justice of Almighty God, his Majesty being exasperated against sinners, we will a little endeavour to sweeten these appre∣hensions,
by some estimats of those blessings which his mercy hath prepared in Heaven for his friends. However they are much more difficult to be descri∣bed then the torments of hell, by reason the soules fruition chiefly consists in speculation, that is in be∣holding the beatified vision of God with know∣ledge and security, which, as I may say, is not at all to be comprehended by our humane senses, and little more by the conceptions of our soule, being accompanied with the body unrefined: Which was the cause that Mahomet onely instituted a Paradise of sense, more probably to take the appetites of his Disciples and followers; craftily conceiving, that if he should have preached to them such high myste∣ries, and promised to them rewards past their capa∣cities naturally to conceive or apprehend, it would have quickly beat down the new foundation of his wicked building; since the common people might not have been so ready to have followed his entice∣ments, and entertained his doctrine: For truly hid∣den and supernaturall things are not so plausible to humane nature, as such as are more visible to the eyes, eares, and fleshly senses, which seem better to perswade common and not illuminated understan∣dings. Neither is it possible to procure a compe∣tent proportion of this illumination necessary to salvation, without some speciall grace first purcha∣sed from Almighty God; gained, as I may say, by our earnest desires, and diligent endeavours to serve him both with our hearts and actions, according to the Churches directions. But now to our purpose concerning our heavenly representations.
The wonderfull properties, and infinite felicities of Heaven in some sort described, according to humane apprehension. AS Heaven certainly was ordained by Almighty God, for the comfort and felicity not onely of his good servants, but for the further declaration of his Majesty and glory, so may it be very well sup∣posed, to be the prime piece of his creation, when as it is illustrated, as I may say, by his own presence that could not be created, and he being wonderfull and omnipotent in all his works, no doubt hath appointed that celestiall mansion, to be fully re∣plenished with all manner of satisfactory varieties and beauties beyond any kind of conception: For if we with our naturall eyes cannot behold the Sun, without amazement; especially when we consider and know it to be by evident demonstration above a hundred times bigger then the whole earth, shi∣ning and casting his light in such an admirable manner, to the benefit of the whole world, and yet must be at last changed or brought to nothing, as a contemptible creature, onely for a time made for mans use and commodity, without any manner of intention of eternity, what may we thinke of that refulgent habitation, where God himselfe hath pla∣ced
his Throne, not onely to endure for ever and ever, but where he hath designed particularly his glory, goodness and omnipotency, to be worshipped and adored in a full and open prospect by us after the clouds of our fraile nature are dispersed from before our soules view, that darken her light and understanding, whilst she walkes here upon earth cloathed with flesh and blood. O that it should be possible that people can be taken with the repre∣sentations of dainty maskes and the like, where onely fained Gods seem to be drawn in golden Cha∣riots through the ayre, in which entertainment oftentimes our senses are so transported, that in our hearts we could wish to enjoy no other happi∣nesse but to be alwaies in such company, where de∣licious gardens and fountaines might still afford our appetites varieties of earthly pleasures, and yet when any discourses are offered to our eares of these supernaturall and incomprehensible delights, both certain and permanent, we appeare altogether, as it were dead and insensible of the least apprehension of such perfections. Alasse, how we may perceive our selves to be overcome but with the reading of idle Romances; or hearing other stories that tell us with a world of fictions of admirable places of pleasure, wherein remaine nothing but Nymphes and Ganemedes. Yet when we understand these true beatitudes to be described in Scripture, and set forth by other religious Authours, they seem not at all either to move our desires, or stir our appe∣tites. The reason of which I say is nothing but a certain kind of stupidity, engrafted in our dispo∣sitions
by custom, in regard we have not procured so much grace from Almighty God (for want of diligence in his service) as should cleare our mentall speculation, and elevate our soule to our proper sphere, there to converse knowingly: for such reli∣gious persons as have in a manner any way morti∣fied themselves to the world, I dare be bold to af∣firme, take more delight and felicity in one heaven∣ly rapture, then we can possibly in a thousand of these fantasticall imaginations that doe but leave the soule darkned in her understanding, without any reall satisfaction at all enjoyed. But let us come as neere as we can by sense to the apprehension of these heavenly excellencies, as I may say, by naturall and humane comparisons, since it is unpossible altogether to shake off the appetites of this grosse clay, that will downward doe what we can▪ especially leading our manner of lives. To this purpose we will begin first with the wonderfull extent of Paradise, being certainly one of the chiefe properties belonging to the beauty of any place or habitation; for which effect we may reflect upon the consideration of the round ball of the earth, being of no penurious dimension, to be covered over with a large and vast Canopy of what matter we know not, though most admirably contrived; and besprinkled clean through with multitudes of bright Starres, some equalling the whole world in greatnesse, and yet seem to possesse in a manner no place at all in the firmament; by which comparison we may in some sort give a roving conjecture of the hugenesse and capacity of the Heaven of Hea∣vens,
wherein God Almighties chiefe glory is pla∣ced; which is so farre above all these transitory Spheres both in height and greatnesse, that we may imagine it to increase, as one circle doth within an∣other from this lower Heaven, untill it come not onely unto an unmeasurable, but an unconceivable vastnesse and infinity. So that without any more dispute we may very well conclude, that the Para∣dise of the blessed is great, without limitation; and so consequently must exceed all proportion answe∣rable to mans conception. The next benefit that may be thought to belong to this glorious habita∣tion is Clarity, which certainly is so exceedingly illustrious in this place beyond expression, that as we may suppose the whole frame of the Heaven to be made of a transparent and Chrystalline matter, so is every soule therein remaining qualified or ador∣ned with a particular light or shining, according to the degree of its happy estate, which neverthelesse in each doth exceedingly out-doe the brightnesse of the naturall Sunne in his greatest splendour. For that Planet, however created with admirable pro∣perties for mans commodity, yet being not ordai∣ned for eternity, the effects thereof cannot be per∣fect in any kind, because it selfe wants also an abso∣lute perfection in nature. Wherefore putting toge∣ther so many excellent lights, wonderfull in bright∣nesse, and delightfull in aspect, what may we con∣ceive of the glory of the Celestiall habitation? e∣specially when the refulgent rayes, proceeding from the blessed countenance of every Saint and Angell, can reflect upon nothing (as I said before) but upon
a certaine Chrystaline matter, transparent without all comparison beyond all the Diamonds of the world, reverberating in that manner backe againe with more Charity through the whole. And as the period and Crown of this admirable lustre remaines eternally the continuall presence of the Sonne of God, in whom all things are transparently beheld without obstacle, whose Majesty outshines these created and lesser lights, a million of times more then doth the great Candle of the Element darken the smallest twinkling Starre that can be perceived by any eye; whose aspect is of such an infinite brightnesse, that the blessed Spirits themselves were not able to behold his own and fathers Divinity▪ unlesse they were impowered by their goodnesse to such a perfection, which renders them not onely capable of that happinesse; but also of the under∣standing and perfect knowledge of what they are permitted to see: so that there can be no doubt at all made but that the Clarity of Heaven doth equall every way the capacity thereof; and the rather so to be believed, for that by most expressions in holy Scripture the joyes of Paradise are figured by that denomination of light and brightnesse. In the third place we may reflect upon those infinite and innu∣merable beauties that adorne this mentioned splen∣dour, the least of which is not onely capable to ra∣vish all our worldly senses, if our natures were capa∣able to entertaine such divine happinesse, but also would be able to create in the very understanding a true tast and fruition of their excellencies, which our mortall frailty now doth not suffer us to possess
in those earthly things we have though they are farre from containing the least perfection whatso∣ever. If the spacious Ovall room in Neroes Palace, wherein were placed bright looking-glasses in every Angle that represented some humane varieties of flourishing gardens, bedeckt with beautifully Flow∣ers and magnificent fountaines; at whose cleare streams many sorts of creatures seemed to take re∣freshment, could attract every spectators eye to wonder and amazement, which onely was contri∣ved by earthly art and industry: what may we con∣ceive this heavenly place to be; that had not onely a divine Majesty, but omnipotency for its founder? Besides that, it is designed for a perpetuall habitati∣on of his own glory. Certainly if Tempe in Greece afforded such plentifull matter for poeticall ficti∣ons, which was onely a small valley of naturall de∣lights, in so much as it almost gave opinion to the rude multitude, of the station of blessed and happy soules after this life, why should not the least con∣sideration of these eternall beauties transport our thoughts and desires beyond all rest and quiet, un∣till we had purchased the possession to our selves, though bought at never so deare a rate by the cru∣cifying of all inordinate passions and affections. I must confesse it is more then difficulty to represent however but to the imagination onely beauties, when neither the matter hath been seen, or the form is to be comprehended; neverthelesse we are to conceive by faith, that Heaven being God Almigh∣ties perfectest building, is in all parts furnished with infinities of pleasant and delightfull objects to the
view; especially if we consider that an Angell is more glorious in his own proper nature, then all the beauties of the world put together; and those be∣ing in a manner innumerable, and distinct in forme and excellencies, (though all to be beheld at one in∣stant) what a representation must that be to a capa∣city, that is not onely divinely enabled to distin∣guish of varieties, but to judge of perfection; which properties certainly we shall fully enjoy, being there happily placed; but above all, if we enter into the consideration of God himselfe, who is the great maker of every beauty sitting in his Throne of honour, with all his glorious Courtiers about him, cloathed with a ravishing splendour. O what a sight of satisfaction will that be, to the cleare faculty of our soules, neither dull'd by obstructions, nor hindered by interpositions; and more infinitely taking shall it be, for that, as through a transparent and admirable glasse, in him we shall evidently see not onely our own happinesse to the best advan∣tage, but all other beauties that are made by him∣selfe, both with a perfect science and absolute fruition. Again, if we conceive varieties to be another per∣fection, we may consider what a multitude of seve∣rall degrees of glories there are in that bright and blessed Palace, when every order of Angels, and each Angell in his own particular seat and place, is distinguished both in office and lustre, though all united in their wils and obedience, that makes the greater harmony; which number, for ought I know may be above a million of millions; whom, as I say
we shall all know and see without corruption or impediment, not as we doe now people of this world subject to inconstancy and imperfections, but alwaies united with sweet countenances and plea∣sind dispositions, producing variety of new delights to our imaginations, that cannot be deceived with any false objects. Besides, we shall behold all the Pa∣triarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs that ever have been in the world, bearing about with them the honourable Ensignes of their sufferings and ver∣tues, to our most unspeakable delight in every particular; but above all, we shall be more then transported with a heavenly satisfaction to con∣template the diversity of favours bestowed upon the blessed and incomparable Virgin, by the love and power of the holy Trinity, who is placed as we may suppose upon a Throne of one intire Car∣buncle, clothed in a garment wrought all over with such heavenly varieties, that nature never knew, or Angels can imitate, bearing also upon her head a Crown of stars, enterwoven with rich stones of all colours and beauties, in comparison of which, Dia∣monds and Rubies are more base then the roughest pibles are, to the most rarest Jewels that were ever yet worn by Princes upon earth, with a thousand other excellencies, no more to be numbred then to be described. Truly, if the severall and variable fancies of this world have so much power to intoxi∣cate our brains, towards a perpetuall confusion and eternall damnation; I see no reason why these ex∣cessive and satisfactory varieties of Heaven well considered should not oftentimes, if not continually
settle our judgements to more profitable and more necessary considerations; for certainly it is no other thing then diversity of earthly Chymeras that cou∣zen our appetites to so disorderly and extreame prejudice, & suggests to our imagination strange and impossible frutions, both against reason, and con∣trary to faith. But as certainly these varieties of Paradise are more then numerous; so may we con∣ceive the society to be answerably excellent there∣unto in every respect: in regard there is none can be thither admitted, but those who have been ex∣traordinary, and I may say in some sort admirable for their vertues and goodnesse in this world; and being there glorified and refined, their excellencies of nature and dispositions appeare as through a transparent glasse, not onely to themselves but to each one of the blessed in particular, to an infinity of satisfaction in society and conversation; though it be not exercised by the tongue or senses accor∣ding to humane practises, but rather in a concor∣dancy of wils and affections, wherein charity and love principally predominates; by which means every soule is induced to desire and covet the good & prosperity of each other equall with his own; so that not onely every appetite of envy is absolutely banished from that glorious and heavenly society, but the least repining is taken away at any others preferment and advancement; however it is not to be doubted, but that there are severall degrees of happinesse in that blessed mansion; which must needs render the conversation admirably sweet and delightfull, by reason of so absolute an unity in
affections. For as none shall be lead away with any manner of passion of self-love, and as little will he conceive that he wanteth an absolute perfection in his own state and condition; so the chiefe felicity any soule shall possesse in that heavenly habitation, is to see God, and by that consequence must ac∣company her fellows in the honour and worship which is not onely due to his divinity, but shall be thought the greatest increase of her own glory can possibly be enjoyed, since from that infinite Ma∣jesty each blessed Spirit doth extract all pleasure, content, and satisfaction, as from a vast Ocean of blessednesse, resembling our naturall Sea here upon earth, that bestows benefits and vertues upon every great River and little Brook, according to its pro∣perty and capacity: whilst in the interim our bles∣sed and all powerfull Saviour, resembling also in some sort the resplendent Sunne, that hath the do∣mination of every earthly thing, by his influence exhales from his fathers goodnesse and lustre a con∣venient proportion of all heavenly graces, to be∣stow what quantity he pleaseth of consolations in every respect, upon those of his perpetuall King∣dome, united as I may say in so harmonious a so∣ciety, as can never be severed in the least kinde, ei∣ther by distance or disaffection. Last of all, we may reflect upon the absolute secu∣rity of this happy Assembly; not onely so in effect, but also assured in their owne knowledges, which renders any condition satisfied beyond measure; for it seems to be a triumphant Crown, that makes all endeavours majesticall by reason of the confi∣dence
in the conclusion, since without such an opinion new perturbations will continually arise, to disquiet the possession of any felicity and delight enjoyed; which, as I say, is so absolutely purchased in this celestiall Paradise, that God Almighty nei∣ther will nor can loose his subjects and friends. And as little is it possible he should be deficient in his own mercies and goodnesse; so that being once placed in his sight, we shall not need to feare either circumvention or inconstancy; for all actions will be the same, and every thought free from variation. In like manner as our State will be intirely perfect, so cannot our wils be any way perverted, since those sensuall imperfections of surfeit and desire, must be all taken from our natures, as dependant only upon earthly & transitory possessions; for that however there will appeare in that glorious station severall degrees of beatitudes, all disposed to no∣thing but to God Almighties will and pleasure, though with a reference to each particular desert; yet none of any degree but will be fully conten∣ted with his own proportion abundantly, without coveting more, or doubting what he hath, since in beholding God, he enjoyes what he can wish, in whom is contained all knowledge, happinesse, and security. Now if all these particulars be well considered with competent understanding, not onely concer∣ning this celestiall being of the blessed, but of the miserable condition of the damned, sice the prin∣ciples cannot be denied by any Christian faith, cer∣tainly the thoughts thereof cannot chuse but stirre
up in people either some sparkles of devotion, or at leastwise procure much abatement of vice; espe∣cially if it be also remembred with any manner of contemplation, that perpetuity infallibly appertains to both these places. Certain consideration of Eternity. A Vast Sea of amazement may eternity be estee∣med, that neither can be bounded for its ex∣tent, or fathomed in its depth. For if a man were enjoyned but to drive a Snaile to the furthest part of the Indies, over a thousand interposing Rocks and Mountaines; or should be obliged to drie all the waters upon earth onely by one drop after ano∣ther, giving to each a yeeres space; yet might there be some hope in time to accomplish those stupendi∣ous labours. But this never to be ended season car∣ries with it such an incomprehensible extent, that all the art and knowledge of the world can procure no other definition thereof, but onely to give it a name, whilst the consideration may be said to stupi∣fie all memories and capacities. So that, I say, mi∣serable man may be the subject of all compassion, and the very object of every wonder, that to pur∣chase the possession of some few trifles here upon earth, which in truth are rather nothing at all, onely for one minuts space, or breath of time in conside∣ration
of Eternity, doth not onely lose the fruition of these excellent and everlasting benefits so largely mentioned, but also most inconsiderately and des∣perately doth cast himselfe headlong into a darke and deepe Dungeon, where there is nothing to be expected but everlasting sorrow, and not any thing to be felt and endured but infinite torments; and that not for a yeere or an age, but for ever and ever, without end. Since the walke of eternity may be said to resemble a person going round about con∣tinually in a circle, wherein is to be found no ter∣mination or hope at any time to finish the journey; for if we could number every sand of the Sea, and reduce them distinctly by way of Arithmetick se∣verally into so many ages, yet altogether being com∣puted with Eternity, they will not admit of so neere a comparison as the least graine of mustard-seed in magnitude with the huge circumference of the whole world: Much lesse are twenty or forty yeare of mans life to be valued in consideration of that infinity of time, or rather that time that is not at all finite, either in effect or apprehension. Be∣sides, if we had our own wishes, to sit alwaies proud∣ly upon a commanding Throne, beyond either the reach of envy, or the hazard of accidents in the in∣terim, pulling down this man, and exalting whom we please, with each single word; as also accompa∣nied entirely with all other worldly felicities could be devised: yet a little sleepe when it were neces∣sary, (which is no other then a figure of death) must again retire us into our solitary chamber, there to converse with privacy; which certainly in that
necessity would give us more content and satisfa∣ction, then the apprehension of our excessive great∣nesse and power. Wherefore, I say, if all that we can desire will not prove constantly pleasing upon earth, what may we think of the small time we have to enjoy any thing here; our lives being but as a flash of Lightning, that appeares for a moment, and afterwards goes out for ever. Certainly if that great Egyptian Monarch were mortified in his thoughts, by the turning only of his Chariot wheele, reflecting by that motion upon the inconstancy of fortune; there is no doubt but much more he did consider the shortnesse of the space, any thing could be enjoyed in this world. Tis true however time shall never be finished, yet our selves must be quickly at an end, our lives continually wasting like a Candle, though with a seeming kinde of secu∣rity we take our rest and never thinke upon it; for every day, if we would but seriously consult our looking-glasse to that purpose, we should to our griefe no doubt perceive new gray haires and wrin∣kles to encrease, both without our privity, and a∣gainst our wils. When we look back to our yeares past, we think them nothing, yet are we so foolishly transported with the vanity of present possessions, that although we have not neere so many behinde to come, yet for that short time onely to enjoy a few painted pleasures, though in our decrepit age, we are perswaded to hazard, or rather to leave in desperation our eternall condition hereafter. Nay put case it might be something doubtfull, whether there be any Hell or Heaven, or no: yet certainly
it cannot be but an extraordinary madnesse, to ven∣ture upon such an experience in the future; especi∣ally when in the present we gaine so small a benefit to our selves, as are the possessions of all these world∣ly vanities we ayme at, that have in them neither reality nor continuance; neither doe they so much as assure us here, what part of them we shall be able quietly to enjoy; for oftentimes we finde our state so miserable by reason of some accidents or other, that not seldome we are provoked to wish our selves dead as being weary of life; and yet all this while we have not so much wise foresight as to consider, that probably we are in danger, to enter into such a condition presently after the breath is out of our body, that is intolerable to be indured, being alike lasting as violent. Another kind of preposterous and deplorable vanity I must speake of, which is to see, how many people will venture through raging flames, with almost no possibility of escaping death, onely to gaine a little idle fame in the future, or some small breath of praise in the present; and yet when they should offer themselves to any manner of au∣sterity or hardnesse, for the gaining of eternity, they seeme to be either without courage or motion. O insensible stupidity and weake faith, wholly directed by sensuality and ignorance, to the greatest confusi∣on and folly can be imagined; when as after one mi∣nute, that the last gaspe is past, we shall be no more mindefull of what fame we purchased in this world, then if we had never been born at all, unlesse it be to our further punishment; for that in our life-time we did not rightly make use of those naturall faculties,
that God Almighty had bestowed upon us for our own good and his service, which being discreetly employed might have been beneficiall both to our selves and posterity: what shall we thinke also of some men reputed Philosophers, that have preten∣ded to a certaine kinde of eternity in shew, however they thought of nothing lesse in effect: which appe∣tite appeared apparently in the disposition of Mur∣cus Aurelius, that great and esteemed wise Emperour, who in his life time and prosperity, seemed to con∣temne all earthly concernments, as most vaine and idle considerations, and to that purpose often wish∣ed for death, as he said to free him from the acciden∣tall miseries of this world, though when he was really arrested by that unwelcome messenger, his faithfull & trusty secretary, had much labour to per∣swade him to any convenient fortitude at all: which plainely shewes, he was more vain-gloriously taken with his professed opinion before men, conceiving it belike for his greater honour to seeme to con∣temne death, then that either his heart was free from naturall affections of living longer here, or that his thoughts were any way transported with a desire of any other being at all, as either perhaps not belie∣ving any such thing, or else was most desperately loth to foregoe the possession of what he enjoyed al∣ready: In like manner, there was another Philoso∣pher, who being in a ship ready to be cast away by a sudden storme, notwithstanding he had preached most violently to the Marriners, not onely of the contempt of death, but of the vanity of life; did ne∣verthelesse expresse by his countenance an ex∣treame
feare and terrour: whereupon after the tem∣pest was past he was reproved with scorne by some for his hypocrisie and cowardlinesse, in pretending to despise that, which as it should seeme he most de∣sired: to which he quickly made this reply, as having no other way in part to save his reputation; that however he seemed something troubled, at the ap∣prehension of his own losse for the present, yet it was not because he did not in his thoughts really contemne death according to his profession, but that he considered how much the world should be damnified by his destruction; when as if a thousand such as themselves had perished, the matter had not been of any moment at all, in regard of the little commodity was to be made of their preservation. But however this jest served in some sort to save his reputation for the present, yet it was plaine his professions were contrary to his thoughts: for that people being out of the right way of desiring eter∣nity, they cannot possibly reflect upon the conse∣quence of such a happinesse whereby to esteeme of life and death indifferently enough; since their chiefe end, let them say what they will, is but to purchase some worldly consideration, notwithstan∣ding all their hypocriticall pretensions. Tis true many great Philosophers in former times appeared to adore no other God but future and eternall fame; yet give me leave to say, that although they might have those appetites living and being in pro∣sperity, yet it was chiefly, if not wholly upon the matter, to reap the benefit of such an opinion here during their naturall lives. As for example, we see
many raise stately mountaines, endeavouring there∣by to continue and eternize their memories upon earth; yet the neerer they draw to their deaths, those ambitions become cooler, untill at last per∣haps in the perclose, they absolutely quit and for∣goe all those vaine cogitations, and betake them∣selves onely (if they be not religious) to things be∣longing to flesh and blood, which is ease, rest, sleep, and the like, leaving apparently those hot vani∣ties of fame and ambition to younger people, that have ability of body to make use of such men∣tall delights, as having longer time to enjoy them. Which shews evidently, it is not alone eternity they seek, either in fame, remembrance, or what you will else to that purpose, but rather present and hu∣mane content inwardly, as long as they live in this world, imagining they shall be thought brave per∣sons hereafter. Which, however it seems to have reference to the future, yet well considered, it is no∣thing but a naturall satisfaction, they propose to their own apprehension, how much they shall be ho∣nored after their deaths, supposing also those that converse with them doe believe absolutly the same; which opinion, as I say, they violently desire to en∣joy, as long as they live here. For we finde by expe∣rience, that such people as make their last wils and testaments, being in perfect health and strength of body, designe huge matters for their funerals; but those that dispose of their affaires, being ready to yield up the Ghost, onely take care for a convenient place without much pompe, where they may be buried. All which are but further testimonies of
demonstration, that onely the sensualities of this world, whether they be in meere opinion, or belong to other naturall appetites, take mens desires more then any manner of eternity whatsoever. In so much as all may be reduced onely to the violent coveting of possession, however it be of never so smal a continuance, beyond all future considerations whatsoever. Which appeared plainly in the actions of Alexander the great, who seemed most ambitious∣ly to court fame and opinion, with an extraordinary aime to settle his conquered Empire to perpetuity in all magnificency, whilst he was living in prospe∣rity; but being upon his death-bed, and askt who should be King after him, he was so farre from any thoughts of future establishment, that as he de∣signed no Governour at all over his vast Dominions, so did he leave every thing in a most miserable con∣fusion, notwithstanding he had both probability of issue and his own kindred to have nominated: inso∣much as all his eminent Captains and Commanders went presently together by the eares amongst them∣selves; so that within a very few yeeres there was not one of them remained alive, or scarce any part of this conquest continued entire: Which hu∣mour had been well represented to this young Prin∣ces ambition by the rude Scythians, when their Embassadours told him, that however he seemed so violently transported with victorios land successe, yet at last he must be contented with onely ten foot of ground to containe his person, and circumscribe his glory. As much to say, when his life should be ended, he would be little the better for his prospe∣rity.
And truly, if the carcass of any Prince should be asked, what felicity it now enjoyes in regard of those past honours; if it could speak, without doubt it would make answer, none at all. For certainly, men lying upon their death-beds, are either not capable of any thoughts whatsoever, or are busied with more serious considerations, then to trouble themselves to think or desire what may be the opi∣nion of them and their actions amongst people after they are gone. However I doe not maintaine the contrary, but that it is most necessary, or at leastwise convenient in our humane condition, to endeavour a lawfull reputation, as also a fitting memory to be continued concerning our comportments in this life, provided a right end thereof be annexed there∣unto. And chiefly for these three respects: In the first place it may be supposed, that by our noble actions and endeavours we bequeath a lasting legacy of honour and reputation to our surviving friends and posterity, whereby they may be benefited in the world after us by the deserved fame of our at∣chievements. Secondly, by the demonstration of such vertues and perfections, we leave patterns and examples to all in generall, who may the sooner be enduced thereby to imitate our actions, represented to them as a most worthy object. And lastly our deservings by that means comming to be known to others, and rewarded with praise and commenda∣tion, they cannot but give encouragement to wor∣thy persons, to continue in their own designes to that purpose, since themselves may expect the like benefits, which probably will prove a means to root
out wickednesse and basenesse out of the world by reason of contrary effects: for without such prin∣ciples it is unpossible that any Commonwealth can long remaine prosperous. So that in a word, to sum up all this whole discourse; whosoever seeks any thing but Heaven for his utmost and eternall pe∣riod, is either a foole or a mad man, since as I said before, not onely all other things are defective, but the very time it selfe when they can be enjoyed in regard of eternity, is not so much as the least mo∣ment compared with a million of ages. Besides I may affirm, that all worldly actions at the best must be buried in obscurity, and at the worst they end in misery and confusion: for though honour, fame, riches, and the like, are convenient benefits to be sought by noble dispositions, as well for examples to encourage vertue and goodnesse, as to avoid sloth and idlenesse; yet must they notwithstanding be joyned with absolute intentions, to procure something more then either earthly satisfaction du∣ring this life, or a bare hope of a fantasticall opinion afterwards; since eternity will reach beyond the worlds dissolution, when all things of flesh and blood must end, being so ordained by an omnipo∣tend decree, before either nature or time was crea∣ted. But now that we haue, as I suppose, spoke suf∣ficiently of Hell, Heaven, and Eternity; Let us a little take a view of this earthly life of ours, that we seem so exceedingly much to value and esteem in this world, since for it we hazzard all these before-men∣tioned good and evils.
Considerations upon the shortnesse of mans life upon earth, with many other inconveniencies there∣unto belonging. IN the first place we may consider the shortnesse of our time here upon earth, according to the computation of the best knowing judgements; since by way of purchase in any estate, there is no Lawyer that reckons another persons life at above ten yeeres, let his complexion and constitution be never so strong and healthfull, considering the di∣versity of accidents, that belong to our humane condition so; that dividing this ten yeares space into three parts, we must confesse one of them is wholly taken up in sleepe, wherein we possesse no pleasure at all; however some necessary satisfaction may be reaped thereby to our tyred and wearied nature; for we remaine as I may say all that while both uselesse to our selves and to others. Another third part of this time we may give to the crostes and vexations of the world, with other imploy∣ments that must be personned, though perhaps we receive neither delight or content by actions of that nature. All which being indifferently calculated, there will remaine to our own proper share and commodity entirely, but a very few yeares, wherein can be fully and totally enjoyed these violent desi∣red
felicities of the earth, that so much contrary to all reason bewitch our soules and senses; as onely for the fruition and possession of them, we in a manner cast away the very thought of this great and infinite eternity, already so largly described, accompanied by all those incomprehensible plea∣sures of heaven; and runne desperatly into the dan∣ger of enduring such horrid torments, as no Pen can write or tongue can utter. But put case notwith∣standing we have allotted but ten yeares to mans life, considering all casualties as I said before of this world, either by plague, famine, warre, feavours, sicknesse, or the like, we could enjoy a hundred yeares of durance, which I will be bold to say, not one man in an hundred thousand, doth arrive unto, by any Physicke and temperance can be practised; yet dividing this terme also into three parts, as we have done the former, we shall finde that very little of it will bring us that satisfaction we may suppose. As for example, the first season of our infancy, is wholly spent in ignorance and instruction, wherein for the most part we live (according to our appre∣hension) under such subjections, that we receive no contented satisfaction in our present condition; however I may affirme it to be the best time of our delight. If we consider the middle of our age, we shall finde it perpetually accompanied with such care, vexations, and troubles, that they prove con∣tinually interruptions and impediments to any con∣tent or satisfaction our soules can entertaine; since at the best we are alwayes in feare to be deprived of what we have, or too much solicitous to gaine what
we have not. And for the latter part of our time, we have enough to doe instead of expecting de∣lights, to thinke of curing our infirmities, and pat∣ching up the breaches and decayes of nature, that are daily made in our bodies by age; like old lea∣king vessels, who however they may for sometime be preserved with much care and paynes, yet can never be made for any use of long continuance. Truly, if we well observe our concernments after fifty (which is the age allotted by that wise Philo∣sopher, Marcus Aurelius the Emperour, for man chief∣ly to begin his misery) we shall finde it wholly de∣barred from any manner of constant felicity; as for example, if we have no children to succeed us in those worldly fortunes and honour, which we so much labour for in this humane life, certainly it cannot but be esteemed no small defect to our con∣dition; neither are those apprehensions to be blamed in us, when as we have for a patterne the example of that holy man Abraham, who complained, being ex∣treamly sensible of such a crosse, that the steward of his house was to be his heire, for want of naturall posterity I; for if this good person apprehended it as a cause of affliction to his thoughts, much more must our exceeding weake frailty be moved with the con∣sideration: of the other side, if we have children gi∣ven us by God Almighty, according to our wishes, yet want we not daily perturbations in our minds, left they might miscarry at one time or other by reason of worldly accidents; considering the many chances that hourely happen to all manner of con∣ditions; and of the contrary, if they prove untoward
and disobedient, answerable to the customes of the age; what greater crosse can possibly afflict our thoughts or torment our rest; which perpetuall vex∣ation at last, may constraine us perhaps a thousand times to wish they had never beene borne to their own destruction and our griefe. Of the other side, if our delights be chiefly in friendship and conver∣sation, how soone may that esteemed felicity be ta∣ken from our possession, either by suddain jealousies or froward accidents, when we least expect the un∣happinesse; if the gaining of riches best please our appetites, though we have imployed many yeares in the acquisition of golden mountaines, either warre, oppression, or some law-suite or other may soone deprive us of all we have, and cast us into an unre∣coverable and desperate poverty, since our affaires depend upon the will and intentions of men, wick∣ed and uncertaine. For truly either our owne ser∣vants may betray us corrupt judges undoe us, or our debtors prove banckrupt, all which often hap∣pen, and then quickly vanisheth away all our e∣steem. Besides a hundred other casualties that can∣not be mentioned at present, because not thought upon. Now, I say, if these perturbations and casu∣alties be incident to the best and most solid time of our humane condition, when as our bodies and un∣derstandings are most in vigour, to enjoy earthly fe∣licities and content, what may we thinke of our de∣caying and criped age: when as we shall see our teeth dayly, to drop one by one from our hollow jawes and dryed gums, untill at last we have none at all left, for our necessary use and commodity. Our
eyes in like manner by degrees to grow dim, having onely their faculties preserved a while by spectacles and other meanes, untill at the length we become starke blind, leaving us in a posture uncomfortable, since we are sure never more to behold the glorious Sunne or the cheerfull dayes light; and for our legs they will appeare rather like small stalkes of withe∣red plants, then convenient or substantiall suppor∣ters of our weake bodies, which must necessarily be assisted by crutches or some other artifice, to helpe us in our motion from place to place, whereby the best to give us a little ease and recreation, whilst we are able in any sort to crawle upon the face of the earth; and however this helpe may serve for a while to supply the defects of decaying nature, yet in the end our beds or some solitary couch being overbur∣thened with Catars and Rhumes must be the onely receptacle of our age and infirmity, where perhaps we shall converse with nothing but excessive pain and melancholy thoughts, as a neere preparation for our graves, to which station it may be doubted scarce a tear shal accompany us from the eyes of any of our friends, imagining we have had a sufficient time, of being in the world, whereupon I must here remember the custome of the Indians, who used to put to death such people amongst them, that by rea∣son of their extraordinary age, were thought past action and imployment, which testifies that even Barbarians themselves, apprehend nothing but un∣happinesses in our last continuance. Now I say if this condition appertaine, to those that have been the greatest darling of fortune, and prosperity in
this world; what may we judge of such, that during their lives have had nothing but troublesome pas∣sage, concerning their affaires in the whole course of their time, as it were still conversing either with want, imprisonment, diseases, or some other appa∣rent afflictions of this life. Alas if we consider but the poore husbandman, that doth not onely conti∣nually toyle, for a contemptible subsistence, in heat and cold, in wet and dry, but is oftentimes in dan∣ger to be plundered of all he hath, and not seldom loseth his own life in defence of his small family, by the violent oppressions of mercilesse souldiers; we may imagine his trouble and vexations give him no great cause of felicity. In what a miserable and horrid condition is a Galleyslave, however he be endued with the same nobility of soule, as the greatest and mightiest Prince upon earth. Certainly the beggers that goe from doore to doore spin out a life in outward appearance of sufficient misery and vexation, notwithstanding they neither hope nor expect any other. And truly, however some few persons may seem to be in a more prosperous condition, yet considering the uncertainty of what they possesse, and the impossibility of coutinuance without change and alteration, they are not to be esteemed very far from them in unhappinesse. For although perchance we may look with eyes of envy upon many glorious Potentates in the world, yet if their thoughts perhaps were truly examined, we shall finde multitudes of vexations depending upon their condition, to the destroying of all certaine content: for what Prince was there ever yet, that
commanded so intirely prosperity, that hath not often been troubled with naturall infirmities, as the stone, gout, and the like; to free himselfe from which paine, perhaps he would willingly have par∣ted with much of his Dominion, if it had been pos∣sible, to have procured such a redemption at any price. How many people againe are born blinde, dumbe, and deafe, with other notorious imperfecti∣ons of nature, that render them contemptible in the world, and yet are as greedy after the appetite of living long, as those which enjoy most felicity; which shews, that it is not the reall fruition of any earthly delight, that gives us occasion to value our being here, but meerly a senselesse stupidity of flesh and blood, that makes us covet we know not what, without the soules consideration. Withall, if we but look at the chances, accidents, and misfortunes of many glorious Monarches, we shall have cause little enough to depend upon the certaine happi∣nesse of any condition whatsoever. As for example, the Emperour Morisius, being in possession of as much prosperity as could be devised, of a sudden in his greatest Majesty was surprized, by the con∣spiracy of a base and barbarous fellow of his Army, and presently brought bound before his insulting prefence, where on his knees he was constrained to behold the cruell slaughter of his deare wife and all his young children one after another, untill at last himself made up the doleful Catastrophy, as a period to his affliction and misery, whilst his worst enemy in the interim was proclamed before his eyes. A∣gain Bagazat King of the Turkes that brought three
hundred thousand souldiers into the field against Tamberlin, was that very day taken prisoner with all his glory, and presently shut up in an Iron-cage, to be made a spectacle of wonder and contempt to all the world, where not long after he ended his dayes violently by his own hands. We may also in this place remember, the sudden misfortunes of the late Queene of Scots, that was a young brave and beau∣tifull Princesse married to the King of France, yet notwithstanding, within a few yeares returning into Scotland, to take possession of her native Kingdome, she was brought to such confusion, by the treason of her owne naturall subjects, that Flying into Eng∣land for assistance against their rebellions, she was betrayed and cast into prison, where she remained untill she lost her head upon a Scaffold, in the view of all the people, without having so much as one sword drawne in her revenge, though she was ally∣ed to most of all the powerfull Princes of Christen∣dome. If we looke also at the glories of Herod the great, who seemed fortunate and prosperous beyond mea∣sure in this world, yet we finde his life so mixt with such intolerable crosses and vexations, that he was not onely induced to the slaugher of his most belo∣ved wife and naturall children, to maintaine his Crown in safety against his suspicions, but towards his last end was in that fearfull manner tormented with paine and griefe, that one time in a certaine desperate humour calling for a knife to paire an ap∣ple, he would have killed himselfe, if he had not beene suddenly prevented, by some of his friends
and servants. We read also of a Duke of Vrben, who was esteemed by all that knew him a Paragon of nature, for his excellent abilities of minde, and composure of body, and run on a long space with a most fortunate successe in all his actions, both in war and peace; yet almost in an instant no man knew how, he was so exceedingly cast down with diseases and infirmities, that he became a subject of pitty and compassion, not being able to stir one foot, but as he was carryed from place to place in a Chair, but for a more ancient and authentical testimony of the uncertainty of worldly honours and happinesse, we may cast our eyes upon the fate of wicked Ha∣man in the holy Scripture, who notwithstanding he had the absolute command of a hundred and twen∣ty Provinces, was so tormented in his thoughts, because a poor Jew would not adore him, that he not onely procured thereby his own shameful death upon a pair of Gallowes, but also was an eye or an ear witness of his childrens slaughter, though him∣self was forced to worship in person, that very man whom he most hated and despised. Last of all, I will mention Charles our late King, who for some yeers appeared to be the envy of Eu∣rope, not onely for his prosperous glory, and happi∣nesse, but in regard also of the numerousnesse of his private family, yet the wheel of fortune suddainly turning upon him, he was, as I may say, in an instant thrown from his Throne, separated from his wife, deprived of his children (being the chief com∣forts of humanity) and forced to undergo a long, tedious, and harsh imprisonment, until in the end he
lost his life like his Grand-Mother, before his own Palace gate, as a greater testimony of the ignominy that was intended his person and dignity. Which in my opinion, are testimonies with many others, sufficient to shew the little certainty of all tempo∣rary felicities; however, for the most part we are preposterously carryed away beyond wisdom, and with too violent passion, to sacrifice for this brittle possession, not onely all our hopes of eternal happi∣nesse, but even as it were desperately, as I said be∣fore, induced to run into those black and terrible flames of fire, that can never be quenched. Which truly is a stupidity (if rightly considered) of so transcendent a nature, that nothing but the infinite malice and subtility of the devil is able to create in peoples desires and understandings. But however these considerations might perswade man, to some kinde of diligent care of vertue, for his benefit and preservation, yet I finde a certain insensibility in∣graffed by these times in many persons imaginations, though in outward moral conversation, they seem to be competently honest, that they have so laid a∣sleep their Faith and confidence concerning God Almighty, that they cannot be confirmed in his goodnesse, mercy, and justice, so far as to expect with any manner of patience the end and successe of things, for no other reason then because they see oftentimes many Athiestical people, to prosper a long season in all worldly honours and glory; whilst of the contrary, those that are religious and good, undergo nothing but afflictions and miseries, apprehending as if Gods indignation were against
his professed servants in all the course of their lives: but though to this Argument, I might make a con∣vincing Reply both from Scripture and other unan∣swerable reasons grounded upon true piety, by which principles, all our actions and thoughts should be governed, yet for that I intend a greater brevity to rectifie in some sort such persons beliefs and settle their judgements; I shall onely relate a short story (as I conceive) something to the pur∣pose, but whether true or figurative makes no matter, since the application is very proper to shew, that Almightie Gods wayes and determi∣nations are not to be understood by us upon all occasions; onely I must aver by this example, it is our duties to observe his Injunctions, notwith∣standing all humane obstacles; in every thing lea∣ving the issue to his inscrutable decrees, which for the most part, however will be accompanyed with his mercies, if we have humility and patience e∣nough to attend upon his pleasure that must be performed do what we can.
A most full, though figurative story to shew that God Almighties wayes and inscrutable decrees are not to be comprehended by humane fancies. IT was as we may probably imagine, in the primi∣tive times, that a religious person living in the Desert, being something unsatisfied concerning the wayes and the judgements of Almighty God, as I said before, in this world, seeing many wicked men prosper in their affairs, with a certain kinde of smi∣ling felicity, whilst other people of a vertuous life and conformity in their manners, underwent no∣thing but crosses (for the most part) in all their actions and designes, desired in his prayers by reason of these considerations to be made more particular∣ly acquainted with the mysteries of Heaven con∣cerning these things that trouble his thoughts. Wherefore, upon a day being at his devotions, it was revealed unto him, that however he seemed too presumptuous in thus tempting God, and not rest∣ing satisfied with prosecuting the duty of his own condition, with lesse curiosity, yet his request not∣withstanding was heard and he should be shortly fully cleered in his doubt, commanding him in the interim to be patient in his expectation, resting as I may say, in some sort satisfied with this Revelation
and injunction. After some few weeks he became sa∣luted of a suddain by a beautiful yong man, to his no small amazement, who told him he was come as a di∣vine Messenger to inform his knowledge, and instruct his belief, wherefore bid him without delay to pre∣pare himself for a journey, that he was to make in his company and under his conduct; the sequel of which as he said would fully content his expectation. The aged Father without either any manner of re∣sistance or much more circumstance, then onely ta∣king a staffe in his hand the better to support his weak steps, followed him out of his Cell; and in this posture they prosecuted a journey, that conti∣nued them travelling the whole day, till at last the shutting in of the evening bringing them into a small Village, they were entertained in a house for their nights repose, where they found both kinde and competent entertainment, which conveniency gave them satisfaction, until the early Sun the next morning warned them to provide for a new voyage; so taking leave of the Master of this habitation, they went out of doores; However, in the interim the young man took up a silver Goblet and put it up in his Satchel, to the wonder of the old Hermit, since it appeared to him to be a strange example of justice and gratitude. But neverthelesse, for that he had resigned his will to his conductors discretion, he took no notice outwardly of the seeming theft. And in this manner again prosecuted their course for the length of another Summers day. But the night at last as the former approaching, and they seeming both weary of their tedious march, they
entered into another lodging, wherein their treat∣ment appeared far different in every respect from their past entertainment, not onely in that they wanted the like accommodation, but were also re∣viled with harsh and barbarous language, to their no small vexation and discontent; and yet the young man at his departure with many kinde words be∣stowed upon the owner of the house the silver Gob∣let, that before he had taken from the other party; which probably did not a little increase the admira∣tion of his aged companion, though he was resol∣ved not to question any of his proceedings, until a further issue might be had of the businesse. And so proceeded on both to a new journey and more ex∣periments, however these deportments, as I said be∣fore, seemed strange examples of justice and good∣nesse for edification. Which contemplations gave entertainment and employment to the old mans thoughts, until they found that another retirement was necessary both for their bodies and mindes; and to this purpose entring into a fair Town, they were soon met by a most courteous Gentleman in the streets, who perceiving them to be religious persons told them, no place but his own house should give them reception and welcom, and to this purpose, ac∣companied by many of his servants (for he was a person of great quality) he conducted them to his Palace, where they found such welcom and recepti∣on, as might have befitted Princes of extraordinary dignity and extraction, which continued them with wonderfull satisfaction till the next morning, that their occasions called them again, to the perfecting
of other adventures; wherefore taking their leaves with many thanks and a great deal of humility, the Nobleman seemed to commit them to Gods prote∣ction and their own intentions, however when he was parted from them, they continuing still in the Hall, pretending some other necessary accommoda∣tion belonging to their own private affairs, the young man of a suddain perceiving a child lying in the Cradle asleep, who was the onely son and heir of that noble family, presently stept to the infant, and violently strangled him with his hands, and wink∣ing upon his fellow traveller as a testimony of desi∣red silence, he secretly stole out of the house. Which cruelty raised such stormes and feares in the old mans bosom, that he appeared half distracted with the seeming wickednesse of the fact. But though he was transported with an amazed grief, yet he fol∣lowed his bloody conductor, something doubtful of those Revelations he had received from Heaven; neverthelesse, upon better recollection, he resolved neither to question his guide nor flie from his prote∣ction, for that his faith proved stronger then his pas∣sions. Which once again put them into their usual posture of travail, until going over a narrow Bridge and meeting another passenger in the way, with a kinde of rude and harsh encounter the young man that went a little before, instead of giving the tra∣veller friendly and courteous passage, tumbled him into the water, who after some fruitlesse striving with the waves, at last in their sight yeelded up his life as a testimony of the worst oppression, whereat the young man onely laughed heartily, as if he had
beheld some object of pleasure, when as he had per∣formed an act of most barbarous cruelty, and thus carelesly went on still his journey to the almost con∣founding of the old mans thoughts, notwithstand∣ing his former resolutions. But long they had not journied in this manner, before they met another person violently prosecuting his voyage, who desi∣red them for the love of God to direct him towards the readiest and neerest way to the next Town, for that, as he said, most of all his worldly fortunes consisted in his safe and speedy arrival before night, siince the Sunne now seemed almost set; yet the young man according to the appearing effects of his wonted charity, instead of fullfilling the poor mans pittiful request, directed him a clean contrary way to that he desired, by which means he was probably endangered never to come to the place he so ear∣nestly coveted; at which ill-natured falshood the old father another time cast up his amazed eyes to Hea∣ven, though without reproof or contradiction, and followed still his leader, which ere long brought them to another Inne for their nights repose, though entring the house, they could scarse finde out any lodging at all, by reason the rooms were taken up and filled by multitudes of debauched rude and barbarous thieves, neverthelesse the young man was so far from having any more care of the aged father, rather seeming weary of his longer conversation, that he presently addressed himself unto them, and at last strook into a most intimate acquaintance with those robbers and murtherers, where he continued roaring and drinking all night without intermission
or having, as I said before, the least seeming care of his welfare and consolation, whilst he poor man was forced to continue in the Chimney-corner, onely comforted with a few Prayers of his own, which earnestly he offered unto God Almighty to appease his wrath, hearing such blasphemies uttered against his holy name. However these exercises endured untill the next daies light summoned them to a new journey; as also invited, or rather provoked the villanous thieves, each to seek out some corner or other whereby to take their necessary rest, although the night before they had all determined to quit the habitation, for feare of some sudden surprise by the Officers of the Countrey, in regard of many wicked robberies they had lately committed, with other murthers. And thus again the old man and his companion fell anew to their travels, having quitted that hellish habitation, which lasted untill they arrived at the walls of a great and mighty City; where they found, to their amazement, one Divell asleepe at the gate, which proved an object of consideration to the eyes of the old man, who rather expected a multitude, if any at all, to guard the passage and entrance of such a proud Town, that seemed to ring with nothing but noise and confusion the practices being onely intollerable lux∣ury. But passing further, leaving the Divell at his rest, with an intention to finde out some convenient lodging for their repose; at last they came to a most poore and needy Monastary, where notwithstan∣ding entring, although they could perceive no∣thing there professed, but Fasting, Prayers, Mortifi∣cations,
and the like; yet they found in every cor∣ner multitudes of divels, all extream wakefull and vigilant, insomuch as Lucifer seemed there to keepe his chiefe and royall Court, as if not to be delighted with any other habitation; which truly did again exceedingly amaze the consideration of the old Hermit beyond beliefe and imagination, by reason the sight appeared so wonderfully to outgoe his expectation. But however with these extravagant and distra∣cted thoughts, the aged father was conducted to his Cell, there to be necessarily reposed untill the next day, since his body seemed in a manner to be tyred out with his hard and tedious journey, and his mind no what lesse wearied by the strange visions he had beheld in his travaile; which may be concei∣ved, gave him not that rest that was accustomed to refresh his Spirits in the wildernesse, being free from such diversity of imaginations. However after a very little sleep, waking very early in the morning, he was suddenly saluted by the young man, that had been his companion with this unexpected language, when his thoughts were preparing for a new jour∣ney: You must know, said he, I am an Angel sent by Almighty God, not onely to shew you these my∣steries that passed in our travels, but according to your desires and supplications, to let you see more plainly his divine waies and inscrutable judge∣ments, sometimes hapning against all appearance of humane sense and reason, though alwaies tending to good and profitable purposes, if mans unhappy con∣dition could make use of the benefit; which often
times he doth not doe by reason of the corruption of his depraved nature, and the want of that com∣petent grace his diligence and religious industry should have purchased at Gods hands for his advan∣tage. To which effect therefore be advertised, that this figurative story is thus meant for your better confirmation: The first man at whose house we hapned to lodge, that gave us seeming kind enter∣tainment with all humanity (from whose possession however I took a Silver Goblet at our departure) onely signifieth men competently good in this world; upon whose condition notwithstanding God Almighty is pleased to lay earthly affliction, by may considerable losses, whereby the better to re∣taine their actions and desires in a moderate temper: And therefore not seldome bestows their goods upon people lesse deserving, which is plainly de∣monstrated by the other rough and harsh personage, unto whom I gave the Goblet, though he could no way claime any just or deserved right thereunto; it being all the benefit such shall receive either in this world or the next, by reason of the small portion of grace their covetous and ill-natured actions have purchased at Gods hands; notwithstanding they may not be esteemed the wickedst sort of men. Next concerning the Nobleman, who appeared to our ap∣prehension both rich, religious, and courteous; by him may be figured those persons, who joyn devo∣tion with the glory of this life, without any inten∣tion in their minds either to offend God, or preju∣dice their neighbours; however lest they may be too much transported by degrees, with any over∣violent
desires and objects of this world, as children, honour, or the like, God Almighty is pleased often∣times to take away the occasion, by depriving them of something they most esteem, which is sig∣nified by my private destroying the life of that good mans onely sonne and heire, in regard he see∣med to have placed too much passionate appetite in the contemplation of his earthly succession; which considerations oftentimes distracted his thoughts, from the necessary cogitatious belonging to his salvation. Again, the Traveller we met upon the narrow bridge, that I seemed so uncharitably and inhumanly to overthrow was at that time go∣ing to perform a wicked action, that would indu∣bitably have cast away his soule, unlesse it had been prevented in the interim by his sudden death: wherefore the intention being foreseen by the pro∣vidence and mercy of God, I was by his goodnesse commanded to that office and execution. And for the other party that so passionately begged our di∣rection in his journey, I was constrained to turne him out of his right way, to avoyd his falling upon many bloody thieves that would not onely have robbed him of his money, but also have taken away his life; which onely that happy diversion changed into prevention and safety. And now concerning the mystery of those blasphemous Bandits we met in our last Inne, in whose company I appeared to take so much complacency and delight, I did that onely to retaine their persons the longer in that place (who else would have quickly departed) as foresee∣ing the next morning they should be apprehended
by Officers of justice, which else they would avoyd, and so consequently followed their deserved and condigne punishment, not onely in recompence of their many hainous wickednesses, but for the more entire preservation of the honest Countrey people, that would have suffered by their escape infinite dammage, and many injuries, in regard of their violence and oppression. But now last of all, to come to the explanation of this great, riotous and vicious City, confused with noise, and replenished with extraordinary glory and splendour, at whose gate we found onely one Divell asleep, though the manners & comportment of the inhabitants seemed to be governed by the directions and instigations of millions of infernall spirits. You must know that however their multitudes of wickednesses may pretend to all Hellish conversation, yet Lucifer fin∣ding there is so little need of diligence, to corrupt their conversations, already sufficiently depraved to his purpose, being drowned also in security, im∣ployeth his chiefe care and industry for the perver∣ting of this poore Monasterie, which he very well knows is imployed night and day in nothing but Prayers, Fastings, and other extraordinary mortifi∣cations; wherefore, and by reason of which, it con∣tinually warres against the power and deceipt of his infernall Kingdom; so that necessarily it behoo∣veth him to that purpose, to imploy all the instru∣ments and subjects he can possibly to undermine the thoughts and actions of these godly and pain∣full people, being the onely cause that so many Di∣vels in every corner are to be found in this simple
habitation to your wonder and admiration. And thus according to my duty, since I am com∣manded thereunto by the will of Almighty God, have I not onely shewed you these mysteries in our journey, but thereby explained and proposed to your condition, henceforth to rest absolutely satis∣fied with the Decrees of Heaven concerning his proceedings in humane affaires, notwithstanding how contrary soever they may appeare to your ap∣petite or conception; for having sufficiently revea∣led principles of religion, whereon to ground your faith, and to direct your actions, you need no more for your salvation and morall conversation. To which purpose I must again tell you, and conclude with this saying, that as the intention of Almighty God is one thing, and the waies of man oftentimes another; so are you obliged to leave off your curio∣sities in that behalfe; and with these words pre∣sently vanished from his sight. As I suppose this relation well considered may be of sufficient force to perswade any persons reason, to the conformity with Gods will in all things, without examining the mysteries of his secret judgements; so of the other side, however some∣times they appeare strange to our apprehensions, yet is he alwaies mercifull and just in the execution of his intentions; which for the most part are very good and profitable for our condition, if we have grace and confidence enough to make use of the benefits of such determinations; since he is accustomed to turne those things that seem most against our desires and naturall ap∣petites,
into the greatest blessings that can possibly be imagined. As of the contrary, the very delights that most please our fancies in this fraile life, though they may seem lawfull of themselves if they were not prevented, not seldome become obstacles to our greatest felicity, or entertained by overmuch passion prove destructive to our humane and eter∣nall affaires. But for the better confirmation of these points of duty, and because examples are the best inducements to instruct any mans beliefe, and so by consequence to invite his actions and endea∣vours, I shall in this place make a relation of a short story, which however it it may be thought but plain and simple, yet in my opinion is extreamly convin∣cing to our purpose, which I have read to be after this manner. There was a principall and wealthy Citizen, ha∣ving but one sonne in the world,Another story much to the same purpose. had occasion to send him with his onely brother by sea, into a farre Countrey, to make good some necessary traffique. But this Gentleman in the interim apprehended, as he had good cause, the danger and hazzard of the journey, wherefore presently after his sonnes de∣parture, he went to the Bishop of the Town (being a very holy man) and earnestly desired him he would be pleased in his daily devotions to remember his friends voyage and prosperity; and to this effect, to render his wishes more pleasing to God, bestow∣ed upon the reverend father, a very vast summe of Gold, to be imployed to what uses he would thinke fit concerning charitable deeds, towards the obtai∣ning of his request. The good Bishop interpreting
his inward intentions by his outward bounty, not believing such a liberality could proceed but from a religious confidence in God Almighty, not onely promised him his best assistance, in his holy exerci∣ses, as he should have occasion continually to per∣form them, but at that very instant fell down upon his knees, and earnestly besought God to favour the Gentlemans request; after which he dismist him full of assurance and joy. However this en∣counter being past, it was not long before the pious Citizen, not onely heard newes of his sonnes death, but also of casting away of the ship, wherein was contained in a manner all his wealth and subsistence. When these unfortunate tidings came to the sor∣rowfull eares of the religious Patriarch, who had received the Gentlemans money, he knew not which way to turne himselfe both for shame and griefe: Neverthelesse putting his chiefe trust in God Almighty, after he had continued a long time at his prayers, he resolved again to visit his bene∣factor, to try what consolation it was possible for his presence and perswasions to afford him after so great a losse, which had probably brought upon his present condition a most wonderfull affliction, but notwithstanding he used what admonitions and other pious instructions were necessary for the season, yet were they all too little seemingly to ease a heart so much overwhelmed with despaire and sadnesse, insomuch as the Bishop was forced to re∣turn without that wished satisfaction he desired, being also in a manner confounded in his own thoughts, considering the unfortunate successe of
his endeavours, so little answering the others inten∣tions of piety and goodnesse. However he never left soliciting God Almighty daily, according to his custom, in his behalfe; untill it fortuned one night, after the distressed Gentleman had wrought him∣selfe into some slumber by the tossing over of many troublesome and vexatious thoughts in his unquiet bosome, he imagined to see the holy Bishop to stand before him, uttering these words in distinct tearms: Know, said he, that thy charity and afflictions have not been forgotten in the sight of God, whose pro∣perty is alwaies one way or other to look upon his servants in griefe and anguish of mind; to which purpose I am to tell thee, that although thy sonne be really dead, yet his miscarriage proved so happy to his condition, that if he had again returned safe into thy protection, he had been certainly and eter∣nally damned, whereas now he is placed in heaven amongst the blessed with all joy and security. But for thy ship, with thy brother, plentifully laden with aboundance of rich commodities, they are so farre from being cast away, that thou shalt shortly receive them into thy wished possession, without any manner of losse or detriment. Whereupon Phe∣lochristus (for so was he called) waking out of his sleepe, found himselfe not onely exceedingly com∣forted, but almost cleared of all his griefe, and with these thoughts and cogitations went instantly to the holy Patriarch, and there throwing himselfe at his feet, declared his vision in every particular; as also gave infinite thanks, that God Almighty, who (as he said) had more shewed his mercy in his cha∣stizement
and punishment by this very accident, then formerly he had done in bestowing upon him so many worldly blessings and prosperities, and from that time forward remained most contentedly satisfied. By which discourse may be gathered, not onely the determination and purposes of Almighty God, though often kept from our knowledge in a hidden and mysterious way, but sheweth in like manner to a confident soule, that it is still in his power when he pleaseth to give our hearts content after never so many desperate crosses and afflictions; for however he doth not alwaies grant our desires, since they may not be convenient oftentimes either for our present or future condition; yet most com∣monly if we have sufficient beliefe and assurance in his goodnesse, he doth use to change even the na∣ture of our appetites themselves, making that ap∣peare delightfull to our apprehensions, that before was terrible and distastfull: And so by a contrary consequence, in easing the mind he diverteth the griefe, never laying upon our fraile natures a grea∣ter burthen then we are able to beare, unlesse we destroy our own strength by over much impatiency, and respecting against his will and commande∣ments, too violently worldly things, which in truth is onely the occasion of all our misery and inward vexation: Since it is not the accidents themselves that procure the smart, but onely the want of bea∣ring them rightly, which certainly cannot be well effected but by an absolute resignation of our wils in every thing, into the hands of Almighty God, who can and will dispose of our persons and actions
to the greatest advantage for our own good, if we resolve to comply in this manner with his pleasure, as it fared with holy Tobias, after the end of all his crosses and miseries; to which purpose we shall make in this place as a most excellent pattern and example, some relation of his life, sufferings, and patience, accompanied by his extraordinary confi∣dence in Gods mercies and protection. The wonderfull confidence of old Tobias in the mercies of Almighty God. AS it is recorded in Scripture, that from his very childhood he served God with all his heart, not onely when he was in freedom and prosperity, but also when he suffered poverty and oppression, so is it in like manner mentioned, that he was so far from contaminating himselfe, when others worship∣ped Idols, that in the interim he went to Ierusalem to adore in the Temple; besides in his captivity he alwaies relieved the necessity of his brethren, and notwithstanding the fury and violence of the perse∣cution under the King of Assyria, he could not be induced by any threats, to abstaine from burying those slaughtered persons that lay dead in the streets; in so much as one day being ready to sit down at a Feast with other company, of a sudden understanding there was yet one Jew that wanted
a Sepulchre, he presently flew from his dinner with extraordinary zeale, and performed that charitable office, not onely to the wonder of all those that were with him, but even being reproved by his neerest friends, who apprehended exceedingly the danger of the action, in regard it was so strictly forbidden by the Kings speciall command. Though these testi∣monies were exemplar, yet afterward when this good man fell into his excessive poverty, then did his admirable vertue more clearly appeare; for not having wherewithall to relieve his necessity other∣wise then by the labour of his wives hands, and his own industry, becomming also by a most lamentable accident deprived of his sight. Neverthelesse one day when his wife brought him home a young Kid, which she had procured by that onely means for their provision and sustenance; he hearing it bleate, desired her that if it belonged to any other, she would again restore it, lest it might bring a curse upon their poore family, wishing and resolving ra∣ther they might put their trust in God Almighty, concerning their necessities, then any way seeke to be relieved by fraudulent and unlawfull waies. Againe, being upbrayded by his wife, and other friends, for his overmuch confidence in God, as they pretended, since his Almes and Prayers had procu∣red him no more favour, then a world of present miseries; He returned them only answer of rebuke for their impiety, in regard they had not more trust and assurance in Gods power and goodnesse, who as he said, ever would protect his servants. But now at last being come, as I may say, to the insupporta∣ble
period of his crosses and afflictions; and as it were tyred by the upbraidings of his own friends, he made his humble supplications to heaven to be ta∣ken out of this life; whereupon after he had ended his prayers, imagining his suit was granted, he called unto him his young sonne, unto whom he had not onely given most pious instructions, wherein he wished him above all things, and in every difficulty to serve God with his whole heart, putting his onely confidence in his divine mercies, but sent him into a far Countrey to seeke his fortune, delivering him at the same time a bill in writing, whereby to re∣quire a certaine summe of money that had been a long time owing him by a friend for his better sup∣port and subsistence, not being wel able to maintain him at home. And notwithstanding his wife seemed desperately afflicted at this unexpected resolution and sudden departure of their only child, he still wished her to put her confidence in heaven, not onely for the assurance of his journey and returne, but also for his future prosperity; wherein may be noted, his faith and suppression of his own passions: for as indubitably he more trusted in Gods assi∣stance, then in any other probability whatsoever, so was he willing of the other side, to lay aside his pre∣sent comforts for the succeeding good of his child, which was not as he thought to be obtained, if he had kept him at home, wherein he should have more pleased his own humane nature, then any way have provided for his sonnes welfare. Having de∣clared thus much concerning this holy man, it is now full time to come to his reward according to
his merit, which no doubt was resolved on by a hidden and an inserutable decree. For God Almigh∣ty was so well satisfied with this good persons acti∣ons and intentions, that instantly he designed an Angell to accompany his sonne, who not onely conducted him safely in his journey, but at last brought him where was concluded a most happy marriage between him and his own kinswoman af∣ter they had both conquered the divell by their prayers and other vertues: which being finished, they repaired with much joy and gladnesse to the house of old Tobias, where they were received with such expressions of gladnesse, as became the nature of so great a happinesse. Neither was this all their felicity, for presently the father by miracle obtai∣ned his long lost sight, in the presence of his family and friends; and after the end of forty yeeres con∣tinued prosperity, the old father having seen a nu∣merous posterity, between his sonne and daughter in law, he finished his happy daies in the spirit of Prophesie and vertue, leaving behind him young Tobias to performe his funerall. These relations certainly, may give a taste to e∣very good Christian, of God Almighties mercies in∣tended in one manner or other to those that have a sufficient trust in his goodnesse and power. But however, as I say, all our happinesse consists in this absolute resignation of our will, in regard it doth not onely assure us of a future benefit, but promiseth a present content by quieting our thoughts and passi∣ons; though it is unpossible to procure this necessary confidence, without a lively and intire faith, which
is a kind of an invisible seeing of God, and in some sort knowing his divine goodnesse in a particular manner through the darke clouds of our humane nature, that for the most part whilst we live upon earth, hinders the cleare appearance of his Divinity from the eyes of our soule; however when our bo∣dies are once glorified, such obstacles shall vanish and disperse, without difficulty by reason of our happy condition. Our blessed Saviour himselfe hath declared, that if we had but faith as a grain of a mustard-seed, we might be able even to remove mountaines; By which figure may be conceived, the excellent nature and property of an entire be∣liefe, towards all joy and happinesse; which never∣thelesse is more or lesse purchased, according to that proportion and measure of grace, we have obtained by our devotions, and practise of vertuous actions, most apparently demonstrative in the sayings of that glorious King Lewis of France, who professed he would not goe out of his doores, to be a really eye-witnesse of any miracle whatsoever; his faith ha∣ving so absolutely confirmed him in all principles of religion, and the believing entirely every thing belonging to Gods omnipotency and goodness, that he had no need of such motives and inducements to strengthen his faith, or render it more certain and efficacious. However we may boldly affirme, that this want in the generall, is the main occasion of all mens disorders and excesses in this world. For if people did sufficiently enough (without any wave∣ring apprehension) rest upon Gods revealed will and pleasure, and by that means could absolutely
apprehend his promised mercies and judgements, it were unpossible to be so much transported with the vanities of this life. As for example, how could it be imagined, that men would be so extreamly senselesse, as for the onely enjoying and delight of a little meat and drinke, with other sensualities of this world, for a very few yeeres should violently cast away those eternall and abundantly satisfactory happinesses of Heaven, unlesse there were some stupid defect in their beliefe, concerning either the certainty of their being, or in the waies and means whereby they were to be compassed. In like manner, what per∣son would be so sottish in his resolution, as not ra∣ther to undergoe all the austerities could be under∣gone during this life, then hazzard the danger of those terrible torments so often mentioned, as I must say, to be endured to all eternity, if he were absolute∣ly convinced in his thoughts and apprehension, that they particularly belonged to his condition in each circumstance; since it is more then evident, that we forbeare no paines, or scarce omit any care in this world, either to obtaine humane honours, or prevent eminent (though earthly) inconveniencies, though we know they are but to endure for a mo∣ment in comparison of eternity; when as perhaps a farre lesse industry and travell would assure us in the other condition of a perpetuall happinesse; and yet we see it so supinely neglected by most, as if it were not at all worth any manner of consideration. Wherefore I must conclude, that mans miseries and insensibilitie for the most part proceed from this
defect in this onely particular, for that he hath not purchased a competency of grace sufficient to en∣lighten his understanding, whereby he becommeth overwhelmed, as it were, with nothing but grosse sensualities and tickling imaginations that make him wholy uncapable to converse in a higher Re∣gion, which by consequence renders him altoge∣ther unwilling to resigne himselfe entirely into the hands of Almighty God, as blessed Tobias did in all his actions and adversities. For that holy mans sted∣fast and undoubted beliefe of all the principles of Religion, made him most confident of the promises thereupon depending, which is unpossible to be effectually compassed or put in execution but by the same means he used, in the whole course of his life; whereby, as I say, he obtained such a propor∣tion of supernaturall grace, as not onely comforted him in all his extraordinary difficulties, but infused so much love into his happy soule, as he was able to contend against every temptation of the Divell, the world, and the flesh, and by that means got such a victory over all his passions, that he onely delighted in every thing that was Gods will; and of the con∣trary never seemed distasted with any crosse that was sent him. As for example, it may be supposed when he at any time found an inclination in his fraile nature to rebell against this determination, he used the power of Prayers, Fasting, and Almes∣deeds, to beat down and conquer all his humane appetites, in so much as God Almighty not onely gaue him assurance of a heavenly reward, but crow∣ned his latter daies with all the prosperity could be
imagined of earthly happinesse, as appeared by the sequell of the story, though (as it may be conceived) not more for the acts of mercy, which he had used upon all occasions to his distressed brethren, then for the absolute resignation of his own will to Gods onely pleasure and direction; in which he enjoyed no doubt a wonderfull felicity in his thoughts, not∣withstanding his desperate afflictions: Which agrees very well with the sayings of divine Thomas a Kem∣pis, who affirmeth in his booke of the imitation of Christ, that it is unpossible to purchase any manner of reall freedom, either humane or spirituall, with∣out an absolute negation of a mans own selfe. So that, when a body hath brought his resolutions into this quiet state and condition, he may truly be said to be happy, and never before; being thereby freed from all occasions of temptation, that use to swell mens minds into a thousand storms and per∣plexities; like as streames that goe along with the wind, passe smoothly without any perturbation: so of the contrary, others that strive by a naturall current, with those blasts have much difficulty to keep their course, being alwaies tossed, thwarted, and interrupted in their passage. Besides, we see the greatest Monarchs of the world are oftentimes so wearied with their own wils and command, that notwithstanding they seem exceedingly to affect glory and ambition, are perswaded in the interim not onely to put the whole government of their Dominions sometimes into the hands and power of their favourites and Subjects; but also not seldome will contradict their own very wils, to give their
intrusted Officers more absolute jurisdiction, as conceiving therein a satisfactory content to them∣selves, being thereby freed, as they suppose, of many contentions and troublesome thoughts, that else would happen to their more disquiet. Where∣fore, I say, it may be esteemed a most preposterous inconsideration in us, not to be willing to abandon our own wils to him, that we are most certaine shall alwaies be not onely constant and true to us in all our affaires, but at last can and will infinitely re∣ward us for that voluntary resignation. And this no doubt will be the easier effected, if we seriously adde this apprehension to our judgements: That let us doe what we can, and possesse what we may, either in ambition of sensuality, as we shall never be free from contention and trouble in our minds, if not in our persons, so in the end of necessity we must yield to death, the common plunderer of all these things; which taking us unprovi∣ded, will force us to interchange all our past, and so much esteemed prerogatives, into a mi∣serable and confused damnation to all eternity. And although it should take us a little more in order, and in something a better posture, yet at the best our gone and ended delights, which we enjoy∣ed according to our opinions with so much felicity, will be so farre from benefitting our present condi∣tion, that the very remembrance of those entice∣ments shall render us more sorrowfull and unwil∣ling to quit the world, however there be an absolute necessity of this separation; and at the worst they leave us burthened, and almost distracted with
many terrible feares, what accompt may be requi∣red of us towards a full satisfaction, in regard of the severe justice of Almighty God, who placed us not here to have the fruition of so many pleasures we once enjoyed above other men, notwithstanding all the delight and benefit will appeare then vanished into smoke and ayre. Insomuch as we may say, what hath it availed us, to have possessed the whole world, and foolishly to have neglected the saving of our own soules, when we had the means and oppor∣tunity to have effected it? Wherefore to summe up this discourse in a word: That man that will be wise, must first purpose well, then prosecute his re∣solution with constancy & diligence, which without doubt will procure him grace, and that grace shall enlighten and strengthen his faith, untill in the end he come to such a perfection of love, that may make him (with an assured confidence) rely entirely upon God Almighties goodnesse, by which means he may never be distasted to make a resignation of himselfe and actions into his hands, according to the exam∣ple of holy Tobias, and other religious persons; in which determination, I say, and no other, doth con∣sist not onely all future happinesse, but every pre∣sent content in the world. But perhaps it may be here said, that the cause of most mens insensibility doth not proceed so much from any deficiency of faith, as from a certain naturall inclination, to covet and desire present possession of lesse happinesse, ra∣ther then future expectations of far greater conse∣quence. Unto which I answer, that however in part I am of the same opinion, since this stupidity is inci∣dent
to humane frailty, having not obtained a suf∣ficient portion of grace; yet again when I consider how much affliction people would, and doe under∣goe for many yeeres together, onely to purchase the reversion of some earthly Kingdomes and honours in the world, I cannot but return to my old beliefe. As for example, put case a man were promised after seven yeeres extreme labour, the possession of some great Countrey, with other delights that might content his appetites; I make no question at all, but that he would most readily imbrace the offer, and conceive he had gained exceedingly by his bargain. Though yet we see for the fruition of Heaven to all eternity, we are hardly drawn by any perswasions whatsoever either morall or divine, to spend many houres in true consideration of that unconceivable joy and happinesse promised, with so much assu∣rance by God Almighty himselfe. And therefore cer∣tainly it can be nothing but a meere want of ne∣cessary faith, that renders people so carelesse of their salvation. But to conclude this part of my discourse, how∣ever we ought not, (as hath been alledged) to be directed concerning our duties in God Almighties service, by worldly events, but onely by those hea∣venly principles we have received; yet I shall hereafter make some historicall relation of many remarkable passages, perhaps more satisfactory then may be well conceived, wherein have appeared Gods apparent judgements in these latter times; though, as I say, they must not be taken for generall rules; notwithstanding they may serve for induce∣ments
to move peoples apprehensions. For indubi∣tably it is our duties without any curiosity whatso∣ever, as hath been already declared, to cast our selves wholy upon the will and pleasure of Almigh∣ty God, with an entire patience in expectation of what may happen unto us, since we have sufficient principles given us to follow proceeding from di∣vine authority; but because patience is not onely a heavenly duty, but a morall vertue necessary to be observed, I shall in the next and last Chapter dis∣course a little of the nature and benefit of such an excellent property appertaining to our humane condition, and then make an end of the first part of my book. The necessity of this noble vertue which was pra∣ctised by our Saviour himselfe in a most particu∣lar manner during his abode upon earth. AS this Heroicall vertue of Patience is little lesse necessary then faith to perfect our con∣dition, at least wise to be used in some convenient measure and proportion, for that humane frailty cannot easily arrive to the highest perfections of this nature; so is it more then evident by the sacred writings and testimony of holy Scripture, that our Saviour Jesus Christ in a most exact way during his being in this world, did offer himselfe as a divine pattern for example to instruct our endeavours con∣cerning
what we ought to doe in this particular; for when it was his blessed pleasure to joyn his eternall Divinity with the mortall substance of our flesh and blood, he tooke upon him almost the lowest of all conditions, as I may say, being born of no other then of a simple Virgin, however extracted from the loyns of Kings, because it was determined that Da∣vid his beloved servant should have the honour of his birth; and this holy mayd was onely married to a poore Carpenter, that got his necessitous living meerly by the sweat of his owne browes, though he might have chosen for his mother the greatest Queen or Empresse in the world; which certainly he did for no other reason, but by this penurious condition to have occasion thereby the better to ex∣ercise visibly his own designed patience for our ex∣ample and instruction. Neither did he designe his miraculous birth to be in any other place then in a base and contemptible stable, not furnished with any kind of commodity, either for himselfe or com∣pany. Again, if we reflect upon his many persecu∣tions, both under Herod, and by his unnaturall Countreymen, we shall finde that he underwent them with a most singular patience, both of minde and body; never expressing the least passion in his words, notwithhandling all the injuries and affronts offered unto him; or shewed want of courage in enduring what vexations or tortures soever could be inflicted upon him; insomuch as he suffered him∣selfe to be stroke, spit upon, and used with other un∣paraleld indignities, by most base and contemptible creatures; not onely without any manner of oppo∣sition,
but scarce reproving them in what kinde of fashion soever, either by word or action, untill being with these and the like sufferings brought to the last period of his miseries to endure a most cruel and ignominious death upon the Crosse; he was so farre from not expressing an entire and absolute patience in his extreamest agony, that instead of shewing forth any signes of passion or perturbation, he took care for his mothers future welfare, as a morall obligation belonging to his humanity; he gave pardon to the Thiefe that was crucified with him, as an essential property appertaining to his Divi∣nity; and last of all, as evident testimonies of his admirable and heavenly charity, he most earnestly prayed for those barbarous enemies that so earnest∣ly did persecute him at that very instant, as preten∣ding in their behalfe to his Father, they did not understand what they did concerning his particu∣ler. Of the other side, if we cast our thoughts upon those instructions he gave his Apostles and other followers, they were alwaies either to perswade hu∣mility, or command patience, which are two ver∣tues that cannot well be separated. As for exam∣ple, he bid them, when they were persecuted in one City, to fly to another; without contention, although they had his heavenly Commission for their better authority. As also, in his frequent Sermons, for their particular instructions and effectuall edifica∣tions, he commanded them as an absolute duty be∣longing to their vocation, being his Disciples, to suffer those that used violence to their persons, not∣withstanding to expresse so much patience, that if
they did take away their cloaks from them, they should permit them to bereave them also of their coates without resistance. In like manner he told them, that whoever should injuriously give them a blow upon the ear, rather then return a requital in the same nature, after the custom of the world, they must offer the other part of their face, to be abused by their injustice. 'Tis true as I cannot affirm, we are obliged to these strict and severe rules of pati∣ence in all our actions, especially since such suffer∣ing would probably incourage Tyranny in wicked dispositions, yet certainly these very examples are sufficient demonstrations, of God Almighties inten∣tions in the general, concerning this necessary ver∣tue, to be practised upon all convenient occa∣sions, in our ordinary conversation amongst men, as well as to be put in practise in those afflictions, which accidentally at any time shall be cast upon our condition; and the rather for that it is evident, that the sinnes and disorders of the world, for the most part, proceed from a certain intemperancy or impatiency of nature, not sufficiently rectified by Grace or wisdome. As for the purpose; Pride is nothing but an over swelling humour of self esteem, not governed by Reason, or bounded by Charity; which causeth such an unruly and passionate inflammation in the soul, as we neither know rightly our own state, or willingly would endure what we should from ano∣ther. Also envy is a passionate and malevolent spight against our neighbours prosperity; as fearing left it might prejudice our estimation. Revenge
is a bloody and impatient passion, because our na∣ture is not passive enough in bearing of injuries; Vainglory may be termed a lunatick indiscretion, proceeding from too much abundancy of self-love. Disobediency in like manner, a presumptuous Pride that allowes us not sufficient temper to be under subjection, although it be never so necessary for our condition. Ingratitude, an unjust intemperancy that renders us unwilling to acknowledge an others vertues, in regard we doubt too much thereby to be disvalued our selves; or else to be put to more re∣quitals then seems convenient for our own interest. Ambition a mad overflowing of the minde towards those honours, that we conceive might give us lustre and esteem in the eye of the world. Covetousness a certain raging desire without end, to be possessors of we know not what; since we never enjoy the half of what we cover, when best obtained. Of the other side, if we turn our consideration upon the sensuality of the body, we shall finde it general∣ly to proceed for want of sufficient temperance in the suffering part, as the other concerning the minde, proceeds from the defect of not being able competently to expect the event of things to come; for when we drown our selves in a vast sea of luxu∣ry, against Reason, Religion, and morality, it is be∣cause the consideration of honour or vertuous acti∣ons, carries not our thoughts and resolutions high enough to contemn such poore and base pleasures, that neither secure our condition or benefit our per∣sons. As for example, what is gluttony, but an in∣ordinate striving by the instinct of nature, to satisfie
the senses in eating and drinking? Lust in the same kinde an impatient itching after unlawful novel∣ties, however consisting most in opinion, for that oftentimes our deceived fancy, makes choice of the far unworthier subject, as I have already instanced in a part of my Book. Again, Idlenesse is nothing else but a certain kinde of impatiency, proceeding from a loathnesse to enter upon action and employ∣ment. Sloth in like manner is but a heavy increase of the same humour, towards a more earthly peri∣od, engendred by custome and continuance. In∣constancy another palpable effect of impatiency, in regard it varies from one fancy to another, with a restlesse longing to be yet satisfied in something, that the judgement cannot reach unto for want of temperance to consider. For however I am not of the opinion of those fantastical Philosophers, that esteemed pain little more then imagination, yet when I consider the wonderful strange lives of many holy people in the primitive times, I may easily be induced to be∣lieve, that a perfect and absolute patience being procured, which can no otherwise be obtained then by a religious morality, it will not be very difficult to run through the rough passages of this world, in a manner in an absolute calm and tranquility; espe∣cially when I reflect upon the actions of many Hea∣thens, who onely out of the spirit of vain-glory, seemed in outward view so to have conquered all their passions, that they appeared carelesse of life or death, honour or riches, eating, drinking, or any other earthly pleasure or pain whatsoever. How∣ever
I will leave these reports to the uncertainty of History, or at least wise believe they might proceed from enchantments of pride and the devils elusions; since we know their Religion could not procure simply such effects, not being justified either by di∣vine Revelation or assured principles. Wherefore, for a conclusion, I shall make some brief mention of a few admirable people in those times, whose cou∣rages never failed in adversity, or any vain-glory laid the least hold of their actions in suffering: To which purpose, we may begin with the considerati∣on of Paul the Hermite, that lived almost a hundred yeers without seeing or conversing with any hu∣mane person, in an obscure Cave incompassed with Rocks and Mountains, his employment being Pray∣ers, his recreation Meditation, and his practise fast∣ing. Again, we may call to mind the wonderful and admirable austerities of Simeon Stilitto, that li∣ved in a small piller of stone many Cubits from the ground, for thirty seven yeers together, scarce in all that time reposing his body, according to the custom of other people; insomuch as it is written, that mul∣titudes of wormes, proceeding from the natural cor∣ruption of the place, bred and ingendred under his feet, for want of motion and agitation; and yet his humility notwithstanding was so great, that when he was commanded to descend, by the Bishop of Antioch to try his obedience, without any manner of delay, he yeelded himself ready to perform the in∣junction; as it were adding the vertue of subjecting his own will to that of patience, which he so exact∣ly practised. We read that Mary of Egypt, conti∣nued
in the wild Desarts of Syria for seven and twenty yeers, without any clothing at all, or other sustenance, then what she could gather from the Sands and Rocks of that extraordinary solitude, where perchance she found now and then some green herbs for her necessary food. Last of all, if we reflect upon the horrid torments, which Lawrence the Deacon endured under Decius the Emperour, we shall finde matter enough to contemplate with ad∣miration, both his patience and courage; for whilst his body in the night time, for the greater terrour to his youth, was laid upon an Iron Gridiron, over a hot and scorching fire, he cryed out to the Tyrant, being more then half dead, that now he was rosted sufficiently of one side, he might if he pleased also turn the other to participate in like manner of his cruelty; which words gained so absolute a victory over all his persecutors, that the Emperour confoun∣ded both with shame and amazement, quitted the place of his execution. All which I may boldly affirm, were no other then wonderful effects of a constant and couragious patience. Since of the o∣ther side, many esteemed gallant persons of this world failing in this vertue, have disgraced their last ends by apparant dejection of their souls. As for example, Philotus, who was famed in Alexanders Ar∣my for one of his prime Commanders, that follow∣ed his fortune and successe; yet being by accident brought upon the torture, notwithstanding his in∣temperate vainglory, had made him promise to him∣self, and pretend to others, that his courage main∣tained the Kings greatnesse in most of his conquests,
and victories in Asia, he was brought to such a low∣nesse of Spirit, by the violence of torments, that he not onely revealed his own intentions, but accused his old Father, to be released of his punishment, for want of fortitude and patience in his sufferings; in¦somuch, as Alexander himself being concealedly pre∣sent at his Tryal, delivered this opinion of his car∣riage, that he wondred how such a man had so much boldnesse to attempt his life, that had not a heart great enough to expresse more courage at his own death. Nero, however he had a nature infla∣med with impatiency, pride and vain-glory; joyn∣ed also with the condition of an Emperour, that probably, should have raised his soul to an eminen∣cy of courage and magnanimity, yet when the Se∣nate of Rome by reason of his own wickednesse, and his enemies prevailing power, had designed him a most shameful and ignominious execution, could not by any perswasion be brought to kill himself to avoid that disgraceful fare, until one of his follow∣ers and intimate friends, shewed him the way by acting the like upon his own person before his face; which shewes that intemperate prosperity is rather an impediment to same and reputation, then a mild and quiet patience; that for the most part enableth people to suffer any thing can well be inflicted upon their condition, when either their Religion or ho∣nour calleth them to such a combate. Also Marshal Byron of France, being not onely one of the great fa∣vourites to Harry the fourth, by reason of his sup∣posed courage, but esteemed of an extraordinary passionate valour in the wars; yet after his accusa∣tion,
when he was brought upon the Scaffold to die by the hands of the common Executioner, he ex∣prest so much unwillingnesse to leave his life, by a wild and preposterous rage, that the Hang-man was constrained to perform his office when he least thought of the businesse, onely to avoid a greater indignity to be done to his person in the last end; whereas if he had put on a mild temperance in his suffering, he would not onely probably have better secured his future condition, but in a far higher na∣ture have preserved his honour and reputation. Last of all, we have an example of this kinde, in the death and suffering of a noble man of our Country, who in his life was passionately vain-glorious and active beyond measure, yet at his execution he ap∣peared so passively fearful, that he seemed more then half dead, before the executioners stroke arrived at his neck. All which I say, may be brought for te∣stimonies, against those dispositions that neither re∣solve or practise patience, seeing that noble proper∣ty for the most part renders men absolutely victori∣ous in most things of this world; for who can stile themselves Masters in this beneficial and heavenly vertue, shall smile at Tyranny, overcome cruelty, suppresse passions, contemn accidents, purchase friends, perswade enemies, live contentedly, and die happily; And in truth may be said to have made a wise and generous preparation, against all disasters whatsoever, which either the devil or the world can raise against our humane condition; for however it be true, that the sensualities of nature cannot easily be overcome, but by the dominion of
Grace, yet since the very heathens, meerly by the instinct and provation of honour, have in many con∣flicts obtained wonderful victories by their constant and patient resolutions, it cannot be but a shame and ignominy to us Christians, not to be able by the addition of heavenly Grace (which certainly we may compasse by our religious endeavours if we will) to beat down, and suppresse both in our thoughts and actions, those violent passions that de∣prive us of all reputation and goodnesse. Since in doing the contrary, we do participate of the nature of those unreasonable creatures, that have no other rule for their subsistence but meerly sense, which without doubt, being in us cherished extraordinari∣ly, totally destroyes the nobility of the soul, that ought onely, or at leastwise chiefly to contemplate and be in love with supernatural and divine things, and by consequence to leave dull cogitations and grosse actions, for supplements of necessity or con∣veniency; which being considered and put in pra∣ctice, with a constant and noble resolution, we shall finde such a beneficial patience daily to encrease in our natures and dispositions, that will easily gain a signal victory over all obstacles and difficulties, and render us not onely temperate in expectation, but invincible in suffering. In fine, I am of opinion, that as want of patience is a deficiency of courage, so was there never yet an excellent Saint lived in the world, but that he was endued with a great Spi∣rit by nature, for whosoever is altogether carelesse in his▪ thoughts of honour and reputation, for my part, I shall have no extraordinary confidence either
of his devotion or Religion. In conclusion, a noble patience in to be esteemed exceedingly; for by it we do not onely affront every adversity, but by the discreet practice of that excellent vertue, we make our selves more capable upon all occasions of pro∣sperity, since we are not apt at any time to fall from that temper and understanding that should both warrant and instruct us in our most beneficial affairs, either belonging to this life or to eternity. Which certainly is no way so well to be purchased, as by a constant and resolved activity; for however pati∣ence may seem onely a passive quality, in regard it belongs most to suffering, yet if the imagination be too much setled for want of industry and imploy∣ment, probably it will ingender those thoughts and desires that tast most of natural sensuality, and so by consequence draw people to a kinde of a bodi∣ly indulgency, which of necessity either destroyes or lessens the magnanimity of the soul, and by that means cannot but procure an impatiency, and irk∣somenesse in all accidental sufferings whatsoever. But here perhaps it may be thought too hard a con∣dition imposed upon humane nature to be to suffer, whereas God Almighty out of his infinite mercy, might have created man in in such a state, as he should have had no need at all of the use of pati∣ence; unto which I shall onely say, that as it doth not stand with Gods heavenly justice, that any crea∣ture should eyjoy that perfect happinesse belonging to the blessed, without having first given some testi∣mony of endeavour in this world. So of the other side, though we had not injunctions and commands
to this purpose, yet it is most evident that a certain kind of Tryal belongs to all manner of creatures, before they can arrive at the uttermost period of their designed happinesse. As for example, the blessed Angels were constrained to encounter with Lucifer and his adherents, ere they could be perfect∣ly established in a perpetual Throne of glory with full security. Also Adam was placed in Paradise, (however in an innocent condition) to contend with his passions and appetites before he was to have enjoyed Heaven, who fayling in this combat appointed him by the inserutable decrees of Al∣mighty God, he determined to send his son into the world to expiate the offence by suffering also; And yet man again was ordered to new Trials in this pilgrimage of life, ere he could compasse the accom∣plishments of eternal rest and quietnesse, constitu∣ted for his benefit and felicity. So that we may in∣dubitably conclude, without a resolved and pra∣ctised patience, it is unpossible either to please God, or almost to satisfie a mans self. For as long as we live in this habitation of misery, we must alwayes either suffer or expect. But being so prepared, we may without overmuch difficulty, undergo persecu∣tions, long Prayers, sharp Fastings continual watch∣ings, with the losse of what prosperity soever upon earth; since it is onely our natural impatiency, that makes all austerities and afflictions be entertained with so much horrour in our imagination, in regard (as I have said before) they consist chiefly, though not totally in opinion. For as the apprehension of honour, is no other, well considered, then an indul∣gency,
created in our natures for want of judge∣ment; and so consequently we cannot without perturbation in our mindes, bear the deprivation thereof, so may we be confident, that all pain and suffering whatsoever, is much abated by a constant resolution of patience, besides the benefit it affords us in judiciously considering wayes, either for the short continuance of our misfortunes, in temporal things, or the happy use may be made of our afflicti∣ons in spiritual matters. Which patience in fine, I call a discreet and noble fortitude, either in expe∣cting or sustaining. FINIS.
