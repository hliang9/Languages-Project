C R DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms By the King. A PROCLAMATION, FOR Restraint of Killing, Dressing and Eating of Flesh in Lent, or on Fish-dayes appointed by the Law to be observed. CHARLES R. WHereas divers good Laws and Statutes have heretofore with great care and providence been made and Enacted for the due observation of Lent, and other days appointed for Fish-days, as well for the sparing and increase of Flesh-Victuals, as for the maintenance of the Navy, and Shipping of this Realm, by the encouragement of Fishermen to go to the Seas for the taking of Fish; which Laws and Politique Constitutions have heretofore been quickned by sundry Proclamations, and other Acts and Ordinances of State, in the times of Our Royal Predecessors, and by a Proclamation set forth by Vs the Twenty ninth of January last. And whereas notwithstanding so many good Provisions heretofore had and made in that kinde, all sorts of people have for many years last past, taken upon them such a liberty to kill, dress, and eat flesh in the Lent season, and on other days and times prohibited, as now it is become so inveterate, and evil, that it will require more then ordinary care to redress the same: We therefore much affecting the re∣formation of so great and growing an evil, which is so great an enemy to the plenty of this Our King∣dom, have thought fit thus timely (the better to take away all pretences of excuse) to express Our Self and Our Royal Commandment in this behalf; whereof We shall expect, and do require from all Our loving Subjects, that due notice be taken, and that a strict conformity be yielded thereunto. And for a∣voiding of inconveniences hereafter, Our will and pleasure is, that the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, and the Iustices of Peace of Our City of Westminster, and the Liberties thereof, shall hereaf∣ter
yearly, every year before Lent, or at the beginning thereof, cause all Inholders, Keepers of ordinary Tables, Cooks, Butchers, Victuallers, Alehouse-keepers and Taverners within the said Cities and Liberties thereof, to appear before them, and shall take Recognizances, with two sufficient Sureties of every of them (viz.) the Principal in Forty pounds, and their Sureties in Twenty pounds apiece to Our use, That the Butchers shall kill no flesh in Lent, and that the other persons before mentioned, shall not dress, nor suffer any flesh to be eaten in their houses in the Lent time, or at any time prohibited, contrary to Law. And to the end that Fishermen may imploy themselves at Sea with better encouragement then heretofore, and that the Fishmongers may furnish themselves with such store from time to time hereaf∣ter, as shall be expedient, as well for the provision of the City, as for selling the same at reasonable rates, We will that they take notice of this Our Commandment, and constant resolution for observance of Lent, and Fish-days, both now and hereafter, as by Law is required. And furthermore, as We think it fit that every man should be a rule of order and abstinence in his own house, as well in respect of the publique, as of his private ease and benefit; so We streightly Charge and Command all Inholders, Keepers of ordinary Tables, Poulterers, Victuallers, Cooks, Alehouse-keep∣ers, and Taverners, not to make any Supper for any person or persons whatsoever upon Friday nights, either in Lent or out of Lent, nor suffer any meat to be then dressed, uttered, sold, or eaten in their houses, upon pain of such punishment as is due to those that shall contemn Our Royal Pleasure and Command∣ment, and as by due course of the Laws may be inflicted. And forasmuch as upon further advice and consideration had of this inconveniency, which too much liberty hath occasioned, We conceive that the re∣straint of Killing and Dressing of Flesh is no sufficient remedy alone for these mischiefs, unless there be better care also taken to suppress the unlawful and inordinate eating of Flesh in the time of Lent, and on other days and times prohibited, wherewith Our Subjects have for several years past accustomed themselves, rather for delicacy then for necessity: It is therefore Our Royal Will and Pleasure, and accordingly We do hereby streightly prohibit, and forbid all Our Subjects of what degree or quality soe∣ver within this Realm, to eat any manner of Flesh in the time of Lent, or on other days, now usually observed as Fish-days, without a special Licence first obtained from the Bishop of the Diocess, or such other as by the Law have power to give Licence in that behalf, according to Our Laws in that case provided, which We Will and Command shall be sparingly granted. And as these Our Orders are to be executed in Our Cities of London and Westminster, and the places near to the same: so it is Our express Pleasure and Commandment, that Our Iustices of Peace in all Shires within their Rule, and all other Mayors, Bayliffs, and chief Officers in Towns Corporate, or in any Liberties within their Precincts, shall cause the same to be observed and performed in like manner; further Charging and Commanding the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, the Iusti∣ces of Assize in their several Circuits, the Mayors and chief Officers of all other Cities, and Towns Corporate, Iustices of Peace, Lords of Liberties, and all other Officers and Ministers within the several Counties of this Our Realm, that they and every of them fully obey this Our Pleasure, and cause the same to be obeyed and executed by others, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perils. And for the due execution of the premises in all other the Counties of this Our Realm, as well as in Our Cities of London and Westminster, We do hereby streightly Charge and Command all Our Iustices of Peace within the same Counties, as well within Liberties as without, that yearly, and every year hereaf∣ter before Lent, they cause to come and appear before them, all keepers of ordinary Tables, Inholders, Poulterers, Cooks, Taverners, Alehouse-keepers, Butchers, and other Victuallers whatsoever, and to require and take of them to Our use several Recognizances, with Sureties for the observation of the pre∣mises; (viz.) the Principals in Ten pounds, and their two Sureties in Five pounds apiece. And if they shall refuse or neglect to enter into such Recognizances, then the said Iustices shall suppress such persons so refu∣sing
from Victualling any more, and shall also cause them forthwith to become bound by Recognizance with Sureties to Our use: (viz.) The Principals in Twenty pounds, and their two Sureties in Ten pounds apiece, not to Victual, or sell Beer, or Ale from henceforth; which if they shall refuse to do, then the said Iu∣stices to commit to Prison all such persons so refusing to enter into such Recognizances, until they shall sub∣mit themselves and become bound as aforesaid. And further all such Keepers of ordinary Tables, Inhold∣ers, Cooks, Taverners, Alehouse-keepers, Butchers, and other Victuallers as shall not appear before the said Iustices as aforesaid, That they may immediately send forth their Warrants, or grant Processe against them, and every of them so making default, to appear and answer their contempt at the next general Sessions of the Peace. And further for the more due punishment of Inholders, Keepers of ordinary Tables, Poulterers, Cooks, Butchers, Victuallers, Alehouse-keepers, Taverners, and such like, who shall forfeit their Recognizances by Killing and Dressing of Flesh, or suffering it to be eaten in their houses, in the Lent-time, and other Fish-dayes; and to the end that the same may be as well taken in due form of Law, as duely certified into Our Exchequer; We do will and require all Iustices of Peace, as well within Li∣berties as without, that at such times as they shall meet within their several Divisions for the taking of such Recognizances, that they give notice to the Clerk of the Peace or their Deputies, whom We do here∣by appoint to take the said Recognizances, to attend them for that purpose, of whom We Will and require a strict account, for the legal taking and returning of the same Recognizances into Our said Exchequer. And because these directions are for the better Observation of Order, and due keeping of the Lent, accord∣ing to Our Lawes, which Our Ministers and Officers are to see executed of Office, without making the same grievous unto Our people, by taking of excessive Fees, for their entring into Recognizances to ob∣serve these Orders; We therefore streightly Charge and Command, That no Town-Clerk, Clerk of the Peace, or other Officer shall or do presume to demand, or take any Fees or reward above the summe of Twelve pence, although more hath been heretofore limited to be taken by the Town-Clerks, and Clerks of the Peace of the several Counties, for taking and certifying any such Recognizances, nor shall give any Fee or reward for returning the same into Our Exchequer. And lastly for that the Fishmongers (upon the observation of the aforesaid Orders) may perhaps take occasion thereby to inhannce the prices as well of Fresh, as Sea-fish); We do therefore hereby further Charge and Command all Fishmongers whatsoever, That they sell and utter their Fish at moderate and usual rates and prices. And that all Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Officers, as well within Liberties as without, to whom it shall appertain, shall from time to time take such Order with the said Fishmongers, that Our Subjects be not grieved by any such inhauncement, or in∣crease of prices upon Fish, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such further punishment as may be in∣flicted upon them by Our Lawes. Given at Our Court at Whitehall,this Eleventh day of November, 1661. in the Thirteenth Year of Our Reign. GOD SAƲE THE KING.
