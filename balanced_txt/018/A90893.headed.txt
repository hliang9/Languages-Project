CHRIST and MOSES Excellency, OR Sion and Sinai's Glory. BEING A Triplex Treatise, distinguishing and explaining the TWO COVENANTS or the Gospel and Law: AND Directing to the right understanding applying, and finding of the Informing and Assuring Promises, that be∣long to both Covenants. By VAVASOR POVVELL, Preacher of the Gospel in Wales. Joh. 1.17. The Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ. Gal. 3.21. Is the Law then against the Promises of God? God forbid. LONDON, Printed by R. I. for Hannah Allen, at the Crown in Popes head-Alley, 1650.
To the courteous and Christian READER. Reader, THis little Book is divided into three parts, and it treats orderly of three things; to wit, of the Co∣venant of grace, of the Covenant of works, and of the promises belong∣ing to both. In the two first parts is handled most, or all, of the materiall Questions about the Gospel, and Law; also the Intent, extent, and efficacie of the death of Christ; to∣gether with the Scriptures that de∣clare the same, and the Objections that are made about the universali∣ty thereof. In the last Part are seve∣ral things concerning the dividing, understanding, and applying of the Promises: with an easie and
speedy way how to finde all, or most, promises in the Bible alphabetically Though there be severall books ex∣tant, some upon the Gospel and Law, and others particularly upon the Promises; yet, I hope, I may truly, and without ostentation affirm, that this hath the sum of most of them, & somwhat more then any of them, especially concerning the Promises, (about which I have taken no smal paines) where, besides sever all other things, there areSee pag. 260. &c. forty five Rules, gathered out of the Scriptures, for to give light therein; also the pro∣mises made toSee pag. 269. Christ personally, by themselves in severall particulars: and the promises made to theAs pag. 271, &c. Jews whilst they were formerly a Church: Likewise the promises that concern theAs Pag. 275. &c. Jewes hereaster, when they are called and converted; and these under distinct and severall heads. The third Part of this book (to wit,
that upon the Promises) may serve for a double use. First, as a small Concordance, where you may find proofes (especially those of the nature of promises) for most material points in Scripture. Secondly, this may serve for to help you to find Promises for any thing you desire (and which is to be found in the Scripture) and that instantly, without looking in the Table to the book, (for that rea∣ches no further then the promises) As for example, to find Promises of faith. See the word Faith in the margin of pag. 331. so of any other word. Object. But it may bee you will say, There were severall Books extant before, that did direct us to find the Promises. Answ. It is very true, that o∣ther (and far more able) men then my selfe, have done exceeding well herein; yet to use the expression of one of them:
That a child upon a Gyants shoul∣ders, can see further then the Gy∣ant: So I, having the help of their la∣bours herein, and of other bookes, (but e∣specially by a frequent, thorow, and dili∣gent search of Gods Book) I have by the Lords light and Spirit, seen and set down (without vaine-glory be it mentioned) more Promises, (by severall scores accor∣ding to comparison and computati∣on) and in a more distinct and easie way to finde, then others have (to my under∣standing) done before me, Observe but these few Rules, and I will leave thee to tryall. 1 I doe divide the Promises into two ranks or sorts, to wit, informing, and assuring Promises, and the diffe∣rence I make between them, is this; that the informing Promises (which are upon the left side of the page) doe not speake directly, and patly, but by way of in∣formation but the Assuring Promises speak directs, (and those are the chiefest Promises.) As for instance, in the word pardon, pag. 404. in the Informing Promises in Nth. 9.17. God is said, to be ready to pardon. But in the
Assuring Promises in Jer. 33.8. God saith I will pardon all their iniquities. 2 Ʋnderstand that there are not In∣forming and Assuring promises under every word. As for example, in the word glory, there are no Assuring (or direct) Promises: So in the word finde there are no Informing Promises. 3 There are severall things, or heads, under one word. As for example, under the word receive there are six distinct things, so under the word save. 4 Where you finde but few Promises, or sometimes but one Promise under a word, know that there is no more in the Bible belonging to that word, as in the word Peace-makers. 5 Note that severall words are of the same signification, and if you find not many, or several Promises in one word, turn and see in another: as in the word Assurance; See there is know, faith, beleeve, confident. 6 Observe that sometime words that give light or testimony to a oint (though they doe not sound like Pmises, yet they) are set downe as Promiss, As in the word kindnesse.
7 Search for the Promises here, and then read them in Gods owne Book, and labour to get the Promises (especially the chiefe ones, and those that are of spiritu∣all, and speciall concernment) by heart. Loving Reader, having held thee thus long in the Porch, I invite thee into the house; but I am sorry that this book is so big, and I fear, deare (but not dearer by any Merchandize I have made of it,) but its not so dear to thee, as to me, it ha∣ving cost me many nights study, because I would not neglect for the Printing of a thousand Books, the preaching of one Ser∣mon. I intended this onely for a private (yet worthy) Gentleman, who by many severall motions and courtesies put me on. I wish him and thee as much good in rea∣ding, as I had in stuching and writing it; And this shall be the prayer of one of the Lords meanest Saints, and in him thy servant, for thy soules good. V. Powell.

Christ and Moses Excellency, OR, Sion and Sinai's Glory. Question. HOw many Covenants did God make with men concerning their salvation?Gal. 4.24 Rom 9.4. Eph. 2.12. Answer, Two, Gal. 4.24. Rom. 9.4. Ephes. 2.12. Quest. How are these two Covenants called? Answ. TheMat. 11.5 Gospell, and theJoh. 1.16. law, or commonly the Cove∣nant ofAc. 20.32 grace and the Covenant ofRo. 3.24. works.
Quest. Why doe you place the Cove∣nant of grace before the Covenant of workes? Answ. Because the Covenant of grace was in beingGal. 3.17. before the Covenant of works. Q. What do you mean by the Cove∣nant of workes? A. I mean theDeu. 10.4 ten Comman∣dements (called theMal. 4.4 Law of Moses) which was delivered uponDeu. 29.1. Mount Horch (orGal. 4.24. Synai) unto Moses for the children of Israel. Q. Doe you then take the ten Com∣mandements for the Covenant of works? A. Yea sure, and they are of∣ten in Scripture called aDeu. 4.13.5.23. Is. 24 5. Jer. 31.32 Heb. 8.9. Cove∣nant. Q. But was not that, the Covenant of works, which God made with Adam in Paradise before his fall? A. I deny not, but that it was of the nature of aHos. 6.7. Like Adam they trans∣gressed the Covenant. Covenant, yet we find no more expressed, but a com∣mandGen. 2.17. doe this and live, with a penalty, In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye, but there is no pro∣mise
made of eternal salvation up∣on the keeping of it. Q. But do not you conceive that God did intend to give salvation unto Adam if he had kept that command, though God did not expresly promise it. A. I doe conceive that Adam should have continued in that happy state, he was in, and should never have dyed, if he had not sin∣ned, forRo. 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.21 by sin came death. Q. What might be the reason, why God did not declare as well the promise, as the command and penalty? A. Though this be a secret, and known perfectly, onely to God himselfe, yet we may judge pro∣bably by the event, that God reser∣ved, and kept secret to himselfe, that part of his mind which con∣cerned Adams eternall salvation, because he intended not that Adam should be saved by his works. Q. How does it appear that God did not intend to save Adam by his works? A. Because God had pre-or∣dained, determined, and appoin∣ted
anotherEph. 1.3, 4, 5. 2 Tim 1.9, 2 Thes. 2, 13. Rev. 13.8.17.8. way and means (viz. Jesus Christ) to save Adam and part of his posterity. Q. If God had pre-ordained Christ as the means of mens salvation, was there not then a necessity that Adam should sin. A. Although God put no neces∣sity upon Adam to sinne, but left him to his free choice, yet there was a necessity of bringing to light that heavenly plot, and contrive∣ment, wherein lay hid the mystery of Gods counsell, and the won∣derment of mens salvation, which could not be revealed untill Adam had sinned: and so (with reverence be it mentioned) the Son of man gave vent unto the grace of God, and the fall of naturall Adam, to the exaltation of spirituall Adam, Jesus Christ. Q. But was there any agreement a∣bout the salvation of men before Adam sinned? A. Yes, there was an agreement and CovenantEs. 42.6.55.3 Zac. 6.13. Es. 50 5, 6. betweene God
the father, & hisWho was then the word of God, Joh. 1.1. Son Jesus Christ. Q. When was that Covenant made with Jesus Christ? A.Tit. 1.2. 2 Tim. 1.9. Before the world began. Objection, But is it not in the Greek, from the foundation or beginning of the world, meaning that the Covenant was made with Adam, immediatly af∣ter his fall, and not with Christ before the foundation of the world? A. The Greeke will not beare it so, for  (which are the words in both places before cited) signifie, before the foundation of the world, or begin∣ings of times, for note that the preposition  when it governes a Genitive Case (as here it doth) it signifies before, as, 1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Cor. 4 5. 2 Tim. 4.21. so Ephes. 1.4.1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Cor 4.5. 2 Tim. 4.21 Eph. 14. we are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (the word before there is in Greek ) if e∣lection be before the foundation of the world (as sure it is) then al∣so by the same ground a Covenant or promise, is made before the foun∣dation
of the world, for the word proves the one as well as the other. Q. But where in Scripture doe you finde that agreement (if there were any) made with Christ before the foundation of the world, called a Covenant? A. I suppose the word Covenant, could not be found in Scripture (in this sense and case) yet if there be found words of the same signi∣fication, and holding forth the truth of the thing it is sufficient, (for many words are used by the godly and learned, which are not in Scripture (as Trinity, Sacra∣ment, &c.) now in Scripture it is called theTit. 1.2. the promise of eter∣nall life, and so is the Covenant that God made with Abraham cal∣led theGal. 3.18 19, 22. promise. 2. We have the word Covenant applyed in this case, as in Zach. 9.11. As for thee by the bloud of thy Co∣venant, or whose Covenant is by blood: here God the Father speakes to Christ, with relation to some Co∣venant between them both; and
we read of no other but this fore-spoken of.Psa. 89.28 Also in Psal. 89.28. God the Father saith againe, My Cove∣nant shall stand fast with him, i.e. with Christ, if you consider (1) v. 25. he saith that he would set his hand (or power) in the Sea, that is, Christ should have power to go∣verne the Nations (2) v. 27. he is called, Gods first begotten son, a title most properly given to Christ, Rom. 8.29. Col. 1.15. (3) v. 29.Rom. 8.29 Col. 1.15. His seed should endure for ever, meaning the members of Christ, which are so called in Esa. 53.10.Esa. 53.10 Obj. In verse 35. it is, I have sworne that I will not lie unto David, therefore this Covenant was made with David, and his seed, i.e. Solomon, and not with Christ and his seed. A. Jesus Christ is calledEsa. 22.22. Ezek. 37.24. Hos. 3.5. David frequently in Scripture, be∣cause he was made of theRo. 1.3 Called the branch of David, Jer. 23.6. Mat. 1.1. because he sprang from Dav. seed of David according to the flesh, though it be true, that God made a Covenant with David, and his seed or son Solomon, and that this
Psalme in the letter of it, hath re∣lation thereunto; yet Solomons Throne did not endure for ever, but wasJer. 22.30 Ez. 21.16 overthrowne, there∣fore sure this is to be applied onely to Christ, and his spirituall seed according to the strict and spi∣rituall meaning of the words. Quest. To what end should the Co∣venant of Grace be made before man stood in need of grace, for till Adam had sinned, there was no necessity, or misery, requiring grace or mercy? Answ.Act. 15.18 Known to God are all his workes, from (or before) the beginning of the world, and hee had all things then, as present, and as reall before the eyes of his glo∣ry as now he hath, viz. mans crea∣tion, fall, and recovery, and in this sense there was no precedency of time in regard of any of Gods counsells, or secret acts. More∣over, God fore-seeing that man would sinne (and thereby stand in need of Grace) hee prepared this sovereigne salve (Christ or the pro∣mise
of life and grace) to be pre∣sently applied, and clapped to this wounded dying man; as the brazen Serpent was prepared, andNum. 21 8, 9. set up before-hand for them that should afterwards be stung. Q. What was the nature of that. Co∣venant which God the Father made with Jesus Christ? A. It was aJoh. 6 39 40. Heb. 10.7. voluntary,Eph. 1.5. well-pleasing, andEs. 53.10 11. mutuall act, and agreement, betweene the Fa∣ther, and his Son Jesus Christ, such as a man makes with hisEph. 1.9 owne minde, concerning his owne chil∣dren, or members. Q. Who were the parties concerned in this Covenant? A. God the Father,Esa. 42.1 Jesus Christ the Mediator, and theGal. 3.16. called Christ 1 Cor. 12.12. Church or body of Christ, for whom he was to mediate. Q. What did God the Father then promise unto Christ on his part? A. They were either things that did belong to the worke of his Mediatorship, or things to gratifie
and satisfie him, for his worke of Mediation, Q. What were those things that God the Father did promise Christ, as belon∣ging to the worke of his Mediation? A. That he wouldHeb. 1.9 annoynt him, andEsa. 11.2. fill him, with the Spi∣rit above all others, andHeb. 10.5.10. fit him with a body, to sacrifice for sins: andEsa. 42.1. uphold andEsa. 42.6.50.5. strengthen him, that he should not beEsa. 50 7 confounded, nor ashamed, by the things he suffered. Q. What were those things which God the Father promised Jesus Christ in way of gratification, and satisfacti∣on, for the worke of his mediation? A. That he wouldEsa. 50.8 justifie, and glorifie him,Joh. 17.22 24. and allEsa. 53.11 his seed, and that he shouldEsa. 53.10 Heb. 2.7.10. see, andEph 5 25 27. enjoy, the travell, and pur∣chase of his soule and body; and haveMat. 28.18 all power in heaven, and in earth, given to him, till all things be1 Cor. 15.28. subdued unto him, and when God must bee all in all.
Q. What was the summe of the Co∣venant promised, and to be performed on Christs part? A. To become aHeb 8.6. Mediator,Heb. 7.22 Surety, andAct. 13.23 Saviour for all those that his Father shouldJoh. 17.11, 12. give him, and in the Fathers ap∣pointed time, to become flesh,Gal. 4 4. for toMat. 11.27 manifest andJoh. 17.4 glorifie his Father, byJo. 6.39. revealing, andJoh. 15 10 keeping his will. Also toLuk. 24.46. suffer, andHos. 13.14 satisfie1 Pet. 2.24 personally, andHe 10.14 perfectly, for the sinnes of men, and havingJo. 14.4.19 finished his worke, to bringJoh. 10.18 him∣selfe, and thoseJoh 6.39.40. given to him (by the Father) untoHeb. 2.10 glory. Quest. What followed upon the making of this Covenant, betweene the Father and Jesus Christ? Answ. Christ beingEsa. 42.1 elected,Joh. 6.27 sealed andJo. 10.36 sanctified, (viz. set apart) to his office of Mediatorship, and thoseJoh. 6.39 given him by the Father, being alsoEph. 1.4 v. 5. so the Greek word  signifies. elected, and2 The. 2.13 sealed to obtaine
adoption, and salvation through Christ. The FatherEph. 1.22 Col. 1.18. gave Christ, to be the head of that select number and body (and the head of all other things for that body) and so filled Christ with hisCol. 1.19 owne fulnesse, that he should let outIoh. 1.16 grace for grace into that body, and so committed them to hisIoh. 17.12 Gen. 43.13.14. care, charge, and custody, (as Jacob did Benjamin to Reuben, Gen. 43.13, 14.) having first given them his2 Tim. 1.9 grace, andEph. 1.3. blessing in Christ Jesus. Q What moved God the Father to make such a Covenant? A. In respect of himselfe, hisEph. 1.5. Rev. 4.11. owne pleasure andRom. 9.23. 2 Cor. 1.20 glory, in re∣spect of menIoh. 3.16, 17, 23. free love, andRom. 11.5. grace. For Gods first and maine end in all his actions, is hisIoh. 11.4 Eph. 1.6.12 owne glory, and next making out hisIer. 31.3. Eph. 2.7. goodnesse unto his crea∣tures. Q. But did not God foresee that those (for whom hee covenanted with Christ) would beleeve and doe good
workes, and was not their foreseen faith and workes, the cause that moved God to make such a Covenant? A. 1. No, but rather God did foresee, that they could not, nor would not of themselves, beleeve, or doe good works. For conside∣ring men in themselves, and with∣out Christ, they wereEph. 2.1.5. 1 Tim. 6.5 dead in their sinnes,Rom. 5.8 Ioh. 15.8. without strength, and having neitherIoh. 6.44 Eph 2.8. will nor power, neither in themselves, nor of themselves, either to beleeve, or toPhil. 2.13 2 Cor. 3.5. doe any good worke: and therefore Gods grace preven∣teth and prepareth us, before wee can bee able, and worketh in us, that we may be able. 2. When the Scriptures speake of predestination, and ordination before time to salvation (which as I shewed before, hath relation to Christ, and that Covenant made with him) they say we are prede∣stinated and ordained toAct. 13.39. 2 Thes. 2.13. be∣leeve, and toEph. 2.10 Rom. 8.29 doe good works, and not for beleeving, and
doing good workes. Q If God covenanted with Christ to give salvation to some, and not to all, did he not then leave the rest in a state of impossibility to be saved, and in a state of certainty to be damned? A. I. God is not accountable to man for his actions, and this is sufficient that the will of God is theRom. 9.15 18.22. supream reason of all his actions, and it should satisfie us that God doth what he will, and wills himselfe, and his owne glory chiefly, so that if mans misery tends to Gods glory, it is mans duty to be silent, and subject there∣unto. 2. Though God by this Cove∣nant doth entaile and assure sal∣vation upon, and unto the seed of Christ, yet it doth not necessarily follow, that the rest are left unavoi∣dably in a state of damnation. It is true that Gods preordination, pre∣signation, and promise (before time) declared Gods speciall fa∣vour to such as he chose, and his
preterition, and passing by the rest, shewed a lesse regard of them, and dis-ingagement of God to them. Obj. But the absolute electing of some, doth argue the absolute reprobating of o∣thers. A. God in the act of election,In no mo∣ment of nature did the pur∣pose of condem∣nation goe before the foresight of sin, saith Dr. Twisse. & in the act of preterition, looked upon men as fallen (and not as innocent and unfallen) and thereby his grace doth more eminently appear in the one, and his justice is more appa∣rently justifiable (as toward men) in the other. Obj. But is not election the cause of salvation, and reprobation the cause of damnation? A. Election and Reprobation, are not (in any sense) the causes of salvation, and damnation, but Christ is the proper and meritori∣ous cause of salvation, and sin the proper, and meritorious cause of damnation. Election and repro∣bation they are but precedent, and precurrent acts, or decrees: and the causes of salvation and Dam∣nation,
they come in between the decrees and the execution thereof. Obj. But the Decree of reprobation, puts a necessity upon men to sinne, for if God hath decreed the punishment he hath decreed the cause also. A. The decree puts no more ne∣cessity upon men to sinne, then the secret intent and purpose of a King to put his just Law in execution, makes a malefactor guilty, and to suffer according to that law, fur∣ther who dares reply against God if he would have it so?Ro. 9.20. Obj. But if a King makes a law so strict that his Subjects cannot keepe it, and then punishes his Subjects for break∣ing it, is not that King more guilty then his Subject? A. But the case is not so, for God when he gave the Law at first to man (viz, Adam) he did not give him such a Law that he could not keep. Q. How doth it appeare that Adam could have observed, and kept that Law which God gave him in his innocent state?
A. I. Because the Scripture testifies of him, that he was madeEcl. 7.29 upright and inGen. 5 1 Gods owne likenesse, (viz. in knowledge, holinesse, and power) and therefore sure he was fit, and able to keep it. 2. The commandement that God gave Adam to obey, it was no hard commandement, to be ob∣served by such a spirituall man. Ob. But Adam was no other then a meer earthly and naturall man,1 Cor. 15.47. for had he been spirituall, he could not have fallen from that state. A. It is true; that Adams body was of the earth, yet Adams soule was immediately from heaven, and therefore spirituall. And why might not Adam (though spiri∣tuall) as well as the Angels (seeing they were alike without promise of upholding them, and no union of spirit between them and God, or Christ, and but mutually good) fall from that state. Q. What death did Adams trans∣gression and disobedience deserve, and
bring upon himselfe and his posterity? A. All that the Scripture calsRo. 5.14 1 Cor. 15.21. death, which is either naturallLu. 1.79 spirituall, orRom. 5.2 Eph. 2.1. Iam. 1.15. Ro. 5.15.18. eternall. Q. How doth it appeare that Adams sin brought eternall death? A. 1. From the words of the Apostle, Rom. 5.16.18. Judgement was by one to condemnation, and judge∣ment came upon all men to condemnation. Now condemnation must bee un∣derstood here, as in other places of Scripture forIoh. 5.24. Rom. 8.1. eternall con∣demnation, also the Greek word  used in thoseRo. 5.16.18. two texts is alwayes in Scripture for eternall condemnation: (and differs from the word  judgement) lastly, here is judge∣ment and condemnation to∣gether, which imports both a temporall and eternall judge∣ment. 2. That condemnation which is put in opposition to eternall life, must needs be eternall condemna∣tion: but this condemnation is
such, Rom. 5.21.Rom. 5.21 for the Apostle saith, That as sinne hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reigne through righteousnesse un∣to eternall life. 3. It must be eternall death, else how, and when came mankinde to be guilty of eternall death; do the weake and wicked posterity of Adam by sinning now (when by reason of their corrupt natures they hardly can doe otherwise) deserve and come under eternall death; and should Adams sinne, which was against knowledge, and a cleare Law, have no other pu∣nishment but a naturall and tem∣porall death. Further, how can death (viz. eternall death, Rom. 6.23.) be the wages of one sinne, and not of ano∣ther?Rom. 6.23 Ob. If Adam had not sinned, hee was to enjoy but outward and temporall mercies, therefore having sinned, his sin could bring him under (no other but tem¦porall and outward judgements.
A. Adam being theLu 3.38. Son of God, and after his owne likenesse, (doubtlesse) did enjoy, and was to enjoy, had he not sinned, the sa∣vour and love of God, and com∣munion with him; which were more then meere temporall and outward mercies. On the contra∣ry; the losse of these (which areEph. 5.6 Mat. 25.41 two of the greatest, and soarest judgements that the damned suffer for ever) must needs be more then temporall, and outward judge∣ments. Q Did Adam by his sinne and diso∣bedience breake the Covenant that was made with Christ before? A. No, for that Covenant was not given unto Adam before his fall, therefore he could not breake that which was not given him to observe. Q. Was that Covenant which was made with Jesus Christ before time, af∣terwards made with men? A. Yes, see Esa. 55.3. Jer. 31.31. and 33.20. Eze. 16.8 & 20.37. Heb. 8.10.
Q. Who made that Covenant with men? A. God theHos. 2.18 Father,Eze. 16.8. Jesus Christ, and theHeb. 10.15, 16. Spirit. Q. When and with whom was that Covenant, (before made with Christ) first made? A. WithGen. 3.15 Adam immediately after his sin, and disobedience. Q. What was the summe of that Co∣venant, as it was then revealed unto Adam? A. The summe of it was con∣cerning Christ, being made flesh, and of what he should doe, and suffer in the flesh. Q. How doth that appeare? A. In these words, The seed of theGen. 3.15 woman shall bruise the Serpents head, &c. The seed of theIer. 31.22 Gal. 4.4. woman, declares that he should bee made flesh; it shall bruise thy head; that im∣ports he should destroy theHeb. 2.14 Mar. 1.24. Di∣vell, and his1 Ioh. 3.8 works, and thou shalt bruise his heele; that denotes, and holds forth the death, and suffe∣rings of Christ.
Q. How is Christ considered with relation to the Covenant of grace? A. As the Author and Admini∣ster, as the Mediator, as joynt par∣ty with beleevers in it, and as the summe and substance of it. Q. How doth it appear that Christ was the Author and Administer of the Covenant? A. 1. He is called the Messenger of the Covenant (or Mal. 3.1. that Co∣venant) and theEsa. 63.9 Angel of Gods presence that represented his Fa∣thers Majesty (who could not, nor cannot be seen inIoh. 1.18. himselfe, nor in hisExo. 33.20, 21. glory, neither1 Ioh. 4.12. e∣ver was) but Christ as his Viceroy, and great Ambassador did man∣age on earth (the whole businesse of the Covenant, and of mens sal∣vation) which was before con∣trived, and concluded upon in heaven. 2 In all or most of the places where there is mention either of making, renuing, or confirming the Covenant of Grace with the
Fathers before the Law, or after∣wards under the Law, you will finde, that it was Jesus Christ that did act, indent, and doe all with men. As for example, to begin with Abraham (the father of the faithfull) in Gen. 12.1, 2, 3. wee reade of the Lords first appear∣ing to Abraham,Gen: 12:1, 2, 3. and his making the promise with him,Gen: 17:3 4, 5. then in the 17 of Gen. the 3, 4, 5, &c. we have a se∣cond appearance of the Lord to A∣braham, and then the Covenant was much inlarged, and confirmed; again, the same Lord appeared un∣to him in the plaines of Mamre, which by several circumstances ap∣peares to be Christ, for he did eate with Abraham. ver. 8. and this was no created Angell, as plainly ap∣peares in vers. 3.13, 17, 20, 26, 33. In like manner hee made the Cove∣nant withGen: 26:2, 3, 4, 5. Isaac,Gen: 28:13.3-2:24.25:29, 30: Iacob,Ex: 3:2, 4, 6, 7.-4:4, 5 Moses also he appeared toJos. 5:13:14. Joshua,Ex: 13:11-14.19. Is∣raelIud: 6:12 13, 14, 16. GideonIud: 13:15 to the end. ManoahGen: 16:7:18:-21.17, 18. Hagar &c. Obj. But this remaines still darke and uncertaine whether it were Jesus
Christ or no. A. Consider but two other pla∣ces, and you shall see evidently that it was Christ, and no other, Jud. 2.1. And the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I (that is the Angell or Christ) made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you un∣to the Land which I sware unto your fa∣thers. So in. Esay 63.9. And thei e. Christ vide Ex. 23 20, 21. Heb: 9:24 Angel of his presence, saved them, and in his love, and in his pitty he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old: hence it appears that this An∣gell could be no other; save Christ, for the Father, and the Spirit are never so called in Scripture, and a created Angell had never that dig∣nity, and worship given him which was given that Angell. Q. But was it Christ that did admini∣ster the Covenant to Adam? A. It is probable, if not apparent, that it was Christ, that did deliver that Promise (or CovenantNote that God did not speake those words in Gen: 3:15: to Adam, but to the Serpent, vide, v: 14. be∣fore Adam) if you consider Gen. 3.8.
where tis said, that Adam & Eve heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the Garden, in the cool of the day. This Lord God, was not God the father (for he neverHeb. 11.27. See Di∣odate on Gen. 3.8 & Bern. on the word Lord. appeared in any bodily shape) therefore sure it was Christ the son and word of God, whose goings forth have been of old fromMic. 5.2. everlasting. Quest. What did Christ doe, as the Mediatour of the Covenant of grace? A. He didThe word  (Mediator) signifies one that interposes himself le∣gally be∣tween par∣ties that are at vari∣ance to re∣concile them, unus qui interve∣nit vel in∣terpouit, ju∣re-jurando, vide Heb. 5 legally interpose and put himselfe1 Tim. 2.5 between God and men, to mediate and inter∣cede for them, and soHeb. 10 9 volunta∣rily became obedient to his fathers will, and by undergoing, bearing, and suffering, theps 88.16. wrath, andGal. 3.13 curse due to men for their sins, he tookIoh. 1.29. away their sinsCol. 1.21. re∣conciled them to God, redeemed them from theGal. 4.5. Law, and de∣livered them from the1 The. 1.10 wrath to come. Q. Was Christ the Mediatour of the Covenant of grace in all ages?
A. Yes sure, for there was but thatGal. 3.28 one true and reall Media∣tor, who is said to be theRev. 1.30 Lamb slaine from the foundation of the world, and to be the sameHeb. 13.8 yester∣day, and to day, and for ever. Ob. But was not Moses the Media∣tor of the Covenant of grace under the Law, and before Christ came in the flesh? A. Grant that Moses was a Me∣diator of the Covenant of grace, (though the Scripture rather sets him forth aGal. 3.19 Heb. 12.21 Mediator of the Law, and Covenant of works) yet he was but aDeut. 5.5 Exo 34.34 Heb. 3.2. typicall Mediator, and during his life, (as the Priests of the Law were) and his media∣tion was onely by way ofNum. 14 19. Exod. 17.11. in∣treaty and prayer, and not by way of merit and purchase. Q. How could Christ bee both the Author and the Mediator of the Covenant of grace? A. As God he was theGen. 17 1, 2. Au∣thor of the Covenant, but as God∣man, or GodIoh. 1.14. Gal 4.4. made man, theHeb. 8.6. 1 Tim. 2.5
Mediator of it, as God considered in himselfe, he wasLu. 15.21 offended, and willing to beEz. 16.63 pacified to∣wards men. But as God in ourHeb. 10.5.9. nature, he was making satisfaction to his owne justice, and in the body of his fleshCol. 1.22 reconciling us to himselfe. By his God-head heIoh. 17.19 sanctified, andHeb. 9.14 sacrificed his man-hood, and by vertue of that sacrifice, beleevers areHeb. 10.10. purged and sanctified from their sins. Q. How is Jesus Christ joynt party with beleevers in the Covenant of grace? A. He is theirHeb 7.22  signifies one that of his own accord promiseth and bin∣deth him∣selfe for another; and is as liable to bide the triall of the law as the princi∣pall him∣selfe, and the word for surety in the He∣brew,  signifies mingled, to shew that the surety is as much in∣gaged as the prin∣cipall himself. surety bound to performe, and to see performed all the duties that God requires, or beleevers promise to performe (or are ingaged to performe) in and with relation to the Covenant. Ob. Though Christ be surety for be∣leevers, yet may not he suffer beleevers to be arrested, and to answer for their owne debt, as its usuall for Sureties to doe. A. Oh no, for when Christ first
engaged, and bound himselfe for those (as I may call them) poore bankrupts and beggerly friends of his, he knew, and considered that the whole burden, would lye upon his back, and that he, and not they should be arrested, for the debt: Therefore he takes the whole mat∣ter upon himselfe, and ownes the debt as if he were the Principall, and not surety; and he is contented that the Action and Suit, should be entred, (and that the full force of the plea should be) against him onely. Hereupon, Christ this1 Pe. 2.22 in∣nocent (yet engaged) and volun∣tary Defendant, isEsa. 53.8 arrested and brought to the Barre of Gods justice, where he is convicted, ad∣judged, andEsa. 53.4 7, 10. arraigned, as the2 Cor. 5 21. sinfullestGal. 3.13 cursed'st, and most guilty (though the sinleast, and blessedst, and most guiltlesse) man that ever lived. And having suffe∣red the utmost rigor of theGal. 4.4. , i.e. he became under the law. Law, and not one ace of justice abated him, nor a farthing of the debt
forgiven, no nor so much as one sin unaccounted, or blotted out, tillDan. 9.24 satisfaction was first given. But after a full account, and per∣fect payment, and satisfaction, this Surety Christ,Ioh. 17.5. pleads for a dismission, and discharge, & so gets a generallHeb. 9.12 acquittance and releas∣ment (under the King of heavens hand and Seale) forPhil 2.8, 9 himselfe, and his poorIs. 52.12. friends. Q. Were all the sins of Beleevers, as well sins of omission, as commission, and sins after beleeving, as well as sins be∣fore beleeving, laia upon Christs score, and accounted for by him? A. Yes, Jesus Christ did beare, and make satisfaction as well for the sins of omission, as the sins of commission (as the Priest didEx. 28.38 beare the iniquity of the holy things) and by offering up himself heCol. 2.13, 14. removed all out of the way that was against men, andHeb. 10.14. per∣fected for ever them that beleeve, so thatRo. 8.33. nothing can bee laid to their charge either of the evill
done, or of the good left undone, eitherAc. 13.36 before or1 Jo. 1.9. & 2.1, 2. Ps. 103.3. since their beleeving. Q How could Christ being but one, make satisfaction for the sins of so many as are saved? A. Though Christ was but one, yet hee was such a one as was grea∣ter, andAs it was said to Da∣vid 2 Sam. 18, 3. thou art worth ten thou∣sand of us. better than all, and therefore able, and sufficient to sa∣tisfie for all, and to redeem all (as well as he made all.) And though the redemption of soules wasps. 49.7, 8 deare, costly, and precious, yet theAct. 8, 33. life and1 Pet. 1.18, 19. blood of such a one as Christ (viz. the Son of God, yeaAct. 20.28. God himselfe) was of such an1 Cor. 6.20 infinite value, and price, that it did surmount and surpasse in dignity, and worth, all the soules in the world, and his sufferings and merits were a suffici∣ent satisfaction, if intended and ap∣plied to that end, for to save so ma∣ny worlds of men, as of men in the world. Q. How doth it appeare that Christ
is the summe, and substance of the Cove∣nant of grace? A. He is (as the Apostle saith)Col. 3.11. i.e. The spring, ful∣nesse, cause and rise of all mans happinesse all in all, and the whole Co∣venant is comprehended in him, therefore is he called theIs. 42.6. & 49.9. Cove∣nant, and all the promises of the Covenant, they are but as so ma∣ny lines in the circumference, that meet as one in the Center, or as the veines of Christ (this Covenant) that carry and conveigh his blood into all the members and parts of his body (the Church.) For doe but follow any promise, and it will (like theMat. 2.1, 2 Starre that did guide the Wisemen of the East) guide, and leade you to Christ, who is the summe of all, and in whom all things areEph. 1.10  or sum∣med up. gathered and doCol. 1.17  and all things in him subsist or stand firme. consist. Q Was it one and the same Covenant of grace, that was in force before the Law, and under the Law, till the comming of Christ in the flesh? A. Yes sure, it wasps. 105.8, 9 Mic: 7.10. one and the same Covenant of grace, which
God made with all men in all ge∣nerations, from Adam to Christ, for the promise made toGen. 3.15 Adam, was renued and established as a Co∣venant withGen. 6.18 Noah, afterwards withGen. 12.3 15.1. Abraham,Ge. 17.18 Isaac,Ps. 105.10 JacobEx. 6.4.6. Moses,2 cro, 21.7 David, and al theirGen. 9.9 17.17 with Gal. 3.16.29 Ro. 9.8 spirituall seed and posterity, the trueGal. 6.16 Israelites of God. Objection, The Covenant that God made with Noah, seemes not to be the Covenant of grace, but a Co∣venant that hee would not destroy the world againe by water, as he had done be∣fore? A. God made and established two Covenants with Noah, theGen: 6:6. one before hee went into the Arke, which was the Covenant of grace, (the Arke it selfe being a true type of Christ, and a seal of that Cove∣nant to him) theGen: 9:19 other a Cove∣nant of outward preservation (as I may call it) which he made with him, but with allGen. 9:9 10. mankind, and with every living creature.Gen: 9:12.6: The summe of this Covenant was
that he (i.e. God) would never de∣stroy the earth with the floud a∣gaine, and for a seale of this Co∣venant, he put a Bow (commonly called the Rainbow) in the clouds, to assure all men that he will per∣forme that Covenant. Ob. But we read little or nothing at all, of such a Covenant of Grace, between the time of Adam and Abraham. A. Suppose we did not read of the Covenant of grace betweene Adam and Abraham (though I have already proved, that the Covenant of grace was made with Noah) yet you have heard that the covenant of grace was in force, & being before, between God the Father and Christ, and between Christ and Adam. And doubtlesse though the Covenant be somewhat concealed, yet it cannot be imagined, that (from the time of Adam til the time of the making of the Covenant with Abraham (which was above208. yeares as Mr. Light∣fot com∣putes. two thousand yeares) theCalled Gods sons Gen. 6.2. It is thought also that the He∣brews, or the poste∣rity of He∣ber did worship the true God once and after∣wards fell to Idolatry compare Gen 11.19 and 32.5. with Josh. 212. godly in those many ages and generations were under
no Covenant of grace. Also its more then probable, that Abel, Enoch, and others (that were righ∣teous, and that didHeb. 11.4, 5. offer sacri∣fices unto God) did apprehend the Covenant of grace, and eye Christ through their sacrifices, and beleeve in him for justification & salvation. Ob. But its very strange, that there should not be clearer footsteps of the Covenant of grace, in those two thousand yeares. A. No, it is not strange, for God spake at sundry times, and inHeb. 1.1. As by voice Deut. 1.6. by visiau, Psal. 89.19 by dreames Num. 12.6 by Angels, 2 King 1.3 by  and Thumins, Num. 27.21. by Prophets, Luk. 1.70. divers manners unto our Fa∣thers, and we have but little recor∣ded thereof in the Scriptures, espe∣cially before the floud. As con∣cerning the sanctifying of the Sabbath, concerning the manner of offering sacrifices, concerning marriages, &c. which things were instituted by God from the begin∣ning, though not written. More∣over, note this, that God dothEze. 16.8 Psal. 50.5 owne none for his people, but those that are inEither virtually or actually Covenant with him.
Q. How many Covenants did God make with Abraham? A. God made butLev. 26 42. luk. 1.71, 72. Act. 3.25. Gen. 12.2. one Co∣venant with Abraham, though heGen. 15.18. & 17 2. renewed it severall times with him. Ob. But did not God make two Co∣venants with Abraham, the one a spi∣rituall, and the other a temporall, the one spoken off in the 12 of Genesis, and the other in the 17. of Genesis. A. No, they are not two Cove∣nants, but one Covenant, contai∣ning two parts, as a Deed, or Co∣venant among men, that may hold forth and promise both a reall and personall estate; forGen. 12.2 with Gen. 17.2. and chap. 12.3. with ch. 17 5. & ch. 17.8. with ch. 12.1. compare both Chapters together, and you shall finde that God promiseth the same things in both. Ob. But are there not two Covenants held forth in the 17. Chapter, the one in the second verse, the other in the 7. verse. A. No, for in the second verse God saith, he will make his Co∣venant, and in the seventh verse,
God saith, he will establish his Covenant, this strongly affirmes that it was but one and the same Covenant; and so doth that text in Psalme the 105.8, 9, 10 convincingly,Psal. 105.8, 9, 10. satisfyingly, and undeniably prove. Ob. Yet it seems that the Israelites were under two Covenants, as appeares by Rom. 9.4. and Eph. 2.12. A. 1. The word Covenant is not alwaies to be understood in a proper and strict sense for the matter of the Covenant, or for the things promised in the Covenant; but sometimes it is taken figuratively, for the seal of the Covenant, and so Circumcision which was but the seale of the Co∣venant, is called the Covenant it selfe, Gen. 17.7. Act. 7.8. 2. By the two Covenants there, may be meant the Covenant of grace and the Covenant of works, or the promise, and the Law, both which were given to the Jewes, and are called by the Apostle, theGal. 4.24 two Covenants; or,
3. As some others understand by the Covenants in those places cited, may be meant the Law of God, and the Tables thereof, cal∣led theDen. 9.11 Tables of the Cove∣nant. Ob. But these Covenants are called the Covenants of promise, and therefore the Law cannot be included therein. A. You heard before, that the Law was a Covenant, and that it doth promise life upon the keeping of it, isLev. 18.5 Rom. 10.5 evident; but more of this afterward. Q. How did God make that Cove∣nant with Abraham, and how was Abraham considered in that Co∣venant? A. 1. God made the Covenant with Abraham, as he was aGen. 17.4 Ro. 4.17 18. pub∣licke person, and the father of two sorts of people, to wit,Rom. 4.11, 12, 16. all be∣leevers, both Jewes and Gentiles, and all hisGen. 21.13. Mat. 3.9. naturall progeny and posterity, called1 Cor. 10 18. Israel after the flesh. 2. The Covenant was made
with Abraham as aGen. 15.2 Rom. 4.3. particular beleever (and so it is with every o∣ther beleever) and Abraham himself did partake of the blessing and be∣nefit of the Covenant, rather as a private beleever, then as a publicke person; yet he had a higher favour, and greater honour shewed him, to be chosen of God to be a publicke Trustee, and father of Orphane be∣leevers; but yet beleevers are not to looke upon the Covenant made with him as Abram (high-father) but as Abraham, or Abra∣hamon a high-father, of a multitude of Nations. Q. What were the promises and things contained in that Covenant, which God made with Abraham? A. They were either spirituall or temporall promises and things, and did belong either to Abraham and his spirituall seed, or to Abraham and his naturall (or carnall) seed. Q. Who are meant by the spirituall seed of Abraham? A.Gal. 3.16 Jesus Christ, and all
those that areGal. 3.29 Christs, (sci. that are in him, and belong to him) which are theRom. 4.11 16. luk. 1.55. faithfull and godly in allPsal. 105 8. luk. 1.48. Generations, andGal. 3.28 Ro. 4.17. Act. 3.25. luk. 19.9. - 13.16. Nations. Q. Why is Jesus Christ called the seed of Abraham? A. Partly because he took upon him theHeb. 2.16 nature of the seed of Abraham; but especially because he came from Abraham, as concerning the flesh, and is therefore called theMat. 1.1. son of Abraham. Q What were those things that God did promise to Abraham, and to his spi∣rituall seed? A. That he would be aGen. 17.7 God unto him, and unto his spirituall seed, and that in him, and in thatGen. 22.18. seed, all the Nations of the earth should beGen. 12.3 blessed. Q. But who doe you meane by that seed in whom all the Nations of the earth should be blessed? A.Ps. 72.17. Eph. 1.3. Gal. 3.14. Jesus Christ, of whom Isaac was a type. Q. Who were the naturall, and
carnall seed of Abraham? A.Gen. 21.13. Ishmael (the son of Hagar the Egyptian, and bond-woman) and his wicked posterityPsa. 83.6 called Ishmaelites, also theJoh. 8.33.37. Act. 7.6. Jews in ge∣nerall, were the naturall seed of Abraham. Ob. But was not Isaac the naturall son of Abraham also? A. Yes, Isaac was a naturall, (though ingendered rather in aGen. 17.17. & 18, 11, 12, 13. miraculous, then in a naturall way) and a spirituall son of Abra∣ham also. Q. What were those temporall pro∣mises which God promised to Abraham, and to his naturall seed in that Cove∣nant? A. That he (i.e. God) wouldGen. 17 2. & 16.10 multiply him and his seed ex∣ceedingly, andGen. 13.17. & 17.8 give unto him, and his seed the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. Q. What difference was there be∣tween the spirituall and carnall seed of Abraham? A. Very great difference, for
theGal. 4.18 one was called the children of promise, theRom. 4.13. other the seed of Abraham through the Law; theGal. 4.30 one the children of the free∣woman, (or heavenly Jerusalem) theGal. 4.41 other the children of the bond-woman, (or earthly Jerusa∣lem) theGal. 3.26 one the children of God, and theJoh. 8.44 other the chil∣dren of the Devill. Q But was not the whole Nation of the Jewes the people of God, and in Co∣venant with him? A. Yes, the whole Nation of the Jewes wasExo. 3.7.10-5.1. called, and ac∣counted the people of God, (be∣cause GodDeu 7.6. and 14.2. chose them above all people of the earth to be his pe∣culiar people, and they professed him, and his worship more then all other people) alsoPsal. 106.45. & 111.9 all of them were in the Covenant, either truely, and really, or out wardly, and professedly. Ob. But were not all the Jewes the true people of God, why else are they so oft in Scripture called holy, and a holy people?
A.Joh. 8.44 47. Rom. 9.6.8. All the Jewes were not the true people of God (sci. his Saints and children) and they were called holy, either from theAs Be∣leevers are called ho∣ly, not be∣cause they are per∣fectly so, but be∣cause ho∣linesse which is the best part of them, gives them that deno∣mination. bet∣ter part of them that were holy in∣deed; or in opposition to the Gen∣tiles, who were countedEz. 21.25. & 44.23 pro∣fane, or else because of GodsEz. 22.8. holy Ordinances that were among them. Q How did God confirme to Abra∣ham the Covenant which he made with him? A. Partly by hisHeb. 6 17 luk. 1.73. oath, and partly by theGen. 17.7 signe of Circum∣cision. Q. Why did God confirme the Co∣venant with his oath? A. To shew thePsal. 89.34, 35. Esa. 54.9, 10. immutable and irreversible certainty of the Covenant; and toEsa. 45.23. Heb. 6.17. extinguish and eject all doubts and unbeliefe, that might arise in beleevers to hinder their joy. Ob. How could God, and did God sweare? A. He could not sweare by any
other, (much lesse a greater) then himselfe; and therefore heGen. 22.16. Amo. 8.7. sware by himselfe. Ob. What was Gods usuall forme in swearing? A. The usuall forme that God used in swearing, was in these words, asEz. 17.19 Zeph. 2.9. I live, andHeb. 6.14. surely: noting that he sware by his very being and faithfulnesse; also some∣times he sware by hisAm. 8.7. Excellen∣cy, and sometimes by hisPs. 89.35 Ho∣linesse. Q. Was Circumcision a seale of the Covenant of grace which God made with Abraham? A. We finde very good reason in Scripture to beleeve so, as in Gen. 17.8. it is called a token,Gen. 17.8. Rom. 4.11 or signe of the Covenant; and in Rom. 4.11. a seale of the righteous∣nesse of faith (i.e. the Covenant of grace that promiseth justification by faith.) Also that Jesus Christ was aRom. 15 8. Minister of the Circumci∣sion, for the truth of God, to con∣firme the promises unto the Fa∣thers,
meaning the truth of God by the Covenant of Truth (or theGal. 3.1. Tit. 1.1 Gospel as Paul calls it, or Gospel Covenant) which God had made with the Fathers, viz. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: Now Christ is said to be a Minister of that Cove∣nant (which is called Circumci∣sion by a figure) and to declare and fulfill that Covenant, whereof Circumcision was a seale. Ob. But the word  a seal, signifies but an exemplary note, and a badge of honour, and circumcision was given to Abraham, onely for that end, and not to confirme the Covenant. A. The word  signifies a Seale, and obsignation, (or such a Seale as doth confirme) and so it is taken in all, or most places, where it is mentioned in the New Testa∣ment as 1 Cor. 9.2. and 2 Cor. 1.22. 2 Tim. 2.19. Rev. 7.2.4. So also is the Hebrew word Chotam, which the Lxx. Interpreters translate often  a seale, and  a signe. Ob. But if it were a signe, and a
Seale, yet it confirmed but Abrahams owne faith. A. The Lord saith in that 17 of Genesis (concerning Circumcision, when he did first institute it) that it should be a signe between him, and them (orGen. 17.11. between me, and you, saith God.) And so the Apo∣stle calls it the signe of Circumci∣sion, aRo. 4.11. Seale of the righteous∣nesse of Faith (not of his faith onely) which clearely holds forth that it was a signe and seale of the Covenant to all those with whom the Covenant was made, and to whom it did belong, as well as un∣to Abraham. Ob. Well grant it to be a sign and seal of the Covenant; yet it was but a sign & seal of temporall things, as the land of Canaan. A. I have shewed before that God made but one Covenant with Abraham (though it had severall parts) and that the land of Canaan, and other temporall things, that were promised, they were but the externall parts of that Covenant.
Now if Circumcision had beene onely a seale of the land of Canaan, then what need it to have conti∣nued so long after they came to enjoy the Land? And if it sealed onely temporall things, then God gave them a more visible security of those temporall things, then he did of spirituall things. Nay, if Circumcision was not a signe and seale of the Covenant of grace, then sure it had no outward signe, or visible seale to it, before the com∣ming of Christ. Ob. Circumcision did binde men to keep the whole Law, Gal. 5.3. and therefore sure it was a seale of a legali Covenant, and not of the Covenant of grace. A. 1. Circumcision was not of Moses, but of the Fathers,Joh. 7.22. saith Christ, and given foure hundred and thirty yeares before the Law, or Covenant of works, therefore it could not be a seale of that Co∣venant, and of another legall Co∣venant (unlesse it bee that made
with Adam) the Scripture speakes not, as I apprehend. 2 The Apostles meaning in those words, Gal. 5.3. (whosoever is circum∣cised is a debtor to the whole Law, or bound to keepe the whole Law) is this, that those that would observe circumcision (which was part of the Ceremoniall Law, and not of the morall) they were tied to ob∣serve the whole Ceremoniall law, and this in effect, was to deny Christ to be come in the flesh. Againe, suppose by the Law here he meant the Moral Law, yet it doth not fol∣low that Circumcision was part of that law,Luther saith that the meaning is this, that whosoever was cir∣cumcised did not per¦forme any part of the law. for what Paul spake here of circumcision, he might have spoken of the whole Levitical Priesthood, & said thus, you Jewes that do observe the Priest-hood of the Law (now the everlasting Priesthood of Christ be∣ing set up, and the other taken a∣way) you doe as good as renounce Christ, and seek to bee justified by the Law, therefore I tell you, that you are bound to keep all the Law,
or else you cannot be justified there∣by. Q. What was the intent of God in gi∣ving Circumcision? A. It was for to assure them that were circumcised, that God was their God inGen. 17 13 Covenant, and that he would performe what he had promised. Also it was to put the circumcised in mind ofVers. 14 per∣forming, and observing the Cove∣nant, and Commandements of God, though not to be justified thereby, yet to certifie that they were a chosen, and elect people, and in Covenant with God. Obj. Now you grant that circumcisi∣on did binde the circumcised to keep the whole Law. A. Yes, it did bind them, to keep the whole law; but not to that end, which the false, and judaizing A∣postle did urge it for. (namely, to be justified thereby) Circumcision did binde the Jewes, before Christ came in the flesh, and dyed, to keep the Law, as Baptisme doth bind be∣lievers
since Christ, to observe the commandements of the Gospel (byRom. 6.4 living in newnesse of life) but neither to justifie them or us, but for to shew our obedience to God. And as now it would be unreaso∣nable, abusive, (and contrary to the first institution) to urge bap∣tisme as necessary to justification and salvation, so it was then, toAct. 15.1.24. urge circumcision, as necessary to justification and salvation. Obj. Circumcision was an intollera∣ble Yoke, and burden to the Jewes and their forefathers, therefore it could not be a seale of the righteousnesse of faith or of the Covenant of grace. A. It is true that circumcision was aAct. 15.10.24. yoke, and burden to the Jewes, and their forefathers, so was also the wholeGal. 5.1. and 4.3. Eph. 2.15. Ceremo∣niall Law, which Paul doth slight, and subvert as much as circumcisi∣on, by calling itCol. 2.20. worldly Ru∣diments, andHeb. 9.10. carnall Ordinan∣ces. Yet it cannot be denied, but that the Ceremonial Law was Go∣spell,
and part of the Covenant of grace (at least an appendix to it during that administration) and wereHeb. 9.9.23.  antitypes or copies. figures,Heb. 10.1-8.5. shaddowes, and significant Ordinances, teach∣ing, and holding out Christ, and his benefits for mens justification, and salvation. Obj. If Circumcision had been a sign or seale of the Covenant of grace, it would still have remained, and not have been taken away. Answ. It did remaine during theHeb. 9.9. legall administration, and untill theHeb. 9.10 time of Reformati∣on, but there was no necessity, that it, or any other Ceremony should survive or out-live, its time appointed (to wit, theCol. 2.14, 15. death or resurrection of Christ.) And seeing Christ did take aRo. 9.29. Eph. 2.13. new people (viz. the Gentiles) into the Cove∣nant, he thought it fittest, to insti∣tute new Ordinances, and to ap∣ply new seales. And thereforeJoh. 1.33 Mat 28.19 2 Cor. 11.25 26. Baptisme and the Lords Supper are both of them by Christs owne
institution, set up (and appointed to be observed by beleevers) instead ofCol. 2.12. Circumcision, and the1 cor. 5.7. Passeover. Obj. If Circumcision be a Ceremo∣nie, then it must signifie somewhat that is substantiall, what was it then that cir∣cumcision did signifie? A. 1. Circumcision did signifie, and was a figure of Christ, for. I Cir∣cumcision didEph. 2.11 distinguish be∣tweene the people of God and o∣thers, so1 Cor. 4.7. Gal. 3.29. doth Christ. 2. A∣gaine, circumcision was tyed to A∣brahamsGen. 17.12 seed (or those bought by him, and joyned to him) to shew that Christ was to be born of hisGal. 3.25, 26. seed, and not of the uncircumcised. 3. In circumcision there wasEx. 4.26. shedding of blood, which signified the shedding of Christs blood. Lastly, By circumcision, the peo∣ple came to beEx. 12.44 accounted clean, and so to have a right to the Passe∣over, even so by Christs blood be∣leevers are made1 Joh 1, 7 Heb. 10.10 with 9.13. clean and have a right toJoh. 6.54. Eph. 1.11, — 2.18. Heb. 10.19. passe from earth to heaven.
2. Circumcision in the flesh, did signifie theDeu. 30.6 Ro. 2.29. circumcision of the heart, which is called theCol. 2.11. circum∣cision of Christ, because it is he that doth circumcise the heart, by cut∣ting off, andEsa. 4.4. Ion. 15.2. purging out, the superfluity and corruption there∣of. Q. What manner of Covenant, was that which God made with Abraham and his seede (called the Covenant of grace) whereof circumcision was a signe and seale? A. It was a free, full, wel-order∣ed, sure peaceable, holy and everlast∣ing Covenant. Q. Why doe you call it a free Cove∣nant? A. First, Because the foundation of it wasIer. 31.3. Cant. 3.10 free-love (and procee∣ded fromMic. 7.20 meer mercy and grace) for ther was nothing either in Abra∣ham himselfe, or in any of Abrahams seed (Christ excepted) that deser∣ved such love, grace, and favour at the hand of God. For when God made this Co∣venant
first with Abraham, he was both anJos. 24.2. Idolater himselfe, and also the son of an Idolater. And why should it be made with Isaacra∣ther then with Ishmael? or what was Jacob better then Esau, or wherein was the people of the Jewes to bee preferred before other people, that he should enter into Covenant with them, God himselfe shewes the reason thereof, that it was be∣cause heRom. 9.13. Deut. 7 7, 8. freely loved them, and because it was his pleasure so to doe. Ob. But Abraham was a Beleever, and circumcised, and so were Isaac, Ja∣cob, and the Israelites, and therefore more worthy, and deserving then others. A. Abraham (as I said before) was an Idolater, and dwelling inAct. 7.1.2 Caldea, a land full ofEzek. 23.14. Idola∣ters, Diviners,Dan. 2.2 and 4.7. South sayers, Sorcerers,Job 1.17 Robbers, and Spoy∣lers, (yea the mostHab. 1.6, 7 vile, hasty, bitter, persecuting'st, and propha∣nest Nation in the world.) Yet God out of such an ungodly gene∣ration,
and race, cho oses, andEsa. 51.2 calls out Abraham, blesses him, and enters into Covenant with him, whilst he was yetRom 4.10. uncir∣cumcised. And was not Jacob, EsauMal. 1.2. his brother, begotten and born of the same father, and mother, and at the same time? And were not the JewesEzek. 16 6, 7, 8. polluted in their blood, naked, bare, filthy, unsa∣voury, and unlovely? when the Lord looked upon them, and en∣tred into Covenant with them. Secondly, It may be called a free Covenant,a  Veethenah ber thi, they are very signi∣ficant, Ethenah from na∣than dare, and berith from ba∣rah eligit. because its given unto those that partake of it, Gen. 17.2. the words I will make my Covenant, are in the Hebrew, I will give my Co∣venant; God saith (as it were) thus to Abraham; Abraham, I have chosen thee, and thy seed (and that onely out of my free love, and not out of any merit, or demerit in thee) and I will enter into a Cove∣nant of grace with thee: yea God to assure the Gentiles, that it was as free unto them, as unto Abraham,
and the beleeving Jewes, he saith twice in oneEsa 42.6-49.8. Prophesie, that he will give Christ for a Covenant, (or Christ the Covenant) unto them. Thirdly, because there is no con∣dition required of men (when God enters into Covenant with them) but what he gives with, and through the Covenant unto them: for were there any previous, prece∣dent condition, required of men (as from men, and not given of God) it could not be free. For if one man did give to another man, but one pound for an estate which is worth a thousand pound, it can∣not be said that this estate is alto∣gether given, for there is some (though an invaluable) confidera∣tion given for, and towards it. In like manner, were man tyed to give to (or bring to) God any thing as a condition, and consideration of the Covenant, it could not be al∣together free, nor properly called a Covenant of grace.
Ob. But is not faith the condition of the Covenant of grace? A. If faith be aIndeed faith is mentioned after the forme, and manner of a conditi∣on, but in truth, it is the gift of God, as well as life eternall. Perkins on Gal. p. 157 condition of the Covenant of grace, yet it is such a condition, as is promised in the Covenant, and freely given by God; and therefore not in man, nor expected from man, till first bestowed on man, and wrought in man, by God himselfe. And therefore God when he enters into Covenant with men, doth not come unto them, and say, men, I am come unto you, and I am wil∣ling to make a Covenant with you, if you doe beleeve, then I will bee your God, and you shall be my people by Covenant: but he speaks absolutely, positively, and with∣out any conditionIer. 31.33, 34. I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will for∣give their iniquity, and remember their sin no more: Marke, here is no con∣dition at all; but every word free, and absolute.
Ob. Nay Sir, There is no doubt to be made of it, but that faith is a condition of the Covenant of grace, for there is no∣thing more ordinary in Scripture (espe∣cially the New Testament) then to make faith or beleeving, a condition of Justi∣fication and Salvation, as Act. 13.39. he that beleeveth is justified from all things: and John 3.36. He that belee∣veth on the Son, hath everlasting life. So that sure, faith is the condition of the Co∣venant of grace, and there is no other condition. A. 1. It is true (and it is not de∣nied, but) that faith is necessary to Salvation, and likewise to Justifi∣cation in a sense (which 1 intend afterwards to treat of) yea I affirm (as the Scriptures prove at large) that no unbeleever shall be saved. But that is not the question, but the question is, whether man must have faith in him, before God en∣ters into Covenant with him; or whether unbeliefe excludes and barres God, from making the Co∣venant with those that he intends to make it with.
2. Whereas you say that faith is the onely condition of the Co∣venant, consider seriously, whether the Gospell doth not requireJoh. 17.3 2 Thes. 1.8 knowledge,Lu. 13.3.5 repentance,Joh. 3.35. Mar. 18.3. conversion,Heb. 12.14. sanctification, &c. to be in those that are saved: If so, then I know no reason but that these may be called conditions of the Covenant, as well as faith. But sure neither these, nor faith, are found in men, when God comes to enter Covenant with them: but they are brought with the Cove∣nant, yea they areEzek. 34 25, 30, 31. Heb 8.11. Ezek. 36.25, 26. particular members and branches of the Cove∣nant, and therefore cannot be be∣fore the Covenant. Ob. But is it not Gods part to pro∣pound, and offer the Covenant unto men, and mens part to receive, and accept of the Covenant, being offered, and ten∣dred unto them by God? A. It is Gods part, not onely to propound, and to offer the Cove∣nant, but it is his part also, (yea hisEz. 20.37 promise) to bring men in∣to
the bonds of the Covenant; and to worke aPsa. 110.3 Phil. 2.13. willingnesse, andEs. 40.29 Joh. 1.12. ability in men, to receive what he offers, and gives, toMat. 12.21. Phil. 1.29. beleeve what he promises, and toRo. 15.18 obey what he commands. Ob. Hereby you free the creature, from doing any thing at all, and you lay the whole worke upon God, and so man by this, may sit still, and doe nothing. A. Although GodEsa. 30.7 saith in another case of men, it is their strength to sit still (for before God puts forth himselfe to worke on, and in men, they can do nothing) yet this doth not exclude men at all from doing. But it shews that at Gods first entring into Cove∣nant with men, they are meer pas∣sives, having no condition at all in them; yet when God hath taken a man into Covenant, with himself, and sowne his owne seed in the field of mans heart, and so sprung up light, life, and faith in the soule, then the soule is to say (as Christ said) My Father worketh hi∣therto,
and I work; or as the Apostle said, We are co-workers together with him: yet herein, we must also know that it is not enough for God to tune the Instrument of the soule, but he must also play thereon him∣selfe (otherwise the Musicke can∣not be melodious) I meane, it is not enough for God to give (as they are tearmed the habits of grace, or to worke grace at first in mens hearts,) but he must also in∣cite, exercise and act, those infused or created habits. And therefore its said to be an act of GodsPhil. 2.13 good pleasure, and an act of hisEph. 1.19-3.20. Col. 1.11. power, to quicken, put forth, in∣crease, and act that grace he hath wrought in his Saints. Ob. I grant that faith is the gift of God (and that man cannot beleeve of himselfe) but then God must give it to men before he enters into Covenant with them, that so they may have it as a hand to take hold upon the Covenant. A. Faith is not given before the Covenant, but in, with, and
through the Covenant. And the Author of faith (whichHeb. 12.2 is Christ) must be present in the soule, either before, or at the first minute, and instant of beleeving, for its impos∣sible that the effect should bee be∣fore the cause (as light before the Sunne, or heat before the fire, or the fruit of the tree before the tree it self. Faith therefore being a beam ray of Christ, the Son of righte∣ousnesse, and aGal. 5.2 fruit of the Spirit of Christ, it cannot possibly be in the soule before Christs spiri∣tuall presence.Christ first layes him∣selfe a foundati∣on, and laies, then (or builds) men upon that foun∣dation, Mat. 18.16 So then its Christ in us, that brings us to Christ out of us, or the Spirit of Christ, leads a sinfull soule to the person, merits, and righteousnesse of Christ. Ob. If the Covenant be altogether free, then hath not Christ purchased a right for men to the Covenant, and so his merits is no ground of the Covenant. A. Though it be altogether free in respect of men, yet (as you heard before) it was founded upon Christ and his merits, yea doubt∣lesse
all theGal. 4.5. Eph. 1.5-2.14. mercies, and lega∣cies of the Covenant, were really purchased by him (yea2 Pet. 1.1 faith it selfe which you call the condition of the Covenant.) And though God the Father was inclinable, and propense to be at peace with, and to be reconciled unto men, yet his Justice put a barre to his Mercy, till it had a promise of satisfaction from Christ (yea till it was satis∣fied by him.) For though there was love in God to men from eternity, (which cannot be said to be pur∣chased by Christ, for this is not properly, and strictly, a legacy of the Covenant, but rather the first, and efficient cause thereof) yet this love lay hid so in the bosome of God, that Christ brought it to light, and gained us the enjoyment and possession of it. Fourthly, this Covenant ap∣peares to be free, by the persons that are taken into it, and by the time, they are taken into it. 1. As for the persons, common∣ly,
they are the1 Cor. 1.27, 28. foolishest,Jam. 1.5. meanest, worst, vilest, and wretch∣edst that God doth choose to en∣ter into Covenant with; witnesse the1 Cor. 6.9 1.1. prophane Corinthians, theAct. 19.27.35. Eph. 2.11. Idolatrous Ephesians, theAct 17.22 superstitious Athenians, theMat. 10.3 Luk. 19.2. Mat. 21 31 32. scandalous and ungodly Publi∣cans; and theJoh. 4.8.39 & 8.3.4.11. Luk. 82. Heb. 11 31. luk. 15 13.30. abominable and filthy harlots, whoremongers, and the like. 2. Then secondly, for the time, God enters into Covenant with them; Is it not even them? when they are highest and vilest in sin; as for example; Paul in theAct. 9.2.3 height, and heat of his persecuti∣on, (when he was evenAct. 26.11 despe∣rately mad, raging, raving, and hastily running to hale and drag the Saints into prison) also the scurrilous scoffing Jewes at thatAct. 2.13 37. instant, were taken into Cove∣nant; the Thiefe (or a praeda vel  latca, he was one that lay hid for the prey. high-way Robber) even at the last houre,l lu. 23.43 when he could not serve nor glo∣rifie God so much as one day or
houre on earth; yea the whorish woman, when but newly taken in the Act of Adultery, wasIoh. 8.4.9, 10, 11. piti∣ed and tendred by Christ. These and many other examples verifie thatEz. 16.8 Scripture, where God saith, when they were in their filthinesse and nakednesse, he sware unto them, and entred into a Covenant with them, and they became his. But to come to the second property of the Cove∣nant. Secondly, It is a full, and com∣pleat Covenant,1 Tim. 6 17. riehly, and plentifully stored with all suitable promises, both for1 Tim. 4.8 this life, and that which is to come; (like thatPsal. 65.9 River of God which is said to be full of water, or thePs. 104.24 earth full of Gods riches) There is in God, and in his CovenantRom. 2.4 riches of goodnesse to pardon, and passe by mens sinfulnesse;Eph. 1.7 riches of grace to cover mens nakednesse, and shamefulnesse; andRom. 9.23; Eph. 3.16. riches of glory to satisfie mens soules for ever. Note this, That a soule can∣not
not want the good thing, but it is in Christ, and the Covenant, nor seeke the good thing either for soule or body, but it is promised in the Covenant. For the Lords promises are altogether asThe number of the pro∣mises (by Mr. Leighs computa∣tion) are about 1540. and there bee many more. large as his commands (and larger then his threatnings) therefore soule, thou canst not be in that conditi∣on, (whether thou beestPs. 84.11 Phil. 4.19. a Saint, or a Sinner,) but there is some∣what in the Covenant, which suits with that condition, and tends to answer, relieve, and redresse thee, be it for soule, body, or both. Thirdly, It is an1 Sam. 23.5. ordered (or well-ordered) Covenant. 1. In respect of the persons with whom it is made, as first and primarily with Christ, then with men, as you heard before. Secondly, In respect of the pro∣mises, and parts of the Covenant; as first,Jer. 32.38 God becomes our God, and then makes us his people, and afterwardsEzek. 16 8, 9. washes, and sancti∣fies us from our sins.
Thirdly, In respect of manife∣station, God first reveals it by his2 Tim. 1.10 Psa. 111.9 outward Ministry, then after∣wards2 Cor. 1.22. Eph. 1.13. reveals, seals, and assures it, to mens soules by his Spirit. Fourthly, In respect of the ends of the Covenant; for first, and chiefly, God aims at his own, and at his Son his glory, and next at the happinesse, and salvation of his people, and in these senses, it may be called an ordered, or well-ordered Covenant. Fourthly, It is a2 Sam. 23.5. sure and firm Covenant (yeaEsa. 55.3 Act. 13.34 all, and every of the mercies thereof are sure,) and therefore called the sure mer∣cies of David, or of the beloved (as the originall signifies) yea as the proverb is, As sure as a Rocke, for its builded and founded upon thatEsa. 26.4. marg. rocke of ages, Jesus Christ. This Covenant of God is like, (yea far more certaine then) the Lawes of the Medes, and Persians, which were unchangeable and unalterable. Marke howPs. 89.34 God
speakes, My Covenant (saith he) will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Obj. This Promise was made unto David, who was a strong beleever, and a man after Gods own beart, but is it so sure to every ordinary beleever, as it was to him? A. Yes sure, marke the words of the Apostle, Rom. 4.16.Ro. 4.16. Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed. As well Gentiles as Jewes, as well the weake, as the strong seed of Abraham, as well the sinful∣est as the holiest of his seed. Obj. Oh but David was a very zea∣lous, religious, and upright man, and not such a great sinner as I am. A. 1. Beleeve this, that thou art as neere, and as deere to God as David was, even as Joseph and Benjamin, the youngest sons were, asGen. 37.3 4.-44.29. greatly (yea more) beloved by Jacob then Reuben the eldest: and thou Gospell beleever, art one of beautifull Rachels children, I mean
the Church of the New Testament:Christ takes the first and cheifest care of his lambs (or those that are weak) Joh. 21.15. This is to be under∣stood of the visible Church. and David was but a sonne of bleer-eyed-Leah the Church of the Jewes and did not ChristMat. 11.11 say, That he that was least in the Kingdome of heaven (or in the Church of the new Testa∣ment) was greater then John the Bap∣tist. 2. If thou art a greater sinner then David, then thou art deerer to Christ then David, for hee paide more for thee, then for him. AsGen. 29 30. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah because he obeyed, suffered, & indu∣red most for her. And as the Prodi∣galls fatherLu. 15.13 23, 24, 30, 32. rejoyced most in his lost and dead son, though hee had spent his own, and his fathers substance with Harlots: even so thou, who art the greatest sinner, and didst cost Christ most, art sure become dearest to him. An excel∣lent example there is for this inJer. 31.20 Jeremy, Is Ephraim my deare son? is he a pleasant child? Or it may be read thus, Ephraim my dear son, he is a plea∣sant child: for since I spake against
him, I do earnestly remember him still, therefore my bowells sound for him, and what followes? I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord, Marke here! how deare, and delightfull affections, are joyned with tender and mercifull compas∣sions, set forth in sweet, working, soule-ravishing, and heart-melting expressions. And all to a people that had committed Idolatry a∣gainst the Lord, yea, and but lit∣tle before God spake these words unto them, they hadHos. 5.13 departed and revolted from the Lord to put confidence in man, yea, they were guilty at this time, and did lye under manyHos. 4.17-5.3.-6.8.-11.12-12.14.-13.12, great fins, as Idolatry, backsliding, unbeleife, luke-warmenesse; and for God to speak at such a time, to such a people, in such a manner, what to call an Idolater his son, a Back-slider his dear sonne, a diffi∣dent distrustfull unbeleever, his pleasant childe; oh! let such a love be admired, such mercy pub∣lickly proclaimed, such expressions
for ever recorded and remembred, such a Covenant embraced, and hugged, and such carriage, and kindnesse constantly thought on, and minded, and ought not such a Lord, and Father, to be dearly daily, and sincerely loved and af∣fected, and to be chearfully, duly, and dutifully obeyed, and honou∣red, and his words and will, sted∣fastly, and firmely beleeved, and observed for ever. Obj. But here we finde Ephraims re∣pentance,v. 18. as well as his sinne, were it so with me I should not doubt of Gods pro∣mise. A. It is very true, after the Lord had so bemoaned, and pittied E∣phraim, and made such gracious promises to him, he did repent; but you do not find Ephraim repenting first,See the chapter throghout. but God (though offended) hee comes and bewailes Ephraims condition, and so by his loving speeches and lovely behaviour, winnes and workes Ephraim,
to acknowledge his sinne, and shame, as Ephraim himselfe con∣fesses; After that I was turned, I re∣pented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: Marke here, Ephraims worke is an after worke, like Peters weeping, after Christ had graciously looked upon him. Ob. Oh but Ephraim, and Peter, had faith before, but I finde my unbe∣liefe soigreat, that I feare it will so pro∣voke God as to make him with-hold from me what he promiseth in his Cove∣nant. A. 1. Doe you thinke that yourRom. 3.3 unbeliefe, can make, or shall make, the faith of God, (i.e. theSo the word  is taken, Mat. 23.23. Tit. 2.10. fidelity, orGal. 1.23-3.2. word of God) of none effect? No sure, GodMal. 3.6 gives this reason why hee doth not breake his Covenant, and utterly destroy and consume men. For I (saith God) change not; there∣fore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed: But, Secondly, I tell you, (and charge
you from God to beleeve it) that though you find your self unbelee∣ving, yet you are not to question the truth, and accomplishment of Gods promises, for they are sure, (and not grounded upon your faith, but upon his owne grace, and his Son his merits) and therefore saith the2 Tim. 3.12. Apostle, though we beleeve not, yet be remaineth faithfull, he cannot deny himself. Thirdly, You may be mistaken in your selfe, and thinke you doe not beleeve when you doe beleeve; and herein you may erre upon one hand, as the carnall man doth on the other; for he thinks he doth beleeve, when he doth not beleeve, and you thinke you doe not be∣leeve, when you do beleeve. As a Cheater would put off his brasse for gold; so an honest man may suspect his owne gold to be brasse; therefore doe not say, I have no faith, because I have feare, for there may be (not onely true, but) great faith where there isLuk. 8.47 48. fear,
andi. e. At Gods pre∣sence, and glory and a mans owne vile∣nesse & de∣bility. Esa. 6.5 Job 40 4. trembling; and it is a sure signe of faith to see your owneMar. 9.24. unbeleef, andLuk. 7.7 unworthi∣nesse. Fourthly, Consider whether you doe not sin against God, and wrong your owne soule, by such unbeleeving words. For if you do beleeve, and say you doe not, then doe you deny the worke of God in you, and lie against the Spirit of God: Againe, suppose you doe not beleeve, yet by your words, you put weapons in the hands of the Devill, to wound, and kill your selfe; for when you accuse your selfe to be an unbeleever, and a Hypocrite; doe you thinke that Satan will not make advantage of your sayings against you? and so la∣bour to confirm you in your unbe∣leef and doubts? Therefore I counsel Saints, to take heed what confessi∣ons they make, & what accusations they charge themselves with, for Satan will seeke no better proofe against a man, to impeach him be∣fore
God, then this, Lord I accuse such a man to be an unbeleever, and a hypocrite, witnesse this owne confession; if he be so, why dost thou suffer him to live; if he be not so, why dost thou suffer him to lie. Consi∣derPsal. 77.8, 9, 10. Asaph (a godly man, and holy Prophet) when he had but pro∣pounded these doubting questions, (though he concluded nothing) Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy cleane gone for ever? doth his promise faile for evermore, &c. he presently sees his sin therein, and saith, This is my infirmity; or as it is in the Lxx.  Now I have be∣gun. Hebrew, this is that my sicknesse (or plague) he looked upon unbeleefe, as the great plague sore of his soule; and till God convince you of unbeleefe, and that it is your sinne to give way to doubting, you will continue to nourish this snake in your bosome, which will sting your souls to death. Ob. But though God makes the Co∣venant
with men at first freely, and though it be sure in its selfe; yet after∣wards there is some condition on mans part, which if it bee not perfor∣med by man, God is dismissed, and discharged, from performing his part; for in a mutuall Covenant among men, when one party neglects to per∣forme the Covenant, or Articles on his part, the other is no longer tyed in that Covenant, to the other party, or to performe the conditions on his part. A. This Objection supposes three things, that are not true; First, that the Covenant of grace is partly free, and partly conditio∣nall; but this hath beene before spoken of, and therefore I say no more, but what theEsa. 26.12 Prophet saith (by altering the tense and person) The Lord doth worke all our workes in (or for) us, as well after beleeving as before belee∣ving. Secondly, This Objection seems to hold forth that a man may have
true faith (objected before as the condition of the Covenant) and afterwards lose it. But its plaine otherwise, that the1 Job. 2.27. Spirit, and1 Jo. 3.9 seed of God (being once in be∣leevers) they remaine, and abide for ever in them; and therefore they cannot lose their faith, (or any other grace) totally: Its true, they may losePs. 51.12 2 Sam. 27.1 with Ps. 3.6 degrees of faith, and recover them againe, and they mayProv. 24.16. fall oft, and be re∣stored, andHos. 14 4 backslide, and be re∣covered. But God hath said,Jer. 32.40 I will write my Lawes in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me. Thirdly, this Objection would make God as man, and Gods Co∣venant like mans Covenant, but neither of both is so, Let God there∣fore be true, but every man a lyar; for when God makes this Covenant of grace once with any, he cannot, doth not, nor will not, breake it with them. For marke how the LordEsa. 54.10 speakes, The mountaines shall depart, and the hills shall be remo∣ved,
but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed. So inJer. 33.20. Je∣remy, If you can breake my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night that there should not be day and night in their season, then may also my Covenant be broken, &c. But grant Gods Covenant to be like mans Covenant, (though to speak with reverence, it differs as much as God and man differ) yet doth not the ApostleGal. 3.15 say, (though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be confirmed,) no man disanulleth it. And if man (who is both fraile and mutable) will keepe his pro∣mise, and covenant, how much more, will God, who isGen. 17.1 Al∣sufficient,Jam. 1.17 without variable∣nesse, andTit. 1.2. cannot lie, keepe his Covenant. Can it be thought, that that just God, whoRo. 1.31 hates Co∣venant-breaking, andEze. 17.15 16, 17, 18. punishes Covenant-breakers, will himselfe breake Covenant; no, no: far be it from us, to entertaine such a sin∣full thought.
Ob. But God threatens the chil∣dren of Israel, that they should know his breach of promise, Num. 14.34. A. That is, they should know what it was to charge him with breach of promise; withall, this was but a conditionall, and tempo∣rall promise; see Judg. 2.1. Ob. But God threatens to deal with men, even as they deal with him, so that if they breake Covenant with him, he may do the like with them, Ezek. 16.59. A. Gods dealing here, was not to breake his Covenant with them; for in the next verse he saith, hee will remember his Covenant, and establish it with them; but his dea∣ling with them was to chastise them, as he saithPs. 89.31 32, 33, 34. else-where, If they breake my Statutes and Commande∣ments, then will I visit their transgressi∣ons with a Rod, and their iniquity with stripes; neverthelesse my loving kindnesse will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulnesse to faile; my Co∣venant I will not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth.
Ob. Yet God saith in Zach. 11.10.11. that he did break his Covenant with them. A. By this Covenant may bee meant outward happinesse that God had promised the Jewes, and that conditionally; or else by this Covenant (as may seem by the 11. verse) may be meant Jesus Christ, which the poore of the flocke (i. e. the elect and saithfull) knew to be the word of God, which was broken for their sins, and this a∣grees with other Scriptures, which call Christ aEsa. 42.6 Covenant, and also speake of theEsa. 53.10 breaking of him as Esa. 53. It pleased the Lord to bruise him, or as the Hebrew is toDacha, that same word which is in Ps. 94.5 breake him in pieces. Ob. Yet for all this, the Covenant of grace may be broken, if not on Gods part, yet on mans part; for it is said plainely, that the Israelites brake the everlasting Covenant, Esa. 24.6. A. By the Covenant, here is meant the2 King. 18.12. Law or ten Com∣mandements which the Israelites
brake, as it is in theHeb. 8.9. Hebrewes, They continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. Ob. But did not the Lord make this Covenant with the people of the Jewes, and yet for their unbeleefe they are cast out, and broken of these sixteene hundred yeares. A. You are to consider the JewesRom. .2 28, 29. Gal. 2.15. with Rev. 2.9. two wayes, either car∣nall, and spirituall, or Jewes one∣ly by name, nature, and profession, or else, Jewes indeed, viz. the faithfull and sincere hearted people of God; or for the elect Jews that are yet to be called. As for the first sort of them; God did never make the Covenant of grace with them, neither were they ever in, or under the saving part and promises thereof. And as for the faithfull, he never brake promise with them; and for the elect Jewes that are yet to be called, God will remem∣ber the Covenant made with their Fathers, and willEsa. 59.20. Ro. 11 27, 28. performe
it unto them their children. Ob. But how could those carnall Jewes, be cast out of the Covenant if they were never in? A. Its usuall in Scripture lan∣guage, to speake of persons (not as indeed they are, but as they seem to be) as in Exod. 32.33. God threatens to blot their names out of the booke of life; whereas indeed they wereRev. 20.15 ne∣ver in the booke of life (unlesse by the booke of life you understand thePs. 69.2 booke of naturall life, or of theDeu. 29.20. life of communion with the people of God, as that Scrip∣ture is to be understood) but they were rather written in theJer. 17.13 Earth, then in Heaven. SoJoh. 15.2 branches are said to be in Christ when they are not really, butv. 6. seemingly so. In this sense those carnall Jewes, and carnall beleevers may be said to bee in Covenant with God, and in no other sense; for were they really, and indeed in Covenant with him, they could never bee cast out, nor the Covenant broken
with them: For the whole word of God is veryPs. 9 3, 5. & 19.7. & 111.7. sure, and all his promises ve∣ry2 Cor. 1.20 certaine, grounded upon the2 Tim. 1.19 unchangeable purpose andHeb. 6.17. counsel of God, so that he, being altogether wise,Joh. 21.17 knowes how to performe; andGen. 17.1 Isa. 43, 13. al-sufficient, is able to performe;1 Thes. 5.24. faithfull, and must performe;ps. 145.8. gracious and merci∣full, and therefore will, (and can∣not chuse but) performe. Nay, since God hath never1 kin. 8.56. Iosh. 21.45. and 23.14. failed nor brok promise, surely he will not do it. Fiftly, It is a peaceable Cove∣nant (or aIs. 54.10. Eze. 37.26 Covenant of peace) for when God enters into this Co∣venant with men, it is a signe hee is atEz. 16 60, 61, 62, 63. peace with them, and pa∣cified towards themEph. 2.13, 14. through Jesus Christ. Also then the LordIs. 57.19. speakes peace to their soules, andIs. 33.17. Rom. 4.17 sets up peace in their conscien∣ces, so that they walke with God in peace (as theMal. 2.6. expression is con∣cerning Levi) and areluk. 1.79. led into the way of peace, and theirPhil 4.7. Rom. 8.6. Isa. 26.3. hearts, and mindes, are kept by
that peace, so that it may bee said, that the children of the Covenant, haveIs. 54.13. great peace withRo. 5.1. God, with theEz 34.25 Hos. 2.18. Iob. 5.23, 24. creatures, inIs. 66.12. Psa. 29.11. life andPs. 37.37 Ier. 34.5. death. Obj. But there bee many that are doubtlesse in Covenant with God, and yet have neither spirituall, nor worldly peace; neither peace within, nor peace without, neither peace living, nor peace dying, so that it may be said of them, as the expression is, that they know not the way of peace, and they hear rather a voice of trembling, and of feare, then of peace. A. 1. It is true, asEccl. 3.8. Solomon saith in another case, that there is a time of war, and a time of peace; and doubtlesse, many a deare and precious soule, that is in Covenant and favour with God, may for a time want-inward peace, and till the Lord himselfePs. 85.8. speakes peace, andIs. 45.7. makes peace, the soul can∣not enjoy it, yet mark how graci∣ously the Lord speaks,Is. 27.5. Let him take hold on my strength, and hee shall make peace with me: and IIs. 57.19. create the fruit
of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is a farre off, and to him that is neare, &c. It may be the fault of many soules, to refuse to receive peace, as thePs. 77.2. Prophet refused to be comfor∣ted, or else to ground it upon their sense, and feeling, and when that is gone their peace is lost: whereas inward and soule-peace comes throughRom: 5.1 & 15.13, beleeving: Seeing then God is the Authour and Giver of peace, Christ the Prince and pro∣miser of peace, the Spirit the work∣er, and sealer of peace, and the Go∣spel the word and ground of peace, and the Ministers, the Heraulds and Messengers of peace, such beleevers as want peace of conscience, should strive to have the peace of God toCol. 3.15 rule in their hearts, and to be∣leeve that God willPs: 29.11 Isa: 26, 12 blesse them with peace, and to take heed if God do speake peace to them that they returne not againe to the folly of unbeleife.Ps: 85.8. 2. For outward peace, or peace with the creatures, God gives that
often to his Saints, according to hisIs: 66.12 Hag: 2.9. promise, and when they want it, yet they have peace inIoh: 16.27 Christ: And God so orders and sanctifies their troubles to them, that they do receive noIs: 11.9. hurt, but much2 Cor: 7: 4 Rom: 5: 3 benefit thereby. Sixtly, It is a holy Covenant, Dan. 11.28, 30. Luke 1.72. Psal. 105.42. Quest. Why is it called a holy Cove∣nant. A. 1. In respect of the Authour of it. The most holy God, who is proclaimed by the Seraphims, i. e. the AngellsIs: 6: 3: Rev: 4: 9. it is in two Greek co∣pies nine times holy thrice together, holy, holy, holy. And this Covenant God didPs: 60: 6. speake in his holinesse, andps: 89: 35. confirme by his holinesse. 2. In respect of those that are ta∣ken into Covenant, who are also aDan: 12: 7 holy people, calledPsa: 50: 5. Saints. Obj. Before, you said that God did take the unholy, and ungodly into Co∣venant, and now you say they are holy, how can that agree? A. When God doth first enter
into Covenant with men, he finds them unholy, but as soone as the Covenant is struck with them, the Lord puts hisIs: 63: 11. holy spirit in them and his holinesse in them, and so they become immediately thepsa: 63: 18 people of his holinesse. O. But doth not God first make men ho∣ly, & then enter into Covenant with them? A. No, But God makes the Co∣venant with men that theylu: 1: 72, 73, 75. might be holy. 3. It is called a holy Covenant, because holinesse isEz: 36: 25 26. Ro: 11: 26, 27. promised in it, and conveyed through it, un∣to men. 4. It is called a holy Covenant, in regard itlev: 10: 3. 2 Cor: 6: 17 requires, andTit: 2: 10, 11. teaches holinesse, and there is all the reason in the world, that those that enter into union, and com∣munion with God, should be ho∣ly in1 cor: 3: 17 heart, and spirit, and in1 Pet: 1: 15. life and conversation. 5. It is called a holy Covenant, because nothing works more upon men, to make them holy, then the
Covenant of grace; for the promi∣ses are of a sanctifying nature, ther∣foresaith the2 Cor. 7.1 Apostle, Having these promises let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse; And inRo. 6.15. another place saith he, What, shall we sinne because we are not under the Law, but under Grace? God forbid;Tit. 3.4.5. Rom. 12.1 Love, Grace, and Mercy, leave the strongest ingage∣ments on Saints to be holy. Lastly, it is anGen. 17.7. Jer. 32.40. Heb. 13 20. Rev. 16 6. It is called Berith Melek, a Covenant of Salt, nam sal à cor∣ruptione conservat. everlasting Covenant, as (before you heard) it was made from everlasting, so it is to everlasting; for GodPs. 105.8 remem∣bers his Covenant for ever, the word he commanded to a thousand generations: Consider he that made it, is theIs. 40.28. everlasting God; the motive that moved him to make it, was hisJer. 31, 3 everlasting love, the righ∣teousnesse upon which it was esta∣blished, is anDan. 9 24 everlasting righ∣teousnesse: yea all the legacies, and blessings thereof, are everlasting; asHeb. 8.12 everlasting pardon,Isa. 54.8. ever∣lasting kindnesse,Ps. 100.5. everlasting
mercy,Isa 35.10 everlasting joy, and2 Thes. 2.16. consolation, and everlastingIoh. 3.36 life, andIsa. 45.17 salvation. Q. Did God remember, and per∣forme the Covenant of grace to beleevers in all ages? A. Yea sure, the Lord was2 Kin. 13 23. gracious unto them, had compas∣sion on them, and respect unto them because of his Covenant; as it isPs. 111.5 See Exod. 6.5. Luk. 1 72. said, he was (or will be) ever mindefull of his Covenant. Ob. But then it was to such as did keep his Covenant, Psal. 103.18. A. Nay, Though they likeHos. 6.7. See the margent. A∣dam had transgressed his Covenant, andEze. 16.59.60. Note v. 61 saith God not by thy Covenant i. e. the Law. Jer. 31.32. See Psal. 8.31. with 34. despised his oath, yet neverthe∣lesse, saith he, I will remember my Co∣venant with thee in the dayes of thy youth; (i. e. when God first took them to be a people, and made a Covenant with Abraham) and I will establish unto thee an everlasting Co∣venant. God is so far from break∣ing his former Covenant with men (when they sin against him)
that he will rather renew it, yea adde, and make a second to con∣firme it. Ob. But God saith (of the Is∣raelites) They continued not in my Co∣venant, therefore I regarded them not, Heb. 8.9. A. By that Covenant, is to be understood the Law, (or Covenant of workes) and by those Israelites the carnall Israelites, that were under that Covenant, and not un∣der the Covenant of grace: and such that are not Gods spirituall people, nor under his speciall Co∣venant, he doth not regard, Heb. 8.6, 7, 8, 9. Ps. 106.43. with v. 46. Ob. Its true, God said to the Israe∣lites, if their uncircumcised hearts were humbled, then he would remember his Covenant with Jacob, &c. Lev. 26.42. A. This was to the Jews in ge∣nerall, and it was but the outward part of the Covenant, concerning the land of Canaan;Lev. 26.43 44. but yet marke the 43. and 44 verses of that Chap∣ter,
They despised his Judgements, and abhorred his Statutes: and yet for all (saith God) I will not cast him away, neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, and to breake my Covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God: But I will for their sakes remember the Cove∣nant of their Ancestors. Here, though they were very farre from perform∣ing the condition of the Cove∣nant, yet God was further from breaking his Covenant; and though there was nothing in them to move God to keep his Covenant, yet hee lookes on theiri. e. Abra∣ham, Isaac, and Jasob. An∣cestors. Q. Did the beleevers under the Law in their distresses and miseries looke up∣on that Covenant? A. Yea sure, they did2 Chron. 16.15. Neh. 9.32 look up∣on it, and it was theirDan. 9.4 Neh. 1.5. strongest fort for to flye unto, and their su∣rest Basis and foundation, to de∣pend upon, and theirIer. 14.21 Psa. 74.20. chiefest argument with God in prayer. Q Was the Covenant of grace that beleevers were under, before the com∣ming
of Christ (in the flesh) and the Covenant of grace, which beleevers are under since (or now in the dayes of the Gospell,) one and the same Covenant? A. Yes sure, it was one and the same Covenant; which 1. will plainely appeare, if you compare the promises thereof as they are set downe in the Old Testament, with the promises thereof as they are set downe in the New; As for ex∣ample, compare Gen. 12.3. with Acts 2.15. and Gal. 3.8. and Lev. 26.12. with Heb. 8.12. and Psal. 32.1. with Rom. 4.6, 7. These with o∣ther instances, shew it was the same Covenant. 2. It must bee the same Cove∣nant, or else they under the Law had beene saved one way, and wee another; but it is not so, for they were saved by the sameDeut. 33.29. Isa. 33.22. Rom. 12.10. Lord as we are saved by, (evenAct. 15.10 11. Jesus Christ) therefore it is said that AbrahamIoh. 8.56 saw Christs day, and re∣joyced, and that theAct. 26.6.7. twelve Tribes served God with hopes to obtaine the pro∣mise.
3. Yea the same Gospell, and righteousnesse was preached untoHeb. 4.2 1 Pet. 4.6. Rom. 3.21 Gal. 3.8. them as is preached unto us: for as I said before, the Ceremo∣niall law was a glasse (though a darke one) wherein Christ was seene; so they had many pureRom. 1.2 Gospell promises which they did see,Heb. 11.13 beleeve, and imbrace, and doubtlesse were heires, andHeb. 11.33 partakers thereof, as well as we. And therefore we read of theTit. 1.4. common faith, andIude v. 3 com∣mon salvation, (so called, not be∣cause it was common to every man and woman in the world) but be∣cause it was the same in all ages, as well before Christ as since. Ob. If it bad beene the same Cove∣nant, the Apostle would not have called them two Covenants as he doth, Heb. 8. A. Note, that the Apostle doth not there call the Covenant of grace before Christ, and the Cove∣nant of grace since, two Covenants; but the Covenant of workes, or the ten Commandements, he calls
the first Covenant, which Cove∣nant,Heb. 8.9. saith the Apostle, the Lord made with your forefathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, which is very plaine to bee no o∣ther then the tenIer. 31.31.32. Commande∣ments; for the Covenant of grace was made with Abraham foure hun∣dred and thirty yeares, before the Israelites were brought out of the land of Egypt, therefore it could not be meant of that Covenant, of necessity therefore the Apostle here by two Covenants, meaneth not two Covenants of grace, but the Covenant of workes, and the Co∣venant of grace, or the Law, and the Gospell. Q. If the Covenant of grace here spoken of, be the same Covenant with that made before the Law; why then doth the Apostle call it a new Covenant? he might rather have called it the old Co∣venant, then the new. A. It is called a new Covenant, not because it was then begun to be made, for it was before of old
time, asEccl. 1.10 Solomon speakes in ano∣ther case; But it is called new: 1. Because it was manifested and renewed, and so is called the new Covenant, as Christ is cal∣led aHe. 10.20 new way, love, a1 Ioh. 2.7 8. new Commandement; the old heart aEz. 36.26 new heart; the Moone aCol. 2.16 new Moone: Christ was the way from everlasting, love a duty from the beginning, the heart had a be∣ing, and the Moone a forme: but they are said to be new, in respect of manifestation, and renovation: even so the Covenant of grace is now since Christ was made flesh, moreRo. 16.15 2 Cor. 3.11 Heb. 9.8. plainly and clearly re∣vealed, and the great, and glorious mysteries that were before held forth in Ceremonies and shadows, are now brought to light. Gods bosome is more opened, his Ca∣binet of Jewells unlocked, his e∣verlasting grace, and mercy, his eternall love and pity, his unspeak∣able goodnesse, and glory, are all brought out to cleare and publicke
view; and his Covenant is now drawne and written in such faire and great Characters, so plainly, and exquisitly, that they that run may read, if they have but the least sparke of spirituall, and heavenly light in them. 2. It is called a new Covenant, be∣causeall old things that did belong unto it, are now done away, as the Priests sacrifices, Altar, washing, and divers Ordinances, which were meere appendices to the Covenant, and to continue no longer then tillEph. 2.15 Christ his death, or at furthest till hisCant. 2.15. & 4.6. comming in the Spirit, cal∣led theHeb. 9.10 time of Reformation. As the heavens and earth are said to beIsa. 65.17 new, when the state of them are but altered, and the Church said to be a1 Cor. 5.7 new lumpe, when unprofitable, and obstructing members are cast out. So the Co∣venant is called new, because of the altering and changing the ad∣ministration thereof, and by lop∣ping off, and casting away those
troublesome, shadowy branches, the Ceremonies, which did e∣clipse and darken the body of the Covenant. 3. It was called a new Cove∣nant, because it was thenBefore Christ came in the flesh, beleevers had a little of the first fruits of the Go∣spell, but the harvest thereof was reser∣ved till af∣ter his comming, Ioh. 4.35, 36. per∣fected, and compleated; and as we call that a new house which is newly finished, though the foun∣dation of it, and a great part of the structure were laid long before, as the last Temple in Jerusalem was begun above forty yeares before it was compleated and finished: so was this Covenant of grace neare foure thousand yeares between the first making of it with Adam,Ioh. 2.20 and the compleating of it by Jesus Christ. Marke the word in Heb. 8.8. Behold the dayes come (saith the Lord) when I will make a new Cove∣nant with the house of Israel, so it is in the English; but it is in the Greek, the same word is translated finished Rom. 9.28 ended, Math. 7.28 luk. 4.13. fulfilled, Mar. 13.4. and I will finish or perfect for the house of Israel, and the house of Judah the new Covenant. This Scripture proves that the Covenant was be∣fore
begun, and in the dayes of the Gospell finished; also there is a∣nother excellent truth in it, That God will finish this Covenant for the house of Israel and Judah, (sci. all the Jewes) at their next Call and Conversion, which I shall speake of afterwards. Lastly, it is called a new Cove∣nant, because it was confirmed in a new manner, even by theDan. 9.2 death of Jesus Christ, and by hisHe. 10 15 Gal. 5.5. Spirit; also by new Ordinan∣ces; to wit,1 Pet. 3.21. Bap∣tisme doth save us i e. seals sal∣vation to us, as Noahs Ark, and his tempo∣rall deli∣verance, were signs of Christ, & eternall salvation. Baptisme; and the1 Cor. 11 24.26. Lords Supper. Q. Is the new Covenant, and the new Testament one and the same? A. Yes they areBerith in Hebrew, & Diathcke in Greck signifies both a Co∣venant, and Testament Testamen∣tum quasi Tesles men∣tis, the witnesse of the mind. one, and the same, (and the Covenant or Te∣stament of Christ is but the will of Christ) onely since the death of Christ it may more fitly and pro∣perly be called a Testament, then a Covenant; being a Testament is the last will of one, and therein men use to bequeath all their Le gacies, and dispose of all that they
have to give. Also in Covenants there bee many Ifs and Conditions; but in a Testament all bequeathed Legacies are absolute. Lastly, What is made before unto men by Covenant, is after∣wards strongly, unchangeably, and unalterably confirmed and assured, by a mans last Will and Testament; Even so, the Covenant of grace was converted, (if I may so terme it) into a Testament by Christ, and all his Legacies, put into this Testament, in which, he freely, and absolutely conveyes all his estate, riches, be∣nefits, blessings, and merits, to be divided, distributed, and dispo∣sed among his poore friends, the children of men, (that beleeve in him.) And that this Testament might bee of force, Christ the Testator dyes, (otherwise the TestamentHeb. 8.16 17. could not bee of force) and the holy Spirit isJoh. 16.13.14. appointed by Christ, as Executor to see this his will performed.
Q. Was there no necessity for Christ to dye, save onely to confirme the Cove∣nant? A. Yes, there were many other ends and reasons of Christ his death. Q. What are they? A. First, ToLu. 24.44 fulfill the Scrip∣tures, viz. the Ceremonies,Mat 26.56 Prophesies, andMat. 5.17 Commande∣ments, or morall Law; and that this was a maine end of Christs death it clearly appeares, by our SavioursMat 26.54 owne words, (when Peter would have defended him with the sword) but how then, saith Christ to him, shall the Scriptures be fullfilled:Lu. 24.44 Ioh. 19.36 again, all things, saith he, must be fullfilled that are written in the Law of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes concerning me. Q. How did Christ by his death full∣fill the Ceremoniall Law? A. The Ceremonial Law, which confisted in types and shadowes, as in slaying and offering of sacrifices, in shedding of blood, when Christ
who was theIch. 1.7. truth here is put in opposition to ceremo∣nies. truth, and substance of them, suffered, they were expired, finished, & executed (in which sense, the word fulfilled isAct. 13.25 Rev. 15.8. taken) yea, the whole bulke, and body of that law with all that belonged thereunto was (as I have hinted before) so ab∣solutly and perfectlyEph. 2.15, the Greeke word  sig∣nifies de∣stroyed. taken away andCol. 2.14 nailed to Christs crosse, that those Ceremonies were afterwards to bee looked upon (in respect of observance) as if they never had been at all, and no more to beCol. 2.20.21, 22. by ordinances is meant the cere∣monies. Heb. 9.1.20. used, then if they had never beene commanded by God. Obj. If they were so done away by the death of Christ, why had they not beene put out of the Bible? A. They are not left in the bi∣ble, that men may retaine and use those Ceremonies, now in Gospel dayes, (as Prelaticall and Demi-Jewish-Priests did and stil do main∣taine, viz. a materiall Temple or Church, therefore Temple or Church-worship, Altars, therefore offe∣rings, and sacrifices; Piests, there∣fore
Tythes and Oblation) but they are left that Jewes and Gentiles may compare the Type, with the Antitype, that they might beleeve. Likewise, to shew the great diffe∣rence, between the administration of the Law, which the Jewes were under, and the administration of the Gospell, which the Gentiles are now under, and that wee Gentiles may praise God for our freedome from such. Obj. If they were done away by the death of Christ, why then did the Apo∣stles after his death use any of them? A. 1. The Apostles did use but very few of them, and that very seldome, and but for a short time, neither then to allow of them, or confirme them, but partly because that the Jewith people, were not as yetAc: 13.45, 46, 47. rejected nor unchurched, and partly, because of their1 cor. 9.20, 21, 22. weak∣nesse, hoping thereby to win them. But wee do not find that the A∣postles did ever do this, among the Gentiles, as I remember, but once,
thatga. 2.12.13 Peter did conforme out of feare, and dissimulation, and then Paul reproves himv. 11. & 14. publickly, and that justly too, for it. 2. The Apostles did bothAct: 15.6, 7, 10, 12, 19, 20. joyntly, andAc: 17: 24 & 7.48. severallyAc: 21.21. teach, andAc: 21.25 write against the observa∣tion of those Ceremonies, making the2 cor: 11: 14. with Gal: 6: 12. & Phil: 3.2 teachers thereof false, and theGal: 5: 2. & 4: 9, 11. observers thereof faith lesse. Obj. Nay, the Apostles were so farre from taking away all the Ceremonies, that at a publicke Assembly, they rather establish some of them,Act: 15.29. as blood, and things strangled, and things offered to Idols, they do prohibite to be eaten, which things were Ceremoniall and prohi∣bited in that Law. A. 1. You are to understand that the Church of Antioch (and some other Churches, to whom the A∣postles wrote and sent their de∣crees) consisted both of Jewes, and Gentiles, and so were guilty of gi∣ving offence each to other, as some by Fornication, others by eating things offered to Idols, things stran∣gled,
and blood. The Apostles for the reconciling of them each to other, and likewise to subdue sinne amongst them, joyn eating of things offered to Idols, things strangled, and blood, being now but things in∣different, with Fornication, which was absolutely evill, that so both parties, without upbraiding each o∣ther, might close in love and eschew sin. Note also that in three Greek copies there is this added at the end of theStaphanus Greek Te∣stament . b. 1 so after the word for∣nication in the 20 verse. 20 verse, that whatsoever ye would not have done to you, do ye not to o∣thers. 2. Those decrees (concerning meate offered to Idols, things strangled, and blood) did not then binde their consciences: For doubtlesse they might have eaten thereof without sin, in case they did not offend o∣thers by eating, much lesse doth it binde Christians now: Therefore be not scrupulous in this, but read theRo: 14: 14 1 Cor: 8: 8. 1 Tim: 4.5. Act: 10: 14, 15. These Scriptures shew that all things edible may be eaten now in Gospell days with∣out sin. Scriptures that are suffici∣ent to resolve you herein. Q. How did Christ fullfill the Pro∣phesies
by his death? A. HeSo the word is taken in Psal. 20.4. 1 Kin. 2.27 made good those Prophesies that foretold his death; as for example, compare Zach. 11.12. with Matth. 27.3. and Esa. 50.6. with Matth. 26.67. and Psal. 69.21. with Matth. 27.34. Esa. 53.12. with 22.37 and Psa. 22.18. and Mat. 27.35. These and severall other paralleld Scriptures, doe plainly shew that Christs sufferings were a true and lively exposition of the Prophets, and that the words of the Prophets, without variation, or contradicti∣on, were true in him. Q But how could it possibly be, that the Jewes, who knew all these Pro∣phesies did not see them fulfilled in Christ? A. Doubtlesse, that2 Thes. 2.10.11. Scrip∣ture was verified in them, Because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, God sent them strong delusions, that they should believe a lye; they partlyMar. 13.15 shut their eyes against the truth, and partlyJoh. 12.40 Esa. 6.8. God blinded their eyes, and har∣dened
their hearts, and partly the2 Cor. 4.4 Devill blinded their mindes, that they could not understand, and beleeve. 2. The Jewes did overlooke Christs state of humiliation, and looked for him to come in power, and great glory, to deliverLuk. 24.21 them out of the hands of their out∣ward enemies, which doubtlesse will bee the manner of his next comming for their conversion and restauration, spoken of, Mark. 13.26, 27. Matth. 24.30. compared with Zach. 13.10. and Rev. 1.7. Ob. But did not the Jewes know him to be the Christ, and did they sinne ignorantly, or knowingly, and mali∣ciously? A. Without question many, or most of them sinned ignorantly, asTim. 1.13 Paul (who was one of them) said, because I sinned ignorantly, I ob∣tained mercy; and as the Apostle1 Cor. 2.8 else where saith, If they had known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; yet it is likely that some
of the Priests, and Pharisees, sin∣nedJoh. 9.41 knowingly,Mat. 12.31. wilfully, andMat. 28.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. maliciously. Q. How did Christ fulfill the Mo∣rall Law, (or ten Commandements) by his death? A. He didSo the word ful∣fil is taken Ps. 145.19 Ro. 13.14 satisfie and per∣forme, for men, what the Law could require, and exact from them, and so became theRo. 10.3 end of the Law, for righteousnesse, or Justi∣fication, to every one that be∣leeveth; and soGal. 3.13 redeemed, and freed them from the curse of the Law, by being made a curse for them; (this I have hin∣ted before, and I handle more at large afterwards in this Treatise.) But I come to the second end of Christs death: Remember the first was to fulfill the Scriptures. Secondly, The second end, or reason of Christs death, was toHeb. 9 16. 1 Joh. 3.5. take away sinnes, for as under the Law, sinnes were not so much asLev. ch. 4 with Heb. 9.22. typically and seemingly pardo∣ned, without shedding of the blood
of those beasts and sacrifices (that did signifie Christ) so it wasHeb. 10.4 impossible that mens sinnes should be done away really and actually, without the shedding of Christs owne preciousHeb. 13.12. blood, and the offering up of his pure and perfectHeb. 10.5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 7.27. & 9.14. body. Q What doe you meane by the blood of Christ? A. I meane not onely, nor chiefly, that naturall, and mate∣riall blood, which came out of Christs body, when it wasJch. 20.25 nai∣led to the Crosse, or when it wasJoh. 19 34. pierced by the Souldiers; but by Christs blood, is meant hisRo. 3.25 and 5 9. Mat. 27.24 death, and whole sufferings. Q Why then is it called the blood of Christ, and not the death and sufferings of Christ? A. 1. Because that the blood is theGen. 9.4 life, or theLev. 17.14 life is in the blood, and when the blood is shed and lost, the life is gone: Even so here, Christs blood, being as it were the fountaine of his naturall life,
and the pouring out of his blood, being a speciall part of his suffe∣rings,Synecdo∣che. it is put here (by a figure) for his whole sufferings. 2. The bloud of Christ is so of∣ten mentioned by the Apostles, (for the whole sufferings of Christ) because that most of those Epistles where there is mention made of Christs bloud, as the Epistle to the Hebrewes, Peters and Johns first E∣pistles, they were written to the Jewes, who were acquainted with the shedding, offering, and sprink∣ling of the bloud of the Sacrifices under the Law, and it is an usuall thing with the Apostles to retaine manyAs San∣ctuary, Ta∣bernacle, Altar, Sa∣crifice. Heb. 8.2. & 13.10.15 Old Testament-words in their writings, which are to bee spiritually, and not literally under∣stood. But the death of Christ, and the sufferings of Christ are also frequently mentioned in the Scrip∣tures as well as his bloud, and in the same sense. Q. What sins, and whose sins did Christ take away by his death?
A. All the sins of all those, whe∣ther Jewes, or Gentiles, thatRo. 3.25 Heb. 2.15. did believe,Act. 13.39. doe believe, orRo. 11.23 shall believe in him. Q. But did not Jesus Christ take away the sins of all, as well the sins of those that doe not believe,Ro. 8.33. as the sins of those that do believe? A. Though I would be cautious and tender, in limitting, restrain∣ing, or stinting the death of Christ, and the efficacy of his merits, or in censuring such as hold and teach universall Redemption, (if they doe it out of a desire, and conscience to exalt Christ, in the riches of his grace) yet to me it appeares that Christ hath not taken away the sins of those that believe not, but dye in unbeliefe; and that by these Reasons: Reas. 1. If Christ hath taken a∣way their sins, then nothing can be laid to their charge; for what can be laid to the charge of any but sin? So that take away the sin, and you acquit the sinner.
Ob. Christ hath taken away the sin of Adam from all, so that his sin is not laid to the charge of any to their condem∣nation. A. 1. If that were so, then all children that dye before they act and commit sin must needs be saved. Also that denies and destroyes E∣lection; But, 2. If that were granted, yet it would not availe you, for you must hold that Christ hath taken a∣way all the actuall sinnes of all men, and not onely that virtuall sin of Adam: else your Objection hath no force in it. Ob. Christ hath taken away the sins of all men which they have committed a∣gainst the first Covenant, and those sins are no more imputed unto them; neither are they damned for those sins, but for their unbeliefe onely. Sometimes you say, that chil∣dren did not sin at all in Adam, and so were never guilty of that sin; then you acknowledge that they were guilty,A plaine contradi∣ction. but that Christ took away
that guilty from all, now you say that Christ tooke away all sins but unbeleif, and that men are damned onely for that sin. A. 1. The Scripture doth no where say, that Christ tooke away some of a mans sins, and not all, or all his sinnes save unbeliefe, or that God pardons some of a mans sins and not all, No, the Scripture speaksTit. 2: 14. Jer: 33: 8, Mic: 7.29. contrary. 2. Men are not damned for Ʋn∣beleefe onely, but forMat 25: 41 uncharita∣blenesse,Ro: 1.32. coverousnesse, malice, hard∣nesse of heart, &c. And God saith, he will give to every manEc. 12.14 2 Cor: 5.10 according to his works, and if unbeliefe be the only cause of condemnation, then consequently, all the Heathens which have not the Gospell are saved. For unbeliefe is a sin a∣gainst the Gospell, for neither the law nor the creatures (Sun, Moon, Starres, &c.) doe teach faith in Christ as in a Mediatour. Nay, if unbelief doth damn men (as indeed it doth, but not only) then it is a
wonder that Christ would not take away that sin with the rest, but suf∣fer so many millions to perish for not dying for the sin, or for want of giving them the grace of faith. Obj. You say the Scripture doth not mention the taking away of some sins and not all, doth not the Apostle say that Christ by meanes of death made redemption for the sinnes that were against the first Te∣stament, Heb. 9.15, A. The text is not sins against the first Testament but under the first Testament, and the meaning of that Scripture seemes to be this, that it was Christ that did make satisfaction for the sinnes of those that lived under the Law, or first Testament, as well as for the sins of those that lived since, which the ApostleRo. 3.25 elsewhere calls sins past, or if otherwise you understand this Scripture thus, that Christ by his death did make satisfaction for the sins of those that did believe, which they committed whilst they were under the Law or first Testament,
but in that text he doth not say, the sins of all those that were under the first Testament. Obj. But Christ saith, all sinne shall be forgiven unto the sonnes of men, and blasphemies,mat. 12.31 wherewith soever they shall blaspheme, but he that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost shall never have forgivenesse, so that here is no sin unpar∣doned but unbeleefe. A. 1. The meaning is not, that al sins committed against the father and against the Son are forgiven unto men, and shal not be imputed unto them, but that those sins are pardonable: but they that blas∣pheme against the holy ghost (espe∣cially against knowledge,Heb. 10.29 and there∣by doe despite unto the spirit of grace) these cannot be pardoned,1 Ioh. 5.16.17. for they sin, as the Apostle speaks, the sin unto death. 2. Blasphemy is not unbelife (though not without unbeliefe) for the word signifies so translated Eph. 4.31. evil spea∣king, and the Jewes blasphemed a∣gainst the holy Ghost, by saying,
that Christ cast out devils by Beelzebub, when he cast them out by the spi∣rit of God, and upon this occasion Christ didMat: 12.24: 31. speake these words. Obj. If that were the meaning, then Paul could not have been saved, for be blasphemed. A. Though Paul blasphemed, yet it was not against the holy Ghost, but against theAct: 26.9. name of Jesus, and this also hee didTim. 1.13 igno∣rantly. Obj. But sure, unbeliefe is the onely cause of damnation, for Christ saith, this is the condemnation, Joh. 3.19. A. It is not denied but that un∣beliefe is a cause of damnation (yea sure a maine cause) but it is not the only cause, and that place you cite doth not speake at all of unbeliefe, but of loving darknesse, and sure ignorance is no lesse2 The: 1.8 sin, neither will have lesse pu∣nishment then unbeliefe, for did menps. 9: 10. know Christ they would believe in him: So much for the first Reason.
2 Reason, If that were true that Christ did take away the sins of all those that dye in unbeliefe, then sure it will be great injustice in God to punish men for the same sins, that he had punished his son for before, to imprison the surety and to exact the utmost of him, and then to imprison the debtour for the same debt, and to keep him in perpetuall durance and torment for the same debt, is a thing un∣heard of among just men, God un∣der the Law did require but an eye, for an eye, and a tooth, for a tooth;Ex: 21.24. And sure under the Gospell he will not be more rigid, as to require the life of his son, and the life of a sin∣ner for the same disobedience. No, no, God saith that Christ shalIs: 53.11 see of the travell of his soul and be satisfied: sure it would not satisfie Christ, to dye for millions, and to injoy scarce thousands; or to purchase all, and to enjoy but the least part. Obj. Though their sins were laid on
Christ, and he punished for them, yet they are not pardoned unlesse men be∣leeve. A. Sure Christ would not un∣dergoe punishment for men, and suffer them to be damned for ever, for want of giving them faith to beleeve it. For a man that will undergoe hanging to save another from hanging, will not deny if the poor prisoner be in the Goale and cannot come out,vide contra Heb: 9.12. & 10.14. to goe in and helpe him out. This is to make Christs redemption but a partiall, and not a perfect redemption. A∣gaine, if Christ damnes men one∣ly for not believing, then he damns them either for what they cannot do, or for what they can doe, if you say they cannot believe, then you reflect on Christ for damning them for what they cannot do: if you say they can believe of them∣selves, then you make Christ a ly∣ar whoJoh: 15.5. saith without him they can doe nothing. Obj. But Christ offers faith to all.
Ans. Suppose hee did so, yet that is not enough, for he must not onely offer faith, but give faith, therefore saith the Apostle, when he speakes of faith, andEph 2: 8. Phil, 1: 29. that not of your selves, but it is the gift of God, here faith is excluded from saving (as it is mans act,) as well as works. 3 Reason, If Christ hath taken away the sinnes of all, then he hath reconciled all to God, for nothing but sin hindred reconciliation, and the Scripture saith, that the2 Cor. 5.19 Ro. 11.15. world (which word is not there to be taken generally for every one in the world) was reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne, as well as their sins taken away by his death. Obj. Yes, Christ hath reconciled all, but what then? A. Then all shall be saved, for the ApostleRo. 5.10. saith, If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, how much more shall we be saved by his life?Col: 1, 20 21. In another place he saith, And you that were some∣times
alienated, and enemies in your mindes by wicked workes, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his flesh through death, but what to do? Mark! to present you holy and unblamcable and unreproveable in his sight. Obj. Oh but the Apostle speakes in these places of beleevers, but in the other, of the world. A. That Epistle to the Corinthians was written to beleevers, as well as the other two, and the emphasis and strength of the thing, doth not lye in the word WORLD, though afterwards I cleare that word also, but in the word reconciled. Consider therefore whether there be more persons reconciled, then saved, and whether salvation bee not as large and as sure as recon∣ciliation, for certainly if God be at peace with men, he cannot damn them. Obj.vide Is: 53.5. Ro. 5.1, 2 Col: 1.20. All things in earth are said to be reconciled to God, but all things in earth are not saved. A. There is difference between
things, and persons; and as all things (that are figuratively said to be reconciled) are not saved, so none of them are damned. The fourth and last Reason, (to omit many others) that Christ hath not taken away the sins of all, are the words of Christ himselfe, his Prophets, and Apostles. As for ex∣ample, Christ saith, This is my blood of the new Testament which is shed for many, if he had intended it for all,mat 26.28 sure he would then have told it to his Disciples plainly, this is shed for allJoh: 17.9. I pray not for the world, sure he would have prayed for those that he shed his blood forJoh: 8.21. ye shall dye in your sinnes, which if he had ta∣ken away, he would not have so said. Joh: 10.11 I lay down my life for the sheepe, and for myand 15.13 friends. So the words of the Prophets,Is: 53.5. The chastizement of our peace was upon him, and by hisver. 11. stripes we are healed, Hee shall justifie man, for he shall beare their iniquities,}ver: 12. he bare the sins of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors, here is plainly held forth, that those for whom Christ was wounded, they are healed, those that he dyed for, they are justified, and those for whom he poured out his soule, he interceded for, and as anotherDan. 9.24 Prophet prophesied of Christ, that hee should finish the transgression and make an end of sins, and make reconci∣liation for iniquity, and bring in everlast∣ing righteousnesse. And to this agree the words of the Apostles,Ro. 4.25. He, viz. Christ, dyed for our sins, and rose againe for our justification,2 cor. 5.21 be was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him. So saith another Apostle,1 Pet. 3.18. Christ hath once suffered, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, Hence it may bee inferred, that those whose sins were imputed to Christ, his righteousnesse was imputed to them; and those for whom hee dyed, he brought them (or recon∣ciled them) to God, and justified them. Now that men may have
Christs righteousnesse imputed to them, and they reconciled to God, and justified, and yet be afterwards damned, the Scriptures doe not prove, but clean contrary, as for ex∣ample,Rom: 4.6. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth righteousnesse, &c.Chap. 5.9 much more being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him, andCha. 8.30 whom he justified them he also glorified, See further, Mat. 1.21. Heb. 9.28. Rev. 5.9. Obj. Though Christ speakes there of shedding his blood for many, yet by many may be meant all. A. It is true, the word many seems to be taken for all in two places of Scripture, viz. Dan. 12.1. Rom. 5.19. and in no more as I finde, yet in our Saviours language, who spake plainest, though in the New Te∣stament we finde him himselfe use the word near 20 times; yet never in that sense, for all. Obj. But in other Scriptures Christ is said to dye for all, as 2 Cor. 5.15. 1 Tim. 2.6. Christ gave himselfe a ran∣some for all.
A. 1. The word all is not to be alwayes taken for every one, but sometimes for many, asPs: 118.10 All nati∣ons compassed me about, All Judea and allMat: 3.5. Mark: 1.5. See more Zach. 8.10 Ioh: 8.2. Act: 2.47. Act: 1.1. the Region round about Jordan, are said to goe out to John and to bee baptized of him. It cannot bee thought that all Nations in the World compassed the Prophet round about, but many Nations, or that every particular man, wo∣man, and childe in Judea were bapti∣zed of John, for it isLuk: 7.30 said expresly that the Pharisees and Lawyers were not baptized of him. 2. The word All is very often taken in Scripture for all kinde; as Paul1 Tim. 2.1 exhorteth, that supplication, prayer and intercession be made for all men, that is, men of all sorts, and degrees, as well Rulers, as others.Act: 7.22 Moses was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, that is, in all kind of wisdomeRo: 14.2. One beleiveth that bee may eate all things, that is, all man∣ner of thingsMat: 4.23. Christ healed all dis∣eases; that is, all manner of diseases,
3 All, is restrained oft in Scrip∣ture to Gods peculiar people,Ioh. 12.32 saith Christ, I will draw all men to me; that is,Ioh: 6.45. Isa: 54.13. all that the father gave him. They shall be all taught of God; not all the world sure, but all Gods people. IAct: 2.7. will poure out my spirit upon all flesh; this cannot be meant of all the wicked. 1 Thes: 2.15 They please not God, and are con∣trary to all men; that is, all good men. And sometimes the word all, is to bee understood of all wicked men, as Christ saithmat: 10.22 ye shall bee hated of all men for my name sake; that is, of all wicked men. Hereby you see how the word All is taken variously; and therefore it is to be limited and determined to persons, or things, according as the text will beare. Obj. But you have answered nothing to the texts before cited. A, Now I come more particu∣larly,
to answer those texts, the Apostle saith, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and that hedyed for all. 1. This place must be meant of all those to whom the Apostle did write this,2 Cor. 5.15, opened, or of all those that Christ rose again for; because the Apostle joyns Christs death and his resurrection together, but unto him which dyed for them and rose again. Also in several otherplaces, as Ro. 8.34. It is Christ that dyed, yearather that is risen again, so Ro. 4.25. He was delivered for our offences, and rose again for our justi∣fication. 2. The Apostles scope here, is not to declare for whom Christ dyed, but that those for whom he di'd should live to him, as Paul writesTit. 2.11. elsewhere, The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, teaching them to deny ungodlines, &c here the Apostles end is, not to shew that the grace of God hath appea∣red to every man in the world, but that those to whom this grace had appeared, it appeared for this end,
And this, with what hath been declared before concerning the word all, may serve to answer the other text in 1 Tim. 2.6. He gave him∣selfe a ransome for all, that is clearly to be understood,1 Tim. 2.6. opened. for all sorts of men, as the first and second verses declare: or all that are ransomed are ransomed by Christ, as it is said, All may prophesis one by one, here the word all, is not meant of every member in the Church,1 cor. 14.31 but of all those that have the spirit of pro∣phesie; in like manner here, Christ was made a ransome for all, that is, for all those for whom Christ intend∣ed to give his life. Obj. But as in Adam all dye, so in Christ shall all be made alive, 1 Cor. 15.22. A. That is, all shall be raised from the dead at the generall resurrecti∣on as the 21 ver. plainly shewes,1 cor. 15.22 opened. for as by man came death, so by man also came the resurrection of the dead, and the maine scope of the Chapter is con∣cerning the generall resurrection,
and not concerning Christs death; further note, that this Scripture is very impertinently urged for uni∣versall redemption, for it tends to universall salvation, rather then u∣niversall redemption. Obj. But the Apostle saith, Christ tasted death for every man, Heb. 2.9. A, The true meaning of that Scripture seemes to be this, that Christ by the grace of God (or power and goodnesse of God up holding him) tasted death a∣bove any other man, that is, his sufferings were greater then any o∣ther mans sufferings, and so the Greek may be is taken for any, as wel as for all, Act: 10.14. Ro. 3.20. 1 Cor: 1.29. and  signifies above, as well as for 1 Cor: 4.6. Luk: 16.11 and that with a ge∣nitive case (1 Cor: 15 29.) as it is in this text translated, either above any man, or2 cor: 11.23. Gal. 1.14. more then any man: and our Saviours words, to John and James, import so much, for saith he, can you drinke of the cup that I drinke of? or be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with? Importing that it was impossible for them, or any others, to bear such sufferings as hee was to beare. 2. Every man is to be taken here
as in other Scriptures, either for many, or for those that are intend∣ed (as I said before) in the text; for instance,Cant. 3.8. Every man had his sword on his thigh.mic. 4.4 Every man shall sit under his Vine. Then1 Cor. 4.5. every man shall have praise of God. Every man in the world had not a sword to weare, nor a Vine to fit under, nei∣ther, shall every man have praise of God. These, withSee Ez. 33.10. Zac: 3.10. Ioh: 1.9 Rom. 3.4. 1 Cor. 7.2.20, 24. many moresuch Scriptures, declare that every man, is not taken for every one in the world, indefinitely, & particularly. 3. Let it be granted, that Christ tasted death for every man, and that all men have some benefit by the death of Christ, as I believe they have their naturall lives, the enjoyment of the creatures, and the like, which they could not have had without Christ (Adam having lost all by his sin) yet it doth not follow, that if Christ tasted death for every man, that therefore hee suffered the wrath of God for eve∣ry man, and the punishment due to
all for their sinnes. Christ might tast death for all in generall, but drinke the cup of sufferings to the bottome, only for his chosen seed in particular, as it is saidmat 27.34 he tasted the vineger mingled with gall, but bee would not drinke of it (and may there not some mystery be held out there∣by?) So someHeb. 6.5. are said to taste of the heavenly gift, and yet such were without Christ. But Fourthly, and lastly, there is e∣nough in the Chapter it self to clear the text, and to shew both the end and extent of Christs death, viz. to make reconciliation for, and to sanctifie and save those; whom he cals his brethren and children, ver. 11, 12, 13. Obj. You said before that Christ gave himselfe for his sheep, and for his friends, true; But not only for them; for be said that bee would give his flesh for the life of the world, Joh. 6.51. A. 1. By world, in that text, can∣not be meant all the world, those that are damned, as well as those
that are saved: for then either all the world should be saved, or else Christ missed and failed to obtaine the end of his death; for he said, he would give his flesh for the life of the world; it is not probable that Christ did intend to give it for the world, and yet that the world should never have it, or partake of it, as one of the Univer∣salifts saith; his words are these:Tho. More in his book Christ redeemed the world of mankinde, satisfied Gods justice, obtained a way of salvation for every man, but never intended that the outward act, should put every man in possession of par∣don, or state of Justification or Salvation. This is very strange, that Christ should doe that for men which he did never intend they should be the better for; will a man pay anothers debt for him, and yet never intend that it should be imputed to the debtor, sure the debtor is no way ingaged to such a pay master.
2. By the world in that text, and in severall other places, is meant either the Gentiles in di∣stinction, and opposition to the Jewes (as clearly appeares if you) compare, Matth. 28.19. with Mark. 16.15. In Matthew it is, Goe and preach the Gospell to all Nations. But in Marke it is, Goe ye into all the world; so Rom. 11.15. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world; the Apostle meanes by the word them, the Jewes, and by the word world, the Gentiles, as is most plaine in the 11. and 12. ver∣ses; Through their fall (saith he) sal∣vation is come to the Gentiles; againe, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; so that there is nothing clearer, then that by the world he meanes the Gentiles in distinction and opposition to the Jewes. Also this is to bee obser∣ved, that the Jewes under the Law, were theEx. 12.19 Deut 23.2 onely Church, and the Gentiles, or other Nations were
counted the world, orLev. 26.33. Psal. 79.1. Hea∣thens, even as now in the dayes of the Gospel, beleevers are accoun∣ted theAct. 2.47 1 Cor. 14.23. Church, and unbelee∣vers theIoh. 14 17.22. and 17.9. 1 Cor. 11.10.12. world. 3. By the world, may be meant the Elect and chosen of God, a∣mong the Jewes and Gentiles, both those that are actuall and reall beleevers, or those whom God doth intend to bring to be∣leeve, and these are called the world, partly because by nature they do partake of the corruptions of the world, and partly because they are taken out of Jewes and Gentiles; but especially because they are the better part of the world, as the Apostles are called theMat. 5.14 light of the world. Ob. But where are the Elect called the world in Scripture? A. In severall places, as 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himselfe, not imputing to them their trespasses. These cannot be reprobates, for he saith, their sins
are not imputed to them: So Ro. 4. 13. for the promise that he should bee heire of the world; by the world is here meant theRo. 4.16 faithfull, who are theGal. 3.29 Luk. 13.16 children of Abraham; so Joh. 3.17. God sent not his Son into the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be saved: they that Christ intended to save, or really saves, cannot be Repro∣bates. Also in Joh. 6.33. For the bread of God is that which commeth downe from beaven, and giveth life unto the world: Sure Christ doth not give life to all. Again, Christ promi∣seth, that his Spirit should convince the world of sin. Sure this must needs be aThis is the judge∣ment of most (or all) godly Interpre∣ters, see Ioh 17.21. which ex∣pounds it, that the world may beleeve, i.e. those of the world that are appointed to beleeve. saving conviction, and they must needs be the Elect, and not Reprobates that are convinced, for they are convinced of unbeleefe, of their owne and Christs Righte∣ousnesse (which I think no Repro∣bate is convinced of.) So also the ApostleHeb. 2.5. saith, That God hath not put in subjection to the Angels the world to come, whereof we speake; (marke
that) meaning by the world to come, theOr the heirs of salvation, Chap. 1.14 Church of the New Testa∣ment, which hath appointed the An∣gels to be Ministers unto, and not to be Rulers over. I might instance in other places, where the word world is taken for the Elect; as Psal. 22.27. All the ends of the world shall remember, and turne unto the Lord; so the Apostle saith, He was beleeved on in the world (or as the Greeke will beare itTim. 3.16  See the pre∣position  translated by Mat. 5.34, 35. by the world.) So Joh. 1.29. The Lanb of God which taketh away the sins of the world; this must be of the Elect and Beleevers: for how doth he take away the sins of Reprobates, when they are damned for them. Ob. But is it not said, God loved the world, . A. Yes, God is said to love the world, and that shewes that by the world is not meant all the world, for other Scriptures say that GodPs. 5.5. & 11.5. hateth the wicked (or reprobate wicked) and that GodMal. 1.3 Ro. 9.13. hated Esau. God is not capable of lo∣ving
and hating the same person, for that would argue both weak∣nesse and change, which far be it from us to think that either should be in God. Ob. But doth God hate any of his creatures? A. God doth not hate them as they are his creatures (no not the Devils themselves;) for their being, (but not their sin,) is from him: but as now by their fall, and dege∣nerated condition, they have en∣mity in their natures against him, it is just for him to hate them also. Ob. But doth not God hate the Elect also before (and untill) they be∣leeve. A. Oh no; he loved them with anJer. 31.3.2. Tim. 1.9 everlasting love, and this love of his, was theEph. 1.4. Ro. 9.11, 12, 13. cause of their election. Ob. Doubtlesse Christ hath taken away the sins of all; for be is said to be the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, 1 Joh. 2.2.
A. 1. The whole world, is oft∣times in Scripture, taken either for a great part and number of the world, or for the nations of the world (the Gentiles) as the Apo∣stleRom. 1.8. saith, The faith of the Romans was spoken of throughout the whole world. SoRev. 13.3 all the world wondered after the Beast.Mat. 24.14 This Gospell of the Kingdome (saith Christ) shall be preached in all the world. So the Jewes said, the whole world is gone after him. And the Evangelist saith,Luk. 2.1. All the world came to be taxed. The Apostle John also saith,1 Joh. 5.19 The whole world lyeth in wickednesse, and theRev. 12.9 devill deceiveth the whole world. The whole world, in these and such places, cannot be under∣stood of all, and every one in the world. But, Secondly, That text may be ex∣pounded by another, whichRo. 3.25. saith, That propitiation is through faith in his (i.e. in Christs) blood. And according to these ObjectorsVid. A book cal∣led, The fountaine of Free∣grace, p. 4. own opini∣ons, their sins are not done away,
nor they pardoned, or justified till they doe believe, and yet they say all the sinnes of all the world (yea the sinne of unbeliefe) are washed away in the bloud of Christ. This is a Riddle and Paradox, how they are done away, and yet imputed to men, how unbeleefe is washed a∣way, and yet men are damned for it. Sure they must either be done awayHeb. 10.12 perfectly, and for ever, or not at all: And if they be once pardo∣ned, they are so far from being im∣puted againe to men, that the LordHeb. 8.12 saith, He will not remember them any more. Ob. But some are said to be purged from their old sins (which shews that their sinnes were done away) and yet they were blinde still. A. Purging must here be taken one of these three wayes, as its ta∣ken in Scripture: 1. For Justification and forgive∣nesse of sins, as Heb. 1.3. and 10.2. Psal. 79.9. and 51.7. Or, 2. For true and reall Sanctifi∣cation,
as Job. 15.3. Esa. 1.25. Heb. 9.25. Tit. 2.14. Or, 3. For an outward and seem∣ing sanctification, as Ezek. 24.13. Lev. 12.7. Or as the ApostleHeb. 9.13 speaks, a purifying of the flesh. If you take purging in either of the two former senses, then you must either conclude, that those who are truly and really justified and sanctified may be blinde (i.e. mise∣rable) againe,Ro. .30. Act. 20.32 contrary to the Scriptures, or else that these were not quite blinde, or without the knowledge of Christ altogether; but that they were Christians who could not see afareff, as the Apostles ex∣pression is, and so this text is under∣stood by some that are most know∣ing and spirituall. But this pur∣ging here may rather be under∣stood of an outward and seeming sanctification, and holinesse, which the Apostle seemes to relate to, in the2 Pet. 2.2 20. next Chapter. If (saith he) after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, &c. they are againe intangled
therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them then the begining. These men had indeed a sanctification in shew, and they seemed to be made holy by the bloud of Jesus, and through the knowledge of him to escape the pollutions of the world, but yet they were still blinde and unholy, as theLuk. 8.13.15. stony ground is said to beleeve, yet it was never good ground. So Judas seemed to be a true Christian, and beleever, butIoh. 6.64 never was so really, and in∣deed. Ob. But the false Teachers who brought in damnable heresies, are said to deny the Lord that bought them; How could be have bought them, unlesse he bad dyed for them? A. 1. This word them, may have reserence to the people, as well as to the false Teachers. Marke the text, &  de∣clare a di∣stinction of persons. There were false Prophets also a∣mong the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them (viz.
the people) and bring upon them selves (viz. the false Teachers) swist destruction. But Secondly, If it be understood of the false Teachers themselves, then the meaning may be this, that they seemed, in regard of outward profession, to be such as Christ had bought. And the Scriptures speak oft of things not (onely) as they are; but as they seem to be.Heb. 15.2. As Christ saith, Every branch in mee that beareth not fruit, be taketh away, &c these could not bee reall and true branches in Christ, which did not beare fruit, for Christ saith imme∣diately afterwardsver. 5. he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit! so then these, were but seeming branches of Christ, for he further saith, If any man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, he casteth away none but such as did not abide in him, as our Saviour elsewhere saith,Mat 15.13 every plant which his heavenly Father hath not planted should be rooted up. So many are said
to beIoh: 6.66 Christs Disciples, and yet to leave him, and to follow him no more, and many are said, toLuk. 8.13 beleeve and yet to fall away; had these been true Disciples, and Be∣leevers, they would never have left Christ, and falne away: but these, were like those of whom the Apo∣stle John1 Ioh. 2.19 writes, they went out from among us, saith he, because they were not of us, for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. There be many more instances of this nature. As Christ saith, from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath, so it is inMar: 4 25 Marke; butLuk: 8.18 Luke relating the same story, saith, that whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away that, which hee seemeth to have,. or, (as the Greeke is) that which heSo the verb  is transta∣ted Lu: 10.36. & 12.40 51. & 13.1. Jo. 5.39, 45 thinketh to have. So Ahaz is2 Chro. 28 23. said to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus who smote him, these were no Gods but Idols, but hee thought them to be gods indeed: In like manner these false Teachers
might be (as Paul speakes) some∣what in shew and in appearance,As we see by woefull experience in our days that many who seem to be true Christians do now deny Christboth in word, and pra∣ctice. and like the true Teachers of Christ, and so esteemed of by the people, as if Christ had dyed for them, yea, doubtlesse they might judge so of themselves. Thirdly, the Apostle Jude (who wrote to the same people)Jude. v. 4. saith, that these false Teachers denied the one∣ly Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. And that word  Lord, in Peter is usually given unto theLu: 2.28, 29. Act. 4.24. with 27 father and signifies rather a1 Tim. 6.1 2 & 2.2.21.1. Pet: 2 18. Master and Ruler, then a Lord and Saviour. And so the meaning may be this, that these false Teachers did deny God, and Christ. who had freed them from outward cor∣ruption (for the word bought is ta∣ken forRev: 14.3 outward redemption) and in that fense;Jude 4, 5. the Apostle Jude seemes to carry it, for he paralels this with the deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt. Obj. If Christ hath not dyed for the sinnes of all, how can the Gospell be prea∣ched,
and tendred to all? A. The true and right way of preaching, and tendering the Gos∣pell unto all, is not by telling e∣very man, that Christ dyed for him. But the preaching of the Go∣spell consists, 1. In proclaiming, publishing, and maintaining, those things (which are now set downe in the history of theCalled the kingdom of God, Iu 4.43. & 9 21 Mat: 10.7 New Testament)Act: 5.41 8.2.12. & 28.23,  Ti. 3.16. concerning Christ. As that he is theIoh: 3.35. Son of God, the true Christ, and theAct: 2.20, 36. & 17.3 promised Messias. Also concerning hisLuk: 1.35. flu: 2.10, 11 conception,Lu: 2.10, 11 birth,Mat: 3.11 baptisme,Act: 2.22 23, 24 & 10 38, 39, 40. miracles, his workes, and his walking: his death, re∣turrection, ascention, and comming to judgement. And how all the pro∣mises made unto the Fathers con∣cerning him, areAct 13.32, 33. Luk: 1 54, 55. fulfilled unto us their children. 2. To preach the Gospell is to set forth the greatnesse, and free∣nesse of theIoh: 3.16 Rom: 5.8. Fathers love, and Christs love, in all that was done, and suffered by Christ, for the ju∣stification
and salvation of sin∣ners: 3. To preach the Gospell is toMar. 16.15 Col: 1.23. tell all persons (indefinitely, and generally, without limitation, or exception,) this glad tydings, and good newes, that though they have broken the Law in every point, and brought themselves, under the curies thereof, so that they come short of the glory of God, and cannot thereby possibly be saved; yet if they come to ChristThis is called a preaching of repen∣tance and forgivenes of sinnes throught Christs name, Lu: 24.47. Ac: 13.38. and beleeve in him, and repent, and turne from their sins, they shall receive forgivenesse offins, and ever∣lasting life. 4. To preach the Gospell, is to declare the free, and gracious pro∣mises of Gods Covenant, made to fin∣ners, as sinners, viz. that he, i.e. God, willHeb. 8.10 put his Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, that hee will be to them a God, and they shall be to him a people. That heEz: 36.26 27. will give them a new heart, and take the stony heart cut of their flesh, &c. And that he will
put his spirit within them, and cause them to walke in his Statutes. This was the practise ofIoh: 6.45 Mat: 12.21 Jesus Christ himselfe, and of hisAct: 2 17 & 13.47. Apostles in their preaching, to incourage sinners to beleeve and turne. 5. To preach the Gospell, is to open, and apply all those great, and gloriousEph: 3:8. Col: 2.2 mysteries, con∣cerning the Father, Sonne, and Spirit: and concerning the Saints happy estate, in grace, and glory. As also how they are to live by faith,To teach duties, to God and men, in a gospel way is to preach the Gospel Re: 15.19 with Ac. 20 27. through love, in obedience, and conformity to their Father, and Lord, and to perform all duties towards their brethren, and those without (or the world) accord∣ing to what is written in the Scrip∣tures. Obj. But men will have cause to doubt, and to be discouraged from belee∣ving, unlesse that they hear that Christ dyed for every man. A. It is sufficient to tell men in generall tearms, that Christ dyed for sinners, for the ungodly, for
enemies, for the rebellious, for the world; yea, for all and every man that will beleeve in him. Here is a door wide, and open enough,Those that preach that Christ died for every man, yet preach that none shall be sa∣ved but those that beleeve; and those that doe not speake so particu∣larly, but generally, that Christ dyed for simiers, yet preach that all that doe beleeve shall be sa∣ved, which in effect is one and the same. and a way, free and large enough for any man (be he what he will) to come in. For the word Sinner compre∣hends all kinde of Sinners what so∣ever: And may not a Sinner from hence argue thus; If Christ hath dyed for Sinners, for the ungod∣ly, &c. then why not for me, for I am a sinner, and one that's un∣godly. Ob. Oh but the Sinner may say, true Sir, Christ dyed for sinners, and for the ungodly, but if he dyed not for all sin∣ners, I may be one of those for whom he did not dye. A. 1. A Sinner should not object so, for he doth but debarre himselfe thereby from partaking of the grace of Christ tendred to him, and such an objection is to be looked on as a temptation, or arising from the soules grand sinne, and Christs great enemy unbeliefe. But
put the case one should so object, yet this is a sufficient ground to resolve him, that if he doth be∣leeve, he shall have a part in the death of Christ, and be saved. Pri∣soners adjudged to die, and having pardons tendred to them, doe not question whether those pardons were intended and granted for all in their condition; but they upon the first sight and hearing thereof, strive and grapple hard to catch hold upon such a pardon: even so sinners, when pardon of sinnes and salvation is tendred and preached to them, they should, like Jacob, strive to have the blessing; or like the women that strove for the childe, they should cry, It is my pardon, My pardon, and not, Is it for me, Is it for me? 2. The same objection might have been made by the Jewes, when Christ said, ThatMat. 22.14. many were called, but few chosen, and thatMat. 7.13 14. many did goe in at the wide gate, and few at the narrow; also thatLuk. 13.24. many
should seeke to enter in, and should not be able; that beJoh. 17.9 prayed nor for the world, &c. The like objection may be also now made against many ex∣pressions in the Apostles writings; As that, someEph. 1.4. Were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, and othersIud. v. 4. ordained of old to condemna∣tion. Q. Whether were the Heires of sal∣vation (or the Elect) alwayes under the Covenant of grace? A. As elect, and considered in Christ, they were doubtlesse before the foundation of the world, and ever since, under the Covenant of grace. For the Covenant which God made with Christ before the foundation of the world, was a Covenant of grace, and this Cove∣nant (as I shewed before) was made with him, as he was a Mediatour, for, and in the behalfe of the heires of salvation. And therefore doth the Apostle say, ThatTit. 1.2. God promi∣sed eternall life, and2 Tim. 1.9 gave his grace unto such before the world began.}
Obj. But did not they, as well as o∣thers, sin in Adam, and therby & ring them∣selves under the Covenant of workes? A. Its true, they didRo: 5:12, 16, 18. sin in Adam, and so did deserve to come under the Covenant of works, and the curses thereof, as well as the damned themselves. But yet Gods former Covenant, and act of grace, (made with Christ concerning them) stayed, and stopped, legall proceedings, and execution against them. And instead of bringing them to a judiciall tryall, accord∣ing to their deserts: their sin was transferred, and put upon the ac∣count of Christ. As when the children of a King, breake the Sta∣tute of their King and Father, de∣serve to be punished, as well as a∣ny other Subjects, yet their faults are remitted, and they pardoned, upon that ground of relation, betweene him and them, so that they never come under actu∣ally the penalty and execution of that Statute-law which they break.
Obj. But the Elect by nature, and before they doe beleeve are the children of wrath, and not the children of God, Eph. 2.2. A. 1. It is true, that the Elect are the children of wrath by nature as well as others, till they doe be∣leeve. But withall, it is as true, that they are the children of God by grace. As Christ was a son of Gods love, and an object of his delight inIn the confidera∣tion of a Sonne. Mat: 17:5: Joh: 3:35: one consideration, so hee was both an object and a subject (if I may so say) of hisPs. 88:16: Mat: 26.46 wrath inIn the conside∣ration of a Surety. 2 Cor. 5:21. Gal: 3:13: another sense, and con∣sideration. 2. There is a dstinction, and dif∣ference to bee made, between the state, and the persons of men: it is undeniably true, that the state of nature is a state of wrath; but yet the persons in that state (I meane the Elect) may bee and are persons of love. As Absaloms rebel∣lion against his father David, was an Act deserving punishment, and his state a state of wrath, yet his
person, was still2 Sam. 18 33. & 19.4 affected and lo∣ved by David. Obj. But it doth not appeare, that the Elect are the children of God, before they do beleeve. A. Yes, the Scriptures prove it. As for example, theBy this Prodigall was meant the Gen∣tiles cal∣led Publi∣cans and sinners. Luke 15.1 Prodigal was a son, whilst yet dead, and his fa∣ther so ownes him. For this myLuk. 15.24 son (saith he) was dead and is alive. And againe (speaking to his eldest son) this thyv. 32. brother was dead and is alive. So these words (applyed to Christ)Heb. 2.13 Behold I, and the children which God hath given me: these Chil∣dren were the Elect, that Christ suffered for, and presented to his Father. ThatIoh. 11.52 Prophesie was also true (though spoken by a false man) that he (i.e. Christ) should gather together in one, all the children of God that were scattered abroad. Hereby you see, that all the Elect, are accoun∣ted, and termed the children of God, as well those uncalled, as those that are already called. Ob. But the Lord saith of the Gen∣tiles,
that he willRo. 9.23 call them his peo∣ple, which were not his people, which plainly shewes that God did not account them to be his people before they were called. A. The meaning is, that they were not his people by outward profession, as the Jewes were: but doubtlesse they were his people byRo. 11.2 fore knowledge andEph. 1.4 15. 1 Pet. 1.2. e∣lection, as our Saviour said of the same people, Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: Here marke, he ownes them to be his Sheep, though they were not as yet brought into the same sold. Ob. But the Apostle saith, that we are all the children of God byGal. 3.26 faith in Christ Jesus: so that untill we doe beleeve, we are not his children. A. Men may be said to be the children of God severall wayes, as bySo are all Angels & all men, Iob 1.6. & 2.1. Mal. 2 10. Creation, byEph. 1.5. , having sealed us unto the adoption. See Rom. 9.4. Election, and Adoption, and byGal. 3.26 Faith, andJam. 1.18 Ioh. 3.3. Mat. 18.3 Regeneration. In the lat∣ter of these senses, men are not the children of God, till they doe re∣ceive
the Spirit, and beleeve, yetGal. 4.6 because they are children, God gives his Spirit unto them. It is1 Joh 3.24 Rom. 8.16 impossible that any should know themselves to be Gods chil∣dren till they are converted, and do really and actually beleeve. Yet doubtlesse God may (and doth) know them to be his children long before; and if none could be Gods children save onely by faith, how then are those saved Infants, who doe not actually beleeve, (for ought we can gather from Scripture) the children of God. Q. Can men be saved any other way but by the Covenant of Grace? A. No sure, for men must bee saved either by the Covenant of grace, or by the Covenant of works (for there be but those two wayes) and the Apostle saith, ThatGal. 2.16 no man is justified by the workes of the Law. SoRo. 3.28. elsewhere he saith, That a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law, and thatRom. 4.6 righte∣ousnesse is imputed without works. If
then a man cannot be justified and saved by the Covenant of workes, and there be no other way but the Covenant of grace, of necessity men must bee saved that way, and by that Covenant, or not at all. Ob. But why cannot men be saved by the Covenant of works? A. Because the Covenant of workes, requires to salvation, that which no man can perform, viz.Ro. 10.6. personall,Gal. 3.10 perfect, andJam. 2.10 perpetuall obedience. Ob. But may not men be saved partly by the Covenant of works, and partly by the Covenant of grace? A. No, for if it is of grace, then it is no more of workes, otherwise grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace. So that it is inconsistent to grace to have workes joyned and added un∣to it, in the point of justification and salvation, Rom. 11.6. Q. Are men then saved onely by grace?
A. Oh yes, onely, and altogether by grace; for the whole way and path of salvation, is paved with the grace of God the Father, and the grace of Jesus Christ; the grace of love, the grace of good will, the grace of mercy, and the grace of Christ his merits and obe∣dience. So that from everlasting, to everlasting, from the first minute of time, that God intended mens salvation, to the last moment of Eternity (if I may so expresse it) there was nothing, and there will be nothing but grace in mens sal∣vation;Ro. 11.5 their predestination, and election, their2 Tim. 1.9 Gal. 1.15. calling, and voca∣tion, theirRo. 3.24. Tit. 3.7. redemption, and justi∣fication, theirRo. 9.26 adoption, andEzek. 36 25, 26. sanctification, theirRo. 5.2. con∣firmation, and consolation, their2 Cor. 12 9. preservation and supportation, theirRo. 5.17 perseverance andTit. 3.5. glori∣fication, flowes all from free grace,Eph. 1.7. and 2.7. riches, and exceeding riches of grace. Nothing moved God to will mens salvation, but his good
Pleasure, nothing perswaded God to send his Son Jesus Christ,God gives all to men does all for men, and works all in men freely. Hos. 14.4. Ro. 8.32. Rev. 21 6. & 22.18. Esa. 26.12 & 55.1, 2. to worke mens redemption, but his meere and dear love. Observe, here is nothing of self-will, nothing of self-righteousnesse, nothing of selfe-power, neither fore-seene faith, nor fore-seen workes, no qualifications, nor conditions, no preparations, nor performances, no duties, nor deserts of men, having so much as avoice, the least hand, or place, in their salvation. The first and the last stone, yea all the materialls in this glorious building of mens salvation, is hewne out of the Quarry of Gods unspeakable Grace. Oh soule, consider how the God of grace owned thee, how the Lord of grace bought thee, how the Word of grace called thee, how the Herbe of grace hea∣led thee, and how the Spirit of grace wrought in thee, and sealed thee; yea when thou didst slight,
and reject grace, then (like Hester) thou didst obtaine grace above thousands; cry therefore, Grace, Grace, and say, I had perished, and been damned for ever, had it not beene for Gods grace, for where my sinne did abound, his grace did abound much more: and when I was exceedingly gracelesse, the Lord was more abundantly, and exceedingly gracious. Ob. If men are saved onely by grace, how then is it said, thatLuk. 7.50 faith,Ro. 8.24 hope, the1 Co. 15.2 Gospel, and1 Pet. 3.21 Baptisme, do save men? A. I. Faith, hope, the Gospel, and Baptisme, are allEph. 2.8 2 The. 2.16 1 Cor. 2.12 fruits, and effects of Gods grace, and gi∣ven freely unto men, and so inclu∣ded in grace; and therefore to be saved by any of these, is to be saved by grace, for these are of grace: But, Secondly, Faith, hope, the Go∣spel, Baptisme, &c. are considered as the instrumentall meanes of mens salvation. As the Apostle2 The. 2.13
saith, That God hath chosen men to sal∣vation through sanctification of the Spi∣rit, and beliefe of the truth. Marke, he doth not say, for sanctification, and beliefe of the truth, (as making those the causes of mens salvation) but through sanctification, and beliefe of the truth, making those the meanes of salvation. As God hath ordai∣ned that men should live by food, and rayment; yet food and ray∣ment is not the proper cause of life, but the ordinary meanes (be∣ing blessed) for the preservation of life. Ob. If men be saved onely by grace, why then doth the Lord command men to seek, strive, run, fight, work, and the like. A. The Lord doth not give these exhortations, as if he inten∣ded that men should be saved, or further their own salvation by ob∣serving and obeying them; (for God saithRo. 9.16 else where, That it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that run∣neth, but in the Lord that sheweth mer∣cy.) But these exhortations are to
be considered either as belonging to unbeleevers, and sinners; or unto beleevers and Saints. When they are spoken unto sinners, then they are to be understood in the same way as the Law is to be understood (yea urged upon the same ground) sei to shew unto men what they should doe,Most ex∣hortations do belong unto Saints (because they are fittest and ablest to performe them) as appears in the Epi∣stles, which were writ∣ten to Sts. Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1. Phil. 1.1. though they cannot doe it. But when these exhortations are spoken unto Saints, they are to be looked upon as Gospel duties, which Saints are to performe; not to bee justified, but because they are justi∣fied; not to gaine Gods love, but to shew their love to him; not to get and procure life, but because they are already certaine and sure of life. Further consider, that godly ex∣hortations, are seldome or never single, but commonly (if not al∣wayes) joyned with sutable pro∣mises. And God doth not onely put his people upon duties, but hee alsoZach. 10.12. Ioh. 14 13 14. ingages himselfe to helpe them to performe them. Q. Whether doth God tender the
Covenant of grace to all, yea or no? A. Doubtlesse, God tenders the Covenant of grace, or the Gospel (which is theAct. 20.24. same) to allMat. 28.19. Tit. 2.11. Mat. 24.14. Na∣tions, and toMar. 16.15. Act. 13 10. every creature; and it is the minde of God, that every Mes∣senger and Minister of his, should de∣clare and publish this Covenant to all, without respect of per∣sons. Q. Have any men of themselves (or naturally) a will, and power to receive and beleeve this Covenant of grace (or the Gospel) when it is tendred unto them? A. No surely, they have neither will nor power of themselves, and unlesse it beIoh. 3.27 & 6.65. & 15.5. given them of God, it is impossible any should receive or beleeve it. For all men by nature areIer. 17.9, Iob 21.14 Iob. 5.40. 2 Per. 2.10 desperately wil∣full,2 Cor. 3.5 Rom. 5.6. absolutely weake, andGen. 6.5. & 8.21. Psal. 10.4. See marg. altogether wicked, having neither spirituall defire nor strength, nei∣ther spiritualli e. De∣sires and affections, Eccl. 4.17 Psal. 17.5. feet to carry them to this grace, nor spiritualli. e. Power Pro. 3.27. Eccl. 9.10. hands to receive this grace when it is
brought and offered unto them. But as the ApostleRom. 8.7 saith, The carnall minde is enmity against God, it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. Ob. If men have no will nor power to come to Christ, and to partake of him; why then doth Christ complaine, that the Jewes would not come to him? Joh. 5.40. A. That does not import, that they had either will or power in them∣selves to come unto him, but ra∣ther that there was an unwillingnesse or non-willingnesse in them; so that it may be better called a publicke and negative will, then a free will; for it had no pronenesse nor ten∣dency at all in it to come to Christ. But like thatMat 21.28.29. sonne who was commanded to goe to the Vine∣yard, that answered and said I will not. Ob. Why doth Christ by his Spirit, invite men (saying, Whosoever will, let him come to the water of life) if they have no will, Rev. 22.17.
A. That is to incourage those poore soules, whom he had before made willing, who were afraid to come unto him; or else he makes this generall invitation, that so none might object, and say, they were not called, nor invited: and this agreeth with the invitation of our Saviour to the Jewes,Ioh. 7.37 If any man thirst (saith he) let him come unto me, and drinke. Bee sure of this, that if any be willing to come unto Christ, that is more then meer na∣ture; & it may be truly said to such, (as Christ said to Simon Peter) That flesh and blood hath not wrought this in them. For as Christ said unto the Leper,Mat. 8 3 I will bee thou cleane; so he must say unto men, I will that you be willing. And poore weak sunners, had need say to Christ, as Christ said to his Father,Mar. 14 7 Not as I will, but as thou wilt. Ob. But how could the Apostle say, To will is present with me, unlesse be had a willingnesse in him? A. The Apostle did not speak or
write those words, as the words of an unconverted man, but as hisRom. 7.18. own words, and that upon his own experience after his conversion. Also the same Apostle, doth inPhil. 2.13 ano∣ther place, acknowledge, That it is God that worketh both to will and to doe; and therefore it is not in man, of himselfe, either to will or to doe that which is good. Ob. But God gives to every man a will, and makes every man willing. A. First, if God gives to every man a will, and makes every man willing, then 1. This will and willingnesse is not in themselves naturally, and so it deserves not to be called mans will any longer, but Gods will. But, 2. If God hath given this will to all, and made all willing, then doubtlesse, he hath converted all; for the chiefest part of conversion, doth consist in the change of the will. Secondly, There is no Scripture that saith God gives a will to all, or
makes all willing. But the Scrip∣ture speakes restrictively, rather then generally in this point. AsPsa. 110.3 thy people (not all) shall be willing in the day of thy power. So ChristJoh. 5.21 saith, That he quickneth whom hee will. Ob. But as Christ is willing to save all, so he is also, to give and impart all saving gifts, and graces unto all. A. Christ is willing to save all, and he is very free to give, and ve∣ry free in his gifts, and graces; yet notwithstanding, he gives accord∣ing to his good pleasure. As a charitable man, wishes well to all poore people, yet he is free to give his charity, to whom he pleaseth. And as it isRev. 17.17. said (in another case) Its God that puts it in mens bearts, to doe his will: So it may be said here, when God makes men willing, then they become willing, and when God works power, then men are inabled, and not till then: for no man (as Christ saith)Ioh. 6.44 can come to him except the Father
draw him. And no man can have a sanctified will, till the LordIam. 1.18. by his own will, begets it in him. Therefore you that are willing, oh, blesse and praise God, who hath made you so! and you that are un∣willing, pray and wait, for the day of his power in which you shall be made willing. Ob. But doth not God give to every man some Talent or Talents, which if a man did improve should bee increa∣sed? A. 1. Its very true, that God gives toMat. 25.25. every man some Ta∣lent or Talents, as to some, worldly and naturall Talents (as Wisdome, Wealth, Art, &c.) and to others, spirituall Talents, or1 Cor. 12 8, 9, 10. Gifts (as to Pray, Prophesie, Interpret, worke Miracles, &c.) And question∣lesse, there is no man that improves his Talent so well, as he might im∣prove it. And God may upon the non-improvement of what wee have, deny us more; and where he findes us faithlesse in a little, its
but meet that hee should deny us much. Also God may very justly damne men for not improving what he gave them, and call them to an account, as a Lord doth his faithlesse, and unprofitable Steward. Therefore the very Heathens that had but the light of Nature, will beRo. 1.20, 21, & 2.15. inexcusable at the day of judgement, for not walking and acting according toRo. 2.15 that light and instinct in them, though they never heard Scripturall Law, nor Gospel. But yet, 2. Observe this, that to sinne against the Law of Nature onely, is enough to damne men, yet the improving of the Law of Nature, is not sufficient to save men. For there is aIoh. 17.3 knowledge of Christ,Ioh. 3.36 & 8.24. faith on him, andPsal. 2.12 Luk. 19.27 obedience to him, required as absolutely ne∣cessary to salvation, and all these, they are free, and Covenant gifts graces bestowed on men, and given to them according to the purpose and counsell, and by the free love,
and speciall grace of God. Obj. But if God gives grace unto some, and not unto others, is he not par∣tiall therein? A. God is just in all his wayes, and righteous in all his dealings, and therefore cannot be partiall, for he wrongs no man, but gives to every one according as he pleas∣eth, only to some he gives better then their deserts (and this is his mercifull and gracious dealing) and to others according to their deserts, and this is his righteous and just dealing.Mat. 20.15 And is it not lawfull for him to doe what hee will with his owne? This should silence, and satisfie men, that for God to give grace to any, is to doe for them more then they could, or can de∣serve, and for God not to give grace to others, is not to deal worse with them, then they deserve. Quest: How did it stand with Gods justice, to make a Covenant of grace with men? A: God in making the Covenant
of grace, at first,Justice and mercy doubtlesse were ty∣ped out by the Cheru∣bims wings that look∣ed one to∣wards an∣other. Ex. 25.20. had reference to the satis faction of his Justice, as well as to the setting forth of his Mercy, though not from the hands of men yet from the hands of Christ. For God promised at first, to Christ to shew mercy, no otherwise then Christ pro∣mised, to satisfie his justice: so that up∣on the account of Christ, God made the Covenant of grace. As a man that makes and settles his estate up∣on his Sonnes wife, and her chil∣dren, upon some former considera∣tion, and agreement past between him and his Son, so doth God by his Covenant of grace, settle upon the Church (Christ's Spouse) and her children, the promised inheritance, by vertue of theZac: 6.13 Counsell (and Co∣venant) of peace, which was betweene them both. Quest: Does the Covenant of grace (or the Gospell) require duties and workes? A. Oh yes, in a veryLuk: 1.74 Rom: 6.4. strict, andIoh: 4 24. 1 Tim: 4.12 spirituall manner, both toAct 20.21 Luk: 12.21 God, andGal: 6.10 men: yea the Covenant
of grace, requires some duties that the Covenant of workes and the Law requires not, as after Ile shew, but yet there is a great difference, in the two Covenants requiring of duties. Quest: But wherein lyes the diffe∣rence between the Covenant of grace, and the Covenant of workes in requiring du∣ties? A. 1. The Covenant of grace (or the Gospell) doth not require du∣ties, and workes to justification, and salvation: for the ApostleRom: 3. 24, 28. and 46. concludes that a man is justified and saved by grace, without the workes of the Law, or legall duties: But the Cove∣nant of workes, or the LawRom. 10.5 re∣quires workes and legall duties, to justification and salvation. 2. The Covenant of grace doth not only require duties, but also teacheth men where to findeEph: 6.10 2 Tim. 2.1. strength to performe those duties; yea, promiseth as much as itEz: 11.19 Heb 8.9.10 re∣quireth; But the Covenant of workes, doth neither promise, nor
give power to doe the duties it re∣quireth. 3 The Covenant of grace doth not require duties, upon paine and pe∣nalty of damnation; but toIoh: 14, 15 & 15.14. ex∣presse our love to Christ, But the Cove∣nant of works, requires duties and works uponMat. 5.19 paine and penaltie of damnation. 4. Though the Covenant of grace doth require dutys, & performances, yet it does not exact upon men, but where there is a sincere aime, and a true desire in any, it is accepted, though they come very short in per∣formance. As God accepted of Davids1 K. 8.18. intent to build him an House, and of AbrahamsHeb: 11, 17 resoluti∣on to offer up his Son I saack.Lu 21.2.3 Two mies, nay,Mat: 10.42. It is not the gift, but the giver; not what is in the hand, but what is in the heart, that God looks at: a cup of cold water, is looked upon, and accepted by God, when it comes from an ho∣nest and true heart. Yea, this is the voice and language, of the Co∣venant of grace, that where there is first a willing mind, it is accepted, accor∣ding to that a man hath, and not accor∣ding
to what he hath not. But the Co∣venant of works requires exact, per∣fect, personall, and perpetuall o∣bedience, and upon the least trans∣gression, and swerving from the commandement, it denounces that most dreadful, & unmitigable curse.Gal: 3.10 cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. Do but compare both Covenants together and you will find, that the Cove∣nant of grace requires butMat. 11.29 easie duties, and performances; but the Covenant of workes requires, irk∣some, toylsome, and chargeable du∣ties, and performances. Obj. Doe you call plucking out the right eye, cutting off the right hand, de∣nying our selves, taking up the crosse dai∣ly, &c. but easie duties? A. 1. As SolomonPro. 14.6. 1 Iob. 5.3. saith, To him that bath understanding, knowledge is easie; so to them that are spiritu∣all, the Commandements of God areRo: 7.22 easie and not grievous. For it is somewhatCor. 5.14 & 11.8. naturall to a rege∣nerate
man to obey God, as it is to a wife, or a childe to obey the hus∣band, or father. 2. The duties commanded in the Covenant of grace, are easie to beleevers, because Christ performes them, in, and for them. As the ApostleGal. 2.20 said, It is Christ that li∣veth in me.Phil. 4.13 Againe, saith he, I can doe all things through Christ that strengtheneth me. The weight lyes more heavy upon the shoulders of Christ, then upon mens shoulders;Christus jubet, & juvat: litera jubetur, spiritu do∣natur. as the care of providing for the family, is more upon the father, then upon the children; and the husbandman is as much, and more concerned in the fruitfulnesse of his field, then his servant, though the servant works also. Q. But doth not the Covenant of grace also threaten Beleevers (that are under it) if they be disobedient, and commit sin? A. Yea sure, there bee threat∣nings that doe belong to the Co∣venant of grace, (or the Gospel)
and these threatnings concerne those Beleevers that are under it; but yet they are not such threat∣nings as are the threatnings of the Law, viz. threatnings of damnation. Q. What then are those threatnings of the Covenant of grace, that concerne beleevers? A. GodPsa. 89.31, 32. 2 Sam. 7.14 saith (concerning beleevers) That if they breake his Sta∣tutes, and keep not his Commandements, he will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their iniquities with stripes. Ob. Doth the Lord then chastise his owne children for their sins? A. 1. Though most commonly Gods indulgence,Num. 23 21. Exo. 34.6. affection, and ten∣dernesse to his children be so great, that he passes by millions of fai∣lings in them, withoutIam. 1.5 so much as upbraiding or reproving them, much lesse correcting or chastising them. And though at other times God does correct them, but notIob 1.8. at all for their sinnes (as he did Job) but toJoh. 9.3 glorifie himself, and to make themHeb. 12.10. partakers of
his holinesse; yet, 2. Without doubt, God doth sometimes chastise his children for their sinnes; as he did the Corinthi∣ans, for their unworthy and unholy par∣taking of the Lords Supper. For the Apostle saith, For this cause many are weake and sickly among you, and ma∣ny are fallen asleep. So Christ threat∣ned the Churches ofRev. 2.16 Pergamus,v. 20.22. Thiatyra, andChap. 3.16 Laodicea. Ob. But what wayes and kindes doth the Lord use to chastise his chil∣dren? A. 1. Sometimes in their souls, byPsal. 51.8, 9.10, 11. withdrawing, or withold∣ing the sweet presence, and power∣full working of his gracious and free Spirit; whereby their soules are filled with sorrow, trouble, and terrour; insomuch that they oft cry out, like thePsal. 77.9 Prophet, Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath hee in anger shut up his tender mercies? 2. Sometimes the Lord chasti∣seth his children in their bodies, withPsal. 38.7, 8. sicknesse, and weaknesses,
as you heard before of the Corin∣thians. 3. Sometimes the Lord chastises them in their children, friends, and estates; as he did2 Sam. 12 14, 15. David,1 Sam. 3 12.4.13. Eli, and others. 4. Sometimes the children of God may be2 Thes. 3.14. suspended, and ex∣communicated out of the society of Saints, cast out of the Church, and delivered unto Satan, as the1 Cor. 5.5 incestuous person was, who not∣withstanding doubtlesse was a2 Cor. 2.6, 7, 8. true beleever. Ob. How doth it consist with Gods love, that he should correct and chastise his children? A. Oh consider! that Gods chastisements, are but fatherly Re∣membrances, and speciall signes of his love. As the Apostle saith, Whom the Lord loveth heHeb. 12.6. . the Greek word signi∣fies as wel instru∣ction, as correction so the He∣brew word musar, sig∣nifies. Prov. 3.12 chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he recei∣veth. The Lord corrects his owne children to shew his care of them, and also because they are not to be1 Cor. 11.32. Jer. 30.11. condemned with the world;
therefore they should not set light by his correction, as the, Heb. 12.5. phrase is. God oftentimes leaves the wicked and ungodlyIob 21.9 unpunish∣ed: And its one of the greatest judgements, for God to give a man his fullHos. 4.17 Pro. 14.14. As Abra∣ham, its probable suffered Ishmael to persecute Isaac, be∣cause Ish∣mael was to depart, and Isaac to abide. So doth God suffer the wicked to perse∣cute his children. God called Ephraim his deare son, when he was un∣der cha∣stisement. Ier. 31.28. scope in sinne, and its a signe that God cares not for such a man that hee leaves uncorrected: And in this, God deales as men use to doe, viz. to have a stricter eye, and hand upon their children then upon strangers; because they intend that their children shall a∣bide in the house, (and enjoy a fa∣thers portion) but that strangers shall be cast out. Ob. But how can God correct his children for their sinnes, seeing Christ hath made satisfaction for them? A. Be confident of this, that God doth not chastise his children, because he is unsatisfied for their sinnes, or dissatisfied with their persons: For he hath said, that he hath found a ransome, and that he isMat. 3.17 and 17.5. well-pleased in Christ, and
doth much delight in them through him, and that their sinnes are notRom. 4.6 imputed unto them. As a naturall father doth not scourge his children,Saints should ac∣count it a great ho∣nour to have God lay his hands up∣on them. As some formerly accounted it an ho∣nour to be killed by the hands of Hercules or Aeneas. because hee is unreconciled to them, or because that should make satisfaction for their faults, but because that way may prove advantageous to his children for the time to come. So saith the Apostle, The Lord corrects his children that they may be partakers of his holinesse: And the ProphetEsa. 27.9. saith, By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged. Q. Doth the Covenant of grace, or the Gospel, give any liberty to sinne, or any incouragement for men to continue therein? A. Oh no; but it dothTit. 2.11. teach, and should teach all men, to deny all ungodlinesse, worldly and wicked lusts.Rom 6.1 14, 15. What shall we con∣tinue in sinne that grace may abound? God forbid. He that sinnes against the grace and Gospell of Christ, declares hee hath no grace, yea
such a one makes himselfe tenne times more gracelesse, then, if hee had never heard the Go∣spel. Ob. But there be many that say your preaching of free grace doth give li∣berty (and many take liberty thereby) to sin. A. 1. The preaching of free grace, doth not give liberty to sin; for then Christs preaching, and his Apostles preaching, did give liberty to sinne. For none ever preached grace soLu. 4.22 Mat. 9.13. Lu. 15.1, 2 and 1 Cor. 15.3. Ubi pater familias est largus, ibi dispensator, non debet esse avarus. freely to sinfull men as they did: And shall the Master be so free-hearted and full-handed, and the servant nigard of what is not his owne, but his Masters? 2. Suppose some doe abuse the grace and Gospel of God, must not therefore this Grace and Go∣spel be preached? Was the Manna to bee withheld from the many thousands of Israel (that wanted it) because some scornfull menNum. 11.6 slighted it, or because some unbeleeving men abused it? Shall
water be kept from the thirsty, be∣cause mad men drowne themselves therein? or shall wine be denied to the sad, and sorrowfull, because it makes some unsober? The Gospel is, and must be, (Though accident∣ally) the2 Cor. 2.16. savor of death to some, as well as the savour of life to others. As a sick man (whose stomach is weake and ill) when he hath eaten meat becomes ficker; so a sinfull man when hee hath heard the Go∣spel, may become more sinfull, yet as the cause of the sick mans ilnesse was not the meat, but for want of stomach, and strength, to digest it; so for want of faith to beleeve, and power to obey the Gospel, men become worse by it. 3. Consider this, that there were in the Apostles dayes many wanton, loose; carnall, and ungodly Professors, that didJud. v. 4. turne the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ into lasciviousnesse; and thereby did cause the true wayes, and servants
of God, to be evill spoken of. So there may be (and doubtlesse are) many in these dayes, that tread in the steps of those ungodly men, (as the SpiritRev. 2.14 speakes of some who held the doctrine of Balaam (ma∣ny hundreds of years after Balaams death) yet the Churches, and Saints of Christ, doe utterly hate and abhorre the vile, and wicked practices of such men; and they re∣fuse to have any fellowship with such, that they may bee ashamed; and doubtlesse, shame, sorrow,Rom. 3.8 2 Pet. 2.3. and damnation, will befall such men, as make Gods grace a stirrup for to help them up into the saddle of sin. Ob. But it is no wonder, that these men doe abuse the grace of God, seeing there is a generall tolleration granted them. A. The Churches, and Saints of Christ, doe not hold, nor grant a Generall Tolleration; witnesse the severall books which areAs Mr. Tho. Good∣wins Ser∣mon be∣fore the Parl. called The Interest &c. So M. Borroughs heart divi∣sion. Also many o∣thers. extant. This is therefore the opinion of
the Churches, that though they are tender in censuring, and judging, such as differ from them in mat∣ters of Discipline, and Govern∣ment, or other Circumstantialls. Yet they doe not, nor cannot approve of, or maintaine either the prin∣ciples, or practices of Hereticks (nor of Schismaticks truly so cal∣led.) Much lesse can they joyne with such men, for they deny them fellowship, yea such as deny the head Christ, and walk ungodlily, they excommunicate, and cast out of the Churches, accord∣ing to theTit. 3.10 1 Tim. 1.19, 20. 1 Cor. 5.5. Mat. 10.16, 17. The Chur∣ches of Saints (called Indepen∣dents) are neither for toleration, of heresie, nor any grosse ini∣quity. Scripture, and then leave them to the Civill Ma∣gistrate. And what can (or would) Presbyterians doe more, unlesse they would have the power of the Magistrate into their hands: Therefore let them not father that falshood upon Independents (so called) that they are for a Tolleration of all Sects and Opinions, whereas they plead onely for such as are truely consciencious, & not at all for those
that are carnal, and corrupt. Objection. But yet these Free∣gratians (or those that preach Free∣grace) doe altogether neglect the Law in their preaching, (nay they doe utterly reject, and destroy the Law) and this is the cause why so many doe run into errours and wickednesse in these dayes. A. As it was in the dayes of Christ, and his Apostles, so is it now, for then theyMat 5.17 thought (especially the Pharisees) that Christ did intend to destroy the Law. So they said of Stephen, that heAct. 6.13 spake blasphemous words against the Law. Al∣so of Paul, that heAct. 18 13 taught men to worship contrary to the Law, and that he taughtAct. 21.28 against the Law. Wherefore having (in some measure) cleared the Gospel, and Covenant of works, (being the first part of this Book) I now come to vindicate, and cleare the Law, or the Covenant of works, which is the second part of the Booke.
The second Part of this Treatise. Wherein, Most, of the materi∣all Questions con∣cerning the LAW, are briefly handled and cleared. Question. HOW is the word Law to bee understood, and in what sence is it taken in the Scriptures? Answer 1 It is taken for the whole Word (and revealed Will) of God. As Psal. 19.7. The Law of God is perfect converting the soule, so Jam. 1.25.
Whosoever looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, &c. here (and inSee more Psal. 37.31 and 119.1, 70. Pro. 6.23. & 28.9. severall other places) by the Law is meant the Word of God in ge∣nerall. Then 2 By the Law (sometimes) is meant all the bookes of the Old Testament, as John 10.34. Is it not written in your Law, I said ye are gods? so John. 15.25. This (saith Christ) is come to passe, that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their Law. 3 The Law is taken also more re∣strictively for the five bookes of Moses as Mat. 11.13. Iohn 1 45. and 12.34. Gal. 3.21: and so comprehen∣ding the Ceremonial, and Judici∣all Lawes, as well as the Morall Law, see 1 Cor. 9.18. Gal. 5.3. Ex. 21.1. 4 By the Law is meant the Morall Law, called in Scripture the Tenne Words or (usually by us) theDeu. 4.14 & 10.4. Ten Commondements or Decalogue, and in this sense, it may be applyed either to theRom. 3.21 Gal. 3.10, 11, 12 Deut 33.4. Joh. 1.17. whole Ten Commande∣ments, or toRom 13.8 one Table, or toRom 7.7 one particular Commandement thereof.
Quest. How many Lawes did God give unto men? Answ. Three, the Naturall Law, or the Law of Nature; the Mosaicall Law, or the Law of Moses; and the Evangelicall Law, or the Law of Christ. The first of these Lawes was given to Adam in his in∣nocent, and sinlesse condition; the second was given unto men in their fallen, and sinfull condition; and the third was given unto men, either to bring them out of their sinful condition, or being brought out of that estate, to guide them on to their eternall happy condi∣tion. Quest. Wherein did the naturall Law, or the Law which God gave unto Adam in his innocency consist? Answ. 1. In that inscription written in his heart, whereby (doubtlesse) he knew how to serve and worship God, his Creatour. 2 In that vocall prohibition of eating the forbiden fruit, Gen. 2.17. Object. But how doth it appeare that
there was any Law, written in the heart of Adam in his innocency? A. 1. Because that even the sinfull posterity of Adam (who had neither the written Law of Moses, nor the Gospell yet) had, and have this Law written in their hearts, their consciences bearing witnesse, and their hearts accusing or excu∣sing one another, Rem. 2.14, 15. 2 By the knowledge that he had in the nature of all creatures and therbyto name al creatures accord∣ing to their natures, Gen. 2.20, 23. 3 Because that Adam and his children did offer unto the Lord, and this must be either from inward dictates and teachings in nature, or from vocall commands; but we read not of any vocall commands that God gave to Adam thereto. Obj. But did God give lawes to none but unto Adam before Moses time? Answ. Yes, untoGen 6.13 Noah (and doubtlesse to many others) before the flood, and also toGen 26.5 Abraham, and the Patriarcks, after the flood
till the time of Moses, and these lawes are called (by the godly and learned) Positive Lawes. Qu. Was there included in that pro∣hibition to Adam (that hee should not eate of the forbidden fruit) all the Mo∣rall Law, or Ten Commandements, af∣terwards given to Moses? A. Though the Scripture doth not affirm that, neither can it be easily inferred thence, nor clearly proved, yet it's probable hee had written in his nature the substance of the Ten Commandements. Qu. Why did God give a law, or lawes unto men? A. To shew his own Soveraign∣ty, and his creatures duty. Qu. How many parts are there in the Lawes of God? A. Three, aEx 20.3, 4, 5, 7 &c. mandatory part, aEx 19.5 Eph 6, 2 promisary part, and aGen. 2.17 Lev 26.16 17, 18. penall part: the first shewing the power, the second the goodnesse, and the third the justice of God. Qu. Why did God give the Morall Law or Ten Commandements, seeing he
had before written the Law in mens hearts? A. Though the Law was writ∣ter at first in the heart of Adam, and though the fallen posterity of Adam, had,Why the Moral Law was given. (and still have) some reliques of that Law remaining in their hearts; yet it was growne so dymme, and dark that in a manner it was deleated, and blotted out by the sinnes of men: insomuch that the Apostle accounted that time between Adam and Moses, as a time wherein there was no Law, for saith he untill the Law (i. e. the Mo∣rall Law) sin was in the world, Rom. 5.13. But more particularly, God gave the Morall Law, First, because of transgressions, as the Apostle (in answer to such a Question tacitely propounded) saith, the Law was added because of trans∣gressions untill the seed (i. e. Christ) should come, Gal. 3.19. For the better understanding of this consider, 1 That the Law was given to disco∣ver sin, forRom 3:20 by the Law is the know∣ledge
of sinne. And thoughRom 5:13 sin was in the world before the Law, yet sin was so vailed, and covered; that men, when they did comit sin, they scarce knew that they sin'd. We have the Apostle Pauls testimony and experience of this, wher heRom 7:7 saith, that he had not knowne sinne but by the Law, for I had not known lust, (saith he) except the Law had said thou shalt not cover. Nay there would be no sin were it not for a Law; for the Law gives (if I may so tearme it) a being unto sin; and therefore is called the1 Cor 15:5 strength of sinne: for if a man should sweare, covet, or kill, and there should be no Law prohi∣biting the same, doubtlesse it would not bee evill (for the Law makes it evill.) So men when they doe commit sinne, if they be igno∣rant of the Law against which they sinned, they cannot come to see and know their sinnes, therefore the Law is the glasse or discoverer of sin, and where there is no Law, there is noi. e. No knowledge of trans∣gression. Rom 4.15 transgression.
Obj. But hath the Law of it selfe power to discover sin? A. No, not of it selfe, without it be applyed by the Spirit, for Paul thought himselfePhil 3.6 blame∣lesse (as concerning the Law) be∣fore his conversion, But when theRom 7.9 Commandement came in spirit and power, then sinne appeared, as sin to him. Obj. But doth the Morall Law dis∣cover unto men all their sinnes? A. Yes, All the sins committed against that Law, but not every sin that a man is guilty of; for the sin of unbeleife (or not beleiving in Christ) which is the sinJoh. 6.29 and 16.9. 1 Joh. 3.23 Neither doth the Moral law teach men to deny their owne righteous∣nesse. a∣gainst the Gospell, is discovered by the Gospell, and not by the Law. Obj. How doth it appeare that the Law doth not discover the sinne of un beleefe, or not beleeving in Christ? A. Because the Law doth not command faith in Christ as hee is Mediatour, neither can any man possibly preach Christ out of the
Morall Law: therefore it is impos∣sible that unbeleife against him, should be known, or apprehended by that Law. 2 The Law as it doth discover sin, so also it doth aggravate sinne, or make sin (as the ApostleRom 7.13 saith) ex∣ceeding sinfull. The Law does awa∣ken, and revive, and unkennell sins and make them take hold upon a mans soule. As the Prophet DavidPs. 40.12 said, mine iniquities have taken hold upon mee, so that I am not able to looke up: Or as the ApostleRo 7.8, 9 said, without the Law sin was dead, but when the Commandement (id est the Law) came, sinne revived, and I dyed, that is, his sinnes did appeare so hainous, grievous, and terrible to him, that they were ready to make him dis∣paire: also the same ApostleRom 5.20 elsewhere saith, That the Law enter∣ed that the offence might abound. 3 The Law does restraine sinne, and that was a maine end where∣fore it was given, which is the meaning of the Apostle in the
third of the Galathians 19 ver.Gal. 3.19. The Law was added because of transgression. Men were growne to a mighty height of transgression and wicked∣nesse, till God gave the Law, to curbe, checke, and chaine men, from running madly and greedily ac∣cording to the inclinations of their wicked and desperate hearts. And in that sense the1 Tim. 1.9 Apostle speakes, That the Law was made for the lawlesse and disobedient, for the ungodly and sin∣ners, &c. Even as amongst men, the occasion of making Lawes (com∣monly) is either some evill done, or foreseen will be don. God when he gave the Law at first to Israel, did see that they were prone to follow the wicked wayes and examples of the Egyptians, and therefore gives the Law by way of anticipation, and prevention. Secondly, The Law was given that it might be a Schoolemaster un∣to men, as the ApostleGal. 3.24. saith, the Law was our Schoolemaster unto. was unto Christ. So Calvin and others. Christ, Now the office of a Schoolemaster
(and so of the Law, as it is a Schoolemaster) consifts in two things. 1. In giving Instruction, the Law doth teach men what they should not do, and also what they should doe. For doe but look in∣to the Ten Commandements, and most of them are negative Com∣mands,Exod. 10 and teach men what they should not doe. As Thou shalt have no other gods but mee. Thou shalt not make to tby selfe any graven Image, &c. Yet when Jesus Christ reduces the ten Commandements into two, he delivers them affirmatively,Mat. 22.37, 39. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour as thy selfe. So that by compa∣ring both places together, it evi∣dently appeares, that the Law does teach men their duty negatively, and possitively, both towards God and men: And in this sense the law may be said to be a mans Counsellour, as DavidPs. 119.24 said, thy Statutes are my Counsellours. Also the Apostle saith,
the Scripture (whereof the Law is a part) is given for instruction, and without all controversie (call it a Rule or what else you please) the Law doth guide men in their du∣ties, and may be called a light unto a mans feete, and a Lamp unto his pathes. 2. The office of a Schoolemaster is to correct the undutifull, and dis∣obedient; This also the Law doth, for what is said of the2 Tim. 3.16. Scripture in generall may be appropriated to the Law in particular, viz. that it is for correction. Object. How doth the Law cor∣rect men? Ans. By rebukes and humili. ui∣ons, for when men have sinned the Law doth sharply, smartingly, and cuttingly wound and pierce their Consciences, that it makes them crie out as DavidPsal. 39.11. remove thy stroke away from me. Then it hum∣bles men, and makes them stoope and subject themselves with shame, and silence to the judgement of God.
As the Apostle speaks, what soever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law, that all the world may become guilty be∣fore God (or subject to the judge∣ment of God.) Rom. 3.19.Rom. 3.19. Quest. To whom was the Law a Schoolemaster, and how long was it to continue so? Answ. First, the Law was in a speciall manner a Schoolemaster to the people of the Iewes, and it was to continue as a Tutor and Teacher unto them,See Luther on Gal. 3.19. untill Christ came in the flesh, Gal. 3.19. The Law was added because of transgression, untill the seed should come; that is, till Christ should come in the flesh, and then according to that admini∣stration the Law ceaseth. Secondly, the Law is also a School∣master unto both Iewes and Gen∣tiles, untill such time as they doe believe in Christ, and are redeemed from the power and dominion of it. As the Apostles words plainly shew,Rom. 7.2. in Rom. 7.2. Know ye not (saith
he) how that the Law hath domi∣nion over a man as long as he liv∣eth; Marke those words, a man, i. e. every man, or any man, whe∣ther Iew, or Gentile, as long as he liveth, either under the Law, or undi∣vorced from it, the Law hath domi∣nion over him. Object.Object. I doe apprehend that the Law was a Schoolemaster onely to the people, and Nation of the Jews, and that it did not conccrne the Gentiles at all as a Schoolemaster: and that the meaning of that third of the Galathians the 25. vers. is, that the Law was no longer a Schoolemaster, then untill Christ came in the flesh, who is there cal∣led faith. Answ.Answ. Though some pious and able men are of that judgement, and though the word Faith be taken objectively for Christ: yet I suppose the text cannot be so restri∣ctively understood. First, because then you must hold that the Law was given to, and (in∣tended
for) the Iewes onely (which afterwards I shall shew to the con∣trary) for if it concernes the Gen∣tiles at all, doubtlesse it concernes them as a Schoolemaster, as long as they are under it. Then, Secondly, many, (or most) of the Galatians to whom that Epistle was writ, were Gentiles, and if the Law had never been a Schoolemaster unto them, then the Apostles assertion would not have been pertinent to them. Thirdly, by faith seemes to be meant there (as inGal. 1.23. & 32.1 Tim. 19. & 4.1. other Scrip∣tures) either the Gospell and word of faith, or else the grace and gift of faith, as it appeares in the 26. vers. We are all the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus; thats the se∣cond end of giving the Law. Thirdly, the Law was given to keep men under, and shut up men in sinne,Gal. 3 23. Before faith came (saith the Apostle) we were kept under the Law shut up unto the faith, and in ver. 22. The Scripture (i. e. then
saith) hath concluded all under sin. (i. e. till the doctrine of his grace was revealed, apply'd and believed) andRom. 11.32. shut them up in unbeliefe and disobedience: so that they may crie as the Prophet did. I am shut up, and I cannot get forth.Psal. 88.8. The Law of God is to a sinner as the Law of a Nation is to a Malefactor who transgresseth it, that hath fore'd to imprison and detaine the offendor, till that Law which he hath broken be satisfied. When a sinner is enlightned, and con∣vinced, so as to see his great danger by reason of sinne, he would like a Prisoner or Debtor, either com∣pound or make an escape; but the Law hath such an eye to him, and such a hand over him, that though he should seeke to worke the righte∣ousnesse thereof, and to escape dam∣nation thereby; yet it keeps him still to this, that there is no way to be freed or delivered, no meanes to be attempted or tried to escape, and avoid hell, unlesse he can finde out a meanes of satisfaction. Then,
Fourthly, The Law was given, that Christ, and his grace might be the more advanced. Rom. 5.20. More∣over the Law entered that the of∣fence might abound: but where sinne abounded, grace did much more abound. That is, God would have the Law come in to aggravate their sins, that thereby, a way might be made for him to display the banner of his grace. Doubtlesse there was this gracious end, and Evangeli∣call purpose in the promulgation, and setting up of the Law: and its Gods usuall way in enhanceing and ad∣vancing his love, grace, and mercy, to lead men forth first into a state and condition of distresse, and misery As he saith of IsraelHosea 2.14. I will allure her into the wildernesse (i.e. into a di∣stressed and afflicted condition) and there will I speak comfortably unto her. Object. How did the Law tend to exalt Christ, seeing you said before, the Law doth not at all hold forth, nor teach Christ?
Answ. Though its very true, that the Law doth not directly discover, and teach Christ, no more then a Statute made against Treason, or mur∣ther doth direct a Traitor, or mur∣therer, where, and how, to finde pardon: or a bond that engages a man to pay a great debt upon penal∣ty, shew him where to finde usoney, or a surety. Yet doubtlesse acciden∣tally the Law doth make a man seek, and prize Christ: even as the thun∣dring, lightning, and smoake made the Children of IsraellDeut. 5.27. desire Moses to be a Mediator between God and them. Fifthly, The Law was given that it might be both a standing Cove∣nant, and a standing Testament unto the end of the world. That it is a Covenant,Page 2. I have hinted before, and a Testament is very cleare, if you consider these Scriptures, Exod. 19.4.6. Deut. 4.13. Ier. 31.31, 32. Heb. 8.7, 8, 9. Gal. 4.24. Eph. 2.12. Heb. 8.8, 9. though the words in the lines be Co∣venants,
yet in the margents (which is the best translations) they are Te∣staments. Quest. What manner of Cove∣nant was, and is the Law? Answ. There be severall opinions herein and they may be reduced into these five, Either. 1. A Covenant of works, or, 2. A Covenant of grace, or, 3. A mix'd Covenant, both of works and grace, or, 4. A subservient, or annexed Covenant, or, 5. Arenewed Covenant. Yet as they differ one from ano∣ther, so shall I differ somewhat from them all. Quest. But before you shew us your owne judgement herein; Let us understand what they meane that hold those severall opinions, distinctions. Answ. First, they that understand it as a pure Covenant of works; con∣ceive, that about the Covenant God
did make it (and intend it,) to be a Covenant that should give life up∣on condition of keeping, and per∣forming it personally, and perfect∣ly. Secondly, they that thinke it to be a Covenant of grace, think that there was no Covenant of works made with men, since that made with∣in Adam in Paradice, before his fall, and so consequently it must be a covenant of grace. Thirdly, they that thinke it to be a mix'd Covenant, doe looke upon it as having some grace in it (as in the preface) I am the Lord thy God; and in the second Commandement, God shewing mercy unto thou∣sands. Fourthly, they that thinke it to be a subservient or annexed Covenant, say that God did give it as an apen∣dix to the Covenant of Grace which he made with Adam, and renewed with Abraham, Isaac, and Ia∣cob. Fifthly, they that make it a renew∣ed
Covenant, hold that the summe of the ten Commandements was in∣cluded in that command given to (or agreement made with) Adam: and that the giving of the ten Comman∣dements, or morall Law to Israell was nothing else, but a clearer and fuller delivery and discovery of that Law. Q. Now what manner of Co∣venant is the Law? and under what notion is it to be considered? Ans. The Law is considered two wayes; either as a Covenant, or else as a Testament, and so relates to two distinct sorts of persons; to the one in the former sense, and to the other in the latter sense. Q. What manner of Covenant is it? A. Doubtlesse a pure Covenant of works to some men (but not to all) and that appeares clearely by these three following reasons. 1.Reas. 1. Reas. Because it doth require works to justification and salvation. Lev. 18.5. Ye shall therefore
keepe my Statutes and my judge∣ments (saith the Lord) which if a man doe, he shall live in them. So Rom. 10.5. Moses describeth the righteousnesse of the Law, that the man which doth those things shall live by them. so Gal. 3.12. Ezek. 20.11. Rom. 2.13. 2. Reas.Reas. 2. Because it threatens damnation to those that doe not con∣tinue in doing the works (and per∣forming the conditions) thereof. Deut. Gal. 3.10. Deut. 27.26. Mat. 5.19. Iam. 2.10. and therefore must needs be a Covenant of works. 3. Reas.Reas. 3. That which is directly opposite to the Covenant of grace in point of justification, and salvation, must needs be a Covenant of works; but the Law is so, see Gal. 3.18. Rom. 4.2.6. & 6.14, 15. & 11.6. Eph. 2.8, 9. Object.Object. But doth not the Apo∣stle say, Is the Law against the promises? importing strongly it was not against the Promises. Gal. 2.21.
Answ. One thing may be said to be contrary to another, either in way ofMat. 12.30. enmity and opposition, and inconsistencie: or else in tearmes and conditions. In the former of these senses the Law is not against the promises; for they are both of them the will of God, and consist without destroying each other, or being ad∣versaries one to another; But in their tearmes and conditions they are very contrary one to another; for the one requires works, and the other faith (which conditions areSee the Script. in the third Reason. often put in opposition one to another:) Secondly, the meaning of that text in the Galathtans, (that the Law is not against the promise) may be this that the Law did not, nor could not hinder the promises to justifie those that did believe in Christ, and in the promises. As a Statute-law (amongst men) though it be against the justifying of a man that breaks it, yet it cannot hinder a man to be justified, and acquitted by a pardon of grace. Luther gives
this exposition of the place that the promises of God hangeth not upon the Law; for his promise doth not stand upon our worthinesse, neither doth our sinnes committed against the Law, hinder God to performe his pro∣mises to us. Object.Object. Sure the Law or ten Commandements could not be a Covenant of works, because the Covenant of grace was given foure hundred and thirty yeares before it. Answ.Answ. Vpon the same ground there should be no Covenant of works at all; for the Covena nt of grace was ever before the Covenant of works, and God did never intend the salvation of men no other way then by grace, as I have in the first part of this book proved. Object.Object. You say the Law is a Covenant of works, in what sence doe you understand it to be a Cove∣uant of works? Answ.Answ. The greatest doubt and kruple about the Law doth consist in
this objection, and upon this hinge chiefly doth the dore (of entrance into the right understanding of the Law and Gospell) and whole weight of the Controversie concerning this Subject hang. Therefore I will plainly (though briefly) declare what I ap∣prehend to be the truth herein, which is this. God did not give the Law (or ten Commandements) intentionally, and with purpose that any should be saved thereby; For he knew that none (af∣ter the fall) could possibly keep, and observe the same. Also he did fully intend, and purpose to save all such as should be saved (and that he had ordained to salvation,) by Je∣sus Christ, through the Covenant of grace, without the works of the Law, as is clear in 2 Tim. 1.59, 10. Tit. 1.2. Rom. 3.24, 25. Object.Object. But then you will say, how is it a Covenant of works? Answ.Answ. Its a Covenant of works occasionally, and accidentally, & only othose that are not related to, com∣prehended
in, or made partakers of the Covenant of grace. And in that sence I conceive those words are to be understood in the 1 Timo. 1.9. Knowing this that the Law is notit signifies is not put, or put over them. made for a righteous man, but for the lawlesse and disobedient, &c. that is, the Law was not intend∣ed, nor ordained (I meane as a Covenant) for a justified man that walks obediently, but for an unju∣stified man that walks disobediently. Consider this, that from the begin∣ing of the world, there were two Co∣venants in force and being, and all the world were (under) one of those two Covenants, (and still are, and will be) to wit, under the Co∣venant of works, or the Covenant of Grace. And herein is the myste∣ry great that many unbelieving, and ungodly men, that shall be dam∣ned, were under the outward admi∣nistration of the Covenant of grace, but not really and actually under it, so as to be saved by it: also the elect and believers were under the out∣ward
administration of the Cove∣nant of works, yet not so as to perish or be damned thereby. Object.Object. But I doe not well un∣derstand how the Law is occasio∣nally and accidentally a Covenant of works, therefore explaine what you meane thereby. Answ.Answ. 1. I meane that God did not directly give the law unto any to be saved by it: or say unto any, Loe here is my Law which I have prescri∣scribed and assign'd, as a way and meanes for you to be saved, and I intend your salvation this way, and by this meanes, and I will deale with you upon this tearme and condition, keepe my Law, and observe my com∣mandements, and you shall be saved. Yet secondly, consider, that God deales with those who are Iusticia∣ries (and that looke to be justified by the works of the Law: and re∣fuse to accept of justification and fal∣vation by Christ, and the Covenant of grace) under the Covenant of works. As theMat. 19 15, 17, 18. man in the Gos∣pel
who would by doing have eter∣nal life Christ sent him to the Law, not that Christ did inrend that he should be saved by the Law, but because the man himselfe was conceited that he should be saved that way, and resolved that he would not be saved any other way. As when PaulActs 25.11.12. ap∣peal'd unto Cesar, Festus answered him, unto Caesar shalt thou goe. So when a man appeales to the Law (or Covenant of works) God saith to him, seeing thou hast appeal'd unto the law, to the law thou shalt goe. But as AgrippaActs 26.32. said of Paul, this man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar; So may it be said unto that man that appeales to the Law; if he had not appealed to it, he might have been set at Liberty by Christ, and the Co∣venant of grace. Thus you fee the Law is not a Covenant of works to those that are saved, nor ever was in∣tended for that end. But on the o∣ther side, it is a Covenant of works to those that are damned, and this is
occasioned by themselves. So that in oriefe it is thus; all that perish, and loose their soules stand upon their owne justification, and in so doing, God is necessitated (to speake with reverence) to put them upon the try∣all of the Law, and to say unto them thus; You that have refused to submit unto my Gospell, and to ac∣cept forgivenesse and salvation through my Sonne, upon the tearme of believing, and have put your selves upon my Law, and your owne workes, you shall be tryed thereby, and in case you can bring such a righ∣teousnesse as my Law requires,Oh but who can doe this. See Rom. 3.20. and that you can worke the conditions thereof: I will pardon and discharge you from all your sinnes, and you shall be saved. But if you cannot (as it is impossible to fulfill the Law in every point) then shall the Law have the full force of a Covenant of workes over you, and you must be judgedRom. 2.12. Jam. 2.12. according to the Law, andRev. 20.12, 13. 2 Cor. 5.10. according to your workes, and must undergoe all the curses
and plagues denounced in the Law against the Transgressors of it. Quest. Having shewed how the Law is a Covenant, (and in what sence it is a Covenant of workes) now declare where it is called a Testament, and in what sence it is so called? Ans. First, that it is called a Te∣stament, these following Scriptures doe plainely declare, Gal. 4. 24. Eph. 2.12. Heb. 8.8, 9. and 9.4.15.17. Rev. 11.19. Though in some of these places it be read in our Bibles Covenant, yet in the last translation (as you shall finde in the margent) it is Testament, and so the word doth most properly signifie. Secondly, It is called a Testament, because it is the will of Jesus Christ, which he hath left and established for his owne Disciples and believ∣ers as well as others; But here is the difference, the Law is stablished by Christ as an absolute Covenant of works to those that believe not, (as
he (saithMat. 5.18. That not one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise passe from the law till all be fulfilled. i. e. fulfil∣led by them that were Pharisees, to whom he spake this. But the Law is established only and meerely Testament, to believers, to declare what he would have them yield obedience in love, and not upon condition of salvation, nor upon pe∣nalty of damnation.Joh. 14.15. If ye love me (saith he to his Disciples) keep my Commandements.Joh. 15.14. And yee are my friends if ye doe whatsoever I command you. Object.Object. But is not the Gospell the Testament, and will of Christ rather then the Law.Answ. Answ. BothJoh. 6.39. Gospell, andRom. 12.2. Law are his will, andMat. 22.37, 38, 39. insti∣tuted by him, the one as well the o∣ther, and both to continue in force one as long as another. Yet this is very true that the Gospell is the chief∣est part of Christ's will, and the best Testament (because it is stablished uponHeb. 8.6. better promises) as after∣wards I shali shew.
Quest. Is the Law or (ten Com∣mandements) morall, and doth it remaine in force now, in the dayes of the new Testament, and since Christ, as well as before? Answ. Yes doubtlesse,Answ. the Law is morall, and doth continue in force, as well since Christ as before, but yet there is some difference in the admi∣nistration of it since Christs com∣ming, and the administration of it before his comming. Quest. How, is it proved that the Law remaines in force since Christs time?Reas. 1. To prove the conti∣nuance of the Law, now in the dayes of the Gospell. Reas. 1. Because Christ hath not taken it away, for he saithMat. 5.17. He came not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it: and these words Christ speakes to the Iewes, who had a prejudice against him, as thinking he did intend to destroy the Law. But Christ bids them that they should not thinke that he came to destroy it. But rather (as in another place) he exhorts them toMal. 4.4. to remem∣ber the Law of Moses the servant of the Lord.
Object.Object. But then Christ had not fulfilled the Law, which since he hath done, and therefore is called the end of the Law. Rom. 10.4. Answ. Doubtlesse Christs fulfil∣ling the Law,Answ. did not tend to the utter and perfect destroying of the Law,Note that Christ is not called abso∣lutely the end of the Law, but the end of Law for righteous∣nesse, and that not to all, but to those that doe believe. Rom. 10.4. Reas. 2. and to the taking of it away, that it should continue no longer: but his fulfilling the Law was to sa∣tisfie the Law for the sinnes of those, that did and should believe; And Christ was the end of the Law for righteousnesse (or as it was a Co∣venant of works) and that not to all, but to every one that believeth, as the Apostle saith in that place. Reas. 2. Another Reason to prove the continuance (or morali∣ty (of the Law is, that theSee 1 Joh. 2.4. Apo∣stles did approve of, and establish the Law. As for example, saith Paul, The Law isRom. 7.12.14. holy, just, good and spirituall, if it be1 Tim. 1.8. lawfully used. And in another place, he take away that suspicion that some had of him, or an objection that they might
make against him, that he did over∣throw the Law totally.Rom. 3.31. Doe we then (saith he) make voyd the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the law. It is as if he had said, you Romans, doe not mistake, and misjudge me, about the Law, neither thinke you that by my preach∣ing, and tendring the Covenant of grace unto sinners so freely: or my care in bringing believers from un∣der the Law, and the Menaces, threatnings and curses thereof, I doe intend to destroy and nullifie the Law: oh noe! I am so farre from destroying the Law hereby, that I doe rather confirme it, according to the intent, and purpose of God in giv∣ing and instituting it. Reas. 3.Reas. 3. Because the Apostles did cite and urge the Law, both for the doing of good, and against the com∣mitting of evill. When the Apostle Paul teaches the Church of Co∣rinth, how she was bound to main∣taine her Ministers, he urges the Law for it.1 Cor. 9.9. Say I these things
as a man? or saith not the Law the same also?See Eph. 6.1. 1 Cor. 14.21. for it is written in the Law of Moses, thou shalt not muz∣zle the Oxe that treadeth out the corn. So Iames saith,Jam. 2.8. If ye fulfill the royall Law ye doe well: Againe,Jam. 2.9.11. Iames, and1 Joh. 3.4. Iohn agree in this, that whoever commits sinne, (kills or the like) transgresseth, and breaketh the Law. Reas. 4.Reas. 4. Because men are blamed, and condemned for breaking and transgressing the Law. Thou that makest thy boast of the Law through breaking the Law, dishonourest thou God. Rom. 2.23. and that by Law, here is meant the morall Law appeares evidently in ver. 21.22. See also Rom. 12.19. Many more Rea∣sons I might alleadge for to prove the morality and continuance of the mo∣rall-law in the dayes of the Gospell, but these are sufficient. Object.Object. Though the MORALL LAW doth continue in the dayes of the Gospell, yet it concernes not believers, neither doth it belong
unto them: for they are free from it, and dead to it, under it, as the Scripture frequently speakes. Answ. Though it be a blessed truth (and worth our understanding and knowlege) that believers are free from the Law,Answ. dead to the Law, and not under the Law yet in receiving this truth we must have a care that we doe not entertaine an errour with it. Therefore I will dis∣cover (according to the Light I have) in what sence this is true, and in what sence it is not, and how the morall∣law doth concerne beleevers, and how it doth not, and that I may make it the plainer appeare, I will state it in these three Questions. Quest. 1. Of what uses, and con∣cernment, is the morall-law unto be∣lievers. Quest. 2. How and in what sences are believers free from the law, dead to the law, and delivered from the Law? To answer the first Question. Quest. Of what uses and con∣cernment
is the morall unto be∣lievers? Ans. 1.Answ. It doth discover unto them what manner of God their God is, for as his Law is that comes from him, such he himselfe is. His Law as you heard before, is holy, and just, and good: so is God himselfe,Joh. 24.19. 1 Sam. 6.20. a holy God, whose nature isHeb. 1.9. Hab. 1.13. ut∣terly against sinne, and whose eyes cannot behold iniquity, a justEsa. 45.24. God, who will not justifie, nor acquit theExod. 24.7. guilty, without satisfaction for sinne; and yet a good GodLuk. 18.19. who hath made his son2 Cor. 5.21. to be sinne for sinners and aGal. 3.13. curse for those that were under the curses of the Law. Oh! let believers looke upon the Law of God, that they may con∣sider what manner of God their God is. Object.Object. It is not a legall know∣ledge of God (or a knowledge of him by the law) that is enough for believers to have, but they must know him a reconoiled God to them, and as a Father, and this know∣ledge
the Gospell onely teacheth. Answ. Its very true, that a legall knowledge of God is not enough to save men:Answ. and that it is the Gospell that doth discover God, as a reconci∣led God and Father. Yet doubtlesse, believers, when they have a Gospell∣knowledge of God, are not exclu∣ded, nor prohibited from a legali knowledge of him. As the children of a King or Emperour know their father to be their Soveraigne and head as well as their Father, God in Scripture is called the God and Fa∣ther of our Lord Iesus Christ,2 Cor. 11.31. and theEph. 1.17. God and1 Cor. 11.3. head of Je∣sus (i.e. believers) so ourGal. 1.4. Col. 2.2. God and Father, and Jesus Christ called him hisJoh. 20.17. Rev. 3.12. God, as well as his Fa∣ther, and the Apostle writes to the Hebrewes (who were believers) that their God was aHeb. 12.29. consu∣ming fire, So that believers are to looke upon God, as he is in his infi∣nite, holy, and glorious Majesty, and Being, as well as he is in his grace, love, and mercy to them
through Jesus Christ; Yet let not this knowledge be rested in (not thought to be perfectly attained to) for (as Luther said) it is not only a horrible but a damnable thing,The Angels and Saints doe often stile God THE LORD GOD AL∣MIGH TY. Rev. 4.8. & 11.17. & 15.32. & 16.14. & 19.15 & 21.22. The Law is called the strength of sin, because sin had no power to condemnt a man, if it were not for the law. to thinke of God without Jesus Christ. Secondly, The Law is usefull un∣to believers, to make them more prize, and praise the wonderfull, free, and rich love and graee of Ie∣sus Christ to them. This use Paul made of it, when he look'd upon the Law as the strength of sinne, he cries out with a joyfull acclamation. Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through Iesus Christ our Lord. 1 Cor. 15, 56, 57. Thridly, the third use (that be∣lievers may make) of the Law is to be a Discoverer, and Convincer of sinne unto themselves. As the Apo∣stle saith to believes.Jam. 2.9.11. If ye have respect to persons ye commit sinne, and are convinced of the Law. againe saith he, If thou kill, thou art ateansgressor of the Law. Yea doubtlesse, the words of Paul,Rom. 7.7. I
had not knowne sinne except the Commandement had said thou shalt not covet, doe declare that he had discoveries and convictions of sin by the Law, after his first believing, and that is the most proper, and ge∣nuine scope, and meaning of that text; for Paul there vindicates the Law, and the use of it. Also the experiences of the Saints teach this to be true; for seldome doe the Saints commit sinne, (especially, if it be an outward sinne) but the Commande∣ment which they broke, and against which they then sinned, represents it selfe to them, to reprove them for the sinne. Object.Object. But doe not you hereby put believers againe under the Law; for if the Law hath power to convince them, hath it not then the force of a Covenant of works upon them. Answ. Oh no,Answ. I am very farre from bringing believers that are once (rightly, judiciarily and upon good grounds) delivered from the Law,
under the power of it againe, neither doth this at all bring a believer under the Law againe: for note that the Law hath an enlightning and in∣forming part, and an accusing and condemning part. And herein the Law is like a candle, that a man may have light to see poyson in his chamber; yet he need not burne his chamber with the candle. A beleever may let the Law be his Informer, but not his Iudge. Fourthly, the Law teacheth be∣lievers to have no confidence in the flesh,Gal. 2.19. for it is a curse to the pride and presumption of believers, as well as of unbelievers. And therefore doth the Apostle experimentally say. I through thei.e. The Law of Moses, or it may be understood of the law of Christ law am dead to the Law, that I might live to God. That is, the law breaks off my hope, and takes away my confidence of be∣ing justified or saved thereby. As it was the people of Israell, so it is with many now (yea true believers) that they thinke themselvesExod. 19 8. holy till the Law appeares to them.
Obj. You make the Law as large to believers as to unbelievers,Object and you shew of what uses the Law are to believers; but under what o∣ther notions and considerations are believers to looke upon the Law. Answ. 1.Answ. They are to look upon it as the Law of Christ?Gal. 6.2. Beare ye one anothers burden, (saith the Apostle) and so fulfill the Law of Christ, by the Law of Christ in this place is meant the same with that in the thir∣teenth of the Romans the ninth vers. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe. Object.Object. But how are believers to consider it as the Law of Christ? Answ. 1.Answ. Rom. 13.9. Although indeed the Gospell is more pro∣perly the Law of Christ. Esa. 42.4. As it is instituted by Christ, as he is King, Iohn 13.34. therefore called the royall law. 2. As its explained and expounded by Christ, as he is Prophet, and a new Command, and doe not look upon it, as it was first handed out, and delivered by Moses. 3. As it is fulfill'd and satisfied by Christ as he is Priest, and so laid up
in the Arke Christ. Heb. 9.4. Secondly, Believers are to looke upon the Law, as contracted, and epitomized, and so instead of ten commandements to looke upon them as two, yea one, and comprehend∣ed in that one word love, as the A∣postle saithRom. 13.10. Love is the fulfilling of the Law: and in anotherGal. 5.14. place, the Law is fulfilled in one word. Thirdly, Beleevers are to looke upon the Law as weake and imper∣fect to help them, now they are sin∣ners. For what the LawRom. 8.3. could not doe, in that it was weak through the flesh, and againe, the ApostleHeb. 7.19. saith the Law made nothing perfect. And this was typed out in Moses, who could not, nor did not bring Moses to Canaan. Fourthly, Beleevers are to looke upon the Law, as written in rheir hearrs,Esa. 51.7. Hearken unto me (saith God) ye that know righteous∣nesse, the people in whose heart is my Law. And God promises, fay∣ing
Heb. 8.10. I will put my Law into their mindes, and write them in their hearts. Object.Object. But are not believers to looke upon the Law in the Letter, and written in the Bible? Ans. Yes doubtlesse,Answ. they are to goe to the Law, and to the Testimo∣ny, and to observe what is written,Esa.. and to have an high and honourable esteeme of the Scriptures: And to say as PaulRom. 4.3. said, What saith the Scriptures? It was the practise ofJoh. 7.38. Mat. 21.42. Christ and his1 Tim. 5.18, & 2.3.16. Jam. 4.5. Object. Apostles, when they did affirme any thing to prove it by Scripture. Object. But if the Law be writ∣ten upon the tables of the heart, a man need not at all looke upon the Letter without. Answ. Though Christ was the Law-giver,Answ. and had all the Law of God written within him, yet he look∣ed upon the letter of the word, and did make use of that as a weapon a∣gainst Satan, in that great combat ofMat. 4.4.7. temptation: and shall not wee
that have the Law but imperfectly written in our hearts, neglect the let∣ter, and wherefore was the word written? Was it not for ourRom. 15.4. learning? Let us therfore as David (or rather Christ personated, and prophecied by him) sayPsal. 40.8. thy word is within my heart, and yet make his outward word ourPs. 119.24. Object. Counsel∣lours as he did. Obj. But the Apostle Peter saith that they did well to looke unto the word of Prophecie, (or the Scrip∣tures) untill the day dawne, and the Day-starre did arise in their hearts but no longer. Answ. He doth not say,Answ. and no longer, and the word VNTILL is often taken in Scripture (for the space of time how long soever) for ever. See 2 Sam. 6.23. Psal. 110. 1. Heb. 10.16. Obj. But how would you have believers looke upon the Law in their hearts and also upon the writ.Object. ten and verball Law. Answ. The Law of love written
in the hearts of believers is the prin∣ciple ground, motive, and agent that puts them a doing: (as the Apo∣stle said,2 Cor. 5.14. See Joh. 14.23.24. the love of Christ eon∣straineth us) yet the outward letter is a good book in the hand of the Spi∣rit, to teach and guide believers what to doe and how to doe. Fifthly, Believers are to look up∣on the Law, and the righteousnesse thereof fulfilled by them, (or in them) as the Apostle testifies,Rom. 10.4. That the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. And another Apostle saith1 Joh. 3.22. , We keep his Commandements, and doe those things that are pleasing in his sight. So it is said (of those Saints that did not submit to Antichrist)Rev. 14.12. that they kept the commande∣ments of God. Sixthly,That the law cannot judge them, neither ought they to judge it. Believers are to looke upon the Law as dead to them, and they to it, (as Paul said of the world,Gal. 6.14. I am crucified to the world, and the world to me. So may a
believer say, I am dead to the law, and the law to me. Object.Object. But how doe believers keep the Commandements, or the law?Answ. Answ. They keepe it in their headRom. 8.4. & 10.4. Jesus Christ; for what he did or does as Mediator, it is reckoned and accounted to believers as well as their sins were reckoned, and imputed unto him: in this sence believers are to looke upon the law, as if it had ne∣ver been broken, but performed by them in every tittle. Secondly, believers keep the law when they live in love towards God and men; forRom. 13.10. love is the fnl∣filling of the law. And the more any abound and grow in love, the more actually and personally they doe performe the Law.1 Tim. 1.5. For the end of the Commandement is love out of a pure heart, &c. Thirdly, believers doe keep the law, in that they doe not transgresse the law willingly, but as PaulRom. 7.19. said, the evill which I would not,
that I doe, The will is the great tune∣wheele of the soule, and makes a thing in a manner good or evill, for where the will is wanting in a good duty, that duty is not rightly per∣formed, nor cannot be accepted: againe, where the will is present the Lord accepts that, the power be want∣ing. 2 Cor. 8.12. Object.Object. But doe any keepe the law perfectly in their owne per∣sons? Answ. No doubtlesse,Answ. for in ma∣ny things we offend all: and if we say we have no sinne we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. Jam. 3.2. 1 Joh. 1.10. Quest. How and in what sences are believers said to be dead to the law, free from the law, as the Scriptures speake, Gal. 2.19. Rom. Rom. 8.2. Answ. Two wayes, and in two sences, either in respect of the Autho∣rity, or else in respect of the Mosai∣call administration of it. Quest. How in respect of the
authority of it are they dead to it, and freed from it.How. belie∣vers are dead to the law, and free from the law. Answ. Fist, As it is a Iudge, the law hath no power to condemne them, for what the lawRom. 3.19. Certaiainly the law can say nothing in way of threatning, or curse to a believer. saith, it saith to them that are under the law. And a believer being justified cannot be againe condemned, for the Apostle concludes that strongly in the eighth to the Romans the first verse. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus. Therefore certainly the curses, and maledicti∣ons of the law, are ro more to be∣lievers then penall-statutes unto per∣sons that are fully acquitted, and dis∣charged by a legall tryall. Secondly, believers are dead to the law, and free from the law as it is an Accuser. The law hath the proper∣ty of an Accuser; For Christ told the Jews.Joh. 5.45. There is one that will accuse you, even Moses, in whom you trust: That is the law of Moses on which they did rest and de∣pendRom. 8.33. . But this law hath no pow∣er to accuse those that believe, there∣fore
doth the Apostle challenge all at once saying, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? you know it is the office of an Accuser to bring in a charge, so its the office of the law to charge those that are un∣der it. Object.Object. But are not believers sometimes charged and accused by the Law? Answ. Yes,Answ. the law doth some∣times (especially upon the breaking of it) accuse men, if they will listen to it: but it is such an accusation as was against Christ, and against Paul, that could not be proved. Now be∣lievers have anRom. 2.15. excusation, as well as an accusation,1 Joh. 5.10. and a wit∣nesse within them, to justifie them from this accusation: and when the law doth this ill office in the Consci∣ence, then appeale from the Court of Conscience to the Court of Christ, and plead that Act of indemnity (viz. the Covenant of grace) and the com∣position of Christ, which he hath paid for you, and you shall have a
discharge from the law, and the law shall have a charge to sequester your peace, and comfort no more. Thirdly, Believers are dead to the law, and free from the law, as it is a Lord; for believers are not under tenants, holding their spirituall and eternall estate by a lease from the law, as a substitute of Christ; Christ is the soules immediate Landlord, (or rather Soule lord) And though the law may be Christs Solicitor, and Steward: yet it is not authorised by Christ to raigne and rule in the con∣sciences of his people, for his Fa∣thersCol. 3.15. peace,Rom. 14.17. owne righte∣ousnesse, and his spirits joy is to dwell and rule in their hearts and con∣sciences. Fourthly, Believers are dead to the law, and freed from it as it is a King, that can pardon such as offend a∣gainst it. Now marke this, belie∣vers have nothing to doe, to sue, or to seeke for pardon from the law, neither can the law or will the law pardon any transgression whatsoever.
Fifthly, Believers are dead to, and free from the law as it is a Hus∣band. The law hath no longer do∣minion over a man then he liveth, (viz.) in the state of nature, and out of Christ) Nay, as in marriage, if either party be dead, whether the man or the woman, yet the nuptiall knot is broken, and the marriage tye and engagement is quite (and for ever) dissolved. And this is the do∣ctrine, and comparison of the Apo∣stle, in the 7th. of the Romans,Rom. 7.1. to the 7. the six first verses. Consider this seri∣ously, that if you be believers, and married to Christ, the law hath no more power over you, then a dead husband hath over his relict and live∣ing wife. Object. That is true,Object. the law hath no correcting power, but yet sure it hath a commanding pow∣er. Answ. Not so; for then the com∣parison would not hold, for Hus∣bands have no power to correct their wives at all: therefore of necessity it
must be understood of a command∣ing, and controuling power, which the law hath not over a believer. Object.Object. Nay if you say, that the law hath no commanding power o∣ver a believer, you fling the law out of doores, and give believers scope enough to doe what they list; for I am sure if there be no law, we shall quickly fec men take their full scope in sin. Answ.Answ. Though the law should be dead to a believer, and a believer dead to the law: yet it doth thence follow, that they should sin, must sin, or will sinne; no more then it followes that a woman must needs be a Harlot, because her Husband is dead. Marke this, that though the law (the former husband) be dead to a believer, yet a believer is no widdow (much lesse a Harlot) for he is married to Christ, and is under theGal. 6.2. law of Christ, which is love (as I shewed before) and1 Cor. 9.21. un∣der the law to Christ. Observe how the Apostle argues-from believers be∣ing
dead to the law, he saith not I am dead to the law, that I might live to sinne; but I am dead to the law that I might live to God. And in an∣other place he propounds a questi∣on in detestation to sinne, (having said before they were not under the law but under grace) what then saith he; (or what's the issue of this doctrine, that men are freed from the law)Rom. 6.15. Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. What shall a woman be more dutifull and obedi∣ent to an imperious husband, that did controule, and correct every day, then to another kinde, and loving Husband, that loves her as his owne flesh, and tenders her as his owne life. This is the true state of a believer that hath been formerly married to the law (which since is dead) and is now married to Christ. A true believer will be so farre from abusing this blessed and happy free∣dome, that nothing will engage him more to be holy then this. Thus ha∣ving
demonstrated how believers are freed from the authority, and So∣veraignty of the law, now it followes to shew how they are dead to, and free from, the Mosaical administration of it. Quest. Wherein did the Mosai∣call administration of the law con∣sist, from which believers are freed? Answ. 1. In the fiery and ter∣rible delivery of it,Deut. 33.2. and therefore called a fiery law (or in hebrew a fire of law) The delivering of the law upon Mount Sinai, and the de∣livering of it upon Mount Zion doe much differ. For upon Mount Sinai it was to the people as the1 King. 19 22, 23. voyce of thundring was to Elia. The sight and noise was so terrible that Moses (though a Mediator)Heb. 12.21. said, I exeeedingly feare and quake. But the law as it is now de∣livered, and administred unto us by Jesus Christ on Mount Zion, is
with such calmenesse, sweetnesse, and melodiousnesse, that it hath rather an affecting, and attract∣ing, then a terrifying property and effect; And it was propheci'd of Christ;Esa. 42.2. That he should not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voyce to be heard in the streets, and its said that the Iles should wait for his law. Though Christ doth give his law through fire, yet it is through the fire of his spirit, and it is with that love, and meeknesse, that they that heare it doe sing, and not cry, and they doe not say as the Israe∣lites, let not the Lord speake unto us, but they desire rather that the Lord would speak unto them. Secondly, the Mosaicall admini∣stration was rather an apposition and hinderance unto men, then any way a furtherance. As the Apostle calls the law, theCol. 2.14. hand-writing of ordinances which was against us. And the law in this place is granted by many to (and doubtlesse doth) comprehend the morall law as well as the ceremoniall.
Obj.Object. But how was that admini∣stration of the Law against them that were under it? Answ. It was accompanyed with so many carnall, and outward or∣dinances, that it was as a yoke,Acts 15.10.28. and burden (as it is called) unto the poore believers and disciples that were under it: for they were to doe so much duty, and to goe so farre (viz.) three times a yeare to Ierusalem, from all the parts of Iudca, and they were to be at such charges also, that all these things being put toge∣ther, that Church might well be said to be inGal. 4.25. bondage, with her chil∣dren. Thirdly, that administration was but a literall administration, or the administration of the letter; but this administration that we are speaking of is a spirituall administra∣tion: then the law was2 Cor. 3.3. writ∣ten in stones, but now in the flesh∣ly tables of the heart.
Object.Object. But here you speake of the difference between the admi∣nistration of the Law, and the ad∣ministration of the Gospell, and not of the difference betweene the two administrations of the law, the one before Christ, and the other since. Answ.Answ. Note this well, that all the law, and all the Gospell which they had before Christ, it was considered as one and the same administration: and so all the Gospell, and all the law which we have since Christ is but one administration. Therefore be cleare and sure in this that the whole administration of the Jewes isHeb. 8.6. Zac. 8. & 9.8. abrogated and null'd, and we Gen∣tiles have nothing to doe with that administration: but we are to receive both Gospell and Law at the hands of Christ, and to learne to know the administration we are under, and not to serve the Lord as the Iewes did in feare, and in the oldnesse of the letter; butLuk. 74. without feare,
(I meane a legall feare) and inRom. 7.4. newnesse of Spirit, and in this sence is the Law called a new Com∣mandement, because it had a new administration. For note that Christ did with the Law, and old Testament as a Gold-smith doth with old coyne (that wants in goodnesse of mettle, and weight,) he casts into the fire, and among much more pre∣cious mettle doth cast it, and stampt it anew with this impression; THE NEW COMMANDEMENT AND LAW OF CHRIST. Quest. What is the difference (or are the differences) between the Law and the Gospell? Answ.Gods dif∣ferent ends in giving the law and Gos∣pell. First, they differ in the ends of their institution; for God did never intend that the two Covenants should be for the same end. Object.Object. No; did he not intend his owne glory in both? Answ.Answ. Though God had that ge∣nerall end (viz. his owne glory) in giving both Covenants,1. In re∣spect of God. yet two particulars it did much differ. First,
First, In respect of God himself. For in giving the Law, he had in I more speciall manner, a regard to his owne Power, and Justice; but in giving the Gospel, he had re∣gard to his owne free grace, mercy, and goodnesse: And he instituted his Law for the exaltation of the one; and his Gospel for the advance∣ment of the other. 2. In respect of men,2. In respect of men. God did intend the Law, and Gospel, for different ends: for he never inten∣ded, by giving the Law, that any should be justified, or saved there∣by, (as I shewed before;) but in giving the Gospel, Gods maine end (with relation to men) was, that they should haveJohn 20.31. Life. Secondly. The Law, and Gospel, doe differ in their righteousnesse, and conditions: For the righteous∣nesse of the Law saith thus,Rom. 10.5. He that doth these things, shall live in them. But the righteousnesse of the Gospel (called the righteousnesse of faith) saith on this manner,
vers. 11. Whosoever beleeveth on him, (i. e. Christ) shall not be ashamed, or confounded. Here you see plain∣ly, that the Law requires mans own righteousness; but the Gospel re∣veales and requires Christs righte∣ousness, as it's Written,Rom. 1.17. There (i.e. in the Gospel) is the righte∣ousnesse of God, revealed from faith to faith. The Law requires doing, and that by a mans selfe, as a con∣dition of Salvation; but the Gos∣pel requires beleeving in Christ. Object. But did you not say be∣fore, that the Law was not given with an intention that any should be saved thereby, and yet now you make doing a condition of salvati∣on, as if men might be saved by doing? Answ.See pag. 106. I say againe, that God did never intend that men should be saved by the Law, or by their owne doings; but yet, whosoever will attempt that way, and put himselfe to be saved under that Covenant, he must performe the
condition thereof, which is doing. But it is impossible that the Law should give life, (it being not in∣stituted for that end) and it is as impossible that men should work and performe the conditions of the Law. Thirdly. They differ in their Mediators; forLev. 26.46. Deut 5.26, 27. Moses was the Mediator (at least typically) of the Law, butHeb. 8.6. & 9.15. & 12.24. Christ is the Me∣diator of the Gospel. Fourthly. They differ much in their promises; for all the promi∣ses of the Law are conditionall, or temporall: but the promises of the Gospel areHeb. 8.6. farre better, being for most part (if not all, in a sense) free, as also spiritual and eternall. Fourthly. They differ in their Ordinances: For the legall Ordi∣nances are calledHeb. 9.10 carnall, (i.e. more outward, and lesse spirituall) but the Gospel-ordinances are cal∣ledRom. 15.27. spirituall things. Fifthly. They differ in their
confirming Seales: For the Law was sealed and confirmed to the Jewes, by theHeb. 9.13.18, 19. bloud of beasts (as of Buls, Heifers, Goats, &c.) But the Gospel, or new Covenant, is sealed and confirmed by theMat. 26.28. bloud of Jesus Christ. I might instance in other seales, but I come to the sixth difference: Seventhly. They differ in this, that the Spirit is not given by the Law, but by the Gospel; as the Apostle interrogatorily argues.Gal. 3.2. Received ye (saith he) the spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hea∣ring ofi. e. The doctrine of faith, Gal. 1.22. faith? Object. What doe you meane, that the spirit was not at all given under the Law? Answ. No, I mean not so; (for the Spirit was given to1 Pet. 1.11. holy men of God, under the Law, though not in the like measure as since Christs Ascension) but I meane, that it is not the Doctrine, or preaching of the Law, that is the outward meanes to convey the
Spirit unto men, but the doctrine and preaching of the Gospel. Eigthly. They differ in their Light, Lustre, and Glory. The ho∣ly GhostHeb. 9.8. signifies, that the way into the holiest of all, was not yet made manifest, while as the first Tabernacle (or Covenant) was standing. On the other side, the same Spirit2 Tim. 1.10. testifies, that life and immortality came to light by the Gospel. And concerning the Lustre of the Gospel, it is said, to2 Cor. 4.4.6. shine. And for the Law, (though it was glorious) yet it had2 Cor. 3.9.10. no glory in this respect, (saith the Apostle) by reason of the glory that excelleth, which was the glory of the Gospel. Ninthly. They differ in the pro∣mulgation, and manifestation of both: For the Gospel hath two speciall priviledges and pre-emi∣nences of the Law, in the promulga∣tion of it. 1. That it is to be preached, chief∣ly, & mainly; (but the Law, acciden∣tally,
and occasionally) This is the Commission, and Message of Christ,Mark. 16.15. Luk. 9.2. Luk. 9.6. Goe and preach the Gospel: and it was theActs 5.42. and 7 3. and 8.25. Rom. 15.9. practice of Christs Apostles, to preach the Gospel altogether. Insomuch, that Paul1 Cor. 2.2. saith, that he determi∣ned to know (or make known) nothing among the Corinthians, save Jesus Christ, and him cru∣cified. And the reason why Mini∣sters were, and are called2 Cor. 3.6. the Ministers of the New Testament, and2 Cor. 1.15.23 Ministers of Christ, and of righteousnesse; because they did preach the New Testa∣ment, and did teach Jesus Christ, and his righteousnesse. The Gospel hath this pree∣minence of the Law, in the pro∣mulgation of it, in that it is to be preached in time, and in order, be∣fore the Law. Object. But how doth it ap∣peare, that the Gospel is to be preached before the Law?
Answ. 1. By the practice of Christ, and his Apostles, who preached the Gospel first. As for example, our Saviour he pronouncedMat. 5.3. to 12. See Mat. 4.23. Mat. 1.4. nine blessings of the Gospel (in his Sermon on the Mount) be∣fore he spake one word of the Law. So Paul1 Cor. 15.3. when he came to the Corinthians, he delivered unto them, first of all (that which he also received) how that Jesus Christ dy∣ed for their sinnes, according to the Scriptures; which was plaine and pure Gospel. So Paul and Silas upon the first question, propounded unto them by the Keeper of the Prison, they exhortActs 16.31. and teach him to beleeve in the Lord Jesus. And this was also the constant practice of the Apostles where∣ever they came.Gredere, fa∣cere. 2. Because that beleeving is to be taught before doing, forHeb. 11 6. without faith, it is impossible to please God. And that the preaching of the Law, doth not teach men to beleeve (i. e. in Christ as a Mediator)
I have shewed before;Perkins on Gal. 3.11. See Gall. 2.20. for (as that worthy man Mr. Perkins saith The Gospel requires faith in Christ, the Mediator God-Man, and this faith the Law never knew. 3. Because that the Gospel is the word that doth inlighten and beget men againe, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. 2 Tim. 1.10. 1 Cor. 4.15. And to what end is it to teach any thing of duty unto men, before they have either light, or life, to perform the same? Observe what, and how our Saviour spake to the sinfull woman, thy sinnes are forgiven, therefore sinne no more; here was more Gospel then Law. Many more reasons might be given: but to an∣swer some Objections, that are brought against this truth. Object. But the Lord taught Adam and Eve, in Paradice, the Law, before he did deliver the Promise unto them Gen. 3.11, 13.16. Ergo, the Law should be preach'd before the Gospel.
Answ. For God to ask Adam, hast thou eaten of the tree? &c. and Eve, What is this that thou hast done? is not at all to preach the Law; Withall, before he threa∣tens Adam, or Eve for their diso∣bedience, he declares the promise of Christ, see v. 15, 16, 17. But put the case, this had been a preach∣ing of the Law to them; yet this was an extraordinary manner of speaking, and not an ordinary way, and therefore the Argument is not good; for by the same reason, we may say, that the Gospel must now be accompanied with miracles, be∣cause Christs preaching, and his Apostles was so. 2. Object. You say, the Apo∣stles preached the Gospel first; but it is evident to the contrary, for they discovered unto men their sins (as Peter said, Acts 2. Ye have cru∣cified the Lord of Glory.) Answ. 1. I have proved before, that the Apostles did preach the Gospel before the Law, and it is
evident, that Peter, in that second of the Acts (before he spake of the Jewes crucifying Christ) did preach the free and blessed Gospel: as concerning the powring out of the Spirit, v. 17. and being saved by calling upon the name of the Lord, v. 21. And those words of Peter, spoken to the Jewes, v. 36. which you have crucified; were not cheifly intended by him, to declare to them their sin: but his aime and scope, was to prove that, that Jesus, whom they had crucified, was risen from the dead, and was both Lord and Christ. For mark the text, Let all the house of Israel, saith he, know assuredly, that God made that same Jesus, both Lord and Christ. But what if it were gran∣ted, that this was Law; yet what is this, one occasionall word in a whole Sermon, is no ground to preach whole Sermons, yea, many Sermons of the Law, to fit men for Christ, as too many doe.
Object. But how can men come to see the want and need of Christ, if the Law be not first preach∣ed unto them? Answ. The Scripture doth not command Ministers to shew men the need of Christ first, but rather to shew the love of God, in giving Christ; and to shew and set forth theJohn 3.1. Rom. 5.9. riches of Christs grace to sinners in generall; and it is supposed, that all men doe looke upon themselves as sinners, and acknowledge them∣selves to be sinners, although they have not such a particular and sensible conviction there∣of. Object. But doth not Christ say, that the whole need not the Physitian, but they that are sick, importing, that they must first know their sins, and be sick with the sence thereof. Answ. I have, in a printed Sermon, elsewhere answered that Objection, and cleared that and
such Scriptures, yet observe this, that our Saviour doth not intend there,So that bles∣sed Gospel Preacher Mr. Bridges expounds the place. sinners that did see them∣selves lost, but those that were so; also the gentile Sinners, with the Jewes, so called, and accounted. Object. But is it not the first worke of the Spirit, to convince men of sin, John 16.8? Answ. by sinne, in that place, is meant, the sinne of unbeliefe, as our Saviour expounds it; of sinne, (saith he) because they beleeved not on me, v. 9. and this sinne is not convinced by the Law, as I have before declared. For that which doth not command faith, cannot discover that sin which is contrary to it, even unbeliefe. Object. But repentance is the doctrine of the Law, and this was the first thing that was taught by the Apostles, and is also mentioned as the first principle, or first thing to be taught. Answ. Though repentance be sometimes placed before beleeving,
and set down as the first principle, in Heb. 6. Yet understand what this word repentance signifies: this word in the Greek, signifies, as much, as alter, or change your mindes, and being spoken to the Iewes, doubtlesse, is meant as much as this, have other thoughts of Christ, then you have, and beleeve his Gospel, and doe no more con∣ceive of him, as you have done, as not to be the true Christ. And Mr. Perkins, on Gal. 3.11. (in answer to an Objection) saith, Indeed the Law doth not teach true repentance, neither is it any cause of it, but onely anoccasion: the Gospel only prescribes repen∣tance, and the practice thereof. And when the Apostle cals it a principle, yet he also there cals it a principle of the doctrine of Christ, including it in the Gospel, and doubtlesse a meere legall repen∣tance, is no way available to salva∣tion.
Object. If the Law be not to be preached first, when, and to whom is the Law to be preached? Answ. 1. The Law is to be preached, after the Gospel, and unto justiciaries, or such as doe justifie themselves, (as the Jewes did) and that thinke (by misun∣derstanding the Law) that they keep the Law, and worke the righteousnesse that the Law re∣quireth. Thus Christ did preach the Law, Matth. 5. And thus the Law, in the perfection, and strict demands and conditions of it, is to be preached. 2. The Law is to be preached when men would absolutely destroy it, and to those that would make it null, and of none effect: As our Saviour said to the Jewes, Thinke not thatMat. 5.17 I am come to destroy the Law. And as Paul satisfied the Romans, (that thought he intended, by the doctrine of Justification to destroy the Law) saying; Doe we thenRom. 3.31. make
void the Law by Faith? God for∣bid: Yea, we doe establish the Law. 3. The Law is to be preach∣ed, and taught unto men, after they doe beleeve in the mandato∣ry part of it, or so farre as it doth teach beleevers their duties towards God, and Christ; and thus the Apostles in their Epi∣stles did commonly make use of it. But observe; 1. That the threatnings, and cur∣ses of the Law, are not to be taught at all unto beleevers, for they doe not concerne them: neither are the curses of the Law to take place upon beleevers, or against them at all, so as to enthrall, or enslave them againe in bondage; for in this sence I shewed before, that beleevers were not under the Law. 2. The Promises of the Law, are not to be at all preached to beleevers, so as to put them upon expectation of living, and being sa∣ved
thereby; for that is granted, and pass'd before through grace, up∣on the account of Jesus Christ. 3. The duties, and commands of the Law, are not to be urged upon any other ground, then upon that ground which Christ himselfe did urge them, which was this;John 14.1 5. If ye love me, keep my commande∣ments. Thus having cleared and ended the second part of this Treatise, which treates of the Law; now I come to the third and last part, which treats of the Promises.
THE Third PART of this BOOK, Treats upon the Promises which be∣long to the two Covenants. Quest. WHat did Beleevers ob∣taine, and do you desire to obtaine? Answ. The fulfilling and inheriting of Gods Promises, Heb. 11.33. & 6.12. Q. What doe you mean by Gods pro∣mises? A. All the free and conditionall Ingagements of God the Father to Christ, or of God and Christ to men, which are written in the
Scriptures, and distinct from Com∣mands, and Threatnings. Q. Is the word promise alwayes ta∣ken in Scripture in that sence? A. No; Sometimes it is taken for the performance of the promise, or for the thing promised, Luk. 24.49. Act. 1.4. Heb. 10.36. and 11.39. Q What are you to learne and to ob∣serve concerning the Promises that you may obtaine them, and partake of them? A. Six things. Q What are they? A. 1 Such Rules as are in the Scriptures for the right and di∣stinct understanding of them. 2 To whom they do belong, and with whom they are made. 3 Why the promises are made and performed. 4 How they are (and may be) divided. 5 How to apply them rightly; And, 6 How to finde suitable pro∣mises (both direct and indirect pro∣mises) readily.
The first thing, namely, the Rules to understand the Promises. Q. WHat are those Rules that you are to observe for the right understanding of the Promises? A. 1 That all the promises of God are in themselves true, faithfull,Yea, i.e. true. Amen, i.e. faithfull. and precious, and in Christ (or through him) fulfilled, and perfor∣med, 2 Cor. 1.20. 2 Pet. 1.4. 2 That a Promise is put for Pro∣mises, and so on the contrary, Gal. 3. 16, 18, 19, 29. compared toge∣ther. 3 That the Promises were spoken and uttered, some by (a) God the Father, someby (b) Jesus Christ, some byJudg. 13.3. & 18.22 Mat. 1.20. Luke 1.13 20. Gen. 16 10.12. Angels, & some by (c) men (guided in a special maner therunto by the holy Spirit) (a) Esa. 42.1, 2, 3. Joel 2.28. with Act. 1.4. (b) Prov. 1.23. Mat. 11.28, 29. Joh. 6.27. Lu. 1.13. to 20. (c) Lam. 3.25. and 3.32, 33.
4 That some Promises are Prophe∣sies, as well as Promises. As for ex∣ample, Gen. 48.19. and 49.10. Num. 24.7. and 18.15.33.27. Esa. 2.2, 3, 4, and 7.14. Psal 66.4. and 72.2. to 18 and 146.10. Esa. 40.4, 5. Luke 1.67.76. Deut. 33.12.38. 5 That some Promises are of the nature of Commands, and may bee taken for Commands as well as for Promises, as Deut. 12.7.12.18. and 13.11. and 16.15. Judg. 13.5. 1 Sam. 9 16. 2 King. 17.39. Prov. 4.21. Mat. 22.19. 6 Many Scriptures that are as Promises to the godly, yet are Threatnings to the wicked, as Psal. 140.11. Esa. 17.4.17. and 24.13. Jer. 6.3. Ezek. 6.10. Amos 3.12. Nah. 2.13. Zeph. 2.9. Mal. 3.5. and 4.3. 7 Some Scriptures (which are accounted Promises) are rather con∣fident sayings, and experimentall expressions of the Saints upon seve∣rall occasions (yet true and pro∣ceeding from the Spirit of God in them) these are very many; See a
few for example, Josh. 23.10. Jud. 5.24. 1 Sam. 2.6. to 10. and 2.22, 3. Psal. 9.9. Eccles. 8.12. Esa. 17.11.13. and 26.12. Jer. 38.20. Mic. 7.8, 9. Nah. 1.7. Rom. 6.14. and 16.20. 1 Cor. 1.8. Phil. 1.6. Eph. 4.30. Rev. 15.4. 8 Some Promises are made to some concerning others, as Gen. 16 12, and 17.16. and 18.10. Num. 11.17. Judg. 12.5. and 13.3.5. 1 Sam. 9.16. 1 King. 21.29. 1 Chro. 17.12. and 22.9.10. Luke 1.13, 14, 15, 16. Act. 9.16. Rom 9.12. 9. Some Promises are purely le∣gall, and conditionall (such areSee Lu∣ther on Gal. 2.18. all the Promises of the Law) See Lev. 18.5. Ezek 18.21 and 20.11. Deut. 5.33. Luke 11.28. Rom. 10.5. 10 Some Promises are free, absolute, and without condition (and these are purely Evangelicall) as the Pro∣mises of giving Christ, of giving the Spirit, of giving a new heart, &c.) See Esa. 42.6. and 49.8. Joel 2.28. Ezek. 36.26. Jer. 32.40. Heb. 8.10, 11, 12.
11 Some Promises are partly free, and partly conditionall, as Esa. 55.1. Joh. 6.37. and 7.37.38. 12 Some Promises are free in one place, and conditionall in another, as Esa. 6.7. Heb 8.11. compared with Lev. 26.3.12. Jer. 24.7. with 7.23. 13. Some Promises in the Old Testament, are Commands virtually in the New Testament, as Esa. 42.7. and 49.6. with. Act. 13.46. 14 That Promises made in the Old Testament are cited in the New Testament (especially when they are fulfilled) as Esa. 43.3. with Luke 3.5. See Act. 2.39. and 3.26. and 7.37. and 13.38. and 15.15, 16 Rom 9.15.33. and 11.26. 1 Cor. 3.8. and 2.6.16.18. Gal. 3.8. 15 Some Promises are already perfectly fulfilled, as those concern∣ing the Incarnation, Death, and Re∣surrection of Christ, with many o∣thers. 16 Some Promises are fulfilled in part, but not wholly, as Esa. 2. Mich. 5. Heb. 8.
17 Some Promises are not yet fulfilled at all in any part, as the last calling of the Jewes, the com∣ming of Christ in the Clouds, the Resurrection, &c. 18 Some Promises are made one∣ly for a season, and the time limi∣ted and expressed for the fulfilling of them, Judg. 20.28. Esa. 17.7. and 19.24. Luke 23.43. 1 King. 17.14. and 2 King. 10.30. Esa. 38.5. 19 Some Promises that are maade with few, may belong to many, as Matth. 16.18, 19. with 18.18. and 19.28. and 28.20. 20 Some Promises may be made in generall, and yet not fulfilled to every man in particular, as Mar. 16.17, 18. Psal. 91.7. 21 Some Promises may be spoken in generall, concerning some in particular, as Mat. 16.28. Mark. 9.1. Rev. 17.16. 22 Some Promises are made upon extraordinary occasions, and in an extraordinary manner, as Num. 20.8. Act. 18.10.
23 Some Promises did relate to the type, and Antitype, or unto those men (as some Kings, Priests, and Prophets) and unto Christ himselfe, as 1 Chro. 17.14. and 22.10. Psal. 40.15.17. and 72.16, 17, 18. and 89.4, 5, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24. and 132 17. Luke 1.69. Esa. 22.22, 23, 24. 24 Some Promises doe belong un∣to Christ, and the godly, as Psal. 91.11, 12, 13, 16. Hag. 2.23. 25 Sometimes God and Christ speake in way of Promises concern∣ing themselves, and not to any, Esa. 18.4. and 33.10. and 42.8. and 43.13. and 45.7. and 55.13. and 66.19. Mat. 24.30. 26 Sometimes God maketh Pro∣mises concerning his Law, and con∣cerning the irrationall creatures, as Esa. 42.21. Matth. 10.29. Gen 8.21. 27 Some Promises are uttered before they are performed, as if they were already performed, Josh. 10.8. Esa. 21.9. Rev. 14.8. and 18.2.
28 Sometimes things that are done by God for his people (though not directly promised be∣fore) are noted as Promises, Esa. 25.4. and 44.22. and 54.9. 29 Some Promises are to be un∣derstood both litterally and spiri∣tually, as Numb. 21.8. Hag. 2.7, 9. Zach. 1.16. Mat. 9.13. Joel 2.32. with Rom. 10.13. Mar. 10.30. 30 Sometimes spirituall deducti∣ons and inferences drawn from na∣turall reasons, are noted for Pro∣mises, as Matth. 7.11. Luke 18.6, 7, 8. and 2.28. 31 Some Promises may be appli∣ed both to Jewes and Gentiles, as Esa. 19.23.24 25. and 25.7. and 32.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Esa. 35.10. and 42.7. and 44.3, 4, 5. and 49.9, 10, 11. and 51.3, 4, 5, 6.11. and 53.10, 11, 12. and 54.13. Mich. 4.1, 2, 3. Zach. 2.11. 32 Some Promises may be under∣stood of the double restauration of the Jewes, or of their Redemption out of the Captivity of Babylon, and their Redemption out of their
present Captivity, as Esa. 52.12. and 57.13, 14, 15, and 14.5, 6, 7, 8. Zach. 2.12. and 8.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13. 33 Some Promises are made by some men unto other men, as Ier. 38.24. 34 Sometimes generall Promi∣ses are applied in particular, as 1 Kings 8.37.40. with 2 Chron. 20.8.10. 35 Sometimes the same Promises that is particular in one place, is made generall in another place, as 2 Sam. 7.14. with Psal. 89.29, 32. 36 Sometimes one and the same Promise is applied in severall cases, as 1 Cor. 10.26, and 28. and Iosh. 1.5. compared with Heb, 13.5. that Pro∣mise which was made to Ioshua a∣gainst feare, is applied to the He∣brews against covetousnesse. 37 God doth oftentimes repeat and renew the same Promises. See Gen 12.3. and 22.18. and 26.4. and 28.14. 38. Some Promises are onely
typicall Promises (if I may so call them) or Promises made through the Type, yet with the relation to the Antitype, as to accept of mens offerings for to make atonement for them, and their sins, Lev. 1.4. Num. 15.25, 26, 28. 39 Some Promises are made by God unto particular men, as Exod. 3.12. Deut. 31.23. Ioel 1 5, 6, 7. Iudg. 6.16. and 20.28. 1 Sam. 9 9.16. and 10.6. 2 Sam. 7.12, 13. 1 King. 3.14. and 9.5. and 11.38. and 17.14. 2 King. 20.5, 6. and 22.20. 1 Chro. 28.6, 7. 2 Chron. 5.12. and 7.18. and 34.28. Esa. 38.5. Ier. 8.19. and 15.19, 20, 21. Luke 24 45. Ioh. 1.50. and 13.36. Act. 18.10. Matth. 10.19. Act. 1.8. Also to particular women, Gen. 16.10. Iudg. 13.3. Luke 1.31, 32, 33. 40 Sometimes God made Promi∣ses in answer to mens prayers. See Exod. 14.19, 20. Iudg. 20.28. 1 King. 9.3 and 2.20.5, 6. 41 Sometimes God gives Pro∣mises to men as reasons to move them to doe their duties, Deut. 14.2.
42 Some Promises are made by good men to God (and these are called Vowes) Psal. 66.13, 14. and 119.32.47, 57. Gen. 28.20, 21, 22. Judg. 11.30, 31. 43 Sometimes Promises are made by God, but applied by some men unto other men, Deut. 9.3. 44 In Gospell dayes, Afflictions, Tribulations, and Persecutions are in the nature of Promises unto the Saints. See Mark. 10.30. Matth. 5.11. Heb. 12.6. 45 As the Jewes under the Law had more temporall and fewer spirituall promises; so Beleevers un∣der the Gospel have more spiritual, and fewer temporall Promises. The second thing, viz. to whom the Promises do belong. Q. TO whom doe the Promises be∣long? A. Either unto Jesus Christ, or unto men. Q. What are those Promises that
do belong unto Jesus Christ? A. Among many others. His Father promised unto him, and concerning him. 1 That he should be a Saviour and Redeemer,Also Iesus Luk. 1.31 and the Son of God, v. 35. Hos. 1.7. Zach. 9.16. Matth. 1.21. Act. 5.31. and 13.23. 2 That his name should be cal∣led Immanuel (or God with us) Esay. 7.14.

(See Heb. 7.14.) 4 That he should be conceived of the Holy Ghost, and borne of a Virgin, Luke 1.31.35. Jer. 31.22. Esa. 7.14. 5 That the Spirit (i.e. the Spirit of God) should be upon him, Esa. 11.2, 3. See Luke 4.18.See Act. 3 22. Heb. 7.17. 6 That he should be Prophet, Priest, and King, Deut. 18.15.18. Psal. 110.4. and 89.27. 7 That he (i.e. God the Father) would strengthen and uphold him, (i.e. in the worke of Redemption)

Esa. 11.2. Psal, 2.9. and 89.23. and 110.1. 15 That he should reigne and execute justice on the earth, Ier. 23.6. and 33.15. Zach. 6.16. Mic. 4.7. Q. To what manner of men, or to what kinde of men do (or did) the Pro∣mises belong? A: To Jews and Gentiles. Q. Why doe you distinguish betweene the Iewes and Gentiles? A. Because that there were and are many Promses that were and are made to the Jews more proper∣ly and peculiarly, which did relate to them whilst they were a Church formerly, and will concerne them hereafter at their conversion. Q. What are the promises that God formerly made with the Iewes when they were a Church? A. 1 That he would bee their God and King, sometimes he speaks it conditionally, and sometimes absolutely, Ier. 7.23. and 11.4.24.7. Eze. 11.20. Hos. 13.10.

A. 1 For his owne glory (which is the highest and chiefest end of all his actions) Esa. 60.21. John 14.13. 2 Cor. 1.20. 2 For his owne names sake (viz.Christ is the maine cause of making & perform∣ing all the promises, and also the sub∣stance of them all, called the Covenant it self, Esa. 42.6 and 49.8. Christ, or his gracious Attributes) Esa. 43.25. and 48.9.11. Ezek. 39.25. Also because of his owne Sove∣reignty, Exod. 19.5. Rev. 17.14. as particularly his love, and loving kindnesse, Esa. 43.4.

zeale, 2 King. 19.31. his faithfulnesse, 1 Thess. 5.24. 3 Because they are adopted and married to him, 1 Sam. 12.22. Jer. 31.9. and 3.14.

Gen. 21.13. 7 Sometimes God is pleased to give this as a reason that his people do and performe somewhat, which hee counts worthinesse in them (though indeed none can plead worthinesse) Iosh. 6.17. 1 King. 21.29. Ier. 39.18. Rev. 3.4. 8 God is pleased to take occasion from their very sinnes to make and performe some promises to his peo∣ple. See Gen. 8.21. Esa. 57.18, 19. Hos. 2.13, 14.
Q. How are the promises to be appli∣ed, and to be made use of? A. First, Ʋnderstandingly, as the Apostle exhorted the Ephesians, not to be unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is, Eph. 5.17. Many may say of the promises, as Iob said, I uttered that I understood not, things too wonderfull for me, which I knew not, Job 42.3. The Disciples of ChristMar. 9.32 Luk. 18.32 were, and doubtlesse beleevers still are, ve∣ry ignorant in understanding the promises; therfore that you may ap∣ply the promises understandingly, consider these ensuing particulars: 1 Consider in what estate or condition you judge your selfe to be in, whether a sinner, and unbe∣leever, or a Saint, and beleever? If you judge your self to be a sinner, then you must apply your selfe to those promises that are suitable to sinners. As that Christ dyed for the un∣godly, and for sinners; And that Christ came into the world to save sinners, Ro. 5.6, 8.
Object. But my case is this, that I do not know whether I am an unbeleever, or a beleever. Ans. If it be so with you, then you must either put it to the worst, and suppose your self to be an unbe∣liever (and so begin the world again, as the Proverb is; I mean, go as a sin∣ner, to seek out Christ in some suit∣able promise as I mentioned before) or else you must looke to those pro∣mises made for assurance, and there is your most proper legacy, and through that door you must expect the Lord to come out to you. 2 You are to consider whether you come to the promises as one that hath no conditions, or as one that hath conditions. If you finde no conditions in you, then you must not goe to a conditionall pro∣mise; but if you finde the conditi∣ons in you, then are you to ad∣dresse your selfe to those promises that are suitable for you, and may relieve you therein. Object. I pray you cleare unto me
what you meane by having the conditions in me? Answ. I meane thus, that some soule may say, I am hungry and thirsty after Christ, and I am heavy and weary laden, and I would lay my burden upon Jesus Christ. Now such a soule hath the conditions and qualifications, that are mentio∣ned in some promises: As blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse, for they shall be filled. And the heavy and weary laden they shall finde rest to their soules, Matth. 5.6. and 11.28, 29. Object. But what if I have not those conditions in me, as to feel my selfe, hun∣gry, thirsty, and heavy laden? Answ. If you finde not these, or such conditions in you, then you are not to apply your selfe to those promises, that are made to such as have those conditions in them. But you are to seek out for other (and more suitable) promises, which are absolute, and without condition. Object. Are there any promises ab∣solute,
and without condition? Answ. Yes, I have shewed this before in one of the Rules concern∣ing the Promises. But to instance in a few; there is a promise of justi∣ficationEs. 43.25 I am be (saith God) that blotteth out thy transgressions for my owne names sake. So also in another place,Ez. 36.25 I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be cleane. So there is a promise of pouring out of the Spirit, God promiseth toJoel. 2.28 poure it out upon all flesh. Many more I might instance in, as of giving aEz. 36.26 new heart, and taking the stony heart out of their flesh. 3 Understand this that in many of the Promises men are considered passively, or such as can doe no∣thing till God doth work in them. As that in John, And they shall be taught of God.Joh. 6.45 Say you in this case as DavidPs. 119.49 said, Remember thy word (unto thy servant) in which thou hast caused me to hope. 4 Consider in applying, and using the promises, that where God
hath not excluded men, they ought not to exclude themselves; lest they sinne as much in refusing grace, as others do in abusing it. 5 In the application of the Pro∣mises, look not onely upon the words, but upon him that hath spoken them; and consider in God, 1 His Power that he can peform them, Heb. 11.19. Rom. 4.21. 2 His Faithfulnesse that he wil performe them, Heb. 10.23 and 11.11. 1 Thess. 5.24. and his oath, Luke 1.72.73. 3 His Remembrance of his Pro∣mise, He is ever mindfull of his Co∣venant, Psal. 111.5. See Esa. 49.15. 4 His Goodnesse that he will performe his word, though men should neglect their duty, and the condition on their part, Mich. 7.20. 2 Tim. 2.13. 6 That you may apply the Pro∣mises understandingly, consider that the whole Story of the New Testa∣ment is a bundle of Promises, and a
rich Treasury of Jewels, and a pre∣cious Mine opened to enrich, and store you with all manner of graces and blessings. Therefore if you can∣not remember a particular promise for every thing you would have, or want, yet take the honycombe (I meane the Gospel) into your hand, and you may fill your mouth with the honey that comes out thereof. I conceive that the ground of be∣leevers faith (especially fince Christ revealed in the flesh) is the history of the New Testament, and wee are not to hang our soules now, as they did before Christ came, upon one naile and pin, or upon one pro∣mise, but upon the great pillars of our Faith, viz. The death and Re∣surrection of Jesus Christ. And so to conclude our justification and salvation from the whole tenor of the Gospell and New Testament, as Paul did, Gal. 2.20. 1 Tim. 1.15. 7 In the right using of the pro∣mises, you are to looke upon theEph. 3.6. person of Christ, together with his
propitiation and intercession, as the cause, medium, or means, & that doth entitle you to, and give you an interest in, and a vertue and blessing from, and through the Promises, 2 Cor. 1.20. Joh. 1.16. Rom. 11.36. 8 You are not to rest upon the person of the Mediator Christ one∣ly, but you are to make the Father the object (or as some call him the ultimate object) of your faith and hope, and so by him (i.e. Christ) to be∣leeve in God, 1 Pet. 1.21. Object. Doe you meane that we should looke upon the Father as a remote object, or an object beyond Christ. Answ. No, you are not to looke upon God the Father as an object out of Christ, nor yet beyond Christ; but as a distinct object from Christ. As he said to his Disciples,Joh. 14.1 Ye beleeve in God, beleeve also in me; and as the Apostle speaks distinctly of repentance towards God, and faith to∣wards our Lord Jesus Christ: Looke upon the Father and Christ, as Stephen did, as being distinct, though
yet one. This mystery I rather ad∣mire, then undertake to reveale. Having cleared this first rule or meanes, for the applying of the Promises, I come to the second. Secondly, the Promises are to be applied orderly, for as God is the God of order, so he will have his children and people to act, and doe all orderly. For the orderly apply∣ing of the Promises consider: 1 That you are to apply every promise according to the intent of the Promiser, and according to the nature of the Promise, as the pro∣mise of Justification, when you looke to be justified; and the pro∣mise of Sanctification, when you seek sanctification. Many doe very improperly and impertinently urge the Promises of God. Would it not be improper for a condemned Malefactor to beg an estate, money, or cloaths of his Prince, before he had begged his life; so is it for a man to beg more holinesse and grate, before he begs pardon and forgive∣nesse.
Therefore in the first place look for Justification. 2 To apply the Promises orderly, is to apply the promises of grace, before the promises of glory. Men are not to look upon the promises of salvation, before they look upon the promises of Justification, adopti∣on, and Sanctification: For God saves none, nor will save none, but those that are first justified, sanctified, and adopted;This is as if a wo∣man should lay claime to a mans estate, be∣fore she is married to him. He first gives grace, and then glory, Psal. 84.11. Thirdly, the Promises are to bee applyed particularly; as Paul said, Christ loved me, and gave himselfe for me, and Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chiefe. The promises are alwayes to be particu∣larly, and singularly beleeved, asJoh. 11.26 Christ said to Martha, Beleevest thou this? And asAct. 8.37 Phillip spake to the Eunuch, If thou beleevest, &c. And the promises still run upon a particular application; asAct. 13.39 He that beleeveth is justified; and inJoh. 3.36 another place, He that beleeveth shall be saved.
Object. But the Promises are made in generall, and not in particular. Answ. Yet generall promises may and ought to1 King. 8.37.40 with 2 Chr. 20.8.10. be applyed in particular. Fourthly, the Promises are to be applied self-denyingly. There is no looking upon the conditions and terms of the Law, if we would look upon the Gospel, and the promises thereof: And when we apply to Christ, we must apply our selves to him asGal. 2.17 sinners; and if we looke towards his righteousnesse, we must look off our owne righteousnesse;Ro. 9.15 so that the soule must see nothing in selfe, nor done by selfe, to move God either to make, or performe his promises; but you must cry, Grace, Grace, is the ground of all. Fifthly, the Promises are to bee applyed strongly and undoubtingly,Esa. 7.9. for men can never be established unlesse they beleeve confidently: And of all duties, beleevers are most slow and backward to beleeve the pro∣mises; therefore doth Christ very
oftenMat. 14 31. & 17.20. Mar. 16 14. Lu. 24 25. Mat. 28 17. checke his Disciples for their doubting, and unbeleeving. And this is spoken in commenda∣tion of Abraham (the father of the faithfull) that heRo. 4.20. staggered not at the promise, but was strong in faith, gi∣ving glory to God. Object. But all the promises are not to be beleeved absolutely and confidently, for some of them are conditionall pro∣mises. Answ. 1 Its true, that many of the promises are conditionall; as the promises that belong to the well-being of Christians, which relate to their soules after they doe beleeve, and are made Christians. As for instance, The promise of Christs manifestation to the soule; and the promise of salvation, these two are speciall promises that re∣late to the soule, yet not to the be∣ing of Christians, but to their well-being; and the conditions of these are mentioned in those promises: As, If any man keep my Commandements (saith Christ)Joh. 14.2 I will love him,
and will manifest my selfe unto him; and be that beleeveth on me shall neverIoh. 3.16 & 10.28. perish, but have everlasting life. These are conditions of the manifestation of grace, and giving of glory; but not of the first working, and giving of grace, as I shewed before. 2 There be outward promises that concerne the bodies of men that are conditionall. As,Psal. 39.9 There is no want to them that feare the Lord. And1 Tim. 4.8. Godlinesse hath the promise of the life that now is. Now there bee none but those that feare God, and are godly, that can lay claim to these promises. Object. But when I see my selfe so vile and nought, and my heart so sinfull, how can I have that confidence in Gods promises? Answ. It is not any thing that you can finde in your selfe that is (or ought to be) the ground of your faith and hope; but you must say as the Prophet said, Though myPs. 31.10 strength faileth because of mine ini∣quity, and though myPs. 40.12 flesh, and my
heart, and myPs 143.7. spirit faileth,Psal. 119 81. yet I will hope in thy word. Learne in this case toRo. 4.18 hope (or beleeve as Abra∣ham did) against hope; and asHeb. 11.11 Sarah that considered not the deadnesse of her owne wembe, but rested up∣on the word of promise. And say as MaryLuk. 1.38 said, Be it unto me according to thy word. ForIoh. 20.29. blessed are they that have not seene, and yet have belee∣ved. Object. But God hath long promised, and I have a long time waited and ex∣pected, and yet he performes not his pro∣mise. Ans. Though some count God slackin performing his promises, yet he is sure, and his promisesConfirm∣ed by Gods oath Heb. 6.17. cer∣taine, andPsal. 77.8 never faile: There∣fore the children of Abraham, should be like their Father, and wait patiently, that they might obtaine the promise; as itsHeb. 11.15. said of him, After he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. Thus having shewed how the Promises are applied, I come now
to shew how they are divided. Q. How are the Promises divided? A. Severall wayes. Either, 1 Absolute, or Conditionall. 2 Evangelicall, or Legall. 3 Generall, or Particular. 4 Reall, or Personall. 5 Common, or Speciall. 6 Principall, or lesse prin∣cipall. 7 Direct, or by consequence. 8 Spirituall, temporall, or eternall, or promises for the life that now is, or that which is to come. 9 Informing, or Assuring. Q. How shall I find the Promises rea∣dily, and according to my occasions? A. Here followeth a vary ready way, for I have set them downe Alphabetically, or according to the Letters, beginning with A but note foure things further: 1 That I doe forbeare to put downe the words of the Promises, because you may search in Gods own Book for them.
2 I doe not begin with spiritu∣all promises, and then temporall, and eternall; but in regard this is onely for the finding of them, I have put them downe rather Al∣phabetically, and in a Concordan∣tial way. 3 I have put the informing Promises (or such Promises as doe give light, but doe not runne absolutely) upon the left side of the Page under the words Inform∣ing Promises, and the absolute Promises upon the right side of the Page, under the words Assu∣ring Promises. I was willing also to make a third Columne (or part) in the Page, to shew how the Saints did apply those Promises, but the narrownesse, and little∣nesse of the Leafe would not beare that. 4 Where there are double Pro∣mises, as Promises made of such a grace, and then to such a grace, therein I begin with the first, and put the word Of in the margent
on the left hand, and then the word To following, which you will quickly and easily discerne: And herein also I thought to be∣gin with absolute Promises, and those made with sinners at first, and then with conditionall Promises made to Saints, but this I thought would be a more dark and doubt∣full way.
