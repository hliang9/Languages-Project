ON THE CORONATION I. NO, 'tis in vain. What Limits can controul The Rovings of my active Soul? That Soul that scorns to be to Place confin'd, But leaves its dull Companion Earth behind; Whilst Fancy with unbounded flight, Enjoys that Object of Delight, Which envious distance would conceal from Sight: And coth by thought supply The weaker Prospect of the Eye, Giving Poets to partake (Like those Deities they make) Of Infinite Ubiquity. II. Thus methinks I see the Barge, Pleas'd with the Sacred weight of its Majestick charge; Argos a less Glorious Freight, From impov'rish'd Colchos brought The Cretan Sea now vanquish'd, must confess Its Burthen meaner, and its Tryumph less; Since richer Thames doth James and Mary bear, HE great as Jove, SHE as Europa Fair. They come! Joy doubles Strength to ev'ry Oar, Ecchoes fill the wondring Shore, The Waves with an unusual Pride, Pay Homage to the Lord Of our asserted Main, And calmly as they Glide, Auspiciously afford An Omen of His Reign.
III. See, Glorious as the Eastern Sun, Our Monarch from the Waters rise, Whilst Zealous Crowds, like Persians run To own the Blessing by their Sacrifice. He comes, Religious Shouts proclaim Him near, JAMES and HOSANNA bless the Ear; Delighted Heav'n confirms the Joys, And in glad sounds reflects the Image of the Voice. IV. Tryumphant CAESAR in less Tryumph rode, Though from a Victor to be made a God, When Captive Monarchs trembled by His side, And by their shame increas'd His Pride; No private Sorrows here allay The common transports of the day, But in each exalted Breast (Of Happiness and JAMES possest) Is Evidently shown, His People's Blessing's greater than His Own, And he that gives the Tryumph, Tryumphs least. V. With weaker Shouts did Israel Ring, Less esteem'd the Heavenly Choice, Less approv'd the Prophets Voice That Crown'd their wishes in a King. For wandring Asses did bestow On Saul that Title to a Throne, Which Providence to JAMES doth owe For His Fore-fathers Virtues, and His own. VI. Next, Fancy, to the Altar bring, Second to him we there Adore; the King By the Anointing Prelate met, And Rising, where the mighty Brother Set. But (Oh,) forbid the Omen Heav'n, And Guard the Blessing you have giv'n, Late He Possest, long may he fill the Throne, And for the Nations Bliss, defer his own. FINIS.
