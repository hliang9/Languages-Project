A prono¦stication for the yere of our LORD GOD M. CCCCC. xliiii Practysed by the right expert Doctour in Astronomy and phi∣sycke Maister Cornelys Scute resydent in Bridges in the wolfe strete.
¶ To the Reder. BEfore I begin to come to my principall Pro∣nosticatiō of this yere I haue taken in hand fyrst to rebuke the pro¦heme of a certayne Pronosticatiō in the yere of our lorde a thousand fyue hundreth xliii. last past / made by one maister Henry swart / of A∣sperne: which dyd his vttermost to make the people beleue that the scy¦ence of Astronomye is nothynge worth / but euyll: and the same is also a gret hyndraunce to the helth of mans body / and that some Phi¦sytions do ascribe the cause of syc∣nesses (agaynst all reason) to come by the heauens / Starres / Plane∣tes / Eclipses and Comettes. & cet. Sayeng / that if so be that this de∣uelisshe cōnyng had not ben taken
vp / many one shuld yet haue lyued longer. Cōmaundyng by his Pro¦nostication to all Phisitions / that they shuld leue this connyng of A∣stronomye / alonely to practyse the right bokes of surgery. And also more iniury hath he done agaynst this excellent cōnyng / which were to longe here to expresse. Now to come to euery poynt afore wrytten only to testifye / that the same con∣nyng of Astronomy is nedefall / & principally for Phisytions to my∣nister by to them that haue nede of it / for to helpe and cure the body of man. So it is of a truth / that Hi∣pocrates / whose auctorotye and ex¦cellency in surgery he can not deny by reason / all this sayenge in the Greke tonge / now tourned in to Englysshe: who that shall gyue himself
ing of the sicknes shalbe of vomy¦tynge coller or wamblynge of the mawe. All such lyke sycknes shall be apte to take all colde congealed maters: for as moche as the mone is not shadoed wt any other good Planetes / the man shall dye in the first quadrāt / that is to wyt / whan the mone shall come the thyrd syne folowyng: But if the mone be sha¦doed with any good planets / than shall the man ouer comme it in the first quadrant: that is to wyt / with in. vii. or. viii. days after. Also Gallene sayth in the ende of the sa∣me boke ī this maner: that a good Phisytion oughte to haue euer in his remembraunce the scyence of Astronomy / and that with all his endeuer ought to enquyre the day and tyme whan the sycknes began
or what tyme the hurte or fall / or o∣ther such lyke chaunsed / and must loke than after what sorte the he∣uens & starres stode at that tyme / consydring that here in this world chaunseth nothing / but by the pro∣curement of the heuen aboue. Also the gret lerned man Hermes Termegiscus / speketh after this maner: A good Phisytion whiche shall helpe a man by cōnyng / must beholde the constitution or inclina¦tion of heuē / with the starres / how they agre togither. Also Aristotle sayth / in the fyrst boke and second chapiter. Also Auicen Doctrina. i. cap, vii, Secundum res celestes & res terrestres eueniūt, ille uero que res secuntur celestes, sunt sicut ea que stellaū causa accidunt, est enim cū¦multe ex stellis in uno coniungitur
loco et coniungitur soli, et prouenit ex hoc califactio multa. Item Ab∣homeron / Abinzoer / an excellent Phisytion sayth. libro primo cap. vii. in epilepsia paroxismi: Fieri cō¦sueuerunt ex operatione super cele∣stium corporum que a deo uiuo & ue¦ro parfectionem & influentiam habe¦re & resipere sciuntur. To this he putteth to thuetoritie of Arnoldus de uilla noua and Rasys and other lerned Phisytions / whose wordes here to declare wolde be to longe / remembryng also that here is wyt¦nessed ynough agaynst the contra∣ry sayeng of the aforesayd maister Henry: that the Scyence of Astro∣nomy is a godly connynge & nede∣full for Phisitions to know. Item where as the aforesayd M. Henry sayth / that the Pronostica∣tions
saye not euer trew / is made answere ynough by Ptolome quin to ecētenis enuntiato. And also by Iohan Pontanium in the coment there vpon made / And also in pro∣hemio libri su. ii. de rebus celestib{us}. it wold be to longe to reherse word for word in this lytell boke. Item this M. Henry sayth in the same Prouosticatiō (without discretiō) of a chylde of. xii. yeres. slepyng na¦turally / goyng and standyng / that within two yeres had neither eten nor drōken / sayeng that euery one learned in that naturall connynge ought to applye them selues to ma¦ke a naturall answer or reasō there vnto / the whiche he hoped to do a∣fore her face: whiche is a straunge vnderstandyng to gyue there vnto a naturall reason / which is befall
contrary agaynst all nature / folo∣wynge the sentence of Hipocrates in Aphoris. 14. where he sayth that it is agaynst goddes commaunde∣ment to gyue confydence to the pro¦nostication: so say I that it is true that we shall not beleue it so fayth∣fully as the word of god in the gos¦pell or by the prophetes which can not lye in no wyse / but must be euē as they be spoken iuxta illud, Mat. xxiiii. but it may be lauful to gyue such credence there vnto as we gy∣ue to phisycke & other. We none o∣therwyse doo dispose than the na∣turall sygnes do declare / beholdīg that the workes be wonderous ex∣ceding all iudgementes of nature. And ye shall vnderstand that I ha¦ue not sayd this before mencyoned not in derisyon or to shame the a∣foresayd
maister Henry / but alon∣ly for his vnlauful opinion that he had to argue vpon agaynst thexel∣lent connyng of Astronomy. ¶ The Operation of the foure Eclypses of this yere. WE shall haue in this Lepe yere / foure Eclypses / that is to wyt / thre of the mone and one of the sonne. The fyrst E∣chyppes of the Mone shall befall the tenth day of Ianuary at vi. of the clocke before none / which shal be of. xii. poyntes & xlvi. mynutes / so that the Mone shall abyde hole darkened xli min. and shall conty∣nue her Eclyppes thre houres and xxviii. mi. The Mone shall be a∣bout the Northwest / with hye exal¦tacion
aboue the earth / in the myd¦des of the Eclyppes / and shall not as yet be all about lyght whan it goeth downe. Mars / Iupiter and Saturnus shall stande aboute the sonth southeast. Venus and Mer∣curius shall ascende in the hyghest whan the darkenesse of the Mone begynneth to vanysshe away: they shall haue for their ascendent / the fyrst degre of capricorn in the myd¦des of heuen / in the xxvi. degre of libra. The Mone shalbe in the .vii. house of heuen / and shal begyn the operation of this Eclyppes about August / as Ptolome sayth. The second Eclyppes. THe second Eclyppes shalbe of the Sonne / the .xxiiii. daye of Ianuary at viii. a clocke xxiii. min. before none / and shallbe
of . poyntes / almost. xvii. min, so that all the hole Sonne saue a ly¦tell shalbe darkened. The Sonne shall stand south southest with the mone / which shall stand right vn∣der the Sonne / so that in our ori∣sone if shal hynder and take away the brightnesse of the Son: which Eclyppes and also other Eclypses before goyng we shall well & par∣fytly se if that ye se the mone or the sonne. And if case be that through darkenesse of the wether we shuld not se the sōne or the mone / yet the Eclyppes shall be neuer the lesse if  shuld not se it. The Eclyppes shall haue before his ascendent the xii. degre of Aries. Venus shalbe in the vi. degre of capricorne right south / syttyng in the myddes of he¦uen, Iupiter & Saturnus shalbe
in the eyght house about the south¦west: all the seuen planetes shall as than be aboue ye erth / that is to wyt / thre in the eight house / two in the tenthe house / and two in the xi. house / which shalbe wonderfull & of great mistery. Out of these iiii. Eclipses shalbe brought forth wonderfull maters / as we shall ex¦presse here after. Mars shall be in the Eclyppes of the Sonne in the house of death, in Scorpio. in pro∣pria domo, gaudio {pro}prio. & propria triplicitate. Iupiter shalbe in pro∣prio casu, betwene Saturne and Mars / in the eyght house of death also. ▪ Here after foloweth the thyrde Eclyppes of the Moone.
THe thyrd Eclyppes shalbe of the mone / & shalbe the fourth day of Iuly viii. a clocke. xxi mi. after none / and shall be of xvii. poyntes & xv. my. so that the mone shalbe hole darke i, houre & a halfe & shall endure longer than the first and shall be almost hole darkened whan it shall ryse in the est: so that it shall seme to be a wonderfull ma¦ter. Saturnus and Iupiter shall syt togyther in the south / & Mars beneth the southeast / Mercurius in the west northwest. The ascen∣dent shalbe the viii. degre of aqua∣tius. The Son shalbe in the viii. house. The operation of this shall begyn incontynently after that the Eclippes shalbe passed / and shall fall very stronge at that tyme.
A fourth Eclyppes. THe fourth Eclyppes is of the Moone / & shalbe the. xxix, day of December / at. vi. a clocke &. xx. myn. before noone / and shalbe of xiiii. poyntes. xviii. myn. Than shal ye moone sit about ye northwest before the day / and shall go downe all blacke & darkened. The moone shalbe an hole houre darke and. iii myn. and shall endure from the be∣gynnynge to thende thre houres & xxxvi. mynu. and shall haue the self same ascēdēt Iunii. mediū cli. and also occasū with gods / also thother houses of the heuēs shalbe euen as the heuens were at the tyme of the other foresayd eclypsis / which shal be a wonderous matter / as is well knowen to all astronomers. Iupi∣ter and Marcurius shall syt bothe southeast / in the xii. hous about the
erth. Saturne shall syt in the south southeast / and so forth all the other planettes shalbe vnder the erth / the ascendent shalbe the fyrst degre of Capricornus / in the myddes of the heuens / in the rxvi, degre of Libra and so forth as it is in the foresayd Eclipses ¶ Of sycknesses that shall reygne this yere. PArusing the signes made vpō the calculations of heuens / the tymes of the foure Eclipsis afore¦sayd / I fynde that this yere shalbe apte to great burnyng and feruent sycknesses / of the which many peo∣ple shall dye / yt that the mercyful∣nes of god do not helpe: It is to be doubted of great deth. There shall
reygne moche payne in the heade / in the throte / in the sydes / with bur¦nynge agues / and so forth. Those that hath Scorpio / Pisces / or Can¦cer in the myddes of heuens with one aspect quadrant / or the opposi∣tion of Saturne or Mars shal be this yrre sore vexed with sycknes∣ses / comonly with the foresayd tri∣plicitye / or of suche lyke humours or matters as the aforesayd tripli∣citye is gyuynge and bryngynge forth. ¶ Of all growynge thynges AL thynges that by the au∣ctour of Mars and Venus are ascribed vnto / and are vnder theyr protection / shal prospere well
this yere / and encrease to the great auaūtage of the people. They may stande in ieopardye in the begyn∣nynge of Apryll / and in the ende of Marche / but they shal {pro}spere well agayne in the buddynge tyme / but those that haue Iupiter and Sol to their protector / shall haue moche hynderaūce in their buddyng / how be it there shalbe succour done frō other quarters / so that they shall not be very deare. ¶ Of the foure ceasons of the yere / and fyrst of Wynter. WHat tyme the foure seasons of the yere begyn I haue shewed vnto the people ynough in tymes past / so yt they ought now to know that them selues / wherfore it is no nede to speake more of that / but go
vnto the properties and inclinatiō of the foure quarters of the yeare / than must I fyrst make mencion of the Wynter / which is vntemperat / and than of the two Eclypsis / the one of the Sonne / & the other of the Moone / whiche shalbe in Ianuary nexte cōmynge very vntemperate / with greate tempestes of wyndes / and shalbe apt to frost ynough / du∣rynge longe / but not so sore as the last wynter was. Gouernours of landes / cytyes / & castels must than take good hede / and weapon them agaynst treason / for there shall be many secretly conspyred / and than shal reygne vnreasonable sortes of sycknesses / and in some places pe∣stilens in generall / with dyuers o∣thers / Wherfore I wyll speake no more of that.
Of the Lent season. IN the Lent season shal there be moch rumoure and newes of warres. And there shall as thā raygne many new diseases which shalbe very harde for Phisytions and Surgyons to cure. And it shall be in the begynnynge colde / with raynes hayle and snowe. Of the Somer. THe Somer begynneth the xi day of Iune at ten of the clocke at night / and shall haue for his ascendent the tenth degre of A∣quarius in the myddes of heuens. The fyrst degree of Sagittarius and Iupiter shallbe in the nyenth house / and Mars in the leuēth / the
Sonne in the fyfth house / and shal be after her signification enclyned to great bloude shedynge and also to great vexations / seditions and warres, also it semeth that thorow thexpectation of Iupiter & Mars with the sextile aspect / Spirituall persones / as the bysshop of Rome & other may well go aboute to ma∣ke n appoyntement / but they shal no bringe it to passe nor to none ef¦fecte / and also with great faruent and hote sicknesses shal they be in∣fected / whiche shall come of the in∣ward partes with gret feuers and paynes in the head & also pestilens Of the Haruest. ¶ The Haruest this yere shalbe somewhat warmer and dryer than
it hath ben in tymes past / in the be∣gynnynge with moche dew / in the ende with moche rayne / and shalbe wyndy among / with a lytel rayne. There shall than reygne many a∣gues and quarteyns / with paynes in the heed / in some places with pe¦stilens: of the collycke shall many people be infected. ¶ Of the xii. monethes and their quarters.

Let vs pray vnto god earnestly / that he may fasten the

PHillip the sonne of Charles kyng of Spayne / who shalbe of age in the yere of our lorde god M. v. C. xliiii. xvii. yeres old / and he hath in his reuolution this yere the first degre of Pisces / for his as∣cendent is in the fyrst house / Lun in the fourth / Iupiter / Sol / Ve∣nus / and Marcurius / al in octaua, pars fortune in nona, Saturnus in sexta, soo that his fygure this yere is enclyned to be almost as it was in his byrthe / after the influ∣ence of the planets / whiche shalbe
a wonderfull token / and shall be through Mars / beynge about the ascendent / and he shall be this yere very liberall to those that employ themselues vnto hym in feates of weapōs / and shalbe hymselfe won∣derous desyrous to warre / for to vaynquysh his fathers ennemyes / so that he through the gyfte of for∣tune shalbe very strong / as well by the helpe and assistens of the spiri∣tualtye as of the temporaltye / and shall gete great victory / and con∣quere by warre. Saturnus beyng in the sixth house thretneth his ma∣iesty somwhat with sycknes of his body ex humoribus crassis, and also calcuiosis ex materia viscida, wher∣fore he must take good hede of hym selfe / & that with good aduysement the more bycause that Sol and Iu¦piter
are in the eyght house. ¶ Of thr Emperours maiestye. CHarles the fyfthe Emperour of Rome / after the fygure of his reuolution of this yere. M. v. hundreth and. xliiii. shall haue for his ascendent the xi. degre of Leo / and in the myddes of heuens Aries domū Martis cum casum Saturnus whiche at the tyme of his birth had a lucky fygure of the heuēs / so that Iupiter / Sol / Marcurius pars for¦tune and Venus were all in domo secunda, whiche shall this yere be so sore mynded to warre as euer he was in his lyfe / and shall through Aries beynge in the tenth house / be counseylled, aspectu trino & sextile, of good planets / and they be therin
very lucky / & shall haue great vi∣ctory and prospere gretly, Neuer∣the lesse / bycause that Mars is in the fyfth house / & Saturnus and Iupiter in the fourthe house / it is greatly to be coniectured / that he shal haue some gret thing agaynst him / so that his mynde shalbe of∣ten troubled / but yet he shall ouer∣come all at length / through Sol beynge Lorde of thascendent / but not without gret bloude shedyng of many men / bycause that the lord of thascēdent is lodged in the viii. house which is the house of death But through Venus beyng in the syxth house / there might chaunce some inconuenyence of sycknesse vnto him / how be it / it shall notte hynder him. And also he shalbe in many feates of warre victoriouse /
and shalbe feared sore of his ene∣myes / whiche shall bere vnto him secretly a good hert. Of the kyng of Englandes Maiestye. HEnry the eight / king of En∣glande / who was .lii. yeres olde in the moneth of Iune last past / hauynge in his re∣uolution of this yere Saturnus in the Ascendent of Virgo / in the myddes of heuen. And his maie∣stye shall bere him selfe wisely this yere in all his affayres / and shall be also lucky in his settynge for the through the excellency of Fortune beyng in the myddes of the heuēs with Iuppiter and Venus in the ix, house: wherfore he shall trium∣phe in money & gyftes beyng very
lyberall. It shall be good to serue him this yere / by cause that Mercu¦rius is lorde of the myddes of he∣uens. In warres he shall also pro∣spere & haue great fortune / bycause that Luna is in the viii. house / wel infourmed aspectu sextill of other good Planetes. His Realme shall prospere in the feates of merchun∣dyse / and be fortunate. And he shal haue more honoure this yere / than he hath had in many yeres past wt specyall loue of his subiectes. And shalbe in the lent very earnest for some causes that hath ben longe in his here for to bryng it to a good ende / effecte and purpose.
¶ Of the Frenche Kynge, FRauncys / the French kig & fyrst of that name / who is in the moneth of Sep∣tember next commynge. l. yeres olde. After the reuolution of this yeare he shall oftentymes be heuy of chere / and shall haue great losse in his dominion / & shall haue but lytell good lucke in the feates of warre. Some of his gentylles shall secretly departe from hym / he shal do his vttermost by one thyrd person to entreate for peace / but it shall not preuayle / his coūtrey shal be sore vexed euery where / he is al∣so enclined to fal in to a great syck¦nes and dredefull / Mars fortunate is to hym lodged in an vnfortuna∣ble house / hauyng very euyll aspe∣ctes
in his ascendent & in the myd∣des of the heuēs / wherfore he hath nede to loke wysely aboute him & his subiectes. In his owne par∣sone he wyll come to the felde / but he shall bere awaye lytell honoure or lucke. Finis. ¶ Thus endeth the Pronosti∣cation for the yere of our lord a M. v.

¶ An aduertysement. PTolome sayth in the C. xx. conclusyons / on this wyse Enterprise not with iern to open any membre whan the Mone is in any Signe that hath dominion of that membre: By the which wor∣des / the Philosopher wyl haue vs to obserue the course of the Mone in pourgynge of the bodyes / by∣cause that the operation of the mo∣ne is to moysten the bodyes, This is parceyued effectually in the greued membre that is subiect vnto the Sygne where in the mo∣ne is vpon any day / where by it fo¦loweth / that it is not lefull to opē that membre / as longe as the Moone is in that Sygne F. ii.
The nature of the twelue heuenly Sygnes. The xii. heuenly Sygnes wor∣kyng in vs / are lyke vnto foure ele¦mentes. These in wor¦kyng are hote drye / fyrye and coloricke Aries Leo Sagittarius These in wor¦kyng ar colde drye / earthy & melancolycke.

C C xlv. days & a quarter of a day It is to be noted also that a daye contayneth foure & twenty houres and the houre xl, mynutes. Of Phlebotony or bloud lettinge ¶ In lettynge of bloude are these thre to be obserued / namely the cō∣uenyent sygnes where in the mone is / the complexion and the age of a man. The sygnes conuenyent for the sanguynes are: Taurus / Vir∣go and Capricornus. For the cole∣rycke / Cancer / Scorpio & Pisces For the melancolycke / Libra & A∣quarius. For the flegmarycke: A∣ries and Sagittarius. Leo is an euyll Sygne to let bloud in. Fur∣thermore / Age is to be consydred
also  quarter of the Mone is apte for yonge age / the seconde for myddle age / the third & fourth for olde age. ¶ An obseruation for Phisycke. Whan the Moone is in sygnes that be hote / than is the power at∣tractyue by heate & drought / whan it is in erthy / than is the power at¦tractyue: whan it is in ayrie sygnes than is the powre digestyue. ¶ Imprinted at London in the Olde Bayly in Sayntpoulchres paryssh by Rychard Lant / for Rychard Grafton.
