❧By the King. ❧A Proclamation forbidding all Levies of Forces without His Majesties expresse pleasure, signified under His Great Seal, and all Contributions or Assistance to any such Levies. WHereas, under pretence that VVe intend to make VVar against the Parliament (the contrary whereof is notoriously known to all that are here, and as we hope by this time apparent to all other Our Subjects, as well by Our Declaration of the sixteenth of Iune, as by the Testimonie of all Our Nobility and Councell, who are here upon the place) And by colour of the Authoritie of both Houses of Parliament (a major part whereof are now absent from London) by the contrivance of some few evill persons, disguising and colouring their pernicious Designes and hostile Preparations under the plau∣sible names of The preservation of publike Peace, and defence of us, and both Houses of Parliament from Force and and Violence, it hath been endeavoured to raise Troopes of Horse and other Forces: And for that purpose they have prevailed, not onely to prohibit Our own Moneys to be paid to Ʋs, or to Our use, but, by the Name and Authoritie of Parliament, to excite Our Sub∣jects to contribute their Assistance to them, by bringing in Moneys, Plate, or underwriting to furnish and maintain Horses, Horsmen, and Arms; And to that purpose certain Propositions or Orders (as they are styled by them) have been Printed, whereby they have endeavoured to en∣gage the Power and Authoritie of Parliament (as if the two Houses, without Ʋs, had that Power and Authoritie) to save harmlesse, all those that shall so contribute, from all Preju∣dice and Inconvenience that may befall them by occasionthereof. And although we well hope that these Malignant persons (whose Actions do now suffici∣ently declare their former Intentions) will be able to prevail with few of Our good people to contribute their Power or Assistance unto them; Yet, lest any of Our Subjects (taking upon trust what those Men affirm) without weighing the grounds of it, or the danger to Ʋs, themselves, and the Common-wealth, which would ensue thereupon, should indeed be∣leeve (what these persons would insinuate, and have them to beleeve) That such their Contri∣bution and Assistance would tend to the preservation of the publike Peace, and the Defence of Ʋs and both Houses of Parliament, and that thereby they should not incur any danger; We, that we might not be wanting (as much as in Ʋs lieth) to foreshew and to prevent the danger which may fall thereupon, Have hereby thought good to declare and publish unto all Our loving Subjects, That by the Laws of the Land, the power of raising of Forces or Arms, or leavying of war for the defence of the Kingdom, or otherwise, hath always belong∣ed to Ʋs, and and to Ʋs onely, and that by no Power of either, or both Houses of Parliament, or otherwise, contrary to Our personall Commands, any Forces can be raised, or any war
And therefore, by the Statute of the seventh yeer of Our famous Progenitour, King Ed∣ward the first, whereas there had been then some variances betwixt him and some great Lords of the Realm, and, upon Treaty thereupon, it was agreed, that in the next Par∣liament after provision should be made, That in all Parliaments, and all other Assemblies which should be in the Kingdom for ever, that every man should come without Force and Armour, well and peaceably: Yet at the next Parliament when they met together to take advice of this Businesse (though it concerned the Parliament it self) the Lords and Com∣mons would not take it upon them, but answered, That it belonged to the King to defend Force of Armour, and all other Force against the Peace at all times when it pleased Him, and to punish them which should do contrary, according to the Laws and Ʋsages of the Realm, and that they were bound to aid Him, as their Soveraign Lord, at all seasons when need should be. And accordingly in Parliament, in after times, the King alone did issue His Pro∣clamations, prohibiting bearing of Arms by any person, in, or neer the Citie where the Parli∣ament was, excepting such of the Kings Servants as He should depute, or should be deputed by His Commandment, and also excepting the Kings Ministers. And by the Statute of Northampton, made in the second yeer of King Edward the third, it is Enacted, That no man, of what condition soever he be (except the Kings Servants, in His presence, and His Ministers in executing the Kings Precepts, or of their Office, and such as be in their company assisting them) go, nor ride Armed by night or day in Fairs, Markets, nor in the presence of the Iusti∣ces, or other Ministers, nor in no part elsewhere. And this power of raising Forces to be solely in the King, is so known and inseparable a right to the Crown, That when, in the reign of King Henry the eight, there being a sudden Rebellion, the Earl of Shrewsbury, without Warrant from the King, did raise Arms for the sup∣pression thereof, and happily suppressed it, yet was he forced to obtain his Pardon. And whereas the Duke of Gloucester, and other great Lords, in the eleventh yeer of King Richard the second (upon pretence of the good of the King and Kingdom, the King being then not of age, and led away, as they alleadged, by evil Counsellours) did raise Forces, and by them ma∣stered their Adversaries. In that Parliament (such as it was, for it was held and kept with Force, how good use soever hath been made of the Presidents therein) they procured a speciall Act of Pardon for their raising of Men, and that those Assemblies should not be drawn into example for the time to come. And as no man can leavie War, or raise Forces without the King, so much lesse against the personall Commands of the King opposed thereunto: For, by the Statute of the 25. yeer of King Edward the third (which is but Declaratory of the old Law in that point) it is Treason to leavie war against the King in His Realm; within the construction of which Statute, it is true (which was said in the late Declaration, under the name of both Houses of Parliament, of the 26. of May last) leavying War (in some sense) against the Kings Authority (though not in∣tended against His Person) is leavying war against the King: And therefore the raising of Forces, though upon pretence of removing of some evil Counsellors from about the Queen, hath been adjudged Treason, in the Case of the late Earle of Essex in the Reign of Queen Eliza∣beth, and in divers other Cases. (And we wish all Our Subjects to consider, Whether, if men shall be raised contrary to Our Proclamation and against Our Will, it be not against Our Au∣thority.) But it is as true (and was never denied, but in that Declaration) That the raising of Forces against the Kings personall Command (being no Ideot, nor Infant, uncapable of understanding to Command) being accompanied with His presence, is, and is most properly leavying of War against the King; For if it be a sufficient pretence for raising of Men against the Kings person, that it is for the defence of the Kings Authority, and of His Kingdom (though against His expresse Command and Proclamation) the Irish Rebels will have colour for their horrid Rebellion; For they say (though it be notoriously false) It is for the defence of the Kings Authority, and of His Kingdom; And Wat Tyler, and Jack Cade, and Kett the Tanner want∣ed not publike Pretences, which were perhaps just causes of Complaints, though not of rai∣sing of Men. And though these persons have gone about subtilly to distinguish betwixt Our Person and Our Authority, as if, Because Our Authority may be where Our Person is not, that there∣fore, Our Person may be where Our Authority is not; We require all Our good Subjects to take notice of the Law (which is in Print and full Force) Cook 7. Rep. Calvins case. That their Allegiance is due unto the naturall Person of their Prince, and not to His Crown or Kingdom distinct from His naturall Capacitie. And that by the Oath of Ligeance at the Common Law (which all persons above the age of twelve yeers are, or ought to be sworn unto) they are bound to
be true and faithfull, not to the King onely as King, but to Our Person as King CHARLES; and to bear Ʋs truth and faith of Life and Member, and earthly Honour; and that they shall neither know nor hear of any ill or damage intended to Ʋs that they shall not defend. And that when, in the time of King Edward the second, Hugh Spencer being discontented with the King, caused a Bill to be written, wherein was contained amongst other things, That Homage and the Oath of Allegiance was more by reason of the Kings Crown (that is, His Kingdom) then of His Person; and that seeing the King cannot be reformed by suit of Law, if the King will not redresse and put away that which is ill for the Common People, and hurtfull to the Crown That the thing ought to be put away by force, and that His Leiges be bound to Govern in aid of Him, and in default of Him; he was condemned for it by two Par∣liaments, and perpetually vanished the Kingdom. We have made mention of these cases, not so much to cleer Our Right, That We alone have the power of raising Forces, and none of Our Subjects, either in Parliament or out of Parlia∣ment against Our Will, or personall Command (which We think no man that hath the least knowledge in Our Laws, and is not led away by private Interests, and may speak his minde freely, will deny; nor was ever questioned in any Parliament before this time) as to let them see how dangerous the effect and consequence of raising of Forces, without Ʋs, may be unto Ʋs, and to the Common-wealth, uuder pretence of Defence of both. And though We cannot doubt of the affections of Our good Subjects, considering their in∣terest is involved with Ours, and how precious the peace of the Kingdom is, and ought to be unto them; and that according to the words of the Statute of the eleventh yeer of King Henry the seventh, and the eighteenth Chapter, By the duty of their Allegiance they are bounden to serve and assist Ʋs at all seasons when need shall require. Yet, to the end that Our good Subjects may know what their duty is, and what We expect from them, and that all others, who, through Malice or private Interests, shall be transported beyond their duties, may be left without excuse; we do therefore by this Our Proclamation charge and command all Our Subjects uopn their Allegiance, and as they tender Our Honour and Safety, and the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom, that they presume not to raise or leavie any Horses, Horsmen, or Arms, or any Forces whatsoever, by colour of any Authority whatso∣ever, without Our expresse pleasure signified under Our great Seal, (other then such as shall be raised, leavied and imprested by the Order, as well of Our Self, as of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, according to an Act made this Sessions, intituled, An Act for the better raising and leavying of Souldiers for the present defence of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland (by Iustices of Peace, and otherwise, in such manner as is prescribed in the said Act) or Contribute, or give any Assistance in Money, Plate, finding of Horses, horsmen, or Arms, or any other wayes, to or for any such Preparation, Levie, or Forces: And that such of Our good Subjects, who through Ignorance have been mis-led to consent or subscribe to any such Leavie, Contribution, or As∣sistance, forthwith, upon publication of this Our Proclamation, desist from continuing such their Contribution or Assistance, or giving any Countenance to any such Leavies, at their ut∣most perils. And We do likewise straitly Charge and Command as well all Sheriffs, Iustices of Peace, Majors, Bailiffs, Constables, and all other Our Officers whatsoever, That they use their utmost endeavours, as well for publishing this Our Proclamation, as for the suppressing of all Leavies, or Forces raised, or to be raised without or against Our consent: As also all other Our loving Subjects, That they be attending, Aiding, and Assisting Our said Officers and Ministers therein, as they, and every of them will answer it at their utmost perils. Given at Our Court at York the eighteenth day of June, in the eighteenth yeer of Our Reign. 1642. ¶Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of John Bill. 1642.
