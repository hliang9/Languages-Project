TWO EPISTLES, Written to all Friends in the Truth: The one, touching the Perfection of HUMILITY; Written in Rome-Prison of Madmen. The Other, Touching the RIGHTEOUS ORDER OF JUDGEMENT IN ISRAEL. Written at Lyons in France, By the Servant of God, JOHN. LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, at the sign of the Black-spread-Eagle and Windmil, in Martins Le Grand, 1661.
CONCERNING HUMILITY JOHN the Prisoner, to the Little LAMBS, SALUTATION. GOD Almighty is greater than the swelling and boyling Waves of a troubled, angry, raging Sea; for though she rouls the unsetledness of her Outrage as the Tumblings of Mountain after Mountain; yet He which ruleth on high (ordering [in his unsearchable Counsel] all things for the Advantage of good Prosperity and Happiness of all the constant, setled & faithful-hearted; whose Delight, with∣out wearisomeness, is to trust in his Living Name, and Eternal Supream Power) can make all in a moment, and turning of a short space, become as standing Oyl. Thus saith the Voice which is holy, which is true, which is living and faithful; Who hath Power but the LORD? Or, where is there permission but of the Mighty One? Where is Counsel but with the Eter∣nal Wisdom, who purgeth Jacob in his way, and befooleth his Foes in the very open wayes, and narrowest and secretest paths of their own Outgoings and Designs? Who hath known the LORD, and will not trust in Him for an Everlasting Good? Who hath trusted in the God of Salvation, that can say his Trust hath perish∣ed in the end, and the peace of his soul is fled from him? Or, can his Servants say that He is as a man, or like unto the son of man which remembreth not the way, nor enclineth unto the Cry of the Just? Verily, the Seas may sink through the Earth, and be no more, as the Waters in her belly, and the whole Earth become as a whirled dust out of a golden Ballance; Yet is there Iudg∣ment with the Lord for Worm Jacob, and a Covenant of Righteousness for Israel. Moreover, Though Nature may dege∣nerate from her proper kind, the Cow nor the Asse, the Camel nor the Old Lionness; nay, nor the Nurse nor the Mother have
any more pitty or compassion to the fruits of their own bowels to suckle or nourish them in due season, though they might harden their hearts, and shut their ears from the Cryes of their own flesh, and should loath and abominate their languishings unto death; yet is there Compassion with the God of David for the humble and contrite-hearted, and Deliverance with the God of Moses for the Seed of his own Host, though they are straitned by the Red Sea-side: Therefore lift up your heads, O ye little Lambs, and breath to your Keeper in the spirit of fear and reverence, sancti∣fying his NAME in your hearts, in the Life of Faith and Obedience, until the Rod be stretched over the Floods; for then shall you march with dry shoes through the mighty deeps, with the Songs of Salvation in your Way; But the joyning hands of the divided Waters will cover the running stones of the Defences of Egypt, as Rocks that are cast to the bottoms; doubled then shall your Psalms be, Yea, and trebly tuned unto the highest Land and Glory of Him which rules in the Heavens above. This is the Day wherein God Almighty is trying and pro∣ving with what an eye you are enclined to look into the Life of his humility, who shews himself as a servant unto Man, walk∣ing his Corn-fields, and attending him with Bread and all things; who feeds the Worms of the workmanship of his hands, and refresheth the creeping things with the lowly and humble At∣tendance of his own most infinit bowels of Mercies; yea, he walks in the deeps of the Seas, amongst the Worms that creep in the bot∣tom of her belly and womb, watching and waiting as the dili∣gence of all diligence to serve them in all wants. Ah! what shall I say of the King of Glory, to whom the Sun, Moon and Stars are but as a shadow, and the Firmament of the Heavens but as a dark and gloomy vail? Surely, when I consider the Glory of the most Eternally glorious, full of Wisdom, Strength, Power, Ver∣tue, Light and Brightness (the height of whose Majesty in all things which glorious are, there's no end of space to reach) how He hath humbled Himself to come down in the lowliness of his Life, to serve me (his dispised of man) with the greatness and grace of His rich Compassions, it moves and melts my heart be∣fore him, and even now makes me cry in the Spirit, saying, Oh that the Wisdom of the most wise and humble would encrease with me for ever, to the end, instructing me to serve, as He
serveth in the humbleness of his wisest Life. Children this is the deep place where you are to sink down into, in this the day of the tryal of spirits, to know of what nature they are: So here, try your selves, and prove your selves, and see if you can serve the Worms of God, which creep upon the face of the Earth (even as God serveth them) according to the measure and proportion of the wisdom and knowledge which from God you have received; search your selves, and examine your selves, whether in nature and true kind you can serve, as God Almighty serveth, the poor creeping things; or serve Lazarus the poor man, as God Eternal served him in Dogs, and the World saw it not: Yea, and question your selves, and try your hearts, that you may know, whether you can serve God in that lowliness in which He daily serveth you; and so consider well how God Almighty provideth your food and rayment, and puts the bread in your mouths, and pours the water into your cups, and arrays you, and latches your shoes, and makes clean the filthy way before your footsteps; And if any among you have griefs or sores, or botches or painful boyls, God Almighty humbleth his compassionate Soul, and cometh down from on high, and stands exceedingly below you, where you see him not, and putteth out his tongue, and licketh your sore places, and so healeth the wounded, and saveth the sick from the grief of the malady. Oh my Beloved Ones! and dearest little Children and Lambs of God, I cannot tell you how infinitly you own tender and mer∣ciful Father standeth below you, and round about you, waiting and watching in grace and loving-kindness to serve you, whose day this is, which now is, wherein you must be tryed and proved, whether you bear the Image of his holy Spirit of Humility, as did Jesus the Just; and as you are found sinking down here into the low place, even in admiration, considering where (before this day) you dwelt in a house which had its Foundation above the Rocks of the deeps of the low places, whereon the highest Heavens are pitched, and therefore All must sink unto it and be firmly setled on it, where∣by ye may know the bosom of Love, from which all pure service doth proceed; service to God, service to man, service to beasts, service to fowls, service to fishes and service to worms, all in the Love, in which they were by the humble Spirit created, to be served of the humble Spirit, according to all their respective kinds; So here you may see the Eternal Wisdom dwelleth in the low place, where a
friend in the pure Spirit of Humility (which proceedeth out of the Eternal Bosom of Love, which created all things for a service, as God Almighty himself serveth all living creatures in the same Love and Lowliness) oughteth to sweep his friend's house and to latch his shoes, and make clean the way of his footsteps, yea, and to do it with the very sweat of his brow; which I speak in God Almighty's holy Spirit to all without respect of persons; For this will give all the Children true entrance and living ingress into the bowels of God's mercies, that as they (in the incomprehensible Love) are come down to serve in the low house, beneath all Earth, and Waters under the Earth, and there to give due attendance as God Almighty wait∣eth to serve all; and thus are Ministers in the feeling bowels of the unlimited pitties and compassions to all distresses, without respect of creatures or persons; in this manner gathering all into the unlimited∣ness of their bowels of mercies; So become, they gathered into the inmost part of the Eternal Bosom; and here the Life provoketh the Love, and the Love stirreth up the Bowels, and the Bowels of God are provoked to yearn in Himself, which brings home the Oppres∣sions of the Oppressed in a greater weight upon the Spirit of the Al∣mighty God, than if it were done to him alone, and in particu∣lar; for that they are the helpless Apple of his Eye, which cannot help it self, nor take out the pricking motes without the help of a careful and merciful hand. And therefore the GOD of your Hope (in the day of Affliction and Temptation) will arise and roar as a Lioness which is robbed of her Whelps, because her compassions go after her young; and the Nations shall dread and tremble, and the Host thereof shall fall by the high-way side; for as much as they carried away the spoil which they should have left in the Land, and have wasted the Tents of the Lord: And the house of the Spoiler shall be made a spoil before Him, and he which robbed the Labourer of his Hemp and Flax, as he beareth the burden thereof from his Neighbours door, it shall burn as a flame at his back. Wo unto Egypt, for the Lord is jealous: Wo unto Rimmon, for that the Anger of the God of Righteous∣ness and Judgment kindleth; Weep ye craggy Rocks, and howl ye exalted Mountains, and lament your part, O ye lofty Hills round about the Cities of Tyre and Sidon; For I will overturn saith the Lord God, and it shall be a day of ratling, even as if the Firma∣ment were falling with Thunders; Nations shall hear it and dread,
and I will have a Name of Righteousness, saith the Lord Almighty, even unto the ends of the whole earth. Then shalt thou sing O Daughter of my own Beloved, and gladness shall never depart from thy Scituation, O Damsel of my hearts delight; for I will be thine in an Oath, and thou shalt be mine in a perpetual Covenant, even for ever and evermore, saith the God of eternal love. In this Spirit therefore (which is of Power & Might, of Truth and Faithfulness) I have dearly to stir you up, and exhort you, to wait in the patience and content of the Life of the Lamb, submitting in the will of the Father unto every yoak, weight and burthen whatsoever, may be permitted to be put upon your necks and backs: and also in the true feeling of the Oppressions of every soul, put your backs to their burthen, whosoever they be, without respect of persons; for that Spirit is of God which is tender, and enclineth unto a feeling of every mans Yoak; for so did God Almighty feel, and pity, and compassionate them in their Sufferings, and under their Oppressions, which now do oppresse, and make the others to suffer by whom they formerly were oppressed; which the others should not have done then, neither should these do so now; Therefore do ye, the Children of God, even as your Father doth, stand between them both in the Spirit, which bears every man's Oppression and unjust load, and so you shew your selves to be of the Image of your Father, who thereby will enlarge his Glory very greatly in the whole Earth; for God will have such a sound to go unto the ends thereof, and gain himself a great Name of praise thereby: And as for you in this Spirit, your Reward shall be very great, and your Redemption shall certainly come; and ther∣fore again, I say let Patience have her perfect work; for the black horse which is Coloured over with blood, which now runneth the race, was never truly ayred, nor well breathed, and the Course from the first start, being a full loose upon switch and spur, will surely sink, before half the Race is run; and he which comes gently after on the moderate speed will obtain the mark and the prize. So though the little ones do eat their bread with the sweat of their brows for a season, it is but to prepare them, and their pure appetites to eat at a feast of fat things in the infinite worth, and incomprehensible price of an everlasting life of thanksgiving and praise unto him which prepa∣reth the Table. To which purpose, this the Lord God requireth of his People, rent souls, broken spirits, contrite hearts, breathing mindes, fervent pray∣ers,
and exceeding open bowels to God Almighty, in all things of your souls desires; for this is the Sacrifice which the Eternal Power re∣quireth from All without respect of persons, and he loveth the bro∣ken spirit, and hath respect unto the contrite heart, which I full well know by large testimony and experience; and now, the deeper I ponder it, the more it rents my inward parts, to consider the great∣ness of the Goodness of God, which answereth the full streams of the broken spirit and contrite heart, which I cannot but testifie, that Israel may drink refreshment even at the brim of the Cup-ful of my Consolations, and hold it as an exceeding Joy in his house, to go down and humble himself before his God in the rent soul, broken spirit, and exceeding contrite heart, to feel his Creator's acceptance of him in the day of his mourning before him. Enter, enter, and feel your thorough ingress into this house in the contrite heart, O all ye Children of the living God, that you may know your Father's Life, and bear his very Image and true likeness in all things; for his Spirit is wounded, and mourneth and grieveth, (in more contriteness than your eye can discern or reach) bear∣ing every man's oppressive burdens, without respect of persons: so you entring here into the deeps of the Spirit of God, the humble spirit of contriteness, you move the bowels of your Maker, and his bowels stir up his Power to return the Captivity of Judah, and of all the house of Israel, whose lot is to inhabit Jerusalem. And be it known unto you all, That God Almighty will be an∣gry with all such which do stand in a height (above the contrite and broken heart) saying in presumption, We are above and beyond all things in the outward which can annoy or hurt us, and God will bring down all such, and make them to know that if he is lived in, he will be lived in, even in his Spirit of contriteness, which infuseth the reverence, and fear, dread and trembling at his Name in the inward parts, where the broken heart must be witnessed, which is the true sacrifice which God requireth and accepteth: So he that is gone above the contrite heart is gone out of the acceptance with God, not having the true Sacrifice in which acceptance is found, and in that heart which is gone from the contriteness there is no true praise; for the low life is departed from, which only can praise Him which ruleth above all things, and so the creature goeth from his Creator and sacrificeth unto his own affection, and praiseth the delight of his own lust, and drowneth his poor soul in perdition.
Finally, my dear and everlastingly beloved little Lambs of the true Shepherd, in this Spirit my life labours with you, and the abun∣dance of my unspeakable love floweth forth unto you, even that which no Voice can tell you but the immediate Voice of God, which is nigh you; wherein I am rouled, bound up and sealed among and in you, greatly comforted concerning you, feeling a glorious and goodly num∣ber (in my daily prayers) of great price in the gracious eye of God; And many will passe thorough a fire which will make them shine as the Sun, and their fruit will be only to God. Ah! I cannot tell you of the Glory of the Day which cometh among you, for I am ravished and overcome in the sence of that Glory, which my weak and bleared eye can see; and truly the Glory is such, that for Glory I cannot behold, but I cry, but I cry, Oh! the depths of Love which will wound Enmity! Oh! the weight of Mercy which will kill Cruelty! Oh! the pleasantness of Patience which will extinguish Persecution! Oh! the depth of Wisdom which will work over Stratagems! Oh! the worth of Vertue, which will crown with Diadems! Oh! the dread of Life, and power of Supremacy, which will wear the Glory of an everlast∣ing Dominion! this will be the Sting, the Wo and the Tor∣ment unto every unclean spirit upon the face of the Earth, until she shall bear that spirit no more upon her face, but all things shall be as they were in the beginning, and God in more infinite measure gloriously known and enjoyed, than ever in any Age that is past since the dayes that Adam was made a true and living Soul. Grace, Mercy and Peace be unto you all, giving you growth in this Life. Amen. So reade me in the Word of God, and then reade this a second time over in your Congregations. Written in Rome-Prison of Mad-men.
Concerning Judgment. The Son of Love, Peace, and Unity, who is of the mind of Subjection unto the Spirits of the Prophets; To the Gather∣ed Seed of the Lord Almighty, Sendeth the Fruits of the Life of Concord, as a most sincere Salutation, unto them all, wheresoever upon the face of the Earth. BEloved Sisters and Brethren, I would that you should all know, in the deeps of the Spirit of Power and Glory, that GOD is but one Eternal Life of Love, Peace, and Everlasting Unity in Himself, not having in Him Pre∣judice, strength of a froward Will, lust of entrance into any other Na∣ture than His own, or Pride in His Throne of Glory; but is full of Love and Mercies unto Enemies, easie to be entreated of; Pure in Life, and the lowest and humblest in His Eternal mind, of all things beside Him; Yea, as He is Infinitely in Power above all the works of his hands, so in His Humility He is Immeasurably below them all, wherein the Excellency of His Beauty and Glory is seen to be above all, who is blessed, praised, and honoured of all that truly know Him, for ever, Amen. This therefore is His mind, unto all the Children of the Day, (viz.) That they should seek to have a dwelling in the brightness of the Glory of His Life, by feeling after Him in the lowest places of His habitati∣on, where righteous Judges in Israel shall be known, and righteous Judgement (which oppresseth not any, but is appointed for the Reve∣lation of Mercy unto all) shall be witnessed in the Consciences of eve∣ry raised Seed of Jacob, which shall preserve the Concord, Peace, Love, and everlasting Unity among all, even unto the determination of all Time; wherein the Restoration of all things shall come to pass, as it was first in the Original, before Transgression was; that there may not be the groan of a Creature under the bondage of Oppression; but the whole Earth, Seas, and all that in them is, become one entire
Body, made up of the perfection of the Glory of the Almighty Creator, that it may be an everlasting Song, of His highest Honour for ever and ever, Amen. I feel a Life, which in some years silence (through Tribulations and great Tribulations) in the secret continual exercise of the mind of the Spirit of holiness, through the deep mercies of God, hath attained unto a small measure of the understanding and knowledge of the Judg∣ments of its Maker: And therefore as one that hath obtained Mercy at the Tribunal of God, and is precepted to the same, am drawn forth of a free heart, to shew unto all the tender in Israel, That Order of Iudgement which is justified of the Lord God; that in the executi∣on thereof, without respect of Persons in Judgement, the Peace of his God's Holiness, may be kept in his Tents; and Love and Unity, in the richest blessings of Mercy be held and retained in his Land Ever∣lastingly. All that are born of the Seed of Promise, must grow into the simili∣tude of the glory of their heavenly Father in all things, which are holy and vertuous in the light of Life, which gives to see that God is not rigorous, rash, nor cruel; but tender, pitiful, forgiving, long-suf∣fering, and merciful; which sheweth the amiableness of His Glory in Judgment, in which Image of Glory, all the Children of Light must grow to be as their Father is; for which Cause in matters of unresol∣vedness or controversie betwixt Friend and Friend, Brother & Brother, it ought to be pondered, Whether the thing that is objected against, be sin? which if it so appears, and that also to the dishonour of God, and his Truth in the eye of the World, then shall there be an utter de∣nying of the sin, and a tender admonition given to that Person to for∣sake and repent of his sin: And so like wise Gardeners, ye ought to pluck up the Weeds, that the Plants may prosper in the ground, and prune the Tree, cutting off the unprofitable branches, that the profita∣ble may much more prosper, yeilding abundance of fruit, in due season, unto the Lord of the Vineyard; and not go too hastily and cut off a Twig, because of a corrupted leaf thereon, nor cut off a Limb of the Tree because of a withered bow on the Limb; but rather learn the Judgment of Wisdom and Righteousniss of the Lamb, in cases of sin and uncleanness, to stoop down and write with the finger on the ground, and when you have sufficiently written there; as the Lamb stooped down twice in the Judgement of the cause of the Harlot, then you will come to lift up the head also, (as he did) and say, Go thy way, and
sin no more; for by stooping down and writing on the ground, you will put many in the way, wherein they will sin no more; as the Lamb (your Example) did the Adulteress: And there you will be known to be of His Spirit, which taketh away the sin of the world, and not made as Instruments to the cutting off of souls from holiness and righ∣teousnesse, causing them thereby to turn into all sin and uncleanness; neither will the grief of the Just fall justly upon your heads, nor the sore distractions of the oppressed become your Burthens, but Peace will be with you for ever: But until this order of the Judgement of Righ∣teousness be throughly among you, God will make Whips for the daughters of Judah, and Scourges for the sons of Israel, and in mea∣sure chastize His People, until they are formed into the similitude of the brightness of His Glory, in the true Knowledge of His Judgements and Mercies, which go over all His Works; to be made a perfect Inheritance unto Him for ever, as He is their God, and their Per∣fection; But after Admonition upon Admonition, Reproof upon Reproof, if such a Person as is spoken of, stoppeth the Ear, and hard∣neth the Heart, and despiseth the Way of the Lord, and will not be Converted and Healed, after all the gentle dealings of the Spirit of your Father, and the Lamb in you: Then it will appear just and righ∣teous in any Sister or Brother, that is moved of the Lord in his pure and holy Fear, in the Spirit of Sobriety, to Judge the evil of such a one, in such severity as the Brother or Sister may be led unto by the Spirit of Widom to do; and so the Judgement will stand true and sound never to be repented of, for it will reach to that of God in all, in rela∣tion to Truth, both in matter, time and manner. And as this Order of Righteous Judgement is kept, so Peace will be also kept in Israel, and the Unity of Love in all his Tents for Ever. And be it known unto you, that Hastiness is not of the nature of my Father, who wooeth sinners, and correcteth gently in measure, and stirreth up his Bowels of Love and Mercies, again and again un∣to sinners, and often wooeth a stiffnecked and rebellious enemy, and win∣neth a treacherous soul by the power of his boundless eternal Love: Wherefore all that are born of the Seed of his Kingdom, must so grow into the Image and Similitude of their God, in his Spirit, of the glory of Love, Meekness, Long-suffering, and exceeding Tenderness unto one another, and unto all the Creation of Mankind, made of His mighty hand, as that their lives may shew forth the excellency of His Praise in their Generation, even to the End of their dayes in the Ta∣bernacle.
Again, in Cases of Trespasses of Brethren against Brethren, it ought to be looked into, whether the Trespass was of a presumptuous Will; & find∣ing it so, the Trespasser may wisely be dealt withal as abovesaid; but stil the Brethren in such cases must mind Forgiveness more than Judg∣ment: Because the exercise of Forgiveness, in the glorious Power of Love and Mercies, is able to overcome all the Trespasses, and the strong Will in all men which works Trespasses. Wherefore he that overcomes in this manner, gains Victory in the Battel of the Lamb, and so Conquers, as to receive the Crown of Victory on his Head; and also to see plainly, how the Vertue of Love in him, covers a multitude of sins and evils: And may not I say unto you all (without re∣spect of persons) if my Eternal Father of brightness, gave you the Example of the Lamb of His Glory, in taking away the sins of the World, ought not ye to be careful followers of Him in all His steps, pressing on in the growth of His Spirit, as much as in you lies, to do, as he did? And if He, in the Love of the Father, took away the sin of the World, whilst yet it was in enmity to the Father, and His own Life, ought not ye therefore, earnestly strive to be careful, in seek∣ing to remove the nature of a Trespasse from a Brother? And know you not that the most Forgiveness is a ground and cause, for the stirring up of the most Love? and if Love be stirred up in this Princi∣ple of Life, in the hearts of Trespassers, through the obtaining from you the abundance of Forgiveness, doth not this truly beget souls un∣to a nearness in God, who is the Original and Fountain of Eternal Love and Forgiveness? Surely yea; And therefore, this is Coun∣sel to you all, that you may be a pure and holy People to the Lord your God, Learn the Life of the Lamb, Follow Him wheresoever He goeth, and you shall never want Wisdom nor Counsel in the Way. And to the end that you may all bear in your faces the expresse similitude▪ and Image of the Father, mind the Word of the Lord to the Revolted People of Israel, who thus spake unto them by his Prophet, saying, As I live, saith the Lord God [who is pittiful, merciful, and long-suffering; slow to anger, but ready to forgive] I delight not in the death of a sinner, but rather that he might turn from his sins and repent: Unto which Repentance the Lord God of Grace hath often wooed (as I have said) perverse Rebels, which have wilfully resisted his holy Spirit, and sometimes hath smitten them with the Rod of his gentle Corrections, and then hath wooed them again, and said, All the day long have I stretched
out my hand to a gain-saying and rebellious People. And, Oh Jerusa∣lem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, How often would I have gathered thee as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, but ye would not? And which of us (this day in Sion) can say, but that our God sent unto our souls Line up∣on Line, and Precept upon Precept before we turned unto Him? and whilst yet we were sinners He loved us, and whilst we were Enemies, He prepared the way of reconciling us unto Himself; and whilst we were in our Blood He washed us; and when none eye pittied us His Mercies covered us: Now therefore if we should deal by our Brethren which have halted by the way, and not in the way of the dealings of our Father's love, mercies and compassions unto us whilst yet we were enemies unto Him; then should we degene∣rate from the brightness of the similitude of His Life, and be but as the sons of darkness in Judgement; for in the Eternal sweet Spirit of God I am sure that all Judgement out of the Life of this Testimony is but for a day of reproof, and also to be tryed in a day of Revelation by Fire; and therefore the merciful Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world, said, Judge not, lest ye be judged; because every tittle, out of his Spirit, is to be judged by his Spirit; since, in all Judgment besides it, there is a secret seed of prejudice and enmity in the heart, which stirreth up prejudice in the hearts of the persons judged; and such judged souls by shyness and strangeness kept at swords point, and at severe distance from Friends, hardens their hearts from God, which saves not, but destroys the soul: which is a sore weight to fall upon any spirit (viz.) not to be an instrument of Salvation, but rather of Damnation; which for ten thousand times ten thousand the price of all the Treasures of the Earth, I would not should fall justly upon my back through an act of the spirit of rashness, unless first I had exhorted, secondly admonished and meekly reproved; yea, after all this, if the person blameable should stand in obstinacy and perversness of heart against God, even until the last and utmost occasion of denying such a soul, I ought not to deliver such a one over, but for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. Again, All Friends must take serious and prudent heed how they take up matters upon slight reports; for that is but of the same which is ready to say, Report, and we will report: for such things will make Israel walk maimed in Counsel, and halt in Judgment,
and make him cast the simple in the ditch, and set the subtil to fly swift over fences. Wherefore, again I say, Be ye followers of the Lamb wheresoever he goeth; for he took the Testimony of many, before he judged the Harlots Cause in the seat of Mercy. And be ye careful to take the advantage of countenancing and cherishing the least appearance of Repentance and Contrition of heart in any revolted soul, turning not your ear from it, but nourish it and cherish it in all, that ye may appear as strength thereunto: And how know ye but that in so doing, ye may convert a sinner to God, and turn him from the evil of his way? And will you not know in that day that there will be more Joy in Heaven among the Angels of God, than for the other ninety and nine of the Flock, which never erred nor strayed from the Sheep-fold? And will not the sence of the Joy of God's Angels be a sufficient Crown of Reward unto you for so happy and blessed a work? Surely yea. And therefore my dearest Sisters and Brethren, look ye to your Father, grow in his Image, and walk with Him; and blessed shall your Day be unto you for evermore, Amen. I am your Sister in our Spouse; JOHN. Sent from Lyons in France, to be read by the Flock of the Lord every∣where: and not among the World, who pervert the Judgment of Truth. TOuching the fore-going Epistle I mention these few following words, for the prevention of the Worlds evil carping, and the exaltation of every spirit which hath erred, yet which hath seen the weakness of other per∣sons judging them, and not according to the true order of the Judgment of the Lamb of God: To the World I say thus, Though a few, in Zeal, have stepped forth in Judg∣ment, in a particular matter, somewhat beyond their
measures; yet because of infirmity in such a case are not to be cast forth, and that because of their Youth and Ten∣derness in the Truth, who in their this dayes birth, as new-born babes, have not yet attained unto the Perfection of that Wisdom, which is to be attained unto, but through Experience are growing more and more into the same. And to persons imprudently judged, this I also insert, That if they from a sence of this Admonition unto all, which reacheth unto such young and zealous souls in the Truth which have imprudently judged them, should rise up and seek to boast over them, they would by it bring themselves under the real Condemnation of the Spi∣rit, which gave utterance of the aforesaid Epistle, which only tends in substance for perfecting Unity, Peace and Love in God, which may never end. THE END.
