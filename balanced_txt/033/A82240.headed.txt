And for the maintenance of the Prote∣stant Religion, expelling all Poperie, and the subduing of all the enemies of the true Church of England. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Banks, 1642.
The valiant Resolution of the Pren∣tices of London. THe famous Citie of London hath ever beene fruitfull in noble and heroike Spirits, who have performed wonders of magnanimitie and valour in forraine parts, to the everlasting honour and glorie of their Countrey, and at home what a numerous Army, consisting of many expert and orishing Trained Bands can it produce? whose skill and courage equally marching together, doth with the ar∣tificiall thunder of shot, out the Heavens into a trembling amazement, and with the report thereof strike a terrour into the remotest Courts of Iupiter, though farther distant in the skies by many miles, than York from London. How therefore can any supposition of feare be grounded on any malignant partie now prevailing with the King to raise Armes in the North? the Papists so maliciously affected to the Protestant Religion, joyne with temerarious and rash Noble-men, in prosecuting a civill war. These gather unto them the decayed Gentrie of severall Countries, who ha∣ving by prodigalitie, excesse, ryot, and horse-races, run their fathers estates out of breath, thinks hereby to reno∣vate their estates, and unite themselves to the rest, to make their Forces stronger, add to those Delinquents and roring Cavaliers, who like Nero, would sing to behold, their Coun∣trey suffering in the martyrdome of a civill war, and with this heterogeneous confused Crew, decayed and indebted persons, are ranked together, with a multitude of drunken idle people, and giddy brain'd Gentlemen; and lastly, the ambitious Clergie, who that they may still have pluralitie of Benefices, use their tongues to sow dissention, and give
an edge to the Souldiers swords. All those, and many o∣ther sorts of persons, for their owne sakes and safeties; and to further their-owne penicious purposes, or at least to se∣cure themselves from condigne punishment, are all wil∣ling, under the faire pretence of defending the Kings right and prerogative, to joyne together in making one entire body of a civill war, and after the Siege of Hull, which is first attempted, to set the whole Kingdome in a combusti∣on, or inate the Countrey, besiege London, extirpate the Protestant Religion, introduce Poperie, so much desired by the Malignant Partie, and work such a lamentable Tra∣gedy, as was never knowne in any Kings raigne of Eng∣land. This storme, thus long a gathering in the Northerne parts, is ready now to fall downe in an impetuous showre of bloud: the Kings defensive Guard being multiplyed in∣to a great Army, collected and compounded of malicious Papists, rash unadvised Protestant Noble-men, decayed Gentlemen, indebted common people, doubtfull Delin∣quents, loose debauched persons, rattle-headed giddy∣brain'd Gentlemen, roring Cavaliers, and factious Clergy∣men, whose Sermons bid them ight for their owne prefer∣ment and glorie, not for the King and Gods glorie, though that bee made the colourable motive and occasion of the war. Now the wisdome of the Parliament and the Citie of London, seeing that the King will in hostile manner wound his honour and reputation, through his Subjects, and that their many petitions cannot prevaile with him, to dismisse those evill Counsellours of the Malignant Partie, but doth suffer them to put in action their owne plots and designes, under his royall name and standard, to the destruction of the Kingdome, the bertie of the Subjects, and the over∣throwing the privileges of Parliament, they with much un∣willingnesse being provoked and irritated thereunto, to vindicate their cleare intentions to the King, have raised Forces for the safetie of the Kings Majestie, the defence of
the Kingdome▪ the preservation of the distressed and be sieged towne of Hull, and in this Army by them, to thos just and legall ends levied, there are eight thousand brave-spirited young men, being all Apprentices, who deserve to be registred in Fames eternall Records; for seeing their Countrey is thus like to be engaged in a civill war, and that Poperie is like to be introduced in stead of Protestantisme, slaverie in stead of libertie, and a generall destruction indu∣ced into the whole estate of the Kingdome, are with much alacritie and cheerfulnesse resolved, to the utmost hazard of their lives, to oppose and resist the Malignant Parties Armie, consisting of Papists, and many others formerly mentioned. These martiall & valiant Apprentices that do thus expose themselves to danger for the good of their Country, to the qualities, conditions, and intents of the persons in the malig∣nant Army, for these Prentices earnestly desire the prospe∣rity of the Kingdome, and the honour of the King; and will truly with the best bloud in their bodyes maiintaine the true Protestant Religion, against the malignant enemies of the truth, carrying in their brests loyall hearts to their Country. King and Parliament, and intending their service onely for the safety and honour of His Majestie, and the glory of God, confident in good successe, marching on as cheerfull as if it were their marriage day, and that victor should be their happy Bride. Neither are they of the ba and mechanick scum of the people, who to support them¦selves in a riotous fashion, and to pillage the Country, un∣der the name of being Souldiers, doe without feare or any conscionable respect, take pay, and enter into service, but the greater part of those magnanimous Prentices, are ser∣vants to honest and sufficient Men, and by their owne ho∣nest laborious endeavours can be both serviceable and pro∣fitable to their Masters, and be very beneficiall to them, in working at their Trades, but their Masters preferring the publike good before their private profit & commodity, re∣sist
not the willingnesse of their servants, but do give them free and faire leave according to their owne desires, to do lawfull service to their King and Country, being perswa∣ded thereunto not through necessity, but animated with the noble desire of renowned honour. Neither are they loose idle fellowes that are faine to make war their profession, for want of other maintenance, for all these Prentices as was aforesaid, have Trades and Callings, and most of them young men of good parentage; whose friends live honest∣ly and thriftily in the Country, and yet as if they all de∣scended of generous bloud: their mindes are so enlarged, and their courages so magnanimously advanced, that no∣thing can contayne them from putting their Resolution in execution, and are determined by this their unexpected expresses of valour, in so young yeares to advance their owne fame, and bring honour and renown to the City of London. Besides these young sons of Mars, or Martiall Prenti∣ces, greeving to see how the King hath beene misled with false Counsellours to resist the loving loyallty of his Parli∣ament, and to raise forces in the North, in stead of a defen∣sive guard, they living here in London and being dayly eare witnesses of the Parliaments legall and just proceedings, and knowing to be the basis or foundation whereon the structure and building of the Common wealth must stand or fall, they perceiving now that through the instigation of the malignant party, those forces are levyed and levelled a∣gainst the Parliament, which is the defensive wall of the Kingdome, these noble minded Prentices, freely and volun∣tery offer their services to maintaine the Parliament a∣gainst the opposers therof, knowing the preservation ther∣of is in the power and prerogatives belonging thereunto, will conduce to the Kings honour, the Kingdomes safety, and the prosperity of the City of London. If therefore the end, moving to the undertaking of any action, deserve praise and commendations, especially the
necessity of the time requiring the sudden anxiliary forces be sent to oppose and stay the fury of civill dissention and the flame of a destructive war, breaking forth in the heart of the Kingdome, how ought the City of London to magnifie and applaud the hopefull stout Resolutions of these 8 thou∣sand magnanimous Prentices, that go to defend the Privi∣ledges of Parliament, against the Tyranny of an arbitrary government: these Prentices that march forth to preserve the Kings honour, and to prevent our owne misery, these Prentices that with unanimous and couragious hearts, go to succour the distressed Towne of Hull, and daunt the presu∣ming Cavaliers. And lastly, these Prentices that make their Religion the object and cause of their confidence, in main∣tayning whereof it may be sayd, Mors omnibus lcrum, death is a gaine to all, and in this cause, this quarrell thus animated, and thus resolved, these Heroick Prentices are now going forward to fight for Gods glory, their Sove∣reignes honour and the defence of the Lawes, and liber∣ties of the Kingdome, being led on by His Excellencye the Earle of Essex, in whom by his a stable and courtuous speeches, they do very much confide. And doubt not but under his prosperous conduct by the propitious favour of God, to behave themselves in such a valiant manner that it shall redound to the honour of the City of London, they having with many acclamations of joy acknowledged their willingnesse to some under His Excellence, desiring nothing but the prayer of this honourable City, for their happy and prosperous successe in this their noble Expedition and Reso∣.
The approbation of both Houses THe Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, be∣ing advertised by the Lord Lievtenant, and Deputy Lievtenants of the County of Essex, of their ready, full, and forward meeting of the Trayn-Bands of that Country; and of a cheerfull accesse, of a very considerable number of Voluntiers at their first appearing, Have thought sit to ∣presse unto them, the good sence they hold of their procee∣dings, so much conducing to the generall safety of this Kingdome; And having likewise received from them a Declaration full of affections, and good inclinations, to maintaine our Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and Privges of Parliament; Which they observe to be invaded by per∣nicious Counsell, as indeed they have beene of late, in a more dangerous and high manner than any age can paal∣lell,: And having very prudently observed in a right under∣standing, That the Kingdome, and the Kings authority, and Person, can be no wayes maintained, but by the upholding the Power and Priviledges of Parliament; as by the late Protestation they acknowledge themselves bound unto, a∣gainst all contrary Counsels, Power, and force of Armes whatsoever. This just and faithfull Resolution of theirs, to the publike good; The Lords and Commons do not one∣ly approve, but commend, assuring them, that as their en∣deavours have beene for the peace and happinesse of the King and Kingdome; So they will persist in charge of the great and publike trust, which lies upon them; to go through all difficulties which may oppose the publike peace and welfare of this Kingdome: And will upon all occasions be ready to expresse particularly, to those persons from who they have received such assurance of their affections and fi∣delities. FINIS.
