Antichrist's Government Justly Detected Of Ʋnrighteousness, Injustice, Ʋnreasona∣bleness, Oppression, and Cruelty; Throughout the KINGDOMES OF THIS WORLD; Wherein Antichrist hath had his Seat and great Authority for many Generations, in the Apo∣stacy from the Spirit and life of true Christianity. Shewed and declared, First, In the Case of Imposing upon Conscience in matters Religious, by force of outward Violence, or Pains and Penalties on the Persons and Estates of men, which is proved unrighteous and dangerous, and of Antichrist, &c. Secondly, In the Case of Heresie; shewing what it is in it self, who a Heretick is, who are the true Judges of it, and what Punishment pertains to such as are truly convicted thereof; and, That to Kill, Burn, Banish, or to punish Hereticks (as such) Cor∣porally, is of Antichrist, &c. By EDWARD BURROUGHS. LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, 1661.
THE EPISTLE DEDICATED To all the Rulers (of what de∣gree soever) in the (so called) Christian VVorld. O Friends! In the perfect Love of God Almighty towards your Souls and Bodies, and towards all Mankind; which Love is as a Fountain opened in my heart, & kindly issueth forth in Soul-breathing-desires of good, unto the whole Creation. In this Love (joined with an humble, meek and lowly temper of spirit) do I present this little quantity of substance unto you; not so much for your approof of my Work, as if I craved your License and Approbation for this small Piece to pass under your justificati∣on, (as is usually the manner of such Epistles thus directed;) but much more, for your serious and weighty considerations of the Cases (though briefly, yet truly) unfolded, which are things of very great moment to you; and wherein All of you, from the least to the greatest, are less or more concerned: And I do present this Work unto you as wholesome Advice, and good Counsel for you, (which ye ought ve∣rily to read and receive as such) rather then to flatter you by begging a Passe-port from you, that this may be read and received where it shall come; for the truth and verity of it, the weight of the matter contained, and the soundness of substance demonstrated, shall plead its own worth for acceptation in the Hearts and Consciences of all sincere men. The Truth and Verity, Weight and Substance of
Matter: I say, These Terms I may justly present this small Piece under the denomination of, unto you, and all the world. True it is, I do not study pleasing Stile, nor have I endeavoured to clothe and trim the Matter with flattery, curious tearms, words of man's wisdom, or some rare Method, that it might appear more in shew, than in real substance, (as the way of too many Writers hath been in such cases;) nor do I promise to please the Worldly Wisdom in men, by a delightful sound, so much as to answer the sincere Conscien∣ces of men by sound Truths, declared more in homely, broken tearms of speech, than in the rarity of Phrase, or well-compact∣ed Rhetorick; For I have always desired to be known and approved of God, and those that fear him, in sincerity, humility, and down∣right truth; and for this I study daily, and labour always, even to have praise, peace and comfort of God, rather than men, in what I am, and in what I do; and therefore 'tis my desire that ye would look beyond the Method containing, to the Matter contained, and that your eye may be onely fixed on the Substance intended, which is verily, and in truth, That ye may be informed the way of your peace and happiness in this world, and in that which is to come; and may never hereafter impose by force and violence in the matters of Faith, and the Wor∣ship of God, upon the Consciences of any, through penalties and punishments upon mens Persons and Estates, but that ye may allow and tollerate freely, Liberty of Conscience in all Religious Mat∣ters, and may not by cruelty destroy men in their Persons or Estates, upon the account of their being supposed to be, or if really Hereticks, and because of difference in Judgement and Practice, in Spiritual Matters. These are the particulars (for substance) held forth unto you, and all the world; and I have judged it most proper to direct these Ca∣ses to your view and consideration, as being the persons most chief∣ly (though not wholly) concerned: therefore blame me not, but ra∣ther receive my Love, though but little in quantity, yet real in quality, and that ye will find one day, when ye have truly tried the effects of the two Cases plainly laid before you, which are, Impositi∣on upon Conscience, and, Free Liberty of Conscience; These are the two Causes which will have their contrary and different effects upon all the Rulers in the world; Peace, Blessings, Prosperi∣ty and Happiness, are the effects of the one Cause; and Wars, Tribu∣lations,
Contentions, Misery, Sorrow and the Curse, are the ef∣fects which have, and will unavoidably follow the other Cause; and this ye will all find in the experience of Time and Transactions, com∣ing to pass in the world: And therefore I cannot but (in homely, plain words, as my manner is) assert the Causes, and the effects of the Causes, unto you, again and again, for the very end, to inform you, advise you, and warn you to follow the Good, and to forsake the Evil, to do the right, and hate the wrong, that the effects of Righ∣teousness, and Liberty of Conscience, even Peace, Love, Mercy and Prosperity, may ever be with you; and the effects of Cruelty and Oppression, and Imposition upon Conscience, which will be your misery, downfall and destruction (if ye continue in the Cause which works this Effect) may be turned away, and ye delivered. Wherefore O ye men, be advised, be warned; this is the day of the Lords dawnings; We have seen his Power and Glory; he hath wounded Us, and healed Us, he hath killed and made alive; he hath proclaimed Liberty in Our Souls and Consciences, from Death and Darkness, from the Grave and Hell; and he hath set his People free from bondage, to serve him with a pure and perfect heart; and if ye (mortal men, made of the dust of the ground, whose little measure of breath is in your Nostrils) will not approve of, and join with this blessed Work of the Lord, but shall gain-say his doings, and set your Power against his Power, and will not let the People go free in the exercise of their Consciences on holy performances, whose Con∣sciences God hath made free; then shall the Most High reward your op∣position with his Cup of Vengeance, and he will make you know he is the Lord against whom ye thus raise contention; and he will dissolve your substance, and bring down your glory, and subdue your pow∣er, if that (I say) ye oppose his Work, and will seek to bind and li∣mit his Spirit in his people, and wil yet force and impose upon Con∣science by outward violence, and kill, and persecute unto death, and banishment for matter of Conscience, and because of difference in Judgement in spiritual things; then thus it shall be done unto you, Ye shall fall, and perish, and be troubled, and blessings and prospe∣rity shall not be unto you. If it be not thus, the Lord hath not spoken by me. Well Friends, even all ye that have Authority and Power in the Government of this World, are nearly concern'd to take special no∣tice of these things presented unto you, seeing the Effects of these two Causes are both very weighty, and infallibly certain, even to you-
wards particularly: Very weighty, because Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, or Misery, Distractions and Downfall to you is depend∣ing upon the Effects of the Causes; Infallibly certain, because the Justice of God Almighty is such, that he must bring reward upon all according to their deeds, and his Justice cannot be diverted: But if ye permit free Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of godli∣nesse in Faith and Worship, unto all people under your Power, then shall Peace and Prosperity be unto you, according to the purpose of God: But if ye impose upon Conscience in any wise, by force in Religious matters, & will not be instructed and advised to the con∣trary, then shall misery and destruction certainly be unto you, accor∣ding to the Justice of God's Vengeance. These things are so, as a Ser∣vant of God I present them to you, and not upon fiction or fancy, but as I have received them from the Lord God, by his Spirit, which sig∣nifies the verity and certainty of these things in my soul. Friends, Doubt not of these things; for verily the time is at hand, and it must surely come to pass, my Spirit shall see it, and rejoice therein, if in this body I may not behold it, That imposing and forcing of Con∣science by Laws and Ordinances of Men, upon penalties on mens Persons and Estates, in Religious matters, shall be expunged, sub∣dued and abandoned in these Nations & Kingdoms of the world, and it shall be no more: But Liberty, Liberty shall be re-planted, embraced and renowned amongst men, and Truth and Righteous∣ness, Mercy and Peace, True Liberty and Freedom, Justice and true Judgement, with all the Causes and Effects thereof shall flou∣rish, and grow, and prosper on the Earth, and the contrary shall fall, and rise no more. This Day is drawing nigh, it's at the door, blessed are they that are prepared for it: Wherefore let all flesh hear and fear, bow and tremble; and let the hearts of the Righteous re∣joice and be exceeding glad; let all the upright in heart put on the garment of Praises and Deliverance; for the Day is at hand, that Antichrist (with all his Strength and Power, Force and Policy) shall be a hissing, and reproach, and shame, and contempt unto the Saints of the Most High, and amongst whom the Lord God Omni∣potent doth, and must Reign and Rule in Dominion, and Glory, and Power, over All, for ever, and evermore.

CHAP. I. Concerning imposing Religion; the Case stated, and the unrighteousness thereof shewed, with the danger thereof also made appear by manifest proofs. Presented to the RULERS and PEOPLE of our present Age, throughout the World. TO impose any kind of Religion, any way of Worship, or form of Faith, and outward conformity, in any practices of duty to God-wards, by an External Authority of men, through force of Laws com∣manding and requiring such conformity in Faith and Worship, upon pains, penalties and forfeitures on mens Persons and Estates, as hath been practised in the world since the days of the Apostles, among the Nations professing Chri∣stianity; This thing is not of the Lord, nor according to Com∣mands of Christ, and Examples of the Apostles and Primitive Chri∣stians, declared of in the Scriptures; but is of Antichrist, and un∣righteous, unequal and dangerous, to the destruction of the Souls and Bodies of both the Imposers, and the Imposed. For, 1. Such kind of forcing, & compelling by force of outward Laws, into such outward conformity of Religion, Faith and Worship, Church-Government and Ministry, was never in being nor ever practised in the true Christian Churches, amongst the Apostles in their days; nor ever was such a thing known among the Primitive Christians; There was no such kind of Laws made nor executed amongst
them, nor such force exercised on men's persons and estates in such cases; there was no outward violence used in the primitive times, to compell any to conformity to Christian Faith, Worship, and practice of Christian Religion; none of the first Christians were made truly Religious, and converted from the way of Error, to the way of true Christianity by such means of outward force and com∣mandments of men put upon them; They were not (I say) con∣verted themselves to the Christian Faith and Religion, nor made conformable worshippers of God in his Spirit by that way and means, nor did they seek to convert others into conformity to Church-Government and Christian Worship by force of outward Laws, upon pains and forfeitures; These things were not in the true Church of Christ in the Apostles days amongst the Primitive Christians. 2. But the true way of Conversion among them, to the Christi∣an Faith, and Worship, and true Church-Government, whereby peo∣ple were made rightly conformable to the true Christian Religion, as it was amongst the Apostles; was by and through the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ Jesus preached amongst them in the power and demonstration of the Spirit of God of such as were truly called and sent of him, which did turn people to the Spirit of God, and that Ministery wrought in them to receive it, by which their consciences were convinced, and their hearts perswaded in the love of Christ to believe in him, and receive him, and follow him; and thus were they drawn, and begotten, and converted into the Faith, and Worship, and Practice of the true Christian Religion, and made conformable to the Government and Order of the true Church of Christ, in all things, by this means; and were only, and not at all by any outward force and compulsion exercised upon them, converted to the true Christian Religion, and to the true Worship of God; and by the same way did they convert and turn others to the same; and this onely is the perfect way of Christi∣an Conformity to the true Christian-Worship and Church-Government; it ever was since the beginning of Christianity in the world, and is unto this day, even to perswade the heart, and to convince the Conscience inwardly by the sound Doctrine of the Gospel, through the operation of the Spirit of Christ, and by love, and meekness, and patience, and all the fruits of righteousness, held forth in Do∣ctrine and Conversation, which may answer the Testimony of God
in all mens Consciences: Hereby, and in this way is true Conver∣sion wrought in the heart, to the turning men from all Error un∣to the Truth, and from all false Worships, and Heresies, and evil wayes, unto the true Christian Worship, and conformity to holy Church and Religion: This (I say) was the way among the primitive Christians and Apostles of old, and is the same among the true Christians in this age; and they that would conform others, and are conformed themselves otherwise in this Case of Religion and Worship to God-wards, are not in the Example of Christ and his Saints, but out of the Life, and contrary to the first Christians, and president of the holy Scriptures, as hereafter is manifested. 3. The way and practice of imposing Religion, and Conformity in Worship and Church-Government, by Force, (as aforesaid) is so far from being according to the Practice and Example of the Apostles and the primitive Churches of Christians, that they are even con∣trary to the Commands and Exhortations of Christ and his Apo∣stles, and Example of the Scriptures: 1. As in the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares, Matt. 13. when it was desired of the ser∣vants, that they might go and gather out the Tares that the Ene∣my had sown, from among the Wheat; it was commanded to the contrary by the Husbandman, even that they should suffer the Tares to grow among the Wheat till the Harvest, and not pluck them up, lest they should hurt the Wheat thereby. Now though there be an invisible Mysterie of the Kingdom of Heaven secret∣ly signified in this Parable, more then may here be said; yet 'tis also clearly signified, that Christ would have no imposition nor violence used upon the Tares, nor that they should pluck them up by force, but that the good Corn and the bad should grow to∣gether in one Field till the Harvest. And thus much this Para∣ble bears the proof of: Suppose there be Heresies and Hereticks, and prophane persons that are not in the truth, but in errors, who are bad Corn, even as the Tares to the Wheat; in that Kingdom, City or Family where there is also converted Saints, and holy per∣sons, and true Members of Christ, who are as the Wheat to the Tares; yet such Hereticks and prophane persons that are in Error, ought not to be plucked up violently, to wit, Imprisoned, banish∣ed, and put to death, burned and destroyed from amongst the righ∣teous, though they grow amongst them, even in the same Field;
the converted Saints ought not (I say) to destroy by banishment or death, the Hereticks, and unconverted, and unconformable per∣sons from amongst them, but they are to let them live, even grow amongst them in the same Field, in the same Kingdom, City or Family, till Harvest. And thus much the Parable may truly signifie, even a liberty to live for the Tares, the bad Corn, the evil persons, among the Wheat, the righteous persons, without being imposed upon by cruel force and outward violence, to compel into conformity. 2. As in the case among the Saints and true believers, where some believed they might eat all things, others did eat Herbs; and some esteemed one day above another, and others esteemed every day alike, Rom. 14. Here was some difference in Judgement and Practice among the Believers, about Meats and Dayes (about which things there hath been much Imposition and Force used in the World since the Apostles dayes:) Well, but what doth the Apostle Paul do, and advise in this case? Doth he threaten violence towards any of them, or signifie any forcible commands or impositions to be used to bring them into conformity and unity in the things and matters about which they were divided? No, no; but this is his advice to the Church of Christ (of which he was a true and able Minister) Judge not one another about such things, nor do not impose any practice upon thy Brother; for to Christ Jesus his Master, every Believer stands or falls. And saith the Apostle, Let every man be fully perswaded in his own mind, ver. 5 And hereby 'tis manifestly proved, that in the Churches of Pri∣mitive Christians, the Saints and true Christians were not imposed upon by commandments of men, or outward Laws, in the mat∣ters of their Religion, and practice of Conscience; there was no signification of Force to be used for Conformity; but wholly con∣trary, even every believer had the liberty of the Spirit of Christ, and as he was by that perswaded in his own mind, to do, or leave undone in such cases, and every one was to mind the teach∣ings of the Spirit of Christ in himself, for to that he was to stand or fall, and not to impose upon another, no not so much as to judge his Brother in any case of difference in judgement or practise, but they were to leave one another to the perswasions of the Spirit of Christ in their own minds.
3. As in the Case where the Apostle exhorted the Saints to be like-minded, Phil. 3. But saith he, If any be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you; by which saying it is manifest, that the Unity and Conformity of Saints in mind and practice, was not by Imposition, or any outward force threatned or exercised upon their Per∣sons or Estates; but contrariwise, if there was any difference in mind and practice amongst them, that was to be amended, and Unity made up, when God revealed the same truth in all, as he had done in some; if any were not so minded in any thing as others were; they were not to be imposed upon, but let God reveal the same, and bring into conformity; this was the Apostle's Counsel: And ver. 16 Neverthe∣less, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule; that is to say, so far as the Rule of the Spirit of Christ is made mani∣fest, or in what measure the perfection thereof is attained unto, let every one walk in the same measure, and by the same Rule; and if any have not the self-same measure of the Spirit, and knows the self same things, let such alone, without imposing upon them, leave them to walk in the measure of Light and Knowledge that they have re∣ceived, though it be not the self-same measure that others have re∣ceived; and if they want any knowledge, or be in any thing other∣wise minded, God shall reveal the same unto them, even the same thing, as they grow in the same measure of Grace and Know∣ledge: And here is the perfect way of Unity and Conformity, as the Primitive Christians were exercised in the true Faith and Worship, and true Christian Religion in their days: And so to impose by Force up∣on pains and forfeitures in Religious matters, is clearly contrary to all these Scriptures, and to many more in the New-Testament. 4. In that case 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. where the Apostle exhorts the Elders to take the oversight of Gods Flock, not by constraint or force, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being Lords over Gods Heritage: Which clearly signifies against imposing upon the Flock of God, or forcing in Religious Matters; for ye see the El∣ders might not be constrained or forced to take the oversight of the Flock; neither (having the oversight of it) might they be as Lords over it, nor exercise Lordship over the Heritage of God, to wit, not command the Faith of any, nor impose by any force, in matters of Faith or Duty, nor oppress the pure Conscience of any, nor be as Lords (in any case) over the Heritage, nor use any Lordliness, or Master∣ship,
or Dominion, or Commandment by force, or imposing upon the Flock; this is clearly forbidden by the Apostle, and the contrary com∣mended; But be ensamples to the Flock, (saith he) feed them, win them, teach them, or oversee them, by good example, by love, as good Elders or Stewards over them, not as Lords, exercising any force up∣on them in rigor or bitterness; and this is the perfect way of Bishops, Elders and Ministers, overseeing the Flock of God, even to rule over, and oversee God's Heritage, walking before them as good Examples of humility, self-denial, and in all the vertues and fruits of the Spi∣rit of Christ, and feeding them hereby with the Word of Life, and that freely, not for filthy lucre, hire or rewards; and not ruling over them as Lords, imposing upon them, or exercising Lordship, by forcing and commanding such Faith, Worship and Duty, and imprisoning and persecuting for disobedience of such forcing, violent commands, as hath been practised in the World for many Ages, even Lordliness exercised over the Heritage of God, and the Ministers, Pastors and Elders have been as Lords over the Flock, and ruled by force and imposition, contrary to the example of Scriptures, and the Commands of the Apostles; and Love, Meekness, Gentleness, and good Example, have been neglected, contrary to the Apostle Peter's Instructions. Thus it is clearly manifest throughout the Scriptures, by many proofs, that the way of imposing Religion, and forcing into the con∣formity of Worship and Church-Government, in the dispensation of the Gospel, as aforesaid, is contrary to the commands of Christ and his Apostles, and the example of Scriptures, and is not of God, nor according unto him. And now I shall shew in the fourth place, of whom it is, and by whose Example this violence used, and persecution, unto Imprisonment and Death for, and because of Religion, and also the beginning of imposition by force amongst Christians. 4. All this Persecution practised about Religion, that hath been in the world, as Imprisonments, Banishments, VVhippings, cruel Tortures unto death, and grievous Affliction, hath been of the wicked one, through the Malice and Envy of the Devil, against God and his People in all Generations, even all that Persecution exercised towards the Prophets of old, before the coming of Christ in the Flesh, it would be too large to relate the particulars of it, as it is signified partly in the Scriptures, and chiefly in the Records of Transactions in their dayes; and I perceive it will easily be acknowledged by all, that
such cruel Persecutions were of the Devil. And again, in the days of Christ and his Apostles, how great was that force and impo∣sition by Persecution, practised upon the true primitive Christians, by the Jews and Heathens, even that Persecution which was inflicted upon Christ, his Apostles, and the Christians, was imposition and force exercised about Religion, though not so much for compelling them to any thing, as from that way of Righteousness and Truth in which they walked; they were commanded to preach no more in the Name of Jesus, and were imprisoned, banished, and greatly afflicted by the Jews (that great professing people) for, and because of their Religion; and this for the first and second Ages: I need not mention the particu∣lar proofs for this thing, 'tis so clear throughout the Acts of the A∣postles, and else-where, how the Primitive Christians were forced and imposed upon by cruel Laws, and violent persecutions for their Chri∣stian Religion sake; all which force and imposed persecutions, were of the Devil, out of his envy and malice raised up, and begotten in the hearts of wicked men, against God and his elected People; and this will be acknowledged by all. But 5. This way and practice of imposing upon people by force, and compelling them to conformity in matters of Worship and Religion, and all this persecution about the same, was never known in the world amongst Christians, nor practised by any called Christians, till the Apostasie, and falling away from the true Faith, which some did in the dayes of the Apostles, and many more afterwards; for even in the Apostles dayes some were gone out from them into the way of Cain that killed his Brother, and into the way of Balaam, that went for gifts and rewards; and these were Apostates from the true Church, and they were heady, high-minded men, proud, covetous, false accu∣sers, and such like, as Paul to Timothy expresseth; such as these were already sprung up in the first Age, and they grew more abun∣dantly in the second Age; and these were the Antichrists and false Prophets which John saw were gone out from the true Church, into the world, in his time; and these deceived the world by the form of godli∣nesse, and the likeness of Christianity, without the Power and Spirit of Christ; and the Apostates from the true Faith which were over∣spread in many Nations, and grown numerous, were the Sea and the Earth, out of which the Beasts arose, Rev. 13. And it was given to the Beast to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them, and they
that dwell upon the Earth should worship him; and he should CAUSE the Earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship; and he should CAUSE as many as would not worship the Beast and his Image, should be killed; and he should CAUSE all, both small and great, rich and poor, bond and free, to receive his Mark, &c. And this Beast was the Autho∣rity of Antichrist that arose among the Apostates and the false Pro∣phets, that thus CAUSED and compelled all to worship the Beast and his Image; Mark how often the word CAUSED is used in that Chapter, which is compelled or forced, and it was the Antichrist, the Beast that did it, the Authority that arose among the Apostate Christians that were gone from the true Church; and this was the first that we read of any forcing or compelling to worship, or persecu∣ting about Worship, and imposing about the same, since the dayes of the Apostles, through Ages, amongst them called Christians; and here was the beginning of imposing by force, and violent Laws, in the matters of Worship and Religion, amongst the People called Christi∣ans, and one Sect and sort according to its Authority, imposed by Laws and force upon another, causing, and compelling one another to worship and believe according to his Form and Image; and as any Sect of Christians hath gained outward Authority over others, that same hath caused and forced all others by outward violence into con∣formity to its own way and worship; and this hath been amongst the People called Christians, in the Apostasie, ever since Antichrist and his Power rose up amongst them; and thus, and at this time began first the imposing of Worship, and persecuting about the same amongst Christians: And thus 'tis manifest to be of Antichrist, and of the wicked one, and not of the Lord. 6. By what is said, it is plain, That all in this present Age who impose by force of Laws, and compell to worship and persecute about the same, are not in the example of Christ, or his Apostles, or any the good Primitive Christians, but in so doing are in the example of the Persecutors of the Holy Prophets, and in the example of the cruel Jews that killed Christ, and persecuted the Saints; and in the example of the cruel Heathens, that violently persecuted the Chri∣stians in divers Ages and Countreys, and are indeed of Antichrist, and of the Beast, that arose up against the Saints, and made war against them; and such are all they that do impose upon the Persons, Estates and Consciences of men at this day, upon the account afore∣said; and this is worthy of all mens serious consideration. And now
in the next place I shall proceed to shew how unrighteous and unrea∣sonable it is for any called Christians to impose upon the Conscience of others, and to force them by Laws and Commandments in the matters of Worship, and to persecute about the same. 1. It is unrighteous, because it is an intruding upon the Prerogative and Priviledge of God, and seems to be a derogating from His Honor Power and Dominion, which properly is in himself, and pertains to him alone, and not unto mortal man, which is to give Laws to Con∣science, and to exercise it in all cases of Religion respecting his Wor∣ship, Duty and Service, and to perswade mens Consciences by his Spi∣rit, to follow him, and observe all things which he requires in Faith and Worship: This Power is onely proper to God alone, and to him pertaineth, and to no other: And therefore for any man, or earth∣ly Powers of man, to give Laws and Rules to Conscience, and to im∣pose upon men in the matters of God's VVorship, forcing conformity in spiritual exercises, by violent commands, upon forfeitures and pun∣ishments, seems to be, and really is, an assuming and presuming upon God's Authority, which belongs onely to him, and tends to rob him of the same, and is an entrenching upon his Soveraignty, and and is wholly unrighteous, and inasmuch as it is a sitting in the Seat of God, and forcing the Exercise of VVorship, and intruding upon his blessed Priviledge, and a presuming into his Authority, which he commits to no man, a robbing him of his Honor and Spiritual Do∣minion: Therefore to impose in matters Religious, is unrighteous on their parts that do practice it. And 2. It is unrighteous because it is contrary to the Command of God, Do ye to others as ye would be done unto; but this imposing in matters of Worship, is a practise done by others, which others would not be done unto by any, and therefore 'tis unrighteous; for no one Sect or sort of Christians, would be imposed upon in that case by any others, not forced and compelled by outward violence, against their judge∣ments and Consciences, unto such a Conformity of Faith and Worship, to do thus is not to love a man's neighbour as himself, nor to do to all men, as men would be done unto; for if at any time and place the Papists (so called) impose upon the Protestants (so called) in this case, of forcing them unto Conformity or persecuting them about Religion, 'tis cried out against by such as are so imposed upon, to be tyranny, oppression, and exacting unrighteously; and thus every Sect
of Christians cries out against others, that do impose upon them by force, in things religious, contrary to their judgments and consci∣ences, each sort when they suffer saith of others, they are unrighte∣ous in such impositions, though many cannot see it to be unrighte∣ous in themselves, when they have the opportunity to do it, and doth impose upon others; but this is where self-advantage kills and choaks the witness of God, though however in it self imposing as a∣foresaid in religious matters, is contrary to the holy Law of God, and a doing to others as men would not be done unto by others, and there∣fore 'tis unrighteous, both before God and all just men. 3. It is unrighteous to impose worship by force, because it is an ex∣ercising dominion over men's faith, by force of outward power, which the Apostle renounces, and seems to forbid, saying, They had not do∣minion over mens Faith; and if the Apostles themselves had not power or dominion over men's Faith, that is to say, to command mens faith to believe, or do this, or the other, but as the holy Spirit of Christ perswaded their consciences inwardly; then no outward power of Kings or Rulers whatsoever, can justly or righteously cha∣lenge such priviledge as to have dominion over mens faith, by im∣posing upon them through force, which is to take dominion over men's faith, which is unrighteous, because it is contrary to the Scrip∣ture, and to the example of the Apostle Paul, inasmuch as it is exer∣cising dominion and lordship over the flock of Christ, and not leaving them to Christ the true Shepherd, who onely ought to teach his peo∣ple by his Spirit into all truth both of Doctrine, Faith and Worship; and hath not given power or authority to any Rulers of this world, to impose by force upon the consciences of his tender flock, nor to rule them in lordly dominion, exercising outward force upon them; but whosoever doth this, it is unrighteous. 4. It is unrighteous, in respect of the fruits and effects which al∣ways have, and ever will be produced by such imposition upon consci∣ence in religious matters as aforesaid, (to wit) persecution and cruelty of men exercised in that case, which ever hath been, and will be brought forth in Nations and Kingdoms where such impositions are; for if we look into Ages past, what strife and contention, what en∣mity and bitterness, what warrs and bloodsheds, what dangers and mis∣chiefs, what persecutions and cruelties have been brought forth a∣mong men between Kingdom and Kingdom, between City and City,
yea between Kings and their Subjects, between neighbour and neigh∣bour, between brother and brother, upon this very unrighteous occa∣sion of imposing upon conscience by force in respect of Worship; and every Nation and City at this day, is in the same danger of the same mischiefs, where such impositions are in force; and therefore needs must the occasion of these so unjust and unrighteous effects, which doth administer the reason of such contentions, warrs, persecutions and cru∣elties, be unrighteous, and such is imposing in matters religious as a∣foresaid: and this is partly manifest, and will be more and more through the world, That that Kingdom, City and Country, will not be free from these dangers and mischiefs, but will always be liable unto them, while this kind of imposition by force on the conscience is unremoved; and that which is the occasion of such continual pre∣sent dangers, to destroy Kingdoms, Cities and People, is unrighteous; and such is imposition in the matters of Worship and Religion. 5. It is unrighteous in any King, Prince, or Authority of this world to impose as aforesaid, because it diverts, confounds and de∣stroys the end of just rule and government amongst men one over another, which is onely to rule well in outward affairs, and over the outward man, to keep that in peace and good order, and to be a praise to them that do well, and a terror to all that do evil in their outward man, this is the onely end of Government and rule among men in this world, to rule well over the outward man in things between man and man; but not to rule over mens consciences, and to exer∣cise lordship over men in the spiritual matters of Christs Kingdom, this pertains not to the outward worldly government of men; and therefore whosoever do take it upon them, and thereby do oppress the conscience of any, by forcing in spiritual matters, doth un∣righteously, inasmuch as they do divert the end of their Authority, and use their power to another end then God hath appointed them; and while they should onely preserve and defend the outward man by good and wholesom Laws made for that purpose, they vex and oppress the inward man, even the conscience, by forcing upon it, and imposing through violence in the matters religious, which is contrary to the end of just rule and government in the world, and therefore is wholly unrighteous. 6. It is unrighteous, because it effects no good end, nor begets-people into the true faith and worship of God; but on the contrary makes
many Hypocrites, even through fear and terror; such Laws forcing Conformity, do make many hypocritically conform to such or such way of Worship, which the Spirit of Christ doth not perswade their Consciences of the truth of; nay it may be against their Conscience; and that (Imposition as aforesaid) which is the cause of this, is sure∣ly Unrighteous; unrighteous, because the End propounded by the Imposers (which is, to make people true Worshippers of God) is utterly frustrate and void; and none are made true Worshippers of God by such Imposition and Force, but many are made Hypocrites thereby, and sinners against God; for what any performs to God-wards by Force, and not of Faith (given into the heart by God) it is sin; For whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin, as saith the Scripture; and that which is the occasion of hypocrisie and sin, is unrighteous, and temptation; but such is imposing on Conscience by force in matters religious. 7. It is unrighteous and unreasonable to impose by force upon Con∣science, because it is the occasion of absolute extremity put upon many that are dear and precious to the Lord, even such an extremity as may force (unavoidably) the ruine of either Soul or Body (or both) in this world and hereafter. For, suppose such Laws be made for the forcing of conformity to command men to worship upon the forfeiture of whole Estate, Banishment or Death, which is contrary to the Spirit of Christ, and good Conscience: And if such Laws be not obeyed, and such Conformity made, but the Conscience kept clear to God, then the outward man in his Person, Estate and Family, is ruined in this world; and if such Laws be obeyed, and such Confor∣mity yeilded, contrary to good Conscience; then the inward man is ruined, and the Soul and Conscience wounded and grieved, because God is offended, and Christ is denied, and the Law of men obeyed, rather then the Law of God; and this is by an Extremity, occasion∣ed through imposed force in the cases of Conscience, by Authority and Laws of men: And that which is the occasion of such ruine and de∣struction to the Souls and Bodies of such as fear the Lord, is an unrigh∣teous thing, which administers that woful extremity, To deny God, and so to be liable to his Wrath and Judgements; or to deny the Au∣thority of men, and so to be liable to destruction of Person and Estate in this world; and such is imposing of Worship. 8. It is unrighteous and unreasonable, because it may destroy the faith of some, even of such upon whom Imposition is laid, against
their pure Consciences: For suppose a Person (or People) being truly perswaded by the Spirit of Christ in the true way of Religion & Wor∣ship of God, having therein true Peace with God in a clean conscience, and by force of Law, and through cruel imposition, should be forced from that way of Worship which they have had peace with God in, and which the Spirit of Christ perswaded them of the truth of, un∣to such a way of worship which they could not have peace with God in, nor the comfort of his Presence in such conformity forced upon them; this were certainly unrighteous and unreasonable, that a peo∣ple (or a person) should be forced by laws from that way wherein they have Peace and Blessings with God, to that way wherein their souls are famished for want of the Presence of the Lord: Like as if a person of such a Calling, following the same in a certain City or Town, whereby he maintained himself in all good things, and want∣ed nothing; and yet the chief Magistrate of the said City or Town, should forcibly compel (by violence) the said person of so good a Calling, from that his Calling, (whereby he so well maintained him∣self in the World) and should force upon him to follow another calling, of which he could not live in the World, but by it he might perish and starve; Would not all reasonable men conclude, the same imposition of the said Magistratee upon the said poor man, were Op∣pression, Cruelty, Unrighteous and Unreasonable: And the case of im∣posing Religion, as aforesaid, is the greater oppression and cruelty, in∣asmuch as it respects the immortal Soul, which is more worth then the Body; and the other respects but the Body, which is of less worth (with all that concerns it) then is the Soul, which is immortal. Lastly, 'Tis unrighteous inasmuch as it is contrary to the Scriptures (of the New-Testament in the dispensation of the Gospel) which are before-cited, and contrary to Christ and his Apostles Example in the Primitive Churches of Christians; and thus it is manifest, That impo∣sing by force upon Conscience in Religious Matters, is unrighteous and unreasonable, and is not of Christ, but of Antichrist, as by plain Reasons is demonstrated. And now I shall in a few words shew the danger of imposing VVorship as aforesaid; and how dangerous it is to any King, Prince, or outward Authority, that are or may be the im∣posers on the Consciences of men by force in the case of VVorship and Religion.
1. It is dangerous to cause the People to sin, to cause them to conform in appearance, when the heart is not devout to God; and this makes them Hypocrites: Dangerous to cause people to perform Duty to God wards, without Faith in God; and this makes them sinners against him, for whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin: Dangerous to cause some to deny Christ before men for the fear of this world, and the terrors of violent men, and to forsake that way which they know is of the Lord, and to follow that way which they know is not of him; and this is denying the Lord of Life, and a great abomination against him; and the cause of all this is, Imposing by force upon Conscience in matters Religious; and the reason of that cause is the Imposers, such as make and execute such force; and this danger all such are involved in, even the danger of causing people to sin against God, of denying Christ, of making Hypocrites, and so even in the danger of destroying souls, which is a desperate danger: Oh that all the Imposers of Religion by force, would consider it, and look upon the danger which they are deeply fallen into, and involved in, by reason of such their impo∣sing upon Conscience; alas, they are in the danger of destroying souls, of causing a Nation and a People to sin against God, and to deny the Lord of Life: And how great is such a danger even to be avoided of all, if they love their own souls, and not to be the occasions and cause of destroying souls by causing people to sin; and this danger all the Imposers upon Conscience are captivated in. And 2. It is dangerous to be a means to destroy that Kingdom, City or Countrey, and the Rulers therof, by begetting and nourishing Discon∣tents, Heart-burnings and Envying among the People one against another, and against their Rulers, because of such unrighteous Force and Violence exercised by imposition upon their Consciences: Dangerous I say, to raise into Contentions, Strifes, Broyles and Blood∣shed it self, in a Kingdom amongst People. And this is a danger vio∣lently impending upon such Rulers as do impose as aforesaid; even a danger to ruine their own Power and Authority, and to ruine the People under their Dominion, by raising the People into dis∣contents and broiles, through the cruelty of the Oppression of impo∣sing Religion, and the Example hereof may be read in Nations and Countreys at this day: What discontents and contentions have arisen dangerously among People one towards another, and to∣wards their Rulers, upon this Cause and occasion of imposing Reli∣gion
by force unrighteously; and 'tis a danger this day, that all the Rulers of the World are exposed unto, and deeply involved in, where this Cause of imposing Religion is extant in force. 3. It is dangerous to impose Religion by force, because it must needs produce Oppression, Persecution, Violence and Hatred, in the prosecution thereof; and this is dangerous to any Kings, Rulers, or Governors, to be reputed Oppressors, Persecutors, and violent men; this is infamous, and of bad report amongst men, and abomination and wickednesse in the sight of God, for any Rulers upon-Earth to be Oppressors, Persecutors and cruel men; and such consequently must they be that are imposers upon mens Consciences in Matters Religious: And this danger all the Rulers of the World are in, that do impose Religion by force, even to render themselves infamous by Oppression, in the sight of men, and to render themselves sin∣ners against God; and this danger falls upon the Imposers of Reli∣gion, because of such their Impositions by Force upon the Conscien∣ces of men. Lastly, 'Tis dangerous because 'tis of Antichrist, and not of Christ, as before proved; and all that do impose by violence on the the Consceences of men in Religious Cases, are of Antichrist in so doing, and because thereof, liable to God's indignation and heavy wrath in this world, and hereafter; and 'tis dangerous to bring the Wrath and Judgements of God upon men that are guilty thereof for God will be avenged upon such his Enemies that exercise Vio∣lence and Persecution upon men for their Conscience-sake: And This is a danger unavoidable, which all that impose Religion are liable unto, even to be cut off in the wrath of the Lord, and to undergo his Indignation for all the reasons before-shewed. These, with many other dangers are they involved in, that are imposers in religious matters: Therefore, Oh that the Rulers of this world would be wise now in their last day, and would consider the unjustness and unreasonableness of their imposing Religion, and the many dangers that attends the same. Oh that they would learn God's Counsel, and rule only for him in Justice, Mercy, Truth, Equity and true Judgement, exercising the same in the meek and lowly spirit of Jesus, among men, and over whom they are set to rule in this world, and would give to God Almighty his Due, and Right, and Priviledge, in exercising the Consciences of men by his
Spirit, in all cases of Christ's Kingdom; for it onely belongs to Him to be Ruler in the inward man. Oh that the Rulers of this world would give this Power and Dominion unto God, and would from henceforth never more exercise. Lordship over Conscience, by im∣posing Religion through force, but would onely rule well over the outward man in the things pertaining to man, and would leave to God the rule and exercise of Conscience; Oh! then would it go well with them, and happy and blessed should they be in such their Authority, and peace should be unto them, if that they onely took the Government, (as appointed of God) over the out∣ward man, and did not impose upon the inward man by force, in re∣ligious matters, but committed that Authority to God: Then I say, should peace and blessings be unto them: But while it is other∣wise, even while they exercise Dominion and Lordship over Con∣science, as aforesaid, they do unjustly and unreasonably, and brings upon themselves many dangers, and are liable to contentions, op∣positions, wars and many mischiefs in this world, and to the anger and wrath of God in the world that is to come. CHAP. II. Concerning Heresie, the Case stated. What it is in it self, and who a Heretick is, and who are the absolute true Judges of it, and what punishment pertains to such as are truly convicted of Heresie. 1. THere is such a thing as Heresie in it self, even many Heresies & Errors abounding among the sons of men in the world at this day; and there was Heresie in the dayes of the Apostles, and amongst them, brought in by such as erred from the truth,
after they had once known the Truth, and received it; as ye may read, the Jews they cried out of Heresie in their time, which caused the Apostle to say to them, Acts 24.14. After that way which ye call Heresie, do we worship the true God of our Fathers. And the Apostle said (1 Cor. 11.) to the Church, There must be also Heresies amongst you, that they that are approved of God, may be made manifest. And (2 Pet. 2.1.) it is spoken of some who should privi∣ly bring in damnable Heresies into the Church: By all which it is manifest, there was in the Apostles dayes Heresie and Heresies, as there is at this day, even many Heresies and Errors in the world, held, professed, and maintained by the Apostate Christians that are gone into the form of godliness, without the power, and are turned from the Spirit of Christ, and the soundness of his Do∣ctrine, into the formal profession of Religion, and of the words of Christ and his Apostles, and among such are the Heresies and Errors. 2. Heresie is somewhat believed and professed in practice of Worship, and in point of Faith and Doctrine, that is either con∣trary to, or different from the perfect Truth of the Gospel of Christ; something (I say) held and practised in point of Wor∣ship, Faith and Doctrine, which is not justly according to the pure Truth of Jesus, but either in whole, or in part, different from, and contrary thereunto; and whatsoever practice of Worship, or point of Doctrine, as is so held, professed, believed or practised, is He∣resie and Error, because it is different from, and contrary to (in whole or in part) the perfect Truth of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, and because thereof it is Heresie; and such is Heresie in it self, different from, and contrary unto the Gospel of the Kingdom of Christ, though as for the particular parts and points of Heresie in Worship, Doctrine and Practice, which are at this day held, pro∣fessed and believed among Apostate Christians, are so very many, that they would be too large here to ennumerate; but my pre∣sent intention is onely this, To shew at large what Heresie is in it self, and who is a Heretick. 3. A Heretick (one that is properly so) is such a person as hath sometime believed in the Truth, and made profession and acknowledgement of the way of true Christianity, and hath re∣ceived and held the true Faith of the Gospel of Christ, and been
in some measure united to Christ, and a Member of his Church, but is fallen and degenerated in whole, or in part, from the said Faith and acknowledgement of Christ Jesus, and the way of Christiani∣ty, and hath erred from the truth of the Gospel once believed and received, and so is divided (in whole or in part) from the true Church of Jesus Christ, and from being a Member of the same; and not onely so, but hath received also, and doth hold some false Principles, Opinions and Practises, either different from, or contrary to the truth of the Gospel before believed in, known and professed; such a man is a Heretick, (though generally, yet) truly described: Not such as are Heathens unconverted, who never believed yet in the Gospel, such who have alwayes resisted the Truth, and never yet were convinced of the way of the Lord, nor ever tasted of his Word and Power, but have always been strangers to the Israel of God, and Enemies to the Church of Christ; such are not properly cal∣led Hereticks, though they do err in mind, heart and practice; but such onely as have believed in Christ, and professed his Truth, and been of the Church, and yet are fallen away from the perfect truth, into some false principles and practices, and are become unsound in Judgement, and erroneous in their Understandings, and have forsaken the way of Truth (in whole, or in part) and are corrupted, and lost their Love to God and his wayes, and are obstinate, and har∣dened against the Truth (which once they believed) and with false Doctrines, Principles and Practices, do gain-say and oppose the Truth, and them that are steadfast in it: These are Hereticks, and truly so called; Men that have erred from the Faith, that have made ship-wrack of it, and of a good conscience, that are turned against the Lord and his People, and gain-say the Truth that once themselves have believed & professed: These are erroneous men, and Hereticks, & such Hereticks there were in the Church, & among the Corinthians; and there were such who did creep into the Church, and privily brought in Heresies amongst them, as before is proved; And these Hereticks were such as had once been amongst the true mem∣bers of the true Church, and been convinced of the true Jesus, and had sometimes walked with them, but were departed from them, and had forsaken the Truth, and received false Principles and Opi∣nions, and therefore they were truly nominated Hereticks; and all such at this day are truly so called: And this is the Description in general, of a Heretick.
4. Now I come to declare who are the true Judges of Heresie, and Hereticks: Not every man can judge in this case in his own thoughts, imaginations and suppositions, who are Hereticks, and who are guilty of Heresie, though it hath been the practice for many generations amongst the Apostate Christians to reproach, traduce and accuse one another to be Hereticks, and each sort and sect of false Christians, to judge, censure and condemn others that are not of their Judgement and Opinion, but different from them, to be He∣reticks and Erroneous; and this hath been usual among many; but this is not the true Judgement, nor the way to try and judge truly who Hereticks are, by one sect and sort slandering and and accusing others to be such, because they have not conformed to their Way and Principles, but been different from them; true Judgement hath not been brought forth in this case, on this wise, but rather Envy and Enmity hath judged, and men's thoughts, imaginations and jea∣lousies hath falsly judged in this matter, and no sound judgement de∣termined who have been Hereticks; for men have judged of one another by their private jealousies and evil conceivings, and censu∣sured one another to be Hereticks, without the Spirit of sound dis∣cerning, and just Judgement; and all that Judgement brought forth in that case, without the infallible Spirit of Christ Jesus, which is onely true Discerner and Judge in the matter, hath been false Judge∣ment, and men hath judged one another falsly upon envy and evil suppositions, and without the Spirit of the Lord; and it hath often happened by reason hereof, That such so judged for Hereticks have been more righteous, and more in the truth, then they that have so judged them; and the Judges have been more out of the truth, and more Hereticks themselves, then they whom they have falsly judged: And this might be made appear through several Times and Ages since the Apostles dayes, among the false Christians. 5. None are able to discern of Heresie, nor to try and judge justly who are Hereticks, none but they (I say) that have the infal∣lible Spirit of God in them, to guide them, and have infallibility and perfect certainty of Judgement and Knowledge in that case of Here∣sie; none else are rightly able to judge who are Hereticks, but such (I say) as have the infallible Spirit of Christ, and are infallible and certain in their Judgements; These onely, and none else, are able to judge, they onely are competent Judges in this case of Heresie, and
who are Hereticks; and if any judge in that Case, it is but out of Envy and Enmity, and in the evil Suppositions and Conceivings, as aforesaid, and must needs be false and unjust Judgement, if they have not the infallible Spirit of God, and infallibility of Judgement to discern by, and determine with in that Case; for no man nor men, may, or can justly judge another in the matter of Heresie, as a Heretick, by their own thoughts or suppositions, out of their en∣mity, and for their self-Interests; but the Judgement in that matter must be just, equal, holy and true, and onely by the Spirit of Christ Jesus which is infallible, and gives infallibility of judgement and dis∣cerning into all cases and things; for it was Christ Jesus and his A∣postles, and the Saints that had the infallible Spirit of God, and in∣fallibility of judgement, that could onely judge justly of such things, who were Hereticks, and who were not; and it was not the Jews nor Pharisees that could justly discern or judge in God's Spiritual mat∣ters; but they alwayes judged of Christ and his Apostles, and of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, falsly and unjustly in their evil suppositions and envy; and this was because they had not the in∣fallible Spirit of Judgement, nor the certain, infallible knowledge and discerning of different things in spiritual Cases; and so it is now at this day amongst them called Christians; there is none can discern truly, nor judge justly what Heresie is, nor who is a Heretick, but such as are guided by the infallible Spirit of God, and have infallibility of Judgement; nor none can make Laws whereby justly to judge of Heresie and Hereticks, but them who have the same infallible spirit of God guiding them, and have received infallibility of Judgement: So both the Law-makers, and the Judges of the Law, must be in∣fallible in knowledge and judgement in this case of Heresie, otherwise the Law made for that purpose, and the Judgement given by that Law, are both false and unjust, and not according to God and his Spirit, but are to be justly judged and condemned of the Lord God, in his day and season. 6. Now it remains to be enquired into, whether there is any punishment pertaining to Hereticks as such, for such Heresies held by them: Being first convicted truly thereof, as aforesaid, by the true Church of Christ, in whom there is infallibility of judgement, knowledge and discerning in that case; for in the true Church of Christ doth infallibility of true Judgement and Knowledge dwell, and
every true Member of the true Church, hath its particular measure of the infallible Spirit of Christ, whereby he is certainly perswa∣ded of the way of Truth in which he walks, and knows and be∣lieves the infallibility of the Truth he professeth, and is certain and secure of the way of his peace and assurance in God, which he hath received and believed; and also hath certainty and infallibility of judgement, and discerning who are out of the Truth, and in the way of Error, and are Hereticks; such are infallibly known and discer∣ned by the Spirit of God in the true Church of Christ, and by every Member of the same, according to his measure of the same Spirit and Gift of Knowledge and Discerning by it: And to such as are so convicted by the infallible Spirit of Christ for such their Heresies, there is a Punishment pertaining; for Hereticks were to be punish∣ed in the Apostles dayes, according to Paul's Instructions, 1 Cor. 5.5 which was, That such a one as had erred from the Truth which once he knew, should be delivered up unto Satan for the destruction of his Flesh, that the Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord: Here vvas a punishment described by the Apostle for this Heretick that had er∣red and gone from the Truth, and acted against it, though once he believed in it, and knevv it. And again Tit. 3.10. he exhorts and advises, That a man that is a Heretick, after the first and second admonition should be vvholly rejected, and turned avvay from, and judged vvith the Holy Spirit of God. And thus it is clear, there is such a thing as dealing vvith men that are Hereticks, and punishing them for such their Heresies, ac∣cording to the Apostle's Doctrines and Instructions: And vvithout all controversie, such as do err from the Faith vvhich once they have received, and turn from the Truth in Principle or Practice, must not escape unpunished, but must receive the sentence of just Judgement from God, and from his Saints that continue faithful. 7. But what kind or nature this punishment is of, in what way and manner such as are Hereticks, may be, and ought to be punished, is doubtful to many, and is a case at this time to be enquired into; for that way and practice of punishing such as have been supposed to be Hereticks, as among the Christians (so called) for many generations; (to wit) the way and practice of burning, banishing, killing, imprisoning and afflicting corporally the persons of them that have been called Hereticks for their he∣resies,
and laying forfeitures and penalties on their bodies and e∣states, as hath been the practice of Papists and Protestants towards one another since the Apostles days, this way and practice hath not been of God, nor by any example or precept of the Apostles, or first Christian Churches established in their days; they did not practise or prescribe such dealing towards them that were truly Hereticks, and were erred from the faith and truth of Jesus Christ; not killing, burning, banishing and prosecuting the persons of Here∣ticks, this was not the way of the Spirit of God among the primi∣tive Christians, they did it not, nor gave institution for the doing of it at any time; but this way of dealing towards Hereticks, in such cruel proceedings as hath been in practice for many ages, is of Satan and Antichrist, and is downright murder, robbery, and wic∣kedness in the eye of the just God; while one sect or sort of Chri∣stians (so called) have punished and enviously persecuted another sort different from them as hereticks, with grievous afflictions in body and estate, even unto death and banishment, this hath not been of God, nor true Christian-like, but of the wicked one, and cruelties and murders before the Lord; neither is the same proceedings at this day, in any part of the world, where they are extant, any just, legal, righteous, Christian-like way of proceedings according to Apostolical example; but is of Anti∣christ, and of the wicked one, as I have said; And this way and practice of proceeding towards hereticks, hath been so far from ef∣fecting the return of any to the way of the Lord that have been erred from it, (as the end of proceeding towards hereticks should ef∣fect) that the way and practice of killing, banishment and persecu∣ting by violence, hereticks (so called) hath hardned men in their evil way, and made such as have been hereticks more bold, confident and obstinate in their way, heresie and errors, and ma∣ny that have been more righteous, and clearer from heresie then such as have so judged them, have been destroied by cruel dealing, and many others have been destroyed in their iniqui∣ties and errors, by being so proceeded against; and thus true judg∣ment and justice in this case have been perverted and turned backwards, and because of ignorance and cruelty, the righteous have suffered unjustly as the wicked, and the wicked have suffered by unjust proceedings, and thus the way of righteousness hath not
been known in the Earth, but error upon error, one evil upon a∣nother hath come to, one sin added to another amongst the sons of men in the Apostacy amongst the false Chri∣stians. 8. But the perfect way of the Lord in proceeding towards such as are truly Hereticks, so discerned and infallibly judged to be by the true Church of Christ, is this; Let such first be admonished, advi∣sed, instructed and warned again and again; to beware, return from, and renounce such false principles, doctrines and practices held by them, and this in the Spirit of Christ Jesus in perfect love, and in meekness, and in the wisdom of the Lord God; such, I say, as are erred from the way of the Lord, and from the faith of Christ once received, into error, ought thus in the first place to be dealt withal, by the way of admonishing, instructing, warning and reprov∣ing, that there may be a returning and repentance towards the Lord and his truth again from whence they have erred; And if such shall not receive the instructions, reproofs and admonitions of the true Church of Christ, then such hereticks shal be rejected and cast out, according to Titus the 3.10, 11. saith the Apostle, A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second admonition, reject, knowing that he that is such, is subverted and sinneth, being condemned of himself; here is the description of the punishing of an heretick: If he will not receive admonition after being given him again and again, but doth harden his heart against the Church, and against the truth of Christ, and will not repent, but persists in his errors and heresies, and that after reproof and admonition, then he is to be rejected; rejected, what is that, but a casting out from the unity of Saints, a departing and absenting from such an one, and a depriving of him of the peace and comfort, joy and felicity of the Assembly of God's people and servants; a turning from such in Converse and Fellowship, and a separating from them, and judging them by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, and this is rejectiag an Heretick, and delivering him to Satan, according to 1 Cor. 5 4, 5, 6. When the Church (the Saints) were met together, with the Spirit of God, and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, such an one as had erred from the truth, and sinned against it, and was truly an Here∣tick, should be delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit might be saved; Delivering unto Satan, what is that? but
to let him be cast out into the wicked world, reputing him as such an one, and that he partake not of the sweet and blessed union and fellowship of Saints in their Assemblies and con∣verse with the God of heaven, in his Spirit and Life; not to be numbred among the righteous, nor a partaker with them in the holy Union of the Elect; to pass judgment upon him e∣ternally, in the estate he is now in, having both erred from the truth, and rejected and despised the reproofs and admonitions of the Church of Christ, and as such to give him up to Satan, to give him up to that Spirit that hath led him aside from the Truth, and hardned his heart against it; to deliver him up to it, seeing he refuseth to be reclaimed from it, and hath chosen to follow it rather then the Truth, let him be left unto, delivered up unto that Spirit, even unto Satan in the wicked world, let him be cast out thither among the unclean, and not reckoned among the record and line of the faithful people; and separated from, and cast out so, as he expresseth it, vers. 11. If any man that is called a Brother be a fornicator, or covetous, a rayler, a drunkard, &c. with such an one not to accompany, no not to eat: and this is to deli∣ver a Heretick to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, and is the proper punishment of Heresies and Hereticks, according to the Apostles advice and precept; but not to kill or punish the persons of men by corporal afflictions and penalties, on bodies and e∣states, for their errors sake, this the Apostle gives no Commission for, but that such as erred from the Truth, and walked contra∣ry in principle or practice, should be rejected and delivered up unto Satan, in the way and manner as before declared. Again, in Matth 18.16, 17, 18 it is signified by Jesus Christ to the self-same purpose, in these words, If thy Brother trespass, go and tell him alone; if he repent, forgive him; if not, take one or two or more with thee, and tell him again: If he still neglect to hear, tell it to the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let such a one be unto thee (as hath offended and rejected reproof and admonition again and again) as an Heathen man and Publican: In which words of Christ is truly signified the right and proper way of proceeding towards Hereticks and Offendor, even that they be first again and again ad∣monished and reproved; and if they resist the same then to be cast out, separated from, and not enjoy the union and comfort of the
Saints amongst them, but as an heathen man and publican; but here is never a word signified of laying corporal punishments, and burning or banishing of persons for their Errors sake; and though they may offend, no proceedings of this kind are authorized by Jesus Christ or his Apostles in their day, but in another way and manner, as I have shewed, is the proper way ordained of God to deal with Hereticks, according to the Testimony of holy Scrip∣tures, signified by Christ and his Apostles in the Primitive Chur∣ches. 9. This is punishment according to the nature of the offence; for as the offence is spiritual, erring in the mind from the Truth, and a going astray from the Spirit of Christ in a man's own parti∣cular; so the punishment is answerable thereunto, even to be sepa∣rated from the Truth, and not to enjoy the virtue, peace and com∣fort of it, nor to be partakers thereof amongst the faithful peo∣ple: And this is truly according to the Justice of God, whose ways are just and equal altogether, and hath appointed just rewards for transgressors, according to the nature and merit of the fact and deed that is evil; and 'tis righteous and just that men that sin against their own souls, should be deprived of the peace and comfort there∣of; that all that do depart from the Truth once known, and sin against the knowledge thereof, should be no more a partaker of the virtue and felicity of the same; and that they who offend the Lords people, and revolt from the union thereof, should be cast out from them, rejected of them, and not enjoy the blessings and peace with them; even that all they that will not hear the reproofs of the Spi∣rit of God, nor be drawn with the gentle movings thereof, should be judged and condemned with the same, and not inherit the assu∣rance of the Saints: And this is God's Justice, That all that love Evill, and walk in Iniquity, and despise the Lord, should be cast out into the sinful world, to have their portion with the ungodly, and all the workers of Iniquity; and this is just punishment according to the nature of the Offence of Error and Heresie: for in my Judge∣ment, (and I have the Spirit of just Judgement in this Case) It is great puishment, and sufficient for a man that hath once tasted of the virtue of Gods Presence amongst his People, to be cast out from the feeling and enjoyment of that life, virtue and Assembly where it is enjoyed; this is punishment, and a wound to the Soul and Consci∣ence,
for a person that hath been turned from Iniquity, and witnes∣sed the peace of Christ in the Church, to be left in iniquity▪ and to witness the wrath and anger of God daily smiting him in his spirit, and upon his heart; this is indeed great punishments: And to have the holy Spirit of Christ in his people (now) to judge and condemn him, whom sometime it hath comforted and refreshed; and to be dis∣united and separated from that Spirit and Power amongst the Saints, which once gave life and joy amongst them. This man thus judged and condemned by, and thus separated and dis-united from the Spirit and Power of Christ and his People, is punished and afflicted suffici∣ently for his Error and Heresie; even in his Conscience, Soul and Spirit, he is wounded, grieved, pierced, vexed and punished, though yet his outward man, and his person be not corporally afflicted by punishments; but he is afflicted within, he is dealt withall by the an∣ger of God in his conscience, he is separated into darkness, and from the light and glory of God in the Assemblies of his People; he is at a distance from the Lord God, and the spirit which should comfort him, doth daily vex and judge him; and the people amongst whom he should be saved, is he separated from, and cast out to Satan; is now amongst the sons of Belial, the children of wickedness and ignorance that must be condemned: And this man is now rejected of the Saints, that once was embraced of them, and thus he is punished; for it is the greatest punishment and vexation for a man that hath once tast∣ed of God's love, mercy, peace and blessings, amongst God's people, and to be forsaken of God, and without his love, in his anger, in his judgement, and in the curse, amongst the wicked, without peace and blessings amongst the Saints, this is punishment indeed, from which the Lord deliver all his people that fear him. Yet notwithstanding this kind and manner of punishment per∣tains to Hereticks as such, most properly, and not to be destroyed in person or estate by outward penalties; this I only mean and intend, Where the Error of a man, and his Heresie in his mind and judge∣ment doth onely extend to the hurt of his own soul, and against God, and not to the harm of his neighbours person or estate, in that case he ought onely to suffer as before-mentioned, To be delivered up to Satan, and to be rejected, &c. But if his Error and Heresie do extend further than onely against God, and his own soul, even to the wronging, in uring and defrauding of his neighbours person and
estate, and outward wrongs, or evils, or violence, or visible mischiefs be committed, as Murders, or other the like visible crimes against men, to the injuring of others, then I forbid not outward external punishments to be corporally afflicted upon the person and estate of such a man; but it ought to be done, and that by Laws of men pro∣vided for the same end; even such a mans Error in such his wrong dealing, may justly and lawfully be punished with death banishment, or penalties, according to the deserts of the crime, if his sin and er∣ror be against men, let men deal with him, and punish him accor∣dingly: If his offence and error be onely against God and his own soul, let God deal with him, and punish him by his wrath in his con∣science, which one day will be executed upon all that err from the Truth, and tribulation and anguish shall be upon his soul that doth evil, as it is written: But it is utterly unlawful, and sin against God, for men to kill, burn, or banish men for the error of their minds and judgements in spiritual matters, while they do walk justly and truly (as men) in the things pertaining to men, and are not inju∣rious to the persons or estates of any, by reason of such their Er∣ror, but they onely sin and err against God, and their own souls, to the hurt thereof, and not man, by any outward punishments or vio∣lence executed upon their persons, but God and his people in the way and manner of the spirit of Christ, as afore declared, ought for such their Errors and Heresies to deal with them, and proceed to∣wards them in respect of punishment for the same. Lastly, These things are but said in general concerning Error and Heresie, how they are to be judged and punished, and by whom, and to manifest that there is Error and Heresie, Hereticks end erroneous persons in the world; for (as I have said before) it was not now my work to ennumerate the particular parts of Errors and Heresies, that are held in Principle, Doctrine and Practice, in the world at this day, they are so many and large; but yet more parti∣cularly, thus I would in brief define Hereticks and Heresie. That man (whatsoever he be) is in Error in all parts of his Principles and Pra∣ctises, held and maintained by him in point of Religion and Worship of God, especially that is not perswaded of the truth and verity of his way by the holy spirit of God, and led, guided, and taught in the performance and practice thereof, by the same Spirit of Jesus; if the holy spirit of God dwell not in him, and doth not perswade the
heart in the belief of the Truth, and teach, and lead the man in the practice of it, such a man, even that man errs, and is in Er∣ror in all what he is, and what he doth, in point of Religion and duty to God-wards, and that because the Spirit of Truth and Righ∣teousness is not the onely Leader and Teacher in the things profes∣sed and practised, but either tradition, example of others, or custom of places and times, or something else besides the Spirit of God, which onely perswades into the belief of truth, and teacheth into the performance of the same, and thus is distinguished and known: A man in error, that is erronious in his Faith and Practice, if not taught and perswaded by the Spirit of Christ in what he is, and in what he doth, he is in error, and in a degree of Heresie, erring in mind and judge∣ment and conscience, in principle and practice, and subject to err in all things: Now as for the case of Error and Heresie, as the matter hath stood (in distinguishing of Hereticks and Heresies, in judging of the same, and in proceeding with Hereticks in the manner afore∣said) for many generations in the Apostasie since the Apostles days, all this hath been wrong, and not in the Spirit and Power of Christ Je∣sus, but men, cases and proceedings, all have been perverted from truth in that matter, because the spirit of darkness and ignorance hath ruled (and not the Spirit of God) in the hearts of men; and the Spirit that is not of the Father (which Spirit of the Father is onely pure, perfect and infallible, because it is of God, and can truly judge and determine in these cases) hath been Lord and Judge in this mat∣ter, and men out of their envy and hatred one towards another, have judged one another to be erroneous and Hereticks, & proceeded against them thereupon; and such as have differed in Judgement or Opinion one sect and sort from another, and would not conform to one another in their ways, practises and Religion, it hath been com∣mon for all different sorts of men to cry out one upon another, and against each other, Heresie, Heresie, Hereticks, Erroneous persons, and the like, and proceeded against one another, men against men differing from them, and sect against sect contrary to it self, and especially that sect or sort of people that hath had the Government of Nations and Countreys in their power, could, and hath easily proceeded against all others dissenting, upon the recount of Er∣ror, to the destroying of many, absolutely through envy, hatered and prejudice, and not upon the truth, soundness and verity of Judg∣ment
in that matter; and this hath been common for many Ages; Sometimes (according to the occasion proffered) Papists have de∣stroyed Protestants, and sometimes Protestants have destroyed the Papists on this account of Heresie and Error: All which proceed∣ings have been in the Enmity and Ignorance, and not in the Power and Life of Jesus; whereby it hath come to pass, that many men have been destroyed for the cause, of which they have been more innocent than they that have destroyed them: And thus by false Judgement and cruel proceedings in the matter of Heresie and Error, many have been destroyed unjustly, and the world filled with En∣mity about difference in Religious matters, and with Murders and Cruelties, upon the false Judgements of men about heresie; and this is weighty, to be truly considered, a case to be lamented and grie∣ved for, by the righteous: Oh what strife (in the Christian World) hath been for Ages on this occasion, each sort of People exclaim∣ing against, and persecuting others as Hereticks and seditious persons, onely for difference in Judgement in spiritual cases, and each parti∣cular person (almost) raging with fury, and intending his Neigh∣bours destruction, and onely for being contrary-minded in point of Doctrine and Worship. Oh! the view of these things, and woful effects produced in the world for ages in these occasions, makes my heart grieve, because of the destructions of men, yea of the destruction of many upon wrongful judgements and proceedings on these occasions: I am troubled, I am troubled; and ever since I have known the right hand from the left (in God's matters) my soul often in the deep search of these things, hath cryed out, How woful are they! And when shall it once be, that these things shall be no more in the world, but that every man may sit at rest and quiet with his God in the way, faith and practises of righteousness, as his heart is perswa∣ded of, and not be tossed with false Judgements, cruel afflictions, and hard dealing, because of his Judgement and Conscience in the belief and knowledge of heavenly matters: Thus hath my spirit been fra∣med with zeal against these things; this imposing of Religion by force, these proceedings of killing and destroying men upon the account of Heresie; these things my soul hath loathed, and I am weary of them, and my zeal is kindled against them: Oh! when will the Rulers of this world learn wisdom, and forsake false Judgement and Oppression! And when will it be that they will onely rule and judge for the
Lord in their state and compass of worldly affairs between man and man, in the matters of outward wrongs and injuries! And when wil they leave it to the Lord to be Judge, King and Ruler onely, in all the cases of his spiritual Kingdom. Then should it be happy and blessed unto men, unto Kings and their subjects, to Rulers and their People, and to all sorts of persons, if Judgement were onely ascri∣bed unto God, that he onely might judge and determine of these cases, and punish men according to the desert of their offences of error; then should it be well with them: But in the mean time, whilst men are judged and supposed to be Hereticks, and thereup∣on sentenced to death, banishment, or corporal punishment for their (supposed) errors sake in matters of Judgement and Conscience: Tribulation, misery, distractions, and woful consequences will follow upon that work, to Kings, Rulers and People, in every Nation and Countrey, and no peace, true comfort nor happiness, shall be in the midst of men. And this is the Judgement of the Spirit of God in him who hath obtained favour from God, to receive knowledge and understanding in these matters. He that can receive this, let him. CHAP. III. Concerning Antichrist and his Mysterie of Deceivableness; What he is in him∣self, and how he appears in the World; what his works are, and what his Govern∣ment is, and where it is, and who are the Subjects of his Kingdom. 1. THese things are great Mysteries; and though in the world they are very much abounding, and extant through∣out
all Nations, yet for the most part unknown unto the world, and not discovered among the sons of men, but secretly hidden, and veiled under false covers, and in much deceivableness dwelling and working upon earth, in the deep Mysteries of Iniquity, to the deceiving of multitudes of People, who are indeed of Antichrist, among whom he dwells, appears, rules, reigns, and hath his Autho∣rity and Government, and yet they know it not, nor do they dis∣cern him in his ways and works, though they are under his Power, and subjects of his Kingdom, such indeed is the Mysteries of Anti∣christ, his hidden, false covered pathes, in which he works and walks amongst the sons of men in the world, that he easily beguiles and betrays men, and deceiveth them unto perdition, while yet they know not that they are beguiled and deceived, but think they are altogether well, and do well, and are in the way of salvation, be∣ing led of that wicked one, and blinded by him, and are bewitched into the false faith, and deceivable pretence of goodness righteousness, holiness and sanctity, as if they were indeed members of the true Church, and Saints of the Most High, and had a right to eternal life, and were the very sons and servants of the Almighty, when indeed and in truth they are yet in the estate of enmity against God, in the degeneration and bondage of corruption, unconverted and unsanctified, and sinners and ungodly, the very Children of the De∣vil, and servants of unrighteousness, and have no assurance nor right unto the Kingdom of God, to rest in his peace and glory; such (I say) is the working of Antichrist, that he appears to be in the world contrary to what he truly is in his own being and nature, and deceives men and people into the apprehensions and conceits of what they are not, even contrary to what they are in their present state and standing; even so deep and mysterious is Antichrist in himself, and in his workings among the Children of men. 2. That there is such a man, or spirit in the world as Anti∣christ, this is not doubtful, but confessed by all, and proved by the Scriptures; for the Apostle wrot to the Church, They had heard that Antichrist should come, and even now saith he are there many Antichrists come into the world, 1 Joh. 2.18. and also 2 Joh. 7. vers. saith he, For many deceivers are entered into the world, and this is a deceiver, and an Antichrist, &c. and 2 Thes. 2. the Apostle speaks of the man of sin, and of the son of perdition, that should be revealed in
the world, and should exalt himself above all that is called God; These, with many other Scriptures, do prove that there is such a thing in the world, already come into the world, and now dwelling and walking in the world as Antichrist, Man of sin, and Son of perdition; and as I said, 'tis consessed by all that there is an Antichrist, such a Man, or Spirit now extant in the world; though there are great debates and contentions amongst many cal∣led Christians, what this Antichrist is, and who he is, some hold∣ing one thing, and some another about Him, and there is much difference amongst men concerning this matter, and 'tis the general way of people one sort to accuse another that are dif∣ferent from them in Profession and Religion, That ye and ye are of Antichrist; but this hath been for the most part in enmity, and in the spirit of wrath and contention, and is not from true judgment and knowledge; now therefore it remains to be made manifest according to the gift of grace, knowledge and understanding, what Antichrist is in himself, and how he appears in the world, see∣ing we have proved that there is such a thing as Antichrist now ruling and reigning some where amongst men, throughout the Na∣tions of the Earth. 3. Antichrist is not (as some suppose) a particular visible per∣son upon earth, distinct and divided from all other persons, as if none besides such an one were Antichrist; but Antichrist is ra∣ther an invisible Spirit; a Spirit I say, dwelling in persons, even in many persons throughout the world, which makes them all of Antichrist, or to be many Antichrists, according to 1 Joh. 2.18. There are many Antichrists, saith John, whereby we know it is the last time; so that 'tis plain there are in the world many Antichrists, many men of sin, or many sinful men, many sons of perdition and ungodliness; not onely one man that is such, but many men in the world, even all such in whom the spirit of An∣tichrist, or Antichrist that spirit dwels and walks, they are all An∣tichrists, or of Antichrist, because of that spirit of Antichrist which doth possess them, and rule them in the ways of sin and death, in Idolatry and false ways, and in opposition to, and a∣gainst Christ Jesus the Lord of Life, even all the deceivers in the world, all that are erred from the Spirit and Power of Christ, and are not of the true Church, gathered into his Name and
Power, but brings another Doctrine than that of Christ and his Saints, and truly confesses not in word and practise, unto Jesus come in the flesh, all such are Antichrists, and of Antichrist, accor∣ding to 2 John 7. even all the Apostates who profess Christ and his Truth, and his Church, and are not in the Spirit and Power of Christ, but in the form of godliness, without the power, professing God in words, but in works denying him, all such are Antichrists, by reason of that Spirit of Antichrist which dwells in them, and into which Spirit they are leavened and moulded, and are one with it, and brings forth the fruits of it in the world; and therefore they are Antichrists, more than one, even many Antichrists, as I have said. 4. Antichrist in himself is the man of sin, the Son of Perditi∣on, which is indeed and in truth the very Devil in his nature and kind, and in his power and spirit, and of him, and yet not divided nor distinct from him, but is him (to wit, the Devil) as he is in himself; and he is against Christ, and wholly contrary to Christ, and brings forth fruits and works to the dishonor of Christ, and op∣poseth Christ, and is in all things of a contrary nature and quality to Jesus Christ; and he is called Antichrist, to wit, before, or against, and contrary to Christ; And this is Antichrist in himself, an Adver∣sary to God, an Enemy to all righteousness, a perverter of the ways of God, a hater of all good, a despiser and persecutor of God's people, and indeed a certain spirit and power distinct, divided and seperated from the living God, and his Son Jesus Christ, and contrary in nature and quality, in fruits and effects; and there is no fellowship in any thing between Christ and Antichrist, but they are divided and sepa∣rated one from the other, contrary and opposite one to the other in all their ways and works, and in their kinds and natures; for (as I have said) Antichrist in himself, in his nature and kind, is the Devil, and no other; he is the Man of sin, the sinful man, that conceiveth and worketh all evil, the son of perdition, the son that is lost from God, and reprobate for ever; he that is fallen, diverted, and cast out from the Presence, Glory and Power of the Creator; he that is seal∣ed unto vengeance in the wrath and enmity against God and Christ Jesus, as being contrary, irreconcilably to the nature and works of Christ.
This is said of Antichrist as what he is in himself, as that parti∣cular spirit, and not of the many Antichrists, which are onely Ves∣sel, retaining this one spirit, and members of him through his Power dwelling in them, and by which they are one with this Spirit, and one in action, and brings forth the works and fruits of it; for 'tis pos∣sible, some that are such in their present standing, even under the Power of Antichrist, may be converted and turned from him, and changed into another nature, and so saved; but as for the Antichrist in himself, as such, he is the Devil, and sealed up in the anger of God, never to be redeemed, nor saved, nor changed into another nature. 5. Though Antichrist in himself be the Devil, yet his appearances in the world are divers and many; and he appears in outward and vi∣sible actions amongst men diversly; sometimes he appears in the way and form of open prophaneness, by the works of men, in all manner of unrighteousness and iniquity; for all sin of what kind soever, in every appearance of it, is of the Devil and Antichrist, even all pro∣phane wayes and work of evil men, loving drunkenness, whoredom, dou∣ble-dealing, envy, malice, and every evil work and word brought forth by the sons of Adam in the fall, are all of Antichrist and the Devil, and is his visible appearance in the world, though sometime his appea∣rance is in another way and manner, even in a way of seeming righ∣teousness and holiness, and in the profession of Christ and Christianity, and pretence of Faith towards God, and Worship of God, and cry∣ing up Church and Fellowship in the same, and forms of Godliness; as if Antichrist were a Saint and Servant of God, thus, and after this manner doth Antichrist appear in the world amongst men now in these latter dayes, since the Apostles time, in the Apostacy of Christi∣anity: Antichrist (I say) though the Devil in himself, yet hath he often appeared as a Saint upon Earth in the pretence of holiness, righteousness, worship and religion; such hath been his policy and de∣ceivableness, that he hath put on the appearance of Gospel, Doctrine, Ministry and Ordinances, and covered himself thereby, that he might the better beguile, entangle and deceive mankind in the form and profession of a Saint, and Member of the true Church, he hath put on the sheeps cloathing, hath made use of the Saints words and practices, and hath exalted himself in the Temple of God, as if he were God; shewing himself to be God, and hath been lifted up above
all that is called God, according to 2 Thes. 2.4. and Christ himself said to his Disciples, That there should arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and should shew signs and wonders, if it were possible to deceive the very Elect, Matth. 24 24. which doth signifie, that the An∣tichrists and false Prophets should come into the world after his prophecie, which are already come since that time; they should pretend to be Christs, and should shew signs, and should deceive ma∣ny with the profession of Christ, and signs of Godliness; and they should have upon them, and be covered with sheeps-cloathing; that is, with the Saints words and practices in outward appearance; but inwardly, that is, in their own proper nature, fruits and works should be ravening Wolves; that is, destroyers of the flock, Matth. 7.15. and the Antichrists which John speaks, 1 Joh 2 19. they were such as went from the Saints that were in the power of god∣liness, they went out of the true Church, and carried with them the form of righteousness and truth, and the profession of Christiani∣ty, but without the power, and had lost it, and were departed from the Spirit of Christ, and the spirit of Antichrist had possessed them, and now led them, and ruled them, and they were An∣tichrists (to wit) against him, and contrary to him; and these were the false Prophets and Deceivers, that went out into the world and deceived it, and led many aside into error, and many followed their pernicious and hurtful ways, as Peter saith, 2 Pet. 2. vers. 2, 3. and Paul speaks of such, as had a form of godliness, but denied the power, and in words professed God, but in works denied him; such were the Antichrists and Deceivers in the Apostles days, and such they are at this time in the world; whereby it is mani∣fest, that Antichrist often appears in the world as a Saint, as a righteous one, and the many Antichrists they have gotten the form & appearance of Church, Ministry, Worship, and Ordinances; and thus they appear deceiving the world & them that dwel there∣in, with the appearance and vain-shew of Faith, Worship and Reli∣gion, without the Power of Godliness; for unto that Antichrist is an enemy, even a destroyer, a persecutor and gainsayer of Christ and his works, and the power of godliness and true Faith brought forth by the Spirit of Christ, though to deceive the world he can trans∣form himself into, and appear as an Angel of Light.
6. Again, so deceeivable and mysterious is, and hath the appea∣rance and working of Antichrist been in the world, that he hath not alwayes dwelt in one kind of form and profession of Religion and Righteousness, but he hath dwelt in many appearances, and removed out of one false form, into another, according to his opportunity and advantage, whereby he could deceive; and sometime dwelling in one form, with pretence of zeal, and performance of duty to God, he hath envied, persecuted, and destroyed many others in other ways of profession, more zealous, upright and sincere to God, than them∣selves have been in the other form; and by the colour of zeal, and performance of duty, hath Antichrist cloathed himself in his envies, persecutions and murders of others, as if he did not persecute nor im∣pose upon the Conscience of any, nor exercise that rigor (or justice, as he hath named his proceedings, though never so cruel and unjust) towards any, upon any tearms or account of wrath, bitterness, envy or cruelty, but zeal, duty and love to Religion, and to extinguish He∣resie, &c. This hath been the pretence and cloak of Antichrist in his cruel and hard dealing with many men that have differed in principle and practice of Religion; he hath often shewed himself in his pre∣sent form of godliness, so zealous and dutiful for the truth of his way, (though never so Idolatrous) against all that have opposed it, & gain∣sayed his form and vain shew, that he hath killed, slain, and exercised cruelty towards all that have been contrary or different-minded; and though this hath been brought forth by Antichrist, as he is the Devil in himself, and in down-right envy, malice, persecution, and wickedness; yet it hath been acted and effected under the Cloak of Zeal, Duty and Sincerity, and out of pretence of love to Christ and his Church, and out of pretence of hatred against the contrary. Thus hath Antichrist (though the Devil, that wicked one, as he is in himself, in his own nature, kind, and proper sphear) appeared in the world as a zealous Church-Member, as a Saint, as a promoter of Righ∣teousness, and a destroyer of the contrary: With these false covers hath Antichrist been cloaked and hidden from men, and appeared to be in his works and transactions, as a good man, as a lover of God, and hater of iniquity, while in the mean time he hath been deceiving men, and destroying the innocent, and leading the world to perpetual misery and destruction.
7. Again, so deceivable hath the spirit of Antichrist been in the World, that he hath always put the Name of Christ, and the Name of his Church, and the pretence of duty to God, and the Name of Gospel, Doctrine, Ordinances, Ministry and Worship, upon whatsoever false way, feigned Worship, and deceitful profession, that he hath gone about to set up and promote in the world among men: I say, upon the worst and most Idolatrous wayes of superstition, and the most false, feigned, formal Worship that ever hath been in the world, Antichrist hath put the Name of Christ, his Church and Worship, upon them, and imposed and forced the belief and practice of much false Wor∣ship, false Doctrine, and formal wayes, under the name and title of the true Christ, his Doctrine and Worship, and upon pains and penalties hath enjoined and commanded the belief and practice of such things, not as if they were of Antichrist, superstitious, evil, false or feign∣ed; but as if they were of Christ altogether, and must be believed and practised, as by his Name, and under his Authority: Thus hath been the working of the Mysterie of Iniquity of that man of sin, the Antichrist, all the evil wayes he hath conceived and brought forth in the world; all the idolatrous Worship, and false Faith and Doctrine, and all the Cruelties, Murders, and unjust dealing, to the very destroying of the Saints; and all the unrighteousness and deceive∣ableness exercised by Antichrist in the world, hath put all this on the Name of Christ, and pretended Christ for it, as if it were indeed and in truth of him, and from him, when indeed and in truth it hath been contrary to the true Christ, and tended to kill and destroy him: Thus hath Antichrist the Devil been cloaked with false covers and deceitful pretences in his working among men; that wicked spirit hath falsly called the greatest of pride and ambition, decency and true ho∣nour; covetousness and deceitful dealing, hath he stiled good Husban∣dry, and prudent walking; and the most cruel and unjust Judgement, the oppression of the poor, and the grinding of the face of the inno∣cent, hath that Spirit falsly titled equal proceedings, justice, and according to Law, and the like: Yea, and the Persecutions and Mur∣ders that ever hath been acted against the Saints of God in all Gene∣ration, though cruel and unrighteous, and of the Devil; yet all this hath Antichrist titled to be in honor to Christ, and for the destroying Hereticks, and out of Justice and Zeal for God, and such like; yea and the most grosse Idolatries, and most deceitful ways of Worship that
ever have been set up in the world, have been named after Christ, and pretended to be done in honor to him; and for his glory, and so forth, so deceivable hath Antichrist been in the world, and walked and wrought among the sons of men, in deceiving of them, that he hath used, and taken upon him the very Name of Christ; and all his evil works of iniquity of all kinds, hath he put the Name and Honour of Christ upon them, and so deceived the World by his false wayes, worships, doctrines and persecutions, through covering these things with the Name of Christ, and pretending his honor and ex∣altation, when as his own true property and nature is to kill Christ, and gain-say him. And this indeed is Antichrist, who under colour and pretence of worshipping and honoring Christ, doth seek to slay him. This is that Fox, crafty and deceitful, that Man of Sin that hath been exalted; that Antichrist, the wicked one, that hath decei∣ved the world for many Ages; but the Lord is now discovering him, and destroying him by the breath of his mouth, and by the brightness of his coming, according to the faithful promise of God in his Ser∣vants, and Antichrist shall be discovered and destroyed: The Day of the Lord is at hand upon him. 8. Again, it hath been the way of Antichrist, that he might the better deceive the world, to transform himself into the like∣ness of the best way and strictest profession of Religion, and so to re∣move from one way and form unto another, as I said before, that he might the better deceive men; according as Paul writ, 2 Cor. 11. vers. 13, 14. for such are false Apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ; and no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light; by which it is plain, that Antichrist did change and transform him∣self, and remove from one way to another, even till he appeared as an angel of Light, and in the very way and form of the Mini∣stry of Righteousness; thus did Antichrist work and transform him∣self in the days of the Apostles, and ever since unto this day in all times and ages; for it hath been his manner and way, when he could no longer cover himself, nor be hid in such a way of Wor∣ship and Religion in which he hath sometimes dwelt and walked; but that his wickedness, cruelties, persecutions and deceits must needs be seen and made appear unto men by the Light of the Lord shi∣ning amongst them; then he hath transformed into another like∣ness,
and removed his cruelties and persecutions into another form and appearance; it may be into the very way (in the outward professi∣on and practice of it) in which sometime the Lord hath dwelt and walked, and there hath he dwelt deceiving the world by his new form and appearance, and exercised his wickedness, cruelties and persecuti∣ons, in some new way, having quitted the last form in which he dwelt, because he was there too publikely seen and discovered: And now in his new likeness into which he is transformed, he can plead the ex∣ample of Saints; they did such things, and held such Doctrines, and performed such practises as now he is found in; and this did the De∣vil sometime to Christ, he pleaded Scripture against him: And thus Antichrist can change himself into divers appearances, that he may deceive men: Well, but and if he be again discovered, and his cru∣elties and wickedness made appear in his last and newest form, he can transform again into a more strict way, and zealous performance, even into an Angel of Light, as if he were indeed the true Christ, and were in the Truth altogether, and no man needed to doubt of the truth of his way; and then under that form being covered with more zeal then ever, with more pretence of duty to God then before, he blinds the world, and deceives them, and leads men to perdition; and though changeable in his appearance, yet is he in himself Antichrist still, in his own proper nature a Murderer, Destroyer, and a Fountain of Mischief and Evil. The truth of this is plain, if it be consider∣ed throughout the course of Scriptures in Generations past, and transactions of time; as in the Prophets dayes of old, this Spirit (which is no other but the Devil) sometimes opposed, gain-sayed, and persecuted the Prophets, reproached them, and withstood them, and imprisoned them, and killed them: And sometimes we find the same spirit transformed it self into the way of the Prophets, and acted by some deceivers and false Prophets in the same words and practices, which the true Prophets had said and done; and as the true Prophets used their tongues, and said, The Lord saith it; so the false Prophets (in whom the Devil was transformed) they used their tongues, and said, The Lord saith it (also,) when God had not spoken to them: So here was this Spirit of Antichrist changing and trans∣forming himself, that he might the better deceive. Also, in the dayes of Christ and his Apostles, the Devil and Antichrist ap∣peared
against them, and persecuted them, and killed them and used cruelty and injustice towards them; and (as before I said) this was done to Christ and his Apostles, by the wicked Jews, under colour and pretence of love to their God, and zeal for their Law, and for the honor of their Ordinances and Priesthood, which they suppo∣sed Christ and his Apostles made void. Which shews, that the Devil and Antichrist appears in the world as a good man, as a lover of God, and his Laws, and the like. Well, but though the envious men, and wicked persons, (through the spirit of the Devil) did for some time oppose, gainsay, and persecute Christ and his Apostles, yet the same Spirit (possibly some of the same persons) trans∣formed into the profession of Christ, and into the profession of the words and works of Him and his Apostles: For we find envious men, and wicked men, such as had persecuted Christ, and kil∣led him, were gotten to preach him in words, and had got∣ten and taken upon them the Form of Christ's Doctrine, and preached him out of Envy, and for self-ends, and the like: So that 'tis plain, The same Spirit that sometime opposed and perse∣cuted the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, other times was trans∣formed into the profession of the Prophets, Christ and his Apo∣stles words: And this is the way of Antichrist, to deceive men upon Earth, and to lead them to perdition: For when the Devil and Antichrist perceives that his Envy, Malice and Cruelty can∣not prevail to subdue and keep under the Way and Truth of Christ Jesus, as it appears in the world, then he transforms into the likeness and formal appearance of the way of the Lord, and his Truth; and when the Devil cannot kill Christ so, but that Christ will rise again, appear, and live for ever, contrary to all the malice and enmity of the Devil; then (rather than he will submit to be no more) he will transform himself, and take upon him the Name of Christ, of his Honour and Glory, and profess him in words, and seem a Friend to Christ and his King∣dom: And this he doth, that he may live still in the world, and by deceiveableness beguile the sons of men into perpetual destru∣ction.
9. And the very work of Antichrist this day in the world, is to deceive, beguile, seduce and betray the world and all mankind; 'tis his onely work and calling, as I may say, to deceive, 'tis his nature and property to work deceitfully; and thus it ever was with him, it hath been his property and his work in all ages, and in every age since the beginning of the world, to deceive and beguile, to lead men from God, and to lead them into perdition; this I say hath ever been his work in the world, and by the means aforesaid, (to wit) by transforming and changing himself into the likeness of righteousness and verity, and putting the pretence of goodness, virtue and holiness upon his actions and doings, though never so evil and unrighteous, he hath always, I say, by this means, and in this way deceived the world, by appearing as a Saint, as a well-doer, as an angel of Light, pretending wisdom, righteousness and virtue, and coloring his deeds thereby, as is proved in the case of the first deceiving of Eve; What said Satan to the Woman? Not that I am such a one, and do intend to deceive thee with falsity; but, Thou shalt be as God; Thou shalt be wise of thy self, and know, and be, and do as God: Here was a fair pretence, by which he deceived the Woman. And the false Prophets and false Apostles in the days of old, did not deceive the world into an absolute denial of God, and Christ, and Truth, but did deceive them into the false Profession of the same, holding out the form of godliness without the power; and by feigned words, and good speeches, did deceive the hearts of the simple; and by false Do∣ctrine, and Ordinances, and Form of Religion, did the Antichrist deceive the World in dayes past, as he doth at this day: For if he did appear to be as he is in his in his own nature and property, a Devil, Deceiver, and wicked one, a Leader to Perdi∣tion and Destruction, and should vindicate himself as such, and entice and tempt people as such; then none would be∣lieve him, nor follow his wayes, for none would willingly be destroyed. But he appears not as such in the world, but al∣wayes transforms himself into the likeness of God and Goodness, still pretending the same: And by this means is he more capa∣ble to deceive mankind; for he cannot so readily deceive and lead men to perdition in his own proper Nature, if he appear
as he is such: But therefore he appears contrary to what his own nature is, and transforms himself. And thus doth Antichrist de∣ceive the Christian World (so called) at this day, even by his false wayes of Religion, false Worship, false Doctrine, false Humi∣lity, false Faith, and false Church, pretending zeal and sanctity, and such like: Herein and hereby (generally) doth Antichrist that Man of Sin, deceive and beguile the World unto perdition and de∣struction. Oh! how many thousands of Peoples, of Nations and Countreys, are at this day deceived on this wise, thinking they are in the truth, and true way of Religion, Faith and Worship, pro∣fessing and performing these things with much zeal, as if they were indeed the wayes and Ordinances of Christ, when as they are but false, feigned, formal, and of Antichrist, and deceivable to the souls of men, even shews without substance; forms without life and power; of Antichrist, and not of the true Christ. And thus, and after this manner, with the very likeness of Righteousness, and appearance of Godliness, and profession of Faith and duty to God, hath Antichrist deceived the world, and doth at this day de∣lude Nations, to the perdition of thousands: And Antichrist doth not generally deceive men in his works and appearance as he is in his own proper Nature; but in his appearance and works trans∣formed and changed into another likeness, even into the likeness of truth and righteousness: By this means and way Satan, Anti∣christ, and that Man of Sin, doth delude and deceive the Nations of the world. 10. What the Works of Antichrist are, by what is said, doth partly appear: His Works are all deceivableness, to deceive and delude the world, to lead mankind captive in the wayes of sin and death, unto the destruction of their souls, and to be cruel and hard-hearted, envious, malicious and perverse, a hater and per∣secutor of goodnesse and good men, and to murder and work wick∣edness, to do all evil, and to oppose, gain-say and deny all good: This in general is the work of Antichrist; though as to particu∣lars I now intend not to mention, saving as I have before shew∣ed, to impose upon Conscience in Religious matters, by outward force and violence, is a main principal work of Antichrist; and to kill and destroy persons on the account of Heresie and Error, and to use vio∣lence
and cruel impositions in spiritual Cases, contrary to the Spirit of Christ Jesus. These are works and ways of Antichrist, which lie brings forth in the World, as also the promoting of all the false and Idolatrous Worships, and false Church-Governments in the World; and in short, every evil work and word brought forth amongst the sons of men, are the Works of the Devil and Anti∣christ, which he seduceth the World into the working and do∣ing of; and to consider the state of the World as it is at this day, and how it is deceived into many grievous and abomi∣nable wayes of Error, Superstitions, Idolatries and Wickedness, it makes the hearts of the Righteous sad and mournful, be∣cause of the deceivableness of the working of the Mysterie of Iniquity, of Antichrist, that Man of Sin in the World, who deceiveth Mankind with the appearance and shew of godliness, and leads the Children of Men in the ways of Ignorance, Death, B lindness and Error, yet holds them under a false perswasion of safety and security, as if they were in the right way, and walked in the pathes of Happiness, when indeed and in truth they are beguiled and deceived, and nigh unto the pathes of Perdition. Oh! how hath Antichrist prevailed in these latter dayes, since the dayes of the Apostles, and deceived the world with the very formal profession and practice of such Doctrines and Things as the Apostles held and practised in the Power of God in their dayes: But now Antichrist he holds the form in his false Spirit, and hath the appearance and likenesse of Righteousnesse, Truth, Faith and Worship, without the Power of God, even the likenesse of the things that the Apostles and Saints held in the Power of God: And hereby is the World deceived, though Antichrist hath taught them to plead Scriptures, and prove by Scriptures, that the Apostles did the same things, and held the same Profession; yet being now held and professed our of the Power of God, and not in the same Spirit that the Apostles were in, 'tis but of Antichrist, and deceiveable, and leads captive the souls of men into de∣struction. Oh therefore that the World, and all that dwel there∣in, would consider the danger of that deceivable Spirit of Anti∣christ, and how he deceiveth mankind, and would turn from
him, and forsake the wayes and works of Antichrist, that they may be saved, and not destroyed. Oh! all ye called Christians, 'tis time to consider what spirit ye are of, and what spirit leads you, and how ye may escape his delusions; for the Day of the Lord is come, and he is gathering People out of the wayes of An∣tichrist, and setting them free from his cruel Bonds, to serve the Lord in Liberty and Freedom of the Spirit of Christ Jesus; and blessed are all they that witness this, where Christ reigns, and Antichrist is subdued with his works and fruits, and discovered and destroyed by the Spirit of the Lord, and the brightness of his Coming, who comes to judge the World in Righteousnesse and Truth. 11. These things are said in general of Antichrist; Now it re∣mains to be shewed, What the Government of Antichrist is in it self, and where it is in being, and who the Subjects of his Kingdom are. That Antichrist the Man of Sin hath a Government, a Kingdom, a Power, an Authority, a Rule and a Dominion (which is indeed his Go∣vernment) this is not doubtful to any, but acknowledged by all; but what this Kingdom and Government is, many are ignorant. Now the Kingdom and Government of Antichrist is not the Government and Authority of some particular man, in some particular Coun∣trey and Nation upon Earth, distinct from all other Persons and Nations, as if such a particular visible Kingdom and Authority, were Antichrist's Government, and none besides: But the Authori∣ty, Kingdom and Government of Antichrist is more invisible, more hidden, as it were more spiritual and undiscernable unto the sons of men, than any visible, outward Kingdom is: And indeed, the Kingdom of Antichrist is the Authority and Power of Spiritual Wickedness, of spiritual, invisible Iniquity, or the Rule and Do∣minion of the Son of Perdition, of the Man of Sin, exercised in the hearts and spirits of all ungodly men: This is the Kingdom and Government of Antichrist, an authority of spiritual wicked∣nesse, a Power of the Mysterie of Iniquity, and of invisible pre∣vailing of the Son of Perdition in, and over the hearts of the sons of men; not onely of one person, or in one Nation or King∣dom of the world, but in all sinful persons, and over all Nations of the Earth; Antichrist's Government is such throughout King∣doms
of this world, even a Spiritual Power of Wickedness, a domi∣nion and authority of the Mysterie of Iniquity, ruling and reign∣ing in the hearts of many men, even of all sinful men, of all un∣just men, of all unconverted men through all Nations in the World: So that it may not be truly said, that Antichrist's Kingdom and Go∣vernment is onely the particular authority of any particular man, in a particular Nation of the Earth, and all others (Men and Nations) are free; but it is (as I have said) the Authority, Power and Rule of the Spirit of Wickedness, of the Mysterie of Iniquity, in the hearts of all evil men, in all Nations through the World. And this is tru∣ly the Kingdom of Antichrist in it self. 12. This Government is placed and set up, and chiefly the place and being of it, is (not onely in all Nations at large, but) in the hearts, even in particular hearts of the sons of men, in the heart and inward parts of man, is the place where Antichrist's Govern∣ment is; his authority, power and dominion, is in the hearts of the un∣godly, in the inward parts of transgressors; in the heart Antichrist (that Man of Sin) dwells and works, according as it is written, 2 Thess. 2.9, 10 speaking of that man of sin whose coming is after the working of Satan with all lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; His dwelling and working is in them that perish, in the ungodly, in the hypocrites, in all idolaters, in all false Worshippers: Thus it is manifest, that the Government of Antichrist is in the heart, not onely of one man in some Nations, but in the hearts of all such men men mentioned, in all the Kingdoms of the World, even the mysterie of iniquity, the spiritual wickedness, the authority and power of that Spirit that is against Christ, and con∣trary to him (which is the Rule, Kingdom and Government of Anti∣christ) dwells and works in the hearts of the sons of men, even like as Christ Jesus dwells and walks in his Saints, as it is written, so accordingly doth Antichrist dwell and walk in all that are the Sub∣jects of his Kingdom: Yet notwithstanding, the Government of An∣tichrist is in the hearts of men, originally there, as having got domi∣nion and power over the seed of God, and placed it self in the heart, which is its seat, and where Christ should reign; yet the Government of Antichrist is not so spiritual, so hidden and invisible in the heart, but that it appears outwardly and visibly in the actions and fruits of
men; so that the outward actions and works of men are leavened and siasted with the Spirit of Antichrist, and his Government appears vi∣tble in Antichristian wayes and works brought forth by men; the sin∣fulness of men, the hypocrisies of men, the idolatries of men, and the false principles and doctrines of men, which appear visibly, are the works of Antichrist, and his Government stands in these things; in these works he governs men, and to the doing of them he leads and rules men by his Authority and Power, which is in the hearts of men. And thus Antichrist's Government appears visible and out∣ward, and is in the outward actions and works of men to be seen in the world, as well as the working of his Power and Authority is in the heart, inwardly. And also Antichrist's Government is extended not onely, as first, dwelling and working in the hearts of the ungodly; nor secondly, as over the works of men particularly; but over the Governments of many Nations and Countreys in general, is Antichrists Power and Rule extended; so that the Governments of the world are levened and tasted with Antichristian Power and Authority in many Nations, even the Spirit of Antichrist hath possessed many hearts, many works, and not onely so, but many Governments amongst men; and this hath appeared and broken forth visible in all the works of unrigh∣teousness, injustice, oppressions and persecutions, brought forth in worldly Governments; for so much as hath been brought forth in any Government, in any Nation, at any time, of unrighteousnesse, injustice, oppression, idolatry, false worship and persecutions, and of any other evils, even so much of Antichrist's Kingdom, Government and Power, hath been in that Kingdom and Government; and that Kingdom and Government wheresoever, in what Nation and Coun∣trey soever, hath been Antichristian, even in so much, and by so much as Injustice, Wickedness, Cruelty, Persecution, or any acts of sin and wickedness have been, or are brought forth into action in that Government. And thus it is manifest what, and where Anti∣christ's Government is: Now I shall briefly shew who the subjects of his Kingdom are. 1. All the ungodly, unrighteous, and unconverted persons in gene∣ral throughout the world, are the Subjects of Antichrists Kingdom, all the sons of fallen Adam, in transgression, all that are in the first
birth, in degeneration, in the alienation and separation from God; even all that are wicked, and do wickedly, that are in the Enmity against Christ, and unholy, unsanctified, and unregenerate, these are all of An∣tichrists Kingdom, subjects of it, and servants to it, and it rules in them, and over them, and Antichrist is their Ruler in all these their wicked wayes, and in this their present state and condition. 2. All Hypocrites, that profess God in words, and in works deny him, that make a shew of Religion and Worship, when their hearts are far from the Lord; that with their mouths profess much love to God, and with their lips honor him, but are departed from his fear, and stand not in his Counsel, all such are subjects of the goverment of Antichrist, even all false-hearted, dissembling Hypocrites, that pro∣fess more of God, then they know of him by the operation of his Spirit; that have an outward conformity in appearance, of worship, and duty to God-wards, and their hearts are not conformed to the Power of God, by his Spirit; all such are of the Government of Antichrist, and his Kingdom and Power dwells in them, and they are under the Dominion thereof. 3. All Idolaters, false-worshippers, Hereticks and erroneous per∣sons; such as cry up Church and Ministry, and profess Faith and Godliness, and yet are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, nor led of it into all Truth, these are subjects of the aforesaid Govern∣ment of Antichrist; even all they that are sensually minded, and have not the Spirit of Christ guiding them in the way of righte∣ousness and truth, who are not converted and born again, and renew∣ed into the image and likeness of Christ Jesus; and yet practices holiness, and duty to Godwards in outward appearance, and are in the profession of the words of Christ and his Prophets and Apostles, but have not the same spirit and power of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Prophets and Apostles had, these are covered with sheeps-cloathing, and professes Christ, and his words, but are against Christ, and con∣trary to Him in kind and nature; and all such are of the Govern∣ment of Antichrist, and hee governs them, and rules over them. 4. All Back-sliders, and them that have forsaken the right way of the Lord, all that are turned against the Truth of God which once they knew and believed, and were convinced of, and some∣times
professed, these are all subjects of Antichrist's raign and au∣thority, even all the unfaithful and false-hearted, who are treache∣rous to God and men, and unconstant and changeable, time-servers and hypocrits, who have denied Christ before men, and turned against him, and against his Saints, such are under Satans power, and he works in their hearts, and Antichrist deceivs them, and they are under his power and dominion, and are subjects of his Go∣vernment. 5. All persecutors of the Saints, all violent and cruel men, all that persecutes such as are contrary-minded to themselves, are of Antichrist, and subjects of his kingdom; even all that kill, and burn, and destroy for difference of Faith and Religion, who them∣selves profess love to God, and his Way, and yet will persecute others, and destroy them by cruel dealing; and that would not suffer any to live but themselves, and will not do to others as they would be done unto, but hates the Neighbour, and persecutes Bro∣ther, and imposes upon his Conscience in things against good Consci∣ence, and are violent doers; all such men are Subjects of Anti∣christ's Kingdom, in all Nations throughout the world. There∣fore let all consider, this is the Day of the Lord, God will disco∣ver and destroy Antichrist and his Kingdom: Let the wicked and ungodly turn from his evil way, lest God destroy him with perpe∣tual destruction. Lastly, 'tis the property of such who are subjects of Antichrists Kingdom, to profess and cry up much of Christ in words, of what he said and did, of his life, of his death, of what he hath been, and what he shall be, and yet to deny the present enjoyment of Christ, to that Antichrist is an enemy; he can well away with it to speak of Christ at a distance, but he cannot bear it if any hold forth a present enjoyment of Christ; that Christ takes away sin, and for∣gives it, and that his blood cleanseth from it, and that he is the Justifier, and the Redeemer and Saviour; the profession of all this in words from the letter without, and that they are things true in themselves, Antichrist can bear and make a shew of in profes∣sion, but if any of the Saints of God, do witness these things, and shall testifie in the power of the Lord the enjoyment of these things, and that they are at present in this life possessed (to wit) Christ now lives in us, and is come, and his blood hath cleansed from sin,
and he hath forgiven it, and he hath justified, redeemed and saved; I say if any do witness these things in present enjoyment, and that they are now in this present time witnessed in the Spirit of Christ, and not onely professed from the Letter without, but experienced by the work of God within; Antichrist opposeth this, and gain∣saies present enjoyment, and such indeed are subjects of Antichrists Kingdom, who have the profession of Christ in words, but no present enjoyment of him, but wants his nature, and are in the nature con∣trary to him, and feeds upon reports of things done by him without, and upon the expectations of what he shall do here∣after, and in their present state are without Christ, and are sinners and transgressors against the life of righteousness, unconverted and unregenerated by Christ, all such as these are the subjects of Anti∣christ his Kingdom. And as concerning the Rise and Fall of Antichrist, the begin∣ning and ending of his Kingdom, these things in season may be declared, if God permit. THE END. ERRATA.
