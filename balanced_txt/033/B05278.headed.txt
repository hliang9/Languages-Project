Every Nobleman in 300 Merks Scots Money; Every Baron or Knight in 200 merks; every other He∣retor, Gentleman, or chief Burgess in 100 pounds; and every other person in 100 merks, toties quoties, to be applyed for the use of the poor. It is always hereby Declared, that the verbal Information of any Party, or other person for him, when required, or allowed Judicially, or before Auditors, in Dyets appointed for both Parties to be heard, or before the Ordi∣naries upon the Bills, in relation to the passing of Bills of Suspension, or Advocation, or Advocation, or before any of the Lords, to whom either by consent of Parties, or by appointment, or recommendation of the Lords, an accomodation in any Process is re∣ferred, is no ways hereby prohibited. And to the effect the Leidges may be secured against any prejudice, which they may ap∣prehend by debarring them from Solicitation, or verbal Information; The Lords do Declare, that there shall be free ac∣cess for all persons to Inform them by written Informations only, to be delivered by Servants; and that in all cases from time to time; And for the more sure delivery of Informations, they ordain that every one of the Lords shall have a Servant attend∣ing in his House, from five a Clock, to eight a Clock at night, who shall be holden to receive any Informations, doubles of Bills, or Tickets for Calling, that shall be given in without payment of any Money, under such pain or punishment as the Lords shall think fit; And which Informations, Bills and Tickets, shall be delivered by the Servants of Advocats, or of the Parties, and by none others, and they Ordain this Act to be affixed on the VVall of the Outter-House. And to be Printed, that none may pretend Ignorance thereof. Edinburgh, December 24. 1679. THE Lords of Council and Session Considering, that notwithstanding of the Act made against Solicitation and verbal Information, dated the sixth of November, 1677. years, yet some persons are so bold as to adventure to Solicite the Lords in their Actions, and it being the Resolution of the saids Lords, that so Laudable and necessary an Act be made effectual; Therefore they Declare, that in any Process now depending, or which shall hereafter be Intented before them, when the same comes to be Advised, they will purge themselves concerning their re∣ceiving any Solicitation, or verbal Information in the Cause, if it shall either be desired by the Parties, or moved by any of their own number, and that they will delate the persons who do Soli∣cite, or verbally Inform them, that they may be punished therefore, conform to the said Act. Edinburgh, November 11. 1690. THe Lords of Council and Session do Ordain their Acts of Sederunt, of the sixth of November 1677, and the 24 of Decem∣ber 1679. against Solicitation to be Printed, and affixed on the Wall of the Outer-House; and they Ordain these Acts to be observed in all points.
