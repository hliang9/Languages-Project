And We require and command, That in the interim no other Warrants, Order, or Command whatsoever shall distract or hinder this Our Service. And We further will and command, That this Our Order be forthwith published by the Sheriffe of this Our County : For which this shall be sufficient Warrant. Given at Our Court at York, the fourteenth day of May, in the eighteenth yeer of Our Reigne, 1642.
