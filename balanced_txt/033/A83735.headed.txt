❧ Die Mercurii: 5o Maii. 1641. IT is this day Ordered by the House of Commons now assembled in Parliament, That the Preamble, together with the Protestation, which the Members of this House made the third of May, shall be forthwith Printed▪ and the Copies Printed brought to the Clark of the said House, to attest under his hand, to the end that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses may send them down to the Sheriffs and Justices of Peace of the severall Shires, and to the Citizens and Burgesses of the severall Cities, Boroughs, and Cinque Ports, respectively. And the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, are to intimate unto the Shires, Cities, Boroughs, and Cinque Ports, with what willingnesse all the Members of this House made this Protestation: And further to signifie, that as they justifie the taking of it in themselves, so they cannot but approve it in all such as shall take it. WE the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Commons house in Parliament, finding, to the great grief of our hearts, that the designes of the Priests and Iesuites, and other Adherents to the See of Rome, have of late been more boldly and frequently put in practice then formerly, to the undermining and danger of the ruine of the true reformed Protestant Religion in His Majesties Dominions esta∣blished: And finding also that there have been, and having just cause to suspect that there still are, even during this sitting in Parliament, indeavours to subvert the fundamentall Lawes of England and Ireland, and to introduce the exercise of an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall Government, by most per∣nicious and wicked Councels, Practices, Plots, and Conspiracies: And that the long intermission, and unhappy breach of Parliaments, hath occasioned many illegall Taxations, whereupon the Subject hath been prosecuted and grieved: And that divers Innovations and Superstitions have been brought into the Church; multitudes driven out of His Majesties Dominions, Iealousies raised and fomented betwixt the King and His people, a Popish Army leavied in Ireland, and two Armies brought into the bowels of this Kingdom, to the hazard of His Maje∣sties Royall Person, the consumption of the Revenues of the Crown, and Treasure of this Kingdom: And lastly, finding great cause of Iealousie, that indeavours have been, and are used to bring the English Army into a misun∣derstanding of this Parliament, thereby to incline that Army, with force to bring to passe those wicked Councels, Have therefore thought good to joyn our selves in a Declaration of our united Affections and Resolutions, and to make this ensuing Protestation. I A. B. do in the presence of Almighty God, Promise, Vow, and Protest, to maintain and defend, as far as lawfully I may, with my life, power, and estate, the true Reformed Protestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England, against all Popery and Popish Innovations within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine, and according to the duty of my Allegiance, His Majesties Royall Person, Honour, and Estate; As also the Power and Priviledges of Parlia∣ment; The lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and every person that maketh this Protestation, in what∣soever he shall do in the lawfull pursuance of the same. And to my power, and as far as lawfully I may, I will oppose, and by all good wayes and means indeavour to bring to condigne punishment, all such as shall either by Force, Practise, Councels, Plots, Conspiracies or otherwise, do any thing to the contrary of any thing in this present Protestation contained. And further, that I shall in all just and Honourable wayes indeavour to preserve the Union and Peace between the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; And neither for hope, fear, nor other respect, shall relinquish this Promise, Vow, and Protestation. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of John Bill. 1641.
