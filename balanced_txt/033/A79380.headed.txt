Whereas it appears by Experience that many Inconveniences have arisen both to Tutors and Pupils for want of due Pay∣ment of Quarterly Bills, and by reason of Pupils trading with Unlicensed Persons, and without Order of their Tutors; for the Remedying these Inconveniences, it is hereby thought fit by. Us whose Names are hereunto subscribed, Tutors in the University, to offer unto the Consideration of Mr Vicechancel∣lor and Heads of Colleges our humble Request as followeth, I. THat every Fellow Commoner before he is admitted into Commons, shall put in a Caution of—15l. 0 0. Every Pensioner—10l. 0 0. Every Sizar—6l. 0 0. This Caution to be deposited into such Hands as shall be Agreed upon by the College. This Caution to remain in such Hands 'till the said Fellow-Com∣moner, Pensioner and Sizar leave the College, and discharge all Debts to the College and Tutor, and then to be returned. II. That every Person in Statu Pupillari shall fully discharge every Quarters Bill, before the End of the next succeeding Quarter, or sooner, if the Statute, Decree or Locall Custome of any particular College require it, and unless the Tutor do own such Discharge before the Master of the College or his Locum∣tenens, such Person shall immediately be sent out of the College. III. That no Person be admitted to have his Grace pass in any College for any Degree, untill he bring a Discharge under his Tutors Hand of all Debts for which his Tutor is Responsible, to the End of the foregoing Quar∣ter (to the Master and those that are concerned to pass his Grace.) All Persons concerned are hereby required to take Notice, that no Tutor is Responsible for any Debts of his Pupils, but what are contracted by his Express Order, and if any Person adventure to Trust any such Pupil, besides the Loss of the Debt, he is liable to such further Punishment as the Laws of this Ʋniversity direct.
