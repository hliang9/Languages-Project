THE DECLARATION OF THE Convention of Estates OF THE KINGDOME OF SCOTLAND: CONCERNING The present expedition into England, according to the Commission and Order given from their Meeting at Edenburg, August, 1643. LONDON, Printed for R. W. 1643.
THE DECLARATION Of the Convention of Estates of the Kingdome of Scotland. IT is now, wee suppose, knowne to the Christian world, and will be knowne to after ages, what have beene the dangers and distresses of this Kirke and King∣dome, in their Religion and Liberties; What their endeavours and wrestlings have been for deliverance, and how mercifully and marvellously the good hand of God did settle their Religion and Peace, against the devices, attempts and practices of Papists, Prelates and Malignants: who, had they not been given up to incurable blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, would have seene and acknowledged the hand of God working against them, and themselves fighting against God. But these Enemies of all righ∣teousnesse, full of all subtilty and mischiefe, do not
cease to pervert the right wayes of the Lord. Their great project and maine designe against the refor∣med Religion and people of God, is not altered, but continueth one and the same: their furie and malice is not abated, and their plots and policies deeper, and more wicked then before; onely finding their fraud frustrated, and their forces beaten back upon one side; they have with new stratagems, fresh re∣solutions, and greater power, assaulted another part of the wall, and have made the breach so wide and large, that they have entred, and begun to roare in the midst of the Congregations of Gods people, and ore setting up their Ensignes for Signes, which to the unspeakable griefe of all who are not both voyd of Grace, and deprived of naturall affection, is to besden this day in miserable Ireland, and distressed England, and, unlesse it be prevented by their timeous and speedy deliverance, shall (wee know not how soon) be seen and felt in this Kingdome; where, as the enemies did begin, so shall they end this bloody, barbarous, and Anti-christian tragedie, if the Au∣thors be not interrupted and driven from the Stage, before they bring it to their intended conclusion and hellish applause. It is wee confesse, no small comfort to this Kirke and Kingdome, that we have been willing and ready by all good meanes from the beginning, to quench
this unnaturall fire; all who have had place and pub∣like interest, the Lords of his Majesties privie Coun∣cell, the Commissioners for conserving the peace, and the generall Assembly of this Kirke and their Commissioners, having with all care and faithful∣nesse applied themselves, from time to time, to use al good meanes; such as are their humble desires, their supplications, Declarations and Remonstrances to his Majesty for a blessed Pacification: And after all these had proved ineffectuall, Commissioners were sent to represent how much this Kirke and Kingdome from their interest in the preservation of their owne Religion, the safety of his Majesties Person, and their neer relation to their Brethren of England, were con∣cerned in the unhappy differences, betwixt his Ma∣jesty and the houses of Parliament, and in all humili∣ty and tendernesse, to make offer of their mediation and national intercession, for removing them in such a way as might most serve for his Majesties honour, and the good of his people; but after long atten∣dance, much contrary to their desires and hopes, and to the expectation of al his Majesties good Subjects in both Kingdomes (so prevalent were the Counsels of the Popish Prelaticall, and Malignant party, ap∣prehending their owne troubles and misery, in the publike peace and happinesse of the King and his people) the offer of their humble service and faith∣full
indeavours, was utterly refused & rejected, upon no other reason, but that they had no warrant nor capacity for such a mediation, although authorized by a Commission from his Majesty and Parliament for that effect; and that the intermixture of the go∣vernment of the Church of England with the civill government, was such a mysterie as could not be un∣derstood by them; although it be true which was then often replyed; that in the eighth demand of the Treaty of Peace, the desire of uniformity in Kirke∣government was kindly entertained, and received such an answer, as hath been since a doore of hope to this Kirke and Kingdome of obtaining their de∣sires: and although the houses of Parliament, who are best acquainted with the constitution of that kingdome, and whom it most concerneth, have pas∣sed their Bill, for abolishing of Episcopall govern∣ment, not only as a great impediment to the perfect reformation and growth of Religion (which in a Christian kingdome is a sufficient ground) but also, as very prejudiciall to the civil state & government. The Commissioners having returned from Oxford without successe, and the miseries of Ireland, the troubles of England, and the dangers and pressures of this kingdome more and more increasing; the Lords of his Majesties Councell, the Commissioners for conserving the Peace, and the Commissioners for
the Common burthens, all intrusted with the pub∣like affaires of the kingdome respectively, found themselves pressed above their place and power, with difficulties, which required the Common Counsell, consent and resolution of the Estates of the kingdome, and were necessitate according to the practice of former times (his Majesty having denied a Parliament, being supplicated for that effect) to call a Convention of the Estates, that by their wisdome they might consider of the common duty, and provide for the publique safety of the Kingdome, in a time of such extremity. No sooner did the Convention of Estates, which was met with more then ordinary frequency and alacrity, enter into publike consultation, but the good providence of God still watching over this Countrey for good, did bring to their hand, a discovery of divers trea∣cherous attempts, against the Kirke and Kingdom; as if the Convention had been called to receive in∣formation of the dangers, and to provide remedies, for the safety of the publique. Like as the dangers discovered unto them, were made publikely known and with the advice of the Commssioners of the ge∣nerall Assembly, the remedies also were agreed upon and published in print. Amongst these remedies a chiefe one was, to consider of the renewing of a league and associati∣on
with England, for defence of Religion, and the mutuall peace of the Kingdomes against the com∣mon enemy, and how farre the same might be ex∣tended against Prelacie and popish Ceremonies for uniformity in Kirk-government, and the externall worship of God, as is more fully expressed in the Remonstrance of the remedies of the dangers of Religion. But before the Convention of Estates had entered upon this grave consideration Commis∣sioners came from both Houses of the Parliament of England, warranted and authorized to propound their desires of the same union & strait conjunction of the two Nations, against Papists, and Prelates, with their adherents; And to consider with the Estates of this Kingdome, of such articles or Pro∣positions, as might make the assistance and union betwixt the two Nations more beneficiall and ef∣fectuall for the common security of Religion and Liberty. Upon the manifestation of this concurse of the strong inclinations and desires of the Estates of both Kingdomes, with which the Generall As∣sembly, did most unanimously and heartily joyne their desires, counsels, and prayers, a Committee of the Convention of Estates, and a Committee of the Generall Assembly, were appointed to meet, with the Commissioners of the Houses of Parliament, for considering the best and readiest waies, by which
these common desires and conceptions might be ripened and brought forward toward perfection, and (if it were possible) to birth and action, for the comfort of both Kingdomes, in Religion and peace. These three Committees after some meetings for debate and deliberation, did resolve in end, that, according to the commendable practice of the two Kingdomes in former times of distresse and danger, the example of the people of God in other Nations, in the like case; and the late example of the Kirke and Kingdome of Scotland, the best and most effectuall meanes for preserving Religion, and both kingdomes from utter ruine and destruction, and for procuring peace, and all other blessings, were: That both kingdomes enter into a solemne League and Covenant to be sworne and subscribed by His Majesties Subjects of all degrees in both kingdomes, who love the true Protestant, reformed Religion, His Majesties honour and safety, and their owne happinesse: And therefore they did with common consent agree upon the first lineaments and principall parts of a Covenant, to be offered to the view, and to be considered by the wisedome of the full Assembly of the kirke, and Convention of Estates, which, how soone it was presented unto them, and read once and againe in their audience, did so affect their hearts, that the fire which had made them to melt in teares at the solemnizing of
the Nationall Covenant of this kingdome, did be∣gin to burn againe, and bring forth the sparkles of the like affection; and withall did fill them with confidence and hope, that the Lord, inclining the hearts, of the Houses of Parliament, and of the gra∣cious and wel-affected people of England, to joyn in this Covenant, they wil thereby find an answer from Haaven to all the prayers, which they have offered up with strong crying and teares a deliverance from all their sufferings and feares, and the beginning of a new World of joy and peace, which the Lord will create for their comfort. But we know on the other part, upon the swea∣ring and subscribing of this Covenant by true Chri∣stians and Patriots, the opposite and malignant party of Papists, Prelates, and others the sonnes of defection and contention their adherents, will rage and tumultuate more then ever before. And there∣fore, unlesse we will either betray our Religion, Li∣berties, and Lawes, and all that we and ours doe possesse, into their hands and suffer our selves to be cut off and massacred by such bloody and barba∣rous cruelty, as they have executed this time past in Ireland and England, there is a necessity of taking of Armes for mutuall defence, in the cause of Religi∣on, of the Kings honour, of the liberty and peace of the kingdomes, and of every one of us in our own private estate and condition. In this case it is most
necessary, that every one against all doubting be per∣swaded in his minde of the lawfulnesse of his under∣taking, and of the goodnesse of the Cause maintained by him, which is no other, then the good of Religi∣on in England, and the deliverance of our Brethren out of the depths of affliction, the preservation of our owne Religion, and of our selves from the extremity of misery, and the safety of our native King, and his kingdomes from destruction and desolation: Any one of which, by all Law divine and humane, is too just cause of taking of armes, how much more when all of them are joyned in one? Whosoever with∣draweth and hideth himself in such a debate and con∣troversie, let him consider, whether he be not a hater of his Brethren against Christian and common chari∣ty; an hater of himselfe and his posterity against the law and light of nature; A hater of the King and his kingdomes, against loyalty and common duty; And a hater of God againstall Religion and Peace. Concerning the first, The question is not, nor need we dispute, whether we may propagate our Religion by Armes, but whether, according to our power wee ought to assist our Brethren in England, who are cal∣ling for our help, and are shedding their blood in de∣fence of that power, without which, Religion can nei∣ther be defended nor reformed, nor unity of Religion with us, and other reformed Kirks be attained: who have in the cause of Religion, and the like exigence
assisted us and other reformed Kirks: to whom, of old and of late, we have made promises of the reall Decla∣rations of all Christian duty and thankfulnesse; And who, upon our desires and their indeavours for unity in Religion, have often warned us, that the malignant party would bend all their invention and forces to in∣terrupt the work, and to ruine & destroy them in the undertaking of it, which we see this day come to passe. The question is no sooner rightly stated, but it is as soone resolved: the Lord save us from the curse of Me∣roz, who came not to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty: when we look upon the Cause which they maintaine, the prayers, teares, and blood which they have powred forth, and the insolencies and blasphe∣mies of the enemies, we cannot doubt, but inlarge∣ment and deliverance shall arise unto England; but we have reason to feare, if we upon so faire a calling, sit still and hold our peace, this kirke and kingdome shall perish by the hand of the same enemy, and there shall be none to deliver us: And who knowes, whether the Lord hath granted us mercy, furnished us with men of war, put weapons in our hands; and called this great Councel of the Estates, for warrant & direction for such a time as this? God forbid, and be it far from us to sit downe at ease (if wee may promise to our selves ease) on this side of Jordan, till our Brethren be possessed in the liberties of the kingdome of Christ. Neither concerning the second, is the question (as
our enemies would make it) whether wee shall enter into England, and lift armes against our owne King, who hath promised and done as much as may secure us in our Religion and Liberties; but whether against the Popish, Prelaticall, and malignant party their ad∣herents, prevailing in England and Ireland, wee be not bound to provide for our owne preservation. Al∣though it had not beene often told us from England, and the reformed kirks in other places, wee might of our selves have knowne from our continuall experi∣ence ever since the time of our first reformation, espe∣cially after the two kingdomes have been united un∣der one Head and Monarch, from the Principles of our own Declarations, in the time of our late troubles and dangers, from the vindictive disposition of the enemies of this kirke and kingdom (which they con∣ceive to be the fountaine whence have issued all these evils) and from the grounds of common reason, That we cannot long like Goshen, enjoy our light, if darke∣nesse shall cover the face of other reformed kirks? that Juda cannot long continue in liberty, if Israel be led away in captivity, and that the condition of the one kirke and kingdome, whether in Religion or Peace, must be common to both? If England shall sub∣due the enemies of Religion without that assistance which they call for from us at this time, what help can we expect from them in the houre of our tentation, which we have deserved, and the Lord may bring up∣on
us when he will. God forbid, that we should give them cause to laugh at our calamity, and mock when our feare commeth; and if they shall be given over in∣to the hand of the Enemy (which God in his mercy avert) will not the enemy strengthened with increase of power, be the more insolent and unresistable, and will not the power of England, turned into the hands of Malignants, turne also enemy against this Kinke and kingdome, and upon such pretences as be already invented, and yet (they will alledge) according to the late. Treaty of peace, within three Moneths space, denounce a nationall war against us. And concerning the third the question is not, whe∣ther we should presume to be Arbitrators in the mat∣ters now debated by fire and sword; betwixt his Ma∣jesty and the houses of Parliament which may seeme to be forraigne and extrincecall to this Nation, and wherein we may be conceived to have no interest, but whether our mediation and intercession being re∣jected by the one side, upon hope of victory; or sup∣pose, by both sides, upon confidence of their owne strength, and severall successes, it be not our duty, it being in our power, to stop or prevent the effusion of Christian blood? Or whether we ought not to en∣deavour to rescue Our Native King, his Crowne and Posterity out of the midst of so many dangers, and to preserve his people and kingdome from ruine and de∣struction? If every private man be bound in duty to
interpose himselfe as a reconciler and sequestrator betwixt his neighbours, armed to their mutuall de∣struction? if the sonne ought to hazard his owne life for the preservation of his Father and brother at va∣riance the one against another? Shall a kingdome sit still and suffer then king and neighbouring kingdome to perish in an unnaturall war. In the time of animo∣sity and appetire of revenge, such an interposing may be an irritation: But afterwards, when the eyes of the mind no more blood-run with passion, doe discerne things aright, it shall be no grief, nor offence of heart, but matter of thanksgiving to God, and to the Instru∣ments which have kept from shedding of blood, and from revenge. The Covenant is now solemnly taken in England, and is countenanced there already from heaven with marvellous successe. The Propositions and Articles of the Treaty are with wonderfull unanimity conclu∣ded in both houses of Parliament, cessation of armes is agreed upon with the Irish Rebels, and they, notwith∣standing all the barbarous and unparalleld cruelty ex∣ercised by the upon the Protestants & people of God in that kingdome, honoured with the title of his Ma∣jesties Subjects; It is therefore now high time for all true hearted Scottish men and good Patriots abroad, especially such as upon faire and plausible pretences have been formerly mistaken or seduced to take arms against this Cause of God and Religion, timely to re∣member
their nationall Covenant, and seriously to bethink themselves of the duty, which by so manifold Obligation they owe to their Religion and native Countrey in this time of so great distresse and danger to both; lest, despising or neglecting this our warning and intimation, they either perish by wilfull persisting in their own wayes against God, their Countrey, and Covenant; or come too late, & there be no place left for repentance. It is also most necessary for all the good people of all ranks and degrees within the king∣dome, to deny themselves and their own ease, or what earthly thing is dearest unto them, to lift up their eyes and behold the worke of God unto which they are called; and with heart & hand to joyn in this so reli∣gious, so just, and so necessary expedition, and which upon the truth of God, our own late comfortable and never to be forgotten experience, and the prayers of the people of God, we may be assured, will, in end, a∣gainst all difficulties and opposition, be crowned with such successe, as may be honour to God, confusion to his presumptuous and incorrigible enemies, propaga∣tion to the true Religion, and comfort to all the un∣feigned lovers of truth and peace, which against all calumny and contradiction hath been, is, and shall be the summe of our desires. FINIS.
