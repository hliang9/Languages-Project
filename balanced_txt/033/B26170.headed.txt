By the Mayor. arms of London To the Alderman of the Ward of WHEREAS the frequenting and tipling in Taverns, Alehouses, Coffee-houses, and other Victualling-houses, is too much used and practised within this City on the LORD's-DAY, to the great dishonour and scandal of the Reformed Religion: And althô the same is provided against by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and certain Penalties are thereby inflicted upon Transgressors, yet the same are little observed thrô the remiss Execution of the said Laws; And Men thrô Impunity presume to employ and mispend their Time on that Day in such Publick-Houses, which ought to be employed in God's Publick Worship and Service, or private Acts of Piety and Devotion, as the Christian Religion requires, and the said Laws enjoyn. Wherefore to the end, That as much as in me lies (with the help and concurrence of You and the rest of my Brethren the Aldermen) the said Laws may be better ob∣served, and that loose Practice prevented within this City and the Liberties thereof; These are in Their Majesty's name, to desire and require You, to take all possible care within your Ward (with the assistance of your Deputy and Common Council Men, and the several Constables and Churchwardens in Your Ward, whom You are to call before You for that purpose, and give them a strict Charge in this behalf, That the Lord's Day may for the future be more Religiously and Duly observed, and all Persons deterred from the Profanation thereof, by the strict and constant Execution of the Laws against Offenders; And that you charge and enjoyn the respective Constables and Churchwardens duly every Lord's Day, frequently in the Day-time and in the Evening, to search all Publick Houses (as well Coffee-Houses as others) and where they find any Persons tipling therein, that they take and set down their Names and Places of Abode, and from time to time certifie Me (or some other Justice of the Peace for this City) thereof; As also of the Housekeeper who shall harbour them; That the Penalties by Law in that case appointed may be duly and impartially levied, both upon the Persons tipling and also the Housekeeper; Which (the Offence being seen by a Justice of Peace, or proved before him by Two Witnesses) is Three shillings Four pence to be paid by every Person so unduly tipling, and Ten shillings by the Housekeeper, for the Poor of the Parish where such Offence is committed, (to be levied by the Constable or Churchwardens by Distress, if not paid within Six days:) And the Constables and Church∣wardens, for not doing their Duty therein, are to forfeit Forty shillings, to be levied by a Warrant from a Justice of Peace, for the use of the said Poor; Which Penalties are thought fit to be here set down, in order to the better putting the Laws in Execution. And You are also to cause Your Beadle, to give Notice to all Alehouse and Coffeehouse-keepers within Your Ward, That (besides levying upon them the aforesaid Penalty of Ten shillings for every Offence) they must expect to be sup∣pressed, and have their Licenses taken from them, in case they shall for the future permit Company to sit tipling in their Houses on the Lord's-Day: And Your are desired frequently to send for the said Constables and Churchwardens, and examine their Performance therein, and to take care that such as You shall find Remiss may undergo the Penalty of the Law. Herein Your especial Care is required, as You tender God's Honour and the Weal of this City. Dated this 15th Day of October, 1669. Wagstaffe.
