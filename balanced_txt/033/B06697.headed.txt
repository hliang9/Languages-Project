A Wonderful Example of God's Justice shewed upon one Jasper Conningham A Gentleman born in Scotland, who was of Opinion, that there was neither GOD, nor Devil. To the Tune of, O Neighbour Robert. IT was a Scotch-man, a Scotch-man, lewd of life, That long had lived unlawful from his Wife: His name was Jasper Conningham as I did understand, Whose dwelling was at Aberdeen, a Town in fair Scotland. He had a Sister which was both fair and bright, Worshipfully Weded, unto a worthy Knight; Godly, wise, and vertuous, in every thing was she, A fairer comely Lady in Scotland could not be. Her wicked Brother such inward pains did prove, That with his Fair Sister he greatly was in love: He watches time and wooes her, he shews to her his mind, And still he says swéet Sister, be not to me unkind. This comely Lady in mild and gentle wise, Vnto her brother thus modestly replyes: The Lord forbid, dear Brother, I should consent at all, To such a damned action, to bring our Souls in thrall. Are not great torments prepar'd for hateful sin? Is not God as Rigteous as ever he hth been? Is not Hell prepared, with quenchless flames of fire, To give such wicked persons their due deserved hire, Wherefore dear Brother, repent and call for Grace, Let not these motions within your heart take place: Consider how to judgment we shall be one day brought, To answer for our Follies, which in our lives we wought. Her Brother hearing her Godly Christian talk, Within the Garden as they alone did walk; Blasphemously replyed, as shameless as he stood, Saying she had declar'd a Tale of Robin Hood. You are deceived, fair Sister, then said he, To talk of Heavens Glory, or Hells plagues unto me: These are devised Fables, to keep poor Souls in fear, That were by wise men written, though no such things there were. You speak of reckoning, and of a judgement-day, And after life is ended, and flesh consum'd away; And of a God most justly, will plague all things amiss, And those that do believe it, are much deceiv'd I wis. Alas, said he, my Sister, these things are nothing so; No God, nor Devil is biding, in Heaven nor Hell I know: All things are wrought by Nature; the Earth, the Air, the Sky There is no joy nor sorrow, after tht men do dye. Therefore let me have pleasure, while here I do remain, I fear not God's displesure, nor Hells tormenting pain: No sonner had he spoken this foul blasphemous thing, But that a heavy judgment upon him God did bring. For in the Garden, whereas he did abide, Suddenly a Fire sprung up on every side; Which round about inclosed this damned wretch that day, Who roar'd and cry'd most grievous but could not start away.
THis fearful fire, up to his knees did rise, Burning blew like Brimstone, in most outragious wise: The Lady which beheld it, ran crying in for aid, To pluck away her Brother, which in the fire staid. But nought prevailed, for all that they could do, Long Staves, and also Pitchforks, they reached him unto; Because they durst not venture near to the fiery flame, He taking hold upon them, to draw him out of the same. But not a finger nor hand that he could move, His Arms hung dead behind him, great pains that he did prove; And now he bands and curses that day that he was born, And wishs that his Carcass by Devils might be torn. Now I feel surely, quoth he; there is a God, That sorely doth plague me with his strong Iron Rod: O hide me from his presence, his looks are death to me, Nothing but wrath and vengeance about him do I see. I have despised him, but can no whit repent, My heart is hardned, my mind cannot relent, No pitty nor compassion, nor mercy is in store, For me vile wretched creature, despis'd for evermore. I am in Hell tormented, and to endless pain, Look how the Devils torment me in stretching every vein: Look how they swarm about me, O what hell fiends are these, Woe worth the time that ever I did the Lord displease. I burn in flaming fire, yet do no whit consume, My conscience doth torment me, that did in sin presume: Alas! my loving sister, now do I know full well, There is a God most righteous and eke a Devil in hell. And with these speeches his Eyes fell from his head, And by strings hung dangling below his Chin stark dead: See how the Devils, then he said, hath pluckt my eyes out quite, That always was unworthy to view the heavenly light. Then from his mouth there fell his foul blasphemous tongue, In very ugly manner, most piteously it hung; And there away he rotted, in all the Peoples sight, By Lice and filthy Vermine, it was consumed quite. With gastly groaning and shrieks that sounded high, Two hours after this Cursed Man did lye; And there at length he dyed, and then the fire ceas'd; His Carcass stunk more filthy than any Carrion Beast. No man was able for to endure the smell, Nor yet to come to bury him, as true Report doth tell; Vntill he was consumed he lay above the ground, The doors about the Garden, therefore was locked round. Let all Blasphemers take warning by this thing; Least that God's Vengeance they do upon them bring: And Lord grant all Christians thy holy Grace and fear, They may think on the punishment that Conningham had here.
