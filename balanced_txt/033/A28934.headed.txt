THE Negotiations OF THE EMBASSADORS Sent to the Duke of Savoy, BY THE Protestant Swiss-Cantons, In Favour of the Distressed Vaudois. Wherein there are many things ve∣ry Curious, and some Letters never before Published. Translated out of French. LONDON, Printed for R. Bentley, in Russel-street, in Covent-Garden. 1691.
A True Account of the NEGOTIATION, &c. THE Embassy which the Evangelick Swiss Cantons sent to the Duke of Savoy, in the Year 1686, to intercede with his Royal High∣ness in favour of the Protestant Churches of the Vallies, being a business of as much difficulty as importance; and because it may give occasion to some persons of making different and quite con∣trary reflections, I have thought
fit to publish a true account of that Negotiation, that unbyass'd Persons, being rightly inform'd of what pass'd, may, according to Reason, justly and equitably judge of it. I will therefore relate the most considerable Passages of this Em∣bassie; and as I will make use of no Memoirs but what are good and authentick; so neither Inte∣rest, Hatred, or Affection shall in∣fluence my Pen; and then if the elegancy of my Stile do not please the Reader, yet I hope he will be satisfied with the sincerity and truth of the Narration. It is certain, that of all Prote∣stant States, the Evangelique Can∣tons have shewed as much love to their Religion as any, by their so zealously espousing the interest of the Reformed Churches; for ever since the light of the Reformation first begun to shine in France, they have, to the utmost of their power,
endeavour'd to forward the work of God in that Kingdom, and did send several Ambassadours to Francis the First, and likewise to succeeding Kings, to desire there might be a cessation of those Cruelties which were practised by the Romish Clergy against those Faithful People who made pro∣fession of the Truth. And they have made the same Zeal appear in all the Persecutions which the Churches of Piemont have suffer'd; for in those which were in the years 1655 and 1663, they sent Ambassadors to the Duke of Savoy, to mediate with him in behalf of his Protestant Subjects, and to support them in those Rights, which by several Grants they had obtain'd from his Ancestors. In 1686, as soon as they heard what was contain'd in the Edict which that Prince had published against their Brethren of Piemont, it plain∣ly appear'd how much they were
troubled; for when the miserable Vaudois were intolerably and most unjustly oppress'd, and still threat∣ned to be treated with all imagin∣able cruelties, the Cantons resolv'd to do all they could to shelter and save those poor persecuted People. In former times nothing more was design'd against them by their Enemies, than to coop up those poor Protestants within certain bounds and limits, and to take from them their right of living in the plain Country, which former∣ly they had liberty to do; but now a resolution was taken, not only to deprive them of the exer∣cise of their Religion in all places, but also of the liberty of their Consciences; so that now their condition did indeed deserve com∣passion; and that People may the better judge of it, 'tis necessary here to insert a true Copy of the Duke's Edict faithfully translated.
Victor Amadeus, by the Grace of God, Duke of Savoy and Pie∣mont, and King of Cyprus. CHristian Prudence and Policy do many times counsel Men in some manner to neglect those Sores and Ʋlcers which are not in a con∣dition to be perfectly healed, but may grow worse by too hosty a cure. This course hath been taken in other Monarchies, and by our most Serene Predecessors, who indeed never had any other intention than to draw their Subjects, who profess'd the pretended Reformed Religion, out of the dark∣ness of Heresy, which by the unhap∣py vicissitude and fatal corruption of times, hath from the centre of the Vallies of Luzerne, spread it self so far as to enter into the very heart of Piemont: And because those Religionists have had Succours from foreign Countries, this good work could never be brought to its
desired end; so that we not being able to purge this Poison quite out of our Country, we stopp'd and shut it up in the Vallies of Luzerne, Angrogne, St. Martin, Ceruse, St. Bartlemy, Roccapiata, and Pe∣rustin, and by Toleration only suf∣fer'd them to exercise their false Re∣ligion within certain prescrib'd li∣mits, complying with the necessity of the times, till it should please God to afford us a more favourable op∣portunity to bring back these wan∣dring Souls to the bosom of the Holy, and only Catholick, Apostolick, Ro∣man Religion: But time having now discover'd the necessity of quite destroying this Serpent, and many-headed Hydra; since the aforesaid Hereticks, instead of answering this favour with humble submission and thanks, for our gracious Permission and Toleration, have often, with scandalous disobedience, insolently re∣belled against us: And whereas the chief cause of granting such a Tole∣ration
now ceaseth, by the Zeal and Piety of that Glorious Monarch the King of France, who hath brought back again his Neighbour Hereticks to the true Faith; we think the particular favours which we have received from the Divine Majesty, and which we still enjoy, may ac∣cuse us of great ingratitude, if, by our negligence, we let slip the op∣portunity of perfecting this work, according to the intention of our Glorious Predecessors. For the causes aforesaid, and for other pressing Rea∣sons, by virtue of this present Edict; we, of our certain knowledge, by our absolute Sovereign Power, and by the advice of our Privy Council, have Decreed, and Ordain'd, and we do Order and Command by these Presents, all our Subjects of the Pre∣tended Reformed Religion, for the time to come, to forbear all Exer∣cises of the said Religion, and we forbid them henceforth to Assemble in any Place or private House to
exercise the said Religion, under any Title, Pretext, or Occasion what∣ever, upon pain of Death and Con∣fiscation of Goods. In like manner, we Ordain that the past pretended Toleration be utterly void, and of no effect, what colour or pretence soever may be alledged to the con∣trary. Our Will and Pleasure also is, That all Churches, Granges, and Houses wherein the said Religion is at present exercised, be pull'd down and raz'd, as also all other Places wherein for the future there may be any such Assemblies, contra∣ry to the Tenour of the preceding Article, yea, tho' the Persons to whom such Places belong know no∣thing of such Meetings. We fur∣ther Command all Ecclesiasticks, all Ministers and Schoolmasters of the said pretended Reformed Religion, who, within Fifteen days after the Publication hereof, shall not embrace the Catholick Religion, to depart out of our Dominions at the expiration of
the said term af Fifteen days, un∣der pain of Death, and Confiscation of their Goods; with express Com∣mand also, under the same Penal∣ties, that during the said term, before their departure, they do not Preach any Sermons, Exhort, or do any other Acts of their said Reli∣gion. Moreover, we forbid all that profess the pretended Reformed Re∣ligion, under the aforesaid Penal∣ties, and that of incurring our dis∣pleasure, to keep for the future a∣ny School, Publick or Private; that their Children may henceforth be in∣structed by Catholick Schoolmasters. As concerning those Ministers, who during the said term shall embrace the Catholick Religion, our Will is, that during their lives, and after their death their Widows shall dur∣ing their Widowhood, enjoy the same Exemptions and Immunities which they before had, during the Exercise of their Charge. And our further Pleasure is, That to those Ecclesi∣asticks
who shall in this manner be converted, there be paid, during their life, a Pension, which shall be a third part greater than the Wages which they had as Ministers of the said Religion; and that after their death their Widows shall receive the Moiety of that Pension so long as they continue sole. For what concerns the Children that shall be born of Parents of the said pretend∣ed Reformed Religion, our Pleasure is, That after the publication of this present Edict, they be baptis'd by the Priests of the Parishes which are already established in the said Vallies, or which shall be established hereafter. We therefore Command their Fathers and Mothers, that they either send or bring their Chil∣dren to the Churches, under the Pe∣nalty of the Father's serving Five years in the Gallies and the Mothers being publickly whipp'd: and the said Children shall henceforward be brought up in the Roman Catholick,
Apostolick Religion. We expresly Command all Judges, Provosts, Cha∣telains, and other Officers, to see that these Presents be duly execu∣ted. We also confirm the Edict which we caused to be Publish'd the 4th of November last past, concerning the Subjects of his Most Christian Ma∣jesty, who profess the pretended Re∣formed Religion, who are now in our Dominions, or who have left in them any Merchandise, Money, or other Effects, and for what concerns o∣ther Strangers of the said Religion, who contrary to the tenour of our Predecessors Edicts, have settled themselves in the Vallies, without their consent shew'd in writing, comprehending also their Descendants, who have been born in it: We Com∣mand, that in case they do not with∣in Fifteen days after the Publication of this Edict, declare they will em∣brace the Roman Catholick Aposto∣lick Religion, they shall be obliged, that term being expired, to depart
out of our Territories, under pain of Death, and Confiscation of their Goods. And tho' by virtue of our Predecessors Edicts, the Goods which such Strangers have gotten in our Dominions, ought of right to be ap∣plyed to our Publick Treasury; ne∣vertheless, intending in this case to shew our wonted Clemency, we per∣mit them to sell their Goods within the said term, and to dispose of them as they please; yet always with this condition, that there shall be no sale of their Lands, but to Roman Catholicks; and if no such Buyers can be found, the Goods shall be prized, sold, and annexed to our Demeans at a reasonable price. Last∣ly, we command all Magistrates, e∣stablish'd by us, all Ministers of State, Officers, Counsellors of Ju∣stice and War, and all others who are concern'd, to see that this Edict be inviolably observed, and cause the Council of Piemont to Register it, and give their entire approbation
to every thing therein contain'd· And moreover our Will is, That the Publication which shall be made of this Edict, in all Places, according to the usual form, shall have the same force and virtue, as if it had been notified to every particular Person; and that as much credit be given to the Copy Printed by Sinibal our Printer, as to the Original it self, for such is our Will and Plea∣sure. Given at Turin, the 31th of January, 1686. Victor Amadeo. V. Simione de St. Thomas. By the Command of his Royal Highness. The Evangelique Cantons hav∣ing heard of this Edict, a while after also knew that the Vaudois had in vain sought relief against it; for they had presented Two Petitions to their Prince, which were never answer'd. By the First, they desir'd a Revocation of this Edict; and by the Second, leave to depart out of his Dominions,
within such a term as might be necessary to find a settlement else∣where. The Cantons seeing that the ordinary means which had been used to stop the execution of this Edict had not been effectual, they thought some extraordinary course was to be tryed. They therefore at first wrote to the Duke of Savoy, Praying that he would make good to his Subjects of the Vallies those Concessions which had been granted to them by his Predecessors: But when they saw the Duke delay'd to give them any answer, and that they knew he prepar'd to execute his Edict by force, they resolv'd in a Diet held at Baden, in the Month of Fe∣bruary, 1686, to dispatch two Ambassadours to him, to endea∣vour the obtaining, by their Re∣presentations, that which they could not procure by their Letters. The Persons pitched upon for this Embassie were Gaspard de Mu∣ralt,
and Bernard de Muralt, both Councellours of State; the First, of the Republick of Zurich, the other of Berne; who had all qua∣lities necessary to fit them for such an Employ, either in respect of their Virtue and Piety, or of their Prudence and Personal Abilities. These Ambassadours were charg∣ed to use their best endeavours to oblige the Duke of Savoy to re∣voke the Edict which he had pub∣lished against the Valley Churches. And because they had reason to fear that his Royal Highness would continue firm in his Resolution of causing it to be executed in all points, the Protestant Cantons, after having maturely considered the state of the People that com∣pos'd the Churches, and the Alli∣ances and Forces of the Prince, who resolv'd totally to extirpate them, if they refus'd to submit to his Will, they thought, in case their Ambassadours could not ob∣tain
a Revocation of the Edict, that then it would be expedient for them to endeavour the procur∣ing of liberty for those miserable People to retire into some other Country, to sell their Goods, and to carry with them all that they could get together of their ship∣wrack'd Fortune. The Lords who were present in this Diet were too prudent and ju∣dicious to take any other course but this; they saw on the one hand, how few they were who could bear Arms in the Vallies; for they were at most but Two Thousand Five Hundred Men, the greatest part of them ill armed, and had neither Commanders, Pro∣vision, or Ammunition, and could not from any place expect Suc∣cours; that they likewise who had Commanded in the Wars of 1655 and 1664 were now all dead. But on the other hand, when they considered the Prince's
Forces, who had resolved to abo∣lish their Religion, they saw that they infinitely exceeded those of his Subjects, who were of a Re∣ligion contrary to his; for the Duke had enjoy'd a long Peace; he had a great many good Troops, brave Captains, and experienc'd Generals; he had nothing to fear, either from his Neighbours or any Prince in Europe. More than all this, the Duke of Savoy's Troops were joyn'd with those of the King of France, who was then so dreaded, that his very Name made all the Poten∣tates of Europe tremble; whereas heretofore though the Subjects of France fought together with the Vaudois, to assist and guard them from the oppression of their So∣vereign, yet, notwithstanding their being so aided, they were driven out of their Vallies, and could not defend themselves against the single Forces of their Prince. They far∣farther
considered, that if by some unexpected chance the Vau∣dois should at first have the good luck to get some advantage over their Enemies, yet in the end, they must needs be overpower'd by the great number of those that attack'd them, whose losses could be repaired by being recruited with new Troops; but the Vaudois could make no new Levies, to fill the places of those that must be flain in several Combats. More than all this, the Vaudois having to do with the King of France, who was the proudest Prince in the World, and who at that time had no Enemy upon his hands, he would have armed all the Peo∣ple of his Kingdom against them, rather than have fail'd to bring his design to pass, wherein he thought consisted his chiefest Glo∣ry, and by which he believ'd he should merit the highest Place a∣mong
the greatest Saints in Pa∣radise. The Cantons had before their eyes the French Protestants, whom they had receiv'd into their Ter∣ritories; and comparing their con∣dition with that of their Brethren of Piemont, they found that even in that miserable state to which they were reduced, the Vaudois being still able to obtain free leave to go out of their Country, were in that respect much happier than the French Protestants, who were not only obliged to quit their Houses and their Country, when all their Goods were taken from them, but yet could not buy their Banishment, without hazarding their Lives and their Liberty. All things thus considered, the Cantons at last concluded they could do nothing of more advan∣tage for the Piemontois, than to obtain for them that which they themselves had now, and hereto∣fore
desired when they were per∣secuted concerning the exercise of their Religion; for in former times they most humbly petition'd their Prince, that they might seek a retreat in Foreign parts. The Ambassadours furnished with these Instructions, went into Piemont; and being arrived at Turin, and admitted to Audience by his Royal Highness, they de∣clar'd, That seeing the mediation of their Masters, the Evangelique Cantons, with his Royal Highness, in favour of his Protestant Sub∣jects, had been always acceptable and effectual, their Sovereign Lords, having with extreme grief heard that his Royal Highness had resolved to deprive his Protestant Subjects of the liberty of their Consciences, and the exercise of their Religion, which they had enjoy'd for many Ages; their So∣vereigns moved by Christian Cha∣rity, by the strict union with
those of their Communion, and by the confidence they had in his Royal Highness's Clemency and Justice, had presumed to intercede by their Letters of Recommenda∣tion in favour of their Brethren of the Vallies. But having received no answer to those Letters, their Masters had charged them with this Embassie, to testifie the con∣sideration they had for his Royal Highness, and likewise to shew how much they were touched with the late Edict which had been pub∣lished against his Highness's poor Subjects, and had commanded them to assure his Highness how sincerely they regarded his Inte∣rests, and with all possible instance to pray him to suffer the Inhabi∣tants of the Vallies quietly and perpetually to enjoy the exercise of their Religion, and that liber∣ty of Conscience his Predecessors had granted to them, upon the pressing Intercessions and Recom∣mendations
of many Princes and Protestant States, and particular∣ly upon the Interposition and Me∣diation of their Sovereigns: And that which made them hope to obtain what they desired, was that his Highness's Subjects had done nothing to render themselves unworthy of the continuance of the Favour and Affection of their Prince, or that ought to deprive them of the right which they had acquired by his own concessions, which ought to be inviolable, be∣cause they were not bare and sim∣ple Tolerations, but Authentick Treaties, made with the Inhabi∣tants of the Vallies, and therefore ought to be perpetual and irrevo∣cable, as may be seen in the Twen∣tieth Article of the Grant pass'd in the year 1655, and the Fourth Article of the Patent in 1664, which declares, That they should be perpetually and irrevocably ob∣served; and that in effect they
have been Ratify'd and Register'd by the Senate of Chambery, to be Bona fide executed according to their Form and Tenour. That their Lords were verily persuaded, that his Highness in his own Reign, full of Glory and Felicity, would not suffer those Grants, follow'd with many De∣clarations and solemn Promises, to be made void, and all the fruit of their Mediation, Pains, and Care come to nothing. They hoped that his Highness would not have the World believe he had not the same esteem and regard for the Evangelique Can∣tons which his Predecessors had; or that the perfect Amity, and sincere Correspondence which hath always been between his Royal Highness and their Lords, as good Neighbours and Friends, was in any wise alter'd; that his State would be expos'd to troubles and calamities; that the Consciences
of his Subjects (which ought not to depend upon any but God a∣lone) would be forced, by the fear of Death and Torments: In a word, the Inhabitants of the Vallies would be overwhelm'd with Misery, and reduc'd to De∣spair. They also earnestly pray'd his Royal Highness, to receive fa∣vourably their Sovereign's Inter∣cession, in the behalf of his Sub∣jects, made their Brethren by Communion in one and the same Religion; and that he would suffer himself to be moved by the Cries, Tears, and Groans of so many innocent Souls, who did beseech him to suspend the Exe∣cution of his Edict, and not to turn his Arms against his People, who in rendering to God the Re∣ligious homage due to him, de∣sired, with the loss of their Blood, to seal the fidelity which they had vow'd to his Royal Highness.
That if their Mediation did produce the effect which their Superiours desired, it would be the most convincing evidence his Roy∣al Highness could give them, that he no less valu'd their Mediation than his Predecessors of Glorious Memory had done; and that on their part, they would endeavour by all manner of ways, to testifie their thanks, and to render his Highness reciprocal Services upon all occasions; and because, in the Conference which the Ambassa∣dours had with his Royal High∣ness's Ministers of State, some of those Reasons had been declared which his Royal Highness had to publish the Edict, whereof they desir'd the Revocation, the Am∣bassadours judg'd it necessary to answer those Reasons, to give o∣thers to back their own Demands, contain'd in the following Me∣moir.
His Royal Highness's Ministers of State having declar'd to us, when we discoursed privately with them, that the Engagement into which, by the necessity of the present juncture of Affairs, your Royal High∣ness was forced to enter, was a great obstacle to the success of our Nego∣tiation; we are oblig'd to repre∣sent to your Royal Highness, that the Valley-Churches of Piemont did never separate themselves from the Religion of their Prince; seeing they live in that which they re∣ceiv'd from their Ancestours more than Eight Hundred Years ago, and which they profess'd before e∣ver they were under the Govern∣ment of your Royal Highness's Pre∣decessours; who finding them in the possession of their Religion, have maintain'd them in it by several Concessions, and principally by those of the Years 1561, 1602, and 1603, which have been ratified by
the Senate, and by the Chamber, in the Year 1620, for the Sum of 6000 French Duccatoons, which those Churches paid, as by the very Act of Confirmation plainly appears; Their Right pass'd in form of a Treaty, and of a Law Perpetual, and Irrevocable; which was ob∣served during the life of his Royal Highness Victor Amadeus, and during the Regency of Madam Royale, which she confirm'd by an Ordinance, in the Year 1638: After this, these Churches obtain'd many other favourable Decrees of his Royal Highness Charles Emanuel, your Royal Highness's Father, of Glorious Memory; particularly in the Year 1649, and 1653; but because, contrary to a Right so well establish'd, by a Possession time out of mind, and by so many Grants, the Seignior Guastaldo, in the Month of January, 1655, caused an Edict to be publish'd, which produc'd terrible and fatal effects
against those poor Churches; all the Kings, Princes, and Protestant States of Europe, and among others our Sovereign Lords, compassionating their misery, became Mediators and Intercessors for them to his Royal Highness Charles Emanuel, and obtain'd a Confirmation of their Priviledges and Concessions by two solemn Patents, perpetual and in∣violable, in the Years 1655 and 1664, Ratified in due form, and Confirm'd by Letters which he wrote to our Superiours the 28th of Fe∣bruary, in the Year 1664; by which Letters he promis'd those Patents should Bona fide be Exe∣cuted; whereto Madam Royale, your Highness's Mother did likewise oblige her self, by her own Letters, Daied the 28. of January, 1679. So that your Royal Highness's Pre∣decessors having so many times pass'd their Royal Word, especially in the Patents given in the Presence of our Soveraigns Ambassadours, sent
for that purpose. It cannot be just to break so many formal and Au∣thentick Engagements; not only be∣cause those Concessions and Patents were agreed to in the face of all Europe, by the Interposition and Mediation of many Kings, Princes, and States, as perpetual Monu∣ments and Pledges of the Publick Faith; but also because the Words and Promises of Princes ought to be Sacred and Inviolable; for if such Engagements may be infring'd and made null, under pretence that a Prince is necessitated to it by the juncture of his Affairs, or for the advantage of them, there will be nothing certain in the World, and nothing but War and Confusion to be expected; If this Maxim be once estahlish'd among Soveraigns, Protestant Princes may destroy their Catholick Subjects, and Catholick Princes do the same to all the Pro∣testants in their Dominions. It is then certain, whether the thing be
considered either as it respects the Honour and Reputation of a Prince, or whether, it be consider'd with re∣gard to the Rules and Principles of true and just Policy, whose chief and only end, is the safety of Princes, People, and States; it will be found that the Words and Promises of Princes ought to be inviolable. 'Tis this which tells us, that nei∣ther the necessity of present Con∣junctures, nor any other Interest, can oblige a Prince so Just, Mer∣ciful, and Prudent as your Royal Highness, to enter into, or make good any new Engagements, which will not only overthrow all that your Predecessors have done in the sight of the whole World, but will also expose your own Dominions and Subjects to Fire, Sword, Misery, and Desolation, and to all that in Rage and Brutality is cruel and inhumane. We confess it natural for a Pious Prince to desire that there may be
but one Religion in all his Domini∣ons; and being perswaded that that which he himself professeth is the true, he may think Charity binds him to endeavour to make all his Subjects of his Religion; but it must be also confefs'd, That Religion, enters into our Hearts by Persuasion, not by Force and Compulsion; and to make Men taste Divine Verities, we ought to make use only of Instru∣ction, Exhortation, and gentle means, according to the practice of our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Apostles. Tho' Kings and Princes are Ma∣sters of their People, yet they have no Empire over their Consciences, which are subject to none but God; so that we have reason to hope your Royal Highness will be so far from forcing the Inhabitants of the Vallies to do things contrary to the dictates of their Consciences, that you will restore to them the Peace we implore for them; that you will confirm their Priviledges, and let them have they
liberty of rendring to God the Wor∣ship which is due to him, so long as they pay to you the respect and ho∣mage, which, as your faithful Sub∣jects, they owe to your Royal High∣ness. Your Highness's Ministers of State have also told us, That your Subjects of the Vallies have made themselves unworthy of their Prince's favour; but all the World knows, that before the Publication of your last Edict, they gave your Royal Highness no cause of Complaint; and therefore, 'tis not any ill behaviour of theirs that hath been the occa∣sion of so rigorous an Order against them: Beside, if any particular Persons among them since that time have committed any fault (which yet is more than we know) can a∣ny man wonder that miserable People, driven to absolute despair, should act imprudently? We hope your Royal Highness hath so much Goodness and Mercy, as to pardon faults of his nature, and you have too much
Justice and Equity to punish a whole Community for Disorders which may have been committed by a few private Persons. Lastly, it hath been pretended that the Patents which his Royal Highness Charles Emanuel granted in the years 1655, and 1664, did not concern Religion, but only gave the Protestants leave to dwell in some certain places of the Vallies; and therefore, neither our Soveraign Lords, nor other Princes who were Mediators and Intercessors in that Affair have any interest in this: But we pray your Royal Highness to consider, First, That the business then in agitation was Religion, and that directly no other thing was treated of: For beside Signior Guastaldo's Order, which was the cause of such dismal effects, and took away those Priviledges which had been granted to the Vaudois concerning Religion, there was then a design to force them to do things
contrary to their Consciences; for they were threatned with Death, and Confiscation of Goods, if within twenty days after they were com∣manded so to do, they did not em∣brace the Catholick Religion. Secondly, All the Mediation and Intercession of the Protestant Princes and States had no other foundation but that of Religion and Conscience; it was upon this very Principle they acted, and their Ambassadors had not been heard or received, but as they were concerned in a business re∣lating to their Religion; and it was for this Reason that your Highness's Predecessors, by their Letters, gave many assurances to their Excellencies the Evangelick Cantons, that the Patents which they had granted a their Intercession should be punctually and faithfully executed. Now because your Royal Highness hath publish'd an Edict, to take away all that was granted to them, which forbids them the Exercise of their
Religion in all the Vallies upon pain of Death; orders all their Churches to be demolish'd, banisheth their Mi∣nisters and Schoolmasters, commands all their Children to be baptis'd, and brought up in the Roman Religion, and consequently deprives the People of the liberty of their Consciences: Our Soveraign Lords, who are united to those Valley-Churches by the bonds of the same Faith and Belief, think them∣selves oblig'd to continue their Inter∣cessions for them, which we do in their name; hoping that your Royal Highness will have some regard for our Superi∣ours, and some pity for your own Subjects. The Ambassadors, having deli∣ver'd their Proposal and Memoir to the Marquess St. Thomas, one of his Royal Highness's Ministers of State, who had the direction of Forreign Affairs; some few days after receiv'd an Answer to it, ve∣ry much to the following purpose.
That his Royal Highness was very sorry he could not yield to what they desired in their Masters name; That he had much better Reasons to maintain his Edict, than those which were offered to him to revoke it: That he could not make it less strict in any particular: That the Great Wheels moved and carried on the less: That the Letter which the Cantons had written to him was not delivered till after the Publicati∣on of his Edict: That having so near him a King no less powerful than jealous of his Authority, he ought to be very circumspect: That he was oblig'd to act according to the pre∣sent juncture and state of Affairs. That even in Switzerland there was according to the tendency of Affairs, some times a necessity of taking resolutions contrary to those good intentions which otherwise Men might have: That the Marquess St. Thomas had given good and safe Counsel to the two Deputies sent by the Vallies to his High∣ness;
and that instead of giving any signs of their submission and obedience, to which they were bound, they had committed all sorts of Hostilities against his o∣ther Subjects; they had been guil∣ty of a thousand insolencies; they held Assemblies, provided Victu∣als and Ammunition for War, cut off Passes, and intrench'd them∣selves; all which they had done during the term of Twenty Five days given them for taking their last resolution. That the Duke was now too far engag'd; the Troops which he had been at great charge to levy, were already on Foot, that the Edict could not be recall'd without great dishonour to his Royal Highness, and that he was obliged to cause it to be exe∣cuted for very great and pressing Reasons, which he left to the Am∣bassadours consideration. That the Concessions of 1655, and 1664, amounted to no more than bare Tolerations; and that the Vallies
had no positive right to exercise their Religion: That Soveraign Princes do nothing that can be count∣ed unjust, in not suffering any more than one Religion in their Domi∣nions: That the Cantons them∣selves did justifie his Royal High∣ness in that particular, seeing they would suffer no Catholicks a∣mongst them: Moreover that the Concessions granted to those of the Vallies had been juridically examin'd, and that the result of that examination was, That the Priviledges and Favours which a Prince granted to his Subjects, might at his Will and Pleasure be revok∣ed: That his Royal Highness did only forbid the Inhabitants of the Vallies to exercise their Religion, but did not intend in any manner to offer violence to their Consciences. But the Ambassadours, by their Reply, made it appear to the Mar∣quess St. Thomas, That how strong soever the Reasons were which had induced his Royal Highness
to consent to his Edict of Januar last, yet they could not be of so great strength as those were which had positively engag'd his High∣ness to observe those Promises which were past before the said E∣dict; and that no Considerations, or Reasons of State could free a Prince from the Obligation of keeping his Word; especially when he engag'd himself upon the in∣terposition of some other Prince; and that as the Patents and Pri∣viledges granted to the Vaudois had been obtain'd by the Media∣tion of many Kings, Princes, and States; particularly by the In∣tercession of their Excellencies the Evangelick Cantons, and Con∣firm'd by his Royal Highness; nothing could be alledg'd to dis∣charge his Highness from his be∣ing oblig'd to cause them to be punctually observ'd; and the ra∣ther, because those Patents had been ratified by the Senate of Sa∣voy;
and that the bare Confirma∣tion of 'em in the Year 1620. had cost the Valley-Churches Six Thou∣sand Crowns. That if the changes which hap∣pen in States, or the different Measures which according to the Rules of Policy may be taken, should be valuable and sufficient Exceptions to elude the observa∣tion of Treaties, there could be nothing certain in Soveraigns Pro∣mises; Faith would be totally ba∣nish'd out of the World, and there could never be any assurance that those things should be performed which had been solemnly stipu∣lated, and there could be no way of ending War, or concluding Alliances. So that the Concessi∣ons granted by his Royal High∣ness's Predecessors to the Vaudois did convey to them an indisput∣able right, which they could ne∣ver lose, but by being guilty of some heinous Crime, or down∣right
Rebellion against their So∣veraign: But they are so far from being justly accus'd of having a∣ny way fail'd in their duty to him, that they can produce a Letter from his Royal Highness, dated the 2d of September, 1684, which is an authentick, and manifest Proof of their Fidelity, and their stedfast resolutions to serve him. If since the Publication of your last Edict, some particular Persons among them have taken Arms, it was not against their Soveraign, but only to defend themselves a∣gainst those, who, abusing his Au∣thority, had fallen upon, and as∣saulted them; and if any disor∣der had been committed, they on∣ly were to be chastised who had been the Authors of it; and it ought not to be imputed to the Collective Body of the Valley-Churches, who were no way guilty. It could not be said, That the
Vallies had not acquired any Right by the Concessions of his Royal Highness's Predecessors, or that those Concessions were but Favours and simple Tolerations; since it is plain, that they are Treaties past between the Prince and his Sub∣jects, and that these Treaties are perpetual and irrevocable, and ought to be inviolably observed. That a Prince is equally oblig'd to perform the Promises which he makes to his Subjects, as he is those which he makes to Persons not subject to him; that the founda∣tion of such Obligations was Pub∣lick Faith, which ought to govern in all Princes Treaties, without a∣ny distinction made between those with whom they enter into En∣gagements; for if it were lawful to fail in the performance of those solemn Promises they make to their People, it would be impossible to end any differences which might happen between them, or to ap∣pease
any troubles in Kingdoms or States; and that between two Parties in War with one another, there could be no end of their Quarrel, but by the entire ruine of one of them. They further said, That if So∣veraigns had reason to do what possibly they could to make all their Subjects of one Religion, yet to compass that, they ought not to infringe those Treaties they had made with them; and that the only means which in such a case were lawful to be used, was Instruction, Exhortation, and all those gentle ways which are like∣ly to make Truth enter into the Souls of their People, to enlighten their Understanding, and lead them voluntarily and sincerely to em∣brace true Religion: But that which deserves particular conside∣ration in this matter, is, That the Inhabitants of the Vallies do not hold by Grant from their Princes
the liberty of publickly exercising their Religion, it having been esta∣blish'd in the Country more than Eight Ages ago, and that they en∣joy'd this Right a long time before they were Subjects to the Ance∣stors of his Royal Highness; so that they never having been of their Prince's Religion, it cannot be said they have quitted it, or that they are obliged to embrace it. Beside, his Royal Highness's Pre∣decessors, who permitted the Vau∣dois to continue the exercise of their Religion, very well knew that Unity of Faith was not absolutely necessary for the Publick good and safety of their State; for other∣wise they would never have pass'd such solemn Patents, or from time to time confirmed them as they have done. And certainly there is little to be feared from the diversity of Re∣ligion which is in Piemont; because
those that are not of the Prince's Communion, are shut up in a little corner of the Country, and are a People without Authority or Power, and have no design to spread their Doctrine in any other parts of his Royal Highness's Do∣minions. Moreover, it was to be fear'd that Protestant Princes might fol∣low his Royal Highness's Example, and might treat their Catholick Subjects as his Highness dealt with those of their Religion; and there∣fore the Interest of his own Party ought to hinder him from using force to oblige the Inhabitants of the Vallies to renounce their Re∣ligion. That altho' his Royal Highness seem'd not to force his Protestant Subjects to embrace the Romish Religion, and was contented with depriving them of the exercise of their own Religion, leaving to them in other things perfect liber∣ty
of Conscience; yet it was evi∣dent that they were not only ob∣liged (under very great Penal∣ties) to baptise their Children in Catholick Churches, and to bring them up in the Romish Religion, which was as insupportable and grievous to them, as to compel the Parents themselves to make pro∣fession of it; but they were also kept from Praying to God accord∣ing to their Faith, which must be a terrible torment to their Consci∣ences, and was an imposition upon them as hard and cruel, as if they were by force compell'd to a Wor∣ship condemn'd by the Religion in which they were educated. Beside, to forbid People the ex∣ercise of their Religion, is to cast them into indevotion, and even into Atheism, which may prove a greater mischief to them, than driving 'em by force into the Church of Rome. In these Reasons there was so
much strength, that the Ambassa∣dors hoped they would make great impression on the mind of his Royal Highness; and that the Marquess St. Thomas would truly report them, and employ his credit with his Highness to obtain a Revocation of an Edict, which doubtless he believ'd to be just, and which he had not publish'd had he thought it contrary to what a just and equitable Prince owes to his faithful Subjects. The Ambassadors were not con∣tented with only representing the just Right of the Piemont Churches, and maintaining it by sollid Arguments, but they also spent some days in solliciting his Royal Highness's Ministers, and all others whose help they thought might make their Embassie succeed; but they more particularly apply∣ed themselves to the Marquess St. Thomas, as to him, on whom depended all the Good and all the
Ill which was to be expected in the Affair; and if one may judge of things by appearances, the pains they took to dispose him to be favourable to them were not in vain. For he protested with an Oath, That he had shew'd to his Royal Highness all that was contain'd in the Reply they had oblig'd him to present, and that he had done all he could to make their Arguments prevail for obtaining a Revocation of the Edict; but the present state of Affairs was the cause of his not being able to perswade his Royal Highness to grant that which they desired. However, said he, seeing the Prince's Troops are not yet upon their March, the Inhabitants of the Vallies may make a shew as if they would comply with the Edict; that not being contrary to the Prin∣ciples of your Religion, tho' it be to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church; and by this means they
will disarm the Prince, and after∣wards find some way to prevent the mischief wherewith they are threatned. Our Doctrine, replied the Am∣bassadours, doth in no wise allow us to dissemble our Faith, but obligeth us to confess with our Mouths that which we believe in our Hearts to be truth; but this is not the present business: The Question is, Whether his Royal Highness hath power to revoke the Priviledges granted to the Valley Churches; for as they are Engagements into which he en∣tred by the Mediation of many So∣veraigns, and among others, by that of the Evangelick Cantons our So∣veraign Lords, it is certain that no∣thing ought to infringe or make them void. The Ambassadours in the mean time neglected nothing that might make their Negotiation success∣ful, and therefore made new ap∣plications to the Marquess St. Tho∣mas,
and to others of his Royal Highness's Ministers, but they all said (as if they had concerted what answer to give) that the E∣dict was irrevocable, by reason of the present juncture, and the mea∣sures which his Royal Highness had taken. Beside the Reasons drawn from the Nature of the Grants pass'd to the Vaudois, and the concern which the Cantons had that they should be observ'd, the Ambassadours represented the inconveniencies which might follow the execution of the Edict▪ and among others, those which his Royal Highness might well fear would happen by the entry of Foreign Troops into his Country, by the loss of a great number of his Subjects, who had done their Prince very great service, and were still ready to lose their Blood to restifie the love they had for him: By the dimi∣nution of his Revenue, which
must necessarily follow the destru∣ction of those miserable People; and to which might be added, the blame his Royal Highness must incur, by turning his Arms a∣gainst his own People, and the damage which his other Subjects, who were Neighbours to the Val∣lies, must needs suffer by a Civil War, with many other Conside∣rations of this nature, which were not regarded by his High∣ness's Ministers; who told the Ambassadours, That the Council of State had examin'd their Rea∣sons, and did not think them weighty enough to hinder him from Publishing his Edict against his Subjects of the Vallies; and tho' by the execution of it, his Royal Highness might suffer some inconvenience, yet he must go on, because a change of this nature would be prejudicial to his Au∣thority; and by being willing to preserve some of his Subjects, he
might be in danger of losing all. Tho' the Ministers of State seem'd to be firm in their Opini∣ons, and pretended not to be con∣vinced of the Justice of the Am∣bassadours Demands, yet it was well known, that they maintain'd the Edict against their own judg∣ment; and one of them freely confess'd, that his Highness's Coun∣cil had not sufficiently examin'd the Concessions of the Year 1655, and 1664; and if they had made such reflections on them as they ought, they would never have been of the opinion that they might be revoked: But he told the Ambassadours the mischief was not now to be remedy'd, and it would be in vain for them to sol∣licit his Highness to change his mind. Another of them freely confess'd that his Highness was not Master of this Affair, and that those Orders must be exe∣cuted
at Turin, which had been given at Versailles. This free and sincere Confession made the Ambassadours conclude, That all their Instances and Sol∣licitations would prove ineffectual; so that seeing it would be impos∣sible for them to obtain the Re∣vocation of the Edict, they were resolved, according to the first Article of their Instructions, to demand that which they were by the second Article of the Cantons Orders directed to ask, viz. To procure leave for the Vaudois to retire some where else, and to di∣spose of their Goods as they should think fit. But because by their Instructi∣ons they were to propose nothing in this particular to the Court of Turin, without the consent of the Valley Inhabitants, they told the Marquess St. Thomas, That seeing many Considerations had hinder'd them from entertaining any cor∣respondence
mith the Vaudois, they were willing to go into the Vallies, to know certainly how the People stood dispos'd; and when they understood their intentions, they might by some other Overtures renew their Negotiation; but at the same time declared, they would not undertake the Voyage without first having his Royal Highness's consent. The Marquess St. Thomas hav∣ing reported to his Royal High∣ness the Ambassadours design, the Duke sent to let them know, he approv'd of their resolution, and that he would give order to the Governour of Lucern, to pay them all the civility and respect that was due to their Character. The Ambassadours, as soon as they came into the Vallies, made known their arrival to all the Communities, who presently sent to 'em their Deputies and their
Ministers, to whom the Ambassa∣dours declared, That they had em∣ploy'd the most powerful Interces∣sions they possibly could, to get a Revocation of the Edict of the 31th of January; but that they had been told his Royal Highness had entred into such strict engage∣ments with one of the most Po∣tent Monarchs on Earth, that it was impossible for his Highness to break 'em; and that he had resolved to do all he could to u∣nite all his Subjects in the Pro∣fession of one and the same Reli∣gion, according as he had solemn∣ly promis'd; so that there was not the least hope of obtaining a Revocation of those Orders which had been given out against them. They also declared, that their So∣veraign Lords the Cantons had commanded them, in case his Roy∣al Highness should persist in his resolution of causing his Edict to be executed, then to press his
Royal Highness to permit his Subjects of the Vallies to depart out of his Dominions, and to dis∣pose of their Goods; but in that particular they would do nothing till they first knew what was their intention, and therefore they wish'd them to meet together, and seriously deliberate upon a business of so much weight, and then make known what they desired of them in the present juncture. The Deputies and the Ministers having conferr'd together upon this Proposition, before they de∣termin'd any thing, pray'd the Ambassadours to give them their prudent advice: But the Ambas∣sadours at first refused to give them any counsel in so nice a bu∣siness; saying, That they them∣selves knew their own Strength, the situation of those Places where they intended to intrench; their Provisions both for the Belly and
the War, better than they whose advice they ask'd; and therefore they could take better and surer measures themselves, than could be given them by others. Nevertheless, at last, not be∣ing able to deny their earnest Re∣quests, and believing they were bound by Charity to assist them in a Concern so slippery, and full of hazard, they willingly consent∣ed to what they desired. But that they might give them Counsel according to the know∣ledge they had of their condition, they informed themselves exactly of the number of those in the Vallies that could bear Arms; of their Experience, their Courage, and of the service of their Offi∣cers, of the Passages and Avenues of the Country, of their Stores, of the quality and goodness of their Arms; and above all, whe∣ther there were a perfect and sin∣cere Union among themselves:
But understanding that at most they were not above 2500 fight∣ing Men, and more than 12000 unprofitable Mouths; that Victu∣als already began to fail in cer∣tain places; that the Troops of France and Savoy had shut up all the Passages whereby they might be provided of necessaries; that they could not hope for any Suc∣cours; and that it was easie to destroy them by Famine, or to reduce them by Force; that they had no Neighbours to retreat to as in former Wars; that the King of France, who heretofore pro∣tected them, was now their great∣est Enemy; that they had but few Soldiers to defend a great deal of Ground; that being sepa∣rated one from another, they could not give speedy succour to those that might want it; that there were in the Vallies Roman Catho∣licks, who would watch all their motions, and give intelligence to
the Court of all that pass'd; and what was yet worse, that two great Princes had join'd together to destroy them: The Ambassa∣dours told them, That in the state wherein they were, it was impossi∣ble to resist so great a Force as was ready to fall upon them; and there∣fore it would be more for their ad∣vantage to chuse forsaking their Country, provided they could ob∣tain leave to sell their Goods, and save as much as they could. They did not▪ indeed know positively his Royal Highness's intention in this particular; but tho' he had refused to grant that which the Inhabi∣tants of the Vallies had requested of him in the third Petition they had presented to his Highness, yet they did hope it might now be yield∣ed to, out of respect to their Ma∣sters. The Ministers and Deputies hav∣ing heard this advice, intreated the Ambassadours that they might
consult together before they gave any answer; and then quitting them, they spent more than three hours in consulting one with a∣nother, each Party maintaining their own Opinion with a great deal of heat: Some said they ought not to quit their Country, but expose their Lives to maintain their Liberties, which had been so Au∣thentickly granted to them; say∣ing, it was base Cowardise not to shew their Courage, when Religi∣on and the Cause of God was at stake; that the favour which was to be shown them, would signifie nothing, to such as had not where∣withal to defray the charges of their Voyage; that they might in∣deed sell what they had in the Plains, but no body would buy their E∣states in the Mountains. That there was no safety for them during their departure; that some change might happen in the Affairs of Europe, which might better their Con∣dition.
That perhaps France, think∣ing they could make no Resistance, when it saw how bravely they defended themselves, and that they had destroy'd part of their Troops, would recal the rest, and keep them for some more considerable En∣terprise; that they expected Mony and Men, which were to be sent them by Captain Janavell, and that they should not want Victu∣als, because by Sallies from time to time, they could oblige their Neighbours to furnish them with such Necessaries as they wanted. They that were of a contrary Opinion, answer'd all this, saying, It was true, that both Reason and Piety oblige us, to hazard our Lives in defence of our Liberty, and the Exercise of our Religion, when there is any appearance it may be done with Success; but when the danger is inevitable, and our ruin certain, it is Despair and Madness to throw our selves
headlong into it, and Men are their own Enemies and Self-Mur∣therers, to take Arms against those, whom (do all they can) it is impossible to vanquish; that they had but few among them, who were able to defend themselves; and how Brave and Resolute soe∣ver they might be, it was evident, they could not long resist two powerful Armies, and so many Troops as were ready to attack them on all sides. To think the State of Publick Affairs would change, was to flatter themselves with vain imaginations: That Men ought to take their Mea∣sures according to the present state of things, and that which appa∣rently was like to come to pass: That common Sense and Prudence, would never build important Re∣solutions, upon Miraculous Events: That all Europe enjoy'd perfect Peace, and France was dreaded by all the world, and had therefore
no Reason to fear its being at∣tacqu'd by any Prince, or that any thing could happen to occasion the recalling of those Troops which were in Piedmont, to em∣ploy them in any other place; that they ought not to depend on the Succours they expected, and tho' they that were promis'd should be sent, yet against every single man that should come, their Enemies could oppose whole Companies. That they could not long subsist for want of Victuals, and that tho' their Sallies should be successful (which was not like∣ly) all the Provisions which they would that way be able to get, could not suffice to maintain so great a number of people; in sine, they made it appear, that Resi∣stance would infallibly be their total ruine, and that then those Ancient Churches would be de∣stroy'd, which had subsisted with so much Glory, in the midst of
so many Persecutions. And that it was much better, by a prudent retreat, to remove the Sacred Candlestick to some other place, than to put out the light by rash Resolutions. It was said, that such as were of ability might contribute some∣what to those that were poor, to help them in their Voyage; and their not being able to sell all their goods, was not such a con∣sideration as ought to stay them; because life ought to be dearer to 'em than their Lands, and that it was much better, to lose part of a man's goods, than to de∣stroy himself. The Ministers and Deputies seeing they could not agree, and that the point in question could not be otherwise decided, than by their Communities, told the Em∣bassadors, that the business in de∣bate being of the highest conse∣quence, they could not positively
resolve upon any thing, without having first assembled their Com∣munities, to know what they would do in this occasion, and therefore promis'd to bring their last resolu∣tion to Turin, provided they might have a Pass-port for their safety. The Embassadors being return'd to Turin, informed the Marquess St. Thomas, that the people of the Vallies, thought it better to die upon the Graves of their Ance∣stors, than to lose their Spiritual Liberty, in submitting to his R. H. Edict; beseeching his High∣ness, with all due Respect, that he would in some measure moderate the rigour of it; and that if his R. H. would not mitigate the Se∣verity thereof, in favour of his miserable Subjects, things must apparently come to dreadful Ex∣tremities, and that the rigour he used in this occasion, must cause the ruine of a great part of his people. The Embassadors further
said, that hoping his R. H. would for their Masters sake, moderate those orders he had given against his Subjects of the Vallies, they had taken the Liberty to make some Proposals, which might prevent all the mischiefs the ri∣gorous Execution of the Edict was like to produce; and that they might know the intention of those people, they pray'd the Marquess to obtain a safe Conduct for such Deputies as should be sent from the Vallies. But the Marquess St. Thomas told the Ambassadours, That his Royal Highness, for very good rea∣sons, would not give the Deputies of the Vallies a safe Conduct; and that the Secretary to their Embassie might be sent to bring back those Peoples Reasons. The Secretary was then sent to the Vaudois with this follow∣ing Letter.
WE doubt not but that your Deputies have faithfully reported to you our Opinions, which we believe have no other foundation but the Publick good of your Com∣munities, and since our return to Turin, we have learnt many things which confirm us in our fears for you, we have given you good advice, and we hope you will follow the Coun∣sel we gave your Deputies, being per∣swaded that God by his Divine Pro∣vidence, will conduct you to some retreat, where you may have all that is necessary for Life, and also Li∣berty to serve him in his fear, ac∣cording to the dictates of your Con∣science; and seeing you know the Con∣dition of your Affairs require a speedy remedy, and that no time be lest for the obtaining of it from your Prince, we have thought it abso∣lutely necessary, immediately to di∣spatch our Secretary, to let you know, that his R. H. will not grant any
Passports to your Deputies, and therefore we pray you to send us speedily your resolution in writing, fearing that if you delay to inform us, our endeavours for you will be no longer acceptable at Court, and so we shall become useless, and unable to procure free leave for you to depart; which to obtain, we will, if you please, apply our selves to his R. H. with all possible care and affection, &c. The Communities being as∣sembled, the Secretary deliver'd to 'em the Ambassador's Letter, which when read, he told 'em, their Af∣fairs grew daily worse and worse; and that the French Ambassadour continually press'd his Royal High∣ness to have the Edict executed; that his Royal Highness on his part was very impatient it was not done, because his Reputation was engaged, or because he was at very great charge to maintain
the Troops that were in his Coun∣try; that seeing it was impossible to obtain a revocation of the Edict, they ought to think of the best means to mollifie his Highness, and procure such a mitigation of it as might yet be demanded: Lastly, he pray'd them to reflect on all those Considerations, which had been alledged by the Embassa∣dors, and to give him their answer in writing. After this Representation, the Ministers and other Deputies having consulted together, agreed to answer the Embassadors in this following manner. My Lords, WE have received the Let∣ter which your Excellen∣cies has been pleas'd to send us, by Monsieur—Secretary to your Embassy, and having heard from him an exact relation of the extra∣ordinary pains your Excellencies
have taken, to represent to his R. H. our Prince, and the Lords his Ministers, all those Reasons which might best serve to maintain our Right, and the answers by you given to those reproaches, where∣with our Conduct in general, and some particular actions have been charged, we with grateful hearts render to your Excellencies our most humble thanks. We have made all possible re∣flections on the Subject of your Let∣ter, and which way soever we turn our eyes, we meet with such difficul∣ties as are impossible to be overcome, and which we have taken the Li∣berty to put into the Memoirs hereto annexed, on which we pray your Excellencies to cast your Eyes, and make such Observations on them as your great Prudence shall suggest; we are verily perswaded, your Ex∣cellencies have no other end than to offer those Expedients, which may be safest for these poor Churches,
who most humbly beseech you, if it be impossible to procure a Revocati∣on of the Order that hath been pub∣lished, or to obtain any equitable Moderation of its Rigour, that you will then have the Charity to think of some other Expedients, which you shall judge more proper for our pre∣servation; when you have taken no∣tice of the difficulties which in the Memoirs we have represented to you, we leave our selves wholly to your prudent Conduct. This, my Lords, is the Opinion of the Church∣es in general, who will never cease to send up Prayers to the Divine Majesty, for the prosperity of your Excellencies Sacred Persons, and the happy success of your Embassy, which is the wish, My Lords, Of your most Humble, most Obedient, and most obliged Servants, the Pastors and Deputies of the Protestant Churches in Piedmont.

Jean Baptist Roberto. Estienne Gnatier. Paul Beux. Jean Pierre Guantan. Daniel Alberon. From Angrogn, March 28, 1686. In their Memoir, in the first place, they obesrv'd, That none but the rich Families could go out of the Country; and that others, how willing soever they might be to depart, that they were not able to do it, by reason of their Po∣verty; and if they stay'd in the
Country, they would certainly be forced to change their Religion. Secondly, It might happen, That when the chiefest Families were gone out of the Country, the rest might be stopt upon one pretence or other, notwithstanding they have been promised Liberty to do what they pleased; That if their Patents, granted them by the in∣terposition of many Soveraign Prin∣ces, were revoked, there would be no scruple made of breaking the Promise past to the Embassa∣dors. Thirdly, That the sale of their Goods might be secretly opposed, by forbidding the Roman-Catho∣licks to buy them; or at least, they should be able to sell only their Lands which they had in the Champain Country, and not those which were in the Mountains and barren places. In the fourth place, They pray'd the Embassadors, to desire, that
those Debts might be paid which were legally due to them, and which they could not get in be∣fore their departure; that his R. H. would likewise be pleas'd, to ob∣tain from the King of France, li∣berty to sell the Estates which they had in the Vallies of Perouse, and to look after the payment of what was due to them from the Inhabitants of that Country. Fifthly, They did humbly pray, that sufficient time might be given them for selling their Goods, and to find out a place of retreat; and that in the mean while, the Exe∣cution of the Edict might cease, and their Ministers continue their Exercises as formerly. Lastly, They propos'd to the Embassadors, the difficulty of finding Waggons to carry away their Families, and their Baggage, they being no less than 15000 persons. This Writing being deliver'd to
the Embassadours, with the Let∣ter sent from the Inhabitants of the Vallies; they made a Visit to the Marquess St. Thomas, and ha∣ving told him, that they hop'd to persuade the Vaudois to leave their Country, provided they might do it in a safe and advantage∣ous manner; they desir'd him to ask his R. H. whether he would permit his poor Subjects to quit his Dominions; and in case he found him so dispos'd, then to ask him, whether he would be pleas'd to name some persons of his Coun∣cil, with whom the Embassadors might treat of Conditions for their departure, and remove all ob∣stacles which might stand in their way. While they were waiting for his R. H's. answer, the Embassadours warmly sollicited the Ministers of State, to persuade his Highness to grant that which they now desir'd, but their endeavours had not that
success they expected; for his R. H. commanded Count Marsenas to tell them, he was inform'd by his Mi∣nisters, that they were very solli∣citous to obtain free leave for his Subjects to go out of the Vallies, and to adjust with some of his Ministers, terms for their depar∣ture, but he had commanded them to declare, that this people had been so audacious, as to take up Arms against him, even in a time when he had no Troops near their Country, that they had commit∣ted a thousand insolencies, and braved him with such boldness, as deserved severe punishment: They therefore were unworthy of that favour, the Embassadors desired for them; and so much the more unworthy, because before their arrival at Court, these people had with great submission, presented several Petitions, to obtain some moderation in the Execution of the Edict; but now pretended with
Swords in their hands to force him to revoke it; nevertheless he assur'd the Embassadors, that if these Rebels would shew their Repentance for what had past, and submit themselves with that respect which was due to him, he was inclin'd to be merciful to them, and to let them see how much he regarded the Cantons mediation. The Embassadors sur∣prised with this new Proposition, told Count Marsenas, that they did not see how his R. H. could require from his Subjects such a submission; for should his Peo∣ple own that they had been un∣dutiful to their Prince, they would render themselves guilty by their own confession, and therefore they ought not to be obliged to make any declaration of this na∣ture; and should any go about to bring them to such a resolution, it would be impossible to prevail with them, because they would
never blacken themselves with a crime, of which they knew them∣selves innocent, and give just occasion to have their Goods confiscated, that they would have just reason to suspect any man that should propose such a thing to them, and that from such an Overture, nothing could be ex∣pected but prolonging their Nego∣tiation, and rendring it ineffectual. But when Count Marsenas told them, his R. H. was positively resolved, that the Vaudois Sub∣mission should precede the favour he intended to shew them, the Embassadors thought fit to have recourse to the Marquess St. Tho∣mas, desiring him to soften a lit∣tle his R. H. When they came to the Marquess they prayed him to represent to his Highness, that in obliging his Subjects to confess they were guilty of Rebellion, he required that of them, to which they could never yield.
That such a Declaration would cover them with eternal shame, and that they could not in consci∣ence confess crimes, of which they were not guilty. That now it ap∣pear'd his R.H. made little account of the mediation and intercession of their Soveraign Lords, in resolving that the favours which they desi∣red, should depend upon a condi∣tion, to which his Subjects could never submit. The Marquess St. Thomas gave them the same answer they had from Count Marsenas, which was▪ That the Prince was inflexible in this point, that it was impossible to alter his mind by any Rea∣sons that could be urged, and that it would be in vain, to try to make him change his resolution. This Answer from the Marquess, very much troubled the Embassa∣dors, who begun to fear, that some snares were laying for the poor Vaudois, and that there was
a design to condemn them, by the Confession they themselves should make of their Rebellion: Never∣theless, they resolv'd this difficulty should not make them break off the Treaty they had begun; they consider'd, that his Highness might tell the World, his Subjects had re∣fus'd to accept the Favours he had offered them; besides, they thought the ill success of this Negotiation, might be imputed to them; but the Reason which most prevail'd with them, was, that they plainly saw, it would be more for the advan∣tage of the Vaudois, to submit to the Will of their Soveraign, than to expose themselves to all the mischiefs their Disobedience might bring upon them. They therefore determin'd to consent to the accommodation pro∣pounded to them, as a less Evil, than to see the Vally Churches brought to Desolation: and the rather, because the Marquess
St. Thomas assur'd them, that his R. H. to testifie the esteem he had for them, would at their interces∣sion grant all that could be rea∣sonably desired, without wounding his reputation. But before the Embassadors would propose to the Vaudois, that which their Prince required of them, the Embassadors desired not only to be inform'd, of what nature the submission was to be, which was expected from them; but also to regulate and agree with his R. H. Ministers, in what form and term it should be drawn up. Several Projects of the Peti∣tion to be presented to his R. H. by the Vaudois, were by each party proposed; but at last it was agreed, it should contain a most humble supplication, beseeching the Prince to pardon those offen∣ces which they might have com∣mitted; and if they had not paid
that respect which was due to him, yet they had never fail'd in the Allegiance they had sworn to his Highness. After which the Embassadors having got a safe conduct for five or six of the Inhabitants of the Vallies, they sent it away to them by the Secretary of the Embassie, with a Letter whereof you have here a Copy. Sirs, ACcording to your desire signi∣fied to us, in your Letter of the 28th of the Month of March, and the Memoir thereto annexed: We have requested his Royal High∣ness, that he would be pleas'd to grant you leave to depart out of his Dominions, and to dispose of all your Goods; that he would likewise be pleas'd to appoint Commissioners, who with us, might regulate the manner of your departure: Here∣vpon his Royal Highness hath by one
of his Ministers signified to us, That he being your Soveraign, he could not without a breach of his Ho∣nour and Authority, enter into any Treaty with you; but will have you depute five or six Persons, with full Power to make the submission which is due to him; and to petition for the favour you desire should be granted to you; and then his High∣ness will testifie what esteem he hath for our Lords. We did in∣deed expect a more favourable an∣swer than this: but however, to take away all pretences from his R. H. of resolving to do that which may be fatal to you, we think you will do well, to send Deputies as soon as possible, promising that we will assist them with our best coun∣sel, in delivering their Petition and Supplication. Our Secretary, who who will deliver this to you, with the safe conduct which we send, will tell you more at large, the parti∣culars of our Negotiation, and how
the Court stands affected toward you. The Secretary of the Embassie, having delivered this Letter to the Deputies of the Vallies, whom he caused to assemble; and ha∣ving given them an exact account of the Embassadors Negotiation with his Royal Highness, and what effect it had produced; en∣tered into a long discourse to exhort them to submit to their Prince's will, and prayed that he might be speedily dispatched, as∣suring them, that upon the Am∣bassadors account, they would obtain much more favour than they imagined. Those of the Assembly who had most sence and reason, espe∣cially the Ministers, did all they could to perswade the rest to submit to the Law impos'd upon them; since in the extremity whereto they were reduced, they
must either perish with their mi∣serable Families, or accept that which was offer'd. But all the reasons which could be urged, were not able to pre∣vail with them, so that after ha∣ving debated the question almost a whole day, they separated without being able to agree in one opinion. Those of the Valley of St, Mar∣tin, of Perouse, of St. Bartholo∣mew, of Parastin, of Rocheplatte, of Villard, of Roras, and one part of de la Tour, were willing to make the submissions required of them, and having deputed for that purpose, six Persons who had or∣der to go to the Court of Turin; they gave them Procurations in due form, whereby they promi∣sed to do all that they thought fit in the Negotiation which they had undertaken, for the Interest of the Valley Churches: But those of Boby, of St. John, and part of
those of Angrogne, flattering them∣selves with the hope of imaginary Succours, resolved with Swords in their hands to defend the exer∣cise of their Religion, and sent to the Ambassadors, their Deputy named Bianchis, who delivered to them the following Letter. Most High, Mighty, and So∣veraign Lords. PƲrsuant to the Letter which your Excellencies have been pleased to write to the Vallies some days ago, our Churches of St. John, Angrogne, and Boby, throw themselves at your feet, to assure you of their most humble respects, and of the due sence they have of all those favours, which your Ex∣cellencies endeavour to obtain and procure for them, from his Royal Highness our Soveraign, for the continuance of the exercise of our
Religion in these places: and as for the proposition now in question, seeing our People cannot agree in the same opinion with other Churches: We cannot send to your Excellencies the consent we desire, and therefore have charged the Sieur Daniel Bianchis Syndich of the Community of St. John, to tell you by word of mouth our thoughts, and most humbly to beseech you, that you will be pleased to conti∣nue to us, the effects of your Ex∣traordinary and Paternal Charity, especially by your powerful Interces∣sions with his Royal Highness, for the above-mention'd Exercise of our Religion, earnestly praying that the Lord will bless your Negotiation, and bountifully reward all your care, pains, and travels, which your Excellencies have had the goodness to take for our poor Flocks, in whose names, with all imaginable respect and due submission, we are
proud to bear the Title of your Excellencies Most Humble, most Obedient, and most Obliged Servants, the Deputies of the Churches. Deputies of the Church of St. John. Michel Purise Jean Muston, Jean, Putta for Angrogne. Of the Church of Bo∣y. Marque de Daniel, Negrin N. Sindic, Francis Dane, Counsellor, Stephan Pertin, Deputy, The Sieur de la Bastie Minister of St. John, troubled at the divi∣sion of these unfortunate Churches, wrote to the Embassadors in the following Terms.
My Lords, I Take the liberty to present my most humble duty to your Ex∣cellencies, by the Deputies who are going to Turin, to make the submis∣sion to his Royal Highness, and to present to him the Petition which your Excellencies have thought fit. I am with my Collegues in very great consternation and affliction, to see our People so much divided about our leaving the Country, fear∣ing that this will prejudice your Ex∣cellencies Negotiation with his Roy∣al Highness in our favour, and render your pains unsuccessful: We have not fail'd to do all we could to make them understand, that in this present juncture of time, it was the safest course could be taken; but we have not been happy enough to succeed and satisfie all; if we did not know your Excellencies un∣parrallel'd Charity, we should have cause to fear this indiscreet conduct, might lessen your Friendship and
Zeal for our good. We most hum∣bly beseech your Excellencies to shew in this occasion, so much goodness and clemency, as not to slacken the indefatigable pains you take, and I humbly beg your Excellencies Par∣don for the Liberty I take, and with all reverence, respect, and submis∣sion, I assure your Lordships, that I am, your Excellencies Most Humble, most Obedient, and most Obliged Servant, Sydrac Bastie, Minister at Angrogne. April the 4th. 1686. This diversity of Opinions made the Embassadors fear, that the Enemies of their Religion taking advantage of the Vaudois Division, would prevail with his Highness, to destroy the innocent with the guilty, and to suffer none at all to go out of the Country.
They therefore sent back to the Vallies, the Deputy of Boby, with a Letter which they wrote to those that resolved to take Arms, conjuring him to use all his Power, to make them agree in opinion with the other Church∣es. The Letter was penn'd in this manner. Sirs, IT is true, that a Man's own Coun∣try hath very great Charms, and the greatest part of Mankind have a natural desire to live and dye in it, but yet the Children of God, ought not to set their Hearts upon it, seeing they are strangers upon Earth, Heaven being their proper Country; so that you will be guilty of distrusting Divine Providence, if you fear you shall not be able to find another Country, where you may con∣veniently live and adore your Hea∣venly Father. In what part of the World soever a Man is, he ought
to think himself happy, if he there have liberty to serve God according to the Dictates of his own Consci∣ence. You ought to follow the Exam∣ple of the Patriarchs, who drew down God's Blessing on themselves, by relying on his Promises, and by abandoning their Houses and Lands, when he commanded them to go and dwell in a strange Country. The like Confidence cannot but be accep∣table to God, and it is without doubt, more conformable to the mind of the Gospel; to forsake a Man's Country, than to take Arms against his Soveraign. Christians are called to suffer, and not to resist, and we do not find that the Apostles or the Primitive Church, made use of any other defence, but Prayers and Pa∣tience, against their Persecutors. These are the Considerations which obliged our Soveraign Lords the Evangelick Cantons to give us or∣der; to procure from his Royal Highness, your lawful Prince, free
leave for you to depart, with per∣mission to dispose of your Goods, in case he will not any longer suffer the Exercise of your Religion: And tho' you look on this retreat as an intollerable Mischief, yet our Sove∣raign Lords consider it as a favour, when they reflect on the sad Condi∣tion whereto you are reduced; they also think it will be very diffi∣cult to obtain it from his Royal Highness: If he grant it at their intercession: You ought not only to accept it with submission, but also to be very thankful for it. After this, you cannot doubt but that we have been very much surprised to hear, that you have resolved not to take this Course, but intend to resist two mighty Potentates; who have oblig'd themselves to extirpate you, in case you do not submit to their will: And herein you do not only act against your Duty, against Christian Prudence, and against your own Interest; but you give us
just cause to complain of you, seeing that after having engaged us in a Negotiation with your Prince, you will not so much as stoop to lay hold on those advantages we are able to procure for you. Open your Eyes then, and see the mischief into which you are running headlong, and the fatal consequences of your resolution, which must necessarily ruine your Churches, and destroy your Families; know that what is offered you, is so much for your advantage, considering the present state of your affairs, that many persons of the best quality, would have embraced it as a great bles∣sing, in the late Persecutions in France, yea would have been glad with all their Hearts, if they might have been suffered to quit their Country Stark-naked. If you will consider all these things, we hope their Example, whose Resoluti∣ons are more reasonable, will move you, and perswade you to be of their
opinion; if you refuse to follow their Example, and persist in your obsti∣nacy, you will be guilty before God, not only of throwing away your lives, which you might have saved, and of exposing your Wives and Chil∣dren to butchery, but also of having caused the ruine of the rest of the Valley Churches, which you might have removed into another Country. Flatter not your selves with be∣lieving you shall be able to escape these Mischiefs, by the succours which some have told you you shall receive, for we assure you that they who entertain you with such vain ima∣ginations, abuse you; there is not any place that will or can assist you, you will be forsaken by all people, even by one part of the Inhabitants of your Country, so that you will soon be destroyed either by Famine or the Sword; they that escape the fury of their Enemies, must expect to dye at a Stake, on the Wheel, or the Gallows: We therefore con∣jure
you, to let such considerations as these prevail with you, and a∣gree with those Communities, that have resolved to desire their Prince's leave to retire out of his Domini∣ons; believing that Gods Providence will lead you into some place, where you may find perhaps a better and more advantageous settlement, than that which you leave, and where the poor will meet with charitable Persons who will provide for their necessities. Hoping that God will in∣spire you with prudent resolutions, and that you will give to your De∣puties, such Procurations as other Communities have given theirs; we recommend you to his Mercy, and to his divine Protection, remain∣ing, Sirs, Your very affectionate to serve, &c. Turin, April 5th. While the Embassadors were expecting the return of this De∣puty,
they thought it necessary to let the Marquess St. Thomas know in what disposition the Vaudois were, and prevent those Evils which their Division might draw upon them from His Royal Highness, and the Enemies which they had in his Council. They therefore went to give this Mi∣nister a Visit, and told him, the Deputies were come, that five of them were ready in the name of their Communities to make their submission, which His Royal High∣ness required of them: But others who did not know what they were to expect from His High∣nesses Clemency, were not yet re∣solved to Sign the Submission. In the mean time a Letter was writ∣ten to them, to advise them to follow their Example, who had resolved to submit, and that their Resolution would be very spedily known. After this, they pray'd the
Marquess to intercede with His Royal Highness to favour those poor People, and beseech him to have some pity on them; That His Highness seeing they were prepossess'd with distrust, would so far declare his Intentions, as to put them out of pain, and that the submission might be made by common consent, to the satisfaction both of Prince, and People. The Marquess St. Thomas told the Embassadors, that the obsti∣nacy of the Vaudois did very much surprize him; nevertheless, he promis'd to do for them all the good Offices he could with His Royal Highness, that so their delaying to give His Highness the satisfaction He expected, might not be prejudicial to them, and that His Highness might not fol∣low the Counsel of other Persons, who press'd him to use severity. The Court was very impatient to see an end of this Affair, the
Embassadors wrote a Letter to the Marquess St. Thomas, to let him know they had prepared the Vau∣dois Petition, and that it should be ready to be presented, when it was Signed by all the Deputies; but one of them being absent, they pray'd nothing might be done 'till his return. The next day after this Letter was deliver'd to the Marquess St. Thomas, the Embassadors waited on him, to learn what effect it had wrought, when he prest very much that the five Deputies who were then at Turin, should Sign the Petition, whereof he liked the form: The Embassadors told him, that the Subscription could not be made by the Deputies who were present, in his absence who was sent to the Vallies; for their Interests being joint, they could not separate one from another, and that it had been agreed, the Pe∣tition should be Sign'd at one and
the same time by all the De∣puties. But the Marquess St. Thomas having secret Orders to hasten the Subscription of the Deputies who were at Court, was not satisfied with the Reasons given for re∣fusing what he demanded; and the next day he sent one of his People to the Ambassadors, to de∣sire they would dispose the De∣puties to give him the satisfaction he desired; but the Embassadors wrote a few Lines to the Marquess, wherein they said it was not just to divide those in the Subscription, who were engaged in the same Cause; and that if some Signed the Petition without the others, such a Proceeding must needs have ill Consequences, and therefore intreated the Marquess to stay but one day more for the sixth De∣puty, and prevail with his Royal Highness to grant them the short stay they desired.
The Marquess having received this Note, told the Secretary of the Embassy who brought it, that his Royal Highness was extreamly displeas'd with these delays, and likewise said he very much fear'd his Highness would take such a Resolution, as would carry things to fatal extremities; the Deputies must therefore Sign their Petition immediately, and bring it to him, that he might present it to his Royal Highness. The Deputies fearing to irritate so powerful a Minister, if they refus'd to appear before him, re∣solved to go to his House; but all the Arguments the Marquess us'd, could not perswade them to Sign the Petition, tho' he assur'd them it should be no prejudice to those of Boby: But they stood firm to their first Resolution; their excuse was, that they were oblig'd to stay for the Deputy who was gone to the Vallies, That the success
of his Negotiation was uncertain, That he was to return speedily, and that Signing separately, might involve them in a great deal of danger. The Resolution of these De∣puties at Turin, and that of the Vaudois who intended to take Arms, very much disquieted his Royal Highness; and that which more displeas'd him, was the news brought him, that they had kill'd two French Men, who belong'd to the Cittadel of Pignerol. The Embassador of France who was extreamly impatient, because his Royal Highness delay'd the execution of his Edict, fail'd not to take advantage of this accident, and by it to dispose his Highness to take vengeance on his Subjects, who had committed this Crime in contempt of his Authority, and to deal with these People like Rebels. While the Enemies of the Vaudois were contriving their
destruction, the Deputies at Turin were in a sad Condition; and not knowing what to resolve, they took Counsel of the Embassadors, to know what course they should take in this their present extremi∣ties: the Embassadors hoping that the Deputy who was gone to Boby, would speedily return, and that he might bring back News which might appease his Royal Highness, thought it best to stay for his coming, before they took any particular Resolution. But the Deputy staying a long time, and his Royal Highness being continually sollicited by the French Embassador, to put an end to this Affair, otherwise the Troops which were in his Country would put him to excessive Charge; his Highness, being likewise inform'd, that the Embassadors had dispatch'd a Courrier into Switzerland, who might bring them new Orders, resolved, for these Reasons, to put
an end to the business, and not∣withstanding all the earnest and pressing Reasons, which the Em∣bassadors urged in favour of the Vaudois, to incline the Duke to defer for some little time his last Resolution, he caused the follow∣ing Edict to be Published the 9th Day of June. DIvine Providence in setting up Soveraigns over the People, gave to Princes the Power of di∣stributing Rewards and Punishments, that the hope of Reward might en∣courage the good to do their duty, and the fear of Punishment, might deter the wicked from doing evil; tho' our Subjects of the Vallies of Lucerne, who make profession of the pretended Reformed Religion, de∣serve to be chastised by the hand of Vengeance, because they have not only with great obstinacy disobey'd Our Edict of the 31th of January, but have harden'd themselves in
their wickedness, and are fallen into notorious and horrible Rebellion; yet our natural Clemency surpassing their Crimes, We with fatherly for∣bearance have a long time in vain expected their Repentance, and tho' they have hitherto follow'd ill Coun∣sel, We are still willing to leave them to their own Resolutions, either to chuse a good or bad Condition: We open to them a door of Grace▪ that they may make advantage of it, in the manner following; where∣with if they do not comply, by their ready obedience, let them thank their own temerity for the Punish∣ment they have deserved, and shall receive without remission, from Our injur'd Patience. First, therefore We confirm Our Order of the 31th of January, in all things, wherein it is not contrary to this; and We, by Vertue of this present Edict, do of our own cer∣tain Knowledge, full Power, and absolute Authority, by the Advice
of Our Council, Order, and Command all Our Subjects of the Vallies of Lu∣cerne, professing the pretended Refor∣med Religion, to lay down their Arms, and retire to their Houses, within the time hereafter limited. We also command them not to have any Meetings or Assemblies in any manner whatever, that accord∣ing to Our intention, the Judges of the places may have free access thi∣ther, and that the Fathers Missionary, and other Religions may return to the Churches they were forced to leave, and that the Catholicks, and those that have embraced the Ca∣tholick Religion, may return unto the Houses which they quitted. And seeing it is not reasonable that the Missionary Religious, the Catholicks, and such as have em∣braced the Catholick Religion, should be at any loss for the many damages they have suffered from those of the pretended Reformed Religion, We Intend, Will, and Ordain, that
there be Levied indistinctly and ge∣nerally, upon the Goods of those of the pretended Reformed Religion, all such necessary Sums to indemnify them, as shall be summarily proved before the Chevalier Monroux, Chief Justice of the Vallies; Declaring nevertheless, that in case those of the said Religion, do prove parti∣cular Persons were the cause of those damages, then satisfaction shall be required of those particular Per∣sons. And to shew Our said Subjects how great Our Clemency is, towards them, we permit all who resolve to depart out of Our Dominions, to do it within the term, and upon the Conditions hereafter prescribed. But because their evil intentions have been too well known by their past Behaviour, and many may hide their wicked Designs under the Cloak of Obedience, We reserve to Our selves Power of making such Laws concerning those who shall not
voluntarily quit Our Dominions, as We think good and most expedient, to secure the peace of those that stay; which Laws we expect shall be observed by them for the fu∣ture. And for an addition to Our Grace and Favour, We grant, as well to those that shall depart vo∣luntarily, as to those that shall re∣tire by Our Command, leave to carry with them what Necessaries, Goods and Effects they please, and to sell such Goods and Effects as they leave behind them, but in the manner hereafter exprest. The same is intended concerning Foreigners, and those that are descended from them, who are to conform themselves to the last Ar∣ticle of the above-mentioned Order, Dated January the 31th. The Sale of Goods aforesaid shall be made to Catholicks, and to Per∣sons that have embraced the Ca∣tholick Religion; but because such
buyers may not be found within the term hereafter exprest, and because it is not our Will, that the Reli∣gionists who shall depart out of Our Dominions, should be deprived of the benefit of our present Concessi∣ons; We grant them power to ap∣point four or six Persons, with whom they may leave their Procu∣rations, and who shall with our permission stay three Months in Lu∣cerne, with free liberty to treat and negotiate with any Person for the selling the Goods of those that are gone, who likewise may specifie in their Procurations, upon what terms they would (for their greater Security) have their Goods sold, and receive their price from their Proctors, without Fraud or Im∣bezelment, whereever they desire to have it remitted, whereof the Chief Justice Monroux shall be charged to take care. They that will retire shall be ob∣liged to be ready at such days and
places as are hereafter specified, and to depart without Fire Arms, by ways appointed, either through Sa∣voy, or the Valley of Aoste; to this purpose they shall have Pass-Ports from us, that they may re∣ceive no ill usage or hindrance in our Dominions, but on the contra∣ry, that all aid and assistance may be given to them; and because their number being great, they may be expos'd to inconveniencies in their passage, and the places thro' which they pass overcharged, they shall be divided into three Brigades or Com∣panies, the first to be compos'd of those of the Valley of Lucerne, who are to be ready at La Tour this Month of April: the second Com∣pany compos'd of those of the Valley of Angrogne, St. Bartholomew, Roche Platte, and are to be ready at St. Second, and part the day following, viz. the 22th of this Month; the third and last Brigade made up of those of the Valley of
St. Martin and Perouse are Com∣manded to be at Miradol, and part the 23d of this Month. The term within which our Subjects of the pretended Refor∣med Religion, Inhabiting the Vallies of Lucerne, are to lay down their Arms in the manner exprest in the first Article of the present Order, is eight days af∣ter it shall be Publish'd in Lucerne, within which time they are to obey the Contents of the Order, if they expect to enjoy the fruits of Our Clemency, and of that Paternal affection, wherewith, notwithstanding the greatness of their Crimes, We regard Our Subjects, and We grant to all Our said Subjects, who punctually observe all that is above men∣tioned, Grace, Pardon, Remis∣sion, Abolition, and an ample Amnesty of all their Transgres∣sions, Faults, Crimes, and other Offences they may have done or
committed, since the publication of Our Order of the 31th of Ja∣nuary last, as well in general, as in particular, so that they shall never be prosecuted for them upon any pretence whatever. And we forbid all Judges, Fis∣cals, and others to whom it may belong, any way to prosecute or molest them; but if they shall render themselves unworthy of Our Grace, by not observing all that We have above commanded, within the term prefixt, it will be of very pernicious Example any longer to delay the punish∣ment they have deserved, after having thrown away Our favours upon them, and so long waited for their repentance▪ We will then make use of those means which God hath put into Our hands, to reduce the obstinate to their duty, and punish them for their intolerable insolence sent to Our Senate, &c. Given
at Turin the 9th of April, 1686. Ratify'd the 10th. As soon as this Edict was Print∣ed, the Marquess St. Thomas brought it to the Embassadors, whom he would have made believe, that it was for their sake his Royal High∣ness had been so gracious to his Subjects, and that tho' the French Embassador was extreamly angry so much favour was shew'd to the Inhabitants of the Vallies, yet His Royal Highness intended the Edict should be bona fide executed. The Embassadors having read the Edict upon the place, in the presence of the Marquess, made some Reflections on it, they in∣sisted chiefly on the shortness of the time given to these miserable people to depart out of his High∣nesses Dominions, and to dispose of their Effects; they likewise took notice of the small number of Proctors who were charged to sell the goods of so great a number of
Persons; they reflected on the time prescribed for sale, and some other difficulties they met with in the execution of the Edict, which when they had well consider'd, they intended to lay before his Royal Highness. As soon as the Embassadors had left the Marquess, they sent for the Deputies of the Vallies who were ready to make the submission, and bid them return home, char∣ging them to inform their Com∣munities of all that had past, and what was contain'd in the Edict, and to let them know, that if they did not submit, it would be im∣possible to procure the rigorous execution of the Edict to be in any particular mitigated. While these things were doing, the sixth Deputy who had been so long expected, came back from the Vallies, and told the Embas∣sadors, that the Communities who design'd to defend themselves, per∣sisted
in that resolution, and that all the arguments which had been us'd to incline them to bet∣ter thoughts, wrought no change in their minds, as appear'd by the Letters written from the Vallies, which were to the following effect. My Lords, PResently after the arrival of of our Deputy, we did not fail to give Copies of the Letter which your Excellencies were pleased to write to our Churches, they have been every where read, immediately after Sermon; nothing can be written more true, more moving, or more con∣solatory; and your Excellencies may be perfectly assur'd, that there is not a person who doth not see and acknowledge the Ef∣fects of your Christian Charity towards our Churches; however,
it hath been hitherto impossible to perswade the greatest part of the People to go out of this Coun∣trey; some out of an apprehen∣sion, that it will be the loss of many who stay; some out of a Principle of Conscience; and o∣thers for divers Considerations, which our Deputy will tell your Excellencies by word of mouth. We are at our wits end about it, and scarce dare to appear be∣fore your Excellencies after so much irresolution; our People are the more obstinate in their opinion, since they have heard that several other Churches, or at least a good part of them, never understood that any such thing as going out of the Country was in question, when they gave their Mandate and Procuration to their Deputies; or if they have heard of it, they are return'd to their first Resolution; which makes us justly fear, that when
your Excellencies shall be further engaged for these People, they will hereafter repent their refu∣sing to depart, which we like∣wise thought the Sunday morning, when we told your Excellencies that we desir'd to have the opi∣nion of our People upon this point; foreseeing at first that it would be very difficult to make them consent to it; the greatest part of them are resolved to be their Fathers own Children, and hope the Lord will be their De∣liverer, and serve himself of the weak, to confound the strong, and that Heaven by some means or other will prevent the designs which are laid against them. We doubt not but this will very much trouble your Excellencies, and we are sorry for it with all our Souls; nevertheless, we with all possible humility, conjure your Excellen∣cies not to wax cold towards our Churches, nor to deprive us of
your powerful assistance and sup∣port, which under God, hath hi∣therto made us subsist; for Gods sake have still pity upon us, which way soever things go; we pour out our Souls before God, ear∣nestly beseeching him, that he will be pleased to dispose all things to the glory of his Name, and for the preservation of our People; and that his Divine Providence will wake your Excellencies In∣strumental to procure some few days longer for us, once more to try the Peoples minds, and if it be possible to know their final resolution by majority of voices, that so we may not be blamed by either side; the Lord will abun∣dantly reward all your Excellen∣cies Charity, and we are with all respect, Your Lordships Most Humble, and Most Obliged Servants, the De∣puties of Boby, St. John, and Angrogne.
Deputies of Boby. Jean Aghitto, Daniel Grass, Estienne Danno, Deputies of St. John. Michael Parisa, Jean Muschom, Deputies of An∣grogne. Jean Duffa, Pierre Duffa, and Louis Odin, Angrogne, the 9th of April, 1686. Most High, Mighty, and So∣veraign Lords, WE, with all humility, cast our selves at your Ex∣cellencies feet, to testify how ex∣treamly sorry we are to see that a great part of our People have not sense enough to consider with Christian prudence the favour which your Excellencies endea∣vour
to obtain for us, by procu∣ring free leave for our going out of this Countrey with body and goods, and will not with holy joy embrace it, as a Present from Heaven, and a Favour for which they will another time sigh in vain; this makes our hearts bleed, and the more, because the Letter which your Excellencies were pleased to write to them, should immediately have obliged to a resolution, in a business of this nature; we presume neverthe∣less, most humbly to beseech your Excellencies to be so good, as to pass by these Considerations, knowing that when men have to do with a multitude, 'tis very difficult to bring them to any conclusion, and without a great deal of time spent, to make them understand the reason and state of things, especially when the business in question is, forsaking a Native Countrey, of which the
possession hath been so long and so carefully kept; yet there is a great number even of the best Quality, who entirely resign them∣selves to your Excellencies Coun∣cil, Charity, and Prudence, and will never refuse to do that which they think most expedient for the glory of God, and for their own safety, and preservation: the Pastors also are all of this O∣pinion, and we will punctually follow the Counsel which your Excellencies shall please to give us; and we most humbly be∣seech you to have pity on us, and our Families, to deliver us from a mischief which in appear∣ance is inevitable; this is the fa∣vour which we promise our selves from your Excellencies, upon whom we pray that the Lord will power down his most precious blessings; we are with all pos∣sible submission and respect, Most High, Mighty and Soveraign Lords,
Your Excellencies must Humble and most Obedient Servants, Sidrac Bastie. Guillaume Malanot. From Angrogne, the 9th of April, 1686. It hath been certify'd from a good hand, that certainly his Royal High∣ness will not suffer the carrying a∣way of our goods, but that he will detain them, to defray the charge he hath already been at. Secondly, that he positively re∣solves to have the Ministers and Strangers put into his hands. Thirdly, that our Arms must be laid down, and put into the hands of the Governour. Fourthly, that the Troops shall be let into the Vallies to pull down the Churches, and that there shall be no more exercise of our Religion. Fifthly, We hear that the Coun∣cil will by no means suffer the French Troops to come against us.
The Ambassadors had no sooner read these Letters, but they sent back the Deputies with another Letter, whereof two Copies were taken, and one of them sent to those of St. John and Boby, the other, to those of Angrogne, and de la Tour. This Letter shew'd them the vanity and little solidity of those Reasons upon which they ground∣ed their Resolution, not to accept of the Grace which was offer'd them. The Letter told them, it was not to be deny'd, but that the Law which oblig'd men to for∣sake their Countrey, was very severe, yet at the same time, the Law is much more rigorous, which forces men to forsake the Eternal God, and renounce the true Re∣ligion; that they ought to think themselves happy, that of these two sad extremities, they were left to their choice; which hap∣piness was denyed in France, to
People of great Birth, and known Merit, who were kept by force in their Countrey, and compelled to give themselves up to Idolatry. That the things of this World are subject to continual Changes; that Kings and Princes are often forced to quit their Crowns, and give up their Dominions to their Enemies; and therefore private persons ought without murmuring, to be subject to this common Fate, and submit with resignation to the De∣crees of Gods Providence, who by his chastisements tryes the faith of his Children, and takes off their hearts from this World, to make them the more earnestly seek af∣ter their Celestial Country. They had indeed reason to believe that God's arm which had supported them in former Wars, was not shortned; but that they ought to consider, God then had raised up their Neighbours to assist them, with Men, Money, and Officers;
then they had none but friends a∣bout them, whereas now they were compassed with Ene∣mies on all sides: Heretofore there were a great number of People among them able to bear Arms, but at present, they were deprived of all those advantages, their Prince alone was able to extirpate them, and yet his Forces were not the only Troops they had to en∣counter. That those of France were ready to fall upon them, and though they might be so fortunate to have the better in some of their first engagements, yet in the end, they must needs be totally over∣thrown by the multitude of those that would supply the places of the vanquished: That the division which was among them would be very prejudicial to them; That the refusing to accept the offer made by their Soveraign, would make all the Protestant Princes to forsake them, because they chose
rashly to take up Arms, rather than to follow the good Counsel which was given them. That they ought not to flatter themselves with the hope of some miraculous Deliverance, as was that which God gave the Jews, when he de∣stroy'd all the Army of Zena∣cherib. That in the Age wherein we live, God doth not work Mi∣racles in favour of his Church, as he did in the time of the Israelites. The Holy Scripture telleth us, that to cast our selves into dangers, out of which we foresee 'tis impossible to deliver our selves, is to tempt God, who forsakes those that wil∣fully run headlong into danger. That Christian Prudence, the Charity due to their Wives and Children, and that love they ought to have for themselves, did oblige them to follow the Example of other Inhabitants of the Vallies. That their Prince, looking upon them as Criminals, would seize
their Goods, and make them suf∣fer ignominious punishment, if they persisted in their resolutions. That seeing Divine Providence had blest their endeavours who interceded for them, it was plain that God would not have them proceed any further in the way they were going. That seeing a mitigation of the rigour of the Edict had been obtained for them, they ought to accept it; it was not the fault of those who had mediated, that their Condition was no better, and they might be assur'd, the Ambassadors would zealously endeavour to obtain for them somewhat of greater advan∣tage; but if that should be impos∣sible, yet they ought to accept of that which was offer'd, seeing in the state wherein they were, they could not capitulate with their Prince, who had Forces enough to compel them to obey him. That if they refus'd to submit to his
will, their obstinacy would not only cost them the loss of their Bodies, but also of their Souls; and they had reason to fear that they who escaped the Sword of their Persecutors, would at last perish under the cruelty of those punishments which would be in∣flicted on them, to force them to renounce their Religion. That they had no cause to fear, that the leave granted to them to re∣tire where they pleased, was a snare laid for them; seeing the Court gave them such security as ought to have quieted their Minds in that point, and satisfy'd them, that his Royal Highness would not suffer any thing to be done contrary to his promise, to stain his honour and reputation by publick perfidy, or fail in the re∣spects he hath hitherto had for the Evangelick Cantons. That if there had been a design to sur∣prize them, it might easily have
been done at first, but his High∣ness would not permit it, nor ever will for the future. In fine, the Troops of Savoy, and those of France, were ready to attack them on all sides, and yet they might be sure no harm would be done them, if they did submit to his Royal Highnesses Orders. The Ambassadors at their lea∣sure having reflected on his Royal Highnesses last Edict, were of O∣pinion, that the Vaudois would not submit to it without exposing themselves to very great incon∣veniencies, and therefore they re∣solved to renew their sollicitations, to procure better Conditions for them: They pray'd the Marquess St. Thomas to obtain an Audience from his Royal Highness; having obtain'd it, they told his Highness they had consider'd his last Edict, and had taken the liberty to make some observations upon the three principal points contain'd in some
Clauses of it, viz. In the first place, that Clause which gave the Inha∣bitants of the Vallies ten days time to go out of his Dominions; secondly, that which prescribed to them the number of six Proctors to sell their goods; and thirdly, that which for selling their goods allow'd them but three Months. They pray'd his Royal Highness to cast his eyes on the remarks they had made in the Memoir they had presented to him, and to consider, that to abate the rigour of his Edict could in no wise be prejudicial to his Highnesses Af∣fairs; but would be of great im∣portance to his Subjects, who had so great a respect, and so much affection for their Soveraign, that they could not resolve to leave his Dominions, because, in quitting their Countrey, they knew they should be deprived of being able to testify their fidelity in all occasions, by venturing their Lives in his
service; they therefore hoped his Royal Highness would shew his Clemency towards them, and give such Orders as were necessary for their going conveniently out of his Territories, and carrying all that with them which they could save of their Ship-wrack'd fortune; by this favour his Highness would give their Excellencies the Evan∣gelick Cantons a new occasion of continuing that affection and re∣spect to his Highness which they have always had for the Royal Family of Savoy; and as to their own particular, his Highness would convince them, that their good Offices had not been unsuc∣cessful, for those poor miserable People for whom they had in∣terceded. The Duke answer'd the Am∣bassadors, and said, That to shew the esteem he had for the Evan∣gelick Cantons, he had given his People testimonies of extraordinary
Clemency; that he had not cha∣stis'd them as they deserv'd, but had waited with patience their coming to themselves, and return∣ing again to their duty; that they having carried on their Rebellion to the utmost extremity, and given him new cause to complain, by the Insolencies they had of late committed, they had now ty'd up his hands so that he could not grant what they demanded, with∣out wounding his Reputation and his Authority. That his forbearing them, had drawn upon him great reproaches from France; however he was willing they should enjoy the benefit of his Edict, and if they expected, that the rigour of the Orders therein contained should be abated, they must ren∣der themselves worthy of it, by laying down their Arms, and submitting themselves to his Will. The Embassadors then delivered to his Royal Highness the following Memoir.
YOur Highness is most humbly pray'd to consider, That he who will, or must leave the Vallies, in Obedience to the Edict Publish'd by your Highness, is oblig'd to prepare himself for his departure; for the carrying away his Wife, his Chil∣dren, and his Necessary Goods: He must provide for the sale of his Corn, his Wines, his Provisions, and his Cattle, which cannot be left in his House without care taken of them: he cannot leave them with his Proctor who will be at Lucerne, and who by being at a distance cannot there∣fore take charge of them: That within the term of eight days a man cannot account, either with his Cre∣ditors or Debtors; because those with whom he hath had dealings, may perhaps not live in the Vallies, or because he may have accounts which cannot be adjusted without the interposition of some Arbitrator. That as to real Estates in Land, an
exact and particular description ought to be made of every Field, Vineyard, Meadow, Wood, their limits and boundaries set out, as also the rights appertaining to them, and the Sums for which they are engaged; and concerning all this, special and large Procurations must be given. Seeing therefore your Royal High∣ness mov'd by your Justice and Cle∣mency, hath been pleas'd to grant to your Subjects of the Vallies leave to retire where they think fit, and to sell their Goods which they leave behind them; it cannot be your Highnesses intention, that your Sub∣jects should be deprived of the Benefit and Effects of your gracious conces∣sions, by not allowing them time enough to depart, for that will be taking away with one hand, that which is given them with the other. Your Royal Highness is further humbly pray'd to consider, that six
Proctors are not enough to sell the Goods of some hundreds of Families who are willing to depart, and that the Employment cannot be given to any but people of the Country, and consequently to ignorant and unlear∣ned Persons, without capacity, en∣cumber'd with their own Affairs: besides, these Proctors must be obliged to run from place to place to get buyers, and to shew the Lands that are to be bought; they must pass Acts in several places before Publick Notaries, and must look after the sale of a great quantity of Goods disperst in divers Houses; they, must tell Money, change it, remit it to foreign Countries, and look after conveniencies to do it. They must clear Objections, remove Obstacles, defend themselves against unjust demands; They must receive Letters from those that are gone, and send them an account of their business; in a word, they will have a thousand other things to do,
which cannot at present be fore∣seen. Seeing then your Royal Highness doth not intend to make any advan∣tage of your poor Subjects Goods, nor to augment your Revenue with the Spoils of your People; your High∣ness would do well to permit them to name twelve Persons, who during the time granted▪ by your Royal Highness, may proceed to the sale of those Persons Goods who shall retire. But because it will certainly fall out, that during the term of three Months, be the Proctors never so diligent to sell the poor Refugies Lands, there will be found but few Buyers; and that every one will stay till towards the end of the said term, on purpose to take advantage of the necessity wherein People are, to put off their Estates, and to get them from these miserable People at a very low Price; they otherwise fearing they shall lose all. We hope
your Royal Highness will be so good as to remedy this inconvenience; and according to Covenants past with his deceased Highness of Glo∣rious Memory, in 1663. cause a valuable price to be given for those Lands and Goods, which could not be sold in three Months. Your Highness being so exempla∣rily good and merciful, certainly will not oblige any Person whatever to impossibilities, and therefore will readily dispence with Women who Lie in, or are near their time; and also with Old or Sick People, and not require them to observe the Law which you have prescribed to others concerning their retreat. That your Highness will be pleas'd to exempt them from quartering of Souldiers, who be they never so well disciplin'd, are always disorderly; that your Highness will likewise suffer them to live and die in their Houses, without fear of being ill us'd, and robb'd of their Goods and Provisions.
In fine, we earnestly pray, that your Royal Highness will be pleased to shew your Clemency towards those of the Vallies, who are in your Highnesses Prisons; and likewise towards those that have been taken upon their account, and be so Gra∣cious as to give them their Li∣berty. The Duke of Savoy when he received the Embassadors Memoir, promis'd to consider it, and said he would let them know his mind concerning it. While the Embassadors endea∣voured at Turin to do all the good they could for the Vaudois, those People took up a resolution, which prov'd their utter ruine; for whereas before the publication of the last Edict, the greatest part of them had resolved to seek out a retreat somewhere else; they now joyn'd all together in one common consent, to defend them∣selves against the Armies which
were ready to fall in upon them. In their Consultations, the Reasons given for this Resolution, were, that the Edict to which his Royal Highness required their sub∣mission, contain'd many things which they could not own, and others which they could not do; in the first place, they said it was not just, that they should be bound to acknowledge themselves guilty of the Rebellion wherewith they were charged, seeing they had done nothing against his Royal Highness's service, but that where∣to, for maintaining the Exercise of their Religion, they were oblig'd. Secondly, that they ought not to submit to the last Edict, be∣cause it confirm'd that of January 31. which deprived them of the liberty of serving God according to their Faith.
Thirdly, They could not re∣solve to obey the Command of laying down their Arms, because if they did, they should run the hazard of losing their Lives here, and their Souls hereafter, and be in a condition as bad as they were in former Persecutions, par∣ticularly those in the year 1655. when by woful experience, they found that some People made no scruple of breaking their word, and that which confirmed them in this Opinion, was, the Troops coming so near to them, notwith∣standing the Marquess St. Thomas had promis'd and assur'd them, none should enter into their Coun∣try till the term mention'd in the Edict was expired. Fourthly, That the time given to prepare themselves for their de∣parture, was too short, and that they could not comply with the Edict, because the number of their Valley Inhabitants was very great,
many were very old, and many others sick. Fifthly, It was impossible for their Goods to be sold by Attor∣nies or Proctors, and tho' they did resolve to sell them, yet it was upon condition they might receive the price they was sold for, before they went away, or to have it deposited in the hands of the Embassadors; that their E∣states likewise in the Mountains, might be sold as well as those in Plains, and also what they had in the French King's Territories; in fine, seeing the sale was to be made to Roman Catholicks, they had cause to fear the Ecclesiasticks would not suffer them to be sold, in confidence that they them∣selves should be masters of them, when all the Inhabitants were gone out of the Country. Sixthly, All things were to be feared from those who held it for a Maxim, that Faith was not to
be kept with Hereticks. The Ministers and such of the Vallies, who had most sense and reason, did all they could to hind∣er the People from coming to this extremity, but all the Arguments that were us'd would not divert them from their Resolution, not keep them from being led by those that flatter'd them with I∣maginary hopes of Succours; these were the Persons, who by per∣swading them not to accept of the Grace which was offer'd, were the cause of their destruction. By the following Letter it ap∣pears what art was us'd to make those People change their minds, and run headlong to their own Ruine.
From Roche Platte the 14th. of April. 1690. Most Illustrious, and most mighty Lords, I See no possibility of keeping the People of our Vallies within the bounds of their Duty, especially since a Minister of whose name you will hear, came hither; he hath so infatuated our People with confi∣dence that they shall be supply'd with all things, that there is scarce a Minister can be safe in his Church. All was quiet but the three Com∣munities of Boby, Angrogne, and St. John; and most People resolved to rely upon your Charity and Ad∣vice, and those of the best judgments would have prevail'd with the igno∣rant; who are in fault, either be∣cause they do not know, or because they do not confide in your Excel∣lencies. But among all, my Church la Tour was fully resolv'd to sub∣mit, till this Minister came, who
hath embroil'd all, except some pru∣dent Persons, who desire the parti∣cular Favour of your Protection, and to have free leave to depart, that they may retire to some place where they may serve God according to his Commandments. I am with all Respect and Humble Submission, your most Illustrious Excellencies, Most Humble, and most Obedi∣ent Servant, Girard, Mini∣ster of La Tour. In another Letter written by the Pastors of the Vally-Church∣es, there is a Postscript in these words. Mr.— Minister in the Church of Pinache, a Valley of Perouze, is come from—who, we verily be∣lieve hath given him Instructions to stir up and perswade, as he doth all people, to dye rather than submit to leaving their Country, tho' never
so many Promises be made them. This Resolution being reported to the Embassadors, they plainly saw that in the mind these People were, there was no appearance of making them change their Reso∣lution, or of bringing them to Reason. But however the Embassadors resolv'd to try once more, to per∣swade them to accept the favour their Prince offer'd, tho' it was not so advantageous as they wish'd, and considering the only way to make some impression upon them, was to make their Retreat less inconvenient and less troublesome than it would be, if the Terms of the Edict were to be observed; they fell to solliciting for an An∣swer to the Memoir they had presented to the Duke of Savoy, that in case it were favourable, they might send it to the Vau∣dois as the best Argument they
could use to prevail with them. But the Answer was not such as they desired, for the Marquess St. Thomas told the Embassadors, that his Royal Highness would not make a more ample, or any other Declaration, touching those things which were contained in his last Edict, because his Sub∣jects stood out so obstinately in their Rebellion, and refus'd to lay down their Arms, boasting they were in a Condition to re∣sist him; his R. H. therefore had resolv'd to part in two days, and go in person to reduce those Re∣bels to their Duty; but for those that would retire, they should up∣on his word enjoy the benefit of his Edict, and such as would not submit, should receive the punish∣ment they deserved. As soon as the Embassadors had left the Marquess St. Thomas, they dispatch'd a Currier to those of the Valleys, and by the following
Letter gave them notice what ill success they had in their Negotiati∣on. Sirs, IN the Private Audience we have had of his R. H. your Prince, we earnestly pray'd him to permit you to quit his Dominions upon bet∣ter and more favourable Conditions than those which are exprest in his last Edict. We represented to him as well Viva Voces as by a Memoir, those Reasons which we thought might prevail with him to miti∣gate those Orders which were al∣ready publish'd against you; We ear∣nestly pray'd him to grant you longer time to prepare your selves for so sad a parting, to sell your goods, to aug∣ment the number of the Proctors who were to make the sale; to suf∣fer the Aged, Sick and Weak, Wo∣men very big with Child, and those that lay in, to stay in the Country, free from ill usage, and from quar∣tering
of Souldiers; in fine, to give orders that the Proctors should buy those goods which they did not sell within the time specified in the Edict, but of all this we could obtain no∣thing from his R. Highness, because he knew you were in Arms to hin∣der the Executions of his Orders; We have also been with my Lord Marquess St. Thomas, and have en∣treated him to use his Credit with his R. H. to dispose him to grant that which we demanded in your favour; but he told us, that so long as you had Arms in your hands, you were to expect no favour: His High∣ness goes this day for Precairos, and we have had our Audience of leave, with intent to return presently to our own Country, unless Divine Providence give us an opportunity of being ser∣viceable to you; and seeing you will not follow the Advice of prudent Persons, but leave the event of your Affairs to God's Will: We pray that he will be pleas'd to support you in your Ca∣lamity,
and turn it to his own Glory, and your Temporal and Eternal good; recommending you to his Almighty Protection, We remain, &c. At Turin. Tho' the Embassadors now saw that the Affairs of the Vaudois were desperate, and to remedy them was impossible, they would not abandon those poor People, thinking they might some way or other be serviceable to them, if they follow'd his Royal Highness's Camp; and that they might so do, they prayed the Marquess St. Tho∣mas to ask his Royal Highness's leave. But the Marquess told them their presence might give some jealousie to the French Embassador, and to the Pope; therefore since his Royal Highness had great reason not to disoblige the most Christian King, the Embassadors did not in∣sist any more on that demand:
Things being in this condition, had his Royal Highness been never so well dispos'd to shew how much esteem he had for the Embassadors, yet he could not let them know how much he regarded their in∣tercession. When the Embassadors had their Audience of leave, they were told, if any occasion should hereafter bring them to Court, all deference should be paid due to their Character. They resolv'd to return to their Country, according to an Order which within few days they had received from their So∣veraigns, in a Letter written to them from Zurich; wherein the Protestant Cantons recalled them from their Negotiation, if they thought it would prove ineffectual. They supposing that the Mar∣quess St. Thomas, or some other Ministers, might find some favou∣rable opportunity to incline his Royal Highness to be merciful to
his poor Subjects of the Valleys, resolved to make them a Visit, and intreat them to have compassion on those poor Creatures, and do them all the good Offices that were in their Power; but the Court parting in great haste, it was im∣possible for them to do what they intended; and therefore they re∣quested that by writing, which they could not by word of Mouth. A little while after they receiv'd an answer from the Marquess, who assur'd them, that upon any over∣tures from the Vaudois, he would employ his utmost power to serve them. Some few days before the Em∣bassadors went a way, they receiv'd two Letters from the Valleys; one written by all the Communities of the Valley Inhabitants, directed to the Evangelick Cantons.
Most High and Soveraign Lords, OƲR Churches have a long time had experience, and espe∣cially in our present unhappy Trou∣bles, of your Excellencies unparallel'd Charity and fatherly Affection towards them, and that very lately, by sending the Lords Embassadors to his Royal Highness upon the Pub∣lication of his Highness's Edict a∣gainst us, of the 31 of January last past, as appears by the Letter they have been pleas'd to send us; we cannot sufficiently acknowledge the trouble, care, and pains our Lords the Embassadors have taken in our behalf, and for our Preservation; had they met with Hearts dispos'd to our Peace and Welfare, their continual Intercessions could not have fail'd of being effectual, but in that particular we confess we are in the Worlds opinion unhappy; nevertheless we return all possible thanks to your Excellencies, for the favours we
have received from your kind, pious, and Christian good Will towards us; we very well know, and confess it with great Confusion, that our Lords the Embassadors have not had from our People that satisfaction we could have wish'd, by resigning them∣selves into their hands; but we most humbly beseech them to Pity and support a People, who think they are bound in Honour and Conscience to maintain their Religion in their Country, where it hath been a long time miraculously preserved. We see, as to this World, our ruin is inevi∣table, but we hope God will revenge his Quarrel, and that good People will not quite forsake us: Our confi∣dence, next under God, is in your Excellencies; we cast our selves into your arms and Fatherly Bosoms, be∣seeching you by the Mercies of God, and in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ our Common Father and Sa∣viour, that you will not withdraw from us your Charity and good Wish∣es,
but look with your Eyes of Com∣passion and Fatherly tenderness, on so many poor Families, little Chil∣dren, and other infirm and in this World miserable People; and be pleased to make them feel the fa∣vourable effects of your Christian Bounty. Praying the Lord will per∣petually protect your Excellencies, and abundantly reward your pious and Christian Charity: We are, most High, Mighty, and Soveraign Lords, with all imaginable Veneration, your Ex∣cellencies Most Humble, most Obedient, and most obliged Servants, the Pa∣stors, Elders, and other Di∣rectors of the Valley Churches of Piemont. S. Bastie Modera∣tor, Gr. Malant Minister. The Letter which the Ministers wrote to the Embassadors, was Penn'd in these following terms. My Lords, WE will still Communicate your Excellencies Letter
to our Communities, it were to be wish'd they had given better ear to the wholsome Counsel given by your Excel∣lencies, to draw them out of a danger which in Humane probability seems unavoidable. God grant, against all appearances, that their Resolution may succeed well, and shew his pow∣er in their weakness and infirmity. I belive all their Pastors are re∣solved to live and dye with them, since your Excellencies are not a∣gainst it; it cannot certainly be ho∣nest or excusable to forsake them in such a conjuncture, and it must in∣fallibly be a reproach to us to leave them, seeing the good Shepherd is call'd to lay down his Life for his Sheep. We give your Excellen∣cies all possible thanks for the inde∣fatigable care and pains you have taken for our good, and for our preservation; and we be∣seech you, by the Mercies of God, and the Love of Jesus Christ, not to forget us, but during your stay at
Turin, and after your return to the most mighty Evangelick Cantons, to testifie your Affection and Christian Chairty towards us by all good Offi∣ces. We pray that our good God and Saviour will recompence your Excel∣lencies Pains and Charity towards our Churches, with his most Holy and Precious Blessings both of Heaven and Earth, and cover your sacred Persons with his continual Protection; which is the most fervent and sin∣cere Wish of yours, who are with a profound respect, My Lords, Your Excellencies most humble, most obedient, and most ob∣liged Servants, the Pastors of the Protestant Church∣es of the Valleys of Luzerne, Angrogne, Perouse, St. Martin, &c. in Piedmont, and in the name of all. S. Bastie Minister at An∣grogne, the 17th of April, 1686.
The Vaudois being resolved, as we have told you, and the Duke of Savoy gone to the Army; the Embassadors thought they had no more to do at Court, and therefore now might return home; but because it might happen that the Valley-People, seeing their danger near, and the Troops rea∣dy to fall upon them, might by the Mediation of the Embassa∣dors, have recourse to the Cle∣mency of their Prince; they re∣solved not to be far from them, till they saw the Army entred in∣to their Country, and had heard what was the success of this Ex∣pedition. But being informed that so soon as the French appear'd in the Valleys, those of St. Martin ran quite away, and that the Duke's Troops having forced the Passages on the side of Angrogne, found resistance no where, they plainly saw they had nothing more to do in Piedmont, and there∣fore
went away extremely griev'd that they could not hinder the desolation of the precious remaind∣er of the Valley Churches. And being come back to their own Countrey, they gave an account of their Embassy to their Sove∣raigns, who judging of their Ne∣gotiation, not by the success it had, but by the Embassadors Conduct; after having declar'd, they were satisfied with the Zeal and Ad∣dress which they had made ap∣pear during the whole course of this nice Negotiation, they thank∣ed them for the care they had taken to discharge so worthily the Employment wherewith they had been honoured.
