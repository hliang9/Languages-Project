W R DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, On February First, 1699. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Came to Pass the Bill for Disbanding the Army, as soon as I understood it was ready for Me. Though in our Present Circumstances there appears great Hazard in breakâˆ£ing such a Number of the Troops; and though I might think MySelf unkindly used, That those Guards, who came over with Me to your Assistance, and have constantly Attended Me in all the Actions wherein I have been Engaged, should be Removed from Me; yet it is My fix'd Opinion, That nothing can be so Fatal to Us, as that any Distrust or Jealousy should arise betwen Me, and My People, which I must own would have been very Unexpected after what I have Undertaken, Ventured, and Acted, for the Restoring and Securing of their Liberties. I have thus Plainly told you the only Reason, which has induced Me to Pass this Bill; And now I think Myself Obliged, in Discharge of the Trust reposed in Me, and for My own Justification, that no Ill Consequences may lie at My Door, to tell you as plainly My Judgment, That the Nation is left too much Exposed. It is therefore Incumbent upon you, to take this Matter into your Serious Consideration, and effectually to Provide such a Strength, as is necessary for the Safety of the Kingdom, and the Preservation of the Peace which GOD hath given Us. EDINBURGH, Re-printed by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer to the King's most Excellent Majesty, Anno Dom. 1699.
