A PROCLAMATION Commanding all persons who have been in Arms, or Assisted in the Wars against the STATE, to depart out of the Cities of London and Westminster and late Lines of Communication, on or before the Twelfth day of September instant. HIs Highness foreseeing the dangerous consequence that may arise to the Publique, as at other times, so especially now the Parliament is so near at hand, by the confluence and freedome of access unto the Cities of London and Westminster, and places thereabouts, of those Malignant and ill-affected persons, who have been in open hostility against the Common-wealth, and otherwise adhered unto, assisted, and abetted the Common Enemy, whose malicious restless spirits (notwithstanding their often disappointments, through the wonderfull mercy of God, who hath hitherto infatuated their counsells, and also notwithstanding the abundant grace and favour shewed them) are still working by all the pernicious ways and means they can, to sow seeds of sedition, secretly to undermine the Government establisht within this Common-wealth, and to raise new troubles in the bowells of these Nations▪ and involve them again in blood and confusion, as is evident by their treasonable Books and Pamphlets which they continually take the boldness to disperse and publish, thinking thereby to poyson the hearts of the well-affect∣ed people, and withdraw them from their obedience; Therefore His Highness upon advice with his Council, holding it most necessary to restrain the confluence and access of that party, to the said Cities of London and Westminster and places adjoyning thereunto, doth hereby Publish, Command and Enjoyn, that all persons abi∣ding and remaining within the Cities of London and Westminster, and late lines of Communication (not under restraint by imprisonment of their persons) who have been at any time in Arms against the State, or adhered unto, or wittingly or willingly assisted, encouraged, or abetted the Enemies thereof, do on or before the twelfth day of September instant (or if any of them be under such restraint, then within five days next af∣ter their respective enlargement) depart out of the said Cities of London and Westminster, and the late lines of Communication and all places within twenty miles thereof (unless it be the place of their constant habitation and residence for themselves and their Families) as they will answer the contrary at their perills. And that no such person do presume after the said twelfth day of September, to come within the said Cities of London and Westminster, or late lines of Communication, within the time hereafter limited. And His Highness doth com∣mand the Lord Maior and Aldermen of the City of London, and Iustices of Peace within the Cities of Lon∣don and Westminster, and the Liberties, Suburbs and Precincts thereof. As also within the several Coun∣ties of Middlesex, Hertford, Essex, Kent and Surrey, and the several and respective Officers of the Militia, as well within the said Cities and Liberties, as the Borough of Southwark, and Hamlets of the Tower of Lon∣don in their respective Limits and Iurisdictions, to this purpose, to cause strict wards and watches to be kept, and to make frequent and diligent searches for, and apprehend or cause to be apprehended, all and e∣very such person and persons as aforesaid, who shall be found within the said Cities or distance aforesaid, after the said twelfth day of this instant September, and forthwith to certifie their names, qualities and other cir∣cumstances unto His Highness or Council, to the end that such Offendors may be dealt withall, and proceeded against, as disturbers of the publick peace, and contemners of authority. And all Sheriffs, Baiilffs, Consta∣bles, Headboroughs, and all Captains of guards, Officers and Souldiers, and others the good people of this Common-wealth, are required to be ayding and assisting to the said Iustices of the Peace, Officers and Mini∣sters in the due execution of the premisses.

And His High∣ness doth admonish all those whom this Proclamation doth concern, to be so wary as that His Highness have not just cause to make them examples of contempt, which he must and will do, if after the said time limited for their departing as aforesaid, any of them shall be found to stay contrary to his said direction herein. Given at Whitehall the 6. day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1656. London Printed by Henry Hills and John Feild, Printers to His Highness. 1656.
