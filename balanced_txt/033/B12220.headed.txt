ESSAYES Or rather, ENCOMIONS, Prayses of SADNESSE: AND OF THE EMPEROVR IVLIAN the Apostata. By Sir WILLIAM CORNEWALLIS, the younger Knight. AT LONDON, Printed by George Purslowe, for Richard Hawkins, and are to be sold at his Shop in Chauncery lane, neere Seriants Inne. 1616.
To the READER. IF those precepts that aduise the pre∣uenting of the infirmities of the mind, haue bin euer more safe and sweet, thē theirs that like laws hold their peace vntil they haue them in their power, and then plucke them vp by the roots: is he that prescribes temperance be the best Physicion: hee the best Pilot that foresees a storme: he the best States-man, that vnder∣stands the dangers of his Countrey in their bud and greennesse: and in a word they the happiest Counsellors, that seeke to keep vs out of the contingency of perill: it is not impossible (Reader) but I may be of some vse to thee: But I prayse Sadnesse, so doth the Physicion his me∣dicine, which howsoeuer thy taste abhorres, thy reason desires, and being once downe, thou art content to forget the lothsomnesse, and regard the operation. I will com∣mend my prescription to thee no further, then that it cannot hurt; what good it may doe, let thy experience resolue thee; which the warranty of the safety may in∣uite thee to: If it wants those graces and embellish∣ments that he hath need of, that aduentures on an in∣nouation; let a plaine true tale be accepted better then a
filed falshood; especially since through the cloud of mine Ignorance truth shewes thee light enough, to direct thy way, though not to delight thee in thy iourney: I seeke not honour from thee, nor am I the subiect of thine opini∣on; thy censure shall onely concerne thy selfe: for mee, though I should hold my cloake the faster for the winde; yet shall I neuer yeeld it to the Sunne; he that feeles not their present power, needes not feare the future, and I am armed against both, either with a knowledge or a dul∣nesse of proofe: And so I leaue thee to thine owne iudge∣ment if thou hast one; or if thou hast not, to liue like the Moale by hearing: Farewell.
THE PRAYSE OF SADNESSE. THey that haue blessed their time with drawing into their owne bo∣somes the consideration of the world and her mutabilities; and kept them there, to strengthen their reason against the vanity & waywardnesse of their affections and passions, know already, I may offend opinion, but not truth, vndertaking as impertinent a worke, as he that intended to prayse Hercules: to these I addresse not my self, vnlesse they wil please to perfect me, since I cannot them. But to those I am directed, that ei∣ther the smyles of Fortune haue depriued of the true knowledge of the condition of man, or youth hath not yet ripened; or such vulgar and earthly crea∣tures, whose iudgement dazeled with beholding the outward splendor of Fortunes Minions (the misera∣blest of all) cannot or will not see with what terrible cares and discontentments, the purple robe is lined. I know, but feare not, the danger of cherishing and defending so vnwelcome a guest as sadnesse; so shunned, so abhorred: For since I am well assured,
they haue condemned rather her countenance, then her selfe: and that both her Iudge, Iury, and hang∣man, hath bin that acrie monster Opinion; that ta∣keth all vpon trust, and answers nothing with rea∣son; I was the rather inclyned to be her friend, be∣cause opinion was her enemy; the first proofe of her goodnes,The first proofe of her goodnesse. since she is hated, by so false and obstinate an enemy to wisdome and Iudgement. First then, because our humane weaknesse, and chiefely those that I desire to instruct, vnderstand best by contraryes; as health is best knowne by sicknesse, plenty by want, it is fit I shew them what mirth is made of: and ouer what a troupe she com∣mands; that beholding her, and her band disrobed and anatomized, wearie and ashamed of the sight, they may by putting off their preiudicat obstinacies, be made first hearers, and consequently obeyors, of a worthier conductor. What Mirth is.That mirth is a naturall quality of mans, I deny not, but withall, I think it one of those that he hath little cause to boast of; it is true that he makes mirth and sadnesse the ballance of his affections and pas∣sions, and is wayed by them: thus hee accounts his winnings and losings, and the same is expressed in sadnesse or mirth: but whether most of these sup∣posed winners, are not rather betrayed, then suppor∣ted; loosened, disordered, and corrupted; then strengthned, grounded, & instructed, I think there is no man that hath well obserued himselfe, and his passages considerately, but will affirme. Who can doubt of this, that knowes the slightnes of her composition? children make her of babies, and hobby-horses: yong men of sports, hawkes, horses,
dogs, or worse: old men of riches, Statesmen of a∣dorers, honour, and aduancement; Women of gay clothes, many louers, and flattering glasses: it is one God they adore, though worshipped in seuerall shapes: and though the difference amongst them makes them despisers of one anothers choice; yet to the vninteressed beholder, they play al at one game, though not all for one summe. Et que veneraris et quae despicis, vnus exae quabit cinis. Wee haue touched the ayme, and end: Let vs now see the pursuers and adorers of mirth; and they that make her the goddesse of their actions, a people either so light and imperciptible, as nothing can come beyond their senses: or so opinionatiue and obstinate, or rather so drunke with pleasure, as they will not knowe, what they may and must: or a third sort, that clap myrth between them and their con∣sciences, for feare of corrasiues, that keepe her vp like a ball, and run after her, to bee the further off from themselues, who might know, though Vinum, cantus, somnus, commot iunculas illas primas, non raro sanarunt irae doloris, amoris at nunquam aegritudinem, quae radices egit et fixit pedem, to caracterize these further then in generality, were needlesse: for what shall the picture need, where the originall is so com∣mon? with what other are brothell-houses, and Tauerns stuffed? Voluptas, humile, seruile, imbecillem, caducum; cuius Statio et formices et popinae sunt, what are the inhabitants of theaters, meetings, feasts, try∣umphes, but such as either acknowledge no God so willingly as Mirth and Pleasure; or such as dare not come home into themselues, for feare of their er∣rors and miscarriage?
In the meane time, O poore reason, at how base a price art thou sold? Or art thou but a name with∣out an essence? Or a broken Reed that the will of man dares not stay it selfe vpon, for feare of falling? Or els what a blue-eyed choyse is theirs, that for the most idle, momentary, and sicke effects of mirth, and pleasure, impawne not onely their time, (which is vnredeemeable) but themselues, which they thinke too well sold to repurchase. But now it is fit I hasten to them, who seeke not mirth, but are sought of her: for such is the lust of Fortunes benefits, as whilest the body feeleth her selfe able to purchase her desires, and to gorge her senses, she abandons herselfe to all sensualities, and reioyceth in her owne fulnesse: to you then, vpon whom none but fayre winds haue euer blowne in this careire of your supposed happinesse: can you see for all your high and ouertopping places, your end and resting place? Or are you not rather the arrowes of the Omnipotent arme, that are yet flying, not at yours, but at his marke: and are no more owners of your owne purposed ends, then you were guilty of your owne beginnings? In the meane time effeminated with your prosperity, and as it were still sucking vpon the brest of Fortune, if she turnes her backe and retires, how miserable doth shee leaue you? Still bleating after the teat, and like those nice creatures, that become tame with taking their bread from others hands, vnable to ad∣minister to your selues the least helpe or comfort. Wee doe see that Nature and all her producti∣ons support them and her selfe by incessant chan∣ges, and reuolutions; generation and corruption
being to the earth like riuers to the sea, in a restlesse current, and perpetuall progresse: doe wee see the flourishing and falling, not only of Kings and Prin∣ces; but of Kingdomes and Commonwealths, Cit∣ties, Trophies, and whatsoeuer the vaine imagina∣tion of man hath contriued for the ouercomming of time? and can we vpon some small remnant of Fortunes bounty, thinke to establish a perpetuity of mirth and pleasure? No, no, he that takes not this time to prouide for a world, and in the midst of his pleasures doth not thinke how fraile and transitory they are, will pay dearely for his iollity; when sur∣prised by death, or some disaster, they leaue him in an instant, so much more miserable then others; as he hath depended vpon such vncertainties: without which, his life is most lothsome vnto him, and with which, death most fearefull and abhorred. But to what end is all this tendred to the adorers and louers of mirth? Their heads and hearts are all ready filled with their own delights: which must be consumed by affliction, before the precious balm of Sadnesse can either enter or worke. Fabius said, he feared more Minutius victories thē ouerthrows: which may be rightly applied to the generall dispo∣sition of man, his successes infecting him with an ignorant confidence, intoxicating his reason with presumption and ostentation, which are such dayly effects of worldly prosperities, as they that thinke themselues Lords, are often the vnworthiest sort of slaues: and their opinionatiue happinesse, the most wretched misery: not vnlike the madde Athenian, that imagined himself possessed of al, whē indeed he was true honor but of his own distemper & lunacy.
To young men there belongs more pitty, aswell because nature hath her hand in this their thirst of pleasure: they beeing yet by the heate of bloud, and the quicknesse of their spirits, and the strength of their senses, iolly and gamesome: as also that it must be time, and the wounds and skars, gotten by their wretched carelesnesse, that must make them capable of aduice: since (as Plutarch sayth) their hea∣dy passions and pleasures set ouer them, more cruell and tyrannous Gouernours, then those that had the charge of their minorities: now who is it that lea∣deth this distracted dance, of youth, but mirth? for whose sake and pleasures they are inseparable com∣panions: what is irregular, indiscreet, vnlawfull, dishonest; nay, what lawes, either of mans natures, or Gods, are in these apprehensions, strong enough to containe them within their bounds? Galba in his adoption of Piso, amongst his other prayses sayth; you whose youth hath needed no excuse: a commen∣dation so rare and glorious, as there needed no more to illustrate his name and fame to all posterity; for who els, vnlesse fettered and chained with nature or fortune, but in their first wearing the fresh gar∣ment of youth, haue not soyled and spotted it; as their whole life after (though painefully and indu∣striously directed) hath not bin able to wipe out their faults, and refresh the glose of their reputation? hence it is, that Delicta inuentutis meae & ignorantias meas ne memineris Domine, is taught by all, and vsed by all; so ineuitable a disease is youth: of which we need no witnesse, since euery mans conscience doth iustifie it; the generality and antiquity, hauing made it veniall: and by consent, we bind none from these
slips and stumbles, but old men and and women: the rest passe the musters so farre from checking, as they produce many of their follies as the markes of spirit, and generosity: and by their will would make of an old vice, a young vertue: who can hope now to deliuer this flourishing season of youth, from these Caterpillers? since mirth and pleasure allures; opini∣on animates; and community hides them from the sight of themselues and actions: this it is that makes nothing more currannt, then to pay one ano∣ther with our faults, and no man trusts so much to his owne vertue, as to his neighbours or Compani∣ons vices; wee repose our selues in the defect of o∣thers, and no man striues further, then to be compa∣ratiuely good: we aduance our selues vpon ruins, and thinke our selues well, because another is worse: O lame shift! O drunken remedie! I will then say but this, to those young men that will heare me, Since you know not the way to true happinesse and con∣tentment; ask not of them that are yet in the race; but of them that haue passed it: propose vnto your selues some patterne to imitate, (nisi ad regulam prauam non corrigas) and to strengthen your iudgements, be∣hold those that haue already acted their parts: take one of these admirers of mirth and pleasure; and an other that hath euer made his reason the taster of all his actions: and compare these together, and then chuse which of them you would be: there cannot thus farre off bee so corrupted a iudgement, as not to know the best; the difference is then a little time, & hoc quod senectus vocatur, pauci sunt circuitus amorū: Behold then the match, for a few yeeres to boote, this vicious hatefull person is taken, that deuoured
his owne honour and reputation: and with his plea∣sure swallowed euen his very soule, and that liues now but in his infamy: rather then that well ordered spirit, that hath left a true and perfect circle of a dis∣creet gouern'd life and death, and left the world heire of many rich and worthy examples: who in this consideration, but must crie out with the Psal∣mist, O what is man, that thou art so mindfull of him, &c? or why hauing taken our iudgements thus hal∣ting, should wee reply vpon it? carrying vs through the world; that in our entrance hath thus stumbled and fallen: he hath then the first signe of recouerie, that in this his beginning mistrusts his owne wayes; and dares offer his wounds to the Surgeon: it is an incurable ignorance, that dares not put it selfe to mending. Plato would haue offenders repaire to the Iudge and Magistrate, as to the Physicions of the soule, and submit themselues to punishment, as to the medicine of recouery, but this was too high an imagination for practise; yet thus farre we may goe, and vpon the ground; and not in the ayre: hauing, vpon a due examination, found it fit to mistrust our selues, it followes euen in common reason, not to throw our selues rashly into any action: but to assist our weaknesse with gaining consideration time: this disarms our passions of their violence, for their moti∣on being out of heat, and neuer going but running, being once stayed, and ouertaken by reason, they af∣ter willingly submit themselues vnto her▪ and are easily managed: It is an axiome in Philosophy, that our first motions are not in our owne power: which is true no longer then we list: for he that will not im∣barke himselfe, without a pause and deliberation,
dissolues the Acrimony of his affections; and makes them of the cruellest Tyrants the most profitable ser∣uants. It is true, our ignorance and sloth make eue∣ry thing terrible vnto vs: and we wil not because we dare not, and dare not because we will not: this makes vs submit our selues to any thing that doth ei∣ther flatter or threaten vs: and like some sottish weak∣lings, that giue the reines of their gouernment, into the hands of their wiues or seruants; thinking then they buy their peace, when they sell it: thus do they grow vpon vs, and by composition, not force, be∣come masters of the place; being iust so strong as we are weake. The scouts of Antigonus relating vn∣to him the multitude of his enemies, and aduising by way of information the danger of a conflict, that should be vndertaken with so great an vnequality: he replied, And at how many do you valew me? In this ciuill wars of our selues the first disorder and conse∣quently our ouerthrow proceeds frō a false valuation of our owne strength: we are content to imbrace our owne true naturall worth, so wee may haue leaue to yeeld our selues to some furious passion or soothing affection: but would we now take a true knowledge of our owne valew, we might easily redeeme our selues: God and nature haue not dealt so tyrannical∣ly with man, as to giue him charge of that he cannot hold: if we lose the game it must be by play: where∣fore since we are likely to bee besieged by the world, and her allurements; lest famine or treason sur∣prise, let vs turne out of the walls, all vnprofitable pleasures; and knowe betimes that mirth becom∣meth neither the fortune, nor condition of man: so is hee enuironed with dangers, and so subiect
to intrappings, omnis vita supplicium est, there is no day, houre, or moment, that brings a certaine cessa∣tion of armes: but to the contrary, our life is a conti∣nuall war-fare, representing vnto vs incessant dan∣gers and perils: wherefore wee must alwayes stand vpon our guard, and keep a straight watch vpon our selues; not only examining the humors that goe in and out, their arrants, and pretences: but euen euery motion and thought; for of so many different pieces is the little world of man compounded: so stirring, so infatigable, so full of changes and counter-changes, so sodainely eleuated, as soone deiected: and in a word, such a composition of contrarieties; as he that doth not continually obserue himselfe, and steddily fixe his eyes vpon all his actions; shall sodainely grow a stranger to himselfe, and be vtterly ignorant of his owne proceedings: if this then be a time for mirth, we may easily imagine; who doth not alone call all the parts and faculties of man from their du∣ties and charge, to feast and glut themselues with sensualities; but returneth them so corrupt and de∣baunched, as like Hannibals army, after their winte∣ring in Campania, they cannot bee knowne for the same men; so haue they melted their courages with delicacie, and with ryot made themselues impatient, and almost incapable of discipline. To conclude, such is the weaknesse of man, and so strong are his bodily inclinations, as if he doth not diuert or breake the force of his affections, reason alone is not able to resist them: wherefore as Plato allowed old men, mirth and wine, to reuiue nature almost tyred in her long iourney, and to refresh their spirits benum∣med with the coldnesse of their dwelling: by the same
reason, it is forbidden youth, whose bloud being now at the hottest, by the least addition, or increase, falls into the diseases of excesse, the most violent and vnresistable extremes: wee see then it is prescri∣bed but for a medicine, and by the difference of the constitutions of young men and old, it can bee no more wholsome for the one, then dangerous for the other: howsoeuer since it is prescribed medicinably, the too frequent vse, must either destroy the operati∣on, or leaue onely the malignant quality aliue and vncorrected, vnto those whom the out-side of For∣tune dazels and allures, there is nothing to be sayd by way of aduice; being such, as neither nature, nor education hath fauoured, but are left to act the base and illiberal parts vpon this stage of the world: this is the multitude, the vulgar, the people that are bought and sold, and reckoned by the hundred and the thousand, and beare no price single and alone; a madnesse it were then, to thinke to moue and con∣uert them together, when our Sauiour that fedde 5000. of them, and as many heard him, could nei∣ther with the admirablenesse of his miracles, nor the excellency of his doctrine preuaile with them all, and returne them all beleeuers: this were sufficient to deterre mee euen from but touching vpon this quick-sand, were they not the harbour of opinion, where shee is still rescued from the louers of truth: neither is it impossible that some, yet of her and their party, vpon a truer information may forsake and bee ashamed of their station, or to be a piece of the body of this great Beast. There is nothing can enter into consideration more strange and improbable, then to see euen the
most actiue and vnderstanding spirits, to refer them∣selues and their proceedings to the multitude, to esteeme themselues at their price, exceeds their me∣mories and powers of satisfaction. The young man that thought to escape the being seene in a Tauerne, with retiring further into it, was iustly reprehended for going further in: but such is the nature of vice, it hath an alluring looke, and a detayning tayle, our de∣sires first allure vs to things vnlawfull, and when we are there, our feare bars vs in; but if euery man knew how much more right he might haue from his owne tribunall, if he will freely and sincerely giue his reason her owne power, and how iustly an vnabu∣sed conscience will proceed, and how sweetly and securely he sleeps, that hath receiued from them his quietus est, he would for euer disclaime the censure of opinion; and with Phocion mistrust himselfe, because the people praysed him: erubuit quasi peccasset quod placuerit: and as the Prince of morality aduiseth, Non respuit quid homines turpe iudicent aut miserum, not it, qua populus; sed vt scidera contrarium mundo i∣ter intendunt, ita hic aduersus opinionem omnium radit: but thus far had I gone out of the way, had I not pur∣sued opinion. To come now neere our purpose, in examinati∣ons, circumstances are not neglected, if they any way conduce to the end of our inquiry: thus Iudges and Magistrates make their vses & aduantages of names, and countenances, though it be impossible to make either so much as accessary: first then we finde, that Sadnesse hath euer beene receiued as a witnesse of truth; as In Sadnesse amongst honest men, is taken for an infallible asseueration: whereas mirth hath so
little credit, as when rashnesse or falsenesse hath made an escape, by the tongue, the refuge is to lay it to mirths charge: who as a licensed Buffone, hath often leaue to passe the bounds of modesty & truth: againe, mirth is so like drunkennesse, that they are at this day, but as two names of one thing, and mer∣ry, meanes drunke, and drunke merry: whereas so∣ber expresseth a discreet temper, to rayse and deiect themselues at the pleasure of their breathes, to take warrant from their countenances: and in a word, to liue and dye at their appointments: when single, they scorne and despise them, and thinke euen their best thoughts scarce worthy of their foot-boy, yet the patterne and piece differeth not; and any one as farre as sufficiency expresseth the whole, as Physi∣cions say of the diseases of the body that are, and the same may come from different causes: so this of the mind, which proceedeth either from the laying their ambitious hopes vpon popularity, or such as guilty of their owne intentions, dare not put them∣selues vpon the tryall of their consciences. A third sort there are, that feede, and cloath, and talke, and walke, and haue deliuered themselues and their behauiour to bee brought vp by Opinion; these since they cannot be separated from the multi∣tude, neither can be, nor are worth the singling: for those that Ambition hath perswaded to this popular folly, they are worthy to bee deceiued: and were it not, that in all inordinate desires reason is first van∣quished, they could not but know; this beast is tame but in fayre weather; they loue that part of you which they vnderstand, which is your fortune, loue and friendshippe begins in the soule, and ends in the
body: and theirs begin in the body and ends in the fortune: the two lignaments that tie the men to a iust∣nesse and decorum in all their actions, are wit and honesty; which they being defectiue in, can no more loue truely; then hee can speake that is borne dumbe. Wherefore further then commiseration, and the common duties of humanity, it is a madnesse to be popular: for as they say, the chiefe strength of the Lyon lieth in his tayle, so theirs in their mouthes; which as it deuoures all you giue, so they goe no fur∣ther to pay for all they take. It is true, Vbicunque homo est, ibi beneficio locus ect: thus farre charity commands, and further is ridiculous, or dangerous, or both: in Princes vnto whom they belong as a charge, and who hath power to make them feare, if they will not loue, popularity is no vice, but a part of vse, and as dangerous for them to neglect, as for a priuate man and a subiect to follow and affect. We haue nothing more common and in practice amongst decayed beauties, banquerouted by time or accidents, then to hide it from others eyes with art, and from their owne with false glasses: no other∣wise is it with them, that from the reflection of opini∣on behold the state and condition of their minds; surely hee is afraid to heare truth, that dares not in∣quire of himselfe: it is against our wils, if we transport to forraine eyes, or eares, any wares that are not sub∣stantiall, or at least formall: they are in the darke, and visible but to our selues, that are fit for reformation: and as we know best their begettings and births, so are they the naturall subiects for our owne con∣sciences to worke vpon: it is long since receiued, that in one, and the selfe same man, there may be a good
man, and an ill Citizen; men and lawes take know∣ledge of vice, no farther then their owne interest: diseases that threaten but one, are opposed but by one, they are contagious and infectious, that are re∣sisted by generality. They then that goe to opinion, to knowe the temper and disposition of their minds, go to the market, rather to sell then to buy: and loue better to paint the walles and outsides of themselues, then to rectifie and repaire their inward errors and defects: but farre worse it is with them that dare not come to tryall, where their facts and actions are knowne, which is at home: is not this like children, which shunning the reprehension and chastisements of one fault, multiply it to many? Or like the carelesse debtor, that suffers the interest to outgrow the principall? How truely doth this proue the cowardise of vice, or rather the sottishnesse, since he considers not, that as fast as hee runs from feare, the same haste he makes to desperation, where they ineuitably end, that neuer reckon with themselues, till the summe vnimpeached by drinke or any other excesse? For the continuance, what men carry more mis∣trust before them, then those, that haue worne out the sobrietie of an honest looke, with a continuall girning or laughing? a marke of natures, so seldome failing, as it is in euery obseruatiō held, for an irreco∣uerable defect either of wit or honestie: of such stuffe are commonly flatterers, time-pleasers, & faunguists made: people so obnoxious to vertue and worth, as were it not that they breed & liue only vpon the lust of Fortune, it were impossible to keepe them from a generall extirpation. For it is they that haue berea∣ued
greatnesse and riches of innocency, and made it of a dead and indifferent instrument in the power of the disposer, to haue hatched more monsters then all the broode of vices besides: and in a word haue been the visablest and chiefest procurers of the hea∣uy sentence of our Sauiour against rich men; that it is easier for a Camell to passe through a needles eye, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. In the contemplating Sadnesse, and mirth, mee thinks, I see the true formes of the two Ladies that offered themselues to Hercules, at his entrance into the way of the world, Vertue, and Pleasure, the first with a settled composed countenance (not vnlike the South sea) full of peace, certainty, and truth: no o∣uerruling passion disordering or raising the least bil∣low, or moouing the smallest breath of perturbation: the other like a shop that sets out the best wares to the view, and offers many pleasing morsels to the senses, and at the first seemes to resemble bounty it selfe in freenesse and sweetnesse; but alas, she is too soone wonne to be constant, shee brings not in your reckoning, til you haue consumed what she set before you, and then you shal know they are too deare, when it is too late to refuse them: her smiles and allure∣ments, are like the sun-shine daies of winter, storm-breeders: her cleerenesse, warmth, and calmenesse, produce euer cloudes and tempests; repentance, griefes and anxieties of the soule; and as Phisicians hold, a continuall requiring stomake an infallible Symptomie of a corrupt and diseased body: so may be said of the louers of Mirth, that passe from one plea∣sure to another, and dare not let their braines settle,
lest they should see their owne deformities, their corrupted manners and the leprosie of their minds. Hitherto Sadnesse hath gotten but a preemi∣nence, and hath but prooued her selfe better then a worse; not approoued her owne goodnesse: it is now time, to display her in her owne excellency, not such a one as reuerts all things vpon it selfe, and re∣gards no quality that returnes not laden with profit; but such a communatiue goodnesse, as growes not poore by imparting; but redoubles it owne strength, riches, and splendor, with lending, assisting and diui∣ding it influence on others: but before I offer her, and her qualities to the view, it is necessary I deci∣pher her: Philopamen, for want of an interpretor, was set to cleaue wood by his hostesse, for his owne entertainment: the eye is a nice, busie & vndertaking sence, if reason or iudgement prepare not her way. I meane not then, vnder the name of Sadnesse, to defend effeminate bewailings and lamentations; let them a gods-name, that subiect themselues to this weakest impatience, be also subiect to the Lycian law; that bound these kind of lamentors to be arraied like women; nor am I an approuer, of a ridgid, sowre, morose austerity, since it is seldom other then the vi∣sard of enuy, or vain-glory: such were Nero his Philo∣sophers, nec deerant qui voce vultu{que} tristi inter ob∣lectamenta Regia spectari cuperent: neyther is it a small motiue to their condemnation, that the no∣uice and inquirer after vertue is deterred, to see her disciples so ouer-clowded and drowned in heauines: rather like the followers of a Funerall, then her mi∣nions and beloued, whose power and bounty doth not alone extend it selfe vnto all deseruers, but
makes all liues, fortunes, and accidents, not alone tolerable and to bee indured; but sweet, wholsome, easie and oft times glorious, and exemplare: neither will I prayse a sorrow, that as Pythagoras sayth, eates his owne heart; that abandons the rudder in a storm, and dares not liue for feare of dying. Wise men know, it is the condition of humanity to be tossed with contrary winds, and those are the seasons of distinction between wise men and fooles: euery man lookes gayly in a holiday fortune, but to be basely set by, and to shine through an obscure for∣tune, illustrates the riches and pretiousnesse of the mind: man hath not the throwing of the dice, but the playing of the cast: he is Lord ouer his intenti∣ons, the other part reacheth vp to heauen: where successes and effects are deliuered backe, not accor∣ding to the appetite of man, but the inscrutable wis∣dome of God, and vpon that wee ought to rest our selues, not onely with patience, but with comfort; that the onely fountaine of knowledge hath taken it into his owne hands, of whose better disposing, it were the greatest impiety and infidelity to make the least doubt or question: but it is sadnesse that pre∣pares vs for the acting of this and the rest of our life truely; and as we ought: who must not be vnder∣stood to be of the discent of Niobe, still labouring in teares and exclamations: nor a vaine-glorious or enuious Philosopher, that bigge with his owne pro∣fession, labours to proclaime it in his lookes: nor a silent fretting sorrow, that will needs marry his affli∣ctions:A true descrip∣tion of Sad∣nesse. but Sadnesse whose portrature I would pre∣sent from the generall state and nature of man, hath drawne her selfe into an habite or posture; in some
places fit to resist the incursions of her enemies: in others to diuert them, and sometimes like a wise Conquerour; making them of the cruellest foes, as∣sured friends or louing subiects: her outside is sober, calme, constant, modest, and for the most part silent; her inside full of peace, industry and resolution. To reduce these into a shorter and sounder way, what knowledge, art, or science is there, more neces∣sary and important, then that which is wholly deuo∣ted to the ordering of our life? this doth Sadnesse most aptly and effectually: first instructing, then ad∣orning, and lastly, gouerning the life of man, with so much tranquillity, certainty, and happinesse, as if we will trust either reason or example, we shall find no liues to carry so continual a contentment as these: nor none so often, and so continually miscarry as the contrary. Since then in these are comprehended the whole course of mans life, we will draw the picture of Sad∣nesse within this compasse: so shall I not prayse her more then profit my Reader: or if I faile, an vnskil∣full Painter may spoyle a picture, but not a face; which a worthier vndertaking, may purchase glory, by the spoyles of my imperfections: since it is not then with man, as with other creatures, that are in∣dowed with the greatest part of their vnderstanding, at the very entrance into the World, which being bounded and limited within a selfe preseruation, ex∣tends no further then to a present consideration of them and theirs: as it is a naturall propertie infused rather into their being, then into them; & rather to the profit of nature, and her conseruation, then for their particular benefit: as at the first it is straight, and
narrow, so time ripens it not, nor dilates it: farre o∣therwise it is with man, whose reason growes with him, and whose iudgement (as not compatible with his youth) is deliuered vnto him when he comes to age: at least his minority is but the seed-time: in his Autumne comes his haruest, that is the time of his instruction; this of vse. Women enemies to true Sad∣nesse.Now, whether it be from the pride of man, that loues not to looke so low as his infancy, or the con∣tempt he hath to impart his time to a poore lumpe of flesh, or that since Nature hath forced him vpon women, he thinks to turne the imperfections of time vpon the imperfections of Nature, and that they are fittest to breed & hatch their puling wayward weak∣nesses: whether from one, or from all, or from some more hidden cause: certaine it is, that to the most men in particular, & to the common-wealth in gene∣rall, there ariseth great losse, by sacrificing these their first yeeres, vnto their tuitions: from hence it comes, that when Poets would set vp a marke for imitation, they durst neuer trust a woman, so much as with their nursing; but borrowed of their imagination, either a Goddesse or a Nymph, or rather then faile, a meaner creature. Some Philosophers would allow them, no more interest in our conception, then to receiue che∣rish, foster, and re-deliuer vs: but alas, the large por∣tion of the imperfections that we inherit from them, assures vs the contrary: but since it is so much; as time, reason, instruction, and whatsoeuer the wit of man can apply, can neuer vtterly expell; hardly cor∣rect, or temper: what a stupid carelesnesse, raignes ouer the world, to increase our defects, by inlarging their time of gouernment.
But neither to offend them, nor stay further from my subiect; their dispositions will not take the rich colour of Sadnesse, which euer yeeldes that tranquil∣lity & settlednesse of mind, that can propose the end, and prosecute the way, without diuersion, or error: at least, without those that disioyne our intentions; and ouerthrow our purposes: wheras (the very springs of passions & affections) take & change their forms, at the pleasure of euery representation, not vpon a deliberated iudgement; but according to the con∣sultation and conclusions of their sences. Thus when we may see the power of Sadnesse, for instruction; since they that want it, are not to be tru∣sted with education, yet not to leaue enemies behind vs, though I wish we might obserue their order, that set wild birds egges, vnder those that are domesticke and tame, to alter their wild condition into their fo∣ster-mothers more milde and familiar: and so could wish our dry nurses were men, & such as could teach them words made of reason, as well as winde; and though there be many seuere, (if not malicious) cen∣sures giuen vs, by our forefathers, against them in all ages, and by all countries, and by all professions; of which infinit cōcurrence of censures, I will giue but one instance, nelle cose di consiglio in vna dnna, e ca∣pace di poterlo dare ne meno di pigliarlo per se e tanto pggio da teneclo secreto mat; yet doubt I not, but they are owners of such perfections, as bounded, and kept in their owne circumference, are of much vse and pleasure: and they are to be honoured by vs, no lesse then our mother earth, from whom wee no sooner come, but wee striue to returne againe: to con∣clude, since we cannot be without them, it is great
reason, they should be entertained with a due respect: which is rather sweetly, then seriously: let them haue their owne interest religiously answered; and for more, since it but corrupts them, and shackles vs; whatsoeuer old men and mad men doe, or haue done; wise men for their sakes, will attend their charge, with more circumspection. If then we desire to frame a man that shall deserue his being, and to be master of himselfe and time: let vs begin betimes, to set such Gouernours ouer him, as may both by their examples, and instructi∣ons, dayly reflect vpon him, and infuse into him the grace, and most instructiue influence of Sadnesse, for by this meanes hee liues fortified against the grand corrupter of youth Pleasure: and the violent enemy of Age, Griefe. Surely the beame that keeps the co∣gitatiōs of man euen, is none other then Sadnesse: for hee that thinkes to buy his peace with accumulating riches, or to be too strong for fortune, with making himselfe powerfull, doth but apply an outward me∣dicine for an inward disease: which though it may sometimes ease, seldome cures: but Sadnesse, that keepes vs at home, daily shewes vs the brittle frail∣ty of all exterior things (which makes vs like an Ar∣my pestered with too much carriage, neither fit to fly nor fight) vnites our inward powers, defends our reason, from the vapours and mists of our affections; and standing betweene the extremes of mirth and sorrow, is the onely perfit moderator of our hu∣mane actions. Cato, though he had many learned slaues, would not commit the education of his son to them, but himselfe became his instructor: which I attribute to no other consideration, then that he ra∣ther
chose, to frame him to a wel composed Sadnesse, then to be excellent in any Art or Profession: vt modestior, non vt lepidior fiat, a perfection fitter for a mechanicke earner, then a true owner of himselfe: since it is the forming of the minde, not the tongue or hand, that can preferre vs to true felicity. Now that we may touch as it were with our finger how much Sadnesse conferres, towards a perfit in∣struction; what is more proper and peculiar to the forming and framing of the mind to wisedome and goodnesse, then first to keepe out vice, and then so to worke, prepare, and temper the mind, as it shall be alwaies fit to receiue & containe the wholesome documents of vertue and honestie? Which doth Sadnesse, so naturally and effectually, as all other things, that offer themselues for this vse, are in com∣parison, left-handed, and stepmothers to educati∣on. First then, as one sayth pretily in his imagined wife, that he would haue her, of a denying behaui∣our; as if a fort accessiuely scituated, could not bee impregnable, since assaultable: and as he saith there∣fore, he comes too neere, that comes to bee denyed, and as Ouid, that great trader into those parts, could neuer find armor of proofe for Chastity, but not to be prooued, casta est quam nemo rogauit, she's chaste, whom no tongue yet did taste: so doubtlesse, he shall passe the narrow way of Vertue, with fewer impedi∣ments, that his owner of this sober preuentiue beha∣uiour, then those alluring countenances, which keep open house for all commers: one Phylosopher would haue bolsters made, to stop the eares of yong men, from contagious noysome sounds; but he that
hath made Sadnesse his Porter, shall not need them, since his very presence deters and checks their loose imaginations, and they dare not confesse themselues to him, that hath their condemnation written in his face: hoc secum certe tulisset, neminem coram Catonem peccare. Pedlers open their wares willingest to wo∣men and children: in a word, as they say the Amatist preuents drunkennesse, so is Sadnesse the preserua∣tiue against the entrance of a number of vices. Will wee then frame a man fit to command and obey? to gouerne others and direct himselfe? a man so squared by the vnfaileable rules of wisedome and iudgement, as to know how to become all pla∣ces, and to vse all fortunes? Bind his tender youth to a disposition tempered with Sadnesse: for this man can neither seduce his minority with ill examples, nor marre his waxen age, with a false impression, too common a condition of these dissolute times: where our children with their milke, and their very first words, sucke in obscene speeches, and dissolute be∣hauiour: and imitation, and custome, hath giuen them the very habite of vice, before they haue ei∣ther loued, or chosen them. But this falls not out to the pupils that are gouer∣ned by men of this carriage: for since it is resolued, that this Sadnesse is not an accident of their com∣plexions, but a gard hammered out of their discourse and the issue of a happie matched discretion and ex∣perience: they doe already so well know, that all the allurements of vice offer themselues, but like play∣ers and iugglers, to shew you sport, and to gaine by you: and this word recreation, is but the outside of times wastfull and wilfull consumption: and that not
onely the houres so spent, are vtterly lost; but which is farre worse, this continuall excitation of the besti∣all part of man, prouokes his lustes and sensualities vnto an vnquenchable dropsie. Doubtlesse, as complexions are apter to the in∣fection of bodily diseases, one then the other; so behauiours to the contagion of the mind: mirth is made of pleasure, and with pleasure all vices are bai∣ted; whereas this Sadnesse is the complexion of a mind that knoweth this, and therefore hates and dis∣daines Mirth: I know experience is the chiefest eui∣dence, that age can produce to proue their right to wisedome; but that which makes their iudgements strong inough, to make their experience of more vse, then a bare tale, is a decay of their senses, growne too weake to trade for themselues, and the fitter to be set to our reason to make vp a true harmony of all the parts, to the good and preseruation of the whole: the same effect hath Sadnesse with young men, that this decay of nature hath with old; for when the con∣senting part, or will of man, is so rectified with a sad consideration of the true valew of all that the senses present vnto her; well may they long to please them∣selues, with their seuerall obiects: but when that de∣sire hath no other aduocate but it selfe; it soone lan∣guisheth and forsaketh it suite: Eschines aduice to an inquirer after the best course of life, was, to goe to the Church willingly, to the Warres vpon necessity, but to Feasts vpon no tearmes: what was this, but to praise the conseruation of Sadnesse, which in these assemblies, is for the most part betraied: and in the heat of Wine, meat, and company, melted, into the customes of dissolute mirth? which made the wise
Romane complaine, that hee neuer came amongst men, but returned lesse man, then when hee went out. This made the Phylosopher that fell a sleepe at a feast, hold his tongue with one hand, and with the other, the part that they say women loue best, but not to speake of: as the two taps, at which Mirth and Pleasure are drawne out. But may I not seeme to go too much of one hand, when proposing instructions, I incline rather to pre∣uentions then additions: surely if the nature of man were so pure & simple, as it had no participation nor cōmixture with contrarieties & repugnances, there were no way but one; and that one direct: but as he is first in his masse, or corporial substance, the issue or production of the 4 grand Heterogimical bodies, and after by the seuerall and most differing powers of his reason and will, as vnlike in their likenesse and natures, as light and darkenesse: there being as much to shun, as to follow: I hope I shall not erre in my way, if the scituation of the end proposed, drawes me sometimes about, since I vndertake to conduct, not the eye, but the vnderstanding. Neither will my Reader (I hope) hold himselfe de∣ceiued, if Sadnesse alone, and by it selfe, onely brings not in all the materialls necessary to the composing of a perfit man, and the framing a happinesse to the full extent of our earthly condition: for such an ex∣tract is not to be drawne, from a knowledge so ouer-clowded as mine, let it suffice then and it will: (my indifferent Iudge) that it is of so much vse and im∣portance, as though with it onely you cannot make this purchase, yet without it, if it be not impossible,
yet at least most difficult, and withall, that though the soule in her reuoluings and trauels, may meet those solid considerations, that are most like her selfe, wherein as in a glasse she beholds her own beauties: yet are they transitory, and but the flashes of her a∣gitation: the habituall possession of the graces of the mind, being to be fixed vpon no body, that Sadnesse hath not first prepared. This made so many of the Ancients, and of those most memorable, for the ex∣cellencies of the minde: some to throw away their wealth, others to refuse riches, the graces of Princes, and the fauour of the people: others pull out their owne eyes, and some to abandon the society of man; and euen he that might truliest be intituled, Deliciae humani generis, he that had the attribute,Socrates. to fetch ver∣tue from Heauen, and to place her in Cities; to bring her from the paradise of the gods, and transplant her in the brests of men: no doubt embraced a wil∣full pouerty; nay euen life it selfe, which he was of∣fered at the easiest rate, he would not yet accept of, as too delicate and nice a thing, for a worthy and he∣roicke spirit, to make account of. If now wee enter into the consideration of the motiue that made these men shun what all the world so earnestly pur∣sue: what could it be but to keepe these wants afoot, continually to admonish them, of their condition, and to cut off all wayes, by which mirth or pleasure might make their approches or come to the assault. Alexander in the excesse of abundance, killed Cly∣tus, Fabritius in his pouerty, refused the golden bribes of the Samnites; vpon abundance waits mirth and pleasure, and vpon them all, the leprosies and deformities of our minds.
There is not so incorrigible a creature as man in prosperity, nor so modest and reformed as they that Fortune hath not rockt but wak't, the consequence of which being Mirth and Sadnesse: behold them in their operations, and wee must reiect the one, as a most dangerous poyson, and imbrace the other, for the most precious preseruatiue. If yet I haue not proued Sadnesse, instruction it selfe: yet I hope she doth not look with so disfigured a countenance, as when Opinion paints her: and though I cannot say, she is the end of knowledge, yet I may well maintaine her the beginning: since it is Sadnesse onely that prepares the vnderstanding, and makes euery man, Idoneus auditor, fit to philoso∣phize, and to be disciples in the schoole of Vertue. If now it be determined and truely, that the gra∣ces and beauties of the soule, ought to haue the place and honour, aboue those of the body: and the sweet∣nes, beauty and louely proportion of the body, to be preferred before the effeminate deckings, that the body doth rather carry then enioy: since it often hap∣pens, that a foule and deformed carkase hath a faire and rich wardrop: and if all these in their originall estimations, were first valued, not for their owne sakes, but as the Ambassadours of those inward qua∣lities and excellencies, that such complections, shapes, and proportions, inseparably fore-shew: Sadnesse, I doubt not, both for her outward loueli∣nesse, and inward vertue and vse, will be allowed for an adornement,Sadnesse ador∣neth. that doth not alone please the eye, but the more iudiciall and intellectuall parts. First then, though I am not ignorant, these mer∣ry companions are the most acceptable to the most:
yet not alwayes to the best, and if they be at times welcome to the vnderstanding sort,Mirth not al∣wayes accepta∣ble to the best. they are receiued to their tables, not counsells: and vsed rather for sauce for their meate, then seasoning for their iudgements: and are, as was sayd of Athens, pla∣ces that though many desired to bee entertayned in, yet few to inhabite: from whence commeth this, but that as they are adorers of mirth, they are ha∣ters of all sadde and serious considerations  to keepe life in laughter, the whole stream  their wits is spent, vpon the motion of their tongues: In a word, they sacrifice their earnest to est, their friends to their humour, and to present satisfacti∣ons, all the duties of humanity, honesty, and dis∣cretion: and if so; where shall we lay hold of them, or to what vse would they serue, but to such a one, as all honest natures cannot but scorne and disdaine? vvhereas the sadde and sober behauiour makes it one way to allowances, and if it gets not acquain∣tances so fast, it winnes friends faster; and though perhaps it bee not alwayes so readily entertained, yet it is euermore respected: and reason, since the one with his incessant motion weares out it selfe, loades the eare, and loathes the eye; whereas the other, in his reseruednesse, maintaines his vnderstan∣ding, in his vnited vigor: and not troubling his braine with his tongue, falls not into the disaduan∣tages of many words: but still holding more in his brest then vpon his shoulders, is strong enough for any assault, and prepared to make the best vse of com∣pany and conference. Surely, if behauiour be of such estimation, as beauty without it is deformed; and deformity with it is louely, and agreeable to al eyes:
if behauiour be the soule of the forme, Sadnesse is the soule of the soule: for such a composed settled smoothnesse, as distastes not to day; pleaseth to morrow, and gets by continuance: no fashion wins so vniuersally and continually, as that which hath re∣ceiued the true tincture of Sadnesse, for it suppresseth the inconstancy, and busie turbulency of the passi∣ons and affections: it receiues nothing vpon trust, or at the first sight; and therefore is alwaies one: neither being troubled with the flouds and ebbes of for∣tune: the vanity of the world, the ill imployed pow∣er of greatnesse, nor the fluctuary motions of the humerous multitude; or at least, if he be sensible of their irregularities and confusions, yet his thoughts are not written in his face: his countenance is not significant: whereas the face and disposition of mirth euer resembles his last thoughts; and vpon euery touch, or taste of that which is displeasant, and fol∣lowes not the streame of his appetite, it deformes it selfe, and like the Moone, is in as many changes, as his fortune: now if the wrangling of children bee troublesome, the waywardnesse of men must, to a stranger, be ridiculous; and to the acquaintance odi∣ous: and consequently Sadnesse a goodly ornament, that neither displeaseth others, deformes it selfe, nor at any time passeth the bounds of iudgement and dis∣cretion; and though he must, as he is man, haue many thoughts to repent, yet few actions. Primum argumentum compositae mentis existimo, posse consistere & secum morari, as it is commonly taken for a signe of a strong estate, and a settled disposition, to keepe a certaine house, and to loue home: and that such men are the best, both comforters and counsellers,
of their meane and needy neighbours: so is it, with those minds that retire into their owne meditations, and scatter not themselues vpon the irresolute and inconstant inuitations of opinion; being most profi∣table in their examples; and most sound, in their counsels; outwardly goodly markes of direction, for them that are ignorant in their course: and with∣in, most happy and safe harbours and hauens for them, that either by weather, or weaknesse, or any other, either suspicion or knowledge of impediment, dare not put out into the vaste and profound muta∣bilities and dangers of this Ocean of the World: if now a mole on the cheek be an ornament to beauty; Sadnesse is the same to wit; and if wit, like quicksiluer, bee too nimble for it owne conseruation, Sadnesse doth more then containe it: for it refines, and fixes it: Iewels and rich apparell adorne the Possessor, and exact from strange eyes a reuerence and respect: Sadnesse, the graue and euer becomming robe of iudgement, represents to all vnderstandings the ve∣nerable account of all so adorned: if the all con∣cealing apparell of women, that measured by their modesty, leaues nothing for the incursions, of gree∣dy wanton eyes to make spoyle of, and doth not on∣ly proclaime their soules fairer then their bodies, but their bodies fairer then they are: with leauing the face, eye and hand, as a broken sentence to be per∣fected by imagination: Sadnesse doth the same; for the interiour parts doubling and redoubling the per∣fections of the mind, in such sort, that euen fooles that Nature hath euen hidden vnder this behauiour, haue often escaped censure; and vnder title of a hid∣den fellow hath hidden a most empty and senselesse:
for who can tell the contents of a clasped booke, or inuentory, or a lockt Wardrop? Now as it conceales the foole, it illustrates the wise man. For as the Sun breaking through a cloude, lets fall the golden tresses of his beames vpon the gloomy ayery mor∣ning, after his absence, with a much more resplen∣dent maiestie, then when continually vnmasked, he prostitutes his beauties vnto euery eye, and makes not onely the Shepheard, but his flocke weary of his company, and seeke shade and shelter to hide them∣selues from his too fast fixed sight: euen so the well wayed motions of the sad behauiour commands at∣tention, and the stayednes of his carriage prepares a consent before hearing, as due to him that lets no∣thing passe without due consideration. To conclude, if one of the greatest Philosophers determined silence, a more excellent quality then e∣loquence: I haue the ayd of his authority, since Sadnesse is the seate of silence, where shee onely re∣sides in safety, and where without all noyse, trouble or tumult, she enioyes the intelligence and contem∣plations of the soule: which the children of mirth cannot heare; for their owne noyse: nor taste, their mouthes are so furd with bodily pleasures. And now I will appeale to the eye, if these lignia∣ments and features of Sadnesse, be not more goodly and becomming then those of mirth: surely if they be not more delightfull, they are more contenting: the difference of which, I refer to the Iudiciall, and to those that valew things by their neerenesse, and resemblance of those of Heauen. Lastly, for gouernment, though the world be not made of Attomes, yet the body of mans reputation,
is the concurrence of his speeches, actions and pas∣sions: which ought to aduise all men, not to neglect the least motion, either of mind or body: lest it fa∣stens a deformity vpon all: shall we expect this from mirth? it were in vaine, and to prescribe it, were lost labour; it is composed wholly of contrarieties: for take a quantity of idle breath, sublimated into a iest, a proportion of laughter, some mimicke trickes, ei∣ther of the face or the body, and boyle them so tho∣rowly in wine, that you cannot know one from ano∣ther, and you haue the most receiued receit of mirth: but who will vndertake to giue assurance, that this in∣spired crue, shall not violate the dignity of men: and so gouerne themselues, that shame and derision shall not haue more right to them, then they to them∣selues? Vlisses dranke of Circes cuppe, and was not trans∣formed: the morall is, a wise man may wash his mouth, but not quench his thirst, with pleasure: for, he that aymes onely at mirth and pleasure, hits sor∣row and repentance; as well because it makes him rash and inconsiderate in his courses, when to buy mirth, he sells all the respects and duties that hee owes to inestimable vertue, and his owne preserua∣tion: as that it being to the mind, as a stoaue to the body, that so opens the pores, as the least ayre giues a blow to the health, so the least aduersity or frowne of fortune, deiects their minds, and layes them open, either to a rauening fury, or a base bewayling: wher∣fore he that will not seale the worst of sorrow, let him beware of deuoting himselfe to mirth, for they only feele the water intolerable cold, that goe into it ex∣traordinary hot. The Philosophers that imposed si∣lence
vpon their Schollers for their first instruction, could intend nothing else, but the settling and com∣posing the mind: from whence ariseth that habite of Sadnesse, that gaue them power of themselues; and withall of all things that came within the bounds of their knowledge: if not to gaine by, yet not to lose. To what end should I produce the witnesse of ma∣ny famous ancients, from whome scarce a smile was euer drawne, and yet were such, as neuer lost oppur∣tunity; that presented it selfe, to do others good, or themselues right: nor euer lost that power, force, and tranquillity of their owne minds, in any of For∣tunes transmutations, that is wont so to ouercome the reason of men, as like transformed creatures, there can bee nothing more different then them to them∣selues? Neither will I authorize my opinion, by the example of our blessed Sauiour, who was neuer seene to laugh: nor Salomons sacred counsell, that it was better to go to the house of mourning, then mirth, lest the worldly man, that makes prouision only for the building of his Babel, cast me off as an vnsea∣sonable and impertinent counsellor: though it shal then (gentle Reader) insensibly, and without thy trouble prepare thee for the best worke of thy life, which is the life eternall: yet whilest thou wilt be at∣tentiue to thy temporall imployments, it is also of most effectuall importance. Desirest thou to be reputed wise? It is her visiblest forme; not to bee importuned with vaine and idle cōpany? they feare Sadnes too much to follow thee. To bee the safe Cabinet of thy owne and thy friends secrets? Sadnesse is the parent of silence, si∣lence of secrecy.
To be temperate? where Sadnesse is Porter, few vaine desires are admitted. Not to bee precipitate in thy actions? Where Sadnesse keepes the lists of consideration, alwaies cleere and free, from the intrusions of passion, the soule cannot but gouerne all things by the regular and iudiciall power of reason, as shee that knowes time call to consultations, shuts out repentance. In a word, if there be any way to be troad in by our feete of clay, we are out of the reach of Fortune, out of the power of our passions, and in the full pos∣session of our selues, wee may liue in a continuall calme: where from the height of a cleere & impreg∣nable iudgement, wee may safely and insensibly be∣hold the world, by this time so farre vnder vs, as all such vaine desires, as had wont to make vs suiters and followers to her, haue lost sight of their inamo∣red obiects, it is by the way of Sadnesse: who doth not alone inrich vs by that it brings, but preserues vs so by keeping out all inordinate appetites, distem∣pered affections, and those humors of bloud and o∣pinion, who where they are fauoured, do vsually de∣stroy and expell, not onely all honest and vertuous actions, but euen the very thoughts that doe but seeme to be well affected. Thus haue I (good Reader) presented to thy ac∣quaintance the sweetest, and best conditioned com∣panion of the life of man, which if you will but be∣leeue vpon tryall, I desire no more: be not seduced by opinion, and thou maist bee as happie as this world can make thee: for though the outward pow∣er makes men great, yet is the inward, that makes men vertuous, and vertue onely that produceth a
happinesse, that can indure the test of all times and changes. Neither must I omit to answere them that would hide their base choice in the confusion of words, and so will haue their mirth to be ioy; but he is worse then blind that knowes them not a sunder, mirth be∣ing rather an apish vnquietnesse, then a solide con∣tentment: besides, it liues not of it selfe, it depends vpon fortune, vpon time, health, and many outward accidents; and liues but vpon borrowing, whereas ioy being as the shadow of vertue, or the effect of the inward and inseparable cause of a good life, is ne∣uer from home, neuer in a cloude, neuer subiect to alteration, alwayes one, and therefore not only al∣waies happie, but therefore happinesse it selfe: and yet to make the difference more apparant, behold their pictures drawne by two excellent Masters, res seuera est verum gaudium, which if Sadnesse resembles not more liuely then mirth, let your iudgement de∣termine, and now for mirth, I am sure this was made, it is so like her, risu inepto, res ineptior nulla est; if you define mirth without laughing, you speake of somewhat els, and leaue your errand behind you, but it hath been so often determined, that they are so farre from all one, as they are not so much as alike: as further to labour in so manifest a truth, will rather obscure, then inlighten it. I will then include this question in this definitiue sentence, falso de laetitia opinantur siquidem ab vtris{que} gaudio scilicet & natura, diuersa est, it hath not onely lost the challenge to ioy, but to nature; hee then that drew man within the compasse of animal risi∣bile, was rather a confessor to good companions,
then a wise suruey or of the little world of man. And now to conclude, if thou hast but Melan∣choly enough to suspend thy opinion, whatsoeuer thou art, thou hast me in the power of thy censure: I doubt not but you shall bee beholding to your iudgement, to free mee from the heresie of Para∣doxes. If some other thinke, that I haue restrained the li∣berty of man, in commending Sadnesse vnto him: let him know, I haue not determined it the end, but the way onely; an entry or passage, that of the o∣ther side, hath a world much more spacious and pleasant, then that of this side, comprehended by mirth: which is little, poore and transitory: if yet there be some that will bring this euidence for their libertie, Laetitia tuuenem, fraus decet tristis senem, it is but like a licence to eate flesh in Lent, for them that are weake and sickly; or like a lawe that prohibi∣ted all persons to weare gay clothes, and Iewels, but players and curtisans: which was then taken for a marke of scorne, not for a priuiledge of grace and aduantage: which if they shall please to take so too, they shall haue the lesse to answere for, and I shall neither haue lost my labour, nor their fauour: if not, I must yet challenge the allowance of the wisest, which are the oldest, who if they should yeeld to an extreme, would rather ratifie that Philosopher that euer wept, then this that tooke no more pittie of himselfe, and of the madnes of mankind, then to spend his life in laughter. FINIS.
THE PRAYSE OF the Emperour Iulian the APOSTATA: His Princely vertues, and finall Apostacie. I Dare not affirme him temperate, that shuns surfets; nor him graue, that despiseth lightnesse; nor him valiant, that loues to conuerse with danger: It is no precious thing, my opinion, and yet I am afraid to spend it: let Physici∣ans, a Gods name, be thought trim fellowes for de∣termining of the liues of men, as if they had come yesterday from the Fates; for my part, except I may haue leaue to passe through the inside of them, I can say nothing: for all these are no more a kin to Vertue, then basenesse may challenge of No∣bility, because their names sound alike: it being not Temperance, not grauity, not Fortitude; except the
cause that moues these effects, bee vertues. The World affoords not a more apt example then this Emperour, the Historie of whose life is full of so many excellent things, as hardly he that is a votary against the world, and hath nothing to thinke of, but keeping his vow, may equall him in all these outward apparances, that fauourable iudgements call the way to heauen; but in the depth of impiety; againe, not the most reprobate,His temperāce. comparable: yet was he so tem∣perate, as he neuer surfeted nor vometed oftner, then he was made Caesar, and that of cheese: in the pro∣uocations of the flesh none chaster,His chastity & thrift. no vnthrift of his treasure, and time, in publike sports, a common dis∣ease of greatnesse:Not giuen to pleasure. no lasciuious pleasure did rust and consume his time, so couetous was he of it, as the very nights he deuided into vpholding his body, the bettering his minde, the seruing his country; he needed not Alexanders ball of mettall to awake him, for the thinnesse of his dyet required not much sleep,His moderate dyet. whereas the other was a good fellow, and gaue his hot constitution leaue to leade him to banquets and quaffings.His valour. For his valour, aske all the Histories of his time, and you shall finde they make so great a noyse about no body: but all these helpe him not, so irre∣ligious a hart possest them, proceeding most of them out of his education, some from his nature, none from vertue: how iustly then may we suspect our o∣pinions of men that carry the forme of the exactest liues? Me thinkes it were well, if they were let alone vntill the next world: for it is to be doubted, whether praises be not like raine that increaseth weeds, as well as nourisheth the corne: for it begets Hypocrites, and for the truely vertuous, they neither care for it,
nor neede it: if all men were of my mind, they that are good, and they that neuer came neerer then a desire to be thought so; should shortly be discerned one from another: for his soft pacing, his graue at∣tire, and constant countenance, shall not worke a whit vpon me, no, not a speech well read, with the head and the fingers finely placed; no, not the na∣ming vice in choller, and putting off his Hatt when vertue is called; no, not the defying the World, nor challenging the combate of concupiscence: these are but words of course, but promises, but no∣thing: Promittas facito, quid enim promittere laedit? pollicitis diues, quilibetiesse potest: But this it is to write without the hope of gaining by a Mecaenas, or the am¦bition of method; my matter, my stile, hang disioin∣ted, and vnsemented, neither of them keepes their place, but gallops, and trots and ambles; the rea∣son, I neuer gaue Tully an houre for any of his Re∣thorike: I send not my words awooing, I care not, so they can get to their iournies end, though they can∣not caper, nor dance: there is a grace in the sound of words, but it is not mine, I giue my thoughts clothes sodainly, and so fit, that they may be vnderstood; but whether they be in fashion and wel shaped, is not my care: I am of too rude a nature to be so nice, and mine eares are so harsh, that I could neuer yet vnder∣stand the sweetnes of the sound of opinion; but to that I take in hand. First, let me not be condemned for my Subiect: he was an ill man, that was his losse, but this ill was on∣ly ill at the iourneyes end; for most of his actions were good here, and had been good for euer, if they had not serued an ill master: but at the worst, Vertue
is not so proud as not to extract what may bee made good, out of ill for there is a spirit in vice, that being cunningly drawne out, will serue euen the best: so ful it is of a quick and peircing vigour: he hath a poore Library to behold, that reades onely the good; let him turne ouer all, that desires to bee profound; let him earne Vertue with digging it out of vice, and he will keepe it the better: let him fetch it out of the en∣trals of ill, that will glory of his conquest; from those soft ministers of the mind, the Arts which make the soule read to the body, and make practice but a slight, through the minds foreknowledge. This Prince came to the managing Armes, not with such a people whose weakenesse was fit to nou∣rish a nouice, but with those fierce and warlike; yet was he victorious, and made those that were wont to be feared, feare: Qui alijs terrore esse consueuerat, ip∣sum sibi timere coegit: who allowes not of such an excellent beginning? When I heare of any great Souldier, I aske his age, when if old, it takes away mine admiration; for vpon a wise minority I looke with greatest affection: But here comes a priuy to∣ken to know intents by, Sed haec laus etiam miserrima ambitionis labe contaminata est, cum se Augustum salu∣tari voluit: so greedy are those minds that intend onely to serue their owne turne; no sooner haue they attained to an atchieuement commendable, but they enforce prayses out of the mouthes of men; they will swagger for titles and respect; yea, it becomes Lord, euen of themselues; for reason of more waight, that in another mans case should haue preuailed, with the eyes of ambition seemes dwarfish, weake, and little. That wise and warlike seruant to the king∣dome
of Spaine,The Duke of Alua. the Duke of Alua, hath much of his glory dusked, by an Historian, that relates theDon Antonio Prior of Crato, commonly called the King of Por¦tugall. Prior of Crato would haue come to a good com∣position: but hee would not heare of it, because it could not haue bin then said, he conquered Portugal with the sword: of such a valew were a few idle words, as his masters profit and his own truth were thought things meete to giue place to this wind, to this no∣thing: But behold how Fortune sometimes playes the same part that wisedome doth, and brings a suc∣cesfull end to false beginnings: Vnde bellum ciuile a∣trocissimum esset consecutum, nisi mors pene repentina constantium ante sustulisset: thus doth that blinde guide make arguments to ouerthrow iudgement: thus vpon the death of Alexander de medicis, Cosimo was inthroned, being scarce out of the downe of his childhood, without much paine or study, that had cost his predecessors much trouble, much care: so doth it please the diuine wisedome, to demonstrate to mortall eyes their impotency; for it is hee, there is no fortune, it is hee that makes those things that seeme to haue idle beginnings, proue profitable at the end. Both these examples, though in some things different, yet agree in the demonstrating: those things that wee vnderstand not, and therefore call chances, haue often as faire an end as things propo∣sed; which is the will of heauen to teach vs earth∣lings, that our purposes cannot go whither they are cōmanded, without his pleasure. At his Coronation,His Coronation. & after, he seemed modestly to mislike his greatnes, the common tricke of ambition, who still desires to seeme carelesse of what he chiefely thirsts after; if it be not so, it is as with vs all, that like those things
that are farthest off: hee vsed often to protest, Ni∣hil se amplius assecutum, quam vt occupatior interiret: a speech that, me thinkes, drawes the nature of his place liuely, and withall, the happinesse of his place; for there cannot be a more noble state, then that which perforce bids vs to bee industrious and busie; a more worthy businesse can there not bee, then the imployment of a Prince: hee feeles not death that dyeth thus, he hath other businesse, then to breed thoughts of terror; and for them that find greatnesse, and yet make death terrible, it comes from the abuse of their authority: for they truly v∣sing it, are vnsensible of smart, and feare not death, nor his worst countenance. After his possession of the Empire, hee inuaded Persia, drawne the more willingly, by a perswasion, that his body had gotten Alexander his soule, and should haue his successe. Good Lord, into what vn∣certaine and ridiculous imaginations are they led, that haue not the anchor-hold of Religion! Went it no further, then this, it were most precious, for it keepes our thoughts in good order, which otherwise would make vs all as wilde as mad-men: for we bred Monsters and mis-shapen things in our braine, which did not the conscience reduce into fashion (which conscience is the childe of Diuinity) wee should not touch one another for feare of breaking: but some∣time such a perswasion carrieth higher and hand∣somer then euer meant, inforcing imitation. I knew once a fellow, meane enough, and as meanly qualited, being sayd to be like a great man, began to ingender stirring thoughts, of spirit, of well doing, and, at the last, arriued at the pitch of an indiffe∣rent
worthy fellow; but within a while this must be cast off. It is not amisse at the first to giue children plummes for learning their lesson, but afterwards they must loue learning for knowledges sake, these for vertues. Of the happinesse of his perfections, and then of his imperfections: his temperanceHis temperance. carri∣ed with it a number of commodities; for besides health, it maintained the strength and viuacitie of his spirit, which the aboundance of eating and drink∣ing is wont to quench; at least kill: his sleeps were thereby lesse (the drowner of the spirits) being the image of death, the maker of the vnderstanding dull,His moderate sleepe. and senselesse: but the best quality is the cooling of lust, which banqueting and excesse is wont to kindle in the body, and the body to fire the minde; but this abstinence brings the other vnder, and curbes lust, which vsually melteth away, and so becom∣meth the maintainer of the life of man. His ex∣ample is not of the least consequence, the life of the Prince being the book of the subiect,The Princes ex∣ample, the sub∣iects booke. from which nothing may withdraw them: though his abundance may seeme to license him, and exempt them, they will take it for no answere,Prouidence of time and trea∣sure. nor in trueth is it suffici∣ent, for I thinke they were lent him to doe others good with, not himselfe hurt: prouident in spen∣ding his treasure, parcimonious of his time, both strengtheners of himselfe, for by the first, hee comes not to neede others, by the last not to com∣plaine of time, for they liue the shortest (though most yeeres) that mispend it: a lamentable thing, euen worse then mortality, for this death is worse then that: a great meanes of this, was the cu∣stome of delighting the people,His delighting the people. and of honouring
their gods with sundry publike sports; and what might be the reason besides ignorance, in the Roman State vpholding these, I can but ghesse; it might be with their Cōminalty, as with our little children, who if not feede with sports will growe wayward and crie, so ticklish are popular States, where it is but a step from the best to the worst, that if they bee not kept busie, they will mutiny and growe into mislikes; to doe well they must be appointed their very thoughts, with feeding them with light stuffe, farre from the matter. Wherefore, if in no other re∣spect,Monarchike gouernment best. the Monarchy is to be honoured as the Prince of gouernment, and especially those of succession, where the ambitious and rebellious nature hath not so much to worke vpon, the people being euer most affectionate to the bloud Royall, and God hauing ex∣presly prohibited the vsing violence to his Anointed: the secret meaning of these sports was best knowne to the Romanes, but of the diseases of them I haue noted.2. Diseases in the Romane sports. The first disease. 2. In the time of Nero, and both of them me thinkes likely to follow: The one of them was, when the Procurators, Proconsulls, or other Magi∣strates, had abused the authority of their places, with pilling and taxing the subiects of the Empire, they came to Rome and made their peace, with giuing the people the sight of sword-plaiers, or som such things. Here is the Prohibition: Edixit Caesar ne quis Ma∣gistratus, aut Procurator, qui Prouinciam obtinert spectaculum gladietorum, aut ferarum, aut quod aliud lu∣dicrum aederet; this is the medicine, the disease fol∣loweth: Nam ante non minus tali largitione, quam cor∣ripiendis pecunijs subiectos affligebant, dum quae libidine deliquerant, ambitu propugnant: It is a circumspection
most behouefull for the Magistrate, to take away the meanes of getting these keyes to open the peoples heart with, which is to be certainliest performed, with stopping all springs, that would feed them, but the fountaine of chiefe authority; for otherwise, they will like tame birds, readily come to the call of him that giues them meate. The other was,The second dis∣ease. how apt the celebrations were to nourish a lasciuious Prince, shewing & directing the way to softnesse, & excesse: which is well approued by this Empire of liberty and festiualls, and the ancient Laconian strictnesse, where there was neuer riotous Prince; in the other, euery second or third Emperour a Monster:Power in a wanton hand ruinates his charge. there is not a more dangerous thing then power in a wantō hand, which euery way ruinates his charge; for if it liue to growe olde, it becomes tyranny, in the meane time corrupts himself and Common-wealth: the naturall man louing bodily pleasures, when cherished by the life of a lasciuious Prince, the nature of it is doubled. Est vulgus cupiens voluptatum, & si eo Princeps trahat laetum: They are well contented with such a Gouer∣nour, alas, their countenances are vnfit guides for a States-man; me thinks they are like the sence of tast, that neuer considereth the operation, but taste: faire otherwise was this Prince, which he layes to his edu∣cation, though I think Nature had made him of too rough a mould to bee carried with such lightnesse; yet might it be his familiarity with letters, which car∣rieth the mind so high, as most other things appeare base and contemptible; this speech is the childe of such a minde, turpe esse sapienti, cum habeat animam, captare laudes ex corpore: it is a speech worthie of the worthiest mouth, and proclaimes to the ambitious
where to buy the best glory and commendations. It resteth to tell what were the waights that made his vicesHis vices. heauiest, the lightnesse of his nature, or incon∣stancy, his pursuite of vnlawfull knowledges, and lastly, his ambition and cueoting dominion. I doe not cry fie of inconstancy,First his incon∣stancy, &c. or curse it, for by the leaue of ages settlednesse, there is neuer a Pesant in the world traines vp youth better, I abhorre it in age, and stop my nose at it; but youths best lectures are read by inconstancy;Prayse of incon∣stancy in youth. neuer stampe, mistris experi∣ence, at my opinion, for were it not lawfull for age to forget, I should call you ingratefull, for Inconstancy was your nurse, and all the strange experiments you haue passed, she carried you through. But when age begins to decline a body, it is time to leaue it: hee hath spent his time ill, that knowes not then what to trust to, which knowne must be held to the death, yea and in death.Martyrdome one of the best deaths. Martyrdome is one of the best fashio∣ned cuts that Dame Atropos hath: me thinks, at that time Death playeth a gallant conductor, and leads vs to an assault that passed, deserues tryumph, his ill directed knowledges deserue the greatest blame, for all knowledges whatsoeuer that haue poysoned man,His ill deriued knowledge. with the perswasion of standing onely vpon his own strength, are both feeble and impious; they are like legges that haue onely strength to carry the body, where it may destroy it selfe: amongst these Magick and Astrologie,Magicke and Astrologie. the studies of vaine melancholicke natures,Diuell-binders. but especially the diuel-binders are the most sottish people in the world: for what can bee more ridiculous then to thinke hearbs, spels, and cir∣cles, can enforce infernall spirits to be ruled by mor∣tall men, or that God will giue a power to his Name
abused? But Astrologie is not so ill. The other Ma∣gicke, is the game that the diuell playes at fast and loose with man, but the abuse of knowledge, the dis∣ease of the finest metals, deserues more pitty; of all the great troupes that goe this way, I find few ar∣riued at an indifferent commendation; I cannot tel, they are cut off either by pride, vanity, or contempt; this is the cousenage of partiality; doe you thinke there is such an excellency in hauing slubbered an A∣ristotle? Fie, no. If you vnderstood Aristotle, you might be bettered; there is not such a vertue in genus and species, as you haue set it downe in your In∣uentory, they are but names; and Art it selfe but the stilts of a cripple: for if we could go without them, what should we do with them? Vanity, prides mi∣nority, belongeth to this crue: such are those that hauing taken a dosse of Cicero, presently learne their tongues to dance a Cinque-pace; these vtter Orati∣ons so like Ciceroes as they seeme the same, so well can they enforce a circumstance and neatly slide from one limme of Rethoricke to another: away with this whorish eloquence, with this breath-mar∣chandise, it becomes not the grauity of a professed scholler, no more then it doth a Generall, reckoned to be skilfull at his needle. The last is Pride in graine,His contempt of others. contempt; an humor sodden in selfe opinion, a dis∣ease killing the loue of his countrey, & countrymen, the perswasion to make him to apply the riches of his mind to the benefit of others, but this is taken away; for contempt and loue were neuer friends, and then he is no other then a buried Treasure:To know what contempt is. This disease is to bee knowne by separating his customes from the world, by an eye ful of disdain, by a countenance
borrowed from the picture of some old Philosopher: for no people am I more sorry, then for these, which abuse the picture of our first and most blessed state: they that desire cure, let them goe to Seneca, Frons nostra, populo conueniat, and after more thorowly, Id agamus, vt meliorem vitam sequamur quam vulgus, non vt contrariam: I am glad yet that Seneca's time was troubled with these inke-horne Bragards, as well as wee. His ambition.But this Emperours coueting dominion, of which I shall speake like one in a dreame, for I cannot think like a Prince, and I am glad of it, for they are thoughts too bigge for me, but as I ghesse, Ambiti∣on is more naturall and profitable, in a Prince then priuate men: for the definition of vtile & honestum with them, and vs, is not all one, our states and our professions differ, and all one instrument will not serue vs. IVLIANS Dialogue of the Caesars. His Dialogue of the Caesars.I Desire to haue the picture of famous men by mine eare not mine eye, I preferre the Historian, before the Painter, I get nothing by the fashion of his face, but by the knowledge of his life: the pen is the best pensell, which drawes the mind, the other, that tells you the stature and proportion of the body may delight, not profit; giue me therfore their works; if writers; if not, their liues written by others: thus thinke I of bookes (the issue of our minds) all which are not without some profit, for there is no soule altogether barren, but especially those that are able,
and doe write in earnest, those binde the whole world to them, for they dissolue their spirits, to make theirs more precious, and by the helpe of time haue made that excellent cordiall, that the soule disgesting may recouer, and bee preserued against our naturall dis∣ease ignorance. I sucked not long enough of my Schoole-master to proue a Commentor,The Authors di∣gression of him∣selfe. I cannot fetch words from their swadling bands, nor make them interpret the quality of the things knowne by them, I tract them not, nor set a brand of them when I meete them, nor compare the words of one Au∣thor with another: if I can make ioyning worke of the matter, I goe contented, for I worke not for words: and thus nature hath framed me, & I will not goe to surgery for an alteration; for me thinkes it be∣comes a gentle spirit well, to leaue the drosse and fly to the matter, he writes not vnder the hard restraint of feare or gaine, but gallantly giues the World the trauels of his minde, and it is gallantly, for a Merci∣nary liberallist is in little better state then a Renegado: let him then that courts his censurers with sweet titles for feare of bitternesse, or him that sends his booke of a voyage in hope of gaine, tend this cutting vp words and such stuffe: but he that writes so purely as to want these, let him run into things of worth, and fetch secrets out of the entrals of actions: I haue read History, but they seldome doe any more then make the times confesse; some vpon History, most simple, some better, others dangerous; but this Dialogue hath of the vertue of both, and little of their idlenes, full of excellent obseruation, and withal quick: so wel did the stomak of mine vnderstanding like it, that she boyled longer then ordinary, & here is the digestion.
It is not my maner to be busie about the maner of the feast, the place, nor other circumstances, let it suf∣fice the Author makes Romulus inuite his successours to a feast, at whose entrance Sylenus, Iupiters buffone hits them where they were left vnarmed by Vertue. I promise neither method nor antiquitie; but after my fashion thus:Iulius Caesars entrance. First Iulius Caesar enters, of whom Sylenus bids Iupiter beware, lest he plots his depo∣sing; for hee is (sayth hee) great and fayre; thus dangerous is the neighbour-hood of Ambition:Caesars ambition. for all other affections that are wont to maintaine ami∣ty are not here; for Ambition loues nothing but it selfe, nor pitties, nor regards: so both commen∣ding his reason and passion to bee slaues to this hu∣mour is good onely for that, to all other dangerous. Besides the humour, he had two instruments belong∣ing to it, he was great and faire; alas, what account should we make of our reason? since she suffereth the vainest occasions to beget the seriousest purpo∣ses. Is it not pitifull that Valour should be beholding to the Drumme and Trumpet, and flying of the co∣lours and the glittering of Armour? Yet is it, and I thinke few spirits, but amongst the rest haue found these the inflamer of courage: no lesse absurd is the election of a Magistrate by his beautie;Not good to e∣lect a Magi∣strate for his beauty. yet is it common for that Whorish affection to preuaile, the which rank'd with this greatnesse ouercomming suf∣ficiency, when men whose euidence lyeth in their titles; shall possesse places where wisedome is be∣houeful, & patrias laudes sentiat esse suas. Of al which there is to be noted the basenesse of our choyce, the sluggishnesse of our reason, for not forbidding the banes. And lastly, how they throw themselues into
the hands of Fortune, with managing these high things so basely. In the description of Octauius en∣trance,Octauius en∣trance. I note Poetries power, he makes him appeare in diuers colours, which, me thinks,His Poetry, and Policie. doth here more handsomely then the plaine truth: for it had not bin so fit to haue sayd, Policy sutes his forme like the oc∣casion, and alters as it alters: of him, Sylenus, Papae, quam varium hoc animal, such must be policy, for his trade is with the diuers dispositions of man, and ac∣cording to them must be diuers. Then Tiberius with a graue & cruel countenance,Tiberius en∣trance. who, he after paints full of scarres and scabbes, as te∣stimonies of his tyranny and intemperance, to whom Sylenus, Longe alius mihi nunc, quam ante videres:His tyranny and intemperance. But, me thinkes, his Verse is not rightly applyed, for Tyrants are euer deformed, mary, feare in their liues makes it inward, after their deaths apparant; thus pretily doth time mock mortality, first tying one par∣tie, and suffering the other to beate them, then the losed, tyed, and the tyed losed: thus tyranny and sub∣iection: tyranny as long as it lasts buffets his vnder∣lings, but death at last giues the loser a time of re∣uenge, when he woundeth their memories, with∣out feare or danger. After Silenus assaults his abominable life in the Iland Caprea, in no life doe the blemishes of life ap∣peare so visibly as in Princes, whose height and pow∣er, as it may do much, so is it most obserued. I won∣der hee lets him scape for Seianus, his doting vpon whom, was much more impardonable then the sim∣ple Claudius, because the former professed craft, the other alwaies gouerned by smocks and slaues. At Claudius entranceClaudius en∣trance. he repeats a Comedy, and
after complaines of Romulus, for suffering him to come without Nacissus,His committing his affaires to others. Palantus, and his wife Messa∣lina: thus it happens with them that beare the names of great places, and lay their execution vpon others: thus with them that are so tender hearted as to bee led by others: thus haue I often obserued seruile con∣ditions to vndermine their masters, there being great losse in granting to the will of intercessors, for the gift is theirs, the thanks anothers; wherefore it is the duty of discretiō to reserue to themselues the occasi∣on of importance, and he that giueth, to be vnknown himselfe to him that he giues. Now comes Nero and his harpe:Neroes entrance delighting with playing on the harpe. nothing is so fast tyed to vs as our faults, we are neuer mentioned without them, they hackney our names to death, and neuer leaue spur∣ring them till they haue killed them. This man, saith Silenus imitates Apollo, in the meane time behold his misshapen course, that destinated to an Empire, pursues the facultie of a Musician: I neuer see any that professe skill in many things: in these hie mat∣ters much lesse; one being inough for one: There followes a troupe together, though Vindex shewes the suppression of tyranny, is behouefull to the com∣mon-wealth,Galba. but dangerous to the party. Galba was euer too little or too big, for his fortune, beeing thought fit for an Empire whilest priuate, when an Emperour, vnworthy, and ended his slaues slaue. Otho.Otho might haue beene examined about the go∣uernment of Lucitania, whether hee possest not that, to be dispossessed of Popaea.Vitellius. For Vitellius let Iupiter looke his cheere bee good, or else his pallate will purse his host: Galba shewes the difference betweene opinion and tryall, and withall that there is no grea∣ter
enemy to praise then expectation: Otho, that it is not impossible to possesse great places for vilde causes: Vitellius that there is nothing that discouers a lasciuious mind so cleerely, as power and authority. VespasianVespasian. followes a Prince that Sylenus could finde no fault with, but it seemes, hee had not read Dion, who relates the time of his whores death:Giuen to wo∣men. heere is the oddes of beeing neere an Emperour, for a thousand better deseruing women died in those times without mention: he saith he delighted much in her, neither becomming his age, office, nor wise∣dome, but I find none without some ayle or other. It had been a good time for Sylenus, to haue asked this, what it was he repented him of, whether it were his louing his brothers wife to wed, or not, hating his brother inough, or else his fearing the people, more then louing Berenice. DomitianDomitian. His cruelty. had been bet∣ter for a butchers shop then a palace: for there it could hardly haue been sayd of him, Solus est, ne mus∣ca quidem cum eo: now TraianeTraiane. appeares, vpon whose sight,Giuen to drink. Sylenus giues Iupiter warning to looke to Gani∣medes: hee might also haue bidden him be carefull of his Nectar; for he loued his lector as wel as boies. The graue fellow following must be in Aurelius,Aurelius. ac∣cording to my gesse a fellow meeter to haue made a priuate man then a Prince,Too milde. one of his commendati∣ons was his sufferance: a good pretty prayse for a sub∣iect, but nothing fit for a Prince, he was also pitifull, a procurer of loue: but what of that, loue thus obtai∣ned, is too familiar a Vertue for an Emperour. Per∣tinax bought his regalitie at a deare rate, his grea∣test fault was his ill husbandry, for as trees in their first growth are defended by bryars, which after∣wards
vncut vp, ouerthrow the florishing of the tree; so an vnlawfull elected Prince, seldome escapes plu∣ling downe, by those that set him vp; for couetous∣nesse being the cause of their combination, nothing can serue their vnsatiable desires, nor be thought a sufficient recompence: aske Laetus els by the fortune of Plautianus. Here comes SeuerusSeuerus. a Prince of indif∣ferent worthinesse, had not his vertue suffered ship∣wracke by his affections,Too affectionate to his children. erant ei filii multo chariores quam ciues, which though a priuate man may con∣fesse, whose gouernment is but a houshold, it is a shame for a Prince, whose office as it resembles the gods in power, so should it in being free from partia∣lity.

Alas, for this poore fellow that followes; AlexanderAlexander. that dyed because he loued his Parents well; this is he that would giue any mony for quietnes,Giuen too much to peace. and made Oratours the supporters of his Empire. Debere vnumquem{que} suis fortunis acqui∣escere, a speech fit for a warme chamber, and no bu∣sinesse, questionlesse he sought not the Empire, but the Empire him: so doe the Fates or chance, or if you will, more high and certaine powers constitute ignorant men in high places, to distemper all, to giue after the more grace to the reorderer. There follows more, but I will not follow all, nor stand vpon the Authors Poetry, or by-speeches, I write vpon him, not him out, they that will haue it more orderly, were best goe thither for it.
Comparison betweene Alexander and Caesar. NOw to the comparison betweene Alexander and Caesar: Caesar loued a wench, as well as A∣lexander wine, both faults, but which most dangerous disputable, they both impaire the vnder∣standing, the one with laying too much vpon the head, the other with taking too much from the head: wine drownes reason, lust prefers his wench before the World: in wine Alexander killed Clytus, Caesar proclaimes loue letters in the Senate: both brea∣ches likely to waste authority, but which of them most dangerous, I leaue to the censurers, both of them doubtlesse full of danger, for they are the priuy gates, whereat Conspirators get entrance. More ear∣ly did Alexander begin to busie fame, but that was his fortune. Caesar more worthily, if not at last vnworthi∣ly; for, hee ouerthrew the hinderance of a meane state, and made way through the obscurity of his birth, which he confesseth difficult. Difficilius se prin∣cipem ciuitatis a primo ordine in secundum, quam a se∣cundo in nouissimum detrudi; how he did this deserues note: I find all his actions, euen his youngest, to be carried with great maiesty, and an intent to lay the foundation of a reuerend opinion of him in the harts of men; his behauiour amongst the Pirats was one, the refusing the friendship of Lepidus another, he be∣ing the author of restoring the Tribunes office: these for example, vpon which time will not suffer me to worke my will, the wise obseruer may for me, and gaine by it. Alexander was not idle in his childs age,
his managing Bucephalus, argued courage; his vse of Embassadors, wisedome; the denying to run without Kings, maiestie: but these were beautified with be∣ing the actions of a Prince, for they would not be∣come Caesar halfe so well, because a priuate man; that Caesar wept at the sight of Alexanders picture, is no aduantage, for he had the ods of him by birth: then both were happy, in not hauing the first growth of their indeuours, ouer-driped by men already great; Greece at this time, not hauing any great Souldier. Caesar in his first Consulship, being matched with a heauy fellow, that not able to keep way with his swift∣nesse, and strength of his spirit, gaue him leaue to manage all matters alone, whereupon his two names serued for the names of both the Consuls, Nonnulli vrbanorū cum quid per iocum testandi gratia signarent, non Caesare & Bibulo, sed Iulio & Caesare Consule actum scriberent: they tried how the world would like their authorities, by two different meanes. Alexander an absolute Prince inuaded Greece, by which hee made them vnderstand that his youth deserued not con∣tempt, and brought them to be assistants in the wars against Persia. Caesar lower, but no lesse politikely, he tooke the occasion of his daughters death, and in an office of affection presented the people with plea∣sures and nouelties: munus populo aepulum{que} pronuntia∣uit in filiae memoriam, quod ante eum nemo fecit; this was a taste of their likings, a loue letter of an Amorist, which if taken, more wil be taken: Caesar seems in the difficulty of their conquests the worthier, no nation of Alexanders being comparable, either to the Gaules or Heluetians, but in the vpshot alike, both the Persi∣an & Pompey being greater in reputation then truth:
they did well, as long as they went with the tyde: it was the generation long before spent, that made the Persian diademe shine with Imperiall title, the vi∣gor of necessity, that is wont to moue magnanimity, was taken away, and now left an ouerflowing of for∣tune, which makes men degenerate and become slothfull. Pompey became great by the trauels of Lu∣cullus and others; neither his managing the ciuil wars was as it should be, nor his aduersity rightly mana∣ged; so that, me thinks, beholding him, I behold no∣thing but a bubble of fortunes: for their particular valours, they were both valiant, in their military disci∣pline, they differed, which might be by the difference of their aduersaries, nature and country: in the spe∣ciall point of Armes they agreed, to encounter the hearts of men, as well as bodies. Therfore did Alex∣ander deny Parmenio the inuading his enemies by night, answering the conquests of their hearts gene∣rally, not of a particular army was the way: the Em∣pire of Persia being aboundant in men, could neuer haue bin ouercome, if their discourse could haue laid the Macedonian cōquests vpon any accident, but then vanquished, when feare should make them superstiti∣ously adde, to the valour of their enemies, and think basely of their owne strengths: not thus, but to the same purpose, Caesar neuer misliked the multitude of his enemies, difficulty being euer a spurre to his acti∣ons. That humor that Caesar possest his Souldiers with, at the scorning life at the hands of Caesars ene∣mies, I find not in Alexanders, yet had he one of the chiefe instigators, the being stil a Conqueror; for had Caesar sometimes lost, they would haue growne wea∣ry. This branch came first from the root of successe,
seconded by some gallant spirits of Caesars side, emu∣lated by their followers, rewarded by Caesar; both held the hearts of the souldiers by liberality, the onely meanes to make them apt for great matters, and his meanes that attempts great matters, that which wee call the common good, this is a chiefe limbe of, the ingrossing which alienates the harts of subiects more then any thing, and with those natures that must feele the effects of vertue, with their hand: no doubt libe∣rality makes them daring, the contrary, Cowards: Alexander maintained this honestest, thankes to his Patrimony: for a spirit that aimes at so great matters, cannot determine those things dishonest that are any thing auaileable. Suetonius sayth of Caesar, Vrbes diru∣it saepius ob praedam quam delictum, an impardonable fault, for though fury, smart, or rapine may carry the common Souldier past the bounds of reason; yet should the Generals minde be still one, and behold nothing with so much loue as iustice, but this was the violence of Ambition, who dares displease right, then her assistants. Caesar, after his victories, vsed to giue his souldiers an accustomed liberty, a president for all the successe dangerous, for of all rewards and incouragements, libertie is the most dangerous to the giuer. Contrariwise, Alexander then curbed his Souldiers, doubting insolency, the destinate disease of successe, which he did by giuing education to the Persian youth, and after imploying them, a designe full of wisedome, for his conquests hauing layd all things at her feete, they had no need of his directi∣on, but hee of their loyalties, which had they found, and found before his possession of other strengths, doubtlesse they would haue made him their slaue,
that counted himselfe Monarch of the World: but this I find it discōmodious, to rely vpon one assistant, for two are not so likely to fayle as one; and to say truth, both will be the more true, because they are two. Equally did they subiect their bodies to rayse their reputations, they knew the force of example, and re∣strayned appetite for honours sake. Alexander would not adde to the thirst of his companions, with the quenching of his owne. Caesar in a straight lodging gaue his friends the house, and lay himself in the ayre; I cannot say in the cold, for he that is wrapt in the fie∣ry thoughts of ambition, cannot feele heate nor cold, nor any of these distemperatures: it is idlenesse that betraies vs to the opinion of aches and infirmities; for he that imploies his minde, carrieth his body about without feeling the burthen: the vse of these is an ex∣cellent remedy against enuy, meane fortunes thinking greatnesse, loues greatnesse to nourish delicacy; but this is disproued by partaking with their extremities. Both intertained a sweetnesse of nature in bewayling the misery or death of their enemies, which, whether it came from the grounds of clemency, or otherwise to wrap some other purpose in, is hardly to be discer∣ned, for there is no such counterfaiter to the life, as an aspiring disposition: Thus Caesar sate vp the statues of Silla and Pompey; thus Alexander kindly and honestly entertained the wife and mother of Darius: Caesar took to mercy the relikes of Pompeys ouerthrowne Army: Alexander suffered the mother of Darius to solemnize the burials of his slaine enemies, which compassion is the onely balme to heale vp the wound of reuenge. Lastly, Caesar wept at the sight of Pompeys head: and Alexander sharply executed the murtherer of Darius;
In the first, I see how pretily dissimulation can apply her selfe sometimes; for surely Caesar felt no remorse in the hardnesse of his labours, such thoughts attend decay'd estates, not the summer of fortune. In the o∣ther, one death serues two turnes, for death rewarded him, and death mitigated the rancor, likely to spring out of the ashes of Darius. About conspiracies, Alex∣ander spake as Caesar thought, Satius est, alieno me mori scelere, quam metu meo, they might haue liued longer, if they had been of another minde; yet I thinke they chose well, for they chose the easiest: for feare runnes diuision vpon death, euery thought being an instru∣ment of torment, at the end they meete in the last course of greatnesse: Alexander was a King, and would needs be a god: Caesar, because not a King, a King; thus doe the baits of fortune coozen vs, and stuffe vs with monstrous and vnnatural thoughts; they dyed both violent deaths, the end of violent ambiti∣on: for who mislikes not that one should possesse so much of honour, fame and dominion as would serue many? Octauius comes againe, whose beginning to speake, resembles his life, busie in the separating enuy and greatnesse, which he did by giuing euery state a taste of his gouernment: by turnes they felt it all, euen the meanest and youngest, the surest strengthener of au∣thority: only this Prince gaue occasion leaue to chuse, which was to be entertained of peace or warres: an excellent temper, the which many of his Predeces∣sors and Successors had lost by, whiles they regarded not which was most fit for their Countries, but which was most fitting their natures: it were too long to touch all the particulars of his life; let it suffice, they
all tended to settle the troubled estate of his time, the testimonies of dishonour that the Romanes suffered vnder Crassus and Anthonie, by the hands of the Par∣thians, he solued, as much as the restoring the mili∣tary ornaments, arested by the Victors might, which witnesseth wisedome is a more preuailing assister then strength; hee enforced all the Knights of Rome, to yeeld an account of their liues, an ordinance, looke on which side you will, full of health, for idlenesse brings barrennesse; his Epistle to his adopted sonne illu∣strates another lmbe of his wisedome: Noli in hac re nimium indignari, quenquam esse qui de me male loqua∣tur, &c. These ill speakers are rather troublesome then dangerous, an humour arising rather out of some light passion or wanton gadding of the tongue, then from malice; who is more silent, more full of poyson; ouer those care, but ouer the other, neglect is the best medicine: he refused the name of Dictator, though his authority farre exceeded it, the onely course to make greatnesse stand firmely; for by the common eye, names are more plainely seene, then executions, which silently enioy a more ample and safe rule, then those that make their titles march before their power. Our Dialoguist omits some, and I some. Traiane speakes next, a Prince full of merits; espe∣cially in his warlike actions, but me thinkes it was to the same end, that he made warre vpon a Country: sed reuera id bellum suscepit adductus gloriae cupiditate; it often falls out thus, and as often that our dispositi∣ons without any great paines giue vs pretty graces: therefore say I, a young man not couetous, and an olde man no lecher, deserues neither thanks nor mar∣uell, but their exchange doth well, come they from
what cause they will, they are well; he was an excel∣lent Prince, and that title his subiects gaue him, opti∣mus cognominatus est, he deserued it for he abstained as much from depriuing his subiects frō their goods, as from vnlawfull slaughters, both the one and the o∣ther, the maine vertues of a Prince, for to pill them, is no lesse horrible, then the tutor of an Infant to betray his charge, the other is bloudy, which though their ielosies thinke the way of freedome, they are decei∣ued; for an vniust death raiseth tenne enemies out of one: Non ei vnquam accidit (quod uenire in huiusmodi solet) vt millites feroces se & insolentes praebuerint, as great a praise as memory can giue a Commander; for nothing is so sure an euidence of a wise man, as to bring his souldiers to fetch all their determinations from him, and not to let them entertaine insolency, when victors; nor basenesse, when vanquished; but still to reade his will, and to hold that will a lawe: hee carefully visited the wounded, honourably buried the dead, marched on foote with them, suffered part of their extremities. I like this better then the saluting them commilitones: suffer with them, giue them, care for them; but no fellowes, nor companions; these words kill all the actions of greatnesse, of commise∣ration, of pitie, with contempt; for neuer can one man play two parts well, you cannot bee their Iudge and companion; for this equality taketh away the re∣gard of your sentence: loue them, but doe not play with them. Marcus enters, a slowe wise fellow, whose opinion was; non decere Imperatorem, propere quicquam agere: I like consideration well, but not to sticke fast vpon a designe; sure he was naturally a dull flegmaticke fel∣low;
and so was honest whether he would or no, he sayth little in this Dialogue, and little is sayd to him; but only he was a wise man, because he knew when to speake, and when to hold his peace, which is wis∣dome, but the lowest forme of wisedome: for the highest is, when to doe and not to doe. Post hunc Constantium vt diceret, admonuerunt; vnder this Prince things of note were done; but not by him: thus search the diuine natures into mens actions, the strength of whose sight, is neither to be deceiued, nor corrupted; he rooted out two Tyrants, not hee but himselfe the first, being weake and slothfull, two diseases that make the thus diseased, vncapable of great matters; the other, being the impediment of fortune, had the impediment of age, a heauy clogge and the opposite to expedition: both of them had both the mislike of God and men, and would haue ruined themselues without helpe: he was subiect to delicacy and luxury, which being vices vncounter∣uailed with vertue, made him reiected of the gods, and banished into the orbe of the Moone: the Au∣thor thinkes he enforced not enough how behoue∣full these warres were to the world, rooting out Ty∣rants, (the curse of mankinde) where Caesar and o∣thers made their ambition destroy their Country∣men, and subuert their Common-wealths; the rest, or at least many of them, picking quarrels with their neighbours to feed their owne insatiable appetite: Si quis sinus obditus vltra, si qua foret tellus quae fuluum mittere aurum, hostis erat; but others faults mend not his, and perhaps it was his enemies that made his quarrell good, for be they neuer so worthy, am∣bitious Princes will finde causes to be troublesome.
