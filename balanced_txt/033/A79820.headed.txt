THE CITY. DRaw neere you factious Citizens, prepare To heare from me, what hideous fooles you are, What lumps of sordid earth; in which we finde Not any least resemblance of a minde Ʋnlesse to basenesse, and Rebellion bent, Against the King to ayd the Parliament. That Parliament whose insolence will undoe Your Cities wealth, your lives and safeties too. Are you so stupid dull you cannot see How your best virtues, now are treachery: Apparent treason Murther, and the like, How with unhallowed hands you strive to strike Him whom you should your Loyalty afford (Great CHARLES) the blest anoynted of the Lord; How you do daily contribute and pay Money, your truths and honors to betray. Bigge with fanaticke thoughts, and wild desire, 'I is you that blew up the increasing fire Of foule Rebellion, you that only bring Armies into the field against your King, For were't not for supportment from your bags, That great and highest Court that onely brags Of your vaine folly, long e're this had bin Punnished for their bold sacrilegious sine Of actuall treason, there had never come Ʋpon this Kingdome such a Martirdom. Armes had hang'd up as uselesse, and the State Retain'd its freedom, had you kept your Plate: No Keinton Battailes had made Mothers curse, Made childlesse there the treason of your Purse, The Publicke purse o'th City, which must be Esteem'd the cause o'th publicke misery. No Drums had frighted silken Peace from out The Neighbouring Countries, nor neede you about Your City with your guilded Musket goe, Trayning not for good service, but for show, That the whole towne may see your fethers spred Over your Hatts, as the Hornes do o're your Head, The Humble Parliament had never dar'd To have prescrib'd Lawes to their King but spar'd Their Zeale in bringing Innovations and Distractions, o're the butious face o'th Land. They would not then have so supreamely brought Their Votes, to bring the Kingdoms peace to nought. Nor with so slight a value lookt on him King Charles, and only doted on King Pim, Nor for Authenticke Doctrine have allow'd As Law, the precepts of ingenious Stroud, Hambden, nor Martin, had not then lookt bigg Vpon their King, nor Arthur Haslerigge; Nor yet Kimbolton, on whom we now conferre The stile of trayterous Earle of Manchester: Secur'd by you the patrons of the cause Contemn'd his Loyallty, and the Kingdoms Lawes Nor misled Essex, had not you beene, nere Had acted on this Kingdoms theater So many tragedyes, nor Warwicke sought To ingrosse the Navall honors, no nor thought Vpon any action, so unjust unmeete As keeping from his Majesty his Fleete. Tis you have done all this, y'ave been the head, The very spring, from whence this River spread The streames of foule Rebellion, which we knows At last will drown'd you with it's overflow. You the arch traytors are, you those that stew The Kingdoms happinesse, and the aleagance du To his sacred Majesty, you you that have Betrayd this Nations honour to the grave Of lasting obloquye, you that have destroyed The smiling wealth of th' Ciy, and made voyd The good opinion which the King before Had of your Loyaltyes, of the faith you bore To'th Royall steeme, which still has to your great Advantage made this City their Chiefe Seate, Fond and and seditious fooles, do you thinke you be Wiser then all times numerous progenye, That have adorn'd your City, when did they Your harmelesse ancesters strive to give away Their wealth. and duty from their Soveraine Lord, To make themselves Traytors upon Record, When did they their Plate and Coyne bring in, To be the cause of their owne running ruining, They never vs'd to fright their King, nor draw Tumults together to affront the Law, No nor good houses, their Corslets slept and all The Armes they vs'd hung up in each mans hall, They did not then Ennamel'd Muskets carry, To trayne in More fields, and at Finsbury, But did in comely Archery Excell, Like honest grave Children of Adam Bell And Climme o'th Clough, now each of you will be, More then a furious William Cloudes-ee. And trace the Streets with teror as if Ven, With Fulk, and Manwaring, were the onely men Whome you did owe allegience to, as if they Could give you priviledg to disobey. The Royall Mandate, which doe's them Proclaime, Guilty of Treason, and you of the same, As deeply stand Impeach't, and will at last Pay derely for't, when your vaine hopes are past All Succors, which you credit for your merit, will be afforded you by the helpe o'th spirit, That is the devill you serve, for heavenly powers Can never Patronize such acts as yours, Poore basled City, but bafled by a crue Of men, which are as arrant fooles as you, Surely your braines can never be so dull As not conceive this, which each empty Skull Must needs resent, how that their onely ayme, Is to create your City all on flame, And as the smoake and sparkes up aspire, They'le sit and Laugh like Nero at the fire, Themselves have made, vnlesse your heads be all Hornes and no flesh, you needs must see the fall: That threatens you, like Lightening to Eschue, VVhich Ruine 'twould be wisedome to renue, Your lost alleagiance, and Repentance bring, As a fresh victim, to appease your King, For be assured who to the King's untrue, Must in their nature needs be false to you.
