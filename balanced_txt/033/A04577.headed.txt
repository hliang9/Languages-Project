ESSAIES, OR Rather Imperfect Offers, BY ROB. IOHNSON Gent. Seene and allowed. LONDON Printed by Iohn Windet, for Iohn Barnes. 1601.
Essay. 1. OF GREAT∣nes of mind. GReatenes of Minde is an ornament to ver∣tue, setting it forth in an higher degree of excellency, teaching vs to contemne all these imaginate worldly greatnesses, and confirming vs with a puissant resolution to en∣ter vppon the bracest enterprises: where this aptnesse is wanting, the vertues which specially befitte great fortunes (as depth of wisedome,
height of courage and liberality) are also wanting, and it is as impossible to enlarge a little minde to any of these vertues, as with the puffe of the mouth to force a tall vessell a∣gainst a strong and deepe streame. For how can they bee carried to embrace worthy deedes, who so highly prize this interim of life, how can they bee wise, who distracted with vaine feares, doe not settle in this resolution, that all worldly hap∣pinesse hath his being onely by opi∣nion▪ how can they be liberal, whose mindes confined to the world, think of liuing continually? Contrariwise, where learning hath gotten such a disposition to worke vppon, it is most powerfull, and can plant an opinion against the strongest feare of death. Then a man is easily induced not to esteeme the giftes of Fortune for their specious shew (for that were to admire them) but for their vse, and that is to go∣uerne them. t teacheth that it is a better thing to giue then to receiue:
Illud enim est superatis, hoc ver eius qui superatur, the one being the in∣signe of superioritie, the other the sgnifying note of subiection, argu∣ing a defect with acknowledgement of a better. And indeede greate minds cannot endure to make shew of a beholdingnes They loue their own benefites, and it is better by cō∣memoration of former fauoures to drawe them to accomplish our de∣sires, then by mentioning those good good turns, which proceeding from vs to them, might in reason binde a granting our petitions: for by so do∣ing they thinke Destrui fortunam suā and interprete it to a diminution of their greatnes, and disabling them of abilitie to requite: and when the be∣nefites are greater then hope of re∣compence, in lieu of a gratefull ac∣ceptance, they are repayed with a most malitious ill will▪ for there is no worse & more dangerous hatred then the shame and inward guilt of an abused benefite With those men the most pre∣uailing
manner of intercession is to giue thankes, as in Traians time the best Phrase of suting for offices was to shew that hee had beene lately in∣dowed with one: Optimé magistra∣tus magistratu, honore honos peri∣tur. These mindes with a noble despi∣singnes, ouerpassing small matters, contend for an excesse of estimation reseruing and husbanding their prowesse for the greatest employ∣mentes, AEnaeas in the Poet. -solum densa in caligine Turnū Vestigat lustrans: Solum in certami∣na poscit. Neyther can I more fitly com∣pare them, then to those noble dogs; which presented to Alexander by the king of Albanie, would not stirre at small beastes, but with an ouerflow∣ing of courage contemned to in∣counter but with Lyons and Ele∣phantes. They are spare in speech, open in action, euer musing and retired, such as Scipio is described by Cicero,
and Sylla (by the most cunning sear∣cher of mens minds) Salust in whom hee sayeth: there was an incredible height of spirite in concealing his courses. They are neyther proudly conceited in prosperity, nor discou∣raged with the stormes of aduersity, no way impeachable or subiected to the base dominion of Fortune. Such was Furius Camillus, who being al∣way like himselfe, neyther by attai∣ning the Dictatorship, was enflamed to haughtines, nor by being forbid∣den his countrie, was strooken into melancholie: and surelie in this ver∣tue the Romains were generally ad∣mirable, who neither in their con∣quering age were puffed vp to inso¦lēcy, nor in their crosse & vnlooked for accidentes stooped to dispaire. As in the disaster at Cannae, (when all the worlde did ring out peales, that their fortunes were dead) they did nothing vnworthy themselues, that might bee a derogation to the auncient dignity of their name: for being driuen to that exigent, that
hauing lost the flower and strength of their nations, they armed their seruantes and aged men to the bat∣tell, yet they neuer offered any ca∣pitulations for a truce, neyther wold they redeeme their captiues, both which actions imported an inuin∣cible confidence: and afterward in the enterprise of Asia, they propo∣sed before the victorie conditions to Antiochus, as i they had ouercome, and after the conquest out of a won∣derful moderation, as if they had not vanquished. But little mindes hauing risen with a prosperous winde, are lifted vppe farre beyond the leuell of their owne discourse: Then they beginne to speake in a commaunding accent to condemne other mens actions, to affect singularitie, to vsurpe vn∣due authorities, to contrauert in ar∣gument without respect, and to per∣seuere with an vnflexible stubborn∣nes, perswaded that al things becom them, and thus drunken with vaine greatnes, founded vppon no wor∣thinesse
are easilie trayned into opi∣nion, that their state was atchieued by their vertue, and that their ver∣tue was worthy of a better state. But when they beginne to taste any disfauour, presently discountenan∣ced in themselues, they are eyther by seldome comfortlesse flatterers, brought to some vnreasonable pur∣pose (as Claudius blinded with the false informatiōs of Pallas to adopt Nero) or else hauing no greatnes but outwarde, and standing on no true ground inwardly, are more ready to fall then calamity can depresse them, and presentlie like vile and abiect creatures, not aduenturing to reco∣uer, dispaire of renuing, and reinte∣grating their fortunes. But as the best wine becom∣meth the egrest vinegar, and what degree of goodnesse a thing holdeth while it abideth in his nature, the same degree of euill it taketh, when it is abused: So this greatnesse of mind, if it be not accompanied with vertue, maketh men daungerouslie
bad & terrible, producing the same effectes, which it did in Catiline, Im∣moderata, incredibilia, nimis alta sē∣per cupiendo: but being guided by clearenesse of iudgement, causeth men to bee soly earnest for the pub∣lique good, not to bee contentious, self-seeking, or any thing respecting their peculiar aduantages. Essay. 2, Of Wit. MEN of slowe capacitie, are more apte to serue, then to rule, their conceite is so tough, that neither the rules of lear∣ning, nor precepts of wisedome▪ nor habite of vertue can make any im∣pression.
Tardis mentibus virtus nō committitur, sayeth Cicero. They haue a dulnes enemie to wisedom, a slow∣nes hurtfull to the moments of oc∣casion, a certaine vnderstanding al∣waye faught with suspition, the lesse they perceiue, the more they conceiue, (for the selfe-guiltines of their owne defectes makes them willing to appeare curious) rather following chance, then doing any thing vpon free election: they faile in that greatnes of minde, that no∣blenes in their ends, that reason to resolue, that spirite to execute, that feeling of disgraces, which a man ought to haue. Some in the choice of Mini∣sters, elect men of this disposition, contemptu magis, quam gratia, who stand so farre good, as a simple void∣nes of euill serueth them for a groūd of fidelitie: but I cannot see how to allow this opinion, since wee ought to preferre those which are good, and know why they are good, when againe these simple wittes are
easily both altered and deceyued. A Witte too pregnant and sharpe is not good: It is like a rasor whose edge the keener it is, the sooner it is rebated, or like soft wood which is readie to receiue the impression of the Limner, but for warping is vna∣ble to keepe, and therefore not fitte for any worthie portraiture.. Men of this disposition are of a more quicke then sound conceite, hauing store of thoughtes rather stirred the disgested, in all their actions vnstay∣ed and fickle, one while embracing an opinion, as seeming the best, then againe looking more nearelie, and not able to aunswere the doubtes, which are readie to enter an open in∣uention, fall to a straing kind of vn∣certaintie: the more thinking, the more not knowing what to thinke, verie irresolue where there is some probabilitie to breede on both sides coniecturall likelihoodes: For a wor∣king and craftie witte drawes com∣monlie with it a doubtfull and wa∣uering iudgement: Such was no∣ted
in Tiberius stirring vp trifling re∣gards to containe him in suspence, rather increasing new doubts, then giuing any grounde to settle an opi∣nion, being the true cause, why his speech was commonlie obscurelie doubtfull, subiect to a double inter∣pretation, dissolued in it selfe, and not knit to any constant end. Such was Clement the seuenth, who ha∣uing a pregnant witte, and a deepe knowledge in all the affaires of the worlde, yet comming to pointes of execution, was verie vnfortunatelie irresolute, readie to reduce the rea∣sons into discourse, which first mo∣ued him to any deseigne. In Negotiations they deeme that of other mens proceeding, which in their owne case they would do, and in this securitie are oftentimes so o∣uerreached by their aduersarie, that they cannot returne without greate disaduantage and losse: Common∣lie they follow rather subtle then wise counsailes, which for the most part doe not speed: they are priae
specie laeta, thinges of apparance, and no substance, rather great and mag∣nificent, then easie and secure, they are Tractu dura, and by how much the subtletie is the greater, by so much it is necessarie, that the hand∣ling be verie precise, or else they wil sort to no end, being like the clocke which most artificiously composed, is soonest disordered, and put out of frame, they are Euentu tristia, most odious to the world, & so disfauou∣red of God, that they are alway wai∣ted on with most vnprosperous ends The same of crafte is alway hatefull, and procureth enemies, and these cunning companions are of opinion that they can dispose the whole world at their pleasure, and I thinke this imperfection hath some simili∣tude with that arrogancie of the Stoikes, which maketh men busie-headed and turbulent, desirous to be set a worke. Againe, quicke wits are readie in speech, but affected, high-flying Poets, but seldome Graue Orators,
commonlie betaking themselues to an humorous kinde of iesting, to play vpon any thing, and stirre the spleene, rather finding causes why a thing should be amisse, then willing to amende. And therefore wit doth in some respect resemble the Sunne, which so long as his beames wander abroad according to their naturall libertie, doth gently warme the earth, but when they are by a violent vnion as∣sembled in the holow of a burning Glasse, consumeth that which ought to be refreshed: so Witte the lampe of mans little world, indewed with a sensible volubilitie, gouerneth our actions according to our desire: but being armed with vehement & working spirits becommeth the trai∣tor of our blessednes, and therefore griefe is saide to bee the touchstone of the finest wit. To close vp this discourse, I ap∣proue a quiet discourse of reason: It is ordinarilie in a sanguine com∣plexion, which is so tempered
with a measure of melancholie, that the sodaine motions and enforce∣ments of the blood be allayed. These men are of a statelie presence, sound bodie, long life, readie to inuent, firme of memorie, copious to dilate, silent in tongue, secret of heart, de∣terminate in aduise, regular in pro∣ceeding, wise in seeing the best, iust in performing it, temperant in abstai¦ning from the contrarie. They are actu otiosi simillimi they dispatch their buisines with such moderation. Such a wit will euen in the execu∣tion perceiue, and vpon present oc∣casion determine, and take counsell, as fencers do in the listes, whom the countenance of the aduersarie, the bending of his bodie, the mouing of his handes doth admonish, how to proportion the distance, how to of∣fend where is lest warde, how to de∣fend where is strongest assault.
Essay. 3. Of Education. EDucation is a good and continuall manuring of the mind, the principall foundation of all humain happinesse, and as the soule is the formall cause of our life: so this is the efficient of a good life, giuing light to the vnderstanding to know Good, and make differene from the contrarie: confinement to the will soly to performe it, restraint to the growing affections, gouernment in actions, ablenes to the bodie, with∣out which, men are burdens and eye sores to the common weale, nothing
but a number. -Et fruges consumere nati. Honest companie is like an wholesome aire, a man may profite much euen by the chanceable enter∣view of a good man, and hee that ap∣plieth himselfe to the conuersation of the wicked, is subiected to the cō∣tagion of their vices: but especially it is a thing of great consequence in young mindes, which are pliable & apt to be seasoned, eyther with vertu∣ous or wicked resolutions, and to re∣ceiue the impression of any customs which their first companie (a warrant for common errors) shall by the si∣lent perswasions of their proper acti∣ons impose vpon them. This is the reason why the quali∣ties of the mind do commonlie run on a blood, & become hereditarie, insomuch that some families retaine proper customs naturalized in them. As in Rome the Pisoes were frugall: the Metelli religious: the App am∣bitious, the Manli austere, the Laeli wise, the Publicolae courteous, which
qualities, proceeded not from the difference in temperaur, (for that doth varie by interchangeable mari∣ages) but of the diuersnes of breed, which I may properlie call a second, and better nature. In restrayning the humors which may feede vices in youth, it is not good to aggrauate smal errors with termes of affected indignation: for it is a daungerous thing to vse a me∣dicine stronger then the nature of the disease & complexion of the pa∣tient. The best course and of most efficacy in disposing generous minds is with reprehensions to mixe pray∣ses: imitating wise commaunders, who seeing their souldiers dismayed do not vpbaid them with the name of cowardice, but by recording their honourable seruices, enflame them to imitate and surpasse them∣selues. The forme is in the Poet: O Achilles where is that valour which hath filed the world with your fame: doubtles you forget your selfe in o∣uerthrowing all the excellent things
you haue done, and distaining them with so shamefull a retirednes Thus hauing awaked him out of his sleepe of idlenes, he telleth him, Tibise pe∣ritura reseruant Pergama, and so ma∣keth demonstration how he may ho∣norablie redeeme the alreadie con∣ceiued infamies. For as euill eyes, although they they can see there is a Sunne, yet through weakenes cannot delight in the Sunne: so a mind ouerweighed with the violence of passions, hardly admitteth that freenesse of speech, which reason might warrant, but re∣quireth such a Phisition, who can let blood in the right veine, and then againe binde vp the wounde. Such corrections are smoothlie couered with an vnexpected prayse: and the memory of their former vertues toucheth the mind with a noble and feeling shame of the present fault. Againe, it is better to entreate by perswasions, then enforce by cō∣maundementes, for feare and ser∣uile restraint (the instruments to com¦pulsion)
exasperate free spirites▪ making them who would bee ouer∣weighed with the sweete violence of reasonable wordes, to cast awaye shame and perseuere in faultes. Eue∣ry man desireth to haue this com∣mendation added to his actions, that they are naturall, and not affected eyther for feare of punishment, or hope of rewarde. Hee gouerneth better, who suffereth men to bee good, then hee that maketh men good: but aboue all I approue that moderation in parents, which shall seeme rather to haue found then rē∣dred their children dutifull. Fathers must loue their children with that affection that they ought: but let them perceiue as little, as the gentlenes of their nature wil beare, neyther too lauishly giuing them the reines: nor too carefully grieuing them for want of well ruled libety. And although the best rules be to in∣ure them to labour, to acquaint thē with simple dyet, so that by custome all miserable actions may be natural:
yet if there bee not a moderation v∣sed, young mindes will be presently discountenanced, and great spirites embased with no smal empairement of their worth: for little mindes, though neuer so full of vertue, can be but a little vertuous. Essay. 4. Of Exercise. THe exercise ought to bee such, which may occupie euerie parte of the bodie, as the play at the ball, ne∣uer sufficiently commended by Gal∣len: or hunting, by which men are accustomed to contraries, to heates, to coldes, to watchinges▪ to fastings, to water▪ to beere, to wine. To commende hunting I neede not, onelie I will say, that it ma∣keth men laborious, labor begetteth
good customes, good customes are the rootes of good lawes, lawes founded vppon such groundes, the producers of militarie prowes, and that where these three concurre in a∣ny degree of excellency, they cannot but make a strong & puissant com∣mon weale. But aboue all other re∣creations it confirmeth the bodie in abilitie both of doing and suffering, & acquainteth the mind by degrees with daunger: so that I may say as Cicero did of Fencng: that it is, For∣tissima aduersus mortem, & dolorem disciplina: For in that, it resem∣bleth perill, it maketh vs familiar with perill, (custom diminishing the terror of those thinges, which by na∣ture are indeed fearefull,) and so by little and little resolueth vs against a∣ny dauntings, which the imminency of daunger might draw with it. So Marus before hee would bring out his souldiers to fight with the Cim∣bres, set them vppon the trenches to acquaint themselues with the terri∣ble aspect, and immane bodies of
those Sauages: and by this counsel brought to passe, that now they be∣gan to contemne those which at the first sight they amasedly feared. His artibus futuri duces imbue∣bantur, sayeth Plinie: for by these sportes images of battailes were de∣liuered to the memorie, which after¦warde abler iudgement might dis∣pence: wherupon the ancient Wor∣thies, and Heroes which ranged the whole world to their obeysance, are reported to haue beene bred in the woodes, and employed in continual huntinges: by which they did not onely strengthen their body, resolue their mindes, but also being ridden in all Groundes became good disco∣uerers (a qualitie very mainelie re∣quired in a conductor): for a man hauing perfectly beaten one place, may sooner attaine to know the sci∣tuation of another, because all regi∣ons do somewhat resemble one ano∣ther in proportion, and so by compa∣ring one known, a man may compē∣diously enforme himselfe of mnie vnknown.
Essay. 5. Of Learning. ALthough Learning haue a priuate and pleasing end in it self, as being the harbor where the free & vntroubled consideration hath a de∣lightfull repose from the Sea of more vnquiet thoughts, yet it is but a ser∣uing qualitie, preparing the minde to a nobler end of well doing, which (as the proud inconstāt Stoikes held) dooth not consist in refrayning or ceasing, but in working and perfor∣ming, and is not a defect or not do∣ing of thinges, but an effect or doing of thinges. For knowledge teacheth not her own vse, but as a necessary mean inableth vs for good actions, and it
ought to be measured by vertue, & if loued for any thng, it must bee, be∣cause it enformeth to do vertuously. It is an excellēt cōmendatiō, that Pli¦nie attributeth to Traiā: Praestas quae∣cun{que} trcipūt antū{que} eas (literas) di∣ligis, quantū ab illisprobaris. We must vse the precepte of Learning as the Lawes of our behauiour, accounting of them in no other proportion, then as the waiting Ministers, by whose mediation a more easie accesse is pre∣pared to wisedome: we must remem∣ber, that the glorie and increase of knowledge consists in the exercising goodnes: that these maiden muses do not aunswere the hope of men, ex∣cept they bee ioyned to that mascu∣line and actiue power of the minde, which maketh vs performe good thinges and great thinges. So when Rome was in her flou∣rishing age, and began to terrefie all Countries with the fame of her ex∣pected greatnes, euen at that time, Ingeniura nemo sine corpore exercebat, there was none who freed his minde
to take repast on these so diuine sci¦ences, but hee remembred that hee had a bodie with fitte organs to in∣ure their behests, and that he should be a forgetfull receiuer of his coun∣tries benefits, except he in some sort made recompence by imploying his powers for her aduauncement and good. Too much to retire to these stu∣dies doth not accorde with state or grauitie: but by separating a man from more worthie deuoires, bring∣eth him into contempt: It is an hap∣pie hing to keepe a meane of wise∣dome, least while wee thinke too much of doing, wee leaue vndone the effecte of thinking: but espe∣ciallie we must eschew with too ve∣hement feruencie to embrace this glorious profession, and record that saying of Cato, that actiue minds can not be with a more honest dlenesse, then the studie of letters, corrupted nor idlenes by any greater or more dangerous pollicie, find easie enter∣tainement in a well gouerned com∣mon-weale.
Some obiect, that howsoeuer this refiner of inuention learning is commendable in lower fortunes, yet in Greate men it is an occasion of more intollerable vices: that it ray∣seth their thoughtes into vaine regi∣ons of ambition, and to the accom∣plishment of things not Feasible, that it overmastreth their reasō with the sweete insinuation of haughty mat∣ters, directing them to worke their priuate ambitions with the publike inconuenience. To this I aunswere that the argument is taken onelie frō the abuse, and therefore of no validi∣tie, because al reasons eyther of praise or dispraise ought to bee taken from the right vse, to which a thing is di∣rected. Moreouer I thinke, that their conceit is inueagled with the same fury, which possessing some such goodlesse mindes, hath taught them to inueigh against the vnspeakable wisedome of the Creator, for this reason onely, because hee had en∣dewed them with reason. For (say
they) as wine because it doth seldom helpe, but often distemper the sicke, is better deteyned, least through a soothing hope of doubtfull health, a certaine daunger bee incurred: so (this swift mouing of the mind) rea∣son is better denied to creatures, be∣cause more abuse it to naughtinesse, then rightlie vse it in vertuous en∣terprises. And a little to vrge on this so strange position, Is there any wrong glozed, any right eluded, any discord sowed, any machination, or guile layed to entrappe the wel-meaning of honest men, but reason worketh it euen with a more refined sharpnes of inuention. Ingeniosior enim est ad excogitandum simulation vertitate, ser∣uitu libertate, metus amore. In the Tragedies wee may see Medea, with what cunning and quaint discourse of reason, what subtle preparation she seeketh to compas her deseignes, while laying this groūdhold of pro∣ceeding.
Fructus est scelerum tibi nullum scelus putare. Shee worketh by congratulating her enemies with giftes, knowing that to be a course, where warie distrust might make no preuention of her malice. Nay, to leaue fables, and come to the life of truth historie: had not Nero great reason to supplant all those. whose libertie of minde hee could not endure, as a thing hurtful to his seate of tyrannie. His reason tolde him, that absolute power was giuen him from the Gods, that hee onelie as Lord could giue fortune to the world, and distribute haps, and mishaps at his pleasure▪ that it was an vntimely policy to preserue those men, who standing strong in their owne vertue and loue of the people might heaue him out of that abhomi∣nable iniustice and vsurpation. But these reasons are but colours, to keep our iudgement from entring into consideration of the true cause, which in these smiling railers stirreth
vp an ingratefull scorne against lite∣rature: And I thinke their hatred proceedeth eyther from Domitians reason, who priuie to himelf of mot horrible vices, exiled hese artes: Ne quid vsquam honesti ocles occurreres or from reuerence, as to a minde guiltie there is nothing more terrible then the sight of that which might plucke into the remembrance the omitting of doing worthilie. E∣uen so if vertue were behelde in bo∣dily organs, vndoubtedly she would not as some Philosophers haue taught, stir vp the degenerate minds to embrace her effectes, but rather work a dsire neuer to come to look vpon her: for as men did see, so they would againe be seene by hr, and the sight woulde rubbe into their mindes, and vrge their consciences with deserued infamie and vice in such comparison would seeme fuller of deformity, and then men so hard∣ly aggrieued woulde forsake both feare and shame (the onelie meanes to withdraw euil men from wicked
courses, and put on such a proud cō∣tempt, as should take a brauerie and felicitie in naughtines. Essay. 6. Of Experience. EXperience is the guide of the vnderstanding, the rule of will, the ouerru∣ler of opinion, the soule, and most intier parte of wisedome, without which euen the most abso∣lute Schollers cannot attaine to any degree of perfection in ciuil actions. There is more certaintie in the prin∣ciples of practise, then in the most necessary demonstrations or clearest discourses of reason: and these men that are intendants and practised in the occurrents of Courtes, are fitter for anie actiue emploiment, and can with better easinesse dispatch anie
businesses: Quoniam enim habet culum ab ipsa experientia, vident ipsū principium. These are as it were trusty Oracles, on whose iudgement a mā may safely reappose his whole for∣tunes: they are vppon earth instar praesciorum numinum, whose aduise a man ought to take, before he engage himselfe in any action. For the meane, by which wise∣dome in ableth vs to foresee the suc∣cesse, and accordingly after due con∣sideration rule the present is coniec∣ture, which by comparing thinges passed, presupposeth out of the same causes, the same effects: Now in this obscure and incertaine deliberation vpon the future, a man experienced is like him, who hauing tried a daun∣gerous passage in his own person, & noted the by turnings which might di¦uert him into an error, can in the dar¦kest night with a secure & forwarde alacritie, go the same way, and ouer∣comming all the difficulties, ariue at the appointed place, wheras another though furnished with the soundest
directions) yet neuer hauing proued it, quaketh at euery shadow) and ha∣uing his spirites shut vp in amaze∣ment, plainelie hazardeth his per∣son. The rules to perfect experience are, to frequent the courtes of iu∣stice, as Free schooles of ciuill lear∣ning, to endeuour to vnderstand all occuriences, to confer concerning the newes of the world with men ex∣pert, reall, of a deepe insight, such as are not carried away with apparā∣ces, but can spie daye light at a little hole, and make iudgement out of matters themselues, and discerne be∣tweene truth and truth likenes, and know when ouert deseignes are the foyles of more eminent intentions. Essay. 7. Of Hystories. HIstorie is the mixture of pro∣fite and delight, the seasoning
of more serious studies, the reporter of cases adiudged by euent, the interlude of our haps, the image of our present fortune, the compendi∣ary director of our affaires, by which valor is quickned, iudgement ripe∣ned, and resolution entertained. Here are the reasons, why some e∣states liue quietlie, others turmoiled in continuall disturbances, some flourish by the delights of peace, o∣thers by continuing warre, some spend lauishlie without profite, o∣thers sparinglie with honor. Here wee may see ruines wihout fee, daungerous warres without perill, the customes of all nations without expence. By this obseruation of noting causes and effectes, counselles and successes, likenes betweene nature and nature, action and action, for∣tune and fortune is obtayned that wisedome, which teacheth vs to de∣liberate with ripenes of iudgement, to perseuere in thinges deliberated, to execute with readines, to tempo∣rise
with inconueniences, to abide aduersitie, to moderate prosperitie, to know the Scriptures, but in such sort, that neyther superstition make vs vainely feareful, nor neglect cause vs to be contemptuously presuming. And by opening to vs the plottes, which gaue life to all the actions, it teacheth more then twentie men li∣uing successiuelie can learn by prac∣tise, as the Generall by seeing the counselles which gouerne the euent must necessarilie profite more then the Souldier, who not able to search into the causes, perceiueth onely the naked euents. But as Histories are diuerse, so their operation in benefiting the per∣users are diuers. In some as it were in Cleanthes table, vertue is set out in her best ornamentes, as in the de∣scribing of famous battelles, where specious wars, the ruine of nations, the scituation of Countries, the vn∣certaine trauerses of fortune, the death of braue Commaunders, haue a certain kind of Maiesty linked with
delight, and the mind by conuersing in them is not onelie delighted, but also lifted vp with a spirite of better resolution, and raysed to thinke of imitating: These fil a mā with better courage, but faile in inabling him for the manage of ciuill actions. Another kind there is like la∣byrinths, relating cunning and de∣ceitfull friendshippes, how rage is suppressed with silence, treason dis∣guised in innocence, how the weal∣thy haue beene proscribed for their riches, and the worthy vndermined for their vertue. These prouoke vs to eschew their viletie and lacke of vertue, and to be rather viceles then greatly vertuous: and although they bee distasted by those who measure Historie by delight, yet they are of most vse in instructing the minde to the like accidentes. And sithens men prostituting their wittes to all hopefull endes of gaine, are ready to aduenture themselues in the like ac∣tions, they are the most necessarie thinges, that can be warned vs, to
the intent that in the like practises, me may seeke meanes of preuention and frustrate all the attempts of such subtlely euill companions. In this ranke I preferre Tacitus as the best that any man can dwel vpon: Hee sheweth the miseries of a torne and declining state, where it was a capitall crime to bee vertu∣ous, and nothing so vnsafe as to be securely innocent, where great mens gestures were particularly interpre∣ted, their actions aggrauated, and construed to proceed from an aspi∣ring intent: and the prince too sus∣pitiously iealous touching points of concurrancie, suppressed men of great deserte, as competitors with them in that chiefest grounde, the loue of the people: When Prin∣ces rather delighted in the vi∣ces of their Subiectes, eyther be∣cause euerie man is pleased with his owne disposition in ano∣ther, or because by a secret of long vse, they thought those would most patientlie endure seruitude, whose
contemptible manners and viletie, might excuse their base subiection. Hee sheweth how enformers men of desperate ambition, sharpe-sighted in spying faultes, and cunning in amplifying occasions of dislike, for∣sware all honesty, redeeming the se∣curitie of their own persons with the losse of good name, and liuing on the vices of men, as scarrabeckes on vicerous sores: How vaine men were preferred to be treasurers, that they might fall with their proper va∣nities and want of gouernment, be∣ing vsed like spūges, which after they had beene wet with the spoiles and extortions, were crushed and con∣demned that their long gathered wealth might returne to the Princes coffers. Here some inferre, that the knowledge of euill doth induce and draw men to effect, that the imitati∣on of an euill doth alway excell the prsident in height of mischiefe, but the following of vertue doth scarse aequalize the example in any degree
of goodnes, that the conuersing in Tacitus doth deterre men from do∣ing worthilie, where are Canii, Sene∣cae, Sorani, Aruntii, men of admirable vertues in so corrupt a gouernment, ouerliuing their prosperitie, and dy∣ing, like Traytors in the same age, whē Seaanus an impudent informer straungelie compounded of the two cōtrarieties of pride and flatterie, in shew modest, & therefore more dan∣gerouslie aspiring, sweigheth the for∣tunes of men at his pleasure, and by lucky passing through mischieuous deuises, is growne Ferox sceleris, & emboldned in his trecheries▪ But yet these men ought to re∣mēber that those mischiefes are but mischiefes to a baser minde. Quem∣cunque sortem videris, miserum neges: that although they were oppressed, yet they remained still superiors, go∣uernors of necessity, rather directing then obeying the vexations. And I will not denie but such corrupte mindes may also suckle venome out of the most wholesome flowers, and
armed with some dangerous Positi∣ons out of the treasure of bookes, may like poyson mingled with the best wine more forciblie hurt by trayning on their mischieuous pur∣poses more cunningly: But yet mee thinkes, men haue great incitements to hold themselues vp in vertue, by seeing euill men so contemptuouslie set forth, quaking with the inner vp∣braidings of conscience, not enter∣taining sleepe, but disquieted with a continually tormenting executio∣ner: Wee may learne also to prayse God for our gratious Soueraigne, vnder whose peacefull raigne, wee are secured from all those miseries, and enioy all those benefites whose worth wee shall know, when wee suffer priuation of thē, vnder whom our subiection is to the law, our ser∣uice obseruation, our obedience a care not to offend. In Tacitus are three notes, which are required in a perfect Historie, first, truth insincerely relating with∣out hauing any thing Haustum ex va∣o:
secondly, explanation in disco∣uering not only the sequels of things but also the causes & reasons: third∣ly iudgement indistinguishing things by approuing the best, and disallow∣ing the contrarie, but yet hee per∣formeth this with such an art, hiding art, as if hee were alud agens, by enterlacing the seris of the tale, with some iudiciall, but strangelie briefe sentences. In making vse of this Historie knowledge, we must not ascertaine to our selues the sequell of any thing to fall out iust according to the like case in the Historie, but determine of it, as a thing apte to chance other∣wise: for an example only enformes a likelyhoode, and if we gouerne our counselles by it, there must be a con∣currance of the same reasons, not onelie in generall, but also in parti∣cularities. In making iudgement of Histo∣rie, and consideratelie applying it to our present interestes, wee must spe∣ciallie regard the dispositions of the
agentes, and diligentlie remarke how they are affected in minde, which is the least deceyuing ground of forming opinion: for without this pondering, and knowledge of the qualities of those nations, which we meet with in reading, a mā is vna∣ble to make any due comparison be∣tweene the present particular, and the former example. But to leaue these disputations, and the causes of variety in Customes to the schooles, as a matter some will not graunt, & fewer vnderstand, I will onely giue some instances of the proper quali∣ties of some Countries, which most familiarly occurre in reading. The auncient Romaines were men of an inuincible spirit, not dismayed with what frowning disasters soeuer for∣tune could suppresse their courage, and hauing a minde superior to all aduersitie, resembled Antaeus in the Poet, who so often as hee was thrown to the ground receiued fresh strength, but being lifted vppe, was soone tamed by his aduersary: so
they in their declining state, promi∣sing better of their hopes, armed vp their valour, and were filed with a greater brauerie of mind, but com∣ming to the height of felcitie, and flowing with the spoiles of the whole worlde, ouerswayed with thir owne grandeure, beganne to quaile in the last act, and after a safe escape from the maine sea of forrain incumbrances, to suffer shipwracke in the hauen: then ouer many good fortunes bred in them a proude reck∣leshnes, then through the disuse of armes all thinges fell into the relapse and priuate dissentions were kind∣led to ruine themselues, then the ci∣tie which was wont to giue law to the whole world, began to be facun∣da inimicitiis, fruitfull in prouoking partialities, desirous of ciuil tumults, craftie in espying and aggrauating secret dislikes, ready to catch at any occasion of innouation. Their valor made them quiet, and quiet wealthy: but according to the reuolution of al things with a swift & violent return
their wealth effiminated their valour with idlenes, idlenes occasioned dis∣order, disorder made ruine. And as the iron begetteth rust which consu∣meth it, and ripe fruites produce worms which eate it, so their great∣nes nourished such vices as by little and little brought them to confusi∣on, insomuch that a great time their state was maintained more by repu∣tation of thinges done, then any o∣ther present foundation. The French are too aduenturous in the imminency & neaenes of pe∣rill, ouerwaging the difficulties of terror with a too furious resolution, in assault more then men, in main∣taining the medley lesse then womē, very irregular in their actions, groū∣ding them vppon fallible hopes and vaine expectations, light, inconstant, insolent in prosperitie, destined ra∣ther to conquere, then keep: as con∣trarilie the Venetians haue recoue∣red by the arts of peace and compo∣sition that, which they haue forgon by war.
The Spaniards are subtle, wrap∣ping their drifts in close secresie, ex∣pressing surelie in their wordes, but keeping their intentions dissembled vnder disguised assurance of amitie, betraying the innocency of their friendes, in malice infinite▪ and so o∣uer carried with that passion, that for the most parte they execute a re∣uenge farre aboue the nature of the offence: not giuing any suddaine apparance of it, but waiting for op∣portunity so much redouble the blow, by how much it hath beene nourished with tract of time, and hung in suspence. Essay. 8. Of Art Militarie. THere is a barbarous opinion of the contrari∣etie of armes and lear∣ning, and the impossi∣bility
of their meeting in any person: which vnreasonable Paradoxe well sitteth those who know nothing but the fury of strength, and not the ver∣tue of courage. For without this, fortitude is intiteled to those acti∣ons which holde rather of vice, and the more it seekes to hurt, the lesse it is able to hurt, and is eyther a rash∣nes which after the first brunt dieth in it selfe, Et vt quaedam animalia, a∣misso aculo torpit, and cannot hurt, like some beastes which shoote the sting, and partake no more with the poyson, or a false vigor proceeding from dispaire, when men weary of the worldes eyes shall thrust them∣selues into manifest perill without a∣ny sufficient ground of reason: or a fiercenes, when choller & the effects of anger are made the motiues of va∣lor, or a confidence, when a man af∣ter the often aspect of daunger, & by the lucky passing of diuers sightes is become hazardous, and enterprising in such sort, as the vice of drinking▪ In pralia trudit ermē. Without ler∣ning
Hercules is furious, Dares in∣solent, Achilles ouercome with vain delightes, vnable to commaund his owne decent appetites, and ready to haue ingloriously separated himselfe from reuealing his vertue, if wise Vlisses had not by a timely policie drawne him to retire into himselfe, and consider the fraile foundations of those weakenesses, which did so infeeble his resolution. But although learning bee of great consequence in perfection of a martiall man, yet experience is the chiefest point, neyther can a man be absolute by reading other mens ex∣ploites. The true Schoole of warre, is the fielde, and not the Chamber▪ the teacher is vse, and the best course for attaining is to bee present in the important deliberations, to obserue and ponder vpon the executions, to consider the euents, and the counsels which gouerned them, from which obseruation ariseth that wisedome, which inableth vs to make choice of our aduantages, to aduance oppor∣tunities,
to cut off by celeritie all dis∣course of counsell from the enemie, to make his inuentions sorte to his proper ruine, to ouercome by quick∣nes the difficultie of those thinges which could not be suppressed by ex∣pecting, to accommodate prouisoes to all chaunces, to alter our deter∣minations according to the sudden∣nes and varietie of occurrences, nei∣ther to feare nor despise the enemy, but to remember, Vt semper pendeat hamus, to be readie to catch at that period of time, occasion, which by a fortunate meeting of circumstances doth ease vs in the compassing our proiectes. Great men ought to frequent the warre, proposing to themselues these three reasons which moued Tiberi∣us to addresse Drusus into Illyricum: The first was, suescere militiae, to inure and experience him in warfare: for it is not sufficient to haue military sci∣ence in our minde, but by often me∣ditations to make it familiar to our hands and feet. He is the best soul∣dier
that is most experimented, nei∣ther can I more fitly compare these booke knightes then to a Musitian, who insisting onely vpon the Theo∣ricke, is not able to expresse anie thing. The second was, Studia exercitus parare, to wind himselfe into the fa∣uour of the Souldiers: which thing of what consequence it is in raysing and preferring a man, wee may see in Hannibal, who being whole a mar¦tiall man, borne and nourished in his Fathers pauilion and sight of the sol∣diers, was before the prime of his youth chosen generall through their cōsent & applause: neither was there any other apparant cause of the ob∣tayning that dignitie at so vnripe yeares but the affection of the army: which alway desireth such a Leader, whose manners they are most famili∣arly acquainted with. The chiefe rules to get this fame and reputation are these, to haue a watchfull eye, a diligent hand, a resolute heart, at the beginning to do
rather too much then too lit∣tle, sometime to hazard fairely, to watch and warde, to glory in being content with a little, not to bee more costly apparrelled, then a pri∣uate souldier, Arma & equi con∣spiciantur: in action, to bee heed∣fully earnest, to refuse no employ∣ment for feare, nor enter into any vppon an humor of ostentation, to suppresse the esteeme of your at∣chiuements, and vndeualewing them humbly like a Minister, re∣ferre the honor to the Fortune of the Generall. For such modestie augmenteth the fame of vertue, be∣ing indeede like those shadowes which cunning painters vse to in∣crease the lustre, and grace of their protraytures: & men seeing such re∣spectles such account made of things done, will preoccupy conceites of some nobler future successes: Iu∣gurthaes arte in inworthying him∣selfe was, purimum facere, & i∣il de sipso loqui, and so hee con∣quered
enuie, and the passion of ae∣mulation with an infinite glo∣rie. The thirde reason was, Simul Iuuenem vrbano luxu lasciuentem, melius in castris haberi rebatur Ti∣berius. Therefore the Campe must not bee frequented as a secure and priuiledged place of licentiousnes, but as a Schoole where the bodie ought to bee inured, and by con∣tinuall labour subiected to the mi∣series of trauell, thereby not to bee daunted in the imminencie of daunger, nor to feare a wound but with an inuincible vi∣gor to endure all cor∣porall aduer∣sities.
Essay. 9. Of Trauell. TRauell entertaineth a mā with delight, neyther is there any o confirmed in a contempt of all world∣ly thinges, who findeth not himselfe out of a meere instinct of nature, in∣finitely pleased with the statelie re∣presentation and Maiestie of strange and famous cities: But what an in∣ward oblectation it is to see the ru∣ines of Theaters, of triumphall Ar∣cusses, to view the places which doe yet testifie the vertues of the ancient Worthies, Et campos vbi Troia fuit, They know best, whose minds so are higher, and become greater by be∣holding
the memorials of other mēs glory and magnificence. But because reason biddeth vs to prouie rather for the beautifying of our nobler part the mind, then for th flattring of sense, the chief scope must be abilitie, and the greatest de∣light to feele with Solon: Senescere se multa indies addiscentem. For althogh these studies require rather retired∣nes & immunitie frō those disquiets which this (vnsetled kind of life) tra∣uelling doth draw with it: yet let vs know that to this ornamēt of now∣ledge concur not onely the sense of seeing, to conuerse in the monumēts and treasure of bookes▪ but also of hearing in conferring with men, ex∣cellent in euerie profession: in enfe∣lowshipping with diuerse natures & dispositions. For this varietie of companie bettereth behauiour, sub∣telizeth artes, awaketh and exerci∣seth wit, ripeneth iudgement, con∣firmeth wisedome, and enricheth the mind with many worthy and profi∣table obseruations: performing all
these by so secret a working, and in∣sensible alteration, that a man doth sooner acknowledge himselfe much abler, then hee can apprehende the meanes: Euen as in the growing of a tree we perceiue not the succes∣siue motion of encrease, but at length may sufficientlie assure our selues, that there hath beene an augmenta∣tion. In this obseruation, as there are many generall thinges, with which a man may trust himselfe, so there are many particularities which are more speciallie to bee obserued, as most powerfull to inspire vs with ciuill wisedome, and inable our iudgement for any actiue employ∣ment, vid. the religion, lawes, forme of gouernement, scituation, castles, fortifications, citties, forces, what neighbours confine, of what power, how inclined: The noble Families, their discents, intermarriages, their potencie, either immediate of them∣selues, or by reason of the kinges countenance, their adherences, sects,
dependencies, partialities, and th causes of all. But because in forraine countri∣es there are many peculiar vices co∣uered with the spetious semblanc of humanitie, which hauing born long sweigh and growing into cu∣stom, vnworthily find not also par¦don, but also commendation: an our weaknes is prone to participa those euill habites, which eythe flatter it with noueltie, or deceiue with a gloious shew of vertue, therfore a man ready to enter such expe∣ditions must obserue these rules,  the chiefest preseruations of reaso against any such infection, so muc the more daungerous, when th contagion inueagleth and entereth in the aire of a peruerse approbation. For assuring our selues that whe are many vices, there are also infnite vertues (because no euill is  bad, as that which proceedes fro the corrupte seedes of goodnesse wee must in such places affect th
familiaritie of the best, by all conue∣nient obseruances, endearing them who as they preacede in all worthie qualities: so especiallie in this ver∣tue of easines and humanitie. And although many daungerous mindes are hidden vnder the false Glasse and deceiuable apparances of feighned meekenes (a vertue rather taken on, then taken into them) yet the best rule is (if there bee no other manifest cause of prohibition) to applie to their conuersation, who are most ex∣cellent in the Formes of behauiour: For thereby men are bettered in a certaine externall vertue of ciuilitie and gentlenes: which if it flowe kindlie, natural without forcing a∣gainst the hare and voide of the two imperfections affecting, and ostenta∣tion vndoubtedlie cannot but wor∣thilie commende a man, and make demonstration of a mind aunswera∣ble. In meeting with natures close and retired, spare in reuealing them selues, conformed to all turninges
of sleightes, skilfull in dissembling passions, such as can pretexe spite with a countenance of amitie, it is good (if they bee innocent and harmeles) to vse semblinges, as op∣portune defences to frustate their proiectes, but not as machina∣tions inuented for mischieuing. Ther∣fore the countenance (the gate of the minde) must bee open and free to al, the toung sparing in vtterance of thinges of importance, the minde closed, and this remembred. Chi vuol andar per passe, deue hanere boc∣ca d porcello, L'orechie d' asinello. Essay. 10. Of Affabilitie. Affabilitie is like Musicke, which is made by a iudi∣ciall correspondency of a sharpe and flatte, it is a
mixture of pleasingnes, and seuerity in such sort, that neyther gentlenes by being a derogation, weaken re∣uerence, nor seueritie loue. It is not sufficient to be altoether reall in performing the effectes of a louing minde: but also euerie man requi∣reth to bee assured by vtter apparan∣ces, as messengers of the inner in∣tentions: And if by these oblati∣ons a man giue not his friend confi∣dence and suretie, I may not vnfitly compare his beneuolence to an i∣mage, which in it selfe well propor∣tioned, but not apparrelled in apte colours, doth want that delightfull lustre, which should satisfie the gree∣die eyes of the spectators. A man must bee not onely pre∣sent in ministring any conuenience office, but also by sending forth in the countenance the paunes and as∣surance of loue, by exciting men to open and reueale their businesses, and by promising al conuenient fur∣therance. For as men warme in the youthfull desires of loue, take grea∣test
comfort by being seene of their Mistresse, and receiue more ioye from a wanton looke, then from any other sense: so among all the kind offices of friendship, there is none so desired, as this acknowledgement by outward respects, especially whē the ende is meere salutation: for there is no more contrarie enemie to true friendshippe, then the motion of proper interest. The Romaines not to defraud a∣ny man of a due and conuenient Congie, retained certain Admoni∣tors (called Nmenclatores) who should suggest the name, qualitie, and accounte of euery one they in∣countred, that they might be saluted in a conformable stile: for to looke straunge and disdainefull, to bee backward in returning these respects procureth hatred euen in the dearest friendes, so much more daungerous, by how much men can lesse endure to be despised, then iniuried, because other grieuances concerne onelie the bodie, and bringe this com∣fort,
that hee is some bodie in his conceite that so offended him: but the iniuries of contempte are a dis∣reputation, and the offended taketh himselfe to bee accounted no body, and therefore such omissions can hardlie by any meanes bee redee∣med. Caesar through his wonderful ver∣tues had setled himselfe in the strong loue of the people, and with his ea∣sinesse and affabilitie, (as with sugar sprinckled vpon a bitter medicine,) had mittigated the giefe, which a Romaine spirit might take from the pretious remembrance of lost liber∣tie: while by seeming to arrogate no∣thing, hee obtayned that all affaires of consequence should remain at his deuotion: yet one vncircumspec∣tion in not receiuing the senate with due reuerence, cancelled all memo∣ry of former desertes, gaue his ene∣mies honest colour to beare him ill will, and authorised an opinion, that his death was meritorious and lawfull.
The seasoning of these oblati∣ons and ceremonies is, a readines to pleasure, deuotion, faith sinceri∣tie, which wee ought to addesse according to the present opportuni∣tie. In these apparances aequalles must bee esteemed superiors, and no circumstance must be omitted, eyther of meeting, or of accompani∣ing, or of salutation: for these out∣ward forms are obserued as demon∣strations of the inward affection: In∣feriors must bee receiued with ma∣nifestation of an hopeful willingnes to see them compeares, by acknow∣ledging their merite and worthines: but if they bee of aequall rancke, (as followers of some geat state) a man must stand indifferent to all: other∣wise some will bee discontent, and thinke him moued with passons: o∣thers insolent, when they know that hee is necessited to depende on them, howsoeuer they entreate him. If any shall importune an vnwon∣ted request, the repulse must bee
modest by shewing the qualitie of the matter to be intractable, by ren∣dring some sufficient excuse (which may arise from the circumstances of time and place, or oher infinite ac∣cidentes) by reuealing a desire to o∣pen in a more fitte time those effects which enuious occasiō will not now permit. Thus Denials will bee in∣terpreted as speciall fauours, and mē filled with a certaine hopefull reui∣uing of minde will bee contented with promise. Sic homines fronte & oratione mags, quam ips beneficio, re{que} capiuntur. The way to attaine acceptable behauiours, is not a point of ende∣uour, (for then it is feighned, & it alway chanceth that feighned cur∣tesie turneth to pride) but rather cō∣sisteth in a certaine induction and readines of the mind, wich if it bee excellent, will easily sute it selfe in these Formes: for (as it was saide by one, whome to name were presumptiō) behauiour is but a gar∣ment, and it is easie to make a comly
garment for a body in it self wel pro¦portioned, whereas a deformed bo∣dy can neuer bee so helped by Tay∣lorsarte, but the counterfeiting will appeare. Obseruation also is a good meane, but a carelesnesse in expres∣sing doth adde a singular grace, as one motion in dauncing kindlie pro∣ceeding, performed recklesly, cun∣ningly implieth that a man can doo better then he can. If there bee a∣ny art vsed, it must bee in hiding art, otherwise it will hold eyther of affected selfe conceite, or of tedious ostentation. Againe, it is not sufficient to prouoke men to disclose their inter∣estes, by giuing ready audience and easie accesse: but also a man must patientlie attend their sutes, the be∣hauiour being such, as may shew all our powers occupied in considerati∣on of them, but by contradicting or foreconceiuing of the conclusi∣on to breake off their conceites is a contempt, which toucheth the mind, and cannot bee redeemed with
neuer so great good pleasures. To denie a sute doth dismisse men discontented, therefore in some cases it is better to promise, althogh there appeare no conueniencie for the effectuating: for howsoeuer the present affaire bee disappointed, yet men are more pleased with him, whom they see hindered in dispatch of weightier occurrences, then they would bee if they receiued a flat de∣niall. This rule although it cannot stand with the strict preceptes and square of honesty, yet it is a speciall point of this qualitie, (which I may call with Cicero, Artificium beneuo∣lentia colligendae) which is eyther a vertue, or cannot stande without vertue. Also benefits must seeme to be receiued rather of curtesie then of deseruing: and (amplifications drawne from the circumstances) it is good highlie to esteeme them, as matters of great moment and very necessary, and employed in time: for men loue to be accounted profita∣table,
and to haue their seruices ac∣knowledged. Essay. 11 Of Iestes. IT is a point of Affabili∣tie to interlarde our discourses with some sayinges which may come from a readinesse of Witte, and to place Mercurie (as it were) in the middest of the graces. A continued graue spechdoth hold of tediousnes: To abuse Iestes too often doth diminish the reputation of the busines, and impairth graui∣tie: but as a little water dooth not quench the fire, but is vsed to inflame it: so these wittie sayinges seruing oportunitie, and sparinglie scattered in our speech, are acceptable in re∣enforcing of it, and causing a stron∣ger
apprehension. They are the seasoning, and must not want that matter and iudgement which ought to bee seasoned: otherwise in stead of giuing a delicate tast, they becom tediously troublesome: He rein let vs imitate wise painters, who chifly propose to coūterfeyt the miniature lesse intentiue to the vtter ornamēts as thinges apt to bee varied, as shall best serue for setting forth the prin∣cipall: so the minde must bee ac∣commodated to the present busines, and iestes (the apparrelling of our speech) vsed as Parentheses, which being in bewtifie, and marre not the sense. And as skilfull Architectes so dispose the windowes in a statelie e∣difice, that neither the multitude weaken the house, nor the want bee a deficient cause of darkenes: so a man must prouide that neither the often vse of Iestes cause him to in∣curre the name of ridiculous, nor the want breede opinion of incour∣teous asteritie. And as they take
in the light where the aire swimming along a pleasant place, may make the prospect more excellent: so wee ought to inlette a iest into the body of more graue reasonings, when the oportunitie and lucky meeting of circumstances may make the delight more full. These iestes are of speciall force in auoiding idle questions (manie thinges being fit so to be aunswered least they might bee thought worthy of a graue determination) vanita proprié festiuitas cedit. They are more passable after prouocation and the apprehension of the wit appe∣reth greater, especiallie if the coun∣tenance be graue, and set, and if more may bee surmised then the bare letter doth expresse: All disho∣nest formes or vulgar basenes must be eschewed: They must not note a∣ny true defect, and therefore with weake and small natures, not stan∣ding vpon the might and strength of their owne vertues, it is good to containe many words, which may
relish of a wittie pleasingnes. For presentlie, men guiltie, thinke their ate is touched, whereas another, who pretēdeth to vertue, and out of wel grounded confidence, feareth no disreputation would bee delighted. They must not concerne any mans present calamitie: for men in mise∣rie are prone to suspect, and receiue any thing as a contumelie, by an im∣potency perswaded that their misery is derided, and in minds already tro∣bled, new displeasures make a deeper impression, then they do in such spi∣rites as are free and void of passion. Essay. 12. Of Discretion. DIscretion is the Gouernesse of vertue, the rule of our beha∣uiour,
the measure of our affections, the Mistresse of demeanure, that sea∣soning of our actions, which maketh them acceptable, teaching vs to bee comelie without wantonnes, hand∣some without curiositie, solemne without tediousnes, learned without vaine-glorie, friendly without fac∣tiousnesse, seuere without disquiet, valiant without brauing, courteous with grauitie, and benigne with Ma∣iesty: and to conclude it is the bal∣lance, in which wee should weigh all our actions. But least in setting forth the pointes of this qualitie, I should stray into the confines of wis∣dome, and intitle it to those actions which holde of an higher vertue, I will restraine it to such indifferent thinges, whose forme and qualitie of vsage may appertaine eyther to vertue or vice: But in performing them a man must bee precise: for the vulgar sort, (Qui stupet in titulis, & imaginubus) not able to see into matters them∣selues, will euer iudge of the sub∣stance
by the circumstances, and ac∣cording to the outwarde semblance preoccupie conceites of the inward intentions: This is that which Cice∣ro commendeth in great Fortunes: non solum animis, sed etiam oculis ser∣iro cinium, & not to thinke him∣selfe discharged, except hee accom∣panie his actions with faire likelie∣hoodes. This modesty (if it be not taken on for shew, nor affected & vi∣olent) is an external composure, and decency of Customes, rising out of that inward moderation, by which all disordinate passions and irregular motions, are subiected to the rule of reason, and through which a man ful¦filleth that Decorum, which by a sweete Harmonie and good accorde of fitte time and place, addeth a sin∣gular grace to all our actions: teach∣ing vs to put a difference in persons, and which diuers natures to treat di∣uerslie: with familiars to bee open hearted, with strangers suspitious, with cleare dealing men secure, with subtle Companions warie, with
pleasants delicate, with the lear∣ned real, with the ambitious desirous of their greatnes, with the modest free from passions, with the interes∣sed distrustfull, to euill men spaing in giuing trust: And by this apply∣ing to euery mans humor, thinges difficult become facile, and matters of trouble loose their grieuousnes. Some men are so incapable, that they make small thinges great, easie businesses impossible, and enterprise nothing, which through their per∣uerse grace is not difficultly accom∣plished, whose frowardnesse a man may compare to the vnskilfulnesse of some Chirurgions, who in steade of healing, fester a wound, and in lieu of mitigation make the torments more grieuously daungerous, where∣as expert Leaches doe with gentle lenitiues redresse the maladie before the Patient haue any feeling of pain. So men discreete hauing their spirits awaked to all circumstances manage matters with a more delicate deport¦ment, and by certaine premised pre∣paratiues
so dispose the mind of the other agent, as it may bee apt to re∣ceiue any form which they shall im∣pose: And with the same art deale with those, who by a crooked nature shew themselues insupportable, or transported with the fury of passions vtter wordes full of disdaine. Now men indewed with this vertue of easinesse, (as cunning Vaulters by a nimble sleight saue themselues frō the impetuous assaulte of the ad∣uersarie) eyther by drawing their reasons frō some vnexpected place, or by passing with a readines of ap∣prehension to a more plausible sub∣iect, or by sounding a farre off with some extrauagant wordes, so follow their vnderstanding, that at length they condescend, vsing the same consideration, which good Players at ball haue, who not to suffer a rest, do not onelie stand attentiue to send it to their companion, but with like heed prouide to retake it, by accom∣modating their person, & expecting is in the likeliest place: so they to
auoide all hinderances doe not onely sute their own wordes, but also giue fauourable cōstructions to the spee∣ches of the other agent, by dissem∣bling the discontentments which might arise: euen as the Sun dooth not altogether moue with the high¦est heauen, nor yet is mooued di∣rectly contrary, but fetching a com∣passe a little ouertwhart, maketh an oblique circle, and by varietie of ap∣proaching and departing keepeth the world in good temperature: So O∣tho being not well established, and knowing that he must moderate that discipline, which might seeme to be exacted in such a case, in repressing a mutinie, imputeth the confusion & disturbances, to a tender and exces∣siue affection of the Souldiers to∣wardes him, more zealous then con∣siderate. Nimia pieta vestra, &c. And thus hee quieted those, who (be∣ing by the guilt of rebellion exclu∣ded from all hope of pardon) might according to the nature of man, (which hateth those whome it hath
hurt) fall to desperatiō of recouering fauour, when desperation in such times of commotions might drawe them to a setled resolution to keepe themselues out of reach of correcti∣on. For if one play false, the best rule is, to seeme not, to perceiue it, & (if he begin (as suspected) to cleare himselfe) to semble neuer to haue doubted of his fidelitie. Qui enim so non puat satafacere, amicus esse nullo mod poest: Therefore Agripp∣ in Tacitus knowing her life at∣tempted by Nro, knew well, that her onelie remedy was to take no notice of the treasons. Neyther is it the part of a ser∣uilie fawning nature, to aunswere them with moderation, which vrge out of passion, but rather a quiet tē∣per grounded vpon a certaine and infallible confidence in vertue. A man must rule his affections and make reason like another Autome∣don to direct them, thereby to tolle∣rate other mens defectes, and make a vertuous resistance against pride,
arrogancie, and other such vniust re∣bellions of passions. Wee must vse the shield of mansu∣etude, which may mitigate the sud∣dennes and fury of anger, compose the inner powers of the minde, and conforme the appetite of reuenge to reason: for this affection not regu∣lated by an higher power, maketh a man forgetfull of God and consci∣ence, depriuing the minde of the light of iudgement, distempering the humors of the bodie, and giuing them a pray to diuerse daungerous diseases. Essay. 13. Of Speech. OVr language must bee na∣turall without affectati∣on▪ honest, comely, signi∣ficant, expressiue, proper,
voide of all feate and effeminate tearmes. In speaking the rules are to vtter our minde freely without dissembling: for words doubtfull and obscure reserued in particular, bound to respect or feare, or argu∣mentes of a base minde, and tokens of imbecilitie of spirit: To auoide in priuate discourses to take vp the chaire: for there is nothing more odious then to affect to bee wise out of time, & learning tasteth not kind∣lie to euerie Pallet: To vse some∣times conceites of learning, as the embroderies, but in an hiden maner like as apparrell doth represent the proportion, but not the barenes of our members. To point at Histories without making any particular rela∣tion of the circumstances: to auoide comparisons, except they be restray∣ned to a Metaphore, for otherwise they cannot be sine apparatu Rheto∣rico, or some other vnseasonable in∣sinuation, To auoide preposterous∣nes, for to know what is treated, is the mother of attention in the hear∣er.
But generallie it is the greatest wisedome rather to attend others, then to be an eloquent Marchant of selfe conceites, for men expert and practised, can out a mans wordes deduce great consequences, and take light of matters of greate impor∣tance. Essay. 14. Of Wisedome. IF wee will know, what wisedome is, let vs lay aside the curious que∣stions of Schoolemen, and such as are truelie Nominalles, and consider it in the frame of our Microcosme: where are two eyes signifying foresight with pondering vpon the likelihoode of successe, two eares patientlie to ad∣mit the counsell of others, and not
to bee carried away with self com∣placence: one hart for perseuering in an vniforme resolution, and two handes for quicke dispatching, and putting it in execution: And this is wisedome, whereof there cannot bee deuised a more expressiue Hierogli∣phicke, then the composition of our bodies. This heauenly gifte, begetting in our heartes a secret and inuisible light, hath some resemblance to the eies of some couragious wild beasts, which in the morning when euerie silly creature maketh vse of the sight, repose themselues: but in the darke night see clearest, and then addresse themselues to pray: So wisedome in difficulte affaires such as are be∣yonde the straine, and leuell of a cō∣mon discourse, behaueth herself ex∣cellentlie: but triuiall matters with a certaine despisingnes neglecteth or handleth them vnder expectation a a common iudgement would do. Therefore men of a deepe insight & great vnderstanding, hauing neyther
degree nor riches, nor authorities, e∣quall to their sufficiencie in thinges of small momente, as disproportio∣nated to their vertue, behaue them∣selues sometime inconsideratelie carelesse: but admitted to the sweigh¦ing of great matters, vnexpectedlie come to reueale in deedes and con∣ceites that greatnesse and maiestie which by the basenesse of their for∣tune was oppressed and kept vnder. Excitantur enim ad meliora magnitu∣dine rerum, and they loue to be em∣ployed in that which might bee, rare excellent, singular, and aboue the ordi∣nary capacitie. The first parte of Wisedome is deliberation, in which wee must re∣solue neyther with hast nor affection, the one not giuing time enough to discusse those thinges which ought to be considered, the other so occu∣pying the minde, that no thought creepe in which doth not in all re∣gards conforme it selfe to giue suffe∣rance to that passion: wee must pro∣mise our selues nothing before our
conceptions are by great presump∣tions assured of successe. For the feruencie of hope maketh men som∣what more reckleshly negligent, in∣somuch that when they are disapoin∣ted, they are as impatiently grieued, as if they had falne from an essentiall felicitie, like nouice Marchantes, who forecounting great gaines, & failing of their fresh expectation, are suddenlie imbarked in that vnreco∣uerable mischiefe of debt. In counsell it is the greatest ex∣cellency (and in many natures rather to be wished then hoped for) to pre∣ferre the opportunitie of time before the suggestion of disdaine, to mode∣rate deseignes according to the ad∣uerse, or prosperous winde of occa∣sion, to serue time and not obstinat∣lie wrestle with foule weather, but like an experienced Pilotte put into some harbor till the cleared skie pro∣mise a more secure passage. But wee must not betake our selues to those remedies, which doe rather declare the greatnes of danger, then redresse
the inconueniences, neither must we thinke in great deliberations to a∣uoide all inconueniences: for it is impossible that in this worlde one thing be ingendred without the cor∣ruption of another, and euery com∣moditie is vnfortunatelie annexed to some discommoditie, But let vs remember Rade volte aduien, che ad alte imprese Fortuna ingiuriosa non contrasti. Slow counselles are fitte rather to preserue then encrease a state, spee∣dy and quicke doe rather encrease then preserue: Agendo, audendoque res Romana creuit. But in cases of exigencie, the worst course is to bee gouerned by middle counselles, nei∣ther to be cautelous sufficiently in prouiding, nor earnest enough in executing. But as mines if they be secretly made, produce wonderfull effects, o∣therwise endamage more then they auaile: so counsels if they be wrap∣ped vp in silence, are very fortunate∣ly powerfull in ciuill actions, but
diuulgated loose their force, when the other partie hath time to fru∣strate their ends. The way to keep a thing priuate is to acquainte no body with it: Those things which are knowne one∣lie to ourselues, cannot be common, those thinges which are imparted to another cannot be secret. No man but hath some friend, whose fidelitie he holdeth so assured that hee may safelie entrust him with his nearest touching secrete, and hee presently will with equall confidence to ano∣ther disclose, till at length it be gene∣rally known. And how can a man exact that faith in another, which he hath vio∣lated in himselfe? or how require si∣lence when hee hath not performed it? or what indiscretion is it by o∣pening to another to enter a volun∣tary seruitude, and to liue awed, lest we discontent him? But in commit∣ting any secrets to another, we must imitate those, who in trying a new vessel, first proue it with water, be∣fore
they trust it with wine. There is nothing more contra∣ry to this qualitie, then the passion of anger, which a man ought especi∣allie to moderate, by empyring o∣uer his affections, and triumphing in commaunding himselfe to for∣giue in such sorte, that it breake not out into wordes, specially against those, who stand able to iustifie thē∣selues in the full of reputation: Those men, (which as Cosmo saide) carry their heart in their mouth, are rather to be pitied then feared, their threat∣ninges seruing for no other end, the to arme him that is threatned. The chiefest rules of Wisedome are these▪ To prouide against the be∣ginnings of euill: for disorders at the first little gather strength in tract of time, euen as insensible vapors bring forth horrible tempestes: But whn the euill doth exceede power of resistance, it is best by timing and discreet waiting to expect opportu∣nitie, for thinges in time receaue contrary reuolutions, and conclude
cleane different from their first appa∣rance and likelihoode. To continue in action and mena∣ging of matters: for new businesses arise out of the former, both by rea∣son of the coherency and way, that one open to another, and als by the authoritie which is regained by be∣ing engaged in the handling of thē: Casr at his first rising into great ex∣pectation, would not suffer any matters of moment to passe at Rome, without his participation and no∣tice, insomuch that euen no conspi∣racy or matter of innouation coulde happen but hee was an agent: For he was a party in the combination of Crassus and his companies, of Cai∣t Ps and of Cateline. But to bee interessed in many businesses of con¦sequence at one time, doth deuide a man, and cause him to make imper∣fect offers, and reuerse thinges be∣fore they be perfected. To accompany all actions with a good colour, for many (quibus mag∣no vinos per ambitionem est imare mo∣est)
not able to see into thinges them∣selues, will make iudgement by the circumstances. To auoide suddaine chaunges: for that doth hold of violence, and violence doth seldome sorte to anie prosperous ends. To preferre the present state, before innouations, and that which is it in turbido: for this is nothing else but to account rather of certainety, then incertainety, rather of thinges easie and safe, then magnificent and dangerous. Not to giue sufferance to the first wrongs: for that breedeth pro∣per derogation: Such vnworthy tollerations inspire the party wih boldnesse, and are (as it were) pullies to draw on iniuries: but to call thinges into correction, preser∣ueth authoritie. To dissemble according to the apparances and fashions of the time: Tiberius gloried in nothing so much as his cunning in cloaking his pur∣poses with faire pretences, and go∣ing
inuisibly, in which surely he was excellent. To settle more assurance in him, that expecteth, thē in him who hath receiued a benefite: for by speeding in sutes, men become slacke waiters, when hope of honor and gaine (the onely soueraigne meane to conserue men in due deuotion) shall be satis∣fied. To be wiselie diffident, and put on a iudiciall distrust: Put on I say because there is nothing lesse famili∣ar, and easie to honest men then to suspect: for they thinke the strength of vertue in another, whereof they finde the foundation in themselues, for it is very true that men most fair∣ly conditioned are of the first impres∣sion & apt to be trained into errors: but such as are practised in wicked∣nes, goo alway armed against the like. To suspect causlesly in steade of imagined wrong, returneth an effectuall iniurie, and many haue in∣uited their friendes to deceiue them while too iniuriously their fidelity is
called in question. To despise iniuries of honour nobly, and with an highnes of mind: for contume lies not regarded vanish of themselues into obliuion, but re∣pined at, argue a guiltie conscience, Men enuious (desiring to perish ra∣ther with their owne vices, then bee saued by anothers vertue) are ready to diminish the reputation of a more worthier: But the best aunswere to their slaunders is to aunswere no∣thing, and so to steward the effectes of reuenge, as if the aduersary were rather to bee contemptuously pitti∣ed, then reckoned of: or rather a man must endeuour by doing well to authorise an ill opinion of them. For as enuie is the shadowe of ver∣tue: So when vertue shall come to that perfection, as to reueale it selfe to the worlde, then like the verticall sunne it abateth all sha∣dowes, which the low creeping ob∣ietions of detraction can stirre. In suffering thinges of this qualitie is shewed the greaest force and mag∣naminitie,
and a sure confidence in vertue: Let vs remember that an honest and wise man can no way be dishonoured: that it is an excel∣lent and diuine commendation, Ab ditione mala non timeba. To qualifie enuie (which vn∣doubtedlie will arise in men of no action, in sufficiencie being very ap∣prehensiue) the best course is to at∣tribute the successes rather to faelici∣tie thn vertue. Therefore Sylla to suppresse any such humors, as preiudiciall to his rising and great∣nes, referred the honour of his ex∣ploites to the speciall grace of For∣tune, and the better to encrease that opinion oftentimes auerred, that enterprises hazarded according to the suddaine occasion, better pros∣pered with him, then those which by good aduise hee determined of. Enuie also hath no force when it appeareth, that the actions are directed rather to vertue, then to
fame. Great Fortunes hauing at∣chieued matters worthy themselues, must not ambitiousely seeke cere∣monies, nor abuse the prsperous endes to vanitie of Speech: but by auoiding popular meetinges, by moderating the rumor of deserte, they must beginne, -Otium & somnum loqus, and excuse them∣selues from entering into any acti∣ons of the like qualitie, but in such sort, that neither through the motion of worldlie appetite, and ambition, they seeke to embrace more then is conueniēt, nor throgh too many suspitions, and too-much incredulity, they de∣priue themselues of great occasi∣ons.
Essay. 15 Of Reputation. REputation is a com∣mon conceit of extra∣ordinary vertue ac∣quired not by the mul¦titude, but by the gret∣nes of actes, by so stewarding a mans seasonable endeuours, as that which is done may be apprehended, as rare, singular, great, without pa∣ragon, admirable. Small vertues & of ordinary excellency winne both trust and loue: for the vnderstan∣ding presently finding in them a de∣gree of worthines, moueth the will to embrace them: but great vertues drawing with them a certaine diuine
competencie and greatnes, so amuse the intellectuall part in contempla∣tion of their vale, that the affecti∣on of loue is excluded as not able to honor, when the mind is neuer sa∣tisfied in admiring. Those actions doe chiefely set∣tle this impression, which proceede from a discreete despising of those thinges, which the common sense of worldlinges apprehendeth to be de∣sired: as to refraine from those lust∣full affections, into which humaine imbecilitie is prone to seduce the most restrayned imagination: or to resolue against death, and rather in∣counter the most hideous formes of daunger, then ouercome by any vn∣iust aduantages: or by commanding ouer all priuate interestes, by forget∣ting all naturall affections, when they stand not with an higher vertue: So Scipio by offering no dishonour or violence to that faire damsel Allu∣cius his Spouse: So Fabritius in re∣turning the traytorous Phisitian to his deserued punishment, So Manli∣us
by performing exemplary iustice vpon his sole sonne, obtained this esteeme, and a loue mixed with au∣thoritie. Surely that action impor∣ted a wonderfull temper of mind, & an absolute victory of those passions which in such cases wold ouersweigh the best grounded resolution: For euen Aeneas himself, in whome mag∣nanimitie doth shine through all mi∣stie fearefulnes, hauing with a secure brauerie of mind, passed multitudes of his enemies, yet when hee hath ta∣ken charge of his Father, and his son , hee findeth himselfe disarmed of that vertuous indifferency, fearing their feare, quaking at euery shadow, Et pariter comiti{que}, onerique ti∣mentem. To confirme our minds in this despisingnes, wee must direct our course to attaine the Hauen, and quiet of a good conscience, accoun∣ting all other thinges in no other proportion, then as the windes and tempestes, which would remoue vs from this determination, by for∣cing
vs with a weake dispaire, and coward hating of life to retire into the harbor of idlenes: we must remē∣ber to accustome our thoughtes to expectation of troubles, to receiue them with no perturbation, to rule ouer Fortune, to thinke her nothing if humaine ignorance and imbecili∣tie did not deifie her, if our vaine ambitions and disordinate concupi∣cences did not arme her in that vsur∣pation of reasons seignory: we must seeke true felicitie in the center of the minde, and not in the circumfe∣rence of worldlie thinges, which are subiect to continuall reuolution: for that is to giue our selues a praye to those alterarions, which follow the interchaunge of faire and contrarie accidents: wee must know, that as we are compounded of an heauenlie, and earthy substance, so our care must bee to prouide for the good of the better parte, and for the bodie but in a lower degree, as the in∣strument of the soule. And as wee must not contemne in this life, fame,
honor, wealth, friendes, and those thinges which in the deceiuable stile of appetite are called goods, and attributed to fortune, but by honest meanes endeuour their fruition, as thinges good or bad according to the vse: so wee must not delight in them for themselues, nor bee troub∣led in suffering their priuation, nor out of an humor of confidence pro∣uoke miseries: Ascanius in a youth∣full brauerie, Optat aprum, aut fuluum descen∣dere monte leonem: But that desire proceedeth from a not well guided (but yet excusable) heate of vnripe yeares: Wee per∣forme our deuoires, if void of feare (the onely thing to bee feared) wee so tollerate vnauoidable mischiefes, that they neither disturbe reason, nor driue the minde to vnrest: other∣wise as a feauer doh hinder the ope∣ratiōs of the bodie, so sorrow sprin∣ging from these chaunces (if it bee not moderated) disquieteth reason,
admitteth many corrupt & disdain∣ful inclinations, subiecteth the mind to infinite defections, and stayeth the execution of great and worthie actions. This aptresse of resolution, or of disposing a mans inward selfe, is waited on with valour and wisedom which are the two most principal pil¦lers of Reputation, not onely in re∣spect of their coherency in the same manner, as the eye and the hand, but because they rather come of a bene∣fite of nature, then intente & choice (the one proceeding from a readi∣nesse of witte, the other from a pre∣sence and courage of minde) draw∣ing with them in a kinde of dependē∣cie these heroicall vertues, magna∣nimitie, patronage of iustice against all oppressions and magnificence. O∣ther vertues of meekenes, humanity and courtesie, in ministring to the wantes of men, in preferring them to places of honour, in redeeming the offendor from the rigor of the law, doe stirre affection: but these
ertues, if the common weale bee a partie in enioying them; win admi∣ration. The actions which chieflie reueale them are victories in the fielde beyonde expectation, surpri∣singes of Cities, erections of statelie houses for common vses, graue and fortunate counsailing the State, dis∣creete discharging of Embassa∣ges. To the obtayning this opinion, must concurre two other helping causes, as specially remarkable in greate Fortunes: first Nobilitie, for if the auncesters were men of valour, and eminency in vertue, the vulgar ort (out of a true loue to men of de∣ferr) will preoccupie the same con∣ceite of their issue. Secondlie con∣uersation, which if it be among men worthy, presentlie argueth a likenes in maners, to the people which see nothing but apparances and maketh iudgement by that which is subiect to fight, thinking a man so qualified  those with whome he doth enfe∣lowship.
But these reasons, although they are of great consequence, yet are doubtfull, and the expectation is weakelie gounded vpon opinion onelie, which presently chaungeth, except it bee established by some o∣uert action, which may bee worthie themselues both for difficultie of accomplishing and sucessefull end. Those thinges which are done in youth (because this age is not one∣lie not enuied, but also fauoured) are of great moment in giuing life to the opinion of the worlde, and in nourishing such presumptions, as confirmed by some great and noble exploite, may suddenly growe into this actuall reputation. Therefore in Rome the young men of greatest hope did eyther preferre some lawe in behalfe of the people, or put law∣breakers in sute (a thing as Plutark sayeth, pleasing the people as much as to see a notable course of a dogge at an haire) or which is more com∣mendable, defended the innocn
of the oppressed against the iniuri∣ous ntreaties of the powerable and great ones, (as Ciceroes patronizing of Rosciu at so vnripe yeares, nd with such libertie of speech against the potency of proud Sylla, was the first steppe to the possibility of his greatnes,) Or did some thing which might moue talke and become Fa∣bula vulgi through the whole Cittie, as Manlius his rescue of his Father from the Tribunes, or Caesrs dealing in compounding the ciull dissenti∣ons of Pompey and Crassus, by shew∣ing them, that their mutual depres∣sions serued for nothing, but to in∣crease the authority of their enemi∣es, and arme a third with ht credit, which now remayned inuiolable in themselues: This action argued a witte farre ouergoing the greennesse of his age, and was the first moouer of the peoples affectiō towards him: for what is more honourable then to treate in according two so noble personages, which had liued so long in separation. But because an opi∣nion
thus obtained must bee fed by the like meanes, or else vanisheth as soone as it appeares to the worlde: This cōmendation must be accoun∣ted in no other measure, but as an incouragement to doe better, or as the aire, which maketh men grow vp in vertue, and quickneth the appetite to enterprise thinges of high deser∣uing prayse. For preseruing Reputation is re∣quired Religion, and (that concur∣rance of deuine vertue) felicity: When the opiniō of being religious is esta∣blished, it seemeth that all other ver∣tues must follow of necessitie, and by it all suspitions of any vetie, or lacke of vertue are silenced. But here wee must auoide two rockes, super∣stition, and dissimulation: In the one is small wisedom, because these bugbeares, and Chimeraes of opi∣nion, render a man vncapable of weightie matters, idle, contemptu∣ous, vainely fearefull, simple and o∣pen to be practised vpō by al deceit¦fulnes: In the other appeareth great
crat, and when zeale is put on, as a pretext to palliate wickednes, it bringeth such Nullifidians to bee o∣dious, suspected and abhorred by the common consent of men: and there∣fore it is best to bee sociall in shew, but precise in effect: to keepe God sparinglie in our mouth, but aboun∣dantly in our heart. The workes which chiefly beto∣ken a man religious are, to appre∣hende, to aduance the Ministerie, to prouide for those, who doe not in plausible formes preach themselues, but despising such a pompous and malepert manner breath grace and truth: to furnish them with suffici∣ent liuings, because there is nothing which more impaireth the reuerence due to that profession, then needi∣nesse. Concerning felicitie, some men are borne vnder a propitious a∣spect of heauen, or rather fauoured with diuine grace, which guideth their actions vnder a continual pro∣tection of good lucke▪ These men
bringing their deseignes to prospe∣rous issues, are thoughte of  iuement and valour equall for the accomplishment of the like, and as the Comedient sayeth, -Exinde eos sapere omnes di∣cimus, While not considering the weake∣nes and imperfections of their counsels, wee make iudgement by the euent. The chiefe Rules to maintain Reputation are these: To haue more deedes then wordes, rather doing thinges worthy to bee spoken, then speaking thinges worthy to bee done: To auoide wordes of vaun∣ting or brauerie, and in relations to bee reserued in selfe commenda∣tions: for fame by suppressing is augmented, and prayse in this re∣sembleth a quaint Dame, which fol∣loweth those that despise her, and flyeth those that follow her: To acknowledge no dependencie, for that is to confesse vncapablenes and defeces: To bee vniforme in life
nd actions, constantly maintaining orde and promse: To attempte hinges within power and feasible: or easilie to giue ouer enterpises mplieth eyther small iudement in ssaying, or a little mine in not rosequting: To neglect smal ac∣ions after the accomplishment of reat▪ for to a Personag of valour here is not a more necesar thing, hen to know the height of his great¦esse. Mrius in not contenting imselfe with the reputation gotten n the Cimbrian warre diminished it y entring into other actions: Not o bee discountenanced in missing ny place, or office: for sometime, uch failing in sutes augmenteth this steeme: Wee may reade of Lamias n Tacitus a Senator of birth & quali¦y, whosuing to be gouernor of Siri was repelled: At non promissa prouin∣ia dignaionem addiderat. he cause was, because the people which is a beholder of the Princes actions, ma∣keth ouerbolde interpretations of them, and ambitiouslie comparing
men of merite, when they finde de∣sert vnacknowledged, presently with presumptuous rashnes conclude the defect in the Prince, and by making it the subiect of their conference, in∣crease his esteem that was disappoin∣ted: for this reason Cato said, that he had rather that the people shoulde enquire why hee had no statue e∣rected to his memory, then why hee had. And againe, I obserue that at the solemnising of Iunias funeralles among the images of twentie noble houses, were left out that of Cassius, her husband and Brutus her brother, to the intent to extinguish their me∣mory: but yet they did shine aboue all the rest for this onely, because their images were not represen∣ted. Moreouer, thinges must bee intrusted to men responsall and suf∣ficient: To vse base and vnable men for instrumentes in executions of weight, doth empaire their credite. No office must bee vndertaken with anie extraordinary opinion▪ For
not aunswering such conceites, (men desiring thinges impossible) doth in time breede infamie. This Reputation once obtay∣ned, workeh a louing feare in the people, (loue stirring their affection, & feare mingling it with authoritie) Loue is the most forcible of all our pssions, and as the principal giueth vigor and motion to the rest: but it is a thing doubtfull and deceaue∣able, in respect of the imperfection of men: for no mam can demeane himselfe with such circumspection, that hee can satisfie and please all, because mens mindes are by nature insatiable, vpon euery accident chan∣ging opinion, inconstant, murmu∣ring for trifling regards, alway disli∣king the present, and preferring thinges of expectation and hope, be∣fore certainety and quietnesse, inso∣much that one fauour, if it bee not e∣quallie giuen to all, but in any grea∣tet proportion measured to one par∣ticular, cleane cancelleth the memo∣ry
of forepassed good turnes: Such is the nature of man, that late bene∣fites are cleane lost if there bee not an hope to receiue more, and al∣though the obligations bee neuer so great, yet one thing denied doth so∣ly possesse the memory, and all our fauors are drowned in forgetfulnes. Feare is a more certain ground, then loue for maintaining authoritie, be∣cause loue is in the power of the lo∣uer, feare in him, that maketh him∣selfe feared: But yet feare procu∣reth hatred, which although it bee dissembled so long as it is vnable to shake off obedience, yet when a grea¦ter force shall vntie that knotte, it will burst out into open contest∣ing. Now because men easie bring themselues into contempt, men ter∣rible and austere incurre hatred, there is another middle qualitie, which I may eyther call a louing feare, or a reuerencing loue follow∣ing Reputation. This is a conser∣uer
of that obedience and authority, in which men of greate qualitie ought to retaine the multitude: for as the Elementes which otherwise stand at defiance, are by the heauen∣ly Spheares conformed into wel ru∣led motions without violence or enforcement, onely obeyeing the noblenes of their nature: so men shew themselues willing to bee di∣directed by those, who pre∣ceade, and are enobled by an eminency of vertue.
Essay. 16. Of Liberality. SOme receiue and enter∣taine fauorites with kind gestures onely, vnmeasu∣rable in promises, but spare in ministring to their wantes, whome I may fitly compare to some fruites, which by a lushious smell, & delightfull colour inuite a man to eate, but proue vnsauory & distast∣full. They that are the dispensers of Gods temporall graces must ap∣ply themselues to find out men of an honest and exemplarie life & to ac∣knowledge their desert, Vt non sit tantum ex conscientia merces.

The rewardes of goodnes, or vice frame mē accordingly: few are of so iudiciall a wit, as they measure ver∣tue for the inner peace and content∣ment, and not according to successe: others seeing the guerdon due to merit, abused in maintaining wicked¦nes, thinke to obtaine by the same meanes, and fashion themselues ac∣cordinglie, and when euill men re∣ceiue fauour and place (besides the iniurie done to vertue) Had facile quisquam gratuito bonus est: Libera∣litie
thus employed in fauouring good wittes, in nourishing artes, in quickning those lifefull seedes of goodnsse, in inuiting men to surpas themselues, is the only vetue, whh ouercommeth enuie, and breedh regarde euen in our enemies: for men learned once endeared by an obligation, as the heades and or∣rulers of the common opinio of the worlde, binde all other men to reue∣rence their patron, and by sweete commemoration of receiued bene∣sites winne them to patterne them∣selues to their courses, as the onelie hopefull ends to rise by. This vertue must be naturall & amongst those thinges which cannot bee imputed to election, and exerci∣sed with delight to doe good: when it is encouraged by a grateful return of hoped gaine, it is nothing but a base kind of counterchange & mar∣chandizing; It resembleth the di∣uine nature, which communicateth to all, and expecteth no future ad∣uantages:
and although the vse of this vertue is swete, when a man findeth the eturne of thankfulnesse, yet Liberalitatem clriorem ingratus debitor facit: it is more noble when it findeth the repayment of ingratitude: Discretion must go∣uerne this vertue, otherwise the ra∣ces which are virgins will turne whores: Followers ought to bee countenanced both in their owne sutes, and also in the requestes of their familiars: for as apparrell at first colde, receiuing heate from vs, conserueth our bodies with the heate, wee haue giuen it, so the Ministers or attendantes of a greate state, being aduanced by their pa∣tron, increase his reputation and power ablenes: But they must not bee ouer importune, or vrge oftner then is conuenient: For so they become like the Iue, which by an ouer hard embracing hindereth the growing of the oake. It is good also to bee reserued in giuing to those,
who quicksighted in spying secret dis¦likes, will make vse of such occasi∣ons, and by multiplying suspitions, winde themselues into fauour, by working a more worthier into disgrace: These men know no o∣ther habites but auarice, selfeseeking contempt of others, and an high e∣steeme of their own vnworthinesse. It is a difficult thing to sound their hollow dispositions, and cauterized consciences, but the best notes to know them by are these. They haue no conformitie with themselues, now commending, anone discom∣mending the same thing, taking or putting of a person, as the time or place shall require: they neuer stand well affected with men of their own rancke or societie, but if they loue any, they must be Great men, It is an infallible signe of a crooked nature, (as Cicero sayeth,) to seeme affected to none but to Praetors.
