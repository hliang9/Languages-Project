A CONFESSION OF FAITH Of seven Congregations or Chur∣ches of Christ in LONDON, which are commonly (but uniustly) called Anabaptists. PUBLISHED For the vindication of the Truth, and informati∣on of the ignorant; likewise for the taking off of those aspersions which are frequently both in Pulpit and Print unjustly cast upon them. But this I confesse unto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I the God of my Fathers, beleeving all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets, and have hope towards God, which they them∣selves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of dead both of the just and unjust. Acts 24. 14, 15. For we cannot but speak the things that we have seen and heard, Acts 4. 20. If I have spoken evill, bear witnesse of the evill; but if well, why smitest thou me? John 18. 23. Blessed are yee when men revile you, and say all manner of evill against you falsly for my sake. Rejoyce, &c. Matth. 11. 12. & 19. 29. The second Impression corrected and enlarged. Published according to Order. London printed by Matth. Simmons, and are to be sold by John Hancock in Popes-head Alley. 1646.
TO THE RIGHT HONO∣rable the Lords, Knights, Citi∣zens and Burgesses in Parliament assembled. Right Honorable and most Noble Patriots, IN as much as there hath been a Doctor Feat∣leys Book de∣dicated to the Parliament. Book lately presented unto you, in whose Dedicatory Epistle there are many hainous accusations un∣justly and falsly laid against us, we conceived it necessary to make some declaration of our innocency, and (to the end) humbly to present unto your view this our Confession of Faith: Here wee unfainedly de∣clare, what in our hearts wee judge, and what wee teach, and according to this Rule wee desire and endevour, through the grace of God, to lead our lives. This Confession of our Faith we send forth to speak the truth for us, and so to make our inno∣cency to appeare; desiring that the same light may guide others also to the same way of truth and of obedience both to God and to the Magistrate, who
is the Minister of God to us for good. We hope your Honours will permit us to speak with mo∣desty in our just defence. And when any shal pro∣voke you to lift up a hand against us, wee desire you may seriously consider Gamaliels counsel in Acts 5. We take no thought for our selves, for the Lord our God is al-sufficient; but wee desire and pray that you may doe nothing against Christ, neither in his members, nor in his ordinances, that there may be no wrath upon you from the Lord, but that you knowing the innocent and protecting them according to the wil of God, may for the same be famous unto all generations, and the memoriall of your names may be pretious among the Saints till the coming of King Iesus.
❧ To the judicious and impartiall READER. COURTEOVS READER; IT is no wonder if it seeme strange to thee, that wee should publish a confession of our faith, who are frequently termed to be Heretiques and Schismatiques, and what not, though unjustly; neither is it any discouragement unto us, though this sect (as they call the Anabaptists) is Acts 28. 22. every where spoken against, and in that we are charg∣ed (for Christs Name sake) with the same things our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Apostles were accused of; it's a mercy, an honour, and a comfort unto us, when we remember what our Lord hath said unto us, Blessed are ye when Mat 5. 11, 12. men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evill falsly, for my sake; Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the Prophets that were be∣fore you. The Disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord; it's enough for the Disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the Master of the house Mat. 10. 24, 25 Belzebub, how much more shall they call them of his houshold? If the world hate you, yee know that it hated me before it hated you: if yee were of the world, the world would love her owne, but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therfore the world hateth you. The servant is not greater then the Lord; if Joh. 15. 18, 19, 20, 21. See Acts 21. 28. 30, 31. & 14. 22. 2 Tim. 3. 12. 1 Pet. 4. 13. they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you, &c. All these things will they doe unto you for my Names sake, because they know not him that sent me; Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Je∣sus shall suffer persecution; but rejoyce in as much as yee are parta∣kers of Christs sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, yee may be clad also with exceeding joy. Our Lord Jesus was accused to be a sedtious and mutinous fellow: Luk. 23. 25. Paul was called a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition, and a ring-leader Acts 24. 1. 5. 6 of the sect of the Nazarens; Saying, Away with such a fellow, Acts 18. 13.
for it is not fit he should live; Saying, This fellow perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the Law: and our Lord Jesus Christ was ac∣cused of perverting the people, and forbidding to give tribute to Cae∣sar; Luk. 23. 2. 14. Mat. 15. 1. to 9 and that he and his Disciples did teach novelties, and brake the traditions of the Elders. Christ was accused to have a Devill, and to Joh. 10. 20. Act. 26. 24, 25 Act. 17. 18, 19. Mark. 14. 64. be mad, saying to the people, Why doe yee heare him? Paul was esteemed to be mad: also they said, What will this babler say? And that he taught new doctrine: and Christ was accused to speake blasphemy, and they all condemned him to be guilty of death. So some are offended at us for meeting in houses to preach, and would have us punished for it; not∣withstanding, it was Christ and his Apostles practice to doe so, whose exam∣ple we are to follow. Christ taught upon a mountaine, and in a ship. Mat. 5. 1. 2. & 13. 2. Acts 20. 20. Act. 1. 13. 15, 16 & 2. 2. Act. 16. 13, 14. Act. 20. 7, 8, 9. Act. 28. 30, 31. Paul preached from house to house; also the Church met together in an upper roome, where Peter preached; and Paul preached, and conver∣ted Lydia by the River side; the Disciples met together in the night in an upper roome; Paul preached two yeares in an hired house, and received all that came unto him. If he had lived in these dayes and done so, it's to be feared some would have petitioned against him: So some accuse us to be disturbers of the peace of the Common-wealth; yet all that know us can testifie for us, that wee meet together and depart in a peaceable man∣ner: And from Acts 17. 5, 6, 7. it will appeare, what persons they were that disturbed the publick peace, it's fit such persons should be taken notice of and accordingly punished. So we are blamed, because we frequent not their Temples; we dare not Acts 7. 48. trust in lying words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of Act. 17. 24, 25. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 6. 3. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Joh. 4. 20. &c. the Lord are these; we know the most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands; and that wee are the Temple of the living God; and that our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost; and that Christs Church is not built with dead stones. And because there are but a few of us, some conceive we are in an error, and that the least number should yeeld to the greater; then it seemes, if the number of the Papists or Atheists Acts 14. 16. Exod. 23. 2. 1 King. 22. 6, 7, &c. exceed the number of the Protestants, they must forsake their Religion. God in times past suffered all Nations to walke in their own wayes; there was but one true Prophet to 400 false. After three yeares preaching and working miracles by Christ, there was but a small number. Christ cals his, Acts 1. 14, 15. Luk. 12. 32. Mat. 7. 13, 14. Rev. 13. 7. 16. 17. a little flocke: the Scripture declares the greatest number followed after the beast. Also those that preach amongst us, are esteemed as the Apostles were, to be unlearned and ignorant men. Apollo was instructed more perfectly in the way of God by Aquila, a tradesman, and Priscilla his Acts 4. 13. Acts 18. 1, 2, 3. 26
wife: but the Scripture saith; As every man hath received the gift, 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. See 1 Cor. 14. 3. 26. 31. even so minister the same one to another, as good Stewards of the ma∣nifold grace of God. Also some say of us, that wee be of severall sects, and Luke 23. 12. Ioh. 9. 22. See 1 Cor. 1. 10, 11. that wee cannot agree among our selves. Pilate and Herod agreed together to crucifie Christ; wee dare not agree as the Jewes did that if any did confesse that Jesus was the Christ, he should be put out of the Syna∣gogue. The union Christ prayed for, we desire, and for such an agreement as Iohn 17. 21. agreeth not with the truth, we may not agree unto, therefore we desire it not; yet the Paedobaptists differ more among themselves then we doe, and if this Eph. 4. 3. to 17. their reason have any strength in it, it is against themselves: the severall sects of Paedobaptists, be Papists, Arrians, Nestorians, Pelagians, Do∣natists, Eutychians, Grecians, Lutherans, Arminians, Episcopans, Ni∣colaties, Calvinists, Zuinglians, Hussites, and above twenty other severall sects, which are all baptizers of infants, and notwithstanding, for other points, are all asunder, and have all rent one from another, therefore we send Mat. 7. 3, 4, 5. them to follow the counsell of Christ. As the Watchmen dealth with the Spouse of Christ, in her seeking her be∣loved, Song 3. 2. 5. with 5, 6, 7. so they deale with us, they finding us out of that common and broad way themselves walke in, they smite us, and take away our vaile, and vaile us with reproaches, and odious names; to incense all, both good and bad, a∣gainst us, that wee may appeare vile in the eyes and hearts of all that behold us, or shall heare of us, which they indeavour to doe, both in Pulpit and print, Acts 16. 19. not fearing to charge us, with holding free-will, falling from grace, denying election, originall sin, childrens salvation, the old Testament, and mens pro∣prietie in their estates, and censuring all to be damned that are not of our judgement and practice; all which wee disclaime, because they are untrue. And as for the other things, whereof wee are accused, wee referre those who desire further satisfaction to the answers of them In a small Treatise, in∣tituled, Briest Considerations on Dr Featly his Book, inti∣tuled, Tho dip∣per dipt, by Samuel Ri∣chardson.: yet by reason of the ma∣ny accusations that are cast upon us, although they cannot prove the things whereof we are accused, yet the generalitie of the people are incensed against us, and are incouraged, and set on by such, to seek out the place of our meet∣ings, which are the more private, not because they are private, but because wee have not any more publicke places; but if any shall please to procure us more larger places to meet in, wee are willing to imbrace them with thank∣fulnesse and joy, although no man should speak for us to those in an thoritie, from whom one word were enough to protect us, from the violence we should be subject unto; but as it was then, Acts 17. 5, 6, 7. so it is now; yet must Act 17. 5, 6, 7. wee beare all the blame; but our God will in his time cleare our innocency, al∣though now many stand looking upon us as a people (holding such things) not
worthy to live, and are in danger by the rude multitude gathering together to stone us: and had it been against our persons onely, we would have held our peace, and committed our cause to God; but considering it is the truth that we professe that suffers, we may not, nor dare not be neuters in matters of so high a nature, but come in and speak to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Therefore to free our selves, and the truth we profess, from such unjust asper∣sions, that it may be at liberty, though we be in bonds, wee have published a briefe confession of our Faith, (which we conceive most void of contention in these sad and troublesome times) the thoughts of our hearts as in the presence of God wee here declare, that it may appeare to the consciences of them that feare God, what wrong we suffer from some who have ability to cast mists, Jude 14. 15. and dark clouds, which overshadow the glory of the truth, and them that professe it. And although they acknowledge with us, that the truth is not fully discovered, yet they will tie all future discovery to a former light, and con∣ceive they doe well in so doing. But God will by his truth shew their error, and exalt Jesus Christ the chiefe corner-stone, which the builders so much re∣ject. And lest this should be thought to be the judgement of some particular persons, this is done by the consent and appointment of seven Congregations or Churches in London, with the names of some of each of them subscribed in the behalfe of the whole. And although wee bee distinct in our meetings, for conveniency; yet are we one in faith, fellowship, and communion, holding Jesus Christ for our Head & Law-giver, under whose Rule and government we desire to walke, and to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth, that when our Lord and King shall call us to account, we may be found ready and wor∣thy to be received into our Masters joy. Ʋntill which time we desire to spend these few dayes we have here to remain, to the glory of God, the honour of the Gospel, the Saints comfort, and our Countries good, to our own account at the great day when Christ shall come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on 2 Thess. 1. 8. them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Subscribed by us in the behalfe of seven Congregations or Churches of Christ in London. As also by a French Congregation of the same judgement. . Thomas Gunne. John Mabbit. . Thomas Munden.

A CONFESSION OF FAITH of seven Congregations or Chur∣ches of Christ in London, which are commonly (though unjustly) called ANABAPTISTS. I. THe Lord our God is but 1 Cor. 8. 6. Esay 44. 6. Chap. 46. 9. one God, whose Exod. 3. 14. subsistence is in himselfe; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but him∣selfe; who only hath immortalitie, 1 Tim. 6. 16. dwel∣ling in the light which no man can ap∣proach unto; who is in himselfe most Esay 43. 15. holy, every way Psal. 147. 5. infinite, in Deut. 32. 3. greatnesse, Job 36. 5. wisdome, Jer. 10. 12. power, love; Exod. 34. 6, 7. mercifull and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodnesse and truth, who giveth Acts 17. 28. Rom. 11. 36. being, moving, and preservation to all creatures. II. In this divine and infinite being, there is the 1 Cor. 1. 33 Father, the John 1. 1. Word, and the Chap. 15. 26 holy Spirit, each having the whole divine Exod. 3. 14. essence, yet the essence undivided; all infinite without any beginning, therefore but 1 Cor. 8. 6. one God, who is not to be divided in nature, and being, but distinguished by severall peculiar relative properties. III. God hath Esa. 46. 10. Ephes. 1. 11. Rom. 11. 33. decreed in himselfe before the world was concerning all things, Psal. 115. 3. & 135. 6. whether necessary, Psal. 33. 15. 1 Sam. 10. 9. 26. Pro. 21. 6. Exod. 21. 13. Pro. 16. 33. Psal. 144. Esa. 45. 7. Jer. 14. 22. Mat. 6. 28. 30. Col. 1. 16, 17. Nu. 23. 19, 20 Rom. 3. 4. Jer. 10. 10. Eph. 1. 4, 5. Jud. 4. 6. Pro. 16. 4. accidentall or voluntary, with all the circumstances of them, to worke, dispose, and bring about all things according to
the counsell of his own will, to his glory: (yet without being the Author of sin, or having fellowship with any therein) in which appeares his wisdome in disposing all things, unchangeablenesse, power, and faithfulnesse in accomplishing his decree: and God hath before the foundation of the world, foreordained some men to eternall life, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of his grace; leaving the rest in their sin to their just condemnation, to the praise of his justice. IV. In the Gen. 1. 1. Col. 1. 16. Esa. 45. 12. beginning God made all things very good; created man after his own 1 Cor. 15. 45, 46. image, filled with all meet perfection of nature, and free from all sin; but Eccles. 7. 29. long he abode not in this honour, Satan using the subtilty of the Gen. 3. 1. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 11. 3. Serpent to seduce first Eve, then by her seducing Adam; who without any compulsion, in eating the forbidden fruit, 1 Tim. 2. 14. transgressed the command of God, and fell, where∣by Gal. 3. 22. death came upon all his posterity, who now are con∣ceived in sin, and by nature the children of wrath, the ser∣vants of sin, the subjects of Rom. 5. 12. 18, 19. Chap. 6. 22. Ephes. 2. 3. death, and other miseries in this world, and for ever, unlesse the Lord Jesus Christ set them free. V. God in his infinite Job 38. 11. power and wisdome, doth Esa. 46. 10, 11. Eccles. 3. 14. dis∣pose all things to the end for which they were created, that neither good nor evill befals any by chance, or with∣out his Mat. 10. 29, 30. Exod. 21. 13. Pro. 16. 33. providence; And that whatsoever befals the Elect, is by his appointment, for his glory, and their Rom. 8. 28. good. VI. All the Elect being Jer. 31. 2. loved of God with an everlast∣ing love, are Ephes. 1. 3. 7. Chap. 2. 4. 9. 2. Thes. 5. 9. redeemed, quickned, and saved, not by themselves, nor their owne workes, lest any man should boast, but onely and wholly by God, of his free Acts 13. 38. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Ier. 9. 23, 24. grace
and mercy through Jesus Christ, who is made unto us by God, 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31 Ier. 23. 6. wisdome, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption, and all in all, that he that rejoyceth, might rejoyce in the Lord. VII. And Ioh. 17. 3. Heb. 5. 9. this is life eternall, that we might know him the onely true God, and Jesus Christ whom hee hath sent. And 1 Thes. 1. 8. Ioh. 6. 36. on the contrary, the Lord will render vengeance in flaming fire, to them that know not God, and obey not the Gospell of Jesus Christ. VIII. The rule of this knowledge, faith, and obedience, concerning the worship of God, in which is contained the whole duty of man, is (not Col. 2. 23. Mat. 15. 9. 6. mens lawes, or unwrit∣ten traditions, but) onely the word of God contained in the holy Ioh. 5. 39. 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. Scriptures, in which is plainly recorded whatsoever is needfull for us to know, beleeve, and pra∣ctise, which are the onely rule of holinesse and obedi∣ence Esa. 8. 20. Gal. 1. 8, 9. Acts 3. 22, 23. for all Saints, at all times, in all places to bee ob∣served. IX. The Lord Jesus Christ, of whom Gen. 3. 15. Chap. 22. 18. & 49. 10. Dan. 7. 13. & 9. 24, 25, 26. Moses and the Prophets wrote, the Apostles preached, hee is the Pro. 8. 23. Iohn 1. 1, 2, 3. Heb. 1. 8 Son of God, the brightnesse of his glory, &c. by whom hee made the world, who upholdeth and governeth all things that he hath made; who also when the Gal. 4. 4. d Heb. 7. 14. Rev. 5. 5. with Gen. 49. 9, 10. Rom. 1. 3. & 9. 10. Matth. 1. 16 with Luke 3. 23. 26. Heb. 2. 16. Isa: 53. 3, 4, 5. Heb. 4. 15. fulnesse of time was come, was made of a woman, of the Tribe of Judah, of the seed of Abraham and David; to wit, of the virgin Mary, the holy Spirit coming down upon her, the power of the most High over-shadowing her, and he was also tempted as we are, yet within sin. X. 1 Tim. 8. 5. Heb. 9. 15. Iohn 14. 6 Jesus Christ is made the Mediator of the new and everlasting Covenant of grace between God and Man,
ever to be Isa. 9. 6, 7. perfectly and fully the Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church of God for evermore. XI. Unto this office he was appointed by Prov. 8. 23. Isa. 42. 6. & 49. 15 God from ever∣lasting, and in respect of his manhood, from the womb called, separated, and Isa. 11. 2, 3, 4, 5. & 61. 1, 2. with Luke 4. 17, 22. Iohn 1. 14. 16. & 3. 34. anointed most fully and abundant∣ly with all gifts necessary, God having without measure powred out his Spirit upon him. XII. Concerning his Mediatorship, the Scripture holds forth Christs call to his office: For Heb. 5 4, 5, 6. none takes this honour upon him, but he that is called of God as was Aaron, it being an action of God, whereby a speciall promise being made, he ordains his Son to this office; which promise is, that Christ should be made a sacrifice for sinne, that he should see his Isa. 53. 10 11. seed, and prolong his dayes, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand, Iohn 3. 16. Rom. 8. 32. all of meer free and absolute grace towards Gods elect, and without any condition foreseene in them to procure it. XIII. This office to bee Mediator, that is, to bee Prophet, 1 Tim 2. 5. Heb. 7. 24. Dan 7, 14. Acts 4. 12. Luke 1. 33. Iohn 14. 6. Priest, and King of the Church of God, is so proper to Christ, that neither in whole, or any part thereof, it cannot be transferred from him to any other. XIV. This office to which Christ is called, is threefold, as Deut. 8. 15, with Acts 3. 22. 23. a Prophet, Heb. 3. 1. & 4. 12. 13. Priest, and Psal. 2. 6. King: this number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our 2 Cor. 5. 20. Acts 26. 18. ignorance, we stand in need of his Propheticall office. And in re∣spect of our great Col. 1. 22 alienation from God, wee need his Priestly office to reconcile us: and in respect of our a∣versnesse and utter inability to return to God, wee need his Kingly office, to Iohn 16 8. convince, Psal. 110. 3 subdue, Cant. 1. 3. Ioh. 6. 44. draw, Phil. 4. 13. up∣hold and 2 Tim. 4. 18. preserve us to his heavenly Kingdome.
XV. Concerning the prophesie of Christ, it is that where∣by hee hath Iohn 1. 18. & 12. 49, 50. & 15. & 17. 8. Deut. 18. 15. revealed the will of God, whatsoever is needfull for his servants to know and Mat. 23. 10. obey; and there∣fore he is called not onely a Prophet and Doctor, and the Heb 3. 1. Apostle of our profession, and the Mal. 3. 1. An∣gel of the covenant, but also the very 1 Cor. 1. 24. Col. 2. 3. wisdome of God, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge, who for ever continueth revealing the same truth of the Gospel to his people. XVI. That hee might bee a Prophet every way compleat, it was necessary hee should bee God, and also that hee John 1. 18. Acts 3. 22, with Deut. 18. 15. Heb. 1, 1 should be man: for unlesse he had been God, he could never have perfectly understood the will of God; and unlesse he had been man, hee could not sutably have un∣folded That Jesus Christ is God, is wonderfull clearly expressed in the Scriptures: he is called, The mighty God, Isa. 9. 6. That Word was God, Joh. 1. 1. Christ who is God over all Rom. 9. 5. God manifested in the flesh, 1 Tim. 3. 16. The same is very God, 1 John 5. 20. He is the first Rev. 1. 8. he gives being to all things, and without him was no∣thing made, John 1. 2. he forgiveth sins, Matth. 9. 6. he is before Abraham Ioh 8. 58. he was and is, and ever will be the same Heb. 13 8. he is alwayes with his to the end of the world, Mat. 28. 20. which could not be said of Iesus Christ, if he were not God. And to the Sonne he saith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, Heb. 1. 8. Iohn 1. 18. Also, Christ is not onely perfectly God, but perfect Man made of a woman, Gal. 4. 4. made of the seed of David, Rom. 1. 3. Coming out of the loyns of David, Acts 2: 30. of Iesse and Iudah, Acts 13. 23. In that the children were partakers of flesh and bloud, hee himselfe likewise took part with them, Heb. 2. 14. he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham, v. 16. So that we are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. Eph. 5. 30 So that, he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one, Heb. 2. 11. See Act. 3. 22. Deut. 18. 15. Heb. 1. 1. it in his own person to men. XVII. Concerning his Iohn 17. 19. Priesthood, Christ having sancti∣fied himselfe, hath appeared once to put away sinne by Heb. 5. 7, 8, 9. & 10. 12. Rom. 5. 19 that one offering of himselfe a sacrifice for sinne, by which he hath fully finished and suffered all things God Eph. 5. 2. Col. 1. 20. Ephes. 2. 14, 15, 16. Rom. 8. 34 required for the salvation of his elect, and removed
all Rites and Shadowes, &c. And is now entred within the vaile into the Holy of Holies, which is the presence Heb. 9. 24. & 8. 1. 1 Pet. 2 5. Ioh. 4. 23, 24. of God. Also, he makes his people a spirituall House, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spirituall Sacrifice ac∣ceptable to God through him. Neither doth the Fa∣ther accept, or Christ offer to the Father any other worship or worshippers. XVIII. This Priesthood was not legall or temporary, but ac∣cording to the order of Heb 7. 17. Melchisedec, and is stable and perfect, not for a Heb. 7. 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25. time, but for ever, which is suteable to Jesus Christ, as to him that ever liveth: Christ was the Priest, Sacrifice and Altar: hee was a Priest accor∣ding to both natures; he was a Sacrifice according to his humane nature; whence in Heb. 5. 6. Scripture it is attributed to his body, to his Heb. 10. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 18. 19. Col. 1. 20. 22. bloud: yet the effectualnesse of this Sa∣crifice did depend upon his divine nature, therefore it is called the bloud of God. Hee was the Altar accor∣ding to his Heb. 9. 13.

Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20. Luke 24. 51, Acts 1. 1. & 5. 30, 31. Iohn 19. 36. Rom. 14. 9. Iohn 5. 26, 27. Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8. & 14. 17. Gal. 5. 22, 23. Mark 1. 27. Heb. 1. 14. Iohn 16. 15. Iob. 1. 8. Rom. 1. 21, 27 18. Eph. 4 17, 18. 2 Pet. 8. Christ being risen from the dead, and ascended into heaven, and having all power in heaven and earth, he doth spiritually governe his Church, and doth exercise his power over all An∣gels and men, good and bad, to the preservation and sal∣vation of the elect, and to the over-ruling and destru∣ction of his enemies. By this Kingly power he applieth the benefits, virtue, and fruits of his Prophesie and Priesthood to his elect, subduing their sinnes, pre∣serving and strengthening them in all their conflicts a∣gainst Satan, the World, and the Flesh, keeping their hearts in faith and filiall feare by his spirit: by this his
mighty power he ruleth the vessels of wrath, using, limi∣ting and restraining them as it seems good to his infi∣nite wisdome. XX. This his Kingly power shall be more fully manifested 1 Cor. 15. 24, 28, Heb. 9. 28. 2 Thess. 1. 9, 10. 1 Thess. 4. 15, 16, 17. Iohn 17, 21, 26. when he shall come in glory to reign among his Saints, when he shall put down all rule and authority under his feet, that the glory of the Father may be perfectly mani∣fested in his Sonne, and the glory of the Father and the Son in all his members. XXI. Jesus Christ by his death did purchase salvation for Ephes. 1. 14. Heb. 5. 9. Mat. 1. 21. Iohn 17. 6. Heb. 7. 25. 1 Cor. 2. 1. Rom. 8. 29, 30. 1 Ioh. 5. 12. Ioh. 15. 13. Ioh. 3. 16. the Elect that God gave unto him: These onely have in∣terest in him, and fellowship with him, for whom he makes intercession to his Father in the behalfe of, and to them alone doth God by his Spirit apply this redemp∣tion unto, as also the free gift of eternall life is given to them, and none else. XXII. Faith is the Ephes. 2. 8, Iohn 6. 29. & 4. 10. Phil. 1. 29. Gal. 5. 22. gift of God, wrought in the hearts of the Elect by the Spirit of God; by which faith they come to know and believe the truth of the Ioh. 17. 17. Heb. 4. 11, 12. Iohn 6. 63 Scriptures, and the excellency of them above all other writings, and all things in the world, as they hold forth the glory of God in his attributes, the excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and of the power and fulnesse of the Spirit in its workings and operations, and so are inabled to cast their soules upon this truth thus believed. XXIII. All those that have this precious faith wrought in Mat. 7. 24, 25. Iohn 13. 10. Iohn 10. 28, 29. them by the Spirit, can never finally nor totally fall a∣way, seeing the gifts of God are without repentance; 1 Pet. 1. 4, 5, 6. Isa. 49. 13, 14, 15, 16. so that he still begets and nourisheth in them faith, re∣pentance, love, joy, hope, and all the graces of the Spi∣rit
unto immortalitie; And though many stormes and flouds arise, and beat against them, yet they shall never be able to take them off that foundation and rock, which by faith they are fastned upon; notwithstanding, through unbelief, and the temptations of Satan, the sensible sight of this light and love, be clouded and overwhelmed for a time; yet God is still the same, and they shall be sure to be kept by the power of God unto salvation, where they shall enjoy their purchased possession, they being ingraven upon the palmes of his hands, and their names having been written in the booke of life from all eter∣nitie. XXIV. Faith is ordinarily Rom. 10. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 28. begotten by the preaching of the Gospel, or word of Christ, without respect to Rom. 9. 16. any power or agency in the creature; but it being wholly Ezek. 16. 16. Rom. 3. 12. passive, and dead in trespasses and sins, doth believe and is converted by no lesse Rom. 1. 16. Ephes. 1. 19. Col. 2. 12. power then that which raised Christ from the dead. XXV. The preaching of the Gospel to the conversion of sinners, is Ioh. 3. 14, 15. & 1. 12. Isa. 55. 1. Ioh. 7. 37. absolutely free; no way requiring as abso∣lutely necessary, any qualifications, preparations, or ter∣rors of the Law, or preceding ministery of the Law; but onely and alone the naked soule, a 1 Tim. 1. 15. Rom. 4. 5. & 5. 8. Acts 5. 0, 31. & 2. 36. 1 Cor. 1. 22. 24. sinner and ungodly to receive Christ crucified, dead, and buried, and risen againe, who is made a Prince and a Saviour for such sinners as through the Gospel shall be brought to be∣leeve on him. XXVI. The same power that converts to faith in Christ, carrieth on the 1 Pet. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9. soule through all duties, temptations, conflicts, sufferings; and whatsoever a believer is, he is c Phil. 2. 12, 13. Ioh. 13. 5.  Gal. 2. 19, 29. by 1 Cor. 15. 10. grace, and is carried on in all obedience and temp∣tations by the same.
XXVII. All believers are by Christ, united to God, by which a 1 Thess. 1. 1. Iohn 17. 21. & 20. 17. Heb. 2. 11. 1 Iohn 4. 16. union, God is one with them, and they are one with him; and that all believers are the Gal. 2. 19, 20 Sons of God, and joynt heires with Christ, to whom belong all the promises of this life, and that which is to come. XXVIII. Those that have union with Christ, are justified from 1 Iohn 1. 7. Heb. 10. 14. & 9. 26. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 3, 23. Acts 13. 38, 39. Rom. 5. 1. & 3. 25, 30. all their sins by the bloud of Christ; which justifica∣tion is a gracious and full acquitance of a guilty sinner from all sinne, by God, through the satisfact on that Christ hath made by his death for all their sinnes. And this applied (in the manifestation of it) through faith. XXIX. All beleevers are a holy and 1 Cor. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 9. sanctified people, and that sanctification is a spiritual grace of the Eph. 1. 4. new cove∣nant, and an effect of the 1 John 4. 16 Mat. 28. 20. love of God manifested in the soul, whereby the beleever presseth after a heavenly and Evangelicall obedience to all the commands which Christ as Head and King in his new covenant hath pre∣scribed to them. XXX. All beleevers through the knowledge of 2 Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 5. 9. 10. that justi∣fication of life given by the Father, and brought forth by the bloud of Christ, have as their great priviledge of that new Isa. 54. 10. & 26. 12. covenant, peace with God, and reconciliati∣on, whereby they that were afarre off are made nigh by Eph. 2. 13. 14. that bloud, and have Eph. 4. 7. peace passing all understanding; yea, joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by Rom. 5. 10, 11. whom we have received the atonement. XXXI. All beleevers in the time of this life, are in a continu∣all Rom. 7. 23, 2. Eph. 6, 10, 11, 12. 13. warfare and combate against sin, selfe, the world, and the Devil; and are liable to all manner of afflicti∣ons,
Heb. 2. 9, 10. 2 Tim. 3. 12. tribulations, and persecutions, being Rom. 8. 29. 1 Thess. 3. 3. Gal. 2. 19. 20. 2 Cor. 5. 7. predesti∣nated and appointed thereunto, and whatsoever the Saints possesse or enjoy of God spiritually, is by faith, and outward and temporall things are lawfully enjoyed by a civill right by them who have Deut. 2. 5. no faith. XXXII. The onely strength by which the Saints are enabled to encounter with all oppositions and Iohn 16. 33. trials, is Iohn 15. 5. Phil. 4. 11. onely by Jesus Christ, who is the Captain of their salvation, being made perfect through Heb. 2. 9, 10. sufferings, who hath en∣gaged d  Tim. 4. 18. his faithfulnesse and strength to assist them in all their afflictions, and to uphold them in all their temp∣tations, and to preserve them by his power to his ever∣lasting Kingdome. XXXIII. Jesus Christ hath here on earth a spiritual kingdom, which is his Church, whom he hath purchased and re∣deemed a Matth. 11. 1, 2 Thess. 1. 15. & 1 Cor. 1. 2. Eph. 1. 1 to himselfe as a peculiar inheritance; which Church is a company of visible Saints, Rom. 1. 7. Acts 19. 8, 9. & 26. 18. 2 Cor 6. 17. Rev. 18. 4. called and se∣parated from the world by the Word and Acts 2. 37. with 10 37. Spirit of God, to the visible profession of the faith of the Gos∣pel, Rom. 10. 10. Mat. 18. 19, 20. Acts 2, 42. being baptized into that faith, and joyned to the Lord, and each to other, by mutuall agreement in the Acts 9. 26. 1 Pet. 2 5. practical enjoyment of the ordinances commanded by Christ their Head and King. XXXIV. To this Church he Ma 28. 18, 19, 20. hath made his promises, and gi∣ven the signes of his covenant, 1 Cor. 11. 24. & 3. 21. 2 Cor. 6. 18. Rom. 9. 4, 5. Psal. 13 3. 3. presence, acceptation, love, c blessing, and Rom. 3. 7. 10. protection. Here are the foun∣tains and springs of his heavenly graces Ezek. 47. 2. flowing forth to refresh and strengthen them, XXXV. And all his servants of all estates (are to acknowledge a Acts 2. 41. 47. Isa. 4. 3. 1 Cor. 12. 6, 7, 12, 18. Ezek. 20. 40. 37. him to be their Prophet, Priest, and King;) and called
thither to be enrolled among his houshold servants, to present their bodies and soules, and to bring their gifts God hath given them, to bee under his heavenly conduct and government, to lead their lives in this wal∣led Sheepfold, and watered Cant. 4. 12. Eph. 2. 19. Rom. 12. 4, 5, 6. Col. 1. 12. & 2. 5, 6, 19. Garden, to have commu∣nion here with his Saints, that they may be assured that they are made meet to bee partakers of their Acts 20. 32. inheri∣tance in the Kingdome of God; and to supply each o∣thers wants, inward and outward; (and although each person hath a Acts 5. 4. propriety in his own estate, yet they are to supply each others wants, according as their Acts 2. 44, 45. & 4. 34. 35. neces∣sities shall require, that the name of Jesus Luke 14. 26. 1 Tim. 6. 1. Christ may not be blasphemed through the necessity of any in the Church) and also being come, they are here by himselfe to be bestowed in their severall order, due place, peculi∣ar use, being fitly compact and knit together Eph. 4. 16. accor∣ding to the effectuall working of every part, to the edi∣fying of it selfe in love. XXXVI. Being thus Joyned, every Church Act. 1. 23. 26.  6. 3. with 15. 22, 25. hath power given them from Christ, for their wel-being to chuse among themselves meet persons for Rom. 12. 7. 8. Elders and Deacons, be∣ing qualified according to the Word, 1 Tim. 3. 2, 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12. 8. 28. Heb. 13. 7, 17, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 3. as those which Christ hath appointed in his Testament, for the feeding, governing, serving, and building up of his Church, and that none have any power to 1 Pet. 4. 15. impose on them either these or any other. XXXVII. That the Ministers lawfully called, as aforesaid, ought Heb. 5 4. Ioh. 10. 3, 4, Acts 20. 28, 29. Rom. 12. 7, 8. Heb. 13. 7, 17. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. to continue in their calling and place, according to Gods ordinance, and carefully to feed the flock of God committed to them, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.
XXXVIII. The Ministers of Christ ought to have whatsoever a 1 Cor. 9. 7, 14. Gal. 6 8. Phil. 4. 15, 16. they shall need, supplied freely by the Church, that ac∣cording to Christs ordinance they that preach the Go∣spel b 2 Cor. 10. 4. 1 Tim. 1. 9. Psal. 110. 3. should live of the Gospel by the law of Christ. XXXIX. Baptisme is an ordinance of the Matth. 28. 18, 19 John 4. 1. Mark 16. 15, 16. Acts 2. 37, 38, & 8. 36, 37, 38, & 18. . new Testament, gi∣ven by Christ, to be dispensed upon persons professing faith, or that are made Disciples; who upon profession of faith, ought to be baptized, and after to partake of the Lords supper. XL. That the way and manner of the Matth. 3. 6. 16. Mark 1 5. vers. 9. reads [into Iordan] in Greek. Ioh. 3. 23. Acts 8. 38 dispensing this or∣dinance, is dipping or plunging the body under water; it being a signe, must answer the things signified, which is, that interest the Saints have in the Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6 1 Cor. 15. 28, 29. death, burial, and re∣surrection of Christ: And that as certainly as the body b Rev. 1. 5. & 7. 14. with Heb. 10. 22. is buried under water, and risen again, so certainly shall the bodies of the Saints bee raised by the power of Christ, in the day of the resurrection, to reigne with Christ. The word Baptizo signi∣fies to dip or plunge, (yet so as convenient garments be both upon the Administrator and subject with all modesty.) XLI. The person designed by Christ to dispence Baptisme, Isa 8. 16. Ephes. 3 7. Mar 18. 19. Joh. 4. 2. Acts 20. 7. Chap. 11. 10. 1 Cor. 11. 24. with 1 Cor. 10 16, 17. the Scripture holds forth to bee a Disciple; it be∣ing no where tied to a particular Church-officer, or per∣son extraordinarily sent, the Commission injoyning the administration, being given to them as considered Di∣sciples, being men able to preach the Gospel. XLII. Christ hath likewise given power to his Church to Rom. 16. 2. Mat. 18. 17. receive in, and cast out, any member that deserves it;
and this power is given to every Congregation, and not 1 Cor. 5. 4. ▪ 13. with 12. 6 2,  to one particular person, either member or officer, but in relation to the whole body, in reference to their faith 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7 and fellowship. LXIII. And every particular member of each Church, how Mat. 18. 16, 17, 18 Acts 11. 2, 3 1 Tim. 5. 19, 20 21 excellent, great, or learned soever, is subject to this cen∣sure and judgement; & that the Church ought not with∣out great care and tendernesse, and due advice, but by the Col. 4. 17. Acts 15. 1, 2, 3 rule of faith to proceed against her members. XLIV. Christ for the keeping of this Church in holy and Act. 20, 27, 2 Heb. 13. 17. 2 Mat. 24. 45. 1 Thes. 5. 2. 1▪ Jude 3. 20. Heb. 10. 34, 35 & 12. 15. orderly communion, placeth some speciall men over the Church, who by their office, are to governe, over∣see, visite, watch; So likewise for the better keeping thereof, in all places by the members, he hath given authoritie, and laid dutie upon all to watch over one another. XLV. Also such to whom God hath given gifts in the 1 Cor. 14. 3 &c. Church, may and ought to Prophecie, according to the Rom. 12. 6. 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11 1 Cor. 12. 7.  1 Thes. 10 19, 20, 21 proportion of faith, & so to teach publickly the Word of God, for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the Church. XLVI. Thus being rightly gathered, and continuing in the Rev. 2. & 3. Chap. Acts 15. 12. 1 Cor. 1. 10 Heb. 10 25 Iude 19. Rev. 2. 20, 21. 22. Acts 15. 1, 2. Rom. 14, 1. & 15. 1, 2, 3 obedience of the Gospel of Christ, none are to sepa∣rate for faults and corruptions (for as long as the Church consists of men subject to failings, there will be difference in the true constituted Church) untill they have in due order, and tendernesse, sought redresse thereof. XLVII. And although the particular Congregations be di∣stinct
and severall 1 Cor. 4. 17. & 14. 33. 36. & 16. 1. bodies, every one as a compact and knit Psal. 132. 3. Ephes. 2. 12. 19 with Rev. 21. Citie within it selfe; yet are they all to walke by 1 Tim. 3. 15. & 6. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 4. 17. one rule of truth; So also they (by all meanes conve∣nient) are to have the counsell and helpe Act. 15. 2, 3. Cant. 8. 8, 9. 2 Cor. 8. 1. 4. 13, 14. one of ano∣ther, if necessitie require it, as members of one body, in the common faith, under Christ their head. XLVIII. A civill Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14 1 Tim 2. 1, 2, 3. The supreame Magistracy of this Kingdom wee acknow∣ledge to be the King and Par∣liament (now established) freely chosen by the Kingdome, and that we are to maintaine and de∣fend all civill Lawes and civill Officers made by them, which are for the good of the Common∣wealth: and wee acknowledge with thankfulnesse that God hath made this present King and Par∣liament honorable in throwing down the Prelaticall Hierarchy, because of their tyranny and op∣pression over us, under which this Kingdom long groaned, for which we are ever ingaged to blesse God, and honour them for the same: and concerning the worship of God; there is but one Law-giver, which is able to save and destroy, James 4. 12. which is Jesus Christ, who hath gi∣ven Lawes and Rules sufficient in his Word for his worship; and for any to make more, were to charge Christ with want of wisdome, or faithfulnesse, or both, in not making Lawes enough, or not good enough for his house: surely it is our wisdome, dutie, and priviledge, to ob∣serve Christs Lawes onely, Psal. 2. 6. 9, 10, 12. so it is the Magistrates dutie to tender the libertie of mens consciences, Eccl. 8. 8. (which is the tenderest thing unto all conscientious men & most dear unto them, and without which all other liberties will not be worth the naming, much lesse injoy∣ing) and to protect all under them from all wrong, injury, oppression and molestation; so its our dutie not to be wanting in nothing which is for their honour and comfort and whatsoever is for the well-being of the Common-wealth wherein we live; it is our dutie to do, and we beleeve it to be our expresse dutie, especially in matters of Religion, to be fully perswaded in our minds of the Lawfulnesse of what we doe, as knowing whatsoever is not of faith is sin: and as wee cannot doe any thing contrary to our understandings and consciences, so neither can we forbeare the doing of that which our understandings and consciences bind us to doe: and if the Magistrate should require us to doe otherwise, we are to yeeld our persons in a passive way to their power, as the Saints of old have done, Jam. 5. 4. And thrice happy shall he be, that shall lose his life for wit∣nessing (though but for the least tittle) of the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 5. Gal 5. Magistracy is an Ordinance of God, set up by him for the punishment of evill doers, and for the praise of them that doe well; and that in all lawfull things, commanded by them, subjection ought to be gi∣ven by us in the Lord, not onely for wrath, but for conscience sake; and that we are to make supplications and prayers for Kings, and all that are in authoritie, that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlinesse and honesty.
XLIX. But in case we finde not the Magistrate to favour us herein; Act. 2. 40, 41 & 4. 19. & 5. 28, 29. 41 & 20. 23. 1 Thes. 3. 3. Phil. 1. 28, 29. Dan 3. 16, 17. & 6. 7. 10. 22, 23. yet wee dare not suspend our practice, because we believe we ought to goe on in obedience to Christ, in professing the faith which was once deliver'd to the Saints, which faith is declared in the holy Scriptures, and this our confession of faith a part of them, and that wee are to witnesse to the truth of the old and new Te∣stament unto the death, if necessitie require, in the midst of all tryals and afflictions, as his Saints of old have done; not accounting our goods, lands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, brethren, sisters; yea, and our owne lives deare unto us, so wee may finish our course with joy, remembring alwayes, that we ought to 1 Tim. 6. 13, 14, 15. Rom. 12. 1. 8. 1 Cor. 14. 37. obey God rather then men, who will when we have finished our course, and kept the faith, give us Rev. 2. 20. the Crowne of righ∣teousnesse; to 2 Tim. 4. 6, 7, 8. Rom. 14. 10. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Psal. 49. 7. Psal. 50. 22. whom wee must give an account of all our actions, and no man being able to discharge us of the same. L. It is lawfull for a Christian to be a Magistrate or Ci∣vill Acts 8. 38. & 10. 1, 2. 35. 44. Rom. 16. 23. Deut. 6. 13. Rom. 1. 9. 2 Cor. 10. 11. Jer. 4. 2. Heb. 6. 16. Officer; and also it is lawfull to take an Oath, so it be in truth, and in judgement, and in righteousnesse, for confirmation of truth, and ending of all strife; and that by rash and vaine Oaths the Lord is provoked, and this Land mournes. LI. Wee are to give unto all men, whatsoever is their 1 Thes. 4. 6. Rom. 13. 5, 6, 7 Mat. 22. 21. Tit. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 15. 17. & 5. 5. Eph. 5. 21. 23. & 6. 1. 9. Tit. 3. 1, 2, 3. due, as their place, age, estate requires; and that we de∣fraud no man of any thing, but to doe unto all men, as we would they should doe unto us. LII. There shall be a Acts 24. 15. resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust, and every one shall give an account of
himselfe to God, that every one may receive the things 2 Cor. 5. 10. done in his body, according to that he hath done, whe∣ther Rom. 14. 12. it be good or bad. The Conclusion. THus we desire to give unto Christ that which is his, and unto all law∣full Authority that which is their due, and to owe nothing to any man but love, to live quietly and peaceably, as it becommeth Saints, endea∣vouring in all things to keep a good conscience, and to doe unto every man (of what judgement soever) as we would they should doe unto us, that as our practice is, so it may prove us to be a conscionable, quiet, and barmlesse peo∣ple, (no wayes dangerous or troublesome to humane Society) and to labour and work with our hands that we may not be chargeable to any, but to give to him that needeth both friends and enemies, accounting it more excellent to give then to receive. Also we confesse that we know but in part, and that we are ignorant of many things which we desire and seek to know: and if a∣ny shall doe us that friendly part to shew us from the word of God that wee see not, we shall have cause to be thankfull to God and them. But if any man shall impose upon us any thing that we see not to be commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ, we should in his strength rather embrace all reproaches and tortures of men, to be stript of all outward comforts, and if it were pos∣sible, to die a thousand deaths, rather then to doe any thing against the least tittle of the truth of God, or against the light of our own consciences. And if any shal call what we have said Heresie, then do we with the Apostle acknow∣ledge, that after the way they call heresie, worship we the God of our Fathers, disclaiming all Heresies (rightly so called) because they are against Christ, & to be stedfast and immoveable, alwayes abounding in obedience to Christ, as knowing our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. PSAL. 74. 21, 22. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause; Remember how the foolish man blasphemeth thee daily. O let not the oppressed returne ashamed, but let the poore and needy praise thy Name. Come Lord Jesus, come quickly. FINIS.
