By the King. A Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of Allome into any his Maiesties Dominions. IAmes by the Grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting. Whereas Wee haue alwayes held it one of the most and necessary cares and considerations incident to the State and Office of Kings and Soueraigne Princes, so to dispose of their people and gouernment, as the knowledge and vse of good and profitable Arts and Inuentions may become common and frequent among their people, the same being one of the greatest meanes to encrease and preserue the wealth and strength of State and people, considering how contrary effects Labour and Idlenesse doe produce; the one making King∣domes great and flourishing, the other, alwayes bearing the markes of beggerie and contempt: Forasmuch as some of Our good and louing Subiects of Our Realme of England, haue of late to their great charge, and no lesse commendation, found out, and made proofe of sundry Mines in Our Countie of Yorke, and elsewhere within Our Realme of England, for the making of Allome, a Merchandize of great necessitie, and vse sundry wayes for all Our Dominions, and did so well and commendably proceed therein, as that they were able to make sufficient store of Allome, not onely to serue for the vse and expence of all Our said Kingdomes, but also to afford and spare great quantities thereof, to be euery yeere Transported for the vse and seruice of Our neighbour King∣domes and Nations: And whereas the said persons by their skill and industrie, haue effected so good and great a worke, haue willingly and freely offered and yeelded vp the same Allome Mines into Our hands, vpon such conditions and considerations, as haue giuen them full contentment and satisfaction, all men being able to iudge, that a matter of that consequence, and wherein so many of Our people should be interessed, was more fit for Us to take into Our handes, then to leaue the same in the power of priuate men: For which causes and considerations, Wee haue caused the said whole Worke to bee taken into Our possession, and of late haue disbursed great summes of
Money thereupon for the setting forward and aduanting the said Worke, for the good and be of Our people and louing Subiects, and haue also prouided and taken sufficient order, that Our louing Subiects in all parts, shall not at any time want conuenient quantitie of the said Commo∣ditie of Allome for their vse, and shall also be serued of it at reasonable prices: which care and good intention of Ours, hath of late bene greatly interrupted and opposed, by the bringing into Our said Kingdomes and Dominions, great quantities of forraigne Allome from diuers parts beyond the Seas, whereby this so excellent an Inuention and blessing of Almighty GOD, bestowed vpon Us and Our people, is likely to be vtterly defeated and ouerthrowne, if the same by Our care should not be prouided for, and carefully preuented. And albeit that by meanes of the Allome made and to be made within Our said Realmes, Wee shall receiue great hinderance in Our Customes, and other dueties, formerly payed vnto Us and Our predecessours, Kings and Queenes of this Realme, for and vpon that commoditie imported; yet Wee, that in all Our actions and proceedings haue Our eye of Grace rather vpon the flourishing estate of Our Kingdomes, and the comfort of Our people, then vpon Our profite, haue resolued rather to quit and forsake such benefit vnto Our owne Coffers, then to interrupt or ouerthrow so excellent a Worke, of Our care and Princely pol∣licie, for the welfare of Our Subiects. These are therefore to require and command all and singuler person and persons whatsoeuer, aswell Our naturall borne Subiects, as Denizons or Strangers, That none of them, nor any other person or persons whatsoeuer, doe at any time or times hereafter, attempt or presume to bring, or cause to be brought into these Our Realmes of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or any other Our Dominions, or into any the Ports, Hauens, Creekes, or places of any of them, any Al∣lome, in greater or lesser quantities, made or to be made in any forraigne part or place whatsoeuer, or of Allome made here within this Kingdome, after that the same hath bene exported, vpon paine of forfeiture of all and euery quantitie and quantities of Allome, so brought, or caused to be brought into Our said Dominions, contrary to this Our present commandement: All which said Allome brought and to be Imported and forfeited, Our will and pleasure is, that such person and persons as shall make seizure of the same Allome, shall foorthwith conuey the same Allome to the Warehouse of Robert Iohnson Merchant, one of Our Agents for that businesse, lying in Our Citie of London, where hee so bringing and deliuering the same, shall haue and receiue of Our said Agent, vpon the deliuery thereof, the full summe of Twelue pounds for euery Tunne of Allome, and so ratably Twelue shil∣lings for euery Hundreth weight of such, and so much as hee and they shall bring thither; to the end that the same Allome, shall be with all conuenient speed Exported out of this Kingdome into some forreigne parts beyond the Seas, so as no forraigne Allome be sold, spent or vsed, within these Our said Realmes or Dominions, or any part thereof; And also vpon paine of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further paines, penalties and punishments, as for the contempt of Our commandement Royall in this behalfe, may any way be inflicted vpon them, or any of them so of∣fending, contrary to the true intent and meaning herein signified. And We doe further straightly charge and command all and singuler persons, that shall seize any such forreigne Allome as aforesaid, shall foorthwith conuey and bring the same, and the whole quantitie thereof (without selling, vttering, compounding or deliuering backe any part,) vnto the house of the said Robert Iohnson, as is before declared, vpon paine of Imprisonment, and such other punishment as shalbe fit to be inflicted for the breach of this Our Royall Commandement. And Wee doe also further require and command, all and singuler the Officers of Our Customes within
all and euery the Ports and Hauens of the same Our Dominions, and the Creekes and mem∣bers of the same Ports, that they and euery of them, doe from and after the date hereof, at all times forbeare to take any entry or entries, or to take and make any Composition for any Custome, Sub∣sidie, or other duetie, for or vpon any Allome, brought or to bee brought into any Our Dominions, from any forreigne parts: And also that they and euery of them (whom it doeth and shall con∣cerne) doe stay and seize as forfeited and confiscated, to the vse and vses aforesaid, all and singuler such Allome, as from and after the date hereof, shalbe by any person or persons whatsoeuer, brought into any Port, Hauen or Creeke of the same Our Dominions, vpon paine of forfeiture of their Offi∣ces, and of vndergoing Our high indignation and displeasure, with such further paines and pu∣nishments, as for the same their contempts or defaults, may any way be inflicted vpon them, and euery of them in this behalfe offending. And for the better execution of this Our present will and Commandement, Wee doe straightly charge and command all Iustices of the Peace, Maiors, Bayliffes, Sheriffes, Constables, Head∣boroughes, Tything-men, and all other Our Officers, Ministers and louing Subiects, to whom it shall and may appertaine, That they and euery of them, at all time and times hereafter, and from time to time, be ayding and assisting to Our said Customers, Collectors, Searchers, Waiters, and to all such other person and persons, as Wee shall lawfully authorize for the searching, seizing, taking, and carying away of all and euery such Allomes, Imported, or hereafter to be Imported, contrary to this Our Royall Prohibition and Commandement. And neuerthelesse Wee doe hereby signifie and declare, That whereas Wee did publish a former Proclamation of this nature, bearing date the Nineteenth day of Iune, in the seuenth yeere of Our Raigne, that Our intention is, that the same (as to all offences past,) doe stand in full force, any thing in this present Procla∣mation to the contrary notwithstanding. Giuen at Royston the tenth day of October, in the twelfth yeere of our Raigne of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the eight and fourtieth. God saue the King. Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. Anno Dom. 1614.
