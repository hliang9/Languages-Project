To Our Lovits,  Messengers, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting: Forasmuch as the late Rebellion, and rising in Arms in the Western Shires, is too great an evidence that there are man Disaffected Persons in these Places, who are ready to involve the Kingdom again in a bloody and unnatural war: And that we have just reason to suspect that these Rebels will be ready to lay hold in this opportuni∣ty, to rise in Arms, when we are necessitate to continue the war with Our Forraign Enemies. And not only to make use of such Arms, Powder and Ammunition, as they have concealed, or may be transported to them from Our Enemies; but will seize upon the Arms of Our well affected Sub∣jects, who reside amongst them, and are not able to make resistance: Which may endanger the Peace of the Kingdom, and weaken Our Forces, necessitating them at one time to oppose Forraign Invasions, and Intestine Commotions. As likewise, that according to their former wicked practices, they may invade the Ministers of the Gospel, who are lawfully admitted Preachers amongst them, and do violence or injury to their Persons, to the great contemnt of Our Authority, and scandal of the Reformed Religion, as it is now protest.
