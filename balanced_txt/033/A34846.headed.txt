AN ACCOUNT Of some Proceedings, lately made, for an Effectual Prohibition of the EXPORTA∣TION of WOOLL, &c. Recommended to the WOOLLEN MANU∣FACTURERS f this KINGDOME. FRANCIS MONK, and others, ha∣ving made several Attempts to obtein a Commission, to Empower them to put in Execution the Laws for Prohibiting the Exportation of WOOL &c. Petitioned the Late King of Blessed Memory to that end, the Consideration whereof was referred to the Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of Trade, who made their Re∣port thereupon, which, together with the said Petition by Order of Council, was referred to the Right Honourable the Lords of the
Treasury; and their Lordships, for their better Information, referred the Matter, with the said Monk's Proposal and Papers, to the Attorney General, to the Commissioners of the Customs, and the Hamburgh Company; who ha∣ving severally made their Respective Re∣ports, the said Proposers not being recommended thereby, as Persons fitting for so great an undertaking, their Project took no effect. And in regard, some of the said Proposers, in former Sessions of Parliament, had endeavou∣red to set on foot new Bills, to alter and abate the Penalties of the Laws, already made, to Prohibit the said Exportation; it was doubt∣ed, whether they were Persons qualified for a hearty carrying on the pretended Prohibition. Therefore, in July 1684, Benjamin Craker, Charles Craker, and Joseph Reeve, Staplers, William Brewer, John Wood, John Walkley, Richard Scott, Thomas Smale, Thomas Crundal and seve∣ral others, Clothiers and Factors, hearing of the Attempt of the said Monk and his Partners, Petitioned the Lords of the Treasury, setting
forth, that the said Proposal (if honestly in∣tended) being of great Moment, and univer∣sal Concern to the Kingdome, was not fitting to be trusted in the hands of such (or any) pri∣vate Persons; and therefore pray'd their Lord∣ships to recommend the same to the Hambo∣rough, East-India, Turkey, African, Russia, and East∣land Companies, and other general Woollen Traders, of whose Prudence and Integrity there could be no suspition, to consider the said Pro∣posals, and to report to their Lordships such Rules and Methods, as they thought sit, for the Effectual putting the said Lawes in Execu∣tion. In answer to which Petition, the Right Ho∣nourable the Lords of the Treasury, by their Letters to the said several Companies, of the 25 of July 1684; taking notice that the effectual Prohibition of the Exportation of WOOLL would be of great advantage, not only to his Majesty, but all his Trading Subjects, Transmit∣ting also a Copy of the said Propo∣sal and Papers, desired the said Compa∣nies, or some Members by them Deputed, to meet together, to consider the said Papers, and
report such rules and methods, for putting the said Prohibition in execution, as they should conceive most effectual for that end; and to in∣form their Lordships, whether they were wil∣ling to take the care of seeing the Lawes put in Execution, for Prohibiting the said Exportation. Hereupon, several Members were Deputed by each of the said Companies of Merchants to meet; who at a Conference together agreed, that the said Prohibition could not be effected, without raising a Fund to defray the expence thereof, and that it was not fit to put the KING to the charge of it; but rather that all the Woollen Artifi∣cers and Traders should contribute thereunto, that so those Persons, who feel the said Greivance, should be instrumental and assisting in the Re∣dressing thereof. The Factors of Blackwel-Hall did also chuse one or two Persons out of each Hall, to attend the Committee of the said Companies of Mer∣chants; who having declared their readiness to Contribute to so good a Work, several of them entered into a Subscription to pay voluntarily several Rates upon all sorts of Woollen Manufa∣ctures
consigned to them (viz.) for every Cloth 2d. for every Searge 1d. and so proportionably for all other sorts of the English Woollen Manu∣facture, which Subscription was cheerfully Signed by several of the most eminent Factors. Now because, at several Sessions of Parlia∣ment, there have not been wanting some Per∣sons, who have attempted to overthrow the wholesome Lawes, already made for prohibiting the said Exportation. And therefore it is like∣ly, the same Designs will again be set on foot, either by the same or such like Persons. And the Session of Parliament being near ap∣proaching, for the prevention thereof it is pro∣posed, that all maner of Woollen Manufacturers in the several Counties of England, would join in the said Subscription for the carrying on so good a Work, by so light and easie Contribu∣tion as aforesaid, only for an Experiment of three Years, that so the Progress already made therein may not be obstructed; the Merchants being likewise willing to Contribute thereunto conside∣rably. And for the satisfaction of all Persons assisting in so great a Work, that there may be no just Objection against it: It is Propo∣sed,
that the Clothiers and Factors shall have Li∣berty to appoint Members out of themselves to join with the Merchants, deputed to consi∣der of the Method, and dispose of the Moneys collected, that it may be impossible the Con∣tribution should be abused or imployed to other Purposes; it being not likely to imagine, that, where there is such a joint united Assistance of all manner of Persons concerned in the Wollen-Trade, so many incorporated Companies of Merchants and others concerned, the Clothiers and Factors by their Deputies being present and privy at all Consultations, there should be any Miscarriage. And the said Prohibition can never be Ma∣naged with that Candor and Vprightness, by pri∣vate and particular Persons. Who, as they declare undertake it, to get Money by it; Whereas these Companies do propose to spend both their Time and Mony without any manner of Design of private Benefit to themselves, but with a constant Annual Charge, freely Contributed for the Pub∣lick Good. Now for as much, as, in former Sessions of Parliament, the whole matter of the said mis∣chiefs
of Exportation hath been throughly consi∣dered, and Concluded, that the Acts in force against the said Exportation, wanted only Ex∣planation and Execution; to the end that a short Bill to that purpose may pass, this next Session, its desired that the Woollen Manufacturers, in the several Counties, will engage their respe∣ctive Members to promote the same. FINIS.
