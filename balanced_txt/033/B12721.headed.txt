In consideration whereof, and for that the time being runne out, & the saide Annexation once established, the said Farmers, Leassees, Oc∣cupiers, Possessours, and others clayming vnder them, cannot obtaine to themselues so certaine and assured meanes of their benefit, quiet and freedome from Questions, Suits, and troubles, for the comfort of themselues, their wiues and children, as they now may: His most excellent Maiestie hath of his aboundant grace (with aduise of his Priuie Councell) caused this his Roy∣all and Princely care and fauour to all his louing Subiects, to bee by these presents openly and vniuersally diuulged and published, to the end that all of them (whom it concerneth) may in time apprehend, and take the benefit thereof, and none of them may be preuented of so great a benefit, for want of timely knowledge or vnderstanding. Giuen at our Pallace of Westminster the xvij. day of February, in the second yeere of our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King.
