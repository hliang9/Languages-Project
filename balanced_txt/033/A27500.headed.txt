Newes from Ireland the twelfth of March. LOving Brother I have sent you what I now recei∣ved from Tredath from a worthy Minister, Deane Barnard, and need to doubt of the truth of it, and indeed you need truth to be sent to you, for such a multitude of lying Pamphlets you have daily Printed of our proceedings in Ireland as it is a shame to see, and much spoken against such vile untruths; which is to be wondred at that are untrue, in neither place nor time, nor men. Our Dublin Army is still abroad, but we heare well of them. An Abstract of such Newes as hath falen out from Feb. 26 to March the 5, being the day the siege ended. NO sooner were the vessels that came from Dublin to relieve us unlanded, but a faire North-west wind served them for their returne, where Feb. 26 as they passed over our Barre in the sight, but beyond the reach of our envious enemie, our Governour the same after-noone issued out with 220 foot and a 120 horse, and having pilaged a certaine village of the Rebels cal∣led Beauly, about a mile of us, and burnt up their lod∣gings, he proceeded farther to Smithstowne, where being informed by his Scouts, of 5 Companies there ready to receive him, he had the more mind to them and his men by their former good successe, needing little in∣vitation, hee drew up to them, who no sooner felt the smart of our shot, but they instantly broke, and by the prosecution of our horse every man cast away their Armes to save their lives, nay, their very cloaths for
their greater speed of flight, so there were slaine about 300 of them, 2 Colours taken, & about a 100 Cowes brought in, so many were slaine in the river of Iellings∣towne that the water was dyed with their blood, wherin a part of Divine justice was observed, that this slaugh∣ter should be in the same place they had formerly so fraudulently defeated some of ours, in which it is con∣ceived and even repaired, and wherein some of the same Captaines of ours that were formerly rooted had their hands in this revenge in Epshall, Sir Patrick Weismes. Here Colonell Preston was hard put to it, who for hast lost his rich military Belt and a Portmantle of his best cloaths left behind, which fell out to be the booty of Horsbey, in the pocket of whose breaches were found 3 Letters of more worth then his head, wherby 2 Lords with others not farre from us, were by these found as deep in his rebellion as himselfe. The next morning it was thought good to prose∣cute this unexpected victory as probability of raising the siege on that side, before these could gather any head againe, and so very early by the breake of day 600 foot and a Troope of horse, after we had by prayers com∣mend them to Gods protection, which in the greatest expedition was sildome omited, marched out under my Lord Moores command, but the first Castle viz. Stranine, which beyond their former resolution, they thought to visit, but in the way within halfe a mile of us, was so entrenched and fortified, that it proved more difficult then was expected, yet our men drew up and bestowed about 1000 shots on them, to the death of many of them, but by the fall of a mighty raine whereby their matches were neare wasted out, they were compel'd to returne; yet some were sent to the next village called Colpe, pilaged the Corne remaining,
& burnt their Cabbins, and so came well in by Church time, to give God thanks for his great preservation, that in all that eminent dangers, we had not a man lost, and indeed, all this our siege not above 12 men have we lost by the enemy, the rest that dyed were by famin and other diseases, besides some unarmed men or wo∣men and children, that going out to pilage were killed by the enemy basely; but this forenmed Castle, was for prevention of our taking of it, maned by the ene∣my, with 400 men more then what was yet, hearing of our resolution and preparation against it, they abandoned it of themselves, and left it to our posses∣sion. After one days rest, March the first, my Lord Moore and the Governour went out againe the same way, a convenient number of horse and foot; when after securing of at least 200 worth of Corne, and the bur∣ning of what had remained of the former dayes worke at Colpe, these advanced further, their first resistants was 2 Companies of the Rebels, who abode something without shot, but came in and shot, and then betooke themselves to flight, and one Captaine and 60 others were slaine, and another Captaine Neal O Neale taken prisoner, and the Castle of Colpei after much hazard of such as first entred it by the pikes and stones by them within, whereby our men were 3 or 4 times bea∣ten backe downe the narrow staires, yet at last were all slaine, and all that day without the losse of one of ours, there was a Captain taken prisoner, with whom were found many Letters, and a Petition subscribed to Sir Phil. O Neal, with the Title of Earle of Tirons, and Generall of Ireland, but yet the foundation upon which all these ayrie honours were built, was the con∣dition of taking this our City, but that day his Ex∣cellency
was much humbled, who unknowne to us was stolne over the river, and by our unexpected approach being in feare of taking, crept into a ur-bush, and so lay like a trembling Hare in his forme till the evening not farre from us. March the 3. some other sorces marched out in the morning, as far as Marlingstowne, about three miles from us, whereby the former fights, they found the Towne abandoned, so that their whole worke that day was to reape what was left, for which all Soldiers were that day permitted to goe out for Pilage; by which meanes the Spring seemed to be Harvest, and the ver∣nall Aequinoctiall to have beene mistaken for the na∣turall Autumnall, such a world of Corne like mow∣ing Haggards came into our City, the greatest scarci∣ty we had was of Mault, for which we had for seaven dayes before drunke water, but now such was Gods goodnesse, that on a sudden, from the extremity of want was turned to as plenty; such a plenty, not to be thought, which caused our Enemies to begin to be so sicke, that they for envie left their houses in the midst of this our joy, but we had like to have had a rule by a Gabard of Powder, that run a ground on the river, but by our mens watching till ten a clocke at night, that was prevented in the evening tyde. But March the 5. was a Memorable day with us in∣deed, when 400. Foot and 80. Horse marched out un∣der the command of the Lord Moore, on the the north side among his owne tenants to Talloglland, where Co∣lonell Mac Byan, with his companies have beene billet∣ted and were unknowne to us, the night before upon some mischiefvous counsell, the whole fraturnity of the Rebels had cropt Sir Phi. O Neale being President, there appeared 80. Coullers, and in view 3. for one
of ours they had entrenched and fortyfied in a place of the Towne, but our men declined them not, but with as much alacrity as there commands could wish, drew up boldly and gave fire so thicke and sure, that after the Rebels had replyed to three or foure files of shot, and finding so many droopping among them, they be∣tooke themselves to their fast refuge their heeles, a∣bout 300. of the common souldiers, and not lesse then 30. Officers slaine in the place, and a great man made by themselves, Baron of Monghun, Art Rore Mac Maughan by name, whose head is voted in the Procla∣mation Printed in Dublin and is taken prisoner; who being wounded to shew his invitable end, politickly stripped himselfe starkenaked, and lay as dead among the slaine; but by the viewing of the body by Captain Berone, and tumbling the body about was discovered, and promised upon his faith given, that he would cause the redemption of my Lady Blainy and her chil∣dren, and we thinke is accordingly done. Which hap∣py exchange, we daily seeke for a 115. Muskquets were taken by us, and all the ground was covered with their Pikes, chaste away in their flight, in the meane time our Governour Sir Henry, issued out towards Beauly, to provoake Sir Phi. O Neale, whom we sup∣posed had kept that lodging still, burnt New-Towne under his nose, drew two companies to fight in the Castle, and returning, intending the assistance to the Lord Moore if there were need, but by firing all the Townes thereabouts, they soone perceived a victorie on the Lord Moores side, in this the Lord Moore be∣haved himselfe most valiently, beyond all expression, and to so great a hazard of his person, more then plea∣sed his Friends: had his Boot cut through his stock∣ing with a Sword, and another hurt his Horse with a
Pike, in the midst of all the danger of shot on every side, it came off without other harme; and which hath beene Gods wonderful preservation, nay all this hosts flight and prosecution for two miles about, not one man of ours so much as hurt, Sir Phi. O Neale, with the rest of there great commanders, having thus payed their way, fled very meanly attended, leaving such o∣ther Gentlemen behind to their miserable condition, which they did deservedly approve, and all their army hopes spoyled which they by him perswaded to, in this houre lighted my Lord Moore, who was the first that gave us assistance at first, so he was the last that chased them away in their troopes, dispersing the first of which he gave to appeare that evening, when some of the English escaping from them, brought newes, that the two Castles Beauly and Strainus, being wholly for∣saken by them, into which our Governour presently sent some Companies who entred peaceably, and with some horse, roved the Country toward Termonsecking, but found not a man of them, onely a world of Corne, which the Enemy could not fire for feare, so that now our gates are now opening, and City silling with pro∣vision and other boote, all the Country a far off desi∣ring to be admitted to our Market, all hearts rejoy∣cing, every street ringing with praises to God, the Donor to whom onely it doth belong, and that not onely patiently, but publickly and solemnely, we faile not thankefully to acknowledge. LOving Brother, my last to you was by a Friend Doctor Iones, in which I declared to you what befell us since my last Letter by the Post; which was, that out of Munster we had newes, that the Lord Presi∣dent joyning with some 150. English for us, arrived there lately, and that they had battell with the Enemy
being a great number, led by the Lord Mongarret, our men kild 1000. & put the rest to flight, the Lord Mongarret hard∣ly escaping. We had newes that Galway is out, but there is a fort by us commanded, which stands greatly to the disadvan∣tage of the Town; some hot blowes have beene betweene the Towne and Fort, but with much damage to the Towne, on the 7 of this moneth went out some of our Army, about 3000 foot and 600 horse, and went to many places where the enemy was reported to have beene, but the enemy still run away before them, what their intent is for it is not knowne, but our Army is still out, and yesterday they sent in one Lieut. Colonell Read that they tooke of the enemy, and Captaine Burfoot we had yesterday captives, some three come from Tredath who confirme the newes which we heard before, that they had given the enemy a great defeat, kill'd about 300 and 40 Officers of the enemy, the rest fled being a great number, curs but 700, they no lesse then 3000, upon this the enemy hath quite raysed the siege about the City, and they have an indiferent Market againe, the much comfort of the distressed Souldiers: the enemy is very dog-hearted, every day more then other, or appeare so to be, and many are reported to desire to come in, now they have done what mischiefe they can already: we have newes here, that many under write to give so much money with you to the warre, and to receive it in land, at a rate set down, which if it be true, as it is in Print, none can lay out money at bet∣ter rate, it wil be to great and shortly, and the land is as good as in England, and the seats as excellent, if you have a 100 or 200 of pounds, to under writ in this cause, and that you can be sure of land, as it is here declared, it would be much profit; the Irish are mad to see their lands so proffered. There is newes come in this morning to us from our Army, that the Lords of the Pale some of them offer themselves to come in now. FINIS.
