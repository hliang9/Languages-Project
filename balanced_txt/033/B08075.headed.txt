Trew faithfull Children he begat on me Sic lufe and faith to vther thay did beir, That thay knew not quhat beist was Ciuile weir, My heid wald not disdane my leggis and feit, My Eine foirsaw all perrallis micht me meit, My hands and armes ay reddy to defend me, To snib my Children gif thay did offend me, My body was weill cled with Policie, My Hat was of Iustice and Equitie, My Coller of trew Nichtbour lufe it was Weill prenit on with Kyndnes, and solas. My Bluiffis wer of fre Liberalitie My Sleiffis wer of, to borrow and len glaidlie, My Lais and Mailʒeis of trew parmanence,
My Stomak maid was of clene Conscience. My waist was gyrdit with Sobrietie, My Leggs and feit schod with Simplicitie. My hart was haill, my stomach weill disposit, Of peice and rest my Bowellis wer composit. Quhat wald ʒe moir Schir commoun weill and I Held hous lang tyme, bot Sathan had Inuy To se vs so, than callit he Seditioun With pryde his Sone to quhome he gaif cōmissioun To tak with thame discord and Nichthour feid (Efter I mene that our gude barnis wer deid) To poysoun me with thair Infectir cryme, With sum of my awin Children of this tyme, Of quhilks I pray the Lord God mak me fre, Ambitioun will not lat thame aggre, Thir mony ʒeiris thay haue me disconfortit, I trauell ʒit as I had thame aduortit, The malice greit that ilk to vther beiris, Dois ryfe my bowells with thair Ciuile weiris, Sair boistit thay my husband commoun weill, And maid thair vowis with aithis him for to Keill. In ony part quhair thay him with me fand Quhairfoir, for feir he fled from me Scotland. Away sum sayis to Veneis is he gone, Or to the Swisches as thay do suppone, Quhair he is saif from danger, hurt, or skaith, Heir wald he deit of cauld and hounger baith, Thus am I left as wedow in distres, For commoun weill, my bairnis left Fatherles. ❧ Children I had in all vertewis porfyte To peice, and Iustice was thair haill delyte. Sum of displesure deit for wo, and cair,
Sum wyrteit was, and blawin in the air And sum in Stirling fchot was to the deid, That mair was geuin to peice nor Ciuile feid. Bot ane was slane vnto my skaith and schame, Becaus he socht to fetche my husband hame, He was my deir and best belouit Sone, All that he did for my weilfair was done, Lyke ane gude Medciner or gude Syruge, Of euill humouris he did my body purge, Quhat wald ʒe moir sen Iames in Falkland deit, Nane for my weill, sa weill with me aggreit, Nor ʒit sa weill did lufe Schir Commoun weill, Nor vnto me bure sic ane feruent ʒeill. Murdreist he was in Lythgow tratrouslie, The murtherars vnto my beid did fle, Quhair thay tuik hald, and ʒit dois hald thame fast And ay sensyne my heid hes bene agast, For quhy throw falser and Subtillitie, Thay chaist away Iustice, and Equitie, For laik of quhilks my heid dois wark and ʒaik, And all my body trymbill, dois and schaik, For quhen the heid is seik the Prouerb is That all the members be the worse I wis. ¶ My claiths ar reuin that pietie is to se, Particular weill hes spuilʒeit Policie, My Coller rent is be Dame Fremitnes, The Prenis thairof ar reft be sad Nysenes, Dame Nigartnes my Gluifis hes hint away Iak for him self my Sleifis dois reist and stay. My Lace and Mailʒeis tane be variance, My Stomak worne is be dissimulance, My belt is cuttit of pure Gluttonie
My leggs and feit now schod with Pouertie My hart is seik, my stomach keipis na meit My bowells Rumbills, as thay wald vther eit. Now for to couer all this vilannie Ane Cloik thay gif me of authoritie, Authoritie (alaik) na les thay mene For thay desyre neuer to se thair Quene, Bot that thay may in hir Name bruik offices With power to cleik vp the benefices. Nane I excuse on ather syde, for quhy Ilk ane his awin hous seikis to edify, And nane dois cair for Commoun weill ane Prene, ¶ I grant I had ane Douchter was ane Quene Baith gude and fair, gentill and Liberall, Dotit with verte wis and wit Naturall, Prignant in Spreit in all things honourabill, Lusty gude lyke, to all men fauourabill.

Praisit be God I haue re at command That fair ʒoung Prince, in Stirling my richt hand▪ Wer not in hope I leif to se that day That he sall purge thir foull humburis away, And me restoir agane vnto my helth, Ʒea, caus my Children flurifche in all welth.

Thocht ʒe haue left all Superstitioun.
