To the Honourable CONVENTION. GENTLEMEN, YOU seem (for the most part of you) to be Worthy Men, and to me you appear Honest and Religious, and I am sure, there is not any Religion in the World, is Purer than Christs Religion, and the Doctrin of the Church of England, is that; and that has been the Cause that I have stood up for it; and if you be Sons of that Church, you must Practice that Doctrin, and that will be an Infallible Sign that you are Christs Disci∣ples when you yield Obedience to his Commands. Gentlemen, You know what a Sad Day it was when they Beheaded the Old King; and for what I know, there lies a Heavy Judgment upon this Nation for his Blood: Therefore this Day, ought to be a Great Day of Humi∣liation, to Implore God to Pardon our Sins; that we may not be guilty of his Blood: Therefore have a Care what you Do, least you draw Judgment upon your Selves and the Kingdom too. I perceive you have made the Crown vacant, and the King useless, without Examining any Faults, upon his bare going away: Methinks it is very unkind, though he has not Done as he should Do, yet you ought to Act better by him, than by Unthroning him, but to take away the Dispensing Power; for that has been the Cause of all our Misfortunes; and to have done your Endeavours to Free the Land from Popery, and if the King had not Complied to what You Proposed, it would then have been his Majesties Fault and not Yours: But I perceive you are like some Women that loves Changes, which should be beneath such Noble Souls as Men of Wis∣dom: So I Desire the Lord to Direct your Doings, that you may not Repent hereafter  who am Your Souls Well-Wisher, ELINOR JAMES.
