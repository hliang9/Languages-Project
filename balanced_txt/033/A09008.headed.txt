The preceptes teachyng a prynce or a noble estate his duetie / written by Agape∣tus in Greke to the empe∣rour Iustinian / and after translated into Latin / and nowe in to Englysshe by Thomas Paynell.
To the right excellēt and no∣ble baron / my lorde Montioy / lorde Chamberlayne to the quenes grace Thomas Pay∣nel gretyng. BVt that I hi∣therto haue mar¦ked excellent ba∣ron / bothe by phi¦losophers / lawe∣ers / orators / poe∣tis / and diuines / accustomably to haue ben vsed / that whan so euer any of them did either make worke / or translate any excel∣lent mans worke: are wont for ye de∣fence therof / exquisitely to chose som one well lerned or noble parsone / to whome they shulde vowe and dedi∣cate theyr laboure: I at this tyme
musyng to whome I shulde ascryue this my rude translation / shulde nat before many other haue chosen your excellence. Than if I vse an honest / olde / & approbate custome / who wyl blame me? If I chose an excellēt ler∣ned man (I meane your excellence) and borne of high blud / who wyl nat approue my doynge? If I dedicate my small peynes to you my especiall good lorde and patrone / who can re∣proue me? Nor the smalnes of this worke shall nat withdrawe me to as∣criue hit to your magnificēce: for of∣ten tymes in small and compēdious rules / are wount to be inclosed great wysedome and lernynge / as saythe Beroaldus in these verses: Sunt hec parua quidem fatcor: sed magna subinde Esse solent paruis deteriora bonis. Hoc adamas / gemine{que} docent: que corpore parno Oblectant reges / diuitibus{que} placent.
Nos contra horremus magnos persepe gygantes. Terremur magnis sepe voluminibus. And of a man of my degree and for∣tune / what other thynge myght be offered to your excellence so riche / so high in dygnite? Statius wryteth for Rutilius Gallus / Sepe deis hos inter honores. Cespes / et exiguo placuerunt farra salino. Farthermore if maister Agapetus abashed nat to wryte this his lyttell boke vnto ye emperour Iustinian / I wtout blame may dedicate ye same to your goodnes. I confesse hit a small thynge / but than I say hit is a boke of great wysedome and lernyng / cō∣teynynge all these preceptes / by the whiche nat onely a prince / but all o∣ther estates may lerne to do iustice / maye lerne howe by humanite and gentylnes to order theyr subiectes / ad seruauntes. Is this smalle boke
thā vnworthy to be moche made of? vnworthy to be dedicate to your ex∣cellence? vnworthy to be accepted? vnworthy often to be turned? Is it a lyght thynge for a prince / to lerne iustely howe to rule his people / and to tempre euery thynge by Iustice? Let them therfore that wyl dispreise this small worke bicause it is small / but my trust is / that your excellēce / nat consyderynge the smalnes ther∣of / but the brefe preceptis of greatte wysedome and lernynge therin con∣tryued: wyll nat only preyse hit / but also (by goddis grace) styll contynu∣ally ensewe the same. Thus I com∣mende  to your excellence / desy∣ryng your gētylnes gentylly (as ye be accustomed to do) to accept this my rude translacion.
The preceptes of Agapetus to the emperour Iustinian. COnsyderynge o myghty Empe∣rour thou hast the highest and hono∣rableste dignite of all dignites: thou shuldest honour & worshyp hȳ aboue all other / whiche hath reputed the worthy of suche ho¦nour. For why / god in likenes of his celestiall empere / hath delyuered to the / the sceptre and gouernaunce of this worlde / to instructe and teache thy subiectes to kepe iustice / and to punyshe them / whiche persuade the contrary / folowynge and obeyenge his lawes and his preceptis / and or∣derynge thy subiectes as right and
equite requirethe. ii. As the gouernour of a shyppe in tempest doth watche diligētly bothe for his owne sauegarde and his: so an emperour muste kepe suche dili∣gent watche / that equite and iustice be in surete: and so strongely repelle the vehement wawes of iniquite / that the ot of his worldly cōmon¦welth be nat frushed and brokē with the wawes of wickednes. iii. Therfore we mortal men special¦ly are taught and īstructed with ho∣ly scripture / to knowe our selfe. For who that knoweth hym selfe / shall knowe god: and he yt knoweth god / shall be likened to god: truly he shal be likened to god / that is goddis ser∣uant: he is goddis seruāt / that doth nothyng contrary to goddis cōman∣dement / but that he thynketh be {per}∣teynynge
to god: he speketh as he thynketh / and dothe as he speketh: whiche thynge no man may do effe∣ctually / with out perpetuall conty∣nuance in goodnes. iiii. No man shulde glorifie or delite in the nobilite of his kyndrede. For why / both riche and poure be ingen¦dred of erthe. Therfore no mā ought to exalte and prayse his vile & erthly kyndrede / but onely glorifie and re∣ioyce in good and godly maners. v. O mā loke and knowe thou / that the higher thou art by goddis helpe in dignite: so moche thou arte more in his dette: therfore thanke thy be∣nefactour therof / whiche acceptethe that is due to him as merite / and for frendshyppe doth frendshyppe: god is always the first that gyueth / and yet as he were our detter / he quiteth
agayn our goodnes to hym shewed. onely requirynge for his gentylnes and kyndenes to vs / effectuall loue and thankes. vi. Truly ther is nothyng that ma¦keth a man so cōmendable or preyse worthy / as to do / that he desyreth to do: and to wyll and do / that is good and rightous. Consyderynge than that this power is gyuen the by al∣mighty god / of the whiche in our be halfe thou haddest great nede: thou shalte wyll and do nothynge / but as god (that hath gyuen the suche fa∣culte and power) wylleth and com∣maundeth. For truely nothynge is more pleasant both to god and man / than to do iustice. 7. The vnstedfastnes of these world¦ly riches ensue and folowe the cours of flowyng waters / whiche ryches
he shall possesse & enioye but a while that thynketh hȳ selfe of them most sure. For shortely after / with the fal∣lyng water / they wyll leue hym and enriche some other. Therfore good and mercifull dedes be to man most sure and stedfaste: for the merite of them returneth euermore to the pro¦fite of the good dede doers. viii. Bicause of this high & worldly empere thou art harde to be spoken with all: and yet by reason of suche power thou shuldest humiliate thy selfe: and therfore ye spedilier admyt poure mē to thy speche and presence. Thou shalte therfore the sooner (fo∣lowing goddis rules) listen to poure men / that god maye in thy necessite bothe kyndly harken to the / and also helpe the. For loke howe we order o∣ther / so of god we shal be ordred.
ix. The pēs;iful and troubled mynde of an emperour muste be euermore as pure as the glas / that so hit may by diuine and godly lyght / continu∣ally glyster & shyne: and also that he by quietnes of mynde may lerne di∣stincte and true knowelege of thyn∣ges. For truely there is nothynge yt causeth man so wel to marke and be holde what is to be done / as a quiete mynde and clere conscience. x. Lyke as the mariner / a lytell go∣ynge out of cours / hurteth & is noy∣full to those that sayle with hym: & as the shyppe by negligence of the gouernour peryssheth and goeth to wracke: euen so do the citees. For if a subiecte do amys / he hurteth hym selfe more greuously than the welth publyke: but whan the ruler / the go¦uernour / or prince mysdoeth / he hur¦teth
ye holle cōmunalte: Therfore for as moche as he must gyue a strayte counte if he rule nat well: hit were nedefull that he with exquysite dili∣gence both speke & do euery thynge / and so auoyde all danger. xi The cercle & whele of these world¦ly thynges be often tymes turned / the whiche are turned somtime this way somtyme that way. Truely in these thynges is no equalite: for in them is neither constāce nor yet any sure fūdaciō. Therfore o most migh∣ty emperour amonge these change∣able mouynges / and vnstedynes of thynges / loke that thou haue a sted∣faste thought and mynde / with true feythe and pitie. xii. Thou shalt flie and withstande the entycyng cōmunicacion of flat∣terers / as thou woldeste eschewe a
sort of rauening crowes. For crowes pecke out the corporal eies: but flat∣terers blinde the vnderstandynge of mans soule / whan they wyll nat suf∣fre hym to {per}ceyue the trouthe of thȳ∣ges: for either they preyse thynges that are worthy to be dispreised / or els dispreise thinges most worthy to be preysed: so that one of these two must nedes folowe / that is / either ye commendacion and laude of yll and wicked caytyues / orels the cōtempt and dispreyse of good men. xii. An emperours mynde must al∣way be constant. For why / to chāge with euery wauerȳg and vnstedfast thinge / is a token of an inconstaunt minde. Therfore thou shuldest cleue and affixe thy selfe to good and ver∣tuous men / whiche shall stablishe & make stedfaste thy kyngdome & em∣pere.
Nor thou shuldest nat proudly eleuate thy selfe / nor yet without re∣son to moche submytte thy selfe: but prudently after the vse and custome of wise men / surely to groūde the in¦constance. For who so euer grondely thynkethe vpon the disceitfulnes of this lyfe: and wyll also beholde the vilenes and shortnes therof: consy∣derynge farthermore the bodily fyl∣thines / he wyll neuer waxe proude / be he in neuer so high a dignite. xiiii. Aboue all other precious orna∣mentis that any kyngdome hath / ye crowne of pite and of diuyne seruice dothe most hight and ornate a kyn∣gis and an emperours maieste. For why / erthely richesse / fauour of the cōmunalte / laude & preyse do soone vanishe away / but the glorie of good and vertuous life / is immortall / and
shall neuer be forgotte. xv. Me thynketh hit moche vncon∣uenient / that the poore man and the riche shulde suffre like harme by cō∣trarye and dyuers causes: the riche by abundance and great welfare are corrupted: ye poure perishe through famyne and scarsite. Farther more the riche possesseth al the worlde / the poure man hath nat where he maye set his foote. Therfore / to the entent that they bothe may be holpe / they must be ruled by deduction / that is / the riche muste gyue to the poure: & so the inequalite shall be brought to equalite. xvi. The tyme and season of prospe∣rous life / whiche certeyne olde pro∣phettis dyd {pro}nosticate shulde come / whan wyse men shulde gouerne and rule / or kynges waxe philosophers /
is nowe manifested and opened: for truely you gyuynge nowe and appli¦yng your selfe to philosophie & wyse∣dome / are estemed worthy to be ru∣lers: but specially whan in your au∣ctorite and gouerning / ye decline nat frō reason & wysedome. For if to loue wisedome maketh the philosopher / and the begynnyng of wisedome is the fere of god / whiche ye must euer more remēbre: who can say / but my writing is true / & as clere as true? xvii. For certeyne we affirme the to be an emperour / seinge thou wylt o∣uercome & subdue thy voluptuous pleasures. and than thou arte crow∣ned with the deme of Chastite / & thā thou shewest thy selfe arayed wt the urpul robe of Iustice. As for al other thinges vanishe away: these vertues be immortall: al other plea¦sures
and worldly dignites peryshe: but as these vertues be fer frō al pe∣rell / so they be euerlastyng. xviii. If thou wylt be beloued & ho∣nored of all men / loke thou helpe all men. For certeynly ther is nothyng that causeth a mā to be beloued and honored so soone / as to helpe and suc¦cour poure mē: for ye capping & kne∣lyng that is done for feare / is fucate & figured flattery of feyned honour. xix. Thy empere by all right & rea∣son is therfore the more worthy to be honored and preysed / that it feareth and kepeth his ēnemies vnder: and shewing to his subiectis al kyndnes kepeth them in good {pro}sperite. Ther¦fore as it ouercometh his ēnmies by strengthe of armes / so his subiectes by charite and good loue surmoūt & ouercome his gentylnes & goodnes:
truly betwene these .ii. kyndes of hu¦manite & loue is no more difference / than is betwene the tame shepe and other wylde beastis. xx. Though an emperour ī body be like all other / yet in power he is lyke god / & maister of al men. For in erthe he hath no pere. Therfore as god be thou neuer chafed or angry / as man be thou neuer proude. For though yu be like god ī face / yet for al that thou art but erthe: whiche thing techeth the to be egall to euery man. xxi. Accept and fauour them ye gyue the good coūsaile / but nat those that flatter the: good coūseilers consyder what ought to be done: flatterers cō¦syder what may please mē of might: whiche flatterers are like mens sha∣dowes: for they gaynesay nothyng / but alowe & preise what euer is said.
xxii. Be so to thyne / as thou woldest that god shulde be to the. For as we here other / so we shall be harde / & as we fauour other / so god wyll fauour vs. Therfore let vs fyrst shewe mer∣cy and be mercifull / that in lyke ma∣ner we may opteyne mercy. xxiii. As a fayre glasse expresseth the very true fisnomy of man / that is of goodly & beutifull {per}sons theyr beuti¦fulnes: and of yll fauored theyr yl fa¦uour: so the rightousnes & equite of god is likened to our dedes. For after our dedes / god wyll rewarde vs. xxiiii. Do that y•e entende coldly / but yet do hit spedily yt ye purpose to do. For folishe hastynes in euery thinge is very perillous. Truly who yt mar¦keth diligentely / what mischiefe ry∣seth of hastynes / shal soone {per}ceyue & like wise vnderstāde the cōmodite of
good coūseile / as sicke folke aft theyr sickenes vnderstande the pleasure of helthe. Therfore most prudēt prince with sage coūseile and deuoute pray¦ers made to god / loke thou diligent∣ly serche and inquere what shalbe {pro}¦fitable for the / to rule and gouerne this worlde. xxv. Thou shalt best gouerne thy no¦ble empere / if thou ouerse al thinges thy selfe / & suffre nothing negligētly to passe. Nor it is nat a small thinge in the / that in cōparison of thy sub∣iectes appereth to be smalle. For the leest worde of an emperour / is amōg all folkes right highly estemed / and of great auctorite. xxvi. Bicause ther is no erthly man that can cōstraine the to obserue and kepe thy lawes / enforce thy selfe to vse & kepe them. For if thou diligētly
obserue them / thou shalt manifestly shewe / that the lawe is worthy to be obserued / and the breker of hit / wor∣thy to be punyshed. xxvii. It is one thinge to syn / & nat to chastise synners. For who so euer dwelleth in a cite / & ther in suffreth wicked liuers / before god he is an yl lyuer. Therfore if thou wylt be este∣med to be indifferent / honor them yt do well / & punyshe them that do yll. xxviii. I thynke hit very expediēt to eschewe yl company. For who yt is cō¦uersant with yll lyuers / shall eyther suffre harme / or lerne some yll. But he that leadeth his lyfe amōge good & honest cōpany / eyther he shal lerne to folowe honestie / orels to diminishe his fautes and vices. xxix. Sith it is so yt god hath gyuen to the rule of al the worlde / loke yu vse
no yl officers. For he that promoteth them shal answere for theyr offēces. Therfore great offices must be deli∣gētly gyuē / & wel & wisely bestowed. 30. I esteme these two thinges to be lyke yll / to be chafed with ye leude de∣ling of our ēnemie / or to be mollified with the plesant swete wordis of our frēdes. For we ought to resist & with stande them bothe / that is / neuer to decline frō comelines / nother in reuē¦gyng the vnresonable yll wyll of our foos / nor in rewarding the feyned be¦niuolence of our frende and louer. 31. Esteme nat those thy feythful frē¦des / that wyl preyse al thinges that thou spekest: but those / whiche with out any feyning / do all that they can for the: and be glad & reioyce / whan thou sayest or dost any thynge well / & agayne be sory & heuy / if thou do or
say yll. For certayne these betokens of frendship aborryng all fraude. 32. Let nat the greatnes & might of this thy erthly empere chāge thy no¦ble mynde / but ruling thy frayle em¦pere / and subiect to diuers fortunes / haue amōge these mutable thinges a stedfast and īmutable mynde / nat lyfting vp thy selfe by to moche ioy / nor yet hurtȳg thy selfe by to moche heuynes & sorowe. For lyke as golde though it by crafte & wytte of mā be turned nowe thus nowe other wise / & wrought in diuers fashions of or∣namentes: yet hit remayneth golde styl nor wyl nat be chāged from his nature: so thy selfe most noble empe¦rour / though frō grice to grice haste borne one office after an other / & arte come to the most highest honor / yet thou remaynest ye same thinge thou
were. Kepe yu therfore amonge these diuersites of thinges an inalterable and a cōstant mynde / the whiche frō this worldly empere / shal bringe the to {per}petuall blys & ioye euerlastinge. 33. If thou wylt haue ye dominiō of thy empere cōmended / deme thyne owne offences as worthy punysshe∣mēt as ye defautes of thy subiectis. For in this worlde no man / but only thyn owne consciēce can punishe the. 34. He that opteyneth high power and dignite shulde ensue & folowe as nere as he may / ye gyuer therof. For if themperour represent god / lorde of al thinge / and by his liberalite hath the gouernance of euery thinge: he than (but namely ī this poynt) shall folow hym / & esteme no erthly thȳg so precious / or so moche of man to be desired / as to be mylde & mercifull.
35. Aboue golde and precious stone we shuld lay vp as treasure ye riches of well doing. For they in this p̄sent lyfe / through hope of the fruicion to come wyll delite vs: and in ye lyfe to come / by experience and tast of euer∣lasting ioy / they shalbe to vs swete & pleasant. These worldly thinges / ye seme to vs pleasant / shuld be eschew¦ed and vtterly auoyded / as vnmete / and nothing {per}teyninge to vs / yt they by enticement disceyue vs nat. 36. Loke thou quite them with gay rewardes / whiche with good wyl do thy cōmandemētes. For by ye meane thou shalt encreace ye corage of good men / and teache ye yldoers to lament theyr offences. For it were to moche vniuste deling to reward alike aswel them ye deserued nat as deserued it. 37. Than truly the empere excedeth
all other thinges / whan ye ruler ther¦of enclyneth nat to vndiscrete cruel∣nes / but to amiable equite & iustice / fleynge beastly cruelnes / and ensu∣yng godly kyndnes. 38. Aswel thou shalt iuge rightfully thy ēnemy as thy frēde / nat fauorȳg thy frēde for frendshyp / nor hurtyng thy ēnemy for hatred. For it is a like incōueniēce and offence / to helpe thy frēde desiryng that is agaynst eqte / as it is to hurte thy ēnemy demaun∣ding iustice: ye misdede in both cases is like / though ye {per}sones be dyuers. 39. Iuges must diligently harken to their causes. For hit is a very harde thinge breuely to {per}ceyue ye trouthe / the whiche frō negligēt {per}sons soone skapeth. But if a rightful iuge wyll leaue the feyned eloquence of attour∣neis / and cōsidering the true entēciō
wyl flie ye likelyhod of causes / he shal shortly {per}ceyue ye trouth. And farther¦more auoyde .ii. diuers fautes / that is / they shal neither do / nor yet {per}mit any other to do agaynst honestie. xl. Though thou haue as many ver¦tues / as be sterris ī ye firmamēt / yet thou shalt neuer ouercome the good∣nes of god. For what so euer we offer to god / we offer to hȳ but his owne. And as no mā can go fro or before his shadowe in ye son / alway going afore or nere folowing hym: so ye goodnes of god is insuperable / and can nat be exceded wt good warkes of any man. xli. The treasure of liberalite is infi∣nite. For who that liberally spēdeth getteth / and spending his goodes o∣ther gether them. Loke than most li¦beral emperour: yt thou mynde those thinges: and that thou gyue large∣ly
to poure men. For whan the tyme of rewardes and thākes shall come / thā for this thy liberalite / thou shalt haue infinite thankes & great luker. xlii. Seing thou haste opteyned and gotten thy kyngdome by god / folow thou hym in all good warkes / that men may knowe thy liberalite. For thou art of the numbre of them that may do good / & nat of poure mē and those that couet to be holpē. For god therfore hath gyuen the so abundāt riches to helpe & succour poure men. xliii. An emperour is no otherwise or¦deyned to rule the worlde / thā mans eies to rule and watche for the saue∣garde of his body. He is deputed of god to ministre those thynges / that may be profitable for mā. Therfore an emperour ought to do none other¦wise for al men / than he wolde do for
hym selfe: that so by his tuiciō they may auoyde al dangers / and {pro}spere in goodnes. xliiii. Thynke thou the most sure de∣fence of thy {pro}sperite / to hurte nor to iniury no man. For he that offēdeth no man / suspecteth no man. If than to iniury no mā dothe cause good cu∣stody and sauegarde: then truely by liberalite thou shalt ye soner opteyne hit. For as liberalite getteth and en∣gēdreth defence: so it cōserueth good and honest loue. For if we do that is honest / men wyl loue and kepe vs. xlv. Be thou (o moste mekest empe∣roure) to thy subiectes through thy excellent power / terrible: and by thy liberalite and goodnes be thou ami∣able. Nor yu shuldest nat by to moche fauour / set at light and nothynge re∣gard thy high power: nor yet regar¦ding
to moche thy power / despise fa∣uour. But kepȳg a mean / thou shalt as well shewe louely kyndnes to thy subiectes / as by asperite & sharpnes chastise to great familiarite. xlvi. Suche thinges as yu by worde dost p̄scribe to thy subiectes / loke by example of pure life thou accōplishe. For if thou do reason / and with rea∣son doste lyue as thou sayest / euery man shall greatly cōmende the. xlvii. Loue them moste noble empe∣rour / that mekely desyre thy gyftes / more than those / whiche diligētly de¦sire to gyue ye gyftes. For these thou art boūde to thāke / & also to rewarde them: the other truly shal assine god to thāke ye / whiche reputeth to be gy¦uen to hym / & for his loue / what so e∣uer is gyuen or done for poure men. xlviii. The vertue of the son is to illu¦luminate
the worlde / themperours vertue is to be mercyfull / & to helpe poure men. Truly a meke & a merci∣ful prince excedeth ye brightnes of ye son: for ye son gyueth place to ye night but a good vertuous prince suffreth no extorciō / but by ye light of trouthe and iustice / he castiseth iniquite. xlix. Thy predecessours haue gretly ornated theyr empere / but thou tru∣ly by thy humanite & affabilite / nat esteming thy ryal & mighty power / hast moche more greatly ornated it. Wherfore al they yt nede mercy rūne to thy grace / whiche delyuered from theyr pouerte & aduersite / do highly thanke the. l. Loke how moche thou excellest al other in power & dignite / so moche ye more yu shuldst endeuer the / by noble & vertuous dedes to excelle & shyne
aboue all other. For high power req∣reth great honestie. God also wyl re∣quire / thou helpe (after thy power) nedefull and honest {per}sons. Therfore if yu desire to be truly preysed / & to be by god / as it were bi a trōpeter decla¦red a cōqueror: ioyne yu to ye crowne of thy inuincible ēpere / by helping ye poure) ye crowne of euerlasting ioye. li. Er thou cōmande that right and equite {per}suadeth / loke thou wel vpon it. For verily so thou shalt euermore cōmande that right is. Mans tōge is a very slippery instrumēt / ye whi∣che hath brought many one ī to gret perill & danger. Therfore if yu prefixe to the forsaid instrumēt yt is goodly & honest / hit shall soūde only yt is plea∣sant / & right to be executed & done. lii. A prince ī al thinges must be sub¦tile & wise / but namely in iuginge of
great & weighty causes / seldome an∣gry / and nat to be angry without a great cause. But bicause neuer to be angry is nat laudable / an emperour to refrayne the furiousnes of misdo∣ers / and yt men may purge theyr fau¦tes / shall measurably vse his anger. liii. Loke yu be diligēt to knowe {per}fetly the maners & cōdicions of thy seruā∣tes / & of all those / whiche charite en∣forceth the to loue. And also be yu dili∣gent to knowe those / whiche disceit∣fully do flatt ye. For oft tymes disceit∣ful louers & flaterers do great hurt. liiii. Whan so euer thou herest suche cōmunicacion or coūsaile / ye may pro¦fite / do nat only here hit / but also fo∣lowe it. For truly ye emperours ma∣ieste is than ornated / whan he hym selfe cōsidereth / what is necessary to be done: and despiseth nat other mēs
profitable inuecions & coūsayle / and is nat ashamed to lerne / and quicke∣ly executeth that he hath lerned. lv. As a castell / whiche by reason of his strōge walles is inuincible / and setteth light by his ēnemies: so thy empere / wel walled with liberalite & fortified with deuoute prayer / is in∣uīcible / and by goddis helpe shal tri∣umphe of his aduersares & ēnemes. lvi. Vse so this inferior kyngdome / that it may be to ye a way to ye kyng∣dome of heuen. For who so euer go∣uerneth well this erthly kingdome / is estemed worthy to opteyne celesti∣al ioye and pleasure. He ruletth this worlde rightfully / that charitably lo¦ueth his subiectes / and of his subie∣ctes is duely honored & dredde / and whā he procureth / that none occasiō of yll be amonge them.
lvii. Liberalite & charitable dedes is a {per}petual & incorrupt garmēt. Ther¦fore who so euer wyl raygne charita∣bly / must ornate and clothe his soule with suche goodly vesture and appa¦raile. For who that helpeth ye poure men / shal opteyne ioye euerlastinge. lviii. Cōsidring that god hath gyuen the / ye imperial sceptre / loke thou en∣deuer thy selfe vtterly to please him. And bicause he hath preferd ye aboue al other: thou must honor him aboue al other. Truly god estemeth hit the most singularst benefite yt thou canst do hym / to defende his creatures as thy selfe / and liberally to helpe them as bounde therto. lix. Euery man yt desireth his helthe must call vpon god / but specially the emperour / whiche laboureth for the welth of al men. And he defended by
god / shal as well ouercome his enne∣mies as defende his subiectes. lx. God nedeth nothing. An emperor hath onely nede of god. Therfore fo∣low him yt hath no nede / & shew mer∣cy abūdātly to them yt aske it. nat re∣kening straitly thy expēses of house hold: but rather helpe euery mā yt de¦sireth to liue. For it is better to helpe ye vnworthi for honest mēs sakis thā for ye vice of ye vnworthy to defraude the worthy of that they deserued. lxi. As yu woldest haue forgyuenes of thy synnes / so forgyue other yt the of∣fēde. God forgyueth them yt forgiue. & where forgiuenes is / there is god. lxii. A prince yt wold demene hȳ faut∣lesly / must diligētly take hede / yt his peple be vtuous / & yt he be ashamed to syn / & yt he giue no opē exāple to o∣ther to do ams / & yt he absteyne pri∣uatly
lest he offēd opēly. For if subie∣ctis be ashamed to do amys / moche more yeir ruler ought to be ashamed. lxiii. It is a priuat mās vice to do yll & liue viciously / but a prīce to forget his owne welth & honestie is moche more vicious. For ye abstinēce frō yll dothe nat iustifie mā / but ye doyng of honestie & goodnes. Therfore no mā shulde only absteyne frō yll / but also endeuer him to do iustice. lxiiii. Deth dredeth neither kyng nor emperor / but egally deuoureth eue∣ry mā. Therfore before his fearefull comyng / let vs gether our riches in heuē. For no mā can cary worldly ry∣ches thither / but all left in ertthe / he shal ther naked giue acōpt of his life lxv. As an ēperor is lorde of al mē / so wt all other he is goddis seruāt. And shall thā be called a lorde / whā he by
vtue of chastite ouercometh his sen∣sual lustis / & with an inuīcible mȳde despiseth the transitory pleasures & ioyes of this worlde. lxviii. As mās shadow foloweth the body / so syn foloweth ye soule: whiche soule ones seperated frō ye mortal bo∣dy / shal giue arekening to god of his good & yl dedes. Nor thā is no tyme to deny any thyng. For euery mans dede shal beare witnes / nat bi worde but representinge & openinge euery mans dede / as he dyd hit. lxix. As a shyp hauing winde at wyl brīgeth ye passagers oft times into ye hauē soner thā they wold a thought so ye swift time of this mortal life pas¦seth away / & we aproche to our ende: Therfore let vs leue to loue worldly thīges / whiche this world estemeth so moche / & let vs studi how to get to
ye port of heuē / where is no wayling / but eternal ioye and pleasure. lxx. No man bi reason of his dignite shuld be haute & proude / but cōside∣ring ye substāce of ye fleshe / shulde re∣presse the swelling pride of hart. For though he be made a prince ī erthe / yet he must mȳde / he was engēdred of erthe: & yt frō erthe he asēded to ye seate royal / & frō ye seate roial he shal agayne descēde to vilē erth & ashes. lxxi. Be neuer careles prince most ex¦cellēt. & as they yt go vp a ladder stint nat til they come to ye highest rōge or grice: so yu desiring to haue vtu / shul dest neuer cesse tyl yu cōe to ye kingdōe of heuē. Whiche thing Christe / ye ke∣per and encrecer of all thing (whose name mē shall glorifie & preise etnal∣ly) grant the & ye empresse thy wife.
