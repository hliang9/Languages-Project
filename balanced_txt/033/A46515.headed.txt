I7 R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms By the King A PROCLAMATION. JAMES R. IAMES the Seventh by the Grace of GOD, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all and sundry Our good Subject whom these Presents do or may Concern, Greeting. Where∣as by Our Royal Proclamation of the date the 12 day of February 1686/7 We were graciously pleased for the Causes, and on the Terms therein mentioned, to grant Our Royal Tolleration to the Professors of the Christian Religion therein named; With and under certain Restrictions and Limitations; All which are in the said Proclamation more at length expressed: We now taking into Our Royal Consideration the sinistruous Interpretations, which either have, or may be made of some Restrictions, therein mentioned. Have thought fit by this Our Royal Proclamation, fur∣ther to Declare, that We will Protect Our Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, and all Our Subjects of the Protestant Religion, in the free Exercise of their Protestant Religion, as it is by Law Established, and in the Quiet and Full Injoyment of all their Possessi∣ons, without any Molestation or Disturbance whatsoever. And We do likewise by Our Soveraign Authority, Prerogative-Royal, and Absolute Power, Suspend, Stop and Disable, all Penal and Sanguinary Laws, made against any for Non-confor∣mity to the Religion Established by Law, in that Our Ancient Kingdom, or for Exercising their respective Worships, Religi∣ons, Rites and Ceremonies; All which Laws are hereby Stopt, Suspended and Disabled to all Intents and Purposes. And to the end that by the Liberty thereby granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice thereof, may not be Endangered, We have thought fit, and do hereby straitly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects, that as We do give them leave to Meet and Serve God after their own Way and Manner, be it in privat Houses, Chappels, or Places purposely Hired or Built for that use, so that they take care that nothing be Preached or Taught among them which may any ways tend to Alienat the Hearts of Our People from Us, or Our Government, and that their Meetings be peaceable, openly and publick∣ly held, and all Persons freely admitted to them, and that they do signifie and make known to some one or more of the next Privy Counsellors, Sheriffs, Stewards, Baillies, Justices of the Peace, or Magistrats of Burghs-Royal, what Place or Places they set a part for these uses, with the Names of the Preachers. And that all Our Subjects may enjoy such their Religious Assemblies with greater assurance and protection, We have thought fit, and do hereby Command, that no Disturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under pain of Our Royal displeasure, and to be further proceeded against with the outmost severity; Provided always, that their Meetings be in Houses, or Places provided for the purpose, and not in the open Fields, for which now after this Our Royal Grace and Favour shown (which surpasses the Hopes, and equals the very Wishes of the most zealously concerned) there is not the least shadow of excuse left; Which Meetings in Fields We do hereby strictly prohibite and forbid, against all which We do leave Our Laws and Acts of Parliament in full force and vigour, notwithstanding the Premisses; And do further Command all Our Judges, Magistrats, and Officers of Our Forces, to prosecute such as shall be guilty of the saids Field-Conventicles or Assemblies with the outmost Rigour, as they would avoid Our Highest Displeasure; For We are confident none will, after these Liberties and Freedoms We have given to all, without reserve, to serve God in their own way, presume to meet in these Assemblies, except such as make a pretence of Religion, to cover their Treasonable Designs against Our Royal Person, and the Peace of Our Government. And Lastly, To the end all Our good Subjects may have notice of this Our Royal Will and Pleasure, We do hereby Command Our Lyon King at Arms, and his Brethren Heraulds, Macers, Pursevants, and Messengers at Arms, to make timeous Proclamation thereof at the Mercat-Cross of Edinburgh: And besides the Printing and Publishing of this Our Royal Proclamation, It is Our express Will and Pleasure, that the same be past under Our Great Seal of that Our Kingdom per saltum, without passing any other Seal or Register.
