Your reward shall be, for giving us bread to feed our Bodies, the food of Angels to refresh your Souls: for giving us water to quench our thirst, you shall tast of the Well of Life: and forbeing good to us Prisoners, you shall be made free Denizons of that old and glorious City Jerusalem. Therefore doe as God shall move your hearts: and so blessed be his Name for all our good Benefactors. We most humbly pray and beseech, that your Charity may be put into this Bearers Box, sealed with the House-Seal, as it is figured upon this Petition, Printed by J.
