C R DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon surmounted by a crown and flanked by the English lion and Tudor rose on one side and the Scottish unicorn and thistle on the other ❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation to restraine the transportation of Corne, Wooll, Wooll-fells, Fullers earth, and Leather. THe Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE taking into consideration the manifold euil practises, which for priuate gaine are too often put in vre, as well by Corne-masters & Hoorders of Corne, as by merchants and others, to inhance the prices of Corne and Graine to the generall pre∣iudice of all other his Maiesties Subiects, especially labouring men, and those of the poorer sort, which hath appeared not onely in the time of the late dearth, but in the yeere now past, when by the good∣nesse of God, there was such plenty and abundance of Corne as seldom hath been greater; and yet the rates and prices of Corne in many parts of this Kingdome, (espe∣cially in the Citie of London and the parts neere adioyning) were kept vp at farre higher prices, then was fit to be, in a time of so great & generall plenty; And that howsoeuer by the prouident & constant care of His Maiestie, & His priuie Councell, transportation of Corne was restrained euen in that plentifull yeere; yet in many parts of the Kingdome, false rumors were and are spread and divulged, of great transportation of Corne licensed and authorised, to the great dishonour of His Maiestie, and the State, and of a wicked purpose to keepe vp Corne and Graine at immode∣rate prices; His Maiestie, with the aduice of His Priuie Councell, doth hereby publish and de∣clare, That all the said rumors were most false, vntrue, and scandalous, and that the Authors and divulgers thereof, haue iustly incurred His Maiesties displeasure, and the seuere censure of His Lawes, which His Maiestie doeth hereby require and command to be strictly and seuerely inflicted vpon all such as haue or shall offend in that behalfe, by all and singular his Iudges, Iu∣stices, Magistrates, Officers and ministers to whom it doeth appertaine, that by their example, others may be deterred from the like presumption, in time to come. And albeit His Maiestie is well satisfied that by the remaining store of the last yeere, and by the increase of this present yeere, there is very ample & good prouision of Corne, sufficient to supply the whole Kingdom at easie and reasonable prices; yet considering the want of Corne in diuers other parts beyond the Seas, might occasion a transportation thereof from hence, which would necessarily draw on an in∣hancement of prices if it should be permitted; Therefore his Maiestie holding it necessary to pro∣uide,
that his owne Subiects in generall may enioy the good blessing of plenty which God hath vouchsafed to this Realme, and that the same be not turned to the inriching onely of a few gree∣die Cormorants, doth by like Aduice of His Priuie Councell, prohibite and forbid, that from henceforth for the space of one yeere next ensuing, and from the end of that yeere, vntill his Ma∣iestie shall declare His pleasure to the contrary, no Corne or Graine be transported, or carried out of this his Maiesties Realme of England, or Dominion of Wales, vnto any other part or place whatso∣euer, vpon paine of his Maiesties indignation and displeasure, and of such punishments to be inflic∣ted aswel vpon the offendors themselues, their Ayders, Procurers, Abbettors and Fauorers, whe∣ther they be Iustices of Peace, Officers of his Maiesties Customes or Ports, or any other whoso∣euer, as so high a contempt and offence doeth demerit. And because His Maiestie is informed, that in diuers Counties of this Realme neare the Sea Coast, it hath been practised to buy and prouide great quantity of Corne, and bring the same vnto, or neare the Sea-Coast ready for transportation, and then in some one or two markets to sell some small quantitie thereof, or of other Corne at lower prices then the same were bought, and vpon some faint and partiall certificate from some Iustices of Peace, or other officers, that Corne in those Markets was sold vnder the rates limited by the Statute, haue procured the same to be transported beyond the Seas; His Maiestie requireth by like Aduice of His Priuie Councell, that those and all other fraudulent practises vnduely to procure Transportation of Corne hereto∣fore committed, or hereafter to be committed; be strictly and diligently inquired and looked into, and condigne punishment inflicted vpon all offenders therein. And whereas His Maiestie is informed, that sundry Merchants, Strangers, and Aliens of Forreigne Countreys in Amitie with His Maiestie, haue accustomed to bring their Shippes and Vessells into some of the Ports, Hauens, or Creekes of this Realme vnuictualed, of purpose, that vnder colour of taking in a supply of fresh victuals for their necessities, they might victuall them∣selues and their Ship-company from hence for their voyages, whereby they carry away much Corne, Beefe, and other victualls, and prohibited Commodities, which is an equall mischiefe with Transportation; His Maiestie doeth hereby declare, and command, that the same bee not hereafter suffered to bee done. Notwithstanding, if any such Aliens or Strangers, shall by di∣stresse of weather, or other ineuitable Accident, be driuen into any of the Ports, Hauens, Creekes, or Harbours of this Realme, His Maiestie is well pleased, that they shall haue liberty to prouide and take vp such quantities of victualls, and other necessaries, as shall be sufficient for their neces∣sary sustenance in their returne thence into their owne Countrey onely, and not otherwise. And further His Maiestie doeth by like aduice of His Priuy Councell, straitly prohibite and forbid, That no Wooll, Wooll-Fells, Fullers-earth, tanned Leather, or raw Hides be at any time hereafter transported, or carried out of this His Maiesties Realme of England, or Dominion of Wales, vnto any other Port, or Place whatsoeuer, vpon paine of His Maiesties indignation and displeasure, vnder such punishments to be inflicted, aswell vpon the Offenders themselues, their Ayders, Procurers, Abbettors, and Fauourers, whether they be Iustices of Peace, Offi∣cers of His Maiesties Customes or Ports, or any other whosoeuer, as so high a contempt and of∣fence doeth demerite. And His Maiestie being likewise informed, that great and manifold abuses haue beene commit∣ted in times past, aswell by the corruption, or negligence in the inferiour Officers and ministers of His Maiesties Customes, aswell in permitting Wooll, Wooll-Fells, and Fullers-earth, to be transported; As also touching transportation of Corne, Leather, and raw Hides, in permitting the same to passe, either without any Licence, or in greater quantities then hath beene Licensed,
or in suffering the same to passe beyond the Seas, vnder colour of transportation from Port to Port within the Realme; His Maiestie doeth in like maner Will and Command, that all abuses in that behalfe, either heretofore done, or hereafter to be done, be strictly and diligently enquired, found out, and punished. And for auoyding the like in time to come, His Maiestie willeth and Commandeth, that no transportation of any Corne, Wooll, Wooll-Fells, Fullers-earth, Lea∣ther, or raw Hides from Port to Port within this Realme bee permitted, but vpon good bonds with sufficient Sureties responsall, and resident within the Realme, for whose sufficiencie, the Officers of His Maiesties Customes taking the same bonds, will bee answerable; In the con∣dition of which Bonds, the true quantity of the Corne, and Fullers-earth, and the number and weight of the bags or sackes of Wooll, and number of Wooll-Fells, Hides, and Leather ship∣ped to bee carried from Port to Port, shall bee set downe; And that no Certificate of the landing thereof, or of landing any Wooll out of Ireland, bee made vpon an entry alone, either at sight or otherwise, before such time as the goods bee landed, and then the Certificate to containe the iust quantity, weight, and numbers of them so landed, and no more. And to the intent the Customers and Officers of His Maiesties Ports, executing their places by deputies, may not shift off the of∣fences aforesaid, or others of like nature (when they happen to bee discouered) vpon their depu∣ties, ministers, or seruants, who haue little or nothing to be answerable for their offences; His Maiestie doeth signifie and declare His will and pleasure, that in euery such case, euery person or persons, shall according to the Law be answerable aswell for his owne offences, as for the faults of his and their deputies, ministers, and seruants, by forfeiture and seizure of their Offices, or otherwise in the seuerest and strictest wayes that by the lawes of the Realme are appointed or permitted, without any fauour or conniuence. And because His Maiestie is desirous, that this His gracious prouidence and prouision should receiue due effect for the generall Weale of His people, His Maiestie is pleased, if any person or persons will at any time hereafter disclose or discouer vnto His Maiesties Priuy Councell, or to the Lord High Treasurer of England, or to His Maiesties Attorney Generall, any persons that haue offended either in spreading such rumours as aforesaid, or in transporting of Corne, Victu∣alls, Wooll, Wooll-Fells, Fullers-earth, Leather, or raw Hides contrary to His Maiesties Pro∣clamation, or any Law, or other Proclamation formerly published in that behalfe, and will pro∣duce sufficient proofe for the conuicting of the said offenders, that in euery such case, the one halfe of the fine and summes of money forfeited, or to bee imposed vpon the said offenders shall bee al∣lowed vnto the party or parties making such discouery, as His Maiesties free bounty and reward. His Maiestie doeth hereby authorize aswell the Lord Treasurer, Chancelor, and Barrons of His Exchequer, as all other Iudges, Iustices, Officers and Ministers of any other His Courts of Iustice whatsoeuer, to whom it shall appertaine, without any further or other Warrant, to giue order for the leuying, issuing, paying, and deliuering of the said moyety of the fines, and summes of money according to His Maiesties gracious pleasure herein declared as aforesaid. Giuen at Our Honour of Hampton Court, the last day of September, in the eighth yeere of Our Reigne. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE: And by the Assignes of IOHN BILL. M.DC.XXXII.
