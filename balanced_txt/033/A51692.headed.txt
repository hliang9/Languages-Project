A malicious Rich Man makes acceptable pleasant Reasons, and most People for Money take the rich Villain by the hand. Pray, Money or no Money, right or wrong yea, like the green and withering Leaves, ill perswaded, ill designing, shie, other∣wise busie or not; read from the first to the last word in this present Case nicely, and attentively, before giving your judgment in it. And order the Speaker or Chair-man in a Committee of a full or not full House, to give the Petitioner, at your Bar, your Answer to it before your Honours, between the Hours of two and three of the Clock in the Afternoon. To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Parliament assembled, The humble Petition of Prince Butler, a woful, persecuted, beaten, pushed, thump∣ed, bruised, and sickly, 26 Years Vagabond, lying in Garrets, more for cheapness then for ease. 14 Years a fluxing more in cold than hot weather, a groaning, grunt∣ing, and frightfully sighing to the hearers near him above three years, and doubts will last during life, day and night in his Bed, in the Streets, in the Fields, and to his great Sorrow, and more trouble, very often in strange Company, like a stabb'd, ready, presently dying Man, and in cold windy weather, like to be choaked with Smoke. If he is a Fool, the Pope and all the Kings and Councils in their Council-Chambers and people in Europe are Fools, except King William, and ill perswaded, ill design∣ing, ignorant, or not People. The Case and matter of fact of Prince Butler, an Ac∣count of what Blood he lost in 4 Years time, by reason of unexpected beatings, kicks in the legs, pushes and thumps in the breast as he can remember, besides long phy∣sicking, dieting, exercising, purging, vomiting and fasting, and not yet well cured, in all 497 Ounces and a half of Butchers weight, besides what he must lose in cold weather, and for what may happen; it is better to lose offensive Blood than life, all the said blood, besides offensive pinches, showers of greasie Bones and other nastinesses thrown at him; hard Bulls out of a trunk Cane blown at his Head, many slaps, reflections, vexatious, scandalous reports, affronts, and aspersions, he lost, and endured very often unexpectedly in London, to the great pleasure and content of him and them, ill per∣swaded, ill designing, bribed or not, as may by a word hinder as order and encou∣rage it, without regarding the Petitioner's, God help him, serious, sober, and earnest Prayers to shoot him with a Gun or Pistol through the Head, which ye may judge is enough to weaken a Sampson, a Stone-Horse, or a Town-Bull, and much more your tame and innocent weak Petitioner, not yet out of pain and danger, daily a trembling from the bottom of the Skye to the top of the Ground, for fear any part or all the said Misfortunes may happen to him again, besides many troubles he endured out of England, in 26 years Persecution, not yet, nor like ever to be ended, if not assisted by your Honours and the King. Wherefore he humbly prays your Honours to desire his Majesty, by an Address, by his Secretary, or Members of his Privy Council in your House, to give him a ge∣neral open Letter to his Ambassadors abroad, that the Ambassador where he arrives, may; Money or no Money, right or wrong, desire the King or Prince, with his Se∣cretary, to hear the Petitioner ead his grievances publickly or privately before them, and after a clear Hearing, to answer him as they please. And the said Ambassador may give him Bed and Bread, Money or no Money, right or wrong, without As∣persions, Backbitings, Affroats, Blows and Reflections from his Servants, young and old Men and Women upon Oath, until he gets his Answer, in or not in writing from Court. And he prays your Honours to desire his Majesty to give him ra∣velling Money to Vienna, the Emperor's Court, And he will pray.
