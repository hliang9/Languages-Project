❧ Die Jovis 21. die Octobris. 1641. WHereas upon the Lords meeting after their late Recesse, finding that there are many Petitions depending in the House, and con∣ceiving that many more may come in, which may occasion the re∣pair and attendance of divers of His Majesties Subjects at this place: their Lordships have thought fit, and accordingly have ordered it, That because of the danger of Infection, and because there are many publike businesses of great importance in agita∣tion, which concern the safety and weale of the Kingdom, that all private businesses be deferred and put off till the thirtieth of November next. Whereof their Lordships do hereby give publike notice to the whole Kingdom, to prevent the charge and trouble which other∣wise the Petitioners might be put unto in repairing hither. ¶Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of John Bill. 1641
