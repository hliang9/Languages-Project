FRom Spaine out of Madril is written of the 10. hereof / that the Prince Philibert of Savoyen was departed from thence / taking his waye to Divares / to depart from thence with the Galleys of the Marquis of S. Crois / with his Father and Brothers to Thurn / to handel of his Majesties part / and hath first 50 thousand Ducates of his Majesties part / and for his maintaining 60 thousand ducats. The Spanish Sea is full of Pyrots / dooing great damage. Those Galleys / that remayned behinde at Ha∣vana with the Plates of Silver are at last arri∣ved at Sivile. And 7. millions of golde was pre∣paring this new yeare for provision of the war∣res in Germany, From Venice, the 25. hereof. From Naples is written / that the Cardinal Borgin was departed from thence to Roome / because the Cardinal Sappata was in his jour∣ney to Naples as new Dice King / resolved to do there his solenme entring. The preparations of warre / as wel in the Kingdome of Napels as in the Land of Milan / are furthered with all speede and dilegence / whereunto great provision of money frō Spaine is remitted / to what purpose or intent the King will employe / shall be knowen / as they meane / at the arrival of the Prince of Savoy / expedited with the Title of Ditarius of the Kingdome / which they saye shall have with him a Counsel / with whome hee shalk have power to resolve and do all things he shal find good / without staying for order out of Spaine. From venize the 26 hereof. Mons de Molausan / the Ambassadour of the King of Fraunce / is with great complements receaved of the King of Spaine / and with a good answer dispatched / and honoured with a gift of a golden chayne of 10000 Crownes. From venize the 1 of Ianuarij, 1621. From Mylan newes is come / that 700 thou∣sand Crowns should be payed to the Gover∣nour of Grnua / and his Maiestie likewise should handle with the sayde Geneveses / that they should furnish the sayde Governour with 3 mil∣lions of gold. This Governour hath commaun∣demenes strongly to arme. His Maiestie hath eke retained the third part of the Marchaunts of the West-Iudische Fleet / but offered for that unto them the custome of the Selt / which in that Countrey importeth 260 thousand Crowns. At Paris is Mansieur Priuli / Ambassadour of the Denetians / very stately brought to the au∣dience to whome concerning Deltlm al required help is promised. From Vienna, the 27 of December, 1620. The Lord Charles van Sherin remayneth yet heere / that hath denounced unto his Majestie in the name of the Moravish States / that first they should have a safe conduct. Secondly / a ge∣neral pardon and remission. Thirdly / that into their Countrey there should not be brought men of warre. For this they offer and have presented to receive his Majestie / whereupon this resolu∣tion is taken: that notwithstanding they first where not worthy / neverthelesse it should be graunted unto them / if they should shew them∣selves obedient / those that have beene cause / his Majestie will not pardon / but shall be punished to an exampel of others. The men of warre should be brought into the Countrey / but none should suffer damage / but those that should withstand. Whereupon some of the States and Communs have declared themselves / but others would not trust to it / and are departed till a sure pardon be given / and therefore the whole armey is lying in Moravia / to consirayne the rebelles to obedience / and march to Brin / but some saye that 15 thousand men of warre expect them the∣re. Likewise at Spalits / Olmits and other pla∣ces are some thousands / that are resolved to withstande the Emperour looking yet for many 1000. to do a great expedition. From vienna the 28 of December, 1620. They saye yet that Moravia should be delive∣red to the Maiestie / but with certaine conditions but his Maiestie will not accept them / but with condition of grace and disgrace / whereupon they have sent hither Ambassadours to further pro∣ceedings / but they are taken by the waye of the Hungarians and some of them are slaine / not∣withstanding they shewed Patent Letters of the Emperour / whereupon answer is given unto them / that they where arrant knaves / they have therefore written hither / that they can not come / and they meane that the Morabians with this handling seeke but to winne time / and that Bet∣lem hath assisted them with 5000 men. The Earle of Bucquoy is yet at Iglou / and the Armey of the Emperour at the siege of a strong Castle not far from Brin. His Maiestie hath revoked againe the required Capital censure. This Land-daye heere goeth yet forward / and his Maiestie hath sent a strong Decretum to the Earle Iohn Sigismund of Altensheym / that within the end of this moneth of December he should set af all the Lutherian Officers / and substitute Catholike in stead of them. The like should be done in the Salt-ministery / and the Book-keēping. After the Holy dayes the Frenche Ambassa∣dour is minded to take his journey to Bethlem Gabor / to make with the same an agreement / but his Maiestie should have answered / that he would neyther consent to it / nor keepe it bak∣ward / but hee might do his pleasure / his Maie∣stie had meanes to compel the Hungarians to obedience. From vienna the 30 hereof. The enterprise wee had againe upon Presburg is unluckily proceeded / and with the losse of som hundred of ours fallen out / for the intelligence wee had with the Captaine was discovered be / fore our coming / and the Captaine is put in prison.
From Lints in Austria, the 30 hereof. Heere is advised / that the departed King of Bohemia should marche againe to Bohemia and Saxonie / with a great number of Hungarians and other Nations / with some Turks and Tar∣tarians. The Moravians marche strongly against the Emperours Folkes / and notwithstanding that the same have taken Zuaim / they hope to recover it / because the Kinge with the Hungarians are making them strong. The newes continueth / that the Emperours Folke by Tuglau are slaine of the Moravians. The Duke of Bavaria hath sent already heere a Politicq Ordinance / which perhaps in this Countreys shall speedly be published / and the matter is in such state that the Countrey of the Ens for many yeares shall be conscribed / which shall cause a great altration / and as they saye the States and Communes desire of the Empe∣rour to receave the Inauguration / and resolu∣tion should be followed / that the said four States should consent the petition / that the Duke of Bavaria had requested in ready money. And that the Auguration then could be furthered / and because that same amounts to a great somme of money / concerning the pretension of the Duke / and that it is impossible that the States should furnish so much / therefore against our will we shall be constrained to remaine Bavarish / which is not liked of many Lords. From Prage, the 29 hereof. Som few dayes past the Folke of the Empe∣rour have been at Tabor / purposing to take it in with an assault / but are driven of with the losse of 500. men. And therefore hath Monsieur Tilly written for more assistannce of men. The Smarackes or commun people heere spe∣cially in the new Cittie / have been som few dayes past very seditious / because the Garrison did not cease of saccaging / and they have slaine above 100. and did beginne themselves to saccadge / so that the Generals and others had enough to do to pacifye them. From Presburgh the 28. hereof. Vpon this Land-daye is concluded / in the presence of the Ambassadours of Denmarke / Sweden and Hungaria / and the confederated Princes / to keep in the fields for the King 16000 men / and to constitute a new general / and to live and dye in this Confederation / whereupon the King should be in his journey to Brin with 16000 men / and the Earle of Thurne should be∣have him very wel in Morabia / and not be arre∣sted as the speech went. From Heydelbergh, the 5 of Ianuarij, 1621. The Earle of Thurne was returned with new ayde from Hungaria into Moravia with declaration and resolution that Bethlem Gabor King of Hungaria / notwithstanding the great losse / would assiste his Maiestie of Bohemia with all his power / and never forsake the Con∣federation. Yea the Hungarians saye openly / that before they should submitte themselves to the House of Austria / they would rather take helpe of the Turke. The Emperour should have manifestly decla∣red / that he hath given commission to the Mar∣quis Spinola / to make himselfe Maister of the whole Palts. Both by the Emperour and Vnited Princes is great need of money / Spinola having occu∣pied and taken the principal Customes / requi∣ring upon penalty of burning so great chardges of money / that the meorporated Lands are not able to bring them up. The Coronell Gray is finally with his men arrived in the Over Palts / where he shall re∣mayne unto neerer commaundement. From Coppenhaghen is written / that there was arrived the Sonne of Duke Hans from Sonderberch / Kinsman or Couzen Germaine of his Maiestie of Dennemarke / as Ambassa∣dour of his Maiestie of Bohemia / is lodged upon the Castle / and should further take his Iourney to his Maieestie of Dennemarke at Frederich∣bergh / his commission and petition is un∣knowne. The Nuptial Feast of his Maiestie of Swe∣den / and the Koronation of the Queen is ended with good succes / it seemes that his Maiestie of Sweden is resolved to ondertake some thing against the Poole / and hath already at Stock∣holme 15000 Footmen in readines. Letters from Paris declare / that the Mari∣schal Cadinet with a great suite is departed to his Maiestie of great Brittayne. The Religious matters in Fraunce are yet of a strange showe / they hope neverthelesse that his Maiestie will direct all to the best / giving con∣tentement to them of the Religion. The Lord of Bossampiere doth not depart to Spaine from the Kings part / to restitution of the Deltolines / before the Helvetians Cantons amongst them / and they with the Grisons shall be agreed and united. Imprinted at Amsterdam by George Veseler, Ao. 1621. The 21 of Ianuari. And are to be soulde by Petrus Keerius, dvvelling in the Calverstreete, in the uncertaine time.
