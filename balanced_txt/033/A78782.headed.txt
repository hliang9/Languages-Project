C R DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms HIS MAIESTIES FAREVVEL SPEECH Vnto the Lords Commissioners at Newport in the Isle of Wight. MY LORDS, You are come to take your leave of me, and I beleeve we shall scarce ever see each other againe: but Gods will be done, I thanke God, I have made my peace with him, and shall without feare, undergoe what he shall be pleased to suffer men to doe unto me. My Lords, you cannot but know, that in my fall and ruine, you see your owne, and that also neere to you; I pray God send you bet∣ter friends then I have found. I am fully informed of the whole cariage of the plot against me and mine; and nothing so much afflicts me, as the sence and feeling I have of the sufferings of my Subjects, and the miseries that hang over my three Kingdomes, drawne upon them by those who (upon preten∣ces of good) violently pursue their owne interests and ends. These words His Majesty delivered with much alacrity, and cheer∣fulnesse, with a serene Countenance, and a cariage free from all di∣sturbance. Thus parting with the Lords, leaving many tender Impressions, (if not in them) in the other hearers.
