I Do Appoint ROBERT BOUL∣TER and BENJAMIN ALSOP to Print this my Narrative, Entituled, The Present State and Condition of IRELAND, &c. January 17. 1680. Edmund Murphy.
THE Present State AND CONDITION OF IRELAND, But more especially the PROVINCE OF ULSTER, Humbly represented to the KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. BY EDMUND MURPHY, Secular Priest, and Titular Chanter of ARMACH, and one of the First Discoverers of the IRISH PLOT. LONDON, Printed for R. Boulter at the Turks Head in Cornhil, and Benj. Alsop at the Angel and Bible in the Poultrey. 1681.
THE Present State AND CONDITION OF IRELAND, &c. THe First occasion of Discovering the Plot carried on by Dr. Oliver Plunckett, and other Treasons, was a difference that arose between Mr. John Dermond of Castletown-Bedlow in the County of Louth, and one Ensign John Smith, as the Reader will understand in the per∣usal of the following Relation. I. The Informant being Parish Priest of Killevey and Chantor of Armach, at which time the inhabitants of the said Pa∣rish suffered great dammage and losses by the Tyranny of
one Redmond Hanlon and his Confederates; the said Han∣lon being a cruel Murderer, Rebel and Tory, (which is appa∣rent to the whole Kingdome of Ireland) against whom the In∣formant preached in open Assembly, and not only against his Associates, but also against all such as relieved and harbour∣ed the said Redmond; which he the said Redmond hearing, sent many Threats to the Informant, willing him to desist his reflections against him and his Companions, or otherwise the effect of the said Informants preaching should prove bitter to him elf in the latter end: for they protested to make him tread the same steps with sorrow back again to other Kingdomes, whence he came, upon default of not taking the Advice afore∣said. II. The said Hanlon perceiving the Threatning sent to the In∣formant could not answer the end thereof, made an Edict throughout that Barony, (therein declaring) that whoever came to hear the said Informant, should for the first time pay one Cow, and for the second Misdememeanor of that kind should pay two Cows, and for the third his life; which ac∣cordingly he executed; having taken one Cow from John M. Fulloney, proceeded to take the second; and in pursuance of one of the Informants Parishioners (out of his own house) by name Cully Mackavell, barbarously murthered him; by which the Informant saw into what danger he had brought himself and others by his Preaching, therefore hired a Curate to offi∣ciate in his said Parish, and himself seldom or ever after re∣sorted thither. III. It followed that one Cormacke Raver O-Murphy, Herds∣man to one Lieutenant Henry Baker, committed several Rob∣beries against several persons of the County of Louth and Ar∣mach, being encouraged thereunto from the consideration he had of his Masters being an Officer of his Majesties stand∣ing Army, and concluding it safeguard enough to colour his Roguery, which so emboldened him to that height of inso∣lency, that his Master could not be supposed able to answer to the one third of his Villany, upon which he was necessi∣tated to desert the service of his said Master: which done, he joyned himself to the Tories (viz.) the said Hanlon and his company: leaving William Murphy his Brother as a pledge to
serve his said Master, Lieutenant Baker: his Unkle Bryan Murphy then serving Ensign John Smith, the said Baker's Fa∣ther-in-law. IV. The said Cormucke by his notorious actions rendered all of his name obnoxious though never so honest: so that it was concluded upon by such to joyn issue together to bring him back dead or alive; and the first opportunity they found for that pur∣pose was about September 1678; the Informant being at a meet∣ing in his said Parish on Sunday; and after service demanded of one Thomas Murphy who had been absent, what kept him so long; the said Thomas in his Reply, called aside the In∣formant with others of the chief of the said Parish, and in∣formed them that the said Cormucke with seven more, were drinking in a certain place called Carick Stickin, about a mile distant from the residence of the said Baker and Smith; wherefore the Informant called others of his Parish (that were graver than the rest) to consult what was best to be done in this matter, to which some of them replyed, that they durst not give notice to the Kings Officers, lest they might be disappointed; adding further, that when ever the said Rebels had intelligence of the Informers, they would come and burn their Houses soon after; but the Informant apprehending the slavish fear they were possessed with, re∣paired immediately to the said Lieutenant Baker's house, without any further Conference, sending a Letter by one Art O Quine, unto the said Lieutenant Baker, to meet the Informant in an Acre of ground near the said Baker's house; where he accordingly came, accompanied with his Wife; where the Deponent declared his business, acquainting the said Ba∣ker, that hard by his house were a company of Tories drink∣ing, shewing him how the poor Countrey sustained much dammage by them, and that now there was an opportuni∣ty to take so many of them, if he would employ his Soul∣diers thereabout. The said Lieutenant replyed, that if the De∣ponent would be bound that the Tories would abide his co∣ming, he would send for his Souldiers; to which the Depo∣nent answered, he could not dive into their thoughts, but if the said Baker was loth to execute his Office, he would go himself, if he might be fitted with Arms, and help ac∣cordingly, and take them. But the said Baker made this an∣swer, that they did to the neighbourhood no dammage, and that Cormacke Raver O-Murphy was there, who he was satis∣fied the Informant would not consent to have slain among the rest, seeing the Deponent and he were both of a name; but
the Informant protested the contrary: upon which the said Baker made him some slight promises to have them secured; and in hopes of the performance of what he had promised, the Informant departed, informing his Friends what had pas∣sed between him and the said Baker; (all which proved of no effect) Notwithstanding the Informant can deposite upon Oath that the said Rebels remained in the same Town all night drinking, at the house of one Richard Baths, and in the morn∣ing were so drunk that their Wenches were forced to help them away, so that if five or six Countrey-men had attempted to take them with the use of their Clubs, they might have easily ac∣complished the enterprize, notwithstanding their Fire-Arms and Weapons. V. That after the said Lieutenant Baker received intelligence that a certain Tory, by name Art Mackardle, was in one Ed∣mund O Quin's house, the said O-Quin being Tenant to the Informants Father; and the said Baker and some of his Soul∣diers lying in ambush till morning about the said house; from whence then came forth the said Tory, whom the Souldiers pursued from the Mountain to the Plain, where the said Tory made his escape; at which the Souldiers seemed much con∣cerned and angry: in which rage they took Prisoners both men and women that they met with, under pretence of en∣couraging the said Tory in his flight, and that he had given his Arms (as he escaped) to some women; among the rest the Informants nurse was taken, and brought Prisoner to the Town of Dundalk: the day following being Sunday, a certain Boy came and informed the Deponent, that his Nurse was taken by Lieutenant Baker and his Souldiers, under the pre∣tence aforesaid; the said Boy affirming further, that he the said Mackardle with two more of his Companions, were drink∣ing at one Richard Bath's house, not far distant from the said Ensign John Smith's house, where the said Baker had been himself an hour before. The Informant sending the said B y to see whether the said Tories tarried still in the said place, the Boy returned with the Affirmative, and how they had taken some Gentlemen as they passed by; at which answer the Informant hasted (in some fury) to the said Baker; en∣quiring what knavery was carried on between his Souldiers and Tories, and why the Informants Nurse should be detain∣ed Prisoner about the escape of Mackardle? seeing he was all day drinking near the said Baker's house: After which the said Baker promised her liberty, which he accordingly per∣formed.
VI. That the Deponent having a Brother, by name Phele∣my Murphy, who travelling to Dundalk, passed by near to the said Ensign John Smith's house, in a certain hollow place where Sand and Gravel was before digged up, and who did he there meet but the said Baker, and the foresaid Cormucke Raver O-Murphy, a Rebel and proclaimed Tory, with others drinking hot waters and other Liquors; the said Phelemy was somewhat astonied at first sight hereof, but the less daunted at the sight of the said Baker; who commanded the said Phelemy to light off his horse, and take the Bible Oath not to reveal the meeting of the said Tory and himself, (who were exercising themselves in wrestling) who pressed so much drink on the said Phelemy, that he was altogether uncapable to go about his bu∣siness any further, (nor return home) therefore stayed all night in the Field: in the mean time his horse went home without him, where his friends immediately concluded he was ei∣ther slain or drown'd. And at this time William Murphy was Herdsman to the said Baker, in the room of his bro∣ther the said Cormucke, who was turned Rebel and Tory: though 'tis the Informants opinion, that had they all three been shaken together in a Bag, it would puzzle the understanding of a wise man to pass an impartial judgement who was most Re∣bel and Tory of all the three; whether Cormucke, or his said Bro∣ther William, or the Lieutenant himself: for the said William Murphy, who was the said Baker's Herdsman (as before men∣tioned) told the Deponent and several others, that he was as a faithful Messenger employed by the said Lieutenant Baker, to carry Powder and Ammunition from his Master, for the sup∣ply of the Tories. VII. That the Deponent was credibly informed by Katherine Mi∣cardle and several others, that the said Baker was God-father to the Child of Bryan Micardle, a proclaimed Tory: and the Informant had all other circumstances relating to the said Christening told him.
VIII. That Richard Bath who lived the same year in the In∣formants Parish (did and) can testifie that what was reveal∣ed to the said Baker in secret, in order to apprehend the Tories that frequented the said Bath's house; that it was no sooner revealed, but the Tories were made acquainted therewith, repeating Verbatim what was delivered as matter of Secresie to the said Lieutenant Baker, relating to the appre∣hending the said Tories; which being understood by them, and that the said Bath went about to betray them; the said Cormucke coming to his house, designed to kill him, but the Piece missing Fire, he made his escape: it was agreed on by the Tories to have him hanged at his own door; but giving him the liberty of taking the Oath, he solemnly swore on the Bible never to attempt the betraying them any more, by which means he was then spared. This was declared to the Informant and Mr. William Hethrington, by the whole fami∣ly of the said Bath, which afterwards was related to the Duke of Ormond by the Informant: With many more of the like transactions in the Countrey. IX. That the said Cormucke Raver O-Murphy growing very no∣torious, at length he forsook the great Rebel Redmond Han∣lon; and by reason of his dexterity in plundering and pil∣laging, he became the Ring-leader of a company distinct to himself; and at a certain time came accompanied with two of his men, to the Informants Parish (viz.) Killevey, and plun∣dered three Scotch-men there resident, (the names of which were given to the Duke of Ormond by the Informant,) these three men being before Tributaries to the said Redmond Han∣lon, it being become a custome for the Countrey people of Ire∣land to pay a certain sum of money to the Tories for a Pass to go unmolested (about their necessary affairs) from the rest of the Gang: the said three men complaining to the said Redmond how they had been spoiled by the said Cormucke and his com∣pany, notwithstanding their paying for Pass and Protection from such invasion; the said Hanlon desired them to have patience, and to colour the matter till such time as he could take the said Cormucke. Whereupon the said Hanlon repaired towards the place where he knew the said Cormucke was, and sent to desire his company to go along with the said Hanlon (as he pretended) to take a booty; which the said Cormucke, not in the least doubting, came accordingly to meet Hanlon,
having no more in company but two of his men, that had been at the taking of the fore-mentioned booty: but he no sooner appeared before the said Hanlon, but he was taken; which the two men perceiving their Captain in custody, betook them to their heels, and one of them had made his escape, had not one Laghbin Hanlon, brother to the said Redmond, taken a horse from the Plow and pursued him, so that he was also taken: and all three (viz.) the said Cormucke and two men were guarded by fourteen Tories through the Informants Parish to one Neale Brolly's house, where the said Hanlon sent for the persons that were robbed, and delivered them the said Murphy, setting his two men at liberty, upon condition they would re∣store the goods aforesaid, and withal writ a Mittimus to the next Justice of the Peace, with the said Cormucke Murphy; who seeing himself liable to the censure of the Law, contracted with the said Hanlon's brother (before-mentioned) to give him 20 l. the week following to have his liberty, which he had ac∣cordingly; but without any Arms or Weapons: This being done in the face of the Informants Parish. The said Cormucke being set at liberty, provided himself new Arms; sends a Chal∣lenge to the said Redmond: who refused to appear, but made solemn protestations to be revenged of the said Cormucke in pub∣lick or private. X. The Informant receiving intelligence that one of his Horses were stolen, obtains a warrant from Sir Hans Hamilton for the apprehending such person or persons in whose custody the said Horse should be found; which he effected accordingly: and brought the persons before one Sir Toby Points, one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace; where the Informant met one Captain William Butler, who enquired of the Informant if he had seen the great Rebel Hanlon lately. to which the Infor∣mant replyed, he might easily be seen in the Informants Pa∣rish, if there were any to look after him: Upon which the said Captain called the Informant aside, asking him if he could assist him with his advice how the said Rebel Hanlon might be ap∣prehended or kill'd: to which the Deponent answered, how dan∣gerous it was to trust the military men of that Kingdome; and withal related to the said Captain how Lieutenant Baker had served him in that matter; adding, that if any diligent and faithful Souldiers had taken the cause in hand, the said Hanlon had not tyrannized over poor people for two years last past: to which the said Captain answered, if that service was but once accomplished, the said Baker should be disbanded: the said Captain desiring the Informants advice herein, they made a solemn Covenant among themselves to be true to each other
in the management of this affair: the Informant telling the said Captain, that Cormucke Raver O-Murphy who had lately fallen out with the said Hanlon, and being by him taken, he would prove the only man instrumental in this business: and withal, the In∣formant told the Captain he would by one means or other in∣cite the said Cormucke to this service, if the said Captain thought no danger would ensue thereon: hereupon the Cap∣tain approved highly of the design, and desired the Informant to promise the said Cormucke twenty Guineas and his Par∣don; and that he might have free regress to the said Cap∣tain, seeing he was hitherto no Murtherer, though a Rob∣ber and Rebel: all which the Captain desired to be done in his name. XI. That the Informant made diligent search and enquiry after the said Cormucke several days, and when he had found him, he privately declared to him what service he was to do, with Captain Butler's propositions for the performance of the same: withal the Informant told him, he would give him five pounds of his own over and above. XII. That the Informant having delivered the message, the said Cormucke made the following Objections, (viz.) that there was great difficulty that attended the accomplishment of the said design, by reason of the mutual correspondency that was held between him and several of the Officers of the Kings Army, as also his intimacy with many of the Romish Clergy, though he the said Cormucke confessed he knew no Company less con∣cerned than the said Captain Butler's, by reason they were newly come to the Countrey, though five therein held corre∣spondency with the said Hanlon; who by his Letters received daily encouragement that in a short time he should see war: and it was that expectation which obstructed his departing the Kingdome before that time; nevertheless he the said Cormucke would work a device to have him destroyed or taken, with the assistance of Captain Butler aforesaid. XIII. That the device should be carried on thus: that the said Cap∣tain should send Cormucke a private protection, and twelve
Souldiers, habited like the Tories; and this to be done in the night time; and that he would place ten of the said twelve in Ambushment near the place where Redmond's goods were suspe∣cted to be, by him the said Cormucke; and that himself would go with the other two, to a place where they might be dis∣covered by the said Redmond and his company, as such as came to plunder; which when by them observed, they would make a retreat to bring the said Redmond and company to the men in Ambush, who might presently issue forth and take Red∣mond: this the said Cormucke concluded to be the best course; to which the Informant gave his approbation. XIV. That the Informant might not be suspected by the said Red∣mond's friends living in his Parish, he concluded to go on foot to the said Captain Butler's house, which was sixteen miles distant from the Informants habitation, it being also very tem∣pestuous weather, he notwithstanding repaired thither; and not finding the Captain at home, determined to send the re∣sult of his message to Cormucke, and Cormucke's answer, in a Letter by the hand of one of his Souldiers to the said Captain Butler; by reason the Informant understood he was not to return in four days: and obtaining leave from his Lady for one of the Souldiers to go, he sent the Letter accordingly. XV. That the Informant suddenly after this, met the said Cormucke, who demanded where his private Protection was, to which the Informant made answer, that he had not seen the Captain since, but that he had sent him a relation of their Conference by one of his own Souldiers in a Letter; but the said Cormucke replied, he would neither trust the Deponent nor the said Cap∣tain: for he further said, that if the Souldiers came to execute the said design against Hanlon, he would not stir without a Protection; for thereby himself was liable to be taken, especi∣ally if what he intended could not be effected against the said Redmond: upon the hearing of this matter, the Informant sends a Messenger with a Letter to the said Captain, therein ac∣quainting him with the said Cormucke's readiness to the ser∣vice aforesaid: as also how he doubted the Informant's and said Captains fidelity, seeing no Protection was provided for him: wherefore the said Captain returned answer to the Deponent, that he had enclosed him a Letter in the Duke of Ormond's, from whom he expected a Protection should be had the Tues∣day
following; desiring also the Informant to give the said Cormucke all the encouragement possible; assuring by Oath in his Letter, he would not for a Million of money any Trick should be put on the said Cormucke; but on the contrary, he should have all reasonable security for the performance of what was promised; which Letter the Informant sent to the said Cormucke for his assurance of a Pardon and Protection, and bet∣ter encouragement to prosecute his design. XVI. That the first opportunity the said Cormucke took to expedite his intent was the surprizal of one David Molligan of the Town of Lecorry, in the County of Armach; who coming from Dub∣lin, was commanded to stand (by the said Cormucke) and de∣liver his Purse; instead of which the said David produced his Pass under the great Rebel Hanlon's hand, telling him, that his Father and Hanlon were Gossips, and that the said Hanlon had often been sheltered in his Fathers house when narrow search was made by virtue of Sir Hans Hamilton's Warrant for him: hereby the said Cormucks had the opportunity to exasperate the said Hanlon, seeing his name and authority were made use of, for the said Cormucke on set purpose resolved to contemn the same acquainting further the said David, notwithstanding his great esteem of Hanlon, that he would not save the least scrip of his goods for his sake, till such time the said Hanlon did restore the said Cormuck's Arms, which he had a little before deceitfully taken from him: hereupon the said David promised he should have them, provided he would restore his goods at the reception thereof, at a certain place appointed; which both parties agreed to. XVII. That the said Cormucke found out the Informant that night, and told him how opportunely, he had met with the great Re∣bel Hanlon's Friend, and of the other circumstances relating to the said meeting by them appointed: but the Informant coun∣selled the said Cormucke not to send for the Souldiers assigned for that purpose, till he might be assured of Hanlon himself being at the place.
XVIII. That on the appointed day the said David came to the place agreed on, placing the said Hanlon and his Associates near thereunto; but providently one John Mackeevir going by, was by the said Hanlon and his company espied out of the Ambush, who immediately surprized him, and thought to have killed him, concluding it was the said Cormucke;This being in the night time. but he cry∣ed out aloud for mercy, and the Rebels understanding by the voice that they were mistaken, released him; by this outcry the said Cormucke was alarmed that the said Hanlon and his company lay wait for him, therefore he absented himself for that time: the said Hanlon thus missing his expectation, sends the said David Molligan and his Father-in-law to Patrick Mur∣phy's house, brother to the said Cormucke; who lived about half a mile from the said appointed place of meeting. The said David and his Father-in-law Gibson, made diligent search for the said Cormucke there, where he was not found; there∣fore they returned with an answer to the said Hanlon: who in great rage went to the house of the said Patricke, and openly before all the Town caused him to be brought from the Plough, before the said Hanlon, to be examined whether it was with his consent the Traytor his Brother had robbed his Friend the said David; to which the said Patrick Murphy answered the Negative, declaring that he knew nothing of his Robberies: but notwithstanding Hanlon proceeded to judgement, which was, that Patrick's goods (if that might suffice) should be responsi∣ble for the robbery (taken by his Brother from the said David) if not, his life: to which the said Patrick replied, that he ho∣ped his friends should not be responsible for all his villanies, if so, they had enough to do; which the said Hanlon not able to bear, gave the said Patrick; blow, and with an Oath affirmed, he should dearly pay for the said goods if they were not suddenly restored. XIX. That several messages passed between the said Hanlon and Cormucke; and at length determined among themselves, that the said Cormucke should restore his goods to the said David, and that the said Hanlon would restore him his Arms; for which a time and place was appointed: which was no sooner done, but the said Cormucke acquaints the Informant of the whole; desiring him to inform Captain Butler therewith, and that the Souldiers might he placed in a readiness near the pre∣fixed
place, and the time aforesaid: withal, that the Informant should provide some Brandy and Hot Waters, which might be placed near the said place, that Redmond and his Associates might be decoy'd therewith: which the Informant at his own charge bought and disposed of accordingly. XX. That Fortune seemed to frown at this Enterprize; for it was established by an Act, that the Tories relations should make good what was taken from any; therefore the said David Molligan got a party of Souldiers, who apprehended the said Patrick Murphy, brother to the said Cormucke; who told the Souldiers how the said David and his Father-in-law came with the said Redmond, threatning to kill him for the said goods; that therefore he had employed his Wife to learn where the said Cormucke had disposed of the fore-menti∣oned goods, which after she found hid in a mountain; and at her return found her Husband apprehended by Souldiers; which Souldiers she guided to the place where the goods were: upon which her husband was set at liberty: and the said Redmond hearing thereof, was very much pleased thereat; and sent word to the said Cormucke, that he would neither meet him at the place appointed, nor restore him his Arms; which the said Cor∣mucke understanding, was very much enraged with his said Bro∣thers Wife. All which was declared to the said Deponent from Cormucke, and the said Patrick his Brother. XXI. That after this the said Cormucke took the first opportunity he found to bring about his intention, and that was by rob∣bing a certain Cousin of the said Hanlon's, who had a Protecti∣on from him, and his name was Raverty; who one evening going from Dublin, told some Travellers, that were of his com∣pany, that if they thought good he would preserve them from any robbery if they would deliver their charge to him; for he told them he was a kinsman of some of the chief Rebels in the Kingdome, to which they consented: but Cormucke no sooner met them, but he made it a good argument to rob the said Raverty, when he heard him mention the said Hanlon; which done, he immediately repairs to the Informant, to desire him to acquaint Captain Butler, that he had done something to pro∣voke the great Rebel, and that he knew he and his company would presently be at his heels, and therefore desired the Soul∣diers
might be ready: which the Deponent hearing, went to Tondegree to see for the said Captain, and there heard that the said Captain was departed thence two days before, by the Duke of Ormond's Order, with his Company, a jour∣ney of fifty miles distant: to which the Deponent knew not what to say. XXII. That at this juncture of time was great stir in the Infor∣mants Parish and other places near adjacent, narrow search be∣ing there made by the said Hanlon and his Confederates, for the said Cormucke: upon this account several were apprehend∣ed by Hanlon, as being in Confederacy with Cormucke; among the rest was taken one Bryan O-Hagby and John Hamilton, for revealing that some of the Kings Souldiers were lookers on when the Tories apprehended them; and did never attempt to impede those things acted by the Tories so openly, in the sight of all resident in those parts; who dared not to make the least opposition, being as much afraid of the Souldiers as Tories. XXIII. That within two nights following the Informant arrived at home from Tondegree, at whose return the said Cormucke came to him, and enquired for the Souldiers he was to have for the effecting his design; telling the Informant he was well satisfied where the said Redmond lay: adding how he and his Confede∣rates had been in the pursuit of him the said Cormucke, since the Informant had been absent: to all which the said Informant re∣plied, that the said Captain was departed with his Company to remote parts of the Countrey: at which the said Cormucke grew very angry with the said Captain and Informant, for making him obnoxious both to Tories and Souldiers; and that by their means each party was become his professed enemies: but the In∣formant perswaded him to have a little patience, for there was a Captain and his Company newly arrived from England, to whom the Informant would make his application for assistance, to the end the fore-mentioned design might be accomplished: for the Deponent told the said Cormucke, that there could be no pro∣bability of any correspondency and friendship between the said Company and Tories, by reason of their late arrival in the Countrey.
XXIV. That the next night the Informant repaired to Dundalk to speak with the said Captain, where he found him accompanied with several, who continued most part of the night drinking Wine and other Liquors; so that the Informant despaired of a convenient opportunity to deliver his business, therefore com∣municated the matter to one of the Souldiers, whom he willed to acquaint his Captain the next morning therewith, and not to divulge the same to any, which he promised to do; and for his encouragement the Informant gave him a piece of money; but the said Souldier forgot his promise, and declared the business to one of his drunken companions, who willed the Informant to get up early in the morning, and to accompany him to his Cap∣tains Chamber, who he was sure would be glad of the news; further he confirmed the matter, by making Proclamation in the audience of all the Company that was near, that he would not depart with the Deponent, till the said Rebel Hanlon was betrayed, and himself performed what he had promised. XXV. That the Informant went to the said Captain (by name Coult) and made him sensible of all, and how Captain Butler was de∣parted when the business was brought near a period; also com∣plaining of one of the Souldiers, whom he had employed to in∣form his Captain, and instead thereof, had foolishly published the same; for which the said Captain blamed the Informant for trusting any but himself: but withal, desired him to use his en∣deavour, and he should have assistance. XXVI. That through the rumour that spread through the said Soul∣diers report, all or most people were possess'd, that the Infor∣mant received a large summ of money from the said Captain Coult, to bring in the heads of several of the chief Tories and Rebels, among others one Neale, and the said Cormucke, both Tories; all which was spread abroad by the means of lying fame. All the said Tories verily believed the report except Cor∣mucke, who well knew the Informants design; but the rest made solemn vows to kill the Informant in the first place they met him; the Informant getting intelligence hereof, betook himself to a habitation at Dundalk, where he continued a certain sea∣son;
but one day going thence to visit his Parish, accompani∣ed with on y one Fryer Duffee, as they passed by the Hill of Carristickin they were espied by the foresaid Tories, among whom was the said Cormucke; and coming violently all together upon the Informant, he was thereat surprized; but Cormucke immediate∣ly interposed between the Informant and them, making oath that whosoever should lay hands on the said Informant should in the like manner perish; and Cormucke demanding what might be his crime, they told him he was a Rogue, and had contracted with Cap∣tain Coult for a summ of money to bring in their Heads, but the Informant protested the contrary; and that he never men∣tioned their names to the said Captain; (which indeed was true, for his only aim was to surprize Hanlon) whereupon they were satisfied: and the Deponent admitted to resort to his Parish. XXVII. That the said Redmond departed at this rumour to the Pro∣vince of Conaught, where he exercised his Diabolical Function for a time: so that the Informant sent word to the said Captain Coult that he was departed Ulster, and that nothing could be executed against him. XXVIII. That within two months following Captain Butler and his Company returned, and Captain Coult departed from Dundalk; upon which the Informant gave notice to the said Cormucke, telling him that now Captain Butler was returned; and that if he did not perform what he had promised touching Hanlon, the Informant should prove his greatest enemy: unto which the said Cormucke promised to be very diligent therein at the said Red∣mond's return, but that at present he was absent our of the Countrey. XXIX. That the said Cormucke, the better to bring his business to perfection, committed the secret to one Neale, who he ex∣pected would be partaker with him in the said service; the which the said Neale faithfully promised to do, and in order thereunto went to the said Redmond, to learn what time he would return, where Cormucke expected him. But the said Neale remaining six days with the said Hanlon, in that time he discovered to him the design of Cormucke,
which Hanlon hearing, bound Neale by Oath not to let Cormucke know that he had shewed him the matter, but dissemble the same; and that in the interim he would send one of his men to wait an opportunity to kill the said Cormucke; and withal, that he would give Neale ten pounds; with which resolution the said Neale and one Mackardle departed to Cormucke, to whom they coloured the business with much deceit, vilifying the said Redmond very much, and saying that he divided the spoil un∣equally among his men, and for their own parts they did not approve of such shuffling; and that they intended to desert him, and keep company with their equals, and not to be insulted over any longer by him: all this they said to delude the said Cormucke, and to ingratiate themselves into his favour; adding, that it was an easie matter to surprize Redmond, for (said Neale) himself and his Wife lye most nights without a guard. XXX. That the said Cormucke willing to hasten his enterprize, willed the said Neale to accompany him to the house of Ensign John Smith, there to get some powder, the better to furnish himself, as he was accustomed to do; saying he had some busi∣ness with Mr. John Dermond: whither they came, it being half a mile distant from the said Ensign John Smith's house; where they had not been long drinking, but the said Neale, to be∣gin a quarrel, fell to abuse the said Dermond in his own house, for which the said Cormucke reproved him; at length came thither Cormucke's two brothers, the one servant to Lieutenant Baker, the other servant to Ensign John Smith; they came to the said Cormucke to re-mind him of his Father that was ta∣ken a little before, and that the said Cormucke should intercede with the said Ensign John Smith for his releasement, and that the said Ensign would write with one of them thereabout; both which Brothers of Cormucke accompanied him out of the house, the rather because he reproved the said Neale for his abuse to the said Dermond, and lest a difference should arise therefore, hard words having already passed; the said Cormucke having before over-charged one of his Pistols, left it with the said Neale before they parted the house, and went to Ensign John Smith's house; the two Brethren of Cormucke going some di∣stance before: when the said Neale came to the Ensigns house, he knocked at the door somewhat too hard, for which Cormucke was somewhat angry with Neale; which he perceiving took the said Pistol, with which he shot Cormucke; asking him whether he had the same design against him as he had against Hanlon.
with that Cormuck fell off his Horse mortally wounded,It may be supposed the said Neal made haste to Redmond for his reward, for now he had merited Twenty in∣stead of Ten pounds; but consider it was the price of Blood. and the said Neal put spurs to his, and fled, with only the Stock in his hand, the Pistol breaking by reason of the Charge; at the cry of the said Cormuck, his brethren hasted back, and the Ensign also waked, it being the night-time, and came to see the said Cormuck who lay wallowing in his Blood, and his Brethren with others carried him near to another Brothers House, half a mile distant; in the mean time a Servant of Lieutenant Bakers came posting in all hast to the Informants House, pretending to the Informant, that his Wife lay at the point of death and that he feared she would not live his coming, except he hasted; the Informant made not the least delay, but got up, and immediately followed the Messenger, till he had brought him where the said Cormuck was, in a deplorable condition, but his Life not quite expired; many of his Kindred and acquaintance being present, the Depo∣nent examined him of the matter, and in his reply, he said, that Neale had betrayed him; withall part of the Stock of the said Pistol was there produced which had wounded him, and that near Ensign John Smith's House; but the Informant enquired of him, whether any belonging to the said Ensign had a hand therein? but he answered in the Negative. Sud∣denly after this, there was sent a Messenger from Ensign John Smith to see the said Cormuck, and to know if he want∣ed any thing; but at that time was nothing more wanting, than something to prolong Life, which could not be procu∣red, and therefore in a short time he gave up the Ghost. The Deponent having departed, there came a Brother of the said Cormuck, accompanied with Lieutenant Baker to see him, but ere they came he was dead; after the said Baker's depar∣ture, the Informant came to the place where the said Cor∣muck's Body was, and there found one Patrick Kernan, for∣merly a Servant to the said Baker, who was wont to sell the Tories stolen Horses in remote parts of the Countrey, now was there imployed to make a Bier for the Corps of the said Cormuck; this Patrick was married to the Sister-in-law of the said Neal that had killed Cormuck: now the Brethren of the said Cormuck consulted with the Informant what to do with the Corps, and he advised them to have it carried by the assistance of some, to a place appointed for his buryal, and that one of the Brothers, viz. Hugh Murphy should go to the said Neal and his confederates, feignedly to inform, that the death of Cormuck was not imputed to Neal, but that it appeared to be accidental, to the end the said Neal might
come to the Burying, and thereby be surprized by the Bre∣thren of Cormuck; and that if Neal complied with him, the Informant to have notice thereof, and that he would seem∣ingly come to the place accidentally, to the end he might be instrumentally servicable to detain the said Tories by ac∣companying them to drink, till such time as the Guard might be sent for to Dundalk in that Interim, &c. XXXI. That when this Stratagem was laid, it was concluded that the said Cormuck should not be removed until the said Hugh, Brother of Cormuck, should find Neal, which he at length did, and by many protestations and feigned words, prevail'd with him to come to Cormuck's Burial, of which, the Infor∣mant had notice to meet them near the Church; and to avoid suspition, he took his Horse and carried his Sister behind him, and tarried a while in the said place ere the Burying came, at last he saw the Company that attended the Corps coming, and amongst the rest the said Neal, and another Tory, by name Macklevy, which the Brethren of the deceased invited to the Ale-house after the Burial was over, which the said Neal and company embraced, the Deponent going before to the next publick House, and giving order if any came to enquire for him, that they should not want what Liquor they desired and he would pay all; having giving this order, the Informant went into the company of some Gentlemen then in the House; the Brethren of the said Cormuck draw∣ing near the House with the said Neal, it was observed by Neal and his Company that there were Strangers drinking, so refused to go in, but drank in the Backside; but one Ker∣nan aforementioned (who made the Bier for Cormuck's Corps) desired the said Neal to depart, being his Kinsman and Gossip, for that he suspected the said Cormuck's Brethren hatch'd some mischief against him; by which means he be∣came cautious of himself, and told the Company he would stay no longer, some of which inform'd the Deponent thereof, therefore he went himself to perswade them to stay, which they refused, alledging it dangerous for them to be so publick, and therewith departed; the which the Informant observing, gave the said Hugh a piece of Money to have them to another place more remote, and there detain them with Drink, till the Deponent might find out some means to surprize them, which he would be as speedy in as he could;
but Hugh, nor the rest, could not prevail to make them stay at any place, by reason of the said Kernan who kept them company, giving them still caution to be careful of them∣selves. As the said Hugh, and the rest of Cormuck's Brethren departed with Neal and his Company, Neal kissed a Sister of theirs; but when he was gone a good distance, one of the Brothers was so angry, that he struck her for having such fa∣miliarity with her Brothers murderer; at which she cried out, and Neal hearing, return'd back, and would have killed the said Brother, had not a Kinsman of Cormuck stept in between and thrown Neal down, and had certainly kill'd him, had not Kernan prevented, by taking him by the Hair of the Head from off the said Torey; being in this confusion, there was great noise, which the Informant hearing, did hastily, ride to understand the matter, and seeing the bustle that the said Cormuck's Brethren made in so inconvenient a place, was vex∣ed they should discover themselves and intentions to the said Tories, being there was no probability of effecting their en∣terprize in the open Fields: He therefore colour'd the mat∣ter, and perswaded the Tories, that no evil design was in∣tended against them; but Kernan replyed, they would be murthered if they hastened not away, which counsel of his they took, and departed with him: But the Informant be∣seeched the said Brethren not to let their Brothers death (the said Cormuck) go unrevenged, which they promised ac∣cordingly. XXXII. That a report was spread abroad, that Cormuck was slain near Ensign John Smiths, that he also was accessary to his death; which he in great fury sware to some persons, that he, nor any of his Family had a hand therein. XXXIII. That a difference happening between Mr. John Dermond, and Ensign John Smith, Dermond upbraiding him with de∣frauding the King of Excise, and of furnishing the Tories with Ammunition; the said Ensign alledging the said Dermond to be confederate with the Tories when Cormuck was killed, for to plunder the said Ensign's House, had not Cormuck's death prevented their design. The Ensign doubting what this dif∣ference might produce, and fearing some of the persons privy
to his and Lientenant Bakers, fails in relieving the Tories, sends for one of them that was more than ordinary acquaint∣ed therewith, by name William Murphy, then Servant to Lieutenant Baker, and under pretence of having him to ride before his Daughter to Dundalk, sent him with a Note to the Bayly to have him Imprisoned, which when the Bayly saw, did according to the order given him therein from Smith. XXXIV. That Two Brethren of Cormucks, who the Deponent wil∣led to revenge their Brothers Blood upon the Tories, one day espied Hanlon, and came to the Informant, and made him ac∣quainted therewith, complaining, they were uncapable of prosecuting the matter, by reason they feared their Master, the said Ensign, who pretended they sought after his Life, and therefore search was made after them, in order to their Imprisonment; and that the Ensign might have no just pre∣tence, desired the Informant to satisfie him with the truth, that no such thing was thought on; wherefore the Infor∣mant repaired thither, and enquired what might be the cause of the Ensign's suspition of the foresaid matter, seeing Cor∣muck's dying words rendered him innocent of his Blood, and that his Brethren never thought nor spoke thereof? the En∣sign's Wife replied, that her Husband might have killed Cor∣muck at his pleasure since he became a Tory, but would not molest him, and that it was Kernan suggested her Husband that Cormuck's Brothers had a design to do him a mischief; but the Informant replied, that Kernan and the Murderer of Cormuck should experimentally feel the reward of so treache∣rous a fact, for he expected some good service should shortly be performed by Captain Butler, at his return to that Coun∣trey. XXXV. That the Deponent went to the said Spies (viz.) Cor∣muck's brethren, and told them he had satisfied the Ensign Smith's Wife concerning them, and therefore desired them to be active in their business, in spying out Redmond, and others of his Companions; the next night following the De∣ponent was sent for to Christen a Child to one of the said Ensign Smith's Tenants, who was a near Kinsman to the said
Cormuck lately Murdered by Neal, before the Informant was approached the said House, came a party of the Militia and took one of Cormuk's brethren, and one Gurtain, formerly a Footman to him (the said Cormuck); the Deponent no sooner lighted off his Horse, being come to the said House, but the Deponent was apprehended by the Soldiers, and taken into their Custody, where he had not been but till the next morning, ere he desired leave from the Soldiers to go to Dundalk, and there stay in a certain Inn till they came to the said Town; which request was granted, &c. XXXVI. That the Informant remained in the place appointed till about Noon, expecting the said Ensign Smith, who at length came, and was met with by the Informant at the Bayliffs, who required the Informant to put in Bail, for he was to give in testimony on the Kings behalf of several matters; the Informant replied, that the Ensign was most fit to be Bail in that case, seeing he had brought him thither; but Smith an∣swered, had he been taken by another, he should not in the least deny the Informant so small a kindness. After this, the said Informant Enquired of the Bayly what might be the cause of his being taken? To which he replied, That it was for being with the said Cormuck at his death. Upon which answer, the Deponent told the Bayliff of the whole design, and that Captain Butler was concerned to have it effected by the means of Cormuck who was treacherously slain; and af∣ter he gave Bail, departed. XXXVII. That in pursuit of the forementioned design, the Infor∣mant employed Two more to have Hanlon the great Rebel, and Neal that kill'd Cormuck, trepan'd, and having some in∣telligence that Smith and Baker designed to set at liberty those that before they had Imprisoned,Note what brave Officers here are, that can be High-way men, and pretend to be some of the Kings best Subjects at one and the same time. which persons the Informant knew to be Messengers between the Tories and the said Smith and Baker, being by them employed to carry Pow∣der and Ammunition to supply the Tories, and divide the spoil that at sundry times was Robbed from the Countrey by the Tories; therefore the Informant acquainted the said Captain Butler therewith, and further told him, that the said persons might be serviceable for Evidence angainst Smith and
Baker if they were looked after, seeing they were guilty of Receiving and partaking of the Tories Robberies, and furnishing them as aforesaid; and also Captain Cox being then newly made Bayliff, the Informant desired him not to take Bail for the said Prisoners, to the end they might be more useful to discover the said confederacy; and also the Informant told the Captain, that he had employed two per∣sons, with one of Cormuck's brethren, to find out the Tories, which he hoped would answer his end in a little time; and the Captain answered, he would be sure to be at home the Week following to give him his assistance. XXXVIII. That the Informant acquainted Captain Cox with the same matter that he had Captain Butler, desiring him to detain the said Prisoners, lest upon their enlargement, Smith and Baker might oblige them to be silent in what the Informant expect∣ed they would declare, which he was sure they were privy to; the which the Captain promised to do, and also to be secret therein till it might more fully appear. XXXIX. That Ensign Smith determining to have the Prisoners re∣leased, found himself prevented, and was told they were not to be set at liberty till Sir Hans Hamilton came to Town; and the said Smith also learnt this was done by the Informants means, at which the said Ensign was enraged, considering his own Life, and Son-in-law Lieutenant Baker, might be en∣dangered by the testimony of the foresaid persons in Prison, if they should discover; and that it seemed the more dubious, by reason the releasment of the said Witnesses must be ac∣cording to the Informants advice; thereupon the said Ensign Smith made grievous complaints unto several Gentlemen, that his House was in agitation to be burnt, and himself and Family destroyed by the Tories, under pretence that he had occasioned the death of Cormuck, and that one Edmond Murphy a Priest, was the Ring-leader of this design; and having informed the Deponents Father with those things, the Father of the said Informant sent for him, demanding the Reasons, and giving him sharp rebukes; to which the Informant made answer, that he never had given an Infor∣mation against the said Ensign in his life; of which the Depo∣nent's
Father satisfied the said Ensign Smith,The Reader must observe that the In∣formant did not promise his Father he would not discover his villany, by that yet he had not. who so far ad∣hered to the matter, that he dismissed those persons, who for several nights before guarded his House. XL. That about the time appointed that Captain Butler pro∣mised to come home, came Hugh Murphy (who was em∣ployed to spy after Hanlon and his confederates) to the De∣ponent, and told him, if Captain Butler and his Soldiers were ready, he could direct them to the place where the said Hanlon and company were; the Deponent hearing this news, posted on Horseback to Dundalk, leaving the Spy half a mile distant from the Town, and coming to Captain Cox, queried if Captain Butler was come thither? But the said Captain Cox replied, he was not expected till two or three nights after. Then the Deponent related to the Cap∣tain what an opportunity was lost, for want of the said Cap∣tain Butler's being at home; for he further added, how the Spy the Informant had imployed, brought him intelligence where they were that spoiled the Countrey; to which, the said Captain Cox answered, the Informant might have a Company of Soldiers to go with the Spy to take Hanlon; but the Deponent said, the said Spy had been before fright∣ened by Ensign John Smith, and was confident the Soldiers would betray him, except he might have conference with the Captain himself; and therefore the Spy at the Infor∣mants return, said, he had rather stay till Captain Butler came home, and that in the interim he would, by the means of some Stratagem, cause the Tories to remain thereabouts, which he did by Stealing their Horses, and bringing them remote from the place where they were, and left them there: The Deponent's brethren and others finding the said Horses, brought them to Sir Hans Hammilton (not knowing the designs) and pursued all such as enquired after them. XLI. That the Informant, when Sir Hans Hamilton and Captain Butler came to Dundalk, informed Sir Hans of the several transactions, and of Smith and Baker; so that the said Sir Hans desired Captain Moore to draw up the Deponent's in∣formation against Smith and Baker, which he accordingly did: but the Deponent desired their secrecy therein till
Hanlon the great Rebel might be taken, which the Depo∣nent hoped in a short time to effect; and added, that Cap∣tain Butler's absence was the cause of his escape hitherto; but also informed them, if they in the least doubted of the truth of his Informations against the said Smith and Baker, he could produce Forty to confirm the same, so they might come privately; and at that instant, one Phelemy Murphy passing by, was called in, and asked, if ever he saw Smith or Baker in company with the Tories, associating themselves together in any recreations? and whether he was sworn to keep secrecy of their meeting? And the said Phelemy re∣plied to this purpose (to Sir Hans) Dear Sir, do not give occasion that I may be hanged or murdered, between the Soldiers and the Tories; and moreover I have my Fathers Curse, if I give an Information against Smith or Baker; but the verity I shall declare to your self another time, but not by way of Information. Then replied Sir Hans, I perceive the Priest speaks the truth, and you shall; and you, quoth he to the said Phelemy shall appear at the Assize; but he an∣swered the contrary, that he would not; and hereupon Sir Hans departed to another Room. XLII. That the Deponent had information by the Wife of the said Spy (viz.) Hugh Murphy, that he kept a feigned cor∣respondency with the Tories, and that he went in great danger, by reason they began to have some suspition of him, for that he would not be competitor in their Robberies; whereupon the Deponent went to the Captain, and made him acquainted with all, and the said Captain repaired to Sir Hans Hamilton to have his advice therein, which done, came to the Deponent, and ordered him to acquaint the Spy to give them notice of the first and most convenient oppor∣tunity in that matter; the Said Spy did dayly send the State of the Tories, which the Deponent communicated to Cap∣tain Butler in writing by a certain Damsel, to avoid suspi∣tion. XLIII. That about the latter end of October, 1679. the said Spy came to the Informant, and told him that the Tories would endeavour to get a booty about Dundalk, and that himself
would come along with them, and that when they went to hide it till the time of distribution, he would give the Depo∣nent cognisance of the place, that the Company of Soldiers might be placed in Ambush hard by, that when the said To∣ries came to divide the spoil, they might be surprized. XLIV. That about this matter, the Informant repaired to the said Captain Butler, and made him acquainted with the opportuni∣ty that seemed to offer it self; the said Captain in his answer, among other discourses, told the Deponent, that one Esq Hill, a Privy Councellor, designed to Imprison the Deponent, wherefore the said Deponent desired the Captain to accompa∣ny him to the said Esq Hill, to know what he had to alledg against him, which the Captain did; coming there, the said Captain gave Esq Hill to understand the Informants business, which was to know what he had committed worthy of cen∣sure. The said Esq having called the Informant, required of him by what authority he exercised his Priestly function? The Deponent replied, by the same that all the Priests in the King∣dom did theirs. But the said Hill proceeded to examine, whether the Deponent was authorized by Oliver Pluncket to say Mass? But the Deponent answered, Sir Hans Hamilton was able to give a good account of him; and that he thought there was no such necessity for so strict an examination, seeing he was bound over to prosecute such matters as Sir Hans was acquainted with, as an Evidence in the Kings behalf. With that, the said Hill enquired if the Informant knew one Done∣ley, or did he in Verbo Sacerdotis, receive any Knives from the Tories? The Informant answered, he never received any Knives from the Tories in his Life. Lieutenant Baker being present, told the said Hill, that the Informant maintained continual correspondency with the Tories; to which the De∣ponent replied, that he never was so familiar with them as to be Gossip to their Children, nor associated himself in their company, as the Lieutenant had done in several places, and to the knowledg of many persons that could prove many more facts of that kind against him than he was aware of: At the hearing of this reply from the Deponent, the said Lieu∣tenant Baker requested leave from the said Hill to take off the Informants Head, rather than he should be admitted to speak any further; which the said Hill denied him. The Deponent further added, that he offered the said Baker his service against
the Tories, which he would never accept of; at which Baker hereat, said, who should accept service at the hands of an excommunicated person, as the Deponent appeared to be? for that himself was assured he was excommunicated by his Pri∣mat (viz.) Pluncket, and withal appealed to Captain Boult∣on, to bear witness what he said was very true: The Depo∣nent being before well satisfied with the said Boulton and Ba∣kers confederacy with Pluncket, to carry on the Plot by means of the Tories, as well as conniving at Pluncket's Provincial Councel for the destruction of all the Protestants; and the said Baker delivering a Letter (wherein consisted the weal of the Three Kingdoms) to inform the said Pluncket and the rest of the Conspirators, of the diabolical councel at Artpatrick, that therefore the Deponent dared not to take any notice of the said Plot before them, desired only, that the said Hill and the rest would bear him witness, that the said Baker said the Deponent was denounced excommunicated; acquainting them further, if he was censured by them worthy of Impri∣sonment, he would relieve himself by a Habeas Corpus, to have the matter to Dublin, and that there he would manifest all their Knavery; but the said Hill answered, he would hinder his Habeas Corpus. The Deponent in the words of Paul, re∣plied, Thou whited wall, shall I not have the priviledg of the Law? Upon which, Hill wrote a Mittimus, that Edmond Mur∣phy should be sent to Prison without Bail or Mainprize. The Deponent not desparing of hope altogether, that when Sir Hans Hamilton came to the Countrey he should have his en∣largement procured; in the interim the Deponent made his application to one Mr. William Hetherington, shewed him the several abuses that was put upon him, for two things; First, his endeavour to suppress the Tories. Secondly, his making manifest that the Kingdom was privately to be invaded by a foraign enemy, through the means of several Conspirators. To which relation Mr. Hetherington scarce gave credit; but for the better confirmation, James Mackenna, the said Plunc∣ket's man, came to the Deponent in Prison, and saying in the hearing of Mr. Hethrington, how treacherous the Deponent had been in betraying the councel held at Artpatrick afore∣said; and that he was sure Primat Pluncket would never be concerned to have him released, (the said Mackenna not at all doubting that Mr. Hetherington took notice of his dis∣course) but the Deponent told him, if it was to be done again, he should do it the very next day.
XLV. That the Spy whom the Deponent had formerly employed to find out the Tories, was now encouraged by Captain Butler and Sir Hans Hamilton to keep correspondency with the Tories, and accompany them, till such time he might have an opportunity to betray them all at once; the said To∣ries with the forementioned Spy, having obtained their hearts desire, by surprizing a considerable booty near Dundalk, be∣ing in company with Fourteen of the said Rebels, who laid up the prize in a place for that purpose till it might be di∣vided at a time appointed; at this time the said Spy conclu∣ded it a convenient opportunity to have his end accomplish∣ed, by placing an ambush near where the said booty was hid, and that at the time of distributing they might be taken; hereupon the Spy enquired narrowly after the Deponent, and hearing that he was apprehended, sends his Brothers Wife to acquaint him, that all that formerly he endeavoured to ac∣complish, was just now brought near to a period, if he the said Spy might be but secured, and that nothing might be laid to his charge for accompanying the Tories, seeing it was to a good end. Upon this Information, the Informant sends for Mr. Hetherington, to whom he imparted the whole matter, which the said Hetherington hearing, promised the Spy Ten pounds of his own Money for his good service, and forth∣with desired the Deponent might be careful to let Captain Butler and Captain Cox be acquainted therewith; and fur∣ther, the Deponent desired the said Captain Butler, that one of the Witnesses whom the Doponent named, (who after was cast into Prison for a pretended misdemeanour) might be privately bound over to prosecute the matter, which Cap∣tain Butler condescended to; but Captain Cox would by no means take Bail for him, for that Smith and Baker had order∣ed the contrary, and being overseers of the said Prison, pre∣vail'd to have the Witnesses transported without Judg, Jury, Witness, or Accuser: In this Confusion, the opportunity of apprehending the Tories as aforesaid, was lost. XLVI. That Mr. Hetherington, by intelligence he received at Dundalk, both from the Witnesses and others, was so well satisfied in the matter; so that he reproved Smith and Baker
of their unjust proceedings, as well in reference to the Tories, as to the Letter the Deponent intrusted them with, touching the Provincial Council, mentioned in the Deponent's Narra∣tive of the Plot; withal the said Mr. Hetherington desired the Deponent not to concern himself with Sir Hans Hamilton, or any other, till such time he might be relieved by a Habeas Cor∣pus; and himself engaged all he was worth upon the Depo∣nent's just and lawful Cause; after which, the said Mr. Hethe∣rington departed to Dublin and Imprisoned Pluncket; the next day following, the Deponent sent him many considerable Papers touching the Plot, and Money to have himself, the said Deponent, relieved by a Habeas Corpus, which things the Informant sent by the Jaylor's Brother, who delivered nei∣ther Money nor Papers to Mr. Hetherington, but only the Pope's Bull, which the Messenger thought to be some Lease appertaining to the Deponent, otherwise had retained that also. The said Hugh, the Jaylor's Brother, having betrayed the Deponent, by keeping his Papers and Money, and disco∣vering the matters therein contained to Smith and Baker, who understood, that one Art Murphy (which the Deponent na∣med for a Witness) had somewhat to inform against them, got a Mittimus from Captain Boulton to have him committed (for some pretended misdemeanour) to Prison, where he was yoaked and chained, which the Deponent finding fault with, was served the same sauce, whereas he before had his liberty to go abroad with his Keeper, keeping the said Deponent from any sustenance from Monday to Friday, only a piece of Bread that one of the Prisoners stole, the Deponent partook of, this being done by Smith and Baker's command. XLVII. That during this extremity of the Deponent's, my Lord Lieutenant (viz.) the Duke of Ormond, was made acquaint∣ed by Capt. Butler and Capt. Cox, that a certain Priest was grosly abused, for giving information in the Kings behalf of a Confederacy that was between some of the Officers of the Ar∣my and the Tories, which the said Priest, or Deponent, de∣sired to be secretly kept till the Tories might be taken; which matter the Duke of Ormond hearing, took it in further con∣sideration. The Deponent's Friends hearing of his troubles, requested the Jaylor that he would take the Prisoner to his own House, for which he should be considered, and that the Informant should be perswaded to give in Bail in a short time,
which request of theirs was granted: In the interim all the Petitions that the Informant sent to the D. of Ormond, and other Letters to Mr. Hetherington (then in Dublin) were stop∣ped in the Post-office, by the means of the said Smith and Baker. The Deponent having obtained more liberty than before, feared it should cost him his Life, therefore determined to go to Dublin, and leave his Brother security till he returned, be∣ing before informed by the said Mr. Hetherington, in a Letter, that he had taken Pluncket, and that a Habeas Corpus would be ready for the Deponent; which he no sooner understood, but went (without taking notice of any person) with all the expedition he could for Dublin, and at his arrival acquainted several there how he had escaped the hands of violence; and at that instant the Informants grievances was carried before the D. of Ormond again, who sent for the Deponent the next day, to whom he related the whole business of the Officers and Tories; to all which, the said Duke promised, that justice should be done, and that the Country should be redressed, and withal, acknowledged, that he had received the Depo∣nent's Letter, enclosed in Capt. Butlers, touching these mat∣ters, a year before. XLVIII. That the Informant, immediately after this conference with the D. of Ormond, repaired to Mr. Hetherington, and related to him all the passages that had past between them, particular∣ly, of the Excommunication that was denounced against the Informant, that malice was the original cause thereof; to which the said Hetherington replied, that it was almost impos∣sible, as well as improbable, to have any justice done against the said Pluncket, by reason of his strong faction, nor in any other matters relating thereunto; the Informant not taking much notice of the reply, informed the said Hetherington, if he would accompany the Deponent to the North, he would produce evidence to prove the whole that before he had re∣vealed, and more also. XLIX. That many days after, the Informant remained in and about the D. of Ormond's House, attending for a Warrant that he promised against Smith and Baker, and also to bring such Evi∣dence as was in Gaol to testifie in that behalf; at length an
Order of Reference was granted to Sir Hans Hamilton, and a Letter to take Bail for such Evidence as was in Prison afore∣said, which the Deponent no sooner received, but acquaint∣ed Mr. Hetherington, who went with the Deponent, under the denomination of a Fryer which was lately come from Rome, by which means he learned several matters relating to the Plot and other affairs: the Informant came to Sir Hans Ha∣miltons, and brought Bail with him for the Evidence afore∣said; but Sir Hans said, he would as well summons the rest that were not Imprisoned; in the mean time the Informant com∣plained he wanted safe conduct to prosecute his affairs, to which he also answered, there was no such necessity, seeing the D. of Ormond did think it needful to send such assistance at first: Hereupon the Informant consulted with Mr. Hether∣ington, and so determined to prosecute the design. L. That the said Lieutenant Baker, in the mean time, had in∣telligence of the Informant's Order of Reference from the Lord Lieutenant, came therefore with several Armed men to the Deponent's Meeting-place, with a design to kill him, but was disappointed, finding none but the Curat; notwithstand∣ing took the Informant's Brother, and plundered several of his Friends, and in the night time sent the Tories to find out the Informant and Mr. Hetherington, and ordered they should murther them; but in their pursuit the Deponent and his Friend escaped their hands, through the goodness of the Hor∣ses they rid on, both of the Soldiers and Tories, who made diligent search after them; hereupon the Deponent and the said Mr. Hetheringion saw it high time to remove from those parts, and staying for one or two nights within some Six miles of the place, in which time came the Wives of the Evi∣dences in Prison, with several of their Friends, and acquaint∣ed Mr. Hetherington and the Deponent, both by Letters and word of mouth, that the said Evidences and Prisoners could not support their lives under such miseries they endured by the means of Smith and Baker, the Gaoler not contenting himself to Bolt, Yoak, and Chain them, beating them with an Iron Bar (whereby they had lost much Blood) and this was to force them to sign an instrument for their transporta∣tion, so that their Evidence might not be given against the said Smith and Baker; hereupon Mr. Hetherington repaired to acquaint the D. of Ormond, which transactions he accor∣dingly related, and left it to his consideration.
LI. That the Informant also hastening to Dublin to bring in more of the matters to my Lord Lieutenant, was drawing up his Examination, when one Hugh Mac Canna, who made a Pro∣clamation throughout the City, that the Informant was the cause of Pluncket's Imprisonment, the which Hugh was soon after taken by George Murphy, for not delivering the Papers of the Treason, when sent by the Deponent, along with the Bull, to Mr. Hetherington, by his hand is supposed to have delivered it to Pluncket, Smith or Baker; but he was soon re∣leased, alledging the Deponent accused none but such as were honest men; the Informants being imprisoned gave occasion to all the Primat's, as well as Smith and Baker's friends, to fill the Town with all manner of scandalous and ignominious Characters concerning the Deponent; others came to Prison, tempting him to Petition for to be transported to France; understanding also that Mr. Hetherington was concerned in Pluncket's Imprisonment, very diligent enquiry was made af∣ter him, a general report going up and down the City, that Two Rogues, for their own interest, intended to take a pre∣tended method to discover Treason to the Duke of Ormond, hoping to have Money for their reward; the one being ta∣ken, the other had escaped, and that Five hundred pound should be given to any that took him; and that the next Week there was great hopes he should be proclaimed a Rebel; some came to the Deponent also, and promised him Money and liberty, to declare where the said Hetherington was. LII. That the Head of the forementioned Spy, that the Infor∣mant employed to look after the Tories,This was a notable Sol∣dier, and de∣serves to be Chronicled for a Cham∣pion, that could kill a man when he was not able to resist. was brought to the D. of Ormond, as a piece of good service done by Lieute∣nant Baker, notwithstanding his being authorized by Sir Hans Hamilton and Capt. Butler to betray the Tories, under pre∣tence of correspondency with them, which he was allowed in. The manner of Killing of the said Spy, was when he was at his House sick in Bed, Lieutenant Baker came and knock'd out his Brains with the But-end of a Pistol or Mus∣ket, afterwards cut off his Head. That afterwards, the said Baker taxed the Countrey for Money for his Head, as if he had been a proclaimed Tory, who never was concerned in
any thing, but as one employed to be serviceable against the Tories; neither was he accounted any other by the Country, nor ever proclaimed. LIII. That notwithstanding the Deponent's Petitions, the fore∣mentioned Witnesses were transported by the means of Sir John Davis; during the Informant's Imprisonment, arrived at Dublin from the North of Ireland, a certain Gentleman, by name John Curfy, who was a stranger altogether to the Informant, and being demanded the occasion of his coming to Town, said, he came to confirm the testimony of a cer∣tain Priest; for this he added, he could confirm what the said Priest had said, and relate much more of the like kind. The said person being brought under pretence of seeing the Deponent, was clapt up in Prison also, under the notion of several unknown Actions of Debt, and was threatned to be hang'd by my Lord Chief Justice Booth; and in that fright gave a Bill of his Hand for what was alledged to his charge, besides Ten pounds that he paid down, and made protesta∣tions, that he would deny that he had any thing to say on the Deponent's behalf; which done, he was dismissed. FINIS.
