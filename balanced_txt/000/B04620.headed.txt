On His Majesties most Gracious and Prudent Delivery of the Great Seal of England to the Right Honourable Sir HENEAGE FINCH Knight and Baronet His late AttornyGeneral. CEase, Cease, (fond Age) give over to complain: Leave off your murmurings, and griefs disdain. Papists, Fanaticks, all ill Sects must down, None but the pure must now approch the Crown. Our King like a wise Builder Now hath shown What Stones 'twas fit to use, and what to own. Alas! Great Kings and States must often do Things which necessities do urge them to; But when those great necessities are past, The Sun shews forth its own true Beams at last. What Loyal Heart will not rejoyce to hear, That Loyalty runs once more regular? (Our Liberties are kept by Cavaleir. The Church secure, then who can fear a State, That hth a Supporter so fortunate? Wise, Just and Eloquent, but to express His many Vitues wou'd but make them less. He's known so well, 'twere needless to set forth, Or more to say, then that he's ris'n by's worth. His Praise most due,'tis folly to proclaim, All know his Praise who have but heard of's Name, He wants no Character who'th so much fame, Oh happy Seal, with such a trusty Friend! May there be no divorse till life doth end; May the Seal ne'r be superseeded here, Till Heaven commands the Keeper to come there: And may Heavens Messenger prove very slow In pity to us; who are left below. The Church, the State, all must confess 'twas fit To have the Seal for Finch, and him for it. No halting lines, none but true Eloquence Must be spoke here, or sent abroad from hence. No swelling State, must now o'relook our Head, The Keepers looks can strike a Province dead. Long may he live to give our King content, And be endeared to his Parliament May we n'er want to rule the Common-Weal A Stewart, or a Finch to keep the Seal. By a well wisher to King and Countrey. Printed in the Year MDCLXXIII.
