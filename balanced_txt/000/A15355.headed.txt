THE Painfull Aduentures of Pericles Prince of Tyre. Being The true History of the Play of Pericles, as it was lately presented by the worthy and ancient Poet Iohn Gower. AT LONDON. Printed by T. P. for Nat: Butter, 1608.
The Argument of the whole Historie. ANtiochus the Great, who was the first foun∣der of Antioch, the most famous Citty in all Syria, hauing one onelie daughter, in the prime and glory of her youth, fell in most vnnaturall loue with her; and what by the power of his perswasions, and feare of his tyranny, he so preuailed with her yeelding heart, that he be∣came maister of his desires; which to continue to himself, his daughter, being for her beauty desired in marriage of many great princes, he made this law, That whoso presumed to de∣sire her in marriage, and could not vnfold the meaning of his questions, for that attempt should loose his life. Fearelesse of this Lawe, many Princes aduentured, and in their rashnesse perished: amongst the number PERICLES the Prince of Tyre, and neighbour to this tyrant King Antiochus, was the last who vndertooke to resolue this Riddle, which he accor∣dingly, through his great wisedome, performed: and finding both the subtiltie and sinne of the Tyrant, for his owne safetie fled secretly from Antioch backe to Tyre, and there acquain∣ted Helycanus a graue Counsell our of his with the procee∣dings, as also with his present feare what might succeed, from whose counsell he tooke aduise, for a space to leaue his king∣dome, and betake himselfe to trauell; to which yeelding, Pe∣ricles puts to sea, ariues at Tharsus, which he finds (thorow the dearth of corne) in much distresse: he there relieues Cleon and Dyonysa with their distressed City, with the prouision which he brought of purpose; but by his good Counsellour Hely∣canus hearing newes of Antiochus death, he intends for Tyre, puts againe to Sea, suffers shipwracke, his shippes and men
all lost, till (as it were) Fortune tyred with his mis-happes, he is throwne vpon the shoare, releeued by certaine poore Fi∣shermen, and by an Armour of his which they by chaunce dragged vp in their nettes, his mis-fortunes being a little re∣paired, Pericles arriues at the Court of good Symonides King of Pentapolis, where through his noblenesse both in Armes and Arts, he winnes the loue of faire Thaysa the kings daugh∣ter, and by her fathers consent marries her. In this absence of his, and, for which absence the Tyrians his subiects muteny, would elect Helycanus (whome Pericles ordained his substitute in his absence) their King, which pas∣sion of theirs Helycanus by his graue perswasions subdewed, and wonne them to goe in quest of their lost Prince Pericles: In this search he is found, and with his wife Thaysa, who is now with childe, and Lycorida her Nurse; hauing taken leaue of his kingly Father, puts againe for Tyre, but with the ter∣rour of a tempest at Sea, his Queene falles in trauell, is deli∣uered of a daughter, whome hee names Marina, in which childe-birth his Queene dies, she is throwne ouer boorde, at departure of whome Pericles altereth his course from Tyre, being a shorter cut, to his hoste Cleon in Tharsus; hee there leaues his yoong daughter to be fostered vp, vowing to him∣selfe a solitary & pensiue life for the losse of his Queene. Thaysa thus supposed dead, and in the seas buried, is the next morning on the shore taken vp at Ephesus by Cerimon a most skilfull Physition, who by his Arte practised vpon this Queene, so preuailed, that after fiue houres intraunced, she is by his skill brought to able health againe, and by her owne request, by him placed to liue a Votary in Dianaes Temple at Ephesus. Marina Pericles sea-borne daughter, is by this gro∣wen to discreete yeares, she is enuied of Dyonysa Cleons wife, her foster mother, for that Marinaes perfection exceedeth a daughter of hers, Marina by this enuy of hers should haue beene murthered, but being rescued by certaine Pyrates, is as it were reserued to a greater mishap, for by them she is ca∣ried to Metelyne, sold to the deuils broker a bawd, to haue bin
trained vp in that infection, shee is courted of many, and how wonderfully she preserues her chastitie. Pericles returnes from Tyre toward Tharsus, to visite the hospitable Cleon, Dyonysa, and his yoong daughter Marina, where by Dyonysaes dissembling teares, and a Toombe that was erected for her, Pericles is brought to beleeue, that his Marina lies there buryed, and that shee died of her naturall death, for whose losse hee teares his haire, throwes off his garments, forsweares the societie of men, or any other com∣fort. In which passion for many moneths continuing, hee at last arriues at Metelyne, when being seene and pittied by Ly∣simachus the Gouernour, his daughter (though of him vn∣knowen so) is by the Gouernour sent for, who by her excel∣lent skill in Song, and pleasantnesse in discourse, with rela∣ting the story of her owne mishap, shee so winnes againe her fathers lost sences, that hee knowes her for his childe, shee him for her father; in which ouer-ioy, as if his sences were nowe all confounded, Pericles falles asleepe, where in a dreame is by Diana warned to goe to Ephesus, and there to make his sacrifice. Pericles obayes, and there comes to the knowledge of Thaysa his wife, with their seuerall Ioyes that they three so strangely diuided, are as strangely mette. Lysimachus the Gouernour marrieth Marina, and Pericles leauing his mourning, causeth the bawde to be burned. Of his reuenge to Cleon and Dyonysa, his rewarding of the Fi∣shermen that releeued him, his iustice toward the Pyrats that made sale of his daughter, his returne backe to his kingdome, and of him and his wifes deaths. Onely intreating the Rea∣der to receiue this Historie in the same maner as it was vnder the habite of ancient Gower the famous English Poet, by the Kings Maiesties Players excellently presented.

THE Painfull Aduentures of PERICLES Prince of Tyre. The first Chapter. WHerein Gower describes how Antiochus surnamed the Great committed incest with his daughter, and be∣headed such as sued to her for marriage, if they could not resolue his question, placing their heades vpon the top of his Castle gate, whereby to astonish all others that came to attempt the like. THe great and mighty king Antio∣chus, who was as cruell in ty∣ranny, as hée was powerfull in possessions, séeking more to en∣rich himselfe by she wes, than to renown his name by vertue, cau∣sed to be built the goodly Cittie of Antioch in Syria, and called it af∣ter his owne name, as the chief∣est seate of all his Dominions, and principall place of his abode. This Antiochus had increase by his Quéene one onely daughter, so excellent in beauty, as if Nature and all Perfection had long studied to séeme onely absolute at her birth. This Ladie growing to like ripenesse of age, as shée had full endowment of outward ornaments, was re∣sorted
vnto by many youthfull Princes, who desired her in marriage, offering to make her Ioynture as noble in pos∣sessions, as shée by beauty was royall in her selfe. While the King her father euermore requiring deliberation vpon whome rather than other to bestow this his so inestimable a Iewell, he beganne sodainely to haue an vnlawfull con∣cupiscence to growe in himselfe, which hée augmented with an outragious flame of cruelty sparkling in his hart, and accompted her so worthy in the world, that shée was too worthy for any, but himselfe. Thus being wrapped with this vnnaturall loue, he sustained such a conflict in his thoughts, wherein Madnesse puts Modesty to flight, giuing ouer his affections to the vnlawfulnesse of his will, rather then subdued them with the remembraunce of the euill hée had then in practise, so that not long after comming into his daughters Chamber, and commaun∣ding all that were néere at her attendance to depart, as if he had had some carefull and fatherly busines, the necessi∣tie of whose import desired some priuate conference with her, he beganne to make motion of that vniust loue to her, which euen Lust it selfe, had it not in a father béene so bra∣sed with impudencie, would haue blusht but euen to haue thought vpon. Much perswasion, though to little reason, he vsed, as, that he was her father, whome shée was bound to obey, he was a King that had power to commaund, he was in loue, and his loue was resistlesse, and if resistlesse, therefore pittilesse, either to youth, blood, or beauty: In briefe, he was a tyrant and would execute his will. These wordes thus vttered with that vehement passion which such sinnefull Louers fitte themselues vnto in such desires, and such immodest sillables were by him contracted toge∣ther, that my penne grubbes to recite them, and made the schoole of his daughters thoughts, (wherein were neuer taught such euills) to wonder at the strangenesse, as vn∣derstanding them not, and at last, to demaund of her vn∣kingly father, what hée meant by this, when he forget∣ting
the feare of heauen, loue to his childe, or reputation amongst men; though by her withstoode with prayers and teares, (while the power of weakenesse could withstand) throwing away all regard of his owne honesty, hée vnloo∣sed the knotte of her virginitie, and so left this wéeping braunch to wyther by the stocke that brought her foorth; so fast came the wet from the sentinells of her ransackt cittie, that it is improper to say they dropped and rayned downe teares, but rather, that with great flouds they powred out water. It is beyond imagination to thinke whether her eyes had power to receiue her sorrowes brine so fast as her heart did send it to them. In briefe, they were nowe no more to be called eyes, for griefes water had blinded them: and for wordes, she had not one to vtter, for be∣twixt her hearts intent, and tongues vtterance, there lay such a pile of lamentable cogitations, that she had no lei∣sure to make vp any of them into wordes, till at the last, a Nurse that attended her comming in, and finding her face blubbered with teares, which shée knew were strange guests to the table of her beauty, first standing in amaze thereat, at last, by the care shée had in charge of her, be∣ing more inheartned; Deare childe and Madam (quoth shée) why sit you so sorrowfully? which question, getting way betwixt griefe and her vtteraunce, Oh my beloued Nurse, answered the Lady, euen now two noble names were lost within this Chamber, the name of both a Fa∣ther, and a Child. The meaning of which secret the Nurse vnderstanding not, shée intreated her to be more plaine, that by knowing the cause of her griefe, shée might vse meanes to redresse it, or else, that her selfe in her owne wisedome would alay the violence of that tempest which did wrong to so goodly a building. But shée loath to be the bellowes of her owne shame, and blushing more to re∣hearse than her Father was to commit, sate sighing, and continued silent, vntill Antiochus, not satisfied with the fruite obtained by his former desire, returned, and like
him that by stealth hath filched a taste from foorth a goodly Orchard, is not therewith contented, but eyther wait∣eth his opportunity to steale, till hée be glutted with his stealth, or so aduenturous, that hée is taken, to his euer∣lasting shame; so this Antiochus comming backe into the Chamber, and finding his daughter as full of wette, as winter is, commaunded the absence of the Nurse (which shée accordingly obeying) he beganne to perswade her, that actions past are not to be redeemed, that whats in secret done, is no sinne, since the concealement excuses it, that euills are no euills, if not thought vpon, and that himselfe her Father had that power to gag all mouthes from speak∣ing, if it were knowen. Besides her state, his greatnes, his kingdome, her beauty, were ornaments enow to draw the greatest Princes to ioyne with her in marriage, and hée would further it. So with these and such like perswa∣sions preuayling with his daughter, they long continued in these foule and vniust imbracements, till at last, the custome of sinne made it accompted no sinne. And while this wicked Father shewed the countenaunce of a louing fire abroade in the eyes of his subiects, notwithstanding at home he reioyceth to haue played the parte of a husband with his owne childe, with false resemblaunce of marri∣age: and to the intent he might alwayes enioy her, he in∣uented a strange pollicie, to compell away all suters from desiring her in marriage, by propounding strange questi∣ons, the effect and true meaning whereof was thus pub∣lished in writing, Whoso attempteth and resolueth me of my Question, shall haue my Daughter to wife: But whoso at∣tempteth and faileth, shall loose his head. Which will of his, when Fame had blowne abroade, and that by this his Lawe there was found a possibilitie for the obtayning of this Lady, such was the singular re∣port of her surpassing beautie, that many Princes, and men of great Nobilitie, to that purpose repaired thither, who not béeing able to explane his Riddle propounded, lost
their heades, which to the terrifying of others that should attempt the like, were placed for open view on the toppe of his Castle gate. The second Chapter. How Pericles arriuing at Antioch, resolued the Kings Que∣stion: And how Thalyart Antiochus Steward was sent to murther him. VVHilest Antiochus continued thus exercising his tyranies on the liues of seuerall prin∣ces, Pericles the Prince of Tyre, wonne with the wonderfull report of this Ladies beauty, was (as other Princes before) drawne to the vndertaking of this despa∣rate aduenture; and approching néere Antioch, where there were no sooner newes that he was comming, but there was as great a preparation for the receiuing of him, the Lords and Peeres in their richest ornaments to inter∣taine him. The people with their gréedy and vnsatisfied eyes to gaze vpon him; for in that part of the world there was in those dayes no Prince so noble in Armes, or excel∣lent in Artes, and had so generall and deserued a report by fame as Pericles Prince of Tyre. Which drew both Péere and People, with a ioyfull and frée desire to allow him their imbracements, and to wish him happy successe, requiring no other but such a happy Soueraigne to hope in: for so cunningly had Antiochus dealt in this incest with his daughter, that it was yet vnsuspected of the née∣rest that attended him. With which solemnity and suffra∣ges, being brought into the presence of the tyrant, and by him demaunded the cause of his arriuall at Antioch: and being by the Prince answered, that it was in loue to his daughter, and in hope to enioy her by resoluing of his que∣stion.
Antiochus then first beganne to perswade him from the enterprise, and to discourage him from his procée∣dings, by shewing him the frightfull heads of the former Princes, placed vpon his Castle wall, and like to whome he must exspect himselfe to be, if like them (as it was most like) hée failed in his attempt. But Pericles armed with these noble armours, Faithfulnesse and Courage, and making himselfe fitte for Death, if Death prooued fitte for him, replyed, That he was come now to méete Death wil∣lingly, if so were his misfortune, or to be made euer for∣tunate, by enioying so glorious a beauty as was inthrond in his princely daughter, and was there now placed be∣fore him: which the tyrant receiuing with an angry brow, threw downe the Riddle, bidding him, since perswasi∣ons could not alter him, to reade and die, being in him∣selfe confident the mysterie thereof was not to be vnfolded: which the Prince taking vp, read aloude, the purpose of which was in these wordes: I am no viper, yet I feede On mothers flesh, that did me breede; I sought a husband, in which labour I found that kindnesse from a father: Hee's Father, Sonne, and Husband milde, I Mother, Wife, and yet his Childe: How this may be, and yet in two, As you will liue, resolue it you. Which secret, whilest Prince Pericles was reading, Antiochus daughter, whether it were, that shée now lo∣thed that vnnecessary custome in which shee had so long continued, or that her owne affection taught her to be in loue with his perfections, our storie leaues vnmentioned: but this for certaine, all the time that the Prince was studying with what trueth to vnfolde this darke Enigma, Desire flew in a robe of glowing blushes into her chéekes,
and loue inforced her to deliuer thus much from hir owne tongue, that he was sole soueraigne of all her wishes, and he the gentleman (of all her eies had euer yet behelde) to whome shée wished a thriuing happinesse. By which time the Prince hauing fully considered vpon what he had read, and found the meaning, both of the secret, and their abhominable sinnes, Antiochus rising vp, deman∣ded the solution of his Question, or to attend the sentence of his death. But the gentle Prince wisely foreknowing, that it is as dangerous to play with tyrants euills, as the Flie to sport with the Candles flame, rather séemed to dissemble what he knew, than to discouer his insight to Antiochus knowledge, yet so circumspectly, that Antio∣chus suspected, or at least, his owne knowen guilf made him so suspect, that hée had found the meaning of his foule desire, and their more foule actions; and séeming (as it were) then to pitty him whom now in soule he hated, and that he rather required his future happinesse, than any blemish to his present fortunes, he tolde him, that for the honour of his name, the noblenesse of his woorth, nay his owne déere and present loue to him (were it not against the dignity and state of his owne loue) in his tender and princely disposition, he could from the whole world select him as a choice husband for his daughter, since hée found him so farre wide from reuealing of the secret; yet thus farre hée should perceiue his loue should extend towardes him, which before time had not béene séene to stretch it selfe to any of those decaied princes, of whose falls, his eies were carefull witnesses, that for forty dayes he gaue him onely longer respite, if by which time (and with all the indeuours, counsell and aduise hée could vse) he can finde out what was yet concealed from him, it should be eui∣dent how gladly he would reioyce to ioy in such a sonne, rather than haue cause of sorrow by his vntimely ruine: And in the meane time, in his owne Court, by the roy∣altie of his entertainment hée should perceiue his welcom.
With which, and other such like gratulations their pre∣sences being diuided, Antiochus betooke himselfe to his Chamber, and princely Pericles to diligent consultations of his present estate, where when hée had a while conside∣red with himselfe, that what he had foūnd, was true, and this substantially was the true meaning of his Riddle, hée was become both father, sonne, and husband by his vn∣comely and abhorred actions with his owne child, and shée a deuourer of her mothers flesh, by the vnlawful couplings with her owne father, and the defiling of her mothers bed, and that this curtesie of Antiochus toward him, was but his hypocrisie, to haue his sinne concealed, till he found fit occasion to take fit reuenge (by the instrumēts of tyrants,) poyson, treason, or by any meanes, he resolued himselfe with all expedition, (the next darknesse being his best con∣ductor,) to flie backe to Tyre, which he effecting, and An∣tiochus being now priuate in his loeging, and ruminating with himselfe, that Pericles had found out the secret of his euill, which hée in more secret had committed; and know∣ing, that he had no power to rip him open to the world, and make his name so odious, that as now heauen did, so at the knowledge thereof all good men would contemne him. And in this study, not knowing how otherwise to helpe himselfe from this reproofe, he hastily calleth for one Thalyart, who was Steward of his housholde, and in many things before had receiued the imbracement of his minde; this Thalyart, (as Pericles fore-thought,) hée pre∣sently bribde with gold, and furthered with poyson, to be this harmles gentlemans executioner. To which purpose, as hée was about to receiue his othe, there came hastily a Messenger that brought him newes, the Tyrian shippes were that night departed his harbor, and that by intelli∣gence hée had learned the Prince also was fled for Tyre: at whose escape Antiochus storming, but not desisting from his former practise, hée commaunded his murthering mi∣nister Thalyart, to dispatch his best performance after him,
sometime perswading him, at others threatning him, in Tyre to sée him, in Tyre to kil him, or back to Antioch neuer to returne, which villainous mind of his as ready to yéeld, as the tyrant was to commaund. Thahart in all secresie is shipt from Antioch, while Pericles in this interim is arri∣ued at Tyre, where, knowing what was past, and fearing what might succéed, not to himself, but for the care he had of his subiects, remembring his power, too weake if occasion were offred, to contend with the greatnes of Antiochus: he was so troubled in mind, that no aduise of counsell could perswade him, no delights of the eye content him, neither any pleasure whatsoeuer comfort him, but still taking to heart, that should Antiochus make warre vpon him, as fearing lest he should speake his shame which he intended not to reueale, his misfortune should be the ruins of his harmelesse people. In this sorrowe, consisting one Helycanus a graue and wise Counsellor, of his (as a good Prince is euer knowne by his prudent Couusell) as much gréeued in mind for his Princes distemperature, as his Prince was troubled with the feare of his subiects mishap, came hastily into the chamber to him, and finding him so distasting mirth, that he abandoned all familiar society, he boldely beganne to reprooue him, and not sparingly told him, he did not wel so to abuse himselfe, to waste his body there with pyning sorrow, vpon whose safety depended the liues and prospe∣rity of a whole kingdome, that it was ill in him to doe it, and no lesse in his counsell to suffer him, without contra∣dicting it. At which, although the Prince bent his brow stearnely against him, he left not to go forward, but plain∣ly tolde him, it was as fit for him being a Prince to heare of his owne errour, as it was lawfull for his authority to commaund, that while he liued so shut vp, so vnseene, so carelesse of his gouernment, order might be disorder for all him, and what detriment soeuer his subiects should re∣ceiue by this his neglect, it were iniustice to be required at
his hands, which chiding of this good olde Lord, the gentle Prince curteously receiuing, tooke him into his armes, thankt him that he was no flatterer, and commaunding him to seat himselfe by him, he from poynt to poynt related to him all the occurrents past, and that his present sorrow was for the feare he had of Antiochus tyranny, his present studies were for the good of his subiects, his present care was for the continuing safety of his kingdome, of which himselfe was a member, which for slacknesse chide him: which vprightnes of this Prince calling teares into the olde mans eies, and compelling his knées to the earth, he humbly asked his pardon, confirming that what he had spoke, sprung from the power of his dutie, and grew not from the nature of disobedience. When Pericles no longer suffring such honored aged knées to stoope to his youth, lif∣ting him vp, desired of him that his counsell now would teach him how to auoide that danger, which his feare gaue him cause to mistrust: which in this manner was by the good Helicanus aduised, and by princely Pericles. yéelded vnto. That he should forth with betake himselfe to trauel, kéeping his intent whither, as priuate from his subiects, as his iourney was suddaine, that vpon his trust he should leaue the gouernment, grounding which counsel vpon this principle, Absence abates that edge that Presence whets. In bréefe, Pericles knew Helicanus trusty, and consented: so with store of corne and all necessaries fit for a kingly voy∣age, he insecret hath shipt himselfe from Tyre. Helycanus is protector of the kingdome in his absence: and our Story now hath brought vs to the landing of Thaliart, with a bo∣dy fraught as full of treason against Pericles, as his mai∣ster Antiochus was of tyranny, who no sooner a shore, but he had his eares fild with the generall lamentation of the Tyrian people, the aged sighed, the youth wept, all mour∣ned, helping one another how to make vp sorrow to the highest heape, as if with the absence of their Prince they had lost their Prince, and with his losse they had present
féeling of a succéeding ouerthrow, which the vilaine vnder∣standing, and finding himselfe, both berest of his purpose, and his maister of his intent, he, as traitors do, stole backe to Antioch resoluing Antiochus of what he knew: by which time, the clamors of the multitude being for a time pacified by the wisedome of Helicanus, and the peace of the common wealth by his prudence defended, our princely Pericles with spread sailes, faire winds, and full successe, is now arriued at Tharsus. The third Chapter. How Pericles arriuing at Tharsus releeued the Cittie, al∣most famished for want of foode, and how Helycanus sent him word of what had happened at Tyre, with his depar∣ture from Tharsus. PRince Pericles by the aduise of his good Counsellor Helicanus, hauing left Tyre, and intended his whole course for Thar∣sus, of which City lord Cleon was gouer∣nor, who at this instance with Dyonysa his wife, were relating the present mise∣ries wherein themselues and their Citty Tharsus consisted: the ground of which forced lamentation was, to sée the power of change, that this their City, who not two sum∣mers younger, did so excell in pompe, and bore a state, whom all hir neighbors enuied for her greatnes, to whom strangers resorted, as to the schoole of variety, where they might best enrich their vnderstandings with experience, whose houses were like so many Courts for Kings, rather than sléeping places for subiects, whose people were curi∣ous in their diet, rich in attire, enuious in lookes, where was plenty in aboundance, pride in fulnesse, nothing in scarcenesse, but Charitie and Loue, the dignitie of whose
pallats the whole riches of Nature could hardly satisfie, the ornaments of whose attire Art it selfe with all inuention could not content, are now so altered, that in steade of dowlny beds, they make their pillowes on boords, in stead of full furnished tables, hunger calles now out for so much bread, as may but satisfie life: sacke-cloth is now their wearing instead of silke, teares instead of inticing glaun∣ces, are now the acquaintance of their eyes, in briefe, riot hath héere lost all her dominion, and now is no excesse, but whats in sorrow, heere standes one wéeping, and there lies another dying, so sharpe are hungers téeth, and so ra∣uenous the deuouring mouth of famine, that all pittie is exiled betwéene the husband and the wife, nay all tender∣nesse betwéene the mother and the children, faintnesse hath now got that emperie ouer strength, there is none so whole to releeue the sicke, neither haue the liuing suffici∣encie to giue buriall to the dead. Thus while this Cleon Lord Gouernour of Tharsus, and Dyonysa his Lady, with interchanging wordes were describing the sorrows which their almost vnpeopled Citty felt, who from the height of multiplication were substracted, almost to nothing: (for, what is life,) if it want sustenaunce? a fainting messenger came slowely into them, his fearefull lookes described that he brought sorrowe, and in slowe wordes hée deliue∣red this, that vpon their coastes there was discouered a fléete of shippes making thitherward, which Cleon suppo∣sing to be an army, which some neighbour nation (taking aduantage of their present mishap) had sent for their vtter ouerthrows, hée commaunded the bringer, vpon their landing, to this purpose to salute their Generall, That Tharsus was subdewed before their comming, and that it was small conquest to subdew where there was no abilitie to resist, that they desired but this, that their citty might still stand, and that for the riches which their prosperitie had purchased, they fréely resigned to them, they though their enemies, (for humanities sake) in the place of brée∣ding,
would affoord them buriall. Pericles by this is lan∣ded, and no sooner entred into their vnshut gates, but his princely eies were partaking witnesses of their widowed desolation. The messenger by this also hath deliuered the pleasure of the Gouernour, which the Prince wéeping to attend, who rather came to reléeue than to ransacke, he demaunded of the fellow, where the Gouernour was, and foorth with to be conducted to him, which being effected, in the market place they mette, where Pericles without fur∣ther hinderance deliuered to him, that his thoughts were deceued, to suppose them for enimies, who were now come to them for comfortable friends, and those his shippes which their fears might cause them to think were fraugh∣ted with their destruction, were intreasured with corne for their reliefe: at which the féeble soules not hauing strength enough to giue a showte for ioy, gazing on him, and heauen, fell on their knées, and wept. But Peri∣cles going to the place of Iudgement, causing all the li∣uing to be assembled thither, thus fréely deliuered to them: You Cittizens of Tharsus, whom penury of victuall pin∣cheth at this present, Know you, that I Pericles Prince of Tyre am come purposely to reléeue you, in respect of which benefit I doubt not but you will be thus thankefull as to conceale my arriuing héere, and for a while to giue me safe harborage, and hospitalitie for my shippes and men, since by the tyranny of Antiochus, though not dri∣uen, yet for a while I am desirous to leaue mine owne Countrey, and continue my residence héere with you, in recompence of which loue, I haue brought with me a hun∣dred thousand bushells of wheate, which equally for your reléefe shall be distributed amongst you, each man paying for euery bushell eight péeces of brasse, the price bestowed thereon in my owne Country. At which, as if the verie name of bread only had power to renew strength in them, they gaue a great showt, offering their Citty to him as his owne, and their repaired strength in his defence: with
which corne their necessities being supplied, and euery man willingly paying his eight péeces of brasse, as hée had appoynted, Pericles demaunded for the Gouernour and the chiefe men of the gouernement, disdainining to bée a Merchant to sell corne, but out of his princely magnifi∣cence, bestowed the whole reuenew thereof to the beau∣tifying of their Citty. Which when the Cittizens vnder∣stoode, to gratifie these large benefites, and to acknow∣ledge him their patron and reléeuer sent them by the gods, they erected in the Market place a monument in the me∣moriall of him, and made his statue of brasse, standing in a Charriot, holding corne in his right hand, and spurning it with his left foote, and on the bases of the pillar where∣on it stoode, was ingrauen in great Letters this inscripti∣on: Pericles Prince of Tyre gaue a gift vnto the City of Thar∣sus, whereby he deliuered it from cruell death. So a while we desire the Reader to leaue Pericles heartning vp the de∣cayed Cittizens of Tharsus, and turne their eyes to good Helycanus at Tyre. Good Helycanus as prouident at home, as his Prince was prosperous abroade, let no occasionsip wherein hée might send word to Tharsus of what occurrents soeuer had happened in his absence, the chiefe of which was, that Thalyart by Antiochus was sent, with purpose to mur̄∣ther him, and that Antiochus, though fayling in his pra∣ctise by his absence, séemed not yet to desist from like in∣tents, but that he againe, suborned such like Instruments to the like treason, aduising him withall for his more cer∣taine safetie, for a while to leaue Tharsus, as a refuge too néere the reach of the tyrant. To which Pericles consen∣ting, hée takes his leaue of his hoste Cleon and Dyonysa, and the Cittizens as sory to leaue him, as sorrow can bée for the lacke of comfort.
The fourth Chapter. How Pericles puts foorth to Sea, suffers ship wrecke, is relie∣ued by certaine poore Fishermen, at last arriues at Simo∣nides Court, king of Pentapolis, where in feates of Armes hee exceedeth all the Princes that came to honor the birth day of his faire daughter Thaysa, and with purpose also to sue to hir for marriage. PKince Pericles hauing thus reléeued Thar∣sus, and bin warnd (for the auoydance of a greater danger) by his good Counsellour Helycanus to forsake the Citie, though not without much sorrow of the Cittizens for his departure, he is once againe at sea, sée∣kng anew ref uge, and accounting any countrey his best Inne, where he found the best safety. No sooner were his woodden castles floating on the vnconstant déepes: but as if Neptune himselfe, chiefe soueraigne of that watery em∣pire, would haue come in person to haue giuen calme gra∣tulations, and friendly welcomes to this curteous prince, the whole nation of the flouds were at quiet, there were no windes blustering, no surges rising, no raines showr∣ing, no tempest storming, but all calmenesse was vppon the face of this kingdome, only a troupe of chéerfull Dol∣phins, as Ambassadours, sent from their kingly Maister, came dauncing on the waters, for the entertaining of him. At which, his ioyfull Marriners being scarce from sight of land, with pleasant notes spread forth their comely sailes, and with their brasen kéeles, cut an easie passage on the gréene medowes of the flouds. At last, Fortune hauing brought him héere, where she might make him the fittest Tennis ball for her sport: euen as sodainely as thought this was the alteration, the Heauens beganne to thunder,
and the skies shone with falshes of fire: day now had no o∣ther shew but only name, for darkenes was on the whole face of the waters, hills of seas were about him, one some∣times tossing him euen to the face of heauen, while another sought to sincke him to the roofe of hell, some cryed, others laboured, hée onely prayed: at last, two rauenous bil∣lowes méeting, the one, with intent so stoppe vp all cla∣mour, and the other, to wash away all labour, his ves∣sells no longer able to wrestle with the tempest, were all split. In briefe, he was ship wrackt, his-good friends and subiectes all were lost, nothing left to helpe him but di∣stresse, and nothing to complaine vnto but his misery. O calamity! there might you haue heard the windes whist∣ling, the raine dashing, the sea roaring, the cables crac∣king, the tacklings breaking, the ship tearing, the men miserably crying out to saue their liues: there might you haue séene the sea searching the ship, the boordes fléeting, the goodes swimming, the treasure sincking, and the poore soules shifting to saue themselues, but all in vaine, for partly by the violence of the tempest, and partely thorow that dismall darkenesse, which vnfortunately was come vpon them, they were all drowned, gentle Pericles only excepted, till (as it were Fortune being tyred with this mishap) by the helpe of a plancke, which in this distresse hée got holde on, hée was, with much labour, and more feare, driuen on the shore of Pentapolis, where a while com∣plaining him of his mishaps, and accosing the Gods of this iniury doone to his innocencie, not knowing on what shoare, whether friend or foe he had, being certayne Fi∣shermen, who had also suffered in the former tempest, and had béene witnesses of his vntimely shipwracke: (the day being cléered againe) were come out from their homely cottages to dry and repaire their nettes, who being bust∣ed about their work, and no whit regarding his lamenta∣tion, passed away their labour with discourse to this pur∣pose, in comparing the Sea to Brokers and Usurers▪ who
séeme faire, and looke louely till they haue got men into their clutches, when one tumbles them, and an other tosses them, but seldome leauing vntill they haue suncke them. Againe comparing our rich men to Whales, that make a great shew in the worlde, rowling and tumbling vp and downe, but are good for little, but to sincke others: that the fishes liue in the sea, as the powerfull on shoare, the great ones eate vp the little ones: with which morall obseruations driuing out their labor, and prince Pericles, wondring that from the finny subiects of the sea these poore countrey people learned the infirmities of men, more than mans obduracy and dulnes could learne one of another: at length ouercharged with cold which the extreamity of wa∣ter had pressed him with, and no longer being able to en∣dure, he was compelled to demaund their simple helpe, of∣fering to their eares the mishap of his shipwracke, which hée was no sooner about to relate, but they remembred their eies, not without much sorrow, to haue bin the wit∣nesses thereof: and beholding the comely feature of this Gentleman, the chiefe of these fishermen was mooued with compassion toward him, and lifting him vp from the ground, himselfe with the helpe of his men, led him to his house, where with such fare as they presently had, or they could readily prouide, they with a hearty welcome feasted him, and the more to expresse their tendernesse to his mis∣fortune, the master dishabited himselfe of his outward ap∣parell to warme and cherish him, which curteous Pericles as curteously receiuing, vowing, if euer his fortunes came to their ancient height, their curtesies should not die vnrecompensed, and being somewhat repayred in heart by their reléefe, he demaunded of the country on the which he was driuen, of the name of the King, and of the manner of the gouernement. When the maister Fisher∣man commaunding his seruants to goe dragge vp some o∣ther nettes, which yet were abroade, he seated himselfe by him, and of the question he demaunded to this purpose,
resolued him; Our countrey héere on the which you are driuen sir, is called Pentapolis, and our good king thereof is called Symonides: the Good King call you him, quoth Pericles? Yea, and rightly so called sir, quoth the poore Fisherman, who so gouernes his kingdome with iustice and vprightnesse, that he is no readier to commaund, than we his subiects are willing to obey. He is a happy King, quoth Pericles, since he gaines the name of Good by his gouernement, and then demaunded how farre his Court was distant from that place: wherein he was resolued, some halfe a dayes iourney, and from point to point also informed, that the King had a princely daughter named Thaysa, in whome was Beauty so ioyned with Uertue, that it was as yet vnresolued which of them deserued the greater comparison: and in memory of whose birth day, her father yéerely celebrated feasts and triumphes, in the honour of which, many Princes and Knights from farre and remote Countries came, partly to approoue their chi∣ualry, but especially (being her fathers only child,) in hope to gaine her loue: which name of Chiualry to ap∣prooue, that all the violence of the water had not power to quench the noblenesse of his minde. Pericles sighing to himselfe he broke out thus: Were but my fortunes aun∣swerable to my desires some should féele that I would be one there. When as if all the gods had giuen a plaudite to his wordes, the Fishermen, who before were sent out by their Maister to dragge out the other nettes, ha∣uing found somwhat in the botome too ponderous for their strength to pull vp, they beganne to lewre and hallow to their Maister for more helpe, crying that there was a fish hung in their net, like a poore mans case in the Laws, it would hardly come out, but Industry being a preuayling workeman, before helpe came, vp came the Fish expec∣ted, but prooued indéede to be a rusty armour. At the name of which word Armour, Pericles being rowzed, he desired of the poore Fishermen, that he who better than they, was
acquainted with such furniture, might haue the view of it. In briefe, what hée could aske of them, was granted: the Armour is by Pericles viewed, and knowne to be a de∣fence which his father at his last will gaue him in charge to kéepe, that it might prooue to be a defender of the sonne, which he had knowne to be a preseruer of the father: so ac∣compting all his other losses nothing, since he had that a∣gayne, whereby his father could not challenge him of dis∣obedience: and thanking Fortune, that after all her cros∣ses, shée had yet giuen him somewhat to repayre his for∣tunes, begging this Armour of the Fishermen, and tel∣ling them, that with it hée would shew the vertue hée had learned in Armes, and trie his chiualry for their Prin∣cesse Thaysa, which they applauding, and one furnishing him with an old gowne to make Caparisons for his horse, which horse hée prouided with a Iewel, whom all the rap∣tures of the sea could not bereaue from his arme, and o∣ther furnishing him with the long side skirtes of their cas∣sockes, to make him bases, his Armour rusted: and thus disgracefully habilited, Prince Pericles with their con∣duct is gone to the Court of Symonides, where the Fisher men had fore-tolde him was all the preparation, that ey∣ther Art or Industrie might attaine vnto, to solemnize the birth day of faire Thaysa the good King Symonides daugh∣ter. This is the day, this Symonides Court, where the King himselfe, with the Princesse his daughter, haue placed themselues in a Gallery, to beholde the triumphes of seuerall Princes, who in honour of the Princes birth day, but more in hope to haue her loue, came purposely thither, to approoue their chiualrie. They thus seated, and Prince Pericles, as well as his owne prouiding, and the Fishermens care could furnish him, likewise came to the court. In this maner also 5. seuerall princes (their hor∣ses richly parasoned, but themselues more richly armed, their Pages before them bearing their Deuices on their shields) entred then the Tilting place. The first a prince
of Macedon, and the Deuice hée bore vpon his shield, was a blacke Ethiope reaching at the Sunne, the word, Lux tua vita mihi: which being by the knights Page deliuered to the Lady, and from her presented to the King her father, hée made playne to her the meaning of each imprese: and for this first, it was, that the Macedonian Prince loued her so well hée helde his life of her. The second, a Prince of Corinth, and the Deuice hée bare vpon his shield was a wreathe of Chiualry, the word, Me pompae prouexet apex, the desire of renowne drew him to this enterprise. The third of Antioch, and his Deuice was an armed Knight, being conquered by a Lady, the word, Pue pr dolcera qui per sforsa: more by lenitie than by force. The fourth of Sparta, and the Deuice he bare was a mans arme enui∣roned with a cloude, holding out golde thats by the touch∣stone tride, the word, Sic spectanda fides, so faith is to be looked into. The fift of Athens, and his Deuice was a flaming Torch turned downeward, the word, Qui me alit me extinguit, that which giues me life giues me death. The fixt and last was Pericles Prince of Tyre, who hauing nei∣ther Page to deliuer his shield, nor shield to deliuer, ma∣king his Deuice according to his fortunes, which was a withered Braunch being onely gréene at the top, which prooued the abating of his body, decayed not the noblenesse of his minde, his word, In hac spe viuo, In that hope I liue. Himselfe with a most gracefull curtesie presented it vnto her, which shée as curteously receiued, whilest the Péeres attending on the King forbare not to scoffe, both at his presence, and the present hée brought, being himselfe in a rusty Armour, the Caparison of his horse of plaine country russet, and his owne Bases but the skirtes of a poore Fishermans coate, which the King mildely reproo∣uing them for, hée tolde them, that as Uertue was not to be approoued by wordes, but by actions, so the out∣ward habite was the least table of the inward minde, and counselling them not to condemne ere they had cause to ac∣cuse:
They went forward to the triumph, in which no∣ble exercise they came almost all, as short of Pericles perfe∣ctions, as a body dying, of a life flourishing. To be short, both of Court and Commons, the praises of none were spoken of, but of the meane Knights (for by any o∣ther name he was yet vnknowne to any.) But the Tri∣umphes being ended, Pericles as chiefe, (for in this dayes honour hée was Champion) with all the other Princes, were by the Kings Marshall conducted into the Presence, where Symonides and his daughter Thaysa, with a most stately banquet stayed to giue them a thankefull intertain∣ment. At whose entraunce, the Lady first saluting Peri∣cles, gaue him a wreathe of Chiualry, welcommed him as her knight and guest, and crowned him King of that dayes noble enterprise. In the end, all being seated by the Marshall at a table, placed directly ouer-against where the king and his daughter sate as it were by some diuine operation, both King and daughter, at one instant were so strucke in loue with the noblenesse of his woorth, that they could not spare so much time to satisfie themselues with the delicacie of their viands, for talking of his pray∣ses: while Pericles on the other side obseruing the dignity wherein the King sate, that so many Princes came to ho∣nour him, so many Péeres stoode ready to attend him, hée was strucke with present sorrow, by remembring the losse of his owne. Which the good Symonides taking note of, and accusing himselfe before there was cause, that Peri∣cles spirites were dumpt into their melancholy, through some dislike of the slackenesse hée found in his entertaine∣ment, or neglect of his woorth, calling for a boule of wine, hée dranke to him, and so much further honoured him, that he made his daughter rise from her seate to beare it to him, and withall, willing her to demaund of him his name, Countrey, and fortunes, a message (gentle Lady) shée was as ready to obey vnto, as her Father was to com∣maund, reioycing that shée had any occasion offered her
whereby shée might speake vnto him. Pericles by this time hath pledged the King, and by his daughter (according to his request) thus returneth what hée is, that hée was a Gentleman of Tyre, his name Pericles, his education béene in Artes and Armes, who looking for aduentures in the world, was by the rough and vnconstant Seas, most vnfortunately bereft both of shippes and men, and after shipwrecke, throwen vpon that shoare. Which mis-haps of his the king vnderstanding of, hée was strucke with present pitty to him, and rising from his state, he came foorth with and imbraced him, bade him be chéered, and tolde him, that whatsoeuer misfortune had impayred him of, Fortune, by his helpe, could repayre to him, for both himselfe and Countrey should be his friendes, and pre∣sently calling for a goodly milke white Stéede, and a payre of golden spurres, them first hée bestowed vppon him, telling him, they were the prises due to his merite, and ordained for that dayes enterprise: which kingly cur∣tesie Pericles as thankefully accepting. Much time bée∣ing spent in dauncing and other reuells, the night béeing growne olde, the King commaunded the Knights shoulde be conducted to their lodgings, giuing order, that Peri∣cles Chamber should be next his owne, where wée will leaue them to take quiet rest, and returne backe to Tyre. The fift Chapter. How Helicanus heard newes of Antiochus and his daugh∣ters deaths, and of his sending of other Lords in search of their Prince Pericles. ANtiochus, who as before is discoursed, ha∣uing committed with his owne daughter so foule a sinne, shamed not in the same foule∣nesse to remaine in it with her, neither had shée that touch of grace, by repentaunce to
constraine him to abstinence, or by perswasion to deny his continuance: long, like those miserable serpents did their greatnesse flourish, who vse fairest shewes for fowlest e∣uills, till one day himselfe seated with her in a Charriot, made of the purest golde, attended by his péeres, and ga∣sed on by his people, both apparrelled all in Iewells, to out face suspition, and beget wonder (as if that glorious outsides were a wall could kéepe heauens eye from know∣ing our intents) in great magnificence rode they through Antioch: But sée the Iustice of the Highest, though sinne flatter, and man perseuere, yet surely Heauen at length dooth punish. For as thus they rode, gazing to be gazed vpon, and prowd to be accompted so, Uengeance with a deadly arrow drawne from foorth the quiuer of his wrath, prepared by lightning, and shot on by thunder, hitte, and strucke dead these prowd incestuous creatures where they sate, leauing their faces blasted, and their bodies such a contemptfull obiect on the earth, that all those eyes, but now with reuerence looked vpon them, all hands that ser∣ued them, and all knées adored them, scorned now to touch them, loathd now to looke vpon them, and disdained now to giue them buriall. Nay, such is heauens hate to these and such like sinnes, and such his indignation to his present euill, that twixt his stroke and death, hée lent not so much mercy to their liues, wherein they had time to crie out; Iustice, be mercifull, for we repent vs. They thus dead, thus contemned, and instéede of kingly monu∣ment for their bodies left, to be intoombed in the bowles of rauenous fowles, if fowles would eate on them. The strangenesse of their deaths were soone rumored ouer that part of the world, and as soone brought to the eares of He∣lycanus, who was a carefull watchman to haue know∣ledge of whatsoeuer hapned in Antioch, and by his know∣ledge to preuent what daunger might succeede, eyther to his Prince, or to his subiectes in his absence, of which tragedy he hauing notice, presently he imparted the news
thereof to his graue and familiar friend Lord Eschines, and now told him what till now hée had concealed, namely of their incest together, and that onely for the displeasure which princely Pericles feared Antiochus bore towardes him, and might extend to his people, by his knowledge thereof, hée thus long by his counsell had discontinued from his kingdome. Now it hapned that these tydings arriued to his eares, iust at the instant, when his graue counsell could no lon∣ger alay the head-strong multitude from their vnciuil and giddy muteny: and the reason of them (who most com∣monly are vnreasonable in their actions) to drawe them∣selues to this faction, was, that they supposed their prince was dead, and that being dead, the kingdome was left without a successefull inheritor, that they had bin onelie by Helicanus with vaine hope of Pericles returne, deluded, and that euen now the power being, by his death, in their hands, they would create to themselues a new soueraigne, and Helycanus should be the man. Many reasons hée vsed to perswade them, many Arguments to withstand them: nothing but this onely preuailed with them, that since he only knew their Prince was gone to trauell, and that, that trauell was vndertaken for their good, they would abstaine but for thrée months longer from bestowing that dignity which they calld their loue, though it was his dis∣like vpon him, and if by that time (which they with him should still hope for) the gods were not pleased for their perpetuall good to restore vnto them their absent Prince, hée then with all willingnesse would accept of their suffra∣ges. This then (though with much trouble) was at last by the whole multitude accepted, and for that time they were all pacified, when Helicanus assembling all the péeres vnto him, by the aduise of all, chose some from the rest, and after his best instructions, or rather by perswasions and graue counsell giuen, hée sent them to inquire of their Prince, who lately left at Pentapolis was highly honoured by good Symonides.
The sixt Chapter. How Prince Pericles is married to Thaysa king Symonides daughter, and how after he hath heard newes of Antio∣chus death, hee with his wife departeth toward his owne Country of Tyre. PRince Pericles hauing had (as before is mentioned) his lodging directed next ad∣ioyning to the kings bed-chamber, where∣as all the other Princes vppon their com∣ming to their lodgings betooke themselues to their pillowes, and to the nourishment of a quiet sléepe, he of the Gentlemen that attended him, (for it is to be noted, that vpon the grace that the king had bestowed on him, there was of his Officers toward him no attendance wanting) hée desired that hée might be left priuate, onely that for his instant solace they would plea∣sure him with some delightfull Instrument, with which, and his former practise hée intended to passe away the te∣diousnesse of the night insteade of more fitting slumbers. His wil was presently obeyed in all things since their ma∣ster had commaunded he should be disobeyed in nothing: the Instrument is brought him, and as hée had formerly wished, the Chamber is disfurnished of any other compa∣ny but himselfe, where presently hée beganne to compell such heauenly voyces from the sencelesse workemanship, as if Apollo himselfe had now béene fingering on it, and as if the whole Sinode of the gods, had placed their deities round about him of purpose, to haue beene delighted with his skill, and to haue giuen prayses to the excellencie of his art, nor was this sound only the rauisher of al hearers, but from his owne cléere breast hée sent such chéerefull notes, which by him were made vp so answerable to the others sound, that they séemed one onely consort of musike,
and had so much delicacie, and out of discordes making vp so excellent a coniunction, that they had had power to haue drawne backe an eare, halfe way within the graue to haue listned vnto it, for thus much by our story we are certaine of, that the good Symonides (being by the height of night, and the former dayes exercise, in the ripenesse of his con∣tentfull sléepe) hée reioyced to be awakend by it, and not accompting it a disease that troubled him in the hearing, but a pleasure wherewith hée still wished to be delighted. In briefe, hée was so satisfied to heare him thus expresse his excellence, that hée accompted his Court happy to en∣tertaine so worthy a guest, and himselfe more happy in his acquaintance. But day that hath still that soueraign∣tie to drawe backe the empire of the night, though a while shée in darkenesse vsurpe, brought the morning on, and while the king was studying with what aunswerable pre∣sent, wherewith to gratifie this noble Prince for his last nights musicke, a Gentlewoman (whose seruice was thither commaunded by his Daughter) brought him a Letter, whose in-side had a sute to him to this purpose. The Lady Thaysaes Letter to the King her Father. MY most noble Father, what my blushing modesty for∣bids me to speake, let your fatherly loue excuse that I write, I am subdude by loue, yet not inthralld through the li∣centiousnes of a loose desire, but made prisoner in that noble battell twixt Affection and Zeale: I haue no life but in this liberty, neither any liberty but in this thraldome, nor shall your tender selfe, weighing my affections truely in the Scale of your Iudgement, haue cause to contradict me, since him I loue hath as much merite in him, to challenge the title of a Sonne, as I blood of yours to inherite the name of a daugh∣ter,
then if you shall refuse to giue him me in marriage, de∣ny not I pray you to make ready for my funerall. Tis the stranger Pericles. Which request of hers, when the king her father had thus vnderstood of, hée beganne first to examine with him selfe, what vertue was in this choice, that should bind her thoughts to this liking, and what succéeding comfort hée might expect, the expectation of which, might inuite him to his consent. First hée beganne to remember him∣selfe, that he came vnto his Court but poore, and for po∣uerty, quoth the good king, tis a woorkemanship, that Nature makes vppe euen for others to contemne, and, which in these times, is growne odious to kéepe companie withall, that to marrie her which was his onely childe, and the expectation of his subiectes, with one of so lowe blood and meane discent, would returne, rather a disho∣nour than a dignitie to his name, since Parents rather expect the aduauncement of Titles, and the raising of their houses, in the vniting of their issue, than the de∣clining: but in the end, when hée had put all the Interiecti∣ons he could betwéen her loue and his liking, his vpright∣nesse made him sée, that in vertue consisted mans onely perfection, and in him, as her be fitting Court, she thought it fittest to kéepe her royall residence, and in that opinion allowing of his daughters choice, hée thought himselfe happy to liue Father to such a vertuous sonne, and his daughter more happy to be coupled to so noble a husband. And as hée was now thus contracting them together in his reioycing thoughts, euen in the instant came in Pe∣ricles, to giue his Grace that salutation which the morning required of him, when the king intending to dissemble that in shew, which hée had determined on in heart, hée first tolde him, that his daughter had that morning sent vnto
him that Letter, wherein shée intreated of him, that his Grace would be pleased, that himselfe (whom shée knew to call by no other name but the Stranger Pericles) might become her Schoolemaister, of whose rariety in musicke, excellencie in song, with comelinesse in dauncing, not onely shée had heard, but himselfe had borne testimonie to be the best, that euer their iudgements had had cause to iudge of. When Pericles, though willing to yéelde any courtesies to so gratious a Lady, and not disdaining to be commaunded any seruices by so good a Lord, yet replyed, Though all his abilities were at his Graces pleasure, yet he thought himselfe vnwoorthy to be his daughters schoole∣maister. I but quoth Symonides, shée will not be denied to be your Scholler, and for manifest proofe thereof héere is her owne Character, which to that purpose shée hath sent vnto vs, and we to that purpose giue you leaue to reade: which Pericles ouerlooking, and finding the whole tenour thereof to be, that his daughter from all the other Princes, nay from the whole worlde, sollicited him for her husband▪ he straitway rather coniectured it to be some subtiltie of the father to betray his life, than any constancy of the princesse to loue him: and foorthwith prostrating himselfe at the kings féete, hée desired that his Grace would no way séeke to staine the noblenesse of his minde, by any way séeking to intrappe the life of so harmelesse  Gentleman, or that with euill he would conclude so much good which he already had begunne toward him, protest∣ing, that for his part, his thoughts had neuer that am∣bition, so much as to ayme at the loue of his daughter, nor any action of his, gaue cause of his princely displesure: but the king faining still an angry brow, turned toward him, and tolde him, that like a traitour, hée lyed. Traytour, quoth Pericles? I, traytour, quoth the king, that thus disguised, art stolne into my Court, with the witchcraft  thy actions to bewitch, the yéelding spirit of my tender Childe. Which name of Traytor being againe  whic
Pericles then, insteade of humblenesse séemed not to forget his auntient courage, but boldely replyed, That were it any in his Court, except himselfe, durst call him traytor, euen in his bosome he would write the lie: affirming, that he came into his Court in search of honour, and not to be a rebell to his State, his bloud was yet vntainted, but with the heate, got by the wrong the king had offered him, and that he boldly durst, and did defie, himselfe, his sub∣iectes, and the prowdest danger, that eyther tyranny or treason could inflict vpon him. Which noblenesse of his, the king inwardly commending, though otherwise dis∣sembling, he answered, he should prooue it otherwise, since by his daughters hand, if there was euident, both his practise and her consent therein. Which wordes were no sooner vttered, but Thaysa (who euer since she sent her Fa∣ther her Letter, could not containe her selfe in any quiet, till she heard of his answer) came now in, as it had beene her parte, to make aunswere to her Fathers last sillable, when prince Pericles yéelding his body toward her, in most curteous manner demaunded of her by the hope she had of heauen, or the desire she had to haue her best wishes ful∣filled héere in the worlde, that shée would now satisfie, her now displeased Father, if euer he, by motion, or by let∣ters, by amorons glaunces, or by any meanes that Lo∣uers vse to compasse their disseignes, had sought to be a friend in the noblenesse of her thoughts, or a copartner in the worthinesse of her loue, when she as constant to fi∣nish, as she was forward to attempt, againe required of him, that suppose he had, who durst take offence there∣at, since that it was her pleasure to giue him to knowe that he had power to desire no more than she had willing∣nesse to performe? How minion, quoth her Father (taking her off at the very word, who dare be displeased withall?) Is this a fit match for you? a stragling Theseus borne we knowe not where, one that hath neither bloud nor merite for thée to hope for, or himselfe to challenge euen the least
allowaunce of thy perfections, when she humbling her princely knées before her Father, besought him to consi∣der, that suppose his birth were base (when his life she∣wed him not to be so) yet hée had vertue, which is the very ground of all nobilitie, enough to make him noble: she in∣treated him to remember that she was in loue, the power of which loue was not to be confined by the power of his will. And my most royall Father, quoth shée, what with my penne I haue in secret written vnto you, with my tongue now I openly confirme, which is, that I haue no life but in his loue, neither any being but in the enioy∣ing of his worth. But daughter (quoth Symonides) e∣qualles to equalls, good to good is ioyned, this not being so, the bauine of your minde in rashnesse kindled, must againe be quenched, or purchase our displeasure. And for you sir (speaking to prince Pericles) first learne to know, I banish you my Court, and yet scorning that our kingly in∣ragement should stoope so lowe, for that your ambition sir, Ile haue your life. Be constant, quoth Thaysa, for euerie droppe of blood hée sheades of yours, he shall draw an o∣ther from his onely childe. In briefe, the king continu∣ed still his rage, the Lady her constancie. While Pericles stoode amazed at both, till at last the Father being no lon∣ger able to subdue that which he desired as much as shee, catching them both rashly by the handes, as if hée meant strait to haue inforced them to imprisonment heclapt them hand in hand, while they as louingly ioyned lip to lip, and with tears trickling from his aged eyes, adopted him his happy sonne, and bade them liue together as man and wife. What ioy there was at this coupling, those that are Louers and enioy their wishes, can better conceiue, than my pen can set downe; the one reioycing to be made happy by so good and gentle a Lord, the other as happy to be inriched by so vertuous a Lady. What preparation there was for their marriage, is sufficiently expressed in this, that she was the onely daughter to a king, and had
her fathers liking in her loue: what spéede there was to that marriage, let those iudge who haue the thoughtes of Thaysa at this instant, only conceiue the solempnities at the Temple are doone, the feast in most solempne order fi∣nished, the day spent in musicke, dauncing, singing, and all Courtly communication, halfe of the night in maskes and other courtly shewes, and the other halfe in the hap∣py and lawfull imbracements of these most happy Louers. The discourse at large of the liberall Chalenges made and proclaimed, at Tilt, Barriers, running at the King▪ ioco di can, mannaging fierce horses, running on foote, and dauncing in armours, of the stately presented Playes, Shewes disguised, Spéeches, Maskes and Mummeries, with continuall harmony of all kindes of Musicke, with banquetting in all delicacie, I leaue to the consideration of them who haue behelde the like in Courtes, and at the wedding of princes rather than afford them to the descrip∣tion of my penne, only let such conceiue, all things in due order were accomplished, the dueties of marriage perfor∣med: and faire Thaysa this night is conceiued with child. The next day Ioy dwelling thorow the whole kingdom for this coniunction, euery man arose to feasting and iollity, for the wedding triumphs continued a whole mo∣neth, while Time with his feathered wings, sofanned a∣way the houres, and with his flippery féete, so glided ouer the dayes, that nine Moones had almost chaunged their light, ere halfe the time was thought to be expired, when it happened, that as the good Symonides and princely Peri∣cles with his faire Thaysa were walking in the garden ad∣ioyning to their pallace, one of the Lords, who (as before) were sent by graue and carefull Helycanus, in search of their absent Prince, came hastily in to them, who vppon his knée deliuered vnto the yoong Prince a Letter, which being opened the contents therein spake thus vnto him: That Antiochus and his daughter (as is before described) were with the violence of lightning (shot from heauen,)
strucke sodainely dead. And moreouer, that by she con∣sent of the generall doyces the Cittie of Antioch, with all the riches therein, and the whole kingdome were reserued for his possession and princely gouernment. Which Letter when he had read, he presently imparted the news there∣of to his kingly Father, who vppon view receiued, hée strait knew (what vntill then the modesty of Pericles had concealed) that his sonne whome from pouerty hée ad∣uanced to be the bedfellow of his daughter, was Prince of Tyre, who for the feare he had of Antiochus, had forsooke his kingdome, and now had giuen vnto him the kingdome of Antiochus for recompence, that graue Helycanus had not without much labour, appeased the stubborne mutiny of the Tyrians, who in his absence would haue elected him their king, and that to auoyde a future insurrection, his whole state) in safety, how necessary it was for him to make a spéedy returne, which gladnesse Symonides im∣cted to his Daughter, who as gladly receiued them. While Pericles intending a while to leaue his déerest déere behinde him, considering how dangerous it was for her to trauell by sea, being with childe, and so neere her time, he beganne to intreate of his kingly father of all necessarie prouision for his departure, since the safety of twoo king∣domes did importune so much: when on the other side Thaysa falling at her fathers féete, her teares speaking in her sute faster than her wordes, shée humbly requested, that as his reuerend age tendered her, or the prosperitie of the Infant wherewith shée thought her selfe happy to be imburthened, hée would not permitte her to remaine be∣hinde him. Which teares of hers preuayling with the a∣ged King, though compelling his teares to take a loth and sorrowfull departure of her. Their Shippes being strong∣ly appoynted, and fraught with all things conuenient as golde, siluer, apparrell, bedding, victualls, and armour, and fearing what too vnfortunately hapned, causing an aged Nurse called Lycorida a Midwife, with other hand∣maides
to attend her. They are shipt, and hée on shoare, the one gasing after the other with a gréedy desire, vntill the high vsurping waters tooke away the sight from them both. The seauenth Chapter. How faire Thaysa died in trauell of childe-birth vppon the Sea, and being throwen for buriall in the waters, was castashoare at Ephesus, and how by the excellent labour of Lord Cerimon a skilfull Physition, she was restored to her life againe, and by her owne request placed to liue a Votary in the Temple of Diana. PRince Pericles, with his Quéene Thaysa, being thus on shippe boorde, and their marriners merrily hauing hoysed vppe their sayles, their vessels, as prowde of such a fraught wherewith they were en∣riched, galloped chéerefully on the Oce∣an. Fortune did now séeme to looke fairely, neyther was there promise of any other alteration, the day looked loue∣ly, and the sea smiled for ioy, to haue her bosome pressed with these burthens: But nothing in this world that is permanent, Time is the father of Fortune, hée is slip∣pery, and then of necessitie must his childe be fickle: and this was his alteration, a cloude séemed to arise from forth the south, which being by the Maister and Marriners be∣held, they tolde Prince Pericles, that it was messenger of of a storme, which was no sooner spoken, but as if the heauens had conspired with the waters, and the windes bin assistant to both, they kept such a blustering, and such an vnruely stirre, that none could be heard to speake but themselues, seas of waters were receiued into their ships while others fought against them to expell them out, stop
the lecage there cries out one, hale vppe the maine bow∣lings there calles out another, and with their confusion (neither vnderstanding other, since the storme had gotte the maistery) they made such a hideous noyse, that it had had power to haue awakened Death, and to haue affrigh∣ted Patience: nor could it choose then but bring much ter∣ror to our sea-sicke Quéene, who had béene vsed to better attendance, than was now offered her by these ill tutored seruantes Winde and Water: but they who neither re∣spect birth nor blood, prayers nor threats, time nor occa∣sion, continued still their boysterous hauocke. With which stirre (good Lady) her eies and eares hauing not till then bin acquainted, she is strucke into such a hasty fright, that welladay she falles in trauell, is deliuered of a daugh∣ter, and in this childe birth dies, while her princely hus∣band being aboue the hatthes, is one while praying to heauen for her safe deliuerance, an other while suffering for the sorow wherwith he knew his Quéene was imbur∣thened, he chid the contrary storme (as if it had béen sen∣sible of hearing) to be so vnmanerly, in this vnfitting sea∣son, and when so good a Quéene was in labor, to kéep such a blustering: thus while the good Prince remayned reproo∣uing the one, and pittying the other, vp comes Lycorida the Nurse, sent along by good Symonides with his daugh∣ter, and into his armes deliuers his Sea-borne Babe, which he taking to kisse, and pittying it with these words: Poore inch of Nature (quoth he) thou arte as rudely wel∣come to the worlde, as euer Princesse Babe was, and hast as chiding a natiuitie, as fire, ayre, earth, and water can affoord thée, when, as if he had forgot himselfe, he ab∣ruptly breaks out: but say Licorida how doth my Quéene? O sir (quoth she) she hath now passed all daungers, and hath giuen vppe her griefes by ending her life. At which wordes, no tongue is able to expresse the tide of sorrowe that ouer-bounded Pericles, first looking on his Babe, and then crying out for the mother, pittying the one that had
lost her bringer ere shée had scarce saluted the worlde, la∣menting for himselfe that had béene bereft of so inestima∣ble a Iewell by the losse of his wife, in which sorrowe as he would haue procéeded, vppe came the Maister to him, who for that the storme continued still in his tempestuous height, brake off his sorrowe with these sillables. Sir, the necessitie of the time affoordes no delay, and we must intreate you to be contented, to haue the dead body of your Quéene throwne ouer-boorde. How varlet! quoth Peri∣cles, interrupting him, wouldest thou haue me cast that body into the sea for buriall, who being in misery receiued me into fauour? We must intreate you to temperance sir (quoth the Maister) as you respect your owne safety, or the prosperitie of that prety Babe in your armes. At the naming of which word Babe. Pericles looking mournfully vpon it, shooke his head, and wept. But the Maister going on, tolde him, that by long experience they had tri∣ed, that a shippe may not abide to carry a dead carcasse, nor would the lingering tempest cease while the dead body remayned with them. But the Prince séeking againe to perswade them, tolde them, that it was but the fondnes of their superstition to thinke so. Call it by what you shal please sir (quoth the Maister) but we that by long practise haue tried the proofe of it, if not with your graunt, then without your consent (for your owne safety, which wée with all duety tender) must so dispose of it. So calling for his seruants about him, he willed one of them, to bring him a chest, which he foorthwith caused to be well bitu∣med and well leaded for her coffin, then taking vp the bo∣dy of his (euen in death) faire Thaysa, he arrayed her in princely apparrell, placing a Crowne of golde vppon her head, with his owne hands, (not without store of fune∣rall teares) he layed her in that Toombe, then placed̄ hée also store of golde at her head, and great treasure of siluer at her féete, and hauing written this Letter which he layd vpon her breast, with fresh water flowing in his eyes, as
loath to leaue her sight, he nayled vp the Chest, the Te∣nor of which writing was in forme as followeth; If ere it hap this Chest be driuen On any shoare, on coast or hauen, I Pericles the Prince of Tyre, (That loosing her, lost all desire,) Intreate you giue her burying, Since she was daughter to a King: This golde I giue you as a fee, The Gods requite your charitie. The Chest then being nayled vp close, he commaunded it to be lifted ouer-boorde, and then naming his Childe Marina, for that she was borne vppon the Sea, he dire∣cted his Maister to alter the course from Tyre, (being a shorter cutte to Tharsus) and for whose safety he thither in∣tended, where with his hoste Cleon and Dionysa his wife, he intended to leaue his little infant, to be fostered and brought vp. The dead body being thus throwne ouer∣boorde, when as if Fortune had bethought her, that shée had wrought her vtmost spight to him, by bereauing him of so great a comfort, euen in the instant the tempest cea∣seth, where we will leaue Prince Pericles vppon calme waters, though not with a calme winde, sayling to Thar∣sus: and beholde, the next morning, by which time, the waues had rouled, from waue to waue this Chest to land, and cast it ashoare on the coast of Ephesus, in which Citty liued a Lord called Cerimon, who, though of noble bloud, and great possessions, yet was he so addicted to studie, & in searching out the excellencie of Arts, that his felicitie con∣sisted in contemplation, wisely fore-knowing, so icie is the state of riches, that it is thawed to nothing, by the least aduersitie, that carelesse heires may dispend, and riot consume them, when one vertue, and our deserued fame attendeth immortality, this consideration made him so to
apply his time in Letters, and in searching out the na∣ture of Simples, that he grew so excellent in the secret of Physicke, as if Apollo himselfe, or another Aesculapius had béene his Schoolemaister: nor was he of this plentie a niggard to the néedie, but so bountifull to the distressed, that his house and hand were accompted the hospitalls for the diseased. This Lord Cerimon had his residence built so neare the shoare, that in his windowes he ouer-looked the Sea: and being this morning in conference with some that came to him both for helpe for themselues, and reliefe for others; and some that were relating the crueltie of the last nights tempest on a sodayne casting his eye from foorth his casement towards the maine, he might espie the waters, as it were, playing with the Chest wherein the dead Quéene was incoffind, and which was vpon the so∣dayne, by a more eager billow, cast on his bankes, when presently thinking it to be the remnant of some shippe∣wracke, caused in the last nights storme, calling for his seruants, hée foorthwith commaunded them to haue it brought vppe to him as forseited vnto him, being cast on his ground, which accordingly performed, hée as pre∣sently gaue charge it should be opened, when not without much wonder he straitway viewed the dead body of the Quéene, so crowned, so royally apparelled, so intrea∣sured as before, and taking vp the writing which he like∣wise found placed vpon her breast, hée read it to the Gen∣tlemen, who at that time accompanied him, and know∣ing it thereby to be the dead Quéene to Prince Pericles. Now surely, quoth Pericles, thou hast a bodie euen drow∣ned with woe for the losse of so goodly a creature: for Gen∣tlemen, sayde he, as you may perceiue, such was the ex∣cellencie of her beauty, that grimme Death himselfe hath not power to suffer any deformitie to accompany it. Then laying his hand gently vpon her chéeke, he bethought him that life had not lost all the workemanshippe that Nature had bestowed vppon her, for euen at the opening of the
Chest, & as it were she then receiuing fresh aire, he might perceue, a new but calm glowing to recspire in her chéeks, with which being somewhat amazed. Now surely Gen∣tlemen, quoth hée turning to them, who were gréedily set round about him, this Quéene hath not long béene in∣traunced, and I haue read of some Egyptians, who af∣ter foure houres death, (if man may call it so) haue raised impouerished bodies, like to this, vnto their former health, nor can it be disparagement to me to vse my best practise on this Quéene, to which by the Gentlemen that accom∣panyed him, hée was incouraged to attempt, since that the recouery of her could not but appeare to be a worke of wonder, and since that his fortune was so successefull in his ministring, that all Fphesus was repleate with his helpe, so calling for a seruant of his to attend him with certayne boxes which he named were in his studie, as al∣so with fire and necessary linnen, inuoking Apollo to be gratious to his empericke, and the worke in hand, he be∣gan to apply to her, First pulling downe the clothes from off the Ladies bosome, he powred vppon her a most pre∣cious oyntment, and bestowing it abroad with his hand, perceiued some warmth in her breast, and that there was life in the body, whereat somewhat astonished, he felt her pulses, layde his chéeke to her mouth, and examining all other tokens that he could deuise, he perceiued how death stroue with life within her, and that the conflict was dan∣gerous, and doubtfull who should preuaile. Which bée∣ing done, he chased the body against the fire, vntill the bloud which was congealed with colde was wholly dissol∣ued, when powring a precious liquor into her mouth, hée perceiued warmth more & more to encrease in her, and the golden fringes of her eyes alitle to part: then calling softly to the Gentlemen who were witnesses about him, he bade them that they should commaund some still musicke to found. For certainely quoth he, I thinke this Quéene will liue, and suppose that she hath bin much abused, for
she hath not béene long intraunced, condemning them for rashnesse so hassily to throwe her ouer boorde. And when he had so said, he tooke the body reuerently into his armes, and bare it into his owne Chamber, and layed it vpon his bed groueling vpon the breast, then tooke hée certaine hote and comfortable oiles, and warming them vpon the coles, he dipped faire wooll therein, and fomented all the bodie ouer therewith, vntill such time as the congealed bloud and humours were thorowly resolued, and the spirites in due forme recouered their woonted course, the veines wa∣xed warme, the arteries beganne to beate, and the lungs drew in the fresh ayre againe, and being perfectly come to her selfe, lifting vp those now againe pricelesse diamonds of her eyes, O Lord (quoth shée) where am I? for it sée∣meth to me that I haue béene in a strange Countrey. And wheres my Lord I pray you? I long to speake with him. But Cerimon, who best knew, that now with any thing to discomfort her, might bréede a relapse, which would be vnrecouerable, intreated her to be chéered, for her Lord was well, and that anone, when the time was more fit∣ting, and that her decayed spirites were repayred, hée would gladly speake with her: So, as it were, being but newly awaked from death, to the great amasement of the beholders, she presently tell into a most comfortable slum∣ber, which Lord Cerimon giuing charge none should di∣sturbe her of, he in the meane time, and against she should awake, prouided cherishing meates, and as her strength grew, gaue wholesome clothes to refresh her with. But not long after, weakenesse being banished from her, and Cerimon, by communication knew, that shée came of the stocke of a King, he sent for many of his friendes to come vnto him, and adopted her for his owne daughter, and related vnto her, howe after so gréeuous a tempest, in what manner shée was found. In which tempest she sup∣posing her kingly husband to be shipwrecked, shée with many teares intreated, that since he had giuen her life, he
would be pleased to giue her leas to liue vnknowne to a∣ny man. To which Cerimon accorded: and for that intent placed her in the Temple of Diana, which was there con∣secrated at Ephesus. The eight Chapter. How Pericles arriuing at Tharsus, deliuereth his yoong daughter Marina vnto Cleon and Dyonysa to be foste∣red vp: and how Lycorida the Nurse lying vppon her death-bed, declareth vnto Marina who were her pa∣rents. HAuing thus left the recouered Thaysa a∣mongst the holy Nunnes in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, our Storie biddeth vs looke backe vnto sorrowfull Pericles, whose shippe with fortunate winde, fa∣uour of the heauens, and prouidence of his pylate, arriued at the shoare of Tharsus, where vpon his landing hée was curteously receiued by Cleon and Dy∣onysa; whome he as curteously saluted, telling them the heauie chaunces which had befallen him, both of the great stormes and tempests on the Sea, which he with patience had indured, as also of the death of the good Lady Thaysa, which he not without much sorrow suffered, onely quoth he, I haue héere left a little picture of her, who for it was giuen vnto me at Sea, I haue named Marina, and I thanke the heauens, is so like vnto her, that I neuer doe looke vppon it, but with much comfort, in whose prote∣ction and education I meane to vse your friendship, while I goe on in trauell to receiue the kingdome of Antiochus, which is reserued for mée. And if you will euer shew your gratitude, for my former charitie extended towardes you, and all this Citty in a former distresse, the gods haue gi∣uen
this cause, to prooue your thankefulnesse. When both vowing by solemne oath, their care should be on her, as reason vnto themselues, who is the guider of mans life: he satisfied with that their promise, thanked them, telling them moreouer, that with them also he woulde leaue Lycorida her mothers nurse, (and giuen vnto him by her good father Symomdes) that shée might be a nurse vn∣to her child, only further requesting them, and so charging Lycorida, that if it pleased the gods to lend her life to the yéeres of vnderstanding, they should not till his returne, make knowne vnto her, that she was a braunch sproong from him, but onely be brought vppe as the daughter of Cleon and Dyonysa, lest that the knowledge of her high birth, should make her growe prowd to their instructions. Of which hauing likewise promise, he deliuered the in∣fant and the nurse to Cleon, and therewithall, great sums of golde, siluer, and apparrell, and vowing solemnely by othe to himselfe, his head should grow vncisserd, his beard vntrimmed, himselfe in all vncomely, since he had lost his Quéene, and till he had married his daughter at ripe years. When they much wondring at so strange a resolue, and promising to be most faithfull with all diligence accor∣ding to his directions, Pericles tooke his leaue, departed with his Ship, sayling euen to the vttermost parts of all Egypt, while his yoong daughter Marina grew vp to more able discretion, and when she was fully attaind to 5. yéers of age, being to her selfe knowne no other but to be frée borne, she was set to Schoole with other frée children, al∣wayes ioyntly accompanied with one onely daughter that Dionysa had, being of the same time that she was of, where growing vp, aswel in learning, as in number of yéeres, vn∣till she came to the reckoning of fouretéene, one day when she returned from Schoole, she found Lycorida her Nurse sodainely fallen sicke, and sitting beside her vpon the bed, she as in care of her, demaunded the cause and manner of her sickenesse: when the Nurse finding her disease to haue
no hope of recouery, but a harbinger that came before to prepare a lodging for death, answered her to this purpose; For my sickenesse, queth she, it matters not (deare childe) since it is as necessary to be sicke, as it is néedefull to die, onely I intreate of you to hearken vnto a dying womans wordes that loueth you, and laying them vppe in your heart, perswade yeur selfe, that in these heures no sinner should, or can be so wretched, to spare a minute to finde time to lie. Knowe then, that you are not the daughter of Cleon and Dyonysa, as you till this haue supposed: but hearken vnto me, and I will declare vnto thée the begin∣ning of thy birth, that thou mayest knowe how to guide thy selfe after my death: Pericles the Prince of Tyre is thy father, and Thaysa king Symonides daughter was thy mo∣ther: which father and mother departed from thy grandsir at Pentapolis toward their kingdom of Tyre, thy mother be∣ing at Sea, fell in trauell with thée, & died after thou wert borne: when thy Father Pericles inclosed her body in a Chest with princely ornaments, laying twenty talents of golde at her head, and as much at her féete in siluer; with a Scedule written, containing the dignitie of her birth, & maner of her death, then caused he the Chest to be thrown ouer-boorde into the Sea, thorow a superstitious opinion which the mariners beléeued, leauing her body so inriched, to the intent, that whither soeuer it were driuen, they that found it, in regarde of the riches, would bury her accor∣ding to her estate. Thus Lady were you borne vppon the waters, and your fathers Ship with much wrestling of contrary windes, and with his vnspeakeable griefe of minde, arriued at this shoare, and brought thée in thy swadling clowtes vnto this Citty, where he with great care deliuered thée vnto this thine hoste Cleon and Dyony∣sa his wife, diligently to be fosterad vp, and left me héere also to attend vppon thée, swearing this oath to kéepe in∣uiolate, his haire should be vncisserd, his face vntrimmed, himselfe in all things vncomely continually to mourne for mother,
your dead mother, vntill your ripe yeares gaue him occa∣sion to marry you to some prince worthy your birth and beauty; wherefore I now admonish you, that if after my death, thine hoste or hostesse, whom thou calst thy parents, shall happly offer thée any iniury, or discurteously taking aduantage of thy absent father as vnbefitting thine estate intertain thée, haste thée into the market place, where thou shalt finde a Statue erected to thy father standing, take hold of it, and crie aloude; You cittizens of Tharsus; I am his daughter whose Image this is, who being mindefull of thy fathers benefits will doubtlesse reuenge thy iniurie. When Marina thanking Lycorida for making that known to her, which till then was vnknowne, and happly either thorow Time or Death might haue béene buried in her ig∣norance: and vowing, if euer néede should so require (of which as yet she had no cause to doubt) her counsell should be followed. And so Lycorida through sickenesse growing more weake, and Marina for this knowledge and aduise still tending on her, in her armes at last shée gaue vp the Ghost. The ninth Chapter. How after the death of Lycorida the Nnurse Dyonysa en∣uying at the beauty of Marina, hired a seruant of hers to haue murderd her, and how she was rescued by cer∣taine Pyrates, and by them carried to the Cittie of Meteline, where among other bondslaues, shee was solde to a common Bawde. MArina hauing thus by Lycoridaes meanes had knowledge of her parentes, and Ly∣corida hauing béene in her life, her most carefull Nurse, shée (not without iust cause) lamented her death, and caused
her body to be solempnely interred, in a field without the walles of the Cittie, raising a monument in remembrance of her, vowing to her selfe a yeares solemne sadnesse, and that her eies also for so long a time should daily pay their dewy offerings, as lamenting the losse of so good a friend. But this decrée of hers being accomplished, and all the rites thereof faithfully fulfilled, she dismissed her bodie of her mourning attire, and againe apparrelled her selfe as before, in her most costly habilliments, frequenting the Schooles, and diligently endeuouring the studies of the Liberall Sciences, wherein she so out-went in perfection, the labours of all that were studious with her, that shée was rather vsed amongst them as their Schoolemistris to instruct, than their fellow Scholler to learne, onely for her recreation betwixt the houres of study, dauncing, sing∣ing, sowing, or what experience soeuer (for in no action was she vnexpert, as also euery morning, and at noone, before she made her meale) she forgotte not to reuisite her Nurses sepulchre: and entring into the monument, vpon her knées she there offered her funerall teares for the losse of her mother, and desiring the gods in their holy Synode to protect the safety of her father, accusing her selfe as an vnfortunate childe, whose béeing, caused the death of her mother, so good a Quéene, and the sorrow of her father, so curteous a Prince: and in very déede, the whole course of her life was so affable and curteous, that she wonne the loue of all and euery man, accompting his tongue (the fa∣ther of spéech) a trewant, which was not liberall in her prayses: so that it fortuned as she passed along the stréete, with Dyonysa her daughter, who was her companion and Schoole-fellow, and who till then she supposed had béene her sister. The people, as at other times, came running out of their doores with gréedy desire to looke vpon her; and beholding the beauty and comelinesse of Marina so farre to out-shine Dyonysaes daughter, who went side by side with her, could not containe themselues from crying out,
Happy is that father who hath Marina to his daughter, but her Companion that goeth with her is fowle and ill∣fauoured. Which when Dyonysa heard, her enuy of those prayes bred in her a contempt, and that contempt soone transformed it selfe into wrath, all which shée for the in∣stant dissembling, yet at her comming home withdraw∣ing her selfe into a priuate walke, she in this maner with her selfe beganne to discourse; It is now quoth she, foure∣téene yéers since Pericles this out-shining gerles father de∣parted this our Citty, in all which time we haue not re∣ceiued so much as a Letter, to signifie that he remembers her, or or any other token, to manifest he hath a desire to acknowledge her, whereby I haue reason to coniecture, that he is either surely dead, or not regardes her, though I must confesse, at his departure from hence, and his com∣mitting her to our protection, he left her not vnfurnished of all things fitting the education of his childe, and a prin∣cesse of her birth, both of golde, plate, and apparrell, euen competent enough to foster her according to her degrée, nay (if néede were) to marry her according to her blood. But what of all this? he is absent, and Lycorida her Nurse is dead: Shée in beauty out-shines my childe, and I haue her fathers treasure in possession, (though giuen for her vse) shall make my daughter out-shine her. What though I knowe her father did reléeue our Citty? I agayne doe knowe, that but few in these dayes requite benefites with thankes, longer than while they are in receiuing. In briefe, I enuy her, and she shall perish for it. With the which wordes she had no sooner concluded, but in comes a seruant of hers, and she now intended to make him the diuells. With this Leonine she thus began to interprete her will: Leonine quoth she, thou knowst Marina. And ma∣dame, quoth he, for a most vertuous Gentlewoman. Talke not of vertue, quoth Dyonysa, for thats not the bu∣sinesse which we haue in hand; but I must haue thée learne to know her now, that thou mayest neuer know her after∣ward.
I vnderstand you not quoth Leonine. When she re∣plied, Take this at large then, Thou art my bond-slaue, whom I haue power to enfranchise or captiue, if thou wilt obey me, first then receiue this golde as the earnest which promiseth vnto thee a greater reward: but if thou deny to accomplish my desire, in bondage and imprisonment, I will fetter thée, and by no other meanes conclude my re∣uenge, but by thy death. Speake on my taske then good Madam, quoth Leonine, For what is it that a bondman will not attempt for liberty, which is déeter to man then life, and what not I then? Thou knowest, quoth Dyo∣nysa then, that Marina hath a custome, as soone as shée returneth home from schoole, not to eate meate before she haue gone to visite the sepulchre of her nurse. There at her next deuotion, doe thou méete her, stand ready, and with thy weapon drawen, sodainely kill her. Now kill her quoth Leonine, why tis an acte vnconscionable, & deserues dam∣nation but to conspire in thought, since she is a creature so harmlesse, that euen Innocencie it selfe cannot be more pure, nor inwardly be more decently arrayed than is her minde: yet to fulfill your pleasure, for the hope of golde, and the releasement of my bondage, were she as spotlesse as Trueth, héere are two monsters (drawing his swords into his hand) shall effect it for you, when she rewarding him with more golde, and commending his resolution, he goes forward to attend for her at Lycoridaes Toombe, and Marina being returned from Schoole, is also come thither to offer on the monument her diurnall deuotion, when on the sodaine, while her knées kissed the earth, and her eyes saluted heauen, while prayers were in her mouth, and teares in her eyes, all tributary offerings, giuen vnto the gods for the prosperitie of her father, on the sodaine to∣ward her, out rushed this Leonine, and with a looke as cruell as his heart, and spéech as harsh as his intent, he re∣solued her in blunt wordes, that he was come to kill her, that bée was hired vnto it by Dyonysa her foster mother,
that she was too good for men, and therefore he would send her to the gods, that if she would pray, pray, for hee had sworne to kill her, and he would kill her, and a thousand more, ere he would be damned for periury. When she that was on her knées before making her orisons to heauen, was now compelled to turne her intreaties to him: and first demaunded of him what offence her ignoraunce had done (for wittingly shée knew shee coulde doe done) ey∣ther to him. that (as himselfe said) came to murther her, or to her that hired him. But the villaine neyther regar∣ding her innocencie or teares, though showred in aboun∣daunce, but drawing out his sword wherewith to haue shed her blood, and haue damned his own soule, there were certaine pyrates that were newly put to water, in at a Creeke neare adioyning, where the villaine intended this most inhumane murther, and being come vp ashoare to forrage, for what pillage soeuer they could happen vpon, euen as he was about to haue giuen the fatall blow; whom all her intreaties could not perswade him from, beholding so bloudy a villaine, offering violence to so goodly a beau∣ty, they running all at once toward him cried out aloude; Holde monstrous wretch, as thou louest thy life, hold, for that Mayden is our prey, and not thy victory. Which when the villaine heard, and perceiuing his intent to be intercepted, making his héeles his best defence, till ha∣uing fledde some distance from them, and obseruing them not to pursue, he secretly stole backe, to note what the euent would be, which was, that the pyrates who had thus rescued Marina, carried her to their shippes, hoysed sayles, and departed. At which the vilaine returned home to his Mistris, declaring to her that he had doone what she commaunded him to doe, namely murthered Marina, and from the toppe of a high cliffe, throwne her body downe for buriall into the Sea, aduising her withall, that since it was done, the chiefest meanes to auoyde suspition, was, to put on mourning garments, and by counterfeiting a
great sorrow, in the sight of the people report, that she was dead of some daungerous disease: and withall, to blears the eies of the multitude (who with faire shewes are soone flattered) néere to her fathers Statue to erect a monu∣ment for her. According whereunto, she attyred her selfe and her daughter in solempne attire, and counterfeiting a fained sorrow, and dissembling teares. And going now to erect her monument (to the view of which, all the Cit∣tizens flocked) She in publike assembly thus spake vnto them. Déere Friends and Cittizens of Tharsus, If you shall happly wonder, why we thus vnwoontedly wéep and mourne in your sight, it is because the ioy of our eyes and staffe of our olde age Marina is dead, whose absence hath left vnto vs nothing but salt teares, and sorrowfull harts, as if by her death we were diuided from all comfort, yet haue we here taken order for her funeralls, and buried her (as héere you sée) according to her degrée, which losse of hers was right grieuous to all the people, nor was there any that was capable of sorrowe, but spent it for her, so that with one boyce and willing handes, they attended Dyonysa to the Market place whereas her fathers Image stoode, made of brasse, and erected also another to her with this Inscription: Marinaes Epitaph. The fairest, chastest, and most best lies heere, Who wythred in her spring of yeere: In Natures garden, though by growth a Bud, Shee was the chiefest flower, she was good. So with this flattery, (which is like a Skréene before the grauest Iudgements) deceiuing the Cittizens, and all doone, vnsuspected she returned home, when Cleon, who not at all consented to this treason, but so soone as he heard therof, being strucke into amazement, he apparelled himselfe in mourning garments, lamenting the vntime∣ly ruine of so goodly a Lady, saying to himselfe, Alas now,
what mischiefe am I wrapped in, what might I do or say héerein? The Father of that Uirgine deliuered this Citty from the perill of death, for this Citties sake hée suffered ship wracke, lost his goodes, and endured penury, and now he is requited with euill for good, his daughter which hée committed by my care to be brought vp, is now deuoured by the cruelty of my wife, so that I am depriued, as it were, of mine owne eyes, and forced to bewaile the death of that Innocent, she in whose presence, as in the fortune ef mine own posterity I should haue had delight. And then demaunding of Dyonysa how she could giue prince Pericles accompt of his childe, hauing robbed him of his childe, how she could appease the fury of his wrath, if her acte were knowne to him? or how alay the displeasure of the gods, from whome nothing can be hid. For Pericles quoth she, if such a pious innocent as your selfe do not reueale it vnto him, how should he come to the knowledge thereof, since that the whole Citty is satisfied by the monument I caused to be erected, and by our dissembling outside, that she died naturally, and for the gods, let them that list be of the minde to thinke they can make stones speake, and raise them vp in euidence, for my parte I haue my wish, I haue my safety, and feare no daunger till it fall vpon me. But Cleon rather cursing then commending this ob∣duracy in her, he continued mourning vnfainedly, but she according to her sinful condition. By this time the pirats (who before rescued Marina, when she should haue béene slaine by trecherous Leonine) are now ariued at Meteline, and in the Market place of the Cittie, according to the cu∣stome, amongst other bondslaues, offered her to be solde, whither all sorts of people, comming to supply their pur∣poses, Marina was net without much commendations gazed vpon of the buyers, some commending her beauty, others her sober countenaunce, all pittying her mishap, and praysing her perfections, which prayses of her, were so spread through the Citty, that from all parts they came
crowding to sée her, amongst the number of which, was a Leno or awde, yet one who had not set vp shop▪ and kept trade for himselfe, but was yet but iourney-man to the deuill. This Leon amongst others, staring vpon her, and knowing her face to be a fit faire▪ signe for his maisters house, and with which signe he made no doubt, but to lodge vnder their roofe, all th' intemperate (euen from youth to age) thorow the whole Citty, hée foorth with demaun∣ded the price, intending to buy her, at what rate soeuer, and in the end, went thorow, and bargained to haue her, paying a hundred Sestercies of golde, and so presently hauing giuen earnest, he takes Marina, and the rest of the Pirates home with him to his Maisters house, Marina was there to be taught how to giue her body vppe a prosti∣tute to sinne, and the Pirates for their new stuffe to re∣ceiue their money. The tenth Chapter. How Marina being thus solde to a Bawde, preserued her virginitie, and how shee conuerted all that euer came to make hire of her beauty from the loosenesse of their desires. MArina was no sooner thus concluded for, by the hée Bawde, but the Pyrates were as soone brought home to his masters house, and receiued their payment, when after their departure, she giuing commaund to the Pander her man, that he should goe backe into the Market place, and there with open crie proclaime, what a picture of Nature they had at home, for euery lasciuious eie to gaze vpon. The she Bawd beganne to instruct her, with what complement she should enter∣taine her customers: she first asked her, if she were a vir∣gine.
When Marina replyed, she thanked the Gods, shée neuer knew what it was to be otherwise. In so being quoth the she bawde, you haue béene well: but now in plaine tearmes I must teach you how to be worse. It is not goodnesse in you (quoth Marina) to teach me to be so: for goodnes answerd the bawd, it is a Lecture, such as we vse seldome, & our consciences neuer reade one to another, & therefore attend vnto me: you must now be like a stake for euery man to shoote at, you must be like a foord that must receiue all waters, you must haue the benefite of all nati∣ons, and séeme to take delight in all men. I thanke my starres, answered Marina, I am displeased with none: for by this answere it appeared such was the puritie of her minde, that she vnderstoode not what this deuills sollici∣tor pleaded vnto her: but she quickely taking her off, told in more immodest phrase, that shée had payde for her, and that she and all her body was hers, that will ye nill ye she must now be what she her selfe had béene (and there is sel∣dome any bawde, but before time, hath béene a whoore) that to conclude, shée had bought her like a beast, and shée meant to hire her out. When she vnderstanding vnwillingly what all these wordes tended vnto, she fell prostrate at her féete, and with teares showred downe in aboundaunce, she intrea∣ted her, not to make hire of her bodie to so diseasefull a vse, which shée hoped the gods had ordained to a more happy purpose. When the bawde answered her, Come, come, these droppes auaile thée not, thou arte now mine, and I will make my best of thée: and I must now learne you to know, we whom the worlde calles Bawdes, but more properly are to be stiled Factors for men, are in this like the hangman, neither to regard prayers, nor teares, but our owne profite. So calling for her slaue, which was gouernour ouer her she-houshold, this was her appoynt∣ment vnto him, Goe quoth shée and take this Mayden, as shée is thus decked in costly apparrel (for it is to be re∣membred,
that the former Pirates had no way dispoyled her of her ornaments, with purpose to prise her at the higher rate) and leading her along, this be the crie tho∣row the whole Citty, That whosoeuer desireth the pur∣chase of so wondrous a beauty, shall for his first enioying her, pay tenne péeces of golde, and that afterward shée shall be common vnto the people for one péece at a time. Which will of hers, Marina being no way able to resist, but with her sorrowe, onely desiring of the good gods, to be protectors of her chastitie: She with this her slaue was hurried along, and who with the tenour of his priapine proclamation, had so awaked the intemperaunce of the whole Cittie, that against her returne, of high and low there was a full corwding at the doore, euery man carry∣ing his money in his hand, and thinking him the happi∣est man that might first haue accesse. But heauen who is still a protector of Uertue against Uice, ordayned this for Marina, that the sending her abroad, with purpose, first to shew her, and after, to make sale of her to the worlde, was the onely meanes to defend her in the state of her vir∣ginitie. For as she was (as before is saide) led along, and thousands of people wondring about her, and flocking as it had béene so many flies, to infect so delicate a preserua∣tiue, it happened that Lysimachus the chéefe gouernour of Meteline, looking out at his windowe, to obserue what strange occasion drew the giddy hauocke of people, to mu∣ster themselues into such throngs: he, not without great admiration obserued, that it was to make boote of so pre∣tious a beauty, whose inflaming colours which Nature had with her best Arte placed vppon her face, compelled him to censure, that she was rather a deseruing bedfel∣low for a Prince, than a play-fellow for so rascally an as∣sembly: so pittying a while her misfortune, that it was so hard, to be throwne into the iaws of two such poisonous and deuouring serpents, a Pandar, and a Bawde, yet at last, being inflamed with alittle sinnefull concupiscence,
by the power of her face, he resolued himselfe▪ that since shée must fall, it were farre more fitter, into his owne armes, whose authoritie could stretch to doe▪ her good, than into the hote imbracements of many, to her vtter ruine; so presently dismissing away a seruant of his, he gaue him charge, to giue in charge to the Bawd, that at the returne home, of this new péece of merchandise of hers, as shée respected, or in time of néede would be beholding to his sauour, (and Heauens forfend but Bawdes nowe and then should stand in néede of authoritie) she should keepe her priuate from the conference of any, for hee himselfe that night late in the euening, in secret, and in some disguise, would (for her guests sake) visite her house. There néeded no further incouragement to bid the Bawde stirre vp her damnable limbes to make all fit. It was e∣nough in this, that the Gouernour had sent worde, it was he that was to come. But hauing giuen the best gar∣nish she could to her sinnefull habitation: and Marina be∣ing returned home againe by the Pandar, who had ledde her vp and downe as Beare heards leade beares, for shew first, and to be baited after: Shée tooke her vp with her into a priuate Chamber, when the fruite of her instructi∣ons were, how she should now learne to behaue her selfe, for she had fortunes comming vppon her, she was nowe to be receiued, respected, and regarded of a man that was honourable. Heauen graunt that I may finde him so, quoth Marina. Thou needest not doubt it sweete heart, quoth the Bawde, for though I tell it thée in priuate, which for a million he would not haue to be knowne pub∣likely: Hée is no woorse a man thou arte shortly to deale withall, than the Gouernour of this whole Citty, a Gentleman that is curteous, a fauourer of our calling, one that will as soone haue his hand in his pocket, as such a pretty dilling as thou shalt come in his eye, and not as most of our Gentlemen doe, drawe it out empty, but fil∣ling it full of golde, will most loue-like rayne it downe in∣to
his Danaes lap. In briefe, he is a Nobleman, and, which is a thing which we respect more than his nobilitie, he is liberall: he is curteous, and thou mayest commaund him, he is vertuous and thou mayest learne of him. All these indéede, answered Marina, are properties, due vnto so worthy a Gentleman, whom you picture him to be: and if he be liberall in good, I shall be glad to taste of his boun∣tie: if curteous, I shall as willingly become his seruant: and if vertuous, it shal be in me no way to make him vici∣ous. Well, well, well, sayes the Bawde, we must haue no more of this puling, and I must haue you learne to know, that vice is as hereditary to our house, as the olde barne to your countrey beggar. But as shée would haue proceeded with more of these her diuelish counsells, hasti∣ly into the Chamber came the Pandar vnto them, who as hote as a toste, with his haste to bring the newes he told, them, that the Lorde Lysimachus was come, and as if the word Come had béene his kew, he entred the Chamber with the master bawde, when the whole frie of sinners cursying about him, he very largely, as the Prologue to his entertainment, distributed golde among them, and then as roundly demaunded, for that same fresh péece of stuffe, which by their proclamation they tolde, they had now to make sale of, and be of set purpose was come to haue a sight of. When they all poynting toward Marina, told him there shée was, and for our selues, quoth they, we hauing done the office of right Chamberlaines, brought you together, we will shut the doore after vs, and so leaue you. Who no sooner departed, but Lysimachus the Gouernour began to demaund of her the performaunce of that for which he came. When shée prostrating her selfe at his féete, intrea∣ted him to take pitty of her, and from poynt to poynt (ex∣cepting her birth, and death of her parents) discoursed vnto him the whole story of her misfortunes: as that by the practise of Dyonysa, and cruelty of Leonine, she should
haue béene murthered. And how it pleased the Gods to rescue her from that ruine by certaine Pyrates, who after solde her to this brothell, where, most vnhappy, he was witnesse she remayned. Then gentle Sir, quoth shée, since heauen hath béen so gratious, to restore me from death, let not their good to me, be a meanes for you, to be author of my more misfortune. But the Gouernour suspecting these teares, but to be some new cunning, which her matron the Bawde had instructed her in, to drawe him to a more large expence: He as fréely tolde her so, and now beganne to be more rough with her, vrging her, that he was the Gouernour, whose authoritie coulde wincke at those ble∣mishes, her selfe, and that sinnefull house could cast vppon her, or his displeasure punish at his owne pleasure, which displeasure of mine, thy beauty shall not priuiledge thée from, nor my affection, which hath drawen me vnto this place abate, if thou with further lingering withstand me. By which wordes, she vnderstanding him to be as confi∣dent in euill, as she was constant in good, she intreated him but to be heard, and thus she beganne. If as you say (my Lorde) you are the Gouernour, let not your authoritie, which should teach you to rule others, be the meanes to make you mis-gouerne your selfe: If the eminence of your place came vnto you by discent, and the royalty of your blood, let not your life prooue your birth a bastard: If it were throwne vpon you by opinion, make good, that opinion was the cause to make you great. What reason is there in your Iustice, who hath power ouer all, to vndoe any? If you take from mée mine honour, you are like him, that makes a gappe into forbidden ground, after whome too many enter, and you are guiltie of all their euilles: my life is yet vnspotted, my chastitie vnstai∣ned in thought. Then if your violence deface this build∣ing, the workemanship of heauen, made vp for good, and not to be the exercise of sinnes intemperaunce, you do kill your owne honour, abuse your owne iustice, and impo∣uerish
me. Why quoth Lysimachus, this house wherein thou liuest, is euen the receptacle of all mens sinn es, and nurse of wickednesse, and how canst thou then be other∣wise then naught, that liuest in it? It is not good, answe∣red Marina, when you that are the Gouernour, who should liue well, the better to be bolde to punish euill, doe knowe that there is such a roofe, and yet come vnder it. Is there a necessitie (my yet good Lord) if there be fire be∣fore me, that I must strait then thither flie and burne my selfe? Or if suppose this house, (which too too many féele such houses are) should be the Doctors patrimony, and Surgeons feeding; folowes it therefore, that I must néeds infect my self to giue them maintenance? O my good Lord, kill me, but not deflower me, punish me how you please, so you spare my chastitie, and since it is all the dowry that both the Gods haue giuen, and men haue left to me, do not you take it from me; make me your seruant, I will wil∣lingly obey you; make mée your bond woman, I will ac∣compt it fréedome; let me be the worst that is called vile, so I may still liue honest, I am content: or if you thinke it is too blessed a happinesse to haue me so, let me euen now, now in this minute die, and Ile accompt my death more happy than my birth. With which wordes (being spoken vpon her knées) while her eyes were the glasses that carried the water of her mis-hap, the good Gentlewo∣man being mooued, hee lift her vp with his hands, and e∣uen then imbraced her in his hart, saying aside▪ Now sure∣ly this is Uirtues image, or rather, Uertues selfe, sent downe from heauen, a while to raigne on earth, to teach vs what we should be. So in steede of willing her to drie her eyes, he wiped the wet himselfe eff, and could haue found in his heart, with modest thoughts to haue kissed her, but that hée feared the offer would offend her. This onely hée sayde, Lady, for such your vertues are, a farre more worthy stile your beuty challenges, and no way lesse your beauty can promise me that you are, I hither came
with thoughtes intemperale, soule and deformed, the which your paines so well hath laued, that they are now white, continue still to all so, and for my parte, who hi∣ther came but to haue payd the price, a péece of golde for your virginitie, now giue you twenty to reléeue your ho∣nesty. It shall become you still to be euen as you are, a peece of goodnesse, the best wrought vppe, that euer Na∣ture made, and if that any shall inforce you ill, if you but send to me, I am your friend. With which promise, lea∣uing her presence, she most humbly thanked the Gods for the preseruation of her chastitie, and the reformation of his mind. Lysimachus though departed, thus intended not to leaue her so, but with diligent eyes to attend, how shée beha∣ued her selfe to all other, who should haue admittance to her, and for that purpose, hauing power to commaund the Bawde, hée placed himselfe in the next Chamber, where he might heare, euen to a sillable, whatsoere passed, where he was no sooner setled with a former charge giuen to the bawd, that any man should haue accesse to her, but by turnes, he heard she had also won others, and preserued herselfe from them, as she had formerly done against him, gaining tenne times as much of profite by her prayers and teares, as she should haue doone by prostituting her beau∣ty to their willes: at last, all of them being departed, and the house vnfrequented, onely of their owne householde, and of the Gouernour, the bawde standing ready at the doore, as hée should goe out, making his obeysaunce vn∣to him as hée should returne, in hope of his fée or rewarde, hée with an angry brow turned towards him, saying, Uil∣laine, thou hast a house héere, the weight of whose sinne would sincke the foundation, euen vnto hell, did not the vertue of one that is lodged therein, kéepe it standing; and so, as it were inraged, giuing them nothing, he depar∣ted. By which displeasure of his, the whole swarme of bawdes (as truely it was) ghessed, that their new te∣naunt,
had not béene pliant to his will: and all rushing in hastily vppon her, first taking away the golde which the charitie (and not iniury of all who had beene there) had giuen her to reléeue her with, they cried against her, they should be all vndoone by her, their house would grow vn∣customed, and their trading would fall to decay, by her squeamishnesse, and want of familiaritie to their Clients, resoluing now, that there was no way to bring her vnto their bowe, but by hauing her rauished. For it is to be noted, not any that parted the house besides Lysimachus, but euen as he did, so they in like manner rayled against them, so forcibly had hir perswasions preuailed with them: whereupon, for that purpose they gaue her vp to the Pan∣dar, who first agréed for her, saying; That he that had bargained for the whole ioynt, it was fittest for him to cut a morsell from off the spit. So leauing them together, and telling him, they gaue her vp to his power, to doe euen what he would with her: the man and wife (though both bawdes) departed, when the pandar going to her, tolde her, that he, his master, nor their antient family would as thus long they had béene, be vndoone by ere a Puritane péece of them all. And therefore quoth he; Come on and resolue your selfe without more whining, for I am but the bawdes seruant. The bawde hath commaunded me, and euery seruant by the Indenture of his dnety, is bound to obey his master: So catching her rashly by the hand, as he would haue inforced her to his will; she first calling on Diana patronesse of Chastitie to defend her, fell likewise downe at his féete, and besought him but to heare her: which being graunted, she demaunded of him what thing he could wish himselfe to be, which was more vile than he was, or more hatefull than he would make himselfe to be? Why my master or my mistris (quoth the villaine) I thinke, who haue all the sinnes subiect to mankind raign∣ing in them, and are (indéede) as bad as the Diuell him∣selfe: yet (quoth Marina) thou goest about to be worse then
they, and to doe an office at their setting on, which thy ma∣ster himselfe hath more pitty then to attempt, to robbe me of mine honour, which in spite of them and thée, the Gods (who I hope will protect it still) haue till this breathing protected, to leprous my chast thoghts, with remembrance of so foule a déede, which thou then shalt haue doone, to damne thine owne soule, by vndooing of mine. At which word, the Uillaine being strucke into some remorce, and standing in a pawse, Marina went forward, and tolde him; If thou wantest golde, there is some for thée (part of that she had reserued which before was giuen hir, from the bawdes knowledge:) or if thou wantest maintenaunce, prouide mée but some residence in an honest house, and I haue experience in many things which shall labour for thee, as namely, I am skilfull in the seauen Liberall Sci∣ences, well exercised in all studies, and dare approoue this, that my skill in singing and playing on Instruments ex∣céeds any in the citty: therefore (quoth she) as thou before didst proclame my beuty in the market to the open world, whereby to haue made me a common prostitute, so now a∣gayne proclame my vertues vnto them, and I doubt not but this honorable citty will affoord schollers sufficient, the instructing of whome will returne profite enough, both to repay the Maister what hée payed out for me, prouide an honester course for thée then this thou liuest in, and giue a quiet content vnto my selfe. Sooth (quoth the Uillaine) being now mooued vnto much more compassion of her; If you haue (as you say) these qualities, I will labour with my Master, and doe my best for your release. If not (an∣swered Marina, I giue thée frée leaue to bring me backe a∣gaine, and prostitute me to that course which was first pretended for me. In briefe, the Uillaine so laboured with the bawde his maister, that though hée woulde not giue her leaue to depart his house, yet in hope of the pro∣fit, which would come in by her other qualities, she should stay in his house, and none, with her former gréeuances
disturbe her, and withall, charged the Pander, to set vp a Bill in the Market place, of her excellencie in speaking, and in singing. At the report of which there crowded as many to the bawdes great profite to be delighted with her woorth, as there came before to haue made spoyle of her vertue, and not any man but gaue her money largely, and departed contented, onely aboue the rest the Lorde Lysi∣machus had euermore an especiall regarde in the preserua∣tion of her safety no otherwise than if she had béene descen∣daed from himselfe, and rewarded the villaine very libe∣rally for the diligent care hée had ouer her. The elouenth Chapter. How Pericles after foureteene yeeres absence, arriued at Tharsus, and not finding his daughter, lamented her supposed death: and how taking ship againe, he was by crosse windes driuen to Meteline, where his daugh∣ter Marina was: and how by the meanes of Prince Lysimachus comming aboorde his shippe to comforte him, he came to the knowledge of his lost daughter, and also of his wife Thaysa. HAuing thus preserued Marina, our Story giues vs now leaue to returne againe to Prince Pericles, who after fouretéene yeares absence arriued at Tharsus, and was receiued into the house of Cleon and Dyonysa, with whome hée had left his yoong daughter Marina to be fostered vp. At the newes of whose comming, Cleon and Dyonysa againe apparrelled themselues in mournfull habites, went out to méete him: who when Pericles beheld in so sad an out-side; My tru∣sty friends, what cause inforceth you to giue so sad a wel∣come to my entertainement? O my good Lord, answered Dyonysa, would any tongue but ours might be the herald
of your mis-hap: but sorrowes pipes will burst, haue they not vent, and you of force must knowe Marina is dead. Which when Pericles heard, the very word Death séemed like an edge that cut his heart, his flesh trembled, and his strength failed: yet in that agony a long time standing a∣mased, with his eyes intentiuely fixed on the ground, and at length recouering himselfe, and taking breath, hée first cast his eyes vppe to heauen, saying; O you Gods! extreamity of passion dooth make mée almost ready to ac∣cuse you of iniustice. And then throwing his eyes gréedi∣ly vpon her. But woman, quoth hée, If (as thou sayest) my most déere Marina be dead, is the money and the trea∣sure which I also left with you for her, perished with her? When she aunswered; Some is, and some yet remaineth. And as for your daughter (my Lord) lest you shoulde anie way suspect vs, we haue sufficient witnesse: for our Ci∣tizens being mindefull of your benefites bestowed vppon them, haue erected vnto her a monument of brasse fast by yours. And when she had so said, she brought foorth such money, iewells, and apparrell as it pleased her to say were remayning of Marinaes store. Wherevppon Pericles gi∣uing credite to this report of her death, he commaunded his seruants to take vp what she had brought, and beare them to his shippes, while he himselfe would goe visite his daughters monument. Which when he beheld, and had read the Epitaph, as before written, his affection brake out into his eies, and he expressed more actuall sor∣row for the losse of her then Inditement can expresse: first, tumbling himselfe vppon her monument, he then fell into a swownd, as if, since he might not leaue all his life with her, yet he would leaue halfe at least, from which trance being at the length recouered, hée apparrelles himselfe in sacke-cloth, running hastily vnto his shippes, desireth the Sea to take him into their wombe, since neither land nor water was fortunate vnto him; for the one had bereft him of a daughter, the other of a wife. But as befitted
thē, being most careful of his safty, they vsed their best per∣swasions, to asswage this tempest of his sorrow; present∣ly, as much as might be in such a case, they preuayled, and partly by time, which is a curer of all caes, continu∣ally mittigated some part of the griefe. When hée percei∣uing the winde to stand fitte for their departure, hee hoy∣sed vppe sailes, and gaue farewel to the shoare, nor had they long sailed in their course, but the winde came about into a contrary quarter, and blew so fiercely that it trou∣bled both sea and shippes, the raine fell fiercely from a∣boue, and the sea wrought woonderously vnderneath, so that the tempest being terrible for the time, it was in that extreamitie thought fittest to strike sayle, to let the Helme goe, and to suffer the shippe to driue with the tide, whi∣ther it would please the gods to direct it: But as Ioy euer∣more succéedeth Heauinesse, so was this sharpe storme occasion of a ioyful méeting, betwixt this sorrowful father, and his lost daughter; for while Prince Pericles shippe is thus gouerned at randon, by fortune it striketh vppon the shoare of the Cittie Meteline, where now Marina remai∣ned, of whose death he (as before) being fully perswaded, in whose life he had hope his decayed comfortes should a∣gaine haue had new growth. And being now agayne at sea, he vowed to himselfe neuer more to haue fellowshippe or conference with any man, charging all his folowers, of whome Helycanus was one, that none of them vpon the paine of his displeasure (and who is ignorant that the dis∣pleasure of kings is as daungerous as death) should dare to speake vnto him: no not so much as they who attended him with meate, and withall commaunded them, that they should not ordayne for him any more but so small a competence, as might euen scarcely maintaine nature, accompting now that life which he possessed, tedious to him, and wishing death in the most vnfriendly languish∣ment. In which state while he consisted, pining of his bo∣dy, and perplexed in minde, it happened, that at one selfe
same time Lord Helycanus going from the Princes shippe, and landing on the shoare, the Gouernour Lysimachus, who (as before is mentioned) tenderd Marina, was stan∣ding at the hauen, and noting Pericles ships riding there at anker, he beganne with himselfe to commend the come∣linesse of the vessells, and applaude the state they vphelde in their burthens, and in especially, that of the Admirall wherein the Prince himselfe was, who seeing Helycanus come on shoare, and his graue and reuerent countenaunce promising him, to be a father of experience, and worthy of his conference, hee in curteous manner saluted him, and demaunded of him, of whence those shippes were, for sir quoth he, by their armes and ensignes I perceiue they are strangers to our harbours, as also that it would please him to deliuer to him who was the owner of them, when He∣lycanus, as in the whole Storie, discoursed vnto him his misfortunes, as also of his former woorth, and his pre∣sent languishment, from which he could not be remooued, neither by his owne wisedome, nor by the counsell of his friends. When Lysimachus pittying his ruins, intreated Helycanus that he might speake with him, whereby to try if his perswasions had power to preuayle with him more then the will of himselfe, or power of his subiects. Which being by Helycanus graunted, he foorthwith conducted him downe where his Maister lay: whom when Lysima∣chus beheld, so attired from the ordinary habite of other men, as with a long ouer-growne beard, diffused hayre, vndecent nayles on his fingers, and himselfe lying vppon his cowch groueling on his face. He somewhat astonished at the strangenes thereof, caled vnto him with a soft voice, Prince Pericles, who hearing himselfe named, and thin∣king it to be some of his men, that called vpon him contra∣ry to his cemmaundement, hée arose vp sodainely with a fierce countenaunce: but seeing him to be a stranger, verie comely and honourably attyred, hee shruncke himselfe downe vppon his pillow, and held his peace. When Ly∣simachus
demaunded of Helycanus if it were his custome to be so silent to all men. Sir, it is quoth he, and hath con∣tinued so for the space of this moneth, neither dare any of vs his subiects, though we suffer much sorrow for him, by our perswasions séeke to alter him. Now surely quoth Ly∣simachus, though his misfortunes haue beene great, and by which he hath great cause for this sorrow, it is great pitty he should continue thus peruerse and obstinate, or so noble a gentleman come to so dishonorable a death: and thereuppon bethinking with himselfe what honourable meanes he might vse to recouer him. He sodainely re∣membring the wisedom that he had known Marina had in perswasion: and hauing heard since of her excellent skill in musicke, singing and dauncing: he by the consent of Helycanus caused her to be sent for, resoluing with him∣selfe, that if the excellencie of her ministry had no power to worke on him, all phisicke was in vaine, and he from thence would resigne him ouer to his graue. The messen∣ger spéedily is returned, bringing Marina along with him: whome when Lysimachus beheld, Marina quoth he, let me request of thée, thy help and vttermost knowledge in com∣forting the owner of this shippe which lieth in darkenesse, and will receiue no comfort, nor come abroade into the light, for the sorrow that he conceiueth through the losse of a wife and a daughter. From which if thou recouer him, and to his former health restore him, I will, as I am a Gentleman, giue thée in recompence thirtie sistercies of golde, and as many of siluer, and though the bawd hath bought thée, according to the laws of our citty, from whom no authoritie can compell thée, yet for thirtie dayes will I redéeme thée. Which when Marina heard, shée went boldely downe into the cabine to him, and with a milde voyce saluted him, saying; God saue you sir, and be of good comfort, for an innocent Uirgin, whose life hath bin distressed by shipwrack, and her chastity by dishonesty, and hath yet bin preserued from both, thus curteously saluteth
thée: but perceuing him to yéeld her no answer, she began to record in verses, and therewithall to sing so sweetely, that Pericles, notwithstanding his great sorrow, woonde∣red at her, at last, taking vp another instrument vnto his eares she preferred this. Amongst the harlots foule I walke, Yet harlot none am I; The Rose amongst the Thornes doth grow, And is not hurt thereby. The Thiefe that stole me sure I thinke, Is slaine before this time. A Bawde me bought, yet am I not Defilde by fleshly crime: Nothing were pleasanter to me, Then parents mine to know. I am the issue of a King, My blood from Kings dooth flowe: In time the heauens may mend my state, And send a better day, For sorrow addes vnto our griefes, But helps not any way: Shew gladnesse in your countenaunce, Cast vp your cheerefull eies, That God remaines, that once of nought Created Earth and Skies. With this Musicke of Marinaes, as with no delight else was he a whit altered, but lay groueling on his face, onely casting an eye vppon her, as hée were rather discon∣tented than delighted with her indeuour. Whereupon she beganne with morall prepts to reprooue him, and tolde him, that hée was borne a Prince, whose dignity being to gouerne others, it was most foule in him to misgouerne himselfe. Which while he continued in that sullen estate, he did no lesse, thus to mourne for the losse of a wife and
childe, or at any of his owne mis fortunes, approoued that he was an enemy to the authoritie of the heauens, whose power was to dispose of him and his, at their pleasure: and that it was as vnfit to for him to repine (for his conti∣nuing sorrow shewed he did no lesse) against their deter∣minations and their vnaltered willes, as it was for the Giants to make warre against the Gods, who were con∣founded in their enterprise. Not fitte to sorrow, quoth he, rising vp like a Cloude, that bespeakes thunder; presump∣tuous bewty in a childe, how darest thou vrge so much and there withall, in this rash distemperature, strucke her on the face. When she, who neuer vntill that time knw what blowes were, fell sodainely in a swowne: but bée∣ing againe recouered, shée cryed out; O humilitie! ordai∣ned especially for Princes, who hauing power ouer all, shuld contemne none, whither art thou fled? then wéeping a while; And O you Gods! creators both of heauen and earth, looke vppon my afflictions, and take compassion vppon me, that am vnfortunate in all things, I haue bin tossed from wrong to iniurie, I was borne amongest the waues and troublesome tempests of the Sea, my mother died in paines and pangs of child-birth, and buriall was denyed her on the earth, whome my father adorned with Iewelles layd golde at her head, and siluer at her féete, and inclosing her in a Chest, committed her to the Sea: As for me vnfortunate wretch, my father, who with prince∣ly furniture, put me (in trust) to Cleon and Dyonysa, who commanded a seruant of theirs to murder me, from whose cruelty by Pirates I was rescewed, brought by them to this Citty, and sold to haue béene hackneyd by a common Bawde, though (I thanke the heauens) I haue preser∣ued my chastity; and now after al these crosses, for my cur∣tesies to be strucke thus to bléeding! O cruell fate! By which tale of hers, Pericles being mooued, since by all the circumstances he ghessed she was his childe, and yet not knowing whether he might beléeue himselfe to be awake,
or in a dreame, he beganne agayne to capitulate with her, of her former relation, as namely, where she was borne, who were her parents, and what her name was. To the which she answered, My name is Marina, and so called because I was borne vpon the sea. O my Marina cryed out Pericies, bring strucke into such an extaste of ioy that hée was not able to containe himselfe! willing her agayne to discourse vnto him the storie of her misfortunes, for hée could not heare too much. Which she obeying him in, and he knowing her to be his childe, séeing that the supposed dead was risen again, he falls on hir necke, and kisses her, calles vpon Helycanus to come vnto him, shwes him his daughter, biddes him to knéele to her, thanketh Lysima∣chus that so fortunately had brought her to begette life in the father who begot her; so one while wéeping at others ioying, and his senses being masterd by a gentle conque∣rour, in that extreamitie of passion, he fell into a slumber: in which swéet sléepe of his, hée was by Diana, warned to hie to Ephesus: and there vpon the Altare of that Goddesse to offer vppe his sacrifice before the Priests, and there to discourse the whole progresse of his life: which he remem∣bring, being awake, he accordingly shipped himselfe with Lysimachus, Marina, and his owne subiects to perfourme. Who landing at Ephesus, and giuing notice of the purpose, for which he was come, he was by all the Priests and Uo∣taries attended to the Temple; and being brought to the Altare, this was the substance of his sacrifice, I Peri∣cles borne Prince of Tyre, who hauing in youth attained to all kinde of knowledge, resolued the Riddle of Antio∣chus, to the intent to haue married his daughter, whome he most shamefully defiled. To preserue my selfe from whose anger, I fled to sea, suffered shipwracke, was cur∣teously entertained by good Symonides king of Pentapolis, and after espoused his faire daughter Thaysa. At the nam∣ing of whome, she her selfe being by, could not choose but starte: for in this Temple was she placed to be a Nunne,
by Lord Cerimon, who preserued her life. But Pericles go∣ing on, when Antiochus and his daughter, quoth he, were by lightning strucke dead from heauen, I conducted my Queene with me from her fathers Court, with purpose to receiue againe my kingdome: where vpon the sea shée was deliuered of this my daughter, in that trauell she died, whom I inclosed in a Chest, and threw it into the Sea. When Thaysa standing by, and no longer being able to temper her affections, being assured he was her Lord, shée ranne hastily vnto him, imbraced him in her armes, and would haue kissed him. Which when Pericles sawe, hée was mooued with disdaine, and thrust her from him, ac∣cusing her for lightnes, whose modesty and good grace hée at his first entrance did commend, when she falling at his féete, and powring foorth her teares aboundantly, glad∣nesse compelled her to crie out, O my Lord Pericles, deale not vngently with me, I am your wife, daughter vnto Sy∣monides, my name is Thaysa, you were my Schoolemai∣ster, and instructed me in musicke, you are that Prince whome I loued, not for concupiscence, but desire of wise∣dome, I am she which was deliuered and died at the sea, and by your owne hands was buryed in the déepes; which wordes of hers, Lord Cerimon standing by, he was rea∣dy to auerre, but it néeded not: for Pericles, though at the first astonished, ioy had now so reuiued his spirites, that hée knew her to be herselfe: but throwing his head into her bosome, hauing nothing but this to vtter, he cried aloude, O you heauens! my misfortunes were now againe bles∣sings, since wée are agayne contracted; so giuing his daughter to her armes to embrace her as a child and Lysi∣machus to enfolde her as a wife, and giuing order the so∣lemnity of marriage should strait be prouided for: he then caused the bawd to be burnt, who with so much labor had sought to violate her princely chastitie, whilest Marina rewarded the pandar, who had béene so faithfull to hir: and then after he had seene hir mariage with Lisimachus, he lea∣ueth
Ephesus, and intendes for Tyre, taking Pentapolis in his way, whome by the death of good Symonides, as law∣ful heire, he was made soueraigne. He also highly rewar∣ded the poore Fisher-men, who had relieued him. From thence he arriued at Tharsus, where hée reuenged himselfe of Cleon and Dyonysa, by stoning them to death. From thence to Tyre, where peaceably he was receiued into his kingdome, and giuen also possession of all the territories of Antiochus, where by his wife, though in the declining of both their yéeres, it pleased the Gods to blesse him with a sonne, who growing to the lusty strength of youth, and the father declining to his graue, age being no lon∣ger able to be sustained by the benefite of nature, fell into certayne colde and dry diseases: in which case, the know∣ledge of his Physitions, could stand him in little steade, eyther by their cunning or experience, (so as no remedie being to be found against death) being in perfect memorie, he departed this life in the armes of his beloued Thaysa, and in the middest of his friendes, nobles, alies and chil∣dren in great honour, his kingdome of Tyrus be gaue by will to Lysimachus and his daughter Marina, and to their heires after them for euer, who liued long together, and had much comfort by their issue. Unto his Quéene Thay∣sa he gaue the two kingdomes of Antioch and Pentapolis for tearme of her life, and at her death to descend to her yong sonne Symonides. But Thaysa who could not then be yong since Pericles died olde, continued not long in her widows estate, butpining much with sorrow, and wearing with age, forsooke the present worlde, leauing her two kingdomes (according to her fathers will) to her yoong sonne Symonides. FINIS.
