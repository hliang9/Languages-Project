Love and Jealousie: OR, A Song in the Duke of GUIES. Tell me Thirsis, tell your anguish, why you sigh, and why you languish; when the Nymph whom you adore, Grants the blessing of possessing, what can Love and I do more? Love and I, what can Love and I do more? what can Love and I do more? Think 'tis Love beyond all measure, makes me faint away with pleasure, strength of Cordials may destroy, and the blessing of possessing, kills me with excess of joy. Thirsis how can I believe you, but confess and I'le forgive you; Men are false and so are you, never Nature fram'd a Creature, to enjoy and yet be true. Thirsis how can I believe you, but confess and I'le forgive you; Men are false and so are you; never Nature fram'd a creature, to enjoy and yet be true. Mine's a flame beyond expiring, still possessing, still desiring, fit for Loves Imperial Crown; ever shining, and refining, still the more 'tis melted down. Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball, near the Hospital-gate, in West Smithfield: 1683.
