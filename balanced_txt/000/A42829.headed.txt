Festum Festorum▪ OR, A DISCOURSE Touching the Holy Feast OF EASTER. SHEWING How it may be ESTABLISHED For EVER. By JOHN GADBURY, Student in Physick and Astrology. —What Holy Institution soever Other  of the Year have received, some from the Apostles, and some from the Fathers of the Church in succeeding Ages; We may be sure that this Saed  was Instituted by the Divine Authority of God and of  himself. Bishop of Durham's  of D. p. 223. Licensed, Decemb. 1st. 1686. LONDON Printed by N. Thopson, for the Company of Stationers, MCLXXXVII.
To My LORD, the LORD HENRY▪ EARL of PETERBOROW, Peer of ENGLAND, Lord MORDANT, Lord Baron of TƲ∣VEY, Groom of the STOLE and first Gentleman of His Majesty's BED-CHAMBER, Lord High-Steward to the QUEEN, Lord-Lieutenant of the County of NORTHAMPTON▪ One of the Lords of His Majesty's Most Honourable PRIVY-COUNCIL and Knight of the most Noble Order of the GARTER. Health, Happiness, and Length of Days be ever Wished. My LORD, HAVING attempted a Task of as great Use to the CHRISTIAN CHURCH, as of dif∣ficulty to perform, viz. The Reformation of Our COMMON CALENDAR, and
a Right Stating of the Holy Feast of EASTER, (I hope,) for Ever, I do in all Humility cast both my Self, and It at Your Lordships Feet, Imploring Your Honours Protection of both, so far only as Your Lordship shall judge the Work, and Authour Deserving. It is a Subject that hath caused more Heats in the Primitive Times, than any Other, and not without the Ex∣pence of much SWEAT and BLOOD; So Zealous were the Antient Christi∣ans in Contending for the TRUTH. This Method Once Embraced, as I hope, and am sure it will the sooner for Your Lordships Owning, there will never need any more Quarrels or Contentions about it. You are, (My Lord,) One of the Greatest Stars in our British Hemi∣sphere,
and move in an ORBE of Honour very near unto Royal PHAE∣BUS himself. Nay, I must, in all Hu∣mility, beg leave to remember the (Unthinking part of the) World, That, to your very Great Honour now, and Greater Glory in Ages to come, Your Lordship was Once nearly E∣clips'd with Him too; Being Con∣strain'd to an Unonable Travel in your Elder years for the Security of your Life and Liberty, when both were boldy struck  by the EXCLU∣SIONERS of our late Perilous Times, that bid so Fair for the Un∣inging of the GOVERNMENT it self. These things, (My Lord,) then be∣ing true, Your Lordship is the most Fit of any, (if at least you shall judge my
Mean, but Well-meant Pains, worthy so great regard,) to bring this Mer∣curial Discovery to the KINGS most ROYAL EAR. The Gogitating HERMES sometimes makes MO∣NARCHS shine as Gloriously, as the Valiant and Commanding Ma∣vors: And the Ever Famous JU∣LIUS CAESAR derives as Last∣ing, (I will not say so Great,) an Honour from his Correction of the CALENDAR, as from his Victory obtain'd in the Pharsalian Field. And if this my Minute Attempt happen to be but Embraced by your Lordship, I shall then hope to live to see MENSIS OCTOBRIS, (in our BRITISH CALEN∣DAR, at least,) Exchanger its
Name, for that more Glorious and Au∣spicious One, of MENSIS JACO∣BI: To which Remarkable Month your Lordship hath a more then Or∣dinary Title, as being most happily Born therein, and on a Day so near the best of KINGS, and in Con∣junction with a Most BLESSED EVANGELIST, though in Dif∣ferent years. Pardon, (My Lord,) I beseech you, my Great Confidence, in presu∣ming to Think That any thing I am able to Write should be Worthy of your Lordships Notice. And if This my Humble ESSAY should fail of a Ge∣neral Approbation, Let it, however, (with your Lordships Noble Fa∣vour,) stand me in this stead, viz. to Tell the World, and your Lordship,
how much I am, (according to my mean ,) willing to promote the English , and also, in a Just and Grae Duty to your Lord∣ship, Record my self, by many Obli∣gations, (My LORD,) Your Lordships Meanest Servant, And Ever Faithful Honourer, JOHN GADBURY
Festum Festorum▪ OR, A DISCOURSE Touching the ORIGEN and END Of the HOLY FEAST of EASTER. OF all the Feasts belonging to the Christian Calendar, we shall not incur Errour, if we Affirm, That the Holy Feast of EASTER is the Chief: It being as Ancient as our Blessed Saviour's Resurrection; In memory where∣of, it was declar'd, and instituted to be kept Holy, (saith St. Augustine) And, by
virtue thereof, all the SUNDAYS in the Tear besides. It is by the Primitive Fa∣thers, (as liberally quoted by the late Lear∣ned and Reverend Bishop of Durham,) ter∣med the FEAST of FEASTS, and the So∣lemnit of all Solemnities. And, hence it is that the learnedst Divines, (though of Dif∣ferent Opinions, I must not say of Different Churches, for CHRIST hath but ONE CHURCH on Earth,) do therefore with the Antients term it, and that very justly— The KING of DAYS, and QUEEN of FEASTS. As for the Name thereof, that is a com∣pellation made up of a German, and an Eng∣lish word, viz. Ost, and Star: The former of which the Saxons brought in use among us, viz. Oest signifying ARISING, or the EAST. For that the Sun, and all the Stars do Arise, or first shew themselves in the EAST. The later, viz. Star, alludes to our Blessed Saviour, the Bright, and MORN∣ING-STAR, whose Resurrection, or Ari∣sing
from the GRAVE, was perform'd on this Day, for the Salvation and Justification of all the Sons of ADAM, who claim the Benefit thereof by a True and Lively FAITH. Our English Glossographer, (Mr. Blunt) says, That EASTER is so named of EO∣STER, a Goddess of the Old Saxons, whose Feast they kept in April. Verstegan says the same; and affirms, moreover, that at this present in Saxony, this FEAST is cal∣led OSTERN, which comes of OSTER∣MONAET; their, and our Old Name of APRIL; in which Month this Glorious Christian Feastival most commonly hap∣pens. Howbeit, at sometimes we know it shifts place, according to the Moon's Motion, the Epact, &c. on which it de∣pends, and so may come to fall in MARCH, as in this Year 1687. it does. Indeed this Sacred Feast of EASTER hath certain Limits assign'd, which (without an Alteration by Authority) it can nei∣ther Transgress, or Transpass; and com∣monly
it makes its Progress or Perambu∣lation between the 22th. day of MARCH, and the 26th. day of APRIL, according to the Cycles, &c. on which it depends; and can therefore never go below the FORMER, or ascend beyond the LATER And, because the Boundaries of this Holy Feast are not commonly known, I will here present you with a Table of its pro∣per Limits, (according to the old Julian Correction) as I find it in that excellent Collection of DEVOTIONS, published by the late Right Reverend Bishop of Durham. Gold. Num. Easter Limit 1 April, 5 2 March, 25 3 April, 13 4 April, 2 5 March, 22 6 April, 10 7 March, 30 8 April, 18 9 April, 7 10 March, 27 11 April, 15 12 April, 4 13 March, 24 14 April, 12 15 April, 1 16 March, 21 17 April, 9 18 March, 29 19 April, 17
☞ Here you are to observe, That Ea∣ster Sunday is not in this Table set down against each Golden Number, but the Ea∣ster Limit only. And that it is the Sun∣day following the said Easter Limit, which is always EASTER DAY with us here in England. As for Example. In this Year 1687. the Golden Number is 16. now entring the Table under the Title of Golden Number, with 16. against it toward the right hand, I find March 21. which is the Easter Limit for this Year Now March the 21. happens on a Monday; so that the Sunday following, which is March the 27th. must be EASTER DAY. But if the Limit fall on a Sunday, it must not then be EASTER DAY, but the Sun∣day following always. Et sic de cateris. But to dilucidate this matter a little further; You may please to observe, That the Golden Number is the ground of the EASTER LIMIT, with regard had to the New, or Full Moon happening some∣what before, or after the VERNAL
EQUINOX. And in the Common-Prayer-Book, Printed Anno 1662. You have this plain and general Rule laid down for the constant finding of EASTER. EASTER DAY is always the first Sun∣day after the first FULL MOON; which happens near after the One and Twentieth day of MARCH. Where you are to Note, That the Full Moon here mention'd, is not the true Op∣position of the Luminaries in an Astrologi∣cal, but in an Ecclesiastical sense only; as it has been express'd in Common-Prayer-Books formerly, and is particularly men∣tion'd in the MASS-BOOK Printed by Kingston and Sution, in Quarto, at London, Anno 1555; which was the second year of Queen MARY; the Title whereof is, Mis∣sale ad usum Ecclesia Sarisburiensis. In which is taught how to find EASTER DAY by New or Full Moons, with these Directions.
Carmina docentia per Novilunia invenire Pascha. Post regum festa, quaere Novilunia trina, Post Dominica tertia, Pascha sacrum Celebra. Aliud. Post veris Aequinoctium quaere Pleilunium Et Dominica proxima sacrum celebra Pascha Non verius inveniens, si mille legas codices. The New Moon, (I say) here meant, is not the true ptica Conjunction of the SUN and MOON, but the Day only of the MOON's Mean Conjunction, as it was above 1300 years ago, and is in that Book found meerly by taking the Day a∣gainst which the proposed Year's GOL∣DEN NUMBER stands in the Margin of each Month. For the Calculator of that CALENDAR knew well enough that That day would be four Days after the NEW MOON of his own time, agreeable to the , or first appearance of the
MOON, and therefore directs us to be∣gin at the Day so found, and to tell up∣wards a Syllable to each Day, saying, In Caelis est hic; which if you do, the Syllable hic, will fall four Days above your GOL∣DEN-NUMBER, and there shew you the Day of NEW MOON for your time. The FULL MOON meant in those Verses are not so much as precise Day of the mean Opposition of the SUN and MOON, but are to be found in this man∣ner. To the Day of that Antient NEW MOON found by the GOLDEN-NUM∣BER. add 13. so have you the 14th. day of that Ecclesiastick CYCLIC Month. For, the GOLDEN-NUMBER of any year set to some Day, between March the 7th. and April the 6th. declares that Day to be the Ecclesiastical beginning of the year. And the grounds of this CYCLE are these, —March the 21st. was accounted the Day of the VERNAL AEQUINOX, (as yet it is with those that follow the ROMAN CORRECTION.) Now if this
(viz. March 8. the day succeeding the Boundary, March 7.) be the Earliest NEW MOON that can be admitted for a  Month, or the  of the  year: The next years FIRST MONTH will begin with March 27. And the Third years FIRST MONTH will begin March 16. The Fourth years FIRST MONTH on April the 4th. and so in order, as is here set down. March. Apr. March. March. March. 8.27.16. 4. 23.12.31. 20.9. 28.17. Apr. March. Apr. March. March. 5. 25.14. 2. 22. 11. 30. 19. And then March the 8th. again, as at the first. The  returning after 19. years very nearly to the same place again, as the  had been taught long before they were ; and as Astro∣nomy also at  demonstrates. I shall not here trouble my self to tell you why these 19.  or Be∣ginnings
of the FIRST MONTH were not (always) reckon'd in this order: For then I must also undertake to shew you how the CALENDARS in Missals and Common-Prayer-Books were made; and likewise how they came to differ. (A great unhappiness sure, to all that love Unity!) But this is certain, that the CA∣LENDAR in our Common-Prayer-Book, in the Edition of 1662. hath its RED NUM∣BERS restored to it; (in which there is no harm,) and the true Ecclesiastical NEW and FULL MOONS, with their assistance, are truly stated, as in this fol∣lowing Table.

And thus we have explain'd unto you the 19. EASTER LIMITS, according to Ecclesiastical appointment: Which many not knowing, are apt to quarrel with Astrolo∣gers about the right timing of this HOLY FEAST in their Almanacks. These are the Boundaries of EASTER, even as the 26th. of November is LIMIT of AD∣VENT; upon which day Saviour-Sunday never falls, but as soon after as may be. And EASTER you see hath every year a different LIMIT; upon which this FEAST is not to be celebrated, though it should fall on a SUNDAY, but upon the next SUNDAY following. Unless Men will wilfully oppose the Establish∣ment which Authority hath made, (as some conceited persons ambitiously do,) which is not only unsafe, but very hold and temerarious. And, here we may further Mer, That these LIMITS do not oppose those set down by the late mention'd Renowned PRELATE, but are the same with His,
in respect of the FULL MOON; but in regard of the NEW MOON, much lar∣ger, as any one but meanly skill'd in Num∣bers may by Inspection perceive. The beforesaid Right Reverend BI∣SHOP. according to these LIMITS, cal∣culated an ASTERTABLE for 80. years, beginning  166. and Printed it with his  But because it is the same with my EASTER TABLE, supputated for Two Hundred and odd years, (in respect at least of the Time un∣red,) I forbear Re-printing thereof, and shall here present you with an abstract of my own .

This Table needeth no Explanation; we will therefore proceed in our Discourse of this Holy Feast And that we may be the more plainly understood, let it be re∣membred, that there are Three kinds of EASTER, viz. The PASC  or the Jewish EASTER. The PASC , (I wish it were so) or our CASTER. The PASC , or the . CASTER. I. The  or Jewish Easter; which was called the PASSOVER (as some observe) from the Hebrew word Pach, which signifies to Leap, or to Pas over, or  [As our EASTER doth Leap, or Pass from one Week, Month or  to another, every year.] And it was instituted, Ano Mundi 2447. and ordained to be Celebrated from the 15th. day of the  Month called ABIB, (or March) to the 21st. day of the same In∣clusive. i. e. for VII. days together. Yet so, as that the 15th. day, and 21st. day were held  Sacred then the rest.
We may take notice, That ABIB, or March is justly called the First Month of the Year, by reason of the VERNAL EQUINOX its falling therein: In Ho∣nour whereof, (the Year at that time be∣ing Renewed unto us, and Nature presen∣ting us with a new delightful Spring,) KINGS formerly were used to date their REIGNS thence, as this Holy PASCHAL FEAST took its beginning: Whence one wittily writes— Of Months, and of New Fruits is ABIB Father, Kings Reigns were Reckon'd thence, and Feasts together. The VII. Days were also called the Feast of Azymes; viz. A time in which it was not Lawful to eat Ʋnleavened Bread; and the First of the Pascha, or EASTER, , because that there∣on the PASCHAL LAMB was Slain, and Eaten, as a Type of our Ever Blessed Sa∣viour's
Passion and Resurrection: Who, as he was the  of God,  from the Beginning of the World for Salvation to all the Sons of ADAM, so he took a∣way the  of the World, from all those that truly  on him. But the  having thus appear'd to us, we must not JUZE, and still rest in the  (i e.) we ought no longer to ce∣lebrate the Passver after the Jewish, but line. I remember to have read somewhere of a  (I think 'twas S. Ignatius) who says, He that keeps EASTER after the manner of the JEWS, is a Companion of them that  our SAVIOOR. But the saying seems somewhat too strict, at least in my Opinion; since to Commemo∣rate the  at all, is a Duty of RELI∣GION, and bespeaks a Veneration to the Memory of our  (whether in Type, or ) in such as observe it Religi∣y, though they do not Celebrate it as they ought: 'Tis the  or Business
of RELIGION to enjoyn, and practice the keeping thereof; but 'tis a MATH∣MATICAL, performanc to appoint the right Tim of its Observation. II. The P  (for so it was, and sometimes, (yet but sometimes,) is still so,) or That EASTER, which we observe, (if we believe ) was first ordained 322. years  ∣stum, or after the  of our  SAVIOUR. For  Great, that God-like Christian Emperor, (who, as History informs us) had so great an Honour for the  Crucify'd Lord that on  he arose, and bestowed the richest  and ∣ties all over his EMPIRE And from His Example, his  were wont to Releas all PRISONE on this day, excepting such as were Guiy of M, or some other very His  And in the purer times of Christianity, ∣STIANS were constantly accustomed joy∣fully
to Greet each other, with an , Christ is risen. And the usual Response was, Christ is risen indeed. Nay, those that were Enemies at this time, were Re∣conciled by the only Pious Amulet of a Surrexit Christus, and so became Friends again. Oh! that so Divine and Heavenly a Practice were Reviv'd among us! This Noble Emperour, I say, taking notice of divers Errours, and Contentions which constantly happen'd among Christians, af∣ter the days of the Apostles, about the Celebrating of this HOLY FEAST of our Saviour's Rising from the Grave; Assem∣bled from all Nations 318 Bishops, and other Learned Persons, as well Greeks, as Latines, and Aegrptians; such as could withal well determine of the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, upon which this HOLY FEAST depends: Among whom, EUSEBIUS Bishop of Caesarea was chief; He being a most Excellent Astronomer, and Mathematician. And he kept them together near two years at his own pro∣per Costs and Charges.
And lo! in the year 323. they Institu∣ted a NEW GOLDEN-NUMBER, dif∣fering from that in use among the Ro∣mans; by which New Number or Cycle, this FEAST was appointed to be Celebra∣ted, not precisely upon the first FULL MOON of the FIRST MONTH, (as before you heard) or after the VERNAL AEQUINOX, lest the World should thereby be taught to Judaine, afresh, (as St. Austin well observes) but, statim post presently after, viz. upon the Sunday next following the first FULL MOON, that should happen after the VERNAL AEQUINOX. Terminis Paschalis (inquit Scaliger) est quarta decima Luna mensis, Paschalis Christianiseculo Constantini Mag∣ni. But this Institution of EASTER, as if begun under a Moveable Horoscope, (to speak like an Astrologer.) was not conti∣nued above Seven years after the great Council of Nice. For Anno 330. post Chri∣stum, there arose many Differences be∣tween
the Greeks and Romans about it: Which Controversie growing unto so great an height, and so many difficulties started therein; (Good ASTRONO∣MERS sure were very scarce in those Days) that it continued near 200 Years before it could admit of any Reconcilia∣ian: To the great Gref and Trouble of CHRISTIANS, and Scandal of CHRI∣SLANTY. But at length, for the quieting of all Contentions about this SACRED FEAST, in the time of JUSTINIAN the Emperor, viz. 527. there arose one DIONYSIUS ABBAS, a Noble Roman, (and one cer∣tainly  by God, for so good and glorious a WORK!) And he taking into consideration the many ERRORS broach∣ed about this HOLY FEAST, began to frame Tables of EASTER, according to the mind of the forer Council; which he compleated Anno 532, post Crsum. And so happy and fortunate was the Noble  in this his performance, That,
the great Council of CHALCEDON being satisfied with the Truth and Excellency thereof, were pleased not only to ap∣prove of, and own it, but also to Enact, That whosoever held any other EAS, than tha which was  the Bl∣of Rome,  should be re∣ped and  against as an HE RETICK. But before I proceed any further, I conceive it requisite, for the satisfaction of those that are unacquainted with the Antiquity and Honour of this SACRED FEAST; and of the many Troubles that have invaded the World, by reason of its not being truly Observed, or Celebrated, to transcribe a few  from the Learned Dr. CAVE, in his  concerning this matter, viz. Of all the  observed in the Christian Church, EASTER chal∣lenges the precedence, both for its Anti∣quity, and the great  about it; that in, and from the very times of the
APOSTLES (besides the weekly re∣turns of the Lord's Day,) there has been always an Anniversary Festival in me∣mory of CHRIST's RESURRECTION, no Man can doubt that has any insight into the Affairs of the ANTIENT CHURCH. All the dispute was a∣bout the particular time when it was to be kept; which became a matter of as famous a Controversie, as any that in those Ages exercised the Christian World. The state of the Case was briefly this: The Churches of Asia the Less kept their EA∣STER upon the same day whereon the Jews Celebrated their PASSOVER, viz. upon the Fourteenth Day of the First Month (which always began with the appearance of the MOON,) mostly answering to our March; and this they did upon what Day of the Week soever it fell, and hence were stiled Quart Decimans, because keeping EASTER Quarto decima Lunae, upon the Four∣teenth Day after the , or Appearance
of the. MOON The other Churches and especially those of the WES did not follow this Custom, but kept ∣STER upon the  following the Day of the  part∣ly the more to  the  and partly to distinguish between  and  The  pleaded for themselves the pratice of the Apostle  Bishop of Snyrna, who had liv'd and convers'd with them, having kept it upon that Day, together with St.  and the rest of the  as , (who himself knew  and doubtless had it from his own mouth,) speaks in a Letter about this very thing, though himself was on the other side. And POLCRATES in a Letter to the same purpose, instances, not only in St. JOHN, but St. PHILL the  who himself, and his whole  used to keep it, from whom it had been con∣vey'd down in a constant and un-inter∣rupted
Observance through all the Bi∣shops of those places, some whereof he there Enumerates; and tells us, That  of that place in a cunstan  had been his Kinsmen, and himself the  and that it had ne∣ver been kept by them upon any other Day: This we are not so to under∣stand, as if St.  and the Apostle had Instituted this  and Commanded it to be observed on that Day, but rather that they did it by way of  accommodating their Practice in a matter Indifferent to the humour of the AEWIS CONVERTS, (whose number in those Parts was very great) as they had done before in seve∣ral other Cases, and particularly in ob∣serving the  or Saturday, The  Churches also, (says Eusebius,) had for their Patronage an APOSTOLICAL TRADITION or at least pretended it; and were the much more Numerous Party. This  was the Spring
of great Blushern in the Church; for the Bishops of Rome stickled hard to impose their Cust upon the  Chur∣ches; whereupon  comes over to  to confer with ANCETS who was then  about it; And though they could not agree the matter, yet they parted fairly. After this  renew'd the Qu∣rel, and was so fierce and peremptory in the Case, that he either actually did, or severely threaten'd to  the EASTERN CHURCHES, for stan∣ding out against it. This Rath, and Bold attempt, was ill resented by the So∣ber, and Moderate Men of his own Party, who writ to him about it; and particularly , (a Man, as Eusebi notes, truly answering his Name, both in his  and his Life, QUIET and EACABLE,) who grave∣ly reproved him for Renting the  of the CHURCH and troubling so ma∣ny  for observing the
Custms derived to them from their ANCESTORS; with much more to the same purpose. But the ASIAN BI∣ little regarded what was either said, or done at  and still went on in their , though by the dili∣gent Practices of the other Party, they lost ground; but yet still made shift to keep the Cause on Foot, till the coming of , who finding this  amongst others, much to  the  of the CHURCH, did for this, and some other Reasons, Summon the Great Council of NICE; by whom this Question was solemnly determin'd, and EASTER ordain'd to be  upon One, and the same Day throughout the World, not according to the Customs of the JEWS, but upon the LORDDAY, and this Decree Ra∣tify'd and Publish'd by the Imperial Let∣ to all the  Thus far this Learned Author,  Part 1. cap. 7. pag. 185. &c.
To add one Testimony further in de∣fence of this Argument, I find in a  lately Printed by N. Thompson, Entitled, The State of Chrch-Affairs  under the Romans, and British  viz. —In this Council (of ) was further Order made, for the  Observation of EASTER, upon the first Sunday following the 14th. Day of the first MON after the VERNAL AEQUINON: For the better finding out of which, it was recommended to the Ce of the  of ∣andria, every year to give notice to the Bishop of  upon what Day EASTER was to be observed; and this was to be communicated unto all  MOTER . And during MASS on the  a  with a loud Voice, declar'd the follow∣ing EASTER, whereby NT and all other  were regula∣ted: And accordingly the  also were guided, until  from
ROME was interrupted by Domestick Brails, and the Invasion of the SAXONS. And when by such interruption the Bri∣ans vary'd from the Western Churches, they kept not ASTER as the Quarto Deci, precisely upon the 14th. Day of the MOON after the Jewish mode: But if that 14th. Day happen'd upon a Sunday, they did not defer the Observa∣tion until the Snday following, as other Catholick Christian CHURCHES used to do. This Little Quottion would bear a  which I could willingly afford to it, did not I A at Conciseness. But I refer you to the Book it self, which is worth your perusal. III. To re-assume our former matter: The Correction by DIONYSIUS ABBAS, by virtue of the Decree of the Council, not of VICE, (though that led to this,) but of CHALCED, (as I mentioned be∣fore,) continued about 1050. years, with∣out
so much as being once question'd, viz. unto the year 1582. No Man until that time ever daring to presume to  the Celebration of this But then, viz. Anno  being so eminently obvious in the  of its Celebration, (so hard and difficult a matter it is for Time and Truth long to keep company together.) The word and worthy minded  the XIII. was (by some Divine Impulse cer∣tainly) most happily moved to a Corre∣ction of the  and so com∣manded the  to be framed; which after his Name, and in Memory of so excellent a Service to the  was call'd the  For it was most apparently seen that the Aequinones fled Backward, viz. from March the 21st. day, unto Mar the 11th. day, no less than Ten Days in time. (A great Errour! and was most fit to be a∣mended.) By reason of which Anti∣tion, there happen'd two FULL MOONS
after the Vernal Aequinow, before EASTER could be Celebrated: And consequently there would be TWO EASTERS in One Year; or within the Compass of 365 Days; as it still very often happens with us in England, and in other Places, where ever the  Accoun is used, for want of a due Correction. The observation of which  Er∣an. (I say) occasion'd the good POPE  to alter the  which he did by substracting Ten Day from the Family Tray of , to the Fifteenth Day thereof, Inclusive, Anno 182. for prevention of so remarkable an Incon∣venience as the common EASTERTA. ES were chargeable withal. Which Anticipaun of the  if con∣tinued, in process of time, Our BLES∣NED  and St. JOHN BA , (as the skilful in Astronomy ob∣serve,) must come to exchange their  and the  of RTST's  fall in  when the
is in Cancer; and that of the BAPTIST, in December, when the Sun is in Capri∣corn. An ERROUR which greatly be∣hoved the then Christian Authority to com∣mand a correction of. And for prevention of this  (an offence even against the Law of Na∣ture, as charging the orderly motions of the STARS with disorder,) the  Church have Reform'd their CA∣DAR, and PASCHAL TABLES to such a degree of certainty, that they always produce their EASTER on the SUN∣DAY following the first FULLMOON post Aequinoctium Vernalem: Nearly (not fully,) agreeable to the Decree of the COUNCIL of NICE Unto which, the Rule for finding EASTER even in our Common-Prayer-Book consents, though the TABLE of this HOLY FEAST therein be very often contrary thereunto. As indeed to our shame it must, until we shall be so happy as to obtain a COR∣RECTION of the ∣DAR,
by which our great FESTIVAL is at present governed. But, what then? Is the emendation of POPE GREGORY exactly true? It were indeed to be wished so, but we know it falls short of Verity, though not so much as the JULIAN ACCOUNT: Yes, and calls also for a CORRECTION, though not so loudly and strongly. It is a Younger Establishment, and therefore more vigo∣rous and similar to TRUTH. Whereas ours is as Antien as the good DIONY∣IƲS EXIGƲƲS, and with Age grown very weak and decrepid, humbly imploring AUTHORITY to consider its case, and yield it such relief, and support, as to their Wisdoms shall seem most fit and convenient. But although the Gregorian Account be not so compleat and perfect as may be wished, I will yet acknowledge (with Mr. Hooker, and others,) that it is much more Correct and Certain than the JƲ∣AN. And that in several regards:
First, (as he well observes,) the Quantity of the Gregorian Year doth better accord to the Heavenly Motions. Secondly, for that the AEQUINOXES and SOLSTICES are thereby more firmly bound to certain Days. And Thirdly, because EASTER is (generally) more truly Celebrated, ac∣cording to the mind of the Doctors and Fathers of the NICENE COUNCIL. Nevertheless we may complain, (with Clavius,) That the Solar year it self is not exactly determin'd: The exact motion of the SUN is not truly known, as may be seen by comparing Astronomical Tables, even of the best and latest Authors, Kep∣ler, Wing, Bullialdus, Shackerly, &c. Alas it is not the work of a private Hand, or Head, that can conquer this HYDRA: It becomes the tremend Pains and En∣deavours of a General Council, with an EMPEROUR or RING present at it, and in the Head of it, thereby the better to give Encouragement to so Great and Glorious a Work as in those of Nice, and
Chalccdon. In the later of which, when they came to an accord about this Holy Feast, they all with one Voice made this Pious Acclamation, Ʋnum Pascha in Orbi Terrarum! There is but ONE EASTER now all the World over. What hath been, may be, and we have the same God of Truth to rely on: The same Igenuity to assist us: We want only the same Industry, (and I was about to say the same Encouragement,) with them that have gone before us. Let us observe further, That this Holy Feast of FASTER, both for its Name and Use, of All Feasts ought to be most punctually and truly observed. Of the Name we have spoken somewhat before, and something likewise of its Ʋse. But it may moreover be remembred, that the HOLY CHURCH, for the advantage of all Pl Chrians, hath appointed it to be observed as a time of PACIFICATI∣ON, when to bring our Peace Offerings to God, and to One Another. And it is
therefore justly stiled FESTƲM PACIS; the blessed Feast of Peace; because at this time the Sun of Righteousness, and PRINCE of PEACE, arose from the Grave, (according to what was Prophe∣sied long before of him,) to bring PEACE and Salvation to all Men. And how requisite it is to have a FEAST of so glo∣rious a Memorandum, and Immense Ad∣vantage to the World, truly Stated and Observed, I submit to the Judgement of all Wise Men, and good Christians. I well remember what a great Bustle, Anno 1664, there was in this Nation, a∣bout the right observing of this HOLY FEAST. The KING and COUNCH were troubled with complaints about it. And it was alledged to the Kings Majesty. that all the Almanack-makers for that year were mistaken in the right timing of this FEAST, and had imposed a wrong EA∣STER upon the World. Upon which noisy Charge, the Learned Dr. PELL. Chaplain to the (then) Arch-Bishop of
Canterbury, wrote an Ingenious Discourse in a Letter to a Friend in London, which was afterwards Printed, bearing this Title, EASTER not MISTIMED. In which, this worthy Gentleman, plain∣ly proved where the Errour-lay, and the Astrologers, or Almanack-makers were also justly defended, as well in respect of the Truth of their Art, as from an impossibi∣lity of their confederating together, to delude the World with a False Easter, whereas many of them lived remote from London, and from each other, and the most of them unknown One to the Other. And the next year, viz. 1665. several of them that wrote Almanacks, as Mr. WHARTON, M. WING, Mr. BOOKER, and my SELF, as sensible of the Inju∣stice, as well as Unreasonableness of that ridiculous CLAMOUR, wrote a particu∣lar Defence of the ART, as to that mat∣ter, in the several ALMANACKS of that year, as may be seen by any that please to take the pains to peruse them.
But now, that we may not only talk of ERRORS, but teach how to set them Strait and Even, let me here humbly and faithfully endeavour to shew how they may be amended. How to keep EASTER truly for Ever. In my pursuit of this Excellent VERI∣TY, I have found out Two very Easie Ways, whereby to accomplish this Illustri∣ous End; (Nay, they are in several re∣spects the same, though seemingly diffe∣rent.) as proceeding from Two very Lear∣ned Men, and Excellent Astronomers, even of our own Age. Which proves that the Scientifical Genius of this Intelligent Nation is not at REST until it have not only discover'd, but done something of SER∣VICE to so great and glorious a Truth, as is the right Establishment of this HOLY FEAST. I. The first way I have met with for Establishing the right observation of this
HOLY FEAST, that it may no more be liable to Errour, is from the Works of that late Learned Gentleman, Sir GEORGE WHARTON, Baronet. But before I discover the way, give me leave, from the same Author, to shew you what great Errours will occur, in case the CALENDAR be not corrected, viz. Without a Correction of the Calendar, EASTER DAY will fall a week diffe∣rent from the Time assign'd by the Rule in the Common-Prayer-Book, as it hath happen'd since the Year of Christ, 1600. Twenty Times, to Anno 1664. viz. In the Years 1602. 1609. 1610. 1613. 1616. 1619. 1620. 1623. 1626. 1630. 1637. 1640. 1643. 1646. 1647. 1650. 1653. 1657. 1661. 1664 And will so again, (says this worthy Author) unless a Re∣formation be obtain'd,) in the Years 1667. 1669. 1673. 1677. 1681. 1684 1685. 1687. 1688. 1691. 1694. 1697. And Thirty One times more before the Year 1800.
Nor is this all: For there oft-times happens a whole Monthy Errour, as to the time of the Celebration thereof, ha∣ving already fallen out so  since that of  viz. in the years 1625. 16  and so will a∣gain, (without a  of the ∣lendar) in the years  1723. 174. 1750.  and in the year 07. For in those years there will happen (from the ) two Full Moons before our EASTER can be kept. Nay, there falls out very often no less than 35. days, (or span) ∣ROUR, in the time of our EASTER, having already fallen out so no less than Eleven  since the year  viz. in the years,  1622. 16  1663. and so will again, (without an amendment of the ) in the years, 16.  And just  more before the year 1800.
But, in the years 2437. 2467. 2491. &c. there will be 42 days ERROUR, and some time afterward no less than 49 days: And after the year 2698. (if the old Caledar should be still retain'd) it will Never again happen according to the Rule of the Church: which fixes it on the Sunday following the first Full Moon next after the VERNAL AEQUI∣NOS. Vid. Calend. Carol. pro An. 1665. Now, let us consider the way he teaches to , and prevent these ERROURS for time to come; And that is this, viz. —That if all the  were omit∣ted for Fiy , that alone would gradually, and insensibly, without the least inconveniency, bring us  Day before the  ACCOUNT, and be exactly agreeable to the SUNS place at the  of our  SA∣VIOUR. Whereas the very GREGO∣ (though now the Best and the Truest) would be Two
day less Ex; That being only reduced to the  at . And, if after this, the  be kept as before (except every 132. years, where∣in the EAF-DAY must be omitted for ever,) or else, that  Day be struck off every 100 years (except in each 400.) for ever; there would need no more to have our  of  (and all other  there∣in depending) kept according to  Observation. Se the Demonst. For by supposing the  Year to be (after ) 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes, 4 Seconds, 21 Thirds, the Annual  allowed it by  NAR, will be 10 Minutes, 55 Seconds, 39 Thirds, which  in 132 Years; and but 2 Minutes, 25 Seconds, 48 Thirds, over. And 3 Days in 400 Years, with 51 Minutes over;
which makes but One Day in 11294 Years, very inconsirable. And Oh! that our British Nation, (as Polite in Arts, &c. as any other Countrey in Europe, or perhaps in the whole World.) might be but so happy as to as∣sume the Glory of a right Correction of the ALENDAR, even for ASTER's AKE A  most Sacred, as being of ; and ever in use among Christine since the Glorinas Resur  of our  and SAYDUR. The Good and Pios Emperour, CON∣STANTINE the Great, termed it, and that truly, The most  of EASTS. Even that CONSTANTINE which first gave Wings to CHRISTIANITY; who after his having Embraced the  of the Ever BLESSED JESUS, most wor∣thily and happily Established it by a LAW. True it is, there hath been (as before was remembred,) many  be∣tween the EASTERN and WESTERN
Churches, about the right Observation of this HOLY FEAST, and several Councils conven'd about it, who have endeavour'd to set it right. But I say, (with that most Learned and Excellent Prelate, BI∣SHOP ANDREWS,) they met, not a∣bout the FEAST it self, (for that was never disputed by Christians) but about the true time of its Celebration only. BAST himself, (though guilty of Heresie in the business of this great STIVA,) never denied an  but question'd the  of its tion. As indeed any Man may reasonably do, (provided he do not with  affront Authority) considering the many Errours and  which have been broach'd about it; and never fear being Branded as an  for so doing. This  was the first Man that started the  of the QƲAR∣TO-DEC a  that held it unlawful to keep  but upon the Fourteenth Day  (whence
it was denominated,) which was agree∣able to the observation of the Jemish Pass∣ver: A Prail no way comporting with the Honour of Christianity, or of our Blessed  Resurrection. II. To return from what I digressed: Because I am enter'd upon so Excellent and Divine , (fit for the Imploy∣ment of a more Learned and Worthy Pen, I confess.) I will omit nothing that may be necessary for the Correction, and right keeping of this SACRED FEAST. I will therefore subjoyn another Dnstra∣tion of a  of the CALENDAR. Which, (that I may not incur the hateful Censure of a ,) I do own to have found Printed  (imperfectly) with a  of the MOVEABLE FEATS for 532 years to come, from that time; Calculated by some Curions  Hand, to me wholly un∣known. I wish I knew the Industrious and Laborious Author thereof, that I
might, (Nomine,) pay him his much merited respect. For had I been acquain∣ted with that his worthy Work sooner, it had saved me a vast deal of Pains in the compiling of my EASTER TABLE for more than 200 years to come, from  1677. (an Abstract whereof I have be∣fore Inserted.) Which  I performed at the Command of the Honourable GEORGE , Esquire, my most Noble  and  since deceased.—'Tis this. An  toward the Reformation of the  Cdar. The quantity of the Solar ear is said to consist of 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Mi∣nutes, 16 Seconds. Others will have it to be two or three Seconds more. I con∣ceive two or three Seconds in this case makes an  Variation. I shall therefore adhere to the first, viz. That the quantity of the true Solar ear is,
365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes, 16 Se∣conds. h. m. se. 5 49 16 5 49 16 5 49 16 5 49 16 23 17 4 The odd 5 ho. 49. min. 16. sec. in 4 years, (as in the Mar∣gin,) makes but 23 h. 17 m. se. 4 Which 23 h. 17. m. 4 se. is less than a whole day, by 00 h. 42 m. 56 se. So that the making of the Fourth Tear to consist of 366 Days, (which we call Leap-ear) doth thrust back the VERNAL AEQUNOX the quantity of — 00 h. 42 m. 56 se. And if there should be no Interalation of One Day in Four Years, so that the Fourth Year should consist but of 365 Days; then will the VERNAL AEQUINOX be thrust forward in Four years, the quantity of— 23 h. 17 m. 04 se.
In 1664. (the Number of Years Elapsed from the Birth of our SAVIOUR, and the particular Year which the AUTHOR made use of,) are contained 4, 6 Leap-Years; which 416 being multiplied by 42 m. 56 sec. do make 12 days, 9 hours, 40. min. 16. sec. so that by the observation of 416 Leap-Yers together, without the omission of any one, the AEQUINOXES are thruse back in the Year of our Lord 1664. the quantity of— 12 d. 9 h. 40 m. 16 se. And if the CALENDAR continue without Reformation for the space of 1664 Years more, the VERNAL AEQUI∣NOX will be in February For the Refor∣mation whereof, I offer this Expedient.
To Reduce the VERNAL AEQUI∣NOX to the same Day upon which it was at the Birth of CHRIST. Let Thirteen Leap-Year. be omitted; that is, let the Year consist but of 365 Days, for Fisty two Years following the Year 004, and the VERNAL AEQUI∣NOX will insensibly return on the same day it was at the Birth of CHRIST. See the Demonstration d. h. m. se. 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 00 23 17 04 12 14 41 52 It appeareth above, that the omision of one LEAP-YEARS doth put forward the AEQUI∣NOX, the quantity of 23 h. 17 m. 4 sec. and therefore the omission of 13 LEAP-YEARS toge∣ther, do make 12 days, 14 hours, 41 minutes, 52 seconds, (as in the Margin,) so that the omission of 13 LEAP-YEARS together, will make the QUI∣NOES to run for∣ward the quantity of 12 d. 15 h. 51 m. 52 se.
It appeareth also above, That Anno 166, the VER∣NAL AEQUINOX was run back the quantity of— 12 d. 9 h. 40 m. 16 se. So that substracting 12 d. 9 h. 40 m. 16 se. (the quan∣tity which the AEQUINOX was run , Anno, 166.) from 12 d. 14 h. 41 m. 52 se. the quantity which the Omission of 13 LEAP-YEARS will thrust for∣ward the AEQUINOX, An∣no 1716, the remainder is, 5 h. 1 m. 36 se. By which it plainly appears, that if 13 LEAPYEARS be omit∣ted, (as is before expressed) the AEQUINOX, Anno. 16, will be  but only the quantity of— 00 d. 5 h. 13 m. 6 se. The AEQUINOXS being thus  (or by what  it shall please His Gracious Majesty to cause it to be )
it being once done, ☽ may be kept from running Back, or Forward, the quantity of Twenty four Hours for Ever, after this manner, viz. To keep the AEQUINOXES from An∣ticipation. Let every 34th. LEAP-TEAR be omit∣ted, and the Anticipation will not be the quantity of word in 10000 Years. The Demonstration whereof followeth. It is before Demonstrated, That the keeping of ONE LEAP-YEAR doth put back the NOXES 42 min. 56 sec. and therefore the keeping of 33 LEAP-YEARS together, doth put them bark the quantity of— 23 h. 36 m. 48 se. Also by Omission of One LEAP-YEAR, (as is before expressed,) they are  — 23 h. 17 m. 04 se.
The Difference, or Anti∣cipation therefore in 136 Years, is but— 00 h. 19 m. 44 se. So that it is  That if from reducing the AEQUI∣NOX, viz. An.  three LEAP-YEARS be kept, and the 34th. viz.  be omitted, the going  of the AEQUINOXES in every 136 years, will be but 19 m. 44 sec. And taking the 19 min. 44 sec. (the quantity run back from the  to the year 1852.) from 5 ho. 1 min. 36 sec. (the  it was too forward Anno 1716.) the remainder that the AEQUINOXES will be too forward,  will be the quantity of— 04 h. 41 m. 52 se. So that it will be above  after the  before the AEQUI∣NOXES will be put  the  of
ONE MINUTE And in 9000 Years af∣ter that, if every 34th. LEAP-YEAR be omitted, (as aforesaid,) the Anticipation will not be the quantity of Twenty four Hours, and may then (by the Omission of another LEAP-YEAR more,) be Redu∣ced. Thus far this ENCELLENT AU∣THOR. Now, how requisite it is that AUTHO∣RITY be humbly put in mind of a Mat∣ter so August and Weighty, as is the right Observation of the HOLY FEAST of our Blessed 's Resurrection, will, I hope, most fully appear from the soregoing Dis∣surs as also by divers pre-visional Conse∣quences. For without a Correction of the CALENDAR, we shall be Obnoxious to many ERRORS, and most certainly find, I. That within the compass of a very small Circuit of Years, viz. from this very Year of 1687, to the Year 1702 (A short ime only) we shall be  of no
less than ight or Nine apparent ER∣ROURS in respect of the right Timing of the Holy. Fst of EASTER. Almost as many ERROURS as Years. Not to men∣tion what more will certainly be found after that Year; which will, (indeed) be very Numerous. As before you have plainly been inform'd. II. In Tract of Time, if no Correction be obtain'd, the very Season of the Year will be vary'd so much, that our WIN∣TER will be found at D-SUMMER; and our Sum or  Days. will appear at : and our BLESSED  and the BAPTIST be forced to Exchange their TROPICKS. as before you have heard. III. The , (though in it self not absolutely true,) will, (as in∣deed already it frequently doth,) carry the GARLAND from the Julian Account, and make it to be look'd on as a anger to TRUTH
IV. If no Correction of our CALEN∣DAR be made, we shall be commonly constrain'd to the Keeping of Two EA∣STERS in Oe Year, or within the Com∣pass of less than 365 Days. As it fell out A 1668, and must again the nxt Year 1688, and very often afterwards. V. Without a Correction of the CA∣LENDAR, our Learned'st Divines, and storians, as well as Mahematicians, will be at a Loss, in the right assigning of EA∣STER, and stand liable to be Taxed, or Ted with IGNORANCE in the just, and proper LIMITS of this Sacred Feast; as the Learned and Noble BARONIƲS once was, by the Industrious Sethus Cal∣visius, that Excellent . VI. For want of an mendation of the  CALENDAR, our CHURCH and STATE in Time will be compell'd to the like Trble, as once was the good Bishop of Alexandria, viz. To send their Pascha∣ into all. Parts of His Majesty'
Dominions to give Warning for the right Observation of EASTER. which must prove a very great trouble. But the Consideration of these things, and of many other Consequences, (not readily foreseen,) hence arising, I most humbly submit to the Wisdom of those in AUTHORITY over us, in CHURCH and STATE, who are (if GOD so please,) able, not only to Compass, but Command so great and needful, as well as useful a CORRECTION of the CALENDAR, which we at this Day, by Authority, must, and do follow, though in it self very Erro∣neous and Defective. According to this Essay, for an Emen∣dation of the CALENDAR, I will here insert a TABLE for the true finding out the Dominical Letter, and EASTER∣DAY, (upon which all the other Move∣able Feasts depend,) for Two hundred Tears yet to come: Which if Authority shall vouchsafe to Approve of, and Countenance, may be continued for Ever.

Now if Authority shall think fit to ap∣prove hereof, the same GOLDEN-NUM∣BER, AEPACT, &c. may still be continu∣ed, as is in Ʋse with Us at the present, and no other Alteration required in Either, than what is found by this NEW TABLE, viz. by Omission of 13 LEAP-YEARS, ac∣cording to the former Rule. Let not any Ingenious Artist, or others wonder that this New Table differs from the common EASTER TABLES, or our present Ephemerides, or the ordinary Me∣thods for the finding the Time of this HO∣LY FEAST; for so it must needs do, since the LEAP-YEARS for 52 Years to∣gether are omitted, according to this New Hypothesis for the Correcting of the present ERROURS attending it. By reason whereof this HOLY FEAST, will some∣times, (seemingly,) fall upon different Days, not only of the Monch, but Week, in respect of the present Establishment. And so it will continue to do until Anno 1852. In which Year the LEAP-DAY,
(according to the former Rule,) again will be omitted, as you may see by the TABLE. After which time the GOL∣DEN-NUMBER, and Dominital Letter, (as the Table exhibits to your view,) will come into the  Order they were, as in forer Years, or as they are at the present. And then also the LEAP-YEARS will keep their right Courses, as now, (except before excepted,) for many Ages to come, and be subject to no Errour at all. To conclude, I have before mention'd One grand occasion of Errours happening in the Time of this HOLY FEAST to be the Precession of the VERNAL AEQUI∣NOX, which from the first Council of Nice, to our Times, hath Anticipated not fewer than Eleven Days. It falling now on, or about the 10th Day of March; whereas at the time of that uncil, it was on the 21st. Day of the same Month, &c. But there is another Ground also of this Errour, (which I mention'd not before,) viz. The Lunations or  of the  and Moon,
which by reason of the too great quantity allowed them, do, in every 19 Years Anti∣cipate almost an Ho and an Half; and in 132 Years and an half, One whole Day: And therefore not Exactly to be found by the Golden-Number, although on those Lunations the Feast of ASTER depen∣deth, as of It all the rest of the Moeable Feasts. Now both these together were the just occasion of the Roman Emendation, whereby that CHURCH doth always produce EASTER on the Sunday follow∣ing the first FULL MOON next after the VERNAL AEQINOX agreeable to the Decree of the Nicene Council, and also to the Rule for finding thereof in our English Common-Prayer-Book, —When He is come—He will lead you into All Truth, .

POST-SCRIPT. IF the Reader prove so Christianly kind, as to Correct the ERRORS of the Press and Author. I have little to Apologize for: Excepting what may possibly be Objected by some TENDER STOMACHS, about its being Printed with Red Letters.—To satisfie the Soruple of such, I assure them, (1.) It was no SUPERSTITIOUS conceit led me thereto, but as I discourse of the MOST HOLY of All CHRISTIAN FEASTS, so I had a desire it should be Printed somewhat Semblable to the HOLY RUBRICK, it being the most GLORIOUS FEASTIVAL therein. (2.) I was wil∣ling to advance the Honour of the ENG∣LISH IMPRIMARY, and to shew the Learned of our Christian Church and Nati∣on, That Common-Prayer-Books, Missals, Breviaries, Manuels, &c. may be as Nobly and Gracefully PRINTED in ENGLAND, as in any other part of the World. 'Tis hoped therefore that the Printing thereof thus, may pass without any Sinister Con∣struction, or Censure of Any. FINIS.
