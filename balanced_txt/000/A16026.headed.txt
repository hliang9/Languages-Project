In die Innocencium sermo pro Episcopo puerorum.
Laudate pueri do∣inum. psalmo Centesi∣mo .xijo. et pro huius col∣lacionis fundamento. PRayse ye childern almyghty god as the phylosophre sayth in dyuerse places. All those thynges that haue the ha¦byte of parfyght cogny∣cyon may moue themself and conueye themself to theyr ende / as a beest ha∣uynge sensyble knowle∣ge / and man more par∣fyghter / bothe sensyble & Intellygyble may mo∣ue themself whether they wyll / and so conueye all theyr accyons and dedes vnto theyr naturall ende. But (carencia cognicio∣ne) Those thynges that lacke cognycyon haue no mocyon of themself / no∣ther be dyrected to theyr ende without the helpe of an other. As an arowe of hymself can not be mo¦ued ne dyrected vnto the prycke without the redy conueyaūce of hym that shoteth / thrugh whom dy¦rectly he attayneth his en¦de & is shotte to the pryc∣ke. In as moche thenne as mankynde is ordeyned vnto an ende / ferre exce∣dynge the lymytes of na¦ture / as it is wryten by ye holy ghost in (Ysay .lxiiij. Oculus non vidit. Deus abs{que} te que preparasti exspectantibus te. Et pri∣ma ad Corintheos secun∣do. Oculus non vidit nec aures audiuit / nec in cor hominis ascendit que pre parauit deus diligenti∣bus illum) The eye of a man hath not seen / no∣ther his eeres herde / no∣ther it can not be thought in his herte thende that almyghty god hath or∣deyned
for them that lo∣ueth hym. To this ende man hauynge the vse of reason and parfyte kno∣wlege is dyrected by his free wyll as by a pryncy¦pall in hymself to moue hym to god. And also by fayth as a prycypall a∣boue naturall knowlege without the whiche it is Impossyble for to please god and attayne to the ende of grace in this pre∣sent lyf and glory in he∣uen / as it is wryten (Si∣ne fide impossibile est pla¦cere deo) Whyle it is so that man endowed with vse of reason / hauynge naturall knowlege and free / may not suffycyente¦ly dyrecte hymself to the ende that god hath ordey¦ned to without the helpe of fayth. As it is wryten Iheremie .iiijo. (Non est enim hominis vincere ne∣{que} viri esse vt ambulet ei et dirigat gressus eius) ¶It is not in mannes power for to ouercome vyce of hymself / nother for to walke parfyghtly / and dyrecte his gooynge in the lawe of god / but by his grace assystente. Moche more those that ben childern for tender∣nesse of age and lacke of knowlege can not dyrecte theyr dedes conuenyente∣ly to that ende without specyall helpe of god. In token herof / childern ne∣wely sette to scole lackyn¦ge the vse of reason and the habyte of cognycyon haue a recourse to god∣des dyreccyon. Fyrste ler∣nynge this. Crystis crosse be my spede. And so be∣gynneth the (a.b.c) In wytnesse of defawte of this perfeccyon in know∣lege. Pyctagoras to the dyreccyon of childern he founde fyrste this letter
in the (a.b.c.Y.) the whi¦che as Ysyder sayth Ethi¦mologis is fourmed and made after the symylytu¦de of mānes lyf. For this letter .Y. is made of two lynes. One is a ryght ly¦ne / and the other is half ryght and half crokyd / And so verely the Infant age of a childe is ryght neyther dysposed to ver¦tue neyther to vyce as the phylosophre sayth (Tan¦quā tabula nuda in qua nichil depingitur) But the seconde age is called Adolescencia / and hath two lynes a ryght and a crokyd / sygnefyenge the dysposycyon that he hath thenne to vyce and then̄e to vertue. In the whiche age is the brekynge of euery childe or to goodnes or to lewdenes. Therfore that age is moost vncer¦tayn in knowlege as Sa¦lomon sayth (Prouerbio rū .xxxo. Tria sūt michi difficilia ad cognoscendū et quartū penitus ignoro Viam nauis in medio maris. et viam viri in a∣dolescentia) Thre thyn¦ges sayth Salomon ben harde to me to knowe / and the fourth vtterly I knowe not. The flyght of the Egle in the ayer / The waye of the serpent on the erthe. The sayl¦lynge of a shyppe in the see. But the fourth and moost hardest is to vnder¦stande the waye of a man in his growynge age / Tho childern thenne the whiche lacke dyscrecyon / vse of reason / & parfyght cognycyon / and yet attay¦ne to the ende that is pre¦pared for mannes blysse. As thyse blessyd Innocen¦tes whoos solempnyte we halowe this daye (Qui non loquendo sed morien¦do confessi sunt) May
moost in a specyall laude that gloryous lorde (Se∣quentes agnum quocū{que} ierit) To whom by our moder holy chirche / in ty∣tle of tryumphe may con¦tynually be applyed the wordes of my tyme (Lau¦date pueri dominum) Ye chosen childern of god lackynge the vse of cog∣nycyon / and yet gloryfy∣ed by your passyon in lyf euer lastynge prayse ye god. ¶ In the begynnynge thenne of this symple ex¦hortacyon / that I a chil∣de wantynge the habyte of connynge may be dy∣rected by hym / that gaue to that childe Danyell (Sermonē rectum et spi∣ritum deo{rum}) Somwhat to saye to his laude and praysynge / and to all pu∣re childern that ben here present edifyenge we shal atte this tyme deuoutly make our prayers. In the whiche prayers I re∣cōmende vnto your de∣uocyons the welfare of all Crystys chirche. Our holy fader the Pope with all the clergye / my lorde of Caunterbury / and the ryght reuerende fader & worshypfull lorde my bro¦der bysshopp of London your Dyocesan. Also for my worshypfull broder Deane of this cathedrall chirche with all resyden∣saryes & prebendaryes of the same. And moost In∣tyerly I praye you to ha∣ue myself in your specyal deuocyon / so that I may contynue in this degree that I now stande. And neuer more herafter to be vexed with Ieroms vysy¦on / the whiche is wryten. (Ieremie primo) Whan the good lorde asked of Ieremye (Quid tu vi∣des Ieremia) He answe∣red
& sayd (Virgam vi∣gilantem ego video) A waken rodde I see sayd Ieremye. Truely this waken rodde oftentymes hath troubled me in my childehode / that (lumbi mei impleti sunt illusio∣nibus et non est sanitas in carne mea. Afflictus sum et humiliat{us} sum ni∣mis) And therfor though I be now in hye dygny∣te / yet whan I see other here my mayster yt was thenne (Operuit confu∣sio faciem meam. A voce {con}tremuerūt labia mea) As Nero the Emperour wold to his mayster Se∣neca / the same wysshe I wolde to my mayster I loue so well / & for theyr true dylygence that all my maysters the whiche taught me ony connyn∣ge in my youthe gaue to me. I wolde that they we¦re promytted to be perpe∣tuall felowes and colle∣geners of that famouse college of the kynges foū¦dacyon in South werke / that men calle the kyn∣ges Benche / gretter wor¦shyppe I can not wysshe. than for to sytte in to the kynges owne benche / & for by cause Charyte is parfyght yf it be exten∣ded as well to the ende of the lyf as it is the lyf self. I wolde they sholde ende theyr lyf in that ho¦ly waye / the whiche often¦tymes I radde whan that I was Querester in the Marteloge of Poules / where many holy bodyes deyed / & is called in latyn (Via tiburtina) In En∣glysshe as moche to saye. as the hygh waye to Ty∣burne. In this behalf ye shall praye specyally for all prelates that co∣meth to theyr dygnytee as I dyde. For thanked
be god without conspyra¦cy lordshyp or symony I was sette in this degree / For verely promocyon in ony realme hadde (Per demonū. simonē et princi pem) hath & shall bryn∣ge Crystys chirche (in cō¦fusionē dampnabilem) ¶In the seconde partye ye shall praye for the we∣le and peas of all Cry∣sten reames / specyally for the reame of Englonde. Our souerayne lorde the kyng. Our souerayne la∣dy the quene. My lord the prynce. My lady the kyn∣ges moder. My lorde her husbonde / with all the lor¦des of the Realme. The welfare of this Cyte. For my ryght worshypful bro¦der and louer the Mayer with all the Aldermen. and Shyrefs. ¶In the thyrde partye all the sou∣les lyenge in the paynes of purgatory. Specyally for the soule of the reue∣rrnde fad{er} my lorde Tho¦mas kempe late bysshop And for the soules of all benefactours of this chir¦che of Poules / with all Crysten soules / for the whiche and for the entent premysed. I praye you de∣uoutly saye a (Pater nr̄) and an (Aue) Laudate pueri dn̄m. vt supra. ¶In as moche as Cry∣ste sayth in the Gospell. (Sinite peruulos venire ad me quia taliū est reg∣num celorum. Mathei. .xixo.) Suffre ye childern to come to me. For of su∣che the kyngdom of he∣uen is fulfylled / by whom after saynt Austyn (in o∣riginali vbi thema) It is not oonly vnderston∣de those that ben childern of age. But those that
ben childern pure in clen∣nesse from synne & ma∣lyce. As the holy appostle saynt Poule sayth (Noli∣te effici pueri sensib{us}. ma¦licia autem paruuli esto∣te. prima ad Corintheos xiiijo.) Be ye not childern in your wyttes / but from all synne and malyce / be ye childern in clennesse / And in this fourme all maner of people / and all maner of ages in clēnesse of lyf ought to be pure as childern / to whom ge∣nerally may I saye (Lau¦date pueri dn̄m. laudate pueri dn̄m in infancia. laudate dn̄m in adolescen¦cia. laudate dn̄m in per∣seuerante etate humana) Prayse ye childern your god in your Infant age / prayse ye hym in your gro¦wynge age / and prayse ye hym perseuerauntly. (Vs{que} in senectū et seniū) In your mannes age / And in thyse thre praysyn¦ge of thre ages shall stan¦de the processe of this sym¦ple collacyon. ¶Thyse thre ages after the consceyte of the ap∣postle (ad Galathas) and (ad Romanos) is lykened to the thre lawes That is to saye / to the lawe of kynde / the lawe wryten / and the lawe of grace. The fyrste age is lykened vnto the lawe of kynde. A childe fyrste whan he is in his Infant age is not constreyned vn¦to no lawes / he is not cor∣rected nother beten / and there is no defaute layde vnto hym / but vtterly he is lefte vnto the lawe of kynde. Do he what som∣euer he wyll / noo man doth blame hym. Moral∣ly the state of man jnme¦dyatly after synne was verely the state of childe∣hode
and Infans hauyn¦ge noo nouryce. Whan that man was vtterly left without ony expressyd la∣we / hauynge no mayster to his owne naturall In∣clynacyon / as to his la∣we / there was no lawe of god newe put to hym / Many defawtes dyde he and to many Inconue∣nyences he ranne. Cor∣reccyon was there none / but vtter destruccyon / as Noes flood destroyenge alle Infantes of man∣kynde saue .viij. persones (Genesis .vijo.) The de∣struccyon of Sodome & of Gomor with other cy∣tees (Genesis .xixo.) And lyke wyse as a childe ha∣uynge noo nouryce nor guyder deputed to hym may as well renne in to the fyre or water as to go besyde. Soo verely in the fyrste age of man in the lawe of kynde. A man beynge without a noury∣ce or guyder lefte to his naturall guydynge mys∣used soo ferre hymselfe that he ranne to water / where he was vtterly de∣stroyed as I sayd before / saue Noes housholde / and also to the fyre whe∣re a grete parte was de∣stroyed. And verely may∣sters yf we clerely consy∣dre our lyf and state that we stande in now in thyse dayes I fere me we shall fynde our self soo ferre guyded by our sensuall nature that we shall ne∣de to be purefyed to our streyte correccyon with a streyte afflyccyon / as the water or the fyre / and all for lacke of our maysters and nouryces all wrap∣ped in neclygence taketh none attendaunce to vs / Our maysters and nou∣ryce spyrytuall (Querent{ur} que sua sunt. Et non que
ihesu xp̄i. sunt canes mu∣ti non valentes latrare / Ysaye .lvio.) Our tempo∣rall rulers (Infideles socij furum diligunt mu∣nera sequunt{ur} retribucōis pupillo nō iudicant cau∣sa vidue non ingreditur ad cos. Ysaye .io.) This neclygence in our noury∣ces spyrytuall and tem∣porall causeth in the chir∣che Insolent lyf seculer cō¦uersacyon (In habitu in¦teriori et exteriori vt qua∣lis populus talis sit et sa cerdos) In the temporal∣te it causeth yt manslaugh¦ter is not sette by / leche∣ry is pleasure / robbery & dysceyte is called cheue∣saunce / extorcyon lord∣shyp / power / falsehede / a fete of wytte / vsury coun¦ted no synne (Quomodo facta est meretrix ciuitas fidelis plena iudicij. Ius∣ticia habitauit in ea. nūc autem homicide. Argen¦tū tuū versum est in sco∣riam. vinū tuum mixtū est aqua. Ysaye .io.) A mer¦ueyllous chaunge / somty¦me our reame was pros∣perous / now it is in my¦sery / somtyme ryghtwys¦nesse was the chyef ruler. now falshede is quarter mayster / somtyme was Inhabytaunt peas loue & charyte / now wrathe and manslaughter / and false dyssymulacyon. Somty¦me trouth was mayster of our marchaūtes (nūc vero vsure et dolus) And somtyme trouth stode vp ryght / now he is fallen / Good men haue Inser¦ched the strete where he felle. Some sayd he felle in Lombarde strete / some sayd in Buklars bury / & whan it was vtterly kno¦we / he was fallen in euery strete (Veritas corruit in plateis) The cause is no¦ne other but we lacke our
maysters & guyders that sholde streytly attende in this Infant age of condy¦cyon that we ben in. ¶Whan that Infant a∣ge is ended / the fader pro¦uydeth for his childe / for a mayster the whiche gy∣ueth Instruccyon in smal doctrynes / as in his Do∣nate. Partes of reason / and suche other / the whi∣che mayster comunely is called Pedagogis in la∣tyn. This mayster gy∣ueth cōmaundementes to the childe in his growyn∣ge age And he breke them he is sharpely corrected / there is no fawte that he doth but he is punysshed. Somtyme he wryngeth hym by the eeres / somty∣me he gyueth hym a stry∣pe on the honde with the ferell / some tyme beteth hym sharpely with the rodde. And so with com∣maūdementes and shar∣pe correccyon he gyueth hym full Instruccyon in the lawer scyence. So in lyke maner after the la∣we of kynde. As mankyn¦de grewe in age / almygh∣ty god prouyded to man an enfourmer that was called Moyses / the whi∣che sholde teche man his pryncypalles and small and rude doctrynes. And so the olde lawe taught to man his Donate and Partes of reason. Also he taught hym how he shol∣de gyue to god his par∣tes / the whiche were sa∣crefyces / oblacyons / and tythes Iustely and truely to be gyuen to god / as it is wryten (Ecclesiasticis .xxxvo.. Da altissimo se∣cundum donatum eius) That what thou shol∣dest gyue to thy neygh∣bour and broder his par∣tes. That is for to saye /
Almesdedes freely with∣out grutchynge. Lenynge of thy good without ony trust or hope of vsury / & forgeuȳge thy neyghbour yf he be in necessyte with out trouble for goddes sa¦ke. And lyke wyse as the people vnder Moyses gro¦wynge in childhode / thy∣se thynges were taught by the whiche specyally goddes lawe & praysynge was encreaced. So in our growynge age in vertue that good lorde (cui{us} laus est in ecclia scō{rum}) can not be better praysed than yf we gyue vnto hym Iustly & truely his donat / to hȳ oblacyons sacrefyces and tythes. To our neygh∣bour mercyfully geue our almesse. And pyteuously forgyue offences & dettes to theym that ben nedy & may not paye. Thyse ben the thynges that longeth to goddes praysynge in mankyndes childehode / as it is wryten of Thoby (Thobie prio. Hec et his similia puerulus secundū legem obseruabant) In Moyses tyme streyte cō∣maūdement{is} were gyuen to man / streyte punysshe∣mentes / & sharpe correccy¦ons / they were taken by the eere streytly / whan it cōmaunded in the lawe / (Aurem {pro} aure. dentē {pro} dente) without ony mer∣cy / he that gadred styckes on the Sabot daye was stoned vnto the deth. And for one grutched ayenst theyr mayster Moyses / yt whiche was but Pedago∣gus / the chosen woman moost accept Maria Aa∣rons syster was smytten of god with the Infyrmy¦te of leprehode. How ofte¦tymes breke we our holy daye / how oftymes grut∣che we ayenst our mays∣ters / not holdynge vs con¦tente
with noo kyng no∣ther prynce / archebysshop nor bysshop. Beynge as varyaunt as the mone / & yet the good lorde spared vs. The olde lawe was harde to obserue / in the whiche tyme god entrea∣ted mankynde after his wrathe & punysshement / Wherfore he was called (de{us} vlcionū) For whoos delyuer mercy cryed to al¦myghty god to sende mā∣kynde a newe mayster yt sholde entreate hym and teche more curtously & it lyked hym (Non ex operi¦bus iusticie q̄ fecim{us} nos. sed secundū suā misericor¦diā. ad Titū .iijo.) To co¦me downe hymself / & to∣ke on hym our mortally∣te / gaue vs a newe lawe / wolde suffre none but hȳ¦selfe to be our mayster / Wherwith all loue & be∣nygnyte without sharpe∣nesse he taught vs. Noo rude nother grose erthely doctrynes / as they were taught in the olde lawe. But he taught vs sub∣tyll thynges / heuenly dy∣uynytee / our glorye & our blysse (Docebat eos de regno dei) And as lon∣ge as we ben in the scole of mercyfull benygnytee & gentylnesse / though we do fawtes purposynge to amende. So longe he a∣bydeth vs pacyently hol∣dynge hymself contente / For by cause we ben now in mannes state and par∣fyght age with our owne correccyon (Propterea ex¦pectat deus vt misereatur vestri. Ysaye .xxxo.) And yf we dyfferre & wyll not correcte our selfe here in the scole of mercy / ful gre¦uously & moost sharpely shall we abyde the swer∣de of correccyon of his ryghtwysnesse / as dayly by experyence we may fe∣le.
Therfore in the thre ages of our lyfe lete vs besye our selfe to prayse god with pure childern. Amendynge our lyfe by dedes of penaunce. And vertuous dedes vsynge. exhortynge you with the wordes of my tyme (Lau¦date pueri dn̄m) ¶ The fourme and the maner how that we shol¦de worshyp and loue al∣myghty god in the thre ages / that is to saye. In childehode. Yongthe / and Manhode. Is shewed to vs by a prety conceyte of our comyn kalender / in euery boke of seruyce. Ye shall vnderstande that e∣uery moneth noted in the kalender is dyuyded in thre partyes. That is to saye (Kalendas. Nonas and Ydus) ¶The fyrst daye of euery moneth is called & named Kalendas The seconde is named not Kalendas / but Quar¦to Quinto or Sexto No∣nas. And so tyll ye come to Nonas. And after No∣nas the dayes ben named Ydus tyll ye come to the myddell / & thenne all the moneth after named Ka¦lendas after certayn nom¦bres as the myddes of the moneth is nameth .xix. o∣ther .xviij. Kalendas coū∣tynge lesse tyll ye come to the ende. ¶Morally by thyse thre. Kalendas. No¦nas & Ydus / is vnderstan¦de the thre ages of man. By Kalendas is vnder∣stande childehode. Kalen¦de is as moche to saye (Quasi colendo) For the consuetude of the Romay¦nes was the fyrste daye of the moneth / that is cal¦led Kalendas / falleth to solempnyse to theyr god∣des Hely Iuno & Iupy∣ter.
So verely the childe∣hode of man is dedycate to deuocyon / thenne sette the faders the childern to scole. And thenne be they taught to serue god / & to saye grace / to helpe the preest to synge / for to be meke gentyll and lowely Thenne saye they our la¦dy matens & ben ryght de¦uoute. Of whom may be verefyed that is wryten by Dauyd (Hec est gene∣racio querenciū dn̄m) yt is the generacyon that be sely by deuocyon seke al∣myghty god. ¶By the se¦conde daye that is called Nonas I vnderstande the seconde age that is called (Iuuentus) youthe (Non dicunt{ur} quasi nulle) For in yt daye the Romayns worshypt no goddes / no∣ther in yt season was noo festyuall dayes / or elles (None dicunt{ur} quasi nūdi¦ne) As moche to saye as a fayer. For in that tyme they occupyed themself in fayers & marchaūdyses / And herto conuenyently may be ye youthe of man applyed / that is in specy∣all from .xiiij. yeres vnto .xviij. In the whiche he is full of vndeuocyon / & all moost forgeteth to wor∣shyp his god or ony saynt And yf he do it with his mouth / his herte is full ferre frō god about worl∣dly vanytees / as it is wry¦ten (Populus hic labijs me honorat / cor autē eo{rum} longe ē a me. Ysay .xxixo.) Congruently also youth may be named (None .i. nundine) a fayer or mar¦ket. For in this age is the marchaundyse of the de∣uyll. The worlde habun¦daūtly bought. Here the yonge man byeth a strō∣pettes body for his body and soule. Here all vayne marchaūdyses of ye worl∣de
ben bought / to the whi¦che is very prone / & redy our youthe of Englonde as we may see dayly / ther is no vanyte in no partye of the worlde but we ben redy to bye it. Longe he∣res and shorte collers of Almayns. Euyll fasshe∣ned garmentes / & deuyl∣lysshe shoon & slyppers of Frensmen. powches and paynted gyrdels of Spay¦nardes / newe foūde hat∣tes of Romayns. And so is fulfylled the wordes of our lorde wryten in holy scrypture (Ieremie .xio. Elongauerūt a me & am¦bulauerūt post vanitatē et vani facti sunt) This youthe sayth our lorde hath ferre put hymselfe fro me / & they haue wal∣ked after theyr owne va∣nytees / & by theyr Inuen∣cyons they ben all vayne & vndoubted. This alte∣rable vanytees in garmē∣tes is a true argument & a faythfull conclusyon to all wyse straūgers That Englysshmen be as chaū¦gable in theyr maners & wyttes as they be in out∣warde garmentes. And yf this vayne marchaū∣dyse were oonly in youth of the reame it were more tollerable / but (inuetera¦ti dierū malo{rum}) Boyes of fyfty yere of age are as newe fangled as ony yonge men be. The whi∣che by reason sholde tor∣ne theyr face from ye worl¦de consyderynge the ende of theyr lyf. But lytell yt is consydered / ye rather in theyr vanytees the ben praysed (Quoniā lauda¦tur peccator in desiderns aīe sue et iniquis benedi∣cetur. Psalmo &c. ¶And the thyrde daye is called Ydus / the whiche is as moche to say as (diuisio) a departynge. By whom
I vnderstande the latter age of man / in the whi∣che man is dyuyded from the worlde by deth to the ende for to receyue good or euyll as he hath deser¦ued in this presente lyfe. ¶Lyke wyse thenne as in the fyrste parte of the moneth there is but one daye that is called Kalen¦de / the whiche is the fyrst daye of all. But in the later ende there be many dayes that ben named of the worde Kalendas. So in cōparyson of the fyrst daye of thy lyf / that is to saye of thy childehode in the whiche thou were wel dysposed in deuocyon / Multeplye thy good lyf and holy dysposycyon in thy latter dayes / that yu mayst deserue our lordes mercy / sayenge with the prophete in the sawter / (Et senectus mea in mi∣sericordia vberi) ¶And how be it thou hast often before in thy yonge age & myddell age dyuyded thy lyf. Somtyme to ver¦tue / somtyme to vyce. Ye as now in thy latter age kepe thy lyf holy in ver∣tue. Dyuyde it nomore tyll deth dyuyde it after the coūseylles of the gos∣pelles (Ioh̄es xix. Non scindam{us} eam sed sorcia∣mur de ea cui{us} sit) Lete vs not cutte it / but lete vs drawe lottes whoos it shall be. How be it this texte after the letter is vn¦derstande of Crystys cote without . Yet conue∣nyently it may be vnder∣stande of euery mannes lyf or soule (Tunica di∣cit{ur} quasi tua vnica) Whe¦ther is more surer thyne owne than thy soule / for the whiche prayeth ye pro¦phete sayenge (Erue a framea deus alam meā. et de manu canis vnicā
meā) And whyle it is so that man lyueth here in two lyues / & lyuynge af∣ter ye pleasur of the worl∣de / the tother lyuynge he∣re in vertue by grace to co¦me to blysse / tho that wol gyue one partye of theyr lyf to vyces / & an other to vertue / and specyally in theyr age. Thyse maner of men dyuyde theyr cote And they nother all the tayllers in ye worlde shall neuer make it hole ayen. For as saȳt Ierom sayth in a pystle (Difficile ym∣mo impossibile est vt q̄s in p̄senti et in futuro frua¦tur gaudijs vt hic ventrē et ibi mentē. et de deliciis transiat) It is harde ye it is Impossyble that a man may haue all Ioye in this worlde & also in heuen / here to fylle his body & there to fylle his mynde. For truly the dely¦tes of this worlde and the Ioyes of heuen can neuer be togyder in one cote of thy soule. Wherfore yf thy cote of thy soule be o∣nes hoole in vertue with∣out ony seme of vyce / de∣parte it neuer but lete it retorne (in sortēdm̄) And contynue thy lyf in good¦nesse without ony Inter∣rupcyon. And lyke wyse as in thy childehode thou begannest vertue oonly / where thrugh in that age thou prayseste almyghty god / so in thy myddel age all wanton vanytees lay∣de a parte encresse thy ver¦tue / as tho dyde of whom it is wryten (Ibūt de vir¦tute in virutē quous{que} vé¦deat{ur} deus) And that the ende may be conformable to his pryncyple without dyuysyon folowynge the wayes of Innocency with thyse holy Innocentes.
