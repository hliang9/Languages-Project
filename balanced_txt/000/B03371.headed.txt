The Frantick 'Squire: Whose passionate Love for a Young Lady caused his Distraction, and since the restoration, of his Senses, he, with his own hand, writ this Excellent new Ditty. To the Tune of Let Mary live long. MElpomene now assist a meek Lover, whose Tears will discover, How false to her Vow fair Cynthia hath been; While I sigh and complain She return'd me disdain, and would not expel My languishing passion, My languishing passion, but bid me farewel. From morning to night, I wander'd distracted ah! what have I acted Which made her delight to torture me so: Through the Shades did I post, Like a hovering Ghost bereaved of rest; With sad Lamentation, With sad Lamentation, in sorrows opprest. My Riches I left, with dear Habitation, each Friend and Relation, Of Comforts bereft, Distracted I run; That a place I might find That was free from mankind, (fair women I mean;) Whose conquering Beauty, Whose conquering Beauty, too late I have seen. My Pillow I made on banks of green Rushes, near Brambles and Bushes, Where weeping I laid my sorrowful Head; As I closed my Eyes, The kind watery Skies, would weep to behold A Lover exposed A Lover exposed to sorrow and cold. I valu'd not Crowns, with Kingdoms of Treasure, and wealth out of measure, Or fortifi'd Towns, for which they contend; There was Cynthia my Love, Which I valu'd above an Emperor's Throne, Her amorous beauty, Her amorous beauty, was Riches alone. To Bedlam bound, at length they convey'd me, And there having laid me Vpon the hard Ground, I took my repose; And my rich silken Bed, Where I once laid my Head, was turned to Straws▪ Of this my Distraction, Of this my Distraction, was Cynthia the Cause? My Senses once more, the hand of kind Heaven▪ in pity hath given, And now I'll adore no woman alive: Since my Heart is at ease, Let 'em frown if they please I scorn their disdain, They never shall make me, They never shall make me, a Captive again.
