THE Country Gentleman; Or, the happy Life. To an excellent Tune, Or, Hey boys up go we. With Allowance. I Am a man of Wealth and Land, and Gold I have good store, A good Estate I now command, what can one wish for more? I value not an hundred pound, to Tenants i'le be kind, I'le have my Hawk, and have my Hound and such delights will mind. To London I will not repair, here sweeter pleasures be, I live in a more healthy Ayr, and fairer Beauties see: I love the noise of Hey-ge-ho, the whistling at the Plough, The Baaing of the tender Yoe, and Lowing of the Cow. The morning Lark which shepherds love here sings by break of day; And Nightingale in yonder Grove where Flowers perfume our way: Fair Siccamores to please the eye, and hinder too much heat, And Strawberries and Violets lye all round about our feet. BEtimes we hear the huntsmans horn which loudly ecchoes round, And in a lovely Rosie morn how sweetly does it sound! The drowsie sluggard strait gives ear, his golden Dreams are fled; (Except the Sick) who e're did hear the Horn and lye a bed? Intrigues of State here are not known, nor Beauties nice and coy, Each man well pleas'd with what's his own his pleasures does enjoy: At night within his Wifes soft Arms the happy Swain does rest, And thus secure, and void of harms with Peace is alwaies blest. I hate the many Cheats and Knaves that lurk in London Town, whose restless heads like tumbling waves are rowling up and down: Ambitious Fops find little ease, let us Ambition shun, And mark how all our Flowers and trees are guilded by the Sun. The meanest Shepherd does enjoy some Milk-maid brisk and fair, And gets first night a thumping Boy, a lusty jolly Heir. Let painted Iilts avoid this place, for all our Nymphs so gay With only Dews do wash their face, and look divine as day. FINIS. LONDON, Printed for J. Clark, VV. Thackeray, and T. Passinger.
