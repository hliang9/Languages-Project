AN AVNSVVER TO GEORGE GIFFORDS PRETENDED DEFENCE OF READ PRAYERS AND DEVI∣sed Leitourgies with the vngodly cauils and vvicked sclanders comprised in the first part of his book entituled, A SHORT TREATISE against the Donatists of England. BY IOHN GREENWOOD CHRISTS POORE AFFLICTED prisoner in the Fleete at London, for the trueth of the gospel. 1590.
To the Christian Reader / grace and peace from God our Fa∣ther and Iesus Christ our Lord. BEcause Prayer vnto God is a most Christian exercise and fruit of faith / being rightly vsed: having so many commaundements and promises concerning it in the Scripture: by which we come most neare vnto God / as in any other part of his worship / speaking to him (as it were) mouth to mouth / when we lift vp our hearts and powre forth our requests vnto the Lord: it was thougt needfull / seing these latter Treatises of Mr. Greenwoods towching this Argumēt are now published agayne / ād his first concerning it can∣not be had / here therefore to note downe briefly a few things both cō∣cerning the doctrine ād right vse of praier: ād in particular concerning read prayer / by meanes whereof it is come to passe that true praier is so much vnknowē / neglected / ād profaned. And this we pray thee (Chri¦stian Reader) to take in good part / and to examine vp the word of God / which is the onely rule of truth / and light of our feet in the darknes of this World. Prayer is the lifting vp off the heart vnto God / to call vpon his na∣me / with faith / by the work and help of his Spirit. Psal. 25.1. Rom. 10 1;.14. Mat. 21.22. Rom. 8.26.27. Praier is eyther with words / or without words. With words / being vttered in speach / eyther publickly or privately: eyther in mo or fewer words: yet alway briefly: according o the present and severall occasiōs. Exod. 32.11.12.13. Ezra. 9.6.15 / 2. am. 7.18.29. and 15.31. Mat. 26.39 Ioh. 17. chap. Act. 1.24.25. and 4.24.30. Heb. 13.15. Without words / being conceyved onely in the mynd / and so presented before the Lord who knoweth the thoughts and secrets of the heart. Exod. 14.15 / . Sam. 1.12.13. Esa. 38.14. Prayer is eyther Request or Thankesgiving. Both these are eyther for our selves / or for others. Request for our selves / is deprecatiō or sup¦plication: for others / intercession. 1. Tim. 2.1. Deprecation is for some evill to be kept or removed by the Lord frō vs. Mat. 6.13. and 8.24.25. Psal. 70. Gen. 32.9.12 / 2. Cor. 12.8. Iā. .13. Supplication is for some good thing to be graunted or cōtinewed of God vnto vs. Mat. 6.9.12. Gen. 24.12. Exod. 33.12.13. Psal. 4.6. Luk. 11.13. and 17.5. Intercession is for others / eyther for some good to be given / or some evill to be taken from them. Mat. 6.9.11.12. and 5.44. Exod. 32.11.12. 13. Ephes. 6.18.19.20. Rom. 15.30.31.32. Iam. 5.14.18 / 1. Ioh. 5.16.
Thankesgiving is the yeelding of praise and thāks vnto God for his mercy and benefits eyther given or promised. M.. 69.13. Gen. 24.27. Exo. 15.1.21. Psa. 69.29.36. ād 103.1.5: Ioh. 11.41. 1. Tim. 1.17. Re. 7.1 Prayer is to be made alwayes and onely in the Mediation of Christ. Ioh. 14.13.14.1. Tim. 2.5. Not that this need alway to be mentioned / but that we ought alway to come before God and present our selves / and our prayers vnto him with faith in the Mediation of Christ  by whom alone / we and al our sacrifices are made acceptable vnto God. For in him are all the promises of God yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. Through him are all the graces ād mercyes of God conveyed vnto vs Ioh. 1.16. Ephes. 4.7. By his Mediatiō our prayers being presented be∣fore his Father / all the weaknes / want of faith love hope / ād any other corruption wherewith our prayers (as they proceed from vs) be distey¦ned / are covered and taken away. Because he putteth the sweet odour of his Mediation vnto our prayers / and so presenting them to his Fa∣ther / they are accepted of him. Rev. 8.3.4. with Exod. 30.7.8. Psal. 141.2 Mar. 9.22.23.24 / 1. Pet. 2.5. For this cause therefore / must prayer / in faith / alway respect Gods promise / and Christs Mediation. Mar. 11.24. Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34. Heb: 7.25. and 9.24. And for the same cause / must the person that pray∣eth first be accepted of God in Christ / before their prayers and sacrifi∣ces can be approved. Rev. 1.5.6 / 1. Pet. 2.5. Prov. 15.8, Hag. 2.13.14.15. Gen. 4.3.4.5. and 6.8. and 8.20.21. with Heb. 11.4.7. Wherevpon we are bound to be carefull / first our selves to be in the true faith and Church of Christ / vnder his Mediation / that we may our selves be accepted of the Father in him: and then in faith to offer our prayers / both for mat∣ter and maner / so as we have warrant by the word of God / that he wil heare vs / ād that Christ will be our Mediatour / therein. For which see the Scriptures a foresaid: and Mat. 6.9 Ephes. 2.19. and 4.4.5.6. Act. 2.41.47. Exo. 30.9. Levi. 17.3.7. Deut. 12.5.8. Psal. 16.4. and 50.8.14.16 17.23. Esa. 1.12. etc. Mal. 1.14 / 1. Tim. 2.1.2.5.8. Iam. 1.5.8. Iohn 5. 13.14. Rev. 8.3.4. For our better direction and assurance herein / hath Christ givē that forme of prayer / which is commonly called the Lords prayer. Mat. 6. 9.13. Luk. 14.1.2.3.4. Where he hath prescribed a direction for the fra∣ming of all our prayers both for matter and maner according to that rule. For in it we are taught / as towching the matter of all our pray∣ers / that they be for things first and chiefly concerning Gods glory / and then concerning our good / so as will stand with the glory of God. Ioh. 12.27.28. And towching the maner of prayer / that it be in faith hope and love / with reverence / briefly and humbly propounded / that he in al may be glorifyed. In faith (I say) both of Gods willingnes to heare ād help / as being our Father in Christ / ād of his ability therevnto as being in heaven able to do whatsoever he will. Esa. 63.16. Psal. 115.3. In ho∣pe / of his mercy and favour towards vs / he being our Father and we his children in Christ. Luc. 11.9.13. In love both off God and one off
another / in Christ. Psa. 116.1. Mar. 11.25.26. Act. 4.24. With reverēce / as coming before our heavenly Father / who is full off glory and Ma∣jesty / he in heaven / we on earth etc. And therefore also ought our pray∣ers briefly and hunbly to be propounded: not seking after long or affec∣ted speach / nor vsing vayne repetitions etc. Mat. 6.7.8.9. Genes. 18.27. Exood. 34.8.9. Ecclesiast. 5.1. And note here / that Christ hath propounded this direction / not by way off exhortation or doctrine / as in other cases he was woont / but in forme off petitions / and those very brieff: Least otherwise we should have doubted that we might not with such confidence in few words have spoken directly vnto God himselff: but that we must have vsed ei∣ther mediatours for vs / as the Papists / or sighs onely without words as the Anabaptists / or never ceasing from prayer / as the Eutychians / or at least some long circustāce off words ād great affectatiō of speach or the like / as ignorance / superstition / and hypocrisy are ready to lead vnto. Finally / in this forme off prayer / by Christ we are taught / that the end and scope off all our prayers / ought to be the glory God in Christ. And that therefore we pray alway / with submission off our selves and our requests vnto his will / who being King and Lord ouer all / know∣eth and will performe what he seeth best for his glory and our good. Mat. 6.13. And thus prayer conceyved or vttered in five words / is better then ten thousand otherwise / as the Apostle speaketh of prayer in another case / 1. Cor. 14.19. Now the help which God hath promised ād giueth vnto vs in praier is his Spirit. Which is as the fyer / quickning and stirring vp our spi∣rit to and in prayer: given of God vnto vs for the helping off our infir∣mityes / that we by it in faith should call vpon the Lord our Father in Christ: Rom. 8.26.27. Gal. 4.6. with Exod. 30.7.8. And this fitly agreeth with the nature of God / who as he is a Spirit in himselff / so wil he off vs be worshipped in Spirit and truth. Ioh. 4.24. Ephes. 6.18. Other helps as off praying vpō a book / or of beads / or the like / read we not any appointed by God. Many tymes in deed we read in the Scripture off the prayers off the faithfull made to the Lord / but never off any one that read their prayers vpon a book or reckned them vpon beads etc. And no marvell / seing the Lord did never eyther commaund to vse / or promise to accept such service off him. Therefore must it needs be / that book prayers / etc. are an invention off man / and a vayne worship off GOD. Exod. 20.4.5.6. Esaie 29.13. Matthe. 15.9. Neyther can this stand with the nature and dutyes off prayer / befo∣re mentioned: But in deed breedeth and nourisheth both ignorance and neglect off true prayer / as by lamentable experience may be seen.
But into this poynt we will not now further enter / seing it is sufficiēt∣ly handled in these Treatises which were purposely written concer∣ning it. Onely because Mr. Henry Barrow (who was Mr. Greēwoods fellow prisoner and fellow Martyr) hath also written of this point / and namely cōcerning the book of cōmō prayer particularly in some books of his / which now are scant to be gotten / we thought it good likewise / from thence to annex these few lynes following cōcerning it. Mr. Bar¦row therefore in his discovery of the false Church / speaking of the book of common prayer / writeth thus: Pag. 64.65.66.67. This book / in that it standeth a publick prescript continewed Lei∣turgy / as iff it were the best that ever was devised by mortall man / yet in this place ād vse / being brought into the Church / yea or into any pri∣vate house / yt becometh a detestable idol / standing for that yt is not in the Church of God and consciences of men: namely / for holy / spirituall / and faithfull prayer / yt being nothing lesse / but rather abhominable ād lothsome sacrifice in the sight of God / even as a dead dogg,Levi. 1.2.3 / 4. Chapt. Now vnder the law / might neither any corrupt or any vnlawful sacrifice / with any sene blemish / be offred at the Altar / nether any part of any beast (though whiles / yt liued never so sufficiēt) being slayne before yt be brought vnto the Altar / yt was abhomination vnto the Lord: Euerie sacrifice must be brought quick ād new vnto the Altar / ād there be slayne everie mor∣ning and euening:1. Cor. 6 / 19. 1. Petri 2 / 5. . 21:10. om. 12.1. how much more in this spiritual Temple of God / where the offringes are spiritual / and God hath made al his servātes Kings / ād priestes / to offer vp acceptable sacrifices vnto him / through Iesus Christ / who hath thervnto givē thē his holy spirit into their he∣arts / to helpe their infirmities / ād teach thē to crie Abba Father.Rom. 8 / 26.15. Ephe. 4 7.8 / etc. How much more hath he which ascended / givē graces to those his servantes (whome he vseth in such high seruices) to the repairing of the Saintes / the worke of the ministerie / and the edificatiō of the church? vnto who∣me God vseth thē / as his mouth: the Church againe on the other side / vseth thē as their mouth vnto the Lord.Isa. 28 / 9. etc. Hebr. 5.13 Shal we think that God hath any time left these his servantes so singly furnished and destitute off his grace / they cannot find words according to their necessityes and faith / to expresse their wantes and desires / but need thus to be taught line vnto line / as children new weaned from the brestes / what and whē to say / how much to say / and when to make an end / to say this collect at the beginning / that at the end / that before / the tother after / this in the morning / that at after noone etc. How like children / or rather like mas∣king fooles are these great clarkes dressed? / Corin. 3 / 2 shew they not hereby / that either they have no faith / or els are such infantes / as they haue more need to be fed / thē to divide the portion vnto others?Heb. 4 / 16 2 / Eph. 3 / 12 Know they trow we / what prayer or the spirit of God meaneth? Prayer I take to be a confident demanding which faith maketh thorow the holy Ghost / ac∣cording to the wil of God / for their present wātes / estate etc. How now ca any read / prescript / stinted Leitourgie, which was pēned many yea∣res or daies before / be said a powring forth of the heart vnto the Lord?
or those faithful requestes which are stirred vp in them / by the holy Ghost / accordingl to their present wantes and estate of their heartes / or Church?1 Iohn. 2 / . Ephes. 6 / 18. Phil. 4 / 6 The whole book of Psalmes Lament. 3.40.41. Ioel  / 14 Moses 14 / . Prov. 4 / 18 / 19. Luke 11 / 2 / vnlesse they can say / that their heartes and Church stād in the same estate now / and so still to their liues end shal cōtinue / without either further increase or decrease / change or alteratiō / as they did thē: yea / that their childerēs childrē shal also so cōtinue / to whome they lea∣ve and incommend this Leitourgie, vnto the worldes end. What a strā∣ge estate is this / that alwaies thus standeth / at a stay? The way of the righteous (Solomon saith) shineth as / the light / that shineth more and more vnto the perfect day: as on the contrarie / the way of the wicked is as the darknes / they know not wherin they shall fall. Our Sauiour Christ saith / that if we gather not / we scatter.1 Petri 2 / 2 Ephes. 4 / 13. The Apostle Peter willeth the new borne babes to desire the sincere milke of the word / that they may grow therby: vntil they come to the measure of the age of the ful∣nes of Christ saith the Apostle Paul. Now then if they and their church increase not in the measure of knowledg / grace / holines / etc. yt is an in∣fallible signe that they haue not the Spirit of God. If they do increase why thē is not God served with his owne best giftes? Is not the iudg¦mēt of the Prophet thē vpō thē / wich saith / cursed be the deceiuer / with hath in his flok a male / yet voweth ād sacrificeth vnto the Lord a cor∣rupt thing.Mala. 1 / 14. Is this old rottē leitourgis their new sōgs they sing vnto te Lord with ād for his graces? May such old writtē rottē stuffe be called prayer / the odours of the Saintes / burnt with that heavenly fire of the Altar / the lively graces of the Spirit etc. may reading be said praying? may such apocrypha trumperie be brought into the Church off God / and there be read / reverenced ād receaued / as the sacred word of God? thrust vpon mens consciences / yea vpon God himself whether he wil or no? Is not this presūptuously to vndertake to teach the spirit of God? and to take away his office / which (as hath beene said) instructeth al the children of God to pray / evē with inward sighes and grones in expres∣sable / and giueth both wordes ād vtterāce / yea and (as the Apostle Ihon saieth) we need no other teacher to these thinges / then that annointing which we have receaved / and dwelleth in vs.Rō 8 / 26 / 27 1 / Ioh. 2 / 27 Is not this) if they wil haue their written stuffe to be held and vsed as prayer) to bind the holy Ghost to the froth and leaven of their lips / as yt were to the holy word of God? Is it not vtterly to quench and extinguish the spirit off God / both in the ministerie and people / whiles they tye both thē and God to their stinted numbred praiers? Is this the vnitie and vniformitie that ought to be in al Churches? and is amongst al Christes servantes / to make thē agree in a stinking patcherie devised apocrypha leitorgie, good for nothing but for cush∣sions and pillowes for the idle priestes / and profane carnal Atheistes to rock them a sleepe and keep them in securitie / wherby the conscience is no way either touched / edified / or bettered? Truly I am ashamed to think / much more to write of so grosse and filthie abhominacion / so ge∣nerally receaved / even of al estates / of these partes of the world / who
have by a popish custom and traditiō receaued yt one off / and from an other / without any warrant from the word. For the Apostles (I am sure) these maister builders / haue left no such president in / or commāde∣ment vnto the churches / neither giuen them any such power to bring in or set vp any such apocrypha Lyturgie in the church of God.1. Tim. 2.1. Hebr. 13.15. Ephes. 6.18 Philip. 4 / 6 1. Cor. 14 / 15 Iohn. 4.24 They alwaies vsed spiritual praiers according to their present wātes and oc∣casions / and so taught all churches to pray / alwaies / with al maner off praier ond supplication in the spirit / and therby to make knowen their wantes / and shew their requestes in al thinges vnto God their heauēly father: Our Sauiour Christ also / he taugt his disciples / that God is a Spirit / and wil be worshipped in spirit and truth. He hath likewise set downe most excellent rules / and a most absolute forme for al praiers in that part of scripture Mat. 6.9.10.11.12.13. commōly (but falsly) called the Lords praier: wherin he hath most notably instructed / directed / ād restrained our ignorant and inordinate desires / to those excellent hea∣des. In which / whatsoeuer is needful for vs to desire / or lawful for vs to pray / is in some one or other of those brāches included: euerie one off the being a base and foundatiō / wherevpō and wherby to frame many millions of seueral peticions / according to the seueral wātes and occa∣sions / at such several times as the saintes haue cause to pray. They are al of thē / so many euerrunning fountaines from which Godes seruātes by the holy Ghost / deriue and draw cōtinually fresh ād new graces: ād are al together such an abisme and vnmeasured ea of wisdome / from which al Christes seruātes thorough the world / haue alwaies fetched all their knowledg / graces / confort / and assurance of ād in their praiers (according to the capacitie of the vessel of their faith) some more / some lesse / al some / yet haue not al of thē together / much lesse any one of thē is able in the litle dish of his shallow vnderstāding / to comprise the vn∣measurable depth and greatnes of this Ocean of al wisdome ād grace. Wherby yt is euidēt / as also by the circumstāces and maner of deliue∣ring the same by our Sauiour Christ / by his Apostles / Disciples and Churches spiritual vse of praier according to their present estate and wantes / that these prescript wordes were not giuen or inioyned as a prescript praier / so to be vsed by any / even the wisest / much lesse the sim¦pler / vnbroken vp / vnexpounded / etc. so much as a compendious sum∣marie of al necessarie knowledg / ād rules for al praier / gathered (by the Author of all wisdome) into a brief / for the direction and instruction of our weaknes and ignorance. Of which endes ād vses / whiles some are ignorāt / or rather (as their grosse idolatrie / carnal dulnes / and superstitious presumptiō sheweth) are ignorant either what faithful praier / or the spirit of God is: whiles they both popishly abuse this Scripture as a principal collect in their publike leitourgie / with their oftē and idle repetition therof / fiue times in their morrow masse / etc. and / also through this abuse they grow fur∣ther bold to mould a new calfe / a new Leitourgie of their owne / and set that vp also in the church of God / as they count yt.
Yf yt were granted thē / that this scripture / and sundry psalmes / and other scriptures they alledg out of the prophetts / were cōmanded and enioyned to be read and vsed / as / and for the very praiers of the church and of the Saintes (then which nothing can be more false or grosly fond to conceaue) yet which way (if this were granted them) can they hereby proue yt lawful for them to bring in thir owe apocrypha deuises / ād set them vp in the church as ād with the holy canonical word of God? May their stinking filth be compared or placed with the heauēly liue∣ly word of God / without vsufferable blasphemie? may the froth of their lips / and follie of their heartes be thrust vpon mens consciences / yea euen vpon the Spirit of God himself in this maner? In the church of God may nothing come / or be heard / but the canonical scriptures ād liuely graces of Godes Spirit / according to the same. But these their apocrypha Leitourgies / can neither be said the word of God / neither the liuely graces of Gods spirit according to the same word / seing they were made and conceiued long before / and are wholy thus vsed / with∣out warrant / example or commandement in the word of God / yea are contrary to the rules of ād for praier / to the exercise and vse of Gods Spirit / and directly set against al the lawes of the first Table / by wors∣hipping God in vaine / afther their owne traditions / preceptes / ād de∣vises / and not according to his holy Wil / and commandement. And agayne / in his Refutation of Mr. Giffard / he briefly summeth vp in generall / some especiall reasons against the common prayer book afore said / besides the discusing of it in particular from point to point. His reasons concerning it in generall / he thus propoundeth / Refutat. pag. 49.50. 1. In that they presume to giue and enioyne their prescript wordes in praier, they take the office of the holie Ghost a waye, quēch the spirit of the ministrie, and of the whole Church, stop and keepe out the graces of God, thrust their owne idle devises vpon the whole Church, yea vpon God himselfe vvhether he wil or no: 2. In that by their Leitourgie they prescribe vvhat and how much to reade, at Morne to their Mattens, at Eauen &c. teachinge the church and ministrie to pray by nomber, slint, and proportiō, it is not onely po∣pish, but most friuolous and vaine, disgracing and not instructing the Church and ministerie: 3. In that by this their Leitourgie they prescribe vnto the Church what Scriptures publiquelie to read and vvhen to reade them, as these Chapters and Psalmes at their mattēs before noone, those at afternoone &c. On all the dayes that they have publique meetings and service through the yeere, and so from yeere to yeere. They therebie take from
the Church the olie and free vse both of the Scriptures and spirit off God. They therbie conceale and shut out of the Church a great part off Gods holie worde which they reade not. As also abuse without order those Scriptures they enioyne to be read: 4. In that they shread, rend, and dismember the scriptures from the holie Order and natural sense of their context, to make them Epistles, Gospels, Lessons, select Psalmes, to their festivals and idol worship abo∣ue-said, They most heinouslie pervert and abuse the Scriptures to the high dishonor of God & their owne feareful iudgment. 5. In that they bring in ād cōmaunde the Apocrypha writings to be publiquelie read in the Church: They both mainetaine and publiquelie teach the dangerous errors therin contayned, to the poysoning and sub∣verting of the faith of the church. They thrust these devises of mē into the place of Gods worde, causing the people therebie to reverence and esteeme thē as the holie Oracles of God, of like aucthoritie, dignitie, and truth, and to resorte vnto thē to builde their faith thervpō, and ther∣bie they bring in an other foundation into the Church: besides the high iniurie donne vnto God therbie: 6. Finallie in that by this their Leitourgie they bring in, erect, ād en∣ioyne a nevv & strāge kinde of administratiō, as is aboue proued in the perticulars: They make and erect a new Gospel, and so must needes also erect vnto yt a new ministrie. For the ministrie of Christ is ōly bounde vnto, ād vvil onlie administer by Christes Testament vvherein they haue a most perfect Leitourgie for the vvhole administration of his Church. Therfore this present Leitourgie and ministrie of Englād: are by al these reasons in general and particular founde ād proved at once to be counterfeite, vngodlie, and Antichristian. Hitherto Mr. Barrow / ād much more in his books afore named / as the reader there may fynd. Now to conclude / the end of publishing the∣se things / is to stirre vp al that feare God / seriously to mynd what true prayer is / and to be carefull to vse it aright / according to the word off God / which in al thinges / faith (without which it is imyossible to plea∣se God) must alway respect and build vpō. Rom. 10.17. and 14.23. Heb. 11.6. Iosh. 1.7.8. That so we may in this / as in all other dutyes of god∣lynes / learne to performe it so as whereby we may be cōforted of God / and God may be glorifyed off vs / in Iesus Christ. 1603. FINIS.
¶ TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. TOvvching the treatises follovving, know (Good Reader) that Mr. GREENVVOODS first vvriting concerning read prayer &c. vvas by the Prelates taken from him. Wherevpon he desired Mr. GIFFORD, vvho vvrote against him and had the copy of it, to publish it also to the vvorld. But he vvould not do it: and so by their meanes it yet remayneth suppressed. For vvhat cause, thou mayest vvell conjecture vvith thy selfe. These things, Mr. GREENVVOOD himself signifyeth here in the Treatise ensuing. Novv if by any meanes that first of his come into thy handes, be thou entreated, for the truths sake, eyther thy selfe to publish it, or to deliver it to such as vvill: That so the vvhole mat∣ter and cariage of it may better appeare to all men, for the urther manifestation of the truth in this behalf. In the meane tyme, these are published for thy benefit. The Lord give thee so to vse them. as may be for his prayse, and thy comfort in Christ: Remembring al∣vvay, that he is Mediator, not for any false vvorship vvhat∣soever, but for that onely vvhich is according to his vvord. Which poynt vvell mynded (as it ought) vvould soone end the question here contro∣verted, and all other the like: vvith all such as feare God▪ Mynd it there∣fore, and so farevvell in the Lord.
The preface 1. Cor. 2. 11. What man knoweth the things of a man if not the Spirit of man which is in himself: Euen so the things of GOD know∣eth no man if not the Spirit of GOD. 12. Now we haue receiued not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might knowe the thinges of GOD giuen vnto vs. 13. Which things we also speak, not in the words taught of mans wisdome, but in wordes taught of the Holy Ghost, we com∣pare spiritual thinges to spiritual thinges. My first writing being about that spiritual exercise of praier and true inuocacion of Gods reuerend name, where∣by the distressed soule of man, loaden with the burden of sinne, compassed also about with so many deceitfull enimies, contynual assaults of Sa∣tan, rebellion of the flesh, entisements of the world etc. seeketh daylie help of God the Father, giuer of all good giftes, hauing thorough. IESVS CHRIST free accesse by the direction of his holy spirit, for all occasions to vnburden yt self of whatsoeuer grief, or occasion of thankes yt is moued with: I ought still▪ and by Gods assistance shall keepe me in the meeknes of the spirit, not witstanding his vnchristian railinges, sclanders, and re∣proches against me and the truth. I then shewed that no other prayer could vtter and ease the seuerall occasions and distresses of this conscience▪ and that no other mans writing could speake for this soule vnto God, but the heart and mouth of him that prayeth for himself, or is chosen the mouth of many, vttering to God his or ther mindes for their present wantes or occasions of thanckes giuing, according to the will of God, as neede and occasion vrgeth, and the spirit giueth vtterance. And I furder proved that onlie this prayer pleaseth God, and is grounded of faith; to this effect I brought many reasons out of Gods worde, admiring the ig∣norance of this age, wherin (hauing had the gospell of Christ thus manie yeares in our owne language to search and try al things by) whole congre∣gations do make no other prayer to God then reading ouer certeine num∣bers of wordes vpon a booke from yeare to yeare, moneth to moneth, day to day &c. the same matter and words as they were stinted, euen out of that Portis, englished out of Antichrists masse-booke; besides priuate rea∣ding of mens writings instead of praying. And seing this counterfeit shew of worship and pretended prayers was made common marchandize in euery assemblie by this Antichristian priesthood, and that al men euery where were compelled to bowe downe herevnto, and to offer by such coun∣terfeit sacrifices; I perceaved the first principle of Religion (which is to inuocate the name of the true God, through the meditation of Christ in spirit and truth, with heart and voyce, for our present wantes according to the wil of God) was never yet sincearly taught by these time-seruing
Priests: But as an agreeable service to the humors of earthlie minded men which haue not the spirit of God, this ware was thrust vpō al people, they well knowing, that such a ministerie and such a Church of wordlings could neuer haue stood, without such a Samaritan worshipp and E∣giptian calf; and like earthlie deuised to counterfeyt a Religion, al men in∣clyned to some. And long have I heard this pretended worship inveyed against by many (sometymes zealous) for the errours and confused or∣der therof: Yet could I not heare anie to sett downe or teach, which was the true prayer that only pleased God, manie contriving divers formes of wordes, as though they had knowen the heart of man, counselled them to reade them, day vnto day, yeare vnto yeare, at evening, morning, dinner, Svpper &c. by portion, measure, and stint, as an offering to God what state soever the soule were in; not teaching the difference betweene reading vpon a booke, and prayer vnto God, all this tyme. So that true and only prayer hath not beene taught al this tyme, and those that knewe how to pray aright neglect it, this reading being most easie as they thinke, and they atest therunto, compelled in the publique assemblies thus to mocke with God, after the manner of the papists mattins, true zeale no where founde, but in the persequted remnant. These my first writings, caryed abroade by such as desired true instruc∣tion, and willing to make others partakers of such benefites as God im∣parted vnto them, yt fell into Mr. GIFFORDS hand; Who (as yt see∣meth being a marchaunt of such ware▪ fynding the gayne of the priesthood to depend here vpon, or as he saith (the peace & vniformitie of the Church) made head vnto yt; and that not with purpose (as the fruite of his labour sheweth) to edifie others, but standing himself a minister to this Liturgie, having made shipwrack of that conscience he sometimes was thought to haue; with all bitternes of spirit, and carnal wisdome, having no more sa∣vour of grace in his writings, then there is taste in the white of an egge, fleeth vpō me with vncharitable raylings, sclanders &c And loadeth not only me, but al the faithfull that walke by the rule of Gods worde, with opprobrious titles, of Donatists, Brownists, Anabaptists, Heretiques, Schis∣matiques, seditious, foolish, frantick, &c. to bring not onely vs, but the truth of God into contempt with our Sovereigne Prynce, and all that feare God: for he ceaseth not with laying al reproches he can devise vpō our persons; as one of those Locusts, Reu. 9. whose similituds are like vnto hor∣ses prepared to battell, whose faces like men, but theyr teeth as the teeth of Lyons; But also perverteth, blaspheameth, and by al meanes de faceth the truth offered him. Wel seyng the natural man perceaveth not the things of the spirit of God▪ (I speake not here of the giftes of the spirit but of the grace of God which sanctifieth the same, many hauing Charismata that haue not Charin.) And seyng I am alreadie thus rent, Gods truth deli∣vered by me, troden vnder his feete, I will followe the councell of Salo∣mon who forewarneth me that he vvhich reproveth a skorner receaueth to himself shame, and he that rebuketh the vvicked himself a blot: And so tourne me from him, leauing him to the consideration of his owne words:
where hee saieth in his Epistle to the reader, He that seemeth most zealous in Religion and refrayneth not his tongue, hath but bitternes in his heart in stead of heauenly zeale. And though nothing els can be looked for at theyr handes that are Apostate from that light they have sometymes themselves published, (of which sorte the worlde was never more full) yet for the good of Gods chosen scattered abroade, and for the defence of Gods trueth I cannot holde my tongue: And for the more playnenes, I will answeare as to him, though I minde not to haue anie more to do with him, till God giue him repen∣tance. Wishing grace by the direction of Gods holy spirit to him that readeth, to weigh both sides vprightly, and to follow the truth to his owne saluation. IO. GRENWOOD.
GEORGE GIFFORD. To condemne and ouerthrow read prayer, ye bring as the ground or founda∣tion of all your matter, this Sentence, GOD is a Spirit and to be vvorshipped in Spirit. Iohn. 4. This Scripture in deede is cleare and strong to cut downe al Car∣nal worship, as disgreeing from the nature of GOD. And if any mayntaine that the very bodily action of reading is the worship of God, it may fitly be alleadged against them, &c. IOHN GREENWOODS ANSWER. Wisdome is Iustified of her Children. IT is agreed vpon and consented vnto on both sides, that seeing God is a spirit, and onely requireth such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and truth: all carnall worship is cut downe hereby, of what sort soeuer, as disagreeing from the nature of God: And that all fantastical deuises of men; namely, whatsoeuer is not warranted in his worde, is car∣nall worship, a wearisomnes vnto him, and lothsome in his sight: So that no man ought to intermedle, attempt, or practize anie thing in shew of worship whereof they haue not sure grounde of his worde: For euen our God is a consuming fire. Now to put away all your (bodily) distinctions and earthly cauils, I still affirme (as I haue proued) the stinting, imposing mens writings vp∣on publique assemblies, to haue them read ouer by number and stint, or any other way, as a worship of God in stead of true inuocation, is a meere deuise of man, and so carnall worship; as also all other reading of mens writinges publiquely or priuatly in this abuse, for praying to God. Yet say you to apply this Scripture Iohn. 4.22.23 in this manner against read pray∣er, is friuolous, where I appeale to all mens consciences, for the weight therof. It is friuolous, you say, except I can proue that a man cannot pray by the spirit of GOD with sighes and groanes vpon a booke, or when prayer is vttered after a prescript forme &c. At the first step you go about to alter the question. All our prayers ought to be vttered after a prescript forme, euen that perfect rule and forme our Sauiour gaue to his Disciples and al po∣steities: But this is nothing to the matter. For the other which is nothing but a begging of the question. I allea∣ged certayne reasons to this effecet. First that those sighes and groanes in reading instead of praying were not of fayth, seeing in praying the sighes and groanes that proceede of faith, minister matter to praye without a booke. Secondly that you did but barely affirme the question in calling it prayer by the spirit when one doth read, seing reading is not praying at al: for as I then alleadged, to inuocate the name of God in spirit, is by the worke of the spirit to bring fourth of our hearts praier to God, which is than in truth when yt agreeth to Gods word. But reading is another mat∣ter, namely a receauing of instruccion into the heart from the booke. Out
of the first Mr. GIFFORD maketh men beleeue he hath fetched two he∣resies; the one a perfection of faith, the other that faith cannot be ioyned vnto, or stand vvith anie outvvard helpes for the encrease therof. Litle mar∣ueile, he found so mnie heresies in our whole writinges, that could finde two or three in my first reason: but that you may remember your self bet∣ter (though you had two yeares to consider) I will bring the wordes before you againe, if peradventure you may have grace to call backe yourself. I said if the sighes and groanes (in that kinde of praying) were of faith, yt would, minister matter without a booke: this sentence I may confirme by manie testimonies of scripture, that no peruerted spirit can gainesay or resist: the scripture teacheth vs euery where, that in praying the spirit on∣lie helpeth our infirmities, no other helpes mentioned or can be collected in the present action of prayer through the Scripture. He hath sent into our hearts the spirit of his Sonne crying:Rom. 8.26. Gal. 4.6. 2. Cor. 4.13. ABBA Father. vve beleeue, therfore vve speake. Yet here is not anie shew of perfectiō of faith, but of the contra∣ry, praying for our wantes. But this may be gathered, that God onely accepteth the fruits of his owne spirit in prayer, and requireth no more of anie, but that euerie one according to the proportion of faith, pray vn∣to him, as occasion in them requireth. Nowe to conclude that because in praying we neede not a booke to speake for vs, when the heart it self and booke of our Conscience speaketh with God; that therefore fayth neuer nee∣deth instruction, but is perfect, were sclanderous, false, and senselesse. The cause then of these heresies proceed hereof, that your selfe Mr. GIFFORD would needes frame two syllogismes, and in the moodes of your malice, cō∣straine the proposition of the present action in praying, to a general sentence of all times and actions, though both our question here was of the verie action of praying, and in the conclusion of that very poynt within six lynes after this, you had these wordes; Euen in the time of their begging at Gods hands; so that these heresies must be Mr. Giffords and not myne, seeing they are found to be coyned of his idle brayne, and godles heart, only to defame the trueth. But (say you) the most part are ignorant, weake, short of memorie, &c. therefore need al helps to stir them vp to pray, &c. where, by your own con∣fession, reading is not praying, but a help to stir vp to pray. And euen here∣upon all our errours arise, that you cannot discerne the difference of spiri∣tuall gifts, with the distinct vse of them. We doubt not but before prayer, and all the dayes of our life we haue neede of helps of instruction to praye aright, and for the fitnes of the mind and bodie, often fasting, reading, me∣ditating, etc. are great helpes to go before to humble our selues in praying: but in the present action of prayer when the heart is talking with God, the eyes, hands, etc. with attention lift vp to heauē, al the powers of our soules and bodies conuersant with God, to take a booke and read cannot be cal∣led in this action a help, but a confounding of the mind, of Gods ordinan∣ces, and a doing we know not what, though before and after, it be an excel∣lent meanes ordeyned of God, to instruct vs to pray and al other dueties. As for the confirmation you talke of, where I alleadged that a troubled
minde is the penne of a readie writer / therfore needeth not a booke to spea¦ke for yt in the action of praying: By troubled minde i vnderstood such a minde / as is presētly moued with the sight of some sinne / or vrged by other occasion:Psalm 5 17. a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart: ād not such a minde as in dispayre or doubt ys perplexed: and that the heart which is moued in faith with present occasion to call vpon God is the penne of a readie writer / (that is) hath matter ād wordes enough without a booc to vtter yt owne wantes / we may reade throughout the Psalmes. My throte is dry (saith Da∣vid) I am vvearie with crying &c. But here againe instead of answere / you tell me / I runne vppon the rocke of an hereticall opiniō of perfection: Wherin i wonder (but that i perceaue your right eye is blinded) you should be so ca∣relesse what you say / nay what after two yeares studie you put in prynt. Doth it follow / that because the heart / moued with occasion through the worke of faith hath wordes and matter enough in praying without a boo∣ke to speake for yt / that therfore faith is perfect? let equal Iudges cōsider. Here you say manie are so troubled & perplexed in minde, that they cannot pray till they haue some consolation by the direction of others; which whē they cannot haue, reading vpon a booke is a notable help, I allowe al this and agree / if you would make reading one thing / and prayer an other / divers exercises of the spirit etc. But in the verie action of praying to haue an o∣ther speake vnto vs never so good wordes of exhortation / were but a con∣founding of the minde and actiō / and an abuse of both those holie exercises. Euen so / by your owne comparison / reading vpon a booke in the action of praying / seing we cannot do both at once. Yt is the Spirit of God in the verie action of prayer that helpeth our infirmities. David in praying fin∣ding his soule heauie / stirreth vp himself thus. My soule whie art thou cast downe,Psalm 4 ende 43 whie art thou disquieted within me, waite on God; For I will yet giue him thākes, my presēt help and my God. He had a troubled minde / his mouth wanted no wordes to prouoke the Lorde to heare his complaint / and his heart to waite vpon the Lorde / and so through all the Psalmes you shall finde the conversing of the soule with God to be such / as yt were a moc∣kery to think reading vpon a booke could haue anie place in that ac∣tion / or that anie mans writing could lay out the present estate of the soule with the passions therof. The Priest may say / my booke whie art thou so euill prynted, for whē they reade the heart cānot reasō and talke with God. To the second poynt / which was but your bare assuming of the questi∣on / to say a man may pray by the spirit vpon a booke &c. I alleadged that to worship God in spirit / is / when the inward faith of the heart bringeth fourth true invocation / etc. this you graunt to be most true / and that none other is accepted of GOD / then that which procee∣deth from the inward faith of our owne heart: But you think that reading vpon a booke is to bring fourth of the heart true inuocatiō. This cannot be if we consider the difference betweene proseuche and anagnosis prayer and reading / the one being a powring fourth of vowes / petitions / supplications / the other a receaving into the soule of such things as we reade. This therfore i leaue to all mens consciences to be considered / whe∣ther
the matter we reade can be said a powring fourt of the heart / the whole vse of those divers actions through the whole Bible shew yt can∣not. Now where I said that you teach men insteade of powring fourth their hearts / to help them selves with matter and wordes out of a booke / you say I speake fondlie and foolishlie / etc. Mine answeare now is / yt is well I lyed not / if I had said you compell men to reade vpon a booke in all your publique assemblies / certaine wordes of your owne writings by number and stint / from yeare to yeare / and day to day the same / instead of powring out their hearts before the Lorde for their present wāts. I had not lyed. Now let all men by that which hath bene said consider the gross∣nes of yt / and so the follie remayneth to your self. But to help this matter / and to deliuer your self conningly in such strayte / you sa you wish all men to vse the help of the booke▪ that they migt the better powre fourth their hearts vnto God / being such as are not throughly able. First you graunt here / the prayers read vpon the booke is not the powring fourth of the heart / but ought to be vsed only as an help wherbie you graunt the who∣le question / and furder all your assemblies haue had no other invocation of Gods name this many yeares / but a help to teach thē to powre fourth their hearts. But whether mens writings may be read in the publique assemblies to this vse / we shall after make manifest / Here yt is graunted but an help / and not the powring fourth of the heart. And to whom is yt an help? to such as are notable to pray. Here eyther you must confesse your whole ministerie is vnable to pray / or that they transgresse in this high worship of GOD: for in an other place you graunt in all your as∣semblies this reading is vsed of mens writings for prayer / thus you may behold your best worship to be nothingh but a help to teach you to pray. Where I said that you teach men to fetch the cause of their sorrowing from the booke / euen in their tyme of begging at GODS hand / you say I speake fondly to call that the cause / which is the manifestacion of the cause etc. You here forget your artes / Is ther no more caues then one? if yt be the instrumentall cause / it is sufficient to prove / that if your Mini∣nisters had not their booke / they had nothing to aske / or els asking that which is in the booke / they aske not that wich before was in their owne heartes / so not comming heauie loaden / they goe emptie away / and leave the matter in the booke as they founde yt / till the next day / and then sing the same songe. But true prayer is / when the heart is first prepared / and moued with the sight of their wants as the child that asketh breade: So we should not pray of custome / but aske the verie thing wherof our heart feeleth the wantet. Your comparison againe betwixt the being stirred vp by a Sermon / and stirred vp by reading sheweth / that your self will not make the reading the powring fourth of the heart. Ther is no question but the exercise of reading is chieflie for instructiō and encrease of knowledge / and meditating is not the same / nether can be said to be al the vse of reading / though we denie reading to be praying: but because we are forbidden contētion about wordes / and I have offred you
as much wrong in saying you denyed reading to be for meditation at all / I will proceede to the more necessarie doctrines. Also for the controversie of Canonicall and Apocryphall / we shall speak in due place. Thus (say you) you have answered nothing at all vnto this Commandement giuen by our saviour Christ to vse that prescript forme of prayer, say, Our Fa∣ther &c. but by shift & cauill &c. Here you thinke you haue put me to a plunge / your self needed nothing doubt / but that I allowed the Cōmaun∣dement holie and good / and to extend to al Christians / as well as to the A∣postles / namely / to vse that prescript forme of prayer as the perfect pat∣terne and direction to all mens true prayers. But you I trust will make difference betwixt a forme to all prayers / and praying / or prayer. And he∣re you vehemently vrge me to answeare you / before I see you conclude any thing frō the place / and so I should runne into follie / to answeare a mat∣ter before I heare yt. In your first entrance of this discourse / you were rounde in your Syllogismes, by two at once to wrast my wordes / and can find none for yourself / Yt seemes your conscience is witnes the matter would not hang togeather. And me thinkes you had never more neede to haue shewed what you would drawe from this place Luke 11. seing I ei∣ther mistooke you last time / or els you make a simple collectiō: which was this: Christ said to his Disciples, when you pray say Our Father. &c. and not when you meditate say Our Father. Now what would you conclude of this / except as I said that Christ would not haue them meditate that Scrip∣ture: But this I perceaue was not your meaninge: now I partlie thinke your Argument should be (if the sworde were not brokē in the sheath) thus▪ Christ commaunded his Disciples when they prayde to say Our Father, &c. therfore to be tyed to reade ouer or say by roate certeine wordes, is law full pra∣ying. For the first / that our Sauiour Christ tyed no man or commaunded none to say ouer those verie wordes when they prayde / but to pray accor∣ding to that forme / after that maner as Matth. 6. I manifested in my first writing 1. that our Sauiour did not commaunde vs to vse those wordes. 2 that Matth. 6. doth not keepe the same wordes / nor that number of wor∣des which Luke 11. doth 3. that he did not say / read these wordes when you pray / or say these wordes by roate. After all which reasōs slilye passed away in both your answeres / you come with your bare affirmation / that he commaunded those wordes to be said ouer by roate or reading: yea a litle after you say / it is false to say that he commaunded not the verie wor∣des to be said ouer when we pray. And you furder conclude / that because Christ commaunded his Disciples to say ouer those wordes / therfore all mens writings in the forme of praier may be brought into the publique as∣semblies to be read for praier / being agreable to the worde. To which I āswere that seing no mās writings are without error / yt is pernitious and blasphemous doctrine you collect. First because you make mens writings of equal autority with the forme of praier which Christ hath prescribed 2 for that you gyue mē as much liberty and authority to frame and impose their Liturgies as Christ had to set downe a forme of praier / he being Lord of the house. The wickednesse of which collections you shall neuer be able to answeare.
And because you here vrge me therunto / I will make answeare to your two places of Scripture / wherwith by false interpretation you deceaue the simple / which taken from you / your matter is nothingh but cauilling: The places are these / Luce 11. Nom. 6. and because the one explanes the o∣ther / and your collections the same from both / I will beginne with nom∣bers 6.32.33.34. etc. Thus shall you bless the Children of Israell saying, the Lorde bless thee & keep thee, &c. Here you say they were commaunded to vse the verie wordes prescribed, in all their blessings. This I say is not true / for the Hebrew worde is Coh Tebaracu. thus shall you blesse: wher the wor∣de Coh is an aduerb of similitude / as we say / after this maner; which cannot be to say the same / but according to the same instructions. This worde Coh is ysed throughout the Bible in this maner / in all the Prophets whē they say / thus saith the Lorde: where the summe of their prophesies are onlie recorded to vs by the holy Ghost / ād not all the wordes. Againe this blessing is vsed in the Psalmes and Chronicles in prayer / for the people / in manie other wordes.1. Sam 1.17 Ely blessed Hanna in other wordes / etc. And where by Lce 11.2. yt is recorded / that our Sauiour Christ commaunded his Disciples / when you pray, say our Father, &c. yt is playne by the doctrines following. 4.5.6.8.11. verses / that Christ tyed no man to the verie wordes saying ouer / for he teacheth them to aske their particular wants / as a childe asketh breade or an egg of his Father: also to importune the Lor∣de for our particular wants. But to make this place more playne / the sa∣me holy Ghost in the 6. of Mathew 9. verse saith when you pray, say thus, Our Father, &c. where the greeke word houtos hath the same signification that the Hebrew worde Coh had which is / after this maner: and cannot be referred to the verie wordes saying ouer / wherupon Mr. Calvin vpon those wordes saith / Noluit filius dei prescribere quibus verbis vtendum sit: The Sonne of God would not prescribe what wordes we must vse. Now con∣sider how falslie Mr. Gifford hath interpreted these Scriptures / to say the Priests wer commaunded to vse the verie wordes / and that Christ commaunded to vse the verie wordes. As for his collections / that therfore mens writings may be imposed vpō publique assemblies by stint and number to be prayde, vt is intollerable error, and bringeth in all popery. Here I must call all men that reade this fruictlesse discourse to be wit∣nes of Mr. Giffords abuse of his tongue / to the defacing of Gods truth. In his Epistle he proclaymed / that I called all men Idolaters; which you shall perceaue to be his owne wordes / and to that end I will breifly re∣peat yt. In my first writing I affirmed the reading imposed Liturgies by stint ād limitation instead of true invocation / as also all reading mēs wri∣tings for praying / to be idolatrye. In his answeare he said / he could not see by what collour yt could be called Idolatrie, or maintayned out of Gods worde so to be; but yt seemes the penners of these things take euery sinne a∣gainst the first table of the lawe, to be Idolatry: if they do so (saith he) and with all do hold that no Idolater shalbe saued, then doubtlesse all are lost, &c. To∣this ignorāt excursorie I answered / that all false and devised worship by mans inuention was Idolatrye / as the first and second commandemens
did testifie: And so admit all the breaches of the first table were not idola∣trye / yet reading of mens writinges instead of praying must needes be ido¦latry / seing yt is a transgression of the second Commandement. Furder (though I needed not have followed his emptye head / euen a cloude wit∣hout water) yet I proceeded to proue / that no idolater could be saved but by repentance for their knowne sinne / and craving pardon with David for their hidden sinnes and secreat faults.Psalm 119 Moreouer (said I) do you thinke anie man is free from all inward and outward idolatrye / seing we cannot keep one Commaundement / and in some things we sinne all. In which wordes i plainelie reproued his grossnes that concluded all men idolaters which committed any idolatrye / and that no idolater could be sauld / and distinguished betweene the sinne of ignorance / weaknes / and inperfection etc. in Gods children / and open professed obstinate idolatrie. Yet this god∣les man would lay to my chardg / that i should call all mē idolaters / whe∣ras i neuer vsed such a worde in all my writings / But only answered his folly in this running out from the question / they were his owne wordes that brought this vpon his owne heade / by concluding / that if euery sinne against the first table were idolatrie / and no idolater could be saued / then all are lost / let the grosnes then be his and not mine. And i leaue it to the consideration of all men / whether i may not say / that they which trāsgres∣se the first or second Commaundements / do commit Idolatrie / without absurdity. But saith he though yt be so / yet the Scripture calleth not the godly / murtherers / Idolaters / etc. for the reliques of sinne remayning. I answere that therfore your former absurd cauilling where you said / if we hold it Idolatrie etc. ys by your owne mouth fully answered. But to auoyde this foyle / he hath an other euasion. I thought (saith he) we had reasoned about such grosse idolatrie as a Church is to be condēned and forsaken / which is defiled therwith. Here againe you misreport me: I neuer reasoned to that end in this whole discourse / but only laboured to shew all men this error of reading mēs writinges instead of praying / that they might learne how to conuerse with God and their owne Conscience / in prayer. And what mendes wil you make for this sclandering and defa∣cing of the truth / to all the world? all that I desire is your repentance and amendement / which God graunt vnto you if you you be his. It followeth in your booke thus: But seeing you confess tha all men be Idolaters, that is touching the remanents of sinne, it must needs follow there is no Church free from spots, &c. This worde idolaters must still be yours and then i willinglie graunt / that no man liuing is free from idolatrie / concer∣ning the reliques of sinne: Also that no Church vpon earth can be without spot vpon earth: So that now / by your owne cōfessiō / I pleade not for per∣fection in this life / though the more we want / the more we ought to ende∣uour. With what face then could you publish me an Anabaptist in your Epistle / and out of one mouth giue contrarie sentence? Doth your ordina∣ry teach you to cast out such bitter waters of vntruthes? was yt possible I should hold al men Idolatres / and some men without committing of sinne after regeneration / especially to mainetaine both such heresies as you gy∣ve
out? Well consider your self / before the Lord call you to accompt for de∣facing his truth / and pleading for Baal. I grant / yea / I were not of God if I should speake otherwise / that the deare servāts of God fall into most lothsome sinnes after regeneration / that the riches of Gods mercy might appeare in their repentance / through the worke of his grace. Then you reason thus: if ther be allwaies spottes and imperfectnes in the true Church vpon earth / then al your Argumēts you bring against the Church of England / are of no force / except you will mainetaine a perfection. M∣ne answeare is / I will not meddle with your Church to proue yt a false Church in this treatise / but refer you to Mr. Barrowes refutation of Mr. Gifford▪ him that handleth that part of your booke. Yet I must tel you your argument is verie simple: For after the same maner you migt reason thus: If ther be no true Church without spottes vpon earth, then the Church of Rome is the true Church, for yt hath manie spottes, & you all Schis∣matiques: Againe you assume the matter you should proue. It wil be proued against you / that you haue not Ecclesiā a people called fourth of the world to the obedience of Christ: Then / that the spottes of your Church are Egiptian vlcers incurable running botches. But I purposed not to deale with your Church / only my mind is to shew the vnlawfullnes of this readingh and imposing mens writings vpon mens Consciences in stead of true praying. Of which sinne the Lord giue you and this who∣le land grace to repent / that so men may learne more feruently to cal vpon God. The first Argument against read prayer, &c. No Apocrypha must be brought into the publique assemblies: for the∣re onlie GODS vvorde & liuely voyce of his owne graces must be hearde in the publique assemblies. But mens vvritings & the rea∣ding them ouer for prayer are Apocrypha, therfore may not be brought into the publique assemblies. G. Gifford. First touching the Proposition, No Apocrypha is to be brought into the pu∣blique assemblies: What can be more false? Apocrypha is opposed a∣gainst Canonicall: If nothing may be brought into the publique as∣semblies but Canonicall Scripture, then the Sermons and prayers of Pastors are to be banished &c. I. Greenvvood. IN the answere of this / you will needes oppose against both Propositi∣tions / and yet have nothing to say / if not to royle the doctrines deliue∣red with your feete / least others should drinke therof. The part of a wise man had beene to lay his hand on his mouth. In the first Propo∣sition
you would oppose the worde Apocrypha against the liuely voyce of Gods graces when you see I said onlie / that no Apocrypha might be brought into the publique assemblies. And furder to explane my minde / least you should willingly finde such a cauill / I added this reason for there only Gods worde & the liuely voyces of his graces are to be heard: Where I acknowledged those liuelie voyces to be Gods ordinance / yet nether to be called Apocrypha nor Canonicall. How can you say then I would ha∣ue these / or that these are banished / if all Apocrypha writings be banished the publique assemblies? Yet as I told you / I take Apocrypha to be all writings / but the Canonicall Authentique Scriptures. But (say you) then I will exclude the Paraphrases vpon the Scriptures and the Psalmes in metre etc. Affirme you them to be Apocrypha as you do / and can do no other / and I will through Gods grace proue they ought not to be brougt into the publique assemblies. First / no mans writinghs are giuen to the Church by testimonie of Gods spirit / and we are onlie commaunded to heare what the spirith saith:Rev. 2 7.11 therfore though mens writings be permitted to be read priuatlie of them that will / and therupon called Apocrypha (that is hidden) they may not be brought into the publique assemblies. Secondly no mans writinhs are without errour and imperfections / therfore not to be brougt into the publique assēblies:1. Tim 3.15 The Church is the pillar of truth. Thirdlie the Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and the Apostles Christ Iesus being the cheif corner stone / and not vpon mēs writinges / Therfore mens writins may not be brougt into the publique assemblies.Other foundatiō can no man laye. &c. Ephes. 2.20. and 1. Cor. 3. Fourthlie if we might bring in anie mens writings into the publique assemblies / thē all mens writings which we iudge agreable to the Scriptures. But this is forbidden / Ecclesiastes 12.11.12. My proof of the first Proposition to this: If anie mens writings are to be brougt into the publique assemblies by Gods commaundement because they are agreable to the Scriptures / as you in an other place al∣leadge / then all that are thought agreable to the Scriptures ought of ne∣cessitie by the same commandement / and if ther be no commaundement / then none are to be make Authentique which God hath not made Authen∣tique / For that were to set man in the place of God.Gallat 3.15 ebr 2.3.4. and 9.14. Matt 5.18 2. Timot 3.15.16.17. rev 22.18.19▪ No mans writinges cary that maiestie / that the penne of the holy ghost. No mans writinges are Cecuromenai, Authentique, confirmed by signes and wonders from heauen / sealed by Christes blood / that not one worde or title shalbe vnful∣filled / The Scriptures are all sufficient. All men must walke by that one rule; To thinke ther were not rules ynoug prescribed by the Lord for his house were blasphemous and papisticall. Now for the explication / interpretatiō etc. and speach vnto God in prayer: God hath giuen giftes vnto men to pray and prophecye / and ordeyned his ministerye of Pastors / Teachers / whose liuely voice is appointed to be the mouth of God vnto the people / and of his people vnto himself / in the publique assemblies. And thse gra∣ces are not Apocryphall, for no prophecie of the Scripture is of priuate in¦terpretatiō idias epiluseos: to euery one to giuē the manifestatiō of te spirit to proffit withal.2. Pet. 1.20 1. Cori 12.7. Most excellēt mē serue but their tyme in the publique as∣sēblies. Now I may cōclude a I beganne.
That only Gods holy word & the liuely graces of his holy Spirit are to be heard & offred vp vnto him in the publique assemblies. Where then in way of answere to the Minor Proposition, you say you see not how our speach vnto God should be Apocrypha: It answeareth not me / who deny an other mans writing to be our speach in prayer vnto God But conuinceth your self by your owne mouth / thus: True prayer ys not Apocrypha, but all mens writings are Apocrypha; Therfore mēs writings is not true prayer. Here when you haue nothing to say for your self / you woulde make me belieue that I accōpt the Psalmes and the other formes of prayer in the Scripture to be Apocrypha when they be read / though a litle before you confessed / you had in your last writing donne me wrong therin. I do accōpt the reading of thē for praying / to be a grosse and super¦stitious abuse of thē / yet thē to be holie and canonical Scripture. And here you haue flatly ouerthrowē your self: saying the worde Apocrypha is vsed with vs for that which is not Gods vndoubted worde vnto vs: And in your last writing / which should have beene your answere / you said / God speaketh to vs only by the Canonicall Scriptures. Now seing you would make your liturgies ād deuised formes of prayer / helpes and instructiō / and yet cannot make them Canonical / or Gods vndoubted truth / they must not be brought into the publique assemblie / much lesse imposed by lawe v∣pon the Consciences of all men. And here remember all your Liturgies a∣re cast out of the doore: besides that / you have not made in both writinges one direct answere to this most firme Proposition: which I will still leaue vpon you / thus. Only the Canonicall Scriptures & liuely voice of Gods owne graces are to be brought into the publique assemblies for doctrine & prayer. But mēs writings are neyther Canonicall Scripture nor the liuely voice of Gods graces in such as he hath appointed to speake in the publique assemblies. Therfore no mans writings, may be brought into, nor imposed vpon the publique assemblies. Thus migt I make an ende with this vayne mā / considering the who∣le matter is proved against him / all that followe being but repetitions of these former cauills / but that I must cleare my self of his vnconscionable sclanders. The second Argument. We must do nothing in the worship of God without warrant of his wor∣de. ut read praiers haue no warrant in his worde. Therfore read pra∣yers are not to be vsed in the worship of God. G. Gifford. To this I answere at the first, that it is a greate audacitie to affirme that there is no vvarrant in the vvorde for read prayers. vvhen ther be sundry testimonies to vvarrant the same, vnless you vvill make diffe∣rence
betvveene that which a man readeth vpon a booke, and that which he hath learned out of the booke. Furder I said, I do not re∣member that euer I haue read that God commaunded in the Scrip∣tures the prayer shalbe read vpon a Booke, &c. I. Greenvvood. SEing you haue indeed not answered one reason or proof I alleadged in my last writing▪ but with much euill conscience (as the handling sheweth) perverred them / I will leaue them to be iudged of them that shall see my writing. And here / seing you would not prynt yt / I will answere your cheif obieo. First then you graunt / that if I put difference betweene reading vpō the booke / and that which he hath learned out of the booke / mine Argu∣ment to sounde: For by your owne confession / God hath not giuen anie Com∣mandement to read prayer, and so yt hath no warrāt. Whervpō I gayne thus much: First / tha they which impose read prayer vpon the Church / do that wherof they haue no warrant in the worde / and that in the high seruice of God. Then that they which reade vpon a booke for praying / do that wherof they haue no warrant in Gods woorde: whervpon all your Ministers must leaue reading their snted prayers vpon the booke / or els stand vnder Gods wrath▪ and all that so pray with them / which wilbe a fearefull reckoning if they repent not their sinne shewed them. And although our question he cheif∣lie concerning the reading of mens writings instead of praying / yet I am content the other abuse of the Scriptures be included also though I make not both in the same height of sinne / as shall appeare in my seuerall reasons. As an vnconstant man then / you in the latter ende of the answere to this Ar∣gument would cal backe agayne that / which you here haue granted: Na∣mely / that there is no Commandement to reade prayer vpon a booke for praiyng. Of the contrary thus you reason: The people of God did reade the Psalmes vpon a booke whe they did singe, therfore men may reade vpon a booke vvhen they pray. I deny your Argument: besides that all men may see your vnstablenes in denying and affirming with one breath / you now go about to make reading of prayer a Commandement: thus you prove yt. Singing (say you) is a part of prayer. Singing may be read vpon a Booke▪ therfore praier may be read vpon a booke. Admit that Singing were a part of prayer / yet doth it not followe that all prayer may be read vpon a booke. But you speake like an ignorant man to say that Singing is praier / seing they are twoo diuers actiōs and exercises of our faith the one neuer read for the other / nor said to be a part of the other through the Scriptures / but are playnely distinguished 1. Cor. 14.15. what is it then. I will pray with the spirit / bu y will pray with vn∣derstanding / I wil sing with the spirit etc. agayne / if you be sad / pray / and if you be merye sing Psalmes / proxon ai and psalo. I will pray / and I wil sing are diuers exercises of the faith / if a man should say reading a chapter of the scripture and prophecying were all one / were he not wide?Ian. 5.13. Euē so euery
part of Gods service is not prayer. I graunt we are euery where com∣maunded to singe Psalmes vnto God. And alleadged that place of the Apostle to the Ephes. 5.19. Speaking to your selves in Psalmes and Himnes and Spirituall songes / etc. ād that of the Colo. onlie to this end / that in Psalmes singing we do not alwaies speake vnto God / as in tho∣se Psalmes which are only instructions and prophesies / in the 1. and 2. Psalmes you have not one worde spoken vnto God. Againe / as all rea∣ding of the prayers in the Scriptures is not praying or speaking vnto God / so the reading or singing of Psalmes I tooke to haue beene a spea¦king to our selves a stirring vp of Gods graces in vs etc. But I do not now / nor did not then hold yt so / in al Psalmes singing. And where you say I purposely left out the latter part in both places / which was this sing vnto God with a grace in your heartes / the Lorde knowes I had no purpose to injurie the Scripture / nor maintayne an vntruth / But thought we might do those thinges with a grace to God in our heartes / which were not properly ād directly a conversing by thought ād worde with him alone / but one thing might haue kept you frō crying out / here¦sie / in that I added this / that I would not stād vpō that reason / but de∣sired to knowe yt furder. But how vniustly could you nūber this for an heresie maynteyned of vs al in your Epistle / that we should denie that Psalmes should be songe vnto God. The Lorde keepe me frō such er∣rour. And a wofull Phisition you are / if I had bene in such errour, For the 102. Psalme I never denied: but that yt was a most excellent Psalme penned by Daniell or some other PROPHET / ād gyuē to the whole Church to be sōge or read as other Psalmes / in the forme of praier: But you must prove that the Church did vse yt as you say / to rea¦de yt ouer for praying / or were cōmaūded so to do. This is proof inoug they did not / because yt is a Psalme. Now thoug the Church speake ma¦nie tymes in the singular number / yet it is expressed in some other verse that yt is so. But now admit that you could proue that the psalmes we∣re read insteade of or for invocatiō / which you shall neuer be able to do / it doth not followe that mēs writinges shoud be brought into the assem¦blies and read for praier. The 6. of Nōbers I haue answerd before: Frō the 92. Psalme you reason thus. If the psalmes & other formes of prayer in the Scrìpturés were read or said by rote the verie forme of wordes for pray∣ing; The reading instead of or for praying. Here you durst not set your as∣sumption, it was so false / which should be thus. But the Psalmes & other formes of prayer were read for praying &c. This I shewed you was verie vntrue / they were neuer cōmaunded so to be vsed / nor never so vsed. My proof was this / they are giuē by the holy Ghost for other vses / as sing∣ing / reading / etc. ād not comaunded anie where so to be vsed / so that you do but cauill / not hauing one proof for all your shameles assertiōs. Now where I demaunded what this made for your liturgies, ād reading mēs writinges for praying / except you would make your owne writinges of equall authoritie with the Scriptures: You āswere / That if I denie the cōsequence / it was lawfull to use the Psalmes / therfore mens writings /
thē I wil shut out all praiers / euē the prayer of the Pastor. See your car¦nall handling / shuffling / and cōfounding Gods ordinances: Doth yt fol∣lowe that because mēs writinges may not be brought into the publique assēblies / or there read for praying / therfore the prayers vttered by the liuely voice of the pastor should herebie be excluded? this your shift was answered in the first Argumēt / your cavils are stale / you are againe con∣vinced. Touching the other matter of cōning phrases ād formes of prai¦er by roate / to say ouer certeine number of wordes / yt is popish and a meere euasiō / and bewrayeth your ignorāce in praier. In this you haue granted me that he which prayeth not with a feeling of his presēt wāts of his soule / but saith ouer certeine number of wordes of custome or af∣fectatiō / he is an hipocrite / which is true / proved. Mat 6.7. Now by this examine your daylie / monethlie / annuall etc. saying ouer / nay reading ouer certeine wordes / euery tyme the same / as you are stinted. It is plai¦ne the sacrifice of fooles / Ecclesiastes. 4.17. The two pointes wherin you protest so willinglie to agree with me / were these. First whether on¦ly such prayers as were made without the booke / were accepted of Gods childrē. Secondly whether the same spirit teacheth vs to pray / that taught the holie men of God before tyme. You grant both these / but that you would seeme to alter the first question: wel then / Gods owne spirit that taught thē to pray without a booke / or stinting of wor∣des / teacheth vs so to pray nowe / and in the action of praying giueth the mouth to vtter what the heart desireth / moved with the same spirit. Still then after your long shifting to and fro / I trust you will stand to your first wordes / that you never read in the Scriptures anie cōmaun∣dement for reading of prayers. Secondlie / to say ouer certeine numbers of words or phrases of the Scripture of custome or affectatiō / without feeling of / or asking for our present wantes / is hipocresie. Therfore I will conclude as I beganne / myne Argument standing good / that / To do any thing in the worship of God werof we have no warrāt of Gods worde / is synne. But read prayers haue no warrant in Gods Word / Ergo. etc. The third Argument. We may not in the worship of God receaue anie tradition which brin∣geth our libertie into bondadge. Read praier vpon commandement brought into the publique assemblies, is a tradition that bringeth our libertie into bondage. Therfore read prayer &c. The Minor is thus proved / that God hath left it in all mens freedo∣me to pray as the present occasion requireth and the spirit giveth vtte∣rance / according to his will. Againe no man hath power to commaunde anie thing in the worship of God / which God hath not cōmaunded etc. Marke. 7.7.8.9. Mat. 15. Gal. 5, 1. etc.
G. Gifford. I say it is vngodlie and neere vnto blasphemie, to affirme, that pre∣script forme of prayer is a tradition bringing our libertie into bon∣dage &c. my reason was & is, that the Lord by Moses prescribed a forme of blessing &c. Nom 6. the Prophetes in the Psalmes have prescribed manie formes of prayer. Our Sauiour Christ prescri∣bed a forme of praier &c. I. Greenvvood. HEre is a greate storme / and yet nothing but wynde. If you were in Caihas his place you would either have rent your clothes for zeale / or els condemne me before you vnderstand what I say. Is yt simple dealing do you thinke to say / I hold it a bondage breaking our libertie, for the Lord by Moses,  Prophetes, our Sauiou Christ also, to set downe a forme of praier or to prescribe a forme of praier: Did you not see that the Minor Propositiō speaketh of the reading / for praing / and not of the forme of prayer? Agayne / of the commandement / wher by men are compelled to reade instead of praying? Did you not see that these wordes brought in to the publique assemblies, did specifye the matter to be mens writtings to be read in the assemblies as a worship / yea invocation of Gods name: which is a grosse mockery. Not that ther is any Commandement to reade ouer those formes of praier mentioned by you / for praying: and so the Cōmandement so to reade them for praying is an abuse of them / and a Commandement of men and not of God etc. But that much more odious yt is to bring in mens writtings into the publique assemblies / proved vnlawfull in the first argument / and then to commit Idolatrie with them by reading them instead of praying / and that to cōpell men by Commandement wher God had set no Commandement  vse them / was a bringing all men into bondage of popish traditions. So that your common recitall of these places of Scripture is abuse of them / and you do but palinodian canere. I thincke if you get St. IHONS gospell about your necke as the Papists / you wil thincke you haue religion ynough. The more fearful is your Apostacy / you proceede from euill to worse. G. Gifford. About the Commaunding a prescript forme of prayer to be vsed, our Church doth agree with all godly Churches, yea the reformed Churches haue and do practize the same. here therfore I wish the reader to obserue that you Brovvnists do not only condemne the Church of England, but all the reformed Churches whatsoeuer, and can be no other but Donatistes. I. Greenvvod.
I Trust your madnes will appeare to all men / the poyson of Aspes is vnder your tongue: he that cannot rule his tongue his Religion is in vayne. Shall I in your heae be pressed with multitude of Churches? thē heare what the Lorde saith / Thou shalt not followe a multitude to do euill.Exo. 23.2 we have the worde amongst vs / we shall by that worde be either iu∣stified or condemned. Then either proue your matter from te Schriptures. or els giue eare to the Scripture. If those Churches you speake of / bring mens writinges in to the publique assemblies / et in force them to be read for praying / I would see their warrāt / we belieue not because men say so or do so / but because God speaketh: And where he speaketh / al men must be∣silent. You may accuse ther Countries as you wil / I knowe not their estate / but your drudgery insteade of true worship / is lothsome / the Priest with his masse-booke / and begger with his clapdisch canuize ouer the Pater noster for their bellie / which is your com-mon worship / with other trinckets. We shall speake of a Liturgie in due place. Here you breath out your accustomed lyes / sclanders / and . First you terme vs Brownists and Donatists / wheras I neuer conuersed wit the men nor their writings: I detest Do∣natus his heresies. And if they had beene instruments to teach vs anie truth we were not therfore to be named with their name / we were baptized into Christs. Browne is a member of your Church your brother / and al Brow∣nists do frequent your assemblies. And here you wish the reader to consider / that I condemne all reformed Churches / do I condemne all Churched for reprouing a sinne by Gods wordes May not the true Church (if they were such) err▪ Did I affirme at anie tyme tha they were no true Church that vsed read prayers / remember your self / you knowe who is the Father of such vntruthes. But because your Con∣science bare you witnesse you had wrongfully chardged me / and for me / all true Christians: you bring yt in by necessary consequence thus, you affirme (say you) prescript formes of prayer brought into the publique assemblies to be the changing the worke of the Spirit into an idoll, a tradition breaking Christian libertie, a deade letter quēching the Spirit &c, and therfore most detestable. But all reformed Churches recieue and vse it &c.  therfore. You cā reason well to bring the thruth into contēpt / your mouth to open and ton∣gue wher as a sworde therunto. If the proposition be true / drawe what con∣sequence you wil / it is yours an not myne / if the doctrine be true yt is Gods worde that giueth sentence against the sinne. And if you haue  spare of grace / procure that we may decide the truth with other Churches. Doth it follow that because imposing of mens writinges to be read for praying is an ynous synne / therfore they that vse yt are no Church▪ If I should say so / I should iustlie be called an Anabaptist. And here you accuse me to pleade for such a freedome in the Church / that nothing be receaued which is imposed by commaundement. Abaddon is the Father of such Prophets. Doth yt follow that because we would haue he Church free from al traditions of men which haue no warrant in Gods worde / that therfore we would not receaue Gods ordinances by Commaun¦dement. That we ought to receaue nothing by Commaundement in the
worship of God / which God hath not commaunded / the secōd cōmaun¦dement with the Scriptures I haue rehearsed / are euident. Deut 5.32 33. Mat. 25.2.3. Gal. 4.9. Collos. 2.20. But seing your self graueled / consi∣dering all the world cannot lay a Commandement to bring thei owne inventions into the assemblies / wher God hath laide none / but forbid∣den yt: you ranne to your former places of Scripture to wrast them as before / where your collections are but vaine repetitions of that which hath beene cōvinced before. Moses / the Prophets etc. prescribed formes of prayers / therfore men now may thrust their writings into the publi∣que assemblies: Your Argument is denied: and yet here is no warrāt for the reading them ouer for prayer. G. Gifford. The Church hath povver to expounde those prayers mentioned in the Scriptures, and to apply them to their seuerall necessities &c. I. Greenvvood. If you meane by expounding / the breaking vp off them by doctrine / and by doctrine and prayer to aplye thē to the seueral vses of the church by liuely voyce / far be yt from me to thinke otherwise. But if you meane by expounding / to make homilies vpon them / or liturgies by writing to be thrust vpon the publique assemblies / you are wide / and now iustifie homilies instead of preaching / and written prayers instead of praying▪ shew your warrant: The CHCHES power is limited by the word. G. Gifford. When the prayers be framed and composed of nothing but the doctrine of the Scriptures, and after the rules of true prayer, nothing is broug in which God hath not commaunded. I. Greenvvood. THis might have come in before your raylings / but you sawe yt was too silly▪ where is that commaundement of God / that all mēs writinges in forme of prayer agreable to the Scriptures should b brought into the publique assemblies) your bare worde is not enough t put  to silence. And when you have gott them into the Church / yo must prove that GOD hath commaunded they should be read fo praier. Where I said our Sauiour Christ neuer vsed the wordes when h praied / of that forme of praier he gaue to his Disciples / nether cōmauded his Disciples to say ouer these wordes / nether do we reade tha euer his Apostles did use them / or enforced others to vse anie certein number of wordes / you say I speake vntrulie. For say you the Disciple desired him to teach them to pray / as Iohn taught his Disciples / an he commaunded them / when you pray / say Our Father / etc. Luke. 1
and S. Math. an Apostle hath deliuered the same to the whole Church. I answer I haue never heard that Ihon Baptist taught his Disciples to say ouer certeyne wordes / nether can yt be gathered by our Sauiour Christes answere: for he answeared not alwaies their verie demaunde according to their wordes / but thervpon tooke occasiō to instruct them as he sawe neede. And I haue proued by the 6. of Math. that our Saui∣our did not commaunde them to say ouer the very wordes when they prayd; for the word Houtos in Mathew signifieth after this maner: A∣gaine that Math. recordeth not the very number / or the very same wor¦des that Luke doth. And now I reason thus: if Christ had commaunded those very wordes to be said ouer in praying / then we must alwaies whē we pray / say ouer those wordes: for in Math. . he saith when you pray / pray thus / Our Father etc. The word when sheweth / that this com∣maundement is to be observed at all tymes: And then the Apostles sin∣ned in praying other wordes Acts. 4.24.25. Furder yt being the most summary forme of prayer / most ample / most perfect etc. if those wordes were commaunded to be said ouer / then we ought not to vse any others for he is accursed that bringeth not the best offring he hath. Malach. 1.14. By all these yt is euident that our Sauiour nor his Evangelists tyed no man to the very wordes saying ouer / but according to that for∣me and those instructions: and now leaue of your popish dreames. Yet you would make mē belieue I reasoned thus / that the Apostles did not / nether our Sauiour himself / nor anie that we reade of / vse these wor∣des in prayer / therfore they did not use yt. Nay I said they did not vse those verie wordes in their prayers / but vsed other wordes according to their particular wants / as our Sauiour in the 17. of Iohn is said to do: therfore he nether vsed nor cōmaunded others to say ouer those wor¦des. And so I may well conclude / that to impose certaine wordes to be read or said by rote for praying / vpō the church / espeaciallie mēs wri∣tings / is an intollerable pride / euen a setting of men in the place of God: Also to vse them or bowe downe vnto them in that order / is sinne / and breach of Gods lawe. The fourth Argument. Because true prayer must be of faith, vttered with heart & liuely voi: It is presumptious ignorance to bring a booke to speake for vs vnto God &c. The fift Argument. To worship the true God afther an other maner then he hath taught, is Idolatrie. But he Commaundeth vs to come vnto him, hea∣vie loaden vvith contrite heartes, to cry unto him for our vvan∣tes &c.
Therfore we may not stand reading a dead letter, instead of powring fourth our petitions. The Sjxt Argument. We must striue in praier with continuance &c. But we cannot striue in praier & be importunate with continuance, reading vpon a booke Therfore we must not reade when we should pray. G. Gifford. These 3. I ioyned togeather as hauing no weight, you say I answeare by plaine contradiction without Scripture &c. And afterwar∣des, is not my bare deniall as good as your bare affirmation: &c. I. Greenvvood. STay your selues and wonder / they are blind and make blind. Is ther anie doctrine more spirituall / anie more inculcated by the Holy Ghost / then this accesse vnto God in the mediation of  owne spirit / to make our mindes knowne vnto God / to offer vp the  owne spi∣rit in vs / and fetch encrease from him by this  true  with the heart and voie? This colioquie with the highe iestie of God is it a mrter of no weight to learne to discerne betweene  exercises of the spirit / and to exercise his graces aright according to ? Rightly is it aid / the wisedome of God is foolishnes to the naturall man. But Mr. GIFFORD wil say he graunteth the propositiōs true and weightie matters  is the Assumptions that be so friuolous / and as he saith a litle after / ridicu∣lous: wel / let them be weyed. 1. That reading instead of praying is not a powringh fourt of the heart by liuely voyce. 2. That it is a quenching of the spirit / to reade an other mans wordes vpon a booke / in the very action of powring fourth our heart as we pretend. 3. That yt is not an vnorde∣ning of a contrite heart by faith / but an ignorant action to reade for pray∣ing. 4. That we cannot sriue in prayer / continue in prayer / be importu∣nate etc, by reading vpon a ooe. These are the  he tincketh of so litle weight: the bare deniall and contradiction wherof he holdeth of such credit / that it must suffice for answeere / seing he sait he hath before proued the vse of reading. See here he calleth yt the vse of reading: he could not say that reading is praying / nethr that these twoo exercises of our Faith can be vsed both in one instant / as one action. I haue sheweed that proche and an∣gnosis / praying / and reading / are divers actiōs both of the minde and body let the reader consider what weight then this matter is of / to talk with the lyuing God.
But for the benefit of such as haue grace to sauour the things that are of God / I will a litle illustrate these Assumptions / at least some of them. 1. That yt is a quenching of the spirit to reade an other mans wordes vpon a booke when I should powre fourth mine owne heart / the word yt self must be considered / the Apostle commaundeth saying 1. Thessalonians 5.19. extinguish ye not the spirit. Now to suppresse and leaue vnvttered the passiōs of our owne heart by the worke of the spi∣rit / giuing vs cause of prayer / and instead therof to reade an other mās writing / I doubt not wilbe founde and judged of all that haue spiri∣tuall eyes to see / a quenching of that grace yea in that action / the rea∣ding hindreth vs from pleading our cause with God / according to the occasions we see in our owne hearts. And by not teaching men to drawe out the graces of God in thē / to offer vp the sweete incense of his ow∣ne spirit in prayer / but an other course deuised by fleshly pollicye / the people growe in such Atheisme / that they learne not all the dayes of their life to lay open their owne soule before the Lord in prayer. How much more then / by imposing stinted wordes to be read in the whole assemblies insteade of the liuely graces / making yt a sufficient ministe∣rie to reade ouer such beggarlie ware / do you abondon Gods spirituall giftes / and make an assemblie of Atheists in most places of this land / yea in the best assemblies you compell such ware to be read / when and where the liuely voyces of Gods present graces should only he drawē fourth as an holie odour vnto the Lorde. Yea I appeale to the consciē∣ces of all that feare God / if this haue not brought the land generally in∣to Atheisme / that not one amongst an hundred can call vpon God. 2. That it is an ignorance to presume to come into so neere a conver∣sing with God / and to do one action for an other / so offring the sacrifice of fooles / let yt be sufficient proof that reading is not praying. That yt is presumptuous / to bring such lame sacrifices when you know to do better / let yt be considered whether you would so vncircumspectly / and carelesly approche to the presence of the Prince or any noble personage. Then if he be our Lorde / where is his honour / his feare etc. when we will teach men and compell mē to do they knowe not what in his sight / and to offer such lame sacrifice. The Priestes themselues care not what offring they bring him / Malach. 1. Thirdly the reading praier can be at no hand a striuing in praier / for the worde agoniso which is read Rom. 15.30. signifieth to contēd in fer∣uency both in minde and worde / to preuaile with God as Iaakob wrest∣led with the Angell / and said / I will not let thee go except thou blesse me. Genes. 32.24.25.26. such srift you shall see through out the Psal∣mes in th prayers of David and the Prophets / alas / howe this should be performed eyther in feruencie or contynuance / let the wise consider. 4. For importunacy and contynuāce in prayer / wherof we haue many precepts / let the worde be looked vpon / which is proscartreo to insist by perseverance etc. as we see our Souiour Christ make plaine vnto vs by a parable Luke 11.5▪6.7.8. nd Luke 18.1.2.3.5.7. now shall not
God auendge his elect which crye night and day? Experience we see in Moses / who when he lifted vp his handes to heauen the Israelites so long preuayled: Exod. 17. You can not make your read prayers serve in this vse with all your divises. For how would you effect this / except to make the Priest reade till he sweat againe / with vaine repetitiō / and the people that vse such stinted praiers to say thē oftē ouer / as the Papists their fifteene Aue marias and fiue Pater nosters as a cure of al their grie∣ves. By this litle I have spokē / yt may appeare (though the Lorde kno∣wes I am a mā of vncircumcised lippes / neither able to vtter that God giveth me by faith to see in these high thinges / neither yet cōprehending anie title of the excellcy of the) yet I hope yt shal appeare to Gods chil∣dren / how odious your marchandize is in Gods eyes / and howe you ma¦ke the ordināces of God of true praier / of none effect / by your traditiōs he only approuing the liuely graces of his owne ministerie / and such as haue giftes and are caled thervnto / to be his mouth vnto the people ād the peoples mouth vnto him in the publique assēblies: you inuent a ne∣we worship and extinguish his / which maketh mē fall into dissolutenes and bloudie tyrannie against his Sainctes. And where I alleadged that Paul would pray with the spirit and vn∣derstanding / and therfore not vp on a booke / you answere that Paul had no such neede of a booke as other men haue. But if you had looked vpō the text better / you should see / that the Apostle in his owne person tea∣cheth what ought to be donne in all Churches and of all men / And that he there taketh away the abuse of spirituall giftes 1 Corin. 14.15. and in the same Chapter sheweth that this and all other his doctrines are cō∣maundements of God. vers. 37. nowe either God prescribeth two wa∣yes to pray / or els your reading for praying is a devise of mā. But your self have confessed there is no commaundement to reade praier for pra¦ying. Yet here you cauill with your stale shift / that Paul taught others to singe Psalmes vpon a booke / which is a meere euasion / seing singing is not praying. The same Apostle saith to all that are borne of God / becau¦se we are sonnes God hath sent fourth into our heartes the spirit of his sonne which cryeth Abba Father. So that althoug we haue not like measure of grace / yet if we cannot pray we haue not the spirit of God / Gal. 4.6 I alleadged as you say a reason here why praier read cannot be true praier. In readig we fetch the matter from the booke which moueth the heart / In true prayer we fetch the matter frō the heart which cau∣seth the mouth to speake. Your answere is / that this is a most ridicu∣lous vanitie / for tell me (say you) this / when we bring fourth in true pra¦ier matter from the heart which causeth the mouth to speake / hath not the heart bene first moued with the worde of faith / etc? Let men here witnesse with me / what cause I had to esteeme you as a shorner / Againe / how emptie you are of anie spiritual sauour. And he∣re you haue no answere to giue / but aske me certaine questions: First whether when we bring fourth in true prayer / etc. the heart hath not beene first instructed. To this I answere / that againe you confesse the
reading prayer vpon a booke is not praying / but an instruction of the heart to praye. If you would stand to this / we should not neede haue so much labour / and all the places of Scripture which you haue alleadged for to proue reading praying / haue beene meerly wrested by you to de∣ceaue the simple. Wel (say you) but if the heart be first instructed before yt can vtter matter in prayer / whie may not the heart againe be moued with hearing or reading the worde / and so vtter prayer. Yes I graunt / and still you graunt me / that reading is not praying but moueth to pra¦yer: Then all your assemblies that haue no prayer but reading praiers / haue no prayer at all / ād all that vse read praier for praying do not pra∣ye but mocke with God. See if your Ordinarie will here be pleased with you: Yet you would denie all this with the same breath by a shifte / saying: The heart is moued whē one heareth the prayer of the minister and presently sendeth fourth prayers togeather with him. I trust you will not say that the heart of the hearer prayeth one thing / and the Mi∣nister an other / againe the prayer of the minister is the prayer of the people / by Gods ordinance / whiles they thinck one thinge / and are mett to one end / for auoyding confusion one speaketh / yet al pray togeather one thing. But the minister may as well preach and pray / or reade anie chapter and praye / as reade praiers / and praye both in one action of the minde / and voyce / which were strange. Your cauill then / whether the heart may be moved / and pray / both at once / is taken awaye / seing you graunt reading and praying / two seuerall excercises of the heart and voyce / which cannot be performed at once with liuely voyce. The con∣clusion is then / that either ye must fetch the matter out of your booke whē you reade prayer / and so do not pray for the particular wāts wher with the heart is moued and pressed before you come / or els you pray not with liuely voyce at al / when you read. The Lorde then hauing taught vs to breake vp our owne hearts / and powre fourth our owne petitions with heart and voyce / gyve grace to all his people so to wor∣ship him. We must pray as necessitie requireth.7. Argu. But stinted prayers cannot be as necessity requireth. therfore stinted prayer is vnlawfull. To this I answered, approuing the Proposition. And in the Assumption I did distinguish of matters to be prayed for:G. Gif∣ford. as that there be thinges necessarie to be praied for at all tymes. and of all men: of these a pre∣script forme may be vsed at all meetings of the Church. there be matters not at all tymes needfull to be praied for, for such there can be no prescript forme to be vsed contynually. &c. I Haue proved in the first Argument / that no mens writings areI. Green¦wood. to be brought into the publique assemblies / for there the liuely
graces of Gods owne spirit and Cononicall Scriptures only must be heard: In the Seconde / the vnlawfullnes of reading for praying / In the third / the vnlawfullnes to impose any thing by cōmaundemēt / that God hath not cōmaunded. And here we shall handle in few wordes the end of your stinted prayers. Your distinction is far differing from the wisedome of the spirit / for though many thinges be at all tymes needful to the publique assemblies / yet stand not the assemblies either al at any tyme / or anie at all tymes in the same neede and feeling of them / or fit∣nes to receaue them / so that except you can make all assemblies in the same want of such thinges as are alwaies needfull / or any at al tymes / in the same preparednes to aske / and vse thē that be needfull / you cā ma¦ke no stinted prayers for them. Giue are then to the Scripture in this pointe 1. Corinth. 2.11.Ia. 4.14 For what man knoweth the thinges of a man, if not the spirit of mā which is in himself, &c. Agayne, who knoweth what (shalbe) to morow? Whiles you then thought to haue founde out more then the only wise gouernour of his house sawe needfull for his worship in his Church / and of euerie soule / you haue lifted vp your self into his seate / and taken the office of his spirite vpon you / who searcheth the heartes and knoweth the reynes / and teacheth his people how and when to as∣ke / according to his will and eheir needs. Rom. 8.26.27. also the spirit helpeth our infirmities, for what we should pray as we ought we know not: But the spirit it self maketh request for vs with sighes & groanes which cā∣not be expressed: Yet searching the heartes knoweth the meaning of the spirit / because he maketh request for the saincts / according to the wil of God. And wher you say then / that if we marck the prescript forme of prayers of all Churches / we shall see this regard / that nothing be left out which is necessarie etc.Rom. 8.7 and 11.34 1. Cor 2.16 d 3.19 This bewrayeth your shallownes / the wise∣dome of the flesh is foolishnes with God: who hath searched the depth of Gods spirit / or knowne the minde of man? who cā prescribe the esta∣te of al Churches / and what euery moment is needfull to be praied for Odious then is such drosse of a fleshly mans heart. Your secōd provision / that nothing be prayed for in your liturgy that falleth seldom out / but they are limited to the time. Your Church hath not this provision / you compel men to pray against thunder and light∣ning at midd winter / and in your most solemne feastes against sodeine death: But the truth is / till you amend your wayes / God will accept no sacrifice of you / much lesse requireth this at your handes / to do more in his worship then he hath commaunded. And where you say / in the Church of England the preachers are not limyted touching the matter of their praiers / it is not true / you are all sworne to your portuis, howsoeuer / you may omitt some of yt for your Sermons / and vnder pretext therof / what part you will. And why is ther not a forme for prayer prescribed / to be vsed after and before your Sermons? ys it because the text is not allwaies the same / or that the speaker is not in like fitnes / or the auditorie in the same preparednes? I assure you these thinges might be sufficyent cause why you cannot use
alwaies the same wordes / and pray according to your necessities / and even so standeth the case for al other affaires in the Church. The dispo∣sition of the soule and the distresses therof / continue not in one state one howre. But let me tell you whie you haue no forme of praier for your preachings: In manie of your parishes / or (as you would have them) Churches / Sermons are of those rare thinges / wherof you saye ther cā be no proscript forme of prayer / yea your liturgie approueth a ministe∣rie and sufficyent administration without anie doctrine / which sheweth yt came out of the diuells forge / and not out of Christes Testament. But seing you would take vpon you to set so manie perscript formes of prayer / as ther is thinges necessarie for euerie assemblie to pray for / wher Christ hath set none / And if yt were a thing so necessarie to have prescript wordes at the administration of the Sacraments / I asked you whether our sauiour Christ had not forgott himself as you thought that when he commaunded his ministers to go preach and baptise / and shewed them the words of institution / and the Elementes to be vsed with all things thervnto needfull / he did not prescribe some forme of wordes for prayer in particular: In the tabernacle euerie pinne was prescribed / so that ether such formes of praier are not necessarie / or Chri¦stes Testament hath some wants. To this you answere / that yt is not of necessitie ther should be a sett forme of prayer prescibed for the admi¦nistration of the Sacraments: The minister may conceive prayer / etc. Hold you to this / that it is not of necessity: you will denie it againe the next Argument. Well here you graunt / yt is not of necessitie / But you haue not answered me / till you tell me whether you hold it necessarie or no: if yl be at all times necessarie / the Testament is not perfect. Againe do you not hold yt of necessitie / when you eycommunicate men / and de∣pose your ministery for not observing yt? But you saye / yt is for conue∣niencye. If it be a part of Gods worship / and all tymes conveniēt / then is it necessarie / and if yt be not necessarie / put such conueniency in your cornerd Capp / or surplus. Nowe if yt be necessarie at all times / you must proue yt is commaunded in Gods worde / or els say that all thinges ne∣cessarie in Gods worship be not cōteyned in Gods worde / which were-blasphemous and papisticall to affirme. To this you graunt all things necessarie and convenient are conteyned / and aske if I be ignorant that ther be manie thinges conteyned in the scriptures / that are not expres∣sed in particulars / but be gathered from the generall rules. No / I am not ignorāt of this: but if it may be gathered ether by expresse wordes / or by general rule / that ther should be prescript formes of praier for the administration of the Sacraments / or anie other particular action of the Church / then must yt be so of necessitie / because God hath commaun¦ded yt / though not in particular / yet in generall rules: But you graunt yt is not of necessity: therfore yt is not commaunded in particular / nor conteyned in anie generall rule. Yet you demaunde of me / if one should obiect that ther were not cō∣maundement in the Scriptures / nor example for anie praiers to be
made at all before preaching etc. I would say he should lye against God / we have both. For the Apostle sheweth yt was the chief part of their office / to perdure in the worde ād prayer. Act. 6.4 / 1. Cor. 14. and 1. Tim. 2.1 / Acts. 2.42. besides / all things are sāctified vnto vs by the word and praier. And because they never vsed doctrine in Church / but prayer wēt before / their meetings is said to be vnto prayer.1. Tim. 4.5 Act. 16.13 6. Some things ther are I graunt that are not prescribed in particular / and yet are commaun∣ded by general doctrine / as baptisme of Infants. But whatsoeuer is commaunded ether in particular or necessarie collections from general rules / are of necessitie to be obeyed / as the commaundements of God / and may not be altered / but your particular formes of prescript wor∣des have no such warrant. Nowe seing you would have no prescript wordes of prayer for the minister to vse before his preaching / nor of necessitie for the Sacraments / and haue none for excommunicatiō / etc. I wondred wherof your Portuis is made / and wherto yt should serue / except for churchings and burialls and such popery / wherby you leaue the commaundements of God / to sett vp your owne traditiōs. And here vpon I demaunded wherupon you would make your stinted and sett prayers. You marueile I should be so babling and make such questions you meane about your babling worship. You saye of the particulars of the Lordes prayer. I demaunde nowe againe / whether you can num∣ber the starres of heauen / or the sandes of the sea / if not / much lesse the particulars of the Lordes prayer / There is medecine / and direction of prayer for euerie soule / and euerie disease therof to be drawen fourth by doctrine and prayer as the need requireth you would sett a liturgie vpō some thinges / and compell mē thervnto euerie meeting / which were no¦thing els but to seale vp the fountaine / and send men to the drye pitts of your execrable devises / from the whole fountaine / to a pitcher of wa∣ter / from the liuely graces of doctrine and prayer / to your owne writin∣ges. Paul commaunded to pray for Kings and Princes / yet bounde no man what wordes to vse.1. . . 1.2.3.4.5 The Lord gyve you repentance of such pre∣sumptuous sinne / as to alter his worship. If you cānot knowe the esta∣te of the soule before hand / you can make no formes of wordes for yt. ▪ Argu▪Read praiers were deuised by Antechrist, and maintaine supersition & an Idoll ministery: therfore read praiers & such stinted service are intollerable &c. G. Giford.Antichrist devised manie blasphemous wicked praiers. But to say that the reading or following a prescript forme of praier was his, is most false, for there were Liturgies in the Church of olde, before Anti∣christ was set in his throne &c.
THe Scripture never inforced to reade praiers for praying / nether stinted v what / or how manie wordes to vse / nether is the formes of praier prescribed in the Scripture / anie deuise of man.I. Green¦wood. Let vs then hold these two to be the matters in hand / the one / reading in steade of praying / the other / stinting and limiting by a written liturgie, what and howe anie wordes to pray / with all other such prescriptions as your liturgie conteyneth. All may be affirmed antichristian which is not war∣ranted by Christes worde: Yet your liturgie, is euē from that Antichrist lifted vp into the throne you speake of / as may of all men be seene that will cōpare yt with the Portuis: And (as I haue heard) the Pope would haue approued of your liturgie, if yt might haue bene receaued in his na¦me. Nowe we haue proued in the discourse before / that reading for pra∣ying hath no warrant from Gods Worde / which maketh them two se∣uerall and divers actions euery where. Here then we must consider something for an other liturgie, thē Chri∣stes Testament / which we shall find to be nothing els / then an other go∣spell. And because Mr. Gifford saith ther were liturgies in the Church before Antichrist was lifted vp into his throne (which I will not denye) I would have all men vnderstand that I do not go about to proue the Church no Church that hath a liturgie (as mine Arguments are falslie wrested to that purpose) but to proue the vnlawfullnes og such liturgies thrust vpon mēs Consciences / is onlie my determination through Gods assistance. The worde liturgia signifieth publicum munus, ergon Laou, the worck of / or for the people: that is the very execution of the mnisteriall actions in the Church / according to the worde / of all the officers therof that is the practise of those ministeriall duties prescribed by Christ / we may euery where reade. In the first of the Gospell of Luke the 23. ver∣se it is said. And it came to passe that when the daies of his ministration were past he went home to his house, meaning Zacharias: where we see the worde Leitourgia for his execution of his ministeriall functiō. Now this Leitourgia of the newe Testament / is euen the rule and function prescri∣bed by Christ / for the publique actions to be donne in his Church: which leiturgie of Christ is perfect / Gal 1.8.2 Heb. 22.18.19 2. tim 1.13 1 tim 6.14 and he pronounced accursed that addeth any thing therto / or taketh any there from: yea all mē are bound to keep the true patterne therof / without alteration or innouating anie part of the same: yt is called a commaundemēt to be kept without spott / till the appearing of our Lorde Iesus Christ. Nowe / to make an other lei∣turgie, is to lay an other foundation / and to make an other Gospell / not that ther is an other Gospell / but that ther are some willing to peruert the Gospell of Christ. Thē your leiturgies to which you are sworne / and by which you administer / being (as you cannot denie) an other leiturge thē Christes Testamēt / is plaine an other Gospell / for the Canōs and ru¦les you prescribe and impose are such as he hath not prescribed or com∣maanded / or at the best / a transforming of his ordinances / Now if you should say / you do nothing but make lawes of particular thinges collec∣ted frō the scriptures / ād with that collour impose your liturgies, we ha∣ue
shewed the vnlawfullnes of bringing anie mans writinges / as rules in∣to the Church. For the explaning of the whole will of Christ / so far as is meet for vs / he hath giuen vs his officers to administer / according to his liturgie by liuely voyce / and due executiō of all things by one rule. Making then a newe litourgia, you must also make a newe ministerie / for Christs ministerie cānot administer after a counterfeit liturgie. And that Antichrist was the theif Innouator of this liturgie (howsoeuer the thing might be long a working by litle and litle) yt is plaine when he is called Antikeimenos,2. Tes. 2.4 that opposite man / or laier of an other foundation Now we must not make all liturgies beside the Testament / of like wic∣kednes or blasphemie / But how neere the most heynousest yours ap∣proach / let him that answereth the other part of your booke witnesse vnto me. Nowe where I said you had confessed that you neuer read in the Scriptures any warrant to reade praiers vnto God / you say now / I knowe I haue falsified your wordes. Surely yt would be knowē / for I would not willinglie so do / your wordes you say were these / to your re∣membrance: God neuer commaunded a man to reade praier vpō the booke: Is not this the same that I saye: you confesse ther is no warrant for rea∣ding prayer, is ther anie thing warranted in his worship / that he hath not commaunded? Then you aske me if I will gather thus / is it not ex∣presse cōmaunded / therfore yt is not warrāted. No you forgot the wor∣de expressie / to help your self to saye and vnsaye. I gathered / that becau∣se you said absolutely it was not cōmaunded / therfore yt was not war∣ranted. Here you come againe to shewe your ignorance in the Scriptu∣res / to say ther is not anie expresse commaundement to vse praier befo∣re or after doctrine. And remember / you here will haue it a commaun∣dement / and said before you hold yt not of necessitie. G. Gif∣ford.There vvould sundry inconueniences grovve for vvant of a Liturgie, or prescript formes of publique prayers. I. Green¦wood.STill I must put you in minde of the wisedome of that gouernour of his house / the builder / beginner and finisher of our Faith Christ Ie∣sus: he foresawe what inconueniēce would haue growne if either mē or Angells should make newe liturgies, or other formes of praier / thē he hath prescribed / for the publique assemblies. Here therfore you deeply chardge him / not to haue donne all thinges that were needfull / in not prescribing you more formes then he hath donne / or not suffred learned diuines to impose their owne writinges vpon publique assemblies / as rules for the Church / and worship vnto God. But see what the Scrip∣ture saith / who hath knowē the mynde of the Lord, Cor 2.16  2.20 / that he might instruct him. Againe▪ wher is the wise, where the Scribe, where the disputer of this world, hath not God made the wisedome of this world foolishnes? To put you out of doubt then / that we neede not any newe liturgie / nor anie mens writinges to be brought into the publique assemblies / the Holie Ghost saith / 2. Timot. 3.16. The whole Scripture is Theopneustos, in∣spired
of God / and profitable vnto doctrine / vnto improof / vnto correc∣tion / vnto erudition which is in righteousnes / that the mā of God may be absolute / perfect fully furnished vnto euerie good worcke. Nowe if onlye the Scriptures be Theopnestos, and sufficiēt to make Gods chil∣dren absolutely perfect / even fully furnistied to euery good worck / what blasphemie is yt to say / sundrie inconueniences would growe / if mens writinges were not imposed vpon the publique assemblies? And in this your wisedome / let vs see what is the chiefest inconueniē∣cy that would growe. You say euerie frāticke spirit (of which sorte ther be manie in the ministerie) would not only be vnlike themselues / but va∣rie from others. I answered / and still do / that the Papists haue not so weake a reason for their Idolatrous liturgies / Rubricks, & Canons. You say yt appeareth by all my Arguments / how meete a man I am to iud∣ge the weight of reasons alleadged by the Papists / and others: well I am weake / and you strong / foolish / and you wise / yet might you haue shewed me a weaker reason which they alleadge for their constitutious ecclesiastical / as they call them. But my chief answere was (wherby you might haue beene satisfied) that if it were but in Phrases the ministerie should differ / yt is no sufficient cause to ordeine liturgies. And if they of∣fend in matter of doctrine or conversation / the censure of the Church should help that. The first you graunt / the second also you confesse / that the Church should censure such thinges: But you say ther are sundrie o∣ther differēces in administration of publique prayers and Sacramēts as in order and ceremonies which the Church is to haue regard of / and not to leaue arbitrarie. All other ceremonies in Gods worship then Christ and his Apostles haue prescribed vs / are diabolicall / and not A∣postolical. Then / for all thinges donne in the Church in those publique actions / the offenders must be admonished / if they transgresse the rules of the word. And for the orers you speake of / you meane circumstāces of time / place / kneeling / sitting / standing etc. of them thet can be no fur∣der lawes / then Christ hath prescribed / that all things be donne to edify¦ing / in comelyues and decency etc. of these to set particular lawes / were to breake the lawe of God / which leaueth them in the Churches liberty as neede requireth / to the glorie of God. In these thinges to do anie thing contrarie to the generall rules of order / edifying / decencye etc. the trāsgressour is by those rules to be instructed / admonished and cēsured. Well / here you haue made a faire hand / to make read prayers but a matter of order / which is all the worship you haue / to bring in mens writings into the publique assemblies / to make then ether rules to bind the conscience / and so put them in the place of Gods booke / or to reade them ouer for praying / is but a matter of order / well then put them in your cornerd Capp / we haue enough rules for the ordering of Christs spouse / without such Babilonish ware. Here you say mine experience is not so great as my boldnes. I passe not to be iudged of you / yt is not like that the enchaunters of egipt should knowe the beautye of Sion: ther is a cloude betweene you and vs: we haue (blessed be our God) a
pillar of fire before vs. An other fault you say in my former reason / is / that because the censure of the Church should redresse defaultes / therfo∣re ther needeth no liturgie. Naye take all with you: No fault cā be censu∣red that is not a transgression against the rules of Gods worde, and those to be censured by the doctrine and admonitions of the Church, thefore we nee∣de no leiturgies. To the worde of God only / ought all mē to be bounde by covenant / and for the transgressions therof only / to be censured. G. Gifford. The Church hath this power, to ordeine according to Gods worde, & to appointe such orders in matters of circumstance &c. as shall most fitly serue to edification. And then these orders being established the Church is to driue men to the obseruation of them. I. Greenvvood. FIrst / in this your papisticall mudde / I must tell you / your reading of mēs writinges for prayer / is a false worship of God / and not a mat∣ter of circumstance, And for matters of order and circumstance / which are no part of the worship / ther can be no other lawes made of thē / thē Christ hath made: As for ordeyning of lawes in the church / it is to plead for vnwritten verities / and to make the lawe of God vnsufficiēt: nether cā yt be according to the worde / to make anie lawe / that God hath not made / but an adding to his worde / which is execrable pride: these your wordes then (according to Gods worde) was but a cloake to couer the grosseues of your position: for the worde / ordeyne / or create lawes / is to make some / that are not made before: let vs thē see your cleane sentence to be this / The Church hath aucthority in matters of order & circumstance to make & ordeine lawes in his Church▪ for his worship: nowe see how you contradict these Scriptures. Rev. 22.18.19. Prov. 30.5.6. euerie worde of God is pure etc. put nothing to his worde least he reprooue thee ād thou be found a liar. likwise Deut. 4.2. and 12.32. and Gal. 3.15. though it be but a mans covenant / when it is confirmed / no man doth abrogate it / or superordeine anie thing to it. And the second Commaundemēt for∣biddeth anie such humane tradition in the worship of God: all the Po∣pes trinckets might be brought in by the same grounde: We would wil¦lingly haue seene your warrāt for this doctrine / your bare worde is not sufficient to impose other lawes then God hath made / vpō his Church. This is the foundation of poperie and Anabaptistrie / to giue libertie to make lawes in the worship of God. Yet you will go furder / that such lawes being ordeyned and established by publique auctoritye / the disci∣pline and censures of the CHVRCH are to driue men to the obser∣vation of the same. By your iudgment our Sauiour CHRIST was an Anabaptisticall Schismatique / that would not himself / nor his Disciples / obey and obserue the traditions of the Elders: And what saith he vnto pleaders for traditions. It is thus writtē Marke 7.5. thē asked him the Pharises and the Scribes, whie walke not thy disciples accor∣ding
to the tradition of the elders, but eate meate with vnwashed hands. Thē he answeared, surely ISAY hat prophecied well of you hypòcrites, as it is written▪ this people honoreth me with their lippes but their heartes are far frō me. But they worship me in vayne, teaching doctrines mēs precepts. Fo you lay the commaundement of God aside and obserue the tradition of mē. And to helpe fourth your euill matter / instead of proof from the scrip¦ture / you fall out into furious exclamation against them that desire on∣ly to haue the worde practized: saying / who is able to imagine the innu∣merable divisions and offences in the practize of your anabaptisticall freedome / in which you deny the Church to have power to ordeine and impose any orders? lett all men iudge the venemousenes of this tongue / Christ pronounceth them accursed that add or super ordeyne any thing to his worde / and you pronounce iudgment of them / that only obey his worde. Shall yt be said that Mr. Gifford holdeth / that the only practi∣ze of Gods worde / would be the cause of innumerable diuisions and of∣fences? This hath bene Satans old accusation in the mouth of the most enimies of Christs Gospell: nowe yt must be Mr. Giffords accusation of Gods ordinances / to be insufficient  vnperfect / etc. fearfull is his Apo¦stacy from that truth he hath knowen. I take it / yt is more like to be A∣nabaptistry / to practise any thing without warrant of the word / to ma∣ke their owne devises lawes / in Gods worship / then to do nothing but what God hath commaunded / within the limites of our callings. For the frāticke ministery / yt came of your owne wordes / that ther∣fore you must needes haue a liturgie, because ther are manie frātick spi∣rits in the ministerie? then I say / it is like you haue a frantick ministe∣rie / that cannot be gouerned without an other liturgie then Christs Te∣stament: For their great giftes you speake of: I will not compare with them. My reason from the Colossians was that as the church there is com∣maunded to admonish their Pastor Archippus / if he transgressed / and to stirr him vp to his busines / so all minister that caused divisions / con∣trary to the doctrine of Christ / were to be admonished / and auoyded / if then repent not: so that the worde of God / and admonition by the same / if they transgressed / is the waye to keepe all men in due order / and not imposing liturgies vpon the church / besides Christs Testament. And where you collected thus / that if read praiers / and imposed litur∣gies be Idolatrous / thē wher will you finde a visible church / say you. I answered that the true Church might erre / euen in this poynte / though not in like height of sinne. Then you desire / that the churches of Eng∣land may find lik fauour at our hand:M. Bar∣rowes re¦futation discove∣ry, etc. to which I answeare / let him that handleth that question with you / shew you / how your sinnes herein exceede other countries / and persequt such as reproue you. Your church (as you call yt) cannot pleade ignorance. Your ray∣ling speaches / of blind Schismatiques / Donatists etc. bewray what sweet water is in the heart: if you cannot proue your church to be the established church of CHRIST / they light all vpon your self.
Ther are none Schismatiques, but such as departe from the faith / shew wherin we haue transgressed / and will not be reformed. In the meane tyme you are Schismatiques from Christ / in that you practize the Sta∣tutes of omry. You chardge vs with pride / for that (you saye) we imagi∣ne to knowe more then all the Churches vppon earth. This also hath bene Satans old weapon to deface the truth Iere. 18.18. why maye not a simple babe in Christ see that / which whole nations haue not seene? we cannot but speake the things GODS Worde teacheth vs: if we speake trueth / you need not oppose that we iudge anie man / yt is the worde of God shall iudge vs all / ād I saye / yt is an old popish Argument to reason thus (all Churches do such a thing / therfore it is lawfull) except you hold with the Pope / that the Church cannot erre / which were blasphemous. You are not well pleased that I will not say it is no Church that hath a liturgie imposed vpon yt / and because you haue so often sclandered me / that I hold yt so / you take great paynes to conclude it. I haue said that to impose mēs writings / to be read in stead of praying / is to worship God after a false maner / that yt is a devise of Antichrist / a deade letter / quenching the spirit / not of faith / Idolatrous is changing the worke of the spirit into an Idoll / breauing our Christiā libertye / and so most detestable. By these speaches I condemne al chur∣ches say you: this is not true / I condemne but the sinne. But you have sayd I deny that to be the Church / that hath any thing ymposed, I say you speake an open vntrueth / and remember the iudgment of him that inuenteth and maketh lyes: And God giue you grace to repent / if you belong to him. The consideration of this our discourse / I hartelie com∣mēde to be dulie ād vprightly wayed / of all that feare God / who graunt vs his grace to forsake any sinne / where it shalbe shewed vs / by how weake instruments soever yt be reproved / and pardon me all my de∣faults / in this my hastie answere. Thus have we seene the vnlawfull∣nes of thrusting mens writings vpon publique assemblies / and reading instead of praying. A generall Argument against their vvorship, in respect of their present estate, both of Ministers and people. The praiers of such ministers & people, as stand vnder a false gouern∣mēt are not acceptable, not only because they aske amisse, but because they keepe not his Commaundements: The praiers of such ministers & people as be subiect to Antichrist are abhominable: Those ministers & people vvhich stand subiect to the Bishops and their Courts, are subiect to Antichrist &c. Therfore their praiers &c.
G. Gifford. These do oncerne the third & fourth accusatiō, and therfore the answere is included in the ansvvere to them, Yet I take exception against the first, that the Church may be holden by force from executing Gods commaundemens touching externall gouernement, and yet be the true Church of Grd, I alleadged the Church that was holden captiue in Babylon &c. I. Greenvvood. HEre / after your acustomed maner / you offer me great wronge: first / insteade of answere / you alter the question very subtylie: then you dismember my former answere / and not only so / but you haue nether let my former āswere be āswered / nor prynted. Thus you alter the questiō / and answere not / where the Propositiō speaketh of a ministerie ād peo∣ple standing vnder a false gouernmēt / you say the Church may be holdē vp force / from executing Gods commaundements in externall gouern∣ment / wherof I never doubted: what is this then / but to deceaue your Reader / both to iudge sinisterlie of me / and be drawen from the truth himself? But indeede you meane not this (holden by force) of ciuile bon∣dadge or persequution / for then ther were no difference betweene vs / ād myne Argument should stand vntouched. You affirme then that the Church may stand vnder a false gouernement / inforced therunto by the tyranny of the ennemie / and yet in that estate be the true apparant Church / by open profession / which is nothing / els / then that the Church may professe Christianisme and Antichristianisme / both at a tyme / sub∣iect in minde to Christ / and subiect to Antichrist in outwarde obediēce. That you hold this doctrine in this place / the processe of your matter proueth / and to make all plaine / your wordes in the last writing (which here you summe vp) were these. But if the Church at any tyme be by may∣ne force restrayned from some priuiledges, or haue some gouernement set ouer it, which agreeth not with GODS worde, which it cannot auoide &c. See nowe how smoothly this man hath put away the crosse of Christ / by teaching men to stand vnder a gouernement / contra∣rye to Christes. I thought the ordinances of the newe Testament had beene a kingdome that could not be shaken. Heb.: 2.28. that none could haue beene a mēber of Christ / Rev. 14.9 10.11.1 that receaueth the marcke of the Beast / though yt be but in his hand / or could be holden a member of Christ / by outward profession / that here had beene the patience of the Saincts / to suffer vnto death / rather then to bowe downe / either in minde or bodie to an other gouernment / then Christs. How is he a Lorde to them that are not gouerned by him? Well I needed not haue stand vpon this doc∣trine / but that he nether prynted my former answere / nor answered in
these pointes / and myne owne copie taken from me by the Bishops: so that this man may retract what he will and accuse as please him: if he haue anie common honestie / let my former answere be seene. But to proue the Church may be subiect to an other gouernement then Christs / which is euen to say / that a man may gyue all alleageance by outward practize to the Kinge of Spaigne / and yet be her Ma▪ true subiect / He saith / the Church was holden captiue in Babilon / where he as conningly hideth himself as before / though in my last writing I vr∣ged him to answere / whether the Church in Babilō was subiect to their Idolatrie / or no. To the ciuile power I doubt not they were: But if the Priestes and Leuites stood Priests to the Idolatrous worship in Ba∣bilon / whether the people of Israel bowed downe to the outward prac∣tise and obedience of their Idolatrie / or no: then / if they did so / whether they stoode by profession the childrē of God / or apostatate in that estate None of these thinges haue you answeared me. Let the exāples of Ha∣nania / Mishaell / and Azarin testifie Dan. 3. The people that retourned repented their transgressions / wher they had any of them sinned / and made a new couenant with the Lorde / before they were receaued / Ezra 9.14.15. and 10. Cap. 2.3.8. Yea the voyce of God was this / come out of her my people / ād touche no vncleane thing and I wilbe your God. We are before thee (saith Ezra) in our trespasse / and we cannot stand before thee because of it.Esa 52.11 Jerem 51.6.45. You never renounced your Antichristian ministerie / you neuer made newe couenant since the deepe defectiō of Poperye / but still minister in that kingdome / and wil not repent / yet boast your selves to be the Church of God / cryinge out / the Temple the Temple. I ans∣weare then directlie / that whiles you stād subiect vnto / and practize ād communicate with other orders and gouernments / then Christes / you are not by outwarde professiō the Churches of Christ. I may not with you omitt the worde (willfull) because you persequute the light / and so much higher is your sinne. Here I must forewarne the Reader / with dili¦gēce to consider Mr. Giffords disagreement and mine / he hauing accu∣sed me of a fundamētall heresie (as he calleth it) wheras he himself still maintayneth most grosse errors / wher of I reproued him / yet he persis∣teth / Namely / that the regenerate man may be said to stand in bondage to sinne / by reason of the corruption of the fleshe that is in vs / ād of our vnperfectnes in this life. Then / that one standing in outwarde bondage to opē knowē sinne / may in that estate be accompted and cōmunicated with / as the seruāt of Christ by outward profession / both at one instant: which is asmuch to say / we may be to mās sight / the seruaunt of the de∣uill / and the seruaunt of Christ / both at one tyme / by outward profession: so none should be excōmunicate: none be without / te world ād the church light and darcknes / Christ and Belial / should be mingled togeather. The heresie wherof / he most vniustly and vntruly proclaymeth to be mainteyned by vs / is / that the regenerate man consenteth not to sinne / after regeneration / although in the last writinge I testified the cōtrary: Namely that the whole church might erre / might cōmitt some kinde of
Idolatrie / that no mā was free from cōmitting sinne etc. And now I testifie to all the world / that I was neuer infected with anie such An∣abaptistry, but haue euerie where resisted such dannable heresie. I haue learned and taught manie degrees of sinne / and differēces of trāsgressi∣ons / which the deare children of God fall into / after regeneration / in thought word and deed / of ignorance / of knowledge / of presumptiō / slip∣pes / transgressions / and obstinate sinne: Yea that ther is no sinne / except ehe sinne against the Holy Ghost / but Gods childrē / may cōmitt it after regeneration / and be renued by repentance / which we ought to pray for in all sinners / but that one sinne except. Not that men should herevpon take boldnes to sinne / because God giueth repētance to his elect / wher∣in the riches of his mercy appeareth / but rather serue him in trembling and feare / as a iealous God / least with Esaw we find no place to repen∣tance / though we seeke yt with teares. Againe / though in Gods sight / his elected are neuer forsakē vtterlie / nor the Holy Ghost vtterly extin∣guished in the repenerate / yet to mans iudgment he that cōmitteth opē knowē sinne / and persisteth obstinatly in the same / cannot be held the child of God to vs / by outward profession / but must be cutt of Nombers 15.27.31. Math. 18.17. and 1. Cor. 5. till they repent: Much more none that stād opē professed mēbers of te false church / subiect by the least out∣ward bowing downe to this antichristiā Hierarchie, ād so cōtinuing in bō¦dage to a false gouernmēt / cā be holdē of vs te true professors of Christs Gospel. Now let vs peruse te seueral doctrines. Mr. Gifford affirmeth / that the true church migt stād in bōdage to a false gouernmēt / yet in that estate be helde / and cōmunicated with / as the true Church / by outward profession: his wordes in waye of proof / be these. They may with St. Paule say / it is no longer I that do it / but sinne that dwelleth in me: for if the yoake wherwith he was held captiue in part / could not take from him / but that he was the Lordes free seruaunt / it is no reasō that some outwarde bondage should make the Church not to be the spouse of Christ. If a man commaund his wife (saith he) to do a thinge / and ther be violent force to withhold her / shee is not to be blamed. Rom. 7. Mine answere to this he durst not print / but peruerteth my wordes / so manie as pleaseth him / nether can I yet come by a copie of my former writing to shew / what I thē replyed. Now consider what gouernmnet is / and what bondage is / and then behold the wickednes of this man: Spiritu∣all gouernmet is that souereigntie / Dominion: and regiment that Christ Iesus / by his spirit / lawes / ordināces / and officers / exerciseth in ād ouer hys church / as yt is writtē: And thou Bethleē Iuda art not the least among the Princes of Iuda, for out of thee shall come a gouernour that shall gouer¦ne my people Israell. againe / thy Scepter is an uer lasting Scepter. I haue set my king vpon Syon my Holy mountaine, Mat. 2.6. Psa. 2. and 45. and 110. these lawes ād ordināces wherby this kinge raigneth / are caled a king∣dome that cānot be shakē Heb. 12.28.Mal 12.6 they that haue not him to reigne ouer thē / are by outward professiō none of his. If I be your lord, where is my honor? againe those myne enimies which would not that I should reigne ouer thē, bring bether, and slay thē before me. Luke 19.27
Also bondage or seruitude is to be al commaundement / and to yeild o∣bedience in subiection. Now to be in outward bondage to an other out∣ward government / other lawes / officers / and ordinances then Christs / is to be by outward subiection servantes of Antichrist / which layeth an other foundation: for by outward profession we cannot stand (to mans iudgment) professed subiects to two kings at enimitye / But we must be an enimie to the one / and so esteemed of all mē / much lesse members vn∣to two divers heades. This then is mine answere here. 1. That it is an heresie to say a man may stand in bondage to open knowen sinne / and the free seruaunt of Christ to vs by outward profession / both at one instant. 2. That it is a falsifying of the Scripture / to say that St. Paul (in the 7. to the Roma∣nes) was in bondage to sinne / when he / in the inner man resisted sinne / and daylie preuailed against the sinne / which his flesh would haue led him captiue in / if there had not beene a stronger power to ouercome that enimie. For he ther reasoneth of the benefite of the lawe / to mani∣fest our sinne / and our conquest ouer sinne by daylie repentance / and re∣prouing of sinne in our selues / fighting against sinne / victory ouer sinne / thoughe yt contynuallie rebell. 3. How blasphemous were yt to conty∣nue in knowen sinne / in bondage to yt / and to say / it is sinne that dwel∣leth in vs / and not we / and so still to blesse our selves without amende∣ment. O horrible peruertinge of the Scriptures to mens destruction. 2. Pet. 3.16.4. That ther is no Argument to be drawen / nor consequen∣ce to followe / from the reliques of sinne / and corruption of the fleshe in one man / or the whole Church / and a professed bondage to al false go∣vernment: no not betweene the open committing of sinne in the whole Church / or some mmbers therof / and a professed homage and subiecti∣on vnto a false gouernment / we cannot be partakers with the false Church and true / at no hand. 1. Cor. 10.21 / 5. Lastlie / that the subiection to an other gouernement / is as a wife that committeth adulterie. Hosea 2. I then reason thus on the contrary with you. Any man that after re∣generation committeth open knowen sinne / and contynueth obstinate / as a bond seruaunt thervnto / standeth not the professed seruaunt of Christ / but of synne Ezechiel. 18. till he repent / so the whole Church / that persisteth in open knowen sinne / and persequuieth the messengers that reproue the same. Then / as euerie member of the false Church standeth a professed seruaunt of sinne / so the whole assemblies that stand profes∣sed subiects of false gouernment / no censures sf admonition belonging vnto them / but calling of them to repentance and seperation from the false Church. Then / as the wife that geueth her self to be one with an other man / is an adulteresse Rom. 7.3. so that Church that subiecteth herself to an other gouernment / ordinances / and lawes then Christs / is an harlot. Now lett all men say / whether I had not iust cause to say / you spake like a carnall libertine / and an Athiest▪ yea nowe / as one having his conscience eared / to affirme / that the Church / remayninge in open
knowe bondage to a false gouernment / may saye as Paul said / it is not I that sinne. And / that contynuing in that adulterie / she is the spouse of Christ by outward profession. You would saye it were a false Ar∣gument / to say / the Church hath manie imperfections / ignorances / transgressions etc. therfore standeth in bondage to sinne / nay standeth in bondage to an other heade / and an other government then Christs / Euen so / to saye the Church doth sinne / therfore may contynue in bon∣dage to sinne / is false doctrine: nay / to say it may stand in open pro∣fessed subiection to Antichrist / and be esteemed the CHURCH of CHRIST by outward profession in that estate / is damnable doc∣trine. It is the flat contradiction of all the rules of the Scripture / to say / a man may stand in bondage to sinne / and the free servaunt of Christ by outward profession / by mans iudgment / at one tyme / seing the obsti∣nate offenders are to be cast out of the assemblie: But nowe / though the regenerate may fall into these highe sinnes / and contynue in their sinne a long time / yea manie yeares depriued of GODS grace / to mans seeming / and to vs is the seruant of Satan for anie thing wee see / yet the Spirit of GOD is never vtterlie extinguished or departed / after regeneration / but will recouer the man againe / and bring him to repentance / as David after a whole yeare / for the stronge man once di∣splaced and cast out by a stronger then he / the spirit neuer vtterly de∣parteth againe / for then yt were impossible that mā should be renewed Mat. 1.2.31. Heb. 10.26 and 6.4. And herevpon I might saye / Paul never contynued captiue in sinne / but was alwaies renewed by repentance. Furder / this spirit of God (the sparkes wherof were never quenched vtterlie) did not / nor could not consent or giue place vnto sinne / for here is the enimitye and battel betweene the spirite and the flesh / euerie where spoken of Gal. 5,16.17. Rom. 7. May I not now say then / that Paul never contynued capti∣ue vnto sinne / nor consented vnto sin concerninge the Inner man or ga∣ve place vnto sinne in that place mentioned / without heresie: And still reproue you / that when Paul reasoneth of the old man / or corruption in him / you will conclude yt of the new man / or inner man / and of the whole man / when you see euidently / he opposeth the one against the other: For whiles the spirit striueth against sinne / and raigneth in vs / thoughe the fleshe rebell / and cause vs to sinne seauen times a daye / yet are we not ouercome of sinne / so to remayne in bondage to sinne / that it should contynue to reigne in vs / as you may see in the same chapter Rom. 7.5.6. Where you alleage then / that Paul saw a lawe in his mem∣bers / which did lead him captiue vnto sinne / you do falsifie the text: for he saith leading me captiue / and not did leade etc. for ther was a stron∣ger man / or a stronger then man / that suffered not the lawe of his mem¦bers to reigne: for saith he / I my self in my minde serue the law of God / but in the flesh the law of sinne / so that the whole man could not be said to serue sinne. But (say you) afterward as concerning then the
inner man we may be said to serue the lawe of God / and thervpon be called the free seruantes of Christ / notwithstanding this corruption of sinne in the flesh: So the whole man by reasō of our imperfectnes may be said to be the servants of sinne. No / yt is not true / for the whole man is called after the part thath hat greather rule in vs: as if the fleshe rule in vs / we are the servaunts of sinne / and ledd by Satan at his pleasure / but if the Spirit rule in vs / we are the seruauntes of God / Sonnes of God / Sainctes of God / Citizens of Ierusalem / holie and free people / Kinges / and Priests: not that we are perfect / or sin∣ne not / but that sinne reygneth not in vs / but the spirit / wherby we sup∣presse sinne / reprove sinne / striue against sinne / subdue sinne / and though we fall seuen times / yet we rise againe by repentance / and serue not sin∣ne. Rightly therfore did I saye / that no man can serve two masters: for his servantes we are to whom we gyue  our selues as seruants to obey / whether yt be of sinne / vnto death / or of obedience / vnto righteous¦nes. Rom. 6.16.18. being made free from sinne / we are made the ser∣vantes of righteousnes: So that the regenerat man / or he that is by outward profession the servant of Christ / cannot be called the ser∣vant of sinne / by reason of the couption of the old man / and dregges of sinne / neither can he that standeth in bōdage to anie sinne / and giueth himself ouer to yt / be called in that estate the servant of Christ / till he re∣pent / but the servant of sinne. 2. Pet. 2.19. Therfore you must recant your false interpretation of Paul in the 7. to the Rom. and cease your blasphemous raylings / in calling the trueth of God / the rocke of Brownisme. And consider the height of your sin∣ne / by concluding a bondage vnto sinne of the wholeman / for the corrup¦tions of the fleshe / which through the worke of the Spirit is daylie subdued / though never vtterly rooted out of our earthlie members: and from the committing sinne through frayltie / an obstinate professed bon¦dage to the false Church / false gouernment / false ministerie etc. which is plainly the marck of the Beast / to whom with outward obedien∣ce they bowe downe / and stand servants in his kingdome Revel. 14.9.11.12. As for the 4. of the Galat. 26. where the Apostle saith / Ierusalem which is aboue is free with her Children / yo udurst not open yt / nor expound yt / but blaspheame / raile / and sclander / as though we should pleade for such a freedome / as should detract from Magistrates lawfull aucthorities / from having Gods ordinances established by commaun∣dement vpon the Church etc. yea / that we should hold Anabaptisticall freedome / as though we had power not to committ / or consent vnto sin¦ne wheras we haue euerie where by practise and protestation / by word and writing testified to our Souereigne Prince / and to all men / the con∣trary. But Satan that old accuser and detracter of Gods children / to deceaue the world / sendeth out such lyinge spirites to deface the trueth. We / with all subiection and willinge obedience to our souereigne. Prin∣ce / teach all men their obedience to the higher powers: Subiectes to
Magistrates / Flocke to Ouerseers / children to Parētes / wines to their husbands / servantes to their Masters etc. in all things in the Lorde: and if they commaund vs anie thing contrary to the lawe of God / we then patientlie suffer without resistance / or rebellious thaughtes: The freedome then we haue to speake of here / which Christ hath purchased for vs / is / first that triumphe ouer Hell / Deathe / ād damnatiō / through the merites of Christ apprehended by faith / wayted for in hope / Rom. 8. Secondly / that because we were sonnes by election / he giueth vs the spirit of adoption / and sanctification / wherebie we mortifie the fleshe / have reigne and dominion ouer sinne / that yt shall never reigne in vs more vnto condemnation / repenting daylie our trespasses / and crauing pardon for our hidden sinnes / and secret faultes. Thirdly / we are throughe the same spirit and worde of trueth deliuered from all subiec∣tion of Antichist / of the false Church / false ministerie / false gouernment etc. And. they that haue not this freedome / are not by outward profes∣sion the seruauntes of Christ. Furder / we haue freedome from all tra∣ditions of men that seing we are bought with a pryce / we are no longer seruants of men / to be in bondage to anie beggerly rudimentes or devi∣ses of mē / but in all peaceable maner / to worship and serve God within the limites of our callings / according to the word of God / as yt is reue∣aled vnto vs: We haue freedome to speake the trueth with all bold∣nes / though all men should inhibite vs: we would not haue the doctri∣ne limited / stinted / bought and sold / for Iewishe tythes or mercenarie stipendes. We have freedome to seperate from such false▪ Prophetts as your self / to come out of Babel etc. And in the true Church to reproue and withstand anie sinne or traditions of mē in due order / only to be guided and gouerned by Christes lawes and ordināces: In all this I trust you shall not find anie Anabaptistrie in the freedome we professe: this is the truth of the Gospell / wherbie we are made free. Thus then we still affirme / that they which stand in open knowen bondage to sinne / are the seruants of sinne / and not of CHRIST / till they repent / by outward profession. Furder / that allwhich stand mem∣bers of your parish assemblies / stand not members of CHRIST by outward profession / but in bondage to a false and Antichristian ministery / gouernment / worship etc. and the bond woeman and her sonne must be cast out. Furder / for all liturgies, and other devises of mē besides the canonicall Scriptures and liuely graces of his Spirit / we hold they ought not to be brought into the publique assemblies / nor im¦posed vpon mens consciences: But if anie will write such / or reade such / let yt be for their private vse / as all other mens writings: we despise not any directions by word or writing / that may furder vs anie way to the practize of GODS ordinances / yet may they nether be im∣posed vpon mens consciences / not be made a part of GODS worship.
The Lorde therfore that hath thus far fourth discouered the haff and mist of Antichrists delusions / euen to babes and sucklings / publish the glorious light of his blessed Gospell / that the people may see the counterfeit iuglinges of all such false Prophetts / and come out from a∣mongst them / that you may be ashamed of your execrable wares / and forsake your Romish Priesthoode / and gyue glory to God / that yet of∣fereth grace. Amen. Christs vnvvorthie vvitnes for the truth of his Gospell IOHN GREENVVOOD. FINIS.
A Fewe obseruations of Mr. Giffards last cavills about stinted read prayers / and devised Leitourgies. HAving hertofore written an answere to Mr. George Giffards pre∣tended defence of stinted read praiers and devised Leitourgies / and since receiued an emptie replie / wherin he doth nothing lesse then yeild to any sound reason alledged / but vngodlily cauilleth at and peruersly wresteth the sence of so much as he toucheth / I seeing no cause of fur∣ther strife (his former convinced) to intermedle againe with perticular handling of his chaffe and smoke / his reasons in effect the same before āswered / haue only thought it my dutie to illustrate vnto the Readers / some few brief poincts abused by him / that they may the better be able to iudge of the former writings / where vnto with these few helpes fol∣lowing I refer the trial. WHeras I alledged out of the 8. to the Rom. and out of the 4. to the Galath. that in the verie time and action of our praying to God / the spirit of God was the on∣ly help / no other help mentioned or that can be collec∣ted in the Scriptures / Mr. Giffard having granted that reading pra∣yer is not praying / doth now answere / that howsoeuer the Scriptu∣re doth extol and magnifie outward helpes and meanes, yet when they are compared with God which worketh all in all by them, or when the Scripture will set forth the efficacie and worke to be his alone, they are either not mentioned, or els if they be mentioned, so cast downe, as if they were nothing. God buyldeth his Church (saith he) by the ministerie of men, yet Paul is said to plant, Apollos to Water, but God to gyve the encrease 1. Cor, 3. and therfore to gather from those places Rom. 8. Gala▪ 4. that there neede or may be no outward help or meanes in the verie action and instant of praying, is far awrye. In which answer it euidētly appeareth he is so bent to turne away all truth and raise new strife / as ther can be no expectation of agreement: There is no sequence / neither doth the scripture alledged prove his owne reasō / so that nothing hāgs togeather. No mā doubteth but that sometimes and in some places of scripture the outward meanes of begetting and encreasing faith is on∣ly recited / ād sometimes the secret work of Gods spirit only / sometimes both / when yet they are not diuided but goe together / ād all of God both inward worke and outward meanes / though in way of comparison I never so read / but rather the one repeated for both: For shal I say / that when the work of God and preaching therof is shewed to be the power of God vnto saluation / that the inward worke of the Spirit is therfo∣re not mentioned / because the other is of God? then both inward and
outward meanes being of God / ād Gods owne worke / though the one by instrument / that there is silencing of the one in way of cōparison / is not true. But all this is nothing to our matter: He should plainly haue affirmed / that frō these places Rō. 8. ād Gal. 4. it cānot be proued / that in the very instāt tyme ād actiō of owre praying to God / the spirit only instructeth / without outward helpes of instruction / and he should haue seene I could proue (as thē I did) the contrarie vnto him Rō. 8.26. The spirit doth together supplye or help our infirmities for we knowe not what to pray as we ougt, but the spirit yt self maketh request for vs with sighes ād grones vnvtterable. In the actiō of praying the spirit is here set dow¦ne in this place to be the meanes and help of instructiō / teaching vs to aske aright / no other meanes or helpes of instruction in that instant ti∣me and action of praying mentioned in this or any other place of scrip∣ture: Therfore in the time of our praying and laying our hearts opē to God / the Spirit only doth instruct and openeth our mouth. In this place let the word synanilambanetai be wel considered. Againe Gal. 4.6 it is said because yee are sonnes, God sent the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts crying, Abba, Father, The Argumēt here is the same thet before: this word (crying) sheweth the worcke of his Spirit or rather office / in our continuall occasions of prayer to direct vs to vnburden and vnfold the heart / so that in the instāt action we see no other. And where I she∣wed him that reading in the actiō of praying could not be caled an help of instructiō at that time whē we were powring forth our hearts vnto God / the eyes and hāds lyft vp to heaue / our meditation fixed vpō our knowē occasions / and heart and mouth vnfolding thē / my reason this / That the minde and bodie could not be intent vpō two diuerse distinct and seueral exercises and duties of minde and bodie at one time and in∣stāt / he inverteth my words / and stealeth thē as a new shift to help him self (as he supposeth) returning thē thus in way of question / demanding whether fasting / lyfting vp our eyes and hāds to heauē / prostrating the bodie and kneeling be praier yt self / or outward meanes and helpes to make the prayer more fervēt. Euery simple mā wil laugh at him (saith he) if he make thē prayer ytself: ād if they be helpes / thē I haue brought the former proofes not frō an idle / but from an vnsound brayne. Leaue scorning and reproch / and consider what helpes we did al this time in∣treate of was yt not instructiō of the minde by some other spiritual exer¦cise then prayer in praying / wil he call fasting / kneeling etc. instructions of the minde what to pray? thē he must needs plead for his Image and al poperie / if these bodily actions and gestures be instructiō of the min∣de / which are but preparations to make the body serviceable ād apt to ād in this dutie. Further / how learnedly he disputeth to make reading one of these bodily gestures or bodily actions only / let it be cōsidered of. And as he cōfoundeth these bodily exercises and spirituall exercises / so he sheweth himself ignorant and vnable to discerne spiritual gyftes and exercises one from an other / with the distinct vse of them: demanding whither the voyce of an other tha prayeth / be an outward help or
prayer yt self / an outward meanes to make our prayer more fervent. He thinketh I will be laught at / if I say it be prayer yt self. Sure if in anie assemblie / or where two or three are in Christs name gathered together epitouto and homothymadon vnto the same thing and with one minde / for avoyding confusion they do vse but one voice / and that by Gods order and commandement / the others hearts going with the wordes ād saying Amen, they that heare pray not as wel as he that ac∣cording to Gods ordinance speaketh / our publique prayers are not the prayers of the Church / but of him that speaketh only. But now God hath otherwise taught 1. Cor. 14. ād Acts. 4. yt must needs be / that Mr. Giss. is in great error to thinke none but he that speaketh prayeth. I take then such hearing of an others voyce / praying / ād this to be a fou∣le error to publish the contrarie but that prayer both edifieth him that speaketh and him that heareth / and together in heart prayeth / I make no doubt. Yet herevpon to affirme / that here are other meanes of in∣struction to be vsed in the instant action of praying then praying yt self / were as grosse as the other / and both a confounding of spiritual exerci∣ses / and flat contradiction of the Scripture / especially so diverse weigh∣tie actions of minde and bodie / as proseuche, ād anagnosis, powring out our hearts to God in prayer / and reading. At other times I did not on¦ly allow / but teach / that we haue al the dayes of our lyves need to be in∣structed to pray aright / and that reading is a blessed meanes therevn∣to. So that you see whiles you of purpose will oppose / you runne your self vpon the rocke: in stead of justifying your accusatiō of two heresies to be found in my first reason / you haue published this follie / which you must retract / if you wil obey the truth. Mr. Giffard thē granting / that reading is but to help to prayer and not praying / ād now being shewed that it cā be no help in that instant action of praying / let vs proceede to pervse an other of his mistakings and willful peruertings. I affirming that the holy Ghost neuer enioyned vs to any certaine nūber of words by stint and limitatiō in praying / as commanding the very words to be said ouer whē we pray / he euery where in his wrytings as a supposed foundatiō to their Leitourgie and Collects / alledged out of Numbers the 6. Mat. 6. Lu. 11. exāple of Psalmes / ād now Deu. 26. that the Lord did by cōmādemēt binde thē to those verie words saiing ouer / whē they prayed or blessed in those formes which are there prescribed. For my reasons in disproving this popish carnal cōceipt / I refer the Reader to my former answeare to his plublished pretended defence of reading for praying. One reasō was drawē frō the words of the text Numb. 6.32. where the hebrew words Coh Tebarau, thus shal you blesse / do not im∣port a tying thē to the verie words of this forme in blessing / but to the rules and instructions there taught them concerning the matter yt self for their direction / which I collected by this word Coh, which is an ad∣verb of similitude / signifiing with vs as much as (after this maner) and therfore cānot be o say the same words / but according to the same in∣structions. Where first he reprocheth me for that Tebaracu was false
printed / therevpon chardging me I cannot reade twoo words right of hebrue / which were no great ignominie in their priesthood: But shall we say Mr. Giff. cannot reade two words in latine rightly / because in the 28. page of his booke he repeateth out of Augustine / upoli sui / for po¦puli sui? This I mention / as sory to see the defendor of his false Hierar∣chie so emptie / to leaue founde doctrine / and thus to trifle: if he had bene at the print / it should haue bene amēded it seemeth. Now to the doctri∣ne gathered of this word Coh. Mr. Gif. would invert the words in his owne sēse / thus: that where I said / the Lord did not cōmaund to say the same words but the like / that is according to those directions of doctri∣ne / he gathereth / that I should affirme yt vnlawfull to vse those words at all / yea that they might not vse all or anie of these words at anie ty∣me. Whether this be a Christian interpretation of my words or no / I leaue not only to all mens / but chieflie to his owne conscience to be con∣sidered. Yet he still couertly persisting in his error / produceth a place of scripture / where the word Coh (as he thinketh) is vsed for the saying of the verie words. Exod.;. The Lord said to Moses / Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel Eheie hath sent me vnto yee / moreouer God said vnto Moses / thus shalt thou say vnto them / The God of your Fa∣thers etc. According to Mr. Grenewoods interpretation (saith he) Mo∣ses is not commanded to say those words / but the like. True / he is not here bound to this certeine number of words / or the same words. If then they should say / what is his name that hath sent thee / he may not say Eheie hath sent me / because God said Coh etc. Now Mr. Giffard sheweth himself ashifter: I did neuer hold it vnlawfull to vse anie wor∣des of the Scripture as need required / it is your sclander: where you have in all your bookes affirmed we hold it vnlawfull to say thy king∣dome come / or vse anie phrase of Scripture to right vse: your woeful wresting of the tongue for vntruthes / wil tourne to your further iudg∣ment. I proued only by the word Coh, which signifieth (after this ma∣ner) that God commaunded not the very certaine number of words to be said. And where I sayd the word Coh was so vsed in all the Prophets (when they say / Thus saith the Lord) to this end / that neither the holy Ghost had registredal their verie words they spake▪ nor that they were tyed to the prescript number of words / he would haue it thought I should hold those words which are recorded / not to be the words of God / which wresting of my words / is but his emptie quarreling to tur¦ne away this firme doctrine: namely / that God did in those formes of prayer mentioned by him / prescribe the somme of their blessings ād pe∣titions / whervnto they ought according to their seuerall occasions wi∣thin the limits of these doctrines / frame their suites and desires / ād did not tye them to a certaine number of words. Now he finding himself pressed / in that al his proofes are at once brought to be weapōs against him rather then warrant / It being prooved vnto him that those for∣mes are repeated in other words in other places / and that the Priests
vsed other in blessing the people / as Eli blessed Hanna: also that the Apostles vsed other words in prayer / and neuer that verie forme and number of words / he playnly denyeth that our question was about the bynding and limiting to the verie words by commandement / and saith our question was / whither it were idolatrie to vse those prescript phrases or no. Thus the man is sled / not only contradicting all his writinges / making voide his proofes / but granting as much as I af∣firmed vpon the word COH hath gyven mee the whole cause against is will: For if these places will not serue to prove an apportioning by number and stint vpon commandement / then Mr. Gissard hath no pro¦fe for his Collect / no though these had bene so / yet his patched broken mass booke shoulde haue bene far from comming in place of true pryer. But that this is a popish dreame to think in prayer they were bound to some certeyne number of words saying ouer / it was also conuinced vnto him by the Greeke word Houtos, where Christ commandeth his Disciples saying / When you pray, pray thus, Our Father, &c. Which word Thus Mat. 6.9. singnifieth (after this maner) or according to this forme / rules / and instructions: for if the commandement shoulde goe to bynde vs to the very words / then this word (when you pray) would bynd vs never to vse other words / for the text saith / when you pray, say thus. To this he answereth / that respecting the rules for matters / when is as much as whensoeuer you pray / because we may not depart from those matters conteyned in those general petitions: But in words it is not so there / We must consider to distinguish et3. Wel / hath he not lost himself / and still against his will yeilded the matter: namely that wee are not in these formes of prayer bound to the verie words saying ouer / and that the holy Ghost did neuer by commandement stint or li∣mit vs to anie words in praying / which in deed is common with inchan¦ters: And I take it he will easily yeild me this point / for if he remember Augustine to teach / that then we pray that prayer which Christ taught his Disciples / when our prayers are grounded vpon those doctrines and instructions / or to that effect: And Calvine to say: the Sonne of mā would not prescribe vs what words we must vse in prayer / he should haue put vs to lesse trouble: So that besids his mass-booke was neuer prescribed by the Lord himself or warrant of his word / he seeth it vn¦lawful to apportion / limit and stint as by measure and waight certeine numbers of wordes / sentēces etc. in prayer. As for his examples of the Psalmes: I refer to my former answere / namely / that praying is our thing / and singing a psalme an other. Now then we haue heard that reading is not praying or any help to pray in the instant action of praying / when we should powre forth our owne hearts to God: Also that it is vnlawful to bynde mā to numbers of words or sentences in praying. Let vs come to the first generall ar∣gument / which is this. No Apocrypha must be brought into the publick assemblies / for there only Gods word and the lively voyce of
his owne graces must be heard in the publick assemblies: But mens wrytings and the reading them ouer for prayer are Apocrypha: Ther∣fore may not be brought into the publick assemblies / eyther for lawes or worship. Here hee finds fault with the worde Apocrypha (al∣though it hath bene an antient word in this sense / and now published in their Bibles to distinguish other writings from the authentick scrip¦tures) willing mee to goe to the matter yt self / drawing by firme con∣clusion / that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church / which is not the perfect rule yt self in writing or without errour vttered in speach / and he wil yeild. This I did proue vnto him by an Argument hee was not able to answere / and did leaue out the word Apocrypha, thus. Only the Canonical Scriptures and liuely voice of Gods ow∣ne graces are to be brought into the publick assemblies for doctrine and prayer: But mens writings or Collections are neither Canonical Scripture / nor the liuely voice of Gods graces in such as he hath ap∣pointed to speake in the publick assēblies. Therfore no mans writings may be brought into nor imposed vpon the publick assemblies for doc∣trine and prayer. Now where he cauilleth about the perfectnes of the rule and abso∣lute perfectnes of the graces / it doth not help him: For the word of GOD being of necessitie by the lawe and ordinance of God / to be re∣ad in our owne language / I trust he will not denye yt to be the writ∣ten word of GOD for the vnperfectnes of the translation / being (to the best search the Church can make) skanned by the original tongue and stil amended / or at least the Church no further bound to yt / then yt shal be found to be the perfect rule: so likewise the liuely voice of GODS graces are not for the imperfectnes to be excluded / being Gods appointed ordinance / neither is anie fault in the translation to be allowed / and errour in doctrine or prayer are presently to be admo∣nished and repented of. Maister Giffard then must denye the Bible translated into our owne language to be the Canonicall Scriptures / and denye the liuely voice of GODS lawfull officers / and such as are therevnto called / in doctrine and prayer / to be the manifestations of the Spirit and vtterance of Gods graces for the assemblie / or els grant the proposition firme: And if hee can put dead mens writinges into the place of either of these / I will yeild. In the meane time I hold such translations to be the worde of GOD / and by Gods ordinance put into our owne lāguage / to all our knowledges retayning the words of GOD / which word and the lyuely vse of Gods owne graces in the mouth of such as he therevnto appointeth / are only to be brought into the publicke assemblies for prayer and doctrine / for GOD hath com∣manded these vnto vs as his owne ordinances in his assemblies / and no other means wherby either God speaketh vnto vs / or his people vn¦to him / in the Congregation. To this all the Scriptures beare wit∣nesse / the word is always firme / confirmed with miracles from hea∣uen / and commended to vs by Christ / the Prophetts and Apostles / to be
the foundation / Canon / light / lanterne / etc. the graces of the Spirit gy∣ven for the interpretation / prayer / doctrine etc. Christ is ascended vp into heauen / and hath giuen giftes vnto men to serve their tyme and minister in their place in this house. These graces stil renewed / not only in those called of GOD in this seruice for their dayly administra∣tion / but newe workmen thrust forth into this haruest / as the Lord of the house disposeth: which graces of his Spirit are compared to two oliue branches / which emptie out of themselues thorow two golden pi∣pes. Zacharie 4.12. And to seuen thunders which vtter their voices that cannot be written. Away therfore with your patched mass-boo∣ke / yt may neither stande for a foundation in Gods house / nor for the lyuely voyces of these thunders: you make yt a monstrous Idoll by putting yt in either of these vses / yet you will make yt serve for both. Wee haue nothing to do with your matters of order / as you vnderstād that order for tyme / place / etc. wee reason of the Spirituall action yt self / when wee entreat of the meanes whereby God speaketh to vs / and appointeth vs to speake vnto him. Wee can cast out the errours in the translatiō or doctrine or prayer / and yet reeaine Gods worde in our owne language / and the liuely voice of his graces in the assemblie: When you can do so with your deuises and newe hatched Leitourgies wee will giue eare vnto you and them / till then wee thinck of your coun¦terfeit playes and pleas for your Idolls and detestable sacriledge and high prophanation of GODS ordinances with Iannes and Iam∣bres to resist the truth. Paraphrases wee hold to be mens writinges and expositions / and not the word of GOD / nor the liuely voice of Gods grace of interpretation or prayer / therefore to be excluded this place of service vnto GOD. Thus you see the further you wrastle / the further you make your wares / the best of them / odious to euerie godly conscience. You say I deceiue the simple by gyuing them one crabbe amongst many apples: but you may behold your best apples such as the holy GHOST hath foretold vs Revelation. 18. to be entisements to euil: It is well you will grant my Propositions so sound: and I would wish (if such de GODS wil) they might be bet∣ter sauoured. Nowe because I wil not stand either repeating or contending about Syllogismes / I will take this much yeilded of your owne conclusions / which is as much in effect as I haue affirmed were you teach me thus to reason. No mans writings are the vndoubted truth of God / but haue errours and imperfections: therfore men cannot further ground vpon them / then they be consonant to the Canonicall Scriptures. A∣gaine / The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets: therfore our faith is not to rest vpon mēs writings. Where∣vpon doth necessarily follow / that if mens writings may not be buil∣ded vpon nor rested vpon / howe should you dreame it lawfull to im∣pose them for lawes vpon the publick assemblies / or to haue them there read to beare rule as the wordes of God? And this you confessed
in an other of your writings / that GOD spake vnto vs out of his vn∣doubted worde / or by his owne word. If then GOD speake not vnto vs by mens writinges that be of priuate interpretation / in the assemblie / nor that they can be made groundwork to buyld our faith vpon / or to rest assured vpon / yt will be granted I hope that they are not to be imposed von the publick assemblies as lawes and ru¦les / but left to euerie mans private vse in their libertie / as they will answere for themselues what vse they put them to / and whither they doe not prefer them before the booke of GOD / or preiudice themselves by them. This first poinct is then plaine / That only GODS vndoubted worde is to be imposed / brought in / ād maintay∣ned in the publick assemblies as lawes and rules / no other writings being authentick or Canonical. But here Mr. Giffard doth in effect affirme / that the word of God yt self is not authentick or Canonical / except in the Hebrew or Greeke Copie: Wherin he goeth a litle beyond the Papists / that wil yet allow the worde of GOD in latine: And if it shoulde be defended / that the worde of GOD were not the worde yt self that wee haue in our ow∣ne language / it will follow that no man could haue assurance of faith / except he vnderstoode both Hebrew and Greeke / yea be able soundly to interpret the Scriptures in both. If the translations be so far mens writings that yt ceaseth generally to be the word of GOD that is not written in Hebrew or Greek / and mens writinges not to be grounded or rested vpon / where shall our assurance stand? And might not Mr. Giffard as well say the Hebrew and Greek Copi are but pa∣per ankyck / many faults and errours by the print in vowells / accents letters / and so conclude we had not Authentick or canonicall Scriptu∣res at al / except mens erronious writings might be of equall authoritie in the assemblie that the Scriptures? must he not beare with mee in accompting him an Atheist or Libertine in thus reasoning? Hence then we see whiles you go about to abase the Canonicall Scriptures / and extol your patched Letourgie you fall into manie blasphemies / as I haue before told you. Wee hold yt the word of GOD in what lan∣guage soeuer / stil reiecting the errours in the print / in the translations etc. as they are knowne vnto vs / and not the word y self for the im∣perfections or errours in the translation and print. Now when you can make that which remayneth the vndoubted worde of God / not agrea∣ble only but an Authentick approued Canonicall Scripture / authori∣sed from God to be the verie eternal foundation and rules / limitts and lawes giuen by himself vnto his people you may lift vp your  Dagō into this place / if there be some truth in their writings (as what mens writings haue not some / and the holy name of GOD verie much) yet is that truth in the Scripture yt self and here so mingled with chaffe / that it were not only vnprofitable and a hinderance of the true vse of GODS worde / but an abolishing and defacing of the
word yt self / the maiestie whereof ought to terrifie you from this pre∣sumption. And where you say that you decide not controversies by anie transla∣tion / but by the Authentick Copies of the Hebrew and Greke / I trust you speak only of such as are able by the interpretation thereof so to decide controversies / and holde it not vnlawfull for anie such as haue not that help / to convince errour by the powre of the word and confer∣ring one place with an other in anie translation / according to the analo∣gie of faith / though I grant we ought to vse the best approued. But if this were not lawfull surely no man might prophesie in the Church / which hath not the gift of interpretation of the tongue / neither might any affirme any Scripture to be true but they wich haue knowledg of tongues: How blasphemous is this gare / whiles you are ignorant of the powre / wisdome and agreement of the word and Spirit and diuer¦sitie of giftes giuen vnto men: The Word and the Spirit approue ech other / and beare wness ech of other / in what language soeuer GOD giueth yt / to our vnderstanding. Prophesie and knowledg of tongues are two seueral giftes not alwayes giuen to one member / but distribu∣ted as God in his wisdome hath appointed. 1. Cor. 12. and prophesie commanded for the more excellent Cap. 14. But this is sufficient in this place / that the word of God is the word of God in what langua∣ge soeuer / and to accompt yt being verbatim translated or at least so far foorth faithfully translated / mans writing / were blasphemie: but mens writings can neuer be so holden the authentick Scriptures of God / how agreable to the wo soeuer they be. My argument is then firme / and thus left vpon you: Those writings which be not the word of God being imperfect / and neuer without error / may not be imponed as la∣wes and Canons vpon the publick assemblies / or there be read or inter¦preted / or offred vp in worship: But such are al mens writings that be not the authentick word of God yt self▪ The publick assemblies are on∣ly bound to the reading and interpretation of the Scriptures / which God hath ordeined to be read in a knowne language / ād for prayer and prophesie hath ordeined the liuely voice of his owne graces in the mouth of such as he hath appointed to be the mouth of the Congrega∣tion vnto him ād his mouth vnto thē. So that your patched Leitour∣gie / paraphrases songes in rime / homelies / and al your dead mens wri∣tings / are cast forth of the publick assemblies / and manifest to be Idols when they are thrust into that place. Now where I ledged that the binding of the publick assēblie / yea of all assemblies / to certeyne writings of men euerie day and yeare their number and portion of words daylie mōthly and yearely in al assēblies the same matter and words reiterated in sead of powring forth their hearts vnto God according to their present needs and occasions was a setting of themselves in Gods seate and taking the office of his Spirit / which only knoweth the wantes of the seueral assemblies according to their diuerse occasions / he runneth away from the matter / as one vn∣willing
to heare of this their Tautologia and counteret babling / demā∣ding wheter euerie one should vtter their owne perticular wantes in the publick assemblie / or should pray nothing but that euerie one feeleth the present want of in himself / or should tell the Minister before hand what euerie one of their wantes were▪ then how the Minister should re∣member al. Are these any thing but mre cauils? can any of these follow vpon the former doctrine? And let him looke againe / whether he that is the mouth of the Congregation vnto God in publick prayer / must not consider the present publick occasions of that publick assemblie / and thereafter frame his prayers / all the people ioyning in heart to his words of petition or thanksgiuing / saying Amen to so much as he as∣keth according to the wil of God and neede of the time / yea and if they haue not feeling in such prayers / they are vnfeeling members: yet nei∣ther doth he intermedle with private or secret wātes / neither neede they tell him them he is sent for the publick affaires of the Church / to com∣mend the seueral actions general and publick / vnto God: And as they are diverse in everie assemblie / so must he be a mā of wisdome to know / see / and consider them / lest they al rashly step into the house of God to offer vp the sacrifie of fooles / and make a counterfeit babling Eccle. 4. Yet the sinne of this is nothing comparable to the dong your Priests cast forth by pratling ouer your English Portuis / which the Lord will one day cast in your faces. As then in priuate prayer we are to lay forth our owne wantes and estate of our owne soule / which cannot be done by reading an other mans writings / alwayes singing one song / customa¦bly repeating in superstition certeine words / our hearts neuer ripped vp / examined / nor the diseases therof layd open vnto God / seeking due cure: So the man that is the mouth of the whole assemblie prayeth / as the mouth of one bodie / for al their open publick present wantes and oc¦casions: Which occasions / considering the persons and actions / are di∣verse and cannot be written for one assemblie before hand / muchlesse for all assemblies in a whole kingdome / neither by man nor Angel. See thē the mockerye of your service booke / and what Idolatrie is committed by yt / to the abandoning true prayer according to the present wantes and occasion. The next thing to be cōsidered / is / about making of lawes in the wor∣ship of God. Where he would persuade vs that their whole Leitourgie conteining al their publick worship / gouernmēt / offices and ordinances of their Church / be but matters of order and conveniencie. Then the compelling and teaching the publick assemblie to reade ouer mens wri∣tings both as Canōs and lawes in the Church / ād publickly ād priuate¦ly to offer them vp in stead of true prayer ād holy invocatiō is a matter of comelines and conveniencie. In the meane time it must be a turning away of the whole order and ordināces of God: For what is the whole Testament of Christ but an order for euerie office / person / action in the Church / if he wil haue it taxis and then must confesse their Leitourgie an other order of publick administratiō / and so as I haue said an other
Gospel / an other Testament / a setting vp an other worship. And here∣vpon I trust I may cal al this an adding to the word of God / yea I wil go a litle further / an abolishing and disabling and dishonoring of the word yt self and graces of his spirit. And whither all this smoke of the bottomlesse pyt may not be reproued with these Scriptures / not only Proverb. 30. verse 5.6. Deut. 4. verse. 32, but also Revel. 22. verse 18 19. let the godly ponder and search: and let the fearefulnes of the thre∣ats deterre all flesh from presuming to alter the ordinances / lawes and worship of the most high God. And that the verie reading of an other mans writing for my owne prayer / or the prayer of the Church / in stead of powring foorth our owne hearts / is a changing of the who∣le worship into the making mens writing an Idoll / which is by these places condemned as an accursed sinne: let the most hard text (as he in carnall wonder exclaymeth) be looked into Revel. 22. verse 18.19. The words are plaine: If anie man put or add any thing vnto these / or if anie man take away from these words / he shalbe iudged as followeth. Now if the adding an other whole Worship / and suppressing of that God hath apointed / be not an adding to these things written / gyue sen∣tence as you wil answere. O (saith he) but it is said God wil add vnto such al the plagues writ∣ten in this booke / and there is in this booke mentioned the lake of fire: As though the lake of fire is not due for euery sinne / and yet not euery one that committeth sinne to be condemned / what sinne is it that deser∣ueth not the eternall wrath of God? yet not euery one that sinneth giuē ouer to that iudgmēt / for eiher yt may be of ignorance / or of negligen∣ce / and washed away by repentance in the blood of Christ / or it may be repented of and lest when wee see yt. Mr. Giffard hath read wel the curses of the law and all the curses due for sinne that seeth not how ma∣ny curses the law and the Prophets pronounced vpon sinne / to call the persons themselues to repentance: shewing together the equitie of God law / and yet withal the free mercye of God to al that truly repēt their euil wayes. All that receiue the Beastes marke in their hand or forehead / are thretned to be cast with the Beast and false Prophet into that lake / yet i doubt not but manie that haue bene so seduced into that sinne / shal by repentance be saued: Not that I encourage anie to conti∣nue in such fearful estate / to hardē their hearts against the threatnings of GOD but that I would haue Maister Giffard to put difference betwene the curse layd to the sinne / and condemnation of the per∣son sinning: And seeing he taketh that lake a perticular seuere threat to the Apostasie vnder ANTICHRIST / I would he had the grace to consider how it lyeth vpon him / whiles he speaketh out of the mouth of the Beast / if he repent not to turne from his euil wayes. Let it further be weighed how ignorantly he chargeth me to condem¦ne al Churches / for this finale examplifying of this Egiptian darknes / Idolatrous worship / and exalting mens writings into this defacing of
Gods word and true worship / they neither being guylty of such a sacri¦legious Leitourgie / as this Egiptian Calf hatched at Rome / neither are to be presently iudged no Church for others sinne / till they ioyne obstinacie to their transgression. But shift the matter as you wil / or rather as you can appeare before God / I wil not make lesse the sinne / or the iudgment due to sinne / for mens persons no not of whole Chur∣ches / if they shal be guilty therin: My desire is by discouerie of the sinne / to bring men to repentance / and vnto the awe of God in his wor∣ship: who are guyltie besides your selues in such sacriledge / as to a∣brogate the Leitourgy of Christ / and set vp an other / or to restraine Gods true worship and to giue life to the image of the Beast / it shil∣leth me not: let sinne be sinne / and GOD righteous / and them exa∣mine yourselves / if they or you be cleare I reioyce / neither do I thinck or can charge them with such Idolatrie as is here erected: I take it you wil be found the sclanderer of other Churches / to hide your owne filthines. But saith Mr. Giffard those Scriptures are against the adding of humane preceptes and lawes to be kept as pars of Gods wurship to ind the conscience to seek righteousnes and the forgiuenes of sinnes / or the merit of eternal life in them / or against such rules of gouernment as God hath set to be perpetual. In which we must take your meaning to be this / that you grant where anie humane precepts and lawes be enforced as a part of GODS worship / or as lawes to bind the con∣science / or when righteousnes is sought in them / and forgiuenes of sin∣nes by observing of them or merit by them / or if they be against such rules of gouernment as GOD hath let to be perpetuall / if the addi∣tions or constitutions be such as anie of these then such lawes and con∣stitutions are against the perfection of the word of God / against Chri∣stian libertie / and in the chief things which concerne Gods worship against the ground and foundation of our faith and so a thing most de∣testable and accursed / which our Sauiour CHRIST refused iustly to obserue with the blinde Pharisis / wherein you haue granted as much as I euer affirmed: For is not your whole Leitournie being an other then CHRISTS Testament your whole reading mens writings in place and in stead of laying forth your owne present wantes and occasions in prayer to God humane constitutions / ād made a par∣te of Gods worship? at least such pretended worship as you thinke good enough for him? Weygh the matter vnrightly: Againe / whi∣ther your whole Antichristian gouernment / offices / Courtes and mini∣sterie / be not constitutions and ordinances against such rules of Christs gouernment as be perpetual and an innovating of his Testament / exa∣mine / which you shall soone perceiue / if you looke but what Christs perpetuall ordinances / offices / officers and lawes for the guyding / or∣dering and gouerning of his CHURCH be / prescribing euerie one their place / dutie and limits iointly and seuerally / and not finde your ministerie registered there / but a strange Leitourgie and worship bor¦rowed
from the Pope / which came out of the bottomlesse pit / confesse your sacriledge in suppressing CHRISTS whole ministerie and ordinances / and erecting an other for the perpetuitie of his / euen to euerie naile and pn: The holy Ghost sheweth that only to be his mi∣nisterie / till we be all a perfect body in him / and his whole ministerie and ordinances a kingdome that cannot be shaken. Hebre. 12. Ephes. 4. a commandement to be kept vndefiled till the apearing of IESUS CHRIST: his Scepter an euerlasting Scepter / the Sonne as faithfull in his house as Moses a servant in the Tabernacle / who made all things according to the paterne: So that it is to be wondred Mr. Giffard should think anie part of Christs gouernment should not be perpetuall / that was giuen by his Apostles the master buylders and lay¦ers of the foundation / wherby all actions should be tried to the worlds end. May not Mr. Giffard as wel cal into question the perpetuite of the Testamēt / as the lawes and rules for the governmēt of his Church. Now if your whole false Hierarchie / Offices / Officers / Lawes / Wors∣hip / be plainly other then Christs / as in our other writings are proued / and shame will inhibit you to deny / how can you be so drunke with the cup of the Whores fornication / to think you haue no constitutions / la∣wes or traditions / which are a part of worship / and against such rules of Christs gouernment as the Apostles haue prescribed for the ordring of his howse / and the same ordeyned for all Churches til we become all a perfect bodye in him? But if Mr. Giffard wil shew himself so voide of al consciēce ād truth to say al their traditionall worship and Antichristian Offices and ordi∣nances be neither part of their worship nor constitutions disanulling the ordinances of Christ / yet wil he confesse I doubt not this kinde of worship and gouernment to be imposed as matters to binde the consciē∣ce / being all the seruice of God they haue / seeing hee woulde also haue al that obserue them not / to be censured and excommunicat for this mar∣chandize: yt were a sore matter a man should be cut of from Christ and his Church / gyuen ouer to Satan / and the iudgment ratified in he∣auen against soule and bodye / for a matter that byndes not the conscien∣ce / As though the soule and bodye (howsoeuer some things perteine to the one / or is done by the one as proper worke there of) were not both to be counted when the conscience shalbe opened to answere for all done in both / or by eyther of both / even whatsoeuer wee haue done in soule and bodye: and Calvine would but diuide the soule and the bodye in Ciuile causes. But Maister Giffard would goe a note further  na∣mely / that in the seruice of GOD in such causes as the transgres∣sion deserue excommunication / to be no matter bynding the con∣science. But it may be Maister Giffard doth suppose / that except the consti∣tutions ecclesiasticall be such, as righteousnes be commanded to be sought in the doing them, and forgiuenes of sinnes and merit by them, all is wel. Then / besides the other hbuses granted / he must de demanded
whither those traditions of the Fathers / which our Sauiour Christ and his Disciples refused to observe / were imposed as meritorious / whervnto wee answere / No: For in the superstitious washings of cup∣pes / of beddes / with al such trincketts / wee see to be no such matter Marke 7. and Christs words in saying / they layde the commandements of God aside to set vp their owne traditions / doth shew wherin the sin∣ne was: namelie / to do and observe such things of vaine glorie / supersti∣tion / or custome as God had not inioyned them / and to leaue vndone the lawes and commandements of God / which sinne is your transgression at this day: Reade therfore the 7. of Marke / and 15. of Mathew more diligently. Further those superstitious traditiōs Gal, 4. and Colos. 2. the observing wherof were the denyall of Christ / were neither held merito∣rious / nor iustification sought by them / manie of them being Iewish ce∣remonies / sometimes as rudiments commanded of God / now abolished and no further burden to be layde in such outward thinges / no / We rea∣de not that the law of God yt self was eyther commanded / or so obser∣ved / as to seeke righteousnes by yt. Now then to the matter: Mr. Giff. thinketh Christ and his Apostles did well in refusing to obey the traditions of the Fathers at the Pharisies commandement, and so must confesse it law¦ful and a dutie of vs to refuse to observe your Iewish cerimonies and Romish superstitious traditions / which are so manie as euen your whole Leitourgie and worship conteine nothing els / Gods lawes and ordinances not only left vndone but al that pleade for them and seeke to walke in them / persecuted with deadly hatred. And how Mr. Giffard will proue that there is no adding or diminis∣hing to or from the word of God / by imposing and creating more la∣wes thē God hath made in his worship and gouernmēt of his Church / but such as bee made part of the worship / or bynde the consciēce / or bee meritorious / or against such rules of his gouernment as bee perpetuall though I take all your orders / lawes / worship in this compasse / yet howe you can poue this / I know not / for looke againe vpon the scriptu¦res Pro. 30.5.6. Deut. 4.2. and 12.32. and Gal. 3.15. Revel. 22.18.19. and you shal finde / that to add / superordeine / innovate or diminish or take anie thing from the lawes of God already prescribed for his worship / were to abrogate his lawe / to laye further burdens then hee hath layde to make his lawe vnperfect / and set our selves in his seate / yea whatsoe¦uer wee put to which hee hath not commanded / or whatsoeuer wee in∣hibit that hee hath commanded / is here forbidden: For this saith the Lorde / Ye shall put nothing vnto the word which I command you, neither shall you take ought therefrom that you may keepe the preceptes of the Lorde your God which I commande you Deut. 4.2. And that this was as well in the outwarde ordināces of the Temple as in the iudgments / is plaine in the first verse. Againe in the 12. Chap. 32. Whatsoeuer I com∣mand you, take heede you do yt; Thou shalt put nothing therto nor take anie thing therfrom: and in the Proverbs. Euerie word of God is pure, put nothing vnto his wordes lest hee reproue the ād thow bee found a lyer. Now
the scripture speaking so absolutely and generaly against al addition or detraction to or from his ordinances / Mr. Giffard ouershooteth him∣self of his bare word to contradict and limit so expresse commandemen∣tes / for these Scriptures (saith hee) are against adding of humane pre∣ceptes and lawes to bee kept as partes of Gods worship / to bynde the conscience to seeke righteousnes / forgeuenes of sinne / merit in them / or against such rules of gouernmēt as God hath set to be perpetuall. This is true / but this is not all / for the lawe is generall against all inventiōs / traditions / constitutions / whatsoeuer God hath not commanded / as the second Commandment doth also teach. Thou shalt not make to thy self etc. so that God hath left nothing to be layde vpon his Church by com∣mandement / Which he hath not commanded: And therfore that place of the Apostle to the Gal. 3.15. must be better pervsed: If it be but a mans Testament when yt is confirmed no man doth abrogate yt or superordeine anie thing to yt: CHRISTS Testament then being much more per∣fect / his whole minde for the ordering of his house manifested ther∣in / it is wicked presumption to alter the ordinances thereof / or to holde them vnmeete or vnsufficient for anie age or estate. Well Mr. Giffard coulde nowe bee content thus far to limit the po∣wer of the Church: namelie / to haue her subiect and obedient to his voice: but that he supposeth there may be lawes ecclesiastical made / of things in themselues indifferent: that where the scripture hath com∣manded such things to be vsed at our libertie for order / for comelynes / edification and glorye of God / as matters of place / time / and such cir∣cumstance. But hee here mistaketh his text / for the Lorde comman∣deth by the Apostle in that place / . Corint. 14. that those publique busi∣nes and exercises of the assemblis / shoulde be done in order / in comly∣nes / to edifying / and doth not leaue somthing to bee commanded / which the maister buylders hath not prescribed: For to binde those thinges by lawe which God hath not bound in his worship / were to add newe traditios to bring vs into bondage of the creatures / which the same Apostle denyeth euer to bee brought into bondage vnto 1. Cor. 6.12. in his owne person teaching vs so to walke: the Lord see in his wisdome cause to leaue them in our libertie / knowing there woulde bee no end of such perticular lawes / especially if he had left it to mans wyt to make and vnmake lawes therin: For the orders you speake of then / mea∣ning circumstances of time / place / kneeling / sitting / standing etc. there can be no further lawes of them / then the Apostle hath set / and (as the Minister of Christ prescribed) that al be donne to edifying in comlynies / order / etc. Of theis to set perticular lawes / were to break these generall lawes of God / whereby he teacheth vs the true vse of them / and lea∣ueth them in the Churches libertie as need requireth to vse them or not vse them: Neither can all assemblies bee bound in these thinges to the same in perticular / that being needfull and decent in one / that is not in an other. And in that you woulde haue them no further commanded / then they bee needfull / convenient / decent etc. you condiscend that
there can bee no setled lawe in perticular layde vpō the Church in thē: For to vse them so far as they bee convenient / necessarie / and to edifijng is the lawe and commandement of God: and to vse them further at anie mans commandement / were both a breach of Gods lawe / and making the creatures stumbling blockes / Idolles / bondages / and euerie way sinnefull. And when the Church commandeth them so far to be vsed as they are commanded of God / the Churche doth but ratifye and see GODS lawe executed: so that you haue lost your selfe / whiles you sholde haue proued your bold affection: That the Church hath power to ordeyne lawes / for to create or make lawes / which you see the folly of / being nowe driuen to another shift: that in the perticular thinges whereof GOD hath giuen generall lawes / wee may make setled lawes / and yet but for the tyme they be convenient: Wheras in deed GODS lawe is the same and nothing ells. But because they bee necessarye in one place / that bee not in another / at one tyme / that bee not at another / of somme persons / that bee not to other / ther can bee no lawe sett in the perticular one daye for all assemblies in such thin∣ges. Neither shall anye disagrement bee such amongst the seuerall Churches / as need anye contention for them / whiles euerie assem∣blye doe that wich is to themselues most meet / most convenient and necessary in such things / for the present tyme. The Pastor and El∣ders were of small discretion if they might not haue these thinges in their libertie: and even these doctrines and examples are in this point against your selfe / which you haue alledged from other CHUR∣CHES. But my purpose is not to contend about mens writings / nor to be drawen into controuersie with other Churches / when I am to deale with your present sinne / for the auoiding wherof you thus ra∣ge. If your cause be good / plead it by the Scriptures / and I wilbe so farre from casting out darts against al CHURCHES / as I wil not deale with their estate / till I be further occasioned / the ra∣ther may I omitt this labour / for that you haue alledged one place of scripture which you suppose wil beare vp all your matter: If yt helpe you not / I see not how you wil defend your assertion. In the 15. of the Acts where it is said the Apostles / Elders / and bre∣thren at Ierusalem met about the question of Circumcision and other Ceremonies of Moses lawe / which some would haue burdened the Gentiles with / we see there (saith he) that the Apostles themselves did decree some thing for the time / which afterward were to be altered when the occasion was taken away / namelie / that the Gentiles should absteyne from blood / and from strangled / for auoiding offence to the weak Iues. First let vs see what the decree was / and then it will ap∣peare how litle yt serueth Maister Giffard his purpose: these be the wordes. Act. 15.28.29. It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to vs, to lay no more burden vpon you then that which is necessary of these thinges, to absteyne from Idolothytes, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication; from which keeping your selues, yee doe well.
For one of these / which is (fornication) we haue here no question / it being by the moral lawe alwayes forbiden: For the other Maister Giffard would thus reason. The Apostles themselves did decree them for the tyme / therfore the Church hath power to make and ordeyne la∣wes in things of themselues indifferent / about the worship of God and publick exercises. For our answere / wee would haue Maister Giffard first learne / that he / in saying the Apostles themselves did this by the direction of the holy Ghost / hath ouerthrowen himselfe / for these were the Maister builders / apointed of God to be law makers for the whole Leitourgie and worship of Christ to all posterities / euen all the la∣wes and ordinances of the newe Testament / confirmed by miracles from heauen / deliuered by their ministery vnto vs: It will not follow then / if the APOSTLES had made and ordeyned some lawe here / that therefore euerie Synoode or anie Synode may impose lawes and commandements by themselves ordeyned / till they shew they haue that power giuen them the Apostles had / and an other Leitourgie to be made / which they shall neuer de able to doe / without a newe CHRIST: Wee haue a sure foundation alreadie laid / wherevpon all Synods and Counsells must build / and suffer their actions to be tryed therby / they haue not power to inioyne one title / which is not by the word of GOD inioyned vs. Further / what did the Apostles here that they had not warrant for: neither would they lay anie yoke or burthen. And as for these thinges / they doe as much binde vs nowe if ther be like cause / namelie / not in Idolothyts / blood / or that which is strangled to offend our weak brethren / if the Iues should be now agai∣ne called / neither to offend anie in meate or drinke for whome Christ hath dyed: Neither was ther here any absolute law made of these thinges / nor necessitye for the present tyme / furder then it should bee necessary for the respect set downe / for otherwise it had bene to build againe the thinges destroied / onlye they thus counselled and admonis∣hed the Gentiles to vse their libertye in these thinges / as they might gyve noe offence to theyr weake brethren of the Iues / the more to dra∣we them on in the wayes of CHRIST: for they doe not inioyne yt as a lawe / but tell them they shall doe well if they obserue these thin∣ges / by no necessitye inforced. But wee doe not nowe observe these thinges / the occasions being remoued. True / therfore I trust you will grant / that no man shall bee furder bounde to anye constitution in such thinges indifferent / then there shall bee cause / neyther need wee publicke order to retract: so that you leaue the matter to me / that wee can bee no further bounde in such thinges / then by those rules of edifijng / order / comlines / occasion shall require / so that wee neither need nor can haue setled lawes herein: howe much more bondage and bur∣den is imposed vnder this Antichristian yoke / the thinges being of themselves most lothsome and detestable Popery / abrogating and ma∣king voide all the true ordinances lawes and worship of CHRIST /
and so inforced as whot persecution procedeth against anie that of con∣science absteyne from them let it bee considered. Neither hath there euer bene detracting this thirtye yeares of anye your abhominations / neither is held lawefull for them that seeth them vnlawfull / to forbeare them / without deadlye hate / to bee followed to the death. Blessed bee our GOD / that hath deliuered our soules out of such Egiptian ser∣uitude / our liues are not deare vnto vs / neither shall your reproch moue vs. Nowe concerning the last places of the Treatise / where hee is vtter∣lye mute in this / that all whiche stand vnder another Hierarchie or spi∣rituall Regiment then CHRISTS / bee by outward profession no true Christians / or vnder the promise of salvation / also for the free∣dome wee professe in holye obedience to all statutes and ordinances off GOD / as hee hath left vntouched the matter / for which hee aled∣ged the 7. to the Romanes / namelye / the outward professed bondage to a false Spirituall government / so I having before largely expres∣sed my minde in that poinct of doctrine / and in such as then were about these thinges opposed / referre anye that desire the truth herein / to pon¦der the reasons and proofes there set downe / not minding to repeate againe / or to bee set aworke in vnfolding his troublesome and con∣fuse cauills in abusing this place / or to make further replye / till I see more capeable conceypt in him of such principles of regeneration and sanctification / of freedome and bondage / yet for others direction / one cauil or two shalbe breifly set in veiwe. First where hee supposing I had bene in error (and he himself fast fettered in heresie and seeth it not) chargeth mee to runne as farre on the other side / as a wheele turned with contrarye motions of the strea¦me / for saying I helde the deare children of GOD might fall into any sinne / except the sinne against the holye GHOST / yet bee re∣stored by repentance / GODS grace so far abounding / alwayes considered (as then I noted) that obstinacye in anye sinne / make them to vs the servants of sinne whiles they so remayned / not speaking this to giue leaue or incouragement to presume in the least or first step of sinne / lest GOD leaue them to themselves / but to giue them ho∣pe if they returne that haue so fallen: hee excepteth generally against all presumptuous sinne / saying / of frailty Gods childrē may fall / but of presumption hee maketh great doubt / for anye so sinning to bee renued by repentance / for it is spokē of the Maranatha to bee pronounced in this life to none / but that bee in that sinne against the holye Ghost: and here to fill his paper (as his common shift is / when hee can nei∣ther affirme nor denye) hee putteth me to newe questions: You must (saith hee) declare howe filthye incest is / not sinne against the holye GHOST / nor if a man kill his Father or Mother or children / nor witchcraft / nor familiarity with Spirits / is not your meaning that the regenerate man may of presumption and obstinacy commit
these? If Maister Giffard shoulde thus vnderstande the worde may hee is in the same fault to say the regenerate may sinne of frailty: And I answere furder / hee coulde vnderstand the worde may otherwise / if (as in all his writinges) hee caryed not this minde to take all in euil part / to quarrell / hee coulde have vnderstood it thus: that God suffereth of his elect to fall into such sinne / yet hee is able to reduce them by repentance / and hath made promise to receive them iff they retourne / and not haue cauilled in this maner in such thinges / the horrour in the verye naming of which sinnes shaketh the flesh and bo∣nes of the godlye to heare or behold: so that his drift is but to cast in a litle wormewood / to deface the truth deliuered: Therefore I will onlye prooue the generall doctrine before affirmed / and for these perticulars / let him that taketh pleasure in raking in them / being sinnes not once to bee named amongst GODS children / answere himself. And much better might hee have put his question thus. Whi∣ther wilfullye committing of sacriledge / and presumptuous continu∣ing to enchant in a false ministery / with Iannes and Iambres resistinge the truth / persecutinge the light against their knowledge / bee not wi∣thin the compasse of that sinne against the holye Ghost. That GODS elect after regeneration doe fall into presump∣tuous sinne / and for a time persist in obstinate sinne / and may bee re∣stored by repentance / I thus prooue: Manie of GODS children may bee excommunicat / and vpon the repentance bee receiued agai∣ne / as the incestuous person 1. Cor. 5. therefore do for a time remayne in obstinate sinne. Againe euerie sinne is to bee prayed for / but that one sinne against the holye Ghost 1. Iohn. 5.16. Therfore presumptuous sinne is committed of GODS elect after regeneration. That all presumptuous sinne is not sinne against the holy GHOST / wee shall see by the discription of that sinne Hebr. 6. and 10. where there is dispy∣ting of the Spirit / accompting the blood of IESUS an vnholy thinge / persecuting the light they haue sometimes tasted of / and such like notes / which are degrees. further then presumption: for the∣re is presumption of ignorance / of rashnes / of hope of mercy / and many times do the Prophets charge the people with rebellion against GOD: so that all presumption cannot have the curse maranatha pronounced vpon it / or the persons not to bee prayed for. But sure I grant / that presumption is neere to that sinne / and there cannot bee that high sinue without presumption. But now if all sinne but sinne of frayltie were vnpardonable / your Clergie were in a wo∣full case / that thus maynely resist the truth / and persecute GODS servants. Neither is this doctrine anye way contrarie to that I delyvered /
namelye / that the regenerat man cannot bee said to stande in bon∣dage to sinne after regeneration / and the servant of GOD at the same time by outwarde profession / for none are in bondage to sin∣ne after their calling to the faith / (to our iudgment) but suche as contynue obstinate in their open knowne sinne after due admoniti∣on: that such stande not by outwarde profession the servants off CHRIST but of sinne / and are to bee excommunicate / hee wil∣lingly granteth: and herevpon merueileth how I shoulde gather / that obstinat grosse sinners shoulde not bee excommunicat: which hee might playnlye perceiue if hee had eyes / for if al the regenerat bee in bondage to sinne / and so the servants of sinne and of Sathan / howe should they cast out an other for bondage out of their fellowship by the power of CHRIST? If Maister Giffard say / becau∣se the obstinate is in greater bondage then the other / this proueth not that the bond can cast out the bond by the power of Christ. Againe / if all bee in bondage / then none can bee houlden without for being in bondage to sinne: so that none shoulde be excommuni∣cat / none without / the worlde and the CHURCH / light and darknes / CHRIST and BELIALL should bee mingled together. To all which hee hath made no answere / but demandeth certeine questions / and maketh such a formall conclusion / as if all were in bondage vnto sinne. His questions I grant all affirmantiuely / yet denye his consequence. Let him plainely proue therfore by euidence of SCRIPTURE / that all that do sinne are bondslaues of sinne / and when hee hath so done / I shall therevpon conclude him a flat Anabaptist in the cheif ground of their profession. Verye gladlye therefore woulde hee leave out the worde (bondage) / and falslye accu∣seth and sclandereth mee / in saying I holde that men can not out∣wardly appeare sinners / and stand the servants of CHRIST both at a time / which is an open vntruth: Yt is hee / that cannot put difference betwene sinning / and bondage vnto sinne / so that in one worde all his questions are answered: If anie bee in bondage to sinne / hee standeth a seruant thereof. Now for the 7. to the Romanes / the APOSTLE setting forth the strift betwene the flesh and the Spirit / speaketh somtimes in the person of the one (if I may so speake) and somtimes of the o∣ther / somtimes of the newe man or regenerat part / or of himself so far as hee is regenerat: somtimes of the olde man / which is not wholly slayne / but ful of rebellion striueth for maisterie. Nowe I must demand of him / whether of these two haue the preheminen∣ce / dominion and rule in the regenerat / the graces of the Spirit / or the rebellions of the flesh? The same APOSTLE saith the SPIRIT / and that part off the man renewed there with /
which wee call the inner man: In the 8. Cap. he maketh it playne / The lawe of the spirit of life in CHRIST hath freed mee from the lawe of sinne and of death. What is the lawe of the Spirit but the powre / ru∣le / and dominion of the Spirit of GOD in vs? And what is the la∣we of sinne / but the powre of sinne / and bondage / wherewith wee were somtimes led headlong by Sathan at his pleasure / but are nowe freed / that it no more doth reigne or beare rule in vs vnto condemna∣tion. Againe / whosoeuer are ledd by the Spirit of GOD / are the sonnes of God / and in the 7. Cap. 4. and 6. Cap. 16. Knowe you not that to whome you exhibit your selves servants vnto obedience, his servants you are to whome you giue your selves obedient? David feeling the gre∣at assaultes of sinne in his flesh / and his inhabilitie to keepe the Lawe of GOD / earnestlye prayeth vnto the Lorde Direct my steppes in thy worde (saith hee) and let none iniquitie haue dominion, over mee. Af∣ter the stronge man is cast out / CHRIST beareth the rule over vs and in vs / by his Spirit. So the scripture euerye where pronoun∣ceth vs Saincts by calling / Kinges / and Priestes / a people set free / not that wee sinne not in thought word and deede howrely and daylie / but that sinne hath not dominion ouer vs: If then wee were in bondage to sinne / wee are the servantes of sinne and of death / which GOD forbid. Where Maister Giffard therfore reasoneth thus: the regenera∣tion is imperfect / therefore the freedome is imperfect / therefore there is some bondage / yt is blasphemie: For first our freedome is perfect in CHRIST / ells his death is not sufficient. Then though our sanctification bee not perfect / yet is there no bondage / but a rebellion of sinne: which if yt shoulde reigne / wee were not the servantes of CHRIST: And while it seemeth for a time to reigne / and wee obstinatly to cleaue vnto yt / wee are iudged (soe far as men can iudge) the servantes of yt / and so gyuen ouer from / CHRIST vnto Satan / till the grace of the Spirit againe to our iudgement appeare to beare rule. As for David in the whole yeare after hee had commytted adulterye and murther / hee never pleaded for his sinne when hee was reproued not did no longer cleaue vnto yt. Soe likewise though wee fall and sinne / and bee ledd awaye with sinne / yet are wee not in bondage there∣vnto / vntil wee obstinatly and wilfully give our selues vnto yt from CHRIST / which you finde not in the 7. to the Roman. but re∣sisting of sinne / a hatred of sinne / a will to doe good / a repen∣tance and contynuall recouerye of himself / and flying vnto Christ. Soe that your doctrine is false / to saye / the Apostle stoode in some spirituall bondage / and my Argument still firme / that these Ministers and people which stande in a professed bondage to a false governmēt / their praiers
are an abhomination vnto the Lorde / till they repent and submit them∣selues vnto CHRIST and his lawes and ordinances. Whiche the Lorde gyue them grace to doe / euen speedely to depart out of the house of bondage / and from all subiection of his Antichristian Hierarchie. Christs vnvvorthie vvitnes for the truth of his Gospell IOHN GREENVVOOD. FINIS.
