The High-way to Peace: Or, A DIRECTION set forth for the composing of those unhappy differences betwixt King, Par∣liament, Army, City, and Kingdomes: Shewing the sad effects these distractions have brought upon the whole Island. Published for the honour and love he beares to his native Countrey, By Sir EDVVARD PEYTON, Knight and Baronet. Patiar potior. Printed in the Yeere 1647.
The High-way to Peace: AStonished with the present condition of the times, when all mens pens write (unpu∣nished) what they please, without seri∣ous contemplation of conveniency; af∣ter much amazement, I recollected my thoughts, and esteemed it a duty to adde this drop to the Ocean of what hath beene printed, with praiers first to the highest, to direct me to write a word or two, to induce an universall peace in this peece of ground, which hath no limits but sea, heartily wishing I were a wise Esculapius to expresse apples of gold, and pictures of silver; if it prove an antidote to cure the violent di∣stempers, I shall be exceedingly glad, and if I labour in vaine, I have discharged my conscience, though with much sorrow. The Phisition can judge better of a Patient, by expe∣rience in others; as a distempered man is more sensible of folly, by seeing Bedlam; therefore I set before your eyes as in a glasse to behold the pest ilent disease of great Bittaine, what mortall cause was in the example, may be avoided in this Climate. While some make the whole body desperate by clan∣destine plots▪ and pamphlets unrecoverable, on purpose to make Parliamentary Authority despicable, that no phi∣sick can helpe the distemper; others as ambitious Solons, new modell the State, or imitate the burner of a goodly
Ephesian Temple to be famous in after stories, much like Quacksalvers, heale an ulcer by a sword thrust through the bowells, which may kill the body, and not cure the Tumor; and therefore in the serious view of present af∣faires, this age resembles the Romane Senate, tyred with civill mutinies, groaning with burdens of severall Ar∣mies, and new impositions, and torne in pieces by envy of subdivided factions, by which weakened in authority, fell weary of the intolerable waight, let the government by a strange dotage into the power of the boundles ambi∣tion of Iulius Caesar, who subdued the Senatorian great∣nesse, by singling out particulars, whom joyned hee could not prejudice. For this Parliament (the best of all since the conquest) had power and opportunity to free the Nation from sla∣very; a sicknesse almost incurable, had not the physick of a just defensive warre procured an incredible successe. The first they did in the edifice, was to deface Hyerar∣chy, afore they could cleanse the Church from rubbish, and drosse, sullied in time of Popery, waying severall formes in the balance of the Sanctuary, fix't upon Pres∣bytery; but finding a great distast from the severity in the peoples pallet, mixt with the vinegar, sweet milke, to abate the sharpnesse, and mittigate popular discontent, with appeale from the Clergy to lay men more pleasing, then the reformed Churches of Europe used: Behold though there was analay, and their stomakes puked, and could not digest alteration of Bishops, notwithstanding Presbytery seemed Apostolicall, because the words (without worldly pomp) and Presbyter are Sunonymaes: So that a new tropicke is turned, and the time is come, all Mountaines to be abased, and obstacles taken a way; for
the conquerour of hearts assailes all our Parliamentary power to let into Great Brittaine a new light and sunshine against all humane power, for supposing one as lawfull as the other. All this effected the high Counsell lanching the ship of the Sae over many Parliamentary tempests, and various Rockes, God seemed to be displeased in the very frontis∣peece of that Fabrick, with the Presbyterian pride, and insolent austerity of the Elders to their Superiors. For the great Lord of the universe raised some Syra∣phycall spirits to make a new discovery for ordering the Communion of Saints more agreeable to the word, then usually knowne in the world; a controversie I will not now discusse, the scope of my discourse tending another way; namely to desire a setled peace, and to shew the great danger wee run for reviving a new warre by Sali∣mandrine spirits, opposing each other without a mild dis∣pute, and pleasing converse: For the people lissening to the Pastors violence of spirit, are set on fire to quarrell with all that hold the contrary, who from scolding fall to blowes, from buffets to swords and gunnes, by parties si∣ding against parties, having a just ground, conceived to fall out about the breach of protestation, and brotherly, Covenant: they are ingaged to the Scotch Nation, whom I heartely wish may have good satisfaction by making manifest, that the order to be used by the Ministers, ap∣proacheth neerer the holy Scripture then theirs, and dif∣fers only in forme, not essence; so the binds of amity may be kept in unity of spirit; though divided in judge∣ment and opinion, to the end the protestation, and Co∣venant made in the presence of the Almighty, rise not in judgement against us, to make us guilty of the crime of
Laodislaus the Emperour, falsifying his faith with the Turke; who was slaine in the battle and place where the agreement was solemnly taken, and broken; whilst some are for Apollo, and others for Caephas, yet both for Christ; the Scots pertake with some faction heere, to cause En∣gland swim in blood, and hinder the building of Gods house, or be a Rrinora to the glory and felicity of the visi∣ble Church in the Martyrdome of many thousands. I feare therefore lest this great contestation betweene Independent and Presbyter cause a fatall Tragedy, as happened to the Clergy and Laiety about celebration of Easter such heart burning, and great persecution; for that, as a branch growing from that tree of division, sprang up the most horrible Arrian Heresie, which troubled the Church many yeares, till God raised a Counsell, dispel∣led the Aegyptian darknesse by distinguishing the words,  from, , which appeased the irreconcileable difference projected of two letters by Sathan, to make a schisme, and our Saviours death for salvation invallid: so I trust God will raise Evangelicall spirits to bring that glorious woman out of the Wildernesse (prophesied of in the Revelation) who may be Midwives to deliver her of the most ardent truth, to cure our frensicall part, that the fulnesse of the Gentiles may more speedily ensue, and consequently the remnant of the Jewes be gathered. And certainely the Divell hath stirred up our heresies on purpose to breake the neck of Parliaments by the in∣stigation of divers forraigne Jesuits come over, who adde fewell to our flame, either by Sermons or Counsells, and consequently will indanger the Parliament, as did the Ar∣minian in Holland. Surely wee are in the same danger the States of Hol∣land
were, when Philip the second of Spaine acknowled∣ged them a free State; so as soone as it had life by the vigilancy of Grave Maurice (a brave and wise Souldier) the miracle was, it had not buriall by the Artifices, and faction of Barnevelt, the chiefe of which he cut off with great celerity, and so dispersed the rable who intended their ruine. The Parliament after a long and dangerous voyage, brought to a good passe by the warre ended, there arose a difficulty to disperse and dispose the Army, long diverted from sending supplies into Ireland, by home-bred trou∣bles, because they had not paid the Souldier, who were unwilling to disband without their arreares: A wonder an Army so glorious (in the opinion of all) should be dis∣missed without salory: in consideration wherof the hou∣ses very well resented their worth and valour; yet found they wanted ready monies, and therefore were forced to solicite the City (where they might command) to issue money on good security to reward the Souldiery; but their answer was, they would not till they were cashered, for some in London were contrary in faction to the armed forces, and the Army to the City, affirming (as it was just) in plaine words they would not lay downe their weapons till they received their pay in part, and security for the rest, fearing to be served as the reduced Officers, for a time without money, meat, and cloathes. So that there was a double Set to be played, one to get moneys, and another to disband; a discontented victorious Army, denyed the one, and disappointed of the other; the Parliament was put to their trumps, and forced to play the game another way. By this time the great Counsell saw it impossible at
one and the same time to satisfie the Souldier, and please the City, because some few discontented persons (that well ordered City is not without) growing imaged a∣gainst the supreame Judges, sent a number of unruly Prentices to force their unjust demands (a president with∣out patterne, and violence never heard of) this caused both the houses to have their own guards, and not the Cities, of purpose to secure their persons, debate freely, prevent future molestation, and remedy repining mis∣chiefes likely to invade the peace of the State. By this it may appeare plainely the hindrance of our prosperity lies in the plots of malecontents, not in the Parliament nor Army the desie of the one is to send, and the willingnesse of the other speedily to be sent away, and not like a vulture to eate out the bowells of the Coun∣trey by free quarter, a charge only for the peoples just defence against forraigne or domestick foes which might invade or disturbe their quiet. Yet at the present there wanted not pestilent spirits would set a bone twixt Parliament and Army, and twixt both and Scotland; though our wise Senate labour with might and maine to settle a common peace heere, and in both Nations, as his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairefax, and Counsell of Warre indeavour to bring the Souldier to obedience, and give content to the Scot. Whereupon the Souldier guarded the Parliament, and secured the Tower, that no tumults molest the Parlia∣men, nor infest the City. By this time the wisdome of the great Counsell hath retrived (by wofull experience) the haunt of those who slight their endeavours (though with much expence, toyl∣some labour of body, and danger of person) they conti∣nue,
then continue to bring to passe the happy condition of Church and State, when others seeke more their owne ends, then Gods glory, and good of the Kingdome. For such people it is impossible to please; for where inconstancy possesseth the heart (a long travell to bring felicity to perfection) is most irksome, never considering affaires of so great consequence cannot be effected, but with long labour, and much reluctancy. So that the people jealous of a new warre, raised on the basis of their late payments are stirred up with an ear∣nest desire to be rocked in two cradles, affected most to wit, ase with rest and peace, knowing full well warre brings a consumption to a Kingdome how rich soever; e∣specially the wise seeing some Countries without corne, others without stock, some without Tennants, others with∣out money, some without Cattle, others burthened with free quarter, all concommitants of Civill Warre, which makes all long (like a woman with child) to be brought a bed of a well grounded peace; hoping as in that last sea∣ven yeares of our Henry the third, what mischiefe, and dissolation warre had caused in almost thiry yeares ill government, was repaired by aprentiship of yeeres, for which he was called the Justinian of his time. So now if the storme were past, and seaven yeeres ne∣ver so unfortunate, the Common weale may become in a short space fat and faire: So that nothing can be more cordiall then to have no Army at all; for the people feare that power may become dangerous, when Land and Sea are invested in the person of one, that what is given to a servant, may be usurped as an absolute Master; as Hen∣ry the 7 made the right of his Queene his owne, and so buried her title; not knowing where Religion is plac'st
in the heart, there can be no treachery in the action, and what is lent for a time will be restored to the proprietor. Therefore I beseech all to consider, the cause of our danger is the wrath of God which hanges over our heads (as a dismall cloud) ready to discharge upon us for many horrid opinions, and blasphemies; as swearing, propha∣nation of Sabbaths, drunkennesse, fornication, adultery, will-worship, formality, hatred, malice and liberty to do what pleaseth sence, though never so contrary to the eter∣nall Law, the least of which are heavy enough to pull downe the greatest judgement, namely sin punished in committing of sin; O that wee could (with Ieremy) shed a fountaine of teares! Certainely it is not the malignity of the ayre causeth the Plague, plotting and humane device, warre, combi∣ning of the Grasier and Farmer, scarcity, but our grie∣vous sins, and want of love bring upon us these evills; wherefore let us leave our transgressions, and be charita∣ble one to the other; for hatred bringeth division, di∣straction, mutinies, opposition, and armed forces; let us have care especially of tender consciences, which will be sooner convinced by sweetnesse then severity; let not Presbyter hate Independent, Independent Presbyter, Protestant Papist, Papist Protestant, Brownist Anabap∣tist, nor Anabaptist Brownist; but let all reason together▪ with mildnesse, the best still to confute errour, and fittest meanes to worke out truth, as the steele gently strikes out of the flint, fire falling upon tinder of good desires, kin∣dles the match of pious affections, and so lights the can∣dle of knowledge to shew the beaten way God hath ap∣pointed to walke in, if not a new yet a brighter way: so shall the noone day of understanding be cleared, and no
twilight of errour and mistake. Fot swavity causeth Iaphet to dwell in the Tents of Sem, fulfilling the divine Prophesie of these latter times, 11 Esay. 6 78 9.10.11. The Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, the Leopard lye downe with the Kid, and the Lyon, and the Fatling together, and they shall not hurt nor destroy, saith God, in all my holy Mountaine: this plainely insinuateth that all severity and harshnesse should be banished from Gods people, and love in sweetnesse be towards one another, for the Wolfe, Leopard, and Lyon are cruell beasts of pray, which devoure the Lambe, Kid, and Fatling are innocent creatures; so that if the cruell, and innocent shall agree in all Gods Mountainer, by which is meant his Church: Then tender consciences ought not to be forced, nor private duties in Families prohibi∣ted, that God may blesse this State, that piety may a∣bound, and Parliament and City not oppose each other; for severity causeth distractions, where Magistrares have no power, nor Nobility and Gentry respect, holding all things in common: And if severity of Presbyters rage over weake consciences, they may usurpe the tempe∣rall power over persons, estates, and purses, and become as Antichristian as the Popes of Rome, and worse then our late Bishops; for when the Clergy rules over the consciences of people, temperall power may out face, ne∣ver governe, and so by insensible degrees become hum∣blers of States, a course contrary to Apostolicall Doctrine which prohibits to Lord over Gods heritage when no man can know the conscience but a Diety, no more then the heart unlesse they had the infalibility of the spirit; so by this they trod the beaten path of the Romane Church when the Popes raised the mount of Supremacy over
Kings, and Potentates, a pride would not be pulled down, though assaied by many Emperors and Princes. If Parliament and Army are at a distance, the one hath no power to command, nor the other will to obey. When the Parliament is against the City, the Cities Charter may be questioned, Monopolies and Impositi∣ons will be on Marchandize, and manufactures to over∣throw Merchants and tradsemen, and the Parliament shall not have the Citizens purses at their command with their will and ability as they ought; for if the Physitian and Patient should fall together by the eares, the Physick may be as well poyson as holesome, for the high Senate pur∣geth Monopolies, and vomits up Impositions that trade and marchandize may flourish. The City and Countrey bring branches from the tree of one roote, ought to accord as loving brothers, and are then happy; but if they fall at variance, and disturbe each others pretious peace, what a world of mischiefe will insue? Besides bloodshed; how can the City vent their forraine commodities? When the Countrey may live of their homebread; or how can the Countrey sell their broad cloathes, stuffes, fustians, cheese, wheate, malt, or cattle, with divers others (too long) to recite? If City and Army stand at a distance, and oppose each other, the one may starve the other, stopping provisions by Land and Water, nor the Army have pay, but from the Magazin of the City to maintaine their forces. Lastly if England and Scotland have a warre, they will never be reconciled, but become goades in one ano∣ther sides, revive deadly fewd, and (which is worse for us) Scotland will batch a portall to let in forraine ene∣mies, as French, Dutch, Spaniard, and Dane, to cause
the seate of the warre to be heere, more advantagious to the invader, then the invaded; and more over meete heere with a strong Presbyterian Party to assist them, made an∣gry and revengefull against others by Pulpits. On the contrary side, the Scots shall finde us hardy, resolute, valiant, and incounter with an invincible Army, whom God hath blessed, and I hope will: and certaine∣ly I doe not see what colour the Scots have to invade us covenanting solemnly to assist us; for when they side with a party, they will ruine themselves to destroy us; for they shall adde fewell to make a flame, when they should quench the fire. They cannot come on our English ground, till our Parliament vote them; or if they shall invade us without our consent, they are to be reputed enemies, violators of peace, plunderers of our Countrey, to inrich themselves by our poverty; let them know, their intrusion without command of Parliament revives the noble tenure of Escu∣age, which many of the Kingdome hold by, to serve a∣gainst them with horse and foote, till they be beaten out, the number of those who hold by that service (by ancient survey) have beene computed forty thousand horse and foote, and if such Tennants shall refuse they forfeit their estates. Doe they conceive King Charles will protect a Nati∣on that sold him? Or those that prised him more then gold? Moreover every wise man will rather joyne with rich then with poore, his Majesties revennues being year∣ly a Million heere, not there a hundred thousand pounds. I have spoke this because they threaten us with Declara∣tions; yet I honour the Nation, and desire they may have satisfaction to a tittle; but if they shall persist, and
nothing shall satisfie them but blood, they will lose their arreares, get nothing but blowes, and set up their rest u∣pon one battle (out of their power to raise another;) nor doe I see what safe retreats they have, but what is gotten by blood, and so make the addage true, they come for nought but our goods, not to right our wrongs, but to fight with us, not to settle religion, but for lucre and gaine. O foolish England, will yee nourish serpents in your bosomes, ambitious to be Lords of your estates? Will you ayde and assist those that will ruine your Kingdome? And will you become traytors to your owne Countrey? I assure you the Law of England will make you so; this I have spoken rather to deter their illegall invasion, then provoke them: for the force of all my minde shall carry it selfe to perswade brothers to agree in unity, and to assist one anoher wih hearts, lives, and fortunes in a just and pious war desired of both; for I honour the Nation, and should be grieved, people of one Island should be cut in two pieces, brothers in Christ should become mortall enemies, who (joyntly) are able to vanquish France, or Spaine. I humbly beseech God to reconcile us together; let the lamentable example of us, and Ireland be before our eyes, a back doore to let in a forraigne enemy subjects of the same Soveraigne, though opposite in religion, as in their mindes, of whom it hath been said, that they were good servants; but when they got the key of power into their hands are bad Masters, governed by one, (indeede) no Law, witnesse the unnaturall bloodshed there, how can barbarous cruelty be revenged, as long as we have civill war? Moreover an Army divided cannot stand, therefore my humble suite to the Generall, Councell of war, Agi∣tators,
and Common Souldier is, to hold together, who joy∣ned are a sheafe of arrowes, but disjoyned may sheath their swords in one anothers bowells, or be vanquished; for then martial law will be of no force & validity; how often have the Romane Cohorts, and Turkish Jannisaries, chose new Empe∣rours, kild their Commanders, and Generalls, and at last they ruined one another? the sword is a good servant, but a bad Master. Or if the Souldier and Countrey jangle together, the Army will become odious, and none willing to harbour them, much lesse give free quarter. Likewise if the Parliament be divided (as a house) it can∣not stand, the Rights of Parliaments and Subjects will be de∣stroyed, and they utterly vanquished, as the Romane Senate by Caesar, then shall all wickednes go scotfree and unpunished. Certainely, Monarchy must not infringe the liberty of the people, nor people destroy Monarchy. For the composition of our government is partly Monar∣chiall, partly Aristocraticall, and will not admit of a dominion solely in the people, as it appeared plainly in the 15 yeare of Edw. 3. when they fell at variance in the choice of great Of∣ficers of State, they turned the course from the people into the royall channell; the Phylosophers stone may turne iron and brasse into gold and silver; but not gold and silver into baser mettalls, no more can the Soveraigne power be trans∣ferd on the people, nor the right of the people converted to the Soveraigne; for then Kings (without Law) may do what they list, have power of life at their pleasure; on the other side if power were in the ordinary sort there would be Anarchy, and totall confusion, therefore are the Lawes, that Kings may governe their Subjects with equity and justice, as the Subject obey the Soveraigne, and the King love and preserve the Sub∣jects lives and estates, by a legall way not fancy or pleasure: for the Lawes are Judges betwixt King and Subject, and Sub∣ject and Subject, otherwise the Kingdome will perish, rich tread downe the poore, widdow and fatherlesse will lose their right, people be oppressed? property utterly lost, and Religion will turne Atheisme.
The Common-wealth is a body (wherein are head and members) and King and Subjects, who ought to have a sym∣pathy and fellow feeling one of anothers wants, and commu∣nicate to each other all the good they can; all degres (as notes in musick) make a harmony of love, depend on, and sweetly relate to others; as the stars in the firmament of severall mag∣nitudes agree in quality and nature with the seven Planets, or as the heavens, where God is supreame, are Arch-angels, and Angels, ministringto each other. Wherefore my thrice humble suite is to King, Parliament, City, Coun∣trey, Army, and Scotland, to unite in love, and joyne together against for∣raine and domestick enemies of the State, that riches may merease, the King∣dome may be well governed, Religion flourish, and God be honoured, other∣wise we shall be like a great animall, as the Duke of Rohan saith, which doth nothing but destroy it selfe, when two so brave Kingdomes shall lay violent hands and murther one another. Especially my humble prayer to my native Countrey, is to live in amity a∣mongst themselves. A people have been the glory of Europe, conquerors of France, vanquishers of Palestina from the Saracens, defenders of the Pro∣testant Religion▪ who (I fay) have set the Crowne of France on the head of Hen. 4. at the expence of that Famous Queen Eliz. the glory of her sex) and by the prowesse of our brave Norrice, and the English Cavalry, opposed Spaine in all her glory, and at last brought her upon her knees, have been the greatest Antagonists of Rome, Protectors of the 15 Provinces, a safe sanctuary for the exiled Protestants, and inferior to no Countrey in valour. God give ths Counsell above a command; let us imbrace it, and love one another with due respect, duty to whom duty, and love to all, that future proofe may not turne discourses into a sanguine die, nor peace into bloudy war; so shall our swords be turned into plowshares, spades, and instru∣ments of husbandry, and right troden downe, shill be revived. And I humbly intreate you not to looke so much to errors past, as for∣wards; carry your selves like wise, and brave men, for feare while wee looke to punish others, we receive a blow shall take away power of punishment, and life it selfe: And when a calme comes you may locke upon Delin∣quents with a severe face of justice; and after every man may have distribu∣ted to him the dole of his due birthright; therefore let not the quarrelling Knave win a Catastrophe in our State, but the best of cards prevaile for or∣der, peace, and piety. Amen. Gloria Patri, Filio & Spiritui sancto, maximam pacem Ecclesiae & Republicae toto corde & animo opto. FINIS.
