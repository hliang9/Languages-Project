A Declaration of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, Relating to the Affairs and Proceedings between this Commonwealth and the States General of the United Provinces of the Low-Countries, and the present Differences occasioned on the States part. IF the Sufferings of the People of the United Provinces under the heavy yoke of their Oppressions, before their Deliverance from the same by the Mercy of God be remembred, and the Principles and Spirit which then acted in them, and the ready and constant Help which they have had in all times from this Nation, and that with no small Expence of English Blood and Treasure, the Returns which they have made towards this Commonwealth will hardly be believed. It is not intended to be very particular in mention∣ing the state of the Affairs of this Commonwealth as it stood when oppressed by a Tyrant, they were neces∣sitated to flie to Arms for Defence of their Lives and Estates, because in Parliament they did but assert and desire the Setling of their Just and Native Liberties, wherein by so many Wonders, in so many signal Bat∣tels, by such a Series of Providence in England, Ire∣land and Scotland, the Lord was pleased to bless a poor handful, who approved themselves faithful to that Cause.
Neither is that Endeavor to divide them in the me∣morable year of Forty eight, to be omitted; nor the great Preparations made against this Nation in the year One thousand six hundred and fifty, which necessitated their Proceedings in Scotland, being refused Satisfa∣ction for fore-past Wrongs; and denied Assurance of Peace from them, who had received the Declared Enemy of this Commonwealth from the United Pro∣vinces, where that mischievous Contrivement was hatched against England, and from whence their Ene∣mies had much open and secret Assistance by the Inte∣rest of the Prince of Orange and others, even at a time when that Prince and his Adherents were contriving, as was most probable, to erect a Tyranny upon those Countreys; and to reduce them to their former Bond∣age, of which he missed but narrowly, especially in his Attempt upon Amsterdam; which things are better known there then here, and are not the purpose of this Declaration. Neither is it pleasant to remember that cruel and bloody Business of Amboyna towards the English, for which no Satisfaction at all hath been given, though often demanded in that Case, and in others not un∣like it. But such was the Affection of this Nation towards the People of the United Provinces, and to the Esta∣blishment of Liberty, and the Advantages of Traffique and Strength to both; but above all, to the Advance∣ment of the True Protestant Religion which both pro∣fess, and which in humane probability would receive the greatest Growth by their Friendship; and obser∣ving in some of the Governors and People of those
Countreys an Affection to this Cause, and particularly expressed by them in their free Contribution for the poor Protestants in Ireland; that so soon as the Affairs here came by the Blessing of God to any consistency, the Parliament did send a Resident to the States Ge∣neral, who expresly refused to receive him, as them∣selves very well know. The Affairs here being yet further prospered by the Almighty, and the Affection and Judgement the same still in respect of their Neighbors, the Parliament sent again, and joyned with their Resident there another worthy Person Dr. Dorislaus, who were instructed and enabled to see if by any good means a right Under∣standing might be had; but one of these Publique Mi∣nisters, Dr. Doristaus, being come upon this publique Imployment to the Hague, the place of Residence of the States General; was there most barbarously and openly Murthered; of whose Assassination the world will judge as of an Action most abhorred, against all Rules of National Intercourse, and even Humanity it self; and how little was done there to Attache the Mur∣therers whilest the business was fresh, or hath been done since, though often called upon from hence, they well know, and must be here remembred. On the other side, the States having formerly sent their Ambassadors, the Lords, Borele, Renzwo and Joa∣kimi into England, in the time of the late Troubles, pretending all good Offices, which proved to be a Cor∣respondence with the Enemy, and a Means of Assisting them against those to whom they were sent; This, with Reproaches by them cast upon the Parliament, was the work of those Ambassadors; for which, how
lyable soever by the practice of Nations they left them∣selves, yet not the least Incivility was offered to them, but their Demeanor made known to their Superiors, and Repairation desired, but none vouchsafed. After these Passages, when it had pleased God to put a full End to the troublesom Affairs in England, not one Garison upon the firm Land being in the Enemies hands, nor any Force on foot, but all reduced to Peace and Settlement, the Affairs of Ireland in a good con∣dition, most of the Towns and Cities there in the Par∣liaments power, and their Affairs in Scotland not un∣prosperous, when there was much less cause to apply to the States, for any need the Parliament had of their Assistance, or if they should have looked upon them∣selves and their Neighbors, as other States use to do; yet still retaining the former Principles of Affection and Judgement of the great Concernment an Union between the two Commonwealths would be to the upholding of the Protestant Interest, so much designed upon by the Enemies thereof, and unto common good and Liberty. The Parliament did send a Solemn Embassy to the States General, the Ambassadors Enabled and Instru∣cted to endeavour to Compose former Differences, and to effect a firm and strict Union, as far as might be con∣sistent with Reason and Justice, and the Honor of this Nation, and be for Mutual good; Nay, they can say, That those Ambassadors from hence were Impowered to make such Tenders unto, and Agreement with the States, as would have demonstrated the Affection of this Commonwealth to the Good of the people of the Uni∣ted Provinces, the same as to themselves.
How unheartily and dilatorily they were dealt with in relation to their Errand, whereby the Embassy was rendred of no effect; how unsafe (to say no more) they were in their Persons during their aboad in the Nether∣lands, what Indignities were offered to them and their Followers, and unpunished; and at whose Door the fault hereof doth lie, is too apparent. But these En∣deavors for Friendship, by this delay and Aversness on the States part, becoming fruitless, the Honor of this Commonwealth in the Persons of their Ambassadors wounded, and their desires of Amity thus sleighted, the Ambassadors were recalled home. By this appears what hath been done to procure a firm League and Amity with the United Provinces, and what honest and sincere Endeavors have been on the Parliaments part to effect it, who in the mean time proceeding on to conflict with those Difficulties which Providence called them unto in Scotland and Ireland, and the same gracious hand of God which had gone along with them, having brought their Affairs in Ireland to so good a pass, as that little remained there to be done; and prospering the War in Scotland so, as that Countrey being in a maner quitted to them; and the Scotish Army under the Command of Charls Stuart, Son of the late King, marching into England, was to∣tally defeated at Worcester, and almost all of them kil∣led or taken, except himself and some few others hard∣ly escaping. Then and not before, the States General thought fit to send an Embassy to this Commonwealth, which was received with such willingness and Affection, as might testifie for them, they stood fixed to their for∣mer Principles.
As the Treaty went on, having some reason to avoid Dilatoriness and to desire Certainty, when Positive Demands were pressed to the States Ambassadors, they were evaded in things not of the hardest Resoluti∣on, with Allegations of want of Power, though their Commission shewed no such Restraint: yet to obtain further Power▪ Returns must be made to their Superi∣ors; and before Answers could be had, the Provincial States must be Assembled, which gave small grounds of any real intendment of a firm Peace and Amity. During the time of Treaty also, whilst at the first their Ambassadors Debates seemed to seek no better Props then of Ingenuity and Reason, the Ambassadors of the States acquainted the Parliament, that one hun∣dred and fifty Ships of War were intended to be set out by their Superiors, besides those of their Navy then abroad; and all these pretended for more security of the Sea; and conservation of the Trade and Navigation of the United Provinces, but not to offend England. Whether this were done to Amuse the Parliament or to Denounce against them, is to the States best known, and the Grounds of those extraordinary and great Preparations, when they had no Enemy at all in these Seas. To these things the Parliament made no other An∣swer, but quietly intended a Provision for their own just Defence, in case any should Invade them. Never∣theless, not altering their Resolutions more or less as to the things to be insisted upon or granted, having made Justice and Honor, and a mutual Good, in preser∣vation and saving of each Rights to other, the rule to steer their Actions by, who were most willing to come
to a happy Close of this Treaty, and were not, to their knowledges, wanting in any thing which might testifie their reality to finish the same. In the mean time the States go on with their Prepa∣rations at Sea, appoint their several Rendezvouz of their Fleet tending to a Conjunction of all into one, under the Command of him whom they call Lieu∣tenant Admiral Trump; what his Intentions or Instru∣ctions were, his own Deportment and some precedent Actions will demonstrate. Particularly, when amongst others, one of their Ships being met by a man of War under the Com∣mand of Captain Yong, was in a friendly maner sum∣moned to give the usual Respect to the Ships of War of this Nation, which another of his Company had done before, and which hath been accustomed not onely as a civility and respect, but a principal Testimo∣ny of the unquestionable Right of this Nation to the Dominion and Superiority of the adjacent Seas, ac∣knowledged generally by all the Neighbor-States and Princes, and particularly by themselves and their Pre∣decessors, besides many most authentique Records and other undeniable Proofs, together with a constant Pra∣ctice in Confirmation thereof: Yet he refused, affirm∣ing that if he did it, he should lose his Head. Not long after this ensued that Action of Trump, the particulars whereof are set down in the Narrative herewith Printed; by which that Hostile and injurious Act appears to have been done against Neighbors in Amity, who have so often and earnestly desired and testified their willingness to firm and continue the same: and this also vailed with, and in the midst
of a Treaty of Peace offered by themselves. Accompanied also with such Arrogancy & Injustice, not onely to the denying of so unquestionable a Right, but Usurping upon the same; and in prosecution of that Injury without any provocation, seeking out the Ships of this Commonwealth in their own Seas, upon their own Coast, in their own Road, there falling upon them, be∣ginning a War, and thus endeavoring the Destruction of their Men and Ships, even to the beating them out of the Sea, and utter Subversion of the Naval Power and Trade of this Commonwealth, had not God by his goodness turned the shame thereof upon the heads of those who were the wrong Doers. After this long Patience of the Commonwealth of England, and after these high Injuries and Provocations thus forced upon them, the Success at Sea not answer∣ing Expectation, it pleased the States General to send another Ambassador Extraordinary to the Parliament; who, as the former Ambassadors a little before his coming had done, laboured to excuse their Superiors from having any Intention, or giving any Instruction to Warrant this Dealing; which, notwithstanding the Preparations, the returning from another Course and seeking out the Parliaments Ships in their own Roads, and there falling upon them without the least Provoca∣tion, as before is mentioned, was yet by the Ambas∣sador called an Accident, and a thing done by meer Chance, the Action in the name of his Superiors utter∣ly disclaimed, yet the Imployment and the Agent con∣tinued by them and reinforced. And when the clear truth of this unworthy Fact, bearing in it self part of the Proof thereof, by the Fleet
under the Command of Trump, coming purposely in∣to the Road of England unto their Fleet; and the rest thereof being attested, not onely by many eye-wit nesses, Englishmen, but also by divers Officers, and others of the Netherlands taken in the Fight, who con∣cur fully in the Testimony; yet a long and intricate way of Examination thereof is propounded, a Cessa∣tion of acts of Offence and Hostility in the mean time desired, and a new Proceeding upon the old long Trea∣ty entred into by the former Ambassadors; that time being thus gained, an addition of strength might there∣with be provided. The Powers of this Ambassador being desired to be seen, none but his Credential Letters, and some Passes for his Transportation were produced; but no power to Treat and Conclude with the Parliament, for which material Point he resorted to the Powers of the for∣mer Ambassadors, who had Commission to Treat and conclude upon the former Negotiation, and owned this also; and although they came upon the general business of the Treaty of Alliance between the two Commonwealths, and the Lord Pauw came upon a par∣ticular Action done after that Treaty begun and pro∣ceeded in; yet such was the continued desire of the Par∣liament, if possible, to compose the said late Differen∣ces in a Friendly way, that they proceeded to treat with the Lord Pauw, waving the present Dispute upon his want of Powers. And when nothing in Particular was tendred by the Ambassador, but the Generals before recited; and a Proposal, That the Parliament would make their De∣mands to him; they were contented, not insisting upon
the disadvantage thereof, to make their Demands un∣to the Ambassador for Satisfaction for Wrongs past, and Security for the future, which are herewith likewise Printed; whereby it was put into the Hands of the Am∣bassador, to come to an Agreement upon the Demands of Satisfactions to be by both Parties moderated and asserted, as was propounded to him in another Paper; and upon such Agreement for Satisfaction (the Demand for Security being left to after consideration) to have a Cessation of all acts of Hostility and Offence as he de∣sired, and the Parliament was thus willing to assent unto. But instead of drawing towards any such Agreement, or endeavoring to come to Particulars therein as was offered; the Ambassador was not pleased at all to se∣cond or pursue his former earnest desire of a Cessation, though it were thus in his own Power to accomplish, but wholly declined the same; and for himself and the other Ambassadors, desired speedy Audience to take their leaves, and to depart into their own Countrey, being expresly commanded (as they affirmed) so to do; and in that they were not denyed any Respect or Ac∣commodation, nor used, during their abode here, as the Publique Ministers of this Commonwealth had been in the United Provinces; and by this Departure, they were pleased to put a period both to the one and the other Treaty. At their last Audience in Parliament, much was re∣cited of the same matter contained in their former Pa∣pers; and as to that which they then urged concerning acts of Hostility not looked for, neither at any time before declared; and that their Ships (brought into the
Ports of England, and there detained of late against their thought, and before any Declaration of Hosti∣lity issued out, and whereof the Commanders are un∣ware and guiltless, having not given the least, nor to no body occasion of Disputes) might be released; the Parliament therein need but refer to the Narrative by them published, and delivered to the Ambassadors of the Lords the States General, before the arrival of the Lord Pauw, and seen by him at his first coming. And although that first Breach and high injury done by Trump was on the Parliaments part altogether un∣deserved and unlooked for, yet after the same commit∣ted, a Prosecution against the Wrong-doers could not in probability but be looked for from the Parties inju∣red, to whom no Satisfaction hath yet been offered; unless the Parliament should quietly and tamely have laid themselves down at the feet of those who have thus endeavored the Ruine of them, and have betray∣ed into those hands the Rights and Safety of the Peo∣ple of this Nation, which few would have esteemed agreeable to the great Trust in them reposed. By these Proceedings faithfully represented to the view of the World, it will be more then evident with what Affection and Constancy the Parliament have la∣bored for the Friendship of the United Provinces: how carefully they avoided all Differences and Occasions of a War between the Nations, though all such Overtures of Amity and nearest Alliance have been rejected. At last, when this Commonwealth was assaulted and invaded, their Ships torn, their Men slain, without the least colour of any Offence given; upon which At∣tempts and the Consequences thereof had the same
succeeded, not onely the Rights, Honor and Traffique, but even the very Being of this Commonwealth had been highly endangered; The Parliament held it their Duty, thus compelled and necessitated into a most un∣welcome War begun upon them, to defend themselves; and whilest a just Satisfaction and Security cannot otherwise be had, To endeavor the gaining thereof by such ways and means wherewith the Lord shall enable them. And herein, as the Parliament doth rest abundantly comforted in the Integrity of their own Proceeding, and faithful Discharge of their Duty, so they as∣sure themselves that all indifferent persons will enter∣tain this clear Testimony of the Justness of their Cause; for the issue whereof they depend not upon any Policy or strength of Man, but onely upon the Goodness and Assistance of that Righteous God who hath hitherto in so wonderful a maner appeared for them, and who ne∣ver failed those that seek him, and with uprightness and sincerity of Heart attend upon him.

The Answer of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, to Three Papers presented to them by the Councel of State, from the Ambassadors Extraordinary of the Lords the States General of the United Provinces, upon occasion of the late Fight between the Fleets. THe Parliament of the Commonwealth of Eng∣land, calling to minde with what continued De∣monstrations of Friendship and sincere Affections, from the very beginning of their intestine Troubles they have proceeded towards their Neighbors of the United Provinces, omitting nothing on their part that might conduce to a good Correspondence with them, and to a growing up into a more near and strict Union then formerly, Do finde themselves much surprized with the unsutable Returns that have been made there∣unto, and especially at the Acts of Hostility lately committed in the very Roads of England upon the Fleet of this Commonwealth, the matter of Fact whereof stated in clear Proofs, is hereunto annexed; Upon serious and deliberate consideration of all, and of the several Papers delivered in by Your Excellen∣cies to the Councel of State, the Parliament thinks sit to give this Answer to those Papers: The Parliament, as they would be willing to make a charitable Construction of the Expressions used in the said Papers, endeavoring to represent the late Engage∣ment of the Fleets to have hapned without the know∣ledge, and against the minde of Your Superiors; So when they consider how disagreeable to that profes∣sion
the Resolutions and Actions of Your State and their Ministers at Sea have been, even in the midst of a Treaty offered by themselves, and managed here by Your Excellencies, the extraordinary Preparations of One hundred and Fifty sail of Men of War, without any visible occasion, but what doth now appear (a just ground of Jealousie in Your own judgements, when Your Lordships pretended to excuse it) and the Instru∣ctions themselves given by Your said Superiors to their Commanders at Sea, Do finde too much cause to be∣lieve, That the Lords the States General of the United Provinces have an Intention, by Force to usurp the known Rights of England in the Seas, to destroy the Fleets that are, under God, their Walls and Bulwarks, and thereby expose this Commonwealth to Invasion at their pleasure, as by this late Action they have attem∣pted to do: Whereupon the Parliament conceive they are obliged to Endeavor, with Gods assistance, as they shall have opportunity, To seek Repairation of the Wrongs already suffered, and Security that the like be not attempted for the future. Nevertheless, with this minde and desire, That all Differences betwixt the Nations may (if possibly) be peaceably and friendly composed, as God by his Pro∣vidence shall open a way thereunto, and Circumstances shall be conducing to render such Endeavors less dila∣tory, and more effectual then those of this kinde here∣tofore used have been.

A Narrative of the late Engagement between the English Fleet under the Command of General Blake, and the Holland Fleet under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral Trump near Dover. UPon Tuesday the Eighteenth of May 1652. in the morning, General Blake being gone to the West∣ward as far as Rye Bay eight days before with twelve or thirteen Ships, leaving Major Bourn in the Downs with eight Ships onely, there appeared upon the backside of the Goodwin a Holland Fleet of Men of War consisting of two and forty Ships, one whereof had a Flag on the main-top-Mast head, the rest Jacks and Ancients; and being come unto the South-sands head, two of them bore up towards the English Ships in the Downs, where∣upon Major Bourn sent out the Greyhound to examine them, and to know the reason of their so near approach; who answering, That they had a Message to the Com∣mander in chief in the Downs, were permitted to come in; and having saluted the Flag, the two Captains na∣med Tyson and Aldred came Aboard the said Major Bourn, and acquainted him that they were sent by Van Trump to let him know that he had been Riding about Dunkirk with his Fleet, where by reason of foul Wea∣ther they had lost many of their Cables and An∣chors, and the wind being Northerly, were driven fur∣ther
to the Southward then they intended, which Van Trump thought fit to signifie to prevent any misappre∣hensions or Jealousies. And having said this, and re∣ceived for answer, That the Reality of what they said would best appear by their speedy drawing off from this Coast, they departed to their Fleet; and immediately upon their arrival with them, the whole Fleet stood up to Dover, and came to an Anchor within little more then shot of the Castle the same day in the afternoon. Upon their coming before Dover Castle, and Riding there with Flag in the Main-top, without saluting the Castle, the Castle made three shot at them; notwith∣standing which, the Dutch Admiral kept up his Flag, and rode there at Anchor until the next day noon, and exercised his Musquetiers, by discharging Volleys of small shot many hours together. Upon Wednesday about twelve a clock the Dutch Fleet weighted Anchor and stood off towards Calice some four Leagues into the South-east; about the same time the English Fleet un∣der General Blake coming from the West towards the Downs discovered them, and supposed by their course they had been going back; Major Bourn likewise was in fight, coming from the Downs to joyn with General Blake: About an hour or two after, the Holland Fleet altered their course, came back again, made all the Sail they could, and bore directly with General Blake, Van Trump the headmost with his Flag in the Main-top; and being come within shot, the General shot a Gun at his Main-top, and then two single shot more: whereupon Trump shot a single shot through the Generals Flag and then immediately gave the first Broad-side and took in his Pendants, and hung out his Red Flag under
the Holland Colours, which was the signal on their part for the whole Fleet to ingage, and so the Fight began, which happened between four and five a clock in the af∣ternoon, and contiued until nine of the clock. In the Fight the English took two of the Holland Fleet, one whereof having six foot water in the Hold they left, ta∣king the Captain and Officers aboard, the other being a Ship of thirty Guns. General Blake lay all night where the Fight began, or near thereabouts, and the Holland Fleet was espyed about four Leagues distant towards the Coast of France next morning. The truth of this Relation appears in the Letters of General Blake, Major Bourn, and others in the Action, by the Examinations of the Dutch Captains, and other Officers taken in the Fight; the Instructions given to the Dutch Captains and Commanders, and other Pa∣pers, all which are hereunto annexed. And whereas Van Trump in the accompt he gives of this Action, makes the occasion of his coming back upon the English Fleet, the guarding of some Mer∣chant men richly laden from the Streights, which had been in fight with some of our Friggots: That action is set down in a Letter written by Captain Yong (here∣unto also annexed) whereby the occasion, beginning and ending thereof is declared. And besides, those very Ships which he pretends to come to protect or re∣scue, upon Saturday before had past by General Blake, and were gone to the Eastward.
A Collection of the Proceedings in the Treaty between the Lord Pauw, Ambassador Extraordinary from the States General of the Vnited Provinces, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England. The Lord Pauw's Speech at his Audience before the Parliament, the Eleventh of Iune, 1652. Right Honorable, THe Publique Testimonies and manifest Tokens of a sincere Benevolence, pure Love and true Friendship, which the Universal State and Sub∣jects of the United Provinces have always shewed to the English People, and principally to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, now prosperously and happily Governing, are so notorious and known to the whole Christian World, that no body can doubt of it; much less of a true Faith and long used Observation of Friendship, of the States General of the United Provinces. But, forasmuch as by reason of the Variety and In∣constancy of Worldly things, sometime happen those things which do dark the Exterior Face with Clouds, and are like to shew a Distraction of mindes: But when these things are prevented by time, and all Contrarieties taken away, they will serve more to conserve and con∣firm,
then to dissolve the Bonds of mutual Friendship: Therefore it hath pleased the States General of the United Provinces, my Superiors; notwithstanding they doubt not of the singular Wisdom and Diligence of their Extraordinary Ambassadors here, staying about great and weighty Business, to send me in an extraor∣dinary Embassage to the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of England, To present clearly and sincerely their Wishes for the Publique Safety and happy Go∣vernment thereof; with proffer of all their good Of∣fices, as I, being so lately come from their Honorable Assembly, can testifie out of my certain knowledge, That nothing is more in their Hearts and Wishes, Then that not onely a firm and constant Friendship be Reli∣giously kept between both States; but that it may daily grow, and by all means be consolidated, and no∣thing may happen which may break or any way disturb the Bars of mutual Safety, Profit and Friendship, be∣tween so Neighbor Nations: And that therefore they have received with great Astonishment and sorrow of Heart the News, of what, contrary to all expectation, hath lately happened between the Admirals of both Commonwealths. But forasmcch as this unlooked for and unexpected case might not onely raise new Trou∣bles, but also give occasion of Suspition, as if the present Treaty for a mutual Alliance, and a straighter Corroboration of the old Friendship, was not earnestly prosecuted, and therefore we should labor in vain to come to a happy end: My Superiors have not thought amiss, but rather convenient, even necessary, that at this time and upon this unhappy case fallen out, I should above the ordinary use and custom, and there∣fore
superabundantly, (seeing that by reason of my Office I have been in all their Counsels) represent open∣ly and sincerely to the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of England, all the Particulars which have happened, as well before as after that Fact, as they are come to their knowledge, to remove all things out of the way which might breed any grudge or breach of Friendship between both States, or cause the least di∣sturbance or delay to the Treaty. Therefore, by virtue of the Credential Letters of the said General States, and in their name I do Protest and Declare to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, That they have never entertained in their thoughts, never acted, much less commanded any thing which might offend the Dignity of this Com∣monwealth, lessen the common Friendship and good Correspondence which hath endured for so many years, or under any pretence whatsoever sow any seed of Misunderstanding; But rather that the said States have intended with all their hearts, and endeavoured by all their power, That the said Friendship and Alli∣ance might be perfected in the best way, and speedily, and might be solemnly established for ever for the Safety and Advantage of both Commonwealths. It is very true that a great Fleet hath been prepared in the Low Countreys, but that the States General have by the continual Complaints of their Subjects been forced to consent to it, is also a thing most certain and known; as also, that they have Ordered, That notice thereof should be given to the said Parliament; which was done and signified to no other intent, then that the Subjects of the United Provinces which had suffered great Da∣mages
at Sea, and lost several ships, should be secured and protected by just and ordinary means; and that no Wrong or Offence should be offered to any, much less to undertake any Dispute against the Fleet and Ships of the same Parliament upon the Controversies and Differences of the Sea. All which being done and per∣formed in that maner, and nevertheless being acciden∣tally hapened of both sides a great Debate and Con∣troversie between both Fleets, the States General have thought fit to acquaint the Parliament of Eng∣land, with the Relation sent to them in writing by their Admiral, and approved and witnessed by their Cap∣tains and other faithful persons, That the Admiral Trump, more by necessity then other reasons, is come nigh the Fleet of this Commonwealth, and hath first sent his civil Salutation to the Commander Bourn; and having afterwards met accidentally with the Ad∣miral Blake, put out his Boat to send some Deputies unto him, and to Declare the Reasons of his coming, and besides that, commanded to take down his Flag; but when he saw, that he against all expectation was unhappily saluted by him with a Broad-side, and there∣upon he discharged his Guns, not to offend but to de∣fend himself; and that from thence by meer accident, rather then purposely, was arised a Fight amongst those Fleets, which by the Lords Blessing shortly after was ended: Which, forasmuch as it was begun by an un∣expected Salutation, and not continued with earnest∣ness by ours, nor done or committed by Alienated mindes, or any Reasons known before, but by Chance; Therefore the States General do friendly desire, That the Parliament of the Commonwealth of
England will be pleased to believe and be perswaded, That nothing was done with a consulted purpose or foregoing Command, but meerly by a casual Chance, and perhaps by reason of the Fragility and Inconstance of the worldly things; and so much the more direct their Counsels and Commissions thither, That all Ob∣stacles, Offences, and further Wrongs may with all speed be removed out the way and prohibited, as the States General on their part are prompt and ready to apply convenient Remedies. They judge that it concerneth much the whole Christian world, and prin∣cipally the States of the Reformed Churches abroad, That those Misunderstandings do not grow greater be∣tween these Commonwealths, and that between Neighbors, partakers of the same Faith, should arise any Dissention which should disturb, interrupt the com∣mon and necessary Commerce, and give occasion, as well to their known as to their secret Enemies, to lay waits, or to draw into diverse parts those Common∣wealths ready to be United in a common Alliance; and by such means removing from themselves the seat of Calamities and War, to bring (which God forbid) it to their own destruction: To prevent so great a danger, and that the evil may not spread further, I am com∣manded by times to propound, and do all my best, That by convenient means there may be a speedy Com∣posure made of what is past; and that there may be Or∣der taken, That hereafter such unlucky and unhappy Cases happen no more between the Fleets of both Commonwealths, wherein they Desire, the Dignity and the Honor of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England may be conserved.
Whereas then the States General do herewith open∣ly Declare to the said Parliament, That they desire in∣tirely, That all offices of Friendship and Benevolence may be continued, the contrary may be prevented; and that the Councels of all sides may be directed to the desired end and conclusion of the mutual Confedera∣cy; therefore, I do earnestly intreat, That it may please the said Parliament to hear and understand me without any delay, by their Deputies or Counsel of State, and proceed without intermission in the just and amicable former Transactions, to bring the principal Business to an end and conclusion, as the Extraordinary Ambassadors of the States have Charge and are ready to do. In the same time I do return my Thanks for the singular Favor done to my Lord Neuwport, in granting him some days ago one of the Parliaments ships for his return into the Low Countreys; and the said Lord be∣ing a Member of the States of Holland and West-Friezland, I am charged to desire him to stay here, to communicate Counsels and return with me, which I hope will not be displeasing to the Parliament, to whose Benevolence I with all Respect recommend me and all my Offices.
A Translation of the Letters Credential to the Lord Pauw. The States General of the United Provinces of the Low-Countreys; WHereas We have found convenient, even very ne∣cessary, in the present Condition of the Affairs in Europe, to send to the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of England, the Lord Adrian Pauw Knight, Lord of Heemstede, Hogersmilde, Rietwijck and Nieu∣werkerk, Counsellor Pensionary of Holland and West-Friezland, and Ordinary Deputy in Our Assembly, from the said Province, as Our Extraordinary Ambas∣sador; having made election of his Person, as of one, of which, for his rare Qualities and long Experience, We make a high esteem, and have a great Confidence; being well acquainted with our good and sincere In∣tentions, which have no other Aime, then the Main∣taining, Increasing, Confirming and Strengthning more and more the good Amity, Correspondence and Alliance between both Nations and States, grounded upon common Interests of Religion, of State and Commerce; having such Confidence of his Ability, Prudence, Fidelity and Diligence, that we do refer Our selves to him to express them viva voce, to the said Parliament of the Commonwealth of England; and chiefly, the Zeal that We do continue to have for all what may concern the common Good and Security of both Nations: Wherefore We intreat with earnestness and with all Our Affection, the said Parliament of the
Commonwealth of England by these Presents, That they be pleased to give a favorable Audience to the said Our Extraordinary Ambassador, and to give him absolute Credence as to Our selves, in all that he shall say and propound of Our part in this present condition of the Affairs of both Commonwealths. Done at the Hague in Holland, the Fourteenth of June, One thou∣sand six hundred fifty two. To the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England. Friday the 11th of June, 1652. Mr. Speaker by way of Report, acquaints the Parlia∣ment with what was delivered by the Lord Pauw Ambassador Extraordinary from the Lords the States General of the United Provinces, at his Audience in the House this day, and presented the Paper delivered in by the said Lord Ambassador Extraordinary, and the Trans∣late thereof in English, which was this day read. Ordered by the Parliament, That these Papers be referred to the Councel of State; And that it be likewise referred to the said Councel, to hear what the said Lord Ambassador Extraordinary hath further to say, and to Treat with him; they holding close to the former An∣swers and Declarations the Parliament hath made, and report it to the Parliament with all speed. Hen: Scobell, Cleric. Parliamenti.
The Lord Pauw's Speech at his Audience in the Councel of State. Right Honorable, WHereas it hath pleased my Lords the States Ge∣neral of the United Provinces to send me, be∣sides their Extraordinary Ambassadors, in the same quality, to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England; and having yesterday had the Honor to De∣clare in their full Assembly the true subject of my coming, and the sincere Intentions of my Superiors: Therefore, I think it to be my duty to appear likewise before this Honorable Councel to present my Creden∣tial Letters, and wish your Honors all felicity and good success in the direction and managing of so great Af∣fairs as are to them committed by this great Common∣wealth. And as I have Declared unto the said Parlia∣ment, so do I likewise Declare again with truth and certain knowledge, That my Lords the States General have always had, and have at this present more then at any time before, a very great desire to maintain, in∣crease, and keep faithful the good Friendship, straight Alliance, and perfect Correspondence which hath so long endured between both Nations and States, where∣of there hath been heretofore many notorious and ma∣nifest testimonies: It is most constant, That my Su∣periors have nothing more in their hearts, then to see a finishing and conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance be∣tween both Commonwealths; to the end, That there∣by a straighter Union and brotherly Concord may be
established, to subvert and destroy all Plots and Divi∣sions which would trouble and much endanger the one and the other, as also make them less considerable to the Christian world. This is (my Lords) the very aim of the Enemies of the Reformed and Orthodox Reli∣gion, making a certain account, That they will be able by such a Disagreement and Division, not onely to weaken both States, but to bring them also to the ut∣most extremities. But both People being blessed by the Lord with that precious gift of the true Religion, and wonderfully provided, besides the Spiritual, with Temporal Benedictions, by the benefit of Navigation and Commerce in all parts of the World: and my Lords the States General, judging that the first ought necessarily to be conserved, and the other be looked to, the Religion maintained, and the State secured, did believe, That all those Inconveniences can be no bet∣ter prevented, then by joyning the Souls and Goods of both Commonwealths, and by this means make them able, with Gods assistance, to shun all Michinations to the contrary. Therefore, the unexpected news of the meeting of the two Fleets, and the Offences given of both sides hath brought no small Trouble amongst the General States, who have thereupon judged most ne∣cessary to dispatch extraordinarily and speedily to in∣form the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Eng∣land, and this Honorable Councel, and to perform such Endeavors, made choice of me that have been admit∣ted in both Assemblies of the States General and of those of Holland and West-Friezland, and acquainted with their most important and most secret Counsels and Deliberations, to witness here with most certain
knowledge of the matter, and no less truth and faith∣fulness, That no Deliberation was made, no Resolution taken, no Commission directly or indirectly given to displease in any ways the Commonwealth of England to offend them, and much less to set upon their Fleet or Ships; but that on the contrary, there was Com∣mand given to deal with them in all places as with the best Friends, and to shew them all kinde of Favor and Courtesie. And as in the said unhappy meeting things have been on both sides otherwise, and very un∣warily acted, whereof I made yesterday a large Relation, which I do not intend to mention again at this present, nor to revive that which ought to be buried and entire∣ly forgotten. Notwithstanding, having understood out of the last. Answer delivered to our Ambassadors, that there is a Satisfaction demanded for what is past, and Security for the future; And my Lords the States conceive it to be necessary, That all Mis-understanding and Mis-construction of what is lately passed in the said Encounter may be taken away, and both States secu∣red from the like Inconvenients hereafter; As also, that it be proceeded without delay in the continuating and perfecting the Treaty of Alliance so far advanced already: And moreover, That it be considered of the most convenient and reasonable Means which may re∣move the shadows of all Suspition and Mistrust; and that such Orders be made which the Fleets shall be bound to follow hereafter; to which purpose I have sufficient Instructions from my Superiors. I desire therefore that it may please Your Honors to commit some of the Members of this Honorable Counsel, with whom I may, as soon as is possible, begin, continue and
finish that which may serve to the Satisfaction of both States, and removing of all Differences: To which I must adde here, That my Superiors did never pre∣tend nor shall pretend to dispute the Honor and Dignity of this Commonwealth, which they repute the First and most considerable in Europe; and wish that by an Union of these two formidable States, they might secure them both, preserve them from the Conspi∣rations of their Enemies, and settle by a perfect In∣telligence and Confidence their common Peace and Safety. In the mean time I pray yours Honors, That it may please you by your wise direction, to order as speedily as is possible, that the evil may not by rea∣son of this unhappy accident proceed any further, by committing new Offences, Pursuits, or taking of Ships, but that all Attempts and such Actions may be inter∣dicted and stopped, and not by making the wound wider, even uncurable, to expose our selves to the will and pleasure of our Enemies; being confident, that we shall be able to finde convenient Remedies to remove friendly and happily the present Differences, to the Confusion of those who wish and expect it otherwise. I shall be exceedingly beholden to this Honorable Councel, if your Honors grant me a speedy Answer upon these, that I may without intermission begin so Worthy, Profitable and Necessary work; commend∣ing my self in the mean time with all Respects to your Honors Favor. Pronounced in the Councel of State of the Par∣liament of the Commonwealth of England, the 22/12 of June, 1652.

Ex: Jo: Thurloe, Clerk of the Councel.
Monday 14. June, 1652. At the Councel of State at White-Hall. Ordered, THat the Commissioners appointed to Treat with the Lord Pauw, Extraordinary Ambassador of the Uni∣ted Provinces, Do demand of the said Lord Ambassador, a sight of the Powers & Authorities given to him by his Su∣periors to treat and conclude upon such matters and things as he hath to offer; and acquaint him, That the Parliament Desires, That all speed and expedition may be used on his Excellencies part in this present Treaty desired by him∣self; assuring his Lordship, That nothing shall be want∣ing on the part of the Councel of State which may be any way conducing to bring the same to a speedy issue. Ex: Jo: Thurloe, Clerk of the Councel. A Summary of what the Lord Adrian Pauw, Ex∣traordinary Ambassador of the States General of the Vnited Provinces of the Low Countries, hath propounded to the Deputies of the Honorable Coun∣cel of State of the Parliament of England, the 24 / 14 of June, 1652. THe said Lord Ambassador having heretofore abun∣dantly Declared, That the States General (as it
will be found and always appear) have no ways deli∣berated, neither in publique nor in private, much less given any Charge, Order or Commission for commit∣ting the least Offence against the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, their Fleets, Ships, Of∣ficers or Subjects, but rather they should be met with the usual Civilities and Kindnesses, and with the ordi∣nary Expressions of Friendship; therefore none can any wise call into question their sincere Intentions for the maintaining and increasing the ancient and com∣mon Amity. For the same reason, That cannot be imputed to the said States General which hapned lately between both Fleets, nor should thence arise any Discontent or Offence, nor any cause of attempting against their Sub∣jects, being a thing directly contrary to the ancient Friendship and Correspondence between both Nati∣ons: And the said Encounter having hapned by meer Chance and without any design, the said Lord Am∣bassador hath propounded, Whether it were not better to lay aside that which is passed, in so much that it should be taken of both sides as a thing not done, and so all be left as before; and that there might a speedy order be taken for the redress of what hath been done since, in such sort, as no External nor Internal mark may remain of the same. Nevertheless, if the pleasure of this Honorable Councel is otherwise, although the said Ambassador hath plainly and sincerely related all which is come to the knowledge of his Superiors concerning what is passed, having received (as also the other Ambassadors) besides the former Informations, before his departing,
several remarkable and considerable Attestations in probanti forma, and hath heard that there are here quite other and contrary Informations, whence it doth appear, That the parties are disagreeing in their Evi∣dences, and so it is a hard matter to judge clearly of the Fact. The said Ambassador therefore hath thought fit to propound, That the things passed should be more exactly examined, and necessary Informations made by either of the parties, or conjunctim by both; that after certain knowledge gotten, the truth may be dis∣covered by Commissioners specially deputed of both sides upon this matter, to know which of the two hath made the first attempt, and given cause to the follow∣ing Disorders. The said Ambassador doth Declare, That if it may appear that the Admiral of the States General hath made the first Assault, he shall not onely be disowned in the like case, and his Fact disapproved of by the said States General, as having transgressed against their Or∣ders and Commission, but they shall also cause him to be punished for the same, according to the importance of his Attempt, for having disobeyed their Commands, and chiefly for having given just cause of Offence to their good Friends and Neighbors: desiring also of this Honorable Councel, that if on the contrary it be found true by the Informations, That the Admiral of the Commonwealth of England hath given occasion to the said Encounter, and hath the first Assaulted, it be likewise Declared, That the Parliament will in that case disown the said Admiral, and command the same punishment to be put upon him.
It is to be believed, That the sincere Intentions of the States General will not onely appear, and all suspi∣tions be taken away, but that the means of a just Repa∣ration and necessary satisfaction will be easily found, other States and Commonwealths having taken the same course and followed the same method with good success, whereof the Lord Ambassador hath produced divers examples. And to the end that the like Inconveniences may no more happen hereafter, the Lord Ambassador hath Declared, That the States General have never had the least intention, nor have yet any at this time, to lessen in no ways the Honor and Dignity of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England; but that they have given command heretofore, as also since the late un∣happy Accident, new Order, That upon meetings and salutings of the Fleets or Ships of War, concerning the striking down of the Flag, and what belong to it, there should be the same Honor done to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England as was formerly done during the other Government, hoping by this means to give and receive content reciprocally. And as it is most necessary to confirm the mutual Friendship between both Nations, That the negotia∣tion of the Treaty between both Commonwealths be advanced and brought to an end as soon as can be, the said Lord Ambassador hath represented and earnestly desired, That since the Lords Extraordinary Ambas∣sadors have after divers Conferences, by their last Re∣monstrance, manifested their Superiors Intention con∣cerning the said Treaty, it should also please the Honor∣able Councel to express and signifie theirs clearly, that
it may appear what Differences are yet to be reconciled, that all Difficulties may be removed, to come the soon∣er to a good, firm and lasting Conclusion, by which the mindes may be on both sides pacified, and an ever∣lasting and undissoluble good Intelligence established. Moreover, the said Ambassador hath instantly desired; That all ways of Fact and Offences be inhibited and stopped by Order of the Honorable Councel, and chiefly, That the Persons, Ships and Goods of the Subjects of the United Provinces, as well Military as others, be indifferently freed and released from their Restraint and Detention, and all that have been or are by Force detained, be set at Liberty; and that the In∣nocents may receive no more hurt or trouble, as we are ready and resolved to do the same of our part. The said Lord Ambassador hath also desired it may please the said Honorable Councel to make known to him, without loss of time, their good Intentions and Resolution upon what is abovesaid; and chiefly upon the Continuation of the Treaty begun, the Cessation of all ways of Fact upon the relaxation of the Ships detained and arrested persons and goods of the Sub∣jects of the United Provinces, seeing he hath lost no time to Declare sincerely from his Superiors, and assure the said Honorable Councel of the continuation of their good Affection and perfect Friendship.
14th of June, 1652. At the Councel of State at White-Hall. THat the Commissioners appointed to Treat with the Lord Pauw, Extraordinary Ambassador from the United Provinces, do insist upon a sight of his Autho∣rities before they proceed to this Treaty. A Paper from the Lord Pauw the 15th of June, 1652. To the Right Honorable, The Councel of State of the Commonwealth of England. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the States Ge∣neral of the United Provinces having had the Honor to come twice in Conference with your Ho∣nors Commissioners, and there to propound several things concerning the quality he cometh in, and the re-establishing the good Friendship and perfect In∣telligence of both Nations, intreated this Honorable Councel, That it may please your Honors to consider what the said Commissioners shall Report, that he may receive a speedy and favorable Answer, as also be ex∣cused for making so much instance, seeing that he is forced to it by the conjuncture of such pressing Af∣fairs, and for timely preventing of the inconvenients which might follow.

Tuesday the 15th of June, 1652. At the Councel of State at White-Hall. Ordered, THat Report be made to the Parliament of what the Counsel have Ordered and Directed touching the Conference with the Lord Pauw, Extraordinary Am∣bassador from the Lords the States General, and of the Papers by him delivered to the Commissioners of the Counsel, That by these Papers it not appearing to the Councel that the said Ambassador hath any power to Treat or Conclude; The Counsel have thought fit humbly to present and submit the whole to the Consideration of the Parliament for their Judgement thereupon. Translation of the Letter of the Lord Pauw to the Lord President of the Councel of State. My Lords, HAving communicated to my Lords the Ambas∣sadors Extraordinary of the United Provinces to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, what passed in my Audience and Conference with the Commissioners of the Councel of State, and having shewed unto them the Instructions and Orders of my Superiors, they have thought fit to address the in∣closed Paper to my Lords of the said Counsel of State: But for as much as Sir Oliver Flemimg Master of the
Ceremonies hath signified unto me, That their Excel∣lencies had thought fit to make a Report of the whole Business to the Parliament this morning, I judged it convenient to intreat your Excellency, That the said Paper may be put into the hands of the Reporter, to be communicated (as well as the other Propositions and Papers) to my Lords of the Parliament: Praying God (my Lord) to bless these Affairs for his Glory and the Prosperity of both Nations, I will remain ever The 16/26 June. 1652.

Hen: Scobell, Cleric. Parliamenti.
A Paper received from the Lord Pauw, 17 Iune, 1652. To the Right Honorable, The Councel of State. THe Ambassador Extraordinary of the States Ge∣neral of the United Provinces of the Low-Coun∣treys, finde himself necessitated to Demand most in∣stantly another Audience of the Lords Commissioners of the Honorable Councel, and that as soon as possible may be, as well to receive from them the most desired Answer upon those things that he hath already pro∣pounded in the last Conferences, as also to make to their Honors, according to the express Charge he hath from his Superiors, others Overtures upon things of so high Concernment, that they can suffer no Delay; Therefore he desireth earnestly, That this just Demand be as soon as can be granted unto him. A Translation of the Paper of the Lord Ambassador Pauw, 17 June, 1652. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces hath represented to the Lords Commission∣ers of the Honorable Councel of State, in the third Conference held this day, as followeth: That the States of the United Provinces have shew∣ed themselves, and are yet resolved to remain fast to the Amity and intimate Correspondence with this Commonwealth, as they have yet of late made it ap∣pear,
by granting, during these falling out, to the Com∣pany of English Merchants Adventurers setled in Hol∣land, all the Security and Protection that they have desired, even with this annexed Promise, To continue in the same good will towards them, though the Distemper should proceed further. That which hapned about Dover or the Downs should not breed a general Quarrel between the two States, but that the same Mischance should be taken for a per∣sonal action, for which those are to answer who shall be found to have exceeded their Commission. And to the end that this Business might be compo∣sed according to the Fact, and the necessary satisfaction done, That it were most fit and expedient to have it examined by Commissioners deputed of both sides, to have that person punished which shall be found guilty according to the use and Maxims of all States and Commonwealths, by which means, their quiet and tranquility, as well within as without with their Neigh∣bors, is conserved. Moreover, That the Ships of War meeting at Sea, and behaving themselves as before and during the time of the former Government, there shall be there upon no more dispute hereafter. And that when the Confederation now to be done shall be concluded, according to the earnest desire of the States General, the Friendship between both States and their Subjects shall be more perfect, per∣manent, confident and inviolable; and the truly Or∣thodox Religion, which they by Gods special favor do profess, shall have a most potent and sure pro∣tection.
The said Ambassador having again propounded the aforesaid means, and having added to them several Reasons and Arguments of great Strength, hath de∣sired to be informed thereupon of the intent of the Ho∣norable Councel of State, offering to answer and give satisfaction upon the remaining Difficulties. Or otherwise, That it might please the Lords Com∣missioners to confer with him upon that matter, or to propound on their part what they may finde to be rea∣sonable and just to compose speedily that unhappy Accident, promising to contribute of his side all that shall any ways be in his power, with his most earnest Intreaties, That the Honorable Councel might be without delay acquainted withal, and that the time and present Affairs might be so well husbanded, that the Business might be compounded by convenient ways, and without interruption of the publique Peace and further exacerbation of the Mindes and Spirits of both Nations. All which the said Ambassador hath recommended and offered with much Affection to pre∣vent all Provocations and Inconvenients. The Answer of the Councel of State to the Summary of the Lord Adrian Pauw, Extraordinary Am∣bassador of the States General of the Vnited Pro∣vinces, presented to the Councel the 24/14 of this instant June. WHat the thoughts and judgement of the Par∣liament have been concerning the late Inten∣tions
of the Lords your Superiors, and the late Actings of your Fleet within the very Roads of England; your Excellency hath understood by the Parliaments An∣swer given unto the three Papers of the Extraordinary Ambassadors of your State before your Excellencies arrival here; which Answer, together with the state of the Fact, and the Examinations thereupon had, and then given in, your Lordship takes notice of in your Papers now before the Councel; neither doth any cause appear to vary from that Judgement upon any thing since offered by your Excellency. And since the At∣tempt made by the Fleet of the United Provinces, with the Preparations thereunto (all projected and acted by way of surprise and in a time of Treaty) had the same prevailed, would have highly hazarded the safety of England. It cannot stand with reason, That this Commonwealth after such a Warning and great Pre∣servation (which they owe onely to God) should leave it self naked and exposed to the like danger for the fu∣ture, or suffer it self in a case so evident and notorious, under pretence of more solemn Examinations, or from examples of other States which suit not with this case, to be diverted from applying Remedies agreeable to the nature of this evil. And therefore the Councel can∣not admit of what is propounded by your Excellency, either as to the passing by what is done, or attending the way of Examinations mentioned in your Papers, which to them seem needless, dilatory, and impra∣cticable. Touching the overture of re-admitting the late Treaty begun by the other Lords Ambassadors Extraordinary of your Nation, after so high a breach thereof, we
conceive it cannot be seasonable until the Wound now under Cure be througly closed and healed. And whereas your Excellency hath thought fit frequently to assert the amicable Minde and Intentions of the Lords your Superiors towards this Common∣wealth, and hath given instances of some late Or∣ders and Acts tending to the expression of the same; specially concerning the Honor and Respect to be paid unto this Commonwealth at Sea (being the ancient and undoubted Right of this Nation) and granting of the Protection desired by the English Merchants now at Rotterdam: The Parliament hath not been want∣ing on their part from time to time to manifest their desires of Amity with the United Provinces of the Low Countreys, nor to afford unto the people thereof residing here all necessary Protection though unde∣sired; Nevertheless, in the present posture of Affairs it cannot reasonably be expected, That this State should forbear the prosecution mentioned in the Par∣liaments said Answer for the ends therein expressed. White-Hall, 19. June, 1652.
A Translate of a Paper of the Lord Ambassa∣dor Pauw of the 1/22 July June, desiring a Confe∣rence with the Commissioners of the Councel of State. To the Right Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces, having 29th / 19th of this instant about the Even∣ing, received by the hands of Sir Oliver Fleming the Answer which the Honorable Councel of State hath been pleased to give him, upon the Summary of those things by him propounded the 24th / 14th, He findeth himself bound to Demand most instantly another Conference with the Lords Commissioners of the Councel, that he may explain unto them more particularly and more fully his Superiors Intentions, and the better perform the Duty of his Office. Another Paper of the Lord Pauw of the 21th of Iune, 1652. To the Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces having the 29th / 19th of June in the Evening some∣thing late, received by the hands of Sir Oliver Fleming, the Answer which the Honorable Counsel hath been pleased to give him upon the Summary of the things propounded the 24th / 14th of the same Moneth.
He hath thought himself bound for the better per∣formance of the Duty of his Imployment, to assert again here ingeniously as he hath done before, accord∣ing to the Notice and Knowledge he hath of the most intimate Deliberations and Consultations of the States General his Superiors, That they having no ways pro∣pounded, deliberated nor resolved to give any Suspi∣tion, or the least occasion of Offence against the Fleet or Ships of this Commonwealth: He did believe, That it would have been sufficient to take away all conceits of the contrary; He hath also truly represented the Ac∣cident happened between the two Fleets by Dover or the Downs, as it came to the knowledge of his Supe∣riors by sincere Attestations of trusty and blameless Persons: And hath, to avoid all further Contestations, in stead of insisting upon those Proofs, opened a way by which the true and infallible Knowledge of the same might have been found out, and by that means the sa∣tisfaction done that could be lawfully pretended. Therfore that mischance cannot be any ways imputed to his Superiors, who never had the least thought, nor in any sort contributed towards the Infraction of the Friendship, which hath always been most dear to them, and less towards the Interruption of the Treaty of Confederation; for the perfecting of which they have had, and have still here their Extraordinary Ambas∣sadors. That may sufficiently appear by the firm and con∣stant Resolution of his Superiors, that have never been wlling to grant any Letters of Mart or Reprisal upon the continual Complaints and reiterated Petitions, even the Importunities of the Persons interessed in the
ships taken, arrested and confiscated here, for fear of giving any occasion of Discontent to this Common∣wealth. The same is clearly seen by the Protection granted to the English Company setled at Rotterdam (though ex superabundanti, and they had no need of the same) to express more specially their good Intentions, the which may be also justified by all their actions; none of this State having yet to this present received the least Damage, Offence or Injury for all the said Proceed∣ings; even our ships of War having rather suffered them∣selves to be brought into the Ports of England, and there to be detained, then endeavored to defend them∣selves against those whom they have always made ac∣count to be their good Friends, as having never heard of any publication to the contrary. And to make that Testimony of Friendship the more Authentical to this Commonwealth, His Superiors have sent a second extraordinary Embassage, to disabuse all those that might be pre-occupated or mis-informed, and to help the furthering and perfecting of the said Treaty. But in case all those Overtures and means of Recon∣ciliation be rejected, and it be resolved here to make use of those ways, which in stead of asswaging shall in∣crease the evil, and which being against all Maxims of all States and Commonwealths (who never give their Judgement upon Signs, Presumptions and Suspitions, but upon Infallible and Unrepreachable proofs, and as clear as the Sun is at noon, and who during a Treaty do always command most strictly a cessation of all ways of Fact) shall the more surprize my Superiors, and cause
strange Alarms to their Peoples, by making those suffer which are guiltless and come from far, who never had the least suspition or heard the least rumor of a falling out between both States. Whereupon, the said Ambassadors must needs be very much surprized and sorry, desiring, That the said Lords Commissioners be pleased (that no way for a happy Agreement may be neglected) to propound for on their part some other expedients (seeing they have expressed in their last Answer given to the other Extra∣ordinary Ambassadors, That the most sweet ways will be always the most pleasing to them) which may be fit, satisfactory and convenient to compose as soon as can be that unhappy Business, and restore all things in their first temper. And that in the mean time they be also pleased to inhibit all ways of Fact, and to give Order, That the Ships detained may be speedily set at liberty, praying very earnestly the Honorable Councel to explain their minde thereupon, as also to give an Answer upon the last Articles of the Paper exhibited the 27/17 of June, to make him the more able to contribute his best Offices for the good and strengthning of the two Common∣wealths. This 21 June / 1 July 1652.
Another Paper of the Lord Pauw 23 June, 1652. To the Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Provinces considering the importance of the Af∣fairs now in hands, and the eminent dangers that threat∣en both States, is forced to be importunate with your Honors, in recommending most earnestly the care of your Answer upon his last Conference, and intreating you with all his Affections, That the same may be a convenient and lawful means to assway the Differences and restore the Union and perfect Intelligence be∣tween both Commonwealths and their reciprocal Subjects. This 23 June / 3 July 1562. The Answer of the Parliament to that part of the Paper given in by the Lord Pauw, whereby he desires the Commissioners of the Councel to propound what they shall think reasonable and just to compose speedily the present Differences between this Commonwealth and the Lords the States General of the United Provinces. Friday the 25th of June, 1652. THat the Lords the States General of the United Provinces do pay and satisfie unto this Common∣wealth
the Charges and Damages this State hath su∣stained and been put unto, by the Preparations of the said States General, and their Attempts this summer; the Particulars whereof shall be in due time produced. II. That upon the Payment of the Sum to be agreed up on as aforesaid, for Charges and Damages, or secu∣ring the same to the satisfaction of the Parliament, there shall follow immediately thereupon a Cessation of all Acts of Hostilility, and the Ships and Goods ta∣ken since the late Differences shall be released. III. The two former Propositions being assented unto, and put in Execution, the security for the time to come, which the Parliament does expect, is by both States contracting a firm Alliance, and Consistency of Inte∣rest for the good of both; which the Parliament of England is willing on their part by all just Ways and Means to endeavor. Friday 25o Junii, 1652. At the Councel of State at White-Hall. Ordered, THat the Commissioners appointed formerly to meet and Treat with the Lord Pauw, Extraordinary Am∣bassador of the United Provinces, Do deliver unto the said Lord Ambassador the Answer of the Parliament of
the 25th of June instant, to that part of the Paper pre∣sented unto them by the Councel, from the said Lord Pauw, whereby his Lordship doth desire the Commission∣ers of the Councel to propound what they should think reasonable and just, to compose speedily the present Dif∣ferences between this Commonwealth and the Lords the States General of the United Provinces. Ex: Jo: Thurloe, Clerk of the Councel. A Paper of the Lord Pauw, 26 Iune, 2652. To the Right Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces, having yesterday had a Conference with the Lords Commissioners of the Counsel, and received from them two Papers upon the same Subject; He de∣sireth earnestly they will be pleased to give again order without loss of time, for a new Conference with the said Lords Commissioners, that some things may be better explained and cleared of both sides, and a spee∣dy Composure made of the Business. This 26 June / 6 July 1652.
Another Paper of the Lord Pauw, the same day. To the Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces hath propounded at a Conference held the 26 of June / 6 of July 1652 with the Lords Commissioners of the Councel of State the following Articles. That the States General having been forced for the Reasons already alledged, to make extraordinary Pre∣parations at Sea, have been put to exceeding great Charges, which do continue yet at this present. That their Subjects, beside the extream great Losses they have had heretofore at Sea, have received very great ones by the Letters of Mart granted as well a∣gainst the French as against the said Subjects of the United Provinces, and upon some other pretences. That the State and their subjects have suffered much, and received great Damages of late by the taking and spoiling of several Ships of War, and by the Arresting of all the Merchants ships. And that if it should be thought of a Reimbursing of the charges & damages, they should be weighed of both sides one against the other, and that it should be consi∣dered, whether they have not been greater on the Uni∣ted Provinces side. However there must a reasonable Estimation be made, and the Business not referred to aproduction of Accounts, which requireth a long Examination. And if the said Commissioners be pleased to cause that Estimation to be made in moderate Terms on
their part, it will appear from thenee whether there is at this side any willingness or intent to Compound the things passed according to reason and friendly, or whether there is a Design to propound things impossi∣ble and unfeasible. As concerning the Confederacy between both Com∣monwealths, and the mutual Help assisting one an∣other against those that shall offend or assault them, the other Extraordinary Ambassadors have made the true Intentions of their Superiors known thereupon, and are ready to go on in the same Negotiation, and to bring it to an end without loss of time. If the said Lords Commissioners do think fit that the said Confederacy should be more ample and more strict, that will not onely be more pleasing to the said Ambassador, but he also entreateth very earnestly, that he may be clearly informed thereupon. Putting at the same time into consideration, whe∣ther it will not be most convenient, even most necessary to give order, That the Fleets do not come near nor en∣gage any more one with the other; the said Ambassador fearing much it should soon be commanded otherways at the other side, chiefly if the abovesaid Order be not speedily given here. And desiring moreover, That the Ships which are arrested may be speedily released, and that no Prize may be longer detained, to the end that the Mindes be∣ing something pacified, they may be rather invited by mutual Friendship and Love, and of their own accord, then brought by constraint to unite again by an undis∣soluble Confederacy. As also, That the said Ambassador may receive up∣on
these so speedy and so favorable a Declaration, that he may with more hope of success use his Endeavors with his Superiors, and effect what in this conjuncture of time and Affairs, is most expedient and necessary, and that he may do it without delay, according to the Express Order he hath from his said Superiors, which he is bound to follow exactly. The Councel of State having considered of the Paper this evening delivered in by their Commissioners from the Lord Pauw Extraordinary Ambassador of the Lords the States General of the United Provinces, and finding therein no clear or direct Answer to the last Paper of Demands tendered unto his Excellency in the name of the Parliament, They do desire a speedy and positive Answer thereunto, at least unto the first Article thereof, especially, because that being assented unto, the Councel might speedily apply themselves to a reasonable and moderate ascertaining the sum; to the end, That immediately upon performance of the se∣cond Article, all acts of Hostility might be forborn, and restitution made of the Ships and Goods detained. The third Article in the nature thereof not requiring so present a Transaction. White-Hall, 26. June, 1652. Ex: Jo: Thurloe Clerk of the Councel.
A Paper from the Lord Pauw the 17th of June, 1652. To the thrice Illustrious Councel of State; THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces having considered the Answer delivered un∣to him yesterday at evening by Sir Oliver Fleming up∣on the Considerations heretofore by him propounded, doth most instantly crave, That it may please this thrice Illustrious Councel of State to grant him one other Conference this afternoon, that he may more particularly deduct the Intentions of his Superiors, and withal likewise satisfie both their Excellencies and his own duties. Signed, Adrian Pauw. This 27 June / 7 July 1652. Another Paper of the Lord Pauw, 27th June, 1652. To the Right Honorable, The Councel of State. WHile the Extraordinary Ambassador of the Uni∣ted Provinces was busied about the writing of the Answer upon the Paper delivered to him yesterday very late by Sir Oliver Fleming from this Honorable Councel, he was to his great grief informed, That this
Commonwealths Fleet was gone to Sea to execute some design. The said Ambassador hath also by several Letters received Order from his Superiors, That in case he could not obtain, by all possible endeavors, the Cessa∣tion of acts of Hostility, he should with all speed re∣turn back again into the Low-Countreys to acquaint them with his Negotiation. And as the said Ambassador can advance no further in the said Negotiation of which he was charged to give an Account to his said Superiors with all speed, he therefore desireth to be admitted to morrow to take his leave of this Honorable Councel, to go over as soon as can be in the ship of War whereof John Verhaef is Captain, who was commanded to bring him hither and back again; and that he may have a Letter or a Pass of the Honorable Counsel, to be transported over without any hinderance or trouble, and without being molested or arrested by the Parliaments Ships. The other Extraordinary Ambassadors having in the mean time informed and shewed him that they had received the like Order and Command, have intreated him to demand in their name, That they may also at the same time to morrow have Audience to take their leave of this Honorable Councel; as also be provided of such Ships as they shall have need of for the Trans∣port of their Persons, Train and Baggage; as also with such Passes as shall be necessary for the security of their Passage. The said Ambassador desireth, That he may re∣ceive a speedy Answer upon these, being a thing of very great Importance.
27th June, 1652. At the Councel of State at White Hall. UPon Consideration of the Report made of the Paper delivered in to the Commissioners this evening by the Lord Pauw, Extraordinary Ambassador from the United Provinces, The Councel hold themselves ob∣liged to represent the same to the Parliament, which they shall do upon Tuesday morning at their first sit∣ing, and in the mean time can give no other Answer to the said Lord ambassador upon this subject. Ex: Jo: Thurloe Clerk of the Councel. A Paper of the Lord Pauw of the 28th Iune, 1652. To the Right Honorable Councel of State. THe Extraordinary Ambassador of the United Pro∣vinces having seen the Answer of the Honorable Councel given upon his Proposition made yesterday, hath thought fit to Declare again, That his Intention is to do his best when he shall be arrived in his Coun∣trey, That upon the Overtures made to him, or can be yet made, there may be such convenient means and fit expedients found, chiefly to make all misapprehensions
and alienations of mindes, as well as all Acts of Ho∣stility cease; That a fair Agreement upon the Busi∣ness passed, and consequently a firm Union and Confe∣deracy between both States, as also a good settlement between both Nations may ensue, from which their own Prosperity and Happiness may flow, and all Incon∣veniences be prevented for the future. And as his Resolution is godly, Honest; and if it succeedeth, most conducing to the common safety; as also, that it must be speedily, and before things pro∣ceed further, put in execution. The said Ambassador desireth, That it may please to the Honorable Councel to weigh all these, and to Order, That all may be done that may be for that purpose, towards the promoting of the same. And as the time is most precious, it will be very necessary, That he may speedily be admitted to his Audiences; as also, he may soon have the fit Expediti∣ons concerning the Ship that brought him, and stayeth for his return at Gravesend, to bring him back again into the Low-Countreys, with the Pass he hath demand∣ed for his security, and to avoid all misfortunes that might meet him at Sea. The said Ambassador doth wholly perswade him∣self, that the Honorable Councel will be pleased to give Order, That in consideration of his Quality, he be used in the same maner at his departure and taking of his leave, as he hath been at his coming and recepti∣on, for which favor he thanketh the Honorable Coun∣cel most kindly.
Another Paper of the same Date. To the Right Honorable Councel of State. THe Extrordinary Ambassador hath thought fit to propound here, whether this Honorable Councel could not approve, That after his Report made to the Lords the States General his Secretary, or some other faithful person, should be sent to maintain and foment the mutual Correspondence, and deliver as well as re∣ceive from both States, what may serve to the com∣pounding of things passed, and to the re-establishing of the Union and Confederacy. And whether to this end the Honorable Councel would be pleased to command such Passes to be grant∣ed, by vertue of which, he might freely and safely come back and stay here, as long as the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, or the Lords States General may finde it convenient. Or otherwise, That it may please to the Honorable Councel to name or denote here, some body that be agreeable to them, and fit to receive the Letters that might be written upon that subject, and to solicite the Answers thereunto.
A Paper of the three Ambassadors, dated 28 Iune, 1652. To the Councel of State of the Commonwealth of England. WHereas we the Ambassadors of the Lords States of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, by their last Letters have received Order, without any delay, to make haste again to our Countrey, and there to give an accompt of what we have here done; We therefore do earnestly pray this Senate to suffer us, that we take, as it befits us, leave of this most Illustrious Assembly, and may have ships that may conveniently serve for our own Transportation, and for that of our Train and Goods; and besides, That such safe Con∣ducts or Passes be granted us that may make our Jour∣ney safe. Here are some of our ships ready, viz. Captain Jaep den Boer, with three smaller Vessels of the City of Dort. Signed, I: Cats. G: Schaep. Vandeperre.
The Lord Pauw's Speech in Parliament, at his taking leave, 30. June, 1652. Right Honorable, THe States General of the United Provinces of the Low-Countries, have first sent their Extraordi∣nary Ambassadors to the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of England, to do their earnest endeavors for the strengthning and confirming of the ancient Amity and Friendship between both Nations, and for the Establishing of an everlasting Alliance between both States, and to bring those things to a happy conclusion for the common Utility and Security; and afterwards the Lord William Newport, a Member of the States of Holland and West Friezland, to take away some Doubts, and to witness more fully of the good Inten∣tions of our Superiors concerning the Treaty of Con∣federacy. At last it hath pleased the said Lords States to pre∣pare, some few days ago, a new Extraordinary Em∣bassage to the said Parliament, and to give me that Imployment, with an express Command to bear again over and above, witness of their faithful dealing, and of their most sincere intention towards this Common∣wealth; and to dissolve and remove all the strange and unthought of accidents, and all the stoppings and hin∣derances thereby caused and opposed to their good in∣tent; by which means, I might by all my endeavors promote to a happy Conclusion, the Treaty of Alliance already begun. To what end it hath been propounded amongst other
things, That there should be an Enquiry and Exami∣nation made by fit persons of both Commonwealths, of all what lately passed as was done between the two Fleets without any Design, but by meer chance, and a just and lawful Satisfaction stated: For we do witness and protest before God and all the Christian world, as well as in the presence of the Parliament of the Com∣monwealth of England, That the States have not had the least minde of Offending or Troubling this Com∣monwealth, much less of committing any Hostility against them; but rather that they have had nothing more in their hearts then to Entertain and Maintain with this State all true Friendship and firm Peace; even to come to a stricter Union and Confederacy with them. But as it hath unhappily happened, That after ex∣traordinary Pains taken, and all the best Endeavors done of all sides to conserve the common Quiet, and remove all hindrances, both Embassages have not one∣ly missed their Ends, but that to the contrary, not onely great Troubles have been given, extraordinary Losses have been caused, but huge Dangers; as also Acts of Hostility not looked for, neither at any time before de∣clared, are threatned from the English Fleet to the States of the United Provinces. Both Embassage hath thought fit to prevent the en∣suing Evils, and upon a Business so unusual, to return into their own Countrey to give an Accompt of their Negotiation to their Superiors, and to be acquainted with their further Commands. To that end we do present our selves together to the Supream Authority of this Commonwealth, declare,
That we have a Command to return back, and that we are ready to rake our Journey. We have given notice to the Honorable Councel of State of this Commonwealth, of those things that are necessary to us for our Transport, according to our Quality and the season, and do look and wait for an Answerthereupon, hoping that the necessary Expeciti∣ons shall be done. In the mean time we cannot be wanting to our Du∣ty; but are forced again to desire most earnestly; That all our ships that have been brought into the Ports of England, & there detained of late against our thoughts, and before any Declaration of Hostility issued our, and whereof the Commanders are unawares and guiltless, having not given the least, nor to no body occasion of Dispute; may be relcased and suffered to go freely, with their officers, mariners, merchandizes, packs and loads, and the whole company, and to perform their Journcy without any Wrong or Injury; which we do pretend to be due to our old Friendship, to the Right of Nati∣ons, and have been observed between Christian Peo∣ples, as well as we hope to have it granted by the Ju∣stice and Equity of this Great and most Honorable Assembly. Furthermore, We do intreat with all our hearts the great God of Heavens, who is the Author and Pro∣moter of Peace and Concordance, That he will be plea∣sed to afford such thought and counsel to the Parlia∣ment of the Commonwealth of England, as may tend to the mutual Peace of both States, to the conservation of the Christian Reformed and Orthodox Religion, which hath no better Foundations then upon Peace,
and can never better thrive and flourish then by Peace, and will without any doubt be afflicted and destroyed by our Troubles and falling out; As also that be will in his Mercy prevent the Destructions and Miseries of Wars, and bestow abundantly his Heavenly Blessings upon both Commonwealths; We shall end upon these Wishes. And being commanded to Repair in haste into our countrey, we shall with all thankful Acknowledge∣ment for all Favors done to us, as well as with all due Respects, take our leave of this most Honorable and Supream Assembly of the Commonwealth of England, with confidence that they will not deny us those things which we have already expressed, and are granted eve∣ry where to the Ambassadors for their quality and se∣curity. Pronounced and delivered to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, the 30. June / 20. July 1652 by the Extraordinary Ambassadors of the States General of the United Provinces. We do besides deliver a Petition put into our hands by the Dutch Merchants, Desiring they may enjoy the same Security and Protection which hath been lately granted in the best Form to the English Merchants in our Provinces. We desire also at last, That besides the two Dutch Men of War, there should be another of those that are in the Downs granted to us for our Passage, seeing we are a very great Company, wherein are some Wo∣men of Quality, with much Carriage, which will put us to great Inconveniences, besides the heat of this sea∣son, except we be fitted with the said shin. FINIS.
