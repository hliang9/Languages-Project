Britains sorrowful Lamentation, For the Loss of their Gracious QUEEN MARY Who departed this Life, the 28th. of December, 1694. To the Tune of, The Bleeding Heart. WHat dismal News is this I hear, Each Brittain shedding of a Tear, I do not mean a Tear alone, But heavy Sighs and dismal Groans. Each one struck dumb, amazing stands, With aiking Hearts and wringing Hands, Oh! wretched Day that e're was seen, The loss of our most Gracious Queen. A Queen whose Worth could not be nam'd, A Queen for Vertue still proclaim'd; And all her Subjects needs must owne, So brave a Queen was never known. Oh! Britain, Britain, mourn with speed, For sure there never was more need, Than at this day for our hard Fate. Our King has lost his Royal Mate. No Tongue can tell the Grief and Wo, Each Subject now does undergo; Since Your Most Royal Queen is dead, 'Twould make a Heart of Stone to bleed, Where this same dreadful News does come, It struck amazement in each one, And all with mournful Voice did say, Oh! wretched and unhappy day. What must I do? where must we go? Our Queen that lov'd her Country so, By cruel Death is snatch'd away; Oh! why did not Death longer stay? This is a Land of Grief and Wo, Which does with Sorrow overflow; So great a Loss was never seen, To loose so vertuous a Queen. A Queen belov'd of all that knew, How to their Country to be true; A Queen that of Mercy had great store, Oh! such a Queen was ne're before. But Oh! She's gone, and left us here, Full of Distraction and Dispair; No Comfort now is to be seen, Since we have lost our Gracious Queen. This is a day of Mourning now, This is a day of Sorrow too; This is a day of Wo and Grief, This day we mourn without relief. For sighing, this I needs must say, The Good are soonest took away, Altho She's here no longer seen, In Heav'n She Reigns a Glorious Queen. FINIS. Printed at London, And Re-printed at Edinburgh by John Reid, 1695.
