THE King of France's Letter TO THE Earl of Tyrconnel, Found in a Ship Laden with Arms for Ireland. MY LORD, AS we are fully Inform'd of the deplorable Misfortunes of our Royal Brother, (His Majesty of Great Britain) and of His In∣tentions to Honor Our Court with His Presence, till we can Accommodate His Return to His Ungrateful Country and Kingdom, suitable to His Grandeur and Merit; so we thought it convenient to send You the most proper Instructions VVe, and Our Council, could Suggest, whereby we might render your endeavours as Serviceable and Material as may be for your Royal Master's Interest. The Kingdom of Ireland seems, at present, to be your Master's last Stake, and there∣fore must be managed wisely; Nor shall you want Opportunity of making the most of your Game, since we are stedfastly resolv'd to give the Army in England such powerful Diversion, that we doubt not to render them wholly incapable of turning their Arms towards You: In the mean time, we advise you to make all the Levies you can; and by no means admit any Heretical Villains into the least Command, Civil or Military: VVe have sent you Arms for Thirty Thousand; which, with what your self can supply, will Accouter a Formidable Body of Men, and fully sufficient for the entire Reduction of that Kingdom. VVe shall also take care to furnish you with Money; and, in the mean time, we advise you to seize, without distinction, all the Hereticks Goods and Estates, which will serve for a present Advance: VVe will also supply you with some Expert Commanders, and all necessary Engines of War; and for the supply of Ammunition, we are Inform'd of your care, in your speedy setting up Mills for the making of Powder, &c. VVe likewise advise you to keep strong and diligent Guards in all your Sea-Ports and Coasts; to set up Beacons in convenient places throughout the Kingdom, whereby the Country may be ready at the least Alarm: And as we doubt not of the Assistance of God in so Just a Cause, so we may, with all human probability, conclude of the speedy Re-establishment of Our Royal Brother in his Throne & Kingdom. LONDON, Printed for T. P. 1688.
