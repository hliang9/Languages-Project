THE SPEECH OF PATRICK EARL OF MARCHMONT His Majesties High Commissioner To the PARLIAMENT, AT the Conclusion of the Session, the first of September 1698. My Lords and Gentlemen, THe Season of Harvest is so far advanced, that the Members of this House are beginning to long for a Close of this Session, that they may go to the Countrey to see to the Reaping of their Cropt of Corns, which God be thanked is so much bettered since you meet together, that the Fear the Countrey was under of Dearth and Scarcity, is changed to a good Hope, which is very comfort∣able to all, especially the poorer sort. Albeit your Session has not been long, yet when what you have done in the Service of your King and Countrey is duely Considered; All must be satis∣fied that you have improven your time diligently, and to very good purpose: I need not recapitulat your Acts made, they are so recent; but this I may assert, that what you have done makes a good Demonstration of your most hearty Affection to, and intire Trust in your Soveraign Lord the KING, and of your Disposition and Readiness to serve him in that which is his greatest Satisfaction, His Fatherly Design of increasing the Prosperity and Happiness
of His good Subjects; and to do every thing towards the Support of His Ma∣jesties Honour and Government, which can be expected from a People deep∣ly sensible of, and thankful for the Great Blessing of GOD to this Nation, of Bringing and Establishing a Pious, Wise, Couragious, and active Protestant KING, to bear the Crown and sway the Scepter of this Kingdom. I will not fail God willing fully to represent to His Majesty, both the great¦ness of your Performances, and the Heartiness, Alacrity and Calmness of your Procedure, and I am very perswaded His Majesty will not only be well satis∣fied of what you have done, but will also heartily accept it as a clear evidence of your firm and unalterable Loyalty and good Affection to him, and Zeal in His Service. My Lords and Gentlemen, AS I have good Reason to be confident, that you will do it; So I do earnestly recommend to you, that when you go to your several homes, you will make it your Business to put the people in remem∣brance of the great things his Majesty has done for them, and how constant and effectual his happy endeavours have been, and are even to this Moment for procuring their peace and comfort, and their enjoyment of their Religi∣on, Properties, Laws and Liberties which formerly were in great danger, but now by the blessing of GOD upon his Majesties Endeavours, are rescued, e∣stablished, and as we have reason to hope, secured against the malicious De∣signs of His Majesties and our Enemies. And I also recommend to you in your several Stations, the Preservation of the Peace, the due Execution of the Laws; which is indeed the Nurse of peace, and the charitable maintenance of the Poor, who by the hardships of this and former years are become very numerous: That so the Works of Piety and Charity increasing and flourishing in this Nation by the example of you who represent it; There may be good ground of hopeing, that Almighty GOD will bless and establish both the King and the People.
