¶ By the King. IAMES, by the grace of GOD King of England, Scot∣land, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To Our right tru∣stie, and right welbeloued Councellour, WILLIAM Lord Knollys, Viscount Wal∣lingford, Master of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, And to Our trustie and well∣beloued the Councell of the same Court, And to the Master and Councell of the said Court for the time being, Greeting. WHEREAS Wee haue heretofore publi∣shed seuerall Commissions, with Instructi∣ons and Directions to you Our Master
and Councell of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, for compounding for Wards, Ideots and Lunatiques, now that time and experience haue produced the know∣ledge of sundry defects, that otherwise could not easily haue been foreseene, which are to bee supplied by explanation and ad∣dition to the same Our Instructions, ac∣cording to Our gracious purpose for the good of Our louing Subiects, & Our espe∣ciall care for the true answering of Our Reuenues. And forsomuch as it doth ap∣peare by common experience, in the course which hath beene helde since the first erection of Our Court of Wards and Li∣ueries, That partly by the slackenesse of the Friends of the Wards, vpon the decease of the Parents or Ancestours, who haue forborne to offer timely Composition, sometimes with opinion, that no Tytle could be found for Vs, and somtimes with purpose to suppresse the same, & partly by the suite of other men, the Custodie of the bodies and lands of Our Wards, haue been committed to such persons, some for one
respect, some for another, as (notwithstan∣ding the care and prouidence of you the Master and Councell of Our Court, to bind them in great Bonds and Couenants for the well educating of the Children, and preseruation of their Inheritance) haue been carelesse of their education, married some in meane places, committed wastes and spoyles vpon their Lands, and in the end haue exacted greater summes of mo∣ney for the marriages of such Wards, then they ought to haue done in reason and e∣quity; notwithstanding any their disburse∣ments whatsoeuer for passing or procu∣ring the same. And whereas also Wee haue bene infor∣med by you the Master of the saide Court, that by reason of the great difficulties that haue bene found by the Court, vpon sight of Offices, and Surueyes only, to set downe Compositions for Wardships and Leases of Wards Lands, with such equalitie and moderation betweene Vs, and Our Sub∣iects, as were iust and reasonable; and that through want of due information in
that behalfe, much of the profit that might haue bene raised for Vs, hath bene diuer∣ted to diuers Sutors and Committees, who by obscuring the trueth of the Wards estate, and by misinforming of the Court therein, haue reaped greater profite, then was intended, if you could by ordinary meanes, haue come by the knowledge of their values; so as, both Wee haue receiued lesse then otherwise We should haue done, and the Wards found little ease in many cases. Wherefore, for the preuenting of these and the like inconueniences, and to the end that Our louing Subiects may stand assured, that Wee desire nothing more, then that their Children and their Lands; that shall fall vnto Vs by reason of Ward∣ships, might after their decease, bee com∣mitted to their neerest and trustiest friends, or to such as they, by Wil, or other∣wise, commit the charge vnto, vpon such valuable considerations, as are iust and reasonable: And to the intent that the Pa∣rents and Ancestours may depart in grea∣ter
peace, in hope of this Our gracious fauour; and their friendes may see their Children brought vp in pietie and lear∣ning, and may take such care as is fit, for the preseruation of their inheritance, if they wil seeke the same in time, and by such meanes as are fitte and conuenient; Wee haue thought good hereby to require you, the Master and Councell of the said Court for the time beeing, that in disposing and committing of the custodie of the Bodies and Lands of such Our Wards, whose An∣cestours are already deceased, or shall die from and after the date of these presents, and of such Ideots and Lunatiques, and their Estates, as shall fall vnto Vs from hencefoorth, you shal strictly and carefully obserue these Our Directions following. FIRST, that no Direction for the fin∣ding of any Office, bee giuen for Wardship of the Body and Lands of any Ward, vntill the ende of one moneth next after the death of the Ancestor of the Ward, but to the neerest and trustiest
friends of the Ward, or other persons no∣minated by the Ancestor in the Wards be∣halfe, who may in the meane time become Suitors for the same, among whom, choice may be made of the best and fittest: and if none of the Wards friends make petition by the end of the moneth, then it shall be lawfull for any other to petition, and to finde the Office for the said Wardship. ALSO, That no composition, agree∣ment or promise of any Wardship, or Lease of Lands bee made, vntill the Office bee found, and then such of the Friends to haue preferment, as tendered their Petiti∣ons within the moneth, they yeelding a reasonable Composition; and in default of them, such others as were or shall be Sui∣tors, yeelding also a reasonable Compo∣sition. ALSO, You shall doe your best in∣deuours to informe your selues as perti∣cularly as you may, by Commission, Sur∣uey or otherwise, of the truth of the Wards Estates, aswell of his Inheritance, as of his Goods and Chattels, and of the Estate of

BVT touching Lunatiques, let no com∣position bee taken for the committing of them or their Estates; but let such care be
had therein, as they may bee freely com∣mitted to their best and neerest friends, that can receiue no benefit by their death, and the Committees bound to answere, not onely the values found by Office, but the very iust value of their Estates vpon ac∣compts, for the benefit of such Lunatique, (if hee recouer) or of his next Heire, Exe∣cutors or Administrators, due regard bee∣ing had to the paines and charges of such Committees, in keeping, maintaining go∣uerning, and curing of the said distracted persons.

That the Receiuers account bee taken and declared euery yeere, according to the Statute of 32. Henr. Octaui, before the Master of the Wards, Attourney, & one or both of the Auditors; and after the determination of the sayd accompt, the Master, Attour∣ney, and the Auditor or Auditors, shall all of them set their hands to the Receiuers booke of Accompts, which is and shall be for the Receiuers charge and discharge, as the case shall require.

THAT all the accompts of the Feoda∣ries be likewise declared and certified eue∣ry Hillary Terme, to the Master and Coun∣cell of the Wards, openly at the sittings of the Officers in the Councell Chamber, that the Court may knowe how the re∣maines vpon their accompts bee satisfied and paide, and their accompts to be accor∣dingly returned into the Court, there to remaine. AND because Our purpose in this course, which now is taken, is to raise with as little grieuance as may be to Our louing Subiects, that reasonable benefit which ought to come vnto Vs, by the Marriages of Our Wards, and by their Leases of their Lands, whereof a great part hath been di∣uerted by Grants to Committees, and o∣therwise: Wee doe hereby declare, that it is not Our meaning to change the course that hath been formerly held and vsed in finding Offices; nor to presse the raising or improouing of any values or Rates in any Inquisitions, other then as aforesaid: Neither will Wee haue the Rents which
shall bee reserued vpon such Leases, or any such Certificats, Informations or Instructi∣ons, as shall by any meanes be giuen or ap∣peare of the valewes of such Wards Lands or estates, to be transcribed, or transmitted to any other Court, Office, place or person; or admitted or vsed as President, euidence or inducement, to charge Our Subiects in any other payments now, or hereafter an∣swerable vnto Vs, Our Heires or Succes∣sors, or for any other cause. NEVERTHELES, Wee are well pleased and contented, that if any Wardship, Lease of Land, Meane rates before or after full age, now be, or hereafter shal be concealed from Vs, and no Suite shall be made with∣in three yeeres next after Our Tenants death, for such Wardship or Lease; that in such case the Master and Councell of the Court of Wards, openly in the Councel-chamber, as aforesaid, may admit any fit person whatsoeuer, that shall make offer to discouer Our right so concealed, or sought to be concealed and suppressed, vpon good matter or proofe, shewed for Vs and ap∣proued
by the Court, to prosecute the fin∣ding of an Office, and to passe the saide Wardship, lease or Meane rates, without re∣straining or binding the said Court, or the partie prosecuting, according to the Dire∣ctions aboue mentioned, but that the Ma∣ster and Councel of the said Court, may o∣penly in the councel-Chamber, as aforsaid, according to the parties trauaile, expenses, aduenture and seruice done vnto Vs, re∣ward him, by granting such Wardship, Lease, or Meane rates, in such sort as others may be encouraged to employ themselues in the like Seruice; And all deuices and practises to deceiue and defraud Vs of Our due and iust Right, be better preuented; Any thing in these our Instructions or Di∣rections to the contrary notwithstanding. PROVIDED alwayes, and Wee doe hereby declare it to be Our will and plea∣sure, that where it shall appeare to you, that neither Wee nor Our Progenitors, haue enioyed any benefit by Wardship, Liuery, Primer seisen, Reliefe, Respect of Ho∣mage, Fines or Meane Rates of any Lands
within the space of threescore yeeres last past, where such benefite ought to haue come to the Crowne, if such Tenure had bene acknowledged: In such cases We are pleased to giue power and authoritie to you Our Master and Councell of Our Court, openly in the councel-Chamber, as aforesaid, to remit and release all such Be∣nefit and profit, as haue or ought to haue accrued vnto Vs, or to Our Progenitors, by reason of any such Tenure, allowing to such persons as haue prosecuted in Our be∣halfe, such part thereof as shall seeme good in your discretion, not exceeding a thirde part of the whole, as the same shalbe found by inquisition; Sauing to Vs, Our Heires and Successours, the right and inheritance of Our Tenures; And sauing Our Preroga∣tiue, and the benefit and profit of such Tenures of Vs, or Our Progenitors, as doe expresly appeare by matter of Record; And also such as haue bene created, or o∣therwise come vnto Vs within the same time of threescore yeeres.
AND now that We haue so sufficiently directed you, as Wee make little doubt but you will bee carefull of Our profit in the execution of your places; So neuerthelesse, Wee let you know hereby, that seeing Our owne iudgement tells Vs, that there may fall into your considerations many cir∣cumstances, which must guide you in as∣sessing the Fines for the marriages of Our Wards, and Renting of their Lands; some arising either out of the broken estate of the deceased, want of prouision for his Wife, his great charge of children vnpro∣uided for, infirmitie or tendernesse of the Heire, vncertainty of the Title, or great∣nesse of incumbrance vpon the Land, so as some Heire, that may in respect of his de∣gree, blood, or liuing, in opinion of the world be iudged to deserue a greater Rent or Fine, then some other persons more ob∣scure may, yet in regard of the causes a∣boue mentioned, or some other of like sort, lesse fit to haue any greater charge laid vpon him: Wee doe therefore, notwith∣standing
any thing contained in these Our Instructions, giue you full libertie, that as these, or any other the like considerations, shall offer themselues vnto you, you may vse that good discretion and conscience which is fit, openly in the Councell cham∣ber, as aforesaid, in mittigating or abating the Fines or Rents vpon the said Grants or Leases, to the reliefe of such necessities; So alwayes as care be taken, that by any such pretenses, that profit which should accrue vnto Vs, be not diuerted to any others that shall seeke to drawe to themselues a priuate benefit out of this Our gracious care and consideration. And Our will and plea∣sure is, and Wee doe hereby direct and au∣thorise you the Master and Councell of the sayd Court, and the Master and Coun∣cell of the same for the time beeing, that with the aduice of Our Iudges, Assistants of Our sayd Court, you diligently exa∣mine, search out, and reforme all fraudu∣lent deuices and practises, deuised or to be deuised and put in vre, to deceiue and de∣feate
Vs of Our Wardships, or Leases of Our Wards Lands, or of any due or iust be∣nefit belonging vnto Vs, by reason of Our Tenures. AND lastly, that the Master of the Wardes, Surueyour, Attourney, Recei∣uer, Auditors, Clerke of the Court, and his Deputie, the Clerke of the Liueries and his Deputie, and all the Feodaries, and the Masters Secretarie, and all other Officers, and persons imployed in his Ma∣iesties Reuenue of the Wards, shall take an expresse oath, openly in the Councell chamber of the Court of Wardes, in man∣ner and forme following. I, A. B. doe sweare, that neither I, nor any other person for me by my appointment, knowledge or consent, shall take or receiue of any person, a∣ny gift or reward directly or indi∣rectly, for any Composition or pre∣ferment,
or causing any person or per∣sons to be preferred to compound be∣fore another, or to haue any mittiga∣tion in the price, or payment in any Composition or contract, at any time hereafter to bee made for the Ward∣ship of the bodie, or Lease of the Lands of any his Maiesties Wards, or for the custody of any his Maiesties Ideots, or Lunatikes, or their Lands, Goods or Chattels, or for the signing or dispatching of any Warrant for any Grant of them or any of them, excepting ordinary Fees: So helpe mee God. In witnesse where∣of Wee haue caused these Our Letters to bee made Patents. Witnesse Ourselfe at West∣minster
