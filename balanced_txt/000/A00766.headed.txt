¶Hereafter foloweth a mornynge remembraū∣ce had at the moneth mynde of the noble prynces Margarete countesse of Rychemonde & Darbye moder vnto kynge Henry the .vii. & grandame to oure souerayne lorde that nowe is vppon whose soule almyghty god haue mercy.
¶Dixit Martha ad Ihesum. THis holy gospell late red / conteyneth in it a dyalogue that is to saye a co∣mynycacyon betwyxt the woman of blessyd memory called Martha and our sauyour Ihesu / whiche dyalo∣gue I wolde applye vnto this noble prȳces late deceased / in whose remē¦braunce this offyce & obseruaūces be done at this ty∣me. And thre thynges by ye leue of god I wyll entende Fyrst to shewe wherin this noble prynces may wel be lykened & compared vnto ye blessyd woman Martha. Seconde how she may complayne vnto our sauyour Ihesu for ye paynfull dethe of her body / lyke as Mar∣tha dyde for ye dethe of her broder Lazarus. Thyrde ye confortable answer of our sauyour Ihesu vnto her a∣gayne. In the fyrst shall stonde her prayse & cōmenda¦cyon. In ye seconde our mornyng for ye losse of her. In the .iij. our confort agayne. Fyrst I saye yt the compa∣ryson of them two may be made in .iiij. thȳges. In no¦blenes of persone / in dyscyplyne of theyr bodyes / in or deryng of theyr soules to god / in hospytalites kepȳge & charitable dealing to their neybours. In whiche .iiii the noble woman Martha (as say ye doctours entrea∣tynge this gospell / & her lyfe) was syngulerly to be cō∣mended & praysed / wherfore let vs consyder lyke wise whether in this noble coūtesse may ony thyng lyke be foūde. Fyrst ye blessyd Martha was a woman of noble blode to whom by enheritaūce belonged ye castel of be∣thany / & this noblenes of blode they haue which descē¦ded of noble lygnage. Besyde this there is a noblenes
of maners / withouten whiche the noblenes of bloode is moche defaced / for as Boecius sayth. Yf oughte be good in the noblenes of bloode it is for that therby the noble men and women sholde be ashamed to go out of kynde from the vertuous maners of theyr auncetrye before. Yet also there is another noblenes / whiche ary¦seth in euery persone by the goodnes of nature / wher∣by full often suche as come of ryght pore and vunoble fader and moder / haue grete abletees of nature / to no¦ble dedes. Aboue all these same there is a foure ma∣ner of noblenes / whiche may be called an encreased no¦blenes / as by maryage and affynyte of more noble per¦sones suche as were of lesse condycyon maye encrease in hyer degre of noblenes. In euery of these I suppo∣se this coutesse was noble. Fyrst she came of noble blo∣de lyneally descendynge of kynge Edwarde the .iij. wt in the .iiij. degre of the same. Her fader was Johan du¦ke of Somerset her moder was called Margarete ry∣ghte noble as well in maneres as in bloode. To who∣me she was a veray doughter in all noble maners / for she was bounteous & lyberall to euery persone of her knowlege or aquayntaunce. Auaryce and couetyse she moost hated. And sorowed it ful moche in al persones But specyally in ony yt belonged vnto her. She was also of synguler casynes to be spoken vnto / & full cur∣tayse answere she wolde make to all yt came vnto her / Of meruayllous gentylnesse she was vnto all folkes / but specyally vnto her owne / whom she trusted and lo¦ued ryghte tenderly. Unkynde she wolde not be vnto no creature / ne forgetefull of ony kyndnes or seruyce done to her before / whiche is no lytel parte of veray no¦blenes. She was not vengeable / ne cruell / but redy a∣none
to forgete and to forgyue iniuries done vnto her at ye leest desyre or mocyon made vnto her for ye same. Mercyfull also & pyteous she was vnto suche as was greuyd & wrongfully troubled And to them yt were in pouerty or sekenes or ony other myserye. To god & to the chirche full obedyent & tractable serchynge his ho¦noure & pleasure full besyly. A warenes of herself she had alwaye to eschewe euery thynge yt myght dysho∣nest ony noble woman / or dystayne her honour in ony condycyon. Tryfelous thynges yt were lytell to be re∣garded she wolde let passe by / but the other yt were of weyght & substaūce wherin she myghte prouffyte she wolde not let for ony payne or laboure to take vppon hande. These & many other suche noble condycyons lefte vnto her by her auncetres she kepte & encreased them with a grete dylygens. The thyrde noblenes al∣so she wanted not whiche I sayd was ye noblenes of Nature / she had in maner all yt was praysable in a wo¦man eyther in soule or in body. Fyrst she was of singu¦ler wysedome ferre passynge ye comyn rate of women she was good in remembraūce & of holdyng memorye A redy wytte she had also to conceyue all thynges. Al∣beit they were ryght derke / right studyous she was in bokes whiche she hadde in grete nombre bothe in En∣glysshe & in Frensshe / & for her exercyse & for ye prouf∣fyte of other she dyde translate dyuers maters of de∣uocyon out of Frensshe in to Englysshe. Ful often she complayned yt in her youthe she had not gyuen her to ye vnderstondynge of latyn wherin she had a lytell per¦ceyuynge specyally of ye rubrysshe of ye ordynall for ye sayeng of her seruyce whiche she dyde wel vnderstan¦de. Here vnto in fauour / in wordes / in gesture / in eue¦ry
demeanour of herself so grete noblenes dyde appe¦re / yt what she spake or dyde it meruayllously became her. The .iiii. noblenes whiche we named a noblenes goten or encreased she had also. For albeit she of her ly¦nage were ryght noble / yet neuertheles by maryage / & adioynyng of other blode it toke some encreasement For in her tendre aege she beynge endued wt so grete towardnes of nature / & lyklyhode of enherytaūce ma¦ny sued to haue had her to maryage. The duke of suth folke whiche thā was a man of grete experyēce moost dylygently procured to haue had her for his sone and heyre. Of ye contrary parte kinge Henry ye .vi. dyd ma∣ke meanes for Edmonde his broder then therle of Ry∣chemōde. She whiche as then was not fully .ix. yeres olde / doutfull in her mynde what she were best to do asked counsayll of an olde gentylwoman whome she moche loued & trusted / whiche dyde aduyse her to cō∣mende herselfe to saynt Nycholas ye patron & helper of al true maydens / & to beseche him to put in her mȳ¦de what she were best to do. This coūsayl she folowed & made her prayer so full often / but specyally yt nyght whan she sholde ye morowe after make answer of her mynde determynatly. A meruaylous thing yt same ny¦ghte as I haue herde her tell many a tyme / as she lay in prayer callynge vpon saynt Nicholas / whether sle¦pynge or wakyng she coude not assure / but aboute .iiii of ye clocke in yt mornȳge one appered vnto her arayed like a bisshop / & naming vnto her Edmonde had take hȳ vnto her husbande. And so by this meane she dyde enclyne her mynde vnto Edmonde ye kinges broder & erle of Rychemonde. By whom she was made moder of ye kinge yt deed is / whose soule god {per}don / & granda∣me
to our souerayne lorde kyng Henry ye .viii. whiche now by ye grace of god gouerneth ye realme. So what by lygnage what by affinite she had .xxx. kinges & que¦nes within ye .iiii. degre of maryage vnto her. Besyde erles / markyses / dukes / and princes. And thus moche we haue spoken of her noblenes. SEconde ye blessyd Martha is praysed in chasty¦synge her body by crysten dyscyplyne / as in ab¦stynence / fastyng / sharpe clothes werynge / chastite wt other. Whiche thing albeit necessary to euery crysten persone wyllynge to be saued / yet it is moche more to be praysed in the nobles / hauyng this worldy lyberte As it was in this noble prynces late deceased whome my purpose is not vaynly to extol or to magnyfye abo¦ue her merytes / but to ye edefyenge of other by thexā¦ple of her. I wold reherce somwhat of her demeanȳg in this behalue / her sobre temperaūce in metes & dryn¦kes was knowen to al them yt were conuersaūt wt her wherin she lay in as grete wayte of herself as ony {per}so∣ne myght / kepinge alway her strayte mesure / & offen∣dyng as lytel as ony creature myght. Eschewȳge ban∣kettes / reresoupers / ioncryes betwyxe meales. As for fastynge for aege & feblenes albeit she were not boūde yet tho dayes yt by ye chirche were appoynted she kept them diligently & sereously / & in especyall ye holy lent thrugh out yt she restrayned her appetyte tyl one mele & tyl one fysshe on ye day / besyde her other peculer fas∣tes of deuocion / as saint Anthony / mary Maudeleyn saynt Katheryn wt other. And thorowe out al ye yere ye fryday & saterday she full truely obserued. As to har¦de clothes wering she had her shertes & gyrdyls of hee¦re / whiche whā she was in helth eueri weke she fayled
not certayne dayes to weare somtyme yt one / somty∣me yt other / yt full often her skynne as I herde her say was perced therwith. As for chastyte thoughe she al∣way contynued not in her vyrgynte yet in her husbā¦des dayes longe tyme before that he deyede she op∣teyned of hym lycence & promysed to lyue chast / in the handes of the reuerende fader my lorde of London / whiche promyse she renewed after her husbandes de∣the in to my handes agayne / wherby it may appere ye dyscyplyne of her body. THyrdly ye blessyd Martha is cōmended in orde¦rynge of her soule to god / by often knelynges / by sorowfull wepynges / & by contynual prayers & me¦dytacyons wherin this noble prynces somwhat toke her part. Fyrst in prayer euery daye at her vprysynge whiche comynly was not longe after .v. of ye clock she began certayne deuocyons / & so after theym wt one of her gentylwomen ye matynes of our lady / whiche kep¦te her to then she came in to her closet / where then wt her chapelayne she sayd also matyns of ye daye. And af¦ter yt dayly herde .iiij. or .v. masses vpon her knees / soo contynuynge in her prayers & deuocions vnto ye hour of dyner / whiche of ye etynge daye was .x. of ye clocke / & vpon ye fastynge day .xj. After dyner ful truely she wol¦de go her stacyons to thre aulters dayly. Dayly her dy¦ryges & cōmendacyons she wolde saye. And her euen∣songes before souper bothe of ye daye & of our lady / be∣syde many other prayers & psalters of Dauyd thrugh out ye yere. And at nyght before she wente to bedde she faylled not to resorte vnto her chapell / & there a large quart of an hour to occupye her in deuocyōs. No mer¦uayl though al this long tyme her knelȳge was to her
paynfull / and so paynfull that many tymes it caused in her backe payne and dysease. And yet neuertheles dayly whan she was in helth she faylled not to say the crowne of our lady whiche after the manere of Rome conteyneth .lx. and thre aues / and at euery aue to ma∣ke a knelynge. As for medytacyon she had dyuers bo∣kes in Frensshe wherwith she wolde occupy herselfe whan she was wery of prayer. Wherfore dyuers she dyde translate oute of Frensshe in to Englysshe. Her meruayllous wepynge they can bere wytnes of whi∣che here before haue herde her confessyon whiche be dyuers and many / & at many seasons in ye yere lyght∣ly euery thyrde daye / can also recorde the same tho ye were present at ony tyme / whā she was housylde whi¦che was ful nye a dosen tymes euery yere: what flodes of teeres there yssued forth of her eyes / she myght wel saye. Exitus aquarum deduxerūt oculi mei. And more ouer to thentente all her werkes myght be more acceptable and of gretter meryte in the syght of god suche godly thynges she wolde take by obedyence whiche obedyence she promysed to the fore named fa∣der my lorde of London for the tyme of his beynge wt her. And afterwarde in lyke wyse vnto me whereby it if may appere the dylygent ordre of her soule to god. FOurthe the holy Martha is magnyfyed for her godly hospytalyte and charytable dealynge to her neyghbours. Moche besynes there is in kepynge hospytalyte. And therfore oure lorde sayd vnto her. Martha martha solicita es & tbar{is} erga plri. The housholde seruaūtes muste be put in some good
ordre. The straungers of honeste whiche of theyr cur∣tesy resorteth for to vysyte the souerayne must be con¦sydered. And the suters / also whiche cometh compel∣led by necessyte to seche helpe & socoure in theyr cause muste be herde. And the poore & nedy / specyally wold be releued & conforted. Fyrst her owne houshold with meruayllous dylygence & wysdome this noble pryn∣ces ordred prouydynge reasonable statutes & ordynaū¦ces for them / whiche by her offycers she cōmaūded to be redde .iiij. tymes a yere. And oftentymes by herself she wolde soo louyngly courage euery of them to doo well. And somtyme by other meane persones. Yf ony faccyons or bendes were made secretely amongest her hede offycers / she wt grete polycye dyde boulte it oute and lyke wyse yf ony stryfe or contreuersy / she wolde wt grete dyscrecyon study the reformacyon therof. ¶For the straungers / o meruayllous god what payn what labour she of her veray gentylnes wolde take wt them to bere them maner and company / & intrete eue¦ry persone. And entertean them accordynge to theyr degre and hauour / & prouyde by her owne cōmaunde¦ment that nothynge sholde lacke yt myght be conueny¦ent for them / wherin she had a wonderfull redy remē∣braūce & perfyte knowlege. ¶For the suters / it is not vnknowen how studyously she procured Justyce to be admynystred by a long sea¦son so longe as she was suffred. And of her owne char¦ges prouyded men lerned for the same purpose euen∣ly & indyfferently to here all causes / and admynystre ryght and Justyce to euery party / whiche were in no small nombre. And yet mete and drynke was denyed to none of them.
¶For the poore creatures / albeit she dyd not receyue in to her house our sauyour in his owne persone as ye blessyd Martha dyde / she neuertheles receyued theim that dothe represent his persone. Of whome he sayth hymselfe Quod vni ex minimis meis fecistis michi fecistis. Poore folkes to ye nombre of .xij. she dayly and nyghtly kepte in her house / gyuynge them lodgyng / mete & drynke & clothynge / vysytyng them as often as she conuenyently myght. And in theyr sy∣kenes vysytynge them & confortynge them / & mynys∣trynge vnto them with her owne handes. And whan it pleased god to call ony of them out of this wretched worlde she wolde be presente to se theym departe and to lerne to deye. And lyke wyse brynge them vnto the erthe / whiche as Bonauēture affermeth is of gretter meryte than yf she had done all this to the selfe perso∣ne of our sauyour Ihesu. And ye other seruaūtes and mynystres of our lorde. Whom she herde were of ony deuocyon & vertue ful glad she was at al tymes whan she myght gete theym to whome she wolde lyke wyse shewe the comforte yt she coude. Suppose not ye that yf she myghte haue goten our sauyoure Ihesu in his owne persone / but she wolde as desyrously and as fer¦uently haue mynystred vnto hym as euer dyde Mar∣tha / whan thus moche she dyde vntyll his seruaūtes for his sake. ¶Thus it maye appere some comparison of ye blessid Martha & of this noble prynces whiche was the fyrst promysed. FOr the seconde that is to saye for the complay∣nynge & lamentacyon yt the soule of this noble prynces myghte make for the dethe of her only body.
It is to be consydered that oftentymes in scrypture ye vertuous and holy faders maketh lamentable excla∣macyons agaynste almyghty god / for that he semeth to be more indulgent and fauourable vnto ye wycked persone then vnto the good lyuer. The prophete Da∣uyd sayth in this maner. zelaui super iniquos: pa cem pctō{rum} videns. Quia non est respectus morti eorum nec firmamentū ī plaga eorū. That is to saye it perceth my stomacke to se the rest & case that synners often haue It is not loked for ye deth of them / nor none abydynge stroke or punysshemente falleth vpon them. The prophete Iheremy sayth also complaynynge vpon god. Quare via impiorum prosperatur bene est oībus qui preuaricātur et inique agunt. Why dothe the wycked persones prospere in theyr way. wele it is with al them that bre¦ke the lawes / and do wyckedly. The prophet Abacuc sayth lyke wyse cryenge vpon god. Quare respitis contemptores et taces conculante nupio iu∣stiorem se. why lokest thou fauourably vpon them yt dyspyse the. And suffrest a synner to bere downe him that is more ryghtwyse than he is. And the holy-man Job. Quare ergo īpii viuūt subleuati sūt con¦fortati qm diuitiis. why then be the wycked perso∣nes suffered for to lyue. They be set alofte / and they be comforted with rychesse. ¶The reason that moueth them thus to murmure & complayne may be this. There is in almyghty god .ij. vertues specyally commended & magnyfyed thorowe out al scrypture. That is to say mercy & ryghtwysnes
And bothe these sholde moue hym rather to be fauou¦rable vnto the good than vnto ye badde. Fyrst his mer¦cy sholde moue him therto haue pyte and compassyon where is the gretter cause of pyte but the greuaunce trouble and vexacyon of the good persone hath gret∣ter cause of pyte and is moche more pyteous than of the euyll persone. wherfore it may be thought that al∣myghty god whiche of his owne proprety is mercyful and redy to gyue mercy. Deus cui proprium est misereri. He sholde rather shewe his mercy vpon ye good than vpon the badde. And here vnto his ryght∣wysnes also sholde enclyne hym / for of his ryghtwys¦nes he sholde gyue vnto euery persone accordynge to his deserte. But the good deserueth rather by theyr goodnes to haue fauoure shewed vnto them then the badde. Wherfore the holy faders seynge in this world the wycked in prosperyte And the good in trouble & aduersite make these complayntes and exclamacions aboue rehersed agaynst almyghty god and some crye vpon hym as though he were a slepe. Exurge qua re obdormis domine. Some other threpe yt he ha¦the forgoten theym. Quare obliuisseris in opie nostre / & tribulationis nostre. Some thȳke the¦re is noo god at all. Dixit incipiens in corde suo non est deus. Some weneth at ye leest he is absente & asketh where he is. Ubi est deustuus. In thys condycion was ye blessyd woman Martha. She knew that our sauyour Ihesu was so good and mercyfull / And shewed his goodnes generally to al persones / she byleued faythfully that yf he had be present at ye dethe
of Lazarus her brother whom for his goodnes he lo∣ued so moche he wolde not haue suffred hym to deye. And therfore she sayd vnto hȳ. Domine si fuisses hic frater meus nō fuisset mortuus. That is to saye Syr yf thou had ben presente my brother had not ben deed. And in lyke maner ye soule of this noble prȳces whiche had ye body adioyned vnto it in fauour & loue as syster & brother it myght complayne for the dethe of ye body / syth euery parte of yt same body had ben so occupyed in the seruyce of god before. Her eyes in wepynges & teares somtyme of deuocion somtyme of repentaunce / hereares herynge the worde of god & the dyuyne seruyce whiche dayly was kept in her cha¦pell wt grete nombre of preestes / clerkes and chyldren to her grete charge & cost / her tongue occupyed in pra¦yer moche parte of the daye / her legges and fete in vy¦sytynge the aulters and other holy places goynge her stacyons customably whan she were not let / her han∣des in gyuynge almes vnto the poore and nedye / and dressynge them also whan they were syke and mynys∣trynge vnto them mete and drynke. These mercyfull and lyberall handes to endure the moost paynful crā∣pes soo greuously vexynge her and compellynge her to crye. O blessyd Ihesu helpe me. O blessyd lady so∣coure me. It was a mater of grete pyte / lyke a spere it perced ye hertes of all her true seruaūtes yt was abou∣te her & made theym crye also of Ihesu for helpe & so∣coure wt grete haboundaūce of teares. But specyally whan they sawe ye dethe so hast vpon her and that she must nedes departe from them / and they sholde forgo so gentyll a maystrts / so tender a lady then wept they
meruayllously / wepte her ladyes and kynnes women to whom she was full kynde / wepte her poore gentyl∣women whom she had loued so tenderly before / wept her chamberers to whome she was full deare / wepte her chapelaynes and preestes / wepte her other true & faythfull seruauntes. And who wolde not haue wept that there had ben presente. All Englonde for her de∣the had cause of wepynge. The poore creatures yt we∣re wonte to receyue her almes / to whome she was al∣waye pyteous and mercyfull. The studyentes of bo∣the the vnyuersytees to whome she was as a moder. All the lerned men of Englonde to whome she was a veray patronesse. All the vertuous and deuoute perso¦nes to whō she was as a louȳge syster / all ye good rely¦gyous men and women whom she so often was wont to vysyte and comforte. All good preestes and clerkes to whome she was a true defenderesse. All the noble men and women to whome she was a myrroure and exampler of honoure. All ye comyn people of this real¦me for whom she was in theyr causes a comyn media¦tryce / and toke ryght grete dyspleasure for them / and generally the hole realme hathe cause to complayne & to morne her dethe. And all we consyderynge her gra¦cyous and charytable mynde. So vnyuersally & con∣syderynge the redynes of mercy and pyte in our sauy¦our Ihesu may saye by lamentable complaynt of our vnwysdome vnto him. Ah domine si fuisses hic Ah my lorde yf thou hadde ben present and had herde this sorowfull cryes of her thy seruaunte with the o∣ther lamentable mornȳges of her frendes & seruaūtes thou for thy goodnes wold not haue suffred her to dye
But thou wolde haue take pyte and compassyon vpō her. It foloweth in the gospell by the mouthe of Mar¦tha. Sed et nunc scio quia quecū{que} poposce∣ris a deo dabit tibi deus. That is to saye what so euer thou wylt aske of god thy fader I knowe wel he wyll graunte it vnto the. who may doubte but ye so∣ne of god of whome saynt Poule sayth. In diebus carnis sue preces et supplicationes / offerens exauditus est pro sua reuerētia. That is to saye in the dayes of his mortalite whan he was mortall he¦re in erthe yet neuertheles he was herde of almyghtye god in his prayer and askynge / his fader for his reue¦rente behauoure. Who may doubte but moche rather now he shall be herde whan he is in soo gloryous ma∣ner aboue in heuen. And there presente before the face of his fader for our cause as sayeth saynt Paule. In troiuit ipse celum vt appareat vultui dei {pro} nobis. He hathe entred the heuen to appere before ye vysage of his fader for vs / to shewe the woundes whi¦che he dyde suffre for the delyueraunce of vs from syn Yf in his mortall body he prayed & asked forgyuenes for his enmyes that crucefyed him and cruelly put hȳ vnto the dethe. And yet neuertheles he opteyned hys petycyon for them. Moche rather it is to suppose that he shal opteyne his askynge her that had so often com¦passyon of his blessyd passyon / and dyd bere it so often in her remembraunce as dyd this noble prynces. Thā for his mortal enmyes whiche were many and but vy¦laynes / he prayed vndesyred of only / he let not so to do by ye greuous paynes of dethe whiche he there suffred Nowe therfore he beyng in so grete glorye aboue and
at all lyberte. Yf all we call & crye vpon hym prayer for this one soule of this moost noble prynces whiche was his faythfull & true seruaunt. Who maye thynke but yt he for his infynyte goodnes wyll haue mercye there vpon. We wyll not craue vpon him yt he shal res¦tore the body agayne to lyfe / as he dyde the body of la¦zarus / we muste be contente wt the dethe of it / & lerne therby to prepayre our owne bodyes to ye same poynt within shorte tyme. But we shall wt moost entyer min¦des beseche hym to accepte yt swete soule to his grete mercy to be parteyner of yt euerlastynge lyfe wt hym & wt his blessyd sayntes aboue in heuen / whiche I pray you al nowe affectually to praye / & for her now at this tyme moost deuoutly to say one Pater noster. FYrst ye haue herde ye goodly condicyons of this noble prynces whome we dyde resemble vnto the blessyd woman Martha. Ye haue herde also in the ij. place a pyteous complaynt of the parte of her soule for the dethe of her body made vnto our sauyour Ihū Nowe wyll I rememembre ye comfortable answer of our mercyfull sauyoure agayne vnto her wherof we all may be gretely comforted & take cause & matere of grete reioysynge. It foloweth in the gospell. Dixit ei iesus resurget frater tuus. That is to saye in Englysshe. Ihesu sayd vnto her / thy broder shal ryse agayne. I said before that consyderynge the loue and amyte that is betwyxe the soule & the body they maye be thought to be as broder and syster. A trouthe it is the soules that be hens departed out of theyr bodyes /
haue neuertheles a natural desyre and appetyte to be knytte & ioyned wt them agayne / whiche thinge not o∣nely the theologyens wytnesse / but ye phylosophers al¦so. A grete comforte then it is vnto the soule yt hath so longynge desyre vnto the body to here yt the body shal ryse agayne. And specyally in yt maner & forme of ry∣synge / wherof saynt Poule speketh in this wyse. Se minat in corruptione: surget in incorruptio¦ne. Seīatur in ignobilitate: surget in gloria. Seīatur ī infirmitate: surget in vtute. Seīa tur corpus aīale surget corpus spūale. Foure condycyons ye body hathe whan it dyeth & is put in to the groūde. Fyrst it anone begynneth to putrefye & re¦solue in to foule corrupcyon. The ayre dothe alter it: the grounde dothe moyste it / the wormes dothe brede of it & fede also. Seconde it is vyle & lothely to behold & ryght vngoodly to ye syght. Thyrde it is vnweldy / & not of power to styre itself or to be conuayed from pla∣ce to place. Fourth it is so grosse yt it occupyeth a row me & kepeth a place & letteth other bodyes to be presēt in ye same place. Agaynst these four ye bodyes of them yt shall be saued shall take at theyr rysynge agayne .iiij other excellent gyftes. Agaynst ye fyrste it shall be in yt condicion yt neyther ye ayre / ne ye water / ne fyre / ne kni¦fe / nor wepen nor stroke / nor sekenes shall anoye it. Agaynst ye .ij. it shall ryse bryght & gloryous and in ye moost goodly & beauteous manere. Agaynst ye thyrde it shall be more nymble & more redy to be conuayed to ony place where ye soule wolde haue it then is ony swa¦lowe. Agaynst the .iiij. it shall be subtyle yt it shall per¦ce thorowe the stone walles without ony anoyaūce of
them. This shall be a farre dyfference & a grete dyuer¦syte of her body as she had it before / and as she shall in conclusyon receyue it agayne. But yet me thinke I se what the soule of this noble pryncesse may answere agayne somwhat to lesse & to mynysshe this dysconfort after the same maner that Martha dyde answere vn¦to our sauyour Ihesu. Scio {quod} resurget in resur¦rectione in nouissimo die. That is to say I kno¦we well yt it shall ryse agayne in the laste daye of ye ge¦neral resurreccyon / but yt is farre hens / that is long to come. Et spes que diffentur affligit animam. And the hope of a thynge delayed tormenteth ye soule in the meane tyme. Therfore our sauyour more com∣fortable answereth to her agayne & sayth in this ma∣ner. Ego sum resurrectio & vita. That is. I am sayth he the veray cause of raysynge of the body. And I am also the veraye cause of lyfe vnto the soule. As who saye tho the rysynge of the body be delayed for a season / the soule neuertheles shal for the meane tyme haue a pleasaunt & a swete lyfe. A lyfe full of comfort a lyfe full of ioye & pleasure / a lyfe voyde of all sorow & encombraūce / a lyf not lyke vnto ye lyfe of this wret¦ched world whiche is alway entermelled wt moche bit¦ternes / eyther with sorowes / eyther wt dredes or elles with perylles. In hoc mundo non dolere nō ti∣mere non periclitari impossibile est. Sayeth saynt Austyn. It is impossyble to lyue in this worlde & not to sorowe / not to drede / not to be in peryl. This same noble prynces yf she had contynued in this worl¦de she sholde dayly haue herde & sene mater & cause of sorowe as well in herselfe as in her frendes parauen∣ture.
Her body dayly sholde haue waxen more unwel∣dy / her syght sholde haue be derked / and her herynge sholde haue dulled more and more / her legges sholde haue faylled her by & by. And all the other partyes of her body waxe more crased euery daye / whiche thyn∣ges sholde haue ben mater to her of grete dyscomforte And albeit these thinges had not fallen vnto her forth with / yet she sholde haue lyued alwaye in a drede and a fere of them. Dare I say of her she neuer yet was in that prosperyte but the gretter it was ye more alwaye she dredde the aduersyte. For whan the kynge her so∣ne was crowned in all yt grete tryumphe & glorye / she wepte meruayllously. And lyke wyse at the grete try∣umphe of the maryage of prynce Arthur. And at the laste coronacyon wherin she had full grete Joye / she let not to saye yt some aduersyte wolde folowe / so that eyther she was in sorowe by reason of the present ad∣uersytes / or elles whan she was in prosperite she was in drede of ye aduersyte for to come. I passe ouer ye pe∣rylles & daungers innumerable whiche dayly & hour∣ly myght haue happed vnto her wherof this lyf is ful And therfore saynt Gregory sayth. Uita hec terre∣na eterne vite comparata mors est potius di cenda quam vita. And for that cause who yt ones hathe tasted the pleasures of yt lyfe / this is vnto them a veray dethe for euer after. Example of Lazar{us} whi∣che after yt he was restored to ye myseryes of this lyfe agayne / he neuer lough but was in contynuall heuy∣nes and pensyfnesse. Now therfore wolde I aske you this one questyon. Were it not suppose ye al this consi¦derd a meetly thȳg for vs to desyre to haue this noble princes here amōgest vs agayn to forgo ye ioyous lyfe
aboue to wante ye presence of ye gloryous trynyte whō she so longe hathe sought & honoured to leue yt moost noble kyngdome to be absent frome the moost blessyd company of sayntes & sayntesses & hether to come a∣gayn to be wrapped & endaūgered with ye mysteres of this wretched worlde / wt the paynfull dyseases of her aege / wt the other encomberaunces yt dayly happethe in this myserable lyfe. Were this a reasonable request of oure partye / were this a kynde desyre / were this a gentyl wysshel yt where she hathe ben so kinde & louȳg a maystresse vnto vs / all we sholde more regarde our owne prouffytes then her more synguler wele & com∣forte. The moder yt hathe so grete affeccyon vnto her sone yt she wyll not suffre hym to departe from her to his promocyon & furtheraūce but alway kepe hym at home / more regardynge her owne pleasure than hys wele / were not she an vnkinde & vngentyl moder / yes verayly / let vs therfore thȳke our moost louyng mays∣tres is gone hens for her promocyon / for her grete fur¦theraunce / for her moost wele & prouffyte. And herin comforte vs / herin reioyse ourselfe & thanke almygh∣ty god whiche of his infynyte mercy so gracyously ha¦the dysposed for her. But ye wyll say vnto me. Syr yf yf We were sure of this we wolde not be sory / but be ryght hertly glad & ioyous therfor As for suerte veray suerte can not be had but only by ye reuelacyon of god almighty. Neuertheles as farre as by scrypture / this thȳge can be assured in thende of this gospel folowing¦ly iz made by our sauyour a stronge argument almost demōstratyue of this same thynge / ye argumēt is this. Euery persone yt putteth theyr full truste in cryst Ihū
Albeit they be deed in theyr bodyes yet shall they ne∣uertheles haue lyfe in theyr soules / & that lyf yt neuer shall haue ende. But this noble prynces she put her ful truste in cryste▪ Ihesu verayly byleuynge that he was the sone of god & came in to this worlde for ye redemp¦cyon of synners / wherfore it must necessaryly folowe yt albeit her body be deed her soule is in yt ioyous lyfe yt neuer shall cease. The fyrste parte of this argument foloweth in ye gospell. Qui credit in me etiam si¦mortuus fuerit viuet. That is to say who yt fully trusteth in cryst Ihū / albeit they be deed in theyr bodi¦es / they neuertheles shal lyue in theyr soules. But yet we wante a lytell I sayd more than this. I saw yt lyfe shall neuer haue ende / & for this also it foloweth. Et oēs {qui} viuit & credit ī me nō moriet ineternū. That is to saye euery persone yt hathe this lyfe & this full trust in Ihesu shall neuer dye. So here appereth well yt fyrst parte of our argument. For ye .ij. part now yt this noble prynces had full fayth in Ihesu cryste it may appere yf ony wyll demaūde this questyon of her yt our sauyour demaūded of Martha / he sayd to her / Credis hoc. Byleuist yu this? what is yt / that this gē¦tylwoman wolde not byleue / she yt ordeyned .ij. conty∣nual reders in bothe ye vnyuersytes to teche ye holy dy¦uynyte of Ihesu / she yt ordeyned prechers perpetuall to publysshe yt doctryne & fayth of cryste Ihesu / she yt buylded a college royall to ye honour of ye name of crist Ihesu / & lefte tyll her executours another tobe buyl∣ded to mayntayn his fayth & doctryne. Besyde al this foūded in ye monastery of westmynster where her bo∣dy lyeth thre prestes to praye for her perpetually. She
whom I haue many tymes herde saye yt yf ye crysten prynces wolde haue warred vpon the enmyes of his faith she wold be glad yet to go folowe ye hoost & helpe to wasshe theyr clothes for ye loue of Ihū / she yt openly dyde wytnesse this same thynge at ye houre of her de∣the / whiche saynge dyuers here presente can recorde how hertly she answered whan ye holy sacrament con¦taynȳge ye blessid Ihū in it was holden before her / & ye questyon made vntyl her whether she byleued yt there was verayly ye sone of god yt suffred his blessyd passyō for her & for all mankynde vpon ye crosse. Many here can bere recorde how wt all her herte & soule she raysed her body to make answere there vnto / & confessed as∣suredly yt in yt sacrament was conteyned cryst Ihesu ye sone of god yt dyed for wretched sȳners vpon ye crosse in whom holly she put her truste & confydence / these same wordes almoost yt Martha confessed in the ende of this gospell. Ego credidi quia tu es christus filius dei qui ī mūdū venisti. That is to saye I haue byleued yt thou art cryst ye sone of gad whiche ca¦me in to this worlde. And so sone after yt she was ane∣led she departed & yelded vp her spyryte in to ye handes of our lorde / who may not nowe take euydent lyklyho¦de & coniecture vpon this yt the soule of this noble wo¦man whiche so studyously in her lyf was occupyed in good werkes / & with a faste fayth of cryst / & the sacra¦mentes of his chirche was defended in yt houre of de∣partynge out from ye body was borne vp in to ye coun∣tre aboue wt ye blessyd aūgelles deputed & ordeyned to yt holy mystery. For yf ye herty prayer of many {per}sones Yf her owne contynuall prayer in her lyf tyme. yf ye sa¦cramētes of ye chirche orderly taken. yf indulgences &
pardons graūted by diuers popes / yf true repentaūce & teeres / yf fayth & deuocyon in criste Ihesu / yf chary¦te to her neyghbours / yf pyte vpon ye poore / yf forgy∣uenes of iniuries / or yf good werkes be auaylable / as doubtles they be / grete lyklyhode & almoost certayne coniecture we may take by them / & all these yt soo it is in dede. Therfore put we asyde all wepynge & teeres / & be not sad ne heuy as men withouten hope / but ra∣ther be we gladde & ioyous / & eche of vs herin conort other. Alwaye praysynge & magnyfyenge the name of oure lorde / to whome be laude and honoure endlesly Amen. ¶Thus endeth this lamentable mornynge.
