A true, exact, and perfect Relation of the fa∣mous and renowned Victorie, gained by the most redoubted Armie of the migh∣tie and victorious Monarch PHILIP, of that name the fourth King of Spaine, &c. the seventh of September, being upon the Eve of the Nativitie of our Lady: Against the forces of LEVVIS, of that name the 13. French King, then straightly beleague∣ring both with Navall and Land Powers the frontier Citie of FUENTERAVIA. WHich Citie, by the said overthrow of the French was happily succou∣red and relieved: And that this Relation may beare the greater colour of truth, and gaine the greater beliefe in the imaginati∣ons of men: it is not amisse (by the way) to intimate, that it is no partiall Gazet, or Slanderous tale or Ballad, which upon such occasi∣ons are ever prompt to be taken hold of, in the
wavering conceipts of the giddy multitude. But it is the reall knowledge, and painfull, and dangerous experience of one that was Actor in that Tragi-Co∣medy, as he can shew good materialls for. But my desire (who am bold to terme my selfe the Relator of this exployt) is not to name my selfe, but to warrant the certainty of this true Pamphlet: And to pro∣ceed. The said Citie of Fuenteravia, being (according as the naturall scituation thereof could afford conve∣niencie of in incamping and lying in road to the Be∣siegers) beleagured both by sea and land, and all pas∣sages, accesse, and conveyances of succour or relief to the besieged, shut up and strongly barred with sun∣drie many Trenches, Redouts, Cortadura's, Barriers, and all sorts of Millitarie lets, and engines to hinder and prevent any designes of the feared (by them) Spanish powers: So that onely excepted, the care of the Almighty of his servants, there remained no manner of hope of any earthly helpe to the besieged. But as it is seene by dayly experience, that where a∣ny manly courage, or valorous Roman resolution is inhabiting, that there it begins to shew it selfe most, where its help is most requisite and available. So now the undaunted and couragious Spaniards, though little in number, by reason of their daily losses, ef∣fected by the over-greedy desire of glorie, and gay∣ning of the Fort of their adversaries, and by their high resolution on the other side to withstand their enemies intent. The Alcald, or Governour of the Towne, seeing to what a streight they were brought, by this hard pounding of them up by their enemies,
like a discreet and carefull overseer of his taske, labo∣rious, and sedulous Pastor of his intrusted flock: hee began in time (seeing this cloud of Warre hanging over his head, and thereupon a great tempest of Armes threatned to prevent this storme therefore, and to seek shelter afore the said storme for himselfe, and the rest of his warre, and weather-beaten compa∣ny, being as aforesaid daily diminished, and the ene∣mies on the other side everie day more and more in∣creasing, still by new fresh and daily reliefes and suc∣cors from their neighbour home, to their great com∣fort and encouragement. The Alcald, as is said, per∣ceiving things as they stood, with all speed assembled the prime of his retinue, and told them the state of the businesse as it stood in his conceit, which accor∣dingly was conceived of by the most understanding of them, to be as he conceived: whereupon by general consent of all the Commanders then there, a speedy advertisement of all the severall particularities tou∣ching the state of the Towne, the besiegers and the distressed, (if not out of hand relieved) besieged, was dispatched to his Catholike Majesty, which dispatch was sundry and verie oftentimes confirmed, by the comming still of new advertisements and solicitati∣ons of present succours both to his said sacred Maje∣stie of Spaine, and to the Almirant of Castile, a man of a most ancient and noble familie, eminent in the Common-wealth by his well-deserved office, and in his nature and vertuous qualities, not easily paral∣lel'd, but scarcely imitable: And to conclude, though not with the twentieth part of his goodnes; yet in few words to comprehend much, a man that
in spight of envie (be it spoken) may deservedly be termed, the Mirrour of compleat Nobilitie, magna∣nimity, and courage, and a true delineated patterne, and effigies of all those rare parts which ought to bee comprehended in a true-hearted Noble-man, great states man, grave Councellour, and warlike director of a Common-wealth as he was then, being high Ge∣nerall of the Spanish Armie: who having received these severall advertisements, therein plainly manife∣sted to the world his honest heart, cleare conscience, loving nature, and stout resolution, by commiserating like a good Patriot, the hard case of his afflicted coun∣try-men; for presently and out of hand hee called a Councell of warre, of the best and most approved Leaders in his armie, representing unto them the grievances and request of the Governour, and his Garrison, commanding them, that after serious con∣sultation thereof had that night: that the next mor∣ning, they should render him an account of their re∣solution therin, for the best prevention of the enemies designes, and most convenient meanes of succouring their dangerously engaged friends. But by reason of the scarsity of experienced old souldiers there was a cōfused diversitie of opinions touching the matter in question among them, for lack, as is said, of fit expe∣rienced persons or instruments in that case, either for offence or defence. But at length considering that much profitable time for the purpose, may bee spent in little available discussions, and also timely conside∣ring the impossibilitie of any resistance left to the de∣fendants, against so great, and so resolutely bent for∣ces as were the French against them. This Chaos of
confused opinions was broke in sunder, and all im∣profitable matters therein set aside, leaving nothing behind, but the pure reall substance of the necessarie present helpe: whereof was framed a a setled and ge∣nerally agreed upon resolution: which was to send a∣way three Spanish Captaines, and foure Irish, which Irish Captaines were Daniel o Cahan, David Barrie, Oliver fitz Gerald, and Captaine Terentio o Gallig∣howe, and with the Auidante Pedro Geraldine, they went on with a crew of brave and stout stomackt men, resolved, rather than that they should faile of succouring their friends in their extremitie to make their enemies dig up their graves, and them accor∣ding to the heathen custome, to sprinkle with the blod of their said enemies, and so to offer a humane sacrifice for the expiation of their offences on earth: But as God would have it, there was no such need; for without let or molestation, they entred into the endangered Citie with desired, and long expected succour, to the extream joy and hearty comfort of the besieged. The Irish Captains with their Auidants and Com∣panies, were no sooner inclosed within the narrow precinct of the Citie walls, but that like fire, being removed from a vast and large place, where its exha∣lations had free scope of passing through the aire whereby the heat is not so forceable, nor extreame, as it is when the fire is removed into a narrow or straight room or compasse, where those fierie bodies are restrained of their former libertie, and are kept within the fire, whereby the heat of the fire is increa∣sed, by reason of the restraint of the said fierie bodies:
Even so the couragious and valiant Irish, being but a small handfull of men, in respect of their numerous e∣nemies, being in the broad fields, though they lac∣ked no courage or will to set upon their enemies: Yet were they not so fierie, nor so incensed, yet be∣ing ignorant of the poor case their friends and Com∣rades were in within the Towne▪ but comming in, and seeing in what state things stood there, then took they and kept to themselves all their unmercifull and raging bloody humours, and restrained them of their former liberties, which they had in the vast fields of their ignorance of their friends ill-fare, and sought license presently to execute their angry mood upon their insulting enemies, pretending that their haughtie and stout stomacks could not brooke nor disgest their enemies so neare neighbourhood. Whereupon license upon great and importunate en∣treatie being granted by the Governor, the Spaniards and the Irish began to give order for the sally, and began to encourage their souldiers, and to whet and set their lusty and lofty resolutions on edge in put∣ting them in mind of their former famous acts. Now all things being in order for the sally, by the incorpo∣rating and Marshalling of the Companies as the nar∣rownesse of the place could afford meanes to doe: this being done, they issued bravely on the suddaine, with such furie and eagernesse to fight, as if it had been a mountaines flood, which beares, and forcibly carries afore it, men and beasts, trees and stones, by the force of the riotous Current: Even so went on these brave Warriers, till they fell upon the enemies trench, where they did bloody execution and revenge upon
enemies, with some losse to themselves; in which skirmish, and many more hot and bloody encoun∣ters and conflicts I leave to the judicious French, the censure of the courage, and Lion-like magnani∣mitie and resolution of the brave and Heroick Irish men, in their bold and Chivalrous attempts, to the no small glorie of their most renowned King and Countrie; and not onely in that place, but also in se∣verall other places where their memorable and never dying acts are to their immortall fame, and reputati∣on registred and remaine as examples and patterns to noble and honour-thirsty minds, and stirring knight∣ly motives to posteritie, as namely, in Polonia, Germa∣nie, Flanders, and Spain. Almirante de Castilla, the thrice noble, and brave worthy afore-mentioned, prime Generall of the Spa∣nish Armies, after his arrivall at St. Sebastian, hee di∣spatched like a prudent Chiefetaine many spies to dis∣cover the passages, sallidas, fortifications, the number of their enemies watches, with the order of the same, and their vigilancie in setting their watches, with all the possible advantages that might be had of their said watches, fortifications, and strongest workes, as also to discover the state of the besieged: of which being advertised by the Governour, and of the dan∣ger they were in, if not presently succoured, as also the great forwardnesse of their enemies proceedings, if not speedily interrupted. Vpon which notice the Almirant resolved out of hand to attempt the re∣lieving of the Citie both by sea and land, which his brave intent, as God would have it, happily tooke desired effect, twice by the arrivall of Spanish
and Irish succours to the beleaguered: Notwithstan∣ding all these succours arrived in the Towne, and the flying rumours daily of the Spaniards maine armies approach, the French obstinately bent, either to take the towne, or to lose themselves in the pursuit there∣of, daily made their approaches with Trenches, Gal∣leries, and other warlike ground-works, and so well plyed themselves to the Spade and Mattock, that in short time they came to the Towne ditch and wall, and there blew up their Mines in three severall places: by meanes whereof, the walls on that side were so sore shaken and broken, that they were even levelled with the earth: so that by this, and the daily skirmi∣shes, and continuall alarums given to them of the Towne by the enemies keeping them still awake, by their multitudes, whereas the beleaguered had but few hands, so that they could not change, but that the same men were still upon the Wals, by which, and the terrible roaring of the French Canon, freely bestow∣ing its murthering bullets amongst the unthankfull, but not ungratefull besieged receivers: the one halfe almost of the besieged were slaughtered, and the rest sore wounded, and tired quite with continual watch∣ings and allarums: but in this extremitie the noble Matrons and yong maidens of the Citie, mightily re∣vived the drooping (for want of strength, not of courage) souldiers; for still they would be at hand with powder, Bullets, Guns, swords, Pikes; meat and drinke to the hungrie and thirsty, cure to the woun∣ded, and their hands were as forward in the ground∣workes, and Counterscarfes of the Citie, as any soul∣diers in the Garrison, and those that were hurt they
carryed home to their houses, and there cherished them, and cured them as if they had been their owne Fathers, or Husbands, or Brethren: which Amazo∣nian behaviour and resolution so animated the aba∣ted strengths, and tyred vigorous spirits of the un∣daunted Spaniards, and Irish, that even then as they thought (being in the jawes of death) being sure they should be slain, for yeeld they would not to save a thousand lives to each one; so carefull were they of their honour, and the reputation of their nation. E∣ven then, I say, being in this extremitie, they reassu∣med to themselves new courages, and out of a meer debilitie, and forced weaknesse, they squeezed to themselves new strength and couragious resolution: for it is knowne by tryed experience, ever since it is knowne what man and woman are, what power the force of love of the one Sex hath, to kindle in the ge∣nerous breast of the other, an invincible minde and boldnesse, of which, Ages, and Authors, both ancient and moderne afford multiplicitie of presidents and examples, which more fully to expresse is not my pre∣sent intent: but my purpose is to declare, according to my conscience, and experience in that warre to set forth fully, and not defraud either side of their wor∣thily atchieved glories: for by the womens incoura∣ging, and rowsing up of (the almost dejected strengths of) the Garrison souldiers, the reanima∣ted Spaniards and Irish were so dreadfull to their be∣sieging enemies, that they durst no more approach them than raging & hungrie mawed Lions. Yet not∣withstanding this, as is said, by the continuall bloody broyles, and toylsome labours, halfe the souldiers
beleaguer'd were slain, and many more of the French, and on both sides great numbers of Crepples, and maimed limlesse men escaped to preserve the memo∣rie of these cruell frayes of Mars, by the direfull los∣ses, and borne, and accompanying examples of their mangled members. The Prince de Conde, Generall of the most Chri∣stian Kings Armie, imagining wisely with the rest of the Councell of warre, by the great losse sustained by those of the Towne: and also by the breaking down of their walls by his Mines, as is afore related, that then hee may build a firme ground of giving an as∣sault to the Towne, upon those great advantages he supposed himselfe to have over those of the Towne, for their lack aswell of men, as of defensible Walls. As also by the great numbers on the other side he was himself furnished of, of valiant & brave French Cava∣liers, and all kinde of warlike Engines for to distresse the besieged. Vpon which sure foundations setling himselfe for to give the assault, hee presently gave command, which was accordingly worthily execu∣ted by the resolute French men, on the right hand of the breach, where they proceeded with such heat, fu∣rie, and valour, as if everie one of them carryed light∣ning in their armes and weapons, till they were con∣fronted upon the ruines of the decayed and battered walls, by the valorous Spanish and Irish souldiers, where both parties proceeded one against another. Just like as in a stormie and tempestuous day, the troubled and raging waves of the shipwrack threat∣ning sea, we see doe run with conjoyned and strongly
knitted force, intending to carrie all before them, minding no resistance, but on the suddaine we see they are met by the maine and impenetrable front of some high reared stonie Cliffe, where contrarie to their presumptuous and over-weening expectations, all their hopes are dashed, and their powers dis-joyn∣ted and beaten back in dismembred parcells into the maine bodie of their insulting seconding mother. Even so were the fierie stomacks of the hasty French cooled and quenched by the pure and precious wa∣ters of the unconquerable Spanish and Irish courages, and given repulses: where the French, after their forced retire, in memorie of their valour, left the breach full of their dead carkasses. The French Commanders seeing no hope, or any possibilitie of carrying the place by force of assault, propounded to the besieged certaine overtures of peace (because they were loath to expect the wearing them out by hunger, and siege: which in Martiall brunts they could not doe with greatest advantages) in which Overtures they propounded the difficultie, if not impossibility of any succour: which indeed to my owne knowledge was very true. Secondly they proposed any quarter they would desire. Which pro∣positions after consideration thereof had by the be∣sieged (as by men who did not halfe so much fear the imminent danger, nay apparent losse of their lives, as by all presumption it was like as their loyaltie and good example to their King and Countrie) were ut∣terly rejected. The Illustrious Almirante de Castillia being adver∣tised
of the perill the beleaguered were in, did not so highly in words commend their courage, and fide∣litie, but that hee as inwardly dreaded and feared their danger: wherefore convocating a generall Councell of warre, of the most and best experienced souldiers about him, hee imparted the importance, and consequence of the businesse to them, with the difficulties and dangers thereof arising, if speedy re∣medy were not applyed; and therefore commanded their opinions therein, to the best availe of his Ma∣jesties service, and discharge of their own conscience and duty, being intrusted in it. In the neck of which consultation, there arrived a Post from his Catholike Majestie, and his great pri∣vate and prudent, and worthy Counsellour Conde Duke, confirming as it were afore-hand the ensuing resolution of the Councell, which unanimously was to divide the Armie in three parts: the one of which to bee imployed about the busying and diverting the enemies forces from the Towne. And the other two to attend all opportunities and advantages that may be taken or offered, either by the negligence of the enemie, or by the commoditie or scituation of the place, to charge him to his greatest annoy; and to endeavour by all meanes to relieve the begirt Citie of Fuenteravia.
Vpon this resolution taken, and all things readily appoynted, order was given, that the Armie should march at a set and appoynted houre: Mar∣quis de Mortara one of the Spanish Commanders, see∣ing those under the leading of the Almirante him∣selfe to approach neare, commanded the vanguard of his owne Troops to march on towards the E∣nemie. Then fell on with speed, and unspeakable courage the incorporated vanguard of the Corolenia of Conde Duke, and of the two Irish Regiments of the Earles of Tirone, and Tirconell: the Condu∣ctors and souldiers of which seemed for haste and hunger to fight to prevent desire it selfe: so forward they were to doe their Prince service, and his ene∣mies dammage, and detriment: which their desire tooke speedy execution, by their eager and furious falling upon their enemies: so that in lesse than an houre they took in the two next adjoyning Calina's with eleven appoynted posts in them, which the French did possesse. After this, Serjeant Major Barrie, an Irish man of long tryed and approved experience in the warres of the Low Countries and of Germanie; and one who gave good tokens of his great skill, and abilitie in warlike and martiall affaires, and Discipline, as well in this exploit, as in other precedent important ser∣vices, as it is well knowne to many, having the
leading and conduct of the said incorporated van∣guard of the Spanish armie, hee marched on dire∣ctly without stay with incredible warinesse and reso∣lution with his vanguard to the maine great Trench of his enemy, taking as he marched all the advan∣tages and commodities which the scituation of the place would suffer, or any way afford, till hee came within Pistoll shot of the enemies great and strongest Trench; when on both sides there began a bloudie skirmish, with which there arose a great noyse of Drums and Trumpets in the French Camp, when their Artillerie began to roare, and flye bountifully to the Spanish side, with which Barrie skirmishing all this while upon the brinks of the enemies great and mainest trench, and prying narrowly to the enemies doing, omitting nothing that might becom a skilful and prudent Leader to his souldiers, and a dangerous and advantagious enemie to his enemies, going from place to place, still encouraging with comfortable words, where hee found any coldnesse of courage, which hee found in verie few; and putting them in the most forward hope of reward, reforming and setling the ranks in compleat and perfect order, and putting them in generall in memorie of their former and famous attchievements, to the renowne and per∣petuall credit of their Nations both of Spaine and Ireland. So that by these, and other his expert sedulous and skilfull incouragements, hee made of the multitude, as if it had been but one compleat and well composed bodie, and made them so ready and willing to observe his commands, that hee could scarce command, but it was so readily obeyed,
that scarce any difference could be discerned betwixt the command, and the obedience thereunto: hee made them so ready and dexterous to performe his will, as if they had beene the body, and he the head: the body could not obey the will of the head sooner than they did his, which was a thing worthy of note to be done in so short a time, and which undr God was the chiefe meanes of gaining the victorie. Now being thus busie, as is said, he might perceive that the enemies horse made preparation to give a charge upon him: which perceiving, hee approa∣ched nearer unto them, and powred among them a whole▪ volley of shot, and then prepared himself for the fight, giving present instructions to that effect, as one who knew well the valour and resolution of the French Horse: then presently did hee call into the vanguard all the Officers reformed and Cavaliers of the two Irish Regiments, who like valiant and brave Cavaliers made no stay▪ but appeared presently with all diligent Obedience at his beck: Of them did Barrie frame the front of the pikes, to resist the furie of the enemies horse, the shot being several∣ly divided into all possible advantages, to bee taken according to the naturall scituation of the place. Thus all things being in perfect order according to the time, to offend the enemie, and to defend themselves, if he should attempt any thing against them: Barrie dispatched five Officers, Vivo's and Reformed, with present advertisements to Mortara;
and for other helps, as powder, Matches, and such like other necessities, of which he was not so plenti∣fully provided as he would, which his request, Mor∣tara, like a brave, provident, and wise Commander presently granted. Then Barrie seeing that all things were duely and decently ordered for the fight, and that the souldiers were provided to their content, began to incourage them a new with the most comfortable words he could devise, calling upon the common soul∣diers by name those which he knew, the rest he took by the hands and promised them great rewards, spea∣king severally to each Captain, Commander and Of∣ficer under his charge, encouraging them apart; and then in generall shewing them where new re∣liefes were, in all haste marching to them: and after those reliefes, the Reeregard marching in order to their assistance: Then Barrie the second time sent two Reformed Irish Officers, advertising Marquis de Mortara, that if hee did send succour to charge on the right hand of the great Trench, to busie that side, hee with the vanguard would with resolution fall upon the rest of the enemies fortifications upon his perill, and that he hoped to give good accompt of his proceedings therein. Mortara for his owne discharge, and being mightie glad, and joyfull of the hope he conceived what noble effect the worthy at∣tempt of such a couragious crew as Barrie, and his followers were, would bring forth, if it were well seconded, dispatched a message out of hand to the
Almirante, signifying unto him the summe of Ba∣rries honourable requests, and Chivalrous intent, and resolution, who taking consideration of the businesse, and being discussed among some of the chiefest Commanders, Marquis de Torrecusa offered himselfe to bee imploy'd according to Barries re∣quest, who being licensed, departed; and having im∣battailed his men, and incouraged them, as the shortnesse of time gave leisure, hee went manfully and resolutely, and led his men to give charge upon the right hand of the enemies great Trench, as Bar∣rie demanded: but Torrecusa was twice repulst. Yet the third time hee gained that side of the Trench, which he assaulted, and came at last to his appoynted place of Execution with great courage and discreti∣on, where gaining the redout that was on the right hand, hee and his Spaniards, and Neapolitans, fought with such vigour and might, that it was strange to behold, but that it was known they were all chosen and approved men, led by so valiant and wise a Leader as Torrecusa was: And there was another thing that made these doings of Torracusa, and his traine to seeme the lesse strange, which was to see, with what violence and force Barrie and the Van∣guard of the Irish and Spanish under his conduct and command, set upon the rest of the enemies great Trench, which they took and drove back the ene∣mies with such fury, that it was wonderfull to be∣hold: and where Torrecusa fought with his Neapo∣litans and Spaniards, was the cruell effect of Ire and courage to bee seene upon the miserable mangled
bodies of the killed and slaine; the heavy groans of the wounded, the loud shrieks of the distressed dy∣ing souldiers; the neighing of hores, the clatte∣ring of Armour, the clashing of swords and wea∣pons together, where a man may see revenge quench her thirst with humane blood. There was slaughter in her royaltie, crowned with Majesty, carried, and treading upon dead and wounded bodies, and to conclude, there was such a death-breeding confusion and terrible deadly dreadfull noyse of the dying and wounded, and of Drums, Trumpets, and other Militarie instruments, as if halfe the world were as∣sembled together, and had conspired with full in∣tent to destroy all man-kinde in the other halfe, and were assisted by all the severall Elements, such a Confusion there was: for where the Spaniards and Irish fought, there was no resistance to be made against them: for they made such a bloody Massacre and havock of their enemies, that by pure force and dint of sword they drove them out of their strongest fortification. Which Barrie perceiving, and that Torrecusa and hee had the victorie on both sides of the field, by the forcing of their enemies out of that Trench, he commanded, (his thirst of honour be∣ing not yet quenched) the vanguard to advance fur∣ther towards the enemie, which they obeying, imme∣diately, the first troops of Musquetiers advancing in∣to, gave way to the rest to follow them to execute their Commanders will. The French seeing their last refuge to consist in their valorous carriage, with stout courages their Cavallerie gave a brave charge
upon the fore-most troops of Barries souldiers, and made them retire backe into the Trench they had formerly taken. Then immediately againe came fresh succours of Torracusa and Mortara, and then the second time did Torracusa and Barrie advance with the vanguard, and made also a distance of, till the Rereguard arrived, and fell with united for∣ces on the enemie with such furie, that they were forced to make a vertue of necessitie, which was to retire: which if they had not timely and provident∣ly done, they had incurred great and most imminent danger. For if a thousand Musquetiers of Don Pedro Siron, and Don Ioseph desanta Maria, had come upon their backs on the other side in a narrow pas∣sage, hardly could they have retired, or escaped, but with great hazzard and losse. Now the slaughter was the greatest when they came to the Sea side; where Barrie shewed himselfe a man that could use his victorie with moderation, and mercie to the vanquished, which was a vertue so much commended in ancient and famous Cap∣taines, and that deservedly in my conceit: for after that the French were past hope of escape, and that they submitted themselves, and held up their hands for mercie, it was not the part of a man indued with naturall reason, and touched with any tendernesse of Conscience or generositie of minde to kill and murther them so crawling at their feet, and voyd of all power to defend themselves, but rather it became a brutish insulting beast; and as wee heare, there are
some beasts that never insult so, nor exercise any cruell power upon the conquered: but seeing them voyd of defence, leave them so, as namely the King of Beasts, the royall Lion. Which noble vertue of the Lion Barrie notably imitated here: for hee suffered not one man of all the French, that submitted themselves and came out of the Sea, to receive the least hurt or dammage, but preserved the lives of great multitudes, who by all likelyhood had beene all put to the sword, by those that neither regarded their honour, nor the feare of God, but followed and were guided by their owne unmercifull savage humour, and could away with no reason, but their unreasonable and brutish will: which presumption and madnesse Bar∣rie wisely restrained, by appoynting certaine lusty souldiers of his Retinue, to guard the vanquished French: giving them in charge, to use them as ene∣mies, that offered any injurie to the French: which was the meanes as before is said, that great numbers of lives were saved, as the French can testifie; As also with what kindnesse and courtesie the Irish fa∣voured them, being their protectors ever since the fu∣rie was past. Now the French thus defeated and routed, and all their great forces and hopefull preparations bro∣ken, destroyed, and brought to nothing, the spoyles that were taken were presented to the Almirante of Castilia: Where Barrie for his part of the spoyles
presented the Generall with five Ensignes of the French, as a token of his pains taken in that Med∣ley, and Captaine Daniel Mac-Curthy, another Irish Captaine, presented one Ensigne to the Almirante. Torrecusa and Barrie at the taking in of the great Trench of the enemies by them, found therein foure Peeces of Brasse Ordnance, and afterwards in the Batterie they found twentie eight, in all thir∣tie two French Brasse pieces of Artillerie. Almirante de Castilia of whom we spake prettie well afore, gained himselfe, his King and Countrie, this day eternall fame and renowne. As did Marquis de Torrecusa, revive and increase the glorie of his flourishing Countrie of Italy, by his rare and exquisite skil shewed in his prudent con∣duct, as well in this as other happy encounters. The Noble Marquis de Mortara likewise shewed himselfe like a politick and valiant Captaine, as was expected of him, which to his perpetuall fame, he with glorie discharged. The deadly and ghastly wounds of the followers of the Conde de Agilare, likewise made knowne their worthy acts, and eager forwardnesse. The brave souldiers likewise of Mr. del Campdan, Ioseph de santa Maria, and Mr. del Campden Pedro de Siron did no lesse worthy service: as did also Serjeant
Major Barrie, with his couragious and magnani∣mous Irish souldiers, and not onely the Common souldiers, but also the Reformed Officers of the two Regiments of the Earles of Tirone, and Tirconell, being all Irish, as also the Captaines, &c. with their divisions constantly seconding, (as appeareth by the Certificates of Barrie, under whose conduct they served) still with such dexteritie and obedience, that at no necessitie their presence was wanting, till all was ended as afore is mentioned, and at large expres∣sed, to the everlasting renowne of their King and Countrie. And no lesse did appeare the noble mind of Mr. Del Camp Carlo Varsa, by his glorious and brave at∣tempts in this onset. And to conclude with them all in generall, both Spaniards and Irish, and Neapoli∣tans, both Commanders and souldiers, such were their brave on-sets, glorious attempts, and couragi∣ous resolutions in this battaile, and famous (by their atchievements) victorie obtained against their valo∣rous enemies; that all things considered according to the numbers and warlike Equipage, and Martiall ac∣coutrements on both sides. The brave and noble minded triumphing Romans; as namely, Camillus, Publicola, Fabius, Emilius, Cato, Scipio, and the rest that attained by their well-imployed Consulships to their deserved, and most glorious and pompous tri∣umphs over their conquered enemies. Or the re∣doubted▪ and undaunted Greek Heroes, as were the great Macedonian Alexander, the furious spirit
Pirrhus, and the brave Spartan Agesilaus, the noble and worthy Athenians, Pericles, Themistocles, and Alcibiades, or the high minded Thebans, Pelopidas, and Epaminondas, &c. Many more as worthy every way of the Grecian blood and nation, which to their mortal reputation and honour have left infinite volumes full of their most glorious acts, as memorials to all worldly eternitie. These two Nations conside∣red, and each severall person by himselfe considered, with his power, and feats done upon their enemies for so short a time, and unexpected execution. Ne∣ver did he of the one side deserve his insulting gorge∣ous triumphs, and sumptuous sacrifices and cere∣monies, according to the customes of his Countrie; nor they on the other part, better deserve to have their acts graved, and carved in Gold, Copper, or Brasse: Nor to have their Altars, Statues, and preci∣ous Images to preserve and record to future and en∣suing ages, their famous and victorious Conquests, than did these renowned Warriers, Spaniards and I∣rish, serving under the royall Standards and Banners of his most sacred Catholick Majesty, deserve to have the most exquisite, and ready, and skilfull Quills in Europe, to indent and beare record of this their most glorious, and never dying victorie.
Here followes a List of as many Officers and Cavaliers of the Irish as suffered by death and maiming in this bloody fray, by their ea∣ger pursuit of the victorie, in be∣ing still the formost in the execution.

Of which, those that were wounded, and may∣med, those scarres and wounds, they beare as brave and noble badges of their never-yeelding minds, and loyalties, and those that were slaine, left their bodies as the more ignoble parts, and Cabinets (to give their mother earth its naturall due) wherein were contained and kept those haughtie and heroicall dis∣positions, and courages, which were the stirrers and movers of the said bodies, to such noble at∣tempts as wherewith they attained to the glorious Laurell of victorie, for their earthly parts, and al∣so which courages were the precious jemmes, lant∣hornes, and efficients of their owne quiet repose in the high bed of Fame, where the loud and shrill Trumpet of their worthinesse shall perpetually sound out with ecchoing noyse their deserved praises. Now Gentlemen, and Courteous, and impartiall perusers of this, as impartiall and true, but short re∣lation; I would not have you thinke, that what things I set downe here, are but heare-sayes, and
relations of gagling old Gossips in their merrie car∣rowsings: but that which I desire of you, and which I expect as sole reward for the small paines I tooke in penning this small Pamphlet, is, to conceive, (and as the verie and reall truth is) that what I set down here, and offer to your views in everie particular, I was eye and hand-witnesse of, and of all the pas∣sages specified in the precedent relation, and was also a partaker of the greatest hazzards happened in that enterprize, which I hope in your equall ballan∣cing, the truth shall be a helpe and mover of beliefe in your imaginations to my equall distributing of a Relatorie reward to each particular deserver in this great exployt: And also, though I tell you I was par∣taker in the perills; yet to name my selfe, I think it not meet: which also I hope may be a motive in you to my advantage in that way, I desire it, which is still desiring your beliefe to my Relation, and impar∣tialitie of each ones good deserts in this service, which in the faith of a good Christian, and souldier, in no poynt I did faile, according to the retention of my shallow memorie, and small experience it mat∣ters of that nature. So in this, as in your favourable Censure, and construction of this my course, rude, and souldierly penning, and stile; I bid you farewell.
FINIS.
