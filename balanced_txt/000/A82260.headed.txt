A DECLARATION Shewing THE NECESSITY Of the EARLE OF STRAFFORDS Suffering. Printed in the yeare 1641.
THE NECESSITY OF THE EARLE OF STRAFFORDS SUFFERING. SIR, TO give you my advice why it is likely and most probable, I will give you my reason; as causes produce effects, ele∣vation and neare approach of the Sunne argueth Spring; greennesse and flowers, declare Summer; throwes antece∣dents of nativity; clouds portend raine, and laying the cloath a preparation for dinner: He the Earle of Straffords escape of punish∣ment, must of necessity raise a lamentable storme in our calme, as invading our liber∣ties, shipwracking property of goods, cau∣sing punishment upon his impeachers, so that the trienniall Parliament will bee of no
such force as is expected; for besides it will incourage others to doe the like inso∣lencies, oppressions, extortions, outrages and tyrannies; it will undoe our State: consider we therefore his Physiognomy, posture of person, proud carriage, and insolent behavi∣our, it may easily foretell the future, as fal∣ling leaves winter; for his palled colour sheweth revenge; his sower face, cruelty; his stooping and looking to the earth, avarice; his gate, pride; and his demeanour, insolency; for revenge is odious in greatnesse, cruelty abhominable in governours, avarice hate∣full to God and man, as appeares by his sole ingrosing commodities in Ireland, and therefore he will bee homo hominibus lupus, proud in Magistracy, insolent in supreame place, which will breed contempt, contempt impatience, impatience fury, fury rebellion, and rebellion ruine of King and people, for he hath beene so invested by the divell in all deeds, as he can be changed no more then the Leopard from spots, or the Negro from blacknes, and who shall undertake to alter him, laboureth in vaine. The Duke of Ireland Michael de la Pool & his confederates, caused the breaking of the Parliament, when the Parliament had made the Duke of Gloucester and others Com∣missioners to reforme abuses, which were a
mighty pressure then, but those Monsters made all those faithfull Ministers of State, conspirators against King Richard the se∣cond and his prerogative, though these ca∣terpillers were delinquents and laboured the demolition and overthrow of the whole Estate; wherefore it hath beene a rule, that an ill instrument hath alwaies beene made incapable of government and can bee of no use, for the postea; such alwaies have brought an ad quod damnum to the Prince, and mis∣chiefe to the Common wealth; for hee is as subtile as Lewis the eleventh, libidinous as Tiberius, cruell as Nero, covetous as rich Cressus, as terrible as Phalaris, and mischie∣vous as Sejanus, and at the same end may he arrive. I will never beleeve but he aimes at Monarchy whose actions spinne threads of Empire not easie to be numbred, and there∣fore is worthy of no compassion of King or Parliament: for this cause there is no more worthy subject of ruine then the acquests of his manifold deeds; now the Deere which escapes the toile is more mannish, the madde Bull wounded and let loose doth more mischiefe: so if the Earle shall get out of the net he will be more savage then before, like the Duke of Ireland persecuted the Pa∣triots of the Common wealth: for revenge
in cold bloud is more dangerous then in passion, like the Mastive worried returns with others to kill. Consider therefore his wicked facts, in the frontispiece of which, his setting enmity betweene the two Nations England and Scotland, brothers and subjects to one So∣veraigne, his exercising regall authority in Ireland, in impoverishing that Kingdome, fining, imprisoning, causing divers to die, putting out hundreds from their estates by force and armes, starving others for want of flax and materialls, imposing new oathes against Law, and finally breaking up the last Parliament. All which are high treason and are so adjudged in the case of the Duke of Ireland and his confederates in the sixt of Richard the second. Certainly by these barbarous actions hee hath caused the Subjects of England, Scot∣land and Ireland to murmure against the Diadem; for the highest treason of all is to cause the Throne to be despised, the Power neglected, and his subjects to rebell, which in all ages hath beene held (by Civill and Common Law) a most abhominable Dam∣num Majestatis, worse then hurt of Majesty; for if Otho Grandorser for making division betweene the Palatine of Rhene and his
mother lost his tongue and eyes much more, causing Subjects rebell (mem∣bers of the same heads) ought to bee losse of life; The Kings regall power hath beene obstructed and intercepted, eclipsing the shining Throne; it could not command their affections, persons, purses, nor cause them fight against the Scots, whom they thought honest and good Subjects: and not to insist upon one fact, hath not hee caused men to be shot to death and executed? So Alvarode Luna for such pride, in causing a Gentleman of Spaine to have his necke broake out of a window, because he spake ill of him, was executed, though a great fa∣vourite, and upon this reason that it procu∣red the hatred of the people against the King. It is no answer to alledge that he did it by a councell of warre, for it hath no power in peaceable times where the quarrell is for the Subjects right and religion, which the Prince cannot nor ought divorce them from; yea some of them have beene sacrificed to appease the people, though happily not guil∣ty of death; as Commodus the Emperour caused Cleandor to die to appease the multi∣tude, which Emperour was much commen∣ded by the Historians of that time: for that
wicked instruments of State have no bridle but feare of punishment; for which cause the inventors of Gabells impositions and such like have beene rewarded with death; hath not he impoverished the Subjects of Ireland and the County of Yorke, it is most certain he hath; his ambitious minde hath caused him oppresse Ireland, as Sejanus the Roman Monarchie, who received his demerits a shamefull death; his averice in a Subject hath undone the Merchants of Ireland, and op∣pression of Subjects by Subjects deserveth death: and to say the truth this man is grea∣ter then his Ancestors, lesse then his thoughts; which like a whirlewinde hath carried him to so abhominable courses as hath beene brought to passe, man cannot receive, nor fortune give more; if shee had not made him a King it was because shee esteemed it a lesse thing to make him a head of an Empire, then give the head of Monarchie to the prey of one; health, wit, riches, greatnesse and honour, are gifts impoverish the foundresse, if after the gift her avarice did not retake them. There was only the Duke of Ireland had so absolute a power in Ireland, as he. The first laboured to bee absolute Duke of Ire∣land, and so will this if he be not cut off in
his careire: for as others then, so the Papists now, (who are the greater part of Ireland) would if it were in their power make him a King: wherefore it appeares necessary, that he should have condigne punishment, for wickednesse unpunished diminisheth not, but increaseth force; the physicke which this Parliament should administer to the sicke state of the Common-wealth, is sea∣sonable, for nothing is more dangerous in the beginning of feavers then not to let bloud, and it is mortall in gangrenes not to cut off a member; the house of Commons hath voated him a traytor, the grand jury of the Kingdome as hath beene said in other Parliaments; and shall he goe unpunished (God forbid?) likewise hee hath had a most honourable triall before the three Estates, with divers testimonies upon the severall Articles, convinced with prooffes; therefore the Lords by the Earle Marshall ought as in other Parliaments to give sentence, for it ap∣pears by the 25. of Ed. the third Cap. 2. That the Parliament onely hath power to expresse and declare what is treason, and to sentence it in cases not specified by the aforesaid Sta∣tute, the words are these. That if any other case supposed treason not above specified, shall happen before the
Judges they shall tarry till the Parlia∣ment come, before they give sentence, that the cause bee declared before the King and the Parliament, whether it ought to bee adjudged treason or fellony; and this Sta∣tute is perpetuall, no probationer; though in the Statute of three and thirtieth of Henry 8. Cap. 10. the Judges have power to attaint by a Jury, in cases expressed aforesaid, by which the attainted forfeits all his lands to the King, who shall bee in actuall and reall possession of the same lands, tenements, he∣reditaments, uses, goods, chattells, as if the attainder had beene by authority of Parlia∣ment; and so it is reported by Cooke and Di∣er; and in a Parliament in Henry the sixt time, all the Judges of England were of the same opinion, when Thorpe Speaker of the house of Commons, in an adjournment of six weekes, was imprisoned; and at the recesse of the said Parliament, upon com∣plaint of the Commons, the fact being cen∣sured in the house of Commons and trans∣mitted up to the Lords, the Lords asked the opinion of the Judges, the Judges answered they had no power to judge of any Act of the house of Commons, but were subject to them, and what the house of Commons should set downe was Law; by which it
appeares plainly they have power to declare the facts of the Lord Strafford treason, which I humbly submit to the high Court of Parliament. And whereas it is observed that all Pa∣pists speake well of him and his actions, it is very likely in recompence thereof he would bring in Popery vi & armis, having power under his Majesty to raise armes, and all for a Bulwarke to support his greatnesse, like to that of France. Now the cause of God is in our hands, which if you omit, you shall never have the like opportunity to doe God and the King good service. Wherefore my prayer to God shall bee to open his Majesties eies to see the danger he and all we are in. Gloria Deo, Filio, & Spiritu sancto. FINIS.
