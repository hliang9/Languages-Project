VVonderfull PROPHECIES. IN the latter end of the reign of King James, at Abbington in Barkeshire, being at one Vickers his House in the Stert, I saw a Man that told me the things that should happen unto this Kingdom; One remarkable thing was, One Ar∣my should lye at Abbington, and another Army at Oxford, and, That these two should fight one against another; but God would judge them for their Brothers blood; He told me ma∣ny remarkable things concerning my own Conversation which have already come to passe, and many things that are yet to come, which is admirable; many things are yet to come to passe concerning the whole World; He told me, That all the Bookes in the World should be taken away from the use of man, the Reason was shewed me, some had Bookes, but they would have no body but them∣selves to read in them, therefore they shall have none to read in; some said they were Litterall, therefore they shall not have a Letter to see; some say, They must be more spirituall, they shall have 5 Yeers time to Exercize the Gifts of the Spirit; At that time the Crea∣ture shall be delivered from the vain Conversation of men that are now subject unto vanity; Every one must confesse their sins one to another; Every Woman that bares Children, must after that time confesse the true Father of them; he must take them home, and keep them whilst they are young, and they must work for him when he is old: at that day, every one will be in perplexity, God judgeth every man according to his workes, all men shall be judged accorning unto him that earneth but 10d. a day; if one earn 2s. 6d. a day, he must worke three times so hard, else he will be judged for a Thief; He appointed me to make Paper according to his direction, and to present it to him whom they that love him not, call him their King; and bid me
tell him, That He shall cause the Scripture to be Printed in that Paper; tell him, There are great abominations committed in the Land; some men finde fault with the Pride of other men that ride in Coaches, yet pull them out, and go into them themselves in the sight of the People, and the People finde fault with it, if he will not hear thee, carry it to the Speaker, tell him what he shall do with it; if he neglect it, tell the Major and the Sheriffe of t, carry it to the Exchange, and give it to the Mercbants freely, if they neglect thee, it will be ill for them all; get one to go with thee to set men at worke, make a Boxe, let him carry it, see that thou doe not touch it, if there be a Stone-wall before thee, if the wall remove, thou must go forward; advise them in the Cities to carry their necessary goods into the Country, God will not have so many to live so neer togethr, every man shall be resto∣red to the condition as Adam was after his fall, he was ashamed of his sinnes, humbled himself before God; but men are fallen so far now, they sin in the presence of God, saying, They will con∣fess their sins to God, yet Act it in his Presence, and are proud of it; Ask them if they know God in their own bosome? ask them if they know the Image wherein they were created? advise all men that they spoile not Barly, for they must learn to drinke water, they should do good to their Enemies, they should feed them, but they will not feed their Children for fear their ene∣mies should eate part of it; they had rather plant Thornes and Bryers, then to plant fruit-trees; they should have repaired that which Sathan defaced, if they had planted Fruit-trees in the fields, they might have had the leaves of them; thou shalt see a Cart-load of Skins, being Records; Prophecy against them, say they shall bear record no longer, Prophecy to them on the right hand, and on the left, Tell them, they should take heed, the place where they sit shall burn like a furnance, they think they can easily get forth, but they that are withoutside shall keep them in; Chancery there will be new money, at that place beate out the stampe which was before; say, He knows what it is to be a King? Cesar must account for what he hath taken more then what is his, The Kings of the Earth make money, and buy such things as they lack, and when they lack money, they send for it again, Tell them how they shall agree with their Adversaries that would make Peace with them; Give them Peace-offerings rather then take any Impose upon them the Gospel, as all men
may understand it; shew them how they should subdue all their enemies under them, kill none of them, but take oppor∣tunity to do them good; you can send a man a thousand Miles, and he findeth him to whom you send; you finde not the way way to Jesus Christ: I have sought Counsell and Instruction of the wise and Learned men of this Kingdom, whom this Person that appeared to me may be, but they all refuse to give me In∣struction; when all men neglected me, the Lord manifested him∣self unto me, entring into me by the Power of the Spirit, judge∣ing of me what I had done in the flesh, manifesting himself to be my salvation, whom I saw at Abington: the manner of the comming of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus upon me, was by touch∣ing lightly the haire of my head, so soaking down into my head, it made all my necke and shoulders to rise; after two hours, it entred into my soul; whereupon I being in great fear and trouble, cryed unto my Lord and Saviour, beseeching him to interceed for me unto God my heavenly Father, and I heard a voice to my understanding, saying, Thou dost not pray; my An∣swer was, Lord thou knowst I do pray: he answered again, not with all thy heart; I intreated the Lord to search my heart, and try it, feelingly it removed from the Place where it was, to my heart, bringing my Prayers to remembrance, asking me, Whether God would except of such Prayers as I had prayed formerly, I was questioned of all the intents and purposes of my heart, what I had done, and what I intended to do, asking me, Wherefore I did work? answering him, I told him to live; he said to me, That I was not willing to die to live with Christ; I said, I waited the Plea∣sure of the Lord, I was adjudged for the Transgression of the whole Law of God, and for opposition against the Government of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; my understanding was o∣pened, and I was shewed what it was, and I was shewed his Go∣vernment, and what it was. He told me, I should be first up in my family, and last abed; I should see all things in good Or∣der in the morning, I should cause all my family to come toge∣ther, cause a Chapter to be read, and pray with them and for them, I should earn my own bread, and fetch my own Water; I must give to every one rather then receive, I should use as much as I could of the Talent which God gave me, but as little as I could of that which is committed unto Sathan; Gods Talent is a reasonable understanding soul, which every one ought to im∣prove
to the glory of God, the good of himself and others; that which is committed to Sathan, is the earth and the glory thereof, I was judged for emnity against God my heavenly Father, I acknow∣ledged it was true, I was asked then, How I thought to scape the damnation of hell? I said it was that wound which we recei∣ved in our first Parents, and it cost the precious blood of my Lord and Saviour: It was asked me, Whether I had no other hope? I answered, No, There was no other Name under heaven whereby I may be saved: And I said, I knew, if my Lord and Saviour was pleased to apply one plaister of his precious blood with his own hand to this my wound, which was a pain upon the midst of my belly: immediately upon my Faith and con∣fidence the pain departed from me; then I gave thanks to my Lord and Saviour: he said, yet thou mayest sin a sin and be damned: I intreated him to tell me what it was, he opened my understanding and shewed me what it was, and shewed me the revelation where it is to be found: Take heed that ye are not ashamed to behold the appearing of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, glory, honour, and worship to his holy Name for ever. Would you not have me tell you what God hath done for my soul: I wish that all men did fear the Lord. I have sought the Counsel of several Ministers this many years; I spoke of it to Mr. Hilton Minister of Billinghurst in Sussex 14. years since, and divers of his neighbours: I asked seven Ministers at one time, what I might do to be saved; they said it was a necessary question to be asked, but they said it was not the businesse of the day, therefore they deferred it, but said it should be answered; the time past one year, I desired to be satisfied of some instructions of the Scripture by some learned men; and desiring them to tell me whom they thought he might be that spoke to me at Abington; I invited Doctor Chanel to my house, and twelve Ministers besides to try my Faith, whe∣ther it was rightly grounded upon the Word of God accord∣ing unto his will; and I desired them to tell me whom they thought it might be that told me all things remarkable that had and should happen unto me; he said that there was no man able to tell me such things; he said I was deluded: I told him how he should know whether I was or not, for he bid me invite you to my house, but he said you would not come; if you would
come to morrow then I shall think that I am deluded; when the morrow was come, there came never a man which I invited. My Lord and Saviour told me 28. years before, there would a Minister send me word that he would come to me upon a Tuesday, he said I should take heed, for he was the Devil; he said make thy Will, set thy house in Order, make clean thy house, humble thy self before God, fetch a burthen of Straw, and lie naked in it all night: so I caused Doctor Chanel to make my Will; I lay in the straw, a Minister came to perswade me that I should grant him one thing before I knew what it was; that I should put no more trust in my Lord and Saviour which I spake with at Abington; then I remembred four men that was assigned unto me, which were Ministers, I was appointed to go to them and command them to chuse two a piece, whom they pleased, and come to my house and Judge me, and things which I should make known unto them; I was appointed to choose a Witness in the morning before they came, and tell him what they would say when they did come, and what I was appoint∣ed to do, and say to them: I asked four questions in seven years; the first was, How I should be born again; the second was, What I should do to be saved: the third question was, The hones of the Paschal Lamb being not broken, whether it signifieth any thing in our days or not: The fourth, If a man take his wife in the Act of Adultery, whether he ought to put her away or not? But they gave me no satisfactory answtr; one was angry with me, because I said that a man could not be born of the water of Baptism. I thank the Lord he hath satisfied me that all men that will enter into his government, must be born up by his Word and by his Spirit: he that will be saved must be zealous of the honour and glory of Jesus Christ which was crucified at Jerusalem; they that will be his body must keep his instructions; they that will be his Sponse should not joyn themselves unto an Harlot; ye that have received the first fruits of the Spirit, sigh and groan within your selves, waiting for the manisestation of the Sons of God, to wit, the redemption of our bodies, I mean our deliverance from the power of Tyrannie, which forceth us to kill our enemies, sometimes our friends for their will and pleasure: our Lord hath shewed that we should do good unto our enemies, and then we should do good unto our friends. After the day of Restauration, the Horses, the Kine, and those
necessary Creatures will be subject unto none but unto those that are subject unto Jesus Christ: and men shall be known to be Christians by the gifts of God; the Creatures will be sub∣ject unto them, as it is said, The Creature shall be delivered into the glorious Liberty of the sons of God: Men of England, subject your selves unto the Gospel and Government of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as it is briefly made manifest in the four Evangelists; lest the Creature be delivered from use and com∣fort of this Nation, know the only true God in your own bo∣som, know that the Spirit of the Lord is in you accusing or excusing: Whether your actions be good or evil, know Origi∣nal righteousness; For this is eternal life, that ye know the only true God in your own bosoms, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. My Lord shewed me that it was very dangerous to die in debt; we should agree with our adversaries while we are in the way; if any man trespass against us we should forgive him, and do him some good: my Lord shewed me the Angels were very rational, and looked upon us as we look one upon ano∣ther, and judge our love unto our God; As we like the Work∣manship of his hands, they are offended because we like not the form which he hath made: we shew God that we would have him make Horses without tails, and some without ears; our own Toes all of a length, just strait and square; some feet a little forked; our heads and knees bigger; our arms as big at the hands as they are at the shoulders: the wood which God giveth us to build our houses we like it not of that colour, but make it of some other, still shewing our dislike. Lord have mercy upon us, The Whore of Babylon knows no more how to be born again then Nicodemus. Husbandmen Plow and Sowe, whilest you have cattel, for the day of Restauration is on New-years-Day next coming. ¶ I have divers other things to reveal concerning the World, the Sea, and this Nation; I have made Paper, and brought it up to London; and have put the Bible to Print in that Paper, and am about to get the most usefull Book of Navigation written out, or Printed, as I was com∣manded by my Lord and Saviour; But I am confin'd to this sheet; and so end. All glory and worship be unto GOD, and unto Jesus Christ our onely Lord and Saviour for evermore, Amen. By me NICHOLAS SMITH. THE END.
