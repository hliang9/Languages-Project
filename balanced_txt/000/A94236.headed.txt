But was lyable to fall, and being left to the free∣m of his own will, so he did. Gen. 3.6. 8. Q. In what state are we now born since the fall? A. 1. We are born guilty of Adam's first sin. Rom. 12, 19. 2. Destitute of God's favor. Eph. 2, 3. 3. Destitute of God's image. Gen. 5.3. Rom. 7.18. 4. Under the sentence of condemnation. Ro. 5.16. 5. Prone to all evil. Psa. 58.3. 6.

9. Q. How doth it appear that without a Savio we could not help our selves or escape the wrath of God? A. 1. The fallen Angels cannot escape it, therefo neither could we without a Saviour. 2 Pet. 2, 4. 2. Adam without a Saviour must needs have peris therefore so should we. Gen. 3.8. 3. The Law or covenant of works cannot justi any transgressor, Rom. 8, 3. 4. God who hath threatned us, Gen. 2.17. and u on our fall accordingly hath condemned us, Ro. 5, 1 cannot lye: therefore without a Saviour bearing t Curse for us, we must needs have born it our selv for ever, Gal. 3, 13. 5. We being God's creatures, finite beings, a sinners; can never do or suffer any thing sufficient  satisfie the infinite Justice of God offended, to turn  way his infinite wrath incensed, or to redeem our l Souls from infinite Misery deserved; that for our o sakes God should discharge us, Isa. 40.16, 17. Ro. 5 6. We cannot redeem a Brother from tempo death, Psa. 49.7, 8. much less our own lost Souls fro eternal. 7. We continually offend, and cannot but increa our score, that we might hasten our Ruine; so far a we from being able to purchase our own salvation.  7.20. 8. Our very best duties are stained, and need a ∣viour for their pardon and acceptation; so far are the from being able to make amends for our offences, N 13, 22. 9. God did not send his Son without need in resp
us, to endure scourgings and so sharp a death for ur Redemption, Gal. 2.21. 10. Q. How doth it appear that Christ is able to save us? A. 1. The H. G. in the Scriptures and in Believers earts, doth estifie that Christ is able to save us, Heb  25. Rom. 8.33, 34. 2. He is the Saviour that should come into the world; r is there any other, Mat. 16, 16. Jo. 6.36, 37, 39. ct. 2.30. 3. He is a Saviour of the Fathers own providing, om. 3.25. Isa. 42.1. Jo. 1.19. 4. We find the first Adam could undo us, and can∣not the second much more save us, Rom. 5.15, 16, 17. 5. God did graciously lay our sins on him, that his ghteousness might be imputed unto us, 2 Cor. 5.21. 6. Christ undertook the work of Redemption with light, Heb. 10.6, 7. and finisht it, Jo. 17.4. fulfilling  righteousness, Mat. 3.15. and offering himself a Sa∣fice for us, 1 Cor. 5.7. that no more need be done for r Redemption, either by himself or any other, Heb.  8, 10, 12, 14. 7. He is God blessed for ever, that hath done and suf∣ed all this for us, Mat. 1.23. Rom. 3.21. Act. 20.28. re is therefore an infinite worth in his obedience  sacrifice. 8. The Father did delight in his person, Mat. 3.17.  satisfied with what he did, Jo. 8.29. and with what suffered for us, Eph. 5.2. that he hath raised him from  Dead and received him to Glory, Eph. 1.20. 9. Christ doth now expect his purchase. He. 13.13. 10. The Angels believe God's good will towards , Lu 2, 11, 13, 14. on the account of Christ.
11. The Father punisheth on Christ's account to re∣new the hearts of sinners, forgive their sins, and save their Souls, Heb. 10.14, 16, 17. Isa. 49.6. 11. Q. What reason have we to be reconciled to the providence of God, or his governing and ordering of all things? A. 1. There is a necessity that some Being or other should order and govern all things, Rev. 12.7. 2. There is no creature able or fit to do it, Job 4.18. 3. It is most righteous and meet, that he who made all, should dispose of all, Isa. 45.9. 4. The Lord is most holy, and will wrong no man, Gen. 18.25. 5. It is good for us, wicked men and Devils cannot carry on things as they would have them, Ac. 4.27, 28. 6. And that he who gave Christ for us manageth all things, Jo. 5.17. 7. He will be good to him that waiteth for him, to the soul that seeketh him, Lam. 3.25. 8. He is full of love to the Upright, and will order all for their good, Psa. 11.7. 9. He is unchangeable in his kindness and good will to his people, 1 Sam. 12, 22. 10. He is most wise and knows how to order all for the best, 2 Pet. 29. 11. He is most mighty and able to restrain evil, and bring good to pass, Isa. 43.13. 12. He is most faithful to his word, Psa. 25.10. 13. He sets himself against none but the ungodly and impenitent, Exod. 34.6, 7. 12. Q. Ʋpon what terms is God willing to save us?
A. 1. If we truly Repent, that is, heartily grieve for our sins, Ps. 51, 17. ingeniously confess, 1 Jo. 1, 9. and throughly turn from them to the Lord, Ez. 18.21, 22. 2. If we unfeignedly believe in Christ, Joh. 3.16. and in God through him, 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. 3. If we sincerely obey the Lord, Exod. 19.5. 13. Q. Must not we design and labor, by keeping the Commandments, to satisfie God's justice, and purchase forgiveness and favor with him? A. 1. We must by Faith, trust in Christ's righte∣ousness as that which hath already satisfied God's ju∣stice, and purchased forgiveness and favor with God, Philip. 3, 3. 2. If we have not Faith to trust in Christ's righte∣ousness, we must in the use of all means seek it of God's free grace, Cant. 1.4. 3. Obteining Faith, we must obey God's command∣ments, to testifie our love to God in Christ for his grace towards us, Isa. 6.8. 4. And to please God, Col. 1.10. 5. And to testifie our subjection to Christ, Psa. 2.12. 6. And to glorifie God, Mat. 5.16. 7. And to make sure our own salvation, 1 Ti. 6.18, 19. 8. But we must not by our Obedience, think to sa∣tisfie God's justice, and purchase forgiveness and favor with God. For 1. Nothing can satisfie God's justice and purchase forgiveness and favor with God, but a righteousness which fully answers the threats of the Law, for we are sinners, Gal. 2.20. which fully answers the commands of the Law, for we are humane Crea∣tures, Mar. 12.30, 31. which is of infinite value, that it
might bear proportion to the infinite evil that is in sin, the infinite blessedness that is to be recovered, and the infinite misery from which there is to be deliverance Isa. 40.16 and which God hath appointed to that end, Heb. 10.5. 2. Our best Obedience comes far short of all this. 3. Christ's righteousness comes up to all this, Gal. 3.13. Mat. 3.15. Act. 20.28. Heb. 10.9. and the Father graciously accepts it for us, Job 33.24. 4. For us to go about our own obedience to satisfy God's justice and purchase forgiveness and favor with him, is to have too high thoughts of our selves, Lu. 18.11. too mean thoughts of God, Job 22.2, 3. to despise Christs righteousness, Heb. 10.29. to reject God's grace, Gal. 2.21. to undertake an impossible task, Ec∣les. 7.20. to lose all, Rom. 9.31. 5. By faith to relye on Christ's righteousness, as that which hath already satisfied God's justice for our sins, and purchased forgiveness and favor with him; is to have a due esteem of Christ s righteousness, Phil. 3.8, 9. a due esteem of God's grace, Gal. 2.21. to be tru∣ly humble, Hab. 2.4. to obey the Gospel, Jo. 6 29. to take a sure way to Justification and Life, Mat. 16.18. 14. Q. How are we Justified? A. 1. The Father doth justifie, Ro. 8, 33. by impu∣ting to us Christ's righteousness, Ro. 5.19. and for the sake thereof pardoning and accepting of us. 2. The Son doth justifie us, Act. 13.39. bringing in everlasting Righteousness, or obeying his Father unto death to satisfy his justice, & purchase his favor for us. 3. The H.G. doth justify us, 1 Cor. 6, 11. by work∣ing
faith in us, and helping us to apply Christ. 4. Free grace doth justifie us, Rom. 2.24. by provi∣ding a surety for us, accepting faith for the condition of our interest in him, and giving faith and Christ tous. 5. The Gospel doth justify us, by revealing, Ro. 1.16. and offering Christ to sinners, Rev. 22.17. apply∣ing and making over Christ to believers, 1 Pe. 1.20, 21. and being the Rule by which God will proceed in Judgement, Rom. 2.16. 6. Faith doth justify us, Ro. 3, 28. by embracing and trusting in Christ, & so giving us an interest in his righ∣teousness, because God hath made it the great condi∣tion of the Gospel. 7. Works do justify us, by being an evidence of, and help unto our Faith, Ja. 2.24. 15. Q. What are the saving acts of a lively Faith? A. 1. To believe what the Scripture speaks concern∣ing Christ, so as to trust in him for Justification and Sal∣vation. Gal. 2.16. Or to believe so as to receive Christ for justification and salvation, Joh. 1.12. 2. No act of a dead Faith is justifying or saving, Ja. 2.14. Not believing the truth concerning Christ, Act. 8.13. Not beleiving so as to trust in him, Jo. 2.23. Not be∣lieving so as to receive him, Luk. 8.13. 3. Faith is then lively when it not only believes what is revealed in the Word concerning Christ, so as to trust in him and receive him for Justification and Salvation, but likewise so, as to prize him, 1 Pet. 2.7. Love God for him, 1 Ti. 1.15, 17. as to be thereby humble, Hab. 2.4. Purified, Act. 15.9. Sanctified, Act. 26.18. as to work by Love, Gal. 5.6. Overcome the World, 1 Jo. 5.4. be emboldened to appear for Christ, 2 Cor. 4.13.
as to do and suffer great things for God and Christ when called to it, Heb. 11. 16. Q. What inducements have we to believe in Christ for Salvation? A. 1. We are utterly lost in our selves, Mat. 18.11. 2. None but Christ is able to save us, Jo. 6.68. 3. Christ is abundantly able to save us, Heb. 7.25. 4. We are graciously called and invited to him, Ma. 11.28. 5. He is freely offered to every one of us, Re. 22.17. 6. We are commanded to believe, 1 Jo. 3.23. 7. We have a promise that if we believe in Christ we shall not perish, Jo. 3.16. 8. If believe not in Christ, we shall never partake of him, but perish without remedy, Mar. 16, 16. 9. Other great sinners have found favor with the Lord, Lu. 7.47. 1 Tim. 1.13. 10. We can never be holy, Heb. 11.6. nor stedfast with God, if we will not believe in Christ for Salva∣tion, Heb. 3.12. 17. Q. When do we sincerely obey the Lord? A. 1. When we are not false hearted with the Lord, Psa. 51.6. 1 Chron. 12.33. Jer. 3.10. 2. When the Rule and Motive of our Obedience is the Lord's Command, Psa. 119.5, 4. 3. When the principle of our Obedience is love to the Lord, Phillip. 1.16, 17. 4. When the end of our Obedience is to please the Lord, 2 Cor. 2.17. 5. When our Obedience is willing and hearty O∣bedience, 2 Chr. 29.. Col. 2.23, 24.
6. When we are careful to frame our inward, as well as outward man, according to God's Word, Mat. 25.25. 7. When the bent of our heart is against every thing that is evil, and forevery thing we know the Lord requires of us, Ps. 119.80, 128. 1 Chr. 29.19. 1 Kin. 9.4. 8. When though we have many failings yet the ge∣neral Course and Tenor of our life is squared by the will of God, Psa. 112.2, 3. Job 17.9. Jam. 1.8. 2 Chr. 15.17. 9. When we hold on in our obedience, Psa. 112.2, 3. Jam. 1.8. despising baits that would entice us to de∣stroy, Cant. 8.7. and welcoming crosses we meet with in obeying, Act. 20, 23, 24. 10. When still we have mean thoughts of our selves and fly to free grace and Christ's merits for accep∣tance, knowing how short we come in many things, Neh. 13.22. Heb. 11.4. 18. Q. Are we able by the strength of Nature to re∣pent, believe, and sincerely obey the Lord, or need we spe∣cial renewing grace and strength from God to help us? A. We need special Grace and Strength; For 1. That grace of Faith that saves us, is not from our selves, it is the gift of God, Eph. 2.8. and such grace we need. 2. Regeneration is needful for every one of us, Jo. 3.3, 5. and this is a special work of God's Spirit. 3. God's promise of special renewing grace, Eze. 36.26 and of special strength, Psa. 110.3. are no pro∣mises of needless things. 4. God doth give special grace to assist herein, for
he gives more to the Elect, than he doth to others, Mat. 13.11. 5. None of us make our selves to differ, 1 Cor. 4.7. therefore we neither Repent, Believe, or sincerely O∣bey without special grace. 6. God's image being lost by the Fall, Ro. 7.18. until we are renewed by grace, it cannot be, we should have any might to do what's spiritually good, Rom. 9.16. Eph. 2.1. Jo. 6.44. Jer. 10.23. Rom. 8.7. 7. We cannot without special grace, so much as un∣derstand the good of spiritual things, 1 Cor. 2.14. much less can we will and embrace them. 8. Our corruptions in our natural state are so strong withstanding against us, that without special grace we cannot do what is spiritually good, Jer. 13.23. Ro. 8.8. 9. We are by nature under Satan's power, Ep. 2.2. We need therefore the mighty arm of God, to set us free, Act. 26.18. 10. Whenever we seriously endeavor to return to God, we then find that by the strength of Nature, we cannot, Jer. 31.18. 11. Even those that have the advantage of renew∣ing grace, find need of further assistance from God to do what's good, Cant. 14.2 Cor. 3.3. Gal. 5.17. Rom. 7.23. 12. They that are indeed enabled and so brought into a saving state, ascribe this to the special work of God, Tit. 3.5. 19. Q. After what manner, and by what degrees are men ordinarily changed and renewed by the Spirit of God?
A. 1. Usually they are made to see their sin and dan∣ger as they never saw before, Act. 9.4. 2. Then they are filled with abiding fear of God's wrath, Act. 9.6. 3. They hear, and mark, and pray, if by any means they may escape, Act. 16.14.9, 11. 4. They are made to see more worth in Christ, then ever they saw before, Gal. 1.15, 16. 5. They have some refreshing hopes, though a pos∣sibility of escaping, Jonah. 3.9. 6. They earnestly desire and use all means to get Christ, Rev. 21.6. 7. They are made to see God's grace and good will to give Christ freely to them, Tit. 3.4. 8. Their hearts are melted with this grace, Lu. 7.38. 9. They are encouraged to receive Christ freely offered to them, 1 Tim. 1.15. 10. They are filled with love to the Lord, Jo. 21.15. 11. They can easily yield now to put away what's displeasing, and chose what's pleasing to the Lord, Lu. 19.8. 12. They have an abiding bent of heart for ever to cleave to the Lord. Rom. 8.35. 20. Q. What are the priviledges of those whose hearts are thus savingly renewed? A. 1. They are united to Christ, Eph. 5.30. 2. Christ's obedience and sufferings are imputed to them, Rom. 5.19 3. They are justified from all their sins, Rom. 8.30. 4. God is their reconciled Father, 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. 5. They have that peace the world cannot give, Jo. .
6. The H. G. is given to carry the Son in Obedi∣ence, Pro. 1.23. Ezek. 36.27. 7. They shall never fall away, Isa. 42.3. 8. All shall work together for their good, Ro. 8.28. 9. When they dye, their souls shall be carried in Abraham's bosom, Luk. 16.22. 10. They shall have a blessed resurrection, Jo. 5.29. 11. They shall have a publick justification, Ma. 25.23. 12. They shall have eternal Salvation, Mat. 25.46. 21. Q. What are the Miseries of those that are no thus savingly renewed? A. 1. They are Christ-less. Eph. 2.12. 2. They are not in favor with God, Eph. 2.3. 3. They have no sure title to Salvation, Rom. 3.23. 4. They stand condemned by God's Law, to ever∣lasting death for sin, Ro. 5.18. 5. If they continue in that state till they dye, they be irrecoverably lost, Eccles. 9.10. 6. They are never to enjoy comfort more, Luk. 16.25. 7. They have lost God for ever, 2 Thes. 1.9. 8 They are to rise again to everlasting contempt, Dan. 12.2. 9 They are to be Condemned publickly at Judg∣ment, Mat. 25.41. 10. They are to be carried Body and Soul into a Lake of Fire and Brimstone with damned spirits, Rev. 20.15. 11 They are to live for ever in that Lake to feel their torments, Rev. 14.11. 12. Through blindness and false peace they are not
like to prevent their misery, unless God of his infi∣nite mercy bestow grace on them, Je. 2.34. Prov. 23.34. 22. Q. Since God only can savingly renew us what should a poor graceless sinner do to obtain it of God? A. 1. He should frequently think what a happiness 'tis to be saved; what a misery to be damned, Isa. 52.15. 2 He should settle it in his heart, that an unre∣generate Christless sinner cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven, Jo. 3.5. 3. He should beware, least willful unbelief, Gen. 19.14. false peace, Luk 17.28. Love of ease, Luk. 13.24. and pleasure, 1 Tim. 5.11. Purposes for the fu∣ture, Mat. 8.21. make him trifle away his season and prove his bane. 4. He should speedily break off from bad Compa∣ny, 2 Cor. 6.17. and gross sin, Isa. 1.16. least he provoke God never to give him grace while he lives. 5. He should believe God is willing to change and save some sinners, Jer. .14. having given Christ to dye for them, and chosen them from Eternity, Isa. 51.11. 6. He should hear, Luk. 10 39. and pray, Joel. 2.32. and read and pray, Jo. 20.31. and converse with God's people and pray, Jo. 4.39. if by any means he might obtain of God a saving change. 7. He should resolutly hold on in the use of means, though he loose all his Labour at last, Luk. 5.5. 8. He should not suffer the affairs of the World to take him off, Lk. 8.14. nor the delays of God.
1 Sam. 13.8, 9. nor renewed sins, Psa. 147 11.  the temptations of the Devil, Mat. 12.43. nor  scoffs of the Wicked, Jo. 12.43. nor the unkindness of the godly, Psal 55.13. nor the impatience of  Flesh, Lam. 3.26. to discourage him in his pur of grace 9 When Gods Spirit discovers Wrath, he sho willingly and patiently yield to the Conviction to  prepared thereby to welcome Grace, Rom. 8.15. 10 He should let every little glimpse of men cherish hope still, still, to wait on God, Jud. 13.2 Lam. 3.22. 11 He should not account himself savingly chan∣ed, till he is made to take his greatest content in G Psal. 73 25. and Christ Phil. 3.8. and holiness Ps 2. Jer. 6.10. 12 He should trust in the name of the Lord, Isa. .10. and frequently cast himself on the merits  Christs Blood, Heb. 6.18. though he perish, if were possible, when he hath done. 23 Q. What's to be done before hearing the W to profit by it? A. 1. We are to have Faith in God's Ordinan Isa. 55.10. Rom. 1.16. 2. We should acquaint our selves with our spi∣tual state, Jam. 4.6. 3 We should put away all sin from us, 1 Pet. 1, 2. 4 We should pray for a suitable Word, and blessing on the Minister, and on out selves, Pr. 2.3.
24. Q. What's to be done in Hearing? A. We ought to be reverent as before God, Act. 10 2. We ought to apply the Word to our selves, . 40.7. 3. We should watch against wandrings, Isa. 55.2. 4. We should have short ejaculations towards God bless this, and that Word to us, Psal. 119.10, . 25. Q. Whats to be done after Hearing? A. 1. We should reflect upon our miscarriages, . 1.5. 2 We should recal what we heard and did affect us, k 8.12. Heb. 2.1. 3. We should observe how the Word suits with od's Providence in the course of our Lives, Psa. 73. . 4. We should immediatly put the Word in pra∣ctice, Gen. 21.14. Psal. 119.60. 26 Q. How should we read the Word of God to ofit by its? A. 1. We are to read often at least once a day, eut. 17.19. 2. Before Reading we should look up to God for  blessing, Mar. 8.6. 3. In Reading we should keep a depending Eye on od for enlightning, Psal. 119.12. 4 We should consider what goes before, and what lows that we may understand, Mat. 24.15. 5 We should Read believingly, as the Word of od, Rev. 19.9.
6 We should fix one or two things which  affect us, Psa. 119, 11. 7 We should have an high esteem of it, Psa  10. 8 We should oft think of it in the business of  day, Psa. 119.97. 9. We should live suitable to it, Psal. 119.59. 27 Q. Are the Children of Believers now exter∣nally in the Covenant with God, as the children  the Israelites were of old? A. 1 Yes, 1. Believers are the engrafted memb of that Body of people whose Children were so ∣ken into Covenant, Rom. 11.17. Eph. 2.14, 15,  Ro. 12.4. 1 Cor. 12.12. 2 Believers are children of the Promise as Isa  was, Gal. 4.28. 3. The Gospel is for taking in all those that w not received before, Ro. 9.25. Therefore not  excluding the children of believers, who were taken  before. 4 The Kingdom of Heaven the highest blessing  the Covenant belongs to the children of believe  Mat. 19.14. 5. The children of Believers are called Ho 1 Cor. 7.14. as by reason of the Covenant, the Peo∣ple of Israel were so called heretofore, Deut. 14.1, . 6 It is expresly said, the Promise doth belong  Children, Act. 2.38, 39. 7 If the children of Believers were utterly ex∣cluded from God's Covenant then not having do any actual evil themselves, the children of believing
Jews were loosers by Christ's Death, and by their Pa∣s Faith; there would be no difference between y Believers children, and the children of Infidels, ere would be no hope of the Salvation of any of em dying in Infancy, Eph. 2.12. 8 So extensive and free is Gods grace, that, as of d a Prosels child, and servant, and servants child as taken into Covenant with God, as well as himself, Exod. 12.48. so now a believers Child and Servant d Servants Child, even all within his Family are ken into Covenant with God, on the believers ac∣count, because he is a Child of Abraham. Luk. 19.9. 28 Q. What advantage is it to be externally in Ce∣nant with God? A The same that it was to the Jews of old.  Though those who are not by means of believ∣ing Parents thus in Covenant, are not to dispair, ct. 10.34. Isa. 56.6. Gen. 22.18. 2 And all are not Infallibly saved who are thus in ovenant with God, Mat. 8.12. Deut. 29.4. Gen. . 10.25.25. Rom. 11.20. 3 Yet such are more nearly related to God then e rest of the World, Ezek. 16.8. Mat. 8.12. . 1.2. Rom. 9.4. Lev. 25.42. 4 If they dye in Infancy there is more hope of their Salvation then of others so dying, Eph. 2.12. . 112.2. Exod. 20.6. Gen. 19.24. 1 Sam. 15.3. 5. If they live and are wicked, there is greater e of their conversion, then of other wicked men,  Chron. 32.33.33.12. 6 They have greater encouragement to seek God
in all their wants, Deut. 4.7. Hos. 12.6. 7. They may plead in their Parents right, whe they doubt of their own, Gen. 32.9. 8. They will have greater cause to honour their Parents when they see blessings by means of them de∣rived to them, Psa. 116.16. Exod. 15.2. Pro. 17.6. 9. This is a greater encouragement to their Pa∣rents to pray for them, Gen. 17.18. and give the a good Education, Gen. 18.19. 10. This lays an obligation on others to deal kind∣ly with them, Gen. 25.41.42. 2 Sam. 19.1. 11. This lays a great obligation on them to devo themselves to the Lord, Psal. 116.16. to serveth Lord, Acts 24.14. Levit. 25.42. and live holily Deut. 7.6. and make sure of Salvation, Mat. 8.12. to love God like children, Rom. 9.4. to make Go their refuge in all their streights, Deut. 4.7. and t Repent when they have sinned against him, Hos. 12.6. 12. And those who are thus in covenant with God though Infants, are to be baptised. 1. Because God vouchsafed to his Church the pri∣viledge of confirming his Covenant, by applying the initiating Seal thereof to the Children of believers Gen. 17.10. and never repealed it. 2. This confirmation of the Covenant by the in∣itiating seal did belong to the children of the Mystical seed of Abraham, though they were not his natural seed, Exod. 12.48. 3 Children being in Covenant, there is the same
reason why they should be baptized, as there is, why their believing penitent Parents should, Act. 2.38.39. 4. The Gospel-initiating seal being a Badge of the Lords people, and a further Obligation of them to be his. Believing Parents by their own Covenant with God are bound to apply it to their Children, Gen. 17.0. as by the fourth Commandment they are bound o cause them, when grown up, to sanctifie the Christi∣an-Sabbath; and as by the second they are bound to ee them attend on other parts of the Gospel-Institu∣ted Worship. 3 When the Jews shall be Converted, the initiating al in force, is to be applyed to their children, as heretofore, Rom. 11.24. Ezek. 47.13, 14.36.10, . 6 Baptism being a means of partaking the special essings of the Covenant, Regeneration, Tit. 3.5. doption, Gal. 3.26.27. Sanctification, Col. 2.11, . Eph. 5.26. the washing away of Sin by Christs ood, Act. 22.16. and Salvation, Mar. 16.16. the children of believers needing all this, and being as papable of baptism as heretofore of Circumcision, e not to be debarred from the Ordinance. 7 It is a dangerous thing to keep from the Initia∣ting sel of the Covenant, Gen. 17.14. Exod. 4.24. . 29. Q. What is to be done before Receiving the rds Supper? A. 1. We must see we be in charity with all, at. 5.23. 2 We must search to find out our graces and our
sins, 1. Cor. 11.28. 3 We must judge our selves for sin, 1 Cor. 11.31. and cry to the Lord to obtain forgiveness through Christ's blood, Jer. 29.13. 4 VVe must resolutly put away our sins, Ezr. 6.21. 1 Cor. 5.8. 5 VVe must stir up our selves unto better obedi∣ence, Jer. 7.5. 6 VVe must get a sence of our particular wants, Luk. 18.41. 7 VVe must get hungrings after Christ, Rev. 21.6. 8 VVe must come with humility, Psa. 22.26. 9 VVe must come with expectation, Act. 3.5. Heb. 11.6. 10 VVe must be sure that our ends be good. 30 Q. What should our ends be in receiving the Lords Supper? A. Not to approve our selves to men. But, 1 To obey Christ, Luk. 22.19. 2 To profess Christ, 1 Cor. 11.26. 3 To keep up remembrance of Christ, 1 Cor. 11.24. 4 To receive Christ, Mat. 26.26. 5. To get nearer Communion and fellowship with Christ, 1 Cor. 10.16. 6 To unite our hearts to one another, 1 Cor. 12.13. 7. To engage our hearts to live to Christ, 1 Cor. 10.21. 8. To get spiritual strength to live our engagement, 1 Cor. 10.16.11.29.
9. To confirm our faith touching Gods Covenant and pardon of sin, Mat. 26.28. 31 Q. What is to be done in receiving? A. 1. VVe are to approach with an humble sense of our unworthiness. 2 VVe are to exercise Repentance, Faith and Love. 3 VVe are to send up often Ejaculations heaven∣ward. 4 VVe are carefully to avoid all distractions. 5 VVe are diligently to observe the Sacramental Actions. 6 VVe are reverently to engage our hearts to live to Christ 7. VVe are to remember Christ. 32 Q. What are the Sacramental Actions, and and their signification? A. 1. The Ministers Blessing, signifies the Fathers sending Christ in the fullness of time to perform the VVork of our Redemption. 2 His breaking the Bread signifies the breaking of Christs body, and shedding of his Blood. 3 His giving, signifies Christs giving himself to the receivers if they accept of him, and live to him. 4. The Peoples taking signifies their taking Christ to be their Saviour, and binding themselves to live to him. 5 Their Eating and Drinking signifies their full and sweet enjoyment of Christ, by Faith, as the bread of their lives. 33. Q. What is to be done after receiving? A. 1. VVe should reflect upon our failings and
cast our selves on the Lords grace, and Christs metits for pardon, 2 Sam. 23.15. 2 We should not rest in the work done, but keep a depending eye on the Lords Grace for a blessing. Gen. 49.18. 3 Under doubts, Judg. 7.10.13, 14, 15. Temp∣tations, 2 Cor. 5.15. Fals, Psa. 89.34. and variety of Providences we should reflect on the Sacrament and improve it for our Spiritual strength and comfort. 4. We should study which way best to express our Love to Christ, Psal. 116.11. 34. Which way should we best express our, Love to Christ. A. 1. By remembring Christ, 2. Tim. 2.8. 2. By labouring for assurance of Faith, that Christ is ours, Phil. 3.10. 3. By keeping up an high esteem of Christ, Cant. 5.16. 4. By maintaining communion with Christ, Jo. 15.4. 5. By living by Faith on Christ for acceptance, and strength, Isa. 45.24. 6. By not grudging Christ the performance of du∣ty against sloathful self, Deut. 10.12. 7 By not being ashamed to own Christ, 2 Cor. 4.13. 8 By not thinking much to suffer for Christ, Act. 20 24. 9 By loving one another, Jo. 15.12. 10 By being stedfast in Covenant, Psal. 16.12, 14. 35 Q. How should we pray that God might hear and accept of us?
A. 1. Not rashly, Eccl, 5.2. 2. Nor impenitently, Prev. 28.9. 3. Nor in malice, Mat. 5.23. 4. Nor in Unbelief, Ja. 1.6. But 1. In Humility, Psa. 34.18. 2. In Sincerity, Psa. 145.18. 3. In Faith, Mark 11.24. 4. With Fervency, Ja. 5.16. 5. With dependance on Christ's Spirit for assi∣stance, Rom. 8.26. 6 VVith dependance on Christ's Merits for Ac∣ceptance, Jo. 16.23. 1. VVith Perseverance, Luk. 18.5, 7. 36. Q. How should we enlarge our selves in Prayer? A. In the strength of the H. G. we may enlarge after this manner. 1 For our sin. 1. VVe may confess our Fall, and the corruption of our Nature, in the whole man. 2. Then the good we have left undone. 3 Then the evil Thoughts, VVords, and Deeds we have done against the Law, and Gospel. 4 Then we may bewail the greatness of our sins, as committed knowingly, willingly, frequently, against all the Attributes of God, Death of Christ, and Mo∣tions of the Holy Spirit. 5. Then we may acknowledge the dueness of Cor∣poral, Spiritual, and Eternal punishment, Judging our selves. 6 Then we may bless God that Sentence is not Ex∣ecuted, and that mercy is to be had in Christ.
2. For our wants. 1 VVe may intreat that God would not punish, but pardon us through Christ's sufferings, humbly and thankfully applying Christ and the Promises. 2 Then that God would Sanctifie us, subduingsin, bestowing Grace, Repentance, Faith, and Love. 3. Then that God would manifest Reconciliation to us. 4. Then that he would follow us with his quick∣ening Spirit, to overcome our spiritual Enemies, do his will in all things, and grow in grace. 5. Then that God would Sanctifie Mercies, and Afflictions to us, and bless us in the outward Man. 6 Then that God would bless his Church, his afflicted People, our Governours, Friends, and Ene∣mies 3. For our Blessings. 1. VVe may praise God for our temporal blessings, our Being, Limbs, Health, Peace, Protection, Provision. 2 Then for spiritual blessings; that there is an Ele∣ction, that Christ is given for us, that we have the Gos∣pel, that he hath given us Faith and Holiness, if we be sure of it. 3 Then for any extraordinary, or new Mercy. 4 Then we may acknowledge the greatness of our blessings, from Gods greatness, our unworthiness, and need. 5. Then we may engage our selves to live his praise, commending our selves to his Grace for aid. 37 Q. What further Rules may be given to help us in the use of this method.
A. 1. We may premeditate of our Sins, Blessings, and Wants according to this Method. 2. What passages of the Word, or providence do affect us, we may, in our thoughts, add them to that part of this Me∣thod which is proper for them to keep furnished for Prayer. 3. Before Prayer it is needful to get our hearts affected with God's Majesty, and Grace; one Sin, one Want, one Blessing at least. 4. We should not be over-careful for expressions. 5 We should not covet to go on faster than the assistance of God's Spirit depended on doth carry us. 6. We need not tye our selves to every part of this, or any other Method; but contract or add, as we find our hearts may be inclined 7. We must not covet to be over-long. 8. Practiseing first in private, we shall the better carry it on with others. 38. Q. What is the happiness of Heaven? A. 1. There is no sin, Psal. 130.8. Nor sorrow, Rev. 22.3. 2.

There is no Dying, Rev. 9 6. 13. There is no end of the Torment, Mat. 25.46. 14. Ther's no pity, God himself laughs at all this, Pr. 1.24.26. 15. There is the height of sin, every mouth Blaspheming God, Rev. 16.11. 40. Q What will be the proceedings of the day of Judgment? A. 1. Christ will come in the Clouds, Rev. 1.7. 2. The Trumpet will sound, 1 Cor. 15.51. 3. The dead will be raised, 1 Cor. 15.51. 4. All will be cited before him, Joel, 3.2. 5. The Sheep will be separated from the Goats, Mat. 25.32 6. Every mans actions will be tryed, 2 Cor. 5.10. 7. The sentence will be passed, Mat. 25.34, 41. 8. Execution will close up the day, Mat. 25.46. 41. Q. How should we make sure of Gods acceptation against that day? A. 1. We must judge our selves, 1 Cor. 11.31. 2. We must flye to Christ by Faith, 1 Thes. 1.10. 3. We must put away sin, 2 Pet. 3.14. especially Censo∣riousness, Mat, 7.2. Immoderate care and Intemperateness, Luk. 21.34. and all degrees of Revenge. Ja. 5.9. 4. We must cherish a silial fear of God, Prov. 14.26. 5. We must improve our Talents, Mat 25.21. 6. We must appear for Christ, Mat. 10.32. 7. We must watch and pray, Luk. 21.36. 8.

I Believe in God, the Father Almighty maker of Heaven and Earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, Dead, and Buried;Continued in the state of the Dead. he descended into Hell, the Third day he rose again from the Dead, he ascended into Heaven, and siteth on the right hand of God the Father, Al∣mighty,
from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I Believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgivness of Sins, the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting. Amen. The Ten Commandments. Exod. 20. GOD spake all these words, saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage. 1. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. 2. Thou shalt not make unto thy self any graven Image, or any like∣ness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth be∣neath, or that is in the Water under the Earth; Thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil∣dren unto the Third and Fourth Generation of them that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments. 3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labour and no all thy Work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt do no manner of Work, thou, not thy Son, nor thy Daughter thy Man-servant, nor thy Maid-servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy stranger that is with in thy Gates; for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the sab∣bath-day, and hallowed it. 5.
