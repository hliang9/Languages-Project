❧ By the King. ¶ A Proclamation touching the Surueying of the Seacoales of Newcastle, Sunderland, and Blythe. FOrasmuch as the Commoditie of Seacoales of Newcastle vpon Tyne, Sun∣derland, and Blythe, within Our County of Northumberland, and Our County Palatine of Duresme, and the places thereunto adioyning, is a merchandize so vsefull, aswell in respect of the decay of wood already much wasted within this Our Realme of England, as also in respect of the transporting of them into forreigne parts to the aduancement of the Trade of this Kingdome, by the natiue commodity thereof, as that We haue thought it a matter well worthy Our speciall care, and much im∣porting the state and welfare of this Our Common wealth, to vphold and maintaine the repu∣tation and value of the same: And whereas vpon Information and Complaint made vnto Vs heretofore, of the many and great deceits, and abuses, done and offered vnto Vs, and Our louing Subiects of this Our Realme of England by the Oastmen, Diggers, Getters, and Traders for Coale in the Coale∣mines of Newcastle, Sunderland, and Blythe aforesaid, and in all other places thereabouts, where the said Coales are digged and gotten, who in stead of good and merchantable Coales, send and bring vnto Our citie of London, and other parts of this Our Realme of England, and elsewhere, much Blacke earth, Drosse, Slate, and other vnmerchantable stuffe, which ariseth in, and about the said Coale-pittes, and is blacke like Coales, but not fit to burne, or Fuelable, and which the Oast∣men, Diggers and Traders in Coales, doe well knowe, and yet doe purposely and voluntarily mingle the said deceitfull Blacke earth, Slate, Stone, and other vnfuelable stuffe amongst their good Coales, and sell and vtter the same for good and merchantable Coales, to the enriching of themselues, the preiudice of the Common-wealth, and the disgrace, and discredite of the said com∣modity in forreigne parts: Wee thereupon taking into Our princely care and consideration, the qualitie of these abuses, and the consequences thereof, and much desiring a reformation of the same, yet Our care was, that the said abuses informed of, might first euidently appeare to bee such indeede, as they were alleadged to be, and the Offendors and their manner of offending discouered thereby, the better to finde out a remedy to preuent the like inconueniences, and to that end Wee did referre the examination of the same, first vnto some of Our Counsell learned in the Law at that time, who made certificate
thereof vnto Vs, and afterwards the Lords, and others of Our Priuie Counsell, vpon Petition exhibited vnto them by the Traders, and Laders of Seacoales at Newcastle, did take conside∣ration of the same, and did order and appoint a tryall thereof, to bee had by a legall proceeding in Our high Court of Starre-chamber; vpon which triall, as also by the certificate aforesaid, it did then appeare, That there were, and are seuerall sorts of Coales, at, or neere Newcastle, some of tenne and eleuen shillings the great Chaldron, which are good and fuelable, and some of foure or fiue shillings the chaldron, which are drossie, and vnfuelable, fit onely for Salt-pannes, and Lime-kilnes; And that albeit there are sufficient store of good Coales to serue the Realme of England, and forreigne vent, without any mixture of the bad, yet neuerthelesse the Oastmen, and Traders for Coales at Newcastle, (claiming a speciall Priuiledge to sell them to the Shippers) haue vsed voluntarily to mingle the good Coales with the bad and drossie Coales, and to sell them so mingled to gether at the highest prices of tenne and eleuen shillings the chaldron, warran∣ting them all to bee of the best Coales, by this meanes gaining almost halfe in halfe, which said voluntary mingling, and corrupting of Coales, Our said Court of Starre-chamber found to be a great and generall abuse and enormity to Our whole Realme, and very meete to be suppressed, reformed and punished, And did then decree, that the offendors, then the Defendants, should be committed to the Fleete, and fyned twenty pounds a piece. And to the end that others might take notice, how far Our said Court did mislike, & condemne the said fraud and deceit, and their resolution to punish the same, The said Court thought fit, and so ordered, that the said Decree should bee publiquely read in open market, in the towne of New∣castle, where the said offence had beene committed, on two Market dayes, when most people were assembled, for the more publique declaration thereof to the Countrey, as by the said Decree more at large appeareth. And whereas, notwithstanding that exemplary punishment, inflicted by Our said Court of Starre-chamber, as aforesaid, and the publique manifestation thereof, before declared, Our desire for a due reformation of the abuses before mentioned, did not take that effect which Wee expected, but the deceits, and abuses aforesaid, did rather more and more increase, insomuch as the Masters, Wardens, Assistants, and companies of Wood-mongers, Brewers, Chaundlers, and other Tra∣ders in London for Newcastle-Coales, became petitioners vnto Vs, crauing Our gracious fauour and assistance for the due reformation thereof; whereupon, and vpon consideration againe thereof had, by seuerall committees from the Lords, and others of Our Priuie Councell, at seue∣rall times, vpon seuerall petitions exhibited, aswell by the Wood-mongers, Brewers, Chaundlers, and Traders for Coales in London, and other Porte Townes within this Our Realme of Eng∣land, as also by the Shippers, Masters, & Owners of Ships, trading for Coales from Newcastle a∣foresaid, and vpon suruey, and examination of the true state of those Coale-mines, and Coale-pits, by their Lordships speciall directions had, and taken, it appeared, and was found, that the abuses and deceits aforesaid, (notwithstanding the pretences to the contrary) did yet continue, and that there was no meanes so probable for reformation of the same, as the vigilant care and paines of faithfull and industrious persons, to be imployed and attendant at the Coale-pits, and Wharfes, of Newcastle, and other places adiacent, and they to be furnished with absolute authority from Vs, for the prohibiting, and preuenting of the deceitfull mixture of Coales, by the Oastmen and others, and to make certificates of the goodnesse, or badnesse of Coales, for the buyers direction, and auoi∣ding of deceits therein not discernable by the eye; And the said Lords, and others of Our Priuie Councell, did humbly propose vnto Vs, diuers limitations, orders, and prouisions, which they con∣ceiued fit and obseruable in the execution of the same. Wee therefore hauing well considered, and
pprooued of the propositions, and prouisions before mentioned, and of the great care, and extraor∣dinary charge vsed in the discouery of the abuses aforesaid, and of prouiding, propounding, and set∣ling a fit and apt meanes for the reformation thereof, haue graciously beene pleased, not onely to reuoke all former Letters Patents, by Vs made for that purpose, (they in some particulars being found to bee defectiue,) but by other Our Letters Patents vnder.

And for the better obseruation and performance of Our will and pleasure in the same, We haue in, and by Our said Letters Patents, made, ordained, appointed, constituted, and erected an office to haue perpetuall continuance, which for euer hereafter shall be, and shall be called the office of Surueyour of Coales to be shipped at Newcastle, Sunderland, and Blythe, or any of them, or at any other places adiacent, to be brought and transported to Our citie of London, or other places of this Our Kingdome of England, or any the parts beyond the Seas; Which said office, We, of Our es∣peciall Grace, certaine knowledge, and meere motion, and at the request and nomination of Our late right trustie and right welbeloued Couzen and Councellour, Lodowicke Duke of Richmond and Lenox, since deceased, Haue by Our said Letters Patents graunted vnto Our trusty and welbelo∣ued Sir Robert Sharpeigh Knight, and Alexander Haitely Esquire, to hold to them and their Assignes, for the space of one and twentie yeeres, with such Fees and Allowances, and such Cautions, Di∣rections, Limitations, and Promsions for the execution thereof, as by the said Lords, and others of Our priuie Councell haue beene thought fit and aduised, as in, and by the said Letters Patents nore at large may appeare.
