A boke ma∣de by Iohn Frith prisoner in the tower of London / answeringe vnto M mores lettur which he wrote agenst the first litle trea∣tyse that Iohn̄ Frith made concerninge the sa∣cramente of the body and bloude of / christ vnto which boke are added in the ende the articles of his examinacion before the bishoppes of Lon∣don / winchestur and lincolne / in Pau¦les church at London / for which Iohn Frith was condemp∣ned ād after burēt in smith felde with out newgate the fourth daye of Iu¦li. Anno. 1533. ¶Mortui resurgent.
¶The preface of this boke GRace and encreae of kno¦welege from God the fa∣der thorow oure lord Ie∣sus criste / be with the chri¦sten reader / and with all that love the lorde vnfay¦nedly Amen. I chaūced bing in these parties / to be in cōpanie with A christen broder wiche for hys commen∣dable cōuersation / And sobre behavour myght better be a bishop thē many that weare myters yf the reule of. s. Paule were regarded in ther election.1. Tim. Tit. 1. Thys broder after moche communica¦tion / desyrid to knowe my mynde as touchynge the sacrrament of the body and blode of oure sa¦vioure Christ. Whiche thynge I opened vnto hym accordynge to the gist that god had gevyn me. Firste I proved vnto hym that yt was non article of oure fayth necessarie to be beleved vn¦der payne of dānaciō Thē I declared that christ had a naturall bodie / evyn as myne ys (savyng synne) and that yt cowde no more be in two pla¦ces at once then myne can. Thyrdly I shewyd hym that it was not necessarie / that the wordes shulde so be vnderstonde as they sounde. But that yt myght be a phrase of scripture / as ther ar innumerable. After that I shewyd hym cer∣ten suche phrases and maer of speakyng. And that yt was well vsed in oure englishe tong ād finally I recyted after what mauer they myght
receyve yt accordynge to christes institutyon / not fearyng the froward alteracyon that the pre¦stes vse contrarie to the firste forme and institu¦tion. When I had sufficiently published my myn∣de / he desired me to entitie the sme of my wor∣des / ād write them for hym / be cause they semed oueronge to be well rteigned in memorie. And abeit I was loth to take the mater in hande / yet to fullfyll hys instant intercession / I toke vppon me to touche this terrible tragedie / and wrote a treatise / whyche be side my paynfull im¦presonmēt / ys lyke to purchase me moste cruell deth / which I am redie and glade to receyve wt the sprite and inward man (allthough the fleshe be frayle) when so ever yt shall please god to lay yt vppon me. Notwithsondinge to say the tru¦the I wrote yt not to the intent that yt shuld haue byn published For thē I wolde haue tou¦che the mater more ernestly / and haue writyn / as well of the spirituall eatynge and drynkyn∣ge whiche ys of necessite / as I dde of the carnall whiche ys not so necessarie / for the treatise that I made was ot expedient for all men / albeit yt weare sufficiet for them whom I toke in han∣de to ensructe. For they knewe the spirituall and necessarie eatynge and drynynge of his bo¦die and bloode which ys not receyvyd with the teth and belye / but with the ares and fayth / and only need instrucyon in the ouward ea∣tynge / whiche thynge I therfore only declared But now yt ys commen a brode and in many mens mowthes / in so moche that master more wc
of late hathe busted hym sellfe to medle in all so¦che materes (of what zele I wyll not defyne) hath sore labored to cōfute yt but some men thin¦ke that he ys ashamed of his {per}te and for that cause doth so diligently suppresse the worke wc he prynted. For I my sellfe saw the worke in prent in my lorde of wynchesters howse / vppon S. Stephyns day last paste. But nether I ne¦ther all the fryndes I cow make / mighte attay¦ne any copie / but only one wrytyn copie which as yt semed was drawyn oute in great haste nat¦withstondinge I can not well Iudge what the cause shulde be / that hys boke ys kept so secret¦te. But this I am right sure of / that he neuer touched the foūdaciō that my treatise was buyl¦ded vppon. And therfore syth my foun¦dacion stondith so sure and invinci¦ble (for els I thynke verely he wol¦de sore have labored to haue vndermined yt) I wyl ther vppon buylde a lytle mo¦re / and allso declare that his ordinan¦ce ys to slender to breake yt downe all though yt we¦re sett vppon a wors foundacyon.
¶The fondacion of that lytle treatise was that yt ys non article of our fayth necessarye to be belevyd vnder pay∣ne of dampnacion / that the sacrament shuld be the naturall bodie of christe: which thyn¦ge ys proved / on this maner. FIrste we muste all aknowelege that yt ys non article af o{ur} fayth which can save vs nor which we are bounde to beleve vnder the payne of eternall damnacion. For yf I shulde beleve that hys verey naturall bodye bothe fleshe and bloode we¦re naturaly in the brede & wyne / that shulde not save me / seinge many beleve that / and receyve yt to ther dampnacyon / for yt ys not hys prsen¦se in the brede that an save me / but hys presen¦ce in my herte thorough fayth in hys blode / wc hathe washed oute my synnes and pacyfied the faders wrathe toward me. And agayne yf I do not beleve his bodely presence in the brede & wi¦ne / that shall / not dampne me / but the absence out of my harte thorough vnbeleffe.Obiectiō Now yf they wolde here obiecte that though yt be truth that the absence oute of the brede coulde not dampne vs: yet are we bounde to belve yt / be cause of goddes worde whiche who belevyth not / as moche as in hym lyeth / makythe god al lyer. And therfore of an̄ obstinat mynde not to beleve hys worde / may be an occasiō of dāpnaciō SoluciōTo thys we may answer / that we beleve god¦des
worde and knowelege that yt ys trewe: but in this we dissent whether yt be trewe in the sense that we take yt in or in the sence that ye take yt in And we say agayne / that thought ye haue (as yt apereth vnto yow) the evidēt wordes of christe / ād therfore cōsiste in the barke of the letter: yet are we cōpelled by conferringe of the scryptures to gether within the letter to serche oute the minde of o{ur} sauio{ur} wc spake the wordes And we saye therdly / that we do it not of an ob¦stinate mīde. For he that defendeth a cause obsti¦natly (whether yt be true or false) ys euer to be rep̄hended. But we do yt to satifie our cōscien¦ces whiche are cōpelled by other placys of scri¦pture / reasons and doctours so to Iudge of yt And evyn so ought yow to Iudge of youre par¦tie / and to defende youre sentense not of obsti∣natie / but by the reason of scriptures which cau¦se yow so to take yt. ād so ought nether partie to dispyse other / for eche sekyth the glorie of god / and the trew vnderstondynge of the scripture. This was the fondacyon of my firste treatise that he hathe left vnshakyn / which ys agreat argumēt that yt ys very true For els hys preg¦nant wit could not haue passed yt so clene over But wolde haue assayled yt with some sophisti¦call cavellacyon which by hys paynted poetre he might so haue collered / that at the lst he might make the ignorāt some apparēce of trou¦the / as he hathe done a gaynste the residewe of my firste treatice / which neuertheles ys true ād shall so be proved. And firste that yt ys none article of our fay∣the
necessarie to be beleved vnder payne of dāp¦nacyon may thus be furder confermed? The sa∣me faithe shall save vs which saved the old fade¦res before Christ ys incarnacyon But thy we¦re not bounde vnder payne of dampnacyon to beleve this poyt / therfore yt shall follow that we are not boūde therto vnder the payne of dāp¦nacyon, The furste parte of myn argument ys proved by. S. Austen ad Dardamū. And I dare boldly ay almost in an .C places. For I thynke there be no proposicyō wc he dothe more oftyn inculcate then thys / that the same faythe saved vs wt saved o{ur} faders. The seconde par∣te ys manyest / that yt nedeth no probayon. For how coulde they beleve hat thynge wc was never sayde nor don̄ / and wt out the worde they coulde haue no faythe / vppō the trewth of thes too {per}tyes muse the cōclusiō nedes folowe. Not wtstondinge they all did eat Christys bodye ād dronke hys bloode spūally / allthough they had hym not p̄sent to ther teth. And by that spūall eatynge (wc ys the fayth in hys body & bloode) wer saved as well as we ar For assone as o{ur} fore father Adā hade trāsgressed goddes precept,Adam. ād was fallen vnder cōdempnacyō / oure moste mer¦cyfull father of hys gracyous favo{ur} gave hym the {pro}misse of helthe and cōfort / wherby as ma∣ny as beleved yt / were saved from the thrauldō of their trāgressyon / the worde ād promyse was this / I shall put enmyte betwene the ād the wo¦man / betwene thy sede and her sede / that sede shall trede the on̄ the hede / and thow shall trede yt on̄ the hele.Gene. 3. In thys promisse they had kno∣welege
that Christe shulde becom the sede or so¦ne of a womā / ād that he shulde distroye the d¦vyll wt all hys power / ād dlyver hys faytheful frō ther synnes. And where he sayd that the de¦vyll shulde treade yt on the hele / they vnderstod ryght well that the devyll shulde fynde the mea¦nes by his wyles & wycked ministres to put Christe to dethe. And they knewe that god was true / and wolde fulfyll hys promisse vto thm and hartely longed after this sede / and so dede bothe eate hys bodye and drynke hys bloode / knoweleginge wt infinite thankes / that christe shuld for ther synnys take the {per}fie nature of manhode vppon hym / and also suffer the dethe. This promisse was gevyn to Adam / and saved as many as did beleve and were thankefull to God for hys kydenes and after yt was establys¦hed vnto our father Abraham by the worde f God / which sayd / in thy sed shall all nacyons of the erthe be blyssed.Abrahā Gene. 12. And with hym God made a couenant that he wolde be hys God ād do hym good. And Abraham agayne promised to kpe hys preceptes and walke in hys wayes. Then God gave hym the sacrament of cyrcsion ād cauled that hys covenant which thynge not wt stondynge was not the very covenant in dede / although yt were so cauled. But was only asigne / tokyn / sacrament or memoryall of the couenant that was betwene God and hym (whi¦che myght expound our matter / yf mn had¦yen to see. After that God promised hym a so¦ne when hys wyffe was past chylde bearynge and he allso very old. Neuerthelesse he doubted
not of goods worde. But suerly beleved that he wc promised yt was able to performe yt. And that was recounted vnto hym for ryghtwysnes Thys Abraham did bothe eate hys bodye and dryke hys blode (thorough faythe) belevinge verely that Christ shoulde take our nature ād sprynge oute of hys sede (as touchynge hys fle¦she) and allso that he sulde suffer dethe to rede∣me vs. And as Christ testifyeth he hartely desy¦red to se the day of Chrit.Ioan. 8. And he sawe yt ād re¦ioysed he sawe yt in faythe and had the day of christ / that is to say all those thinges that shulde chaunce hym playnly revelated vnto hym / al∣beit he were dede many hundred yeres before yt were actualy fulfyllyd & reelatd vnto the worlde. And by that fayth was he saved / ād yet never did eate hys fleshe with hys teth / nor ne¦ver beleved that brede shulde be hys bodye and wyne hys blode. And therfore sith he was also savyd with oute that faith and the same faythe sha save vs which saved hym I thynke that we shall also be saved yf we eate hym spūally (as he ded) although we never beleved that the brede ys hys bodye furthermore that mercyfull MosesMoses. which brought the childern of Israell oute of Egypte in to the wyldernes optayned of God by prayers / both mana from hevyn to fe¦de hys people & also water oute of the stone to refresh & comforte them. Ts mana and water wre evyn the same thyng vnto them that the brede ād wyne ys to vs for as S. Austyn saythe Quicun{que} in manna Christum intellexerūt eun¦dem quem nos cibū spiritu alem manducauerūt
Quicun{que} autē de manna solā saturitatem que siuerunt manducabant & mortui sunt.Aug. de viteagen derum. Sic etiā eundem potum: petra enim erat christus. That ys to say / as many as in that māna vnderstode Christ / did eate that same spirituall meate that we do / but as many as sought only to fyll ther bellyes of that māna (the fathers of the vnfayth¦full) did eate & are ded. And lyke wise the same drynke for the stone was christ. Here may yow gather of S. Austyn that the manna was vnto them. As the brede ys to vs and lykewise that the water was to them as the wyne ys to vs / whiche anō shal apere more playnly S. Ausyn sayth furder manducauit & Moses manna / mā¦ducauit & Aaron / manducauit & Phines / man¦ducauerunt ibi multi qui do placuerunt & mor¦tui non sunt.Aug. so∣per Ioā tacta. 2 Qure? quia visibiem cibum spii¦tualiter intellexerūt / spiritualter esurerūt / spi¦ritualiter gustauerūt / vt spiritualiter satiarn¦tr. Omnes eandem escam spiritualem mandu∣cauerunt / & omnes eundem potum spiritualem biberunt / spiritualem vti{que} eandem: nam corpo¦ralem alteram (quia illi manna / nos aliud) spiri¦tualem vero andem quam nos. Ut omnes eun∣dem potū spiritualem biberunt aliud illi / aliud nos: sed spē visibili quod tamē hoc idē significa¦ret virtute spirituali. Quomodo eundem potū bibebant (inquit apostolus) de spirituali sequē¦ti petra: petra autem erat Christus. This ys to saye Moses allso dede ate māna and Aaron ād Phinees did eate of yt and many other dide the¦re eate of yt / wc pleassed God and are not dede Wherfore? Because they vnderstode the visible
meate spiritualy. They were spiritualy an hon¦gred / they tasted yt spiritualy / that they might spiritualy be replenished. They did all eate the same spirituall meate / and all dranke the same spirituall  drynke. Ee the same spirituall me¦ate albeit an other bodely meate / for they dede eate manna / and we eate an̄ other thynge / but they did eate the sam spirituall which we doo. And they all did dynke the same spūall dryn∣ke. They dranke one thynge & w an other: but that was in the owtward apparence / which neuerthelesse dyd signifie the same thyng spūal¦ly. Howe dranke they the same drynke? They (saythe thapostl) drāke of the spūall stone follo¦wyng thē / ād that stone was chryst And ther vn¦to Beda added these wordes. Videte autem fide manente signa uariata. That ys to say. Behold that the sygns are altered / and yet the fayth a¦bydeth one.Beda u¦per. 1. cor 10. Of these laces yow may playnly {per}eyve not only that yt ys non article necessa∣rie to be beleved vnder payne of dampnacyon / seinge the old faders never beleved yt. And yet did eate crist in fayth bothe before they had the māna / ād more exp̄ssely thorough the māna and wt no lesse frute whā the māna was ceased. And albeit the māna was to thē as the sacramēt ys to vs / ād they eate evyn the same spūall meate that we do / yet were they never so madde as to beleve that the māna was chaūged in to christes owne naturall bodye. But vnderstode yt spūaly that as the owtward man̄ did eate the materiall mā¦na wc cōforted the bodye / so did the inwarde man̄ thorough fayth / eate the bodye of christ belevin¦ge that as that māna came downe frō hevī ād cō∣forted ther bodies / so shulde their savyo{ur} christe
wc was {pro}mised thē of god the fad come downe frō hevyn ād strēgth their soules in everlasyng lyffe redemynge thē frō ther synne by hys deth ād resurrexciō. And lyke wise do we eate chri∣ste in fayth both before we cme o the sacramēt ād more expressly thorough the sacramēt / ād wt no lesse frute after we haue recyved the sacra∣mēt ād nede no more to make yt hys naturall bo¦dye / then the māna was / but might moche better vnderstōd yt spūalye / that as the owtward man dothe eate the materyall brede wc ōforteth the bo¦die so doth the inwarde mā thorough faythe ate the bodie of christe / belevynge that as the brede ys brokyn / so was christes bodie brokē on the crosse for o{ur} synnes wc cōforteth o{ur} soules vnto lyffe euerlastynge. And as that faythe did save thē wt oute belevynge that the māna was alte∣red into hys bodie / evyn so dothe thys faythe sa¦ve vs although we beleve not that the substāce of bred ys torned into hys naturall bodie. For the same fayth shall save vs wc savid thē. ād we are boūde to beleve no more vnd payne of dāp¦nacyō then they were oūde to beleve. They be¦leved in god the fader almighty maker of hevyn ād yerth / ād all that ys in thē. They did beleve that christe was the sone of god.Gene. 1. They did bele¦ve that he shoulde take o{ur} nature of a vyrgyn.Psal. 1. Esay. 7. Actes. 3. They beleved that he shulde suffer the deth for o{ur} delyuerāce wc thynge was signified in al the sacrifices / ād besydes that testified in every {pro}¦phet / for ther was not one prophet but he spa¦ke of that poynt.Actes. 2. Psal. 1. They beleved that hys soule should not be lefte in hell / but that h shoulde a¦rise from deth and reigne euerlastīg wt his fader
And to be shorte / there ys no poynt in oue cre¦de / but that they beleved yt / as well as wee doo & those articles are only necessarie vnto salvaci¦on For them am I bounde to beleve / ād am dāp¦ned wt oue excuse yf I beleve thē not. But the other poyntes cōtayned in scrypture allthough they be vndoubted verites / yet may I be saved wt oute them. As beyt in case that I never hard of them / or when I here of them / I can not vn¦derstond them nor comprehend them / or that I here them and vderstond them / and yet by the reason of an other text misconstrn̄e them / as the bohemes doo the wordes of christe in the .6. cha¦piter of Ioan̄. All thes I saye may be don wt ou¦te anye ieo{per}die of dampnacyon. In euery text ys but only one verite or wc yt was spokyn̄ ād yet some textes ther be wc of catholike doctours are expounded in .vi. or .vij. sondry fashions. Therfore we beleve thes articles of our crede: in thother ys no pare / so that we haue aproba¦ble reason to dissent from them. But now to re∣torne to our porpose / yf we wyll examen the au¦ctorytyes of s. Austyn and Beda before alleged / we shall espie that besyde the probacyon of this forsayd {pro}posicyon / they open the misterie of all our mater to them that haue eyen to see. For. s. Austyn sayeth that we and y• olde faders do dif¦fer as touchynge the bodely meate for they eate māna / and we bred / but albeit yt varyed in the outeward apperance / yet neverthelesse spn̄ally yt did signyfye one thynge. For bothe the man¦na and bred do signifie christe. And so both they and we do eate one spūall meate / that ys to saye
we bothe eate the thynge wc ignyfieth & rep̄sen¦teth vno vs the verye one spūall meate o our foules wc ys christe. And beda doth playnly call both the manna and the brede signes / saynge be holde that the sygnes are atered and yet the fayth abydeth one Now yf they be signs / thā they do signifie and are not the very thynge yt sellffe wc they do sygnifye for the igne o a thin¦ge defferenth from the thynge yt sef wc yt doth signifie ād rep̄sent As the ale poleys not the ae yt sellfe wc yt dothe signifie or represen. Here thou wylt obiecte agaynste me that yf this faith be sufficient what nedeth the institucyon of a sacrament? I answer that sacramētes are insi¦tuted for .iij. causes? The firste ys assygned of. s. Austyn which fayth on this maner.Aug. con¦tra Fastum Li 19. cap.  In nullum autē nomen religionis, seu verū, seu falsum, coagu lari homines possunt, nisi signaculorū seu sacramē¦torum visibiliū consortio colligantur, quorū sacra∣mentorum uis inenarrabiliter ualet plurimum & ideo contempta sacrilegos facit. Impie quippe con∣tēnitur sine qua perfici nō potest pietas. That ys to saye men can not be ioyned in to any kynde / of religion whether yt be trew or fase except they be knyt in felowshyp by som viible toke∣nes or sacramentes the power of which sacramē¦tes ys of suche efficacite / that can not be exprs¦sed. And therfor yt makyth them that dispice yt to be abhorred / for yt ys wickydnes to despi¦ce that thynge wt oute which godlines can not be brought to passe Thus yt aperith that neces¦site ys the first cause. For ther can no cōgrega¦cyō be severed oute of the multitude of men but
they mute nedes haue a signe token sacrament or comen badge by the wc they may knowe eche other. And ther ys no defference betwene a sig∣ne or a badge and a sacramēt / but that the sacra¦ment sygnifyeth an̄ holy thinge and a signe or a badge dothe signyie a wordly thinge as.Augusti. ad Mar∣celln 2 s. Au¦stē ayeth / signes whē they are referred to holy thīges are called sacramētes. The secōde cause of their institucyon ys / that they may be a mea¦ne to brynge vs vnto hys fayth and to enprent yt the de{per} in vs / for yt doth costomably the mo¦re move a man to beleve / whē he {per}ceyvyth the thynge expressed to diuerse senses at once / as by exāple / yf I promise a man to mete hym at a day apoynted / he wyll somwhat truste my wor¦de. Notwtstondynge he trustyth not so moche vnto yt / as yf I did both promise hym with my worde & allso clape handes wt hym or holde vp my fynger / for he counteth that this promiseys strong & more faythefull then ys the bare wor∣de / because yt moveth mo senses. For the wor∣de doth but only certifie the thynge vnto a man by the sense of herynge / but whē wt my promise immediatly after I holde vp my fynger / then do I not only certifye hym by the sense of hea∣rynge: But allso b hys sight / he perceyvyth that that facte confyrmeth my worde. And in the clapynge of handes he perceyvyth both by hys sight and fealyng (be side the word) that I wyll fullfyll my promise. And lykewise yt ys in this sacramente Christ promised them / that he wolde geve hys bodye to be slayne for their syn¦nes. And for to establishe the faythe of this pro¦mise
in them / he did institute the sacramēt wc he called hys bodye / to thentent that the very na∣me yt selfe might put them in remmbrāce what was ment by yt / he brake the brode before them signifying vnto thē outwardly / evyn the same thynge / that he by his wordes hade before {pro}te¦sted & evyn as his wordes hade enformed thē by their hearynge / that he entended so to do so the brekynge of that brede enformed their ye sight that he wolde fullfyll hys promise. Then he di¦de distribute yt amonge thē to enprynt the ma¦ter more depely in them / signifinig therbye that evyn as that brede was devidid amonge them / so should hys bodie and frute of his passyon be distributed vnto as manye as beleved his wor¦des. Finaly he caused them o eate yt / that no∣thynge shoulde be lackynge to cōfyrme that ne¦cessarye poynt of faythe in thē / signifyinge ther¦bye that as verely as they fellte that brede wtin them / so sure should they be of hys bodye thor∣ough fayth. And that evyn as that brede doth norishe te bodye so dothe the fayth in hys bo∣dye breakynge norishe the soule vnto ever la¦stynge lyffe. This did o{ur} mercyfull savio{ur} (wc knowyth o{ur} fraylte & weakenes) to establishe ād strenghth their fath in hys bodye breakynge & blode shedynge wc ys o{ur} shoteanker and laste refuge wt oute wc we shoulde all perishe. The thrd cause the insttucyon & profit that comy¦the of yt ys this. They that haue receyved thes blessyd tidynges and worde of helth / do love to publishe this felicite vnto other men. And to geve thākys before the face of the congregacyō
vnto their bountteons benefactour / and as mo¦che as in them ys / to drawe all people to the prai¦singe of God with them / which thinge though yt be partly dō by the prechynge of goddes wor¦de & fructefull exhortacyons / yet dothe that visi¦ble token & sacramente (yf a man vnderstond what ys ment therbye) more effectuously worke in them both fayth and thankisgeuynge / then doth the bare worde / but yf a man wot not what yt meaneth / and seketh helthe in the sacrament and outeward signe / then may he well be lyke∣ned vnto a fonde fellow / which when he ys ve∣ry drye / and an honest man shewe hym an ale∣pole & tell hym that ther ys good ale ynough / wolde goo and sucke the ale pole / trustynge to get drynke oute of yt / and so to quenche hys thurste. Now a wise man wyll tell hym that he playeth the fole for the ale pole doth but signi∣fie that ther ys good ale in the howse / where the alepole stondyth and wyll tell hym that he must goo nere the howse / and there he shall fynde the drynke / & not stond suckynge the alepole in vay¦ne. For yt shall not ease hym but rather make hym more drie for the ale pole doth signifie good ale: yet the ale pole yt sellfe ys no good ale / no¦ther ys there ony good ale in the alepole. And lykewise yt ys in all sacramentes. For yf we vndersond not what they meane / and seke helth in the outeward signe: then we sucke the alepo¦le & labour in vayne. But yf we do vnder∣stond the meanynge of them / than shall we seke what they signifye / and go to the signyficacions & ther shall we fynde vndoubted helth. As to
oure purpose in thys sacrament wherof we spe¦ake / we muste note what yt signyfyeth / and ther shall we fynde oure redempcyon. It sig¦nifyeth that Christys bodye was broken vp∣pon the crosse to redeme vs from the thrauldom of the deuell / and that hys blode was shed for vs to washe oure synnes. Therfore we mste rū¦ne thider yf we wyll be eased. For yf we thyn∣ke to haue our synnes forgeuyn / for eatynge of the sacrament / or for seinge the sacrament one∣ce a day / or for prayinge vnto yt: then suerly we sucke the alepole. And of thys yow may perceyue what profyt comyth of thes sacramen¦tes the which ether haue no signyficacyons put vnto them or els when ther sygnifycacions ar loste and forgotten. For then no doubt they are not commended of God / but are rather ab∣homynable / for whan we knowe not what they meane / then seke we helth in the outward dede / and so are iniuryous vnto Christe and hys blo¦de. As by example / the sacrifices of the Iewys were well alowed & accepted of God as longe as they vsed them aryght and vnderstode by them the deth of Chryste / the shedynge of hys bloude & that holy oblacyon offered on the crosse once for euer.

Thys can∣ker then began to sprede in the congrigacyon / and did full sore noy the bodie / in so moche that with in .iiii.C. yere there were very many se∣ctes scatered in euery cost.

Before that time ther was no bishope greadye to take a cure. For yt was non honour and profit as yt ys now / but only a refull charge which was like to cost hym his

But after that yt was made so honorable and profitable / they that were worste bothe in lerynge and euyn∣ge / moste labored for yt. For they that wre ver¦tuous wolde not entangle them sellffys with the vayne pryde of thys worlde / and weare .iij.Mat. 7.

MoreTeacheth in a fewe leeues shortly all the poy¦son that wycliff / huskyn / Tendae ād Zwyngi¦us haue taught in all their bokes before. C̄cer¦ninge the blessed sacrament of the aulter: not on¦ly affyrmyng yt to be very bredde styll (as Lu∣ther doth) but allso (as thes other beastes doo) saeth yt ys nothyng els. And after the same ser Thomas more sayeth. Thes dregges hathe he dronkyn of Wiclyff / Eolampadius / Tendale / and Zwinglius / and so hathe he all that he ar∣gueth here beside / whiche .iiij what maner folke they be ys metely well perceyuyd and knowyn / and God hathe in parte / with hys open vengā¦ce declared. Fryth.Luther ys not the prycke that I rūne at / but the scripture of God I do nether affyrme nor de¦nye any thing because Luther so sayeth: but be¦cause the scrypture of God doth so conclude & determe I take not Luther for soche an auctour that I thynke he can not erre / but I thynke ve¦rely that he both may erre and dothe erre in cer¦tayne poyntes allthough not in suche as concer¦ne saluayon and dampnacyon / for in thes (bles¦sed be God) all thes whom ye call heretykys do agre ryght well. And lykewise I do not alowe this thinge because Wyclyfe / Oecolampadius Tendale & Zwinglius so saye / but because I see
them in that place more purely expoūde the scri¦pture / and that the processe of the text do thom¦re fauour their sentence. And wher yow saye that I affyrme yt to be bred styll as Luther doth / the same I say agay¦ne / not because Luther so saythe / but because I can proue my wordes true by scrypture / reason of nature / ād doctours. Paulle calleth yt brede saynge:1 Cor. 10. the brede wc we breake / ys yt not the fe¦lowship of the bodye of christe? For we though we be manye / are yet one bodye and one brede: as manye as are pertakers of one brede. And agayne he sayeth / asoftyn as ye eate of this bre¦de / or drinke of this cuppe / yow shall shewe the lordes deth vntyll he cōme.1. Cor. 11. Allso luke caulleth yt brede in the actes saying:Actuū. 2 they cōtinued in the felowshyp of the apostylles and in breakinge of brede / and in prayer.Luc. 22. Allso Christe caulyd the cuppe / the frute of vyne sayinge / I shall not frō hence forthe dryncke of the frute of the vyne / vntyll I drynke that newe in the kyngdom of my father Furthermore nature doth teache yow that both the brede and wyne cōtynewe in their nature, For the brede mouleth yf yt be kepte lō¦ge / ye and wurmes brede in yt. And the poore mouse wyll ronne awaye wt yt / and deyre no nother meate to herdynner / whiche are euident ynough that there remayneth brede. Allso the wyne yf yt were reseruyd wold wex souer as they confesse them selues / and therfore they hou¦sell the laye people but wt one kynde only / becau¦se the wyne can not continue nor be reserued / to haue ready at hande when nede were. And sure¦ly
as yf ther remayned no brede yt coulde not mould nor wex full of wormes. Euyn so yf ther remayned no wyne / yt coulde not wex sower / and therfore yt ys but faulse doctryne / that our prelates so longe haue puplyshed. Finally that there remaynethe bred might be proued by the auctorite of many doctours / which caule yt bred and wyne / as Christ and his apostels did. And though some sophysters wolde wreast their say¦ings and expound them after their phanta∣sie / yet shall I allege them one doctour (which was allso pope of Rome) that makyth so play∣ne with vs that they shalbe compelled with sha¦me to holde their tonges. For pope Gelasius wryteth on this maner. Certe sacramenta que. su∣mimus corporiset sanguinis hristi diuinae ressun & propterea per illa, participes facti sumus diuinae naturae, & tamen non deinit esse substantia uel pa¦nis & uini, sed permanent in suae proprietati natu¦rae. Et certe imago & similitudo corporis & san∣guinis christi in actione misteriorum celebrantur. That ys to saye / suery the sacramentes of the bodye and bloude of Christe / are a godly thyn∣ge / and therfore thorough them are we made par¦takers of the Godly nature / And yet doth yt not cease to be the substaunce / or nature of bred and wyne / but they cotynewe in the proper∣tye of ther owyn nature. And suerly the Ima¦ge and similitude of the bodye of blode ād chri¦ste are celebrated in the acte of the mysteries? Thys I am sure was the olde doctryne which they can not auoyde. And therfor with the scrypture / nature / and fathers / I wyll conclu∣de
that there remayneth the substaunce and na∣ture of brede and wyne. And where ye saye that we affyrme yt to be nothing els I dare saye that ye vntruly re¦port on vs all.More. And here after I wyll shewe yow what yt ys more thn brede. And where ye saye that yt ys metely well knowyn what maner of folke they be / and that GOD hath in parte wyth hys open vengeaunce decla∣red. I answer that master WycleffWicliffe. was noted while he was liuyng / to be a man not only of moste famous doctryne / but allso of a very sen∣cere lyff & conuersacyon. Neuerthelesse to de∣clare your malicyous myndes & vengeable har¦tes (as men say) .xv. yere after he was buryed / yow toke hym vp and brunt hym / whiche facte declared youre furye / allthough he fete no fierMath. 1 but blessed be GOD whyche hathe guyn su∣che tyrantes no further power / but ouer thys corruptible bodye.

And as for OecolampadiusEcolam∣padius. / whom yow allso calle huskyn / hys mose aduersaries haue euer commended hys conuersacion / and Godly lyff / which when God had appoyted hys ty∣me / gaue place vnto mature (as euery man mu¦ste) and died of a canker. And TyndaleTindale I truste leuyth / well cōtent with suche a poore apostylis lyffe / as god gaue hys sone christe / and hys faythfull ministers in this worlde wc ys not sure of so many mies / as

I receyuyd a leter from hym  wc was wrytyn sys rystmas whe¦rin amonge other maters he wrytyth thus. I cal¦le God to record agaynst the day we shall apere before o{ur} lorde Iesus to geue a reconynge of our doynges / that I never altered one sillable of god¦des worde / agaynst my conscyence nor wolde do this daye  yf all that ys in yerth  whether yt be honour / pleasure or rychis / mighte be geuyn me Moreouer I take God to record to my cōscien¦ce that I desyre of God to my sellf in this world no more hen that wt oute wc I can not kepe his laws &c, Iudge Christen reader whether thes wordes be not spoken of a faythfull / lere inno¦cent harte. And as for hys behauyour ys suche that I am sure no man can reproue hym of / any synne  howbe yt no mā ys innocent before god which beholdeth the harte. Zwng∣lius.Finallye Zwinglius was a man of suche ler∣nyng and grauite (beside eloquence) that I thin¦ke / noman in christindom myght haue cōpared wt hym not withstondynge he was slayne in ba∣tayle in defendynge hys cytye / and comē welth agaynste the assaute of wycked enemyes / wc cau¦se was moste ryghtwyse. And yf his mastership meane that / that was the vengeaunc of God / and declared hym to be an euyll parson because he was slayne. I may say nay / and shewe euidēt examples of the contrarie / for somtyme god ge∣vyth the victorye agaynst them that haue mo∣ste
rygtuouse cause / as yt is evydēt in the boke of IudicūIudicum 20. / whr all the chyldern of ysraell were gathered to gether to punyshe the shamfull zo¦domitrye of te trybe of bniamyn / which were in nombre but .2 thousand And the Israeltes were .cccc. thousand fygtinig men / wc came in to Silo / ād asked of god who shulde be ther cap¦taigne agaynst beniamyn. And they beinge but xxv: thousand slew of the other Israelites .12, thousand in one day: Then fledde the chyldern of Isarell vnto the lorde in Silo ād made gre¦at lamentacyon before hym evyn vntyll nyght And asked hym counsell sayinge: shall we goo a¦ny more to fyght agaynste the trybe of beniamī our brethern or not? God sayd vnto thē yes / goo vp and fyght agaynste thē. Then wēt they the next day and faught agaynst them / and the¦re were slaine agayne of the Israelites .18. thou∣sand men: Then came they backe agayne vnto the house of god / and sat downe and wepte be∣fore the lorde and fasted that day vntyll evyn and asked hym agayne / whether they shulde any more fight agaynst theyr brethern or not. God sayd vnto thē yes  to morow I will deliuer thē in to yo{ur} hādes. And the nxt day was the trybe of beniamin vtterly distroyed / sauyng .600. men whych hyd them selves in the wildernes. Here yt ys evydent that the chylderne of Israell lo∣ste the victorye twise and yet not with sonding had a iue cause / and faught at goddes comman¦dement. Besides that / Iudas machabeus / was slayne / in a ryghtwyse cause / as yt ys manyfest in the fyrst boke of the Machabes1. Macha¦beorum.  And therfo¦re
yt can be no euydent argument of the ven∣gaunce of GOD / that he was slayne in ba∣ayle in a ryghtwise cause / and therfore me thin¦keth that this man ys to malaparte so bluntly to enter in to Goddes Iudgment / and geue sen¦tence in that mater before he be caulled to coun¦sell. Thus aue I sufficiently touched hys preface / for those pointes that e afterward tou¦ched more largly / haue I wyllyngly passed be cause I shall touche thm rnestly here after. Nowe lett vs se what he proueth. Master More¶It ys a great wonder to see vppon how light & sleight occasions / he ys fallen vnto thes abhomynable heresyes or he deyeth not nor can not say nay  but that our sauyour sayd him selfe my fleshe ys verely meae and my blode ys verely rynke / he denyeth not allso that Christ hym sellfe at hys last souper / taynge the brde in to hys blessed handes / after that he had bles∣sd yt sayd vnto hs disciples Take yow thys and eate yt / thys ys my bodye  that shalbe ge∣uyn for yow. And lykewise gaue them the cha¦lece after hys blessyng and consecracyon / and sayd vnto them / thys ys the chalice of my blou¦de of the new testament / whyche shalbe shed oute for many / do ye thys yn remembrance of me. Frith¶It ys a great wounder to see howe ygno¦raunt theyr proctour ys / in the playne textes of scrypture. For yf he had any Iudgement at all he might well perceyue that when Chry∣ste spake thes wordes / my fleshe ys verely mea∣te and my bloude ys verely drynke / he spake no¦thynge
of the sacrament. For yt was not insti¦tute vntyll hys laste souper. And these wordes were spokyn to the Iewys longe before / and mēt thē not of the carnall eatynge or drynkyn¦ge of hys bodye or bloude / but of the spirituall atynge / which is done by faythe ād not with tothe / or / bellye. Wher of Saint Austyn sayeth vppō this gospell of Iohn̄ whi preparest thou other tothe or bellye beleue and thou haste ea∣tyn hym. So that chrystys wordes mut here be vnderstonde spiritualy. And that he cauleth hys fleshe very meat because that as meate by the eatyng of yt and disgestyng yt in our bo∣dye dothe strengthen thes corruptyble mem∣bres / so lykewise doth christes feshe by the be∣luynge that yt taketh our synne vppō yt selfe ād suffered the dth to delyuer vs ād strengthē our immortall soule. And lykewise as drynke when yt ys dronkyn / doth comforte and quic∣kyn our fraye nature / So lykewise doth Chri¦stes bloude by the drynkinge of yt in to the bou¦wells of our sole that ys by the beleuyng and remmbryng that yt ys shed or oure syn¦nes / comforte and quicken our soule vnto e∣uerlastyng lyffe. And this ys the eatyng and drynkyng that he speakyth of in that place. And that yt ys so yow may perceyue by the text followyng which sayth / he that eatyth my bodie ād drynketh my bloude dwellyth in me ād I in hym / which ys not possible to be vndersonden of the sacramēt For it is fals to say that he that eateth the sacramēt of his bodye and drynketh the sacramēt of hys bloude / dwelleth in christe
& christ in hym. For some man recyueth yt vn¦to his condempnacion / And thus doth S. Au∣sten expound yt saying, Hoc est enim Christum manducare, in illo manere, & illum manentem inse¦aere. This ys the very eatinge of Christ to dwell in hym and to haue hym dwelling in vs / So that who so euer dwellith in Christ (that ys to saye beleueth that he is sent of God to sa¦ue vs from our sinnes) doth verely eate & drin¦ke his bodie and bloude although he neuer re¦ceyued the sacrament. This is the spūall aing necessarie for all that shalbe saued for there is no man that mith to God wtote this eating of Christ / that is the bleuing in hym. And so I deney ot but that Christ speaketh thes words but surelye he ment spiritually  as. s. Austen de¦clareth / and as the place playnly proueth. Math. 26And as touching the other words that Chri¦ste spake vnto his disciples at the laste sou{per} / I deney not but that he sayd so but that he so fle¦sly ment as ye falsely faine / I vtterley deney. For I saye that his wordes wre then allso spri¦te and liff / and were spiritually to be vnderstō¦den / and that he called yt his bodie.Ioan. 6. Ioan. 15. For a certai¦ne propartie / euyn as he clled him self a vry vine / and his disciples very vine braunches / ād Ioan. 10.as he called him sellffe a doremot that he was so in dede  but for certayne propertes n the smi¦litudes / as a man for some pro{per}tie saieth of his negbours horsse / this horsse is myn vp & dow¦ne / meaning that yt is in euery thinge so lyke.Gene. 35. Gene. 32. And lyke as Iaob buylded an̄ aulter and caul¦led yt the God of Israell / and as Iacob called
the place where he wrasteled wt the angell / the fa¦ce of god / and as the pascal lābe was caulled the passing bye of the lorde.Ezeche. 5. And as a brokyn pot∣sherd was caulled Hierusalem not for that they were so in dede / but for certayne similitudes in the properties / and that the very name yt selfe might put men in remembrance what ys mnt by the thing / as I suffeciently declared in my fiste treatise. He muste nedes confesse / that they ha beleueMore that yt is the very bodie and his very bloude in dede / haue the playne wordes of o{ur} sauio{ur} hym sellfe vppon ther syde for the groūde and foun∣dacon of ther fayth. That is very true and so haue they the veryFyth. wordes of god / which saye a brokē pottsherd ys Hierusalem / and that Christe is a stone / ād that Christe is a vine and a dore. And yett yff they should beleue or think that he were in dede any of thesse things / they were neuerthelesse decey¦ued. For though he so sayd / yet I saye his wor¦des were spirituall & spiritually to be vnderstōd And were yow saye that I flye from the fay∣theMore of playne and open scriptures / and for the allygorie destroie the true sence of the letter. I answer that some textes of scripture are on¦lye to be vnderstonden after the letter:Fryth As whē Paulle sayth / Christ died for our synnes and a¦rose agayne for our iustification.Roma. 4. And some tex¦tes are only to be vnderstond spūally or in the waye of an allegorye:Corin. x. As when Paule sayeth / Christe was the stone / and when Christe saythIoh. x. Ioh . hym sellfe / I am a very vyne I am the doore /
and some muste be vnderstond both literalye / & spiritualie: As when God sayd / oute of egipte called I my sonne / whiche allthough it were lite¦ralye Ozee. 11fulfillyd in the childern of Israell when he brought them oute of Egipte with great po¦wer and wonders  yet was yt allso ment and ve¦rified in Christ hymsellfe / hys very spirituall sonne / which was caulled oute of Egipt after the deth of Herod.Math.  And agayne yt is very spūal¦ly fulfild in vs whiche thorou Christes blode are deliuered from the Egipt of synne / and from the power of Parro the deuyll, An I say that this text of scripture? This ys my bodie / ys on¦ly spūally to be vnderstondē  and not literalie And that doth S. Austen allso cōfirme / wc wry¦teth vnto adamantus & sayth Thes sentenses of scripture / christ was the one / The bloude ys the soule / and this ys my bodie are figuratiue¦lie to be vnderstōden (that ys to say spūally or by the way of an allegorie) and thus haue I S. Austen whollie on my side / whiche thinge shall yet here after more playnly apere. MoreNowe his exāple of his bridgromes ring I ve¦ry well a lowe / for I take the blessed sacramēt to be left wt vs for a very tokē & a memoriall of chri¦ste in dede. But I say that the hole substance of the same tokē & memoriall / is his owyn blessed bodie. And so I saye that christe hathe lefte vs a better tokyn then this mā wolde haue vs take yt for. And therin he fareth like a mā / to whō a bridgrome had deliuered a goodlye golde ringe wt a riche rubie therin / to deliuer to his bryde for a token. And then he wolde like a faulse shre¦we
/ kepe awaye that golde ring / and geue the bri¦de in stede therof / a proper ringe of a rishe / and tell hyr that the bridgrō wolde sende hyr no bet¦ter. Or els like one that when the bridgrom ha∣de geuyn soche a ring of golde to his bride for a token / wyll tell her playne / and make hyr beleue that the ringe were but coper or brasse / to mini∣she the bridgromes thanke. ¶ I am right glad that ye admit teth myn exā¦pleFryth / and graunte that the sacrament ys left to be a very token and a memoriall of Christe in de¦de. But where you saye / that the hole substan¦ce of the sam token and memoryall ys hys o∣wyn blessed bodye / that ys soner sayd than pro∣ued. For Saynt Austen shewyth the contra¦ry / as yt is partelye before touched / and here af¦ter shalbe dclared more playnlye. And where yow saye that we fare lyke a faulse shrew that wolde kepe the gold ringe from the bride / and ge¦ue hyr a ringe of a rishe / or tell hyr that hyr gol¦de ringe were co{per} or brasse / to minishe the brid¦gromes thanke. I answer that we denye not but that the ringe ys moste fine gold / and is sett wih as ryche Rubyes as can be gotton. For that ringe (I meane the sacrament) ys not on∣l a moste parfayte tokyn and a memoryall of they brydgromes benefytes and vnfayned fa∣uour on hys partye but yt is allso on the other partye eucharistye:Euchari¦stia. that ys to saye / a thankes geuynge / for the gracyous gyftes which she vn¦doubtedly knowelegeth her sellf to haue recey∣ued. For as verely as that bred ys broken amō¦ge them / so verely was Christes bodye brokyn
for ther synnes. And as verly as they receyue that brede in to ther bellye thorough eatinge yt so vereye do they receyue the frute of his deth in to ther soulys by beleuinge in hym And ther¦fore they assemle to that so{per} / not for the valu¦re of the bred  wyne or meate that ys ther eatin but for thentent to geue / hym thankes commen∣lye amonge them all / for hys iestmabe good∣nes. But to procede vnto oure purposse yt a mā wolde cōme vnto the bryde / & tell hyr that tis goodly gold ringe were her owyn brydgrome / both fleshe bloude and bones (as you doo) then I thyke yf she haue any wyt / she might an∣swer hym / that he mocked and the more he sayd yt the lesse she might beeue hym  and saye that yf that were her owyn brydgroe / what shulde she then nede any remembraunce of hym or why shoulde he geue yt her for a remembrāe? For a remembrāce p̄suposeth the thynge to be abset / and therfore yf this be a remembrance of hym / tan can he no here be present.ore I meruell me therfore moche / that he ys not a¦ferde to affirme that thes wordes of Christe / of hys bodie and of his bloude muste nedes be vn¦derstond by waye of a similitude or an allegorye as the wordes be of the vyne and the doore. No¦we this he wottes well / that though some wor∣ds spokyn by the mouthe of Christ e to be vn¦derstonden only by way of a similitude or an al∣legorye / yet followyth yt not ther vppon / that euery lke worde of christe in other places was non other but an allegorie / for suche was the shyfte and cauillacion that the wycked arrians
vsed wc toke from Christes parson his omnipo¦tent godhed. I graunt that the Arrians erred / for as ma∣sterFrith More sayth / though in some place a worde be taken figuratifey / yt followyth not therfore in euery other place / yt shulde likewise be takē But one questyon muste  aske hys mastership how dothe he knowe that ther ys any worde or text in scripture that muste be taken figuratue∣ly / that ys by the waye of a similitude or as he cauleth yt a necessarie allegorie? I thīke (though some men may assygne other good causes & eui∣dences) that the first knowelege ys by other tex¦tes of scrpture. For yf other textes be confer∣red vnto yt  and wyll not stonde wt the literall sence / then I thynke yt muste nedes be takē spi¦ritual or figuratiuelie as ther are infinite tex¦tes in scripture. Now when I see that S. Tho¦mas wt felt Christe his wondes & put his fyn∣ger in hys syde / called hym hys lorde ad god / and that no txt in scripture repungneth vnto the same / but that they may well tond to gether me thynketh yt were folye to affirme that thys word / god / in that text shulde be taken figurati¦uely or by waye of an allegorye: But nowe in o{ur} mater the processe of scripture wyll not sonde with the literall sense / as shall here after apere / And therfore necessite cōpellthe vs to expoun∣de yt figuratiuelye / as doth allso. S. Austen & other holy doctors / as here after shall playnly apere. If euery man that can finde out a newe fon∣deMor. phantase vppon a text of holy scripture / may
haue his owyn minde taken / & his owyn exposi¦ciō beleued agaynst the exposciōs of the old co¦ninge doctors & sayntes / then may you surely see that non article of the christen fayth / can stō¦de & endure lōge. And then he allegith. s. Hierom wc sayeth / that yf the eposiō of other interpre¦tours / ād the cōsent of the cōmen catholike chur¦che / wre of no more strēgth / but that euery mā might be beleud that coulde binge som textes of scripture / for hm expounded as yt pleassed hm self / then coulde I (sayte thys holy man) brynge vppe a new sect allso / and saye by scry∣pture  that no man were a true Chrysten man nor a mmbr of the churche  that kepeth two cotes. And in good fayt (sayth master More) f that wae were owd / I were able my sll¦fe to fynde oute fyftene newe sectes in one fo∣re none. Sayncte Peter sath that the scripture ys not expounded after the appetyte of any priua∣te person / but uyn as yt was geuyn / by the spri¦te of god & no by mannes wyll / So mste yt be declared by the same spryte. And therfore I wyll not that any man salbe beleued / by brin∣ginge hys owyn mynde and phantasie. But yf he wyll be beleued / lett hym brynge eyther an other playne texte / which shall expounde the fir¦ste / or els at the leste he muste bringe suche a sen¦tense / as wyll stonde with the processe of the scrypture. Whye was Saynct Hierom alo∣wd agaynst the determnacyon of the counsell of meldelcy / syth he was alone / and they a great multitude but onlye be cause he brought euy∣dent
scrypture / which at the tyme of their sen∣tense / non of them remembred: and yet when yt was brought / they coulde not auoyde yt. And lykewise except I brynge euydent scrypture which they all shall expounde as I doo / I de∣syre not to be beleued. And where master Mo¦re sayeth / that in good fayth he wre able to yn¦de oute fyftene newe sectes in one sore none / he may thanke GOD that he hathe suche a prengant wytte: But yet I truste he shul∣de not fynde one (yf there were any parll of dampnacyon therin) but that we wolde with a playne texte confute yt / which he shuld not be a¦ble to auoyde. ¶And ouer this the very circumstances ofMore the places in the gospell in which our sauyour speaketh of that sacrament / may well make o∣pen the defference of hys speache in this mater and of all those other / and that as he spake all those but in an allegorye / so spake he ys pla¦ynly meaninge that he spake of hys very bodye and hys very bloud / besyde all allgoryes. For when our lorde sayd / he was a very vyne / nor when he sayd he was the dore / there was non that harde hym / that any thynge merue∣lyd therof. And whye? For be cause they per¦ceyued well / that he ment not that he was a ma¦teryall vyne in dede / nor a dore nether: But when he sayd that hys fleshe was very meate / and hys bloude very drynke / and that they shuld not be saued / but yf they did eate hys fle∣she and drynke hys bloude / then were thy all in suche a wonder therof / that they coulde not
they coulde not abyde. And whrfore / but becau¦se they perceyued well by hys wordes and hys maner of cirunstaunces / that Criste spake of hys very flese and hys very bloude in dede? FritIt ys openly knowen & confessed amonge all lerned men tat in the .6. chapitre of IoāIoan. 6. / chri¦ste spake not one worde concernynge the sacra∣cramēt of hys bodye and bloude (wc at that tyme was not yet institute) but all that he ther spake was of the sp̄all eatinge & drinkynge of his bo¦te / & bloude / in to o{ur} soule wc ys the fayte in hs bodye / and bloude / as I haue touched be∣fore. And the cycunstances of this place do n dede proue that they were fleshly mynded / and vnderstoe not the spirituall wordes of our sa∣vio{ur} Christ / and thefore wondered & murmered In somoch that Christ sayd vnto thē / doth this ofende o? What wl ye say then whē ye shall see the sone of man ascendynge thither where he was before? Then (addeth S. Austen) you sall knowe tat he ment not to geue hys fleshe to ea¦te wt youre teth: for he shall ascende hoole. And Christ addeth  yt ys the spirete that quickneth the fleshe profiteth notnge / the word / that I speak / are spiret ād lyste: that ys to saye / saith S. Austyn / are spūaly to be vnderstond. And where Christ sayeth  that the fleshe profiteth no¦thyng (meanyng of hys owne fleshe / as S Au∣sten sayth) he maneth that yt profitth not as they vnderstode hm that ys to saye / yt profi∣teth not / yf t were eatē, But yt doth moche {pro}fi¦te to be slayne / that thorough yt and the shedīge of hys bloude / the wathe of god o{ur} father ys pa¦cified
/ and oure synns for geuē. And wher his mastership saythe / that the people {per}ceyed well what he ment / and therfore wōdred so sore and coude not abyde / be cause they perceyued well by his wordes and maner of circunstāces what his meaning wa. I wyll saye as I did before / that they vndrsode hm not. Fowe here he will saye vnto me / yf yt be but yo{ur} naye and my yee / then I wolde thynke to be beleued as soe as yow / and surelye that were but reson. ot wtstondyng (thāks be to god) I am able to brin¦ge in auctorite to Iudge btwene vs bothe who¦se Iudgement I truste his mastership wyll ad¦myt.Augusti. in sermo. ad infan. This auctor ys. S. Ausyn wc sayeth. Disi¦puli en eius qui eum sequebantur expauerunt & exhorruerunt sermonē nō intellegentes. That ys to saye his disciples wc olowed hym / were a stoyned / and abhorred his wordes and vndersto¦de them not. And be cause yo{ur} masershipe shall ot thynke that he ouer schott hym selfe / and spake he wyst not what we shall aliege hym say¦tnge the same wordes in an other placeAugu.  Cum di¦ceret. Nisi quis manducauerit carnem. &c. Illi non intellegentes dixerunt ad inuicem. Durus est hic ser¦mo, quis potest eum audire? That ys when christ sayd / except a man eate my fleshe and drinke my bloude  he shall haue no lyff in hym / they beau¦s thy vderstode hym not / sayde to eche other this ys an harde sayinge / who can heare hym? Thus I trust you will geue place (allthough not to me) yet at the lest vnto. S. Austen / and receye the trueth wc ys so playnly proued. And where his mastership alleget this text
for the sacrament / that except they did eate his fleshe & drynke his bloude they could not be sa¦ued yt semeth that he ys fallē in to the erro{ur} of pope innocēt  whiche like wise vnderstondyng this text vppon the sacramēt (as master More doth) caused yōge chyldern & infantes to receiue the sacramēt  as though thei had all by a dāpned wc died & had not receyued yt. And of this car∣nall minde were many mo Bushoppes a great while (as are now the bohemes  whom he after disprayseth and yet expoūdeth the text as they doo but afterward they loked more spūally vp¦po the matter and cōfessed ther ignorāce (as I truste master more wyll) but nowe will I shew you. s. Austēs minde vppō this text wc shall hl∣pe for the exposiciō of all this matter s. Austē in the thirde boke de doctrina christiana the .16. cha¦pitre teachīge howe we shall knowe the tropes figures / allegories and phrases of the scripture saith.Augusti¦nus libro 3. de doctri¦na Chri∣sia. Si aūt flagitiū aut facinus iubere uidet, figu∣rata locutio est.

That ys to saye when so euer the scripture or Christ / se¦meth to cōmaunde any fowle or wicked thynge / than muste that text be takē figuratiuelye (that ys yt ys a phrase / allegorie / and maner of spea∣king / and muste be vnderstōd spūally & not af∣ter the letter). Except (sayth christ) ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of mā and drinke his bloude
ye shall haue no lyffe in you. He eamethe (saith S. Austen) to cōmaunde a fowle and a wycked thinge. It ys therfore a figure / commauding vs to be partakers of his passyon / and swely and {pro}fitablye to prent in oure mynde that hys fleshe was crucifyed and wonded for vs. This trueth thākes be to god / doth S. Austen decla¦re vnto vs / wc thinge beside the openīge of this text agaynst master mores mynde / doth playn∣lye shew what he thought in the wodes of chri¦stes souper. For syth he caued yt a sowe and a wicked thinge / to eate his fleshe / than may you sone {per}ceyue / that he thought yt as sowie ād as wicked a thinge / to eate his bodye / seinge hys bodie ys fleshe and then cōsquently yt shall fo¦lowe / that ether this worde ae (wher Christe sayd take this & eate yt) muste be takyn spūal∣ly / or els that this sayng of christe / this ys my bodie / muste be figuratiuely spoken / but thys worde eate ys takē after the lettr (or thei did in dede eate the bred) therfore yt muste nedes fo¦lowe / that this sentence (this ys my odie) mu¦ste be figuratiuely spoken, Or els ys. s. Austen not to be approued in this place / wt thynge our bushoppes I thynke / wyll not saye naye. Besydes that s. Austen sayeth.Augusti¦nus ī ser∣mone ad infantes. Quādo loque∣batur dn̄s noster Iesus Christus de corpore suo, nisi (inqt) qs māducauerit carnē mā et biberit sangui nē meū, non habeit in seuitā.

That ys to saye, whē o{ur} lorde Iesus Christe spake of his bodie / except (quod

Qui manducat car∣nem meam & bibit meum sanguinem in me ma∣net & ego in illo, Hoc est ergo māducare illā es am & illum bibere potum, in Christo manere & illum
manentem in se habere, ac per hoc qui nō manet in Christo & in quo non manet Christus procudubio non manducat eius carnem nec bibit sanguinē, etiā si tantae rei sacramentū ad iudicium sibi manduce & bibit That is to say / he that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my blode / abideth in me / and I in hym. This is therfore the eatinge of that mea∣te & drinkinge of that blode / to abyde in christ and haue him abiding in vs. And therfore he that abideth not in Christ / and in whom Christ abideth not / wt oute doubt he eateth not his fles∣he nor drinketh not hs bloude / although he ea¦te and drinke the sacrament of so great a thinge vnto his dāpnacion. And euyn the same wordes hath bede vppon the Corinthians. 1. Corin 10.Idem B¦da super Cor. 10. This one place is sufficient for to proue mi pur¦posse though he sayd not one worde more For he¦re he doth playnlye determin / that he wc abideth not in Christe: that is to saye: he that is wicked or vnfaythfull / doth not eate his fleshe nor drin¦ke his bloude / although he eate and drinke the sacramēt of so great a thinge. And so must yt ne¦des followe / that the sacrament yt not the verye naturall bodie of christe. For then the vnfayth¦full shuld eate his fleshe / seing he eateth the sa∣crament of his bodye. But that doth s. Austē de¦ney / wherfore yt muste nedes followe / that yt is but only a token of a remembrance / & a signe of his bodie breakinge / and a representaciō of his passiō / that we might kepe hys acte in memore / Roa. . & geue him thankes for his tender loue ād kinde¦nes / wt when we were his ennemies toke vppon him to suffer moste vile deth / to reconcile vs vn¦to

And in whom I abyde not / lett hī not saye or thinke that he eateth mi bodie or drīketh mi blode? They abyde not in Christ wc are not his membres. And they are not his mē∣bres wc make thē selues the membres of an har¦lete. And these are allso the very wordes of Be¦de.Beda su∣. 1. cor. 6. Here ys yt playne proued agayne by the au¦ctorite of s. Austen & Bede / that the wicked and vnfaythfull (wc are not the membres of Christ) do not eate his bodye nor drinke his blode / ād yet they do eate the sacrament as well as the o∣ther. Wherfore you muste nedes / graūt that the sacramēt ys not the naturall bodye of christ but a figure / tokē or memoriall therof. Nowe good christē people count not this new lerninge wc is firmed by suche olde doctors & faithfull fathers Nowe were this ynough for a Christen man that loued no cōtencyon. But because there are so many sophisters ī the world wc care not what they saye / so they hold not ther peace. I muste ne¦des sette som bulwarke by this holye doctoure to helpe to defende hym / for els they will short∣ly ouer rūne hym (as they do me) and make hym an hereyck to. Therfore I wyll allege hys ma¦ster s. Ambrose.Ambrosi.  sacra. Sainct Ambrose sayth. Nō iste

¶The mynde and exposicyon of the olde Doctours vppon the wordes of Christes maundey. More.ANd where Master More sayth / that yf Christe had not ment after the playne literall sense / that both the hearers at that tyme / and the expositors syns / & all Christen people beside this xv.c. yere wold not haue ta¦ken onlye the leterall sens being so straunge and merulous that yt might seame impossible / and decline from the letter for allegories in all suche other thinges beinge (as he saith) and as in dede they be / so manie ferre in noumbre moo. Fryth.As touchinge the hearers they were deceiued & vnderstod hym not (I meane as manye as to¦ke his wordes fleslye as you do) And they had ther answer of Christe (when they murmured) that hys wordes were sprite and lyffe: that ys (as. S. Austen sayeth) spiritually to be vnder¦stond and not fleslye / as ys before declared. And as for the expostours. I thynke he hath not one of the olde fathers for hym / but certen new fellowys: as Dominic. s. Thomas / Oam / and suche other wc haue made the pope a God. And as I haue shewed. s.

Sith that tyme I saye they haue made mē beleue what they lyst and made articles of the fayth at their pleasure One article muste be that they be the churche / & can not erre: And this ys the groūde of all their doctryne But the trueth of this article ys no∣we suffeciētly knowē. For yf quene katerine be kynge hēries wyffe / thē they do erre / & yf she be not / thē thei haue erred / to speake no more cruel lye: It ys nowe be cōe an article of o{ur} fayth that the pope of Rome muste be the hede of the chur¦che & the vicar of christe: & that bi goddes lawe. yt ys an article of o{ur} fayth that what so euer he byndeth in yerth / ys boūde in heuī / in so moche that yf he cue wrongfullye / yet ye muste be fea¦red
& infinite suche other wc are not ī o{ur} crede but blessed be god that hath geuē some light in to o{ur} prīces herte, For he hath latee putforth a boke called the glasse of trouth wc {pro}ueth many of thes articles verye folishe phātaies & that euyn by theyr owin docto{ur}s / ād so I truste you shabe {pro}¦ued ī this poīt of the sacramēt for though it be an article of o{ur} faith / yt is nō article of o{ur} crede in the .xij. articles wherof are sufficient for our saluatiō. And therfore we may thynke that you lye wt oute all Ieoperdye of dampnacyon. Neuerthelesse seinge his mastership saith that all make for him / ād I say clene cōtrarie / that all the olde fathers make agaynste hym / or at the lest wise not wt him / It were necessarie that one of vs shulde proue his purpose. But in ded in this poynt he wold loke to haue the v̄tayge of me. For he thinketh that men will soner beleue hym wc ys a great man / then me wc am but a poo¦re man / and that therfore I had more nede to proue my parte true / then he to proue his. Well I am content and therfore geue eare dere rea∣der and Iudge betwene vs. First I will begin wt Tertulian / because he is of moste antiqutetertulia∣nus libro 2. contra marcionē Tertullian saith. Ipse (Chri∣stus) nec panē reproauit qd ipsum corpus suū re∣presentat. That ys to saye. Christ him sellfe dyd not reproue or discōmende bred wt doth rep̄sent his very bodie. For the vnderstonding of thys place / you must knowe that there was an here∣ticke caulled marcion / wc did re{pro}ue creatures & said that all maner of creatures were euel This thinge doth Tertullyan improue by the sacra¦ment
and sayeth. Christ did not reproue or di∣scomende bred the which dooth represent his bo¦dye: as though he shoulde saye / yf christ had co¦unted the breed euell / then wolde he not haue lefte yt for a sacrament to represent hys bodye meanynge that yt ys a sacrament / signe / token and memoriall of hys bodye / and not the bodye yt sellf. And that this is his mynde / doth playn¦lye apere in hys fourth boke / wher he sayeth / Christus acceptū panē et distributū discipulis,Tertulia¦nus libr 4. contra marcionē cor∣pus suū illud fecit: hoc et corp{us} meū dicēdo, id est figura corpis mei Figura aūt nōfuisset, nisi verita¦tis esset corpus. Ceteru vacua res qdest phātasma, figurā capere nō posset That is to saye / christ ta∣kyng brede & distrybutynge vnto his disciples made it his bodie / sayng this ys my bodye: that ys to saye / a figure of mi bodye but this breed could not haue yn a figure of yt / except christ had had a true bodie For a uayne thīge or a phā¦tasye cā take no figure. For the vnderstōdynge of this place / you muste marke that this heretyc¦ke marcion against whō this auctour wryteth / did holde opinyon that christ had no naturall bodye / but onlye a phātasticall bodye ād this opinion doth this doctour improue bi the sacra¦mēt of the aulter sayinge: the sacramēt ys a figu¦re of his bodye: ergo Christ had a true bodye / & not a phantasticall bodie: For a uaine thīge or phaasie cā take no figure. Loo / here doth this olde father wc was lōge be fore s. autē: or s. hiero¦me / expoūde thes wordes of christe This is mi bo¦die: that is to saie / a figure of mi bodie therfore ye are to blāe to call it newe lerīge / Nowe be cause
thei shall not of temrarious p̄sumpcyon reiect this olde father / I shall establyshe hys wordes by s. Austen wc comendeth Christes meruelous pacince for suffering so longe that traiour Iu¦das / as though he had byn a good mā / and yet was not ignorāt of his wicked thoughtes.Augusti in prefa. Psalm.  Ad∣hibuit (inqt) ad cōuiiū in quo corporis & langus sui figurā discipulis cōmendauit ac tradidit. That ys to saye he admtted hm (sayehe s. Austen) vnto the mandye wherin he dede betake and de¦lyer vnto the discipls the figure of his bodie and bloude, Here doth his holye father. s. Au∣sten call yt the figur of hs bodye. And I am sure there is nomā so chyldishe / but that he kno¦weth that the figure of a thinge ys not the thin¦ge yt sellff. As by exāple the figure of Christe ys not Christe hym selfe / the figure of s. Pter ys not sant Peter hym sellf. And yet we do ne¦uerthelesse cōmenly call thosse figures by the na¦me of the thinge that they do rep̄sent. As I ma¦ye saye when I see the figure of. s. Peter. thys ys. s. Peer to whom Christe deliuered the key¦es of the kyndom of heuyn. And yet he were a fole that wold thinke that figure to be s. Pe∣ter hym self: for yt ys onlye a representacion of hym. Besides that. s. Austen sayth,Augustī. su{per} psal. 98. Non hoc cor¦pus quod uidetis estis manducaturi, nec ibituri illū sanguinē quē effusuri sunt qui me crucifigē. Sacra¦mentū aliqd uobis cōmendaui, spiritu-liter intelle¦cum uiuifica uos, caro aūt non prodest quicquam That ys to say you shall not ae thys bodye that you see / nor drinke that bloude wc thei that crucyfie me shall shed oute. I haue geuen a ser∣tayne
sacrament vnto you yf yt be spūally vn∣derstond / yt quickeneth you: but the fleshe pro¦fiteth nothinge. What thinges can be more pla∣ynly spoken? Furdermore S. Austen sayeth. Sepe ita loqui∣mur ut pascha appropinquā te crastinā uel perendi nā Dn̄i passionem dicamus: cū ille ante tam multo annos passus sit, nec omnino nisi semel illa passio fa¦cta sit. Nempe ipso die dn̄ico dicimus hodie Domi¦nus resurrexit, cū ex quo surrexit totanni trāsierūt Quare nemo tam ineptus est, ut nos ita loquentes ar¦guat esse mentitos, quia istos dies secundum illorū quibus haec gesta sunt similitudinē nuncupamus: ut dicatur ipse dies qui nō sit ipse, sed reuolutione temporum similes eius: & dicatur illo die fieri pro¦pter sacramenti celebrationē, quod non illo die, sed¦iam olim sactū est. Nōne semel immolatus est chri¦stus in seipso? & tamē in sacramento nō solum per annuas paschae solennitates, sed omnidie pro popu¦lis immolatur: nec uti{que} mentitur qui interrogatus, responderit eū immolari. Si enim sacramenta quā dam similitudinē earum rerū quarū sunt sacramen¦ta nō haberent, omnino sacramenta non essent Ex hac autē similitudine plerum{que} etiā ipsarū rerū no¦mina accipiūt. Sicut ergo seundū quendā modum sacramentum corporis CHRISTI corpus CHRISTI est, & sacramentū sanguinis CHRISTI sanguis CHRISTI est. Ita sacramenta fidei fides est, Nihil est autē aliud credere, q fidem habere, ac per hoc re¦spondetur fidē habere propter fidei sacramenta. Et cōuertere se ad Deū propter cōuersionis sacramen¦tū. Quia & ipsa responsio perinet ad celebrationem sacramenti. Sicut de ipso baptismo apostolus dicit.
consepulti (inquit) sumus Christo per baptismum in mortem, Non ait sepulturā significauimus, sed prorsus ait, consepulti sumus. Sacramentū ergo tan¦tae rei non nisi eiusdem rei uocabulo nuncupauit. That ys sae: We often vse to saye / when ester drawyth ney / that to morow or the next day is the Lordes passyon / and yett yt ys many yeres sith he suffered / and that passyon was neuer do∣ne but once. And vppon that sondaye we saye / ths daye the lorde did ryse agayne / and yet yt ys many yeres syns he rose / Now ys ther no man so folishe to reproue vs as lyars for sayin¦ge / be cause we name thes dayes after the simi∣litude of those in which thes thinges were don̄ so that yt ys cauied the same daye / which is not the verye same / but by the reuolucyon of tyme / lyke yt. And yt ys named to be don the same da¦ye thorough the celebracyon of the sacrament (thorough kepynge the memoryall of the thyng once don̄) which ys not don that daye / but was don longe agoon. Was not CHRIST onece crucyfyed in hys owne person? and yet in a mysterye (which ys the remembrance of hys verye passyon) he ys crucyfyed for the people not onlye euery feast of ester / but euery daye: ne¦ther doth he lye whych (when he ys asked) an∣swereth that he ys crucyfyed for yf the sacra¦mentes / had not certayne symilitudes of those thinges wherof they are sacramentes then shul¦de they be no sacramentes at all. And for thys symilitude for the moste parte they take the na¦mes of the very thinges and therfore as after a certayne maner the sacrament of Christys bo∣dye
ys Christis bodye / and the sacramēt of chri¦stys bloude ys Christys bloude so the sacramēt of fayth ys fayth. For yt ys no nother thynge to beleue then to haue fayth / and therfore when a man answereth that the infant beleueth which hath not the affecte of fayth / he answerethe that yt hathe faythe for the sacrament of fayth: And that yt turneth yt sellfe to GOD / for the sacra¦ment of conuersyon. For the answere yt sellfe perteyneth vnto the mynistryng of he sacra∣ment. As the apostle wryteth of baptyme: we are buryed (sayeth he) with Christe thorough baptyme vnto deth. He sayth not we signyfye buryinge / but vtterlye sayeth we are buryed. He called therfore the sacrament of so great a thynge euyn with the name of the verye thyn∣ge yt sellfe. &c. Iff a man wolde auoyde con∣tencyon and loke soberly on thosse wordes of Sayncte Austen / he shall sone perceyue the my¦sterye of thys matter. For euyn as the next good frydaye shalbe caulled the day of Christes passyon: and yet he shall not suffer deth agay∣ne vppō that daye / for he dyed but onece and ys nowe immortall? euyn so ys the sacrament cal∣led Chrystes bodye. And as that daye ys not the verye daye that he dyed on / but onlye a re∣membrance therof / So the sacrament ys not hys verye naturall bodye / but onlye a remem∣brance of hys bodye breakynge and bloude she dynge. And lykewyse / as the next ester daye shall be called the day of hys resurrectyon / not that yt ys the very same daye that Chryste dyd ryse in / but a remembraunce of the same.
Euyn so the sacrament ys called hys bodye: not that yt ys hys bodye in dede / but only a remem¦brāce of the same. And furdermore euyn as the prest doth offer hym / that ys to saye crucyfye hym at masse / euyn so ys the sacramēt his bodye But the masse doth but only rep̄sent his passyō And so doth the sacramēt represent hys bodye. And et though the masse dothe but rep̄sent his crucifying / we maye trulye saye he ys cruified / eun so though the sacramēt do but signifie or re¦p̄sent hys bodye / yet may we trulye saye that yt ys hys bodye. Why so? verely (sayeth he) for the sacramentes haue a certayne similitude of thos thinges wherof the are sacramentes. And for this simiitude for the moste {per}te / they take the namys of the vere thynges. Blessed be god wt hathe so clerely discussed this matt by this faith full father. Notwtstonding he doth yet expresse yt more playnlye saying: after a certayne maer the sacramēt of Christes bodye ys Christes bo¦dye. Be holde deare brethern he sayth after a cer¦tayne maner the sacrament ys Christes bodye. And by that you may sone knowe that he neuer ment that yt shulde be hys verye naturall bodie in dede / but onlye a token and memoriall to ke∣pe in mmorie the deth of his bodye / and so to no¦rishe o{ur} fayth. Besides that his similitude wc he after alegeth of baptime / doth holye expounde this matter / for (saieth he) the apostle saieth not we signifie buryinge: but he saieth / we are buri¦ed (ād yet in dede the baptyme doth but signifie yt). And there vppon s. Austen addeth / that he called the sacramēt of so great a thinge euyn wc
the name of the very thinge yt sellfe. And lyke wise yt ys in o{ur} sacramēt. Finallye to be shorte I wyll passe ouer many places wc I haue gather¦red oute of this holye father / and wyll touche but this one moare. Saincte Austen sayth.August cōtra ada¦mantum. Non nim D̄s dubitauit dicere, Hoc est corpus meū, cū daret signū corporis sui. Et in eodē capite exponit Sic est em̄ sanguis anima, quomodo petra erat chri¦stus, nec tamē petra (ait) significabat Christum, sed ait petra erat Christus. That is to say The lorde doubted not to saye / this ys my boye / when he gaue a signe of his bodye. And after in the same chapiter he expoundeth yt. For trulye so the bloude ys soule / as Christe was the stone. And yet the apostle sayth not / the stone did signifye Christ / but he sayth the stone was Christe. Here. s. Austen saith playnlye that Christe cal¦led the signe of his bodye / his bodye / ād in this chapiter doth cōpare these thre textes of scrip∣ture / this ys my bodye / the bloud ys the soule / and Christe was the stone: and declareth thē to be one phrase and to be expounded after one fas¦shyon. Now ys there no mā so mad / as to saye / that Christ was a naturall stone (except he be a naturall foole) whose Iudgmnt we nede not greatly to regard therfore we may well cōclude that the sacramēt ys nat his naturall bodie / but is caulled his bodie / for a similitude that yt hath wherin yt signifieth & representeth his bodye. And that the sacrament of so great a thinge ys caulled euyn wt the name of the verye thinge yt sellf / as s. Austen sayde immdiatly before. This were proffe ynough to cōclude that all
the olde fathers did holde the same opinion / for who wolde once surmise (seinge we haue. s. austē so payne for vs wc is the chesest emōge thē all) who wolde once surmise I say / that the dissented in this great matter from the other faithfull fa∣thers / or they frō him? neuerthelesse I dare not let hī stōde post alone / ieste ye dispice him. And therfore I will shewe you the minde of certaine othr allso: and fure of his master s. Ambrose. Ambrosi: super l mort annūcia.S. Ambrose wrytynge vppon the Epistle of Paule to the Corinthiās in the .xi chap. sayth Quia em̄ morte Dn̄i libeati sum{us}, hui{us} rei in eden do & potādo, carnē & sanguinē q {pro} nobis oblata sunt, significamus. That is to saye / because we be deliuered by the deth of the lorde / in eatyng and drynkinge of this thynge meanynge of the sa∣crament / we signifye the fleshe & bloude wc were offered for vs. Here doth s. ambrose saie ynough yf men were not sophisters / but wolde be cōtent wt reason. For he sayeth that in eatyng ād drin¦kyng the sacrament of Christes bodye we signi¦fie or represent the fleshe and bloude of our sa∣uyour Iesus. Natwtstondynge be cause you a∣re so slybberye / we shall bynde you a lytle  bet∣ter by this mans wordes. Ambrosi de sacra.S. Ambrose sayth Sed forte dices speciē sangui¦nis nō uideo, sd habet similitudinē. Sicut em̄ mor¦tis similitudinē sumpsisti, ita etiā similitudinē pre∣ciosi sanguinis bibis. That ys to saye. But {per}ad∣uenture thou wylte saye / I se no apperaūce of bloude / but yt hathe  similitude. For euyn as thou haste taken the similitude of deth / euen so thou drinkest the similitude of the p̄cyous blou¦de.
Here maye ye see by the cōferrynge of thesse two sacramentes / what. s. Ambrose iged of it For he sayeth euyn as thou haste taken a simili¦tue of hys deth in the sacramēt of baptyme so doste thou drinke a similitude of his preciouse bloude in the sacramēt of the auter. And yet as s. Austē sayd before / the apostle saith not we sig¦nifie buryinge / but sath / we are buried. And li¦kewise here Christ sayd not this signifyeth my bodye / but this ys my bodye / callng the sacra∣mēt / signe / tokē and memoriall of so great a thin¦ge / euyn wt the name of the verye thinge yt sell¦fe thus doth. s. Ambrose choke our sophisters. Neuerthelesse I will allege one place more ou∣te of s. ambrose / where he sayth.Ambrosi. libro. 3. de sacramen Dicit sacerdos fac nobis hāc oblationē scriptā rationabilē, qd est figu¦ra corporis Dn̄i nostri resu xpi. That ys / the prest saith make vs this oblaciō acceptable. &c. For yt is a figure of the bodie of o{ur} lorde Iesu christ Here he caulleth yt playnly a figure of christes bodie / wc thinge you can not auoyde. Therfore geue prayse vnto God ād ett his trouth sprede wc ys so playnlye testified / bi theis holye fathers How lett vs se what s. Hierom sayth. Saincte Hierom writynge vppon Ecclesiaste sayth on thys maner.Hieroni: su{per} eccle: Caro DOMINI uerus ci∣bus est, & sanguis eius uerus potus est, hoc solum habemus in praesenti saeculo bonum, si uescamur carne eius cruoreque potemur, non solum in miste¦rio, sed etiā in scripturarū lectione, verus em̄ cibus est & potus, q ex uerbo dei sumitur scientia scriptu¦rarū. That ys to saye: the fleshe of the lorde ys verye meate / and his bloude ys verye drynke.
This ys onlye the pleassure or profite that we haue ī this wordle that we maye eate his fleshe ād drinke his bloude not only in a misterry / but allso in the readinge of scriptures. or yt is ve¦ry meate and drinke  wc ys taken oute of God∣des worde by the knowelege of scriptures. He¦re maye ye se s. Hieroms mnde in fewe wordes For furste he sayth that we eate his fleshe and drinke his bloud in a misterye / wc ys the sacra∣mēt of his rmmbraunce and memoryall of his passion. And ater he addeth that we eate hys fleshe & drinke his bloude in the redinge ād kno¦welge of scriptures and calleth that very mea¦te & very drike. And yet I am sure ye are not so grosse / as to thinke that the letters wc you re¦ade are torned in to naturall fleshe & bloude. And likewise yt ys not necessarie that the bred should be torned in to his bodye / no more than the letters in scripture are tournd in to his fle¦she. And neuerthelesse thorough fayth we may as well ate his bodie in recyuinge of the sacra¦mēt as eate his fleshe in readinge of the letters o the scripture. Besides that s. Hierom caueth the vnderstondinge o the scripture verye ma∣te and very drinke: wc you muste nedes vnder∣stond in a misterie and spūall sense / for yt ys no¦ther materiall meate nor drīke that ys receiuyd wt the mouth and teth / but yt is spn̄all meate & drinke / and ys so called for a similitude and pro¦pertie: be cause that as meate & drinke comforte the bodye and outward man / so doth the readin¦ge and knowelege of sripture cōforte the soule and inward man. And likewise yt ys of christes
bodye / wc ys caulled verye meate and very drin¦ke / wc you muste nedes vnderstond in a mysterie or spūall sense (as. s. Hierom called yt) for his bo¦dye is no materiall meate nor drinke that ys re¦ceyued wt the mouth or teth: but yt is spirituall meate & drinke / and so called for a similitude & {pro}¦perti / because that as meate and drinke / cōfor∣te the bodye / so doth the fayth in his bodye brea¦kinge & bloudsheding refreshe the soule vnto li¦ff euerasting. We vse yt cūstomablye in o{ur} day¦lye speache to saye / when a chylde setteth all hys mynde and delyght on sport and playe: It ys meate ād drinke to this childe to plaie. And all¦so we saye by a man that loueth well hawkinge & huntyng: It ys meate and drinke to this mā to hawke & hunte. Where no man doubteth / but yt ys a figuratiue speache. And therfore I wō∣dr that they are so blinde in this one poynt / of Christes bodye. And can not allso take the wor¦des figuratiuelye / as thesse olde doctours did. Agayne s. Hierom sayth.Hieroni∣mus supe Matheū Post{quam} mystium pascha fuerat impletū & agni carnes cū apostolis comede¦ra, assumit panē qui cōfortat cor hominis, & ad ue¦rū paschae transgreditur sacramentū, quomodo in praefiguratione eius Melchisedech uinū & panē pro ferens fecerat, ipse quo{que} ueritatem corporis reprae¦sentaret. That ys to saye after the misticall ester lambe fullfylled and that Christe had eaten the lambes fleshe wt the apostles / he toke brede wc cō¦forteth the herte of mā / and passeth to the true sacramēt of the easter lambe: that as Melchise∣dech brought for the bred and wyne figuring hī / so might he likewise rep̄sent y• trueth of his bo∣die.
Here doth s. Hirom speake after the maner that tertulliā did before: that hrist wt brede and wine did represent the truth o his bodie, For x¦cept he had had a rue bodie / he could not laue a figure of yt nor rep̄sent yt vto vs. or a vay∣ne thinge or phātase can haue no figure / nor cā not be rep̄sented as by exāple how shoulde a mā make a figure of his drame or rep̄sent yt vno o{ur} memorie? Bu christ hath let vs a figure ād rep̄sentaciō of his bodie in bred and wine: ther¦fore yt folowyth tha he had a true bodye. And that this was s. Hieroms mde doth mafeast¦lye apere by the word  da / wc doth more copiousi sett out this sayinge of Hierm.Beda su∣per Luc. For he writeth on this maner. Fiitis paschae ueterisso lennijs q in cōmemorationē antiquae de aegypto li¦beratiōis agebant, trāsit ad nouū qd in suae redem¦ptionis memoriā ecclesia frequentare desidrat, ut uidelicet pro carne agni uel sanguine suo, carnis san¦guinis{que} sacramentū in panis ac uini figua substi∣tuens, isum se esse mosaet cui iurauit Dn̄s. Tu es sacerdos in aeterū seundū ordinē Melchisedech rangit autē ipse panem quē porrigit, ut osendat corporis sui fractionē non sine sua sponte futuram Similiter & calicem posiq  nauit dedit eis. Quia ergo panis carnem confirmat, uium uero sangui∣nem operatur in carne, hic ad corpus Christi mysti¦ce, illud refertur ad sanguinem. That ys to saye. After the solemnite of he olde aster ambe was fynished which was l srued in the rmembra¦unce of he olde delyueraunce oute of Egypt / he goth vnto the newe whiche the churche glad¦lye obseruith in the remembraūce of hys rdm¦ptyon
/ that he in the sede of the fliche ād blou¦de of the lambe / myght institute and ordeyne the sacrament of his fleshe & boude in the fygu¦re of brede and wyne / and so decare hym sellf to be the ame vnto whom the lorde sware thou ar¦te a perpetuall prest after the order of Melchi∣sedech. And he hym sellf brake the brede which he gaue  to shewe that the breakynge of hys bo¦dye shuld not be don with out hys owyn wyll. And lkewise he gaue them the cuppe after e hade soopd. And because brede doth confyr∣me or strengthe the fleshe / and wyne worketh bloude in the lshe / therfore ys the brde misti∣callye referred vnto the bodye of Christe / and the wyne referred vnto hys bloude. Here maye you note / furste that s the lam∣be was a remembraunce of ther delyueraunce oute of Egipt (and yet the lambe delyuered thē not) so ys the sacrament a remembraūce of o{ur} re¦dēptyon (and yet the sacramēt redemed vs not) esydes that he sayth / that Christ in the stede of the fleshe and bloude of the lambe / did institu¦te the sacrament of hys fleshe and bloude in fy∣gure of brede and wyne. arke well he sayth not that in the stede of lambes fleshe and blou∣de he dyd institute hys owyn fleshe and bloude but ayeth that he dyd institute the sacrament of hys fleshe and bloude. What thynge ys a sa¦crament? verelye yt ys the sygne of an holye thyng / and there ys no defferrence btwene a sygne and a sacrament / but that the sygne ys referred vnto a wordly thynge and a Sacra∣ment vnto a spirituall or holye thynge.
As s. Austen sayth.Ad Mar¦cellum. Signa cū ad res diuinas perti∣nent, sacramenta appellantur. That ys to saye / si¦gnes when they partayne vnto godly thinges are called sacramentes. Thefore when Beda saieth that thei did institute the sacramēt of his fleshe and bloude in the figure of bred and wine yt ys as moche to saye (by s. Austens diffinitiō) as that he did institute the figure of his holye fleshe and bloude in the figure of bred ad wine that ys to saye / that brade and wyne shuld be th figure and signe rep̄sentyng his holy fleshe & bloude vnto vs / for a perpetuall remembrāce And afterward he declareth the pro{per}tye or wt the brede ys called the bodye and the wyne the bloude: sauynge he speaketh ot so darkelye as I now doo / but playnlye sayth that the brede is misicallye refferred vnto the bodye of Christe: be cause that as brede doth strengthe the flshe so Christes bodye which ys figured by the brede doth srengthe the soule thorough sayth in his deth. And so doth he clerlye proue my purpose. Crisoso. su{per}. MatNow lett vs se what Chrisostome sayth wc shall describe vs the fayth of the olde greacyās and (I doubte not) he had not loste the treue fayth / how so euer the wordle goo now adayes. Chrisostome sayth in this maner. Si enim mor∣tuus esus nō est cuius signū & simbolum hoc sacr¦ficiū est? uides uantū ei studium fuerit ut semper memora teneamus pro nobis ipsum mortuū fuisse That ys to saye / for yf Iesus haue not died / whosse memoriall and signe ys the sacrifyce. Thow seyst what diligēce he gaue that we shul¦de contynuallye kepe in memorie that he dyed
for vs. Here you maye see that Chrisostome cal¦leth the sacramēt symbolu et signū: that is to saye / a mmoryll and signe of christ / ād that yt was intitute to kepe hys deth in perpetuall re¦mēbraūce. But of one thinge thou muste bewa¦re or els thou arte deceyued / h calleth it allso a sacrafice / and there thou muste wyselye vnder∣stond hym.sacrafice. For yf yt were the sacrafice of Chri¦stes bodye / then mste christes bodye be slayne ther agayne / wc thynge God forbyd. And ther∣fore thou muste vnderstond hym whē he calleth yt a sacrafice / that he meaneth yt to a remembra¦unce of that holye sacrafice where christes bo∣dye was offered on the crosse once for all. For he cā be sacrafied no more / seinge he ys immor¦tall. Not withstondyng our prelattes will here note me of presumption / that I dare be so bool¦de to epounde hys mynde on thys fasyon For in dede they take hym otherwise / & thynke that yt ys a vrye sacrafice. And therfore I wyll brynge one other text / where Chrisostome shall expoūd hī sellf. Chrisostome sayth:Crisosto. ad Hebre. home. 17. Nne {per} sin¦gulos dies offerrim{us}? offerrim{us} qde, sed ad recor¦dationē mortis ei{us} faciētes. Hoc aūt sacrificiū (sicut pōtifex) ed id ipsum sem{per} facimus: Imo recordati onē sacrificij. That ys to saye / do we not dayly offer or do sacrafice? yes suerlye / But we do yt for the remembraunce of his deth / for this sacra¦fic ys as an example of that we offer / not an other sacrafie as the bushop (in the olde lawe) did / but euer the ame: ye rather a remembra∣unce of the sacrafice. Furst he sayeth that they daylye do sacrafice / but yt ys in remembraunce
of Christes dth Ten he sayth that the sacri∣fice ys an example of that. Thyrye he sayth that they offer ot an other sacryfyce (that ys to saye an oxe or a goote) as the bushoppes of the olde lawe but euer the same Merke thys poynte for though yt seame at the fyrst syght to make with thm yet doth yt make so derect∣lye agaynst them  that they shall neuer be able to auoyd yt Crysostm sayth they do not of∣fer an other sacrifye a the bushoppes did but euer the sme. They ofer other brede & wyne thys dae then they yd yesterdaye: they shall saye an other mae to morowe then they dyd thys daye. Now yf thys brede and wyne / or the masse be a sacrifyce  then do they offer an o∣ther sacrifyce / as well as the bushoppys of the olde lawe. For thys sacrifyes dyd signifie that Christ shulde come and shd hs boude / s well as the bred / wine and masse do represent that he hath done yt in dede. And therfore yff yt be a sa¦crifyce / then do they offer an other sacrifyce / re¦presentyng hys passyon / as well as the Bs∣hop of the old lawe But that doth chrysostme denye / and sayth that hey offer euery day the same. What same? vere eun the same that was done and sacried when Christe she his bloude. In thys sacrifyce ys Christe euery da¦ye bounde and buffed and lede from nna to Cayphas: he ys brough to Pylae and condem¦pned: he ys scorged and crowned with thorne & nayled on te cross and hys herte opeynned wt aspere / and so shdeth his bloude. For our re¦dempcion. Why chrisostome, and do you the seel¦fe
same sacrifice euery daye? ye verelie.Roma.  Thē why doth S. Paulle saye that christe ys risyn from deth / and dieth no more? yf he dye no more / how do you daylie crucfye hym? For sothe Paulle sayeth trouthe. For we do yt not actuallye in de¦de / but nly in a misterie. And yet we saye / that we do sarifice hy and that thys ys his sacry¦fice / for the celbaiō of the sacramēt ād memo¦rye of the passyō which we kepe:As s. Au¦sten decla¦reth a fo∣re ad Bo¦nifacim & for this cau¦se yt hathe the name of the thyge that yt doth represent & signifie. And therfore I exponde my minde be a rethoricall corretin and saye / Imo recodationē sacrifi, that is to saye / yee ra∣ther the remēbraūe of the sacrifice. Grauntmer¦cys good Chrisostome: now do I perceyue the pyth of thys matter: euyn as the masse ys the ve¦ry deth and passyō of christe / so ys yt a sacryfi∣ce. Now yt doth but onlye represent the verey deth & passyō of christe / therfore yt doth folowe that the masse in very dede doth but only repre¦sent a sacrifice. And yet nat wt stāding many ty¦mes yt is called a sacrifice of holly doctos / ād hathe the name of the very same thynge that yt doth represent & signifie. And euyn s we maye saye oft  is sacramēt / that as the masse is the ve¦rye sacryice and passyō of christ / so ys the sacra¦mēt hys verye bodye and sacrifice that s offe∣red. Nowe the msse doth bt ōly rep̄sent & signi¦fie the passiō: so the sacramēt doth but ōlye rep̄¦sent & signifie th bodye & verye sacrifice onece offered for euer. Natwtstōdinge many times the masse is called a sacrifice of ho octos: & so the the sacrament ys called the bodye ād a sacrifice.
And hathe the name of the verye same thynge that yt doth represent and signifye. Chrisost. su{per} matt.Furthermore Chrisostome sayth. Ipse quo{que} bi¦bit ex eo, ne auditis uerbis illis dicerēt. Quid igitur sanguinē bibimus & carnem cōmedimus  ac ideo perturbarentur, nam & quando prius de his uerba fecit, etiam uerbis ipsius offendabantur. Ne igitur tūc id quo{que} accideret, primus ipse hoc fecit, utad cōmunionem misteriorum induceret intrepidam. That ys to saye: he allso dranke of yt / lest when they herde his wordes / they shulde saye: why do we than drinke bloude and eate fleshe? and so shuld be trobled. For when he spake before of thosse thinges / they were offended wt his wor∣des. And because that shulde not now also chaū¦ce / he hym sellfe drāke furst of yt / that he might cause them to come wt oute feare to the {per}takinge of those misteries / here Chrisostome noteth that Christe dranke of yt / to drawe thē from the gro¦sse vnderstondinge of his wordes / and by hys drinking to testifye vnto them that yt was not his naturall bloud nor his naturall fleshe in de¦de / but only memoriallys and rep̄sentacyones of his bodye and blode. And therfore he calleth thē misters: that ys to saye sacramētes. For in this place a sacramente ād a misterye ys all one thinge. Notwtstondinge some tyme thys worde misterye ys more comen & large in signifying then this worde sacramēt. And I haue shewed you before / that a sacrament ys the signe of an holye thinge / and not the thinge yt sellfe / that yt rep̄senteth: albeit somtyme yt beare the name of the verye thinge yt sellfe / as the Image of.
Peter ys not saynct Peter hym sellfe and yet yt beareth hys name. Chrisosome sayth. Caro nō prodest quicq: hoc est, secundū spiritū uerba mea audienda sunt. Qui secundū carnē audit, nihil lucratur, nihil utilitatis ac¦cipit. Quid est autē carnaliter intelligere? simplici∣ter ut res dicuntur, ne{que} aliud quippiam excogitare Misteria oīa interioribus oculis consideranda sunt, hoc est spiritualiter. That ys to saye. The fleshe profiteth nothing: that ys / my wordes muste be vnderstond after the spryte / he that vnderston∣deth them after the fleshe winnith nothing / nor taketh no profete what meaneth this / to vder¦stonde after the fleshe or carnallye? verelye to ta¦ke the thingys simple as they are spoken / and to thinke none other thynge. All misteryes or sacramentes muste be considered wt the inwarde eyes / that ys saye spirituallye. And after he expoundeth hym sellfe on thys maner, Interiores autē oculi ut panē uiderint, crea∣turas transuolant, & nō de illo pane a pistore cocto cogitāt: sed de eo qui dixit se panē uitae, qui per mi¦sticū panē significatur, That ys to saye. The in∣warde eyes as sone as they see the bred / thei pas¦se ouer the creatures / ād thinke not of that bred wc ys bakyn of the bakear / but of hym that cal∣led hym sellfe the brede of lyffe wc ys sigifyed by the misticall or sacramētall brede. Wolde you haue hym sae any more? he telleth you playne / that Christe wc ys the verye bred of lyffe / ys sig¦nifyed by this sacramentall brede. And that ys the thīge wc o{ur} bushoppes so fleshlie deneie now adayes / wc thinge yet you maye set / the olde fa∣thers
conclude wc one asnt. Notwtstonding yet I will allege mo olde dotours / so that from hen¦ce forward they mye be asamd to calle yt ne¦we errnng. Fulgentius saith.Fulgen∣tius .. li brode fide In illis em̄ carnalibus ({per}e legis) uictimis, signifi∣catio fit carnis Christi quā proptis nostris & ipse sie pt̄ fuerat oblaturus, & sanguinis quē erat ef¦fsur{us} in reissionē peccatorū nostrorū. In isto aū sacrificio gratirū actio at{que} cōmemoratio est carnis Christi quā {pro} nobis obtuli, & sanguinis quē {pro} nobis idē Dus effdit. Tat is to sae. In thes carnall sacrificis in the tyme of the law / was a sinificaiō of te fleshe of christe wc h wt oute syne / shulde offer for our synnes / ad of the blod wc he suld shede out in rmson of our synne. But in this sacrifice is a thāes guīg & remēbraunce of the fleshe of christe wc h ofe∣red for vs / & of te bloude wc the sa god shed oute for vs Frste note that he calleth y a sacri¦fice wc notwtstonding is but a remēbraunce of tht sacrifice ofere o the crose once for all / a yt ys proued before oute of Chrisostome. Then he layly calleth t a thankes guinge / and remmbrance of Chrites flese and bloude: & so cōcludeth with vs. Neerthelesse because sophysters wolde son thynke to auoyde this plae / I wll allege one other sainge of the sa∣me / aucto wc they shall neuer be able to auoyde. ¶ Fulgentius sayeth / as Hyo estifieth-Hic calix nouum testamentum est:gen. id est, hic calix quem obis trado, nouum testamentum signifiat. That ys to saye. Thys cuppe or chalice ys the new testament: That ys / thys cuppe or chali¦ce
which I deliuer you doth sygnifye the newe testamēt. In thys place he doth playnlye shewe his mynde / wc can ot be auoyded. For euyn as the cuppe ys the newe testamēt  so ys the bre¦de the bodye. owe the cuppe dothe but sygni¦fye the new testament. And therfore I may cōclu¦de that the brede doth but sygifye the bodye. Eusbus sayeth.Eusebi Quia corpus assumptum abla¦turus erat ex oculis nostris & syderibus allaturus, ncssarium erat ut nobis in hac die acramentum corporis & sanguinis consecraret, ut coleretur iugi¦ter per mysterium quod semel offerebatur in pre∣cium. That ys to saye: Because he wolde take awaye out of oure eyes the bodye that he toke and carye yt in to heuyn / It was necessarie that in thys tyme he sulde cōsecrate to vs the sacra¦ment of his bodie and bloude: that that wc was once offered for the price of o{ur} redēptyō / might cōtnuallye be honored thorough the mysterye. To cōsecrate a thinge / is to apply yt vnto an holy vs.Cōsecr Here you maye see that he callth yt the saramēt of his bodie and boude / wc bodie is caryd vp in the heuen: And allso he calleth yt a mistrye wc is ynowe for them that will see. Allso druthmarius expoundeth thes wordes this is my bodye on thys maner:Druth∣marius. Hoc est corpus meum in misterio. That is to saye: this remy bo¦dye i a mystrie. I thynke you knowe what a misterye meaneth hriste is crucifid euery daye in a misterie: that is to saye / euery daye his deth ys represented by the sacramentes of remē¦braunce. The masse is Christes passyon is a mi¦sterye: that ys to saye: the masse doth rep̄sented
hys passion ād kepeth yt in oure memorie. The brede ys Christes bodye in a misterie: that is to saye / t rep̄senteth hs bodye that was brokyn for vs  and kepth yt in oure remembraunce. Yow haue herde all redye the mynde of the do¦ctours / how the sacrament ys Christes bodye. And now I shall shewe you how the sacrament ys oure bodye / wc doth not a lytell help to the vndstōding of theis wordes wc are in cōtrouersie The sacramēt of the aulter ys oure bodye as well as yt ys christes bodye. And euyn as yt is oure bodye / so ys yt Christes. But there ys no man that can saye that yt is oure naturall bodie in dede / but onlye a figure / signe / memoriall or rep̄sentacyon of o{ur} bodie Wherfore yt must allso folow  that yt ys but onlye a figure / signe / me∣moriall or rep̄sentacyon of Christes bodie. The furste {per}te of this argumēt mae thus be proued S. Austen wryting in a sermone saeth on this manerAugusti¦us ī ser∣one ad antes. Corpus ergo Christi si uu tis intelligere, apo¦stolū audite dicentē, Vos estis corpus Christi & mē¦bra. 1. Cor. 12. Si ergo estis corpus Christi & mem∣bra, mysteriū uestrum{que} in mensa Dn̄i positū est, mysteriū Dn̄i positū est, misteriū Dn̄i accipitis, ad id quod estis, Amen respondetis & respōdendo sub¦scribitis. That is to saye: Yff you will vnderstō the bodye of Christe / here the apostle wc sayeth / ye are the bodye of Christe and membres. . cor. 12. thrfore yf ye be the bodye of christe ād mem¦bres / our misterie ys put vppon the lordes ta¦ble / ye receiue the misterie of the lorde / vnto that you are you answer Amen. And in answringe subscribe vnto yt. Here you maye see that the sa¦crament
ys allso o{ur} bodye / and yet ys not o{ur} na¦tral bodye / but onlye our bodye in a misterye / that ys to saye / a figure signe / memoriall or rep̄¦sentation of our bodye / for as the brede ye made of many graynes or cornes / so we (though we be many) are one brede ād one bodye. And for this {pro}pertie and smilitude yt ys called oure bodye and beareth the name of the verye thynge wc yt doth represent and signifye. Agayne s. Austen saythAugusti in sermo de sacrate riapasch Quia Christus passusest pro nobis, cōmendauit nobis in isto sacramento cor¦pus & sanguinē suū, quod etiam fecit & nos ipsos, Nam  nos ipsius corpus facti sumus, & per mise¦ricordiā ipsius quod accipimus nos sumus. Et po∣stea dicit. Iam in noīe Christi tan{quam} ad calicē Dn̄i ue¦nistis, ibi uos estis in mensa & ibi uos estis in calice That ys / because christ hath suffered or vs / he hath betaken vne vs in this sacramēt his bodie and bloude wc he hath allso made euyn our sell∣fes. For we allso are made hie bodye / and by his merye we are euyn the same thinge that we re¦ceyue. And after he sayth / now in the name of christe / ye are come / as a man wold saye / to the chalice of the lorde: there are ye vppon the table and there are ye in the chalice. Here you maye see / that the sacrament is oure bodye. And yet yt ys not oure naturall bodye / but onlye in a mi¦sterye as yt ys before sayd. Furthermore s. Austen sayethAngusti de sacra riapasch Hunc ita{que} cibū & potū societatē uult intelligi corporis & membro¦rum suorū qd est sancta ecclesia in predestinatis & uocatis & iustificatis & glorificatis sanctis & fideli¦bus ius. Huius rei sacramentū alicubi quotidie, ali∣cubi
certis interuallis dierum in dominico prepara¦tur & de mena Domini sumitur, quibusdam ad ui¦tam, quibusdam ad exitium. Res uero ipsa cuius est sacramenum, est omni homini ad uitam, ulli ad extium, quiun{que} eius particeps surit. That is to saye / he wyll that his meate ād drike sulde be vnderstond to be the felowship of his bodye & membris which is the holye churches in the pre¦destinate and called and iustifyed and glorifyed hys saynctes and faythfull, The sacramet of this tinge ys prepared in some place daylye / ad in some place at certayne appoynted dayes as on the sondaie And yt is receiued rm t ta¦ble of the lorde / to some vnto ffe and to some vnto distrucion. Bu he thing yt sfe whose sacramnt this is  ys reyed of all me vno iff / and of no man vto  who so euer is partaker of yt. Here doth  uen furse saye / that thys sacrament ys the owshyp of hys bodye and memres which are we. And yet yt ys not oure naturall bodye / as ys before sayd. And then he sayth that te sacrament of thys thing ys rceyued of some vnto lyff and saluacyon and of sme vnto dt and dampna∣tion. For both aythull and faythfull ma¦ye receyue the sacraent. And after he sayeth / that the hyng yt sellff whose sacrament yt ys / ys receyued of al men vnto lyffe  and of no man vnto destructyon / who so ur ys partaker of yt. And of thys saynge yt muste nedes fol∣low / that onlye the aythfull eate CHRI∣STES bodye / and the vnaythfull eate him not For he ys receyued of no man vnto destru∣ctyon
And of this yt muste allso followe that the sacrament ys not Christes bodye in dede / but onlye in a mysterye. For yff the sacrament were hys naurall bodye / then shulde yt foo∣we / that the vnfaythfull shlde receyue hys bo∣dye. Whych ys contrarye to the mynde of sainct Ausen / ad agaynst all truth? Thus haue we suffecyentlye proued the yrst part of oure argu¦ment / that the sacrament ys oure bodye / as well as yt ys CHRISTES. And nowe wyll I proue the second parte more playnly (although yt be ynough declared all redye / to them that ha¦ue eares) that ys / that euyn as yt ys oure bodie so ys yt Christes. Furste you shall vndersond that in the wine which ys called Christes bloude / is admixed wa¦ter / which doth signifye he people that are re∣demed wt his bloude: so tat te heed wc is Chri¦se / ys not wt oute hys bodye wc ys the faythfull people nor the bodye wt oute hys heed. Now yf the wyne when yt is cōsecrated / be torned bode¦lye in to Christes bloude / then is yt also necessa¦rie that th water wc is admixed be bodelie tor∣ned in to the bloude of the fayhfull people. For where as is one cōsecratiō muste followe one ope¦raion And where as is like reason there muse followe like misterie. But what so euer is signi¦fied bi the water as cōcerninge the fayhfull peo¦ple / is takē spūall Therfore what so uer is spo¦kē of the bloud ī the wine / muste also neds beta¦kin spūallie.Bartrā. This reason is not mine / but yt is made bi one bartrā vppō a .700. yeres sins / whē this matt was furse ī disputacō. Where vppon
at the instance of great Chares the Emperour he made a boke {pro}fessynge euyn the same thinge that I doo / and {pro}ueth by the olde doctours and faythfull fathers / that the sacramēt is Christes bodye in a misterie / that ys o saye / a signe / figu¦re or memoriall of his bodye whiche was brokē for vs / and not his naturall bodye. And therfo¦re that doctrine ys newe wc otherwise teacheth / and not myne wc ys not myne / but the doctrine of Christe and of the olde fathers of Christes churche / tyll Antichriste began to sytt and reig¦ne in the temple of God, pria∣nus ade¦ciu,Besydes that Cypriane sayth that the people ys annexed in the sacramēt thorough the mitu¦re of water. Therfor I meruell me moche that they are so cōtentious and will not see / that as the water ys the people / so the wyne ys christes bloude / that ys to saye in a misterye / because yt representeth christes bloude / as the water doth the people. eusebiusFurthermore Eusebius sayth Dū in sacramē¦tis uino aqua miscetur, christo fidelis populus incor¦poratur & iungitur & quadā ei copula perfecta cha¦ritatis unitur. That ys to saye / whyes in the sa∣crament water ys admixte wt the wyne / the faith¦full people ys incorporate & Ioyned wt Christe ād ys made one wt hym / wt a certyne knott of {per}¦fayte charite. Now where he sayeth / that we are Ioyned and in corporate wt Christe / what fon∣denes were yt to cōtende / syth we are there on∣lye in a misterye / and not naturallye: to contend I saye wt suche pertinacite that his naturall bo¦dye muste be there: and not rather that he ys
Ioyned with vs / as we are Ioyned with hym and both in a misterie / bi the knott of parfaye charyte. The yonge man perceyuith well ynough thatMore. an allegorie vsed in some place is not a cause suf¦ficient to leue the proper significations of godes worde in euery other place and seke an allego∣rye / and forsake the playne comen sense, For he confesseth that he wolde not so do saue for neces¦site: because (as he sayeth) that the cōmen lyte∣rall sense is impossible. For the thinge he sayth that is mēte therbye can not be true? That is to wite / that the verye bodie of christe can be in the sacrament / because the sacramēt ys in many di¦uerse places at onece / and was at the maundye: that ys to wite / in the handes of Christe ād eue¦rye of his appostellis mouthes. And at that ty∣me yt was not glorified. And then he saieth that Christes bodye not beinge glorified / coulde no more be in to places at once than his awne can. And yet he goth after furder / and sayeth no mo¦re yt can whan yt is glorified to. And that he {pro}¦ueth by the sayinge of S. Austen whose wordes be / that the bodye with which Christ arose mu∣ste be in one place. &c. Hertherto hath maister More resoned reaso∣nablie:Frith. but now he beginnith to decline from the dignite of diuinite in to the dirtye dregges of vayne sophistrie. For where I saye that I mu¦ste of necessite seke an allegorie because the lite∣rall sense is impossible and can not be true / mea¦ning that yt can not stōde wt the processe of scri¦pture / but that other textes do of necessie con∣straine
me to construe yt spirituallye. There ca¦chet he this worde / can / and this worde impos∣sible / and wolde make men beleue that I ment / yt could not be true because reason can not rea∣che yt / but thinketh yt impossibe. And there he triumpheth (beore the victorie) & wold know what article of o{ur} faith I could assgne / in wc rea¦son shall not dreue awaie the strēgthe of mi pruf¦fe  ad make me leue the literall sense wherin my proffe shuld sōd / & sende me to seke an allegorie that might stond wt reason / and driue away the faith. But now deare brethern / siht I speake not of the impossibilite of reason / but of the im∣possibilite to stōde wt other textes of scripture / ye maye see that this ryall reason is not worth a rishe. Then wolde he faine knowe the place we¦re s. Ausē so saieth, wc thīge allthought / t were harde for m to tell / sith I haue not his bokes to loke for yt  yet I thāk god my memorie is not so bad / but I can shewe him whre he shall fide yt. And because I thinke that he is more accu∣stomed to the popes lawes then o S. Ausens workes  sith he is become the p̄lates proctoure and patrone: I saye he shall not fayle but finde yt in hys lawes de cōsecratione. And where as he wolde wreste the wordes of s. Austen / which saith that the bodie in wc Christe arose muste ne¦des be in one place: sayinge that he might mea∣ne / not that his bodie might not le ī iuerse pla¦ces at onces / but that yt muste be in one place / that is to saie / in some one place or other / he spe¦aketh (sayth master more) nothinge of the sacra¦mēt nor saieth not his bodie wt wc he rosse muste
nedes be in one place / that yt can by no possibi∣lite be in any mo. This seameth to some a good lie glose / ād yet yt shall {pro}ue but a vayne euasiō For yf a man wold saye that the kinges graces bodye muste be in one place / and then a nother wolde expoūde that natwtstōdynge his wordes hys graces bodye myght be in two places at on¦ce / I thinke mn myght sone Iudge that he de¦licted to delaye / and myght saye / what nede he to determye / that he muste be ī one plae / except he thought in dede / that he myght be in no mo but onlye on? And though men myght so ar∣gue on other mens wordes / yet of sainct Austēs wordes this muste nedes follow / for he bryn∣gyth them in (as god wold) by a contrarie anti∣thesis sayinge,Ad Hie∣ronimū. Corpus in quo rsurrexit in uno lo∣co esse oportet, ueritas autem eius ubi{que} diffusa est. That ys to saye / hys bodye wherin he rose / mu¦ste be in one place / but hys truth ys dispered in all places. Where he playnlye concludeth by the contrarye antithesis that as hys truth ys disprsed in all places / so muste hys bodye ne∣des be in one place onlye. As by example / yf a man shulde saye. The kynge hys graces bodye muste ndes be in one place / but hys power ys thorough out hys Realme. Where no man doub¦teth / but that in saying one place / he meaneth one place onlye. And therfore though in some place / that worde muste / doth not signifie suche a necessite as excludeth all possibilite / yet ī this place yt doth so signifie / as the contrarye anti∣thesis doth euidently expresse. And where ye saye / that h speaketh nothig
of the sacramēt / I wolde ye shulde sticke still to that saynge. For this ys plaine / that he spea¦kyth of hys naturall bodye. And therfore yf he speake not of the sacrament / then haue you con¦cluded that the sacrament ys not hys naturall bodye: the contrarie wherof you wold haue mē beleue. Thus haue I shewed euidence / bothe where he shall finde the wordes of s. Austen and all so that I haue ryght allegeth them. ¶ Nat wtstondyng syth he maketh so moche of ys payntd sheth / I shall a le hym more auetorite that christes naturall bodye ys in one place olye. wc thynge proued doth vtterly con¦clude that the sacrament ys not his naturall bo¦dye / but onlye a memoryall representynge the same. And urste let vs ee s. Austens mynde. August. ad Dar∣danium.Saynte Austē wryting vnto dardanus deth playnlye proue that the naturall bodye of Chri¦ste muste nedes be in one place onlie / & allso that his soule can̄ be but in one place at once. The oc¦casion of hys pistle ys this: dardas did wryte vnto s. Austen for the exposition of thosse wor¦des that christe spake vnto the theiffe saynge: this daye shalt thou be with me in paradise: ād wit not how he shulde vnderstond yt / whether christe mēt that the theffe shulde be in paradise wt christs soule / or wt hys bodye  or wt hys god¦hed Ther vppon s. Austē wryteth that as touc¦hinge christes bodye / that daye yt was in the se¦pulchre. And sayeth that yt was not paradise / although it were in a gardē that he was buried For christe he sayeth ment of a place of Ioye. And that was not (sayth s. Austē) in hys sepul¦chre.
And as For christes soule / yt was that d¦ye in hell. And no man will saye  that paradise was there. Wherfore (sayth s. Austen) the text muste nedes be vnderstond / that christ spake yt of hys godhed. Now marke this argumēt of. s. Austen / and ye shall se my purpose playnlie pro¦ued. For seinge he expoundeth thys text vppon christes godhed / because hys māhod astouchin¦ge the bodye / was in the graue / & as touchyng hys soule / was in hell: you maye sone {per}ceyue / that Aust thought / that whiles his bodie was in the graue / yt was not in {per}adise to: ād becau∣se his soule was in hell / yt coulde not be in pa∣radise also. And therfore he verefyeth the texte vppō his diuinite. For yf he had thought that christes bodie or soule might haue byn ī diuerse places at once / he wolde no haue said / that the text muste nedes be vnderstōd of his diuite / but yt might full well / ye and moche better haue bin vnderstond of his manhode. Marke well thys place wc doth determine the doubte of this mat∣ter. Notwtstondinge the faythfull father leueth not the matter on this fayon / but allso taketh a waye soche fonde ymaginationis as wolde cau¦se men to surmise / that Christes bodie shulde be in mo places at once then one. For he sayeth. Cauendum est ne ita diuinitatem astruamus homi¦nis ut ueritatē auferamus corporis. Non est aūt con¦sequens ut quod in deo est, ita sit ubi{que}. Nam & de nobis ueracissime scriptura dicit, quod in illo uiui∣mus, mouemur & sumus. Nec tamē sicut ille, ubi{que} umus, sed aliter homo ille in Deo, qm̄ & aliter de{us} in illo hoe, proprio quodā & singulari modo. Vna
enim persona deus & homo est, et Vtrū{que} est unus Christus resus, vbi{que} {per} id quod deus est, in celo aūt {per} id quod homo. That ys to saye we muste be∣ware that we do not so afyrme the diuinyte of the mā / that we take awaye the truth of his bo¦die. For yt followyth not that the thynge wc is in god / shuld be ī euery place as god ys. For the scripture doth trulye estefie on vs / that we ly¦ue / moue & be in hym. And yet are we not in eue¦rie place as he is. How bey / hat mā is other wi¦se in god / & god otherwise in that mā by a certen peculier & syngler waye. For god ād mā is one person / ād bothe of thē one christe Iesu wc ys in euery place in that he is god, ād in heuyn / in that he is mā. Here Austē doth saye / that yf we shuld grāt christe to be in all places as touch∣yng his māhode / we shuld take awaye the truth of his bodye. For though his māhode be in god and god in hys manhode yet yt followeth not / that yt sulde be in euerie place / as god is. And aer he cōcludeth that as touching his godhed he ys in euery place / ād as thouchyng his man¦hode he is in hevin. What nede he to make thes wordes & antthesies / but because he thought verelye that though hys godhed were in euery place / yet hys māhode was in heuyn onlye. But yet thys holye doctoure goth furder (so that they maye e ashamed of ther pertye) and saeth.Augusti∣nus bidē Secundū hominē nam{que} in terra erat, non in coelo (vbi nūc est) quādo dicebat. nemo ascendet in coelū nisi qui descēdit de coelo, fiilius hoīes q est in coelo. That is to saye / as touchyng hys man∣hod he was in the yerth & not in heuyn (where
he now ys) when he sayd / no mā ascendeth into heuyn but he that descended from heuyn / the so∣ne of man wc is in heuin. Now I truste ye will be cōtent and lett the truth spred. For I am sure yt ys not possible for you to auoyde yt for he sa¦yeth / that as touching his māhod he was in the erth ād not in heuin / when he spake those wor∣des: & so proueth that he was not in  places at once then onlie one place. For els yf s. Austen had thought that he coulde haue byn in mo pla¦ces at onece thē one wt his bodye / then myght he not haue sayd / that he was in yerth and not in heuyn. For then a man might sone haue deluded hym & haue said Austen you can not tell / for he maie be in euery place. But they that so thinke ater Austēs mynde / do take awaye the truthe of his naturall bodye / and make yt a very phan¦tasticall bodye: frō the wc heresie god deliuer his faythfull. Besides this S. Austen doth saye. Christum Dominū nostrum unigenitū DEI filium equalē patri, eundem{que} hoīs filium quo maior est pater, & ubi{que} totum presentem esse non dubite tan{quam} Deum, & in eodem templo DEI esse uerum DEVM, & in aliena parte coeli propter corporis modū. That is to saye / doubt not but that chri¦ste o{ur} lorde the onlie begottō soune of god equall to the father / and the same beinge the sonne of man wherein the father ys greater / is hole p̄sent in all places as touchyng hys godhed and dwe∣llythe in the same temple of GOD as GOD and in some place of heuē for the cōdicion of his very bodie. Here is yt euidēt bi s. austēs words that as touchyng his godhed he is ī all places.
And as touching his manhod he is onlye in he∣uinye and not that onlye / but that he being in heuin as touching the measure  nature / condicy¦on and qualite of his naturall bodie / is only in one certayne place in heuin / and not in many places at once. Thus moche is proued oute of Saincte Austen. This truth is not onlye proued by s. Austēs auctorite / but allso by the noble clarke Fulgen∣tius wc wryteth on this maner Vnus idem{que} ho¦mo localis ex homine, qui esi Deus immensus expa¦e, unus idem{que} secundū humanam substantiā ab∣sens coelo cū esset in terra, & derelinquens terrā cū ascendisset in coelū. Secudm diuinā uero immen sam{que} substantā, nec colū dimittens cū de coelo des¦cendit, nec trrā desens, um ad colum ascendit. Quod ipsius Dn̄i certissimo smone potest cogno sci qui ut loalem osenderet suā humanitatē, dicit discipulis suis: Ascendo ad patrem meū & patrem uestrū, Deum meū & Deū uesrū, e Lazaro qu{que} cū dixisset, Lazarus mortuus est, adiunit dicens, e gaudeo propter uos (ut credatis) quoniā non erā ibi mmensitaem uero su diuinitat oftendens disci¦pulis dicit: Ec go uoisū sm us{que} ad cōsumma¦tionem saecu. Quomodo autē asendit in coelū nisi quia localis & uerus est homo, aut quomodo adest fidelibus suis, nisi quia idem inmensus & uerus D¦us est. That is to saye. The same one man is lo∣cale (that is to say / conteined in one place) as thouching his manhod / wc is also God vnmesu¦rable from the father: the same one man as tou∣ching the substance of his manhod / was absen from heuin / when he was in erth / and forsakin∣ge
the yerth / when he ascendid in to heuin / but as touching his godlie and vnmeasurable substā¦ce he nether for soke heuin when he descended frō heuen / nor forsoke the erth / when he ascēded vn¦to heuen. Which maye be knowen by the moste sure worde of the lorde wc to schew his humani¦te to be localle (that is to saye / contayned in one place onlye) did saye vnto his disciplis. I ascen¦de vnto my father and your father / my God & your God / of Lazarus also when he sayd / Laza¦rus is ded / he sayd futher, I am glade for yo{ur} sa¦ke (that you may beleue) for that I was not the¦re. And againe / schewing the vnmeasurablenes of his godhed / he sayd vnto his disciples / behol¦de I am wt you vnto the worldes ende / how did he ascend in to heuen / but because he is locall & a verye man? Or howe is he present vnto hys faythfull / but because he is vnmeasurable & ve¦rye God? Here maye you conclude by the aucto∣rite of this doctoure also / that Christes bodie is onlye in one place to onece. For he sayeth that christ as touchinge his māhed is locall: that is to saye / conteyned in one place onlye. And that he proueth by the scripture euen of Christes a∣wyn wordes. Now yf this be true (as mi cōscien¦ce doth testifie / how so euer other men shall Iud¦ge) Then muste yt nedes followe that his natu¦rall bodye can not be in the sacramēt. And the auctorite. I am sure no man can auoide / yt ys so playne. Now as for his naturall reasons be not wor∣thie the reasoning.More. For furste that the bodie of christ vnglorified coulde no more be in two pla¦ces
at once then his owyn can / because he is a na¦turall bodye / as he is. I will not examine no cō¦parison betweyn there to bodyes: but yf christe wolde tell me that he wolde eche of both there bo¦dyes to be in yftne places at once / I wolde be¦leue hym / and wolde neuer aske hym whether he wolde fyrst gloryfye them or not. But I am sure gloryfyed or vnglorified / yf he sayd yt / he ys able to do yt For the matter ys not ym∣possible to God. Frh.Truthe yt is that yf christe so sayde and in so saing so ment / thre is no doubte / but he were able so to doo. but that he in dede so grosslie mēt ye shall neuer proue. And in dede yf he had so ment that his owyn bodye naturall shuld haue cōtinued in the sacramēt wt is the meate of the soe thorough ayth / and not of the bodye by atinge yt / and maye as will be eatyn thorough ayth although yt Remayne in heuyn / as yf yt were here present to oure mouthes: yf I saie he had so ment / then wolde he neuer haue geuen vs suche scriptures as he did. For I saye that this grosse imaginacyon may not stonde wt the processe of the scripture wc ys receyued as yt shall appere by certayne txtes. Furste where o{ur} sauioure sayth: the fleshe pro¦fiteth nothīg. The waight of those wordes doth cōpell vs to vnderstōd oure matter spūalye / for by this short sentense we are no lesse plucked ba¦ke frō the carnall eatinge  then was Nichodem{us} that he shuld not once dreame of the carnall re∣generacyon / when christe sayd vnto hym: that what so euer was of the fleshe was fleshe. For
this ys a playne conclusion / that when Christe sayd / the fleshe profytyth nothynge / he ment yt euyn of hys owyn fleshe that yt coulde not pro¦fyte (as they vnderstod hym) to be eaten with the eth. Albeyt yt doth moche profyte to be slayne for o{ur} redēption & eaten thorough fayth. Which thīge we may doo although his naturall fleshe be not ī the sacramēt. or I may as well beleue in him though he be in heuen / as yf he we¦re in yerth and in the sacrament / ād bfor myn eyes. And that Christe spake these wordes of hys owyne bodye / yt ys playne by S. Ausens wordes wrytinge vppon the same place.Augusti. tract su{per} 6. Ioan. And therfore he sayeth / that they muste be vnderstōd spūallye / and addeth: yf thou vnderstond them spirituallye / they are sprite and lyffe. And though thou vnderstond thm carnallye / yet ne¦uerthelesse they are spryt and lyff: But vno the they are not sprite and lyff / which vnder∣stondest not spirituallye those thynges that I haue spoken. Allso Athanasius sayth.Athana∣sius . li. qu dix. verb Spūs est q uiuificat, ca∣ronō dest quicq: uerba q ego locutus sum, spūs sunt & uita. Nam & hoc loco utrū{que} de seipso dicit carnē & spiritū, & spiritū ab eo quod est secundū carnē distinxit, ut nō solū uisibile, sed etiā inuisibile quod in ipso erat credētes disār, qd et ea q dicit nō sunt carnalia sed spūalia. Quod em̄ comedentibus suffecisset corpus, ut totius mūdi alimonia fiat? Sed ea {pro}pter meminit ascēsus filij hoīs in coelū ut illos a corporali cogitatione auelleret, & post hac discāt carnē dictā cibum coelestem superne uenientem & spiritualem alimoniā quā ipse det, nā quae locutus
um (inquit) uobis spiritus sunt & uita. That is to saye / yt is the sprite that quikenth / the fleshe profieteth nothinge the wordes wc I speake vn¦to you / are spirite and liffe. For in this place al¦so he meaneth both of his owne fleshe and his o¦wyn spirite / and he deuided the spirite from the fleshe: that they might knowe thorough fayth not onlye the visible parte / but also the inuisible parte y• was in hym / and also that the wordes wc he spake were not carnall but spūall. For what bodye shuld haue suffsed to haue byn the meate of all the wordle? And euyn therfore did he ma∣ke mntion of the asesion of the sonne of man in to heuen / that he might wtdrawe them from the bodelye imaginaion / that they might here after lerne / that the fleshe was called heuynlye meate whych comth from a boue & spirituall meate wc he wolde gue. For (saythe Christe) the wordes that I haue spoken vnto you / are spi¦rit and liffe. Here you maye see that christe spa¦ke yt of his own fleshe / and ment playnlie that yt did nothinge profie / as infideles did vnder∣stond him. For els yt geuithe lyffe / as yt is re∣ceyued of the faithfull in a misterie. For as bar¦tramBartrā. sayeth / in this misterie of the bodie & blou¦de / is a spirituall operation wc geueth lyffe. With oute the wt operation those misteries do no¦thinge profite / for surelye (sayth he) they may fe¦de the bodye / but the soule they can not fede. Besides that the scripture sayth / that that en¦treth in by the mouth doth not defle a man / for as christe sayeth / yt is caste forthe in to the drawght. And by the same reason yt foloweth
that yt doth not sanctifie or make a man holye. But the sacramēt entreth ī by the mouth: therfo¦re yt doth folowe that (of yt sellfe) y doth not sā¦ctifie or make holie / & of this text shuld followe two incōueniēces / yf the sacramēt were the na∣tural bodie of christe Furste yt shuld folow that the bodie of christ shuld not sanctifie the faithful because yt entreth in by the mouthe. And agay¦ne yt shuld followe / that the bodie of christe shul¦de be caste oute in to the drawght / wc thinge is abominable, Wherfore yt muste nedes followe / that the sacramēt can not be his naturall bodie. Furthermore Christ wold not suffer that de∣uoute woman wc of loue sought hym at his se∣pulture / to touche his naturall bodye / because she lacked a poynt of fayth / and did not count him to be equall wt his father. And moche more yt shall followe that the wicked wc haue no faith nor loue towardes hm / shall not be suffered to eate his fleshe wt ther teth / & swallow yt in o their vnclene bodies: for that were moche more then to touche hym. And yet not withstādinge they receyue and eate the sacrament. Where vp∣pon yt shuld followe yf the sacrament were his naturall bodie / that they shulde in dede eate his bodie wc thinge may be recounted a blasphemye agaynst God. More ouer Christe sayth he that eateth my fleshe & drinketh my bloude dwelleth in me & I in him: Nowe we knowe right well that the wicked do eate the sacrament / and yet nether dwell in christe / nor christ in then. Wher¦fore yt muste followe that the sacrament is not the very fleshe of Christe. And surelye I can
not excuse thm of blasphemie whiche so directlye contrarye Chries wordes. Howe can you auoide these textes wc christ spe¦aketh vnto his disciples sayinge: yt a litell wh¦le am I wt you.Ioan. 6. And then I dparte to him that sent me. And agayne yt ys expedyent for you that I dearte.Ioan 6. For except that I departe / that comorter shall ot come vnto you.Ioan. 6. And agay∣ne he sayth / I forsake the worlde and goo to mi father.Math. 26 . 14. And to be shrt he sayth pore men ye shall euer haue wt you ut me shall you not euer haueIoan 12 ow we knowe right well that hys god∣hed ys in all placs / and ta as ouchynge his godhed he forsoke not the worde / when he as∣cended vnto hys faer. Wherfore yt muste ne∣des followe that he foroke yt as ouchyng hys fleshe and manhode And thero agreeth the ex∣positions of Sainct Austen  ad Fulgentius be¦fore alleged / yee and all oher olde faythfull fa∣thers. Now yf he hae forsake the worlde as touchynge the presnce of hys naturall fleshe and māhode (as all doctours defyne) then ment he not that hys naturall fleshe shulde be pre∣sent in the sacrament  to be aten with oure teth And therfore though Christe so tell you / yet muse you take hym as he meaneh / or ls you be begyled, For yf ye thynke that GOD both maye and wyll fullfll and veryfe all thyn∣ges accordynge to the letter as he spaketh thē / I maye call you an bedyent man / as Saynct BARNARD doth hys monke Adam And maye saye (as he doth) that yf that be the right waye / so symplye to receyue all thynge /
we maye put oute the text of scripture which warnyth vs to be wise as sarpenis. For the text followynge is sufficient / hich biddeth vs to be simple an doues. Why doth youre mastership graunt a necessa∣rye allegorye / when Paull sayth / CHRI∣STE ys a stone / or when CHRIST saith that he ys a dore? The scripture sayth he ys both twayne. And syth GOD so sayth / he ys able so to make yt. And therore by your reason we shall nede none allegorie in all scripture / & then he that is moste simple & folishe / may be co∣unted moste faythfull. And so shall we nede no faythfull fathers to expound the text / but yt shalbe moste merite / to beleue the letter. Thys I denye not / but that God could haue don yt / yf he had so entended / when he spake the wor∣des: But nowe the scrypture stondynge as yt doth / I thinke he can not do yt. As by exāple I thinke that god by the bloude of his sone Chri¦ste myght haue saued all men / both faythfull and vnfaithfull / yf he had so intended / & that yt had so pleassed him. But nowe the scripture son¦dyng as they doo / I saye he can not doo yt / and that yt is impossible for hym. For then he might Make his sone a lyer wc sayth / he tha beeueth not is dāpned.Ioan, . And againe / he that beleueth not shall not se lyffe / but the wrathe of god abideth vppō him. And euen as yt is impossible to stōde wt the proces of scriptures (wherin god hath de∣clared his will) that the vnfaithfull shulde be sa¦ued although god myght haue dō yt at the furst yf he hade so wolde. Lykewise yt ys impossible
the scriptures stōdinge as they doo / that the na¦turall bodye of Christ shulde be p̄sent to o{ur} teth in the sacramēt. And as for o{ur} fayth / yt nedeth not to haue him p̄sent in the brede. For I maye as well eate hī and drinke hym thorough fayth: that ys to saye / beleue in him / as though he we∣re as present in the sacrament / as he was hau∣gyng on y• crosse. And because you saye / that my naturall rea∣sons be not worth the reasoning. I will allege you some mo / to se what you can saye to them. Furste euery sacrament is the signe of an hollye thinge: but the sacrament of the aulter is a sacra¦ment (as all faythfull men confesse) ergo yt must follow that the sacrament of the aulter is y• syn¦ge of an hollye thinge. Nowe yf yt be the syg∣ne of an hollye thinge / then yt is not the hollye thinge yt sellfe wc yt doth signifye & represent. Why shulde we then feare / to call that bred a fi∣gure / that ys to sae / a sacrament of that holye bodye of our lord & sauiour. Besides that I wolde knowe of what necessi∣te or profite his fleshe muste be present in the sa¦crament. For the p̄sence of his fleshe can no mo∣re profit vs / then doth the remembraunce of his bodie / but this remembraunce maye as well be don by the sacramēt / as though hys bodie were present. And therfore sith God and nature ma∣ke nought in vayne / yt followethe consequent∣lye / that his naturall fleshe is not there / but on¦lye a memoriall therof. Furthermore the ende ād finall cause of a thin¦ge  is euer beter then those thinges wc are proui¦ded
for the ende (as the howse is better than the lyme / stone and timber / which are prouided for the howse) but the ende and finall cause of the sacrament is the remembraunce of Christes bo¦dye: and ther vppon yt muste followe that yf the sacramēt be his naturall bodie / that the remem¦braunce of Christes bodie shulde be better then his bodie yt sellfe Whiche thinge is to be abhor¦red of all faythfull men. It were fondenes to fayne that the soule did o¦ther wise eate then do the angellys in heuen / ād their meate is onlye e Ioye and delectatyon that they haue of god and of his glorie. And e∣uen so doth the soule wc is here vppon the yerth eate thorough fayth the bodye of Christe wc ys in heuen. For yt deliteth & reioyseth whyles y vnderstondeth thorough faith / that christ hath taken our synnes vppon him / and pacified the fathers wroth. Nether yt is necessarie that for that or for thys cause / that hys fleshe shulde be p̄sent. For a man maye as well loue and reioyse in the thinge wc ys from hym & not present / as though yt were p̄sent by him of that maner. Moreouer the brede is Christes bodye / euin as the breaking of the brede is the deth of his bodie. Nowe y• breakīge of bred at the maūdey is not the verye deth of Christes bodie / but on¦lye a representation of the same (allbeyt the min¦de thorough fayth doeth spallye beholde his ve¦rye deth) and euyn likewise that naturall brede is not the verye bodie of our lorde / but onlye a sacrament / signe / memoriall / or representatyon of this same / albe yt thorough the monision the¦rof
the mynde thorough fayth / doth spalye be∣holde the verye bodye, And surely therof yf a mā be faythfull / the sprite of God worketh in hys harte verye swetlye at his communion. Finallye / yt was not lawfull to eate or drinke the bloude not onlye of man / but also of a brute beaste / and the apostelles them selues moued by the rule of charite / did institute that men shul∣de abstayne from bloude somwhat fauorynge the infyrmyte of the Iewes. Now yf the apo∣stellys had taught (as ye doo) that in the sacra∣ment hys verye fleshe and bloud ys aten and dronke with the teth and mouthe of faythfull and vnfaythfull / what coulde haue be ne a gea¦ter occasyon to haue excluded the Iewes from crystes fayth euyn at once? Thynke you that the appostellys wolde not haue byn to scrupu∣lous to haue dronken hys very bloude / seyn∣ge yt was so playne agaynst Moses lawe / yf they had vnderstonde hym so grosselye as ye doo?ct. 10. Petr had a clothe sent downe from he∣uyn / in whych were all maner of beastes orbid¦den by the lawe / and was commaunded to se and at them. And he answered / God forbyd for I neuer eate any vnclene thynge / meanynge therbye that he neuer ate any thynge forbyd∣den by the lawe. Wherof yt moste nedes follo∣we that ether he neuer recyued the sacrament (wc ys playne false) or els that he more spiritual¦ly vnderstode the wordes of Chrises maundie then ye falselye fayne. For yt was playnely for∣bydden by the lawe / to eate or drinke any maner of bloude,ection And I knowe but one reason that
they haue wc they count an insoluble: how beyt by goddes grace we shall sone auoyde yt. There reason is this Paule sayth / he that eateth and drinketh this sacrament vnworthylye / shalbe gyltye of the bodye & bloude of the lord. Now saye they  how suld they be gyltie of the lordes bodie & bloud wc receiue yt vnworthelie / except yt were the verye bodye and bloude of the lorde This argument I saye / is verye weake & slen¦der.solution. For I can shewe many example by the wc yt may be dissolued for he that dispisseth the kin¦ges sealle or letters offendeth agaynst his owē parson / and yet the letter or seale ys not hys o∣wen parson. He that vyolently plucketh downe hys graces armes or breakyth hys brode sale wyth a furyose mynde or vyolence / commit∣teth treason agaynst hys owyn parson. And yet hys armes and brode seale are not hys owy¦ne person / he that clepyth the kyngys coyne cōmitteth treason agaynst the kynges parson and the commen welth: and yet the mony ys nether hys graces parson nor the cōmon welth And therfore your argument ys but weake and slender. For euyn as a man doth offend agayn¦ste the prynces parson by dispising hys armes / seale or letters / so doth a man offende agaynste Christes bodye and bloude / by abusynge the sa¦crament of hys bodye and bloude / although he be not there present / as the kynges parson ys not present in his armes / seale or letters. Besides that s. paule saieth that euerye mā wc praieth or p̄cheth wt couered hed shameth his he¦ed & his heed is christe: shall we therfore Imagē
that christe is naturallye in euerye mans he / as yo{ur} argument concludeth For soth that we∣re a pretye phātase. Finally S. Ausen saith that he doth no lesse synne wc negligentlye hea∣reth the worde of god / thē doth the other wc vn¦worthelye receyuith the sacrament of Christes bodye ād bloude. Nowe yf thys be true / thē ys your reason not worth a rishe / for christes na¦turall bodie ys not in the worde wc is p̄ched / as all men knowe. And yet he sunh no lesse that negligētly heareth yt / thē dooth he that vnwor¦thelye receyuyth the sacrament. And thus you see their insoluble easely dissolued. More.¶But now muste this yong mā consider agay¦ne that hym self confesseth that the cause for wt himsellf saieth that christ in so saying did so me¦ane / ys because that yf he shuld haue mēt soo / yt was impossible to god to brynge his meanenyn¦ge a bought: that ys to saye / that christes bo∣dye might be in two places at once.

More thīketh that god is called allmightie / because he can doo all thin¦ges. And then in dede yt shuld follow that he we¦re

Now yf this mās lerninge were alowed thē myght not god be allmightye / because there ys sūwhat that he cā not doo. But they that are a costomed wt scripture / do knowe that he is cal¦led almightye / not because he can doo allthing: but because ther is no superiour powere aboue hym / but that he may doo all that he wyll: & all that hys pleassure ys to doo that maye he bryn¦ge to passe / And no power ys able to resyst hym But he hath no pleassure nor wyll to make hys sone alyer ner to make hys scripture alse / & in dede he may not doo yt. And yet notwtstōding he abideth allmigtye  or he may doo all that he wil. More.Then master more touching the reason of re¦pūgnaunce sayth / that many thinges may seame repugnaunt both to him and me wc thinges god seeth how to make thē stonde to gether well yn¦ough / & addeth suche blynde reasons of repun∣gnaūce as induce manye mē in to a great errou¦re: some ascribyng all thynge vnto destenye wt oute any power of mās frewyll at all / And some geuyng all to mās owyn wyll And no fore sight at all to the prouidence of god / and all because the poore blynde reason of mā can not see so fer¦re / as to perceyue how goddes prescience and mans frewyll can stond to gether / but seme cle∣rely to be repungnant.

And then I am sure / we shuld haue fewer heretickes. For I neuer harde of heretycke that euer helde agaynste any artycle of oure Crede / but all that ye desfame / by this name / are onlye put to deth / because thei saye that we are not boūde to beleue euery poynt that the lawes and tyrannye of the clargye alo∣we and mayntene / whych thynge how true yt ys (blessed be GOD) ys meatlye well know in all readye For els had I and many mo byn deed are thys daye. I wot well that many good folke haue vsid inMore. this matt many frutefull exāples / as of one face beholden in diuerse glasses / & ī euerie pee of one glase brokē in to twenti: & of one word cominge

For they that are like our matter  make clne a¦gaynste hym / and the oher can not make for hī The glase I graunt is a good exāple. For euen as the glasse dothe rep̄sent the verie face of man so doth this sacramēt represent the vrie bodye and bloude of Christe. And like as euery pece of the glase doth represent that one face / so doth e∣uery pece of that sacrament represent that one bodye of Christe. But eury mā knoweth right well that though the glasse rep̄sent mi face / yet the substance of the glasse is not my verye face / nether is my very face in the glass. And euyn so though the sacrament do represent the bodie of Christe / yet the substance of the sacrament is not his vere bodie (no more then the glasse ys my face) nther is his verye bodye in the sacra∣mnt / no more thn my verye face is ī the glasse ād thus this example maketh well for vs. And
for that oe worde cōmyng hole to an hundreh eares / I say that worde is but a sound ād a qua¦lite and not a substance / and therfore yt is no∣thinge to our purposse / and can not be likened o Christes bodie wc is a substance & as concernin¦ge the sight of the lytle eye / I say that though the eye discrye and see an hole cōtrye / yet is not that hole contrye in the eye: but as the cōtrie is knowen by the sight of eye (though the contrye be not in yt). So is the deth of Christe and his bodye breaking and bloude shedinge knowyn by the sacrament though his naturall bodye be not in yt. And thus his examples make nothin¦ge wt him / but rather moche agaynse him. And where he sayeth that the yonge man hym sellfe can geue hī no reason / by what meane they may be don: I maye saye vnto hys mastership / that whan I was seuē yere yonger then I am his daye / I wolde haue byn ashamed yf I could not haue geuyn an euident reason at the austens in oxford before the hole vniuersite. And albeyt I now wochesaffe / not to spend labour and pa∣per abought Aristoles doctrine / yet haue I so moche touched his examples / that he may be we¦rye of them. Also I can not see why yt shuld be more re∣pugnantMore. that one bodye maye be by the power of God in two places at once / then that two bo¦dyes maye be to gether ī one place at once. And that pint I thinke this yonge an denyethe not. The beinge of our bodye in two places at on¦ce ys agenst nature / and scripture can not a lo∣weFrith:
yt. But that two bodies shuld be in one place seameth more reasonable. For I haue good expe¦rience that though my bodie can not be ī two pla¦ces at once (both in the tower & where I wolde haue yt beside) yet blessed be god in this one pla¦ce / I am not wt oue cōpanye. But yf master mo¦re meane that in one pro{per} & seuerall place / maye be two bodies at once / that I will denye / tyll he haue laiesure to proue yt. And yet at the length I am sure / hys proffe shall not be worth a po∣dyng prycke. For I am sure yt muste be, Ratione porositatis ut in igne & ferro: nā penetrationem di¦menionum nunq probabit. And then he is as ne¦re as he was before. More.Now hys laste reason wt wc he prouth yt im∣possibe for the bodye of chrite to be in two pla∣ces at once / is this: you can (sayth he) shewe no reason whye he shulde be in many places at once & not ī all. But in all places he can not be. Wher¦fore we muste cōclude that he can not be ī many places at one. This is a merelous concluded argumnt. I am sure that euery chyld maye so¦ne see that this consequent can neuer follow vp¦pon thes two premisses of tis antecedent. Frith.When I made this reason & cōpiled mi treatise I had no regard to the cauillaciōs of sote sophi¦sters: for I thought no sophisters shuld haue medled wt that meate but neuerthelesse sith now I peryne that they principallye are porynge on t / seking some praie to sett their teth a war¦ke. In this boke I haue sumwhat {pro}uided for them  ād haue brought suche harde bones / that yf they be to buse / maye chaunce to choke them
And yet is not the argument so feble as he fay∣neth. For the first part (yf he list to cōsder the sense & minde / ād be not to curious) where I saie that they can shewe no reason why he shuld be in many places & not in all  is thus to be vnder¦stōd of wise men / that the verye reason & cause / that he shuld be in manye places  muste be becau¦se the bodie is so annexed wt the godhed / that yt is in euery place as the godhed is. This I saie muste be the cause & reason of his beinge ī many places. And nether you nor no mā else cā ule assigne any other. Now of this maor or fst {pro}¦position thus vnderstond doth te cocusion fol¦low directlye. For yf this shulde be the case (as thy muste nedes graunt). And thys cause proued false by scripture: then muste they ned graunt that the thynge whiche so followeth of thys cause / muste nedes be false. And so ys my purpose proued / and they concluded As by ex∣ample / the astronomers saye: that the naturall course of the sonne ys from the west to the est. Nowe yf a man shuld aske them wat ys then the cause that we see hym daylye take the con∣trarye course / from the est to the west agayn∣ste hys nature: they answer. Beause the eyg∣hest spere (whose course ys from the est to the west) with hys swifte mouynge doth vyolntly drawe the inferio{ur} speres wt hī. This is the cau¦se that they allege / and no man can assigne any other. And now syth I can proue this sense fall¦se by scrypture. And S. Austen (for scripture sayth that the spere is fastened Hebrewes .vii Chapiter. And s. Austen expoundinge that text
improueth the astronomers wc affyrme that y moueth (syth I saye this caue y proued false by scripture / they muste nedes graunt that the thinge wc followeth of this cause muste nedes be false. And so we may conclude agaynste thē all / that the naturall course of the sonne ys not frō the weste to the st (as the astronomers saye). But contrrie from the eest to the west. And ly¦kewise syth the cause that Christes bodie shld be in many places / ys assigned of lerned men to be / because hys bodye ys so annexed wt the God¦hed (w• ys in euery place) that yt is allso ī all pla¦ces wt yt  and no mā can assygne any other. And tht this cause is proued false by scripture / for when the womn sought Christ at his graue / an angell gaue the answr that he was not there.Ma. 14. But yf his bod hd byn in euere place / then had the angell led.Luc. 6. Also Christ sayd vnto his disciples of Lazarus wc died at bathania. Laa¦rus ys dede.an. 11. And I am glade for yo{ur} sakes (that you maye beleue) because I was not ther. Now yf his bodye were in euery place as is the God¦hed / then Christ sayd not trulye / when he sayd he was not there. Therfore sith (as I sayd) this ys the cause assigned / and yet proued alse by scripture / they mste nedes graunt / that the thī¦ge wc followeth of this cause / muste also nedes be false. And so we maye cōclude agaynste them all that Christes bode is in one place onlye. And now you maye see how my consequent followe the premisses. More.For he can no farther conclude / but hat we can shewe no reason whye he shuld be in many
places at once What had he wone bi that? might he than conclude ther vppon / that he could not be in manye places at once? As though yt wre not possible for God to make hys bodye in tw places at once / but yf we wre abe to tell how / and why / and wherbye / ad shwe the reason. How far I can conclude is shewed immdiat¦ly before.Frith. For though of the bare wordes as ye toke them / yt was hard to conclude any thinge yet haue I nowe declared them / and so farre cō¦cludd / that you can not auoyde them. And whe¦re he sayth that though they can shewe no rea∣son / yet I had wōne nought by yt: I thynke he wolde be angrye yf I shuld so anser. But su∣rely they are in good case / for yt is ynough for them to saye / thus yt is / and nede neuer so she∣we any cause or reason whye they so saye. For they are the churche and can not rre: so that yf they teache contrarye thinges / yet all ys good ynough. And when they see that no man can ma¦ke the scriptures to agre wt their docrine / then they saye / that ther doctrine ys true ynough / but no man can vnderstond the scripture. And though the scripture seme neuer so repungnant both to thē ād to vs / yet god seeth well ynough (saye they) how to set them to gether / ad yt ys possible for god to make yt agree / though they can not tell how. But this doctrine hath longe ynough desayued vs. For men haue sene to lon¦ge wt yo{ur} spectacles yet now (thankes be to god) they begyn to se wt theyr own yen. And as o¦chinge how this mater was possible to god and how yt ys not possible / ys suffciently declared
before to all that liste to loke. More.How be yt as for me (though I be not bound to yt) I am content yet to proue / that god maye make the bodie of Christ to be in all places at on¦ce. And because this yonge man coupleth that proposityon wt the tother: so wyll I do to. And I proue therfore that god can make hys bodye be bothe in many paces at once / and in all pla∣ces at once / by that that he ys almightye / & ther¦fore can do all tynge. Frith:ow is the good man in his olde dreame agai¦ne  and thinketh that god is called almightye / because he can do all thinges. And then in dede yt suld olowe that he were not almghtie. For all thīges he can not doo  he can not saue the vn¦faythfull / he cā not restore / vginitye once viola¦ted / he can not sinne: he can not denie hym sellfe. Now yf this mans lerninge were alowed / than might not god be called almightie / because there is sumwhat that he can not doo. But they that are accustomed wt scripture / do knowe that h is called almightie / not because he cā not do all thin¦ges / but because ther is no superio{ur} power aboue hym / but that he may do all that he will / and all that hys pleassure ys / maye he brynge to pase. But he hath no wyll / pleasure nor power to ma¦ke his sone a lyer and to make his scripture fal¦se / and yet natwtstonding he abydeth almightye and may do what he will. And euyn as yt is im¦possible to stōde wt the processe of the scriptures (wher in god hath declared his will) that the vn¦faythfull shuld be saued (although at the fyrste god might haue dō yt / yf he had so wolde) likewi¦se
it is impossible the scriptures stōdīge as they doo / that the naturall bodie of christ  shuld be pre¦sent to o{ur} teth ī the sacramēt. And as for o{ur} faith yt nedeth not to haue hī p̄sent in the bred. For I maye as well eate hī & drinke him / thorough faith (that is to saie / beleue in hī) though he con¦tinue sill in heuyn / as though he were as p̄sent in the sacramēt / as he was hāging on the crosse But yet his mastership hathe lefte ne thīge vn¦proued / & that is euin the pith of his purposse. For though he had {pro}ued (as he hath not) that God bi hys almightines might make Christs bodie in many places / & in all places / ād in the sa¦cramēt / yet he forgotte to {pro}ue that god hath so done. And therfore albeyt I did graūt him (as I will not) that he might so doo / yet therof yt doh not followe / that he hath so dō in dde. For god maye do many thinges wc he doth not. And ther¦fore his argumēt doth not {pro}ue his purpose Now yf he do but thinke that god hath so don / I am well pleased and wyll not put hym to th payne to {pro}ue yt. For anon ye shall se hī so intāgled in briars / that he shall not wette where to be come But et this yonge man gooeth aboute to pro¦ue the poynt by scripture.More For except we graūt him that poynt to be true / he saeth that is we make the angell a lyar that sayd / he is not he∣re / and also that els we make as though Chry∣stes bodye in his assension did not goo vp in the cloude in to heuyn from yeth but onlie hid him selfe in the cloude / and playeth boo pipe and tay¦ried beneth still here in the ede he forgetteth hī sellfe so fowle / that whan he was a iōge sophiser
he wolde I dare saye / haue yn full sore ashame so to haue ouer sene hym sellfe at oxford at a per¦uise. For ye wott well that thinge wc he sayeth / and wc he muste therfore proue / is that the bodie of Christe can not be in euery place at once bi no meane that god could make. And the textes that he bringth in for the proffe / saye no furder but that he was not in all places at once. Frith.There are two thinges disputed betwene ma¦ster more & me: the one is whether god can make the bodye of Christe in manye paces / & in the sacrament. And therto his mastership sayth ye. For god is allmightye and maye do all thynges. And I saye naye / and affyrme that GOD ys not called almightye because he maye do all thin¦ges but because he maye do all that he will / and I sae that he will not make hs sonne a lyear nor his scripture false / and that he can not do yt and yet abydeth almightye. The tother thynge is this / whether he haue done yt or not. For al∣beit I did graunt him that yt were possible / yet ys he nuer the nere / xcpt he other can proue that he hath done yt in dede / or els thinke that god hath so done. For as I sayd god can do ma¦nye thinges wt he doth not. And the controuer∣se of this doubte is dissolued by the angell and scripture wt (as mster more graunteth hym sell¦fe) proueth that he was not in all places at once And therof yt followeth / that god hath not don yt / although yt be possible. And so is his master¦shype at a poynt. For yf I shuld graunte yt ne¦uer so possible / yet yf scripture proue that yt be not so in dede / then is he neuer the nere his pur¦pose
/ but moche the furder from yt. And thys y euyn yt that I sayd before: that yt was not pos¦sible to stonde wt the processe of the scripture wc we haue receiued. And now his mastership hath graunted yt himsellf / which you maye be sure he wold not doo yf he coulde otherwise auoyde yt And here you maye se howe sore I haue ouer se¦ne my sellfe. God forbid that any man shuld be the moreMor prone & readye to beleue thys yonge mā in this great mater / because he sayeth in the begynyng that he wyll brynge all men to a concord and a∣quietnes of conscience. For he bryngeth men to the worst kinde of quietnes that may be deuised when he telleth vs as he doth / that euery mā in this mater / maye wt oute parell beleue whyche waye he lyste, Euery man maye in euerye mater wt oute any counsell / sone set hym sellfe at rea∣ste / yf he lyste to take that waye and to beleue as he list hym sellfe / and care not how But and yf that waye had byn sure / S. Paule wolde ne∣uer haue shewed that manie were in parell of se¦kenes and deth to. For lacke of discernynge re∣uerently the bodye of our lorde in that sacramēt when they came to receyue hym. When Christe shulde departe this worlde &Frith. goo to his father he gaue his disciples a comma¦undemētIoan. 1 that they shuld loue eche other / sayin¦ge by this shall all men knowe / that ye are my disciples / yf ye loue eche other / as I haue loued you. This rule of charite wold I not haue bro¦ken / wc notwtstondyng ys often in Ieopardie a¦mōge faythfull folke / for this sacramēt of vnite
This thynge conered / I thought necessarye / to aduertise both partyes to saue thys rule of charite / and proued in the fyrste chapter of my treatise / that yt was none article of the fayth necessarie to be beleued vnder payne of dāpna∣cion / and thrfore that they were to blame that wolde be contencious for the mater. For sith yt ys non article of the fayth / they maye lawfullye dissent wt oute all Ieoperdye: & nede not to brea¦ke the rule of charite / but rather to receyue eche other like weake brethern. As by exāple / some thīke that the mariage betwene o{ur} moste redoub¦td prince ād quen kateryn is lawfull and maye stonde wt the lawes of god: and some thinke that yt is vnlawfull & ought to be disanulled. Now if we shuld for this maer breake the rule of cha¦rit / and euery mā hae his neighboure that wol¦de not thynke as he doth / then were we greatly to blame & in Ieoperdie of cōempnacion. This I saye I proued in the fyrst chapter againste wc more maketh no busines / and improueh yt not Wherbye you maye sone gather that yt is ve∣rye true. For els sith hys mastership so labou∣reth in thesse other poynts / he wold not haue lefte that vntouched / you maye be sure. This is the concord that I wolde bringe thē vnto. And as touchynge quietnes of conscience / I haue knowen manye that haue sore byn cōbured wt it And amōge all / a certayne master of arte which dyed in oxforth / confessed vppon his deth bed / that he had wept lying in hys bed an hundreth nyghtes with in one yere space / because he coul¦de not beleue yt. Now yf he had knowen / yt had
byn no necessarye article / what comfort & quy∣etnes shuld yt haue byn vnto him. Furthermo¦re euery man can not so quyet hymsellf / as ma∣ster more Imageneth. For there are many that thynke thē sellfes no smalle foles / wc whā they haue receyued some folishe superstitiō / ether bi ther owyn Imaginacyō / or by bleuinge ther gosshepes gospell & olde wyffes tales by & bye thynke the contrarye to be dedly synne / and v¦terly for bydden by chrystes gospell. As by exāple / I knowe an house of relegyō / wherin is a person that thynketh yt dedly synne / to goo ouer astrawe yf it ley acrosse. And yf ther be on the pauemēt any paynted picture or any Ima∣ge grauē on a deed mās graue / he wyl not trede vppon yt / although he shuld goo a forelonge a¦boute. What ys thys but vayne supersticyon wherewt the cōscience ys combred & corrupted? May not this be weded oute with the worde of god / shewyng him that it ys none article of the fayth so to thinke / and then to tell hym that yt ys not forboden by the scripture / and that yt is no synne? Now albeit hys cōsciēce be so cākerd that the ruste wyll not be rubbed oute: yet with godes grace / some other whom he hath enfecte with the same / maye come agayne to godes wor¦de and be ured full well / wc shuld neuer haue byn able to quiete themsellffes. And lyke wise there are some which beleue as your supperstici¦ous hartes haue informed them / and these can not quiet them selues / because they beleue that you haue et your doctryne out of scrypture / But whē yt ys proued to thē / & they thēselues
{per}eyue that scripture sayeth not so / thē cā they be cōtent to thinke the cōtrarye / & Iudge yt no synne at all And as touchyng S. Paule / suere¦lye ye take hym wrong. For I wyll shew you what {pro}cesse he taketh / & howe he his to be vn∣derstōd. But because yt is not possible to fynys¦he it in fewe wordes / I shall deferre it vnto the bokes ende / ād thē I shall declare hym at large. MoreAnd what a faciō ys this / to saye that we ma¦ye beleue yf we list / that there ys the verye bo∣dye of our lorde in dede / and thē to tell vs for a trouth / that suche a fayth ys impossble to be∣true: For god hym sellfe can neuer brynge yt a∣bought / to make hys bodye be there. Frith.Yf a mā take the bare wordes of christe / & of simplicite be deceyued / ād thinke that his veri bodye be in the sacrament present to their teth that ate yt / I dare not saye that he sinneth the¦rin / but will referre te matter vnto godes Iud¦gemēt / & yet wt oute doubt / I dare saye he ys de¦ceyued. As by example / yf a mā deceyued bi the leterall sense / wold thynge that men shuld prea¦che to fyshes (as S. Fraūces did) because christ bade his disciples goo preache to all creatures / yet wolde not I thynke that he synned therin / But wyll referre hym vnto goddes Indgemēt. But yet I wene euerye woman that hath any wyte / wyll saye that he was deceyued. I am verye sure that the olde holye doctours More.wc beleued christes bodye ād bloode to be there / ād so taught other to beleue / as by ther bokes playnlye doth apere. Yf they had thought ether that it could not be there or that yt was not the¦re
in dede / they wold not for all the good in this worlde haue wryten as they haue done. For wold thosse holye men (wene you) haue taught that mē be boūd to beleue / that the verye bodie and bloude of christe ys there / yf them sellfe thought they were not bounde there to? wolde they make mē honoure and worship that thyn∣ge as the very bodye and bloude of christe whi¦che them sellues thought were not yt? this ge∣e ys to chyldishe to speake of. That the olde douctoures & faythfull fathers so taught or thought as ye fayne of thē / ys ve∣rye false.Frith For s. Austen as I haue shewed / ma∣keth whollye for vs. Besides that / there is none o the old fathers but they call yt a sacrament a misterie and misticall meate / wc is not eaten wt toth or belye: but wt cares and fayth. And tou∣chinge the honour and worship done vnto yt. I saye yt is plaine Idolatrye. And I saye / that he falselye reporteth on the olde holie doctoures. For they neuer taught men to worshyp yt / nether can he allege one place in any of them all which wolde haue men to worship the sacrament. Per¦aduenture he maye allege me certayne new fel∣lowes for hys purposse / as dunce / Dorbell / du∣rand and suche draffe wc by ther doctryne haue drenched the worlde with dampnable Idolatrie But I speake of the olde holye fathers and do∣ctours Sainct Austen / Ambrose / Hirom / Cy∣rian / Cirille / Chrisostome / Fulgentius / and suche other: these I saye / do not teache men to worship yt / and by that I dare abyde. Of thys oint I am so sure / that I will vse yt for a con¦trarye
argumēt / that his naturall bodye is not there present. For yf the holie fathers before na¦myd had taken this text after the letter and not only spūallye / then in there workes they wolde haue taught mē to worshipe yt but they neuer taught men to worship this sacrament / therfo∣r yt followeth they toke not the text after the lttr / but onlye spūallye. Now do I prouoke you to seke a profe of yo{ur} purposse. Neuerthe¦lesse I will not deney / but that these holy doctou¦res in dyuerse places / do calle yt his bodie / as christ & paule doo / and so do we lykewise: & sa¦ye aso that hys very bodie ys there eaten. But yt we meane / that it ys eatē wt fayth (that is to saye by beleuing that hys bodye was brokē for Notevs) & haue hys bodye more in memorie at this maundye thē the meate that we there eate.☞ And therfore yt hathe the name of his bodie: because the name yt sellfe shulde put vs in remembraū∣ce of hys bodye / And that hys bodye ys there chflye aten / uyn more (thorongh fayth) then the mate with the mouth. And so are they also to be vnderstond. More.Yet one great pleasure he doth vs / in that he utteth vs all at lybertye / that we maye wt ou∣te parell of dampnacyō beleue as we did before: that ys to witte / that in the blessed sacramēt the whole substāce of the bred ād the wyne is trās∣mted & chaunged in to the verye bodie & blou¦de of christe. For if we maye with oute parell of dampnacyon beleue thus / as hym selle graun¦teth that we maye / thē graūteth he that we ma¦ye allso wt oute parell of dampnacyō beleue that
hym sellf lyeth / where he sayeth / the trouth of that beleue ys impossible. The beleuynge of this poynt / is of yt self notFrith. dāpnable as it ys not dāpnable to thynke that christe ys a very stone or auyne / because the le∣terall sense so sayeth: or yf you beleue that you ought to preache to fyshes and goo christen thē a nother whyle / as ye do belles. And I insure yow / if there were no worse mischef that ensued of this beleue / thē yt ys in yt selfe / I wolde ne¦uer haue spokē agaynst yt. But now there fol∣loweth vppō yt dampnable Idolatrye. For tho¦rough the beleue that thys bodye ys there / mē fall downe and worshipe yt / And thynking to pleasse god / do dāpnable synne agaynst hī This I saye / ys the cause that I so ernestly wryte a∣gaynste yt / to auoyde the Idolatrye that ys cō¦mitted thorough yt. Parte of the germanes do thynke that hys naturall bodye ys present in the sacrament & take the wordes fleshelye / as martē taught thē. But none of thē worship yt for that martē forbedeth both in his wordes ād workes / & so blessed be god they auoyde that Ie¦operdie wc thinge yf you wyll allso graūt & pu∣blishe☜ but this one proposityon / that yt ought not to be worshipped / I promise you I wyll ne¦uer wryte agaynste yt. For thē is the Ieoperdie taken awaye / and then I am content that your mastership thynke I lye. But in the meane sea¦son I muste thynke that ye fulfyll the wordle with dampnable Idolatrye. And thus haue you allso answer vnto the conclusyon which you allege oute of the kynges graces boke.
For I saye in your waye ys no hurte / as longe as you doo but onlye beleue the bare wordes of h text (as S. Fraunces did / when he preached to fishes. But yf thorough the occasion of thosse wordes / ye falle in to the worshypynge of yt / then I saye that in your waye ys vndoubted dampnacyon. And so ys there great Ieopardie in your waye / & non at all in oures. For though he were there in dede / yet do not we synne yf we worship yt not / for we are not commaunded to worship the sacrament. But yf he be not there / then do you dampnable Idolatrye. ¶The consecracyon of the Sacrament. More.NOw as for a nother quiet∣nes of euery mans cōsciens this yongman byddeth eue¦ry man be bolde / whether the blessed sacrament be cō¦secrate or vnconsecrate (for though he moste specyallye speaketh of the wyne / yet he speaketh yt of both) and byddeth not are / but take yt for all that vnbles¦sed as yt ys because the prest (he sayeth) cā not deceyue vs nor take from vs the profiet of chri¦stes insitucion / whether he alter the wordes or leaue them all on sayd. Is not thys a wōderfull doctrine of this yonge man. We wotte well all / that the prest can not hurte vs by his ouersight
or malice / yf there be no faulte vppō oure owin partye / for that perfectyon that lacketh on the prestes parte / the great mercye of god as we tru¦ste of hys owyn goodnes supplyeth. And ther∣fore as holye Chrisostome saieth / no man can ta¦ke harme but of himselfe. But now yf we se the thynge disordered oure owyn sellfe by the prest and Christes institucion broken / yf we thā wit¦tingly receyue yt vnblessed and vnconsecrated / and care not whether christes instituciō be kept and obserued or no / but reakon yt is as good wt oute yt as wt yt / then make we our sellffes par∣takers of the faute and lese the profyte of the sa¦crament / and receyue yt wt dampnacyon: not for the prestes faute / but for oure owyn. I had thought that no turke wolde haue wre¦stedFrith. a mannes wordes to vnfaythefullye for he leauith oute all the pith of mi mater for my wor¦des are these. I wyll shew you a meanes how ye shall euer receyue yt according to Christes in∣stitucion / although the prest wolde wt drawe yt frō you. Fyrst ye nede to haue no respecte vnto the prestes wordes wc ministreth yt. For yf ye re¦mēber for what entent Christ did institute this sacrament / and knowe that yt was to put vs in remembraunce of hys bodye breakynge & bloud sheding / that we might geue him thankes for yt and be as sure of yt thorough faith accordinge to his promises / as we are sure of the brede bea¦tinge of yt: yf as I saye / ye remember this thyn¦ge (for wc intent only the preste speaketh those wordes) then yf the prest leue oute those wor∣des or parte therof / he can not hurte you. For
you haue all readie the effecte ād finall purpose for the wc he shuld speake thē. And againe yf he shuld whollie altre thē yet he cā not deceiue you For then ye be sure that he is a lyear / ād though you se the prest brynge you the wine vncōsecra¦ted yet neuer sticke at that. For as surelye shall yt certifie youre cōscience and outwarde senses hough he cōsecrate yt not (so thou cōsecrate yt th sellf that ys to saye / so thou know what ys ment therbye and geue hym thākes) as though he made a thoussand blessynges ouer yt. And so I saye that yt is euer consecrated in hys harte that beleueth / though the prest cōsecrate yt not. And contrarye wyse yf they cōsecrate yt neuer so muche  and thy cōsecracion be not bye / yt hel¦peth the not a rishe. For except thou knowe what ys ment therby / and beleue / geuinge than¦kes for his bodye breakinge and bloudshedyn∣ge / yt can not profyte the. MoreNowe where you saye / that yf we se the thin¦ge disordered by the prest / & Christes institucy¦on broken / & wyttinglye receyue yt / we make o{ur} selffes partakers of the cryme. Frith.I answer that yf the reformacyon therof laye in o{ur} hādes / then sayd you trouth / but sith this ys writin to priuate parsones wc maye not re∣forme this mater / and that the reformacyō ther¦of reasteth onlye in the hande of your prince ād parliament (for the erroure cōsisteth not in the misorderyng of the mater by one prest onlie but rather of the doctrine of thē all / sauyng suche as god hath lightened) to thes p̄uate {per}sons I saye that youre doctrine shuld soner be the occasion
of an insurrexion wc we labour to eshew) then ¦ny quietinge of them by Christes doctrine. And therfore syth there ys an other waye to wode / sauyng all vpright / we wyll auoyde that pary∣lous pathe. But when ye se Christes institucy¦on broken and y• one kynd left out vnto ye laye peple / why ar ye partaker therof? How be yt as for his beleue that taketh yt noMore. better but fore bare bred & wine yt maketh him lytell matter cōsecrated or not / sauynge that the better yt is consecrated the more yt is euer noy¦ous to him that receyuyth yt hauinge his cōsci¦ens combred wt suche an execrable heresie / by wc well aperreth that he putteth no defference be∣twene the bodye of our lorde in the blessed sacra¦ment / and the comon brede that he eatyth at hys dynner / But rather he estemeth yt lesse. For the tone yet I thynke or he begyn / yf he lacke a prest / he wyll blesse yt hym sellfe / the to¦ther he careth not as he sayeth / whether yt be blessed or no. What I reaken yt more then bred and wyneFrith. I wyll shew you here after in declarynge the mynde of S. paule vppon thys sacrament / and that in the conclusion of this boke. And in the meane season I will saye no more but that he be lyeth me. And as for there blessinges & cōsecra∣cion profite not me / except I cōsecrate yt my sel¦fe with fayth in Christes bloude / and with ge∣uynge hym prayse and thankes for hys inesti∣mable goodnes / which when I was his enemie reconciled me vnto his father bi his owin deth This consecracy  muste I set by yt / yf I will
haue any profyete of his deth wc the sacrament representeth vnto me. And yf I my self do thus consecrate yt / then shall I be sure of the frute of his deth. And I saye againe / that as the prestes do now vse to cōsecrrate yt / yt helpeth not the poore comēs of a rishe. For there cōsecraciō shuld stonde in preachinge vnto thē the dethe of chri¦ste wc hath delyuered them oute of the Egypt of synne and from the fyry fornace of Pharo the de¦uell. And as for theyr wagginge of ther fingers ouer yt / and sayng, vi. or .vij. wordes in laten / helpeth them nothing at all for how can they be¦leue by the meanes of his wordes whē they kno¦we not what he sayeth? And as touchinge the co¦men breade that I eate at my dynner / whether I haue a preste or not / I blysse yt wt my harte (and not wt my fyngers) and hartely geue God thankes for yt. For yf I haue an hundreth pre¦stes to blesse yt / yet am not I excused therbye. For except I blesse yt my sellfe / yt profiteth me no more then yf yt were vnblessed. And yf I bles¦se yt my sellfe / than I care not what the preste prate. For as longe as I vnderstonde hym not yt profiteth me nothinge. But in good faieth I wene the bushoppes & ther proctoure wte not what a blessinge meaneth. Therfore deare bre∣thern hearkyn to me. To blysse god / ys to geue him praise and thankes for his benefites: to blis¦se a kynge or a prence / is to thanke him for hys ☞kindenes / and to praye to god for hym / that he maye longe reigne to the lawde of god ād welth of his cōmens.To blesse To blisse a mans neyghboure ys to praye for him and to doo hym good. To blisse
my brede or meate / is to geue god thākes for yt To blysse my sellfe / is to geue god thāke for the great benefites that I haue receyued o him / & to pray god that of his infinite goodnes he will increase those gyftes that he hath geuin me and fynishe his worke wc he hath begon in me / vnto his lawde and prayse / and as touching this fles¦he / to fullfyll his will in yt / and not to spare yt but scorge / cut and burne yt: onlye that yt maye be to his honore and glorie. This ys the forme of blessynge / and not to wage two fyngers ouer them. But a lacke / of thys blessing our bushop∣pes be ignorant.

But yf yt teache me suche thinges as wyll not stond wt his worde / then wyll I deter∣myne that yt ys done by the deuell / to deiude the people wt damnable Idolatrye.Acte. 24. When Paule and Barnabas preached at Lystra and had don a myracle emonge them / the people ranne and wold haue don sacrifice vnto them. But the apo¦stles ranne amonge them and are their clothes cryinge vnto them / syrs what you doo? we are euyn corruptible men as ye are and preache vn∣to you / that you shuld laue this vayne supersti¦tion / & worship the leuynge god / wc made heuen erth / the see / & all that in thē &c. here the apostel¦les refused suche hono{ur} & worship. And therfore I am sure they wolde not suffer ther Images to haue yt Now whē I see a miracle done at any Image / & {per}ceyue that yt brīgeth men to the wor¦shipping of yt sellfe / cōtrarye to the facte & doctri¦ne of the apostelles / whiche wold not receyue yt thē selues / I must nedes cōclude / that yt is but a delusiō done by the deuell to deceiue vs & to brī¦ge the wrath of god vppō vs. Euin soo I saie of the sacramēt / sith the miracles that are done by yt / do make mē thīke otherwise then scripture will / & cause mē to worship yt: I doubte not but they are done by the deuell / to delude the people Thou wilt {per}auenture saie that god will not suf¦fer him to abuse the sacramēt of his bodie & blou¦de. Yes verelye / god will suffer yt / and doth suffer yt / to see whether we will be faithfull ād abide by his worde or not. And meruell not ther
of / for god suffered hym to take vppe the veryMath. 4 naturall bodye of his sonne Christ and set hym on a pynnacle of the temple. And after he toke hym vppe agayne / and leade him to an exceding mountaine. And therfore thīke not but that he hath moe power ouer the sacramēt then he hade ouer Christes owyn bodie. And therfore when they tell me / loo here is christ: oo there is christ (as Christ prophecyed) loo he is at this auitre loo he is at that / I will not beleue them. Neuerthelesse yf I shuld graunt that all the myracles whyche were done / and ascrybed vn∣to the sacrament / were very true miracles ād do¦ne of god himsellf (as I doubt not but some of them be true) yet there vppon yt doth not olo∣we that the Sacrament shulde be the verye, na¦turall bodie of Christe. For we haue euydent stories that certayne persones haue byn deliue¦red frō bodelye diseases thorough the sacramēt of baptime. And yet the watter is not the holye gost nor the very thinge yt sellfe wherof yt is a sacrament.Actes.  The shadow of Peter hath healed many. And yet was not that shadow Peters o¦wyn person We reade also that napkyns & hād herchers were caryed from Paule vnto themActes. 1 that were syke and possessed wyth vnclene spire¦tes / and they receyued ther helth. And yet yt were neuerthelesse madnes / to thinke that Pau¦les bodye had byn actuallie or naturallie in thos¦se thynges. And therfore thys ys but a verye weake reason / to Iudge by the myracles the pre¦sence of Chrystes bodye. And surelye you mought be ashamed to make so slender reasons.
For god maye worke miracles thorough many thinges wc are not his naturall bodye. And as touchinge the olde doctoures whom you fayne to make wt you / and the trouth of your opinyon wc you saye hath byn beleued of all good christē pople this .xv.C. yeres / is suffecyentlye decla¦red before / & proued to be but a poynt of your old poetrye. ¶Doctoure barnes did graciou¦slye escarpe master mores hādes More,ANd also frere barnes albe∣yt that as ye wett well he is in many other thinges a brother of this youngmās secte: yet in thys heresie he sore aborreth his heresye or els he lyeth hym sellfe. For at his laste beinge here he wrote a letter to me. Wherin he writeth that I laie that heresie wron¦gfullye to his charge. And shewyth him sellfe so sore greued therewt that he sayeth / he will ī my reproche make a boke agaynst me. Wherin he wyll professe & proteste his fayth concernynge this blessed sacrament, But in the meane season yt well contenteth me / that frere barnes beyng a man of more age. And more rype discrecyon & a doctour of diuinite / and in those thinges bet∣ter lerned then this yongmā ys / abhorreth this yongmānes heresie in this poynt / as well as he

For in many poītes he doth cōdēpne yo{ur} dānable do¦ctrine / as in his boke apereth. And therfore if su¦che credēce must be geuē to him / then moche the lesse will be geuin to you. But {per}aduenture you will saye / that he is to be beleued in this poynt / although he erre in other. Wher vnto I answer that yf you will cōsent vnto him I wolde be well☜ apayd and will promise you to wryt no more in that mater. For in thys we both agre / that yt ought not to be worshipped (ye and blessed be god all the other whom you calle heretyckes).

For lett yt not be wor∣shipped / and thinke as yow will: for then is the parell paste. And sith we agre in thys poynt / doubt not but we shall sone agre in the residou and admitte eche other for faythfull brothers. And where yo{ur} mastership sayeth / that he wrot you a letter protetinge that you laye that here¦sie wrongfullye to his charge. I thinke yt was more wisdom for hym twise to haue wryten to you / then once to haue comen and tell you of yt. For yt was playnly told hym / that you had con¦spiryd his deth / ād that notwtstondinge his saf¦fe conduyte / you were minded to haue murthe∣red hym.

And blessed be god you haue suffeciētye pub¦lyssed your purposse in your answer agaynst W tindale / where you saye / that you myght lawful¦lye haue brune hym.

But here he wold saye vnto me as he dethe in his boke / that he had forfayted his saffe cōduy¦te ād therbye was fallyn in to his enemyes han¦des. Where vnto I answer / that this yo{ur} sayin¦ge is but a vayne glose.

But master more hath ler∣ned of hys masters our p̄lates (whose procture he ys / to depresse oure princes p̄rogatiue) that men ought not to kepe any promisse wt heretyc∣kes. And so his safe cōduyte cold not saue hym As though the kynges grace myght not admit¦te any mā to goo and come frelye in to hys gra¦ces realme / but that he muste haue leue of our p̄¦lates.

The paschal lambe and oure sacrament are here com¦pared to gether. NOw we shall shortly expres¦se the pith of our mater and borow the figure of the pas¦chall lambe. Which is in all poītes so lyke. That the of¦feringe of the pascall lambe did signyfye the offerynge of Christes bodye / is play∣ne by Paule which sayeth Christe our paschall lambe ys offered vp for vs 1. Cor. 5.When the childern of Israell were very sad and heuye for theyr sore appressyon vnder the po∣wer of Pharrao (for the mo myracles were she¦wed / the worse were they handeled). God sent vnto them by oyses / that eury howsold shuld kyl a lambe to be a sacrifyce vnto GOD and that they shuld eate hym / with their staues in their handes / ther loynes gyrded and sho∣wes on their feee: euin as men that were going an hastye Iorney. Thys lambe muste they eate hastelye and make a merye maundye. Now be∣cause thy shuld not saye / that they could not be merye For ther oppressyon / and what coul∣de the lambe help them: he added glad tydyn∣ges vnto yt and sayd / thys ys the passing bye of the lorde. Whiche thys nyght shall passe by you and e all the fyrste begotton / with in the Lond of Egipt / and shall delyuer you oute of
your bondage / and brynge you in to the lond that he hath promissed vnto yo{ur} fathers. Mar∣ke the processe and conueyaunce of thys mter / for euyn lyke wisse yt is in our sacramēt. The a¦posteles were sad & heuye / partlye considering the bōdage of synne werwt they were oppressed & partlye because he told thē that he muste depu¦te frō thē in whō they did put all their hope ofIoan. 1. ther deliueraunce. Wyle the were in this he∣uynes / Christ thought to cōfort them & to geue them the seale of their delyueraunce / ād toke in his hande bred / blessed and brake yt / and gaue yt to his disciples sayinge: this is my bodye wc shalbe geuyn for you. For this nyght shall the power of pharo the dewell be distroyed / and to morow shall you b deliuered from the egipt of synne  and shall take your iourneye towardes that heuenlye mansion which ys prepared of of god for all that loue hym. Now compare thē to gether. The paschal lambe was institute and eaten the night before the chyldern of Israell were in dede delyuered from egipt, Like wise was the sacrament institute & eaten the night before we were deliuered from our sinnes. The paschal lambe was a verye lambe in dede And so is the sacrament very brede in dede. The paschl lābe was called the passynge bye of the lorde which distroyed the power of pha∣ro & delyuered thē. The sacrament is called the bodie of the lorde which distroyed the power of the deuell and delyuered vs. ¶ As manny as did eate the pascal lambe
in fayth / were very merye and gaue god great thankes. For they were sure the next daye to e deliuered oute of egypt / as many as did eate his sacrament in fayth / were merye and gaue God great thankes / for they were sure the next daye to be deliuered from there synne. They that did not eate the paschal lambe in fayth / could not be merye. For they were not su¦re of deliuerāce from the powre of pharo. They that did not eate this sacrament in fayth / could not be mery: For they were n sure of deliuerā¦ce from the power of the deuell. They that beleued the worde of the lorde did more eate the passinge bye of the lorde wc shuld deliuer them / then they did the lābe. They that dide beleue the worde of the lorde did more eate the bodye of the lorde wc shulde be geuin for their deliueraunce / then they did the bred. For that thinge doth a man moste eate that he moste hath in memorie and moste reuolueth in minde: as ap¦pereth by Christe Ioan. 4. I haue meate to ea∣te that ye knowe not, They that beleued not the next daye to be de∣lyuered  from Egypt / did not eate the passynge bye of the lorde / although they eate the lamme. They that beleued not the next daye to be dely∣uered from synne did not eate the bodye of the lord / although they eate the bred The chylderne of Israell were but onece dely¦uered from Egypt / natwtstondinge they did eue¦ry yere eate the lambe / to kepe that facte in perpe¦tuall remembraunce. Eun so Christ bought ād redemed vs but once for all and was offered ād
sacreficed but once for all though ye sacrament therof be daylie broken amonge vs to kepe ye be¦nefite in continuall memorye. As manye as did eate the paschal lābe in faith and beleued godes worde as touchinge their de¦liueraunce from Egypt / were as sure of their de¦liueraunce thorough fayth / as they were sure of the lābe by eatinge yt. As many as doo eate this sacramēt in fayth & beleue godde worde as tou¦chinge their deliueraunce from synne / are as su¦re of ther deliuerance thorough fayth / as they  are sure of the brde by eatinge yt. As many as did eate of that paschal lambe did magnifie their god / testifienge that he onlie was the god allmightie / and they his people styckin∣ge to hym / to be deliuered by his power from all daūger. As manie as doo eate of this sacramēt do magnifie theyr god testifying that he ōlie is the god allmightiy & they his people styckinge by hī to be deliuered by his power frō all dāger. Whē the Israelytes were deliuered frō egipt / they eate neuerthelese the paschal lambe wc was styll called the passing bye (because yt was the remembraunce of the passing bye of the lorde) and hertelye reioysed / offering him sacrifice and knoweleginge wt infinite thankes / that they we¦re the fellowship of them that had suche a merci¦full god, Now Christes electe are deliuered frō synne / they eate neuerthelesse the sacramēt wc is styll called his bodye that once dyed for their de¦liuerance / and hartelye reioyse / offeringe to hī the sacrifice of prayse & knowelegen wt infinite thankes / that they are of the fellowship of them
that haue suche a mercifull GOD. The paschal lambe after their deliueraunce yt was yerlye eaten / brought as moche myrth & Io¦ye vnto thē that did eate yt in faith / as yt ded to their athers wc felt pharo his furie / & were not yet delyuered. For they knewe ryght well that except god of his mercye and wonderfull power had so deluered them they shuld also them sell∣fes haue byn bonde in the londe of Egpt and vnder that wicked prince Pharo / of wc bonda∣ge they greatlye reioysed to be rid all readye / & thanked God helye because they founde them sellfes in that plentuose Londe wc god prouided for thē. The sacramēt wc after oure delyueraun¦ce is yerlye & daylye eaten / bringyth as muche myrth & Ioye vnto vs that eate yt in faith / as it did to the apoteles wc were not yet deliuered. For we knowe right well that except god of his merce and thorough the bloude of hys sonne / had so deluered vs / we shuld also o{ur} sellffes ha¦ue byn bounde in the egit of synne vnder that wicked prince the deuill / of wt bondage we gre∣atly reioyse to be ryd all redye / and thāke God hyelye because we fynde our sellues in the state of grace & haue receiued thorough faith the first ructes & a taste of the spiret wc testifyeth vnto vs that we are y• childern of God. This maundie of remembraunce was yt that paule receyued of the lorde & deluered to the co¦rinthians in the .xi. chaptre. For though he bo¦rowe one propertie and similitue of the sacra∣mēt in th, x. chapter / that in my mynde maketh nether wt vs nor agaynst vs / albeit som thinke
that yt maketh hole for the exposiciō of christes wordes / this is my bodie.1. Cor 1 But in my minde they are deceyued. or the occasion that paule spake of yt in the .x. chapter was this. The Corinthi¦ans had knowelege that all meates were indiffe¦rent and whther yt were offered to an Idole or not / that th meate was not the worse / and that they myght lawfullye eate f yt / whether yt were solde them in the shambles or set before thm when they dyned or souped in an vnfaith¦full mānes howse / askynge no questyons: except some man dyd tell them that yt was offerred to an Idolle / and then they shulde not ate of yt for offendynge hys conscyence that so told them (albe yt they were els fre and the thynge indif¦ferent) thys knowelege because yt was not an∣nexed wyth charyte was the occasyon of great offendyng. For by reason therof they sate dow¦ne amonge the gentyles at there feastes / Wher they eate in the honour of their Idolles / and so dyd not onlye wounde the conscyens of their weake bretherne / but also committed Ido¦latrye / in dede: And therfore s. paule sayd vnto thē.Paule My deare beloued fle frō worshyppinge of idolles.☜ I speake vnto th wc haue discreciō Iud¦ge ye what I saye. Ys not the cup of blessing wc we blysse the fellowship of the bloude of christe? ys not the brede wc we breake the fllowship of the bodie of Christe? For we though we be ma∣nye are yet one bred and one bodye / in as moche as we are partakers of one bred. Christ did cal¦le hym sellfe bred and the brede hys bodye: And here Paule calleth vs bred & the brede o{ur} bodye
Now maye you not take Paule that he in this place shuld derectly expound Christis mynde. And that the verie exposicion of Christes wor¦des / whē he sayd this is my bodye / shuld be that yt was the fellowship of his bodye (as some saie wc sekynge the kaye in this place of paule locke them sellffes so faste in / that they can fynde no waye oute) For Christe spake those wordes of his owyn bodye wc shulde be geuyn for vs / but the fellowship of Christes dodye (or congrega∣cyō) was not geuyn for vs. And so he ment not as Pule here sayeth / but ment hys owyn bo∣dye. For as Paule calleth the bred oure bodye for a certayne propertie / euyn so doth Chryste calle yt his bodye for certayne other properties In that the brede was broken / yt was christes owyn bodye signifying that as that bred was broken / so shulde his bodye be brokyn for vs. In that yt was distributed vnto his disciples yt was his owyn bodie / signifyinge that as ve¦relye as that bred was destribted vnto them / so verelye shulde the deth of his bodie and frut¦te of his passiō be distributed to all faithfull fol¦ke. In that the bred strengtheneth oure bodies yt is his owin bodye / signiyfing that as owre bodies are strengthened ād cōforted by bred / so are owre sowles by the faith in his bodie brekīg And likewise of the wyne in that yt was so di∣stribted and so cōforteth vs and maketh vs me¦rye. Furthermore the bred and wine haue a no∣ther propertie / for the wc yt is called our bodie. For in that the bred is made one brede of manie graynes or cornes / yt is o{ur} bodie signifieng that
we though we be manie / are made one brede that is to saye one bodie. And in that the wine is ma¦de one wyne of manye grapes / yt is our bodye signifieng that though we are manie yet in chri¦ste and thorough Christe we are made one bodie and membres to eche other. But in this thinge Paulle and Christe agre. For as Paule calleth the brede oure bodye and vs the brd because of this propertie that yt is made one of manie euin so doth Christe call yt his bodye because of the {pro}pertyes before rehersed. Furthermore in this they agre / that as Paulles wordes / muste be ta∣ken spūallye (for I thinke there is no man so mad / as to Iudge that the bred is our bodye in dede although in that pro{per}tie yt rep̄senteth our bodie). Euyn so muste Christes wordes be vn∣derstond spirituallye that in thosse properties yt representeth his verye bodie. Now when we come to gether to receyue this brede then by the receyuing of yt in the congregacion / we do openlye testifie that we all (wc receyue yt) are o¦ne bodye / {pro}fessing one god / one faith & one bap¦tyme / and that the bodie of Christe was broken and his bloude shed for remission of oure sinnes Now sith we so do / we maye not a cōpanye nor sit in the congregacion or fellowship of thē that offer vnto ydolles and eate before them. For as Paule sayeth / ye can not drinke the cupe of the lorde and the cupe of the deuells:Paule. ye can not be partakers of the table of the lorde and of the ta¦ble of the deuylles. I wold not that you shuld haue felowship wt deuelles. The hethen whiche offerred vnto Idolles were the fellowship of de¦uellis
/ not because they eate the deuelles bodye or drāke the deueles bloude / but because they be¦leued & put their confydens in the ydole or de∣uill as ī their god and all that were of that faith hade their ceremonies / & gaue hart ye thākes to their god wt that feaste wc they kept. They came to one place & brougt their meate before the I¦dole & offered yt. And wt their offering gaue vn¦to the deuill godlye honour. And then they sate downe and eate the offeryng to gether geuyng prayse and thankes vnto their God / and were one bodye and one fellowship of the deuell why¦che they testiffye by eating of that offeringe be¦fore that idolle. Now dothe s, Paule reprehend the Corinthiās for berynge the gyntiles cōpa∣nie in eatinge before the idolle. For they knowe that the meate was like other meate. And therfo¦re though them sellues fre to eate yt or leue yt. But they {per}ceyued not that that congregacyon was the fellowship of deuelles wc were there ga¦thered (not for the meate sake) but for to thāke and prayse the ydolle their God in whom they had their confidence. And all that there assem∣bled ād did there eate / & did openly testifye / that they all were one bodie / professynge one faith in theyr god that ydolle, So pauie rebuked them / for because that b their eating (in that place ād fellowship) they testified openlye / that they we∣re of the deuelys bodye & reioysed in the ydolle their god in whom they had fayth and cōfidence And therfore sayth paule / that they can not both drinke the cupe of the lorde testifynge hym to be their God in whom onlye they haue truste and
iaūce / and the cupe of the deuell testifyinge the Idolle to be their god and refuge. Here you maye note that the meate & the eatin¦ge of yt in this place & fellowship is more then the comō meate & eating in othr places. For el they might lawfullye haue dronken the deuel∣les cup wyth them the one daye / and the cup of the lorde the next daye wt hys disciples. What was yt more verelye yt was meate wc by the ea∣tinge of yt in that place and fellowship / did te∣stifie openlye vnto all mē / that he was ther god whose cup they dranke / and before whom they eate in that fellowshyp: and so in their eatynge they praysed and honored the idole, And therfo¦re they that had their truse in the leuinge god and in the bloude of hys sonne Christ / myght not eate with them. And likewise yt ys in the sarament / the brede and the eatinge of yt in the place and fellowship where yt ys eceyued / ys more then comen bred. What ys yt more? Ue∣relye yt ys brede which by the eatinge of yt in that place and fellowship / doth testyye openlye vnto all men / that he ys oure verye God who∣se cup we drinke & before whom we eate in that fellowship / and that we put all our fyaunce in hym & in the bloude of hys sonne Christe Iesu / geuinge god all honoure & infinite thankes for his great loue wher wt he loued vs / as ys yt te∣stifyed / in the bloude of his sonne / wc was shed for oure synnes. So that in this place and fel∣lowship maye no man eate nor drynke with vs / but he that is of our fayth & knowelegeth thesa¦me god that we doo. As by example / yf mā were
well beloued emonge his neyghboures (albe yt he haue some ennemyes) and were longe absnt from his frendes in a strange contrye: when he were come home / his neighboures that loued hī wolde greatlye reioyse & {per}aduenture wolde bi a copō or a nother pece of meate to geue him his welcō home / & get thē to some honest mās howse or to a tauerne / and make good chere to gether / to testifie openlye that he is welcome home / and that they all whiche are at that bāket reioyse of his cominge home. Nowe I saye / that this ban¦ket is more then another meale / for at this ban∣ket his enemyes maye be loth to come / because they can not reioyse at his cominge home / & ther¦fore can not make good chere amōge them / testi¦fying that he is welcome home: but reather ab∣horreth the meate and drinke that is there eaten because their hart doth not fauoure the parson for whose sake yt is prepared. Natwtstondinge yf a capons legge were reserued for one of hys ennemyes and afterward geuyn hym whan the banket were don / he might lawfullye eate yt. For then yt were but bare meate suche as he ea¦tyeh home. And likewise the ennemyes of chri¦ste which beleue not that they haue remissyon of sinnes thorough his bloude sheding / can not reioise of his bodye breaking. And therfore can not make good chere amonge them / but yf any be reserued after the maundye / he maye lawfullye eate yt for yt is but bred. And his loueres that are ther present do rather come thider to geue hī his welcome home then for the meate / and they more eate his welcome home then the meate.
But yf any of his enemyes fortune to be there / they eate onlye the meate / ād not his welcom ho¦me. For they reioyse not at his cōmynge home. Lykewise the faithfull that are there present / doo rather come thether to reioyse in the fayth of his bodye breakyng / then in breakinge or ea¦tinge of the bred or meate. But yf any of the vn¦faythfull fortune to be there they eate only the brede / and not his bodie breakyng. For they re¦ioyse not at his bodie breakinge. Here {per}aduen∣ture some wold suppose that I were contrarye to my sellfe. For before I sayd / that yt was mo∣re then meate that was aten at the gētiles fea¦ste / & more then meate that was eatē at my neigh¦boures welcome home / & more then bred that ys eaten at the receyuing of the sacramēt of the bo¦die & bloude of christe. And nowe I saye / that yf a mās enemie be there / he eateth onlye the meate and not the welcom home. And lykewise the vn¦faythfull eateth onlye brede and not the bodye and bloude of Christe. How maye these wordes stonde to gether? I answer / that they eate but on¦lye bred or meate that profyteth them / but in de¦de they eate more to theyr hynderaunce / and e∣uyn there owyn dampnacyon. For they that did eate in the fellowship of gentiles / dit but on¦lye eate the meate to there profyte / but in eatyn¦ge theyr meate their facte dyd openly testyfye that they honoured that Idolle for ther GOD (althought their herte were other wise) wher∣in they comitted Idolatrye.1. Cor.  And besydes that they wounded the coscyences of their weake brethern and so synned agaynst God. Besydes
that / he that enuieth hys neighboure & comyth to that banket / ateth but onlye the meate that profiteth him: natwtstonding in his owē harte / he eateth the rancor ād malice of his mynde / to his greate greuaunce / whē he seeth them so re∣ioyse. And of his owē cōpanyōs wc are also the¦se mannes enemyes / he doth purchase himsellfe hatred / because wt his facte he testyfith that he loueth him / although his harte be wotherwise / & of god shalbe condēpned. For he that hatth his brother / ys a murtherer. Furthemore he that ys vnfaythfull and comyth to the manu∣die 1. Ioan. 3/ eateth but onlie the bred that {pro}fiteth him / notwtstondyng he eateth beside that hys owyn dampnacyon / because he beleueth not that the bodie of our sauyour wc the sacrament represen¦teth / is broken for his synnes / and his bloude¦shed / to washe thē awaye. This I am compel∣led to do / to stope the chatringe mouthes of so¦phisters / albe yt to thē that he sober / yt had byn ynough to haue said / they eate onlie bred / & not the bodie breaking &c. For they ryght well vnd¦stōd yt by the cōrarye antithesie / & knowe that I mēt not by that (onlye) that he shuld eate th brede and nothinge els but onlye bred: but that I mēt by this worde (onlye) that he shulde eate the brede with oute the bodye / And so lykewy∣se in other exāples. Thus haue we suffecientlie declared paules mynd in the .10. Chapter. In the .xi. chapter paule maketh moche mēciō of the maūdi & discribeth yt to the vttermoste.1. Cor. 11. First (he saith) whē ye come to gether ī one pla¦ce / a man cā not eate the lordes sou{per}. For euery
mā begynnyth afore to eate his owyn sou{per} / ād one is hoūgrye & an other ys dronkē. Haue ye not howses to eate & drīke in? or els dispice ye the cōgrigaciō of god & shame thē that haue not what shall I saye vnto you? shall I prayse you? In this I prayse you not. Paule did instructe accordinge to christes mynde / that the Coryn∣thians shuld come to gether to eate the lordes sou{per} Whiche lyeth not so moche in the carnall eatynge as in the spirituall: and is greatly dys¦syred to be atē / not by the hoūger of the bodie / but by the hounger of the faythful harte. wc ys gredye to publyshe the prayse of the lorde & ge¦ue him hartie thākes / & moue other to the same that of many / praise might be geuin vnto o{ur} mo¦ste mercifull father for the loue wc he shewed vs in the bloude of his owī moste deare sonne christ iesu. Wherwt we are washed frō o{ur} sinnes & suer¦lie sealed vnto euerlastīge liffe. wt suche hoūger did christe eate the paschal lāde / sayinge to his di¦ciples: I haue inwardlye dessired to eate this es¦ter lambe wt you before that I suffer.Luc. 2. Christes inwarde desyre was not to fyll his bellye wt his disciples / but he had a spūall honger: bothe to praise his father wt thē / for their bodelie deliuerā¦ce oute of the lande of egypt: & speciallye to alter the paschal lābe & memorie of the carnall deliue¦rāce / in to a maūdie of myrth & thā geuing for o{ur} spūall deliuerāce oute of the bōdage of synn In so moche that whē christ knewe that yt was his fathers will & pleasure / that he shuld suffer for o{ur} innes (wherin his hono{ur} / glorie & prayse shulde be published) then was yt a pleasure vnto hī / to declare
vnto his disciples that great benefite / vnto hi fathers prayse and glorie: and so did institute that we shuld come to gether ād breake the bre¦de in the remēbraūce of his bodye breakynge & bloudeshedīge: & that we shuld eate it to gether reioysinge wt eche other & declarīge his bn̄fites Now were the corinthians fallin frō this hoū¦ger / and cā not to gether to thentēt that goddes prayse shuld be published by thē in the myddes of the congrygacion / but cā to fede their fleshe & to make carnall chere. In so moche that the ry∣che wolde haue meate and drincke ynough / ād take suche aboundaūce that they wolde be drō¦ke (and so made yt ther owyn souper & not the lordes / as paule sayth / ād did eate onlye the bre¦de and meate / ād not the bodye breakynge as I sayd before) and the poore which hade not (that is to saye that had no meate to eate) where sha∣med & hongrye / ād so could not reiose ād pray¦se the lorde: by the reason that the delicate fare of the riche was an occasion for the pore eo la∣mēt their pourtye ād thus the riche did nether prayse god thēselues / nor suffered the poore to doo yt / but were an occasiō to hynder them. They shulde haue brought their meate & drin¦ke ād haue deuided yt wt their poore brothern / that they might haue byn mery to gether / ād so to haue geuyn thē occasion to be merye ād reioy¦se in the lorde wt thākes geuinge. But they had nether luste to prayse god nor to cōforte their neighboure. Ther fayth was feble ād their cha¦rite cold / and had no regard but to fyll their bo¦dye & fede there fleshe: And so dispised the poore
congrygacion of god whom they shuld haue ho∣noured for the spyrite that was in thē & fauour that god had shewed indifferentlye vnto them in the bloude of his sonne christe. When Paul perceyued that they were thus fleshlie minded & had no mynde vnto that spūall maundye which chefelye shuld ther be aduertised / he reproueth thē sore / rehersinge the wordes of christe That wc I gaue vnto you I receyued of the lorde. For the lorde Iesus the same night in the wc he was betrayed / toke bred & thāked and brake yt & sayd: take ye and eate ye / this ys my bodie wc ys brokē for you / this do ye in the remēbraūce of me. After the same maner he toke the cup whē souper was don sayinge / this cup is the new te¦stamēt in my bloude / this do ye as ofte as ye drin¦ke yt in the remembraunce of me. For as ofte as ye shall eate thys bred and drynke this cup / ye shall shewe the lordes deth / tyll he come. As though he shuld saye / ye corinthians are moche to blame wc at this souper seke the foede of yo{ur} fleshe. For yt was institute of christe / not for the entēt to noryshe the belye / but to strēghthē the harte & soule in god. And bi this you maye kno¦we that christe so mēt. For he callyth yt his bo∣dye wc is geuin for you / so that the name yt sellf might testifie vnto yow / that in this sou{per} you shuld more eate hys bodye wc is geuyn for you (by digestyng that in to the bowelles of yo{ur} sou¦le) thē the breed wc by the breakīge / & the distri¦butyng of yt / doth rep̄sent his bodie breakīge & the distributyng theroff vnto all that are fayth¦full. And that he so meaneth ys euydent by the
wordes following / wc saye / this do in the remem¦braunce of me: and likewise of the cup. And fi∣nallie oncluding of both / Paule sayth / as often as ye shall eate this brede ād drinke this cup (in this place and fellowship) ye shall shewe the lor¦des deth vntill he come / praisinge the lorde for the dethe of his sonne and exortinge other to do the same / reioysinge in him wt infinite thankes And thefore ye are to blame wc seke onlye to fede the bellye wt that thinge wc was onlye institute to fede the soule. And ther vppon yt followyth. Wherfore who so euer doth eate of this bred or drīke of this cup vnworthelie / is giltye of the bo¦dye & bloude of the lorde. He eateth this brede vnworthelie / wc regardeth not the purpose for the wc Christ did insitute yt. wc comith not to it wt spūall honger / to eate thorough faith his ve¦rye bodye / wc the bred representeth by the brea∣king ād distributinge o yt: whiche comith not wt a merye harte geuinge God hartye thankes for their deliuerance from synne: Whiche do not moche more eate in their harte the deth of his bo¦dye / then they do the bred wt their mouth. Now sith the Corinthians dyd onlye seke their bely and fleshe / & forgat goddes honour and prayse (for which t was institute / that thankes shuld be geuyn by the remembraunce o his bodie bre¦akinge for vs) they eate yt to goddes dishono{ur} & to their neighboures hinderrance / and to ther owin condempnacion / and so for lacke of fayth were gltye of Christes bodie wc (by faith) they shulde there cheffelye haue eatn to ther soules helth. And therfore yt followith.
¶Lett a man therfore examyne hym sellfe / and so let hym eate of the brede / and drinke of the cup. THis prouynge or examinynge of a mans sel¦fe is fyrste to thinke wt him sellfe wt what luste and disyre he comyth vnto the maundye & wyll eate that bed: whether he besure that he is the childe of god & in the fayth of Christe: And whether hs conscence do beare hym wytnes that Christes bodye was brokyn for hym: And whether the luste that he hath to prayse god ād thanke hym wt a faythfull harte in the myddes of the brethern / do dryue hym thither warde. Or els whether he do yt for the meates sake or to kepe the custome: for then were yt better that he were awye. For he that eateth or drinketh vnworthelye / eateth ād drinkethe his owyn dā¦nacyon / because he maketh no difference of the lordes bodye. That ys / as yt ys sayd before / he that regardeth not the purpose for which it was institute / ād puteth no defference betwene this eatng and othr eating (for other eatynge doth onlye serue the bellye) but thys eatynge was institute and ordeyned / to sarue the soule and inwarde man. And therfore he that abuseth yt to the fleshe / eateth and drinketh hys owyn dampnacyon, And he comyth vnworthelye to the maundye where the sacrament of Christes bodye ys eaten: ye / where the bodye of the lor∣de ys eaten / not arnallye wt the teth and bllye but spiritually wt the harte and faythe. Uppon this followeth the text that master More alle∣geth and wresteth for his purpose.
For this cause manye are weake and sike amō¦ge you / & manie slepe. Yf we had trulie Iudged oure selues / we shuld not haue byn Iudged Whē we are Iudged of the lorde / we are chastened because we shuld not be dampned wt the worlde Wherfore my brethern / when ye come to gether to eate / tarye one for another. Yf any man hun∣ger / lett him eate at home / that ye come not to ge¦ther vnto condempnacyon. For this cause (that is) for lacke of good exa∣mininge of oure selues (as ys before touched) manie are weake and syke in the fayth / & manye slepe / and haue loste their fayth in Christes blou¦de / for lacke of remembraunce of his bodye brea¦king and bloude shedinge: ye and not that onlie but manye were weake and sike euyn striken wt bodelye diseases for abusinge the sacrament of his bodye / eatinge the bred wt their teth ād not his bodye wt their hart and mynde and {per}aduen¦ture some slayne for yt / by the srocke of god. wc yf they had truly Iudged and examined thē sel¦ues for what intent they cam thither and why yt was institute / shuld not haue byn so Iudged and chastened of the lorde.

For we though we be manye / are yet one bodye and one bred / as mannye as are partakers of one bred.1. Cor.  And agayne he saeth / as oftē as ye ea¦te of this bred or drīke of this cuppe / you shall shewe the lordes deth vnyll he come. Also luke callethe yt bred saying in the ActesActes.  they conti∣nued in the fellowship of the aposteles / & in the breakinge of the brede and prayer.Mat. 2 Mar. 1 Luc. 22. Also Christe called the cuppe the frute of a vyne / saying I shall not from hence forward drinke of the frute of the vine vntill I drinke that newe in the ki¦dom of my father. Furthermore nature doth teache you that both the bred and wine contine in their nature. For the bred muldeth yf yt be kept longe / ye & wor∣mis bred in yt. And ye poore mouse will runne a¦waye wt yt and eate yt / wc are euidence ynough that there remaynith bred. Also the wine yf yt were reserued / wold wax sower / as they confesse them selues And therfore they howsell the laye people / but wt one kinde onlye: because the wine can not cōtinue nor be rerued to haue readye
at hande / when nede were. And surelye as y there remayned no bred / yt could not mould nor wax full of wormes / euyn so yf there remayned no wine / yt could nt wax sower. And therfore yt is but faulse doctrine tha our p̄lates so long haue taught & published. Finallie that ther remaineth bred / might be {pro}¦uyd by the auctorite of manie doctoures wt calle yt bred & wine / euyn as Christe & his appostelis ded And though some sophisters wolde wreste their sayinge / and expoūd thē after their owyn hantase / yet shall I allege thē one doctoure wc was pope / that maketh so plaine wt vs that they shall neuer be able to auoyde hym. Gelasiu{us} in conci∣io Ro.For pope Gelasius writeth on this maner. Cer¦te sacramēta q sumimus corporis & sanguinis Chri¦sti diuinae res sunt, propter qd & per eadē diuinae efficimur cōsortes naturae. Et tamē nō deinit esse substātia uel natura panis et uini, sed {per}manet in suae {pro}prietate naturae. Et certe imago et similitudo cor¦poris & sanguinis Christi in actiōe misteriorū cele¦brantur. That is to saie / surelye the sacramēt of the bdye & bloude of Christe wt we receyue / are a godlye thynge / & therfore thorough thm are we made {per}takers of the godly nature. And yet doth yt not cease to be the substāce or nature of bred and wine / but they continue in the proper¦tie of their owyn nature. And surely the image and similitude of the bodye and bloude are cele∣brated in the acte of the misterys This I am su¦re / that no mā can auoyd yt / nor so wrest yt / but that all men shall sone espye hys folye / and ther¦fore I maye conclude that there remayneth the
substance and nature of brede & wine. The seconde poynte wherin Frith dissen¦teth from oure prelates and their proctoure. THe prelates beleue that his verie fleshe is p̄sent to the teth of thē that eate the sacra∣ment / and that the wicked eate his verye bodye Frith sayth that yt is none article of our Crede and therfore he rekenith that he is in no Ieoper¦dye though he beleue yt not. And he thinketh that his fleshe is not p̄sent vnto the teth of thē that receyue the sacrament. For hys fleshe ys onlye in one place at once. And that he proueh both by the auctorite of Sainct Austen ad Dar∣danum / and also by the auctorite of Fulgentius ad Thrasuuādum libro 20. as before apereth in the boke. And Fryth sayth that the wicked ea∣te not hys verye fleshe allthough they receue the sacrament. And that he proueth by the scri∣pture / doctoures and good reason grounded vp¦pon the scryptures. The scripture is this / he that eateth christesIoan. 6 bodie hath euerlastīge liffe / but the wicked hath not euerlastinge liffe / ergo then the wicked eate not his bodye. Agayne the scrypture sayeth he that eateth christes fleshe & drinketh his bloude abydeth in christe & christe in hī but the wicked abyde not in christe nor christe ī hī / ergo the wic¦ked eate not his fleshe nor drinke his bloude. This maye also be confyrmed by good aucto∣rite.August in ser. d sacra fe pasche. For sainct Austen sayeth he that abdeth not in christe & in whō christe abydeth not / wt ou¦e doubte he eateth not his fleshe nor drīketh his
bloude / allthough he eate & drinke the sacramēt of so great a thinge vnto his ampnacion. BedaAnd euen the same wordes hathe beda vppon the tenth chapter of the fyrste pistle to the Co∣rinthians. Augusti. de ciuita¦te Dei in libro. 21. cap. 25.Agayne. s. Austene sayeth / he that abideth not in me & in whom I abyde not / let him not saye nor thinke / that he eateth my bodye or drinketh my bloude. And euen the same wordes hath Be¦da vppon the sixt chapter of the firste epistle to the Corinthiās. And euen the same sentēce hath Ambrose / and Prosper / ād Beda vppon the .xi chapter of the firste pistle to the Corinthians. Finallye this maye be proued by good reason grounded vppon the scripture. Christ wold not suffer marye (though she loued him well) to tou¦che him / because she lacked one poynt of faythe / and did not beleue that he was equale wt his fa¦ther. And therfore be reason yt muste followe / that he wil not suffer the wicked (wc nether ha∣ue good faith nor loue towardes hī) both to tou¦che him and eate him in to their vnclene bodies Now sith this is proued true that the wicked eate not his bodie / yt must also therof nedes fol¦lowe / that the sacramēt is not his naturall bodie For they do eate the sacramēt as all men knowe Besides that the faithfull do not eate christes bodye wt their teth. And therfore yt muste follo¦we that the wicked do not eate yt wt ther teth. The antecedēt or first {per}te of the reason is {pro}ued by the wordes of christe wc saith that the fleshe {pro}¦fiteth nothinge at all / meaning that yt doth not {pro}fite as they vnderstode him:Ioan. 6 that is to saie / yt
profiteth nothinge to be eaten carnallie wt their teth & bellye / as they vnderstode him. For els yt profyteth moche to be eatē spūallye / that ys to saye / to beleue that thorough his bodye breakin¦ge and bloud shedinge oure sinnes are purged. And thus doth Origene / s. Ausen / Beda / Chri∣sostome / and Athanasius expoūd yt / as apereth in the boke before. And therfore Frith saith that onlie faithfull mē eate his bodie: not wt ther teth and mouth / but wt their faieth ād harte / y• digest yt in to the bowelles of their soulles thorough beleuing that yt was brokē on the crosse / to wa¦she awaye their synnes. And the wicked eate not his bodye but onye the bred and there dāp¦nacyon / because they eate him not spūallie: that is / because they beleue not in his bodie breakin¦ge and bloude shedinge. ¶The third poynt wherin Frith dissenteth from your prelates and their proctoure. THe p̄lates beleue that men oughte to wors¦hip the sacrament but Frith saith naye / ād affyrmith that yt is Idolatrye to worship yt And he sayth that Christ and hys appostyllis taught vs not so to do: nether did the holy fa∣thers so teache vs. And Frith saith that the auctoures of this worshipinge are the childer∣ne of {per}dicion wc haue ouerwhelmed this worlde wt synne. Neuerthelesse we muste receyue yt re∣uerentlye because of the doctrine that yt bryn∣gith vs. For it preacheth christes deth vnto vs / & discribeth yt before oure eyen / euen as a faith¦full p̄char by the worde doth in still yt in to vs by our eares ād hearing. And that yt supplieth
the Roume of a prchar is euident by the wor∣des of s. Ausen wc sayeth. Paulus quis portaret sarcinā corporis quod aggrauat animā, potuit ta∣men significando predicare Dominū esum Chri∣stum, aliter perlinguā suam, aliter per epistolam, aliter per sacramentū corporis Christi, That is to saye / though Paule did ere the burthen of the bodye wc doth honorate the soule / yet was he ab¦le in sygifying to preache the lorde Iesus chri¦ste / one waye by his tonge / and a nother waie bi a pistle / and a nother waye by the sacrament of Christes bodye. &c. For as the people by vnder¦stonding the sygnifycacion of the wordes wc he spake did heare the glorious gospell of god / ād as by the readynge of his pistle they vndersod his mnde and receyued the worde of the soules helth / so by the ministrayon of the sacrament they might see wt ther eyen the thīge wc they har¦de & reade & so haue their sences occupied about the misserye / that they might the more ernestlie prynt it in their minde. As by exāple: The pro¦phet Hieremie beinge in Hierusalem in the ty∣me of edchias kynge of the Iewes / prophe∣syed see. 27& p̄ached vnto thē / that they shuld be takē p̄soners of Nabugo donear the kynge of Baby¦lon, And the Iewes were angrye wt him & wold not beleue his wordes. And therfore he made a chaine or etters of wode & put thē a bout his nc¦ke & {pro}phsid agayne & preached that they shuld be taken p̄soners & lde captiue in to Babylon. And as his wordes did certifye their ares that they shuld be subdued / so the chayne did p̄sent their captiuite euen before their eyen. wc thinge
did more vehemētlye worke in thē th th are wordes could doo / & euen so yt is in the sacramēt For likewise as the wordes di in still yt in to o{ur} eares / that his bodie was geuin for vs / & his bloude shed for the remission of o{ur} sinnes / euē s did the ministratiō of the sacramēt expresse the same thinge vnto o{ur} sight / & do the more effectu¦ouslye moue vs / then the bare wordes might do and make vs more attent vnto the thinge / that we maye wholye geue thākes vnto god & pray¦se hym for his bountuous benefites. And therfo¦re seynge yt is as a p̄char / expressinge vnto our sight the same thinge that the wordes doo to ou¦re ares / you muste receyue yt wt reuerēs & sober behavyoure / aduertisinge the thing / that yt rep̄¦senteth vnto you. And euē the same honoure is dewe vnto yt wc is geuin vnto the scripture that is the worde of god. For vnto that muste a mā deuoutlie geue eare / & ruerentlie take the boke in his hāde: ye & yf he kisse the boke for the docr¦nes sake that he lerneth there oute / he is to be c̄¦mēded, Neuerthelesse yf he shuld goo sence his boke / men might well thinke that he were verie childyshe. But yf he shuld knele downe & praie to his boke then he did cōmitte playne idolatrie Consider deare brethern what I saie & auoy∣de this Ieo{per}die. wc thinge auoyded / I care not as touchinge the presence of his bodye / though you beleue that his naturall fleshe be there in de¦de (& not onlye in a misterye as I haue taught) For whē the Ieoperdye is paste / he were a fole that wolde be contentyous for a thinge as lon∣ge as there comyth no urte therbye.
The germanes wc beleue the presence of his bo¦dye / do not worship yt / but playnly teache the contrarye and in that poynt (thankes be to god) all they whom you call herytickes / do agre full-well. Onlye auoyde thys Idolatrye and I de∣syre no more. ¶The conclusion of this treatise. NOwe deare brethern I beseche you for the mercye that ye loke fore in Christ Iesu / that you accept thys worke wt a syngle eye and no contentyons harte For necessite hath cōpelled me to wryte yt / because I was in¦formed both of my lorde of win¦chester and other creadyble persons / that I had by the meanes of my fyrst treatise offended many men. Which thinge maye well be true: For yt was to slender to enstructe all thē wc haue sins sene yt / alb yt yt were suffecyent for their vse to whom yt was fyrst deliuered, And therfore I thought yt not onlye expedient but also necessa¦rie / to enstructe them further in the truth / that they might se plaine euidēce of that thing wher in they were offended. By this wearke you shall espye their blasphe¦mies & the venemous tonges wher wt they sla¦under not onlye them that publyshe the truthe / but euyn the truth yt seelfe. They shame not to saye / that we affyrme yt to be onlye bred and no¦thinge els. And we saye not so: but we saye that besyde the substance of bred / yt is the sacrament of Christes bodye and bloud. As the yuye han∣gyng
before the tauerne doore ys more then ba∣re yuye. For beside the substance of yuye / yt ys a signe / and signifyeth that there is wyne to be sould. And this sacrament signifyeth vnto vs and poynteth oute before oure eyes that as ve∣rely as that bred is broken / so verely was chri∣stes bodye broken for our synnes: And as that bred is distributed vnto vs / so is hys bodie and fructe of hys passyon distributed vnto all hys faythfull. And as the bred comforteth the bodie so doth the fayth in Christes deth cōforte oure soules. And as surelye as we haue that bred and eate yt wyth oure mouth and teth / and knowe by our senses that we haue yt wt in vs / and are partakers therof: no more nede we to doubte of hys bodye and bloud / but that thorough fayth / we are as sure of thē / as we are sure of that bred As yt is sufficientlye declared in my boke. Agayne you maye perceyue how wyckydlye they report on vs wc affyrme that we dishonou∣re yt wc geue yt the right honoure that yt ought to haue. And you do playnlye dishonoure yt / wc geue vnto yt the honoure that is onlye dew vn¦to god. We geue yt the same honoure that we ge¦ue vnto the holye scripture & worde of god / be∣cause yt expresseth vnto our senses the deth of our sauyoure / and doth more dypelye prent yt wt in vs. And therfore we calle yt an holye sacra¦ment / as we calle goddes worde / holye scriptu∣re. And we receyue this sacrament wt great re∣uerence / euyn as we reuerrentlye reade or hea∣re preached the holye worde of God wc contey∣neth the helth of o{ur} soules. And we graunt that
hys bodye ys present with the bred as yt ys wt th word / and with both yt ys verelye receyued and eaten thorough fayth. But yf we shuld kne¦le downe and praye vnto the holye scrypture / men might count vs soles / and might lawfullye saye / that we do not honoure the sripture by that meanes / but rather dishonoure yt. For the right honoure of a thinge ys / to vse yt or that entent that yt was institute of god. And he hat abuseth yt to any other purpose / doth in dede dis¦honoure yt. And lykewise yt is in the sacamēt wc was institute to kepe in memorye he dth of christ / wc f we do any other wise honoure / then we do the holye scripture (vnto the wc we maye in no wise make our prayers) I saye that then we shulde vterie dishonoure yt. Auoyde ther¦fore this poynt of Idolatrye / and all ys saffe. Finallye we saye that they speak well and faythfullye wc saye that they goo o the bodie & receue the bodye of Christ / and that they spea∣ke vilynously & wickedlye wc saye that tey on¦lye receyue bred or the signe of his bodye for in so sayinge they declare theyr inside lye. For the faythfull wyll reakyn that he is euyll repor¦ted of and reputed or a traytoure and a nother Iudas / yf me shuld saye of hym that he did on¦lye receyue the sacramēt / and not also the thyn¦ge which the sacramēt doth signifye. For albe it he onlie eateh the bred & sacramēt wt his mouth and teth: yet wt his harte and fayth iwardlye / he eatethe the very thinge yt sellfe wt the sacra∣ment owtwardlye dothe represent And of this springe the maner of speakinges
that the old fathers do somtyme vse / wc at the irst sight mought seame cōtrarie to o{ur} sentense But yf they be will pōdered / yt mae sone be se¦n / ow they shuld be taken. For many tymes when they speake of the sacrament & outward eatyng / they applye vnto the sacrament & owt∣ward eatinge / the frute and cōditions of the in¦warde eatinge and thinge yt sllfe  because that in a aythfull man they are so Ioyntye Ioy∣ned that the one is neuer wt oute the other. As by xāple / Marye is named the mother of god and yet she is not the mother of hys godhed by the wc parte onlye he is called god / but because she is hys mother / as touchinge his manhode / and the godhed is so annexed wt the māed that they both / make but one person / therfore ys she called the mother of god / wc in dede yf y b wy∣selye weyed / shabe founde to be bused speache And yet neuerthelesse yt may very will be vsyd yf men vnderstond what ys ment therbye / but yf thorough the vse of thys speache / men shuld fal in to suche an erroure that wold affyrme ou¦re ladye to be in dede the mother of hys god∣hed / then necessyte shuld compell vs to make a dystynctyon betwne the nature of hys god∣hed and the nature of hys manhod / and so to expound the mater vnto them / and bringe them home agayne in to the ryght vnderstondynge. As we are now consrayned to do in thys sa∣crament / because you misconstrue the sayin∣ges of the scrypture and Doctoures. Whych notwythsondyng (yf a man vnderond them) saye verye well.
And many suche maner of speaches are conta¦ned in the scripture: As where christ saeth Io¦an. 3. there shall no man ascend in to heuin / but he that discēdeth frō heuē / the sone of mā wc ys in heuin. Thys text doth saye tha the sonne of mā was thē in heuē / whē he pake thes words vnto ncodemus here o yerh wc thinge all wi¦se mē cōsent to be vnderstond / propter unitatem personae: That is to saye / for the vnite of the per¦son. For albe it his godhed was in euerie place at that tyme / yet was not his māhod (by the wc he was called the sonne of man) in heuin at that tyme. And yet christ sayd that yt was in heuen for the vnite of his {per}son, For his godhed was in heuen ād because the godhed ād manhode ma¦de one {per}son / therfore yt was ascrybed vnto the August.manhod wt was onye vereied vppon the god¦hed / as saint Auten ad Dardanum doth dely∣gentlye declare. And lyke wise in the sacramēt o baptime / be¦cause the inward workinge of the holye gos is euer ānexed in the faythfull / vnto the outward ceremonye: therfore somtyme the frute of the in¦ward baptyme ys ascrybed onto the outward warke. And so the scripture vseth to speake of the outward baptme as though yt were the in¦ward: that is to saye / the spryt of god. And ther¦fore s. Paule sayeth that we are buried wt chri∣ste thorough baptime. And yet as s. Austene ex¦poundeth yt / the outeward baptime dothe but signifie this buriall.Augusti¦nus ad bo¦nifacium And agayne paule sayeth / as manye as are baptised haue put christ vppō thē. And yet in dede oure outeward baptyme
doth but signifie / that we haue put christe vp∣pon vs. But by the inward baptime (which is the water of liffe and spirite of god) we haue in dede put him vppon vs and lyue in hym and he in vs. Whiche notwithstondynge ys verye fal¦se for all the outeward baptyme / in them that receyue yt not in fayth. And vnto them yt is but abare sygne / Wherof they get no profyte / but dampnacyon. And here you maye euydentlye {per}ceyue howe yt ys some tyme in scripture ascrybed vnto the outeward worke & ceremonye / wc ys onlye true in the inward veryte. And this place shall ex∣pound all the old doctoures whiche seame con∣trarye to our sentense, And therfore Marke yt well. Thus haue you my mynde further vppō the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christe. Wherin yf you reaken that I haue byn to lon∣ge in repeting one thinge so often / I shall praie you of pardon. But surelie me thought I cold not be shorter. For the worlde is suche now a dayes that some wolde heare and can not: and so¦me do heare and will not. And therfore I am cōpelled so often to repete that thinge whi¦che a wise man wolde vnderstond with halue the wordes. ¶Praye Christen reader that the wor¦de of GOD maye encrease & that God maye be glorifyed thorough my bondes AMEN.
¶The articles wherfore Iohan Frith died which he wrote in newgate the .23. aye of Iune / the ye¦re of oure Lorde 1533. I Doute not deare brethern / but that yt dothe / some deale vexe you / to see the one parte haue all the wordes / and fraly to speake hat they lyste / ād the other to be put to syence / and not to be hard indifferently. But referre youre maters to god / whiche shortly shall Iudge after a nother fasyon. But in the mane ceason / I shall reher∣se vnto you the articles for whyche I am con∣dempned. ¶ They examined me but of two arti∣cles whyche are these. Fyrste whyther I thoughte / there were no purgatory to purg the sowle after this present lyfe.Articl And I sayd / that I thoughte there was none. For man ys made but of two partes / the body and the sowle. And the body ys purged by the crosse of Christe / whyche he layeth apon ue¦ry chylde that he receauyth: as affliction / world¦ly opressyon / persecucion / emprisonment & cet. and dethe finishith synne. And the sowle is pur¦ged by the worde of god / whiche we receaue tho¦row faythe / vnto the healthe and salluacyon bo¦the of body & sowle. Now & yf I dyd knowe any thirde {per}te wherof we are made / I wolde also gladly graūt them 3. pur¦gatory but seyng / I knowe none suche / I must
denye the popes purgatory. Neuertheles I co¦unte nether parte a necessary article of our fay∣the / necessarely to be beleauyd vnder payne of dampnacyon / whyther ther be suche a purgato∣ry or not. article.The secode article was thys / whyther that I thoughte / that the sacramēt of the aulter was the body of Christe. And I sayd ye / that I tho∣ughte that yt was bothe christes body / and also our body / as s. Paulle saythe. 1. Cor. 10. cha. In that yt ys made one brede of many gray∣nes yt is our body sygnifying that we though we be many / are yet one body: and lyke wyse of the wyne in that yt is made one wyne / of ma∣ny grapes. And agayne in that yt is broken / yt is Chr¦stes body / signyfyeng that hys body shulde be broken / that is to say suffer dethe / to redeme vs from our inquites, In that yt was distributed / yt was christes body / sygnfyeng that as verely / as that sacra∣ment is distributyd vnto vs / so verely ys Chri¦stes body / and the frute of hys passyon distribu¦ted vnto all faythfull men. In that yt ys receauyd / yt is Christes body sygnifying that as verely / as te outwarde mā receauyth the sacrament with his tethe / & mou∣the / so verely dothe the inward mā / thorow fay¦the / receaue Christes body & frute of his passy¦on / and ys as sure of yt / as of the brede that he eayth. Another question.Well sayd they / do you not thincke / that hys very naturall body / bothe flesshe and bloude ys
really contayned vnder the sacrament / and the∣re actually present / besyde all similitudes. No sayd I / I do not so thincke.¶An an¦swere. Notwtstonding I wolde not that any shulde counte that I make my saynge (whiche is the negatiue) any artycle of the faythe. For euen as I saye that you ough¦te not to make any necessary article of y• faythe of youre parte (whiche is the affyrmatiue). So I saye agayne / that we make none necessary ar¦ticle of the faithe of owre parte / but leue yt in∣different for all men to Iudge therin / as God shall open his harte / and no syde to condempne or dispise the tother / but to nourishe in all thin¦ges brotherlye loue / and to beare others infyr∣mytes. The texte of saīt Austyn whiche they ther ale¦gyd agenst me / was this:S. Au∣stins tex. that in the sacrament Christe was borne in his owne handes. Wher∣vnto I sayd / that s. Austyn dothe full well expo¦unde him sellfe. For in a nother place he saythe Ferebatur tan{quam} in manibus suis. That is / he was borne after a certen maner / in his owne handes And by that he saythe after a certen maner / ye may sone perceaue what he meanythe. How be yt yf s. Austyn had not thus expoun¦did hym sellfe / yet the saythe ad Bonifacin̄ / that the sacrament of a thinge / hathe a similitude or propertie of the thinge whiche yt sygnifyethe. And for that cause yt hathe many tymes / the na¦me of the verye thīge which yt sygnifieth. And so he saythe that he bare him sellf / because he ba¦re the scrament of his body and bloude whiche dyd so ernestly expresse him sellfe / that nothyng
myght more do yt, If you reade the place of S Austen ad Bonifacium / whche I allege in my laste boke / ye shall sone see them answeryd. Chriso∣stomus.A nother place they allegyd out of Chriso∣stum / which at the fyrste blusshe semyth to make well for them. But yf yt be well wayed / yt ma∣keth moche lesse for them then they wene. The wordes are these. Chriso∣stoms wordes.Doist thou see brede & wine? do they departe from the into the draugte as other meates do? God forbidde for as in ware when yt cōmth to the fyer / nothynge of the substance remay∣nth nor abundyt: so lyke wse thyncke that the mysteryes are consumyd by the substance of the bod. These wordes I expoundd / by the wordes of the same doctor sainct Chrisostum / whiche in a nother homlye saythe on this maner. The inwarde eyes as sone as they se the breade / they flye ouer all creatures and thyncke not of the breade that is baken of the baker / but of the bre¦de of euerlastyng lyffe / whiche ys sygnifyed by the misticall brede. Now conferre these places to gther ad you shall erceaue / that the laste expoundyth the firste clerely. Fyrste he saythe / doyst thou see bre¦de and wne / I answere by the seconde / nay. For the inwarde es as sone as they see the bre∣de / thynck not of yt / but of the thynge yt sell∣fe that s sygnyfyed therby. And so he seyth yt and seth yt not. He seyth yt wyth hys out∣warde and carnall eyen / but hys inward eyen seyth yt not, That ys to saye / regarde not the
brede or thyncke not on yt Euē as we cōmely saye / whē we playe a gayme necglygēly (by my truthe I see not what I doe) meanyng that ou¦re mindes / is not apō that thīge whyche we ee wt o{ur} outwerde eyn. And like wise we may ans¦were the next parte / where he saythe. Doo they departe from the in to the draugh¦te / as other meates doo?The ex∣posicyo of aync Chryso∣sto. text. Nay forsouthe sayd I for other meathes doe ōly come to nouryshe the body / and to departe in to the draughte. But thys meate that I here receaue / ys spyrytuall meate / receyuid with faythe / ād nourysheth vs euerlastyngly / bothe body and sowle / ād neuer enterith into the draughte. And euē as before the outwarde eyn doe see the breade / and yet the inwarde eyn doe not regarde that or thyncke a∣pon yt. So lyke wise the outwarde man dyge∣syth the breade / & castythe yt in to the draugh¦te. And yet the inwarde man dothe not re∣garde that nor thyncke apon yt But thynky∣the on the thyng yt sellfe that ys sygnyfyed / by that breade. And therfore said Crysostum euen a lytle be¦forethe true meaning of Chri∣sostom{us} wordes. the wordes whyche they here allegyd / lyfte vp youre mynde ād hartes (sayde he) where by he monishith vs / to loke apon & cōsyder those heuenly thinges / wyche are represented and sy¦gnyfied by the breade ād wyne / and not to mar¦ke the breade and wyne in yt sellfe. Here they wil saye vnto me / that yt is not cry¦sostūs mynde (for by his exāple he playnly she wyth that there remanyth no brede nor wyne) that I denye. For the example in thys place /
prouith no more but that ye shall not thinke on the brede and wine / no more then yf they werre not there / but only on that thinge which i sign¦fied by them. And that ye may uidently prce∣ue by the wordes folowing where he saith / thin¦ke that the misterys are consumed by the substā¦c of the body. SolutiōNow wither Chrisostum thought that there remayned brede or non  bothe wayes shall oure purpos be prouyd. Firste yf he thought there re¦mayned still brede & wine / then we haue our pur¦pose. Now yf he thought that the brede and wi¦ne remayned not / but were chaunged / then are the brde & wine nether misteries nor sacramen¦ts of the body & bloude of christe. For that that is not / can nether be mister nor sacrament. Finally yf he speake of the outwarde appe∣raūce of breade:Conclu∣ion. then we knowe that that remay¦nith styll and is not consumed by the substance of the bodie. And therfore he muste nedes be vn¦drtond as I take him. I thincke many mn wonder how I cā dye in this article / seyng that yt is no necessary arti¦cle of oure faythe / for I graunte that neyther {per}te is an article necessary to b beleauyd vnder payne of dampnacion / but leue yt as a thinge in different / to thincke therin as god shall instyll in euery mans minde / and that neyther parte cō¦dempne other for thys mater / but receyue eche other in brotherly loue / reseruinge eche others inffirmite to god. Beholde he cause of my de¦the.The cause of my dethe is this / because I can not in consciens abiure and swere / that our pre¦lates
opinion of the sacrament (that is / that the substaunce of brede and wine is verely chaun∣ged in to the fleshe and bloude of our sauiour Ie¦sus Christ) is an vndouted / article of the fay∣the / necessary to be beleauid vnder paine of dāp¦nacyon. Now thoughe thys opynion wer in deade true (wiche thinge they can nether proue true by scripture nor doctors) yet coule I not inNote. consciens graunte that yt shulde be an artycle of the faythe necessari to be beleuid &c. For the¦re are many verites / whiche yet may be no uche articles of our faithe. Its true that I lay in  I wrote this / how be yt I wolde not receaue rōs whē this truthe for an article of oure faythe For you may thinke the contrary wt out all Ieo¦perdy of damnacion. ¶The cause why I can not beleue there opinion of transmutacion is this. Fyrste because I thincke verely that yt ys3. caes. faulse ād can nether be proued by scripture nor faithfull doctoures / yf thy be well pondered. The second cause is this / because I will not bynde the congregacion of Chrise (by myn ex∣ample) to admitte any necessary article by syde oure crede / and specialy none suche as can not be proued true by sripture. And I say that the churche / as they caue yt / can not cōpelle vs to receaue any suhe articls to be of necessite vn∣der payne of dampnacion. The thirde cause is / because I dare not be so presumptuous in entering in to goddes Iudg¦ment / as to make the prelates in this poynte an
necessary article of oure faythe. For then I shul¦de dampnably condempne all the germanes ād Allmaynes / wyth infinite moo / whyche in dea∣de do not bealeue nor thyncke that the substan∣ce of brede and wine ys chaunged in to the sub¦stance of Christes naturall body. And surely I can not be so folishe hard as to condempne su¦che an infinite nombre for oure prelates plea∣sures. Thus all the Germaynes and Allmaynes / bothe of Lutherrs syde and also of Oecolampa¦dius / doo hooly approue my mater. And surely I thincke ther ys noman that hathe a pure con¦science / but he wyll thyncke that I dye ryghtuously. For that this transub∣stāciation shuld be a necessary arti¦cle of the faythe / I thyncke no man can say yt wt a good con¦science / all though yt we∣re true in dede.
