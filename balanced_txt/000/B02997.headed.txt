THE which day, Forasmuch as the Lord Provest, Bailʒies and Council of Edinburgh, taking to their serious consideration, how zealous and careful his Sacred Majesty, hath been since His happy Restauration, for suppressing all Conventicles, Unwarrantable meetings, and Conventions of His Subjects within this Kingdom, by several laudable Laws and Acts of Parliament, made against the same: And also that by the 17 Act of of the 3d. Session of His Majesties 2d Parliament, It is expresly Statute and Ordained, That all Magistrates of Burghs-Royal shall call before them all such as are Burgesses, as shall be guilty of keeping Conventicles: and proceed against them by Fyning, or otherwise ac∣cording to Law, and that they make an account of their diligence to His Majesties Privy Council, and that they be careful in putting their Acts to due Execution against the p∣ers of Conventicles, conform to the Trust and Power committed to them, and that an ac∣compt of their Proceedings be returned yearly to His Majesties Privy Council upon the first day of July, under the pain of 500. merks, for each years Failʒie: They therefore be∣ing sensible of the Duty and Trust committed to them by His Majesty and Estates of Parliament; and that it is absolutely necessary for His Majesties Service, and for the peaceable and quiet Government of the good Town; and that all effectual means be taken for suppressing of Conventicles within the City and Privi∣ledges thereof, which tends so much to the prejudice of the publick Worship of God, to the scandal of the reformed Religion, and is the reproach of His Majesties Authority and Government: And also, that the slow progress hitherto made, in discovering and suppressing of Conventicles, Unlawful-Baptisms and Marriages, and entertaining of Inter∣communed and vagrant Persons, did proceed from this, that there was no due Incouragment or Reward promised and allowed, to such persons as should discover any Conventicles or Unwarrantable meetings within this City and Privi∣ledges thereof.

They do hereby require all the Citizens and other Inhabitants whatsoever in the said Burgh and Jurisdictions thereof, duly to attend the publick Ordinances and Worship; Certifying all such as shall absent themselves, or withdraw therefrom, that they shall be impartially Fyned ac∣cording to Law.
