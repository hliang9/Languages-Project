Hereford. May it please Your most Sacred Majesty. SInce we are very sensible that no Age hath ever yet produc'd any Prince that hath with more Justice, Goodness and Mercy, swaid the Scepters of the three Kingdoms (Bles∣sings which our Forefathers never had in a more eminent degree of Perfection, and all other Nations never yet knew) We conceive it our Duty to manifest to Your Majesty and all the World, our just value and grateful apprehensions of the happiness we enjoy un∣der the best of Kings, and most upright of Governments: And however some ill Men to accomplish their black designs by attempt∣ing to subvert the Government, slily insituate to the credulous People, causeless Fears and false Jealousies of Arbitrary Power growing upon us, yet the publick Manifestations Your Majesty hath at all times given to your Peo∣ple of Your Governing by the Laws of the Land, and by no other Method (which we find Your Majesty holds to inviolably, and and maintains as Sacred) keep us as safe from such mean apprehensions, as we are secure from the dismal Effects of such a way of Go∣vernment, which we have no cause to suspect, unless it be from those that suggest it, nor from them neither, till they have subverted a well temper'd Monarchy, and introduc'd their be∣lov'd Tyranical Republick. We cannot but with all humble duty, Loyal Gratitude, and excess of Joy, observe Your Majesties constant Endeavours to give satisfaction and Ease to the Minds of Your Majesties Subjects, not on∣ly in Your strict Adherence to, and Favour of the true Protestant Religion, but more e∣specially in Your late Declaration, which can∣not but stop the Mouths of the Seditious and Factious, preserve from Apostacy the doubtful, and confirm the Loyalty of Your best setled Subjects; And that Your Majesty may see that we are not poyson'd, or likely to be so by any Seditious and Factious Designers, we do una∣nimously and heartily assure Your Sacred Ma∣jesty, that we will stand by Your Majesty in the preservation of Your Person, Your Heirs and lawful Successors, and the Government in Church and State, as it is now by Law establish∣ed, with the last drop of our Bloud, and penny of our Fortunes; And shall be ready on alloc∣casions cheerfully to give You such large As∣sistances as (joyn'd with the proportionable Supplies of other Your Majesties Loyal Sub∣jects) may make Your Government great and easie to Your Self at home, and valued and feared by all Your Allies and Neighbours a∣broad. We humbly beg Your Sacred Majesty to give a gracious acceptance to the steddy re∣solutions of us Your most obedient and loyal Subjects, which no time, no treachery, no power, no fraud or faction, shall ever make us decline or alter. Your Majesties most Humble, Loyal, and Obedient Subjects and Servants. To the Kings most Excellent Majesty. address the City of Glouchester May it please Your most Sacred Majesty, WE Your Majesties most humble, Loyal, and Obedient Subjects, out of a deep Sense of Your most Princely tenderness and transcendent Care for us, and all Your good Subjects, as well in respect of our Religious as Civil Concerns, do make this our most Hum∣ble and Faithful Address, returning all possible Gratitude for Your Majesties most Gracious late Declaration, which hath like a Flood of Goodness, Issued from Your Royal Heart to∣wards all Your Subjects, whereby all Men that have not wilfully blinded their Intellects, may be abundantly satisfied of Your Majesties Fa∣therly Love to us all. We cannot but remember by What Frauds and Machinations the Subjects of this Your Majesties Realm in the late times were be∣guiled, and under pretext of Religion (and particularly this City, of which there was a most deserved Infamy brought upon us by Men of seditious Principles, the dregs of which still remain always watching to disturb our Peace) cheated into a Rebellion, the consequences whereof was a sad Devastation of all, and the loss of the best of Kings. And we have rea∣son to believe the same deadly poyson was again preparing, and had certainly been given, had not God put it into Your Majesties Heart timely, and most prudently to prevent it, As therefore we are bound to Glorifie God for His Mercy, so we make our most humble and grateful acknowledgement to Your Majesty for Your most intent Vigilance to save us from so portentous a Storm; and do therefore with all Humility and Faithfulness Prostrate our selves at Your Majesties Feet, solemnly vow∣ing before God and the whole World, That we are and will be ready, to the last drop of our Blood, and Mite of our Estates, to stand by and defend Your most Sacred Person, your lawful Successors, and the just Laws by which you govern both in Church and State. The God of Heaven and Earth, by whom Kings Reign, Bless you with length of Days, Health, and all affluence of Wealth; Establish Your Sacred Person in the hearts of your People. Dissipate your Enemies, and Confound their Devices; and let the Scepter of Great Britain be Sway'd by you and your Lawful Successors to the end ot Time. Several other Addresses have been pre∣sented to His Majesty, as from Bristol, Lyn-Regis, &c which there is not room to Pub∣lish here.
