DEVOL's last Farewel: Containing an Account of many frolicksom Intreigues and notorious Robberies, which he committed: Concluding vvith his mournful Lamentation, on the Day of his Death. To the Tune of, Æ²pon the Chnnge. Licens'd according to Order. YOu bold undaunted Souls attend To me, who did the Laws offend; For now I come to let you know What prov'd my fatal overthrow, And brought my Glory to decay; it was my Gang, for whom I hang, Well-a-day, well-a-day. Vnto a Duke I was a Page, And succour'd in my tender Age, Vntil the Devil did me intice, To leave of Vertue, and follow Vice; No sooner was I led astray, but Wickedness, did me possess, Well-a-day, well-a-day. If I my Crimes to mind shou'd call, And lay them down before you all, They would amount to such a Sum, That there is few in Christendom, So many wanton Pranks did play; but now too late, I mourn my fate, Well-a-day, well-a-day. Vpon the Road, I do declare, I caus'd some Lords and Ladies fair, To quit their Coach, and dance with us; This being done, the Case was thus, They for their Musick needs must pay; but now at last, those Ioaks are past, Well-a-day, well-a-day. Another time, I and my Gang, We fell upon a Noble-man; In spite of all that he could do, We took his Gold and Silver too And with the same we rid away; but being took, for death I look, Well-a-day, well-a-day. When I was mounted on my Steed, I thought myself a Man indeed; With Pistol cock'd and glittering Sword, Stand and deliver, was the word, Which makes me now lament and say, pity the Fall of great Devol, Well-a-day, well-a-day. I did belong unto a Crew, Of as swaggering Blades as ever drew, Stout Whitherington and Dowglis both, We were all three engag'd by Oath, Vpon the Road to take our way; but now Devol, must pay for all, Well-a-day, &c. Because I was a Frenchman born, Some Persons treated me with scorn; But being of a daring Soul, Although my Deeds was something foul, My gaudy Plumes I did display, but now my Pride, is laid aside, Well-a-day, &c. I reign'd with an undaunted mind Some years, but now at last I find, The Pitcher that so often goes Vnto the Well, as Proverb shows, Comes broken home at last we say; for now I see, my Destiny, Well-a-day, &c. Then being brought to Iustice-hall, Try'd and condemn'd before them all; Where many noble Lords did come, And Ladies for to hear my Doom, Then Sentence pass'd, without delay, the Halter fast, and Tybourn last, In one Day, in one Day.
