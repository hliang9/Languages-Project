❧VNTO THE GODLIE AND CHRI∣stiane Reidar, Henrie Charteris, wischis grace, and peice from Iesus Christ our Saluiour. with the perpetuall assistence of his halic Spirite. IT is the commoun and accustomit maner (gentill reidar) of all thame quhilk dois prohemiate vpon ony vther manis wark, cheiflie to tra∣uel about twa pointis. The ane is, to declair the properteis of ye Au∣thour, nocht onlie externall, as his originall, birth, vocatioun, estait, strenth, giftis of the bodie, substance, & maner of leuing: bot alswa inter∣nall: as the qualiteis, habites, & dispositiones of the mynde, his ingyne, knawlege, wisdome, giftis of the Spirit, and all vther verre wis quhilk culd iustlie be knawin to haue bene in him. Bot seing it is nocht monie ʒeiris past, sen it hes pleisit the eternall God, to call our Authour, out of the miserabill and trubilsum calamiteis of this transiteric lyfe, vntil his celestiall ioy, and heuinlie habitatioun, swa that the memorie of him is bot as ʒit recent, & not out of the hartis of mony ʒit leuand, to quhome his haill maner of lyfe was better knawin than vnto me, I think it not greitlie neidfull to tary the thairon, bot will remit the to lerne it at yair mouthis. The vther is, to declair his maner of wryting, the vtiliie of his warkis, & quhat frute, profite, and commoditie may ensew and fol¦low to the diligent reidar and reuoluar of the samin. Nouther in this is it greitly neidfull to me to trauell, seing the samin may be maist esilie & perfytelie knawin be his awin pen. For besydis the plesand and delecta∣bill versiz, besyi the craftie and ingenious poeticall inuentionis, be∣sydis the frutefull and cōmodious Historyis, bath humane and diuine: baith recent and ancient: besydis the hailsum and notalil counsellis & admonitionis to Princis, to Prelates, & to all estatis, quhat vice or ini∣quitie rang in his dayis, quhilk he did not celue? not onlie of the spiri∣tuall, bot alswa of the temporall estait? quhat verteous or cōmend a bill fact, hes he not praisit, and desyrit to be had in the dew honour, and ho∣norabill estimatioun. Bot gif we fall consider and wey the tyme, quhen he did wryte the maist pairt of thir warkis, being ane tyme of sa greit & blind ignorance, of manifest and horribill abhominationis and abusis: it is to be meruell it how he durst sa planelie inuey agnis the wycis of all men: bot cheiflie of the spirituall estait, being sa bludie, & cruell bouche∣ouris. He neuer ceissit baith in his graue and merie materis, in cruis & in bourdis: in wryting, and in wordis to challenge and carp thame. It cūmis to my memorie ane prettie trik, quhilk sumtyme I haue hard re∣portit of him. The Kingis grace, Iames the Fyft, beand on ane certane tyme accumpany it with ane greit nowmer of his Nobillis, & ane greit menʒe of Bischoppis, Abbottis and Prelatis standing about he quiklie & prettilie inuentit ane prettie trik to teine yame. He cūmis to the King, and efter greit dewgard & salutationis, he makis him, as thocht he war
to requyre sum wechtie thing of the Kingis grace. The King persauād, demandis quhat he wald haue? he answeris: Schir, I haue seruit ʒour grace lang, & lukis to be rewardit as vtheris ar. And now ʒour maister Tailʒeour at the pleasure of God is departit, quhairfoir I wald desyre of ʒour grace, to bestow this lytil benefite vpon me, as ane part of reward of my lang seruice, to mak me ʒour maister tailʒeour. The King bele∣nand in deid his tailʒeour to be departit, sayis to him. Quhairto wald thow be my tailʒeour? thow can nouther schaip nor few? he answeris. Schir, that makis na mater: for ʒe haue geuin Bischoprikis and benefi∣ces to mony standing heir about ʒow: and ʒit can thay nouther teiche, nor preiche. And quhy may I not than asweill be ʒour tailʒeour, thocht I can nouther schaip nor sew: seing teiching and preiching is na les re∣quisite to thair vocatioū, than schiping & sewing is to ane tailʒeouris. The King incontinent persauit his consait, and leuch merilie thairat: bot the Bischoppis at sic bourding leuch neuer ane quhit. Na les ernist and vehement was he aganis thame, in his fairsis and publict playis, quhairin he was verray craftie & excellent. Sic ane spring he gaif yame in the play, playit besyde Edinburgh, in presence of the Quene Regent, and ane greit part of the Nobilitie, with ane exceding greit nowmer of pepill, lest and fra. ix. houris afoir none, till .vj. houris at euin, quhair a∣mangis mony baith graue materis, and merie trikkis he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Persone, ane Freir, and ane Nun. deckit vp in thair papi∣sticall ornamētis, and maner of rayment. And thairefter brocht in King correctioun, quha reformand sindrie deformiteis in his Realme, passit to the tryall of his Clergie. And find and thame to be altogidder Idiotis, vnworthie of ony functioun ecclesiasticall, decernit thame to be degradit of thair digniteis, and spulʒeit of thair officis: quhilk beand executit, & thay denudit of thair vpmaist garmentis, thay war fund bot verray fu∣lis, hypocrites, flatteraris, & nouchtie persones. Quhairby he signifyit to the pepill, that howsaeuer thay war estemit of the warld, thay had na¦thing quhairin thay micht iustlie glorie to be pastouris of Christis Kirk, and feidaris of his flock, bot onlie thair outward ornamentis, and tri∣umphant tytillis. Bot beand inwardlie considerit, thay wald be fund bot verray hyrelingis, enemeis to Christ, & deuoraris of his flock. This play did enter with sic greif in thair hartis, that thay studyit be all me∣nis to be auengit thairof. Thay conuenit thair prouinciall counsellis, thay consultit how thay suld best sustene thait kingdome inclynand to ruyne, quhilk lairlie had gottin sa publict ane wound: thay ʒeid about to haue his haill warkis condempnit, for hereticall, and cessit not in Kirk and market, publictlie and priuelie, to rage and rayll aganis him, as ane Heretike. Bot to returne to our purpose. Nochtwithstanding the bir∣nand fyre borne aganis him in thair breistis, the hatreut cōsauit in thair hartis, thair puissance and power euin in that tyme, quhen thay had the ball at thair fute, quhen nouther Prince, nor vther was abil to withstād
thame, ʒit culd thay neuer get power ouer this sempil man, nor haif ya harus satiat of him. Thay had thair Canoun Lawis: thay had the Mu∣nicipal Lawis of the Realme, and actis of Parliament haldin be yat sa∣min King, quhame he seruit, with quhon crom his ʒouth vp he cōuer∣sit, that na man suld ressoun or call in dout the authoritie of thair spiri∣tuall Father: that Imagis suld be honourit: that the libertie of hali Kirk (as thay namit it) suld be mantenit, and defendit. And gif ony war suspectit in ony hereticall point, aganis the cōmandementis of this yair Kirk, incontinent thay war cytit, thay war apprehendit, and incarcerat in strang presoun: & finallie thay war cōpellit outher to abiure (quhair∣throw thay remamt infamit all thair dayis, nouther micht enioy honou∣ris, nor digniteis for thair tyme) or ellis thay behourt maist cruellie suf∣fer the fyre. How cūmis it than, that this our Authour being sa plane a∣ganis thame, and as it war professit enemie to thame, culd eschaip thair snairis, quhen vtheris in doing les hes cruellie perischit? Sum will think, because his wryting was cōmounlie mixit with mowis, and col∣lourit with craftie consaitis (as Chaucer and vtheris had done befoir) the mater was the mair mitigatt. Bot this can not satisfie: for na mow∣is in sic materis culd mitigate thair bludie breistis. Sum will think be∣cause he was continuallie in Court, and seruit the King, he was esilie ouersene. Bot in my iugement, that is the greiter cause of offence: name∣lie to haif thair vaniteis and wickitnes publischit in Court, and sicht of Princis Nouther culd this be saiftie to vtheris. M. Patrik Hammilto Abbot of Feirn, being of the blude Royall, being ane man of greit lite∣rature, and of sic lyfe, that the verray enemeis thame sellis war enforcit to commend and allow him. Ʒit did he nocht eschaip thair malice, bot sufferit cruell deith be fyre. Robert Forester alswa gentilman on the sa∣min maner was tormentit. And howbeit thir did cruellie perische, ʒit in all agis, and in all nationes, it hes plesit God, of his greit mercy, to rais and steir vp his Prophetis and seruandis, quhame he hes michtilie pre∣seruit, to repreif the generationis present of thair vnrichteousnes: to vt∣ter and oppin to the pepill the corruptioun than regnand: and as it was aganis the Deuill, and the warld to testifie his treuth: to walkin thame out of thair Ignorance. He steirit vp the auld and ancient Doctouris, to impugne and stranglie confute all heresyis springand and rysand. Bo thame at this present I will omit for breuitie, & will speik rather sum∣quhat sen corruptioun and superstitioun enterit amangis thame, quhilk war rewlaris and Pastouris of the Kirk of God: sen thay begouth to leif preiching of pure Christ, and to set vp thame selfis: to conquers Re∣almis, prouincis, and cuntreis: to subdew Princis and Potestates: and finallie to exalt thame selfis aboue all that is callit God. In quhilk day∣is war mony leirnit men, & godlie Bischoppis in this cuntrir: as Ser∣uanus, Columba, Aidanus, Finnanus, Colmannus, Leuinus, Bailus, and mony ma, quha baith in this Realme, and in Ingland, did lang de∣bell,
and hald out the Romische superstitionis, and ceremoneis, as is at lenth contenit in the auld Historyis of Beda, and vtheris. He rasit vp alswa in the dayis of Carolus Magnus, twa of our cuntrie men, baith of greit eruditioun and leirning, the ane callit Iohne, surnamit Mailrosius: the vther Claudius Clemens. Thir twa passand out of Scotlād, at cōmand of King Achaius (as Boethius wrytis) to ye partis of France, come to Paris, and war the occasioun of the fundatioun of ye Vniuersitie of the samin, & sindrie vtheris, and war the first professouris of liberall sciencis in thame. Nouther ceissit thay with ane Adelbertus ane Frencheman, and Bertramus, to inwey on ye stait of ye Kirk, than tendand and declynand fast to corruptioun, vntill Claudius, & Adelber∣tus war clappit in clois presoun, and Iohne departit the cuntrie, & come in Ingland: quhair (as sum wrytis) at the perswasioun of certane Mon∣kis, he was slaine, be certane his awin discipulis, impaciēt of his admo∣nitiones and correctionis. Efter thir quhen the sindrie ectis of Freiris began to spring vp, he raisit in France Builielmus de. S. Amore: Ni∣gellus: Nicolaus, and Arnoldus de villa noua: in Italie ye Abbot Ioa∣chimus Calaber: in Germanie, Hildegardis ye Prophetes with sindrie vtheris, quhilk stranglie wrait aganis the superstitionis and Idilteth of the begging Freiris, and vther abusis of the Clergie. And howbeit yair admonitiones culd not be hard, nor thr wryting tane in gude part, bot vtterlie reiectit and despysit, ʒit war thay not cūmit to that furie & rage, as to bruyle and scald quha sa euer suld speik aganis thame, bot cōtentit thame selus with presoun, or banischement of sic persones, as war con∣trarious to thame, degraiding thame of thair digniteis and offices: and excōmunicating thame out of thair Kirkis. Bot quhen thair iniquiteis was cūmin to maturitie, God raisit vp in Ingland, Iohne Vicleif, quha scand the haill ecclesiasticall estait, to be altogidder corrupt: the word of God, to be cūmit to neglect, and contempt: and mēnis traditionis aboue it to be extollit: did maist ernistlie teiche, and wryte ane huge nowmer of volumis and bukis aganis thame. Than was the beist vnquyetit of his resting sat, and began to rage and fret, to seik the deith and destructioun of this pure mā. Bot all for nocht. The Lord did potentlie preserue him from yair snairis and girnis: and nothwithstanding all thair furie, de∣partit in the Lord in peice. And howbeit efter deith Rancour cōmounlie reissis, ʒit .xlj. ʒeiris efter his with, ya tuke vp his banis and brint yame. Persewand alswa with maist extremitie all that adheirit to him, or did allow his doctrine. Thay brint the Lord Cobham, Schir Roger Actoū Knicht, Williame Thorpe, Williame Tayleir, Richard Howedē, Iohne Clerdoun. Thay banischit Elenor Cobhame: thay murderit in presoun Iohne Astoun, Reginald Pecock Bischop of Chichester, with ane infi∣nite noumber ma. Thair was na end in thair furie. Quhill thay war thus busie in Ingland, began Iohne Hus, and Hierome of Braga to preiche in Boheme, men of sic leirning, and lyfe, that thay war in admi∣ratioun
euin to the verray aduersaris thame selfis, quhairof remanis ʒit sufficient testimoneis writtin be Poggius, and vtheris of the Antichri∣stiane menʒe. Thay beand cytit to the counsall of Constance, come vpon ane saifconduct of Sigismundus the Empriour, than king of Boheme, present at the counsall: and thair gaif ane resoun & declaratioun of thair faith, and doctrine: fra the constant professioun quhairof, quhen yai culd nocht be disswadit: thay contrair the saifconduct, contrair all promises, cruellie brint thame. Satisfyand the Empriour, with this godlie Law, of thair awin forgeing, Quod nulla fides sit hereticis seruanda: Thair is na promis to be keipit to heretikes. Quhat frute this gudelie Law hes wrocht, the battell betuix the Turk, and Lowes king of Vngarie, and Boheme, & the occasioun thairof quhair the said Lowes perischit, to the greit hurt of all Christianitie, will declair: and mony vther histories al∣swa, quhilkis for schortnes I omit. Now our Prelates laith to ly be∣hind, willing to schaw yair gude seruice to ye halie Sait, apprehēdit heir in Scotland, Paull Craw, teiching the doctrine, quhilk Vicleif & Hus had teichit, & maid ane Sacrifice of him in Sanctandrois. And findand the sawour of this Sacrifice fragrant and smelland thay tuke the Vicar of Dolour, Freir Kelour, Symsone, Bawerage, kennedie, Stratoun, Bourlay, and mony ma, quha because yai culd not allow yair vaine su∣perstitiones and Idolatries, expres aganis the cōmandemēt of ye Lord thair God war cuttit of be the fyre. Thay had now lernit to dispute with fyre & faggot, for our auld Bischoppis & Pastouris war decayit, quhilk{is} war wōt to be lampis, and as it war leidsternis, to all nationis adiacēt: from quhome passit furth mony lernit men to all cuncreis, to Ingland, France, Germanie, Saone, Pruse, and vther partis, as thair Chroni∣killis testifyis, plantand and teichand the Christiane faith, & all godlie sciencis. Bot now dull Asynis had ascendit to thair rowmis, beand ma∣ryit with dame propertie, and riches, and fair lady Sensualitie: and swa efter ye rait of vther Realmis, war becūmit Idil bellyis, Ignorāt blok∣kis, and dum doggis. Nouther war thay Idill in Italie: thair cruellie sufferit Thomas Rhedonensis the Carmelite. And in Florence the god∣lie blak Freir, Hieronymus Sauoronola. Thus cōtinewand yair rage in all Realmes, euin to the vttermaist of yair power, it pleisit ye mercy∣full God, of his greit mercy, & fauourabill lufe towartis man, quhairby he wald not haif man vtterlie to perische, to gif (as it war) lycht to the warld: and that be reueilling of his word and Euangel, be the mouthis of his seruandis Luther, Bucer, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, & mony vtheris: be quhome he hes discouerit yair cankerit corruptioun, & auld festur in sic sort, yat na mā (except he wilbe wilfullie blind) may not persaif ye vennome & fylth thairof. And ʒit hes ye maist part of yir (how saeuer ye poweris of ye warld hes bene cōtrarious to yame) departie in ye Lord, in quietnes. Now sum wil say, thir war preicheouris, & Mini∣steris of the word, and had bene sumtyme auoyntit schauelingis, marit
with the beistis mark, and had maid defectioun from thame, quhairfoir thay persewir thame the mair scharplie and cruellie. Bot the Lord Cob∣hame, Robert Forester, Straitoun, wer nouther schauelingis nor prei∣cheouris. Richard Mekinnis ane boy of .xvij. ʒeiris of age, brint in Lō∣doun, was na preicheour. The lyke Iugement sufferit Maistres An As∣kew, with mony wemen, quhilk ʒit war na preicheouris. Ʒit forther sum will obiect the equitie of the tyme, quhairin our Authour leuit: that the power of the aduersaries was restraynit, that thay culd not rage and rin at ryot at thair libertie, and plesour, as thay war wont. And ʒit ane ly∣till befoir his deith thay brint. M. George Vischart, and Adam Wallace Mariner. And schortlie efter our Authouris deith, thay tuke the auld mā Walter Mill, and cruellie brint him: althocht fra that fyre rais sic ane stew, quhilk struke sic sturt to thair stomokis, that thay rewit it euer ef∣ter. Than hes it not bene seriousnes intermixit with iocunditie: it hes nocht bene continuall abyding nor seruing in court, it hes nocht bene blude royall, nor fauour of Princes: nouther teiching nor preiching: nor equitie of tyme, culd be protectioun to ony aganis sa cruell and feirs ad∣uersaries, of equall will, rage, and furie indifferentlie aganis all. It is rather the prouydence, the Iugement, the power, and the inmensibill fauour, and mercy of God towartis his sanctis and elect: quhilk vpō ye ane part, of his lufe towardis his chosin, to satisfie thair thrist, & desyre, quhilk thay had to be dissoluit, and to be with Christ, yat yai suld not be langer enforcit to behald ye wickit vaniteis of yis warld: Partlie of his iust Iugement, because the warld was not worthie of thame, for it hes lufit mirknes rather yan licht, and delytit mair in leis yan in ye treuth. And partlie to manifest to all pepill ye cruell, bludie, & insatiabil hartis of ye memberis of Antichrist, ye pilleris of the malignant Kirk, he did (as it wer) gif ouir into yair handis, ye lyfis, ye possessionis, gudis, and quhatsumeuer externall thing yai had, to be maid mokking stokkis, & to be disponit at thair libertie, and plesour. On the vther pairt, to declair his michtie prouidēce, and power, quhairby he wil not suffer ane hair of the heidis of his chosin to perische, but his permissioun: and to encorage his elect, seing yat nouther gude nor euill can fall vnto yame, by ye will of yair Father: he hes maist michtilie manteynit yame, amāgis ye mid∣dis of yis malignant generatioun. This Iugement man we lykewise haif of our Dauid Lyndesay: to quhome we will returne, omittand the special abusis of the Clergie, for eschewing of prolixitie, & tediousnes, to be socht out of his awin warkis be ye diligent reidar. Now as he hes bene scharp and vigilant in marking ye enormities of the spiritualitie, swa hes he not bene negligent, nor sleuthfull in rebuking ye defaltis of ye temporalitie, and all estatis yairof. He hes not spairit King, Court, Counsalouris, Nobilitie, nor vtheris of inferiour estait. And howbeit yai war not altogidder cūmit to sic corruptioun and furie, yat yai micht not beir mair equallie, with generall admonitionis and reprochis, yan
the spiritualitie. Ʒit als lytill amendement followit in the ane stait, a in the vther. Quhat laubouris tuke he, that the landis of this cuntre micht be set out in Fewis, efter ye fassioun of sindrie vther Realmes, for the incres of policie, and riches? Bot quhat hes he profitit? Quhen ane pure man with his haill raice and ofspring hes laubourit out yair lyfis, on ane lytill peice of ground, and brocht it to sum point and perfectioū: thā must the Lairdis brother, kinisman, or surname haif it: and ye pure man, with his wyfe, & babeis, for all yair trauellis, schot out to beg yair meit. He yat tuke lytill laubouris on it, man enioy ye frutes, and cōmo∣diteis of it: he man eit vp the sweit & laubouris of ye pure mānis brow∣is. Thus the pure dar mak na policie, nor bigging, in cace yai big yame selfis out. Bot althocht men wink at yis, and ouirluke it, ʒit he sitts a∣boue yat seis it, and sal Iuge it. He yat heiris ye sichis & complaintis of ye pure oppressit, sall not for euer suffer it vnpunischit. Quhat hes he alswa writtin aganis yis Heriald hors, deuysit for mony pure mannis hurt? Bot quha hes dimittit it? finallie, quhat oppressioun or vice hes he not repreuit? Bot yir sall suffice for exempill. And gif he had leifit in yir lait dayis, quhat had he said, of ye vnnatural murtheris: ye cruel slauch∣teris: ye manifest reiffis: ye continuall heirschippis: ye plane oppressi∣onis: ye lytill regard of all persones to ye cōmoun weilth: ye mantening of derth, to the vniuersall hurt of the pure in transporting of victuallis furth of ye Realme, cōtrarie to ye statutis yairof, for ye particular weill of few, & hurt of mony: the Importing of greit quantiteis of fals cunʒe, sklenderlie serchit, and lychtliar punischit: The multitude of Kirkis destitute of Ministeris throw the hail cūtrie: The slaw administratioun of Iustice, and fer les executioun: with all kynde of impieteis (as it wer) publictlie, and frelie Regnād. Ʒit nochtyeles we luke for redres and re∣formatioun of all sic horribil deformiteis, at ye handis of sic rewlaris, as God hes, and sall strenthin with his Spirit, lychtin with ye pure word of his Euangel, endew with his feir (quhilk is ye beginning of all wis∣dome) with sic knawlege, sic Iugement, and ʒeill, yat yai sall to yair vt∣termaist endeuour, auance, and set fordwart all Iustice, and equitie, and suppres all vice and iniquitie: to ye glorie of God: to ye auancement of his word: to ye edificatioun of his Kirk, and to ye confort, and quietnes of yis trubillit, and afflictit commoun weilth. Quhilk God of his greit mercie, grant that we may schortlie se. Amen. I haue alreddie passit ye boundis of ane preface: ʒit ane thing restis to admonische ye (gentill reidar) of yir warkis following. The mait part of yame hes bene sindrie tymes in sindrie places imprentit: as heir in Scotland, quhilk ʒit war not sa correct, as neid requyrit. Thay haif bene Imprentit in Rowen, bot altogidder sa corrupt and fals, that na man can be abill, to atteyne to the Authoris mynde be yame. For besydis the wrang Ortographie, and fals spelling, the transpositiones of wordis, & lynis: yair is alswa sic defectiones, yat sumtymes wil want twa, or thre
lynis in ane sentence: sumtymes als mony abound, and be doublit. Quhairthrow the myndis of honest men ar alienatit from reiding of sa frutefull warkis: ʒouth is abusit and corruptit: the Authour, and his warkis schamefullie blottit, and barbulʒeit: the cūtrie infamit: & sic per∣sonis as laubouris for iust correctioun vtterly discuragit, scand thair lauboures, and trauellis sa haistelie yairefter to be corruptit, at the pri∣uate appetite and grednes of certane godles Ignorantis: quhilk in re∣spect of yir greit hartis, deseruis na small punischement. Thay ar lyke∣wise laitlie Imprentit in Londoun, with lytill better succes than ye v∣ther. For yai haif gaue about to bring thme to ye southerne language, alterand ye vers and collouris yairof, in sic placis, as yai culd admit na alteratioun: quhairfoir ye natiue grace, and first mynd of ye wryter, is oftentymes peruertit And for ye Ortographie, transpositiones, and defectiones, thay ar almaist commoun with the vther. Thus seing this famous Authour, and his notabill warkis to be sa velanouslie handillit, and sa miserabillie, and malitiousie mankit, and alterat: we haif gane about, and takin sum trauellis, to vindicate yame from yir blottis, & corruptiones: and to reduce, and bring thame to the natiue integritie, and first mening of ye wryter. Quhilk salbe esilie per∣sauit in ye reiding: bot maist esilie, gif ony wil confer this editioun with yame yat hes pre ceidit: quhairin quhat difference is betuix rycht & wrāg wryting, betuix correct, and vncorrect Imprenting salbe cleirlie sene.

Than to the Serpent, God said thus, O thow Desauer venemous, Because the woman thow begylit Frome thyne furth sall thow be exilit. Curst and varyit sall thou be,
So sall thy seid be efter the. Cauld erth salbe thy fude also And creipand on thy breist sall go Als I sall put Enemite Betuix the woman euer and the Betuix thy seid, and womannis seid Salbe continuall mortall feid. Quhowbeit thow hes wrocht thir myscheuis It sall nocht be as thow beleuis Sic seid salbe in woman sawin That thy power salbe doun thrawin, Tredding thy heid that thow may feill And thow sall tred hym on the heill. This was his promis, and mening That the Immaculate Virging Suld beir the Prince Omnipotent Quhilk suld tred doun that fals Serpent Sathan and all his companie And thame confound alluterlie. (Quod I)Courteo. geue Sathan prince of hell Spak in the Serpent as ʒe tell And beistis can no way syn at all Quhy wes the Serpent maid so thrall? I heir men say afore that hour The Serpent had ane fair figour And ʒeid straucht vp vpon his feit And had his memberis all compleit As vtheris beistis vpon the bent.

And so befell of the Serpent It was the Feynd full of despyte Of Adamis fall quhilk had the wyte, As he hes had of mony mo Bot tyll our purpose lat vs go. Than to the woman for hir offence God did pronunce, this sore sentence. All plesou that thow had a sorrow Sall changit be in lesting sorrow. Quhare that thow suld with mirth and Ioy Haue borne thy birth but pane or noy Now all thy barnis sall thow bair With dolour and continuall cair, And thow salbe for oucht thow can Euer subiectit to the Man. Be this sentence, God did conclude Wemen frome libertie denude. Quhilk be experience ʒe may se Quhow Quenis of most hie degre Ir vnder most subiectioun And sufferis most correctioun.
For thay lyke birdis in tyll ane cage Ar keipit ay vnder thirlage. So all wemen in thare degre Suld to thare men subiectit be. Quhowbeit sum ʒit wyll stryue for stait And for the maistrie mak debait, Quhilk gif thay want, boith euin & morrow Thare men wyll suffer mekle sorrow Of Eue, thay tak that qualite To desyre Soueranite.

For Noe dwelt in that Ark but dout Ane ʒeir compleit,Gen. viii or be come out Quhow at more lenth, in holy wryte This dulefull historie bene Indyte, And quhow that Noe, gan to teiose Quhen Conductis of the heuin did close, So that the Rane, no more discendit, Nor the flude no more ascendit. Quhen be persauit the heuinnis cleir Hasend furth Corbie Mesfingeir In to the air, for to espy Geue he saw ony montanis dry. Sum sayis the Rauin, did furth remane And come norht to the Ark agane.

That fellown Flude, was decressand. And so it did, tyll at the last The Ark vpon the ground stak fast On the top of ane Montane hie In to the land of Armenie. And quhen that Noe had done espy, Quhow that the erth began to dry, Than dang he doun the durtis all, And lousit thame, the quhilk wes thrall. The foulis flew furth in the air, And all the beistis pair and pair, Past furth to seik thare Pastorages. Thare wes than bot aucht Personages Noe, his thre Sonnis, and thare wynis On erth, that left was with thare lyuis, Gene. ix.Quhome God did blis, and Sanctifie, Say and incres, and multiplie. God wat geue Noe, wes blyith and glaid Quhen of that presone he wes fraid. Quhen Noe had maid his Sacrifice, Thank and God of his Benefice, He standyng on mont Armenie Quhare he the countrie micht espie Ʒe may beleue, his hart was sore Seing the erth, quhilk wes afore The Flude, so plesand and perfyte Quhilk to behald, wes greit delyte That now was barren maid and bair Afore, quhilk fructuous was and fair.

Rychtso the erth, as bene decydit In syndrie partis, wes nocht deuydit, As bene Europe, and Asia Deuydit ar, frome Africa. Ʒe se now diuers Famous Ilis

Thare wes none sey Mediterrane, Bot onely the greit Occeane, Quhilk did not spreid sic bullering strandis As it dois now, ouirthort the landis. Than be the raging of that flude The erth of bertew wes denude, The quhilk afore wes to be prysit Quhose bewte than wer disagysit. Than wes the Maledictioun knawin Quhilk wes be God, till Adam schawin. I reid quhow Clerkis dois conclude Induring that most furious flude With quhilk the erth wes so supprest, The wynd blew furth of the southwest As may be sene be experience. Quhow throw the watteris violence The hich montanis in euery art, Ar bair forgane the southwest part. As the montanis, of Pyreneis The Alpes, and Rochis in the seis. Rycht so the Rochis greit and gray Quhilk standis into Norroway.

❧FATHER I pray ʒow to me tell. The First Infortune that befellCourteo. Immediatlie efter the flude And quho did first sched saikles blude And quho Idolarrie began? (Quod he) I sall do as I can. Efter the Flude, I find no historieExperien Worthy to put in memorie Tyll Nimrod began to King, Aboue the peple as ane King,Gene. x. Quhilk wes the principall man of one That beildar wes of Babilone. That historie Maister wald I knaw (Quod I) geue ʒe the suthe wald schaw, Quhy, and for quhat occasiounCourteou Thay beildit sic one strang Doungeoun? Than said to me Experience I sall declare with diligenceExperien Those Questionis, at thy command. Bot first Sone, thow mon vnderstand Of Nimrod, the Genealogie, His strenth curage, and Quantite. Quhowbeit Moyses in his first Buke, That historie lichtlie did ouer luke, Of hym no more, he doith declare Except he was ane strang Huntare Bot vtheris Clerkis curious As Orose doith, and Iosephus, Discryuis Nimrod at more lenth, Boith of his stature, and his strenth, This Nimrod was the fourt persoun
Frome Noe belyne discending doun. Noe generit Cham, Cham generit Chus, And Chus Nimrod, the suthe bene thus. This Nimrod grew ane man of micht, That tyme in erth, wes none so wicht. He wes ane Gyant, stout and strang Pet force wyld beistis he doun thrang, The peple of that hole Regioun Come vnder his Dominioun. No man thare wes in all that land His stalwartnes that durst ganestand. No maruell wes thocht he wes wicht, Ten Cubitis large, he wes of wicht. Proportionat in lenth and breid, Efferand to his hicht we reid. He grew so greit and glorious, So prydefull, and presumptuous, That he come Inobedient To the greit God Omnipotent. This Nimrod was the principall man That first Idolatrie began. Than gart he all the peple call Gene. xi.To his presence boith greit and small, And in that greit Conuentioun Did propone his Intentioun. My freindis (said he) I mak it knawin The greit vengeance that God hes schawin, In tyme of our fore Father Noe Quhen he did all the warld distroy.
And dround thame in ane furious flude, Quharefore, I think we suld conclude Quhow we may mak one strang defence Aganis sic watteris violence For to tesist his furious Ire Contrair boith to flude and fyre. Lt vs go spy sum plesand feild Quhare one strang bigging we may beild, One Cietie, with ane strang Dungeoun That none Ingyne may ding it doun, So hich, so thik, so large, and lang That God till vs sall do na wrang. It sall surmont the planetis semn. That we frome God may wyn the heuin. Those peple with one ferme intent All tyll his counsell did consent And did espy ane plesand plais Hard on the flude of Euphrates, The peple thare did thame repair In to the plaine feilde of Sinear, Quhilk now of Chaldie beris the name Quhilk did lang tyme flureis in fame. Thare greit Fortres, thā did thay found And kaist tyll thay gat souer ground. All fell to work, baith man and Chylde Sum holkit clay, sum brint the tyld. Nimrod, that curious Campioun Deuysar wes of that Dungeoun. Na thing thay spairit thare laubouris
Lyke besy beis vpon the flouris, Or Emmettis trauelling in to Iune Sum vnder wrocht, and sum aboue, With strang Ingenious Masonerie Vpwart thare work did fortifie, With brynt tyld stonis, large and wicht That Tour thay raisit to sic hicht Abufe the airis Regioun, And Iunit of so strong fassioun With Syment maid of pick and ter Thay vsit none vther morter. Thocht fyre or watter it assailit Contrair that Dungeoun nocht auailir. The land about wes fair and plane. And it rais lyke ane hich montane. Those fulische peple did intend That to the Heuin it suld ascend So greit one strenth wes neuer sene In to the warld with mannis ene. The wallis of that work thay maid Two and fiftie faldome braid. One faldome than, as sum men sayis Mycht bene twa faldome in our dayis. One man wes than of more stature Nor two be now, thareof be sure. ¶ Iosephus baldis opinioun Say and the hicht of this Dungeoun Of large pasis of mesure bene
Fyue thousand, aucht score, and fourtene. Be this rakning, it is full richt Fyue mylis, and ane half in hicht. Ane thousand pais, tak for ane myle And thow sall find it neir that style This toure in compas round about Wer mylis ten, withouttin dout, About the Cetie of Staidis Foure houndreth, and four score I wis. And be this noumer in compas About thre score of mylis it was, And as Orosius reportis Thare wes fyue score of brasin portis. The Translatour of Orosius In tyll his Cronicle wryttis thus, That quhen the Sonne is at the hicht At none, quhen it dois schyne maist bricht The schaddow of that hiduous strenth Ser myle and more, it is of lenth. Thus may ʒe Iuge in to ʒour thocht Geue Babilon be hich or nocht. ❧ How God ma∣id the Diuersite of Languagis, and maid Impediment to the Buildaris of Babilon.

So dirk Gelipsit wes his glore Quben thay wald wirk for hym no more. Behald quhow God wes so gracious. To thame quhilk wer so outragious.

Quhen Nimrod saw his purpose failit And his greit laubour nocht auailit, In maner of Contemptioun Departit furth of that Regioun, And as Orosius doith reherse He past in to the land of Perse. And mony one ʒeir, did thare remane And syne to Babilon come agane And fand huge peple of Chaldie Remanand in that greit Citie That wer glaid of his returning And did obey hym as thare king. Nimrod his Name for tyll auance Amang thame maid new ordinance: Say and I think ʒe ar nocht wyis That to none God makis Sacrifyis.

At that tyme, thare wes none vsage To arue, nor for to paynt Image. Than maid he Proclamatioun Quho maid nocht adoratioun To that new God, without remede In to that fyre suld suffer dede. I finde no man in to that land His tyrannie that durst ganestand Bot Abraham, and Aram, his brother That disobeyit, I find none vther Quhilk dwell and war, in that countrie With thare Father calit Thare.

Thir brether boith kest in the fyre, Abraham be God he wes preseruit, Bot Aram in the fyre he steruit. Quhen Thare, hard his Sone wes dede He did depart out of that stede, With Abraham, Nachor, and thare wyuis, As the Scripture at lenth discryuis. And left the land of Chaldea And past to Mesopotamia, And dwelt in Tharan all his dayis And deit thare, as the story sayis The lyfe of Abraham I suppose No thing langis tyll our purpose. In to the Bibill thow may reid His verteous lyfe, in word and deid. Now to the, I haue schawin the man That first Idolatrie began.

BBETHER of court, with mynd precordiall To the greit God, hartlie I cōmend ʒow, Imprent my fall, in ʒour memoriall, To gidder with this Edull that I send ʒow. To preis ouer hich, I pray ʒow not pretend ʒow, The vane ascens of court, quho wyll considder, Quho sittith most hie, sal ind ye sait most slidder. So ʒe that now, be lansing vp the ledder, Tak tent in tyme, festning ʒour singaris fast. Quho climmis most hich, most dint hes of ye wedder And leist defence aganis the bitter blast, Of fals fortune▪ quhilk takith neuer rest, Bot most redoutit daylie scho doun thringis, Not sparing Paipis, Conquerouris, nor Kingis. Thocht ʒe be montit vp aboue the skyis, And hes boith King, and court in gouernance, Sū was als hich, quhilk now richt lawly lyis, Complanyng sore the courtis variance. Thare pretrite tyme, may be experience, Quhilk throw vane hope of court did clym so hie, Syne wātit wingis, quhē thay wend best to fle. Sen ilk court bene vntraist and transitorie, Changing als oft, as weddercok in wind, Sum mak and glaid and vther sum richt sorie, Formaist this day, the morne may go behind, Lat not vane hope of court ʒour resone blind. Traist weill sum mē, wyl gif ʒow laud as lordis, Quhilk wald be glaid, to se ʒow hang in cordis,
¶I durst declair the myserabilite, Of diuers courtis, war not my tyme bene schort The dreidfull change, vane glore, and vilite The painfull plesour, as Poeitis doith report Sum tyme in hope, sum tyme in disconfort, And how sū mē dois spend thair ʒoutheid haill In Court, syne endis in the hospytaill. Quhow sum in court bene quiet counsalouris, Without regard to commoun weill or kingis, Casting thare cure for to be Conquerouris. And quhen thay bene hich raisit in thare ringis. How change of court yam dulfully doun thring{is}, And quhen thay bene frome thair estait deposit Quhow mony of thare fall bene richt reiosit. And quhow fond fenʒeit fulis and flatteraris For small seruice obtenis greit rewardis. Pandaris, pykthankis custrouis, ād clatteraris, Loupis vp frō laddis, syne lichtis amang lardis, Blasphemarouris, beggaris, & cōmoun bairdis, Sum tyme in Court hes more auctorite, Nor deuote Doctouris in Diuinite. Quhow in sum chuntre bene barnis of Beliall. Full of dissimulit payntit flatterie, Prouocand be Intoxicat counsall Princis till huredome, and till hasardrie, Quho dois in Princis prent sic harlotrie I say for me sic pert prouocatouris Suld punischet be abufe all strang tratouris.
Quhat trauers, troubill and Calamite? Haith bene in court, within thir houndreth ʒeiris Quhat mortal changis, and quhat miserie? Quhat nobil men, bene brocht vpon thair heiris, Traist weill my freindis, follow ʒe mō ʒour feiris So sen in Court bene uo tranquillite Set nocht on it ʒour hole felicite, The court changis sumtyme with sic outrage, That few or none, may makin refistence And spairis not the Prince, more than the page, As weill apperith be Experience: The Duke of Rothesay, micht mak no defence, Quhilk wes pertenand Roy of this regioun Bot dulefully deuorit in presoun. Quhat dreid quhat dolour, had that nobil king Robert the thrid, from tyme he knew the cace Of his two Sonnis dolent departing? Prince Dauid deid, and Iames captyne allace, Till trew Scottis mē quhilk wes a cairful cace. Thus may ʒe knaw, the court bene variand, Quhē blude royal, the change may not ganestād. Quho rang in court, more hie and tryumphand, Nor Duke Murdok, quhil that his day ourit? Was he nocht greit Protectour of Scotland? Ʒit of the court, he was nocht weil assurit. It changit so, his lang seruice was smurit, He and his Sone, fair Walter but remeid Forfaltit war, and put to dulefull deid.
King Iames the first, the patroun of prudence, Gem of Ingyne, and perll of policie Well of Iustice, and flude of Eloquence Quhose vertew doith transcend my fantasie, For tyll discryue, ʒit quhen he stude most hie, Be fals Exorbitant conspiratioun That prudent Prince, wes pieteouslie put doun. Als Iames the secund, Roy of greit renonn, Beand in his superexcellent glore Throuch rakles schuting of ane greit cannoun The dolent deith, allace did hym deuore. One thing thare bene, of quhilk I meruell more. That Fortune had, at hym sic mortall feid Throuch fiftie thousand, to wail hym be the heid. My hart is perst with panis for to pance, Or wryte that Courtis variatioun Of Iames the thrid, quhen he had gouernance, The dolour, dreid, and desolatioun, The change of Court, and conspiratioun, And quhow that Cochrane with his companie, That tyme in Court clam so presumpteouslie. It had bene gude, thai bernes had bene vnborne Be quhome that nobill Prince wes so abusit. Thay grew as did the weid abufe the corne, That prudent Lordis counsall wes refusit, And held hym quiet, as he had bene inclusit. Allace that Prince, be thare abusioun Was finallie brocht to confusioun.
Thay clam so hich, and gat sic audience, And with thare Prince, grew so familiar, His Germane brother, micht get no presence, The Duke of Albanie, nor the Erle of Mar, Lyke baneist men, was haldin at the bar, Tyll in the King, thare grew sic mortall feid, He flemit the Duke, and pat the Erle to deid. Thus Cochrane, with his catyue companie Forsit thame to fle, bot ʒit thay wantit fedderis Abuse the hich Cederis of Libanie, Thay clam so hie, til thay lap ouir thair ledderis, On Lawder brig, syne kaippit wer in tedderis, Stranglit to deith, thay gat none vther grace, Thair king captiue, quhilk wes ane cairful cace, Tyll put in forme, that fait Infortunate, And mortall change, perturbith myne ingyne. My wit bene waik, my fyngeris fatigate, To dyte, or wryte, the rancour and rewyne The Ciuill weir, the battell Intestyne, How that the Sone, with baner braid displayit Agane the Father, in Battell cum arrayit. Wald God ye prince had bene that day confortit With Sapience of the prudent Salomon, And wt ye strenth of strang Sampson supportit. With the bauld Oist of greit Agamemnon. Quhat suld I wis, remedie wes thare none At morne ane king, wt sceptour swerd and croun. At ewin, ane deid deformit carioun.
Allace quhare bene, that richt redoutit Roy, That potent prince, gentill king Iames ye feird I pray to Christ, his Saule for to conuey, Ane greiter nobill, tang nocht in to the end. O Atropus, warie we may thy weird For he wes Mirrour of humilite Lode sterne, and lamp of liberalitie. During his tyme, so Iustice did preuaill, The Sauage Iles, trymblit for terrour. Eskdale, Euisdale, Liddissdaill, and Anuandaill Durst nocht rebell, douting his dyntis dour, And of his Lordis, had sic perfyte fauour So for to schaw, that he effe it no fene Out throuch his realme, he wald tyde him alone. And of his court, throuch Europe sprāg ye fame. Of lustie Lordis, and lufesum Ladyis ʒing, Tryumphand tornayis iusting & knichtly game, With all pastyme, according for ane king. He wes the glore, of Princelie gouerning Quhilk throuch the ardent lufe he had to France Agane Ingland, did moue his Ordinance. Of Floddoun feild, the rewyne to reuolue, Or that most dolent day for tyll deplore, I nyll for dreid, that dolour ʒow dissolue, Schaw how that prince in his tryumphād glore Destroyit was, quhat nedith proces more, Nocht be the vertew of Inglis ordinance, Bot be his a win wilfull misgouernance.
Allace that day, had he bene counsalabill He had obtenit laud, glore, and victorie. Quhose picreous proces, bene so lamentabill, I nyll at lenth, it put in memorie. I neuer red, in Tragedie nor storie, At one Iornay, so mony Nobillis slane For the defence, and lufe of thare Souerane. Now brether mark, in ʒour remembrance, Ane Mirrour of those mutabiliteis. So may ʒe knaw, the Courtis inconstance, Quhen princis bene thus pullit frome thare seis. Efter quhose deith, quhat strange aduersiteis, Quhat greit misrewll, in to this Regioun rang Quhē our ʒong prince could nother spek nor gāg During his tender ʒouth, & innocence, Quhat stouth, quhat reif, quhat murthur & mischāce? Thair wes not ellis bot wraking of vengeance, In to that Court thare rang sic variance. Diuers rewlaris, maid diuers ordināce. Sum tyme our Qeuene, rang in auctoritie, Sum tyme the prudent Duke of Albanie. Sum tyme the realme, was reulit be Regentis, Sum tyme Lufetenentis, le. daris of the law. Than rang so mony Iobedientis, That few or none, stude of ane vther aw Oppressioun did so lowd his Bugill blaw, That none durst ryde, bot in to feir of weir, Iok vp onland, that tyme did mys his meir.
Quho was more hich, in honour eleuate, Nor was Margarete, our hich & michtie princes? Sic power, was to hic appropriate Of king, and realme scho wes gouernores. Ʒit come one change, within ane schort proces, That perle preclare, that lusty plesand quene, Lang tyme durst nocht in to the court be sene. The Archebischop of sāctādres Iames Betoun, Chancellare, and prima ein po et Pastorall Clam nyxt the king, most hich in this regioun, The ledder schuke, he lap and gat one fall, Auctorite, nor power spirituall, Riches, freindschip, micht not that tyme preuail, Quhen dame Curia began to steir hir taill. His hich prudence aualit hym nocht ane myte, That tyme the court bair hym sic mortall feid, As presoneir, thay keipt hym in despyte, And sum tyme wist not, quhare to hyde his heid. Bot disagysit, lyke Ihone the raif he ʒeid. Had nocht bene hope bair hym sic companie, He had bene stranglit, be melancholie. Quhat cummer & cair, wes in the court of france, Quhen king Francis, was takin presoneir? The Duke of Burboun, amyd his Ordinance Deid at ane straik, rycht bailfull brocht on beir? The court of Rome, that tyme ran all areir, Quhē Pape Clement, was put in strang presoun The nobill Citie, put to confusioun.
In Ingland, quho had greiter gouernance, Nor thare tryumphand courtly Cardinall, The commoun weill, sum sayis he did auance Be Equall Iustice, boith to greit and small, Thare wes no Prelate, to hym peregall. Inglismen sayis, had he roung langer space, He had deposit Sanct Peter of his place. ¶His princely pompe, nor Papale grauite, His palice royall, riche, and radious, Nor ʒit the flude of Superfluite Of his riches, nor trauell tedious, Frome tyme dame Curia, held hym odious Aualit hym nocht, nor prudence most profound, The ledder brak, and he fell to the ground. Quhare bene the douchtie Erlis of Dowglas Quhilkis royallie, in to this regioun rang? Forfalt and slane, quhat nedith more proces? The erle of Marche, wes merschellit yaim amāg, Dame Curia thame dulfullie doun thrang. And now of lait, quho clam more hich amang vs Nor did Archebald vmquyle the Erle of Angus. Quho with his Prince wes more familiar, Nor of his grace, had more auctorite? Was he nocht greit Wardane, and Chancellar? Ʒit quhen he stude vpon the hichest gre Traisting no thing, dot perpetuite, Was suddanlie deposit frome his place, Forfalt and flemit, he gat none vther grace.
Quharefor traist nocht in tyll auctorite My deir brether I pray ʒow hartfullie, Presume uocht in ʒour vane prosperite, Conforme ʒour traist, in God alluterlie, Sync serue ʒour Prince, with enteir hart trewlie.

To schaw thare fyne, my frayit hart affeiris: Sum murdrest war, sum poysouit preteouslie Thare cairfull courtis dispersit dulefullie. Traist weill thare is no constant court bot one, Quhare Christ bene king, quhose tyme īterminabill And hich triūphant glore beis nev{er} gone.

Quhen scho considerit lady Properte So hich exaltit in to Dignite. O Syluester, quhare was thy discretioun, Quhilk Peter did renunce, thow did resaue? Androw, and Ihone, did leif thare possessioun, Thair schippis, & nettis, lynis, and al the iaue, Of tēporall substance, no thing wald thay haue, Contrarious to thare contemplatioun Bot soberlie thare sustentatioun. Ihone the Baptist, went to the wildernes, Lazarus, Martha, and marie Magdalane Left veritage, and gudis more and les.

Traisting in to that court to get confort. Scho maid hir humill supplicatioun. Schortlie thay said, scho suld get na support, Bot bostit hir with blasphematioun, To Preistis go mak ʒour protestatioun. It is said thay, mony one houndreth ʒeir Sen Chaistite, had ony entres heir. Tyrit for trauell, scho to the preistis past, And to the rewlaris of Religioun.

Quhilkis sped thame at the post richt spedilie,
And set ane sege, proudlie about the place. The sillie Nonnis, did ʒeild thame haistelie, And humillie of that gilt askit grace, Syne gaue thare bandis of perpetuall pace. Resauand thame, thay kest vp wykket{is} wyde, Than Chaistite, thare no langer wald abyde. So for refuge, fast to the freiris scho fled, Quhilkis said, thay wald of ladyis tak no cure. Quhar bene scho now, than said the gredie gled? Nocht amang ʒow, said scho I ʒow assure. I traist scho bene, vpon the borrow mure, Besouth Edinbugh, and that richt mony menis Prof estamang the Sisteris of the Senis. Thair hes scho fund hir mother Pouerte, And Deuotioun, hir a win sister carnall. Thair hes scho fund, faith, hope and cherite, Togidder with the vertues Cardinall. Thair hes scho fund, ane Conuent ʒit vnthrall To dame Sensuall, nor with riches abusit. So quietlie, those ladyis bene Inclusit. The Pyot said, I dreid be thay assailʒeit, Thay rander thame, as did the holy Nonnis. Dout nocht (said scho) for thay bene so artailʒeit, Thay purpose to defend thame wt thair gunnis, Reddy to schute, thay haue sex greit Cannonnis, Perseuerance, Constance, and Conscience, Austerite, Laubour, and Abstinence. ¶ To resist subtell Sensualite,
Strongly thay bene, enarmit feit and handis, Be abstinence, and keipit pouerte, Contrair ryches, and all hir fals seruandis. Thay haue ane Bumbard, braissit vp in bandis, To keip thair port, in iniddis of thare clois, Quhilk is callit, Domine custodi nos. Within quhose schot thair dar no Enemeis Approche thare place, for dreid of dyntis dour, Boich nicht and day, thay wirk lyke besie beis, For thare defence, reddie to stand in stour, And hes sic watchis, on thare vtter tour, That dame Sensuall, with seige dar not assailʒe Nor cum within, the schot of thare artailʒe. The Pyot said, quhareto sulde thay presume. For to resyste, sweit Sensualite, Or dame riches, quhilk{is} reularis bene in Rome, Ar thay more constant, in thare qualite, Nor the princis of Spiritualite, Quhilkis plesandlie withouttin obstaikle Haith thame resauit, in thare habitakle. Quhow lang traist ʒe, those ladyis sall remane So solytar, in sic perfectioun? The Papingo said, brother in certane So lang as thay obey correctioun, Cheising thare heidis be electioun, Vnthrall to riches, or to pouerte, Bot as requyrith thare necessite. O prudent prelatis, quhare was ʒour prescience, That tuke on hand, tyll obserue Chastitie,
But austeir lyfe, laubour, and abstinence? ʒe nocht, the greit prosperite Appndlie, to cum of properte. Ʒe knaw greit cheir, greit eis and Idilnes, To Lecherie, was mother and maisties. Thow rauis vnrockit, the rauin said be the rude So to reproue, riches, or properte. Abraham, and Isaac, war riche and veray gude Iacob, and Ioseph, had prosperite. The Papingo said, that is verite. Riches I grant, is nocht to be refusit, Prouiding alwayis, that it be nocht abusit. Than said the Rauin, one replicatioun, Syne said thy reson is nocht worth ane myte. As I sall preue, with protestatioun That no man tak, my wordis in despyte, I say, the temporall Princis hes the wye That in the kirk, sic Pastouris dois prouyde, To gouerne saulis, yu not thame selfis can gyde. Lang tyme efter the kirk tuke properte The Prelatis leuit in greit perfectioun, Vnthrall to riches, or Sensualite Vnder the holy Spreitis protectioun, Orderlie chosin be electioun. As Gregore, Ierome, Ambrose, and Augustyne, Benedict, Bernard, Clement, Cleit, and Lyne. Sic pacient Prelatis, enterit be the port Plesand the peple be predicatioun.
Now dyke lowparis, dois in the kirk resort Be Symonie, and supplicatioun Of Princis be thare presentatioun. So sillie Saulis, that bene Christis scheip Ar geuin to hungrie gormand wolfis to keip. No maruell is, thocht we Religious men Degenerit be, and in our lyfe confusit. Bot sing, and drink, none vther craft we ken, Our spirituall Fatheris, hes vs so abusit Agane our wyll, those trukouris bene intrusit. Lawit men hes now, religious men in curis Profest Virginis, in keiping of strong huris. Princis, princis quhair bene ʒour hich prudens, In dispositioun of ʒour Beneficeis? The guerdonyng of ʒour Courticiens, Is sum cause of thir greit Enormiteis, Thare is one sort, waitand lyke hungrie fleis. For spirituall cure, thocht thay be no thing abill, Quhose gredie thristis bene Insatiabill. Princis, I pray ʒow be no more abusit, To verteous men hauyng so small regard? Quhy sulde vertew, throuch flatterie be refusit That men for couunyng, can get no reward? Allace that euer one bragger, or ane baird, Ane hure maister, or commoun hasarture, Suld in the kirk, get ony kynd of cure. War I one man, worthy to weir ane croun, Ay quhen thare vaikit ony beneficeis,
I suld gar call, ane Congregatioun The principall, of all the Prelaceis, Most cunnyng Clerkis of Vniuersiteis, Most famous Fatheris of religioun, With thare aduyse mak dispositioun. ❧ I sulde dispone, all offices Pastorallis, Tyll Doctours of Diuinite, or Iure. And cause dame Vertew, pull vp all hir saillis, Quhen cunnyng men had in the kirk most cure. Gar Lordis send thare Sonnis I ʒow assure To seik science, and famous sculis frequent Syne thame promoue, that war most sapient. Greit plesour war to heir ane Bischop preiche, One Dane, or Doctour in Diuinite, One Abhor, quhilk could weil his Cōuent teiche, One Persoun, flowing in Philosophie.

As for thare precheing, quod the Papingo I thame excuse, for quhy, thay bene so thrall To properte, and hir ding Dochteris two, Dame Riches, and fair lady Sensuall, Thay may nocht vse no pastyme spirituall. And in thare habitis, thay tak sic delyte, Thay haue renuncit russet, and roploch quhyte Cleikand to thame skarlot, and Cramosie, With Meneuer, martrik, Grice, & ryche armyne Thare lawe hartis, exalti ar so hie
To se thare Papale pompe it is ane pyne. More riche array is now with frenʒeis fyne, Vpon the barding of ane Bischopis Mule, Nor euer had Paule or Peter agane ʒule. Syne fair ladyis, thare Chene may not eschaip, Dame Sensuall so, sic seid hes in thame sawin. Les skaith it war with licence of the Paip, That ilk Prelate one Wyfe had of his awin, Nor se thare bastard{is} ouirthort ye cuntre blawin. For now be thay, be weil cūmin from the sculis, Thay fal to work, as thay war commoun bullis. PEw quod the gled, thow preichis all in vane. Ʒe Secular folkis, hes of our cace no curis. I grant said scho, ʒit men wyll speik agane, Quhow ʒe haif maid a hundreth thousand huris Quhilk{is} neuer had bene, war not ʒour lecherus luris And geue I lee, hartlie I me repent, Was neuer Bird I wat more penitent. Than scho hir schaue wt deuote countenance, To that fals gled, quhilk fenʒeit hym one freir. And quhen scho had fulfyllit hir pennance Full subtellie at hir he gan inqueir: Cheis ʒow (said he) quhilk of vs brether heir Sall haue of all ʒour naturall geir the curis, Ʒe knaw none bene, more holy creaturis. I am content (quod the pure Papingo) That ʒe freir Gled, and corbie monk ʒour brother Haue cure of all my gudis, and no mo. Sen at this tyme, freindschip I find none vther.
We salbe to ʒow trew as tyll our Mother (Quod thay) and sweir tyll fulfyll hir intent. Of that (said scho) I tak ane Instrument. The Pyot said, quhat sall myne office be? Ouerman said scho, vnto the vther two, The rowpand Rauin, said sweit sister lat se Ʒour holy intent for it is tyme to go. The gredie gled said, brother do nocht so We wyll remane, and haldin vp hir heid, And neuer depart frome hir, tyll scho be deid. The Papingo, thame thankit tenderlie, And said, sen ʒe haue tane on ʒow this cure, Depart myne naturall gudis equallie, That euer I had, or hes of dame Nature. First to the Howlet, Indigent and pure Quhilk on the day for schame dar nocht be sene, Tyll hir I leif, my gay galbert of grene.

Of naturall sicht, scho bene so Impotent, My birneist beik, I leif with gude entent Onto to the gentill, pieteous Pellicane, To helpe to pers, hir tender hart in twane. I leif the Goik, quhilk hes no sang bot one, My musike, with my voce Angelicall. And to the Guse, ʒe geue quhen I am gone, My Eloquence, anb toung Rethoria. And tak and dry, my bonis greit and small

To birne with hir, quhen scho hir lyfe renewis, In Arabie, ʒe sall hir find but weir, And sall knaw hir, be hir most heuinlie hewis, Gold, Asure, Gowles, Purpour, and Synopeie, Hir dait is for to leif fyue houndreth ʒeir. Mak to that bird my commendatioun. And als I mak ʒow supplicatioun, Sen of my corps, I haue ʒow geuin the cure. Ʒe speid ʒow to the court but tarying, And tak my hart of perfyte portrature, And it present vnto my Souerane King. I wat he wyll it clois it to one ring, Commend me to his grace, I ʒow exhort, And of my passioun mak hym trew report. Ʒe thre my tryppis sall haue for ʒour trauell, With luffer and lowng, to part equall amāg ʒow Pray and Pluto, the potent prince of hell Geue ʒe failʒe, that in his feit he fang ʒow, Be to me trew, thocht I no thing belang ʒow, Sore I suspect, ʒour conscience be to large. Dout nocht said thay, we tak it with the charge. Adew brether, quod the pure Papingo, To talkin more, I haue no tyme to tarie. Bot sen my spreit, mon fra my body go, I recommend it to the quene of Farie Eternallie, in tyll hir court to tarie In wyldernes, among the holtis hore. Than scho inclynit hir heid, and spak no more.
Plungit in tyll hir mortall passioun, Full greuouslie, scho grippit to the ground. It war to lang to mak narratioun Of sichis sore, with mony stang and stound, Out of hir wound, the blude did so abound, One coumpas round, was wt hir blude maid reid Without remeid, thare was no thing bot deid. ¶ And be scho had, In Mauus tuas said, Extinctit wer hir naturall wittis fyue. Hir heid full softlie on hir schulder laid Syne ʒeild the spreit, with panis pungityue. The Rauin began, rudely to rug and ryue, Full gormoundlyke, his emptie throt to feid, Eit softlie brother said the gredie gled. Quhil scho is hote, depart hir ewin amang vs. Tak thow one half, and reik to me ane vther, In tyll our richt, I wat no wicht dar wrang vs, The Pyot said, the feind resaue the fother, Quhy mak ʒe me stepbarne, and I ʒour brother? Ʒe do me wrang schir gled, I schrew ʒour hart Tak thare (said he) the puddingis for thy part. Than wit ʒe weill, my hart wes wounder sair For to behald, that dolent departing. Hir Angell fedderis, fleing in the air, Except the hart, was left of hir no thing. The Pyot said, this pertenith to the king. Quhilk tyll his grace, I purpose to present, Thow (quod the gled) sall faill of thyne intent.
The Rauin said, God nor I rax in ane raip. And thow get this, tyll other King or Duke. The Pyote said, plene I nocht to the Pape Than in ane smedie, I be smorit with smuke, With that the Gled, the pece claucht in his cluke, And fled his way, the laue with all thare micht To chace the gled, flew all out of my sicht. Now haue ʒe hard, this lytle Tragedie. The sore complaynt, the testament & mischance Of this pure Bird, quhilk did ascend so hie.

With hart and hand my mynd I sall addres, As I best can, and most compendious. Now I begyn, the mater hapnit thus. ☞ THE PROLOG. IN the Calendis of Ianuarie, Quhen fresche Phebus be mouyng circulai Frome Capricorne, wes enterit in Aquarie, With blastis that the branchis maid full bair. The snaw, and sleit, pertubit all the air, And flemit Flora, frome euery bank and bus Throuch support of the austeir Eolus. Efter that I the lang wynteris nicht. Had lyne walking, in my bed allone, Throuch heuy thocht, that no way sleip I micht, Remembryng of diuers thyngis goue. So vp I rose, and cleithit me anone. Be this fair Titan, with his lemis licht Ouer all the land, had spred his baner bricht.
With clok and hude, I dressit me belyue With dowbyl schone, & myttanis on my handis, Howbeit the air, wes rycht penettraryue, Ʒit fure I furth, lansing ouirthort the landis, Towart the see, to schort me on the sandis Because vnblomit was baith bank and bray. And so as I was passing be the way, I met dame Flora, in dule weid dissagysit. Quhilk in to May, wes dulce and delectabill With stalwart stormis, hir sweitnes wes supprisit Hir heuinlie hewis, war turait in to sabill, Quhilk{is} vinquhyle war to Luffaris amiabill, Fled frome the frost, the tender flouris I saw, Vnder dame Naturis mantill lurking law. The small fowlis, in flokkis saw I fle, To Nature makand greit lamentatioun. Thay lychtit doun, besyde me on ane tre, Of thare complaynt, I had compassioun, And with ane pieteous exclamatioun, Thay said blissit be Somer, with his flouris, And waryit be thow wynter, with thy schouris. Allace Aurora, the syllie Lark can cry, Quhare hes thou left, thy balmy liquour sweit That vs reiosit, we mounting in the sky? Thy syluer droppis, ar turnit in to sleir. O fair Phebus, quhare is thy holsum hei Quhy tholis thow, thy heuinlie pleland face With mystie vapours to be obscurit allace?
Quhar art thou May, wt Iune, thy sister schene, Weill bordourit with dasyis of delyte? And gentill Iulie, with thy mantill grene Enamilit with Rosis, reid and quhyte? Now auld and cauld Ianuar in despyte, Reiffis frome vs, all pastyme and plesure. Allace quhat gentil hart may this Indure? Ouersylit ar with cloudis odious The goldin skyis of the Orient. Chāging in sorrow, our sang melodious, Quhilk we had wount to sing with gude intent, Resoundand to the heuinnis firmament. Bot now our day, is changit in to nicht With that thay rais, & flew furth of my sicht. ❧Pensyue in hart, passing full soberly Vnto the see, fordwart I fure anone. The see was furth, the sand wes smoith & dry Than vp and doun, I musit myne alone Tyll that I spyit, ane lytle Caue of stone Hich in ane craig, vpwart I did approche But carying and clam vp in the Roche. And purposit, for passing of the tyme, Me to defend frome Ociosite, With pen and paper to Register in ryme Sum mery mater of Antiquite. Bot Idelnes, ground of iniquite Scho maid so dull my spreitis me within, That I wist nocht, at quhat end to begin.
Bot sal styll in that coue, quhare I mycht se The weltering of the wallis vp and doun, And this fals warldis Instabilite Vnto that se, makand comparisoun, And of this warldis wrechit variatioun To thame that fixis, all thare hole intent Considering quho most had, suld most repent. So with my hude, my heid I happit warme, And in my cloke, I fauldit beit my feir. I thocht my corps, with cauld suld tak no harme My mittanis held my handis weill in heit. The skowland craig, me couerit frome the sleit. Thare styll I sat, my bonis for to rest Tyll Morpheus with sleip my spreit opprest. So throw the bousteous blastis of Eolus, And throw my walking, on the nicht before, And throuch the seyis mouyng maruellous Be Neptunus, with mony rout and rore. Constraynit I was to sleip withouttin more. And quhat I dremit in conclusioun, I sall ʒow tell ane meruellous visioun, THE DREME OF SCHIR DAVID LYNDESAY. ME thocht ane lady of portratour perfyte Did salus me, wt benyng countenance, And I quhilk of hir presens had delyte Tyll hir agane maid humyll reuerence, And hir demandit, sauing hir plesance,
Quhat wes hir name? scho answerit courtesly, Dame Remembrance (scho said) callit am I. Quhilk cummin is for pastyme and plesour Of the, and for to beir the companie, Because I se thy spreit without mesour So sore perturbit be melancholie, Causing thy corps, to vaxin cauld and dry. Tharefor get vp, and gang anone with me. So war we boith, in twinkling of ane Ee, Doun throw the eird, in middis of the Center, Or euer I wist, in to the lawest hell, In to that cairfull Coue, quhen we did enter Ʒowting and ʒowling, we hard with mony ʒell. In flam of fyre, rycht furious and fell Was cry and mony cairfull Creature Blasphemand God, and warland Nature. Thare sawe we diuers Paipis and Empriouris, Without recouer mony cairfull kingis. Thare sawe we mony wrangous Cōquerouris, Withouttin richt, reiffaris of vtheris ringis, The men of kirk, lay boundin in to bingis, Thare saw we mony cairfull Cardinall, And Archebischopis in thare pontificall. Proud and peruerst Prelatt{is}, out of nummer, Priouris, Abbottis, and fals flatterand freiris. To specifie thame all, it wer ane cummer, Regulare chānonis, churle monk{is}, & chartereris, Curious Clerkis, and preistis seculeris.
Thare was sum part, of ilk Religioun In haiy kirk, quhilk did abusioun. Than I demand it dame Remembrance, The cause of thir Prelattis punitioun. Scho said the cause, of thare vnhappy chance. Was Couetyce, Lust, and ambteioun, The quhilk now garris thame want fruitioun Of God, and heir eternallie man dwell In to this painful poysonit pit of hell. Als thay did nocht instruct the Ignorent. Prouocand thame to penitence be preiching, Bot seruit warldlie Princis insolent, And war promouit, be thare fenʒen fleiching. Nocht for thare science, wisdome nor teicheing. Be Symonie, was thare promotioun, More for deneiris, nor for deuotioun. ☞ Ane vther cause of the punitioun, Of thir vnhappy prelattis Imprudent, Thay maid nocht equale distributioun Of haly kickis Patrimonie and rent, Bot temporallie, thay haue it all mispent. Quhilkis suld haue bene trypartit in to thre, First to vphauld the kick in honeste. The secund part, to sustene thare estaitis. The thrid part, to be geuin to the puris. Bot thay dispone that geir all vther gaitis, On cartis, and dyce, an harlotrie, and huris. Thir caryuis tuke no compt of thare a win curi
Thare kirkis reuin, thare loris clenely cled And richelie rewlit oi at bu and bed. Thare bastard barnis, proudely thay prouydit. The kirk geir largelie, thay did on tha spend In thare defaltis, thare subtis wee misgydit, And comptit nocht thare God, for tyll offend, Quhilk gart thaim want grace at tr letter end Rewland that rout I saw to Caps of Bras, Symon Magus, and Bischop Cayphas. Bischop Annas, and the tratour Iudas, Machomete, that Propheit poysonabill, Chore Dathan, and Airon thare was, Heretykis we saw vnnumeabill. It was ane sicht, richt wounderous aminabill Quhow that thay lay, in to thay  Neiting, With cairfull cryis, grening and greiting. Religious men wer punischit paefullit, For vaine glorie als for Inobedience, Brekand thare constitutionis wylfullie Nocht hauand thare Ouermen in reuerence, To knaw thare rewll thay maid no diligence, Vnleifsumlie, thay vsit properte, Passing the boundis of wilfull pouerte. Full sore weping, with vocis lamentbill, Thay cryit lawd, O Empriour Constantyne We may wyt thy possessioun personabill Of all our greit pame . Quhow t thy purpose was, till ane udefyne, Thw baneift frome vs,  deuotioun, Haiffand sic Ee tyll our promoioun.
Than we beheld ane den full dolorous, Quhare that Princis and Lordis temporall War Cruciate with panis rigorous. Bot to expreme thare panis in speciall. It dois exceid all my memoriall. Importabill pane thay had but conforting. Thare blude royall, maid thame no supporting. Sum catyue kingis, for cruell oppressioun. And vther sum, for thare wrangous conquest War condampnit, thay and thare Successioun, Sum for publict adulterie, and incest. Sum leit thare peple neuer leif in rest, Delyting so in plesour sensuall, Quhare for thare pane, was thare perpetuall Thare was the cursit Empriour Nero, Of euerilk vice the horribill veschell. Thare was Pharao, with diuers Princis mo, Oppressouris of the barnis of Israel. Herod, and mony mo, than I can tell. Ponce Pylat was thare hangit be the hals, With vniust Iugis, for thare sentence fals. Dukis, Marquessis, Erlis, Barronis, knichtis, With thay Princis, wer punist panefully. Participant thay wer of thare vnrichtis. Fordwart we went, and leit thir Lordis ly, And saw quhare Ladyis lamentabilly, Lyke wod Lyonis wer cairfullie cryand, In flam of fyre, richt furiouslie fryand.
Emprices, Quenis, and ladyis of honouris, Mony Duches, and Comptes, full of cair. Thay persit myne hart, thay tender Creaturis So pynit in that pit full of dispair Plungit in pane, with mony reuthfull rair. Sum for thare pryde, sum for Adulterie, Sum for thare tyisting men to Lecherie, Sum had bene cruell and malicious, Sum for making of wrangous heritouris. For to rehers thare lyffis vitious It wer bot tarie to the auditouris, Of Letherie, thay wer the verray uris With thare prouocatyue Impudictte Brocht mony ane man to Infelicite. Sum wemen for thare pusillanimiteQuhat horibill torment of consci∣ence wes this anti¦culate cō¦fessioun. Ouerset wt schame, thay did thame nev{er} schryue Of secreit Synnis, done in quiete And sum repentit neuer in thare lyue. Quharefor but reuth thai ruffeis did yaim ryue Rigorouslie without compassioun, Greit was thare dule, and lamentatioun. That we wer maid, thay cryit oft allace, Thus Tormentit with panis Intollerabill We mendit nocht, quhē we had tyme and space, Bot tuke in eid our lustis delectabill. Quharefor with feindis vgly and hortibill We ar condampnit, for euer more allace, Eternallie, withouttin hope of grace.
Quhare is the meit, and drink delicious, With quhilk we fed, our cairfull carionis? Gold, syluer, sylk, with perlis precious, Our ryches, rentis and our possessionis? Withouttin hope of our remissionis, Allace our panis ar Insufferabill, And our tormentis to compt Innumerabill. Than we beheld, quhare mony ane thousand. Commoun peple lay flichterand in the fyre, Of euerilk stait, thare was ane bailfull band. Thare mycht be sene, mony sorrowful Syre. Sum for Inuy sufferit, and sum for Ire, And sum for laik of restitutioun, Of wrangous geir without remissioun. Manesworne m̄chand{is}, for yair wrangous winning, Hurdaris of gold, & cōmoun Okkararis Fals men of Law, in Cautelis rycht cunning, Theiffis, reuaris, and publict oppressaris. Sum part thare was of vnleill Lauboraris Craftismen thare saw we out of nummer, Of ilk stait to declair, it wer ane cummer. And als langsum to me, for tyll Indyte, Of this presoun, the pams in speciall.

That mirk Mansioun, is tapessit with stink Thay se na thing, bot horribill visionis Thay heir bot scorne, and derisionis Of foule feindis, and blasphemationis. Thare feilling is Importabill passionis. For melodie, miserable murning. Thare is na solace, bet dolour Infinyte In bailfull beddis, bitterlie burning. With sobbing, siching, sorrow and with syte Thare conscience, thare hattis so did byte, To heir thame flyte, it was ane cace of cair, So in dispyte plungit in to despair. A lytle aboue, that dolorous doungeoun.He semis earn ¦clude thā allo Purgato¦rie. We enterit in, ane countre full of cait. Quhate that we saw, mony ane legioun Grerand and gowland, with mony refull rair. Quhat place is this (quod I) of blis so bait, Scho answerit (and said) Purgatorie Quhilk purgis Saulis, or thay cum to glorie. ¶ I se no plesour heir bot mekle paine. Quharefor (said I) leif we this sort in thrall. I purpose neuer, to cum beie againe. Bot ʒit I do beleue, and euer sall That the trew kirk, can no way erre at all, Sic thing to be, greit Clerkis dois conclude. Quhoweit my hope, stādis most in Christis blud.
Abufe that, in the thrid presoun anone. We enterit in ane place of perditioun, Quhare mony babbis war makand drery mone, Because thay wantit the fruitioun ic wes ye ignorāce of yaida∣is, ye mē ewin of scharpest iugemēr, culd not espy all abusis.Of God, quhilk was ane greit punitioun Of Baptisme, thay wantit the Ansenʒe. Vp wart we went, and left that mirthles menʒe. In tyll ane Volt, aboue that place of pane. Vnto the quhilk, but sudgeorne we ascendit, That was the Lymb, in the quhilk did remane Our forefatheris, because Adam offendit Eiland the fruct, the quhilk was defendit Mony ane ʒeir, thay dwelt in that Doungeoun In mirknes, and in delolatioun. Than throuch the erth, of nature cauld and dry. Glaid to eschaip, those places perrilous, We haistit vs, rycht wounder spedily. Ʒit we beheld, the Secretis maruellous The Mynis of gold, and stonis precious Of syluer, and of euerilk fyne mettell, Quhilk to declare, it wer ouer lang to dwell. Vp throuch the watter, schortlie we Intendi Quhilk enuironis the erth, withouttin dout.

Syne schortlie vpwart, throw the fyre we went, Quhilk wes the hiest, and hotest Element.
Quhen we had all, thir Elementis ouer pas. That is to say, erth, watter, air, and fyre, Vp wart we went, withouttin ony rest To se the Heuinnis, was out maist desyre. Bot or we mycht wyn, to the heuin Empyre It behuffit vs to pas, the way full ewin, Vp throuch the spheiris, of the Planeris sewin. First to the Mone, and vesyit all hir spheir. Quene of the see, and bewtie of the nycht, Of nature wak, and cauld, and no thyng cleir, For of hir self, scho hes none vther lycht Bot the reflex, of Phebus bemis brycht. The twelf signis, scho passis round about, In aucht and twenty dayes withouttin dout. Than we ascendit to Mercurious. Quhilk Poetis callis god of Eloquence, Rycht Doctourlyke, with termes delicious, In art expert, and full of Sapience. It wes plesour to pans on his prudence. Payntouris, Poeitis ar subiect to his cure, And hote, and dry, he is of his Nature. And als as cunning Astrologis sayis, He dois compleit his cours Naturallie, In thre houndreth, and aucht and thretty dayis. Syne vpwart we ascendit haistelie To fair Venus, quhare scho richt lustelie, Wes set in to ane sait, of syluer schene, That fresche Goddes, that lustie luffis quene.
Thy persit myne hart, hir blenkis amorous Quhowbeit that sumtyme scho is chengeable, With countenance and cheir full dolorous Quhylūmis richt plesand, glaid and delectable, Sumtyme constant, and sumtyme variable. Ʒit hir bewtie, resplendent as the fyre, Swagis the wraith of Mars, that god of Ire. This plesand Planeit, geue I can richt discriue, Scho is baith hote, and wak, of hir nature That is the cause, scho is prouocatiue Tyll all thame that ar subiectit to hir cure, To Venus werkis, tyll that thay may indure. Als scho completis, hir coursis natural, In twelf Monethis, withouttin ony fall. Than past we to the spheir of Phebus bricht, That lusty lamp, and lanterne of the heuin, And glaider of the sterris with his licht And principall of all the planeitis sewin, And sat in myddis of thame all full ewin, As Roy royal, rolling in his spheir, Full plesandlie in to his goldin Chair. Quhose Influence and vertew excellent, Geuis the lyfe tyll euerilk erthlie thing. That Prince of euerilk planeit precellent Dois foster flouris, and garris herbis spring, Throuch the cauld eirth, and causis birdis sing. And als his regular mouyng in the heuin.

☞ For to discryue his Diademe Royall, Bordourit about with stonis schyning bricht His goldin Cart, or throne Imperiall, The foure stedis, that drawis it full richt I leif to Poeitis, because I haue no slicht. Bot of his nature he is hote and dry, Compleitand in ane ʒeir, his cours trewly. Than vp to Mars, in by we haistit vs, Wounder hote, and dryer than the tounder, His face flamand, as syre richt furious, His host & brag, more aufull than the thounder, Maid all ye heuin, most lyke to schaik in schouder Quha wald behald his countenance and feir, Mycht cail hym weill, the god of men of weir. With colour reid, and luke malicious, Rycht colerick of his complexioun. Austeir, angrie, sweir, and seditious, Principall cause of the destructioun Of mony gude and obill Regioun. War nocht Venus, his Ire dois mitigate, This warld of pece wald be full desolate. This god of greif withouttin sudgeorning In ʒeris twa, his cours he doith compleit, Than past we vp, quhar Iuppiter the king Sat in his spheir, richt amiabill and sweit, Complexionat with waknes, and with heit. That plesand Prince, tair, dulce, and delicate Prouokis pece, and banissis debait.
The auld Poeitis, be superstitioun. Held Iuppiter, the Father principall Of all thare goddis in conclusioun, For his prerogatyuis in speciall Als be his vertew in to generall To auld Saturne, he makis resistance Quhen in his malice he wald wirk vengeance. This Iuppiter withouttin sudgeorning Passis throw all the twelf planeitis full euin, In ʒeris twelf, and than but carying We past vnto the hiest of the seuin, Tyll Saturnus, quhilk trublis all the heuin With heuy cheir, and collour paill as leid, In hym we saw bot dolour to the deid. And cauld, and dry, he is of his nature, Foule lyke ane Oule, of euill conditioun. Rycht vnplesand he is of portrature. His Intoxicate dispositioun It puttis all thing to perditioun Ground of seiknes, and melancholious. Peruerst and pure, baith fals and Inuyous. His qualite, I can nocht loue bot lack, As for his mouyng naturallie but weir, About the signis of the Zodiack, He dois compleit his cours, in thretty ʒeir. And so we left hym in his frosty spheir, Vp wart we did ascend Incontinent But est, tyll we come to the Firmament,
The quhilk was fixit ful of sterris bricht Of figour round, richt plesand and perfyte Quhose influence, and richt excellent licht, And quhose nummer, may nocht be put in wryte. Ʒit cunnyng Clerkis, dois naturallie indyte, How that he dois, compleit his cours but weir, In space of seuin and thretty thousand ʒeir. Than the nynt Spheir, and mouair principall Of all the laif, we wesy it all that heuin, Quhose daylie motioun is continuall, Baith firmament, and all the plancitis seuin, Frome eist, to west, garris thame full euin In to the space of four and twenty ʒeris Ʒit be the myndis of the Astronomeris, The seuin Planeitis, in to thare proper spheiris, Frome west to eist, thay moue naturallie.

Than moutit we, with richt feruent desyre Vpthrow the heuin, callit Christallyne And so we enterit in the heuin Empyre, Quhilk to discryue, it passis myne Iagyne. Quhat God in to his holy throne druyne Regnis in to his glore Inestimabill With Angellis citir, quhilkis ar Innumerabill.
In Ordeuris nyne, thir spreitis glorious Ar deuydit, the quhilkis excellentlie Makis louyng, with sound melodious, Singand Sanctus, tycht wounder feruentlie, Thir ordeuris nyne, thay at full plesandlie Deuydit in to Hierarchies thre, And thre Ordouris in euerilk Hierarchie. The lawest Ordour, is of Angellis bricht, As Messingeris send to this law Regioun. The secund ordour, Archangellis full of micht. Virtues, Potestatis Principatis of renoun. The sext is callit Dominatioun. The seuint Thronus, the auchtin Cherubin. The nynt and hiest, callit Seraphin. ☞ And nixt vnto the blissit Trinite, In his Tryumphant throne Imperiall, Thre in tyll one, and one substance in tyre, Quhose indiuisibill essence eternall, The rude Ingyne, of mankynd is to small Tyll comprehend, quhose power Infinyte, And deuyne nature, no Creature can wryte. So myne Ingyne, is nocht sufficient For to treit, of his hich Diuinite. All mortall men at Insufficient Tyll considder thay thre in vnite, Sic subtell mater I man on neid lat be To study on my Creid, it wat full fair, And lat Doctouris of sic hic materis declair.
Than we beheld the blissit Humanite Of Christ, sittand in to his Sege Royall At the rycht hand of the Diuinite With ane excelland court Celestiall, Quhose exercitioun continuall Was in louyng thair Prince, with reuerence, And on this wyse thay kepit ordinance. Nixt to the Throne, we saw ye Quene of quenis Weil cumpanyit, with Ladyis of delyte Sweit was the sang, of those blissit Virginnis, No mortall man, thare solace may indyte. The Angellis bricht, in nummer infinyte, Gerilk Ordour in thare awin degre War officiaris vnto the deite. Patriarkis, and Propheitis honorabill, Coilaterall counsalouris in his consistorie, Euangelistis, Apostolis venerabill War Capitanis vnto the King of Glorie, Quhilk Chitanely e had wyn the Victorie, Of that tryumphand Court celestiall Sanct Peter was Lufetenand generall.

And last we saw infinyte multitude Makand seruice vnto his Celsitude.
Quhilkis be the hie Deuyne permissioun, Felicite thay had Inuariable, And of his Godheid, cleir cognitioun, And compleit peice thay had Interminable. Thare glore, and honour, was Inseparable. That plesand place repleit of pulchritude Vnmesurable it was of magnitude. Thare is plentie of all plesouris perfyte, Euydent brichtnes, but obscurite. Withouttin dolour, dulcore, and delyte. Withouttin rancour, perfyte Cherite. Withouttin hounger, Satiabilite. O happy ar the Saulis predestinate, Quhen Saule and body salbe glorificate. Thir maruellous mirthis for to declair, Be Arithmetik, thay at Innumerable. The portratour of that place preclair, By Geometrie, it is Inmesurable, By Rethorik als Inpronunciable. Thare is none eiris may heir, nor Eine my se, Nor hart may thynk this thare felicite. Quhare to sulde I presume for tyll indyte, The quhilk Sanct Paule, that Doctour sapient Can nocht expres nor in to paper wryte The hie excellent work Indeficient, And perfyte plesour euer permanent, In presence of that mychtie King of glore, Quhilk was, and is, and sall be euer more.
At Remembrance, humillie I did inquyre Geue I mycht in that plesour styll remane. (Scho said) aganis resoun is thy desyre Mhrefore my freind, thou mon returne agane Ito the warld, quhair thow sall suffer pane, d thole the dede with cruell panis sore, Or thow be digne, to regne with hym in glore. Than we returnit sore aganis my wyll, Doun throw spheiris of the heuinnis cleir. Hir commandement behustit I fulfyll With sorte hart, wit ʒe withouttin weir. I wald full faine haif taryit thare all ʒeir Bot scho said to me, thare is no remeid, Or thow remane heir, first thow mon be deid. Quod I, I pray ʒow hartfullie madame, Sen we haue had sic Contemplatioun Of heuinlie plesouris, ʒit or we pas hame Lat vs haue sum consideratioun Of eirth, and of his Situatioun. Scho answerit and said, that sall be done. So wer we botth, brocht in the air full sone. Quhare we mycht se the Erth all at one sicht, Bot lyke one moit, as it apperit to me, In the respect of the heuinnis bricht. I haue maruell (quod I) quhow this may be, The erth semis of so small quantite The leist sterne fixit in the Firmament Is more than all the erth, be my Iugement.
Scho sayis Sone, thow hes schawin ye verite, The smallest sterne fixit in the firmament, In deid it is of greiter quantite Than all the eirth, efter the intent Of wyse, and cunning Clerkis sapient. Quhat quantite is than the eirth (quod I) That sall I schaw (quod scho) to the schortly. Efter the myndis of the Astronomouris, And speciallie, the Auctour of the Spheir, And vther diuers greit Philosophouris, The quantite of the erth Circuleir, Is fiftie thousand liggis, withouttin weir, Seuin houndreth, and fiftie, and no o, Deuiding ay ane lig, in mylis two.

The diuisioun of the Eirth. THen certanlie scho tuke me be the hand, And said my sone cū on thy wayis wt me And so scho gart me cleirly vnderstand How that the erth, tripartit wes in thre: In Aphrik, Europe, and Asie. Efter the myndis of the Cosmographouris That is to say, the warldis Descriptouris. First Asia, contenit is in the Orient, And is weill more, than baith the vther twane, Aphrik, and Europe, in the Occident, And ar deuydit be ane sey certane, And that is callit, the see Mediterrane, Quhilk at the strait of Marrok hes entre, That is betuix Spanʒe, and Barbarie. Towart the southwest lyis Aphrica, And in the northwest, Europa doith stand. And all the eist, contenis Asia. On this wyse, is deuydit the serme land It war mekle to me to tak on hand Thir Regionis, to declair in speciall, Ʒit sall I schaw thair Names in generall.

In litle Asia, standis Galathie, Pamphilia, Isauria, and Leid, Rhegia, Arethusa, Assyria, and Meid. ☞Secundlie, we considderit Africa, With mony fructfull famous regioun As Ethiopie, and Tripolitana, Zewges, quhare standis the triumphant toun Of nobyll Carthage, that Ciete of renoun. Garamantes, Nadabar, Libia, Getulia, and Mauritania. Fezensis, Numidie, and Thingitane, Of Affrick, thir ar the principall. Than Europe, we considderit in certane, Quhose Regionis, schortlie rehers I sall. Four principallis, I find aboue thame all Quhilk{is} ar Spanʒe, Italie, and France, Quhose Subregionis, wer mekle tyll auance.

In Spanʒe, lyis Castillie and Arragone. Nauarne, Galice, Portugall, and Granate, Than saw we famous Ilis mony one Quhilkis in the Occeane sey, was situate. Thame to discryue, my wyt wes desolate. Of Cosmographie I am nocht expare, For I did neuer study in that art. Ʒit I sall sum of thare names declare, As Madagascar, Gades, and Taprobane, And vther diuers Ilis gude and fair Situate in to the scy Mediterrane, As Cyper, Candie, Corsica, and Sardane.

Quho wald at lenth, heir the Descriptioun Of euerilk Ile, als weill as the ferme land, And properteis, of euerilk Regioun, To study and to reid man tak on hand And the attentike werkis vnderstand Of Plinius, and worthy Ptholomie, Quhila{is} war expert in to Cosmographie. Thare sall thay fynd, the namis and properteis Of euery Ile, and of ilk Regioun. Than I inquirit of erthly Paradeis, Of the quhilk Adam, tynt Possessioun. Than schew scho me the Situatioun Of that precelland place of delyte, Quhose properteis wer lang for to Indyte. ☞ OF PARADICE. THis Paradice, of all plesouris reple, Situate I saw in to the Orient. That glorio{us} gairth of euery flouris did fleit The lusty lillyis, the rosis redolēt Fresche holesum fructis Indeficient, Baith herbe, and tre, thare growis euer grene, Throw vertew of the temperat air serene. The sweit holesum aromatike odouris, Proceiding frome the herbis Medicinall The heuinlie hewis of the fragrant flouris, It was ane sicht wounder celestiall. The perfectioun to schaw in speciall,
And Ioyis of that Regioun deuyne Of mankynd, it exceidis the Ingyne. ❧And als so hie in Situatioun, Surmounting the myd Regioun of the air, Quhare no maner of perturbatioun Of wedder may ascend so hie as thair. Four fludis flowing frome ane Fontane fair As Tigris, Ganges, Euphrates, and Nyle, Quhilk in the eist, Transcurtis mony ane myle. The countre closit is about full richt, With wallis hie, of hote and birnyng fyre, And straitly keipit be ane Angell bricht Sen the departyng of Adam, our Grand schyre, Quhilk throw his cryme Incurrit Goddis , And of that place tint the Possessioun, Baith frome hym self, and his Successioun. Quhen this lufesum lady Remembrance All this foresaid had gart me vnderstand, I prayit hir of hir beneuolence To schaw to me, the countre of Scotland. Well sone (scho said) that sal I tak on hand, So suddandlie, scho brocht me in certane, Euin Iust abone the braid Ile of Britane. Quhilk standis northwest in the Occeane see, And deuydit in famous Regionis two. The south part Ingland, ane full richt countre, Scotland be north, with mony Ilis mo. Be west Ingland, Ireland doith stand also. Quhose properteis, I wyll nocht tak on hand To schaw at lenth, bot onely of Scotland.
OF THE REALME OF SCOTLAND. QUhilk efter my sempyll Intendement, And as Remembrance did to me report, I fall declare the suith, and verrayment As I best can, and in to termes schort. Quhairfor effecteo uslie, I ʒow exhort, Quhowbeit my wrytting be nocht tyll auance, Ʒit quhare I faill, excuse myne Ignorance. Quhen that I had ouersene this Regioun, The quhilk of nature is boith gude and fair, I did propone, ane litle questioun Beseikand hir, the same for to declair. Quhat is the cause, our boundis bene o bair, (Quod I) or quhat dois moue our Misei, Or quhareof dois proceid our pouertie? For throw the support of ʒour hir prudence Of Scotland, I persaue the properteis. And als considderis be experience Of this countre the greit commoditeis. First the aboundance of fischis in our seis, And fructuall montanis for our bestiall, And for our cornis, mony lusty vaill. The riche Ryueris plesand and proffitabill, The lustie loichis, with fische of sindry kyndis, Hounting, halking, for nobillis conuenabill, Forrestis full of Da, Ra, Hartis, and Hyndis, The fresche fontanis, quhose holesū cristal strandis Refreschis so, the flurischit grene meidis. So laik we no thing that to nature neidis.
Of euerilk mettell, we haue the riche Mynis, Baith Gold, Syluer, and stonis precious. Howbeit we want the Spycis and the wynis. Or vther strange fructis delicious, We haue als gude, and more neidfull for vs, Meit, drink, fyre, claithis yar in ye be gart abound. Quhilk{is} ellis is nocht in all the Mapamound More faiter peple, nor of greiter ingyne Nor of more strenth, greit deidis tyll indure. Quharefor I pray ʒow, that ʒe wald detyne The principall cause, quharefor we at so pure, For I maruell greitlie, I ʒow assure, Considderand the peple, and the ground, That Riches suld nocht in this realme redound. My Sone (scho said) be my discretioun, I sall mak answeir, as I vnderstand. I say to the vnder confessioun, The falt is nocht, I dat weill tak on hand, Nother in to the peple nor the land. As for the land, it laikis na vther thing, Bot laubour, and the pepillis gouerning. Than quharein lyis our Inprosperite (Quod I) I pray ʒow hartfullie Madame Ʒe wald declair to me the verite. Or quho sall beir of our barrat the blame? For be my treuth to se, I think greit schame So plesand peple, and so fait ane land, And so few verteous deidis tane on hand.
Quod scho, I sall efter my Iugement, Declair sum causis, in to generall, And in to termes schort schaw myne intent, And syne transcend in to more speciall. So this is myne conclusioun finall. Wanting of Iustice, policie, and peace, At cause, of thir vnhappines allace. ☞It is difficill Riches tyll incres, Quhare Polycie makith no residence. And Policie may neuer haue entres, Bot quhare that Iustice dois diligence To puneis quhare thare may be found offence. Iustice may nocht haue Dominatioun, Bot quhare Pece makis habitatioun. Quhat is the cause, that wald I vnderstand. That we suld want Iustice, and policie, More than deis France, Italie, or Ingland Madame (quod I) schaw me the verite? Sen we haue lawis in this countre, Quhy want we lawis exercitioun Quho suld put Iustice tyll executioun. Quhare in dois stand our principall remeid, Or quha may mak a mendis of this mischeif? (Quod scho) I find the falt in to the heid, For thay in quhome dois ly our hole releif, I finde thame rute, and ground of all our greif. For quhen the heidis ar nocht diligent, The membris man on neid be negligent. So I conclude, the causis principall
Of all the trubill of this Natioun, Ar into Princis in to speciall, The quhilkis hes the Gubernatioun, And of the peple Dominatioun. Quhose contynewall exercitioun Sulde be in Iustice Executioun. For quhen the sleuthfull hird, dois sloug & sleip, Taking no cure, in keping of his flok Quho wyll go serche amang sic hirdis scheip, May able fynd mony pure scabbit crok, And goyng wyld at large withouttin lok. Than Lupus tūmis, and Lowrence in ane ling And dois but reuth, the sely scheip dounthring. Bot the gude hird, walkryfe and diligent Doith so, that all his flockis ar rewlit richt. To quhose quhissill all ar obedient And geue the wolfis cummis day or nicht Thame to deuore, than ar thay put to flicht, Houndit and slane, be thare weill dantit doggis, So ar thay sure, baith ʒowis, lambis, & hoggis. So I conclude, that throw the negligence Of our infatuate heidis Insolent, Is cause of all this realmes indigence, Quhilk{is} in Iustice, hes nocht bene diligent, Bot to gude counsall inobedient, Hauand small E, vnto the commoun weill Bot to thare singulare profite euerilk deill. For quhen thir Wolfis be oppressioun The pure peple but piete doith oppres,
Than suld the princis mak punitioun, And cause thay Rebaldis for to mak redres, That ryches micht be, and Policie incres. Bot richt difficill it is to mak remeid Quhn that the falt is so in to the heid. THE COMPLAYNT OF THE Comoun weill of Scotland. ANd thus as we wer talking to and fro, We saw a busted{us} berne cū ouir ye bent, But hors on fute, als fast as he micht go Quhose rayment wes all raggit rewin & vent With visage leyne, as he had fastit lent. And fordwart fast his wayis he did aduance, With ane richt melancholious countenance. With scrip on hip, and pyikstaff in his hand, As he had bene purposit, to pas sra hame. Quod I gude man, I wald faine vnderstand, Geue that ʒe pleist to wit quhat wer ʒour name. Quod he my sone, of that I think greit schame. Bot sen thow wald of my name haue ane feill, Forsuith thay call me Ihone the comoun weill. Schir Commoun weil, quho hes ʒow so disgysit (Quod I) or quhat makis ʒow so miserabill, I haue maruell, to se ʒow so supprysit, The quhilk that I haue sene so honorabill, To all the warld, ʒe haue bene proffitabill, And weill honorit in euerilk Natioun. How happinnis now ʒour tribulatioun?
Allace (quod he) thow seis how it dois stand With me, and quhow I am disheritsit Of all my grace, and inon pas of Scotland. And go afore, quhare I was cheriset. Remane I heir, I am bor perisit, For thare is few to me, that takis tent, That garris me go, so raggit, rewin, and rent. My tender feeindis ar all put to the flicht For Policie is fled agane in France, My Syster Iustice, almaist haith tynt hir sicht, That scho can nocht hald ewinly hir ballance. Plane wrang, is plane capitane of Ordinance, The quhilk debarres Laute, and resoun, And small remeid is found for oppin tresoun. In to the south allace I was neir slane. Ouer al the land I culd find no releif. Almoist betuix the Mers, and Lotchmabane, I culd noht knaw ane leill man be ane theif. To schaw thare reif, thift, murthour, & mischeif, And vicious workis it wald infect the air, And als langsum, to me for tyll declair. In to the hieland, I could find no remeid, Bot suddandlie, I wes put to exile, Thai sweir swyngeour{is} thay tuke of me nō heid, Nor amengis thame, lat me remane ane quhyle. Als in the out Ilis, and in Argyle, Vnthrift, sweirnes, falset, pouerte, and stryfe, Pat Policie in danger of hir lyfe.
In the law land, I come to seik refuge. And purposit thare to mak my residence. Bot singulare proffect, gart me sone disluge, And did me greit Iniuris, and offence. And said to me, swyith harlote hy the hence, And in this countre se thow tak no curis, So lang as my authorite induris. And now I may mak no langer debait, Nor I wat nocht, quhome to I suld me mene, For I haue socht throw all the Spirituall stait, Quhilk{is} tuke na compt for to heir me complene, Thare officiaris thay held me at disdane, For Symonie, he rewlis vp all that rout. And Couetice that Carl gart bar me out. Pryde haith chaist frome thame humilite, Deuotioun is fled vnto the freiris. Sensuall plesour hes baneist Chaistite, Lordis of Religioun, thay go lyke Seculeris, Taking more compt in telling thare deneris, Nor thay do of thare constitutioun. Thus ar thay blindit be ambitioun. Our gentill men ar all degenerate. Liberalite, and Lawte, boith ar lost. And Cowardice with Lordis is laureate, And knychtlie curage turnit in brag and boist. The Ciuill weir misgydis euerilk oist. Thare is nocht ellis, bot ilk man for hym self, That garris me go, thus baneist lyke ane elf. Tharefor adew, I may no langer tarie.
Fair weil (quod I) ād wt sanct Iohne to borrow. Bot wit ʒe weill, my hart was woundit sarie Quhen comoun weill so sopit was in sorrow, Ʒit efter the nicht, cūmis the glaid morrow. Quharefore I pray ʒow schaw me in certane, Quhen that ʒe purpose for to cum agane. That questioun it sall be sone decydit, (Quod he) thare sall na Scot haue conforting Of me, till that I see the countre gydit Be wysedome, of ane gude auld prudent king, Quhilk sall delyte hym maist aboue all thing, To put Iustice tyll executioun, And on strang tratouris mak punitioun. Als ʒit to the I say ane vther thing, I se rycht weill that prouerb is full trew, Wo to the realme, that hes ouir ʒoung ane king. With that he turnit his bak, and said adw. Ouer firth and fell, richt tast fra me he flew. Quhose departing to me was displesand. With that Remembrance tuk me be the hand. And sone me thocht scho brocht me to the roche, And to the Coue, quhare I began to sleip. With that one schip did spedilie approche, Full plesandlie sailling vpon the deip, And syne did slak hir saillis, and gan to creip Towart the land, anent quhare that I lay. Bot wit ʒe weill, I gat ane fellown fray. All hir Cannounis, sche leit crak attonis, Doun schuke the stremaris, frome ye topcastell.
Thay spairit nocht the poulder nor the stonis, Thai schot thair boutis, & doun yair ankers fell, The Marinaris, thay did so ʒout and ʒell, That haistelie I steit out of my dreme, Half in ane fray, and spedilie past hame. And lychtlie dynit, with list and appetyte. Syne efter past in tyll ane Oritore, And tuke my pen, and thare began to wryte All the visioun, that I haue schawin afore. Schir of my dreme, as now thow gettis no more, Bot I beseik God, for to send the grace, To rewle thy Realme in vnite, and peace. THE EXHORTATIOVN TO THE KINGIS GRACE. SChir sen that God of his preordinance, Haith grantit the, to haue the gouernance Of his peple, and create the one King, Faill nocht to prent in thy Remembrance That he wyll nocht excuse thyne Ignorance, Geue thow be rekles in thy gouerning. Quharefor dres the aboue all vther thing, Of his lawis to kep the obseruance, And thow schaip lang in Royaltie to ring. Thank hym, that hes commandit dame Nature, To prent the of so plesand portrature. Hir gyftis may be cleirly on the knawin. Tyll dame Fortune, thow neidis no procurature, For scho hes largelie, kyith on the hir cure.

And syne considder thy vocatioun, That for to haue the gubernatioun Of this kynrik, thow art predestinate, Thow may weill wit be trew narratioun, Quhat sorrow, and quhat tribulatioun Haith bene in this pure realme infortunate. Now conforte thame that hes bene desolate, And of thy peple haue compassioun, Sen thow be God, art so preordinate. Tak manlie curage, and leif thyne Insolence, And vse counsall of nobyll dame Prudence. Founde the fermelie on faith and fortitude, Draw to thy court, Iustice, and temperance. And to the Commoun weill haue attendance. And also I beseik thy Celsitude, Hait vicious men, and lufe thame that ar gude. And ilk flatterer thow fleme frome thy presence, And fals report out of thy court exclude. Do equall Iustice, boith to greit and small, And be exempill to thy peple all, Exercing verteous deidis honorabill. Be nocht ane wreche, for oucht that may befall, To that vnhappy vice and thow be thrall. Tyll all men thow sall be abhominabill. Kingis ar knichtis, ar neuer cōuanabill
To rewle peple, be thay nocht liberall, Was neuer ʒit na wreche to honoure abill.

Als I beseik thy Maieste serene, Frome Lecherie, thow keip thy body clene Taist neuer that Intoxicate poysoun Frome that vnhappy sensuall Syn abstene, Tyll that thow get ane lusty plesand Quene, Than tak thy plesour with my benisoun. Tak tent how prydful Tarquyne tynt his croun, For the deforsing of Lucrece the schene. And was depryuit, and banist Romes toun. And in despyit of his Lecherous leuing, The Romanis wald be subiect to no king. Mony lang ʒeir, as storyis doith record, Tyll Iulius, throw verteous gouerning, And Princelie curage, gan on thame to ring, And chosin of Romanis, Empriour, and lord. Quharfor my Souerane in to thy mynd remord, That vicious lyfe, makis oft ane euill ending, Without it be throw speciall grace restord.
And geue thow wald thy fame and honour grew, Vse counsall of thy prudent Lordis trew, And se thow nocht presumpteouslie pretend, Thy a win particular weill for tyll Ensew. Wirk with counsall, so sall thow neuer rew. Remember of thy Freindis the fatall end, Quhilkis to gude counsall wald not condiscend. Tyll bitter deith (allace) did thame persew. Frome sic vnhap I pray God the defend. And finallie, remember thow mon de And suddanlie pas of this mortall see, And art nocht sicker of thy lyfe two houris. Sen thare is none frome that sentence may flee. King, Quene, nor Knicht, of law estait nor hie, Bot all mon thole of deith, the bitter schouris. Quhar bene thay gone, thir papis & empriouris? Bene thay nocht dede, so sall it fair on the. Is no remeid, strenth, riches, nor honouris. And so for conclusioun, Mak our Prouisioun To get the infusioun Of his hie grace Quhilk bled with effusioun With scorne and derisioun. And deit with confusioun, Confirmand our peace. AMEN. FINIS.
The Complaint of Schir Dauid Lindesay, of the Mont Knicht, direct to the Kingis Grace. ☞ * ☜ SChir I beseik thyne Excellence, Heir my complaynt with pacience, My dolent hart dois me constrayne, Of my Infortune to complayne. Quhowbeit I stand in greit doutance, Quhome I sall wyte of my mischance. Quhidder Saturnis crucite Regnand in my Natiuite e bad aspect, quhilk wirkis vengeanre, Or vtheris heuinlie influence.

And enterit to thy Maieste The day of thy Natiue, Quharethrow my freindis bene eschamit, And with my fais I am defamit, Seand that I am nocht regardit Nor with my brether in Court rewardit, Blamand my slethfull negligence That seikis nocht sum recompence. Quhen diuers men dois me demand Quhy gettis thow nocht sunt pece of land,
Als weill as vther men hes gottin. Than wis I to be deid and rottin, With sic extreme discomforting That I can mak no answering. I wald sum wyse man did me teiche, Quhidder that I suld flatter or fleiche I wyll nocht flyte, that I conclude For crabing of thy Celsitude. And to flatter, I am defamit. Want I reward, than am I schamit. Bot I hope thow sall do als weill As did the Father of Fameill, Of quhome Christ makis mentioun Quhilk for ane certane pensioun Feit men to wirk in his wyne ʒaird. Bot quho come last, gat first rewaird. Quharethrow the first men wer displeisit. Bot he thame prudentlie ameisit. For thocht the last men, first wer seruit, Ʒit gat the first that day deseruit. So am I sure thy maieste, Sall anis reward me or I de, And rub the roust of my ingyne Quhilk bene for langour lyke to tyne. Althocht I beit nocht lyke ane baird Lang seruice ʒarnis ay rewaird.

Ane dum man ʒit wan neuer land. And in the court men gettis na thing Without inopportune asking. Allace my sleuth and schamefulnes Debarrit frame all gredines. Gredie men that ar diligent Rycht oft obtenis thare intent, And failʒeis nocht to conqueis landis, And namelie at ʒoung Princis handis. Bot I tuke neuer none vther cure.

Quhen men dois aske ocht at ane king, Sulde ask his grace ane nobill thing, To his Excellence honorabill, And to the asker proffitabill. Thocht I be in my asking lidder, I pray thy grace for to considder. Thow hes maid baith lordis and lairdis, And hes gewin mony riche rewairdis To thame that was full far to seik, Quhen I lay nychtlie be thy cheik. ¶I tak the Quenis grace thy mother.

And haistelie plat in his hand The gouernance of all Scotland.

For breid of rockis and foreland, To put the Ruther in his hand. Without Godds grace is no refuge. Geue thare be danger, ʒe may Iuge. I geue thame to the deuill of hell
Quhilk first deuysit that counsell. I wyll nocht say that it was tresoun, Bot I der sweir, it was no resoun.

For thow art bot ane Instrument To that greit King Omnipotent. So, quhen it plesis his excellence, Thy grace sall mak me recompence. Or he sall cause me stand content, Of quiet lyfe, and sober rent.

Quhilk I wald till all creature wer kend. ¶ I not said I, mak sic memoriall But of thy name I had Intelligence. I am Dauid, that cairfull Cardinall Quhilk doith appeir (said he) to thy presence. That vmquhyle had so greit preeminence. Than he began, his deidis tyll indyte As ʒe sall heir, and I began to wryte.
❧ I Dauid Betoun Vmquhyle Cardinall, Of nobill blude, be lyne I did discend, During my tyme I had no peregall. Bot now is cum, allace my fatall end. Ay gre, be gre vpwart I did ascend Swa that in to this realme did neuer ring So greit one man as I, vnder ane king Quhen I was ane ʒoung Ioly gentill man, Princis to serue, I set my hole intent. First tyll ascend, at Arbroith I began Ane Abbacie, of greit riches and rent. Of that estait, ʒit was I nocht content, To get more ryches, dignite, and glore, My hart was set, allace, allace, tharefore. I maid sic seruice tyll our Souerane king, He did Promoue me tyll more hie estate. One Prince abufe al preistis for til ring, Archebischop of Sanctandrois consecrate. Tyll that honour quhen I was Eleuate, My prydefull hart was nocht content at all, Tyll that I create wes ane Cardinall. Ʒit preissit I tyll haue more authorite. And finallie, was chosin Chancellair. And for vphalding of my dignite, Was maid Legate than had I no compair. I purchest for my proffect singulair, My Boris, and my Thresure tyll auance. The Bischoprik of Mecepois in France.
Of all Scotland, I had the Gouernall, But my a wyfe concludit wes no thing Abbot, Bischop, Archebischop, Cardinall, In to this Realme no hieat culd I ting, Bot I had bene Pape, Empriour, or King. For schortnes of the tyme, I am nocht abill At lenth to schaw, my actis honorabill. ¶For my most Princelie Prodigalite, Amang Prelatis in France I bure the pryse. I schew my Lordlie Liberalite, In Banketting, playing, at cartis and Dyse. In to sic wysedome, I was haldin wyse. And sparit nocht to play with king, nor knicht Thre thousand crownis of gold vpon ane nicht. In France, I maid seir honest Voyagis, Quhare I did Actis digne of Remembrance. Throuch me war maid Tryūphant Mariagis, Tyll our Souerane boith proffet and plesance. Quene Magdalene, the first Dochter of France, With greit ryches was in to Scotland brocht. That mariage throch my wisedom it was wrocht Efter quhose deith, in France I past agane, The secunde Quene, homewart I did conuoy. That lustie Princes, Marie de Lorane, Quhilk wes resauit with greit triumphe & Ioy. So seruit I our richt Redoutit Roy. Sone efter that, Harie of Ingland king Of our Souerane, desirit ane commoning.
Of that meting, our king wes weill content, So that in Ʒork, was set boith tyme and place. Bot our Prelatis, nor I, wald neuer consent, That he suld se, King Harie in the face, Bot we wer weill content, quhowbeit his grace Had saillit the sey, to speik with ony vther, Except yat king, quhilk was his mother brother. Quhait throch yar rose, greit weir & mortal stryfe Greit heirschip{is}, hunger, derth, and desolatioun. On ather syde, did mony lose thare lyfe, Geue I wald mak ane trew Narratioun, I causit all that tribulatioun. For tyll tak peace, I neuer wald consent, With our the king of france had bene content. Duryng this weir, wartaking presoneiris, Of nobyll men, fechting full furiouslie Mony one Lord, Barroun, and Bacheleiris, Quhar throuch our king tuk sic melancholie, Quhilk draue hym to the deid richt dulcfullie. Extreme Dolour ouirset did so his hart, That frome this lyfe, allace, he did depart. Bot efter that boith strenth & speiche wes leisit, Ane paper blank, his grace I gart subscryue, In to the quhilk, I wrait all that I pleisit, Efter his deith, quhilk lang war tyll descryue Throuch that writting, I purposit belyue, With support of sum Lordis beneuolence, In this Regioun till haue Preeminence.
As for my Lord, our richteous Gouernour, Geue I wald schortlie schaw the veritie, Till hym I had no maner of fauour, During that tyme, I purposit that he Suld neuer cum to none Auctorite. For his support tharefor he brocht amang vs, Furth of Ingland, the nobyll Erle of Angus. Than was I put abak frome my purpose, And suddandlie cast in Captiuite, My prydefull hatt to dant, as I suppose Deuysit be the hich Diuinite. Ʒit in my hart, sprang no humylite, Bot now the word of God full weill I knaw, Quho dois exalt hym self, God sall hym law. In the meine tyme, quhen I was so subiectit, Ambassadouris war sent in to Ingland. Quhare thay boith peice, and mariage cōtractit. And more surelie, for tyll obserue that band, War promist diuers plegis of Scotland. Of that contract, I wes no way content, Nor neuer wald thare to geue my consent. Tyll Capitanis, that keipit me in waird, Giftis of gold, I gaue thame greit plente Rewlatis of court, I richelie did reward, Quhare throuch I chaipit frome Captiuite. Bot quhen I was fre, at my liberte, Than lyke ane Lyon, lowsit of his Cage. Out throuch this realme, I gan to reil and rage.
Contrar the Gouernour, and his companie, Oft tymes maid I insurrectioun. Purposing for till haue hym haistelie. Subdewit vnto my correctioun. Or put hym tyll extreme subiectioun. Duryng this tyme, geue it war weill decydit, This realme be me was vtterlie deuydit. The Gouernour purposing to subdew, I rasit ane oist of mony bald Barroun, And maid ane raid, quhilk Lithgow ʒit may rew, For we destroyit ane myle about the town. For that I gat mony blak malisoun. Ʒit contrair the Gouernouris intent. With our ʒōng Princes, we to Striuiling went. For hich contemptioun of the Gouernour, I brocht the Erle of Lennox, furth of France. That lustie Lord, leuand in greit plesour, Did lose that land and honest Ordinance. Bot he and I, fell sone at variance. And throch my counsall, was within schort space, For faltit and flemit, he gat none vther grace. Than throuch my prudence, practik and ingyne, Our Gouernour I causit to consent Full quyetlie, to my counsall inclyne. Quhare of his Nobilis, war nocht weil content. For quhy, I gurt dissolue in plane Parliament, The band of peite, contractit with Ingland. Quharthroch ce harme, & heirschip to scotlād.
That pece brokin, arois new mortall weiris, Be sey, and land, sic reif, without releif, Quhilk to report, my frayit hart effeiris, The verite to schaw in termis breif, I was the rute, of all that greit mischeif. The south countre may say, it had bene gude, That my Nurice, had smorit me in my cude. I wes the cause of mekle more mischance For vphald, of my glore, and dignite, And plesour of the potent King of france, With Ingland wald I haue no vnite, Bot quho considder wald the verite, We micht full weill haue leuit in peice and rest, Nyne or ten ʒeitis, and than playit louse or fast. Had we with Ingland keipit our contrackis, Our nobyll men, had leuit in peice and rest. Our Merchādis had nocht lost so mony packis, Our commoun peple had nocht bene opprest. On ather syde, all wrangis had bene redrest. Bot Edinburgh sen syne, Leith and Kingorne, The day, and hour, may ban that I was borne, Our Gouernour, to mak hym to me sure, With sweit, and subtell wordis, I did hym syle, Tyll I his Sone, and Air, gat in my cure. To that effect I fand that crafty wyle, That he no maner of way ycht me begyle Than leuch I quhen his liegis did allege, How I his Sone had gottin in to plege.
The Erle of Angus, and his Germane brother. I purposit, to gar thame lose thare lyfe. Rycht so tyll haue destroyit mony vthtr, Sum with the fyre, sū with the sword and knyfe. In speciall, mony gentyll men of fyfe. And purposit tyll put to greit Torment All fauoreris of the auld, and new Testament. Than euery man, thay tuke of me sic feir, That tyme, quhen I had so greit gouernance. Greit Lordis dreiding, I suld do thame deir, Thay durst nocht cum tyll court but assurance Sen syne thair hes nocht bene sic variance. Now tyll our Prince Barronis obedientlie, But assurance, thay cum full courteslie. My hope was most in to the king of France, To gidder with the Popis holynes. More than in God, my worschip tyll auance. I traistit so in to thare gentilnes, That no man durst presume me tyll oppres. Bot quhen the day come of my fatall hour, Far was frome me, thare support and succour. Than to preserue my ryches, and my lyfe, I maid one strenth of wallis hich and braid. Sic ane Fortres wes neuer found in fyfe. Beleuand thare, durst no man me inuaid. Now fynd I trew the saw quhilk Dauid said: Without God of ane hous be maister of wark, He wirkis in vane, thocht it be neuer so stark.
For I was throuch the hi power Deuine, Rycht dulefullie doung doun amang the as, Quhilk culd not be throch mortal mānis ingyne, Bot as Dauid did slay the greit Golias, Or Holopherne, be Iudith keillit was In myd amang his triumphant Armie, So was I slane in to my cheif Ciete. Quhen I had greitest Dominatioun, As Lucifer had in the heuin Empyre, Came suddandlie my Depriuatioun. Be thame quhilk did my dolent deith conspyre. So cruell was thare furious birnand Ire, I gat no tyme, layser, nor liberte To say, ☞ In Manus tuas Domine. ☞BEhald my Fatall Infelicite, I beand in my strenth, Incomparabill, That dreidfull Dungeoun maid me no supple, My greit ryches, nor tentis proffitabill, My Syluer work, Iowellis inestimabill, My Papall pompe, of gold my ryche thresour, My lyfe and all, I lost in half ane hour. To the peple wes maid ane Spectakle, Of my deid, and deformit Carioun. Sum said it was ane manifest Myrakle. Sum said it was Diuine Punitioun So to be slane, in to my strang Doungeoun. Quhen euery man had Iugit as hym list, Thay Saltit me, syne closit me in ane kist.
I lay vnburyit sewin monethis and more, Or I was borne, to closter, kirk, or queir, In ane midding, quhilk pane bene tyll deplore, Without suffrage, of Chanoun, Monk, or freir. All proude Prelatis at me may Lessonis leir, Quhilk rang so lang, and so triumphantlie, Syne in the duct doung doun so dulefullie. ☞TO THE PRELATIS. O ʒe My Brether Princis of the Preistis, I mak ʒow hartly Supplicatioun, Boith nyckt and day reuolue in to ʒour breistis The Proces of my Depriuatioun. Considder quhat bene ʒour Vocatioun. To follow me, I pray ʒow nocht pretend ʒow, Bot reid at lenth, this Cedull that I send ʒow. Ʒe knaw quhow Iesus his Discipulis sent, Ambassadouris till euery Natioun, To schaw his law, and his commandement To all peple, by Predicatioun. Tharefor, I mak to ʒow Narratioun, Sen ʒe to thame ar verray Successouris, Ʒe aucht tyll do as did ʒour Predecessouris. Quhow dar ʒe be so bauld tyll tak on hand, For to be Herraldis to so greit ane King, To beir his Message, boith to burgh and land, Ʒe beand dum, and can pronunce no thing. Lyke Menstralis, that can nocht play nor sing. Or quhy suld men geue to sic Hirdis hyre, Quhilk can not gyde thare scheip about ye myre.
Eschame ʒe nocht to be Christis seruitouris, And for ʒour fee, hes greit temporall landis? Syne of ʒour office, can nocht tak the curis, As Cannone Law, & Scripture ʒow cōmandis. Ʒe wyll nocht want, teind scheif, nor offerandis, Teynd woll, teind lamb, teind Calf, teind gryce and guse, To mak seruice ʒe ar al out of vse. My deir brether do nocht as ʒe war wount, Amend ʒour lyfe now, quhill ʒour day Induris. Traist weill ʒe sall, be callit to ʒour count Of euerilk thyng, belanging to ʒour curis. Leif hasartrie, ʒour harlottie, and huris, Remembring on my vnprouisit deid. For efter deith, may no man mak remeid. Ʒe Prelat{is} quhilk{is} hes thousandis for to spend, Ʒe send ane sempyll freir, for ʒow to preiche, It is ʒour craft, I mak it to ʒow kend. Ʒour selfis, in ʒour Templis for to preiche, Bot ferlie nocht, thocht syllie freiris fleiche, For and thay planelie, schaw the verite, Than wyll thay want the Bischopis cherite. Quharefor bene gewin ʒow sic Royall rent? Bot for tyll fynd the peple Spirituall fude, Preichand to thame, the auld & new Testament, The law of God, doith planelie so conclude, Put nocht ʒour hope in to no warldlie gude, As I haue done, behauld my greit thresour, Maid me no help at my vnhappie hour.
That day quhen I was Bischop consecrait, The greit Byble, wes bound vpon my bak. Quhat wes tharein, lytle I knew God wait, More than ane beist, berand ane precious pak. Bot haistelie, my conuenant I brak For I wes oblissit with my awin consent. The law of God to preiche with gude intent. ¶Brether richt so quhen ʒe wer consecrait Ʒe oblissit ʒow all on the samyn wyse Ʒe may be callit Bischoppis countrefait, As Gallandis buskit for to mak ane gyse. Now think I Prineis, ar no thing to pryse, Tyll geue ane famous office tyll ane fule, As quho wald put ane Myter on ane Mule. Allace, and ʒe that sorrowfull sicht had sene, Quhow I lay bullerand, bathit in my blude, To mend ʒour lyfe, it had occasioun bene And leif ʒour auld, corruptit conswetude. Failʒeing thare of, than schortlie I conclude, Without ʒe frome ʒour ribaldrie aryse, Ʒe sall be seruit, on the samyn wyse. ❧TO THE PRINCIS. ¶Imprudent Princis but discretioun Hauyng in eirth power Imperiall, Ʒe bene the cause of this Transgressioun. I speik to ʒow all in to generall, Quhilk doith dispone all office spirituall, Geuand the saulis, quhilk{is} bene Christis scheip, To blind Pastouris but conscience to keip.
Quhen ʒe Princis doith laik ane officiar, Ane Baxter, Browster, or ane maister Cuke, Ane trym Tailʒeour, ane cunnyng Cordynar, Ouir all the land, at lenth ʒe wyll gar luke, Most abill men, sic officis tyll bruke. Ane Browster, quhilk can brew most hoilsū aill, Ane cūnyng Cuke, quhilk best can sessoun caill. Ane Tailʒeour quhilk hes fosterit bene in frāce, That can mak garmentis on the gayest gyse. Ʒe Princis bene the cause of this mischance, That quhen thare doith vaik ony benefyse, Ʒe aucht tyll do vpon the samyn wyse. Gaserche, and seik, baith in to burgh and land, The law of God quho best can vnderstand. Mak hym Bischop that prudentlie can preiche, A dois pertene tyll his vocatioun. Ane ione, quhilk his Parischoun can teiche. Ga Vcaris mak dew Ministratioun. And als I mak ʒow supplicatioun, Mak ʒour Abbottis of richt Religious men, Quhilk to the peple Christis law can ken. Bot not to rebaldis, new cum frome the rost. Nor of ane stuffat, stollin out of ane stabill, The quhilk in to the scule maid neuer na cost, Nor neuer was tyll Spirituall science abill, Except the cartis, the dyce, the ches, and tabill, Of Rome raikeris, nor of rude Ruffianis, Of calsay Paikeris, nor of Publicanis.
Nor of Fantastike▪ fenʒeit flatteraris, Most meit to gather mussillis in to May. Of Cowhubeis, nor ʒit of clatteraris, That in the kirk, can nother sing nor say Thocht thay be clokit vp i Clerkis array, Lyke doitit Doctoris new cum out of Athenis. And mūmyll ouer ane pair of maigt matenis. Nocht qualifyit, to bruke ane Benefyis, Bot throuch schir Symonis solistatioun. I was promouit on the samyn wyis, Allace throuch Princis supplicatioun. And maid at Rome throuch fals Narratioun, Bischop, Abbot, bot no Religious man. Quho me promouit, I now thare banis Quhowbeit I was Legate, and Cardinall, Lytle I knew, tharein quhat suld be done I vnderstude no science spirituall, No more than did blind Alane of the mone. I dreid the king that sittith hich aboue, On ʒow Princis sall mak sore punischement, Rycht so on vs throuch richteous Iugement. On ʒow Princis for vndiscreit geuing, Tyll Ignorantis, sic officis tyll vse. And we, for our Inoportune asking, Quhilk suld haue done sic dignite refuse. Our Ignorance, hes done the warld abuse Throuch Couetice of riches, and of rent. That euer I was ane Prelate I repent.
O Kingis mak ʒe no cair to geue in cure, Virginis profest in to Religioun, In tyll the keiping of ane commoun hure? To mak think ʒe nocht greit derisioun, Ane woman Persone of ane Parisoun? Quhare thare bene two thousand saulis to gyde, That frome harlottis can not hir hippis hyde. Quhat and king Dauid leuit in thir dayis, Or out of heuin quhat and he lukit down, The quhilk did found so mony fair Abbayis? Seand the greit Abhominatioun In mony abbayis, of this Natioun, He wald repent that Narrowit so his boundis, Of ʒeirly rent, thre score of thousand poundis. Quharfore I counsall euerilk Christiane king, Within his realme mak Reformatioun And suffer no mo Rebaldis, for to ring, Abufe Christis trew Congregatioun. Failʒeing thareof I mak Narratioun, That ʒe Princis, and Prelatis all at onis, Sall bureit be in hell, Saule, blude, and bonis. ¶That euer I brukit Benefice I rew, Or to sic hicht so proudely did pretend. I man depart, tharefor my freindis adew, Quhare euer it plesith God, now man I wend. I pray the till my freindis me Recommend, And failʒe nocht at lenth, to put in wryte My Tragedie, as I haue done Indyte. FINIS.
The deploratioun of The Deith of Quene Magdalene. ☞ ✚ ☜ O Cruell Deith, to greit is thy puissance Deuorar of all erthlie leuyng thingis Adam, we may the wyit of this mischāce In thy default, this cruell tyrane ringis And spairis nother Empryour nor Kingis.

Exemple of our Quene, the flour of France. O dreidfull Dragoun, with thy dulefull dart, Quhilk did nocht spair, of Feminine the flour, Bot cruellie did pers hir throuch the hart, And wald nocht giue hir respite for ane hour, To remane with hir Prince, and Paramour, That scho at laiser, mycht haue tane licence, Scotland on the, may cry ane loud vengeance. Thow leit Mathusalem, leif nine houndreth ʒeir Thre score and nyne, bot in thy furious rage. Thow did deuore, this ʒoung Princes but peir, Or scho was compleit, seuintene ʒeir of age,

O Dame Nature, thow did no diligence, Contrair this theif quhilk al ye warld cōfoundis.

So leill Luffaris without dissimulance. As Iames the Fift, and Magdalene of France, Discending boith of blude Imperiall, To quhome in lufe, I find no perigall. ☞For as Leander swame outthrow the flude, To his fair Lady Hero, mony nichtis, So did this prince, throw bulryng stremis wode With Erlis, baronis, squyaris, & with knichtis, Contrair Neptune, and Gol and thare michtis, And left his Realme in greit disesperance, To seik his Lufe, the first Dochter of France. And scho lyke prudent Quene Penelope, Ful cōstantlie wald change hym for none vther, And for his plesour, left hir awin countre, Without regard, to Father or to Mother, Takyng no cure of Sister, nor of Brother, Bot schortlie tuke hir leif, and left thame all,
For lufe of hym, to quhome lufe maid hir thrall. O dame Fortune quhare was thy greit confort, Till hir to quhome thow was so fauorable, Thy slyding gyftis, maid hir no support, Hir hie synage, nor Riches intellible, I se thy puissance bene bot variable, Quhen hir father the most hie cristinit King, Till his deir Chyld, mycht mak no supporting. The potent Prince, hir lustie lufe and knicht, With his most hardie Noblis of Scotland, Contrair that bailfull bribour had no micht, Thocht all the men had bene at his command, Of France, Flanderis, Italie, and Ingland, With fiftie thousand Millioun of tresour, Mycht nocht prolong that Ladyis lyfe ane hour. O Paris of all Citeis principall, Quhilk did resaue our Prince with laud & glorie Solempnitlie throw Arkis triumphall Quhilk day bene digne to put in memorie. For as Pompey efter his Victorie, Was in to Rome, resauit with greit Ioy, So thow resauit, our richt redoutit Roy. Bot at his Mariage maid vpon the morne, Sic solace, and Solempnizatioun, Was neuer sene afore, sen Christ was borne, Nor to Scotland sic consolatioun, Thare selit was, the confirmatioun, Of the weill keipit ancient alliance, Maid betuix Scotlād, and the realme of france,
I neuer did se, one day more glorious So mony in so riche abilʒementis, Of Silk and gold, with stonis precious, Sic Banketting, sic sound of Instrumentis, With sang, and dance, & Martiall tornamentis, Bot lyke ane storme, efter ane plesand morrow, Sone was our solace, changit in to sorrow.

Thow saw makand rycht costlie scaffalding, Depayntit weill, with Gold and asure fyne, Reddie preparit, for the vpsetting, With Fontanis flowing, watter cleir and wyne, Disagysit folkis, lyke Creaturis deuyne, On ilk scaffold, to play ane syndrie storie, Bot all in greiting, turnit thow that glorie.
Thow saw mony ane lustie fresche galland, Weill ordourit for resauing of thair Quene, Ilk Craftisman with bent bow in his hand, Full galʒeartlie in schort clething of grene, The honest Burges, cled thow suld haue sene, Sum in scarlot, and sum in claith of grane, For till haue met thare Lady Souerane.

Lustie Ladyis, that ʒour Libellis lukis My cumpanie, dois hald abhominable, Commandand me beir cumpanie to the Cukis, Moist lyke ane Deuill, thay hald me detestable. Thay banis me sayand, I am nocht able Thame to compleis, or preis to thare presence. Apon ʒour pen, I cry ane loud vengeance, Wer I ane Poeit, I suld preis with my pen To wreik me on ʒour wennemous wryting. Bot I man do, as dog dois in his den, Fald baith my feit, or fle fast frome ʒour flyting.

Quhat can ʒe say forther, bot I am tailʒeit In Venus werkis, I grant schir, that is trew.

And waist it nocht, bot gyf ʒe wit weill quhair. Thocht ʒe rin rudelie, lyke ane restles Ram, Schutand ʒour bolt, at mony sindrie schellis, Beleif richt weill, it is ane bydand gam. Quharefore bewar, with dowbling of the bellis, For mony ane dois haist thair awin saule knellis. And speciallie, quhen that the well gois dry, Syne can nocht get agane, sic stufe to by.

For lyke ane boisteous Bull, ʒe rin and ryde Royatouslie lyke ane rude Rubeatour, Ay fukkand lyke ane furious Fornicatour.

The Complaint and Publiet Confessioun of the Kingis auld Hound, callit Bagsche, directit to Bawte, the Kingis best belouit Dog, and his Companʒeonis. Maid at Command of King Iames the Fyft, be Schit Dauid Lindesay of the Mont Knycht, Alias, Lyoun king of Armes. &c. ALlace, quhome to suld I complayne In my extreme Necessitie. Or quhameto sall I mak my maine, In Court na Dog wyll do for me. Beseikand sum for Cherite To beir my Supplicatioun, To Scudlar, Luffra, and Bawte. Now or the King pas of the toun. I haue followit the Court so lang, Quhill in gude faith I may no mair. The Countre knawis I may nocht gang, I am so crukit, auld, and sair, That I wait nocht quhare to repair. For quhen I had authorite, I thocht me so familiar, I neuer dred necessite. I rew the race that Geordie Steill Brocht Bawte to the kingis presence. I pray God lat hym neuer do weill, Sen syne I gat na audience.
For Bawte now gettis sic credence, That he lyis on the Kingis nycht goun. Quhare I perforce for my offence, Man in the clois ly lyke ane loun. For I haif bene ay to this hour, Ane witrear of lamb and hog, Ane tyrrane, and ane Tulʒeour, Ane murdreissar of mony ane dog. Fyue foullis I chaist outthroch ane scrog, Quharefor thare motheris did me warie. For thay war drownit all in ane bog. Speir at Ihone Gordoun of Pittarie. Quhilk in his hous did bryng me vp, And vsit me to slay the deir. Sweit milk and meill he gart me sup, That craft I leirnit sone perqueir. All vther vertew ran arreir, Quhen I began to bark and flyte. For thare was nother Monk nor freir, Nor wyfe nor barne, bot I wald byte. Quhen to the King the care was knawin Of my vnhappy hardines, And all the suth vnto hym schawin How euerilk dog, I did oppres, Than gaue his grace command expres, I suld be brocht to his presence. Nochtwithstanding my wickitnes, In Court I gat greit audience.
☞ I schew my greit Ingratitude To the Capitane of Badzeno, Quhilk in his hous did find me fude Two ʒeir with vther houndis mo. Bot quhen I saw that it was so, That I grew hich into the Court, For his reward I wrocht hym wo And cruellie I did hym hurt. So thay that gaue me to the King, I was thare mortall Enemie. I tuke cure of na kynd of thing Bot pleis the Kingis Maiestie. Bot quhen he knew my crueltie, My falset and my plane oppressioun, He gaue command that I suld be Hangit without confessioun. And ʒit because that I was auld, His grace thocht petie for to hang me, Bot leit me wander quhare I wald, Than set my fais for to fang me. And euery bouchour dog doun dang me. Quhen I trowit best to be ane laird, Than in the court ilk wicht did wrang me. And this I gat for my rewaird. I had wirreit blak Makesoun, Wer nocht that rebaldis come and red. Bot he was flemit of the toun, Frome tyme the King saw how I bled. He gart lay me vpon ane bed, For with ane knife I was mischeuit.
This Makesoun for feir he fled Ane lang tyme or he was releuit. And Patrik Striuiling in Ergyle, I bure hym bakwart to the ground. And had hym slane within ane quhyle, Wat nocht the helping of ane hound. Ʒit gat he mony bludie wound, As ʒit his skyn wyll schaw the markis, Find me ane Dog, quhate euer ʒe found Hes maid sa mony bludie sarkis. Gude brother Lanceman, Lyndesayis dog, Quhilk ay hes keipit thy laute, And neuer wirryit lamb nor hog, Pray Luffra, Scudlar, and Baute, Of me Bagsche, to haue pitie, And prouide me ane portioun In Dumfermeling, quhare I may dre Pennance for my extortioun. Get be thare Solistatioun Ane letter frome the kingis grace, hat I may haue Collatioun, With fyre and Candil in the place. Bot I wyll leif schort tyme, allace, Want I gude fresche flesche for my gammis, Betuix Aswednisday and Paice, I man haue leue to wirrie Lamhis. Baute considder weill this bill, And reid this Cedul that I send ʒow. And euerilk poynt thareof fulfill,
And now in tyme of mys amend ʒow. I pray ʒow that ʒe nocht pretend ʒow To clym ouer hie, nor do na wrang. Bot frome ʒour fais, with richt defend ʒow, And tak exemple quhow I gang. I was that na man durst cum neir me, Nor put me furth of my lugeing. Na dog duist fra my Denner sker me, Quhen I was tender with the king. Now euerilk tyke dois me doun thring, The quhilk before, be me war wrangit, And sweris I serue na vther thing, Bot in ane helter to be hangit. Thocht ʒe b hamelie with the King, Ʒe Luffra, Scudlar, and Bawte, Be wat that ʒe do nocht doun thring Ʒour nychtbouris throw authorite. And ʒour exemple mak be me, And beleif weill ʒe at bot doggis. Thocht ʒe stand in the hiest gre, Se ʒe byte nother lambs nor hoggis. Thocht ʒe haue now greit audience, Se that be ʒow, be nane opprest. Ʒe ylbe punischit for ʒour offence, Frome tyme the king be weill confest, Thare is na dog that hes transgrest Throw cruelte, and he may fang hym, His Maieste wyll tak no rest, Tyll on ane gallous he gat hang hym.
I was anis als far ben as ʒe ar And had in Court als greit credence, And ay pretendit to be hiear. Bot quhen the Kingis excellence, Did knaw my falser and offence, And my prydefull presumptioun, I gat none vther recompence, Bot hoyit, and houndit of the toun. Wes neuer sa vnkynd ane corce As quhen I had authorite. Of my freindis I tuke na force, The quhilkis afore had done for me, This Prouerb, it is of verite, Quhilk I hard red in tyll ane letter, Hiest in Court, nixt the weddie, Without he gyde hym all the better. I tuke na mair compt of ane Lord, Nor I did of ane keiching knaif. Thocht euerilk day I maid discord, I was set vp abone the laif. The gentill hound was to me slaif. And with the Kingis a win fingeris fed. The sillie raichis wald I raif, Thus for my euill deidis wes I dred. Tharefor Bawte luke best about, Quhen thow art hiest with the King. For than thow standis in greitest dout, Be thow nocht gude of gouerning. Put na pure tyke frome his steiding,
Nor ʒit na sillie Ratchis raif. He sittis aboue that seis all thing, And of ane knicht can mak ane knaif. Quhen I come steppand ben the flure, All Rachis greit roume to me red. I of na creature tuke cure, Bot lap vpon the kingis bev, With claith of gold, thocht it wer spred, For feir ilk freik wald stand on far. With euerilk Dog, I was so dred Thay trimblit quhen thay hard me nar. Gude brother Bawte beir the euin, Thocht with thy Prince, thow be potent. It cryis ane vengeance frome the heuin, For till oppres ane Innocent. In welth be than most vigilent, And do na wrang to dog nor beiche, As I haue, quhilk I now repent. Na Messane reif, to mak the riche. Nor for augmenting of thy boundis Ask no reward, schit at the king. Quhilk may do hurt to vther houndis, Expres aganis Goddis bidding. Chais na pure tyke frome his midding, Throw cast of Court, or kingis requeist. And of thy self, presume no thing, Except thow art ane brutall beist. Traist weill thare is none oppressour, Nor boucheour dog drawer of blude,
Ane Tyrrane, nor ane transgressour, That sall now of the King get gude, Frome tyme furth, that his Celsitude Dois cleirlie knaw the verite, Bot he is flemit for to conclude, Or hangit hich vpon ane tre. Thocht ʒe be cuplit all to gidder With silk, and swoulis of syluer fyne. Ane Dog may cum furth of Balquhidder, And gar ʒow leid ane lwer tryne. Than sal ʒour plesour, turne in pyne, Quhen ane strange hounter blawis his horne. And all ʒour treddingis gar ʒow tyne, Than sall ʒour laubour be forlorne. I say no more gude freindis, adew, In dreid we neuer meit agane. That euer I kend the Court, I rew. Wes neuer wycht so will of wane. Lat no Dog now serue our Souerane, Without he be of gude conditioun. Be he peruerst, I tell ʒow plane, He hes neid of ane gude Remissioun. That I am on this way mischeuit, The Erle of Hountlie I may warie. He wend I had bene weill releuit, Quhen to the Court, he gart me carie. Wald God I wa now in Pittarie, Because I haue bene so euill dedie, Adew, I dar no langer tarie. In dreid, I waif in till ane wyddie. FINIS.
Ane Suplication di∣rectit frome Schir Dauid Lyndesay Knicht, to the Kingis grace, in Contemptioun of syde Taillis. SChir, thocht ʒour grace hes put gret ordour Baith in the Hieland and the Bordour, Ʒit mak I Supplicatioun, Tyll haue sum Reformatioun, Of ane small fat, quhilk is nocht Tressoun. Thocht it be contrarie to Ressoun. Because the Water bene so vyle, It may nocht haue ane Oruate yle. Quharefor I pray ʒour Excellence, To heir me with greit Pacience, Of stink and weidis maculate No man may mak ane Rois Chaiplat. Souerane, I mene of thir syde taillis, Quilk throw the dust and dubbis traillis, The quarteris lang behind thare heillis, Expres agane all Comoun weillis. Thocht Bischoppis in thare pontificallis, Haue men for to bei vp thare taillis, For dignite of thare office. Rychtso ane Quene, or ane Emprice, Howbeit thay vse sic grauite, Comformand to thare Maieste. Thocht thare Rob Royallis be vpborne, I think it is ane verray scorne, That euery Lady of the land, Suld haue hir taill so syde trailland,
Howbeit thay bene of hie estait, The Quene thay suld nocht counterfait. Quhare euer thay go, it may be sene, How kirk, and calsay thay soup clene. The Imagis in to the kirk, May think of thare syde tailis Irk, For quhen the wedder bene most fair, The dust fleis hiest in the air, And all thare facis dois begarie. Giue thay culd speik, thay wald thame warie. To se I think ane plesand sicht, Of Italie the Ladyis bricht, In thare clething most triumphand, Aboue all vther christin land. Ʒit quhen thay trauell throw the townis, Men seis thare feit beneth thare gownis, Four Inche abone thare proper heillis Circulat about als round as quheillis. Quhare throw thare dois na poulder ryis, Thare fait quhyte lymmis to suppryis. Bot I think maist abusioun, To se men of Religioun, Gar beir thare taillis throw the streit, That folkis may behald thare feit. I trow sanct Bernard, nor sanct Blais, Gart neuer man beir vp thare clais. Peter, nor Paule, nor sanct Androw, Gart neuer beir vp thare taillis I trow, Bot I lauch best to se ane Nwn, Gar beit hir taill abone hir bwn,
For no thing ellis as I suppois, Bot for to schaw hir lillie quhyte hois. In all thare Rewlis, thay will nocht find, Quha suld beir vp thair taillis behind. Bot I haue maist in to despyte, Pure Claggokis cled in roiploch quhyte, Quhilk hes skant twa markis for thare feis, Wyll haue twa ellis beneth thare kneis. Kit, tok that clekkit wis ʒistrene, The morne wyll counterfute the Quene. Ane murcland Meg that mylkit the ʒowis, Claggit with clay abone the howis, In barn, nor byit, scho wyll nocht byde, Without hir kirtyll taill be syde, In Burtowis wantoun burges wyiffis, Quha may haue sydest taillis stryiffis, Weill bordourit with Veluoit fyne, Bot following thame it is ane pyne. In Somer quhen the streitis dryis, Thay rais the dust abone the skyis. None may go neir thame at thare eis, Without thay couer mouth and neis, Frome the powder, to keip thare ene. Consider giue thare Cloiffis be clene. Betuixt thare cleuing, and thare kneis, Quha mycht behald thare sweitie theis, Begairit all with dirt, and dust, That wer aeuch to stanche the lust Of ony man that saw thame naikit. I think sic giglottis ar bot glaikit,
Without profite to haue sic pryde, Harland thare claggit taillis so syde. I wald thay borrowstounis barnis had breikkis To keip sic mist fra Malkinnis cheikkis. I dreid rouch Malkin de for drouth, Quhen sic dry dust blawis in hir mouth. I think maist pane, efter ane rane, To se thame towkit vp agane. Than quhen thay step furth throw the streit. Thare faldingis flappis about thair feit. Thare laithlie lyning furthwart flypit, Quhilk hes the muk, and midding wypit. Thay waist more claith within few ʒeitis. Nor wald cleith fyftie score of freitis. Quhen Marioun frome the midding gois, Frome hir morne turne, scho strypit the nois. And all the day quhare euer scho go, Sic liquour scho likkith vp also. The Turcumis of hir taill I trow. Mycht be ane supper till ane sow. I ken ane man, quhilk swoir greit aithis. How he did lift ane Kittokis claithis, And wald haue done, I wait nocht quhat. Bot sone remeid of lufe he gat. He thocht na schame to mak it wittin, How hir syde taill was all beschittin, Of filth sic flewer straik till his hart, That he behouit for till depart. (Quod scho) sweit schir, me think ʒe rew, (Quod he) ʒour taill makis sic ane slew,
That be sanct Brybe, I may nocht byde it, Ʒe war nocht wyse, that wald nocht hyde it, Of Caillis I wyll no more Indyte, For dreid sum Duddroun me despyte. Nocht withstanding, I wyll conclude, That of syde Taillis can cum na gude. Syder nor may thare hanclethis hyde, The remanent, proceidis of pryde. And Pryde proceidis of the Deuill. Thus alway thay proceid of euill. ☞Ane vther fault Schir, may be sene, Thay hyde thare face all bot the ene. Quhen gentill men biddis thame gude day, Without Reuerence thay slyde away. That none may knaw, I ʒow assure, Ane honest woman be ane hure. Without thare naikit face I se, Thay get no mo gude dayis of me Hails ane Frence Lady quhen ʒe pleis, Scho wyll discouer mouth, and neis. And with ane humill countenance, With Visage bair mak reuerence. Quhen our Ladyis dois ryde in rane, Suld no man haue thame at disdane, Thocht thay be couerit mouth and neis. In that cace thay wyll nane displeis. Nor quhen thay go to quiet places, I thame excuse to hyde thare facis, Quhen thay wald mak Collatioun, With any lustie Companʒeoun,
Thocht thay be hid than to the ene, Ʒe may considder quhat I mene. Bot in the kirk, and market placis, I think thay suld nocht hide thare facis. Without thir faltis be sone amendit, My flyting, schir, sall neuer be endit. Bot wald ʒour grace my counsall tak, Ane Proclamatioun ʒe suld mak, Baith throw the land and Borrowstounis, To schaw thare face, and cut thare gownis, Nan suld fra that Exemptit be, Except the Quenis Maieste, Because this mater is nocht fair, Of Rethorik it man be bair. Wemen wyll say this is no bourdis, To wryte sic vyle and filthy wordis. Bot wald thay clenge thare filthy taillis, Quhilk ouir the myris and middingis traillis, Than suld my wrytting clengit be. None vther mendis thay get of me. The suith suld nocht be haldin clos, Veritas non querit Angulos. I wait gude wemen that bene wyse, This rurall Ryme wyll nocht dispryse. None wyll me blame, I ʒow assure, Except ane wantoun glorious hure, Quhais flyting I feir nocht ane fle. Fair weill, ʒe get no more of me.

Quhat day, how oft, quhat scort, and quhare? (Quod he) I wald I had bene thare. He me absoluit for ane plak, Thocht he na pryce with me wald mak. And mekle Latyne he did mummill. I hard na thing bot hummill bummill. He schew me nocht of Goddis word, Quhilk scharper is than ony sword, And deip in tyll our hart dois prent, Our Syn, quhairthrow we do repent. He pat me na thing in to feir, Quharethrow I suld my syn forbeir. He schew me nocht the Maledictioun Of God for Syn, nor the afflictioun. And in this lyfe, the greit mischeif, Ordanit to punische hure, and theif. Nor schew he me of hellis pane, That I mycht feir, and vice refrane. He counsalit me nocht till abstene, And leid ane holy lyfe and clene. Of Christis blude, na thing he knew,
Nor of his promisses full trew, That saifis all that wyll beleue, That Sathan sall vs neuer greue. He techit me nocht for tyll traist, The confort of the haly Gaist, He bad me nocht to Christ be kynd, To keip his law, with hart and mynd, And loue and thank his greit mercie. Fra Syn, and hell, that sauit me. And lufe my Nichtbour as my sell. Of this na thing he could me tell. Bot gaue me pennance ilk ane day, Ane Aue Marie for to say. And Frydayis fyue, na fische to eit.
