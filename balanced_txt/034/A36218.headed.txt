Spiritual Community, vindicated amongst people of different perswasions in some things. ALL those that place the Bond of their Community in the Universal Light, or Spirit of Grace, which is an inward principle of the Di∣vine Life, whereby all good people governs their Actions; they have a witness in every mans Conscience, that witness for God that their hearts are right towards him; this Divine Principle is in some mea∣sure in all Mankind, although many regards it not, but slights the day of Gods Visitation, but those that are guided by it, have Unity and Spiritual Community, with the least measure of grace that appears in the Lives and Conversations of any person, or persons, wheresoever it appears: This Divine Principle is sufficient to preserve a Nation, or People in Peace, if men would regard it; this is an Infallible guide, all things have failed and will fail, the several forms and orders of Religious people breaks not the community of a Nation or People in publick concerns; if they be governed by this Divine Principle, not placing the Bond of their Community in such Forms and Ceremonies as are the prescriptions of men; to the damage of others by imposing them; all outward Impositions of Divine Worship towards God, were under the first Covenant (to the Heb. 9. Jews only) and made not the comers thereunto perfect as pertaining to Conscience. But too many have placed the Bond of their Community in the wrong thing or things, to the damage of others, some in Church Traditions, and the severe Opinions or Expositions of the Fathers, whereby great distensi∣on have arose amongst themselves in many Ages, followed on by a separation and persecuting one another: some place the Bond of their Community in their Church Faith and Directories, others in the Penal Statutes and Eccle∣siastical Laws made against Dissenters, for the upholding their Church Litur∣gy, and all these have proceeded as formerly, by Persecution to uphold the greatness of their worldly Profession, or covetous Colos. 3. Self-interest, which is Idolatry. Yet there are persons of several different perswasions that are not to be blamed, because they have been true to their Principle in an innocent friend∣ly Conversation, using their outward forms or ceremonies as if they used
them not, not placing the Bond of their Community in them, to the da∣mage of any that were not in the same conformity with them; many of these have been serviceable in their day and generation, being moved to it by an inward sense of the love of God in their hearts, which have extended it self through them unto others of different perswasions from them, and have been a help and relief to many in suffering times, which are the times of trial and discovery of the Spirits of all Mankind. But to prevent the continuance of former miscarriages, the King hath been graciously pleased to set forth his Declaration of Liberty to all peace∣able People, to serve God publickly according to their several perswasions; this is Gods own work which he hath put in the Kings heart, and is a cer∣tain way to root out Hypocrisie and self ended worldly profession out of the Kingdom: May he live and prosper in this good work, and by the help of Divine Providence bring it to some perfection, for no Nation or People can be really happy where an intire Liberty is not granted to all peaceable peo∣ple; forcing mens Consciences makes Hypocrites, it is Divine Love and Charity that brings a Nation or People into such Unity as to love God above all, and their Neighbour as themselves. It is likely that many are dissatisfied with this Declaration, and the Kings Suspending the Penal Statutes against Dissenters, but let them examine the ground from whence such dissatisfaction do arise, it is not from the love of God in their hearts, but from the love of the World, fears and doubts arising in their minds that they may loose some of their worldly profits and enjoyments, or that the greatness of their profession may be clouded or detected; Christianity teacheth us to part with all for Christ, and to take up the Cross and follow him, I do not mean an outward Cross of Silver, Gold, Wood, or Stone, or any such like thing, but to come into Unity with that Divine Principle which crosseth that nature in themselves that leads them into sin, it is that corrupt nature that separates man from the true knowledge of God, and leadeth him either into impious presumption, or into fears, doubts, and distrust of Gods mercies to him, to profess Christianity, and to deny the Cross is but mocking of God, and deceiving themselves. All worldly professors that place the Bond of their Community in their Church Liturgy, or any other prescription of man, to the damage of others, let them know, that their foundation is sandy, and will not stand in a day of tryal, if they should come to want liberty themselves their mouths will he stopt from complaining, they can have nothing to say for themselves that would not allow it to others; the Penal Statutes made against Dissenters up∣on the account of Religion, are but superficial Laws made for the present imaginaries of State, and holds no longer than the reason of them holds, the Kings Declaration shows a sufficient reason to suspend them to satisfie any unbiassed person or persons whatsoever, that prefer the publick Peace
above Self-interest: It is no new thing for Kings to Suspend superficial Laws, or lay them aside without Repeals, there may be found in the Old Statute Book divers. Statutes that are out of use, yet never Repealed, only Suspend∣ed or laid aside, and not without good reason. Laws have been so mulplyed against Dissenters from the Church of England that they clash one against another; some Statutes are to compel people to come to Church, others are to Excommunicate them from it; there are Statutes also to make upon the same account, for Imprisoning them and spoiling them of their outward Estates, if they serve God publickly, in any other place but the National Church, although they be Excommunica∣ted from her, and she her self professes in her Common Prayer, that the Service of God is perfect freedom, and that we ought at all times, and in all places, to give thanks to God for the great benefits received at his hands, &c. Yet all these aforesaid Statutes were severely prosecuted against Dissenters, so that a very great number of innocent people that would not turn Hypo∣crits and conform to them, contrary to their judgments, were exposed to cruel Sufferings by a long grinding Persecution that have continued many years, so that the nature of Christianity was quite excluded from amongst the most Active men in Power, and their Adherence. This is sufficient to stop the mouths of all those that are dissatisfied with the Kings Declaration, and Suspending the Penal Statutes made against Dissenters from the Church of England. To conclude, The blindness and ignorance have been great amongst some people in power, that they accounted all their own, and foresaw no danger or day of reckoning, or rendring an account of their actions, ei∣ther to God, or Man; their ignorance and blindness will be no excuse for them, every one must render an account of their deeds, whether they be good or evil; yet it is beneath the Nobility of any true Christian to seek re∣venge, or to lay them publickly open any further than may be for the pre∣servation of the Peace of the Kingdom for the future, that the Poor, the Widdow, and the Fatherless, or any other persons whatsoever, may no more be made a Prey to Vain-glorious and Self-ended worldly Professors, or profane persons also, that makes use of Religion for a decoy to catch the World; these ought to be publickly detected, that all peaceable people may have rest, and sit down under their own Vine, and under their own Fig-Tree, serving God according to their several perswasions, every one preferring the publick Peace above their own worldly interests, which are my desires to God for them all, having nothing but love in my heart for the whole Creation, and do Travel for their Redemption from the Bondage of Corruption.
Our God is Love, So they that be In love with him, their faults may see; And pittying their unhappy state, Shew them their Sin e're 'tis too late, That true Repentance they may find Like Balm to cure their troubled mind. Given forth in the Second Month, called April, 168. Ann Docwra. THE END.
