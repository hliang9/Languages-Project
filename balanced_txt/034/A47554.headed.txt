TO READER AND HEARER, GRACE And Salvation through Christ Je∣sus. IT may be needful to premise a few words, and I shall do it specting these and other Papers joyntly. Expect not Excellency of Speech, or human Wisdom; I pretend not reto: Nor would it befie them with whom I ve to do.

A Knock at the Door of Christ∣less ones, &c. HOw many Distinctions soever may  made of Persons, all come ∣der that made by the Apostle,  Cor. 13. 5. Christ is in them, or they  () Reprobates. And if now  Reprobate, whether not for ever so?  Lord knows. And 'tis a question so W∣ty, as bespeaks utmost endeavour of asp∣dy and happy Resolution. My present b∣ness is with them in whom Christ is: Ye would not pass the Christless, as if th were no such in the World, seeing th are the most by far; nor as if these we not to be minded, who mind not themselve Ah! My Heart is towards them, they  much longed for: And to see Christ as such a one Embrace, would be a joyful sigh Give me leave to turn aside to speak a wo to them, and to ask them how they  Poor Hearts! how is it with you? in wha State are you? O that you would singly, s∣riously ask; what am I? whose am I? whe

O Death will be upon you! Eternity  hastening? are you ready? are you will∣ing to go? Some poor Christless Creatures oo often say, they are ready, and willing too. But Alas! They know not what they say. What Christless, and ready to ? that's impossible: Christless, and will∣ing to dye? that's Irrational. To such I shall ow add but this, O Labor to be sensible. . What it is to be Christless, 2C. 13 5. Ep. 2. 12. word. What it is to dye so, L. 16. 22, 23. Rev. 2015. 3. I refer them to the serious Considera∣tion of what is elsewhere offered to such as make light of dying. And to Mr. Alleines iseries of the unconverted. But for other poor Carnal Worldly Christ∣less Graceless ones, are they unwilling to d!ye? Ah! who can blame them? and O that their unwillingless did Spring from a due sense of their unfitness! It is not a light thing, to part with their Worldly good things, their Creature Comforts, their Por∣tion in this life; yea natural life it self, for which a man will give all that he hath: And to make their Bed in darkness, and in the Pit
of Corruption; yea, to cry to Corruptio  Father! and to the Worm, O Mother!  Sister! And for an immortal Soul to  Wing for another World, and to Lanc  Eternity, not knowing whither it is going  or what will become of it▪ To cry, as  that said, I have lived in care, I dye in dou but whither I am going, I cannot tell:  as that other (Poor, tho Worldly gr one) cryed, O my Poor, Litt Trembling, wandring Soul, whit art thou going! into I know not wh P. p.

made new Creatures. It was the State  such as now are Saints, till they were ch∣ed: And you being unchanged, it is your S still. And therefore so look upon it, and  affected with it, Rom. 3. 9. 1 Cor. 6. 9. 10, 1 Tit. 3. 3. 2. Cor. 13. 5. Joh. 3. 6. Rom 8. 9. 3. Consider, that whosoever is not a  Creature, is not in Christ: Nor can lay cl to any saving Benefit by him. 2 Cor. 5. 17.  13. 5. Rom. 8, 9, 10. Gal. 5. 24. Tit. 2. 11, 1 13, 14. Joh. 13. 8. Acts 3. 19. 4. Consider, that whosoever is not  Christ, is in a State of Damnation. Un wrath present, and bound over to wrath  come, Rom. 8. 1. Joh. 3. 36. Ephe. 2. 3.  Thes. 1. 10. Rom. 2. 4, 5, 6. 8, 9. Acts 4. 5 Consider, that without a saving Cha there is no Salvation. Whosoever is  changed, is not only in a State of Damnati∣on, but without a Change can never be f∣ed. Christ neither will, nor can save th without changing thee. Joh. 3. 3. 5. and  5, 6, 7. Thou must turn, or dye: Be Chang∣ed, or Damned. Ezek. 18. 30, 31. and  11. Acts 3. 19. 2 Thes. 2. 12. Joh. 3. 18, 19. 6. Consider, while thou livest, and art  an unchanged Christless, Gracless, State be thy natural endowments never so excellent thy life never so innocent, and spotless; th temper, and carriage never so sweet; th
ments, Profession and Practice in Re∣, and place in the Church never so E∣t; be thou a Titus Vespatian, (Delitiae  Generis, the delight of mankind) in e, and civil honesty; an unconverted  in Morality and Legal Piety; a Judas,  Disciple of Jesus; a Demas, a Paul's Com∣ion, and Fellow Labourer in the profes∣n, and Propagation of Christianity. Acts 6. 4, 5. Phil. 3. 5, 6. Acts 1. 16, 17. Philem. 4. with 2 Tim. 4. 10. Yea, be thou Paul's pposed Blazing-Comet in the Christian rch; 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2, 3. Yet, thou canst lease God in nothing: Neither Person, Ser∣vice no Sacrifice, can ever be accepted; but all is abomination to him: Mic. 6. 67. Pro. 15. 8. and so thou art cut off from all hope of ever finding Mercy, or Favour with him, ving or dying; here, or hereafter. 1 Cor. . 14. Rom. 8. 8. Ephe. 1. 6. Heb. 11. 4, 5, 6. and 12. 28, 29. Phil. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 7. Consider, what a sad thing it is, not to be able to look upon life or Death with com∣fort: Not to be able to bid life farewell, or Death welcome with comfort. And is not this thy case? O sweet, and joyful thing, to be able to look back upon Life, and say, my rejoycing is this, the Testimony of my Con∣science, that in Simplicity and Godly Since∣rity, not with Fleshly Wisdom, but by the
Grace of God, I have had my Conversatio in the World! 2 Cor. 1. 12. And to look ∣ward upon Death, and say, I know, that  my Earthly House of this Tabernacle  dissolved, I have a Building of God, an  not made with Hands, Eternal in the  vens! 2 Cor. 5. 1. Yea, to look on both,  say, to me to live is Christ, and to dye  gain! Phil. 1. 21. But doth not thy Conscience tell thee, th this comfort is none of thine? That tho may'st read these Scriptures backwards?  at least leave thee in the Dark; that th knowest not what will become of thee in a d∣ing Hour? Whither thou shalt go? whe thou shalt be when gone hence, and gon for ever? what thy Eternity will be when here thou shalt be no more? O dear Soul▪ It is a dreadful, a Heart-shaking thing, to be grabbling at the Door of Eternity, not know∣ing whether it will open into Heaven or Hell! But how much more, if Conscience tell thee that the question is out of question, and tho condemned already! Thy Sentence already past, that thou shalt not see life! Joh. 3. 18. 3. O the Fear, the Dread, the Terrours, the horrours, the Sorrows of Death, to such a poor Heart! O sad! not to be able to bid Death welcome! But how direful to come so unwel∣come! Isa. 33, 14.
8. Consider, be it comfort or discomfort,  thou willing, or unwilling; ready, or un∣ly, Christian, or Christless; dye thou ; dye thou shalt. Ah Soul! Death will ; and when it comes, it will neither go out thee, nor yet stay for thee: Thou er canst, nor shalt dye by a Deputy; or  respited to get ready. Then, go thou st, and presently too: Go thou shalt,  all as thou art. Fit, or unfit; clean, or ; Cloathed, or Naked; changed, or un∣anged; in Christ, or Christless; away thou lt: All as thou art, all as thou art. O well a little upon the thoughts of it! Gn.  19. Job 7. 1. and 14. 5. and 16. 22. Prov.  32. These Scriptures (amongst others) Confirm it: And not by a may-be, but a shall. Take but one more, Job 18. 23, 14. 18. 9. Consider, whether thou mind it, or for∣get it; Sleep, or Watch; look for thy Lord,  ant it with the Rabble; Death will not ly come, but it may be nearer then thou  aware. Dye thou must, dye thou shalt,  thou wilt say so too; but thou hopest it  far off yet: Well, but consider, Death is  more certain, than the time uncertain. Dye thou shalt, I, and it may be sooner than thou thinkest of. Death will be upon thee;  and may not, will not it be 'ee thou look for it? Doth not the fatal stroak, use
a surprizing stroak? Job 21. 13. 23, 24.  36. 14. Mat. 24. 37, 38, 39. 42. to the  1 Thes. 5. 2, 3. Luke 12. 17, 18, 19. 40. Ma 13. 35, 36, 37. 10. Consider, dying Christless; dye ri or poor; young or old, sooner or later, ∣denly or languidly, thou wilt dye dreadf∣ly. Ah poor Heart! thou art he, or  whoever thou art, that wilt dye at a  dreadful rate. The Death of the Body  no Trifle, yet what were dying, if the Dea of the Body were all? dying is a commo word, and commonly lightly spoken:  'tis no light thing to dye. O Soul! dyin work is Weighty work. Deut. 32. 29. The blessed dying, and Curssed dying; Rev. 1 13. Isa. 65. 20. Joyful dying, and dreadfu dying. Pro. 14. 32. There's dying, and do ble dying; Psal, 89. 48. Rev. 2. 11. and  6. 14. This sheweth that there is a differenc in dying: And what ever the difference b besure poor Christless ones, dye at the wor rate. Dye when thou wilt, or how thou wil▪ thou ever dyest dreadfully. (See Mem to Mori.) 1. Thou wilt dye nocently, dye guilty, dye in thy Sins. Ah poor Soul! No Christ, no Pardon, no Conversion, no Remission. Acts 5. 31. No close with Christ, no Benefit by Christ. Therefore thou must bear thi
own Burthen, dye in thy Sins, and canst thou e worse? Is not that dreadful dying? Joh. . 24. Job 20. 11. 2. Dye violently, dye suddenly, and hard∣ly: However any may think, thou seemest o go away like a Lamb; Death will hale and rry thee away: It will prey upon, and de∣our thee, Pro. 14. 32. Psal. 49. 14. Job 18. 0. To the end. Ah poor Heart! Thou t (like, nay,) sure to know the Strength f Death. Is not that a dreadful dying. 3. Dye Cruelly, dye Terribly. There's tterness, Fear, Horrour, Sorrow, Pain, Sting, orment, Poyson, in Death: None but Christ can fetch it out, and take it away, therefore it comes with all to Christless es. The Bitterness, Fears, Horrours, Sorrows, Pains, Sting, Torments, Poyson of Death, are all thine! 1 Cor. 15. 56. Who∣ever dye sweetly, thou wilt dye bitterly: Whoever find Deaths Clemency, thou wilt d and feel it's utmost cruelty. And is ot that dreadful dying? 4. Dye unready, dye untimely, dye when thou wilt, thou wilt dye unfit, unready. Should'st thou live the Age of Methusalah,  a thousand times told, thou wilt (dye Christless) dye unready. Mat. 24. 37, 38.  and 25. 10, 11, 12. Whoever love, and  for the appearing of Christ; thou art
sure he will come too soon for thee▪ W ever are so fit, as to stretch out their N look, and wish, desire, and Pa for Deaths coming to set th .

Poor Heart! whoe be prepared, Mat. 25. 10. Thou art u still; unready still, and sure so to dye at  Verse 11, 12. And is not that dreadful dyin (see unready dying, dreadful dying.) 5. Dye Eternally; Dye, first and seco Death; dye for ever, Rom. 6. 23. Rev.  6. 14, 15. The second Death, Death E∣nal, is the Extremity, and perpetuity of  Misery. The Death of the Body is  the Image, the shadow of Death. T Death of poor Christless ones, is an invi Death: An inconceivable Death; no To can tell it, no Pencil Paint or delin

We may say, O the Pains,  Pangs, the Sorrows, the Terrours, the rours, the Anguishes, the Gripings, the wing, the Dolours, the Stings, the s, (Ardoribus perpetuis) the everlasting ings of it!

Consider, in Christ, or Christless; oathed, or Naked, Weight or wanting;  Judgement thou shalt go. There is no e∣ing, or evading it: No appearing by an ney, nor being reprieved till bet∣ prepared. O Soul! 'Tis not, thou st go, but thou must go: 'Tis not, s thou wilt, but thou shalt. In vain  to cry to Rock or Mountain, to hide  cover thee; Rocks will rent, Mountains  Hills flee away Alas!

But, what will they  worth when they are for ever gone? Luke 19. 42. Offered-Salvation worth nothing? But Soul! W will lost Salvation be worth? Ponder Acts 13. 46.  2. 2, and 3. 11. Well Soul! 'Ere it be too late;  down, and seriously consider these things. Lay th upon thy Heart. And whatever thy thoughts of th things are now, think what thoughts thou shalt h of them one day.

Mat. 22. 11, 12,  And, yet once more, whatever account thou make of ; sit down, and consider; what Christ, Grace, a edding Garment, Oyl, Substance, Solidity, Weight,  Life of Grace, the Power of Godliness, Sincerity,  Holiness, and perfect Holiness will be worth one !
