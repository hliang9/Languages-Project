AN ACCOUNT Of the Taking THE EARL OF ARGYLE; On Thursday the Seventeenth Instant. Communicated in a Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country, go his Friend in Dublin. Carrickfergus, June 22. 1685. SIR, I Gave you in my last an account of the taking Dunstasnage Castle (with the store of Arms and Ammunition) from Argyle; since which ill suc∣cess, his Souldiers daily desert him; and being closely pursued by the Marquess of Athol, I have now this account to give (which we have both so long wish'd for) of his self being taken, flying away in disguise (by a couple of mean Fellows near Grinock) all alone, with a Pack at his back; the manner of it was thus: After he saw his dan∣ger, and how he was surrounded by Sea and Land, takes to his Disguise in the Night, leaving what Force he had to shift as well as they could
Upon his march towards an Arm of the Sea he was discovered, by offering Five Pounds for a Boat to ferry over to some place where he thought he might be secure, if he could but obtain the o∣ther side. The Five Pounds discovering his design, he was stopt; but before he was securred, fired both his Pistols, and what other Fire Arms he had. In the bustle he received a Wound, which is thought to be mortal. After he was taken, being asked who he was, confessed himself to be The Unfortunate Argyle. Sir John Cockran, they say, managed his part to better success, who opposed the Kings Forces valiently till Night: and when he heard of Argile's being taken, he thought the Night the fittest time for him to shif for himself. Whether he be se∣cured or no, is uncertain; though I am informed, he was carried to Glasgow with Argyle, and the rest of the Prisoners. FINIS. Printed in the Year 1685
