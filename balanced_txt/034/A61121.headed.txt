A True and Faithful RELATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE FORCES of Their MAJESTIES K. WILLIAM and Q. MARY, In their Expedition against the FRENCH, IN THE Caribby Islands IN THE WEST-INDIES: Under the Conduct of His Excellency Christopher Codrington, Captain General and Comman∣der in Chief of the said Forces, In the Years 1689, and 1690. Written by THOMAS SPENCER, Jun. Secretary to the Honourable Sir Timothy Thornhil Baronet, to whose Re∣giment he was Muster-Master, and supplied the Place of Commissary. London, Printed for Robert Clavel at the Peacock, at the West-End of St. Paul's Church-yard, 1691.
To the Right Honourable EDWARD RUSSEL, Admiral of Their Majesties Fleet for the Year 1691. Treasurer of Their Majesties Navy, and one of the Lords of Their Majesties most Ho∣nourable Privy Council. Right Honourable, I Might justly imagin my self to be thought rude and im∣pertinent, when I first presumed to tender this Account to your Honour; and I should never have adventured upon so great a Boldness, if I had not thought it re∣ally my Duty to present it to your Honours View: And the Reason which moved me to it was, because the most notable Actions herein related, as the taking of St. Christophers and St. Eustace, were the immediate Success of part of that Royal Navy, which your Honour now happily commands in Chief; I mean that Squadron commanded by Admiral Wright in the West Indies, without which it had been ut∣terly impossible for the English to have enterprized any thing in those Parts: For their Majesties Islands there were so depopulated by a raging Mortality, that the sur∣viving Inhabitants were even harrassed with a daily Fa∣tigue
to defend themselves. Ʋpon this Motive, joyn'd with the Consideration of the innate Generosity, which is ge∣nerally found in all Persons so Nobly and Honourably descended as your self; but is so peculiar to the most No∣ble Family of Bedford, and with which (as you are a Principal Branch thereof, so) you are principally adorned; I first assumed the Blodness to address you Honour with a Copy of this Relation; and the high Favour you were pleased to vouchsafe me, in your Perusal and Approbation of it, when it was a Manuscript, hath encouraged me not only to send it to the Press, but hath also emboldened me to implore your Patronage to countenance it, with which it will be sufficiently honoured and defended, and may boldly appear in Publick. But for the return of so high an Obli∣gation, as it transcends the utmost of my Hopes to accom∣plish, so I must confess my Incapacity to make any farther Advances towards it, than an humble and grateful Acknow∣ledgement, which shall ever be paid with the strictest Ob∣servance, by him who craves leave to subscribe himself, Right Honourable,  Your Honour's Most Humbly Devoted and Obedient Servant, Thomas Spencer.
A True and Faithful Relation OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THEIR Majesties Forces, IN THE CARRIBBY ISLANDS. THE Design of this small Treatise, is to give a Succinct Relation, of the Proceedings of their Majesties Forces, in the Caribby-Islands; and in a plain and Compendious Method, a faithful Narrative of the most remarkable Transactions, from the begin∣ning of the War, to this present time: Only I must desire to be excused, in the Omission of noting the particular Days of the Month in some places, The loss of some Papers, having forced me to be less exact in the Per∣formance of that, than I could wish; but as that is not absolutely material and per se, but only circumstantial and per Accidens, I presume it may the more easily be pardoned. But before I fall upon the intended Matter, I think it not amiss, to shew the first grounds and Reasons of the Differences, which have happened in those parts. Be pleased then to know, that the Island of St. Christophers hath formerly been a Stage of War between the English and French: But of late Years Matters being accommodated, and the Island divided between them, they have each of them lived under their own Government, and an Act of Neutrality hath passed by the Consent of both their Kings, to the Intent they might there enjoy a quiet and an Uninterrupted Peace, notwithstanding any Wars that might happen between the two Crowns in Europe: But the French being a fickle and inconstant People, broke through all those Considerations, and before the Wars were Proclaimed between England and France, prompted by some private Animosities of their own, and animated by the Instigations and Impulsions of some Irish upon the Island; in the Month of July 1689, entred the English ground with Fire and Sword, forcing the Inhabitants to fly to the Fort for their safety. The English being in this Distress, applied themselves to the Government of Barbados for Assistance; upon which application the Honourable Sir Timothy Thornhil Baronet, offered himself, to go at the Head of a Regiment to their Relief; to which the Governour Council and assembly assenting, the Drums
beat up for Voluntiers, and in less than a Fortnight, there was raised a Regiment of seven Hundred able Men, all which (the Commissioned Officers excepted) were fitted with Arms, &c. for the said Expedition, at the Cost and Charges of the Island of Barbados, convenient Vessels being also provi∣ded, for the transporting them to the Island of St. Christophers. All things being in a Readiness, they Imbarqued and set Sail on Thursday the first of August, and on Monday following, being the Fifth of the said Month, they arrived at the Island of Antigua, where they received the unwelcome News, that the Fort at St. Christophers was surrendred to the French, on Monday the 29th of July upon Articles, and the English sent off to the adjacent Island of Nevis. Affairs being thus Stated, Sir Timothy Thornhil knowing his Strength to be inconsiderable to attack an Island so well mann'd and fortified as St. Christophers; And the Government of Antigua also solliciting him to continue with them till the Arrival of the English Fleet, which was daily expected; he agreed to their Proposals, and landed his Regiment there, quartering them in the Town of Falmouth. After a Months Continuance in the said Island, Lieutenant General Cod∣rington sent three Sloops, Man'd with fourscore of Sir Timonthy's Regiment under the Command of Captain Edward Thorne, to fetch their Majesties Sub∣jects with their Goods and Stock, from the Island of Anguilla, where they were miserably abused and destroyed, by some Irish which the French had put on Shore amongst them: Before, and during Sir Timothy's Stay in Antigua, the Indians of the Neighbouring Islands, who were in League with the French, land∣ed several times upon the said Island, killing those Inhabitants that lived near to the Sea, (to the Number of Ten) and then making their Escape in their swift Periaquas, notwithstanding the best Sailing Sloops were sent in pursuit of them; but by the Diligence of the Lieutenant General, in placing Guards at all the Bays and landing Places, those Incursions were afterwards prevented. About the middle of September, a French Privateer landing at Five Islands near Antigua, had taken off some Negroes; and in his going away met with two English Sloops, one of which after some Resistance he took; the other making her Escape, came in and gave an Account of the Action; upon which Sir Timothy sent out two Sloops, Man'd with a Company of Granadiers, under the Command of Captain Walter Hamilton, who next day brought her in with her Prize: On board the Privateer, (besides thirty French) were six Irish, who were tried by a Court Marshal, and four of them deservedly executed. At this time a dreadful Mortality raging in the Island of Nevis, especially among the Men which had reduced that Sex to a Moiety of its usual num∣ber; forced the Inhabitants to make their Addresses to Sir Timothy, (who now had received a Commission for Major General,) to bring his Regiment down thither for their Defence, their Island lying within two Leagues of St. Christophers, and in daily expectation of being attacked; the Major General weighing their Necessity, after the violence of the Distemper was abated, in the Month of November removed his Regiment thither, encamping them up∣on a commodious Plain, close adjoyning to a River. In the beginning of December, the Lieutenant General coming down to Nevis, called a General Council of War, in which it was determined, that the Major General with three hundred of his own Regiment, and two hun∣dred Nevisians should go down and attack St. Martins and St. Bartholomews, two Islands belonging to the Enemy, in which they reared considerable quan∣tities of Stock for the support and maintenance of other their Sugar Islands; in
order to which Expedition, the Major General on Sunday the 15th of the said Month, put his Forces on board the Vessels provided for them, (being one Brigantine, and nine Sloops,) and on Monday the 16th he himself imbar∣qued, and the Fleet set Sail for the said Islands. On Wednesday the 18th in the Morning, we past by St. Bartholomews, and about four in the Afternoon, be∣ing within four or five Leagues of St. Martins, we espied a small Sloop stand∣ing up towards us, but upon sight of us she tacked, and put into one of the Bays: When we came up with the Bay where she lay, the Major General sent one Lieutenant Dowden with three Files of Men in a Boat, to go up to her and board her, and if she were floating to bring her out; when the Boat was got near on Board, the Enemy who lay hid in the Bushes on each side, (the Bay being Land-lock'd) fired very thick upon them, forcing them to retreat, two of them being wounded. The Major General being very desirous to have the Sloop, after it was dark, sent thirty Men in four Boats and Canoes, under the Command of Captain Walter Hamilton, again to attempt the bring∣ing her out; but the Enemy discovered them, and fired hotly upon them; the Canoe which Captain Hamilton was in, rowed close up to the Sloop, and found her run on Ground, the Men being all gone out of her, so were forced to leave her, and return to their Vessels: Captain Hamilton received two Shots in one of his Legs, about four Persons more being wounded, but none killed; that Night we stood off and on, as though we designed to land in the Morning. The next Day being the 19th, there was a Council of War held by the Of∣ficers on board the Brigantine, wherein it was determined, first to attack St. Bartholomews, and accordingly the Sloops stood up in the Night to the said Island: The next Morning before Day, Major John Stanley landed with four∣score Men, notwithstanding the Opposition of the Enemy, and beat them out of their Breast-Works, and by break of Day he had planted his Colours up∣on a Battery they had, consisting of two great Guns: All the Forces being landed, the Major General ordered them to take three several Ways; him∣self leading his own Guard of Gentlemen Reformadoes, with two Companies more through the Body of the Island. After a Miles March, we discovered a large Fortification, which appeared to be well Mann'd; but the Major Gene∣ral running down bravely with his Men, so disheartned the Enemy, that after they had given us two or three Volleys, they quitted it, and fled into the Woods. The Fortification was quadrangular, consisting of about two Acres of Land, encompassed with double Rows of Stakes, six Foot high, and four Foot distant; the Intervals being fill'd with Earth, and a wide deep Trench without it; on each Corner there was a Flanker, in one of which was plant∣ed four great Guns; the Entrance into it was a Lock, admitting but one at a time; in the middle of it was the Governours House, and a Guard-House for the Souldiers; also a large Cistern with store of Water; seven or eight Barrels of dried Salt Fish, with Bread proportionable, and two Barrels of Powder: It was situate in a Bottom by the side of a Lane, through which we were to pass to come at it, and on the other side was a very high Hill. After we had entred it, the Major General sent this Relator with four Files of Men to gain the top of the Hill, which he did, finding it fortified with two great Guns loaden and primed, with the Match lighted, and several Bags of Partridge-Shot lying by them, but the Enemy was in so much hast, they did not stay to fire them upon us. About four Miles distant from the Fortification, upon the side of a Hill, there appeared a large white Building, resembling a Fort, to which the Major Ge∣neral sent three hundred Men under the Command of Colonel Charles Pym,
with Orders, if he found it strong, to sit down before it, and wait his com∣ing. About two of the Clock the Major General (leaving a sufficient Guard in the Fortification) marched up thither with the rest of his Forces, and when we came to it, we found it to be only a Stone Plat-form, laid shelving for the conveyance of the Rain Water into the Cistern; the Island being destitute of Rivers, Wells, or other Conveniencies of fresh Water, the Inhabitants are forced to make use of all Advantages to catch the Rain, each House being furnished with one or more of these Cisterns, some of them capable of hold∣ing twelve or fourteen Tuns. There we encamped that Night, and the next Day (the 21st) we marched back to the Fortification. On Sunday (the 22d) in the Morning, two Captains of the Enemy came in with a Flag of Truce, bringing Articles from their Governour, upon which they offered to surrender themselves; which, when the Major General had perused, he returned an Answer to him in writing, and also by two Gentle∣men who spoken French, which he sent to him, that his Terms were denied; but if he would come in with the Inhabitants, with their Arms and Ammu∣nition, within three Days, he should find him a Gentleman; but if he stood out longer, he was to expect no Quarter: That Night the Gentlemen return∣ed to the Camp with an Answer from the Governour, That on Wednesday he would come in, but he could not sooner, because some of the Inhabitants were hid in the Woods, to whom he could not communicate his Design be∣fore that time. On Monday and Tuesday (the 23d and 24th) we marched round the Island, burning all the Houses as we passed along; the Inhabitants in some places firing upon us from the Woods, but without any Damage. On Wednesday (the 25th) we espied a Flag of Truce coming toward us, with the Governour, and a great Company of the Inhabitants; upon which, the Major General having his own Company of Guards in the Fortification, and the rest of his Forces drawn up round it, sent the two Gentlemen who were before with him, to meet the said Governour, and at the Entrance into the Fortification, he was received by Lieutenant Colonel John Thomas, and by him conducted to the Major General, who sat in the House; (which ra∣ther resembled a Pigeon House, than a Governours Pavilion, as the French termed it; for it consisted only of one Room about twelve Foot square be∣low, and another above:) he was accompanied by a Frier, and some of his Officers, all which were received with great Civility by the Major General, and many Complements passed between them: After some Discourse they went to Dinner, and the Major General so well warmed the Frier with good Madera Wine, that he spoke Latin so fluently upon Transubstantiation, that he confounded himself in his own Argument. The Prisoners who came, in were between six and seven hundred, all which were transported, the Governour with the Men as Prisoners to Nevis, the Women and Children to St. Christo∣phers; all the live Stock was also carried up to Nevis, with the Negroes, Goods, &c. The Major General returned the Governour some of his Negroes, his Horse, Arms, Apparel, &c. to be carried for him to St. Christophers. In taking this Island we had about ten Men kill'd and wounded. While we were thus busied in sacking this Place, Colonel Hewetson landed with three hundred Antigua Men upon another Island belonging to the French, called Marigalanta, beating the Inhabitants into the Woods, burning their Town, nailing their Guns, demolishing their Fort, and returned to Antigua with the Plunder of their Island. During our stay upon St. Bartholomews, we had an addition of eight or nine
Sloops, with about fifty Men, from some of the Neighbouring, Islands, which the Major General made Advantage of; for on Sunday the 19th of January, he sent the Brigantine with nine Sloops, (the like number that had been there before) under the Command of Captain Walter Hamilton, to alarm the Island of St. Martins, and the next Morning to make a false Attack on the wind∣ward Side: After Captain Hamilton was gone down, the same Day the Major General embarqued with all his Forces in the other Sloops, and in the Night set Sail for the said Island, and the next Morning (the 20th) landed all his Men on the Leeward Side without any Opposition, the Enemy having drawn all their Forces to the other side of the Island; only after the first Company was landed, about twenty of the Enemy fired upon them from a Breas-wr▪ but they were soon beat out of it. When all the Forces were landed, they marched entire through the Body of the Country▪ and after two Miles march, were drawn up in convenient Plain, the Enemy being in sight, and as we thought advancing towards us: After we had continued an hour in this Posture, the Enemy retiring, had fired a great Building upon a Hill, about a Mile distant, which seem'd to be a Fortification; upon which, the Major Ge∣neral marched up to it with the whole Body, but found it to be only a large House, which they had burnt because it should not serve us for Shelter, but the Stone Walls, which remained standing, however proved serviceable to us, in covering us from their Shot. There was a large Cistern of Water, but they had rendred it unfit for drinking, by throwing Salt into it; a Pond also that was adjacent, they had poisoned with Tobacco. We had not been long here before the Enemy began to fire upon us from a Breast-work, where they had two great Guns planted upon a Hill a quarter of a Mile distant, there be∣ing a clear Valley between us; on the left hand low and bushy Ground, and on the right, a ridge of Mountains with a very thick Wood: The Major Ge∣neral sent Captain Burt with a Company of Men to gain the top of the highest Mountain, which had the Command of the Post we were at; which being done, he left an hundred Men under the Command of Captain Geoffery Gibb; to maintain that Post, and marched back into the Plain with the rest of his Forces to secure the Avenues, and hinder the Enemy from coming upon our Backs: Being come down into the Plain, himself, with several Officers, and about an Hundred Sentinels, went to drink at a Well, where, while they were drinking, they received a Volly of about thirty Shot from the Enemy, who lay hid in the Woods, but it pleased God though they stood close one by another, there was but one Man hurt. Withdrawing from thence, Major John Stanly was sent with a Party to rout them out of the Woods, which he did, beating them from strong Breast-works they had upon a Saddle between two Hills, (opposite to those we had before gained) in which Works he posted himself. The Passages being both ways secured, the Major General encamped with the Body in the middle of the Plain that Night, and the next Morning (the 21st) our two Brass Field-Pieces, with Carriages, and two Iron ones, without, were brought on Shore; the Iron ones were planted in the Plain, but the Brass were drawn up to the burnt House, where our Body was now encamped, and about three in the Af∣ternoon we began to play upon the Enemy. In the Evening Captain Bartholo∣mew Sharp was sent with one Company of Men to cut a Path through the Wood, that we might make an Attack upon the Enemy that way; for in the Valley they had four great Guns planted directly against the Road; but being without Carriages, they could not bring them to bear upon us as we lay: Captain Sharp had made no great Progress in his Work before he was disco∣vered,
and so hotly dealt with, that he was forced to retreat: All Day the Enemy kept firing upon us from their Breast-work, both with their great Guns and small Arms, but in the Night they silently quitted it. The next Morning, (the 22d) leaving thirty Men at the burnt House (under the Command of Lieutenant James Smith) we marched over to the Breast-work and demolished it, and also their Line, which run down to a Well in the Valley near their four great Guns, which we nailed, together with the other two above. Continuing our March about a Mile farther, we came to a fine Plain, encompassed with Orange and other Fruit-Trees, where we encamped, there being store of Cattle also grasing; at the upper end of it were three small Houses, in one of which were found Blood, and Dressings of some wound∣ed Men, and we understood by two Prisoners which we took presently after, that they had near twenty kill'd and wounded: The next Morning (the 23d) the Major General leaving this Relator with a sufficient Guard in the Plain, to take care of the Plunder; he marched with the Body against their chief Fort, about two Miles distant, which he took without any loss having but one Man wounded, the Enemy quitting their Fort after a small resistance: It consist∣ed of six great Guns mounted upon a Plat-form without Carriages, with Banks of Earth thrown up; after he had nailed and overthrown the Guns, he proceeded in his march about four Miles farther, and then encamped in a pleasant Valley, where was a House and Garden belonging to the Frier: there they found the Governour's Horse saddled and bridled, he having left him and fled into the Mountains with the Inhabitants: This Day Major John Stanly marched over the Hills on the other side the Island, and engaged a Party of the Enemy, beat∣ing them out of their Breast-work, and demolishing it; at Night he returned to his Post on the Saddle: (the 24th) the Major General continued his march round the Island without any opposition, and at Night returned to the burnt House, where he again encamped; the Plunder being also removed thither. On Saturday Morning, (the 25th) we saw three great Ships, a Brigantine and a Sloop standing in with the Island, and about Noon we understood by some Prisoners, which we took landing out of the said Sloop, that it was Mounsieur Decass come down from St. Christophers with seven hundred Men, to defend the Island against us, who they heard had been upon St. Bartholomews, and they thought us to be yet there: The Major General immediately commanded away Guards to all those Bays where he thought the Enemy would land; but they seeing our Sloops, perceived we were already upon the Island, and so came not to an Anchor, but gave Chase to our Sloops, who made the best of their Way to get clear; one of them in great danger of be∣ing taken, run her self on ground, but was again hal'd off by the Enemy, but the Men were all got out of her: The Master of one of the Sloops being at the Camp, when the Prisoners were brought up who gave this Account, the Major General dispatched him with an Express to Antigua, to acquaint the Lieutenant General with our Condition, and desire him to send some Ships to our Assistance. Decass stood off and on all night, and in the morning (the 26th) com∣ing close in with the Shore, he fired several Guns, to give the Inhabitants notice of his Arrival: About noon he came to an Anchor before the Wind∣ward part of the Island, hanging abroad bloody Colours. The Inhabitants, en∣couraged by the coming of these Ships, came down out of the Mountains, and finding their Fort unman'd, they again took possession of it, replanting and drilling their Guns. In the night Decass landed his Souldiers; which the Major General having advice of, brought his Brass Field-Pieces from the
Burnt-House into the plain, and planted them on the right and left Wing of the Body, which was there encamped; the Iron Pieces being planted before towards each Road, having placed strong Guards upon the Saddle, at the Burnt-House and the Mountain which commanded it: In this Posture of Defence, we continued the 27th 28th & 29, the Enemy not daring to attack us: They had now three Ships more come down from St. Christophers, which joyned with Decass. On Thursday (the 30th) in the Morning, arrived Collonel Hewetson from Antigua with three Ships, which the Lieutenant General had sent to our Assistance: The French Ships at an Anchor perceiving English Colours, weighed, and stood out to meet them; About Noon they engaged, and after four hours Dispute, with little damage on our Side, the French bore away, our Ships also standing off all night, but in the morning (the 31st) they returned: The French Ships also appeared in sight, but kept off at a distance: The Major General having sent the Plunder and Field-Pieces on Board, Or∣dered all his Out-Guards to quit their Posts, and march down into the Plain in Order to Imbarque; which the Enemy perceiving, marched down likewise, and both Parties engaged, to the great loss of the Enemy, who was beaten in∣to the Woods in Confusion: The Major General made an Honourable retreat, and Imbarqued safe with all his Men, except about ten who were kill'd in the whole Action, and three who were taken Prisoners, by being asleep in one of the Breastworks, when our Men quitted them: One of them made his Escape and got down to the Sea Side, and a Boat went and brought him off clear; the other two were afterwards exchanged: There were about twenty more wounded, which with the rest arrived safe at Nevis, on Sunday Morning the second of February. After the Major General's Regiment returned up to Nevis, the Inhabitants of the said Island considering the service they had done, and their Willing∣ness to continue in their defence, against the expected Assaults of a Neigh∣bouring Enemy; in the Month of April 1690. they allowed the said Regiment Pay, so to continue for six Months, except the English Fleet should arrive, and then to be allowed Pay but one Month after the Arrival of the said Fleet; Which hapned in June following, at which time, Preparations being made for an Expedition against St. Christophers, by all the Leeward Caribby Islands, they brought their Forces down to the Island of Nevis, which was appointed to be the place of General Rendevouz, it lying most Convenient for the said purpose; And upon Monday the 16th. of June 1690, by the Command of his Excellency Christopher Codrington, (who had now received a Commission from their Majesties King William and Queen Mary for Captain General and Comman∣der in chief of all their Leeward Caribby Islands) there was a general Muster in the Island of Nevis, of all their Majesties Forces raised for the said Expedition against St. Christophers, which according to the Muster Rolls given in, appeared to be as follows, viz.   Men In the Duke of Bolton's Regiment, under the Command of Lieutenant General Holt. 700 In Major General Thornhil's Regiment, under his own Comamnd. 500 In the Antigua Regiment, under the Command of Colonel Williams. Governour of the said Island, 400 In the Monserat Regiment, under the Command of Colo∣nel Blackstone Governour of the said Island. 300 In the two Nevis Regiments, under the Commands of Col∣lonel Pym, and Colonel Earl, 600
In the Marine Regiment, being a Detachment out of the Frigots, under the Command of Colonel Kegwin Com∣mander of the Assistance, 400 In the Captain General's Guard, under the Command of Colonel Byam. 100 In All 3000 Men Upon Tuesday and Wednesday, being the 17th and 18th of the said Month of June▪ we Imbarqued for the said Expedition; and upon Thursday the 19th we set Sail from Nevis with our whole Fleet, consisting of ten Men of War, two Fireships, twelve Merchant Men, and about twenty Brigantines and Sloops; and the same Evening, we came to an Anchor before the Island of St. Chri∣stophers in Frigot Bay: In the night eight of our Frigots weighed, and fell down three Leagues to Leeward, to amuse and harras the Enemy, and the next morning they returned: That day we plyed our great Guns from some of the Frigots, which lay neerest in with the Shore, upon the Enemy in their Trenches, and received some Shot in Exchange, from a Battery of five Guns they had there, but without any damage on our Side. That night there was a Council of War held on board the Admiral, by the General Officers and some of the prime Commanders, according to the Result of which, Major General Thornhil with four hundred of his own Regiment and a Detatchment of one hundred and fifty out of the Regiments of Mon∣serat, Nevis and Antigua, between two and three of the Clock the next morn∣ing, being Saturday the 21st, landed with the Forelorn (the Field∣mark being Matches about their left Arms (at the little Saltponds, about a League to Windward of the aforesaid Frigot Bay, without any Opposition; the Enemy having left that place ungarded by reason of it's Situation, it lying at the foot of an almost inaccessible Hill, over which they thought it an Impos∣sibility to march: This Steep Ascent we mounted by a Path frequented by none but wild Goats, and in some places so near a perpendicular, that we were forced to use our Hands as well as our Feet in climbing up. About break of Day we gained the top, where we received a Volly of about seven or eight Shot, from some Scouts there placed, (who immediately upon their firing retreated) which wounded us two brisk Commanders, one of which died of his Wounds soon after. The Major General leaving one Company to secure the Pass upon the Hill, led his Men down about a third part of it, before they were discovered by the Enemy, who now began to fire briskly upon us from their Trenches, wounding several of our Men, and the Major General him∣self received an unfortunate Shot through the small of his left leg, which obliged him to stay the binding of it up; but his Men running down briskly upon the Enemy, and Flanking them in their Trenches, and the Duke of Bolton's and the Marine Regiments landing at the same time at Frigot Bay, (in which Action Colonel Kegwin received a mortal wound) forced them to quit their Post in disorder and leave us masters of the Field: We found fourteen of them dead, we having lost half the number, besides wounded Men. All our Forces being landed, and the Major General with the wounded Men sent on board, the Army was drawn up into four Battalions: The Duke of Bol∣ton's Regiment in the Van, was Ordered to take the Road adjoyning to the Sea; The Major General's Regiment (under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel John Thomas) in the Body, was ordered to march through the Countrey, and the Anti∣gua Regiment was commanded to march at a distance, as a Reserve to the Body: The other four Regiments were to keep their Posts, & wait farther Orders. Af∣ter an hours march the Duke of Bolton's Regiment encountred a small party of the
Enemy, and soon put them to the rout; Immediately, after those French Companies which ran from Frigot Bay, joyning with the rest of their Forces, which were ga∣thered from all parts of the Island, were advancing upon our Body; they having much the Advantage of ground, and three to one in number; and after a Sharp dis∣pute of half an hour, they had almost surrounded us; but Colonel Williams com∣ing up with the Reserve, and giving them an unexpected and vigorous Assault, so encouraged the Major General's Regiment, that they pressed resolutely on, and beat the Enemy out of the Field in Confusion; one part flying to the Mountains, and the rest betaking themselves to the Fort, which formerly belonged to the English. Orders being sent to the four Regiments at Frigot Bay to march up, and the Duke of Bolton's Regiment also meeting us, the whole Army was drawn up into an entire Body, and the Souldiers were permitted to drink by Companies, at the adjacent Wells and Cisterns. While the Army was thus refreshing, the Cockswain of the Mary Frigot came with Advice to the Captain General that the Frigots having fallen down before the Town and Fort of Basterre, the Enemy after firing two or three Rounds, had struck their Flag, set their Town on Fire, and quitted it; (but by the Diligence of the Sea∣men who came on Shore from the Frigots, it was happily extinguished:) Upon which advice, the Captain General marched immediately away to the said Town, with intent to quarter the Army therein for that night; but the Enemy having left Store of Wines and other Liquors behind them, and he fearing the Disor∣ders it might breed amongst the Souldiers, altered his Resolutions, and only mak∣ing a halt there, and placing his own Company of Guards in the Mass-house, com∣manded the Army to march to the Jesuits Convent, lying about a Mile above the Town, where being again drawn up, and Orders given to lie by their Arms all night, Centries were placed, and some Parties sent to drive in Cattle, there being store of Flower, Bread, &c. in the Convent: The Night proved very wet, it rain∣ing without Intermission till Morning; but the Officers generously shared the Wea∣ther with the Sentinels, scarce any, except the General Officers, going into the Convent for Shelter. The next morning (being Sunday the 22d) the Commissary General having se∣cured the Liquors in a convenient Store-house, the Army marched down to the Town, and free liberty was granted them to plunder it; Wine and Brandy being also distributed to them, by the respective Commissaries of each Regiment; The Fort here consisted of Sixteen Guns, which they had nail'd and spik'd, but by the diligence of our Men, they were again cleared. In the Afternoon, a Detachment of one hundred and fifty Men out of the Antigua Regiment, was sent under the Command of Major Gunthorpe, to gain and secure a Pass, which was thought to be possessed by the Enemy, lying in the way to the English Fort; but when they came, the found it quitted. Monday (the 23d) we continued all Day in the Town; and in the Evening the Country was in flames all round, being Fired by the En∣glish Negroes who came from the Mountains, where they had lain since their Masters the English were beaten off the Island. On Tuesday the 24th. We began our march towards the Fort, and that Night encamed about three M les from it, having the like ill Fortune of rainy Weather, without any means o avoid it. This day the Frigots weighed from Basterre, & fell down to Old Rd▪ ere they came agin to an Anchor: Wednesday the 25th, We continued our camp at Old Road, and the Wheelbarrows, Shovels, Pickaxes &c. were brought on Sh: On Thursday Morning (the 26th) We marched within a Mile of the Fort and encamped under the Covert of a high Hill, a Detachment out of Colonel Rgent being sent under the command of Captain Wil∣liam Butler t seure the top of it. On Fryday (the 27th) the Mary's two Chase-Guns (Six Pounders) were brought on Shore, in order to be drawn up to the top of the Hill, and the Marine Regiment
under the Command of Colonel Kirby, Commander of the Success, (Collonel Keg∣win being dead of his wound he received in landing) was imployed in cutting and clearing a patch, for the drawing them up. On Saturday and Sunday (the 28th and 29th) the Marine Regiment so vigorously pursued their business, that they had drawn the Guns to the top of the Hill, and planted them upon a Platform they had laid for them, with Baskets of Earth thrown up for a Covering from the Enemies Shot, it lying open to the Fort: On Monday morning (the 30th) Powder Shot &c. being carried up, they began to play upon the Fort, the very first Shot doing Exe∣cution, and the Frigots also weighing from Old Road, stood down to the Fort and battered against it; the whole Army at the same time marching into a deep and wide Ditch, between the Hill and the Fort, within Musket Shot of it: In the Af∣ternoon the Frigots stood up again to Old Road, but the Guns from the Hill kept playing incessantly till Night, at which time we began our Intrenchments, running (from the Ditch where we lay encamped) a Trench, with a Half Moon at the End, capable of holding four hundred Men. On Tuesday the first of July, one of the Nevis Regiments and part of the Antigua Regiment, were sent under the Command of Colonel Charles Pym, to take a small Fort of the Enemies about three Miles distant from the Camp, which they succes∣fully surprized, taking about fifty Prisoners in it. This Evening, Lieutenant General Holt having given Orders to the Out-Centries which were placed towards the Fort, to fire without Challenging at any who should come that way; himself afterwards riding by them in the twilight to view the Works, was Shot into the Body by one Gibbins an Irishman, who was one of the Centries, he returned to the Camp and languished long of it with little hopes of recovery: Gibbins was afterwards tried by a Court Marshal, but after a full hearing acquitted. On Wednesday (the 2d) those Guns on the Hill proving so serviceable, there were four more of a larger size drawn up; but one of them splitting at the first time of firing, and the rest being incommodiously planted, they were no more made use of. This day four Companies of the Enemy marched out of the Fort, and drew up before the Gate, but in a quarter of an hour they marched in again. The Half Moon being now finished, we run another Trench about a quarter of a Mile below it, able to contain the like number of Men; and at the like Distance below that we began another, wide enough to draw the Carriages of the great Guns through: the 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th Days, we continued in the day time quiet in our Trenches, in the night running on with our works; the Enemy firing day and night upon us with great Guns and small Arms, but doing us little damage, but the Guns on the Hill galled them exceedingly, leaving no Corner of the Fort unsearched. Some hundreds of the Enemy being out in the Mountains, headed by one Mon∣sieur Pinelle, Parties were sent daily abroad (commanded by the Officers in their turns) to scour them out; and on Monday the 7th the Major General (his Wound being well healed) went himself at the head of two hundred Men, upon the same Design; but could not meet with the Enemy to engage them, they lurking some∣times in one place, sometimes in another: On Wednesday (the 9th) he returned to the Camp, with some Prisoners, many Negroes, and great Store of Cattle. After the Major Generals return, Proclamation being made, by beat of Drum, in several places of the Island, by the Command of the Captain General, that all which would come in within three Days, should receive his Protection to secure their Persons from the Outrages of the Souldiers; several Families surrendred themselves, to ma∣ny of which was also granted Liberty to return to their Houses, and keep some small stock till farther Orders. Monsieur Pinelle also sent in a Flag of Truce from the Mountains, to acquaint the Captain General that he could not come in without leave from the Governour; but however he assured him, he would remain quiet, and give free passage to any of our Men he should meet with: The 10th and 11th we continued in our Trenches, which we had now run within Pistol Shot of the Fort.
Over against the Gate we had an half Moon, on which we planted several Co∣lours: On the left hand of the Half-Moon was a Battery raised for six great Guns, (two eighteen Pounders and four twelve Pounders) but before they were mount∣ed, on Saturday the 12th, about one in the Afternoon, the Drums beat a Parly in the Fort, & four Persons marched out with a Flag of Truce; they were met in the Pasture between our Trench and the Fort, by Major Legard, and by him conducted to the Captain General; and after some Treaty, Hostages were given on both sides, one of the Majors continuing with us, and Lieutenant Colonel Not was sent to them; Captain Hamilton also going with him as an Interpreter: But notwithstand∣ing the Treaty, the Captain General continued his workds, joyning our Trench to the Enemies Trench, through which they used to come from the Fort to the Well: Our Centries were placed under the Walls, and at the Gate of the Fort, and that Evening our Guns were also mounted upon the Battery. About twelve of the Clock in the Night there was a Canoe let over the Fort Walls, (it being situate by the Sea-side) which run on board a Sloop that came close in with the Shore, under the Covert of the dark Night; our Men let Fly a whole Volly upon them, which made them hasten away. Captain Hamilton came to the Centry at the Fort Gate, and Ordered him to acquaint the Major General, that there was a Ship seen off, upon which this Relator was dispatched away to Old Road, to give Admiral Wright notice of it, but in the interim a Brigantine was sent in pursuit of the Sloop; the Admiral immediately ordered two Frigots to weigh, and put out in search of the said Ship and Sloop, which they did, and the next Day the 13th they returned without seeing any Vessels. During the whole Action upon this Island, there were two Frigots that cruised about, to take any French Vessels which might arrive there, either by design or chance, but they met with none: On Monday the 14th, the Fort was surrendred to the Cap∣tain General, upon the same Articles that it was before delivered up to the French. After the Enemy marched out, & the English Flag was put up, the King's & Queens Healths were drank, and the great Guns three times fired, three Vollies being also made by the whole Army. The Fort was Quadrangular, consisting of four Flankers, with a Curtain between each; on each Flanker were mounted five Guns; the Walls, were of Stone, about twenty Foot high, surrounded with a deep Ditch twelve Foot wide, over which was a narrow wooden Bridge. In the middle of the Fort were two Mounts thrown up for Batteries; there was also a Well, but upon firing the Guns, the Water would instantly dry away: There was Store of Provision, Li∣quors and Powder, but they wanted Shot. In retaking this Island we had about an hundred Men killed and wounded; the Island in general is very Strong, there being several small Fortifications, and Breast∣works all round, except where it is naturally fortisied with Hills or Shoals. The In∣habitants were about eighteen hundred Men, besides Women and Children and Ne∣groes, all which (except the Negroes which were to be divided▪ as plunder) were transported to the Island of Hispaniola; only some particular Persons had the favour granted them to be carried up to Martineco. After a Weeks Refreshment, the Major General on Sunday the 20th of the said Month of July, Imbarqued with his own Regiment in the Sloops, and the Marine Regiment on board the Frigots, and set sail for the Island of St. Eustace; and the same Evening lying before the said Island, he sent Captain Hamilton on Shoar with a Flag of Truce, to Summons the Island to surrender, who returned with an answer from the Governour, that he would defend it to the utmost; the next Morning (the 21st) the Frigots began to Batter against the Fort, and the Major General landed at the same time with his Men under a high Cliff, which they ascended; being got up, they had not marched far, before they perceived some Dutch Colours in the Woods, upon which a Party was sent to discover them, who returned with an Account, that it was Colonel Scorer (the Governour of the Island for the Dutch,
when the French took it) with one hundred Men under his Command, who came from Saba, and landed there three days before, but not having strength enough to take the Fort, (into which the Inhabitants were fled) he designed to get what Plunder he could, and so go off again: He refused to joyn with the Major General, because he was first landed, & so accordingly went off the next day. The Major Ge∣neral proceeded in his march towards the Fort, and encamped within Musket Shot of it, under the rising of a small Hill; the next day the Marine Regiment landed, and the Shovels, Pickaxes, &c. being brought on Shore, they began their Intrench∣ments, running their Trench along by the Fort, within Musket Shot of it. After five Days siege, the Enemy sent out a Flag of Truce with Articles, but they were so high in their demands, that the Major General refused them, and re∣turned an answer; if they did not descend to more reasonable terms within three days, he would grant them no Quarter. Within the prescribed time they came out again with a Flag of Truce, and surrendred themselves and their Fort upon Quar∣ter for life, & to march out with their Baggage: Their Fort contained sixteen great Guns, it was surrounded with double Rows of Stakes, the Intervals fill'd with Earth, and without that strong Pallisadoes, and on the outside of them a deep Ditch, over which was a very narrow Bridge leading into the Gate, admitting but one at a time; the Besieged were about sixty men, (the Women and Children being sent off some time before) they had a Well for Water, and about twenty Barrels of Flower, some Salt-Fish and Pork, and a small Quantity of Ammunition; they behaved themselves very briskly during the siege, especially the Governour, who was very active in firing the great Guns, &c. In taking this Island, we had not above Eight Men kill'd and wounded: The Ma∣jor General leaving one Company upon the Island, under the Command of Lieutenant John Mack-Arthur, returned to St. Christophers with the whole Fleet, carrying the Inhabitants Prisoners thither, and afterwards transporting them to Hispaniola. Lieu∣tenant Pilkinton was afterwards sent down with a Company out of the Duke of Bolton's Regiment, to relieve Lieutenant Mack-Arthur, and he still continues there for the Defence of the said Island. The Inhabitants of the Island of St. Bartholomews, who were brought up Priso∣ners from thence to Nevis, being sent down to St Christophers, before that Island was retaken, there met with their Wives and Families; and after that Island was re∣taken, they were desirous to live under an English Government, upon which the Captain General gave them Liberty, to return to their Island, transporting them thither, and granted a Commission to one Captain le Grand a former Inhabitant among them, to be their Governour, and to keep and defend the Island in the name and behalf of their Majesties King William and Queen Mary, under which Government it still continues. In the latter end of October, this Relator's Concerns calling him home to Eng∣land, he left the Caribby Islands; the Captain General having then issued out Orders for the mustering their Majesties Forces, and getting them in a readiness to Im∣barque upon a farther Expedition against Guadalupe and other French Islands, leaving a Garrison upon St. Christophers, under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel Not. Thus you have a brief and plain Relation of the Success of the English Arms in the Caribby Islands, and it may reasonably be concluded, that as the English Affairs there have hitherto been happily prosperous, so (being under the management and Con∣duct of such prudent and active Generals, and promoted by the forwardness of the Souldiery, but principally by a Divine Blessing attending upon their Endeavours) they will soon put a succesful Period to those troublesome Wars, and root the French Interests out of that part of the World. FINIS.
