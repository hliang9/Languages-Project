royal blazon or coat of arms ❧ By the King. ¶ A second Proclamation for the apprehension of Richard Smith, a Popish Priest, stiled, and calling him∣selfe, The Bishop of Calcedon. WHereas by Our Proclamation, bearing date the eleuenth day of December last past, (for the reasons in that Our Proclamation expressed) Wee did straitly commaund, that none of Our Subiects should harbour or conceale the sayd Smith, but that foorthwith they should arrest and apprehend his bodie, and bring him before the next Iustice of Peace, to the place where hee should bee apprehended, whom Wee thereby comman∣ded to commit him to prison without Bayle or Maineprise, and presently to enforme Vs, or Our Priuie Counsell, of his apprehension: And Wee did thereby declare, That if any person should then after, directly or indirectly, harbour or conceale the sayd Smith, or vse, or conniue at any meanes, whereby the sayd Smith might escape from beeing apprehended or ar∣rested, that Wee should extend the vttermost seueritie of Our Lawes against euery such of∣fender, as by Our Proclamation more at large appeareth; Which Our Proclamation hath not yet wrought that good effect which Wee expected, the sayd Smith beeing still hidden and harboured by those, who, beeing infected and blinded with Popish superstition, preferre their respects to him, before their duetie to Vs, and the feare of Our high displeasure, and the con∣sequence thereof; Wee therefore, by the aduice of Our Priuie Counsell, haue thought fit by this Our second Proclamation to renew Our former command in that behalfe. And to the end that none of Our Subiects may hereafter excuse themselues by a preten∣ded ignorance of the danger they shall fall into, if they shall harbour or conceale him; Wee doe hereby publish and declare, That the sayd Smith is not onely a Popish Priest, and with a high presumption taketh vpon him to exercise Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, pretended to bee de∣riued from the Sea of Rome, within this Our Realme, and endeauoureth to seduce Our Subiects from the true Religion established in the Church of England, (which, by Gods assi∣stance Wee shall euer constantly maintaine) but doeth also seditiously and traiterously hold correspondence with Our enemies, tending to the destruction of Our State. And therefore Wee doe now againe renew Our former command for his apprehension, and doe hereby further signifie, That whosoeuer shall Lodge, Harbour, or Relieue the sayd Smith, or any other Priest, Iesuite, or other, hauing taken Orders by authoritie pretended to bee deriued from the Sea of Rome, shall incurre the danger of Our Lawes made against the Harbourers, Lodgers, and Relieuers of Priests, to the full extent thereof, which by the Statutes of this Our Realme is Felonie. And Wee doe further hereby declare, (which Wee shall really performe) That whosoeuer shall discouer the sayd Smith, and cause him to bee apprehended, as aforesayd, shall haue a re∣ward of one hundred pounds in money, to bee presently payd vnto him by Vs, and shall also haue the benefit of all such Penalties and Forfeitures, which shall or may accrue vnto Vs, and bee forfeited by that person, in whose house the sayd Smith shall bee found to haue beene harboured or concealed. And Wee further charge and command heereby, (as by Our former Proclamation Wee did) all and singuler Our Iudges, Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Shiriffes, Constables, and all other Our Officers, Ministers and louing Subiects, That if they shall finde any person of∣fending herein, that then they, and euery of them, proceede with all diligence and readi∣nesse, not onely against the sayd Smith, but also against all such as shall harbour, conceale, or conniue at his concealement, or shall not vse their best endeauours for his discouery and appre∣hension, according to the vttermost extent of Our Lawes. Giuen at Our Court at Whitehall,  the foure and twentieth day of March, in the fourth yeere of Our Reigne, of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Prin∣ters to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. M.DC.XXVIII.
