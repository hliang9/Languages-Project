The preface of Alexander Barclay preest / vnto the right hye and mighty prince: Thomas duke of Northfolke. RIght myghty hye / & magnificent prince: myne humble seruyce / due vnto your grace. And the vehe∣mēt affection whiche I ha∣ue vnto your honour & per∣petual fame / impelleth me often tymes to deuyse / and reuolue in mynde: what seruice or pleasur my simplenesse might do / cōuenient and acceptable vnto your hygh∣nesse: therby to testify the honour / the loue / & obsequy: whiche I knowlege my selfe to owe vnto your magnificēce. But whan I cōsyder
and compare my symplenesse and impotence with your preeminēt dignite: I fynde myselfe gretly insufficiēt to parforme or attempt any besynesse or warke which I may condynglie present vnto your honorable presēce. Neuer∣theles after many cōsyderaciōs: the gracious regarde of benynge grauite which I beholde in your coūtenance: and the euident signes of humilite whiche outwardly apereth radicae in your noble hert: reconforteth myne insuffi∣cience & inboldeth my spirites / some thyng to write my custome whiche I may present into your gracious handes: as a perpetual memo¦rial: an and euident testimony of my deuout seruice / & amorous affection against your ma¦gnificent hyghnes. In this consyderacion I haue reuolued many & diuerse volumes / stu∣dyeng of which one: the trāslacion: might cor¦respond with your noble estat. But at last I haue remēbred that a mercyal matter is most cōgruent vnto a marcial & victorious prince. Wherfore I haue attempted to translate into our maternal langage the auncient cronicle & famous hystorie of the warre: and dyuers ba∣tayls which the romayns dyd agaynst the ty∣ran Iugurth: vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy. Whiche hystorie is writen in latyn by the ronowmed romayne Salust: whose wordes in latyn I haue also added vnto the marge of this my trāslacion to thintent that such as shal dysdayne to rede my translation in englysshe: may rede this hystorie more cō∣pendyously & more obscurely writen in laten. Which hystorie: parauenture shal apere more clere & playne vnto theym in many places by help of this my trāslation. Which shal nat be tedyous to such as be lerned & vndestande la∣tyn: but vnto many noble gentylmen whiche vnderstande nat latyn tong {per}fetly I dout nat but that this my labour shalbe both pleasure & profet. For by the same they shal haue some help toward the vnderstādyng of latyn: whi∣che at this tyme is almost contēned of gentyl∣men. And also they shal vnderstande a ryght fruytful hystorie: bothe pleasant / profitable / &
ryght necessary vnto euery degre: but special∣ly to gentylmen / whiche coueyt to attayne to clere fame and honour: by glorious dedes of chyualry. But I dout nat: but that some ca∣lumnyous detractours shal maligne agaynst this my besynes and {pro}fitable labour / sayeng that to a preest and man {pro}fessed to obseruāce of religion: it is farre cōtrary & dysagreynge to intermyt hymselfe with warfare: or to in∣termyt with thyng{is} of batayle: outher by de∣des / counsel / or writynge. But to stoppe the mouthes of such calumniatours: moost soue∣rayne prince: mesemeth ryght & cōuenient in this place: somwhat to write aswel cōcernyng the cōmodities & laudes of hystories: as aper∣tenent vnto myne owne excusacion. And first I knowlege it moch more cōueniēt: a preest to arme hymselfe with constance / holy scripture / purenesse of lyfe / & radyant vertues: and with suche socours & armour defended: boldely / & valiātly / to byd batayle agaynst vycs: to pur¦sue the obstinate synners of this worlde. And to cōtende also agaynst the temptaciōs of his carnal cōcupiscēces / agaynst these mundayne blandimētes & delectacions: and agaynst his gostely ennemies suggestyōs. For vnder this maner (as affermeth the holy man Iob) man¦nes lyfe vpon yerth is but a warfare / & a very mase of miseries: an inricate circuite of vary able / and ineuitable errours. For certayne I deny nat: but that such ought to be the warfa∣re of a man within holy orders: auowed & sub¦myt vnto ye holy minysteries & auters of god. But this other temperal warre is permytted vnto wordely lyuers: and may nat be omyt∣ted: namely in this worlde oppressed with ty∣rāny of iniuryous and odyous exactors and oppressours: whose obstinate presumpcions / assautes / & inuasions can nat otherwyse be re¦pressed: than by violence / armour / & batayle: vnder ministracion of good and ryghtwyse princes defenders & mayntayners of the com∣men wele. Than it is lauful: a preest to write suche actes for example of our posterite: for perpetual remembraūce of the laudes of good
princes / which haue ben here in erth the scour¦ges of god to correct tyrannes & synners. But great is the laude & many be the cōmodities & vtilities of hystories. An hystore is the recor∣der of tymes passed: the lyght of verite: the maistres of mannes lyueng: the presydent of memorie: the messanger of antiquite. And (as Titus Liuius recordeth in his prologue) the knowledge of hystories among other thinges is most holsome / necessary / and {pro}fitable. For euery good example which in them is writen: is set for a warnyng & monycion vnto princes and gouernours therby to rule & order them∣selfe: & a cōmen wele. And euery exāple of mi∣serable fortune of tyrannes / is set as a monici∣on for the same gouernours nat to be of tyran∣nous behauour / lest at last they may fal īto ly∣ke miserable ruyne & calamite. And also (as sayth Cicero) a man to knowe nothing of that which was done before his tyme & remēbran∣ce: that is as who sayth alway to be a chylde. But it is a thyng very comely: & necessary be∣fore other: to knowe these cronycles & noble actes of aunciēt tyme & remēbrance to kepe in mynde the order & courses of antiquite: and to haue in mynd the knowledge of exemples for euery mater & purpose. For in likewyse as vn∣to aged men is more credence & auctorite gy∣uen / than to yong men: bycause of experiēce of many thyng{is}. So such noble & diligēt mynd{is} as delyteth in redynge hystories: may haue knowlege nat onely of the dedes of one man∣nes lyfe: but also of the dedes most famous of al tymes syth creation of the world. Wherfor (as sayth Dyodorus) it is a comely & fayre thyng / moche necessary & cōmendable: a man to refourme & amende his lyfe / by example of an other mannes faut{is} & dāmages. Wherfore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned & counselled the kyng Ptolomy to excercise hymselfe in often redyng of bokes of hystories. For in so doynge: princes shall fynde writen in bokes before their eyen ryght many thyng{is} cōcernyng their wele / honour / & fame: which their frend{is} dare nat be bolde to
tell them for drede of dysplesure: fathermore without the knowlege of hystories neuer man coude become good oratour. For (as affer∣meth Quintilian) hystories be of such myght and effect that they may norisshe the speche of an oratour withsoft and swete lycour. These premisses with otherlyke consydered: moost magnificent prince: me thinketh it thing nat inconuenient a preest to write of hystories of warre: and also me thynke both plesant & pro∣fitable to noble men to exercyse themselfe in re¦dyng the same. For brefely to speke by ryght∣wysie batel: the lawes of god & man be men∣tayned: vice & vicious men corrected: vertue / and good men rewarded and exalted. Oure fayth agaynst infideles defended: rebellers & tyrannes subdued: and finally all thyng{is} dire∣cted & to due order reduced. Fathermore the sa¦me redyng of hystores semeth to auayle nat a lytel to the knowledge & cōtempt of this tran∣sytorie pleasure mundayne & mysery of this vncertayne lyfe. For whan hystories represēt before our syght the valyant and bolde herted knyghtes shyning in armour: & richely apa∣relled: on comely coursers arded & trapped with golde & syluer: the goodly order & ordy∣nance of a great army of armed mn shyning in harnesse: fyers / & prepared redy to batayle: the trumpettes souning: the golden stremers and standerdes blasyng & glisteryng agaynst the sonne: and brefely all the grounde ouerco∣uerd with men & riches. What els is all this: but a vayne ostētation of yertly opulence: and caduke glorie prepared besely / assembled la∣boriously / and exposed folysshly & furiously vnto distruction & {per}dicion. But agayn anon after: whan we rede & se in the same hystories the valiaūt mennes bodyes prostrate: the car∣kases of kynges / dukes / erles / knyghtes / and pages mengled all togyder: all pride & conten¦cion abated. The bryght harnesse dyed with blode: the wounded coursers drawynge after them the deed bodyes of their lordes: the men cryeng: the tentes & townes brennyng. What is all this sight wt otherlyke? Forsoth nought
els but an euident spectacle of mannes brutall crudelite: and an exāple of mundayne vanite: declarynge the immoderat & insaciable desyre of dominion of yerthely princes: and prouing that vnto man welth is intolerable / & cōfoun∣ded by his owne foly. These manyfolde and holsome exāples: represented before our sight by reding of cronycles: hath moued my mynd to trāslate this present hystorie forth of latyn into our maternal langage. But among all other noble men of this region: most hye and myghty prince: ye seme vnto me most worthy and cōueniēt: to whose grace I shuld decycat this hystorie: bothe for myne owne duety to be obserued anenst your magnifycence: and also for the excellent worthynesse of your merites & great polycie of chyualry / whiche lately haue apered in you whyle ye nat with lesse wysdōe / than valyantyse haue vaynquysshed the inua¦sour and violent ennemy of the cōmen wele of England. In whiche noble & glorious acte ye haue {pro}ued your selfe lyke vnto myghty Ma∣rius. But this I omytte: as thynge euidently knowen to euery man: lest I myght seme ra∣ther to recoūt these your strong dedes for adu¦lacion: than for true relation. Wherfore most myghty & magnifycent prince: pleas it your hyghnesse of gracious beniuolence to accepte this smal present / trāslated by yor beedman to pleasure & profet of al gentylmen of this regi∣on: but namely of your hyghnes & of the noble men of your {pro}geny & affynite. But to thintent that this my small gyft somwhat may be augmented: my selfe / my seruyce / and prayer: I offre withall vnto your hygnes. ¶Thus endeth the preface of this present cronycle: by Alexander Bar∣clay preest / dyrect vnto the ryght hye and myghty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
¶Here begynneth a compendyous extracte / contaynyng breffely the effecte and processe of this present cronycle / compyled in latyn by the famous Romayn Salust. And trāslated into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest / at cōmaundement of the ryght hygh & myghty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke. IN this present cronycle or hystory of Rome: is written the batayle / whiche the Romayns had with Iugurth / vsurper of the kyngdome of Numydy. The lande of Numydy is parte of the countrey of Affryke. In whiche raygned somtyme a kynge named Massinissa: felowe and frende to the empyre of Rhome. This Massinissa had thre sonnes thus named: Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa. But after the deth of Manastabal and Galussa: the first brother named Micipsa / obtayned the kyngdome of Numydy alone / without partyner. For after the custome of Numydy / heritages are wont to be deuided among brethern by equal porcions / after dyscease of theyr parentes / of whome suche heritage issueth. This Micipsa so crowned kynge of hole Numydy had two sonnes / the first called Adherbal / the seconde Hiempsall. But his brother Manastabal whiche was departed before / left behynde hym one bastarde sonne named Iugurth: to whom his grand∣father Massinissa bequethed none heritage / but left hym priuate without lande or lyuelodde / for asmoche as he was vnlaufully borne. The kynge Micipsa was moued with pyte & compassyon agaynst this Iugurth: and cōsideryng that he was his brothers sonne / & without conforte / receyued hym into his house / and che∣risshed hym in all thynges / as he dyde his owne sonnes. This Iugurth as he grewe in stature / so grewe he in all gyftes belon∣gynge to nature / and became a right strong & hardy knyght / and also more excellent in wysdome / than in courage or myght / and was moche elder than the two sonnes of Micispa: named Adher ball & Hiempsall. What tyme Micipsa cōsydered the ouryng age manlynes / & wysdome of Iugurth. And on the other parte / whan he remēbred the feble yongth & vnexpert of his owne two sonnes in this aduisemēt his mynde was sore troubled wt drede: est after his dethe / the same Iugurth myght inuade and vsurpe vnto hymselfe the kyngdome of Numydy his owne two sonnes
beyng nat of power to defende thēselfe. Micipsa after these thyn¦ges cōsydred: determined to obiect this Iugurth vnto paryll of warre / and by such meanes to assay if it might fortune hym to be slayne in batell. Therfore what tyme ye romains hauyng Sci∣pio for their capitaine / beseged the cyte of Numance: this Mici∣psa sent vnto the romains to ye same batayle great socours both of horsmen and of fotemen. And made Iugurthe captayn ouer them. This dyde he trustynge that it was possible and lykely ynough that this Iugurth a knyght yonge / lusty / and desirous of honour / myght by some chaūce of fortune be slayne in batayle / as I sayd before. But at conclusion it fortuned moche contrary. For the boldnesse and strength of Iugurthe in that warre was well proued and knowen. For many noble and valiant actes of chyualry dyd he: wherby he wanne moche laude and glory / with great loue & fauour / nat onely of Scipio the captaine / but also of all the noblest men of the Romayne army. Insomoche that after this warre was fynisshed: and the cyte of Numance distroyed the captaine Scipio assembled his hole army: and before them all with magnificent and fauorable wordes cōmended Iugurth with merueylous laudes. This done he rewarded hym with ma¦ny & riche gyftes of chyualry. And sent hym agayne to the kynge Micipsa with letters / wherin also he commended this Iugurth with great laude and praysyng. By instigacion of whiche thyn∣ges it so befell: that where as the kyng Micipsa / nat long before desyred nothyng more than ye deth of Iugurth: nowe he coueted nought somoche as conseruacion of his lyfe & helth. So that nat long after he adopted hym as his sonne / and ordayned in his te∣stamēt hym to be one of his heyres & partiner of his kyngdome with his two other naturall sonnes. Whiche ordinaūce he neuer chaunged / but at his departyng increased his fauour and bene∣fites agaynst ye same Iugurth / leauynge hym nat onely partiner of his kyngdome / but also of all his treasours. And besyde this decryed hym to be protectour of his two naturall sonnes / and of theyr porcions of the kyngdome. Sone after this ordinaūce the kyng Micipsa departed frō lyfe. But whan ye thre princes Ad∣herball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth determined amonge them the tyme whan the treasoure shulde be deuided and the boundes of the kyngdome lymited to them eche one his parte. At this assem¦ble grewe a dissencion betwene Hiempsall & Iugurth / by occa∣syon wherof Iugurth shortely after slewe Hiempsall by treason and gyle. After this Hiempsall was slayne Iugurthe fixed his mynde to possesse the hole kyngdome of Numidy. Wherfore he
prepared a great & strong army agaynst the other brother Ad∣herball / and at last whan bothe mette in batayle the army of Ad∣herball was ouerthrowen / and hymselfe put to flyght. Adherball thus ouercome and spoyled of his kyngdome fledd vnto Rome / and there before the senatours declared the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth agaynst hym cōmitted / and agaynst his brother Hiem¦psall cruelly murdred: desiryng socours of the same senatours / wt pytefull wordes and lamentable complayntes. At conclusion it was decreed of the senatours / that .x. noble men of Rome shulde be sent embassadours to Numydy / to deuyde the kyngdome be∣twene Adherball and Iugurth indifferētly. The same embassa¦dours hasted them to Numydy / and dyde the cōmaundement of the senate to them inioyned: but more to the fauour of Iugurth / than Adherball. Whan the kyngdome was departed and deui∣ded / and the sayd embassadours were also departed from Affrke towarde Rome: Iugurth sette his mynde yet ones agayn to in∣uade and vsurpe the part of ye kyngdome which belonged to Ad / herball / by assignemēt of the embassadours. Wherfore he assem¦bled a newe army / and with the same īnuaded his kyngdome: Adherball compelled by necessite assembled also an other army for his part / and proceded forthe and mette with Iugurth. But anone after they ioyned batayle / Iugurth ouerthrewe the hoost of Adherball & put hym to yght / cōstrainyng hym to fle with a fewe horsmen about hym into a walled towne nere by / named Cyrtha. Iugurth anone beseged the towne on all partes. In the meane tyme Adherball by letters certified ye senatours of Rome in what state Iugurth had brought hym. How he was bereft of his kyngdome by crueltie & ambicion of Iugurthe: how he was brought to extremite by hunger and force of armes / nat able to abyde the besegynge any lenger: how it appered euidently that Iugurth set lytell by the decrees & ordinaunce of the senatours / And at conclusion of the same letters he humbly besought the se∣nate of ayde and socours in this his extremite. Whan these let∣ters were redde before the senatours assembled: many of them were: which iuged it thynge expedient and conuenient: to socour Adherball. And anone to sende an army into Affrike agaynst Iugurthe. But his frendes whome he hadde bought for money at Rome: made suche resistence that no suche ordinaunce coude come to effect / nor passe forthe agaynst hym. Neuerthelesse newe embassadours were sent ones agayne to Iugurth / and that men auncient and of great authorite: to compell and cōmaunde hym in name of the senatours to desyst from his entreprise and cruel∣tie
in payne of theyr hye displeasure. Iugurth blynded these im∣bassadours with fayre wordes and rewardes / tyll they were de∣parted agayn from Numidy to Rome / wtout any thing brought to ende. Whan this was knowen at Cirtha  where Adherball lay beseged: they whiche were with Adherball within the towne counselled hym to yelde vp the towne to Iugurth / vpon cōdicion onely to haue his lyfe pardoned vnto hym. Adherball constrai∣ned by famine and other necessities condiscended to this coun∣sell. But anone after the towne was yelded / Iugurth cōtrary to his fayth & promes which he had made to Adherbal: slewe hym with greuous & horrible tourmēt. Whan this dede was knowen at Rome: the senatours were sore moued agaynst hym. And toke his demeanoure and dedes inhumayne greuously. Wherfore by commen assent of the senatours and commens of Rome: one na∣med Licius Calphurnius that tyme consull of Rome / was sent with a strong army into Numidy agaynst Iugurth. But with in shorte season this Calphurnius corrupted and accloyed with money by Iugurth made a foule bonde of peace wt hym to great dishonoure and shame bothe of hymselfe  and of all the empire of Rome: for which dede the senatours and commens of Rome were greuously displeased. Wherfore Calphurnius was called home agayne to Rome with great dishonoure and rebuke. Af∣ter this Calphurnius / an other romayn named Albinus was elect consull and dyrect with newe supplemēt of warriours into Numidy agaynst Iugurth. But this Iugurth droue hym forth vnder hope and coloure as if he wolde yelde hymselfe to the sayd Alinus: so longe tyll at last the tyme approched of election of newe consuls. Wherfore Albinus of necessite constrayned: and as decrees of the romayns commaunded: retourned agayne to Rome to be at the sayd election (as he was bounde) without any dede laudably done in Numidy. And at his departinge left be∣hynde hym in Numidy his brother named Aulus: to be captayn in his stede / & ruler of his army / and also of the prouince where the same army soiourned tyll the wynter were ouer passed. What tyme Albinus was departed towarde Rome: this Aulus blynded by rasshenes and foly / behaued hymselfe ryght vndi∣scretly in his rowme. In somoche that he called the army vnto viage / and warfare forth of theyr tentes in the moneth of Ianua∣ry: in coldest and sharpest season of wynter This dyde he: other bycause he trusted to ende the batayle in his tyme: and so therby to wynne thanke and worshyppe: or els to thentēt to gete money of Iugurh by graūtyng vnto hym peace & rest for his tyme. And
so to cōstrayne hym to bye his peace. Whan Iugurth perceyued this vnexpertnes and rasshe foly of Aulus: he sent vnto hym em∣bassadours as if he were a ferde: by dissimulacion to requyre of hym peace. And in the meane tyme the same Iugurth ledde his army among hylles & wodes fainyng as if he fledde from Aulus for drede. Aulus vnderstādyng this / persued & folowed hym mo∣re egarly & hastely / without aduisment / ordr / or {pro}uision. Whan Iugurth sawe that he had attised & drawen the Romains into a place to fyght for his auauntage: anone he assayled them & em∣batayled with them fyersly / in which batayle he ouercame the ro∣mains & putte them to flyght. On the next morne after / Iugurth and Aulus came togyder in communicacion. And at last trewes was stryken bytwene bothe parties / in this maner & by such cō∣dicions: that all the romains shuld passe vnder a spere in signe of subieccion / and that they were ouercome without more hurt. And afterwarde within ten dayes all shulde depart out of Nu∣midy / & so was it done. Whan tydyng{is} herof were brought to ro∣me: all the citie was troubled with drede & displeasure. After this shamefull trewes of Aulus and disconfiture & flyght of the ro∣mayne army / a noble man named Metellus was creat consul of Rome / & by cōmen assent sende vnto Numidi agaynst Iugurth. This Metellus behaued hymselfe as a noble captaine and va∣liaunt warriour: and perceyuynge that the residue of the army which was escaped / was disolute and out of order / by ouer moch libertie. And by faute of the captains / which were before / he first of all reduced the sowdiours to good rule and order / acordynge to the auncient ordinaunces of chyualry: and than in tyme con∣ueniēt after his army was brought to order / he assailed Iugurth fyersly. And after certayne sharpe and greuous batayles / he di∣minished his riches / his myght & power & brought hym almost to extremite. After this Metellus: one named Marius last of all was creat consul / and the prouince & warre of Numidy decreed and cōmitted to hym. This Marius anone pursued Iugurthe in batayle moost sharply & fiersly of all other / insomoche / that fi∣nally he vtterly brought hym to extremite: his frendes / his riches and power / brought all to nought. And at conclusion by treason / & betrayeng of one Bocchus / kyng of the Mauriens: Iugurthe was deliuerd to the same Marius as prisoner: whome he ledde bounde to Rome with great glory & triumphe. At last this Iu∣gurth was throwen into prison / where at conclusion he ended his miserable lyfe / in dolors & captiuite. This is the argument and processe of all this hystory and cronicle: in whiche the redar / of
whatso euer condicion and degre he be: shall fynde both profite and pleasure: if he redde it attentyfly and with good aduertens. And moost namely gentylmen apt to attayne to glorious fame & honour by fayt of chyualry: shall fynde both pleasaunt and pro∣fitable pastime / in redyng this hystory: vnto whose example / pro∣fite / and pleasure I chefely haue translated the same. ¶The prologue of this present cronycle compyled in laten by the famous romayn Salust: and trāsla∣ted into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest. MAnkynde wrongfully complayneth of his naturall dysposicion: sayeng / that his feble & frayle lyfe of short cōtinuaunce of tyme / is ra∣ther ruled by chaūces of fortune: than by {pro}ui∣sion of strength or vertu. But if man wel cōsy¦der his natural īclinacion: cōtrary to such opi∣nion: he shall fynde that nothyng longynge to mankynde / may be founde & proued greater / better / or more pre∣eminēt than his naturall inclinacion: and yt his owne diligēce & exercyse / rather fayleth hym / than outher myght or longe conti∣nuaūce of lyfe tyme. But in this opinion to iuge indifferētly: let man vnderstande that the mynde is ordayned / gyder / ruler & ca∣ptayne of mānes lyfe: which mynde: whan it valyantly intēdeth to attayne / to worshyp & dignite / by way of vertu: it is excellent ynough myghty and clere of it selfe: so that it nedeth nat to force of fortune / nor to care for her vncertayne gyftes: but to dyspise her as nat able to gyue to any man honesty / diligence or other good and vertuous exercises: nor able to depriue man agayne of the same gyftes: after he hath obtayned ye same. But on the other part if this mynde of mā / taken & blynded wt frowarde pleasurs be subdued vnto slouthe & bodyly lustes: after it hath exercised & occupied such ieo{per}dous pleasure by a lytel season: & after that by cowardous slouth / both the strength / the tyme & the wyt ar vanis¦shed away & decayed: than anone the infirmite & felylnes of na∣ture is accused & put in blame. And thus / all such slouthfull doers trāspose & lay away the faute which in themself is culpable / vnto the difficulte of such besynesses / as they haue omitted by negligē∣ce. But if it were so: that men had as great cure & affeccion of thyng{is} good and profitable / as they haue desyre & pleasure in se∣kyng & folowyng thyng{is} cōtrary vnto them & nothyng {pro}fitable
ye: & also moch {per}ylous & hurtfull: than shuld nat they be more ru¦led by ye chaūces of fortune / than they shuld rule ye sayd chaūces. And thus shulde they attayne & procede vnto so great excellence: that where they be mortall of nature they shuld be made īmortall by glory & renowmed fame. For in lykewyse as man is cōposed & made of .ii. thyng{is} (that is to say of the body & soule) right so all thyng{is} / all besynesses & exercises / to mankynd belongyng / folo∣weth / some ye nature of the body: to decay brefely & to be mortall: as it is / some other folowe ye nature of the soule / to be eternall & īmortall: as it is. Which thing forther to {pro}ue by exāple: we dayly se that ye goodly beauty of ye visage & shape of mākynde / great a∣bondaūce of riches / & also the strength of the body / with all other suche thynges & semblable / decayeth & vanyssheth away within short tyme. But cōtrarely ye excellent & worthy actes: belongyng to mānes wyt: be īmortall & euerlastyng: as the soule is īmortall. And finally in lykwyse as ye begynnyng of ye gyftes cor{per}all or na¦turall / & of the gyftes of fortune is caduke / vayne & vncertayn: ryght so is the ende of ye same mutable & trāsitory. And all thyng{is} which be borne and sprygyng: agayne decayeth & approcheth to deth: and whan these same be growen & encreased to the hegth of theyr perfeccion: agayne they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite. But the mynde and soule beynge incorrupt / eternall and gouernoure of mankynde / ruleth and weldeth all thynges: but it selfe can nat be violently ruled nor compelled by any thyng erthly / cōsyderyng the frewyll / whiche it optayneth of his creatour. For which consyderacion the frowarde iniquite of them is more to be marueyled: which subdued to the ioyes & plea¦sures of the body / passe forthe the tyme of theyr lyfe / in carnall lustes and ydelnes. But towchyng theyr wyt (whiche is the best gyft and grettest treasure graūted to mankynde) that suffre they to slomber and to slepe without exercise / in slouthe and ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoche more to be blamed: namely syth so many and diuers noble exercises & occupacions of the mynde be: by whom moost clere nobles and fame vndefyled may be op∣tayned. But of suche diuers exercises concernynge the mynde some are better refused: than procured in troublous tymes & in∣quiet. And namely in this tyme turbulent and season vnquiet: great offices / lordshyppes / rowmes to commaunde & rule: and brefely to speke. All maner cure cōcernyng the administracion of thynges apparteynyng to the commen wele: semeth vnto me nat at all to be couyted or desyred of any wyse man. For neyther is honoure gyuen vnto vertue / as condigne rewarde and worthy
therto belongyng nether suche as haue goten iurisdiction & ho∣nour / by aude & vnlaufull meanes (in lyke case) can nat be mo∣re sure nor more honest / by meane of such honour so vnright wys∣ly obtayned. For certenly a man to rule his countrey & kynred by myght & violence: all if he haue power so to do / & also though he ryght wysly correct ye crimes of trāsgressours & misdoers. Ne∣uertheles: so to do it is vnbehouefull & vnexpedient. And often at cōclusion more perilous & daūgerous: than it is sure or {pro}fita∣ble / & that namely / syth all mutacions of thynges / and chaunges of gouernours pretende and thretten slaughter / of some exile or wylfull flyght / imprisonmēt with otherlyke cruelties more lon∣gyng to ennemyes of a cōmen wele / than to defēders of the same. Than forthermore: a man to labour to ye vttermost of his power / and all in vayne. And in weryenge hymselfe to gete nought els but euylwyll and hatred: it is a point of extreme & vtter madnes / except perchaūce it be such one / whiche hath a dishonest / a foule & perilous pleasure to cast away for nought his owne worshyppe and libertie for pleasure of a fewe myghty men vsurpers of do∣minion & lordshyp. But among all other besinesse / which are ex∣ercised by mānes wyt / the redyng of hystories & the reducyng of the same to memory: is moch more necessary & {pro}fitable to all de∣grees beryng rule of a cōmen wele / but most namely vnto prīces. Of power / profet / & cōmodite wherof: I purpose at this tyme to passe ouer wt silence / bycause many other authours haue wryten of the same before my tyme. And also that no man shulde suppose my selfe by pride or insolēce: to bost myne owne study vainly lau∣dyng ye same. But moch cōtrary I beleue rather yt some enuious maligners shalbe herafter which shall obiect & ascribe a name of slouth and negligēce to this my labour. How great & profitable so euer it be: & that bycause I haue determined to lede my lyfe so∣litarely: ferre from medlyng with the cōmen wele. Certainly (as I suppose) they onely shall impute and ascribe suche name to me and to this my laboure: whiche thynketh it a moost great & sin∣gular craft or practised wysdome to wynne beniuolence / by sa∣lutyng the cōmen people / and by dyssimulate reuerence done to euery man passyng by them / or els to gete fauour by festyng and flateryng the commenty. Whiche enuious maligners: yf they wolde cōsider bothe in what maner seasons and in what ieopar∣dous tymes I haue obtayned offices and rowmes of auctorite & what men wold gladly / and yet myght nat obtayne suche row∣mes Moreouer yf they call to mynde what maner of men after∣warde came into the order of senatours For certayne if my wyl∣lers
consider inedifferētly these premisses: than shall they thinke that I haue chaunged the purpose of my mynde: more for cause reasonable: and by good aduisemēt / than for slouth & cowardise / and they shall fynde / that more profet shall come to the commen wale by this my study (which they count but ydelnes and tyme misspent) than of the labour and besynes whiche other men take vpon them fayntly and iniustly administryng the commen wele. And they shall fynde that my writing shal proue itselfe more lau∣dable and profitable to the cōmente / than theyr vndiscrete gouer¦naunce. For often haue I herde of the famous princes Quintus Maximus / & Publius Scipio / and besyde these of many other ryght famous and worthy men of the citie of Rome / which whan they behelde the ymages of theyr forefathers made of stone / of waxe / or of metall / and erect into hye trones in memoriall of the valiaunt and magnificent actes by them done for the commen wele: the sayd princes in aduisynge such ymages were wont to say vnto suche as stode nere by them: that theyr myndes were gretly kyndeled to vertue and nobles in cōtemplyng of the same. The case is playne: yt suche figures of metall / stone / or waxe had nat such operacion nor myght within themselfe. But such hygh courage & flame was kyndeled and increased in the hardy her∣tes of such noble men and valiant warrious / by remembraūce of the glorious dedes of theyr forfathers in theyr lyfe tyme / done & represēted to their memory by such ymages / insomoche that this flame kyndled in theyr hertes to vertu coude neuer be slaked nor saciate in them / tyll tyme that they were equall with their forefa∣thers in vertu / fame / and glory. Than how moch more ought the clere descripcion of hystores to kyndell vnto boldnes and vertu / the myndes of noble men by redyng of the same. But moche con∣trary / if we aduert the worlde as it is now among all men which lyue / and conforme themselfe to the maners vsed nowe adayes / where shall we fynde one: but that wyll striue and contende with theyr forefathers to ouercome them / other in couetise & superflu∣ous riches / or els in prodigalite & wastfull expences / and nat in honest and laudable lyfe / good excercices and diligence? And moreouer gentylmen of ye first heed / which were wont to preuent auncient noblemen & ascende vnto vertu & nobles / by vertuous maners: such laboure now to lordshyp / honour and authorite / by fraude & falshode: rather than by very vertu or good meanes & laudable. After suche maner as if the office of a hye Iuge / of a Tresourer / a Cōsull / a Prouost / and all such other great offices / were noble and excellēt of themselfe. And nat in maner as if suche
offices shulde be counted of worthynes and dignite: after as the vertue and honour is / of suche as rule in the same offices and hy rowmes. But playnly affirmyng the treuth: the man maketh the office noble & worshypfull: yf his maners shyne by vertue. But yf his conuersacion be contrary / no office / no rowme / can make hym noble nor worshypfull. But this omittynge I haue proce∣ded in this prologue with ouer ferre circūstaunce / and also with somwhat to moche libertie of wordes / more than in a preface is requisite: for that it pyteeth me of these tedious maners of this oure cite of Rome. But nowe wyll I come to my mater pur∣posed / and first interpryse begon. ¶Of what mater Salust intendeth to treat in pro∣ces of this boke / and what causes moueth hym of suche mater to write. ¶The fyrst chapter. IN this warke I purpose to wryte of the warre / whiche the Romayns had and execu∣ted agaynst the tyranne Iugurth / wrongful∣ly vsurpynge the name of a kynge / ouer the lande of Numidy. Many causes moueth me by writynge to commende this warre to per∣petual memory. First for that in the same was foughten at many tymes with great multitude of men on eyther partie / with moche cruell murdre and variable victory: the Ro∣mains somtyme / somtyme the Iugurthins preuaylyng in victo∣ry. Forthermore bycause that first at this batayle: & from thens forwarde the commen people of Rome matched with the prin∣ces / resistynge theyr pride. For where as before this tyme the no∣ble men of Rome oppressed and subdued the commens with vn∣reasonable rigoure / the commens elect one named Marius a man of basse byrth to be cōsull of Rome / and captaine in this ba∣tayle: whiche after he had obtayned victory ouer Iugurth with great glory / triumphe / & fauour of the commontie / he supported them in such wyse agaynst the noble men: that of the same rose a ciuile bataile & greuous discorde / bytwene the noble men and cō∣mens of Rome: Marius maintenyng the cōmens partie / & Sil∣la susteyning ye partie of the noble men. Insomoch yt finally by∣twene these two {per}ties & captayns of ye same was foughten an vn∣kynde / vnnaturall / & cruel batel: to ye greuous ruine of ye Romay¦ne empire / & subuercion of the cōmen wele. Which cōtencion and
variaunce confounded bothe the lawes of god and man / and by the same were all good ordinaūces disordred. And this same fu∣rious debate & foly proceded at last to so vnresonable madnesse and excecate fury / that it neuer desisted / nor this variaunce and discencion bytwene the noble men and commens neuer ceased: tyll tyme that cruell and mortal batayle foughten bytwene both parties / and tyll tyme that also distruction of the lande of Italy cōpelled both parties at last to consyder theyr owne blynde foly & cruell furor: & so finally to mittigate & fynisshe their debate & vn∣resonable dyssencion. But fyrst or I begyn to write of this batell I shall repeat and declare a fewe thing{is} done before this warre began: to thentent that all thing{is} moost chefe / worthy & expediēt to be knowen / may be more euidēt / open / & clere / to the reders. ¶How the kyng Massinissa came into the fauour of the Romayns / and how the lande of Numydy was committed vnto hym. The seconde chapter. THe Romayns had thre notable and famous ba∣tayls agaynst the Carthaginēces / in which the same Romayns had great dammage. Howbeit in conclu∣sion of euery batayle they wanne victory of theyr en¦nemyes: in the seconde of these batayles what tyme Hanyball duke and captayne of the Carthaginēces wasted the welth and riches of Italy more than any other ennemy had euer done before / after the Romayns began̄e to haue any great name and to delate theyr dominion: A famous prince named Massi∣nissa kynge of the lande of Numydy was receyued into frend∣shyppe & fauour of the Romayns: by one Publius Scipio ca∣ptayne of the sayd Romayns / which Scipio afterwarde for his manhode was named Scipio Affrycan / bycause he ouercame & subdued the lande of Affrike. This Massinissa so receyued into fauour of the Romayns in the foresayd batayle dyd many noble and famous actes of chyualry / with hygh valiantise & corage. For which dedes: after the Romayns had ouercome ye Cartha∣ginencis & theyr cite: and after they had taken prisoner the kyng Sciphar / which had in Affrike a worthy / great / & large impire the people of Rome gaue frely vnto the same kynge Massinissa / all suche cities & landes as they had taken and wone in batayle. For which benefites so magnificēt & ample Massinissa cōtinued vnto them in profitable & faythfull frendshyp his lyfe induryng:
but at last his lyfe ended / and the welth of his empire decayed al¦so with hym. This kynge departyng left behynde hym thre son∣nes: whose names were Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa: of whome Micipsa succeded his father / and alone obtayned the kyngdome: after that this other two brethern Manastabal and Galussa / were departed frome this lyfe by sickenesse. This Mi∣cipsa had two sonnes named Adherball & Hiempsall. But Ma∣nastabal his brother whiche departed (as sayd is) left behynde hym one sonne nat laufully borne / but a bastarde / begoten of his cōcubine: wherfore departyng he left hym orbate without lande or lyuelode. This cōsydering Micipsa suffred hym nat to faute nor decay: but forasmoche as he was his brothers son̄e / receyued hym into his court / & hym cherysshed in lykewyse as he dyd his owne sonnes / Adherball and Hiempsall. This Iugurth after that he was a lytell growen vp to age: was myghty in strength comely / and fayre of face: but moost of all / excellent of wyt & wys∣dome. Nor he gaue nat hymselfe to be corrupt with lust nor in∣crafty slouthe: but as is the custome & maner of the people of Nu¦midy hymselfe he exercised / somtyme in rydyng / somtyme in ca∣styng the dart & iustyng / and somtyme in ronnyng & wrestlyng / with his companyons of lyke age. And nat withstandynge / that in laude and prayse he passed all his perys: yet none enuied hym but he was derely beloued / cherysshed / and lauded of all men. Moreouer he passed moche of his tyme in huntyng of wylde be∣stes whiche in that lande habounded: he was the first / or one among the first which durst assaile and stryke the lyon / and other cruell and wylde bestes: he dyde moche: and lytell sayd or bosted of hymselfe. For suche demeanour his vncle Micipsa at first be∣gynnynge was gladde and ioyefull: supposynge that in tyme to come the manly behauour and strength of Iugurth shuld be glo¦ry and honour to all his kyngdome. But afterwarde in processe of tyme whan he cōsydred and vnderstode his lyfe approchynge fast to ende his naturall sonnes yong / & vnexpert. And this yong man Iugurth in honour and fauour dayly encreasyng more and more he reuolued many thynges in mynde greatly moued with suche solicitude and besynesse. Forthermore he consydred / that all men of kynde be naturally inclined to desyre / to rule / and commaunde by lordeshyppe: rather than to be ruled and subiect. And howe man is prone and hedlynge inclined to fulfyll the de∣syers of his mynde dredynge no daungers: nor suspectynge no peryll / whyle he is ececate by ambicion and desyre of lordshyp. Moreouer aduisyng the oportunite of his owne age / and of the
age of his chyldren which for yongh were nat able to resyst any power or violence: whiche oportunite is wont to be nat small confort / audacite and courage / nat onely to bolde herres / but also to meane men and cowardes intendyng to conspyre aga∣ynst theyr princes in hope of pray and promocions. Such con∣syderacyons feared sore the mynde of Micipsa / besyde these his drede and dolour was more augmented: whan he behelde the fauour & hertes of all his subgettes of the lande of Numi∣dy vtterly inclyned to Iugurth: wherfore to put to deth the same Iugurth by any gyle (as his purpose was to do) he drad moost of all: dowtyng lyst therof myght succede bytwene hym and his subgettes some insurrexion or batayle. Micipsa com∣pased on euery syde with these difficulties / was sore troubled in mynde. And whan he sawe that nother by strength nor gyle he myght distroy a man so well beloued of the commens / (as was Iugurth) at last he deuised an other way to ryd hym: and that without daūger or suspeccion / wherfore Micipsa ad∣uertyng that Iugurth was redy of hande to stryke / auēerous and moche desyrous of honour and laude of chyualry / he con∣cluded with hymselfe to obiect hym to daunger and peryll of warre: and by that meane to assay the fortune of batayle. ¶Nowe at the same season the Romains warred agaynst a cite of Hispayne named Numance: vnto whiche warre diuers kynges to the commens associate sent vnto them socours aga∣ynst the same cite. Amonge whome Micipsa also sent a fayre company of horsmen and fotemen: ouer whome he made Iu∣gurth captaine: and sent hym forth with them into Hispayne / trustyng that ther he lightly shuld be ouerthrowen and slayne in batayle: other in shewynge his manhod and strength / or els by fyersnes and crueltie of his ennemyes. But this thyng for / tuned moche contrary to his opinion. For Iugurth was of mynde and courage valiaunt and bolde / and of wytte quicke and redy / so that after he had parceyued the disposicion / beha∣uour and maners of Publius Scipio: at that tyme captayne of the romains / and whan he had consydred also the maners of his ennemyes / he behaued hymselfe in suche wyse with moch labour / besynes and cure / in obeyng his captaine with so good maner & often tymes countryng his ennemyes without drede of perill. Insomoch that within short tyme he came to so great fame and worshyppe / that vnto the romains he was maruey∣lous dere and well beloued / and of the Numantines drade as deth: and certaynly / among the chefyst he was worthy and va∣liaunt in batayle: and also good of counsell / of wysdome pre∣gnaunt and circumspect. Which two thynges be moche harde to be in one man both togyder: for wysdom is often wont to
make men a ferde and to drede many peryls bycause of proui∣dence. But boldnes and audacite causeth men to be rasshe and folehardy / bycause of haut courage. But his wysdome directed his strength / and his strength was obedient to wysdome. Wherfore Scipio the captaine dyd almost euery ieopardous and wyghty thyng by hand & counsell of Iugurth: hym coun∣tyng among his chefe frendes and dayly cherysshed hym more & more and no marueyle / for there was no coūsell / nor interpri∣se begon of Iugurth frustrate or in vayne / but al came to good effect. Besyde these gyftes aboue sayd he was curtes of mynde lyberall / and of wyt ryght discrete & prudent: by which gyftes he adioyned vnto hym many of ye romains in familier frende¦shyp. At that same season in the army of Rome were ryght ma∣ny newe: and also auncient gentylmen / whiche set more by ri∣ches than goodnes or honeste. At home in Rome were they sowers of dyscorde and debatfull / great in fame amonge the frendes of the romains. But more famous by worshyppe and rowme / than by honest conuersacion. These kyndled the mynd of Iugurth nat a lytell promisyng often tymes and sayeng to set his courage on fyre: that if the kyng Micipsa discessed the tyme shulde come that Iugurth alone shulde enioye the hole kyngdome of Numidy without any partyner. For in hym (they sayd) was great vertue / great manhode / strength & au∣dacite with wysdome / able to gouerne suche a kyngdome: and nothynge was so iniust and false but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for gold / and all thynges were there to be solde by co∣uetyse of noble men. ¶Howe Publius Scipio counselled Iugurth at his departynge after the cyte of Numance was dystroyed. ¶The thyrde chapter. THus contynued Iugurth in the romains ar∣my in Hispayne with great fauour of ye romains and namely of Scipio the captaine: tyll at last the army of Rome had distroyed the sayd cite of Nu∣mance. Than Publius Scipio concluded to re∣tourne agayne to Rome: and to congye and licence suche so∣cours as were sent vnto hym from other kynges: amonge all other he called Iugurth vnto hym: and before the multitude of all the army assembled / lauded and commended hym magni∣ficently recitynge his glorious actes and manly dedes of chy∣ualry. And after that worthely and rychely rewarded hym for his labours. This done: he conueyed hym into the captains
tent: and there secretly warned hym that he shulde cōtinue and worshyppe the frendshyppe of the people of Rome rather hole togyder and commenly / than priuately leanyng to any singu∣ler rulers. Moreouer addynge these monicions: that he shulde nat rather rewarde and be liberall to a fewe priuatly: than to a hole cōmente / sayeng that it was a perillous thyng to bye that: of a fewe persons: whiche belonge vnto many in commen. If he wolde perseuer and contynue in so noble condicions as he had begon: he shulde shortely come to great honour / glory and dignite royall / more than he wolde desyre. But if he wold procede and labour to ascende ouer hastely / than shuld both he and his riches fall heedlynge to ruyne and decay. After Sci∣pio had sayd these wordes with such lyke: he licensed Iugurth to depart / and sent hym vnto his vncle Micipsa agayne into the lande of Numidy with letters direct vnto the same kyng Micipsa: of whiche letters the tenure and sentence hereafter ensueth: and was suche. ¶The sentence of the letter dyrect from Publius Scipio captaine of the romaine army in Hispay∣ne vnto Micipsa kynge of Numidy. ¶The fourthe chapter. PVblius Scipio captaine of the romain army in Hispayne sendeth helth and saluta∣cion to Micipsa kynge of Numidy frende and felowe of the empire of Rome. The vertue / strength and noblenes of your ne∣uewe Iugurth whome ye sent vnto our so∣cours hath ben proued in this warre of Nu¦mance / ferre excellent aboue any other warriour of our rety∣nue / which thyng I knowe for certayne is to your great plea∣sure & gladnes. For his worthy merytes he is right dere and well beloued vnto vs. And we shall deuoyr vs to the best of our power that he may be lyke dere and well beloued of all the se∣natours and people of Rome. I am surely ryght ioyefull on your behalfe of this your treasoure Iugurth: thaūcient amyte bytwene you & me: byndeth me to be gladde of this your com∣modite. For certaynely lo here haue ye a man of Iugurth wor∣thy to discende of such noble stocke as ye ar and as his grand∣father Massinissa was in his dayes: whome he foloweth in all pointes of vertue and magnanimite. ¶Howe the kyng Micipsa adopted Iugurth vn∣to his sonne. ¶The fyfte chapter.
WIth these letters of Scipio Iugurth retour¦ned into Numydy vnto his vncle Micipsa: where he was worthely & ioyefully receyued of the cōmentie. But after that the kyng Micipsa vnderstode by these letters of commendacion of the captaine Scipio: that the valiaūt and noble actes of Iu∣gurth were trewe: which longe before he had harde by report of the commen fame: than what for the nobles of Iugurthe & fauour bothe of his dedes and commendacion of Scipio he moued his mynde chaunged from his foresayd purpose / and nat forther intended to oppresse Iugurth by malice nor enuy. But concluded to attempt to ouercome hym with benefites & kyndnesse: to thentent that he so ouercome / shuld nat in tyme to come fynde in his hert for pyte to indommage hym nor his heyres. And soone after this purpose the same Micipsa ado∣pted Iugurth vnto his sonne: and farthermore decreed and ordayned in his testament that Iugurth shulde be one of his heyres: and partener in possession of his kyngdome togyder with his two naturall sonnes / Adherball and Hiempsall. But a fewe yeres after this ordinaūce Micipsa what by age / what by sykenesse / drewe nere vnto his ende of lyfe / and was consumed by age & dysease: wherfore consideryng his deth so fast approchyng it is sayd that he called Iugurth before hym and than before many of his frendes and kynsmen: also in pre¦sence of his two naturall sonnes Adherball and Hiempsall / he had to the same Iugurth suche wordes as herafter insue and folowe. ¶The exhortacion which the kynge Micipsa a lytell before his deth had to Iugurth. ¶The sixt chapter. MIdere sonne Iugurthe / I knowe it is nat out of your remembraunce: howe after that ye had lost your father my brother I charitably & louyngly receyued you yonge & of tender age into my kyngdome: what tyme ye were without riches / without con∣fort: and without any hope of confort or ryches / but very lykely to haue ben caste away. This dyde I / thynkyng that for these my benefites and kyndnesse I shulde be vnto you nat lesse intyerly beloued than of myne owne na∣turall chyldren with my body begotten. Nor certainly this my hath nat dysceyued me. For why to ouerpasse your other
great / magnificent and excellent dedes of you valyauntly done before: specially now last of all cōmyng from the warre of Numance ye greatly adourned & inhaunced to honoure and glory / bothe of myne owne persone & this my kyngdome. And where as the romains in fore tymes were frendes vnto vs: by your vertue and manly actes ye haue establysshed that amytie: and of frendes made them moche more frendes. So that in Hispayne the name & glory of our housholde by your manhode is renouate and renewed. Thus finally: ye haue ouercome the enuy of your ylwyllers onely by your glorious actes and valiaūt interprises: whiche is one of the moost har¦dyest thynges to be done amonge mankynde and of moost difficultie. Wherfore nowe my sonne Iugurth: sythe it is so: that nature hath nere concluded the ende of my lyfe: I admo¦nest charge and exhorte you by the fayth of your right hand: and by the fayth and fidelite whiche ye owe to this my kyng∣dome I obtest and requyre you / that ye loue / mentayne and cherysshe these my two sonnes Adherball & Hiempsall: which of kynred be nere to you / and by my benefite and kyndnes are bretherne vnto you. Forthermore I exhorte you that ye coūtenat leferre and more pleasure to acquaynt and cōioyne vnto you forayns or straungers / rather than to retayne suche as be ioyned to you by naturall blode & kynred. For neyther is a great army of men nor habundance of treasours: ye chfe socours or defence of a kyngdome: but moche rather trusty and faythfull frendes: whome a man can neyther compelle by force of armes: nor yet bye with golde nor syluer to par∣seuer in stedfast amyte: but they be otayned & kept by kynd∣nesse / good dedes / fidelite and faythfulnesse. But among all frendes: who can be more frendly and stedfast in amyte than brother to brother. Certaynly none ought to be more louyng of naturall inclinacion. Or what straūger shal ye fynd fayth∣full and trusty to you: if ye shewe yourselfe ennemy to your owne kynsmen? For sothe if ye cōtynue togyder honest / good and louynge in agreable concorde bytwene yourselfe: thanne this kyngdome which I committe and gue vnto you shall continue sure and stedfast: as it is nowe. But cōtrarely if ye be yll and disagreynge among yourselfe / ye shall in short sea∣son make it ryght poore / feble and incertayne. For by loue / peace and concorde: small ryches / small lordshyppes / and ge∣nerally all small thynges increase and multiplie: by discorde the grettest thynges of the worlde decay and fall vtterly to ruyne. But you my sonne Iugurthe bycause ye passe these myne other two naturall son̄es in age and wysdome / therfore it semeth you so moche more than them: to make suche wyse
prouision bothe for yourselfe and for them also that nothyng happen otherwyse than well. For in euery stryffe and debate: howe be it he whiche is myghtyer and rycher often suffreth iniury. Neuerthelesse it semeth more that he dothe wronge thanne suffreth: bycause that he is more of power and myght thanne his feble aduersary. But ye my dere sonnes Adher∣ball and Hiempsall se that ye worshyppe and loue this Iu∣gurth your worthy vncle. And bewarre that ye nat offende nor dysplease hym: but folow his vertue & manly behauour. And do your deuoir to the best of your power after his exam∣ple behauynge yourselfe / so discretely and so wysely that it be nat hereafter reported by me / that I haue takenne vnto me by adoption / better chyldren thanne I haue begotten. Thus concluded the kyng Micipsa his wordes. How beit Iugurth well perceyued the kynges wordes: but fayned and spoken agaynst his hert: if any other remedy myght haue ben foūde: neuertheles he answered benygnely for the tyme / all if he thought and reuoulued in his mynde moche otherwyse / and contrary to his humble and mylde answere. ¶Howe the kynge Micipsa departed from lyfe / and of the first cause of dissencion and discorde betwene Iugurth / Adherball & Hiempsall. ¶The .vii. chapter. NAt longe after the kynge Micipsa decessed whose dethe was dolourous and sore bewayled of all his subgett{is}: but most of all to his naturall sonnes it was to be la¦mēted: and nat without great cause as the processe of this hystorie shall afterwarde declare. But after the kyng{is} funerall exe∣quies were magnificently ended as apertayned to his state royall. The thre princes that is to say Adherball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth anone assembled to the intent to commen and treat of busynesses of the royalme / cōcernynge particion and separation of the same: and all other thynges conuenient. But whan they shulde sytte and take their places in order: Hiempsall yongest of the thre was somwat fyers of nature / and disposed to statelynesse. And in mynde longe before this tyme he disdayned the ignobilite of Iugurth / for asmoche as he was vnlyke vnto them of byrth towchynge his mothers syde / and a bastarde borne: as is sayd before. Wherfore he dysdayned that the same Iugurthe shulde haue the place of moost honoure among them / whiche were naturall sonnes of
a kynge / and also laufully borne: and so in contempt of Iu∣gurth he set hym selfe downe on the ryght hande of his bro∣ther Adherball: to thyntent that Iugurthe shulde nat syt in the myddes bytwene them: whiche rowme the Numydyens count of most honour. And afterwarde howbeit his bro∣ther Adherbal requyred hym often to gyue place to Iugurth bycause of his age: yet vnnethes coude be with moche payne induce hym therto: but at laste fatygate by requestes of his brother and of other noble men of the realme: he chaunged his place and set hym vpon the other syde with countenaūce declaryng his mynde nat cōtented. And thus at laste satte Iu¦gurth for his age in the myddes bytwene them bothe / as in place of moost honour. Whanne the thre princes were thus sette and had communed of many thynges concernynge the adminystracion of the kyngdome: amonge many and dy∣uers other thynges Iugurth sayd / that all the statutes and ordynaunces whiche the kynge Micipsa hadde made fyue yeres before his deth / ought of congruence to be adnulled as of none effecte. For in that season (as sayde he) his wyt what for age / what for syckenesse was feble / dull and of small valoure. And therfore suche thynges as he had in that space enacted were done without wysdome or reason. Whanne Hiempsall herde Iugurth thus speke: he answered / sayenge that it pleased hym ryght well that it shulde so be done. For within the same thre yeres (sayd he) our father Micipsa hath adopted you to his sonne / and in his testamēt ordayned you to be partiner of his kyngdome: whiche was the worst and most vnaduised dede that euer he dyd yonge or olde. Wherfore Iugurth accordynge to your owne ordy∣naunce this must fyrst of all be adnulled and broken / whiche done / my brother and I shall nat greatly contende for the re∣menant. These wordes of Hiempsall pearsed the hert of Iugurth more profoūdely thanne any man there thought or suspected. Wherfore from that tyme forwarde: what for wra∣the of these wordes / and for drede of losse of his porcyon of the kyngdome / his mynde was in great trouble and anguysshe. In somoche that from thens forthe: he went aboute / ymagy∣ned / ordayned / and onely reuoulued in his mynde: by what gyle or treason Hiempsall myght be caught in his daunger. But whanne his purpose proceded but slowly forwarde / con¦sydrynge that the frowarde desyre and vnrefrenable appetie of his mynde coude nat be mytigated nor pacyfied: he con∣cluded to bryng his enterprise to effect by any maner meanes outher by preuy treason and gyle: or els by euydent and open violēce & force of armes. But to retourne agayn where I left.
In this first assemble of the thre princes of whiche I spake before: it pleased them all that the treasours of kyng Micipsa shulde be deuyded among them bycause of this dyssencion. And also that the marches and boūdes of eche of theyr domi∣nions / seuerally shulde be assigned to eche of them his por∣cion. Wherfore the tyme was apoynted and prefixed whanne bothe shulde be done: but the tyme to departe the treasoures was sonner assigned than to deuyde and limitte the boundes of theyr dominions. This apoyntemēt made: the princes de∣parted company: the mynde of Iugurth nat a lytell inquye∣ted for the sayde checke of Hiempsall: for whiche cause he awayted his tyme to reuenge hym. ¶How Iugurth by treason murdred Hiempsall the yonger sonne of kynge Micipsa. ¶The eyght chapter. WHan the thre prynces were depar∣ted in sonder: as I haue sayde before: they soiourned in sondry places / and that nere to the towre where the treasours lay. Hiem¦psall drewe hym to a towne named Thir∣myda nat ferre distant. In whiche towne he had a dwellynge place: than as happe¦ned in the same towne was a man of the garde longynge to Iugurth of his lorde ryght derely beloued / and with hym greatly in fauoure. This seruaunt of Iugurth was moche conuersaunt and familyer in the house of Hiempsall / whan Iugurth by chaunce remembred this oportunite to his mys∣cheuous purpose: he called secretly vnto hym his sayde ser∣uaūt. And after many wordes spoken to serche his mynde: at last by promesse of large rewardes he induced hym to cōsent to go as if t were to visyte the house of Hiempsall: as he had often done before tyme: and by some meanes & craft to coun∣terfayte the kayes of the gates and brynge them vnto hym. For the ryght kayes: after the gates were locked: nyghly we∣re delyuerd vnto Hiempsall hymselfe: so myght they nat be vnmyssed the space of a nyght. Whan Iugurth had induced the Numidian to cōsent to this dede: he {pro}mysed hymselfe wt∣in shorte tyme after to come to the sayd lodgyng of Hiempsal what tyme ye case shulde requyre: with great power of armed men. The Numydyan in shorte tyme perfourmed the com∣maundement of Iugurth / insomoche that he brought vnto hym the counterfayted kayes: as he had apoynted. Iugurth
hereof was gladde in mynde: and anone prepared secretly a great company of armed men: whome he commaunded to bringe vnto hym the heed of Hiempsall trenched from the bo∣dy: and in executynge of this dede he commaunded them all to be ruled by the Numydyan whiche had counterfayted the keys. This done the sayd Numydyan conuayed these armed men preuyly by nyght into the house of Hiempsall / lyke as he was infourmed by Iugurth. Whan this treatoure satellyte was entred with his company & had broken into the inwarde edifices: diuers of them serched for the prince Hiempsall: som murdred his seruauntes as they lay slepynge in theyr beddys suspectynge no suche treason: some other a wakened with the dynne stert vp and mette theyr ennemyes defendynge them∣selfe but all in vayne: for they had no leyser to arme themselfe. And therfore were they slayne anone vnarmed of men armed & apointed to myschefe: whan the treatours had longe sought Hiempsall and myght nat fynde hym: than serched they mo∣re nerely euery hyd corner / and secret close places they brast open: all was full of dynne mengled with noyse and clamour: So moche they sought and so nerely: that at last they foūde out Hiempsall / hyd in the cotage of a poore seruyng woman to whiche place he had fled at begynnyg of this affray: as a man astonyed for drede and ignorant of the place. Anone as the Numidyans had foūde hym they slewe hym without any mercy. And as they were commaunded cutte of his heed and brought the same to Iugurth: but shortly after: the fame of this cruell and tyrannous dede was diuulgate & ouer spred all the landes of Affrike: Adherball and all they whiche were vnder subieccion of Micepsa whyle he lyued: were sore trou∣bled & abasshed with fere for this tyrannous crueltie of Iu∣gurth. The Numidyans anone deuyded themselfe into two partes. The moost part drewe and leaned to Adherball / but suche as were moost manly and best to batayle drewe them to the other partie: and leaned to Iugurth. Wherfore he made redy as great an army as he myght ioynynge vnto hym and bryngyng vnder his subieccion the townes & cities of Numi∣dy: some by violence / and some other by theyr owne volūtary wyll. In somoch that finally he kept vnder his subieccion and bondage the hole lande of Numidy. But nat withstandynge that Adherbal had sent embassadours to Rome: to certify the senatours of ye deth of his brother how cowardly he was mur¦dred / & also to informe them of his owne miserable fortune & in what case he was: neuerthelesse he made hymselfe redy to fyght wt Iugurth as he which had trust & confidence in mul∣titude of his sowdyours assembled redy to batayle.
¶Howe Iugurth ouercame Adherball in batayll and putte hym to flyght: howe Adherball fledde to Rome to cōplayne to the senatours: and howe Iugurthe accloyed with rewardes many of the rulers of Rome: by whose fauour his cruelte was defended. ¶The .ix. chapter. NOw had Iugurth assembled his hoost redy vnto batayle: nat lyke in multitude to the company of Adherbal: but as I sayd before moche bolder better expert & exer∣cised in warre. On the other partie Adher∣ball had his people redy apointed / and both the armyes approched togyder. But whan they ioyned batayle / and whan it came to byckerynge: that the matter must be tryed with strokes. Anone Adherball was vanquesshed: and to saue his lyfe fledde from the batayle into a prouince marchynge on the lande of Numidy: and frome thens with all hast spedde hym vnto Rome to complayne his miserable fortune / and to requyre socours / as I shall after∣warde declare. But than Iugurth whan he had all the lande of Numydy at his pleasure / counselled with his frendes of many thynges. At conclusion: whan he consydred by hymselfe that he had slayne Hiempsall and chased Adherball out of his kyngdome: whan he was ydle and at rest: he often secretly re∣uoulued in mynde his owne crueltie: sore dredynge what pu∣nysshement the Romains wolde ordayne agaynst the same. Nor agaynst the ire and displeasure of the Romains had he none other hope nor confort / saue in the couetyse of the noble men of Rome / and in thabundaunce of his treasours: wher∣with he trusted to corrupte the rulers of Rome to be fauo∣rable to hym. This consydred within fewe dayes after he sent to Rome embassadours with moche golde and siluer to whome he gaue in commaundement: that first of all they shulde satisfy his olde frendes with rewardes and money / and than to spare no gyftes to get vnto hym mo new frendes. And brefely that they shulde nat spare nor tary to procure vnto hym fauourers and mainterners of his part: and all thynges for his auauntage by gyftes and promysses. But after these embassadours were come to Rome: accordyng to the cōmaun∣dement of theyr kyng: they gaue and sent to his acquayntaun∣ce and frendes / and to suche as amonge the senatours: at that tyme had moost authorite: large and great rewardes.
Insomoche that anone among them was so great a chaunge: that the maruelous enuy / hatred and euyl wyll: which they had agaynst Iugurthe was all chaunged into fauour and grace amonge the noble men. Of whome some were so induced by gyftes receyued: and some other by hope of brybes in tyme to come: that they went about among the senatours from one to one / labourynge & intretyng that at that season nothyng shuld be extremely nor greuously determined agaynst Iugurth. Thus after the embassadours of Iugurth had cōfidence and trust ynough in theyr cause they laboured to haue a day apoin∣ted to apere in court. The day of apparence was graunted as well to them as to Adherball: to Adherball as playntife: and to the embassadours as defendentes for Iugurth: whan the day assigned was come bothe the parties appered in court be∣fore the senatours / than after audience graunted / Adherball began to speke vnder forme folowynge / for complaint and de∣claracion of his iniuries and oppression. ¶Here insueth the oracyon of Adherball: deuised in forme deliberatiue: in whiche he exhorteth the senatours to cōmaunde socours & ayde to be assi∣gned vnto hym / prouynge the same to be profita∣ble / honest and easy to the Romains to do: profita: ble: that he myght cōtynue a frende vnto the em∣pire of Rome: honest: for his father & grandfather had so deserued: easy to be done: for the Romains at that tyme had none other warre els where. ¶The .x. chapter. MOost dyscrete chosen fathers and noble senatours: Micipsa my father at houre of his deth cōmaūded me that I shulde thynke nought els of the lande of Numidy to aper∣tayne to me: saue onely the rule and admi∣nistracion of the same: affirmynge that the title of possession and empyre of the same belonged to you & to the people of Rome. Moreouer he gaue me in commaundement to do my deuoyr: to be vnto you ser∣uiable aboue all thynges: both in place and in warre. And that I shulde count you vnto me in place of kynsmen: and nerest frendes of alyaunce. Sayenge that if I so dyd: than by your amite and frendshyppe I shulde fynde socours / ryches / and defence of the kyngdome of Numydy / and of me and myne
in all tymes of nede: which precept{is} of my father: whyle I kest in mynde to obserue: sodaynly Iugurth the moost cruell & cur∣sed of all men whome the grounde susteyneth / dyspisyng your empyre: hath dryuen me from your kyngdome & from all my other goodes of fortune: nothyng regardynge that I am ne∣uew of Massinissa / and by myne auncetry a felowe and frende of the empyre and people of Rome. But certaynly worthy and chosen fathers: syth I am come to that misery that necessite cō∣strayneth me to desyre your ayde and socours: I wolde moch rather that I myght call for your helpe: for myne owne mery∣tes agaynst you done: than for the merites of my forefathers: and that by suche meanes of myne owne deseruynge / your be∣nefites and socours were due vnto me / which wolde god that I neded nat at all: but if this your socours myght so of you be desyred by my merites & deseruyng: than shulde I call boldly to you: and vse your socours of duety as myne auncetry haue done in tymes passed. But nowe syth it is so / that honest lyfe and innocence: in this worlde fyndeth lytell surenesse by themselfe without proteccion of some other. Moreouer syth it was nat in my power to mitigate nor to withstande this ty∣rannous iniury of Iugurth. Therfore chosen fathers I am nowe fled vnto you as to my chefe refuge / coarted to necessitie to requyre your socours and cōstrayned to put you to besynes & charge: before I haue done any pleasure or profet vnto you: whiche thyng greued me moost of all / and is one of my gretest miseries. Ryght worthy senatours other kynges haue ben re∣ceyued into yor frendshyppe & fauour / after ye haue ouercome them in batayle / or els perceyuynge themselfe in danger and in doubtfull chaūches of fortune: they haue coueyted and desyred your felowshyppe and fauour / rather for theyr owne wele than for yours. But moche contrarely: our forefathers and rote of our lynage Massinissa confederated hymselfe with the people of Rome in the seconde batayle of Carthage: what tyme was more faythfulnes to be trusted in them & theyr good wyll / than of welth or riches to be optayned of the romains / beynge at that tyme assayled with warre on euery syde: theyr riches and treasours consumed by often batayles. Thus it is euident that our auncetry confederat nat themselfe to your felowshyp for theyr owne defence: in hope of riches: in hope of dominion: nor for any other priuate profet / but onely for fauour & loue whiche they had vnto your empyre. Wherfore noble senatours suffre nat the progeny and braunches of this stocke to be distroyed. Suffre nat me whiche am neuewe of your trusty frende Mas∣sinissa to aske of you helpe and socours in vayne. But prudēt fathers: if it were so that I had none other cause to demaunde
socours of you / saue onely this miserable fortune wherwith I am oppressed: that I whiche was lately a kyng by lineall dyscent: myghty of auncetry: excellent and clere of fame: ha∣bundaūt in riches and of men of armes / and now dysformed by myserable calamite / poore and nedy / so that I am con∣strayned to seke helpe & socours of other men: if I had none other mater wherof to complayne / saue this miserable fortu∣ne onely. Neuerthelesse it longeth & is conuenient to the ma∣gesty of the people of Rome / to prohibite & to withstande in∣iury. And nat to suffre ye kyngdome or dominion of any man to ryse and increase by falshode & myscheuous tyranny. And the ryght heyres agaynst ryght / agaynst iustice / and agaynst reason / to be excluded from theyr true heritage. But verely I am excluded and cast forthe of that countrey / which the ro∣mayns in tyme passed gaue vnto my forefathers: out of the which countrey my father & grandfather accompanyed with your army and helpe: haue chased ye kynge Siphax / and also the Carthaginences / bothe moost violent enmyes to the em∣pyre of Rome. Your benefites be spoyled fro me: In this myn iniury be ye dispysed. Wo is me miserable exulate: Alas my dere father Micipsa / ar your gode dedes & kyndnes anenst Iugurth come to this poynt and cōclusion: that he before all other shuld namely be dystroyer of your lynage & chyldren: whome ye haue made felowe wt your owne son̄es: & also par∣tyner of yor kyngdome: alas: than shal our stocke & houshold neruer be quyet? Shall we alway betossed & turned in effu∣sion of blode / in batayle / in exyle & in chasing frō our coūtrey. ¶Whyle the Carthaginences raygned in prosperite / we suf∣fred and that paciētly / & nat vndeserued all cruelte & vexacion For them were our ennemies on euery syde of vs: our frendes in whome we shuld haue founde socour at tyme of nede were ferre disioyned & separate from vs. Thus all our hope: all our trust was in our strength & armour. But nowe after that pestilent dystruction of the Carthaginences is chased & casten out of Affrike we cōtinued a tyme ioyfull & quyet: passynge our lyfe in peace and trāquilite / for why we had no ennemy: except paraduēture for any iniury done agaynst you ye wold commaūde vs to take your enmy for ours also / as reason and ryght requyred. But nowe sodaynly & vnwarely to vs: this Iugurth exaltynge hymselfe by his intollerable audacite / by cruelte & pryde hath first slayne my brother & his owne nere kynsmam Hiempsall: & in augmentynge his myschefe hath vsurped to hym as in pray my brothers part & porcion of the kyngdome of Numydy / and after: seynge that he myght nat take me lyke maner of trayne as he had done my brother /
what tyme I douted nothynge lesse than any violence or ba∣tayle in the kyngdome whiche I holde of you / he hath chased me (as ye may se) out of your kyngdome / and hath made me as an abiect outlawe: chased from my coūtrey: and dweyng place / oppressed with pouerty / & laded with miseryes. In so moche that I may be in more suerty & saue garde in any place of the worlde / than in my owne natyfe coūtrey & kyngdome / whiche I holde of you. Forsothe worthy senatours: I haue euer thought in lyke maner as I haue oftentymes herde my father Micipsa openly report with sadnesse: sayeng that they which shuld diligētly cōtynue in your frendshyp by theyr me¦rit{is} / must take great labors at many tymes vpon themselfe in your causes: but of all men they wer most sure from iniury of any man: And sothely all my lynage hath done asmoche as in them was at your desyres: And euer hath ben redy in all ba∣tayls & nedes to assyst you. Wherfore if ye folowe the precept{is} of gratitude: if ye bere in remēbraunce these merites of myne auncetry / it is bothe right & honesty that in this myne extreme necessite / ye ayde & socour me & restore me agayn to quyetnes: whyle ye haue none other busynesses in hand / whiche may be to you īpedimēt ī this enterprise. Moost discret fathers: more brefely & clerly to declare vnto you my cōplaint & my mysery: And also to certify your excellence more playnly of myne vn∣naturall & vnkynd kynsman Iugurth: and of his cruelte. It is nat vnknowen vnto yor mageste: that my father Micipsa after his departyng: left behynde hym vs two brethern his na¦turall & laufull son̄es: supposyng that by his benefytes & me∣rites Iugurth shulde be ioyned with vs / as thyrde brother. But alas: moche cōtrary thone of vs is murdred by this cru∣ell Iugurth / blynded by insaciable ambicion & desyre of do∣minion. And I my selfe the seconde brother skarsly and with great difficulte haue escaped his cruell & vnmercyfull hādes: what may I do? or whether shall I rathest fle for confort vn∣happy exulate thus desolate & infortunate as I am? All the so∣cours all ye cōfort / of my stocke & kynred is extinct by deth my grandfather Massinissa / & my father Micipsa: as necessite hath cōstrayned them: haue payed ye generall tribute of natu∣re: delyuered from these mūdayne vexaciōs by naturall deth. My nere kynsman Iugurth: moch otherwyse than it be came hym to do: hath cursedly bereft my brother of his lyfe by ty∣ranny & myscheuous couetise of dominion: myne other kyns∣men by cōsanguynite & affinite: withall myne other frendes by his cruelte ben also oppressed or put to dethe / some by one meanes & some by other: some of hym be taken captyue: some put to shamefull deth of gybet / galous / or crosse / wt most cruell
tourment: some be casten to wylde & rapinous beestes to be deoured of them. A fewe whiche ar left with theyr lyues / are closed in dongyons & darknes: passyng theyr miserable lyues with mournyng & waylyng more greuous than deth. Thus m I inuyroned with anguysshe on euery syde. But if it wer so: that all these socours whiche I haue lost by cruelte of Iu∣gurth: or if all thyng{is} which be turned to me: from prosperite to aduersite / remayned to this hour hole without detrimēt or dāmage lyke as they were in my best estate: yet certaynly no∣ble senatours: if any yll or mysfortune vnprouided shulde happen vnto me: I durst be bolde to call your ayde and con∣fort. Bycause it semeth you to haue cure of right & wrong be∣longyng to euery man: cōsydryng the excellent magnitude & gretnes of your empire / and to suffre no vertue vnrewarded nor vice vnpunysshed / and finally no wretch oppressed to con¦tynue vndefended. But now moost of all sythe I am exulate from my natyf coūtrey / from the kyngdome which my father ruled vnder you: and from my owne house & dwellyng place / also nedy and poore of all thyng{is} belongynge to myne estate / and alone without company or defence: to whome or to what place may I resorte: or in whome may I call for ayde or con∣forte in these my manyfolde miseries. Shall I resorte or call for socours of nacions / or of kynges adiacent and about the lande of Numydy: alas I shulde lytell preuayle or nought at all. Syth all they for your amyte ioyned with you: be mor∣tall ennemyse to vs & to our lynage: may I resort to any con∣trey about vs: but that I shulde fynde there many tokens of cruelte of warre: which my fathers haue done in theyr tymes passed in your causes. Whyther shall any of them which haue ben our old ennemis / haue mercy or cōpassyon on vs nowe in this our extremite. But finally most noble senatours / my fa∣ther Micipsa thus ordred vs at his departynge: and gaue vs in commaundemēt that we shulde obserue nor mentayne the frendshyppe of none other kyng nor people / saue onely of the people of Rome: and that we shuld seke no newe felowshyp / nor newe confederacions or bondes of cōcorde sayeng that in your frendshyp & helpe: we shuld fynde great socours & ayde and that largely. But if it shuld fortune that ye welth of this your empire shuld fall into ruyne or chāge from this excellēce (whiche the goddes defende) than: sayde he that we and our kyngdome of necessite shulde also decay togyder with you. But now lauded be the goddes by whose helpe & fauour / and by your owne strength & vertue: ye be at this tyme myghty & riche: all thyng to you is prosperous and to your cōmaunde∣ment obeyng. Wherfore it is somoch more laufull / easy and
conuenient to you to take cure & charge in redressyng thin iu∣ries done to yor frendes & felowes. I am onely in drede and dout of this one thynge lest the frendshyp & singulier fauour of Iugurth: nat parfetly knowen as he is worthy: do induce the myndes of some to parcialite agaynst Iustice and ryght. I here & vnderstāde that such labour withall theyr myght for fauour of Iugurth goynge about from man to man / prayng and intreatyng with moche solicitude many of you a part by one & one / desirynge & requiryng you to determine no thynge agaynst Iugurth whyle he is absent: & the mater and cause nat knowen perfetly: I here suche {per}sons corrupt wt parcialite and fauour obiectyng secretly agaynst me / and sayeng that I fayne and ymagyn these wordes to accuse Iugurth vndeser∣uyngly / and yt I fayne to be chased forth of my lande by hym: wher as I myght surely ynough haue remayned within the kyngdome of Numidy. That wold god I myght se ones the cursed & vnkynde kynsman of myne Iugurth / by whose vn∣mercyfull & cruell dedes I am casten in these miseries / in such case: that he were faynyng the same thynges vnder lyke ma∣ner as I fayne them at this tyme: and wolde god I myght ones se hym as truely wtout faynyng dryuen out of ye land of Numidy / as I am nowe chased from the same by his cruelty: and wolde god yt at last other ye or els the immortall goddes wold so care for ye busynesses & troubles of vs myserable men in erth: that ye same Iugurth which now bereth hȳselfe proud of his synfull dedes shewyng hymselfe & countyng hym noble onely bycause he escapeth vnpunyssed for his syn̄e & cruelte: myght therfore suffre greuous punysshmēt wtall my miseries & other myscheues & yls / acordyng to his deseruynge: for his vnmercyfull cruelte shewed agaynst our father Micipsa / in murdryng of my dere brother Hiempsall / & chasyng me forth of my natyfe coūtre: thus oppressed wt all miseries in extreme necessite. O my brother my brother Hiempsall / most dere to my hart of all creatures: howbeit nowe thy lyfe is bereft the in thy flouryng youth / longe before thy naturall hour of deth: and yt by cruelte of hym / whome it semed nat of all men so to haue done: neuertheles me thynketh in my mynd this chaūce of thy deth more to be ioyned of: than to be sorowed. For thou hast nat onely lost thy lyfe & thy kyngdome: but also thou hast escaped this chasynge / this flyght / this exyle / this nede / this pouerty withall other wretchednesses & miseries / whiche op∣presseth me wtout cōfort or socours. But I vnhappy & misera¦ble exulate thus throwen downe from my fathers kyngdome into so many yls & so great myseries / may welbe an example and spectacle to al ye world of the mutable courses wherin for∣tune
turneth mankynd. O my dere brother vncertayne am I what I do: whyther I thus distitute of socour and ayde: may persecute and reueng thy iniuries & thy deth / or els whether I may prouide and seke socours for recoueryng of the lande of Numidy. I am in that case: that my lyfe & deth dependeth in the socour of other men. Wold god I were deed out of hande: if deth myght be an honest conclusion of these my miserable misfortunes: rather than to be counted as content & pleased to lyue in rebuke and shame / as an exulate weryed & ouercom with iniuries: and gyueng place to the iniust cruelte of tyran¦nous persecucion / and as nat able nor bolde to resist the same. But nowe certaynly it is agaynst my wyll that I lyue / for in my lyfe I haue no lyking nor pleasure / and yet can I nat dye without dishonour. Wherfore moost prudent fathers & noble senatours: these premisses consydred: I obtest & humbly re∣quyre you: in honour of the goddes immortall: for thaunciēt amyte bytwene you and my forefathers: for the naturall loue whiche ye haue agaynst your chyldren & parentes and by the mageste of the people of Rome: & this your most excellent em∣pire: haue pyte of my manyfolde calamitees & socour this my misery. Resist this tyrannous dealyng & iniury of Iugurth commytted nat onely agaynst my wretched persone: but also agaynst you and your empire. Suffre nat the kyngdome of Numidy: which is your owne: to decay and be distroyed by cruell tyranny of Iugurth / and by the effusion of blode and murdre of the linage of Massinissa / somtyme most faythfull and constant frende of this your empire. ¶Howe the embassadours of Iugurth replyed agaynst these wordes of Adherball: & what dy∣reccion was taken for bothe parties of the sena∣tours of Rome. ¶The .xi. chapter. AFter that Adherball / in forme aboue writen had ended his complaynt: anone the em∣bassadours of Iugurth arose & answerd brefely in fewe wordes: as they whiche had more trust & confidence in theyr great gyftes gyuen before to many of the rulers of Rome: than in any right of theyr cause and thus they replyed in effecte: sayeng before the senatours that Hiempsall was slayne of the Numidyans for his owne hastines & cruelte / and nat by knowlege of Iugurth: and as touchyng Adherball: he began warr agaynst Iugurth of his owne froward mynd without any occasion: but after he was
ouercome in batayle / bycause he was nat able to reueng hym selfe / nor to make his partie good / he fled vnto Rome to com∣playne hym to the senators of Iugurth: where as all ye faute was in hymselfe and in none other / concernyng the partie of Iugurth: they requyred the senatours in his behalfe in his absence to count hym none other / than he was {pro}ued & knowen in the warre of Numance: and that they wold nat set more by the wordes of his ennemy / than by his dedes magnificently proued. This sayd: anone after: bothe parties de{per}ted in son∣der from the court. Immediatly the senatours toke coūsell what best was to be done in the cause. The fauourers of Iu∣gurth & of his embassadours / and more ouer a great part of the senatours were corrupt before by parcialite / fauour / and reward{is} of Iugurth / and so deprauat: that they contemned & set at nought ye wordes of Adherball / exaltyng & cōmendyng the manhode of Iugurth: with laude / fauour / coūtenaunce / voyce / and all other signes: And so finally they laboured by all maner of meanes for an others myscheuous vice & cruell cryme to defende the same: as if it had ben in defence of theyr owne honour / worshyp / & honeste. But on the other part were a fewe other / whiche set more by iustice and honeste / than by false goten riches: these counselled to socour Adherball and sharply to punysshe & reuēge the deth of Hiēpsal. But among all other of this opinion: was one named Emilius Scaurus a man of noble byrth redy to disturbe euery busynes / debatful & besy: desirous of power / of authorite / of honour & of riches: but crafty in clokyng of these his fautes. After this Emilius Scaur{us} sawe his gyueng of brybes of Iugurth so shamfully & openly knowen: he fered lst ye corrupcion of the senatours & heed rulers of Rome myght ingēder enuy / debate & slaughter bytwene them & the cōmens / lyke as in suche cases often had fortuned ī tymes before. Wherfore in this cōsideracion / he re∣frayned his mynde at this tyme from his accustomed vnlau∣full lustes. Neuertheles among ye senators in this coūsell the worst part preuayled: and yt part which set more by fauour & rewardes than by right & equite / ouercam ye other part / which labured to sustayne ye right wtout any fauour or parcialite. And so the fauourers of Iugurth optayned theyr purpose / & his cruelte had no punysshmēt. Neuertheles it was cōcluded & decreed that .x. embassadors shuld be sent into Numidy to diuide ye kyngdome which longed to Micipsa bytwene Iu∣gurth & Adherbal. The principal of this embassade was one named Lucius Opimius a man of noble fame / of great au∣thorite & power among the senatours in those dayes: what ty¦me Caius Gracchus & Marcus Fuluius great fauourers of
the cōmens: were slayne of the noble men of Rome for ye same cause: After victory of the noble men agaynst the cōmens & the same two princes: this Lucius Opimius enraged greuously wt rigorous & sharpe inquisicions & examinaciōs agaynst the poore cōmente: And was one of the chefe oppressers of them. What tyme this Lucius Opimi{us} wt his cōpany was come to Numidy: Iugurth prepared to attempt his old craftes: And howbeit he had founde the same Lucius for one of his enne∣mies at Rome / neuertheles he receyued hym worshypfully & with great diligēce. And wt gyueng & {pro}misyng many thyng{is} he brought his purpose so to effect / that this Lucius at cōclu∣sion preferred the fauour & profet of Iugurth before his owne good name & fidelite: & brefely: before all thyng{is} belongyng to hymselfe. This brought to passe: anone he went in hand wt the other of ye embassadors after the same way: & many of thē he wan & ouercāe with gyftes. very fewe of them were which set more by theyr fayth & treuth than by money & rewardes of Iugurth. Wherfore whā it was come to limitacion & separa¦cion of the lande of Numidy / bytwene Adherball & Iugurth as the sayd embassadors were cōmaunded of the senatours: that part of the kyngdome which marched toward Mauri∣tany / or the lande of the Mauriens beyng most opulent and plentyfull of fruitfull fyldes and of men / was gyuen to Iu∣gurth: but the other part / which was more pleasant than {pro}fi∣table as ornate without hauyn townes and fayre edifyces: was cōmytted to possession of Adherball. ¶Nowe for asmoche as in this hystory before & most of all in sequele and {pro}cesse of the same / hath & shalbe made mencion of many places & townes of Affrike: to thintent that thystory may be more clere and euident / me thynketh it requisite and conuenient brefely to describe the sytuacion of Affrike: and a lytell to touche those peoples and countreis / whiche with the romayns had at any tyme amite or frenshyp / other peace or warre. But suche places and nacions whiche for heat and wyldernes be lytell frequented of people / or nat inhabited: of them it is nat easy to describe nor declare the truth: for by difficulte of the places / fewe or none resorteth thyder perfetly to knowe the same. But the other partes frequented of people I shall as brefely declare as can be touched. ¶The descripcion of the habitable parties of the countrey of Affrike / namely of suche nacions as had amyte or warre with the Romayns. ¶The .xii. chapter.
IN diuision of the circle of the worlde the opinion of most writers is: that it is diuided into thre partes / Europe / Asy / & Affrike. A fewe other authours hold opinion: that it is deuided onely into two partes / that is to say Asy & Eu∣rope: so that vnder climate of ye part whiche is called Euro∣pe: the thirde part named Affrike is cōprehēded. But this last opinion is leest alowed. This countrey of Affrike hath his bondes on the see of Italy on the West part / and on the occean see it abordeth partly on the same syde: on the Est part therof is a declinyng & pendant valey tyght ample & large. Thinha¦bytaūtes of this valey call it Cathabathmon in theyr affrike langage: that is to say in englyssh / a dependāt valey. On this Est syde: the see is outragyous / cruell / perilous & wtout any sure hauen: but the fyldes & soyle on this part ar plentyfull of corne / and for all maner beestes is good pasture / but the soyle is nat apt to trees beryng frute: of water is scarcite / bothe of rayne water / & of water springyng of the erth. The disposi∣cion of the people is holsome of body / swyft / & may well en∣dure labour. Insomoche that the most part dye for extreme age / saue suche as be slayne wt wepyn / or deuoured of wylde beest{is}. For it is nat often sene ye corruption of humours ingen¦dring any infirmite bryngeth to deth. In this coūtrey be also many rauynous beestes & of diuers kyndes / deuourynge all thyng which they may ouercome. But this omityng I wyll nowe brefely declare what maner people first of all inhabited this countrey of Affrike / and what people thyther resorted to inhabite next after them. And howe thesame peoples were myngled togyder. Howebeit that whiche I shall write is moche diuers from the commen fame and opinion of many men: neuerthelesse / I shall folowe the bokes writen in Affri∣ke langage / which (as it is sayd) belonged to the yong prince Hiempsall: whome Iugurth murdred: of the same bokes I shall folowe the true interpretacion in this mater / and lyke as the inhabitauntes of the same countrey afferme to be true. But touchynge the very credence of the treuth of the mater I report that to the authours. ¶The first people whiche inhabited the countrey of Affrike were named Getulians & Lybeās / a people hard / sharpe & vn¦manerd. These lyued of flesshe of wyld beest{is} / & fedde vpon ye groūde as beest{is} vnresonable. And were nat ruled by any ma¦ners / but lyued wtout lord or lawes / as vagabūdes & rouers. They had no certayn byding plac{is} / but wher as ye nyght toke thē: ther they rested for ye tyme. But after yt Hercules dyed in Hispayne / as the Affricās say: his army which was assēbled
of dyuers nacions / whan their captayne and heed was lost: dispersed themselfe abrode anone after his deth / and came to dyuers places of the worlde to seke theyr fortune / where they myght optayne any habitacion or lordshyppe. Of whiche company / the Medeans / Perseans / and Armenyans arriued with theyr shyppes in that coost of Affrike / which was nerest to the empire of Rome / and longe tyme after occupied those costes. But the Persyans inhabited themselfe more inwarde in the countrey towarde the occean see: and in stede of houses they tourned theyr shyppes botomes vpwarde and dwelled vnder the same. And no maruayle / for in the countre about them grewe no tymber nor other stuffe mete for buyldynge / nor of the Spanyard{is} which inhabited next to them / neyther myght they bye nor borowe. For the see was so great & tempe¦stous bytwene them / and theyr langages so dyuers & vnkno∣wen to eyther people / that by these two īpedimētes they were letted from the cors of marchādise or exchāges bytwene thē. These Persiens by meane of mariages by lytell & lytell men∣gled the Getulyans wt them / and bycause they proued oftenty¦mes the cōmodite of theyr grounde & feldes by often cōmuta∣cions & chaungyng{is} one with other / at last they named them∣selfe Numidyās / that is to say herdmen deuided. And to this present daye the cotages or tylmens houses be made longe wt croked sydes or couertures bowyng inwarde as if they were helyes of shyppes trāsuersed or turned vp set downe. Tow∣chyng ye Medeans & Armenyns they ioyned themselfe wt the Libyēs. For these Medeans & Armeniēs dwelled before mo∣re nere to the see of Affrike. The Getulyans inhabited more nere to ye son̄e rising: nat farre frō the feruent coūtrey of Inde and this people anone had rowmes & dwelling places / for the see bytwene them & Hispayne was but narowe / wherfor they agreed with the Hispaniardes to make exchanges & bartyn∣ges of marchādyse with them. The Lybiens corrupted theyr name by lytell and lytell changyng the same / & at last in stede of Medyans named thēselfe Mauriēs by barbarike {pro}nun∣ciacion of theyr langage. But the welth & riches of the Per∣siens in short tyme increased and multiplied. In somoch that after they had named themselfe Numidyans / they increased in so great multitude: that theyr fyrst coūtrey was nat able to norysshe them all: So that afterwarde many of the yong and lusty people departed in sonder from theyr frendes & last their countrey / resortynge to a countrey nere the cite of Carthage / vacant at that tyme: In whiche countrey the inhabited them selfe and named it Numidy after theyr name. Shortely after this: bothe they whiche remayned styll in theyr first countrey
and these which remoued thens / assisted one an other withall maner of helpe & socours. Insomoche that what by strength and what by fear they brought vnder theyr subieccion and do¦minion suche other nacions as marched nere them: so that within shorte tyme they moche inhaunced & augmented their name and glory / but most namely they which inhabited that part of Affrike / whiche is ouer agaynst Italy and nere the Italyan see / these most increased in welth and honour. For the Lybiens were nat so good men of warre as the Getu∣lians or Numydyans. And so all the inward part of Affrike was for the most part in possession of the Numidyans / and so moche dyd they: that all the nacions of them subdued were called Numidyans after the name of ouercomers. Nowe haue we declared howe the Getulians and Lybiās were first inhabitaūtes of Affrike: and howe the Perseans / Medeans / and Armenyens came afterwarde and ioyned with them. Howe the Perseans named themselfe Numidyans. And the Medeans and Armenyens by corrupcion of langage were called Mauriens. ¶And nowe cōsequently I shall declare what other people came afterwarde and inhabited the same lande of Affrike. After all these nacions before rehersed: out of ye land of Phe∣nyce came moche people to inhabite themselfe in Affrike. Some bycause their owne countrey was nat sufficient to su∣stayne so great a multitude as were of them. And other some great men of byrth & desyrous of lordshyp raysed vp & assem∣bled the nedy cōmen people & left their owne coūtrey: in hope to fynd some other greater dominion els where / and in {pro}cesse of tyme aryued at ye lande of Affrike: and there buylded thre cities vpon the see coost named Hippona / Adrumentum and Leptis: with other dyuers cities: but nat so great & famous as these were. These cities in short tyme were so augmēted & increased that some of them were honour / and some socoure & ayde to their originall coūtreis. But of the cite of Carthage which also by them was buylded / and afterwarde became the heed cite of Affrike: me thynke it is better to passe ouer wt sci∣lence: than of it to speke a lytell & than to leue the mater in the myddes vnparfet / & also this my busynes {pro}cedeth to an other purpose. Neuerthelesse somwhat shall I touche the first foun¦dacion of this cite of Carthage / nat folowyng myne authour Salust: which wryteth nothynge therof: but folowynge the opinion of Vergil as he wryteth in the first boke of Eneas. ¶The quene Dydo doughter of Belus kyng of the land of Cypre and wyfe to Sycheus kynge of Phenyce: fledde with her shyppes laded with golde & other ryches out of her owne
coūtrey: dredyng ye cruelte of her brother Pygmalion: which blynded by couetyse and ambicyon had slayne her husbande Sicheus by treason. This Dido at last aryued wit her ship∣pes & company at the coost of Affricke / where rayned a kyng named Hierbas: which moued with beaute of Dido desyred her to wyfe. But for loue whiche she had to her first husbande Sicheus she wold nat cōsent therto by any meanes: but desy¦red to bye of the same kynge Hierbas as moche ground as myght be cōpassed about with hyde of a bull. And after that it was graūted / she cut the hyde of a bull so small / that with the same she cōpassed thre myle of groūde in compasse. In which space & circuite she bylded a cite: which first was named Byr¦sa. After in proces of tyme it was called Tyros: and last of all Carthage / vnder whiche name by long continuance so am∣ply it encreased in fame and welth: that it contayned .xxiiii. myles in cōpasse. But whan it was in most excellence it was vtterly distroied by the romains Publius Scipio Affricane that tyme beyng captayne of the romayne army. Touchynge the foundacion of this famous cite of Carthage / somoche haue I written more than myne authour Salust. But nowe wyll I returne to myne institute & purpose cōcernyng the dy¦scripcion of Affrike / & brefely bryng it to cōclusion. The va∣ley of whom I spake before named in Affrike lāgage Catha¦bathmon / deuided the coūtrey of Affrike from Egypt on that syde saue that an arme of the see is bytwene the first cite or ha¦bitacion of Affrike towarde this valey / & is called Cyrene. And nere to the same be other two cites / the one named Tolo∣nia / ye other Thercon: beyond these thre cities be two quick∣sādes / & bytwene bothe ye sādes a cite named Leptis. Beyond this cite of Leptis / is a place named of the romains Phyleno∣rum are in englysshe: the auters of two bretherne called Phi∣lenis / bycause these two brethern suffred thēselfe to be quicke buryed in the same place for the cōmen wele of theyr coūtrey: wherof thy story herafter shalbe written at more oportunite. This place diuideth the dominion of Carthage from Egypt on that syde. After this place on the syde costes be other cities belongynge to the dominyon of Punike. All the places from thens forthe to Mauritany or lande of the Mauriens / be vnder subieccion of the Numydyans. The Mauriens haue theyr habytacyon nere to Hispayne. But as we rede: the Ge¦tulyans haue theyr habitacion beyond the Numidyās: some in poore lodgys: and some other more vylely without habi∣tacion wandrynge as vagabūdes. Beyond these Getulyans is the lande of Ethyope: and from thens forthe be coūtreis so brent with feruour of the sonne that they be inhabitable.
But duryng this warre bytwene the romayns and Iugurth: the romains had in theyr possession many townes of Punike and moche of the costes of thempyre of Carthage: and ruled the same by officers vnder them therto assigned. A great part of Numydy and of the Getulyans vnto a flodde named Mu¦lucham: was vnder the dominion of Iugurth. Ouer all the Maurians raygned one kyng named Bocchus: of whome the romayns had no knowlege saue of his name onely. And before this batayle: he was nother in peace nor in warre ac∣quaynted / nor knowen of the romayns. Of Affrike & of thin∣habitaūtes of the same: ynough is spoken and as moche as is requysite of necessite to the processe of this hystory. Nowe wyll I make regression and prosecute my first purposed ma∣ter insuyng myne authour Salust. ¶How Iugurth inuaded the kyngdome of Ad∣herball yet ones agayn: and how Adherball agayne was ouercome in batayle: & put to flyght. ¶The .xiii. chapter. AFter the embassadours of Rome: of whome I haue spoken before: had diui∣ded the realme of Numidy bytwene Ad∣herball & Iugurth / and were departed out of Affrike towarde Rome: anone Iugurth reuoulued in mynde howe he had escaped vnpunisshed for his crueltie otherwyse thā his mynde feared before: And how in stede of punysshement: for his syn̄e: he was rewarded with ye better part of the lande of Numidy. Nowe he consydred that all was true whiche his frendes had tolde hym before whyle he was in Hispayne with the romayne army in the warre of Numance: that is to say. That nothynge was so false & iniust: but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for money / for all thyng myght be bought therefor money. This consideracion inhaunced his mynde vnto esperance & that nat a lytell. Forthermore he was infla∣med with the large promesses of them: whome he had acloyed before with gyftes & rewardes at Rome: In somoche that agayne of newe he fixed his mynde to inuade & vsurpe the kyngdome of Adherball / and by some poynt of prodicion to take hym in trap as he had done Hiempsall his brother. This Iugurth was fiers / sharpe / & apte to warr well inured with thesame & expert ī feates therof: but cōtrarely Adherbal: whome he assayled & pursued: was a mete man & oportune to
take iniury / more ferefull and dredyng other / than to be drad of other. Wherfore sodenly / and without any prouision on party of Adherball: Iugurth inuaded the marches of his kyngdome / with a great power & multitude of men of armes / many of thinhabitantes he murdred / and many toke he pri∣soners with beestes & all other maner of prayes / robbyng and spoyling euery where: as ferre as his army dis{per}sed / townes / castels and other edifyces he brent & beat downe: and many other places he assayled and inuaded more inwardly in the coūtrey by excourses of his horsemen. This done he returned into his countrey with all his multitude / prayes & prisoners: supposynge that Adherball moued with angre & displeasure wold reuenge these iniuries / and that thyng shulde be cause & occasion of open warre bytwene them. But Adherball adui∣sed hymselfe well: by remembraunce of his first batayle had with Iugurth that he was nat able to contende with hym in batayle nor with force of armes: and more ouer  he had more cōfidence & trust in frendshyp of the Romayns / than in the in∣constāt Numidyans / which leaned more to his ennemy than to hym. These thynges consydred: he send embassadours to Iugurth to complayne of these iniuries: But these embassa∣dours had nought els of hym but contumelious / proude and hasty wordes. And so dispised of Iugurth returned agayn to theyr lord Adherball: though suche answers myght haue mo∣ued any coragious hert: neuerthelesse Adherball determined in mynde: to suffre all thynges and to take many iniuries pa¦ciently: rather than agayn to begyn batayle with Iugurth. For (as sayd is) the batayle foughten before bytwene them was bothe to dishonour & also great dammage. But for all this suffrance of Adherball: the mynde of Iugurth was nat more pacified / nor lessed of his cruelte. The pacience of Ad∣herball abated nat the Ire of Iugurth: but it augmēted: For all redy he had cōcluded in mynde to inuade ye hole kyngdōe of Numidy. Therfore he began agayn of newe: nat as before with a cōpany of reuers / but with a myghty and great army assembled togyder demeanyng open warre / and chalangyng openly the hole empire of Numidy / and with such power pro¦ceded into the land of Adherball: wastyng the townes & fyld{is} on euery syde / dryuing away prayes of catell & other riches: and increasyng corage to his men / and drede to his ennemis. Whan Adherball sawe it was come to that point that he must nedes other abandon and gyue ouer his kyngdome / or els mayntayne it with force of armes / as he which was constray∣ned by extreme necessite: he assembled & empareyled an army aswell as he myght / and with thesame proceded forth to mete
Iugurth. At last the two hoostes of Adherball & of Iugurth approched & rested nere togyder / besyde a towne named Cir∣tha / nat ferre distant from the seecoost / and for asmoch as the day drewe nere to nyght: the batayle was nat anone begon: but eyther party remayned in theyr tentes. Anone after moch of the nyght was ouerpassed / and the starre lyght somwhat dymmed wt obscurite of cloud{is}. The soudiours of Iugurth raysed by the sounde of trūpettes vnwarly & sodenly inuaded and assayled the tentes & felde of Adherball: some they mur∣dred halfe slepynge: & some other they flewe whyle they were in hande to arme themselfe. On part of Adherball was pete∣full murdre: and on syde of Iugurth no mercy / but abstinat persecucion & vengeaūce: and so fiersly fought Iugurth and his cōpany that shortly Adherbal fled to the towne of Cirtha / acōpanyed with a fewe horsmen. But Iugurth pursued hym so nerely / that if the inhabitantes of the towne of Cirtha in hast & with great multitude had nat receyued Adherball / and with force of armes defended the walles / & kept forth the sou∣dyours of Iugurth whiche persued Adherball: the batayle bytwene them both shuld haue begon & ended that one same day / and that to destruction of Adherball. But Iugurth per∣ceyuyng the entre into the towne denyed to hym / anone bese∣ged it on euery syde with all maner ingynes inuasyue to his ennemies / and defensyue to his company: he caused hastely to be framed large pauayses and towres of tymbre to be dryuen vpon whelis toward the walles of the towne. And with these and all maner other ingynes went in hande fiersly to assayle the towne: and somoch more hastely he sped hym / to thintēt to bryng his purpose to effect / before any embassadors shuld cōe from Rome to resyst his enterprise. For asmoche as before this batayle he had herd that Adherball had sende embassa∣dours to Rome to certify the senators of his miserable state. ¶Howe the fauourers of Iugurth at Rome la∣boured so in his cause / that thre yong men inexpert and wtout policy were send embassadors into Affrike to cesse this stryfe bytwene the two kynges: and howe these embassadours re∣tourned to Rome without any thyng done ¶The .xiiii. chapter. BVt after the senatours at Rome herd tidynges of this batayle / they send into Affrike thre yonge gentylmen in embassade / cōmaun∣dyng them to go to bothe the kynges / & to com∣maund them in behalfe of the senatours and of the hole people of Rome to cesse theyr warre / and to shewe
them that the senate and Romayns wylled and vtterly com∣maunded them so to do. And so doyng / they shuld do as it se∣med them: and as of cōgruence they ought to do both for plea∣sure of the Romayns & for theyr owne honour & profet. The embassadours with suche cōmaundement hasted them and came vnto Affrike / the senatours had commaunded them to make somoche more expedicion in theyr iourney / bycause ty∣dyng{is} were brought to Rome / whan these embassadours pre∣pared themselfe forward: how the batayle was done bytwene Adherball & Iugurth / and how Iugurth kept Adherball be∣seged straytly within the towne of Cirtha. But this rumour was somwhat alayed & kept secrete by fauourers of Iugurth / after these embassadors were come to Numidy: they expres∣sed to Iugurth theffect of theyr embassade / in forme as the se∣natours had cōmaunded them. Whan Iugurth vnderstode the pleasur of the senatours by theyr wordes & embassade: he answered benignely / sayeng that he counted no erthly thyng more great / nor excellent / nor more dere vnto hym than the au¦thorite of the senatours & people of Rome / and that from his yougth to that tyme he had euer so indeuored to order hymself that euery good & worshypfull man cōmended & alowed hym for his vertu & manhode / and nat for malyce nor mysdemea∣nour. And for the same manlynes & nat for malicious dedes / nor for disordred maners his cōpany and conuersacion was accept and pleasour vnto the ryght hygh & worthy captayne Publius Scipio. Moreouer: for the same cōuersacion and good maners & nat for faute of chyldren naturall / his vncle Micipsa had adopted hym for his son̄e: and made hym inhe∣ritour of his kyngdome / partiner wt his owne naturall son∣nes: and for asmoch as he had demeaned hymselfe ryght well and worthely / in executynge of many hygh & glorious inter∣prises: somoch the lesse coude he suffre iniury done vnto hym vnreuenged. As touchyng Adherball Iugurth alleged for hymselfe that this Adherball by gyle & treason lay in wayt to slee hym: which thyng perceyued: he made resystence agaynst the same to the best of his power / as any man was bounde to do for sauegard of his owne lyfe. And if the romayns wolde prohybit & deny that vnto hym / whiche Iustice permytted to euery man (that is / with violence to resyst & repell violence) than shulde they neyther do well nor ryght wysely in that be∣halfe. Whan Iugurth had answered the embassadours after this maner: than sayd he for conclusion that shortly after he wold send embassadours to certify the senatours of all other thynges cōcernyng this busynes: and on this poynt Iugurth and the embassadours departed in sonder. Thus Adherball
had no confort nor lycence to reply agaynst the wordes of Iu¦gurth / nor syght or cōmunicacion with the embassadours: all onely was it graunted vnto hym to appelle to ye court of Ro∣me / for of these embassadours coude he haue / no iustice / nor dyreccion / in his iniuries and persecucion. Whan Iugurth thought that thembassadours were passed forth of Affrike / toward Rome / and whan he sawe yt with force of armes he coud nat wynne the towne of Cirtha / bycause of naturall sy∣tuacion & difficulte of the place. Anone he besiged the towne agayn of newe and all difficultes nat withstādyng / he made a profounde & depe trench rounde about the towne with sharpe stakes & payles stycked on hyghest part of the same trenches with sharpe pykes on their vpper end{is}. This dyde Iugurth for many cōsyderacions: first to thintent that the inhabitātes shuld nat breke forth of the towne sodenly at any syde vpon any part of his soudyours whiche besiged them. Secondly to thintent yt on no part any vitayles shulde be brought into them. Thirdly that the men of warre within the towne shuld nat thrust forth without ye towne the multitude of poore com∣mens in tyme of famyne & scarcite of vitayls. And fourthly: that no socours shuld entre into them to rescue the towne nor to supply theyr garyson. Whan this trenche was made & fy∣nisshed Iugurth moreouer made strong bulwarkes & towres of tymber without the towne / & strengthed the same with ga∣ryson of wyght & bolde men of armes. Bysyde all these ordi∣naūces he left nothynge vnassayed / nother spared he to attēpt euery thyng by strength nor by treason & gyle. Somtyme he proued ye watchmen & defenders of ye walles with gyftes exci∣tyng them to betray the towne. Whan his rewardes auayled nought than he thretned them with fiers & sharpe wordes: he inhaunced by exortacions the mynd{is} & courages of his owne men to manlynes & audacite. And so he aplyed his busynesse that nothyng he omytted wont or possible to be done in such a case / nor no ingyne of warre laft he vnprouided which ī those dayes was cōtriued or found: but rather besyde all old inuen¦cyons he ymagined & deuysed newe ingynes & ordinaūces of warre nat sene before that tyme / and all for distruccion of the towne of Cirtha / and of Adherball whome he besyged with∣in the same. But what tyme Adherball consydred his fortune come to extremite on all part{is} / he kest many thyng{is} in mynde. On the one syde he perceyued his ennemy Iugurth violent agaynst hym / and no trust of cōfort of socours. On the other syde he cōsydred well / that for penury & want of soudyours & other thynges necessary he was nat able nother to fyght with his ennemy / nor to dryue forth or prolong the batayle: and for
faute of vytayle he myght nat long defende the towne. These thynges with many mo well reuoulued in mynde / he chose forthe two which were most diligent and trusty of that com∣pany which had fled with hym into Cirtha. To them he wo∣fully be wayled his misfortune: and made so large promysses of rewardes vnto them: that at last he induced them to go forthe of the towne by nyght priuely / and if they myght escape theyr ennemis / to resort to the next hauyn towne: and from thens to hast them to Rome with letters whiche he had deui∣sed and written to be delyuerd to the senators. These messan∣gers were trusty & faythfull / within fewe dayes without any dysturbance: they fulfylled the commaundement of theyr so∣ueraygne / and delyuerd the letters of Adherball vnto the se∣natours. Which letters anone were redde in the counselhous before the senatours and rulers of Rome: of which letters the sentence hereafter insueth and was suche. ¶The sentēce of the letters sent from Adherball vnto the senatours of Rome: what tyme he lay beseged by Iugurth within the towne of Cirtha. ¶The .xv. chapter. MOost worthy fathers it is nat througth my faute that I sende so often to you requi¦ryng your socours / and cōplaynyng myne iniuryes: but the violence & rygour of Iu∣gurth / cōpelleth me therto. Whose mynde is fylled with so great a lust and desyre to beraue my lyfe: yt neyther hath he in mynde the drede of goddes punysshmēt / nor fear of your displeasur. My blode he coueyteth more than all thynges: In somoche that nowe is the .v. moneth sith I am kept closed / & besiged wt armed men / by tyranny of Iugurth. He nothyng regardyng that I am cōfederate felowe & frende of the people of Rome. Neyther can preuayle nor helpe ye great benefites of my fader Micipsa done to this Iugurth / nor your authorite nor ordy∣naunces or decrees. I am vncertayn whyther I am constra∣ned & oppressed more greuously by force of armes or by hun∣ger / for bothe inuolueth me on all sydes / I wolde write vnto you moch more touchyng the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth but my miserable fortune moueth me cōtrary: and moreouer I haue often {per}ceyued before this tyme: that small credence is gyuen to such as ar oppressed with misery: Saue this I per¦ceyue clerely that the mynde of Iugurth coueyteth greater
thyng than my deth or kyngdome. And if by your sufferan∣ce: he shall subdue me and beraue me kyngdom / at last he shall ryse and rebell agaynst your empyre. Wherfore if ye lyst nat to defende & socour my lyfe: at leest: defende your kyngdome of Numidy / and preuent the vsurper of your empire. Suffre nat this tyran to enioye the kyngdome of Numidy / and your good wyll withal. But truely ye may well perceyue that he loketh nat after your fauour / after he shal haue vsurped the realme of Numidy. But whyder he setteth lesse by losse of your frenshyp and fauour / or of the dominion of Numidy: none is so blynde but that may euidently perceyue the trouth. For his dedes declare: that he counteth lesse greuous to haue your hygh displeasur / than to lose his fiers purpose to fle me / and than to ocupy the hole lande of Numidy. For this hath he proued and made manifest by his vnnaturall and cruell dedes: first of all he hath slayne my brother Hiempsall: which dede he durst nat haue done if he had feared your displeasur: next that: he droue me forth of my coūtrey and fathers kyng∣dome. But these iniuries for certayne / were done agaynst my brother and me / and nothyng they longed to you. But nowe he conspyreth hyer inuadyng / vsurpyng / and wastyng the hole lande of Numidy with force of armes. And where as ye set me as your lewtenant vnder you to gouerne a part of Nu¦midy. This Iugurth nowe hath dryuen me from my liberte into the towne of Cirtha / and besegeth me with men of armes closed on all sydes with outwarde drede and inward famine: So that my peryls may playnly declare how lytell he setteth by the wordes of your embassadours. Certaynly I can se nothyng remaynyng able to remoue his violence / nor that can socour this my misery / saue onely your power and vio∣lence. I wolde ryght gladly: that these thynges whiche nowe I write to you / and all those thyng{is} which I haue complay∣ned before in the counselhouse were but fayned & false / rather than this my euident misery shulde proue them true & credi∣ble vnto you. But sith I was borne in that hour / and my de∣steny is such that Iugurth moost manifest his cursed cruelte by me / therfore now my request nor prayer is nat that I may escape the sharpnes and cruelte of miserable deth / whiche I beholde instant and ineuitable / but onely my prayer is that I may escape the long subieccion and bondage of my ennemy: and prolonged tourment{is} of my miserable body. But worthy fathers: touchyng the kyndome of Numidy / which apertay∣neth to you: prouide you for the same as it lyketh you / and if it be your pleasure: ryd and delyuer me from the cruell & vn∣mercyfull handes of Iugurth my mortall enmy for the ho∣nour
and mageste of your empyre / and for the fidelite of all frenshyp / yf any remembraunce of my grandfather Massi∣nissa remayneth yet among you. ¶Howe the senatours sēde newe embassadours to Iugurth / commaundynge him to desyst from {per}secucion of Adherball: and howe they preuay∣led nothyng: how the towne of Cyrtha was yel∣ded to Iugurth: and howe he slewe Adherball. ¶The .xvi. chapter. AFter these foresayde letters were openly red & recyted before ye senators: ma∣ny of them wer: which coūsayled to send an army into Affrike / & in all hast cōuenient to socour & helpe Adherball. And in ye meane tyme they wold take counsell & aduise tou∣ching Iugurth what shuld be done to hym: bycause he had nat obeyed theyr embassadors. Whan the fa∣uourers of Iugurth herd of this they laboured withall theyr myght: that no such decre shulde be made nor {pro}cede to effect. And thus ye cōmen wele was ouercome & subdued by pryuate profet & parciall fauour: as in many other busynesses is dayly wont to happen. Nat withstandyng this parcialite: at last it was so determined: that other new embassadors wer sent yet ones agayn into Affrike / nat yong men & inexpert as before: but well aged men of grauite and discression whiche were of great dignite: & had borne great & worshypfull offices ī tyme past in the cite of Rome. Amonge which embassadours was one named Marcus Emilius Scaurus / of whome we haue made mencion before. This Scaurus was a man by riches & fame coūted able to be coūsellour of Rome: and also at that tyme a myghty prince & great doer among the senators / & in maner ruler of them all. For asmoch as all men for the moost part were displeased wt Iugurth & sore murmured agaynst his cruelte & agaynst ye parciall fauour shewed to hym at Ro∣me: & also for that ye messāgers of Iugurth besought the em∣bassadors to hast them to Numidy / therfore ye third day after theyr cōmission they de{per}ted from Italy / & toke shyppyng & in short tyme after aryued in Affrike / at a cite named Vtica in a prouince subiect to the romains. Assone as they were aryued they sende letters vnto Iugurth chargyng hym in all hast to cōme to the sayd prouince to knowe the pleasure of the sena∣tours of Rome whiche had sende them thyder for the nonys with certen commaundementes dyrect vnto hym.
of al theyr counsels & busynesses. And howbeit at begynnyng this same Scaurus strongly resisted the party of Iugurth: what tyme many other of his sect were corrupt and accloyed wt bribes long before this: neuertheles now at last his mynde was abstract lyke other mo from the defence of goodnes and honesty vnto his olde vice of insaciable & execrable couetyse by meane of habundance of gold and great rewardes of Iu∣gurth. But at first begynnyng this Iugurth redemed of Cal¦phurnius / but onely delayng and deferryng of the warre: tru¦styng that in meane tyme he shuld brynge about somwhat of his purpose at Rome other by price / prayer / or fauour. But nowe after he had won Scaurus to be partiner of his busy∣nes and fauourer of his cause also with Calphurnius: he was brought into a very great trust fully to recouer his peace at Rome: and concluded whyle both Calphurnius & Scaurus were there present togyder to take aduisemēt & treat presētly with them of all apoyntmēt & thyng{is} necessary to be done for {per}fourmyng of his purpose. Howbeit he trusted nat Calphur¦nius so moche that he wolde come to his army / except some hostag{is} of the Romayns were left within some strong towne of his: & in warde of his people wherby he myght trust with∣out dāmage sauely to be remitted agayn to his army. Cal∣phurnius to auoyd this dougth of Iugurth & to put hym in more assurance send the treasourer of the Romayne army na¦med Sextius / vnto one of the chefe townes belongyng to Iu¦gurth called Vacca / faynyng amonge the army that he sent the sayd treasourer thyther for prouision of whete & other vi∣tayls necessary to his hoost. And the same cōmaundement to prouyde vitayls the captayn Calphurnius gaue to his trea∣sourer openly in cōmen audience: to thintēt that no man shuld suspect his false purpose: sayeng to his treasourer that hym neded nat to be in dout of Iugurth / for asmoch as trues were taken bytwene bothe parties tyll a certayn day prefixed. The treasourer Sextius went to the sayd cyte of Vacca at com∣maūdement of Calphurnius his captayne. Wherfore anone after Iugurth (lyke as he apoynted before) came to the army of Calphurnius / and there in presence of the rulers & counsell of the Romains / spake a lytell of his purgacion / concernyng the displeasure / enuy / & hatredde / whiche the senate and com∣mens of Rome had taken agaynst hym for his dedes: sayeng that he had nought done but prouoked of his ennemies / and for his owne defence: with violence to resyst violence. Howe beit he sayd that he was cōtented to yelde & submit hym selfe vnto the Romayns clemence and mercy. Somoch spoke he openly before all the chefe coūsell of the army. But all the re∣menaunt
he concluded and dyd secretly with Calphurnius & Scaurus at more leasoure / and thus ended ye cōmunicacion of this day. On the next day after insuynge the captayne and the counsell of the army / & also Iugurth assembled togyder agayn to common of the same mater concernyng peace to be graūted to Iugurth. Nowe was it so that at Rome was de∣creed an ordinaunce long before this tyme named among the romayns the Satyre lawe / whiche lawe cōmaunded that the captayne of euery army shulde aske aduyse of all the wyse counsell of his hoost whan he went about any weythy mater cōcernyng the cōmen wele. Wherfore Colphurnius thought so to order hymselfe that he shulde nat be counted a brecare of this lawe: And desyred counsell & aduise of all the noble and wyse men of his hoost. This dyd he to thyntēt that if the peace graūted to Iugurth shulde be afterward dysalowed at Ro∣me (as it was) he myght auoyde the faute from hymselfe into the cōmon coūsell. But at cōclusion / whan Calphurnius acor∣dyng to the sayd lawe had requyred aduyse of the common coūsell: euery man cōsented that peace shulde be graunted to Iugurth: vpon cōdicion & cōuenaunt that he shulde delyuer vnto the romayns thertie Elyphantes with moche other ca∣tell and many horses with a great somme of golde. To which ordinaunce Iugurth acorded and soone after delyuered the same Elyphantes / catell / and horses & golde vnto the tresou∣rer of the Romayne hoost. This done ye consull Calphurnius departed to Rome to requyre the senatours & other rulers to cōferme this peace & cōcorde which they had made with Iu∣gurth. In meane tyme ouer all Numydy and also in the Ro∣mayne army was peace and cōcorde in abydyng the answere of the senate and rulers at Rome. ¶Howe the rulers of Rome for the moost parte were greuously displeased for grauntyng of this-peace: and disalowed the same. And how Mem∣mius inflamed the cōmen people agaynst the fa∣uourers of Iugurth. ¶The .xviii. Chapter. BVt after it was knowen at Rhome in what maner the consull had behaued hymselfe in Affrike with Iugurth: in euery place about Ro∣me / and among euery company within Rome it was cōmyned of the dede of Calphurnius. In somoche that among the cōmenty was raysed greuous hate∣red & displeasure agaynst hym. The senators were sore trou∣bled
& were in doute whyther they myght cōferme and alowe this foule and shamefull dede of the consull / or els abrogate and annull the same. In this perplexite they were longe tyme vncertayne: And moost of all the myght and power of Scau¦rus (bycause he was a doer and felowe with the consull in the sayd dede) let them frome discussyng of the ryght. But whyle the senatours in suche wyse prolonged the tyme. In this du∣bitacion Memmius (of whose condicions / promptnes of wytte / and hatered: whiche he had agaynst the power of the estates and noble men we haue written before) at dyuers ty∣mes he assembled the cōmon people / exhortyng & inflamyng them to reuenge the cruelte of Iugurth / and parcialite of his fauourers / & warnyng them nat to forsake the defence of their cōmen wayle and libertie of theyr cite. He rehersed vnto them the pride / the cruelte / & manyfolde vnlawfull dedes of the se∣natours & of other estates at many tymes done to disworshyp and oppression of the cōmen wele. And vtterly at conclusion so he behaued hymselfe that he kyndled the myndes of the vni¦uersall cōmentie to resyst the parcialyte of the estates / and to se the cruelte of Iugurth extremely punysshed. But bycause the eloquence of this Memmius at that season was at Rome notable and moche set by / dyscrete & of great authorite: I ha∣ue intended of so many exhortacions as he had to the people: to cōmyt one to remembraunce by writynge: And specially be¦fore all other I wyll write that exhortacion which after retur∣nyng of Calphurnius from Affrike the sayd Mēmius spake before the cōmen people in fourme folowynge. ¶The orison of Memmius had before the com∣men people of Rome. In whiche orison he indu∣ceth them to defēde their lyberte: And to represse and persecute with hatered the noble men of Ro∣me. ¶The .xix. Chapter. RIght worthy cetyzins many thyng{is} shulde withdrawe me from defence of you and from charge & medlyng with your busynesses were nat the great loue & fauour which I haue to the commen wele: that causeth me to sette a syde all suche impedimentes / and vtterly to take vpon me the defence of your lyberte agaynst these corrupt estates. More playnly to ascertayne you: the thynges whiche myght with∣drawe me from defence of your cause be these. First the power of them which are begȳners of this variaūce: that is to say of
Calphurnius and Scaurus. Secondly your paciēce which is easy to be subdued of crueltie: sith ye be disposed to endure this wronge. And thyrdly the infeccion of Iustice whiche is no where here among vs / but clene eryled from oure cie. And principally this letteth me for that I se you so innocent / so fe∣ble mynded / and so symple that in euery place ye ar sure of all the peryll / of all the laboure / and of all the payne: but these estates whiche do nought that is cōmendable haue all the ho∣nour / auantage / and worshyppe. And sothely: it greueth me to speke to you of the iniury that now of late hath ben done to you: howe moche ye haue ben had in skorne / derision / and in dysdayne: to the power and pride of a fewe estates. And also it greueth to recount howe vnreuenged many of your defen∣ders by them haue shamefully ben put to deth for your sake within these fyftene yeres. And to se howe your myndes be corrupt with cowardyse and negligence that ye wolde neuer socoure them whiche in your quarell and defence haue sub∣dued themselfe to deth. What intende ye? wyll ye styl be sub∣gette vnto these estates your ennemyes. It is surely tyme at the last to aryse and defende your lybertie / ye do drede them: whome it semeth to dout and to drede you / consyderyng your true querell / and theyr vngoodly mysdemeanour. But nat withstandyng that ye be thus disposed to lose your libertie & in mysery to passe forthe ye resydue of your lyues / neuertheles the good wyll / whiche I haue to you and to the commen wele causeth and dryueth my mynde to resyst this fals fauoure and parcialyte of these proude and vniuste lordes. Certesse I shall assay and proue howe I can defende the libertie whiche my father left me: but whyther I shall so do to auauntage or elles in vayne that lyeth hole in your handes and power. Su¦rely worthy citezins I do nat exhort you to withstande these wronges and oppressions with force of armes as our forefa∣thers haue often done. To resyst and repell this wronge ne∣deth no violence no deuydynge of you from the senatours as your elders haue done before tyme. It must ned{is} be that these great men cōfederat in malyce at last shall come to decay by theyr owne condicions and insolent behauour. ¶Were nat sharpe inquisicions and greuous examinacions had agaynst the cōmen people of Rome / after that Tiberius Graccus was slayne for the defence of the lawes belongynge to the commentie: whome his euyl wylles accused as vsurper of kyngdome ouer the commen people. And moreouer after that Caius Graccus and Marcus Fuluius / were put to deth for defendyng of your lyberte / were nat many of your order and behauoure that is to say of the commentie put to deth
or murdred in prison: And at bothe the seasons the estates made none ende of theyr crueltie agaynst you after the lawe / but after theyr immoderate pleasure. Well forsothe I graunt that it be reputed for treason and vsurpacion of a kyngdome to defende the lawes and the ryght of the commentie: and I graunt also that what thyng can nat be cōdygnely punysshed without effusyon of blode of many citezins: that the same pu¦nisshement be executed accordynge to lawe and ryght vpon a fewe suche as were begynners of the trespasse. Within these fewe yeres passed ye dysdayned & murmured secretly among your selfe that the sayd lordes spoyled the commen treasoure without your consent: And that kynges and nacions contry∣butory to Rome / payed theyr trybutes to a fewe priuate esta∣tes / and nat generall to the vniuersall cite in commen: and ye grutched that these estates hadde all the most dignite and all the rychesse & treasoure / also in theyr handes. Neuerthelesse they coūted but a small thyng to escape vnpunysshed for these so great offences. Wherfore now are they become so bolde / so fiers / and proude: by your sufferance that at last they haue betrayed and put in handes of your ennemies / your lawes / your dignite / your mageste / withall other thynges bothe hu∣mayne and diuine to your libertie belongynge. So that in pardonyng of these inhumayne & cruell offences of Iugurth they haue polluted & betrayed the lawes bothe of god & man. And how beit that such is theyr demeanour it nothyng repen¦teth them: nor they be nought asshamedde therof. But dayly iette before your faces solemly and pompously bostyng them selfe: Some of theyr dignities / theyr lordshyppes / and offi∣ces. And other some crakyng of theyr triumphes and victo∣ries / as who sayeth that they attayned the same by honoure / and nat by falsehodde and robberie. Haue ye nat dayly expe∣rience seyng that symple bondmen bought & solde for money wyll nat suffre nor endure the vniust commaundementes of theyr lordes or maisters. But cōtrarywyse ye gentylmen: fre¦borne cetezyns ar contented to suffre with meke myndes this bondage wherin ye are holden subgette by the power of these lordes. But I pray you what maner of men be these whiche thus subdue you / and presume thus longe to occupy the com∣men wayle at this season? Forsothe they be men most vicious / with bloddy handes infected / with the blode of innocentes. Men of immoderate and insacable couetyse: noysom & gre∣uous to euery god man. Whose pride incredyble no man can comprehende / which for money haue solde and dayly are redy for to sell for lucre: theyr fidelite / theyr worshyppe / theyr deuo∣cyon / and good name: And brefely all thynges honest & disho∣nest
are they redy to do for auantage. Wherby it apereth eui∣dently that all theyr ioye & felicite resteth in couetyse. Some of them count themselfe more assured bycause they haue slay∣ne the protectours of the commentie to the intent that other may drede them so moche more: And other some of them in wrong examinacions & inquisions had agaynst you reioyse and count them selfe hardye & surer therby: And many other thynketh theyr defence and auauncement in murdring of you bostyng them selfe of the same: and thus howe moche wors that eche of them doth: the more sure he is & more sette by. In somoch that where they ought to fere you for theyr mysdedes: they transpose that feare vnto you / and cause you by your cowardyse to feare and drede them: whiche are conioyned all togyder agaynst you ī one maner desyre of yll / in one maner couetyse / in one hateredde of good / and in one maner fere of your auaūcemēt: but among good men to be all of one mynd vnder this maner one nat withstandynge an other it is to be counted for amyte and frendshyppe. Amonge yll men suche agreyng of maners is but a knotte of discorde and causeth sedycion / variaūce / and debate. But verily if ye had so great desyre and care to recouer your lyberte (which is lost) as they haue to encrease theyr lordshyppe: than shulde nat the cōmen¦wele be oppressed and wasted as it is nowe: and than shulde the offices / maistershyppes / and dignitees of Rome (whiche ar your benefites to gyue where lyketh you) be in the handes of good & vertuous men / and nat in the hādes of bold bosters and iniust men confederate in myschefe. The cōmentie of Ro¦me your forefathers before this tyme haue armed themselfe and forsaken the senators two sondry tymes & kepe themselfe togyder vpon the hyll of Aduentyne / onely bycause the wold haue a lawe decreed & inacted for them: And maisters or offi∣cers elect for them which shulde be theyr protectours agaynst the iniury and extorcion of the estates whan nede shulde re∣quyre / whiche thyng at last was graunted to them and many other lyberties also. Than shulde nat ye laboure moche more withall your myght for conseruacion of the same lyberties whiche they haue left vnto you as hole as euer they had them: And specially for this cause ought ye to defende your priuile∣ges for that it is more shame and rebuke to lese the priuilege and lybertie goten than neuer to haue optayned them: And specially what shame is it to you nothynge to augment nor encrease that authorite / whiche your elders & forefathers ha∣ue left to you: but to suffre ye same by your cowardyse by lytell and lytell to dekay: and at laste vtterly to be loste and come to nought? But any of you may than requyre of me what is yor
mynde / what wyll ye that we do? I wyll forsothe and coūsell that punysshment be taken vpon them whiche haue betrayed the honour of the commen wele vnto your ennemy Iugurth / without aduyse of the senators or of the cōmenty: but this my counsell is nat to punysshe them violently with your power in batayle / for certesse that were more dyshonoure vnto you to do than to them to suffre the same. Nat withstandynge that they be worthy so to be delt withall. But this thynge may be best done by inquysition / examinacion and cōfession of Iu∣gurth hymselfe / and by his accusacion of these treatours / whi∣che Iugurth surely wyll be obedient to come hyther to Rome at your cōmaūdemēt if it be true that he hath yelded hymselfe. But if he dyspice your commaundementes than may ye well thynke and cōsyder what peace or yeldynge he hath made by the which yeldyng he is vnpunysshed and pardoned of his de¦testable and shamefull dedes / and these estates laded with ri∣chesse and treasoure. But curcite and welthe of the cōmenty is come to losse / dammage / and vtter shame and disworshyp▪ Thus must ye do / suche examinacions must ye make with∣out ye thynke that these great men haue nat yet sufficiēt lord∣shyppe and power in theyr handes or els without ye shewe outwarde that ye were better pleased and content with that season whan kyngdomes / prouinces / iustices / lawes / iuge∣mentes / batayle / peace / and finally euery thyng bothe diuine and humayne were in handes of a fewe estates. Than ye be nowe pleased with the season & tyme that now is whan your lybertie is gyuen to you whiche ye are able to mayntayne if ye so be disposed. But in that season passed / howe beit ye were vnouercome of your ennemies / maisters / & emperours  ouer the most part of the worlde: yet had ye ynough to do to defen∣de your owne lyfe from the cruelty of these fewe mighty men. For of you all who was so bolde to withstāde their subieccion & bōdage. Wherfore if ye entend to endure & suffre the destru¦ction of your libertie as ye begyn thā truely ye tyme which is to come shalbe moch more cruell to you than the tyme passed. But as for me nat withstādyng that I vnderstand the great offence and abhominable of this wycked Iugurth is suffred vnpunysshed: yet wolde I suffre paciently that ye shulde for∣gyue & pardon the wicked doers of this dede men most vngra¦cious bycause they be citezins. If it were nat so / that such mer¦cy and forgyuenes shuld tourne to our dystruction & ruyne of our empire. For ye may se howe great oportunite and suffe∣rance they haue in somoche that they count but a small thyng to do vnhappely without punysshment. Wherfore they nowe dayly encrease theyr cruelty agaynst you / if ye do nat heraf∣ter
take from them the power & authorite therof. And specially cōtynuall busynes without ende shall remayne vnto you whā ye se playnly that outher ye must be seruaūtes or bondemen: or els ye must retaygne and defende your libertie by strength of your handes. For what hope or trust is there of faithfulnes or of concorde bytwene you and them▪ None surely. For their mynde is vtterly set to be lordes ouer you: and ye on the other part wyll nedes be fre and at liberte. They be extremely incli¦ned and disposed to do wrong and iniury vnto you. And ye la¦bour to withstande thē vtterly. And brefely to speke they take the frendes and felowes of our empire for ennemies. But our mortall ennemies they take for theyr felowes & frendes. But ye wolde withstande this cursed & vnkynde behauour. Wher∣fore can ye suppose that peace / loue / or frendshyppe can be among people so cōtrary of myndes & disposicion. For these cōsyderaciōs I warne & exhort you that ye suffre nat so great myschefe to escape vnpunysshed. This offence is nothynge lyke to the robbyng of the cōmon treasour / nor to ye spoylyng of money by extorcion frō the felowes & frend{is} of our empire. Which dedes (howbeit they be greuous & in maner intollera¦ble) neuertheles by custōe & vse of the same they ar reputed for small fautes & for nought. But this dede is moche more gre∣uous and vtterly intollerable. For the authorite of the senate is betrayed to our most cruell and fiers ennemy Iugurth / your empire is falsly betrayed to other mennes handes and possession. The cōmen wele hath ben put to sale to Iugurth by ye senators bothe at home in our cite / and also in our army by Calphurnius the cōsull: Insomoch that if examinacion be nat made herof: and if they be nat punysshed which be culpa∣ble & fautie herin. What thyng shall remayne vnto vs but that we must passe our lyfe vnder obedience and bondage of them which thus haue done / and vs shall they kepe in subiection as yf they were kynges? For what thynge longeth to a kynge / saue to parfourme his wyll and pleasur / be it good or yll with∣out any resystence or punysshment of any man. Do nat these estates thus wtout any cōtradiction / nat withstādyng that it is in your power to withstand thē if ye wyll. Nor certes wor∣thy citezins I do nat thus exhorte you to coueyt rather that your citezins shulde do yll than well. But I speke to thintēt / that ye shulde nat so fauour & forbere a fewe iniust & yll dispo∣sed men: that the vtter distruction of all good men shuld pro∣cede of suche indiscrete fauour: And also namely in a cite or a cōmen wayle it is moch better and more tollerable to forgete the rewarde of good dedes / than the punysshment of yll ded{is}. For a good man seynge his goodnes nat rewarded nor set by
he dothe but onely withdrawe his owne kyndnes: but an yll man nat punysshed / is the more bold & cursed: And moreouer if such as be mysdoers be punysshed / at the last theyr nombre shalbe abated & decresed / and if there be fewe vniust men / the lesse wrong is done. And he to whome no wronge is done ne∣deth nat to call for socour nor helpe. Thus it is better to leaue a good dede vnrewarded / than an yll dede vnpunysshed. ¶Howe Memmius induced the people of Ro∣me by the sayd orison: so that Cassius was sent for Iugurthe to brynge hym to Rome to declare and accuse the supporters of his dedes. ¶The .xx. chapyter. MEmmius coūsellyng & inducynge often tymes by these word{is} and other lyke at last dyde somoch that Lucius Cassius / one of the chefe .x. iudges of Rome shuld be sende to Iugurth & assure hym of his lyfe / and to come & retourne in saue garde vpon promes and fayth of all the hole cōmenty of Rome. And vpon this promes to bryng hym to Rome to thin¦ten that by his owne wordes and confession of the treuth / the falshode & couetyse of Calphurnius the consull / of Scaurus & of other whiche had ben corrupted by hym before by money and rewardes myght be euydently proued & knowen. ¶Of the behauour of the soudyours and other whiche were laft in Numidy whyle Scaurus the consull was at Rome. ¶The .xxi. chap. WHyle these thynges were in hand and done at Rome / in meane tyme the chefe of ye sou∣dyours / whiche Calphurnius had lefte behynd hym in Numidy folowed the maners and beha¦uour of theyr captayne & dyde many vngoodly and myscheuous dedes. Some of them were so corrupt with golde that they delyuerd agayne to Iugurth the olyphantes / which he had gyuen to Calphurnius what tyme ye peace was graunted and trues / first taken bytwene them. Some other solde to Iugurth the traytours whiche had fledde from hym vnto the romayns army: And other some spoyled & robbed the people of Numidy / whiche had all redy peace with the
Romayns / and had yelded themselfe. So great & shamefull was the violence of couetyse which had infected theyr mynd{is} as if it had ben an vniuersall contagion of pestence. But nowe wyll I returne to my mater where I left before concer∣nynge Cassius the iudge and his vyage to Numidy for to bryng Iugurth vnto Rome. ¶Howe Iugurth came to Rome with Cassius and howe he behaued hymselfe there. The .xxii. chapyter. CAyus Memmius in name of all the cōmens gaue cōmaundemēt to Cassius (accordynge to the ordinaunce inacted) to spede hym toward Numidy / and to bydde Iugurth come to Rome vnder suerte & cō∣dicion before rehersed. Whan the estates whiche knewe thēselfe culpable vnderstode of this they were maruelusly abassed. But wham Cassius was come to Iugurth / nat withstandyng that he was ereful of his part / and had no confidence in his cause for asmoche as he knewe hymselfe fauty in his owne conscience: yet Cassius aduysed hym and induced hym: bycause he had yelded hym∣selfe to come vnto Rome: without he wolde rather proue the Romayns strength and violence than theyr mercy and pyte: and moreouer the sayd Cassius promised also his owne fayth and trouth that if he wolde come to Rome and answere truly to all suche thynges as there shulde be demaunded of hym / he shulde safely go and come without any impediment. Cassius had so good a name at that tyme that Iugurth had asmoche cōfidence in his fayth & promes alone as in the promes or assu¦rance of the hole cite. And so at last Iugurth cōsented to go to Rome with Cassius. Wherfore to enduce the romayns to the more pyte he arayed hymselfe in rude aparell agaynst his ho∣nour royall moche vyle and myserable: and so with Cassius came to Rome nat as a kyng / but poorly and with a small cō∣pany. And nat withstandyng that his mynde was moche con¦fermed / assured / and bolded: by the confort of them whiche he had corrupted with rewardes before / vnder whose defence & supportacion he had cōmytted so moche cruelty: yet he beha∣ued hym so with his gyftes of newe assone as he was come to Rome / that by his great reward{is} be induced a lorde of Rome named Caius Bebius / one of the {pro}tectours of the cōmenty to be supporter & mayntener of his cause among the other mo▪
By whose dishonest & vnmesurable couetise he trusted assu∣redly to be defended / agaynst lawe / from all punysshmentes due vnto his demerites. But the cōmenty of Rome was vio∣lently and sore wrathe agaynst Iugurth / some cōmaunded to haue hym to prison & there to kepe hym in bandes: And other some wolde that acordyng to the lawe punysshment of dethe shulde by taken of hym as of theyr mortall ennemy / if he wold nat shortly cōfesse & discouer the felowes / partiners / & suppor∣ters of his cruell dedes. Caius Mēmius heryng herof called togyder the cōmenty and alayed the mocyon & wrath of theyr myndes apeasyng theyr vnauysed rancour. And requirynge them to kepe the fayth & trouth of the cite (which they had pro∣mysed to Iugurthe) clere / inuiolate / and vndefyled. Thus dyd Memmius exhort them as he which more regarded & set more by the conseruacion of the dignite of Rome / than by the parfourmynge and satisfyeng the wrath & ire of the rude cō∣mens. But whan sylence was made among all the assemble: anone Iugurth was brought forth before them all. Memmi{us} than began to speke to hym demurely rehersyng and openly recountyng how he had corrupt the estates of Rome with his treasure / and cruelly agaynst ryght had done many abhomy∣nable dedes at Rome / and also in Numidy agaynst the kyng Micipsa and his sonnes / as slayne Adherball and Hiempsall falsly dysceyued the kyng Micipsa: and wasted ye kyngdome of Numidy. And howebeit (sayd Memmius) that the Ro∣mayns knewe well his supporters yet they wold most of all that Iugurth shulde openly discouer & accuse them hymselfe. Wherfore he desyred hym truely to cōfesse the names of them by whose supportacion he was so bolde to cōmyt so many īmo¦derate & cruell dedes. Sayng that if he wold so do & cōfesse & disclose the trouth than myght he haue great trust and confy∣dence in ye fauour / clemēce / and mercy of the people of Rome. But if he wold nat so do / he shulde do no profet by his sylence to the noble men of Rome which had supported him: And also he shulde be dystruction and vndoyng of hymselfe / and of his ryches also. On this poynt Memmi{us} ceassed his wordes and helde hym styll. Anone Iugurth was cōmaūded of the com∣mente to make answere. But whan he was reddy to haue spo¦ken Caius Bebius whome he had corrupted with treasour (as I haue made mencion before) commaūded hym to hold his pease. In somoche that howebeit the people sore moued with displeasure put hym in feare with exclamacion agaynst hym with angry countenances▪ and often violently rennynge vpon hym / and with other tokens of yre and dyspleasure. Neuerthelesse for all this the frowarde counsell of Bebius
ouercame theyr thretnyng / insomoche that Iugurth wolde nothyng speke nor dysclose. And thus the people had in deri∣sion & abused / departed from the cōgregacion and assemble. So the myndes of Iugurthe / of Calphurnius / and of other theyr partyners were than inhansed & increased in boldnesse: whiche were troubled and moche ferefull before / whan Iu∣gurth was first sende for and brought to be examined. ¶How Iugurth encreased his crueltie at Rome and renued his murdre in sleayng an other noble man of the stocke of Micipsa by occasion wherof he was constrayned to departe from Rome / and the batayle renewed agayne of hole. ¶The .xxiii. chapyter. AT the same season was a gentle∣man at Rome named Massiua / borne of the countrey of Numidy / whiche was the son̄e of Galussa / & neuewe to ye good kyng Massinissa. This Massiua was agaynst Iugurth in the stryfe & discēcion bytwene Adherball & hym / whan the towne of Cir∣tha was yelded and Adherball slayne. Whefore he trusted nat Iugurth / but to saue hymselfe fled from Numidy vnto Ro∣me. Nowe was a lorde at Rome named Albinus / whiche was creat consull with an other partyng felowe named Mi∣nucius / the next yere after Calphurnius. This Albinus came to Massiua and coūsayled hym (bycause he was of the stocke of Massinissa) to greue Iugurth / asmoch as he coude / with enuy / feare / and displeasure for his offences & cruelte: And by peticion to desyre of the senatours the administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy. Albinus gaue to hym this counsell / for asmoch as he hymselfe was desyrous of batayle. Wherfore he wold moch rather that euery thyng wer moued with trou¦ble / than pacified or at rest. Than was a custome at Rome / that the consull shulde haue a partyng felow / & bytwene them the prouinces belongyng to Rome shulde be deuided. Thus in departyng of the prouinces / the coūtrey of Numidy fell to Albinus / and the countrey of Macidony to his felowe Mi∣nutius. Shortly after Massiua began to moue the mater to the senatours touchyng administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy. Iugurth hering of this had nat so great trust ī his mater nor to his frendes as he had before: For some of them with drewe theyr selfe for knowlege of theyr fautes / and other
some for feare of yll name and fame or rumour of the people. Wherfore Iugurth consyderyng this requyred Bomilchar / one of his most nere & trusty frendes to prouyde and to hyer by gyftes & rewardes a cōpany to sle the sayd Massiua / and that as priuely as coude be done. But if it coud nat priuely be done than to slee hym openly by one meane or other Bomil∣char shortly went about the cōmaundement of Iugurth / and anone prouided men & hyed suche as were mete for suche a dede: and cōmaunded them to espy and serche his wayes / his goynges & cōmyng{is} / and to wayet a season & place cōuenient to parforme theyr enterprise. But afterwarde whan he sawe his tyme he prepared to execute this treason. Wherfore one of them which were ordayned & assigned to this murdre / assay∣led Massiua rasshely / with small prouisyon or auysement / & slewe hym vnware. But he whiche dyde the dede anone was taken & brought before the iudges. The people in great nom∣bre desyred & at last cōstrayned hym to tell by whose coūsell he dyd that myscheuous dede / and specially Albinus the consull coarted hym therto. The murderer anone cōfessed the treuthe and declared howe he had done it at the instigacion & counsel of Bomilchar: And nat withstādyng that the same Bomil∣char came to Rome / vnder the sauegarde & assurance of the fayth of the commente as dyd Iugurth / yet he was iudged gyltie of the dede / cōsideryng that he was coūselloure therto / and nat accordyng to the common lawe / but after very equite and good cōscience. But Iugurth cōsyderyng hymselfe cul∣pable in the same faute / yet wolde by no meane confesse nor knowlege hymselfe fautie / tyll tyme that he vnderstode and sawe that the enuy and displeasure which was taken agaynst this dede passed all his fauoure and rewardes whiche he had gyuen at Rome / so yt at last in his gyftes he foūde no socoures nor ayde. But howebeit in the first accion or accusemēt which was layed agaynst hym / he had brought in & layd .l. suerties of his frendes for hym & all other of his retynue that he shuld purge hymselfe of euery thyng which was or shulde be layed agaynst hym / yet thought he better to prouide for the protec∣cion of his kyngdome than for the helth of his pledges or suerties. And this cōsydring he priuely sent Bomilchar away from Rome vnto Numidy / dredynge that if condyng and worthy punysshement were taken of Bomylchar at Rome / let the other commentie of his realme at home wolde drede to be obedient to hym. And anone after Bomilchar was de∣parted Iugurth hymselfe fledde also from Rome after hym commaunded of the senatours to depart from Italy as enne∣my to the romayns & theyr empyre. But whan he was depar∣ted
a lytell without Rome: it is sayde that he loked often backewarde behynde hym spekyng secretly to hymselfe / but at the last he spake playnly in audience that they whiche were assystent myght here hym and sayd. O noble and famous ci∣tie corrupt and accloyed with infect citezins / whose couetyse is so insaciable that they wyll profer the forth to sale / & shortly thou shuldest be solde and perysshe / if thy rulers coude fynde any man that wolde bye the / and gyue money for the. ¶Howe Albynus consull of Rome renewed the warre agayng Iugurthe / and at last returned a∣gayne to Rome leauynge his brother Aulus in Numidy / with the army in his rowme. The .xxiiii. chapyter. IN the mean season Albinus whi∣che was create consull next after Calphur∣nius renewed the warre agaynst Iugurth and wtout taryeng causeth vytayls / wag{is} and all other thynges necessary / expediēt / and belongynge to soudyours: to be con∣ueyed spedely into Affrike. And he anone hymselfe in all hast toke his vyage thyderwarde also / and so forth to Numidy. In which vyage he made more hasty expe∣dicion to thintent to fynisshe the warre with Iugurth / other by force of armes / or els cōstrayning hym to yeld hymselfe / or by some other meanes what so euer myght be founde namely before the tyme of election of newe consuls / whiche tyme was nat longe to come. But contrary wyse Iugurth prolonged euery thyng by one cause or other. As fast as Albinus went forwarde / so fast Iugurth founde impedimentes / somtyme he promysed to yelde hymselfe / and somtyme fayned hymselfe afrayed. One whyle he fled from the army of Albinus whan it was nere hande to hym: And anone after lest his men shuld mystrust by dysconfort or dispayre / he boldely withstode and defended hymselfe manly. And thus in prolongyng the tyme: somtyme with warre and somtyme with peace / he abused and mocked the consull / wherfore some were which suspected that Albinus was nat ignorant of the counsell of Iugurth / but cō∣sentyng to hym by fauoure: And for asmoche as at the begyn∣nynge he was so fiers / hasty / and diligent: it was suspected that he droue forth the tyme nowe rather by craft than cowar∣dyse. But after the tyme was passed and the day of election of newe consules aproched & came fast on. The consull Albinus
ordayned his brother named Aulus / to remayne in his stede as captayne and ruler in the army: and he hymselfe departed towarde Rome / to be at election of the newe consuls / as the lawe requyred. ¶How Aulus and the romayne army were dis∣confyted of Iugurth: and howe peace was graū¦ted to hym by Aulus: and to what shame the Ro¦mayns were put by rasshe foly of the same ca∣pytayne Aulus. ¶The .xxv. chapyter. IN the same season was the com∣men wayle at Rome moche troubled with variaunce and debate / betwene the prote∣ctours of the commentie. For of them one named Lucullus and an other Annius la∣boured to contynue and kepe styll their offi¦ce and agaynst the ordynaunce of the lawe to contynue more than one yere. Wherfore the other whiche were {per}tyngfelowes ī office with them laboured with all their myght the contrary to resyst them and to mayntayne the olde constitucion / ordynaunce and custome. This dyscencion and debate letted the election of the newe consuls all that yere. Au∣lus whom Albinus had left with the army in Numidy as his lewtenant herd of this prolongyng of the tyme & was brought in great hope to wynne great honour or treasour. Wherfore in the cold moneth of Ianuary he called the soudyours forth of theyr tentes to execute the batayle with Iugurth without more delay. Outher dyde he thus shortly to make an ende of the batayle in his tyme / and therby to wynne honoure or els with his army to put Iugurth in feare (so that to haue peace) he shulde redeme the same of Aulus with great treasoure. Aulus concludynge on this purpose / spedde hym so fast with his soudyours makyng dayly great iournayes (nat withstā∣dyng the sharpnesse of wynter) that at last he came to a towne in Numidy / named Suthull: in whiche towne the treasours of Iugurth were layed. This towne with walles / waters / and moūtaygnes of nature was strongly defended: for with∣out the walles buylded on the heyght of a mountaygne bro∣ken on the forefronte was a great playne fenne / or marrayse grounde: all ouercouered with mudde / and standyng wynter water. Insomoche that what for the sharpnesse of the wynter season: and what for naturall defence of the place / this towne coude by no meanes bewell besyged nor taken: yet this nat wt∣standyng
Aulus to encrease fere to Iugurth / and for the blyn∣de desyre which he had to wynne the towne in maner of dissi∣mulacion assayled the same and made pauayses about the walles of sheldes conioyned lyke vynes / wherunder his men myght fyght with lesse dammage or paryll. Than made he a dyche or trenche rounde about the towne with great hepes of erth casten vpon the sydes of the same / to the entent that no socours shulde entre into them / nor they escape forth at theyr pleasurs. And finally he made redy euery thynge whiche be∣longed or was necessary to besegyng of suche a towne. But Iugurth anone perceyued the vayne and folysshe behauoure of Aulus / and craftely encreased by polycy the madnes of hym / sending often embassadours vnto hym to requyre in de∣rysion that he wolde desyst and leue besyginge of the towne / and intreatyng hym of peace mekely. But in the meane tyme Iugurth hymselfe in maner as yf he wold nat intermell with Aulus / ledde his army by wodes / forestes / by streat passages / by hyls & dales / and by bacways: causynge Aulus to suspect that he was a dradde of hym: And finally he enduced Aulus to truste after some apointement. And thus Iugurth with his men fleyng alway into desertes and hydde places gaue confort to Aulus and encreased his corage by such auoyding. Insomoch that at last Aulus gaue vp the segyng of the tow∣ne of Suthull: And with his hole power hastely pursued Iu¦gurth as fleynge from hym for drede into places vnknowen to hym and his men. Thus was the treason of Iugurth more hydde from Aulus / wherfore he made the lesse prouision ther∣fore. In the meane season Iugurth by subtyll messangers attempted the romayne army day and nyght inducyng them to consent to betray theyr felowes / the capytayns / and vnder∣captayns: anone for lucre consented to hym. Some in tyme of batayle to forsake and betray theyr owne company and to fyght on the part of Iugurth. And other whiche wolde nat graūt to so foule a dede / as to fyght agaynst theyr owne com∣pany / he exhorted and induced them whan the trumpettes shulde blowe to batayle to leue theyr places & array: And de∣part from theyr company without stroke on one syde or other. Whan euery thynge was brought to his purpose and accor∣ded to his requestes: Than about mydnyght he stale priuely towarde the tentes of the romayns: and sodenly with a great company of Numidyans / compassed them about on euery syde and assayled them fiersly. The romayne soudyours whiche were with Aulus / thus vnwarly inuaded: were mer∣uelously abasshed and amased / for ye vnwont & sodayn feare of this treason. Some of the most noble hertes: with great
courage drewe to them theyr harnes / and resysted theyr enne∣mies valyantly: fully assured and prefyxed to dye lyke men: yf fortune shulde graunt them none other meanes to escape that instant danger. Some other as cowardes hydde them∣selfe in caues & other secrete places / yf they myght any fynde. The boldest and most vsed to suche chaunces conforted theyr felowes whiche were ferefull and vnexpert of suche chaunces of warre. Howbeit none of them all was so bolde nor so well assured of hymselfe / but that he was bothe in great drede and danger. And no maruayle / for in euery place and on all sydes about them they were inuironed in compasse with great vio∣lence & plentious nombre of theyr ennemies hyd vnder dark∣nes of the nyght and cloudes which vtterly obscured the ster∣res lyght. Theyr paryll was indiferēt and doutfull whyther they fled or abode the batayle. For deth was instant and de∣pended ouer theyr hedes euery way: and other hope nor espe∣raūce was none / saue deth ineuitable. So that finally it was vncertayne vnto them whether it was better ormore sure to fle or to abyde to theyr auēture. But of that company wihich Iugurth had corrupted with rewardes as we haue sayd be∣fore one bende or cohort of lombardes and tow turmes that is to say .lx. thraciens and a fewe rude and cōmen soudyours betrayed the romayns and went ouer to Iugurth. Also the Centurion whiche was assigned to be captayne ouer them / whiche were cōmytted to fyght about the first standard of the thyrd legion drewe hym and his company asyde and suffred theyr ennemies to entre into the myddes of the hoost on that syde which they had taken to defend. Thus all ye Numidyēs brake in on that syde without any resystence. And at conclu∣sion the romayns had a foule flyght and a shamefull discon∣fiture / insomoche that they trusted more to theyr fete than to theyr handes or armour: And many of them to ren lyghter / thrue away theyr armour and harnes / and toke the top of an hyll whiche was nere therby and ther taryed. The company of Iugurth / what for spoylinge of the romayns tentes and darknes of the nyght had les honour of victorie and suffred many of the romayns to escape. On the next day after Iu∣gurth and Aulus came to cōmunication togyder. Than sayd Iugurth to Aulus that nat withstandyng that he had hym & his army which were letf alyue sure ynough cōpassed and en∣uyroned with wepen & hunger so that they coude nat escape hym: and howebeit it was in his power to oppres hym & all his. Neuertheles he remembred well ynough the incertayn chances of mannes busynesse & wold nat be to hym cruell nor vncurres so that he wolde make wt hym a bonde of peas and
no more contend agaynst hym in batayle / on this condicion / that all the soudyours of Aulus shulde do obesance vnto hym and passe vnder a spere in token of subiectyon and so without more damage depart out of the countrey of Numidy within the space of .x. dayes next after. But howbeit this composi∣cion and condicions were hard / greuous / and full of shame & misery: and worthy to be punysshed of the senatours yf Au∣lus agreed to them. Neuerthelesse theyr myndes so wauered for drede of deth that at last the composicion & agrement was concluded & agreed at the wyll & pleasure of Iugurth vpon the sayd condicions. ¶what sorowe and heuynes was at Rome: and how they demeaned themselfe in the cite after that tydynges herof were brought thyder. ¶The .xxvi. chapyter. WHan the Romayns vnderstode of this at Rome / all the cite was fylled with drede / so∣rowe / lamētacion & mournyng. Some beway∣led the worshyp of tempire as lost by that sha∣mefull cōposicion: And other vncustomed to su∣che busynesse of batayle: & nat knowyng nor cōsydryng the variable mutabilite of chaūces of wary fered the losse of their libertie / of their cite / and of all theyr empire. They all were wrothe & vtterly displeased wt Aulus cause of this subiection & shamefull cōposicion. But namely they which had ben good warryours in their dayes were displeased with hym most of all: whan they cōsydred that he beyng armed & well apointed to batayle rather sought meanes to escape from deth by suche shamefull & bonde cōposicion than manly abyding the exre∣mite of batayle to haue delyuered hymselfe & his cōpany: or els valyantly to haue dyed with honoure. But the cōsull Al∣binus / hymselfe dreded sore for this thyng{is} cōsydring that for his brothers faute in tyme to cōe he shuld nat auoyde the dis∣pleasure of the senatours & cōmens of Rome. For as he conie¦ctured all his brothers dedes shuld redoūde to his dishonour & paryll / bycause he had lymitted hym in Numidy in his sted to be captayne of the army in his absēce. Wherfore (these thyn¦ges duely aduysed) he went to the senators desyringe them to take counsell & aduisemēt whyther they wolde approbate and allowe the sayd cōposicion bytwene his brother Aulus & Iu∣gurth: or els nat. But he knewe ryght well that the senatours wolde nat cōferme the same. Wherfore (in meane tyme whyle they wer coūselling) he elect soudyors for supplimēt to fulffyll
and parforme agayne the army whiche was in Affrike / and sore diminisshed. For many of them were slayne by Iugurth and his company. Wherfore Albinus raysed vp socours of such as were nere to the costes of Rome / and frendes to them∣pire: as Latinians and Italians with other naciōs. Of these he raysed as many as he myght / and assembled them togyder by all meanes whiche he coude deuyse to fournysshe and aug∣mente his army. At conclusion the senatours decreed in their counsell that no bonde of peace nor composicion myght be cō∣firmed without their consent and without the aduyse & com∣maundement of the cōmen people also: as ryght and reason requyred. And thus was the sayd cōposicion of Aulus abro∣gate / as thyng presumed without consent or cōmaundement of the senatours or commens. But whan the consull Albinus had ordayned and prepared supplement of his army (as sayd is) he was prohybet and letted by the protectours of the cō∣menty: Insomoche that he was nat suffred by them to conuey suche company as he had raysed into Affrike / with hym as he intended to repayre and tornysshe the army whiche there re∣mayned. Wherfore he spedde hymselfe forth into Affrike disa∣poynted of his purpose with a small company of men / of his owne retynue. The army of the romayns whiche he before had cōmytted to Aulus his brother: accordyng to the opoynt∣ment with Iugurth / was departed forth of Numidy. And to pasforth the wynter / taryed in a prouince of Affrike whiche was subget to thempire of Rome. Whan Albinus the consull was arryued & come thyder: his mynde ardently was kynd∣led with desyre to pursue: Iugurth / and to remedy the yl wyl and displeasure whiche the commens at Rome had agaynst Aulus his brother. Neuertheles whan he knewe the maners and yll behauour of the soudyours: of whome some were fled treyterously to Iugurth (as is sayd before) & some by suffe∣raunce of theyr captayne were infected and corrupted with ouermoch pleasure / dissolute liberty / and voluptuous lyuing: this consydring he concluded (as the case requyred) to do no∣thyng for a season: and to attempte no maistry: but to passe forth the wynter with his army without remouynge or put∣tyng hymselfe in ieopardy or paryll. ¶In the meane season whyle Albinus and his army soiour∣ned in the {pro}uince of Affrike tyll the wynter were ouerpassed. At Rome was one named Caius Manlius elect and lymit∣ted proiectour of the cōmen people whiche anone after he was se in authorite: assembled the cōmens: & desyred & coūsayled them that inquisicion myght be made of all such by whose sup¦portacion & coūsell Iugurth had dyspised & set a nought the
ordinaūces decreed of the senatours. And agaynst them whi∣che had restored agayne to Iugurth the elyphantes whiche Iugurth had delyuerd to Calphurnius at the first composi∣cion and apoyntment whiche was made with hym. And also agaynst them whiche had receyued any money or other re∣ward{is} of Iugurth whyle they were embassadors or captains of armies ayenst hym: send forth by the romayns. And final∣ly the same inquisicion also was extended agaynst all such as had made any pactions / apoyntmentes / or promises of peace or of warre with ennemies of thempire without generall cō∣sent of the senatours or commens. ¶Whan this inquire was moued: many of the senatours & noble men of Rome knewe themselfe culpable in the forsayd articles. And other some douted sore of paryls for to come by∣cause of the ylwyll & malyce whiche the partie of the cōmens confederat had agaynst them. Wherfore syth the same noble men myght nat well resyst the examinacion of these articles openly: but of necessite they must agre therto: other els know∣lege themselfe (by their resystence) gylte in the same: therfore they prepared impedimēt priuely agaynst suche inquisicions by theyr frend{is}: but specially by ye felowes of thempire whiche were cōfederate with the romayns / as Italyans & Latiniās. The princes of these nacions & suche other lyke gaue counsell to the senatours whiche were nat fauty in the premysses / and also to the cōmenty: that in suche a troublous / besy / and peryl∣lous season no suche examinacions shulde be made nor proce∣de forwarde to effect: for drede of many inconueniences which of the same myght ryse bytwene the noble men & the cōmens. But (this nat withstandyng) it is a merueylous thyng and in maner incredible to speke of: how besy and diligent the com∣mens were to haue the same inquisicion to procede / and to be brought to effect: and that rather for hatered whiche they had agaynst the noble men (agaynst whome the sayd inquisicion was ordayned) thā for any good wyll or fauour / whiche they had to the cōmen wele. So great pleasure & desyre of variāce was among them. Wherfore whyle the remenant of the noble men were sore troubled with fere and drede. Marcus Scau∣rus which was before sent into Affrike with Calphurni{us} (as I haue sayd) prouided for hymselfe in crafty maner as I shall nowe declare. Whyle the cōmenty was mery & ioyeous of this examinacion & many of the company of Scaurus that knew themselfe fauty fled for feare. And the hole cite was in moche drede and Manlius obtayned his peticion & wyll of the com∣menty. In somoche that anone were ordayned thre noble men cōmissioners to examine the thre articles before rehersed and
here insuyng of whom the first was of them which counselled Iugurth to dispise the decreis of the senatours and that toke money or rewardes of hym. The seconde was of them that solde agayn to Iugurth the forsayd elyphantes and the Nu∣midiens that left Iugurth commynge on the romayns syde. And the thyrde examinacion was of them whiche had made any apointement of peace or warre with the ennemies of Ro∣me as was Iugurth. But nat withstandynge that Calphur∣nius was culpable in the same asmoche as any other of the no¦ble men. Neuerthelesse he shyfted so for hymselfe that he was electe to be one of the examinours or commyssioners to make inquisicion of these thre poyntes rehersed. The inquisicion proceded to effecte and was handled and put in execucion with moche violence and sharpely after the commen ru∣mour and pleasure of the cōmenty. Thus the people seynge theyr pleasure fulfylled / at that tyme began to be proude and statly therof in lykewyse as the estates had ben in foretyme of theyr power and lordshyp. But here wyll I make a small dy∣gression fro my purpose & tell wherof this variance & discord bytwene the cōmens and noble men first proceded. ¶wherof the dyscorde and takyng of parties by¦twene the noble men and cōmens of Rome / had fyrst begynnyng. ¶The .xxvii. chapyter. THis maner of deuisyon of the com¦mente from the estates of Rome: This dis∣corde & takyng of parties bytwene them: & this inordinate custom of all other incōue∣nyences / began among thē but a fewe ye∣res before this tyme by meane of ouer mo∣che rest ad ydlenes: by superfluous habun∣dance of richesse / voluptuosite / and of other worldely delecta∣cions: whiche many counte & repute for most chiefe pleasures of this lyfe. For before the dystruction of Carthage / the sena∣tours and cōmenty of Rome treated and gouerned the cōmen¦wele bytwene them peasably in loue and concorde. So that among the citezins was no stryfe nor debate / for laude / excel∣lence / for dignite / nor for great dominion. The drede whiche they had of their ennemis made them warre and kept them in good maners causyng them to gouerne their cite with good & vertues institutes / without variance / without robbery / with∣out oppression / without slaughter nor other lyke cruell tyran¦nies. But whan Carthage was ouercome anone was expul∣sed
fere from theyr myndes: and voluptuosite / wantonnes / & pride (which ar greatly loued in welth and prosperite) anone entred their myndes: so that they desyred peace whā they had warre. But whā the warre was ended: & that they had peace and ydlenes after theyr owne desyre: theyr peace and rest was more sharpe / more bytter / more intollerable / and more peril∣lous to them thā the warre was before. For the estates began to tourne theyr dignite & worshyp / into immoderate affection of great lordshyppe and dominacion. And the cōmen people began to tourne theyr libertie into lust and pleasure. Euery man prouyded and drewe to hymselfe robbynge & reauynge without measure / from the cōmen wele. Thus was the com∣mentie abstract & deuyded from the lordes. So was the cite deuyded into two partes. And the cōmen wele which was in ye myddes bytwene thē on euery syde was pylled / robbed / & vtterly wasted of them both: on both sydes. But the power of the noble men and of theyr party was more myghty than the power of ye cōmens. For all the estates were all togyder assem¦bled / conioyned / & vnyed. But the cōmens were dispersed and spredde abrode into dyuerse places and companyes gettynge theyr lyueng with labour of theyr handes & swet of theyr bo∣dyes. So euerythyng was gouerned in peace and in warre at pleasure & aduyse of a fewe priuate noble men. The cōmen treasoure / the prouynces / maistershyppes / offices / tributes / worshyppe / tryumphes / and all other thynges longyng to ho∣nour or auātage were onely in hand{is} & possession of the same fewe noble men. But the simple cōmen people was weryed & oppressed with pouerty / with batayle / and warfare. Euer in ieopardy / and neuer in auantage nor lucre. For the captayns with a fewe other noble men pulled suche prayes as were ta∣ken in batayle onely to theyr singuler auantage and behofe. But in the meane season the parentes & small chyldren of the soudyors were dryuen from their dwellyng places & possessi∣ons by the sayd noble men: echone of them by that lorde vnto whom they dwelled nerest. And so the myght & power of such noble men cōioyned with immoderate couetyse assayled / defy¦led / wasted / and dystroyed euery thyng without good maner without measure or moderacion: hauyng no respect nor cōsy∣deracion of any thyng belongyng to goodnes or vertue: tyll they had so farforth proceded that at conclusion they were dy∣stroyed & ouerthrowen by theyr owne obstinate pride & tyran∣ny. But at last assone as euersome of the estates were foūde whiche remembryng and consydryng themselfe: set more by true and laudable glory / than by iniust power and dignite. And were moued in myndes by compassion to shewe mercy &
pyte agaynst the cōmente and to socour their misery than be∣gan the cite to be troubled and moued greuously for the cou∣rage of the cōmens was reuyued by supportacion of such no∣ble men: by meanes wherof discorde and deuysion began to ryse in the cite / as it were drye dust of the grounde raysed in a great & tempestyous wynde. For after that Tiberius Grac∣chus / & Caius Gracchus (whose progenitours moch encrea∣sed the cōmen wayle in many batayls / but namely in the ba∣tayle of Carthage) began to restore the commētie into theyr olde libertie / and to detect the cruell mysdedes of the fewe in∣iurious estates. Than all the lordes cōfederate: and after ma¦ner chafed with yre assembled theyr felowes / as Latynians and some knyghtes of Rome / which in hope of {pro}mocion left the cōmens party and helde with the noble men. All these with suche as were to them lenyng of other nacions began to with∣stande the accusemētes of both the sayd Gaccus / whiche were fauourers of the cōmenty: & first of all they slewe Tiberius Graccus. And after that within a fewe yeres they slewe the other brother named Caius Graccus / whyle he was {pro}tectour of the cōmenty: bycause that he acordyng to lawe & right deui¦ded among the poore cōmente such land{is} as they had won in batayle of theyr ennemies. And at the same season the estates put to deth also a lorde named Marcus Faccus / bycause he defended the cōmens liberte agaynst theyr extorcion. But tou¦chyng the two brethern Tiberius / and Caius Graccus: soth∣ly their myndes were greatly immoderate and vnmesurable in theyr desyre to ouercome the states. Neuerthelesse it had be moche better to the states to haue suffred them in theyr ryght∣wyse tytell / & somwhat to haue inclyned to theyr myndes than to haue ouercome them so violently and slayne them so iniu∣ryously / how beit that they were ouer hasty & besy. But whan the states had the victory of them after their desyre & pleasure than put they to deth the cōmenty without nombre / and ma∣ny they exiled & droue out of the cite. In somoch that frō thens forth they rather encreased theyr crueltie and feare to the com∣mens / than their owne honoure or power. By which meanes many worthy citees haue often tymes ben dystroyed whyle the estates and commens contende the one / to ouercome the other / by one meane or other. And whyle the party vyctoure wyll punysshe ouer greuously that party which is ouercome. But yf I wold prepare to write of the besynesse and dedes of both the parties seriatly & dystincly. And yf I shulde touche all the maners of the cite acordyng to the gretnesse of the ma∣ter and as it requyreth: othely the tyme shuld fayle me rather than the mater. Wherfore I wyll omyt this superfluous and
infenite besynes / and retourne to my first mater and purpose touchyng this cronycle of this tyranne Iugurth. ¶Howe Metellus was creat consull and sende by the Romayns to warre agaynste Iugurthe: & of the wyse and dyscrete behauour of the same Metellus. ¶The .xxviii. chapyter. AFter the truse and composicion of Aulus before sayde made with Iugurth / & the foule & shamkfull flyght of the romayne army: Quintus Metellus / and Marcus Sillanus / were creat & proclamed consuls of Rome / whiche acordyng to the olde cu∣stome parted & deuyded the prouynces be∣longyng to Rome bytwene them bothe. The countrey of Nu¦midy fell and happened to Metellus. This Metellus was a fierse man and a noble & a worthy warryour. And howbeit he fauoured the party of the noble men and was cōtrary to the party of the cōmens: neuertheles he was of fame vndefyled & vnuiolat / and coūted of good name indifferētly on both par∣ties. Assone as euer this Metellus entred in his office & di∣gnite / he thought that euery thyng apartayning to his rowm & charge belōged aswell to his partyng felowe as to hymselfe / saue the warre of Numidy: whiche onely belonged to hym∣selfe & to his {per}ticuler charge: Wherfore he cōmytted all other charges to Sillanus / and onely sette his mynd to make pro∣uysion for ye warre agaynst Iugurth. But bycause he mistru¦sted the olde army whiche was in Numidy with Albinus & Aulus / and had no cōfydence in the myndes of these soudyors corrupted with ydelnes & many other vices: therfore he ele∣cted and assembled newe soudyours. And of all suche as were felowes & frendes confederate to the Romayns / he called for helpe & socours. He prepared & made redy armoure / wepyn / horse harnes / and all other ordynaunce expediēt to warfare. And also he ordayned abundaūce of vytayls. And shortly to speke all thyng{is} he ordayned which ar wont to be necessary & profitable to the variable chaunces & incertayne accidentes / and ieopardies of warre / which requyreth reparacion of ma∣ny thynges & chargeable. But suche as were felowes of the empire of Rome at instaūce & request of the senatours: and by theyr authorite and by the Latinians & many other stran∣ge kynges of theyr owne frewyll sent socours to Metellus to auaunce hym in his enterpryse: And shortly to speke the hole
cytie laboured withall theyr myght to socoure and ayde Me∣tellus in his besynesse. Thus at last whan euery thynge was prouyded and sette in order after his pleasure & intent: than toke he his iournay into Numidy / with great hope of all the cytezins of Rome that for his good maners: and specially for that his mynde was vnouercōe with rychesse or coueryse that he shuld do more honoure to the empire than his predecessors had in the warre of Numidy. For before his departynge the welth of Numidy (by coueryse of the officers of Rome) was augmēted: but the welth of the Romayns wasted and demi∣nisshed. Whan Metellus was come to Affrike / the army was delyuered vnto hym by Albinus: which army was vncrafty / sluggysshe / & feble nouther able to endure paryll nor labour / of tunge more redy / fiers / and hardy than of hande: whiche was wont to robbe / and pyll from felowes and frendes of the empire. But it selfe endured by cowardise to be robbed and spoyled of ennemies of the empyre / as a lawlesse & dysordred cōpany of men vngouerned & without authorite or maners. Wherfore Metellus the newe capytayne hadde moche more thought & besynesse / for suche corrupt & vicious maners of a company so farre out of order / than he hadde helpe or good hope of confort in the multitude of them. Thus howe beit he sawe the tyme of election of newe cōsuls drawe nere. And all yf he also vnderstode that the Romayns dayly loked after some ende of the warre. These causes nat withstandyng yet he cōcluded / nat to begyn the warre tyll he had excercysed and vsed the soudyors with besynesse & labour aft the instruction and custome of olde captayns / vsed before his tyme. For why Albinus was so astonyed with the aduersite & myschaunce of his brother Aulus and for murdre of his hoost: that after he purposed nat to depart out of the romayns prouince whiche was in Affrike / he kept the soudyors alway ydell in theyr ten∣tes as longe as the somer season lasted & as long as he was in authorite in somoche that they chaunged no place except the corrupt sauoure of the place / or els necessite of vitayle cōstray¦ned them to remoue. Nor accordyng to the custome & maner of warryours amonge them was no watche: but euery man came & went at his owne pleasure / and absented thēselfe from theyr standardes whan it lyked them. The scolyons & pages wandred day & nyght mengled among the horsemen & chiefe of the soudyours without any order: And many other as ro∣uers dyspersed abrode destroyed the countrey / fyghtynge agaynst the small villages / & nat agaynst citees nor townes. They caryed away from the sayd villages prayes of catell: and the inhabitātes ledde away also with them as prisoners
with other prayes stryuyng togyder who myght haue most / and than after chaunged the sayde roberies with marchaun∣tes for delycious & strong wynes caryed from other strange countreis / where better wyne grewe than in that coūtrey: and for other suche delycious thyng{is}. They solde away the where and other vitayles which was delyuered of theyr capytayns among them in cōmen & dayly they bought theyr bread. And finally what euer shame or rebuke longyng to couetyse or le∣chery: coude outher be sayd / done / or ymagined of any man: all was vsed in that hoost. And among some: more shamefull dedes than ought to be named. But Metellus hehaued hym selfe as a myghty & wyse man / nat lesse this difficultie & hard¦nesse / than if it had ben in a batayle foughtē agaynst his ennē¦mies as he which in myddes of so great couetyse / voluptue∣site / & cruelty was syngulerly indued with tēperaunce: & mer∣ueylous good maner vsed he / in coartynge the same fautes. Wherfore at the first begynnynge he withdrewe & auoyded from the army at his commaundemēt & ordinaunce: the occa∣syons which styred the soudyours to suche slouth / cowardyse / and voluptuosite. For he commaunded vnder great payne that no person shulde be so hardy to sell among the soudyours nouther bread nor other vitayle all reddy dressed saue the cō∣men {pro}uisyon: that the pages / waterlaggers & scolyons shuld nat cōe nere the army / nor folowe the same. That none of the cōmen & simple sodyours shulde kepe or mentayne seruaunt nor beest in theyr tentes nor vyage / whyle they moued fro pla∣ce to place. These inconuenyences first of all he redressed & re∣fourmed. After these amended: all other fautes he mesured by his wysdome / craft / and policy: refourmynge them by lytell & lytell. This done (to haue his soudyours occupyed) he mo∣ued dayly from place to place: and that nat in wayes cōmen & vsed / but by harde and vnoccupyed wayes. He caused them dayly to cast dychesse & trenches about the army / to the intent that they shuld nat waxe slouthfull / nor vicious by ouermoch rest & ydlenesse. He ordayned often watche among them euery nyght: and he hymselfe acompanyed with his vnder captayns and heed officers often serched yf the watches were truely kept / cōpassyng about the army on euery syde. Whyle they re∣moued & chaunged places: somtyme he was in the forwarde and amonge the first: somtyme in the rerewarde or hynder part / and anone in the myddes ouerseynge theyr order to the intent that none shulde passe out of order / aray / and place to them assigned. But kepe thicke togyder euery man & cōpany about theyr owne standerd{is}: and also he ordayned that among themselfe they shulde conuey & cary theyr owne vitayles and
armoure. And thus in short tyme he confermed and sette the army in good order rather with fayre wordes / or rebukyng & blamyng theyr fautes: & prohybityng their dysorder: than in chastisyng or punysshyng their offēces wt rygour or crueltie. ¶Of the behauour of Iugurth agaynst Metel∣lus: and howe he sende embassadours to Metel∣lus requyring vnfaynedly to yelde vp the kyng∣dome of Numidy to the empyre of Rome: And howe Metellus behaued hymselfe agaynst the same embassadours. ¶The .xxix. chapyter. IN the meane seasō whan Iugur∣the vnderstode by messangers & espyes of this behauour of Metellus: and also whā he remembred that which was infourmed to hym at Rome of the integryte and vn∣defyled name of Metellus / whiche wolde nat be corrupte with money nor accloyed with brybes lyke other before: he began to mystruste his mat¦ters and to haue lasse confydence in his cause / thanne euer he had before. In somoche that than he began to laboure to yel∣de hymselfe vnfaynedly / and to make a trewe composytion with Metellus / and the Romayns without any fyction / gy∣le / or disceyt. Wherfore he sende embassadours with supplica∣cions & peticions / requyring humbly of Metellus to graunt to hym his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren onely: and concernyng all other thyng{is} he wolde yelde them into handes of the romayns. But Metellus knewe well ynough long be∣fore this tyme by often experience & profe yt the Numidians of naturall disposicion were vnfaythfull / mouable / and vnstable of myndes: newfangled and moche desyrous of newe besy∣nesse & newelties. Wherfore he began with the embassadours of Iugurth / tastyng and prouyng the mynde of eche of them / by lytell and lytell: and separatly one by one. And whan he knewe that they somwhat inclined to his purpose: he than pro¦mysed to them great gyftes & promocion so that they wold do some pleasure for hym & for the senatours & people of Rome. Than at last he counsayled and desyred them to delyuer Iu∣gurth to hym alyue specially if it myght be brought about: and yf they coude nat so / than to delyuer hym outher quicke or deed. But whan he had made this apoyntement secretly with thembassadours deuyded in sonder one by one: than
openly (that euery man myght here) he shewed to them all to∣gyder other thynges as his pleasure was that they shuld cer∣tyfie their kynge Iugurth concernynge their embassade. After this within fewe dayes whan he sawe his hoost moost redy and contrary to Iugurth he remoued his tentes and so addressed hym with his army redy in aray and went forward into Numidy: where contrary to any similitude of warre the vyllages and cotages were full of men / the feldes full of beest{is} and tylmen: and euery where was moche plenty of people yonge and olde namely rude people & tyllers of the grounde / whiche had styll fled before the army in foretyme for feare / but at the last whan they sawe no defence nor socoure / the kynges lewtenantes and all other left their townes / villages / and lodges / and went forthe to mete Metellus withall humilite / honour / and seruice submittyng themselfe to hym / and redy to gyue to hym whete and other corne suche as they had. And to cary vitayles after his hoost to ease the soudyours and to do and parfourme all other thynges what euer they were com∣maunded. But for all this: Metellus was nat lesse diligent nor circumspect in orderyng of his hoost / but proceded for∣warde togyder with his army ī aray redy in armoure / and de¦fended as if theyr ennemies had ben nere at hande serchynge the countrey abrode on euery syde by his espyes doutynge treason and thynkyng that all these tokens of subiection were but for a face or cloke to couer the treason & gyle of Iugurth. And so by suche dyscet to wayt a tyme to execute his treason. Wherfore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept hymselfe in the forwarde of the hoost with an elect and chosen company of archers / slyngers / and other lyke soudyours apoynted in lyght harnes. His vnder captayne Caius Marius had ru∣le and charge of the rerewarde amonge the horsmen and on bothe the wynges of his hoost he ordayned horsmen & other soudyours for supplement / subsidy / and socouts of the for∣warde yf nede shulde requyre / and amonge them to expell their ennemies on what syde so euer they shulde come / were mengled bowmen and other lyght harnysed fotemen with dartes / pykes / and iauelyns to trouble the horsmen of theyr ennemies. For in Iugurth was so moche gyle so great expe∣rience and knowledge of the countrey / and also so great pra∣ctyse of chyualrie: that a man coude nat well knowe whether he were more to be douted or more greuous in peace or ī ware or whyle he was absent or present. ¶Nat farre from that way whiche Metellus helde with his army was a towne of the Numidyans moche acustomed and frequented of marchantes of Italy and other strange coun∣treis:
and the princypall market towne of all the kyngdome of Numidy. This towne was named Vacca / Metellus dre∣we hym and his army thyder / and set garnyson into the same towne. This dyd he to proue the myndes of the inhabytan∣tes: for if they had kept forth the garnyson / thanne shulde they euydently haue declared themselfe ennemies of the romayns. And also he ledde a garnyson thyder to thintent to haue taken the towne by force of armes / yf the inhabytauntes wolde nat haue admytted the same garnyson. Also he commaunded vy∣tayls / and all other thynges necessary or expedyent to warre for to be brought thyder thinkynge (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes resortyng thyder. And his good prouision of vytayls shulde be great defence and conseruacy∣on for hym and his army bothe in warre and in peace. But whan the citezins sawe such purueyance as he made of vitels considring that he shulde nat hurt nor disprouyde them why∣le he had vytell ynough of his owne prouysion: anon they ope¦ned the gates and suffred hym to entre withall his garnyson and retynue. But in the mean tyme Iugurth agayne sende his embassadours to Metellus more diligently and instaūt∣ly than he had done before / mekely besechyng and requyring hym of peace: And yeldyng vnto hym euery thynge / onely re∣serued his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren. Metellus sende these embassadours home agayne attysed to the prody∣cion of their maister Iugurth as he had done to the other em∣bassadours which were sent before. But concernyng ye peace which they desyred in their maisters name: nouther he graū∣ted nor vtterly denyed it. And in this prolongynge of tyme he loked alway after parfourmynge of the promesse of the other embassadours / whiche before had graunted to the betrayeng of Iugurth. But whan Iugurth consydred and pondered to¦gyder the wordes & dedes of Metellus / and whan he parcey∣ued in mynde himselfe assayled with his owne craftes of sub∣tylte: and that Metellus vsed suche craftes agaynst hym / as he hymselfe had vsed agaynst other: than was his mynd gre∣ued most of all. For Metellus fayned peace / but in very dede he shewed sharpe warre. Iugurth thus cōsydred also: that his greattest towne named Vacca / was alienate & lost from hym: his ennemies by longe continuaunce and exercise knewe the coostes of his countrey of Numidy. The myndes of his lordes and cōmens were prouoked and moued agaynst hym. Whan he aduysed these difficulties with other mo cōtrary to hym he cōcluded & fully determined at last to resyst and with∣stane Metellus in batayle / with strength & force of armes and no farther to meke nor submitte hymselfe by peticion.
¶Howe Iugurth prepared and addressed hym∣selfe agayne to warre: and what ordynaunce and policy he vsed agaynst the newe consull Metellus. ¶The .xxx. chapyter. WHerfore Iugurth thus determyninge to assayle Metellus cause his wayes to be espy∣ed / hauyng hope of victorie by auauncement & auauntage of some place: where he intended of the place and countrey: and anone prepared the greattest army yt he coude of all sortes of people. This done / he dyd so moche that by hylles / narowe passages & by pathes he preuented an ouerpassed the hoost of Metellus. ¶In that parte of Numidy whiche before in deuysion of the kyngdome was assigned in possessyon to Adherball: was a flodde named Muthull / rennyng from the meridyonall part of the countrey. A certayne hyll hy and longe was nere to this water / so that at any place the hyll was about .xx. myle from the streme and of equall dystance in length. The grounde of this hyll was of suche nature that euer it was barayne / wher∣fore it was nat apte to mennes habitacion but desert. About the myddes and pendant of it was an other hyll smaller of quantite: but of an vnmesurable heght couered and all ouer∣growen with wylde olyue trees / with myr trees / & other sor∣tes of trees wont to growe naturally on dry & sandy groūde. The playne bytwene the hylles and the water was desert and vnhabitable for lacke of water: saue such places of the playne as were nere to ye flodd of Muthull which part was growen with small trees and occupyed with men & beestes. Iugurth came to the sayd small hyll whiche descended from the pendāt of the hyll greatter ouerthwart the valey. And ther toke pla∣ce with his army nat togyder but dispersed abrode amonge the trees by companyes and bendes / he made his frende Bo∣milchar capitayne and gouernour of his oliphantes / and of part of his army of fotemen and infourmed hym parfitely howe he shulde behaue hymselfe and gouerne them whome he had commytted to hym bothe before the batayle / and also in the batayle whan it came to the poynt. But he hymselfe drewe nerer to the great hyll withall the horsmen and many of the fotemen whiche were elect and chosen men / and sette them in ordre and array with moche policy and wysedome. This done: he hymselfe went about & compassed euery company / cohort / and bende syngulerly: and one by one warnynge and
requyringe them to call to theyr myndes theyr olde strength{is} nobles / and victorie: and there by to defende themselfe and their countrey of Numidy from the immoderate couetyse of the romayns / whiche were nat content nor tatisfied with the possession of the most part of the worlde / saynge fathermore that they shulde fyght but with suche as they before had auer∣come and subdued. And howe beit they had chaunged theyr capytayne: the cowardise of their hertes was nat chaunged: Also he rehersed & declared to thē that he had made all proui∣sion for them whiche a captayne mygh or ought to make for his army. He declared howe he had taken for them the vpper place: that they were crafty in batayle and many in nombre: & shulde fyght with a fewe vncrafty cowardes. Wherfore he de∣syred & exhorted them whan tyme shulde come that than they wolde be redy to assayle the Romayns manly at sounde of the trumpettes / for that one same day sayd he shulde outher establisshe all theyr laboures / victories / and besynesses: or els it▪ shulde be the heed and begynnyng of their most great mys∣chyefe / and dystruccion. Moreouer through out all his army he put them in remēbrance man by man of ye benefites which he had done to them before for their manly dedes of chyualry: as suche as for their worthynes he had rewarded with digni∣te / money / offices / or other worshyp: and shewed suche vnto other cōmen soudyours sayeng that if they wolde so demeane themselfe manly: so sholde they be promoted and auanced to worshyp and ryches. And thus he conforted them all euery man after his maners and cōdicions / some with gyftes / some with promesses / some with thretnynges / and other lyke ways acordynge to the disposicion of their myndes and nature. ¶Whyle Iugurth thus exhorted his soudyours Metellus nought knowyng of his ennemies apered with his company dyscēdyng downe the pendant of the great hyll whiche at first seyng but fewe men moche marueyled what it myght signi∣fie / for he suspected nothyng lesse than batayle: but in behol∣dyng more intētyfly towarde the toppe of the small hyll afore hym he espyed among the yong trees bothe horse & men whi∣che wer nat fully hyd / bycause of the lownesse of the trees. yet was he incertayne what it myght be. For what by secretnes of the place: and what by gyle of Iugurth / their baners & the most part of the soudyours were obscured & hyd lyeng downe vpon the grounde. But anone after whan he parceyued this gyle & treason: by lytell & lytell / he set his army in array proce∣dynge forwarde styll / as he dyd before / faynynge hymselfe ignorāt of the treason. But he chaunged the order of his sou∣dyours: and on the ryght wynge whiche was next to the Nu∣midyens
his ennemies / he ordayned as it were a forwarde en¦forced with a threfolde subsidy or socoures that is to say with thre bendes of proued soudyours to rescue & helpe them whan nede shuld be. The archers suche as wich slyng{is} shulde cast agaynst their enmis plūmett{is} of led & yron / & all other whiche were of lyght harnes: all these he deuided among the stander∣des of other soudyours as the case requyred: where as after the ryght ordynaunce of batayle / suche soudyours by them selfe deuyded shuld begyn the batayle / but in this batayle the sytuacion of the place nat so requyred. All the hole cōpany of his horsmen he ordred in the extremitees & corners of the fore∣front of the batayle. This done as the breuyte of the tyme suf∣fred he made a short exhortacion vnto his soudyors / & so pro∣ceded forth with his hoost sette in array in maner beforesayd: but bycause Iugurth was on the small hyll before hym and by that meane on the hyer ground he thought to remedy that incōmodite & led forth his hoost on the syde halfe nat towarde Iugurth / but alonge on the hyll towarde the flodde of Mu∣thull / into the playne which was betwene the hyll & the flood. But whan he sawe the Numidyens quyed and that they de∣parted nat from the hyll which they had taken he cōsydred the hete and feruentnes of the somer season. And lyst his army myght perysshe for lacke or scarcite of water: he sent before one of his capitayns named Rutilius with a cōpany of lyght harnessed soudyours and part of his horsmen vnto the flodde named Muthull for to take vp a place wherin they myght set their tentes in tyme of nede: thynkyng that his enemies wyllyng to continue longe in that place by often assaues and scarmysshes shulde disturbe the romayns whyle they resorted to the water. And for asmoche as the Numidiens trusted nat moche in their strength and armoure. He thought that they purposed and intended to trouble his sodyors with werynes and thurst. Whan Rutilius was gone towarde the water / Metellus descended procedyng forth withall by lytell & lytell as the mater and place requyred: he commaunded one named Marius / with his company to kepe in the rerewarde. But Metellus hymselfe with the horsemen kept hym in the lyfte wyng of the forwarde of the batayle / whiche alway remoued forwarde first of all his army. ¶Of the fyrst batayle foughten by∣twene Metellus and Iu∣gurth. ¶The .xxxi. chapyter.
BVt whan Iugurth sawe that the rereward of Metellus was passed his for∣warde: he be set the hyll from whiche Me∣tellus dyscended with two thousande fote∣men by which garnyson if Metellus wold agayn take socour of the same hyll / he shuld be prohibyted & dryuen bacwarde agayne into the handes of Iugurth. This done: sodenly he dyd the trūpetes to be blowen and anone withall / inuaded & set vpon the company of Metellus on euery syde. The Numidyens assayled and bete downe the romayns / some on the rereward and other some dyd their deuoyre to breke the aray on both sy∣des: both on the ryght & lyft wyng / withall their myght assay∣lyng the romayns / and auaunsyng themselfe on euery syde to breke their array and ordynaunce. And after theyr power to trouble / dystourbe / and deuyde them. The romayns whiche were most stable and bolde of myndes in metyng their enne∣mies were abused & dysceyued with the vncertayne batayle. For their ordynaunce and array was set and strengthed one∣ly but on one syde. But their ennemies assayled them on eue∣ry syde: so that sōtyme they were stryken & wounded of their ennemies from farre of / but by no meanes coude they stryke their ennemies agayne nor ioyne wt them. For Iugurth had taught his Numidiens on horsbake before the batayle that whan they shulde begyn to assayle the romayns: they shulde nat kepe themselfe togyder / nor nere / but asmoche dyspersed as they coude / and in diuers places: one company here and and other there. And where the soudyours of Iugurth coude nat auoyed nor repell the romayns whiche assayled them / by∣cause they were mo in nombre: thefore they compassed & trap∣ped them behynde or on the sydes betyn of: and dysioyned from their company. And where it fortuned any of them to fle the Numidyans had more auantage than the romayns. For where they fled into the feldes: they assayled the romayns on the backe halfe or els on bothe sydes in dyuers companyes. But where they sawe it was more auayle and expediēt to fle agayne to the hyll where they set first their ordynaunce. They had also auantage therby for their horses were acustomed to mountaynes and combred wayes / wherfore they mounted with lesse difficultie / but in cōtrary wyse the romayns for the sharpnes of the hylles and lacke of vse coude nat folowe them in their assēdyng without moch difficulte / payne / and paryll. But nat withstandynge that Iugurth and his men had the most auantage of the countrey and grounde / yet the batayle on both sydes was variable / vncertayne / vngoodly / and my∣serable
to beholde: for the best men sonest were slayne and in moost ieopardy. For the courage and valyant myndes & bol∣de hertes of the romayns: was worth the gyle and treason of the Iugurthyns: and so on bothe sydes he which was boldest and moost auaūced hymself was sonest ouerthrowen. Some which were deuyded from their owne company and in hand{is} of their ennemies / gaue place to them and yelded themselfe. And agayne some folowed and chased their ennemies fleyng: where they myght make their{per}ty good: there resysted eyther partie manly. None of both parties kept vnder their stander¦des: nor folowed nat the order of batayle: nor kept none order nor array / but euery man resysted and defended hymself ther where moost ieopardy and paryll was layed to hym: and en∣deuoyred hymselfe to withstande the vyolence of his ennemis with hye valyantise. And so the armour defensyfs / dartes / mē horse / Romayns / Numidyans / soudyours / and pages were all confounded and mengledde togyder: without orde or or∣dynaunce obserued. Nothyng was done with dyscression of the soudyours nor with counsell of the captayns: vnauysed fortune and chaunce gouerned all the bysynesse of that day: so vnstable was the batayle. All was committed to rule of fortu∣ne / And thus passed forth moche of the day in great murder and slaughter / yet styll was the ende of the batayle vncerta∣yne and none knewe whytherpartye shulde haue the vycto∣rye. At last bothe parties with labour and heat began to lan∣guysshe and become wery. Metellus vnderstandynge that the Numidyans lesse resysted infyghtyng than they dyde be∣fore assembled and gathered togyder agayne his soudyours by lytell and lytell / and without tary restored the aray and set them agayne in order. And .iiii. cohortes taken forth of the le∣gyons he set agaynst the fotemen of his ennemies. But before Metellus had thus assembled his company: a great parte of them oppressed with woundes and werynesse / withdrewe thē∣self to the hyll before named and to the hyer places from the ba¦tayle there to refresshe and rest themselfe. But whan Metel∣lus (as sayd is) had reasembled them agayne: he began infe∣we wordes to pray and exhort them in suche maner. ¶O worthy and trusty soudyours and companyons dys∣courage nat your selfe in this batayle / nor lette nat your olde noblenesse nowe fayle you: suffre nat your ennemies wont to put their trust in flyght / nowe to ouercome you by your fere∣full myndes. Remēbre well: if ye be dysposed cowardly to fle: ye haue no tentes / no cyties / no townes / no castels / nor no ma∣ner places of defēce: wherto ye may renne for refuge and saue your selfe. your helth / your hope / & defence is onely in your ar¦moure
and strength: & specially in your bolde hert{is}. Wherfore dere frendes remēbre your olde worshyp: & suffre nat the hole empire of Rome to suffre dysworshyp by your temerous and coward{is} myndes. Remēbre it worthyer to dy in batayle lyke men than to fle / & than to be taken & murdred lyke beestes / or to dye in prison. With these wordes & suche lyke Metellus re∣cōforted the hertes of his soudyours. But in meane tyme Iu¦gurth for his part was nat ydle / quyet nor lesse prouident: but compassed and went about his men cōfortyng and exhortyng them also and praysing their dedes. He renued the batayle al∣so for his part: and among the myddes of his elect soudyours he fought and proued thextremite of euery thyng: and assayd all meanes wherby any auantage myght be wonne cōforting and socourynge his men with wordes / dedes / and exāple. He boldely fought and assayled suche of the romayns as were in fear or dout: and suche as he knewe & proued bolde and sted∣fast / he kept them of with arowes / iauelyns / and dartes that they coude nat approche to their felowes to auaunce them nor to be socoured of them. Thus two worthy men noble and exel¦cent captayns fought & cōtended togyder bytwene themselfe. They themselfe lyke in strength / courage / wysdome / and po∣licy: but of thynges longyng to chyualry vnlyke of prouision. For Metellus had strength of soudyours sufficiently: but the auantage of the countrey and place was moche contrary to hym. But Iugurth had euery thyng necessary and expe∣dyent / saue company of men of armes whiche he wanted. ¶At last the romayns whan they vnderstode that there was no sure place wherto they myght fle: and also that they coude fynde no meanes to fyght with their ennemies indifferently hande to hande. And that the nyght was come vpon them: at last they ascended vpon the toppe of an hyll whiche was ouer agaynst them lyke as Metellus their captayne commaunded them to do. For the Numidyans had lost that place and were fledde and spredde a brode dyspersed / but fewe of them were slayne. For they were swyfte: and the contrey was nat well knowen to the Romayns to pursue them: wherby many of the Numidyans were defended: and so by flyght escapedde. But Iugurth with his horsemen of garde for his body: fledd also from the batell whan he had longe foughten and sawe no¦ne auayle nor auantage. ¶How Bomylchar vndercaptayne of Iugurth and his company were dysconfited by Ruti∣lyus vndercaptayne of Metellus. ¶The .xxxii. chapyter.
IN the mean season Bomylchar / whō Iugurth had made maister of his elyphantes / and of a part of the fotemen (as I haue written before) assone as he sawe that Rutilius (which Metellus had sent vnto the flodde of Muthull to prouide a place for their tentes) was ouerpassed his com∣pany: by lytell & lytell he conuayed and ledde downe his com∣pany into a playne. And whyle this Rutilius hasted hym towarde the flodde as he was cōmaunded of Metellus. Bo∣milchar set his company in order & array styll & quietly as the mater and case requyred. And in meane tyme he forgat nat to serche by espies what Metellus dyd / and what way Rutilius toke toward the sayd flodde: and in what maner he behaued hymselfe & gyded his army. Wherfore after he vnderstode by his espyes that Rutilius with his cōpany had taken their pla¦ce by the sayd flodde where he wold abyde: and was voyde of besynes / quyet / and doutyng no paryll. And on the other syde whan he vnderstode that the cry of the batayle bytwene Iu∣gurth & Metellus encreased: he feared lest Rutilius (if he vn∣derstode therof) wolde leue his place by the flodde: and re∣tourne to the batayle to socour his felowes which were in ieo∣pardy. In this consideracion Bomilchar: where as before he had ordered his army nere togyder by craft and that bycause he mystrusted the courage of his men: and in their boldnesse had no great confidence. Therfore nowe agayne he deuyded them a brode moche larger than they were before: and so pro∣cede towarde the tentes of Rutilyus / to thintent to lette hym and his company on euery syde / if they prepared towarde res¦cous of Metellus. Rutilyus and his company suspectynge no peryll sodaynlie of vnware aduysed great vyolence of smo¦ke and duste styred vp and raysed by mouynge of the groun∣de: but what it myght be they coude nat parceyue by any me∣ane bycause of the thicknesse of the yonge trees that grewe on all the grounde bytwene them which letted their syght. First of all they thought it had proceded of drines of the ground by mouyng of the wynde. But afterwarde whan they sawe the same smoke and dust contynue styll after one maner: and that the same approched alway nerer and nerer lykewyse as the company of their ennemies moued and drewe toward them. Than they parceyued and knewe the mater as it was: and in all hast euery man toke to hym his harnesse: and stode redy be¦fore the defence of their tēres as their captayne Rutilyus had ordred and commaunded them euery man redy at defēce and in aray. After whan their ennemies approched nerer with an horryble noyse and cry / they ranne togyder on bothe parties.
The Numidyens dyd but onely cōtynue the skirmysshe aby∣dynge & lokyng after their elyphātes in helpe of whome was all their trust. But whan they sawe that their elyphātes were stopped & lette with thyckenesse of the bowes of the treis: and so taryed & kept from their socours by the cōpassyng of the ro∣mayns so that in them was no trust of socours. Than all they toke them to flyght with all their power. But many of thē (le∣uyng their armour behynde them) escaped without wounde by helpe of the hylles whych were about the place: which they coude better & quicklyer ascende than the romayns. And also by socour of the darknesse of the nyght (which than was at hande) many of them escaped hole & sounde and saued them∣selfe. Foure of the elyphantes were taken and all the remenāt (fourty in nombre) were slayne. Whan this was done: the cō∣pany of Rutilius / nat withstandynge that they were fatigate and weryed with great iourneis before / and also with moche labour in orderyng of their tentes: & with the sayd batayle or skirmysshe: neuertheles whan they sawe that Metellus their chefe captayne taryed longer than they thought he wold haue done yf all thynge had happened well with hym / they ordred themselfe redy & diligently went backwarde agayne to mete hym. For the falshode and gyle of Iugurth and of the Numi∣dyans caused them to be besy / diligēt / and circumspect in eue∣ry thyng for sauegard of their lyues / & suffred them to do no∣thyng slouly nor with delayeng. But whan they were in their iourney in the darknesse of the nyght the companyes on both parties were nat fare in sondre the one from the other: and bothe parties approched togyder nat knowyng eche other as if they had ben ennemies. The one agaynst the other making noyse and clamour eche one increasyng fear to other as war∣ryours ar wont to do at begynnyng of a batayle. Insomoch that a miserable dystruction & murdre had almost ben cōmit∣ted bytwene them by their imprudēt negligence / if the espyes and horsmen whiche were sent bytwene them on bothe sydes had nat with more diligēce & wyselyer espied the treuth of the mater. But whan the parties knewe eche other / their sadnes and feare tourned to great ioye & gladnesse. The soudyours ioyfully anone met togyder one salutyng & welcomȳg other. One shewed to other their actes done on bothe parties: and ioyous they were to here on bothe sydes euery man commen∣dyng & exaltyng their owne dedes / and also the ded{is} of other vnto heuen with myrthe & gladnesse. And that aswell such as were worthy men as vnworthy cowardys ascrybed to them∣selfe worthynesse. And certes in such busynesse it often happe∣neth / that on that syde which hath the victorie: suche as be but
cowardes / rude and vncrafty / exalteth them / enioyeth / and may bost themselfe on other mennes dedes and worthynesse. But in cōtrary wyse on that partie which is ouercom though many be good warryours / noble & worthy men: yet ar they reputed for coward{is} without policy / bycause of other mennes cowardyse & aduersyte of fortune. Thus fareth it in skirmys∣shes of batayle. But whan Metellus & Rutilius (as I haue sayd before) were mette togyder and rehersed their actes one to other Metellus hasted hym withall his army to the flodd of Muthull / and taryed in the places & tentes whiche Ruti∣lius had prepared & seiourned there the space of foure dayes. In this season he was besy in refresshyng & healyng his sou∣dyours whiche were wounded / suche as manly had behaued themselfe in the batayle he worthely rewarded them / he called them togyder all into one cōpany and greatly landed & com∣mended them: thankyng & moch praysyng them for the great dilygēce / payne / and labors: whiche they had taken in defence of the honour & dignite of their empire with suche wordes. ¶O worthy soudyours ye se nowe that the hardest of our la∣bour is ouerpassed by your boldnesse and manhode: wherfo∣re I exhort you: be ye of lyke courage in the resydue of our be∣synesse / whiche shalbe but lyght & easy in comparyson of this which is ouerpassed. The begynnyng and first brunt of eue∣ry besynesse is hardest. Whiche shall be but lyght vnto bolde and circūspect begynners & constant folowers of their enter∣prises. But this begynnyng ye haue manly ouercome by con∣stant labour as thyng moost easy. ynough haue we foughten all redy for the glorie of victory: for that haue we optayned in this first cōflyer. If we labour or fight any more it shalbe but onely for prayes and robberies of our ennemies: wherby we shalbe enryched in substance: lyke as we nowe be inhaunced with glorie of victory. Wherfore my dere felowes & most con∣stant frendes of the cōmen welth nowe I exhort you for cōple∣ment of all your honorable fame: to remēbre your olde & acu∣stomed worthynesse. And suffre nat this excellent honoure & glorie which ye haue nowe optayned by boldnes: to be quen∣ched and decay agayne by ignomynious cowardyse. ¶With suche wordes & many other lyke Metellus reconfor∣ted his cōpany: & maruelously kyndled their courage to the desyre of honour by valyant feates of armes. But in ye meane season the knowen gyle of Iugurth went nat from his mynd: and therfore to exclude all danger of treason he sent forth cer∣tayne of the Numidiens / which betraynge Iugurth had for∣saken hym & fled to the romayns: & also with thē he sent forthe dyuerse other of his owne company which were expert of the
countrey / and oportune to suche besynesse to serche and espye among what people or in what place Iugurth held hymselfe: and wherin he was ocupyed. Whyther he kept hym wt a small company: or whyther he had an army reassembled for a newe batayle / and how he behaued hymselfe & where about he went syth he was ouercome. But Iugurth had conuayed hymselfe into such places as were full of dychesse / valeis / hylles / treis / busshes / & dales defended of nature. And there had he assem∣bled agayne a newe army of men / mo in nōbre than he had be∣fore. But they were but vncraftie / inerpert / and dull to batell: and coude better tyll the grounde and kepe beestes / than excer¦cyse the dedes of chiualry. For therto had they neuer ben vsed before: but in the other seruyle ocupaciōs & besynesse had they ben ocupyed all their lyftyme without intermixtion of other ocupacion. It fortuned that Iugurth had none other soudy∣ours / but suche rurall people about hym at this tyme namely for this cause. For whan he fled from the batayle foughten be∣fore with Metellus / none of all his soudyours folowed hym / except the horsmen of his garde. For all the other soudyours departed where it lyked them best. Nor this is nat coūted nor reputed for any faute or rebuke among the Numidyens sou∣dyours. For suche is the custome of the countrey: whan the capitayne fleeth the hoost forsaketh hym. ¶what wast and dystruction Metellus made in the lande of Numidy after this first batayle and flyght of Iugurth: and of the gyle of Iugurth agaynst Me∣tellus. ¶The .xxxiii. chapter. WHā Metellus vnderstode by his espyes that the mynde of Iugurth cōtinued yet styll in his olde fyersnesse & crueltie thoughe he was la∣tely ouercome in batayle. And whan Metellus sawe that Iugurth renewed the warre agayne and prepared a newe batayle whiche coude nat be done but at pleasure of Iugurth / bycause he had taken suche a place to abyde in that no man coude cōueniently cōtende with hym for dyfficultie therof. Metellus thus knowyng aduised hymselfe of many thynges. Namely he consydred that they were nat in different & egall on bothe parties in executyng therof. For all yf that he had the vpper hand ouer Iugurth & had put hym to flyght: yet lost he mo men and had more dāmage in ouerco∣myng hym / than Iugurth had whiche was ouercome. For this consyderacion Metellus purposed no more to contende with hym in playne feldes nor in ordered batayle / but by an
other maner to execute the warre with hym from thensforthe. This determyned: Metellus with his hole hoost and ordy∣naunce went forth into the moost ryche and plentyfull places of all Numidy / and there wasted and dystroyed the feldes & coūtrey on euery syde. He toke without any resystence castels and townes / nat strongly defended with walles / dychesse / nor garnyson. And brent and bete them downe to the grounde. All suche as came in his way and were able to bere harnesse: full growen of age or apt to batayle: he slewe and ryd out of hande. Thynkynge that the mo he slewe the fewer aduersa∣ries and ennemies shulde he haue to contende agaynst hym. He cōmaunded his soudyors to spare no robbery nor prayes: but gaue althyng to hauocke among his soudyours. ¶For feare of this crueltie many of the Numidyens yelded themselfe to the romayns: and gaue vnto them hostages / vy∣tayls / sodyours / and all other thynges necessary abundātly. Insome townes whiche were taken: Metellus sette defence and garnyson where nede requyred and fortified them suffi∣ciently. This besynesse troubled the mynd of Iugurth moche more than the batayle that was foughten before to his great dammage and disconfort of his men. For he lost more people by this way than by any other meane before. Thus Iugurth whiche before put all his hope and trust in his flyght: was nowe of necessite compelled to folowe and pursue his enne∣mies: and he whiche coude nat defende his owne places whi∣che styll remayned in his possession: was constrayned nowe to warre in those coostes / which Metellus had wonne of hym to recouer them yf fortune wolde suffre hym. Neuertheles of suche poore shyft and counsell as e had he toke the best which coude be taken by his aduyse in suche extreme necessite. He commaunded his army for the most part to remayne styll in the same place where they were. And he hymselfe with a com∣pany of horsemen whiche were bolde and chosen men ensued Metellus priuely / makyng his iouneis by nyght tyme by / by wayes and secrete valeis. And at last sodenly of vnwas he fell vpon a part of the romayns which were dispersed a brode from the hoost in foragynge and spoylinge. Many of them without armoure were slayne / & many taken. None of them all escaped clene nor fre without dammage / but outher were sayne orels sore woūded. Whan Iugurth had done this skyr∣misshe anone he withdrue hymselfe and his company into the hylles and mountaynes next to them: before any socours or rescous myght come from Metellus to reuenge their treason & deth of the romayns.
¶Of the great ioy which was demeaned at Ro¦me for this worthy behauour of Metellus: and howe he gyded hymselfe and his army to conty∣nue and augment this honour which he had go∣ten. ¶The .xxxiiii. chapyter. WHyle Metellus and Iugurth stry∣ued thus togyder: the one with manhode / wysdome & strength: the other with trea∣son / craft / & gyle: Tidynges were brought to Rome of this noble behauour of Metel¦lus. Ouer all the cite was demeaned great ioye & gladnes for that Metellus behaued hymselfe & gyded his army acordyng to ye maner & ordinaūce of olde noble capitayns of the romayns before his days. And howbeit he was in place aduers & contrary to hym yet had he the vpper hande of his ennemies as victorie ouer them. And by his strength & manhode he had in possession the coūtrey of his ennemies: & had driuen them from place to place. All these thyng{is} cōsydred: they moch reioyced & greatly cōmended Me¦tellus: namely for that he had caused Iugurth to put his trust of helth onely in fleyng into the moūtayns & wyldernesse / whi¦che before was magnificent & proude by the fear & cowardyse of Aulus predecessour of Metellus. Wherfore for these fortu∣nat & glorious dedes of Metellus / the senatours decreed and cōmaūded ouer all the cite sacrifices & suffrages to be done to their ydolles. The citezyns whiche before were ferefull & sore troubled doutyng the vnsure chaūce & incertayne fortūe of the ende of this warre: demened nowe amonge them myrthe and gladnesse ouerall. The honoure & fame of Metellus was re∣coūted very noble / excellēt / & gloryous in euery mannes mou∣the. Wherfore he somoche was the more dyligent and labou∣red more besely towarde the vyctore laboringe & hastynge to finysshe the warr by all meanes & wayes so it might be to his honour & cōfusion of Iugurth. But neuertheles he was well ware from puttyng hymselfe in danger of his ennemies: and was ware exchuynge oportunite of their gyle in euery place where he went. He remēbred well & cōsydred that often after laude & glorie foloweth enuy & euyl wyll. And therfore howe moche more noble that he was reputed: the more besy & dily∣gent he was to mentayne his fame & honour / & in drede to lose this worthy fame which he had optayned. Nor after the fore∣sayd gyle of Iugurth he suffred nat his hoost to deuide nor to departe themselfe dysparsed one from other: nor to make ex∣courses
to forage or spoyle in diuers places far dystant in sondre. But whan they had nede outher of mannes meate or horsemeate: all the horsemen with great cōpanyes of the fote∣men / went forthe & kept them nere about suche as were sende forthe to make prouision to defende and socour them: if nede shulde requyre. Metellus hymselfe deuyded his hoost in two partes: the one part he kept with hymselfe: & the other he com¦mytted to a noble warriour of his hoost named Marius / by∣twene them both they dystroyd & wasted the contrey on euery syde / but rather with fire than wt robbry or prayes. Metellus & Marius set their tentes in two places nat far distāt in sondre. But whan any perylous or nedy besynesse was to be done wt Iugurth or his cōpany whiche requyred great myght: than anone Metellus & Marius were redy togyder: but they kept themselfe thus in sonder in dyuerse places to trouble the Nu∣midiēs / and increase their feare more largely in euery cost: & to make them fle and auoyde fer abrode in compasse for fear. ¶At this season Iugurth ensued by the hylles and desert pla¦ces sekyng and espyeng a conuenient season or place to make some skyrmysshe with the romayns (that is to say) if he coud espy any parcell of them sekyng forth fountayns of water for the army of the which was moch penury in those costes. If he myght any such espy than anone wold he breke downe frō the hylles vpon them. Somtyme he shewed hymselfe to Metel∣lus / somtyme to Marius / somtyme he wold assemble his cō∣pany togyder in a bend as if he wold fyght with the romains to attēpt them / & anone aft wold he retourne agayne vnto the mountaynes. And afterwarde sodenly appere agayne thret∣nyng nowe the one cōpany of the romayns / & nowe the other. yet wold be neyther auēture batayle nor suffre neyther the ro∣mayns to be ydle or in rest / nor yet hymselfe. His mynde was onely sette to kepe his ennemies from their begynnyng & pur∣pose of distroyeng of the countrey whiche they intended. ¶Howe Metellus besyeged Samam one of the strongest townes of Numidy: and howe Marius vnder captayne of Metellus escaped the danger of Iu∣gurth. ¶The .xxxv. chapter. WHan Metellus sawe hym selfe so we∣ryed with the gyles and craftes of Iugurth / and that by no policy he coude haue faculty or tyme to fight with hym in playne batayle: at last he cōcluded to besyge & assayle a great towne na∣med zamam / whiche was the most chefe & strongest holde of
all the realme of Numidy in that part of the lande where it was buylded. And so sped hym thyder withall his army and ordinance where the sayd holde was (thynkyng as the mater requyred) that Iugurth wolde drawe thyder for defence of his chife towne and for socour and relefe of his people and so shulde the batayle be there foughten bytwene them. But whā Metellus was in his iourney thyderwarde / anone were cer∣tayn of his army which fled to Iugurth and certified hym of this prouision and interprise of Metellus. Whan Iugurth herof was certified he hasted hym by gret iourneis so that he ouerpassed the cōpany of Metellus and came to the towne of zamam before hym: & there exhorted the inhabitantes boldly to defende the walles. And farthermore assigned to socour & helpe them all suche as had fled from the romayns / and had brought hym those tidyng{is}. These treatours were the surest men whiche Iugurth had. For they coude nat dysceyue hym / but if they wolde yelde them agayne to the romayns whome they had forsaken and betrayed which thyng was nat sure to them to do. Whan Iugurth had ioyned these soudyours to the garnison and socours of the towne and castell / and had or∣dred & apoynted all other thynges acordynge to his mynde: than he promysed to be there agayne with them with all his hole army in tyme of nede. This done he departed from the towne into the most preuy & secret places which he knewe in his countrey therby But whan Metellus was in his iourney towarde zaman / he sende Marius for prouision of whete and other corne & vitayle for the army vnto a towne named Sic∣ca / whiche was the first towne that forsoke Iugurth & was yelded to Marius after the batayle late foughten with Iu∣gurth to his great damage. Whan Iugurth had knowledge herof he went thyder by nyght priuely with his elect soudyors so that whan Marius had sped his maters & was redy to de∣parte forth of the towne: Iugurth was redy at the gates to assayle the romayns cruelly cryeng with a hye voyce to them of the towne & exhortynge them to assayle the romayns also on the backe halfe: saynge that fortune had offred to them the chaunce of a noble act / of an excellent & glorious dede: so that (yf they wolde folowe his desyre) they shulde restore hym agayne into his kyngdome & themselfe into their libertie and from thensforth passe their tyme without peryll / without dan¦ger or drede. And certaynely if Marius had nat boldely and strongly broken out of the towne with his standerdes & men of armes through the thickest of his ennemies whiche were in the gates. All they of the towne or the most part wolde haue broken theyr oth and promesse / whiche they had made before
to Metellus whan they first yelded themselfe and the cite is hym. The myndes of the Numidiens be so vnstedfast and mouable. But Iugurth so conforted his soudyours that they resysted the romayns a lytell season. But whā Marius and his company began to encrease their violence agaynst the Iugurthyns and more fiersely to prease vpon them. Anone some were slayne and the resydue fled with their maister Iu∣gurth. This daunger ouerpassed: Marius departed thens towarde the towne of zaman / and at the last came thyder safe with all his cōpany and besynesse sped wherfore he was sent. ¶This Samam was a towne bylded in the playne groūde without hylles or waters nere it defended rather by ye warke of mannes hande / than by nature of the place. In it fayled nothyng necessary to batayle. For it was well garnissed both with men / ordynaunce / vitayls / and armour. Anone whan Marius was come: Metellus acordynge to the tyme and place made redy all thynges necessary and compassed the walles on euery syde wt his army: assignynge to euery one of his vndercapitayns a separate place of the towne to assayle and there to do his deuoyre and shewe his manhode. Whan euery thynge was thus ordred Metellus commaunded to sounde to the assaut with trumpettes and clayons. The ro∣mayns immediatly assayled the towne on euery syde wt hor∣ryble noyse & clamoure. The Numidiens therof were nat a drad at all: but abode styll and kept them selfe in sylence as if they had nat ben displeased nor prouoked to batayle: howe¦beit they kept the walles euery man on the part to hym assi∣gned & all were redy to resyst & to assayle the romayns. Anone the batayle was begone. The romayns exercysed and occu∣pyed themselfe euery man wt suche wepyn as he coud best han¦dell and was most expert in: some with slynges thrue plum∣mettes of leed / and some stones from a farre into the cyte / and at them whiche defended the walles / some assayled the towne nerer inuadyng the same / and couetyng to haue entre and vn∣dermyning the walles / some boldly escaled walles desirynge to come so nere that they myght fyght hande to hand. On the othersyde thinhabitauntes of the towne and garnyson resy∣sted manly. Some rowled downe and ouertourned great & weyghty stones on suche as were nerest to them / and that vn∣dermyned the walles. Some pytched downe vpon them dar¦tes / iauelyns / pykes / firebrandes: and also great brennynge polles / faggottes / and blockys ouercouered with pytche and brēstone ardenly flamyng. Some boldly ouertourned the sca¦lyng ladders and slewe & ouerthrue suche as scaled the walles
But some other whiche were farther from the towne and for prease coude nat approche nere to the walles in the meane sea∣son were nother fearfull nor ydell. For there was no maner instrument of batayle whiche coude be throwen with hande / or with any other ingyne of batayle: but that they thrue it into the towne / wherwith they wounded and slewe many of the inhabitantes and of the defenders of the walles. The dartes and crosbowes on bothe parties were nat vnoccupyed. Artel∣lery nor gonnes had they none. For at that tyme was no mencion of them nor they were nat yet inuent. The romains which were farthest of all from the walles escaped nat fre: but with dartes were ouerthrowen in great nombre. Howe beit their cowardous and fearfull myndes caused them to drawe themselfe aloufe behynde all other for to saue themselfe / yet coude they nat auoyde the paryll. Thus were the wrthy and vnworthy of the romayns in lyke ieopardy and paryll: but their glory and fame was moche vnlyke. ¶Howe Iugurth assayled and inuaded the ten∣tes of the romayns in the meantyme whyle Me¦tellus gaue assaut to the towne of zammam. ¶The .xxxvi. chapyter. WHyle the assaut contynued thus at zammam / with great murdre & distruction on both {per}ties: Iugurth sodenly and of vn∣ware stale downe from the mountaynes where he was hyd / and with a great power of men assayled & inuaded the romayns ten¦tes whyle the soudyours whome Metellus had assygned to the warde & defence of them were within the same at their rest: and suspecting nothing lesse than any suche assaut. Wherfore Iugurth brake in vpon them vnprouyded. The romayns were sore abasshed of that soden feare. And euery man prouided for hymselfe / acordynge to his maners and dysposycion. Some whiche were cowardes fled withall their myght / some other valiant and bolde herted men drewe to their harnes and manly withstode their ennemies. Neuer∣thelesse the moost parte of them all were / outher wounded or slayne. But among all the company and of all the multitude of them were no more but .xl. men whiche abode. These .lx. acompanyed themselfe togyder remembryng the worshyp of the empire of Rome / and toke a place a lytell aboue their en∣nemies: whiche place they defended so manly that they coude
nat be driuen from it by moche violence of their ennemies / agaynst whome they thrue dartes from a far. And suche dar∣tes as their ennemies thrue at them: they thrue ye same agayn. So they beynge but a fewe agaynst so many dyd nothyng in vayne. For they coude throwe no dart / but that it lyghted a∣mong the thyckest of them. But so coude nat their ennemies do agaynst them. For they were so fewe: so nere togyder: & on so sure a place that their enmies myght lytell thynge preuayle agaynst them. But whan the Numidiēs approched nerer to them: than specially these .xl. valiant romayns shewed and bestowed thier manhode & strength wt most excellent courage assayling their enmies: ouerthrowyng & chasyng them back∣warde by very force & strēgth. ¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus was most of all ocupyed and besyed in the forsayd assaut of zamam: sodenly he herde behynde hym a great cla∣mour & noyse of people. Anone he refrayned his horse: and in tournyng backe parceyued great cōpanyes of men rennynge towarde hym: wherby he well knewe that they were of his owne people & cōpany. But whā he vnderstode all the chaūce which was be fallen. Anone in all hast he sent all the hole com∣pany of his horsmen vnto his tentes: & soone after he sent thy∣der also his chife vndercaptayne Caius Marius with his re∣tynue & company to hym assigned. And sore wepyng he obte∣sted exhorted / and besaught hym for all loue & frendshyp: and for honour of ye cōmen wayle / that he wolde nat suffre any dis∣worshyp or cōtumely remayne in the romayns that day whi∣che euerthytherto had ben victorious and ouercomers with great laude and honour: and that he wolde nat suffre their en∣nemy Iugurth and his cōpany to depart away vnreuenged. Marius dyd the cōmaundemēt of Metellus and that shortly. But in the meane season Iugurth perceyued many of the ke∣pers of the tentes fallen into the dyches that were made about the same for defence: so that for hast to ronne away they hurt themselfe more / than he dyde. Iugurth aduysing their daun∣ger cōsydred that hymselfe was lyckely to be let vnder the sa∣me maner yf he auentured ouer farre. And therfore he depar∣ted betyme into the surest places that he coude deuyse nere by leauynge many of his men behynde: outher deed or mortally wounded. Thus was Marius frustrat of his labour: for Iu¦gurth was fled before he came to the tentes. But Metellus (without any thyng brought to ende at zamā) whā the nyght drewe nere: retourned with his hoost into his tentes. On the next morne after / before he retourned agayne to the assaut of zaman: he cōmaunded all the cōpany of his horsmen to course vp and downe before their tentes on that syde wher they sup∣posed
Iugurth wolde come to socour his people. The entres into the tentes and places nere to them he commytted and de∣uided to warde of his vnder capitayns. After that he retour∣ned agayne to the towne and fiersly assaylyd the walles in lyke maner as he had done the day before. ¶In the meane season Iugurth agayne sodenly stale vpon the romayns: & specially on them which coursed before the ten¦tes: they whiche wer next hym & whōe he encoūtred first of all were a lytell tyme sore troubled & abasshed: but the remenant of the romayns lyghtly assembled their socours. And so va∣lyantly behaued themselfe that the Numidiēs shuld nat long haue cōtinued the skyrmysshe: if their fotemen myngled with the romayns horsmen had nat in the mydell cōmytted great myschefe and dystruction. For the horsemen of Iugurth tru∣styng to ye helpe of these fotemen which wer myngled among them: dyd nat first procede forwarde auaūcing themselfe and than retourne backe agayne as the vse is in a batayle of spere men. But they ran in makynge incourses among the thyckest of the romayns ouerthwart and sydeling{is}: infoldyng & dow∣blyng theyr courses: and cōtendyng to trouble & dysorder the array and order of the forwarde and wynges of the romayne hoost. Insomoche that what with the Numidyens on horse∣backe & with them on fote it lacked but lytell: but the romains were confounded and ouercome in that greuous conflict. ¶But here wyll I leue the horsmen of the romains fightyng for their lyues and honour agaynst Iugurth and his spere∣men. And nowe shall I declare howe Metellus the chefe capitayn of the romayns behaued hymselfe with his hoost in the assaut of zammam. ¶How Metellus behaued himself for his part & of the great cōflyct which the romayns had aga∣ynst the Numidyans: Metellus with his fotmē assaylinge the towne of zāmam for the one part: and Iugurth fiersly fighting with the romayns speremen for the other part. The .xxxvii. chap. IN the same tyme whyle this skirmys∣she cōtinued bytwene the romains horsmen and the Numidyēs / whiche were with Iugurth: the assaut also agaynst the towne of zammam indu∣red with moche strengthe / violence and mur∣der. And specially wher as Metellus had assigned his vnder
captayns on euery syde of the towne (as I haue sayd before) there cōtynued the assaut most sharply. One of them put nat his trust nor hope in other: but euey man in his owne dedes & in hymselfe. Vnder the same maner dyd the garnyson & inha∣bitantes of the towne behaue themselfe: they fought manly agayne & also ordayned all thynges cōuenient for their defen∣ce in euery place of the towne. Bothe the parties were redyer and more besye one to stryke & wounde other than to defende themselfe. The clamoure & noyse was myxt with exhortacion and confort of some / and the ioye of the quellars & murderers was mingled with the wayling of them which were quelled & murdred. The sounde of the armoure / horrious and strokes mounted to the ayre. The sky was darked with dartes fleyng on eyther syde. And the walles & dychesse were dyed wt blode: and fylled with deed corses pytefull to se. But whan the Nu∣midiens were somwhat at layser / and whan the romayns a lytell abated & remitted the assaut: than they whiche defended the walles of the towne loked out a farre & intentifely behelde the batayle of the horsmen which styll cōtinued. There myght one haue sene them somtyme mery & ioyous / somtyme full of dolour & heuynesse after as they sawe the case of the part of Iugurthe went forwarde or bacwarde. And aswell as they coude be sene & herde of their felowes which were with theyr kyng Iugurth: some warned them to audacite / some exhorted them to courage / other they gaue them signes wt their handes or with the iesture of their bodyes & cōtenances mouyng and excityng them to boldnesse. If they sawe a romayne stryke a Numidyan: they moued & withdrue their bodyes auoyding the stroke as yf it had ben themselfe whiche had ben striken. And if they sawe a Numidyen cast a dart agaynst a romayn: they moued their bodyes also as they had cast it themselfe. Thus toke they so intentife hede to the batayle that they for∣gate themselfe where they were / and it semed them that they had ben with their felowes in batayle. Whan Marius which besyged the towne on that syde: vnderstode this maner & be∣hauour of the inhabitaūtes & garyson: he abated his fiersnes for policy & was more slowe in besyegyng of the towne than before fayning that he had no trust nor cōfidence to wynne it and suffred the Numidyens within the towne to beholde the batayle of their kynge / for a whyle without any resystence or besynesse. But whā he sawe them most intentifely beholdyng the batayle / & most amased for the besynesse of their felowes & countrey men: than sodenly withall his power he gaue assaut to the walles so that many of the romayns with ladders and other ingynes / had almost mounted vnto the hyghest part of
them. Thynhabitantes seynge this expelled their amasednes remembryng themselfe: and ran manly agaynst them with re¦systence throwyng vpon them stones / fyre / & all maner dartes of batayle. The romayns at begynnyng resysted valiantly / defendyng themselfe and auancyng them to the walles. But whan thinhabitantes had first ouerthrowen and broken one ladder / and than ouertourned an other. They whiche abode last were maymed or slayne. Anone the remenant departed & gaue ouer the walles vnder the best maner that they coude a fewe or none hole. For a great part of them withdrewe them∣selfe transfired with mortall wondes. Anone after the nyght fell vpon them whiche caused both the parties to desyst / and leue of the batayle. ¶How Metellus remoued the siege from zam∣mam: & howe Bomylchar so {per}swaded Iugurth that he yelded hymselfe / his kyngdome / and all other thynges / to mercy & grace of the romayns. And howe Iugurth after losse of his men / trea∣sour / elephantes / armour / and horse: changed his mynde agayne. ¶The .xxxviii. chapyter. BVt whan Metellus sawe his pur¦pose and labour all in vayne: and that he coude nat wynne the towne. and also that Iugurthe dyd nought / but by gyle and falshode / nor wolde nat fight but yf it were in places for his profet & great auantage. And also whā he perceyued that the somer was passed: he departed from the siege of zāmam: & in suche townes as he had won of Iugurth whiche were strongly de∣fended with walles & water: he set garnyson & soudyours of his cōpany to defende them. But the remenant of his army he cōuayed & ordred in the next {pro}uince vnto Numidy / which was subget to the romayns: to remayne there tyll the sharp∣nesse of the wynter were passed. Nr in the meane tyme he suffred nat them / nor hymselfe to be corrupted wc superfluous welth / rest / nor lechery: after the maner of other before hym. But bycause the warre proceded forwarde but lytell with ar∣mour or strength: he begā to proue & prepare treason agaynst a treatour / dysceyt agaynst a dysceyuer: and gyle agaynst gy¦le of Iugurth: and this thought he to proue by suche as were moost chefe frendes of Iugurth & most familyer about hym. So that he purposed to vse the falshode and treason of them
agaynst their maister: in stede of armour and batayle. Wher∣fore first of all he began to proue the mynde of Bomilchar whiche had ben before at Rome with Iugurth: and (as I ha¦ue sayd before) fled priuely frō thens for the deth of Massiua / leuyng his sureties behynde ī danger for his cause. Metellus consydred that this Bomilchar (by cause of the great frend∣shyppe and familiarite whiche he had with Iugurth) sonest myght dysceyue and betray hym. Wherfore (as I haue sayd before) he began and went in hande with hym first of all by promisyng of great rewardes. And first of all he dyd somoch: that this Bomilchar came priuely to Metellus & spake with hym. Metellus anone promysed hym on fayth & treuth to do so for hym: that the senatours shuld pardon hym of all thyng{is} past / and of his lyfe & goodes. So that he wolde betray or de∣lyuer vnto hym Iugurth other quycke or deed: lyghtly he persuaded the numidyan. For anon Bomilchar agreed ther∣to: what for his treaterous & false mynde which he had of na¦ture. And what for that he douted if any peace or composicion after that shulde be made bytwene Iugurth & the romayns hymselfe shuld be delyuerd by cōdycion to the romayns to be punisshed for ye deth of Massiua whom he caused to be slayne at Rome. This Bomilchar whan he sawe his tyme toke leue of Metellus on this apoyntement: and sone after came to Iu¦gurth whome he founde doutefull in care and bewayling his aduers and myserable fortunes with profunde syghes and heuynesse / and doutyng what way was most expedient to be taken. Bomilchar after many wordes beganne to counsell & warne hym / praynge / and obtestyng hym / pyteously wepyng and wayling: and requyring that at last he wolde make some prouision for the sauegarde & socours of hymselfe / of his chil¦dren & frendes: and for the people of Numidy which well had deserued agnenst hym to be prouided for and better sene to. Bomilchar also obiected to Iugurth howe he and his menne were ouercome in euery batayle / and his people also diminis∣shed or alyenate from hym / his feldes and townes wasted & distroyd or els in possession of his ennemies / his men some taken & in prison. Some slayne: and many wounded & may∣med / the rychesse of his realme dyminisshed and wasted. Bo∣milchar alleged also to hym that he had proued the strength of his soudyours and fauour of fortune sufficiently ynough / wherfore it were better for hym to se some remedy and proui∣sion for all these ylles and other mo / and to beware lest whyle he prolonged the tyme and douted: the people of the countrey shulde prouide for themselfe without his aduise or counsell. With these wordes and other lyke Bomilchar induced the
kynges mynde to make some cōposicion or els to yelde hym∣selfe / and all other thynges to mercy & grace of the romayns. Anone embassadors were sende to Metellus to certify hym that Iugurth was redy to do what euer he wolde desyre or cōmaunde hym: and that he wolde cōmyt & yelde bothe hym∣selfe and his kyngdome to the fayth & grace of Metellus: and of the romayns without any pactyon / conuenaunt / or ex∣ception: sauyng onely as it pleased them to deale with hym. Metellus heryng of this mynde of Iugurth was very glade: and cōmaunded all the most wyse / noble / & worthy men of his army anone to be called togyder vnto hym from their wyn∣tryng places. Whan they were cōe than toke he coūsell of them & of other suche as he knewe wysest & most discrete touchynge the embassade of Iugurth. Anone it was cōcluded & decreed among the counsell and declared to the embassadours (acor∣dyng to the olde custome of Rome) that they shuld cōmaunde Iugurth to sende to Metellus & the romayns two hundred thousande pounde weyght of syluer: all his elyphātes which he ocupyed in warre: and a certayne quantite of armour and a nōbre of his chife horse. All these thyng{is} were fulfylled and done of Iugurth without any tary or delay. Wherfore anone after Metellus cōmaunded agayne that all they whiche had betrayed his hoost / forsaken hym & fled to Iugurth shuld be bounden & so brought to hym agayne. The most part of them were brought as he cōmaūded: but a fewe of them whan they herde first of this cōposicion (feryng the same mater) fled vn∣to Bocchus kyng of the moryens. ¶Whan Iugurth after this maner was bereft of his armour of his horse / of his men / & also of his treasour. Anone after he was called by Metellus to come to a towne called Tysidium there to here what farthermore shulde be cōmaūded to hym: & to yelde hymselfe to thempire of Rome acordynge to his em∣bassade. But he began than to change & to tourne his mynde agayne dredyng for the knolegyng of his cruell dedes that he shuld neuer escape cōdigne punysshemēt if he were ones ī the romayns handes. Thus he cōtynued many dayes in douring what was best to be done. Somtyme he volued in mynde ra∣ther to subdue hymselfe to any difficultie & to byde all paynes than to begyn warre agayn: cōsydring the aduers & vnhappy fortune whiche he had before. Somtyme agayne he called to mynde how greuous a fall it shuld be to descēde from a kyng∣dome into subiection and bondage. But at cōclusion whan in vayne & to none effect he had lost suche great ordynaunce and helpe of warre as he had lately delyuered to Metellus: as a volage brayned man / he fully determined agayne to begyn &
continue the warre with Metellus: rather than to yelde hym selfe to deth or captiuite. ¶But durynge this season at Rome was a counsell amonge the senatours concernyng thassignement of rule and gouer∣naunce of the prouinces belongynge to thempyre: in whiche counsell it was decreed that the countrey and warre of Nu∣midy shulde be commytted to Metellus / by prorogacion of his authorite for another yere more. ¶But here wyll I leue a whyle to speke of Metellus: & write of the ambicion of Marius: and how he behaued hymselfe in supplantyng the same Metellus for his rowme & dignite. ¶How Marius by ambition laboured to be cō∣sull and to prosecute the warre of Numidy: and how he detracted and supplāted the consull Me∣tellus. ¶The .xxxix. chapyter. AT the same season the sayd Mari∣us was in a towne named Vtica / and there made supplicacion & oblacion to the ydol∣les with moche sacricfice to the intent that it myght be his fortune (by helpe) to haue the place of Metellus. A custome damna∣ble was among the people at those dayes: whan they slewe any beest in sacrifice: to loke within the in∣trayles and bowelles of ye same best so sacrifised. where was shewed vnto them dyuers tokens whyther they shuld haue a∣ny hope to bring that mater to effect: for which they sacrifised or els nat. And often tymes the wycked spyrites to cause them {per}seuer in their ydolatry: and to gyue credēce to that blynd er¦rour shewed many tokēs to thē insuch maner sacrifice: which tokens they often founde true. But now to my purpose. The preest of the ydolles whiche sacrifysed for Marius shewed great and marueylous tokens vnto hym: wherby he myght greatly trust to come to his intent and purpose / byddyng hym prosecute that thyng on whiche he had sette his mynde: and haue sure confydence in his goddes. Sayng that if he wolde proue the extremite of fortune diligētly and often: than dout∣lesse euery thynge prosperously shulde happen to hym. But Marius afore that tyme: longe season wonderously desyred in his mynde the dignite of the consull. And to say trueth he wanted nothyng which longed to hym / whiche shulde haue such a dignite saue onely antiquite of his progeny and aun∣cient noblenesse of byrthe. For thought he were but a gentyl∣man
of the first heed: neuerthelesse his cōdicions were worthy and excellēt. In hym was great experiēce of wysdome, moche probite / honestie / and sadnesse. He had great polycy and con∣nyng in chyualry: in batayle his mynd was excellent & bolde. But in peace it was lowe and moderate. He ouercame coue∣tyse and sensualite of his body. He desyred nor coueyted no∣thyng erthly saue glorie / laude / and worshyp. This Marius was borne & brought vp by all his chyldhode in the countrey of Champayne beyonde Fraūce in a towne named Arpyne. But assone as he was encreased / so that he myght bere har∣nesse and byde the hardnesse of warfare: he concluded to lyue on the wages of chyualrie. And in that study he exercysed hymselfe: and nat in eloquence of greke langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the superfluous aparayle nor car∣nall lustes of citezins vnto which he neuer subdued his body. And thus was he indued with good maners: and excercysed among honest ocupacions and so continued that his hole and vndefyled with shortly encreased & exalted himselfe growyng to honour and vertu. First whan this Marius desyred of the cōmenty of Rome to haue an office: that is to say / to be orday∣ned protectour of the soudyours: many of the citezins knewe nat his persone: bycause he was alway from the cite in warre & batayle: but his actes made his name well knowen. Wher∣fore after that the cōmenty vnderstode that he was Marius of whose nobles all Italy moch cōmuned & talked: anon they graunted his peticion / and proclamed hym protectour of the soudyours ouer all the prouinces & tribes of Italy. In that maistership & office he behaued hymselfe so well & wysely that after that he obtayned an other office of more worshyp and authorite: and after that agayne an other of hyer dignite. And shortly to speke: in euery office and dignite he so behaued hymselfe that euery man thought and counted hym worthyer of more dignite and honour than he had. Howe beit for all these condicions: as honorable as he was: he durst neuer be∣fore desyre thoffice of consull of Rome tyll this tyme whan he had suche cōfort by his sacrifice. But whan he was thus war∣ned and put in hope and confort / euer after he was hedelyng enclined to ambicion and couetyse of that dignite. ¶At this season the cōmenty of Rome had all other offices among them or at their gyft and dystribucion. But the esta∣tes and noble men kept among them and in their handes the consulshyp yerely one succedyng other by election. So that of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of dedes / but that was reputed vnworthy of that dignite / and as who sayth vyle and polluted. But whan Marius sawe and con∣sydred
that the wordes and counsell of the enchauntour and preest which behelde his sacrifice pretended to the same poynt and conclusion as the desyre of his mynde moued hym longe before. Anone he came to his capitayne Metellus / besechyng hym to be dyscharged of the batayle tyll he myght go to Ro∣me to thintent to desyre the consulshyppe of the senatours. But how beit that in this Metellus was vertu / glorie / wor∣shyp / and all other thynges longynge to a good man plen∣tifully ynoughe. Neuerthelesse of his courage and mynde was he sōwhat proude / despisyng & dysdaynyng other: whi∣che were nat come of so hy lynage as he was. But specially he was stately and proude of mynde: whiche is a cōmen vyce and myschefe among estates and gentylmen. Wherfore Me∣tellus heryng this interprise of Marius / first of all was mo∣ued with the newelty of his peticion. For at that tyme were none wonte to speke for that dignite / but if they were come of a noble stocke. And so was nat Marius. And thus Me∣tellus marueyled moche at his enterpryse: and who myght counsell hym therto: warnynge hym as vnder colour of a∣myte and frendshyppe / nat to presume vpon so contrary and vnlikely a thyng: nor to exalte his mynde so hy aboue fortune cōuenient for his state and cōdicion. Sayng also to hym that euery thing was nat to be coueyted nor desyred of euery man. And that it became hym well by reason to be cōtented / pleased and satisfied with that honour whiche he had & that was his owne / and nat to desyre thyng{is} vnmete for his degre. And fi∣nally he exhorted & coūselled hym to beware to desyre yt thing of the Romayns which laufully might be denyed vnto hym: cōsydring and hauyng regarde to his lynage & auncety. ¶After Metellus had coūselled Marius with these wordes and other lyke: and that he coude nat tourne nor apease his mynde / he answered hym at last that assone as he coude cōue∣niētly (nat lettyng the besynesse of the cōmen wele) he wolde graūt his desyre & peticion. But after this whan Maius de∣syred the same dyscharge importunely & often: he made hym answere sayng that he shulde nat make so great hast to Rome for that purpose for he shuld come tymely ynough to demaūde that dignite acōpanyed with the sonne of the same Metellus / whiche sonne shulde also go to Rome in tyme to come to de∣maūde of the senators the same dignite with Marius. This sonne of Metellus was at that tyme in the army of his father Metellus cōtinually exercisyng the feates of warre nat with∣standynge that he was but .xx. yere of age. This answere of Metellus styred Marius agaynst hym with greuous yre & wrath / what for the honour whiche he desyred: and what for
the licence to depart / whiche he coude nat optayne of hym by no prayer nor request at his pleasure. In somoche that he en∣raged agaynst Metellus moued by desyre of that office and prouoked by yre / whiche two vices ambicion & yre counselled and impelled this Marius to moch yll agaynst the sayd Me∣tellus / sparyng nouther worde nor dede whiche myght enda∣mage or hynder hym / his honour and name. And that myght helpe or auaunce hymselfe by ambicion to come to the dignite whiche he desyred. He gouerned the soudyours which passed forthe the wynter vnder his gouernaunce nat as he ought to do: but suffred them to haue their pleasure to thintent therby to optayne their fauour and goodwyll in his enterprise. Also he spake often in blamyng Metellus / & proudly cōmendyng & exaltyng hymselfe vnto the marchantes of Rome: of whome was great resort and cōcours to the sayd cite of Vtica where Marius soiourned. And often tymes he boosted sayenge to them that if the one halfe of the army were graunted and cō∣mytted to hym within fewe dayes he wolde behaue hymselfe that he wolde haue Iugurth in bondes and subiection. Fa∣thermore he sayed to them in auancynge hymselfe that Me∣tellus prolonged the batayle for the nonest / for a craft bycause he was a man pompous and desyrous of glorie & worshyp / vtterly reioysinge in authorite and gyuen to pride and affe∣ction of dignite: and bycause he knewe well that whyle the ba¦tayle continued he shuld be reputed in maner as a kyng / ther∣fore he dyd his deuoyre the more to prolonge the warre to thende that in the meane tyme he myght exalte and magnify hymselfe. The wordes of Marius semed to the sayd marchā∣tes certayne and true / and also as they thought (by suche in∣formacion) moost expedient to the commen wayle that some newe capitayne were chosen / whiche shortly wolde finysshe that warre. For by long contynuance of the same warre: ma∣ny of the sayd marchantes had wasted & spent moche of their substance and richesse. And also to such desyrefull myndes as they had / nothyng coude to fast be hasted or brought to ende. ¶Moreouer at this season was in company of the romayne army a certayne Numidyan named Gauda / whiche was sonne of Manastaball: and neuewe vnto Massinissa. Mi∣cipsa in his testament ordayned that this Gauda shulde be se∣conde heyre of Numidy / after the deth of his two sonnes and of Iugurth. This Gauda was sore enfebled with dyseases and syckenesse: and for that cause his mynde was a lytell en∣dulled and priuate of reason and memorie. Whyle this Gau∣da (as sayed is) was in the romayns army: he requyred of
Metellus to suffre hym to haue his seat and siege next vnto hym after the vse of kynges of Numidy. Also after that by∣cause of defence and garde of his body: he desyred that a com¦pany of soudyours of the romayns myght be graunted and assigned to hym. But Metellus extremely denyed bothe his peticions saynge for the first: that suche honour longed onely to them whome the romayns toke and named for kynges. And also for ye seconde peticion he sayd that it were an vnauy∣sed and iniurious ordināce if the romayne soudyours were gyuen or assigned to the garde and seruice of a Numidyan / whiche was no kyng but a soudyour lyke many mo hyred for stypende. Whyle Gauda was displeased and angry with Me¦tellus for denyeng of these his peticions: Marius came to hym and prouoked hym to reuenge the displeasure & iniury which the captayne had done to hym with his helpe & auaun∣cemēt. This Gauda (as I haue sayd before) was of feble and vnstable mynde: and the mennes wytte was of lytell valoure by meanes of diseases which long had holden hym. Wherfore Marius with his elegant / fayre / and flateryng wordes at his owne pleasure induced hym & exalted his mynde sayeng that he was a kyng an excellent and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy & noble kyng Massinissa. Wherfore (sayd he) yf Iugurth were outher slayne or taken prisoner it wer licke∣ly to cōe to that poynt: that the kyngdome of Numidy shulde be assigned & cōmytted to hym of the senatours without any tary or resystence: whiche thyng shulde shortely be brought to passe yf Marius hymselfe were creat consull in place of Me∣tellus & than assigned to execute and finysshe the warre with Iugurth. Vnder this maner Marius counselled and indu∣ced bothe the sayd Gauda / the romayne knyghtes / the cōmen soudyours / and also the marchauntes and occupyers whiche were in the towne at that season wt many other whome he im∣pelled with his wordes so: that some of them for loue whiche they had to Marius: And other some for great hope and de∣syre which they had to haue peace and cōcorde wrote to Rome to their kynsmen & frendes of the batayle of Numidy & that very sharpely agaynst Metellus desyring & besechyng them to labour at Rome withall their myght that Marius myght be elect consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy. And thus at Rome was the consulshyp desyred by many men with great fauour and very honest peticions for Marius. Also at that tyme had the sayd Marius this auauntage. For the cōmentie at that season deposed many of the states: & eralted such as were newe gentylmen after the lawe of one na¦med Manlius which before had ben {pro}tectour of the cōmētie.
This Manlius ordeyned & inacted a lawe / that if any thyng were vngoodly done and agaynst ryght of the states beynge in any office or dignite: than he whiche so had done shulde be deposed of his office: and in his place some newe gentyll or actyue man of the cōmentie sette and deputed and so exalted. This lawe at those dayes was kept in effect and executed at Rome: wherfore euery thyng proceded prosperously to the purpose & profet of Marius. For (as I haue sayd before) in hym was no noblenesse of auncient lynage nor byrthe. ¶But here wyll I leaue to speke of the ambicion of Marius and retourne to wryte of Iugurth: and howe he behaued hymselfe agaynst Metellus. ¶Howe Iugurth renewed the warre agaynste Metellus / and how the numidyans inhabyters of the towne of Vacca by treason murdred the garnyson of romayns whiche Metellus had set in the same towne. ¶The .xl. chapyter. IN the meane tyme whan Iugurth had broken the cōposicion which he had befo∣re made with Metellus by coūsell of Bomil∣char / and had cōcluded agayne to begyne the warre: than anone he prepared all thyng{is} ne∣cessary to warre with great diligence. And wt great hast he assēbled an army. Moreouer he dayly troubled with thretnynges / or feare / or els with great rewardes: suche citees & townes as befor had forsaken hym & yelded themselfe to Metellus. So that he spared no polycie to make them to render themselfe agayne to hym. In such holdes & townes as were in his possession: he set garnyson and defence of men of warre. He renewed & bought agayne armour & wepyn / and all other thyng{is} which he had lost before: or delyuerd to Me∣tellus in hope of peace. He attysed vnto hym many of the ro∣mayns subgettes & bondemen: by promisyng to them their li∣bertie. He also proued & attempted wt rewardes them: whome Metellus had set & assigned in garnyson / garde and defence of such places as he had wonne in Numidy: so that vtterly be suffred nothyng to be left quyet nor vnassayed: but by all ma∣ner meanes made prouysion for hymselfe mouyng & puttyng in profe euery thynge. But amonge all other thinhabitantes of the cite called Vacca (in whiche Metellus at begynynge had set his garnison: whan Iugurth first sought his peace of
Metellus) were desyred often of Iugurth and with great & importune instance exited to treason. In somoche that at last they assented to hym to cōspire agaynst the romayns. Thin∣habitantes of the cite dyd nat yelde themselfe from Iugurth with their owne goodwyll: and namely thestates and rulers therof dyd neuer yelde them to Metellus saue faynedly. Wherfore specially they were the first that conspired agaynst hym secretely amonge themselfe. For why as it often happe∣ned the commentie and specially of the Numidiens were vn∣stable of mynde / vtterly enclined to sedicion and discorde co∣uetous of newe thynges and changes: and contrary to rest and quyetnesse. But (as I haue sayd before) whan the chyfe of this cite had secretly concluded and apoynted their mater and treason amonge themselfe: agaynst the thyrde day they ordayned that the same thyrde day nexte after shulde be com∣maunded solem / holy / and worshypped ouer all the countrey of Affrike / and Numidy. Whiche day shewed and pretended by all similytude myrth / game / and sport: rather than any drede to the romayns whiche were in garde and gernison of the cyte. But the Numidyens full of prodicion and treason whan they sawe their tyme called vnto their houses all the chefe captayns and maister soudyours of the romayns whi∣che were in the towne. And also one named Turpilius: whome Metellus had ordayned to be his lyeutenant / prouost and chife capitayne of the towne: they enuited and called as yf it had ben to chere and feest them / one to one house / an other to an other. But this there was suche as the Scorpyon is wont to make: whiche whyle she maketh glad semblant with her mouthe mortally styngeth with the tayle: so this feest was a cloke to mortall treason. For whyle the romayns were in myddes of their daynties vnarmed suspectynge no paryll. All the Numidiens at a tokens gyuen and at one hou∣re apoynted before / slewe eche one his geest whiche dyned with hym without fauoure: so that amonge them all escaped nat one / except the sayd Turpilius heed capitayne or lyeute∣nant of the towne. This done: all the Numidyens togyder set vpon the remenant of the cōmen soudyours whiche wan∣dred and strayed abrode in the towne & in the stretes / disper∣sed abrode without any armour: as is wont on suche a day without order / feryng nor doutyng no daunger. Some of the cōmens whan thestates had made them pryue of this treason came also to helpe them / and some other ignorant of the mater sauyng that / that they had desyre and pleasure in suche mur∣der inuaded the romayns also. For though they were igno∣rant of the counsell of this dede: yet the noyse or skirmysshe
and newelty of the mater pleased them ynough. The romayn soudyours were ignorant and incertayne of this vnprouided feare and cruell murder doutynge what was best to be done. Their ennemies cōpasynge them on euery syde letted them to go to the castell of the towne where their armoure and wepyn was: and the gates of the towne were shet on euery syde befo∣re this skyrmysshe began / wherby they were prohibyted to auoyde the towne. Moreouer women & children thrue downe vpon them stones / and other thynges that came next to hande from the wyndowes & hyest partes of their houses: stryuyng who myght throwe first & most. Thus this doutfull and vn∣prouided mychefe coude nat be eschued: nor they which were ryght worthy & strong soudyours were nat able to resyst the very cowardyse and feblenes of women and chyldren / whiche thrue downe vpon them. Thus both good and yll / worthy / & vnworthy / strong / & feble: were all slayne without difference. In this so great ieopardy: the Numidyens beyng mad and cruell in murdre / and the gates shette on euery syde: of all the romayns / or Italyens: onely Turpilius the captayne esca∣ped without hurt of his body. Whyther it so happed by the fa∣uour of his hoost whiche called hym to banket: or by some a∣poyntment of treason: or els by some other chance: it was nat knowen for certayn. But this was knowen that euer after as long as he lyued he was reputed for a vyle and a wretched co∣warde & without credēce▪ bycause that in so great losse & mys∣chefe he coūted it better to escape: and after to lyue / and dye in shame and rebuke: than manly to haue dyed in defence of the towne. And euer after to haue had an honorable name of a worthy capitayne. ¶How Metellus destroyed the towne of Vacca and slewe all the inhabitauntes / in reuengynge their treason. And howe Tupilius lyeutenaunt or captayne of towne / was beheded at commaū∣dement of Metellus. ¶The .xli. chap. WHan Metellus vnderstode of this la∣mentable chance / & treason downe at the towne of Vacca: his mynde was meruaylously gre∣ued / abasshed / & sadde withall. But to thintent that none shulde parceyue his heuynesse / he withdrue hymselfe frome company a lytell tyme: but after whan he had satisfied his mynde with teares / and secrete la∣mentacion. And whan his dolour was myxed with wrath
and displeasure agaynst that cruell dede: than hasted he hym∣selfe with great cure & diligence to go reuenge this iniurious and cruell treason. Anone he called forth a legion of soudyors whiche passed forthe the wynter with hym: and with them al∣so as many horsmen of the Numidyens as he myght assem∣ble whiche had forsaken Iugurth and fled to hym: whome he thought most trusty. His legion he arayed in lyght harnesse and easy armour to thintēt to spede the way more redely. And by cause he entended to go about this mater secretly: therfore priuely euyn with the sonne goyng downe / he toke his iour∣nay & {pro}ceded forwarde towarde Vacca: and laboured so that on the next day after about the thyrde houre he came with his cōpany into a certayne playne a lytell closed or cōpased about with small downys nat moch hyer than the extremitees of the valey. There called he togyder his soudyours whiche were wery for the great labour of their iourney: and longe way which they had gone. Insomoch that they refusyd to procede any farther. But Metellus conforted them sayeng that the towne of Vacca was no more but one myle thens. Wherfore he desyred them to suffre & endure the remenāt of their labour with pacyent myndes / but onely tyll reuenged the deth of the citezins & their felowes which were strong & worthy men: and very miserably murdred. Moreouer he shewed to them beny∣gnely the great pray which was redy for them / if they wolde manly {pro}cede. Thus were their myndes exalted / cōforted / and enbolded with his wordes. Metellus seynst that: was glad & anone cōmaunded the horsmen to {pro}cede in the forward these horsmen were numidyens. And the fotemen he cōmaunded to kepe secrete their standerdes / conysances / and badges: and to go behynde vnder the shadowe of the horsemen as nere togy∣der as they myght: and so proceded he towarde the towne. ¶Whan the citezyns sawe an army approche and moue to∣warde them: at the begynnynge they thought it had ben Me∣tellus (as it was in dede) and onone shytte the gates of the towne agaynst hym. But afterwarde whan they aduysed them well: and sawe that the company which approched ma∣de no deuastacion nor distruction by the feldes nor countrey as they went. And also whā they parceyued that the horsmen whiche were in the forwarde were Numidyens: agayne they thought that it was Iugurth with his company. Wherfore with great ioy they issued forthe of the towne to mete hym. Metellus anone parceyued their ignorance and gaue a token to his people to assayle them. The horsmen and fotemen kno∣wynge the wyll of their captayne by blast of the trūpettes as∣sayled and ouerthrue the cōmentie which came out of the cite
agaynst them dis{per}sed ouer the feldes. Some of the romains ran to the gates of the towne & entred without resistence: and some toke & inuaded the towres of the walles maugre the ke∣pars. Thus the dispeasure & yre whiche the romayns had for deth of their felowes: & the hope of prayes of the towne ouer∣came & excluded their werynes which they had in their iour∣nay thyderwarde. Thus the inhabitantes of Vacca enioyed their treason but onely two dayes. For onely the space of two dayes cōtinued their falshode & crueltie vnreuenged. For that great & riche cyte was all gyuen to hauocke & murdre vtter∣ly distroyed of the romayns: so that no creature escaped alyue to boost of their treason before cōmitted agaynst the romains whome they had so trayterously slayne within their cite. Turpilius lyetenant or captayne of the towne whiche (as I haue sayd before) escaped onely with his lyfe: was called befo¦re Metellus and cōmaunded to answere for hymselfe by what way or meanes he escaped / whyther by treason done to the towne / or by any other policy. But bycause he coude but sim∣ply excuse nor pourge hymselfe of that whiche was layed agaynst hym / he first was scourged & beaten: and after that his heed stryken of from his sholders / for that it was thought that if he had nat betrayed the cite he coude nat haue escaped more than any other. Farthermore that great dystruction of the romains was ascribed to his negligēce or treason. If this Turpilius had ben a romayn he shulde nat haue put to deth. For the lawe of Porcius prohibyted any citezine of Rome to be slayne: but if they cōmytted any great offence / the extreme punysshement by the lawe was to cōmyt them to exyle. But this Turpilius inioyed nat the priuyleges of this lawe: for asmoche as he was no citezyne of Rome / but an Italyan of the towne of Collace. ¶Howe Bomylchar conspyred treason agaynst Iugurth and by what meanes this treason was discouered and Bomilchar with certayne other put to deth for the same. ¶The .xlii. chap. AT the same tyme Bomilchar (by whose counsell and mocyon Iugurth before had begon the cōposicion with Metellus / which he omitted and brake agayn for feare) was cōuersant with Iugurth / whiche alytell suspected this Bomil∣char of treason. Wherfore he suspectyng hym agayne ymagy∣ned newe policy agaynst Iugurth dayly sekynge & deuysing
some gyle to his dystruction and deth / so that in dyuerse de∣uyses there about his mynde wandred and was weryed both day & nyght. But whan he had assayed many wayes and that nothing came to purpose: he adioyned vnto hym an other cō∣panyon named Nabdalsa / a noble man exalted & enhaunced with great rychesse: and moche beloued of his cōmentie and people of whome he had rule. This Nabdalsa was so well beloued with Iugurth / that often tymes he cōmytted to hym an army & power by hymselfe to execute all other thyng{is} whi∣che longed to meane besynesse whyle Iugurth hymselfe was weryed or lette with other gretter thynges: wherby the sayd Nabdalsa had optayned great honour & gathered great ry∣chesse. Thus at cōclusion: by apoyntemēt & counsell bothe of Bomilchar & of Nabdalsa a day was prefixed betwene them to execute their treason agaynst Iugurth. And in the meane tyme they {pro}uyded euery thyng to that purpose as the matter and case requyred. This apoyntmēt made: they bothe depar∣ted in sonder. Nabdalsa went to the army whiche Iugurth had cōmytted to hym for to tary with the same nere to those places where the romayns wyntred: to thintent that if the ro∣mayns wasted or distroyed the coūtrey. Nabdalsa with his cōpany shulde other prohibet them: or els so dystourbe them that they shulde nat escape vnreuenged. But whan the tyme apoynted drewe nere: than was Nabdalsa so abasshed for the gretnesse of the dede that he mette nat with Bomilchar at the day & tyme assigned. This his great feare letted all the mater. But whā Bomilchar was thus disapoynted of his partyng felowe he was greatly abasshed: neuerthelesse his mynde was moch desyrous to perfourme his enterprise. But agayne he was doutfull for this cowardouse fere of his cōpanyon: lest he wolde omytte their first apoyntment and counsell / and be∣gyn some other newe apoyntmēt. Wherfore he sē letters vn∣to hym by trusty frendes / and partyners of the same treason. In which letters he sharpely blamed the pacyence / delayeng / and cowardyse of Nabdalsa / and vnstablenesse of his mynde obtestyng and callyng vnto wytnes the goddes by whome he had sworne to {per}fourme the sayd treason. Moreouer he war∣ned hym that he sholde nat tourne to their dystruction and cō¦fusyon: the great rewardes whiche they bothe myght haue of Metellus. Which thyng truly shuld fortune if Metellus hym selfe shulde bring Iugurth into captiuyte. Farthermore Bo¦mylchar in the same letters gaue monicion to Nabdalsa that thende of Iugurth was nere come: and that it was nat possy∣ble that he might long contynewe all thynges cōsydred. But than was the mater in hande whyther he shulde be destroyed
by them or els by Metellus. Wherfore he exhorted hym well to consyder in mynde whyther he had leuer betray hym / and therby optayne great fauour and rewardes: or els to leaue of tyll Metellus ouercame hym: and than to be put to deth also with hym. ¶These exhortacions with other lyke were contayned in the letters of Bomilchar dyrected vnto Nabdalsa. But whan these letters were delyuerd: as chaunce was: Nabdalsa lay on his bed to recreate and refresshe his body weryed with la∣bour and besynesse / which he had taken before. Whan Nab∣dalsa had red these letters and vnderstode the mynde of Bo∣milchar: first many deuyses entred his mynde and moch cu∣re he had in musyng what was moost expedient to be done in the cause. But whyle he was in this study: sodenly he fell in a slombre and his wery membres desyring rest moued hym to fall in slepe. This Nabdalsa had a seruant longynge to hym whome he moche loued and trusted: in somoche that no besy∣nesse nor coūsell he hydd nor kept secret from hym: this coun∣sell of betrayng of Iugurth onely except. Whan this seruant vnderstode that the sayd letters were brought to his lorde he thought that he had nede of his counsell as he was wont and acustomed to haue in other maters: and anone entred in to the tent where his maister lay. And seyng hym fast in slepe he toke the letters whiche Nabdalsa had vnwysely layd aboue his heed vpon the pyllowe: and seyng by the superscripcion that the letter came from Bomilchar he redd it to thende. But whan he vnderstode the treason: in all hast he addressed hym with the same letter to Iugurth. Nabdalsa nat longe after awakenyd and myssed the letter / wherfore anone he enquy∣red who had ben there in his tent. But in short season came dyuers of his louers from Iugurth / which certifyed hym of all the mater as it was done. Nabdalsa first of all entended to pursue his accuser: but whan he perceyued that it was but in vayne so to do / consydring that he was all redy in the compa∣ny of Iugurth: he went vnto Iugurth hymselfe to thintent to pacify and mytigate his displeasure & wrath. And sayd vnto hym that whan the sayd letters were first delyuerd vnto hym he had fully purposed nat to kepe them secret: but hymselfe to haue disclosed them to Iugurth. But whyle he was slepyng his false seruant (in hope to be aduansed therby) had preuen∣ted hym his purpose & done the same thyng which he himselfe had fully purposed to do. Farthermore wepyng he besought & required hym for all amyte and loue whiche had ben bytwene them & for all the faythfull seruice whiche he had done to hym in foretyme nat to haue hym suspected in so cruell a dede. Iu∣gurth
answered to these requestes of Nabdalsa myldly & so∣berly lest any gretter variance myght ryse therof: but moche cōtrary to the disposicion of his mynd. For he thought other∣wyse than he answered: howe beit he had well refrayned and alayed his wrath before wt the deth of Bomilchar / & of many other whome he knewe first deuisours & partynge felowes of that treason whome he had caused to be put to deth before the cōmyng of Nabdalsa: lest some batayle or other insurrection shuld haue {pro}ceded of ye besinesse if they had lyued any lenger. ¶From this day forwarde Iugurth was neuer quyet day nor nyght: so that he trusted nouther place / nother man / nor tyme: but suspected & mystrusted euery thyng. His ennemies and his owne subgettes he dreded and suspected both in lyke & after one maner. He sherched & espyed euery place for drede of treason doutyng & suspectyng euery sound or noyse that he herde. He rested and lay some nyght in one place and some nyght in an other / and that in abiect & secrete places agaynst the honoure of his estate royall. Somtyme he rose from his bed in his slepe in myddes of the nyght and armed hymselfe cryng / enragyng / and violently smyting agaynst the walles of the chambre: as if he had ben in batayle. So that for the great drede of treason whiche he had / he toke no rest nother slepyng nor wakyng: but was violently vexed and fered lyke a mad man without reason or discression. ¶How Metellus renued the warre agaynst Iu¦gurth: and howe Marius was creat consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy at plea¦sure of the cōmens agaynst the wyll of all the no¦ble men of Rome. ¶The .xliii. chapyter. WHan Metellus by such as fled bitwene the two parties vnderstode of the chance of Bo∣milchar and of this treason disclosed / he began than agayne to cōtende wt Iugurth: with open warre and therto hasted all thyng necessary and expedient. And considryng that Marius was cōtinually cry∣eng on hym for the sayd licence and congy to depart to Rome and also greuous / hatefull / and contrary to hym: aduysynge hym nat moche necessary but lytell mete ī so sharpe a besynes. And seyng hym yll wyllyng to euery thyng he graunted hym lycēce at last: to departe toward Rome as he before had often requyred and demaunded by peticion.
¶But as I haue sayd longe before / the letters whiche were sende to Rome to the cōmens by fauourers of Marius were well accepted. For whan the cōmentie had ouersene them / and by them vnderstode the praysyng of Marius / & the dispray∣syng of Metellus. They were all inclined vtterly to the auaū∣cemēt of Marius & detraccion of the other. The noblenes of Metellus the capitayne whiche was before to his great wor∣shyp & honour tourned nowe to enuy & hatered agaynst hym. But the lownes & vnnoblenes of Marius encreased to hym fauour specially of the cōmentie which were come of vnnoble blode / as he was. But the diligence & fauour of both the par∣ties (that is to say of thestates which helde with Metellus: & of the cōmens that helde with Marius) dyd measure & gyde euery thynge rather than the good or yll disposicions of the two aduersaryes Metellus or Marius. For the commens to dy for it / concluded to exalte Marius. And the estates in the same maner laboured to kepe hym vnder bycause he was vn∣noble borne / and to exalte none saue them which were come of noble progeny. Farthermore the maisters and heed officers of the cōmentie which loued debate at euery assemble and cō∣gregacion of the cōmenssore blamed Metellus and dispised his dedes desyring of the cōmens that Metellus might be put to the punysshe of his heed / sayng that he was so worthy: for that he {pro}longed the warr in Numidy agaynst Iugurth mo∣re than nede was. But in dispisyng and accusyng Metellus they forgat nat to cōmende Marius / and exalt hym with wor¦des som what to moche: and more than he was worthy in ma∣ny poyntes. In somoche that the people were so greatly encly¦ned to hym with their fauoure: that all the crafty men and la∣bourers of the cite: and also of the countrey whiche had no ly∣uyng saue in the labour of their handes left their warke and bsynesse and folowed Marius / frequentyng and resortyng to his company. And sette more by his auauncement and ho∣nour than by their owne profet or aduauntage / trustyng that after yf he optayned the sayd honoure: they shulde haue their lyuenge by hym. And thus shortly to speke the estates and no∣ble men of Rome beynge sore astonyed / the consulshyp was cōmytted to Marius a newe gentylmen whose predecessours before hym to such dignite coude neuer attayne & were coun∣ted vnworthy. Thus that thynge whiche many yeres before that tyme coude neuer be done nor brought about: was nowe brought to effect: that is to say the consulshyp which was the most excellent dignite of Rome was nowe in handes of the commentie & cōmytted to a man of basse byrth. Shortly after this: the protectour of the cōmentie named Lucius Manlius
enquyred & demaunded of the people whome it wolde please them to sende into Numidy to finysshe the warre with Iu∣gurgth. The most part of the cōmentie answered that Ma∣rius shulde haue that office & besynesse: how beit a lytell befo∣re that tyme the senatours had assigned by their ordinaunce the prouince of Numidy to Metellus for his worthy dedes: wherfore nowe this ordinaunce was frustrate & voyde. For the cōmentie wolde haue their statutes executed & fulfylled. ¶Of the seconde batell foughten bytwene Me∣tellus and Iugurth: and howe Iugurth lost the batayle and also one of his chiefe townes named Thala. ¶The .xliiii. chapyter. IN the meane tyme whyle the interpri∣se of Marius proceded thus forwarde at Rome: Iugurth was sore troubled ī his mynde for ma∣ny cōsideracions. First he consydred the losse of many whome he reputed for his frendes tyll be∣fore he knewe their treason of whom he had many put to deth and many other had fled from hym for feare / some to the ro∣mayns / and other some to Bocchus kynge of the mauriens. He called also to his mynde that without ministers an men of warre he was nat able to execute the warre: and more ouer he thought it ieopardous after so great falshode and treason of his olde fendes to proue or assay the fidelite of newe. For these causes and mo lyke (as I haue sayd before) his mynde was driuen to and fro / variable & incertayne in diuers opy∣nions. Insomoch that there was no maner thyng / no coūsell nor no maner man: that coude sufficiently satisfy nor please his mynde. He changed his iournayes and wayes euery day into sondry places for feare of treson. Somtyme he addressed hym towarde his ennemies: and anone after retourned into wodes & wyldernesses. Often tymes he had trust & cōfidence in flyght: and anone after put his trust in armour & batayle. He douted whyther he myght lesse trust to strength or trueth of his men which were with hym: so that what euer he purpo∣sed to do: or whyther so euer he intended / euery thynge was cōtrary to hym. But whyle Iugurth thus prolonged and ta∣ryed: sodenly Metellus with his army appered in his syght. Iugurth that parceyuyng: set in order and array his numi∣dyēs aswell as he might aft the short tyme which he had ther∣to. And immidyatly the armyes approched: and the batayle began. In that part of the batayle where Iugurth hymselfe
was: they stroue and resysted a lytell space: but all the other numidyens at the first brunt / concourse or assaut were put to flyght with violence / and driuen backwarde. The romayns toke some of their standerdes and armour / which they fleyng away left behynde them: but of their ennemies they toke but fewe. For the Numidiens in that batayle and almoost in all other defended themselfe better with their fete: thā with their handes or armoure. Iugurth at this tyme: mystrusted his case moche more than at any other tyme euer before / for the cowardous withdrawyng of his people. Wherfore he acōpa∣nyed hymselfe with the romayns which had forsaken and be∣trayed Metellus / & fled to hym. With them / and with a part of his horsmen he fled into the wyldernesses therby: and from thens vnto a towne named Thala / which was a great towne & a rich: and moch of his treasour & of the aparell longyng to the yongth of his yong chyldren was in the same towne. But whan Metellus vnderstode that Iugurth was fled to so ryche a towne / how beit he knewe that bytwene the towne and the next flod therto was .l. mylespace of dry groūd voyde & without habitacion: neuerthelesse he toke in hande to ouer∣come all sharpnesse and difficultie of places: and also to ouer∣come nature / though it semed impossible to mannes mynde. This thynge Metellus toke in hande in hope to fynisshe the batayle moche soner yf he myght wynne that towne. ¶Wherfore he cōmaunded that all the beestes whiche serued for cariage / shulde be vnladen of all suche baggage and bur∣thens as they caried longynge to the soudyours: saue onely whete and vitayle for the space of .x. dayes. Also he cōmaūded some of the beestes to be laded with bottels full of water / and other vessels mete to be caryed with water. Moreouer: ouer all the contrey he gathered togyder as many tame beestes as he coude get and them laded with empty vessels of euery sort. Many of them were treen vessell which he had done to be ga∣thered among the villages of the Numidiens. Farthermore he cōmaunded thinhabitantes of those marches whiche after the flight of Iugurth had yelded them to hym that they shuld make them redy to folowe the hoost euery man with asmoche water as they myght beare. And assigned them a daye and place / where they shulde be redy vnder payne of dethe. Whan Metellus was come to the sayd flod whiche was fyfty myle from the towne of Thala and nerest water therto (as I haue sayd before) he dyd all the beestes to be laded of the sa∣me water. And so went towarde Thala / his hoost set in order and aray: so that yf any ieopardy apered he was euer redy at defēce / but afterwarde whan he was come to that place where
he had apoynted the numidiens to mete hym with the water wherwith they were laded and folowed the hoost. And whan his tentes were pytched / sette / and defended about with tren∣ches / cutte trees / bowes / and stakes after the policy of warre: sodenly from the heuen descended great violence and plenty of rayne water that it was more than sufficiently to all the ar∣my aswel to men as beestes. Moreouer their vitels were mo∣re plētyfull than they trusted or loked after. For the numidiēs which newly were yelded were somoche the more seruisable and redy to mynistre euery thynge necessary vnto the army. And no maruell: for euery thyng is quycke at the begynnyng which often fadeth at the ende. But the soudyours and men of warre: wer more glad to ocupy the rayne water for deuocion / than suche water whiche was brought vnto them in vessels by caryage. For they supposed that their goddes loued and fauoured them whiche in so drye a countrey / and in suche a chaūce sent to them so great plenty of water besyde prouision of ther captayne. This thyng greatly conforted the myndes of them all: and incouraged them with boldnesse / strength / & diligence: to ouercome all difficulties whiche remayned. This confort kyndlyng their myndes: they spedde themselfe so forwarde that on the next day aft they came vnto the towne of Thala: cōtrary vnto the opinion or knoledge of Iugurth. Thinhabitantes which thought themselfe surely defended by the sharpnesse and difficultie of the place / were sodenly abas∣shed & astonyed for that great vnwont and vnprouided case. Neuerthelesse they made prouision to batayle as quyckely as they myght by sufferaūce of the tyme. The romayns addres∣sed them in the same maner. But the kynge Iugurth anone cast in his mynde that to Metellus was nothing vnprouided nor vnable to be done: as he that by his craft / diligence / and polycie: had ouercome both wepen / armour / place / and tyme. And also nature itselfe: whiche ruleth other thynges longyng vnto men. Iugurth this aduysing & reuoluyng in his mynde fled priuely by nyght forth of the towne with his children and a great part of his treasour. Nor after this tyme he neuer ta∣ryed in one place past the space of a daye or of one nyght fay∣nyng that he fled so from one place to an other bycause of his present besynesse: but the ryght cause of his remouynge was for that he feared treason which he thought best to auoyd and eschue by continuall chaungyng of places. For suche counsels of treason can nat be taken without deliberacion and processe of tyme / and conueniens or oportunyte of places where prin∣ces dothe long so iourne and continue. ¶But whan Metellus sawe that thinhabitantes were redy
to batayle / and also that the towne was strongly defended bo∣the by crafte of mannes handes and by nature of the place. Anone he compased about the towne on euery syde with pro∣founde dychesse / trenches / and herdels: of sharpe stakes the poyntes vpwarde to thentent that none of thinhabytantes shuld breke out nor escape by night / as Iugurth had done be∣fore: nor that no vitels shulde be conuayed into them / wherby they myght the lengar resyst hym and indure the sege. After∣warde he cōmaunded scaffoldes to be made about the walles specially in suche places as were moost conuenient: and pen∣tyses of sheldes conioyned in maner of vynes to be driuen to the walles vpon wheles. And aboue the sayd scaffoldes to be cast a hepe of grauell and stones: and toures of tymbre and bulwarkes set vpon them: and other soudyours he assigned to defende the warke / and them also that laboured therevpon. These scaffoldes / pentyses / and pauases: were made to then∣tent that vnder them the romayns might vndermine the wal∣les without great paryll or dammage. On the othersyde / the garnyson and inhabitantes hastely laboured to resyst the ro∣mayns & to defende themselfe and their towne manfully. So that on bothe parties was nothyng forgoten / able to be done touchyng their defence. But brefely to speke the romayns we∣ryed with moch labour and batayle .xl. dayes after they were cōe thyder: at last wan the towne. But all the pray and riches of the towne was distroyed by them whiche were within the towne in garnyson: of the romayns / whiche had fled from Metellus to Iugurth: which specially had assigned them to defende the towne. These traytours whan they sawe the wal∣les vndermined & brused with diuerse ingens of batayle: and their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours nor hope remayned. Than they assembled & caried togyder all the treasour & riches of the towne / as golde / syluer / with other precious ornamentes or iewels into the palays of Iugurth / & there fylled themselfe with wyne and other delycate meates. And at cōclusion whan they were full saturate and ingorged: they sette fyre on the palays and wylfully brent and distroyed the richesse / the palays / and themselfe withall. So that suche punysshement as they dreded to suffre of their ennemies they voluntarily suffred the same with their owne hādes to auoyd the subieccion and daunger of their ennemies: by desperate folly and presumptuous madnesse. ¶How Metellus fortified the cite of Leptis and at request of the embassadours of the same cytie
sende thyder garnyson to defēde the cyte agaynst Iugurth: and of the sytuacion of the same cyte & behauour of thīhabytant{is} therof. The .xlv. cha. AT the same tyme whanne Thala was wonne of the romayns / embassadors cāe frō a towne of Numidy named Leptis vnto Metellus / requirynge hym to sende thyder socours of garnison & a capitayne to defende them from the oppression and iniu∣ry of a certayne noble and debatefull man / which was within that cyte named Amylchar which (as they sayd) cōtinually laboured for newe chang{is} excityng and mo∣uyng the cōmen people to forsake the romayns agayne. In so moch that agaynst the sayd Amylchar no man was able to re∣syst nor to preuayle: for he set nought by cōmaūdemēt of their officers and rulers / nor yet by the auncient lawes of their cite At cōclusion these embassadors sayd to Metellus for a surete that except he graunted their peticion that bothe their owne helthe / and also the frendes & louers of thempire whiche were within that cite shulde be in great danger and paryll. ¶These Leptitans at begynnyng of this warre of Iugurth requyred frendshyppe with the romayns of Calphurnius of whome is made mencion in begynnyng of this hystorie. And after that they sende to Rome vnto all the senatours requy∣ryng the same amyte and peace to be confermed of them: whi∣che thynge was graunted to them gladly. Therfore from thenfforth they euer contynued good and faythfull to the ro∣mayns: and worthely and substācially dyd euery thyng whi∣che was cōmaunded vnto them by Calphurnius / by Albinus or by Metellus. For this consyderacion they lyghtly optay∣ned all their desyre of Metellus / whiche at their request sent forth with them vnto the sayd towne of Leptis: foure cohor∣tes of lombardes chosen out of all his army with whome he sent to be captayne ouer them a noble knyght of his army na∣med Caius Annius / whome he also assigned to be lyeutenant of the towne. ¶This towne of Leptis was buylded first of all by the Si∣donians which (as we rede) fled from their owne contrey for discorde and variance which fell among their cities at home. Which Sidonians came in shyppes into the coostes of Affri¦ke: where at last they buylded this cite of Leptes / which is si∣tuate bytwene two quickesandes of whome the cite hath his name.
¶For about thextreme partes of Affrike be .ii. breckes of the see nere togyder nat lyke of quantite: but lyke of nature. Of which two breekes those partes which be nerest vnto the land ar very profounde and depe with hye bankes of sande on eue∣ry syde. But the other places nat nere vnto the lande be som∣tyme depe: somtyme shalowe after the dysposytion of the we∣ther. For whan the see begynneth in ragyng to be great and tempestyous by mouynge of the wynde than the waues of ye see draweth forth of the same places the slyme / grauell / and great stones: which in cawine wether were gathered togyder before in the same places. And thus the facyon / aspecte / and regarde of the same places is mutable and changed at euery tempest and great wynde. ¶The langage of the cite of Leptis is nowe chaunged from the langage of Sydom into numidian langage / by mariag{is} of the numidians. But their lawes / their apparell / and ma∣ners (for the most part) styll foloweth the custome of sydoni / which they mētayned & kept styll: somoche the more easely: by¦cause they dwelled seperat in the extreme and vtter partes of the countrey farre from the court & frequentacion of kynges of numidy. For bytwene this cyte of Leptis and the wele in∣habited partes of numidy be many places deserte and wyd wyldernesses vnhabyted for drienes of the contrey. ¶The discripcion of that place of Affrike which is named the Phelen auters: and for what cause the sāe place was first so named. The .xlvi. cha. BVt for asmoche as by occasyon of this besynes of the cyte of Lept{is} and their embassadours / I haue made mencyon of their cyte and partly discrybed the sytuaci∣on of ye same. Nowe me thynketh it thyng conuenient / and nat vnworthy to recount an excellent and meruaylous dede done in the same coostes by two brethern borne of the cite of Cartha∣ge and namely bycause the place is called the Phylene auters me thynketh it requisyte to declare the cause of that denomi∣nacion. For this place of our hystorie so requireth. ¶What tyme the Carthaginēses had in possession and were lordes ouer the moost part of Affryke: at the same season the Cirenenses also were great and famous of name: and abun∣dant of welth and richesse. Than betwene the coostes of these two cities was a great & large felde all ouer spred with sande without diuision / perticion / or difference. But bytwene them
was neyther fod nor mountayne / whiche myght discerne the boundes & marches of bothe their coostes: which thyng cau∣sed cōtinuall & longe warre often and great batayls bytwene both parties. But after that many armies on both sydes wer ouercome / slayne / or put to flyght both by lande & by see and whan both peoples had somwhat wasted the one the other by spoylyng & murdre: than began they to perceyue their owne foly on both partes feryng lest some other nacion anone after shuld assayle them both the ouercomers and them that were ouercome whan they were wasted & weryed with batayls and brought to extremite: Wherfore this cōsydred: they toke truys bytwene them bothe & to auoyed that long variance bytwene them: they made agremēt & cōuenant that messangers or em∣bassadours of bothe parties shulde depart out of their cities at one certayne day and houre assigned. And that same place where the messangers of both the cities shulde mete togyder: shulde be for euer after taken for the boundes and marches of the coūtrey / of both the nacions & cities without more conten∣cion or variance. To bryng this apoyntmēt to effect & conclu¦syon forth of the cite of Cyren were chosen two for their part and sende forth at the day & houre apoynted. And in lykewyse out of Carthage were send two breterne / eche of them named Phylene which swyftly sped them in their iourney. But the Cyrenēses went moch more slowly whether it so fortuned by negligēce or chaūche I knowe but lytell the trueth. But this is knowen for certayne that about those coostes tempeste of wynde & weder is wont to let men and {pro}long their iourney in lykewyse as vpon the see: and that for this cause. For whan by those euyn places wyde / & bare wtout any thing growynge on them: the wynde ryseth & styreth the small sande from the groūde: the same sande moued by great violence of the wynd is wont to fyll the faces / mouthes and eyen of such as passeth that way with dust & sande. And thus often by lettyng of their syght: their iournay is {pro}longed & hyndred. But after whan the Cyrenenses sawe themselfe somwhat ouerflowe & late in their iournay: they fered punysshement at their retournynge home for their negligēce. And blamyng they accused the Car∣thaginenses obiectyng & sayeng that they had come forth of their cite before the tyme assigned: and thus they troubled all the mater & brake the ordynance. But shortly to speke these Ci¦renenses cōcluded rather to suffre deth and to do any thynge possible than to retourne home agayn ouercōe. Wherfore the Carthaginenses desyred some other cōdicion or apoyntment to be made indifferēt & equall bytwene both the parties. The Cirenēses cōsented therto & put the Carthaginēses in choyse
whyther they wold be quicke buryed in that same place whi∣che they desyred for their marches and boūdes: or els that the Cirenenses vnder the same cōdicion shulde {pro}cede forwarde to that place whiche they desyred for their marches and there to be quicke buryed vnder the same maner. The .ii. bretherne both named Phylene alowed and graunted the cōdicion sub∣duyng & abandonyng their bodyes to deth for the profet and wele of their contrey & cite of Carthage: and so were they bu∣ryed quicke. Wherfore the Carthaginenses in the same place where they were buryed raysed & halowed .ii. auters in wor∣shyp & remēbrance of these two brethern which set more by en∣crese of their contrey: than by their owne lyues. These auters to this presēt day be called the Phylene auts after the name of the .ii. brethern named Phylenis therunder buryed / as sayd is for wele of their contrey: also besyde this memorial wtin the cite of Carthage were many other thing{is} ordayned to ye gret honour of them & remembrance of their worthy dede. ¶But nowe wyll I leaue this mater & reteurne to my purpose. ¶How Iugurth assembled a newe army of the rude getulyans agaynst the romayns: and how he associated vnto hym Bocchus kynge of the Mauriens to strengthe hym in batayle agaynst Metellus. ¶The .xlvii. chapyter. WHan Iugurth had lost the citie of Tha∣la / one of the strongest cities of his lande (as sayd is before) than he consydred well that in all his kyngdome was no place stronge ynough to re∣syst the myght of Metellus. Wherfore he hasted hym with a small cōpany through desertes and great wylder¦nesse fleyng from his owne contrey. And at last he came to the lande of Getulians whiche is a maner of people rude / wylde / & without order or maners: and at that season nought know∣yng of the preemynēt honour & fame of the romayne empire. Of this people Iugurth assembled a multitude togyder and by lytell & lytell enduced & taught them by custome and exer∣cyse to folowe the order of chyualry: to kepe array / to insue their standerdes / to obey the cōmaundementes of their capi∣tayns / to discerne and haue knowlege of the signifiaunce of soundes of trumpettes: and to obserue all other poyntes be∣longyng to warfare & chyualry. These thyng{is} with otherlike necessary to batayle / Iugurth ceassed nat to prepare and or∣dayne with all diligence.
¶Moreouer he prouoked vnto his fauour and felowshyp by great rewardes & moch gretter promises suche as were most nere frendes to Bocchus kyng of the mauriēs: by whose helpe he hymselfe went to the kyng Bocchus & moche desyred hym in his quarell with hym to warre agaynst the romayns. To this request of Iugurth Bocchus agreed somoch the more for asmoche as at first begynnynge of the same warre: this Boc∣chus sent vnto Rome embassadours to desyre of the romayns amyte and a bonde of cōtinuall peace bytwene hym & them. But nat withstandyng that this peticion & peace was moche expediēt necessary to the romayns for diuerse cōsideracions and namely bycause of this warre. Nat the lesse it was nat graūted by meane of a fewe such as at Rome blynded wt aua∣rice: were wont to sell for money euery thyng both honest and dishonest. Also befor this tyme the doughter of Iugurth was spoused to the sayed Bocchus. But this bonde of frendshyp of affinite among the numidīes / & mauriens: is reputed but of effect: bycause they ar wont euery man to haue diuerse & many wyues acordyng to their substāce & richesse. Some .x. and some mo: after as they ar of abylite or power to mētayne. But the kyng{is} bycause they ar of most power & substāce: ther∣fore haue they mo than an other. Thus is their mynde and fa¦uour distract & diuersly deuyded from all their wyues for the multitude of thē: and bycause they haue so many so that they reserue none for their speciall bed felowe. Wherfore they all ar reputed vyle / & lytell set by: after one maner. Thus the affinite bytwene these two kyng{is} Iugurth & Bocchus / was lytell set by and small thyng auayled in this besynesse. Nat withstan∣dynge both they & their hoostes cāe togyder in a place apoyn∣ted therto: where after that they had gyuen & taken fayth and trueth one to other of fidelite / to be obserued bytwene them Iugurth greatly inhaūced & lyfted vp the mynde of Bocchus with his wordes sayeng that the romains were iniust groun∣ded in auarice without suffisance or measure. And cōmen en∣nemies to euery man and to euery contrey: and that they had asmoch quarell agaynst Bocchus / as agaynst hym. And one selfe cause to warre agaynst them both: and also agaynst ma∣ny other nacions / whiche cause was but onely the pleasure of great lordshyp & riches. So that for the same cause all kyng∣domes to thē were aduers & cōtrary / and that he hymselfe to them was enmy for the same cause. And nat longe before that tyme the Carthaginēses: and aftwarde Perses kyng of Ma¦cedony were subdued & vndone by the romayns without any iust tytle or cause of batyle: saue onely ambicion & enuy whi¦che the romayns had agaynst them. And that in tyme to come
euery nacyon whiche shulde haue welth and richesse shuld be∣come ennemies to the romayns for their inordynat pride / & in saciable couetyse. ¶With these wordes and otherlyke Iugurth moued the mynde of Bocchus agaynst the romayns. In somoche that anone a day was apoynted bytwene bothe the kynges to pro∣cede forth togyder to the towne of Cyrtha / and to assayle the same with both their powers conioyned. This towne they purposed first of all to besige: bycause Metellus had left with in the same towne his prayes and prisoners which he had ta∣ken of Iugurth. And also moche of his owne ordynaūce had he left there to a voyde impedyment in his voyage. Thus Iugurth thought most expedient to do. For if the myght wyn the towne by assaut before the rescous of Metellus: he thought that shuld be moost to his honour and profet. Or els yf the romayne capitayne Metellus / and his army shulde come to socours of the towne: than thought he that there both hymselfe and Bocchus shuld gyue batayle to Metellus. Iugurth for craft and subtylte hasted hereto somoche the mo∣re to tangle Bocchus in the warre before any place shulde be moued bytwene hym & the romayns. And lest the same Boc∣chus by prolōgyng of the tyme myght rather encline to peace than to warre after he at leasour shuld haue taken better coū∣sell and aduisement. For Iugurth suspected at begynnynge that Metellus in processe of tyme wolde desyre this Bocchus nat to medyll in this warre assistyng the part of Iugurth nor mentayning his cause. ¶Howe Metellus vsed hymselfe herynge that these two kynges were confederat agaynst hym and how after he was certifyed that the prouyn∣ce of Numidy was assigned to Marius the new consull: he cssed the warre for the nones. ¶The .xlviii. chapyter. WHanne Metellus knewe that the two kynges were associate togyder: he thought nat to fyght with them rasshely without prouisyon: nor in euery place for his aduantage or nat as he was wont to do often tymes before after the first tyme that he had ouercome Iugurth. But within his feldes well and surely defended he kept hymselfe abydinge the com¦mynge of the two kynges: and that nat farre from the towne
of Cirtha. This dyd he thynking it best to know the myght / maners / and cōdicions of the mauriens first or he wold fight with them / bycause they were but newe ennemies and therfo¦re their maners vnknowen to hym. And whan he sawe his best auantage than thought he to gyue them batayle. ¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus taryed the commyng of the two kynges: letters were brought vnto hym from Ro∣me: which certifyed hym that the prouince of Numidy / was cōmytted and gyuen to Marius the newe consull. For he had herde longe before this tyme that the sayd Marius was elect cōsull: but this was the first tyme that he vnderstode the pro∣uince of Numidy cōmitted to hym. For this cause was Me∣tellus moued & displeased moch more than longed to measure or honesty. In somoch that he coud neyther refrayne his eyen from wepyng nor measure his tong from spekyng yll by Ma¦rius. This Metellus was a synguler noble and worthy man in all other condicions: but the displeasure of his mynde he toke ouer womanly & tenderly to his hert / and namely in this cause. Which condicion: some reputed to procede of a proude hert of Metellus. And other some thought it no meruayle though his noble hert were moued and kyndled with anger / for this iniury and wrong done to hym. And many sayd that Metellus toke so great sorowe and displeasure: bycause the victorie which he had almoost optayned shulde be pulled out of his handes his selfe hauyng the labour and paryll / and an other man the tryumphe and honour. But to be playne in the mater and indifferently to write: it was nat vnknowen to the wysest romayns / but that the dignite / auauncement / an ho∣nour of Marius greued Metellus: moch more than dyd his owne iniury. And that he wolde nat haue taken it so heuely if the prouince of Numidy which was taken from hym had ben gyuen to any other noble men thā to Marius. Wherfore Me¦tellus was let from his first besynesse for the sayd displeasure so that he purposed nat to vexe hymselfe from thensforth with out thanke or profet. And also he thought it foly to take in hande the charge of another mannes mater to his owne pa∣ryll / labour / and payne. Wherfore he send messangers to the kyng Bocchus / desyring hym nat to become ennemy to the ro¦mayns without occasion. And sayeng that he was as yet in su¦che case that he myght adioyne with the romayns felowshyp loue / and amyte: which shulde be moche better to hym & more profitable than batayle. And howbeit he trusted gretly in his power / richesse / and treasour: yet ought he nat to change cer∣tayne thynges / for thynges incertayne. For euery batayle to begyn is easy and lyght: but it is ver harde thynge to ende
the same whan it is ones begon. The begynning and endyn∣ge therof: is nat alway in the power of one same man. For warre may be / begon of a coward or of any other wretch: but it can nat be left of agayne / nor ceassed but whan it pleaseth hym which is strongest / and is maister hauynge the vpper hande. And finally he had hym better to prouide for hymselfe and for his kyngdome than he began to do: and nat to adioy∣ne nor myngle his goodes / treasour / & fortune: which were in estate royall florisshyng with the goodes and fortune of Iu∣gurth: which were lost and distroyed to the vttermost. The embassadours of Metellus came to kyng Bocchus & shewed hym their capitayns wyll: as is sayd before vnder suche sen∣tence. To the whiche wordes of Metellus / Bocchus answe∣red agayne benignely and mekely ynough sayng that he de∣syred nothyng more than peace: saue that he had pyte & com∣passion of the aduers & miserable fortune of Iugurth / but if the same Iugurth myght be suffred also to haue frendshyp and amyte with the romayns & forgyuenesse: than sayd Boc∣chus that he wolde gladly agre to euery thynge desyred of Metellus / and euery thyng shuld be accorded bytwene them. The capitayne Metellus heryng this answere of Bocchus: agayne sent messangers to hym replyeng agaynst his reque∣stes and sayenge that some of his peticions were agaynst iu∣stice & reason: also Metellus by these embassadours desyred many other thyng{is} of Bocchus / of whome Bocchus graun∣ted & alowed some: and other some of them he denyed. After this maner the tyme ouerpassed and proceded forth / massan∣gers often goyng and cōmynge bytwene them bothe: so that by suche maner the warre and batayle remayned vntouched and depended nat medled with: as Metellus dyd greatly co∣ueyt and desyre in mynde bycause he wolde kepe sure that lau¦de which he had wonne: and also for that to his owne paryll & dammage he wolde nat auantage nor auance Marius: in thynge whiche to hym belonged. ¶But here wyll I leaue to speke of Metellus / and retourne to speke of Marius whiche contrary to the wyll of all the no∣ble men of Rome was creat consull by fauour of the cōmens: lykewyse as I haue writen before. ¶Of the great ordynaūce and preparacyon whi¦che Marius the newe cōsull made agaynst Iugurth and for the warre of Nu∣midy. ¶The .xlix. Chapyter.
BVt Marius (as I haue sayde before) was elect consull / at great desyre and instaūce of the cōmen people: whiche also cōmytted to hym the prouince of Numidy. Marius seyng hym∣selfe thus auanced: where he was euer agaynst the noble men of Rome before / nowe was he specially fiers of mynde / and stately. And besy to displease and hurt the states: some tyme one by one / and other whyle altogyder. He often ty¦mes boosted & sayd that he had goten the consulshyp of them maugre their wyll / as if it were a pray or spoyling{is} goten of his ennemies: and of men ouercome. Many other boostynge wordes spake he to his owne commendacion / and to great displeasure and anger vnto the estates of Rome. But in the meane tyme he forgat nat to prepare euery thyng necessary to the warre: wherof the charge rested on hym to execute the sa∣me agaynst Iugurth from thensforth. He demaūded of the se∣natours & cōmens newe supplement of soudyours to repare and restore the army which was in Numidy with Metellus. For many of them were slayne / and many deed of sickenesse: thus was the army sore deminisshed. He called also for socors of suche nacions as marched to thempire. And of kyng{is} whi∣che were cōfederate and had conioyned felowshyp with the romayns. Moreouer he raysed vp in Italy and nere about Rome / as many as were strongest & bolde mennes bodyes. And namely such as he hymselfe had proued before in warre: and suche as in warfare were proued by dedes: and nat suche as were boosted by fame. And namely olde soudyours which had longe haunted the warre and were pardoned therof. So that it was in the power of no man to cōstrayn them to warre without their owne fre assent: bycause that they had cōtinued styll in warre the season to them assigned of their captayns. These treated Marius with so fayre flateryng and paynted wordes / that they were redy to go with hym in warfare. And how beit that the senatours were contrary to hym: yet durst they nothyng deny vnto hym belongyng to his besynesse: but gladly and with good wyll they decreed that he shulde rayse and chuse soudyours to fulfyll the nombre of them which wer lost in batayle in the contrey of Numidy. But this dyd they for no gret loue which they had to Marius: for they thought that he shuld lese outher the execucion of the batayle which he intended with Iugurth: or els the fauour of the people which wold refuse to go forth to warre. So that if Marius cōstray¦ned them: their olde loue myght tourne into newe malyce and hatered agaynst hym. But this thyng was trusted but in vayne of the senatours: for the moost part of the cōmens had
an inestimable desyre to go to batayle with Marius. For euery man cast in his mynde to be inriched by prayes & spoy∣lynges of warre. And that more is: to retourne home agayne victours with moche honour and triumphe. These thynges and otherlyke: they consydred / whiche caused them gladly to folowe Marius / and also Marius dyd nat a lytell enbolde & confort their myndes with his exhortacion. For whan euery thyng which he desyred of the senatours was confermed and decreed by them. And whan Marius shuld assemble his sou∣dyours: he thought to put them in confort by exhortacion / and also to trouble & displease the states of Rome as he was wont to do: and to chafe their myndes. Wherfore he assembled and called togyder a great company of the commen people / and spake to them by exhortacion and confortynge of them as herafter ensueth. ¶The orison or exhortacion of the consull Mari∣us: had to the cōmen people of Rome before his voyage into Numidy / whiche exhortacion is de∣monstratyue contaynynge the laude and prayse of Marius: and dysprayse and blames of the no∣ble men of Rome. ¶The .l. chapyter. RIght worthy cytezins / I knowe well that many of these estates of aunciēt name haue nat themselfe behaued after one maner of cōdicion in desyring of you hono∣rable dignities and great offices: and in administracion and gouernynge of them after they haue optayned the same of you. For whyle they make their peticions: at begynnyng they be dyligent / seruiable / meke / and curtayse of behauoure. But whan they haue optayned their desyre: than passe they their tyme in slouth / ydelnes / and pride. But it semeth to me in my mynde that they ought to do moche contrarely. For of howe moch more valour the hole cōmen wayle is: than is the cōsul∣shyp / thoffice of the hy iudge / or any other great office: with somoche more diligence & charge shulde the hole cōmen wele be gouerned / than suche dignities or offices desyred of you. Nor I am nat ignorant but knowe right well how great the benefite is that ye haue gyuen to me: and howe great charge and besynesse therto belōgyng is layed vpon me withall: whi¦che besynes I nedes must sustayne. That is to say: to prepa∣re
and make redy an army / withall other thynges necessary to batayle and to execute the same: & neuertheles to spare the cōmen treasour. To compell to warfare and batayle: suche as a man wolde nat greue nor displease: that is you the cōmen∣tie of Rome: whome I wolde nat displease by any meanes. To take charge and care for euery thyng within the cite and without. And to do such thynges among enuious gentylmen obiectyng and layeng agaynst me in euery thynge whiche I go about / as men full of discorde and variance. Verily no∣ble citezins among suche men to take in hande suche charges it is more harde and thynge of more dyfficultie / than any man can thynke or deuyse. And moreouer: as for other cōsuls whiche haue ben before my tyme / whan they haue done any thynge amysse: than their olde noblenesse / the strong and va∣lyant actes of their predecessors / the riches & power of their frendes and kynsmen: and their many clyentes and seruant{is} of them retayned: all these haue supported and mentayned them in their mysdedes. But all my richesse and helpe / and trust of confort which I haue / is in my selfe & nat in my kyns∣men or other fauourers: which ayde of my selfe I must of ne∣cessite defende with my vertue / strenght / and innocence. For all other thynges which these auncient noble men haue to de∣fende them be vnsure to me for I haue them nat. Farthermore noble citezins this I vnderstande that all ye haue good trust and confidence in me: and that all such as be equall / iust / and good: haue fauour vnto me. For I knowell that my good de∣des hath profited the commen wayle. And neuerthelesse these noble men seke occasions agaynst me / inuadyng and assay∣lyng me with their malice and enuy. Wherfore it standeth me in hande of necessite to labour somoche the more besely and quickely: that neyther ye be disceyued in this great trust whi∣che ye haue in me: and also that all the purposes of myne yl∣wyllers & aduersaries / may be frustrate and nothyng auayle agaynst me. Forsoth I haue euer from my chyldhode vnto this age ben of suche behauour that I haue ben acustomed & exercysed in all maner labours and paryls: whiche I suffred and toke paciently for the cōmen wele without any rewarde before this your benefite and honour whiche ye haue nowe gyuen to me. Wherfore worthy citezins seyng yt ye haue now rewarded me better than I am worthy: I haue nat purpo∣sed to desyst nor leaue of myne olde good wyll anenst ye cōmen wele: nor now I / rewarded of you purpose nat to omyt my good dedes which I dyd frely before vnrewarded. But tou∣chyng these aunciēt gentylmen: it is very hard for thē to tem∣per themselfe beyng in power or dignite which onely dyd but
fayne themselfe good and honest before they optayned promo¦cyon / to thintent to come therby to honoure and dignite. But where as I haue passed all my lyfe in right good occupaciōs by cōtinuall custome it is roted in me to do well: & this custo∣me is tourned with me into nature. Treuth it is: that ye haue cōmaunded me to warre agaynst Iugurth: whiche thynge these noble men taketh very greuously. I require you consy∣der and dyscus in your myndes and in your inwarde consi∣deracion / ponder ye: whyther it be better / more necessary and expedient to change the same your commaundemēt agayne: and to sende forth some other of that sort of auncient gentil∣men vnto this besynesse agaynst Iugurth or els to any other lyke. Send forth a noble man of olde auncetry: in honoure and remembrance of whome many ymages may be made & erect or set vp on hy. But of polycie of chyualry or warfare is he vtterly ignorant and inexpert. Wyll ye change your pur¦pose and sende forth suche one to warfare at pleasure of these gentylmen / as who sayeth: that is best to be done for this cau∣se. To thintent that in so great a mater and wighty besynesse: suche a captayne more ignorant and ferefull than any of all his soudyours / shalbe chosen of you whiche anone after shal chuse forth agayne some one of the commen people to be his maister: to informe and teche hym in suche besynesse as to his office and charge belongeth: hymselfe beyng ignorant of eue∣ry thyng necessary to be done. By this meane it often fortu∣neth: that he whome ye ordayne to be captayne and cōmaun∣der of your army: dothe chose an other to be captayne and commaunder ouer hymselfe. In somoche that (if ye indiffe∣rently iudge) he: whome ye chose for capitayne is moch more mete to be made a symple soudyours / than a capitaynr ouer other. And also worthy citezins: I knowe some of these noble men so farre out of order that whan they haue ben made con∣suls: than haue they gyuen themselfe to redyng of the actes of their elders and predecessours. And of the grekes preceptes of chyualry: which doutlesse may well be called men without order / for this cōsyderacion. For they shuld by due order first lerne to rule their office before they shulde take vpon them the charge therof. But they do contrary. First they take charge of office and than after lerne to rule it by way īordinate: how¦beit euery wyseman wyll first lerne to gouerne an office befo¦re he desyre it or take vpon hym the rule therof. But these esta¦tes contrarily demeane themselfe. Thus worthy citezins cō∣pare me a newe gentylman with their immoderate pride and take diligent considercion whiche is best: to be nat gentyll of byrth and lowly and gentyll of maners: or els to be gentyll of
blode / and proude and vngentyll of maners. Of suche thyn∣ges as they be wont to here & to rede: some haue I sene / and some I my selfe haue done. I haue lerned that by excercyse of chyualrie / which they haue lerned by redyng. Nowe iudge & cōsyder ye: whyther is better of dedes or warkes: of redynge and doyng. They dispyce my neweltie of honour & vnnoble lynage: and I dispyce the vncraftynesse & slouth of them. My happy fortune is obiected of them agaynst me as to rebuke: but shame and dishonest behauour / may be obiected & layed agaynst them in rebuke. Is it nat trueth that euery man is come of one lyke nature. I cōsyder & knowe well that one man is nat better nor more noble than an other: but if it be by his wysdome / good maners / vertu / and strength. And I cōsyder well that euery man the more that he is endued with vertue: the more excellēt & noble is he. Thus is the strongest / wysest / and moost vertuous / moost excellent in noblenesse. ¶But yf the fathers of Albinus / and of Calphurnius: lae consuls and captayns in Numidy / to the great dishonoure and damage of this empire / were nowe lyueng that it myght be inquyred of them whether they had leuer that I had bene begotten of them: or els the sayd Albinus and Calphurnius? What thynke ye they wolde answere? Forsoth nought els (as I suppose) but that they wolde desyre and couet good chyl∣dren and honorable lynage to procede of their stocke and ge∣neracion. Thus syth it is so: that these estates dispyseth me: reasonably and of ryght lette them also dispyce their owne predecessours and forefathers / of whose stocke and lyna∣ge they proceded: which came to noblenes and honour: nat by their auncetry: but by their owne strength / wysdome / and vertue: lykewyse as I haue done. They haue enuy at this myne honour. Than lette them also haue enuy at my labours taken for defence of the cōmen wayle: let them enuy myne in∣nocēce and great peryls / which I haue ouercōe. For by these meanes I haue obtayned & also shall mentayne this honour which they so greatly enuy. But these men corrupt by pride: after ye haue promoted them to worshyp: so pas forth their ty¦me as yf they sette nought by your offices and honours by you optayned: but vtterly dispised them. Thus they desyre such dignities of duety: as if they were worthy and deserued to haue them by their honest lyueng and vertuous conuersa∣cion. But certaynly they be greatly disceyued whiche loketh after two thynges cōtrary bothe togyder & at one season. So do these noble men. For they wold haue the voluptuous plea∣sure of slouth & ydelnesse / and the rewardes due vnto vertue and laborious dilygence. But whan these gentylmen vtter
their wordes before you or speke before the senatours: than in the moost part of their speche they exalt and commende their auncetry wenyng to be coūted more noble and excellent by re¦countyng and reducynge to remembrance the valiant dedes of their progenitours. But it is nothyng so. For how moche more excellent the fame & honour of their progenitour was: somoch more shamefull and reprouable is this cowarde ydel∣nesse of these gentylmen nowe lyueyng which so farre go out of kynde from the honorable conuersacion of their progeny∣tours: as if they had neuer dyscended of them. And verely this is certayne: the glorious dedes and honorable of forefa∣thers be lyke an example or luminary vnto their ofspringe or progeny. So that the same lyght suffreth neyther the good de¦des nor bad of their progeny to be hyd. For yf the progeny va¦rie from the glorious actes of their progenitours than the ho∣nour of both is distayned: but if they folowe them in vertue / than the lyght and glorie of the progenitours shynneth more radiantly by vertue of their progeny. Of this laude and ho∣nour of my progeny I can nat boost me for they were but of base degre. Their dedes can nat auaūce me nor make me no∣ble. But it is lawfull to me to speke of myne owne dedes whi∣che laude is moche more clere and excellent than to boost of other mennes actes. But nowe cōsyder ye how vnryghtwyse these gentylmen be to me: they wyll nat graunt me that laude and honoure by myne owne vertue and actes: whiche they vsurpe and proudely take vpon them: by vertue and dedes of other men. And wherfore thynke ye do they this? Planely I suppose bycause I haue no ymages of my progenitours ex∣alted in remembrance of them as these gentylmen haue: and bycause my noblenesse it but newe and springyng. But theirs is auncient and by their dysorder decaynge. But certenly I counte it more better and honorable to be rote and begynner of noblenesse vnto all my progeny and to leue the same vnto my branches: than to corrupt and defele noblenesse receyued of my progeny: as many of these gentylmen do. Forsoth I am nat ignorant but that yf these estates were nowe present & shulde answere to my wordes their speche shuld be abundātly paynted / ornate / and elegant ynough. But syth they cease nat to blame and reuyle with their lewde wordes in euery place both you and me for this your great office which ye haue gy∣uen vnto me: it hath nat pleased me to be styll nor to kepe se∣crete their fautes: lest some myght count culpable and worthy their rebukes: by reason of myne indyscrete pacien∣ce and sylence. Neuerthelesse sothely their wordes can nat greue nor hurt me: after the conscyence of myne owne mynde.
For if they say trueth they can nought say but good and wor∣shyp by me: but if they wyll nedes ly on me my maners / my lyuyng / and cōuersacion is suche that I shall ouercome their wordes & proue their iniust accusementes fayned and false. But syth your counsell is blamed of these noble men bycau∣se ye haue cōmytted to me this great honoure & gretter besy∣nesse: cōsyder ye in your myndes diligently & often whyther ye shall nede to repent you of this dede or nat. To say trueth I can nat boost my selfe of the ymag{is} of my {pro}genitors nor I can nat recoūt vnto you the triumphes or cōsulshyps of myne auncetry. But if the mater requyred: I coude well shewe vn∣to you speres / standerdes / horse / trappers / harnesse: with ma∣ny other rewardes of chyualry: some gyuen to me of thempe∣rour / and some of other captayns for myne actes in batayle. And other some which with myne hand{is} I haue won of then∣nemies of the empire. I coude also if it neded shewe you i the fore part of my body manyfolde scarres of many & large wondes whiche I haue taken in good worth for defence of our countrey and cōmen wele. These be my ymages which I can shewe. This is my noblenes: nat lefte to me by heritage (as theirs is to them) but noblenes which I haue won & go∣ten with great & sore labours of my body & paryll of my lyfe. ¶My wordes be nat ordred in ornate langage nor my spech ypaynted with rethorike lyke theirs for I set lytell therby. My vertue sheweth it selfe playnelie ynough without glosed or paynted wordes. But these noble men must of necessite haue craft for to couer their shamefull and vngoodly dedes / with this eloquent wordes / their crafty & rethorike speche. Nor as for me: I neuer lerned the greke letters nor langage / whiche thyng these estates obiect agaynst me: as a great faut. But to be playne: my pleasure was neuer moche to lerne such thyn∣ges / which haue lytell auayled vnto the techers or lerners of the same / neyther to acquisicion of vertue nor expulsion of vi∣ce. But I haue lerned & am taught in other thyng{is} moch bet∣ter / & more profitable to the cōmen wele: as to assayle & stryke myne ennemies: to dispoyle their ordynāce & vitayls: to chafe their garnyson. Nothing to drede nor feare / saue an yll name: to endure & take in good worth the pleasure of the somer & the hardenes of the wynter both in lyke: to ly vpon the grounde: to endure hunger & labour bothe togyder. Therfore I shall exhort & informe my soudyours with these preceptes: whiche I my selfe haue lerned / vsed & assayed. Nor I shall nat han∣dell or treat theym by craft to thintent that they may auaunce me with richesse: nor vse them sharpely and my selfe plesātly: but ī euery▪ difficultie I shalbe their example of labour: nor I
shall nat put the labour to them and take the worshyp to me. This order is profitable. Thus ought a captayne demeane hym among his soudyours and namely among worthy cite∣zins. For whan a man lyueth delicately hymselfe / and driueth his soudiours to the peryl of batayle by punysshemēt or other rygour: he is nat to be called a captayne or ruler of an army: but rather a proude lorde or tyrannous oppresser of citezins. Our elders worthely behauynge themselfe after this maner haue made noble & excellēt and inriched this cōmen wele: and themselfe also. But these estates which nowe lyueth trustyng to be honoured by the worthynesse of their {pro}genitours / they thēseffe vnlyke of cōdicions despice vs & haue vs in disdayne whiche folowe the maners of their {pro}genitors. And euery hye office and all honours they chalange & demaunde of you nat by their merites: but as it were of duetie and heritage. But othely the ouer proude men erre moche from the trueth. For though their {pro}genitors & auncetry haue left vnto them euery thynge which to them was possible to leaue: as riches / patri∣mony / & their ymages: for remembrāce and example of them & of their worthy dedes. Neuerthelesse their vertue haue they nat left vnto them: nor they coude nat kepe it: for that onely can neyther be gyuen vnto them in rewarde nor receyued of any man. These gentilmen say that I am a man without ma¦ners & vnclenly of behauour. And why? Forsoth bycause that I prepare & dresse nat curyously many delicyous bankettes so su{per}fluous & deyntyous as they do: and bycause I haue no iougler nor dysar wt me to moue sportes & dissolut laughing: nor no more curyouse coke than one of the vyllage longyng to rural people / which thyng{is} to haue as these gentylmen haue: it pleaseth me nat to knowledge. For I neuer had pleasure in such thynges. For I haue herde of my father and of other in∣corrupt and well disposed men: that suche delyciousnesse and curyosite belongeth vnto women. And that labour and besy∣nesse belongeth vnto men. Euery good man: thynketh it mo∣re cōuenient to haue plentie of worshyp than of richesse. And more honoure it is to a good man to haue the walles of his hous garnysshed & ouercouered with armour / wherewith he may defend his coūtrey / his frendes / and hymselfe than with riche ornamētes of curyous warke of no profet saue onely the syght & vayne regarde therof. But syth these gentylmen thus obiect suche maters to me: let them cōtinue alway in such vi∣ces which lyketh thē / and that they haue euer reputed so dere. Let them incline to voluptuosite: as daunsyng / synging / ban∣kettyng / playng / to lechery / to glotony / & dronkenes. For in suche vices haue they spende their youth: in the same let them
pas forth their age: vtterly subdued to the bely / to slepe / to ydelnes / and subiect to the lustes of the vylest part of the bo∣dy. Let them leaue the swete of fyghting / the peryll of deth / the blyndyng of dust in batayle: and otherlyke paryls vnto vs / to whome these be more acceptable / than their feestes and voluptuous bankettes or other vyle pleasurs. But they do nat so / they be nat so contented. For after that such vngoodly and vyle men haue dishonested themselfe / by their foule de∣des: than be they redy to take a way the rewardes of good men vnto themselfe. Thus (agaynst all right) lechery and slouth moost cursed vyces dothe no hurt to such as occupyeth them: but they be vtter distruction to the cōmen wayle / and cōmens which be innocent and vnculpable. ¶But syth I haue made answere to these dysordred gentyl∣men: and that moderately after my custome and cōdicion and nat so largely as their cursednesse & vices ar worthy. I shall speke nowe a fewe thynges touchyng the commen wele. And first of al haue ye good trust & asperance touchynge the besy∣nes of Numidy. For ye haue nowe moued & auoyded euery thyng wherby Iugurth was defended from begynnynge of the warre vnto this tyme: that is to say the couetyse of Cal∣phurnius / & of Albinus: the vncraftynes and foly of Aulus: and the pride of Metellus. By these founde Iugurth socour hytherto: but all these be auoyded nowe. Moreouer ye haue there an army which knoweth the contrey / but verily it is mo¦re noble & manly than fortunate or happy. For a great part therof is wasted & spent (and that wors is) infected and cor∣rupted: what by the auarice and by the vnboldnesse & cowar∣dyse of their captayns. Wherfore ye which be of lusty age and mete to endure the hardnesse of warre & batayle: nowe labour ye with me / and take ye in hande the defence of the commen wayle. Nor let none of you be afrayed nor abasshed for misfor¦tune of the other soudyours which haue foughten there before this tyme nor of the pride of their captayns. For I myselfe as coūsellour of your besynesse & felowe of your peryls shall be present with you in euery besynesse bothe in your iournays & in your batayls also. So that I shall gouerne you & my selfe without difference / and vnder one forme in euery poynt. And verely by helpe of the goddes we shall within short season ob∣tayne all auātages & cōmodities which any man may wyn in batayle / as prayes / victory / with immortall laude & worshyp. And certaynlie if these pleasors & auantages were in dout or harde to obtayne (as they be nat): Neuerthelesse it were cōue¦nient to euery good man (as ye be) to socour & defende the cō∣men wayle of their coūtrey fro distruccion & dyshonour. For
certaynlie there was neuer man whiche obtayned immortal laude nor euerlastynge name by cowardise or sluth. Nor there was neuer wyse father which wold wysshe his chyldren or sonnes to lyue euer: but onely that they myght lyue so long as they behaued themselfe worthely in goodnesse & honesty: and so to passe forth their lyfe as natural course requireth. ¶Worthy romayns: I wolde speke more vnto you if I vn∣derstode that strength coude be encreased to feble or fearfull men: by wordes: but it is nat so. Wherfore me semeth that I haue sayed ynough and abundantly to noble and bolde har∣ted men: as my trust is to proue you. ¶Howe Marius after his exhortacion endyd: anone laded shyppes with ordynance of warre and sende forwarde with the same one Mālyus his imbassadour: and howe he himselfe anone af¦ter folowed withal his company. And howe he behaued hymselfe in Numidy at fyrste begyn∣nynge. ¶The .li. Chapyter. WHan Marius had vttred and en∣ded his word{is} vnder this forme: and whan he sawe al the myndes of the cōmens encli∣ned to the war in trust of victorie & prayes. Than anone without more delay he caused shyppes to be charged wt viteyls / & treasour for the soudyors wages with armour / we∣pyn / and all other thynges necessary to war. And cōmaunded one named Aulus Manlius / which was assigned embassa∣dours to hym: to departe forwarde with the same shyppes so charged. In the meane season Marius hymself remay∣ned at Rome a lytel tyme: and chose forth soudyours suche as hym thought most expedient: and nat after the custome of the olde romayns his predecessours nor after institucion of the aunciēt captayns / which had ordred cartayne maner of peple of whome soudyours shuld be chosen for warfare in tyme cō∣uenient. But cōtrary wyse Marius admytted euery man in∣differētly which was any thynge lyckely and had pleasure to go with hym. And many suche he admytted also whiche were poore and nat suffred to go warfare before: lest their pouertie myght haue constraned them rather to fal to robbery than to dedes of chiualry. How beit / it was inacted of the olde ro∣mayns that suche excused of warre for cause aboue sayd:
shulde pay a certayne somme of money pretaxed towarde the wages of such as laufully were admytted to warre. Marius suffred none of these to pay any thynge at al: but elect many of them for his soudyours. Many of the romayns surmysed that Marius elected vnto warre these abiect parsons: for want of other good soudyours. Some other demed that he so dyd for fauoure / ambicion / and parcialite: bycause this sort of people assisted and honoured hym by auauncement at begynnynge of his promocion. And also men consydred that vnto a man desyrous of dignitie and power: the moost nedy men be moost mete and behouable. For suche nedy wretches be moost auenturous: for they haue nought to lose and alway trust in auauncement by auenturynge themselfe. And ther∣fore they iudge euery thynge which they do: good / honest / and laudable: if any auantage be therto appendant. Thus dout they no paryll so that they may come therby to promocion. At last Marius departed from Rome with somwhat gretter nombre than was graunted and decreed to hym of the sena∣tours. Within fewe dayes after that: he toke shyppyng and arryued in the prouince next vnto Affrike vnder the romayns at a towne named Vtica. The army whiche was there with Metellus / was delyuered to hym by one Publius Rutilius / which was embassadour with the sayd Metellus. For Me∣tellus hymselfe fled the syght of Marius bycause he wolde nat se that with his eyen / which he coude nat endure to here. But whan Marius had restored and fulfylled the legions of his soudyors / and the cohortes for the subsidyes and rescous. Than went he into a plentyfull place of Numidy which was full of prayes. All that he toke there: he gaue frely inrewarde to his soudyours. This done: he assayled suche castels and townes which were but febly defended with men and walles. He had many batayls & lyght skyrmisshes: and many other thynges he dyd in other places nat with moche difficultie. In the meane tyme the newe soudyours were redy manly fyghtyng without fere: and seyng that they which fled were other taken or slayne: therfore they aduysed them wel that the strongest and boldest was most sure of all. They consydred wel that it stode them in hande to defende with wepyn and armour their libertie / their countrey / their frendes / and all other thynges longyng to their helh and honour. Thus la∣boured they for glorie / laude / and riches whiche they optay∣ned: so that within short season the olde soudyours and the newe encreased togyder cherisshynge and infourmynge one an other tyl their vertue and boldnesse was lyke. But whan the two kynges Iugurth and Bocchus vnderstode of the
commynge of Marius: they deuyded their hoostes and went in sonder into dyuers places where no man coude attayne to them for difficultie of the places. This was done by counsel of Iugurth. For it pleased hym so to do trustyng that within short space the romayns wolde be spred abrode in spoylinge and than thought he to assayle them in euery place whan they were moost without fere at libertie / at large / and vnprouy∣ded: as men ar wont to be specially whan their ennemies be∣haueth them as if they were affrayed. Than often be the vi∣ctour improuident and lesse circumspect. ¶Howe Metellus the olde consull retourned to Rome: and of the worthy and valyant be∣hauour of Marius agaynst Iugurthe and of his great actes at his begyn∣nyng. ¶The .lii. Chapyter. IN the meane tyme Metellus returned to Rome: which contrary to his opinion was re∣ceyued with glad myndes of the romayns & after that the enuy which Marius had moued against hym was asswaged and ouerpassed: he was lyke dere and beloued both to the cōmens and senatours. ¶But Marius on his part applyed and toke hede to his owne besynesse and his ennemies also: without slouth but with great wysdome. He perceyued wel & knewe what was good and yll for auātage on both sydes. He caused the wayes and iournayes of the two kynges to be dayly serched & espied. He preuented and interrupted their coūsels / prouysions / and gyles. He suffred nothyng to be vnprouided and vnredy on his syde: but of the other syde and party of his ennemies: he suffred nothyng to be sure or prouided: for alway he preuen∣ted their {pro}uisions and pursued them. Often whyle Iugurth and the Getulyans spoyled the Numidyens whiche had yel∣ded thēselfe to the romayns Marius was redy in their way & valiantly assayled them: and ouer thrue many of them / whyle they were dispersed abrode and fleyng away for feare. And also nat ferre from the towne of Cirtha / he made Iugurth hymselfe so trust in his flyght that for hast to ren away: he laft his armour behynde hym. But whan Marius cōsydred that his acres were onely glorious and excellent without any auantage: and that he myght nat eecute batayle with Iu∣gurth for his vnstedfastnes and mouyng from place to place:
he consydred in mynde and ordayned hym redy to besyege the cities of the countrey one after another. And namely suche as outher of men or of place were necessary and behouable to his ennemies / and contrary or hurtfull to hym. This dyd he thynkynge: that if Iugurth without dystourbance suffred hym so to do he shuld other be spoyled and bereft of his cities / ordynance / socours / & refuge: or els he must abyde the fortune of batayle & stryue for the maistry in playne feld. Bocchus the kyng of the mauriens had often sende messangers before vn∣to Marius: sayeng that he wolde gladly come into fauour / amyte / & frendshyp of the romayns: and byddyng Marius nat to dout hym as an ennemy nor to fear any thyng longing to an ennemy to be commytted of hym agaynst the romayns. It is but lytel knowen for trueth whether Bocchus fayned this thing to the intent that his cōming to batayle vnknowen, & vnproued myght be to Marius more greuous: or els whe∣ther he was wont by vnstablenes of mynde to change peace somtyme for warre: & somtyme war for peace. But Marius the consul (as he had purposed before) drue hym vnto the ca∣stels and townes whiche were walled & defended: and fiersly assayled them. Anone he tourned many of them from his enne¦mies to hym▪ some by strength & violence / some by feare: and other some by {pro}misyng & gyueng of rewardes & prodicion of their captayns. But at first begynnyng he medled but with meane castels & townes thynking that Iugurth shulde come to defende and socour his people & townes: and so come into danger of the romayns. But whan Marius herde that Iu∣gurth was far thens and occupyed in other besynesses: than thought he nat to lose his tyme: but to auenture on gretter thyng{is} wherin was more harde besynesse and gretter labour & honour. Wherfore he entended to besiege the cite of Capsa / whiche was a great cite / stronge / and riche. ¶How Marius wanne the great and rych cytie named Capsa: and how he vtterly distroyed the same and gaue all the rychesse therof to hauocke among his soudyours. ¶The .liii. chapyter. AMonge the most wydest and thickest wyldernesses of Numidy was this great and ryche cite named Capsa: whiche (as men say) was first bylded by that Hercules whiche was borne in the lande of Libya: and nat by Hercu∣les the sonne of Iupyter and Alcumena. Thinhabitours of
this cite were ruled by Iugurth peasably & easely put to no charges nor besynesse / and therfore were they moost true and faythful to hym. They were defended agaynst al ennemies: nat onely with walles / armour / and men: but also with moche stronger defence of the difficultie & hardnesse of the place and contrey nere about them. So that it was in maner impossi∣ble that any army coude cōe nere them for want of water and scarcite of vitels. For except the feldes & places nere to the cite all the other be voyde & wast grounde & desart without habi∣tacion / vneared / barayne / and drie without water. All full of serpētes: which were somoch more violent and fiers for lacke of meat and sustenance / as al other wylde beestes be wont to inrage for hunger. And moreouer the myscheuous and peri∣lous nature of serpentes is more kyndled to ragyng and ve∣xed with thyrst / than with any other thyng: which thyrst they coude nat quench there for want of water. Wherfore neyther man nor beest myght surely passe by them. Whā Marius cast al these difficulties in his mynde: his hert was persed with a merueylous desyre to wyn this cite / both for that it was moch hurtfull to hym: and profitable to Iugurth / and also bycause it was harde to do and moche honour myght be gotten in wynninge therof. And moreouer bycause Metellus the other consull before hym had won the cite of Thala / with great ho∣nour and glory: whiche of sytuacion was nat vnlyke to this cyte: nouther vnlyke in defence. Saue that nat far from the walles of Thala were a fewe fontayns: but about this cite of Capsa was no water / wel / nor fontayne: saue one and that was within the walles of the citie alway full of water. All other whiche dwelled without the walles / as in the suburbes: occupyed but rayne water. The inhabitantes of that contrey and of all the remenant of Affrike / which were far from the see and rude people coude moch the better endure this scarsite of water and thirst: for this cause. For the moost part of them were fed with mylke and venyson nat lokyng after salt / sau∣ces / nor other suche thynges as be norisshynges or prouoca∣tiues to glotony. They toke meate and drinke onely to sake their hunger / and to quenche their thirst: and nat without measure to prouoke themselfe to pleasure of the flesshe / as many christenmen do nowe ī our dayes: which make of their bely their god. And eate nat to lyue: but they lyue to eate con∣trary to mānes lyfe / and vtterly enclined to bestialite. O cur∣sed glotony let vs christēmen lerne her of panyms to eschewe the: whiche wasted the body and goodes: damnest the soule: and art mother and norice of al vices. But to retourne to my purpose: this Marius after that he had serched euery thynge
by his espyes / he proceded in his interprise and purpose (as men thought) holpen of the goddes. For agaynst so many & harde difficulties he coude nat haue made sure prouision by counsell of man nor by his owne priuate wyt: as he whiche had impediment and was letted nat onely by shapnesse of the contrey: but also by lacke & scarcite of wheat and of all other corne. For the numidiens intēdeth more / to norisshe pasture for beastes than to labour or ere the groūde for corne. And al∣so they had brought togyder all the seed and corne of the yere befor into strong holdes as their kyng Iugurth had cōmaun¦ded them and moreouer at that season the feldes on euery syde were dry and bare without corne: and no maruale. For it was about the extremite or later ende of somer. Nat withstandyng all these difficulties and sharpnesses Marius made {pro}uision ynough as the mater required. First he commytted all the bestes which he had taken in pray in foretyme vnto the horse∣men / whiche of their owne wylfolowed hym to war: or were sende to hym for helpe by frendes of thempire. Marius com∣maūded them to take charge to driue forth these beast{is}. Than sent he Aulus Manlius embassadour of the hoost to a towne named Laris / and al the cohortes of his soudyours with hym which were fotemen and lyght harnysed for to kepe the trea∣sour of the soudyours wages and vitayls: whiche he had lefte in the same towne. Marius kept his coūsel of this interprise so secrete that none of all his company hye nor lowe knewe of his purpose nor whan he intended. But whan Manlius and his company shulde depart towarde Laris: Marius dissi∣muled with them sayeng that he wold stray abrode in Numi¦dy in rouyng and afterwarde within fewe dayes: he and his company wolde come also to the same towne of Laris / laded with prayes of his ennemies. This done he de{per}ted towarde a flod named Tana: no creature liuely knowyng of his pur∣pose. And euery day he distribued in his iournayes amonge his boost .xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle / which he cōmaunded to be deuided by euyn porcion amonge them by hunders and halfe hunders togyder: deuidyng vitayls to euery company after their nombre. And in the meane season he charged bot∣tels and bowges to be made of the hydes of the same beastes and of other ledder in great nōbre. Moreouer he eased their scarcyte wheate and other corne: by wyse prouision. And without knowledge of all his company he made good proui∣syon of euery thing / which might be necessary vnto his army in tyme of nede. At conclusion the syxt day after whan they were come to the sayd flod of Tana: thyder was brought a myghty multitude of bottels and bowges made of ledder.
There pytched they their tentes with easy labour and small defence. Than refresshed they themselfe with meate and drin∣ke: and eased themselfe a certayne space. This done: Marius commaunded them that euery man shulde be redy to procede forwarde euyn with the sonne goyng downe and that euery man shulde onely lade hymselfe and his beastes with water in the sayd bowges and bottels leauynge al other cariage / burthens / and baggage: there behynde them in their tentes / vnder the custody of other soudyours therto assigned. After this whan he sawe his tyme: he departed forthe from his ten∣tes with his company: and lauboured al the nyght longe in his iournay. The day after folowyng he rested in a secrete & couert place. In the same wyse behaued he hymselfe the nyght next ensuynge: and in the thyrde nyght moche before the day lyght / he entred into a fayre and large felde ful of smal hylles and downes / no more but two myle space from Capsa. And there he taryed withal his hoost in the moost priueest maner abidynge the day lyght. But assone as the day began to ap∣pere: many numidyens yssued forth of the towne: some to dysporte themselfe: and some about their besynes / nought fearyng nor suspectyng of their ennemies. Whan Marius sawe that: anone withal haste he sent all his horsemen to the towne / and with them as many fotemen in lyght harnesse as were moost swyft and spedy. Whome he commaunded to ren withal hast and boldely and valiantly to assayle the towne: and to besyege the gates. Than after he hymselfe folowed spedely: but with good hede and aduisement: nat sufferynge his soudyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fal to robbyng nor prayes by spoyling of their ennemies. Whan thinhabitantes of the towne knewe herof: their case was vnsure / their feare great and horrible: for the sodayne chaunce of them was nothynge suspected before / nor prouy∣ded. Many of the cetezins whiche were without the towne and were taken and in power & captiuite of the romains their ennemies sent vnto them within the towne desyring them for saue garde of their lyues to yelde themselfe and the cite to Marius. So was it done at cōclusion. Howbeit this nat wt∣standyng Marius brent the cite. All the numidyens inhaby∣tantes therof which were of ful age & able to bere wepen were slayne: and the remanent as women / chyldren / and aged men were taken prisoners and solde for their raunsome. The pray and richesse was deuyded among the soudyours. This dede agaynst the lawe of armes was nat thus done by Marius: by couetyse nor any outher crueltie of hym: but bycause the towne & place was {pro}fitable / and necessare to Iugurth & to the
romayns harde to come to. And the maner of the people pro∣ued mouable and vnlauful euer of nature before: and neyther refrained from their yll appetite by benefite or good dede: nor yet with awe or feare of punysshement. ¶Howe Marius by fortune more than by stren∣gth wanne the strongest castell of all Numidy / wherin were the tresours of Iugurth. ¶The .liiii. chapyter. AFter that Marius had brought to ende so great and harde an interprise with∣out any losse or dāmage to hym or any of his peple. Though he were reputed noble / great and excellent before: than began he to be counted more famous & excellent. Euery noble dede: was reputed to be done by strength & wysdome of Marius: and ascribed to his strength and polycie. And that suche thynges as were done by good counsell and prouision / and also suche as hapened by fortune or chance: and by neglygence of their ennemies. The sou∣diours were so manerly treated without crueltie or fiersnesse of their captayne / and also made riche and abundant in trea∣sour and iewels: that they exalted and praysed his name to the heuen. And loued hym as themselfe. But in contrarywyse the numidyens feared hym more than any man lyuynge. Shortly to speke: both the frendes of thempire and ennemies also thought verily that outher Marius had a godly mynde and was a god hymselfe: or els that he was priue with the goddes: and dyd all his dedes and besynesse by their aduyse / counsell / and prouision: which shewed hym before what shuld fortune after. But whan this chaunce had fortuned so well at Capsa: anone Marius drue hym to other townes / and toke as many as he besyeged. In some townes the numidyens re∣systed hym to their power: but it coude nat auayle. In many other townes the dwellers gaue them ouer and left them voy∣de and ran away feryng so to be treated & delt withall as they of Capsa were: bycause their townes were lyke behouable to Iugurth▪ and hurtfull to Marius. Whan Marius came to any such towne: destitute and voyde of dwellers he set fyre in them & brent them grounde smothe. The aged men / women & chyldren: toke them to wodes and caues to hyde themselfe. The yong men & lusty which were taken were slayne downe right. Thus was euery place fylled with wepyng & wayling /
brennyng and slaughter: one mengled with other. Finally af yt Marius had won into his handes / many townes & castels: and some without resystence or blode shedyng of his men / he went in hande with an other maistry and difficultie nat so sharpe nor harde to come to as was Capsa / but to be won or besyged it was nat les harde nor of les difficultie. ¶Nat farre from the flod of Mulucha (which water deuy∣deth the kyngdome of Iugurth: from the kyngdome of Boc∣chus) was a great rocke or mountayne of stone in myddes of a playne: open ynough to be sene hauyng thervpon bylded a meane castel of quantite: but of a meruaylous altitude & one∣ly one strayet passage and narowe / left to cōe therto. But on euery other syde the rocke of naturall growyng was downe right lyke a wall: as if it had ben made for ye nones with man¦nes hādes. Marius purposed with all his might to take this castell: and namely bycause the tresours of Iugurth were wt∣in the same. But this his purpose at last came to effect / rather by chaunce of fortune / than by prouision or counsell. For this castell was garnisshed & plentuously instored with men / we∣pen / vytels / and withall orther ordynance requisite & necessa∣ry to defence of such a forteres. Moreouer win the same was a fountayne plētyful of clere water. And besyde this the sytua¦cion therof was such that without maruelous difficultie & vn¦mesurable labour none ennemies myght attayne or approche nere therto their ingynes of batayle to frusshe the walles or any other part therof. Besyd al these defēces the double wal∣les o this castel were garnysshed wt towres / bulwarkes / & all other defences & ingynes which coude be ymagined by man∣nes mynde: and that rownde about in compasse aswell with∣in / as without. The way therto: by which the inhabitantes & garnison vsed to go and come / was very strayet and narowe. Insomoch that the romayns entryng by the same way with their ingynes of batayle were cōstraned to cut their pauases on both sydes and to make them more narowe for strayetnesse of the passage. And in suche maner they proceded forwarde vnder the same in great paryll and with moch difficultie: and at conclusion all in vayne. For whan they were come nere to the walles and wolde haue set vp and adioyned the same pauases to the walles to haue vndermined vnder them: all their labour was frastrate. For what with stones and what with fyre the defenders of the castel brake and brent them agayne downe to the grounde. Thus cowde nat the soudyors whiche vndermined the walles contynue togyder at their worke and besynesse: for strayetnes and difficultie of the place and importune violence of them within the castell. Nor other
soudyours coude nat serue them whiche made and repared the pauases without great paryll & daunger. For continually as fast as they raysed the pauases to couer and defende them selfe: they were broken and brent bytwene their handes. In the meane tyme no soudyour was so good / strong / nor bolde: but that he was outher wounded or beaten done to deth. Than was feare encreased to other that were feble and faynt herted. ¶But after that many dayes & great labours in this maner were ouerpassed and spent in vayne. Marius was sore angred & vexed in his hert reuoluyng many thyng{is} in mynde: but specially whyther he myght gyue ouer his pur∣pose (seyng his labour frustrate) or els abyde the chaunce of fortune which at many tymes before he had founde fauorable and frendly to hym. Whyle Marius chafed & brennyng in de∣syre reuolued suche thynges in his mynde both day & nyght: it hapened by chaunce of fortune that a certayne lumbard a symple soudyour / one of the company whiche was last sende from Rome to Numidy to supply the army strayed abrode from his cōpany a lytel way which lumbarde as he wandred founde among the stones many smal snayles crepyng on the grounde: nat far from that syde of the castel which was ouer agaynst the syde which the romayns besyged and assayled. Bycause this lumbard in his coūtrey was acustomed lyke other of his countrey men to eate such snayles prepared after their maner: therfore he gathered first one and than an other / and after that many: ascendyng vp by lytel and lytel: somty∣me crepyng somtyme clymmyng / for no other intent or pur∣pose saue to gather such snayles: and so far he {pro}ceded by lytel and lytel tyll at last he came almost to the top of the mountay∣ne. But whan he sawe all that syde of the castel desolate and no person steryng: anone he began̄e to haue a pleasure & de∣syre in his mynde for to worke some maistry / as the propertie and cōdicion is of euery man couetyng to wyn a name / laude and riches: and to be spoken of. By chance of fortune in the sa¦me place where the lumbard stode in this aduisemēt / among the stones grue a great and olde oke tre hauyng the myddes a lytel bowyng downe towarde the groūde: and the remanēt crokyng vpwarde agayne with myghty armes and branches ascendyng to the hyest of the walles with the top erect & lyfred vp as euery herbe & tre of nature is wont to growe vpwarde at the top. This lumbard well aduised the same & aduentured to clyme vp warde takyng his holde somtyme by the branches and bowes of this oke: and somtime takyng holde & leauyng by the stones which appered forth in the wall tyl at the last he attayned vnto the very top of the wall. And whan he sawe no
man styring on that part there stode he styl espyed of no man and noted & cōsydred wel at his pleasure al the inwarde part of the castel and the playne within the walles about the towre. This lumbard had somoche the more leasour to take so long aduisement vnespyed for al the numidyens defenders of the castel were on the other syde attendyng & gyueng hede to the assaut and defendyng themselfe and the castel agaynst the ro∣mayns. Whan the lumbard had espyed and consydred euery thyng which he thought myght be auātage to his after pur∣pose: than he descēded agayne downewarde by the same way which he ascended: but nat without hede nor with so lytel ad∣uisement as he ascended vpwarde: but prouyng euery way / and lokyng about yf it were possible to brynge into the castel any cōpany of men by that syde or nat. This wel consydred: assone he descended: anone he went to Marius and infor∣med hym of euery thynge as he had done exhortyng & requi∣ryng hym to put in profe whether the castel myght be won on that syde where he had ben. Farthermore he {pro}mised hymselfe to be gyde vnto such as wold vndertake that intprise sayeng that in the mater was no danger. Marius heryng these wor∣des of the lumbard / sende forth with hym certayne of his men of them which were there present to vnderstand & knowe the trueth of the mater. Whan they had ben there & retourned to Marius agayne: some brought hym worde that the mater was easy to do: and some other sayd that it was very harde & perylous. The sentēce of euery man was after as their mynd gaue them. The cowardes thought it harde / but such as were of bolde hertes and desyrous of worshyp thought it easy and without moche peryl. Neuerthelesse the mynde of Marius was somwat exalted to cōfort / and good hope: and therfore of al the company of trumpettes / and of other such mynstrels as be wont to be in batayle to gyue courage and signes to the figters / he chose forth fyue which were moost swyft & moost lyght and delyuer: and .iiii. hundred men he assigned to assyst and defende the sayd trūpettes. And al them he cōmaunded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled & ordred by hym in euery thyng. The day next folowyng was assigned to them to pro∣cede forth ī their besynesse. Whan the tyme assigned & prefixed by Marius was come the lumbard wt his cōpany had made redy and ordred euery thyng: and so went to the place where be had ben before. But whan they were come thyder: the lum∣bard their gyde caused them to change their armour / and to make bare their heedes and their fete: to thintent that they so bare heded the better might se aboue them and on euery syde of them: and that they beyng bare fote myght labour somoche
the better and take better hold in clymming vp by the stones. Their swordes were fastned behynde at their backes & their buckelers withal / which were made after the fassion of the nu¦midyens buckelers of lether: bycause of lyghter weyght and burthen. And also to shintent that they shulde gyue lesse soun∣de or noyse / if it hapned any stone to smyte agaynst them. This done: the lumbard went vp before them / and bounde smal cordes to the stones and to the olde rotes whiche apered aboue the stones where he coude espy any suche wherby the soudyours sustayning themselfe & takyng holde might more lightly & with more ease mount and clym vpwarde. And som∣tyme he went before and helped them vp with his handes spe∣cially such as for that vncustomed way were somwhat fereful. Somtyme whan thascendyng or goyng vp was ouer harde and sharpe: he put eche of them vp before hym without ar∣mour: and than he hymselfe folowed with their armour and wepyn. Suche places where moost dout was in: he specially proued and assayd them moost of al: and in goyng & comyng often tymes vp & downe by the same moost dangerous passa∣ges: he encreased audacite & boldnesse to the remenāt. Thus after they had ben sore weryed / and with long & great labour endeuored themselfe: at last they came into the castel / whiche on that syde they founde desolate & without defence. For (as sayd is before) al they which were with in the castel were occu¦pyed in fightyng / or redy to fight agaynst the romayns: as they were on other dayes before. But whan Marius vnder∣stode by messāgers how the lumbard had done: how beit that al the day before his men had ben sore besied and occupyed in fightyng: & assayling the castel. Neuertheles specially at this tyme he exhorted & enbolded them: and he hymselfe departing forth from vnder his pauases caused his soudyors to adioyne themselfe nere togyder / & to holde vp their sheldes aboue their heedes / so that the cōioyning of them semed as it wer the fra∣me of a volt. Marius kept hym vnder the same for his defen∣ce / & so approched to the walles. And both he & his company whiche were nere about hym valiantly assayled the castel: and also other of his cōpany which stode a far of & coude nat come nere the walles for prease: assayled the castel fiersly from a far and sore vexed and put in feare their ennemies within the ca∣stel throwyng agaynst them plumettes of leed with slynges / arowes / dartes / and al other maner engyns of batayle wher∣with any thynge coude strongely be throwen into the castel. But the Numidyens within the castel had often before this tyme ouertourned and brent the tentes and pauases of the ro∣mayns and toke therby so great audacite and boldnesse that
they defended nat themselfe within the castel walles: but wal∣ked vp and downe without the castel walles bothe day and nyght reuilyng and reprouynge the romayns and obiectyng cowardyse agaynst Marius. And thretnyng that his sou∣dyours shulde be made subiectes and bonde men to Iugurth in tyme to come / whome they purposed at that tyme to make bonde to them. Thus whyle they thought themselfe sure and their mater in good case: they were harde and egar ynough reuylinge and thretnynge the romayns. In the meane space whyle the romains and their ennemies were besyest fighting withal their myght: the romayns for laude / glorie / and lord∣shyp: and the Numidiens for their helth and sauyng of their lyues. Anone sodenly the lumbard with his company which were within the castel on the backsyde blewe their trumpet∣tes. First of al the women and chyldren which went to the walles to se the bykering were al abasshed and fled inwarde to the castel: and after them al the soudyors which were with∣out and nerest to the walles and coude escape in. And finally they all bothe armed and vnarmed fled inwarde. Whan the romayns sawe this they assayled the castel more fiersly: some they slewe and ouerthrue: some they wounded ouerpassynge or standyng vpon the bodyes of them which were slayne. Al their desyre was with their handes to wyn glorie and wor∣shyp. They stryued to ascende vnto the walles euery man co∣uetyng to be before other. None of them al taryed nor was let with spoyling{is} nor prayes. Their great courage suffred them nat to loke there after / tyl by manhode and strength they had won the castel. Thus was fortune fauorable to Marius: so that his first negligence and vnwyse boldnesse to assayle a ca¦stel inexpugnable / was tourned by chance from rebuke to glo¦rie and laude / such was his fortune. But whan Marius had won this castel after estimacion of man nat able to be won: than was he lorde of the moost part of al the treasour of Iu∣gurth: the castel was gyuen al to murdre and hauocke. And the soudyours of Marius richely rewarded euery man after his desert. ¶How in the meane tyme whyle this castel was in wynnynge / a noble man of Rome named Lucius Sylla: came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsemen: and of the maners & behauour of this Sylla. ¶The .lv. Chapyter.
IN mean tyme whyle this fiers assaute and victorie was concluded at this castel: a fa∣mous lorde of Rome named Lucius Sylla / tre∣sourer of the army came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsmen. Whome the same Marius at his departyng from Rome had left there to rayse and assemble socours vnto the war among the Italiens and other nacions frendes and louers of thempire of Rome. ¶But forasmoch as the matter moueth vs to make mencion of so worthy a man and of his disposicion and maners: ther∣fore it semeth me conuenient in this part somwhat to write of his behauour & conuersacion: and that as brefely as I may conueniently: namely for two causes. The first for that I in∣tende nat to make relacion of his behauour & maners in any other place of this cronycle saue here. Secondly for asmoche as none other authour hath written sufficyently of hym. For howe beit that one hystoriagraph named Lucius Sisenna: wrote most dyligently and best of his actes of any other be∣fore neuertheles me semeth that he spake lytel acordynge to trueth nor indyfferently. For his tong nor pen were nat at ly∣berte for asmoch as he was sōwhat in danger to ye sayd Syl∣la: wherby he was prohibyted to say or to write / acordyng to ye trueth. For what by fauour & what by fere he durst nat tou∣che playnly the vices which were in hym. But here I purpose (all fauour and fere layd a part) indifferenly to write of him. ¶This Sylla of progeny: was descended of moost noble stocke of the remaīs. Howbeit the name of his auncetry was almost lost and decayed by dulnesse / negligence / and slouth of some of his lynage. In greke and in laten he was of lyke con∣nyng: and excellently seen in both the langages. His mynde was great / and bolde of courage. Of voluptous pleasours he was desyrous: but moche more desyrous of glory & laude. In vacant leser he was moch enclined to ye lustes of his body. But suche pleasure or voluptuousnes dyd neuer let nor with∣holde hym from any besynesse or ocupacion necessary: howbe¦it such pleasure so blynded hym that he toke no wyse of byrth / maners / and honestie cōuenient for his estate. He was moch eloquent of speche crafty & subtyll ynough. He had the wayes easely to get frendshyp / and it was also no maistry to get frēd¦shyp of hym: in fayning / dissimulyng / and counterfaytinge of besynesses: his wytte was very hye and excellent. He was a marueylous & incredyble gyuer of many thynges / but spe∣cially of money: and before the warre and victory which the noble men of Rome: had agaynst the cōmen people: He was so noble & worthy reputed that it is in maner incredyble: nor
his good fortune neuer passed the policy of his wyt: in somo∣che that many men were in dout whyther he was more fortu∣nate than strong. But after the victory of this warre: so vn∣goodly was his demeanour & so cruel / that verily I knowe nat whyther I may more be asshamed or greued to write it or to speke therof. For after that this warre of Numidy was en∣ded: & both Marius & this Sylla were retourned to Rome: a great discorde fel bytwene the lordes & cōmens. Marius toke part with the cōmons: but Sylla toke part with the lordes and at last droue Marius forthe of the citie. After that: an other man of great power called Cynna whiche had ben fyue tymes cōsull of Rome gathered an hoost of men and toke part with Marius agaynst this Sylla. But at cōclusion Sylla ouercame hym in batayle: and slewe hym. After this: Sylla cruelly murdred an other noble man of Rome named Caius arbo: and with hym yonge Marius / sone of this Marius which warred in Numidy. Last of al whan this Sylla had won victory ouer Marius & his fauourers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somoch that he fylled al the citie with blod of the citezins. But here wyl I leaue to speke farther of this Sylla / or of his behauour ī cruelte: and returne to write of his behauour in this warre of Numidy vnder Marius. ¶After that this Sylla (as I haue sayd before) was come to Affrike & to the hoost of Marius with his cōpany of horse∣men: within short season he became most expert in chiualry & crafty aboue al other: howbeit before this tyme he was but ru¦de & ignorant of dedes of chiualry. And moreouer he treted & gouerned his soudyours with maners & mekenes. And ga∣ue rewardes to many: to some whiche desyred hym: and to some other of his owne pleasure non desyred therto. But he wolde take no rewardes nor gyftes agayne / without it were agaynst his wyl. And if he so dyd at any tyme agaynst his wyl: than was he more redy to gyue agayne that which was gyuen to hym: than to pay that money which he had borowed of other. He demaunded nothyng agayne of any man though it were due and det to hym: but rather he laboured and ende∣uored hymselfe that many myght be in his det / and by suche meanes to haue them bounde to hym. And how beit that he was one of the grettest of Rome: yet disdayned he nat the cō∣pany of the most symple soudyours of the hoost: but cōmuned and acompanyed with them both in sportes & in sadnes. In labours he was alway redy. In batayle & in watchyng{is} with other besynes of warre he suffred no man to be before hym. Nor ī the meane season he neyther hurt the good name of the cōsul nor of none other good man: which thing men desyrous
of worshyp & honour be often wont to do for in dispraysing of other they thinke to obtayne great laude to thēselfe. He onely laboured that none might passe hym neyther in counsel nor in might / or manhod of his hand{is}. But he passed many. By whi¦che maners & condicions in short tyme he became very dere & wel beloued / nat onely to Marius: but also to al the hoost. ¶How Marius preuayled in batayle agaynst both the two kynges / Iugurth and Boc∣chus. ¶The .lvi. chapyter. BVt whan Iugurth had lost the towne of Capsa / as is sayd before: and dyuerse other fortresses and other places defensy∣ues which to hym were profitable. And al∣so a great quantite of his treasour / wher∣in he moost trusted: Anone he sent messan¦gers to kyng Bocchus requiryng hym in al hast to come to Numidy and to bryng his army with hym: sayng that it was hye tyme to make batayle with Marius. But whan he vnderstode that Bocchus prolonged the tyme in ouerlong taryeng / hauyng dyuers cōsyderations of peace and warre / as he that was in dout of the chaunce and fortune of the ende therof. Iugurth agayne corrupted the next of his counsel with gyftes in lykewse as he had done before: and promysed vnto the kyng Bocchus hymselfe / the thirde part of the kyngdome of Numidy: if the romayns were dryuen out of Affrike / or yf the war shulde be brought to ende without losse or diminisshyng of his kyngdome and marches therof. The kyng Bocchus induced with hope of this reward: with a great multitude of people came to Iugurth / and adioyned both their armies togyder in one. ¶At this tyme Ma∣rius with his cōpany was in his iournay towarde the {pro}uin∣ce which was in the coost of Affrike & apartayned to thempi∣re: where the sayd Marius purposed to rest with his cōpany / tyl the wynter were past. But whan he was in his iournay & in leest dout: Iugurth and Bocchus bothe togyder inuaded and set vpon hym and his men whan the tenth part of the day scarsly remayned. This dyd they: thynkinge that the nyght which was nere come shulde to them be great socour and de∣fence if they were ouercome: and if they dyd ouercome the ro¦mayns: it shulde be to them no damage nor impediment by∣cause they knewe the contrey & place better than the romains. But on the other syde bothe these chaunces: in darkenesse
were harde and contrary to the romayns: for they knewe nat the coostes of that countrey. Marius anone had vnderstan∣dyng of the cōmyng of his ennemies by many of his espyes: but it was ouerlate. For assone as he had worde: his ennemi∣es were euyn at hande. In somoch that before the army coude be set in order or aray: and or they coude remoue or gather to∣gyder their baggage which at that tyme was abrode: and be∣fore they coude take any cōmaundement of their captayne by worde or sounde of trumpettes: The horsemen of the Mau∣rians and of the Getulians ran togyder vpon them nat in or∣der nor aray of batayle: but by companyes and bendes togy∣der / as it fortuned them to come togyder in heapes and clu∣sters. The romayns for the moost part: were al amased and greuously abasshed for that sodayne and vnprouided feare. Neuerthelesse they forgate nat their olde manhode & strēgth some drue them to their armour: and other some whiche were armed alredy defended their felowes tyl they armed thēselfe. Other some mounted on horsebacke and boldly rode agaynst their ennemies: and encountred them valyantly. The fyght on both parties was more lyke a skirmysshe among brigan∣des and rouers than to any apoynted or ordred batayle. For the horsmen & fotemen were mengled togyder without stan∣derdes / cognysances / or any ordynaunce / aray / or order. The Maurians & Numidyans were fierse on their syde. Some of the romayns they beat downe and ouerthrue. Some they wounded mortally: And many they bereft vtterly of their ly∣ues / and slewe them in that place. The remenant which shar¦pely and manly resysted they compased them about on euery syde: and aswel behynde as before assayled them: so that ney∣ther manhode / strength / nor armour: was able sufficiently to defende them: And no maruel for their ennemies were mo in nombre than they: and compased them about on euery syde of them. But finally the romayne soudyours which were bothe of olde and newe: and therfore bothe strong / bolde / and crafty in batayle: gathered them as nere togyder as they myght. And where it fortuned any nombre of them to mete togyder: they tourned backe to backe / & ioyned them rounde one with an other in maner of a compase or cercle: and so they saued & defended themselfe togyder that on the backehalfe no man coude assayle them: but yf he brake in through the myddes of them whiche was in maner impossible. By this maner they sustayned the myght of their ennemies: and also saued them∣selfe. Nor their captayne Marius in this ieopardous and sharpe besynes was nat affrayed at al / nor of lesse corage and boldnesse than he was before: but styred about euery where
in the batayle. And his men of garde about hym whome he had chosen rather of the strongest and boldest men of the host / than of such as were moost familier with hym. For he set mo∣re by the audacite of them / thā by the familiarite of the other: and namely in such a ieopardous case. Sōtyme he socoured his soudyours in their nede / or such as he sawe in paryl. And somtyme he ran in amonge his ennemies: where they were thyckest. And nat withstandyng their resystence he assayled them valiantly: and wounded / slewe / and ouerthrue them on euery syde he dyed his weapen in the reed blode of the blacke Mauriens and Getuliens. And bycause that in so harde a case: and in so great and troublous noyse & rumour / he coude nat counsel nor confort his soudyours with his tong / therfo∣re he thought to counsel / incorage / and confort them with his hande / gyuyng them example surely to bestowe their strokes. Many of his ennemies sende he to hel cryeng in vayne vpon their ydoles for helpe. The dartes / iauelyns pykes / plumet∣tes of leed / stones / with other suche instrumentes of batayle wer cast so thicke on both parties / that the ayre therwith was indymed. The strokes were so coursly charged on the bright helmes and harnesse / that the fyre sprange out on euery syde: so that it semed to be the lyghtnyng: the cry of the men dyeng: the neyeng of the horses: and the dyn of the strokes / with the sounde of the trumpettes: was horryble and tedyous to here. Thus continued they tyl the day lyght was passed / and the nyght come. The numidyans / getulians / and maurians de∣systed nor ceassed nothing for that. But as both Iugurth and Bocchus before had warned & cōmaunded them: they conti∣nued more sharpely than before / thynking that the darkenesse of the nyght shulde be for their auātage. Marius this vnder∣stādyng toke counsel & made best {pro}uision for hymselfe & his men: whiche he myght in suche case: and as the mater requi∣red. And to thintent that his people myght haue some place to resort vnto / for refuge & socours: he prouyded before and ocu∣pyed two hylles nere togyder of whome the one was ouer na¦rowe / & of lytel groūde to receyue his hole army & tentes: but in the top therof was a fayre fountayne of pure water moch necessary. The other hyl was sufficiētly large to receyue his hole hoost and tentes: and also very defensyue / for it was of a great altitude and done right on euery syde. Insomoche that they whiche shulde take that hyl were sure ynough without great defence of themselfe / for nature had it sufficiently de∣fended. This wel considred: Marius commaunded Sylla his vndercapten to take with hym al the horsmen / and to ta∣ry that nyght about the smaller hyl where the fountayne was.
This done: he hymselfe gathered togyder by lytel and lytel the remanent of his soudyours dispersed abrode: their enne∣mies being nat lesse troubled than were they. Whan Marius had thus assembled agayne his men togyder he led them all with ful cours vp vnto the larger hyl. Thus the two kynges Iugurth & Bocchus seyng it in vayne to fyght with thē whi∣che were on the hyer groūde / and also on so sure a place: were cōstrayned to leaue the fyght: for difficultie of the place which the romayns had taken. But neuertheles in the meane tyme they suffred nat their men to depart far thens: but compased bothe the hylles roūd about with their hole multitude & there taryed & rested / shed abrode vpon the ground. Whan they had taken their place in this maner: they made great fiers here & there in many places of their hoost: and the barbarians after their custome passed forth the most part of the night in myrth / pleasure / & gladnes / reioysing / daunsyng: and making great noyse and dyn: rennyng and goyng from place to place: and loudly crieng / synging and reuellyng. The kynges themselfe were also nat a lytel proude and fearse: bycause they had nat fled from the batayle: and counted themselfe as ouercomers seyng that they helde the romayns so besieged which as they thought durst nat abyde them. On the other part the romaīs intētyfly gaue aduertēs to the demeanour of their ennemies. And for that the romayns were on the hyght of the hyl and without lyght: therfore more easy from darknesse of hyer pla¦ces they parceyued al the dedes and behauour of their enne∣mies which were beneth them: and moch more euidently by light of the fyers. This vnwyse behauour of the numidiens put the romayns in great confort and was great courage to them. And specially Marius was greatly confermed in hope seyng their negligence / their folly / and vncraftinesse: wher∣fore he cōmaunded his folke to kepe sylence as styl as might be possible without any noyse. In somoche that he suffred nat the trūpetes to soūde the watche: as warryours ar wont aga∣ynst night. Afterwarde whan the day began to apere: the nu∣midiens were al weryed wt their cryeng / ouerlate watchyng / and reuel: and had gyuen thēselfe to rest a lytel before as men without feare or dout of ye romayns. But certenly it is a true {pro}uerbe which is often sayd: that after fayre wether succedeth tēpestious cloudes: and aft myrth & ioye often cometh sadnes and sorowe. So it hapened to the numidyēs. For whyle they ingorged & fylled with wynes lay slepyng on the grounde as beestes without fere & without {pro}uision: Marius cōmaūded sodenly all his trumpetes & clarionistes with other mynstrels to sound their instrumētes as shyrle as they coude altogyder
and that al his soudyours shulde set vp a shout or cry as hor∣ribly as they myght: and with that inuade and breke into the tentes of the numidyens. This was shortly done: wherfore the numidyens / mauriens / & getuliens astonyed and abas∣shed with that vnknowen and horryble noyse: were sodenly awakened of sleape: and seyng them thus cōpased with their ennemies: what for feare of deth and of the noyse they were so amased that they had no power neyther to fle nor to drawe to them their armour / nor vtterly to do or prouid any maner so∣cour for themselfe. Thus they stode astonyed for this horrible noyse and cry as yf madnesshe had entred them: none able to socour hymselfe nor other. The romayns alway increased to them their noyse and feare assayling / murdring / and woun∣dyng them without any resystence. Finally al they were ou∣ther ouerthrowen / slayne / or woūded: or els fled their armor / standerdes and weapen left behynde them: and mo were in this batayle slayne: than in al the batels before. For amonge them al none was taken prisoner: for with fere and sleape so amased were they / that fewe escaped by flight. ¶Of the great prouysion and wysdome of Ma∣rius after his victory: and of the seconde batayle which he had agaynst the two kynges / in which also he had great vyctory with laude & honour. ¶The .lvii. Chapyter. WHan Marius had gloriously thus ouer come the moost part of his ennemies except the two kyng{is}: he drue hym than towarde his wyn∣tring places as he had purposed before. And or∣dred hymselfe & his men specially in hauen tow∣nes bycause of more easy {pro}uision of vytels: but neuertheles: in his iournay thyderwarde: for al his victory: he becam nat negligent / vnware / nor proude: as captayns often ar wont aft victory goten of their ennemies: but he {pro}uided and went forwarde with his army quadrat and deuided into four par∣tes ordred & apoynted as if his ennemies had ben in his sight Sylla was assigned to take charge of the ryght wyng of the army and al the spear men with hym. And Aulus Manlius of the lyft wyng. And with hym the slyngars / archers / & the cohortes of Lumbardes. The peticapitayns with fotemen of lyght harnesse: were distributed and dyuided in the vant∣garde and rerewarde. Of the treatours whiche had forsaken Iugurth and came to the romayns: suche as were best labou∣red
and knewe best the contrey / were chosen forth and sent out to espy the contrey and wayes of Iugurth & Bocchus. But nat withstandyng Marius hymselfe was as prouident / cir∣cūspect / and diligent withal: as if he had cōmytted the charge to none other. He was mouyng cōtinually from place to place ouer all the army: laudyng / cōmendyng / and rewardyng the good soudyors: and blamyng and rebukyng the bad he hym selfe armed / and diligently prouidyng and ministryng vnto them euery thyng necessary and expedient: and cōpelled them that were frowarde and ylwillyng to labour. In euery place where he set his tentes in his iournay: he ordred defence with depe dyches and trenches rounde about his hoost. And in the entres of the tentes he assigned soudyors elect therto to kepe watch and some to kepe scoutwatch about the tentes in com∣passe. Moreouer some other he ordred on the castynge of the dyches and on outwarde bulwarkes to defende the remanent if any sodayne peryl apered. He hymselfe armed nyghtly wēt about and serched the watch. Nat specially for any feare nor mystrust of any paryl to come nor for feare that his soudy∣ours wold nat obey his cōmaundemēt. But specially to then∣tent that the loudyours seyng their captayne nat refusyng la∣bour nor paryl: shuld be also more wylling to folowe the same and to take payne vpon themselfe as ashamed if they dyd nat asmoch as their captayn. And certenly at this tyme & at many other during this warre (as I rede) Marius cōstrayned his soudyors to labour rather for shame thā wt sharpnes or punis∣shemēt. For shame it is to the seruant to be ydle whā the mai∣ster sore laboreth. Howbeit some sayd that Marius toke this labour vpon hym for the desyre of cōmendacion & worshyp: bycause that frō his youth he was euer wont with hardnesse / hunger / thirst / and labour: and many other thynges whiche the delycate gentylmen of our tyme count for miseries. But to Marius were these hardnesses moche pleasure and delyte for affection whiche he had agaynst the commen wayle / as equal persones supposed. But to what euer intent Marius: treated his army in this wyse: it was knowen that his dedes dyd asmoche profet and worshyp to the commen wayle of Ro¦me: as if he had more rigorously and sharpely treated his soudyours. For al thynges were ordred wel and worthely for the honour and profet of the commen wayle: as if he had mo∣re rigorously treated his army. ¶But to retourne to my purpose: whan Marius with suche dyligence as sayd is: was come nat far from the towne of Cirtha / at the last the fourth day after the forsayd batayle: the espyes of their ennemies appered on euery syde. The romaīs
vnderstode anone therby that their ennemies were at hande. The espyes of the romains also which were sende forth: bro∣ught the same tidynges from euery coost of the coūtrey. Ma∣rius perceyued that his ennemies were in diuerse cōpanyes and deuided: wherfore he was vncertayne howe he myght best order his hoost to receyue them: And therfore perceyuing it vnsure: how to order the forfront of his batayle as it ought: he abode his ennemies in the same place no order chaunged with his hoost deuyded in .iiii. partes (as sayd is) as he whi∣che was redy and prouyded for euery chaūce. Thus was Iu∣gurth disceyued and frustrate of his purpose. For he had de∣uyded his hoost into four partes trustynge to inuade some of the romayns on the backehalfe with parte of his army: and with an other part to encoūter with them / and with the other two partes to enclose them on both the sydes: and so to enuy∣ron them rounde about. In the mean tyme Sylla which first encountred with Iugurth exhorted & cōforted his men aswel as he might for breuite of the tyme. That done: anone he pro∣ceded with his company by bendes & clustres togyder / their horses conioyned in the moost thyckest maner: and so fiersly assayled the Maurians. The remanent of the fotemen whi∣che were vnder Sylla: remayned and kept themselfe styl in their first place: and defended their bodyes from the dartes whiche their ennemies thrue agaynst them from farre. But if it chaunsed any of their ennemies to come bytwene their han¦des: they hewed them downe to decrease the nombre. ¶Whyle Sylla and his horsmen thus fiersly were fightyng on the right wyng of the batayle: The kyng Bocchus assem¦bled togyder the fotemen whome his son named Volux / had brought thyder with hym. These fotemen had suche impedi∣ment in their iournay thyderwarde that they came ouerlate to the other batayle whiche was last foughten before this. Wherfore Bocchus: whan he had assembled & inbolded with his word{is} these fresshe fotemen: with them he assayled fiersly the rerewarde of the romayns. ¶In the meane tyme Marius hymself was occupyed in the forwarde of his hoost and there employed his wysdome and strength / as a valyant and worthy captayne: and so stode it hym in hande. For in the forwarde Iugurth hymselfe with his grettest power & strōgest cōpany of men inbatayled with hym. ¶But after that Iugurth knewe of the cōmyng of Bocchus to the felde: anone he turned hym with a smal cōpa∣ny about hym priuely vnto the fotemen of the romayns: and there with an hye voyse he cried vnto them / sayng that they fought but in vayne. For a lytel before he had slayne Marius
with his owne handes. And in cryeng these wordes he lyfted vp withal / and shewed his swerde al ouersprincled and dyed with blode: whiche he had so couloured in the batayle fiersly ynough in murdring the fotemen of the romayns. These wor¦des Iugurth cryed in latyn tong. For he had lerned to speke latyn longe before in the batayle of Numaunce. Whan the ro∣mayns herde these wordes they were affrayed / but more for crueltie of the noyse: than for any confidence or trust whiche they had to the messanger. But on ye other syde the myndes of the barbariens wer bolded & exalted by these wordes: by rea∣son wherof more sharpely they inuaded the romayns / seynge them abasshed & astonyed. And nowe were the romains of the forwarde at that poynt that they were redy to gyue themselfe to flyght: as men dyscouraged for the sayd tidynges. ¶Whan they were at this poynt: it fortuned so at the same tyme that Sylla had beaten and ouerthrowen the mauriens which inuaded and assayled hym on the right wyng of the ba¦tayle: wherfore he retourned to his cōpany & fiersly assayled the fresshe fotemen which wer with Bocchus / and at one syde brake in amonge the thyckest of them. But Bocchus anone tourned his backe: and gaue hymselfe to flyght. ¶On the othersyde Iugurth which in his part of the batay∣le almost had optayned vyctory dyd his diligence to incoura¦ge & support his cōpany: and to mentayne that auātage whi∣che he had won. And at cōclusion al in vayne. For whyle he la∣boured there about as a worthy captayne: the spear men of the romayns so cōpased hym & his cōpany about both on ye right syde & on the lyft: that al his garde & other which were about hym at conclusion were slayne. But he hymselfe glad to saue his lyfe / brake forth alone from among ye myddes of his enne∣mies: and from wepyns and dartes with great difficuly. ¶But in the meane tyme Marius had ouercome & driuen away the horsmen which assayled hym. Wherfore anone he re¦turned fiersly to helpe and socours of his company whome he vnderstode somwhat put backe by violēce of their ennemies. But he by his policy and valiant dedes anone so reconforted his men that none of his ennemies were able to withstande their violence in any part of that batayle. ¶Thus finally the romayns after great labour and many greuous woundes disconfited their ennemies on euery syde. But whan the batayle was ended and the romayns began to pursue the chase: than verily it was a pytefull and horrible syght to beholde in the open feldes and to consyder the cruel spectacle of batayle. Howe some fled: Some pursued / some inraged murdring / some rored dyeng / some slayne / some ta∣ken
prisoners. The horse and men mengled togyder: labou∣ring in the panges of deth. The ground ouerspred with deed corpses mangled / mutulate / and horribly hewyn: inuolued in blode cōgeled. The horse wounded: as mad drewe after them the deed carcases of their maisters / their legges hangyng in the styropes / and their speares halfe thorowe their bodyes trayling after in the dust. The coursers wounded and fleyng cast vp with their fete the dust tempered with blode rennyng ouer the deed bodyes of their lordes. Many of the Numidiēs which were sore wounded coude neyther fle: nor be suffred to take rest on the grounde. Somtyme they laboured to ryse & auoyde: and anone after for feblenes fel downe to the ground agayne: eche rowlyng & turnyng in other blode. And finally: as far as any mannes syght myght extende / al the grounde was ouerspred and couered with armour / wepen / and deed caryons rennyng of blode. And al the ground infect with the same / horryble to beholde. ¶Howe Bocchus after that he was thus twyse ouercom in batel / purposed to make peace with the romains: and howe at his request Marius sende vnto hym Sylla and Manlius to knowe his mynde in that behalfe. ¶The .lviii. Chapiter. AFter that this batel was thus ended to the vtter damage & distruction of the Numidy∣ans: and to the laude & honour of the romayns. Marius was nowe without dout ouercomer & victour and went vnto the towne of Cirtha as his iournay and purpose was at first begynnyng before these two batayls. Whan Marius had soiourned there fyue dayes aft this batayle: there came vnto hym embassadors frō kyng Bocchus. Whiche in their kyng{is} behalfe desyred of Marius to sende vnto hym two of the most trusty men whiche he had: sayng that he wold cōmen & treate with them of dyuers besy∣nesses both for his owne profet / & for {pro}fet & auātage of the ro∣mains also. Marius without tary sende forth Sylla for one: and Aulus Manlius for an other. Whan they were come to kyng Bocchus: howbeit he had sende for them to cōmen with them in his maters. Neuertheles it was cōcluded bytwene them to speke to hym first to thentent to kyndell and inflame his mynde the more agaynst Iugurth: or els seyng hym som∣what desyrous and wyllyng to haue peace to prouoke hym wt more desyre therto. Wherfore Sylla (to whom Manlius ga∣ue place nat for his age / bur for his eloquence) began & spake to Bocchus in maner: as foloweth.
¶Of the wordes of Sylla tresourer of the roma¦yne army had before kyng Bocch{us}. The .lix. cha. KIng Bocchus we haue great gladnes and ioye syth it is so that the goddes haue thus admonis∣shed & enspired you so noble a man that at last ye haue reputed peace better & more acceptable than war: lest ye myght dishonest & defyle your worthynesse by associating yourselfe to the moost vnhappy tyran Iugurth. And also we ar glad that ye haue auoyded the occasion & necessite: wherby we were moued to pursue in batayle: you beyng ignorant of our quarel: and in the cōpany of ye sayd most cursed Iugurth tyran & ennemy to thempyre of Rome. And certenly ye people of Rome euer syth their poore / simple / & smal begynning ha∣ue thought it better to wyn frēdes than seruātes or bondmen and also they haue thought it a moch surer thyng to haue vn∣der their empire suche as wyllingly & of their owne mocion wolde yelde thēselfe: than such as they haue cōstrayned therto agaynst their wyl. But verily no frendshyp is more necessary to you than our amyte or frendshyp. At first of al: bycause we and ye be farre in sonder: wherby we shal haue les power to greue you / or to put you to any charge: by reason of our frend∣shyp. But our fauour & thankes may be as redy to you: as if we were nere togyder: cōsydering the many & great frendes whiche we haue nat far from your marches. And also vnto thempire of Rome be obeyers / subgettes & seruantes abun∣dantly. But as touchyng louers & frendes we nor none other can haue sufficiently ynough. For this consideracion kynge Bocchus your frēdshyp shalbe more acceptable vnto vs. And wolde god it had pleased you thus to haue done at the begyn∣ning of this war. Forsoth if ye had so done: than shulde ye be∣fore this tyme haue receyued of the romayns mo cōmodites / auantages / and good dedes than ye haue nowe suffred losse / damages / or hurtes. But whyle it is so that mannes dedes & besynesses (for the moost part) be ruled by fortune: to whiche fortune it hath pleased that ye shuld both proue and assay our myght and violence in batayle: and also our loue & fauour in peace: Therfore nowe syht amytie is proferred to you by suf∣fraunce of fortune: and syth it is lauful to you to take it: be nat slowe from hens forwarde / but hastely procede as ye haue be∣gon: that ye may proue the romayns frendes to you lyke as ye haue proued them ennemies before this tyme. Ye haue ma∣ny expedient oportunites & necessary cōmodites by whome ye may make amendes wt your good dedes for that ye haue offē∣ded agaynst the romayns & ouerpasse your olde fautes with
newe kyndnesses and benefites: and finally fix this in your hert that ye or any other shal neuer ouercome the peple of Ro∣me with kyndnes or good dedes. And as touchynge their hatered / and of what myght they ar in batayle: yet yourselfe knowe that by profe & experience. Wherfore procede in acqui∣ring of their frendshyp: whiche gladly shalbe graunted vnto you / if your merites shal so deserue. ¶Of the answere of Bocchus made to Sylla: and of the vnstablenesse of mynde of the same Bocchus. ¶The .lx. chapyter. TO these wordes of Sylla answered Bocchus myldely and soberly: and a fewe wor∣des he spake in excusing his offence done agayne the romayns / sayeng that he had nat taken ar∣mour nor begon war agaynst them as ennemy to do iniury or wrong vnto them: but to defende his owne kyng∣dome. And that the thirde part of Numidy belonged vnto hym by lawe of armes: of the which the romayns laboured to expel Iugurth. And in that doyng they distroyed his part of the contrey: whiche he coude nat suffer vnreuenged. More∣ouer Bocchus sayd for hymselfe that he had sende vnto Ro∣me before to require amyte and frendshyp of the romayns: which thing vnto hym was denyed. But at cōclusion he sayd: that he wolde omyt & lay a part al olde malyce & that althyng shulde be done and agreed bytwene them: yf Marius wolde graūt hym that his embassadours might be sende to Rome: for the sayd frendship to be cōfederate with ye romains. Vpon this answere Sylla & his felawe retourned to Marius whi∣che anone agreed yt the same embassadors shuld be sēt to Ro∣me. But shortly after: what tyme Iugurth vnderstode of the cōmyng of Sylla & Manlius he feared the same thyng / whi∣che was ordend & in hande. And anone wt rewardes so he cor∣rupted the frendes of Bocchus: that agayn they chaūged his mynde with their counsel: so mutable and variable was he of mynde. ¶How Bocchus chan̄ged his purpose yet ones agayne: and sende newe embassadours to Ma∣rius to treat of the peace: and howe Sylla recey∣ued and treated them in absence of Marius. ¶The .lxi. chapyter.
IN the meane tyme Marius set and or∣dred his hoost in their wyntring places & toke wt hym such men as were of lyght harnesse: and al∣so a part of his horsemen: & with them went into a desart nat far thens / to besige a certayne towre belongyng to Iugurth: into whiche towre the sayd Iugurth had put for garnyson & defence: al the treators which had for∣saken & fled from the romayns to Iugurth. But in the mean whyle Bocchus of new agayne cōsydred in mynde the misfor¦tune whiche had hapened to hym ī the two batayls before. Or els by counsel of some other of his frendes: whome Iugurth had nat corrupted with reward{is}: he chose forth among al .v. men whose fidelite & trueth he had wel knowen & often proued before: and whose wysdome was most expert & redy. Them sende he to Marius: & cōmaūded them afterwarde if the ma∣ter required as embassadors to take their way to Rome: and cōmitted to them his ful authorite in euery thyng which was to be done: and to cōclude the war by what euer maner shuld seme best / and moost expediēt to their discrecion. These em∣bassadours toke lee & spedely toke their iournay to the pla∣ces where the romayns soiourned the wynter season. But whyle they wer ī their iournay thyderwarde: they were assay¦led of theues of the getulians / and robbed & spoyled of al that they had about them. Thus at last without worshyp or appa∣rel: all affrayed & abasshed they fled vnto Sylla for refuge. This Sylla was left by Marius in the wynteryng places: to be ruler of the romayne army in his absence. What tyme these embassadors: thus spoyled were come to Sylla for refu¦ge / he receyued them nat fayntly as vayne & vnstable enne∣mies as they deserued: but curteysly with moch gentylnes & liberalite / treatynge them in al poyntes honorably. By this meanes these barbariās & rude people counted and supposed that the name of couetyse / whiche was imputed vnto the ro∣mayns by cōmen fame was but false & fayned of their enne∣mies / to distayne their honour. And also for the moch libera∣lite of Sylla: they counted hym as their special frende. For yet vnto that tyme: the accloyeng of gyftes gyuen for rewar∣des for policy & falshode to ouercōe couetous or simple myn∣des / was vnknowen vnto many. No man was liberal ī gyft{is}: but that he was thought & coūted to be faythful of hert withal. Thus the barbarians reputed the liberte & reward{is} of Syl∣la to be a great & euident token of loue which he had to them: as they demed. But to our purpose: the embassadours anone opened & declared to Sylla the wyl & cōmaundemēt of Boc∣chus their kyng: gyuen to them to be excuted: And also they
required hym to be vnto them a frendly fauourer & counsel∣lour in their besynesse. Farthermore with their wordes and spech they cōmended & exalted the army / the trueth / the great∣nes & excellence of their kyng: and al other thyng{is} which they thought might auayle them to optayne benyuolēce of the ro∣mayns. After they remayned with Sylla about the space of xl. dayes: whiche graunted them al his helpe and socour and also in the mean space enfourmed them in what maner they shulde order their wordes whan they shulde speke with Ma∣rius / and also before the senatours at Rome. ¶How Marius harde them bassadours of Boc∣chus & sende them to Rome: and how they were answered of the senatours. ¶The .lxii. chapyter. IN the mean tyme Marius whiche was in assaut of the kynges towre coude nat perfourme his enterprise. Wherfore he retour¦ned againe to Cirtha: anone was he certified of cōmyng of the imbassadours of Bocchus. Wherfore he cōmaunded them & Sylla also to come before hym: and also he called togyder all the moost worthy men of his hole hoost from euery place. Before them al presently he cōmaunded the imbassadours of Bocchus to reherse the petycion of their kyng (which rehersed & harde) it was graunted vnto them to go Rome for the same poyntes. And of Marius was truesse required in the meane tyme by∣twene Bocchus and hym. Sylla with many other noble mē were pleased withall. A fewe other fiersly and sharply coūsel∣led otherwyse: as men without pyte and ignorant of others harde fortune whiche whan it begynneth to be frowarde and contrary: it tourneth euery thynge to aduersyte. ¶But whan ye mauriens had obtayned of Marius al their desyre: thre of them went to Rome with one named Octauy∣us Rufo: whom Marius had assigned to conuey thē thyder This Octauyus Rufo was sende before from Rome into Af∣frike to Marius with wages for the soudyours. The other two imbassadors of Bocchus returned home agayne to their kyng: whiche of them gladly harde of the good report whiche they made of the Romayns in euery poynt: and specially of the good wyl / lyberalite / and courtesy of Sylla. ¶But whan the other thre imbassadours were come to Rōe they apered before the senatours and in the humblest wyse yt they coude deuise / dyd their message excusynge their kynge:
and confessyng that he had offended agaynst the empyre nat by his owne sekyng: but by the cursed faut prouocacion / and instygation of Iugurth: wherof their kynge sore repented. Wherfore in his behalfe at conclusyon they besought the ro∣mayns of pardon / amyte / and peace. Than was it brefely an∣swered to them in this maner. ¶The senatours and people of Rome: is wont to remembre both the kyndnesse and benifytes of their frēdes: and also the iniuryes of their ennemies. But syth it repēteth and forthyn∣keth Bocchus of his trespas: grace and pardon of his offence is graunted vnto hym. Peace and amyte shalbe also graun∣ted vnto hym hereafter / whan he shal so deserue. ¶How Marius sent Sylla agayne to Bocchus at his desyre: and what danger the same Sylla escaped by helpe of Volux / son of kyng Bocchus. ¶The .lxiii. chapyter. WHan Bocchus vnderstode al these thin¦ges: he desyred Marius by his letters to sende vnto hym Sylla: to thentent yt after his aduyse & discression coūsel might be had of the cōmen be¦synesse to bothe parties belōgyng. Sylla anone was send forth wt a great retynue of fotemen & horsemē: with diuerse weapen & stronge defēce as archars / slyngars / with otherlike. And to thyntēt to spede their iournay more hastely: they were al armed wt lightest harnes which coude be {pro}uided but for al the lightnes of their armour it was defēsite ynough agaynst the weapyns of the mauryans: for their wepyns be light in likewyse. But finally whan Sylla had passed fyue dayes of his iournay: sodenly Volux the son of Bocchus ape∣red and shewed hymselfe to the romayns in the open feldes: with no mo but. M. men which went scatered and dyspersed abrode neglygētly: so that they semed to Sylla: and al other a greatter nombre than they were in dede. Sylla and al his company feared them / thinkynge them ennemies: wherfore the romayns made them redy with armour and weapen: to defende themselfe / and to resyst their ennemies: if nede shulde so requyre. A lytel feare was amonge them: but their hope and confort ouerpassed their feare. For why? they had the vp∣per hande before: and consydred that they shulde bycker with them whome they had often ouerthrowen and ouercome be∣fore. In the meane tyme the horsemen whiche were sent be∣fore of both parties to espy ye trueth of the mater / certified eche
of them that al thyng was quyet and sure ynough: as it was in dede: without treason or paryl. Volux in his metyng called Sylla by name: and welcomed hym benyngely / sayeng that he was sent from his father Bocchus to mete the sayd Sylla for his honour / socour / & defence. And so proceded they forthe¦warde al this day and the next day after in company togyder without feare or daunger. But after that it was nyght & their tentes pytched: sodenly the maurian Volux came rennyng to Sylla al pale & quakyng: and sayd that he was infourmed of the espyes / that Iugurth was nat far thens. And with that prayed & exhorted hym to fle away wt hym priuely by nyght. Sylla denyed that vtterly as fierse and bolde of courage / sayeng that he feared nat a cowarde numidyan: which so of∣ten had ben ouercome before. And that he trusted wel ynough to the strength & courage of his men: and finally he gaue Vo∣lux this answere. If I knewe without dout that our sure distruction were instāt: and that I and myne shuld be slayne in the felde / yet wold I nat fle for any drede: but rather abyde and dye manfully: than cowardely to flee & shame my people of whome I haue charge in sparyng our lyues / whiche be so incertayne & vnsure: and parauenture shortly after this shal fynisshe with some sickenes or dysease. Is it nat better to dye in a noble quarel manly / thā to lyue ī shame cowardly? Whan Sylla had thus answered: than Volux coūselled hym to de∣part from that place & to remoue forward by nyght. Therto Sylla cōsented: and anone cōmaunded his soudyours to re∣fresshe them in their tentes with such vitels as they had / and to make plenty of fiers ouer al the place to the intent that yf their ennemies were nere: in beholdyng the fiers they shulde thynke that they wolde nat remoue thens that nyght. But in the first hour of the night Sylla cōmaunded al his soudyors to leaue their fiers brennynge and so to depart forwarde in their iournay with scilence: so they dyd. And went al the night long: and euyn with the sonne rysinge they al beyng weryed: Sylla pytched his tentes agayne. With that certayne horse∣men of the mauriens brought word that Iugurth had taken place to his tentes: and rested about the distance of two myle before them. Whan these tidynges were harde among the ro∣mayns: a meruelous & great fear entred the myndes of them al. For they thought themselfe betrayed of Volux. And so en∣uyrounde with falshode & treason. Many aduysed to take pu¦nisshemēt of Volux: sayeng that it was a thyng vnworthy to suffre hym to escape vnpunysshed for so great a myschefe and treason agaynst them commytted. But howbeit that Sylla was inwardly of the same opynion: neuertheles he defended
the maurian from dammage. And exhorted his men to be of strong & bolde myndes: sayeng that often before that tyme it had ben sene that a fewe worthy men had won victory of a mo¦che multitude of coward{is}. And howe moch the lesse that they spared their bodyes in batayle fro fightyng: somoch the surer shuld they be: and that it semed no man to whome god & natu¦re had gyuen handes to defende his body: to sicke defence in his fete vnarmed by rennyng away. And that in suche a ieo∣pardy / a noble soudyour ought nat to tourne away his body from his ennemy / though he were naked and vnarmed. ¶Whan Sylla had exhorted his men with suche wordes: he called vnto hym Volux: and called in to wytnesse Iupyter and al his ydols to recorde the falshode and treason of Boc∣chus / father of Volux: which had so betrayed hym. Than for asmoch as Sylla supposed that Volux had brought hym by treason into handes of Iugurth by counsel & cōmaundement of his father Bocchus he cōmaunded Volux anone to depart from his cōpany syght / Volux pytuously wepyng: besought Sylla nat to byleue suche thing{is} in hym: & sayd that certenly by gyle nor by treason was nothyng done of him nor of his fa¦ther: but rather by Iugurth which by his subtilte had espyed & serched their iournay & wayes by his espies & so knowen the same. But at cōclusion said Volux: syth it is so that Iugurth hath no great cōpany & that his hope / his trust & confort for ye moost part dependeth on my father: I thinke that he shal nat be so bolde to do any damage to you openly whyle I am in your cōpany: which may recorde his ded{is} to my father. Wher¦fore Sylla to thentent that ye may parceyue that no treason is in me: I shal openly go with you alone by ye myddes of the tentes of Iugurth & so sauely conuey you: and other sēde my folke before: or els leaue thē hexe with your company whyther of both shal please you best. This coūsel was alowed of Syl¦la: & anone without tary he proceded forwarde with al his cō∣pany through myddes of the tentes of Iugurth. And bycause this was sodenly done: Iugurth nat knowyng therof before / he meruayled moch therat: & douted long what was to be do∣ne. But at last he suffred the romayns to passe & to escape sau∣fe and soūde for loue of Volux / and drede of Bocchus his fa∣ther. And within a fewe dayes after: Volux and Sylla with their company came to Bocchus: whether they intended. ¶Of the metyng and secrete apoyntmentes by∣twene Bocchus and Sylla: and howe bytwene them both they abused Asper / the imbassadour of Iu∣gurth. ¶The .lxiiii. chapyter.
AT the same season was with Boc¦chus a certayne numidyan named Asper / sende before Bocchus frō Iugurth / by craft and subtylte: to espy his coūsel / assone as it was hard that Bocchus had sende for Syl¦la. This numidyan was moch & familierly cōuersāt with Bocchus at that tyme. Mo∣reouer there was an other named Dabar the son of Massa∣grade: which of his fathers syde was of the stocke of Massi∣nissa. But of his mothers syde vnlyke of byrth: for his mother was borne of a cōcubine. This Dabar (as I haue sayd) was at this season also in the cōpany of Bocchus: and to hym dere and welbeloued for subtel wyt and great actes whiche he had done before: and namely bycause that Bocchus had founde & proued hym trusty & faythful many tymes before. Anone Boc¦chus sende this Dabar to Sylla commaundyng Dabar to shewe hym yt he was redy to do euery thyng which ye romains to hym wolde cōmaunde or assigne. And that Sylla hymself shuld apoynt / & chose a tyme & place where they might cōmen togyder of their maters: and that he shulde nat fere nor dout though the embassadoure of Iugurth were there with hym. For he had reserued all thyng{is} touchyng their coūsel hole tyll cōmyng of Sylla: & of nothyng had apoynted / cōmuned / nor cōcluded with the same imbassadour of Iugurth. Which im∣bassadour was called thyder to thyntent that their cōmen be∣synesses might be done more at lybertie & with lesse suspection of Iugurth: for by other meanes they coude nat resyst nor ma¦ke {pro}uision agaynst his gyles. Such wordes sende Bocchus to Sylla: by his trusty seruant Dabar. But natwtstandynge al these fayre promisses of Bocchus it was vnderstande yt he {pro}longed the romayns & the numidyans in hope of peace / ra∣ther for falshode & treason after the credēce of affrycans: than for profet to the romayns or trouth of such thyng{is} as he {pro}my∣sed to Sylla. And often tymes he cast in his mynde & douted whether he might betray Iugurth to ye romayns: or els Syl¦la to Iugurth: the pleasure & desyre of his mynd aduised / mo∣ued / & coūselled hym agaynst the romayns: but the drede whi¦che he had of punisshment in tyme to come: moued hym with ye romayns. But to our purpose: Sylla answered to Dabar the messanger of Bocchus that the wolde come thyder / & firste speke a lytel of the peace & of suche other thynges in presēce of Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth: but cōcernyng the reme∣nant of the besynesse: he wolde dyffer that to cōmen secretly wt Bocchus / fewe or none called to counsel. And also he taught Dabar what wordes Bocchus shulde answere vnto hym
agayne / whan they shulde come to cōmunicacion: and so de∣parted Dabar. But whan Sylla sawe his tyme he went to Bocchus / and sayd that he was sent from Marius the consul to enquire if he wold leuer peace or war: and wheron he wold cōclude. Than Bocchus (as Dabar had warned hym before) cōmaūded Sylla to retourne agayne afterd .x. dayes: and thā shulde an answere be gyuen vnto hym. For at that tyme no∣thyng was cōcluded. That answere wel noted & harde Asper the embassadour of Iugurth  whiche was sent to espy the in∣treatement: and so thought he that nothyng shulde be treated nor cōcluded without his knowlege. And thus after this an∣swere Bocchus and Sylla departed: eche to their tentes. ¶Of the seconde cōmyng togyder of Bocchus and of Sylla: and of the wordes of Bocchus had to Sylla: and replycation and answere of Sylla agayne to hym. And how Bocchus graunted & concluded to betray Iugurth to the romayns. ¶The .lxv. chapyter. BVt after that moche of the night was ouerpassed: Bocchus priuely sende for Sylla none beyng in their company / saue such as on both parties myght truely interprit and declare the sentence and vn∣derstandyng of their word{is}. And also Da∣bar the sayd messanger / was present whi∣che solemly swore and promised to be faythful interpretour of both their sayenges / and sentences. Than Bocchus anone began his wordes in this sentence. ¶I haue thought forsoth: that it shulde neuer haue fortuned that I the greattest kynge of al them in these landes: and ry∣chest of al them that I knowe: shuld haue ben bounde a mean & priuate person. And forsoth Sylla or euer I hard of you: I haue gyuen helpe & socours to many other men. To some of myne owne voluntary and frewyl. And to some other: re∣quired of them: my selfe nat nedyng helpe of any man. But now syth I haue knowen you: I haue nede of your helpe and frendshyp of which I am glad: nat withstandyng other men ar wont to be sory of such fortune. And certenly this nede whi¦che I haue of your frenshyp is nat of me counted damage nor losse: but moche profet and pleasure. For inwardly in my mynde nothyng is derer / nor more acceptable: whiche ye may
conueniently proue if it please you: demand & take of me ar∣mour / men / treasour: and finally what euer it pleaseth you in your mynde: and vse & occupy the same as your owne. And thynke ye for certayne that whyle ye lyue & I togyder: I can neuer render worthy thankes vnto your kyndnes: nor condi∣gnely recompence your great humanite: but euer my good wyl & mynde shalbe hole and newe agaynst you. And certenly if I may knowe your mynde & wyl: ye shal nought nede to de¦syre of me: I shal preuent your requestes with my benefytes: so that ye shal coueyt nothyng in vayne. Verely as I thynke it is lesse reprouable and lesse dyshonour a kyng to be ouercōe with armour: than with liberalite. Wherfore I haue conclu∣ded in mynde that a man shal rather ouercome me in batayle with weapen & force of armes: than with liberalite. ¶But touchyng your commen wayle (for whose besynes ye be sende hyther as procuratour of the same) this is my senten¦ce and mynde in fewe wordes. Agaynst the romayns / nor agaynst their empire: I neuer moued nor made war: nor to make batayle agaynst them: it was neuer ī my mynde by my wyl. But the boundys of my marchesse haue I endeuoured me to defende agaynst the violence of your armed men. But this I leaue & set a syde: syth I se that it pleaseth you to do the same: execute & continue ye batayle with Iugurth as ye wyl. And as touchyng me: I shal nat ouerpasse the water of Mu∣lucha / whiche was boundes bytwene my marches and Mi∣cipsa whyle he lyued. Nor into my countrey I shal nat suffre Iugurth from hens forthe: to entre for socours / as he hath done in tymes passed. Farthermore if ye desyre any thyng of me conueniently: which I may worthely graunt / my royalte nat distayned: it shal nat be denyed vnto you. Thus conclu∣ded Bocchus his wordes. ¶Vnto these wordes Sylla answered for his owne part but moderately and with fewe wordes. But touchyng the peace and besynesse concernyng the commen wayle: he spake many wordes / wherof the conclusion was suche. ¶Kynge Bocchus I insure and promesse you: that the ro∣mayns shal nat be vnkynde to you if ye do some pleasure to them: which may rather long to thē al holly in comen: than in me alone. And thynke ye for certayne: that they whiche haue ouercome you in batayle: shal lykewyse ouercome you wt libe¦ralite / kyndnesse / and good dedes: if ye so contende with thē: which thyng is nowe redy in your power to do: consydering that I haue Iugurth redy at your wyl and pleasure. Ther∣fore among al benefites or pleasurs: ye can do none more ac∣ceptable vnto the romayns: than to delyuer vnto theym Iu∣gurth.
By this meanes shal they be moche beholden to you: and thynke ye stedfastly: it shal nat be vnrewarded on our be∣halfe. For than shal the Senate graunt vnto you amyte and peace: and also a part of numidy whiche ye do nowe clayme: shul than be graunted vnto you vnrequired. ¶Bocchus heryng these wordes of Sylla: first excused him selfe by the affinyte whiche was bytwene hym and Iugurth: and by the longe familyarite & aquayntance whiche they had togyder: sayeng also that a bonde of peace was confyderate and sworne bytwene them. And also that he fered & suspected that if he so dyd: his owne subgett{is} shulde hate hym therfore whiche moche loued Iugurth: & greatly hated the romayns. But nat withstandyng these wordes of Bocchus: Sylla de∣systed nat to attyse and counsel hym: tyl at last he agreed and cōsented to his desyre / promysing to do euery thyng as Syl∣a requyred hym. But to thyntent to fayne a treaty of peace (of whiche Iugurth weryed in warre was moche desyrous) they ordayned suche craft: as to their purpose semed most ex∣pedyent. But whan they had ymagined and deuysed al thyn∣ges after theyr myndes: than both they departed in sonder: and retourned agayne to their rest. ¶Howe Bocchus betrayed Iugurth and dely∣uered hym bounde to Sylla. ¶The .lxvi. chap. ON the morowe after Bocchus called to hym Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth / and sayd to hym that he vnderstode of Sylly by the interpretacion of Dabar that the war might be inysshed vpon certayne cōdicions. Wherfore he bad hym go & inquire the mynde & pleasure of his kyng in yt behalfe. Asper of these tydynges was glad & toke hs leaue of Bocchus: and departed to the tentes of Iugurth: & certyfied hym of the same. Iugurth shewed to Asper: al his mynd and pleasure cōcerning the premisses. And within .viii. dayes aft sende hym agayne to Bocchus. Whan Asper was retourned agayne to Bocchus: he shewed to him ye wyl of Iugurth / say∣eng that he coueted to do althyng whiche shuld be cōmaūded to hym of Bocchus: but he had but smal cōfydēce in Marius. For asmoche as the peace whiche often before had ben conuē∣ted & apoynted of the romayne captayns had anone after ben frustrate: & broken of thē agayne. But if ye wyll (sayd Asper to Bocchus) that peace shalbe confermed of the romayns wt Iugurth & you also: Iugurth desyreth & requireth you to la∣bour so: that Sylla / Iugurth / & ye: may come togyder to cō∣munycation:
as if it were to treat of peace & that ye wyl there betraye and delyuer Sylla to hym. For if ye may ones bring such a man into power & handes of Iugurth: anone after it shall fortune without dowte that peace shalbe made and graū¦ted to him by cōmen assent of the senatours: & cōmens of Ro∣me also. And that: to thyntēt to recouer Sylla agayne out of the hādes of Iugurth. For without dout ye romayns wyl nat suffre so noble a man to be left in handes & danger of their en∣nemies. And namely: whan they shal vnderstande hym takē / nat by his owne folly nor cowardyse: but in besynesse belon∣gynge to the commen wayle. ¶Bocchus heryng these wordes: reuolued & cast lōg in min / de what he might answere to thē: but at last he graūted therto But whether he douted so long before he graūted for subtylte or very trouth / it is harde to discerne. But this is playnly knowen yt for the moost part in likewyse as the wylles & myn¦des of kyng{is} be vehemēt / immoderat / & hasty: right so be they mouyng / vnstedfast / & variable: and often aduers & cōtrary to their owne selfe: and with thēselfe repugnāt. But to our ma∣ter: Bocchus assigned to Asper a place & tyme: where Sylla and they shuld cōmen togyder of the peace. And in the meane whyle somtyme he cōmuned secretly with Sylla: somtyme wt Asper embassadour of Iugurth / treatyng them both mekely and courtesly: and {pro}misyng one self thyng vnto them both. Wherfore they both wer glad: and also eche of them both had good hope in the promysses of Bocchus. ¶But the nygh before that day: whiche was assigned to in∣treatmēt of the peace: Bocchus called vnto hym diuerse of his frendes / as if he wold haue taken coūsel of them: and than im∣mediatly he chaūged that mynde / cōmaundyng them agayne to auoyde from hym. And so (none of his coūsel about hym) he stode al alone reuoluyng & tourning ī mynde many thyng{is} by hymselfe / chaūgyng oftentymes in contenaūce / and colour variable & diuerse: aperyng forthward by tokens of feare cō∣ceyued in his mynde & expressed by outwarde tokens of his body. In so moche: that al yf he expressed nat his mynde by wordes: neuertheles this often changing of coūtenāce / decla∣red the secretes of his hert. But at cōclusion: after long cōfly had within hymselfe: at last he cōmaunded Sylla to be called vnto hym. And than aft his aduyse & coūsel he deuised & pre∣pared althyng{is} cōcernyng the prodicion of Iugurth. ¶After this coūsel cōcluded: assone as the day light apered▪ tidynges were brought to Bocchus / that Iugurth was nat far thens: and commynge towarde hym. Bocchus this he∣rynge: anone prepared hymselfe and proceded forth agaynst
hym accompanyed with a fewe of his frendes / and also with Sylla: fayninge that he went so forth to mete with Iugurth and to receyue hym / bycause of honour. And thus they proce∣ded forwarde: tyl at last they came to an opyn heyth / where they myght easely se the commyng of Iugurth: whiche place was apoynted before to their treason. For in dyuerse valeys of the same heyth: were armed men lyenge in wayt redy and apoynted before by Bocchus: for to assayle Iugurth and his company / whan signes shuld be gyuen to them: to yssue forth of their lurkyng places. Anone Iugurth with many of his men about hym came to ye same place al vnarmed: as apoynte¦ment was made before. For it was ordayned that Bocchus / Iugurth / and Sylla: shulde come togyder to cōmunicacion: eche one with a smal company / and al vnarmed. ¶Anon as Iugurth was come thyder: kyng Bocchus gaue a token to his men / which lay in wayt for Iugurth. Anone as they harde the token: sodaynly they bracke forth and inuaded Iugurth and his cōpany: compasynge them about on euery syde. Without great labour: al the company of Iugurth were murdred: and he hymselfe taken and bounde hande and fote / and so delyuerd vnto Sylla: whiche without tary led hym forth and delyuerd hym vnto Marius: whose hert was re∣plenysshed and inuironed / with ioye inestimable. ¶How Marius was receyued into Rome with triumphe: and howe Iugurth was cast into prison: where he contynued in myse∣rable captiuite tyl he dyed. ¶The .lxvii. cha. AFter that Iugurth thus bounde was delyuered by Bocchus vnto Sylla: and than to Marius. Anone al the numi∣dyans / submytted and yelded themselfe to the romayns. Marius with great wyse∣dome set an order among the people / and garnysshed and fortified the townes: and than with the remanent of his army toke his iournay agayne to Rome: leadyng Iugurth and his two sonnes bounde with hym: with innumerable other prisoners / great treasour / oly∣phantes / and armoure: whiche he had won in the war of Iu¦gurth. But after that tidynges were brought to Rome: howe the war was ended in Numidy: and howe Iugurth was
led thyderwarde bounde and prisoner. Anone the Senate and commens assembled to counsel: and Marius was create consul agayne for the next yere: in his absence. And by decre and ordynaunce: the prouince of Fraunce was commytted vnto hym to be recouered. ¶For the same tyme whyle Marius warred in Numidy: and toke Iugurth prisoner. That coūtrey of France (whose people that tyme were named Cymbrians) rebelled agaynst the empyre of Rome. Agaynst whome the romayns sende forth to represse their rebellion: a great army with two ca∣pitayns: the one named Quintus Scipio / the other Mar∣cus Manlyus: whiche at last with frowarde fortune had a great and greuous batayle with the same frenchmen Cym∣brians. In which both these romayne capitayns were ouer∣come· and twyse lost the felde. Of the romayns men of war: were slayne .lxxx. thousande: of tylmen / and pages .xl. thou∣sande. Thus was this batayle foughten with so yl fortune vnto the romayns: that the cite of Rome / and al the countrey of Italy trembled for feare therof. In somoche that both the romains which lyued at that tyme: and al their progeny whi∣che succeded them: counted al other nacions redy to their obe∣sance: and to wyn honour by them: but they thought neuer to contende in batayle with this nacion of frenchmen: to wynne glorie or honour by them: but rather to defende themselfe and their libertie: whiche thynge if they myght do / they counted themselfe fortunate. Wherfore (as I haue before recounted) the Senate: and commens of Rome / decreed this prouince of France to Marius for to reuenge the deth of their men: and to recouer the countrey. ¶But (to our purpose) whan Marius shulde intre into Ro¦me he was ioyfully receyued with great glorie and triumphe: wherof the order was suche. Marius hymselfe was set on hye in a golden chayre: whiche was drawen of foure whyte palfrayes. Iugurth and his two sonnes / with many other noble men: whome he brought captyue from Numidy / proce∣ded before his chariot: their handes and armes bounde as pri¦soners. Fathermore for more ample ostentacion of his glorie / and to declare howe moche he had inryched the cōmen wayle of Rome: al the elyphantes / armour / iewels / treasur / and ry∣chesse whiche he had won in Numidy of Iugurth: were led and borne before hym. Than al the senatours: al the officers and noble men of Rome / with an vnnumerable multtude of commens receyued hym with al honoure and ioye: and con∣uayed hym vnto the prinipal palayes of Rome / named the Capytol: where he made sacrifice with a bul vnto Iupiter:
for his victory: after the custome of that tyme. His sacrifice ended: than was he conuayed into the Senate house / in his robe triumphal: as neuer cōsul was brought before his tyme. Marius was receyued at Rome with suche triumphe at the kalendes of Ianuary. From thensforth al the hop of confort / helth / socors / & welth of the cite of Rome resisted in Marius. ¶Iugurth was casten into prison: where he ended his wret∣ched lyfe in myserable captiuyte / and many∣folde calamitees / as to such a murde∣rer vnnatural: and tran inhumayne was conueny∣ent. FINIS. ¶Thus endeth the famous cronycle of the war whiche the romayns had agaynst Iugurth vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy: which cronycle is cōpyled in laten by the renowmed romayn Sa∣lust. And translated into englysshe by syr Ale∣xander Barclay preest: at com∣maunde∣ment of the right hye and mighty prince / Tho∣mas duke of Northfolke. And impren∣ted at London by Richarde Pynson printer vnto the kynges noble gra∣ce: with priuylege vnto hym graunted by our sayd so∣uerayne lorde the kynge.

Igitur amicitia Massinissae bo¦na at{que} honesta nobis {per}māsit. Sed imperij vi∣tae{que} eius finis idē fut.
Deinde Micipsa filius regnum solus obtinu∣it Manastabale et Ga∣lussa fratribus morbo absumptis. Is Adher∣balem et Hiempsalem ex se genuit: Iugurthā{que} filiū Manastabalis quē Massinissa ({quod} or∣tus ex cōcubina erat) priuatū reliquerat: eo dem cultu quo liberos suos domi habuit. Qui vbi primū adole∣uit pollēs viribus, de∣cora facie, sed multo maximo ingenio vali∣dus: non se luxui, ne{que} inertiae corrūpendum dedit, sed vti mos illi∣us est gētis: equitare, iaculari, cursu cum ae∣qualib{us} certare, et cū gloria ante om̄es iret: oībus tamē charus es∣se: ad hoc plera{que} tem∣pora in venādo agere. Leonem at{que} alias fe∣ras primus, aut in pri∣mis fere, plurimū fa¦cere: et minimum de se ipse loqui. Quibus re∣bus Micipsa tametsi ī initio laetus fuerat ex¦stimans virtutem Iu∣gurthae regno suo glo∣riae a fore: tamen post{quam} hominē adolescentem exacta aetate sua, et {per}∣uis liberis, magis, ma¦gis  crescere intelli∣git vehemēter eo nego¦cio {per}motus in animo multa voluebat. Terreba eum natura
mortaliū auida imperij▪ et preceps ad explendam animi cupidinem. Praeterea oportunitas su¦e liberorum{que} aetatis: quae etiā mediocres viros spe¦prede transuersos agit. Adhoc studia Numidarū in Iugurtham accensa. Ex quibus si talē virū do lis īterfecisset / nequa se∣ditio / aut bellū oriretur / anxius erat. His difficul tatibus circumuentus: vbi videt / ne{que} per vim / ne{que} per insidias / opprimi posse hominem tam acce¦ptū popularibus: {quod} erat Iugurtha manu prompt{us} et appetens gloriae mili∣taris: statuit eum obiecta re periculis, et eo modo fortunam tentare. Igitur bello Numantino Micipsa quum populo ro¦mano equitū / at{que} peditū auxilia mitteret: sperans vel ostēdendo virtutē: vel hostū seuitia: acile eum occasurū: prefecit Numi¦di, quos in Hispaniam mittebat. Sed ea res lōge aliter, ac ratus erat, euenit. Nam Iugurtha (vt erat ipgio at{que} acri ingenio) Vbi na¦turam Publij Scipionis, qui tū Roman{us} im{per}ator erat: et mores hostiū co∣gnoui, multo labore, mul¦ta{que} cura, praeteea mode stiime paēdo: saepe obui¦am ūdo periculis: in tan¦tā claritudinē breui {per}ue∣nerat, vt nostris vehemē∣ter charus, Numantinis maxime terrori esset. At san  quod difficillimū . in primis et p̄lio strnu erar: et bon{us} cōsili: quo∣rum alterum ex prouidē∣tia
timorē: alterū ex au∣datia temeritatem ple∣rum{que} afferre solet. Igitur imperator omnes fere res asperas per Iu∣gurtham agere: in amicis habere: magis magis{que} eū indies amplecti. Quippe cuius consilium: ne{que} inceptum ullum fru∣stra erat. Huc accedebat munificentia animi et in∣genij solertia▪ quibus re∣bus Iugurtha multos ex Romanis sibi familiari amicitia cōiunxerat. Ea tēpestate in exercitu no∣stro fuere {quam} plures noi / at{que} nobiles / quibus diui∣tiae bono / at{que} honesto / po¦ciores erant: factiosi do∣mi: potentes apud socio: ciari magis quā honesti: qui Iugurthae nō medio∣crem animū pollicitādo accendebant Si Micipsa rex occidisset: fore vt so∣lus imperio Numidiae po¦tiretur. In ipso maximā virtutem. Romae omnia ven alia esse. SEd postquam Numā∣tia deleta▪ Publi{us} Sci¦podimittere auxilia et ipse reuerti domum de¦creuit: donatū / at{que} lau∣datū magnifice pro cōci∣one Iugurthā ī pretoriū adduxit: ibi{que} secreto mo nur: vt potius publice / {quam} priuatim amicitiā popu∣li Romani coleret. Neu aliquibus largiri insue∣sceret. Periculose a pau∣cis emi: quod multorum esset.
Si permanere vellet ī su¦is artib{us}: vltro et illi glo¦riam / et regnū venturū: Sin properantius perge∣ret suam pecuniam et ip∣sum precipitem casurū. Sic locutus: cum literis eum (quas Micipsae redde¦ret) dimisit. Earum sententia haec erat. IVgurthae tui in bello Numantino longe ma¦xima virtus fuit. Quam rem tibi certe gau¦dio esse scio. Nobis ob merita sua charus est: vt idem senatui et populo Romano sit: summa ope nitemur. Tibi quidem pro nr̄a ami¦citia gratulor. En habes virum dignū te at{que} auo suo Massinissa.
IGitur rex vbi ea quae fama cceperat: ex lit∣teris imperatoris esse ita cognouit: tum virtu∣te, tum gratia viri permo¦tus flexit animum suum. t Iugurtham beneficijs vincere aggressus est. Statim{que} eum adoptauit: et testamento pariter cū filijs haeredem instituit. Sed ipse paucos post an∣nos morbo / at{que} aetate cō∣fectus: cum sibi finem vi∣te adesse intelligeret: co∣ram amicis / et cognatis: item{que} Adherbale et Hi∣emsale filijs, dicitur hu∣iuscemodi verba cum Iu∣gurtha habuisse. PAruū ego Iugurtha te amisso patre: sine spe: sine opibus: in meum regnū suscepi: ex∣istimans non minus me tibi: {quam} liberis (si genu∣issem) ob beneficia cha∣rum fore. Ne{que} ea res falsum me ha¦buit. Nam vt alia magna et egregia facta omittā)
nouissime tu rediens Nu mancia me{que}, regnum{que} meum gloria decorasti: tua{que} virtute Romanos ex amicis amicissimos fe cisti. In Hispania nomē fami∣liae nostre renouatum est: postremo (quod difficili∣mum inter mortales est) gloria inuidiam vicisti. Nunc (quoniam mihi na∣tura finem vitae facit) per hanc dexteram: per regni fidem moneo: obtestor{que} te: vti hos qui genere tibi propinqui beneficio meo fratres sunt: charos ha∣beas. Neu malis alienos adiū∣gere: q̄ sanguine coniun∣ctos retinere. Non exercitus / ne{que} the∣sauri presidia regni sūt. Verum amici, quos ne{que} armis cogere, ne{que} auro parare queas: officio et fi de pariuntur. Quis autem amicitior {quam} frater fratri? Aut quem alienum fidm inuenies: si tuis hostis fueris▪ Equidē ego vobis regnū trado firmum / si boni eri∣tis: sin mali imbecillum. Nam cōcordia paruae res crescunt, discordia maxi¦me dilabuntur. Caeterum Iugurtha ante hos te (quia aetate et sapi entia priores) ne aliter quid eueniat prouidere decet.
Nam in omni certamine qui opulentior est: etiam si accipit iniuriam tamē (quia plus potest) facere videtur. Vos autem Adherbal et Hiempsal colite et obser¦uate hunc talem virum: imitamini virtutem: et enitmini: ne ego melio∣res liberos sumpsisse vi∣dear: {quam} genuisse. Ad ea Iugurtha tametsi regem ficta locutum intel¦ligebat: et ipse longe ali∣ter in animo agitabat, ta¦men pro tempore beni∣gne respondit. Micipsa paucis post die∣bus moritur. Post{quam} illi regio more iu∣sta magnifice fecerāt: re∣guli in vnum conueniūt: vt inter se de cūctis nego tijs disceptarent. Sed Hiempsal, qui mini∣mus ex illis erat: natura ferox: etiam antea igno∣bilitatem Iugurthae: quia materno genere impar erat: despiciens: dextera Adherbalē assedit, ne me∣di ex tribus (quod apud Numidas honori ducit) Iugurtha foret▪
Deinde tamen vt aetati cōcederet / fatigatus a fra¦tre: vix in partem alterā traductus est. Ibi cum multa de admi∣nistrando imperio dissere rēt: Iugurtha inter alias res ait: oportere quīquen nij cōsulta et decreta oīa rescindi. Nam per ea tempora cō∣fectum annis Micipsam parum animo valuisse. Tum Hiāpsal placere si∣bi respondit: nam ipsum illum his tribus proxi∣mis annis adoptione in regnum peruenisse. Quod verbum in pectus Iugurthae altius {quam} quis{quam} ratus erat descendit. Ita{que} ex eo tempore ira / et metu anxius: moliri / parare / at{que} ea modo ī a∣nimo habere: quibus Hi∣empsal per dolum capere¦tur. Que vbi tardi{us} proce¦dūt: ne{que} lenitur animus ferox: statuit quouis mo∣do inceptum perficere. Primo cōuentu: quem ab

Sed Hiempsal in oppido Thirmida forte eius domo vtebatur / qui proxim{us} lictor Iugurthae: charus / acceptus{que} ei sem per fuerat. Quem ille ca∣su ministrum oblatū pro∣missis onerat / impellit{que}: vti tan{quam} suam visens do∣mum eat▪ portarū claues adulterinas paret. Nam vere claues ad Hi∣empsalem referebantur. Caeterum (vbi res postula ret) seipsum cum magna manu venturum. Numida mandata breui confecit.
At{que} (vti doctus erat) no∣ctu Iugurthae milites in∣troducit. Qui post{quam} in aedes irrupere: diuersi re∣gem querebant: dormiē∣tes alios: alios occursā∣tes interfecere. Scrutari loca abdita: clausa affrīgere: strepitu et tumultu oīa miscere. Quum interī Hiempsal reperitur / occultans se in tugurio mulieris ancille: quo in initio pauidus: et loci ignarus {per}fugerat. Numide caput eius (vti nissi erant) referunt. Cae∣terū fama tanti facino∣ris per omnem Aphricā breui deuulgatur. Adher balē omnes{que} qui sub im∣perio Micipsae fuerāt / me¦tus inuadit. In duas par∣tes Numide discedunt. Plures Adherbalem se∣quuntur Sed illum alte∣rum bello meliores. Igitur Iugurtha / quā ma¦ximas potest copias pa∣rat: vrbes partim vi: ali∣as voluntate: im{per}io suo adiungere: Omni Numi∣diae imperare. Adherbal (tametsi lega∣tos Romam miserat: qui senatum docerent de ce∣de fratris: et fortunis su∣is) tamen fretus multitu¦dine militum parat ar∣mis contendere.
SEd vbi res ad certa∣men venit: victus ex prelio profugit ī pro∣uinciam. Ac dehinc Romam con∣tendit. Tum Iugurtha peractis consilijs / post{quam} omni Nu∣midia pociebatur: ī ocio facinus suum ī animo re∣putās: timere populū ro∣manū: ne{que} aduersus irā eius vs{quam}▪ nisi in auaricia nobilitatis: et pecunia sua spem habere. Ita{que} paucis diebus post / cū auro et argēto multo Romam legatos mittit: quibus precepit primum vti veteres amicos mune¦ribus repleant: deinde no¦uos exquirant. Postremo quaecun{que} possint largien¦do ne cunctentur. Sed vbi legati Romam venere: et ex praecepto re¦gis hospitib{us} alijsq▪ quo rū ea tempestate in sena∣tu authoritas pollebat: magna munera misere:
Tanta commutatio in∣cessit: vt ex maxima inui¦dia et maliuolētia in gra¦tiam et fauorem nobili∣tatis Iugurtha veniret. Quorū pars spe / alij pre∣mio inducti: singlos ex se∣natu ambiendo niteban∣tur: ne grauis in cum con¦suleretur. Igitur vbi le∣gati satis confidunt: die cōstituto▪ senatus vtris{que} datur. Tum Adherbalem hoc modo locutum accepi∣mus. PAtres conscripti Mi∣cipsa paer meus mo¦riens pacepyt re∣gni Numidae tantūmo∣do procurationem existi∣marem meam▪ Caeterum ius et imperium eius pe∣nes vos esse populum{que} romanum▪ simul enitere vobis domi militiae{que} {quam} maximo vsui esse: vos mi∣hi cognatorū et affinium loco ducerē.

Quae praecepta patris cū agitaem: Iugurtha (ho∣mo oīum: quos terra su∣stinet: sceleratissimus) cō∣tempto vestro imperio / Massinissae me nepotem / a stirpe socium at{que} amicū populi romani: regno / for runis{que} omnibus expulit. At{que} ego patres cōscripti (quoniam eo miseriarum vēturus eram) vellem po tius ob mea {quam} ob maiorū beneficia meorum▪ posse me auxilium a vobis pe∣tere: ac maxim deber mihi beneficia a populo romano quibus vtinam non egerem. Sed si ea desiderāda erāt vti debitis vterer. Sed quoniam parū tuta {per} seipā probitas est: ne{que} mihi in manu fuit: qualis foret Iugurtha: ad vos cō¦fugi patres cōscripti: qui bus (quod mihi miserri∣mum est) cogor prius one ri {quam} vsui esse. Caeteri reges aut bello vi¦cti in amicitiam recepti sunt: aut in suis du bijs re¦bus societatem vestram appetiuerunt. Familia nostra cū populo romano bello Carthagi∣nēsi amicitiam instituit. Quo tempore: magis fi∣des eius {quam} fortuna peten¦da erat. Quorum progeniem vos patres conscripti nolite pati me nepotem Massi∣nissae frustra auxilium pe¦tre. Sed si ad impetran∣dum nihil causae haberem
praeter miserandam fortu¦nam abquod; paulo āte ego rex genere, fama, at{que} copijs potens: nunc deformatus erumnis: inops alienas o∣pes expecto. Tamen erat magestatis populi roma∣ni prohibere iniuriā ne{que} pati cuius{quam} regnum par scelus crescere. Verū ego his finibus eie∣ctus sum: quos maiorib{us} meis populus roman{us} de dit: vnde pater et auus meus vna vobiscum ex∣pulere Siphacem et Car∣thaginenses▪ vestra bene∣ficia mihi erepta sūt▪ pa∣tres conscripti in mea in∣iuria despecti estis. Heu me miserū. Huccine Mi∣cipsa pater beneficiatua euasere▪ Vt quem tu pa∣rem cum liberis uis, re∣gni{que} participem fecisti: is potissimum stirpis tue extinctor sit. Nun{quam} ne er∣go familia nostra quieta erit? Semper ne ī sangui∣ne, ferro, fuga versabi∣mur? Dum Carthaginen∣ses incolumes fuere iure omnia seua patiebamur: hostes a latere. Vos ami∣ci procul. Sed omnis in armis. Post{quam} illa pestis ex Aphrica eiecta est: leti pa¦cem agitabamus: quippe quibus nullus hostis erat nisi illi forte quem vos iussissetis. Ecce autem ex improuiso: Iugurtha in∣tollerāda audacia, scele∣re, at{que} superbia sese effe¦rens: ratre meo at{que} eo∣dem propinquo suo inter¦fecto primum regnū eius sceleris sui predam fecit.
Post vbi in eisdem dolis me nequiuerit capere: ni∣hil minus {quam} vim aut bel∣lum expectātem in impe∣rio vestro (sicut videtis) extorrem patria, domo ī∣opem et coopartū mise∣rijs effecit: vt vbiuis tu∣ti{us} {quam} in meo regno essem. Ego sic existimabam pa∣tres conscripti vti predi¦cantem audiuerā patrem meū qui diligenter cole∣rent amicitiam vestram: eos multū laborem susci∣pere, caeterū ex omnibus maxime tutos esse. Quod in familia nr̄a fuit praestitit, vti in omnibus bellis adesset vobis. Nos vti per ocium tuti simus in manu vestra est. Patres conscripti pater nos duos fratres reliquit ertium Iugurthā bene∣ficijs suis ratus est con∣iunctum nobis fore. Alter eorum necatus est, alter ei{us} ipse ego manus impias vix effugi. Quid agam? aut quo po∣rissimū infelix accedam? Generis oīa presidia ex∣tincta sunt. Pater vti ne∣cesse erat naturae cōcessit. Fratri quem minime de∣cuit propinquus per sce∣lus vitam eripuit affines, amicos caeteros{que} meos propinquos aliū alia cla¦de oppressit.
Pars capti a Iugurtha, pars in crucem acti, et pars bestijs obiecti sunt. Pauci (quibus relicta est anima) clausi in tenebris: cum merore et luctu mor¦te grauiorem vitam exi∣gunt. Sed si oīa mihi quae aut amisi, aut quae ex ne∣cessarijs aduersa facta sūt incolumia manerent: ta∣men si quid ex improuiso mali accidisset vos implo rarem patres conscripti quibus pro magnitudine īperij ius et iniurias oēs cure esse decet.

An quo{quam} mihi adire licet vbi non meorū ma∣iorum monumento hosti∣lia plurima sint. An quis{que} nostri misereri potest qui aliquando no∣bis hostis fuit? Postremo Micipsa ita nos instituit patres cōscripti ne quem coleremus nisi populum romanū: ne so∣cietatem, ne{que} federa no∣ua acciperemus: abunde magna presidia nobis in vestra amicitia fore. Sed si huic imperio fortuna mutaretur: vna occiden∣dum nobis fore. Virtute ac dijs volētibus magni et opulenti estis. Oīa secūda et obedientia sūt: quo facili{us} sociorum iniurias curare licet.
Tantum illud vereor ne quos priuata amicitia Iu¦gurthae parum cognita trāsuersos agat: quos ego audio sūma ope niti / am∣bire fatigare vos singu∣los: ne quid de absēte (in∣cognita causa) statuatis.

Mau∣ris oībus im{per}itabat rex Bocch{us} praeter nomē per caetera ignar{us} populo ro∣mano. item{que}, ne{que} pace, ne{que} bello ante cognitus erat. De Aphrica et de e∣iusdem incolis ad necessi tudinē rei satis dictū est. POst{quam} autem diuiso re¦gno legati ab Aphri∣ca discessere: et Iugur¦tha cōtra animi timorem premia sceleris adeptum sese videt: certum esse ra∣tus quod ex amicis apud Numantiam acceperat, oīa Romae venalia esse: si∣mul et illorum pollicita∣tionibus accensus: quos paulo ante munerib{us} ex∣pleuerat: in regnum Ad∣herbalis animū intēdit. Ipse acer bellicosus. At is quem petebat: quietus imbellis, placido īgenio, oportunus iniurie, me∣tuēs magis {quam} metuēdus.
Igitur Iugurtha ex im∣prouiso eius fines cū ma∣gna manu inuadit: mul∣tos mortales cum pecore at{que} alia preda capit: edi∣ficia incendit: plera{que} lo∣ca hostiliter cum equita∣tu petit. Deinde cū omnium mul∣titudine in regnū suum cōuertit: existimans Ad∣herbalem dolore {per}motū iniurias suas vindicatu∣rum eam{que} rem belli cau∣sam fore. At ille: {quod} ne{que} se parem armis existima∣bat: et amicitia populi ro mani magis {quam} Numidis fretus erat: legatos ad Iu¦gurtham de iniurijs que∣stum misi: qui tametsi cō∣tumeliosa dicta retulerūt prius tamen omnia pati decreuit {quam} bellum sume∣re quia tentatum ante se∣cus cessert. Ne{que} eo magis cupido Iu¦gurthae minuebatur. Quippe qui totū regnum ei{us} animo iam inuaserat▪ Ita{que} non vti ante cū pre datoria manu: sed magno exercitu comparato bel∣lum gerere cepit: et toti{us} imparium Numidiae pe∣tere: caeterum qua perge∣bat: vrbes, agros vastare: predas agere: suis animū: hostibus terrorem auge∣re. Adherbal vbi intelle∣xit eo processum: vti re∣gnum aut reliquendum esset: aut armis retinen∣dum
necessario copias pa¦rat et Iugurthae obuius procedit. Interim haud longe amari prope Cir∣tham oppidum vtrius{que} exercitus cōsedit et quia diei extremum erat: pre∣lium non est inceptū: sed vbi plurimum noctis pro∣cessit: obscuro etiam tunc lumine: milites Iugurthi ni signo dato castra hosti∣um inuadunt: semisōnos partim alios sumētes ar∣ma sugāt sundunt{que}. Ad∣herbal cum paucis equiti¦bus Cirtham profugit: et ni multitudo togatorum fuisset: quae Numidas in∣sequentes menibus pro∣hibebat: vno die inter du¦os regos ceptum at{que} pa∣tratum bellum forer. Iugurtha oppidum circū sedit: vineas, turribus{que} et machinis omnium ge∣nerum expugnare aggre∣ditur: maxime festinans tempus legatorum ante capere quos ante preliū factum ab Adherbale ro∣mam missos audiuerat. SEd post {quam} senatus de bello eorum accepit: tres adolescentes in Aphricā legātur: qui am∣bos reges adeant senatus populi{que} romani vrb{is} nū∣ciēt censere et velle: eos
armis discedere, ita se{que}, illis{que} dignum esse. Lega ti in Aphricam maturan∣tes veniunt, eo magis / {quod} Romae, quum proficisci parant, de prelio facto et oppugnatione Cirthae au¦diebatur. Sed rumor clemens erat. Quorum Iugurtha acce∣pta oratione respondit, sibi ne{que} mai quic{quam}, ne{que} charius authoritate se∣natus esse: ab adolescen∣tia ita se enixum: vt ab optimo quo{que} probart. Virtute, non malitia Pu∣blio Scipioni summo vi∣ro placuise, ob easdem artes a Micipsa non penu¦ria liberorum in egnum adoptatum esse. Caeterum {quod} plera{que} bene at{que} strennue fecisset, eo aīm suū iniuriam minus tollerare. Adherbalem do lis vitae suae insidiatū esse: quod vbi comperisset: sce¦leri obuiam isse. Populum romanum ne{que} recte, ne{que} pro bono fact∣rum: si a iure gētium sese prohibuerit. Postremo de omnibus re∣bus legatos Romam bre∣ui misurum Ita vtri{que} d grediuntur. Adherbali modo fuit ap∣pellandi copia.
Iugurtha vbi eos Aphri∣ca discessisse rat{us} est ne{que} propter loci naturam ar∣mis expugnare Cirtham potest: vallo at{que} fossa me∣nia circundat, turres ex∣truit, eas{que} presidijs fir∣mat. Praeterea dies noctesque aut per vim, aut dolis tē∣tare: defēsoribus moeniū praemia modo: modo for∣midinem ostentare suos hortādo ad virtutem eri∣gere / prorsus intētus cun∣cta parare. At vbi Adherbal intelli∣git omnes fortunas suas in extremo sitas: hostem infestū: auxilij spem nul∣lam penuia necessaria{rum} rerum bellum trahi non posse: ex his, qui vna Cir∣tham profugerant, duos
maxime impigros dele∣git: eos multa pollicendo ac miserando casum suū cōfirmat: vti per hostium munitiōes noctu ad pro∣ximum mare, deinde Ro¦mam pergerent. Numidae paucis diebus iussa efficiunt. Litterae Adherbalis in se∣natu recitate sunt, qua∣rum sentētia haec erat. NOn mea culpa saepe ad vos oratum mit∣to patres cōscripti, sed vis Iugurthae subegit: quem tanta libido extin∣guendi me inuasit: vt ne{que} vos, ne{que} deos immorta∣les in aio habeat. Sangui¦nem meum {quam} oīa malit. Ita{que} iam quintū mēsem socius, et amicus populi romani armis obsesus te¦neor, ne{que} Micipsa patris mei beneficia, ne{que} vestra decreta auxiliantur. Ferro an fame acrius vr∣gear incertus sum. Plura de Iugurtha scribe¦re dehortatur me fortu∣na mea: etiam ante exper¦tus sum parum fidei mise¦ris esse, tamen intelligo
illum supra {quam} ego sum pe¦tere. Ne{que} simul amiciciā vestram et regnum meum sperare utrū grauius exi¦stimet nemini occultū est. Nam ī initio occidit Hi∣empsalem fratrem meū. Deinde patrio regno me expulit. Que sane fuerit nr̄e iniurie: nihil ad vos. Verum nunc regnum ar∣mis tenet. Me quem vos im{per}atorem numidis po∣suistis clausum obsidet: legatorum verba quanti fecerit: pericula mea de∣clarant. Quid reliquum nisi vis vestra qua moueri possit Nam ego quidem vellem hec que scribo et illa quae antea in senatu questus sum vana forent: potius {quam} miseria mea fidem vo∣bis faceret: sed quoniam in eo natus sū: vt Iugur∣thae scelerum ostentui es∣sem. Non iam mortē nec erumnas tantūmodo im∣{per}ium inimici et cruciat{us} corporis dep̄cor. Regno Numidiae patres conscri∣pti quod vestrum est: vti libet consulite me mani∣bus ab impijs eripite per magestatem imperij: per amicitiae fidē: si vlla apud vos memoria manet aui mei Massinissae.
HIs literis recitatis fuere qui exercitū ī Aphricam mitten∣dum decernerent: {quam} pri∣mum Adherbali subueni endum. interim de Iugur¦tha consuleretur quoniā legatis non paruisset. sed ab ijsdem regis fautori∣bus summa ope enixum est ne tale decretum fie∣ret: ita bonum publicum (vt pleris{que} negotijs so∣let) priuata gratia deui∣ctum. Legantur tamen in Aphricā maiores natu / nobiles amplis honori∣bus vsi: in quis fuit Mar∣cus Emilius Scaurus de quo supra memorauim{us}: homo cōsularis: & tum in senatu potens princeps. Hi {quod} Iugurthae res in in∣uidia erat: simulet a Nu∣midis obsecrati: triduo ī nauem ascendere. Dein∣de breui Vticam appulsi literas ad Iugurthā mit∣tunt {quam} ocissime ad prouī∣ciam accedat: se{que} ad eum ab senatu missos.
assumitur Scaurus: qui ta metsi a principio pleris{que} aex factione ei{us} corruptis acerrime regē impugna∣bat: n̄ magnitudine pecu¦niae a bono honesto{que} in praum abstractus est. Sed Iugurtha primū bel∣li tantūmodo moram re∣dime bat: existimans sese aliquid interim Romae preci o aut gratia effe∣cturum. Postea vero {quam} participem negocij Scau¦rum accepit: ī maximam spem adductus recuperan de pacis: statuit cū eis de omnibus pactionibus pre¦sens agere. Caeterū interea fidei cau∣sa mittitur a cōsule Sex∣tius questor in oppidum Iugurthae Vaccam: cuius rei species erat acceptio srumenti: quod Calphur∣nius palam legatis impe∣rauerat: quoniā deditio∣nis mora inducie agita∣bantur. Igitur rex (vti constitue∣rat) in castra perueuit ac pauca presenti cōsilo lo∣cutus de inuidia facti sui at{que} vti ī deditionem ac∣ciperetur: reliqua cū Bestia et Scau¦o secreto transegit.
Deinde postero die quasi per satyram legem sentē tijs exquisitis in deditio∣nem accipitur: Sed vti pro consilio im{per} atum erat: eliphante / tri∣ginta pecus / atque equi multi non cum paruo ar∣genta pondere questori traduntur. Calphurnius romam ad magistratus rogādos pro¦ficiscitur. In Numidia et in exerci tu nostro pax agitabat. POst{quam} autem rs in A∣phrica gestas et quo∣modo acte forent fa∣ma diuulgauit. Rome {per} omnis locos et conuent{us} de facto consulis agitari: apud plebem grauis inui¦dia orta est. Patres solici ti erant an probarent tā∣tum flagitium an decre∣tum
cōsulis subuerterēt: parum constabat. At ma∣xime eos potentia Scau∣ri {quod} is auctor et socius Bestie ferebat a vero bo∣no{que} impediebat. At Caius Mēmius: de cu∣ius libertate ingenij / et odio potētie nobilitatis supra diximus inter du∣bitationem: et moras se natus in concionibus po∣pulum ad vendicandum hortari: monere populū romanum ne libertatem suam desererent: crude∣lia et superba multa faci∣nora nobilitatis ostende∣re: prorsus intentus om∣nino plebis animum ac∣cendebat. Sed quoniam ea tēpesta∣te Rome Memmij facun∣dia clara / pollens que fu∣it decere existimaui vnā (ex tā multis) orationem eius perscribere: ac potis∣simum eam dicam quā in cōcione post reditum be∣stie huiuscemodi verbis disseruit. MVlta me dehortant a vobis quirites: ni si studium rei publi¦cae omnia superet: opes fa¦ctionis: vestra patientia: ius nullum: ac maxime {quod} innocentie plus periculi {quam} honoris est.
Nam illā quidem piget dicere: his annis quinde∣cim {quam} ludibrio fueritis su perbie paucorum {quam} fed {quam}que multi perierunt ve¦stri defēsores vt nobis a∣nimus ab ignauia atque secodia corruptus sit: qui ne nūc quidē obnoxij inimicis exurgitis. Atque etiam nunc time∣tis eos: quibus terrori de¦cet esse. Sed {quam}{quam} haec falia sunt: tamen obuam ire potentie factionis anim{us} subegit. Certe ego libertatē que mihi aparēte meo tradi∣ta est experiar. Verum d frustra / an ob rem faciā / in vestra manu situm est. Neque vos hortor quod saepe vestri maiores fece∣re uti contra iniurias ar∣mati eatis: nihil vi nec secessione opus est: neces∣se est suomet ipsi more p̄∣cepites eant. Occiso Tiberio Graccho (quem regnū parare ho∣mines aebant) in plebē romanam graues habite sūt quaestiones. Post Caij Gracch et Marci Fuluij cedem: item vestri ordi∣nis multi mortales ī car∣cere necati sunt. Vtrius∣que cladis non lex verū

Sed sane suerit regni re paratio plebi sua ura re stituere quicquid sine sā∣guine cuium vlcisci ne∣quit ine actum sit▪ Superioribus annis taci ti indignabamini erariū expilari: reges et popu∣los liberos paucis nobili bus veigal pendere pe∣nes eosdem et sūmam glï am et maximas diuitias esse t talia facinora im∣pune suscepisse parum ha buere. Ita{que} postremo leges / ma∣gestas yr̄a diuina et hu∣mana oia hostibus tradi∣ta sunt. Neque qui ea fecere pu∣e aut paenitet: sed ince∣dunt perora vestra ma∣gnifice: sacerdotia et cō∣sulatus: pas triumphos sus ostentantes perinde quasi ea honori non pre∣de habeant. Setuaere comparati / in∣iusta imperia dn̄orum nō {per}ferunt. Vos quirites in imperio rati / equo ani∣mo sruitutem toleratis.

Sed haec inter bonos amicitia: inter malos fa∣ctio est. {QUOD} si tantam vos curam libertatis haberetis: {quam} il∣li ad dominationē accen si sunt: profecto: ne{que} res publica (sicuti nunc) va∣staretur: et beneficia ve∣stra penes optimos nō au dacissimos forent.

Sin ea cōtemnit: scilicet existimabitis qualis illa pax aut deditio sit: ex qua ad Iugurtham scele∣rum impunitas: ad pau∣cos potentes maxime di∣uitie: ad rempu. damna atque dedecora peruene rint. Nisi fore non dū eti am vos dn̄ationis eorum satietas tenet: et illa {quam} haec tempora magis pla∣cent: cum regna / prouin∣cie / leges / ura / iudicia / bella / atque paces: postre mo diuina & humana om¦nia penes paucos erant. Vos autem inuicti ab ho∣stibus imperatores omni¦um gentium satis habe∣batis animam retinere. Nam seruitutem quidem quis vestrum recusare au¦debat?. At ego tametsi virum fla∣gitiosum existimo īpune iniuriā accepisse: tn̄ vos hoībus sceleratissimis i∣gnoscere: qm̄ cues sunt aequo aīo paterer ni mīa ī perniciem casura esset. Nam et illis quantū im∣portunitatis habent pa∣rum est impune male fe∣csse: nisi faciundi licen∣tia deinde eriptatur.
Et vobis eterna folicitu∣do remanebit: quum in∣telligitis aut serutendū esse aut per manus liber∣tatem retinendam. Nam fidei quid aut con cordie quae spes est? Dn̄ari ii volunt: vos li∣beri esse: facere illi iniu∣riam vos prohibere: po∣stremo socijs nostris velu ti hostibus: hostibus pro socijs vtuntur: potest ne in tam diuersis mentibus pax aut amicitia esse?

HEc atque alia huius cemodi saepe dicen∣do Memmius popu¦lo {per}suadet vt Lucius Cas¦sius qui tum pretor erat ad Iugurtham mitteret: eum{que} interposita fide pu¦blica Romā duceret: quo facili{us} idicio regis Scau∣i et reliquorum quos pe¦cunie capte arcessebāt de¦licta patfierent. DVm haec Rome gerū¦tur: qui in Numidia relicti a Bestia exer¦citui pre erant: sequuti morem imperatoris sui plurima & flagitiosissima fcere facinora. fuere qui auro corrupti elephan∣tos Iugurthae traderent. Alij perfugas venderent: pars expacatis predas a∣gebant. Tanta vis auari∣cie animos eorum veluti abes inuaserat.
AT Cassius / perlata rogatione a Caro Memmio / ac percul sa omni nobilitate / ad Iu¦gurtham proficiscitur: ei que timido et ex consci∣entia diffidenti rebus su∣is persuadet (quoniam se populo romano dedisset) ne vim {quam} misericordiam experir mallet. Priuatim praeterea fidem suam interponit / quā ō minoris {quam} publicam du∣cebat. Talis ca tēpestate fama de assio erat. Iugurtha cōtra decus re¦gium / cultu {quam} maxime mi¦serabili / cum Canto Ro∣mam venit. Ac tametsi in ipso magra vis animi e∣rat confirmato ab omni∣bus / quorum potentia aut scelere cūcta ea gesserat: quae supra dximus Caū tamen Bebium tribunum plebis / magna mercede parat cuius impudentia contra ius et iniurias om¦nes munitus foret.
A Caius Memmius ad∣uocata concione ({quam}{quam} re∣gi infesta plebs erat: et pars in vincula duci iu∣beret: pars vero nisocios sceleris aperiret: more maiorum de hoste suppli∣cium sumi dignitati ma∣gis {quam} ire consulens: seda∣re motus et animos eorū mollire / postremo confir∣mare fidem publicam per sese inuiolatam fore. Post vbi silentium cepit / producto Iugurtha / ver∣ba facit.

Sin reticeat: non saluti ocijs fore: sese et suas o∣pes corrupturum. Deinde vbi Mēmi{us} dicē∣di finem fecit / et Iugur∣tha ussus est respondere Caius Bebius (quē pecu∣nia corruptum supra di∣ximus) regem tacere iu∣bet: ac tametsi multitu∣do quae in cōcione aderat vehementer accensa ter∣rebat eū clamore vultu∣que: sepe impetu: at{que} a∣lijs omnibus quae ira fieri ama: Vicit tn̄ Bebij im∣pudentia.
Ita{que} populus ludibrio habitus ex con∣tione discessit. Iugurthae / Bestie{que} et cae∣teris quos illa questio ex agitabat aī augescunt. ERat ea tēpestate Ro∣mae Numida quidam nomine Massiua fili{us} Galussae: nepos Massinis∣sae: qui (quia in dissensione regum Iugurthae aduer∣sus fuerat) dedita Cirtha et Adherbale interfecto profugus ex Aphrica ab∣ierat. Huic Spurius Albinus qui proximo an∣no post bestiā cum quinto Minutio Ruffo cōsulatū gerebat: {per}suadet: quoni∣am e stirpe Massinissae sit Iugurtham ob scelera in uidia cū metu vrgeat: re∣gnum Numidiae a senatu petat. auidus consul bel∣li gerundi moueri {quam} sene scere omnia malebat. Ipsi prouincia Numidia Minutio Macedonia ob∣uenit. Que post{quam} Massi∣ua agitare cepit: ne{que} Iu∣gurthae in amicis satis p̄∣sidij est (quia corum aliū conscientia: alium mala fama et timor impedie∣bat)
Bomilchari proxīo ac maxime fido sibi impe¦rat vt precio (sicuti mul∣ta confecerat) i sidiato∣res Massiue paret: ac ma∣xime occulte: sinid parū procedat: quouis modo Numidam interficiat. Bomilchar mature regis mandata exequitur {per} ho¦mines talis negocij arti∣fices: itinera / egreus{que} / eius / postremo loca / at{que} tempora explorat. Dein∣de vbi res postulabat: in∣sidias tetendit. Igit vnus ex eo numero qui ad ce∣dem parati erant: paulo incō ultius Massiuā ag∣greditur: illūque obtrun¦cat. Sed ipse eprehēsus multis hortāribus, et in primis Albino consule in dicium profitetur. Fit re¦us magis ex aequo et bo∣no {quam} ex iure gentium Bo∣milchar comes eius qui Romā fide pu. venerat. At Iugurtha manifestus tanti sceleris non prius omisit contra verum ni∣ti / {quam} anima duertit supra gratiam ac pecuniam su∣am inuidiam sactesse. Igitur {quam}{quam} in priori actio ne ex amicis quinquagin ta vades dederat: regno magis {quam} vadibus consu∣lens: cam in Numidiam dimittit Bomilchar ēve∣ritus ne reliquos popula¦res metus inuaderet pa∣rendi sibi: si de illo sup∣plicium sumptum foret. Et ipse paucis diebus eo profectus est: iusius a se∣natu Italia discedere. Sed post{quam} Roma egressus

Huic rogationi partim conscij sibi: alij ex parti∣um inuidia pericula me∣tuentes: quoniam apar∣te resistere non poteran quī illa et alia ralia pla∣cere sibi faterentur occul¦te {per} amicos ac maxime {per} homines nominis latin et socios Italicos īpedi∣menta parabant. Sed plebs (īcredibile me∣moratu est) {quam}tum intenta fuerit {quam}taque vi rogatio nem iussrit: magis odio nobilitatis (cui illa mala parabantur) {quam} cura re∣publice. Tāta libido in partibus erat. Igitur caeteris {per}cul¦sis metu Marcus Scaur∣quem legatum Bestie su∣pra memorauimus inter leticiam plebis et suorū fugā trepida etiam tunc ciuitate quum ex Māli rogatiōe tres quesitores rogarētur: effecerat vti ipse in eo munero crea∣retur.
Sed questione exercita∣ta aspere violēterque ex rumore et libidine ple∣bis: vt saepe nobilitatem: sic ea tempestate plebem ex secundis rebus insolē∣tia ceperat. CEterum mos partiū popularium: et sea tus factionum: ac de inde omnium malarum artium paucis ante an∣nis Romae ortus est otio atque habundantia earū rerumque prima morta∣s ducunt. Nam ante Carthaginem deletam populus et sena¦tus roman{us} placide mo∣desteque inter se rempu∣blicam tractabant. Ne{que} glorie certamen ne{que} do∣minationis inter ciues e∣rat. Metus hostilis in bo∣nis artibus ciuitatem re∣tinebat. Sed vbi illa formido a mentibus discessit: scili∣cet
ea que res secunde a∣mant: lasciuia / atque su∣{per}bia incessere. Ita (quod in aduersis rebus optaue¦rant) ocium post{quam} adep∣ti sunt acerbius / asperi∣us que tulere. Nam cepere nobilitas di¦gnitatē in dn̄ationē: po∣pulus libertatē in libidi∣nem vertere: sibi quis{que} ducere / trahere / rpere. Ita omīa in duas partes abstracta sunt. respubli∣ca / quae media fuerat di∣lacerata est. Caeterū nobilitas factio∣ne mag{is} pollebat plebis. Vis soluta ac dispersa in multitudine minus pote∣rat. Paucorum arbitrio belli domique respublica agi∣tabatur: penes eosdē ae∣rarium / prouincie / magi¦stratus / glorie / triumphi que erant. Populus militia atque ī∣opia vrgebatur. Predas bellicas im{per}ato∣res cū paucis diripiebāt. Interea parētes aut par∣ui liberi militū (vti quis que potentiori confinis erat) sedibus pellebātur. Ita cum potentia auari∣tia sine modo modestra{que} inuadere / polluere / et va∣stare omnia: nihil pēsi ne que sancti habere quo ad semetipsā precipitauit.
Nā post{quam} Tiberius et Ca∣us Gracchus (quorū ma∣tores in punico bello at{que} alijs multum respublcae addiderāt) vendicare ple¦bem in libertatē: et pau∣corum scelera pateface∣re cepere nobilitas noxi a atque eo {per}culsa modo {per} socios ac nomē latinū / interdum per equites ro∣manos (quos spes socie∣tatis a plebe dimouerat) Gracchorum actionibus obuiā erat: et primo Ti∣beriū▪ deinde paucos post annos ingredientem ea∣dem Caum tribunum al terum triumurū in edu∣cendis colonijs cū Mar∣cho Fuluto Flacco ferro necauerat. Et sane Grac∣chis cupidine victorie nō satis moderatus fuit. Sed bono vinci facius est {quam} malo more iniuriā vin∣cere. Igiturea victoria nobili∣tas ex libidine sua vsa multos mortalis ferro aut fuga extinxit: plus{que} in reliquum sibi timoris {quam} potentie addidit. Quae res plerumque ma∣gnas ciuitates pessunde∣dit dū alteri alteros vin∣cere quouis modo / et vi∣ctos acerbius vlcisci vo∣lunt. Sed de studijs par∣tium oībus que ciuitatis morib{us} si singulatim aut pro magnitudine parem disserere: tp̄s {quam} res matu∣rius me desereret. Quam obrem ad inceptum re∣deo.
POst Auli fedus / exer∣citus que nostri fugā fedam / Quintus Me∣tellus et Marcus Silla∣nus consules designati / prouintias inter se parti uerant. Metello{que} Numidia ob∣uenerat / acri viro: et {quam}{quam} aduerso populi partibus / fama tamen aequabili et inuiolata. Is vbi primum magistra∣tū ingressus est: alia om∣nia sibi cum collega coīa ratus / ad bellum (quod ge∣sturus erat) aīm intēdit. Igitur diffidēs veteri ex ercitui: milites eligere / scribere / presidia vndi{que} accersere / ama / tela / e∣quos / et caetera instrumē∣ta militie parare: ad hoc cōmeatum affatim: deni∣que omnia quae in bello vario et multarum rerū egenti / vsui esse solent. Caeterum ad ea patran∣da senatus authoritate / socij / nomēque latinū / et reges. Postremo oīs ciui∣tas summo studio adnite∣bantur.
Itaque ex sententia om∣s rebus paratis com∣positisque in Numidiam proficiscitur magna spe¦ciuiū: tum propter artis bnas: tū maxime {quod} ad∣uersum diuitias inuictū animum gerebat: et aua∣ritia magistratuum ante id tēpus in Numidia no∣stre opes contuse: hostiū∣que aucte erant. Sed vbi in Aphricam venit exer∣citus ei traditur a Spu∣rio Albino procōsule in∣ers imbecillis ne{que} peri∣culi neque laboris pati∣ens: lingua {quam} manu prom¦ptior: predator ex socijs et ipse preda hostium si∣ne imperio & modestia ha¦bitus. Ita imperatori no∣uo plus e malis maiori∣bus solicitudinis {quam} ex co¦pia militū auxilij aut bo¦nae spei accedebat. Statu¦it tamen Metellus ({quam}{quam} et estiuorum tp̄s comitiorū mora imminuerat: et ex∣pectatione euentus ciui∣um aīos intentos puta∣bati non prius bellum at∣tingere: {quam} maiorū disci∣plina milites laborare coegisset. Nam Albinus Auli fratris exercitus{que} clade perculsus, post{quam} de∣creuerat non egredi pro∣uintia, {quam}tum tēporis aesti¦uorū in imperio fuit: ple∣rumque milites in statu∣tis castris habebat: nisi cum odor aut pabuli e∣gess locum mutare sub egerat. Sed neque more miltari vigilie duceban¦tur: vti cui{que} libebat, ab signis aberat. Lixae {per}mix¦ti cum equitibus die no∣ctuque vagabantur: & pa∣lantes gros vastare: vil∣las expugnare: pecoris et
mancipiorum predas / cer¦tantes agere: eaque mu∣tare cū marcatorib{us} / pro¦vino aduecticio / et alijs talibus. Praeterea frumentum pu¦blice datum vendere: pa∣nem indies mercari. Po∣stremo quaecun{que} dici aut fingi queunt ignauie lu∣xurie{que} probra in illo ex∣ercitu cuncta fuere: et a∣lia amplius. Sed in ea difficultate Metellū non minus {quam} in rebus hostili∣bus magnum et sapientē virum fuisse cōperio: tan¦ta temperātia inter am∣bitionem seuitiam{que} mo∣deratū. Nā{que} edicto pri∣mo adiumenta ignauiae dicit sustulisse ne quis{quam} ī castris panem / aut quem▪ aliumcibum coctum ven∣deret: ne lixe sequerētur exercitum: ne miles gre∣garius in castris neue in agmine seruū aut iumen tum haberet. Caeteris arte modum sta∣tuisse. Praeterea transuer¦sis itinerib{us} / quotidie ca∣stra mouere: vallo ac fos∣sa munire: vigilias cre∣bras ponere: et eas ipse cum legatis circūire. Item ī agmine inprimis modo: modo ī postremis: saepe in medio adesse: ne quispiam ordine grede∣retur: vt cum signis fre∣quētes incederent: miles cibum et arma portaret.
Ita prohibēdo a delictis magis {quam} vindicando exer¦citum breui cōfirmauit. INterea Iugurtha vbi ea quae Metellus age∣bat ex nūcijs accepit si mulde innocētia ei{us} cer∣tior Rome fact{us} diffidere suis rebus: ac tum deinum veram deditionem face∣rere conatus est. Igitur legatos ad consu∣lem cum supplicijs mit∣tit. Qui tantūmodo ipsi liberis que vitā peterēt: alia omnia dederent po∣pulo Romano. Sed Me∣tello tā antea experimē∣tis cognitum erat genus numidarum infidum in∣gnio mobili: nouaru re∣rum auidum esse. Itaque legatos alium ab alio di∣uersos aggreditur: ac pau satim tentando post{quam} o∣portunos sibi cognouit: multa pollicendo persua det vt Iugurtham maxīe viuum: sin id parum pro∣cedat: necatum sibi trade¦ent. Caetera palam  quae ex vo¦luntate forent nunciari regi iubet.
Deinde paucis diebus / in tento atque infesto exer∣citu / in Numidiam proce¦dit. Vbi contra belli faci∣em tuguria plena homi∣num: pecora / cultores{que} in agris erant: ex oppidis et mapalibus profecti re∣gis obuiam procedebant: parati frumentum dare: cōmeatum portare. Postremo omnia quae im∣perarentur facere. Neque Metellus idcirco¦min{us} sed pariter ac si ho∣stes adessent: munito ag∣mine īcedere: late explo∣rare: oīa illa deditionis si¦ga ostētui esse credere: & insidijs locum tentare. Ita{que} cū expeditis cohor¦tibus: Item funditorū et sagittariorū delecta ma∣nu apud primos erat. Postremo Caius Marius legatus cum equitib{us} cu∣rabat. In vtrum que lat{us} auxiliarios equites tribu¦nis legionū / et prefectis cohortum dispertiuerat: vt cū his velites {per}mixti quocūque accederent: e∣quitat{us} hostiū {pro}pulsarēt. Nam in Iugurtha tātus dolus / tantaque peritia locorum et militie erat: vt absens an presens pa∣cem an bellum gerens {per}∣nitrosior esset: in incerto haberetur. Erat haud lō∣ge ab eo itinere / quo Me∣tellus {per}gebat / opidū Nu∣midarum
noīe Vacca fo∣rum rerum venaliū toti{us} regnitet maxime celebra¦tū: vbi et incolere: et mer¦cari res consueuerāt Ita∣lici generis multi morta∣les. Huic consul simul tē¦tandi gra et capiundi (si paterent oportunitates loci) presidium imposuit. Praeterea im{per}auit frumē tū et alia quae bello vsui forent / cōportare: ratus (id quod res monebat) fre¦quētiam negociatorū et cōmeatū etiā paratis re∣bus munimento fore. In∣ter haec negotia Iugurtha impensius modo legatos supplices mittere: pacem rogare: preter suam libe∣rorumque vitam Metel∣lo omnia dedere. Quos itē (vt priores) cō∣sul illectos dimittebat ad proditionem: regi pa∣cem (quam postulabat) ne∣que abnuere: neque polli¦cer: et inter eas moras promissa legatorū ex pe∣ctare. Iugurtha vbi Metelli di∣cta cum factis composu∣it: ac se suis artibus ten∣tari aīaduertit (Quippe cui pa verbis nunciaba¦tur: caeterum rebellum a spertimū erat: Vrbs ma∣xima alienata: Ager hostibus cognitus animi popularium tenta¦ti) coactus rerum necessi∣tudine statuit armis cae∣are.
IGitur explorato itine∣re hostrum / in spem vi∣ctoriae adductus ex op∣portunitate loci: {quam} maxi∣mas copias potest oim ge¦nerū parat: ac per trami∣tes occultos exercitum Metelli anteuenit. Erat in ea Numidie par∣te: quā Adherbal in diui∣sione possederat: flumen oriens a meridie / nomine Muthul / a quo mons ab∣erat ferme milia pauū viginti tractu par: vastus a natura / et humano cul∣tu alienat{us}: sed ex eo me∣dio quasi collis oriebat / in immensum pertingen / vestitus oleastro / ac myr∣thetis / alijs{que} arborū ge∣neribus / que humo arida at{que} aenosa gignuntur. Media autem planicies deserta erat penuria a∣que / p̄ter flumini propin∣qua loca: ea consita arbu∣stis / pecore atque cultori∣bus frequentabantur. Igitur in eo colle (qem transuerso itinere porte∣ctum docuim{us}:) Iugurtha extenuata acie suorū cō∣sedit: elephantis et par∣ti copiarū pedestriū Bo∣milcharem prefecit: eum edocet / quae ageret: ipse propior montem cum om¦ni equitatu atque pediti¦bus delectis suos collo∣cat. Deinde singulas turmas et manipulos circūen monet atque obtestatur vti memores pristine vir¦tuis
e victorie: sese / re∣ umque ab Romano rū aicia defendant. Cum us certamen fore quos antea victos sub ugum miserint. Ducē illis non animum mutatum. Quae ab im{per}atore decue¦rint omnia▪ suis proui∣sa locum superiorem: vti prudētes cum imperitis / nec pauciores cum pluri∣bus / aut rudes cum bello melioribus / manum con∣sererent: proinde parti intenti{que} essent  siguo da∣to Romanos inuadere. Illumdē / aut omnis la∣bores et victorias confir¦maturū: aut maximarum erumnarum initiū fore. Adhoc viritim: vti quē{que} ob militare facinus pe∣cunia: aut honore extu∣lerat cōmone facere be∣neficij: et eum ipsum ali∣js ostentare. Postremo pro cuiusque ī genio pollicendo: mini∣tando: ostentando: alium alio modo excitare. Cum interim Metellus i∣gnarus hostium / monte degrediens cum exercitu conspicitur: primo dubi∣us / quidnam insolita fa∣cies ostenderet (Nam in∣ter virgulta equi Numi∣deque confederant / ne{que} plane occultati humili∣tate arborum: et tamen incertum / quidnam esset / tum natura loci: tum do∣lo: ipsi atque militaria signa obscurati) Deinde bui cognitis insidijs paulisper agmē cōstituit Ibi cōmutatis ordinibus ī dextro latere quod pro mum hostib{us} erat: tri∣plicibus
subsidijs acim instruxit: inter manipu∣los funditores et sagitta rios dispertit. equitatū omnem in cor∣nibus locat: ac pauca pro tēpore mi∣lites hortatus: aciem si∣cuti instruxerat: trāsuer¦sis principijs in planum . Sed vbi Numidas quic∣tos / neque digressos col∣le animaduertit: ex anni tēpore veritus / et inopia aquae / ne siti conficeretur exercitus: Rutiliū lega∣tum cū expeditis cohor∣tibus / et parte equitū pre misit ad flumen: vti locū castris ante caperet: exi∣stimans crebro hostes im∣petu / et transuersis preli∣js iterū / remoraturos: et (quoniam armis diffide∣rēt) lassitudinem et sitim militum tētaturos. Deinde ipse pro re atque loco / sicuti monte descen∣derat /  paulatim proce¦dere / Marium post princi∣pia habere: ipse cum equi tibijs sinistrae alae esse / qui in agmine princeps facti erant.
AT Iugurtha vbi ex tremū agmen Me∣telli primos suos praetergressum videt: prae sidio quasi duū miliū pe∣ditum montem occupat: quo Metellus descende∣rat: ne forte cedentibus aduersarijs receptui: ac post munimento foret. Deinde repente / signo da¦to hostes inuadit. Numi∣dae alij postremos caede∣re pars a sinistra ac dex∣tra tentare: infēsi adesse: instare atque omnibus locis romanorum ordi∣nes conturbare. Quo∣rum etiam qui firmiori∣bus animis obuij hostib{us} fuerant▪ ludificati incer∣to praelio: ipsi modo emi∣nus sauciabātur: ne{que} con¦tra feriendi aut coneren¦di manum copia erat. Ante iam docti ab Iugur¦tha equites: vbi romano rū turmae insequi coepe∣rant / non confertim ne{que} in vnum se recipiebant: sed alius alio {quam} maxime diuersi. Ita numero pri∣ores si a persequendo ho∣stes deterrere nequiue∣rāt: disiectos a tergo aut a lateribus circunuenie∣bant. Sin oportunior fu∣gae collis / quam cāpi fue∣rat: Ea vero loca consue∣ti numidarum equi faci∣le īter virguita euadere: Nostros asperitas et in∣solentia loci retinebat. Caeterum facies toti{us} ne∣goci varia: incerta: fe∣da atque miserabilis:
diuersi a suis pars rede- re: alij insequi: ne{que} signa ne{que} ordines obseruare: Vbi quem{que} periculū ce∣perat: ibi resistere ac pro∣pulsare. Arma / tela / equi / viri / ho∣stes / atque ciues {per}mixti: nihil cōsilio aut imperio ag: sors omnia regere· Itaque multum diei pro∣cesserat: cū etiam tū euen tus in incerto erat. Denique omnib{us} labore et estu languidis / Metel∣lus vbi videt Numidas minus instare: paulatim milites in vnum cōducit: ordines restituit: et co∣hortes legionarias qua∣tuor aduersus pedites ho¦stium collocat. Eorum magna pars locis superioribus sessa conse∣derat simul orare: horta¦ri milites ne deficerent▪ Neu paterētur hoste fu∣gientes vincere: neque illis castra esse: ne que munimentum vllum / quo cedentes tenderent: in armis omnia sita.
Sed nec Iugurtha quidē interea quietus erat: cir¦cūire / hortari / renouare / prelium: et ipse cum de∣lectis oīa subuenire suis: hostibus instare dubijs: quos firmos cognouerat: eminus pugnando reti∣nere. Eo modo inter se duo im¦peratores sūmi viri cer∣tabant: ipsi pares: caete∣rum opibus disparibus. Nam Metello virtus mi∣litū erat et locus aduer∣sus. Iugurthae alia oīa p̄∣ter milites opportuna. Deinde romani vbi intel¦ligunt neque sibi profu∣gium esse: neque ab hoste copiam pugnandi fieri: etiam diei vesper erat: aduerso colle (sicuti prae∣ceptum fuerat) euadunt. Amisso loco / Numidae fu∣si fugatique pauci inte∣riere. Plerosque veloci∣tas / et regio hostibus ig∣nara tutata sunt.
INterea bomilchar / quē eliphantis et parti co∣parū pedestrium prefe∣ctum a Iugurtha / supra di¦ximus: vbi eum Rutilius pretergressus est: paula∣tim suos in equum locum deducit: ac dum legatus ad flumen / quo premissus erat / festinās pergit qui∣et{us} (vti res postuabat) a∣ciem instruxit: neque re∣mittit explorare quid v∣bique hostis ageret. Postquam Rutilium con∣sedisie am et aīo vacuū esse accepit: simulque Iu∣gurthae ex prelio clamo∣rem augeri: veritus ne le∣gatus cognita re laborā¦tibus suis auxilio foret: aciem, quam diffidens vir¦tuti militum arcte statu∣erat, quo hostium itineri officeret, latius porrigit. Eoque modo ad Rutilij castra procedit. Romani ex īprouiso pulueris vim magnam aīaduertunt. Nam prospectū ager ar∣bustis cōsit{us} prohibebat. Et primo humū rati sunt aridam vento agitari. Post vbi aequabilem ma∣nere: scuti acies moueba¦tur: magis magis que ap∣propinquare videbant co¦gnita re / properantes ar∣ma capiūt: ac pro castris (sicuti imperatur) consi∣stunt. Deinde vbi propius ven∣tum est / vtrimque magno clamore concurritur.
Numidae tantūmodo sūt remorati / dū in eliphan∣tis auxilium putāt: post∣{quam} eos impeditos ramis arborum atque ita dise∣ctos circūueniri vident: fugam faciunt: ac pleri∣que abiectis armis collis aut noctis (quae iam ade∣rat) auxilio ītegri abeunt. elephanti quatuor capti: reliqui oēs numero qua∣draginta interfecti sunt. At romani {quam} {quam} itinere at¦que opere castrorū et prae∣lio fesi lassique erant: tn̄{que} Metellus amplius opi∣nione morabatur instru∣cti / intentique obuiam procedunt. Nam dolus Numidarum nihil languidi neque re∣missi patiebatur. Ac primo obscura nocte / post{quam} haud procul inter se erant strepitu velut ho¦stes aduentare: alteri a∣pud alteros formidinem imul et tumulum face∣re: et pene imprudentia admissum facinus mise∣rabile foret: ni vtrimque proemissi equites rem ex∣plorauissent. Igitur pro metu repente gaudium exhortum est. Milites alius alium laeti appeliant: acta edocent: atque audiunt: sua quis∣que fortia facta ad celum efert. Quippe humane res ita se habent: in victoria eti∣am ignauis gloriari li∣cet: aduerse res etiam de∣tractant bonos.
Metellus inijsdē castris quatriduo moratus: sau∣cios cum cura reficit: me ritos in prelijs more mi∣litiae donat: vniuersos in contione laudat: atque a¦git gratias: hortatur / ad caetera quae leuia sunt / parem animū gerant: Pro victoria satis iā pu∣gnatum: reliquos labo∣res praedae fore. Tum interim trāsfugant et alios oportunos vbi Iugurtha gentium: aut quid ageret: cum pauci ne esser: an exercitum ha¦beret: vt sese victus gere∣ret: exploratum misit.
At ille sese in loca saltu∣osa et munita natura re∣ceperat: ibique cogebat exercitum numero homi¦num ampliorem: sed he∣beem īfirmumque: agri ac pecoris magis {quam} belli cultorem. Id ea gratia eueniebat: {quod} praeter regios equites nmo omniū Numidarū ex fuga regem sequebat. Quo cuus{que} animus fert eo descedunt: neque id flatium militiae ducit: ita se mores habent. IGitur Metellus vbi vi¦det regis etiā tum ani∣mum ferocem esse bel∣lum renouari: quod nisi ex illius libidine gei nō posset: Praeterea iniquum certa men sibi cū hostibus: mi∣nore detrimento illos vī¦ci {quam} vincere: statuit non praelijs neque in ace / sed alio modo belum esse ge∣rendum.
Itaque in loca Numidiae opulentissima pergit: a∣gros vastat: castella mul∣ta et oppida temere mu∣nita aut sine presidio ca∣pit: incenditque. Puberes interficit: iube oīa alia  esse. Ea formidine multi mor∣tales romanis dediti: ob∣sides / frumētū / et alia que vsu rorēt: affatim prebi∣ta sunt: vbicū{que} res postu∣labat / presidiū impositū. Que negotia multo ma∣gis {quam} praeliū male pugna∣tum ab suis / regem erre∣bant. Quippe cui spes oīs ī fu∣ga sita erat: sequ coge∣batur: et qui sua loca de∣fendere nequiuerat: in a lienis ellum gerere: ta∣men ex inopa / quod opti¦mum videbatur consiliū / capit: exercitum plerumque in ijsdem locis o{per}iri iubet. Ipse cum delectis equiti∣bus Metellum sequitur nocunis auijsque iti∣neribus ignoratus roma nos palantes repente ag∣greditur. Plerique iner∣mes cadunt: multi capiū¦tur. Nemo omniū ita¦ctus profugit. Numidae prius{quam} subueniretur (si∣cuti ii erant) in proxi∣mos colles discedunt.
INterim Rome gaudiū ingen ortum est cogni¦tis Metelli rebus vt se / exercitumque more ma∣iorum gereret. {quam} {quam} inaduerso loco tn̄ vi∣ctor fuisse virtute hostiū agro potiretur. Iugurtham magnificum ex Auli secordia {quod} spem salutis insolitudine aut fuga coegessit habere. Itaque senatus ob ea fe∣liciter acta / dijs immorta libus supplicia decerne∣re. Ciuitas ārea trepida et solicita de belli euen∣tu laeta agere. Fama de Metello precla∣ra esse. Igitur eo intenti∣or Metellus ad victoriam niti omnibus modis: fe∣stinare: cauere: tn̄ necubi hosti oportunus fieret. Meminisse post gloriam inuidiam sequi: ita quo clarior eo magis anxius erat: neque post insidias Iugurthae effuso exerci∣tu praedari.
Sed vbi frumento aut pa¦bulo opus erat: cohortes cum omni equitatu prae∣sidium agebant. Exercitus partē ipse: re∣liquos Marius ducebat: sed igne magis {quam} praeda a¦ger vastabatur. Duobus locis haud lon∣ge iter se castra faciebāt. Vbi vi opus erat: cuncti aderant: caeterū quo u∣ga atque formido latius creeret: diuisi agebant. Eo tēpore Iugurtha per colles sequi: tp̄s aut lo∣cum pugnae quaerere: qua venturum hostem audie∣rat / pabulum aut aquarū fontes (quorum penuria erat) corrumpere. modo se Metello: īterdū Mario ostendere: postre∣mo in agmine tētare: a statim in colles regredi. Rursus alijs post alijs mi¦nitari: neque prelium fa∣cere: neque ocium patitantummodo hostem ab incepto retinere. ROmanus sperator / vbi se dolis fatiga∣ri vide: neque ab hoste copiam pugandi fieri: vrbem magnam et ī ea parte qua sita erat  ar∣tem
regni nomine Zamā statuit oppugnare: ratus (id quod negotium postu labat) Iugurtham labo∣rantib{us} suis auxilio ven∣rurū: ibi que preliū fore. At ille / que parabantur doctus a perfugis mag∣nis itineribus Metellum nteuenit: oppidanos hortatus / moe nia defendāt: addis au¦xilio perfugis / quod ge∣nus ex copijs regis (quia fallere nequibat) fortis∣simum erat. Praeterea pollicetur in tē¦pore semet cum exercitu affore. Ita cōpositis rebus / in lo∣ca {quam} maxime occulta de∣scendit: ac post paulo co∣gnoscit ex itinere Mari∣um frumēatum cū pau∣cis cohortibus Siccā mis¦sū / quod oppidum primū omnium post malam pu∣gnam ab rege defecerat. o cum delectis quitib{us} pergit noctu: et egredien tibus Romanis / in porta pugnam facit. Simul ma∣gna voce Siccenses hor∣tatur vti cohortes a ter∣go circumueniant: fortu∣nam illis praeclari faci∣noris casū dare: si id fece∣rint: postea sese in regno: illos in libertate sine me∣tu aetatē acturos. At ni Marius signa infer∣re atque euadere oppido propetauisset: profecto cuncti (aut magna pars) Siccensium fidem muta∣nissent. Tanta mobilita te sese Numidae geunt.
Sed milites Iugurthini / paulisper a rege sustenta¦ti / post{quam} maiore vi hostes vrgēt / paucis amissis / pro¦fugi discedunt. Marius ad Zammam {per}∣uenit. Id oppidum in campo si∣tum / magis opere {quam} natu¦ra munitum erat▪ nullius rei idoneae egens: armis viris que opulentum. Igitur Metellus / pro tem¦pore atque loco paratis rebus  cuncta menia exer∣citu circūuenit. Legatis imperat vbi quisque cu∣raret. Denique signo dato / vn∣di{que} simul clamor ingens oritur: neque ea res Nu∣midas terret: infensi / in∣tenti{que} sine tumultu ma∣nent: praelium incipitur. Romani pro īgenio quis que: pars eminus glande aut lapidibus pugnare: alij inuadere: ac muruni suffodere modo scalis ag¦gredi: cupere praeliū ma∣nibus facere. Cōtra ea oppidani in pro ximos saxa voluere: su∣des / pila / praeterea pice et sulphure tedam mixtam ardenti mittere.
Sed nec illos qui procul manserant timor animi satis munierat. Nā ple∣rosque iacula tormentis aut manibus emissa vul∣nerabant. Parique peri∣culo: sed ama impari: bo∣ni atque ignaui erant. DVm apud zammam sic certatur: Iugur∣tha ex inprouiso ca¦stra hostium cum magna manu inuadit (remissis qui in praesidio erant) et (omnia magis{quam} prelium expectantibus) portam it rumpit. At nostri repentino mo∣tu perculsi: sibi quisque pro moribus consulunt: aij fugere: alij arma ca∣pre: magna pars vulne∣rati aut occisi sunt. Caeterum ex omni multi¦tudine non amplius qua draginta memores nomi¦nis romani: grege facto locum coepere paulo {quam} a∣lij editiorem ne que inde
maxima vi depelli quine runt: Sed tela eminus missa re¦mittere: pauci in plurib{us} frustrari. Sin Numidae propius ac¦cessissent: ibi vero virtu∣tem ostendere: et eos ma∣xima vicedere: fundere∣atque fugare. Interim Metellus cum a¦cerime rem gereret cla∣morem a tergo ecepit. Deinde conuerso equo / a¦nimaduertit fugam ad se¦versum fieri: quae res in∣dicabat populares esse. Igitur equitatum omnē ad castra propere misit▪ ac statim Caium Marium cum cohortibus sociorū eumque lachrimans per amicitiā▪ perque rem pu∣blicam obsecrat: ne quam contumeliā remanete in exercitu victore: neue ho¦stes inultos abire sinat. Ille breui mādata efficit. At Iugurtha munimen∣to castrorum impeditus cum alij super vallū prae∣cipitarentur: alij in an∣gustijs ipsi sibi properan∣tes officerent: multis a∣missis in loca munita se∣se recipit. Metellus / infecto nego∣cio / post{quam} nox aderat / ī ca∣stra cum exercitu reuer∣titur. Igitur postero die prius{quam} ad oppugnandum egrederetur: equitatum omnē in ea parte / qua re∣gis
aduētus erat: pro ca∣ss agitare ubet: por∣tas et proxima loca tri∣bunis dispertit: deinde ip¦se pergit ad oppidum at∣que vti superiore die mu¦rū aggreditur. Interim Iugurtha ex occulto re∣pente nostros inuadit: et qui in proximo locati e∣rant paulis{per} territi / {per}tur bantur / tamen reliqui ci∣to subueniunt. Neque diutius Numidae resiste∣re quiuissent: ni pedites cum equitibus permixti magnam cladem in con∣gressu facerent: quib{us} il∣li reti / non (vti ineque∣stri fieri praelio solet) se∣qui: deinde vero cedere: sed aduersis equis cōcur∣rere: implicare: ac {per}tur∣bare aciem. Ita cum expeditis pedi∣tibus suis hostes pene vi∣ctos dare. Odem tempore apud  Zammam magna  cerabatur. Vbi quis  legat{us} aut tribunus : ibi acerime  alius spē in alio  {quam} in se habere.
Pariter oppid ani agere oppugnare: aut parate omnibus locis: auidius al¦teri alteros sauciare / quā semet tegere. Clamor {per}mixtus horta∣tione: leticia gemitu: itē strepitus armorū ad cae∣lum ferri: tela vtrinque volare. Sed illi, qui menia defen∣sabāt: vbi hostes paulu∣lum modo pugnam remi∣serant: inteni praelium equestre prospectabant. Eos (vt quae{que} res lugur∣thae erant) letos modo: pauidos modo aiaduer∣teres: ac sicuti audiri a suis aut cerni possent: ad∣monere alij: hortari alij aut manu significare: aut niti corporib{us}: et huc et illuc quasi vitabundi: aut iaciētes tela agitare. Quod vbi Mario cogni∣tum erat (nā is in ea par∣te curabat) cōsulto leui∣us agere: ac diffidentiam rei simulare: pati numi∣das sine tumultu praeū regis visere. Ita illis studio suorū a∣strictis repente magna vi¦murum aggreditur: et iā scalis aggre milites /
peope summa ceperant: cum oppidani cōcurrūt: lapides / ignem / alia prae∣terea tela ingerunt. Nostri primo resistere de inde vbi vne ac altere sea¦lae īminutae sunt: qui su{per}∣stiterant  afflicti sunt. Caeteri quoquo modo po∣tuere: pauci integri: ma∣gna pars confecti vulne∣ribus abeūt Deīde vtrin∣que lium nox diremit. MEtellus vbi videt frustra inceptū: ne∣que oppidum capi: neque Iugurtham niti¦nisi ex insidijs / aut suo lo∣co pugnam facere: etiam estatem exatam esse ab Zamma discessit: et in hijs vrbbus quae ad se de iccerant: satis{que} munite lco aut menibus erant: praesidia imponit. Ceterum exercitum in {pro}∣uintia / quae proxima est Numidae hyemandi gra∣tia collocat. Neque id tempus ex ali∣orum more quieti au lu∣xurie concedit. Sed quoniam armis bel∣lum parum procedebat: insidias regi per amicos tēdere: et orum persidia pro armis vti parat.
Igitur Bomilcharem qu Romae cum Iugurtha fu∣erat et inde vadibus da∣tis clam Massiae ncis iu¦diciū fugerat: {quod} ei {per} ma∣ximā amicitiā proxīa co¦pia fallendi erat: multis policitatiōibus aggredit ac primo efficit vti ad se coloquēdi gratia occul∣te veniat: deinde fide da∣ta si Iugurtham viū aut necatum sibi tradidisse: fore vt illi senatus impu∣nitatem et sua oīa cōce∣deret: facile Numidae {per}∣suadet: tū ingenio rufido tū metuenti ne si pax cū romanis fieret: ipse {per} cō¦ditiones ad supplicium traderetur Is vbi primum opportu∣num fuit Iugurtham an¦xium ac miserantem for¦tunas suas accedit. Monet at{que} lachrimans obtestatur vti aliquando sibi / liberis{que} et gēti Nu∣midaum optime merite prouideat: oībus praelijs sese victos: agrū vastatū multos mortalis captos aut accisos: regni ope cōminutas esse: satis se∣pe iā virtutem militū et fortunam tentatam: ca∣ueat ne illo cunctāte Nu¦midae sibi consulant. His at{que} alijs talibus ad
deditionem regis animū impellit: mittuntur ad ī∣peratorem legati: qui Iu¦gurtham imperata factu¦rum dicerent: ac sine vl∣la pactione sese / regnum∣que suum in illius fidem tradere. Metellus cunctos sena∣torij ordinis exhibernis propere accersi ubet: eo¦rum atque aliorum quos idoneos ducebat: consili∣um habet. Ita more maiorum cōsi∣lij decreto {per} legatos Iu∣gurthae imperat argenti pondo ducentamilia / ele¦phantos omnes / equorū et armorum aliquātulū. Quae post{quam} sine mora fa∣cta sūt: iubet omnes per∣fuga vinctos adduci. Eorū magna pars vti ius¦sum erat adducti. Pauci quum primū dedi∣tio cepit: ad regem Boc∣chum ī mauritaniā abie∣rant. Igitur Iugurtha vbi armis / virisque et pe∣cunia spoliatus est: cum ipse ad imperandum Tisi diū vocaretur rursus ce∣pit flectere aīm: et ex ma∣la conscientia digna ti∣mere. Denique multis diebus {per} dubitationem consump∣tis: quum modo taedio re∣rum aduersarum oīa bel∣lo potiora duceret: inter¦dum secū ipse reputaret {quam} grauis casus inseruiti∣um ex regno foret mul∣tis magnisque praesidijs ne quic{quam} perditis de inte¦gro bellum sumit.
Et Romae senat{us} de pro∣uincijs cōsultus: Numi∣diā Metello decreuerat. PEr idem tempus Vti¦ce sorte Caro Ma∣rio per hostias dija supplicanti magna atque mirabilia portēdi harus∣pex dixerat. Proinde quae animo agi∣tabat fret{us} dijs ageret. {quam} sepissime fortunam ex {per}iretur: et omnia prospe∣re euentura. At illum iam antea con∣sulatus ingēs cupido ex∣agitabat: ad quem capiē dum preter vetustarē fa∣milie oīa abunde erant:
industria / probitas / mili∣tie magna scientia / ani∣mus belli ingens / domi modicus: libidinis: et di∣uitiatum victor: tantum modo glorie auidus. Sed is natu et per omnē pueritiam Arpin alitu vbi pimum etas militie patiens fuit stipēdijs fa∣ciundis: non greca facun∣dia: ne{que} vrbanis munditi s sese exercuit: ita inter artis bonas integrum in genium breui adoleuit. Ergo vbi primum tribu∣natum militarē a popu∣lo petit plerisque faciem eius ignorantibus facile notus per omni tribus declaratur. Deinde ab eo magistratu alium post alium sibi pe∣ptit: sem{per}que in potesta¦tibus eo modo agitabat: vt ampliore honore {quam} ge¦ebat dignus haberetur. Tamen is ad id locorum talis vi consulatum pe∣ere non aude bar. Nam postea ambitiōe p̄∣ceps datus est. Et iam tum alios magi∣stratus plebs: consulatū nobilitas {per} manus inter se tradebat▪ Nouus ne∣mo tam praeclarus: ne{que} tam egregijs factis erat: quin is indignus illo ho∣nore haberetur. Igitur vbi Marius har▪
spicis dicta eodē quo cu∣pido animi hortabat in∣tendere videt ab Metel∣lo consulatum petendi gratia missionem rogat. Cui {quam} {quam} virtus / gloria at∣que alia optanda boni su{per}abant: tamen inerat cōtemtor animus et su∣{per}bia ce nobilitatis ma∣lum. Itaque primum cōmotu insolita re / mirari eius consilium: et quasi pera micitiam mouere: ne tam praua inci{per}et: neu supra fortunam aīm gereret. non ominia omnibus cu∣piēda esse: debere ille res suas satis placere. Postrēo caueret id pete∣re a po. romāo quod illi iure negaretur. Post{quam} haec at{que} alia talia dixit: neque animus Ma¦rij flectitur: respōdit vbi primum potuise {per} ne∣gotia publica facturum sese quae peteret. Ac postea sepe eadem po∣stulanti fertur dixisse: ne festinaret abire: satis ma¦ture illum cum filio con∣sulatum petiturum. Is eodem tempore in cō∣tubernio patris ibidem militabat ānos nat{us} cir∣citer viginti. Quae res Marium tū pro honore quem affectabat:
um pro licentia redeun∣di quem ab eo impetrare nequibat: contra Metel∣lum vehementer accēde∣rat. Ita cupidine at{que} ita pessimis consultoribus gra ari: neque facto vl∣lo neque dicto abstinere: quod modo ambiciosum foret. Milites quibus in hiber∣nis praecrat laxiore impe¦rio {quam} ante habere. apud negociatores quo{rum} magna multitudo Vticae erat: criminose et simul magnifice de bello loqui dm dia pars exercitus si sibi {per}mitteretur: paucis diebus Iugurtham in ca∣thenis habiturum: ab im¦peratore cōsulto bellum trahi: {quod} homo inanis et regie su{per}bie imperio ni∣mis gauderet: Quae omnia illis eo fir∣miora videbantur: quia diuturnitate belli res fa∣miliares corruperat: et animo cupenti nihil sa∣tis festinatur. Erat preterea in exerci∣tu nostro numida quidam nomine Gauda Manasta balis fili{us}: Massinisse ne∣pos: quem Micipsa testa∣mento secundum heredē scripserat: morbis conse∣ctus et ob eā causam mē∣te paululū imminuta. Cui Metellus petēti mo∣re
regum vt sellam iuxta ponere: item postea cu∣stodie causa turmā equi∣tum romanorum: vtrum que negauerat: honorem {quod} eorū modo foret quos populus romanus reges appellauisset: presidium {quod} cōtumeliosū foret: si e∣quites romani satelliti numidae traderentur. Hunc Marius anxiū ag∣greditur: atque hortatur vt contumeliarum im{per}∣atoris cū suo auxilio pe∣nas petat: hominem ob morbos animo parū va∣lido secunda oratione ex tollit: illum regem ingen¦tem virum Massinissae ne potem esse: si Iugurtha captus aut occisus foret imperium Numidiae sine mora habiturum. id adeo mature posse eue¦nire: si ipse consul ad id bellum missus foret. Itaque et illum / et equi∣tes romanos: milites et negotiatores alios ipse▪ pleros{que} pacis spe impel∣lit vti romam ad suos ne∣cessarios aspere ī Metel∣lum de bello scribant▪ Marium imperatorē po∣scāt sic illi a multis mor∣talibus honestissima suf∣fragatione consulat{us} pe∣tebatur. Simul ea tempe¦state plebs nobilitate su∣sa per legē manliam no∣os extollebat.
Ira Mario cuncta proce∣dere. INterim Iugurtha post q̄ omissa deditione bel¦lum incipit: cū magna cura parate omnia festi∣nare: exercitum cogere: cuitates quae a se defce¦rt formidīe: aut ostētan¦do praemia affectare: cō∣munire suos locos: arma la: aliaque quae spe pa∣cm serat reficere aut cōmcari: seruitia rōa∣rorum allicere: et eosi∣psos qui ī praesidijs erāt pcnia tentare: prorsus itactum nihil ne{que} quie∣tum pati: cuncta agitare. Igitur Vaccēses (quo Me¦tllus in initio Iugurtha pacificante presidium ī∣posuerat)
fatigati regis supplicijs: ne{que} antea sua voluntate alienati prin∣cipes ciuitatis īter se cō∣iurant. Nam vulgus vti plerū{que} solet et maxime Numi∣darum ingenio mobili se¦ditiosum atque discordi¦osum erat cupidū noua∣rum rerum quieti et otio aduersum. Deinde cōpo∣sitis inter se rebus in diē tercium constituunt {quod} is festus celebratus que per omnem Aphricam: ludū et lasciuiam magis {quam} for∣midinem ostēdebat. Sed vbi tempus fuit centuri ones tribunos{que} milita∣res et ipsum praefectū op∣pidi. Titum Turpilium Sillanum alius alium in domos suas inuitant: eos oīs praeter Turpiliū inter epulas obtrūcant. Postea milites palantes: inermes quippe ī tali die ac sine imperio aggredi∣untur. Idē plebs facit pars edo∣cti a nobilitate: alij studi¦o talium rerum incitati. Quis act consilium{que} i∣gnoratibus tumultus ip∣se et res nouae atis pace
Romani milites ī∣prouio metu incerti ig∣ati{que} quid potissimū fa∣cerent trepidare. Ad arcem oppidi vbi signa et scuta erant praesidium hostium: portae ante clau∣sae ugam prohibebāt ad hoc mulieres pueri{que} pro¦tectis aedificiorum saxa et alia quae locus praebe∣bat certatī anceps malū ne{que} a sortissimis ī firmis∣simo generi resisti posse: iuxta boni mali{que} strenui et ībecilles multi obtrū∣cati sunt. In ea tanta asperitate saeuissimis nu∣midis et oppido vndique clauso. Turpilius praefe∣ctus vnus ex oībus Itali cis profugit intactus. Id misericordia ne hospitis an pactiōe an casu ita e∣uenerit parum cōperim{us} nisi quia quod illi in tan∣to malo turpis vita inte∣gra fama poior fuit im∣probus instabilique vi∣detur. MEtellus post{quam} de re¦bus Vaccae actis cō∣perit paulis{per} moe∣stuse conspectu abijt. Deinde vbi ira et aegritu do permista sunt cum ma¦xima cura vltū ire iniu∣rias festinat.
Legionem cum qua hye∣mabat et {quam} plurimos pōt numidas equites pariter cum occasu solis expedi∣tos educit. Et postera die circiter ho¦ram tertiam peruenit in quādam planiciem locis paulo superioribus cir∣cūuentam. Ibi milites fessos itineris magnitu∣dine etiam abnuētes oīa docet: oppidum Vaccam non amplius mille passu∣um abesse decere reliquū laborem aequo aīo pati: dum pro ciuibus fuis vi∣ris fortissimis at{que} miser¦rimis poenas caperent: praeterea praedā benigne ostētat sic animis eorum arrectis equites ī primo latere: pedites {quam} arctissi∣me ire et signa occultare iubet. Vaccenses vbi aīaduerte¦re ad se versum exercitū {per}gere: prīo (vti res erat) Metellum esse rati: por∣tas clausere. Deinde vbi ne{que} agros vastari: et eos qui primi aderāt Numi∣das equites vident: rur∣sum Iugurthā arbitrati cum magno gaudio: ob∣uij procedunt. Equites et pedites repē∣te signo dato alij vulgū effusum oppido caedere a¦lij ad portas festinare: pars turres capere.
Ira atque praede spes am∣plius {quam} laditudo posse. Ita Vaccenses biduū mo∣do ex perfidia laetati. Ciuitas magna et opulē∣ta cuncta poene at{que} prae∣dae fuit. Turpilius quem prefectū oppidi vnū ex oībus pro∣fugisse supra ostendimus iussus a Metello causam dcere: post{quam} se parum ex∣purgat: condēnatus ver∣beratus{que} poenas capite soluit. Nam is ciuis ex la∣tio erat. PEr idem tēpus Bomil¦char: cuius ipulsu Iu¦gurtha deditionem quam metu deseruit ince¦perat: suspectus regi et ipse eum suspicans: no∣as res cupere ad {per}niciē eius dolum quaerere: diu noctu{que} fatigare aīm: de∣ni{que} oīa tentanto socium sibi adiungit Nabdalsā
hominem nobilem ma∣gnis opibus clarum ac∣ceptū{que} popularib{us} suis. Is plerūque seorsum ab rege exercitum ductare: et oēs res exequi solitus erat: quae Iugurthae fesso aut maiorib{us} astricto su∣perant: ex quo illi gloria opesque inuente. Igitur vtrius{que} consili dies insidijs statuitur. Caetera vti res posceret pro tempore parari pla∣cuit. Nabdalsa ad exer∣citum proectus est quem inter hiberna romanorū iussus haberet ne ager in vltis hostibus vastaret. Is post{quam} magnitudine fa∣cinoris perculsus ad tps non venit metus{que} res im¦pediebat. Bomchar si∣mul cupidus incoepta pa∣trandi: et timore socij an¦xius: ne omisso vetere cō¦silio nouum quaereret li∣teras ad eum {per} homines fideles mittit ī quis mol¦liciē secordiam{que} viri ac∣cusare: e testari deos per quos iurasset monere ne praemia Metelli in pestō conuerteret: Iugurthae ex¦itum adesse: caeterum sua ne an Meteli virtute pe∣riret: id modo agitari.
Proinde reputaret ani∣mo suo praemia an cruci∣atum mallet: sed cum literae allatae fu∣ere: sorte Nabdalsa ex∣ercitato corpore fessus in lecto quiescebat. Vbi co∣gnitis Bomilcharis ver∣bis prīo cura: deinde vti aegrum animum solet: sō∣nus coepit. Erat ei numida quidam negotiorū curator fidus acceptus{que} et oīm consi∣liorū nisi nouissimi parti¦ceps. Qui post{quam} allatas literas audiuit et ex con∣suetudine ratus o{per}a aut ingenio suo opus esse: ta¦bernaculū introiuit. Dor¦miente illo eplam super caput in puluino temere positam sumit ac {per}legit Deinde propere cognitis insidijs ad regem pergit Nabdalsa post paulo ex∣prectus vbi neque eplam repperit et rem oēm vti a¦cta erat ex {per}sugis cogno∣uit: primo indicem perse∣qui conatus est post {quam} id frustra suit: Iugurtham placandi gratia accedit: dicit quae ipse facere pa∣rauisset {per}fidia cliētis sui praeuenta: lacrimans ob∣testatur {per} amicitiā per{que} sua ante fideliter acta ne super tali scelere suspe∣ctum se haberet. Adea rex aliter {quam} animo gerebat placide respōdit
Bomilchare interfecto / a∣lijsque multis / quos soci∣os insidiarum cognouit / iram oppresserat: ne qua seditio aut bellum ex eo negotio oriretur. Neque post id / Iugurthae dies aut nox vlla quieta fuit: ne{que} loco / neque mor¦tali cui{quam} / aut tempori sa∣tis credere. Ciues hostes que iuxta metuere circū∣spectare oīa / et omnistre∣pitu pauescere: ao at{que} alio loco saepe cōtra dec{us} regū noctu requiescere: interdum somno exitus arreptis armis / tumultū facere: ita formidīe qua si vecordia agitare. IGitur Metellus vbi de casu Bomilcharis / et in¦ditio patefacto ex per∣fugis cognouit rurfus tā∣{quam}ad integrū bellum cun∣cta parat festinat{que} Mari∣um fatigantem de profe∣ctione simul et inuisum et offensum sibi parū ido neū rat{us}: domū dimitti▪
Haec Romae plebs / literis quae de Metello et Mario missae erant / cognitis / vo∣lenti animo de ambobus acceperat▪ imperatori no¦bilitas, quae antea dècori fuit inuidie esse. At illi alteri gen̄is hūilitas fa∣uorem addiderat. Caeterum in vtro{que} ma∣gis studia partium {quam} mala aut bona sua moderata sunt. Praeterea seditio si magi∣stratus vulgum exagita∣te. Metellū omnibus con¦cionib{us} capti atcessere. Maij virtutem in ma celebae. Denique plebs se est ac∣censa vti opifices▪ aggre∣stesque omnes: quorum res fidesque in manibus site erant relctis operis frequentarent Mariū: et vt sua necessaria post il∣lius honorem ducerent. Ita perculsa nobilitate post multas tempestates nouo homini consulatus mandaret. Et postea populus a Tri∣buno plebis Lucio Man∣lio mancino rogatus / quē
vellet cum Iugurtha bel¦lum gerere: frequēs Ma∣um ussit. Sed senatus paulo ante Metello Nu∣midiam prouinciam de∣creuerat ea res frustra e∣rat. EOdem tēpore Iugur∣tha amissis amic{is} (quo¦rum pleros{que} ipse ne∣cauerat: caeteri ormidie: pars ad romanos: alij ad regem Bocchum profuge¦rant) quum neque bellum geri sine ministris pos∣set: et nouorum fidem in tanta perfidia veterum experiri periculosum du∣ceret: varius incertus{que} agitabatur: ne{que} illi res: neque consilium / aut quis quā hominum satis pla∣cebat: itinera / profectus que indies mutare: mo∣do aduersus hostes: inter∣dum solitudines perge∣re: sepe in fuga / ac paulo post in armis spem habe∣re: dubitare / virtuti an fi∣dei popularin̄ minus cre∣deret. Ita quocun{que} intē∣derat res aduerse erant. Sed inter eas moras re∣pente sese Metellus cum exercitu ostendit. Numi∣dae ab Iugurtha pro tem∣pore parati / instructique sunt. Deinde praelium in∣cipitur: qua in parte reae

Igitur oīa iumenta sarcinis leuari iubet: nisi frumento die∣rum decē. Caeterum vtres modo et alia vasa aquae idona portari. Praeterea cōquirit ex agris {quam} pluri∣mum potest domiti peco∣ris: eo{que} imponit vasa cu∣ius{que} modi: sed pleraque lignea collecta ex tugu∣rijs numidarum.

Praeterea cōmeatus spe amplior: quia numidae (si∣cuti pleri{que} faciunt) ī no¦ua deditione officia intē∣derant: Caeterum milites pro re∣ligione pluuia magis vsi. Ea{que} res multum animis eorum addidit. Nam rati sunt sese dijs immortalibus curae esse. Deinde postero die cōtra opinionem Iugurthae / ad Thalam pueunt.

Ne{que} po∣stea vllo in loco amplius vna die aut vna nocte mo¦ratus simulabat se nego∣tij gratia properare. Cae∣terum proditionem time¦bat / quam vitare posse ce∣leritate putabat. Nam talia consilia solent per otium ex opportunitat capi. At Metellus vbi oppida∣rios

Praeterea regis Bocchi∣proximus magnis mune∣ribus et maioribus pro∣missis ad studium sui pel∣licit: quis adiutorib{us} re∣gem aggressus impellit vti aduers{us} romanos bel∣lum incipíat.

Quam rem opportunissima incepto bello pauci īpediuerant. caeci auaritia quis oīa ho¦nesta at{que} inhonesta ven∣dere mos erat. Etiam antea Iugurthae fi¦lia Boccho nupserat. Ve∣rum ea necessitudo apud numidas mauros{que} leuis docitur: {quod} singuli pro o∣pibus quis{que} {quam} plurimas vxores: alij denas alij plures habeāt. Sed reges eo amplius ita aīm{us} mul¦titudine distrahitur: nul∣lam pro socia obtinet: pa¦riter oēs viles sunt. Igitur in locum ambobus placitum exercitus cōue¦niunt ibi fide data & ac∣cepta Iugurtha Bocchi a¦nimum oratione accen∣dit: romanos īiustos pro∣fūda auaritia: cōmunes oīm hostes esse eandē cau¦sam illos belli habere cū Boccho quā secum et cū alijs gētibus: libidinem imperandi.

AT Marius (vt supra diximus) cupientis¦sima plebe consul factus / post{quam} ei prouinciā Numidiā populus iussit: antea iā infestus nobilita¦ti: tū vero multus & ferox instare. modo singulos: modo vniuersos ledere. Dictitare sese consulatū ex victis quasi illis spoli a coepisse. alia p̄terea ma¦gnifica pro se / et illis do∣lentia. Interim que bello opus erant / prima habe∣re: postulare legionibus supplementum: auxilia a populis et regibus soci∣is{que} accersere. Praeterea ex latio fortis∣simū quem{que} / pleros{que} mi∣litia / paucos fama / cogni∣tos accire: et ambiendo cogere hoies emeritis sti¦pendijs proficisci: neque illi senatus / {quam}{quam} aduersus erat: de vllo negotio ab∣nuere audebat. Caeterum supplementum etiam laetus decreuerat: quia / ne{que} plebe militiam volente / putabatur Ma∣rius: aut belli vsum / aut studia vulgi amissurus. Sed ea res frustra spera∣ta▪ tanta libido cum Ma¦rio eundi pleros{que} inua∣serat:
sese quis{que} praeda locupletem ore: victorē domum rediturum: alia huiuscemodi ais attra∣hebant: et eos non paulu∣lum oratione sua Mari∣us arrexerat. Nam post{quam} oībus decretis / quae postu lauerat: milites scribere vult hortandi causa / si∣mul: et nobilitatem (vti consueuerat) exagitandi concionem populi aduo∣cauit. Deinde hoc modo disseruit. SCio ego Quirites ple∣ros{que} non ijsdem arti¦bus imperiū a vobis petere: et post{quam} adepti sūt gerere. Primo industrios / supplices / modicos esse: dehirc per ignauiam et supbiam etatem agere. Sed mihi contra videtur. Nam quo pluris vniuer∣sa respu. est {quam} consulatus aut praetura: maiore cu∣ra illam administrari {quam} haec peti debere. Neq: me fallit / {quam}tum cum maximo vestro beneficio negotij sustineam. Bellū parare simul et aerario {per}∣cere: cogere ad militiam eos quos nolis offendere:
domi foris{que} omnia cura¦re et ea agere inter inui∣dos / occursātes / factiosos: opinione quirites aspe∣rius est. Ad hoc alij si deliquere: vetus nobilitas: maiorū fortia facta: cognatorum et affinium opes: multae clientelae: omnia praesidio adsunt. Mihi spes omnes in me∣met sitae: quas necesse est et virtute et innocentia tutari: nam alia infirma sunt. Et illud intelligo Quirites omniū ora ī me conuersa esse: aequos bo∣nos{que} fauere: quippe mea benefacta reipu. proce∣dunt: nobilitatem inua∣dendi me quaerere locum. Quo mihi acri{us} adniten∣dū est: vti ne{que} vos capia∣mini: et illi frustrari sit. Ita ad hoc aetatis a pue∣ritia fui: vt omnes labo∣res et pericula consueta habeam: quae ante vestra beneficia gratuito facie∣bam ea vti / accepta mer∣cede / deseram / non est con¦silium / Quirites. Illis difficile est in pote∣statibus tem{per}are: qui per ambitionem ese probos
simulauēre. mihi qui om∣nem aetatē in optimis ar∣tibus aegi: benefacere iā ex consuetudine in natu∣ram conuertitur. Bel um gerere me cū Iu∣gurtha ussistis / quā rem nobilitas aegertime tulit. queso reputate cum ani∣mis vestris num id muta∣ri melius sit: si quem ex illo globo nobilitatis ad hoc negotium: aut ad a∣liud tale mittatis homi∣nem veteris prosapiae: ac multarum imaginum et nullius stipendij: scilicet vt in tāta re ignarus om∣niū trepidet: festinet: su∣ma aliquē ex pplo mo∣nitorē sui officij: ita ple¦rūque euenit vt quē vos im{per}are iussistis: is sibi im¦peratorē alium quaerat. At{que} ego scio quirites / q̲ post{quam} cōsules facti sunt: acta maiorum / et graeco{rum} militaria praecepta lege¦re coeperunt / hoēs praepo∣steri: nam gerere {quam} fieri tempore posterius re  at∣que vsu prius est. Comparate nunc Quiri∣ cum illorum superbi∣e hominem nouum.
Quae illi audire et lege∣re solent eorum partem vidi: alia agomet gessi: q̄ illi litteris / ego ea militā¦do didici: nunc vos existi¦mate facta an dicta plu∣ris sint. Contemnunt no∣uitatem meam ego illo{rum} ignauiam: mihi fortuna illis probra obiectantur: {quam}{quam} ego naturam vnam et cōmunem oīm existimo sed fortissimum quem{que} generosissimum esse. At si iam ex patribus Al∣bini aut Bestiae / queti pos∣set me ne / an illos ex se gi¦gni maluerint: quid re∣sponsuros creditis? nis sese liberos {quam} optimos voluisse? {QUOD} si iure despiciunt me faciant idem maioribus fuis quibus vti mihi / ex virtute nobilitas coepit. Inuident honori meo: er∣go inuideant labori / & in nocentiae periculis etiā meis quoniam {per} haec illū honorem coepi. Verū corrupti hoīes su{per}∣bia / ita aetatem agūt qua si vestros honores contem¦nant: ita hos petunt / qua∣si honeste vixerint. Nae illi fals sunt / qui di∣uersissimas res pariter expectant: ignauiae volu∣ptatem / et praemia virtu∣tis. Atque etiam cum a∣pud vos aut i senatu ver∣ba faciunt plerà{que} orati∣one
maioros suos extol∣lunt eorum fortia facta memorando / clariores es∣se putant: quod contra est Nam quanto via eorum praeclarior: tanto horum secordia flagi ciosior. Et profcto ita se res habet· Maiorū gloria quasi po∣steris lumen est: ne{que} bo∣na neque mala eorum in occulto patitur. Huiusce rei ego īopiam patior quirites. Verū id quod multo preclari{us} est meamet facta mihi dice∣re lcet. Nūc videte / {quam} in qui sunt: quod ex aliena virtute sibi arrogant id mihi ex mea non conce∣dūt: scilice / {quod} imagines non habeo: et quia mihi noua nobilitas est: quam certe peperisse melius est {quam} acceptam corrupisse. Equidem non ignoro: si iam respondere velint / a¦bunde illis facundam et compositam orationem fore. Sed in maximo ve∣stro beneficio cum oībus locis me vos{que} maledict{is} lacerent non placuit re∣ticere: ne quis modestiā in conscientiam duceret. Nam me equidem ex ani¦mi sententia nulla orati∣o laedere pōt: quippe ve∣ra
necesse est praedicent▪ falsa vita mores{que} meisu perant.. Sed quoniam ve¦stra consilia accusantur qui mihi sūmum honorē et maximum negotiū im∣posuistis: etiam at{que} etiā animis reputate num eo¦rum poenitēdum sit. Nō possum fidei causa ima∣gines: neque triumphos aut consulatus maiorum meorum ostendere. At si res postulet hastas / vexil∣lum: phaleras: ala mi∣litaria dona praeterea ci∣catrices in aduerso cor∣pore. Hae sunt meae imagines: haec nobilitas non here∣ditate relicta vt illa illi sed quae meis laboribus et periculis quaesiui. Nō sunt composita mea ver∣ba: parum id facio: ipsa se virtus satis ostendit. Illis artificio opus est vt turpia facta oratione te¦gant. Ne{que} graecas litte∣ras didici: parum place∣bat eas discere: q̲ppe quae ad virtutem doctoribus nihil profuerant. At illa multo optima rei¦pu. doctus sum: hostes fe∣rire: praesidia agitare: ni∣hil metuere / nisi turpem famam: hyemē et aestatem iuxta pati: humi requies∣cere eodem tēpore inopi am et laborem tolerare. Ergo his ego praeceptis milites hortabor: neque arcte colā illos vt me o∣pulentēt ne{que} gloriā meā laborem illorum faciam.
Hoc est vtile hoc ciuile ī∣perium. Nam cum tute per molliciem agas: sup∣plicio cogere: id est dn̄m non imperatorem esse. Haec at{que} alia talia no∣stri maiores faciendo se∣que rem{que} pu. celebraue∣re: quis nobilitas freta ipsa dissimilis moribus: nos illorum aemulos con∣tēnit et oīs honores non ex merito▪ sed quasi debi∣tos a vobis repetit. Caete ruin hoīes su{per}bissimi: pro¦cul errant. Maiores eorū oīaquae licebat / illis reli∣quere: diuicias imagines: memoriam sui praeclaram virtutem non reliquere ne{que} poterant: ea sola ne{que} datur dono / ne{que} accipit̄. Sordidum me et incultis moribus aiunt {quod} parum scite conuiuium exorno: neque histrionem vllum ne{que} pluris coquum {quam} vil¦licū habeo: quae mihi nō libet confiteri quirites: nam ex parente meo et a lijs sanctis viris ita acce¦pi: mūdicias mulicribus viris laborem conuenire omnibus bonis oportere plus gloriae {quam} diuitiarū: arma non supellectilem decori esse. Quin ergo quod iuuat: quod{que} carum aestimant id sem{per} faciant amēt: po¦tent vbi adulescētiam ha¦buere: ibi senectutē agant in conuujs: dediti vētri et turpissimae parti corpo¦ris:
sudorem: puluerē: e alia talia nobis relīquāt quibus illa epulis iucun∣diora sunt. Verum non ita est. Nam vbi se flagitijs dedecora uere turpissimi viri bo∣norum praemia ereptum unt: ita iniustissime lu∣xuria et ignauia / pessime artes / illis qui coluere e∣as / nihil officiunt reip. in noxiae cladi sunt. Nunc quoniā illis / quantū mei mores / non quantū illo{rum} flagicia poscebāt respon¦di: pauca de rep. loquar. Primum oīm de Numidi a bonum animum habe∣tote Quirites. Nam quae vs{que} hoc tempus lu∣gurthā tutata sunt: oīa remouistis / auaritiam / im¦peritiam / at{que} su{per}biam. Deinde exercitus ibi est loco{rum} sciens: sed me her∣le magis strēnuus / {quam} fe∣lix. Nā magna pars eius auaritia aut temeritate ducum attrita est. Quā∣obrē vos / quibus in est mi¦litaris aetas: adnitimini mecū: et capessite rēpu. Ne{que} quem{quam} ex calamita te aliorum aut imperato rum su{per}bia metus coe{per}it Egomet ī agmine at{que} in praelio consultor idem et socius {per}iculi vobiscū ad ero: me vos{que} omnibus in rebus iuxta gerā. Et pro∣fecto dijs iuuātibus: om∣nia matura sunt / victoria praeda / laus. Quaesi dubia: aut procul essent: tamen omnes bonos reip. subue∣nire deceret. Etenim ignauia nemo ī∣mortalis
factus est ne{que}  {quam} paens iberis / vti a erni forēt optauit / ma∣gis {quam} vti bn / honestique vitam exigerent. Plura dicerem Quirites si timidis virtutem ver∣ba adderēt. Nam strenu∣is abunde dictum puto. HViu semodi orati∣one habita / Marius post{quam} plebis aīos e∣rectos videt propere com matu / stipendio / armis / at{que} alijs vtilibus naues onera. Cum his Auium Manliū legatum proficisci iubet. ipse interea milites scri∣bere non more maiorum ne{que} ex claibus: sed vti cuusque libido erat: ca∣pite censos plerosque.
Id factum alij inopia bo∣norum: aj per ambitio∣nem cōsulis memorabāt {quod} ab eo genere celebra∣tus adutus que erat: et homini potētiam que∣renti egentissimus quis∣que oportunissimus: ui ne{que} sua chara (quippe q̄ nulla sunt) et oīa cū pre∣cio honesta videntur. Igitur marius cum ali∣quanto maiore numero {quam} decretū erat / in Aphri∣cam profectus: paucis di∣ebus Vticam aduehit̄. Exercitus ei traditur a Publio Rutilio legato: nam Metellus prospectū Marij fugerat: ne vide∣ret ea / quae audita anim{us} tolerate nequiuerat. Sed consul / expletis legi∣onibus cohortibus que auxiliarijs / in agrū fer∣tilem et praeda onustum proficiscitur: oīa ibi ca∣pta militibus donat. Deinde castella et oppi∣da parū munita natura et viris aggreditur: prae∣lia multa caeterum alia luia locis facere. Inte∣rim noui milites sine me∣tu pugne adesse: videre fugientes capi aut oci∣di: fortisimū quem{que} tu∣tissimū: armis / libertatem patriam / parētes{que} / et a∣lia oīa tegi: gloriam at{que} diuitias queri. Sic breui spacio / nou / veteresque coaluere: et virts oīm aequalis facta. At reges
vbi de aduentu Marij co∣gnouere: diuersi in locos difficiles abeunt. Ita Iugurthae placuerat speranti▪ mox esfusos ho∣stis inuadi posse romanos sicuti pleros{que} remoto me¦tu laxius licentiusque iuros. MEtellus intetea Ro¦mā profectus: con∣tra spem suam laetis¦simis ais excipitur plebi pr̄ibus{que} post{quam} inudia de∣cesserat: iuxta charus. Sed Marius impigre pru¦denter que suorum et ho∣stium res patiter attēde∣re: cognoscere / quid vtri∣que boni▪ aut cōtra esset. explorare itinera regum / consilia et insidias ante venie. Nihil apud se¦rmisum / neque apud il∣los tutum pati. Itaque et getulos et Iu∣gurthā praedas agētes ex socijs r̄is / saepe aggre{us} itinere suderat: ipsum{que} regē haud procul ab op∣pido Cirtha arms exe∣rat. Quae post{quam} gloriosa modo facta sut: ne{que} bel∣li copiam patrādi cogno∣uit: statuit vrbes / quae vi∣ris aut loco pro hostibus / et aduersum se oportu∣nissime erāt singulas cir∣cumuenire:
ita ratus / aut Iugurtham praesidijs nu¦datum / si ea pateret / aut praelio certaturum. Nam Bocchus nuncios ad eum saepe miserat / vel∣le populiro. amicitiam. ne quid a se hostile time∣ret. Id simulauerit ne / quo in∣prouisus grauior accede∣ret: an mobilitate inge∣nij / pacem atque bellum mutare solitus / parū ex∣ploratum est. Sed consul / vt cōstituerat▪ oppida ca∣stella{que} munita adire par¦tim vi: alia metu aut pre∣mia ostentando auertere abhostibus. A primo mediocria ge∣rebat: existimans Iugur∣tham ob suos tutādes in manus venturum / sed vbi illum procul abesse / et a∣lijs negotijs intētum ac∣cepit: maior et magis a∣spera aggredi tempus vi∣sum est. Erat inter ingētes so∣litudines oppidū ma¦gnū at{que} valens / noīe Capsa / cuius cōditor Her¦cules libys memorabat. Eius ciues apud Iugur∣tham immunes leni īpe∣rio: et ob ea fidelissimi
habebantur: muniti ad∣uersum hostes non moeni bus modo et armis at{que} viris: verum etiam multo magis aspitate loco. Nam proeter oppido loca propiqua: alia omnia va∣sta: inculta: egentia aquae: infesta a serpētibus: quo∣rum vis (sicuti omnium ferarum) inopia cibi acri∣or. Ad hoc natura serpē∣tium {per}niciosa: siti magis {quam} alia re accenditur. Eius potiundi Marium maxima cupido inuase∣rat: tum propter usum bel¦li: tum quia res aspera vi debatur. et Metellus op∣pidum Thalam magna gloria coeperat: haud dis∣similiter situm munitum∣que: nisi {quod} apud Thalam non longe a moenibus a∣liquot sontes erant. Ca∣psences vna modo atque ea intra oppidum rugi a∣qua: caeteri pluuia vtebā¦tur. Id ibi{que} et in Aphri∣ca quae procul a mari in∣cultius agebat) eo sacili¦us tolerabatur: quia nu∣midae plerūque lacte et fe¦rina carne vescebant: et ne{que} salem ne{que} alia irri∣tamēta gule quaerebant: cibus potus{que} illis aduer∣sus famē at{que} sitim nō li∣bidini ne{que} luxurie erat. Igitur cōsul omnibus ex¦ploratis credo dijs fret{us}.
Nam contra tantas dif∣ficultates consilio satis prouidere non poterat (quippe etiam frumenti inopia tētabatur / {quod} Nu∣midae pabulo pecoris / ma¦gis {quam} aruo student. Et quodcū{que} semē natum fuerat / iussu regis in loca munita contulerant. Ager autē aridus / et fru∣gum vacuus / ea tēpestate: nam aestatis extremum e∣rat). Tamē pro rei copia satis prouidenter exor∣nat. Pecus omne / quod superioribus praedae fue∣rat: equitibus auxiliari∣is agendum distribuit. Aulum Manlium legatū cum cohortibus expedi∣tis ad oppidum Larim (vbi stipendium et cōme∣atum locauerat) ire iu∣bet: dicit{que} se praedabun∣dum▪ post paucos dies eo∣dem vēturum. Sic incoe∣pto suo occultato / pergit ad flumen Tanam. Caeterū in itinere quoti∣die quadraginta duū pe∣cus exercitui per centu∣rias / item {per} turmas aequa¦liter distribuerat: et ex corijs vtres vti fie∣rent / curabat: simul et in∣opiam frumēti lenire: et ignaris omnibus parare / quae mox vsui forent.

Ibi castris leui munimē∣to positis milites cibum capere at{que} vti simul cum occasu solis egrederētur paratos esse iubet: omni¦b{us} abiectis sarcinis aqua modo se{que} et iumēta one∣rare. Deinde post{quam} visū est tem¦pus castris egreditur: no∣ctem{que} totam itinere fa∣cto consedit. Idem proxi∣ma facit. Deinde tertia multo ante lucis aduen∣tum peruenit in locū tu∣mulosum / longe a Capsa non amplius duum mili∣um interuallo: ibique {quam} occultissime potest / cum omnibus copijs diem op∣peritur. Sed vbi dies coe∣pit / et Numidae nihil ho∣stile metuentes / multi op¦pido egressi: repente om∣nem equitatum: et cū his velocissimos pedites cur∣su tendere ad Capsam: et portas obsidere iubet. Deinde ipse intent{us} pro¦pere sequi / ne{que} milites p̄∣dari sinere. Quae post{quam} oppidani cognouere: res trepidae metus ingēs: ma¦lum improuisum. Ad hoc pars ciuiū extra moenia in hostium pote∣state deprehensa / cogere vti deditionem facerent. Caeterum oppidum incē sum. Numide puberes in terfecti: alij omnes venū dati praeda militibus di∣uisa. Id facinus contra ius belli▪ nō auaritia▪ ne∣{que} scelere consulis / est ad∣missū: sed quia locus Iu∣gurthae opportunus: no∣bis aditu difficilis: gen{us} hominum mobile / infidū ante: ne{que} beneficio▪ ne{que} metu coercitum.
POst {quam} tantam rem pe egit Marius / sine vllo suorum incommodo: magnus et clarus antea / maior clarior{que} haberi e pit. Oia non bene consul∣ta modo / verumetiam ca∣su data / in virtutem tra∣hebantur. Milites modesto imperio habiti: simul et locuple∣tes ad coelū ferre Mariū. Numidae magis {quam} vllum mortalem timere postre∣mo omnes socij: ar{que} ho∣stes credere / illi aut men tem diuinam esse / aut de∣o{rum} nutu cuncta portēdi. Sed consul: vbi ea res be∣ne euenit: ad alia oppida pergit: pauca / repugnāti∣bus Numidis / capit: plura propter capsensiū miseras igni corrumpit. luctu atque caede omnia complentur.
Denique multis locis po¦titus ac peris{que} exercitu incruento: aliam rem ag∣greditur / non eadem as{per}∣itare qua capsens / cae∣terum haud secus diffici∣lem. Nan{que} haud longe a flumīe Mulucha (quod Iugurthae Bocchique re∣gnum disiungebat) erat inter ceteram planiciem mōs saxus▪ mediocri ca∣stello: satis patens in im∣mensum editus: vno per angusto aditu relicto. Nam per omnia natura velut opere atque con∣sulto / praeceps erat quem locum Marius / {quod} ibi re∣gis thesauri erant sum∣ma vi capere intēdit: sed ea res forte {quam} cōso me∣lius gesta erat. Nam in castello virorum atque armorū satis ma∣gna vis▪ et frumenti: et fons aque: aggeribus / turribus{que} et alijs machi nationibus locus impor∣tunus.

Milites ne{que} pro o{per}e con∣sistere propter iniquita∣tem loci: ne{que} inter vine∣a sine periculo admini∣strare: optimus qui{que} ca∣dere aut saciari: caete∣ris metus augeri.
At Marius / multis diebus & laboribus consumti anxius trahere cum ani∣mo suo omitteret ne īcoe∣ptum: qm̄ frustra erat: an fortunam ex{per}iretur qua saepe prospera vsus fue∣rat. Quae quum multos dies noctes{que} aestuās agitaret: ote quidam ligu ex co horribus auxiliarijs / mi∣les gregarius aliquantu∣lū egresus castris / haud procul a latere castelli quod aduersum praelian∣tib{us} erat: aīaduertit in∣ter saxa repētes cocleas quarum cū vnam atque alterā: deinde plures pe∣teret studio legerdi pau∣latim prope ad sūmū mō tis egrellus est. Vbi post{quam} solitudinē in∣tellexit more ingenij hu¦mani cupido difficilia fa¦ciundi animum vertit. Et forte in o loco gran∣dis lex coaluerat / inter saxa / paululū modo pro∣na: dinde flexa at{que} au∣cta in altitudinē▪ quo cū∣cta gignētū natura fert. Cuius ramis modo: mo∣do eminentibus saxis ni∣xus Ligur / castelli plani∣cem perscripst {quod} cuncti Numidae itenti praelian∣tibus aderant.
Expioratis omnib{us} quae mox vsui fore ducebat: eodem regreditur non te¦mere / vti ascenderat: sed tentans omnia et circum¦spiciens. Ita{que} propere adit Mari∣um: acta edocet: hortatur ab ea parte / qua ipe descē¦derat / castellū tētet: pol∣licetur se ducem itineris: periculique nihil esse. Marius cum ligure pro∣missa eius cognitū ex pre¦sentibus misit: quorū / vti cuius{que} ingenium erat: i∣tarem difficilem aut fa∣cilem nunciare. Consulis tamen animus paululum arrectus est. Ita{que} ex copia tubicinum et cornicinum quin{que} nu∣mero {quam} velocissimos de∣legit: et cum his / praesidio qui forent quatnor cen∣turiones: omnes{que} liguri parere iubet: et ei nego∣tio proximum diem con∣stituit. Sed vbi ex praecepto du∣cis tempus visum est pa∣ratis compositis{que} oibus ad locum pergit. Caeterū illi qui centurijs praeerāt edocti a duce / arma orna∣tum{que} mutauerunt / capi∣te at{que} pedibus nudis / vti prospectus nixusque per saxa facilius oret.
Su{per} terga gladij & scuta: verū ea numidica excori∣js pōderis gratia: simul et offēsa quo leurus se∣perēt. Igitur praegrediēs ligur / saxa / et si {quam} vetusta te radices eminebāt / laq̄∣is vīciebat: quib{us} alleua∣ti milites facilius ascen∣derent: interdū timidos insolentia itineris leua∣re manu. vbi paulo aspe∣rior ascensus erat / singu∣los prae se inermes mitte re Deinde ipse cū illorū armis sequi. q̄ dubia ni∣xu videbātur / potissimum tentare / ac saepius eadem ascendens et descēdens: deinde statim di grediēs caeteris audaciā addere. Igitur diu multum{que} fa∣tigati / tandem in castellū perueniunt desertum ab ea parte / {quod} sicut alijs die bus / omnes aduersum ho∣stes aderant. Marius vbi ex nuneijs ea quae ligur agerat / cogno∣uit {quam} {quam} tota die intentos praelio suos habuerat: tū vero cohortatus est mili∣tes: etipse extra vineas egress{us} testudine acta suc cedere: et simul hostem tormentis / sagittarijs{que}: et sunditoribus eminus terrere. At Numidae / saepe antea vineis Romanorum sub¦uersis / item incensis / non
castelli moenibus sese tu∣tabantur: sed pro muro dies nocles{que} agitare: ac Romanis mledicere: Mario vecordiam obie∣ctare: militibus nr̄is ser∣uitium Iugurthae minari secundis rebus feroces esse. Interim oibus rema¦nis hostibus{que} praelio in∣tētis: vi vtrin{que}: pro glo∣ria pro imperio his: illis pro salute rertantibus: repente a tergo signa ca∣nere: ac primo mulieres et pu∣eri qui visum processerāt fugere Deinde vti quis∣{que} muro proximus erat: post remo cūcti armati in ermes{que}: quod vbi acce∣dit: eo acrius instare ro∣mani: fundere ac pleros que tantummodo saucia¦re. Deinde super occiso∣rū vadere corpora: auidi gloriae: certantes murum ascendere: neque quem{quam} omnium praeda morari. Sic forte correpta Ma∣rij temeritas gloriam ex culpa inuenit.
CAeterū dum ea res agitur: Lucius Silla questor cum magno equitatu in castra venit qui / vti ex lation et socijs exercitū cogeret / Romae relictus erat. Sed quoniam nos tanti viri res admonuit idone¦um visum est de natura cultuque eius paucis di∣cere. Ne{que} enim alio lo∣co de Syllae rebus dictu∣ri sumus. Et Lucius Si∣senna optime et diligen∣tissime omnium / qui eas res dixere {per}secutus: pa∣rū mihi libero ore locu∣tus videtur. Igitur Sylla gētis patri∣ciae nobilis fuit: familia prope iam extincta maio¦rum ignauia. Literis graecis at{que} latiis iuxta atque doctissime e∣ruditus animo ingēti cu∣pidus voluptatū: sed glo¦riae cupidior: ocio luxu∣rios{us} esse tamen ab nego¦tijs nū{quam} voluptas remo∣rata ē nisi {quod} de vxore po¦tuit honestius consuli. Eacundus callidus: et a∣micicia facilis: ad simu∣landa negocia altitudo ingenij incredibilis mul¦tarum rerum / ac maxime pecuniae largitor at{que} il∣li foelecissimo omniū an∣te ciuilem victoriam nū∣{quam} super industriam fortu¦na fuit: multi{que} dubita∣uere / fortior an foelicior esset.
Nam postea quae fecerat incertum habeo: pudeat magan pigeat disserere. Igit Sylla (vt supra di∣ctum est) post{quam} in Affricā at{que} in castra Marij cum equitatu venit rudis an∣te et ignarus belli: soler∣tissimus omnium in pau∣cis tempestatibus factus est. Ad hoc milites beni∣gne appellare: multis ro∣gantibus▪ alijs ip̄e per sedare beneficia: inuitus ac∣ci pere: sed ea properanti us {quam} aes mutuum reddere: ipse a nullo repetere: magis laborate id / vt illi {quam} plutimi deberent: oca atque seria cum humilli∣mis agere. In operib{us}: in acie atque ad vigilias mult{us} adesse ne{que} iterim (quod praua ambitio solet) consulis aut cuius{quam} boni famā lae∣dere:
tāt imod o cōsilio ne∣{que} manu priorem aliū pa∣ti: pleros{que} anteuenire. Quibus rebus et artibus breui Mario et militibus carissimus factus est. AT Iugurtha post{quam} oppidum Capam aliosque munitos et sibi vtiles / simul et pe∣cuniam magnā amiserat ad Bocchū nūcios mittit {quam} primū in numidiam co¦pias adduceret. Praelij fa¦ciendi tēpus adesse. Quē vbi cūctari accepit: et du∣biū belli at{que} pacis ratio∣nes trahere: rur sus / vti an tea proximos eius donis corrumpit. Ipsi{que} Boccho pollicetur numidae tertiam partem si aut romani aphrica ex¦pulsi / aut integris suis fi∣nibus bellum composi∣tum foret. Eo praemio il∣lectus Bocchus / cum ma∣gna multitudine Iugur∣tam accedit. Ita ambo∣rum exercitu coniuncto Marium iam in hiberna proficiscentem / vix deci∣ma parte diei relicta / in∣uadunt: rati noctem quae iam aderat / et victis sibi munimento fore: et si vi∣cissent: nullo impedimen¦to: {quod} loco{rum} sciētes erant. Contra romanis vtrum{que}
casum in tenebris diffici∣lem ore. Igitur simul cō∣sul ex multis de hostium aduentu cognouit / et ipsi hostes aderant et prius{quam} exercitus aut instrui aut sarcinas colligere: deni∣que ante {quam} signum aut imperium vilum accipe∣re quiuit: Equites mauri at{que} getuli: non acie ne{que} vllo more praelij: sed ca∣teruatim▪ vti quos{que} sors cōglobauerat: in nostros concurrunt. Qui omnes trepidi improuiso metu: attamen virtutis memo∣res: aut arma capiebant: aut capiētes illos ab ho∣stibus defensabant. Pars equos ascēdere: ob∣uiam ire hostibus: pugna latrocinio magis {quam} prae∣lio similis fieri: sine si∣gnis: sine ordinibus equi¦es pedites{que} permisti cae∣dere alios: alios obtrūcare: multos contra aduersos acerrīe pugnantes ab tergo cir∣cūuenire: ne{que} virtus: ne∣que arma satis tegere: {quod} hostes numero plures / et vndi{que} circum fusi erant. Deni{que} romani veteres: noui{que} et ob ea scientes beli / si quos locus aut ca∣sus coniunxerat: orbes fa¦cere. Atque ita ab oibus parti¦bus simul et tecti et istru∣cti hostiū vim sustētabāt. Ne{que} ī eo tā aspero nego∣tio Marius territus: aut magis {quam} antea dimisso a∣nimo fuit: sed cum turma sua (quam ex sortissimis:
magis {quam} ex familiarissi∣mis {per}auerat) vagari passim: ac modo suis laborātibus succur∣rere: modo hostes / vbi cō∣fertissimi obstiterant / in∣uadere: manu cōsulere militibus quoniā imperare cōtur∣batis oībus non poterat. Iam{que} die consumptus erat cum tamen barbari nihil remittere: at{que} vti reges praeceperant: noctē pro se rati acrius instare. Tum Marus ex copia re∣rum consilia trahit: at{que} vti suis recptui locus es¦set: colles duos propin∣quos inter se occupat. Quorū in vno castris pa¦rū amplo foris aquae ma∣gnus erat: alter vsui o∣portunior: quia magna parte editus et praecepa pauca munimenta gere∣bat. Caeterum apud aquā Syl∣lam cū equitibus noctem agitare iubet. Ipse dis{per}∣sos milites paulatim / non minus hostibus cōturba∣tis / in vnum contrahit.
Deinde cūctos plen gra¦du in collem subducit. Ita reges loci difficulta∣te coacti / praelio deterrē∣tur: ne{que} tamen suos lon∣gius abire sinunt. Sed vtro{que} colle multitudine circundato / effusi conse∣dere. Deinde crebris ignibus factis plerū{que} noctis bar∣bari more suo laetari: ex∣ultare: strepere pedibus: vocibus: et ipsi reges fe∣roces / {quod} non fugerāt pro victoribus agere. Sed ea cūcta romanis ex tenebris editioribus lo∣cis facilia visu magno{que} hortamento erant. Plurimum vero Marius imperitia hostium cōfir∣matus / {quam} maximum scilē∣tium haberi iubet: ne si∣gn quidem / vti per vigi∣lias solebant / canere. Deinde vbi lux aduenta∣bat: defessis iam hostibus ac paulo ante somno ca∣ptis: de improuiso victi∣gales: item cohortū tur∣marum: legionum tubici∣nes simul omnes tuba ca¦nere et milites clamorē tollere aut portis erum∣pere.
Mauri atque getuli igno¦to at{que} horribili sonitu repente exciti / neque fu∣gere / ne{que} arma capere ne¦{que} omnino facere / aut pro¦uidere quic{quam} poterāt: ita cunctos strepitu / clamore nullo subueniēte▪ nr̄is in∣stantibus tumultu: terro∣re: formidine: quasi ve∣cordia acceperat. Deni{que} omnes fusi fuga∣ti{que} arma et signa milita¦ria plera{que} capta: plures{que} in eo praelio {quam} omnibus superioribus interempti sunt. Nam sōno et metu insolito impedita fuga. DEinde Marius / vti ceperat / inhiberna it propter commea¦tum. in oppidis mari ti∣mis agere decreuit: ne∣que tamē victoria seco aut insolens factus: sed pariter ac si in conspectu hostium quadrato agmi∣ne incedere. Sylla cū equitatu apud dextimos: in sinistra par∣te Aulus Manlius cū fun¦ditoribus et sagittarijs: praeterea cohortes ligu∣rum curabat. Primos et extremos cum expeditis manipulis tribunos loca¦uerat. Perfugae regio∣num
scientissimi hostium iter explorabant. Simul consul / quasi nullo impo∣sito / omnia prouidere: a∣pud omnes ad esse: lauda∣re fortis: et īcrepare moe∣rentis. Ipse armatus in∣tētus{que}. Item milites co∣gebat / ne{que} secus at{que} iter faceret castra munire: ex¦cubitum in porta cohor∣tes ex legionibus: pro ca¦stris equites auxiliarios mittere praeterea alios ī munimentis su{per} vallum locare vigilias ipse circū ire: non tā difridentia fu∣urum / quae imperauisset {quam} vti militibus exaequa∣tus cum imperatore la∣bor volentibus esset. Et sane Mari{us} illo alijs∣{que} t{per}ibus iugurthini bel∣li mag{is} pudore {quam} malo ex¦ercitum cociceat: quod multi {per} ābitionē aebant alij  {quod} a pueritia cōsuetā duritiā / & ali / que caeteri miserias vocāt: volupta¦ti habuisset: nisi tn̄ reip. pariter ac saeuissimo im{per} o bene at{que} decore oīa ge¦stá sunt. Igitur quarto deni{que} die haud lōge ab oppido Cir¦tha vndi{que} simul specula tores citi sese ostendunt.
Quare hostis adesse ītel∣legitur. Sed quia diuersi redeuntes / alius ab alia parte / atque omnes idem significabant: consul in∣certus / quonāmodo acrē instrueret: nullo ordine cōmutato: aduersum oīa paratus ibidem opperit. Ita Iugurthae spes fru∣strata / qui copias in qua∣tuor partes distribuerat ratus ex oībus aeque ali∣os ab tergo hostibus ven∣turos. Interim Sylla quem pri∣mum hostes attigerāt / co∣hortatus suos turmatim {quam} maxie consertis equis ipse alij{que} mauros inua∣dunt: Caeteri in vno loco manē¦tes ab iaculis eminus e∣missis corpora tegere: et si qui in manus venerant obtruncare. Dū eo modo equites prae¦liantur Bocchus cum pe∣ditibus / quos Volux fili∣us eius adduxerat / neque in priore pugna in itine∣re morati affuerant: po∣stremam aciem romano{rum} inuadit: Tū Marius apud primos agebat: {quod} ibi Iugurtha cum plurimis erat. Deinde numida / cognito Bocchi aduentu / clam cū paucis ad pedites cōuer∣tit: ibi latine (nam apud numātiam loqui didice∣rat) exclamat nr̄os fru∣stra pugnare: ante paulo Marium sua manu inter
fectū: simul gladium san∣guine oblitum ostendere quem inpugna satis im∣pigre / occiso pedite nr̄o cruentauerat. Quod vbi milites accepere / mag{is} a∣trocitate rei {quam} fide nun∣tij terrētur: simul{que} bar∣bari animos extollere et in perculsos acrius inten¦dere. Iam{que} paululū a fuga ab erant cum Sylla (profli∣gatis his quos aduersum ierat rediens mauris ab latere incurrit. Bocchus stati auertitur. At Iugurtha dum susten∣tare suos: et prope iā ad∣eptam victoriam retine∣re cupit circumuētus ab equitibus dextra sinistra que omnibus occisis: so∣lus interteia hostium vi∣tabundus erupit. At{que} interim Marius / fu∣gatis equitibus / occurrit auxilio suis / quos pelli iam acceperat. Deni{que} hostes iam vndi{que} fusi sunt: tum spectacu∣lum horribile in campis patentibus: Sequi / fugere / occidi / ca∣pi / equi atque viri affli∣cti: ac multi vulneribus
acceptis▪ ne{que} sugere pos∣se: ne{que} quietem pati: niti modo ac statim con∣cidere: Postremo omnia / qua vi∣sus erat / constrata telis▪ armis / cadaueribus / & in¦terea humus infecta san∣guine. POstea loci cōsul haud dubie iā victor perue¦nit in oppidū Cyrthā quo in initio profectus ī∣tēderat: eo post quintū di¦em quā iterū barbari ma¦le pugnauerant / legati a Boccho veniunt qui reg{is} verbis ab Mario petiere: duos {quam} fidissimos ad eum mittere: velle de suo et de populi romani cōmo∣do cum his disserere. Il∣le statim Lucium Syllā / & Aulum Manliū ire iu∣bet. Qui {quam}{quam} acciti ibant tamen placuit verba a∣pud regem facere: quo in∣genium aut aduersum fle¦cterent: aut cupidum pa∣cis vehemētius accende¦rent. Ita{que} Sylla cuius facun∣diae non etati a Manlio concessum est: verba pau∣ca huiuscemodi locutus est.
REx Bocche magna nobis laeticia est: cū te talē virū dij mo∣nuere: vt aliquādo pacē {quam} bellū malles neu te opti∣mū cum pessimo oīm Iu∣gurtham miscendo cōma culares. Simul nobis de∣meres acerbam necessitu dinem: pariter et te errā¦tem / et illum sceleratissi∣mum {per}sequi. Ad hoc po∣pulo romano iam a prin∣cipio inopi: melius visū amicos {quam} seruos quaerere tutius{que} rati volentibus {quam} coactis imperitare. Tibi vero nulla opportu∣nior amicitia nostra: pri∣mum {quod} procul absumus in quo offensae minimum est: et gratia par / ac si pro∣pe adessemus. deīde {quod} pa∣rētes abunde habemus. Amicorum ne{que} nobis ne¦que cui{quam} hoim satis fuit Atque hoc vtinam tibi a principio placuisset: pro∣fecto ex populo romano ad hoc tēpus multo plu∣ra bona accepisses: {quam} ma∣la perpessus esses. Sed quoniam humanarū rerum fortuna pieraque regit: cui scilicet placuit vim et gratiam nostram te experiri nunc quoniā per illam licet / festina at∣{que} vti coepisti / perge. Multa opportuna habes quo facilius errata offi∣cijs superes.
postrēo haec in pectus tu∣um demitte nun{quam} popu∣lum romanum beneficijs victum esse. Nam bello {quam} valeat tute scis. ADea Bocchus pla∣cide et benigne / si∣mul pauca pro de∣licto suo verba facit: se nō hostili aīo / sed ad regnū tutandum arma cepisse. Nam Numidiae partem vnde Iugurtham expule∣rit / iure belli suam factam eam vastari a Mario pati nequiuisse. Praeterea missis antea ro¦mam legatis / repulsū ab amicitia. Caeterum vete¦ra omittere: actun si per Marium liceret / legatos ad senatum missurum. Deinde copia facta mit∣tendi / animus barbari ab amicis flexus / quos Iu∣gurtha cognita legatio∣ne Syllae et Manlij metu∣ens id / quod parabat / do∣nis corruperat.
MArius interea exe¦citu in hibernis cō∣posito / cū expeditis cohortib{us} et {per}e equita∣rus {pro}ficiscitur in loca so∣la / obseiū turrim regiam quo Iugurtha perfugas oēs praesidium imposue∣rat. Tum rursus Bocchus scilicet erga romāos seu reputando / quae sibi duo∣bus praelijs euenerāt seu monitus ab alijs amicis quos Iugurtha incorru∣ptos reliquerat / ex omni copia necessariorum / qui∣{que} delegit: quorum et i∣des cognita / et igenia va∣lidissima erat. Eos ad Marium: ac deinde si pla∣ceat / Romam legatos ire iubet: agendarum rerum et quocun{que} modo belli componendi licēciam {per}∣mittit. illi mature ad hy∣berna tomanorum profi∣ciscuntur. Deinde in iti∣nere a Getulis latronib{us} circumuenti / spoliatique pauidi sine decore ad syl∣lam profugiūt: quem cō∣sul inexpeditionem pro∣ficiscens pro praetore re∣liquerat. Eos ille nō pro vanis hostibus vti meri∣ti erāt / sed liberaliter ha∣buit. Quare barbari et famam romanorū auaritiae fal∣sam et Syllam ob munifi centiam in sese amicum esse rati suut. Nā etiam tū largitio multis igno∣ra erat. munificus etiam nemo putabatur / nisi pa∣riter volens dona omnia ī benignitate habebant̄. Igitur quaestori manda∣ta Bocchi patefaciunt: si∣mul ab eo petūt: vti fau∣tor
consultor{que} sibi adsit. copias / fidem / magnitudi∣nem regis sui: et alia / quae aut vtilia: aut beneuolen¦tiae esse credebant: orati∣one extollunt. Deinde Sylla omnia pol∣licito: docti{que} quomodo apud Marium item apud senatum verba facerent circiter dies ibidem .xl. opperiuntur. MArius post{quam} / infecto negotio / quo intēde¦rat / redit Cyrthā: & de aduētu legatorū certi¦or fact{us} est ilios{que} & Syllā ab Vtica venire iubet itē{que} Luciū Bellienum prae∣torē praeterea omnes vn∣dique senatorij ordinis: quibuscum mādata Boc∣chi cognoscit: in quis le∣gatis potestas eundi Ro∣mam fit: et ab consule in¦terea induciae postulātur Ea Syllae et pleris{que} pla∣cuere. pauci ferocius de∣cernunt / ignari rerum hu¦manarum: quae fluxae et mobiles semper in aduer¦sa mutantur. Caeterum mauri / impetra¦tis omni rebus / tres Ro∣mam profecti / cum Cneo Octauio Rufo: qui quae∣stor stipendium in Aphri¦cam portauerat. Duo ad regē redeunt. Ex his Boc¦chus cum caetera: tū ma∣xime benignitatē: et stu∣dium Syllae libens acce∣pit. Romae{que} legatis eius post{quam} errasse regem et Iu¦gurthae scelere lapsū dep̄
ati sunt: amiciam et foe∣dus perentibus hoc mo∣do respondetur. Senatus et populus ro∣manus beneficij et iniu∣riae memor esse solet. Caeterum Boccho / quoni∣am poenitet delicti / grati¦am facit. foedus et amici∣tia dabūtur / cū meruerit. QVis rebus cogni∣tis / Bocchus {per} lit¦teras a Mario pe¦tiuit / vti Sillam ad se mit∣teret. Cuius arbitratu de negotijs cōmunibus cōsu¦leret. Is miss{us} cū p̄sidio e∣quitū at{que} peditū: itē fun∣dito{rum} et balistario{rum}. Pre¦terea iere sagittarij: & co¦hors peligna cū velitari∣bus armis itineris prope¦rādi causa ne{que} sec{us} his / at¦{que} alijs armis aduersū te∣la hostiū{quod} ea leuia sūt mu¦niti erant. Sed in itinere / quinto denique die / Volux filius Bocchi repente in campis paten∣tibus cum mille non am∣plius equitibus sese ostē∣dit: qui temere et effuse euntes / Syllae alijs{que} om∣nibus et numerum ampli∣orem: et hostilem metum efficiebant. Igit se quis∣que expedite: arma at{que} tela tentare: intendere: timor aliquātus / sed spes amplior: quippe victori∣bus et aduersū eos / quos saepe vicerant. Interim equites exploratum pre∣missi / rem / vti erat / quiet ā
nuntiant. Volux adueni¦ens / quaestorem appellat: dicit{que} se a patre Boccho obuiam illi / simul et prae∣sidio missum. Deinde per illū et proximū diē sine metu comuncti eunt. Post vbi castra locata: et diei vesper erat repēte Mau∣rus incerto vultu pauēs ad Syllam accurrit dicit∣{que} sibi a speculatorib{us} co∣gnitū haud procul Iugur tham abesse. Simul vti noctu clam secum profu∣geret / rogat at{que} hortat. Ille animo feroci negat se toties susum numidam pertimesere: virtuti suo¦rum satis credere: etiam si certa pestis adesset mā∣surum potius {quam} pro ditis his / quos ducebat turpi fuga / incertae / ac forsitan post paulo īteriturae mor∣bo / vitae parceret. Caete{rum} ab eodē monitus / vti no∣ctu prosicisceretur: consi∣lium approbat: ac statim milites coenatus esse ī ca¦stris: ignes{que} {quam} creberri mos fieri: deinde prīa vi∣gilia silētio egredi iubet. Iam{que} nocturno itinere fesis omnibus / Sylla pa∣riter cum ortu solis ca∣stra metabatur: cū equi∣tes mauri nunciant / Iu∣gurtham circiter duum milium interuallo ante eos consedisse. Quod post{quam} auditum est: tū ve∣ro ingens metus nostros inuadit: credere se prodi¦tos a Voluce / et insidijs circumuentos. Ac fuere qui dicerēt manu vindi∣candum ne{que} apud illum
tantum scelus inultū re∣linquendum. At Sylla {quam} {quam} eadem existimabat / tn̄ ab īuria maurum prohibet suos hortatur / vti fortem animum gererent. Saepe antea paucis strēnuis ad¦uersus multitudinem be∣ne pugnatum▪ quanto si∣bi in praelio minus peper cissent: tāto tutiores fo∣re. ne{que} quēquam decere qui manus armauerit / ab inermibus pedibus auxi∣lium ptere. in maximo metu nudum et cecū cor∣pus ad hostē vertere. De∣inde Volucem (qm̄ hosti∣lia faceret) louem maxi∣mū obtestatus: vt sceleris at{que} praefidiae Bocchi te∣stis adesset: castris abire iubet. Ille lacrimās ora∣re / ne ea crederet: nihil dolo factū: ac magis cal∣liditate Iugurthae / cui vi¦delicet speculāti iter su∣um cognitum esset. Caeterū quoniam ne{que} in∣gentem multitudinē ha∣beret & spes opes{que} ex pa¦tre suo penderent crede∣ret illum nihil palam au∣surum: cum ipse filius te∣stis adesset. Quare opti∣mum factu videri per me¦dia ei{us} castra palam trā∣sire sese / v praemissis vel ibidē relictis mauris / so∣lum cum Sylla iturum. Ea res / vti ī tali negocio solet / probata est: ac statī profecti: quia de impro∣uiso acciderat / dubio at∣que hesitante Iugurtha / incolumes transeunt. Deīde paucis diebus quo ire intenderant / peruen∣tum est.
IBi cum Boccho quidā numida / Asper nomine multum et familiari∣ter agebat: praemissus a Iugurtha / post{quam} Syllā ac∣citum audierat / oratū / et subdole speculatum Boc∣chi consilia ierat. Praete∣rea Dabar / Massagradae filius / ex gente Massinis∣sae / caeterum materno ge∣nere impar (Nam mater eius ex eoncubina orta erat) Mauro ob ingentia facta charus acceptus{que} quem Bocchus fidū mul∣tis antea tempestatibus expertus illico ad Syl∣lam nunciatū mit tit pa∣ratū sese facere / quae po∣pulus romanus vellet col¦loquio: diem: locum: tem∣pus: ipse deligere consul to sese omnia cum illo in¦tegra habere neu Iugur∣thae legatum pertimesce∣ret: {quod} eo aduocatus esset quo res comunis licenti¦us gereretur: nam ab in∣sidijs eius aliter sibi ca∣uere nequiuisse. Sed ego cōperio Bocchū magis punica fide: {quam} ob ea quae praedicabat / simul romanos et numidam sp pacis detinuisse multum∣{que} cum suo animo volue∣re solitū Iugurtham ro∣manis / an illi Syllam tra¦deret: libidinem aduersū nos: metū pro nobis sua∣sisse. Igitur Sylla respōdit / s pauca coram aspare lo∣cuturum caetera occulte aut nullo praesente / aut {quam} paucissimis: simul edo∣cet: q̄ sibi responderent.
Post{quam} sicuti voluerat cō∣grei: dicit se missū a cō∣sule / venisse quae situm ab eo / pacem an bellum agi∣taturus foret. Tum rex (vti praeceprum fuerat) post diem decimum redi∣re iubet. At nihil etiam dcreu isse: sed illo die re¦sponsurum. Deinde ambo ad castra sua degressi. SEd vbi plerum{que} no∣ctis processit Sylla a Boccho occulte accer¦sit ab vtro{que} tantūmodo fidi interp̄tes adhibent. Praeterea Dabar internū¦cius / sanctus vi / iurat ex sentētia ambobus: acsta∣tim sic rex incipit. Nun{quam} ego ratus sum o∣re / vti rex maximus ī hac terra / et omniū, quos no∣ui, opulentissimus priua¦to homini gratiam debe∣rē: et me hecle Sylla / an∣te te cognitum / multis o∣rātibus / alijs vltro / ego∣met opem tuli: nullius ī∣digui. Id esse imminutum / quod caeteri dolere solent / ego letor: fuerit mihi eguisse aliquando praecium tuae amicitiae: qua apud ani∣mum
meum nihil chari{us} habeo: id adeo experir li¦cet arma: viros: pecuniā postremo quicquid aīo li¦bet sume: vtere: et quo ad viues nun{quam} tibi reddi tam gratiam putaueris: sed semper apud me inte∣gra erit. Deni{que} nihil me sciente frustra voles. Nam vt ego existimo re∣gem armis {quam} munificen∣tia vinci minus flagitio∣sum. Caeterū de republica ve∣stra cui{us} curator huc mis¦sus es paucis accipe. Bel∣lum ego populo romano ne{que} feci ne{que} factum vn∣{quam} volui fines meos ad∣uersum armatos tutatus sum. Id omitto quoniam ita vobis placet. Gerite vti vultis cum Iugurtha bellum. ego flumen Mu∣lucham quod inter me et Micipsam suit non egre∣diar. Deni{que} id Iugurthā intrare sinam. Praeterea si quid me vobis{que} dignū peiueris haud repuisus abibis. Ad ea Sylla pro se breui∣ter et modice: de pace de q: cōmunibus rebus mul∣tis disseruit. Denique regi patefecit: quod polliceatur senatū et pplm romanum: quo∣niam armis amplius va∣luissent non in gratiam habiturum: aciendum a∣liquid quod illorum ma∣gis {quam} sua retulisse videre tur: id adeo in prompt esse quoniam Iugurth copiam haberet: quem si
romanis tradidisset fore vt illi plurimum de beret amicitiam: sedus: Numi∣diae partem quam nunc peteret: tunc vltro aduen¦turam. Rex primo negare agita¦re cognitionem affinita¦tem praeterea foedus īter¦uenisse. Ad hoc metuere ne fluxa fide vsus popu∣lariū animos auerteret. quis et Iugurtha charus et romani inuisi erant. Deni{que} saepius fatigatus leuitr et ex voluntate Syliae omnia se fact urum promittit. Caeterum ad simulandum pacem cuius numida de∣fessus bello auidissimus erat: quae vtilia visa sunt constituunt. Ita compo∣sito dolo degrediuntur. AT rex postero die Asperē Iugurthae egatū appellat di¦cit{que} sibi {per} Dabarē ex Syl¦la cognitū posse cōditio∣nibus bellū sui sententiā exquireret. Ille laet{us} in ca¦stra Iugurthae {pro}ficiscit. Deinde cūcta ab illo edo∣ctus properato itinere post diem octauum redit ad Bocchum et ei nunci∣at Iugurthā cupere om∣nia quae imperarētur fa∣cere sed Mario parū con∣fidere. Saepe antea cū im∣peratoribus romanis pa∣cem cōuentam frustra fu¦isse. Caete{rum} Bocchus si am¦bobus consultā et atam pacem vellet: daret ope∣rā vt vna quasi de pace in
colloquium conneniret ibi{que} Syllā sibi traderet▪ cum talem virum in pote¦state habuisset tum fore vti iussu senatus ac po∣puli romani foed{us} fieret: ne{que} hominē nobilem nō sua ignauia captum: sed ob remp. in hostium pote¦state relictum ir. Haec Maurus secum ipse diu voluens tandem pro∣misit. Caeterum dolo an in re cunctatus parū cō∣perimus sed plerum{que} re∣giae voluntates vt vehe∣mentes sic mobiles: saepe ipie sibi aduersae. Postea tēpore et loco con¦stituo in colloquium vti de pace cōueniretnt Boc¦chus Syllam modo: mo∣do Iugurthae legatum ap¦pellare: benigne habere: idem ambobus polliceri: illi leti pariter ac spei bo¦nae esse pleni: sed nocte ea quae proxia uit ante di∣em colloquio decretum maurus adhibit{is} amicis ac statim immutata volū¦tate remotis a se caeteris dicitur secum multa agi∣tauisset: vultu / colore / ac motu cor{per}is pariter at{que} animo varius quae scili∣cet ipso tacente occulta pectoris oris immutatio¦ne patefecit. Tamen postremo Syllam accersiri iubet: et ex eiu sentencia numidae insidi as tendit. Deinde vbi dies aduenit et ei nunciatum Iugur∣tham haud longe esse cū paucis amicis et quaesto∣e

Caeteri obtrūcati Iugur∣tha vinctus Syllae tradi∣tu: et ab eo ad Marium deductus est.
¶Per idem tēpus aduer∣sum Gallos ab ducibu nostris Quīto Scipione / et Caio Manlio male pu¦gnatum est. Quo metu Italia omnis contremuerat. Illi{que} et denique omnes romani vs{que} ad nostram memoriam sic habuere: alia omnia virtuti sua prona esse: cū Galli pro salute non pro gloria cer¦tare. Sed postq̄ bellum in Nu∣midia cōfectum et Iugur¦tham Romam vinctū ad duci nuntiatum est. Ma∣rius consul absens factus est et ei decreta prouīcia gallia.
