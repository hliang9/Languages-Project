THE HUMBLE ADDRESS and RECOGNITION OF THE University of Oxford PRESENTED TO HIS SACRED MAJESTY JAMES II KING OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, and IRELAND Defender of the Faith, &c. According to an Act of Convocation bearing date, Feb. 21. in the year 1685. DOMMINA NVTIO TUMEA OXFORD, Printed at the THEATER, 1685.
May it please your Majesty, WE your Majesties most Duti∣full and Loyal Subjects your University of OXFORD, do here prostrate our selves at your Royal feet, to present with all humility this public testimony of our unfeigned sorrow for the Demise of our late dread Sovereign of blessed memory, and withal from the bottom of our hearts to adore, and magnify the Pro∣vidence of our good God, by whom Kings reign, who out of his unspeakable mercy to this Church and State, has preserved your Sacred Majesty in the Government of these Kingdoms. And as we can never swerve from the principles of our Institution in this place, and our Religion by Law establisht in the Church of England, which indispensably bind us to bear all Faith and true Obedience to our So∣vereign without any restrictions or limitations; so we cannot but most thankfully acknowledge that further
obligation your Majesty has laid upon us, by your Royal assurance to defend that Religion, which to the Joy of all our Hearts you have vouchsafed to give us in your late most gracious Declaration. Wherefore out of a deep and hearty sense of our boun∣den duty, as also of your Majesties most Princely Grace, and tenderness to your People; we presume to assure your Majesty, that no consideration whatsoever, shall be able to shake that stedfast Loyalty and Allegiance, which in the days of your blessed Father that Glorious Mar∣tyr, and in the late times of discrimination, stood here firm and unalterable to your Royal Brother and your Self, under the sharpest tryals: and that we shall con∣stantly (by Gods assistance) with our utmost zeal and fidelity improve all those advantages, wherewith God and your Majesty have entrusted us in this ancient Nur∣sery of learning; to promote the quiet, happiness, and security of your Majesties Reign over us. And Finally we shall never fail to be earnest sollici∣tors at the Throne of Grace, that it would please Al∣mighty God, who of his infinite Goodness hath setled You in peace upon the Throne of your Royal Ancestors; to be henceforth and for ever the defence and shield of his Anointed, to protect your Person, and prolong your days: and when You shall have finisht your course upon Earth in Peace, and Honour; to translate You from one Crown to another, to a never failing Crown of Glory in his everlasting Kingdom.
