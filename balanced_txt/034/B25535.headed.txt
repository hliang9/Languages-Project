KNowing the great abuses many have met with, languishing under this Allamode Disease, and for want of Cure have been totally Ruined; I have made it my Business in my Studies and Practice, to find out a means more Effectual than the common ways, which by God's assistance, with my Endeavours, I have attained to a most Expeditious, Safe, and Easie Method, by which I infallibly Cure the Venereal Pox or Clap, though never so far gone, or so long abused by others, and often Fluxed to no purpose; and if it has seized the Head, or other principal parts, attended with violent Pains, or Nodes, Swellings, Buboes, Shankers, or Ulcers, broke out in an hundred Places; I shall under God make a perfect Cure in a short time, or ask nothing for my Pains. But for the lesser degree of this Disease, termed a Clap or Running of the Reins, I cure at first in six or seven days, by a safe and secret Method, distinct from all others, without denial of Business, or giving the least suspi¦cion to any. I am to be spoken with any hour of the Day, (except from 12 till 3) at my House over against the sign of the Water-Tankard in Northumberland-Alley in Fan∣church-street, near Aldgate, there being Pales before the Window. Where those excellent Preparations for either of these Cures may be had at easie Rates, with Directions fitting for any Messenger, or a Cure will be un∣dertaken upon moderate terms, and performed with much safety, by him, who by his endeavours has found out better means than ever known to any before.
