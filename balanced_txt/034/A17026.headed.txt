THE INTRODVCTION to the true understanding of the whole Arte of Expedition in teaching to write. Intermixed with rare discourses of other matters, to shew the possibilitie of skill in teaching, and probabilitie of successe in learning, to write in 6. hours Which tending all to one end, doe serve for two uses. 1. If Authors doe excell others in their owne Artes, Why may not this Author excell others in his Arte. 2. For removing a vulgare opinion against his native coun∣trey of Scotland. he sheweth that it hath moe excellent Prerogatives than any other Kingdome. Whereby it will rather follow, that a Scotishman is so much the more able to prosecute whatsoever hee undertaketh, and therefore so much the more to bee respected, by how so much he is more ingenuous than one of another nation.

TO THE MOST ILLVSTRIOVS AND HOPEFVLL PRINCE, CHARLES Prince of WALES, &c. temporall prosperitie and endlesse felicitie. MAy it please your Highnesse? In regard that some have a sinister opinion of me in my profession, not only becaus of the pretended impossibility of the succes therof, but far more of that worthie nation, where all your Highnesse most royall Progenitors had their be∣ing, and whereof I also have the honour to be a native, and lest any either of their writings or speaches should come to your Highnesse sight or hearing, now in your ten∣der yeares, I have laboured heere to preuent them, by de∣fending both my Countrie and profession. Where as these things are propounded heere in the superlative degree, I suppose it is according to the pra∣ctise of worthy men in former times, when their persons, professions, countries, or causes have beene any wayes traduced, they have not only defended the same to the ut∣termost of their power, but even stretched all and what∣so-ever their properties priviledges, or liberties to the furthest extent, that their adversaries might bee either convinced or silenced. Whensoever it shall please God your Highnesse shall have occasion to use that antient nation, yea or any mem∣ber thereof (such as my self) in any service, I hope your Highnesse shall find us as faithfull, able and willing now, as our predecessors have beene to your Highnesse royall progenitours informer times.
Now in token of my goodwill and affection, I hum∣bly present your Highnesse with these my meane labours, that they may goe abroad under your Highnesse protecti∣on, and that it would please God to grant your Highnesse such gratious education, as you may bee an happie instru∣ment of his glorie in his owne good time, it shall be the fervent suite of Your Highnesse humble servant, DAVID BROVVN.

The summe of the Authors Profession of EXPEDITION, in teaching to Write. 1 HE teacheth those that can reade, and bee capable and carefull, to write any hand well in sixe houres, which they never wrote before, or to rectifie whatsoever hand they write already; each one in a severall roome, and halfe an houre at a time. 2 Others also hee teacheth in so much longer time, as they come short of such abilitie, capacitie, or using the meanes: which consists both in earnest performing their daily halfe hours taske, when they have best leysure betweene the times of teaching, and in carefull supplying the defect, losse, or neglect of any one time, by so much the more care and diligence at another time. 3 And those that cannot write at all, or not well, or not true English, neither can reade written hand, write without rule, nor keepe accounts, he teacheth to attaine all these better in one Month, an houre onely in a day, and as long by their owne pri∣vate practise, (when their affaires may bee least hindred) then they can by others, after the ordinary manner in three, though they should spend all the day, neglect all other businesse, and doe nothing else. All by true and exact method new Rules, and rare secrets of art; authorized by Supreme Authoritie; approved by the State, embraced by the Learned, attained by the Ignorant, and main∣tained by the Author & Professor, against all opposers and en∣vyers, strangers and others. For redeeming the time, and renewing the occasion of lear∣ning to all, but chiefly those of middle age, who have wanted, lost, or neglected either, in their youth, and cannot now spare long time to learne. He practiseth the most part of the day in the Terme time, and most of the after noone in the vacation, at the Cat and Fiddle in Fleet-street, and most of the forenoone, at his house in S. Iohns street, next above the Vnicorne, except when hee is invited to the Country at any time, especially in the long vacation. Whre likewise Mary Stewart and her daughters, doe in∣strut young Noble and Gentlewomen in good manners, lan∣guages, writing, & other qualities, by his assistance & direction.
THE INTRODVCTION to the true understanding of the whole Booke. Shewing (as in a prospect) both the pro∣bability of Expedition, in teaching, faire, short, and true writing; and the possibilitie of learning to write any hand in sixe houres. AS it hath pleased our gratious God of his great bounty, for his owne glory, and mans felicity, to pre∣ferre man to all his creatures on earth, and to adorne him with many excellent prerogatives, gifts, and faculties, farre above all the rest, such as wisedome, knowledge, and learning; so likewise he hath ordained all good Arts and Sciences, as speciall helps and ordina∣ry meanes whereby he may attaine thereunto, and so much the better, both enjoy a comfortable life here, and the hope of a happy life hereafter: for as hee ever appointeth the end, so he alwaies appointeth the means to come to the end. And since the knowledge and practise of Arts and Sciences, can neither be so well nor speedily attained,
as by using the ordinary meanes, prescribed by those whom it hath pleased God to raise up and indue with gifts above the rest in every age; and that by the help or instruction of such as have beene most expert for the time; and those who are expert in these dayes (now as well as in former times) are so rare, that they can scarcely be had, but only in some eminent Cities: and in no Arte or Science, are they more rare, then in this of writing, although it maintaineth all other Arts and Sciences. I therefore, not onely in consideratio of these, and many other motives, but likewise being further moved by the earnest in treaty of some vertuous min∣ded men, who now in their age, doe far more sensibly feele the want, neglect, or losse of time in their youth, then many others who are little more carefull yet, than they were then; and so much the rather, in that I appre∣hend some measure of ability in my selfe for their nea∣rest remedy or best recoverie, (as they are now) have thought it both a part of my duty to him of whom I have it, and very needfull and expedient for the good of all, being the chiefe end wherefore I received it, e∣ven to offer the same as a benefit to all, and that by publishing this Booke to the view of the world, that oth they, and all others, may make a profitable use thereof. For it may be, that many hundreths, who are both past the date of (going to schooles) and much employ∣ed about other businesses, will yet spare some conveni∣ent time to learne alone, by the helpe of this Booke; whereas (ither through distance of place, or other oc∣casions) searely one of them can come to me, or will goe to others: which whosoever readeth or practiseth, I wish it may be done orderly as it standeth, without any omission at all, and as little intermission as possibly may be, that the scope and substance of all, being once well conceived in the minde, it may be so much both speedier and better practised by the hand.
If either thou that diligently readest, or but lightly viewest, or yet any of you that heare or see this booke, be such as neither need, nor intend to learne; or other∣wise, if yee, or any of you be ignorant, and therefore yee apprehending your owne necessities, would faine learne, but want either meanes or opportunity; or yet be such as have both great need, and earnest desire, but too late for you now to begin: I could wish it might please you not to judge or censure this Booke, or bene∣fit offered therein, either as ye are, or shall be in any of these cases or conditions. But rather, as if ye your selves, or any of you had ei∣ther written the one, or offered the other, or perchance thrice so good as either; and would have me, or others of better judgement and discretion, to judge or censure those your workes or fruits thereof, and so esteeme of you accordingly. Or, as if Ye were to be learners, and did feele to your great griefe now, the want, losse, or neglect of learning formerly, and could get no other helpe (under God) to teach you. Ye were in danger to lose some good de∣signe, which if you could but write a legible hand, you might easily obtine. Ye were come to such age, as you would think it a disparagement to goe to schoole. Your affaires would not permit, though you would bee content to goe. You might spare some little time to learne this way, though no time any other way. Your children, friends, neighbours, or ser∣vants, stood in need of instrcting. Or, most of all, I wish ye may judge or censure this Booke or benefit, as it may be profitable to the Church or Common wealth, whereof you are members; for in that regard, it doth also concern you all, in what estate soever you are; yea, and the more wise or learned you be, I hope you will so much the better acknowledge,
that that which is a benefit to others (by the simpathy of fellow members) is also a benefit to you: and there∣fore ye are not onely to approve, but even to maintain also according to your power at all times and occasi∣ons, whatsoever is for the good of others, although neither any of you, not any of yours at some time or oc∣casion, have any particular need thereof your selves. But since that which is written, may indure, when the dayes of the actor, as well as the time of the action, will expire, who knoweth but that which I intend herein may both continue and doe good to many one, when neither my hand can write, nor my tongue speake to any at all? I will therefore take occasion (howsoever to doe my part, and not onely now begin whiles I have breath) by the meanes of writing, to write the speedy and true way, both of teaching and learning to write; but likewise use my best indeavours to performe it with all my power, for there is neither wisedome, worke, nor invention in the grave whither I goe; and referre both the continuance and event to God, who onely is eternall, and hath the successe of all things in his hands. Whom I humbly beseech so to guide and direct me, both in doing thereof, and whatsoever thing else I take in hand, that not onely I may set his Majestie al∣waies before my eyes, and keepe my selfe in the meane betweene these two extremities, even neither to de∣serve the name of a sluggard, by doing nothing (at least worth the name of any thing) nor yet to be wise in my owne conceit, in that hee hath given mee some measure of ability and grace to doe some thing: but likewise, that I may alwaies as justly say, as he know∣eth my desire is at this present, that whatsoever thing hee putteth in my hands to doe, may be done princi∣pally, or much rather, in obedience to him of whom I receive both the will and the deed; and secondarily, to make the best use thereof I can, both for my selfe and others, then any wise to affect singularity, either by the
raritie of the project it selfe (in thinking it matchlesse, or that it cannot be surmatched) or yet so much as by meanes thereof to claime any perishing title, preroga∣tive or preheminence at all which may not justly be at∣tributed unto the instrumentall, or any wise derogato∣rie to the principall efficient of what is done. Concerning the elements and contemplations of wri∣ting, whereby may be considered and observed the definitions, derivations, and divisions of the Arte, causes and occasions of the practise: I intend not much to insist in this first part, neither yet of the excellencie of writing in respect of the renowne, necessitie, utilitie, raritie, antiquity, universality, and noble discent ther∣of; because they are already illustrated in the second part, for onely the principles are briefly expressed here, but the reasons and use of all largely discussed there. Therefore, to be short in what I intend to say in this Preface to the commendation of writing (neither for want of matter nor cause, but rather for brevitie, and to shun repetition) I hope any of any breeding, will easi∣ly confesse, that by the blessing of God upon the ordi∣nary meanes of writing, (which it pleased himself, both as our blessed Creator and Redeemer to practise, and which all Emperours, Kings, Monarchs, Princes, No∣bles, and Gentles must, though they should practise no other art) we have not onely his blessed word written for our learning, that it may be a lanterne to our feete, and a light unto our pathes, both to direct us in the way of life, and how to shun the snares of death, But likewise thereby all high matters, of whatsoever nature or importance, are both intended & prosecuted, secret matters are secretly kept, friends that be a thou∣sand miles distant are conferred with, and (after a sort) visited, the excellent workes of godly men, the grave sentences of wise men, and the profitable arts of lear∣ned men, who died a thousand yeeres agoe, are yet ex∣tant for our daily use and imitation; all the estates, king∣domes, cities, and countries of the world are governed,
Lawes and Printing maintained, justice and discipline administred, youth bred in pietie, vertue, manners and learning at schooles and Vniversities, and that which is both most and best, all the Churches of God from the beginning established, and alwaies unto this day edified, yea and will be to the end of the world, not∣withstanding all and whatsoever to the contrary is ei∣ther intented, or can be prosecuted. But if any should demand how these prerogatives of writing doe belong to Expedition, and exact teach∣ing to write? I answer, by reasoning thus, Vnder the generall of every thing, all the specials thereof are included. But Expedition and exactnesse of teaching to write, are specials of writing. Therefore Expedition and exactnesse of teaching to write, are included under the generall of writing. The proposition hath alwaies beene a principle in reason, and therefore is a thing most evident. The assumption may be cleared, first thus. 1 If the knowledge, use and benefit of writing be excellent, rare, and pretious, then the teaching thereof must also be so. But the former is manifest, therefore the latter will follow by true consequence. Secondly thus: 2 Teaching to write, is usefull and commendable, therefore Expedition in teaching to write, must also be usefull and commendable. The antecedent is already showne, and the conse∣quent plainely followeth. And thirdly, 3 Expedition is very usefull and commendable, not onely in respect of the easinesse and readinesse of teach∣ing and learning by meanes thereof, But likewise, of the encouragement of the learners, and that both by sparing their time and labours; and consequently so much the lesse hindering their other affaires, by how much these rules of art and method here professed, be
more exact, easie, and ready then any heretofore either taught or published. And if any should alledge, that many have taught to write both before these rules were knowne, and doe also teach yet without the knowledge of them, both speedily and well enough. To whom also I answer at length, and by occasion therof doe insist in divers particulars, which although they may seeme also at the first view not to agree, well enough to the point in hand, yet they doe serve greatly for illustrati∣on thereof, and are rather a transition to further probation, then any wise a digression, which may be as easily proved, as that which is immediately proved, if need so required. How many soever doe try or essay to doe any rare thing, that their action of trying or essaying, doth not prove the speedy nor well-doing of the thing, (which if I doe not (in what I professe) I doe nothing) for it is one thing to doe, and another thing to doe speedily, and the third thing to doe well; betweene the first and second, or yet the third, there is many times no lesse difference, then betweene a Master and a Disciple; and all the difference be∣tweene what I professe, and that which others doe, is that I thus endeavour to adde two words to mine, of which they are negligent in procuring to theirs, and these are Speedily and well: To the which two words, if I should reduce all my profession, it would follow by good enough consequence, that that man is very uncapable, that cannot learne from one that is so careful to teach, those two words in sixe houres time; yet I have more fully expressed these two in twelve words, which doe containe the substance of all words that can bee either spoken or written for our good, all the letters of the Alphabet, and all the curious strokes of joyning, and that for the speed and ease of all learners; which therefore if they once can doe, they may write what other matter or words they please, of that hand which they so learne. But to returne to our point, the greatest approbation standeth in this that followeth, how many soever doe a thing as well as possibly they can, if
there be yet one that excelleth them all, then will not his doing be so much the more in request, by how many have tryed either before him, or in his dayes to doe it? Whereas if but one or a few try to doe a thing, (as it were) in pri∣vate, it will be so much the lesse respected, by how much it is lesse knowne, tryed or approved. We see when a strong man (to try his strength) doth throw a double canon bullet alone, and casteth it further at the last, then at the first, doth over match no man, but himselfe, and not himselfe neither, because the difference doth consist in the circumstance of time, and not of person, in that he casteth it further at one time then at another, by his further practise, and longer experiment, for he still re∣maineth the same man. But to draw this point to some further length, if many have tryed their strength and skill before him, yea, and the furthest marke set up by any who have had the vantguard formerly, whether he or any of all the rest, shall yet be o∣ver reached by some other unexpected, then is his strength and skill discovered, that tryed last, and so much the more both respected and manifested, by how much hee over∣reached all that have tryed since the first. Moreover, if that wherein any doth excell many, and yet not all, be thus regarded, and that either for some dif∣ference of ability, and dexterity in the doing, or in regard of the time or place of the action, for possibly either some one or other elsewhere could have matched what was done there at that time, or else some living in the same place at another time. Then what greater respect shall be had to any profitable or vertuous worke that any one sould both begin and accomplish alone, which none be∣fore him in any age or nation ever so much as imagined? Herein doth singularity most consist, if by any it might be as lawfully affected, as it is needful by all to be rejected. I could give many instances, and of divers sorts, shew∣ing how some famous and rare men in all ages have beene excellent in many things above all others in the age wher∣in they have lived; some in some things, and others in
other things, yea, and some also in some things, which none either before or after them have done, (which is correspondent to what was spoken last) but because I af∣fect brevity, howsoever I be driven against my inclination and disposition, to the other extremitie, (even as well to be on my guard for all opposers, and to give every one his due, as to satisfie all learners, and to give each one his part;) I will make choise therefore to speake of those things which have beene in these dayes, because they are most in remembrance, or best knowne to many yet living, most pregnant to our present purpose, most forcible to prove the possibility of what is intended, and both most probable and credible to all of this age, since they have all come to passe therein. Many godly, wise, learned, and valiant men, both En∣glish and Scottish, hath Britaine brought forth, even in the same age wherein we live, who have excelled many that have beene before them in many ages, whose names were tedious to expresse, and their workes a thousand fold more tedious to declare in any competent measure; but both their matchlesse fame (in those things wherein they surmatched others) and their magnificke workes beare witnesse of their persons, who now rest from their la∣bours. I would gladly begin here at the highest degree, and expresse both some particular matter and cause of true and well deserved praise due unto that state, but especially to a happy and late Possessor thereof, were it not that I am commanded by modesty to cease, therefore onely thus much. If there were any universall Chronicles royall, the most renowned memory of King James for his matchlesse wise∣dome and learning, might not onely be recorded in great Capitall and text lines, with letters both of pure gold, and perfect silver, but likewise set with rich Diamonds and Pearle, and flourished in most curious manner, with all colours of inke, before all Kings since the dayes of good King Iosias; but such a one as I, neither being able in any
measure to expresse, nor yet any booke of this kinde wor∣thy to comprehend what commendation hee as Gods in∣strument (in using of his gifts) deserved, I think it most ex∣pedient to desist, and goe to others of inferiour degree. Yet onely these few I will name, with their rare and commendable acts so briefly, as the sufficiencie of the mat∣ter, and equitie of the cause doe require, and as there may be any impression left to the Reader or Hearer hereof, whereby, if they please, to enquire further of those things, which were done by these worthy Instruments, whom it pleased God to raise up for his owne glory, and the good of his Church. Onely these five I will name, the first is Master William Perkins, because hee was one of the first in this age, that tooke extraordinary paines in writing many excellent and learned Bookes, both for the benefit and ease of all that either wrote or taught since, or yet learned for their owne us. And to the intent hee might so much the better per∣forme what he had resolved in this matter, hee did mode∣rate both his dyet and sleepe according to the shortnesse of his time, and necessitie of his calling: for he not onely (almost every day of his pilgrimage in this life, after he was any wise enlightned and enabled) was marvellous diligent and temperate, but likewise in the night time he had a de∣vice tyed about his necke, which after hee had slept foure houres time, gave him a checke, by meanes whereof hee wakened, that (after he had stroken fire) he might either reade, write, pray, or meditate two or three houres, many times before any of the house (whithersoever hee sojour∣ned) went to their businesses. The second is Master Henry Ainsworth, who both wrote very much, and learnedly, and lived very modestly: yea and had no more for a long time, but eight pence a weeke. The third is Master George Buchanan; who had the ho∣nour to be Tutor to our late Soveraigne Lord King Iames of famous memory; although many in divers nations both before him, and in his dayes, have tryed to translate the Psalmes of David in latine verse, yet never any of their translations were thought comparable to Buchanans
Psalmes. And by reason thereof, and of some other rare workes, and that hee was so happy an instrument of the breeding of such a worthy Monarch, whom all the world admired for his wisedome and learning; his fame is very great among all the godly learned in Europe, and so much the greater, both because he was a great traveller, and that his bookes are dispersed in all nations. The fourth is Master Iames Creighton, who being a Ba∣ron in Scotland, choosed rather to travell in forraigne na∣tions, and follow his learning, then to stay at home and enjoy his Patrimony. Concerning whom, though I bee somewhat large, I hope it shall not seeme tedious; howso∣ever many have taken great paines both to attaine lear∣ning, and to invent the art of memory (to be a helpe ther∣unto yet this yong Noble man was matchlesse in both, and that not onely in his youth-hood at home, but likewise in all his travels abroad, yea & scarcely doth any history make mention of any the like before him: and besides, which is no lesse worthy consideration, it is reported (by men of great worth and credit, who are yet alive, and knew his education) that he was never taught, at least after the or∣dinary manner in studying by booke; onely he sometimes heard what was taught to others, and seldome either read or studied, bu rather (besides the appointed times of re∣creation) he had liberty procured of those who hearing of his fame, came both farre and neare to visit and try whe∣ther or not such things were, according to the report, when in the meane time all the rest of his condisciples were kept in at their studies, and that both when he was at Schooles and Vniversities. After he had thus past his course, and came to be made Master of Arts, (as they are called there) scarcely any could be found to dispute against his Theses in publike. Least they should incurre any disgrace before such a learned au∣ditory, and that from such a young Sholler, for his fame being so spread throughout all the land, there was a greater assembly of the learned in the Vniversitie of S. Andrewes at that time, then was either many yers before, or yt
since, in the time of any laureation. Having past his degree, and enting in his travels, and upon the manifold experiences which he had of his owne ability at home, whither soever he came, and heard of any publike declamation or disputation, there, or any where, he alwaies addvessed himselfe thither against the time ap∣pointed, if either distance of place, or other urgent occasi∣ons did not hinder him. And amongst many other places wherein he purchast great commendation, he being once at Constantinople, (as some doe thinke, and others doe al∣ledge it was at Padua, but wheresoever it was, the action is most certaine, because it was his ordinatie practise any where,) and there being a very great assembly of the most learned of that part of the world, and a most pregnant and rare man having declamed an excellent Oration, and ob∣tained greater applause then many others of a long time; Master Creighton (being very attentive before his face all the while, and unknowne almost to any) asked licence, although a stranger, to speake a few words against him who had last spokē, (alledging that that assembly being like a proclaimed Fayre, to which all strangers were invited, and none exempted, but each one free both to buy such wares as they should need, and to sell such as they have to spare;) which being granted, he began thus: This is a very learned man, saith hee, but he hath his learning, as many have their riches, even by reaping the fruits of other mens labours. If this hath beene his practise heretofore, I know not, but one thing I know well, all that he hath spoken now, is that which I was minded to speake, by what meanes he hath got the copie thereof, I am not yet certain, but to be short, I will prove that it is mine, and not his, be∣fore all this honourable Auditorie, thus: first, I will repeat all and whatsoever he hath spoken, verbatim: secondly, shew him where he failed in such things: thirdly, shew how he and all others may prevent the like errour henceforth: and lastly, resume all in a few heads, and raise some observations thereupon. Which hee did at great length according to the method laid downe, and was both
heard with farre greater attention then the first speaker, and received ten times greater applause then he did. The other speaker being astonied and silenced all this time, and yet keeping his pulpit, which was so much the more griefe unto him, by how much he was the more con∣spicuous to the eyes of all, his case so suddenly altering, yea and turning quite contrary to what it was an houre or two before; for the affront or defeat which hee received then, did countervaile all his applause immediately before. At length, Master Creighton having finished what hee was to speake, and all the people earnestly looking what issue would come of all these proceedings, and hee percei∣ving the countenance of the other speaker all the while to be a little altered, desired him to take courage againe, for he would tell him such good newes, as might be a meanes both to revive his spirit, and restore him to his former hopes of preferment, yea and also to the favour of all those that might preferre him, which hee did after this manner. He not onely confessed publikely, that the speaker was a very learned man, and worthy of such promotion as was expected at that time, (which notwithstanding him∣selfe might have had, and farre greater too, (both there & in many other places) if he had either loved preferment for learning, better then learning it selfe, or yet the favour of great men, who both loved him so dearely, and respe∣cted him so greatly, that almost they made him their equall wheresoever he went. But likewise he acknowledged that all which was spo∣ken, was the speakers owne worke, and no part thereof his, more then the observations which he in publike made so abruptly by occasion thereof: for it pleased God to give him such an excellent gift of memory to adorne his lear∣ning, that he could hardly forget any thing whatsoever he either read, saw, or heard; and withall he protested, that what he did, was not to doe harme to any man, nor yet to extenuate or undervalue any mans gifts, of what measure soever, but rather to encourage, and doe good to all, by of∣fering unto them the benefit of what he received, and that
he might declare what was spoken amisse: which hee did so much the rather, because the same was so farre from be∣ing perceived by any of the most pregnant in all that great assembly, that some did approve by their applause, and o∣thers by their silence, even that, as well as any thing that was spoken: for he considered that things so publikely ut∣tered, ought either to be publikely approved, by silence, be∣ing found good, or (after licence given) to bee publikely reproved by contradicting, if they be otherwise; to the in∣tent that God might be glorified in whatsoever gifts he be∣stoweth upon men, and all his people truely informed by the use thereof in all things, and so none to depart in doubt of any thing delivered. Most of his rare workes with the times, places, causes, and occasions thereof, are largely comprehended in the Duke of Manto his records, with whom he spent most of his dayes, and in a booke dedicated to himselfe by one Ma∣nutius a learned Italian, who having either conversed with him in his travels, or being an eye witnesse to many of his proceedings, giveth him greater commendation then hath beene given to any, since the dayes of the Apostles, who had the extraordinary gifts of the spirit. The fift and last is John Naper, who was father to my Lord of Merchiston that now is: he was reported to bee one of the most painefull and learned Divines that hath beene of any Noble man these many yeeres; and besides many other his rare workes, wherein he was most labori∣ous (even when he was grievously diseased with the Gout for divers yeeres together, which is so much the greater commendation to him, by how much it might have beene an excuse to others) he was one of the first and chiefest in our dayes that tooke excessive paines day and night, to bring the booke of the Revelaton to be so well understood and taught, as God be praised it is at this day: (for this I know, being his neighbour a long time at Edenborough, (though I had neither the happinesse to bee acquainted with him, nor to be capable of his worth) his candle went never out (I thinke) so long as his breath was in,) for he
considering the title thereof to be the Rvelation of Iesus Christ, and finding a blessing pronounced to all those that reade, heare, and practise the same, did spend most of his daies in labouring to discover the mysterie of that most ex∣cellent and profound Prophecie, that it might be under∣stood in some measure by all unto whom it was sent, and so much the rather, that as the Holy Spirit is the first love-token or earnest of our salvation, so the Revelation is the last love-token, that our Saviour hath sent to his Church, till he himselfe returne. By reason whereof, how many soever hath written, since Merchiston did write, and it may bee hath seene farther then he, which he himselfe would also have done, if he had lived longer as well as they, (and which doth appeare in that his owne last edition, so farre excelleth the first) yet he being such a wise, learned, and excellent guide, in going before, and pathing (or at least greatly helping to path) the way (as it were in a morning, throw great heapes of snow) unto all that have walked since, by his so exquisite labours, even his paraphrases of this kinde, is more worthy (I say) of commendation in that respect at least, then any who have yet succeeded him, for they have had all his endea∣vours to be a light (under God) to them, but he had none of theirs to helpe him. And therefore as his name was Na-peir, both after the Scottish pronuntiation and estima∣tion, so it may be justly called No-peere, according to the English: It is the fame which hee hath left, that maketh his name to be great, for he is yet called there, as (I thinke) he may be to the worlds end, either here, or any where, Matchlesse MERCHISTON Mathematitian. If all the names should bee inserted here, of all the fa∣mous and valiant men (such as King Robert Bruce, and Sir William Wallace) with all their matchlesse acts, and all the remarkable deeds of others in other ages, who have beene greatly renowned in that most renowned kingdome of Scotland, (which I have the honour to call the land of my nativitie) and not those few examples in this age, as well of that, as of this worthy kingdome wherein now I live,
chosen for all, to shew that any man is so much the better, yea, and the more to be hoped and expected of what hee can doe, in that he hath beene borne or bred there, but far more both, doubtlesse it might fill as great a volume as the Romane History. And if it be thus unto such there, it will follow also in time, to be so unto the like here, and that because they are both of Britaine, and so both not onely of one continent, and of one name, but likewise are now both under one head, and of one Religion, yea and hath both one kinde of languag, and one forme of writing, and that which crowneth all, they do all strive to love one another, as they doe themselves. THVS, leaving the commendation of some par∣ticular persons, who have excelled all others in the things whereof they were excellent, I will speake somewhat of the honour of that renowned kingdome, which chiefly consists in the prerogatives or priviledges thereof, with thy leave and patience, diligent Reader, & without derogation to any other kingdome, which hath either greater honour or prerogatives, or better priviledges of other kindes, or yet is of greater worth of it selfe; after I have shewed some differences betweene that nation, people, and commodi∣ties thereof, and others who challenge a higher place un∣der the pretence of some greater respects: all which al∣though I doe, I hope no judicious man will finde that I digresse any wise from the point, who will but consider with me, that whatsoever things are in the way of any thing, have alwaies some relation to the end thereof, be∣cause they leade thereunto, and that some impements al∣so must be removed out of the way hereof, which doe greatly hinder the passage to the end, that the worke may the more easily proceed. For since the probability of the possibility of this taske is my part at this time, I must first use such lawfull ordinarie meanes, as I know will make way unto the performance thereof, and then those, which will fully accomplish the thing expected. And if it be needfull that the end where∣fore
we ayme at any thing be wished and laboured for, by all those who desire that thing, then doubtlesse to shew both the possibility of attaining, and probability or certain∣ty of attaining thereof, must also be needfull, and that not for the undertaker alone, but for all who would partake of the benefit as well as he, and especially those who are ei∣ther doubtfull or mistrustfull, and therefore slacke in using of the meanes, that they also being in some measure satisfi∣ed, as well as others, may with the more courage, intend, begin, proceed, and prosecute as well as others. But although the nature of many things, both spoken, and to be spoken here, doth not agree strictly to writing it selfe, yet if they be well considered largely, they doe serve greatly both to shew the possibility of so speedy teaching to write, and to make way to the probabilitie thereof, by shewing that there be some men of one king∣dome, that be farre more generous and compleately both bred, qualified or gifted, yea and can take greater paines to put all to a good use, then all those of another kingdome, who are most pregnant in any facultie of this kinde. To the intent it may appeare, that from those excellent preroga∣tives, which may justly be attributed to the whole king∣dome in generall, whereof I am to speake, and especially to the head thereof as the fountaine, there may be some is∣sue of excellencie derived to every particular member of the same, above those who cannot claime unto the like, as both divine and other histories doe specifie, what great pri∣viledge it was to be a Romane. And likewise, it is needfull that those prerogatives and priviledg be here expressed for another speciall respect, yet tending to make way to the same end and purpose, e∣ven for preventing or removing a prejudicate opinion which some of the vulgar sort, have against the famous kingdome of Scotland, and that without any ground or reason, insomuch as though one like Salomon should come forth thereof to this place, yet they were wont more often then now, thus to demand, Can any good thing come out of Scotland? doth it afford this or that? doe such and
such things grow there? doe any such learned men, or faire writers live there, as there be here? and many the like idle questions, which be rather moved for derision, then any wise to require resolution. 1 But all such kinde of persons were fully answered, and confuted, both in those, and in all other such things: for not onely it pleased God, that one like Salomon came out thereof indeed, & removed all such questions, as the bright sunne doth expell the misty clouds, and did put to silence all such persons (at least their impudncie and frequncie in those things) and that both by shewing them the con∣trary of what they pretnded, or would have had, and ma∣king such a combination betweene them, and those of whom they spake, that the like was never formerly in Bri∣taine: so that many of both nations, who were diversly af∣fected before, have respected others as their owne most affectioned and deare brethren (both at home and abroad) afterwards, and for the most part, ever since? But another also hath come forth thereof, God blesse him, (like Josias) who can both represse all such frivolous questions, and re∣dresse all those who will offer to propound them any more. 2 Abundance and varietie of all commodities doe both come out of Scotland daily hither, by sea and land, and goe every where abroad, (as have alwaies in all ages) which doe manifest the plentifull increase thereof. If some parts of that land may be called barren, it is but in respect of o∣ther parts; even as the most fruitfull kingdome cannot be all alike fruitfull; for there was a hill country in the land of Canaan it selfe, for bestiall, as well as valley or dale∣ground for corn; yea and doubtlesse there be some speciall parts also of it, as good as the best parts of other king∣domes, the value of the commodities which those parts doe afford, being accounted according to the valuation of the places, where they come to be in greatest request, like as other kingdomes doe with the commodities which they yeeld. 3. The worthy people of that ancient kingdome, doe
live with such plenty of all sorts of things at home amongst themselves, as they need not yeeld nor give place, to any people or nation for any thing, more then they need to doe unto them: and therefore although mutuall traffique or exchange of commodities be no disparagement (I hope) but rather a great credit, as well as an advancement to any people of whatsoever kingdome: yet they could as well (at least) subsist without the same, (if there were cause, as I hope there shall never be) yea and live both as conten∣tedly and modestly with their owne, as any people in the world. If at any time, especially in the yeeres of famine, when it pleaseth God most justly to afflict them, as he doth their neighbour countries, (either then, or at other times) they be forced to buy such things as they need, from other nati∣ons, as Gods people of old did of Egypt, they pay them as well for what they receive, as other nations doe when they buy such things (as they need) of them, upon the like occa∣sions, either of necessitie or extremitie. And if none be a∣ble to prove any thing to the contrary of those things, then why doe not all acknowledge them to be true? Whereby (in the meane time as it hath beene alwaies) it is most evident (although there were no more to be said) that that kingdome is a most compleate kingdome, and both as plentifull and able to serve the owne turne, as any other kingdome is to serve it selfe: And therefore no que∣stion ought to be made (by any whosoever) neither of the plentie nor abilitie thereof, more then of any other king∣dome, neither in sport to maintaine table discourse, nor yet in earnest purpose for curiositie, at other times or occasions. Those who doe enjoy a better land, are bound to be so much the more thankfull to him, who is the true owner of the whole earth, and all that therein is, to dispose unto what people soever he will; which dutie if they doe not carefully discharge, they will be so much the more inexcu∣sable in the day of retribution, when they are called to ac∣count for violent possession thereof: and wee are taught,
taught, both by his word and daily experience, as wll as by histories, how often the Monarchies and Kingdomes of the world are translated from one people unto another, and all through ingratitude and impenitencie. And whereas it may be thought, that some other king∣domes being more fruitfull, are therefore more able to sup∣ply the necessities of that kingdome, then it is to helpe them; yet if the varietie, extent, and worth of all things which it sendeth yeerely to other kingdomes, above what any king some sendeth it, be well weighed, esteemed, and considered, none of them can surmatch it, yea scarcely compare with it in any degree, howsoever many doe sur∣passe the greater part of it. But how this defect thereof, in respect of other kingdomes, and yet the compleatnesse or equalitie of it with the best of them, can agree in the gene∣rall; since onely, but some parts thereof, can match the best parts of them, (and yet neverthelesse hath as great plenty in the generall, both to serve it selfe within, and to furnish others without, as any of them) those two effects doe pro∣ceed of these two causes (or suppliments two manner of waies) the one principall, and the other secondarie. 1 The first or principall, doth proceed of the blessing of God, which in the midst of outward povertie, maketh riches to increase, as the land of Canaan, though of it selfe farre inferiour to other lands, both in quantitie and fertili∣ty, yet so long as his people had their residence there, it did flow with milke and hney, and sustained at one time, eighteene hundred thousand fighting men, both besides the tribe of Levi, and what it spared also to send abroad to other nations; yea and all the mightie Kings and Iudges thereof in more sumptuous manner, many times, then any Monarches ever were before, or after them. 2 The second, of the vertuous industrie of the people of that kingdome, which may bee well compared with the industrie of the most excellent people of whatsoever king∣dome (although they have both greater matter whereof, and a better subject whereon to worke.) The first world had almost all things without labour, which fertile king∣domes
doe yet imitate, that they may have the more time to vice, as they had: but the commendable people of the famous kingdome of Scotland, doe surpasse all fertile king∣domes in labour and industrie, both early and late, yea and sweating of all the body, as well as the forehead, according to the ordinance of God, pronounced upon the disobedi∣ence of our first Parents. In citie labour, or artificer worke, yea or cosening by trade, they delight not to be so expert, as some people of o∣ther kingdomes are, neither to maintaine unnecessarie trades, or such as any wise tend, or be more inclinable to vice then vertue, nor to sell slight or counterfeit wares, under colour of good and upright; nor yet are they any wise so bold either to praise their owne wares (at home nor abroad) nor to invite (farre lesse take hold of) custo∣mers, as they passe the streets upon other businesses, to come in, and buy their wares: but as for the most part, they are every way both more conscionable and modest, so many of them likewise have all needfull things, both as cu∣rious, and farre more substantious to sell, unto such onely as doe offer to buy, then any others elsewhere. Their obedience to the true God and Christ whom hee hath sent, and to their superiours, with their commendable industrie, and conscionable carriage; yea and their dis∣creet spending on food and apparrell, according to their degree (with other respects which may be gathered from other particulars following) are the causes, doubtlesse, that it hath pleased God to keepe that worthy native people together, as the true of spring of the first planters of that land, though alwaies sending multitudes upon all occasi∣ons to helpe other nations, even unto this day, when al∣most all the world hath turned upside downe. So the matchlesse industrie, srugalitie, care, and labour of that most vertuous people, is the secondarie cause of their equalitie of maintenance with the people of other kingdomes (both to spend and send) or the suppliment of any defect of fruitfulnesse in that kingdome. Which consists rather in carefull, diligent, and timely
manuring the ground, (both before and after the sowing of the seed) attending their bestiall, and in making all kinde of cloth, as well linnen as woollen; which according to the commenable practise both of Bathsheba, the mo∣ther of King Salomon, Dorcas, and other both Noble and religious women, is the laudable exercise also of all the ho∣nourable and grave womn, throughout the most part of that kingdome, as well Citie as Country, and that to serve their owne families, to give unto those that stand in ned, and either to sell at home, or send abroad in exchange for othr wares. But they doe not esteem vertue to consist in citie industrie, yea or scarcely any thing done with the needle, worthy of the name of worke, except onely the making of needfull and comely apparrell; for howsoever it be thought by others elsewhere, to bee vertuous, yet by them, it is either frivolous or idiculous, or for the most part idle or vicious, because it maintaineth both: yea and the women there, are so grave, shamefast, and modest, yea and so farre from following new fashions, either by changing with the winde, commonly every weeke, or with the Moone surely every moneth, that they keepe the very sur-name they have of their father, as well as their christen-name, even from their birth to their death, accor∣ding to the custome observed, for the most part, in other nations. Thus it is apparent by their practise, that these being the three chiefe, and most commendable points of civill vertue, are therefore to bee embraced, and all others that are either repugnant, or not agreeable to any of these, nei∣ther are subordinate to serve or maintaine all, or any of them, nor yet the actors or instruments thereof in any re∣spect (spiritually nor civilly) can hardly come within the compasse of laudable vertue; but rather are, (as they al∣waies have beene) procuring causes to draw downe Gods inevitable judgements upon Kingdomes, Nations, Coun∣tries and Cities. All vertuous Citizens that doe live in a lawfull calling, whither they procure much or little by their honest
industrie, are hereby commended, in that they are under these three sorts comprehended; and in a most specall manner those that are most eminent, by their commenda∣ble workes, as well for the common wealth, as their owne particular or private respects, such as either Master Sutton, or Master Middleton at London, or Master Heriot at E∣denburgh. And againe, as it is said of a strong man, that he can live any where, according to that Proverbe, Omne solum forti patria; so it may be justly said of Scottish men, that they can live in any part of the world (whither it be inhabited or not) for as they are both most curious and desirous to travell in all nations for attaining of languages, manners, and for supplying of whatsoever defects in their breeding at home, that they may be complete men, as the land of their nativity, is a complete land; so they are most wel∣come of any people, I thinke in the world, wheresoever they travel or resort, for not only the nobler or more gentle sort are meete for any rare enterprise of great worth: But likewise the inferiours are bred either to some Art or profession at home before they come forth, or to put their hand to any kinde of ordinary worke, & to comport with whatsoever kinde of entertainement or lodging, yea and to beare with the dispositions of any kinde of people, according to reason and discretion: whereas those that come short either in all those or most of them, and yet will travell, would doe better to stay at home, and either keepe the Tongs at the fire side, or looke to the Geese about the dores. By consideration of which premisses before and after specified, it may be easily observed, that a plantation of Scottish men in any fertile kingdome, doth farre excell so many in number as doe come from any other kingdome unto that soyle; as we may easily perceive what great po∣licy, labour and industrie, they of the Scottish nation have made in the north, yea or worst parts of the kingdome of Ireland, both above the natives, & others of the Southern, best, and most choisest places of the whole land: if withall
wee will carefully account, or duely respect the great dif∣ference or inequality of the places. And by consequence hereof, it may be observed, at least supposed, that if a num∣ber were indifferently chosen, in Scotland, brought forth thence, and placed in any kingdome more fertile▪ then it, and as many country men of that kingdome, sent thither in their places, surely it might be well expected, that the one would make such a vertuous and honest shift to la∣bour the ground, and live without any supply at all (but Gods alsufficient providence) whereas it might be suspe∣cted, that the other would starve and die, if they were not both better and more speedily supplied, then all the indu∣strie they could use, whereby to live. And to come to an easier and nearer tryall, we both see here, and it is knowne every where, when any generous, or laborious Scottish man is equally matched to worke, toyle, eate, drinke, sleepe, travell, yea or fight with any such as himselfe (by appearance) of any othrland, it is ten to one, if he hold not out, and prevaile, when the other shall die or give over; which as it is a speciall cause that Scottish men are generally and universally as well accep∣ted and priviledged, as almost the natives of any nation, or at least farre better, then so many such others of whatsoe∣ver other nation: so also in that they are so well beloved every where, is a speciall encouragement for them to tra∣vell, as some of them alwaies doe, since wheresoever they so journe, they are (for the most part) as duely respected, yea, and upon as reasonable termes, as they are in farre di∣stant parts from their habitatin, friends, and acquaintance in their owne land. The ancient Roman priviledge, though it went for cur∣rent in the behalfe of all Romans, throughout all nations, could never in the best time thereof, match this peculiar passage and generall acceptation of Scottish men: for be∣like, the Romans did rather claime it as a kinde of homage or obedience due unto them, as being either citizens of Rome, or subjects to the Emperour their head, who had al∣most subdued all nations, then as a thing any wise belong∣ing
to them, through their own desert, or good behaviour: for we see that what priviledge, libertie, or toleration soe∣ver is taken by compulsion, is not comparable to that which commeth freely by deserved love, or is given by tender affection. I will choose two instances, which are most pregnant to our intended purpose, in stead of many others of other kindes, which might also be alledged, were it not for pro∣lixitie, which will both give farther light to this point, and shew that none hath any just cause to demand, if there bee any learned men, or yet faire writers in Scotland. 1 The first is, whosoever shall examine the practise of learned Scottish men, at home, and compare the same with such others abroad, in any forraine nation, or yet thir practise abroad, wheresoever they so journe, and doe teach either old or young, and compare the same with those of that profession, who be natives in those places, and then they shall see, that if the fruits of their labours doe not surmount all that the natives are able to doe, of that profes∣sion in that land, they shall equally match them at least, and besides give both better attendance, and take greater paines for discharge of whatsoever duty they undertake to performe, then they, doe what they can. 2 And the next is, Scotland is so farre from being inferi∣our to any other kingdome in any thing needfull to the common wealth thereof, that it is rather superiour to all kingdomes and nations; for it hath such a neare relation to every nation under the sunne, that almost there is no com∣mendable art nor profession any where, but either it, or the like is taught, professed, and practised in Scotland, either in Schooles or Vniversities; or else some Scottish man or other, can compasse the way, or finde out the meanes whereby to attaine both to the knowledge and practise of it; howsoever (by the way) I have heard it often deman∣ded (among other questions) whether or no, there be any Vniversities there? but I have answered, twise so many as be here: although it were as rare, or excellent an Arte, as the Phoenix is a bird, (that cannot live so farre north)
yet Scotland it selfe is both as rare, and farre more excel∣lent, yea and hath many hundreth yeeres longer subsisted (God be praised) than ever any Phoenix lived: & as in hand∣ling another point by and by shall be shewed, that in se∣verall respects, a more excellent and magnifique king∣dome was never. But in the meane time to end this point, Scotland is so farre from yeelding to any other kingdome in any thing, that it will not so much as yeeld, in so meane a thing as Writing, (which if I be well remembred, is reckoned in the last place, among such questions as the common peo∣ple doe usually propound upon all occasions) saving that through modesty, and entertaining of love, it will rather give place to many kingdomes, than take it from any kingdome at all. If any of any kingdome will demand any such question any more, though none of all the men of Scotland would daine himselfe to answere it, because it (being so frivolous) merits no answer, but rather a rebuke, (as I have given to many of the baser sort, who have both murmured, and ta∣ken exception of my Nation, yea and uttered more, then either I will expresse, or yet (I thinke) they would avow,) if they should be called to give a reason or warrant. Surely the most rare and curious writs and workes of one woman, Esther English by name, which are extant both in his Majesties Librarie at Saint Iameses, and in the Vniversitie of Oxford, and in many other places else∣where, may be patternes and examples, as well for practice as teaching, both to all the men and women, professors and others▪ that either are or have beene in Europe these many yeeres; and yet notwithstanding she would never offer to contend with me in the practise, let be in the art, but not onely gave place very freely, after some further no∣tice, than she had received at the first, especially of a No∣ble mans sonne of nine yeeres old, whom I had taught to write a number of hands in most excellent manner, who was therefore brought in before the King, as shall be shewed hereafter: but likewise she ever behaved her selfe
very discreetly to me, as I alwaies endeavoured both to her, and all others in all things according to my power. And besides her, there bee many excellent Writers in that kingdome, such as these (which I doe specifie rather after their age, than either according to their degree or gifts) Master Alexander Paterson, John Matheson, Charles Geddy, John Peter, Iames Clarke, and Hew Wallce; some whereof are very exquisite also in many other hands than be used in Britaine: so that in the famous kingdome of Scotland, whosoever should be so curious as to search, from men indued with gifts of the highest degree, even unto the lowest, they would both finde, that it is well enough sto∣red with all sorts of learned and excellent men, who pro∣fesse all needfull and commendable Arts, Sciences, and pro∣fessions; and that some thereof are as exquisite, in what they professe, as any of that profession in any other king∣dome or nation. And therfore the premisses being well considered, I hope no exception shall be any more taken, either of me, or any other of whatsoever degree, in that we have been borne or bred in that kingdome; for if both I and every one should pretermit or passe by such assertions, or rather aspertions a∣gainst the renowne of so worthy and famous a kingdome, which by the right of birth, as wel as other respects, we are bound to defend, then it would quickly follow that each one would get way, and so consequently in time it might reach very high. And besides, it is rather a Iewish than Christian opinion, to extenuate the commendation of any worthy nation; for the Iewes undervalued the worthy and honourable Citie of Nazaret, in that they made question if any good thing could come forth thereof, in respect of the other mightie Cities of Iudea, wherein belike they more gloried, then glorified God for enjoying of them. Then to conclude this point, no prejudicate opinion be∣ing any more conceived, no more exception will be any more taken by any, to extenuate whatsoever any of hat kingdome hath, which another of another kingdome hath not; and so by this meanes and occasion, not onely the way
being rid of all such impediments, to me in this mean par∣ticular, it may be the more patent to others in a greater matter: but likewise it being proved by the matchlesse prerogatives of that ancient kingdome, that it is in many respects, of incomparable fame, (of which preroga∣tives so great a number of valorous Kings and their royall acts, recorded in so many famous histories, may well bee reckoned in the first place, as shall be done God willing, by and by, and that our dread Soveraigne, the Kings most excellent Majestie, their lineall successor to raigne over that most ancient kingdome, is the most renowned, and famous King in the world. So, if all these weightie respects bee well weighed, and duely considered, it will follow better thus, then by any other pretended consequence, that there is rather so much the more to be expected of all Scottish men, even because they are Scottish men, yea and that they are so much the more also to be respected, because they have that due and respective honour, title, and prerogative, then if they were of any other kingdome or nation whatsoever; and that by vertue f the honour and excellencie derived from the head to all the body, and so to every member thereof: ther∣fore this is one of the chiefe causes, why so many generous Scottish men in their travels almost any where, save in England, neither having lands appropriated unto them, whereby to distinguish themselves from others, of inferi∣our qualitie, although perchance discended of a worthy and ancient house, nor yet any title conferred on them, but onely the generall, that they bee Scottish men, are prefer∣red (both by getting place and preferment) to many o∣thers of other nations, who either have lands or other ti∣tles, (besides the denomination of their country) yea, and sometimes both; which is a great cause & encouragement for Scottish men to travell, as they doe farre more then o∣thers. But this one thing yet remaineth to be declared, before we proceed to other matter; it is needfull also for the bet∣ter understanding, and so in some measure, making up a
compleat sense) both of what hath beene said, and is to be spoken to the commendation of the kingdome of Scotland, even to shew in what respects, it can but compare with the kingdome of England, let be with other kingdomes, although these so joyne together, as that they both make but one continent: yea and doe almost lye under one climat and Horizon; which one example shall suffice to shew how Scotland may compare with other king∣domes, esteeming England in this comparative respect, and many others of other nature, to be as worthy a kingdome (for the quantity) as any in the world. Therefore I will use my best endeavours, to make a short dscription of both these kingdomes, that the chiefe cause may both be so much the better, and easier perceived: for apparently they will be rather found to appeare in the different use of them, ac∣cording to the severall dispositions, opinions, or practises of the inhabitants of either, then in any correspondencie or equalitie betweene them other wise: which comparison is very worthy observation, especially by those who would either learn to be good husbands any where, or yet would conferre or examine their owne private skill, opinion, or practise, with the ancient, publike, and approved skill, opinion, and practise of those, who have beene both better and longer exercised, in all the severall sorts and degrees of good husbandry. The kingdome of England is a most excellent, pleasant, and fruitfull land, fairely planted, rarely built, and both well inriched and garnished with all sorts of commodi∣ties, and objects of pleasure, almost like unto France, which is (thought to be) the garden of the world. It pleaseth God, that England yeeldeth abundance of increase, in all things needfull for this mortall life, but espe∣cially those things most intended (or best liked) by the in∣habitants thereof, which are indeed (for the most part) as civill, modest, and loving a people, both among themselves, and almost to all strangers (at home & abroad) yea and as faithfull, true, and obedient subjects to our and their dread Soveraigne, as either wee, or any other his Majesties Sub∣jects,
or yet the subjects of any other King, ever were, or can be to any King, Monarch, or Emperour in all the world. This fertile kingdome of England, bringeth forth as great plenty of all sorts of graine, and of all kinde of fruits and hearbs, with milke and honey, and all variety and di∣versitie of other things▪ both for profit and pleasure, that mans heart can desire, for the maintenance and refresh∣ment of naturall life, I thinke as any kingdome whatsoe∣ver of the bignesse thereof, and so farre as it is sowne and laboured: for the inhabitants of England, almost evr since the dayes of Engist, of whom both the land and they doe take the name, have thought it farre more easie, and no lsse profitable, to reserve many of the best, and most fruit∣full places of the land, rather for the entertainment of all sorts of bestiall, which they delight more and more yet to have multiplied, than for the bearing or increasing of Wheate, Barlie, Pease, or Beanes; and therefore the com∣mon people belike, having greater plenty of all kinde of fleshes, than of all sorts of bread, doe choose or take occa∣sion to attribute the generall name meate, to flesh, rather than to bread, or any other kinde of victuals: whether they doe it, because they have it most, or love it best, or both, is somewhat questionable, but (notwithstanding all their industry and plenty) one thing is without all question, it remaineth as deare as other things: which is somewhat mitigated, both in their higher valuation of money, and greater plenty thereof, than Scotland hath at this time, be∣cause the Court lyeth there. I need not to be very prolixe in this description, because I know wherein I am either briefe or deficient, will be well supplied by the natives themselves upon all occasions, who know their own land better than I, or any other stranger, but now wee are all one. The kingdome of Scotland, beause it doth consist as much in hils, as valleyes, and therefore neither altogether so fruitfull as England, nor yet lyeth so hot towards the Sunne: It is the most healthfull or well ayred land to live
in, of any whatsoever, for it hath many high and great mon∣tains, faire and open fields, fresh and fierce running wates, both cleare and wholesome, with innumerable springs and brookes mingled throughout the whole land. And that I may be the more brief in describing thereof, if the native forme & fertilitie of a whole Kingdome may bee understood by the like properties of a Province in another kingdome: then the kingdome of Scotland is most like to the County of Kent of any part in England, & that in diverse respects, for though they differ far in quantity; yet not verie much in quality, because they aggree in these three. Some parts of the realme of Scotland doe yeeld great pro∣fite, but litle pleasure, safe only the pleasure which doth ac∣company profite, and these be all the valleys or valey ground (for the most part through the whole kingdome): which (in diverse respects) is esteemed either to be better of it selfe, or els far better laboured, than any of whatsoever kingdome. Other parts againe doe yeeld great pleasure but litle pro∣fite, and these bee, most of all the hills, banks, moores, and marrishes: for some of these be most convenient for haulking, & others for hunting, because there be greatest store of wild fowle, and venison in these places, And some parts are mixed both with all the meanes, and kinds of profite and objects of pleasure, and these bee, these which doe consist partly of hill and partly of dale ground, and are situated betweene the sides of all the rivers, springs, brooks or armes of the seas, and the tops of all the hills, or banks next adjcent or adjoying thereunto. These vertuous inhabitants of that worthy nation doe sow and labour all the parts of the land that may be conveni∣ently sowne and laboured▪ and do yeeld sufficiency of increase and leave all other parts for grasse, hay, woods and parks, so that by the blssig of GOD upon their labours, they have both plenty of bread and sufficiency of milk and honey, when as people of other countries (which are both hotter & bet∣ter, yea and might be easier laboured, for want of labouring) have scarcitie. This commeth to passe most usually in dry yeares (such as
both the two last, & agreat part of this) when the heat of the Sun burnes up even the best gasse of their fattst ground, which if it had beene applyed to corne, the height or length of the stalk or straw thereof would have better borne out a∣gainst the drought: so that if these people doe not learne of laborious Scottishmen, and put their hands better to work, they shall have neither bread nor milk to eate, far lesse flesh for all their grasse. But although I might insist largly here not only in descri∣bing that famous realme, and the due commendation of the worthie inhabitants thereof, and that for their excellent qua∣lities, (the like wherof so many, or at least in such measure no nation hath) & these be wisdome, fidelity, magnanimity, learning industry, frugality liberality, stability, dexterity, clerity, & pati¦ence: but likwise al the other matchles propties of that an∣cient kingdom, which by divine providence do for the most part flow from those, even as they doe from the fountaine of all goodnesse: but lest the illustration thereof should bee too large I refer the Reader to that Treatise called, The rare pre∣rogatives of Scotland, and doe only expresse them heere as I did the other: returne to our intended matter, and draw it to a conclusion. The prerogatives are these. 1. Scotland was never conquered. 2. It hath the greatest succession of Kings. 3. Scottishmen are the most excellent warriours. 4. Scotland is the best fortifier of other nations. 5. The Roman Emperours wall of defence from the Scotts. 6. Scottishmen are most compleetly bred and fatthest tra∣velled. 7. Scotland is an exact abridgment of the whole World. 8 Scotland can best serve it self without traffick 9. Scotland hath the strongest buildings, 10. and the rarest mo∣numents, both naturall and artificiall of any cuntrie. 11. and to crowne all the rest, Scotland made the most religious cove∣nant of any nation since the dayes of the gospell in the happy reigne of King Iames of blessed memory. Thus the the whole premisses partly expressed and partly to be understood being well pondered and considered, is not the antient kingdome of Scotland justly esteemed by many, and ought it not to bee generally accounted by all, the most renouned kingdome & so his Majesty the most famous King in all the World?
And will it not it follow by true consequence that a Scot-sman is so much the more able to prosecute whatsoever he underta∣keth, and therefore so much the more to be respected by how much he is more ingenuous than one of another nation? And why then, is there any more prejudicate opinion taken by any of me in my profession, but rather the possibility thereof more trusted, and the probability more expected, than if I were one of another nation? Now I with this litle bark being arrived at the haven unto which I intended, and after she and I have both beene driven so far out of the way beyond all expectation at the first, & in∣dured so great dangers not only of strong men of war: & con∣trary winds, but have past through so many difficulties both of rocks & quick sands, I proceed where I left. Howsoever this task of teaching to write in six hours may seem either to be hard or impossible, because it is rare or more than ordinary, yet it is effected by ordinary meanes through Gods assistance, unto whom all good things are possible, whe∣ther they be rare or frequent, and who giveth the successe to every thing he seeth good, not withstanding all & whatsoever impediments which any way do crosse his good purpose. And that it hath pleased him (who is the fficient cause of all goodnes) first to grant me the knowledg, next the practise, & thirdly the dexterity even to do good to others as well as my self by both: and fourthly to assist me in that profession hi∣therto, I prove at large in the first part of this work, or Art of Expedition, and that by the manifold effects both of what I (by his assistance) have formerly done, & now professe to do. Which if any do distrust, or think still impssible (although very probable) I hope if they wil but believe their own eys e∣ven by present ptactise, to give them such content, as hence∣forth they shall have no reason but to be silent. Although the time prescribed be only six hours, yet I doe neither exclude longer time, aswell for attaining further per∣fection of degries and celerity or speed, by much & often pra∣ctise after, as due theorie, true way or perfection of parts both of skill & speed by dexterity or rationall knowledg thereof. Neither yet do I prescribe so strict or short a time to accom∣plish this businesse as a precise task to all alike, because all are neither alike capable to learne, nor alike carefull to practise
nor yet to practise alike carefully nor constantly what they learne, yea even although they be men of age, learning & dis∣cretion, and have time & opportunity. And although all that do learne of one teacher may be alike equally taught, yet all cannot be alike speedily taught, because all cannot alike speedily learne; therefore some must have lon∣ger time than others, not in their teachers default, for hee can teach them as soone as others, but in their owne, who cannot learne so speedily as others, yea and although they could, yet if they be either not so carefull to practise, or that they doe pra∣ctise not so carefully and constantly as others, they will come so much shorter of their intent, and so will require so much longer time than others. Doe not both many of us see by dayly practise, and some of us feele by dolefull experience, that althogh painfull Preachers do never so equaly deliver Gods word to al their auditors, yet hey cannot teach them all alike spedily, because they cannot all learne alike speedily, neither though they could, are they all alike carefull to practise, and far lesse to doe it alike carefully, & constantly, & so in these things stands all the difference. Whereby it is evident that although writing bee never so equally taught to many, & well learned by some, yet it is only kept by those who practise it, and that both carefully and con∣stantly: at least halfe an houre in a day, till they have it per∣fectly. Therefore, as there is great difference aswell betweene tea∣chers and learners thereof as of other things, and sometimes defects on each side for want either of skill or care, if not of both, so there is great difference also betwene leners throgh the same defects: as the Sun shining on diverse objects ma∣keth diversity of effects. FINIS. SInce the first sheet heereof was printed, the Professor hath removed to a countrie house in Kemmington, which adioyneth to Newington-butts, (alitle above the signe of Iacobs Well, about a mile from London, and halfe a mile from Westminster) where hee usually attendeth everie morning till ten a clock and the rest of the day at the signe of the Spectacles over against the royall Exchange.
