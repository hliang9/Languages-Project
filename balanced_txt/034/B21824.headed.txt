An Act for the better Regulation of the Courts of Law in the Guild-Hall London. WHereas in the City of London there The Antiquity a great conveniency the Courts in Lond are Courts of Record holden of ancient Custome, that have cog∣nizance of all Actions and Causes, both in Law and Equity, so that no Citizen néed to go beyond the Walls of the said City for spéedy Iustice; which Courts have béen in all times sup∣plied with able Iudges, many of which, for their Worth and Learning, have béen advanced to places of great Honour and Dignity within these Realms;
And the KINGS and QUEENS of England, out of their great Care, and Princely Respect to the Citizens of London, have from time to time, by their respective Charters, granted and confirmed to the said City divers excellent Privileges and Immunities, which have not béen granted unto other Cities; amongst which it is not the least, That no Citizen should plead, or be compelled to plead, without the Walls of the said City, but in Charters of H. 1. d most other Kings d Queens of Eng∣d since the Con∣est, (whereof di∣s were granted in rliament,) No Ci∣en shall be com∣l'd to plead with∣t the Walls of the ty, &c. some few Cases excepted; and that Pleas should be holden in London for all Debts there made, ac∣cording to ancient Custome; and that none of the Fréedome of the City should be impleaded at the Ex∣chequer, or elsewhere, by Bill, but of those things which concern the KING or his Heirs: And whereas by several Acts of Common Council of this City, still in force, it is enacted, That no d by ancient Acts  Common Council, e Freemen are pro∣ited to sue one an∣her out of the City, en they may have eir Recovery in eir own Courts, up∣ great penalties, ich have been se∣ely inflicted upon e Offenders. he Freemen also e bound by Oath  their admission to e Freedome, not to e one another out  the City, &c. e contrary not∣thstanding much ed by Citizens of te tmes. Fréeman shall implead another Fréeman out of the City for any thing done within the City, where he may have his Recovery before the Mayor and the Sheriffs, upon the Peins therein limited: and whereas every Fréeman of this City stands obliged by his Oath, That the Franchises and Customes of the City he shall maintain, and that he shall im∣plead or sue no Fréeman out of the City, whilst he may have Right and Law within the same: and yet neverthelesse so it is, that of late years divers Citizens, of all qualities and degrées, (forgetting their said Oaths and the Privileges of the said City) have commenced, and do frequently commence, their Actions in other Courts without this City, or, be∣ing commenced within the same, do cause them to be thence removed by Writs, whereby the Courts of Iustice within the City of London are not onely slighted, but the said Citizens, aswell for petty
auses and small Debts as great, are troubled in ther Courts, to their very great Charge and Vexa∣ion: And forasmuch as the Clerks and Atturnies in the Irregular practices of the Clerks & Attur∣nies of the Sheriffs Courts in commen∣cing and removing Causes out of the City, and becoming Bail for their Clients. heriffs Courts of this City (contrary to several Orders of the Court of Aldermen, and Acts of this ourt of Common Council) do either advise their lients, Citizens of London, to commence their ions in other Courts, or else, whenas Causes are epared ready for Trial in the Sheriffs Courts of e said City, do cause them to be removed by Writs to such other Courts where they are likewise At∣rnies, and there their Clients be enforced to begin pon a new Charge, to the great Abuse of Citizens, d discouraging of the Fréemen of the said City to mmence their Suits in London, where they are ost properly determinable: For remedy hereof for the future, Be it Enacted, rdained and Established, by the Right Honourable e Lord Mayor, the right Worshipful the Alder∣en, his Brethren, and the Commons, in this ommon Council assembled, and by the Authority  the same, That no person, or persons, be at any None but Freemen shall be admitted Of∣ficers, Clerks and Atturnies in the Courts of the City▪ for the future. me hereafter admitted into any the Places or ffices of Secondaries of the Compters, Clerks  Atturnies in the Mayors Court, Clerk of the apers, Clerk-sitters, Atturnies in the Sheriffs ourts, of this City, Serjeants or Yeomen of the ompters, but that he or they do first take his or eir Fréedome of this City, according to former s and Orders of Common Council. And forasmuch as it is observed, that the Clerks d Atturnies of the Mayors and Sheriffs Courts of is City do bréed and bring up under them a mul∣ude of young Clerks, taking with them conside∣rable
summs of money, but for shorter terms the hath béen accustomed within this City; and that the Atturnies, Clerks and Officers, of an belonging to the Sheriffs of London, and the She¦riffs Courts, do often tender themselves to the De¦fendants arrested in their Courts, to become thei Bail, whereby to oblige them the more to follow thei Inconveniences of Atturnies & Officers being Bail for their Clients. Advice in consenting to the Removal of their Causes and whereby, in case of the Defendants absentin himself, all possible means are used to delay and dis¦appoint the Plaintiffs in their just Suits, to thei great wrong, and abuse of Iustice: Be it therefore Ordained, Enacted and Establishe by the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons None shall be ad∣mitted a Clerk or Atturny in the Courts unless he have served seven years. in this Common Council assembled, and by th Authority of the same, That no person or person whatsoever be henceforth at any time admitted, capable to be admitted, a Clerk or Atturny in th said Mayors Court, or in either of the said Sheriff Courts of this City, before he or they shall bona fid have served some Master-Clerk or Atturny in on of the Courts of this City, as a Clerk, the fu term of seven years; And that every or any Gran Every Admission to the contrary shall be void. or Admission, that shall happen at any time her after to be made contrary to this Act, shall be nu and void, as if it never had béen made: And th no Atturny, Clerk, or Officer, of or belonging to th No Atturnie, Clerk, or Officer, to become Bail. Mayors Court or Sheriffs Courts, or their Clerk or Servants, nor any of them, do or shall, at an time from and after the twenty third day of Octobe instant, presume to become Bail for any person or pe¦sons whatsoever, in any Action, Attachment, or othe Suit or Cause whatsoever, that shall be entered, com¦menced, or depending, in the said Mayors Cou or Sheriffs Courts; And that neither the Clerk
he Bails in the Mayors Court, nor Clerks of the Papers, nor Clerk-sitters of the said Sheriffs Courts, nor any of them, nor their or any of their Clerks or Servants, nor any other whose duty it is to take the Bails, do presume, from and after he said twenty third day of October instant, to take, cept, and enter upon Record, any of the said At∣turnies, Clerks, or Officers, or any of their Clerks r Servants, for the Bail of any person or persons whatsoever, or their or any of their Promise or En∣gagement, to save harmless such Clerk or other Of∣icer, for taking of any other person or persons to e Bail in any Cause whatsoever, to be therein de∣ending. And to the end that the said City-Courts, as well None but Subsidy-men, or persons of like quality, to be Jurors. he Mayors as the Sheriffs Courts, may be supplied om time to time with able and sufficient Iury∣en, Be it farther Ordained and Enacted by the said ord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Com∣on Council assembled, and by the Authority of the me, That no person or persons whatsoever be at y time hereafter returned, by any the Inquests of he Wards of this City, to serve as Iury-man, or ury-men, either Grand, or Petty, in the Courts of his City, but such men as either have béen, or for me to come shall be, Subsidy-men, and so taxed in he KING's Books; or, in default thereof, such ther discréet and sufficient persons as shall be qual in Quality▪ and Estate with them: And that he Issues upon Default of Iury-mens Appearan∣s be constantly levied, and duly and truly answered. The Mayors Court, being a Court of Law and Equity, and su∣perior to the Sherifs Courts, hath power of Levating Causes out of those Courts. And whereas the said Court, called the Lord ayors Court, is an ancient Court of Record, herein Causes, both of Law and Equity, and also ttachments, are determinable, and the same Court
is superiour to the Sheriffs Courts; And wherea also the Lord Mayor for the time being, of ancien Custome and constant practice, hath, and time where¦of the memory of man is not to the contrary ever had power and authority, by his Warrant called a Leve¦tur Querela, to remove Causes from and out of th Sheriffs Courts into the Lord Mayors Court, with¦out any restriction or limitation of time, so as th same Levetur be brought before the Iury, or any o them, (summoned for trial of such Cause or Causes▪ shall be sworn; And whereas of very late time suc Levetur hath béen often disallowed, contrary to th said ancient Vsage, and in Contempt of the sai Mayors Court, upon several new pretences, neve heard of till of late time, whereby Clients are ne¦cessitated (especially where they have cause to appea to Equity) to remove their Suits out of London i to other Courts, whereas they might otherwise b relieved in the Lord Mayors Court, with far less Charge and greater Expedition: For remedy hereof it is Ordained, Enacted an No Judge or Clerk of the Sheriffs Courts shall disallow any evetur brought be∣fore the Jury sworn. Established, by the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, an Commons, in this Common Council assembled and by Authority of the same, That at all times her after the said Warrant of Levetur Querela, unde the hand of the Lord Mayor or Recorder of the Cit of London for the time being, for removing of an Plaint, Attachment, or other Cause or Causes, lev¦ed or depending in either of the Sheriffs Courts this City, into the Mayors Court, (being brough by a Serjeant at Mace and Minister of the Mayor Court to the said Sheriffs Courts, either at th Guild-Hall or Compter, at any time before the Iur or any of them, shall be sworn for trial of such Caus or Causes,) shall be presently obeyed and allowed o
And that neither the Iudge, nor any Clerk or Offi∣cer, of either of the said Sheriffs Courts, do at any time hereafter presume to reject or disallow of any such Levetur Querela, so brought or tendered un∣to him or them, upon any pretence whatsoever, other then in case of a farther Order or Warrant, by and under the Hand of the Lord Mayor or Recor∣der for the time being, in that behalf first had and obtained, as anciently hath béen used and ac∣customed. And to prevent the daily Inconveniences happen∣ing The Novel device▪ Continuances con∣demned and remedi∣ed. in Suits now depending, or hereafter to be depen∣ding, in the Courts of the said Sheriffs, by reason of the great Delays they méet with there by putting off of Causes, under pretence of Continuances entered by the Atturnies on both sides, for the most part at the very time they should be tried, without the Con∣sents of the Parties Clients, contrary to the ancient practice and usage of the said Courts, whereby the Cli∣ent is delayed, Witnesses and Iury-men discouraged, by frequent and fruitlesse Attendances, to the in∣tolerable Expence of the Suitor: For the preventing hereof for the future, Be it Enacted by the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in this Common Council assembled, and by Authority of the same, that no Cause or Causes in either of the Sheriffs Courts be at any time hereafter, from and after Issue joyned, put off from Trial by pretence of any such Continuances entered, or hereafter to be entered, by consent of the Atturnies on either part, but upon motion thereof irst made in open Court, and for some just and rea∣onable cause to be shewed and allowed upon Oath efore the Iudge of the same Court, and upon pay∣ment
of such Costs to the party thereby delayed as the Court shall sée cause to tax and allow; And that no Clerk do henceforth presume to enter any Con∣tinuance in any Cause summoned for Trial, with∣out the special Order and Directions of the Iudge of the Court in that behalf first had, as aforesaid; And that no Fée be henceforth demanded, taken, or allowed, by or to any of the Atturnies of the She∣riffs No Fee upon a Con∣tinuance. Courts aforesaid, for or in respect of the putting off of any Trail, under the pretence of such Conti∣nuance entered, or hereafter to be entered, as afore∣said, upon pein, that every Atturny so demanding, taking, or receiving, shall for every such Offence, Penalty. for the first time, forfeit the summe of five pounds, and for the second, to be finally discharged of and from his place of Atturny in the said Sheriffs Courts. And to prevent the great Mischiefs now daily growing and increasing in the said Sheriffs Courts What Costs shall be taxed in the Sheriffs Courts, and how, for avoiding the pre∣sent Abuses in that ease. by excessive Costs taxed upon Iudgements there given, by the consent, for the most part, of the Attur∣nies of both sides, contrary to the usage of all for∣mer Ages, Be it Enacted by the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in this Common Coun∣cil assembled, and by Authority of the same, That no Bill of Costs, excéeding the summe of four and twenty shillings for the Trial of a Grand-Iury Cause, or excéeding the summe of twenty two shil∣lings for the Trial of a Petit-Iury Cause, shall at any time hereafter charge the Client of either side: Neverthelesse it shall and may be lawful for the Iudges of the said Courts respectively, for good and reasonable cause shewed to them respectively by the Parties of either side, upon due examination of
the circumstances of the Case, (in the presence of both Parties,) to increase the said Costs of Suit by their discretions, by special Rule of Court to be entered for that purpose, expressing the cause why such Costs are so increased: And upon complaint made by any person of greater Charges then as a∣foresaid, and producing the Bill under the Attur∣nies hand, or other Witnesse, that the respective Iudges of the same Court punish the Offender, and relieve the party grieved, according to their good discretions, and the Rules aforesaid: And that no Officer of either of the said Courts shall presume to make out Execution upon any Iudgement, where∣in the Costs of Suit shall excéed the summs afore∣said respectively, without such special Rule as a∣foresaid to warrant the same, on pein to forfeit for Penalty. his first Offence five pounds, to the relief of the Prisoners of that Compter wherein the Action shall be entered; and for the second Default, to be expelled the Court for ever. And to prevent the daily Abuses of the Serjeants and For redresse of sun∣dry Abuses commit∣ted by the Serjeants and Yeomen. Yeomen of the Sheriffs, sometimes in permitting persons arrested by them to goe at large without Bail, sometimes in kéeping them in Ale-houses, or some other private places, and not returning the Pro∣cesse in due time (by which the parties were arrested,) so that the Plaintiff is delayed, and the Prisoner, by the extortion of the said Serjeants and Yeomen, oftentimes put to a greater Expence then will dis∣charge the originall Cause of Action, and sometimes by discharging persons by them duly arrested, with∣out causing the Actions whereon they were so arrested to be withdrawn, although they take money from the Defendant sufficient to do the same with, and some∣times
in not duly returning Executions by them executed, or by discharging persons taken in Exe∣cution before Satisfaction be entered upon Record, whereby the said persons are oftentimes doubly charged for the same Debt; Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Serjeants and Yeomen of the said Sheriffs, and every of them, shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter, make due Returns into the said She∣riffs Courts of all the Precepts of the said Courts to them to be directed, at the next Court after the Execution of the same Precepts: and that all persons by them to be arrested by vir∣tue of the said Precepts, or any of them, shall be either delivered upon good and sufficient Bail, or, in default thereof, by him or them committed to some of the Prisons within the said City, at or before the next Court to be holden after such Arrest so to be made, to the end the party Plain∣tiffe may procéed in his Action according to Law: and that none of the said Officers presume to dis∣charge any person or persons so by him arrested, after Agréements made betwéen the parties, till such time as the said Officer shall have caused ei∣ther the Action to be withdrawn, or Satisfaction to be acknowledged on Record, as the case shall re∣quire. And if any of the said Officers shall here∣after offend in any of the cases aforesaid, and shall be thereof convicted by Examination of the Iudge in open Court, upon complaint of the parties grieved, or, in default thereof, by any other who shall inform the same, That then, and in every such case, the said Officer or Officers so offending shall, for the first Offence, be by the said Iudge
forthwith committed to the Compter, there to remain till he shall have paid down the summe of five pounds, the one moiety to the party grie∣ved, or, in default of Information to be given by him or them; as aforesaid, then to such other person or persons who shall inform the same to the said Court, over and besides such Remedy as the said party grieved may have by his or their Actions at Law against the said Officers, or any of them, for any of the Defaults aforesaid, and the other moiety to the relief of the poor Prisoners in such of the said Compters wherein the said Cause is or shall be entered: and if any of the said Officers, after he or they shall have béen once convicted of any of the Offences aforesaid, shall presume to offend in any of the said cases the se∣cond time, and be thereof convicted, as aforesaid, That then, and in every such case, the said Offen∣der, over and above all other Penalties herein a∣bove limited and appointed, shall be ipso facto absolutely discharged from his said Office; and the Sheriffs of the City for the time being are here∣by impowered and required to nominate and pre∣sent to the Court of Aldermen some other fit∣ting person, to be by them admitted in his or their places, as if the persons so offending and convicted, as aforesaid, were naturally dead. Provided alwayes, that no Informer shall be any wayes intituled to the moiety of the said five pounds, or any part thereof, unlesse the said Of∣fender
shall be convicted by the Evidence of one or more persons indifferent, and unconcerned to the profit or prejudice coming by the Default of the said Officer. Avery. Printed by James Flesher, Printer to the Ho∣nourable City of LONDON, 1669.
