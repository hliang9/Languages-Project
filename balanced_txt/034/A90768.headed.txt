A PLEA FOR MODERATION IN THE Transactions of the Army: OR, VVeighty Observations upon the late Pro∣posalls for Peace, presented by the Honourable City of LONDON, To Commissary-Generall IRETON, for concur∣rence of the Generall Councell. Humbly offered unto the consideration of the Officers of the ARMY; By Veritie Victor Gent. Printed for John Hanes, 1648.
A Plea for Moderation in the Armies Transactions. UPon reading of that Paper called Proposals for Peace and Free∣dome offered to Commissary Generall Ireton, for the concur∣rence of the Army by divers worthy Citizens of the Common Councell, and others, and upon much weighing the matter, I disco∣ver somthing of the substance thereof, and in regard of the strength of reason, even in all things therein touching the present condition of the state of things now with us, (it being the onely wisdome to looke at what best may be, and not at the narrow desires that every mans will coveteth) and as to the honesty thereof; I conceive no reasonable man of what party soever, unlesse the prodigall, or such as desires to live by the ruine of others, can say that there is any thing which tends to any other then the sure contrivance for the settle∣ment of a happy peace, and the maintenance of the due and equall propriety and freedome of all men: wherefore I have thought meet to observe, that first they conclude the King to be the per∣son that hath brought this woe, misery, and lamentable distraction upon the three Kingdomes. Secondly, that they conclude into that true Maxime of the Law, that whatsoever is not just in the begin∣ning, cannot be made just by any Custome of the longest continuane whatsoever; and therefore do first adjudge him guilty of all the blood and ruine of England and Ireland. Secondly, that they are desirous that all usurpations and incroachments upon the peoples Liberties whatsoever, may be immediately taken away: and per∣haps may believe with me, that Kings Courts are the fountaines from whence the streames of excesse doe flow, and (that Kings are the Beasts spoken of in the Revelation of John) that thereby de∣voure the people, and thither also do the subtillest serpents re∣sort, and by their supreme power sting (even unto death) the rest of the silly beasts of the mountaines, and it is they that turn the grace of God into wantonnesse and a lie, exalting with the horn of honour the covetous, the Extortioner, the Damner, Swearer, Who∣rer, Gamester, Cheater, Liar, and lascivious Prodigalls, to the ba∣nishment of godlinesse and true vertue, and all such as (according to the only end for which they were borne) endeavoure righteous∣nesse
for the good of their generation. But considering the great dubiousnesse of the best of men, and that three Kingdomes concen∣tereth in one Crowne, and that through the union thereby since King James came first into England, their Riches as well in Trade as Revenue were (before the warre) increased not lesse then fourfold. Secondly, that none of the three can be highly happy without peace in all. Thirdly, that our old foundations of Government in refe∣rence as aforesaid, cannot be mended, except in the free and more equall choice of the Representative. Fourthly, that since it hath pleased God that a solemne Nationall Covenant hath been made and remaineth between Scotland and us, whereby that Nation re∣quireth mercy on the behalfe of the King as due thereby. Fifthly, for that God is a God of mercy, and not of punishment, unlesse as they say, it will in reason convert into mercy. Sixtly, for that their provisions for peace and freedome against all Tyranny is in reason unviolable through a generall agreement to be founded by this great and honourable City (out of Arms) upon as certaine provisi∣ons therein as can be laid down. Seventhly, that the union between the Scots and us may be preserved, and their peace setled as well as ours. Eightly the sudden reducement of Ireland. Ninthly, the con∣viction of all the particular parties of the pure Parliament Inte∣rest, together againe. Tenthly, although it cannot be imagined that godly States-men will intend the alteration of a Government for the worse, for that is not to be expected at the hands of the most e∣vill Machivillians, for by the goodnesse of the things laid downe must their supportation in strength, honour, and fame be. But ne∣cessity hath ever been observed to force the fairest promising States∣men upon alterations of the Government of Nations into the height of Tyranny and cruelty, especially where a new Govern∣ment is ushered in by feare, that opposite to love and freedome, nor can the accomplishment thereof be expected by this generati∣on. And though extreme warrs could be avoided, yet cannot im∣prisonment, hanging, heading, hunger-pining of thousands, nay likely ten thousands, and in the end may the worke come into as evill hands as this Tyrant, at large, our present King; but in the Cities way there is nothing but certainties in reason, for binding their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with links of iron, yet by a sweet yoke, and pleasant bonds to the producement of their greatnesse peace and honour, as well as the peoples. Eleventhly, I further observe, that the King deserved death even long before the warres through the violations of our Lawes, his Oath and Covenant (besides that of his Father) but more especially for all the evill done
in the first war, untill August and September, 1647. when notwith∣standing he was concluded to be the same in resolution, touching the evill of his heart, as at first, when notwithstanding so great tender∣nesse was had not onely of his life, but to his Negative voice also. And wherefore now if more could not be fought for, or expected as to freedom, then may be had by the continuance of his life, much better then by his death, as if mentioned by all the foregoing reasons, why then may not mercy be afforded him, & not to run the hazard of destruction & confusion to the whole three Nations. And again for that the Prince and Duke of York are both abroad, therefore must we not only expect present contests and Warres with Scotland and Ireland, but with most of the Adjacent Princes in Europe, which cannot but immediately destroy our old and famous Trade of Mer∣chandize; For which considerations, as also for the supportation of those hundreds of thousands of People of this City, and likewise for the mainenance of the manufactory of the whole Kingdome, must the Citizens be for ever reputed both pious, moderate and wise, if againe they presse forward herein. In their Paper I further ob∣serve, that they would have the King disarmed of those two poy∣soning swords of destruction, whereby all Princes (together with their serpents about them) destroy the Nations, viz. the power of dignifying with Offices, and also with Titles of honor, whomsoe∣ver best serveth their lusts; and indeed should he have been brought in naked, these two excepted, if the Parliament should have con∣tinued but a few yeares longer, it would not have been difficult and hard unto him (by those two baites of honor) to have drawn the Angells of heavenly knowledge and starrs of great light unto the earth againe, when having courted in the idoliz'd & deisi'd heads of the particular parties, the rest following of course, would thus have made the Nation slaves of what degree soever he had pleased: Is any thing for Nations freedom like bonds to Ambition? And were it but the fashion for Kings to discountenance vice, and dignifie vertue, they would then merit their Crownes, for which onely end they first had them; for then would righteousnesse and vertue shine forth in the Nation, as the fashionable things; and debauchery and excesse fall to disdaine. They also in their Paper have sufficiently provided for a godly preaching Ministery, with an augmentation of more then one third of that of old, by avoiding the Ministers ac∣customed charge of gathering and converting Tythes, as the avoi∣ding of suite, trouble and contention thereupon, besides the more equall consideration for the labors and paines of those that shall be appointed thereto, which although not the same with the Scots,
yet for that it wholly thwarteth not the Covenant (not admit∣ting the civill Magistrate a Judge in point of conscience) is well reli∣shed by them, notwithstanding a generall Liberty of Conscience to all godly conscientious walkers; protesting against the State-de∣stroying Tenents as to peace and freedome not only of Popery, E∣piscopacie, and all Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, by Courrs and Offices to that purpose. And did they think that the punitive power men∣tioned by them in their Remonstrance of June 1647. in point of Conscience, had even justly brought these great evills upon them and the Nation, but not find that is not the thing, as witnesse the judgment of some powerfull persons in debate, and yeilding the thing, if it would have been accepted on in another (though a worser) manner. Their Noble care that the souldiery in generall may be payed all their Arreares due unto them, and so as cannot but be to the great advantage of the State by improvement of that wilfull wast formerly made, as may soone be some millions to the benefit of the State; as also to the well pleasing both of Lord and Tenant, and the gladding and making joyfull of the hearts of many thousands of the poore that are now ready (even daily) to perish with want, and are not onely contented that the renowned Army should be presently satisfied, and by lands payed as followeth, viz. for every yeare that every Trooper is in arreare, or proportionable in time thereunto, the summe of foure pounds du∣ring his life, without defalcation of free-quarter; and that every Foot-Souldier that is in arreare, may have fifty shillings a yeere for every yeere due unto him, during his life, with proportion to time as to the Horse aforesaid; and without defalcation for free-quarter also; and that those which shalbe thought meet by the general Coun∣cel of the Army to be dismissed for Ireland, have the Fee-simple ther∣of to them and their heirs for ever. And it is now commonly spoken in the City, they are further content, that what was formerly assigned to the Souldiery for term of life, may be conferred upon them for ever: And that those that shall be dismissed to Ireland, as aforesaid, may have their proportions increased to one fourth part more then is now assigned; and will also upon security of the intended lands for that purpose, if the generall Councell shall think meet, pay in ready money all such arreares as shall be due either to any Officer or souldier, by order from the generall Councell aforesaid: And fur∣ther, I conceive, greater indeavours for the preservation of the Ar∣mies honour and interest, both in England and Ireland, cannot be ex∣pected, beyond what is laid down in the Cities paper of Proposalls: and do they expect their chiefest safety to be concerned in them, as
further appeareth by that power reposed in that excellet and ho∣norable Committee for the dispose of all Offices, degrading, and dignifying with titles of honor all such as pleaseth that Committee: But if what is desired by the honourable Citizens may not be per∣mitted, but that wars must still be our portion, or a settlement by the Sword onely, we cannot expect better then in all the world besides, viz. that how just soever the Government is chalked out and inten∣ded to be, yet must we have no more thereof meted unto us, then the leading persons of State will in the future be pleased to afford us: and may it be our portion with Germany, where the People have by right of Agreement, not only the choice of their Emperor, and many of their Kings and Princes, but of their Lawes also, yet may not according to truth have choice in either, but are lamen∣table slaves; for it is not as Lawes are made, but as the Power plea∣seth, that putteth them in execution, whether to call truth false∣hood, or falsehood truth, as witnesse our introachments and usir∣pations by false Judges that have brought forth all these our distrac∣tions, to obtain honour from the Beast: And in this, and this only resteth, and wholly dependeth our Freedome; viz. to indeavour and obtain the avoiding of all force and Warres, whereby we may without delay put our now knowne Rights in execution, to the present commanding of King, Lords, and People to an immediate obedience upon the present incurment of the strictest penalty of the Law, and when wee be at Peace: then will the severity of punish∣ing the breakers of the Nationall Law (for the preservation of the publique Peace) convert into mercie. But when commotions are, and (that there be many parties in a Nation, and not any one of which, were they uppermost, but would destroy the rest (or so ma∣ny of the rest as should best please) even by a Law, and be cryed up too (by their party) for pure Justice, in this case ought the mo∣tion of the distempered waters, I mean the People, to be truly ob∣served, and for them that will professe Christ, to indeavour as medi∣ators to lay the distempers, and if they in reason see that advan∣tage to a happy peace maybe obtained by sparing of one or more of the leaders of one party, (and the like of another) after whom God hath been pleased to suffer the hearts perhaps of thousands, 10. thousands, or millions of people to be drawne out after, (though by a delusion or a lye as some may call it, yet as they or some of them may conceive truth) and that thereby the boysterous falt waves may cease further to swell, untill a conjunction by fresh-wa∣ters
may in time happily refine them; this rule of Christianity and reason. And through the freedome and frequentnesse of Parliaments, will all, not only all old and beastly customes be avoided, and evill Lawes repealed, but what is best and most seasonable for a generall good, be provided for; as also if honest men be chosen for Mem∣bers thereof, (perhaps) they may act honest things for 5. or 6. moneths for Gods sake, If knaves (for the Peoples) for Populari∣ty sake, nor will any have opportunity to act much evill in so short a time; and what is not well done in one Parliament, will be mended in the next: for by the frequentnesse thereof, will all men be acquainted with what is freedome, and what is slavery, and where the Breach is, which by long sitting of Parliaments, or the long vacations thereof, (as wofull experience teacheth the Nation) a forced ignorance to the distruction of Freedome must follow. This I thought necessary to speak touching some few particulars, of the Paper of the Citizens Proposalls, and could I earnestly desire that the godly Officers of the Army and souldiers also would view them well, especially all such as look not asquint (as the floating Courtyer used to do that neither look't back to his Father, or on the right or left hand to his Brothers, Sisters, Kinsfolk and acquaintance: Or to what may ensue to his Childrens Children, and others of the Generations to come) and would shew what is wanting therein to the settlement of the present peace with the maintenance of all due and equall propriety, and unalterable Freedome, to all insuing Po∣sterities (theirs and the private souldiers Honourable and great re∣ward with more certainties then otherwise themselves can propose) but if the matters proposed be unanswerable in reason, that then they would endeavour the acceptance thereof. Friends, it is my burthen, that the actions of Christ have been so much neglected by some whose name is so precious in their mouths, that their righteousnesse & humility shines not forth after that man∣ner, as the Beams therof might melt the name of all other Kings, and whereby I am forc'd to be an Advocate for the Title of a King, whose name I abhorre as they are the standards of Ambition, and Fountaines of excesse, to the distruction of the Nations: But of two evills the lesser is to be chosen; and when yesterday cannot be cal∣led againe, let the best be made of the day present: and it is more safe to have to doe with a musled Lion, then a tame serpent. FINIS.
