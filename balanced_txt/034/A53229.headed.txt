The value of the Books as above, being sufficiently known to be the Prizes they have been usually sold at, Amounts to 4111 l bu the Lots with their proportion of Blanks, Amounts but to 1255 l. so that the Author receives for his Books little more than one Fourth of the value, which with the possibility of the Great Lots, or the probability of Seven Prizes in Nine Lots, as were drawn in the last, and the Certainty of Receiving in Books much more than their money, is Encouragement enough to the Adventurer. But this is sufficiently understood by many. Those that please to put in part of their money, Enter their Names and so be Drawn in Course, may be pleased to come or send to the Author's  at the Black boy, over against St. Dunstans Church in Fleet-street. The time will be Certain, within Two Months from  Sixth of January, 1668.
