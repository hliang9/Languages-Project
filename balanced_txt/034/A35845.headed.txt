To all the Faithfull and Suffering Mem∣bers in all Holes, Prisons and Goals, for the Word of God and Testimony of Jesus Christ; with the rest of the Faithful where-ever scatter'd upon the face of the Earth. Dear Brethren and Sisters; HEar the Word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, Though you now drink the Cup of Adversity, and eat the Bread of Affliction, and are tram∣pled upon, as though you were not worthy to live upon the Earth, yet notwithstanding all the Fury of men, you are resolved in the strength of my Spirit forever to be deprived of the sweet enjoyments of Wife, Husband, ten∣der Children, Parents, and outward Possessions, Liberty and Life, before you deny the Testimony of my Name before the Sons of men. Oh! you dear and tender Chil∣dren, who love not your Lives unto Death this day, that you may finish a good Testimony for the Glory of my Name, saith the Lord God; lift up your heads in the Light of my Covenant, and believe in my Name, for I am near unto you, saith the mighty God of Safety; and let not any weight or burden lie upon you; for I will be more than Husband to Wife, and more than Wife to Husband, or Parents to Children, or Children to Parents; yea, I will be a Husband to the Widdow, and a Father to the Children who are deprived of their tender Parents
for my Name sake: I will enlarge your Borders in the Life of my Righteousness; you that suffer in true Inno∣cency, will I refresh with the depth of my Mercies; yea, I will guard you with the Angels of my presence, and all that devise Mischief against you shall be confounded be∣fore the Glory of my Power, with which I will keep and preserve you in the Word of my Patience, and Safety, in my Presence, saith the Lord God. Therefore you dear Children, who drink the deepest in Sufferings, think it not hard, for it is my purpose unto you all that have not any Eye to Self, but alone seek my Glory in all you do; I will make you more and more Honourable in the Glory of my Life, and double my Blessings upon you and yours; for I have beheld your Integrity, and my Bowels are mightily moved with Com∣passion towards you; therefore am I risen for your sakes this day, to declare unto you, my suffering People, That not an Hair of your Head shall perish, neither shall you be detained in Prisons and desolate Holes any longer than I have determined shall be for your eternal Good, and the Glory of my Name forever; Therefore in my Life stand faithful, in resistance of every evil Thought, or whatever would cause you to murmer, or desire any thing but what you know will advance the Glory of my Name, and the Exaltation of my Truth, over all that riseth up against it in your being truly subject to the measure of my Light and Life, that will not let any seek a Pre-eminence or esteem amongst men; neither let Self-striving nor Self-serving have power in any; but in true Humility, Love and Meekness watch one over another; and let the strong take the weak by the hand, that you may all gently in Love, Meekness and holy Fear dread my Name, and serve one another, that your Love may be manifest unto me, saith the Lord your God, and one unto another
in the naked simplicity of your Spirits, then will I make my Dwelling amongst you, and with you; and my dreadful and glorious Presence you shall all feel mightily in you and amongst you, moving in the exercise of my Spirit, to the Renown of my Name and the Comfort of one another, and I will crown you with heavenly Blessings and the glory of my power∣ful Life; and you shall praise my Name forever that I made you my Jewels, and counted you worthy to suffer for the Testimony of my Name. I will go before you through all the Waters and Floods of Afflictions; and I will appear with you before all the Councils of the Sons of men; and my saving Power shall compass you about in your hot and sharp Afflictions, all you who have your Confidence alone in me, the LORD your GOD. There∣fore trust in my Name, ye my dear Children, and cast all your care upon me; And if any of you joyfully suffer the Spoiling of your Goods, I will supply with what is needful for you and yours: And if any of you seal your Testimony in the Word of my Patience with your Blood, I will take care of your tender Wives and Children, or Parents, for whom your Souls have been poured forth in Prayers unto me for their good. Therefore hear my Word which is sounded unto you from the Throne of my Grace and eternal Glory; Re∣joyce not too much in Spiris being made subject, but throw down your Crowns before me, that there be not a Self-seeking, Self-serving Spirit in the Family of my People; but all feel the Birth Immortal raised up in the Resurrection of my Life in you all, which truly makes Self of no Reputation, so that all Loftiness be laid low, and all Haughtiness bowed down in every one, that I the Lord God in you all may be loved, obeyed, and exalted; who is taking, and will take to me my great
Power, to exalt the Meek upon the Earth, and reign over all the Pride of the Children of men (that is exalted above my Witness in their Conscience) that so my Sons may be brought from far, and my Daughters from the ends of the Earth, in the sight of all People whom I will make to confess, in Subjection to my Power, That you are the beloved People of the most high God, and of the Righteous Seed, which the Lord hath blessed; and not any Weapon formed against you shall prosper, but come to nought, which will be hastened for your Comforts, and certainly performed according to what is here declared, to your Eternal Joy; and you shall assuredly know the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The Word of the Lord, before expressed, came to me in the Prison-House in Warwick, which constrained me to send it to be read amongst you, dear faithful and suffering People of the Almighty God, in whom I remain your Brother and Companion in Tribulation and Kingdom of Patience in the Lord Jesus Christ.
