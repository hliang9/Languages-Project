Gods Proclamation TO THE INHABITANTS AND PEOPLE OF ENGLAND. Published by one of the Lords Servants, called forth out of darknesse to be a Witness unto the Everlasting Light of the Son of GOD. According to the Word of the Lord which came unto him on the fifth day of the ninth moneth, 1659. Known by the name of JOHN ANDERDON. The Lord hath spoken that the Rod of the wicked shall not alwayes be on the back of the Righteous. LONDON, Printed for Giles Calvert at the Black spread Eagle at the West end of Pauls, 1659.
REpent, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and the patience and long suffering of God is almost at an end The Kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, who must Reign until all his enemies are subdued, and the greatness of the Dominions under the whole heavens shall be given into the hands of the saints of the most High God, such as faith∣fully follow the Lamb in the Regeneration, in his righteous war against the beast and false Prophet within and without, which have combined together to make war against the Lamb and his followers & have given their power to the Prince of this world, the Dragon cast out of Heaven, the Devil that old serpent, that hath deceived the Nations, whose followers ye are that rebel against the light, and love darkenss rather than light because your deeds are evil, having chosen to follow your own hearts lusts, and vain and wicked imaginations, which is out of the fear and councel of the Lord God of light and life. How long, how long, will ye turn the truth of God into a lye? and the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like unto corruptible man, whose breath is in his nostrils? How long will men forsake the Lord, the Fountain of living waters, and draw waters out of broken Cisterns full of pollu∣tions and defilements? How long will ye follow after vani∣ties, and forsake your own mercies? How long will ye seek the living amongst the dead? How long will ye follow the builders of Babel, whose Language is confounded with many Tongues, and set at nought, Christ Jesus the chief corner stone, whose building is in spirit and truth, a City whose maker and bulider is God, which is at unity within it self? How long will ye follow after lyes, and heap up to your selves teachers after your own corrupt hearts lusts, that justifie the Wicked and condemn the Just, that call good evil, and evil good, that put Light for Darkness, and Darkness for Light, and refuse to be taught and led by the spirit of truth,
which will lead you out of your own inventions (out of the impure) into the pure way and worship of God, which is in spirit and in truth? How long will ye cry up a Kingdom without in words, and neglect to seek to know Gods Kingdom within in power; That in the heart where the root of the Tree is that bringeth forth evil fruit the Axe may be laid, That by the everlasting light of the son of God, ye may come to see what is good and what is evil in your selves, to a clear understanding of the difference between the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, and the Fruit of the Tree of Life, unto which an enterance is no way to be had, but under the flaming sword of Gods wrath and anger, against that which hath joyned to the seed of the Serpent, in the transgression of man from the righte∣ous Law of God. That through the Law ye may become dead to the Law, that through the death of all that is contrary to God, ye may come to know and witness life in your selves, redemption by the blood of Jesus which saveth from all sin, that ye may be no longer false witnesses, to tell of things that ye have not seen, but that ye may all come to know the work of God wrought in your selves, that ye may no longer glory and boast in another mans line; but that through the sensible operation of the word of life in your selves, ye may all become Preachers of righteousness in your Generations, according to your measures of what you have seen, tasted and handled of Gods good word of Grace: That the new birth which is af∣ter the spirit, and sensibly and certainly to be known and felt in the creature, through many sore pangs and hard tra∣vel, may be brought forth; not a thing in notion, but in truth the onely way to life, without which, none can enter into Gods Kingdom; and if ye are not witnesses of this in your selves, all the experiences and records thereof by others will be lit∣tle available to you, but to stand as a witness against you. Verily, Eternal life is of highest concernment, therefore search and seek diligently, until ye find it. And certainly, ye can have no other true hopes thereof then ye witness a death unto sin in your selves, and a Resurrection unto life by
the spirit of Christ; you must know your selves Gods work∣manship in Christ Jesus, and know the sore travel of soul, until ye be formed again into the likeness of Gods image, in him, that ye may witness Christ in you the hope of glory; all other hopes are but the hope of the hypocrites, which shall perish. As ye have all been in the degeneration from God in the actual transgression joyned to the seed of the serpent, that drew man into the fall, so ye must all actually and really know the work of regeneration in your selves, by the eternal power of Gods spirit, working out and destroying the works of the Devil in the creature, by joyning him again unto the Seed of God, in whom redemption and deliverance is; In the manifestation of the measure of Gods good spirit given to every man to profit withal, the work is to be known and waited in. That so in man where Satans seat and dominion hath been, which hath led the creature captive into sin and transgres∣sion, that there also Gods Kingdom and Dominion in Christ Jesus, the power of God may be witnessed (truth in the in∣ward parts) working out and destroying all that's contrary to the pure nature of Gods seed, Christ; That so by the blood of Christ, the righteousness of God, the creature may be clean∣sed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and redeemed up to God again by the word of reconciliation; that so, that which hath led the creature captive to sin, may now be led into cap∣tivity, that so as sin by mans disobedience hath reigned un∣to death, so by the resurrection of the just (Christ in us) righteousness may reign unto life everlasting; that as ye have yeelded your members to be the weapons of unrighteousness unto sin, so now ye may yeeld your selves servants of righte∣ousness unto holiness; Truly so, not in word, but in life and power is Gods Kingdome to be known and manifested in you. That as ye have been under Satans power in the transgressi∣on and alienation from God; so now, by Gods eternal spi∣rit ye may be brought to be subjects of Gods power in Christ Je∣sus the seed of God, whose right it is to reign in the heart, and in the World in truth and righteousness. Yea, and his Kingdom is to be set up on top of all deceit and deceiveableness
of unrighteousness, which long hath fate in the seat of God, and lifted it self above all that is called God; the Devil ha∣ving bewitched the Nations to believe a lye, to lead them forth from that which is pure of God within, which would shew men the way of life, to look abroad to powers and do∣minions, and inventions without conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, where the Prince of this World rules, and so keeps men to be bond-slaves to himself, following their lust∣full imaginations, and he in subtilty keeps possession of the house within as a strong man armed against the appea∣rance of the seed of God in the heart, where Satans Kingdom must be destroyed. And so long as he can keep men from turning to the work of God within, he in peace keeps his hold, and shews the creature with his guile and deceit, as at the begin∣ning, that the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil (the in∣ventions and wisdom of man in the fall) is pleasant and good for food. But indeed and truth in the cool of the day, when Gods voice comes to be heard, it's found to be but the increase of sorrow, and bitterness to the soul, when by the everlasting Light of the Son of God all false coverings and pretences are made manifest, and in Gods wisdom (Christ in us) all this wisdom of the World found to be foolishness, and not able to fathom, or comprehend, or give the knowledg of the things of God, which are spiritual, which seeth over and above all deceit and deceiveableness of unrighteousness, set up in the Worldly principle, in the carnal mind, which canot please God, being at enmity against the Seed of God, in which he is well pleased, out of which all your services and worships are but abomination in the sight of the Lord, which maketh desolate, being but false coverings of Antichrist, while he rules in the heart; and ye ne∣ver come to know a separation made in the earth, between the seed of the Serpent and the seed of the Woman working in the heart of man; by one of which two powers, all creatures are guided and led forth to act, and until ye come to true judgement, in the light to discern, ye know not by which power ye are acted, and so bring forth nothing but confusion, and are servants of sin and Satan, under a pretence of righte∣ousness and zeal for God; yet all out of the life and power of
truth, whose voice must be heard, and is known by the sheep of Christ, from all false teachers and deceivers, who have put on sheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, that rob God and Christ of his right within, and raven from the spirit of life, which ought to be the onely guide to the crea∣ture in the performance of duties towards God and man; all other performances, are but images and likenesses of things begotten and brought forth from a false power, crying up self-righteousness without, and let sin and iniquity reign within, from which corrupt root, all that proceeds is but bitter fruit. It is the great design of Antichrist to keep people from the power of God within (Christ in us) and to perswade them to high performances in the imaginations and imitation without which pleaseth the carnal mind, and makes, pahaps, a fair shew in the flesh. But this child, though as goodly as Ishmael that came from Abrahams loynes after the flesh, yet it is not the heir of the promise according to the Covenant of life. Assuredly that which is begotten of God, and brought forth of a Vir∣gin, is the heir of Gods Kingdome; all other are but false births from the seed of the bond-woman, which with her son, though never so stately, is to be cast out, and not to be heir with the son of the free-woman. Let him that hath an Ear hear what the spirit saith: Judas the Traytor hath gotten himself into an high form of words; Hail Master, and kissed him, much for deceitful greetings, as most false teachers are, and the Pharisees that crucifie the Lord of life, can make clean the out-side of the cup and platter. Ʋnless your righteous∣ness exceed theirs, ye shall not enter into Gods Kingdom. Pilate being warned of the woman (that was in the trans∣sion) may wash his hands, and yet give unjust judgement to crucifie the innocent Lamb of God. The highest and greatest Professors of the letter and words without, can joyn unani∣mously together to cry out against the life (within the City of Gods habitation) crucifie him, crucifie him, and so carrie him without the Gates (where are Dogs, Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and whoso∣ever loveth and maketh a lye) there the Lord of life is put to death.
Wolves in sheeps cloathing, counterfeits that deceive the World, having killed Gods witness within, they hate, perse∣cute and devour Gods witnesses without, whose testimony is from the life of truth, which discovers all their false coverings, they having lost the sheeps nature within, they make it their work to prey upon and destroy Gods Lambes without, whose blood cryes loud from the earth for vengeance upon those ungodly and wicked men, those idol shepheards, that sell souls for morsels of bread and handfulls of Barley; those Ministers of unrighteousness, who by their lyes and lightness have caused thousands to err from the truth of God, running greedily after the errour of Balaam for the wa∣ges of unrighteousness, that are called of men Master, who loves the uppermost seats in the Synagogues, receive honour one of another as unbelievers do; and many follow their pernicious ways, whereby the way of truth is evil spoken of, blind guides, haters of the light, deceitful, heady, high-minded, proud, covetous, whose spots of uncleanness are seen in their flesh without, proceeding from the power of darkness within, which rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience: workers of inqiuity they are, the seed of evil doers, that say and do not, that under pretence make long prayers to de∣ceive, fast and pray to smite with the fist of wickedness, and to murther the just, who is more righteous then themselves; Cursed children they are, such as the Lord hates, and never sent them in his service, neither do they his work, but the works of their father the Devil they do, who was a lyar from the beginning, and aboad not in the truth. And will this people alwayes follow the errour of the wicked, and believe in lyes, and never come to the Light to try the spirits that are gone forth into the world; Know you not that the Scriptures of truth testifie, That that spirit is true that con∣fesseth that Christ is come in the flesh, for the grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to walk righteously, soberly, and godly in this present world. And do not these deceivers live in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, and are they not of Anti∣christ? Try them by their fruits, they are made manifest.
Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, and Figgs of Thistles? Believe them not, for there is a lying spirit in the mouth of these Priests, and false Prophets, and be ye separate and come out from amongst them, and partake not any longer with them in their sins, least ye also partake with them in their Plagues, which assuredly shall fall upon this wicked Ge∣neration of men, that will not have the Lord to be the Tea∣cher of his people. How long will ye give your selves up to sottishness, blinde∣ness and ignorance, as not to come to the Light, that you may see where you and they are in the Dark under false cover∣ings: What cry them up for Ministers of Christ, which should be cloathed upon with the robes of his righteousness, made white in the blood of the Lamb? Try them, are they such? Nay, verily they are such as have dyed their garments red with the blood of Christs Saints and servants, read the truth hereof in their barbarous and bloody cruelty, acted upon the bodies and goods of the people called Quakers throughout England, the Saints of the most high God they are so, and the Lord will own them to be so, to the shame and confusion of all their enemies, though now they gnash their teeth at them, and grin like Dogs, crying out, help, help, O Magi∣strates, or else we are undone, or the like of that; A confe∣deracy, a confederacy, report, and we will report it, and make lyes their refuge, which from the beginning to the end hath been the practice of their Father the Devil. Balak and Balaam together consult against this people, that are come up over against them, whose God is the Lord great and mighty. The Priests and People, Jews and Gentiles, combine to∣gether to betray the Son of man into the hands of sinners. The beast and false Prophet, the Whore arrayed in Purple and Scar∣let colour, that sits upon many waters, peoples, Tongues and Languages the Priests original, Mystery Babylon, the mother of Harlots, false Churches and false worshippers have made themselvs drunk with the blood of the Saints that have suffer∣ed for the Testimony of Jesus; Yet would have People believe that Christ is their Saviour: So drunk are people with the Whores cup of Fornications, that they are blinde and given
up to believe lyes; they can sit at ease in the flesh, and talk of God and Christ afar off, but cannot indure that the truth should come nigh them. What, is the Kingdom of God within, is the light within, Christ to be known within, the word nigh thee in thy heart and in thy mouth? Truly this may seem strange, that that God whom ye have ignorantly worshipped so long afar off, should be so nigh in the heart, and doth God require truth in the inward parts, where Satans reign and Kingdom hath so long been, and must that old housholder of iniquity be turned out withal his deceitful Merchandize and profitable crafts? This sets all the world in an uproar that lyeth in wickedness, and the witness of God begins to make the wicked cry out, let us alone, Why art thou come to torment us before the time? Must it be so indeed, that Christ alone must have the Kingdom? and may not Pride, Covetousness, and other lusts of the flesh and works of darkness stand with this King∣dom of God in the heart of man and in the world to be set up? Nay, out must all sin and iniquity, all thy old lovers, pleasures, profit, honour, credit, all must be forsaken for Christs sake, or else thou shalt never be found worthy of him; and as thou hast in thy unregenerate estate been wholly a ser∣vant of sin, so now in the regeneration thou must wholly and faithfully follow Christ the Saviour to redeem thee from all sin, and give thy self up, body, soul and spirit, a living sacrifice unto God, that so being in Christ Jesus, thou mayest with him in Gods dominion (which man lost in the fall) reign with him in righteousness over all deceit and unclean∣ness, within and without, and in God thy maker live, move, and have thy being. Is it so (some may say) this seems to be hard sayings, and who then shall be saved? what must we leave all in truth with∣out deceit? yea, and deny your selves as the Scriptures te∣stifie, and take up the dayly cross to the carnal mind that hath gone a whoring after false worships and strange Gods, that the enmity may be destroyed that's in you, or else ye cannot be Christs Disciples, nor witnesses of the word of Reconciliation, without which ye cannot be saved, whatever other hopes ye have, they are but dead hopes, and such as ye shall be asha∣med of.
It's an easie matter to read and talk of the way to life, to be a strait and narrow way, and that few there be that find it, and to talk of Christs sufferings at Jerusalem; Death and destru∣ction hath heard the fame of wisdom and can preach thereof, but to witness the straightness of the way to the Kingdom, and the measure of Christs sufferings to be fulfilled in your selves, without which ye shall not reign with him in glory; This you will finde not to be a work of flesh and blood, nor accord∣ding to the will of man, but a work wrought by the arm of Gods salvation, that can give life to the dust of the earth; That all Pharaohs Magicians shall be made to know and con∣fess to the truth of God, that this is the Finger of God. Know ye not, or hath the God of this World wholly blin∣ded your eyes, that the Devils rage appeareth and the myste∣ry of iniquity then works strongly, when the life and power comes nigh him that destroyes his work and kingdom. Pha∣roah and his mighty Host rageth mightily when Israel should be gone out of his bondage to serve the living God. The Scribes and Pharisees, Priests and Elders, Rulers and Peo∣ple can delight themselves to talk of the Law and the Pro∣phets which fore-tell of Christs coming, and can make an outward profession accordingly, and can build again the Tombes of the Prophets and adorn the Sepulchers of the Just; Yet when the Just and Holy one comes, they are all of an up∣roar, and the Devil is so high in them, that they charge him that he cast out Devils by Belzebub the Prince of Devils (what strange deceit and wickedness is this, think ye, in professors of the letter) that accounted Christs life madness, and those that followed him fools and mad men, and though the Scrip∣tures which they had testified of him, yet they would not come to him that they might have life, but despised, rejected, and scorned both him and his Doctrine, and never left lay∣ing snares, and watched by false accusations to intrap him, un∣til they had most shamefully crucified him, accounting him not worthy to live. They crucifie the life and set another to bear the cross, as all you formal professors in England do this day, who reject the cross of Christ, whereby the enmity should be de∣stroyed in you, that the life of righteousness might there ap∣pear,
which suffers by your formed weapons; writing at top of the cross in several Languages, This is the King of the Jews: In your vain imaginations, saying, Loe here, loe there, and wote not that the Kingdom of God is within you, where Christ hath long waited to reign; But ye would not have this man to reign over you, but have sent him out of your Coasts, and having lost the sence of his life within, are making likenesses to your selves from the Letter without, seeking for him a∣bout Jerusalem below, not minding where Sodom and Aegypt (spiritually so called) are, where darkness, pride, and ful∣ness of bread, lusts and uncleanness are where the Lord is crucified. Cain slew Abel in the beginning because he was more righ∣teous then himself, and his Sacrifice was accepted with God, but Cains was not. The beast and false Prophet, Gog and Magog, and all the Armies of the Aliens, those that are strangers to Gods Covenant of Light, they now rage and make war against the witness of God, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, now raised from death to life to execute righteous judgements up∣on the workers of iniquity; surely this must needs trouble the world, because their deeds are evil. Come down all ye high and lofty ones from the mountains and hills that ye have set up in your vain imaginations unto the pure principle of God in you, that will shew you that God is worshipped neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem, but in spirit and in truth, no longer in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of the spirit. And this as a witness for the Lord, I testifie and declare to all the world, that all other worships and worshippers, though they make never so fair a shew in the flesh, all their fastings, prayers, preachings, sabbaths, singings, and other perfor∣mances are all abominable in the sight of the Lord, no better then the cutting off a Doggs Neck, or the offering of Swines blood, being a burden to the Lord, the which his soul is wea∣ry to bear. Know O man what ever thou art that pleadest against perfection in this life for any one sin, either pride, covet∣ousness, drunkenness, swearing, lying, or what ever it be,
(let thy cloak or pretence be never so colourable) in thee the Devil hath his Kingdom by consent, and doest thou ex∣pect salvation from them which thou delightest to live in? Knowest thou not, there is no fellowship between Christ and Belial, no communion between light and darkness; and he that is joyned to an Harlot, is one with the Harlot, and he that breaketh one of Gods Commandements is guilty of the whole? Truly the Lord God of heaven and earth hath waited long to be gracious to this Nation, and hath often called them to repentance by his witness within, and visited them by his messengers and servants early and late for several years toge∣ther, but they have hardned their hearts and stiffned their necks, cast the councels of the Lord behind their backs, per∣secuted and scornfully intreated, and despitefully used his messengers, that the Lord God is grieved with this wicked Generation that have chosen their own wayes, and rejected and set at nought Christ Jesus the way to everlasting life, whose right it is to reign, on whom the Government is laid, and he ought to be the King and Law giver in these Nations. And all ye wise builders and setters up of worships and governments in your fallen wisdom which is out of Gods Councel, have but robbed God and Christ of their right. Know ye not that your wisdom is confounded, and ye do but contract shame to your selves? What think ye, pot-shards of the earth, that ye can stand against the Lord God Almighty? Nay, assuredly he will overturn, overturn, and overturn all your forms and frames of Worships and Governments set up without him; see ye not how your enterprizes have been blasted, and your designes against the Lord and his Christ frustrated? yea and so shall all the Councels of the ungodly perish, and the wis∣dom of the wise be turned into foolishness. Know ye not, ye Sects, Formalists, and Notionists, that ye have betrayed the just and righteous principle of God in you, from whence liberty, reformation, righteous Laws and freedom should flow forth, that so from the good old cause, ye are de∣generated into the bad old principle, and having no better hopes, are gone down again into Aegypt for councel and help from the Lords enemies into the dark, ye are gone backward from
the light, ye are waxen fat with Geshurun, and have forgotten the Lord, who brought you up out of the house of bon∣dage, and set you above all the Nations round about you. O ye strong men of the Nations and sometimes valiants of Israel, who hath bewitched you with Sampson to give your strength into Dalilahs lap, that Harlot that will betray you into the hands of the Philistines? and take heed least the end be the same, destruction upon Sampson and the Philistines to∣gether; let them that know themselves concerned herein by the witness of God in them consider what is said, least sudden destruction come upon them, and repentance be hid from their eyes, for the Lords spirit is grieved with this people, and cannot indure that men should deal so deceitfull in his work, that after God hath planted them in Vineyards, and given them to eat the fruit of the Vine, they should rebel a∣gainst him and revolt as back-sliding Israel, that they should take the Son of the husbandman and kill him, that they may have his inheritance. This is great unkindness indeed, that men should thus requite the Lord. What, think ye that ye can hide your selves from the Lord? Nay, verily he will surely search and find out those rebels that will not have his Son to reign over them. What are the Princes of this people become the companions of thieves & robbers, that murther up∣on the way by consent? How is that City wherein righte∣ousness did sometime lodge, now become an Harlot? How are those that have talked of and waited for the coming of Christs Kingdom now turned Apostates, to set up their own greatness instead of Christs righteousness amongst men? how have these people forsaken the Lords Councel given them by his servants, and have taken councel with the ungodly, against him that will break them to pieces and rule them with an iron rod? How long will ye neglect the day of your visitation? Verily the Lord will not be mocked, and let not the long suffering of God be so much abused, for his Spirit shall not alwayes strive with men. Know this of a truth, that if once that day pass over your heads, ye are undone for ever, and repen∣tance shall be for ever hid from your eyes, as it is already past
upon many in this Nation that have slighted and rejected Gods call. What ever false rests or confidence ye build upon, or what deceitful coverings soever ye put on, they will prove too short and too narrow to hide you from the wrath of the Lamb in the day of the Lords reckoning with you, which ha∣stens; Therefore put not far away the evil day, but repent, and return, and work while ye have Light, while it is called to day, for the night cometh when no man can work. Look not back what others have been, or what others have done, but minde your own measure and talent given of God to every one to profit withal, for according to the talent recei∣ved, every mans account and reward shall be. The everlasting light of the Son of God hath shined forth and been preached amongst you of this Nation, unto which ye should have been turned, that so ye might be brought from under Satans power into the power of God. Yea such riches of love hath God shewed to this Nation, that not any Nation in the World, at this time, hath known the like for the ma∣nifestation of himself in the glorious light of the Gospel; to the end, that if they knew the day of their visitation, and the things that belong to their peace, they might be the first fruits of faith unto God of the whole earth, witnesses of the first resurrection of the Just and righteous government of Christ Jesus. Truly the Lord hath done much for this people, and he expects much from them; but behold, instead of bringing forth much fruit unto the Lord, they are turned into a bar∣ren Wilderness full of bryars and thorns; and unless they speedily repent and turn from the evil of their wayes, and come down to own Gods witness in them, and bring all their glory and crowns to the feet of the Lamb, they may ex∣pect no other but certain fearful judgments to be powred out upon them from the righteous hand of God. Friends, this know, that until ye come to own and follow the light, ye remain in darkness, and are out of the way to Gods Kingdom, for the light is the way, Christ Jesus the light of the World, the way to the Father, that hath inlightned every man that cometh into the World, even that voice in thee what ever thou art, that shews thee the evil of thy wayes, and oftentimes reproves and condemns sin in thee, the same is the
grace of God that bringeth salvation, which hath appeared un∣to all men, and therefore look not for another; this is the way that a way fairing man, though a fool, shall not err in, as all in this way must become fools, if ever they expect to be wise unto salvation. In this way Reformation, Liberty, and Freedom, so long contended for, is to be found, Christ in us the hope of Glory, the sum of the whole matter, the beginning and end of all: and what ever ye do without him, ye are but usurpers, and reign without God in the World, and all your buildings that are not upon this foundation shall not stand, but prove as a rotten and broken wall that shall be overturned and shattered to pieces. I say again, and on the Lords behalf challenge it to be Christs right to reign, and ye are but usupers that keep him out of his Kingdom. And according to the word of the Lord which came in∣to me at Bridgewater, in the County of Sommerset, on the fifth day of the ninth moneth, 1659. The burden whereof I have felt and born in much bitterness of spi∣rit, the life of Gods witness in me being pressed down as a Cart with sheaves, by reason of the wickedness of this people, which is very great; (After the space of 24 dayes) have written and again proclaim as the word of the Lord God to you all, high and low, rich and poor, young and old, Inha∣bitants and people of England, to whom soever this paper shall come, whose day is not past. Repent, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and the patience and long suffering of God is almost at an end. Bridge water, writen on the 29 of the 9th. Moneth, 1659. John Anderdon. THE END.
