¶ By the Queene. THE Queenes Highnesse vpon many great considerations for the benefit of her Common weale, doeth will and straightly command all maner of persons of what condition so euer they be, otherwise then such as be, or shall be excused by vnfained sicknesse, or licenced by the authoritie of her Maiestie, or her Progenitors: to absteine from killing, dressing, or eating of any flesh, vpon all such vsuall Fasting dayes, and namely the time commonly called the Lent, vpon paine of her Maiesties indignation and impri∣sonment during her Maiesties pleasure, and such further fine as therefore shall seeme meet. FOR the better execution whereof, her Maiestie chargeth all Iustices of Peace, and all Maiors, Bailiffes, and head officers of Cities and Townes corporate, especially of her Cities of London, and Westminster, vpon proofe by two sufficient witnesses before them had, to commit the offendors thereof to prison, there to remaine during her Maiesties plea∣sure, and to make fine for the same accordingly. AND finally her Maiestie willeth and requireth all such as shall be vpon necessitie and iust cause licenced as aboue is said, that as they regard her Maiesties fauour, they will vse the same as modestly and secretly as they may, both to auoyd excesse, and euill example. Giuen at Our Palace of Westminster, the vij. day of February, the first yeere of Our Raigne. God saue the Queene. Imprinted at London by Richard Iugge, and Iohn Cawoodde, Printers to the Queenes Maiestie. Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
