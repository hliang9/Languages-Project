A New Scotch SONG. Sett by Mr. Daniel Purcell, and Sung in the last Reviv'd Play call'd, The Taming of the Shrew, Or, Sawny the Scot. Sung by Mrs. Harris. 'TWas in the Month of May Jo, when Jockâ•Œey first I spy'd; he luk'd as fair as day too, gu'd gin I'd bin his Bride: With Cole black Eyne, and Milk white Hand, I'se ne'er yet saw the like; I wish I had gin aw my Land, I'se ne'er had seen the tike. II. He fix'd his Eyne upon me With aw the signs of Love; I'se Thought they wou'd gang Through me, So fiercely they did move; He tuke me in his eager Arms, I'se made but faint denials; I'se then alas found aw his Charms, Woe worth such fatal Trials. III. The Bonny Lad at last, Jo, Was forc'd tell gang away; But I'se had eane stuck fast tho', Full Nine Months from that day. And now poor Jenn'ys Mayden-head, Shame on't, they find is lost; The little brat has aw betray'd; Was ever lass thus crost? LONDON, Printed by and for William Pearson, next door to the Hare and Feathers in Alders-gate-street, and Sold at most Musick-Shops in Town. 1699.
