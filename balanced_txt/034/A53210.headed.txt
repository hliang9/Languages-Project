O MOST mighty Lord God, who art our Castle, and our delive∣rer, our defender in whom we trust: save we humbly beseech thee, the Cities now distressed by the Rebells Forces; give them Courage and Fidelity, blesse their Counsells, prosper their Enterprises, and so supply all their wants, by thine infinite fullnesse, that their Assail∣ants may returne back with losse and shame, and that they, and we may therefore praise thy Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord, AMEN.
