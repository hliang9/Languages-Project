The Great Question to be Considered by the KING, and this approaching PARLIAMENT, briefly proposed, and modestly discussed: (To wit) How far Religion is concerned in Policy or Civil Government, and Policy in Religion? With an Essay rightly to distinguish these great In∣terests, upon the Disquisition of which a sufficient Basis is propo∣sed for the firm Settlement of these Nations, to the most pro∣bable satisfaction of the several Interests and Parties therein. By one who desires to Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. THat this Nation, and the Nations of Scotland and Ireland concerned with it, are at present in such a posture, and under such circumstances, as give just rea∣son both of fear and care more then ordinary both to Rulers and People, is so without doubt, that it needs no proof; and that we are in a dangerous Feaver▪ in regard both to our Civil and Religious Interest, all in their wits must know: which Disease, albeit it be now in the opinion of most come to a Crisis, yet few can determine whether it will end in a natural cool, or prove a distemper yet more dangerous and deadly. And truly, at this time we are so far happy, that though the Evil be great which threat∣neth, us, yet the Cause thereof is very manifest, so that we are not put to the disadvantage of an uncertain search in that matter. We see all this trouble proceeds from a pretence of Religion, and Opinion that men have drank in, that for and because of Religion, they ought to concern themselves in the Civil Government of the Nations, yea so far as to overturn it, if otherwise the advancement of their Religion cannot be procured. How much this Opinion, albeit managed by men vastly differing as to the Religion they would advance, has wrought to the shaking of these Nations, few can be ignorant; so that it seems high time, and no season more opportune then now, that this Question were fully decided, What is the Interest of Religion in Policy or Civil Government; and again, of Policy and Civil Government in Religion? And how far men upon the account of Religion may and ought to meddle in the Government, or with the Governours; and again, how far the Civil Magistrate, as such, ought to concern himself in the Consciences of the People? that if possible, such Principles may be pitched upon, agreeable to the nature of Christia∣nity, and to the soundest Principles of Government, by which men may be possessed with a Faith, that Christianity doth not oblige them to meddle in Government, and recipro∣cally that they may be the more quieted in that belief, that the Magistrate is not to con∣cern himself in their Consciences: so that in this mutual assurance, the Magistrate may rule securely, and administer Justice to all equally, without fearing hurt from the Religion of any of his people; and the people may fear God, and follow piety, according to the best of their knowledge, without fearing prejudice from the Magistrate therefore. And truly it cannot but be acknowledged, that it would be a happy Nation where this were fully fixed; and the establishing of such Principles seems the less difficult, that in the purest times of Christianity, (so reputed by all) the true Christian Religion was not at all hurtful nor dangerous to the Magistrate, though differing from it; nor did the Chri∣stians judge it any part of their Religion, to seek to disturb him in his Government, or screw themselves into it: and though again they acknowledged his Authority in Civils to be just and lawful, yet they claimed an exemption from being imposed upon by him in the exercise of their Consciences; so that a re-establishing of those Principles and Practices which were believed and followed, by those who on all hands are affirmed to have been the purest Christians, and also good and faithful Subjects, will do the business. But for the more clear understanding of this matter, it will be fit to take it a little higher, and enquire how those two great Interests of Religion, and Civil Government, came to be interlaced and mixed together. Cain was the first that disturbed Civil Society
because of Religion; and the Scripture, from which alone we may expect it, gives no ac∣count of any thing like the mixing of these Interests before the Floud; and after the Floud, the whole tract of the Hebrew History from Heber to Moses, (for of the particular state of the Jews I shall speak anon)  shew, that the matter of Religion was wholly distinct from the outward Policy and Government then used in the World. Jacob lived in Laban's Family, though differing from them; and Joseph among the Egyptians, with which Super∣stitious Nation we cannot suppose he joyned in Worship, and yet was both a faithful Friend to Pharoah, and considerable Ruler over the People. Moreover, if the true ground and rise of Government be considered, this will more appear; for all Lawyers and States▪men derive the first grounds of Government, from the Posterity of Noah's Sons after the Floud, and do show how through necessity, Reason and the Law of Nature led them thereunto; for the Law of Nature giving to every man a natural and paternal Jurisdicti∣on over his own Family, when as the increase of Mankind, and necessity of Commerce, gave occasion for several Families to be concerned together, and that these concernments begot Controversies needful to be determined, and that every Family stood upon equal foot as to Authority, and to decide by Force would prove destructive, and not necessarily be just, and that it was unfit every man should be Judge in his own cause; therefore Reason led them to chuse men of approved Justice and Honesty, to whom all differences were remitted, and whose decisions served as Laws, and were readily submitted to, the parties resting in the assurance of their equity: and this all Lawyers generally acknow∣ledge▪ was the first foundation of Civil Government, in the joynt agreement of several Fa∣milies; from whence arose the Institution of Cities, and from their Interest in the Coun∣try about the division of Provinces and Kingdoms. Now as in the first part of Govern∣ment in Families, the Authority stood in one▪ viz. in the Father of the Family; so they usually chose one for the Government of joynt Families, who thence were called Kings; and this was the Original of Monarchy: whom the opinion of Honesty, Knowledge and Justice, most readily and without fear of Emulation advanced to that dignity, whose Judg∣ment and Wll answering to the cause of their advancement, was a Law to the People. Afterwards when the respect put upon these Rulers or Kings, and the advantage thence accruing increased, men began to be ambitious of the Imployment, and from thence to use their influence to obtain it; from which followed Faction, and often Bloudshed, which made men fall upon the expedient of letting the Government rest upon the Chil∣dren of those who formerly had possessed it, the Veneration of their Fathers, and the sup∣position and expectation they might inherit their Fathers Virtues greatly contributing thereto; which laid the foundation of Hereditary Monarchy. But when the Primitive simplicity and integrity of those first Ages began to wear out, and that those Kings did extend and advance the Authority they derived from their Predecessors, but lost their Equity and Justice; and since the ancient and entire confidence put in the first Rulers, had made their Government, and consequently their Successors, unlimited, it depending upon Will, and not qualified by any Laws, whereof there were not written at that time▪ Thus Monarchy degenerated into Tyranny, as appeared in Nimrod, and his Successors, the Kings of Assyria, which gave a rise, as many judge, to the itution of Commonwealths amongst the Grecians and others. Now during these times, although the number of those that truly feared God, and re∣tained any  of pure Religion, were very few and for most part (at least▪so far as is conveyed to us in the Family and Success of Abraham; yet that inward and Universal Testimony of a Deity, implanted in the hearts of all men, (as all sorts of Christians ac∣knowledge) did so far influence men, as to set their thoughts about Religion; for as Cicero says Nulla Gens tam Barbara quae Deum aliquem non agnoscat▪ since it is most certain, that Justice will gain a Testimony in the hearts of the most barbarous, the ancient Venera∣tion and esteem to the great Justice and Equity of those Primitive Rulers, being fixed in  and heighned by the depravation of their Successors; and this compared with daily▪  afforded to men in the course of Providence, begot a belief that these things were the Gifts of these Good Kings  in Heaven, from whence they came to be prayed unto, and reputed Gods  And thus those things tht did seem immediately to convey those  the Sun, Moon, and Stars, came  to be adored, from whence sprung the Religion or divers▪ Nations▪ and thus  any  came to receive Power and Do∣mination over others,  became more universally to be received. Now whereas Religion among the Gentiles had its rise so  hence, so every Nation had their prticular , among this Roman , which they were devoted to▪ The  of Religion with  insensibly, since all the Gentiles
generally esteemed it a duty to worship the Gods of that place and Country they came to, as judging they had a sort of distinct and peculiar Jurisdiction there; so there was little occasion of observing here a distinct Interest; because there was no man to claim the liberty of exercising it: so far had blindness and Idolatry overgrown the World. In which state things continued for many Ages, until Daniel and the Three Children, after the carrying a way of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar, gave a rise rightly to distinguish and clear the Marches btwixt Religion and Policy, and claim the liberty of the one, without prejudice to the other; for this making Religion necessary to Policy, took its strength from the un∣limited Tyranny of the Assyrian Monarchy, and was the fruits of an Arbitrary Power, standing and exercised in the superlative degree; (and it's observable, that where there is most of that sort of Government, there this, to this day, most prevails; this being most suitable to meer Tyranny, and contrary to a solid and well-ballanced Government:) for such being the state of the Assyrian Monarchy, as all well read therein know, the Flatterers of these Kings possessed them with a belief, that the Authority of no Power even in mat∣ters of Religion, was to be acknowledged, nor even the Counsel of any Deity sought to, above or besides that of the King; for they did not build the reason of Obedience, upon the intrinsical verity of the thing commanded by the King, as those that press the same thing now would seem to do, or for shame pretend to do; but meerly upon the Will and Command of the Prince, whom they think ought not to be disobeyed, whatever he com∣manded, whose Will they would have to be the only rule of mens Actions in all things: Hence came the fury of Nebuchadnezzar against the Three Children, for not obeying him, Dan 3. in falling down before his Golden Image; and against Daniel, for praying with the Windows open towards Jerusalem; for neither of them are charged for doing any thing prejudicial to the State, and except in this, were found faithful Servants to the King in other things wherein they were imployed. And as none will readily justifie the Assyrian King in his doings, whereof himself greatly repented, so the Imployments he be∣stowed upon those and other Jews, and wherein they proved useful and faithful to him, doth sufficiently shew, that the distinct Interests of Religion and Policy under one Prince, may well be found without prejudice either to Prince or People. The like may be obser∣ved in the case of Ahasuerus, who was influenced by Haman to give out an Edict for the destruction of the Jews; the reason whereof urged by Haman was, that they had Laws different from the Kings Laws, and therefore it was not for the Kings profit to suffer them. I need not bestow pains to refute Haman's reason, since most men will con∣demn it. The same thing took place for the same cause in Nero, and the rest of the Emperors who persecuted the Christians; for the piety and ancient equity and sobriety of the Romans wearing out, and the corruption▪ degeneracy and effeminacy of the Eastern Nations pre∣vailing, so as the Emperors would be reputed and adored as Gods, thence came their en∣deavouring to oblige men to acknowledge no God but their Will and Pleasure, and no Religion but what depended thereon; thence they made Religion a necessary part of Go∣vernment. And thus I have briefly traced things until such time as Christianity came to be established by Law, and Christians came to be Magistrates. After that Christianity came to be received in the Courts of Princes, and that the Em∣perors became Christians, their honest zeal was soon abused by the corruption and co∣vetousness of the Clergy, who for their own ends first possess'd them with a belief that they ought to seek to settle and establish Christian Religion by their Force and Power, and that it did much contribute to their Spiritual advantage to bestow large Revenues upon the Clergy, and that as Supreme Magistrate he had a care and superintendency over the Church; in meddling with which the Emperor Constantine found himself quickly not a little embarassed, when he could not find a way to satisfie the Clergy, when they came to quarrel among themselves; and so each Party afterwards in the differences of these Times▪ as they could draw the Emperor to their side, made use of this Power of the Ma∣gistrate in matters of Religion, for the destroying each other: until at last by the grow∣ing of Superstition and other great shakings which hapned to the Roman Empire, the Pope instead of being subject to the Emperor▪ and appointed by him (which he was for several Centuries) made a shift to turn him by degrees out of Italy, establish to himself a Temporal Jurisdiction in Rome, as being forsooth Peters Patrimony, and at last not only to be independant from the Emperor, but superiour to him, as by the tract even of their own Historians is manifest, and known to all those who have read the story of Hildebrand and others. And thus by the like means several Bishops in Germany, and other places, abusing the zeal and ignorance of the people, came into the possession of great Temporal Juris∣dictions;
and not only so, but in all Nations of Europe they obtained a place in the Go∣vernment, and became a distinct State; by means of which, having an immediate depen∣dance upon the Pope, he came to exercise an Universal Monarchy in the Christian World: And thus Religion came to be a part of Civil Government among Christians. And it is greatly to be regretted, that in the Reformation this was not rooted out, but in a great measure retained not only by the Lutherans, but even by the Calvinists: So that although those who follow the Geneva Discipline, do pretend to abstract the Clergy from meddling in State, yet their method of proceeding proves at last the same; for while they lay an obligation upon the Magistrate, under pretence of taking care for the Cause and Church of Christ, to establish one sort of form of Religion, and ruine all others; wherein he must steer by the Clergies Compass, or otherwise have the people blown up unto a Sedition from the Pulpit: So that experience hath proved, that under the Government of Presbytery, (especially as it was improved in Scotland, where it came to its height) the insolency and imperiousness of the Clergy became no less troublesome and unsupportable to the Magistrates, then that of Bishops, whether Papal or Protestant; so that it is mani∣fest, the altering from one form to another, hath not cured these Nations of the mischiefs that therethrough has attended them, so long as that fundamental Error is entertained, of making Religion a part of the Civil Government. Now this brief Historical hint doth abundantly shew, how these Interests are distinct, and ought not be jumbled together: To which I shall add these brief Considerations. First, Because Religion and Policy, or Christianity and Magistracy, are two distinct things, have two different ends, and may be fully prosecuted without respect one to the other; the one is for the purifying and cleansing the Soul, and fitting it for a future state; the other is for the maintenance and preserving of Civil Society, in order to the outward conveniency and accommodation of men in this World. A Magistrate is a true and real Magistrate, though not a Christian; as well as a man is a true and real Christian, without being a Magistrate. Christianity, far less this or that form of it, doth not belong to the being of Magistracy; else the Apostles and Primitive Christians could not have acknow∣ledged the Heathens to have been their lawful Magistrates and Superiors, as they did, and taught their Disciples so to do, as appeared in the practice of the Primitive Christians beforementioned. Secondly, Christ says expresly, his Kingdom is not of this World; the thing he came for is a business distinct from the external Government of the World, and hath no ne∣cessary connexion thereto; and therefore there doth not appear any one saying of his or his Followers, to warrant Magistrates as such to meddle in Religion, or to warrant his Disciples and Followers as such to meddle with the outward Government of the Nations: And truly the dismal effects this has produced, both to the ruine of Christianity and Civil Government, may convince those that are not byassed by particular Interest, (as all Clergy∣men, both Pope, Prelate and Presbyter generally are) and love the good and advancement either of Christianity or Civil Government, that it is high time to avoid this snare. To this the state of the Jews is usually objected, whose Religion and Government was mixed together: But that saying of Christ abovementioned is thereunto a sufficient An∣swer, for they had an outward Kingdom, which Christ came not to establish, neither for himself nor Followers; and theirs related to a particular Race or Family, which is not the case now: besides that their outward Policy was by Revelation expresly given them of God, who gave them Rulers, Judges, Kings, oftentimes by the particular appointment of his Prophets, without respect either to hereditary Right, or the choice of the People; and unless we would plead for the like thing now, which none I know of do, I mean of those that strive for the Government, there can be nothing rationally urged from the state of the Jews in this matter. But some may be apt to say, that there is a necessity that Religion and Policy be inter∣laced, because those things are a part of Religion, which are of absolute necessity to Go∣vernment; such as the suppressing of Murther, Adultery, Theft, Perjury, which surely belongs to the Magistrates to punish. To this I answer, It is true it belongs to the Magi∣strate to punish such like crimes; but as these things are contrary to the Law of God, and such as Religion strikes against, so they are injurious to Civil Society, and tend to destroy it▪ and therefore come under the Magistrates cognizance in this respect, or under this re∣duplication, and not upon the meer Religious account; for whatever is destructive or in∣jurious to Civil Society, comes to be punished by the Magistrate upon that score, without respect to its concern in Christianity: as we see these things were punishable by the Ma∣gistrates in all well-regulated Kingdoms and Commonwealths among the Heathens; where
they could not be considered as any part of the Christian Religion. Not that I deny, where both Magistrate and People are Christian, and agreed in the acknowledgment that such things are not only hurtful to Civil Society, but destructive to their immortal Souls, he may improve that reason to deterr the people from these evils▪ as also to bear home to them the justice of the punishment: but this he does not simply as a Magistrate, but as a Christian, even as such Magistrates among the Heathens as were Philosophers some∣times used to do. To this I suppose it may be also readily objected; That according to this Principle both Papists, Presbyters, Anabaptists, yea such as were John of Lyden and his Complices, may and ought to be tolerated, if the Magistrate has nothing to do with the Consciences of his Subjects: And again, if the Magistrate should become any of these, the People ought quietly to bear it. To this I answer, and indeed herein the excellency of this fundamental Prin∣ciple both in Religion and Government will appear, That Popery hath two parts, the one is that which is meerly Religious, that is, which relates properly to Religion or Conscience, and are peculiar to them, such as the believing Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Adoration of Saints and Images, yea and the Superiority of the Bishop of Rome over other Church∣men, as they call them; all which, and those of this kind, may be believed and professed without prejudice to Civil Society, and as being matters meerly relating to Conscience, come not properly under the Magistrates cognizance. The other part is the opinion of the Pope's power over Princes and States, his absolving the people from their Obedience, his giving them Dispensations to kill and destroy them; and allowing them not to keep Faith to Hereticks, and such like; which as they are destructive to Government, are truly no part of Religion, but a politick contrivance long hatched by the Bishop of Rome and his Dependants, for establishing to himself a firm Monarchy in the World, and therefore ought to be guarded against and punished by the Magistrate, not as Errors in Religion, but as destructive to the Government. If it be said, all Papists believe and profess, and are ready to practise these things: To that I say, then in so far they are lyable and ought to be punished, and not tolerated. But let the reason of our procedure & sentence against them be, not their opinion in things meerly Religious, but their destructiveness to Civil Government: Thus if we go upon this sound Principle, we shall preserve the honour of the truly Christian & Pro∣testant Cause, and take away from them all occasion of glorying in their Sufferings, or of strengthning themselves against Protestants in Popish Countries, who live peaceably, and hold no such Principles as oblige them to make any disturbance in the Government. The like may be said of all others called Sectaries, whom the Magistrate is to restrain only in so far as they hold principles, or bring forth practices that are destructive to the Government. As to the second part of the objection, relating to the Magistrate, I answer, such are either Elective, or Hereditary; if Elective, there is no place for the objection, because the Electors have access to chuse men of such Principles as they like best; if Hereditary, it is either absolute, or limited; if there be any such exyress limitation, as excludes men of such and such Principles, then the case is solved; if not, the former distinction will hold: Let the Magistrate entertain such Principles as best likes him, in matters that are purely Religious; but if he will entertain such as are destructive to the Government, by which he infringes the priviledges of the people, and will rob them of their Lives, Liberties and Estates, meerly upon the account of Religion, certainly they have great reason to beware how they come under such a Yoak; which they can do without any blemish, and with full justification in the face of the Nations, since they deny not the Magistrate the exercise of his Religion for himself: and herein the people also may be sufficiently secured, whatever be the Mgistrates Religion, if thus bounded, as in the application to the state of things here in England, and Scotland also, will appear, to which I now proceed. It is to be considered, that these Nations having been long involved in a Civil War, through which a new people (not formerly, or but little known) have grown up, who as men have or ought to have an interest in the same Immunities, Freedoms and Priviledges with the rest; as to Civil things at least; for else in England the Papist might plead Magna Charta, that all but they ought to be extruded the Nation, or be lyable to such troubles as might make it too hot for them to stay in; and so in Scotland and Ireland, if not by the same, yet by other mediums: so that as to the Spiritual Constitution, or the Civil Govern∣ment of these Nations as to Spiritual things the Laws have not been as those of the Medes and Persians, but have received alterations according to the necessity and conve∣niency of times; that those who have given the Law, and in and for whose favour, for whose protection the Laws were expresly made, had them turned against them, and for the protection of those against whom the Laws were made.
Since the coming in of the King that now is, (after a long Civil intestine War, as hath been said) that which hath been set up paramount over and above all, hath been that of Bishops, or Episcopacy, to the utter suppression of all others; with all strenuous endeavours to strengthen and propagate that Profession, and drive on an Uniformity, which how in∣effectual it hath hitherto been, all may see, as may appear by the Kings Declaration in the year 1672. and though a considerable time hath since intervened, it may still be seen there was good reason for the import of that Declaration, whereby the Ship of these Nations hath been tossed and lyable to great hazards, through the tumultuating humours, surmises, discontents of the severals concerned, in being lyable to be out of the protection of the Law; so that upon these accounts, and the concurring circumstances that either have been, or might have bern artificially managed to blow the Coal; I say, considering the combu∣stible matter, it is to me matter of acknowledgment and admiration, that things have not run unto confusion long ere now: And truly my hope is, that God Almighty intends better things for these Nations, then that one size or sort of people should be set up in matters of Religion, to the utter ruinating and undoing of all others; or that thereby through the impatience of man, (to whom it is hard to bear to have his Spiritual and Civil Liberties snapt away at once) or through the artifice of them who upon other grounds of discontent, may make use of this to blow these Nations into a flame, which God forbid, my hope and desire is rather, that those in Authority may consider as Christians and pru∣dent men, how to land the Ship in a safe Harbour. First, how as Christians they are not concerned to meddle in this matter; that is, that Christianity lays no obligation upon the Magistrate to establish any form of the Christian Religion by Law, is above shewn: so that such do say nothing to the purpose, who land this debate (as most of the Clergy do) in re∣curring to the Laws in force, saying, So it stands by Law, so it is settled by Law, for the Law was no less strong in Q. Maries days for Popery, then now for that which is set up. Next, if it stand upon a meer prudent prudential politick foot, and so be settled by the Laws of these Nations, I apply my self in the second place to consider, how far it is truly suitable to prudence, how far it is prudential for the Magistrates of these Nations, how far it is good policy in them to own, assert, lay claim to such a power, as things are circumstantiated especially; that is to say, to set up by Law any form of Christian Religion, and by the Civil Power and Authority to stand by the Professors of it, to the depressing, extermina∣ting, discountenancing, crushing and discouraging of all others: I say, this seems to me not only to be Antichristian, but Antiprudential, Antipolitical, and a thing of a wonder∣ful dangerous consequence, and impracticable for any long continuance, without the hazarding of all, for these Reasons. It is not prudential for Magistrates to keep alive Seeds of discord, emulation, strife, among the people over whom they rule, for this but narrows his or their power, instead of en∣larging it; for as this engages those who are countenanced, so it alienates more or less all those who are discountenanced or is lyable to do so. Besides all the several other dissent∣ing Judgments in these Nations, there are three sorts that lay claim to the Magistrates espousing them and their way, as that which he is obliged to do in a National way; and all these three lay claim for the limits of their Church to be as broad and long at least as the Nation, to wit, the Popish, Prelatical, and Presbyterian; all these pretend to be diame∣trically opposite to each other, and each of them have had the advantage to get the Magi∣strate on their side, and to be settled by Law; publick places and publick maintenance have belonged to them: Thus even the Democratical Government of Presbytery, could cry out on all meddlers with Church-Lands, but especially Tithes, as Sacrilegious persons. Now this hath been especially the Bone of Contention among these three; it was not, nor is not meerly that any of them should be owned to be the Church and Ministry of Christ only, or before all others, but that they should be set above all others, so as to have the maintenance and respective priviledges due to Holy Church. Now were it prudential to set up any of these three, as the present condition and complexion of the Nations are? I say, Nay; as for the Papists, they are a diminutive Sect to the rest of the Nation re∣spectively, though upon all other accounts they stood upon an equal foot with the rest differing from them, as I have shewn before they do not: as to those of the Episcopal way, such as truly are engaged in their Judgments to that way, are not much more considerable then they, so that they will be found but a diminutive Sect also▪ so that to establish them, and drive a Conformity to them, hath been hitherto but to go against Wind and Tide, be∣cause the sence of the people (though upon differing accounts) hath been and is against them: as to the Presbyterians, it is to be confessed they are more considerable then both the other for number, though not of one Judgment among themselves, albeit all agreeing
that they ought to be set up, owned and countenanced by the Magistrate, and he to be sub∣servient to them, not to be the Head of the Church, that is lodged in the General Assem∣bly: yet in prudence it is not t, nor a foot large enough for the Magistrate to rest upon, so as to crush down all others; for they, taken as all of one Judgment, will be found but a di∣minutive Sect, put in the ballance with all others, to wit, the other two beforementioned, and the rest of the dissenters in the Nation. And as they are a people positive and peremp∣tory, and lyable to fall in differences among themselves, as was manifest in Scotland about the year 1650. it will be no less hard to satisfie them; then they to satisfie one another; how∣ever this will be the minimum quod sic, that all others must be crushed and born down, so as it will be found hard to please them, for they will be found to grow in their Encroachments and Demands, and it will not be found so easie a matter, whatever cause or occasion should be found for it, to limit or stop them once being set up as they that are less considerable: neither do I see it prudential for the Magistrate to countenance any of these, so as to give them the sole countenance of Publick Authority, as to Church-Power, as it hath been called and accounted the National Church, & so these to have Publick Authority and Maintenance, and Priviledge accordng to Law▪ & the rest only to be tolerated and connived at, for this is only to keep up the Bone of Contention, that as opportunity serves they in the Saddle may be unhorsed, and they that are stronger get into their room: For it is never to be reckoned of, that the Papists though they had their Liberty by way of toleration or connivance, as the rest of dissenters, will be satisfied so long as they see Law countenance them that sepa∣rated from them, and those in the possession of their Mass-houses and Maintenance, that were originally settled upon and consecrated by their Church, and which as to its original had its rise from their Church? Or is it to be reckoned upon that the Presbyters, what∣ever countenance or toleration were granted them, though settled by Law, would be satis∣fied while excluded from the Publick Places and Maintenance? and they being the stronger, and a growing Interest, would still be lying at catch to be in again; were it not then good Christianity in the Magistrates, who profess themselves to be Christians, to deny themselves in giving to Christ Jesus that which is his due only, that is, to be Head in and over his Church, and leave the Government to him, and get their hands out of this Thorny matter, that hath produced nothing to themselves but trouble, without which these Nations can never be firmly settled: I am bold to say, and were it not good prudence so to do. What hath been the Fama clamosa for many years of old, and of late before the War, and since the coming in of the King, and is so at this day? Popery! Arbitrary Government! there hath a Jea∣lousie entred the minds of people concerning these things; could a better way be found out to pluck up these surmises by the Roots, then if all concern'd would shew a willingness and ready compliance, and contribute to it in their respective places and stations, that it might be fundamentally settled and established as a Basis never to be shaken, that all Christian men should be left to the Government of the Law of Jesus, to worship him and serve him, as they shall find themselves by him obliged; the Magistrate not at all to meddle or inter∣meddle therein, further then to see that this be kept among all, so that no man nor men may be imposed upon in the matters of Religion, within the bounds of his Jurisdiction, by any outward force or violence; nor his Authority be made use of to confirm any Spiri∣tual sentence more or less, but as every one hath been or may be perswaded to joyn them∣selves to any sorts of people, upon a Spiritual or Christian account, they may be left so to do in matters meerly and only relating to Conscience, and that all Laws to the contrary may be utterly and totally abolished; and as to all other things, every one from the least to the greatest to be subject to the Civil Laws of the Nation, and that Order and Good Go∣vernment among men may be established, and that none under whatsoever pretence may plead Immunity from subjection to the Laws, in such things that come properly and un∣questionably under the Civil Magistrates cognizance; so that he may be an encouragment to those that do well, and a terror to evil doers, that good and wholesom Laws may be made by those to whom it is proper so to do, for establishing the Rights and Properties of men as men, and for encouraging Sobriety; and this is proper for the Magistrate. But what will become of Holy Church, will some say? She will be where she was, for the Magistrate withdrawing his hand, leaving every profession and way to stand upon its own legs, Unchurches neither Papists, Episcopalians, nor Presbyterians, they are a Church still, if they were so before. But saith the Bishops and Hierarchy, What shall become of us? if the Magistrate withdraw his hand, where shall we have Maintenance? where shall we have a place to Preach in? Ye shall have no less advantage or ground to stand in then those that relate to other people, that account themselves to have Ministers, and to be Churches; yea this advantage you have above all them, that you have had 18 or 19 years Places and
Benefices, so you may the better hear the want, till you try the benevolence of your People, which is all the rest will have as well as you, so you will all stand on an equal foot; and it's fit they should▪ for the publick Preaching places, and the publick Maintenance hath been the Bone of Contention in these Nations, and will be found to stand upon the same foot with Abbeys and Nunneries, and Church-Lands: The intent originally was honest and good, and from al. As the one  time of Reformation; and for publick necessity and conveniency, was removed and utterly abolished; as to the use they were first intended for; so may these, and so must these, if ever the Nation see a firm and thorough settlement; the Church-Lands (a suitable case given to the Tenants) applied to the Revenue of the Crown, and annexed thereto for ever inviolably; I mean Bishop, Chapte, and Dean-Lands, and such as have been accounted in the right and possession of the present Churches respectively. The Tithes have been a great oppression upon the people of these Nations▪ and would be absolutely ex∣tinguish'd both as to name and thing, so as there may be no footsteps of them; and that no man whatsoever that is a Proprietor in Land, may be lyable to have another to have an Interest in his Tithe, which hath been a great bondage and servitude; and had its Interest upon the account that they belong'd to Holy Church, and was their Patrimony. Now things being settled upon another foundation and turned quite in another Channel, by the pru∣dence and care of those to whom it begs properly so to do, with a suitable regard every way, that the cnscientiously tender Christian, ho ha suffered daily upon this account, and the Rights of men, as men, may be answered, and  way and expedient found out to give some competent satisfaction, suitable to the Rights and Possessions of Impropriators, so as henceforward the Stock and Tithe may b so confounded and involved, that whoever hath the Property of Possession of Lands, may never be lyable to any such bondage more or less, by these accessions of the Bishops; and other Church-Lands not already disposed o into the possession of the Laity, so called, there shall be a considerable addition of Revenue to the Crown, and hereby the Body of e people of those Nations will be gratified, in removing the great oppression and servitude of Tithes, the cause of Contention will be removed, and every sort and size of people will stand upon their own legs; all unreasonable expectations of setting up one sort of men, and throwing down all the rest, will be out; all fears and jealousies, and animosities upon this account will cease, and hereby that which hath been a standing fear and jealousie upon the people of these Nations, will be plucked up by the Roots. If it be said, What shall become of the Magistrate or Magistrates, things being thus set∣tled? Where were the hazard? for were it not unreasonable that the Magistrate or Magi∣strates should be in worse case then the People? who are to be left to their absolute liberty as to the matter of Religion, without being lyable to any Civil inconveniency, or abridg'd of any priviledge upon the account of this or that form of Religion, meerly as such; then why not the Magistrate? It being fundamentally settled, as it would be, and is needful it should be, that except in his or their Family as Chapain, and that in a temporary way, it should not be in the power of the Magistrate or Magistrates, to make any standing Mainte∣nance, or settlement upon any sort of men in Orders, or to set them up or countenance them, further then by his or their being of their perswasion, or allowing them on such ac∣count entertainment as Chaplain; and that for clearing the people of these Nations of the aforementioned Seeds of Jealousie, it be fundamentally settled as a Magna Charta for ever, that whosoever in the Magistracy, or any other from the least to the greatest, shall be found to alter or innovate this Fundamental settlement, shall be lyable to be judged by this Law, as guilty of Treson against the Fundamentals of the Government, for the Law only is, and is to be declared Supreme; and that whoever either separately or in conjunction, shall go against this Basis or Fundamental settlement, were it a single person, or the Parliament, shall ceas to be Magistrate or a Parliament, and their Decrees become void and null: for the ndametals are never to be altered, viz. that the Magistrate, as Magistrate, is to be wholly▪ shu but, as to all meddling in matters of Religion, but every man as to the Magi∣strates interposition ▪ be left free; and that all men, as men born freemen, not ha∣ving fofied their Liberty by doing those things which makes them obnoxious, shall be secure in their Persons and dates from all. Arbitrary proceedings; which will truly be for the hour and greatnss of the Magistrate or Magistrates, and safety of the People. These things being writ by one that hates to be Dogmatical, are therefore only modestly propo∣sed and humbly submitted to those of more mature Judgment and greater Experience, especially to the New approching Parliament, by him who in truth can subscribe himself, Philo-Britannicus.
