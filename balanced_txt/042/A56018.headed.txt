A PROPOSAL FOR THE Sinking of several DEFICIENCES; BY RAISING Three Millions of Money, at the Rate of 10 l per Cent. per Annum, for One Life, or Lease of Thirty Years, which of them shall first Expire. Most Humbly Offered to the Consideration of the Honourable the HOUSE of COMMONS. THAT there be given out, by his Majesty's Commissioners, to any Persons, Natives or Foreigners, Fifteen hundred Thousand Tickets, at Forty Shillings a Ticket, which will raise Three Millions: And it is humbly hoped, the Ad∣venturers may satisfie the Purchase Money with Malt Tickets, Salt Tallies, Births and Burials, Transport Debt, &c. THAT a Fund of Three hundred Thousand Pounds per Annum, for Thirty Years, be vested in his Majesty, &c. to Pay the following Be∣nefits, viz. 1 —of 1000 pounds a year 1000 1 —of 900 pounds a year 900 1 —of 800 pounds a year 800 1 —of 700 pounds a year 700 2 each of 600 pounds a year 1200 4 each of 500 pounds a year 2000 5 each of 400 pounds a year 2000 6 each of 300 pounds a year 1800 10 each of 200 pounds a year 2000 50 each of 100 pounds a year 5000 100 each of 70 pounds a year 7000 200 each of 60 pounds a year 12000 300 each of 50 pounds a year 15000 400 each of 40 pounds a year 16000 500 each of 35 pounds a year 17500 600 each of 30 pounds a year 18000 700 each of 25 pounds a year 17500 800 each of 20 pounds a year 16000 900 each of 15 pounds a year 13500 1000 each of 10 pounds a year 10000 28000 each of 5 pounds a year 140000 33581     To the first Ticket drawn besides the Benefit may come up with it, the yearly Sum of— 100   300000 l a year.
THE said Benefits to be held by Life, or Lease of Thirty Years, which of them shall first Expire. A Benefit Ticket of or under 70 l per Annum, to have but one Life nominated for it. A Benefit Ticket of or above 100 l per Annum (at the Request of the Owner) may be divided into as many parts as there are of 50 l included in it, and every 50 l per Annum may have a Life nominated for it. As many Benefit Tickets as the Proprietors thereof will, may be held by one and the same Life: The Lives to be named within 60 days after the Drawing. ALL Tallies (given out at the Exchequer in Lieu of Benefitted Ticket or Tickets) importing the value of 15 l per Annum, to be paid by half Yearly: The rest (if any such be; for it is concluded there will be Buy∣ing or Selling of small Prizes, so that scarce any body will be concerned less, one way or other, than for 15 l per Annum) by Yearly Payments: The first Payment to be reckon'd from Lady-Day, 1701. THE time given for taken out Tickets may be until the 10th Day of February, 1700. and at the following Rates, viz. FOR every Ticket taken out before the 1st of November, Forty Shillings. FOR every Ticket after the 1st of November, and before the 1st of January, Forty Two Shillings. FOR every Ticket after the 1st of January, Forty Four Shillings. AND as a farther Encouragement to be early Adventurers, if Three Millions be raised by the 10th of February, then there may be a Rebate of Two Shillings on every Ticket taken out before the 10th of July, 1700. to be allowed at the Exchequer to the Bearer of such Tickets after the Drawing shall be ended. IF the Million Lottery way of Drawing shall be thought inconvenient by reason of the great Number of Tickets, then the following Method may be used. LET the Tickets be made up in Books, each Book to contain 500 Tickets, and the Books numbred from 1 to 3000. LET 3000 pieces of Paper numbred from 1 to 3000, stand for the said Books, be rolled up, put into a Box mark'd with the Letter [A,] and there well mix'd, and 200 of them, nor more nor less, drawn out, one after another, and let the Tickets of the 200 Books answering and bearing the same Numbers of the 200 Papers that shall happen to be drawn as aforesaid, and none other, be cut-out, rolled up, and put into a Box mark'd with the Letter [B,] and drawn against 33581 Benefits, and 66419 Blanks-from a Box mark'd with the Letter [C,] and let the chance of those Tickets determine the matter. A Book for taking Subscriptions is now open at  and every one that will Subscribe, first must pay Forty Shillings to the Bank of England, as a Pledge for performing of his or her Subscription: The said Sum of Forty Shillings to be returned in either of these cases, viz. If the Sub∣scriber shall perform his or her Subscription, or if this Proposal shall not pass into an Act: But if it be Enacted, then the said Forty Shillings of every Subscriber, not complying with his or her Subscription, shall be forfeited to His Majesty: And it is humbly hoped, That the Liberty of taking out Tickets, may be only in the Subscribers until the 10th Day of April, 1700.
Some REASONS offered for the Granting of the said Proposal. IT will be Useful in General; for, I. as voluntary Contributions always have been esteem'd the most Easie and Advantageous Way of raising of Money, by means whereof the People are more strongly Cemented together, so the Funds which are given for them, being gene∣rally for a Term of Years, the gentle Influences of them will be less felt in a long tract of Time, and by a new Generation of Men, than present Aids and Supplies by such as have lived in the full heat of Taxes, decay of Trade, and other Notorious Losses. II. IT asks a Term of Years for a Fund far short of what has been granted to Annuities of the like Nature; To wit, those of One, Two, and Three Lives; and those for Survivorship. III. IT will gratifie the Commonalty of England, who have not had any thing as yet set so low as to be in their reach, they could not med∣dle with the Annuities, scarce with the Million Lottery, the one requi∣ring an Hundred Pounds, and the other Ten Pounds a Ticket. IV. IT will be serviceable to such as desire a certainty during Life, or would make Provision for a Wife, or Child, or Friend. V. IT may be useful in Sinking of Exchequer Bills, and Paying off Parliamentary Debts at a Rate as easie to the Publick as can be imagined. VI. IT may save a great Sum of Money which has usually been given for Rebate in the like Cases, at least it will save something in pro∣longing the time of Payment of it, for the Rebate herein proposed is not to be made till after the Drawing. VII. IT cannot be less inviting to Adventurers than the Million Lottery was, and perhaps may fill as soon; however, by a Clause the Fund as well as the Prizes may be made to bear Proportion to the Sum which shall be advanced: That there is no Allowance for the Blanks, it ought not to be an Objection, for the Prizes are thereby much en∣larged: Besides, when Allowances have been made for them, as in the late Lotteries, they have been valued and sold at more than Forty Shillings Loss per Ticket, and this has not happen'd from the Altera∣tion of the Coin, or any other Accident; for it may be remembred that before the Drawing of the Million Lottery, the usual and common Rates given for the Chance of a Ticket were Three Guineas, and if it proved a Blank, the Contributor was to keep it, if a Prize, the Adven∣turer was to have it paying 7 l more to the Contributor, which is a plain Demonstration, that the Adventurers rather had had the Tickets set at Forty Shillings a Ticket, without any Provision for Blanks than at 10 l per Ticket, with the Provision made for them. Lastly, The Share or Shares of the Nominee or Nominees that shall happen to Die, may go to The Improvement of small Parsonages, Green-wich-Hospital, Chelsea-Colledge, Rebuilding of Whitehall; Or towards the Endowment of Work-Houses raised, or to be raised by Act of Parliament for the Maintenance of the POOR.
Another way of Raising Three Millions. LET Sixty Thousand Tickets be given out, at Fifty Pounds a Ticket, and the Fund One hundred and eighty Thousand Pounds per An∣num for Fifty Years, payable in the following manner, viz. To the said 60000 Tickets, whether Blanks or Prizes, each One Pound per Annum for 50 Years certain to the Contributors, their Exe∣cutors, Administrators and Assigns. 60000 l per Annum. To 12696 Tickets (part of the said Sixty Thousand Tickets) Benefitted for Life, or Fifty Years, which of them shall first Expire, One hundred and twenty thousand Pounds per Annum: The Benefitted Shares of the Fortu∣nate Adventures, whose Nominees shall hap∣pen to Die, to be equally divided among the Survivors of them, unless there shall be but 40 Nominees living, after which time no fur∣ther Advantage of Survivorship to be had; as it is in a late Act for Annuities with Survi∣vorship. 120000 l per Annum.   Total 180000 l per Annum. The said 12696 Fortunate Tickets to be, viz. 1 —of 1000 Pounds a Year 1000 2 each of 900 Pounds a Year 1800 3 each of 800 Pounds a Year 2400 4 each of 700 Pounds a Year 2800 5 each of 600 Pounds a Year 3000 6 each of 500 Pounds a Year 3000 7 each of 400 Pounds a Year 2800 8 each of 300 Pounds a Year 2400 50 each of 200 Pounds a Year 10000 150 each of 100 Pounds a Year 15000 300 each of 50 Pounds a Year 15000 12160 each of 5 Pounds a Year 60800 12696   120000 FINIS.
