Ca. Primo. of the nature of man. THe creatour that hathe created all thinge of nought our sauiour & maister cryste that is lorde almighty hathe made vpon the .vi. day our fore fader Adam in the felde of damasc of of red erthe / & there he gaue vnto him bothe lyfe & owle where thrugh he is becom man & figured lyke vnto the sy¦mylitude of almyghty god / and than made hym lorde of all erthly thinges / and gaue hym grace thrugh his glo∣rious godhede & shaped in hym suche wyt & sapience that there was neuer erthly man that had the cōninge that he had / And than dyd Adam geue vn∣to euery thynge that is vnder heuen his perfyte name.

Also god hath made ye planetes and sterres of the fyer / the wyndes & fowles of ye ayre / ye fysshes of the water. and man of erthe / wher¦fore whan man beholdeth ye thynges made of the water than shall he fynde hymselfe very symple / but whāne he beholdeth yt that is made of the ayre thā shall he fynde hymselfe moche mo¦re sympler / yett whan he beholdith yt that god hath made of the fyre / thā is the most symplest of al / and man shall nat lyke hymselfe to heuēly thynges no accept hymself better thā an erth¦ly thynge / for that he fyndeth and the bestis also / and this is to be vnderstād of ye bodi of man / which body was first named Adam / whāne that our lorde  ∣ous godhed / he gaue vnto hym incon∣tynent a cōuenyent and perfyte rule & lawe whiche he sholde holde & kepe / and this it was. That he in all though¦tes / wordes / and workes / neuer sholde thinke or wisshe of any other worse in no maner of wyse than he wolde that of hym sholde fortune / Than sholde he kepe the way of rightwisnes and ega∣lite.

Exemplū whan he saide Cresite / waxe and mul¦tiply through thencreasinge of ye sede And thus he hathe created man & wo¦man because they sholde bringe forth of their sede / which sede is named sper¦ma / and is a profitable parte of ye fode cōmynge after the first disiestyon / and that sperma is apoynted to frutefull vessell is to the entent that our huma∣nite sholde contynewe the lenger and nat ende / But he that soweth tomo∣che of this sede / that is to vnderstande they that occupy tomoche with womē they wex sone feble of lȳmes / and dye within shorte space / Wherfore Galie¦nus saith he that is gelded may lyue a lōge season / and men that haue but lytell conuersacyon with womē may lyue longer than women / for they be hoter of nature. ¶Here after foloweth the. te ages of mankynde lykened be ye ten dyuers bestis as here is ex¦presly shewed / and how the n¦ture of mankynde dothe chaū¦ge from ten yere dethe cōme tyme of eth hī as a gose yt i¦to lucke ye frēdes  it he in erthe is
Sāctus Augustin{us}. vpon thesame that before is spe¦cifyed of the makyng of man in his moders wombe. AVgustinus saith of the making of mānes body / whan that sper∣a is receyued in the dewe place of ye oders body / than is that sede formed efome or mylke in ye first .vi. daeys  in thre dayes folowīge it maketh reparacyn of the lyfe in forme of ly¦pympels or bladders. Sixe dayes r that it chaūgeth holy into blode d .xij. dayes after that it is tourned o flesshe. Nyne dayes after that / ye  is deuyded from the sholders and rmoste lȳmes of the body / as ye sy∣ the bely / tyll that it hathe his ful ely shape of body & lȳmes. withī es afte that is sene a full pro∣ body / yet the prīcypall lym¦mes be made first / as the harte / the ly∣uer & braynes / & than the lȳmes that therto belōgeth / as the nauyl / ye mawe & the codes / and after that suche as be nexte / but last of al be handes and fete made with the other lȳmes. And the bodij of man is made of many diuers sortes of lȳmes / as senewes / vaynes / fatte / flesshe & skynne. And also of the foure moistours / as sanguyne / flema∣tyke / coleryke / & melancoly. But all creatures hathe a sesonable tyme of ye yere to bringe forthe their frute saue only mankynde whiche is at the leste of body full made in his moders wōbe the .xxxv. daye. & entreth the mouyn∣ges of his body vpon the .lxx. daye and that birthe is in the seuenth moneth.  daye than the chylde geteth  the .lxxx. daye / & that birth is vpon the eight moneth & they dye oftentymes. Yf the body be full made vpon the .xlv daye / than receyueth it lyfe vpon the xc. daye and is borne vpon the nynth moneth. But the body of mankynde is cōmonly full made vpon the .xlv. daye as before is specifyed. &c̄. and that is the moste connenyent tyme. And whan mankynde is borne / than he retoureth to the erthe ageyn of the which he was before created & made. ¶Of the disgestion of mete wherby the body is sustay∣ned.
THe lyf of man is prī¦cypally sett in humi¦do radicali / that is in ye ra¦dicall moistour for whan man lacketh yt / than must he dye / and because ye na / turall here is also in man the whyche here whan it fideth nothīge ellys to be sustayned of / thā it sustay¦neth hym self of radycall moystour / & because thys moystour sholde nat be fe¦bled but kept in good ma¦ner / therfore ye nature ha / the ordayned mete to bee eten / and yt to be broughte to disiestyon / for whā it is thawed wt the tehe  than  & ther is ye fyrste disiestion & there ye is ertly deuided frome ye clene & ye onclene is sente downe to ye funda¦ment & is voided through the place of purgacion / & ye clene humour is sent to ye lyuer why / che is ye secōde disiestiō / & there is ye wa¦tery onclennes deuyded from ye clene & sent down to ye bladder & thā voided at ye watery place / & ye clene is sent to ye hart & yt is the thyrde dysiestyon. and there is agayne the onclene sent or de¦uided frome the clene / and of the oncle¦ne cometh the seed sperma in ye man and the menstruum in the women / & the clene become blod / and that is sent thorough grete waynes to all the pla¦ces of the body / and that is agayne de¦uyded the clene from the onclene / an the onclene gothe away through the swete and swete holes / and is chaun / ged in to the nayles / and suche lyke / & the clene changeth hymselfe into the substaūce of hym that eteth the mete And thus is the naturall restored and strengthened yf that they waste nat ye radicall moystour wherin the lyfe is layde. yf the radicall moystour be my¦nished / than it is agayn into the other as before is testefyed. &c.
¶Howe that man cōmeth into the howse of dethe. Colerius. ¶The howse of dethe. Flegmaticus Sanguineus Melancolicus HOw that man cōmeth vnto the howse of deth ye shall vnderstande be thre maner of wayes And first be the foure elemētis wherof man is made / for the foure elementis fight togeder / and the one ouercōmeth the other and than must man dye. yf Adam had nat synned the four elementis sholde neuer haue varyed / and Adam sholde haue had full power to haue accorded and rule them. The seconde / man dyeth because that hu∣midum radicale forsaketh hym / that is the naturall moystour. yf Adam had nat synned
god had set vs the ire of lyfe / & we sholde haue ben fre of all sekenesses / & moyst of nature & neuer dyed / but bydden euer lusty & fresshe as a yonge man. The thirde man dyeth of that he hath ben hurt wt wepens wtin or wtout or wt burdens lifting or bytinges of bestis. &c. If Adam had nat sinned all thynge sholde haue bene to him obediēt & nothinge to him cōtrary. & these thre maners of dethes be cōtained in the four cōplexcions of man / as in the sāguyne / colerike / flematike / & melācoly The sanguyne waxeth oftētymes so old through gode gouernaūce / that he must occopy spectacles & liue longe or hūmidū radicale departe frome him / but than he dyeth. The colerike cōmeth oftentymes do dethe be accidētall maner through his hastines for he is of nature hote & drye. The flematike cōmeth often to dethe tho¦rough great excesse of mete & drinke or other gret labours doinge / for his nature is colde and moyste & can not well disiest. And melācoly is heuy / full of care & heuy¦nes / wherof he engendereth moche euyll blode that causeth great sekenes which bringeth him vnto dethe. Thus go we al vnto the howse of dethe / the one thrugh ensuynge of his cōplexcion / the other through the ordenances of almyghty god. The thirde through the planetis & signes of the firmamēt.
¶Here after ensueth the perfyte knowlege of the x. wittes / & in what place of the hede that they lay / that is to vnderstāde the v. interyall wittes / & the fyue wit¦tes cōmune as it stādeth in the figure of the hede.

And mankynde bereth his hede vpright towardes the heuens kyng∣dome to thētente that he shold optayn the ryches & gyftes of grace that God hathe ordayned in him / whiche be his naturall wittes / & they be x. in nōber and first there be fyue intery al wittes as these. ¶Fantasye that layth before a hye in the hede.

The melancoly saithe that he hathe sene fowle thynges & fer¦ formes o lykenesses offendes & yt fortuneth often whan the body is trou¦bled or meued with medicynes or ba¦thes. The colericke dremeth of fyre / of water / of manslaghter. &c. The flema¦tike dremeth often that he sitteth in the water or in the snowe / o that he eteth honye / or suche other lyke of moystnes whiche causeth oftentymes swete fle¦mis to fal vpon their tonges. The san¦guyne dremeth often tymes through ouermoche influēce of blode that he se¦eth spretes as the fayres obyn gode felowe or suche lyke. &c.

Many one dremeth lainge in his bed that he standeth vpryght and pysseth against a wall / as the yonge childeren do yt dreme of their playe done be daye in the strete. Somtyme nature labou¦reth so sore in the slepe for to purifye ye kydne is that the sleper dremeth of le∣chery & concupiscens of the flesshe / as kyssinge / helsinge / & on lawfull hande∣lynge / whiche is very inordinate. ¶The operation of mankynde. ¶Auicenna saith that fastinge specyll kylleth the scorpyon / & temper camfer with spetyll & that kylleth the itche na∣med Impedigo if it rubbed vpon it.
