REASONS Humbly Offered, For Setling a Yearly Incom from Hackny-Coachmen, and by a Duty on Coals, towards the Relief of the ORPHANS of the City of London. AS to the Yearly Incom from Hackny-Coachmen, It is humbly Offered, That they should be under the Government and Regulation of the City of London, and Pay to the City towards Relief of the ORPHANS. The City of London hath Time out of mind made By-Laws for regulating Disorders and Annoy∣ances within the said City and its Liberties; And on this account did very Anciently limit the Numbers of Carrs to be used in London-Streets, and give them Licenses yearly, (which hath been often Allowed in Westminster-Hall); And likewise the Common Council of London did of Later years, after the Expiration of the Act of Parliament touching Hackny-Coaches (by Advice of Learned Council) make an Act to prevent Nusances in the Streets, and to the Inhabitants of the City and Damage of Trade by the multitude of Hackny Coaches, Restraining them to a Number and regulating their Standings. By the former Act of Parliament for Licensing of Hackny Coaches, 13 & 14 Car. 2. the Rent of Hackny Coaches was Appointed for Enlarging several Streets, as well in London as Westminster; And altho' there was raised thereby 34000 l. it was all applied to Westminster, except 1000 or 1500 l. for Rebuilding Temple Bar; which was as well for the Convenience of Westminster, as London, being the common Boundary and Passage of them both: So that to give London an equal Advantage (the Streets whereof are as much at least used and broken by Hackny Coaches, as Westminster); It is humbly desired, That London may now have the Benefit of that Revenue (as Westminster had it before) towards the Relief of so many Distressed Orphans. The Loss is exceedingly Great the City of London sustained by the Dreadful FIRE in Anno 1666, considering their Houses burnt down, a vast quantity of Goods and Merchandizes destroyed, the great Charge of Rebuilding, the Interruption of their Trade, and the Carrying it in great measure out of the City; Whereby the Losses and Calamity that befel London, have been a very great Gain and Advantage to Westminster and the adjacent Parts in Middlesex, in the Improvement and Increase of their Rents and Trade. The City of London is Charged in all Taxes much higher than Middlesex and Westminster, and had pressed for a considerable Abatement in the last Aid, had it not been for Retarding the Act; And that they were in hopes of the Parliaments further Assistance, in enabling them to Pay their Orphans.
The City of London provides Sheriffs for the County of Middlesex, and excuseth the Gentlemen of the County from that Charge, Maintains the County Gaol for Middlesex and Westminster, and is at the sole Charge of Keeping all Sessions for Gaol-Delivery for all their Felons. London also Contributes towards Supporting the Poor of divers Parishes, in Middlesex In Reference to the Coal-Revenue desired, It was concluded by former Parliaments, to be the most Equal and Indifferent way of Raising Mony for Building the Churches, and other like Publick Uses in London; And it is humbly hoped, This Parliament will bestow it now upon the City, for Relief of Their Orphans: The Burthen whereof will not be great, and will lye principally on London and the Parts adjacent, who make no small Advantage by their Neighbourhood to London, and may well (for that and other Reasons before mention'd) contribute so small a Part towards Relief of the Orphans; And even those Parts without the City of London, are Inhabited by great Numbers of its Citizens. The Government of the City of London (unless delivered from the Pressure of this Great Debt) cannot long subsist; And it may be considered, That the City is useful and serviceable to the Nation in divers respects, particularly by the Great Sums raised Yearly to the Crown by its Trade; the Cities supplying Mony by Loans on all publick Emergences; and the great Part it bears of the Kingdoms Tax: And it may be for the Honour of the Nation, That the Government of its Capital City should be Maintained, and Assistance given them for Discharging a DEBT (wherein so many Poor Persons are concerned) Contracted only by the many great and unavoidable Calamities that have befallen the City, and by Payment of Interest from time to time: And not (as hath been suggested) by the present Government of the City, or in Extravagant Expences to Maintain the Mayor and Sheriffs, who Serve the Government at their own great Expence; And some of them have had their Estates greatly exhausted thereby.
