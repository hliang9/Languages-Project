THE ULTIMUM VALE OF John Carleton, OF The MIDDLE TEMPLE LONDON, Gent. BEING A true Description of the Passages of that Grand Impostor, Late a Pretended Germane—Lady. Sta, Lege, Plora. Published by the Order and appointment of the aforesaid right wor∣thy and ingenious Author Mr. John Carleton. LONDON, Printed for J. Jones, 1663.
The Epistle to the Reader. Curteous Gentlemen and Ladyes, THink it not strange, if you perceive an alteration in me, from my usual method of prejudicary and modest expressions, both in my speaking and writeing. And though perhaps you may find more passion, so you shall find more cause for it; and as much reason and truth, nay more of the truth then ever yet I have published; which because it hath been absconded and hid, from those that are real Lo∣vers of it, and owe allegiance and supremacy to it, and have earnestly desired to know it, and I my self bound by the same Allegiance to declare it; though in the mid'st of trouble, yet to prevent farther trouble, I thought good to trouble my self once for all, that all and each single inquirer might not trouble me once. For this cause I say, be∣cause the truth it self hath been Clonded by such thick Mists of some persons Imaginations, others Narrations, other wilful Additions, other Jealousies, others Suppositions, others Suspitions, others Inqui∣sitions; some being malitious, others captious, others Censorious, others parasitical, others mercenary, others biased by hopeing to ob∣taine a self interest in her, or procure a satisfaction of their Lustful desires of her, who is the cause of these reports. Others missed by a soft and Candid Nature and easie Beleife, being won thereto by her Charmeing tongue and Sycophantick stile: some wilfully blind, others blind, yet wilful I say the truth, being glossed over and darkned by such varietyes of dispositions, multitudes of Errors and forged (though beleived) falsities hath made and justly to, the humour of passion most prediminant, and my soul restless till the truth be known. And though, there is no one so unfit to write as my self at this time, so there is none more fit to write the truth of some part of this then my self. I should have thought my self in Paradise had I not had this last occasion to write (which was the Judgment of Iudges that I should have a Wife; a Iudgment indeed to me) so I think my self in Purgatory that I have so sad a subject to write on; but I esteem my self most miserable, when I foresee how little my writing will doe me good in removing the cause, of which sad effects might follow, did not my faith bridle my passion, and tell me my Maker hath a great work in hand for me to do, otherwise I should with St. Paul, not only
desire to be dissolved, but ere this might had exceeded that desire, and dissolved my self; but a mighty hand of Providence hath, and doth guide and protect me, and leads me to holy David in his afflictions, where he saith, It was good for him he was so. As yet my affliction seems so great, that though I possess a being, I enjoy it not: and my very Soul serves for no other end, but to make me sensible of my sor∣row, and him that sent it, and her that caused it. That you could but Sympathize with me a while! or but see how grief like sparkes in Embers lay shrowded in my breast, which must flame out, least it con∣sume me. Strangulat inclusus dolor, Had you but seen me when I wrote this, how the motions of my mind and of my body were so alike, that there was no resting place for either. That you could but re∣sent and read thus far as I wrote it, where every word Tulit punct∣um—bears a full stop. There is no Physick, no Grave, no Charm, that can content and cast the molestntion of my working Soul into a dead sleep. They that never knew the happiness of setled thoughts, and a privat, studious, free, contemplative Life, think Troubles but Pastimes. But as it is a maxime in Law, Unumquodque dissolvi∣tur eo modo quo colligatur. So thus I will apply it,—That as a mighty hand hath brought me into trouble: so the same hand is as mighty still to lead me out, and here I cast Anchor: I am some∣thing better satisfied when I consider this true saying, Estque pati paenam quam meruisse minus. That is, It is less to suffer a punishment then to deserve it. Afflictions here in this Terrestial Globe are but the appurtenan∣ces that belong to our Inheritance, which all of us hold in Fee-simple: Or like bitter Pills prescribed and sent to us by the Great and wise Physician of Heaven and Earth, to purge us from the dangerous Di∣sease of security. No one is exempted from his Grosse be it light or heavy, Quisque suos patimur manes, I am not single yet. . He is happy to whom no ill happens. But I will not be to prolixe here Cutteous Reader) nor entertain your expectation too long, before I draw up this Curtaine, to let your eyes be satiated with the true Idaea of this Out-landish Canterbury-Monster,
One part of whose various actions at some persons entrea∣ties, and for the satisfaction of all inquisitive Spectators, I shall here∣after set forth. My present discomposedness makes me fearful least I may commit many Errors; If so, I am apt to beleive I may be excused, and I hope every judicious person will impute it to the ignorance of the Error, not an error of ignorance. I shall not relate every circumstance; for I should give both, you and my self too much trouble; but as I affect brevity, so I greatly respect verity; and as I intend to relate nothing but truth, so I will relate so much of it as may be material, to let you see her designe; and every ingeni∣ous Reader may suppose what additions she made, and how politick∣ly she enlarged her self in every action, and when the real truth is known to all (which is already to some scores in and about the City of London) I say, though it will not cure my Malady, it will ease my mind; and though many may and do desire to hide, yet they cannot detract from verity. I heartily wish there were fewer writings and more truths; and though I do not endeavour to force and extract a beleife from any, who have not been acquainted with the truth, nor my self, yet (to what I shall relate of my own knowledge after my ac∣quaintance with her) the greatest attestation that a Christian can make, I will at the desire of any person that scruples at the truth of my relation, and in the face of the whole Church of England will sa∣lute the Holy Bible, and will attest by that Almighty Power that made me with Reverence to the Oath. I think now I have bound my self strictly, and if this will not be sufficient security to any, then believe what you please; I shall but doe what my Allegiance to veri∣ty commands me, And so with Christian prayers for, and well wishes to you all, I take my leave, presuming to subscribe my self still. Idem qui pridem, Your Freind IOHN CARLETON. Septimo Julij, 1663. A Cognito Loco Incognito.
A true Description of the Passages of that Grand Impostor, late a pretended GERMANE-LADY. TO begin the Story of my first acquaintance with the late pretended Germane Lady, by name Henri∣etta Maria de Wolway, the name I first knew her by, alias, Mary Modders, daughter of William Modders late of Canterbury Musician deceased, alias Mary Steadman, alias Mary Vaughan, alias Madam Day, alias Madam Gorge, alias Mary Fixch, alias &c. I refer you to a late printed sheet of mine, termed my Replication, which if you repair to, you may see the Original thereof; But least it be not met with by all, and every person that shall read or hear this Book, I shall speak briefly of it again in the ensuing relation: And I will bring her now from Graves-end to the Sessions-house. About a Month before last Easter, this Canterbury Walloon came in a Gravesend Barge to Billingsgate, and amongst other company she came up with a Parson (for so his habit spake him) that sat near her, became acquainted with her, or she with him; and as she rela∣ted to me, (for now Gentlemen I speak but at second hand, yet still I keep to my first Assertion, to write the truth, though it be of ano∣thers relation, and this was hers to me and many others, since my acquaintance) The Gentleman began to be familiar and sportingly to offer some uncivillity to her unblemished Honour; as she ter∣med it, for which presumption, she seemed much to check him. It being early on a Tuesday morning when they landed, they went in∣to a house at Billinsgate, that waites for the Custom of Passengers that come up with the morning Tide, to repose themselves. The Parson offered to salute her, whom with great anger she denyed, telling him, That she was never kissed by any man yet, and that in her Country, If any man, especially a Priest, should be seen to speak
to, much more to salute a Gentlewoman, he might be sure of a sta. And for this misbehaviour of his, she said, she conferred the Title of Bawdy Priest on him. He out of his respects to her, I suppose, as a stranger, still offered his service to wait on her to finde a lodging, and would not be denyed: so between 5 and 6 of the clock, they walked along the City, and assaulted many Tavern doores for ad∣mittance, but finding none open until they came to the Exchange Taverne, where it happened the door was open to admit in some Labourers to work, and there they entred; for the Parson would needs treat her with a Glasse of Wine, which they had, and the Gen∣tleman of the house being up, They desired his company, she, as she said, being willing to shift off the Parson, told him, she would stay there till people were more stirring, and would leave word at that house where she would go. So after two or three pints he paid and departed, with the hopes of finding her again, And be∣ing alone with the Gentleman of the house, the teares standing in her eyes, she began to bewaile her self. Mr King asked her the rea∣son? She with Crocodile teares, and in a canting stile, began to re∣collect her Adventure: How she was a Stranger, and Sr. said she, I would willingly be private and unknown, and therefore beg you to do me excuse; Only this favour I entreat of you, to inform me of a convenient Lodging, fit for a Gentlewoman, though a stranger. The Gentleman replyed he knew of none at present, but wished he could serve her desire; And after such like discourse, Madam, said he, I condole your condition, and if you please to accept for the pre∣sent of such a one as I have, which sometime hath been, and is in some measure fit to entertain a person of quality upon an exigent, it shall be & is at your service. She seemingly reflecting on her Honor, in respect that the house was publick, earnestly entreated his privacy, for that would salve her honour; And with many thanks for so great a courtesie accepted thereof very willingly, And Sr. said she, only I desire your concealement of what I shall relate to you, for you seem to be a person of gravity, and of great civility to me; And that you may not mistrust and disesteem of me, though I am unwilling as yet to be known, but especially by my own Declaration, yet I will in brief inform you what I am, and my present condition, which is thus, Sir, I am a Person of honour lately come out of Germany, my Native Country, my Father was an Earl, my Mother dyed in
Chilbed with me, about three years after my Father dyed, and left me to the tuition of an English Lady, a Maiden, to be my Gover∣ness, one of my Mothers Kindred that lived with her; And the better to secure my person and Estate, she out of her great love to me went with me into a Monastery, for Protection, from whence I came out about a year since, and have lived at mine own house. Our Emperour and the holy Fathers were willing to force me to a Mar∣riage with an old Count, because, having no Children, my Estate might return to the Monastery; the profits thereof they received for my maintenance there; and had I staid a little longer it had been compleated: and you may imagine Sir, how miserable a Life I should have lead, in this unagreeable Marriage; For I am now but nineteen or there abouts, and he was near fourscore. So being in my own Park that belongs to my house, my Governess came and told me, I must then lay hold on an opportunity for my escape, if ever, which I willingly consented too and stayed no longer then to disrobe my self, and put on this disguise wherein you see me, (where by the way I will set down what that was, an old black Velvet Wastecoat, and a Black Silk Petticoat, and black Hoods over her Face) And I will speak of one thing more while she was relating this story, I ask∣ed her, why she would have no attendance? She answered me, that indeed she had very many Pages and Lacquies, and several Maid-ser∣vants and Gentlewomen, but she did not think it safe to take any with her, least they might discover her in her slight; But I took a Page with me to bring my horse back that I rod on near to the Sea∣side, where in a little time I took shipping.) I was, said she, last Sunday morning in France, landed at Dover, rod Post to Graves∣end, took the opportunity of the Barge that was coming off, where I met with this Priest, who would needs wait on me, which I won∣dred at, for I was never in any mans company before I made my ad∣ventur. And Sir, said she, If he cometh again to ask for me, let me be denyed. And since I have related to you what I am, and that you do not entertain a Beggar though a stranger, so I entreat your secrecy; and whatever I shall presume to call for, during my stay here, though I have little Silver, yet I have that whereby I shall dis∣charge & satisfy you. After such like discourse, she retired her self to her Chamber, and lay on the Bed till about Dinner time; when at her desire, the Gentlewoman of the house (my sister) went up to
give her a civil welcome, and to accompany her, whose acquaintance she having got, after some salutes past on either side, and some fami∣liarity begun on both sides, she related to her in her discourses the former story, with more additions, and with the obligation of secre∣cy also. Thus privatly in her Chamber she remained some time at her work she had procured, which she would do quick and well, which was to be expected from those that come out of Nunneries: Sometime at her seeming devotion. The afternoon of the same day, the Parson came again, and according to her order was denyed. The next day they Tabled together, and she desired the Gentlewoman of the house to be private, and also to honour her with the title of Cousen, to prevent the mistrusts and questions of such persons, as might accidentally see her in her company. The Gentlewoman (my sister) hearing her propable well set Story and good Language, sup∣posed her to be as she said, and did much comiserate her present condition, and remained no lesse compassionate for her sorrow then admired at her parts; and being of an excellent loving Nature, and friendly▪ curteous, disposition, did much resent her Adventure, and gave her handsome entertainment, and consented to her obliged se∣crecy and desired Title. Here (Curteous Reader) you may see, how this Sycophant baited her hook with seeming obliged secrecy. I suppose she first intended to catch the Gentleman of the house, to trust her by degrees with something of good value, and so left him to look her: A trick she and her Agents have practised by slight of hand, very many times, as you shall one day fully know, though not by my hand, yet by my order. Now Reader, I am come to relate what I am Ey-witness of, and to begin my acquaintance with this Grand Impostor. After she had been two or three days at the aforesaid house, my occasions called me that way, (not thinking to meet or see such a person as this) and after I had compleated my business, I called in at this house, to give my Relations a visit and repose my self a while being somewhat weary. When I came in▪ I was informed there were some Gentle∣men persons of quality in the house, (who had dined there that day) that had lately obliged me by some civilities, and I being alone did imbrace their company, where I found the Gentleman of the house and his wife, and this Canterbury German; that is, (a little to leave
my Story) A she Creature like a Spanish Jennet, got by the wind, for she knows nor owns no Father, Cui Pater est populus pater est sibi nullus et omnis, Cui Pater est populus non habet illa patrem. In English a Bastard, or, a German Soul transmigrated into the Body of a Canterbury Fidlers Daughter: or a German Fiddle-stick, playd upon a Canterbury Fiddle: or, the Sperm of a Germane Lord mixt with, and evacuated into an Ale-Tub, and drank up by a Canterbury Hostes, of which came this Prodigious Excrescens, or, &c. I will not be tedious, this two-legged Monster then) a pretended German Lady, was amongst the aforesaid company, who, at my entring the room and making towards the company, as it was observed, and she her self hath many times declared, did very much eye me; and be∣fore I came near her, I was stopt sometime with the salutes and com∣plements of the Gentlemen my friends, who singly accosted me. In this time she asked the Gentlewoman of the house who I was? She resolved her, I was her Brother, which answer did not satisfie her; For, as she hath declared sundry times to very many persons, who as I said before will subscribe, at that instant, she was possessed with a strange kind of an affectionate passion, and suddainly surprized by Love; and as she expressed it, her blood boyld within her, in such a strange manner, she knew not what she ailed. By this time it came to my turn to salute her, which done, We began to enterchange friendly Glasses for about an hour. My Friends and my Self were then about to take our leave, occasions calling us away; but my Sister being desired by her to detain me, would not permit me to go: So taking my leave of the Gentlemen I remained there. The Gentle∣woman of the house and she entertained some Female discourses of Fashions, and I was ordering my business in my mind, and sat fumi∣gating Sr. Nicots Herbe; and though my eyes were on them, my mind was remote. But being unwilling to come under the notion of a Clown, she seeming by her broaken Langnage to be a Stranger, I did now and then passe a Complement with a Glasse of Wine to her, which she did as often return to me. I then little thought of a Wife; for my mind being intent on a considerable business, which I was engaged to do in the behalf of a friend, I was not so active in my expressions, and curteous in my actions and behaviour to her, as be∣ing a stranger both to me, and as she seemed to the Country too▪ Nor did I then know more of her, then by discourse I understood
she had been a Nun; she had strange careless and modest glances on me with her eyes, and I am sure mine were more careless then hers could be, for it never once past my thoughts to be exposed to her. After a considerable stay, and the dark had overshadowed the world, I was willing to depart, but still her oblidgeings detained me. And amongst other discourses, we began to speak of an excellent Play next day to be Acted, she presently desired to see this Coun∣try mode in Acting, and procured a promise from me to accompany her and another Gentleman, which I had kept and performed the next day, had not the urgency of my occasions pressed me to ad∣mit of no delay. After the revolution of 2 or 3 dayes, I was sum∣moned by my occasions that way againe, and being in the House, she came and check'd me for non-performance of my promise, telling me what a great degradation in point of Gentility it is in her Coun∣try, and Drollingly put a name on me, which name with the title of (My) before it, she often called me. Still she would act and speak so modestly and majestickly as could be expected, to maintain and make her pretences seem real, and she used good language, though in a broken tone, ever relating of sublime honourable acti∣ons, and when she was put to a dilema in her discourse, she would seem to be so angry with her self, because she could not express her self in our tongue to that highth as she would; and indeed I won∣dred she could speak English so well, and I would ask her how she came to learn it, she answered, that her Governess being an English Lady, she would speak English to her, and discourse and write in no other tongue on purpose to be perfect in it, for said she, It is a great piece of Honour for Persons of Quality in our Country to speak many Tongues, and I over fancied to learn English more then any other, though I can speak several tongues. Thus would she answer all objections as readily as you could ask her; and she when she was with me, would commonly fall into a suddain exclamation, saying, me thinks it is so strange to me to be in a mans Company; what should I be thought of and esteemed, and what would you be done to Sir, should I be seen to sit with you thus in our Country; It is a great freedome that the English Ladies have, yet I could not do it, but that I see you are a very civil person, and such like smoothing sayings she would to me, yet seeming loving but careless; which because I was not
forward, but as careless as her self, though I then perceived her parts, yet not knowing what she was, I seemed to mind nothing of her; till upon a third opportunity she had of seeing me, I was pretty jocose with her, and being left alone awhile, she began to break her mind to me at a distance, and then came nearer, that I might per∣ceive her fancy, which I did, and stood suspended at her speech; and after some serious, yet amarous expressions, she related to me the full story (which till then I knew not) of her great Adventure; It seemed to me to be a pretty Romance. she declared to me the cause why, the manner how, and a fuller Relation then I have insert∣ed before, and so went on in her discourse, ever now and then call∣ing to mind Gods mercy to her in preserving her, though she said, she was so resolved that she had rather the Sea had been her Grave, then to be confined to the embraces of the old Count. I could do no less then applaud her Adventures and noble resolution, though all my sences were even converted into eyes and eares, being plung∣ed in so great an extacie. Thus she went on, still interweaving with her discourse such kind of holy expressions and Religious sayings (the better to ground a beleife in me) sometimes acting the part of a Saint, for in that she imitated the Devils craft; when he means to deceive one that is vigilent and careful, he translates himself into an Angel of Light, and laying before on some apparent seeming goods, at last brings his in∣tention to pass, and sometimes of a person of great quality in a mis∣fortunate discontent. And when she spoke of the Lord, her pretended Father, (by name as she told me, Iohn de Wallway, Earle of Roscia in or near Colonia) and her Lady Mother, she would offer a kind of devotion to their Shrine; and then she would seem to cub her self when she told me of her great Birth and Fortune, because she was so much her own Trumpet, and might be thought to brag of what God had made her and gave her, a thing saith she below my Honour, but I see you are so much a Gentleman you will scorne to betray me, or have any hard censure of me, and knowing your Gentility will oblidge you to secrecy, I presume to be free with you, for noble souls cannot act basely; For (said she) should it be known at this Court that I were in England, and also where I was, I am sure his Royal Majesty (Pardon (My Leige) him whose saithful heart and hand like a true
Subjects are always ready armed, and so shall continue as long as it shall please Heaven to lend me breath) to show their allegiance to their Soveraigne, and the humble desire they have to be employed in your Majestyes Royal Service) who is allied to me, by my Mo∣thers side, would quickly send for me. His Majesty was in the Mo∣nastery with me when he came to see the Princes Lenitia, who was in the same Monastery, and their Highnesses the Duke of Yorke and Glocester were with him there, after they came from the French Court and were entertained by our Emperour; and said she, as soon as my Attendance come over, that I may goe as my self and his Relation, I shall give his Majesty a Visit and kiss his hand. Should his Majesty see me in this Disguise, I am sure he would know me; for when he was in the Monastery (as Princes have that liberty to come in) his Majesty called these Moles or Warts (which are 3 over and 3 under her right eye) Charles his Waine, and these spots on my hand, his Highness the Noble Duke of Glocester made himself. Nay further still, this pretended Germane Lady, had in her pocket a Pass as she called it, for her Steward, written in French, which she said his Majesty Signed and Sealed at Brussels, and several Gentle∣men that saw it, said it was his Majestys Hand and Seal; (But this when we searcht for it at the Justices, when she was apprehended, could not be found, for I beleive she burnt it the night she burnt those Counterfeit Letters, that were by her order sent her, which was the night we discovered her, as you shall hereafter read.) And said she, I know our Emperour will send to this Court, but first he will send to the French Court, and by that time I hope to have all things over and secured here. Curteous Ladyes and Gentlemen, Imagine what you should had thought, had you been in my place and Condition; had you heard her speak this, seen her deportment, and had accompanyed her so much as I did, and observed all her probable storyes and circum∣stances, which I do but abridge and contract here, and to have found her so ingenious a Woman (as indeed she is, to give the Divel his Due) and were she honest, she were excellent; but having lost that she is (truly I cannot tell what, I will not call her Woman, because I will not disgrace her Sex) a meer shape only? It is true, an Army of jealousies did assault my breast, and entered, some I sent forth by my objections to her, which she presently struck dead. For the next
sentence she spake, she would meet my objections above half way with so ready an answer, and reply without the least pausing, being ready charged, and as readily presented, which made the other spyes fear to goe forth. Indeed as there is no man that hath the least sparke of Honour in his breast, but would had beleived such seem∣ingly, probable, noble acted, serious and religious pretended truth, so there is no person that hath the least spark of Wisdome, but would make some mistrustful queries: And I dare affirme it, that when I was absent from her, I made as many as any man could, and when present, I objected to her as many as I could in point of Honour. Sup∣pose the thing a while but to be real, that after she had broach'd her mind to me, how much she loved me, which did daily seem to en∣crease also, and notwithstanding I objected my inequality of Birth & Fortune, the last whereof I attested was not as yet a younger Brothers Portion, though a younger Brother & denyed that it was fit to carry single, which was the most; (a Circumstance I thought material to try her fancy) yet still she vowed to like me the better, and that she did neither desire nor look for any thing of me, not with me, but only my love, and I thought she did really deserve that; but if I pleased I might dispose of all I had; for God (said she) hath be∣stowed a sufficient and a plentiful Estate on me, which with my self I freely offer and give to you Sir. Such Nobility had she but acted with reality (which then was thought so, and not without just grounds) could not but force and attract a love and likeing from a stone if possible, and indeed I made some scruple of danger by reason of her birth and pretended great, yet near Re∣lation. And also I asked her why she would condiscend to incline her affection to so (then seeming) unequal marriage; she did re∣ply, that whatsoever my Fortune was, was not material in a noble breast, neither did it compleat a Gentleman; but said she, Nature hath dealt very liberally and bountifully by you, both in your per∣son and parts, on which I set my affections, I can supply Fortune. And said she, I am not the first as we daily see, when affection hath induced to make choice of a Consort far underneath and below the sphere where you move, nay those that move in a higher Orbe then my self, and then would she bring in an example, and I did sensibly imagine, (had her pretences been real) that I should create no new Custome, or commit any error to embrace the smiles of For∣tune,
but did and should rather impute it to a great hand of Provi∣dence, whose hand is as great and good still as ever, and truly she said such things as I knew not how it was possible that untruth should have the ability to faine things resembling so much in shew truth it self, and I am confident her seeming excellent parts, variety of tongues, sweet disposition, and indifferent comely feature, noble presence and modest carriage, accompanyed with so many protestati∣ons and arguments of unfained and real high affection, and then seem∣ing great trouble at her spirits, and amorous words were able to con∣quer and enthral any other heart, though as free and careful as mine. And indeed she fained excuses so plauseable, that I being over∣powered, either by my nature, will, or affection, admitted them for being reasonable, many queryes my Jealousie would summon up and object to her: And in answering one, she would traverse over so much, and such a seeming real story, that she would satisfie me in very many points, that my private suspitions thought to propose to her; by which freeness of hers to declare her self, she not only pro∣cured of me a greater beleife to what she said, but also gave me a fur∣ther insight to her good language and parts, and likewise to her passionate love she then seemed to have for and towards me, all which discourses she would commonly conclude, with my self by saying, All this I freely offer to thee my Dear, and all these sufferings are nothing considering God hath provided such a blessing for me as thy self, and such like conclusions, whose Amen was commonly an Embrace, or a (Lime Twigge) Kiss, with a Hymn of Thanks-giving to Providence. Her freeness in relateing, did much please me, for this reason, because it did stop all strict inquisition, which in point of Honour I could not make to her, that seemed so free; notwith∣standing I told her my Fortune was altogether unequal and unfit to cay double, and also only secundum voluntatem Domini, as I may so say, but yet my fearful mind would make a multitude of private questions, some open ones, which when I had opportunity I would fetch over at a distance, by a Similitude or a Romance of some for∣mer adventure, or some such story; and I doe not deny, but declare that her freeness in acting so nobly pleased me, because she so freely offered that then seeming noble offering, her self, (whom indeed I thought then a rate present, and should think so still, were she but honest, which greives me she is not:) and also the free offer of her
seeming Fortune, which I Vow to all the world I esteemed of as nothing (had it been real) compared with her, if honest; for as to fortune my desires are limitted, and if they do exceed, it is rather to contemplate the beauty of Heaven, then the pleasures of Earth, steps whereby the soul Travels towards its first dwelling: For as I told her, I desired her to Licence my Fortunes to roul in their own Sphere; and it was thought I was of years sufficient though under age to make an election of my state it self, and I protest I never did look at what she spake as to that, any further then a blessing and comfortable help, to ease the trouble & defray the growing charges of a Matryed Life; and to maintain Love, which like a fire without fuel would grow cold in some, as is too commonly seen, though I dare speak it, and I make no doubt, my love without it should had n'ere gone out; for I here solemnly attest, I could rather drive a Plow, or dig and delve for one that I Love, (as I did her) though no∣thing but her parts took my fancy, then to live a Princes life and be forced to enjoy one that I cannot fancy, For I am too effeminate; a tear From one I love, goes deeper then a speare: Nay when I thought her mine, if she were ill, Love sympathiz'd so much, I was not well. My love was so much, that I dare not think of some things past then, but my heart doth sink: But that I know shee's false, I else should swear There were no faith, no honesty if not here: Let her be witness that betray'd me hath; But who'l beleive a witness without Faith. Me thinks I could love still, and still beleive, But Syren like i'me sure she'l still deceive. Providence whispers me, and faith i'me gone, If I give room unto affection. Lord marke these Serpentt, that the world may know Whom they may trust, and whom they may forgoe. Proclaimed foes we easier may evade, Then those base traps that are in friendship laid: But Reader, let not these rimes thee offend, Griefe brought them in, not a designed end. Reader, When I had even thus far proceeded, there came to my hand by a friend of mine, a cursed Volumne of hers of 3 Sheets in
Quarto,, termed An Historical Narrative of the Germane Princess (alias Pickpurse) each of the words have but two Syllables, and I am sure the last Character is the truest,) which she ownes to have wrote her self, as by her Epistle thereto you may perceive, though not beleive, for I can testefie, and shortly may to some purpose pro∣duce the unmannerly, base and beggerly detractor, her true Com∣panion, who being joyned with her, make a cursed paire of Machavi∣lians, and who wrote and composed the book for her, but I will not defile my paper with his Name; for though I remain in Tenebris I have information of her actions and Hectoring Companions: In which book she Courts the world to beleive that she is a great Phi∣losopher, or well read in the sayings of both ancient and moderne Philosophers and Divines: Which acquaintance of hers with them, as I do not at all beleive, but utterly deny, so I do not indeavour to tye up any one to my opinion herein. The first Philosopher she (or some one for her) names, is Diogenes the Cinick, who had he lived now, would have ascribed to her, her just title, and stiled her (what she really is) a Viper, The opinion and Thesis she first inserts, from her or some others collection, is this, that detraction is the cheife branch of envy, which is nourished by lying, by which people of honest conversation, are grievously wounded. The last clause we have suffered, as the world is sensible of, the former she hath ful∣ly performed; and I truly think, that if she should live till she speaks and writes nothing but truth, she would never dye. As to her Conversation it is well known to some hundreds in this Nation, how dishonest it hath been even from her Infancy, to the ruine of many persons and Families almost, Quo semel est imbuta recens sur∣vabit odorem orta. Indeed there is none can wonder that she writes such a multitude of falsityes in plain English horrible lyes, for should she write the truth of her actions, nay of any one act (which act of hers as to my self, I will declare for her) she would then quite shame her self for ever, which in a little time if she hath any shame in her, will be done nevertheless. Read the fourth page of her book in her Epistle, where she blames me for not affording her a civil defence (though this is only to blind the world, and make them beleive I had permitted her to be uncivilly dealt by, when as I Vow to Heaven there was no such thing) in regard she saith I had so lately enjoyed Hymens rites with her, would the Divel had had his right, then I should not have been troubled with such a crafty Strumpet; But he
may take it now, there's flesh and bones enough for him to pick, it is his own and she will hardly cheat him, he will have his own, aut serius aut citius. And in the same page she commends the prudence of our Ancestors, in insituting several Orders of Knights to defend innocent Ladies; and she saith, that she never read of any Knight that undertook a distressed Ladies quarrel but he overcame, and then brings in an example or two. It makes me smile methinks to see, how cunningly her guilt seeks to be protected by some of the Dub'd souls of this age, whom at one and the same time she Courts and applauds at a distance to contiuue their protection to her still. I say how finely she wyre-draws these Dons to defend her impuden∣cy, under the notion of innocency. A favour she hath already re∣ceived of some Quixots, or perhaps ere this she might have had her expressed not intended choice, and have been dissolved into Atoms for her just deserts, which she acknowledges, only she saith in the a∣foresaid page, That she was insufficiently prosecuted; which because we were not so rigid as we might, being well advised, as you shall hereafter hear, or as it hath happened rather ill advized, it was suffi∣cient evidence against her to disanul my Marriage, had there been less witness then was produced, which by the Oath of the Witnesse that swore was void, ipso facto. I will not speak all I know as to her practises therein, as to this matter, for it is past, and notwith∣standing this, the world will shortly find enow that will know her and will speak their mind. Did you but hear the curses and exclama∣tions of so great a number that know her and her actions, some whereof she hath abused highly, as the Cities of London and Canter∣bury will produce, who would think it no sin to stone her to death for the wrong she hath done, and would at any time travel a hun∣dred miles to see Justice executed on her. Whose cursed Actions, though as yet we see Have Justice scapt, her end will [a rope. Finis] be. And they that would endeavour to defame her, Need use no other words, but only name her. I shall leave every Judicious Reader to see how impropably she re∣lates, and how disjoynted her story hangs, which fained & cursed re∣lation of hers (for she owns it and it is like her) Do but compare it with the truth it self, which by all my aforesaid asserations you shall and have read here, then you may give your Verdict, and you will finde her justly Guilty, which by Justice it self she is; For here
every word and sentence shall carry so much, and such undeniable and well known truth, both to her self, and many others to whom this Books relation will be no news; That I say every sentence shall bring her in Guilty in the great and just Court of Conscience, though she seems by her great and damnable stock of impudence to allow of no such Court of Equity and Chamber of Justice. Read the sixth page of her Book, where you shall finde some mite witted pedantick Coxcomb hath collected for her, the opinion and great respects several Philosophers and Nations have had to that great Virtue called Truth: and you shall see the disrespects he or she hath for it; For they do not desire to tell you the truth, only what Truth is in the eye of the vertuous. She saith she will observe its Precepts in her discourse; but she doth not nor dare, not dare not promise you to practise it, so cunningly she goes on that a cur∣sitory eye shall not finde out her double meaning. I will not singly object here against her writing, but in my relation I shall fully de∣monstrate the truth of her, and her politick and printed lyes. I will speak but to one thing more particularly, (though I am unwilling to leave off hee) that is this, In the twelfth page of her Book she in∣setts a Letter as if it should come from me, and I should send to the Gate-house to her, which she saith She will keep as a Relict. To this I answer, by all my aforesaid attestations or what more any one will, I never wrote or caused to be wrote, sent or caused to be sent, or knew of any such Letter till I saw such a thing in her Book. Nay further, I was at that time and as on the day of the date of that pre∣tended letter in Canterbury, at the house of one that calls her daugh∣ter Law, by name Richard Foud a Fidler & Alehouse-keeper, where I saw her own Mother and brethren, as he acknowledged to us. And though she in the fifth page of her book, is so cursedly impudent (though here rather but cunningly wondring at) as to seem to deny my former Relation as to her Father, in my late printed sheet, which is to the aforesaid purpose of his acknowledging her; yet I say, here she craftily useth these words by way of admiration, saying, It is strange this Father of mine could not be produced at my Tryal, if it had been true. Thus doth this politick Devil by her musical spee∣ches cheat the World, especially the ignorant still. For what need had we to have her Father up, and being her Knavish Agent what good would he do? Such a Michanick fellow as he is, a little thing might have perhaps made him say any thing. Nay further, as to a
Letter, I never sent her one in my Life; but one time before mar∣riage and after great acquaintance, and I think contraction, She de∣sired me, If I could not come to her once a day to send her a Letter how I did, that she might understand my health, and do her respects to my hand when she had not my person present, which would give her much comfort, to read my words when she could not hear me speak them, and such like amorous discourses and reasons she alleadged to me. And remembring her desire I wrot one once, but being sent it not: and the next time I saw her, it happened to drop me, which she taking at her earnest request, she kept it, vowing so to do ever during life. And this is that Letter she makes mention of in the ninth page of her Book, which she lost, (and I fou) storming of her Out-workes, whose Inn-workes have been with a P— (I mean plainly Gentlemen) often enough, (though I thank providence I cannot) will still subscribe est. But I will desist in answering the perticulars, for in my proceedings I shall perticularly answer all things. I am unwilling to be tedious, and therefore will but abridge as I proceed; and though she in a bad Cause writes often and much, thinking sure either I can∣not or dare not answer: so I will do it once now and to the pu∣pose; and she will find the English Proverb true, What her much stirring now will shortly do. —For be assur'd none (though they may awhile) Can glory long in Perjury and Guile. Vice may find faou and protection get, But Virtue quickly will aan end Finis set. Nature was out of tune sure, when she ma'e This Soul-less Monster, this prodigious shade, This Carkas of pollutio, a heart she hath But empty, neither Soul in it, nor Faith. Only in shape aoman, nay scarce so, For Proteus like she can in all shaes go. Her qualities are painted like : Her Actions glosses, better  to Religion is her Mask, whereby the plays Both fast and lose a Devil in a maze. The very breath one uses to declare Her name, sufficient is infect the Aire.
And may those keep her to themselves alone That finds a Soul in her, for I found none. In brief, this Maxim ever take for granted Ther's no such Devil, as a Woman Sainted. But I have a little deserted my intended relation, and I hope Gen∣tlemen you will not be offended that I have shifted the Scene so often, to represent the Act more lively and with better perfection. And now I must alter the Scne again, and passing by the several que∣stions of the state and fashions of her pretended Country, which she readily answered, I desired her to give me and some others, A Narra∣tion of the Ceremonies of a Nunnery, which she willingly did, rela∣ting also some passages and accidents whilst she was there, and the Ceremonies they use in consecrating a Nun. And amongst other relations, she brought into discourse the cause why, and the manner how the Princess Lewitia came to the Monastery, (wherein she pre∣tended she was which was the strict order of St. Clare, relating the manner of her knocking at the Gate, and how attended, and how re∣ceived by the Lady Abbes, and of the stately Robes that every Nun at Consecration is adorned with: and how they dis-robe themselves and offer their rich attire at the high Altar, and then they slip be∣hind a hanging and put on a hair shift as Nuns weare; And during the time of this Ceremony, what rare Antheams are Sung, and then how and where they dispose and put the Riches and Jewels they bring in with them: How often they go to Chappel in a day and night, and how little time they rest at night in their stone Cells. And said she, into this Order none but great Persons and Heiresses are received some for Protection, some upon discontent will go in and be Consecrated, and many such like discourses, how a handsome young Lady (whilst she was there) made her escape through a narrow sinck. Thus would she go on, and express her self with a great seeming de∣votion, and much pity that so many noble and fine Ladies should do so much Penance and Mortification (a great word with her which she would much use to me) as they do in a Monastery. And that those Heiresses that go in for Protection, may be consecrated if they please, And at such an age they have a year and a day allowed them for Pro∣bation or Tryal; during which time, the Consecrated Nuns would Court them that were on Probation, to be Consecrated also: Setting before her or them that was so upon Tryal, the holy Service they are devoted to, the cares of the world they are freed from, the dangers of
Marriage, and the continual greife that waites it, and many such frightful and weaning  storys which (said she) they used to me also to court me to stay, and asked me if I did intend to marry, I answered (saith she) I could not tell that as yet, but I could serve God abroad in the world as well as here, and might do much good and Charity with my Estate; and as to marriage, that (said she) I leave to decrees of Heaven; for if I should fancy any one to come to my em∣braces, I desire of God, and did use to say to my Governess (here per∣haps was a sigh) that I would marry a private civil Gentleman, and a younger Brother, and one that is free from the wickedness and debau∣chery of all Courts; for I should oblidge such a Gentleman I am sure (said she) to love me heartily, nobly, and in a high nature, for with∣out Love, should I meet with one, as Courtier like said she, only loved and Courted my Estate, it would quickly end my dayes, or by a violent death I should end them my self. And here Reader I dare leave her to judge how my love was link'd to her, whil'st I esteemed her vertuous; and she cannot say, nay I beleive she will not say, but that I loved her heartily, honestly and nobly, until the world (which cut my very soul asunder) proved her dishonest, though she will not seem to acknowledg it; and in∣deed I cannot blame her, to hide that which would quite shame her. Nay upon her discovery, Witness many persons and actions, I could not but love her and beleive her till so many attested it, that they cast my soul into a trance, yet I did civilly by her; But in regard it concernes my self, I am silent. But to goe on, my Dear said she, God hath sent me a mighty blessing, Mine Heartchie, Mine scape, Mine Leiveta, Mine Egin, Egin Leiveta, breaking off with these and such like Dutch expressions of Love (which laughing with one or two more she could chatter in, and an embrace or a salute) in pro∣viding me one so much to my souls desire and earnest prayers. The greatest earthly blessing God could bestow on me, and I shall day and night express my gratitude to Almighty Providence for thee my heart; for amongst all the favours God of his bounty hath bestowed on me, in giving to me with so liberal a hand the Goods of Fortune, for which though I cannot answer with sufficient gratitude, yet I esteem my self for ever highly bound to poue out my soul with thanks and teares of joy for that noble and high prized guift of thee my Dear and right noble soul; then would she seem to cry for joy, and wish her self surer mine, and I hers; and then again she would sigh
for sorrow that she could not demonstrate her self in actions as yet; but saith she my words will speedily now be fully compleatea and nobly acted, and I shall be in a capacity my Dear to gratefie your great civi∣lity. Me thinks I see her passages, and by all that is true, I can hardly goe any further, and scarce dare to think her false, but that her detracting prints her absence from me, and mine from my self, as I may properly say, and such like occurrences makes me remem∣ber the cause, and the late false reports commands me to go on and speak the truth which as yet I have, and have put in as good security for that which ensues; that is, what I relate before my acquaintance is as she told me; that I declare since, I do attest to, and though I cannot remember, neither do I promise to set down every word she expressed her self by, though I have used very many of them, yet I have and will truely (though breifly in respect of her words and gestures) set down and insert the manner, matter and substance of her discurses and acts. You may imagine better perhaps then I can express, that she haveing begun such a designe, and pretending to be such a person, how cunningly she glossed over her Romantick sto∣ryes and pretences with great zeal as comeing from a Nunnery, a handsome and noble deportment as a person of quality, and good language as being well breed; all which are but suitable, and to be expected to make her self out, had she been what she pretended and represented her self to be, which seeming reality did in a growing familiarity and acquaintance encrease mine and many wise persons beleife. But I will not tyre your patience Gentle Reader, and therefore will forbear to relate the several further (though material) plots and stratagems she used to undermine me, and to discipate my jealousies, and extract a credit: How upon her first comeing to the Exchange Tavern, she sent Letters by the post to Germany, and be∣fore an answer was returned, and while her design was going on, how she set her Agents ac work to give out at some publique places, where she knew and had heard me speak of in discourse (but seeming to take no notice) I had familiar acquaintance, and often frequented in and about London, what gratuity should be given to any one that could make a discovery of a German Lady of great Quality and Fortune, which was a 100 l. and also her obligations she laid upon me, under pretence of a passionate Love, whereby she desired and commanded me daily to be with her, that her soul might find rest: And when I did visit her, how neatly she would relate to me the
dreams of the last night, and the unquietness she had in her bed, some∣times so amarous, that she imagined she embraced me, sometimes fear∣ful that she thought I was sick, with such like amplifications. And then how earnestly she desired to enjoy my company alone, to take the Aire in a Coach, or by Water, which we often did; and then she would so bait my fancy by her many and high expressions of Love to me, and care of and for me, and such like Love passages. And after such pastime, when we returned to her Lodging, how unwillingly she was to let me depart, being angry with the Night that it grew on so fast. And then to see how melancholly she would sit down, and seem to bewaile her present unsetledness, and the absence of her Dear Governess, which name com∣monly produced a sigh or a tear, to whom she said she was for ever ob∣lidged to show Love and respect, not so much for Relation sake, as for her great Love, in leaving all the world, and her many noble proffers of Mar∣riage to go into the Monastery with her. And thus for about three weeks did she linck my fancy to her. And here I think good to speak to one most untrue (yet politick) Relation she wites concerning me. That I should pretend to be a Lord, and Courted her in a great Aequipage, I suppose she hath a double meaning in it, and shows how she acted her part, only she puts my name to it Mutato Nomine De te, fabula Nar∣ratur: Change but her name and title, and she means and speaks of her self, for by all my aforesaid asseverations I never assumed any other title, or set my self in a higher rank then Providence had placed me in, nei∣ther did I alter my Habit any otherwise then I used to go in which was commonly black, decent, and civil enough I am sure, nay somthing unfit to Court a Mistriss; but my Habit was pleasing enough to me, for I neither had a desire nor a design to Court any one, though I was Court∣ed by her: But I never had any great respect to a Habit, whereby to make any distinction of dayes, times, or place, which all that know me can justifie; and therefore I will not stick here. This is but like the rest; Who can expect that she should write any thing but prodigious and execrable falsifies, for she hath no truth in the least to be a plea for her self, but I will hasten and will ship many Circumstances and well baited hooks, and turn over many leaves at once, because I will not be tedious, and will relate 2 or 3 passages more before I come to enter the sacrid Lists of Matrimony with this Saint-like Divel, with whom my ac∣quaintance was above three Weeks before I was married to her; for as I told her in such weighty affaires, as to consent to marry, especially with a strange or mature deliberation was very requisite, and not to run post hast to hazzard ones welfare, But she being so highly in love with
me as she pretended by her expressions, how little rest her soul had in my absence, and what raptures of joy and delight in my presence, and so earnestly solliciting and praying mine integrity, though acquainted with my quality, husted me forward to that too late repented action of Ma∣trimony; for in Love adventures, none are accomplished with more facility and brevity then that which is favoured by the Womans desire, and pricked on by her Prayers and teares. About a week before Marri∣age we were contracted, for though she wished her self mine, yet she would not Marry until Lent was out, for her Religion would not per∣mit that, and till she could demonstrate her self more by her actions, and that she had either a return of her Letters to see how things stood, or that her Governess and her Goods and Moneys were come over which might soonest happen she could not tell, but she expected all in Easter week at the furthest. And here I will relate one passage that presently after Contraction she damnably acted, which was this; She did but rise and sit down in a Couch, and instantly she fell into a strange sound∣ing fit: (Which trick, many that know her in London, say, was a pretend∣ed and usual Custome with her to do when she pleased, and they say, the first time as she did ever so, was when for some of her former cheating actions she was whipt about the streets, and I suppose to prevent the stripes she counterfeited that fit) in which strange fit then as it seemed to me, she remained a good while: the Gentleman that was with me, well understanding Physick, fought and gave her somewhat to drink in a glass, which being put to her mouth, she bit a piece off; that doing her no good, he went down (leaving me to hold her, which was as much, nay more then I could well do from falling on the floare) to fetch some feathers to burn under her, which being burnt, and she not coming to her self, he went for more, she strove hard with me in his absence, she being still in her fit, though beginning to come to her self, she earnestly cryed out Where is my Governess, where is my Woman, at which time the Gentlewoman of the House where we were came up into the Room, I said she is here, and opening her eyes, she stared at her, but could not, or would not speak as yet; thus did this Divel incarnate still Counterfeit. When she was well, a Coach waiting at the door, we rode further to take the Aire; I asked her the reason of this Fit, she replyed she could not tell, but thinking what she had done, struck a suddain passion in her, for said she, I never had any before. Sometime after this, and about 3 dayes before my (not then so soon pected) Marriage, coming from a Play in the Evening, she would
needs give that most discreet and excellent natured Gentlewoman Mother a visit, and come acquainted with her: After salutes past on each side, they fell into discourse; she called her Mother, for said she, Nothing but Death shall part my Dear and I, pointing to me: My Mo∣ther wondring at her affectionate passage, asked her the Reason of her fancy to me, of so unequal and small Fortune: She replyed mine is suf∣ficient; you may suppose Reader I abridge every passage. She having heard of some mistrusts my friends had made and given out, began to ar∣gue the Case the better to satisfie and procure a Credit in my Mother: For said she, had I a design to Cheat, I should had sored very high; my Mother then replyed, that none were ignorant, that a Marryed life with∣out a plentiful Estate was very uncomfortable; Mother said she, it is very certain; do you think I am a Iew, a Turk, a Heathen (these were her words) that I should think of, much more do such a thing as go about to ensuare any Gentleman; I would not for a World be found in an untruth, for what I say, is as true as Heaven. Ah Cursed Atheist, thus did she endeavour to satisfie her in all her objections, who thought it not a piece of civility to object further, and was for the present satisfied from then further objecting, yet could not be free from mistrusts when absent, and out of her Motherly love & care to me, would still put in a Cave, and bid me take heed, which I then thought needed not; for I would say, as in∣deed any one would, that she could not be false, so much I beleived her: To be short, the next day being Good Friday, she came with me againe to desire my Mothers Company to take the Aire, and then she did see that Learned, Judicious and Worthy ancient Gentleman my Father, whom she after salutes past termed so also, and in discourse relared to him, (he objecting as my Mother did) her great affection to me even from the first minute she saw me, and she was so free in declaring every thing to them both, that they did not, nor needed not to ask much, and from that time (they to whom I owe the duty of a Son, which could I double, they do nobly deserve) had a very good opinion of her parts, whose de∣serts they did acknowledg claimed high; as to the other, they could but hope the best; and by my soul, I think and know that in their thoughts for my sake and her seeming deserts, they had Adopted her an own Daughter, but Optima Corrupta, pessima. And though she hath since aspersed them with cruelty, the world knows there was none acted on her in the least, nay nothing was done that can come within the terme of incivility; but what was done to her for that unspeakable abuse she act∣ed me was but according to Law and honesty, and I could do no less.
But she cannot detract from their reputation, though she may make here smell more loathsome. The next day she dined there, after dinner we od forth to take the aire with my Mother, my Brother (who then I think had seen her four times) and another Gentleman, which afternoon, had you but heard her discourse tending to her former Narration, and seen her so well and nobly act Love passages to me, before my friends you would stand amazed to think what she said, and how she hath acted. Before we returned home, Letters were come for her by the Post, as she had ordered them, (but they were dictated by her self, and writ at a Scriveners Shop in this City by the servant, as he will justify now and well remembers) By that time we got to my Fathers, they were brought her; she opened them and read them with great seeming joy for the good news, and then I took and read them. These Letters upon the dis∣covery of her she burned; the contents whereof I can well remember, and will briefly set down. One was from—Hamond her Governes Directed on the Superscription thus, A Maddam Maddam Henrietta Maria de Wolway; wherein she wrote after her respects and salutes to her Ladyship, and joy to hear she was safe arrived in England, and what longing desires they all had to be with her, to wait on her Ladyship and kiss her hand, How that the old Count was almost mad for her, and the Emperours Nephew likewise: and that they made great search for her. And that the Emperour had sent to the French Court, and would speedily send to England, therefore desired her Ladyship to keep very private: And how her pretty Page (which she said was Mine Heere Breants Son the Emperours Privy-Counsellor) thought it very long, and was very de∣sirous to be with her Ladyship to do his Duty. And such like matter was contained in her Letter. The other Letter was as from Mine Heere Breant as she called him, who was her great friend and Agent in her flight; and as she told us ask∣ing her what he was, She said, He was one of the Emperors Privy-Coun∣sellors, and that her Governess and some of her servants lay at his house for privacy, and he could fetch what he would out of her own house and not be mistrusted being so great with the Emperour. In this Letter, after his great respects and service to her Honour, he informs her, of the receipt of her Letter and of her desire to have the mony returned, which he saith he thought not convenient to venter, and the rather because he did intend to set saile speedily for he had kept a Ship on purpose a whole week, ex∣pecting a good wind, and then he and his Lady, and her Governess, and her servants with her goods, Jewells and moneys, would come over to her.
He informs her also, how that the Emperour mightily checked the holy Fathers for being too rigid and severe, and that he was much troubled for her: He informs her also, what things he had got out of her house, and desired her commands speedily by a Letter what other things she would have: And so after a long Epistle to this purpose, he takes leave of her Ladyship, desiring her to be satisfied that all things shall go well by her Servant his meanes, &c. The other Letter, wherein the other two were enclosed, was sent to Mr. King, which I will insert here word for word. The Superscription thus, For Mr. William King at the Sign of the Royal Exchange in the Poultry nigh Cornhil, London these. Sir, BY the information of my Ladys Letter, she is greatly oblidged to you, and so are we her friends also, I hope your just friendship will conti∣nue, till we her friends do wait on her, where she is. And know Sir, for what obligations you may do her, she is so grateful to retaliate for the least of favours, and that shall be also acknowledged, By Sir, Your ready servant though at present unknown, Wilhalme Breaut. I pray deliver this enclosed to the honorable my Lady. April 10th 1663. Here Gentlemen by him that made me, you have the exact Copy of this Letter, which you may see if you are curious and desirous to do, of him to whom it was directed. Pray mind this Letter, and see how cun∣ningly she indited this and also the other two, of which you have the true contents though short. In the Superscription of this last received Letter, because (as she told me her self) it should not be known to her friends that she lay in a publick house, she left out the word Tavern. In the Letter pray observe those words, For what obligations you may do her &c. That was a Bait for Mr. King, if her hooke had not caught me. In brief, thus you see the Devils Policy. And now Ladies, I wish I could leave her here, for I am even tyred with going so far. I could wish her Coach (which she said my Lord Taff bought for her in England, and sent it over to her, made of the new fa∣shion with Glasse very stately, and her Pages and Lacquies were of the same Livery) was come for me, which after the receipt of these Letters she sent an express order for with other things. I shall be so out of breath before I get to Church with her, she being so big as you see here she is, that I shall not be able to speak (or at least willing to say) I John
take thee &c. especially for bad or for worse, for good or for better, I could strain my self very much. As she is I dare not promise you to heave at her hole, I meane to have and to hold her; for she may go when and where she please. These excellent Chimaera Letters have somewhat raised my fancy to a private smile, and for the present have much diverted my serious humor. But, I hope Ladies you will excuse this diversion of my fancy, and pardon these Jocks the rather, because variety hits the humor of every person, and the more parts I make the more pleasant it is. Sometime after this we joyned hands in Matrimony; and my Religion makes me stand amazed, to think of the corrupted and sinful soul of this miserable Creature. First in violating the Lawes of holy Matrimony, which signifies and represents the Mystical union between Christ and his Church. How will this defiled member answer that dreadful Charge and Position which is used in the Ceremony of Matrimony by the Priest, in these words, saying, I require and charge you (as you will answer at the daeadful day of judgment, when the secreets of all hearts shall be disclosed) That if either of you do know any Impediment why you may not be law∣fully joyned togather in Matrimony, that ye confess it; For be ye well assured, that so many as be coupled togather otherwise then Gods word doth allow, are not joyned togather by God, neither is their Matrimony lawful—I will not stand to apply this, The world is sensible how un∣lawful hers was; And I am satisfyed how clear I am from her, and how free I am in my Conscience, as well from the breach of that Charge, as to enter into that Sacred Order again. But this is between God and my own Conscience, and I will say no more to it. Heaven made this match, but did cut off the entaile of future comfort, else my Judgment failes. As to the several Passages after Marriage, my modesty commands pri∣vacy, to the objections that have been or drollingly can be made, I do not desire, nor will I publish, but privately I can satisfy any rationable person what an artificial made she was, whose seeming purity of a true Maiden Bride, was sophisticated and made strict by the power of Druggs & help of Art. As to the cloths she speaks of, I am certain I left her bet∣ter then I found her, as many can justify, besides that which she had un∣known to me made away. I continued and lived with her about a fort∣night after Marriage before she was discovered; In which time some persons of quality that were curious to see her, did visit us at our Lodg∣ings, and after a considerable stay and time of satisfying their cursosities
and making a Tryal, departed with great credit and belief of her worth. She still continued in her former pretences of Birth and Fortune, and when she was better habited she did better represent. After marriage, during the time I remained with her, my expences on her was as high as her pretences. She, the nobler to entertain those persons of quality her friends who she said were coming over, was very willing and earnest with me to fit her with a noble House; But for the present I satisfyed her with handsome Lodgings, Cloaths and sufficient attendance. But as to this it concerns my self, and is the least thing I care for; it is done, and what I have expended on her, though it be very considerable, yet it is not material to insert for any ones satisfaction. The Counterfeit Jew∣ells, like the rest of her storys and her self, are scarce worth taking off from a Dunghill. These with other things of value, as she said, she had hid about her, she only told me of for a great while, and she said, she would not produce them, that it might be said to her friends when they came over, and to all the world also, that I loved her nobly, and not for what she had; This I protest was her Plea to me. As to Money, I here attest I never saw 10 s. of hers in my life, but she was extraordinary free of my Pocket. I will not insist here, I thought not to speak of it all, for I would have scorned it, but that she hath given out such cursed reports of what things she brought to me; And to speak very much within com∣pass, I am confident all the counterfeit Rings, Jewels and gilded brasse∣wyre worked Bracelets, counterfeit Pearls (which the night she was dis∣covered she thought to Coxeme with still) as you shall read hereafter) her Cloaths, which was the disguise she came in and no other, nay and put her soul in also, if she hath any, for a grain of allowance, are not worth a Collation of Ten pieces. I am brief in every particular, give me leave to smile at one or two passages, which I will contract and insert here, before I leap over many transactions during the fortnights time, and come to the discovery of this disguised Curtizan. Upon a rumor of some vulgar heads that were talking of the Marriage, who credibly repor∣ted that she was a Princess, and what danger the young Gentleman that married her was in, I sometime after I had heard this talk, when it came in my mind, smiling at the conceit began to tell it her for news, which she seemed to start at, as if it had been true. Upon that, Madam said I, Prethe relate to me the truth of your Birth and Fortune Good or bad; for I am bound to stand to it now. She replyed, That she desired me not press her to it, that I might truly attest I knew not what she was, but that I loved her as she was. But, said she, this satisfaction I will give you, I
am nigh related to the Crown of Denmark, let that suffice with what I told you before, and I protest I ever told you the least of what I am. Had I been a Boy, said she, I should have had the Earldom, which was 24000 pounds per annum, which for lack of Issue Male, went to the Emperour who hath 6000 li. of mine in his hands now. But said she, my Father dy∣ing without Heir Male, I only enjoy what he purchased, which is but 3000 li. per annum, as I told you and that is in your English Cint 1500 li. sterling, besides Monys, Goods and Jewells of the Lord my Father and my Lady Mother of a very great value. But to be short, the other passage is this, Her Father in Law the Lord Fidler, the morning before she was discovered, (as I have heard but relate it not for a very truth, though I am apt to believe it by reason he told me & others that he was in Town at that time and long before) with some other of hs Consorts, came early to our lodgings with their musick to play us up. She rose, slipt on a morning Gown of mine: and taking mony of me, which sum I will in∣sert, it was half a piece besides what addition I suppose she made, and presently flung it out of the Bellcony, and after a Tune or two they de∣parted. I could not mistrust any thing then (though I asked her the rea∣son of her freeness? And indeed in all her expences whilst with me, she passed the bounds of Liberality, and touched the Confines of Prodigali∣ty, a thing nothing profitable to any condition, especially a married life: but I then did impute it to the liberality of her disposition and breeding. (She replyed, There were 4 or 5 of them, she could not do lesse in honour, neither did I value it) For it was to be expected in some nature, and she alwaies, both before and after Marriage, when we went forth, was free to servants and very Charitable to the poor, with good admonitions likewise to them. I will not stand to relate any further, how many Pa∣ter-nosters, Aves salves and Creeds she said over, and how strict an ob∣server she did pretend to be of the times: as on Good-fryday night, she would not go to Bed, she said, but be at her Devotion: and how she cros∣sed every up she drank out of, and every Dish of meat, and accompa∣nied every word of her Grace with a Cross inform of Benediction, & such like seeing great zeale. I omit many serious, some excellent humored actions between us and others; and now we will take Coach to visit some Relations, and as we go along, we will call and see them to whom I owe my Duty. After some stay there, She tells me She would have 10 li. to go to Mr. Kings and redeem a Diamond Ring of 80 li. price that she left with him before Marriage for 7 li. in money, and also be∣cause she being a stranger would not be mistrusted that she might do them
wrong, and might carry any thing away with her when she went in her disguise to recreate her self in the fields, with which by walking sometimes with me and some others she became acquainted and knew the way, wherefore she left that for security, with the obligation of privacy; and therefore desired me and my friends to take no notice to him of such a thing. The money she had, and we went and my Mother with us, to see a friend near Mr. Kings house; She and I went to Mr. Kings, I meet∣ing with a friend there, retired into a room to drink a Glasse of Wine, She said, she would go and ask Mr. King for the Ring. A little after she came to me again, and told me, he was so busy he could not give it her now, but desired her to come the next morning or any other time. The next morning she said she would go. So we departed thence, and went to my friends house where we had left my Mother. And here Reader she is discovered; for Mr. King sends presently for my Mother to show her a Letter that came from Dover, in answer to a Letter sent at Rivers by a friend of ours to a friend of his, which Lettet they just were reading as we went into the house, but told me nothing of it, neither did they give her any notice of it until my Mother returned again. A true copy of the Letter I will here insert. Dover, May the 4th. 1663. SIr, This morning I received your Letter, dated May the 2d. instant, and accordingly have made inquiry; By what I can discover, it is a Gentlewoman that is the greatest Cheat in the World. She hath now two Husbands living in this Town, the one a Shoemaker named Thomas Steadman, the other a Chirurgion named Thomas Day. She was borne in Canterbury, her maiden name is Mary Modders, her Father was a Musi∣cian belonging to Christ-church Canterbury. She was lately in Dover-Castle a Prisoner, taken out of a ship bound for the Barbadoes, where she cheated the Mr. of 50 li. if it be she, I am sorry for your friends misfortune. If I shall refer you to Mr. John Williams his Wife, who liveth near St. Saviours Dock New-staires near Rederiff, she is the Masters wife of the Barbadoes ship; and if you can prevaile with her to go see her, she will give you full satisfaction whether it be she or no. I pray you send me a line of the appearance of the business, and the mans name that is married to her, and his Calling; for it is reported A Minister took her up at Gravefend. My respects to your self and Fa∣ther, I remain, Your Loving Friend Mr. King having read this to my Mother, and the rumour by one
means or another being spread, it happened, there was a Gentlewoman then in the house, that hearing of it, did mistrust it was the same person that formerly lay at her house, at the back-side of the Feathers Taverne in Pauls Church-yard; where she had like to have married a Mercer in Pater-noster-row, but was discovered before it was quite compleated. The same Gentleman I understand she hath cheaed of a very considera∣ble sum in Silks and Sattin. This Gentlewoman desired my Mother to permit her to go and see her. When they came into the room at my friends house wher we were, as soon as she had cast her eye upon the Gentlewoman, she put on her Hoods and hid her Face. I wondered who she was that came up. My Mother asked her, If she knew this Mary Moders? She replyed, She knew her by her Gate. Then it was no time to dissemble, and my Mother desired the Gentlewoman to go near her, and look in her Face; for she hid her Face and turned her back towards them, and made as if she looked out at the Window. The Gentlewo∣man went, and looking on her said, How do you Madam? She replyed, I do not  now you. No Madam, did not you ly so long at my house? & such like proofs she brought. She still replyed, I never saw you before. In brief the Gentlewoman would have swore it was the same person, and she departed. By and by her husband came, but she would not let any one come up to see her; but he by description knew her also, and told s some other former Cheats. When she was gone they shewed me the former Letter, which I read to her, and asked her if she was such a person? she utterly denyed it, and protested she was not. And I pro∣test the imagination of this misfortune gave me such a terrible Charge, that I could hardly recover my right sense; but to try her the better, I then bid her give me her Jewels off. She would not consent to it a great while, at length she did, I sent them by two friends to the Gold∣smith, which when he looked on them, he wondred at their question, which was to know what they were? She had a Ring likewise she pro∣tested cost 50 li. which I sent after the rest, and they were all false, and worth nothing but the Gold, which will hardly purchase a gallon of Ca∣ary; finding things thus, we did believe the aforesaid Letter and wit∣nesse. So we desired her to give us seven of the ten pounds she had just before, and we would redeem the Ring she said Mr. King had: So re∣ceiving the mony of her (she being unwilling to part from it at first till she see we found her out very plainly) we went for the Ring, which made Mr. King amazed at the question, for never any such thing was; But ere ay her plot, she the morning before said, She would go to my Fa∣thers,
and it seems carryed a great bundle out with her that I knew not of, to a place I know not where, and after called there where she said she would; so she thought being provided with the 10. l. in silver, be∣sides several pieces of Gold she had of me the same time, the Cloaths I bought, her Ring, Picture and Watch she had of me, and other things; she imagined her self in a good Equipage for another designe and a speedy flight. After this discovery, my Relations and my self pressed hor to speak true, whether she had any other Husband, and told her how little regard we had to her pretended Fortune, and that if she could Vindicate and prove her honesty (which upon their attestation was justly feared) she should live happily and contentedly with me that loved her nobly and heartily; and there she presently (though we could not make her speak before) fell down on her knees in the presence of several persons, weeping exceedingly; wished for a suddaine judgment to befall her, and that her soul may eternally hang in Hell, if ever she was Contracted, Mar∣ryed to, or knew any man besides my self. Upon this I prevailed with my Friends (who advised me to secure her there all night) to let her have her desire, and go home with me to our Lodgings; when we came home she presently undressed her self, and slipt on the Indian Gown, and having put on clean Linnen and Gloves, and such things, she pulled off the Rings from her fingers, and Christals from her ears, and her Bracelets all Counterfeit, and gave them me, desiring me when she was dead, not to let the Rings in her ears be taken out, nor her Gloves off her hands, and such like foolish desires: I wondred at her fancy, and asked her why she talked of dying; Madam said I, do you mean to do your self a mis∣chief; No Sir said she to do my self good, before to morrow morning you shall see me in another Condition; hearing this and such like discourse, the Man and Maid standing in the Chamber, I commanded them not to stir thence that night, but to fetch me such and such things, for I would sit up my self also. Then she opened a Paper of Counterfeit Pearl, and gave me a couple, saying, These my Dear will make you amends for all: Within halfe an hour after, my Father and Mother, Sister, and another Gentlewoman came with a Shooe-maker that was sent by the aforesaid Mrs. Williams, men∣tioned in the Letter to Mr. Kings to know the truth of this: When he came there, my Friends told him she was gone with me to our Lodgings, and notwithstanding it was so late at Night, and Rained, and he had as far as Horsly-Down to return home, yet he came with my Friends in a Coach, whom he desired not to leave me alone with her if they loved me,
but to stay themselves all-night. When he came into the Room, he asked her how she did doe? she replyed as she did before, and alwayes doth in the like Cases, that she did not kun-now him; he replyed, you impudent Woman, do not you know you owe me so much money for Slops and Shooes when you lay at Mrs. Williamses, she will know you to morrow morning, and I beleive will go neer to tear thee to peices, you know you owe her 44 l. and then began to jeer her and said what a P—makes you so fine in this brave silk Gown, I cannot maintaine my Wife so, and I am a Master-Shooe-maker, and your Husband T. S. a Journey∣man-Shooe-make, and such like slouts he used and so departed, earnest∣ly desiing us not to leave her alone, or stir from her, for she will cheat the Divel himself she hath so many tricks. In this Dress she sat all Night on the Bed-side, and would not speak one word, aske her what you will, and that is her trick upon all discoverys; but let any one back her, and she will speak as boldly as a Divel. About the middle of the Night my Friends and asked her if she would eat or drink a glass of Wine, or any thing else? she replyed to me safely, yes, she would eat, and desired me to bring her a Knife, vvhich vvhen she had got, I think she had eat nothing, but she put the Knife in her Pocket; by and by she pulled out the Dravves of my Trunk, and took ou her Letters, and de∣sired the Candle of me, set them on fire vvithin the Curtaines, & vvhen they vvere flaming, flung them on the ground. I shall pass over many things she did say to me, hovv dearly she loved me, and longed to be vvith me alone, and vvhen I asked her any thing to press her to the truth she vvould, for indeed she could say nothing, but seemed to deny it still. In the morning about 4 of the Clock, she took an opportunity vvhen my Father vvas in the Dineing Room a reading, my Sister, the other Gentleman and my self lying on the Bed in a slumber, and only my Mo∣ther sitting by her at the fire side, she cast her eye tovvards the Chamber door, and the light appearing on the Stair-head, my Mother feared she vvould run ovvn and get avvay, and therefore vvent to the Stairs and stood there; she seeing this opportunity, drevv out my svvord that lay on the Chimney-piece, and run as fast up Staires as she could possibly, vvhich being perceived, some one cryed out she vvas gone up vvith a Svvord, and vvith that vvaked me, and I taking the boys svvord, follovv∣ed her up, calling to her to forbear, vvhich I beleive I need not have done, for she vvould have been hanged before she vvould have hut her self; vvhen I came up I found her leaning as it vvere vvith her breast open on the svvords point, took hold of the svvord and brought her
dovvn againe; and she told me, but that shee heard my voyce, and desired to speak with me, else she would have killed her self. The day grovving farther on, vve bid her provide and put on her ovvn Cloaths, for Mrs. Williams and the rest of the Witnesses vvould come presently, vvhich she did though unvvillingly, and cryed very much, and desired to speak vvith privatly me in the next room, vvhere she used many protestations of her Love to me, & sorrow for the abuse she had done me, and begged of me to let her escape, and she would never see England more; I answered her I will, for all this abuse, show you all the Civility I can, and if I can be cleared from you and your actions, you shall go as you please; till then, we must proceed according to Law and Justice; you see what Witnesses come against you, and how reports encrease; and I cannot with safety to my self let you escape; and said I, what will the world think of it, if I should? therefore I must publsh it now, that they may see the wrong you have done me, or else they will wonder at the reason, and think I have abused you. Some time after Mrs. Williams, and many others that knew her came, and were ready to tear the Cloaths off from her back; and Mrs. Williams challenging a Scafe that she had on, Moders replyed, Indeed Mrs. Williams it is none of yours, for this I lately bought, and there are all the words she spoke in answer to any ones accusations, only she cryed very much all the while, and talked to me privately, and beg'd me to let her escape for Gods sake, and she was hear∣tily grived she had abused me that was so lovng and civil, and that she loved me Cordially, and with all her soul which I could hardly beleive; for if she had, she would not have abused me, as I then told her; but intreat her never so earnestly and much, she would not tell me why she did so, nor speak one word to that, only weep and say that she should dye if we prosecuted her; but she would hant some bodys Ghost, and such Bugbear storys she would use, thinking to terrefie me, and so to let her escape. You may imagine Gentlemen and Ladys what a damp it struck to my spirits to see this suddain alteration; I could not withdraw my affection, though her actions forced me to do what I did. Presently after in a strange manner, the rumour being aboad there came the Gen∣tlewoman that lved over against our Lodging, in whose House she lodg∣ed with Mr. Day▪ and with her came her Bride Maid, and others of Mr. Days acquaintance and Relations, and with strange Exclamations did even Curse her and her actions; so many Witnesses appearing together, we all (near a score in number) went back to the Justices, who after se∣veral Examinations, justly committed her, she being asked her name,
would not declare it, nor nothing else. The Glark being about to make a Mittius, she desired me for God sake not to let it be to Newgate, my affection not being extirpated, I was willing to perform any civil request still, though I must confess I did deserve, and justly was blamed by many Strangers, that I did so much un-man my self; for I am certain, had it been some mens case, she had not breathed long after; but it is best as it is, I had more Charity for her, and Civility to her then she did de∣serve; My thinks it should pierce her heart when she seriously consi∣ders of her abuses and discourtesie to me, yet my civility always to her. But Curteous Reader, I have been pretty long and very plain in re∣lating the discovery of her, and the rather, by reason it was so strange, and because every person is very inquisitive in this point. The reason why she so earnestly entreated me not to let her go to Newgate, was because she hath been there before, and lay in a miserable Condition there in the Common Goale a great while, and would had been well known there; For an Exchange woman, to whom this Moders oweth some money, for which she was in Newgate, to satis∣fie the desire of the Fore-man of the Jury, Mr. Rutland, who would not beleive but that she was what she pretended her self to be; after her Tryal, being at the Keeper of Newgate's House, went with some others to see her, she then standing in the Belcony of the Keepers House, seeing the little Gentleman come into the Yard, run presently away and locked her Chamber Door to her, and though they Feed the Keepers, yet could not procure Admittance; For she told the Keepers through the Door, that that little Gentleman should not come in; then the Fore-man desired her to admit him in, who had done her a late great Curtesie as to saving her Life, she answered, he should be admitted without his Company; the Jury-man replyed in briefe, Madam I understand you owe this Gentle∣man my Friend some moneys, she replyed Yes, but he must go to her Husband for it, but which of her Husbands, I cannot tell; For I cannot imagine whose Wife she will be at the Resurrection, and the debt must remain till then, and there we shall have true Justice done without fa∣vour or respect to any person, and therefore we will let that rest and sleep quietly in the U. But now we will leave her at the Gate-house, where if any person came that knew her as many scores did, she will own none; and to strangers she still carrys on a design to procure Friends and money under her former pretences, and here she remained sporting with, and Courted by the young Gallants of this age, who either wil∣fully or ignorantly beleive her still; but the Civilized Gentry (though
Gentility cannot be termed properly without Civility) did after a little satisfaction of their curiosities perceive her Craft and Impudence; nay I protest I have heard I may say hundreds of my friends, acquaintance and accidental company, that have and do in their discourse, confess she hath a notable cunning and flashy wit, but a very Bawd to all lewdness and vice, and (in the Term all the World almost gives her) a Damn'd Whore. And sundry persons of great quality and Estates, and good Conscience, wonder she is permitted to breath, and that she should be so upheld in her villany; but she will shortly smell odious, and perish miserably; For Est natura hominum novitatis avida. The greatest fault of our English Nation, as is the doom and sentence of other Countrys of us. Her passages there are not unknown to many hundreds, and there∣fore I will fobear to nsert any here. Two dayes after her commitment, being Fryday the eighth of May last past, for, a diversion and satisfaction of my mind, I went down to Canterbury, where unknown to any who I was, upon discourse of such a person I heard of her damnable actions, and wondered to hear the cursed exclamations that very many persons made against her. Finding things, so true, after a little stay there, the Gentleman that accompanied me and my self, we went to the worthy Gentleman Frances Lovelace, now Recorder of Dover and Canterbury, whose civility he very readily ex∣pressed to us, by satisfying our Queries. He informed us also of a former Tryal before him at Dover: and that Justice had been then executed on her life, but that the Power being then usurped, and in the hands of the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parlament, they were unwilling to execute their Commissions to the full by reason of the aforesaid Power that gave them; And at that time they passed by many great and criminal faults at all Courts in England, excepting Murder. And that if he recovered his health (being then dangerous ill) his occa∣sions would call him up to London, and then he would assist us suffici∣ently in our business, whom we did daily expect and depend somewhat on; but his sickness continuing he was prevented. After we returned to London, upon a Letter sent to the aforesaid Esquire Lovelace, he re∣turned this answer, which is a true Copy, some private things in answer to our requests only left out, as being not material nor concerning the business. Sir, I received your Letter, and according to your request, have sent you the Indictment against Mary Molers, and her own Examination ta∣ken before the Mayor and Jurats of Dover, whereby you may receive
good light. Her first husband Thomas Steadman is yet living, and a Souldier in Dover Castle. Upon the tryal of life and death, she was found not guilty by the Jury; and though her Examination will be no evidence against if she deny it, yet by that you have instruction to prove her first marriage to Steadman. The Town-Clark of Dover cannot be at London. I am yet so ill that I dare not venter to go to London; yet it will be very necessary for you to prove her first marriage to Steadman, which you may do if you send a Witness down that can write and read, to see the Church-Book of St. Mildrids Parish in Canterbury, or the Register Office there; and to take a Copy thereof, and be able to swear it to agree with the Original. There is one that lives in or near Canterbury, that I am in∣formed was present at her first marriage to Steadman, and gave her to him in Marriage, he may be had to London to be a witness. And I would have yours that you send down, go to Dover and see Thomas Steadman, and be able to prove him to be living. I doubt not but you can prove her Marriage to the Gentleman your friend, and a Witness that knows her, and your work will be done. Yours, &c. And according to this Gentlemans advice we not only proceeded but exceeded. For in order to her Tryal which was on the 4th day of June last, at Justice-hall London, first, we brought him up who did testify he her in Marriage to Tho. Steadman, & did answer all the objections that gave the Court did several times make to him. As to the Register none was ever Recorded, through the negligence of the former Clarke of St. Mildrids Parish, But the Register-book was strictly perused by two Gentlemen that wen down for Witnesses, and also the Clark now in being, who said the former Clark did seldom or never Register any Mar∣riage, & also that it was a rare thing to state a Wedding at the Church; As to a Witness he advised us to send down some that could write and read; There did for better security two persons of good repute go on purpose, who did speak with the said Thomas Steadman, and one of the aforesaid Gentlemen with James Knot, whom they carried from Canterbury to Dover, to testifie that Steadman was living, did also see & accompanied Mr. Day the other husband. They both acknowledged their Marriages, & the said Steadman confessed he had two children by her, both dead; and that James Knot (who was then present) gave her in Marriage. He would willingly came against her; and when we sent a Letter for him after∣wards, he returned an answer, he could not without leave from the Go∣vernour who was then in London, or the Ensign of the Castle who came with her to Gravesend, and lodged with her (as many in Canterbury said)
To which Governor, I am informed by a Gentleman that knows the pro∣ceedings, she sent a Letter from the Gate-house, desiring mans apparrel for her escape: and that if they let Steadman come up, when she was dead she would haunt them. And thereupon Steadman was not per∣mitted to go out of the Castle; but was secured by strict order from the Governor, that rod Post down or sent on purpose, who protested to secure him in chains before he should come up; at this instant we under∣stand from Canterbury he remained so kept up. As to a witness that knew her Sarah Williams was sworne, who attested that this woman was bound for Barbadoes, to go along with her Husband, and she desired to Lodge at her house for a time, and did so. And when the Ship was ready to go, she went into Kent to receive her means, and said she would meet the Ship in the Downs, and missing the Ship took Boat and went to it. After some days, there came her husband Thomas Steadman with an Order, and fetcht her a shore, she sending him a Letter, that she was well stored with Monys and other things, and therefore desired him to fetch her away per force, and carried her to Dover Castle. But I will be short in this relation, for her favourable Tryal is well known, and her preamble and altogether imaterial Plea she made at the Bar, and the Witness she was allowed, and the Councel that she had privatly ordered and provided to prompt her. As to Mr. Days Marriage we had 5 or 6 Witnesses ready; but I know not how, nor why the Indictment was not took notice of. As to her Marriage with Mr. Billing the Brick∣layer, he was in the Court, and did declare it to many scores there; the Parson that married him, and the Clark that gave her to him, were there also, and this Indictment was thrown away unregarded. His daughter al∣so who had lodged with this Mary Monster alias Moders, did testifie she was her Fathers Wife, but she utterly hated her. Notwithstanding this Indictment was not minded; what the reason was I leave to every Christian to Judg of her; my green years do not afford me Wisdom e∣nough to see into it. In proving her Marriage to Steadman, the Copy of the Indictment and the Records were offered to the Court, but were termed Pamphlets, and not looked on or read. It would he to tedious, to recite the full Copy of her examination and Tryal she had at Dover; But in short thus it was, she owned and confessed her self to be Mary Moders daughter of William Moders, late of Canterbury deceased; but called her self, and was Indicted by the name of Love Maria Moders. She acknowledged and confessed she was married to The. Steadman of the City-of Canterbury Cordweiner,
Owned her Marriage to Mr. Day, which was proved; but she pleaded Not guilty, because she said Thomas Steadman her husband was gone a Souldier o Dukirk; and she was told by a Souldier that came thence that he dyed there. The aforesaid James Knot proved her Marriage to Stedman on this Tryal at Dover. The Jury (after directions given them by the Judge) found her not Guilty, upon which it was thus ordered. Dover ss. At a general Sessions of the Peace and Goale-delivery, holden there on Thursday the 26 day of April 1660 before ho Brown, Esq Mayor of Dover, Tho. Sidenham, Tho. Day, Luke Brailsford & John Bryan Jurats. The Court doth Orer Love Maria Moders, otherwise called Mary Steadman, to fina Sureties to be of good behaviour, and to appear here at the next General Sessions; and in the mean time, she is to forbear to ac∣company with Tho. Day Chirurgion as his wife, unless (in the mean time) she brings a sufficient Certificate that Tho. Steadman is dead. And Tho. Day is to keep her till next Sessions, unless she brings a Certificate Stead∣man is dead. A true Copy examined by John Pepper Town-Clark of Dover. Here was Justice Gentlemen, and I am informed that she did not ap∣pear at the next Sessions; for it was thought she needed not, by reason that Steadman, who at her Tryal absconded (as on the lae Tryal on my behalf, He was strictly secured against his will or) desire, for as he said, God did never prosper him since he denyed to come against so wicked a Creature) did afterwards return, being at that time by her means and Fees hid in the County of Kent till after her Tryal; and it being so apparent, as in my Case it is likewise, the Bech was troubled no further with the matter. But by the Law of God, Nature and Reason, Mr. Day gave Steaman his wife. But before Steadmans appearance, Mr. Day was Arresed (as it is her treacherous design to serve me so if possible, by which very design the world may know what she is) he came to Tryal, and justly cast the Plaintiff with cost and dam∣ages allowed; bringing sufficient proof by other Witnesses, as I also can produce upon occasion, That she had a husband living when she was married to Mr. Day in London (which marriage was both strange and suddain, for Mr. Day, a person well struck in years, meeting her at Gravesend, both coming to London, She by her hypocritical deluding carriage and soothing speeches did pocure that affection of him, and so charmed his very soul to her, that he forthwith married her, (she then pretending to be a rich Widdow of the County of Kent) for she is
Omnium Scenarum Mulier, a woman for all parts) within two or three dayes after this accidental acquaintance) but because Steadman could not be produced upon her Tryal at Dover, she saved a stretching till a∣nother time. And after this Tryal, wherein Mr. Day cast the Plainti, he was troubled no further with her; but did presently after, and still so remains, married to a Gentle woman he formerly Courted and was pro∣mised to. Neither will I (Courtious and judicious Reader) admit of any further trouble with her, though I can hardly break ost here, and let so many, to true and material Passages, Relations and Circumstances (which might be further evidence against her false pretences and monste∣rous lyes) pass unregarded. a full Narrative of whose innumerable cur∣sed actions would fill a Volumn of the best part of 500 quires; But I am satisfyed that the world shall know thus much, which is but the ab∣stract and abridgment of some part of her late acted Cheat on me. I am sufficiently tyred with, her, not only in suffering and bearing the burden of her abuses: but also in relating what I here have done in Quarto, Epitomized as I may properly say. I would had willingly made a brief∣er Narration, fearing the prolixity of this discourse (wherein I am forced to be my own Historiographer, through my desire to Allegiance and Truth) might not prove savory; But I hope it will be rather grateful then disgustful to every Christian Spectator. I might recount many more passages, and proceed further with her, and tell you, How after she removed from Newgate, she took Lodgings in Fullers Rents in Grayes-Inne, In which Inns of Court I know not how or why admit∣ted (but I am sure detected, hated and neglected by all the Civil and In∣genious Gentlemen of that honourable house and society.) She hath pro∣cured and retained a grand Counsellor of the Law to be her Tutor, and she is his Pupil, where she admits of no Vacation; But keeps Hillary Term altogether. And I would advise all such as shall desire to try a Title with her, if their evidence be good and sound, to secure it by all means, and rather compound then join Issue with her and proceed to Tryal: for the Devil and the Frenchman are on her part, and many have almost lost their Evidence; and though I did venter a Tryal, I am sure I am come off with Costs and Damages notwithstanding I brought suffi∣cient Evidence, which (Thanks to the Judg of Heaven and Earth is as perfect and sufficient still. I understand also, she is a great Student of Astrology, and very, very, very often lyes a Star-gazing; and she her self represents the true Effigies and shape of Ursa Major, Anglice, the great Bear. She hath much practise in that way, and takes great delghit in the
Conjunction of Mars & Venus: The Sign with her is in Scorpio, and I would advise her to Invoak Gallen to look to her Secrets: or else I am certain her Comical heat will scortch, if not set fire on the Meridian of the Micro-cosme or little World of many a Gentleman; for whose ad∣monition I have (though unwillingly, by reason of the insuitability with my present calamity, and also this solid discourse) modestly wrapt up this Cave. But to return, I say I might insert many passages, and amongst the rest her Epistles she sent to me since her Tryal; and you might there∣in see the soothing adulation and Sycophantick expressions, she still, under the pretence of affection, sollicites and pursues me with, to be∣tray my person the next opportunity she can get: Styling me Dear Sir, My Dear, my Heart, my Love, my dearest Self, and telling me, what a sad, heavy and bleeding heart she hath, by reason she doth not en∣joy me, and that she tenders me more then the Apple of her eye; And up∣on my just suspicion of her treachry, wha Paotestations she used, and how highly, she expressed her self, saying, I might be confident of my safe∣ty, she would rather dye, nay the Heavens and Earth shall ceaese to be no more, before she would betray me her dearest Love; and therefore, Pray my dear heart let me be so happy as to see you, &c. But no: never expect to see me more, I'le not degrade my self to see a Where. I know thee now, thy Teares, thy Parts, thy Prayers Were the chief motives, brought me in these snaires. 'Tis you, vile Woman, you I say, have mov'd Me to abhorr, thee, whom I dearly lov'd; Who would had thought, that thou so base wouldst prove Under pretence of zeal, and earnest love? Or that such monstrous treachery should find Room, in a seeming brave Coelestial mind. Perfidious Woman, would'st thou still deceive? And by thy flat'ring Charms make me believe? I'le trust no further. Now I know most sure They are most subtil who do seem most pure. Therefore Farewell, thy wordes and teares are vaine To Court my stay, 'tis that will breed my paine. Thus, gentle Reader, you see the troubled Seas of my misfortunes Ebbs and Flows, with the various Imaginations of present and future
successes; and the method of my writing here represents the confused state of my mind. But all I aim at or intend, is only an infallible con∣veyance of the truth of this Come-Tragedy to the world, whose confu∣sion and last act is depending, and threatens much disaster, which I beg of Heavens to prevent on all sides; and I hope the Corroding teeth of time will consume and eat away these late acted storys. But I will pro∣ceed to an end, that I may quickly put an end to my proceedings; I must a little look back upon the tender care this pretty piece of Machiv I hath for me, and see what neat terms of art she useth, as if she had been accustomed to this kind of Courtship; but I fear the recital of those Letters and other material stratagems and designes would be too prolix. I will not stand to tell you, how this pretty Fidlers brat went to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor in mans Apparel, as this Hermophro∣dite told me her self on Sunday the 14th. of June last, when I happened to see her, she being informed where I was walking, came to me, which was the last time I did (and I beleive the last time I shall) ever see her. Before which sight she had sent me a Letter to Court my love and con∣sent to live with her, thinking by her flatterys to gaine my consent, and so get some considerable things of me: As the Cloaths and other valuable things that I gave her to supply her great necessityes, and adore her poverty with, which I thank Fortune I have again, that is, the best part of them, and will keep them perhaps for another, nay give them away to a stranger, rather then to re-bestow them on her Ale tub Lady-ship, whose seeming love still aimes at no∣thing else, but to trouble me; get what she can from me, and so go a∣way, and then she would be fitted for another Cheat. I say she told me she went to his Lordships and showed me the very Cloaths and habit she wore thither, and she makes sport at the (Impudence) humour, and she gives out that her busines was only to return his Lordship thanks for the favour he demonstrated to the Germane Princess his Country-woman, she then represented a Man! I admire at her impu∣dence, but I am apt to think his Honour is ignorant of her actions? nay when I told her of the favour she had at the Bench, she laughed at and made ascoffe of her Favourites, and told me how confident she was to escape had I summoned up a Regiment of Witnesses. And when I ask∣ed her how she lived so high, she replyed she was cryed up for a Wit, and by her Wit Coaxed her Visitors and so get money enough, and if I would live with her, she would be as good as her word; for she would under∣take
to keep and maintaine a Coach and Horses, and made a very scoff of her Benefactors, Whom like a Horse-leach she doth suck and drein As long as they have blood in any Veine. Many other passages I purposely omit and remit all to your discreet opinions, to coment and make private Annotations within your selves, as you revolve the proceedings in your mind, and to sound the intents Ambages, Plots and undermineings of this base vile, detestable, yet cun∣ning Diabolical Infidel. I shall therefore for brevity sake, leave many material Circumstances and passages to remain in the Ink-horne, which I shall hardly open again, unless it be to whet my Pen, and send a Satyr to her to scratch and lash her till the blood comes for her just deserts. And here I set a period, with my hearty wishes of prosperity and better For∣tune to all, I salute you with a Vale. Postscript. Worthy and Ingenious Reader, THese sheets when first begun were intended for the Press; But be∣fore I had proceeded in one quarter of the Narration, upon second thoughts I put a demur to my former intention, and so unperfect they remained scattered and neglected till even now; At length I resolved to go thorough with it, in any careless manner of description, but true mat∣ter, and leave it to be perused by my worthy Friends and acquaintance, only in the original Coppy of my hand writing; and if they were curi∣ous to have it, to transcribe it themselves; but through her much un∣true and abusive Prints, not by her composed, though by her means; and by reason of the earnest desires and entreatys of some Friends, per∣sons of very great quality that had seen, and to whom I read this almost abortive and scarce reviewed work, at whose desires I stood suspended and utterly denyed the permission to print this, until recollecting their satisfactory reasons, and their friendships, I thought my self oblidged and interessed to accomplish their desires since they laid in my power, in communicating this unliked production to the Treasury of the world; and by reason of the prolixity of it, I would not, nor did I give my self
the trouble as to transcribe, much more unwilling to dress it in any bet∣ter language and stile then freely and spontaneously proceeded from my (at this time discomposed) invention; knowing that Nakedness best be∣comes verity, and truth is truth still, though it be ill recounted or dis∣puted. And therefore I condiscended to their desires to publish it, and to my own also in not giving my self further trouble in transcription or alteration. But had I thought it should have been exposed to publick view, it may be expected I should have made a handsomer order and method in the Composure of this too true Narration; wherein it seems to me I have used significant, plain, honest, and true expressions, though neither polite, not politick. My misfortune toucheth me so neer in some points, that I am constrained violently to break forth in despight of my discretion; and I am sorry that I am forced so unhappily to change my stile, that instead of writing of a Friend, nay a nearer Relation a (Quondam) Wife, I must (to relate and set forth the truth) write as of an Apostate and an Adversary. But I am apt to beleive every ingenious Reader will so much resent as to hold me excused, for the feeling affection that attends my expressi∣on, can hardly be conceived, much less delineated and set forth by any. But it cannot sure be pleasing to any to read or hear the disgusts that my oppressed heart endures; I hope it will not be irksome to listen a while to disasters, where Nature is such, that they deprive those of their me∣mory whom they torment; and if in any part of my aforesaid Relation I have exceeded, or not observed a due Decoum, I hope you will impute it to her abusive writings and the aforesaid reason. It is a true saying, secunda cogitationes meliores, second thoughts prove best, for first moti∣ons are not in our hands. And since I have not time now to recollect, accept of and absolve the errors of my first motions; and I presume my Youth may serve to excuse all errors, either in acting this Relation, or in relating their Actions. And here worthy Reader, I would willingly subscribe to this my intended Ultimum Vale, but I am encountred again with another execrable Volumne in Octavo, that goeth under her name, Entituled, The Case of Madam Mary Carleton; wherein, notwithstand∣ing her actions are so well known to the world, which are the truest Idaea of every person, yet her unparalell'd confidence hath permitted the Counterfeit Effigies of her ill-shapen painted face to be inserted as a Prologue, and for a better gloss to the book, whereby she endeavours
to make the world beleive her innocence makes her dare to expose it to view, but Behold her Impudence, after such disgrace, Dares show a Brazen and ignoble face. It seems strange to me that she should be so presumptious (considor∣ing that the world is well satisfied, what and who she is) and it is now generally known that she is the Production of an infamous brood, dropt from an Ale-tap, and the filthy base extraction of a Dunghill; and that she hath been and is a common and confident Curtizen, a Cursed Apo∣state, a Store-nouse of untruths, an Armory of falshoods, a Castle of im∣pudency, a Treasury of Vice, an Enemy to all good, a receit and Exche∣quer of all Roguery, an inventer of Villany, and Blasphemous detractor from all goodness good people, nay even from God himself; and this I protest (with griefe of my soul and pitty for her I relate) is the perfect and true Character of her.) I say I wonder at her presumption in de∣dicating a book, which only beares the name she now owns, to that thrice noble and illustrious Prince Rupert, wherein she abuses (though none can detract from his renowned fame) the Honour of his Highness, by sa∣luteing him with a book, neither beleived or received, and by dedicating to his Honour a piece containing such and so many lyes, only well wrapt up, and by endeavouring to procure his greatness and virtue to be a pro∣tection for her meanness and vice, and in sine by makeing his Honour to be called in question, and to be the table talk of every Vulgar person, they supposing, that his Highness allows and winks at her Vice; which I here declare, I am sufficiently informed is altogether false, though she professed to me that his Highness was daily with her; yet all the pro∣testations she can use, cannot make me beleive she can speak truth; but it is only her great guilt makes her soare so high for Protection; and I am by persons of Honour made to beleive, you shall see a just punish∣ment inflicted on her by his Highness for this her unwarrantable pre∣sumption. But I will not stand to arme my reason by way of defence to every loud Alarum she beats up against me in that most cursed and false Relation written in that book by her dictates; it is better worded then beleived, as all that read it do pass their Verdict, and agree with me in this my short censure, . I have read it, un∣derstood it, and condemned it: For I protest, whosoever beleives and receives that book for truth in the Relation, may as well, nay better be∣leive that the Devil himself never told an untruth; I will not therefore
enlarge here, nor stand to answer, that innumerable and horrible compa∣ny of new invented, prodigious and execrable lyes, which are inserted therein: nor tell the world what wages was allowed to that ingenuous, though: Meciny Pedant, that wrot it for her, and assisted her in con∣triving & etting out those cursed untruths to the best advanatge, in fa∣cious and politick method and style; for let any person peruse the Book, and you may often entrap him in Cnradicting himself, and in the imprbability of the Naation; But you may see now the Devil and his Pimps work together. It is said there, that she would shortly-return homewards and I would advise her so to do, for I know she will be well∣come; And Pluto stands ready big with expectation to receive het, and thinks her absence tedious, for he lacks his Consort. He would rejoyce to see her travelling in Duns Chariot; but perhaps he may pemit her to Whore Errant-ys while, that she may by her impudence be his fa∣mous Agent, and onicle heself to be the lewdest Strumpet of these many ages; and to that end she had best go to Wittenberg (a plae in her pretended ountry) and Comence Bawd. She is sufficiently behold∣ing to eve al persons for thei Fees and Kisses: and all civil persons are now truly sensible of the disgace that accues by accompanying her, who is a poo prostat Cuzan. For my part I am heartily sorry that such a defiled Creatue hath been so near related to me, though now the Law of God and Natue hath Cancelled those Bonds. I hee declare to the Wold, that I neither can or will assist her im∣pudency or cheish he wickedness. She saith she will own me till death dissolve the uion: and I say, I will own her to be a cursed infamous Strumpet and vagabond, till a Haller dissolve the union between her ex∣ecrable soul and polluted body; And I will surrender all my right to her (if I have any) to him that will embrac it Gratis; For though I once loved the Traytor, I ever did and shall hate the Treason, And therefore think it not strange that I am so bitter against her in my writ∣ing, and have upon the sight of her cursed Pamphlets added suc invect∣ive, but tue Epithites to the description of her, in which upon the review of this uncomposed piece, I did insert as Marginal notes, by inteliuing them; For she was the Cause that moved my passion to this effect, not only by that grand abuse she offered to me in acting: but also by those scurulous and untne Prints, lately come forth by her order. It grieved me very much that she doth abuse so many persons of great worth in those ignominious Pamphlets but they are well satisfied that her tongue is no slander. She endeavoureth to ground a belief in the World that
I have a great respect for her, but over-powred; and she will not seem to believe that I wrot the former sheet called my Replication, because I did therein, though very modestly strike upon the galled part of her Acti∣ons, But I would have her know that both that sheet and this also, I do and will own to be Legicimate (be they disliked or approved I care not whether,) for as I am ambitious of no persons applause: so I nei∣ther care for, nor fear any persons rigorous censure especially in a mat∣ter of truth, which by Truth its self, you have nothing else herein inser∣ted for I should, and do scorne to own any thing by subscribing my name to it, that I did not solely compose and compleat myself. And if she moves me further, she shall find I will let her blood in the right Vein, and compleat the whole History of her and her actions, which by my directions and order shall be brought to view. I will (if her impu∣dence stirs further) send her Companions enough,  Satyrs, as she had better have no being then to feel the smart of their sharp wounding lashes. But since the World shall be made acquainted with the truth of the late great noised umour, I can more willingly put a quiem to all passira e grief. For swelling Passion made me to unfold My Grief, which eased will be when 'tis told. And though I suffered so great an injury and abuse by her, I freely forgive her, and shall endeavour to forget both; for Injuriarum re∣medium est oblivio. Oblivion is the best Corrasive for injues. But I will now take my Pen from Paper, and I presume you will absolve my prolixity, for I shall not willingly troube, you again, especially in this Tragical matter and manner. But if ever hereafter, I shall expose any thing of mine to view. I shall endeavour to make you amends for this, by sending somewhat to delight the eys and ears, and tickle the fancy of every Spectator. And therefore worthy Gentlemen and Ladies, I hope for, and beg a charitable construction, that you will ballance all Venial Errors, with my young experience and present discomposedness. And If you seriously reflect on my real de lorable condition, as being brought thereunto, not by my own fault, but by anothers (uheard of) craft m made thus miserable. I know it will warm our Souls to pity, and Chri∣stianity will (I presume) oblidge you, justly to help and assist me upon occasion; & I shall strive to retaliare your Courtesies & goodness by my gratitude, and ready service to you all, to whose maturer discernments and Christian Judgments; I here humbly offer my care, for it is a max∣im in Law, Neo debet esse Judex in propria Causa. No person ought to be Judg in his own Case.
I humbly conceive I may promise to my self a full Verdict; and that you will find her Guilty, and so clear me from any just concernes with such a monstrous Creature; and though my Stars have not been very propitious to me, & things have succeded contrary to my expectation, I will endeavour to fortifie my self against my present conflict and agonys and if once Heaven brings me out of this Labirinth (which I heartily pray for) I hope my joy and contentmt may arrive to that pass my discon∣tents have brought me, and may be freed from the anguish that at present possesseth me; and that the Sunne-shine of Gods delightful Consolati∣on, may break through, and for ever discipate the black Clouds of de∣spaire, and that I may not walk in Nubibus but openly, and appear to show my hearty thanks and open soul (which I wear Charactered in my brow) to all judicious persons and my worthy Friends, and my love even to my very Enemys; and thus I leave you to him that made all things, wishing and praying for Internal, External, and Eternal joy and prospe∣rity to my Soveraign Lord the King and his Kingdoms, and to the Loyal Subjects of this my Native Country, and to my right noble and worthy Relations, and to that Honourable right Noble and learned society, (whereof I am an unworthy member) and to all those ingenious Gentle∣men my friends and acquaintance therein, which is the Ultimum Vale of a highly abused Christian; and as it is well observed they are subject to evil, whose vertuous life least deserves it; but it is better to be passive and suffer, then actve and do any injuriocs evil. And here I cast An∣cho, being arrived to a wished end, the happy Haven of my present de∣sires. Qui non est hodie Cras magis Valete Aptus erit. AD MARIUM, &c. BU stay! I'le Charme my passion for a while, And turn my anger to a mournful smile. Before I quite depart, i'le wit to thee, Who art the cause of all my misery. I think it not amiss to bid adiew: Not to your noble Sex but unto you: You faithless woman, once the better part Of a right noble, faithful loving heart, But now foever xid, nere to be Admitted there, nay, not return to see The owner of it: for thy Treason hath Condemn'd thy self, thou forfed'st all thy Faith,
Being a Traitor: therefore 'tis good reason, The Prayer should be punish'd for the reason What was the cuuse that mov'd thee to betray My real I ocete? who did'st thou say Thou lov'ast me so? thy protestatious Won me, Which I beleive, and that Faith hath undone me. I often heard thee sing, that 'tis more rare To be a Constant Woman then a Fait: If so, as 'tis most true, why did'st thou prove Untrue to me, unconstant in thy Love But hol my weeding Pen, Not, Not so fast; I dare not recollect the Vows she past, And terme her Faithless: No, I here must halt: Yet not look back; least doing the same fault As Lots ife did, I might coverte be Into a shape, and so he like to thee. Perjur'd Maria; for thou art scarce more Then a meer moving Statue; yet the score Of my just mind, from whom, since I have found Thee false, by God and nature am unbound; For  in appearance I did Saint in thy Fate but Sathan in thy mind. And I assure you, I can well remain Without a woman, so unsure and vai Thou id'st ceive me: true, yet I forgive, And my revenge is this. Long may'st thou Live: For that revenge will be sufficien: Live to disgrace av ve thou to repent I'le not ande non to revenge a wrong That carrys with it the revenge along: Yet Charity and pitty I have still, Forgive I do, and pray for thee I will: Live happy if thou canst, I envy not Thy happiness, but waile my own hard Lot: But fure it cannot, but much greive thy heart To think thy Vice, made thee from Virtue part: And so Farewell for ever; here you have My last Farewell, betwixt this and my grave. FINIS.
