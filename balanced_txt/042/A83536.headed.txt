And finding it necessary since our coming hither, that for those ends Judicatories be speedily erected, to the effecting whereof in a setled and orderly way, more time will be required then the present condition of Scotland, by reason of the long want of Administration of Justice will permit; we have thought fit to make the same known unto the People of Scotland. And likewise, That in consideration of the present Exigency, we shall by vertue of the Power unto us given in that behalf, by the Parliament of the Com∣monwealth of England, forthwith appoint and authorize persons to the Administration of Justice unto the People of Scotland, who are to be continued for some short time, until the Judicatories and Courts of Justice may in a more solemn and lasting way be established.

And, that none may pretend ignorance hereof, We have commanded this Decla∣ration to be Printed and Proclaimed at the Market-cross of Edenburgh,
