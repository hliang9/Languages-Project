A PLEASANT PVRGE, FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIKE, To evacuate his EVILL HƲMOVRS. Consisting of a Century of Polemicall Epigrams; wherein divers grosse Errors, and Corruptions of the Church of Rome are disco∣vered, censured, refuted, in a facetious, yet serious manner. By WILLIAM PRYNNE, an Vtter-Barrester of Lincolnes-Inne; who composed these Poems, to solace himselfe, in his late tedious Imprisonments. Horatius de Arte Poetica. Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. Jeremiah 51. 6. Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his Soule; be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lords venge∣ance; he will render unto her a recompence. 2 Thessalonians 2. 10, 11, 2. Because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved; for this cause God shal send them strong delusions, that they should beleeve a lye: that they all might be damned who beleeved not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse. Printed at London by R. C. for Michael Sparke Senior, dwelling at the blue Bible in Greene Arbour, 1642.

To the Courteous Reader. MEeting with sundryThe Lord Ewer Lord Morley. Sir Maurice Drum∣mond, with o∣thers, in the Tower of Lon∣don and else∣where. Papists whiles that I Remain'd a Prisoner under Custody; We oft conferred in a friendly way, Of divers points of Doctrine, wherein they Dissented from us; and some Practicall Corruptions, which they, Rome, Devotion call. On this occasion, to helpe passe the time, I some of our Discourses turn'd to Rime; That so I might with greater Liberty, And lesse Offence, their Errors lash, descry; Both to convince, and cause them to despise, Their fond false Tenents, Worships, Blasphemies. Which Poems since, being licensed the Presse, As usefull for these times; fit to represse Romes spreading Errors (Ave Maryes Bedes, Cruci∣fixes, Bowing to Altars, &c. some whereof I finde Not yet oppugn'd by any in that kinde, As here they are;) I them shall recommend Unto thy use (kinde Reader) to this end, That thou maist weigh their matter, not their dresse; Which is but rude, unworthy View, or Presse. Minde then their Substance, not lame Poetry; And all Defects in friendly sort passe by. If any Health thou by this PVRGE shalt gaine; Blesse God; and pray for him who shall remaine, Thine in the Truth, WILLIAM PRYNNE.

First, t'was anLuk▪ 1. 26. 28▪ Angell sayd it; Angels pray Not unto men, whom theyPs. 34. 7. Ps. 91. 11. Hob. 1, 14 gard, save alway; God never sent an Angell to teach Men, To pray to Him, much lesse to Mary; then It is no Prayer; no Angels but Christ may Presume once to prescribe what Men shall pray. He spake it when heLuk. 1. 28. 31. 32. 3▪ came her newes to bring Of Christs conception, craving her nothing.
It was aLuk. 1. 26. 28. greete from God; to make it then A Prayer to her, makes God to pray to Men. There is no word in it which possibly His greete a Prayer to her can once Imply. Besides, theLuk. 1. 29. Text,All Offices and Romish Catechismes terme it, the Angels or An∣gelicall Salu∣tation. you, it expressely call A Salutation, and no prayer at all. And that a meere salute a pray'r should be To her, seemes strange, nay senselesse unto me. The Text addes further;Luk. 1. 29. 30. So he sayd to Zacharie, v. 13. Feae not &c. yet none say thus to the Virgin or him though the Angell did it: why then say they Ave and not this to? she was troubled at His saying, and did cast in her minde, what Manner of Salutation this should be: Which made the Angell say, (c) Feare not: Had she Thought this a prayer made to her, certainely She had not thus bin troubled, scar'd thereby. Nought this a prayer, unto her can import, To make it then a Prayer now is mad sport, Unlesse be for her: if you this deny, A Prayer for her the words it prove clearely. FirstLuk. 1. 28. , signifies properly Gau∣de, or rejoyce. Ave, which All Haile, or happinesse Attend you, signifies, is an expresse Prayer for, not to her; and is just the same With our salute, God save you blessed Dame; Which all confesse to be a Pray'r not to But for those we salute; than Ave's so. Next, Dominus Tecum; The Lord be with thee, Is a prayer for, not to her: this to be So, is most cleare by all your Liturgies, Houres Masse-bookes, where the Priest thus prayes and cryes. Officium B. Mariae & Missale Roma∣num passim. Dominus Tecum oft times; which all call A prayer to God, for, not to men at all.
By this then see your Madnesse, folly, shame, In saying Aves to the Blessed Dame. You thinke thereby you onely pray unto Not for the Virgin, when you quite crosse doe, Praying not to, but for her alwayes when You say your Aves: O mad, senselesse Men! If she thus neede your Aves her to save, Blesse, bring to God, how can you then ought crave Pray, gaine from her? If she needs prayers from you She can ill ayde, save those who to her sue.

On, and against Popish Beades, and Pater-Nosters oft Repetition on them. I Wonder much why Papists onThese Beads must be so∣lemnely hal∣lowed ere they must be used to say our Ladies Psalter on: the forme of which conse∣cration you may reade in Tho. Beacons 3. Vol. f. 291. 292. 358. 359. Bedes pray, And all their Pater-Nosters by them say. Is it because they set them out to sale, And none will buy them by their weight but Tale? As they doe wodden Billets; and therefore They must have Beades to keepe true Count and score? If so; it seemes a just and Lawfull Act; Though to sell Prayers, be no Christian Fact. Or is it, because they contract each day With God, how many Paters they will say To him? and so their Bedes serve to keepe true Account, that God from them may have his due; So many Pater-Nosters just as they By Contract, vow, or pennance, ought to pay? This seemes an honest Practise, and most just, To render God his due: yet then they must First prove, that God takes all their prayers by Tale Not weight; but this would marre their price and sale. Their Paters are so light, that God must take Them all by Tale, sith they no weight will make. For should he ballance them, their endlesse tale Of Paters, would not Poyse, nor turne the Scale.
Bedes then keepe equall Scores, 'twixt God and them; God would forget else what they pay to him: He is oblivious, if not false; therefore They dare not trust him, they must keepe the score. Or else they deeme he mindes no more than they Their mumbled Paters; else they would not pray By Count; I doubt they cheate God in the Score Sometimes, to make him minde their Paters more. Or doe they use their Bedes alone to finde That tale of Paters which they seldome minde? Their thoughts being else-where when their Pater's sayd, The Bedes must tell them still how oft they pray'd: Their Paters sure are sayd with great devotion; They doe not know their summe, but by Bedes Motion: Should God them take by weight, than, not by Count, So many feathers would their poyse surmount. I doubt their Beades, though light, will overweigh All Paters, Aves, which they on them say; And are far more worth were they to be sold, Than all the Paters, Aves, on them told. But why must Paters thus be said by score? Did Christs Apostles, Prophets, Saints before Time use it? No, reade Scripture new or old You finde no Paters, Prayers on Beades told. Some thinke our Bede, these Beads did first invent, From whom they tooke their Name; if I consent (Peter the Hermite was the first that invented Beades and Chappelets a∣bout the yeare. 1263. Iohn Crespin: Lest. de L'eglis. p. 382. O∣thers make them of later date. Though false,) yet for sev'n hundred yeares, or more Next after Christ, none Paters by Beades score Said; now the Case is alt'red; few can say Their Paters, unlesse they on Beades them pray. Pray on them? No: let him marke who this reads
They never use to pray, but say their Beads: This is their Proper language, so as they Confesse, their Beades helpe make them not to pray; To say indeede, nay use vaine Repetition, Against the Paters and Christs Prohibition, Who first ordain'd theMat. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. Eccles. 5. 2. Pater purposely Vaine Babling, and your Bedes quite to put by, Which Christ condemnes as Heathnish, and defends All his to use, because it God offends. But Chaplets now this remedie hath mar'd, And made it the disease it should discard: Some scores of Pater Nosters must be said On Beades, ere God can heare, minde what they praide: He's growne now deafe belike, and cannot heare Their first, next, third, fourth Pater; or they feare He is asleepe, or dreaming; so that he With peales of Paters must awaked be, Or with their Beads great ratling sound and noise, Ere he can heare or listen to their voyce.

Such Idle Babble, and Battologie God doth condemne, reject, hate, and defie, Especially when they kneele downe before Saints Images, and say their Paters o're To them, as if they God the Father were, And did their Beades and babled Paters heare: Which damned common practise Rome allow's In herCap. de O∣ratione.

Without offence; andA briefe in∣struction, &c. By George Douley Priest: Edit. 4. 1638. Permissu supe∣riorum. p. 84. George Douly doth tell Us now of late, in his Instruction Of the chiefe points of your Religion, That doubtlesse men may say the Pater, or The Ave Marie unto the honour, Or Invocation of any other Saint or Angell, with this intent, either To pray to God that he would have mercy Vpon their soules, for this Saints, Angels Cry; Or to craze of the Saints themselves, that they Will offer to God for them what they pray. A new point of faith and devotion, Not knowne to Christ, but to Romes Priests alone: Had Papists sense or Reason, they might see How oft repeated Pater Nosters be Most irkesome, loathsome to God, not pleasing. For if men here should to a Judge, Lord, King, Ten, twenty, thirty, Forty times, or more Together the same words, requests, say o're, (As they to God say Paters) all would thinke Them mad or foolish; yea their suites would stinke And be denide for this their Clam'rous cry, Thougst Just, since mar'd by such Battologie. If it be folly, frenzie, babling then Oft to repeate our suites and plaints to men, Yea, the next way to make them us deny; Is it not just the same to God to cry Thus Pater, Pater, for an houre or more Untill your Beades be fully numbred ore? Mat. 6. 5. to 10. Doubtlesse it is, nay a meere mockery Of God, who turnes his eares from this vaine cry. All deeme the Cuckoos, which doe oft times sing Nought else but Cuckoo, Cuckoo, in the spring For three Moneths space; most foolish birds be∣cause They oft repeate their Cuckoo, without pause;
And we thinke children, fooles, the Cuckooes play, In counting then how oft they Cuckoo say. Papists are worse than Cuckooes, which forbeare Their Cuckooes song for nine moneths space each yeare; When they their Cuckoo-Paters night and day, All the yeare long repeate, and never stay. Yea, whereas Cuckooes never keepe account How oft they Cuckoo cry; they them surmount In this, that they cry Cuckoo and keepe score How oft they doe it, on Beades made therefore; So that they are more sottish, foolish, vaine Than Cuckoos, Children, Fooles, and so remaine; Whose severall follies all conjoyned be In them, and linkt in one, as now we see. If they on Beades to pray will still proceede, They are Fooles, Children, and the Cuckooes seede. On, and against Popish Crucifixes, and Images of Christ. NO Pictures can so lively represent Christs Death and Passion, as the1 Cor. 11. 24. 25. 26. Gal. 3. 1. Sacrament And Word, the onely Crucifixes he Hath left his Church, his death, to minde, and see.

Because Romes Pope else should sustain great losse; He could not else possesse thy throne, and reigne, Not as thy Vicar but thy Soveraigne; Thy Lawes else must be kept, thy word obey'd, Thy will by him fulfill'd, and not gaine-sayd: All which Popes doe against, beside thy word Should then be voyd, and by all men abhor'd; They must be Peter then in Truth, not name, Else thou wouldst thrust them from his chaire with shame. Good reason have they then to nayle and tye Christ to these Crosses for Eternity. In this they shew their peerelesse faith, and love, To bind Christ fast that he should never move From off these Crosses, to oppose their-will, They doe so love his precepts to fulfill.

And never more the Crosse, nayles, speare adore For Saints, which kil'd Christ, and his body tore: But whilst they thus adore these, they imply That to kill Christ, deserves a Deity: The Souldiers than and Jewes who Crucifi'd Him more than these, must now be deifide, And worshipt withAquinas Summae: pars. 3. qu. 25.

On, and against, Popish Pictures of the Vir∣gin Mary as a Queene, sitting on a Throne with a Triple Crowne on her head, and holding Christ, painted like a sucking Infant, in her Armes; and on the Reliques of her milke, which they keepe and shew. FIe, Mary, fie; what give sucke to a Baby? It is not decent, fit for Queene, nor Lady: With them it's out of fashion; thou wilt shame Thy selfe with these, they will thee taxe and blame: Wer't thou no Lady, Queene, as heretofore, Thou migh'st doe this; but now not doe it more Since Queene and Lady too: Thy childe growes great Or old enough to be wean'd from the Teat.

Shall he be still a suckling, or a foole To sucke so long? tis time he were at Schoole. Others give sucke but for one yeare, or two; Thou, sixteene hundred yeares, what doest thou doe Thus to turmoyle thy selfe? and all in vaine, He doth a little Infant yet remaine, Where some not halfe so old as he, have knowne Ten Generations unto old men growne. Sure thy milke, I doubt, is very bad, Thy Babe ere this might else have beene a Lad; Out of his coates, at least; No age hath knowne One sucke so long, and yet so little growne. No doubt, if noted, tis a Miracle Whose strangenesse doth all Wonders else excell. But (blessed Virgin) can thy milke be ill, Sith nought butLuk. 1. 28. Goodnesse all thy members fill?

I feare the blessed Virgin is Un-Sainted; Or hath quite lost her old Virginity, She now appeeres so wanton to the Eye; So rich, and stately, in such Dresses she Never here used, and abhorr'd to see. I feare some Ladies who curle, powder, paint, To warrant these, have made her such a Saint: Stript her of all her modest, course aray, Put her in fashion, made her rich, compt, gay, Curled and spotted; yea, as wanton, vaine As those lew'd Females who in Stewes remaine. She was a modest Virgin heretofore, Now she may be a Lady, or a Whore. Fie Ladies, fie! you may your selves defame And Antique thus, but not this blessed Dame,
Who spits at all such Dresses, and defies Her selfe and you, whiles clad in such disguise. No wonder if lewd Rome the Whore now play; Shee makes the Virgin one by such Aray, To Grace her Trade, and keepe her Company: How dare Her Nunnes then save their Chastitie? AlasNicolaus de Clemangis, de corrupto Ecclesiae statu c. 15. 23. A∣grippa De. Va. Sciet. c. 63. they doe it not; but seemingly; They were Romes Bastards else, not Progeny. I'le never thinke Romes Church chaste any more, Who paints the blessed Virgin like a Whore; Nor wonder why the Female Sexe curles, paints, They learne to doe it from the Roman Saints. These are now lawfull by Canonisation; Not ill, but holy by Romes Consecration; No doubt most Madams will now curle, spot, paint, Since to doe these things is to be a Saint, At least in shew; and that may well suffice; No matter for the Heart, these please the Eyes. If by nought else, by this at least we know Romes Saints are voyd of substance, nought but shew; Nay, Romes great vaunting Church to be a Whore, Since farre more painted, gaudie than before, More stor'd with Baudes and Panders to intice Men to her lusts, and to uphold her vice.

Christ but one Vicar can have here; He many, To doe his Office; he then is not any. Either the Pope must doe his worke alone, Or if by Vicar, he must make but one: Else Christ may chance to make more Vicars too By his example, and so him undoe, Unlesse he tye Christs hands from making any, Because himselfe before had made too many.

They write, that Francis in worth farre excels All the Apostles, and that now he dwels In Heav'n in Christs owne bosome, More: That he Was here a Jesus typically: yea A figurative Saviour: who upon His body receiv'd in a Vision The selfe-same wounds that Christ did, yea suffred The selfe-same paines: and thereby renewed Christs passion in him, for to save man-kinde: Of which the Prophet David doth men minde Who saith.Psal. 3. 5.

For all who him professe:] That the same grace Descendeth on him, who shall but embrace His Order of Religion, as doth fall On him that is baptized. Is this all? No: they say further, the meere putting on Of Francis hood gives full remission Of sinnes, and frees from their guilt, punishment: That the bare resolution and intent To take his Order, though not put inure, Is a new Baptisme, doth pardon procure. They teach; that Christ hath but prayed, but Francis Hath impetrated or obtained.

S. Dominicke [which is far more] whiles yet A mortall man into the Church did get At night, the Gates fast shut, least he should wake His Brethren: Christ, after his death thus spake Mat. 28. 18. All power in Heaven and Earth is given to me; And this power to S. Dominicke [writes he] Was not communicated sparingly Whiles here, 'ore all things in the Heavens high On Earth, and underneath the Earth: For he Had the blest Angels at his Service; the Foure Elements did unto him obey, The Devils trembled at his sight, and they Vnable were to dis-obey him; as He doth by Legends prove: That ere he was Borne or brought forth into the world, there were In Venice two Statues: In Markes Church there, The one of Paul as they use him to paint, Over the which was this Inscription, Saint Paul, but under the Image feete was writ, By this man we come unto Christ; Neare it The other of S. Dominicke was plac'd In a poore preaching Fryers habit, grac'd With this Motto, S. Dominicke, above, But underfoote with; By this man we move And goe more easie unto Christ; For why The doctrine of St Paul [writes Anthony] And other Apostles, did but onely lead To Faith, and keeping of Gods Lawes we reade; But Dominickes did teach men to obey Counsells, which is the shorter, easier way To goe to Christ: Oh horrid blasphemy S. Dominicke thus to advance so high Above S. Paul, all the Apostles; and To make his Doctrines take the upper hand Of the Apostles, as the shortest, best, Way unto Christ! He addes yet to the rest,
That he was aptly named Dominike, Because he was to Christ himselfe most like: For Dominicke was that principally, And by possession, what absolutely, And by authority Christ was [marke ye His proofe] For the Lord saith thus,Joh. 8. 12. I am the Light of the world, and the Church doth thus sing Of Dominick, Thou art the Light, Day-spring Of the world: yea, as the Prophets of old Of the Lord Christ bore witnesse, and foretold In divers wayes: So Prophet Zachary Of Dominicke and his Order saithZech. 11. 7. I Have taken unto me two staves, ne I Did call Beauty, the other Cords: Beauty Is the Sect of Saint Dominicke, for the Beautifull habits of their Prelates we Behold: the Cords, are nought but Minor Fryers Girt with a Cord, and thence cald Cordeliers [A worthy Glosse on this Text;] thus they play With Sacred Scripture: Furthermore they say, Christ was borne on the bare earth, but Mary For feare of cold, did himLuk. 2. 7. swath presently, And put into a Manger. Dominicke, Whiles yet an Infant, oft times off did kicke His clothes, and getting from his cratch, was found By his Nurse lying naked on hare ground, Detesting, as it were, all the delights Of the flesh: Anthony yet farther writes; That at our Lords birth there appear'd aMat. 2. 1. to 20. starre, Which guided the wise men who came from farre Ʋnto him: which did intimate that the Whole world by him should then inlightned be. So in the forehead of Dominicke, when He was Baptiz'd his God-mother did A shining starre; which signifi'd, that he A new light come into the world should be.
He addes: The prayer of Christ was heard alway When ere he would: but yet when he did pray Within the Garden,Mat. 26. 36. that the cup might passe Fom him, this suite of his denyed was; Because he praying thus but sensually, He would in reason have God him deny. But Dominicke did never ought require Of God, but he obtain'd his full desire, Because he nought requested according Vnto the flesh; They harpe more on this string: TheRevel. 1. 5. Lord hath loved us, and washt away Our sinnes in his blood: Dominicke, say they, Out of perfection of his Charity, Spending the whole night with God fervently In prayer, did with his owne hands every day A threefold whipping undergoe [I pray By what command from God?] not with whipcord But with an Iron chaine, wherewith be goard And lasht himselfe to blood-shed; One was done For his owne sinnes, which were but small or none; Another for those Soules in Purgatory; The third for those who in this world yet lye: In fine, (to passe by and not name the rest Of their blasphemous Parallels, at best;) When our Lord Christ would leave this world, be to His griev'd Disciples [loth him to fore-goe] Promis'd to send aJoh. 4. 16. Comforter, that is The holy Ghost: Saint Domincke to his Disciples, neere his death, sayd; Doe not ye My deare Friends mourne, nor vexe at all for me, Nor let my now departure hence you move, For in the place to which I goe, above The Cloudes, I shall be far more profitable To you than I, whiles here, to be am able: For after my decease you shall me have A better Advocate by much, to crave

On the strange Popish Miracles, attributed to, and forged of S. Vincent Ferrier, and S. Anthony of Padua. SOme Popish Saints in Miracles out-reach Christs owne Apostles; who sent out toAct. 2. 1. to 12. c. 10. 46. c. 19. 6. preach To sundry Nations, were most wondrously Endow'd with all tongues knowledge, from an high, That so they might to all men preach in their Owne Language: ButRibadenie∣ra Fleurs des vies des Saints part. p. 384. Saint Vincent Ferrier, Preaching in Spanish to strangers who knew Not this his Language [if the tale be true] Was understood by all as perfectly, As if he had preacht to them severally In their owne tongues; Nay, some who earnestly▪ Desir'd to heare him Preach, not possibly Able to come unto the Church, did heare Him more than one whole league off, very cleare; He had a lowder voyce belike than all Christs twelve Apostles, joyned with S. Paul,
Since none could heare them preaching halfe that space As these this Saint heard. Nor was this his case Alone;Ribade∣niera Ibid. pag. 563. for I reade that S. Anthony Of Padua, who Preacht in one onely Language, to those of sundry Nations, who Were unacquainted with his Tongue, was so Well understood of them, as if that he Had Preacht in their owne Dialect: yea the Good wife who would have come to his Sermo But hindred by her husband, got upon Her Barne to heare it, heard him perfectly Halfe a league off the place he preach't in; she Had very good eares doubtlesse, or else he A thundring voyce. They make him yet doe more Than Christ, or his Apostles heretofore. For Preaching at Ariminum unto The Heretiques, who stopt their Eares that so They might not heare his voyce; he presently Went to the Sea-side, to that Towne then nigh, And there with great affiance in Gods ayde, Called unto the fishes, and them pray'd To bearken to him, whom the Sectaries And Heretickes to heare did then despise. This sayd: an infinite scooll of great, small And middle sort of fishes, ranged all In their set Order, lift their heads above The water, him to heare; who out of love, Calls them his Brethren, then did to them make A Sermon of the blessings they partake, And still receive from God, instructing them What thankes and Service they should yeeld to him: Which Sermon ended, all the Fishes bow'd Their heads his blessing to receive; The crowd Of people seeing this strange sight, were all Astonied, and the Heretiques did fall
Downe at his feete, desiring him to preach To them, and Gods truth among them to teach: I wish he had it taught to those who write These lyes of him, and them for truths recite. Then had we never furtherRibadenei∣ra Ibid. read, that he To Bouivil his Asse or Mule, brought the Host with great reverence, when she had beene Kept three dayes fasting, and no meate had seene, Commanding the beast in the Lords name, he Then held in his hands, to come how the knee Forthwith to his Creator, and adore Him, that Christs presence therein might no more Be henceforth doubted, Heretiques thereby Confounded; which spoke, the Asse instantly Her Master, and her Provender forsakes, Though hungry, and upon her knees there makes Prostration to the Host, as to her maker And Lord [though made by the Priest or Baker.] Which miracle so evident, greatly The Catholickes did comfort, edifie: But did encourage Heretiques much more, Who the Host as their Lord would not adore For all this miracle: Rome might let passe This peece of worship, prov'd thus by this Asse, Sith they at least are Asses, if not more, Who from an Asse learne how God to adore. On the Popish Blasphemous Legends of their S. Catherine of Sennes. TIs strange what RomishAntonini Chron. pars 3. Lugdun. 1543. Tit. 23. c. 14. Sect. 4. to 19. f. 180. to 188. Ribade∣niera Fleurs des vies des Saints part. 1. p. 435. to 44. Legends write of their Saint Catherine of Sennes, who cut her haire To shun her Marriage, having formerly Espous'd her selfe to Christ most solemnely,
And ow'd to be his spouse alone. They say That she did whip her selfe three times each day For three houres space, with a sharpe Iron chaine, So that her blood did issue forth amaine Out of all parts of her body; willing To repay Christ by this her blood-shedding, The blood which he for her sinnes shed on the Crosse, that she might no debtor to him be. To passe by all her strict Fasts, Disciplines, Strange Visions, as requiring many lines, They write, that Christ did so familiarly Converse with her, appeare so frequently To her, when she did pray, or meditate, Walke or repose her selfe, early and late, That he seem'd alwayes present with her, yea And talke with her saying, Thinke thou of me And I shall thinke and take of thee the care, With sundry such discourses which I spare: That Jesus Christ enamored with her, Appeared to her with his owne mother And other Saints, and her most solemnely Espoused in their presence visibly, The Virgin Mary leading her unto Her Sonne Christ Jesus, as a person who Was worthy to be wedded specially To him; who condescending, presently To this her motion, put a Ring of Gold With foure rich stones on her finger, then told Her: I betroth thee to me thy maker And Saviour: After which act he did her Continually visit familiarly, Bringing with him oft times Virgin Mary, And sometimes other Saints, yet usually Comming alone, keeping her company, Walking, reciting Psalmes with her, which She Ʋnlearned knew not how to read, till he
At her request, did teach her instantly By Miracle to reade them perfectly. They write, that Christ himselfe the Sacrament Gave unto her, that the Host it selfe went Vnto her mouth without helpe, and that she The Child Jesus in the Host oft did see: That Christ his wound in his left side opened For her, who thence Christs owne warme blood sucked: That he stampt on her his five wounds, that she In suffring torments might like to Christ be. In fine; they write, that Christ did really Change hearts with her, tooke out of her body [Opened on the left side] her heart; which he Tooke with him for some space: that meane time She Lived without an heart: that soone after Christ in his glory did appeare to her With a red beautifull heart in his hand, And comming neere to her, where she did stand He thrust it in to her on the left side, Saying to her, My daughter and my Bride, I here deliver my heart unto thee In leiw of thine: which uttered then be Her side clos'd up: and that this really Was done, not in a vision, shew onely, The scarre remaining in her side descry'd, Which her Companions oft times view'd and ey'd. These most Blasphemous, grosse, notorious lyes Which every Christian Soule abhors, defies, Romes Church proclaimes for truths conformable Ʋnto her faith: and them approves full well. Witnesse theNous &c. we under sig∣ning Doctors in the faculty of Theologie at Paris certifie, that we have diligently read this book, &c. In which we have found no∣thing but what is conformable to the faith of the Catholicke Apostolike and Roman Church, and therefore we judge it very usefull and ne∣cessary to be published.

On a Popish Miracle of their Deifide Hostia. OUrTho. Wal∣singham ypo∣digma Neu∣striae, Anno. 1215. p. 55. Walsingham relates this Miracle, That Otho, when deposed, not being well, At point of death did earnestly desire His extreame Viand, ere he should expire: Which he [unable to retaine ought, he Then tooke] desired onely but to see, Not eate Christs Body; which when the Priest nigh Him brought, he it with great humility Ador'd, then drawing neere to it stretching His armes out, as if he were most willing It to embrace, his body quite naked, The Host out of the Priests hands then leaped, And through an hole which opened instantly In his flesh, just whereas his heart did lye Entred into his Body: which done, the Hole forthwith clos'd up so that none could see The Print of any scarre: When he the Host Had thus receiv'd, he rendred up the Ghost. This nimble skipping Host was certainly Ill tutored, to leape so wondrously Into the heart of one deposed by The Pope himselfe, as the Church enemy; And to breake Christs owne institution Not beingMat. 26. 26. eaten, nor once fed upon. Which makes me feare this Monstrous Miracle Is but a Fable, coyn'd in some Monkes Cell.

On Popes right to interpret Scripture, and their strange Glosses on sundry Texts, to prove their Supremacy, and the Law∣fulnesse of deposing and killing Kings, who disobey them. MUst not the Pope interpret Scripture? yea Good reason, else a Pope he could not be. No Text him makes Christs vicar, Peter, Pope; His Glosse must helpe here, else he had no hope Of being either, that makes him these, more: No reason then he should this right give o're. PopesBellar. de verbo Dei. l. 3. c. 10. Gretzer. De. c. 1. l. 1. De verbo Dei. p. 16. claime it as their proper right and due To expound the Scriptures, which none doe so true, So well as they, in all points, specially In defence of their owne Supremacy, And right to judge, depose, kill Kings, here they Such comments make on Texts, as will display Their learning, wisedome, and unerring power; For instance, they say, that our Saviour Sayd unto, Peter,Joh 21. 15 16. 17. Feede my sheepe: therefore The Popes Supreame head of Christs Church: nay more They hence inferre, that they may judge, depose, Kill Christian Kings, & of their Crownes dispose: Feeding is killing now with Popes, and they Good shepheards are, when they their flockes spoyle, slay. Christ sayd to Peter,Luc. 5 4 lanch out from the shore Into the deepe, and loose your Nets; therefore The Pope is supreame head, may Kings put downe And loose his Net, to catch their Kingdomes Crowne:
I doubt S. Peter never had one thought Of catching such Fish when he lanch't his boate. Christ sayd to PeterMat. 16. 19. whatsoever thou Shalt bind, or loose here upon Earth below, Shall be bound, loos'd in heav'n, therefore Popes may Kings Excomunicate, depose, judge, slay; Nay loose those Subjects from their oathes, which tye Them to obedience, truth, and Loyalty; And bind Kings so, that they shall vassals be To Popes, and ne're once strive against Romes See▪ I feare this kind of binding, loosing fall Besides this text, which meant them not at all. Once the Disciples sayd to Christ,Luk. 22. 38. Pope Bo∣niface inter∣preted it. De Major. & Obe∣dientia. Unam Sanctam, &c. Behold Here are two swords, upon which Christ them told, That is enough; therefore both swords, with all Soveraigne power, as well temporall As spirituall doth appertaine of right Unto the Pope; he may with both swords smite, I thinke S. Peter did not then descry That these two swords did so great power imply As his successors have since in them found; Who on the sword, not word their Empire ground. No wonder if they slay, not Preach the Word; They sticke not to the Text, but to the Sword. Christ saithMat. 28. 18. Applied to Pope Leo the 10. in the Councell of Lataran by Stephen Arch-Bishop of Pa∣tracla. All things in heaven and earth to me Are given of my Father; therefore the Pope hath all power, Crownes, Kingdomes of meere right Belonging to him, and by his owne might May dispossesse all Kings who them enjoy, When he thinkes meete, if they him disobey, Yea hence they plead,See Offici∣um B.

I deeme this Text belongs to Christ onely, Its error then it to Popes to apply. Christ sayd to Peter,Act. 10. 11. 12. 13. Arise, kill and eate; [That is, such beasts, fowles onely made for meate Which he saw in a trance, from heav'n let downe In a great sheete:] Therefore Popes may uncrowne, Depose, kill Kings, and Princes at their will, If they refuse their mandates to fulfill: Nay send them soule and body unto hll. I feare the Pope expounds this text not well, Sith there was no King, man within the sheete, Bu creeping things, foules and beasts with fowre fee. If Popes from hence will kill Kings, they must eate Their flesh likewise. O'tis a royall meate. ChristMat. 21. 1. 2. 3. Ma. 11. 1. 2. 3. two Disciples sent, and bad them loose An Asses colt, and bring him [can you choose But laugh at this rare glosse?] the Pope therefore Hath right to all mens goods, both rich and poore: Yea, to Kings Crownes, & may them binde, unty; Depose; free subjects from their Loyalty, Oathes of Allegiance, fealty, even as Christs two Disciples did untie the Asse: Popes are hard driven when they must repaire Unto this Asse, to prop up Peters chaire. Christ sayd,Joh. 12. 32. if I be lift up from earth, I Will draw all things unto me: Popes hereby All Kingdomes, Crownes, things of right to them draw And claime them as their due, by Christs own law. But since Christ drawes al things to him, on high, Not to the Pope, on Earth, I must deny This Roman glosse, till Popes can make it cleare That Christ speaks of them, of Crowns not Soules Ce. 1. 1. In the beginning [not beginnings] God Created Heav'n and earth [note here Popes odde here. Glosse and deduction;] Therefore there's but one Beginning, Monarch; who? the Pope alone,
Whence all Kings, Princes, Prelates, Priests powre springs; And Popes may make, judge, sway, depose, kill Kings.

Glosser in this Sort manifests; That as the Sunnes greatnesse And magnitude exceeds the Moones, no lesse Than forty seven [nay fifty sixe] times; so, The Pope in greatnesse, might, power, doth out-goe Him, no lesse than forty seven times; and as The moone no luster, nor light in it has But what the Sunne derives to it: so Kings And Emperours power, lustre from Popes springs; Whereas in truth, the Popes authority, And greatnesse wasMatthew Westm.

But sith the Sunne, not Pope, was this great light Here meant, I doubt the Glosse is false, not right. Christ sayd thatJohn 1. 42.

Innocent, whereas Christ there interprets it to be, a Stone Whence he inferres, that none but Popes alone Are heads of Christs Church and Lords Paramount To Kings, and may them censure, kill, dismount. This Glosse was made but by an Innocent, Who understood not what this Cephas ment, Nor what's the duty of an head, toEphes. 4. 15. 16. c. 5. 22. 23. 24. 29. guide Not kill the members, or them rule with pride.
Christ sayd to Peter,Mat. 26. 52. Put thou up thy sword Into the seabbard; from which very word PopeDe Major. & Obed. unam Sanctam, &c. Boniface the eight most learnedly Resolves, the temporall sword doth rightly Belong to Popes; and that the Temporall Sword subject is to the Hierarchicall. But since Christ sayd, put up, not use this sword, This Text no such conclusion will afford. God sayd to Jeremie the Prophet, See IJer. 1. 10. over Nations, Kingdomes have set thee To roote out, pull downe and destroy [namely By threatning judgements for their sinnes onely:] Therefore saySerm. in festo Greg.

When Christ gave his Apostles their Charter And grand Commission, he expresly there Thus bounds their power, sayingMat. 28. 19. 20. Goe ye and Preach The Gospell to all Nations, and them teach ALL THINGS FOR TO OBSERVE WHAT∣SOEVER I HAVE YOU COMMANDED: adding, and loe, I Am with you alwayes unto the worlds end. Sith Christ then did his owne Apostles send Forth, but to teach all men to observe Whatever he commanded, and not swerve From it unto the left hand or the right: How Romes Popes, Church have now more po∣wer, might, right Than Peter, the Apostles had to change, Repeal Christs will, Acts, Edicts, seemes most strange To me, and she must shew me some expresse Commission from Christ, which doth theirs sup∣presse, And give Popes power to rob the Laity Quite of Christs Chalice, given formerly Unto them by his will, and that Popes be Exempt from Christs Injunctions now, though He Be alwayes present in his Church as King And Supreame Lord, directing every thing; Or else I must deny that Popes justly May take Christs Cup thus from the Laity. When Paul th' abuses in the Sacrament At Corinth would reforme, he that Church sent 1 Cor. 11. 17. to 30. Ʋnto Christs owne prime Institution, Blaming them first for its transgression, And then informes them very punctually; I have receiv'd of the Lord that which I Also delivered unto you; that the
Lord Jesus in the selfe-same night that he Was betray'd tooke bread; and so forth: After Supper he tooke the Cup in like manner Adding this clause to both; As oft as ye Doe this, doe it in memory of me. For as oft as ye eate this bread; AND this Cup drinke, ye shew the Lords death untill his Comming againe: By which words it is plaine, All must drinke Christs Cup till he come againe. Since Paul then doth them checke for varying From Christs first Institution, injoyning All to conforme thereto; I hence clearely Conclude Romes Church hath no Authority Or right at all from Christs first forme to stray; Much lesse his Cup, Blood, thus to take away From Laickes, who must it drinke and retaine By this Texts warrant, till Christ come againe.

Dan. 5. 3. 4. allow wine for all guests to drinke, All will those lewde, presumptuous Servants think Who dare eclipse their liberality, And send their guests away from Supper dry. Thus Rome deales with her Lord Christs guests: I feare She will one day for this affront pay deare.Reply. If any urge, ThatMat. 19. 7. 8. Moses anciently In cases of Divorce did really Dispence with Gods owne Law; Therefore Popes may The Sacred Cup from Lay-men take away. I rejoyne;Rejoynder. Moses did not this thing by His owne meere power and Authority, But by expresseDeut. 24. 1. 2. 3. 4. c. 16. 17. c. 12. 1. Mar. 7. 8. 10. c. 3. to 10. compared to∣gether. Command from God, which we In sundry Texts upon record yet see. But Popes have no command from Christ to take Away the Cup: see then their grosse mistake And absur'd argument: Moses, say they, By Gods Command, did let men put away Their wives in certaine cases, contrary To the first law of Marriage; formerly Enacted: therefore Popes without command From Christ, by their owne might may counter∣mand Christs Institutions; and quite take away His Cup from people who are meerely Lay. A grosse inconsequent. But if that I Grant, Moses by his owne (authority Did this, which is not true; yet Popes must next Prove their power as great as his from some Text, And that this cause of divorce, arbitrary At mens free choyce, and practised onely By few,) is just the same, with Popes taking The Cup by force from all Lay-men: which thing
Sith they can no wayes prove, they must confesse Their wicked error, theft, and it redresse. But Romes Popes here object, this precept was Given to Priests alone,Object. 2. who in the Masse Still drinke the Cup; not unto Lay-men. I To this evasion shall first thus reply:Answer. 1. That if, Drinke ye ALL of it, were spoke to Th' Apostles onely as Priests, not Lay; so Likewise must, Take, eate, this is my body; Be spoken to, and meant of Priests onely, Since both were spoke to the same men, at the Same time, and this word, All, we clearely see Omitted in the Breads delivery, And exprest in this of the Cup onely, Will this enforce; which if true, then you may As well the Bread as Cup now take away From all Lay-men; and so deprive them quite Of the Lords Supper, Bread, Wine, Priests sole right. Lay-men have right to both kinds, else to nether; Rome must then keepe back or give both together. But was it spoke to Priests onely? why then Doth Rome deny, (as well as to Lay-men) The Cup toConcil. Trident, Sessio. 21. c. 1. 2. Suriu. Tom. 4. p. 957. Priests who doe not consecrate, And by Trents Acts, leave them in Lay-mens state? Christ onely hallow'd by consent of all, The bread and wine at first; and did not call Any of his Disciples to assist Him in the consecration: yet then Christ Sayd to them;Mat. 26. 27. Drinke ye all of this; and they Mar. 14 23. All dranke thereof, as in Marke read you may. Its then against Christs precept, practise, to Deny the Cup to such Priests, as you doe; Or unto any who communicate, Since Christ words to all such alike relate. But how knowes Rome, that at this Sacrament
When first ordain'd, none but Priests were present? The Twelve were present; but than they onely Were there, no Text doth prove infallibly. But grant it true; they did not receive then As Priests, Apostles, but as Christian men And members of Christs body, Church, which they There represented; else no Priests nor Lay Men any ground had to receive the bread Or wine at all, th Christs words related Onely to the Apostles then present, To whom he spake and gave the Sacrament. Since therefore they first received bread and wine In this sense onely, as all grant, define: Then all Lay men have as good Title right Unto the Cup, as any Jesuite, Pope, Priest, or Prelate. Nor can Rome, say they, Receive them as they were Priests, but as Lay. For Rome resolved hath inSessio. 22. Can. 2. De Sa∣crificio Missae Surius. Tom. 4. p. 962. Trents Councill That the Apostles were not made Priests till After the consecration, and the bread No sacred Cup to them delivered; And that by vertue of these words; Doe this In remembrance of me; which they say is, The ground, and forme of her new Sacrament Of Orders, Priesthood. Then by Romes assent Not being Priests till these words uttered, They were Laymen whom they first receiv'd. The Bread, Wine; since Paul addes, Christ sayd, 1 Cor. 11. 25. This doe In my remembrance, after the Cup too. Which clause if it makes Masse-priests all shall be Created such Priests, who receive; which she Cannot gaine say, since all men equally Must take the bread and wine in memory Of Christ, and DOE THIS, in as ample wise As any Masse-priests: whence this will arise,
That all receivers areRev. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Priests; and therefore None must be kept from the cup any more. Adde, Paul Crists words applyeth equally To all Receivers, Priests or Laity; And makes the Cup as common unto all As is the bread. Hence he is generall Of the faithfull Jewes writes1 Cor. 10. 2. 3. 4. that they did eate ALL (as we doe) the same spirituall meate, And did ALL DRINKE, the SAME spirituall drink; For they dranke of the Rocke Christ: If you think This proofe not full enough, he writes to all The1 Cor. 1. 1. 2. Church of Corinth, Saints in generall, 1 Cor. 10. 21. Ye cannot drinke the Cup of the Lord, and The Cup of Divils, which can never stand Together) ye cannot partakers be Of the Lords Table, and partake of the Table of Devils: In which notable Text the Cup is twice1 Cor. 10. 16. 21. plac'd before the Table And sacred bread; and eke appropriated To all the faithfull, as well as the bread. He addes,1 Cor. 11. 26. 27. 28. 29. for as oft as ye this bread eate And drinke this Cup, ye the Lords death repeate And shew forth till be come: wherefore (O thinke Of this) who ere shall eate this bread and DRINKE THIS CƲP of the Lord but unworthily Shall be guilty of the blood and body Of Christ. But let a man well examine Himselfe, and so eate of that bread divine AND DRINKE of that Cup: for he that eateth AND DRINKES unworthily, eates, AND DRIN∣KETH Daation to himselfe. Christ by S. Paul Declares the Cup as common unto all As is the bread. That Laymen must it drinke As well as Priests, whence he the bread doth linke Five times together with the Cup. Cup, Bread
Eate, Drinke are still conjoyn'd not severed: All must them both receive, or both forbeare, WhatMat. 196. Christ conjoynes, none must asunder teare. All Lay men must eate, drinke, as well as Priests, Else they prove Rebles and meere Antichrists; Yea, barre themselves both from the life of grace And glory too; witnesse that noted place In John.Joh. 6. 53. 54. 55. 56. Except ye eate the flesh, AND DRINKE The blood of the Sonne of Man, (which Priests thinke Meant onely of the Sacrament, though then Not instituted, nor made knowne to men:) You have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh, AND my blood (by true faith) DRIN∣KETH, Hath life eternall, and at the last day I will raise him up: for my flesh (I say) IsChrist saith not here; the bread is my flesh indeed, as Popelings dreame, but quite contrary: My flesh is meate (to wit bread) indeed. and my blood is drinke (to wit wine) indeede: therefore if there be any transubstantia∣tion here im∣plyed, it must be of Christs body and blood into bread and wine indeed: not of bread and wine into Christs bo∣dy and blood. meate indeede, and my blood drinke indeed; (Which crosse conversion stands Rome in no steed But damnes that Transubstantiation Which she endeavours to erect hereon:) He that eateth my flesh, AND DRINKETH my Blood, dwels in me, and I in him, (onely Spiritually, not corporally.) Here Christs flesh and blood; eating, drinking, appeare Foure severall times combined: and drinking Christs blood is thrice made a most needfull thing To gaine eternall life: Nor can Rome cry, That this was spoken unto Priests onely; For 'twas spoke to the people, as is cleare By expresse words, and Christs whole discourse here. Besides, it differs10. 6. 24. 26. 23. 29. 31. 32. 34. 35. 41. 42. 43. 49. 5. 3. eating from drinking Oft times, as a distinct and diverse thing; And make both equally needfull. Therefore Rome to Lay-men the Cup must now restore; Else she will rob them of life eternall,
Of Christs blood,Object. 3. and to Hell fire damne them all. To shunne this Rocke, Rome saith,Concil. Constantiense. Sessio. 13. Surius. Tom. 3. p. 821. Concil. Trident. Sessio. 21. cap. 3. that Lay-men Drinke Christs blood in eating the dry Host: I thinke None but meere sots devoyd of reason, sense, Will be deluded with this grosse non-sense. Is any man so simple once to thinke That he Wine, Cyder, Beere, doth truely drinke In eating dry Grapes,Answ. Apples, Barly, Meate; Or that he drinkes swines blood when he doth eate Blacke puddings; and so needes not for drinke call Because he drinkes Wine, Cyder, Beere in all Reasons, Bread, Apples, meates he eates? Truely I ne're yet heard, nor read in History Of any so besotted as to thinke, That in bare eating, he did truely drinke Wine, Beare, included in dry bread onely, And eate, drink, both in one, for company. Should Priests tell Children, fooles, (than how much more Wisemen) when they eate bread, dry meates good store And then call for wine, beare, that they neede none Because they truely drinke Wine, Beere alone, In eating bread or dry meates; they would cry Forthwith, they did but them mocke, cheat, belye, And give no credit to their words at all But them meere Lyers and impostors call. Should Priests in this sort onely drinke at Table They would this shift damne as a senselesse Fable; Why are lay Papists then such blockes to thinke Their Priests speake truth, in saying that they drinke Christs Cup, blood truely, in eating dry bread?
No doubt their wits are lost; their senses fled. Should they tell Priests, or Priests tell them when as They feast at home in private, not at Masse, That they drinke wine in eating of their bread, Neither by either would be credited: How then can they beleeve they drinke truely Christs Cup, Blood, when they eate the bread onely? All know that eating is not drinking; they InSee (z) be∣fore. Job 1. 18. Mat 11. 18. 19. Luk. 10. 7. Scripture, Authors, speech, use are alway Distinct things, and still put as opposite, One to another. How then dares Rome write Or Pope decree such Nonsense, that eating Is drinking, drinking eating, both, one thing? When each man, child, foole knows the contrary, And may here justly say they erre and lye. Are they the same? why then did Christ say, Mat. 26. 26. 27. Joh. 6. 52. to 59. 1 Cor. 11. 25. to 3. Eate And drinke? yea, both of them so oft repeate, As different things? why doe Priests both eate, drinke And as to them eating no drinking thinke? If Lay-men drinke in eating, not Priests, then They can doe more than Popes, Priests, Clergie-men: If Priests in eating drinke as well as they, The Cup must then from Priests be tooke away, Lest they drinke twice for once; nay eate twice too In drinking; whereinSee () be∣fore. Rome holds her Priests doe Eate Christs body, conjoyn'd unseprably Vnto his blood; and by concomitancy Is eate in drinking. But if neither drinke In truth in eating bread, why doth Rome thinke She doth it, against Scripture, reason, sense, Christs expresse verdict, and experience? Men alwayes chew the things they eate; and they Hard, solid, dense (not liquid) things alway,
(The Objects of eating) are sayd to eate; They swallow when they drinke; not chew; not meate, Bread, solid things, but liquors, drinkes onely, The objects which men still drinke properly. Men take what they eate with hand, knife, spone: sup, Quaffe what they drinke out of some, pot, glasse, Cup. It is a contradiction then to thinke, Say, he that eates the bread, doth truely drinke The Cup thereby. O Papists now espie, Renounce Romes monstrous Nonsense, Foolery. Christ bids all eate and drinke still distinctly, Not both in one; and that successively: Mat. 26. 26 27. 28. 1 Cor. 11. 24. 25. &c. First eate the bread, next drinke the Cup, that he At first ordained, and them gave, thus the Apostles still tooke them successively In former times; but those who drinke onely In eating of the bread, doe both together In one act, moment, and doe not them sever. Christ bids menMatth. 29. 27. drinke; not eate his blood; but they Who take it in the Host, it eate alway, Not drinke at all; as men doe onely eate Blood in blacke puddings, fowles, or strangled meate, Wherein blood is contain'd: Nay he bids all Here not drinke of his blood in generall,Mat. 26. 27. 18. 1 Cor. 10. 16. 21. c. 11. 25 to 30. But specially to drinke it in the Cup And wine. Now those who onely drinke it up Within the bread; and neither Cup, wine take, Transgresse Christs precept, and his forme forsake; The Bread is not the Cup, wine: Christs body Is not his blood; these differ really One from another; then those who onely
The Body, Bread eate, cannot possibly Be sayd to drinke the Cup,Object. 4. Wine, blood thereby. This to evade, RomesSee (r) be∣fore. Doctors will reply, That Christs body under the forme of bread Containes his blood, and is accompaned Still with it; Therefore those who eate the one Doe drinke the other in it, not alone. But Christ himselfe thought not so,Answ. 1. when he the Lords Supper first ordained, sith that he Commanded all toMat. 26. 26. 27. 1 Cor. 11. 23. to 30. eate his body in The bread alone, his blood to drinke within The Cup and wine onely, not in the bread, Which he from Cup and wine distinguished. Those then who eate the body, bread onely, Can not the Cup, Wine, Blood thus drink therby As Christ enjoynes them: Nay, the Sacrament Ordain'd by Christ to this end and intent His1 Cor. 11. 25. 26. Mat. 26. 27. 28. blood-shedding and death to signifie, Is quite subverted by this Novelty: For blood within Christs Body and the Bread, Unshed, cannot Christs Passion and Blood-shed In any lively manner represent; And so cannot be a true Sacrament Of Christs death, bloodshed: who saith expresly Mat. 26. 27. 28. Mat. 19. 24. Luk. 22. 20. 1 Cor. 11. 25. 26. This Cup is the new Testament in my Blood which IS SHED for many, for pardon Of sinnes; of which there'sHeb. 9. 22. no remission Without the shedding of Christs blood;Rev. 1. 5. Heb. 9. 14. 1 John 1. 7. wherein, Whereby we are washt, cleansed from all sinne. You must then in the Sacrament, drinke up Christs blood not in his body, veines, but Cup, As shed and sever'd from his body on The Crosse; else you his bloods effusion, And sinnes remission cannot represent, By an unbloody Host or Sacrament: Which can no comfort to mens soules convey
Since it Christs blood-shed, death doth not display. Adde, that Christs body in the sacred bread Is eaten, not as living, but asLuk. 22. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 11. 24. 25. 26. Mat. 26. 26. Mat. 14. 24. dead, Nail'd, broken on the Crosse; quite voyd of blood, All shed out of his body for our good; As three Evangelists, Saint Paul, and he Expressely witnesse. His blood can't then be Drinke, taken in his body, which is dead, And out of which his blood is wholly shed? Besides, admit his blood inclos'd to lye▪ Within the Host, and Veines of his body; Yet since none drinke, but eate the Host alway, And eating is not drinking; none can say That those who onely eate the Host, body, Doe drinke the blood in truth, or properly. More; Rome takes that for granted which she can Not prove; nor all the learning, wit of man Make good; that Christs true Body, Blood com∣binde Are in each Host received in their kinde, And proper substance: A grosse forgery: For grant Christs blood be there substantially, (Which I deny) it is still there as shed Within the Cup, Wine onely, not the Bread. This Christ himselfe resolves. Its then most cleare That those who eate the bread onely don't there In Christs blood eate, or drinke in any kinde; But grant they doe it: did Christ himselfe minde, Know, understand this Crochet when as he Ordain'd the Sacrament, or not? if ye Say no: then how come you now to know more, And understand that Christ knew not before? And that in point of his presence, being In the Sacraments of Bread, Wine; the thing Which he himselfe ordain'd, and so should know Far better then; than Rome, you can doe now;
Unlesse you make Christ ignorant, and so No God at all. But if he knew it tho, That those who eate the bread doe really Therein his blood drinke, and receive; than why Did he ordaine the Cup, and commandMat. 26. 27. 28. ALL To drinke of it, in such a speciall Strict manner? which had beene superfluous, Had all within the bread his blood drunke thus. Sith then Christ did ordaine the Sacrament In both kindes, and gave expresse Commandment That all should drinke his sacred blood, as shed, Within the Cup, wine onely, not the bread, I may conclude, (sith Christ did nought in vaine) That the dry Host doth not Christs blood con∣taine; And that those who the body, bread onely Eate, cannot therein drinke Christs blood truely. Rome then Christs Cup to Lay-men must restore, And with these non-sense lyes, them cheate no more. To say,Object. 5. the Scripture speakes ofLuk. 24. 85 Act. 2. 46. c. 20. 7. See Doctor Featly his Grand Sacriledge, c. 12. p. 148. breaking bread Onely, in some Texts, the Cup not named; Therefore they did receive the bread onely Without the Cup: Is an absurdity, Since eating, breaking bread doth there imply A full repast, with meate, drinke, wine, not dry Bread onely without drinke:Answ. hence when we pray Mat. 6. 11. Give us this day our dayly bread; all say, Professe we therein pray for wine, drinke, and All things of which our Bodies in neede stand. But say these texts be meant of bread onely, And of the Sacrament, (which I deny:) Without the Cup or Wine, yet they imply Not as Rome dreames, that eating properly Is drinking, and that those who eate the bread Doe therewith drinke Christs blood in veines, or shed;
The thing in question; or that Priests onely Must drinke the Cup; but proves the contrary; That both Priests, people, must the Cup forbeare, Because in these Texts no Cup, Wine, appeare At all: and that Priests may well consecrate Bread without Wine, sith these Texts nominate No Cup nor wine them used; Rome must take The Cup away quite,Object. 6. or these Texts forsake. The(v)(f) See Joan. Gerson, defensio De creti Concil. Constant. Inconveniences she doth pretend To justifie her theft, are to no end. Since Christ, no doubt, did them foresee, as well As Rome,Answ. yet none did from the Cup repell; Rome then must be more carefull, wise, than he, Or else disclaime these shifts,Incon. 1. which idle be. The danger, lest some drops of it should shed; Is common to the crums of Sacred bread, As well as to the Cup; which Priests shed may As soone as Laicks, and as(x)(c) Gratian de Consecr. distinct 2. c. Si quis per libr. Sunima An∣gelica Eucha∣ristia. 3. Sect. 43. Casuists say, In drunken sits may chance to vomit up Christs blood they dranke out of the Sacred Cup. Whence Rome hath made Decrees for to redresse This mischiefe, in the case of Priests excesse; So that Rome must both of the Cup deprive, Or it alike to Priests and People give. The next pretext,Inconv. 2. of the wines waxing soure, Is vaine, since no wine in one day or houre Will putrifie, much lesse Christs blood: and bread As well as wine will mould, be corrupted: Yet you reserve it in a Pix, not wine,Inconv. 3. Till it grow stale: you must this shift decline. The danger of its sticking on the beard Of those that drinke, was never thought of, heard In former times by any; and you may With better colour shave mens beards away (As you doeSee Cyprian Valerian de Sa∣cerdotum babis. Priests for this cause) then deny The Cup to them, lst their beards it come nigh.
However, since youths, women, beardlesse men Have no Beards to steale Christs blood; you must then To all these give the Cup and yet deny To none but men with beards; on which truely Since crummes of bread may chance to sticke, as well As drops of wine:Incom. 4. Rome now must them repell Alike from both: That some want wine, therefore Rome may the Cup take from those who have store; Is most absur'd: and she may likewise say The bread must be from all sorts tooke away That have bread; because some Countries have, eate No bread at all, but live on rootes, fish, meate. But where no wine is, there Priests, Laity, Are both alike; none drinke, both are still dry. That some loath and can taste no wine,Incom. 5. therefore Those who can drinke it, must not drinke it more, Is most ridiculous: some love not bread, Must none then with the sacred bread be fed? If so, then neither Priests nor Laity Must henceforth to Christs Supper once draw nigh. The danger of infection some pretend,Incom. 6. Romes Transubstantiation doth quite end, For if the bread and wine be really Christs body, blood, they cannot certainely Receive, nor yet convey infection To any; nor reade I that any one Tooke any sicknesse (Poxe, Plague, Leprosie) By drinking Christs Cup in sincerity As he commandeth: Nay, Christ who cures all Kindes of diseases, will not let them fall On such who thus obey his Sacred will, But will preserve them from Contagion still.
Adde, that the bread may be infectious Through Priests, Clarkes, Bakers, hands, nay poy∣sonous As well as the Cup, Wine, blood, forJean. Cre∣spin & Grim∣ston, in Henry the 7. Platina & Balus in Victor. 3. Henry The seventh (Emperour) was poysoned by Bernard, and Victor the third in the bread, AsMat. Paris, An. 115. p. 8. Henry of Yorke, KingSee Speedes History. p. 587. John were poysoned With the Cup, by Monkes and Clergie men: Neither of both are Christs body, blood then, But bread and wine for substance: and if you This inconvenience further will persue, You must the bread as well as wine remove, Since both (through Priests meanes) may infecti∣ous prove.Incom. 7. Paul saith, he1 Cor. 11. 27. 29. that eates, drinkes unworthily Eates, drinkes, damnation to himselfe thereby; If then this greater danger must not drive Men from Christs Supper; nor good men deprive Thereof, though certaine: this lesse danger you Pretend, but casuall, not like to ensue, Must not debarre the people from drinking The Cup: Much lesse the plea of differing The Clergie from the publike Laity: For since Christ forRev. 1. 5. 1 Joh. 2. 2. 3. Mat. 26. 27. 28. both equally did dye And shed his blood; yea, the1 Cor. 10. 16. 21. c. 11. Cup to both give Aike; none must them of this right deprive. Tis more than devillish pride for to deny Laickes the Cup, to rayse Priests dignity, And to subvert Christs very Sacrament, (Which bread alone cannot well represent) Yea hurt mens soules, to Mount Masse-Priests on high And them advance above the Laity. To close up all: RomesComperimus autem quod qui∣dam sumpta tan∣tummodo corpo∣ris sacri porti∣one, a Calice Sacrati cruoris abstineant, qui proculdubio quo∣niam nescio qua superstitione do∣centur astringi) aut integra Sa∣cramenta perci∣piant, aut ab in∣tegris arceantur; quia divisio uni∣us ejusdem{que} my∣sterit SINE GRANDI SA∣CRILEGIO esse non potest. Apud Gratia∣num. De Con∣secrat▪ Dist. 2. Pope Gelasius In his unerring chaire determin'd thus; In this same case, long since, (when some onely
Would take the Sacred bread, and then deny The sacred Cup to drinke, because they were Perswaded wine was ill, and did forbeare It onely from this superstition:) That Priests such people with great caution, Should cause to take both Elements intire, Or drive them from both: If you now desire His reason, marke it well: Because that one And the same very Sacrament alone Can no way possibly divided be Without GREAT SACRILEDGE. In which De∣cree, Rome these particulars, well worthy note, May see defin'd against herSessio 13. Surius. Tom. 4. p. 821. 822. Constans vote. First, that lay people in the Eucharist Must drinke the Cup still, as well as the Priest. Next, that the Manichees did first invent The halfe Communion, and halfe Sacrament. Because they thought wine in it selfe to be Unlawfull. Thirdly, that by this Decree Mens false perswasion in their conscience That wine is simply ill, must not dispence With, nor exempt them from the sacred Cup But they must drinke it here, or else not Sup With Christ at all, nor taste his bread and body: Whence I against Romes Church shall pleade strongly; That if those who thought wine in conscience Unlawfull, must yet drinke it in plaine sense Within the Cup, not bread, at Sacrament, Or else be from the bread, and Church out-pent, And quite secluded: Then much more must they Who deeme Wine lawfull, not be kept away From the Lords Cup; but drinke it punctually; Nay be for'st to receive it constantly If they refuse it: and by this decree
Eating to be no drinking, all may see. Next that Popes, Prelates, Masse-Priests, must compell All to drinke of Christs Cup, or else repell, Them from the Sacred bread. But Romes Clergie, Popes, Prelates, Priests de now quite contrary: Compelling Laymen to eate bread alone, Vsually suffring not so much as one Of them to drinke the Sacred Cup: nay the Councells ofIpsa sancta Synodus decer∣nit Patriarchis, Primatibus, Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, &c. processus esse. dirigendos ut effectualiter puniant eos. qui communi∣cando populum sub utraque spe∣cie panis & vi∣ni exhortati fu∣erint, & sic faciendum esse docuerint, & si ad paenitenti∣am redierint, ad gremium Ecclesiae susci∣piantur, injuncta eis pro modo culpae poenitentia salutari. Qui vero ex illis ad poeni∣tentiam redire non curaverint animo indurato, per censuras Ecclesiasticas per eos ut HAERETICI sunt coercendi, invocato etiam ad hoc (si opus fuerit) auxi∣lio brchii secularis. Concil. Constantiense, Sessio 13. Surius. Tom. 3. p. 822. Constans, and Trent, Thus decree: That if any Priest shall exhort Laymen To take the Sacrament in both kinds, then For this offence, or if he admit any Thus to receive, he shall be presently Excommunicated; and if that he Perssist herein, he shall condemned be And censur'd as an Hereticke: yeaQua propter dicere quod hanc consuetudinem aut legem observare, sit SA∣CRILEGIƲM, aut illicitum, censeri debe erroneum; & per tinaciter asse∣rentes oppositum praemissorum, tanquam HAERETICI, arcendi sunt & gravi∣ter puntendi, &c. Ibidem. Lay Men, who shall be so bold as once to say As this Pope doth, that it is SACRILEDGE, Ʋnlawfull, or erronious to abridge Them of the Cup, shall for this cause onely Be persecuted, punisht grievously As Heretickes. O strange, prodigious Decrees; quite crosse to Pope Gelasius! Fiftly, that those who eate the Host onely Drinke not Christs blood inclos'd in his body; Nor take they the whole Sacrament, but it Divide in halfe, and into peeces split:
WhichSessio. 13. Suris Tom. 3. p. 821. 822. Constans &Sessio. 13. De Eucharisticae Sacr. Can. 3. Surius. Tom 4. 935. 936. Trent Councels both deny, Belike they love truth, Popes to contrary. Sixthly, that not one element alone, But both together taken by each one, Christs bloody death compleately represent; And make up one intire sweete Sacrament. In fine, that none can sever or divide The bread and Wine, or put the Cup aside Taking the bread alone, or give it to Lay men without the Cup, (as Priests now doe) Without GREAT SACRILEDGE: And if that they Who thinke wine ill in point of conscience, may Nor here the Sacred wine refuse to drink Without great Sacriledge; then all must thinke Those Sacrilegious in the top degree Who deeme wine lawfull, and will drinke it free In Tavernes, and all places else, but here In Christs owne Supper it forbid, forbeare.

If that you give to both like Reverence, Not worship; God no doubt will take offence That you give like and equall veneration To him and Altars; it's no Christian fashion; Nor courtly neither, for if any one Should equall worship give to King and Throne, And both at once in selfe-same sort adore He would be trust up, or thrust out of doore.

We have no reason than to turne our face To any Altar, Table, Church or Place On Earth, when as we pray; but still to move And lift our hearts, hands, eyes, to heaven above, Where God and ChristPsal. 103. 19.

But you to your Altars bow commonly, When as no sacred Elements there lye, And Christ's not on them, so that you adore The Altars, Tables onely, and no more. Yea;Reply but though Christ be not there present then, Yet he's sometimes there; therefore asWiddows, Shelford, and others make this objecti∣on, use this similitude. See my Quench-coale, p. 55, 56, 57. 38. to 44. 277. to 284 most men At Court, doe use to bow to chaires of state, Because that Kings in them sometimes have sate, Though absent when they bow; so we likewise Bow when there are no signes before our eyes. Well said,Answ. I now see whence your conges came;
It was from Court, from whence you learnt the same, But not from Gods Court, but the Kings; so then It is a worship not from God, but men; Yea, its no more but a Court complement: To court, not serve God then, is your intent. I doubt you meane to turne meere Courtiers now, And therefore practise, thus to Congie, bow Unto the Altar, Table, that thereby You may be perfect in Court ceremony, Against you resort thither, for to finde Or seeke preferment: now I know your minde: Those who would rise high, must first stoope, and bow; I feele your pulses, and your tempers know: But pray you shew me, where God ever sent Men to the Court, to learne to complement With him in his owne Temple? or that he With Courtly complements will served be, Which all deeme fained, grosse hypocrisie; Take heed you prove not hypocrites thereby; But say that some to chaires of State thus bow, When Kings are absent; wisemen doubtlesse know That this is nothing but Court adulation; Such then must be your Courtly adoration. It is a custome; true, yet voyd of reason; WhichIgens au∣tem est vesania eorum qui talia dicunt. Nam rex purpuram indu∣tus, ab omnibus adoratur; nun∣quid ergo pur∣pura adoratur, aut Rex? mani∣festum est quod Rex: Vbi vero Rex hanc exut, & in locum re∣posuit, non am∣plius vestis purpura adoratur. Sedet etiam in templo sape Rex in proprio Thron, & adoranes adorant regem in templo ac throno proprio; Vbi vero surrexit Rex, ne∣mo neque Templum neq, thronum adorat. Nemo autem adeo insanus est, ut adorare volens Regem in Throno, dicerad Regem, Surgeex Throno ut te adorem; sed adorat Regem cum Throno. Epiphanius, lib. Anchoratus, Col. 970. 971. some omit, and yet commit no treason. Should men adore each place where Kings have set, They must their senses, or themselves forget; Yea, thus to congie when the Kings are gone,
Is but to mocke the Kings, and grace their Throne. It is meere folly, frenzie too, I feare, To now to chaires, because Kings once sate there. But be this as it may, no chaire of State Is bow'd to, but that wherein Kings once sate In person, not in picture onely; True, Hence see your sottish folly; then must you Bow to no Altars, Tables henceforth; Why? Because Christ nere sate on them really In person, but in figure, picture; ye By this your instance quite confounded be: Its just with God mens reason to confound, When they make Reason, not his Word, their ground. But grant you further, that Christ's present in The sacred bread and wine; yet still you spin A greater thread of solly, and insnare Your selves more fast, as I shall next declare. For first, no Tables, Altars touch, containe, Immediately, the sacred bread and wine; But onely hold the vessels, Paten, Cup, (As Tables doe our dishes when we sup) Which the bread, wine, containe in them alone; They therefore (if ought) are Christs chaire, and Throne, Wherein he sits; Altars but theirSee 1 Chron. 28 2. Psal. 99. 5 Psal. 132. . am 2. 1. where the Arke and Temple, are stiled Gods Footstoole, not his Throne or chaire of state. footestooles, Or Christs at least: why play you then the fooles To bow to Altars, Tables, as Christs Throne, Not Cup, or Paten, where he sits alone? All Altars, Tables, are but stone, or wood; These vessels silver, gold, not neere so good As these for matter, substance; and in end, They, Tables, Altars, in worth farre transcend, Made purposely these vessels to sustaine, Which the blest bread and wine in them containe; Therefore more worthy Congies and respect.
Why bow you then to those, yet these neglect? If there be any reason to encline To ought, its to these vessels; the bread, wine: Yet see more folly, you bow to the Table, When these are in your hands, count these a fable, And Christ within them [as you hold.] And here You are most grosse Idolaters, I feare; For when you hold these & Christ in your hand, You bow to Altars, whereon neither stand: Did you thus bow to Christ, as you pretend, You would not to your naked Altars bend, When he is in your hands, contained in These vessels: here you faulter, erre, and sin; As you doe likewise, when you bow, adore Towards the Altar, Tables, just before You goe to consecrate the Sacrament, Ere Christ's there present in the Element: You should (me thinkes) not bow, but stay till he By consecration should there present be. Yet one bout more; the bread and wine you say, Are, or containe Christs body, blood; and they Are better, greater than Gods sacred word: Why doe you then bow to the Altar, Board, Not to the Bread, Wine, Christ, nay them neglect, When in your hands, to turne, bow with respect Unto meere naked Tables, Altars? sure Your wits are lost, and Christ will not endure To see a stone, or planke ador'd, whilst he, Then in your hands, must not thus worshipt be. By this all know it is a truth, no fable, That you adore not Christ thus, but the Table, Or Altar, else you would not to them bow, Whilst you hold Christ within your hands. Then now At last discerne your folly, and pretend No more, you worship Christ; you him offend:
And since nought in the Sacrament presents Christ to us, but the Sacred Elements, You must your Altar-worship quite give o're, And nought but them (if ought) henceforth adore. And yet the signes, are not so venerable, As is each Saints heart, whereinEphes. 3. 17 2 Cor. 13. 5. Psal. 2. 20. 2 Cor. 6. 15. Christ doth dwell In farre more lively, reall manner, then In bread, wine, Altars, made for holy men. Christs reall presence is in these alone, 2 Cor. 12. 12. 37 1 Cor. 6 15. 19. Eph. 5. 30.

If this displease, to give you some content, Me thinkes your Priests, by office reverent, Who hallow, hold, take, give the sacred bread And wine to all, should be more worshipped Then your bare Altars, sith they1 Cor. 10. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 20 Gal. 4. 14. represent Christs person, who blest, gave this Sacrament At first: are Altars (senselesse wood or stone) More sacred, worthy then Priests? who alone Neglected are, not bow'd to then by you; Doubtlesse, if bowing be to either due, It is to Priests [your name] or if you will, ToCol. 1. 23. 24. 1 Thes. 3. 1. 1 Tim 4. 6. 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2 Cor 3. 6.

Baruch 6. senselesse stocks, or stones They unto Altars turne, and bow their bones, Whereas, if Altars, Tables, had but sence, Life, they would bow and doe them reverence. For shame then be not stocks, or fooles henceforth But know your selves, your office, place, state, worth And no more cracke your braines to justifie Gestures, that strip you of your dignity, And senses both at once, as you must see, And now confesse, unlesse you senselesse be: Where Christ's more truely present on the Altar Then in the Priests; the Priests deserve an halter; And I shall deeme that man a stocke or stone, Who bowes to Altars, lets the Priests alone. O Priests consider well of what I say, And then in this you will not say me nay: But if you doe, and Altars still adore, Ile not spend breath to plead a Priests cause more. But ere we part, once more to Church wee'l tend; Why doe you not to Font, Pue, Pulpit bend, As well as Altars, Tables? since in these Christ is more present in his Ordinances, Then on these, in most Churches, places where Baptisme, Lords Supper, Sermons frequent are: In these each weeke, day, Christ is constantly Present; on Altars, Tables, quarterly, Or monethly at the most; he then resides More in the Pulpit, Font, than ought besides. You hold, thatMatth. 28. 15. 16. Iohn 3. 3. 5 Rom. 10. 13 14. 15. Baptisme, yea, and Gods word too, Are simply needfull men to save; but so Is not the Eucharist, as all agree; They then more usefull, worthy, needs must be. These two save men alone, but t'other not, The greatest reverence then you should allot To Pulpits, Fonts, whence these dispensed are, Than to the Altars, where Christ is more rare.
But let these passe; you cannot this deny, That Bibles farre surpasse in dignity, Fonts, Altars, Tables, Churches, Pulpits, all; Which without Gods word, to the ground wil fal; This is theirEphes. 2. 20, 21. sole foundation, if it fade, All else without it, is nought but meere shade; Both Table, Pulpit, Church, Font, Sacrament: Of all these then Gods word's most excellent; In it Gods Spirit, Christ, grace, more reside Then in all places of the Church beside; If then you will adore, bow, cringe at all, You must unto, before Church-Bibles fall: Your Altar-bowings, while you these neglect, With God and good men will finde no respect. In fine, Christ's promise is, where two or three In his name meete together, he will be Mat. 18. 20 Luk. 24. 3. Re. 5 6 Joh. 20. 13. 26. c 19. 26.

To say then that Christ sits upon the Table As you now place it, is no doubt a Fable: For it stands not in midst of Church, Quire, but Against the Chancels East-wall, there up shut Close prisoner, with a new raile, remote from The Congregation, which now must not come Nor have seats neare it: it's aLaici juxta Altare non sedeant, nec inter cle∣ricos stae vel sedere praesumant, sed pars illa quae cancellis ab Altari dividitur, tan∣tum psallentibus pteat cleicis.

If then God, Christ, midst Church and people be, As by forequoted Scriptures you may see, Your Tables, Altars, which now stand alone Far from the Churches midst, are not their Throne: If you will have them grac'd with their presence You must remove them to the midst from thence, Where they are present; else they will still set, Besides these Thrones,Object. whose due place you forget.

Belike our Priests and Prelates learnt from hence To bow to their new Altars; since I find This Saint theHe dyed Anno 1275. first, who Altars in this kind Adored; yet not constantly, but when He whipt himselfe; in nights, not dayes. If then Our Novellers will imitate him, they Must whip themselves, ere they bow; and in day Time quite forbeare this Complement; and use It but at night: Both these they will refuse. I read, SaintSurius Tom. 5. vita Francis∣ci ex Bonaven∣tura. c. 8. et Du∣ralt Iesuit Flores Exemp c. 5. tit. 6. Francis the Fryer, exhorted A Cade-Lambe (for he to Beasts, Birds, Preached Oft-times;) to be attentive to Gods praise; And hereupon, this holy Lambe alwayes After, the Church frequented every day, And without any Tutor (as they say)
Kneeled before the Altar of our Lady, At the Hosts elevation; (marke you why) In honour of her Maker;O discant haeretici vel a pecude venera∣ri matrem Christi, et Eu∣charistiam ado∣rare. Ibidem. Surius Who doth relate this history to us, Writes; O let heretiques learne to adore The blessed Sacrament, and bow before It, by this Lambes example: happily Our Altar Worshippers were lesson'd by This silly Lambes example, to kneele, bow, Adore before their Altars, Tables now; And worship them, and Christ, who sitteth on Them (asShelfold, Wid∣dowes, Heylin, Archbishop Laud; and Dr. Pocklington, in their places forcited. they write) as in his Chaire or Throne: But then they should, like this Lambe, kneele only, And bow thus, when they lift the Host on high; And that not to the Altar, but the Host: Should they this doe yet, their designe were lost, Wherefore, I doubt, these Wolves inMatth 7. 15. sheepes-clothing, Have rather from two Asses learn't this thing, Famous in Popish Legends, who before The Host, and Altar kneeled, to adore Them. The first was, theRihadeniera Fleures des ves des Saints. p. 1. pag. 563. Asse of Bouivil, Kept three dayes fasting, who of her Free-will Forsooke her provender for to adore The Host her Maker, brought and held before Her by Saint Anthony; which miracle P. 95. Already toucht more largely) wrought so well, That it her owne did Convert, nay, more, Teach Catholickes the host for to adore. I wonder why theMatth. 21. 2. to 10. Mar. 11. 1. to 11. Asse which Christ rode on Into Jerusalem, fell not upon Her knees, her Makers person to adore, When as this Asse fell on her knees before This Host, which did but onely represent His body. Sure some leud Fryer did invent This Legend; or this Asse was tutored Like Bankes his horse, to kneele thus to the bread,
To cheate the vulgar, and make them adore The Host, like this Asse, for their Creator; Else that Asse whereon Christ rode, would as well As this, have to him on her knees downe fell. In memory whereof Saint Anthony Holding the Host, and this Asse kneeling by Thereto, are graven on the high Altar At Padua, where this hap'ned, or not far From thence. But this devout Asse did adore The Host, not Altar; but once, and no more. Those then who bow to Altars frequently, Transcend this Asse in devout foolery; And the next Asse, or Mule; which, as I read, FromRibadenie∣ra Fleures, &c. part 1. p. 151. Andelousa in Spaine carryed The reliques of Saint Bernard, Accurse, and Three Martyrs more, slaine by the cruell hand Of Pagan Moore in Morrocco, unto (If you beleeve the Legend which writes so) Conimbri, by Gods conduct directly; And went to the Gate of the Monast'ry Of Saint Crosse, where the Canons Regular Of Saint Austin reside; and staying there Ʋntill' the gates were opened to her, she Went in first, King Alphonsus, is Queene, the Whole Court, and multitudes then following her In great procession, to the high Altar; Before which she kneel'd downe, and would not stirre Thence, untill they had quite discharged her Of these Saints reliques she thus carryed; Which, for a miracle is registred. This devout Asse, who kneeled thus before This Altar, taught our Asse-priests to adore And bow before their Altars constantly: Yet the but once, and that prodigiously Thus kneeled; they, in this her farre transcend, In that they to their Altars daily bend,
Without a miracle, and them adore; Whereas she did, not kneele to, but before The Altar; not in to rev'rence, or pray To God; but there her burden downe to lay. Those then who bow to Altars, farre surpasse Saint Francis Lambe, Bonivils, and this Asse In fond devotion; Beasts, Sheepe, Asses, Mules Acts, in Gods worship, must not be mens rules; As Rome now makes them, butPsal. 119. 9 Iohn 5. 39.
