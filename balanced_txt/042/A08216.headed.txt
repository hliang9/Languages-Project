BEholde and consider, how that now in ye last Tyme, the Loue is appeer∣ed vppon the Earth with her Safemak∣ing-seruice / to the Lyfe of Men, in the Godlynes: also com vnto vs Little and Humbleones, for to minister thesame: and how that{reversed ;} ☜in the Beleeuing and Obeying of the Requyring of thesame Ser∣uice of Loue; the verytrue Ioh. 1.8.b Light of Lyfe, and the vpright Beeing of Iesu Christ, i risen-vp vn∣to vs 2. Corin. .a. in our Hearts. With the which, and in the which / the vpright Beeing of the pure Mat. 22.c. Luk. 1.f. Eph. 1.4.b. Righte∣ousnes of God the Father the vpright Beeing of the true Ioye and Ephe. 2 b. Peace of Iesu Christ the vp∣right Beeing of the true euerlasting Lyfe of the Loue or holy Gost and the vpright Beeing of our inwarde Mynde, is likewyse {reversed ;}by Gods Grace; inherited of vs. 2. Through which Grace that is thus chaunced vnto vs from the vncouered 1 Cor. 13.b 2. Cor. 3.b. Face of God and Christ, wee doo {reversed ;}through the Loue and the Re∣quyring of her Seruice; call and bydd all Louers of thesame vpright Beeing, Math. 22.a. Luk. 14.b therunto / for that they mought all {reversed ;}through the Requnring of our gracious Seruice of Loue; enter into the verytrue Ier. 31.d. Heb 5.10 c Sainetnary of thesame vpright Beeing and so
haue their fellowshipp with Vs. For through thatsame Sainctuary of God {reversed ;}being com vnto vs in the Spirit; wee 1. Ioh 1.a. haue our fellowshipp with God the Father with the Lorde Iesu Christ and with the Holy Gost and all ye Holyones of God, in the Kingdom of the Heauenly Beeing Apost. 12.21.a. full of all Bewty of the Spirituall and heauenly Goodes. Of which Kingdom also, wee do publish a ioyeful Mar. 14.b Apo 14.2. Message, to the Spreeding-abrode of thesame, in all the Worlde / for a Testimony vnto all People, that the Coming of thesame vpright and verytrue Beeing, is ye Consummation [namely, the Whole Somme or Fulfilling] of all Thatt / which is Act 3 c. Ephe. 1.b. written touching the Godlynes in Iesu Christ. and touching the Daye of the Declaring of all thesame. 3. For thissame Daye Mal. 4.a. of the great Light from Heauen {reversed ;}wherin it is all declared and brought vn∣to Vs, what soeuer is of God and of Christ; is the true Daye of Loue / which the God of Heauen hath heertofore / when Hee commanded all Men, in euery Quarter / to Repent, appoynted to be a Act. 17.c. Day of his Iudgment: and hath also {reversed ;}out of his Grace and mercifull Loue / towardes all People that haue a desyer to doo his Will; made-knowen vnto Vs with thesame / the first Math. 3.2.16 c. Luk. 13.14.c. Act. 2.3.c. Entrance into the peaceable Waye Pro. 4 h. Mat 19 e. that reacheth to the euerlast∣ing Lyfe. and the verytrue Trueth of God, Iohn. 8.c that maketh free: and nakedly declared the euerlasting Lyfe, as a verytrue Light of vpright Righteous∣nes: and brought the Sweetnes of the louely Bee∣ing of God vnto Vs, in all Loue / wherby to de∣clare
now likewyse in the last tyme / Gods vpright Righteousnes / vnto the Goodwillingones: and {reversed ;}in the Requyring of the Loue; to make all that knowen Ephe 3.a. Colo. 1.. vnto them, which extendeth ther-vnto. 4. Forasmuch now therfore / as that this Daye of the great Light from Heauen, is com vnto Vs, in the Obeying of the Requyring of the Loue / so perceaue wee now also in thesame Daye, and it shall likwyse in thesame, becom knowen {reversed ;}in the Spirit; vnto all Louers of the Trueth, that ther is no Waye / easyer, more peaceable, nor ioyfull to walke-in, then the Waye of Peace / which vnder the Obedience of the Loue, is taught Esa 2.a. Luk. 1.g. and poynt∣ed - on out of the gracious Woorde of the Lorde (but yet is it loued of Fewe: and much lesse knowen and Math. 7.. walked-in:) neither-yet also that ther-is any∣thing, more sweete or louely, then the Lyfe of the Loue, which proceedeth out of God, and that is inherited in the Seruice of Loue: yet is thesame {reversed ;}through Ignorance; disdayned of Many. For∣that-cause it remayneth likewyse couered 2. Cor. 4.b. or hid∣den before Many. 5. Which Misunderstanding, or ignorant Ephe. 4.b Blyndnes, the Man hath inherited / decause that hee is more inclyned to the Esa. 59.b. Rom. 5.b. Estrainging from his God and to the Declyning from the Requyr∣ing of the Loue / then to liue in his God or to be obedient vnto him in the gracious Woorde of his Loue. For-that-cause also, the Man loueth much-more, his vayne and corrupted Lyfe, which hee himself taketh-on {reversed ;}the which notwith standing is nothing but sa. 9.a. troublesom and deadly vnto him;
then the louely Lyfe of Peace, wherunto God Co. .a. hath crated and loued the Man: and so hee cleau∣eth-vnto or followeth much-more, his taken-on knowledg, Rom. 1.c. Colo. 2.c. Self-wisdom, and manly Learning / proceeding out of the Flesh / then the Trueth of Lyfe, which is witnessed . Pet. 1.c. out of the Mouth of God, or brought-forth by God. 6. BVt the greatest Darknes and erring Blyndnes, wherwith the Man is most∣of all captiued is this: That hee himself taketh-on Rom. 1.c. a knowledg so arrogantly / and so perswadeth himself, that hee vnoweth somthing of the godly Things / ereuer that God Ioh. 14.c. with his Christ / haue his Dwelling or a liueing Gal. 4.c. Foorme in him: For veryly / all the Mans Knowledg and Vnderstand∣ing, together with all his Descerning or Perceau∣ing of the Trueth / ought to stand Ephe. 3.c. grounded in the liuing God and in his Christ or woorde of Lyfe: and not to take on him / any-maner of Knowledg of the godly Things / without God or his Christ. 7. But seeing now, that it standeth not so with many Men: as also that they do not {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue; giue-ouer themselues good-willingly to the Incorporation Ihn. 15. Rom. 6..a. vnto God and Christ, nor-yet stand submitted therunto: but that they all for the most part / do respect and fol∣low their owne goodthinking Deut. 12 9 Ier. 7 9 1.13 18. Knowledg / for the Trueth / Therfore is likewyse all the Knowled and Discerning therof / proceeding out of the Lye, and out of the Deuill / Iohn. 1. the Father of Lyes: and
all their Wayes that they walke in / Sap. 5.. are meere Errour and Darknes. 8. THerfore is the goodthinking Knowledg of the Trueth, or the knowledg of the godly Things ▪that one taketh on him / without the gra∣cious Moorde or the Incorporating to thesame / or Ioh. 10. before the Appeering or Comming of Iesu Christ and of the Kingdom of God; the most hor∣rible Spirit act. 12.13.17. of the false Prophets / which sedu¦ceth the Man most-of-all, and bringeth him into Errour: and maketh him biynde touching the vp∣right Vnderstanding of God, and touching the true Discerning of the Lyfe and of the euerlast∣ing Trueth. 9. For ther-through the Man turneth himself awaye from the right Waye of the louely and ioy∣full Lyfe and Peace: and hee falleth or strayeth in∣to a By-waye of the vngodly and deadly Beeing: wherin ther cometh vnto him, manye Esa 59.  Sap. 5.a. Troubles and Calamities, many Miseries, Paynes, and greefs of Heart, and many Afflictions and Com∣bered Thoughts, all which do stretch to the Di∣struction: and so hee walketh in the Sap. 5. tedious Wayes, which are full of Darknesse, and do leade to the Mat. 7.b. Condemnation. 10. O Yee Deerly-beloued, seeing now that I / through the Light of Lyfe {reversed ;}which is apeered 2. Cot. 4.a. in my Heart / out of the heauenly Trueth; do see and percaeue all the Mans Cala∣mitee and Misery, Esa. 13.a. 4 . and all the Aduersitee that is comming vppon him [namely, through his Blyndnes and erring Darknes, and through all
the Vnquietnes and Misunderstanding, om. 7.b. wheer∣under hee {reversed ;}through his taken-on Knowledg; is captiued and bounde, and wherunto he hath ▪wil∣lingly; geeuen-ouer himself] So am I greatly moued with Compassion towardes the erring Man / for his ignorant Blyndnes cause / and very∣much troubled and combred in my Heart, about him: and haue for-that-cause {reversed ;}to thend that I mought happly by som meanes, bring him to Esa. 59.b. p. 3.c. ye Knowing of himself, and of his Errour; witnes∣sed and figured-out, and setfoorth in Ryme ▪euen out of harty Loue; this Inuention of an Enter∣lude / of the Mans Fall, of his Errour, and of the taking-on of his Owne-wills Chooseing / for that hee, or eneryone that heareth or readeth thesame / shoulde ▪ther-through; euidenly vnderstande and consider, which is the cause of the Mans Vnquiet∣nes: and what Vanitee or Foolishnes, the Chil∣dren of Men do take-on of themselues, to their great Burdening: and wherwith they do bring themselues into muth Calamitee and Greefe against one-another. All the which / is playnly shewed and testifyed ▪in enterlude-maner; in this Inuencion of a Playe of Myndes. 11. Concerning which Inuention of thissame Plane: wheerin small clerckly-skyll is sheewed; I shall desyer of the good-willing Reader / ye hee will not stumble therat, because thesame is so playne a Worke: nor - yet reiect or dispise {reversed ;}therfore; the groundly Signification or the Substance therof. 12. For it is not brought-foorth or witnessed / for a howe or commendaeion of artificiall Skill of
Rethorick: but much-rather / Ephe. 4.a to further all Con∣corde in the Loue / for to shewe euenso through the same Playe, how that the Children of Men haue turned them awaye from the louely Sap. 1.b. Lyfe of the Kingdom of God / and from the Gal. 3.a. Trueth of Iesu Christ: and how that they like wyse, are turned vnto themselues seduced Rom. 1.c. Ephe. 4.b. by their owne Know∣ledg blynded in their Vnderstanding and {reversed ;}tho∣rough Vnregarding, and Good-thinking; are falne into much Diuision and many Errours. Because that they shoulde then {reversed ;}through the Knowing of their Estrainging from the King∣dom of God; turne them agayne vnto God, and to the Kingdom of God and his Esa. 1.e. 55 Ier. 3.4.. Eze. 18.33. Ioel. 2.e Righteousnes and liue in all Loue and Peace. 13. WHerfore {reversed ;}yee Deerly-beloued; haue a good regarde to the Intent and Re∣presentation of thissame Playe: and note well / how that the Fall of Man, and his Distruction, as likewyse his Opinion or Good-thinking / is witnessed and shewed in thesame Playe (as well in the Wisdom of his Scripture-learnednes, as in his Playnes or Simplenes) so shall yee then {reversed ;}with small labour; vnderstande or perceaue / how that the Esa. 5.c. Ier. 7.11.c 13.a. Goodthinking hath {reversed ;}with his Misunderstanding; gotten the Superioritee, and raigneth euery wheare, ouer the Children of Men: euen as well ouer the Wyse of the Worlde Math. 12.15.23. 1. Cor. 1. Act. 7.22.23.24. and Scripture-learnedones {reversed ;}which bost them of the Knowledge of the Trueth, and of the Wis∣dom of Vnverstanding; as ouer Ier. 5.a. the Little and
Simpleones, or Ignorant-sort / which must be ledd, taught, and instructed. 14. Now when ye haue looked into and vnder∣stood all thissame / so may ye then likewyse / see and vnderstand rightly and according to the Trueth / by what meanes the Esa 59 b.4. Esd. 6 c 14.b. Trueth of God hath remayned so vnknowen and in secret among the Children of Men the vpright Math. 24. Loue, grow∣en so colde, among many the true Gighteous∣nes / so vtterly forsaken and the Vnitee of Peace or all Concord and Loue / bin so rent, broken, or deuided: and by what Middlewall it cometh-to-pas / that all the Worlde is so full of Falshod: and that also therthrough / all Hipocrisye, Oze 4 a Rom. 1 c. Lyes, and Deceit / and all Slaundering, Enuye, Tray∣torye, and subtill Falshood, with al-maner of Vnrighteousnes, is com-in 4. Es 14.b Mat. 24.b. and beareth-swaye ouer the whole Worlde. 15. By meanes wherof likewyse / many good∣willing Heartes and Louers of the Trueth, are falne into great Greef-of mynde: and that cheef∣ly, because then do euidently see the Abhomyna∣cions and the Confused-estate, the Errours, and the Distruction of Men / and yet vnderstand not from whence the Corruptions are com / nor how they are to be amended / or how the Children of Men are to be ridd from them. The which Vn∣derstanding {reversed ;}to the Reformation of all Corrup∣tion; is taught and inherited, in the Commu∣nyaltie of the Loue of Iesu Christ, and in the mostholy Seruice of thesame. 16. And now, for to open, out of the mostholy
Seruice of the Loue of Iesu Christ; the right Vn∣derstanding of thatt wherof is spoken / so haue wee brought-foorth and set-out this Mytered∣worke of the spirituall Vnderstanding {reversed ;}to a Ser∣uiceablenes, for the Louers of the Trueth, and for the Disciples of ye Loue / as also for all young Youth, that submytt them vnder the Loue and her Seruice / wherby to procure in them all; with thissame; a Delytfull-likeing towardes the true Beeing: and for that they shoulde all likewyse / recreate themselues one-with-another / in the Knowledg Ioh. 17.. Ephe. 1.c.4.b. of the godly Trueth: Also for to witnesse and bring-to-light euery wheare {reversed ;}in ma∣ner of a Playe; the Lyfe of the inwarde Kingdom of God (the which is a Iohn. 1.2. Light / that was pre∣pared from the Beginning, to be a Lyfe vnto the Man) or the Knowledg of thesame: As likewyse to discouer ther-through, the Mans Foolishnes, and his cleauing to the Danitee. And how that hee; through his owne good-thinking Wisdom; is captiued, and becometh yet dayly captiued with thesame. 17. BEsydes this, wee haue also, to a far∣der Recreating of the good-willing Heartes; ordayned in Myter, certen effectuall Refraynes and Rondels / as likewyse an A. B. C. / the tenn Commaundementes of God / ye Twelue Articls of the Christian-fayeth / with also certen good Lessons and Prayers: and haue likewyse set-foorth certen Canticles or Songes / to thend to drawe all young Youth somuch-the-more-willingly to the Obedience of the Requyring of the
Seruice of Loue / because that they all which loue the Trueth / mought stedfastly beleeue the holy and godly Vnderstanding / that floweth out of the Heart of Loue and Mercy / and mought; in the Knowledg of the Requyring of God; be illu∣minated with the Light of the louely Cleernes of thesame Vnderstanding: and also that all those (which; out of a good meaning; are yet in Er∣rour, and haue fastened or seduced themselues vp∣pon a strainge Foundation, with-out our Com∣munialtee of Loue) mought com to a Discerning or Knowledg of themselues turne them to God and his mercifull Esa. 55.a Ezec. 18.d Ioel. 2.b.

For the Coming of the Luk. 17.c Kingdom of God, cometh not to pas with outward Apparance / as that men may saye: Lo, heere Math. 24. or theare it is. For beholde: The Kingdom of God and the Lyfe of the heauenly Beeing, is inwardly Luk. 17. with in Vs. Those which haue Mat. 13. Luk. 8.a.

PAVSA I. The Second Chapter. Iohe. SWeetnes Eccl. 24.b and Ione, is my Exercise always: Which God {reversed ;}in my Motions; worteth, to his Peayse. Godly sweete Plasures / .c.  21 a. are my Conditions likewyse. Wheare I am, men are ioyfull, in All they exercyse / Ther 21.c.  b. is in Gods Ringdom, no euell Act, nor lamenting. I liue ioyfully with God, ohn. 8.d in his Daye, to my Contenting. To the Belfare of Playne-and-iust, I do my best indeuer. Loue. 2. In the exercising of loue, my Ioyes do still perseuer / Which God worketh {reversed ;}in Mee; without Lediousnes or Payne. I loue, am Mat. 11.d. 1 Cor. 13.a. long suffering / as men may see ful-playne: Also freendly, in all my Beeing, Nature, and Rynde. Through Mee, the liueing God, is declared, ye do fynde: For God, 1. Ih. 4.a to the loue, compared is ful-right. I loue, haue neuer, reiected any Wight. I wil-not deceaue, 1 Cor. 13.a nor enuy Any-man: And to exalt myself, I neuer did nor can. I am pacient in Suffering / for God is my Stabilitee. All this {reversed ;}to Playne-and-iust; doth chance for his Comoditee. 3. I am likewyse {reversed ;}in my Mynde; both peaceable and mylde. All this is Gods owne Worke: for Hee the same doth bylde. Wheare I dwell, Ioh. 14.c. 1. Ioh. 4.. Apo. 21.a. is Gods Howse / and theare {reversed ;}in vpright vce; God is most truly serued, without any Abuce: For God hath {reversed ;}in his Ringdom; Mee therto orbayned / That I should {reversed ;}Playne-and-iust; reioyce with Ioye vnfayned. Reasonablenes. 4. I Reasonablnes / am vpright in Nature. Which God doth work in Mee, that am his own Figure: Because I shoulde vse Measure / in all I tate-in-hande. For in all my Walkings, reasonable I stande: In all my Meate and Drink, I am reasonable too. Reasonable, in all my Worts, that I diuise and doo.
Measure is {reversed ;}in eury Thing; my Teaching and Forth-bringing. I laude my God alwayes / Col. 3.b. Ieam. 5.. with Playing and with Singing. For I am the true Compas / and the right Path also: Wherby it may alwayes / with Playne-and-iust / wel go. Obedience. 5. To be obedient vnto God / thatt is my Manifestacion: Which God doth wort in Mee / to his Prayse and Gloryfycation. I seete not also / Ioh. 5.. myne owne Honour to procure: But I am obedient / vnto Gods Doctrine pure. I neuer shrinte from Hym / through any bad Intencion. I seete neither Suttletee, nor any New-inuencion. I cannot any-way / Gods holy lawe transgresse. Therfore liues Playne and-iust / with Mee in Quyetnesse. Trueth. 6. I Trueth, am High-priest / in Gods Ringdom, alway / In Mee, theternall lyfe / is firme / without decaye. That doth my true Father / wort in Mee aright. For in his mighty Kingdom / I am Iohn. 1.a. 8.b the perfect light: Also my Fathers Ioh. 14.a Waye, like as tis written ryfe: The right Ioh 15.a. Byne-stoct, and the eternall lyfe. For without the Trueth / God cannot pleased bee. Therfore the High-priests-office, Hebr 5 6. 7 8. hath Hee resignd to Mee. 7. I am the Tree Gen. 2 a. Pro. b Ier. 7.b. Apo. .a. of lyfe / out of loue bloweing. If Playne-and-iust do still, in Mee; remayne growing, Then with him at all tymes / shall-it go right-well. All en. 7.c Rations shall serue him / that vnder Heauen do dwell: For him hath God loued, and likewyse elected: But if he fall from Mee / he is lost and quyt reiected: For I am the Ela 28.d. 1. Cor. 3.b Ephe 2.d.1. Pet. .a. Foundation, the right Grounde-stone. Ther is not any other / but I myself alone, Wheron all Vnderstanding / must euermore be grounded. Although ther be many Testimonyes / florishingly forth-sounded / Yet do I counsaile Playne-and-iust, with Mee to tary still. Which if he doo / noman then / can him destroye or till. Knewledg. 8. I Knowledg, to beholde / am pleasant and delcetable. God worteth through Mee / his Prophecie vnfaylable. Through Mee / God reucaleth his high holy Name.
I am very meete / to set-foorth his Honour and Fame: For who can in Knowledg / Sap. 8. Rom. 41.d 1. Cor. .b God erceede or-yet com-ny? Whose vseth Mee, must needes eralt Pro. 6.b. Sap. 7.8. Eccl. 24.b himself on-hy. Therfore also hath God {reversed ;}with Mee {reversed ;}his Wort alone. For with the mighty Knowledg, He excelleth eueryone, In Knowledg, is Hee / extolled aboue All. In Knowledg, can noman / with God becom equall. In Knowledg of the Trueth, his Wort it is miraculous: But without Knowledg of ye Trueth, I wort ye Death pernitious. Whosoeuer toucheth Me / my Bewty for to inberit / Hee must {reversed ;}through my Fruits; bye Cen. 2.3. from the lyfe in Spirit. 9. Therfore must Playne-and-iust / from mee auoyde and fly. If he tate-on my Fruit, into Wo he come therby: For I am only / for Gods owne Speculacion. Whoso tyes himself to Mee, come into Tribulacion: And is from all Ioye, very farr excluded. But God can want nothing, nor-net be deluded: For the lyfe of the Trueth, in Him is firmly sett: Therfore do all those, much Beracion gett / Which {reversed ;}without the Trueths lyfe; Mee do touch or handle. Searcher. 10. I Searcher, am very hardy / and do not feare not tremble / And subtiller / then all Gen. 3.a. created Beasts / am I / God doth both Heart and Reynes {reversed ;}through Mee; Psal. .. Ier. 7.b. Apo. .f. searth-out and cry: For I {reversed ;}with nimble Powers; do search both biah and lowe. God doth the Mans Thoughts {reversed ;}by Mee; fynde-out and knowe. I am searthing, in subtle Fore-cast or wyly Inuencion. Therfore do they all lifewyse / growe into great Contencion, ☞Which (without Knowledg of ye Trueth) do fondly Mee beleeue. But so long as Mayne-and-iust / no eare to Mee doth geeue / And that his Thoughts / to ye Searching, do not bende their lust / Then it shall at al-tymes / go-well with Playne-and-iust. Playne-and-iust. 11. I Playne-and-iust / liue quyetly / in my Dearet. Playne-and-iust, hath God lmighty / created Mee. My Customable-dealing / is for to Plant Gen. 1 c. 2 Eccl. 17.a and Till. In God man I tryumph, in ioyful-moner still / Torch my Thougts: which are to helpe me {reversed ;}in my Power alwaye.
For {reversed ;}out of Mee; God hath them brought / to be my helpe and Staye. Therfore also am I to her {reversed ;}with my gentil loue; inclyned: For God hath Cen. 2. gott her out of Mee, and her to me assyned: To the intent that wee {reversed ;}as his louely Company; Thoulde teepe his godly Esa. 60.61 Iohn. 15.a Plantings, that they mought growe and multiply. Cogitacions. 12. I Cogitacions {reversed ;}in Gods Kingdom; am doutles very Meete. I do not fayle or decaye / in Ioyful-solace sweete. Playne-and-iust is appoynted / the Headd Gen. 3.b. 1. Cor. 14.d of my Dealing. With Playne-and-iust therfore / is my Course-of-walting. For God hath ioyned me to him / together for to dwell. And Playne-and iust likewyse, contenteth mee right well. We teepe ourselues together, as one-anothers Mate. What God doth Mat. 19.a. Mar. 10. ioyne together, shall noman seperate. 13. Thus liue we heere at libertee / in Peace exceeding greate. But of the Tree of Knowledg / we may in no wyse Gen. 2.b. eate: Because that wee in al things / may haue good Succession. The Third Chapter. Searcher. UNoble Cogitacions, think thou on no Sup∣pression. But Search thou after Knowledg, and confider of it duly: For Through Knowledg / shall he be like Gen. 3.a. God in Knowledg / truly. Hadst thou once Knowledg / God were not then aboue thee. And if thou byde simple / Who shall commende or loue thee? But if thou haue Knowledg {reversed ;}life God of worthy prayse; Of Good and Euell / then mayst thou / compare with Him al∣wayes▪ Therfore lay holde of the Fruit / to thy Conunodyous gayne / And so {reversed ;}both Good and Euell; learne thou to know more playne.

Because I feare it woulde / Gods Cursse vppon vs bring For althings great and small / we Gen. 3.a. vse them eury one / Saue the goigious Knowledg / excepted heere alone: For God Gen. 2.b. hath forbodd vs / to touch thesame Tree.

But the Knowledg may we not / open or vnbynde. With thatt we must not deale / God hath forbodd it specially. But all the other Fruits / are to our Comodity.

From God and from his loue / to receaue our Nonshment: As also Gods Honour (and not our selues) to seete. Searcher. 8. Yea, wil ye bewrapp yourselues in such Obedience meete? That is Gods 1. Reg. 15. Pleasure / and his Will indeede: But so can ye neuer / to the Knowledg proceede. For whoso the Commandement / doth not search and stann / He remayneth alwayes / a simple foolish Man: And to be leadd heere and theare / is very-well-content. Not once knowing rightly (thissame is euident) Whither thatt which is tolde him / be either good or yll. But through Knowledg one becows {reversed ;}like God; Gen. 3.a. full of Still.

But if thou byde simple / then comst thou into shame: Wheare is then thyne Honour? haue that in thy Rememberance. Cogitacions. 11. That is very-true: Who then mought work vs Hinderance? For Knowledg doth reueale / perfect Doctrine vnto Men: When I knowe Good and Enell / who may be my lorde then? Are wee not then like Gen. 3. God / by obtayning this our lust? Searchr. 12.

Oh / Ignorance! how canst thou ouer the Man thus raigne / That he can nothing-els, vnderstand, learne, nor gayne / But thatt wherto Good-thinking, Deu. 12.29 doth dayly him direct. Gelf-will, doth likewyse, increase in him amayne. He reioyceth in Self-myndednes, and wil it not reiect. Enuyousnes and Crueltee, he doth prayse and much respect. To persecute Gen. 4. innocent Blood, hee is also rey and gladd. He is soone mooued-to-fury, and grinneth {reversed ;}in effect; At Another, life a Dogg, thats fierce and raging-madd. Oh!

Oh / what a number of Greefes, hath he suctt / to his decaye! lineing after his Pleasure / in Good-thinkings vayne Race:

O eternall Prince, God almighty Father-on-hy!

Oh! that the Man mought now, turne to his God agayne / Thatsame shoulde him iustify / from Sinne that so doth raigne: Walking playne and iust / worthy of Commending: The Ende of the Re∣frine. So mought he then liue, without all Feare or Payne. Oh! when shall the Man, becom Vnderstanding? 5.
