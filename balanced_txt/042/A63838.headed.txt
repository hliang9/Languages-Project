A Character of CHARLES the Second. IF the Naturalists pretend to give a reason why the Son of Croesus, who had been dumb from his Infancy, seeing a Souldier ready to kill his Father, cryed out, I is the KING! The force of Natural affection breaking those strings, which, un∣til that moment, had tyed his tongue: Who will wonder that a man, who on the busie Theater of his Countrey, hath hitherto presented the Person of a Mute, should violate his resolutions of continuing silent, when he sees the cursing Shi∣mei's of this depraved Nation, going to murther the good fame of his Master, his Soveraign, and the common Father of the People? Therefore since my zeal to Truth, my veneration for Gods Anointed, and my tendernesse for my Countrey hath loosen'd my Tongue, I have taken the boldnesse to informe the deluded People what manner of Man he is, a∣gainst whom these Serpents have spit their Venome. And who may pretend to be better heard, or more believed, then a Person who hath past eighteen Years of his Time, in the Service and Court of this Illustrious PRINCE? And who dares challenge the World to finde in the whole processe of his Life, one instance of the least deflexion from the severest rules of sincerity; which yet he does not vainly urge to enhaunse his Reputation, but to strengthen his evidence, humbly acknowledging, that he does not owe this steddinesse to the complexion of his spirit, but to the goodnesse of Almighty God, who resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. But before I begin to trace the first Lines of this Piece, I conceive it very necessary to discover those Incidents, which have conspired to abuse the Judgements of many disinteressed, well-meaning Persons, who were otherwise sufficiently fortified against the practises of notorious Enemies. So great have been the distresses of his MAJESTY, since he hath been exil'd from His Kingdomes, that he could not possibly support those many Retainers to His Court and Cause, which have been in∣volv'd in the common Fate of his Party; and it is so natural for all men to overvalue their own me∣rits, that they think themselves very much injur'd, if they are not admitted to equal shares with the rest of their fellow Servants, though far more eminent for their services past, and better fitted for present employments; so that neither his MAJESTIES insuperable necessities, nor the disparity of their deserts, could hinder these presumptuous Persons, from murmuring at his Ministers, whilst they were abroad, and blasting of his personal vertues when they returned home, and many of these unworthy men ha∣ving been honour'd either with some Domestick relation to his MAJESTY, or at least, with free accesse to his Court, had such pretences to be credited in all their reports, that whilst the KING was not known to the People, who are ever inclin'd to believe the worst, they easily perverted the can∣dour of their opinions, either by wounding the Judgement of His MAJESTY in the choice of his Ministers, or profaning His Character by most impudent slanders, especially, during the Tyranny of the late Protector, and the vile Instruments of his ambition, who having murthered the Father, and seized the Inheritance of the Son, knew that there were no better means to preserve their Possessions, then by recriminating the Person of the Lawful Pretender; and therefore they were so prodigal of
their rewards to these Apostates, that in the vast Profusion of the publick Treasure of the Kingdom, the at unhappy etch Man∣ng (when he as a Prisoner  Colen) con∣ed that his lary from the otector was 00.L a Month. Salaries of these Villains will be found one of the most costly Items. 'Tis true, the Persons and Pra∣ctises of many of these gracelesse men were a long time since very particularly known, but such hath been the iniquity of the Times, that men might perpetrate the blackest Crimes with more security, then impeach a Criminal: and who then could expect that there should be found any Martyrs for the Truth, when it was become a Principle in their Religion to abet the present Power, which is, To lye for their Interest. So that at my return into England, after Eleven years absence, truly I was astonished to finde that this Poyson was not more diffused, considering the activity of the Deceivers, and the Sla∣vish remisseness of those who should have generously opposed them. But it hath pleased Almighty God marvelously to preserve his Majesties good Name, against the malice of those wicked men, who went about to slander the foot-steps of his Anointed. And now finding a dawning of Liberty to assert the Truth, I am bold to expose his Picture to the publick view, whose Person will hereafter (when his Luster shall break through the Clouds of his mis∣fortunes) prove the Delight of our Eyes. Though Plato hath made the Soul to be the Desinition of man, allowing the Body to be only the Car∣riage of the Spirit, yet since we receive our Information of Corporeal Subjects, as well from our Sense as our Understanding, I think it very proper to describe his Majestics Person as well as his Qualities. He is somewhat Taller then the middle stature of English men; so exactly form'd, that the most cu∣rious Eye cannot finde one Error in his shape. His Face is rather Grave then Severe, which is very much softned whensoever he speaks: His Complexion is somewhat dark, but much enlightned by his Eyes, which are Quick and Sparkling. Until he was near twenty years of Age, the figure of his Face was very Lovely; but he is since grown Leaner, and now the Majesty of his Countenance supplies the Lines of Beauty. His Haire, which he hath in great plenty, is of a shining Black, not frizled, but so Naturally Curling into great Rings, that it is a very comely Ornament. His Motions are so easie and graceful, that they do very much recommend his Person when he either Walks, Dances, playes at Pal Maille, at Tennis, or rides the great Horse, which are his usual Exercises. In summe, his Meene does denote his Quality; and wheresoever he appears, he easily obtains the respect and af∣fections of all that approach him; To the gracefulness of his deportment, may be joyn'd his easiness of access, his Patience in Attention, and the Gentlenesse both in the tone and style of his speech; so that those, whom either the veneration for his dignity, or the Majesty of his presence have put into an awful respect, are re-assur'd assoon as he enters into conversation; and this I have often heard observ'd by many persons of quality of several Nations, especially by the French, who are naturally more serene and jovial, then the People of these Northern Countreys, who at first approach'd him with some con∣straint, until his MAJESTY was better known to them; but to deal ingenuously, these advanta∣ges were not borne with him, for he was too reserv'd in his youth, but he owes these (with many other excellencies) to his misfortunes, which forcing him to communicate himself to all sorts of people of the several Nations where he hath sojourn'd, have cultivated his manners, and render'd his perfections habitual. Amongst his acquired endowments, these are the most eminent, He understands Spanish, and Italian; speaks and writes French correctly; He is well vers'd in ancient and modern History, hath read divers of the choicest Pieces of the Politicks, hath studyed some useful parts of the Mathematicks, as Fortification, and the knowledge of the Globe; but his chief delight is in Navigation, to which his Genius doth so incline him, that by his frequent conversation with Mariners, and his own observation, whilest he rid six weeks in the Downes, and in his passage into Scotland, he hath arrived to so much knowledge in this Science, that I have heard many expert Seamen (whose discourses are not steer'd by the compass of the Court) speak of it with delight and wonder; in general, He is a true friend to Literature, and to Learned Men. But I conceive my self oblig'd to be more particular in my discourse upon his Natural qualities, because they import the well or ill-being of all those who are under his Dominion; for though his out∣ward accomplishments may sufficiently recommend him to disinteressed strangers; yet they are onely
his genuine Vertues, which can render him agreeable to his own Subjects; amongst which I will as∣signe the first place to his Understanding, since without this, the rest of his vertues will have little signification towards the happiness of his People; for if he wanted that, it were more to the purpose to describe his Ministers then his MAJESTY; and 'tis they would have the dominion over the People, whilest he represented only the sign of a King: But I date assure the Nation that this will not be our case, for his MAJESTY hath not only a solid judgement, which (if the method of this discourse would permit) I could evince by many pregnant instances, as well as by the universal concession of all the Judicious men that know him. but He is so well, yet so modestly perswaded of it, that he dares trust himself, and is not capable of being carryed about with every Winde of Counsel; so that it will prove to be as truly said of his MAJESTY, as of his Grand-father, Henry the fourth, He that would corrupt his Council, must first begin with the King: And when his subjects shall consider the ad∣vantages of his Education, the different Nations and Factions that he hath had to deal with, the di∣rect opposition of his Enemies, and the treachery of his seeming Friends, the necessry of his trea∣ting with several Parties in Person, (because they would not trust those who were about him) the Va∣riety and Force of his Experience, from the distinct knowledge of the Natures of the People of several Countreys, of their chief Ministers of State, with the Intrigues of Government, both in their Chirches and Common-wealths, which other Princes have not had the opportunity, or misfortune to discover, and all these Lessons deriv'd from their natural Springs, and learn'd in that excellent School of Ad∣versity, which opens the Understanding, and confirms the Judgement; when these particulars are well considered, I believe, I shall not be put upon my Oath to prove this Article. Though the Sagacity of his Spirit may be of great advantage to himself or Friends, yet it will have no comfortable influence upon his Subjects in general, unlesse it be also accompanied with Justice, and therefore this is the vertue which is next to be considered. If Justice be well desin'd by the Moralists to be, The constant Will of giving to every man his due; then may I safely pronounce his Majesty to be a Just person. And though I have met with some reports which seem to impugne this Assertion, yet upon due examination of them, I am the more confirmed in this Character: For though the defection of some of the Royal Party hath given his Majesty general grounds of suspition, yet there is no man more averse then himself to entertain an ill opinion of any person, of whose honesty he hath had experience. But it hath been his fortune (as what Prince or private person can avoid it) to have had some absent persons of Merit & Integrity misrepresented to him by such subtile Arts, as humane wit could not at the present finde out the falshood. Some of these in∣nocent sufferers, either from the confidence of their own Sincerity, or, possibly, from their indiffer∣ency for his Majesties good Opinion (he not being in a condition either to reward or punish) have neglected their defence, and lain for some time under his Displeasure; but as soon as he once disco∣vered the Abuse (though without their applications) he hath not onely made them very Honourable reparations, but marked the Informers with a publick Character of Infamy: And of this particular I have so distinct a knowledge, that I do as confidently believe he is Just, as that he is a Man. These generous Qualities are actuated by the Magnanimity of his minde, expressed in his Fortitude and Courage, which I may best compare to one another; for his Majesty hath shewed as great Courage in his attempts, to recover his just rights, as Fortitude in his submission to Providence, in the decision of the Battle against him; and yet there have been some infectious breaths, who have endeavoured to blast his just Reputation; but he hath so signaliz'd his Courage wheresoever he appear'd, that even his inveterate Enemy - Cromwell himself, could not refuse him his just praises, though it was not his custome to give his Enemies their due honour, or to tell a truth, that might redound to his prejudice: But as this Character is not doubted by his Friends abroad, so I wish that it may never be known by experience to his enemies at home. But that they may not be alarm'd by this last Period; I do assure them, that Clemency is as na∣tural to his Majesty, as Courage: which is a Proposition that proves it self; for there is no Man truly valiant, that can be cruel; and it were to degrade himself, not to pardon injuries; for in taking Re∣venge, a man is but even with his Enemy: but in passing it over, he is become his Superiour. These
are general notions which I must apply to their particulars whom it may concern: His Majesties ge∣nuine Clemency is confirm'd by his veneration for his Fathers memory, who left him his commands to pardon his Enemies (even those Enemies who mingled their hands in his innocent blood) as his last Legacy; and I do know, that he is convinced, that it is his interest to forgive those that have op∣pos'd him, if they produce any seasonable Testimonies of their return and good intentions towards him; knowing that the despairs of his Enemies may produce cruel effects to his Friends: and he desires to make his access to his Throne as Innocent, and as certain as he can; and therefore as the common Father of his People, he endeavours that we should reconcile and embrace like Brethren; and concludes, That the best means to restore the crazie Body of the Kingdom to its former health and vigour, is not to cure one part, by afflicting of the other; but to heal those wounds which are already festred by their proper lenitives, and to remove (as much as lies in his power) all the causes of future Animosities; and this (to the best of my remembrance) is the substance of a discourse, which I have lately heard from his MAJESTIES own Mouth upon this Subject. But His MAJESTIES Natural Clemency may possibly want the desirable Effects to∣wards penitent Offenders, if he be not possest of a Religious fidelity of performing his Promise, and a Constancy of Resolution: If at least the ill advis'd Passion of the parties that have suf∣fered should ever incline them to importune him for their revenge, under the Stile of Justice; To this I reply, That Perfidiousnesse and Irresolution are so directly opposite to those Quali∣ties which I have already enumerated in his MAJESTIES CHARACTER, that they are altogether inconsistent; and if he should have the least inclination to Hypocrisie, that which I have hitherto said of him cannot be true; but he knows very well that the Reputation of Faithfulnesse is one of the chiefest Pillars of Regal Power; and that even his Friends may reasonably suspect the performance of his Promises to them, if he breaks his Faith to his Enemies. But to be more particular, I have often heard his MAJESTY declaime against the perfi∣dious practices, which he had observ'd in the Negotiations of some Publick Ministers a∣broad; and Men do not use to declare an open War against those Vices, to which themselves are obnoxious; and I could name some Persons whom he is pleas'd to honour with a particu∣lar esteeme, that have no other conspicuous Virtue besides their impregnable Honesty; for there is nothing in Nature more productive of friendship, then some resemblance in man∣ners: But the narrownesse of his Fortune not suffering him to supply some empty men, as profusely, as they had promis'd themselves; they have, branded His MAJESTY with Ingratitude, and Unfaithfulnesse, Sinnes which he abhors both from his Nature and Judge∣ment. A Man that is onely Innocent, and not actively Vertuous is so neare to imperfection and weakness, that it is hard to distinguish their confines; and if it be granted that His MAJESTY does possess these Illustrious Qualities, yet if he wants the Nature to produce them by Pra∣ctise, they may serve his Flatterers for Panegyricks, but they will be of little benefit to his Peo∣ple; therefore it is necessary to evince his Industry, to confirm the Character of an accomplish'd Prince. There was for a long time so dead a Calm in his businesse, his Enemies being so strong at home, and his Friends so engaged abroad, that he could not make one notorious, prudent step to∣wards his recovery, which his cautelous Enemies have represented to the undiscerning people under the reproach of Laziness. But the best of it is, he hath had an Army of his own Subjects for the Wit∣nesses as well of his Industry as Courage: And if these uningenuous censurers had been of his Train the last Year, when his Majesty rid Post above two hundred Leagues through France and part of Spain, in the heat of Summer, I perswade my self they would have confessed their own weariness, though possibly they had denied his Diligence: And he spares his Mind as little as his Body, for besides his conversation with Books, he consults and instructs all men that address to him
in his business; and amongst his Correspondents (which are not few) it may be there will scarce be found One to whom he owes a Letter. Amongst the Moral Vertues there are some which have not such glorious Names as these which I have already mentioned; but I think they are very considerable, because they are more diffus'd into the ordinary Actions of our lives. In this number I reckon Temperance in Speech, wherein his Majesty so excels, that I have often thought of it with admiration; for though I have sometimes seen him very justly angry, yet the hardest expression that I have ever heard him use to a Gentleman, was once, and but once, when he told one of his domesticks, That he was an Insolent fellow: And though the Authour of A late Letter from a neare Attendant on his Majesty, dated from Brussels, and written at London, may possibly be dis∣pleased with this contradiction, yet out of my respect to Truth, I am bold to affirm, That to the best of my remembrance, I never heard his Majesty swear an Oath in my life: But it is well known out of what Quiver these poysoned Arrowes come, which being shot against the impe∣netrable Buckler of his innocency, will rebound upon the faces of those wicked men that did first level them. To this may be joyn'd his Sobriety in Diet, in which he seldome makes the least excess, though he stands not in awe of his Constitution; for he is of so healthful a Temperament, that I have not known him above thrice sick these eighteens Years: But he so Naturally hates Debauchery, that his severity to this vice hath cured some habitual drunkards, who have chosen rather to part with their be∣loved sins, then with his Majesties Favour. Though I can neither impugne nor defend the constant austerity of his Majesties Life, since it is possible that in the heats of his Youth he may have rendred to the powerful charms of Beauty; yet I am certain that for many yeares he hath been so Chast and Cauti∣ous, that I have not heard the leaft whisper of any indecent Gallantry: And yet his impu∣dent Enemies have not only reproached him with habitual Incontinence, and farc'd their slanders with false and frivolous tales, knowing that Fame, like water, bears up light things and swallows the heavy; but they have suborned their Mercenary Prophets to denounce Gods Judgements against him, for these supposed Frailties, and to infer with as ill Morality as Lo∣gick, That his Majesty is unfit for Government, because that in his Youth he may not have been stronger then Samson, wiser then Solomon, or more holy then David. But whosoever will impartially consider his just Character, and compare him either with the Ancient or modern Princes of the World: will hardly finde a precedent where so many shining qualities are assem∣bled, or so little shadowed with any inclinations to vice: and if solid Vertue and Abilities for Government were a just title to Dominion, the British Ocean would not be the confines of his Empire. These Excellent Qualities are the products of a happy Nature, or a generous Education, but as the soul informs the body, so it is Religion which animates the Character of Christian Princes, and crowns their moral perfections, and therefore as the most eminent, I have reserv'd that to finish this Piece. For his interiour Piety, I leave it to the Searcher of thoughts, in whose hands are the hearts of Kings; for to us, the Tree is only known by the fruits; neither will I extend my self upon the dis∣course of his Humility, Meeknesse, Charity, and other divine Graces, since these produce the same effects (though more rais'd, because they are deriv'd from a higher Cause, for Christian Religion is onely Rea∣son sublim'd) which I have already treated under other names; and they are fitter for the Pens of those who have entrance into the Sanctuary, then for a secular Person; therefore I shall only insist upon His MAJESTIES Firmness to his Religion, as the most conducing to our purpose. And in this particular, he hath given such signal testimonies to the world, that I wonder at the folly, as well as the malice of his Enemies, that have planted their Batteries against this point; but
it is a Maxime deriv'd from the Father of Lyes, To calumniate boldly, that something may remain, and the People are so susceptible of tales, that it is hard to invent a Fable which is above their Faith. His MAJESTY having passed ten years of his exile in the territories of Catholick Princes, in France, Germany and Flanders, it cannot be doubted that he hath been frequently importuned to change his Religion, either by those, who out of a firm perswasion of the verity of their own belief, have thought it a charity to make him a Convert; or those who from the presumption of their great abilities in Controversie, have had the ambition to adde so illustrious a person to the number of their Proselytes, or those Politicians, who (despairing of his re-establishment, unlesse by the assistance of Catholick Princes) have urged his conversion to the Roman Faith, as the best means to take the benevolence of his Allyes: but they have all encountred such an immovable firmnesse in his MAJESTY to the Principles of his Religion, that they have retir'd from the assault with no other effects, then the satisfa∣ction of having discharged their Consciences, by their officious Counsels. Amongst many other Champions of the Roman Church; His MAJESTY was frequently attacqued (whilst he remained in France) by Monsieur de la Melitiere, a man of an excellent spirit, who had been formerly a Calvinist, and by Monsieur Salmonet, originally a Scotch-man, and favourite to the Cardinal de Retz, who have since printed and published the Arguments of their conference; and there is hardly any Roman Catholick of note for Piety or Learning in any part of the World, where his MAJE∣STY hath been, that hath not joyn'd his Forces to combate him for his Religion. And shall he that hath pass'd so succesfully through a ten years War in the defence of his Faith, be rob'd of his Triumph, and of his Highest Title, by the tongue or pen of a perjur'd Villain? We must then conclude, that Justice is fled to Heaven, and hath left us nothing here but her Ballance, in which these wretched men do weigh their worldly Interests, against all the moral and divine Vertues; but Truth will be justified of her Children, and His MAJESTIES perseverance in his Religion will be dear to the truly pious People of this Nation, when the faces of these slanderers shall grow black with confusion. But his MAJESTIES Fervour for his own way of Worship does not invade his Charity to dissenting Christians: He is convinced by his Experience, as well as by his Reason, That Consciences are not to be forc'd, and that men may reasonably suspect the truth of that Religion, which useth the Sword for her Argument; since it is as much against Reason as Charity, to persecute those who may be in the right, or if not, shall by this means be kept longer in the wrong; And therefore those tender Consciences, who worship God in the sincerity of their spirits, and do not diffent from their Brethren, to advance their humane Interests, ought to joyn in their Prayers to Almighty God, with the rest of the People, o place this Religious, Virtuous King in Peace, upon the Throne of his Ancestors. And if the Illustrious Birth of His Sacred MAJESTY, His Just Title to dominion over us; war∣ranted by the Laws of these Kingdoms, and marvelously asserted by the Providence of God; and who (besides his Acquir'd Perfections) is possest of Wisdome, Justice, Fortitude, Courage, Clemency, Faith∣fulness, Industry, Temperance, and Steddinesse in his Religion; If these Eminent Qualities may derive hap∣pinesse to His People, Then it is in our power to be happy, and He is bold to pronounce this to his Fellow-Subjects; Who is so far from betraying his Countrey for his Prince, that he would not betray a Private Person, either for his Prince or Countrey. FINIS.
