SOME NOTES Concerning the LIFE OF EDWARD LORD NORTH, BARON of KIRTLING, 1658. Inter bonos non obsolescit beneficiorum memoria. By Sir DƲDLEY NORTH Lord NORTH.
TO MY Eldest Son. SINCE it hath pleased God to set you in a condition, whereby you are likely to be entrusted, with the honour of your House, and of all which is most precious be∣longing to it, I have judged you the person to whom I might most fitly re∣commend the ensuing discourse, being an Historical Narration of the Life and Actings of the Raiser of your Fa∣mily. Whatsoever you may find this small Work to be in it self, yet I know you will be carefull to preserve it in being, in respect of its relation
to the person who is the Subject of it, and to whom we owe our eminency, if any we have. I doubt not but your own curiosity will exact at your hands the reading of it, and the fault will not be great if you doe it more than once; for besides that which relateth to your Family, you shall there find some things concerning the History of those times, which are not easie to be met with elsewhere; but the best use that you can make of your reading is this, the taking of your Ancestour as a precedent to direct the course of your life hereafter, which custome was usual with the old Romans, and very much stirred up their Patricii or young Nobles in the way of Vertue. You are now in the prime of your age (as to the active part of it,) and having the advantage of so much time before you, it may please God to give you much more liberty to dispose of your self and of your courses, than I have had. Doe then as this Pro∣genitor of yours did, First gain abilities
by study and observation in your youth, and afterwards employ those abilities in the service of God and your Country. As for your own person and private for∣tunes, it will be imprudence not to seek their preservation, and you may be in∣structed by this good Example, to endea∣vour the advancement of them, as far as it may be done without hindrance of a greater good; for such an ambition is so far from being unlawfull, as it gives wings (or rather being) to many designs tending to publick benefit. For me, it will be my part to assist you by my pray∣ers, and otherwise according to my abi∣lity; and for such assistances, you shall be sure to receive them at the hands of Your most truly affectionate Father.
SOME NOTES Concerning the LIFE OF EDWARD LORD NORTH, BARON of KIRTLING. SUCH was the piety of the ancient hea∣then Romans towards their deceased Pa∣rents, as it became usual to sacrifice to the Gods for them: Nay at last it grew to that height, as many of the Roman Emperours thought not their duty sufficiently performed, unless they ranked their Parents in the num∣ber of their Gods, and so turned that which formerly had been received as commendable, into a very high Impiety. Among the ancient Christians (and very near the times of pri∣mitive Purity) the former was so far revived, as it became a note of Piety to pray for their parents departed; and the custom was so ge∣nerally applauded, as it grew to extend it
self to Benefactours as well as to Parents; and in this the Clergy men, as being conceived to pray more effectually than others, found so great an advantage, as they have thought fit to give it continuance even unto this day in the Romish Church. But the use of Prayer in that kind is now justly exploded by our reformed Divines as an errour, and I shall leave the con∣futation of it to them, as a thing most pro∣per to their profession; yet thus much may be delivered as a certainty, that a reverend affection to Parents and Benefactours, which was the ground of that custom, is not only lawfull but praiseworthy: And so natural it is to me, as where I conceive my self to have received a great benefit from one who hath finished his course in this life, it constantly possesseth my thoughts, that something is to be done by way of gratitude towards him. And thus it was with me in relation to Ed∣ward Lord North, the common Parent and raiser of our Family, till my perusal of the old and almost worn-out Papers remaining at Kirtling, gave me a ground-work to leave something behind me, which might preserve the memory of a person of so much Vertue and Eminency. Yet some things have occurred to my thoughts by way of discouragement, to divert me from such a purpose. As first this, That since he was Propriae Fortunae Fa∣ber, and raised himself upon a small basis, wanting the advantage of a high and noble
extraction, it would become a derogation to us of his Posterity to mention his beginnings. In this I quickly satisfied my self, for my in∣tention relateth only to a person whose asser∣tion was, That they were only truly noble whose own Vertue rendred them so; and these memorials are not designed for publick use, but only to remain with us his Progeny, who from the consideration of his advance∣ment may take occasion to praise God the more highly, for the great industry and pro∣sperity of our Ancestor. And yet we may justly affirm thus much concerning his Des∣cent, that he derived it from a family of ancient Gentry, though perhaps not so remarkable for greatness of Estate as many others; nor shall we blush to hear that even that moderate lustre of his was somewhat abated by his Father's ap∣plication of himself to become a Citizen of London, for that course of life in our later times, is grown usual in very considerable families with younger Brothers (in which rank his Father was) in so much as many of them by that means have so outstript the chief branch of their house, as now to be en∣rowled with the greater Nobility, and to wear Coronets. Another disswasive was this, That as we have no light at all in that which he did during his youth, so not in very many particulars after the time of his activity. The former part of this argument must not pre∣vail with any man, who hath but so much
Christianity as to esteem the Evangelical Hi∣story, and the latter part being but a proof of his modesty, rendring it probable he concei∣ved it a degree of vanity to leave any record of his actions in writing, whereby he might have seemed to covet fame with after Ages, it became rather an incentive than a weak∣ning to me in my desire to continue the re∣membrance of that which either appeareth, or may be recovered concerning him; and I doubt not but I shall deliver that which is suf∣ficient to satisfie any indifferent Reader, con∣cerning the great worth of the person whose Character I undertake. To make therefore an entry upon the Re∣lation, Edward Lord North was the Son (and for ought we know, the only Son) of Roger North, and of Christian Warcop his Wife▪ des∣cended of a good Family of Gentry in York∣shire, of that name; and he was born about the year of our Lord 1496, as near as we can conjecture, and during the reign of King Henry the 7th. This Roger was of the Family of the Norths of Walkeringam in the County of Nottingham, which Norths had preserved a small Fortune in that County and place for many Generations, without any considerable encrease or diminution, living always in the quality of private Gentlemen, untill the days of the said Edward Lord North; and many years after, till the chief of that Race, by a Shreivalty cast upon him, with many charge∣able
suits in Law, and by the prodigality of his eldest Son, who unhappily had taken upon him the honour of Knighthood, was enforced to part with so much Land, as it caused his Heirs to fall out with the Mansion house, and sell it to the Perpoints, who at this time are ow∣ners of it. The affection of Edward Lord North to his Kindred of Walkeringam, was always very great, and so was his care of them in their prime concernments, and espe∣cially of Edward North their Chief in that age; for in settling the greatest part of his estate by way of Entail, he preferred this Edward and his Posterity, before the House of Worcester, and all other Descendents of his own Daugh∣ters, whose Issue was sufficiently numerous. This Roger, as hath been intimated, being a Citizen of London, never attained to any eminency of Estate, yet was he not so straitned in his fortune, but that he could and did afford to his Son a costly way of breeding, training him up at the Inns of Court in the study of the Law. Like a good and wise Parent, discern∣ing in his Child a capacity too large to exer∣cise it self in his own narrow course of Mer∣cery, he found out for him (though not with∣out some inconvenience to himself) a way of greater extent and activity, which it pleased God very highly to bless, as shall appear in the sequel of this narration. From the little that is known of what he did in the prime of his years, we may conclude, and not unfitly, that being
of an industrious nature he spent his time at first about the laying of a foundation in the way of his profession by Study, and that af∣terwards having gained abilities, he sought to render himself and his parts known, by ap∣plying himself to a fair and moderate practice of the Law in a plausible way; in which he made so fair a progress, as it appears, that he came to be of Council for the City of London, and had a yearly Fee for that service, though it be not known at what time of his age he came to be so. The first publick employment of his that we have evidence for, is this, his having the Clerkship of Parliament by grant from King Henry the 8th. in the year 1530, which it seems in those days was an office of much more respect than now it is, for he had it first by Patent jointly with Sir Bryan Tuke, and then wholly to himself, and it was afterwards enjoyed by Sir William Pagett, then Secretary of State, and so it came to Sir John Mason, and others: But had the place been of meaner condition, he had wisedom sufficient to in∣struct him, that it is better for those who have their fortunes to make, to play at small game, than to sit out. About this time, as by all other fair ways, so in that of Marriage he sought his advancement, and espoused himself to his first Wife, who being a Widow and having had two Husbands, brought him such an increase, as not long after, he purchased
his Manor of Kirtling. This was about the 33d. year of his age, which sheweth that he was not hasty in parting with his liberty, for he well knew the want of that to be one of the chief remoras to young men, as to their applications in the way of preferment other∣wise, and therefore when he came to sell him∣self, he suffered not his affections to over-rule his judgment, but made such a choice, as to be sure in some measure, that the advantages of his Wifes estate should not be overballanced by any natural indispositions or ill dispositions adhering to, or inherent in her person. And not many years after this, his Sun began to ascend very fast towards its Zenith, for the King having taken a resolution to shake off the Papal yoke, he drew to his service from all parts, the most able and active spirits, and among others this worthy person, so as in the year 1536, he became one of the King's Ser∣geants at Law, for so we find him styled by the King himself in a grant then made to him. And now the dissolution of Monasteries being enacted by Parliament, and the Court of Aug∣mentations being erected for the ordering of that new accession to the Crown, it pleased the King about the year 1540, to confer upon him the office of Treasurership of that Court, which he enjoyed about four years, and during that time, in the year 1542, by the name of Sir Edward North (for he had received the ho∣nour of Knighthood) he was High Sheriff of
the Counties of Cambridge and Huntingdon, and also elected to serve in Parliament as Knight of the Shire for Cambridge-shire, which two employments did rarely concur in one and the same person. And afterwards in the year 1544, he first became Chancellour of the Augmenta∣tions joyntly with Sir Richard Rich, after∣wards Lord Rich, and Chancellour of England; and within a few months following, sole Chan∣cellour of that Court, by resignation of the said Sir Richard Rich unto him, and so he enjoy∣ed that great office alone about four years; in which time (as we suppose) he might well have raised his fortunes double to the propor∣tion he left to his Family, if he had not been a person of very great integrity. But though his particular actions in the managing of that great trust were sincere, and so not much ob∣noxious to detraction, yet his acting in an affair so highly offensive to the Roman Catholick party, exposed him to the censure of some of his own posterity of that profession; for upon some declinations in the house which he had raised, they have not forborn to impute the diminutions to that only cause, as a crime that had been the destruction of many Families so raised, and would be the Catastrophe of his. I conceive this to savour too much of teme∣rity, if it be not injurious, but I intend not to undertake the vindication of this and other States, in their power of setting out at the first (or giving continuance to) a fit propor∣tion
for the maintenance of those, either single persons or Fraternities, which are set apart for external service in the way of Religion, which power was not a thing altogether new in those times, as may appear by the Statute of Mort∣mayne, whereby dedications in the way of Piety were much prevented; and why may not a State finding the excess very prejudicial to the whole Nation (who may challenge a higher charity than any part whatsoever) as well anihilate such gifts already made as pre∣vent them? for Dedication seemeth to consist rather in the declared intention of the giver, than in the approbation of Governours, either Ecclesiastical or Temporal. Neither shall I define how little subjects are blamable for exe∣cuting the decrees of their supreme Magistra∣cy, though unjust or seeming irreligious, al∣beit it were an obstruction scarcely recovera∣ble in a State, if subordinate Ministers should be obliged to dispute the rectitude or obliquity of every decree. But certainly it can be no other than a high presumption, to apply the judgments of the Almighty with too much strictness to such and such a particular cause, for as the judgments are evident and exposed to the view of all, so their grounds lie con∣cealed in the clouds and darkness which are said to encompass the Deity; and many times those who are crushed under a punishment, do no more exceed their fellows in guiltiness, than they in the Gospel on whom the Tower of Siloah fell.
But to leave this digression, Sir Edward North now stood so high in the favour of his Prince, as he put him into the roll of Privy-Counsel∣lours, and made frequent grants of Land as a testimony of his favour, and of the good ac∣ceptance of the services done by him. These were great encouragements, and could not but carry with them as great a satisfaction to the receiver, but it was so usual with this King to throw down those whom he had raised, as it made his great ones Stare sempre in cervello, (as the Italians term it) or to be watchfull, car∣rying still in their minds the instability of the ground whereon they stood. And to give some tast how dangerous a Master he served, and how apprehensive he was of a change in the way of displeasure, I shall here insert a rela∣tion which came to me, though not immedi∣ately, from one who being himself an Atten∣dant in his Bed-chamber, then when the mat∣ter passed, was an eye and ear Witness of it, and this it is. That once early in the morn∣ing there came from the King to Charterhouse, then the Mansion house of Sir Edward North, a Messenger known to be no friend of his, to command his immediate repair to Court, which message was also delivered with some harsh∣ness. This was so terrible in the suddainness and other circumstances, as he observed his Master to tremble at the delivery of it, who yet finding it dangerous to use the least delay, hasted thither, and was admitted speedily to
the King's presence with this his Servant attend∣ing on him. The King was then walking, and continued doing so with great earnestness, and ever now and then cast an angry eye upon him, which was received with a very still and sober carriage. At last the King brake out into these words, We are informed that you have cheated us of certain Lands in Middlesex, whereunto having received no other than a plain and humble negation, after some little space he replyed, How was it then, did We give those Lands to you? whereunto Sir Ed∣ward answered, yes, Sir, Your Majesty was pleased so to doe. Whereupon having paused a little, the King put on a milder countenance, and called him to a Cupboard, conferring pri∣vately with him a long time; whereby, said this Servant, I saw that the King could not spare my Master's service as yet; but whether or no the cause lay in the King's occasions, or in the other's humble behaviour and answers, it must be left to judgment, for as Solomon saith, A soft answer turneth away wrath. But to pursue the Series of our discourse, King Henry after a long and strange prospe∣rity in all his undertakings, which were ex∣traordinary and full of hazard, came to breath his last in the year of Grace 1546, and as a full and final testimony of his confidence in the integrity of Sir Edward North, he consti∣tuted him one of his Executors, leaving unto divers others of his Council, persons of more
eminent condition, the title of Overseers of his Testament, a character of higher honour, but of lest trust. And seeing that this King was so great a benefactour to the person who is the occasion of this tractate, I shall adven∣ture to borrow so much time of the Reader, as to say thus much more of him. I know that many things are laid to his charge, as that he was burthensom to his Subjects and yet a wa∣ster, That he was Sanguinary and Voluptuous almost to the height. As I will not go about to absolve him concerning these, so I shall leave it to others who may conceive them∣selves more proper for it, to set him out in such colours, but thus much I shall take upon me to say on his behalf, That he was endued with very great and royal abilities, and that of all the governours of our Nation he is the only Prince meriting to be styled Arbiter of the most important affairs of Christendom, (or the Ballancer as Guicchiardin calls him) and this he did by assistance constantly, but variously given in the Wars between Charles the 5th. Emperour of Germany, and Francis the first of France, still supporting the weaker and opposing the stronger, by which means he kept those Princes still in play one against the other, and so established his own security, and in that respect was very fitly honoured with this Motto, Cui adhereo praeest. And I think that the bitterest of his enemies must give him this testimony, That he was no less boun∣tifull
in his Rewards, than severe in his Punish∣ments, that he maintained the honour of the Nation with Foreign Princes in point of pow∣er, and that he carried on the worst of his actions relating to the publick, with a con∣currence of his Parliaments, which howso∣ever his heart was disposed, yet sheweth a ve∣ry great dexterity of Brain. But that which leaveth him the greatest glory is this, That he laid the ground-work of a Reformation in the Church of England, which afterwards grew to that perfection, as justly to be deemed by judicious persons, the best tempered of any in the Christian World. And now upon his death the Scene is whol∣ly changed, for in stead of an active King, who for the most part governed his own af∣fairs, the Crown is fallen to a Prince, who by reason of his Nonage being not able to go∣vern himself, and much less two so potent Nations, falleth under the tuition of his Ser∣vants, whose nature is such, as they seldom fail to be guided by their own ambition ra∣ther than the improvement of their Master's interests. And this renders the providence of God the more conspicuous, for in this King's days the Reformation of the Church was ex∣alted almost to the height, and in a way of more Purity than before, for King Henry seemed rather to seek the abolition of Papal authority, which so far restrained his Regal power, than any other change in the Arti∣cles
of the then received Faith; but during the reign of King Edward, there was an aim at the establishment of Truth, even in such points of belief as had small relation to that competition for power. But to return to our business, the person whose Life we endeavour to describe, soon found a difference between his old Master King Henry, who already had gratified most of those which had shewed themselves active in his service, and the Duke of Somerset newly made Protector of the King's person; for this man, that he may advance to places of honour and power those persons who have their dependance upon him, must either find or force a way for the effecting of it, with them who are in possession of those dignities. And King Edward had not reigned two years, before Richard Sackvill Esq; had the Chancellourship of the Augmentations in his eye, and with all so great an interest in the Protector, as to engage him strongly in the pursuit. For the Protector soon caused the business to be proposed to the person whom it chiefly concerned, and he finding himself too weak to wrestle with a man that did little less than govern the whole Kingdom in those days, thought fit so far to give way, as to bring the matter to a treaty, wherein he carried himself so like his arts Master, (though the Protector in person was witness to most of it,) as he parted with the place upon terms very considerable for honour, security, and
profit; and yet ordered the business in such a manner, as the Protector could not but take himself to be obliged in it, as may appear by the articles of agreement between Sackvill and him, and by other writings under Seal belonging to that business, where the expres∣sions seem to lay all the weight upon the Lord Protector, who is therein styled Mr. Sackvill's good Lord. Thus by his wisedom, he not only prevented a mischief which might have befallen him in the opposition, and preserved himself in the dignity of a Privy Counsellor, but gained a fresh interest in the Duke of So∣merset, that might have made him great re∣turns; But it pleased God to dispose of matters otherwise, for the Protector soon lost not only his power but his life, being supplanted by the subtile practices of John afterwards Duke of Northumberland, who though he assumed not the other's title of Protector, yet bare no less sway in the government, and demeaned him∣self with much greater insolence than Somer∣set. About this time Sir Edward North, find∣ing way made upon him concerning his great office; thought good to strengthen himself by alliance, matching his eldest Son with the La∣dy Winifride Daughter to Richard Lord Rich, then Lord Chancellor of England, and Widow to Henry Dudley eldest Son to the said Duke of Northumberland; but neither that alliance, nor any of his other dependencies, gave him encouragement to seek farther advancement
during the reign of King Edward, so as then he endeavoured (as it seems) only to make good his former station, waiting for better opportunity. In the mean time, as appears by an account of his houshold expences, he shewed himself worthy of greater honour, by living in a way of more eminency than hath been usual with persons of his condition in those and the fol∣lowing times; and then also his wisedom prompted him to have an eye to the Princess Mary next in succession to the Crown, for he forgot not to put her in mind of him by pre∣sents. This had been worthy of commenda∣tion, if he had done it only as a testimony of gratitude to her Father, but he may well be thought to have carried on a farther design in it, for we find not any such thing done in relation to the Princess Elizabeth the other Sister; and whether or no he did then discern some declination in the health of King Ed∣ward, who is said to have died of a Consump∣tion, it is not easie to unfold. Yet such was the iniquity of those times, as his great fore∣sight could not prevent his being involved, together with the rest of the Privy-Council, all the great officers, and most of the eminent persons in and near the Court and City of London, in a danger (even by way of oppo∣sition to the said Princess Mary) which in pro∣bability would have swallowed up any small number of them, if they had been severed.
For the Duke of Northumberland, foreseeing the certainty of the King's death, had so wrought upon his tender age and weakness, as to make him (as far as in him lay) to dis∣inherit both his Sisters, and to establish the Succession in the Lady Jane Grey, his near kinswoman then joined in Matrimony to the Lord Guilford Dudley, one of the Duke's Sons. This was done by Testament, and because there was an Act of Parliament to the contra∣ry, the Duke thought it not of sufficient vali∣dity, without the concurrence and confirmation of all those who were then in power; where∣fore he caused a Subscription to be tendered to every one of them, and so apprehensive were they of his displeasure with the consequences of it, as there is no refusal recorded but that of Sergeant Hales one of the puney Judges, for it seems that all the rest subscribed. This action of his may seem to question both the Integri∣ty and wisedom of our Progenitor, and to vin∣dicate him in it will require a digression of some length. To plead infirmity as a defence, is not worthy of a person so eminent for wisedom, though Metus qui potest cadere in virum fortem, doth very much excuse; and though it may very well become a Statesman to prevent a present danger with the hazard of a much grea∣ter in the future, for as the Italians say Chi ha tempo ha vita, He who hath time hath life; which consideration made the then chief Ju∣stice of the King's Bench upon this very occa∣sion,
when his Brother of the Common Pleas told him that they might both of them be hanged twenty years after, if they should sub∣scribe the Testament, to return this Answer, That it was most true, but yet as true, that if they subscribed it not, the Duke of Northum∣berland might chance to hang them presently. But in my opinion it is not much to be doubt∣ed but Sir Edward North had for his security a better reserve, which is this, a knowing that the Princess Mary had received assurances from him, to be faithfull to her and to her in∣terests in the way of allegiance, next to her Brother's person and Posterity, if any should be; which made her notwithstanding this Subscription, not only to continue him in his former dignity, but to advance him a degree higher in the very first year of her reign. And this course of his, to hold himself in power with an intention to serve his lawfull Sovereign who knew that intention, could not but be very serviceable to her, and being so, how could it give any great offence in a thing so generally done? And as for his own con∣cernments, it cannot well be doubted but they would prompt him to his then compli∣ance, self preservation at that very time be∣ing conceived necessary by so many persons of known wisedom; for though not impossi∣ble (as in nature where A privatione ad ha∣bitum non datur regressus,) yet it is very diffi∣cult, for persons once outed to obtain a resti∣tution
of Dignities and Possessions; and some∣times it cannot be had at all, even by those who seem to be very much advantaged with the present Governours, as may appear in the Posterity of the Duke of Norfolk, and of the Lord Dacre of the North, whose Predecessours suffered for correspondence with Mary Queen of Scots, and yet when the Son and Grand∣son of the same Queen came to wear the Crown successively, they could not recover their former rights. For ingenuity or open sincerity, it is a most Christian vertue, yet since the wisedom of the Serpent is an allow∣ed companion to the innocency of the Dove, that vertue cannot be so strictly required in a Statesman, as in other persons, for else it had been a very horrid thing in David, a man ac∣cording to God's own heart, to suborn his friend Hushai to profess himself a Servant to his Son Absalom, with an intention to sup∣plant him and to subvert his Counsels, for that action of David's is not at all disapproved of in Scripture as others were. But to return to our business, In the year of our Lord 1553, King Edward came to the period of his life and reign, which though glorious for a great pro∣gress in the Churches reformation, yet other∣wise was but turbulent, by reason of a pre∣suming upon the King's minority, both by the Commons who in several parts of the King∣dome arose in Rebellion, and did it so dan∣gerously, as the State thought good to use
Foreigners in the suppression of them, a thing very unusual in this Nation, and by the grea∣ter Nobles who divided themselves into Facti∣ons, which some of them nearest in relation to the King himself, paid for, with the loss of their Heads even in his days, and others upon grounds then laid very shortly after. Upon King Edward's death, this Kingdom fell from a condition of instability which it had often felt during the nonage of its Princes, to an estate which was then altogether unexperien∣ced by us, to wit, the government of a Queen regnant, a thing which the French Nation professeth utterly to abhor, and is cal∣led by them Tomber en quinoüille, or to fall under the Distaff. It is true, that this Crown had frequently passed to the Progeny of our Sovereigns Daughters, but before this time it was never set (much less settled) upon the head of any Woman. This might have raised great storms, but it pleased the Divine Provi∣dence so to dispose of things by way of pre∣paration, as the Pill was swallowed down with great quietness; for first there was not then in being with us any male Prince of the bloud, as Philip de Valois had been in France, who there assumed the Crown to the disheri∣son of our Edward the Third; then this Na∣tion had given its consent in Parliament to an Entail of the Crown upon Mary and Eliza∣beth Daughters to King Henry. And last of all the Duke of Northumberland's ambition
not being able to make way otherwise, had endeavoured to fix the Crown upon another Lady of Royal bloud, his Daughter in Law, so as by reason of this competition all the active spirits of the Nation, having no other adherence, became quickly engaged with one of the Competitresses, and so the other no∣velty was wholly put out of thought. The affection of this People was then so great to a right Succession in the race of their Princes, as notwithstanding hazard of the Churches late reformation (which a great part of the Nation had then set their hearts upon) and the interest of the most eminent persons be∣come possessours of Church-lands by way of exchange and otherwise, yet the Duke of Northumberland soon found the weakness of his designs which he thought so strongly laid, and being forsaken by his party, became an assistant in the proclaiming of Queen Mary; but it was too late to prevent the loss of his Head, which had shewed it self so dange∣rous. Thus Queen Mary, having her Sovereignty generally acknowledged, began her Reign, and being desirous to give some testimony of a gracious disposition, she gave free pardon to all saving the Duke of Northumberland, the Lady Jane, and some few others. The Lords of the Council, who had subscribed against her, and for some time had seemed to act in the same way, were included in the Pardon,
and some of them continued in that great ho∣nour and trust; which may seem strange, considering that the designs of Queen Mary were so diametrally opposite to those of King Edward in point of Religion, but the same opposition was between the Ecclesiastical po∣licy and religion of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, yet many of the old Counsellours were also held on by the latter; and it seems fit (if not necessary) that it should be so, for great changes in a State cannot be wrought sud∣denly without great danger, and the doing of it maturely and judiciously, requireth not only an exact knowledge of matters former∣ly transacted, but also of their grounds and causes. Of the Counsellours retained, Sir Edward North easily obtained to be one, and not only so, but in the first year of this Queens reign, he received an encrease of Dignity, being called to sit in Parliament as a Baron, which is a cha∣racter of the Queens favour not then extend∣ed to any other of the old Counsellours, though many of them held themselves in favour with her even to the time of her death. And this sheweth that she intended a special reward to him, and presupposeth a merit contracted by the performance of some former service of eminence. It cost her nothing, yet was it of very high value, for the dignity of Peer∣age was rarely conferred upon any but persons of great worth and merit during the reigns of
these two Sisters, though under the succeed∣ing Princes it became not only more common but a kind of merchandize for the benefit of Courtiers. And now it appears how season∣ably he parted with his office of Chancellour of the Augmentations, for he did it upon va∣luable consideration, whereas his successour Sir Richard Sackvill, who held himself in grace all Queen Mary's days, yet lost it with∣out any recompence at all. One of the most remarkable occurrents du∣ring this Queens Reign, was her marriage with King Philip the Second of Spain, and considering that Edward Lord North is by our Historians specified in the catalogue of those Lords who were employed in his reception, and there∣fore likely as a Counsellour to have concur∣red all the way in the negotiating of that affair, perhaps it may not be thought impro∣per to touch somewhat upon it. It might well be apprehended as a great danger to this People, for their Queen to match with a more potent Prince of another Nation, in respect that this Kingdom might by such means become a Province, being deprived of the presence of their Sovereign: But the transactours well knew, that this great King (whose vertues were so many, as they can∣not find sufficient room in this small Treatise) was before his marriage here provided of a Son, to inherit his great Kingdom in case there had been issue by Queen Mary, which
issue nevertheless of hers should have enjoyed the Burgundian Provinces, a great accession to his Crown, and free from the inconvenience before mentioned. And all other particulars were so well provided for in that business, as there appeared little intermixture of the Na∣tions in the government during the Queens life, and no inconvenience at all upon her death. For Edward Lord North, he continued in good favour all the time of Philip and Mary, for he held his Counsellourship and was power∣full with the Queen to obtain grace for others, as may appear by the restitution in bloud of a person very highly descended and wrought by his mediation, which also could not but be a matter of good profit to him. And now this Queens reign not affording more matter rela∣ting to the subject of this discourse, I must not leave untouched a reflexion indiscreetly cast upon this noble person by Mr. Fox in his Acts and Monuments, which is this. He saith, that he himself spake with a Woman who told him, that near the expected time of Queen Mary's delivery (for she conceived her self to be with Child, and the whole King∣dom was possessed with such an expectation) the Lord North and another Lord came to her, and would have prevailed with her to part with a child of hers newly born, but that she utterly refused it; and this Mr. Fox conceiveth to have been desired as a supposi∣titious Child for the Queen. The design it
self is so unprobable, either to have been truly such, or to have been carried on by a person of so much honour and wisedom, as it needeth little answer, for the Queen her self was too vertuous (and religious in her way) to admit of such a thought; Neither if there had been such an intention, could it possibly have been concealed, being the concernment of so great Princes and Nations. And questi∣onless the succeeding Queen would never have cast the least honour, or placed any trust up∣on this Lord or his Son Roger Lord North, (whom she made a Privy-Counsellour and near officer about her) if she had given the least credit to that Calumny. It is therefore a wonder that Mr. Fox should insert in his History so trivial a thing, and casting so great a Scandal, having received it from a mean person (in an extrajudicial way,) who per∣haps might be hired to the affirmation, for certainly he could not have found a more rea∣dy way to abate the credit of his other Nar∣rations. But however it was concerning Queen Mary's conception, whether it were only fancied by her, or in it self real with an abortion following, it is certain that she lived not long after, for she fell presently into a deep sadness of spirit, and ended her days in the year 1558, having reigned but a short time, and very unhappily even in her own opi∣nion, for she thought the loss of Calais (which was the last footing of our Nation in France)
to be an irreparable blemish to her govern∣ment; yet was there much bloud shed at home for Religion. which better might have deserved her sorrow, but she according to the Prophecy of our blessed Saviour, thought she did God good service in it. She was a Princess very eminent for Vertue and Piety, but too flexible (a weakness incident to her sex, which is not so fit to govern in pub∣lick matters,) referring almost all to others, but especially in matters of Religion to her Prelates. These she should have considered, as too much interested and over-violent in things tending to their own power and greatness. The subjects of a Tyrant, who manageth his own affairs, prove for the most part not so unhappy, as of those of a mild Prince who putteth the whole care of Government upon some choice instruments, for they be∣come many Tyrants in stead of one, and being of a more servile condition, are usu∣ally steered by more sordid ends. Yet is the Prince himself answerable for their faults, and so certainly was this Queen, and the ra∣ther because in respect of her engagement to uphold the Papal power, she may be thought not to have given an unwilling consent to those horrid cruelties, but Sanguis martyrum est semen Ecclesiae, which saying it pleased God to verifie most strangely at that time, as may appear in the Reformation perfected and settled immediately after Queen Mary's days.
Queen Elizabeth's entry upon her Reign, was embraced with a general applause, by the Protestants cordially, for they concluded her well affected to their principles, and by the Papists seemingly, because she was yet theirs in outward profession, as appeared by the Popish Ceremonies used at her Corona∣tion; yet these could not but be very distrust∣full, knowing her interest to be directly op∣posite to that of her Sister, for if the Pope had power to Legitimate the marriage with Katharine of Arragon, Mother to Queen Mary, then that with Ann of Bullen, Mother to Queen Elizabeth, being solemnized living the other, must of necessity be invalide. This Queen presently made an alteration at the Council-Table, retaining some, and dis∣missing others. Of the latter sort was Ed∣ward Lord North, and whether or no it was his own desire by reason of age and infirmity we know not, but certain it is that he was not under any great displeasure, for the Queen finding it requisite to erect a Lieutenancy for command of the Militia, and ordering of Mu∣sters in each County, made choice of him for that trust in Cambridge-shire and the Isle of Ely. This she did in the first year of her reign, and by another Patent in her second year, she confirmed it unto him. But this power was soon resumed, and as I conceive, laid down generally for the present, which gi∣veth occasion to say something Historically of the Militia of this Kingdom.
Anciently the Martial forces were of two kinds, extraordinary or ordinary. The extra∣ordinary consisted of Mercenaries, serving for Pay, and taken into service upon the occasion. The ordinary were partly such as lay under an obligation by the tenure of their Lands to serve their Prince, and this comprized all the Nobility and Gentry of the Land with their Tenants; and these were they by whose help our Kings made so great Conquests, and be∣came so formidable abroad, for if the Tenants answered not the expectation of their Land∣lord, it was in the Landlord's power to turn them out of the Estates which they held, but especially such as were Copyholders. This power of great men, as it was extremely use∣full against Foreigners, so it grew dangerous at home, for that means there was great and frequent oppositions made against the Princes, by Civil War managed by the Nobles, whose Tenants were necessitated to serve them, and this made the Kings so far to diminish this power upon Tenants at Will, by frequent decisions of their Judges, giving to Copyhol∣ders a Tenure by custom, as they grew alto∣gether deaf at the call of their Landlords; And so it was found by this our Edward, and others who would have used their Tenants for service of the Crown in foreign wars under Henry the 8th. This was some incon∣venience to the Prince, but little in compari∣son of that which hath shewed it self in these
latter times, wherein the Commonalty or third Estate hath assumed a power, not only to subject their Sovereign to a jurisdiction established by the said Commons, but to abo∣lish the Regal power it self, and as a consequent thereunto, to bring the ancient Peerage to a level with themselves. And this may be very much attributed to the former extirpation of power in great persons, who stood as a wall of defence between Prince and People. The other part of the ordinary Militia consisted in the arraying of all persons fit for War defensive, and this was first managed by Commissioners of Array, authorised from time to time by the Kings themselves, which made them to coun∣tenance it much more than the other. But in process of time this power residing in many, who are more subject to find out dilatory scru∣ples than a single person, gave occasion to the Princes more to affect the placing of it in some one, for one may more easily be commanded, and is more subject to an account upon mis∣carriage. But on the other side this gave more offence to the Commons in Parliament, who bear the Purse for supply of their Princes ex∣traordinary occasions, which perhaps might be the cause of Queen Elizabeth's laying it down for that time, though she resumed it afterwards. After this, it appeareth not that Edward Lord North ever desired other than an exemp∣tion from publick employments, with a quiet
enjoyment of himself and of the fruits of his past labours; and in this it pleased God to bless him very far, for he had little publick molesta∣tion, yet was he not free from disquiet at home, by reason of some apprehensions arising within his own family by the prodigality of his eldest Son, for whom as is exprest in his Will, he was constrained at the last to pay a great debt, besides much of the same nature formerly. In those days the sum which he paid was esteemed very great, yet was not the debt so considerable in his thoughts, as a dis∣position in his Son (easily discernible as he esteemed) to proceed in the same way of ex∣pence. He feared that this would make the young man to exceed all bounds when he should become master of his Estate, which made the impression so deep with him, as he failed not to admonish his Son in the said Will with very great reflexions upon him, as to his prudence; and perhaps it wrought great ef∣fects after the Father's death. And here may be noted, that the ablest persons make their judgments as to the future with great incer∣tainty, for Roger Lord North proved a most industrious and provident man, and a person of great honour, for he was Ambassadour ex∣traordinary from Queen Elizabeth to Charles the 9th. of France, and bare many other pu∣blick employments abroad and at home, till at the last he became Treasurer of the houshold to the Queen, and one of her Privy-Council,
dying with that Character upon him, in which he exceeded his Father. Neither had Edward Lord North any greater hopes of Sir Thomas North his other Son, who though a man of courage, a man learned (as appears by divers translations of his,) and indued with very good parts otherwise, yet never had a steadiness comparable to his Brother, which made the Father to settle his Estate by way of Entail, as strongly to prevent Alienations as the Law of those times would bear, with a remainder to his Kindred of Walkeringam, as hath been already touched. And in the year 1563, he made the Will before-mention∣ed, and constituted Sir William Cordall and Sir James Dyer Executors of the same, both of them persons very eminent in those times, Sir William being Master of the Rolls, and Sir James Dyer Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In the year succeeding, having crown∣ed his wisedom by a discreet settlement of his private fortune, he paid his last debt to Na∣ture, ending his life with the Julian year on the last day of December, and so changed this for a better, being then about the 68th. year of his age, as near as we can gather by conjecture. Thus terminated the life of this noble and wor∣thy person, who hid not the talent where∣with his Maker entrusted him, but improved it for the advantage of his Nation and Family, which ought to be an eternal honour to him. His marriages were two, whereof the first
was to Alice Squier Daughter to a Gentleman estated in Hamp-shire, she then being Widow of Edward Myrfyn Son to an Alderman of London, so named, and having also had a for∣mer Husband called Brigantine or Brickenden, and by each of these Husbands one Son. By this Wife he had four Children, whereof Ro∣ger Lord North and Sir Thomas North have already been named, and in some sort Characte∣rized herein. The other two were Daughters, whereof Christian the elder was married to William Earl of Worcester, and Mary the young∣er to Henry Lord Scroope of Bolton. Of eve∣ry one of these four there is Posterity left, and now grown so numerous in the whole, and it is become so far an honour to their com∣mon Progenitor, as I my self, who am the Grandchild of his Grandchild, may in the year of our Lord 1658, affirm, that I know not any of the Race that have as yet applied themselves to courses dishonest or dishonour∣able. This Lady Alice, as she brought him a considerable estate in Marriage, so she was a great and constant assistant to him in the im∣provement of his fortunes, always shewing her self a discreet and provident person in the government of his domestique affairs; and she continued so till the time of her death, which hapned some four or five years before that of her husband, who failed not to yield a fair mention of her goodness in his Testament, desiring also to be buried with her at Kirt∣ling.
His second and last Wife was the Lady Margaret Widow to Sir David Brooke, and surely she was a person worthy of his choice, for he shewed much care of her in his last set∣tlement by Will, which is all that I shall need to say of her. By his Picture, whereof there is yet a co∣py remaining with us, he appears to have been a person of moderate stature, somewhat inclining to corpulency, and of a reddish hair. As for his inward abilities, it were extrava∣gant to question them, in a man so versed in affairs of State as a Privy-Counsellour, and that sate at the Stern so many years in an eminent place of Judicature. Such persons seldom want elocution sufficient, but if we may judge of his Oratory by his Letters, he seemed rather to have affected the delivery of a full and clear sense, than any curiosity of style or expression. I have heard, that being quick of apprehension he was much inclin'd to sudden anger, wherein certainly he great∣ly moderated himself, for otherwise he could not so well have undergon employments re∣quiring so great a temper. The bravery of his mind may best be judg∣ed of, by his delight to live in an equipage ra∣ther above than under his condition or degree, as hath been already hinted, and by his mag∣nificence in other kinds, but especially by his buildings, which were very noble for mate∣rials and workman-ship, as may appear by the
two houses which he set up at Kirtling and Charterhouse, both in being at this day▪ To prove that he was a great lover of Learning and Scholars, we have two witnesses no ways lia∣ble to exception, The first is the University of Cambridge, whose body hath no consider∣able revenue, but what ariseth from the Par∣sonage of Burwell given by him. And it were pity to omit the manner of that Settle∣ment, since that by it he exprest a desire of future correspondence between that Universi∣ty and the chief of his Family; for to the Vi∣caridge of Burwell, during its vacancy, the University nominates two Clarks, and the Lord North for the time being, presents one of them at his choice. Our other witness is Peterhouse, the ancientest College of that Uni∣versity, to which foundation, as a token of his gratitude for that which he gathered there in the way of Learning, he gave the Parson∣age of Ellington, and so became one of their best Benefactours, as they cannot but acknow∣ledge. As for Piety and Charity, it will be hard to give evidence in particular about a hundred years after a man's decease, farther than may be extracted from Records and publick Monu∣ments. Under the head of Piety, I think we may comprehend his care to provide Chapels in such houses as he built, for thereby appears a desire in him of an assiduity in the service of God by himself and his family, which care of
providing peculiar places for divine Service within Families, was too much neglected in the age immediately following, as may be wit∣nessed by many great and stately Houses then built. And may it not fall under the same ti∣tle of Piety, to build a Chapel expresly for the enterment of his Posterity, for though the main superstition was expired, yet Burials in those days were attended with the performance of much religious duty? Under the title of Charity I shall place the above mentioned gifts to the University, and to Peterhouse, and I may add to them a care had in his Testament, of some persons no ways relating to him in bloud. And if Charity be truly said to begin at home, then it may fall under that head, to make provision of a fair subsistence for his Po∣sterity, according to the degree wherein they were placed (as far as it might be done without obliquity in other kinds,) and that was always driven at by this noble Lord. For the Cha∣pel of Enterment, it was raised by him, ad∣joining to the south-part of the Chancel in Kirtling Church, and there at the very jun∣cture of the Chancel and Chapel, he himself is entombed with a decent Monument of Black Marble, erected by his Executors, and the en∣suing Inscription, Edvardum Northum finxit natura beatum, Addidit & magnas gratia Regis opes;
Providus & sapiens magnos suscepit Honores, Et tamen in tanto Comis honore fuit. Quae natura dedit, quae gratia principis auxit Omnia Mors una sustulit atra die. Now having brought this noble Lord to his Epitaph, that which I have more to say is to the Epitaph it self, and this it is. That the Poet hath mentioned some vertues which were purposely omitted by me, as being to be found there, but he is fallen much short of the Per∣son's merit, and of that which might easily have been expressed in so many lines. Perhaps the latter may be said of my relations and de∣scription of him; but for me, I shall satisfie my self with the knowledge of my fair inten∣tion, having chosen rather to be defective, than wholly to omit the performance of that which by me was conceived to be little less than a duty. And so I set a period to this bu∣siness. As all by Natures fatal course must dye, So all are shar'd in vast Eternity; The wise as brightness of the Heaven shall shine, While others by their crimes obscur'd remain.Dan. 12. Let pious actings then adorn our Story, Thus Death brings Fame, and leads to endless Glory. FINIS.
To the Reverend the Master of St. Peter's Col∣lege in Cambridge, and to the Fellows and Scholars of the same. GENTLEMEN, AFter a violent tempest (and of continuance scarcely compatible with such violence) a∣bout the government of our Church, State, and Nation, when at last there appeared some serenity of the heavens, and days that may well be term∣ed Halcyon in respect of the former, I being a person who by reason of a publick trust had been involved to the bearing of some part in those ac∣tings, (though of a temper totally abhorrent from those Salamanders that were delighted in such a fiery residence) found my self restored to some kind of freedom, and was so far from thinking it improper for me, as I conceived it a kind of pie∣ty and duty in respect of Relations in bloud and gratitude, to bestow some of my spare time in the perusal of Parchments and Papers, () concerning the life and transactions of a noble Progenitor of my own, who in a publick way of eminency lived serviceable to his Generation when God gave him being; and consi∣dering that he flourished in a time remote from the present, and little relating to our late affairs, I conceived that I might inoffensively transmit my Observations to Posterity, not omitting the deli∣very of some truths which may seem to be of ge∣neral concernment. This made me reduce my
Notes to some kind of Method, and doing so I cannot but wish unto them a competency of dura∣tion, they having not only reference to a person whose memory is most dear unto me, but being a kind of Issue or Off-spring of my own, which last is a consideration too apt to beget a partiality of Affection if not of Judgment. I never coveted the honour of the Press, much less should I do it in a time of so much prostitution. It shall there∣fore satisfie me to recommend this small Discourse of mine in the way of Manuscript to some of those who may acknowledge themselves to have relati∣on to it, and I hope it will not prove offensive if I make this my first address unto your Society, since you are not ashamed to own Edward Lord North (who is the only Subject of this little Work) as one of your noblest and most free Be∣nefactours. And for my self, though when first I became a Cantabrigian, my Parents put me to suck at the breast of another House, as my Nurse, which hath secured unto her the chief place in my affection, yet the Ʋniversity being my Mo∣ther, I cannot but have a special respect unto yours, as being her most ancient foundation. I dare not term Peterhouse the heart of the Ʋni∣versity, because it would draw too much envy upon you, yet none of her Sisters can deny that she had the property of the heart to be Primum movens, and I think that neither they nor we can with any patience admit the least thought of a trial by ultimum moriens. I may justly af∣firm that no man can wish unto your Fraternity
a longer and more happy continuance, for my de∣sire extends even to perpetuity it self, if the na∣ture of things could bear it. The truth is, that I do presage a very great length of time, finding the dispensations of Divine Providence to have been such as seem to design the prevention of a second Chaos, which state of darkness and con∣fusion, should it once overspread the Land could not but put the great Luminaries of it to the ha∣zard of being extinguished. Blame me not there∣fore if I desire to deposite with you this small Tractate, which may be dear to some of us in re∣spect of its Relations, though not precious in it self, as being a Portraict drawn by an unskilfull Artist, and set out with ill mixed colours. But such as it is, the care of preserving it is a trust, and if you shall be pleased so far to accept of that trust, as to afford a place in your College Li∣brary to this little Work (being the Hand-wri∣ting of a Lady) it will lay a fresh obligation upon him who already is Yours most affectionate to serve you DƲDLEY NORTH.
To the Reverend the Vice-Chancellour, and other the Heads and Governours of the Uni∣versity of Cambridge. IT was an effect of Superstition in the ancient Heathen, to ascribe unto Fountains of most Eminence a kind of Divinity, finding in them a perennity more than is to be had in other su∣blunary beings; which Art of theirs was not on∣ly Impious in it self, but Injurious to the true Deity, for how can that be justly imputed to any part of the Creation, which is peculiar to the Creator, that infinitely pure Essence, from whose effluence all that is, or hereafter can be, must have its derivation? Yet certainly it can no way participate of evil, to afford honour next to those Divine, unto fountains of Learning, which learning so adds light to natural Reason, as gives it ability to search into all the secrets of Nature, and to unfold those mysteries, which we have by Divine revelation, so as to impart them with advantage unto Subjects capable of such sublime notions. Such a fountain is our Ʋniversity of Cambridge, from whom (together with her Sister of Oxford) this Nation must ac∣knowledge to have received the honour and hap∣piness, not only to enjoy it her self, but to have imparted to Foreigners, much of that encrease of knowledge both Natural and Theological, wherewith the World is at this time furnished. Of this honour and common benefit the heart of each intelligent Englishman ought to receive an
impression, and more especially the heart of such persons as are Sons of either Ʋniversity. But because Gratitude concealed yields little fruit, therefore I (though one of those who have taken from the Cantabrigian Helicon least water) hold my self bound rather to break silence than to run the hazard of being censured for Ingrati∣tude. And because I have nothing worthy in it self, to be offered to my Mother the Ʋniversity, I adventure to present unto Her (by an address unto you Her chief Officers) that which may be esteemed worthy in respect of relation unto Her self, which is the Life of Edward Lord North, one of Her chief Benefactours. And that he was so, may appear by this, that the Patronage of Burwell Rectory was his Inheritance, and ap∣propriated to the Ʋniversity of Cambridge by his solicitation and favour with the then King, and (as we firmly believe) at his own charge: This is the most profitable Possession (as I have heard) that the Ʋniversity is endowed with, and yet the matter is so far mistaken, as in your Annual Commemoration of Benefactours, Edward Lord North is wholly left out, and the gift of Burwell is attributed only to Henry the Eight, his Prince and Master, with whom it was too usual to assume unto himself the honour of other mens Bounty and Charity. For proof of this I must request your perusal of the ensuing short Tractate, and the Transcript of an Evidence subjoined to it, which cannot but be upon Record somewhere. When you shall have given me so much reading, and dele∣gated
some person to make search in your Wri∣tings, I shall have no reason, either to doubt your assent to what I have affirmed, or to des∣pair of right to be done in future commemorations. And you cannot blame us of his Progeny, if we be unwilling to lose the honour of his having been Benefactour to so honourable and eminent a So∣ciety. As for Edward Lord North. I may well hope, that upon reading, you will find him a per∣son worthy to be owned in such a Relation. And for the Discourse it self, I am unwilling to doubt your affording it the honour of a place in the Ʋniver∣sity Library; for though it were written in a time of unparallell'd trouble and confusion, when the best conversation of Good men was with their own thoughts, and when Historical Truth was dangerous, yet it containeth (as I think nothing apt to give offence, and perhaps something of Hi∣story will be found there, which untouched by others, may become a pleasing entertainment to the Reader. I must not omit the asking your pardon, for filling empty Leaves with those abrupt Oc∣casionals, which durst not have appeared in your presence alone, and have little to say for them∣selves, but that they are born of the same pa∣rent with the other. I must confess in both parts a great vacuity of learning, and that the style will be found rough and unpleasant, both which faults are scarce pardonable with Scholars, yet having a sincere intention in the address, I cast my self upon your favour, and am Yours most affectionate to serve you, DƲD. NORTH.
