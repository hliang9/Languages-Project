❧ To the Heroicall min∣ded Gentleman, Maister Humphrey King. BY the Authors im∣mutable decree, being his last, this booke was desti∣nate to you, and vpō your allowance, to passe for authorised. What he willed, I haue performed. Agreeing in this with the Authors opinion, That the clerest sighted can best iudge of colours. What your experiēce is in this diuine hearbe, al men do
know; and acknowledge you to bee The Souereigne of Tabacco, and for such they do honor you. If I doe not otherwise vse those tearms of skill, & phrases in your commendation, which are com∣monly accustomed to bee set foorth, to the worthie patrons of mens works, which the Author no doubt would haue done if he had liued: it is for want of know∣ledge both of art to do it, and of your perfections, which doe me∣rit more than I can giue sufficient testimonie of; only by the report that runneth of your fame, I doe auouch in one word that you are Most-worthie. And for such I do recommend this rare worke of a
most pretious hearbe vnto you. What may either be said for it, or surmised against it, you know right well; and therefore I doe leaue all men to receaue your in∣struction, and you to Gods mercifull prote∣ction. A. I.
❧ The Printer to the Reader. GEntle Reader, this dis∣course of Tabacco being left in my hands by a gentleman who in his owne particuler had seene great triall of the effects thereof, and as well by priuat conference with men of learning, as by the reading of such authors of credit, who haue reported the strange and woonderfull operati∣ons thereof, he was mooued to make
knowne vnto all men that which the most part did doubt of, touching the vse & practise thereof, as well in ta∣king the smoke of it with the Pipe, the leafe being drie, as in applieng the greene leafe to the cure of many sores and diseases. What he did vn∣dertake and giue me in charge (as it were by his last Will) I haue put in execution, and published the same, according to the request of the partie deceased. Which I haue done with more willingnesse, being credibly in∣formed by diuers of good credit, that besides the effects reported by the au∣thor, of the taking of it with the Pipe; it hath cleered the sight in a knight of great Commaundment and Worship: and cured a gentleman that
long languished of a Consumption. I doubt not but it hath many other strange vertues which are yet vn∣knowne. But these that are alreadie approoued, I doe recommend vnto thy view and vse; and so do I wish thee all hap∣pinesse.
THE DESTINCT and seuerall opinions of the late, and best Phisitions that haue writ∣ten of the nature of TABACCO: Gathered togither for the better as∣surance, and confirmation of the diuers natures and qua∣lities therof. IT is an especial note, which I haue obserued in all mine au∣thors, that in respect of cu∣ring wounds, cuts, or other harmes (almost what∣soeuer) and in which this hearbe is of vertue to heale, whilest it is yet
greene, that the same naturall ope∣rations in it then▪ the verie same are to be had in it, whē it is now dried, according as the Indians of Trini∣dade vse, in laying it in the shadow, and where no wind or sunne come to draw out the power or vertue in exhalations. Indeed it would seeme some∣what much for any man to say, that if the drying of it were acording to the care of them, who here with vs make it their trade to gaine by, that we might attribute so much power to it, being dried after such a ma∣ner: but surely I cannot thinke, but that comming from those poore people, where couetousnesse hath not taught the childe to cut his fa∣thers throat for gaine, or to dissem∣ble with any for profit, we may e∣steeme it either as good as the greene, or at least as that greene
which growes heere in our clime, which reason persuades vs is vn∣apt to bring foth the hearbe in hir naturall heat and vertue being so hote, and our soile so cold. Another thing I haue much wondered at, wherefore diuers ha∣uing discourst so largely vpon the applying it to vlcers, burninges, wounds, & such like, they haue not longer stayed vppon the reportes which they might make of recei∣uing it in pipes, as we now vse, vn∣lesse it be for this, (and indeede I iudge it one of the chiefe causes) that time and experience, which both corrects old and brings forth new things, either had not disco∣uered to those writers the maner of receiuing it as we now vse it, or if they did vse it, yet it had been so lit∣tle time in practise, as they had not seene those conclusions wrought
wrought by it which we haue, and to say truth, who hath long known it an vsuall thing in this part of the world, to drinke Tabacco? and yet who is he that euer knew it longest and can iustly say, that this or that discommoditie is come to him by it, vnlesse drinking it extreamly, he hath changed the good into a bad effect, since euerie extreme vertue is a vice: and then who will either deeme Tabacco worse since he hath abused it, or not iudge him ill de∣seruing so good a benefite, that knowes not how to make his pro∣fite, hauing so easie a meanes as a moderate receipt. And by this meanes I doubt not but some hath both done them∣selues wrong, wronged vs, and done other iniurie, who (if they had not heard of some whom vn∣respectiue drincking had harmed)
would happily haue been soone drawen to vse it for their health, who now remaining feared with examples, shunne it as an inconue∣nience, which els they had enter∣tained as a publicke good. But heere I would not that anie man should thinke I arrogate to my selfe any title of perfection in phisick; far be it from my thoughts that I should interest my selfe vn∣worthily in that, which by no right I can claime: but Salua reuereia, I presume that no man wil impute it as an error to me, that I shuld speak generally in some respects; my ex∣perience shall not detract from their studies, and let no man take offence, that since I speake of my selfe what I haue tried on my selfe, they may thinke I go about to im∣priuiledge their knowledge of that respect which belongs vnto them.
I wie not as willing to expose myself to the rude censure of any, i I thought it would doe anie man more wrong in particular, than it would doe good to  generall, I protest I would not be found a man that would doe wrong: who entertaines my labours is not be∣holding to me, but to him that commands me to doe what I haue done, and to him will I attribute all respect and merit. But to proceed, before I come to mine authors, you shal haue the opinion of a yonger Dr. who loues and hath made as farre trials of drinking Tabacco as any man that is found: who doubts (saith he) but hauing leaues of Tabacco brought from the Indians, and purposelie dried in the shadow, where the working of the sunne nor any o∣therheat may draw ot the life and
power which is found in it, seing that that power and vertue which it groweth with, retyres it selfe into the leafe, and as the Paracesians and Chimists say, is to be distilled and fetcht out by fire; who is so fond as to thinke, that when there is no other means for it to turne into water, or to receiue compositions, but that the thing being as it were breathed by the fire into a mans body, should not conuay it selfe in a most subtile and pearcing sub∣stance, into the distinct parts of our bodies, and not almost worke the same effects in a man, which a ligh∣tening doth in a corrupt ayre, clen∣sing and purifieng it from all sten∣ches and bad vapours? and from hence it is, that a stincking breath, proceeding not from any great or dangerous infection, is (by drin∣king Tabacco fasting in the mor∣ning)
clensed away▪ but it is to be oted, that in this case we are to receiue it in good quantity down, so that it force to cough, and ei∣ther fetch the corruption off the stomacke, which engenders it, or at least wise drieth it vp, and so takes away the cause. For the head-ache, proceeding of any cold or winde▪ experienc hath confirmed examples enow, and our owne reasons, if we wan∣ted examples, might be sufficiently strong to persuade vs, that nothing should be more soueraigne. Who but entends to watch ex∣traordinarily, I could wish he had but seene some of the same effects which it hath wrought in diuers that would neuer credit it, till they had made triall, onely drinking a pipe full at any time when we find our selues drowsy & would wake.
Who hath euer found a more soueraign remedy against coughs, rheume in the stomacke, head, and eyes? from whence it will fetch the humor in so strange quantity, as in some is admirable. There is a certaine kinde of peo∣ple that speak nothing but ridles, they dwell vnder the hot clime of the still yeard, they are somwhat nosie, and very rich in diuers white and red excrements, called Ale∣buttons, I could wish that some of them had the wit after a certaine kind of merry assembling, called the Drunkards round, to allay that same distemperat vapour of pure Rhenish, with a draught or two of this Tabacco. There is a rea∣son if they could hit on it, that would persuade wise men, that af∣ter they haue been in the land of Tanquam, a little of this downe∣ward,
fetch vp that same that makes them so mad in the brains, and I doubt not but some honest remembrancer or other, will put it into their heads that haunt those prouinces, to vse this receipt when they intend good fellowship, and would hold out. But for any direction or order of receiuing it, I will not take away from men of art so much right, as to say directly, you must vse this or that course that which I haue seen most vsed & bringing forth best ef∣fect, is to receiue it in the morning fasting; for commonly men which vse it not idely, find that at that time it doth them most ease. And I would not that any should re∣ceiue it at any time but when he finds himselfe not well disposed, or beeing well, suspects either that he hath surfaited, or something
which he hath in his stomack, may make him ill. I haue found it very excellent and soueraigne▪ beeing tired and weary with iournying too far, but in this the quantety works the ex∣periment, for as a little causeth wakefulnesse, so it beeing taken ouermuch, as sixe or seauen pipes full, it will procure a most pro∣found sleepe; and I haue found it taken away that wearisomnesse in one night, which I haue thought would not haue left me in many daies: and this I put in excecution, to try how that was▪ true that a Spaniard writes of the Indians, who reporteth, that after their tra∣uels and labours, they will drincke vnmeasurably of Tabacco, which (after they had slept) tooke away all wearinesse of body, and makes them as prompt and apt to busi∣nesse,
as if they had been many daies without doing any thing, and surely I found it very neare the truth, for the next day, I did perceiue my wearinesse almost vt∣terly gone, although not quite, which perhaps might be for want of custome, or because my sick∣nesse before was apt to make me feele that longer than I should haue done beeing well. But that I may vse mine opini∣on, which I will not confirme by any precise comparison, I thinke that those writers which haue so effectually written of the nature of Tabacco, by outward applications both knew the secreat effects of the greene leafe, applying it to wounds, and of the dried leafe re∣ceiuing it by pipes: but hearing of so strange a maner of receiuing it, as phisicke was neuer guilty to the
vnderstanding of, they thought it meet to preserue in a perpetuall concealment among themselues, least being knowne to the world, the inhabilitie of other hearbs and deuises being discouered, and this made knowne, it might turne to the common detrement and hurt of their Art; for in reason, why should any man lay open willing∣ly, or suffer another to enter into the secret conceipts and interne∣tie of our knowledge, when such internetie might make it either les prised, or cause a publique cause to receiue a generall disesteeme for a particular occasion. And I doubt not but if an idle Tabacconist, and a hot Phisition were met without a moderator, it would proue a hard question in their naturall reasons, whether hee that first deuised this secret of drinking Tabacco,
being a phisition himselfe, (as surly I thing he was) was worthy to be accompted a good or an e∣uill person, since he (it is likely) for his owne priuat commodity, did make that knowne to many, by the which many haue receiued more losse of gold in generall, than any of them did receiue good, to whom he did first impart it. Well, be he what he will, or what he was, I doubt not but he did a more good deed than hee was aduised of, and therfore de∣serues in mine opinion to be o∣therwise requited than according to the quality of his deserts, which if it may be thought infinite in re∣spect of himselfe, then let not him want his due, for it were sin that since so few men deserue well, any of them should cease to good workes, because they want that
respect in which their worth may interest them. And thus farre for drinking of Tabacco, which is more vulgarly receiued with vs now than euer, and although it seems that the In∣dians
vse to take this Tabacco in other maner of pipes than we, yet I thinke we shall not need to thinke our earthen or ier pipes more vnapt than those which the Indians make of Palme leaues and such like. I could stand longer to per∣suade the world of some wonders that I haue seen effected with one draught of excellent Tabacco, but some that are as hard of beleefe as he that persuaded himselfe a man could not breake his necke with a fall from Paules, if he fell vpon feather beds, I will omit to the oportunity of their owne experi∣ence, which I my selfe once trie vpon one that would in kindnesse face me downe that there was no force in such an idle smoke; but of this I could tell you a long story, and I could make you beleeue he
was ready to bewRAY himselfe, and rent his buttons, and breake his points, if not for anger, yet for some thing else that made him a∣fraid of a worse matter. But to conclude, I will limit no man to any prescript order of drinking Tabacco, nor wish that any should vse it, but as they finde themselues cold in their stomacke, rheumaticke, or hauing the head∣ache, or for diuers other such ne∣cessarie occasions, for I see not how such vnmeasurable drinking should not both harme them that drink it, and wrong others by rob∣bing the world of so singular a treasure as this. I could therefore wish it were a penal law, that who∣soeuer should abuse it by vnmea∣surable and needlesse drinking, should forfait at the pleasure of his Excelsitude, from three times vp∣ward,
so much as he hath wasted-toward the maintenance of Tabac∣co in the treasury, and by this means I feare not, but we should make that our singular profit, which we now turne to our dis∣profit and harme, and that wee should not remaine in that great want of good Tabacco which wee haue done of a long time toge∣ther, but that hoarding Apo∣thicaries might be glad to abate their prises of their mingle mangle which forsooth they will not sell, vnder vnreasonable rate, when there is scarse good to be got, al∣though that which they haue be as bad at the best, as the worst of but indierent good, when good may be bought. That which may be said more I refer to the conceit of them that hold it in her due price, for my
selfe in few, I thinke that there is nothing that harmes a man in∣wardly from his girdle vpward▪ but may be taken away with a mo∣derate vse of Tabacco, and in those parts consist the chiefe reasons of our health, for the stomacke and head being cleare and void of euill humors, commonly the whole bo∣dy is the better. And I will expose the censure herof to many, who I know would proue as aduerse to me in any mat∣ter, wherof I should desire their opinon, as to their enemies▪ yet let them say, that can say most to en∣uy against it, happely some one as wise as a woodcocke will raise his flight on his becke, and crie fie, fie, how it stincks, smell you it not? or tell me he will hire an Irish man to chimney-sweep my sto∣macke, (for woodcocks are a wise
kinde of wild fooles) but can such fooles, fellowes I meane, tell any discommodity it hath brought, I speake it with an vpright feare to God, I thinke man hath not known an excellenter preseruatiue against the late dangerous infecti∣on, than this, and if any one who made vse of it in good order, hath died of the infection, I am truely resolued, that for that one which died, it hath saued threescore, whose esteeme hereof beeing lesse than the merit it selfe, haue preser∣ued themselues by extraordinarily receiuing it amongst company, not for any affection or hope they haue had to fortefie themselues against so dangerous an incident, but by meere power of the hearbe; how many then shall I thinke haue been saued, who knowing in good order to make their profitable vse
therof, haue serued their necessity, and saued their liues? Now to come to the second forme of receiuing this hearbe, I haue made choice of three especi∣all men which write most at large, namely, Charles Stephen, and Iohn Liebault, two Frenchmen, & Aegi∣dius Eurartus: There is likewise Monardes, a Spaniard, who hath written very largely of it, but be∣cause he is already translated into English, I will referre that which he hath very large to his owne vo∣lume. One cause (notwithstan∣ding) makes me to take an occasion to leaue him, and that is, for that hee is a Spaniard of Siuill, and yet is found to haue gathered some reasons which he hath out of other Authors, and yet reports himselfe to haue been conuersant with the Indians, from whence
me thinkes he might well  brought confitions enough▪ to which he  been an eye wit∣nesse, to confirme that which he sees almost the great part of one world to be already confmed. But that you shall not need to seeke farre for him▪ that which he hath, he hath it for the most par to this effect, and thus he pre∣scribes vs our order of receiuing it. The greene leaues (he saith) be∣ing put into the hot embers, and applied to any place euen with the embers, are singular against all aches, opulations in the stomacke, swelling pains of the stone, the mothe, wormes gnawing in the belly and guts, carbuncles, and all euils that come of cold causes. And in wounds either on man or beast in the whole cour of his direction he presents no other rule
but the meere infusion of the uic of Tabacco, beeing brused or stam∣ped, and afterward the wound wrapt vp in a leafe likewise some∣what brused. Now for our two Frenchmen, I will write that more at large which they haue of it, which thus followes. The diuersitie of names giuen to this hearbe. THis hearbe with the French hath been most knowne by the name of Nicotiana: the first occa∣sion was, that (as the Greekes, Ro∣mans, & others, trauailing to India or other places, wher they found plants, vnknowne cities, or lands, they vsually gaue them their owne names, to remaine in memory to posterity that such an one had done his common wealth that ser∣uice) so Monsieur Nicot a French man, Embassadour to the king of
Portugall, sending this hearbe first into France gaue it his name. Others that by tradition haue noted the means from whence they receiued this, haue called it Queene mother hearbe, for that when Monsieur Nicot had sent it commended to her, she first plan∣ted it. Others haue surnamed it of the great Prior, for that such an one re∣ceiuing this hearbe from Lisbone, & hauing first planted it in France, afterward experienst the diuerse vertues & singular natures which he found in it, making it knowne to the world, how much excellent it was: the common people fin∣ding it most vsed by him, and no¦where to be found but in his gar∣den, could giue it no distinct title, but would that it should be caled his hearbe.
Others there want not which cal it Petum Masculine, and yet farre differing in quality and effect, from that the Portugals and Spa∣niards haue called Petum Feminine, but howsoeuer or wheresoeuer this hath receiued that name, it shall suffice that we remember it to haue been most knowne among the french, by some one of these three names, though now perhaps vse and better knowledge hath made it knowne vnto them, as vn∣to vs, by the name of Tabacco. But to proceed. This Monsieur Nicot, being of the councell of the French king, and by him sent of Embassage to the king of Portugall, whilst he yet was lieger there, wold make often resort to see in the records of that country, what diuersity of matter, strange accidents, or other matter
of note might best fit the memory of a man of his estate▪ among other he found that at such a time this Tabacco had been sent as a present (worthy the gratefullest accep∣taunce) from Florida thither, who happily desirous to trie of what trueth a thing of such miracle might be, was by a gentleman (keeper of the Records) presented with a root therof, which he pre∣sently planted in his garden, inten∣ding to try if the fame of the thing were no greater than the thing it selfe, which soone he found, by an aduenture which happened ere he thought of it, for before himselfe had made triall herof to the parti∣cular se of any, it fortuned that a boy which had long time been wearilie tormented and greeued with a dangerous infection or sore, commonly called, Noli me
tangere, had gotten some one leafe of this hearbe, and thinking no∣thing could make his sore worse than it was, applied it to his face, where the sore had eaten away the flesh most pitifullie, and almost rotted his nosthrils, and other partes which it wrought on, (as the nature of such a Canker is) ha∣uing thus applied the hearbe some few times, report was made to the Embassadour how good effect it had wrought, herevpon Monsieur Nicot, caused the childe after he had been with him eight or tenne daies, to be sent to the kings Phi∣sition to haue his counsell, if he saw it needfull, or at the least to iudge and see what good this Ta∣bcco had wrought in so dangerous a sore. The kings Phisition (yet all Phisitiions will not doe so) imme∣diatlie refused to take the child
into his hand to cure, although happily he might haue had much mony for a little paine: but tould the Embassadour that the force of the disease and poyson was alrea∣die destroied by the applying of this Tabacco, and so it was indeed, for within very short time, the pa∣tient recouered and became very sound and perfectly healed of his sore. Afterward, that triall might be made what nature it had in wor∣king in other kinde of sores, it for∣tuned that the Embassadors cooke had most pitifully ut his hand, with one of those great chopping knifes they vse to cut or shread meat withall, who almost despai∣ring of helpe, shewed vnto the steward of the house how sorely he was hurt, and how much he eared the danger of the blow: the
Steward forthwith counceld him to take of Tabacco, and to apply it to the hurt, which after he had done halfe a dosen times, he found his hand very whole and perfectly well, in so much that within few daies the qualitie and nature of this hearbe was very famous in the kinges court, and became as much desired as it was wondered at: and yet that a confirmation herof might be had, A gentleman of good accoumpt who was long time knowne to haue had an vlcer on his legge, for the space of two yeares, desired that the Embassa∣dour would be pleased to bestow some leaues of Tabacco on him (for he did intend after the triall of much surgery, to see if beyond hope any helpe might be found in this hearbe for an incurable euill) who gaue him of it, and willed
him to apply it  fir  the greene leaues, and their o bruise them that the iuice may come forth, and so to apply it to the place infected, which hauing done by the space of nine or tenne daies, he was cured by this, which happely had cost his purse largely, and might haue been to his infinit paine, had he not found this reme∣die, which cost but little, and re∣deemed health, with the smallest trauaile that euer Phisicke found ou. And yet further, to a gentlewo∣man that had a dart rotten in her face, and was past all cure & care of Surgery, the Embassadour caused to be applied this hearbe, not pre∣suming it were able to heale her (that had no hope left her of better than that which she endu∣red) but desirous to see if it were
possible to be healed with Tabacco, which neither Art nor Phisicke could preuaile with: hoping that at the least if it did no good, yet it could doe no ill; and see, he had not applyed this a fortnight, but the gentlewoman was restored to her health, and the sore became perfectly healed, for which so good hap, the poore gentlewo∣man would often repaire to the Embassadour, yeelding him infi∣nite thankes for his happy ende∣uour that turned to so good end. There was likewise a Captaine, whose sonne had that mortall and almost incurable desease which we call the Kinges euill, (because thought to be cured by none but the Princes themselues) he often resorted to the Embassador, bring∣ing with him his sonne, to whome Monsieur Nicot ministred this
, (ordered as before) and it wa not long ere he as the rest was made sound and well, without that euer any thing else was mini∣stred vnto him than Tabacco. The fame and esteeme of Ta∣bacco beeing come into so great re∣quest among those of the kinges court, the Embassadour grew with great diligence and regard to note the vertues therof, and as it were to fore-tell vnto himselfe some great woonder of strange im∣port, (such commonly men con∣ceiue when their hopes exceeding ordinarie bounds, affect that, that happely they finde effected, be∣yond the common course of con∣ceipt) and it was euen about that time, when Monsieur Nico ha∣uing receiued newes that the La∣dy Montegy, a germaine borne, did perish, and as it were went af∣ter
her death to her graue, sorely vexed with an vlcer ingendred of the perilous and hellish sore which we before spake of, and call Noli me tangere; and that at the same in∣stant the Countesse of Ruffe ha∣uing her face perished with a dart, (the like whereof we had also be∣fore) and she hauing now long time had the counsell and often aduises of the best Phisitions that France could affoord, which you may thinke a Ladie of such high esteeme would trie to the highest straine ere she would die, if Phisick might saue her, and that be had for any mony; but when those had left her, and she remained alone left to her last fortune, she vsed of this hearbe, and was cured; for it was not long after that king Fran∣ces the second, as likewise the queen mother, had receiued roots
hereof, which came commended to them from Lisbone, with the manr how to vse and apply it to the sicke. Other experiences hereof were made by the lord of Iarwicke gouer∣ner of Rochel, who in a solempne feast made open report at the queen mothers table, to M. Nicot how he had distilled this Tabacco with an ther little hearb or weed, which he found in the woods, and had therby cured one extreamlie pained with the dsease called As∣maticke, the nature of which disease is, to stop the passage of the wind, and make vs breath vneasily. This hearbe in fourme much resembleth Consonde, and is of so neer a likenesse and resemblance, that you would iudge it to be the greater Consond.
The maine stalke of Tabacco groweth vpright, & big in propor∣tion, his leaues are velueted, and are in growth bigger and larger at the stalke than towards the end of the leafe, resembling the plaine fourme of any other leafe not rag∣ged, saue that you shall haue some leaues broader and larger than both your hands, and in length as much as three hands breadth. Some you shall haue growing very high, somtimes to the heigth of nine or ten foote, yea somtimes a cubit, but that fortunes accor∣ding to the ordering of it when it is sowne. The leaues somtimes grow halfe a foot distant the one from the o∣ther, if it hath any great heigth. The floure of the Tabacco is much like the floure of Niel, some∣times yellow, and somtimes of a
carnation colour, and somtimes in fourme like a bell. And when it casteth the flower, it leaues the former proportion, and taketh the semblance of an ap∣ple, in which you may finde the seeds inclosed very small, appea∣ring not much vnlike to Iusquiasm seedes, which are yellowish: but when they grow to be toward their full ripenesse, then they ap∣peare more neare to a blacke. In those regions from whence we re∣ceiued first the knowledge hereof, Tabacco hath both floure, seed, and leafe, at one instant, but the reason is, those countries of the Indians are better and apter to bring forth sooner such hot hearbes than a cold climate. In the nine or tenth month it springeth very much at the foot, for then is the roote fast∣ned into the ground with a great
sort of very weake strings. Who would make experiment of the greene leafe, to apply it to any vlcer, sore, or cut, shall in bru∣sing of it finde a iuice thicke and slimie, but in the smell it is indiffe∣rentlie well sauoring, although such as haue no vse of the smell would iudge it strong and noisom, in tast it is somewhat biting, it is drie in the first degree, and whoso∣euer would haue it good, should doe wel to sow it in the hottest and most fertill ground, for such it re∣quireth. The best place wherin it will most prosper and be naturally planted in our countries, is where the sunne shineth most, and if it be possible against some wall which may defend it from the North winde, which is an infinite enemy to this hearbe, and withall it were
conuenient that no winde at all, beeing ouer rigourous, should come neere it, for the weakenesse of the stalke caused by the high growth of the hearbe, is such, that a small winde will blow it downe, vnlesse happily it be deeply roo∣ted. If the weather be ouer drie, it will desire much watering. Cold kils this, and therefore all means are to be vsed against it. Who would sow it, ought by the opinion of the best skild in Phisicke, to take this order, first take a dosen seeds of those which you finde inclosed in that part of the seede which resembleth the bell, and put them togither into one hole, about three inches deep in the ground, and the cause why you are to plant it deepe is because the seeds be very small and little, and might be choaked.
If the weather be ouer drie, you shall doe well to water it fifteene daies together. It may be sowne in manner like the hearbe Laistich, whose seeds are mingled with earth or sand. It will seeme long ere it appeare aboue ground, but that will be ac∣cording to the nature of the ground, and yet euen then it will be longer than many other seedes, but immediatly as soone as you see it begin to spring, you shall co∣uer it as much as you can conue∣niently, least that frosts, or cold, or tempestious raine, nip it away, or wash it downe; and after conue∣nient time of growth, you shall take it vp by the roote, cutting vp the ground round about, so that there may none of the strings of the roote be broken, which to pre∣uent, you may very wel wash away
the earth with water, and then re∣plant it again, neer some wal, with∣in two or three foot, but if the ground be not good there, (as commonly it may happen) then prepare with apte manuring it. For the time of sowing it in Eng∣land I agree rather with Monar∣des than these two, who say it is best sowing it in the midst of A∣prill, but I would rather hold it better to sow it in March, for the same occasion that Monardes wri∣teth, howbeit Stephen and Liebault write that the Spaniards and Indi∣ans sow it after haruest. It is hot and drie in the second degree, and therfore fit vndoub∣tedly to purge and clense, by expe∣rience (they affirme) it hath hea∣led Noli me tangere, so named be∣cause it resembleth I thinke a curst shrew that must not be toucht
when shee is angry. It hath healed the disease called the Wolfe, the Canker, the kings euill, all old sores, wounds, et∣ters, broad biles, Apostumes, pricking of the fish called Viues, (the nature of whose touch is to procure infinite bleeding euen to death) and diuerse other diseases, which experience hath not yet brought to light. These men affirme that who so hath the gout, and when the ex∣treamitie of the paine beginneth, rubbeth the infected place with oyle Oliue, and afterwards apply warme leaues of Tabacco, shall find great ease. Who taketh the leaues and seeths them in water, and maketh thereof a sirupe with sugar, and re∣ceiueth of it euerie morning to the quantitie of two ownces, shall
finde how much power it hath to dissolue grosse humors, to ease the hard drawing of the breath, breake an old cough or fleume, & how it causeth dissolution of hard swel∣lings in the body, if before the re∣ceipt heerof we receiue some vni∣uersall purge, and then the iuice of the leaues vnstop the kidney, and softneth the hardnesse by being onely applied vnto the region of the kidny: and in case we want of the leaues, the pouder mingled with any ointment proper to such an euill, is auailable. The same means auaileth in coldnesse of the stomacke, the bellie, the collique, and the inward partes, being appli∣ed to the Nauil. They affirme that in France a man hauing a sore vlcer, or impo∣stume, caused by the euil of naples, that we cal in English the French
something, was immediatly cured therof. It is a singular remedie against soundings, to receiue the smoke as we vse with pipes; & that which is more strange than the world wold credit, the inhabitants of Florida often nourish themselues four or fiue daies together by the smoke, neither eating nor drinking any thing whatsoeuer, and this is most certainly confirmed by that which he writeth. More than this writeth Lie∣bault, that there are which distill water of the green leaues of Tabac∣co in a Limbecke of glasse, which water is no lesse singular in all ef∣fects, than the very iuice, helping all wounds, sores, and bruses, euen restoring to men which by some aduenture haue lost their nailes, new ones, by washing that part
with the water destilled, and after∣ward wrapping them vp in fine linnen clothes, dipt in the water. Some there are also who (to speake like a Chimist) doe distill oyle of Tabacco, per descensum, which oile, these authors (agreing with the Paracelsians) preferre be∣fore all other applications, either of leaues, iuice, or pouder, because the quintescences and extractions drawne out of the simples, are the subtill spirit, and haue the pu∣rest vertue and facultie of the sub∣stance from the which they are drawne. They prescribe vnto vs this kinde of receipt, Take of the choi∣sest and most substantial leaues of this Tabacco one pound, beat them in a morter of Marble, after take halfe a pound of sweet hogs grease, refind and clarified, without salt,
and this being melted, ad to it the Tabacco, and set it ouer a soft fire to seeth deliberatly, vntill such time as you finde the waterish hu∣mour of the Tabacco vapoured a∣way, and that the mingled sub∣stances retaine the fourme of a perfect ointment, this reserue for a singular and medicinable good. Another is this, Take Rosel, new wax, and turpentine, of each three ounces, melt them togither, and then adde vnto them a pound of Tabacco prepared as before, min∣gle them togither, and after with a slow fire set them to incorporat, seething togither fiue or sixe howers, vntill the water of the Ta∣bacco be cleane vapoured away, after this is done, straine it through a course linnen cloath, that may be very strong: afterward take halfe a pound of Venice Turpentine,
and infuse it into these thinges be∣foresaid, without any more boy∣ling of it, but stirring it continual∣ly vntill it be cold, afterwards pre∣serue these as pretious ointments: touching their effects; the first of these two is the better for sores, vl∣cers, carbuncles, tetters, and to dis∣solue, than the second, because Ta∣bacco hath so much the more effica∣cy, by how much there are fewer commixions. The second is better than the first, to consolidate any wound, dissolue impostumes and swellings, & to appease their rage. Further you may make a singu∣lar Baulme, by cutting greene leaues of Tabacco and putting them into a glasse well stopt, if you set it a good time in hot water, or in the sunne, or buried in Ventre equino, by the space of fortie daies, and doubtlesse you shal finde so singu∣lar
a baulme as shal not be lesse ad∣mirable (say mine authours) than that oile which is made by the Pa∣racelsians for all kind of vses that shall be desired in a hearbe of that nature. AeGidius Eurartus in his discourse De herba Panacaea, writeth, how a certaine woman had giuen her cat a very strong poyson, when the poore cat was now in that ta∣king that she could not stand with dissinesse, and striued to void forth the poison in vaine, the woman remēbring her selfe, found means to open her iawes, and making a little ball of brused Tabacco, min∣gled with butter, thrust it into hir mouth, and so swallowing it downe, within a short time shee cast vp all the poison and so was saued.
Lo  wils that we should gather the leaues in the moneth of Iuly, and then bruse and distill them in a double Limbecke, with two spouts of glasse, and keepe this a yeare, for (saith he) this recei∣ued to the quantitie of an ounce, for the increasing of health in a sicke stomacke, is most effectuall. There is likewise a Salt and an Oile to be made of Tabacco, both of them more singular and effectu∣all for all diseases, than either the leaues, or iuice, or water, which the Paracelsians and Chimists general∣ly agree in, because they will that in this oyle should be contained the true life and naturall vertue in greater substance and better qua∣litie than any of the other. Iacobus Gohorius a Parisien, tea∣cheth vs this maner of making of the Salt. First (saith he) calcine this
Tabacco, and afterward dissolue it; poure it into a pipkin, and let it va∣pour according to reason, this shalbe singular for vlcers, and such like, and this is the maner of draw∣ing salt out of all vegitable things, burne your hearbe first in the fire, (yet some vse to drie it in the sha∣dow) but being euen burnt to ashes, you haue the more salt; after∣ward taking a leaden vessell full of most pure cleare water, infuse these ashes, which being set to the fire, let it boile some quantitie, and then poure it into an other vessell, where receiuing it in a clean cloth, let it hang a while by the fire, that the water may drie it selfe cleane away, and not to haue any moi∣sture remaining, and in this cloath being so drie, shall you find that Salt. Another maner is this, take the
hearbe being dried, and put it in∣to a close pipkin, vnder which you shall make fire, vntil it be burnt into a fine white ashe, then let it boile in raine water, or distilled water, vntill the fourth part be cōsumed, then let it stand a while, and after poure it into an other vessell, which shall be full of pure and cleare water, and that which shall goe out of the pipkin, euapo∣rat with a slow fire into a glas-bot∣tle, and the Salt shal remaine in the bottome. Leonardus Fiernantus a famous Phisition of our time, writes that he tooke the roote and seed of Ta∣bacco, and brused them togither, in a morter, the leaues waighed (saith he) foure poundes, afterward he went and laid them in Ventre equi∣n, by the space of thirtie daies, and to the end that it might not
corrupt, he put in some Salt, with sixe ounces of Aqua vitae, then di∣stilling it in Balneo Mariae, euen to the extraction of al the moistnesse, and to the end he might the better conserue it, he added so much oile of Sulpher that it euen smelt of it, and with this composition he serued his turne in sundry occasi∣ons: those which were troubled with agues he was wont to cure heereby, giuing them but one spoonfull at once, those which were wounded or otherwise hurt, if they did either drinke hereof, or bath their wounds in some quan∣tity of it, not without great admira∣tion, he vsed to to cure. These be the opinions that be tearmed Receptiores of this plant, i. that be more receiued than the rest; and these I haue deliuered therfore, not of mine owne (other∣wise
than of mine owne collecti∣on) but from the best Phisitions that haue written latest thereof: if therfore the natures of Tabacco, and the diuerse qualities it hath, be more confirmed than before, it is well, if not, it is neuer the worse, I meane it shall neuer the more nor disable nor derogate from it: this I say, because there be so many heads as there be bodies to beare them, & so many wits, and so ma∣ny iudgements will follow; some of knowledge, some of experiēce, some of fancie, some one way, some another, euery man accor∣ding to his humor: well, the plant hath growen, the Phisition writ∣ten, and the author of this worke hath gathered, who wisheth euery one his due, the planter, the writer, and the reader.
