A perfect Relation of the taking of Leicester, and of the severall marches and proceedings of the Kings Forces since the taking thereof. SIR, TO satisfie your request in your Letter touching the condition of Leicester, I have endeavoured to enforme my selfe from the most moderate and understanding men that were sufferers in that generall losse, and eye-witnesses of the whole carriage of that sad busines, that are since fled hither for refuge. On Wednesday at night May the 28. a strong party of the Kings horse faced the Towne, and by quartering at the adjacent Villages hindred the supplies from the Countrey. On Thursday their Artillery were drawn up neere the Town, and by the direction of some malignants of the town, who had formerly gone out of it, or were put out, their great Guns were planted against some of the weakest places of their workes: by Friday night they made wide breaches, which by the industry of the men and women of the town were some of them made up againe with Wool▪ packs, and other materials; but the enemy pressing hard upon them with their numbers, and that round about the towne they were hard put to it, the enemy being numerous without, and they but few within, and the workes very large; the line is neere three miles in compasse, the foot Souldiers in pay in the towne not exceeding 450, and the townes-men in
armes, with some of the Countrey that came in to their assistance made the souldiary about 1000 in all, who by reason of the small∣nesse of their numbers, and the largenesse of their workes, were enforced to duty Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights toge∣ther, the enemy keeping them in constant alarms, which did so tire out the townes▪ men that they were the more unfit for the re∣fiting the furious enemy, though to give them their due they did as much as could be expected considering the opposition, for the enemy had about 4000 foot, who stormed in so many places at once, that the defendants wanting reserves were the eailier over▪ mastered. The storme began about one of the clocke on Satturday morning May the 31. and lasted at the walls about two howres, the enemy being all this while strongly resisted and lost many in the worke, they were three times beaten backe, but their horse who were behind the foot did force them on againe, about 20 severall bodies of foot storming at once, 200. or 300. in a place, and driven on by as many horse as oft as they were driven to retreat, and when they did breake in they were by ours driven back againe untill oppressed by multitudes, and entring in many places at once ours were driven to the market-place, where our horse that all this while had backed our foot, and kept them to their duty, now were themselves put to it, and did behave themselves resolutely▪ and held the fight in the Town almost an houre after, betaking themselves to places of strength, enforced quarter for their lives, and some of them escaped, having gotten the enemies word (which was God and the Prince.) At their first comming in they slaughtred many, untill ours had laid down their Armes and yeelded them∣selves prisoners and then they fell to their plundering worke, and catching of men to be their prisoners, executing their accustomed cruelty to men and women to finde out their money, and best goods. The Gentlemen of the Committee, Sir Robert Py, and Major Enis were carried before the Princes to their Inne, who disposed them to severall houses as prisoners, the two last upon their Paroll were set at liberty to procure exchange, the Com∣mittee are yet kept prisoners in the towne many other Gentlemen of the Countrey and Officers of the garrison were sent with the best of the plunder to their severall garrisons of Newarke, Litch∣field, and Belvore, 140 cart loads of the best goods and wares in
the shops were sent away by Satturday noone towards Newarke with a convoy of horse. I finde some of the Pamphlets speaking of the horrid cruelty of the insulting enemy, putting man, wo∣man, and child to the sword. I know their tender mercies are cruelties, but give the divell his due, there was indeed many slaine at the first enterance, and some that made little resistance, and some women and children amongst the multitude by the rabble of common souldiers▪ but I cannot learne of any such order given to destroy all, as is said by some, and it is the generall opinion of many that have since got out of the Towne that in the conflict and since there was not slaine of the Parliaments party, souldiers and others, above 100. and some of those in their cold blood, after they had granted quarter of life, picking out some active men and setting common souldiers to quarrell with them and slay them, but of these not many. It is confidently believed that not above 300 are slaine on both sides, the Town was full of wealth which the Countries had brought in for safety, they tooke their nine peices of Ordnance, great and small, above 1000 Muskets: neere 400 horse and armes, and about 50 Barrells of Powder, besides what was spent in the service. The greatest defect was want of men▪ though the Town was not well fortifyed, nor was there Ordnance to reach from one worke to another; It were to be wished that Garrisons of such concernment to the Kingdome might be taken care off, that they might have at least 1000 foot souldiers in pay, which had this place had, with the helpe of the Townes-men, in all probability that might have kept out the enemy, and made them pay for their bold attempt, Colonell Hastings is made Governour there, who now bestirs himselfe in the fortifying the Towne, which if soon visited may in probability yet be regained. Upon Tuesday Iun 3, the Kings horse advanced Southwards, and kept his generall randezvoz at Newton five miles on this side Leicester, on Wednesday he removed to Kiworth five miles from Harbrough and on Thursday morning his horse came to Maydwell eight miles from Northampton and in the afternoon they came to Brixworth and other adjacent Tones and sent out their war∣rants all over the North-East pars of tis County▪ and taxed every Town some at 100 pound, some 200 pound, and some lesse some more, upon penalty of being plundred of their goods, and
their houses fired, and by this meanes they have gathered great sums of mony: and some of the Townes having payd the sum first set, another company comes and chargeth them againe at a second, and after that a third, and all have been enforced to be paid; on Thursday night about eight of the clocke, a party of their horse came within two miles of Northampton, we took that day divers prisoners, who all agreed that the whole body of horse and foote were drawing up this way, which gave us a timely alarum; on Friday and Saturday they continued their taxing the Countrey Townes, and their horse lie in severall places in great bodies to collect their tax, we dayly take of their men in the Townes, and our troopers skirmishing with them, Sir Iohn Nrwich governour of Rockingham hath sent out his troope dayly, who have taken ma∣ny prisoners, he sent in hither 30 at one time to be kept here. On Satturday Iune 7. the King with all his foot and carriages march∣ed from Harbrough to Daventry in Northamptonshire. This night came in our 400 foot had bin before Oxford at the Leaguer▪ and this night Sir Thomas Fairfax his army quarter about Oleny and Newport Pannell, to whom this day joyned Colonell Ver∣uden with his 2000 horse and 500 Dragooners, the two armies being within 16 miles each of other. The Kings army drive men and cattell along with them, that the Townes may come after them and redeeme them for money: The Kings head quarter is this day at Daventry eight miles from Northampton, his horse in the villages adjacent, he hath about 14 peeces of Ordnance, and about 200 carriages, much of the wealth of Leicester▪ and his men are full of money they plunder from the Country, the King drives multitudes of Beasts and Sheep before his Army, it is supposed to recrute Oxford; this day we tooke eleven of theirs prisoners, and slew five, most of them full of money and good cloathes, those that have seene both Armies say they differ not much in numbers▪ the Kings horse seeming more, but not so good nor so well armed, and his foot nothing so well provided as ours, the Lord give us courage and faithfulnesse▪ nd stand by us in the day of battell, and find out and discover those have occasioned so much misery to the heart of the Kingdome, I am confident the Counties of Stafford, Warwick, Leicester, and Northamption have suffered more within six weeks then would pay our new army six moneths, and their weekly taxes
and other charges for 12. to the utter undoing of many thousands, and the impoverishing of others both friends and foes, for I am sure I can have abundant testimony from those that at first had them welcom to Town, and directed them to the roundheads houses and grounds, where they first began their cruelty, but it ended on their pates as well as purses, that thought they should have found them their friends; for the good party having obscured themselves, they to keepe their hands inure exercised their cruelty one whom they could meete, And found their cattell would yeeld as round money as others, and they to be delivered from their cruelty would give as round sums; those pretended to be their friends, they with horred execration cursed, and bad them if they were friends bring in their money, swearing at the next progresse they would not leave them worth a penny, telling them all they had was the Kings, and he had given it to them would fight for him, they having no other pay. On Sabbath day I . there came in divers souldiers both horse and foot from Leicester that had bin prisoners about a weeke, and were exchanged for so many of Esham prisoners sent hither▪ in all 100 horse and foot souldiers, the like number being to be released here for them) and they informe us that there was 300 released on Thursday last, for so many from Warwick, Coventry and Staf∣ford; Here is yet about 100 more, most of them lately taken in this Countrey of the Kings party, which will release more, the enemy no knowing what to doe with so many prioners; few of the 800 souldiers horse and foote taken prisoners at Leicester would by any meanes take up armes for the other party though they were dayly sollicited both by threats and promises: onely on Smith a Lieutenant who let thm▪ i as soone as hee could, is since made a Captaine by Colonell Hastings, and hee perswaded bout fourty foote souldiers to take up armes with him, but some of them have since disserted him, and got to Coventry: All speake the feaseablenesse of regaining the Towne, if attemp∣ed before the n  be made▪ which they ae aout to do in a part of the Towne; and of their cruelty to the Scotts, slaying divers of them in cold bloud after quarter given to them, but this is sayd to be by the Irish in the Kings Army, and Eng∣lish Papists their adherents. The King still continues at Daventry
and our army in their quarters, our horse have bin abroad this day and slaine two of the enemy and brought one prisoner, I heare but of one of our men lost in all these encounters▪ and he is come home upon exchange; I have bin more particular and large then ordinary, because you wrote twice for the same thing, an seeme to be affected with the businesse of Leicester, which we have all ause to be, and I pray God we may never forget to doe them the best good we can by our prayers, purses, and paynes, knowing that nothing hath befallen them, that we are not subject unto, a sancti∣fied use whereof both to them and us, is the earnest prayer of your loving friend. Northampton, June 9. 1645. IT is said that Langdale did quarrell at Leicester, that the King did not advance North, as hee had promised him and others, and the King promised him within 15 dayes to go that way, else he and other Northerne men would have left hi service. FINIS.
