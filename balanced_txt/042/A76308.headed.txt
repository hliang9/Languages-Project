THE UNIVERSAL CHARACTER, By which all the Nations in the World may understand one anothers Conceptions, Reading out of one Common Writing their own Mother Tongues. AN INVENTION Of GENERAL Use, The Practise whereof may be Attai∣ned in two Hours space, Observing the GRAMMATICAL Directions. Which CHARACTER is so contri∣ved, that it may be Spoken as well as Written. By Cave Beck, M. A. LONDON, Printed by Tho. Maxey, for William Weekley, and and are to be sould at his Shop in Ipswich. 1657.
The Mind of the FRONTISPIECE. MEN to this lower world four parts assign, Since Neptune's Trident, purchas'd a fourth Tin All by their Representatives here meet, And by dumb Signes, each other kindly greet. Europe Elected Speaker, takes the Chair, Laws of one common Voice enacted are. May your next Vote be, Let us Sion build, Sion, that now lies like a plowed field. For when you Babels Tower reare in vaine, God builds a Babel in your lips again. E. K.

To his Friend the Authour Of the UNIVERSAL CHARACTER, Ʋpon his design. BUt can it be? then let no envious breath, So rare a project Criticise to death; Then let the world, with common votes decree, That this for common good Enacted be: This is no Empsons project to ingross, Trading for private gain, and publick loss; No gain for Publicans from hence, nor feare We should of Dutch, or Spanish Plantiffs here. This a design that sets forth like the Sun, For universal good, its course to run; Here Logarithmes, 'yond what Napier findes, That teach by Figures to Uncypher minds, And make our hands officious to help out, Of tongues confusion, made at Babels rout. Now minds may quit their self-disguising dress, Of French, Dutch, Spanish, for a free converse, While hands speak for our tongues: But ah! my friend Will ovr divisions agree t' attend, Alas, confounded in our selves, we hate,
We love, we cherish, excommunicate Divisions, and all divided be, 'Bout all that should reduce to unitie; Were I a Poet (Poets wonders do) I might from stories make a charm or two, To ope mens ears attention to engage, To this thy project by a fair presage. A King of Egypt once, to make conclusion, Which was the Common tongue, 'fore tongues Confusion, Put children to a Goat to Nurse, then tried What they could speak, Beck, Beck, they only cryed, As if they meant to say, it was but vain To try what was; but to retrive again One common speech should be thy work O Beck, Say Poets did they not this work fore-speak? When non-sense Babel-building spoyl'd they say, Each builder ran t' his sack in which his pay, His garlick and his utensils did lie, They though confounded yet united cry, Give me my Sack since when Sack is the name, Alone that in all tongues remains the same, A common pawn to give us hope to see, When common thoughts of private gain, might be A means to help us senses to unite Into one tongue, again at least to write The same; that divers Languages no longer may, Upon our trading such Embargoes lay, Sure if the world do but its profit mind, (Twere strange it should not) thou successe wilt find How ere it prove, an honourable fall, From rare attempts, leaves nobl'st scars of all. Nath. Smart. M. A.
To my intimate and ingenious Friend, Mr. BECK, upon his UNIVERSAL CHARACTER, serving for all Languages. SPeech is the Index of the mind: Loe, here Th' Index of Speech; the dumb Interpreter; The Iliads in a Nut-shell; Tongues in Brief; Babel revers'd; The traveller's Relief; Ferry of Nations Commerce; here you may Passe known, to all the unknown parts.— Away, Post me this letter to some Spanish Don, To th' Cham, or Seignour, or to Prester-John; They all now know my Sense, or her's the key: The Chart of Dialects, right Cosmo-graphie. The Heavenly Orbs and we commune just so, We all their matters by Learn'd Figures know. Great Bacon's Soul, my Friend, divides with thee, He found the Plat, and Thou the Husbandrie. More there have talk'd on't too. So I hear say Of the North passage. But who cuts the way? Nature, that fram'd so rare an one of thee, Thought thee most fit for this Epitome: The Galaxie of Languages; where pack A thousand lights of words, all in one track. Mithridate with-the-score-of tongues, recall Thy pains, and praise; now here is one and all. 'Twere strange if this Prophetick year, wch brought [1656] Such Expectation, should have nothing wrought:
Now see another Deluge come, and then The world, as was of old, new-fac'd agen; Languages swallow'd up, the Ark a flote, Carrying within't something of every note. Launch forth my Friend. But stay, make a short stop, Let me be dead before this see the Shop, Should thy plot take, my Beck, I fear henceforth, To loose my Library as nothing worth. Jos. Waite, M. A.
To the READER. THis last Century of years, much hath been the dis∣course and expectation of learned men, concerning the find∣ing out of an Universal Character, which if happily contrived, soas to avoid all Equivocal words, A∣nomalous variations, and super∣fluous Synonomas (with which all Languages are encumbred, and rendred difficult to the learner) would much advantage mankind in their civil commerce, and be a singular means of propagating all sorts of Learning and true Religi∣on
in the world: Such a Cha∣racter being to be Learned in as few weeks, as the Latin tongue usually requireth years to be per∣fect in, which is the only Langu∣age many ages have in vain labou∣red to make common, but hath proved attainable to few, save such as have dedicated a great part of their lives to the study of it. For the remedy of which evil, the Invention of some easie Cha∣racter hath been judged necessa∣ry, which might be as a Clew to direct us out of this Laborinth of Languages. And Invitations have been made to such an Enqui∣ry from theFiccius L. Bacon. D. Wilkins Learned, abroad & at home, who have demonstrated the possibility thereof, & the pro∣bability of the worlds ready ac∣ceptance of it; which will forget its old practise, if it refuse any be∣nefit,
though it uses not to be sollicitous of thanking the Au∣thor. The Egyptians of old, had a Sym∣bolical way of writing by Em∣blems, and Pictures, which might be read by other Nations instru∣cted in their Wisdom, but was so hard to learn, and tedious in the practice, that Letters soon justled them out of the world. Besides, most of their Hieroglyphicks were so Catachrestical, (the Picture shewing one thing to the eye, and a quite different sense imposed up∣on it) that they justifi'd the Paint∣er who drew a mishapen Cock upon a Sign-board, and wrote un∣der it, [this is a Bull] That the Chinois have a general Character, which serves them∣selves and their Neighbours, though of different Languages, is affirmed by some that have been
there, and brought home some scraules of it, which are such for their fashion, that an European with his one Eye (which they af∣ford him) would think they shut both theirs (they so much boast of) when they drew the shapes of those Characters; there being no proportion or Method observed in their form, which causes them to spend many years, beginning in their Childhood, in learning of it, and that may be the Reason none of our Travellers have been able to bring away any competent skill in that way of writing. All which inconveniences, I trust, will appear in a great measure, avoy∣ded by the present Character com∣mended to the practise of the world, which will be evident to such as read over the Grammatical directions, the fundamentals whereof, in an Hour or two, may
be perfectly Learned; by obser∣ving whereof (without further study) the Reader may make pre∣sent use of the following Alpha∣betical Dictionary, taking out the Characters of any things or No∣tions, he would expresse, or ex∣pounding to himself any thing written in this Character, and so save the charges of hiring Inter∣preters: Besides, avoyding the danger of being mis-understood, or betrayed by Truch-men, mis∣relating his Expressions to For∣raign Ears. I need not forewarn any from attempting to imprint the Dictio∣nary in his Memory, which were to go about the making of a Rope of Sand. But to expect within a few Months, a small Treatise, in the nature of Comenius's Janua, set forth with the Vulgar Language on one side, and the Character on
the other, by which a child of ten years old, learning five sentences a day, may in four moneths space be perfect in the whole Charact∣er. An elder Industry may dou∣ble the number, and consequent∣ly in half the time be master of it, for it having lesse then five thou∣sand words, they will be compre∣hended in 500 sentences, allowing ten words to a sentence, one with another. It is a Character wil fright no Eye with an unusual shape, there being nothing more generally known among men, all looking upon the figures, and reading them in their own Language, for the uses of Arithmetick, and also, for secret Writing, it is the most common Character whereby men indea∣vour to hide their Conceptions from an intercepting hand. Meditating whereof, it pleased
God to suggest to me, that it might be improved to an Universal use, which thought, hath many years strugled within me, but indeavou∣ring to suppresse it, I have been made somewhat sensible of Da∣vids experience, that the brest is a bad hearth to rake up fire in. I re∣fer the Consideration of these things, to the Judicious, & the suc∣cesse to God, whose Gospel, if by this means it be more propagated in the world, by an oportunity of discovering the Glorious Truths thereof, unto such from whom hitherto it hath been locked, I shall judge this pains of mine happily bestowed.
To his Ingenious Friend upon his Universal Character. YOu have unti'd the Riddle, Sir, and purg'd Those knotty doubts, Curiosity ere urg'd, While by your Art the miracle is brought To us from Pentecost, and we are taught By your Character, that the Tongues which set, Like fire o' th' Speakers, th' Hearers intellect Enkindled too; since thus while what you write In ours, by Parthian, Mede, and Elamite, Is own'd their dialect: nor stick you hear, But nobly you confute too, those severe Censors of English speech, wh' object the want Of Grammer in it, and out do that vaunt Of sweet tongued Sidney, who 'bout to refel That Cavillation, wittily did tell. We that way were repriev'd from Babels Curse, Not learning speech at School, but from the Nurse; But you in this your Art do shew, that we Have Grammer too, and speak it nat'rally Well, should this Age neglect it, loud tongued story, Checking their silence, will ring out your glory. Ben Gifford.
The Scheme of the Art, which is to be lear∣ned by heart after the Grammer is read o∣ver. NOuns are known by the Letters p, q, r, x, set before the Arithmetical figures. Instead of Cases, the Vowels, a, e, i, o, u, are set after the Nouns and Participles, Consonants. The Feminines are known by the Letter f, ad∣ded to the Syllabical Cases. The Vowels a, e, i, beginning a Syllable, and having the Consonants, b, c, d, f, g, l, set af∣ter them, expresse the three Persons of the Pronounes, and the Six Tenses of the Verbs. The Consonants, l & m, prefixed to those Syllables, make the Imperative, and Potential Moods. The Infiitive present being writ with plain figures, without any letter or mark before them, is made the Theme, or Root of all. The Passive Voice is distinguished from the Active, by a line drawn over the head of one of the figures. The Plural Number is known by an [s] set af∣ter the figures. Numbers are distinguished from words writ∣ten with the same figures by a crosse.
Derivative Adverbs, have the letter t, set be∣fore their figures. Whatsoever Syllable begins with s, or t, is a Conjunction, or Syllabical Compositi∣on.
CHAP. I. THe Grammer of this invention hath four parts, Orthography, E∣tymology, Syntaxis, Proso∣dy. Orthography sheweth with what Character every word is to be written, they are ten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 0, with a letter or syllable set before, or behind each word for, distinction of parts of Speech, Cases, Numbers, Genders, Persons, Tenses, Compositions, Con∣junctions, of which the second part of Grammer teacheth. The Points of distinction of words and clauses in a sentence, are the same with those of com∣mon use; viz. comma [,] which in this Art must be put at the end of every word, to prevent the confounding of the figures. The middle of a sentence, if it be long, may be marked with a colon [:] but the end of a sen∣tence must have a full period [.] When a Question is asked, put an Interrogati∣on point after the last word of the Question, thus [?] A point of Admiration is added as a sign of a wonder [!] Also, when two words are drawn together, a
line is put betwixt them, called Hyphen [-] as sin-revenging, grace-confirming. A Parenthesi is used when any words are put between the parts of a sentence, thus mark∣ed () CHAP. II. ETymology teacheth the differences of the parts of speech and the forming of them. There are seven parts of speech: Noune, Pro∣nonn, Verbe, Participle. Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition. Note, we reckon the Interjections among the Adverbs, as doe the Greek Grammari∣ans. A Noun is a word, signifying a thing without difference of time, as life, sweet. Note, whatsoever word in our English tongue hath the particle [a or the,] before it is a Noune, as [a man] the house:] a Noun is either a Sub∣stantive, or an Adjective. A Noun Substantive, is that which of it self is sufficient to expresse its signification, without the addition of another word, as [man, strength.] A Substantive is either Proper, or Com∣mon. Note, all proper Names of Men, Countries, Cities, Rivers, &c. found and signifie very like to all Nations, they may be writ in the usual letters, so that we need not devise Characters for them,
but common Nounes have in most Languages as many several Appellations, as there are several Languages in the world, to remedy which con¦fusion this Character is invented. An Adjective is that which requireth a Substantive to be joyned with it, to shew its sig∣nification, as when we say (white) we must add or understand (milk or snow) or some other Sub∣stantive. Nouns have two numbers, the singular which signifies one, as a book, and the plural which sig∣nifies more then one as (books). There are two Genders. the Masculine, and the Feminine, the Masculine as [a man] the Fe∣minin as [a woman] living substances, only di∣dinguish Gender. Other Nouns both abstract, and Concrete, as (coldnesse cold) need no distinction of Gen∣der. Observe diligently several sorts of Nounes, by the letters which distinguish them as follow∣eth. p. Noun Subst. personal male p 3, a man a∣bater, or he that abateth, personal female. p f p f 3 a woman abater, or she that abat∣eth. r Noun Subst. real as r 3, an abatement 3. x Substantive, Active, as (x 3) an abating, or the action of abating, which is more plain in the words (arming the Active Substantive) and armes the Real Substantive, the one signifies the action of arming, and the other the Weapons themselves.
q A Noun Adjective hath a (q) set before its Character, as q 317 bold. There is one declension, or manner of declin∣ing of Nouns, which indeed are all Aptotes, and vary not their Character, but have the five vow∣els instead of Cases set after their Characteristica letter. Singulariter Nominative an Abater. p. 3. Genitive (of) an Abater p a 3. Dative to an Abater p e 3. Accusative (a or the) Abater p i 3. Vocative (o) Abater p o 3. Ablative (from an) Abater p u 3. The Femi∣nins add f, to the vow∣els, as Nom. pf 3 Gen. paf 3 Dat. pef 3 &c.Pluraliter Nominative, the Abaters p 3 s. Genitive, of the Abaters p a 3 s. Dative, to the Abaters p e 3 s. Accusative, the Abaters p i 3 s. Vocative (o) Abaters p o 3 s. Ablative, from the Abaters p u 3 s. Note, that the letter s, set behind the Chara∣cter, is a token of the plural number. Note, the Nominative and the Accusative Case, differ not in signification, only the Nomi∣native is set before the Verb, and the Accusative after it. But if the Nominative be put after the Verb, it will serve as well, (as in the Latine and Greek Nouns, the Nominative and Accusative are often alike.) Note, the signs, or prepositions, in, with, through, by, &c. have several marks which must be taken out of the fift Chapter of Compositions,
and set to the Nouns and Verbs in compositi∣on. Note it is unnecessary to vary Adjectives, by Case, or Gender, as our English tongue doth not, and the Latine and Greek in many Ap∣totes. It is therefore convenient that the sign of the Case be prefixed to the Substantive, & that the adjective be put after the substantive; but such as are curious may decline them like Substantives, adding the vowels to their letter. Nouns are capable of degrees of comparison, as q 317 Bold. Comparative, q q 317 Bolder, or more bold. Superlative, q q q 317, Boldest, or most bold. All numbers are written with their usual Cha∣racters, only that they may be known from the words written with the like figures, a cross must be set above, under, before, or behind the fi∣gure, as 3 plain, signifies to abate. The Substantive numeral Cardinal, a tray (as ternio) r 3+. The Adjective Cardinal three q 3+ The Adverb Cardinal thrice t 3+ Appertaining or belonging to three as tertian. tuc 3+. The Adjective ordinal, third + 3 The Adverb ordinal, thirdly t + 3 The Distributive, three by three 3 + Compounded with fold, as threefold or treble. +3 The Character of Arithmetical Fractions are retained.
CHAP. III. Of a Pronoun. A Pronoun is a part of Speech, used in shew∣ing or rehearsing. The Pronouns being very few, but of most frequent use, are all set down hear: The prin∣cipal, are the three Primitive Persons, I, thou, or you, and he, which are expressed by the Vowels, a, e, i. and these Pronoun Vowels set before the letters they are compounded with, which in Verbs and Participles are, b, c, d, f, g, l. For when the Vowels are put after the letters p, q, r, x, they signifie the Cases of several sorts of Nouns, as was taught in the former Chapter. Pronouns are declined just like the Nouns. Pronouns have no Vocatives, but thou, and my, and our.Singulariter Nominative, I a Gen. of me p a a Dat. to me p e a Accus me p i a Ablat. from me p u a Pluraliter Nominative, we a s Gen. of us p a a s Dat. to us p e a s Accus. us p i a s Ablat. from us p u a s And so is e, and i, declined, &c. The Derivative Pronouns are distinguished from their Primitives by an (h) set before them,
in composition with Nouns: They are thus written, My, or mine Abatement, har 3. Thy Abatement, her 3. His Abatement, hir 3. whose Plurals are Our, Your, Their, as our Abatement hars 3 your Abatement, hers 3 their Abate∣ment, hirs 3. Demonstrative Pronouns are (This, and That, or It, and Self, or Same) which are thus writ∣ten. Sing. This Abatement, hor 3. Plu. These Abatements hor 3 s, which is sometimes called [it] as huac 3 I abated it. There is also that Personal, as hup 3 That aba∣ter, and [This] personal as hop 3. This Abater. When a word is compounded with [self, or same] as I my self, the same man] it must have the letter z set to it as a z I my self. The Relative [which or who, and what the Interrogative,] is known by the Consonant [v] set after the Pronoun, it relates unto as [av I which.] The Relative is thus declined, Nominative, which v. Gen. whose, or of whom va. Dat. to which, or to whom ve. Accus. which, or whom vi. Ablat. from which or whom vu. Note, some times [That] signifies [which] as (he that loveth, or which loveth) and then it hath the same Character. But sometime [that] is a Conjunction, as [speak that I may hear] for whose Character consult the Dictionary.
Note, When [soever] is compounded with a Relative, then the v may be doubled (as in La∣tin quisquis) whosoever. [w] CHAP. IV. Of a Verb and Participle. A Verb is a part of Speech which signifies to do, to suffer, or to be. It hath two Voi∣ces the Active and the Passive; whatsoever sig∣nifies to do, is called Active, [as to beat] that which denoteth suffering, is called Passive, as [to be beaten.] Note, Verbs Neuter, as [to Be] set alone, are declined like the Active, which Verb [Be] in our English tongue prefixt to Participles, form∣eth the Passive Verbs, as I am beaten, I was beat∣en, I shall be beaten, &c. All Verbs have one General Conjugation in both voices, and four Moods, and six Tenses or Times. The Indicative Mood affirms or denies any a∣ction, or passion, as [I abate.] The Imperative Mood commands, intreats, or exhorts as [abate thou.] The Potential Mood hath these signs, may, can, might, could, would, or should, set before the Verb, as [I may abate.] The Infinitive Mood signifies to do or suffer, without any difference of Number or Person, and therefore is written with plain figures, and in
this Art is made the root from whence all the o∣ther words are derived, as [to abate 3.] The Tenses of Verbs follow. b The Presentense, as I abate or do abate ab3. c Imperfect Tense, I abated or did abate ac 3. d Preterperfect Tense, I have abated, ad 3. f Pluperfect Tense, I had abated, af 3. g 1st.

Presen Tense, to be abated 3̄ Preterperfect, to have been abated 3̄d Future, to be abated hereafter 3̄g Note, instead of Impersonals in English, the pronoun [it] is before Verbs, as [it pleased God]
their Character is hu before the Tenses Chara∣cteristical letters, as hub 3 it abateth. Note, Verbs are capable of being compared, as the Nouns were, by doubling and trebling their Tenses Characteristical letter, as Present Positive b 3 abateth   Compositive bb 3 more abateth   Superlative bbb 3 most abateth. And so for all other Tenses. A Participle is a part of speech, partaking of the nature both of a Noun, and a Verb; from a Noun it borrows Gender and Case, from a Verb Tense and signification. There are six Participles, three of the Active, and three of the Passive signification. The A∣ctive are these; Participle of the present Tense, abating, boi 3̄ Participle of the perfect Tense, he which hath abated, doi 3 Future Tense, about to abate, or he that will abate, goi 3 Passive. Participle of the present Tense, aba∣ted, or he that is abated, boi 3̄ Preterperfect Tense, he which hath been aba∣ted, doi 3̄ Future, to be abated hereafter, or he which will be abated, goi 3 Note. the Participles may at pleasure be made of any Tense of the Indicative, or Potential Mood.

Of Adverbs, Conjunctions, and Preposi∣tions. AN Adverb is a part of speech, joyned to Verbs or Nouns (whence some call them Adnouns) to qualifie their signification, as [I justly punish, wilfully blind.] Adverbs are known by the letter r, set before their Character, as t 3 abatingly Most derivative Adverbs in English, end in ly as [wisely, foolishly.] They may be compared by doubling, and tre∣bling their letters, as t 3 tt 3 ttt 3. A Conjunction, is a part of speech, joyning words and sentences together, as [and, if,] they are few, but of frequent use, and therefore they are expressed by Monosyllables set before the words they couple with, are to be found in the
Dictionary, and in the last leaf of the Book they are set all together. A Preposition is a part of speech, set before other parts, as [for, against, with,] and because the Latin Prepositions are in common use in most Vulgar Languages, by reason of many words borrowed from the Latin, as [Postscript, Subscribe, &c.] therefore we have retained such of these Prepositions as are generally known, yet for the help of the Vulgar, their sig∣nification in English is set before them in an AL∣PHABETICAL Order.

sign of the Dative Case, of real substantives. All other prepositions should be set befor the word they compound. On, or upon super (on this side) cis on the other side, trans (To) the sign of the Dative Case. (To) before a Verb, is a sign of the Infinitive Mood present.

Factive, or Causative—(nu) as nu 3 to make or cause to abate. For other Compositions, look the last leaf of the Book. CHAP. VI. Of Syntaxe. SYntaxe is the joyning together of two, or more words in a sentence, and this is either Concord, or Government. There are three Concords, the first, between the Nominative Case and the Verb; the second, be∣tween the Substantive and the Adjective; and the third between the Antecedent and the Rela∣tive (which,) and that when it signifies which, whose, and whom. To know all which, note, when you have a Verb Adjective or Relative, ask the question who, or whom, what? and the word answe∣ring to the question, in that sentence and propo∣sition, shall be the Nominative to the Verb, the Substantive to the Adjective, and the Antece∣dent to the Relative, as in this Example; (I love the Great God which made me: If the
question be asked, who loveth? the answer is, I, and that gives the Nominative Case to the Verb. Secondly, if the Substantive to great be de∣manded, the Answer is, God; And Thirdly, the answer to the Question, who made me? shews the Antecedent to the Rela∣tive which. Note, Howsoever the words in a Sentence be placed for Elegancy, or the Idiom of any Lan∣guage, they must be reduced to a plain Gram∣matical order, that their Syntax or constructi∣on may be known. And therefore it is advised such as practise this Character, would write plain and orderly, according to the directions. Note, Nouns and Verbs being indeed Ap∣totes, affix the signs to them as hath been taught, and there can be no mistake in this writ∣ing. If two, or more Nouns come together, belong∣ing to one thing, the latter is put in the same Case with the former, (as Jesus Christ, the Lord our Righteousnesse; here Christ, and Lord, and Righteousnesse, are all the Nominative Case, by Apposition to Jesus. Note, In the English Tongue an 's put to the Singular Nunber, is a sign of the Genitivc Case set before the word that governs it, as (my Fa∣thers Friend) is Equipollent to the Friend of my Father.) Note, The sign of the Tense, by the English, is sometime set before the Nominative Case to the Verb, especially in Questions, as (doth your Father live?) shall I abate?) let me abate; but
in this Character the sign of the Tense must be alway set to the Verb; as al 3? shall I abate? lab 3 let mc abate. CHAP. VII. Of Prosody. PRosody teacheth how to speak and pro∣nounce this Character, for which purpose one Common Name must be given to each fi∣gure, and those are Ten Monosyllables borrow∣ed from the English names of the figures, which are thus to be pronounced. on,1, too,2, or[to]tre,3, for,4, or[fo]fi,5, sic,6, [and in the Plural Number 6s six.] sen,7, at,8, nin,9, o.0. Note, When the Consonants prefix'd to the figures, are set alone without Vowels to spell them with, they are thus to be pronounced; bee, cee, dee, fee, gee, lee, mee, nee, pee, qee, ar, soi, tee, vau, wee, xee. Note, when two Vowels happen together, which must be pronounced as two Syllables, Grammarians set two pricks over their heads, which they call Diaeresis, as [pii him.] Note, the Vowels (to prevent forreigners
mistake, who pronounce them differently from us) must be thus pronounced a, as [man,] e, as [the,] i, ending a syllable, as [35 trefi] to be pronounced as the word [eye.] i, before a Consonant is short, as (lip) O, ending a word, as [Crow] 34 trefo, o before a Conso∣nant, sounds short, as [upon,] 12, onto, u, as [under.] The Dipthong oi, to be pronounc'd as [boy.] The Passive mark of figures, as ab 3̄, must be pronounced, ab lintre. For the Accent, or syllable to be raised in each word, observe. First, If a word be of two syllables, the Ac∣cent is in the first, as 34 tréfo. Second, If the word be a Polysyllable, the Ac∣cent must be in the Antepenultima or last sylla∣ble but two, (if the Penultima, or last but one have a Vowel next after it) as 3481, trefóraton, but if the Penultima have two Consonants fol∣lowing it, the Accent must be on it as 3812 tre∣atónto. For other Polysyllables liberty may be taken of pronouncing them, as shall seem most pleasant to the ear, as 347 may be pronounced tréfosen, or trefósen. Numerals crosse must be called Cruce, as 3̄ the cruce tree. Note this Character thus pronounced, will sound like Greek, having divers of its sweetest Cadencies, and is capable of Rhetorical, and Po∣etical figures. Look an example of writing and speaking the first Commandement, at the end of the Book.
Take notice that the Grammer and Dictionary is already Translated into the French Tongue, for the use of that Nation, other Languages will be hastned. If any forreigners, shall please to Publish this Character in their own Countries, in their Na∣tive Tongues, I desire the same course may be taken, which we have observed in the French; viz. That a double Index be made, one of the Figures in their order set before the words, and another of the words placed Alphabetically be∣fore the Character. And that care be taken no alteration be made of the Figures. And what additions shall be judged necessary of words omitted in this Edi∣tion, that they be propounded to publick debate, whether necessary or no, and being Demonstra∣ted to be such, they may be taken in by publick Consent in after Editions. Note, If you would find any derived word in the Dictionary, which you will know by putting [to before it, as [sodden,] cometh from to seeth and by the Grammatical directions supply marks of Derivation. Note, The same Character is applyed to most words of the same signification, and therefore when the order of figures seems disturbed in the Dictionary, know, those figures were set before or after to some word of the same sense: And that they may be the better distinguished, those repea∣ted figures are of a lesser size then the other. Note, Not only proper names need no Cha∣racter, (as was observed before) but also many
Apellatives, Terms of Art, as [Antithesis,] officine Medicines, as [Mithredate] and Di∣vers Plants and Animals, as Arecca, Bonasus &c. have but one name in most Languages, and therefore we have spared annexing Characters to them.
