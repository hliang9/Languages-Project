THE BLACK BOX OF ROME OR, A True and short Discourse, shewing the blasphemous Treacheries and Conju∣rations of the wicked Iesuites, when they in∣tend and encourage any of their impious Disci∣ples to murther a King, and overthrow a Kingdome. Printed in the Yeare, 1641.
THE IESUITES BLASPHEMOVS CON∣IVRATIONS TO ENCOV∣rage their Proselytes to King-killing-treacheries. SUch is the most bloudy, and most blasphemous impudencie of these Romish Incendiaries, that when they put on a divellish and despe∣rate resolution, to murther any Em∣perour, King, or Prince whom they have once pronounced to be an Hereticke, and ex∣communicate person; and thereupon intend to mur∣ther him by some Raviliack, whom they make choice of for the execution of the said Treason; that after such an unfortunate and wretched person, is once allured, and entred into their place of consul∣tation, or
chamber of (Philonicall) prayers, (for  sooth) as they call them: These infernall firebrands kneele all downe, who in their prayers observe their time; and put before the intended Traitor, a knife folded up in a scarfe; shut up in a little Box, covered with an Agnus Dei; written about with black letters of perfumes, odorifirous Characters: and when they draw it out themselves, they cast or sprinckle some drops of holy water upon it, and which done, they hang at the hafte of the said knife, five or six graines of Corrall, which are blessed by them, who blaspheamously they give him to understand, and make him beleeve that so many blowes, as shall be given by him with the said knife; so many soules shall be released out of Purgatorie. Afterwards, putting the knife into the intended Murtherers hand, they pronounce these words say∣ing: Goe now like Iephte, with the Sword of Sampson in thy hand, the Sword with which David did cut off Golia's head, the Sword of Gedion; yea, the Sword with which Iudith did cut off Holophernes head, the sword of the valiant Machabees, and the same with which Saint Peter did cut off Malcas his eare, yea I say, the sword of Pope Iulius the second, with the which (breaking the forces of oppugning Princes) he tooke out of their hands with great effusion of blood, the Citties of Sezza, Imola, Fayance, Bolog∣na, and many other Cities: goe thus I say, thou magnanimous Champion of the chaire of Rome, and be valiant, and God strengthen thine arme for the great worke now intended by thee. After which, this infernall kennell
of Romish blood-hounds  kneele all downe, and the most wretchedly renowned and cursedly quallified amongst them, with a caute∣rized conscience and immarbled heart, pronounceth the bloody Conjuration, impiously and impudently saying as followeth. Come Cherabims, come Seraphinns, and highest Thrones that rule, come blessed Angels: yea, bles∣sed Angels of charitie, come and fill this holy Vessel with glory and eternity, and bring him presently the Crowne of the Virgin Mary, of the Patriarches, and of the Martirs, for he belongeth no longer to us, but to you. And thou Oh dreadfull and terrible God, who hast revealed to him in these our Prayers and medi∣tations; that he ought to murther a Tyrant, and con∣found a Hereticke, and to give the Crowne to a Ca∣tholike-King. And being by us disposed to this me∣ritorious Murther, vouchsafe to fortifie his senses, and increase his forces: to the end that he may ac∣complish this thy great will; and vouchsafe to arme and furnish him with the Harnesse of thy powerfull providence, that he may valiantly performe the wor∣thy worke he hath piously undertaken, and may hap∣pily escape from those, who would apprehend him: give him Eagles winges, that the spight and malice of those Barbarians whom hee goes against, may not once touch his sanctified members. Extend also the beames of thy joy and coelestiall felicitie upon his sacred soule, to the end that by the blessed influence thereof, the parts and members of his body also; may be encouraged and enabled to this great worke, and that it may chearefully dispose
it selfe to this ho∣ly  Combate without feare or shrinking pusillanimi∣ty. This accursed Conjuration being thus audacious∣ly and gracelessely uttered, they carry the thus in∣chanted bloody Regicide, and set him before an Al∣tar, where they shew him a Picture wherein the an∣gels are seene and showne to have lifted up and ele∣vated long since Iames Clement, a bloody Iacobine Fryer, and represented him (as it were) before the Throne of God, saying: Lord behold thy Pupill, behold thy well-instru∣cted Champion, and the accomplisher of thy justice: Whereupon all the Saints rise out of their seates to make him roome, and give him place among them. And when all these things are thus done and finish∣ed, there are no more but foure Iesuites only left with him, who when they come neare him; they with diabolicall impudencie and lying flatterie, say unto him: that they seeme to perceive that there is some Diety infused into him, and that they are so a∣stonished with the radiant light-shining and gliste∣ring in him, that they hold it their honour to kisse his hands and feete, and make him madly to beleive that they account him not a meere man any longer; but that they esteeme themselves (as it were) as they say, halfe unworthy of the happinesse and glo∣ry which hee hath already obtained by his Catho∣licke resolution, and sighting deepely before him: they say unto him; we would that God had chosen us, and called us to your estate: since we should be truly assured, that we should goe really, and direct∣ly into
Paradice without comming at Purgatorie.  And thus having intoxicated and bewitched the miserable wretch, they thus leave him to his inten∣ded bloody designe. The end of the Conjuration. FINIS. O Lord preserve our Noble King Charles, and all his posteritie, from the power of all such Romish regicides and bloody Traitors, who thus plot and practice to build up their Romish Syna∣gogue with blood. And grant good God, that our gracious King Charles, may with his posterity, long continue a happie and prosperous raigne over this Kingdome, for the maintenance and propaga∣tion of Christs Gospell in despight of Antichrist, and all his bold and bloody adherents: and let eve∣ry good, and loyall subject and true hearted English Christian say, Amen, and Amen.
