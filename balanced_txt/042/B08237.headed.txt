SIR, SInce you importune me so much to give my Thoughts why the Parliament was Prorogued, I will be pre∣vailed with to tell you, that perhaps Commissary Shales would have been in Town in a short time; and that though it was Impossible for the King to tell who recom∣mended him, he would have told that and somewhat more, rather than undergo the Displeasure of the House of Com∣mons: But besides, I wonder, his Majesty could so long in∣dure their Siting after they began to think the People had Rights and Priviledges, and that it would be no inconveniency to let them have some share in chusing the Officers of the Militia, and when they were going on to except such sort of Tools of the last Reigns, as may be useful Instruments now to screw up the Prerogative as soon as Foreigners; enough are brought in to back the Design. But yet farther, there is a secret murmuring, that some Members of the House of Com∣mons had the Impudence to think of acquainting the King, by an Address, what sort of Ministers were fit to be remov'd, that they intended to reap up old Stories, and represent those Noble Peers the Marquisses of Carmarthen, Hallifax, the Earl of Nottingham, and my Lord Godolphin, with the Miseries that we underwent when they sate at the Helm: When in my Conscience there can't be picked out in these Three Kingdoms Men itter for his Majesty's purposes, Men that will do the Monarchy more right, or be truer to their own In∣terest▪ To Conclude, I know no great need a Wise Prince can have of a Parliament, but raising of Money; and I think as much is given as the Nation will willingly pay. And, I hope, I have sufficiently vindicated his Majesty's Royal Wis∣dom in this Prorogation.
