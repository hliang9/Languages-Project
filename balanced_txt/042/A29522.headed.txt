A BREVIATE OF Saving Knowledge, OR The Principles of Christian Reli∣gion methodically digested into short Questions and Answers. Purposely composed and published, for the use and benefit of such as have good desires, but weake memories. By I. B. Prov. 19. 2. that the soule be without knowledge, it is not good. Eccles. 12 9. The more wise the Preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge. Psal. 34.11. Come children hearken unto me, and I will teach you the feare of the Lord. 1 Cor. 3.2.

To all that desire to be in∣structed in the Truth which is according to Godlinesse. IT is not scarcity of Catechismes that hath brought this Tract to light; nor yet the novelty either of the matter, or ex∣pressions therein conteyned. Both these, for the most part, you may happily meete with elsewhere, scattered in Treatises of like na∣ture. That which commends it unto your purusall, is the brevity and perspicuity of it. Both these I have purposely affected, having therein a speciall regard to the capacities and memories of Children, whether in age or knowledge. For their sakes, proceeding in a methodicall way, I have contracted both Questions and Answers, into as few words as conveniently I could, that so both
might be the more portable. Hereof, who so shall please to make use, committing these few leaves to head and heart, comparing the Proofes with the Text, I doubt not but in a short time (through the blessing of God) he may come to be a good proficient in that most excellent and necessary knowledge, the knowledge of God and Iesus Christ; which unfainedly wishing to all, specially to those of my owne charge, for whose sake at the first this Manuall was composed, I rest, Yours and the Churches JOHN BRINSLEY.
