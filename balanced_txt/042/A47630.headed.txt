A TREATISE OF Religion & Learning, AND OF Religious and Learned men. Consisting of six BOOKS. The two first treating of RELIGION & LEARNING. The four last of RELIGIOUS or LEARNED MEN In an Alphabetical Order. A Work seasonable for these times, wherein RELIGION and LEARNING have so many Enemies. By EDWARD LEIGH Master of Arts of Magdalen-Hall in Oxford. PROV. 9.10. Solus homo sapientia instructus est, ut Religionem solus intelligat, & haec est hominis, atque mutorum vel praecipua, vel sola distantia. Lactant. Lib. De Ira Dei. LONDON, Printed by A.

TO THE Right Reverend JAMES USHER Arch-Bishop of Armagh. HONOURED SIR, BOth the Subject I handle, and my own special Obligation are a just Apologie for my Dedication of this Treatise unto you. I treat of Religion and Learning, a no∣ble Argument, and (were it an∣swerably handled) well-worthy of so noble a Patro∣nage. Learning is the great Ornament of a man, and true Religion (which is an honouring of God suitably to his Excellency) is the great Ornament of a Christian. Where there is a happy conjunction of a learned Head, and a sincere and truly religious Heart, there is a Person every way accomplisht. Bi∣shop Juell is frequently for this reason styled, The Jewell of Bishops; and of Dr Raynolds it is said, Incertum est fuerit doctior an melior.
Dr Rivet and Peter du Moulin, two French Divines are famous for their eminent Piety, learned Writings, and fifty years preaching. Your Name is also precious in all the Reformed Churches, witness the Dedication of divers learned De Dieu in Acta Apost. Spanem. Dub. Evang. parte 2da. Bootii Ani∣madver. Sac. Mori Cal∣vinus. Cartw in Exod. Treatises to you, and the honourable mention which many learned men frequently Reveren∣distimus an∣tistes. Iaco∣bus Vsserius Archie pis∣copus Ar∣machanus, vir summa pietate, ju∣dicio singu∣lari, usque ad miraculum doctus, & literis seve∣rioribus promoven∣dis natus Seldnus in Praefat. ad Marinora Arundelia∣na. make of you One thing I shall desire to specifie, which I look upon as one of your great Ac∣complishments, your humble and affable Disposition, both in a free admission of the very meanest; and al∣so in a ready communicating of your self unto them, which noble quality being in you when you were at the highest (as I have heard) is therefore the more commendable. Your sending to Samaria for several Copies of the Samaritane Pentateuch, bringing them first into Europe, and dispersing them many wayes, and also your purchasing at a dear rate the Syriack-Bible, and many other Syriack-Books from Syria, and your free imparting them to such Schollers as were skilfull in that Language, is deser∣vedly celebrated by Mr Selden in his Preface ad Marmora Arundeliana, De Dieu in his Epi∣stle Dedicatory to the Acts, and Dr Boot in his index Autorum before his Animadversiones Sa∣crae.Praesulum decus the Ia∣cobus Arma∣chanus Ga∣tak. Cinnus. c. 5. Your Liberality to such as are in a necessitous condition, is also well known. It is a usual Maxim or Proverb, That the greatest Schollers are not the best Preachers; and Queen Elizabeth was wont to say, That she had made a Bishop, and marr'd a Preacher. You have really confuted both these, by your plain and powerfull Preaching, and by your constant labouring (for above fifty years) in that
sacred Function, even after the time, that through a naturall decay you were unable to reade your Text. Therein well fullfilling your Motto, both in your Episcopall and Archiepiscopall Seal, Vae mihi si non Evangeliza vero. Could your leisure have permitted you to have heard me reade this whole Work to you, as you did vouchsafe me the favour, to hear part of it, it might have been more exact in it self, and so more worthy your Countenance You were pleased to com∣mend to me some of the Authous I made use of, and to supply me also with some choice Books out of your well-furnisht Library; some of the Observations also I was beholding to you for, to you (I say) who are , a breathing Library,Eunapius de Longino in Porphyr. p. 12. and walking Study. This, with what I before alleadged, may justifie this honouring of my Book with your Name, the Dedication of it to you be∣ing as proper, as that of Tullies Book De senectute ad senem; or that of Hermannus Hugo De ori∣gine scribendi ad Scribanium. The Argument also is seasonable for these tims, wherein Learning hath other enemies besides the ignorant, if a Gover∣nour of a Colledge in the Vniversity, may not goe for an Ignaro also; and wherein the vitals of Religion are in so much danger, partly by Scepticisme of the one side, and questioning almost all the great Articles of Christian Faith, and by Libertinisme on the other side, as if the Primitive Christians, Martyrs, and old Puritans, had been more precise then wise. It is your honour therefore in such a declining Age, when others dispute away Truths and Duties, to stand for
Orthodox Truths, and practise holy Duties. Psal. 119.126, 127. Old-age (saith Salomon) is a Crown when it is found in the way of Righteousness. As God hath inriched you with large Abilities, so lay them out still for the good of the Church, that so you may prove a happy instrument whilst you live of Gods Glo∣ry, which is the desire of SIR Your most Affectionate Friend and Servant EDWARD LEIGH.
To the Judicious and Candid READER. READER, WHen I first pitcht my thoughts upon this Subject, I in∣tended only to give some brief Character of some Humanists, and some of the chief reformed Writers, but in the prosecution of my Design, meeting with divers Elogies and apt descriptions of some of the chief Popish Writers, I thought it not amiss to make the Work more general. A learned Divine inquired of me, when my Body of Divinity was coming forth, Whether I treated there of Religion, seeming to wonder, that many who publish∣ed Systemes of Divinity, said nothing of so usefull a Subject, whereabout also many Questions might be raised and discussed. I thereupon bethink∣ing with my self, that I might conveniently treat of it in this Book, accordingly made Religion and Learning the Argument of the two first Books, and those that were eminently Religious or Learned, are mentio∣ned according to the order of the Alphabet in the four following Books. But I take liberty therein by reason of the Alphabetical order, and be∣cause I could not so properly refer them to the second Book, to speak of several Bibles, Councels, Confessions, Proverbs, and the Talmud, in the letter of the Alphabet, whereto they belong, the knowledge thereof being helpfull to Schollers. Besides, where I speak of Charles the Great and the fifth, I also mention Charles the ninth, both because I met with an excellent Character of him in Thuanus, and also because he was a spe∣cial instance of Gods retaliating Justice, for shedding the bloud of Pro∣testants in the Parisian Massacre. I may perhaps also mention an Heretick that was not famous either for Learning or Piety. I thought good to ad∣vertise the Reader hereof, lest he should wonder else when he meets with these particulars. The first Book is concerning Religion, that it is, what it is, its Antiquity, the true and false Religions, the Reformed Religion, and some Questions about Religion are also discussed. The second Book is concerning Learning, its Excellentcy, Usefulness, of the Liberal Arts, the Languages, Universities. In the four last Books, my intention was to speak of such as were Zealous for the true Religion, or eminent for Learning, either as general Schollers, or peculiarly learned in any kinde.
As the Argument is double, Religion and Learning, and the persons double, Religious and Learned, so I should be glad, if it might conduce any way to the advancing of the esteem at least of the true Religion and Learning, to the setling of men in the true Religion, and incouraging of them in all good Literature. You have here a Catalogue of the famous Witnesses of Christ against Antichrist, of the Champions for Truth, the glorious Reformers and blessed Martyrs, to win you to the liking of, and constancy in the true Religion. You have also here a roll of the famous Linguists and Artists, the learned Lawyers, Physicians, Divines, anci∣ent and modern, Protestants and Papists, the learned Poets, Philoso∣phers, Historiographers, Orators, learned men and women, to allure you to a good opinion at least of Learning, as that which is so many wayes usefull both to Civil and Christian societies. I might here expatiate in the just praises of England, for the purity of its Doctrine in Religion, and also for the many learned AuthorsSee Burtons Melancholy. part. 1. Memb. 3 sub Sect. 15.

As the Separation made by our first Reformers was most just for the Idolatry and Cruelty of the Romish Church, Revel. 17.5, 6. not∣withstanding the great  of Schism against us by the Romanists, so the English have since the first Reformation here happily begun in the Reign of that pious Prince Edward the sixth, and sealed with the bloud of many holy Martyrs in the dayes of Queen Mary, maintained and countenanced that pure Religion which may fitly be called their Palla∣dium. England is celebrated abroad by the name of the ringing Island, and it may justly ascribe the great fertility and plenty of outward bles∣sings it enjoyes, to the free entertainment it hath given to the Gospel, and the true Professours of it. But let us take heed of imitating Hol∣land too much in an Universal Toleration of all Religions, shall, I say, or opinions, least what Baudius applies to them, agree too fitly to us, Sed vivimus hic non solum in regno libertatis verum etiam licentiae.

They were wont by way of scorn to call all Transalpines that were not Italians.For learned men, if there were Athenae Anglicae, as there are Athe∣nae Batavae and Belgicae, and as Leland, Balaeus, Godwin of old, so some judicious pen would reckon up the Viri Illustres of later times here in England, I doubt not but there would be a great number of English Heroes.

For the multitude of Divines and Preachers of this Nation, I shall need to say little, it being generally acknowledged, that we here∣in surpasse the rest of the Reformed Churches.

Some may perhaps think it may savour of flattery for me to mention the living amongst the other learned men deceased, Nam vivorum ut magna admiratio, ita censura difficilis est, Paterc. Hist. l. 2. To that I answer, Some of those Latine Authors, which write of il∣lustrious men, speak of divers that were then living. 2. Those that are well acquainted with my temper, will not, I suppose, much charge me with adulation, and the ordinary way of honourably mentioning Authors in quotations little differs from this. I hope what I say in that kinde will incourage and not puff up any. As I may through mistake insert some here, who perhaps were nei∣ther eminent for Religion nor Learning, so I hope no man will imagine that I take upon me to give so compleat an enumeration, as to omit none, that were too difficult a Province for me to undertake, if the most here be such as will agree with the running Title, I hope none will inter∣prete it exclusively, as if these alone were such. I have cause to bless God that this Subject is profitable, as those others I have formerly la∣boured in, and hope, that as they have been generally well-esteemed of (for who can expect to please all?) so this likewise will be favourably entertained by those that are candid and judicious, which is the de∣sire of Thy Affectionate Friend EDWARD LEIGH.

A TREATISE OF RELIGION AND Learning. BOOK 1. OF RELIGION. CHAP. I. Of Religion in general. RELIGION is the chief thing which distinguisheth a man from a beast; the Elephant and some bruits have a shadow of rea∣son, but Religion is peculiar to men, or reasonable creatures at least; therefore Gesner (as I remember) saith, the Pigmies are a kinde of Apes, and not men, because they have no Religion. I shall in the entrance to this Work shew 1. That Religion is. 2. What Religion is. 1. That it is. Some of the Arguments which prove that there is a God, prove also that there is Religion, for Religion gives God that honour and homage that is due unto him. The working of Conscience proves that there is a God, and it also proves a Religion. The knowledge and sense of sinne is in all mens hearts; the Heathens had their turpia & honesta; a great part of Religion lies in a kindly fear of sinne, and the feare of punishment after sinne proves it also, that there is some Religion. 2. The flying to refuge in troubles, and the praying also in straights, Jon. 3.6. is a proof that there is a God, and also that there is a Religion. 3. It hath been the practise of all people ever since the world was, to use some re∣ligious Rites. Abel sacrificed, See Gen. 4. ult. The most ancient Heathen Histories men∣tion their Religion. Plutarch saith, the first care their Lawgivers had; was about their Gods and their Worship. So all Nations acknowledge that there is a God and there∣fore
to be worshipped. Religion is the glory and excellency of Angels, in that they adore him that is better then themselves: it was the excellency of Adam in Pa∣radise, being the effect of the Image of God upon the soul. The Jews were once the only Nation whom God honoured, by intrusting them with his Oracles, Rom. 9.4. compared with c. 3. v. 2. The imbracing, maintaining and practising of the true Re∣ligion, is the onely way to make a Nation or Person strong and peaceable, 2 Chron. 11.16, 17. prosperous and plentifull in all outward blessings, 2 Chron. 11.5, 12. 2 Sam 6.12. For those that honour God he will honour, and those that despise him, shall be lighly esteemed, 1 Sam. 1.30. 2. What Religion is. Of the word.

Institut. moral. l. 9. c. 10.The Hebrew word comes from a verb which signifieth to serve or worship, see James 1. ult: for Religion, the Syriack interpreter hath a word which signifies ser∣vice, worship. Austin and Lactantius derive the Latine word à religando: it is the great bond to tie us to God and to man. Others à reeligendo, or à relegendo, be∣cause by the often reading and choice of holy books Religion is learned. Religion is either true or false. The true Religion is that whereby we serve the true God and with true worship. Romani.False religion is either that, whereby either we serve the false god, as the Romanes in times past, or whereby we serve the true God with false worship, as the present Romanes.Romanenses. Superstitio est, ubi aut falsi dii, aut falso & inani cultu co∣litur Deus: con∣tra religio, ubi verus Deus ve∣roque cultu co∣litur. Impictas verò est, ubi nulia prorsus est religio, & tales homines propriè impii vocantur, qualis fuit Diagoras, qui  dictus est. Zanch. Tom. 4. l. 1. De Reli∣gione, c. 13. Idem sunt rcipsa verus Dei cultus, & vera religio, sicut contra falsus & impius cultus idem est atque supersti∣tio, falsaque religio, Zanch. Tom 4. l. 1. De Religione, c. 13. 1. Religio accipitur pro ratione seu modo colendi Deum, vel pro orma culius exterm & publiti qui Deo exhibetur, sive rectè, sive perperam. 2. Pro virtute qua Deum rectè agnosci∣mus, & sanctè a. purè oblimus juxta normam in verbo Dei praescriptam seu pro interna & sincera animi pietate à qua dicimur religiosi. Raa. esa. Religion may be thus defined. It is an officious action, debt, duty, worship or service, inward and outward, which God requireth and man is bound to perform according to his will, by vertue of that bond whereby he is tied to God. True Religion is the true service of the true God. Morn. de verit. Christ. relig. cap. 24. One saith, True Religion is the right performance of those duties which we owe to the one onely true God.

The Christian Religion is now of some standing. There are resemblances of all the gifts of man in the Beasts, but none of Religion, this is the chiefest perfection of man. Azorius saith, Religion is a Morall and not a Theological vertue, for God is not the object of it, but the honour and worship of God, which Religion gives to the divine Majesty.

Secunda verae Religionis nota est: Quod in ea ola vera ratio explicetur, per quam homo peccator cum Deo reconciliari possir, quam in Christiana sola etiam re∣perire est, quia in illa sola sacrificium peccatis expiandis idoneum, & irae Deiplacandae sufficiens invenitur.

Judaie. and Persians have their service in the Arabick tongue, which the people understand not. The Jews reade in their Synagogues, the Law and the Prophets in the Hebrew tongue, whereas the most part of their people have but little or no understanding thereof. The Papists have the Scriptures and their Liturgie in Latine. 2. False Religion is loose, but the true Religion requires strict and holy walking, James 1.26, 27. Eae Religio praeferenda quae favet puritati & sanctitati vitae. Lessius. Fornication was scarce a sinne among the Heathens; Mahomet was dissolute him∣self, and allowed his Disciples to be sensuall; The Jews practise Usurie; Abominable uncleannesse is permitted and practised at Rome. 3. The Scripture is the only rule to judge of true and false Religions, Deut 13.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Thes. 5.21. 1 Joh. 4.1, 2. The marks of the true Religion laid down by Walaeus are;Animadventen∣dum est primum Decalogi prae∣ceptum unum cole Deum ad Religionem per∣tinere, cujus est justum ac debi∣tum Deo cultum deferre. 1. The true know∣ledge of the true God. 2. A true way of reconciling man with God. 3. True wor∣ship of God. Zanchy layes down these Theses. 1. True Religion (which is the same with piety) consists in the true worship of God, both externall and internall, but especially in the internall. 2. True Religion knowes and worships onely one God, Exod. 20.3. God will have no companion in his majesty and worship. The wisest Philosophers and best Poets among the Gentiles, thought the same; as both Justin Martyr and Clemens Alex∣andrinus, and other Fathers have abundantly demonstrated.Azor. Institut. Moral. l. 9 c. 10. Lactantius one of the most eloquent of the Latine Fa∣thers hath written grave∣ly both of the true and false Religion. 3. The true Religion worships God with no other worship then that which he hath prescribed, viz. with true piety of minde. Externall Rites, Ceremonies, Sacrifices (which also are  worship) in the Scri∣pture, are onely exercises of inward piety, and therefore are so farre acceptable to God as they proceed from inward piety. Christian Religion was planted by the power of God: As it appears, 1. By its speedy propagation, Rom. 1.8. Col. 1.6. 1 Joh. 5.4. 2. All these things were foretold long since by the Sybils and Prophets. 3. From the nature of the Doctrine of Christ, the efficacy of his Doctrine,The Divine authority of the Christian Doctrine con∣firmed. and the authority of the Teacher: What Doctrine did Christ and his Apostles use to per∣swade their hearers? Give to the poor, Give your cheeks to the smiter, Do good to your enemies, Deny your selves, Take up your Crosse, You must look for many afflictions and persecutions if you follow us. O suasionem dissuasionis omnis undique plenam, saith Facinus. Yet Christ perswaded suddenly many and great men; and the reason is given Mark. 1.22. Christ taught with authority, not as the Scribes and Pharisees. 4. From the sublimitie and symphonie Habent scrip∣tores illi nescio, quid pium & Augustum, at∣que id quod mi∣rabile est, inter se quidem com∣mune à caeteris omnibus penitu alienum, quod significat omni∣bus illis Deum prae catrris spa∣rassc. M. Fic. de Rel Christ. c. 8. and certaintie of the books of the old and new Testament. Other Authors doubt and waver. 1 Joh. 1.2, 3. and 5.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 1 Joh. 4.13, 14, 15, 16. 5. The purity of this Doctrine and the amplitude of the Promises. These reasons and more are alledged by Marsilius Ficinus in his 8th and 35 Cha∣ters of his excellent book De religione Christianae. The glory of a Religion lies in three things, 1. The excellency of Rewards. 2. The purity of the Precepts.
3. The sureness of the principles of trust. Let us examine the Christian Religion by these things, and see if it can be match∣ed elsewhere. Neque terrena praemia, ut leges aliae, sed caelestia pollicetur. Ficin. de Relig. Christ. cap 8.1. The reward is the eternall injoyment of God in Christ, Psal. 6.11. 2 Cor. 4.16. Heb. 11.6. 2. The purity of precepts: Our holy Religion doth not only forbid sins, but lusts, Psal. 19.9. 1 Pet. 2.21. The Law of God reacheth not only to the act, but to the aim and intention in duties. The glory of Religion hath been to have holy Martyrs and inamous Persecutors. Justinus Philosophus & Martyr, de conversione sua, transituque ab Ethnicismo verba faciens, ingenue fatetur, se Platonicae sectae addictum, cum Christianos velut de plaustro omni conviciorum genere proscindi, & tamen impavidos omnium aetatum dignitatumque homines ad mortem accedere animadverteret, cogitare caepisse, fieri non posse, ut ejusmodi homines improbi voluptatibus dediti vitae hujus amantes jure habeantur, qui etiam cum dignitate vivendi conditione sibi oblata, mori malunt, quum Christum abnegare. Nullum enim tale praefidium è Platonis Philosophia morti opponi posse, vir prudens & ingeniosus facile colligebat. Jac. Gryn. Epist. l. 1. Epist. 41. Vide plura ibid.3. The sureness of the principles of trust, Psal. 19.7. Psal. 93.5. they are called The sure mercies of David. Heb. 12.28. No other Religion but the Christian shews the way to salvation, nor gives assu∣rance of salvation; nor no people but Christians have assurance. Means to keep us constant in the Truth of Religion. 1. We should ground our selves well in the knowledge of it, 2 Tim. 3.14. Col. 1.23. For which end, 1. Acquaint thy self well with the main principles of Religion, this is the foun∣dation, Heb. 6.1. 2. Receive nothing in Religion upon the credit of any man, Acts 17.11. 1 Thess. 5.21. 2. Love and practise that thou knowest, Psal. 86.11. & 119.3. Luke 8.15. 3. Take heed of declining from, or forsaking the least truth, Psal. 119.127, 128. 4. Be constant in a conscionable use of all Gods holy Ordinances, 1. The Mi∣nistry of the Word, Ephes. 4.14. Heb. 10.23, 25. 2. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is the Sacrament of our nourishing and strengthening in the State of Grace, and Christ therein is received as bread, the use whereof is to strengthen mans heart, Psal. 104.15. 3. Prayer, Psal. 86.16. & 119.117.

Apologet.The Gentiles accused Christians of impiety, because leaving the ancient Reli∣gion (said they) they passed to a new superstition, and forsook the worship of the Gods; whence also they collected, that all the evils which infested men were sent by the angry Gods, nd therefore they ascribed to them the calamities of the world: To whom Tertullian well answered, That many of those calamities upon Cities and Islands happened before Christs coming. Whether men may be saved in any Religion? The Socinians say a man of any perswasion may be saved, if he doth not walk contrary to his light. The Scripture speaks but of one faith, Ephes. 4.5. and that also the Nations should be brought to God by this Gospel, Matth. 24.14. None can be saved with∣out Christ, 1 Cor. 3.11. There is no other foundation of hope and comfort, no other name under heaven, Act. 4.12. I am the way, Joh. 14.6.
CHAP. II. Of the chief False Religions. THere are many false Religions, but the principall are these four. Paganism.Infideles omnes populi appellan∣tur in libris ve∣teris testamenti Goiim, & inde in postolicis li∣bris, & Evan∣gelistarum mo∣numentis  nempe; quia praeter populum Deo peculiarem Iudeae terminis inclusum, & postea praeter paucos fideles, gentes omnes aliae & nationes vero Deo igno∣rato Idolis ser∣viebant. Cum Christiani au∣tem imperatores terrarum orbi praefiderent, & Ecclesiae Christo ubique conde∣rentur; contra Idolorum templa clauderentur & everterentur, simul cum appellationis causa appellatio quoque ipsa mutata est, & pro nationibus, Gentibus, Ethnicis, Pagani appellari caeperunt, qui prope non amplius terrarum orbem occupantes sed in augustum coarctati, & quasi pagis tantum quibusdam conclusi. Nec dubito quin hac vera appellationis ratio fucrit, non quod eruditi homines excogitarint, videntur ea omnia (quod eruditissimorum hominum pace dixerim) à rei veritate paulo longius abesse. Herald. Animadvers. ad Arnob. l 1. p. 3, & 4. Vide Voer. Disput. Theol. part. 2. de Gentilismo. Mahometism. Judaism. Popery. First, Paganism. The Heathen are of Christians called Pagani, because the people who lived in Country Villages (which are properly called Pagani, a Pago, and that of , as Pomp. Festus saith, Quia eadem aqua uterentur) remained for the most part Hea∣thenish, after the Cities generally were converted to Christianity. B. Down. De∣fence of his Sermon, l. 2. ch. 7. The Apostles first preached in great Cities, where Religion by Gods blessing upon their labours did first take place, which was a cause why the name of Pagans (which properly signifieth Country-people) came to be used in common speech for the same that Infidels and unbelievers were. There is Infidelitas negativa, or purae negationis, as in Pagans and Turks, to whom God never yet vouchsafed the means of grace. 2. Pravae dispositionis, by which one refuseth to believe, Isa. 7.9. 2 Thess. 2.10. The condition of the Pagans or Heathens is excellently described, Ephes. 2.12. At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. The Scripture still brands the Heathens, Jer. 10.25. Matth. 6.32. 1 Pet. 4.3. the Heathens and Publicans are joyned together. They knew that there was a God, Rom. 1.18, 19. & 2.14. and the wisest of them worshipped the true God, Act. 17.23. but 1.Non est quaestio de gentilibus ad Ecclesiam Isra∣eliticam congre∣gratis, an illi sa∣lutis participes facti fuerint, sed de gentilibus ex∣tra Ecclesiam. 2. Non est quae∣stio de notitia naturali, qualis fuit in primo homine ante lapsum, sed de notitia naturali, qualis est in hominibus post lapsum, extra verbi revelationem, an per illam gentiles luce verbi & cognitione Christi destituti salutem con∣sequi potuerunt. Gerh. Confess. Cathol. lib. 2. Special. rtic. 2. c. 4. Vide plura ibid. Their knowledge was imper∣fect and confused. 2. Languishing and fainting, mixed with many doubts, Ari∣stotle and Plato the wisest of them doubted about God, and the immortality of the soul. 3. They had no knowledge of Christ and the Trinity of persons. No man can come to the Father but by me, he is called the Way, Joh. 5.23. & 17.3. 1 John 2, 23. & 5.11, 12. Act. 4.12. Secondly, For their life and conversation, they had no true piety in them. 1. Because they had not faith, which only purifieth the heart, Rom. 10.17. 2. They were not renewed or converted, every one must be regenerated, a new creature. 3. They had not a right end in what they did. 4. All their morality was defiled with idolatry, Rom. 1.23, 25. They became vain in their imaginations, v. 21. The Stoicks were the strictest Sect of all the Philosophers, yet there was a great difference between their discipline and the discipline of Christians; they command∣ed to give to the needy, but forbad to be moved with pity, because pity is a passi∣on which a wise man should be free from: but that is a strange wisdom which
takes away all humanity, that is Philanthropy, b which name the Grecians call pity. Therefore their state before the Gospel cometh to them, must needs be wofull and damnable. Lucretius Carus the Philosopher and Poet, inveighing sore against the super∣stitious Religion of the Gentiles, and recounting the wicked fact of King Aga∣memnon in sacrificing his only daughter Iphigenia, being a young damsell of excel∣lent beauty, to the intent to please the wrathfull gods, hinderers of his navigation, after he had said all, closed it up in this one verse, spoken in Epiphonema. Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum. They shall be judged by the Law of nature, they having never heard of Christ nor his word, shall not be punished for not beleeving such things. The Heathens were Polytheists, worshippers of many Gods. The Pantheon at Rome was built by Domitian the Emperour Anno gratiae 85. that is,Matth. Westm. Flor. Hist p. 55. Id. ibid. p. 109. a Temple for the honour of all the Gods; or rather devils, Eo quod in eodem quondam omnium non Deorum, sed daemonum cultus agebatur. The Scripture frequently cals such Idol-worship the worship of devils. They generally worshipt the Sun, as Macrobius and others shew.

Firm. matern.It is a question, An ex meliore usu legis naturae pendeat revelatio Evangelii, whe∣ther the revelation of the Gospel depend on the better use of the Law of Nature? Walaeus in his answer to Corvinus, c. 5. alledgeth Rom. 3.11. & Psal. 14.3. and saith, that experience gives testimony to this assertion of the Scripture, for there was never any found amongst those Nations, to whom the Gospel was not preached, who drew the knowledge of Christ from the light of nature, or to whom God miraculously revealed Christ for his improving the Law of Nature. Cornelius lived at Caesarea, with the Jews. Job was of the posterity of Abraham, he instructed his posterity▪ Gen. 18.19. nay God often passed by those who most improved the light of nature, and revealed Christ by the Gospel to those who were more wicked and perverse then they, Deut. 32.28. Ezek. 3.16. & 5.6. Matth. 11.21. not to So∣crates, Plato, Aristides, Cato, Jaudatissima inter Gentiles nomina, but to more wicked. Sed patibulo affixus interrit. Quid istud ad causam? Neque cuim qualitas & deformnas mortis dicta ejus immutat aut facta, aut eo minor videbitur disciplinarum ejus auctorita, quia vinculis corporis non naturali dissolutione di∣gressus est, sed vi illata decessit. Pythagoas Samius suspicione dominationis injusta vivus concrematus in fano est; numquid a quae docuit, vim propriam perdiderant, quiae non spiritum sponte, sed crudelitate appetitus effudit? Similiter Socrates ivitatis suae judicio damnatus, capitali affectus est paena: numqua irrita facta sunt, quae sunt ab eo de moribus, virtutibus & officiis disputata, quia injuria expulsus è vita est? Arnob. Advers. Gent. l. 1.But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness, 1 Cor. 1.23. The Jews mock us, because we had such a Messiah which cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? If he was God (say they) why did he so cry out? did not all troubles come to him by his own will? Wisdom is justified of her children. We have those famous Apologies of Justin Martyr, who dedicated his first to the Roman Senate,Anno Aerae hristi 303. Persecutionis flammae olum addiderunt Por phyrius, Hiero∣cles, & alii; qui contra Reli∣gionem christi∣anam scripse∣runt: Rursum ex medio inimicorum suorum Dem excitavit Arno∣bium Rhetorem, qui constantia Martyrum permotus, ad Religionem Christianam accessit, eamque contra Porphy∣rium & alios defendit, idem fecit postea La∣ctantitu Arnobit discipulus ex Philosopho Episcoper, Calvis.

He is styled by Pierius Valeriaenus, Acerrimus Christiani nominis propugnator. The wiser Heathens did call the Christians Idiots, and reproached them as il∣literate. But the Atheist cannot name any age wherein the Heathen had an Oliver to oppugne our Christian profession, but we had a Rowland to defend it. If they had a Porphyrie or Celsus to oppose Philosophy against it, we had an Arnobius, an Origen to maintain and follow Christianity. If they had a Symmachus, we had an
Ambrose and Prudentius: If they had a Julian, we had a Gregory Nazianzen. Those Atlassia of Christian Religion equalled the most renowned. Heathens in all Learning (as well as they exceeded them in true Religion:) Such among others were Justin a Philosopher and Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Cyprian, Origen, (Learned to a miracle) Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius, Epiphanius, the three Learned Gregories, Nazianzene, Nyssene, Thaumaturgus, both the Basils, Atha∣nasius, Cyrill, Minutius Faelix, Arnobius, Chrysostom, Jerom, Ambrose, La∣ctantius, Austin, Prosper, Hilary, Prudentius, and others, of most eminent Learn∣ing, piety and courage, who defended the Christian Religion against proud Hea∣thens and pestilent Hereticks of those daies.

By whom the Christian Religion was first brought hither, is disputed, some say by James the brother of John, some Simon Zelotes, some Peter and Paul, others Joseph of Arimathea, some Gregory the Pope.

dignity was not bound, he cryed, Cur non & me quoque torque donas, & infignis hujus ordinis militem creas? Give me my chain to, let me be a Knight of the same Order. CHAP. III. The second great false Religion is Mahometism. Vide Laurentii Ludovici Leo∣bergensis Orat. 10, & 11. De Mahom. in∣crement. & Forbes nstruct. Histor. Theol. l. 4. c. 1. de Muhammede, de origine doctrinae Muhammedicae & Alcorani l. 4. c 3. de Impicta∣te doctrinae Muhammedanae; c. 4. usque ad cap. 14. Vide Matth. Westm. p. 111, 112.IN the Year of our Lord 666, the detestable Sect of Mahumet began to take strength and place. Moamed or Machumed an Ishmaelite being a poor man till he married a widow wealthy and of high countenance: having the falling sickness, where∣by the widow was sorry that she matched with him, perswaded her by himself and others, that his fits were but a trance, wherein he talked with the Angel Gabriel. The woman made women beleeve that her husband was a Prophet: afterwards men by help of certain Heretiques set the false Prophet forward. From Judaism Arius, Nestorius, and his own brain he frameth a Doctrine. He prevaileth so by force of his wilde company and guile deceiving the simple, that before his death he winneth Arabia, and the Countries about Euphrates. The sonnes of Ishmael ashamed of Agars name, borrow from Sara the term of Saracens. Brought. Concent. He gave sundry Laws to his followers, patched of many Sects and Religions to∣gether: He taught them to pray ever to the South, and as we keep the Sunday, so they keep the Friday, which they call the day of Venus. He permitted them to have as many Wives as they were able to maintain; to have as many Concubines as they list;Mahomet was born in the Country of Arabia. His Father was a Persian, his mother an Ishmaelite, which Ishmaelites being a people of Arabia, were called then Agarens, which term Mahumet afterward turned to the name of Saracens. Vide Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 7. c. 8. to abstain from the use of wine, except on certain solemn daies in the year; to have and worship only one God omnipotent, saying that Moses and the Prophets were great men, but Christ was greater, and greatest of all the Pro∣phets, as being born of the Virgin Mary by the power of God, without mans seed, and at last was taken up to heaven, but was not slain, but another in his likeness for him. Fox's Act. and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 161. See 963, 964. The Persians beleeve in Mahomet, yet the Turks and they differ in opinion about him, the one pursuing the other with most deadly hatred, insomuch that there is almost continuall Warre between them. In Alcorano Libro Legis co∣rum habetur, Iesum Christum Dominum no∣strum de Maria Virgine fuisse conceptum & natum, quem sine peccato vixisse inter homines, Prophetam{que} & plus quam Prophetam esse profitentur. Caecos enim illuminasse, laeprosos mundasse, & mortuos prorsus susci∣tasse astruunt. Verum quoque asserunt cum ad caelum ascendisse. Lex illorum, quam Diabolo dictante, ministerio Sergii Mo∣nachi apostaca & haeretics, Mhometus Arabic è scriptam Saracenis dedit & docuit, à gladto caepit, per gladium tenetur, & in gladio termenatur. Iste Mahometus illiteratus fuit, sicut ipse in Alchorano suo testatur: qui quae praenominatus baereticus dictavit, ipse praedicavit. Et quia potens erat, & Arabum Princeps, per comminationes suas legem statuit observari. Luxurio∣sus autem fuit & bellicosus, & ideo de immunditia & vanitate legem dedit, quam carnaliter viventes in partem voluptatis observant: & sicut legem Christi veritas & munditia muniunt, ita errorem ipsorum timor mundanus & humanus, voluptas{que} carnalis extollunt.

Epist. l. 1. p. 28, 29, 32.The Alcoran is given out for the Word of God; it is written in Arabick verse, in form of a Dialogue between the Angell Gabriel and their Prophet, it is prohi∣bited to be translated, which both preserves the Arabick tongue and conceals the Religion. Mr. Henry Blunt's Voyage into the Levant, p. 146. The Alcoran is stuft with obsceanness, lies, miracles, visions, morall and na∣turall Philosophy; such trash as may wonderfully provoke the silliest Student to a height of laughter. It is in Volume twice so big as the Psalmes of David, divided into a hundred and fourteen Chapters. He denies Christ to be the Son of God, and saith, that the Virgin conceived by smelling to a Rose presented her by Gabriel,
and that he was born out of her breasts. Also that he was not crucified, but Judas or some other wicked thief; Christ being separated from them by a cloud that covered him, and came from heaven, Herb. Trav. l. 2. p. 273, & 254. Brerewood in his Enquiries,Amongst other qualities whereby Ma∣hometism pos∣sesseth the minds of men, one, is its pleasing do∣ctrine.

Mr Henry Blunts Voyage into the Levant. p. 149. Quam longè latéque se diffuderit pestiferum illud virus haereseos Mohamedicae, historiae passim docent, & qui Regiones Orientis peragrárunt testari facilè possunt. Ubicunque verò Religio Mohamedis Arabis viget, ibi Arabum lingua in sacris sola in usu est. Hoc ipse legislator manifestis verbis sub paena capitis sancivit. Tantùm autem Mo∣hamedis religio patet, teste Postello, ut vix tertiae parsterrarum orbis nobis Christianis reliqua sit. Imò abultimis extremi occidentis oris, hoc est, ab insulis Fortunatis ad Maluccarum usque insulas in extremo Orientis, Mohametismum regnare certum est. In Graecia olim eloquentiae & Religionis syncerioris parente, in Thracia, Molachia, Natolia, Armenia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Chaldaea, Perfide, India, & insulis adjacentibus, Paelaestina, Arabia, Aegypto, Nubia, Marmarica, Numi∣dia, Mauritania, denique in tota ferè Africa viget Mohametismus, ac ibi lingua quoque Arabica quasi pro vernacula est. Wilhelm. Bed wel. Praesat. Johan. Apost. & Evangelist. Epist. Cathol. Arab. Vide Laurent. Ludov Leobernensis Orat. 10, & 11. de Mahom. Increm. cap. 11. gives four reasons of the spreading of Ma∣humetanism, whereof two are, 1. Their peremptory restraint (even on the pain of death) of all disputations touching their Religion, and calling any point of it into question. 2. The sensuall liberty allowed by it, viz. to have many wives, and the like promise of sensuall pleasures to succeed after this life (to the Religious observers of it) in Paradise. God was pleased to suffer a base Epileptick person, a villain and vitious, to set up a Religion which hath filled almost all Asia and Africa, and some parts of Europe.

The Janizaries (many of which were at first Christians) are the greatest strength of the Turkish Empire, being first instituted by Amurath the first,Janizari vel Jenizari praeci∣puum sunt Im∣peratoris Turcici robur: atque ex iis etiam eligun∣tur Imperatoris ejusce custodes: ac quia aula Soltani porta Osmonica nuncupatur eò àjanuae vocabulo Janizari putan∣tur vocitari. Vossius de vi∣tiis Sermonis, l. 2. c. 10. they are often dreadfull unto the great Turk himself; after whose death they have sometimes preferred to the Empire such of the Emperours sonnes as they best liked, without respect of prerogative of age, contrary to the will of the great Sultan himself. Some suppose they are not unlike in time to be the chief cause of the ruine of that large Empire. The Christians themselves in Turkie are Sed & regnum Turcicum Christianis adeò soecundum esse constans sama est, ut si hominum numero certandum sit, facilè uni Muselmanno, quo nomine gaudent Turcae, sen Alcoranitae, tres opponi posse Christianos; crudele autem barbarorum jugum ob certaminum, quae sovent, varietatem, & contraria, in qua scinduntur, studia, mutnasque, quibus laborant dissentiones excutere non posse.

When any of the Janizaries have committed ought worthy of death, the custom is to send the same party in the night time over by Boat from Constantinople to Pera; where by the way he is thrown into the water with a great stone about his neck, and then there is a piece of Ordinance shot off, which is a token of some such execution. The Turk is forced to take this course, lest the rest of his Jani∣zaries should mutiny when any of their fellows is put to death. That complicate errour of the Socinians sprung from Mahometism.Turpissimam Socinistarum gentem è fi∣metis Muhammedanorum prosiltisse, hinc certum est, quòd non modò blasphemo ore conspirant cum Turcis in abneganda Jesu Christi divina natura verùm etiam quòd cum in finem Christianam fidem ita subvertant, ut Christianos cum Muhammedanis uniant ac consocient faedere exsecrabili.

Before the Turks come to prayer, they prepare themselves thereunto by out∣ward washing of themselves in token of reverence, and suffer no women to come to their Churches, left the sight of them should withdraw their mindes from prayer. CHAP. IV. The third false Religion is Iudaism. Purch. Pilgrim. l. 2. c. 11.THey were after the Babylonian Captivity called Jews of the chief and royall Tribe, and their Country Judea. Before Christs death the Gospel was revealed only to the Jews, a few Gentiles were brought in, as Rahab, Joh, the people of Nineveh; after his resurrection it was revealed to all Nations, Mark 16.16. The first Church that ever was gathered, was of the Jews, Matth. 15.24. Luke 24.47. Because 1. They were the first-born, and their Fathers were in Covenant with God, Gen. 17.7.2. Christ came of them after the flesh, Rom. 9.4, 5. The Jews look for a Messiah to come in outward pomp, yet some of their Rab∣bines say, In Regno Messiae nihil mundanum. They detested the Publicanes of old as most vile sinners, but now they are the only Publicans who serve under the Turk; no man will trust them now they are so perfidious. See Deut. 32.26. They are of more vile account in the sight of Turks then Christians; insomuch that if a Jew would turn Turk, he must first turn Christian before they will admit him to be a Turk, Biddulphs Travels. They deride Christ with that reproachfull and despitefull name Talui, which is as much as hanged or crucified. After their prayers, they utter an execrable curse against all Christians and Baptized Jews.Judaei in suis Synagogis sin∣gulis diebus ter Christo male∣dicunt, Hieron. in Esai l. 22. c. 49. Tom. 5. & l. 14. c. 42. diebus & no∣ctibus blasphe∣mant Salvato∣rem, & sub nomine Nazaraeorum ter in die in Christianos congerunt maledicta. They are given much to Fables, Titus 1.14. Nunquam tam bene intellexi quae de Judaicis fabulis vitandis monet Paulus, atque quum Talmud. gustavi. Wal. Epist. Walaeo Gomarus. This is a sign that they are given up by God to a reprobate minde, as the Lord threatens, Deut. 28.28.

Rerum, l. 8. c. 4. saith, the people of the Jews, though it imbraced the same Law, was divided into divers Sects, Nazarenes, Pharisees, Essenes, Saducees, Samaritans, Herodians. There are three principall Sects among the Jews, Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.
1. Pharisees. They were the strictest Sect among the Jews, Act. 26. those that pretended most of all to walk according to the rules of the Jewish Religion. Paul the Apostle was a Pharisee. See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evan. parte tertia, Dub. 28. & Cameron on Matth. 20. v. 3. 2. The Sadducees. Antigonus Master to Sadoc the Father of the Sadducees, exhorted his Schollars to embrace the Law, not looking for a reward, that is, for love of it self.De eo quod di∣cuntur negasse spiritus, non disputo. Sane ut multi putant, sic sequeretur eos negasse legem Mosaicam, quae variis in locis Angelorum mentionem fa∣cit. Praeterea certum est eos non negasse librorum Propheticorum autoritatem, ut ex Talmude liquet. Menasseh Ben Israel de Resurrectione, cap. 6. Vide Camer. praelect. Tom. 3. in Matth. 20. v. 3. p. 45. Sadoc and the Sadducees after him taught that there was no reward after this life, and therefore no resurrection. Dr Lightfoots 3d part of his Harmony, Sect. 6. It is noted of them, that of all other Sects, they were the most cruell in their judiciall censures, as Euseb. Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 14. out of Josephus. They denied the resurrection and last judgement; so as they were Atheists. This made them dare to practice all cruelty and injustice: For Maxima peccandi illecebra impuni∣tatis spes. See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evang. parte tertia Dub. 29. 3. The Essenes. From whom some fetch the originall of Christian Monks. There were also Scribes, Learned men, which professed the reading and inter∣pretation of the Law, either of the Sect of the Pharisees or Sadducees. The Jews had so high an opinion of the Scribes and Pharisees, that they thought if but two went to heaven, one must be a Scribe and the other a Pharisee. For Justification, They found no need of the righteousness of Christ,How often doth Christ thunder a∣gainst the Scribes and Pharisees, Matth. 15.6, 9, 12. Matth. 23. severall verses. there∣fore Christ saith he came not to call such righteous persons (in their own conceit) but sinners. See Rom. 10.3. For Sanctification: All their righteousness came from self, that which may be found in a naturall man; they knew not what Regeneration or a new nature meant, John 3.4.10. 2. Not the Law, but their interpretation of it was their rule, Matth. 5.27. 3. They pleaded their obedience before God, All these have I kept from my youth. The Rabbins have much from old Writers agreeable to the Apostles Doctrine, but stained with dogged blasphemies, notwithstanding their readiness in the Text and Records in pieces of ancient Truth must be regarded. As touching their say∣ings, fighting for us against themselves, I think them profitable when they are cited with skill, what they do mean or ought to mean, otherwise they will trouble much men little acquainted with them. H. Broughton of Melchis. Two things are most firmly to be held against the Jews. 1. That the promised Messiah is come. 2. That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah. The first is most certain from these Arguments. 1. Because the Messiah ought to come when the Scepter was taken from Judah, Gen. 49. If the words of our Fa∣ther Jacob be true, and there is no Scepter nor Lawgiver now in the house of Ju∣dah, then must it needs be this man Jesus, whom we confess and believe, is that Shilo which was to come. The Confession of Faith made by Nathanael the Jew, Baptized by Mr. Fox. 10. 2. Because he was to come before the destroying of the second Temple, Hag. 2.8, 10. Mal. 3.1. 3. Because the place of the Nativity of the Messiah hath been destroyed for 1500 years and more: That is, Bethlehem, Mic. 5.2. 4. Because the Oracles and Heathenish Idolatries, and also the Leviticall Cere∣monies have ceased, Zach. 13.2, 4. Dan. 9.26, 27. The second also is most certain, That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah, be∣cause all the Prophesies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah, agree to him.
1. He was born when the Scepter departed from Judah, according to the Pro∣phesie of Jacob, Gen. 49. Locus hic est insignis, & ve∣hementer urit Judaeos. Quare vix alius est, quem tot & tàm variis támque inter se discrepantibus glossis contami∣naverint. Helv. System. Controv. Theol. quae Christian. cum Judaeis interce∣dunt. 10. 2. He came while the second Temple stood, Hag. 2.8. Mal. 3.1. 3. He was born in Bethlehem, Mic. 5.2. Matth. 2. Luk. 2. 4. When he came the Oracles ceased, according to that Zach. 13.24. as it is manifest from Plutarch, about the ceasing of Oracles, Juvenals 6th Satyre and Ecclesiasticall History. 5. He abrogated the Leviticall Ceremonies and Sacrifices, Dan. 9.26, 27. Jer. 3.16. Aben-Ezra upon Isa. 52.13. confesseth that the Jewish Rabbins affirm, that those things are spoken of the Messiah. So also doth Abrabaneel upon the place: and the Chaldee Paraphrast there for  My servant, hath  My servant Messiah. The Conversion of the Jews is called by Paul a mystery, it is uncertain when it shall be. Marsilius Fici∣nus in his book de Relig. Christian. c. 37. gives these reasons why the Jews do not yet im∣brace the Christian faith, Prophe∣ticorum Christianorumque mysteriorum divina profunditos; & quia divina, ideo humana intelligentia non penetrabilis Rursus ingenium mercenariorum miserabilium{que} Judaeorum incultum prorsus & pertinax. Avaritia tum ejus, quod suum est servandi, tum faciendi saenoris inexplebilis. Naturalis suorum amor inuatum odium Christianorum.There are divers hinderances of their Conversion. 1. The great differences among Christians. 2. Their slighting and undervaluing of Gospel Ministry and Ordinances, the multitude of Heresies and Blasphemies. 3. Their loose lives, swearing, cursing, Sabbath-breaking. 4. The great Idolatry of the Church of Rome, artolatria & iconolatria: The Jews hate Image-worship. 5. The severe carriage of Christians in civil commerce with them. Helps to their Conversion. 1. Unity. 2. Holiness of life and conversation. 3. The love of the Gospel, and propagation of it to dark places. 4. Knowledge and skill in the Old Testament, and Rabbins. 5. Earnest prayer. When we were out of Covenant they prayed for us, Cant. 8.8.Nihil (mihi credite) ad Judaeorum im∣pudentiam con∣futandam repe∣ritur adeo va∣lidam, nihilque ad corum con∣vincendam ne∣quitiam tam efficax inveni∣tur, ut est Hebraicae linguae & traeditionum suarum cognitio. Wakesieldi. Orat. de laude & utilitate trium Linguarum, Arab. Chald. & Hebr. By those arguments, Joh. 5.30. Act. 17.2. & 18.28. Rom. 16.26. many Jews have been overcome. Johannes Isaac a Jew was converted by reading Isa. 53. And conferring with five Rabbins at Frankefort, out of that Chapter he brought them to such straits, that they could not answer. Isaac contra Lindanum l. 2. defens. Heb. verit. Lyra, Immanuell Tremellius, Paulus Ricius, Lud. Carretus, were converted Jews. Mr Fox preached a Sermon at the Baptisme of a Jew.

We protest and proclaim that we have very little hope of their salvation, who either out of negligence of seeking the truth, or unwillingness to finde it, live and die in the impieties of that Church. Chillingworth ch. 3. Sect. 63. Sr Edwin Sands in his Europae speculum, or Relation of Religion of the Western parts of the World, discovers fully the superstitions and gross corruptions of the Church of Rome. He shews how their State is strangely compacted of infinite contrarieties. What pomp, what riot to that of their Cardinals? What severity of life com∣parable to their Hermites and Capuchins? Who wealthier then their Prelates? Who poorer by vow and profession then their Mendicants? On the one side of the street a Cloyster of Virgins: On the other a Sty of Courtezans, with publick toleration: This day all in masks with all looseness and foolery; to morrow all in Processions, whipping themselves till the blood follow. On one door an Ex∣communication, throwing to hell all transgressours; on another, a Jubilee or full discharge from all transgressions. He saith this is a Proverb recorded in their own books, That the worst Christians of Italy are the Romanes, of the Romanes the Priests are wickedest, the lewdest Priests are preferred to be Cardinals, and the baddest man among the Cardinals is chosen to be Pope. There is a twofold separation. One condemned, Jude v. 19. when men separate from a Church where salvation is to be had: Christ did not separate from the communion of the Jewish Church, John 4.21, 22. but from the corruptions of it. He frees the Law from the false glosses of the Pharisees, the 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters of Matthew, he would
not joyn with them in their superstitious purifications. They kept the Passeover a day after its time, he kept it a day before they kept it, Matth. 26.27. 2. Another commended and Palam est no∣stram à nobis Ecclesiam re∣formatam esse ex mero ipsius verbo quod unum est pro regula, ad quam & instituenda illa sit, & tuenda legitime. Plusquam idoneae sunt rationes quae ad mutationem illam nos ad gerunt cujus praejudicio falso urgemur. Primum nempe caput Christianismi est, ut Deus colatur.

Porro quid sunt aliud publicae illae preces, quam stre∣pitus ignoti & vlui exo uluiatus?

The first consideration is, how to reform the body of the Church, for that, let often Generall Councels be celebrated and other directions he gives. 2. To reform the Head, that is, the State of the Pope, and the Court of Rome and shews means for that. 3. To reform the principall parts of the Church, viz. the Prelates, and gives directins for that. 4. To reform about Rligion and religious persons, and he prescribes rules for that. 5. To reform the other Ecclesiasticall persons. 6. To reform the Christian Lay-people. Vide Wolfii Lect. Memorab. Centen. 15.Gerhard. in his Confess. Cathol. l. 1. General. part. 1. c. 4. shews, that many before Luthers time confessed that the Doctrine of the Church of Rome was corrupt and needed Reformation, and some that were his contemporaries, and also after him, did the like. One saith the Papists Liturgies are full of Idolatry and blasphemies, their Legends full of lies, their Ceremonies of superstition. Cardinall Mattheo Langi, Archbishop of Salzburg, told every one, that the reformation of the Mass was honest, the liberty of meats convenient, and the de∣mand just to be disburthened of so many Commandments of men, but that a poor Monk should reform all, was not to be endured. And Cornelius Scoperus the Emperours Secretary, said, that if the Protestant Preachers had money, they would easily buy of the Italians what Religion pleased them best, but without gold it was impossible to make theirs shine in the world. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, l. 1. pag. 55. The Pope in the beginning of the Councell of Trent, being desired to make a Reformation to please the Lutherans, No saith he, it is in vain, a whole Reforma∣tion will undo the Church, and a halt Reformation will not gratifie the Lutherans, therefore it is better to imbitter both the parties. In the vacancies of the Sea of Rome the Cardinals use to compose certain capitu∣lations to reform the Papall Government, which all swear to perform, if they shall be assumed to the Popedom, though it appear by all precedent examples, that every one sweareth with a minde not to keep them in case he shall be Pope. For so soon as he is elected, he saith he could not bind himself, and that he is at liberty by gaining the Papacy. History of the Councel of Trent, l. 1. p. 71.

Melchior. Adam. in Vita Gobelini. which holding the foundation reje∣cted their errours, and out of Babylonish darkness he brought many to the sight of the truth, as Waldo, Wickliff, Luther, Zuinglius. God stirred up in severall ages some publick and constant Confessors of the Faith, which publickly set themselves against Popery, some of which resisting it even unto blood, had the Crown of Martyrdom. Those Confessors may be di∣stributed into three Classes or ranks. The first comprehends the whole Churches, the Waldenses and the Greek Church. The other comprehends the Emperours and Kings which opposed themselves to the Papall Tyranny. The third the Doctors and Martyrs, which taxed the errours and abuses brought into the Church. Bellarmine, Bozius, Cocceius, Costerus and others, have written many things of the Marks or Signes of a Church: Costerus reckons three, Cocceius five, Bellar∣mine fifteen, Bozius a hundred: Some assign more, some fewer Marks, but all greatly glory of the holiness of the Roman Church, as a speciall and infallible note: If the question be of the Roman Church, they answer, It is One, Holy, Catholicall, Apostolicall: If of the Papall Sea, The Holy, Apostolicall Sea: If of the Pope of Rome, The most Holy Father: If they speak to him, Your Holiness: Oh quam sancta omnia? But whether we understand of holiness of Doctrine, or holiness of Life, how little holiness is to be found amongst them? What holiness of Doctrine is there in that Tenet, to hold that Priests may not marry. See Heb. 13.4. What holiness of life there is amongst them, their Stews, and their dissolute courses shew. The nine choice persons elected by Paul the third, to reform their Church, com∣plain of the Stews In hac etiam urbe meretrices ut matronae in∣cedunt per ur∣bem, seu mula vehuntur, quas assectantur de media die nobi∣les familiares Cardinales clerici{que} nulla in urbe vidimus hanc corruptionem praeterquam in hac omnium exemplari, habitant eti∣am insignes aedes: corrigendus hic etiam turpis abusus., Roma vale, vidi, satis est vidisse, revertar, Cum leno, aut meretrix, Scurra, Cinaedus ero.

How dissolute and prodigiously wicked many of the Popes have been,They teach, that Priests offend less, if they, whore, then if they marry. the Po∣pish Writers themselves mention. How unclean and Sodomiticall many of their Cardinals were, we have evident Testimony. See the Scarlet Gown, or the History of all the present Cardinals at Rome. How desperate the life and death of many Jesuites hath been,John Casa Archbishop of Beneventum, the Popes Le∣gate at Venice, wrote in the commendation of a most abominable filthiness, and set forth with wicked eloquence that sinne which ought not to be named scarce among Christians.

Petrus Fragius Doctor of Divinity made an Oration to the Fathers of the Councell of Trent to assert the authority of the Pope of Rome: He told them God had prayed for Peter, who being after converted, confirmed his brethren in the faith. Si igitur (said he) Dominus pro Petro precatus est, cur jam pro Julio non pre∣cabitur. What is Christ more weak or cruell now then he was? and is Julius in∣feriour in dignity and office to Peter himself? Minime verò vel ipsis crepantibus Antichristus. But thou wilt say, that none was strengthened in the faith by Julius? But dost not thou see a remedy prepared, viz. an Oecumenicall Councell.

They teach that hereticks are to be extirpated with fire and sword.

They use fraudulent means, they make use of spurious writings, defend equivo∣cation, they shelter themselves with false Miracles, Legends, Relicks.They have many fabulous books. That Massacre of Paris was very cruel, but ushered in with pretences of great love and friendship,The confor∣mities of St Francis, the Legends of Saints, the Popes Decre∣tals. There are three maxims (saith Peter du Moulin) which are the pillars of Popery. The first of which is, That the Church of Rome cannot erre. The second, That the Pope and the Church of Rome are not subject to the holy Scripture, but have more Authority then it.Anatomie De La messe Par Pierre Du Moulin. l. 1. c. 9. The third, That the Pope and Church of Rome have power to change the Com∣mandments of God, and to make new Articles of Faith. Dr Preston (as I remember) reduceth all to these two heads: 1. That the true Church cannot erre. 2. That the Church of Rome is that true Church. Peter du Moulin in his Anatomie De La messe l. 4. Chap. 5. shews when England received the Orders of Rome, Chap. 7. when Popery was brought into France, and Chap. 8. when it was brought into Spain. What opinion was there heretofore of Monkery? What esteem have the Papists of it still?Ita enim tune hominibus per∣suasum erat: Monachatum aequipollere Baptismo: esse statum perfe∣ctionis: sta∣tuta & regulas Monasticas verbo Dei multis parasangis ante ire: habitum Monasticum sanctitate praestare aliis vestibus: Et qui in cucullo sepeliatur, cum remissionem tertiae partis peccatorum suorum consequi: ac hujusmodi sexcenta alia. Melch. Adam. in vita Fridmyconii. This is one of the Prerogatives of the Order of St Francis and St Dominick, that the habit of St Francis or St Dominick is worthy a second Baptism, and that by this habit all the former sins are blotted out. Whence it came, that many Princes and Persons of quality in mortal diseases, have put on the habit of St Francis, that they might blot out all their sins. Learned Rudolphus Agricola dying at Heidelberg was buried in a Franciscans habit by the Minorites, as he commanded. Campians brag in his third reason, Ad Patres si quando licebit accedere; confectum est praelium, tam sunt nostri, quam Gregorius ipse Decimus tertius, filiorum Eccle∣siae Pater amantissimus, is succinctly and pithily answered by our learned Whitaker, Quem nos filiorum Ecclesiae hostem capitalem & furiosum esse novimus, eum tu Pa∣trem vocas amantissimum, & quam hoc verum est, tam illud esse verum concludis. Fa∣teor ambo, quam illud, utrumque enim falsissimum. CHAP. VI. Of the Reformed Religion. THe people of God which are called and come out of Babylon need not a new plantation of a Church, but a Reformation only.Des le regne du Roy Henry, La Religion auoi commencè de poindre, qui par ses Sectateurs fut appellec Re∣formee, comme celle qu ils disoient avoir reforme les abus de nostre eglise, & par les autres plus retenus en ancionuetè, opinion novelle Pasquier Des Recherches de la France, l. 8. ch. 25.

Gerhard in his Catholick Confession, lib. 1. General. part. 1. cap. 4. saith, That Luther in his work of Reformation, Non fuisse novi alicujus dogmatis inventorem, sedantiquae fidei assertorem; nec fuisse novae Ecclesiae autorem, sed pristinae repur∣gatorem. Junius noster dicere solebat, Papistas ita in fundamentis errare, ut à funda∣mentis non aberrarent, cui ego plane assentio. Walaei Epistolae Antonio Walaeo Hugo Grotio. Gerhard in his first General Book of his Catholick Confession, chap. 6. speaks of Luther the instrument of Reformation, and chap. 7. of the occasion of Reforma∣tion, the immoderate extolling of the Popes indulgences, and the excessive gain of those that vented them. The Prophet Zachary saith, The man whose name is the Branch, he shall build the Temple of the Lord: Because, 1. The Temple is Christs house, Matth. 16.18. Heb. 3.6. 2. Christ hath undertaken this work. Id eo magis commemorabile est, quod Zuin∣glius, & Lu∣therus, & Cal∣vinus qui sucrūt in Reformatio∣ne principes, confilia inter se non communcea∣runt. Zuinglius enim viam ad Reformationem in Helvetia affe∣ctaverat anno integro ante quā Lutherus in Germania appa∣reret. At conatus illius fama ad Lutherum non manaverat, & quum primum adversus Indulgentias praedicare incoepit, quid rerum istarum Tiguri gereretur penitas ignorabat. Calvinus utroque paulo junior, & exortus cum utriusque fama jam in Europa percrebuerat, non potuit quin de alterutro, vel de utroque aliquid inaudisset, antequam Pontificis Romani auctoritatem in Gallia convellere adoriretur. Neque vero negavit unquam quin signum ab aliis sublatum, & procul à se conspectum secutus sit. Amyrald de Secess. ab Eccles. Rom p. 44, 45. Anno 1553.6.

Meteranus de rebus Belgicis. l. 1. Ante centum annos, reformationis novae opus aggressurus Christus non purpuratum aliquem praesulem, neque nominis fama florentissimos adhibuit Cardinales, sed Martinum Lutherum Monachum: Augustimanum, Thillppum Melancthonem, Graecae Linguae, in Accademia Wittebergenfi, Professorem, & duos infimi sublllii sacrificulos, Huldricum Zuinglium, & Joannem Oecolampadium, suscitavit, Sculteti Concio Secularis de Evangelii Doctrina. Vbilegisset Albertus Crantzius Theses Lutheri, dixit: Se quidem eas approbare, sed tamen me∣tuere ne tantis conatibus impar, à potente Papa supprimatur: Ideoque de Luthero ait, ô frater, abi in cellam tuam, & dic Domine miserere mei. Wolf. Lect memorab. Tom. 10. Cent. 115.This appears in the work of Reformation, because they which were the chief Reformers did not communicate their counsels to one another; and likewise if we consider the instruments, by Luther a Monk, and other mean men in Germany, and by Edward the 6th a childe in England, and by a woman Q. Elizabeth, that such a glorious work should be effected. Also if we observe how our cause from the beginning against the will of Empe∣rours, and my Kings, maugre the malice of Popes, hath taken increase, and by little and little pread into all Countreys. Quibus armis obsecro vos intra annos 58. plus minus, expugnatum ferè est Anti∣christi regnum in tota prope Europa: Regnum vero Christi longè lateque propagatum per homines imbecilles atque inermes, per Lutherum cum suis in Germania, per Zuin∣glium in Helvetia, per Calvinum in Galliis, perque alios, aliis in locis, nisi vi verbi & Spiritus Sanctus, qui in ipsis locutus est, suasque exeruit vires, adversus omnem mundi, & Satanae potestatem?

Nullo modo patiuntur hunc Christo honorem tribui, ut justitia nostra vocetur, nisi in partem simul veriant operm merita. Non disceptamus hic de bonis operibus, an praestari à piis debeant, an accepta sint Deo, an mercedum apud cum habcant: sed an concilient nos Deo sua dignitate, an acquzramus eorum pretio vitam aeternam, an compensationes sint quae ad collendum reatum Dei judicio solvantur, an collocanda sit in ipsis salutis fiducia. Id. ibid.The Church of Rome was so unsound in Doctrine, and corrupt in worship, that it was no schism but a duty then to separate from it.
The means taken by the first Reformers for promoting the work of Reformation of Religion. 1. They searched diligently into the Word of God,They are fitly therefore called Evangelici, from their great respect to the Gospel, and the whole Scripture. and so discovered the er∣rours of Popery. Their care was after to translate the Bible into vulgar languages, and to interpret it to the people, and illustrate it with ample Comments. 2. They were carefull to educate children in the Principles of Christian Religion and Piety. It is a piece of Luthers counsel, if ever you would have a good Refor∣mation look to the Reformation of children. 3. They were ready to dispute with their Adversaries in all places, and speedily to reply to their writings. Nonne tot disputationes Witembergenses, Ratisbonienses, Augustanae, Spiren∣ses, Wormantienses, Bernenses, Possiacenae, Londinenses, Cantabrigienses, Ox∣onienses testes esse possunt locupletissimae: quo animo, qua doctrina, qua veritate cau∣sam Religionis nostrae propugnaverimus. Whitakeri ad Rat. primam Camp. Respons. Chamier hath answered the Papists generally in his learned Panstratia Ca∣tholica. Bellarmine is well answered by Junius, Ames, Whitaker. The Rhemist Testament and the Notes are well confuted by Cartwright and Fulk. Casaubone hath written learned Exercitations against Baronius. Bishop Morton, Doctor Fulk and Whitaker have answered the Treatises of se∣veral Papists. Rivet and Blondel and Moulin have answered Cardinal Peroon. Bishop Vsher, Bishop Andrews, Bishop Ab Doctor Prideaux, and others of our Divines, have stouly opposed other Papists. The Reformed Religion is well defended by the English and French Divines. Some much commend three Epistles, that Epistle or Preface of Calvins to his In∣stitutions: That of Casaubons to his Exercitations against Baronsus; and that of Thuanus or Guicchardine before his History. That of Calvins is a succinct and pi∣thy Apology for the Protestant Religion. Juels Apology was generally liked by the Reformed Churches. Daillè, Croyus, Blondel, Jacobus Capellus, Amyrot, and Gentilettus, have written in French or Latine in Defence of the Reformed Religion. 4. They diligently compiled the Histories of those times and actions, and especi∣ally Martyrologies of such as rendred by their deaths a testimony to that truth which was persecuted in them.Quod verò ve∣terum doctrinam ita extollis, ut nostri temporis homines, neque pietate, neque eruditione cum ipsorum minimo conferendos esse censeas, id mi∣nimè ferendum est. Nam quamvis nostra tenuitatis con∣scii, id de nobis meritò possimus ac debcamus fateri, de multis tamen id, sine magna in Deum ingratitudine, & in homines injustitia dici non potest. Quam∣vis enim Patres antiqui sua habuerint ad eruditionem subsidia, duobus tamen maximè necessariis ad solidiorem sacrarum litera∣rum notitiam comparandam adjumentis, librorum copia & liuguarum doctoribus, caruerunt. Nam primum quum Cyprianus, Hieronymus, Augustinus ad scribendum accederent, pauca de Christiana Religione quibus uterentur, extabant, & b de∣scriptionis difficultatem rara & cara erant exemplaria: Nostrum verò seculum eò feliciùs est, quod plurima etiam ab illis Pa∣tribus caeterisque paulatim sint conscripta, & typographiae (olim ignotae) beneficio, magna copia & tolerabili pretio comparen∣tur: Adcò ut quae longo tempore & maximo labore à veteribus indagata sunt, ea cito ac facilè ex scriptis eorum possint addisci. Deinde verò quam pauci ex Latinis Patribus ullam Graecas lingua notitiam habuerunt, quam rari ex omnibus Patribus Hebraeae Linguae fuerunt pariti? quam pauca (ob librorum & fidelium praeceptorum inopiam) ad eam rem habuerunt auxilia, ex variis S. Hieronymis testimoniis apparet. Atque hinc factum est, ut à genuina Spiritus sancti sententia longius, praesertim in Veteri Testamento, laepius aberrarint. Nostris verò temporibus, Hebraei Graecique codices sunt in numeri & linguarum periti professores non pauci quorum beneficio ita sacrae literae illustratae sunt, ut quàm plurima, quae Patrum memoria erant obscura, luce clarius videantur. Gomari. Anti-Costerus, l. 2. c. 8. As we ought highly to reverence the Fathers for their Antiquity, so in our times we owe much respect to many famous Writers, because by their most learned La∣bours they have given great light to the right understanding of the holy Scripture. We have the same instruments which they had, viz. the holy Scriptures, and far greater help. Zuinglius, Luther, Calvin, all those learned men are to be loved and highly honoured, as those that have well deserved of the Church; their Books are also to be diligently read, and to be preferred before the Volumes of many of the Fa∣thers, as those which have more truly interpreted the minde of the holy Ghost then the Fathers, which have illustrated the Christian Doctrine brought out of darknesse with wonderfull perspicuity, have comprized it with wonderfull brevity,
and explained it in an excellent method. Zanch. Prolegom. in Esaiam. Ep. Andr Opusc. post de decimis. Some much approve of the Articles of Religion for Ireland.Illustres illi viri, nec unquam sine summa honoris praefatione nominandi, quorum Deus in religione restauranda, opera usus est. Upon the view of the Doctrine of the Church of England, compiled by them in the XXXIX Articles, translated into Latine in the dayes of King Edward the 6th, and sent abroad into the whole Christian world, it was said abroad, Puritas doctrinae viget in Anglia. Deresormationis Genevensis hi∣storica occasione. Vide Veidelii Epist Dedica. ad Commentarium De Tempore utrius{que} Episco∣patus S. Apostoli Petri.For the first ten years of Queen Elizabeth, most of the Papists of England came to our Churches, prayed our prayers, heard our Sermons, and received our Sa∣craments, untill by the instigation of the Jesuites, Pope Pius Quintus excommu∣nicated Queen Elizabeth, and enjoyned all the Papists not to resort to our Churches. So they did in Ireland till 88, some Spanish Priests then landing there, told them, it was condemned in the Councel of Trent. This is that Religion which (since the first Reformation of it, Anno 1. Edw. 6.) above one and twenty several Sessions of Parliament, as learned, as wise, as religious as ever were in this Kingdom,The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland appro∣veth the As∣semblies Con∣fession of faith for orthodox. have allowed and approved. Mr Baxter in his Confession of Faith, Sect 41. saith thus of the late Assembly of Divines at Westminster; I so highly reverence that Assembly, that I think this Nation since the Apostles dayes, had never any that excelled it for Piety and Abi∣lity: and Sect. 3. he much magnifies both the Confession of Faith, and the Short∣er Catechism put out by the Assembly. I truly professe (saith he, Sect. 5.) I take the Labours of the Assembly, especially these three Pieces (the Confession of Faith, the larger and lesser Catechism) for the best Books, next my Bible, in my study. What Kingdom in Europe is there which hath not yielded eminent Scholars, and famous Martyrs of the Reformed Religion. France had Calvin, Farel, Viret, Sadeel, Daneus, Marlorate, Beza, Mornee, Chamier, Rivet, Peter du Moulin, Daillè, and many others. Italy brought forth and cast out (because it was unworthy of them) Peter Mar∣tyr,Vide Pezel. Mellef. Histor. par. 3. pag. 438, 439, 440. de progressu Evangelii in Europa, & Sculteri concio∣nem secularem De Evangelii Doctrina. Zanchy, also Immanuel Tremelius, and Deodate. Spain had John Diaz, Austen Cacalla, and also other Martyrs. Germany had Luther, Melancthon, Joachim Camerarius and Chemnitius, Zuin∣glius, Oecolampadius, Martin Bucer, Wolfangus Capito, Caspar Hedio, Musculus, Hyperius, Foster, Avenarius, Mollerus, Pezelius. Helvetia had Bullinger, Gualter, Pellicane, Leo Judae, Aretius, Wolfius, Simler, Bibliander, Stuckius. England was fruitfull of Martyrs and great Scholars, Barns, Rogers, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridlie, Hooper, Philpot, Haux, Bradford, Juel, Rainolds, Whitaker, Fulk, Perkins, Morton, Davenant, Twisse, Prideaux, and divers others. Denmark brought forth Palladius, Hemmingius, and many others. Semomislaus Polonorum Rex, filium habuit coecum qui die quodam cum visum gratiâ divina reciperet, Rex ab ariolis, quid hoc sibi vellet. sciscitatus est; cui responderunt: sicut hic filius tuus gratia Deorum est illuminatus, sic per eum Polonia brevi illuminabitur: quod & paulò post per lucem Evangelii factum fuit. Miesco enim coecus mortuo patre baptizatus, & Christianus factus, ad veram Dei agnitionem pervenit, & idola omnia è Templis ejecit. Hic Rex pius instituit, ut dum E∣vangelium praelegitur, singuli virorum gladiis ad medium è vaginis depromtis testarentur, so propter Evangelium Christi ad mor∣tem usque decertare paratos esse. Wolfii Lect. memor. Cent. 10.Polonia brought forth Johannes à Lasco. Servavit te huc usque Deus, ut sicut Lutherus suae Germanias, Zuinglius suae Helvetiae, Calvinus suae Galliae, ita tu tuae Poloniae sis Apostolus. Zanch. Epist. l. 2. ad illum. Scotland was made famous by the Martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton, and by the Doctrine of John Knox, and Robert Rollock, Andrew Melvin, Cameron, Baronius, Forbes. This may suffice to answer that calumny of the Jesuites, as if the Protestants had no Scholars amongst them. The Papists call us Hereticks: This was ever an old and cunning trick of Pa∣pists, and their fore-fathers, if any did complain of their errours and faults, and desired to have true Religion restored, to condemn such for Hereticks, as men new∣fangled and factious.Bellarmin. lib. 4. de notis Eccl. cap. 4. They reproachfully nick-name us Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calvinists, whereas we
maintain not any private or proper Doctrine of theirs. They called us in England heretofore Lollards, either because they cried Lord, Lord unto their God,Nos inter haere∣ticos reponit, & dicit nos vocari Martinistas, Lutheranos, Zuinglianos, Calvinianos. Nos autem, inquit, ab aliquo certo homine nemo unquam voca∣vit. Notoriam injuriam nobis facit. Scit Lutherum quosvis graviter obtestatum esse ne suum usurpa∣rent nomen.

I will not rehearse the several opinions about the original of that word, because Heraldus a learned Frenchman saith, Vnde Huguenoti appellati fuerint, nec nos ad∣huc satis liquido scimus. Animad ad Arnob. adversus Gentes, l. 1. As the Jews were in times past called by the Gentiles Sabbatarians in contempt; the Christians Galile∣ans by Julian the Apostata, so now they which imbrace truth of Doctrine, began to be called Huguenots. They term us those of the pretended Reformed Religion, whereas it is truly Re∣formed according to the word of God. They acknowledge themselves to be Papists, and from the Pope, and glory in the title. Luther saith, Primum oro ut nomen meum taceatur, & nemo Lutheranus sed Chri∣stianus appelletur. They suffer Turks and Jews which deny and persecute Christ, but put to death those of the Reformed Religion who believe in Christ. They say, that the Heathens (which had no knowledge of Christ) by their mo∣rality may be saved, and yet deny that Protestants, who have a knowledge of Christ, and exceed them in their morality, may be saved. Marcus Antonius de Dominis Arch-bishop of Spalato said in the hearing of some of our Bishops, Before God, and Christ Jesus my Redeemer, I will acknowledge from my heart, and professe openly, That the Church of England is a true and or∣thodoxal Church of Christ. His shiftings in Religion. The Papists urge two things much against the Reformed Religion: 1. Our divisions and differences amongst our selves, as Fitz Simons in his Bri∣tannomachia ministrorum, in plerisque Fidei fundamentis, & Articulis dissiden∣tium. Secondly, The Novelty of our Religion, as if it were no ancienter then Lu∣ther. To the first, I might answer with Zanchy Epist. lib. 1. ad Dudith. Ausim equidem affirmare nullam essetantam inter Evangelicos in Doctrina de gratia & prade∣stinatione dissen∣sionem quam esscimer Jesui∣tas & Prado. terminantes, quorum nunc Jansenius An∣tesignanas esse videtur.Amyrald. de Successione ab Eccles. Rom. pag. 41. Mo dissidium aliud inter Evangelicos ortum est, nonidem omnibus de coena Domini sentientibus. Zuinglius enim Tiguri substantialem corporis Christi in coena Domini praesentiam negavit; quam Brentius cum Luthero & aliis adservit. Duravit id certamen magno cum scandalo doctrinae annis aliquot: Ac ne∣scio, an ulla res alia, magis causae obfuerit, cursumque doctrinae calestis impedierit, quam odiosum hoc à Satana excitatum bellum Sacramentarium: quod omnes pii doluerunt plurimum, & tollere atque componere studuerunt. Melch. Adam. in vita Brentii., That this is rather an Argument that we are the true Churches of Christ. For there are (saith he) three kindes of Churches, 1. Where God onely reigns without contradiction: This is the Triumphant Church in Heaven. 2. Where Satan only reigns: This is the Church of the wicked and Idolaters, such are the Turkish, Jewish, Popish Churches. 3. Where God truly reigns, but not without the snares and assaults of Satan. This is the true Church of Christ, which is called Militant. This alwayes fights with the flesh, the world, Hereticks, and the Devil. The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countreys, States and Kingdoms, where these Churches are, are now of late very profitably published, to the con∣viction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably distracted and
rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith. Travers answer to a Popish Treatise written to the LL. of the Councel. Amyraldus de Secessione ab Ecclesia Romana, pag. 67. saith, The chief controver∣sies inter Evangelicos, may be reduced to four heads, 1. Concerning the Nature of the Sacraments. Lavater hath written an History, De ortu & progressu controversiae Sacramentariae. See also his 3d Decad of Ep. epist. 6. he saith in that Epistle, There is not one point in all Divinity (except those wherein we accord with them) wherein they all speak the same.2. About the Person of Christ, and the Properies of both Natures in it. 3. How the Doctrine of Predestination is to be explained. 4. What is to be held concerning the Providence of God, especially as it is con∣versant about the ill actions of the reasonable creature, and shews there also how far yet they agree in all these. Dr Hall in his Peace of Rome, shews, That Bellarmine acknowledgeth and num∣bers up above three hundred differences of opinions maintained in the Popish Church, and that Navarre confesseth near threescore differences amongst their own Doctors in one only point of their Religion. There are many Sects risen since the Gospel was first published, but none are so guilty of division as the Papists, though they extoll their own Church for Unity. They unchurch all the Churches of Christ through the world besides themselves, the Greek Church and divers others. What a State were all former ages in before the Popes Supremacy was acknowledged? The pure and primitive times. The reading of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is condemned amongst them as a ca∣pital crime in Spain and Italy, but allowed in England and France. Albertus Pighius dissents from Cajetane, Thomas from Lombard, Scotus from Thomas, Occam from Scotus, Alliacensis from Occam. Their nominals disagree from their reals. What difference is there between the Franciscans and Dominicans concerning original sinne in the blessed Virgin.Cardinalis Ca∣meracensis, Gerson, Almain, Cusanus, Pa∣normitanus, Cardinalis Florentinus, Abalensis, & alii dicunt. Cathol. Conci∣lium esse supra Papam. Gerhard. Confes. lib. 1. General. part. 2. cap. 3. & 10. What difference among the Jesuites and other Papists, concerning Councels being above the Pope. The Jesuites hold, that the Pope is above a Councel. Bellarmine confesseth lib. 2. de Concil. cap. 17. parag. 1. that Proposition, That the Pope is absolutely above a Councel, is not simply de fide, and those are not Hereticks properly who hold the contrary. The Pope in two Councels (those of Constance and Basil) was declared to be in∣feriour to a Councel. Ubi suerit Ecclesia ante Lutherum? in qua orbis regione vel angulo latuerit.2. For the other Objection, of the Novelty of our Religion, as if it were no ancienter then Luther. I answer, there are books Lennards Luthers Fore∣runners. Birbecks Pro∣testants Evi∣dence.Quòd novam appellant no∣stram doctri∣nam, Deosunt vehementer in∣jurii, cujus sa∣crum verbum novitatis insimulari non merebatur. Illis quidom novam esse minime dubito, quibus & Christus novus est, & Evangelium novum: sed qui illam Pauli concionem veterem esse noverunt, Jesum Christum mortuum pro∣pter peccata nostra, resurrexisse propter Justificationem nostram, Rom. 4.25. Nihil apud nos deprehendent notum.

Nos novatores non sumus, sed vos estis veteratores, said Scaliger. Ac ferme verum est quod quidam magni nominis Theologi prodiderunt, omnia quae vera sunt, & quae nos cre∣dimus, eadem à Papistis agnosci: sed addi insuper falsa alia, quorum quadam sunt talia, ut cum primis illis agnitis veris non possiut consistere unde sequitur, reducta religione ad ea in quae omnes Christianae Ecclesiae omnium temporum consentiunt, collabi Papisutum, ut qui conflatus fit ex privatis opiniobus. Wal. Epist. Antonio Walaeo. Hugo Grotius. Peter du Moulin in his Anatomy De la messe. l. 1. ch. 22. & 23. speaks sufficiently to this Objection. written to refute this calumny. The Waldenses for divers hundred years before Luther successively opposed Po∣pery, professed the truth of the Gospel, and sealed it with their bloud. Campian in his third reason cals them Majores nostros. Vide Gerhard. Epist. Ded. ad Confess. Cathol. Illyricus in his Catalogus Testium veritatis, and Wolfius in his Lectiones Memora∣biles, & Reconditae. And Gerhard in his Confessio Catholica sufficiently refute this Objection. Errours often lie hid under the venerable Cloak of ancient custom, Matth. 5.21, 27, 31, 33, 38, 43. But on the contrary sound and orthodox Doctrine is undeserved∣ly taxed with the crime of novelty, Mark 1.27. Act. 17.19. therefore judgement is to be made of both by Scripture, Act 17.11.
Secondly, We may retort this Question on them, Where was your Religion be∣fore the Councel of Trent? Cardinal Contarenus holding the same with us for substance in point of Justifi∣cation, and many of those learned and modest men which are reckoned for Papists, groaning under the corruptions of their Church, and desiring a Reformation of many abuses as well as we. Bishop Jewels challenge of the Papists is commonly known,Nous sommes prests de sabir toute sorte de punitions, si en cinq cens ans apres Jesus Christ, & (pourrious descendre plusbas) il se trouve un seul homme qui ait en une Religion tant soit peu approchante de la Religion Romaine telle qu' elle est auiourhui. Anatomie de la Messe par Pierre du Moulin. l. 1. ch. 22. with which Peter du Moulin also accords. There is rather a conspiracy amongst the Papists then true union: as on the con∣trary, the difference amongst us is rather a diversity then a division, in circumstances or things of lesse moment, and among persons rather then generally. We are reproached beyond Sea for our unsettlement in matters of Religion, and for the diversity of opinions and sects now in the Land. Some amongst our selves also will be ready to object, That there are so many religions and opinions, that they know not which course to take. 1. Such should therefore take the Scripture onely for the rule of their faith and life. 2. They should study faithfully to know the plain meaning of the Scripture, they should reade it diligently, seek Gods direction, come to it not with forestalled con∣ceits, but with love of the truth. 3. They should resolve to obey what they shall finde upon such diligent inquiry to be the plain minde of God beyond dispute. They should practice what all Chri∣stian Sects agree in, they all confesse that God is above the creature, and to be pre∣ferred before it, that the pleasures and profits of this world are far short of the glo∣ry to come. CHAP. VII. Of the Syncretisme of Religion, or of a friend∣ly Reconciliation of the different parties amongst themselves.I met with this Question in the Archbi∣shop of Canter∣buries Manu∣script. Cata∣logue.An hoc tempore gliscentis vel po∣tiùs grassantis tyrannidis Pon∣tificiae Syncre∣tismus & coitio fieri inter Ec∣clesias Evange∣licas de Coena Domini dissi∣dentes adversus communem ho∣stem debeat. Disputatio 4to. Vidae Hottonis De Christiana Tolerantia, Tract. Sect. 3. cap. 3. THey are Christians which professe Christian Religion, therefore those which either know not Christ, as the Pagans, or deny him to be the Savi∣our of the world, as the Mahometans, or that contemn and blaspheme him, as the Jews, are excluded. There are several opinions about this matter: The first is, of those who hold, That whosoever they be who differ about Reli∣gion so they be Christians, they may and ought to be reconciled and agree together in an Ecclesiastical Syncretism, so the Socinians, Libertines, Polititians, Machi∣villians. The second opinion is of those which denieth that Christians differing in Religion can or ought to be so reconciled. So the Papists, especially the Jesuites, think and teach, requiring a full consent with the Church of Rome, as that which cannot erre, and out of which there is no salvation, and cannot, nor will not bear these which differ. Hence it is a common speech amongst them, there is no other way to agreement, then by the receiving and approving of the Councel of Trent.
Many of those which professe to follow Luther, are of that opinion also, refu∣sing to joyn with those which they reproachfully call Calvinists, unlesse they will receive the Augustane Confession, as it is wont to be explained by them, and the book of Concord. Calvin in his Epistles speaks of his crossing the Seas wil∣lingly, to re∣concile the differences between the Reformed Churches: And King James sent to Peter du Moulin to come over hither into England to conferre with him about the method that it was fit to take for the reunion of all the Reformed Churches in Christendom, so often sollicited by Mounsieur du Plessis, See La Vie du M. du Plessis, lib. 3. pag. 403, 404. and his Memoires. Others also have laboured this way. Quid? Nonne vident dissidia nostra esse amicorum dispendia, hostium compenaia (ut cùm Hieronymo dicam) & publica irae divinae incendia. Junii praefat. ad Irenicum.The third opinion is of them who go the middle way between these extreams, and affirm, That there may be an agreement among those that differ in some Con∣troversies, but not in others, These are the Orthodox Teachers of the Reformed Churches. A universal conjunction is impossible, the rule of consent about Religion is only the word of God. The enemies of Christian Religion are twofold, Open or Close: Those openly oppose the Doctrine of Christ, and persecute his Church, viz. the Heathens, Mahometans and Jews; these treacherously and under the name of Christ, as Hereticks, but especially Arminians, Pelagians, and Pa∣pists. Altingius and others hold an agreement with both these unlawfull. 1 King. 13.21.To endeavour to soder different Religions and persons holding to their principles will make up but a medly and patcht Religion. Dum Geor∣gius Cassan∣der Papatum reformare si∣mulat: stabi∣lit & commen∣dat aeque, ac aporti hostes. Melch. Adam. in vita Ur∣sini.As some in the Apostles time mingled Circumcision with Baptism, and the Sa∣crifices with the death of Christ. This was the way which the great Emperour Charles the fifth took to reunite the two Religions in Germany, by the Tract called the Interim, which was composed by an Apostate Minister named Islebius. But it was opposed by the faithfull Ministers, and although out of fear it was admitted by some Princes and Commonwealths, yet it was soon abolisht. Circa idem tempus, monstrosus partus & toti Germaniae pestilens in lucem infelici sidere prodiit, quem In∣terim seu inter Religionem Augustanam, nominarunt, cum edicto Caesaris: quo pro∣mulgata est certa quaedam Religionis formula, interim servanda; donec universali Concilio ceacto, Religionis controversiae cognoscantur & tollantur.

Some distinguish between Consent, and Concord, others make a difference between Consent,Differunt Con∣sensio & Con∣cordia: Haec enim Charitate, Pace, & sa∣crorum Com∣munione con∣stat: illa opinio∣num Consonan∣tia. Perfecta Theologorum aut Ecclesia∣rum in omnibus Consensio optanda potius quam speranda in hac vita Attamen etiam cum imperfecta judiciorum Consenfione potest esse vera, & pro hujus vitae modulo plena ac per ecta Concordia Rom. 14. Phil. 3.15, 16. Forbes. Instruct. Historico-Theol. lib. 14. cap. 7. Concord and Peace. Consent we call Unity in judgement; Concord, Unity of will and desire, peace, quiet and calme conversation, a life void of janglings, and free from tumults. There may be Consent without Concord; Concord without Consent, and Peace without both. Men may agree in their opinion, and yet differ in their de∣sires; they may differ in opinion and desires, yet live in peace. That there should be a mutual amity and forbearance amongst those, who differ in matters of Church-Government, or the like, but agree in the Fundamentals is most reasonable. It is a Question, An Ecclesia Protestantium conciliari possit cum Pontificiis? Whether the Church of the Protestants may be reconciled with the Pa∣pists?Non aliter sin∣cera & cum essectu aliquo hono peragenda poterit praecede∣re Conciliatio. Ante omniae Papa removea∣tur, aut in ordinem Episcoporum redigatur, ut supra eos nihil amplius habeat potestatem praeter primatum ordinis, sed omnes inter se pares sint, ut ab initio introducti in Ecclesiam Episcopatus fuere. Ubi sic exequati fuerint postmodum etiam amove∣antur omnes, non enim potest statim, & uno saltu omnium Reformatio perfici, & reducatur regimen Presbyterale, quale ab Apostolis ex Christi praecepto institutum fuerit, ne iterum resurgere inde tyrannis Ecclesiae posset rediviva, quae originem ab Episcopatu cepit, & in eo radices habet. Reducantur Sacramenta ad antiquum numerum, usum & modum, ut à Christo li∣quet instituta fuisse, ab Apostolis esse celebrata, & à primitivae Ecclesiae hominibus per aliquot saecula observata, Doctrina etiam de his vetus restituatur. Simplicii Verini Judicium de lib. Posthum. Grotii p. 40, 41. Roma irreconciliabilis was Dr Hall's tenet.
Franciscus de Sancta Clara, Cassander, the Archbishop of Spalato, and Milli∣tier, and other Conciliators there have been, but all in vain. Gentilettus in his Preface to his Apologia pro Christianis Gallis Religionis Reforma∣tae, saith well, Imprimis hoc verissimum esse statuo, inter Catholicos Romanos & E∣vangelicos Religionis Reformatae, in multi dogmatum Articulis, & quidem praecipuis magnam esse contrarietatem. Nihilominus tamen in hoc omnes conveniunt, ut agnos∣cant & profiteantur veritatem personae Iesu Christi in duabus naturis non confusis, nec non sanctam Trinitatem Patris, Filii & Spiritus sancti: amplectanturque omnes sanctam Scripturam Veteris & Novi Testamenti. Though the Papists and we agree in these things, that we both acknowledge the Unity of the Person of Christ in two Natures not confounded, and the Trinity of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, and all the holy Scripture of the Old and New Testament, yet in many Articles of Religion we much differ, and chiefly in the Doctrine of Justification. Vide Whitak. de notis Eccles. Some make the great difference between the Papists and us to be about the cor∣poral presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and the Infallibility of the Pope. It is a Question, An cura Religionis ad Magistratum Civilem pertineat?Christs insti∣tutions are of his own ap∣pointment, yet the Magi∣strate hath a Ministerium, though not an Imperium here. He cannot make a Law, that this or that shall be a religious ser∣vice, but he may reform and purge, and also preserve Religion. An sanè olim Imperatores Christiani, res quae ad Religionem pertinebant ad suam curam revocare sole∣bant, piis{que} legibus doctrinam disciplinam{que} erroribus repurgare, ut purae integraeque in Ecclesia remanerent. Debet enim Princeps, Justiniano Principeteste, majorem euram habere eorum quae ad animae salutem pertinent, quàm Civilium Gentil. Exam. Conc. Trid. lib. 4. Sess. 22. Vide Gerh. Confess. Cathol. contra Pontis. l. 2. Special. partem 2dam. Artic. 8. De Officio Magistratus in negotio Religionis. Whether any thing of Religion come under the Magistrates Cognizance, or belong to his care? That it doth, appears First, From the Nature of Christianity, it goes through his whole conversation, 1 Pet. 1.15. and reacheth to all his relations. A Heathen Magistrate or Parent is as truly a Magistrate and Parent, as a Christian Magistrate or Parent. Christianity gives no farther power but a higher Law. The name of Christianity lies in exercising it in all our relations. Secondly, The Gospel is given for Nations, and is their great priviledge that receive it Magistrates ought to take care of all National priviledges, Rev. 11.15. Thirdly, That which God hath promised to his people as a mercy, Ma∣gistrates should labour to be, and fulfill in duty, Isa. 49.22. Psal. 2.11. It is a great Question, An Magistratus plures Religiones in una republica tolerare debeat?Tolerantia di∣versarum Reli∣gionum quam perniciosa rei∣publicae, so Mr Fox in his printed Com∣monplaces. Jactabimusne libertatem Con∣scientiis per∣mittendam esse minimè, & hac quidem libertas intelligitur, id est, ut quo quisque modo volet Deum colat. Est enim hoc merè Diabolicum dogma; sinendum esse unumquemque ut si volet pereat. Et illa est Diabolica libertas quae Poloniam & Transylvaniam bodiè tot postibus implevit, qua nullae alioqui sub sole regiones tolerarent. Bezae Epist. 1. Whether it be lawfull for a Magistrate to tolerate many Religions in one Commonwealth? Some give this distinction in the Doctrine of Toleration. They put a difference inter Toleration & approbationem, a Magistrate must dis∣countenance all corrupt Doctrines, and before hand, Dissensum suum publicè de∣clarare debet. Religio non potest cogi, Religion cannot be constrained, and yet blasphe∣phemies must be restrained. See Revel. 2.20. Hereticks should sure not be advan∣ced to high places. Toleration (intolerable Tolerationem) is the great Diana much cried up in these times.
Some think there is no love among men, unlesse they allow an universal Tole∣ration of all blasphemies and heresies; We must distinguish between loving of mens persons and their errours, Ephes. 4.15. 2 Joh. v. 1, & 3. We should joyn grace and truth, and charity together. Some give these Cautions: First, If they be such Religions as do not overthrow the foundation. Secondly, Nor such as disturb the Government established in the State or Kingdom. Thirdly, If the Professors thereof be not factious, ambitious, or pertinacious, but honest, simple, tractable, obedient to their Superiours. Some say, Take heed of two destroying extreams: First, That of the Libertines, that all should be tolerated without limita∣tion. Secondly, Others, who would have liberty for none but themselves, and men of their own opinion. For the Papists; They are not tolerated in Holland; The Jews are not only to∣lerated,Les Catholiques seut les seuls exclus de la grace univer∣selle, dont tous les autres jo∣uissent, & n' ont aucun exercice libre du tout, quoy que leur nombre ne soit pas petit, & que ceux qui suivent cette Religion, soyent pour la plus part urais Hollandois & d' ancienne extraction, Les Delices De La Hollande Premiere, partie Chapitre xxiv. but have the publick exercise of their Religion, and their Synagogues, viz. at Amsterdam. I shall not need (I hope) to say much against their Toleration, the thing is so grosly evil, and of that dangerous consequence to a Protestant State. Dr Downam Bishop of Derry preaching before the Lord Deputy and the State at Christ Church in Dublin in Ireland, Novemb. 26. 1626. produced the judgement of four and twenty Bishops (whereof only now the most reverend Primate of Ar∣magh is living) against it. Whose reasons I shall here insert. First, It is to make our selves accessory not only to the Papists Superstitions, Ido∣latry, Heresies, and in a word, to all their abominations of Popery, but also (which is a consequence of the former) to the perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the deluge of the Catholick Apostasie. Secondly, To grant them a Toleration in respect of money to be given, or con∣tribution to be made by them, is to set Religion to sale, and withall the souls of the people, whom Christ our Saviour hath redeemed with his most precious bloud: And as it is a great sinne, so it is matter of most dangerous consequence; and be∣seeching God to make all in Authority zealous of Gods glory, and the Advance∣ment of the true Religion, resolute and couragious against all Popery, Super∣stition and Idolatry, he said, Let all the people say, Amen, which they did with a loud acclamation. It is a Question propounded by HelvicusSystem Con∣trovers. Theolog. Quae Christia∣nis cum Judaeis intercedunt. Elench. Jud. 8. & ult. Profecto excu∣sari Magistratus Christianus non potest, si impunè eorum blasphemias horrendas in Christum, & S S. Trinitatem, totamque Religionem Christianam, diutiùs oculo connivente toleret. Id. ibid. Amongst Gregories Epistles, there is one De Judaeis non persequendis., An Judaei à Magistratu Christiano tole∣randi, & quomodo tractandi? Whether the Jews be to be tolerated by the Christian Magistrate, and how they are to be handled? He saith it is a perplex Question by reason of the different judgements. He propounds first divers Arguments of those which hold they are altogether to be cast out of a Christian Commonwealth by reason of those horrible blasphe∣mies, which daily both in their ordinary prayers, and in their speeches they belch out against Christ, the Virgin Mary, our faith, and all Christians in general, and for other reasons which he there alledgeth. Secondly, He urgeth other Arguments, to prove, that the Jews are not to be cast out, but tolerated under the Christian Magistrate, because by that means many of them may be converted by continual converse with the Christians, and the Scripture seems evidently to confirm that, Hosea 3.4. Zephany 3.7. Luke 21.24. Romans 11.25, 26. And because they may be serviceable
to them against the Pagans, and for other reasons. He himself goes the middle way, and layes down his opinion in certain Propo∣sitions: First, It is better for Jews to live amongst Christians, then under Turks or In∣fidels. Secondly, The blasphemies of Jews are not to be tolerated, but to be prohibited and most severely punished by Christians. Thirdly, The Jews are to be esteemed among Christians as the servants of ser∣vants, that is so to be handled, that they are exiles and cast off by God himself. They are not to have any publick office. They are not to practise that unjust Usury, for which they are so infamous amongst Christians. They are to have also (said he) some outward mark in their garments, by which they may be distinguish∣ed from others, and to be forced to hear Sermons. Many other Cautions doth he give in the receiving of them. As for the Toleration of the Jews, whosoever they be that suffer the exercise of their Religion, with the blasphemies they commonly use against Christ, make themselves guilty of all their wickednesse, which the Lord keep this Land from, as well as from the abomination of the Masse. The Pope can tolerate the blasphemy of the Jews, and the filthinesse of all the Curtisans and Stews, and take a yearly rent of them for it, and for no respect will allow the exercise of our most holy Re∣ligion, either in his own Dominions, or wheresoever he may prevail against us.

THE SECOND BOOK OF Learning. CHAP. I. I. Of the Dignity and Excellency of Learning. THere are three kindes of things to be desired, One, That which draws us to it self by its own force, Non emolumento captans alique, sed trahens sua dignitate; as Virtue, Know∣ledge and Truth. 2. Another, which is desired for fruit and profit, as money. A third, which draws us both by its own force and dignity, and by profit, the more to desire it, as friendship, and a good Name.Eccles. 2.13. Quemadmo∣dum ratione homines à re∣liquis animan∣tibus, ita & li∣teris homines ipsi ab homini∣bus differunt. Qui igitur scribendo in commune bo∣num aliquid proferrepotest, is quidem prae∣star, quod pau∣corum est praestare, propterea quod non omnium sit literas discere aut docere: tanto autem majore laude dignior est, quanto rarior est literarum scientia, quam aliarum vulgarium artium quibus humana vira continetur. Scalig. Proleg. in Canon Chronol Isag. Eruditio, plebeiis argenti: nobilibus aeuri: principibus gemmarum instar est. Gryn. Epist. l. 1. Epist. 14. Ut ager quamvis fertilis, sine cultura fructuosus esse non poreit: sic sine doctrina animus. Cultura autem animi eruditio est, quae praeparat animos ad satus accipiendos, eáque mandat iis, & (ur ita dicam) serit, quae adulta fructus uberrimos ferant. Citra cultum eruditionis non potest homo revera esse▪ quod audit. Coelii Sec. Cur. orat. De ingenuis artibus. Learning is the perfection of reason, it was so prized by the Heathens, that they thought a learned man to differ as much from an unlearn∣ed, as a man from a beast. Humane Learning delivers the minde from wildenesse and barbarism. Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter Artes. Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros. Ovid. de Pont. Artibus ingennis, quarum tibi maxima cura est, Pectora mollescunt, asperitas que fugit. Ovid. ad Gracinum. Nemo adeo ferus est qui non mitescere possit; Si modo culturae patientem accommodet aurem. Horat.
But the accent had need be put upon fideliter (as Sir Francis Bacon well ob∣serves) for a superficial knowledge doth rather work a contrary effect. Ego benè literatos viros eo benigniores candidioresque semper expertus sim, quo magis & ingenio & eruditione polleront. Pier. Valer. Hieroglyph. lib. 23. cap. 4. He instanceth there in Pontanus, Antonius Sabellicus, Pomponius Latus, and shews how candid and cour∣teous they were to all, and concludes, Jacobi Sadoleti nomen aetate nostra in modestiae a∣biit appellationem. How much more effectual is divine learning? Esa. 11.9. Secondly, It mitigates the fear of death and adversity. If a mans minde be sea∣soned with the contemplation of mortality, and the corruptible nature of things, he will be ready to concurre with Epictetus, who going forth one day, saw a wo∣man weeping for her pitcher of earth; and going forth the next day, he saw ano∣ther weeping for her sonne, said, Heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodiè vidi mortalem mori. Thirdly, The pleasure and delight of Knowledge and Learning far surpasseth all other pleasure and delight; Therefore the Egyptians, Caldeans, Grecians, Ro∣mans, have so highly prized humane wisdome, that they were willing to undergo any labour or cost for the purchasing of it. Dr Halls 4th Decad of Epist. Epist. 3.To finde wit in Poetry, in Philosophy profoundnesse, in Mathematicks acute∣nesse, in History wonder of events, in Oratory sweet eloquence, in Divinity su∣pernatural light and holy devotion, as so many rich medals in their proper mines, whom would it not ravish with delight?

Excellent to this purpose is that of Seneca, Nomen Attici perire Ciceronis Epi∣stolae non sinunt: Nihil illi profuisset gener Agrippa, & Tiberius progener, & Dru∣sus Caesar pronepos; inter tam magna nomina taceretur, nisi Cicero illum apernisset. Seneca Epist. 21. Homers verses continued five and twenty Centuries of years and above, without the losse of a syllable or letter. Vox audita perit, litera scripta manet. The use of a good Book reacheth farre and lasteth long. Many more are instru∣cted by Books then can be by speech, and every good thing is better by how much it more communicates it self. By Books we have conference with learned men de∣ceased, and by these they instruct us as much as they did those with whom they li∣ved together. Fifthly, As the ignorance of the people, and the Authority of the Roman Sea increased together,Melch. Adam. in vit. Germ. Theol. & Gentilet. Exam. Concil. Trid. l. 1. Hoc nostro saeculo, ab anno M.

Gentiles. Exam. Conc. Trid. l. 1. so by the restoring of Arts and Learning, both ignorance, and the Authority of the Pope of Rome decreased. What did Reuchline, Erasmus, Pagnine, Arias Montanus, and others (though in other things Popish) suffer, for no other reason, but because they did labour to propagate the knowledge of the Tongues. So sad was the face of those times, Vt in authoribus lati∣nis Graecè nosse suspectum fuerit: Ebraicè autem propè hareticum. Espenc. ad 2 Tim. 3.

The ancient Greek and Roman Princes were learned, and by it their Noblemen were advanced to great honour.

Bocharti Geog. Sac. l. 2. c. 16. Languages, Arts and Sciences are great helps to the attaining of knowledge in Divinity. 1. A competent knowledge of the Languages, at least of the three learned ones, Hebrew, Greek and Latine, is very convenient, if not necessary, for one that would be a compleat Divine; Such see with their own eyes. The knowledge and interpretation of Tongues is a very great gift of God, pro∣mised by him in times past, Esa. 19.18. bestowed by Christ, attributed to the holy Ghost, Acts 2. Paul commends the study of Languages to the Church and all its members, 1 Cor. 14. He which shall professe to be an absolute learned Divine without the knowledge of three tongues at the least, may think well of himself, but hardly he shall get and retain the credit he seeketh among learned men in this learned age.

Sixt. Am. Paraen. de excitandis SS. Linguarum studiis. But saith Mr Webster in his Academiarum Examen Pag. 6., It is not yet infallibly con∣cluded which are the true original Copies (especially concerning the Hebrew and the oriental Languages) the Jewish tongue having been often altered and corrupt∣ed by their several intermixtures with, and transmigrations into other Nations, or that they have been purely and sincerely preserved unto our hands. For Langua∣ges change and alter as fashions and garments; Neither have we any thing to assure us in this point, but bare tradition and history, which are various, perplex, dubious, contradictory and deficient. To this I answer, Who (but the ignorant) deny that the Hebrew Copies are the Original of the Old Testament. Were not the Scriptures of the Old Testament committed to the Jews? And was not the Hebrew the Jewish language? In∣deed the Jews by their Captivity in Babylon learned the Chaldee tongue, and so some of the Old Testament, as Ezra and Daniel were written in that lan∣guage. Secondly, What if the Jewish tongue hath been often altered and corrupted, and generally languages change and alter like fashions and garments? Is that any rea∣son why we should doubt of the sincerity of the Hebrew Copies? By this reason we must question the works of Demonsthenes, Cicero, and generally all others, be∣cause the languages wherein they wrote was since altered. Thirdly, Is there nothing but bare tradition and History to inform us of the ori∣ginals, when as the originals themselves are extant before our eyes? And we may know them to be sincere, because generally all Copies throughout the world, though written at several times in several places do accord.
He objects further, Pag. 7. Knowledge of Tongues can but teach the Gramma∣tical Construction, signification and interpretation of words, propriety of phra∣ses, deduction of Etymologies, and such like; all which tend to no farther then the instamping of a bare literal understanding, and all this may be, the my∣stery of the Gospel being unknown, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit gi∣veth life. To this I answer with Melancthon,Scriptura non potest intelligi Theologicè nisi prius in∣telligatur Grammaticè. Melancth. If we understand not the signification of the words, how can we know the things signified by them? Whereas he opposeth tongues, and the Spirit, Subordinata non pugnant, If he will so rely on the Spirit, as utterly to exclude tongues, Why doth he make use at least of his mother-tongue for the understanding of the Scriptures? He saith there, He that understands the original tongues, in which the Text was written, conceives no more of the minde of God thereby, than he that only can reade or hear read the Translation in the mother-tongue. Yes, because the minde of God is primarily in the Original, and but secondarily in the Translation, in that the Translation is out of the Original, and doth no further contain in it the Word of God, then it doth agree with the Original. He addes yet further, What difference is there between him that relies upon his Teachers skill, and he that relies upon the skill of a Translator, are they not both alike, since they are but both Testimonia humana, full of errours, mistakes and fallacies? It is much that he cannot perceive a difference between these two: He that relies upon the skill of a Translator, relies upon it for that particular Translation which he doth make use of: but he that relies upon the skill of his Teacher onely, relies upon it for his general knowledge of the language which is taught him besides, no man hath need so wholly to rely on his Teachers skill, having many other means to know whether his Teacher rightly instruct him or no, as some have to rely on the skill of a Translator, p. 7. But he proceeds. The errours and mistakes that still remain, and are daily discovered in all Transla∣tions, do sufficiently witnesse mens negligence and ignorance, that in the space of sixteen hundred years, have not arrived at so much perfection, as to compleat one Translation. This very reason which he alleadgeth against the knowledge of Tongues,Et sancta He∣braea est lin∣gua, & cuivis Theologiae studioso ne∣cessaria. Etsi enim monu∣menta Aposto∣rum & Evan∣gelistarum Graeca sunt: tamen phrasis est Hebraica. Itaque rectè dixerunt vete∣res: Hebraeos bibere ex fonti∣bus: Graecos ex rivulis: Latinos ex lacunis. Melch. Adam. in vita Graseri. Paulus linguarum genera tenere donum purat Spiritus Sancti, nos adeò ridemus, ut vix homine putemus dignum? Paulus divinationis muneri, vel anteponit, nos Sophisticis etiam nugis postponimus? Paulus gratias agit Deo, cujus beneficio tantum sibi bonum contigerit, nos eos, qui nobis tantum bonum etiam domi desidentibus è longinquo adferunt, circulatores vocitamus, & indignis modis tractamus? Pet. Mosell. Orat. de var. Ling. Cognit. Vide Crines. De Confus. Ling. cap. xi & xii. doth shew the necessity of it. For if errours and mistakes do still remain, and are daily discovered in all Translations, Is there not the more need of skill in the Originals, that so we may not be carried away with those errours and mistakes? And how should those errours in Translations be discovered but by skill in the Originals. But suppose that no mans skill in the Originals is so great, as to free him from errours and mistakes in translating, is therefore all his skill to no purpose? By the same reason all Mr Websters preaching should be in vain, because he is not infalli∣ble, but sometimes may mistake the meaning of the Scripture which he ci∣teth. I suppose it therefore very profitable for a Divine (which I think was Reverend Mr Wheatleys usual practice) to reade daily a Chapter in the Old Testament in He∣brew, and in the New Testament in Greek. Illud enim volo, Theologiae studioso & verbi Dei ministro tantum semper debere esse à rebus aliis otii, ut quotidiè caput aliquod in utriusque Testam. Originali Textu le∣gat, & quidem cum brevi succinctoque Commentario, vel Junii, vel Bezae, vel Piscat. vel Vatabli. Sixt. Amam. Consilium de studio Ebraico feliciter instituendo. Secondly, The Knowledge of the Arts is also very requisite for a Di∣vine.
Therefore Licinius and Julian envying such a good to the Church of Christ used their endeavours to deprive the Christians of the studies of them, most vain sports being set up in their room. Christ at first (to shew the glory of his greatnesse) took and imployed Fisher∣men, such as had no bringing up in Schools. But it was not long after, but learn∣ed men came in apace. Learned men of all sorts, Zenas in Law, Tit. 3.13. Luke in Physick, 1 Tim. 4.11. Apollo with his Eloquence, Act. 18.24. Dionyse with his Philosophy,Urbs Tarsus clara Schola & Academia à Strabone cele∣brata lib. 14. Divi Pauli patria. Neand. Geog. part. 2. Act. 17.34. Paul with his much learning, Act. 26.24. which he had at Tharsus, as famous an University for Asia, as Athens was for Greece. See 1 Cor. 14.18. Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Aegyptians, Act. 7.22. which Nation was one of the most ancient Schools of the world. Salomon passed all the children of the East in their own learning, 1 King. 4.30. Daniel was brought up, and well seen in the cunning of the Chaldeans, Dan. 1.4. First, All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in the Scripture, of natural and moral Philosophy,Numerorum imperitia mul∣ta facit non intelligi, tran∣slatè ac mysticè posita in Scripturis. Ac numerum & musicam plerisque in locis ac sanctis Scripturis posita, ho∣norabiliter invenimus. August. lib. 2. de doct. Christ. cap. 16. & 38. Melancthon linguarum & artium studia com∣paravit Cophinis, in quibus fragmenta panum colligi & reponi jubebantur, Matth. 14 v. 20. Cum sint adminicula, per quae doctrina coelestis commodè tradi, ad posteros propagari & contra adversarios propugnari possit. Gerh. Meth. Stud. I heol. of the Politicks, of Poetry, of History, of Ma∣thematicks, Metaphysicks, and many of them in that one Book of Job. How shall a Minister be able without some skill in Logick to analyze his Text? The whole Scripture abounds with Arguments, the strength of which one cannot perceive but from Logick, and how shall he be able to discover or confute the so∣phistry and false reasoning of Hereticks without it. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 18. Of the use of Logick in Divinity, See Mr Gataker against Saltmarsh, Shadows without Substance, p. 20. He may draw likewise excellent sentences, famous examples, profitable precepts from History and Philosophy. The Scripture is full of Metaphors and figurative speeches which have profit as well as ornament. A great part of the whole 6th of John is framed of such speech∣es, how shall one understand the meaning of such places without some skill in Rhetorick? Secondly, The knowledge of the Arts is requisite for a Divine to refute errors. Chronologia & Geographia principem sibi locum vendi∣cant in Theo∣logia quia in sacris literis continetur praeter fidei morumque praecepta, etiam Ecclesiae historia. Est autem olim dictum, Histo∣riae oculos esse Chronologiam & Geographi∣am. Haec terrarum ambitum describens, locos judicat quibus singula gesta, adeóque quasi in rem praesentem de∣ducit. Illa verò annorum saeculorumque seriem explicat. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib. 2. c. 18.The Socinians begin in Philosophical principles, and the Papists begin in Logick about accidents, when they would establish their Transubstantiation. Zanch. de Tribus Elohim parte altera, cap. 1. reckons up this as one cause of heresie, viz. the ignorance of true and solid Philosophy and Logick, and the Li∣beral Arts. How many Chronological difficulties are there in the Scripture, which will not be resolved without some skill in Chronology. Compare 1 King. 6.1. with Acts 13.20. 2 Kings 24.10. with 2 Chron. 36.9. 2 Chron. 22.2. with 21.20. Some say the holy Ghost did obscure some things in Chronology to sharpen mens wits. Object. Colos. 2.8. Beware least any man spoil you through Phylosophy and vain deceit, , i.e. through the vain deceit of Philosophy, for either it did promise eternal life, or did not shew the true and certain way which led thither. So Grotius. Some think he bids them beware of Plato's Philosophy, not of Philosophy in general, Neque Apostolus ad Colossenses veram & naturalem Philosophiam, sed ina∣nem duntaxat & deceptricem damnavit. Zanch. ad Arianum Respons. The learning of the Magi (who were skilled in the Stars and Bodies Celestial)
hindred them not in their coming to Christ. The gold and spoils of Egypt, did the Tabernacle no hurt, which was hung all over with them. Humane Learning may be lawfully used in a divine exercise,Some think it is a childish thing for a Minister to use exotick language in a popular Audi∣tory from 1 Cor. 14, 20. four conditions be∣ing observed. The first concerns the end, the confirmation of faith, not vain-glory. Secondly, If the prophanenesse or Ethnicisme in them be castrated, as Deut. 21. Thirdly, That we alwayes so use humane learning as we give the Scripture the upper-hand. Fourthly, That these citations of humane Writers, be used not as meat,Vide Sculteti Orationem De Conjun∣genda Philo∣logiam cum Thelogia. We are debters (saith Paul) to the learned and unlearned. Zanchius in his second Oration, De con∣servando in Ecclesia puro puro Dei verbo, shews, That there are only three necessary causes which happen but seldom, for a good Preacher; extra limites S. literarum, per scripta Poetarum & Philosophorum, aut etiam Patrum evagari, either by reason of the obstinacy of hereticks, which being not satisfied with the Scriptures, are to be convinced with other rea∣sons and testimonies, or for the calumnies of the malevolent, which it is necessary to refell with other testimonies then those of the Scriptures; or lastly, by reason of the infirmity of some weak brethren, which cannot be wholly divorced from their old superstition, and be setled in the truth delivered, unlesse the same be also confirmed by the testimonies of the ancient Fathers. The Apostle Paul thrice indeed citeth the sayings of profane Poets, because they were fit for the matter which he handled, but he neither names the Poets, neither did he do it often (saith he) nor without good reason, but only mentions some short speeches of theirs, seldom, soberly, and as it were obiter, being compelied thereto, that the Gentiles by the sayings of Gentiles might be convinced. Therefore the Fathers do not so use the sayings of Philosophers and Poets in their Homilies to the Church, as in their disputations and books against the Heathens. but as sauce, sparingly. Dr Chalon. Serm. on Tit. 1.13. Philosophandum est sed paucis. Humane knowledge or learning is abused: First, When we rest in it, lean not to thine own understanding, when we think to look into divine mysteries with the spectacles of nature. Secondly, When we boast of it as our chiefest excellency, Jer. 9.23. Religion is the highest excellency, the truest wisdom is that whereby we know and enjoy the chiefest good. Thirdly, When we oppose learning to the wisdom of Scripture, and confine God to the Laws of nature, 1 Cor. 1.23. Fourthly, The naked Theory of divine knowledge, idle and unactive know∣ledge, all knowledge is for practice, Prov. 14.8. Psal. 111.10. Deut. 4.6. Prov. 8.30. Some times are more favourable to learning then others. About the time of our Saviours coming, curious Arts, and other civil Disci∣plines did most flourish. The Grecians sought after wisdom, and secular Philoso∣phy, the Romans after Policy, State-knowledge and Discipline of wars. All the world almost (above others, those parts wherein Christianity was first placed) was then set upon curious Arts, yet the study and search of Scriptures in a short time devoured all, and brought them to acknowledge allegiance unto it. Dr Jacks. Comment on the Creed Vol. 1. l 1. c. 3. Wolfius in his Lectiones Memorabiles mentions the learned men of every Cen∣tury. Superstition and ignorance both together at the latter end of the ninth Century, as a thick mist dangerously invaded and possessed the Church, when the forging of Legends and Relicks, and such like trumpery was as common and highly esteem∣ed as the Scripture, and preaching was discountenanced, and utterly out of use. Some places also are more propitious to learning then others. Athens in Greece, of which see afterwards.Basilea omni∣bus tempori∣bus produxis viro doctrina, sapientia atque eloquentia maximos. Neand. Geograph parte. 12. Prodierunt ex Sicyone quemadmodum Athonis multi tiri praestants i omni artium ac doctrinarum genere. Id. ibid. Corduba in Spain is celebrated also this way. It was the Countrey of Avicenna, and Averroes and Razis, and of Seneca Neros Master, and Lucan the Poet.

AN Art is a Collection of universal precepts prepared to know, act or work in some certain latitude of end.Ars est rei cu∣jusque scien∣tia, usu, vel traditione, vel ratione praece∣pta, tendens ad usum aliquem vitae necessarium Bibliand. de rat. Comm. omnium ling. Ars est collectio universalium praeceptorum parara ad cognoscendum, agendum, vel operandum, in certa aliqua finis latitudine. Ludov. Viv. de tra∣dend. Discip. lib. 1. Nataram aemulatur aers, sed non planè assequitur, saith Bibliander, as we may see in painting and many other works. All Arts are distinguished by the end not the matter. Seneca Consolatio∣ne ad Marci∣am. cap. 18. Gen. 4.21, 22. The knowledge even of mechanical Arts ought to be referred to God the Authour, as the very Gentiles by the light of Nature were forced to confesse, and the Scripture witnesseth in the builders of the Tabernacle of Moses, and of Solomons Temple. distinguisheth Arts into three kindes, some which instruct the life, others which adorn it, others which rule it. The mechanical Arts instruct the life. Liberal Arts are properly those which become free and ingenuous men, which re∣quire understanding, not the operation of the hands.
They are called Liberal Arts, because they are worthy of a Freeman,Artes ingenuae seu liberales idcirco appel∣latoe sunt, quod libero ac in∣genuo sint ho∣mine diguae: sive quòd li∣beros suos se∣ctatores effici∣ant, & in fasti∣gio rerum hu∣manarum qua∣si reges collocent & reponant. Cael. Secund. Cur. Orat. de ingenuis artibus. Latini artes vocant liberales tanquam libero homine dignas. Voss de Philol. cap. 1. Sunt artes universae in duo genera distribuae: in Logicas & Mathe∣maticas. Logicas appellarunt quae in sermonis ratione versantur: Mathematicas, in quantitate. Quantitatis au∣tem duplex genus fecerunt, aliud dejunctum, aliud conjunctum. Dejuncta ad numeros pertinent, ex quibus ea disciplina manavit, quam Arithmaticen dixere. Quemadmodum ex conjunctis Geometria, in qua lineamenta, formae, intervalla, magnitudines versantur. Porro numeri ipsi ad harmoniam translati, Musicem pepererunt, ea enim numeros, voces, & modos continet. Geometriae facultas ad res coelestes accomodata, nobis dedit Astro∣logiam, in qua Coeli conversio, ortus, obitus, motúsque siderum considerantur. Rursum eadem ipsa Geometria ad vim cernendi traducta, Opticen produxit, quae causas affert cur oculi interdum vivendo decipiantur, cùm aut majores, aut minores, quàm sint res, esse videantur. Ex hac vero & ipsa Geometria, pingendi ars orta videtur, quam veteres inter liberales numerabant. Caelii Secun. Cur. Orat. de ingen. art. and inge∣nuous, as if only ingenuous persons should learn and exercise them. It is a received opinion, That there are seven Liberal Arts, three concerning speech, Grammer, Logick, Rhetorick, four concerning Quantity, Geometry, Arithmetick, Musick, Astronomy, which the Grecians call Mathematicks. Gram: loquitur, Dia: vera docet, Rhe: verba colorat Mus: canit, Ar: numerat, Geo: ponderat, Ast: docet astra. , dicitur, quasi , that is, the circle of the Arts, which was wont to be accounted by the number of the seven Liberal Arts. Ric. Vitus Basingstock in his fifth Oration De studiorum finibus, saith, All Arts and Sciences are but ten, the seven Liberal Arts before-mentioned, and three more, Ethicks, Physick, Metaphysicks, into which all Philosophy is di∣vided. Sir Francis Bacon Advancem. of Learning, l. 2. cap. 1.Qui autores in singulis arti∣bus legendi sint.In Gramma∣tica Diomedes, Perottus Valla: in Dialectica Aristoteles: in Rhetorica, Cicro & Fabium praecipul.

Ringelbergius De ratione studii. saith, That is the truest Partition of humane Learning, which hath reference to the three faculties of mans soul, which is the seat of Learning. History is referred to Memory, Poesie to the Imagination, Philosophy to Reason. Theology also or divine Learning (saith he) consists either of sacred History, of Parables, which are a kinde of divine Poesie; or of Precepts and Doctrines, as an eternal Philosophy. There are three Organical Arts, and Arts concerning speech. Grammer,Grammatica à  scribo dicitur Synec. dochicè, quia voce tam scri∣ptâ quam pro∣latâ ad sensa animi proden∣da uti consue∣vimus.

Eras Deratione studii. which shews what should be spoken, and with what Reason; Rhetorick which is for Or∣nament; and Logick which is for Argument and proof. Some call these three general Arts, because they have their use in all things and Arts. I. Grammer. It hath its name from letters. This is as it were an usher to other Sciences, a place not very honourable, yet
necessary, it is an Antidote against that malediction of the confusion of Tongues, Polyd. Verg. It is an Art of speaking well. Others adde, and of writing, but in vain, when writing happens to speaking. Its end is to speak well, the means conducing to this end are the rules of classical writers founded on use. That which is commonly called Orthographia, is better called Orthocepia, because speaking was before writing, which happens to speech. The beginning of this Art and Rhetorick (saith Suetonius l. de grammat.) was thus, by the observation of those things which were either fit or unfit in speaking, men noting those things either to imitate or shun them, made this Art. Austin saith, That there were Grammarians among the people of Israel in the time of Moses. That would be a most excellent kinde of Grammer, if some man skilfull in ma∣ny Languages, as well learned, as mother-tongues, should write a Treatise of the divers Proprieties of Languages; shewing in what points every particular Language doth excell, and in what points it was deficient. Despauterius was a famous Latine Grammarian, Clenard a Greek one, John Isaack an Hebrew one. Our Linacer also was a special Grammarian, and his books de Emendata Structura have much conduced to expell barbarism. Gerardius Vossius hath put out a most learned and elaborate book De Arte Gram∣matica, and another De vitiis Sermonis. Nuncupantur autem triviales scholae quasi vulgares, & in triviis consti∣tutae: quomo∣do nomen id nulli Scholae, ad Latinas, Graecasque literas discen∣das publicitus constitutae conveniat: quae rarò in triviis erectae: quin fere una duntaxat etiam in magnis est urbibus, vel potius inde trivialibus Scholis nomen fecerunt majores, quod in his tres artes, Grammaticen, Rhetoricen, Logicen, do∣cerent. Nam eas trivium dixere: ut quadrivium, quatuor artes Mathematicas; Arithmeticen, Geometriam, Astrologiam, & Muficen: quòd ex Cassiodoro cognoscimus. Voss De vitiis Sermonis l 1. c. 26. Quòd Philoso∣phi, quòd Medici, quòd jure consulti, quòd omni literarum genere plerique exculti sunt, huic uni acceptum refe∣runt omnes: Siquidem per unam Grammaticen, ad omne disciplinarum genus gradum fieri necesse est. Nam ut in aedificiis videmus, nisi solida firmáque constiterint fundamenta, labefactari omnia divuliáque ruinam trahere: sic in disciplinarum profectu, nisi quis puri dilucidique sermonis doctrinam solidè substruxerit, frustra caeteris in sudabit? Cael Sec. Cur. Orat in Nicol. Invitiat. nobil. Grammat.Trivial and Grammer Schools are to be respected and encouraged, because they are the Nurseries of Learning, there the foundation being well laid, young plants thence removed to the publick Universities, well furnished with that kinde of Learn∣ing, may prove eminent instruments in Church or State. Grammer challengeth the first place to it self, and boyes are to learn both the Greek and Latine Grammer. Non modo quod his duabus linguis omnia fermè sunt prodita quae digna cognitu videantur, verùm etiam quod utraque alteri sic affinis est, ut ambae citius percipi queant conjunctim, quam altera sine altera, certè quam Latina sine Graeca. Erasm. De Ratione Studii. For the pure Greek writers, Erasmus commends chiefly Lucian, Demosthenes, Herodotus; and of the Poets, Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides. For the Latine (saith he) Quis utilior loquendi antor quàm Terentius, purus, tersus, & quotidiano ser∣moni proximus, tum ipso quo{que} argumenti genere jucundus adolescentie.

The proper formall object of it is Reason, its adequate end to dispute well. The duties of a Logician, are either general, as that which is comprehended in
the definition of Logick, to reason well; or special, as those which be contained in the distribution of Logick, to invent well, and to judge well. Logice dirigit intellectum in cognitione veri: praecipuaque ejus instrumenta sunt ar∣gumentatio, definitio, divisio, methodus. Gerard. Joan. Vos. De Studiorum ratione parte priore. Zeno the Stoick said, Rhetorick was like the palm, or the hand stretcht out, Logick to the fift, he might have said more fitly (saith Ludovicus Vives De Caus. corrupt. Art. lib. 4.Dialectica est ars benè disse∣rendi, id est, rationes rerum benè discernendi, & inter se componendi. Ames. Demonstrat. Logicae verae. Thess 1. Opus praecipium, Syllogismus, Demonstrativus. Savil. Lect. 12. in Euclyd.) that the Logician collects an Argument for the subtill examination of the learned, but the Rhetorician applies it to the popular sense, for the Oratour often more briefly collects then the Logician.

Nihil aliud est eloquentia, nisi copiosè loquens sapientia. Et benè dicere, non est ornatè tantum, sed scienter & peritè, simul & ornatè dicere. Praeclarè enim, ut omnia, illud dixit Orator: Ex rerum cognitione efflorescat & redundet oporter ora∣tio: quae, nisi subest res ab Oratore percepta & cognita, inanem quandam habet elocutionem, & penè puerilem. Ut enim sine lumine corpora cernere non possumus, ita sine eloquentia nemo sensa & cogitationes suas in lucem aptè proferre potest. Quod sol mundo hoc eloquentia caeteris doctrinis est, sine hac non artes modò aliae, sed res omnes, quae quidem sint dictione explicandae, in altissimo tenebrarum caligine versarentur. Cel. Sec. Cur. Orat. De ingenuis artibus., ut ornata sit. Quintil. Instit. orat. l. 1. c. 5. Nazianzene in one of his Orations saith, He affected Rhetorick so much, be∣cause he had some thing of value to esteem as nothing for Christ. Nemo te, nisi tu, exprimere rectè valet. None is able to set forth eloquence but it self. This hath immortalized Pla∣to, Demosthenes, Cicero, Homer, Virgil, Herodotus, Thucydides, Livie, Salust. Cùm Ciceronem dico, ipsam Romanam eloquentiam intelligere debetis. Cùm verò libros de oratore, opus in ea facultate putatote, quo opere nullum nec Graecia, nec Ita∣lia melius aut perfectius unquam habuit. Cael. Sec. Cur. Orat. de ingenuis artibus. Vide ejus orat. De Rhetoricae usu. Quintilian makes it a chief end and fruit of long pains and exercises in the Art of Rhetorick, to attain to such a faculty,Eloquentia maximè in liberis civita∣tibus flo∣ruit, velut Athenis & Romae, quod is certissimus esset gradus ad maximos honores ac potentiam. Ludov. Viv. de causis corrupt. art. lib 1. Menilius verò incompa∣rabilis tunc eloquentiae vir, & quod summae prudentiae suit, iniquioris caussae nusquam defensor, tanto nativi sermonis candore, tanta sententiarum ubertate Patrum animos demulcebat, ut eos in quam optaret partem ferè flecteret ac impelleret. Seaev. Samarth. Elog. Gallorum doctrina illustrium. l. 2. as to be able also upon any sudden occa∣sion to speak pertinently without any premeditation. What an inchanting force hath Rhetorick? One had need of the force of De∣mosthenes, or rather, that divine eloquence of Tully, to set forth the due praises of eloquence. Pierius Valerianus observes in the 26 Book of his Hieroglyphicks, that sweet eloquence is signified by the Hieroglyphicks of the Bee. Bees setled on Plato's lips when he was a childe sleeping in the Cradle, a presage of his future eloquence. The same is reported of Ambrose and Pindar. The same Pierius in the 41 Chapter of his 20 Book of Hieroglyphicks saith, Wise men did put Syrens for the Hieroglyphick of Eloquence, and the perswading force
of Rhetorick, whence that saying of Cato the Grammarian, Cato Grammaticus, Latina Syren. CHAP. IV. Of the Mathematicks. THe Mathematicks are so named, because they are not learned without a teacher.Mathesis à  di∣co, quod hanc prae reliquis pueri olim di∣scebant. Ex∣plorandae o∣rum indolis & ingenii ergo. Ames. Techno∣met.Mathemata quod sine prae∣ce tore perci∣pi nequeant, dicta sunt. Exinde scientiae Mathematicae dicuntur, quia primitus solae discerentur, antequam animum adpelle∣rent ad Philosophiam naturalem, vel civilem. Vossius de Mathemat. Mathematicas disciplinas omnium accura∣tissimas & utilissimas multis probat Plato in Philaeo. Ideoque primas has artes apud Graecos, tanquam doctrinae quaedam rudimenta discebant, quia scilicet ad reliquas scientias aditum aperiunt; Nam & ingenia acuunt eorum∣que solertiam augent, ad rerum contemplationem excitant, & celeritatem quandam percipiendi conciliant. Et quoniam imitatione percipiuntur, aptae puerilibus animis qui eâ potissimùm ducuntur. Joan. à Wovver. De Po∣lymathia. Tractat. cap. 23. Non solùm in demonstrationum certitudine & scientiae pulchritudine: sed & veritate multiplicique cognitionis copia reliqua artium genera longè antecellunt hae disciplinae, adeò ut non immerito ob id Mathematicae, quasi solae disciplinarum nomine, ob excellentiam, dignae à veteribus appellatae sint. Tych. Brah. Orat. de Discipl. Mathem. Vide Joannis Pellii Orat. inaugural. When Alexander bad his Mathematick master make his lessons easier to him then in his ordinary way to others, he answered him well, The Ma∣thematicks were alike difficult to all. The ancient Philosophers taught their Pupils Mathematicks very soon, as appears by Aristotle and others, they confirming their Propositions by mathematical demon∣strations, the knowledge whereof must be presupposed. See Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mat. The Mathematicks are a most accurate and profitable study for the evidence and certainty of their demonstrations. Abraham was famous for teaching the Mathematicks first among the Chaldeans, and after he taught the same Arts, as Historians write. The old Mathematicians drew their proportions in dust with a Compass, the bet∣ter to shew what they would.De natura Deorum. Pers. at. 1. Tally cals it learned dust. Et secto in pulvere metas. Archimedes was doing this when Siracuse was taken. Viri nobiles, ac principes, qui non su∣crandi, sed Phiosphandi causa literis dant operam, Mathematicis maximè studiis delectantur. Inter quos celeberrimi extiterunt, ex antiquis quidem Archimedes Regum Siciliae consanguineus; Boetius vir consularis; Alphonsus Rex Hispaniarum: nostra vero aetate Marchio Guidobaldus, Princeps Ticho Brahe; Franciscus Candalla, & alii complures, quorum monumenta in omne aevum permansura mundus mirabitur. Blancani Dissertat. De Natura Mathema∣ticarum, cap. 3.Princes and great persons have studied the Mathematicks, and those that study them to purpose, had need to have some Princes or great persons to encourage them therein by their bounty, in respect of the chargeablenesse of their instruments, as Tycho Brahe somewhere saith. Mathematicks are either Pure or Mixt: Qui Mathe∣maticus au∣dire cupit, non Arithme∣ticam modo & Geometriam, quae Mathesin propriè di∣ctam & ab omni materia abstractam constituunt, verum & Astronomiam Geographiam, Opticam, Me∣chanicam, & Staticam, Musicam, Geodaesiam & Architecturam militarem, probè calleat oportet. Hortensii Dissertat. De studio Mathematico recte instituendo.To pure Mathematicks those Sciences are referred, which handle Quantity altogether abstracted from matter; and Physical axioms, they are two, Geome∣try and Arithmetique, the one handling continued Quantity, the other dissevered Quantity, or number. To mixt Mathematicks Astronomy and Musick are usually referred, and the Opticks.
I. Arithmetique is an Art of numbring well.Arithmetica est doctrina bene nume∣randi. Rami. Arithm. l. 1.Arithmetica & Musica separa∣tim magnitu∣dinem, id est, numeros con∣siderat. Geo∣metria magni∣tudinem con∣junctam, sta∣bilem & im∣motam, Astro∣nomia mobilem. Arithmetica merito prima, quae reliquis omnibus usui: ab ea & musica principia sumit. Nam ut Arithmetica proprietates numerorum absolute considerat: ita musica easdem in sonorum differentiis & propor∣tionibus contemplatur. Ratio enim harmoniae quae est musicae, numeris & figuris constat. Harum auxiliis Geometria & Astronomia uruntur. Nam sine Arithmetica, Geometria subsistere non potest. Numerorum enim cognitio prior denotatione linearum. Et ex numeris lineae inventae, ex lineis figurae productae. Astronomia à Geometria lineas & figuras ad coelorum orbes, siderum conversiones considerandas, corporum coelestium intervalla colligenda, eorumque magnitudinem describendam adsumit. Joan. à Wovver. De Polymath. Tractat. c. 23. Arith∣metica subilior est quam Geometria. Quod cunque enim vel accipit vel probat Geometria per numeros dirigi po∣test ab iis enim pendet toa magnitudinum consideratio Mathematicarum. At infinita procedent in numeris, quo∣rum multa non potuerunt in magnitudinum natura comprehendi. Scalig. De Subtil. ad Cardan. Exercit. 321. De∣nique si quid est, in quantitate subtilitatis, id omne ex numerorum ratione haustum est. Pendet igitur Geometriae dispositio ab Arithmetici constitutione. Quae res apud nominem controversa est. Subtilior igitur haec, quae illius statuit principia ac undamenta. Id. ibid. Pythagoras first brought it into an Art, thence the Pythagorans did swear per numerum quaternarium, quo nihil apud eos videtur esse perfectius. For there are four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth; four times of the year, Spring, Au∣tumn, Summer, Winter; four qualities of all things, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drinesse, four Coasts of the Heaven, East, West, North, South. It is the first of the Mathematicks, and usefull to all the rest. One should get some skill in the vulgar Arithmetique before he learn Geome∣try, and that either by a teacher, or by plain books, such as the Arithmetique of Gemma Frisius, or Ramus with Snellius his Notes. The principle of number is unity, as of magnitude punctum. By this the Pythagoreans in times past covered the mysteries of all nature, and even of God himself, as if all things were agreeable to numbers. The Phenicians write as all the Eastern Nations, from the right hand to the left: the reason why the outermost figure to the right hand in Arithmetique stands in the first place, they also being the inventers of that Science. George Sandys upon the 3d Book of Ovids Metam. Some learned men speak much of the Algebra,Quàm mirabi∣le illud veluti scientiarum monstrum, ac portentum, quod Algebram vocant? Nihil fortasse in tota peritiae Encyclopedia subtilius, profundius nihil, non humano ingenio par est, sed quid coelitus revelatum dixeris: numeros illos, quos surdos vocant, & qui nullo modo exprimi postunt addit, subtrahit, multiplicat, dividit, perinde ac si numeri communes essent. Ii qui hanc callent eruditionem nihil in numerorum infinita ditione obscurum nihil arduum timeant. Biancani Dissertatio De natura Mathematicarum, cap. 4. as a famous invention in Arith∣metique. II. Geometry is an Art of measuring well. The measures of things are taken from the parts of man, his finger, palm, foot,Geometria est ars bene me∣tiendi, Rami Geomet. lib. 1. cap. 16. Geometria pars est Ma∣thematicae sci∣entiae, imò basis ac funda∣mentum, atque ut Philo scite loquitur, Metropolis omnium artium Mathematicarum. Nam ex ea, tanquam matrice civitate, derivatae sunt illae nobilissimae Coloniae, Optica, Astronomia, caeterae; ipsaque adeò Arithmetica, cujus subje∣ctum est simplicissimum, & Geometrico simplicium, remotiúsque à materia, utpore carens situ, Geometriae ad∣miniculo stat, eâque nititur, quod admirabile culpiam videatur, ad conclusiones suas demonstrandas. Etsi ex altera parte non negarim Geometriam quoque in irrationalium praesertim doctrina, lucem & praesidium ab Arith∣metica mutuari. Savil. Lect. 2. in Euclyd. Habet magnas utilitates Geometria, sed voluptats etiam partibus infinitis majores habet, quibusque fimile nihil in alia ulla disciplina reperietu: neque enim Grammaticus rhetor logicus, alioqui ettam physicus, & Ethicus invenit in arte sua novi laetitia elatus, immolasse diis memoratur. Thales Milesius cum trianguli in circulo inscriptionem invenisset bovem diis immolavit. Ram. Orat. De sua professione. Vide plura ibid. cubit. A barly corn is the least measure; the finger is the breadth of four barly corns; the palm four fingers; the foot four palms. A cubit from the elbow to the end of the longest finger is a foot and an half. From those measures ariseth the measure of a journey, a pace, a furlong; a mile, a geometrical pace is five foot, a furlong 125 paces, a mile a thousand paces, eight furlongs.
Quatuor ex granis digitus componitur unus, Est quater in palmo digitus, quater in pade palmus, Quinque pedes passum faciunt, passus quoque centum Viginti quinque stadium daut, sed mliare Octo dabunt stadia, duplatum dat tibi Leuca. The Romans used a foot for their measure, as the Jews did a cubit. Plato wrote in the door of his study, , Let no man igno∣rant of Geometry enter in here. Sir Henry Savill in his ninth Lecture upon Euclyde, saith, Ars est omni∣um sine controversia certissima, it is without controversie the most certain Art of all. Tyc. Brahe in his Oration, De Disciplinis Mathematicis, shews, That divers Arts flow from Geometry, Astronomy, Opticks; that of dialing, Geography, Architecture, and the Mechanicks, Geometriae olim in Aegy∣pto & Graecia plurimi certa∣tim incubue∣runt Artifices: quorum singu∣li ad artis con∣stitutionem aliquid con∣tulerunt. Euclides Me∣garensis uno complexus volumine, artis elementa continuo ordine & magna solertia ita tradidit, ut à quovis mediocris ingenii acumine praedito non difficulter percipi possent. Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Math. Quaestio de quadratura circuli multa praeclara exercuit ingenia. Num quaestionis subtilitatem an ingenii humani imbecillitatem, in causa esse dicemus, quod seculis tot fuere desudatum in nodo solvendo, qui adhuc sit involutus. Vossius de Scient. Mathem. lib. 1. cap. 16.All with one consent ascribe the invention of Geometry to the Egyptians. For when the limits of their possessions were confounded by reason of the annual overflowing of Nilus, to restore these, the reason and way of measuring fields was invented, and so Geometry may seem to have drawn its first original from the Husbandmens measuring their grounds. Thales first brought Geometry out of Egypt into Greece; Pythagoras amplified it. To whom many succeeded; Euclide hath brought the Art to that perfection, that he hath cut off hope from all his po∣sterity of enlarging it. The great difficulty among Geometricians is about the quadrature of a circle, which some say, is not faisible. III. Musick. This is either Vocal or Instrumental; Some preferre the Vocall.Therpander Thebanus Mu∣sicus celeberri∣mus primus de musica scripsit. Blancani. Chro∣nol. Clarorum Mathematico∣rum.Musicae prin∣cipis primum Pythagoras ad artem reduxit. Geneb. Chron. l. 2.Hic primus dicitur ex malleorum ictibus vocum diversarum numeros, modes, inflexionesque perpendendo, Musicam artem divina quadam industria confecisse. Cytharam tradunt invenisse Orpheum, Fistulam Pan Arcadius primus infla∣vit. Ringelbergius De Ratione Studii. Quomodo differant , &  (quae tria Hebraeorem instrumenta musica praecipua erant, & junguntur Nehemiae, Cap. xii.) Josephus optimè dicet, lib. 7. Antiq. cap. x. & è nostris Basilius, Chrysostomus, Hieronymus. Vossius. De viti is Sermonis. l. 4 c. 14. Mercer on the 4th of Genesis ver. 21. saith, Jubal was the inventer of Instru∣mental Musick. Pythagoras Musicae theoricam ex Fabri malleis adinvenit. Blancani Chronologia Clarorum Mathemat. Pythagoras invented the Art of Musick from the Smiths hammers. One seeing another playing excellently upon the Lue, said, He thought his soul was in his fingers. Leur esprit s'ensuit au bout des doigts, saith Du Bartas. 1. Sept. Phythagoras, Aristoxenus, Nicomachus, Philolaus, Alypius, Ptolomaus hand∣led Musick professedly, Boetius, Martianus Capella, and venerable Bede, and Mer∣sennus have written also of Musick. Astronomia dicitur , quia do∣cet, qua lege moveantur ac reguntur astra. Vossius de Selent. Math. c. 28. Admiranda prorsus & divina Astronomia, subjecti nobilitate cunctis prior, apta & necessaria omnibus in quibus ulla temporis ratio. Joan. à Wovver. De Polym. Tract. c. 25. In Astronomicis à doctrina Sphaerica initium faciat, legende Institutiones Astronomicas Peuceri, Metii, Maestlini, Crugeri, & Commentaris Clavii in Sphaeram. Job. de Sacroboso. Hrtnsii Differtat. de studio Mathemat. recte instituendo.IV. Astronomy. The word signifies a Doctrine of the Laws or Rules of the measure and motion of the Stars.
The Subject of this Science is the Heavens with the Stars. Diodorus, Pliny and others say, that Atlas was therefore thought to sustain heaven with his shoulders, because he made a Sphere in which the whole heaven was represented. It exceeds not only Arithmetique and Geometry, but all other Arts in this kinde. Nam & antiquitate & nobilitate ac cognitionis sublimitate prae reliquis omnibus ma∣ximam sibi vendicat laudem. Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mathem. Peter Ramus in proaem. Mathem. complained, because we have not now Astrono∣my free from Hypotheses, and therefore easie, as the Egyptians and Babylonians had. But saith Gassendus (Praefat. In Tychonis Brahaei vitam) though some Hy∣potheses be more simple, and so more easie then others, yet Astronomy cannot consist without some. Quod autem celeberrimus ille nostri aevi Philosophus Petrus Ramus existima∣rit, sine Hypothesibus per Logicas rationes Astronomiam constitui posse, caret fun∣damento, &c. Tycho Brahe Epist. Astronom. lib. 1. Christoph. Rothman. Vide plura ibid. Thales Milesius was the first who studied the Stars, Gassendus (in the Preface be∣fore-quoted, and their lives) mentions Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Theon, Pappus,Quantum verò ad nos in a∣strorum scien∣tia pervenit, Hipparchus Rhodius, primus ejus parens cense∣tur. Is enim fixarum loca diligenter observavit. Solisque & Lunae cursus per plurimos subsequentes annos desig∣navit. Ac in caeterorum Planetarum toriusque Coeli observationibus diligentissimus suit. Hujus inventis & considerationibus Ptolomaeus Alexandrinus cum suis collatis, totam artem in certas Hypotheses, unaque in numeros redegit, & immortalem apud omnem posteritatem hinc merito sibi peperit memoriam. Nostra verò aetate Nicolaus Copernicus, quem alterum Ptolomaeum non immeritò dixeris, admiranda ingenii solertia Hypothesibus aliter consti∣tutis coelestium motum, scientiam ita restauravit, ut nemo ante ipsum exactiùs de syderum motibus sit philosophatus. Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mathem. Ex his duobus artificibus Ptolomaeo & Copernico, omnia illa quae nostra aetate, in astrorum revolutionibus, perspecta & cognita habemus, constituta ac tradita sunt. Id. ibid. Alphraganus, Alphonsus King of Castile, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Peurbachius, and Regio-Montanus for famous Astronomers, Blanchinus, and Ptolomy, to which Gassendus himself (the Professour of Astronomy now at Paris) may deservedly be added. V. Opticks. This is a Greek word. It is called Perspectivè in Latine,Optices digni∣tatem cognos∣cimus ex no∣bilitate organi ejus, quod sunt oculi, praecipi∣um cognitionis instrumentum: his enim om∣nem Philoso∣phiam debe∣mus. Etiam Opticae digni∣tatem ostendit objecti prae∣stantia; Cùm luce & colori∣bus nihil sit melius vel jucandius. Vossius de sci∣entiis Mat. c. 24 Unam Opti∣cen video so∣lam esse artem, quae caeterarum communis splendor dici possit, quae solis instar, reliquis lucem impertiat, rerum in naturae majestate abditarum nubem dispellat. Pena de usu optices. Vide Volat. Comment-Urban. l. 35. a bar∣barous but significant word, Optica est ars bene videndi. The Opticks is an Art of seeing well. Light and colour are visible by themselves, so it is said; Light indeed is, but co∣lours will not be visible in the dark. We should examine and weigh the writings of the chief Astronomers by this Lesbian Rule. Luceus was the first Inventer of the metal-Mines, and hence arose the common fable, that he also saw those things which were under the earth. Pisanus was the Author of the common Perspective. Alhazeus and Vitellio, and Pena on Euclide, and Peckam Archbishop of Can∣terbury have done best on the Opticks. Galen skilfull in the Opticks as well as Physicks, gives this demonstration, why one and the same appears one to two eyes, Eadem est basis pyramidum sub radiis ab oculo missis comprehensarum. There are perfect demonstrations in the Opticks; as why a hollow glasse burns, because the Sun-beams reflected are there gathered together; why a staff appears broken in the water, because it is seen by lines refracted, through a double medium of air and water.
CHAP. V. Of the Civil and Canon-Law. THere are three main things in the Civil-Law, The Pandects, the Code, and the Novellae Constitutiones.Jurisconsulto∣rum Com∣mentarios non passim sed parce admo∣dum, & cum delectu admit∣tebat, veluti Alciarum, Budaeum, Cui∣acium, Dua∣renum, Govea∣num, Augusti∣num, & caee∣ros qui jus civile in pri∣stinam digni∣tatem restitue∣runt: alios ab his longum.

The Pandects or Digests, containing Responsa prudentum, or the sayings of Lawyers, to which the Decree of Gratian in the Canon-Law composed out of the sentences of the Councels and Fathers answers. 2. Codex, the Code, consisting only of the Decrees of the Emperours, to which the five Books of the Decretals answer in the Canon-Law, consisting of the Constitutions onely of the Pope of Rome. Malè actum est cum rebus humanis, cum ad Decreta accesserunt alae. 3. Novellae Constitutiones, viz. Imperatoriae, put out after the Code, to which in the Canon-Law the sixth of the Decretals, the Clementines and Extravagants answer. See D. Duck of the Authority of the Civil-Law, l. 1. c. 4. First, One should diligently reade the elements of the Civil-Law, comprehend∣ed in the four Books of Justinians Institutions, Calvins Lexicon of the Law should be perused. Then we may go on to the Pandects and Code, on which there are many Commentaries. Cuiacius is an excellent Author. It is called the Canon-Law by reason of the matter, because it contains Eccle∣siastical Constitutions which they call Rules or Canons; and by reason of the end, because it was collected and confirmed to that end, that it may prescribe a Rule of Ecclesiastical Government. The Canon-Law contains The Decree of Gratian for the most part collected out of the sentences of Fathers, and Decrees of Councels. The Decretals of Gregory the ninth. The sixth of the Decretals of Boniface the eighth. The Clementines and Extravagants collected out of the Epistles and replies of the Popes. Corpus Canonum à Gratiano Monacho consarcinatum ab Eugenio 111. Pontifice Rom. comprobatum & authoritate firmatum fuisse constat: qui ut in Academiis doce∣retur propéque Tribunali in Judiciis reciperetur (ut & postea factitatum est) praece∣pit. Gentil. Apol. c. 1. Lancelots Institutions are commended for the Canon-Law, as Minsinger on Ju∣stinians Institutions for the Civil-Law. In the Body of the Canon-Law the Canons are sometimes diametrially opposite one to the other. Archidaconus, Panormitan, Innocentius, Rebuffus, were famous Canonists. Of Philosophy. It is either Natural or Moral, called Ethicks. Natural Philosophy De mundo, aut de iis quae sunt in mundo, quaerit. Pier Valer. Hierog. l. 38. c. 10. Tully cals Philosophy in his Offices, Studium sapientiae; in his Tusculanes, vir∣tutis indagatricem, expultricemque vitiorum. Socrates, Plato. Aristoteles tres viri constitu∣endae Philosophiae sine dubio divinitùs excitati. Casaub. Praefat. ad Theophrast. Charact.How many several sorts of Philosophers are mentioned? who were severed by
their distinct Schools, of Academicks, Peripatetiques, Stoicks, Epicures, Pytha∣goreans, too numerous to be rehearsed. Of all which, see Desiderii Jacotii De Phi∣losophorum doctrina libellum ex Cicerone.Philosophiae probè locatis fundamentis, sine quibus de Galeni senten∣tia, nemo medicus bonus dici potest, sedulam medi∣cis operam dedit. Melch. Adam. in vita Opsopaei. Aristotle was the Prince of the Peripateticks, Zeno the chief of the Stoicks, Epi∣curus of the Epicureans, and Pythagoras of the Pythagoreans. Philosophiam opti∣mè docebit Plato & Aristoteles, atque hujus Discipulus Theophrastus, tum utrinque mixtus Plotinus. Erasm. De Ratione Studii. As the Grecians for the title of wise men, called themselves lovers of wisdome, that is, Philosophos, so also the Doctors of the Jews often were not called wise men, but Scholars of wise men, that is, studious of wisdome. Vbi desinit Philosophus ibi incipit Medicus, ubi desinit Medicus ibi incipit Theologus. Ethicks or Moral Philosophy. It is so called because it is conversant about the manners of men.Nominatur Ethica à Grae∣ca voce , id est, mos seu cōsuetudo, quia versatur circa hominum mo∣res, quapropter & latine scientia moralis appellatur. Definiri potest, Scientia practica humanarum actionum quatenus in illis honestas locum habere potest. Walaei compendium Ethicae Aristotel. The adequate object of it are humane actions, not considered any way, but as honesty hath place in them, and as they are capable of vertue. Dr Ames hath a Theological Disputation against it, and shews, that all Aristotles practical vertues are to be found in the Scripture. Physick. The subject of it is mans body, the end health. It is lawfull, it was before the promulgation of the Law, Gen. 50.2. The Poets brought in Apollo, as the chief god of Medicine, to whom they have assigned Aesculapius for his sonne. Christ was a Physician both of soul and body. Omnibus est aliis Medicus praestantior unus. Is Homers verse. Physical Institutions are a mellificium compounded out of the choisest flowers. A long series of times hath brought forth many famous Grecians, Physicians, some Latines, and some Arabians. Among the Grecians, Hippocrates and Galen excelled. Dioscordes also was a good Physician. Amongst the Latine Physicians Cornelius Celsus was the first. Of late Fernelius and Sennertus. Amongst the Arabians, Avicenna Qui dele∣ctantur fusa & polydaedala varietate reme∣diorum, Avi∣cennam amplectantur: Cuncta enim hujus aevi remedia ex eo manant. Heurnii De studio medicinae bene Instituendo medit. Vide plura ibid. In plantis Hebraeis multùm debemus LXX interpretibus. Nam absque illis foret, & paucis Aquilae, Theodotionis, aliorumque fragmentis; non video, quid certi statuere possimus de multis plantarum vocabulis, quae in veteri instrumento se offerunt. Vossius De vitiis Sermonis, lib. 1. cap. 28., Rhazes, Averrhoes, Avenzoar, Mesue, Serapio, and Alsaharavius were chief. In Plants there is much difficulty. Vide Voss. De vitiis Sermonis l. 1. c. 28. Rondeletius, Matthiolus, Bellonius, Camerarius, Bau∣hinus, Spigelius, have done well about Herbs. Alexandria of old, and Padua of late,Amianus l. 22. pro omni experimento dictitat sufficere medico, fi Alexandria se dixerit eruditum. Alexandrinam autem Academiam excepit nostras Patavina in hoc genere laudis, cum abundè conster, medicum apud nos docturam consecutum majoris fieri, quam alterum qui asibi. Pignor. Symb. Epist. Epist. 9. is famous for the Profession of Physick. Metaphysicks.This is called by some Theolo. gia naturalis. Si quid tamen laudis Meta∣physicae sit tribuendum, illud erit, quod inanes quosdam portentosarum distinctionum fumos invexerit, ad obscurandam simplicem veritatem. Ames. Disputat. Theol. adversus Ethicam. It is the highest part of all Philosophy from the subject of it, because it treats De causa altissima. Dr Ames hath a Theological Disputation against Metaphysicks, and saith, it is but an imaginary science.
Mr Baxter in his Reply to Mr Kendall, saith he hath above thirty Tracts of Me∣taphysicks by him, and seems to value Suarez, Schibler and Burgersdicius before all the rest. History. Historia est testis temporum, nuncia vetustatis, lux veritatis, vita memoriae, Ma∣gistra vitae, Cic. 2do de Oratore.See of the Ety∣mology of History and the difference be∣tween History and Annals in Vossius his Ars Hi∣storica, cap. 1.

Evangel. parte 2da Dub. 2. p. 63. Historia est rerum, publicè gestarum, diffusa & continuata narratio. Muretus. The end of it is double, profit and pleasure. Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. Ferdinand King of Sicily, and Alphonsus King of Spain, recovered their health by reading of History, the first by reading Livy, the second by reading Q. Curtius. Some have observed, that the being versed in Books of History makes men wiser then in those of Policy, for that those furnish us with instances as well as rules, and as it were personate the rule, and draw it out more into the full lineaments. Mr Herles Morall prudence ch. 19. History is either 1. Ecclesiasticall, which handleth Church matters, and is for its Antiquity and Dignity to have the precedence. Vide Sixt. Senens. in Praefat. ad Lectorem in Bibliotheca Sancta. Or 2. Politicall, which handleth civil matters, in Kingdoms, States or Com∣monweals. Just or perfect History is of three kindes, according to the nature of the object which it propounds to represent; for it either represents a portion of time, or some memorable Person, or some famous Act. The first we call Chronicles or Annals; the second Lives; the third Relations. Of these Chronicles seem to ex∣cell, for celebrity and name: Lives for profit and examples: Relations for sin∣cerity and verity. Sr Francis Bac. Advancem. of Learn. l. 2. c. 7. The History of Times is either universall or particular: This comprehends the affairs of some Kingdom,Semper lauda∣ta fuit histo∣ria: quae singularia facta aque res gestas no∣bis ostendens, cujuscunque temporis ac secui exempla suppeditat: Nec unius regionis can∣cellis con∣stringitur; sed quam latè terrarum termìni extenduntur, expatiatur. Verum enimverò cum varia sint historiarum genera nullum huic praeferendum videtur, quo quis ea pretexit, quae multis, longeque ac late dissitis regionibus perlustra∣tis, maximè notatu digna scripto consignans, lectores ne latum quidem unguem progressos per longinquas regiones deducit. Hujusmodi historiae itineraria audiunt: quae bona fide contexta hac prae reliquis praerogativa gaudent, quod majorem fidem mereantur, adeoque lectorem certiorem reddant, utpote quae ex  res gestas, casus ac eventa enarrent. Constantini L' Empereur Epist. Dedicat. Ad Itinnerarium D. Benjaminis. or State, or Nation: That the affairs of the world. Amongst Histories Itineraries have the preheminence, when one shall faith∣fully relate the most memorable things he hath observed by travelling into many and strange Countries: And amongst Itineraries, that of R. Benjamin a Jew hath been very much esteemed by many, (saith Constantine L' Empereur) because he did not only travell over Europe and Africa, but professeth that he entred into the most inward and extream regions of Asia, where he witnesseth that he saw rare things and yet unknown to our world: and therefore his little book abundantly affords examples of very many things, so that it cannot but be read with delight. The first Law given to an Historian (saith Tully de Oratore) is Nequid falsi dicere audeat: deinde nequid veri non audeat; ne qua suspicio gratiae sit in scribendo, ne qua simultatis. The composing of a History consists in things and words: for things he must have respect to the order of time and the description of places, the manners, lives, counsels, sayings, deeds and events of men; for words, the kinde of speech must not be large, yet adorned with a pure and famous brevity.
T. Livius in the opinion of all Learned men is the Prince of Latine History, there are only two books of Salusts.A Catalogue of some of the chiefest Histo∣rians.In Historia apud Graeco floruit Thucy∣dides. Herodo∣tus, Theopompus. Apud nos T. Livius, rispus Salustius, & plerique alii, Polyd Verg. De Invent. Rerum, lib. 1. cap. 12.Vossius hath written an excellent book, De Historicio Graecis & Latinis.

Theodorus Zuingerus & Joan. Sambutus de Historia. Joannis Thoma Freigii Historiae Synopsis. Caesars Commentaries contain famous things but done in a few years. Trogus Pompeius who composed the Greek Histo∣ries and those of the whole world in Latine, and in fourty four Volumes hath written the affairs of all ages, Kings, Nations and people, is wholly lost, but that we have in Justin a short little body as it were of the flowers of it. Suetonius, Ta∣citus, Q. Curtius, are good Historians, and many later then them, Orosius, Paulus Diaconus, Eutropius, and others of later time, yet Blondus, Antoninus, Sabellicus, Collenutius, Machiavell, Aretinus, Platina, Carius, Simoneta, Ca∣preolus, Merula, and those yet later, Paulus Jovius, Sleiden, Guicchardine, the last being the best Historian. The best Greek Historians (although some of them be imperfect) are Herodo∣tus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Dion, Eusebius, and others. Chronology and Topography are the two eyes of History. In Chronology.Epocha est certum atque illustre prin∣cipium tempo∣ris, à quo re∣liqui anni nu∣merantur. Epocha autem dicitur à Grae∣co verbo , i. e. re∣tinere, & inhi∣bere: quia est temporis quaedam re∣tentio & inhi∣bitio, quâ tanquam certo sixoque signo Historiae continentur. Apellantur etiam Aera quae vox ab Hispania primum inventa & usurpata est, qui temporum computationes ab anno 16 Augusti Caesaris ordiri solebant. Incerti Auctoris epitome Praecognitorum Historicorum. The Epochae are to be observed. The Epochae are two fold. 1. Ecclesiasticall, which are noted in the Scriptures and Ecclesiasticall Hi∣stories; of which eleven as more famous are mentioned, from the beginning of the world, the Flood, the building of the Tower of Babel, Abrahams peregrinati∣on, the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, the year of Sabbath, the year of Jubilee, Solomons Temple, the Babylonish Captivity, Daniels Seventies, the birth of Christ. The Christian Aera, that is, the way of numbering times from Christ being born, although it be most laudable, yet began lately, and hath not been long used in designing publick or private affairs. Helvic. in System. Chron. 2. Politicall, which are observed in prophane Histories, and are used in civil affairs. Of these some most famous are, 1. Of the Olympiads: which is of the Grecians. Olympias est spacium quinque annorum à Latinis Lustrum dictum, in the beginning of the fifth year the Olym∣pian games were wont to be celebrated, with great concourse of all Greece, so called from Olympia a City in Thessaly, in which those sports were exercised. This is the noblest computation of time among the Heathens. 2. Epocha urbis conditae, id est, Romae. 3. Est C. Julii Caesaris, from whence the Roman Emperours are numbred. Aera, pro quo & Era, dicitur pro Epocha, sive supputationis initio. In Gothicarum, ac Hispanicarum rerum scriptoribus, plurimisque conciliis, est crebrum, atque ab eo tempore inchoat, quo Hispani, jussu Augusti recepore formam anni Iuliani; quod factum XXXVIII. annis ante natum Iesum Christum ex vulgari ara Christi.Cosmogra∣phiam brevis∣simè cradit Pomponius mela, do∣ctissime Ptolimaeus, diligentissime, Plinius Eras. de Ratione Studii.

Of Poetry. Vide Fulleri Miscel. Sac. l. 1. c. 20. & Spec. Arab. Johan. Fabric. p. 170. ad 178. Eras. Epist. l. 9. Epist. 120.It is referred to the imagination, and is a kinde of Learning in words restrained; in matter loose. It is an art of deceit, which measureth expressions, not by the truth of the sub∣ject, but by the strength of imagination working upon it. It principally serves for venting extraordinary affections. Poetry is the quintessence or rather the luxury of Learning. The Originall of this Art is very ancient, and (as Euseb. l. 2. de praeparat. Evang.) first flourished with the most ancient Hebrews, who were long before the Poets of the Grecians. Moses made an exhameter Verse, wherein he gave thanks to God for their deliverance at the red Sea. David composed many Hymns. Quid Deutoronomii & Esaiae cantico palchrius? Quid Solomone gravius? Quid perfectius Job? quae omnia hexametris & pentametris versibus apud suos composita decurrunt, Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 8. Orpheus (saith Porphyrius) first illustra∣ted this Art, then Homer and Hesiod. It is taken in a double sense, as it respects words, and so it is a kinde of chara∣cter of speech; for verse is a kinde of style and form of elocution, and pertains not to matter; for a true narration may be composed in verse; and a faigned in Prose. Or as it respects matter, so it is imitation of History at pleasure. Sir Frau. Bac. Advanc. of Learn. l. 2. c. 13. Poetica ars multis me∣hercle de causis, reliquas antecellit seiplinas, vel quia homines nullam penè artem assequi possunt, nisi in illam diu incubuerint, ut quod scientias fere, ut trabo in primo Geographiae adversus Eratosthenem pulchrè demonstrat, in se continet omnes: vel demum quod ex omni∣bus artibus, quae ab humani excellentia proficiscuntur, sola poetica divino furore peroipitur. Ná poetae furore afflari res omni admiratione & stupore dignas canunt, tuncque veri vates sunt, cum insaniunt. Polyd. Verg. de Rer. Inv. l. 1. c. 8.It is either Narrative, or Representative, or Allusive. Narrative is a meer imitation of History, but that often it extols matters above belief. Dramaticall or Representative, is, as it were, a visible History, it sets out the Image of things, as if they were present: History, as if they were past. Parabolicall or Allusive is History with the Type, which brings down the Ima∣ges of the understanding to the objects of sense. Poets were the first Priests, Prophets, Le∣gislators and Polititians, the first Philoso∣phers, Astrono∣mers, Historio¦graphers, Ora¦tors and Musici¦ans in the world.Because neither our senses are moved with extraordinary effects of Gods power, nor our mindes bent to observe the waies of his wisdom, so as we might be stricken with true admiration of them, we have fewer good sacred Poems, then of any other kinde. But as the Ancients chief learning did consist of Poetry, so the ex∣cellency of their Poetry was chiefly seen in the proper and native subject of this faculty, that is, in matters of sacred use or observation. Whence the title of Vates did descend to secular or prophane Poets, which retained the number and manner of speech used by the former. The Book of Psalms, Job, and the Songs of Moses, are the only pattern of true Poesie. Dr Jacksons Comment upon the Apost. Creed, Vol. 1. c. 14. Metri origo à Deo optimo maximo est; qui hunc ter∣rarm orbem, & omnia ab eo contenta, certa ratione quasi metro dispo∣suit: harmo∣niam enim, ut Pythagoras docuit, in Caelestibus terrenisque rebus nemo hercle esse dubitat. Nam quo pacto mundus consisterer, nisi certa ratione & numeris praesinitis ageretur? Omnia quoque instrument quibus utimur, mensura quadam, id est, metro siunt. Quòd si hoc in caeteris rebus accidit, quanto magis in oratione, quae cunctas complectitur? Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 1. c. 9. Mirus gentium consensus in poëscos rhythmicae, itan vocant, amore. Nam omnes ferè populi Europae, Asiae, Africae, ab aliquot retro seculis non alios praeter ittos versus norunt. Casaub. ad Pers. Sat. 1.The Greek and Latine Poesie was by verse numerous and metricall, running upon pleasant feet, sometimes swift, sometime slow, (their words very aptly ser∣ving for that purpose) but without any time or tunable concord in the end of their verses, as we and all other Nations now use. But the Hebrews and Chaldees, who were more ancient then the Greeks, did not only use a metricall Poesie, but also with the same a manner of time, as hath been of late observed by Learned men. Our manner of vulgar Poesie is more ancient then the artificiall of the Greeks and Latines, ours coming by instinct of nature, which was before Art and observati∣on, and used by the wilde and savage people, who were before all Science or Civility.
In the time of Charlemaine and many years after him the Latine Poets wrote in time. The School of Salerne dedicated their book of Medicinall rules unto our King of England, beginning thus, Anglorum Regi scribit schola tota Salerni Si vis incolumem, si vis te reddere sanum Curas tolle graves, irasci crede prophanum Nec retine ventrem, nec stringas fortiter anum. All the rest go on in the same way, well to the purpose of their Art. One wrote these verses against the whole rable of Monks, O Monachi vestri stomachi sunt amphora Bacchi, Vos estis Deus est testis turpissima pestis. Hugobald the Monk made a large Poem to the honour of Carolus Calvus, every word beginning with C, which was the first letter of the Kings name thus, Carmina Clarisonae Caluis Cantate Camenae. There were 1. Heroick Poets, such as wrote long Histories of the noble acts of Kings and great Princes, and the great matters of peace and warre,Metrorum plura sunt ge∣nera, quae auctore Servio, vel à rebus quae descri∣buntur, nomi∣na accepere, ut heroicum, quod hexame∣trum: licet Moses pri∣mus usurpa∣verit, tamen quia Homerus, & caeteri qui deinceps secuti sunt, heroum res gestas hoc carmine scriptitarunt, heroi∣cum nominatum est. Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 1. c 9. Vide plura ibid. whereof Homer was chief and most ancient among the Greeks, Virgil among the Latines 2. Lyrique Poets; quôd eorum ferè carmina ad sonum Cithara recitarentur. They delighted to write songs of pleasure, of which sort was Pindar, Anacreon and Callimachus, with others among the Greeks: Horace and Catullus among the Latines. 3. Elegiack, who wrote in a certain pitious verse called Elegy; such among the Latines were Ovid, Tibullus, and Propertius. 4. There were Comicall Poets who wrote Enterludes to recreate the people with matters of disport, of whom among the Greeks, Menander and Aristopha∣nes were most excellent; with the Latines, Terence and Plautus, and also Tragicall,Vide Polyd. Vergil. De Invent. Rerum l. 1. c. 10, & 11. In Tragaedia praecipue spectandi affectus, & quidem ferè acriores illi. In Comaedia cum primis observandum est decorum, & vitae communis imitatio, assectus sint mitiores, & jucundi magis quam acres. Eras. de Ratione Studii. In Epigrammatis arguta brevitas laudatur. Id. ibid. who set forth the dolefull fals of unfortunate and afflicted Princes, such were Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles with the Greeks; Seneca among the Latines. Satyricall, who taxed the vices of the people in bitter speeches, such were Lucilius, Juvenall and Persius among the Latines. Others were given wholly to scoffing at undecent things, and in short Poems uttered pretty merry conceits, and these were called Epigrammatists, as Martiall. Poets are drawn with a desire of glory, and are greedy of praise. Nec petitur sacris nisi tantum fama Poetis. There are Deliciae Poetarum, where the famous Italian, French, German and Scotch Poets are mentioned.There are also Flores Poeta∣rum, at the end of which is a defence of the Poets. Horace hath written de Arte Poetica, and Vossius de Poetis Graecis & Latinis, and Sir Philip Sidnie in English of Poetry. Chytraeus hath this Epigram, In tres Petros Poetas. Carmine quid possint Itali, & cum Teutone Galli, Scire cupis ternos aspice quaeso Petros Italia Angelium, Ronsardum Gallia, suave Lorichii ingenium Teutonis ora tulit.
Of Painting. Painting is silent Poetry, and Poetry a speaking Picture. Pictura muta poesis, poesis loquens pictu∣t Aristot. Rhet. l. 3. Scripturam picturam esse arguunt verba Graeca & Latina, quia  tam picturam significat quàm scripturam, & literae à lino, unde lineae. Bibliander de Ratione communi omnium Linguarum, c. 6. Pictura adeo magno in honore apud veteres homines suit, ut cum caeteros fermè omnes artifaces fabros nuncupatent, solum pictorem huic nuncupationi eximerent, ut innuit Leo Baptista Albertus l. 11. de Pictura. Qui etiam addit om∣nium atrium florem illam esse, nec sanè immerito mea sententia, quippè quae venustatem colorum, & lucis ignem una exprimat, affectus omnes representet, defunctorum memoriae consular, caeli conversiones, teriae vices, diel & noctis partes, Artes acumina apicesque, Divinitatem ipsam (quantum licet assequi cogitatione) subjiciat pe∣nicillo. Et hinc factum est, ut Graeci politissimi hominum caverent edicto ne servi pingerent, quod nobilissi∣mam artem servili manu & ingenio pollui pertimescerent. Neque defuerunt viri accurati & eloquences, qui Hi∣storiam pictorum pertexerent, veluti Aristodemus Car, testè Philostrato in Iconibus, & Polemon apud Athenae∣um lib. 11. Pignor. Symb. Epist. Ep. 42. Vide plura ibid.Of the first Inventer of it, See Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 2. c. 24. Zeuxis, Appelles, Lysippus, Parrhasius, Praxiteles, Phidias, were famous Painters. Two Artificers contended for the mastery in their Art and faculty, the Zeuxis. first drawing Grapes so lively that he couzened the birds, the Parrhasius. other a Vail so exqui∣sitely that he couzened the Artificer himself.

Keckermanni Problemata Nautica.Of Navigation. This Art is much perfected since Salomons time. Prima dedit nautis usum magnetis Amalphis. John Tapp hath written of the Art of Navigation: and Sr Thomas Rives hath written Historiam Navalem in two parts. The vertue of the Loadstone is certainly wonderfull, unknown to Aristotle and Pliny,Usus magnetis & nauticae acus eo tactae, atque pixidis Magneti vim inesse ut acum ipso ractam, ad polum Articum dirigat, ignorum omninò priscis omnibus. Crak. log. l. 4. c. 9. Tanta est illius vis, ut non immerito â magnis viribus nomen habeat magnetis, quare etiam Herculeus à multis appellatur, etsi à Magnete quodam illius inventore sic appeliatum putet Plinim, à verò regione nomen ejus deducat Lucretius. A ferro autem quod domat, & sibi obsequens facit, sideritis meritò vocatur. Id. ib. and all the Ancients, which vertue thus now being known and understood, Navigation through and about the whole world was made easie and happy. Sir Francis Bacon in his first book of the Advancement of Learning, lib. 1. cap. 4. saith, The Sciences which hold more of the Fancy and of Belief, then of Reason and Demonstration, are chiefly three, Astrology, naturall Magick and Alchimy. I. For Astrology. Nam veceres omnes, ut hoc obitr mone∣am tyrones, Astronomia & Astrologia uruntur ut Synonimis. Plato ferè Astronomiae vocabolo utitur, Aristoteles Astrolo∣giae, per archaismum prisco & obsoleto more, ut vult Simplicius ad libros de caelo. Savil. lect. 2d• in Euclid.Though the Ancients generally confounded Astronomy and Astrology, yet they are to be distinguished, as the very Greek words shew. Mr Burgesse his Treatise of Sin. Serm. 14.The Scripture, Psal. 19. commending the Sunne and the Starry Heavens for all its proper uses and ends that we should make of them, saith not the least word of Judiciall Astrology, or foretelling future events in the world by them: where∣as if that were true which is said, that God by the Heavens as by a Book, hath revealed what he would do, it would have commended the study of the Heavens for this end to all;Insectatur hoc loco Propheta Iesaias ex ore Dei, omnes Divinos, Ari∣olos, Arupi∣ces, Astrolo∣gos, angures, Genethlicos, Mathematicos, Planetarios, Pythones, denique omnes qui artem futura & abdita divinandi profitentur, sicut Orientales solebant. Omnibus enim iis atque aliis multis nominibus fuerunt hujusce divinatores, variis temporibus appellati: olim Chaldaei & Orientales, & Genetbliaci: Augustini temporibus, Mathematici & Planeturii: nunc passim Astrologi vocantur & Necromantici.

Bez Epist. 29. for if God have manifested his will by it, then certainly he would have commanded us to search for it there, as he doth command us to finde out his will in the Scripture. But the Scripture is so farre from commending such a study, that it expresly forbids it as a grievous sinne, Deut. 18.10, 14. Isa. 2.6. & 41.23. & 44.25. & 47.12. Jer. 10.2. Eccles. 10.14. And that Ju∣diciall Astrology is a vanity, appeareth by this reason; They undertake to fore∣tell contingencies for the most part, from the position of the seven Planets:
Now there being so vast a number of fixed Stars, which have influence in earthly things in some proportion as well as the Planets, how is it possible that they should foretell any certain truth? One in Basill by his calculation noted a certain day which he mistrusted should be fatall unto him, by some thing which should at that time befall him, Where∣upon he determined with himself all that day to keep him sure and safe within his chamber, where he reaching up his hand to take down a Book,Foxes Act. and Monum. the Book falling down upon his head gave him his deaths wound, and shortly after he died upon the same. Tycho Brahe in his Oration de Disciplinis Mathematics,Praedictiones Astrologicae non solum à vulgo, quod omnes Artes aequali odio prosequitur: sed à quibus∣dam etiam eruditis homi∣nibus in du∣bium vocan∣tur: quamvis sola Artis ignorantia eos excusare possit. Pergunt enim Arti contradicere, cujus principia summis labris non degustarunt, & cum in aliqua cognitione excellunt, de omnibus aliis rebut quamvis ab ea cognitione longè dissitis, sibi judicium arrogant. Solus Picus Mirandula Astrologiae gnarus eam ex propriis Apotelesmatis convellere aggressus est. Sed hujus objectionibus Lucius Bellonius erudito scripto jamdudum respondit. Et ipse Picas mortuus anno aetatis 33, quem tres Astrologi illi fatalem ex directione ascendentia ad corpus martis praedixe∣rant, Astrorum efficaciam, quam infringere voluit, nimis cerro eventu, proprio interitu comprobarit. Tych. Brah. Orat. de Discipl. Mathem doth plead somewhat for Astrology. But Gassendus de Doctrina Epicuri, hath a Diatribe against Judiciall Astrology, and cals it ridiculous. Sixtus ab Hemminga wrote a Book against those which profess Astrology, which he entitled, Astrologiae ratione & experientia refutatae liber. He shews there, that all the promises which Astronomers make of future events are vain, and that evi∣dently in the genitures of thirty famous persons, which Suffridus Petrus de Scri∣ptoribus Frisiae reckons up. Another kinde of Divination is Physiognomy. If I say a sanguineous man is prone to lust, that is a true judgement,Ipsa nominis notatio signi∣ficat Philoso∣phis scientiam illam, quâ vel ex totius cor∣poris, vel alterius partis corporis aspectu, de hominis natura & ingenio judicamus. Zanch. de Divinat. per sortes. this is pro∣perly Physiognomy, but if thou saiest, he is actually lustfull, that is a rash judge∣ment, for by reason or the grace of God he may restrain that, as the story of So∣crates is known. A certain kind of Physiognomy is called Chiromancy or Palmestry, which is a divination by inspection of the lines in the hand,Chiromantia quid sit, ipsius nominis nota∣tio indicat: Divinatio est, quae fit ex ma∣nuum inspecti∣one. In S. lite∣ris, he verbum quidem ullum de Chiromantia habemus. Dico ex manuum inspectione verè & certè cognosci posse cùm corporis constitutionem, tut multorum affectuum propensionem. Quoniam signa quae sunt in manu, ut illa lineamenta, inter quae numeratur & linea vicalis ab Aristotele & medicis, connexionem quandam certam & necessariam habent cum corporis constitutione, & affectum propensione. Actuales verò mores, aut futuras contingentes actiones as dignitates, verè ac cerrò praesentir c praedici posse ex manuum inspectione, inficior. Quoniam lineaments manus seu vitae, nullam certam aut necessariam cum actualibus moribus, aut futuris actionibus connexionem habent. Zanch. de Divinat. —Frontemque manémque praebebit vati. Juv. Sat. 1. Aristotle in his singular book of Physiognomy hath made no mention of Chi∣romancy, yet I beleeve the Egyptians, who were addicted to those abstruse and mysticall sciences had a knowledge therein, to which those vagabond and coun∣terfeit Egyptians did after pretend, and perhaps retained a few corrupted prin∣ciples,
which sometimes might verifie their prognosticks. Dr Brown. Religio Medici. See of them Camerar. Histor. Meditat. l. 1. c. 17. II. Of Natural Magick. Magicarum artium usum inde coepisse inter homines existimo, quod Diabolus se∣cutus exem∣plum consue∣tudinis & colloquiorum Dei, cum san∣ctis Patribus, eodem modo alias alia specie sese exhibuit hominibus, ut hujus imitationis & colloquiorum occasione se facilius insinuaret, & à verbo Dei aversos animos, ad petendas à se, & expectandas declarationes, admonitiones, patefactiones, & alia hujus generis assuefaceret. Gasp. Peuc. De Divinat-generibus, p. 309. Magi, vox, ut multis videtur Persica, quae licet jam infamis, primo tamen honori fuit, & vel Philosophum, vel ut vult Appuleius sacerdotem significabat. Ouzel. animadvers. ad Minut. Felic octav. Vide Dilher. Disp. Acad. Tom. 2. p. 184.Some distinguish between Natural, Artificial and Diabolical, though others dislike them all. Zoroaster is said first to invent this Art of Magick. Vide Aug. De Civ. Dei. l. 21. c. 14. & Polyd. Verg. De Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 22. Magick flourished especially among the Persians. One saith, Magia est ars impetrandi à Diabolo quicquid ipsi praescripseris. Magick is an Art of obtaining of the Devil whatsoever thou shalt command him. As Christianity is an Art of obtaining from God what is profitable, so Magick is an Art of obtaining from the Devil what thou shalt command him. For the Devil is the Author and worker of those things which the Magicians work; though one saith, The Art is but Naturalis Philosophiae absoluta consummatio, the absolute per∣fection of natural Philosophy. Plinie speaketh of Moses his Myracles, though he do ill in calling him a Magi∣cian, for, 1. what likenesse is there between the illusions of a Magician, which vanish away in the twinkling of an eye, and the leading of a mighty great Nation through the Sea,Jannes and Jambres Ma∣gicians resisted Moses, 2 Tim. 3.8. and which is more, the maintaining of them from hunger and thirst so long a time. There is no Law in the world doth so expresly forbid Magick as doth the Law of Moses, as if the Law would thereby purposely prevent this slander. Benno the Cardinal in the life of Hildebrand relates, that five Popes Sylvester the 3d,Diabolicis artibus Sylve∣ster tertius Pontifex eva∣sit. De quo Stellu devitis Pont. in Sylv. III. Platina aliique. Romanus Pontifex, Diabolo adjuvante, constitutus, bac tamen lege; ut post obitum, totus illius, & in anima, & in corpore, esset. Gomarus Disp. 21. De Antichrist. Benedictus the 9th, John the 20. and 21, Gregory the 7th, did wholly give themselves to the Devil that they might be Popes. He hath a notable story there of Hildebrand, about his carring a book of Necro∣mancy still with him. Libels, or Libri famosi are to be forbidden, blasphemous books to be abolisht, but Magical books are to be burnt, Act. 19.19.

The Alchymists or Chymicks too much extoll their spirits. The chiefest Chymicks among the Ancients,Prudentissimè cuidam de suit spiritibus glo∣rianti, re∣spondisse fet∣tur Angliae Regina Eli∣zabetha; si spiritus puri essemus, solis quoque spiritibus curari & nutriri possemus.

The Jews hold, that Moses received a double Law from God in the Mount, one in writing, or delivered in writing, the other by mouth, or delivered by mouth. This last (say they) was successively delivered by Moses to posterity, first to Joshua, by him to the Elders, and by them to the first Prophets, and then to the last Pro∣phets, amongst whom the last of all were Zachary, Haggai, Malachi, these de∣livered it to the men of the great Synagogue, which were Ezra with his company, who restored the Law to its ancient purity, from whom the wise men following re∣ceived it in succeeding generations, and this double Exposition which the Jews glo∣ry in is yet found among their wise men, they name the Cabala. Joannes Picus de Mirandula first amongst the Latines made mention of this Ca∣bal of the Hebrews. Because there are six Alephs in the first verse of the first Chapter of Genesis, and Aleph signifies a thousand, therefore they say the world shall last six thousand years.

COnstat Graecos & Latinos peregrinae linguae voces, dum suae lingua dece∣ro, & compositioni student, prodigiosè corrupisse. Leland. Comment. in Cigu. Cant. Languages do often much change in processe of time. The French, Spanish and Italian, coming from the Latine are much fallen from the puri∣ty of the Latine tongue. None of the French will now understand the Laws of England published by William the Conqueror in the Norman without an Inter∣preter. Languages differ much in common names, but not in proper; all Languages say almost in the same manner, Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, Socrates, Plato, Caesar, C. Caro, Carolus, and in the like. The Confusion of Languages was brought in at the building of the Tower of Babel,Peccati poena est tot esse lin∣guas, Lud. Viv. de Trad. Dis∣cip. l. 3. as Moses the Hebrew Prophet in the 11th Chapter of Genesis, and Josephus the Hebrew Historian in the 4th Chapter of his first book of Jewish Antiq. evident∣ly demonstrate. The punishment of strange Languages was a heavy punishment, next to our ca∣sting out of Paradise, and the Flood. Mr Wheat. Protot. ch. 7.
The holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles in the shape of tongues. Quid autem lingua dissecta aliud (saith one) quam variarum linguarum cognitionem por∣tenderunt? Bibliander saith, There are seventy seven Languages commonly reckoned, De ratione communi omnium Linguarum, c. 1. The Hebrew Language was the first and most ancient,Varia lingua∣rum genera & permulta qui∣dem, sive septuaginta duo, sive plura vel pauciora jam inde ab aedificatione Turris extitisse pro comperto habetur. Imm ut alii volunt ex illa aedificatione seu potius insania, tanta hominum sermonis varietas, linguarumque confusio innata est, ut quot orbis regiones sunt tot hominum linguae sint: prius enim universa terra, teste Moyse, labii unius erat. Ang. Roch. De Append. Bib. Vatic. de Dialect. and the onely Language before the building of the Tower of Babel. Ansten saith, It is better to be in the company of a known dog, then in a mans society whose speech is unknown to us.Linguarum diversitas ho∣minem alienat ab homin, nam si duo sibimet invicem siant obviam, neque praeterite, sed simul esse aliqua necessitate cogantur, quorum neuter norit linguam alterius, facilius sibi animalia muta etiam diversi generis, quàm illi cùm sint homines ambo sociantur, & quando enim quae sentiunt inter se communicate non possunt, propter solam linguarum diversi∣tatem nihil prodest ad consociandos homines tanta similitudo naturae: Ita ut libentius homo sit cum cane suo quam cum homine alieno. August. l. 19. De civit. Dei, c. 7. The Hebrew tongue kept its purity, and remained uncorrupted, though other tongues were added to it, and derived from it. It is reported of Mithridates, that he spake two and twenty Languages.Mithridatem Ponti regem solum morta∣lium viginci duabus linguis locutum cer∣tum est. Gesueri Mithridates De differentiis linguarum. Animo fuit excultissimo: quippe non Graecis, nec vulgaribus tantùm litteris eruditus: sed, quod permirum sit ac omnino rarum & inauditum, viginti duarum gentium quas dictioni suae subjectas habebat linguas ita percalluit, ut cum earum hominibus sine interpet nn minus scite, quam si inde fuisset oriundus, loqui militésque sine monitore sautare & appel. are potuerit.

Godesohalcus Praetorius, a man of great wit and vast memory, and famous in all kinde of Learning, once a singular ornament of the University of Francford in Germany, understood fourteen Tongues, saith Neander in the first part of his Geo∣graphy. Postell shews, that he was skilfull in fifteen Languages. Schindler and De Dieu were Polyglottists. Joseph Scaliger and our Bishop Andrews had also knowledge in severall Lan∣guages. Theodorus Bibliander De Ratione Communi omnium Linguarum, cap. 1. saith thus of himself, Equidem ut de uberiori aliqua perfusione divini spiritus gloriari non possum nec debeo, ita beneficia Christi servatoris minimè vel modestum, vel religiosum est dissimulare.

As the confusion of tongues at Babel had caused the casting off of the Gentiles,
by severing them from the participation of the true Religion (which was onely professed and known in the Hebrew tongue) so was the gift of tongues to be a needfull means to bring them into Religion again; when every one may hear of the things of God in his own Language. The Languages may be divided into Oriental and Occidental: 1. Oriental; Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriack, Arabick, Aethiopick, Persian, Armenian, Coptick. 2. Occidental; Greek, Latine, Spanish, French, Italian, German, English, and Scla∣vonick, which is spoken very generally. The Oriental tongues are written and read from the right hand to the left, ex∣cept the Aethiopick and Armenian. The Grecians at first did write forward and backward, whence that phrase, Li∣teras exarare and lineae, are called versus, and thence that was a most profitable and grave Decree of the Councel of Vienna,Vide Bocharti Geog. sac. celebrated under Clement the 5th, That there should be in Universities publick professours of the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabick tongues, which should teach them, and translate books out of them into Latine for the propagation of the Faith, and more easie conversion of the In∣fidels. Sigismundus Gelenius hath written Lticum Symphonum. Quo quatnor Linguarum Europae familiarium, Gracae scilicet, Latinae, Germanica, ac Sclavinicae concordia judicatur. Bibliander De ratione communi omnium linguarum, layes down an easie me∣thod of learning a Language, Qui enim dictiunculas principales, & themata singulis diebus discat, & aliquid tribuat regulis derivandi, flectendi, & componendi, utque ordinem & constructionis leges cògnoscat, centesimo die per otium linguam per∣didicit. He saith there, That there are a thousand original words of the Latine tongue, and themata bis mille linguae Hebraeae, two thousand roots of the Hebrew tongue. There are three principal or learned Languages, the Hebrew, Greek and Latine. 1. Of the Hebrew Of Languages, the Hebrew as it is the first and most ancient of all, so it alone seems to be pure and sincere,Nostri etiam seculi omnes propemodum docti, primas linguae He∣braeae deferunt, excepto unico Goropio Be∣cano, qui Belgicam suam principem antiquitate asserere, sed frustra & admodum languide, allaborat. Crinesiò Discursus de confusione Linguarum, cap. 1, Vide plura ibid. Ut Bibliad. de Ratione Communi omnium lin∣guarum, cap. 5. It is most certain that the Hebrew langage from the beginning of the world to this present, never received any alteration or corruption in its dialect or manner of speech. See Jerom in his Preface to the Prophet Jeremiah, in his last Epistle to Paulus Urbicus, and in his Exposition on the third Chapter of Zephany. Rechlin in his Book of the Jews Cabala. Augustinus Steuchus in his Annotations on the 37 Chapter of Genesis, and divers others quoted by Duret, Histoire Des Langues De cest univers. all the rest almost are mixt: for there is none of them which hath not certain words derived and corrupted from the Hebrew. So the Latines have not onely borrowed many words of Art from the Grecians, but also of things which they found in their books. So the Latine tongue was corrupted by the Gothes in Italy, France and Spain. Some think that the English Language is most mixt and corrupt of all. Munster in the second Book of his universal Cosmography, saith, The English tongue is compounded of many Languages. In times past (he saith) it was pure Germane, as one may know by Beda, who was born in England. Hac Hebraica sive Judaica lingua quae & sacra dicitur, Vetus Testamentum conscriptum fuit. Profecto Liber fere solus purus Hebraicus habetur, ut eruditi affirmant: alii enim iisdem Characteribus Conscripti vel Chaldaici sunt, vel alias dialectos & glossas habent admi∣xtas. Ang. Roch.

The antiquity of it demonstrates its dignity, the simplicity and grace of it its plea∣sure.
It is the fountain of all other Languages, of the Indian, Persian, Babylonian, Armenian, Syriack, Arabick, the Egyptian, Aethiopick, and therefore profita∣ble. Beckman shews, that many Greek words are derived from it.Nulla enim est lingua, quae non ab He∣braica derivata quaedam & corrupta voca∣bula habeat. Gesneri Mi∣thridates.

By it we are instructed in the knowledge of God and the Church, and our selves, therefore it is very necessary. The Punique tongue was the Canaanitish or old Hebrew See Brerewoods Enquiries, ch. 7. Language, that which was vulgarly spoken among the Jews before the Captivity. Amongst Christians for more then a thousand years from Christ, none scarce did adorn the Hebrew Language unlesse very few. The Jews were in such hatred, that their very Language was vilified. Origen of Alexandria learned it of a Jew called Hill, not without trouble, and the publick upbraiding of Celsus. Jerom also of Stridona a Monk and Presbyter, learned this Language at Bethlehem, espe∣cially in the night time of a Jew, fearing his Countreymen, whose name was Bar∣hanina, whence Ruffinus becoming his enemy objected to him, that leaving Christ he followed Barabbas, He neglecting that calumny went on stoutly, and taught many religious Virgins this Language, that they might sing Hebrew Psalms. After Jerom, who flourished in the year of Christ 385. followed John Damascene, who li∣ved in the year of Christ, 730. Nicholas Lyra was converted from Judaism in the year of Christ, 320. Afterward Paulus Burgensis was converted from Ju∣daism. And this was the lot of that holy Language even unto the year of Christ 1440. when Printing was invented, and the studies of Languages and Learning began to flourish. Here among the Christian restorers of the holy tongue Reuclin was the first. He learned the Greek tongue of Greek exiles (amongst whom was Chalcondylas) and the Hebrew of the Jews, and he illustra∣ted both. The ice being broken by him, Hebrew Bibles were printed first at Pi∣sauna, after at Venice, and in Italy. Faelix Pratensis, Daniel Bombergus his master in the holy tongue, the Author and Moderator of his famous printing in the He∣brew, much adorned this Language, by publishing Hebrew Bibles, which are cal∣led Veneta & Bombergiana. Augustinus Justinianus Nebriensis Episcopus put forth Psalterium octaplum. Petrus Galatinus flourished in Spain, also Franciscus Ximenes Archbishop of Toledo, and Cardinal, who procured the Edition of Opus Complutense, & Benedi∣ctus Arias Montanus Hispalensis, who being helped together with his Collegues by the munificence of Philip the second King of Spain, promoted that kingly work, the Spanish and Plantine Bible. In France Sanctes Pagninus Lucensis professed this tongue, The Author of the Treasury of the Hebrew tongue, Franciscus Vatablus, which incouraged and fur∣thered Robert Stevens in printing so elegantly the Hebrew Bible at the charge of Francis the first King of France. John Mercer who together with Bonaventure Cornelius Bertram and Antonius Cevallerius inriched Pagnines Treasury with An∣notations. To these may be added William Postell and Nicholas Clenard, who travelled far out of their love to the Hebrew and Oriental tongues. In Germany after Capnio or Reuchlin, Conrads Pellican, Sebastian Munster, John Oecolampadius, Luther, Aurogallus, Forster, Zigler, John Albert Widman∣stadius, Andraeas Masius, Paulus Fagius, John Avenarius, John Drusius, Waser, John Buxtorf the Father and Sonne, George Cruciger, and others bestowed their pains to good purpose in this Language.

Wal. Epist. Walae Gomarus.During the seventy years Captivity of the Jews in Babylon, there was a mixture of the Hebrew and Chaldee Language, as is evident by the writings of the Prophet Daniel, composed of both, as Jerom hath well observed in his Preface upon that Prophet, as also by the writings of Ezra, and more evidently in the Chaldee Paraphrases. The Syriack and Chaldee are as it were but dialects of the Hebrew (differing not much more then Northern and Western speech from plain English) and though they be nearly allied to the Hebrew, yet they are nearer one to the other, insomuch that some reckon them both one. Those Christians are a terrour to the Jews who are indifferently skilled in the Thargum and the Rabbins, for they know that many pillars of Judaism are most vehemently shaken, yea overthrown in them. The more the pity that these most profitable studies are so neglected in those places where the Jews most resort. Many Christians in Syria use this Language in Grammaticis & sacris about the mountain Libanus. The Samaritan Language. Totidem ver∣bis quot Ju∣daei, ne una quidem mi∣nus, au am∣plius, Penta∣teuchum legunt. Et quod caput est, literis non adulterinis, ut Judaei, sed meris Mosaicis characteribus, ut planè à Postello proditum est, & res ipsa loquitur. Scalig. De emendat. Temp. lib. 7.It hath no other letters and characters proper to it, but the Hebrew letters and characters, yet most ancient. Many Jews at this day dwelling in Syria, and chiefly in the Town of Sichem, use this Samaritan Language, which are called Sama∣ritans. The Syriack tongue, which is very like to the Hebrew, witnesseth that the He∣brews have two and twenty letters, for they also have two and twenty in sound alike, but divers characters. The Samaritans also write the Pentateuch of Moses in so many letters; and it is certain that Ezra after the taking of Hierusalem, and the restauration of the Temple under Zorobabel, found out other letters which we now use, when to that time the characters of the Samaritans, and the Hebrews were the same.

Waseri Comment. ad Mithrid. Gesn. the Sy∣rian Language, the old, The Aramites Language. The Syriack tongue is certainly thought to have had beginning in the time of the Captivity of the Jews in Babylon, while they were mingled among the Chaldeans. In which long revolution of seventy years, the vulgar sort of the Jews forgot their own language, and began to speak the Chaldee; but yet pronouncing it amisse, and framing it somewhat to their own Countrey fashion, in notation of points, affixes, conjugations, and some other properties of their ancient speech, it became a mixt Language of Hebrew and Chaldee. Brerewoods Enquiries touching the Diver∣sity of Languages and Religions through the chief parts of the world, ch. 9. Guido Fabricius clearly demonstrates the vulgar tongue of Jury in the dayes of our blessed Saviours pilgrimage here upon earth to be Syriack, which (saith Ma∣sius) grew out of the mixture of the ancient Chaldee and Hebrew, and was so dif∣ferent from the latter, that the one could not be understood by the other. The Preface to Brerewoods Enquiry. Crinesius commends the Syriack Grammer of Mafius, Mercer, Tremellius and especially Wasers. But De Dieu's is an excellent one. Of the Arabick.

It is of larger extent now then any other Language, almost the third part of the habitable world acknowledgeth it. Although I be farre from their opinion, which write (too overlashingly) that the Arabian tongue is in use in two third parts of the inhabited world, or in more, yet I finde that it extendeth very farre, and specially where the Religion of Mahu∣med is professed.

It is an elegant Language whether we consider the plentie of words, and the force of signification, or the sweetnesse of the phraseology, or the facility and gravity of the whole Language. All these particulars Erpenius proves in his first Oration. De Ling. Arab. and Mr Greaves saith, it exceeds both the Greek and Latine in number of words. Vide Pocock. Not. Miscel. in portam Mosis.4. It is a profitable Language. He that hath the knowledge of this Language, may travell without an Interpreter almost all over Africa and Asia. There are many words in the Hebrew Bible, and the most ancient and profitable Chaldee Translation of it, and many manners of speaking whose signification and sense cannot be had but out of this Language. Without the knowledge of this Lan∣guage, how shall the impious opinion of Mahomet be either fully known or refuted? It gives great light to the Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian, and other Languages, to the Mathematicks,Nulla, mi Lector, lingua est (Graecam & Latinam excipio) quae plura solidae eruditionis & encyclopaediae monumenta continet.

Id. ibid. they having invented the Algebra, and having Mathemati∣cians more acurate then Ptolomy, to Physick, Avicenna, Mesua, Serapio, Rasis were famous Physicians.

Ingentes Historiarum co∣pias habent, obscurae & sepultae jam antiquitati lucem vitamque allaturas. Poetarum illis seges densissima est, ut nullibi terrarum major ingeniorum messis provenerit, saith Mr Greaves in his Oration. He commends it also for its facility, for here are no dialects at all, no turnings of flexions, no anomalies. Mercer, Joseph Scaliger, Francis Rophelengius, Isaac Casanbone, Emanuel Tremelius, and Francis Junius, Clenard, Golius, and our Pocock and Graves highly prized this Language, and promoted the study of it. The Arabians (saith Bedwell) translated the Syriack Testament not the Greek, as it will appear by many places to him that shall compare them, whence those things which are very well rendred by the Syriack, are also rendred ad verba by the Arabick, where the Syriack hath erred, there also the Arabick hath much more missed the mark. Of the Ethiopick or Indian Language. Graeci Aehio∣piam dicunt ab , uro, &  visus, fa∣cies, solis enim vicinitate in∣colae ejus regionis ita torrentur, ut atro sint colore, adeoque immutabili.

Postellus.It is so near (saith Bibliander, De Ratione Communi omnium linguarum, cap. 2.) to the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabick, that there is scarce any diction which is not found in some of them. The Ethiopians are descended from Chus the sonne of Cham. It proceeds almost wholly from the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack and Arabick. They write from the left hand to the right. It hath a great passage through all the Kingdom of Ethiopia and Africk, which is of great extent. Some think the Pro∣phets
were written in the Ethiopick tongue from the times of our Saviour Christ, and his Apostles, and that the Eunuch (who was Treasurer under the Queen of Candace) read it, by which Eunuch also afterward all Ethiopia was converted to the faith of the Gospel. Of the Persian Language. There are many footsteps of the Persian Language in the Scripture, especially in Esther, as Ahashuerus, Esther, Hammedetha, Phur or Phurim, Gaza, Susa, Zeres,Hac de Lin∣gua nihil pror∣sus possideo, sed eandem jam excolere coepit vir aliâs excellentissi∣mus in Linguis Anatolicis, Dn.

Mr Graves hath written of it, Persica lingua in tota ferè Asia hodiè locum habet, ut in occidente Latina, saith Waserus in his Commentary on Gesners Mithri∣dates. Of the Coptick Kircherus hath written. Of the chief Oriental Languages, Arabick, Armenian, Syriack and Ethiopick hath Petrus Victor, Cajetanus Palma written, and Ludovicus De Dieu a Grammar of them. Of the Greek Language. It is a most elegant, rich and copious Language,There are seve∣ral Orations in the commen∣dation of the Greek Tongue by Heresba∣chius, Hoelz∣lin, D. Pri∣deaux. Heinsius. Graeca lingua est erudita ad∣modum & locuples. Et quemadmodum Latina lingua alias potest copia sua instruere ac juvare, sic Graeca tum Latinam ipsam, tam alias quoque auget & adornat: Estque perfectioni Latinitatis necessaria, non secus quàm Latina Italicae aut Hispanicae. Nec ullus absolutè suit Latini sermonis peritus, nisi & Graeco imbutus. Ex sermone enim Graeco Latinus, ex Latino Italus Hispanus & Gallus manarunt, quibus olim nationibus Latina lingua erat vernacula. Bibliander. De ratione Communi omnium linguarum. Ingenium Graiis dedit ore rotundo. Musae loqui.

Id. ibid. and very usefull for understand∣ing of the Scripture and other Arts. The Old Testament was translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and the New Testament was wholly written by the Apostles in this Language. Many Greek Fathers also have commented on the Scripture, or defended Religion by Theolo∣gical Treatises. Grammatica, Dialectica, Rhetorica, Arithmetica, Musica, Geo∣metria, and many Chronological words have come from the Greek. Many terms in the Mathematicks cannot be understood without it. The Greeks in their Liturgie have no Latine speech, but the Latines have divers Greek speeches in theirs. An evident proof, that the Latines have received of the Greeks the Christian Religion, and have been their Disciples. As this appears by the History of the Acts of the Apostles, where we may see the Christian Religion passed from Syria to the Greeks, and from the Greeks into Italy, and to Rome.Anatomie De La Messe, l. 5. c. 14. Thence it comes, that the most part of words used in Religion amongst the we∣stern Christians are Greek, as those of Christ, Church, Apostle, Evangelist, Ba∣ptism, Eucharist, Bishop, Deacon, Exorcist, Monk, Letany, Antiphonie, Chrisme. Rom. 1.14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and Barbarians, that is,Vide Drusium ad Roman. 8.15. to all Nati∣ons under heaven, bottoming his speech from the phrase of the Grecians,Graeca Lin∣gua diutius est syncera & pura conservata, quàm nostra, quòd illa barbararum nationum incursus minùs sensit, quam occidens. Ludov. Viv. De Trad Disc. lib. 3. which gave the style of Barbarous for distinction sake, unto all the Nations, even the Romans, beside themselves.
The Greek Language is difficult by reason of the many Dialects, the Attick common,In Graeca lin∣gua magni sunt recessus, & vastissimi Labyrinthi, non solum in∣dialectis va∣riis, sed in unaquaque illarum. Attica & Atticae proxima com∣munis maximè sunt necessariae, propterea quòd & sunt facundissimae atque excultissimae: & quicquid Graeci ha∣bent legi ac cognosci dignum, istis dialectis est consignatum. Reliquis utuntur authores caminum, quos non tanti est intelligi: praesertim quum non in dialectis modo, sed in apellandis rebus, & colore loquendi tantum sic inter orationem numeris solutam & adstrictam discriminis, ut non videatur esse eadem lingua. Bibliander de Ratione Communi omnium Linguarum & Literat. cap. 4. Graeca Lingua quinque distinguitur dialectis, Aeolica scilicet, Attica, Ionica, Dorica & communi.

Eolick, Ionick and Dorick. The Attick Dialect is the most elegant and usefull; the Dorick was the most gross, therefore the Eclogues and conferences of Shepherds were written by Theocritus in that Language: Yet Petrus Mosella∣nus Orat. de Var. Ling. Cognit. saith, Adsit ingenium foelix, non desit discendi pro∣positum constans, contingat & praeceptor non dectus solùm, sed & prudens, vel meo ipsius periculo polliceri ausim, minori & tempore, & negotio mediocrem utriusque lin∣guae cognitionem posse percipi, quàm hodiè linguae semel latinae miseranda discitur balbuties. Cato being old learned Greek, as Origen did Hebrew. Vide Aul. Gell. Noct. Att. l. 11. c. 16. & Tur∣neb. Animadv. l. 5. c. 19.There is no Language so happy in composition, as the Greek, so fit in joyning and coupling one word with another as it, as Julius Pollux a Greek Author in his Onomasticon evidently demonstrates. All the Hebrew and Latine eloquence know not with their mystery, gravity, copiousness and eloquence, to express and utter so properly and naturally many Nowns and Verbs as are to be found frequently in the Books of Greek Au∣thours. Greek Books, (in very deed, if any after the sacred) are best able to make a man Wise and Learned. Dr Casaub. of Enthus. c. 2. At this day the Greek Tongue is very much decayed, not only as touching the largeness of it, but also in the pureness and elegancy of the Language; though it was preserved pure longer then the Latine.Thresor de L' Histoire Des Langues. De Cet univers. Par Duret. pag. 674. De couplements de mots Grecs. Brerewoods Enquiries touching the di∣versity of Languages, cap. 2 Picus Mirandulanus, Hermolaus Barbarus, Bembus, Politian, were famous Ita∣lians,In Graecis au∣thoribus Xe∣nehontis Cyrus, & So∣cratici Com∣mentarii, & Herodotus, & Thucydides, & Demosthe∣nes, & Aristotelis libri de moribus, & de Repub. & Homerus, atque Hesiodus.

Sturmii Nobilitas Literata. well skild in the Greek. By the pains of Theodorus Gaza, Luscaris, Musorus, Cretensis, Chalcondiles, Argyropylus, Trapezuntius, Chrysoloras, the Greek tongue was wonderfully spread. Sthwartzerd was called from the Greek Melancthon, Newman, Neander, Church∣yard, Polyander, Freeman, Luther, ab , Reuelin, Capnio. The Germane tongue hath many words purely Greek, as Neander in the first part of his Geography shews. Doctissimus ille quondam praeceptor meus Johannes Camerarius Dalburgius, Eccle∣siae Vvormaciensis reverendissimus antistes, aliquot millia dictionum Graecarum colle∣gerat, quae in utraque lingua Graeca & Germanica idem significant. Bibliand. de Ra∣tione communi omnium Linguarum c. 2. The French tongue hath a great conformity with the Greek, as both Joach. Peri∣onius de Linguae Gall. cum Graeca cognat. and Henry Stevens in that Book entituled Conformité de Language Francois avec le Grec. abundantly shew. So hath the English also divers words from them, as I have elsewhere de∣clared.
All Learning and Wisdom is contained in the Greek Language.Quia verò in Graeca lingua suavissima, dulcissima, elegantissima, & ornatissima omnis erudita doctrina & sapientia fuit tradita, cum Deus in illa gente, quicquid literarum, artium, doctrinae ac sapientiae literatae uspiam esset, deposuisset, caepit illa lingua propagati, tum per Graecorum colonias, tùm etiam aliis rationibus per omnes fero genes omnium partium orbis terrae adeò ut non modo Scythis, Indis, quod ex Philostrato patet, sed Germanis etiam quod Willichius in Commentariis suis eruditis in Cornelium Tacitum annotavit.

It is one of the three Learned Tongues,Legendi scri∣ptores Classici quales è Lati∣nis praecipuè sunt Cicero, Caesar, Teren∣tius, scriptor, ut ad nomen, ipsum alluda∣mus, terendus adolescentiae noctu, diuque Vossius de Phi∣lologia, cap. 6.

Quaero item, quid un saltem Varoni respon∣deas: qui quidem sicuti Ciceroni palmam concedit orandi causas: ita Latine loquendi sibi retinet. Quaero etiam: an quasi barbaros quosdam rejicias: Livium, Sallustium, Quintillianum, Senecam, Plinium quoque utrumque, multos alios paeterea tot saeculorum suffragiis comprobatos. Polit. Epist. l. 5. Epist. 1. in comparison of which all others are said to be barbarous. Some hold that the flourishing, pure and incorrupt age of the Latine Tongue was from Terence, even to the times of Quintilian. This age had Terence, Pacuvius the Poet, Lucretius and Archias Poets, Varro, Cicero, Julius Caesar, Virgill, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, Ovid, Salust, Columella, Livy▪ Quintus Curtius, Persius, Seneca, Silvius Italicus, and Martiall. Under Augustus Caesar the Latine tongue was most pure. Vide Becmanni Manuduct. ad Ling. Lat. c. 6. concerning the pure Latine Au∣thours, and c. 7. what Authours are most to be read, and also some Elogies of the Latine Tongue by divers Learned men. Paesquier Recherches de la France l. 9. c. 29. reckons up the Authours which ex∣celled in the Latine Tongue. The Latine Tongue grew to perfection by certain degrees, and in Caesar and Cicero's times (whereof the one for purity, the other for copiousness were the best that ever writ) it came to the highest flourish together with the Empire. Among the Poets, Plautus, Naevius, Accius, Pacuvius, Ennius and Virgill most refined it, among the Orators and Historians M. Cato, Sisenna, Caesar and Cicero. The Spanish Writer of the Book which is called the Triall of Wits, ch. 4. col∣lects thence, that there is a speciall agreement of the Latine Tongue with the rea∣sonable soul, because mad men which never learned Latine, nevertheless sometime speak it of their own accord. The Latine Tongue is usefull for all Arts Lingua La∣tina non uni vel arti, vel genti servit: sed omnibus quaecunque sunt, ubicun{que} sunt, & artibus & generibus. Quicquid olim latuit in scri∣niis sive Hebraicis, sive Graecis, sive aliis, in Latinum idioma conversum est. Beckm. Manuduct. ad Ling. Lat. c. 2. Haec cum nuspiam hodie vernacula aut materna sit, ideo ab ineunte statim aetate pueris discenda datur. Hac, quod∣cunque sit, in Scholis & Academiis docetur Hac, quasi vinculo, tam variae, tam dissitae copulantur nationes. Id. ibid. and Nations. Julius Scaliger and Joseph his sonne hold, that the Originals of the Latine speech are many of them drawn from the Greek. Crinesius de Confusione Linguarum cap. 10. proves by many instances, that the Latine Tongue proceeded from the Hebrew. It is very commendable to speak good Latine freely, and to write in a pure and elegant style. That is much which Fanchimus Fortius Ringelbergius Postremo animum ad∣junxi ad curā Latinè ac po∣litè scribendi, cujus gloria inter humanos conatus omneis summum tenere locum videtur.

Ling. cap. 10.Brerewood conceives these tongues are more ancient, and that they have not sprung from the corruption of the Latine Tongue, by the inundation and mixture of barbarous people in these provinces, but from the first unperfect impression and receiving of it in those forraign Countries. One of the Councels cals the French Tongue Linguam Romanum rusticam, whence Romances, because they were written in that Tongue. The genuine pronunciation and reading is the most difficult in the French Tongue, for many letters which are written, are not pronounced, or otherwise pronounced. Crinesius in his Discourse of the Confusion of Languages, c. 10. gives seven ge∣nerall rules of the French pronunciation, and many speciall ones. There are many severall Dialects of the French Tongue. Nam in Gallia certè nostra, tot ferè linguae sunt, aut certè tot ejusdem linguae dialecti, ac diversi pronun∣tiandi modi, quot sunt Galliae, non dicam provinciae, sed urbes. Casaub. Comment. in l. 4.

That the Propheticall and Apostolicall Writings might be preserved in them, from corruption or destruction, which is the cause why Libraries were alwaies wont to be added to these Schools, in which other Books being written out faith∣fully in Hebrew, Greek, and Latine were kept. 2. That there might be perpetuall witnesses in Schools which might testifie by
a continuall succession, what Books were truly Canonicall and what Apo∣cryphall. 3. That these Schools might also testifie what was the native and genuine sense of such Writings, and what doctrine was truly Apostolicall. The last cause was, That from those Colleges those might be drawn out which were indeed fit to teach others, and to govern Churches. The whole Kingdom of Israel was filled with Theologicall Schools, according to the commandement of God.

In Ramah the Prophets dwelt with the Students, which were called Sonnes of the Prophets. Amos saith, I am not a Pro∣phet, nor the sonne of a Prophet, that is, I was never taught in the Schools of the Prophets, and the Learned. Vide Altiug. Hist. Academ. Hebr.They had Schools amongst the people till the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jews being dispersed among other Nations, alwaies endeavoured to keep their Schools, which they called Synagogues, which were Colledges, as it were, in which the Law of God was interpreted among the more Learned, and wherein they con∣ferred and disputed about the Scriptures, Act. 6.9. In Ecclesiasticall Histories we may see this care of the Apostles and their Disci∣ples in setling Schools every where where Churches were built,Certè honesta professorum stipendia, non minus nervi sunt Schola∣rum, quam pecuniae belli. Zanch. in 2da Orat. and in setting over them such men as were indued with singular piety and Learning. Hence those most famous Schools of Antioch, Alexandria and Constantinople, and many others in the East, and also in the West, which were indowed by Emperours and Kings with most ample rewards, priviledges and all kinde of benefits, that the pure Do∣ctrine might be continued in them. The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Persians, Grecians, Romans, set up Schools,Honos alit ar∣tes, omnesque incenduntur ad studia glo∣ria. and by great liberality and other waies promoted Learning, and incou∣raged Schollars. Vide Lipsi Lovanium l. 3. c. 6, 7, 8. Quintilian in the second Chapter of his first Book, Instit. Orat. handleth this Question, Vtiliusne sit domi atque intra privatos parietes studentem continere, an frequentiae scholarum & velut publicis praeceptoribus tradere: Whether children be more profitably taught at home, or in some publick School. Ante omnia, (saith he) futurus orator, cui in maxima celebritate & in media Reipublicae luce vivendum est, assuescat jam à tenero non reformidare homines, neque illa solitaria & velut umbratili vita pallescere. Necesse est enim sibi nimium tribuat, qui se nemini comparat. Adde quòd domi ea sola discere potest quae ipsi praecipientur, in Schola, etiam quae aliis. Audiet multa quotidie probari, multa corrigi, proderit alicujus objurgata de∣sidia: proderit laudata industria: excitabitur laude aemulatio: turpe ducet cedere pari, pulchrum superasse majores. Accendunt omnia haec animos: & licet ipsa viti∣um sit ambitio, frequenter tamen causa virtutum est. Matricularii vocabantur, quorum nomi∣na Matriculae inscripta. Matricula verò est nominum catalogus, vel regestum, pro quo vulgo registrum di∣cunt. In Academiis Matriculam appellant codicem, in quem referuntur nomina omnium Academicâ fruentium libertate. Cui cùm inscribuntur, studiorum gratiâ, in Academiam missi, dicuntur matriculari. Vossius de vitiis Sermonis. lib. 3. cap. 24.Immediatly after Schollars come to the University, they are matriculated, and then they enjoy the priviledges of the University. They are called Undergraduates till they receive a degree, after Graduati, or in better Latine, In gradu aliquo dignitatis constituti.
The first degree with us is that of Bachelor of Arts, which they cannot attain usually before four years standing, or near it.Baccalaureus à baccis lauri compositus putur, sed potius corru∣ptum censeo ex batualius: ut sit à batu∣endo, ex quo batailie. Batua∣lij verò fuerint vocati, quia jam quasi batuissent cum adversario, ac manus conseruissent: hoc est, publicè disputasserent, atque ita peritiae suae specimen dedissent. Vossius De vitiis Sermonis l. 1. c. 19. Three years after they may (if they be sufficient Schollars) take the Degree of Masters of Arts, which are Doctors, as it were of the Arts, and therefore a Master of Art takes place of a Doctor of Musick, because he is Doctor but of one Art. Seven years after they are Masters of Arts they may take the Degree of Bache∣lors of Divinity, and five years after, they may Commence Doctors of Divinity; so that they are almost of twenty years standing before they take that highest Degree. Of the Ceremonies used in creating of Doctors, Dr Prideaux speaks sufficiently in his Lectures. Alsted in his Encyclopaedia, l. 24. c. 13. and Junius in Academiis, handle the Uni∣versities after the Alphabeticall order of the severall Countries, and so beginning with Anglia, they first mention Oxford and Cambridge, then they mention Bohe∣mia, and in it Prague; then Denmark, in it Hafua; then France, in it Alsted mentions sixteen Universities; then Germany, where he rehearseth twenty five Universities; then Spain, there he reckons up twenty two Universities; then Italy, there eleven; three in Polonia, and three in Scotland. Junius speaks of Lusitania before Polonia, where he mentions Conimbra. Leukenor (our Coun∣tryman) in his Discourse of Universities, first begins with Germany high and low, and so goes on with Italy, France, Polonia, Prussia and Lituania, Bohemia and Moravia, Spain, England and Scotland. Middendorpius mentions them in this order, Italy, Sicily, Germany, Polonia, Spain, England, Scotland. CHAP. VIII. Of the Vniversities of Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. I Shall follow Leukenors method, (who is much beholding to Middendorpius and Neander) beginning with Germany, and ending with England, Scotland, and Ireland. I might speak also of the famous University of Athens, the Greece of Greece, as Thucidides cals it. It was the place where Rhetorick had its first birth,Vide Neandri Geog. partem 1am. Una urbe At∣tica pluribus annis elo∣quentiae, quam universa Graecia, operibusque floruit, adeo ut corpora gentis illius separata sint in alias Civitates, ingenia vero solis Atheniensium muris clausa existimes. Patero. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 18. and was brought to an height greater then it ever had in any place. In which one City in memory of one age, were more Learned men, and that in a manner altogether, then all time doth remember. In Philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Euclide and Theophrast. In Eloquence and Civil Law, Demosthenes, Aeschynes, Lycurgus, Dinachus, Demades, Isocrates, Isaeus, Lysias, Antisthenes, Androcides. In Histories, Thucydides, Xenophon. In Poetry, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes. It was the universall Study of all the world: one was not held Learned, (saith Munster in the 4th Book of his Universall Cosmography) who had not studied at Athens.
The Mathematicks excepted, which came rather from the Chaldeans and the Egy∣ptians, the whole flower of Arts and good Learning came from Greece. Of the Vniversities in Germany, High and Low.

He not only gave them full power and authority to conferre all degrees of Scholasticall honour to the Students therein, but also confirmed unto them by a publique Charter, the Priviledges of Paris. There are three Colledges, Collegium Montanum, Laurentianum, and Novum Coronarum. There is also another most famous publick Schola trilinguis, wherein the Hebrew, Greek and Latine tongues, and the Arts are also taught. Basil.

Neand. Geog. parte 1a.Dietherus of Eisenburg the Archbishop of Mentz was the Founder of this Uni∣versity in the year of our Lord 1482. wherein at the first beginning, all Arts in
generall were professed, but now only Philosophy, and the knowledge of the Tongues, and Divinity by the Jesuites. This City hath deserved no small praise and commendation of all Christendom, for that ingenious and most necessary Art of Printing, there first invented and put in practise by the famous and worthy Gentleman John Gutenberg, in the year 1459. Imprimit ille die quantum vix scribitur anno, O Germania muneris repertrix, Quo nihil utilius dedit vetustas, Libros scribere quae doces premendo. Wirtsburg. In the year of Salvation 1403. John the 2d of that name, and 55th Bishop of Wirtsburg, instituted therein an University, priviledged and authorized by Pope Boniface the 9th, and called thither out of the most renowned Schools of Christen∣dom, divers Learned Professors of Philosophy, Divinity, and other inferiour Studies. Trier. The University here is thought to be one of the oldest Academies in Europe, the Citizens thereof have no Record when it was first erected, by reason of the mani∣fold and often changes it hath endured. It appeareth manifestly by an Epistle of Gratian the Emperour to Antonius Regent of Gaule, that all Studies universally flourished in this City. Heidelberge. It is the Metropolis of the Palatinacy of Rheine,The taking of that famous Li∣brary in respect of many choice Manuscripts, and removing it to Rome was a great losse.

Rupertus the 10th Palatine of Rheine erected in this City an University, Anno Dom. 3346. which in succession of time grew to be reckoned among the most wor∣thy and famous Nurseries of the Arts. Pope Vrban the 6th confirmed the same with the Priviledges and Prerogatives of Paris. This Academy hath fostered many Learned men, as Rudolphus Agricola, Willi∣am Xilander, Thomas Erastus, Zachary Vrsin, Conradus Pellicanus Munsters Master, Pareus.

The other is situated near to the Oder, a goodly River, passing through the Dominion of the Marquess of Brandeburge, one of the seven Electors. Joachim Marquess of Branderburg, first founded in this later Frankford an Uni∣versity
in the year of Grace 1506. and bountifully provided for the maintenance thereof, indowing the same with large Revenews and rich Possessions: as it was afterward authorized by Pope Alexander the 6th, and by Pope Julius the 2d, and Maximilian the first of that name Emperour, enfranchised with many pri∣viledges. In this City the three Tongues are with great and profound Learning pro∣fessed: also the Civil Law, Physick, and the Mathematiques are there publikely taught. Reinerus Reineccius the great Historian lived here: Jacobus Ebertus who was Professor of Ethicks here, was a great Linguist. Rostoche. In the year of Christs Nativity 1415. the Princes of Mekleburge and the Citi∣zens of Rostoche obtained licence to erect in this City an University, wherein the Arts in generall have ever since been Learnedly professed. Gripswalde. About the year of our Lord 1456. lived herein a certain Learned Doctor of the Laws, which being Proconsul or Burgomaster of the Town, obtained for the same many goodly Priviledges and licence to erect an University, which being by him only begun, was perfected and enlarged by the great care and diligence of Philip Duke of Pomerland, in the year 1547. Friburge. In the year of our Saviour 1460. or as some say 1450. Albert Duke of Austria founded in this City an Academy, and liberally endued the same with large re∣venews and possessions. In the year 1467. this University received many Statutes and Ordinances from Vienna in : from whence also came many great and Learned Clerks, here publikely to  Theology, the Laws Civil, Canon, and the other Arts. And at length the Emperour Fredericke, in the year 1472. much augmented and increased the same: the chiefest Colledge herein, is that which is called Domus Sapientiae. Vdalricus Zasius a Lawyer taught here many years with great praise, and left di∣vers Commentaries upon the Civil Law. Martpurge. An University was instituted in this City about the year 1526. which was after∣ward repaired and reinstituted by Philip the Landgrave of Hesse, in the year 1536. It was authorized by Charles the 5th at Regensburge, who endued it with privi∣ledges of Vienna.

Vienna. It is the most renowned Metropolis and residence of the Archdukes of Austria, a City for wealth most opulent,Viennae clari fuerunt Wolf∣gangus Lazius Medicus & Historicus Ferdinandi Imperatoris, incredibili re∣rum cognitio∣ne ac lectione, multa varia{que} praestantissi∣mus, cujus multa egregia opera histori∣ca erudita ab illo conscripta prodiere in publicum. and for strength most invincible, the only Bull∣wark of the Christians against their perpetuall and barbarous enemy the Turk. This City is famous for the Citizens valiant holding out against the Turks siege in the year 1529. in which 8000 Turks were slain. See Mr. Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 978. In this City is a publick and famous University of great name, first founded and instituted after the rules of Rome and Paris, in the year 1239. by the Emperour Frederick the 2d, to the end he might leave unto his sonne Conradus, an Empire strongly guarded and defended with men Learned and skilfull in the Liberall Sci∣ences, which afterward Rudolphus the 4th, Albertus the 3d, and Leopoldus the 2d, three brothers, Archdukes of Austria, with sundry priviledges Enfranchised, and removed the same from the place wherein it first was instituted, near to the Palace of the Archdukes. These were famous men in Vienna, viz. Wolfgangus Lazius Medicus an Histo∣rian to the Emperour Ferdinand: also Julius Alexandrinus,Julius Alexan∣drinus cujus de medico & me∣dicina extant libri quinque opus valde eruditum.

Pantaleon tomo 2do virorum Germaniae il∣lustrium.Peurbachius and Regiomontanus, (those two famous Astronomers) were Pro∣fessors also of the Mathematicks here. In the year 1562. at the cost of Ferdinand Emperour, but by the study and un∣wearied labour of John Albertus Widmanstade, Chancellour of Orientall Austria, a Lawyer, and excelling in the knowledge of divers learned Languages, the New Testament was printed at Vienna in the Syriack Tongue, which Manuscript in that Language Moses Meredinerus a Priest brought out of Mesopotamia of greater Asia into Europe, sent for this purpose into those parts by Ignatius Patriarch of Antioch, that he finding a Patron who would undergo the charge, that written Copy might by Printing be dimulged among the Christians living in Syria and un∣der the Empire of the Turk, Persian and Tartarian, which are the three most potent Empires of Asia.

Lovaine. This is a pleasant City. John Duke of Brabant obtained of Pope Martin the 5th, the approbation of an University in this City,Urbs Lovani∣um urbs pul∣cherrima complexa in∣tra muros areas latè patentes, prata, vincas, hortos, per quam mediam praeterea fluvius Delalabitur. Neand, Geograph. parte 1a. Vide Lipsi Lovanium. Letters and good Discipline began there publickly to be taught about the year 1426.

In this City not long since was erected a famous University by Philip late King of Spain, and authorized with the priviledges of Lovaine, where Theology, Phi∣losophy, and the inferiour Arts are Learnedly professed. Liege. In this City flourished in times past a most famous and renowned Academy, wherein were Students at one time the children of nine Kings, twenty four Dukes, twenty nine Earls, besides the sonnes of many Barons and Gentlemen. It is at this day decated and almost utterly extinguished; only some triviall Schools for the institution of youth in the inferiour Studies are there remaining. Leiden. There is scarce a Country in the world, which in so little a space hath so many neat Towns as Holland. Leiden is one of the six capitall Towns of Holland,Tu Leyda ut vetustate tua meritò possis gloriari, ita illud in te po∣tissimum, quod musarum de∣cus & praesi∣dium merita sis appellari.

Magistratus hic construxit Hortum infinitis herbis refertum in gratiam medicinae studiosorum. Est & Theatrum Anatomicum, visu dignum Swertii Athen. Belg. and is beautified with many pleasant Medows, Gardens, Arbors and Wals round about it. Here was born John Bucold (alias John of Leyden) a Taylor, who played Rex in Munster. In this City was erected an University in the year 1575. by William Prince of Orange. They being there miraculously delivered from the Spaniards great Army, to shew their thankfulness erected this University and indowed it with goodly privi∣ledges, whereto were called from divers parts, Professors in all faculties, allowing them good stipends. Vide Boxhorn. Epist. Dedicat. ad Theat. Holland. It doth flourish now, and sundry Professors of the liberall Sciences are there maintained with liberall stipends. The first Professour there was Polyander. Justus Lipsius, Bonaventure Valcane, Francis Junius, Joseph Scaliger, Clusius Hinsius, Salmasius, and divers others taught here.
These things are considerable in the University: 1. The Physick-Garden, Is longe amaenissimus est, arboribus & stirpibus raris∣simis è longinquis regionibus huc advectis refertissimus. 2. The Anatomy-Theatre, where there is Mummie of Egypt, the Idols of the Heathens, Birds which came from China, and other far Countreys. 3. The Library, well stored with Books of Divinity, Law, Physick, Philo∣logy, Philosophy and Mathematicks, both printed and Manuscripts. There is Cata∣logus Biblio∣thecae publicae Lugduno-Ba∣tavae. At the end of which there is Catalogus Librorum Manusuriptorum, quos Josephus Scaliger Bibliothecae Leydensi legavit,  Libri MSS. Arabici, quos ex Oriente advexit I.

year of Salvation 1478. after he had gained the Regal Diadem: For the which he obtained at the hands of Pope Sixtus the 4th the priviledges of Bnonia. This Academy was afterward augmented and enlarged by King Christian the 3d, in the year 1498. and after him by Frederick the 2d, in the year 1549.

Hence there are so many Universities in Italy, as Rome, Ve∣nice, Padua, Bononia, Ferrara, Millan, Pavia, Turim, Florence, Pisa, Sienna, Medena, Naples, Salern. Here flourished the famous Oratours, Cicero, Hortensius and Antonius; the renowned Historians Livie, Tacitus and Salust; the memorable Poets, Virgil, Ovid, Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius; Plautus and Terence the Comedians; the Satyrists, Horace, Juvenal and Persius, Aeneas Silvius afterwards Pope Pius the 2d, Marsilius Patavinus, Petrarch, Angelus Politianus, Rodolphus Volaterra∣nus, Picus Mirandula, Guido Bonatus, Ariosto and Tasso, Sixtus Senensis, Bellarmine, Baronius, were Italians. Rome. It was so named from Romulus who layed thereof the first foundation.De Romanae urbis amplitu∣dine consulito Geogium Fa∣britium in sua Roma & Onu∣phrium Panuini∣um l. 1.

Nauclerus writeth, that Vrbane the 4th of that name, being Pope, was much grieved to see the course of Studies in the Roman Academy intermitted, and all good discipline neglected: wherefore immediately he caused to be sent for that fa∣mous and most learned Clerk Thomas of Aquine, to direct and govern it, who set∣ting aside all care and respect of worldly promotion, applied his minde wholly to reform, restore and adorn the fame: during which time, at the Popes intreaty he did write many excellent Commentaries upon divine and humane Philosophy. Pope Innocent the 4th ratified this University. Pope Clement the 5th in a Councel held at Vienna, ordained, That at Rome, or wheresoever the Pope in person should be
resident, the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabick tongues should publickly be taught. Pope Eugenius the 4th much adorned this Academy. Aelian, Grego∣ry the great, Aulus Gellius, Laurentius Valla, Aldus Manutius, and his sonne, Antonius Sa∣bellicus were Romans. There is a Book of An∣drew Schots De viris illustribus urbis Romae.

Id. ibid.Pope Nicholas the 5th, being himself a learned Prelate, highly favouring all learned men, did more labour in repairing and beautifying this glorious Academy then any of his Predecessours. Pope Leo the 10th exhibited liberal pensions to several learned men, which by their pains and industry upheld the glory of this renowned Academy. He sent into Turky for John Lascaris, who robbing all the Heathen Universities of their best and worthiest Authors, did therewith plentifully furnish and adorn the Roman Libraries. Sixtus the 4th builded in the Vaticane that famous and renowned Library, called Palatina. Venice. Italy is the face of Europe, Venice the eye of Italy.

Johannes Rovennas taught in Venice, from whom issued many excellent wits, which restored Schools and Discipline. After the Latine Tongue was again restored, Emmanuel Chrysoloras began to teach the Greek. Many other singular Scholars have taught and lived in this City, as Hermolaus Hermolaus Barbarus non minus rerum publicarum usu, quam eruditione praeditu.

Patavinus a minorite Frier, who wrote so learnedly in behalf of the Emperour against the Pope, and Francis Zaborella the Civilian, Maginus the Geographer, and divers others lived here. Bononia. It is the chief University of Italy, and the retiring place of the Popes. This University was first founded (say some) when Theodosius swayed the Sce∣pter of the Roman Empire, though others doubt of it.Gymnasium totius Europae antiquissimum atque celebra∣tissimum. Melch.

The Civil Law is much studied here, insomuch that from hence proceeded the fa∣mous Civilians. Johannes Andreas professed in this Academy the Law with great fame and esti∣mation. Az that bright shining lamp of Learning was here also a publique Professour of the Civil Law. Jo. Antonius Maginus was publick Professour of the Mathematicks.

Sundry learned Writers have proceeded from this Academy, as Felinus Sammae∣us, the Interpreter of the Canon-Law, Andraeas Alciatus, Theodorus Gaza, Alexander Guarinus, Caelus Calcanimus, to whom Rhodiginus dedicated his book of four and twenty ancient readings, Baptista Gnavinus, and Nocholaus Leonicenus, Peter Bembus his master, Johannes Manardus, Lilius Gyraldus, Alexander Sardus, Angelus Aretinus the famous Lawyer. Millan. This City is one of the greatest of Europe, it is seven miles in circuit. It hath by long and ancient custom enjoyed a free and publick University. It was very famous in Virgils time, who studied there, as some write. Demetrius Cydonius born in Thessalonica, forsaking his native Countrey, came to Millan,Virgilius Maro ibi litteris operam dedit.

In this place did Baldus reade his latest Lectures, for he died, and was buried in the Covent of the Friers minorites.
Turin a City of Pont. A goodly University was here erected by the Dukes of Savoy,Taurinum. which excelled all other Italian Academies, for their perfection in Typography, or the Art of Printing. Erasmus Roterodamus did in this University proceed Doctor of Di∣vinity, where he after became a publick Professour of the same. Florence in Hetruria, or Tuscia flos urbium Italicarum.

He caused to be sent for into Flo∣rence Argyrophilus a Grecian born, and at that time in the studies of Rhetorick and Philosophy singularly learned, to the end that the youth of Florence might by him be instructed in the Greek Tongue, and the Liberal Sciences. He entertain∣ed also in his house Marcilius Ficinus a Platonick Philosopher, him he entirely loved. This Academy was afterward by Lawrance De Medices his sons sonne, finished and brought to a full, absolute and flourishing perfection. This Laurence was a great lover of good Letters, he held Marsilius Ficinus (whom his grandfather had caused to come to Florence) in great esteem. He nourished in his house that excellent Scholar Angelus Politianus, who in his youth did first make the Grecian Poet Homer speak in the Latine Tongue. He entertained with liberal pensions and exhibitions, Demetrius Chalcondylas,Florentinus etiam fuit Franciscus Guiccardinus eruditissimus, ac facundissi∣mus scriptor, qui tum alia scripsit, tam etiam sui tem∣poris historiam elucubravit libris trigima.

Pope Paulus the third, although he daily heard in the Roman Academy, Pompo∣nius Laetus, a man excellently learned, yet was he exceedingly desirous to study in the Florentine University, because the Greek and Latine Tongues, together with the other Arts, were there professed with greatest sincerity and profound∣nesse. This Prince much augmented, and with great cost adorned the Library which his Grandfather Cosmus had erected near the Temple of St Mark: from whence of late time have been brought to light many excellent books, which long have lain obscured, and were to be found in no other place of Christendom, as Eusebius Caesariensis, Hierocles, and the works of Clemens Alexandrinus, and others. Another Library was in this City erected at St Laurence his Church, by Pope Clement the seventh. Pifa. A University was erected here about the year 1339. Not long after it began exceedingly to flourish, as appeareth by the many grave and reverend Doctors, which therein received their instruction and education, viz. Pope Eugenius the 3d. Also Raimerus and Bartholomeus, two deep and pro∣found Scholars of the Order of the Friers Predicants, whereof the one did write that egregious work of Pantheology: the other set forth The Summe of Cases of Conscience. There have been learned Professours in this University, Felinus Sandaeus, Franciscus Aretinus, who was held to be the most judicious Civil Lawyer of his time. Bartholus after be had proceeded in Bononia, did in the Pisan Academy (as him∣self
confesseth) publickly professe the Civil-Law, Cosmo de Medices restored again this Academy, which in  was exceedingly decayed. After him Laurence his Nephew so much adorned and augmented the same, that Volaterranus and Machiavel name him as the first Founder and Erector thereof. Sienna. Academia Senensis.

An University was here long since erected, as appeareth by the authentick testi∣mony of sundry learned Historiographers. Petrus Ancoranus confesseth, that himself being sent for by the Councell of Sienna, in the year 1357. did in this University three years publickly professe the Civil-Law. In the time of Pope John the second all manner of studies exceedingly flourished there. Panormitanus, Paulus Castrensis, Bartholomeus, Socinus, Philippus Decius, Hugo Senensis, and many others of great learning, did adorn this renowned Aca∣demy. In this City was born Aeneas Silvius, who afterward was Pope Pius the 2d, by whose bounty and benevolence this Academy was adorned with many priviledges. Francis Picolominy, after Pope Pius the 3d, and Sixtus hence sirnamed Senensis the greatest Scholar of the three, if not of all the age he lived in. There is a Colledge in it called Domus Sapientiae.

The Emperour Charles the Great did institute this famous University at the earn∣est suite and instigation of Alcninus,Lutetia duo∣decim millia domorum con∣tinet intra muros, praeter eos vicos qui sunt in pomoe∣riis, quorum capacitas longe urbem ipsam dicitur supera∣re. Domos autem illas no putaveris casas. Sunt enim plurimae quae aliquot hominum millia capere queant, in quibus scientiarum omnium, trium linguarum cultus, Eloquentiae exercitationes, superant auditorum fidem. Scalig.

That of the Sorbonists. Le Theatre Des Antiquites De Paris Par Jacques Du Breul.The King St Lewis by the Counsel of Robert of Sorbonne (which took his sir∣name, as they say, from the place of his Nativity) his Almoner and Confessour, resolved to erect a Colledge of Divines, which retains the name of Sorbonne. The most famous Doctors in Divinity have studied in this Colledge. The Pope Clement the 4th confirmed the foundation of this Colledge. Theologi Pa∣risienses pri∣mum totius Europae locum eo genere sibi vendicant, duo habent praecipuè Collegia, Sorbonam & Navarram, eoque confuere solent ex omnibus propè gentibus doctrinae percipiendae causa. Sleid. Comment. lib. 4.He that answers there continueth from morning to night. II. The Colledge of Navarre was founded by Joan Queen of France and Navar in the year of Grace 1304. She inriched likewise this Colledge with an excellent Library. The greatest part of the young Princes, Lords and Gentlemen in France are customarily nourished and instructed in this Colledge rather then another, as well for its pleasant situation and neatnesse, as because of its royal foundation. Petrus de Aliaco Chancellour of Paris hath bestowed so much on this Colledge, that he is esteemed as a second Founder.

Poictiers is the Metropolis of the Earldom of Poictou, for Antiquity, not infe∣riour to any Town of France, second to Paris, onely in greatnesse, power and majesty. In this City hath long flourished a most learned University,Andreas Tir∣aquellus was Governour of it. for the Civil-Law chiefly, of great fame and authority in degree and preheminence next to Paris. Scaliger in his Cities thus speaks of it, Si studium est animae: veniunt à corpore vires; Galliaque à meritis poscit nerumque sibi: Haec studiis, aliae belli exercentur amore. Pictavium est animus, caetera corpus erunt. It was erected under Charles the 7th King of France, and confirmed by Pope Eugenius the 4th. We read in the Ecclesiastical Histories, that St Hilary called the Apostle of A∣quitaine, first revealed unto this people the light of the Gospel, and became the first Bishop of Poictiers, his excellent writings sufficiently testifie his singular wisdom and learning.
Joannes Capnion and Christophorus Longolius were Professors here. Lions. The Arms of the City are a Lion, whence the name of the City in French Lyon.Lugdunum. Anno Dom. 830. In this City flourished an Academy of great fame and celebrity, which hath sent forth into the world many excellent men, renowned for their great learning and holinesse of life, as Irenaeus and Eucherius both Archbishops of Lions. Hic claruit Joannes Ger∣son, eam exer∣navit Petrus Toletus, Bar∣tholomaeus Argenterius, aliique magni nominis viri. Swertii Athen. Belg.This City is famous for John Waldus learned in the Scriptures, who opposed the Pope and his Doctrine, whence the Waldenses called by some Pauperes De Lugduno, the poor men of Lions. It was a Colony of the Romans. They erected a University here near the Church, and consecrated it to Minerva, Eloquence was chiefly adorned, and the youth was much exercised in learning it.

Golniai Itinerarium Bellico-Gallicum.A publick University was in this City erected by Lewis the second about that time that Rupertus Phaltsgrave of Rheine founded Heidelberg in Germany, which was about the year 1346. Others will have it to be founded in the year 1362. at which time Casimire erected Cracon in Polonia. It flourisheth in the study of the Latine especially. Henry Valoise Duke of Aniou, brother to King Charles the ninth, not long since with much industrious care, laboured to augment and restore the same: the which good work that he might the better perform, he with great mu∣nificence invited thither sundry excellently learned Scholars: amongst the which was Francis Baldwin, who therein to his everlasting memory did establish the pro∣fession of the Civil-Law. Bodine came out of this University. Avignion. I is an ancient City of Prouuence, situated on the bank of Rhodanus, wherein is an University of long continuance. Pope John the 22. transferred the Apostolick seat from Rome unto this City, after whom it remained there 74 years, or thereabout. The City and Church of Avignion are at this day immediately subjected to the Popes of Rome, who first became Lords thereof, by means of a certain Neapolitane Queen, who being indebted to the Church of Rome, resigned this City to the Bishops thereof, and his Successours for ever.

He taught the Law here.
Orleance. It is a rich and plentifull City placed on the bank of the River Loire. Some ancient Historiographers write,Aurelia. Vinum quod ex circumia∣cente agro colligitur ge∣nerosissimis Galliae ac∣censetur Sani∣tati tamen proficuum non creditur. Sic ut etiam Pincerne regio hoc Principi suo propinare vetitum prohibeatur. Jodoc. Sinc. Itinerar. Gal. that the foundation of this City was laid by Aurelian the Emperour, in the year 276. and from him was called Aure∣lia, which name unto this day it retaineth. Others say, it was onely enlarged by him. In this City was erected an University by Philip le Beau King of France, in the year from our Saviours Nativity 1312. wherein the Civil-Law is with such learning and admiration professed, that this Academy hath been often of grave and learn∣ed Writers, entituled the nurse or mother thereof. It enjoyeth the same priviledge with Tholouse. The Maidens here especially labour to adorn the French Tongue,They call it Pindarizer. and they strive so to excell in it with an emulation, that they boast that they imitate Pindar. Bourges. It is a City in France of great fame, rich, spacious, and much frequented. Some say, it was called Byturus quasi Bituris, from two ancient Towers, which they affirm to have been in this City erected by two brethren, which there together raigned. Tribus à binis inde vocor Bituris. In this City is a most glorious University, and so much admired of all learned Authors, that whensoever they have occasion to write thereof, they call it,Academiam habet celeber∣rimam, & cul vix ulla totius Galliae par. Erecta sub regno Ludo∣vici, cui Sancti nomen indi∣tam. Docue∣runt hic juris∣prudentiam Andraeus Alciatus, Eguinarius Baro, Petrus Rebussus, Franciscus Balduinus, Fr.

It was many years since found∣ed by a certain Duke of Burges, but after in continuance of time falling to decay, and being almost utterly extinct, it was again restored by sundry Kings of France. It was authorized and endued with many great priviledges and high prerogatives by Pope Paulus the 2d of that name. Here Alciate, Rebuffus, Duarenus, Hotoman, Bonellus and Cuiacius (famous Lawyers) lived and taught with great applause. Cane. An University was erected at Cane in Normandy, upon this occasion.Academia Cadomensis. Henry the 5th King of England, who subdued the Kingdom of France, and left the title to his posterity after many great and glorious Conquests atchieved against the French King, he at last bereaved him of Normandy, in the year 1418. In token and memory of which victory, as an eternal Trophy and Monument of his glory, he caused to be laid in Cane the foundation of this University. The Archbishop of Dublin was the first Reader of Divinity there. Here now lives Bochart the learned French Divine. Rhemes. It is a goodly City, and the Metropolis of Champaigne, wherein not long since was erected an University by the Prince Charles Guise, Cardinal of Lorain, Arch∣bishop and Duke of Rhemes, whose glory and renown daily more and more encrea∣seth, by reason of the Arts so learnedly there professed. S. Remigius was Bishop of this City, a man of holy conversation, and excel∣lently learned, as it evidently appeareth by the Commentaries which he wrote upon the Old and New Testament. He baptized Clodovaeus a mighty and puissant King of France, together with Chotisdis his wife, daughter to the King of Burgundy, he died in the year 498. The French Kings are anointed at Rhemes with the oyl wherewith St Re∣migius
had anointed Clodoveus the first Christian King of France. Burdeaux. It is the head City of Aquitane. In this City hath long flourished a most renowned University commonly called the School of Aquitaine,Gymnasium Aquitanicum per excellenti∣am vocatur, quòd in nulla alia Aquiraniae Academia omne artium genus publicè tradatur. Europaei orbis Academiae. where the Arts are publikely taught and professed. Here Ausonius that famous Poet was born and educated. Tholouse. Pope John the 22 was the first Institutor of the University therein, which as it was erected not long after Paris, so doth it enjoy the same priviledges that here∣tofore have been granted to Paris. There was said in times past to have been in this City a Temple, wherein were commonly reserved in secret vaults and dungeons under ground, as Possi∣donius saith, 15000 talents of gold, which if any man had taken, he shortly after came to some unfortunate end: From whence proceedeth the Proverb, applied commonly to those whose attempts are ever unfortunate and without success, Au∣rum babet Tolosanum. Nismes. It is called by Ptolomy, Pemponias Mela; Strabo and others, Nemausus; it is an ancient City in Dolphine, wherein was lately erected an University. Mompelliers. Mons Pessula∣nus.

Some think they pronounce the a too little, and the i too big and broad. Caius in his Book De pronuntiatione Graecae & Latinae linguae, saith, that he learned by experience that variety of pronuncing did hinder mutuall commerce, mens society and understanding of things. He saith, that a Greek Patriarck be∣ing at London in the Reign of Edward the 6th, did not understand Sir Thomas Cheeke, nor Sir Thomas him, the Knight using the new kinde of pronouncing, the other the old: he addes, pleading for the old and barbarous pronunciation, Quo omnes Graci ad huc utebantur cum ego essem Venetiis, tum è Cathedra Graecas literas profitendo, tum in templis sacra celebrando. Audiebam enim data opera saepius. At si ego tacerem norit Oxonionsis schola, quemadmodum ipsa Graecia pronunciarit, ex Matthaeo Calphurnio Graeco, quem ex Graecia Oxonium Graecarum literarum gratia produxerat Thomas Wolsaeus, de bonis literis optimè meritus Cardinalis, cum non alia ratione pronunciarit ille, quàm qua nos jam profitemur. Id si ita sit, nos Britanni do∣cebimus ipsos Graecos in ipsa Graecia oriundos sua verba sonare? suas voces atquè literas pronuntiare? & plus in aliena lingua sapiens quàm ipsa gens atquè natio, cui lingua Graeca familiaris atque etiam vulgaris est, & successione temporum continuata, tan∣quam per manus esse tradita? Nam privata haec pronunciatio paucorum hominum in Britania est, & eorum juvenum, alibi minimè recepta gentium. Westminster having but 40 Scholers, sends as many yearly to both the Vni∣versities, as Ea∣ton and Win∣chester both, though they have each of them 70 Scholers.

Elizabeth, and of Winchester, Schola certè Augusta, ante 200 ampliùs annos erecta, ut adolescentes suavioribus disciplinis imbuti, ad artes Academicas meliori ge∣nio animum intendant.

Lipsi Lovanium l. 3. c. 5. Most of their Universities (Paris excepted) being no better then our Colledges of Westminster, Eaton or Winchester. Oxford (without controversie) is the more healthfull place, and better situated, and the Town and streets (I suppose) larger.

Wake Mus. Regn.Both Universities are governed by a Vicechancellour and Proctors. The Heads of the Colledges in Oxford have severall Titles, as President, Ma∣ster, Warden, Provost, Dean, Principall; but in Cambridge they are all sty∣led Masters, except in Kings Colledge, the Head of that House is called the Provost.

Oxford Act concludes with a Latine Sermon, so doth not Cambridge. In our Universities Schollars live in their Colledges, not in the Town,Studiofi vitam fere monasti∣cam degunt, sicut enim in Monasteriis olim Monachi, nullis aliis rebus, erant intenti & occupati, quam ut statis horis, precibus ad Deum fusis, reliquum tempus bonis artibus, & studiis honestis impenderent, ita & hos facere oportet.

Those Schools of Learning which we call Academies or Universities, that Age termed Studia; that is, Studies. St Hierom termed the Schools of Gaul, Studia florentissima. The name of University was taken up about the time of King Henry the 3d, for a publick School. There are but three Latine Writers (which I have met with) who ve written generally de Academiis, Junius, and Middendorpe, and another intituled, Acade∣miarum quae aliquando Fuere & Hodie sunt in Europa, Catalogus & enumeratio brevis.

Coring. de Antiq. Acad. Dissertat. 3. there is added a brief Catalogue of all the Universities in the Christian world, in which their Country, Names, Originall and situation are described out of Ptolomy. He begins with England, and therein with Oxford, and saith of it, Academia Oxoni∣ensis vulgò Oxford, quam instituit Aluredus, Saxonum Rex, Anno Christi 872. Posteà vero ex multorum Principum & Praesulum beneficentia, amplissimis structuris, re∣ditibus & privilegiis ornatur: habtque jam Collegia XVI, aulas etiam VIII, sin∣gula
aedificiorum splendore magnificentissima, ac bonarum literarum artiumque omni∣um studia florentissima. Cantabrigiensis, vulgò Cambridge, in qua primum Colle∣gium instituit Batsomus, Eliensis Episcopus, Anno 1274. Habet jam Collegia XI, Aulas etiam IV, eaque omnia aedificiorum celebritate praestantissima. Habuit etiam ante Scholam publicam perangustam (in qua Philosophia, humanio oresque disciplinae tradebantur) à Sigeberto, Estanglorum Rege constitutam, Anno 637. Yet it is the opinion of some, that the University of Oxford was rather restored then first Founded by King Alured, Anno 806. after it had been over-born a while by Danish furies. Middendorp in his 3d Book de Academiis, where he speaks of the Universities of England, saith, Inter harum duarum Academiarum professores gravis & acerba nu∣per controversia exorta est, dum singuli suam Academiam & antiquiorem prioremque tempore, & praestantiorem existere asseverant, & varias pro sua quisque sententia rationes, diversaque argumenta producit, ut difficile sit homini externo, terra ab iis marique disjuncto, suum judicium interponere. But after counsell given to them, to endeavour rather to excell each the other in diligence,Quid profue∣rit si haec illa antiquior fu∣erit Academia, modo haec illi virtute par sit. Puerorum est de locorum praestantia & dignitate con∣tendere, & inanium verborum contentione & dissidio animos vulnerare. Caius de Antiquit. Cantab. Acad. l. 1. Dr Arrowsmiths modesty and ingenuity I approve of, who in a speech at Cambridge-Commencement the last save two, had this passage, Cantabrigia, Oxonium. Oxonium, Cantabrigia. faithfulness and wisdom, and not to stand so much upon antiquity, and multitude, or excellency of Col∣ledges, which belong more to the glory of the dead then the living, he concludes at the last thus, Porrò utramque hanc Academiam, veterem quidem atque florentem reperio, Can∣tabrigiensis tamen, quantum hactenus deprehendere licuit, tempore prior & antiquior est. Ideoque ab ea principium ducam. But Learned Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus p. 217. saith thus, Haec ipsa Antiquitatis lis, publico jam nuper totius Regni conventu Parliamen∣tario, ex antiquissimorum Historicorum fide examinata est & determinata, & prae∣cedentia Oxoniensi Vniversitati communi applausu omniumque suffragiis asserta. There he also addeth, p. 218. Johannes Caius, vir fidei ut in rebus Religiosis, ita in Historicis nullius plane. He proceeds, Imò qui inter ipses istius Scholae antiquitatem acerrimè tuentur, non asserunt tan∣tùm, sed & probant indubitatis argumentis Cantabrigiam, Generalem Artium & scientiarum Academiam factam & stabilitam non fuisse, ante vicesimum annum Edwardi tertii (hoc est nudiustertius ferè, si Aluredi seculum spectemus) quo Rege intercedente, apud Johannem Pontificem Romanum, Universitatis ibi stabiliendae privilegium iis est concessum ut Petrus de Ickham Monachus Ecclesiae Cantuar. scribit. Caius Mddendorpii testimonio rem probat: Caii testimonio eandem probat Midden∣dorpius: sic manus manum, & falsarius falsarium fricat. Quin potiùs suam opor∣tet agnoscere ignorantiam, qui de exterorum rebus scribit, quorum res gestas nunquam legerit. Imò Middendorpi (tibi clam in aurem dico) agnosce impudentiam tuam, qui ita confidenter scribis de Academiis, ac si in omnibus aetatem totam vixisses, ita tamen frigidè, futiliter, indoctè, ac si in nulla unquam vel diem unum posuisses. Wake ibid. The third who writes of all the Academies of Europe saith, Ac libens optarim ne digladientur nimis & naenias mittant, qui hanc aut illam Acadmia contendunt esse antiquioram. Sint Arcades ambae, utraeque florentes, lu∣cem sole clariorem sibi invicem alternantes. There is a Ma∣nuscript of Ro¦bert Burhils in Oxford Library, De Britanniae rebus Scholasticis in verse, consisting of ten Books. The sixth book is termed Elfreda, de urbe Oxonia quam Elfreda insedem Academiae deligendam suader. The seventh book is styled Parallelismus de Antiqui∣tate utriusque Academiae Oxon. & Cantab. wherein he asserte the antiquity of Oxford, but saith, Non est quod Can∣tabrigiensis Academia hanc suam originem etsi seriorem erubesceret. Primo, cum nec operae pretium sit contendere. Secundo, nec leves interim calamitates dum nondum exorta esset Cantabrigia, Academiam Oxoniensem nostram exceperint. Tertio, & antiquiora ferè incultiora, Academiis vix tandem Monastica fece expurgatis.And after he hath this passage of Cambridge: Haec est illa Academia antiqua, & celebris, quae non modò Oxoniensi florentissimo Anglorum Gymnasio, sed & aliis Eu∣ropaei
orbis Academiis antiquioribus facilè posset adaequari. He speaks also very honourably of Oxford, and I have cited something out of him to that purpose. Sir Thomas More saith in an Epistle to the University of Oxford, Cantabrigiae, cui vos praelucere semper consuevistis.Epistola Tho∣mae Mori ad Acad. Oxon. I know one, who is a very competent judge, because a most Learned Bishop, and well versed in antiquities, and also of an University in another Kingdom, who holds Oxford to be the ancienter. Oxford also hath been famous for Learned Scholars. Mathematicians and Schoolmen, for the later there is no question,Trithemius, Baleus, Le∣landus Oxo∣nienses ultra trecentos Cantabrigi∣enses non plures uno supra centum & viginti scriptores in suis Catalogis commemorant. Brianus Twinus Antiq. Acad. Oxon. and I shall mention divers of them when I speak of Merton Colledge. For the first Roger Bacon, Bradwardine, Simon Bredon and Oddington were famous. The first Professor Vide Gervas. Dorobernens. in Civil Law in England, viz. Vacarius, was of Oxford. Oxford lies in a Champion plain: It is a fair and goodly City, whether a man respect the seemly beauty of private houses, or the stately magnificence of publick buildings, together with the wholesom sight or pleasant prospect thereof. It is formed in the figure of a Cross, two long streets thwarting one another, each of them near a mile in length, containing in that compass thirteen Parish Churches, and a See Episcopall founded here by King Henry the 8th, Anno 1541. For the Stateliness of the Schools and publick Library and There are many Pictures throughout the great Gallery adjoyning to the Library, of Learned men in severall Faculties. The Statutes of the University of Oxford at large are much commended. The select Statutes out of the body of them are printed and to be sold. Gallery, the bra∣very and beauty of particular Colledges, all built of fair and polished stone, the liberall endowment of those houses, and great incouragements of Industry and Learning in the salary of the Professors in most Arts and Sciences, it is (say some) not to be paralleled in the Christian world. Dr James hath set out two Catalogues of the publick Library in Oxford: One published in the year 1605. which mentions the Books Alphabetically di∣stinguished, according to the four Faculties.Clarissimus vir Thomas Bodleius qui vetustate, & temporum an hominum in∣juria Collap∣sam Univer∣sitatis Biblio∣thecam im∣mensis sum∣ptibus, conquisitis undine praeter omnes omnium generum codices excusos, manuscriptis, quantum in hoc spici∣legio licuit, compluribus vetustis optimae notae, instauravit. Savil. Not. in Chrysost. in Gen. Tom. 8. The other 1620. in which there is only a care had of the Alphabeticall order, by this more exact Catalogue one may readily finde any Authour, and all the Works of that Authour uno intuitu. If the Library be inferiour to the Popes Vaticane in sumptuous building, yet in Printed Books, if not in Manuscripts (there being many choice ones given by Sir Thomas Bodlie, and of late by my Lord of Pembroke, and Archbishop Laude, in almost all Languages) it may well contend with it for a Superiority. Reckon the number of Volumes in the publick Library,He mentions sixteen thousand in his Preface to his last Cata∣logue. whereof the greatest part are in Folio, which amount to 11 or 12 thousands of divers Authours, the plurality of Languages, the diversity of Sciences, wherein these Books are writ∣ten, the condition of the Books whether written or printed, by Protestants or Pa∣pists, or any other, the use for six hours every day throughout the whole year, (Sundaies and Holydaies excepted) and we shall finde that the like Library is no where to be found. Dr James of the Corrupt. of Script. Counc. and Fath. part 5. In Oxford there are 18 Colledges endowed with Lands, besides 7 Halls, where Students live at their own charges in both of them. Professors of the Arts and Sciences, as also of Divinity, Law, Physick, and the learned Languages, with Liberall Salaries.
Vniversity Colledge, Founded 872. Alfred or Allured King of the West Saxons, being addicted to Religion and good literature, for the increase and study of Divinity, Philosophy and other Arts, in the 2d year of his reign founded this Colledge, by the name of Vniversity Colledge. George Abbat Archbishop of Canterbury was of this Colledge. Baliol Colledge, Founded 1262. John Baliol, born at Bernads Castle in the Bishoprick of Durham, (a worthy Warriour to King Henry the 3d in his civil Warres against his Barons) with his wife Dervorgilla,Collegium Baliolense gloriatur po∣tiùs quòd Humfredum ducem Gloce∣striae, Henrici quarti filium virtutum me∣rito Bonum cognomina∣tum Acade∣miae nostrae lucidum atque patriae Sydus, nomen que nunquam oblinescendum educarit quàm quòd Cranmerum Archiepiscopum, Ridlaeum, Latimerum Episcopos, suis prae foribus (ut Elium) igneis vehiculis coelum petentes conspexerit. Wake Rex Platon. a Lady of Honourable Parentage, Parents of John Baliol King of the Scots, Founded this Colledge, giving thereunto both Lands and Revenews, for the maintenance of a Master, 10 Fellows, and 11 Scholars, which is Recorded to be the first and most anciently endowed Colledge in this University, as some late Historians constantly affirm. Jam Fundatoris imprimis Balioli Regis Scotiae nomen jactat, quasi tum olim Scotia suos Reges Academiae nostrae propitios in Baliolo suo sposponderit, quod in Jacobo nostro jam faeliciter appropinquante praestitit. Wake Rex Plat. John Wiclefe was of this House. Wiclefus ille Restaurator Religionis cui non notus Baliolensis. Alber. Gent. Laud. Acad. Perusin. & Oxon. Merton Colledge Founded 1274. Walter de Merton sometimes L.

It may be styled Collegium Scholasticorum, Bacon, Burlie, Occham, Scotus, Brad∣wardine, Gatisdene, Dumbleton, Nicholas Gorrham, Suitzaens, great lights of Europe were of this Colledge. What one Colledge ever yielded at one time and from one Country, three such Divines as Jewell, Raynolds, and Hooker; or two such great Wits and Heroicall spirits, as Sr Thomas Bodley, and Sr Henry Savill, Dr Hackw. Epist. Dedicat. to Oxford before his Apology. Of this Colledge also were Bishop Carleton, Sr Isaac Wake the University Orator. Excester Colledge, Founded 1316. Walter Stapleton, being descended of Noble Parentage (for his Wisdom, Gra∣vity and Learning, was often employed in Embassages from King Edward the 2d, who made him Bishop of Excester, Lord Treasurer of England, and one of his Privy Councell) Founded this Colledge, it was much augmented by Sir William Peter. Dr Hakewell Fellow of this House, erected and finished the new Chappell. Dr Prideaux was Head of this House. Hollandus al∣ter Apollo, po∣tens in Scripturis, cum patribus adeo familiaris ac si ipse Pater, cum Scholasticis ac si seraphicus Doctor. Conc. Funeb.Dr Holland was of this House.
Orial Colledge, Founded 1337.There are many guesses at the original of its name. King Edward the 2d erected it, it was so called because it was indeed a work which might beseem a King. Queens Colledge, Founded 1340. Robert Eglesfield Batchelor of Divinity, Chaplain to Queen Philippa, wife to King Edward the 3d,Collegium Reginae nobi∣litatur duorum Principum, omnium, quos Anglia vidit, fortissimorum educatione; videlicet Ed∣wardi Principis cognomento Nigri & Henrici Quinti felicissimi Regis.

Jodoc. Sinc. Itinerar.

They are called to Dinner and Supper by the sound of a Trumpet. Doctor Ayrie (who wrote so well upon the Philippians) was Provost of this Colledge. Learned D. Langbane is now the Provost of it, and worthy M. Barlow the Publick-Library-Keeper, a Fellow of it. New Colledge, Founded 1375. William Wickam principal Secretary to King Edward the 3d, Keeper of the Pri∣vy-Seal, Bishop of Winchester, Lord High-Treasurer,Collegium Beatae Mariae, quod vulgò novum (etsi revera per an∣tiquum) dici∣tur. Wake. Rex Platon.Hoc ipso item anno (viz. 1366.) Guli∣elmus Unyck∣am Vintoni∣ensis Episco∣pus Oxonii in rei litterariae gratiam Collegium excitavit, illudque D. Mariae Virgini dicavit, quod hodie novum Collegium nuncupatur. Georg. Lilii Anglorum Reg. Chronicon. and Chancellour of Eng∣land, founded this Colledge. He also founded a Colledge at Winchester, wherein he established one Warden, ten Fellows, two Schoolmasters and seventy Scholars, with Officers and servants, which all are maintained at his charge; out of which School he ordained should be chosen the best Scholars alwayes to supply the vacant places of the Fellows of this Colledge. Thomas Chaundlerus librum de Wiccami vita & rebus gestis sane perelegantem conscripsit Waynfleti . Wickamus celebratur ab erudito Jurisconsulto Martino. Of this Colledge was Philpot the famous Martyr, and Sr Thomas Rives, Bishop Lake, Dr Twisse and Dr James. Lincoln Colledge, Founded 1420. Richard Fleming Bishop of Lincoln in the eighth year of the reign of King Henry the 5th founded this Colledge by the name of Lincoln Colledge, which was afterward in Richard the thirds time, in the year of our Lord 1479. by Thomas Rotheram Bishop of the same Sea, and Secretary to four Kings, much augmented and increased. Dr Kilbie a learned Hebrician was Head of this Colledge, and that learned School-Divine Dr Sanderson was Fellow of this House. All-Souls Colledge, 1437. Henry Chichley Archbishop of Canterbury,Linacer was Fellow of this Colledge, and Sir Thomas More his Scholar. Si politam operis elegantiam requiramus, est propter structuram Collegium omnium Animarum ex lapide quadrato & perpolito in prima orbis facie multùm spectabile. Eurpoaei orbis Academiae. layed in Oxford the foundation of two goodly Colledges, this and that of St Johns Colledge, the last being reedified by St Thomas White Lord Maior of London. There is Vita Henrici Chichele Descripta ab Arthuro Duck.
Magdalen Colledge, Founded 1459. William Wainflet Bishop of Winchester founded first Magdalen-Hall, after that this Colledge dedicating the same to the honour of S. Mary Magdalen.Itaque longè magnificentius hospitium excipiendis Musis condi∣turus (regia quippe benig∣nitate adjutus) Aulam Magdalenae quamvis patentem Collegii dereliquit, domumque consanguinem ne omnino periisse videretur, in suum quasi corpus iterum transtulit.

Wake Rex Platon.Richard Fox Bishop of Winchester, and Godfather to King Henry the 8th found∣ed this Colledge. It nourished Jewel, Rainolds, Wtton, Hooker, Cardinal Pool, who was chosen Pope, Dr Featley, and other learned men. Christ-Church Colledge, Founded 1546. Est Regia Musarum se∣des, sive operis molem mirandam, sive structurae magnificentiam, five studiosorum numerum, five proventus annuos pleniùs inspiciamus, si alicubi in orbe Christiano, Christo Servatori dicata: à Thoma Volsaeo Cardinale, anno post Christum 1539. Quem fundo largo, praediis amplis, & reditibus multis illustrissimus Rex Henricus Octavus, anno Christi 1546. auctiorem reddidit, & longe consummatiorem Europaei Orbis Academiae.Thomas Wolsey Cardinal, Archbishop of York, and Lord high Chancellour of
England laid the foundation of a most ample and spacious Colledge, but he falling, his design failed with the Founder. Henry the eight enriched the same with many goodly revenues, annexing there∣unto Canterbury Colledge. It hath a spatious Court or quadrangle, nay divers, and a Hall both spatious and splendid, wherein is a most beautifull glasse Lanthorn, there is also a very fair Kitchin, which only, was finished by the Cardinal, and gave occasion to that scoff of an outlandish man, Egregium opus (saith he) Cardinalis Collegium incepit, po∣pinam absolvit. Sanna vix è coquina deprompta adeo sale caret, saith Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus. Peter Martyr was once Prebend of this Colledge, as his own Epistles shew, He writes thus, Amico cuidam in Anglia, Ego cum essem Oxonii vestibus illis albis in Choro nunquam uti volui, quamvis essem Canonicus, mei facti ratio mihi con∣stabat. Toby Matthew Archbishop of York was of this House, and Mr Burton who wrote of Melancholy, upon whose Tomb there is this witty Epitaph, Paucis nocus, paucioribus ignotus Hic jacet Democritus Iunior Cui vitam pariter & mortem Dedit Melancholia. Trinity Colledge, Founded 1556. Sir Thomas Pope Knight founded this Colledge in the fourth year of the Reign of King Philip and Qu. Mary, dedicating the same to the Trinity. St Johns Colledge, Founded 1557. Henry Chichley Doctor of the Civil-Law Archbishop of Canterbury, among other building, laid the foundation of this Fabrick; it was enlarged by William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury. Jesus Colledge, Founded 1572. Hugh Prise Doctor of the Civil-Law founded this Colledge, it was perfected by Queen Elizabeth; it hath had many other Benefactors. Wadham Colledge, Founded 1613. Nicholas Wadham Esquire in the seventh year of the raign of King James found∣ed it. Pembrok Colledge, Founded 1620. It was first Broadgate-Hall, but was called Pembroke Colledge from William Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and Visitor of that Hall. There are also in this University seven Hals, in which there are many Students living at their own charge, viz. Glocester-Hall. Which being first built for Monks, was after converted to a House for Scholars, by Sir Thomas White Knight. Edmund Hall. It was builded by S. Edmund Archbishop of Canterbury. Albon Hall. It was builded by the Abbot of St Albons, for their Monks to study in. Hart Hall. It was built by Walter Stapleton Bishop of Excester.
Mr Selden was of this House. New Inne. Heretofore it was called Turlocks Inne. St Mary Hall. It was founded by King Edward the second. Sir Thomas More Chancellour of England was of this Hall. Cardinal Allen was principal of it about the same time. Magdalen Hall. It was founded by William Wainfleet Bishop of Winchester, and Dr Budden who writes his life and death, cals it Aulam Magdalene parentem Collegii, and a little book which mentions the several Colledges in Oxford and Cambridge, makes the Hall a eleven years elder then the Colledge. Cambridge. THis is the other University and eye of England, a most famous Storehouse of good Literature and Godlinesse; it standeth upon the River Cam, which di∣videth it into two parts, and hath a Bridge over it, whence arose the name Cam∣bridge. There is not wanting any thing here, which a man may require in a most flou∣rishing University, were it not that the air is somewhat unhealthfull, arising as it doth out of a Fenny-ground hard by. Imò qui inter ipsos istius Scholae anti∣quitatem acer∣rimè tuentur, non asserunt tantùm, sed & probant indu∣bitatis argu∣mentis Canta∣brigiam, Gene∣ralem Artium & Scientiarum Academiam factam & stabilitam non fuisse, ante Vicesimum annum Edwardi tertii, hoc est nudius-tertius ferè, si Aluredi seculum spectemus. Wake Rex. Platon. Vide plura ibid.That Cantaber a Spaniard 3751. years before Christs Nativity, first began and founded this University, is affirmed by Cains, but Leland the great Antiquary, and Camden also confute that conceit; and Mr Camden saith, It was a seat of lear∣ning about the time of King of Henry the first, and that under the reign of Edward the first (some think it should be the second) Grantbridge of a School was made an Vniversity (such as Oxford is) by the Court of Rome. Hugh Balsham Bishop of Ely in the year 1284. built the first Colledge, called Peter House, and endowed it with lands: whose example the other Founders did imitate and follow, saith the same Camden. That which some relate also, That a publick Academy was erected at Cambridge by King Sigebert, Anno Christi 630. Id vero dubia annalium fide nititur; Canta∣brigiensium quoque aemuli Oxonienses pernegant fortiter. Et ut quaedam fuerit insti∣tuta, procul dubio rudis fuit, nec in longum tempus.

Acad. l. 1.That which some urge for the honour of Cambridge of Bedes reading there, is a fable well confuted by Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus, in his Acts of the fourth day, Bedam vero ipsum unquam Cantabrigiae fuisse quis nisi cerebri lasi putat? Quum ipse dissertissimis scriptis suis assorat, se nunquam extra monasterium suum operam literis dedisse, ac ne inde unquam ferè egressum à pueritia; Cantabrigiam ve∣rò, sua aetate adeò Academiam celebrem non fuisse, ut fuisse, ut planè desolatam civitatulam asserat. Caius the Physician styled himself Londinensem when he wrote De Antiq. Cantab. Acad. though he was of Cambridge, and only a Londoner by birth, ne si Canta∣brigiensis
videretur, affectum quoque suum in scribendo prodidisse videretur, That passage of Caius's De Antiqu. Cantab. Acad. lib. 1. therefore might well have been spared.

My worthy friend Sir Simonds D' Ewers (in his Speech touching the Antiquity of Cambridge) saith, If I should lose time to reckon up the vain allegations pro∣duced for the Antiquity of Oxford by Twyne, and of Cambridge by Caius, I should but repeat deliria senum. At the present Cambridge consists of sixteen Colledges and Hals (for there is little difference there between them) erected and maintained with the Lands and Reve∣nues of their several Founders.The Halls there are endowed with Lands and Fellowships as the Colleges are. No private Chappel in England beyond that of Kings Colledge in Cambridge. Collegium studiosorum propè dixerim Europae amplissimum Vos. Epist. Dedicat. ad artem Grammatic.

Kings Colledge Chappel being founded by Henry the sixth, is all of free-stone, a very curious structure, and from its form, called the University Cradle. Trinity Colledge founded by King Henry the eighth, one of the compleatest Colledges in Europe. A Colledge for stately greatnesse, for uniform building and beauty of rooms, scarce inferiour to any other in Christendom, saith Camden. Next to it is St Johns Colledge.

Dr Butler the famous Physician was sometimes Fellow and President of this House. Pembroke Hall, Founded 1343. Mary de S. Paul Countesse of Pembroke, daughter to Guido Chastillion Earl of St Paul in France, procured Licence from King Edward the 3d, to found this House by the name of the Colledge of Mary Valence, after called Pembroke Hall.

Mr Bradford Martyr was Fellow of Pembroke Hall, and first lived in Katherine
Hall, and the Masters of those Colledges strove which should have him, as himself relates in one of his Letters, not to boast of himself, but to shew Gods goodness towards him. Acts and Mon. Edit. ult. part. 3 p. 508.Bishop Ridley was also of Pembroke Hall, and there in the Orchard learned without Book almost all Pauls Epistles, yea and all the Canonical Epistles, save only the Apocalypse.

King James being in Caius Colledge presented with Caius his Antiquitates Cantabrigiensis Acadmiae, he said, What should I do with the Antiquities of Cam∣bridge? Give me Caius That Book of his is commend∣ed. de Canibus. Kings Colledge, Founded 1441. King Henry the sixth in the nineteenth year of his Reign, began this royal Foun∣dation. See Stows Chrònicle in the life of Henry the sixth.In which Colledge at this present is standing one of the fairest Chappels in the world, which only he finished, but intended to have made the Colledge conform∣able thereunto. D Goade was of this House. Queens Colledge, Founded 1448. Queen Margaret wife to Henry the sixth laid the Foundation of this Colledge, but leaving the same imperfect, Queen Elizabeth wife to King Edward the fourth, obtained Licence to finish the same, which she accomplished.

It is the chief Town of Fife, an Archiepiscopal See, and an University, erected in the year after our Saviours Incarnation, 1411. The Vniversity of Ireland. THe Christian Faith was first preached among the Irish by St Patrick. The Irish Scholars of Patrick profited so notably in Christianity, that in the Age next following, Ireland was termed Sanctorum Patria, that is, the native Countrey of Saints; and the Scottish Monks in Ireland and Britain highly excelled for their holinesse and learning. Out of Ireland came Caelius Sedulius a Priest. Richard Fitz-Ralf, commonly called Armachanus, is of famous memory, who turned the edge of his style about the year 1355. against the mendicant Friers, as detesting in Christians such voluntary begging. Dublin, or Divelin. Dublinium & Dublinia. The Irish call it Balacleigh, the Town upon Hurdles, when it was built, the foundation was laid upon Hur∣dles, the place was so feuish and moorish. This is the chief City of Ireland, it is situated in a delightfull and wholsome place.There is a beautifull Colledge consecrated unto the name of the holy and indivi∣sible Trinity, which for the exercising and polishing of wits with good Literature, Queen Elizabeth endowed with the Priviledges of an University; and it is furnish∣ed with a good Library. Bishop Vsher was born there, and was the first Scholar of that Colledge. Thus much of Dublin (saith Camden in his Britaine) for the most part of which I acknowledge my self beholden unto the diligence and learning of James Vsher Chancellor of St Patricks Church, whose variety of knowledge and judge∣ment are far above his years.

He was a Learned man and Schoolmaster to Charles the 5th, who sent him to Rome to negotiate for him for the Popedom, thinking thereby to sway much if he could get both the Swords; but they chose Adrian, who would not change his name (as the custom is) when he was made Pope. Marcellus Cervinus being elected Pope also retained his name, shewing that his dignity had not changed him. See the Hist. of the Counell of Trent, l. 5. p. 389, 390. He saith there, that the changing of the Popes names began, because Dutch men were made Popes, to whose names Roman ears were not accustomed, all that fol∣lowed observed the same use, signifying thereby that they had changed their pri∣vate affections into publick and divine cares. Platina saith Sergius the 2d was first called Os Prci, Swines mouth, and because of that filthy name he took the Name of Sergius when he was made Pope, and that that custom continued after, that those which were made Popes changed their names, although this was not observed by them all. Adrians memorable speech was, Nihil sibi imperio infelicius in vita accidisse, That nothing befell him more unhappy in his life, then his Dominion. He was severe and purposed to reform corruptions, and said he would begin with the Court, but was thereupon poysoned, as some think. Vide Sleid. Comment. lib. 3.

Aeneas Sylvius an Italian, after called Pope Pius the 2d, he lived in the year 1464. Being seven years old sporting with his playfellows of the same age, he was sa∣luted Pope by them, all of them kissing his feet, as the Papists do the Popes. Historians report the like of Ambrose, how he was made a Bishop being a boy by his companions. He was very Learned, an excellent Orator, a great Poet, Philosopher and Cos∣mographer, he could speak eloquently.

Aeschines the Orator, he was an Athenian, there was a great contest between him and Demosthenes,Lecte sunt Orationes Aeschinis: qua∣rum tres nu∣mero sunt, & Epistolae novem. Nam Deliaca non est Aeschinis. In orationibus suavis, purus, distinctus, & Enthymemarum perspicuitate excellens. Phetii Biblioth. p. 1463. Demosthenes caused him to be banished.

He left many Scholars and two principall ones among the rest, Thomas de Aquino, and Bonaventure. He died when he was fourscore years old. He left many Books which are now Printed, and do much elucidate Philosophy and Divinity. Although he was as it were the chief of the Schoolmen, yet he hath some things not agreeable to the Doctrine of the Papists. Illyr. Catal. I est. verit. l. 16.

Leand. Alb. Descript∣tor. Ital. Albertus, he was a Learned man of the same family. Gabriel Albaspinaeus Bishop of Orleance. He published a Book de Eucharistiae Mysterio, and two Books De veteribus Ec∣clesiae ritibus cum notis in Concilium Eliberitanum, & aliquot Tertulliani libros. Mr Selden and Mr Gillespie cite his observations on Tertullian, and speak of him as a great Antiquary. This was his Epitaph, Clauditur hoc tumulo spinâ cui nomen ab Albâ Successor patriae fidei, successor honoris, Regis deliciae, procerumque & plebis amores: Dives opum bene partarum, sed ditior usu; Munificus, facilisque aditu, studiisque politus Ingenuis, rectique tenax, & simplice lingua Egregium decus oris erat; maturius annis Consilium, & cani juvenili in corpore mores.

His Emblems are much commended by Julius Scaliger.Alciati praeter emblemata nihil mihi videre contigit. Ea verò talia sunt ut cum quovis ingenio certare possint. Dulcia sunt, pura sunt, elegantia sunt: sed non sine nervis: sententiae verò tales, ut etiam ad usus civilis vitae conferant. Scalig. Hypercritic. cap. 3. Arias Montanus made these verses of him, Eloquio jus Romanum lucebat & arte, Turba obscurarunt barbara legulei. Andreas prisco reddit sua jura nitori, Consultos{que} facit doctius inde loqui. Our age (saith Learned Pasquier Recherch. de la France, l. 9. ch. 30) brought forth four great persons in the same time, Erasmus a Dutchman, Budeus a French∣man, Alciate an Italian, Vives a Spaniard: and yet we have with us (saith he) Adrian Turnebus and Peter Ramus, which last hath made many Books full of learning and knowledge; and for Turnebus his Adversaria consisting in Huma∣nity, it is a work unimitable in variety of knowledge. In his 29. ch. of that Book he speaks of the Lawyers in the year 1500 which joyned the study of the Law with humane learning, where he makes honourable mention of also Budeus, Alciate, Cu∣jacius, and divers others. Stephanus Paschasius likewise in his Icones, hath these verses of Erasmus, Budaus and Alciate. Qui leget hos, leget ille sui tria lumina secli, Lumina non ullo non colebranda die.

He hindred Theodosius the Emperour from entring into the Church, for a mur∣ther committed at Thessalonica. To whom when the Emperour said, That David the King was also an adulterer and manslayer, Ambrose answered, Qui secutus es errantem, sequere poenitentem, Thou that hast followed him sinning, follow him repenting. Hence the Emperour underwent a publick penance imposed upon him by the Bishop. He stoutly defending the Catholick Faith and Ecclesiasti∣cal Discipline, converted many Arians, and other hereticks to the truth of the Faith. It is reported of him, that when he was an Infant, a swarm of Bees setled on his face, as he lay in his Cradle, and flew away without hurting of him, where∣upon his Father said, If this childe live, he will be some great man. He flourished anno Christi 361. Helv. Chron. Cardinal Baronius at the commandment of Pope Sixtus, wrote St Ambrose his life with all diligence. Before he was Bishop, he was a secular Judge, and no Di∣vine: nay, no Christian at all; but his Christianity and Divinity began both toge∣ther, after he was chosen Bishop of Milane. For, he was fain to be Christened, before he could be consecrated. Bish. Andrews Answ. to the 20th Ch. of Cardinal Perrons Reply.

He was a worthy and valiant Champion of Christ, and adversary of Antichrist. He wrote against the Friers and their hypocrisie, but especially against the begging Friers. In his dayes there was a most detestable and blasphemous book set forth by the Friers, which they called Evangelium aeternum, or, Evangelium Spiritus Sancti, The Everlasting Gospel, or, The Gospel of the holy Ghost; it said, The Gospel of Christ was not to be compared with that Gospel, no more then darknesse to light. That the Gospel of Christ should be preached but fifty years, and then this Everlasting Gospel should rule the Church. He mightily impugned this pestiferous Book. Foxes Act. and Monum.

For his witty inventions, forecastings, policies, disputations and other labori∣ous affairs about the overthrow of princely Authority, and uprearing of Anti∣christs tyranny, Pope Vrbanus appointed both him and them that should after∣ward succeed in the Patriarchal seat of Canterbury to fit at his right foot in every general Councel,Bales English Volares. p. 4. and that he also ratified by a special decree.

For his profound Learning and great piety, he is commonly called in the Popish School Divus Thomas, because he was canonized by Pope John the 22. Doctor Angelicus ob acumen ingenii. He was a great maintainer of the Authority of the Bishops of Rome. Upon whose Scholastical Works by Popish Divines, are published as many Commentaries, as upon the holy Scripture, and his Summes are more frequently read in their Schools and Academies, then the Bible it self; yet he when he was near his end, taking the Bible, is said to have uttered this speech, Credo quicquid in hoc libro scriptum est, I believe whatsoever is written in this book. It is said, he got his knowledge rather by prayer then labour and industry, therefore he would still pray before he did write, reade or dispute. He was so intent upon his studies, that supping at Court with Lewis the French King, whilst others were discoursing of pleasant matters, he was so deep in his Meditation, that forgetting himself, he strook the Table with his hand, saying, Jam conclusum est contra Manichaeos, Now it is concluded against the Ma∣nichees. Stephanus Paschasius in his Icones, hath these verses of Thomas Aquinas. Cedite Pythagorae qui dogmata vana putatis; Redditus in terris alter Aristoteles.

God would have some singular, Idea, as it were, to be in all Arts, which all that are studious of that Art should propound to themselves to imitate, as De∣mosthenes and Tully in eloquence, Hippocrates and Galen in Physick, Archimedes in the Mathematicks. He had an admirable Genius or wit for the Mathe∣maticks, and by study he perfected it. He did so bend his thoughts that way, that he almost neglected other necessaries. If he were at any time led
to the Bath by his servants, he would make figures in the ashes, and upon his anoin∣ted body.Ram. Schol. Mathem. l. 1.

Geneb. Chron. l. 3. He was the wonder of all the world for his learning, piety and constancy, stand∣ing like an unshaken Rock against the Sea of Arian Errors. He was called Haereticorum Mallens, and was one of the chiefest in the Councel of Nice. He foretold the destruction of Julian the Emperour, when by his Edict he was cast out of Alexandria, he said to his hearers bewailing his exile, Bono animo estote filioli nubecula est, brevi evanescet, Be of good courage my children, it is but a little Cloud, and will soon vanish away. He lived (say some) six years in a Well without the light of the Sun, forsaken of friends, and every where hunted by enemies.

He defended the truth against whatsoever errour prevailed in his age: His Book de Doctrina Christiana is a good Body of Divinity. His Books de Civitate Dei are full of humane learning. Some most dislike, amongst Augustines interpretation of Scripture, his Exposi∣tion on the Psalms, though it be full of excellent matter.

He was very skilfull in Greek and Latine; he wrote many things in Prose and Verse. His saying was Beatum esse non qui habet quae cupit, sed qui non cupit, quae non habet. He is blessed not which hath the things which he desires, but who doth not desire the things which he hath not. Therefore the Aquitanes did boast of him, Quemadmodum Ausonius neminem sibi proposuit imitandum: ita Ausonium nemo nunc potest imitari.

Pasquier Recherches de la France, l. 7. c. 11. shews that the French Poets imita∣ting the Latine, have often equalled, and sometimes exceeded them. He instan∣ceth in the description of the old Chaos by Ovid, and compares with it that of Du Bartas, and in some verses of Virgils and Rousards: Although (saith he) some would blame du Bartas his style as too swelling, yet his work hath been very well liked, not only for the worthy subject which he praiseth, but also for his learning, fine Discourses, pithy strains, and proper deductions which accom∣pany it. Antoine du Verdier in his Bibliotheque much commends him.

His Hexameron is very much esteemed, followed so much by Ambrose. He was honoured by the Ancients with this Elogium .

Brit. Antiquitates.BEda was an English man, born not farre from Dyrrham: He was the Learnedest man of his time, skillfull in Divine and Secular Learning. Of his rare learning and knowledge his Writings yet extant are a clear and sufficient testimony. He was so great a follower of St Augustine (the worthiest Pillar of the Church since the Apostles time, as some hold) that his Commentaries upon the Scripture, both of Old and New Testament, are almost word for word out of St Augustine. He was a continuall Preacher, as his Homilies do testifie. He was usually called Venerable Bede, but why, the Monks usque ad ineptias cer∣tant, as Lilius Gyraldus saith, De Poet. Hist. Dial. 5. Some of the reasons given for that title are ridiculous. One saith, Pietate & eruditione venerabilis cognomen adeptus est. He was called Venerable for his Piety and Learning. Others say he was called Venerable, because that was the title of Presbyter, and his Homilies were read in his life time, and they calling him then not Saint but Venerable, so called him after his death. Vide Trithem. de Script. Eccles. Sedulius is likewise styled Venerabilis. Beda's Works were printed in three Tomes at Paris, An. 1545. and in eight Tomes at Basil, Anno Domini 1563. in Folio, containing four great Vo∣lumes. In omni disciplinarum genere, Graecae etiam atque Latinae linguae gnarus excelluit: Poeta, licet mediocris, Rhetor, Historicus, Astronomus, Arithmeticus, Cosmogra∣phus, Philosophus, Theologus, ita eo tempore mirabilis, ut in proverbium apud ejus seculi doctores abierît, Hominem in extremo orbis angulo natum, universum orbem suo ingenio perstrinxisse.

Possevine in his Biblioth. Select. tomo 1o l. 7. c. 4. saith of his four Tomes of Con∣troversies, Opus absolutissimum, quòd Controversiarum fermè omnium corpus dici queat. Gretser in his Preface to his Defence of Bellarmines Controversies also highly magnifies him. Cardinall D' Ossat in his fifth book of French Letters saith thus of him, Est celuy qui a faict et oeuure incomparable des Controverses pour la Religion Catholique, contre toutes les heresies qui sont auiourd' huyr & qui ont estè au temps passè; & nostre sainct Pere le faisant Cardinal a voulu honorer tant la vertu, & doctrine, & labeur de ce personnage, que le College des Cardinaux.

He was a Venetian, and a Cardinall: his Life is written by Johannes Casa. His style is disliked by Lipsius and others. It is no marvell if Lipsius disliked his style, it being nothing like his own, but he was a great Ciceronian, as also was Sadoletus the Cardinall his great friend, and above them both, he who was familiar with them both, Longolius. Peter Bembus is reported to have said (witnesse George Fabricius and Alexander of Hales in his Commentary upon the 2d of Tim.) Semel legi Biblia.

Num ergo Papista fuerat, qui contra Jesuitas, contra Tridentinos, in maximis fidei articulis Ecclesiam Catholicam & Patrum consensum sequitur? Dicam apertè quod res est. Bernardus Romani Pontificis jurisdictionem longe supra omnes superiores Patres extulit. Atque hinc est, quod Papista vocetur à Bellarmino. Nam Cyprianus, Augustinus, Ambrosius, aliique superiores Ro∣mani Pontificis jurisdictionem cohibuerunt. Bernardus autem incidit in fatalia illa tempora, ultra annum mille∣simum, Satana jam soluto.

He joyned with Rabanus in refuting the errour of the carnall presence, at the first bringing in thereof by Paschasius Rabertus. The book which he wrote de Cor∣pore & Sanguine Christi to Carolus Calvus the Emperour, was forbidden to be read, by order from the Roman Inquisition, confirmed afterward by the Coun∣cell of Trent. The Divines of Doway perceiving that the forbidding of that book did not keep men from reading it, but gave them rather occasion to seek more earnestly after it, thought it better policy that Bertram should be permitted to go abroad, but handled in such sort, as other ancient Writers that made against them were wont to be.

His French Psaltery was so well liked, that it was well translated into the Ger∣mane, Bohemian, English, Scottish, and many Languages, and all the Orthodox Churches use it, and much esteem it. He lived 86 years, and towards his later end began to forget what he had spoken. He would (saith Thuanus) repeat whole Psalms in Hebrew, and what ever Cha∣pter one could name out of Pauls Epistles, he would rehearse it all in Greek, for
the things he had formerly learned his judgement failed him not, but he presently forgat what he had spoken. His French Works are mentioned by Verdier in his Bibliotheque. His Latine are known.

and a Translation of it, a Syriack Translation of the Old Testament, and an A∣rabick Translation of the whole Bible, with Latine Translations to each of them, but it hath not the Interlineary, nor any Apparatus.

Cham. de Canone Tom. 1. l. 12. c. 1.THomas de Vio Cajetanus, an Italian and a Cardinall. A man very well read in Divinity, having studied it even from a childe, who for the happiness of his wit, and for his laborious diligence, became the prime Divine of that and many more ages, unto whom there was no Prelate or person in the Councell who would not yield in Learning, or thought himself too good to learn of him. This Cardinall, going Legate to Germany in the year 1523. studying exactly how those that erred might be reduced to the Church, and the Arch-heretiques convinced, found out the true remedy, which was, the literall meaning of the text of the Scripture in the Originall Tongue in which it was written, and all the residue of his life, which was 11 years, he gave himself to the study of the Scri∣pture, expounding not the Latine Translation, but the Hebrew Roots of the Old, and the Greek of the New Testament. In which Tongues, having no knowledge himself, he imployed men of understanding, who made construction of the Text unto him word by word, as his Works upon the holy Texts do shew. That good Cardinall was wont to say, that to understand the Latine text, was not to under∣stand the infallible Word of God, but the word of the Translator, subject and obnoxious unto errour.

He was a good Writer both in Latine and French, and one to whom our French Language is exceedingly obliged, for having enriched it with many good Treati∣ses; and I would they had been upon a better subject. He was marvellously ver∣sed and skilled, in the books of the holy Scripture, and such a one that if he had turned his spirit the good way, he might have been set for a Paragon of the most famous Doctors of the Church. This and more he hath there of him. I willingly acknowledge him to have been an excellent instrument in the Church of God, and a man of a deep judgement, specially in the Exposition of holy Scri∣pture (which I think none condemn more then those who have read him least) yet withall I freely confess he had his errours.

he was compelled publickly to recant, as Sleyden relates, the other because he was reported in his youth in verse to have praised that which is abominable, and so for severall causes, both of them lost that dignity.

Smeton. ad Hamilton. Apostat. Or∣thodox. Resp. Frier Dominicus Soto, who had a great part in the Synod of Trent, in framing the Decrees of Originall sinne, and Justification, having noted all the opinions and reasons used in those Discussions, thought to communicate them unto the world, and to draw the words of the Decree to his own meaning, printed a Book containing the whole together, and did intitle it De Natura & Gratia, and did Dedicate it with an Epistle to the Councell, to be (as he said in the Dedication) a Commentary of the two foresaid Decrees. Coming to the Article of the certain∣ty of grace, he said in a long Discourse, that the Synod had declared, that a man cannot know he hath grace by so great Certainty, as is that of Faith, excluding all doubt. Catarinus newly made Bishop of Minori, having defended the con∣trary, and still persevering, did print a little book, with an Epistle Dedicatory to the same Synod; the scope whereof was, to maintain that the Councels meaning was not to condemn the opinion of him that saith A just man may know he hath grace, as certainly as he knoweth the Articles of Faith to be true: yea that the Councell hath decided that he is bound to beleeve it, because in the 26 Canon it hath condemned him that faith, That the just man ought not to hope for and expect a reward, it being necessary, that he that ought to hope as a just man, should know he is so. In this contrariety of opinions, both writing affirmatively to the Councell; either of them did not only say that his opinion was the opinion of the Synod, but afterwards wrote also and Printed Apologies and Antipologies, making complaints to the Synod the one of the other, of attributing that to it, which it never said, bringing divers testimonies of the Fathers to prove their own opinion: who bare witness some for one, some for another. This seemed to put all men out of hope to understand the meaning of the Councell, seeing the prin∣cipall men that were present in it did not agree. History of the Conc. of Trent, l. 2. p. 229, 230.

He was Publique Oratour, and Greek Reader in Cambridge. In the discharge of the later he went over Sophocles twice, all Hom, all Euripides, and part of He∣rodotus. Roger Ascham in the first Book of his Epistles, speaking of him and Sir Thomas Smith, saith, Qui si adscribendum se dedissent, nec in Sadoleto Italia, nec in Longolio Gallia, justius, quam in istis duobus Anglia gloriata fuisset. He was the first Regius Professour of the Greek Tongue in Cambridge, as Sir Thomas Smith was of Law. They were both Fellows of the same Colledge, both Professours in the same University, both Officers of State in the same Court, both wrote De pronunciatione linguae Graecae. They two especially by their advice and example brought the study of Tongues, and other politer Learning first into re∣quest in Cambridge. Under God Sir John Cheek was a special instrument of the propagation of the Gospel,Dr L. in the life of Sir John Cheek. and that religion which we now professe in this Kingdom. For he not only sowed the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince Edward, which after∣ward grew up into a general Reformation, when he came to be King, but by his means the same saving truth was gently instilled into the Lady Elizabeth, by those who by his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of her younger stud. In Henry the eighths time his friends and familiars were most of those worthy men which proved Reformers in King Edwards dayes, and either Martyrs or ex∣iles in Queen Maries. His forreign acquaintance were Sleidan, Melancthon, Sturmius, Bucer, Camerarius, Celius, Peter Martyr, and others, great Scholars, and good Protestants. He went into Low-Germany, Vt uxorem educeret, saith Sleiden, to fetch his wife from thence. These words were corrupted into Vxorem duceret by Thuanus and others, for he was married before. In his return from Bruxwels to Antwerp he was apprehended by a Provost-Mar∣tial from King Philip, and so conveighed speedily away to the Tower of London. He was there by threatnings, and other wayes brought to a recantation, for which he was after much troubled, and so died. Sir John Cheeks Works were, Introductio Grammatices, l. 1.

See that Sermon. The first Nicene Councel called by the Emperour Constantine the Great against Arius, who denied the Deity of Christ. This was held in the year of our Lord 325. at Nice in Bithinia. It consisted of 318 Bishops. The Fathers of that Coun∣cel did publish a Creed against the Arians. The greatest of all Councels next to the Apostles Councel, the great Councel of Nice of 318 Bishops. Urbs Nicaea clara à Synodo Nicaena, quo coacti à Magno Constantino primo Chri∣stiano Imperatore convenerunt contra Arium Alexandrinum in Aegypto Diaconum 318 Episcopi, quorum plerique Constantia tempore persecutionis & dono miraculorum clari fuere, teste Eusebio probatissimo Graeco scriptore.

The first Constantinopolitan Councel called by the Emperour Theodosius the elder against Macedonius, who denied the Deity of the holy Ghost, in the year of the Lord 383, or 384. The first Ephesine Councel called by Theodosius the younger against Nestorius, who held, That there were two persons in Christ, in the year 430, or 434. 4. The Chalcedonian Councel called by the Emperour Martian against Euty∣ches, which affirmed. That there was onely one Nature in Christ after the Incar∣nation, in the year of the Lord 451, or as some 452, and others 454. To these two other Councels are added, the fifth, the second Constantinopolitan, in the year 548, or as others reckon it 553. called by Justinian against the Arians, Nestorians, Eutychians. The sixth is the third Constantinopolitan Councel against the Monethelites, in the year 681, called by Constantinus Pognatus or Barbarus.

In this mock-Councel, the Pope which was the principal party accused of He∣resie,
was the onely Judge and disposer of all things passed therein against all good Examples, Laws, Equity and Reason. Though the Councel of Trent hath been sufficiently answered by the Protestant Divines, yet that excellent History of the Councel of Trent was never answered by the Papists. In the Councel of Constance Communion under both kindes, and Wickliffs opi∣nions were condemned. John Hus and Jerom of Prague were burned against faith given, and safe conduct granted by the Emperour. Then that wicked maxim was established, Haereticis fides non est seruanda, which is against Nature, Scripture, and the Law of Nations.

The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countreys, States and Kingdoms where these Churches are, are now of late very profitably published to the just conviction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably distracted and rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith. Beza hath put out the Harmony of Confessions with Notes upon it. The most famous is the Augustane Confession. The Elector of Saxony with the other Princes and Protestant Cities joyned with him, presented to the Emperour Charles the fifth, the Confession of their Faith, written in Latine and Dutch, which afterward from this place, where it was read was called Augustana. It contained two parts: in the first was expounded one and twenty Articles of their Creed. In the second were expounded the Doctrines which were different from the Church of Rome, and the abuses which the Confes∣sionists reproved. The Cities which followed the Doctrine of Zuinglius, present∣ed apart the Confession of their Faith, not differing from the former, but onely in the point of the Eucharist.

Down. of Antichrist, and Crashaw in his Jesuites Gospel, though I cannot purchase it.Crashaw also speaks largely of it in his Sermon preached at Pauls Crosse 9th wound. There was printed at Bononia in Italy, Anno 1590. a book intituled, Liber Conformitatum Beati ac Seraphici Patris Francisci, written by one Bartholomeus Pisanus a Franciscan Frier, and published by one Hieronymus Buchius, of which book it is affirmed in the Title page, that it is Liber Aureus, a golden book. There he paints a tree; at the top whereof is Christ, and at the root St Francis: the tree hath twenty branches on the right, and twenty on the left side, and every branch hath four particular fruits; in all eighty: These are equally divided between Christ and St Francis, fourty to the one, and fourty to the other, and each cou∣ple or pair of these is one point of Conformity between Christ and St Francis, consisting in all upon fourty particulars, wherein they begin at the birth, and the conception, nay at the very Prophecies and Promises made of Christ, and so pro∣ceed to his life, his death, his resurrection and ascension: and in all, and every of these, and every thing else whatsoever may be said of Christ, the very same do they not shame to affirm of that man Francis.
This was not the superfluity of idle and superstitious Monks brains, but the pub∣lick Act of their Church, and many Popes one after another allowed it, and by their Charters have confirmed the truth of this Story.

His Defence of Constantine, and others of his Works of Logick and Physick are good. Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, Martyr. He died a Mar∣tyr anno 1556 Cranmer a furtherer of learning and godlinesse.He was the first Archbishop of Canterbury that cast off Antichrist. As Britain was most blessed under Edward the sixths Reign, so much by his means. That he might settle the Doctrine of the Gospel in both the Univer∣sities, he sent for the most famous Divines out of forraign Naions, and drew them into England, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Fagius, Lascus, Immanuel Tremellius, Ber∣nardus Ochinus, All which with their wives and children were liberally maintained by him. This way he spent his yearly revenew, so that nothing remained to himself.
He studied the Scriptures diligently and wrote against that grosse opinion of the Papists, affirming the carnal presence of Christ in the Sacrament,His English Books are men∣tioned by An∣drew Maunsel in his Catalogue of English books a Book filled with so much learning and plenty of arguments, that that controversie seems to be handled by none more accurately against the Papists. Steven Gardiner Bishop of Winchester being prisoner in the Tower by stealth, and largely inveighed against this Book, in that Book which he named Marcus Constantius. This Peter Martyr learnedly refuted Cranmer being dead. After the death of King Edward, when Cranmer was advised by his friends to flie, If I were (saith he) accused of theft, treason, parricide,Hoc in Cran∣mero admira∣bile visum est, quod etsi mi∣tissimus ac fa∣cillimus in omnibus rebus judicaretur, tamen si divinam veritatem labefactari aut oppugnari à quocunque sentiret, nemo unquam in bellis Imperator majorem animi magnitudinem constantiamque declararet. Antiq. Eccles. Britan. p. 341. or any other wic∣kednesse, I could be induced to flie much more easily then in this cause. For when the Question is not concerning my faith toward men, but toward God, and con∣cerning my constancy in the truth of the holy Scripture against Popish errours, I would rather in this case lose my life then leave the Kingdom. When King Henry purposed to imprison his Daughter Mary being stiffe for the Popish faction, only Cranmer interceded and mitigated the Kings anger, but the ill will that Queen Mary bore him for having a hand in her Mothers Divorce, that inveterate hatred (I say) toward him, blotted out all his friendly Offices to her.

His Epistles and Greek Liturgy, and other things go under his name, but our Divines generally hold them to be supposititions, and so some of the Learned Papists hold.

He was admirable by reason of his rare towardness and hope both of Vertue and Learning, which in him appeared above the capacity of his years. Favour and love of Religion was in him from his childhood. Such an instrument given of God to the Church of England he was, as England never had better.
Cardan saith this of him: Being but fifteen years of age, he asked of me in Latine, (in which tongue he uttered his minde no lesse readily and eloquently then I could do my self) what my Books which I had Dedicated unto him De varietate Rerum did contain? Cardan made answer, and the King wittily replied severall times, as Mr Fox in his 2d Book of Acts and Monum. p. 65. relates. He restored holy Scriptures to the mother Tongue, he abolished Masses; such as were in banishment for the danger of the truth, were again received to their Country. During the time of the six years of this King there was much tranquility to the whole Church of England.

Isidore Pelusiota hath excellently handled the greatest part of the mysteries of our Faith, and the controversies agitated both against the Jews and Hereticks, and yet he entitleth his Book Epistles. Saint Basil the Great, Gregory Nazianzene, Synesius Bishop of a City in Cyrene, Cyril of Alexandria, St Cyprian, St Austin, Gregory the Pope, St Bernard, and other Fathers of the Eastern and Western Churches, do not speak more powerfully any where, then in their Epistles.

That he did not set down the divers readings very exactly. 2. That he did not relate the number of the Manuscripts, which he used, and where they were to be seen. From the Collation of Greek and ancient Copies, he corrected also all the New Testament. Ingeniosus veterum Scriptorum Censor; So Ludovicus Vives.

None of the Divines of Paris had a greater concourse of all sorts of Degrees, and was more admired for his frequent Sermons to the people then he. He was ve∣ry eloquent. There are many Questions concerning Religion discussed by him in Latine and French with great subtilty.
His Commentaries upon Timothy and Titus are well liked. He hath published many other Works. Petrus Espinacus Archbishop of Lions. A witty and eloquent man, at first addicted to the Doctrine of the Protestants,Archiepisco∣pus Lugdumen∣sis, quia in adolescentia Protestantium doctrinam professus, postea mutaverat, & impotenti in eos odio ferebatur: verone an adfectato ad consequendam Cardinalis dignitatem, quam perditè ambiebat, incertum: de cetero doctus & vehementi facundia praeditus.

He is taxed for an Arian, Gerhard in his Patrologia saith he was so, and alledgeth authority for it, yet he is justified by others, he is therefore to be read with the greater caution, as to that partcular, for he much favoured that opinion, though he subscribed the Nicene Councel.

The several courses he took for the restoring of Learning in France, Antoine du Verdier mentions in his learned Preface to his Bibliotheque, and in his Book, he saith, He was deservedly called the father of Learning, because he planted in his Kingdom both Hebrew, Greek and Latine, and gave great salaries to the choice men of all Europe in all Learning, to reade publickly in the University of Paris. See more there. To one that desired pardon for another that had used ill speeches of his Majesty, this King said, Let him for whom thou art a Sutor, learn to speak little, and I will learn to pardon much. Thevet and Postellus travelled into the East to procure him rare Books for his Li∣brary. The death of King Francis chanced unfortunately for Students and learned men. For he loved all Liberal Sciences, no man btter, nor shewed more liberality to advance the same. Through long use and custom, he had gotten much knowledge. For dining and supping his talk was commonly of Learning, and that most earnest∣ly
using many years for the same purpose James Coline a learned man, and in the vulgar tongue most eloquent. And after him Peter Castellan. Of these two had he learned, whatsoever was written in the books of Poets, Historiographers and Cosmographers. Moreover he knew perfectly whatsoever Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny, and such other like, have written of the nature of Plants, Herbs, Beasts, Metals and precious Stones, and by daily use and hearing did remember them. He was wont also to conferre much of the Mathematical Sciences, and to reason oft of the Scriptures. In his own Tongue he was alwayes accounted right eloquent and grave. Throughout Greece and Italy he had those that sought and copied out for him the Works of old Writers, and he made a great Library. The Keeper whereof was Castellane. Sleid. Comment. l. 19. p. 283.

Verit. l. 15.A Divine of Paris right famous, he was present at the Councell of Constance, and in books written he commendeth highly the Decree whereby it is agreed that the Bishop of Rome should be subject to the Counsell. And saith the thing is worthy to be written in all Churches and publick places, for a perpetuall me∣mory. For he saith they are pestilent flatterers which bring this Tyranny into the Church, as though the Bishop of Rome ought neither to obey the Counsell, nor be judged by the same, as though the Counsell should take all its force and authority from him, as though it could not be called but at his pleasure, as though he were bound to the observation of no Laws, nor no accompt might be taken of his doings. These monstrous sayings must be utterly rejected, which are against all Laws equity and reason. For all the authority of the Church dependeth on the generall Counsell, and it is lawfull to appeal from the Pope unto it: and those which inquire whether the Bishop of Rome or the Church be greater, make as wise a question as if they should ask whether the part be more, or the whole, for it appertaineth to the Counsell, to constitute, to judge, and to depose the Bishop of Rome, as lately it was declared at Constance.

He was an humble, devout, and holy Bishop, and had many pious Mar∣tyrs his Predecessors as Popes or Fathers in that See of Rome: he deserved the title of Gregory the Great for abhorring the name of Universall Bishop.
Bede cals him Apostolum nostrum our Apostle, and he gives this reason for it, quod nostram, id est, Anglorum gentem de potestate Satanae ad fidem Christi sua in∣dustria convertit, because he converted our Nation by his own industry from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ. He sent Austen the Monk and other Legates hither. See Pet. du Moulins Antibarbarian, ch. 13. He first wrote Servus Servorum Dei, putting the Roman Bishops in remem∣brance thereby, both of their humblenesse, and also of their duty in the Church of Christ.

He was chosen for the Papists Champion, in the famous Disputation holden at Regensperg, 1600; whom Possevine the Jesuite cals the very hammer of the Heretiks. Grindall, a Learned Divine. Johannes Groperus of Collen was offered the Cardinalship by Paul the 4th,Johannes Grop∣perus Germa∣nus Dignita∣tem Cardinalis ultro oblatam, quam caeteri morrales plerunque ardentissimis votis ambiunt, rara hoc aevo modestia & animi magnitudine repudiavit. Thuan. Hist. Tom. 1. l. 16. but he was then old, and thinking to honour his memory much more by refusing a
Dignity, desired even by great Princes, then by keeping it a few daies, he sent the Pope many thanks, together with his excuse, and refusing the Ornaments, would neither have the Name nor Title. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, lib. 5. p. 396, 397. This was after a sort commendable, but his forsaking the Gospel mentioned by Sleidan in his 15 Book of Commentaries, was most wicked. Hugo Grotius.

Meibomii Maecenas c. 4. in the year of our Lord 1583. He hath written upon all the Old and New Testament. His Books De Veritate Religionis Christianae, and De Satisfactione Christi are well esteemed. Piscator sent these verses to him when he published Martianus Capella. Magnus es ingenio, doctrina magnus es idem, Nomini, & magni. Magna cupido tibi est, Non temere ergo tibi, sed cum ratione, locuta Cognomen Grotî Belgica lingua dedit. He was a very Learned Lawyer, but fell off much from soundness and Orthodoxy in the true Religion in his later daies. Voetius in his 2d part of Select. Theolog. Disputat. De Conversione Judaeorum reck∣ons him among the men dubiae aut variate Religionis. Some Learned and Orthodox French Divines, as Rivet, Maresius, and others also have written solidly against him. Therefore his diligent Translatour might perhaps have been better imployed, then in turning into English his Vow for the Churches Peace, a book so empty and Heterodox, and so well refuted by the Learned Rivet in his Apoligeticus pro vera Pace Ecclesiae.

Amongst the most famous Contradictors, which the Doctrine of Luther found, was Henry the 8th King of England, who not being born the Kings eldest son, had been destinate by his Father to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and therefore in his youth was made to study: But the eldest being dead, and after him the father also, he succeeded in the Kingdom. Esteeming it a great honour to imploy himself in so famous a Controversie of Learning, he wrote a Book of the seven Sacraments, defending also the Popedom, and oppugning the Doctrine of Luther: a thing so gratefull to the Pope, that having received the Kings book, he honoured him with the title of Defender of the Faith. But Martin suffered not himself to be scared with that most illustrious glittering name of a King, but answered his Majesty with as much acrimony, vehemency, and as small respect, as he had answered the petty Doctors.

He had at hand a great paper-book, as it were a rich treasury of Sciences, in which he wrote his divine and humane collections out of Poets, Philosophers and Divines. We call it a Common-place book.

The best in my judgement is to note in the Margent, or in some pa∣per-book for that purpose the Summe and Method of that which you reade. In other little Books which he carried about with him (an Epheerides or Diary) he diligently wrote all the Apophthegmes and witty speeches, or jests which he heard from others, or observed any way, by which means he much increased his knowledge yearly.

He was given to Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia to be instructed, of whom also he learned the Doctrine of the Church and was made a Reader in the Church of Nicomedia. But he was a hearer secretly of Libanius the Rhetorician, and was fa∣miliarly acquainted with the most famous Philosophers of that time. He was drawn back by these by degrees to the Heathenish Religion. He wrote Books against the Christians, and reproved their Doctrine, especially the prohibitions of revenge delivered, which, though they properly belong to private revenge, yet he wrested them for publick revenge, and he said by these, Magistrates, punishments, lawfull warres were taken away, and all the sinews of retaining humane Societies. Ammianus Marcellinus commends his Temperance in meat and drink, and his continual watching, and the partition of the night into private, publick and di∣vine offices. He took away the great Gifts and holy Vessels which Constantine the Grea had given to the Churches use, and Ministers maintena, with this scoff, See in what goodly vessels this Nazarite is served. It was one of his scoffs when he robbed the Churches and the Christians, He did it that the Galileans (so he contumeliously called the Christians) might go more rea∣dily to heaven. He not onely killed the Christians, but scoffed at Christ himself and the Scri∣ptures. He had scarce raigned two years, when warring against the Persians, he was struck and mortally wounded with a Spear in that warre, as Nazianzen, Theodo∣, Sorais, Sozomen, and oters nore dcent, and filling his hand with bloud, csting it into the air, he cried out, Vicesti Galilaee, Ita simul & victorim confessus est, & blasphemiam evomit, saith Theodoret.

A famous Philosopher, and a great Defender of Christian Religion, who first exhibited unto the Emperour Antoninus Pius, and to the Senate, an Apology in the Defence of the Christians, and afterward himself also died a Martyr. He flourished in the Church after Christ about the year 150, so Zanchy. Others say 163. He is the ancientest of the Fathers (whose writings remain) except Clement. He lived in the very next Age to the Apostles, and Tertullian lived the next Age to him. He was first allured to the Faith by the cruelty of Tyrants, and by the constancy and patience of Gods Saints. In the year of Christ 163. he suffered Martyrdom for the faith under Mareus Aurelius Antoninus the Philosopher, and Lucius Verus Emperours.

As one whose birth and education was noble, he adorned the Papacy with many good parts which he brought into it, amongst which were his singular Learning in humanity, goodnesse, and a marvellous sweet manner in treating of affairs, together with a pleasing behaviour, more then humane, joyned with incompa∣rable liberality, and a great inclination to favour those that were Learned, and endowed with any extraordinary quality; which vertues were not found in that Sea of a long time before, neither equall nor near unto his. And he would have been a Pope absolutely compleat, if with these he had joyned some knowledge in things that concern Religion, and some more propension unto piety, of both which he seemed carelesse. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, l. 1. parag. 12. He was son unto Laurence Medices, and had to his great grandfather Cosmus, that was the great honour of that House.

About the year 1322, he began to illustrate the Bible with Scholia, which work within seven years after he finished and published. He distinguisheth and separates the Apocryphall books (viz. Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobi∣as, the books of the Macchabees) from the Canonicall. In that Work many things occurre, which do not agree with the Popish superstitions, and do demon∣strate that Lyra could have exprest many things more fitly, if he had been born in a better age.

Also the hang-man kneeled down to him, asking him forgivenesse of his death, as the manner is. To whom he answered, I forgive thee; but I promise thee that thou shalt never have honour of the striking off my head, my neck is so short. Also, even when he should lay down his neck on the block, he having a great gray-beard, stroaked out his beard, and said to the hang-man, I pray you let me lay my beard over the block, least you should cut it; others relate it thus, that he said, it never committed treason; thus with a mock he ended his life.

He wrote exceeding much, yet there remaineth now little in comparison of that he wrote, and that so corrupted, that it nothing answereth the famous report of Learning which he had in the Church in his time. All his Works now extant revi∣sed by Erasmus, were printed at Basil by Frobenius, 1536. He was in his Age a mirrour of gravity, integrity, constancy, zeal, piety, learning of all sorts, both divine and humane, of so happy a memory that he had the Bible without book, of such admirable eloquence, that not words but honey seemed to drop from his lips; of so indefatigable industry, that he was called A∣damantius, and was said by some to have written six thousand books.

That is incommunicable to us. 2. If that had been required to our Justification, Christ needed not to have been incarnate. Paul saith Rom. 5.19. We are made righteous by the obedience of one man.

An eloquent man, and too precise a follower of Tully. In his Book against Luther and Doctor Haddon he dares not name the words of Justification or Pre∣destination. And I wonder (saith Mr. Fox) that he dares insert the name of Christ in his Books, since it is not found in Tully. Nec Justificationis aut praedestinationis vocabula ipsa vel nominare audes. Ac miror equidem, quod Christi nomen, quod apud Ciceronem nunquam legitur, non dubites libellis tuis inspergere. His Book De gloria is most esteemed.

He was Secretary for the Latine Tongue to King Henry the eighth. He was of great ripenesse of wit, learning and eloquence, also expert in for∣raign Languages. He was sent in the Kings affairs Embassadour to Venice, which function there he so discharged, that it is hard to say, whether he procured more commendation or admiration among the Venetians, for his dexterity of wit, and specially for the singular promptnesse in the Italian Tongue. For opinion and fame of Learning, he was accepted, not onely here in England with Linacre, Gro∣cinus, Mere, and others, but also known and reported abroad in such sort, that in all the great heap of Erasmus his Epistles, he wrote almost to none so many, as to him.

Pelagius a Britain by birth, and a Monk at Rome 382 years after Christ. To prove that he was a Britain, Beda in his History quotes that verse out of Prosper Aquitanicus, Pestifero vomuit coluber sermone Britannus.

Verg. Angl. Mist. l. 3. p. 56.At the first Pelagius only praised Free-will, after indeed to decline envy, he began to use the term of Grace, but he understood only by it, that God had made us of Free-will, and preserves us in it. Against him wrote Austen, Hierom, Cyrillus, Orsius, Innocentius, Gennadius, and at the last Thomas Bradwardine a Doctor here in England. The Pelagians were so called from him, and also Caelestiani from Caelestius one of Pelagius his Scholers. These taught that death was not the wages of sin, but that Adam should have died, though he had not sinned. That Adams sinne was hurtfull only to himself, and not to his posterity: That concupiscence was no sinne: That Infants did not draw Originall sinne from their Parents:
That man after the Fall had free will to do good. John Pell, a learned Mathematician of our own Country. He hath written against Longomantanus de vera circuli mensura.

He was born in the year 1304. and died in the year 1374. having lived 70 years wanting but a day. There is in his Latine Works a neat expression, a spirit sinewy and sententious, a style short and concise. He was another Seneca. He calleth Rome the Whore of Babylon, the School and mother of errour, the Temple of heresie, the nest of treachery, and seemeth plainly to affirm, that the Pope was Antichrist, declaring that no greater evil could happen to any man, then to be made Pope. His life is written by Papirius Massonus. There was great flocking after him, from France and all Italy. Sacras literas, ut humiles & incomptas, & humanioribus impares nimio illarum amore, & contemptu harum, & opinione de se falsa, atque impotenti inventa, diù tumidus adolescens, fugit.

Bucolica, Eclogae: & alia venustissima Poemata quae scripsit lingua Hetrusca: and other Works mentioned by Boissard in his Icones. His Ancestors were Florentines, and lived in exile, but he returned home and died in his own Country of an Apoplexy. He was buried at Arquato Montanere, a village belonging unto Padua, where in honour of him a Sepulchre of Marble was built, and an Epitaph of his own making inscribed, part whereof is as fol∣loweth, Frigida Francisci lapis hic regit ossa Fessus{que} in terris, caeli requiescit in arce. Petronius Arbiter, an obscene Writer, yet his Latine is pure and elegant. Elmenhorstius in the life of John Wower cals Petronius Impurissimum scriptorem purissimae latinitatis.Multae erudi∣tionis homi∣nem Petronium fuisse facilè cognoscimus, nam in taxandis moribus cum acrem, tum festivum maximè, & jocis seria, miscentem videmus.

He denied the Deity of the Sonne and Holy Ghost. Whence the Photinians. There are two main parts of the Socinian Religion. The first concerning the Person of Christ, Photinianism. The other the Grace of Christ, Pelagianism. Photius Patriark of Constantinople, he flourished in the 9th age, Anno Dom. 860. the learnedst man of his time.Vir omnium Graecorum sui saeculi longe eruditissimus, floruit autem Anno 879. vivere desiit Anno 889.

Huic Thuanus post elaboratus in B. Matthaeum & Lucam Commentaries auctor fuerat, ut in Paullum scriberet, & ille eo auctore munus injunctum alacriter susceperat; quod in eo interpretandi genere paucos admodum digne se exercuisse arbitraretur, nam extra caussam religionis diligentiam Th. Bezae laudabat, sed post ejus messem mag∣num sibi & aliis spicilegium relictum dicebat. Sed mala sorte accidit, ut haut multo post placidissima ejus morte secuta∣res omnis ad haeredes devenerit, homines litigiosos, qui dum se Cadmea victoria utrinque conficiunt, pretiosam illam avunculi supellectilem dissipari & in manus alienas transire passi sunt, à quibus vix spes est ut redimi & ad publicam utilitatem prodire possint. Thuan. Comment. de vita sua l. 4. We may judge of his great abilities, by those little Tracts de Coena Dominica, de Missae sacrificio, de Igne purgatorio, de Imaginum usu, and some other things that way, and likewise of his little difference from us in the weightiest points of our Religion, the more pity is it, that his excellent Notes on a great part of the New Testament should so unhappily perish after his death, as Thuanus re∣lates.
Jo. Pierius Valerianus. He hath written an admirable Discourse of the Egyptian , sive ut vx sonat, sacrae scripturae, ni∣hil aliud erant, quam animalium mutarumque rerum figurae, ab Aegyptiis loco literarum in sacris usurpatae, ne à vulgo intellige∣rentur.

With other Latine and Italian books of his printed, mentioned there before his Epistles. As he was well acquainted with Joannes Vincentius Pinellus, Marcus Velserus, Paulus Aicardus, Janus Gruterus, Hieronymus Aleander, and many other learned men, so he had Imagines virorum Clarissimorum in his study, many of those before mentioned, and also Bellarmine, Baronius, Francis Petrake, Pancirolus, Torqua∣tus Tassus, Tully, Onufrius Panvinius.

Id ibid. He was skilled in Hebrew, Greek, Latine, Spanish, French. He adorned the most inward rooms of his house with greater Geographicall Tables or Mapes, and with the Icones of illustrious men. He had Books sent him out of all Europe. He is much commended by Gassendus in vita Peireskii p. 30, 31. John Piscator. He was an excellent Scripture-Divine, but no School-Divine, and therefore no marvell if he want the accuratenesse of Scholasticall expressions. Dr Twisse a∣gainst Hoord, l. 2.

Casaubone never saw him (as Thuanus in the 6th book of his Commenta∣ries concerning his own life saith) yet how doth he extoll him? He had rare and exact knowledge in all Antiquity, Ecclesiasticall history and other wayes. His disposition was sweet, and he farre from all ambition and deceit, he was very prudent and skilfull in mannaging affairs.
Thuanus in the first part of the fifth Tome of his Hist. l. 117. much commends him, and at last concludes thus of him, that in the Civill Law of the Romans, he came to that height, that it might be justly said of him, and his most famous Ma∣ster Cuiacius, Hunc discipulo praeripuisse, ne primus Jurisconsultus esset, illum prae∣ceptori, ne solus. All the great men of this age (saith Papirius Massonus in his Elogia) make honourable mention of him in their books, and some of these dedicate their Wri∣tings to him and his brother Francis, as the lights of France. Many of his Books are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

He was especially famous for his Work de vitis Pontificum usque ad Paulum II. by whom he was cast into prison and detained four whole moneths, when he un∣dertook to defend the cause of Pomponius Laetus, and other learned men, which were said to have conspired against him.

His Lives and Morals were his best Works. His Lives make an abridgement of all the best things contained in the Greek and Latine Histories. He was a follower of Plato, but an enemy to the Epicures and Stoicks. Plutarchus totius antiquitatis rimator, & indaegator tam curiosus, libro aureo de sera numinis vindicta. Herald. Animadvers.

Theodorus Gaza a Grecian born, of singular learning, being once asked by his familiar friends, which saw him so greatly affectioned to his study, what Authour he would choose amongst many, if he could keep but one alone, he answered Plutarke, because there is none so profitable and delightfull also to reade as he.

He is honourably mentioned by Gerhard on Peter, and other outlandish men. His learned notes in Specimen hist. Arabum, and Miscellaneous Notes in Portam Mosis give good evidence of his abilities, and I hope as he in the book last quoted
very learnedly and profitably handleth the places of Scripture which he treateth of, so he will improve his knowledge in the Orientall Tongues for the illustrating of divers passages in Scripture.

In Calvins Epistles and Answers Bullinger writes to Calvin, that England had returned to the Pope and Popery, and that the devil to recover it had used two speciall instruments, the Bishop of Winchester within the Kingdom, and Cardinall Poole without it, who then was made Archbishop of Canterbury. And he shews there that Cardinall Poole was received with great solemnity at Pauls Crosse in London; and that the Bishop of Winchester in that Assembly revoked the Oration which he had before published under Henry the 8th, de Obedientia, and that Car∣dinall Poole when he spake to Queen Mary, blasphemously used the words of the Angell, Ave Maria gratia plena, Dominus tecum.

Trithem. Catal Illust. Vir.John Reuchlin, or Capnio, which name (from the Germane being made Greek) Hermolaus Barbarus gave him, when he was sent by Maximilian the Emperour to Rome. His chief praise is, that he stirred up the study of the Hebrew tongue in Germany. He first of all wrote an Hebrew Grammer with great perspicuity in Latine. He invited many to learn and study the Hebrew tongue, and they received the seeds of that doctrine from him. He was skilfull in the Law, a great Linguist, and generall Scholer.

He was invited to Millaine, by Lewis the 12th King of France, who gave him a great and royall stipend: he taught Greek and Latine there with great praise.

But he especially got himself immortall fame by his 30 Books of ancient readings, in which work the abstruse words of both languages are interpreted, obscure places in many excellent writers are explained, corruptions purged, and ancient rites manifested, many secrets drawn out of Phi∣losophy.

Being a Monk in Italy, and singularly well learned, he preached sore against the evil life of the spiritualty, and specially of his own Order, complaining sore upon them, as the Authours of all mischiefs and wickednesse. Whereupon by the help of certain learned men, he began to seek Reformation in his own Order. He threatned Italy with the wrath and indignation of God, and prophesied before unto them, that the Land should be overthrown for the pride and wickednesse of the people, and for the untruth, hypocrisie and falshood of the Clergy, which God would not leave unrevenged, as afterward it came to passe, when Charles the French King came into Italy and to Rome, and so straitly beset the Pope Alex∣ander, that he was forced to make composition with him.

In the first Volume of the Lord of Plessis his Lettres & Memoires, Casaubone relating to him Scaligers death, saith, This losse of so learned a man, wrought in him an incredible grief, and that he for his particular had lost another Father, and saith, That he had the honour to be loved by him, and that he much honoured him according to his merit, and addes, That those which of late have so calumniated him, will not spare now to reproach him much more; but (saith he) he will not want such as will vindicate him, Dum quidem literis melioribus suus honor stabit. Mounsieur Du Plessis likewise condoles with him in so great a losse, and saith, That Scaliger indeed made one of the integral parts of the better Learning of this Age, but (saith he) he was aged, and therefore to have lived longer would have been but a burden; and he doubts not likewise but the Jesuites would insult over this dead Lion, but it makes for Scaligers honour (quoth he) to have such Adver∣saries, V omnis boni osores, ita & omnibus exosos. And I assure my self, that when they shall attempt it, they shall not do it impune, as long as you shall live, which ought therefore to redouble your courage, that so Christianity may finde a supply of the other want in your increased abilities, as Physicians say, when one eye is lost, the other sees the better.

And addes, That in all that while in which he was acquainted with him, he never heard him dispute of the controverted points of Religion, or that he knew was he accu∣stomed to write to others about them, Neque vero (saith he) nisi provocatus de iis nec nisi invitissimus disserebat; and concludes thus, Quasi vero extra Religionis caussam non multa praeclara & supra captum, quantum ad literas, humanum in ea admiranda essent, quae bonus quisque ab eo cognoscere & doceri merito cuperet, & pro∣pter tam raras in eum à Deo camulat as doies non ipse observari ac praecipua veneratione à bonis quibusque mereretur.

B. Vsh. Answ. to the Jes. Challenge. He is described to be of a sharp wit, of great eloquence, and well expert in the Greek Tongue, pleasant and merry of nature and conditions, as appeareth by di∣vers his doings and answers. First, He coming to France out of his own Countrey of Scotland (so saith Mr Fox) by reason of great tumults of warre, was there worthily entertained, and for his Learning had in great estimation of Carolus Calvus the French King; whom he commonly and familiarly used to have about him, both at Table, and in Chamber. Mr Foxes Acts aud Monum. Vol. 1. p. 186, 187. Mat∣thaeus West∣monasteriensis. p. 171. hath the same.Upon a time the King sitting at meat, and seeing something (belike in this John Scot) which seemed not very courtly, cast forth a merry word, asking of him, What difference there was betwixt a Scot and a Sot? Whereunto the Scot sitting over against the King, somewhat lower, replied again suddenly, rather then advi∣sedly, yet merrily, saying, Mensa tantúm, that is, the Table onely: importing thereby himself to be the Scot, and so calling the King a Sot by craft. Another time the same King being at Dinner was served with a certain dish of fish, wherein were two great fishes, and a little one. After the King had taken thereof his repast, setteth down to Johannes Scotus the foresaid fish to distribute unto the other two Clerks, sitting there with him: which were two tall and migh∣ty persons, he himself being but a little man. Johannes taketh the fish, of the which, the two great he taketh and carveth to himself; the little fish he reacheth to the other two. The King perceiving his division thus made, reprehended the same. Then Johannes, whose manner ever was to finde out some honest matter to delight the King, answered to him again, proving his division to stand just and equal: For here (saith he) be two great, and a little, pointing to the two great fishes and
himself: and likewise here again is a little one, and two great, pointing to the lit∣tle fish, and two great persons: I pray you (saith he) what distribution can be more equal? Whereat the King with his Nobles being much delighted, laughed merrily. He was impiously murthered and slain by his Scholars with their pen-knives at Malmesbury.Joannes Scotus alias Erigena dictus scripsit Commentarios in libros Dionysii de Hierarchia: in quorum enarratione, cum taxaret opinionem tum receptani, de oblatione Coenae Dominicae pro vivis & mortuis, à discipulis, Monachorum impulsu graphiis est interfectus: an∣no Domini 884. in Monasterio Malmesberiensi, qua recreationis gratia se contulerat.

That he was the Author of that Book, appears both by an Epistle of Andreas Schottus the Jesuite, whose Autograph is yet kept, and also by the Catalogue of the Writers of that Society published by Ribadeneira at Antwerp, in which it is ex∣presly mentioned, that Carolus Scribanius was the Authour of the four Books of the Amphitheater of honour.

As if you should say Doctrinale, in which the Jews have made as it were their Canon Law, and their Divinity out of the sentences and examples of their ancient Doctors, after the same manner that Peter Lombard the book of Sentences, and Gra∣tian the Decrees among the Papists. That work was first begun as the Jews them∣selves, Masius, Genebrard and Petrus Galatinus have recorded, within two hun∣dred years from the Nativity of Christ, although it was long after finished, at least the Babylonian Talmud, for the Talmud of Jerusalem was sooner published. See Buxtorfs Bibliotheca concerning the Editions of these two Talmuds. There are two parts of the Talmud, the Mischna containing the Text of the Talmudical Law. This came out about the year of Christ 150. This was read, explained and disputed in the Academies of Jerusalem and Babylon. Those dispu∣tations and the decisions of them were called Gemara. So of the Mischna and Gemara came the Jerusalem Talmud Anno Christi 230. But the Babylonish Talmud more perfect and copious, finished about the year of Christ 500.

There are two witty Epigrams made of him, the one by way of censure, viz. this, Nunc postquam manes defunctus Valla petivit, Non audet Pluto verba Latina loqui. Jupiter hunc Coeli dignatus honore fuisset; Censorem linguae sed timet esse suae. The other by way of Commendation, thus Fatales post quam soluit Laurentius annos. Extimuit tantum Rhetora Phito nocens.
Jupiter hunc sacro non dedignatus Olympo, Facundo Maiae praeposuit genito. There is this Elogy also of him, Laureus Valla jacet, Romanae gloria linguae; Primus enim docuit, qua decet arte loqui.

Thuan. Histor. Tom. 1. lib. 5. Vide etiam ejus Tom. 2. lib. 28. an eloquent Lawyer and Phlosopher. The Bishops of Rome, Clement and Paul used his service in Germany. He was in high favour with King Ferdinando, so much that when his daughter Katharine was born, Vergerius and George Marquesse of Bran∣derburg, and John Archbishop of Lunden were her Godfathers at the Font. But after he revolted from the Bishop of Rome by a wonderfull occasion, when he was sent for to Rome from the Conference of Wormes, which was in the beginning of the year 1541. The Pope going about to make new Cardinals, appointed him also among others. But there were some which privily whispered in his ear, that he was now through much familiarity with the Germans become a Lutherane. After that Ver∣gerius had heard this by Cardinal Ginucius, unto whom the Pope had told it, he was marvellously astonished. And to the intent he might purge himself, he goeth home into his Countrey, and beginneth a book, which he entitled, against the A∣postates of Germany. And whilst to confute their Arguments, he turneth over diligently the books of his Adversaries,Sleid. Comment. l. 21. fol. 329. See more there. and pondering deeply their reasons: He feeleth himself taken and vanquished. Then casting away all hope of his Cardinalship, he goeth to his brother John Baptist Bishop of the City of Pole, and reciting the whole matter, asketh his counsel. His brother being afraid at the beginning, lamenteth his case much. But after he was perswaded by him to apply himself to the searching of the Scripture, and had considered diligently that Article of Justification, comparing the sentences together, he giveth place, and judgeth the Bishop of Romes Doctrine to be false. Whereupon they rejoyced together. And as the duty of Bishops is, began to instruct the people in Istria, and preach diligently the benefit of Christ im∣ploy'd upon mankinde, and declare what works God requireth of us, to the intent they might call men again to the true Religion.

Some compare him with Homer, nay prefer him before him; others style him Homer in Latine. This was said upon the coming forth of Virgils Aeneads. Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii, Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade. He set this Distick upon the Palace-gate of the Emperour Augustus, Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane, Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet. As much to say, God sheweth his power by the night rains, Caesar his magnifi∣cence by the pomps of the day. These two Verses were very well liked, and brought to the Emperours Majesty, who took great pleasure in them, and willed the Authour should be known. A sausie Courtier pretended to be the man, and had a good reward given him, for the Emperour himself was not only learned, but very munificent toward all learned men. Virgil seeing himself by his overmuch modesty defrauded of the reward, which an impudent person had gotten by abuse of his merit, came the next night, and fastened upon the same place this half Metre, four times iterated, thus Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. And there it remained a great while, because no man wist what it meant, till Virgil opened the whole fraud by this devise. He wrote about the same half Metres this whole Verse hexameter, Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores. Sic vos non vobis Fertis aratra boves. Sic vos non vobis Vellera fertis oves. Sic vos non vobis Mellificatis apes. Sic vos non vobis Nidificatis aves. And then finished the four half Metres, thus And put to his name Publius Virgilius Maro. This matter came by and by to the Emperours ear, who taking great pleasure in the devise, called for Virgil, and gave him not only a present reward, but also held him ever after upon larger triall he had made of his Learning and Vertue in so great reputation, as he vouchsafed to give him the name of Amicus, which among the Romans was a great honour and special favour. He made a Talisman, or brazen Fly, which he set upon one of the gates of the City Naples. which for the space of eight years kept all manner of Flies from com∣ing into the City. Gaffarels Unheard of Curiosities, Part. 2. Chap. 7. See more there. The purity of his style and conceptions is generally known, and the purity of his manners, was once admired by those of Naples, which for this reason common∣ly called him Parthenius.

Annaeus Viterbiensis. A Monk by profession, who lived some two hundred years ago, having attained to more then ordinary knowledge both of the Tongues and Histories, applied him∣self by his knowledge and proficiency, not to help, but to cheat the world. To that end he counterfeited divers ancient Historians of best note and greatest anti∣quity, as Berosus, Manotho, Catonis Origines, and the like, which had not been heard of in many ages; and wrote Comments upon them, these passed so current for a long time, that even to this day (though descryed by divers learned men of all Nations and professions) many can scarce perswade themselves, that so many fine titles and shows should be but a piece of juggling. Scaliger in his Elench Orat. Chronol. Parei cals him Fanaticum Dominicanum. And elsewhere in that Book he saith, Vt doctior videatur, mendacia sua auctoritate priscorum auctorum fmare conatur.

Our Historians confound the Albigenses and Waldenses, though some learned men hold they are to be distinguished. The Waldenses are famous for their Antiquity, Universality and Innocency. The first original of the Waldenses came of Waldus, a man of great substance in the City of Lions. About the year of our Lord 1160. divers of the best of the
City of Lions talking and walking in a certain place after their old accustomed manner, especially in the Summer time, conferred together upon matters. A∣mongst whom it chanced one (the rest looking upon) to fall down by sudden death. This Waldus being one of them, who beholding the matter more earnestly then the other, and terrified with so heavy an example, Gods holy Spirit working with all, was stricken with a deep and inward repentance, whereupon followed a new alteration with a carefull study to reform his former life. He admonished others also to repent, and ministred large alms of his goods to such as needed.Foxes Acts and Monum. vol. 1 p. 299. See more there. Ma∣ny people therefore daily resorting to him, and he seeing them ready and diligent to learn, he began to give out to them certain rudiments of the Scripture, which he had translated himself into the French Tongue. The Bishops seeing him so to intermeddle with Scriptures, and to have such re∣sort about him, albeit it was but in his own house under private conference, threat∣ned to excommunicate him, if he did not leave so to do. He despising their Ex∣communication, they ceased not with prison, with sword and banishment to per∣secute him, till at length they had driven both Waldus and all the favourers of his true preaching out of the City. Whereupon came first their name, and they were called Waldenses, or Pauperes de Lugduno, because they being thrust out both of Countrey and goods, were compelled to live poorly whether they would or no.

Test. Ver.Wesselus Groningensis, otherwise named Basilius. He preceded Luther, he was excellently learned in Physick, Divinity, in the Greek, Hebrew and Latine, and therefore of the people he was called Lux mundi, the light of the world, whom Luther was wont to call his prodromus. He demon∣strated
that the Pope was Antichrist, whom the Disciples of Christ ought in no wayes to follow. He wrote a Book De dignitate & potestate Ecclesiastica, in which book, he saith, That Subjects should be absolutely and simply bound to beleeve the Pope, is so ir∣rational and full of blasphemy, that it is found more pestilent then any heresie whatsoever. Being aged, upon a certain time when a young man called M. Joannes Ostendorpius, came to him, he said these words; Well my childe, thou shalt live to that day, when thou shalt see that the doctrine of these new and contentious Divines, as Thomas and Bonaventure, with others of the same sort, shall be utterly rejected and exploded from all true Christian Divines. And this which Ostendorpius then being young heard Weselus to speak, he repor∣ted himself to Noviomagus, which wrot this story, Anno 1520. and heard it of the mouth of the said Weselus, Anno 1490.

In which time (as he was pleased often to remember) he heard his Uncle the Abbot say,Sir George Pawle in his life That they, and their Religion could not long continue, because (said he) I have read the whole Scripture over and over, and could never finde therein, that our Religion was founded by God. And for proof of his opinion, the Abbot would alledge that saying of our Saviour Matth. 15.13. Every plant which my hea∣venly Father hath not planted. shall be rooted out. He never preached, but he first wrote his Notes in Latine, and afterward kept them during his Life. There were several writings between him and Thomas Cartwright about the Ceremonies.

John Hus was his Scholar, he brought his Books and Doctrine into Bohemia. He being the publick Reader in the University of Oxford, was for the rude time wherein he lived, famously reputed for a great Clerk, and expert in all kinde of Philosophy. He flourished about the year of our Lord 1371. Edward the third reigning in England. He was called Doctor Evangelicus. He was born in the North, and to this day some of his name and family do there yet remain, to whom I am allied. He was brought up in Merton Colledge in Oxford, and removed thence to Queens Colledge. He was beloved of all good men for his good life, and greatly admired of all his adversaries for his Learning and knowledge both in Divinity and humanity. He was Doctor in Divinity almost thirty years, and for some time Parson of Lutter∣worth in Leicestershire. See Camden there. Divers Works of his in written-hand remain in our Oxford-Library. He translated the whole Bible into English, with Prefaces and Arguments to every book. In his Trialogus. or Body of Divinity, l. 4. c. 7. he saith, Ido si centum essent Papae & omnes fratres essent versi in Cardinales, non deberet conceisententiae suae in materia fidei, nisi de quanto se fundaverit in Scriptura. He also saith, Papa est abominatio desolationis in abstracto. And Ch. 36. Olim Episcopi nostri di∣cuntur pseudofratres tanquam Diabolos odivisse, cum in tempore Domini Armachani, dicuntur ipsum in sumptibus contra hos pseudo ordines defendisse. Sed modo facti sunt amici Herodes & Pilatus, qui prius inter se fuerant inimici. There is also his Dialogus, and De Veritate Scripturae, and divers other Manu∣scripts of his well worthy the publishing. Yet he had his errours, lib. 2. of that Book, cap. 10. he saith, Angelos adoramus. See those Scriptures against that opinion, Deut. 4.19. & 17.3. Col. 2.18. Apoc. 9.10. & 20.8, 9. He grants Purgatory also l. 4. c. 22. of that book. Yet he was the first (saith Bale) who in that dark age brought truth to light, and was bold openly to confesse Christ before the whole Synagogue of Satan, and to reveal the filthinesse of the great Whore.

His right name was Preston, for Widdrington was a plain illiterate man. He and Blackwell took the Oath of Allegiance. He wrote to the Pope, and earnestly beg'd of him, that the Papists here might take that just Oath of Allegiance o the King, and refuted Bellarmine, who oppo∣sed it with strong reasons. This Oath (viz. of Allegiance) according to every part and parcel of the same may be lawfully taken by any Catholick, as have averred both M. Widdrington, Sir William Howard, and others. Widdrington in his New-years-gift, hath suffici∣ently proved, that besides the authority of many famous Divines, it was the opi∣nion of the chiefest secular Priests in England.

The sayings of the Scripture, with which he sustained himself against temptati∣ons on his death-bed, were these, Joh. 3.16. Mat. 11.29. 1 Joh. 1.7. The bloud of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. He left many Works which are mentioned by Melchior Adam. Andrew Willet. A laborious godly Divine. He printed thirty three Books.

Doctissimus ipse & erudi∣torum fautor egregius. In Italiam veni∣enti, nec opi∣nanti, de supe∣riore loco Caesareas institutiones interpretandi provincia à Patavinis demandatur. Hic praeclaros illos libros in X. Tit. qui de Testamentis Commentarios adornavit; sibique non tam popularis aurae captandae, quam bene de Re∣publica merendi studio passius est. Quo quidem libro. si molem spectes, in speciem fortasse exiguo; sin rerum utilitatem ponderumque momenta aestimes, diffusis aliorum voluminibus anteponendo Italiam qua pater, do∣ctrinae fama conurbavit, & praeclarum illud Alciati Elogium promeruit, Magnae spes altera Romae. Auberti Miraet Elogia Belgica. Vide Suffrid. Pet. De Scriptoribus Frisiae Decadem Duodecimam.Vigilius Zuichemus. He had all those accomplishments which are required in a compleat Professour of the Law, being very much versed in the Theory and practice of the Law. He had an exact knowledge of the Circle of the Arts, and of History, he had skill in the Greek, Latine, the Germane, French and Italian Tongues.

Melch. Ad. in ejus vita.Theodorus Zuingerus. His great Work, entitled Vita humanae theatrum, got him a great name. Basilius Amberbachius hearing of his death, broke out with sighs into these words, Piget me vivere post tantum virum: cujus magna fuit doctrina; sed exigua, si cum pietate conferatur. It irks me to live after so great a man, whose Learning was great, but small if it be compared with his piety. Many of his Works are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

Natione Hel∣vetius, vir verè pius & solide doctus, cum in omni literarum genere, tum in sacra hilosophia, & tribus linguis eruditissimis, Latina inquam, Graeca & Hebraica, atque in vernaculo, id est, Germanico sermone disertissimus, immortali laude apud omnem posteritatem dignus: quem adolescens olim Vetus Testamentum Latine Tiguri enarrantem, & in Ecclesiis Ger∣manice verbum Dei enucleantem, audivi: sed prob dolor nimium brevi tempore Gesn. Biblioth. Zuinglius etiam vir fortis alioquin & animosus, cum secum reputaret, quod si domi resideret, ac praeum fortè fieret adversum, fore, ut magnam ipse sustineret invidiam, quasi concionibus quidem accenderet hominum animos, in ipso autem dis∣crimine mollesceret, voluit omnino Communem subire mortem. In corpus autem examine adeo saevitum fuit, & vix etiam illius morte potuit odii cerbiras exaturari. Natus erat annos quadraginta quatuor, junior Luthero quatuor annis. Sleid. De Statu Relig. & Reipub. Comment. lib. 8. Repertus est multis vulneribus confectus Zuinglius, qui primus ad Helvetios attulit pestifera Lutheranorum dogmata: eisque ob singularem, qua maximè inter Helvetios florbat, opimonem virtutis, doctrinae & sapientiae, assidue imperitorum animos imbuebat: cog∣nitum postea est, pagum qui Tigutinus appellatur, quique omnium infidelium habetur caput, ex CCC.

Oecolamp. & Zuing. lib. 4. pag. 211.As Germany admired her Luther, so Helvetia her Zuinglius. He was skilfull in the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, though hard to be got at that time, using the best Professours; he had a great memory, being able to repeat Valerius Maximus and St Paul by heart, whose Epistles he had copied out. He frequently disputed with both Papists and Catabaptists, whereof Fran∣ciscus Lambertus then a minorite Fryer being one, was (as he thankfully ac∣knowledged) hereby reclaimed, and became afterwards a great Light in the Church. Stando confecit omnia sua studia, certas eis vendicans horas, quas etiam non omisit
nisi seriis coactus. A summo mane ad horam decimam lectioni, interpretationi,Osvaldus My∣conius De vita & obitu Zuin∣glii. Vide plura ibid. do∣ctrinae, scriptioni dabat operam, prout temporis & rerum postulabat ratio. Post pran∣dium audiebat vel narrantes, vel consilia rogitantes, aut confabulabatur, aut deam∣bulabat cum amicis, usque ad horam secundam, hinc etiam reditus ad labores. Post Coenam ubi paulisper deambulasset, fere literis scribendis vocabat, interdum ad mediam usque noctem nihil agens aliud. The Tigurius being compelled to warre against their enemies, Zuinglius was slain in the battel. It is the manner of Zurick, that when they go forth in warfare, the chief Mi∣nister of their Church goeth with them. Zuinglius also of himself being a man of a stout and bold courage, considering that if he should tarry at home, and they should go by the worse, what displeasure he should sustain, as one that in his Ser∣mons would encourage, and himself faint, when any danger was; would needs take such part as others. Sir Thomas More in his Preface to the Confutation of Tyndals Answer, hath this bitter passage, Zuinglius that first brought into Switzerland that abominable Heresie against the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, was by the hand of God this year slain in plain battel against the Catholiques, with many a thousand of his wretched Sect, being in number to the Catholiques three against one, and as proud∣ly, and with his malicious purpose invading them, as ever did the Egyptians pursue the children of Israel. His Works are published in four Tomes, mentioned by Boissard, After his body was cut first in four peeces, and then consumed with fire, three dayes after his death his friends came to see whether any part of him was remaining, where they found his heart in the ashes whole and unburned.
