HAving been heretofore informed, that thorow the immoderate taking of Tobacco, provoking the takers thereof to excessive Drinking and other inconveniences, the health of many of Our Subjects had been much impaired, which had the rather been oc∣casioned for that no restraint had been made of the number, nor regard had of the quality of those that sold Tobacco by Retail but persons of the meanest condition had promiscuously used to Retail the same, keeping no order or assize therein: Whereupon We out of Our Princely care, to represse all such excesses, and to prevent such future inconvenien∣ces as might occur thereby, did by the advice of the Lords and others of Our Privy Coun∣cell, resolve to regulate the ungoverned Selling and Retailing of Tobacco, and to reduce the same into some good order; and that none but men of sufficiency, and such as should bring certificate of their meetnesse, should from thenceforth be permitted to sell or utter Tobacco by Retail, and those onely in certain fit places, and to a certain number in every such place, which places and number We did by the like advice of the Lords, and others of Our Privie Coun∣cell, appoint accordingly: And afterwards by Our Proclamation, dated the thirteenth day of March, in the ninth yeer of Our Reign, for the reasons therein expressed We did straitly charge and command, that none should from thenceforth presume to sell or utter Tobacco by Retail, untill they should have obtained Our Licence in that behalf. In conformity whereunto, divers of Our loving Subjects have since taken severall and respective Licences under Our great Seal of England, to sell and utter forrain Tobacco by Retail, in such respective Cities, Towns, and places, as in the same Licences are expressed, rendring to Us, Our Heirs and Successors, such Rents as in and by Our said Licences are respectively reserved in that behalf: By which means not onely the afore mentioned excesses
have in some good measure been repressed, and many inconveniences prevented, but also some small addition and improvement hath been made to Our Revenue. But notwithstanding the Premisses, divers ill affected persons, endeavouring for some small advantage to themselves, to bring the Retailing of Tobacco to that confused and un∣governed liberty it had before, have in contempt of Our said Proclamation presumed with∣out Our Licence to vent and utter Tobacco by Retail, as well in London, and the parts ad∣jacent, as in divers other Cities, Towns, and places of this Our Realm, thereby discoura∣ging, and in some sort disabling Our said Subjects, who have taken Our Licences, as afore∣said, to pay their Rents thereon reserved, and likewise dis▪heartning others (that is to say) some from suing forth the Licences for which they have respectively contracted, others from contracting with Our Agents appointed in that behalf; and the better to colour their pra∣ctises, have spread abroad, especially within Our City of London, and the parts adjacent, false reports and rumours, as if We intended to desist from Our aforesaid course of reformation: which their practises and bold attempts We have just cause to take in ill part, and not to suffer the same to passe unpunished. Yet because some of Our Subjects, through the false reports and rumours so spread abroad, as aforesaid, may make some doubt of Our Royall intention in the Premisses, there∣fore We have thought meet hereby to declare and publish to all Our people, that We will not leave unfinished so great a work begun with such advice and care, and so much tending to their health and welfare, neither will We suffer Our Revenue in any part thereof by the wilfull opposition of some few refractory persons to be impaired. And therefore We do hereby straitly charge and command all Our loving Subjectts, that none of them do from henceforth presume directly or indirectly, to sell, utter, or deliver any Tobacco by Retail, in any place or places within Our said Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Barwick, or any of them, without Our speciall Licence under Our great Seal of England, to be obtained in that behalf. And We do likewise will and command all Pedlers who wander up and down, not ma∣king their constant abode in any one place, and all and every other Interloper or Interlo∣pers whatsoever, that none of them do from henceforth directly or indirectly, sell, utter, or deliver any Tobacco by Retail, or under colour or pretext of giving Tobacco, do by them∣selves, or any other, take or receive any recompence for the same. And whereas divers of Our Subjects, who are licensed to retail Tobacco in their own houses onely, do notwithstanding retail Tobacco in Fairs and Markets abroad, to the prejudice of such persons as are licensed to sell Tobacco in those places, Our will and plea∣sure is, and We do hereby straitly charge and command that from henceforth they and every of them do forbear to sell, utter, or deliver Tobacco by Retail, in any other places then ac∣cording to the purport and true meaning of their respective Licences under Our great Seal. And whereas We are informed that much English Tobacco, which through the cold∣nesse of the climate and unaptnesse of the soil not coming to perfect maturity, is altogether unwholsome to be taken, and other Tobacco adulterate and mixed with rotten fruits and other corrupt ingredients is dayly sold and uttered to Our people; We do hereby charge and
straitly command, that no person whatsoever within Our said Kingdom of England and Ireland, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Barwick, or any of them, do from henceforth pre∣sume to buy, sell, or utter, directly or indirectly, any Tobacco of the growth of Our King∣doms of England and Ireland, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Barwick, Islands of Jersey, Garn∣sey, and Man, or any of them, or any mixed or adulterate Tobacco whatsoever: And the better to prevent the great abuse offered and done to Our loving Subjects in the sale of Eng∣lish Tobacco, We do also straitly charge and command that no person whatsoever do at any time hereafter plant, or cause to be planted, any Tobacco within Our Kingdoms of England and Ireland, or either of them, or within Our Dominion of Wales, or Town of Barwick, or with∣in Our Islands of Jersey, Garnsey and Man, or any of them, and that all Tobacco already planted, and now growing there, be presently displanted and utterly destroyed. And to the end the doing hereof be not in any wise omitted or neglected, We do charge and command all Constables, Tithingmen, Headboroughs, and other Officers within their severall limits and jurisdictions, carefully to see the same executed accordingly. And further, We do will and command all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffs, and other principall Officers in their severall places, within the compasse of their severall ju∣risdictions and authorities, upon complaint to them made, to cause the same to be duly per∣formed without partiality, as they and every of them will answer their contempts at their perils. And We do further will and command, that no Tobacco whatsoever be from henceforth imported, landed, or unladed to, in, or at any other Port, Haven, Creek, or place within Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Port and Town of Barwick, or any of them, then to, in, or at Our Port of London, without speciall warrant to be obtained from Our Lord high Treasurer of England for the time being in that behalf: And that all Merchants, Masters, and Owners of any Ship or Ships, and other persons whatsoever within or under Our obedience, do take notice of Our Royall command and pleasure herein, and do carefully and duly observe the same accordingly. And We do hereby straitly charge and command all Our Subjects to yeeld their due obe∣dience in all and singular the Premisses, as they tender Our pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their perill. Given at Our Court at VVhitehall the five and twentieth day of March, in the fourteenth yeer of Our Reign. ❧God save the King. Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. 1638.
