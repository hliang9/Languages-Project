To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND TRULY VERTUOUS LADY, the LADY KATHARINE D'ARI, These following POEMS are by the AUTHOR, Humbly DEDICATED and PRESENTED.
TO The Reader. ANd now Reader I dare be bold to tell thee, that thou hast something of true worth and value within these leaves, since the foregoing Schedule hath acquainted thee with the name of a LADIE who is exempla∣rily eminent, in every reall perfecti∣on. It may bee thou wilt expect I should adde a word or two, as to the
contents of the Booke thou art about to looke into; and it shall bee onely this; That, I can assure thee, it will neither wound, nor defile the hand that takes it up.
CERTAINE Serious thoughts: Which at severall times and upon sundry occasions have stollen themselves into Verse, and now into the publike view. SOmetimes a well-aymd thought would point at Hea∣ven But O mine heart, That broken Bow, carrying the shaft on even Aside doth start: Lord! that I may not, from that mark decline Let my fraile Ew be back't with the true Vine,
And give me Arrows winged from above With the sure flying feathers of the Dove, Then guide my hand, and make me levell right And 'tis thy honour if I hit the White. On the 6. parts of Prayer. MY 1Supplications often have prevail'd, Nor have my 2Deprecations often fail'd; My 3Intercessions have been heard by thee; But Lord! 4Confession best-becommeth me; For all thy love; for giving and forgiving, Accept the Sacrifice of my 5Thanksgiving; Little I say by 6Imprecation, More, then, in all things, let Thy will be done.
Going to the Sacrament of the LORDS SUPPER. THou ever-blessed Saviour, at thy death By by-partite Indenture didst bequeath Thy body, bloud, and merits to each one Whose grace-instructed faith cal's them his own, Whose sin-avoyding Actions doe proclaim, Him an Adorer of thine holy Name. Till thou O Lord, or call, or come again, Let me not violate the Counter-pane, Goe with me, O my gracious God, and give Life to my Faith, that I by Faith may live. On a particular Occasion. ROuze thee my too forgetfull Muse; rehearse Th'Almightie's goodness in a thankfull verse,
He only shew'd thee trouble, sent reliefe When best-applyed means but added griefe, He to his servants prayer had regard, And turn'd his Chastisments to a reward. ANOTHER. SHall cunning Satan still defraud my soule And steale into my heart by gilded sins? He can make splendid, what is ne'r so foule; He knowes not how to end, who once begins To tast his sly deceits; beware, hee'l give thee Poyson in sweetned pills, and so deceive thee. Vpon PSALM 90. 10. First written upon a bare leafe in QUARLES His Poems, over-against his verses on Mors tua. GReat God! this death-beleaguerd Fort cal'd Man Though strongly back't by nature, seldom can
Out-last the seventeeth yeare; though thou afford To my sin-stained life that number, LORD The third part of them have already slip't Me too regard less; Satan still hath nipt Thy blooming crop, my weak resolves have bin Swift to dissolve into accustomd sin, O let th'uncertain remnant of my dayes Be dedicated to my Makers praise; O that this lump of dust knod-up in bloud, Would once leave trifles, and pursue what's good. Feare then I would not; though a voice should say, Thy glass is run, and thou must dye to day, For so from sin, and sorrow should I rest; And rise, not unto judgment, but a feast; That marriage-Supper, which, we read, of old Was by the Bridegroom, to the Iewes foretold: That marriage Supper, where to heavens King Blest soules eternall Alleluja's sing.
Vpon PSALM. 7. 12. 13, 14. God is a righteous Iudge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.If a man will not turne, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: hee ordaineth his Arrowes against the Perse∣cutors. HAst thou not heard O man, or canst forget This terrible Alarme, God will whet His sword, prepare his Arrows, and his bow; Doth not experience daily bid thee know That, when he will revoke thy borrowed breath A Fly or Gnat's an Instrument of death, Canst thou shake off those thoughts wch whisper to thee, This minut's sin for ever may undoe thee? Will not thy head-strong Will be curbed by The thought of fathomless Eternity? Or doth thy weak conceipt befoole thee so As once to think that God, though he be slow
To punish, see's not when thou goest astray, That thus thou dars't provoke him every day? If man return not dost thou say? is then The pow'r of turning in the choyse of men? My soul Lord know's it is not, yet I see By thy command, what I should beg of thee; Nor can I beg till thou my God prepare, My un-prepared heart and voyce to prayer. From my wast-field if any good proceed, Thou must be Author both of Will and Deed: Stub-up the thornes, un-pave the soyle and make The well-injected seed deep rooting take, Afford me fruitfull seasons that I may Bring some sheafs with me on my judgment day. Vpon MATTH. 10. 34. CAme then the God of peace to send the sword? Doth variance accompany his word:
Must all those sacred knots nature doth tye In Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters dye; Truth hath if selfe depos'd it, and I must Believ't how-ever strange, yet sure 'tis just. Nor doth Religion cancell or withstand, Or any way abbreviate that command: Whereby we duty-bound to Parents are, Nor Charity and love doth it impare, To other friends; what's theirs, to them impart We may, we must, and yet choose Mary's part: He, whose direction only point's-out Right The most disjoynted soules can re-unite, And so cement a friendship by his word Too strong to be dissolved by the sword. On a particular occasion. IN thee alone my wearied thoughts can find, Where to repose their doubts: my setled mind,
On thee secure depends, great God arise; Thy timely goodnesse to our wondring eyes May banish't joyes reduce, here fixed be My deaded hopes, and fetch new life from thee. Thy wonted mercies often shewn before, Imbolden my weak verse thus to implore Thy powerfull ayd, who, ever more then I By blest experience, could thy love discry? In trouble, sorrow, sicknesse, feare and griefe, My case, to thee commended, met reliefe. My sins though many, cancelled by thee Shall neither prejudice my suit, nor me. I will not doubt, my God I know can doe't My God I know can doe't, I will not doubt. A Domino factum est istud. Nor was there ever any had recourse To him by humble prayer that sped worse; For this, my heart within me shall rejoyce, In all distresses thou shalt heare my voyce; And if at any time, my suite ungranted, Return, I'le think 'tis better for me wanted.
To Master WROTH School-Master at EPPING in ESSEX. THose recollective Thoughts to me, Most welcome, SIR, must ever be; Which to my memory represent, The time, under your roofe I spent; Though spent improvidently, there Large fields of corne for reaping were: Yet I but glean'd, which make's my starved Muse Such leane, ill-thriven verses now produce. I might have learn't how to Decline All Vices; and Forme by Divine Sweet Conjugations, my Sence To due and fitting Mode and Tence: You th' Pronouns, mine and thine did teach To be no more but Parts of Speech; From you a Generall rule I might have got To use the world, as though I us'd it not. But Oh, how Zions plants would thrive and like, If it were fenced round with such a Dike
As he, whose pithy Sermons double were In number, to the Sabbaths in the yeare; Who, summon'd up to heaven, back hath sent His Posthume book t'attend the Sacrament. Nor is it from Ingratitude, that in The middle of my non-age I begin: Vnto his Care my childish yeares were given, Whose Cure now poynt's us out the way Heaven. Too few such men are found in any age As was the Guardian of my pupill-age; He scorn'd the common roade, did not discharg By some raw scarce-made Bachilor his charge. Lord I admire thy providence, and see How vast a summe I am in debt to thee, But nothing have to pay: if thou do'st call For an account, behold, forgive me all Is all I can produce; O cross the score, And make my love proportionably more. Scindimur incerti. CAn mans distracted fancy find the way To truth; where thousand sects themselves display
Supporting errour? This terrestriall round hath scarce a place where Veritie is found. ASIA. ASIA, which only, glories to have een A spotlesse man, where Canaan hath been A type of Heaven, and the blest abode Of the whole world's creator Iacob's God, Where all the sacred pen-men once did preach, Nay, where the Lord himself vouchsaf'd to teach, Wallow's in darknesse now their Sun is set, With bended knees they crouch to Mahomet; And in the stead of Sinai's Law-Divine, The Talmude is receiv'd in Palestine. AFRICA. THough Hippo's Sainted-Bishop Augustine Like a bright Lamp in Tunis once did shine; In Aegipt, by St Mark, although were sown The early seeds of true Religion, Though Aethiopia's Eunuch did proclaime The Lamb whom he mis-tooke till Phillip came; All's now erased, and a man may say Nothing but error spreads in Africa.
AMERICA. THis Spain-enriching new-found world, a gem Once proffer'd to our Henry's Diadem; With reverence to their puppet-zemes do pray, Whil'st to them they themselves become a prey. Those devill-spirits every where appeare, Not honour'd though ador'd, serv'd but for feare; And yet this now in-fatuated flock Shal know the Shepherds voyce and Bridgroom's knock: Their time of Gospell's next Religion may Still bending West find out America. EVROPE. NO harbour where my Sea-tost ship may lye, At Anchor, and expect felicity! So many lands run o're, and yet not see A path directing to Eternity! What hope remain's? in Europ, sure, he shall That fly's Charybdis into Scyll fall. Opinions here, as much as faces vary, Some this, some that, some think the quite contrary. Hence 'tis that every Nation may discover Her armed Natives murthering one another.
Wa'st not from hence the King of France thought good, To drench his Sisters Nuptials in bloud? Hence all the present forreign jarrs, and those Where Tweed her flowing streames doth interpose; And as asham'd to heare warrs threats again, Hastens to hide her face within the Maine. Poor Soul, thy wearied foot-steps may in vaine Survey the universe, return again As farre from satisfaction as before, Vnlesse divine direction thou implore; Lord teach my wary thoughts so to decline, All devious paths, as to keep close to thine. Vpon 1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid Iesus Christ. And if any man build on this foundation, gold, sil∣ver, precious stones, timber, hay stubble; Every mans work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire: and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is. If any mans work that he hath built upon abide, he shall receive wages.
If any mans work burn, he shall lose, but he shall be safe himselfe: neverthelesse, yet as it were by fire. THe heaven-instructed Master-builder layd Zions foundation, skilless men have reard Their own inventions: some have wooden made And saplesse doctrines, of small use when heard. Others their hay-like withering Sermons vent, No Scyth is sharper then their byting phrase; Most bring us stubble, when the corn is spent, And trifles prosecute with strained praise. All these are combustible; send that fire Thine holy Spirit, try, consume, refine, Thy Prophets so with sacred truths inspire That they may rectifie each crooked line. Vs hearers such affections affoord As fit's a spirituall building to thee Lord. Vpon Amos 1. 11. Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. IN sacred Scripture, I have sometimes read A sorer famine threatned then of bread.
That judgments fal'n on us. Where for a time I sojourn'd, West-ward in a Northern Clime, Two Counties, for the lack of Wine unable Were to invite us to the Holy Table; This question rose, amongst discourse, about it, May not the Sacrament be given without it? Some said it might, some that again deni'de, I dare not take upon me to decide, Nor unto other doe I ayme to give A Law: but for my own part thus conceive; So God vouchsafe my soules repast to mak't I care not though in Vinegar I tak't, FEB. 8. 1642. TIs not base trembling, cowardize and feare That mak's me in this fighting age, forbeare To draw my sword: but seem an uselesse thing Perhaps, whil'st others by adventuring Gaine glorious titles; for my Countries good My steps would fearlesse march in Seas of bloud, And welcome certaine ruine: yet I finde A war within my selfe, and stay behind.
Eternall blessings fasten on the Crown, To Charles his head; God grant him all his own: And may as long-liv'd curses fall upon Their heads who honour not his Princely Son, So from my heart I wish: and yet suspect Many unsound will sound that Dialect: The form-obtrudors may deform and make Eneruous (whilst the Church of Rome doth take Advantage, and supplant Religion) Il'e not thrust in my hand to help them on. Whose heart can lesse then bleed, whose head can be Lesse then a spring of teares, when his eyes see Distemper'd Zion, in this wofull plight, Her un with-drawn, inveloped with night? My willing Muse, so she were unperplext, Could wish to sing her Nunc-Dimittis next. Ho! all that love her, all that passe this way, Contribute here your sighs, sit down to pray And mourn, till God, all other hopes are vaine, Make up the breaches of his Church again. Amen, So be it. Lord say Amen, let it be so, that we The beauty of thine holinesse may see.
Vnum hoc, a te Domine, expetivi, usquè immo & us{que} Idem expetam: sacro-sanctae nempe ut aedis Tuae incola, populi tui laetitiâ fruar, Psallenti{que} Israeli comes adjungar. Si fractus elabatur Orbis Impavidum ferient ruinae: Though all the Elements, like us, should jar And wrap up ruin'd Nature by the war, Though the worn Fabrick of the sphears above Should, in disjoynted fragments, downward move, And horrid Catarackts should headlong come With swift descent, to make the world one tombe, Yet should my feareless soule hope to espie, A place of safety in my Saviour's eye. That skilfull chymist's never-failing art, Can good, extracted out of ill, impart, And ev'n by her distresses rear a frame, That Zions re-built glory may proclaime; Which, if my longing eyes but live to see, 'Tis Lord that one thing which I beg of thee.
Some foot-steps of this Warre traced. THe low-tun'd numbers of my humble Verse Cannot this Scene of death to th'life rehearse, I offer but one dish, and that I feare Will, Reader, worth thy tasting scarse appeare; Yet may prepare thy stomach, thou wilt be Hereafter feasted with the Historie; Some cunning hand will strike so high a string, That all the quarters of this Orb shall ring The great atchievements of our Nobles: they Shall live in numbers that are lap't in clay, And those that make Iambicks in their pace, Shall, in Heroicks, run with nimble grace. Here my ingaged thoughts, could I but frame A verse that worthy were to beare his name, Would vent themselves and tell thee who did come Though lame yet loaden with much honour home. At Worster, first the Tragedy begun; From worse to worse, since that, we head-long run: For follow South-ward, and discover still, The edge of War, but sharp'ned at Edg-hill:
Many tall Cedars fell, some shaken lye, Yet discord bloomes again since Newbery. Besides these three, how many Fields have been Forc't into blushing tinctures, from their Green By flowing bloud? This issue, though it be Not twelve yeares old, ô God by none but thee, Is curable, unless the selfe-same hand That heal'd that woman save this bleeding Land, We perish; all our thoughts amazed are, On thee our eyes are fix't, thy people spare. Sure some Prophetick spirit gave the name, Vnto that Village where, beside the Lame Four thousand Christians all bereav'd of breath By fire-enraged Messengers of death, The setting sunne beheld, and at the sight Hastned his Western journey, and sent night To force a truce: 'Tis call'd long-Mar-ston, yet Mars thy command I wish may soon be shortned in this Land. But can our wishes, which from flesh and bloud, And common-sence arise procure this good?
No, we have sinn'd, and each one must begin To be impartiall to his proper sin. O let us to the throne of Grace repaire With true-repentant, humbly-servent prayer, Presented in our Saviours Oratory, Then God will Finis write to this sad story. On the death of our Vertuous and deare friend Mistris Dorothy Warwick at Marsk, Aug. 6th 1644. IF only light griefs find a tongue; and those That are extream, cannot themselves disclose Immur'd by stupid silence, surely then Nothing but flowing teares must from my pen Be-blur this paper: 'tis beyond the art, Of language to expresse the smallest part Of our deep sorrowes for her losse, whose age Scarce to the Summer of her Pilgrimage Attayned had; yet so ripe fruit, but few After the Autumne of their yeares, can shew.
No act of hers could be esteemed lesse, Then one step forward to that place of blisse; Where now her faith is crowned, and we find Her sweet and pretious memory behinde. Mors Mea. My flitting Soule must leave her house of clay, The tim's not more uncertaine then the way And manner, whether my consumptive breath Shall leisurely-expiring creep to death, Or some more furious, hasty sicknesse have Commission to snatch me to my grave. Water may cause or th'torrid element, My dissolution by some accident. Ten thousand means and more doe this discry, That young, strong, healthfull, rich, and all may dye, Though I scape chance, and sickness, yet I must At length by age subdu'd crumble to dust. I dare not wish, nor were it fit, to be A carver for my selfe▪ my God, to thee My willing soule resign's her fate, what s'ere Thou layest on me, give me strength to beare.
Yet, if it stand with thy good pleasure, send Not suddaine death, nor sence-bereaved end. And if thou'st honor with white haires my dayes; O teach me how to spend them to thy praise, That when I shall forsake the sons of men, My better part may flye to thee, Amen. Mors Christi. Thou Son of God, descending from above Would'st manifest by that rare act thy love To poore lost mortalls; did'st vouchsafe to take A death-subjected nature for our sake; Nor did'st disdaine to have thy sacred face; Made by those stubborn Iewes, their spitting-place. Thou patient stood'st the object of their scorn, Deck't in a purple robe, and crown of thorn; And Millions of such troubles having past, A shamfull death thou underwent'st at last, All this for us and more; for even as we, Thou tempted wast, the cup was drunk by thee,
Which thy just-angry Father had prepar'd To ransome man by Sathan's art insnar'd. Mine heart to thee's too poor an offering, Who by once dying took'st away death's sting. Fraus Mundi. Fond man I why doth thy fancy doat upon Such nothings, as the world can call its own? Why should such Ignes fatui divert, Thy erring foot-steps, or mislead thy heart? Belike thy soule but little light injoy's, For darkness gives the being to such toyes. Grant thou hast honour, beauty, riches, pleasure, Delitious fare with heaped summes of treasure, All in superlatives; get one gem more, Or else the former makes thee but more poore: Nay thou must sell them all that one to buy, If thou do'st mean to gaine felicity.
Gloria Caeli. Stay, doe not black this Paper, for it is A better Emblem of the place of blisse Then my dull pen can draw; 'tis pure and white May serve to represent eternall light; Hath neither spot nor wrinckle, none of them May come within the new Ierusalem. But how should paper, or my lines, which are Composed both of ragges, such joyes declare As never eye, nor eare, nor heart, nor braine Of man within that small sphear could containe? Yet may thy humble contemplation Discern some glimpses by reflection: Read then the glory of thy great Creator In this large book the world, which is his Creature. If wandring there thou chauncest to espy An object that is glorious in thine eye, Be it those greater, or the lesser lights Innumerably sparkling in cleare nights;
Or the those-emulating Diamond That pretious issue of inriched ground, Doth from some costly root a flow'r arise, Whose various colours please thy gazing eyes. Do'st thou admire the structure of some face, Which seem's to have engrossed every grace, Hast thou observed all the excellence, Wherewith Gods bounty feast's each severall sence? Screw up thy meditation then, think, Lord If to earth on earth thou art pleas'd t'afford Such blessings, ô thrice happy sure they be Who sainted are in blest Eternity. Dolor Inferni. Let not thy over-curious appetite Thy puzled cogitations invite, To lose themselves in seeking hell, nor it Beyond the pillars of the holy-Writ,
Think to discover: looke not to advance, Where God nil ultra writ's, thine ignorance. But know that there doth nothing want which can Adde tortures to that miserable man, Who's thither cast for sinne; in that curst place Nature run's retrograde to her own pace; Fire administers no welcome light, But serv's in torment, and makes sad the night, The parched tongue for water call's, but that It's cooling faculty hath quite forgot, By gnashing teeth and trembling yet is show'n That Hell is not without a Frozen-Zone: Once sleeping-conscience, then shall in despight Awake, and make those sufferings exquisite. What Vulture-Thoughts shall gnaw for evermore That heart which proffer'd mercy scorn'd before? All objects, by the ever-weeping eye, Shall wound the Soul with curst Eternity.
Now blessed Lord, inflame my keen desire To seeke that narrow path, which from this fire May keep my steps secure: sure 'tis not that To which some fancies give a shorter date, No, purge me here, and make me leane upon That sure foundation, the true Corner-stone. FAITH. TVrn or'e the sacred leaves, th'Almighty hath By sweet gradations, open'd to thy Faith The word of promise, new-fal'n man hath got A new-found meanes, to spoyle the serpent's plot. For God hath said; The woman's seed shall give A wound unto thy head, that man may live. Thence, through sucessive generations, trace That more explayned Covenant of Grace: Till, (from the world's beginning slain) the Lambe Attended by a quire of Angels came, In his rich bosome, bringing plenteous store Of blessings, only pointed at before;
And then observe, what pretious legacies Thy bounteous Lord bequeath's thy soule, and dye's To give thee life from both the Testaments, And from the heaven-ordayned Sacraments, Suck ever-flowing comfort: for to thee As well, as any heretofore, agree The still effectuall promises, which stand Now proffer'd to thy Faiths applying hand. HOPE. BVilt-upon this foundation, 'tis the scope Of saving Faith's next coosen-german, Hope, With patient longings to expect that blisse Whereof, the former present earnest is. Faith (in some sort) already Christ injoy's; Hopes object are those consummated joyes. Fides intuetur verbum rei, spes autem rem verbi. CHARITY. ANd from the fruitfull teeming womb of Faith Each work of Charity beginning hath;
From these the happy evidence is had Which prove's them sons of God, whom faith hath made. What e're thy God or Neighbours good requires Must be the serious bent of thy desires. Else know that to those things which heavenly bee A mis-call'd Faith cannot entitle thee. How dare presumptous hast once think to make Christ, Saviour and not Lord: sit down and take A survey of thine heart; though nothing there Can justifie thee, yet unlesse thou beare The Image of thy God, and strive to frame Thy likened conversation to the same, Thou hast no part nor share in him who gave Himselfe to death, repentant man to save. Now blush you Rhemish factors who have lay'd Your envious heads together to upbray'd With liberty a doctrin which hath shown Far better, strickter precepts then your owne; Perhaps you pick halfe sentences, and thence Extract an unmeant Heresie and sence. A cloud of reverend witnesses I might Produce, which neither more nor lesse do write
As to this point (though not in rime) then lye Here recollected, for the readers eye. On GODS UBI QVITARY PRESENCE. NO gloomy shades, nor darkned face of night Can shrow'd a sinner, from the quick-ey'd sight Of all-discerning Heaven: God doth rule Beyond the controverted coasts of Thule. And his unbounded justice doth controle, The frozen vertices of either Pole. All inter-fluent seas, all Regions stand Subjected to the power of his command. Then let not fancy'd secrecy invite Thy deeds of darknesse to out-black the night, Nor though some forraine Clime thou wandrest in, Where no know'n face can argue thee of sin, Dare to let-loose thy rebell-soule, but know There is a God above, see's all below: Who shall hereafter be thy judge, and then Thy bare-fac'd crimes, unmask't before all men,
And Angells must appeare, nay more, the Devills Will aggravate, that prompted to, those evills. Decemb. 10. 1644. HOw many contradictions dayly come Born on the wings of lying same! by some We hear of Battailes, stratagems, and sleights Whil'st others make them victories, or flights. All various rumors struggle for beliefe Whil'st varying humours feed the present griefe. Once more, the hopefull tearmes of happy-peace Salute's our greedy eares: O, may it please The all-disposing power above, to frame Our fitted hearts, to entertaine the same. Going to Bed. THus, on a pale sheete, I extended, shall Become ere long a livelesse coarse, and all These too-much prized trifles, which retard My soule in her best flights, without regard
Or rellish, must be left: then, in my grave Where all things are forgotten, I shall have A coole and lonely lodging, by the earth Lock't-up from all this worlds mis-called mirth. If thou, O blest Creator, shalt restore The peace, ease, plenty we injoy'd before, Let not those over-valued blessings move Our earth-bred thoughts to sleight the things above▪ Her's no abiding City: but thy grace May make the house of death a resting place. Thou sacred Arbitrer of life and death, Who summon'st, at thy pleasure, vitall-breath, When in thy house, my elevated soule Should mount to thee, yet lingring-here, doth foule Her self with terrene fancies make mine eye Recall my thoughts, and preach mortality. There lyes those dear remembrancers, I have Two parents, and two children in one grave; In twice-two yeares, thy wisdome saw it best To call these two sweet couples to their rest;
And since so neer, on both sides, I have seen Thine arrowes to me, teach me how to weane From this distemper'd globe, my mis-plac'd love And fix it firmly on the things above. Then if't shall please thee next to call on mee, I'le boldly leave this clay, and come to thee. May 10. 1645. Hearing the Birds sing after the departure of our deare MOTHER. ANd can you sing poor birds? do you not see A mourning countenance on every tree? Doth not each stone in this sad fabrick, tell What sable thoughts within these walls do dwell? Since she who added sweetnesse to the spring, To Summer glory, she whose care did bring More fruit then Autumne, and from whom it was That Icy-Winter undiscern'd did passe, Hath left these habitations, my-thinks you Should leave henceforth your warbling sonnets too,
Yet sing, but change your note and joyne with me, Tune your loud whistles to an Elegie. IUNE 8. 1645. MVst then the fate of York-shire, and the North Be try'd once more by dint of sword, step-forth Thou God of Battle, let the people see By the successe, which side is own'd by thee. —Sub amici fallere nomen Tuta frequensque via est— EAsie and undiscerned is the guile Which brings on mischiefe usher'd by a smile. Thus many who arride the Common-weale With joynt-pretences but disjoyn'd designe, Their own with publique interests intwine The better, and more covertly to steale Advantage to a party, putting on A forme of Paralell-expression, Faced with Good and Safety; yet extend
Their actions and endeavours to the end Of time, they'l never meet, but hold a course In lasting distance still, from ill to worse▪ Hei mihi! qnas urbes, & quanto tempore Martis Ignaras, uno rapuerunt praelia cursit? Claudiani carmen. Dum procerum mentes privata ad commoda torsae In commune vetant socias extendere dextr'as Buchanani carmen.
