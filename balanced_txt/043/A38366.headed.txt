ENGLAND AND SCOTLANDS COVENANT With their GOD; VIZ. In The Protestation, The Vow and Covenant, The Solemn League and Covenant, and an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Par∣liament, for the taking the same; together with an Exhortation made by the Assembly of DIVINES. An Ordinance for the better Observa∣tion of the Lords-Day. An Ordinance, together with an Order, for the strict keeping the Monthly fast. ORdered by the Commons in Parlia∣ment, That these Covenants and Ordi∣nances, be forthwith printed and published. Printed for Edw. Husband, Printer to the Honorable House of Commons. 1645.
Die Mercurii, 5. Maii, 1641. IT is this day Ordered by the House of Commons now Assembled in Parliament, That the Preamble, together with the Protestation which the Members of this House made the third day of May, shall be forthwith Printed, and the Copies Printed brought to the Clerk of the said House to attest under his hand, to the end, that the Knights, Citizens, and But∣gesses may send them down to the Sheriffs and Iustices of Peace of the severall Shires, and to the Citizens and Burgesses of the severall Cities, Boroughs and Cinque Ports respe∣ctively; And the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, are to intimate unto the Shires, Cities, Boroughs and Cinque Ports, with that willingnesse all the Members of this House made this Protestation: And further to signifie, that as they justifie the taking of it in themselves, so they cannot but approve it in all such as shall take it.
VVE the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in the Com∣mons House of Parliament, finding to the great grief of our hearts, that the Designes of the Priests and Iesuites, and other adhe∣rents to the See of Rome, have of late been more boldly and frequently put in practice then formerly, to the un∣dermining and danger of the ruine of the true Reformed Protestant Religi∣on in His Majesties Dominions esta∣blished: And finding also that there have been, and having just cause to suspect that there still are, even during the sitting in Parliament, endeavours to subvert the Fundamentall Laws of England and Ireland, and to introduce the exercise of an Arbitrary and Ty∣rannicall Government, by most per∣nicious and wicked Counsels, Practi∣ces, Plots, and Conspiracies: And that the long intermission, and unhap∣py breach of Parliaments, hath occa∣sioned many Illegall Taxations, whereupon the Subject hath been pro∣secuted and grieved: And that divers
Innovations and Superstitions have been brought into the Church, multi∣tudes driven out of His Majesties Dominions; jealousies raised and somented betwixt the King and His People; a Popish Army levied in Ire∣land, and two Armies brought into the bowels of this Kingdom, to the hazard of His Majesties Royall Person, the consumption of the Revenues of the Crown & Treasure of this Kingdom: And lastly, finding great cause of jea∣lousie, that endeavours have been, and are used to bring the English Army into a misunderstanding of this Parli∣ament, thereby to incline that Army, with force to bring to passe those wic∣ked councels, Have therefore thought good to joyn themselves in a Declara∣tion of our united Affections and Re∣solutions, and to make this ensuing Protestation. I A. B. do in the presence of Al∣mighty God, Promise, Vow, and Protest, to maintain and defend, as far as lawfully I may, with my life, power, and estate, the true Reformed Pro∣testant
Religion, expressed in the Do∣ctrine of the Church of England, a∣gainst all Popery and Popish Innova∣tions within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine, and according to the duty of my Alleagiance, His Ma∣jesties Royall person, Honour and Estate; as also the Power and Privi∣ledges of Parliament; The lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and every person that maketh this Protestation, in whatsoever he shall do in the lawfull pursuance of the same. And to my power, and as far as lawfully I may, I will oppose, and by all good wayes and means endeavour to bring to condigne punishment, all such as shall either by Force, Practise, Councels, Plots, Conspiracies, or o∣therwise, do any thing to the contrary of any thing in this present Protesta∣tion contained. And further, That I shall in all just and Honorable wayes endeavour to preserve the Vnion and Peace, between the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; And neither for hope, fear, nor other respect, shall relinquish this Promise, Vow, and Protestation.
VVHereas some doubts have been raised by severall persons out of this House, concerning the meaning of these words contained in the Prote∣station lately made by the Members of this House, Viz. The true Reformed Protestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England, against all Popery and Popish innovations within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine; This House doth Declare That by those words, was, and is meant, onely the publike Doctrine professed in the said Church, so far as it is opposite to Popery and Popish Innovations; And that the said words are not to be extended to the maintai∣ning of any Form of Worship, Disci∣pline, or Government, nor of any Rites or Ceremonies of the said Church of England.
Die Veneris, 30. Iulii, 1641. Resolved upon the Question, THat this House doth conceive that the Protestation made by them, is fit to be taken by every person that is well-affected in Religion, and to the good of the Common wealth; And therefore doth declare, That what person soever shall not take the Prote∣station, is unfit to bear Office in the Church or Common-wealth. The Vow and Covenant ap∣pointed by the Lords and Com∣mons assembled in Parliament, to be taken by every Man, in the Cities of London, Westminster, the Suburbs and Liberties thereof; and throughout the whole Kingdom. VVHereas the Lords and Com∣mons now astembled in Parlia∣ment have declared, That there hath
been, and now is a Popish and Trai∣terous Plot for the subversion of the true Protestant Reformed Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject; and that in pursuance thereof, a Popish Army hath been raised, and now is on foot in divers parts of this Kingdom: And have further in a solemn manner Declared, Vowed, and Covenanted, That in order to the security and pre∣servation of the true Protestant Re∣ligion, and Liberty of the Subject, they will not consent to the laying down of Arms, so long as the Papists now in open War against the Parlia∣ment, shall by force of Arms be pro∣tected from the Justice thereof. And whereas the Lords and Commons have Declared, That there hath been a treacherous and horrid Design lately discovered, by the great blessing, and speciall Providence of God, of divers persons to joyn themselves with the Armies raised by the King, and to de∣stroy the Forces raised by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, to sur∣prise the Cities of London and West∣minster, with the Suburbs, and by
Arms to force the Parliament: And the said Lords and Commons finding by constant experience, that many wayes of force and treachery are con∣tinually attempted, to bring to utter ruine and destruction the Parliament and Kingdom, and that which is dear∣est, the true Protestant Religion: And that for the preventing, and withstan∣ding the same, they have thought fit, That all who are true hearted, and lovers of their Countrey, should binde themselves each to other in a sacred Vow and Covenant, in manner and form as followeth, and accordingly: I A. B. in humility and reverence of the Divine Majesty, declare my hear∣ty sorrow for my own sins, and the sins of this Nation, which have de∣served the Calamities and Iudgements that now lie upon it; And my true in∣tention is, by Gods grace to endeavor the amendment of my own wayes; And that I do abhor and detest the said wicked and treacherous Design lately discovered; And that I never gave nor will give my assent to the
execution thereof, but will according to my power and Vocation, oppose and resist the same, and all other of the like nature: And in case any other like Design shall hereafter come to my knowledge, I will make such timely discovery as I shall conceive may best conduce to the preventing thereof. And whereas I do in my conscience beleeve, That the Forces Raised by the two Houses of Parliament are raised and continued for their just De∣fence, and for the Defence of the true Protestant Religion and Liberties of the Subject, against the Forces raised by the King: I do here in the pre∣sence of Almighty God, Declare, Vow, and Covenant, That I will, according to my power and vocation, assist the Forces raised and continued by both Houses of Parliament, a∣gainst the Forces raised by the King without their consent; and will like∣wise assist all other persons that shall take this Oath, in what they shall do in pursuance thereof; And will not directly or indirectly adhere unto, nor shall willingly assist the Forces
raised by the King without the con∣sent of both Houses of Parliament. And this Vow and Covenant I make in the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as I shall answer at the great Day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be dis∣closed.
COme, let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant, that shall not be forgotten, Iere. 50. 5. Take away the wicked from before the King, and his Throne shall be established in righteous∣nesse, Prov. 25. 5. And all Judah re∣joyced at the Oath, for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of them; and the Lord gave them rest round about, 2 Chron. 15. 15. The excellent Usefulnesse of this COVENANT. VNion with God, Conformity to God, and Vnity of the three Kingdoms, are things most desireable: In the first we are happy: In the second holy: In the third is strength, peace and safety. These are the kindly fruits of this Covenant, and a Covenant that brings forth these, how gladly should it be
embraced, and how willingly received? They are lovely Bands that binde us to be happy, holy, and safe. The heart of man is backsliding, and a Covenant is like a hedge or wall to stop us from going back: it being a good and ready answer to a tempter or tentation: How shall I do this, and break my Cove∣nant? Surely we have been too loose toward God, having almost lost a Re∣ligion, too loose in our lives, and too dis-united among our selves: and well it may be thought, that a main end of this Rod which now lyes upon us, is to beat us into this Covenant; that thereby we may be knit faster to God, to holinesse, and each to other by this Band of Vnity. Yet the taking, is not the chief part of a Covenant, but the keeping. The benefits of a Covenant are then sure and stedfast to us, when we are stedfast in the Covenant: Now a main cause of unstedfastnesse in the Covenant, is forgetfulnesse of it. To prevent this, the Covenant is present∣ed in this form that being set up before us, it may be daily seen, and by seeing remembred, and by remembring per∣formed:
And withall let us remember this; that all the wayes of God are mercy and truth to them that fear him and keep his Covenant. But because no man is strong in his own strength, let us seek strength of Him who is both our strength and our Redeemer, that by Him we may be enabled to keep our Covenant with him, that so he may delight to dwell with us, to be called our God, and to call us his peo∣ple; upon which happy condition, at∣tend Peace, Prosperity, and all blessings of Heaven and Earth, temporall and eternall. VVEE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, by the Providence of God, living under one King, and being of one Reformed Religion, having before our eyes the glory of God, and the ad∣vancement of the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the honour and happinesse of the Kings Majesty, and His Posterity, and the true publique Liherty,
Safety and Peace of the Kingdoms, where∣in every ones private condition is inclu∣ded; and calling to minde the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies, attempts, and practices of the Enemies of God, a∣gainst the true Religion, and professours thereof in all places, especially in these three Kingdoms ever since the Reforma∣tion of Religion, and how much their rage, power and presumption, are of late, and at this time increased and exercised; where∣of the deplorable estate of the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and Kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and Kingdom of Scotland, are present, & pub∣like Testimonies; we have now at last, (af∣ter other means of Supplication, Remon∣strance, Protestations, and Sufferings) for the preservation of our selves & our Reli∣gion, from utter ruine and Destruction, according to the commendable practice of these Kingdoms in former times, and the Example of Gods people in other Nations; after mature deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutuall and So∣lemne League and Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for him∣self,
with our hands lifted up to the most high God, do Swear: I. THat we shall sincerely, really & constantly, through the Grace of God, indeavor in our seve∣rall places & callings, the preservation of the reformed religion in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Di∣scipline and Government, against our common Enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, accor∣ding to the Word of God, and the Ex∣ample of the best Reformed Churches; And shall indeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three King∣doms, to the nearest Conjunction and Vniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, form of Church government, Directory for Worship and Catechi∣zing: That we and our Posterity after us, may as Brethren, live in Faith and Love, and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us. II. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, indeavour
the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, (that is, Church-government, by Arch Bishops, Bishops, their Chauncellors and Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-Deacons, and all other Ecclesiasticall Officers depending on that Hierarchie) Superstition, Heresie, Schism, Prophanenesse, and whatsoever shall be found to be contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godli∣nesse; lest we partake in other mens sins, and thereby be in danger to re∣ceive of their plagues, and that the Lord may be one, and his Name one in the three Kingdoms. III. We shall with the same since∣rity, reality, and constancy, in our se∣verall Vocations, endeavour with our Estates and Lives, murually to pre∣serve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the Kingdoms, and to preserve and de∣fend the Kings Majesties person and Authority, in the preservation and de∣fence of the true Religion, and Liber∣ties of the Kingdoms, that the world may bear witnesse with our conscien∣ces of our loyalty, and that we have no
thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesties just power and Greatnesse. IV. We shall also with all faith∣fulnesse endeavour the discovery of all such as have been, or shall be Incendi∣aries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by hindring the Reformation of Re∣ligion, dividing the King from his People, or one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any Faction or parties amongst the people, contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may be brought to publique triall, and receive condigne punishment, as the degree of their offences shall require or deserve, or the Supream Iudicatories of both Kingdoms respectively, or others, having power from them for that effect, shall judge convenient. V. And whereas the happinesse of a blessed Peace between these King∣doms, denied in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Provi∣dence of God, granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded and settled by both Parliaments, we shall each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavour that they may re∣main
conjoyned in a firm Peace and Vnion to all Posterity; And that Iu∣stice may be done upon the wilfull Opposers thereof, in manner expressed in the present Articles. VI. We shall also, according to our places and callings, in this Common Cause of Religion, Liberty and Peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof, and shall not suffer our selves, directly or indirectly, by whatsoever combination, perswasion or terror, to be divided, and withdrawn from this blessed Vnion and Conjun∣ction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or give our selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this Cause, which so much concern∣eth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdoms, and Honour of the King; but shall all the dayes of our lives, zealously and constantly continue therein against all opposition, and promote the same according to our power, against all Lets and Impedi∣ments whatsoever; and what we are
not able our selves to suppresse or o∣vercome, we shall reveale and make known, that it may be timely prevent∣ed or removed; All which we shall do as in the sight of God. And because these Kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against God and his Son Iesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present di∣stresses and dangers, the fruits thereof: We professe and declare before God and the world our unfained desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these Kingdoms, especially, that we have not as we ought, valued the inestimable benefit of the Gospel, that we have not laboured for the pu∣rity & power thereof, and that we have not indeavoured to receive Christ in our hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives, which are the causes of o∣ther sins and transgressions, so much abounding amongst us; And our true and unfeigned purpose, desire & indea∣vour for our selves & all others under our power & charge, both in publique and in private, in all duties we owe to God and man, to amend our lives, and
each one to go before another in the example of a reall Reformation, that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavy indignation, and establish these Churches and Kingdoms in truth and peace. And this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty God, the searcher of all hearts, with a true inten∣tion to perform the same, as we shall answer at that great Day, when the se∣crets of all hearts shall be disclosed, Most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to blesse our desires and proceedings with such successe, as may be deliverance and safety to his people, and incouragement to other Christian Churches, groaning under, or in dan∣ger of the yoak of Antichristian tyran∣ny; to joyn in the same, or like Associ∣ation and Covenant, to the glory of God, the inlargement of the Kingdom of Iesus Christ, and the Peace and Tranquility of Christian Kingdoms and Common wealths.
An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons As∣sembled in Parliament; With Instructions for the taking of the League and Covenant in the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales. VVHereas a Covenant for the preservation and Refor∣mation of Religion, The maintenance and defence of Laws and Liberties, hath been thought a fit and excellent meanes to acquire the fa∣vour of Almighty God towards the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and likewise to Vnite them, and by uniting, to strengthen and fortifie them against the Common-Enemy of the true Reformed Religi∣on,
peace, and prosperity of these Kingdoms; And whereas both Houses of Parliament in England, the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Kingdom of Scotland have already taken the same; It is now Ordered and Ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That the same Covenant be solemnly taken in all places throughout the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales. And for the better and more orderly taking thereof, these directions ensu∣ing, are appointed and enjoined strict∣ly to be followed,
Instructions for the taking of the Solemne League and Co∣venant throughout the King∣dome. I. THat the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament do speedily send (to the Lord Generall, and all other Commanders in chief, and Gover∣nours of Townes, Forts, Castles, and Garrisons, as also to the Earl of Warwick Lord High Admirall of Eng∣land) true Copies of the Solemne League and Covenant, to the end it may be taken by all Officers and soul∣diers under their severall Commands. II. That all the Knights and Bur∣gesses now in Parliament, do take spe∣ciall care speedily to send down into their severall Counties (which are or shall hereafter be under the power of the Parliament) a competent number of true Copies of the said League and Covenant, unto the Committees of Parliament in their severall Counties; And that the said Committees do
within six dayes at the most disperse the said Copies to every parish church or Chappel in the severall Counties, to be delivered unto the Ministers, Church-wardens, or Constables of the severall Parishes. III. That the said Committees be required to return a certificate of the day when they received the said co∣pies, as also the day they sent them forth, and to what Parishes they have sent them, which certificate they are to return to the Clerk of the Parlia∣ment, appointed for the Commons House, that so an accompt may be given of it, as there shall be occasion. IV. That the severall Ministers be required to read the said Covenant publikely unto their people the next Lords day after they receive it, and prepare their people for it, against the time that they shalbe called to take it. V. That the said League and Cove∣nant be taken by the Committees of Parliament in the place where they re∣side, and tendred also to the Inhabi∣tants of the Town, within seven daies after it comes to the said Committees hands.
VI. That the said Committees, af∣ter they have taken it themselves, do speedily disperse themselves through the said counties, so as three or four of them be together on dayes appoin∣ted at the chief places of meeting for the severall divisions of the said coun∣ties; And summon all the Ministers, Church wardens, Constables, and o∣ther Officers unto that place; where, af∣ter a Sermon preached by one appoin∣ted by the Committee for that pur∣pose, they cause the same Minister to tender the League and Covenant unto all such Ministers and other Officers, to be taken and subscribed by them, in the presence of the said Committees. VII. That the said Committees do withall give the said Ministers in Charge to tender it unto all the rest of their Parishioners the next Lords Day, making then unto their said Parishioners some solemn exhor∣tation concerning the taking and ob∣serving therof; and that the said Com∣mittees do also return to the severall Parishes, the names of all such as have taken the Covenant before them, who
yet shall also subscribe their names in the Book or Roll with their neighbors in their severall Parishes: And if any Minister refuse or neglect to appear at the said summons, or refuse to take the said Covenant before the Committee, or to tender it to his Parish, that then the Committees be carefull to appoint another Minister to do it in his place. VIII. That the League and Co∣venant be tendred to all men, within the severall Parishes, above the age of eighteen as wel lodgers as inhabitants. IX. That it be recommended to the earl of Manchester, to take speciall care that it be tendered and taken in the Vniversity of Cambridge. X. That for the better incourage∣ment of all sorts of Persons to take it; It be recommended to the assembly of Divines to make a brief Declaration, by way of Exhortation, to all sorts of Persons to take it as that which they judge not only lawfull, But, (all things considered) exceeding expedient and necessary, for all that wish well to Re∣ligion, the King and Kingdom to joyn in, and to be a singular pledge of
Gods gracious goodnesse to all the three Kingdoms. XI. That if any Minister do refuse to take, or to tender the Covenant, or any other person or persons do not take it the Lords day that it is tendred, that then it be tendred to them again the Lords day following, and if they still continue to refuse it, that then their names be returned by the Minister that tenders it, and by the Church-wardens, or Constables unto the Com∣mittees, and by them to the House of Commons, that such further course may be taken with them, as the Houses of Parliament shall see cause. XII. That all such persons as are within the severall Parishes, when no∣tice is given of the taking of it, and do absent themselves from the Church at the time of taking it, and come not in afterwards to the Minister & Church-wardens, or other Officers to take it in their presence before the return be made, be returned as refusers. The manner of the taking it to be thus: The Minister to read the whole Covenant distinctly and audibly in the
Pulpit, and during the time of reading thereof, the whole Congregation to be un∣covered, and at the end of his reading thereof, all to take it standing, lifting up their Right hands bare, and then after∣wards to subscribe it severally by writing their names (or their marks, to which their names are to be added) in a parchment Roll, or a Bock, wherein to the Covenant is to be inserted, purposely provided for that end, and kept as a Record in the Parish. XIIII. That the Assembly of Di∣vines do prepare an Exhortation for the better taking of the Covenant: And that the said Exhortation and the De∣claration of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, joyned in the Armies, for the vindication and defence of their Religion, Liberties and Lawes, a∣gainst the Popish Prelaticall and Ma∣lignant party, and passed the 30. of Ian. last, be publikely read, when the Co∣venant is read, according to the fourth and sixth Articles: And that a suffici∣ent number of Copies of the said De∣claration be sent by the persons ap∣pointed to send the true Copies of the said Covenant, in the first and second Articles. FINIS.
An Exhortation to the taking of the Solemn League and Co∣venant, for Reformation and Defence of Religion, the Ho∣nour and happinesse of the King, and the Peace and safe∣ty of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ire∣land. IF the power of Religion, or solid Reason, if Loyalty to the King, and piety to their native Countrey, or love to themselves, and naturall affection to their posterity, if the Ex∣ample of men touched with a deep sense of all these, or Extraordinary successe from God thereupon, can a∣waken an embroyled bleeding rem∣nant to imbrace the soveraigne and onely means of their recovery there can be no doubt but this Solemn
League and Covenant wil find where∣soever it shall be tendred, a people ready to entertain it with all cheerful∣nesse and duty. And were it not commended to the Kingdom by the concurrent encou∣ragement of the Honourable Hou∣ses of Parliament, the Assembly of Divines, the renowned City of Lon∣don, multitudes of other persons of e∣minent rank and quality in this Na∣tion, and the whole Body of Scotland, who have all willingly sworn and sub∣scribed it, with rejoycing at the Oath, so graciously seconded from Heaven already, by blasting the Counsels, and breaking the power of the Enemy more than ever; yet it goeth forth in its own strength, with such convincing evidence of Equity, Truth and Righ¦teousnesse,  may raise in all (not wilfully ignorant, or miserably sedu∣ced) inflamed affections to joyn with their Brethren in this happy Bond, for putting an end to the pre∣sent miseries, and for saving both of King and Kingdom from utter ruine, now so strongly and openly laboured
by the Popish faction, and such as have been bewitched and besotted by that viperous and bloody generation. For what is there almost in this Covenant, which was not for substance either expressed or manifestly inclu∣ded in that solemn Protestation of May 5. 1641. wherein the whole Kingdom stands ingaged untill this day? The sinfull neglect whereof, doth (as we may justly fear) open one floodgage the more to let in all these calamities upon the Kingdom, and cast upon it a necessity of renewing Covenant, and of entring into this. If it be said, the extirpation of Pre∣lacy, to wit, the whole Hierarchicall Government (standing, as yet, by the known Laws of the Kingdom) is new, and unwarrantable: This will appear to all impartiall understand∣ings, (though new) to be not onely warrantable, but necessary; if they consider (to omit what some say, that this Government was never formally Established by any Laws of this Kingdom, at all) that the very life and soul thereof is already taken from it,
by an Act passed this present Parlia∣ment, so as (like Jezabels Carcasse, of which no more was left but the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands) nothing of jurisdiction remains but what is precarious in them, and vo∣luntary in those who submit unto them: that their whole Govern∣ment is at best but a humane consti∣tion, and such as is found and ad∣judged by both Houses of Parliament, (in which, the judgement of the whole Kingdome is involved and declared) not onely very prejudiciall to the Civill State, but a great hinde∣rance also to the perfect Reformation of Religion; Yea, who knoweth it not to be too much an enemy thereunto, and destructive to the power of God∣linesse, and pure administration of the Ordinances of Christ? which moved the well-affected, almost throughout this Kingdom, long since to Petition this Parliament (as hath been de∣sired before, even in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth and of King James) for a totall abolition of the same: Nor is any man hereby bound to offer
any violence to their persons, but one∣ly, in his place and calling, to end ea∣vour their extirpation in a lawfull way. And as for those Clergy-men, who pretend that they (above all other) cannot Covenant to extirpate that Go∣vernment, because they have (as they say) taken a solemn Oath to obey the Bishops, in licitis & honestis: They can tell, if they please, that they that have sworn obedience to the Laws of the Land, are not thereby prohibited from indeavouring by all Lawfull means, the abolition of those Laws, when they prove inconvenient or mischievous. And if yet there should any Oath be found, into which any Ministers or others have entred, not warranted by the Laws of God and the Land, in this case, they must teach themselves and others, that such Oaths call for repentance, not pertinacy in them. If it be pleaded that this Covenant crosseth the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; there can be nothing further from truth: for, this Covenant
bindes all, and more strongly engageth them to preserve and defend the Kings Majesties Person, and Authority, in the preservation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the King∣doms. That scruple, that this is done with∣out the Kings consent, will soon be removed, if it be remembred, that the Protestation of the fifth of May before mentioned, was in the same manner voted and executed by both Houses, and after (by order of one House alone) sent abroad to all the King∣dom, His Majesty not excepting against it, or giving any stop to the taking of it, albeit he was then Resi∣dent in Person at White-hall. Thus Ezra and Nehemiah drew all the people into a Covenant, without any speciall Commission from the Persian Monarchs (then their Sove∣raigns) so to do, albeit they were not free Subjects, but Vassals, and one of them the meniall Servant of Artax∣erxes, then by Conquest King of Judah also. Nor hath this doctrine or practise
been deemed seditious or warrant∣able by the Princes that have sate upon the English Throne, but justified and defended by Queen Elizabeth of bles∣sed memory, with the expence of much Treasure and Noble blood, in the united Provinces of the Nether∣lands, combined not onely without, but against the unjust violence of Philip of Spain; King James follow∣ed her steps, so far as to approve their union, and to enter into League with them as free States; which is con∣tinued by His Majesty now reigning, unto this day; who both by his ex∣pedition for relief of Rochell in France, and his strict confederacy with the Prince of Orange, and the States Generall, notwithstanding all the importunity of Spain to the con∣trary, hath set to his Seal, that all that had been done by His Royall Ancestors, in maintenance of those who had so engaged and combined themselves, was just and warran∣table. And what had become of the Re∣ligion, Laws, and Liberties, of our
Sister Nation of Scotland, had they not entred into such a solemn League and Covenant at the beginning of the late troubles there; which course, however it was at first, by the Popish and Prelatick Projectors, represented to His Majesty as an offence of the highest nature, justly deserving cha∣stisement by the fury of a puissant Army; yet when the matter came afterwards in cool blood to be debated, first by Commissioners of both King∣doms, and then in open Parliament here, (when all those of either House, who are now engaged at Oxford, were present in Parliament, and gave their Votes therein) it was found, adjudged and declared by the King in Parlia∣ment, That our dear Brethren of Scot∣land had done nothing, but what be∣came Loyall and obedient Subjects, and were thereupon by Act of Parlia∣ment, publikely righted in all the Churches of this Kingdom, where they had been defamed. Therefore however some men, hoodwinkt and blinded, by the Arti∣fices of those Iesuiticall Engineers,
who have long conspired to sacrifice our Religion to the Idolatry of Rome, our Laws, Liberties, and persons to Arbitrary stavery, and our Estates to their insatiable Avarice, may possibly be deterred and amused with high Threats and Declarations, flying up and down on the wings of the Royall Name and Countenance (now cap∣tivated and prostituted to serve all their lusts) to Proclaim all Rebels and Traytors, who take this Cove∣nant; yet let no faithfull English heart be afraid to joyn with our Bre∣thren of all the three Kingdoms in this Solemn League, as sometimes the men of Israel (although under ano∣ther King, did with the men of Judah) at the invitation of Hezekiah, 2 Chron. 30. What though those tongues set on fire by Hell do rail and threaten? That God who was pleased to clear up the innocency of Mordecai and the Iews against all the malicious asper∣sions of wicked Haman to his and their Soveraign, so as all his plotting produced but this effect, That when
the Kings commandment and decree drew neer to be put in execution, and the ene∣mies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to the contrary, and the Jews had rule over them that hated them, and laid hands on such as sought their hurt, so as no man could with∣stand them, Esth. 9. and that same God, who but even as yesterday, vouch∣safed to disperse and scatter those dark clouds and fogs which overshadowed that Loyall and Religious Kingdom of Scotland, and to make their righ∣teousnesse to shine as clear as the Sun at noon day, in the very eyes of their greatest enemies, will doubtlessely stand by all those who with single∣nesse of heart, and a due sense of their own sins, and a necessity of Refor∣mation, shall now enter into an ever∣lasting Covenant with the Lord, never to be forgotten, to put an end to all those unhappy and unnatural breaches between the King, and such as are faithfull in the Land; causing their righteousnesse and praise to spring forth before all the Nations, to the terrour and confusion of those men of blood,
the confederate enemies of God and the King, who have long combined, and have now raked together the dregs and scum of many Kingdoms, to bury all the glory, honour and liberty of this Nation, in the eternall Grave of dishonour and destruction.

An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parli∣ament, for the better Observa∣tion of the LORDS-DAY. FOrasmuch as the Lords day, not∣withstanding severall good Laws heretofore made, hath been not only greatly prophaned, but divers un∣godly Books have been published by the Prelaticall faction, against the Mo∣rality of that Day, and to counte∣nance the prophanation of the same, to the manifest indangering of Souls, prejudice of the true Religion, great dishonour of Almighty God, and pro∣vocation of his just wrath and indig∣nation against this Land; The Lords and Commons for remedy thereof, do Order and Ordain, and be it Or∣dered and Ordained, That all the Laws enacted, and in force, concer∣ning the Observation of the Lords

more witnesses by oath (which the said Iustice, chief Officer or Officers, is by this Ordinance authorised to minister) shall find any person offen∣ding in the premisses, the said Iustice, or chief Officer or Officers, shall give warrant under his or their hand and seal, to the Constables or Church-wardens of the Parish or Parishes where such offence shall be commit∣ted, to seize the said Goods, cryed, shewed forth, or put to sale as afore∣said; and to leavy the said other forfei∣tures or penalties by way of distresse, and sale of the Goods of every such offender, rendring to the said offen∣ders the overplus of the moneys rai∣sed thereby; And in default of such distresse, or in case of insufficiency, or inability of the offender to pay the said forfeitures or penalties, that the party offending be set publikely in the Stocks by the space of three hours; And all and singular, the forfeitures or penalties aforesaid, shalbe imployed and converted to the use of the poor of the Parish where the said offences shall be committed, saving onely, that it

An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parli∣ament, for the better Observing and Keeping a Monethly Fast, within the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales. VVHereas the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, upon the request of the Lords and Commons in this present Parlia∣ment assembled, and by and with their advice and consent, considering the la∣mentable and distressed condition of his good Subjects in the Kingdom of Ireland; (that there might be a ge∣nerall Humiliation of all the Estates of this Kingdom before▪ Almighty God in Fasting and Prayer) was graciously pleased to command the keeping of a Monethly Fast; and to the end that all persons might the bet∣ter
take notice thereof (and to leave such without excuse, as should not duly keep and observe the same) did afterward by his Proclamation of the 8th of Ianuary 1641. appoint that the same should be generally, publike∣ly, and solemnly holden, and kept, as well by abstinence from food, as by publike prayers, preaching, and hear∣ing of the Word of God, and other Religious and holy duties, in all Ca∣thedrals, Collegiate and Parish Chur∣ches and Chappels, within the King∣dom of England and Dominion of Wales, (without any exception) on the last Wednesday of every Moneth, to continue during the troubles in the said Kingdom of Ireland: All which his Majesty did straightly charge and command, should be reverently and devoutly performed by all his Sub∣jects, as they desire the blessing of Al∣mighty God, and would avoyd his heavy indignation against this Land and people; and upon pain of such punishments as may justly be inflicted upon all such as shall contemne or neglect so Religious a work and duty.
And whereas the Lords and Com∣mons in both Houses of Parliament, have received divers informations from severall parts of this Kingdom and Dominion of Wales, of the great neglect of the due observation and keeping of the said Fast upon the dayes appointed, and of the propha∣nations of the same, by many irreli∣gious, ill-affected, loose, and scan∣dalous persons, as well of the Clergy as others, who are so farre from af∣flicting their soules, and loosing the bands of wickednesse, as that they provoke the wrath of Almighty God, and make so pious a meanes to pro∣cure his blessings, the occasion of greater Iudgements. For the prevention whereof for the time to come, the Lords and Com∣mons do Order, Declare, Ordain, that in all and every the Cathedrals, Col∣legiate, and Parish Churches and Chappels, within the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, (without any exception) upon e∣very Lords day, next and immediately before any the dayes appointed for
the said publike Fast, the Parson, Vi∣car, Curate, or Minister, that upon that day shall Officiate, or exercise in any of the said Cathedrals, Collegiate, Parish Churches or Chappels, shall give publike notice in every of the said Cathedrals, Collegiate, Parish Churches or Chappels respectively, of the Fast day next ensuing, immediate∣ly after Sermon, or prayer ended in the forenoon, before the Congrega∣tion be dismissed, carnestly exhorting and perswading all the people to the Solemne due keeping, and Religious observation of the whole day appoint∣ed for the said Fast, and that they would repair to some Church or Chappell, there diligently and reve∣rently to attend all such holy duties as shall be used in the observance of the same; that they forbear to use all manner of sports and pastimes what∣soever, and their ordinary Trades and callings upon the said day, as well Carriers, Waggoners, Carters, Wain∣n, Drovers, Butchers, Hucksters, Shop-keepers, Labourers; or any o∣thers using any Art, Trade, Miste∣ry,
or manuall Occupation whatsoe∣ver, and that all Vintners, Taverners, Ale-house-keepers, and keepers of Victualling-houses, do forbear to keep open their doors, Bulks, or Shops, or to sell or utter (except in cases of extream necessity) any Wine, Beer, Ale, or victuall, till the publike exer∣cises, and Religious duties of that day in the respective Cathedrals, Collegi∣ate, Parish Churches and Chappels, be past and over. And lastly, all and every the Iusti∣ces▪ of the Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, Constables, Church-wardens, and o∣ther Officers, inhabiting or residing within the limits or precincts of any such Cathedrall, Collegiate, Parish Church or Chappell, are hereby re∣quired to take speciall notice aswell of such Parson, Vicar, Curate, or o∣ther Minister that ought to Officiate in any of the said Cathedrals, Colle∣giate, and Parish Churches or Chap∣pels, upon any such day appointed for the said Fast, that shall either refuse or neglect to do the same, or not do or cause the same to be done in that reli∣gious
and solemn manner as it ought to be, or that shall refuse to give notice of the Fast day, at the time and in man∣ner as aforesaid, and forthwith to re∣turn their names, and the names of all such (from time to time) as shall wilfully offend herein, in contempt of the Laws, His Majesty, and both Houses of Parliament, unto some one or more of the Knights, Citizens, or Burgesses that serve for the county where such offence is, or shall be com∣mitted, that some speedy course may be taken for the severe punishing of such as shall offend herein according to the Laws. Die Mercurii, 22. Aug. 1642. Ordered by the Commons assem∣bled in Parliament, That this Ordinance be forthwith Printed and published: H: Elsynge, Cler. Parl. D. Com.
24 April, 1643. VVHereas the Lords and Commons in Parlia∣ment, have made an Ordinance for the more strict and solemne keeping of the dayes of publike Fast, which are not by all per∣sons duly observed, even in these times of publike calamity, to the great dishonour of God, and the contempt of the Autho∣rity of both Houses of Parlia∣ment. Now that more particu∣lar notice may be given unto all such as shall offend herein, be∣fore any exemplary punishment be inflicted upon them; It is ordered by the Commons now Assembled in Parliament, That all Constables (or their Depu∣ties) shall the day before every
publike Fast, repair to every House within their severall and respective liberties, and charge all persons, That they strictly observe the Fast, according to the directions in the said Or∣dinance. And they shall upon the said dayes of the publike Fast, walk through their said liberties, dili∣gently searching for, and taking notice of all persons, who ei∣ther by following their work of their calling, or sitting in Ta∣verns, Victualling or Alehouses, or any other wayes shall not du∣ly observe the same: And they are hereby required to return the Names of all such persons as they shall finde so offending, as also such Informations as they shall receive against any other
persons within their liberties, guilty of the like offence unto the Committee for Examinati∣ons, that so they may be pro∣ceeded against for the contempt of the said Ordinance; And all Constables are to observe these directions from time to time, so long as the said publike Fast shall be kept, without expect∣ing any further Order.
