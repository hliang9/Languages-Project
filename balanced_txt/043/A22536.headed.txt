WHereas a Proclamation was heretofore publi∣shed by Our deare Father King IAMES of blessed memorie, in the twentieth yeere of His Reigne, for the better supportation and Reiglement of the Plantations within Our Territory of New England in America, whereby, amongst diuers other things, the in∣sufferable abuses committed by diuers Interloping and irregular Merchants, and disobedient Fishermen and Mariners, were pro∣hibited, who seeking only their present and priuate profit, did Trade with the Saluages of that Countrey, and to the great preiudice and danger of Our louing Subiects the Planters there, did Barter away to the Saluages, Swords, Pikes, Mus∣kets, Fowling Pieces, Match, Powder, Shotte, and other Warlike Armes, Weapons, and Munition, and teach them the vse thereof, not onely to their owne present ruine (di∣uers of them hauing been slaughtered by the barbarous people with their owne Weapons formerly sold by them) but also to the great hazard of the liues of the English already, plan∣ted there, and to the apparant destruction of that hopefull Plantation. Wee, being informed that these abuses are still continued to the indangering of that Plan∣tation, and that the like abuses are also practised in other Forreigne Plantations: Out of Our Princely care for the prosperity of these Colonies, which being well gouerned may be of great vse to this Nation, for the reformation and preuention of these and the like enor∣mities for the future.
