Here after en∣sueth a propre treatyse of good workes.
The preface. IT is not vnknowen to all men (good chrysten reader) but that the true & syncere teachers of the infallyble truthe of our sauyour Iesu Chryst, ben falsely defamed vnto the vnlear¦ned people, & theyr good name defaced to the, no lytell hynde∣raunce and reproche of the same truth / in yt they (as they be borne in hāde vniustly) shulde in theyr wrytynges and sermons, allure and withdrawe the forsayd rude people from penaūce, frō prayer, from fastyng, from watchynge, frō paynes, from labours / & fy∣nally from all good work{is}. But what they ben and theyr workes also whiche reproue, sclaunder, calumpnyate, and falsely impe∣che the pure, syncere, and true worde of god pronounced by the mouthes of those his good and
vertuous seruauntes / it is nowe (thanked be god) ryghte metely well perceyued / ye and for what intent, truely for none other, thā for the mayntenaunce of the god theyr belyes, theyr ambycyon, theyr symony, theyr pryde, theyr promocyon, theyr treason, theyr trechery, theyr glotony, theyr le∣cherye, theyr murdre, with all theyr vngracyousnes. God ther∣fore moste good and almyghtye of his excedynge and bountefull mercy and grace, to declare and set forth his infinyte goodnes to¦wardes his electe, moste welbe∣loued and faythful seruauntes / that they to theyr great conforte and consolacyon, may be proued innocent of this most vntrue ac∣cusacyon wrongfully layde vn∣to theyr charge / and chiefely to the garnysshynge and deckynge
of his emperyall glory, & mayn∣tenaūce of his vndoubtable tru∣the, hathe sent the here (O reder) a ryghte famous and excellent worke, wherin is comprehended what good workes be / howe we may please god in all oure wor∣kes / & howe our workes do not please hym, and out of what foū¦tayne they ought to spryng and flowe, yf they shulde please his godhede: truely out of the fres∣she and lyuyng fountayne of an vndoubted faythe & truste / that his moste benygne petye, swet∣nes, and gentylnes, which is the father of all mercyes, & the god of all consolacyon and conforte / dothe loue the, fauoure the, pe∣tye the, accepte the. And thy wor∣kes also done at his cōmaunde∣ment, for the blode, passyon, re∣dempcyon, and satysfaccyon of
his moste dere and welbeloued sone Iesu Chryst / in whome, by whome, and for whose sake thou arte thus entyerly loued, fauou∣red, and accepted. As wytnessed our father of heuen hym selfe at the baptysme of our sauyour Ie¦su Christe, sayenge. This is my welbeloued sone, in whom or for whose sake I am well pleased, that is to say, appeased and swa¦ged of my wrathe, immedyately here hym, that is to saye, beleue, truste hym, stycke & cleaue harde to hym by faythe. For it is he for whom I delyte in you, loue you, fauour you, petye you, & accepte bothe you and your dedes. This is the fountayne, out of the whi∣che all the workes of a chrysten man oughte to procede / so that what soeuer buddeth out of the tre of this fayth, is accepted and
pleasaunte before god / and els it is but synne and not accepted. As saynte Paule wryteth in the xiiii. chapytre to the Romaynes / what soeuer (sayth he) is not of faythe is synne. And in the .xi. chapytre to the Hebrues, with∣out faythe it is impossyble for a∣ny man to please god. The rea∣son why is this, albeit thou be∣stowe neuer so moche in almes / fast neuer so moch, paye neuer so moch, watche neuer so moch / yea albeit thou haddest done as ma∣ny good dedes as all the worlde. Yet yf thou haue not the faythe before rehersyd / that god for the blode of his sone doth accept the & thy workes / loue the, fauoure the, petye the / yea and that enty∣erly and as his owne son & heyre by adopcyon, all that euer thou doste can not please god / but is
abomynable synne and dysplea∣syth hym vtterly. For howe is it possyble that thou shuldest plea∣se hym, whan thou art but a Iu¦das vnto hym & doste beare two faces in one hoode / doynge one and thynkynge another. In thy dedes thou woldeste seme to be his seruaunte, & in thy hert thou dost neyther loue hym, nor truste that he loueth the. And albeit he hathe made neuer so many and great {pro}myses of saluacyon, mer¦cye, loue, pety, and fauour, in the blod of his sone to al that repent & doubt not therof / but assured∣ly truste vnto it, yet thou (what soeuer thou arte that haste not this fayth) lyke an hethen houn∣de, and an vnfaythfaull myscre∣aunt, by thy infydelyte and false herte dost make no better of hym but a lyer, and false of his pro∣myse
/ a tyraunte, and a butchers curre delytyng in blode, and ney¦ther doste thou loue hym, truste hym, nor fauour hym. For howe shuldest thou loue hym, whan thou accōptest no better of hym than I haue sayde. And agayne howe is it possyble that he shuld loue the, fauoure the, petye the, accepte other the or thy workes, seynge thou doste fyrste abiecte hym by thy synful dyspayre and incredulytie. Yea what worldlye prince wold kepe such a wretche in his house yf he knewe hym / howe moche lesse than wolde he loue hym, fauoure hym, accepte hym, or any of his seruyce. Aga∣ynste suche workes it is that the true and faythfull mynysters of Chrystes worde haue foughten, as done in most false hypocrysye and deuelysshe despayre, whiche
otherwyse they haue & do hyghe¦ly prayse and cōmende, as whan they be done in true faythe and loue towarde god & his cōmaun¦dementes, as thou shalte se and fynde in this moste goodly and excellente volume of good wor∣kes / whiche (I beseche god ne∣uer to fauour me) yf any of those vntrue men / I wyll not saye, false deceyuers, dyd euer wryte to teach any thyng halfe so good in theyr lyues. But it is an olde prouerbe that a good thyng wyl prayse it selfe / wherfore I com∣mytte it vnto thyne owne iudge¦ment (good reader) to prayse it, euer as thou shalte fynde cause / So bolde I am of the goodnes therof. And yf thou fynde my word{is} to be true, that good wor∣kes be here of our auctor requy∣red, taught, praysed, and cōmen∣ded
to the vttermost, (as the tru∣the is) then I beseche the (moste gentyll and indyfferent reader) to take & admytte all false backe byters & sclaunderers of goddes true mynysters euermore here∣after as they be, & not to thynke the contrary, but yt as they most deadely belye those good men in this behalfe / so they do also in o∣ther thynges, as I truste in god it shall more playnly appere / bo∣the to the (gentyll reader) & ther∣to to all the worlde in tyme com¦myng. And that as I beleue vn∣fayned to the great glorye of the lyuyng god, the inestymable so∣lace and comforte of his electe chyldren, and the vtter confusy∣on of the chyldren of Antechrist? So be it. ¶Here endeth the preface of this present worke.
dieu et mon droit De bonis ope∣ribus.
¶Here begyn¦neth the boke of good workes. IT is fyrst of all to be knowen yt there is no good worke / but yt whiche god hath cōmaunded / & agayne,What synne is. that there is no synne / but that whiche he hathe forby∣den and prohibyted. Therfore he that wyll knowe or do good wor¦kes, nedeth but the knowlege of goddes cōmaundementes. For so sayth Chryste.Math. 16. Mathewe the xvi. If thou wylt entre into lyfe / kepe the cōmaundementes. And also to the yong man / that asked hym what he shulde do to be sa∣ued. Chryste shewed nothynge,
but the ten commaundementes. Wherfore it is necessarye that we learne the dyfference of good workes, not by the vtter shewe greatnes or multytude of ye wor¦kes in thē self / no truely neyther after the oppynyon or iudgemēt of men / neyther after the ma∣ner of lawes, tradycyons, or in∣uencyons of man / or by any rea∣son appearynge vnto our syght, (as we haue done hytherto). For so shuld it be through our blyn∣denes, to the great dispysyng of goddes cōmaundementes. THe fyrste and chiefe and most excellent of all good workes, is faythe in Chryste. Euen as he hym selfe sayeth Iohn̄ the .vi.Iohn̄. 6. For to the Iewes askynge hym what they
shulde do to worke the workes of god. He answered, this is the worke of god / that ye beleue in hym, whome he hathe sente. But we other hearyng or preachyng this thynge / passe ouer it lyght∣lye, thynkyng it but a tryfle and easye to be done / whan notwith∣standyng we ought here to ma∣ke a staye, and faythfullye to re∣mēbre in our mynde. For of this worke and fayth muste all other good workes sprynge and take theyr influence of goodnes / and that men may the better percey∣ue this thynge / I shall declare it more grosely. A man shall fynde many that faste, praye, and do this thyng and that thynge, and lyue a good lyfe, to se to before men? whome yf thou do aske / whether they be sure yt they plea¦se god or no, bycause they do so
lyue. They wyll answere that o∣ther they knowe not, or els that they doubte. Moreouer there be some doctours whiche corrupte and deceyue the people / sayenge it is no nede that they be sure of this thynge / and yet they teache vs nothynge els but good wor∣kes. Beholde all suche workes, procede without faythe. For su∣che as is theyr conscyence & fay∣the towarde god / suche ben the workes that ronne out of them. But where as is no faythe nor good and a certayned conscyen∣ce toward god / there lacketh the hede of good workes, & all theyr lyfe and goodnes is nothynge worthe at all before god. Vpon this it commeth,The author is falsely cō∣dempned of hypocrytes. that whyles I prayse & make so moche of fay∣the / and do caste awaye (as of no value before god) the workes of
suche vnfaythfull / there be some whiche blame and accuse me, as thoughe I dyd forbydde & con∣dempne good workes. Howe be it in the meane tyme I desyre no thynge more vehementlye / than that I myghte teache truely the good workes of faythe. MOreouer yf thou as∣ke thē, whether they iudge & esteme this for a good worke or no / whanne they la∣bour theyr crafte with theyr hā∣des, whan they stande. Go, eate, drynke, slepe, and do all other maner of workes / other ap{per}tay∣nynge to the sustentacyon of the body, or necessary for the cōmen welth / and whether they byleue yt they please god in these thing{is} or no. Thou shalte fynde some
that wyll say nay / and that wyll conclude good workes in so ly∣tell space, and defyne theym so straytely / that they wyll take no thyng for good workes / but one¦ly prayenge in the temples / fa∣styng, & helpyng the poore with almes / demynge all other thyn∣ges to be voyde and vayne / and suche as god settyth not by. And so by theyr dāpnable vnbyleue / they mynysshe, deceyue and ab∣breuyate goddes seruyce & wor∣shyp, to whome serueth / what so euer is done or can be thoughte in faythe. So teacheth the wyse man / sayenge.Ecclesiasti∣ces. 9. Go therfore and eate thy breade in myrthe, & with ioye drynke thy wyne / for thy workes please god / lette thy clo∣thes be whyte at all tymes / and let not thy heade lacke oyle / vse gladlye thy lyfe with thy wyfe,
whom thou louest in all ye dayes of thy lyfe of vnstablenes, whi∣che be gyuen to the all the tyme of thy vanyte. Our clothes to be whyte at all tymes / is all oure workes to be good / what name so euer they be called by indyffe∣rently. But than they be whyte, whā I am sure they please god. And hauynge this affyrmytie I shal neuer lacke ye oyle of a mery and ioyfull conscyence from the heade of my soule / so sayd christ. Iohn̄ the .viii. chapytre. I do al∣waye those thinges which plea∣se hym, meanynge of the father.Iohn̄. 8. How dyd he alwayes those thyn¦ges / dyd he not at all tymes con¦uenyent, bothe eate, drynke and slepe: wherupō saynt Iohn̄ saith By this know we / that we be of the truthe / and wyll before hym put our hertes out of doubt / for
yf our herte condēpne vs / god is greater thā our hert / & knoweth all thynges / & we haue truste to∣warde god / yt what soeuer we as∣ke of hym, we shal haue it / bycau¦se we kepe his cōmaūdemētes & do those thynges which be plea∣saūt before hym.To be borne of god, is to byleue and trust in god. Also he that is borne of god, yt is to say / he yt by∣leueth & trusteth in god, synneth not / nother can he synne. Also ye xxxiii. Psalme / all that trust in ye shall not do amysse. ye in the ii. psalme / blessed be all men yt trust in hym / which sayeng{is} yf they be true, what soeuer they do muste ned{is} be good / or at ye least if they do syn̄e, it must be & be forgyuen & {per}doned. Beholde here agayne howe greatly I do extolle fayth / to yt which I wyl referre al good work{is} / but I reiecte what soeuer is done, yt cōmeth not frō thense.
HEre maye euery man lyghtly consydre and perceyue / whan he do∣the good / and whan he dothe yll / for yf he fynde his herte instructe with this faythe that he byleueth that he pleaseth god / than is his worke good / ye thoughe it be so lytell or so vyle,This fayth and conscy∣ence must be groūded vp¦pon the wor∣de of god / whiche we muste haue to shewe for vs, that we do nothyng but that, yt is his godly wyll & plea∣sure. For wt out this wor¦de, we can not be sure, what he wol¦de haue done or vndon, & must therfor cōsequently stāde in dis∣payre of our dedes, whe∣ther they ben good or no / which saynt Paule cal∣leth synne. as to take vp a strawe / but yf there lacke other trust or hope in god / then the worke is nought / ye yf he shuld rayse vp all deade men / & suffre hym selfe to be bur∣ned / so taught saynt Paule say∣enge / that what soeuer is not of fayth / is synne. For of fayth and of none other worke / we be or∣nate by this name / that we be called chrystyanes / as of the chefe worke. For as for all other workes / euery hethen Iewe, tur¦ke and syn̄er may do them. But
to trust & byleue stedfastely that oure workes please god / is not possyble / but to a chrystyan, il∣lustrate & stablisshed by the gra∣ce of god. But suche teachynge as this, is very scante. And ther∣fore I am accused to be an here∣tyke / the cause wherof is, yt men folowynge blynde reason & gen∣tylles doctryne / haue put faythe not aboue, but nyghe vnto other vertues / attrybutynge vnto it a peculyer and propre worke sepa¦rated from all other workes of other vertues. Notwithstādyng that faythe onely, doth make all other workes good, acceptable, & worthy, in that / that it trusteth in god,Ones agay¦ne remembre that this fay¦the muste be buylded vp¦on the word of god & for∣get it no mo¦re, for so me∣aneth thau∣ctor. & doubteth not / but what so euer a man dothe / it is well done in the syght of god: ye they haue not suffered faythe to re∣mayne as a worke / but (after
theyr maner of speakynge) haue made it a vayne qualytie / all though all holy scrypture do at∣trybute / ye name of godly good∣nes to faythe onely & no worke elles. Wherfore it is no mer∣uayle that they theym selfes be made blynde and the leaders of the blynde. For as this faythe dothe brynge with her charyte & peace, so doth she ioye and hope / for who so euer byleueth & trus∣teth ī god / to hym strayght waye god gyueth the holy ghost / wyt∣nesse saynte Paule to the Gala∣tiens sayenge. Ye haue receyued the spyryte, not by youre good workes / but bycause ye haue by∣leued the worde of god. IN this faythe al workes be made lyke and equall / and one as good as another. In
this faythe also falleth away all dyfference of workes,For with∣out faythe it is impossy∣ble to please god, as say∣eth Paule ye xi. chapyter to the He∣brewes. whether they be great or lytell, longe or shorte, many or fewe / for ye wor∣kes be pleasaunt to god not for them selfes but for faythes sake / whiche onely and specyally and without any dyfferēce worketh, quyckeneth, and maketh accep∣table, all and synguler workes howe many and sondrye so euer they be / none otherwayes, than as all the membres of a mannes body, lyue, worke, & haue theyr name, by the goodnes and ver∣tue of the heade. And without ye heade, no membre can lyue, wor∣ke, or haue the name of a lyuyng membre / of the whiche thynge it foloweth more largelye / that a chrystyan lyuyng in this faythe, hath no nede of a techer of good workes / but to do all thyng that
commeth to his hande. And all thynges be well done / as holye Samuel said vnto Saule / thou shalte be chaunged into another man whan the spyryte of ye lorde shal come into the / than do what soeuer cōmeth to thy hande / god is with the. So rede we of holy Anne Samuels mother / whan she byleued Hely the preest, pro∣mysynge her the fauour of god / she wente home mery and pacy∣fyed, neyther after that chaūged her countenaunce, that is to say, all thyng{is} were afterwardes vn¦to her one & equall, what soeuer fortuned vnto her. Also saynte Paule sayde, all thynges be free there as the spiryte of god is / for fayth suffereth not her selfe to be bounde to any workes / nor a∣gayne any workes, to be taken from her / but euen as it is wry∣ten
in the fyrste Psalme / she gy∣ueth her frute in due season / that is howe so euer it commeth or chaunseth. WHiche thynge we may se by a grosse and carnall exam∣ple, after yt a man or woman hath cō¦ceyued a moche specyall loue, & a synguler mynde and fauoure one of thother, and stedfastly by leueth the same / who shall than teache them howe to behaue thē selfe one to thother / or what they ought to do to leaue vndone, to saye / to kepe close, or to thynke? for this onely & specyall truste / that one hathe in thother / tea∣cheth them al thynges and more than is necessarye. And than the∣re is no dyfference in workes /
but eyther of theym dothe great workes, longe workes, & many workes, as gladly as small wor¦kes, shorte workes, or fewe wor∣kes. And that with a mery, pa∣cyfyed, and quyete herte, and vt∣terlye of a fre mynde / but after yt there is any doubte, than ryse & growe in ye mynde dyuers yma∣gynacyons what shall be best to do. And yf it be the man, than he begynneth to appoynt hym selfe with the dyfference of workes, wherby he may obtayne fauour, & yet euen thā he cōmeth almost lyke a prysoner wt a heuy herte, & great trouble, & more than halfe loste, and desperate / and ofte ty∣mes amōges these thyng{is} play∣eth the foole. So a christen man lyuynge in this hope and truste towardes god / knoweth all thin¦ges, may do all thynges / goeth
about to do all thynges, and he dothe all thynges merely, & fre∣lye / not to heape and gather to¦gyther many merytes and good workes / but that it is delyte and pleasure to hym so to please god well, and purely and frely to ser∣ue god / beynge contente with this onely thynge that he plea∣seth god. And of the contrarye partye, he agreeth not / nor is at one with god by faythe / whiche doubteth of hym / & whiche sea∣keth and busely careth howe he wolde satisfye and moue god by many workes / and than he ron∣neth to saynt Iames, to Rome, to Iherusalem / hyther and thy∣ther, this waye and that waye / sayeth saynt Brigettes prayers / sayeth this and sayeth that / he fasteth this day and that day / he confesseth hym here, he cōfesseth
hym there / he asketh this man & that man / & yet in all this tyme he fyndeth no reste nor quyete∣nes / doynge all these thynges wt great payne, doutfulnes, indyg∣nacyon and sorowe of his herte / in so moch that scrypture calleth these good work{is} in the Hebrew tonge / Aueu, Amall. Whiche we call in oure tonge werynesse and labour. Howe be it truely they be not good workes / but all loste, voyde & vayne, whiche ben done in suche doubte & dotage. Wher¦fore many men otherwhyles ha∣ue so doted in these / that for so∣rowe they haue fallen in to ma∣ny troubles / of whom it is sayd / we be werye in the waye of ini∣quytie and perdycyon,Sap. 5. we haue walked harde wayes / but the waye of the lorde we haue not knowen, and the sonne of ryght∣wysenes
hath not shyned to vs. BYcause that faythe yet nowe and then appeareth in oure workes ryght sma¦le, feble, & weake / let vs aske moreouer them / that be oppressyd with any trouble & aduersytie / eyther of body, or of goodes, or of honour, or of fren∣des, or of any other thyng{is} that they haue / whether yt than they byleue, that they please god / and whether they thynke, that theyr trouble and aduersyties be mer∣cyfully put to theym by the very fauoure of god or no / and here they wyll saye, that god sheweth hym selfe wrothe and angrye / whan neuerthelesse euen in such vexacyons & trouble a true chry∣styan hath stedfaste truste / & per∣suadeth
farre better thinges vn∣to hym selfe of god / that he bea∣reth moch better good wyll and fauoure than appeareth. For in suche case he is hyd, euen as the spouse sayeth in the cantycles? Beholde he standeth behynde ye walle, and seeth me through the creastes / that is to saye, in vexa∣cyons and aduersyties, whiche are lyke almoste to departe vs frō hym, as a wall or a bulwar∣ke / he stādeth hydde, and yet lo∣kynge vpon me he forsaketh me not / for he standeth and is redye to helpe me in grace, sufferynge hym selfe to be sene by the wyn∣dowes of darke fayth. And Hye∣remye in the boke of Threnes / he hath loued vs after his herte / and hath caste downe the sones of men / this faythe they knowe not but thynke they be forsaken
of god, and that god is enemye to them. Yea and they rather im∣pute such ylles to men and wyc∣ked deuylles / so that they haue no truste at all in god. And for this cause, theyr troubles & suf∣frynges euen as they be sclaun∣derous to them / so be they hurt∣full. And yet in that whyle they go forthe doynge good workes after theyr owne iudgement / lo∣kynge nor carynge nothynge at all for this true faythe. But to thē that byleue in god / and that in suche ylles and troubles haue a stedfaste truste that they please god / suche ylles and aduersyties be precyous merytes and moste noble of all workes,Faythe ma∣keth al thyn¦ges precy∣ous. aboue all mennes estymacyon / for faythe and truste to god maketh al thin¦ges precyous, whiche ylles be dampnable / the whiche thynge
is wryten euen of dethe / the .115. psalme / the death of his sayntes is precyous in the syghte of the lord / for the more better, hygher and stronger that the faythe and truste is / so moche more the suf∣ferynges in the same fayth, passe all workes in faythe / And so by∣twene workes & suche passyons, there is an inestymable dyfferēce of better place cōdycyon & pryce. MOreouer ye hyghest degree of faythe is whan god ponys∣sheth our cōscyence not onelye with temporall hur∣tes and persecutyons / The hyghest degre of fay∣the. but with deathe, helle, and synne / and se∣meth in a maner to denye his grace and mercye, as thoughe he wolde perpetuallye dampne vs / the which thynge very fewe
men perceyue / as Dauid cōplay¦neth the .vi. psalme / lorde correc∣te me not in thy angres / for to byleue then that we please god / is the chiefe worke that may be done of or in any creature / of the whiche these iustytiaryes & holy workemen & benefactours kno∣we nothyng at all / He calleth them iustiti∣aries, which truste of for∣gyuenesse of theyr synnes & of saluacy on by theyr owne wor∣kes and ho∣lynesse. for how wol∣de they here promyse or {per}suade the goodnes and mercye of god to thē / whan they be vncertayne in theyr workes / and doubtfull and waueryng, yea in the leaste degre of faythe. Beholde thus haue I alwayes spoken & thus haue I alwayes praysed fayth / & thus haue I reiecte al workes done without suche faythe / to thende yt I myght brynge men from this false, fayned, shynyng pharysaycall and vnfaythefull good workes (wherof all Ab∣beyes,
tēples, houses, & al degres and states bothe hygh and lowe be full and replenysshed with) to moste and true good & fayth∣ful workes euen from the groun¦de / in the whiche thynge no man stryueth or goeth agaynste me / but vnclene beastes whose feate be not clouen (as hit is in ye lawe of Moyses) not sufferyng ye dyf∣ference of good work{is}. But they rousshe out so vnaduysed that whan they haue onelye prayed, fasted, founded this chauntrye or that / cōfessed them / and done satisfactyō after theyr owne iud∣gement / they wold by and by ha¦ue all these doynges good / all though in all these thynges they haue no truste of the lyberalytye or gentylnes of god / but rather they than specyally esteme them for good workes / whan they ha¦ue
done many / great, and longe workes / and so they regard not the grace of god nother his ple∣asure in theyr workes / but put all theyr truste in theyr workes / and so buylde vpon the grauell and the water / wherfore at the laste / they muste neades haue a great fall. As Chryste sayeth / Mathewe the .vii. chapytre / but this good wyll and pleasure of god the father towarde vs vpō the whiche standeth our trust / ye aungelles shewed from heuen that nyghte that our lorde was borne / syngyng prayse be to god aboue / peace in the yerthe / and to men good wyll. BEholde nowe this is ye wor¦ke of the fyrste cōmaunde∣ment / wherby it is cōmaun¦ded that thou shuldest haue no
straūge god / which is asmoch to saye as thus. For asmoche as I am onely god / thou oughtest to put all thy truste, hope, & faythe, in me and none els / for it is not to haue one god / yf thou name hym with thy mouthe outwarde¦lye, or worshyppe hym with kne¦lynge, or other suche gestures / but yf thou truste in hym th herte and mynde promysyng to thy selfe all goodnes, grace, and good wyll of hym / as well in {per}∣secucyon and aduersytie / as in prosperyte / no lesse in deth than in lyfe / as well in bytter & harde thynges / as in pleasaunt & easy / lyke as our lorde Chryste / sayde to the woman of Samarytan / god is a spiryte / and they which worshyppe hym / must worshyppe hym in spyryte and truthe. And this truste, hope, and faythe of ye
herte / is the true full lyuynge of the fyrste cōmaundement with∣out the whiche, there is no wor∣ke at all that maye satysfye this cōmaūdement / and lyke as this cōmaundement is chief / hyghest and beste of all other / and out of the whiche all other come / in the whiche all thynges procede / and after ye whiche, all thynges must be ordered and reweled / so this worke / that is to saye, hope and truste in the grace of god, is chy∣ef / hyghest and beste of all other work{is} / out of ye whiche all other growe & come forth / be orderyd & gouerned. All other workes therfore cōpared to this worke / stāde (without the fulfyllyng of ye fyrste cōmaūdemēt) as nothyn∣ge worth / and as thoughe there were no god.S. Augus∣tyne. wherfore saynt Au¦gustyne sayde excellentlye / that
the workes of the fyrste cōmaun¦dement, be / to byleue, truste, and loue. Moreouer we sayde before that suche fayth and truste, bryn¦gen with theym charyte and ho∣pe / ye and yf thou wylt well con¦sydre the matter / charyte is fyrst at the leaste equall with faythe / For I can not truste in god / oneles I thynke that he is gentyll / mercyfull, meke, and kyn∣de to me / wherby I am moued to loue hym agayne, & to trust to hym with all my mynde vt∣terlye determyned with my self that he wyll do all thynges for the best to me.
NOwe thou seest that all they, whiche by∣leue not alwaye in god, and {pro}myse not to thē selfes the gra∣ce, fauoure, & good wyll of hym, in all theyr workes and vexacy∣cyons, lyfe, or deathe / but seke it about other thynges or elles in theym selfes / kepe not this com∣maundement of god / but truely vse ydolatrye / ye thoughe they dyd the workes of all thother cō¦maundementes / ye in so moche yf they had caste in one heape to¦gyther / the prayers, fastynges, obedyence, sufferaunce, chastyte, and innosencye of all sayntes / for there is not the pryncypall & heade worke / without the whi∣che all other work{is} be nothnyge at all / but fayre shynynge out∣warde showes, and colours / of ye
whiche our lorde hathe warned vs before. Mathewe the .vii. cha¦pytre / beware of false prophetes which come to you in shepes clo¦thynge / wtin they be rauysshyng wolues / of the whiche sorte be they / whiche go about to gette ye fauoure of god (as they speake) with many good workes & hym theyr frynde, as thoughe they shulde bye his grace & fauoure / as thoughe god were a broker, seller, and a merchaunte / whiche wolde not frely gyue his grace in good wyll. These ben ye moste frowardes of all the men in the worlde / And whiche eyther har∣dely or elles neuer be conuerted to the true waye. Lykewyse be those whiche in theyr trouble & aduersitye, ronne hyther & thy∣ther vp and downe / sekyng coū∣sell, helpe and conforte, and lette
god alone / of whome oonly they be cōmaunded to seke suche thin¦ges / whome the prophete Esaye rebuketh after this maner. My people is folysshe / and hathe not tourned agayne to hym that stro¦ke hym / that is to saye, the lorde hath stryken theym, and sende to theym all maner of trouble vexa¦cyons, and aduersytie that they myghte ronne to hym and truste to hym / but they rōne from hym to men nowe in to Egypte, now in to Assiria / ye and somtyme to yll deuylles / of the whiche Ido∣latrye, there be many thynges redde, bothe in the same prophe∣te Esaye / and also in the boke of kynges / and so do nowe a dayes all oure holye Ipocrytes / that whan they be troubled with any aduersytie / they rōne not to god but flye from hym / thynkynge
this oonlye / that they maye be delyuered out of this trouble ey∣ther by them selfe, or elles by mannes helpe / and yet in all these thynges not oonlye iudgyn∣ge them selfe good, but sufferynge all other so to repute and iudge them. THis is the mynde of saynt Paule in ma∣ny places, where he attrybuteth so mo∣che to fayth. A right wyse man lyueth by his faythe / for faythe is the selfe same thyn∣ge / for ye whiche a man is coūted ryghtwyse afore god / therfore
yf ryghtwysenes be in faythe / it is clere ye the same faythe onelye fulfylleth all the cōmaundemen¦tes of god, & maketh ryghtwyse all theyr workes / in as moch as no man is ryghtwyse / but yf he fulfyll all the cōmaundementes of god / and agayne work{is} with∣out faythe iustyfye no man. And therfore saynt Paule with a full mouthe reiecteth workes / and so greatly cōmendeth and prayseth faythe that many beynge offen∣ded with his wordes sayd, than let vs do no good workes. But saynt Paule rebuketh theym / as erronyous and folysshe, and so it is now a dayes / that whan we reiecte these great and shynynge workes done nowe a dayes with out fayth / they say than we must onelye byleue and do no good / for nowe they call the workes of
the fyrst cōmaūdement to synge / to rede, to playe on the organce / to saye seruyce or to celebrate / to say mattens, euensong, or other canonycalle houres / to founde churches, alters, monasteryes, & to honour them and heape them vp with belles, vestementes and suche other treasure, to god, to Rome and other sayntes vpon pylgrymage. Moreouer to were this garment or that knelyng of theyr knees / sayenge the Rosary or psalter of our Ladye doynge al these not before an ydole. But before the holy crosse of god / the ymages of sayntes / & this they call the worshyppyng and pray∣enge to god / whiche thinges bo∣the vserers / adulterers / and all maner of synners do and maye do dayly. Nowe where as these be done with suche a faythe that
we byleue that they please god, thanne they be praysed, not for theyr owne vertue, but for the faythe sake, for the whiche all maner workes (as is sayde byfo∣re) be equalle. But yf we eyther doubte, or iudge god not to be gentyll, or mercyfull vnto vs, or not to please god, or yf we presu¦me to please god, by or after the∣se workes, than be they nothyn∣ge / but verye gyles, dyssymu∣lacyons, and dysceytes oute∣wardlye to worshyppe god, and inwardelye to put hym for an Idole. This therfore is the cau∣se / why I haue so ofte spoken and caste awaye suche workes, pompes, bostynges, and mul∣tytudes of theym / And bycause it is open and manyfeste / that suche workes be done, not one∣lye in doubte, and without su∣che
faythe / but also amonges a thousande men there is scante one that putteth not all his trust in theym / thynkynge surely that so he shall obtayne the grace / or fauour of god / And that he shall preuent his grace / & so to make merchaūdyse with god, the whi∣che thynge god can not suffre / whiche hath promysed his fayth frely / he wolde that we shulde begyn at his grace / through fayth / and in the same to fynysshe all our workes, what so euer they be / and by what na∣me so euer they be called.
OF these thou thy sel∣fe perceyueste, howe greatly these two dif¦fer / to fulfyl the fyrst cōmaundement with outwarde workes / and within∣warde fayth / for the one maketh vs the true lyuynge sones of god / thother maketh the worste ydolatrye and moste hurtefull hypocrytes of the worlde / bryn∣gynge many men in to ye wayes by the great shynynge, and yet sufferyng them to remayne with out faythe / and so wretchedlye deceyue thē styckyng in the out∣warde voyce and apparaūce / of whome Chryste speaketh. Ma∣thewe .xxiiii. Than yf any man shall saye vnto you: lo here is Chryst or there is Chryst byleue it not. Also in Iohn̄ the .iiii. cha∣pytre / woman truste me ye houre
cōmeth whan ye shall neyther in this mountayne, nor yet at Ihe∣rusalem worshyp the father / but the houre cōmeth, and nowe is / whan ye true worshyppers, shall worshyp the Father in spyryte & veryte / for verylye suche the Fa∣ther requyreth to worshyp hym. These and suche other saynt{is} as they haue moued me / so they ou∣ghte to moue all other to caste a∣way this great pompe with Bul¦les, sealles, baners, & pardons / wherwith the myserable people be moued to buylde temples, to gyue and founde abbayes, and suche lyke, and in ye meane tyme fayth is suppressed and put to sy¦lēce, yea rather vtterly oppressed But where fayth hathe no dyffe∣cence bytwyxte workes, there is no worke pompous and prowde better one thā another after her.
And of a truth it is, ye fayth only wyll be ye true worshyp & seruyce of god, not suffryng any such na¦me or prayse to be gyuen to one worke or other / but as far forth as she dothe vouchesalfe / which thynge / she than dothe / whan the worke is done in and of her. But this yll was fygured in the olde testament / whan the Iewes forsoke to offre in the temple, & offred in other places / as in wo∣des and in hylles / euen so do they, which be busye and redy to do all thynges, & neuer do this heade worke of fayth. WHere be they nowe whiche aske what be good work{is}, what they oughte to do, or howe they myghte be good? ye where be they which saye that we so preche faythe that we tea∣che
no good workes, and that there oughte none to be done? Doth not this fyrst cōmaunde∣ment make vs more busynes / than any man can fulfyll? For yf one man were a thousand mē / ye all men or all creatures / yet here he had ynoughe to do / and more than he myght away with, whyles he is cōmaunded to lyue & contynue alwaye in fayth / and trust to god / and to put trust in no other / & so to haue one true god / seynge than that mannes lyfe, can not be one moment wt∣out dede, faute, trouble, or fly∣ghte / for the lyf of man as we se neuer resteth / let hym yt wolde be good and full of good work{is} begynne to be alwaye in this faythe, let hym lerne ofte tyme to do and leaue vndone all thyn¦ges in suche trust / for so shall he
fynde howe great busynes he ha¦the to do / and howe all thynges stande in faythe / and that faythe can not be ydell / and that ye selfe same ydelnes is somtyme the ex∣ercyse and worke of faythe. And to be shorte / there is nothynge yt can perysshe or lose to vs that by¦leue yt all our work{is} please god / for thā they can not be / out good & merytoryous / so sayeth saynt Paule / 1. Corin. 10. whyther therfore ye eate or drynke / or what soeuer you do / do all to the prayse of god / it can not be done in ye same name / but yf it be done in the same fay∣the / Also to the Romaynes / for we knowe well that all thynges worke for the beste to them that loue god. Therfore the sayenge of them that say that we forbyde good workes and preache onely fayth / is lyke as I shulde say to
a sicke man / yf thou haddest hel∣the / thou shuldest haue all ye wor¦kes of thy membres without the whiche / the workes of ye mēbres be nothynge / of this he myght vnderstonde. That I forbyd the workes of the membres / whan my meanynge is that he muste haue helthe, and than worke all the workes of all his membres / so fayth must be the chiefe craft{is}¦man buylder and capytayne in all workes / or elles the workes be vtterly noughte. BVt yf thou saye / why haue we than soo many Lawes, bothe spyrytuall & temporall, so ma∣ny cerymonyes of churches, mo∣nasteryes, and abbeys, to moue cause and prouoke men to good
workes / yf faythe do all thinges after the fyrst cōmaundement? I answere for no cause, but that we al nother haue nor set by this faythe / for yf we all hadde this faythe / we neded no lawes / but euery one of vs shulde do al∣wayes good workes as the sa∣me faythe do teache hym. There be foure maner of men / the fyrst nowe named, whiche neade no lawe, of whome sayeth saynte Paule .i. Timoth .i. The lawe is not gyuen to a ryghtwyse man / ye is, to a faythfull man. For su∣che maner of men, do all what so euer they knowe or may, with a free mynde, regardyng this one¦ly with a sure and stable faythe, that the grace and beneuolence of god helpeth them in all thyn∣ges. The seconde sorte or kynde of mē ben they / which wyl mysse
vse this lybertie / & falsely styc∣kynge & beynge bolde of it waxe slowe / of ye which, speketh saynt Peter in his fyrst epystle, the .ii. chapytre / sayeng for so is ye wyll of god / that with well doynge / ye shulde stoppe the mouthes of al ingnoraūt mē / as fre, & not as thoughe you toke lybertie for a cloke of malicyousnes / but euen as the seruauntes of god / as thoughe he shulde saye / lybertie of faythe gyueth no lycence to synne, nother cloketh it / but gy∣ueth power to do all maner of workes / & to suffre all thinges / howe soeuer they come to hāde / so yt no man is boūde peculyerly to one worke, or to some work{is}. As saynt Paule sayeth to ye Ga∣latianes ye fyrste chapytre. Bre∣therne ye were called into lyber∣tie / onely let not your lybertie be
an occasyon vnto the flesshe / but in loue serue one another / these men therfore must be cōpelled by lawes and kept with doctrynes & warnynges. The thyrde sorte be wycked men / euer redye to synne and vyce / whiche must be compelled bothe with spyrytual and temporall lawes / euen lyke wylde horses and dogges / and yf they amende not / let theym be punysshed with extreme ponys∣shement by the tēporall swerde, as saynte Paule sayeth to the Romaynes the .xiii. chapytre / for rulers are not to be feared of good doers / but of yll / wylte thou be without feare / of the po∣wer? Do well than / and so shalt thou be praysed of the same. For he is the mynyster of god for thy welthe / but yf thou do yll / thou feare / for he beareth
not the swerde for nought / for he is the mynyster of god, to ta∣ke vengeaunce of them that do yll. The fourth kynde of men be they / which be yet wyld, weake, and chyldren in the vnderstan∣dyng of fayth and spyrytuall ly∣fe / whiche must neades be inty∣syd & tyckled as chylderne with outward wordes & cerymonyes, with adournyng the churches wt organnes / and what soeuer is done in the temple / with prayer, fastynge, & what soeuer is vsed, other in the temples, or abbeys / vnto they lerne to knowe fayth / howe be it here is a great faute / that rulers & offycers (alasse for sorowe) be so accustomed & we∣ryed in these cerymonyes & out∣warde workes, and faythe lette alone, which they ought to haue alway to teache aboue these wor¦kes,
lyke as the mother gyueth ye chylde with mylke, other mea∣te, vntyll the chylde it selfe maye eate stronger meate by it selfe. BVt for as moch as we be not al equal & lyke / suche ma∣ner of men muste be forborne & suffe¦red / and we muste obserue and beare those thyng{is} / whiche they obserue and beare / and not dys∣pyse theym / but teache them the true waye of faythe / as teacheth saynt Paule to the Romaynes / xiiii. chapitre / hym that is weake in the faythe / receyue vnto you and lerne hym / the which thyng he dyd hym selfe / the fyrste epys∣tell to the Corinthyanes the .ix. chapytre. And vnto the Iewes (sayeth he) I became as a Iewe,
to wynne the Iewes, to theym ye were vnder the lawe / was I ma¦de as thoughe I had ben vnder the lawe, to wynne theym that were vnder ye lawe. And Chryste in Mathewe the .xvii. chapytre / whan he shulde paye trybute / which he ought not to do / reaso∣ned wt Peter sayenge / of whome do kynges of ye erthe take trybu∣te or poole money? of theyr chyl∣derne or of straungers? Peter sayde vnto hym of straungers / than sayde Ihesus vnto hym a∣gayne, than are the chyldren fre / neuerthelesse leaste we shulde of∣fende theym / go to the see / and caste in thy angle / and take the fysshe / whiche fyrste commeth vp / and whanne thou openeste his mouthe / thou shalte fynde a peace of twelfe pens, that ta∣ke / and paye for the and me /
here we se that as all workes / so all thynges be free to a chrysten man throughe his faythe, & yet he dothe suffre and obserue with the faythfull that / that he is not bounde to do. And that he dothe vpon his lybertie, beynge free, & nothynge doubtynge, that he so dothe please god / and he dothe it gladly / takynge it frelye as any other worke that cōmeth to his hande, without his owne cho∣syng or purpose, & here he dothe onely desyre and requyreth no∣thynge elles but that he maye so worke to please god wt his fayth. But in as moche as we purpo∣sed to teache in this boke which be very true good workes, & we nowe speake of ye hyghest worke of all / it is manyfest ye we speake not of ye secōde, thyrde, or fourth sorte of men / but of the fyrste, to
whome all thother must be lyke in conclusyon, and in the meane whyle, be taught, and suffered of the fyrste. And so suche men of weake faythe / redy alwayes to do good and to lerne better / and yet not able to perceyue and vn∣derstande all thynges, be not to be despysed ī theyr cerymonyes. Blame therfore theyr folysshe blynde teachers, whiche neuer taughte theym faythe, but haue drawen thē so deaplye in to wor¦kes,That is to wytte from that confy∣dence yt they maye be sa∣ued by theyr workes / for els they ma∣ke a god & sauyoure of theyr wor∣kes, whch is hyghe ydola¦trye, and vt¦terly conclu∣deth that the blod of christ is shedde in vayne, for if our workes can saue vs what neded christ to dye & this is thau∣tors mea∣nyng whan so euer he sai¦eth fran wor¦kes. therfore they muste be gent∣lye broughte vp by a lytell and lytell fro workes to faythe / as men do handell a sycke man / & they must be suffered to leane to some workes a whyle, for theyr owne conscyence vntyl they em∣brace faythe a ryght / lest whyles we go about cruelly and sharpe∣ly to plucke them frō theyr wor∣kes,
theyr conscyence be confoun¦ded or troubled, and erre & wa∣uer aboute vncertayne / and so they nother kepe faythe nor wor¦kes. But styffe necked men, hol∣dynge styffelye in theyr workes / not regardynge what is spoken of fayth / ye in so moche they stry∣ue agaynst it / must be let alone / that the blynde maye leade the blynde / as Chryste bothe taught and dyd. BVt peraduēture thou wylte saye, howe shulde I thynke for a suertye yt al my work{is} please god, otherwhyles spea∣kyng, eatynge, drynkynge, & sle∣pynge to moche, or in any other waye swaruynge from ye ryght, the whiche is vnpossyble for me to exchue? I answere, that this questyon proueth / yt thou yet ta∣kest
faythe no other wayes than thou doste other workes, nother doste thou esteme it aboue all o∣ther work{is} / for no other cause is fayth ye chiefe worke, but for by∣cause it remayneth & quencheth these venyall & dayly synnes, by¦cause she byleueth yt god fauou∣reth the, and imputeth not suche daylye falles & fautes, ye more∣ouer yf the fall be dedely / which thyng happeneth seldome or ne∣uer to theym ye lyue in faythe to∣warde god / yet faythe ryseth a∣gayne, & doubteth not but yt by & by all his synnes shall be wea∣red awaye, as it is in the fyrst e∣pystle of Iohn̄ the .ii. chapytre. My lytell chyldren these thyn∣ges wryte I vnto you, that you shulde not synne, and yf any man synne: yet we haue an ad∣uocate with the father, Ihesus
Chryste, whiche is ryghtwyse / & he it is that obtayneth grace for our synnes / not for ours onelye, but also for all the synnes of all the worlde. And the wyse man the .xv. chapytre. Yf we do synne we be thyne knowyng thy great∣nes. And the .xxiiii. chapytre of ye prouerbes seuen tymes in a day the ryghtwyse man falleth and ryseth agayne / ye this faythe & truste muste be so hyghe & strōge that a man maye knowe that all his lyfe & dede is no other thyng but dāpnable synnes in the iud∣gement of god as it is wryten ye 142. psalme / there shal no lyuyng man be iustyfyed in thy syghte / but we shulde rather so dyspayre in our work{is} / that we shulde by∣leue that they can not be good / but by this faythe thynkynge yt we shall haue no iudgement of
god, but pure grace, fauoure, good wyll, gentylnes, and mer∣cye / as it is in the .xxv. Psalme / thy mercy is before my eyes / and I haue delyted in thy truth: and in the .iiii. psalme. Thy lyghte is marked vpon our face (that is ye knowlege of thy grace by fayth) and by ye thou hast gyuen myrth in my herte / for as thou byleuest and trusteth, so shall come vnto the. Lo thus by the mercye and grace of god, and not by theyr owne nature, these vayne and voyde work{is} be without synne / and so by faythe: labourynge wt the same mercye they be good / And so for our workes we maye be a frayed / but for the mercy of god we maye be comforted / as it is wryten, in the .146. psalme / the lorde delyteth in them that feare hym / and in them that truste to
his mercye / so we pray with full trust our father whiche is in he∣uen,We be syn∣ners as con∣cernyng our workes and our owne ly¦fe, but in re∣spect of chry∣stes work{is}, his satysfac∣cyon & blode we be iust & no synners, for because we cleane whooly to hym by fay∣the, for the which we be accepted as no synners. neuerthelesse to forgyue vs oure synnes. We be his sones, neuerthelesse synners. We be ac∣ceptable, and yet haue not made satysfaccyon. But fayth confyr∣med & stablysshed in the truste of god shall do all these thynges. BVt yf thou askest wher fayth & trust maye be founde, & from whense they come truelye, that is most necessarye to be knowen. Fyrst of all without doubt: they come not of thy workes or deser¦uynges, but onelye, frelye, by ye gyfte and promyse of Ihesus chryst, as Paule wryteth to the. Rom̄. the .v. chapyter.Here mayste thou ferne of saynt paule from whens faythe dothe sprīg, & why thou mayste cōmytte the wholy vnto Chryst, and doubte no∣thing ī him, albeit thy sin¦nes be neuer so great. God, set∣teth out his loue that he had to∣warde
vs / seyng that whyle we were synners / Chryste dyed for vs / as though he shuld say / shall not this thyng cause vs to haue a stronge & vnouercōmed fayth that chyrst is deade for our syn∣nes byfore we asked it / and for the whiche we yet cared not, ye euen than, whan we were con∣tynuynge in synne / where after it foloweth. Moche more than nowe (seynge we be iustyfyed in his blode) we shall be preserued from wrathe throughe hym / for yf when we were ennemyes, we were recōsyled to god by ye death of his sone. Moche more seynge we be recōsyled / we shall be pre∣serued by his lyfe / lo howe thou oughtest to ymagen christ in ye, & how god hath set forth & shewed his mercy to ye in hym. Without all thy deseruyng{is} goyng byfore
that out of ye same ymage of his grace / thou shuldest drawe both fayth and trust of forgyuenes of al synnes: wherfore fayth begyn¦neth not of workes nother is it made by workes / for fayth is a worke that ronneth and floweth out of the blode,Faythe. woundes, and deathe of Chryst. In the whiche thynge whan thou seest god so mercyfull vnto the / that he wol∣de gyue his sone for the, thy herte must neades wexe swete / and so thou must neades loue hym agayne and so doth spryng the trust of ye mere grace of god towarde the / and of his good wyll, & agayne of thyne towar∣de hym / for we neuer reade that the holye ghoste was gyuen to any man for workynge, but al∣way to them, that here the gos∣pell and mercye of Chryste & by∣leue
it, out of the whiche worde & none other thynge at this daye shulde faythe come forthe / for Chryste is the rocke, out of the which as Moyses sayeth / Deu∣teronomi. 3.2. butter and hony be sucked. ¶ The seconde cōmaun∣dement. LO hytherto we haue intreated of the fyrst cōmaundement / and that shortly, grosely, & in such hast / yt there may many mo thynges be spoken of them. Nowe therfore by the cōmaūde∣mentes ye folowe, we shall more largely seke these workes. Ther¦fore the seconde and next worke vnto faythe, is the worke of the seconde cōmaundement, that we
shuld honour the name of god, & not vse it in vayne / the which no more than all other workes can be done without fayth. For yf it be done without fayth it is vtter lye nought, but Ipocrysye, & an outward show. Next vnto fayth we cannot do a greatter thynge, than laude, set forth, synge, and by al maner of wayes extol, and magnyfye,The auc∣thor sayd be∣fore, yt there is no dyffe∣rence in wor¦kes, whiche he here decla¦reth more lar¦gely, & say∣eth nothyng but ye truthe and therfore mysreporte hym not, as manye haue done to ye cō∣dēnacyon of theyr owne conscyence. the laude, honour, & name of god / And though I say¦de afore (as it is true) that there is no dyfference in work{is}, where fayth is, and worketh, yet yt is to be vnderstonde whan the work{is} be cōpared to fayth / but compa∣rynge worke to worke, they ha∣ue dyfference, and one is hygher than an other, for as the mēbres of the bodye, as perteynynge to helthe, haue no dyfference, and helthe worketh aswell in one as
in another, and yet neuerthelesse the workes of the membres be dyuers & sondry / & one hygher nobler & more profytable than a¦nother / euen so here / to prayse the name and glorye of god / is better than the workes, of other cōmaūdementes, and yet it must no lesse than all other good wor∣kes procede, and be done, in the same faythe.He meaneth that it must be done with suche a sure faythe yt we byleue vn∣doubtedly yt god is there∣with all vt∣terly wel ple¦ased, & that he vnfay∣nedly enbra¦seth both vs & oure wor∣kes, for ye me¦rytes of chry¦stes blode, wherin and wherfore we make vs so assured. But I knowe that this worke is lytell made of / yea it is all vtterly vnknowen / ther¦fore lette vs loke vpon it more dylygently, content to haue say∣de, that this worke ought be do∣ne in faythe, and truste, yf it shal please god / ye forsothe there is noo worke / in the whiche thou shalte more euydentlye, or my∣ghtelye perceyue the vehemence of truste and faythe, than in the worshyppynge of goddes name.
And it is a wonderful helpe, bo∣the to then creasyng and stablys∣shynge of faythe, howe be it all good work{is} profyte to that pur∣pose. As sayeth saynt Peter in his .ii. epystle, the fyrst chapytre. Wherfore bretherne gyue ye mo∣re dylygence to make youre cal∣lynge and eleccyon sure by god∣des workes. AS the fyrste com∣maundement for∣byddeth vs to ha∣ue straunge god∣des / so it cōmaun¦deth vs to worshyppe the selfe same one and true god by fayth / truste, good wyll, hope, and cha∣ryte / whiche onely be the work{is}, wherwith we maye haue, wor∣shyppe, and serue god. For god can be nother obtayned nor loste
by any worke, but onely be fayth or vnbyleue / by truste or despera¦cyon. For there is no other wor∣ke that toucheth god / and so is forbyde in this seconde worke, yt we take not the name of god in vayne / The whiche yet is not ynoughe / but here is also com∣maunded / that we worshyppe / call vpon / preache & prayse his name. And truely it is not possy∣ble / but yt the name of god muste nedes be irreuerētly taken, whe∣re it is not reuerently worshyp∣ped. For all thoughe it be honou¦red with the mouthe / with knea∣lynge, with kyssynge, or with su∣che other gestures / yet yf it be not from the herte by faythe and truste in god, it is nothynge / but an outwarde shewe and coloure of ypocrysye and dyssymulacy∣on. Nowe take hede howe many
good workes a man maye do at all tymes in this cōmaundemēt, and neuer to be without ye good workes of this cōmaundement, yf he wyll, so that suerly he nea∣deth not to go farre of Pylgry∣mage / or vysyte holye places. And that to make more playne, shewe what momente or tyme, maye so soone passe ouer / in the whiche without any interrupcy∣on / we eyther receyue not good∣nes of god / or elles suffer yll ad∣uersytyes / and what other thyn∣ges be the benefytes of god, or aduersyties / but contynuall war¦nynges and prouocacyons / to laude, worshyp, and prayse god / and to calle vpon hym and his name / and so albeit thou be clea¦ne withoute all busynesse / haste thou not yet ynoughe to do, in this commaundement, to blysse,
prayse, laude, and worshyp god? for vnto what other purpose be ye tonge, voyce, sounde, & mouth made? as it is in ye psalme / lorde open my lyppes / and my mouth shall shewe forth thy prayse / Al∣so my lyppes shall prayse the. What worke is there in heuen / but of this seconde cōmaunde∣ment, as it is red in the .8.4. psal∣me. Lorde blyssed be they that dwell in thy house, for they shall prayse the for euer. So Dauid in the .33. plalme. his prayse is al¦waye in my mouthe / and saynt Paule to the Coryntheans / the fyrste Epystle the .10. chapyter / whyther therfore ye eate or dryn¦ke, or what soeuer you do, do all to the prayse of god / Also to the Collossyans the .3. chapytre. and all thynges, what soeuer you do in worde, or deade, do in ye name
of the lorde Ihesus Chryste, gy∣uyng thankes to god the father by hym. So that & yf we kepte this worke, we shulde here in er∣the, haue ye kyngdome of heuen, and we shulde haue ynoughe & enoughe to do, as haue the bles∣syd in heuen. FRom hence com∣meth the meruay∣lous & ryght iud∣gement of god, ye other whyles the nedy and poore man, whome no man regardeth / hath many and great workes with hym / and at home at his house by hym selfe, be other prayseth god merelye in his prosperyte / or elles calleth vpon hym in aduersytie / and in that, doynge a greatter & more acceptable worke / than another
that fasteth moch, prayeth, buyl∣deth churches, goeth pylgryma∣ges, and weryeth hym selfe hy∣ther and thyther with many wor¦kes. And so hence it commeth to this foole, that he gapeth & ga∣neth for suche great workes, so vtterly blynde, that he neuer ob∣serueth the other moste excellent worke of the poore man / so that to prayse god is but a lytell wor∣ke in his eyes, in comparyson of these great ymages, ymagened by his owne workes, in the whi∣che {per}aduenture he prayseth hym selfe more than god / or at ye least taketh more pleasure in theym than in god. And so by his good workes he resysteth the seconde cōmaundement of god and his workes. The publycane, and the Pharysie, that be in the gospell ben a fygure of all these. Where
the synner calleth vpon god in his synnes, and preaseth hym, touchynge the two hyghe com∣maundementes, faythe, and the honoure of god, but the Pha∣rysye accustomed to neyther of thyse bosteth hym selfe in other good workes, by the whiche he reioyceth not in god, but in hym self, trustynge more in hymselfe, than in god. Wherfore the one was worthelye reiecte, and the other chosen of god, ye which thī∣ge maketh all to this poynt, that the hygher & better, that the wor¦kes seme, so moche lesse they sta∣blysshe a mannes faythe. And to these euery man presumeth, that he maye easely do thyse workes, for we se that no man semeth so moche to prayse the name and glorye of god, as they whiche ne¦uer do it. So that when souer
the herte is without fayth, it cau¦seth the precyousnesse of the wor¦ke to be despysed. yea saynt Pau¦le doubteth not to saye playnlye that they dyde cheyflye blasphe∣me the name of god, whiche bo∣sted them selfe of ye lawe of god. For it is but an easye thynge to name / the name of god, or to pa∣ynte his honoure in paper or clo¦th, or vpon a walle / but to pray∣se hym from the herte / to thanke hym in his good gyftes, & bolde¦ly to call vpon hym in his aduer¦syties, Thyse trewelye be very selde, and the cheyfe of all wor∣kes nexte to faythe. In so mo∣che, that yf we myghte se howe fewe there be of these in Chry∣stendome, we myghte dye for so∣rowe. And yet in the meane ty∣me, thyse hyghe, fayre, and shy∣nynge work{is} inuēted by man, be
euer encreased, whiche ī dede out¦wardlye be lyke vnto these true work{is}, but within & in the groū∣de, they be without all fayth and truste and haue no goodnes in them at all. So the prophete E∣saye the .4.7. chapytre rebuked the people of Israell. Ye that be of the house of Iacobe yt be cal∣led Israell & haue come out of the stocke of Iuda, whiche do swere in the name of the lorde & god of Israel / ye remembre hym nother in veryte nor in truthe / yt is to say, they dyd these thynges nother in faythe nor truste, whi∣che is the true veryte and ryght∣wysenes / but they trusted ī theyr owne selfe, in theyr owne wor∣kes, and in theyr owne power, and yet they called vpon the na∣me of god and praysed it out∣wardelye, the whiche thynges
do agre to many nowe a dayes. WHerfore ye fyrste wor¦ke of this cōmaunde¦mēt, is to laude god for his benefyt{is} whi¦che be excedynglye many, in so moche that there ought to be no ceasynge or ende of suche laude or gyuyng of thankes. For who can prayse hym ynough, for this naturall lyfe, albeit I lette passe ouer all the temporall and euer∣lastynge goodnes that we maye receyue of hym? Thus is man o∣uer whelmed and heaped with good work{is}, by the onely begyn∣nynge of this commaundement, whiche yf he vse with true fayth he shall not be here Idle / Agayn this precept offende no men mo∣re than they that seme holy, that stande in theyr owne conceyte, yt gladly
Augustyne saythe, that all other vyces be done in yll workes, ex∣cepte desyre of honour and plea∣sure, whiche is done in and of good work{is}, wherfore yf a man haue no other thynge to do, but the seconde worke of this com∣maundement yet he hathe busy∣nes and laboure all his lyfe to stryue agaynste this vyce, it is so subtyll, obstynate, importuna¦te, and stryuynge agaynste hym that wolde cast it out. But now all these good workes set a par∣te, we excercyse our selfe in other vyler workes, ye rather we sub∣uerte and forget these right wor¦kes, by other workes only good by our owne iudgement. And so the holye name of god is take in vayne and vnreuerently coun¦ted, throughe our cursed name / pleasure, and desyre of honour,
whiche onely is to be honoured, and worshypped, ye which synne is more greuous in the syght of god, than other māslaughter or adulterye, but his poyson is not so clerelye sene, as be adulterye and manslaughter / for the hygh¦nes of it, for it is not cōmytted in ye grosse flesshe, but in ye spyryte. THere be some that thynke it profytable for youthe to exhorte and moue theym to do well and lyue well, by pray∣synge, honoure, and laude, a∣gayne to dyswade hym frome yll, by shame, and sclaunder. For there be many that do good for loue of honoure, and of prayse, and leaue yll, for feare of sclaū∣der / or els they wolde nother do the goodnes, nor leaue ye yll vn∣done / whome I leaue to theyr
owne iudgement. But we do serche howe good workes, shul∣de truely be done / to the whiche thynge who soeuer be redy they nede not to be moued, other by feare of shame, or desyre of ho∣noure / but they haue and ou∣ghte to haue a more nobler mo∣cyon, that is, the commaunde∣mentes of god / the pleasure of god, and theyr faythe and loue towarde god. They that haue not this mocyon nor care not for it / sufferynge theym selfe to be moued, by honoure, or laude, receyue theyr rewarde here. As Mathewe sayeth the .vi. cha∣pytre. And suche as is the mo∣cyon / suche be the worke and the rewarde, and neyther of them good but in the syghte of the worlde. I wolde iudge it as easye to vse and moue a yonge
man, by the feare and cōmaun∣dementes of god, and nothynge els, but whā this profyteth not / we muste neades suffre theym to good for prayse, and leaue yll for sclaunder / as we be boun∣de to suffre yll and vnperfytte men / of whom I speake be∣fore. There is nothynge that we shulde do more in this / but that we saye vnto theym / howe that theyr deade is not suffycy∣ent or ryght in the syght of god / so sufferynge theym to theyr owne maners, tyll they maye lerne to do well for god / as chyl∣dren be prouoked by gyftes and promyses of theyr fathers and mothers to faste, to praye, and to lerne, the whiche is not good to doo, thoroughe alle theyr lyfe, and neuer to lerne to do well for the feare of god, moche
more worse than is it, yf they be vsed to do well for prayse or ho∣noure. YEt neuerthelesse it is syttynge that we ha∣ue good name & pray¦se / therfore let euery man so shewe hym selfe, that there can no yll be spo¦ken of hym, nother that any man be offended in hym. As saynte Paule sayeth to the Romaynes, ye .xii. chapyter prouydyng good thynges, not onely before god, but before al men. And to the Co¦rynthians the .ii. epystle, and the iiii. chapytre. We report our sel∣fe to euery mannes cōscyence in the syght of god. But here is ne∣de bothe of great delygence and wysedome, lest that such honour and good name, shulde make vs
proude, & cause vs to haue loue and pleasure in them. For here procedeth the sayenge of Salo∣mon: as fyre dothe proue golde in the fournace / so a man is pro∣ued with ye mouthe of hym that prayseth hym. Therfore there cā be but fewe so hyghe and spyry∣tuall men, whiche cōtynewe fre, and vp ryght in such prayse and honour, settyng not by them, nor hauynge any pleasure in them / but wholy abydyng fre & voyde from all spyrytuall pryde / ascry∣bynge all theyr honoure & name to god onely, referryng to hym, what soeuer excellēce they haue / nother vsyng them otherwayes than to the glorye of god & the profyte of theyr neyghbours, & to nothynge lesse, than to theyr owne pryuate welthe and prero∣gatyue / so that they presume no∣thyng
of theyr honour nother be prowde of it, but can lyue as the most vylest & fylthest{is} of ye world But let thē knowlege thē self{is} to be ye seruaūtes of god / ye gyuer of such honor, to serue god & theyr neyghbour, none otherwyse thā yf he had cōmytted certayne of gold to thē to be distrybuted to ye poore people ī his name. So he sayeth Mathewe ye .v. chap. So let your lyght shyne before men yt they may se your good work{is} & prayse your father which is ī he∣uen / he sayde not yt they myghte prayse you but your work{is} & yet yt they myght serue to a more bet¦ter {pro}fyte yt by thē they may pray¦se god bothe in you & in thē. For this is ye true vse of good name & honour, whan god is praysed by them to ye profyte of other men. But suche men as wolde prayse
vs / & not god in vs & our dedes / let vs not suffre in any wyse, but forbydde & flye such prayse with all our myght & strength / as the most greuous of all synnes and robberye of the honour of god. HEnce it cōmeth, that many tymes by the sufferaunce of god, a man falleth in to gre∣uous synnes / and lyeth wrap∣ped in them, in so moche that he appereth a greuous synner as∣well in his owne syghte, as be∣fore other men, or els he coude neuer be saued, for the stoppe and lette of this excedynge vyce of vayne glorye, yf he shulde ne∣uer fall, but contynewe in great gyftes & vertues. For god muste withstande this synne, with o∣ther great synnes / that his holy name maye abyde in honoure.
So one synne is remedy & a me¦decyne for another / bycause of our frowarde malycious nature not onely doyng all yll, but also abusynge all goodnes. Nowe marke howe great busynes he hath, that wyll do good workes whiche come to his handes by great heapes / with the whiche whan he is compassed about on euery syde, and hath ynough cō∣maūded hym to do / yet (alas for sorowe) he seaketh and foloweth other after his owne mynde and wyll, & letteth them lye vndone / so yt no man can speke ynoughe agaynste this yll / nother exchue it ynough. With this synne had the prophetes moche to do / and were slayne / Chosen wor¦kes of mans owne fanta¦sye ben for∣bydden. for bycause they re∣iected and dampned such chosen workes, inuented and taken vp by mannes owne mynde / pre∣chynge
onely the cōmaundemen¦tes of god / of the which workes speketh Hyeremie the .vii. chapy¦tre / these thynges sayeth ye lorde of hoostes of Israell / put youre sacryfyce to your offrynges, and eate the flesshe / for I speake not with your fathers / nother com∣maunded them one worde of sa∣cryfyce and offrynges / that daye that I brought them out of the lande of Egypte / but this worde I cōmaunded theym, sayenge. Here ye my voyce, and I shal be vnto you a god / and you shal be vnto me a people, that is to say / here ye not that, whiche semeth ryght and iuste to you / but that which I haue cōmaūded you / & walke you in all the waye, whi∣che I so bydde you / yt you maye do well. And the .xii. chapytre of Deuteronomye / do onely to the
lorde, yt whiche I cōmaūde the, do thou nother put to, nor take awaye any thyng. These and in∣numerable such sentēces of scry∣pture be spoken to plucke a mā / not onely from synne, but also from the good and iuste workes of theyr owne opynyon / & onely to brynge theym by this playne sentence to goddes cōmaunde∣mentes / that they may greatlye regarde, and kepe theym onely. As it is sayd, Exodi the .xiii. cha∣pytre. It shall be as a sygne in thy hande, and as a remembraū¦ce before thy eyes / yt the lawe of god may be alway ī thy mouthe. And in the fyrste psalme / he shall muse in his lawe daye & nyghte / for we haue busynes ynoughe & more than ynoughe, to fulfyll the cōmaundementes of god. For he hathe gyuen vs suche cō∣maūde∣mētes,
yt yf we dyd vnder¦stande them / we shulde not true∣ly be ydell, the twynkelyng of an eye / and lyghtly forget all other workes. But the yll spyryte whi∣che resteth not vntyll he pulle vs on the lyfte hande, into yll wor∣kes / loketh ryghtly vnto these chosen and shynynge workes / a∣gaynste the whiche god cōmaun¦deth, Deuteronomie the .xxvii. and Iosue the .xxiii. chapytre. Be ye onely strong and busy, that you may kepe all thyn∣ges that be wryten in the boke of Moyses lawe, & do you not bowe from it, nother on the ryght han∣de, nor on the lyfte hande.
The thyrde worke of ye seconde com¦maūdemēt.THe thyrde worke of this cōmaundement, is to call vpō the na∣me of god in all try∣bulacyōs / for by this god iudgeth his name to be ha∣lowed, magnyfyed, & worshyp∣ped / yf we name hym, & cal vpon hym in persecucyon and necessy∣tie. And for to be shorte, this is the very cause why he dothe not onely punysshe vs with so many necessyties, suffrynges, persecu∣cyons, ye & dethe / but also suffe∣reth vs to lyue in many yll and synfull affeccyons / that by them he maye moue man to ronne to hym / to crye to hym, and to call vpon his holy name / and so to fulfyll the worke of the seconde cōmaundement, as he sayde the 4.9. psalme. Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble / And I shall
delyuer the, and thou shalte ho∣nour me. Offre to god the sacry∣fyce of prayse, and thou shalt ho∣noure me. And this is the waye, wherby thou mayst come to hel∣the. For by this worke a mā may perceyue & proue what the name of god is, howe myghty and full of power it is, to helpe thē that call vpon it / by the whiche spryn¦geth meruaylouslye truste and faythe / wherby the chiefe & fyrst cōmaundement is fulfylled / the whiche thynge Dauyd had pro∣ued whan he said the .53. psalme. I shall wyllyngly offre to the / & I shall prayse thy name, for it is good. For thou haste delyuered me from all trouble / and my eye hath loked ouer all my enemyes. And in the .90. psalme god sayth Bycause he hathe trusted in me, I shall delyuer hym, and I wyll
defende hym / bycause he hathe knowen my name. Nowe therfo¦re marke, what man there is in the worlde / that hathe not busy∣nes ynoughe all his lyfe / in this one worke / for who lacketh tem∣ptacyon, ye the space of one hou∣re? Albeit in the meane tyme I passe ouer, and speake in thynge of the temptacyon of troubles, whiche be infynyte. To this ad∣de that the moste peryllous tem∣ptacyon of all is this, whan the¦re is no temptacyō, nor trouble, but that al thynge gothe after a mannes mynde leste that he for∣gette god, and be the more cruell and mysuse this prosperyte and fortunable seasōs. yea here hath he ten tymes more neaed to call vpon ye name of god than in ad∣uersytye, as it is red the .90. psal¦me there shall falle a thousande
vpon thy ryght hāde. Moreouer we se clerer than the day, by day∣ly experyence of men, that there be more greuous vyces & syn̄es cōmytted in peace / in welthe of goodes, & in prosperous tyme,Cōtynu∣all prospe¦ryte is most daū¦gerous. than in warre, pestylence, sycke∣nes, & in al maner of troublous. In somoch that Moyses feared that his people shulde forsake ye cōmaundementes of god / for no other cause, but that they were more full sacyate / and quyete, than was expedyent, as he sayde Deutronomie the .32. chap. And Israell waxed corsye & kycked, waxed corsye, thycke & smothe / & let god go ye made hym & despy∣sed ye rocke ye saued hym, wherfo∣re almyghty god suffred hym to haue many other enemyes, who he wolde not put awaye, yt they shulde haue no rest, but excercyse
them selfe to kepe the cōmaunde∣mentes of god, as it is redde the .iiij. chapytre of Iudyth. Thus he handeleth and punyssheth vs with all maner of aduersytie / he is so carefull for vs, to dryue and teache vs to call vpon his name / to desyre faythe & truste in hym / and so to fulfyll two the fyrste cō¦maundementes. HEre therfore folys¦she men doo peryl∣lously / and specyal∣lye these holy wor∣kes, whiche chalen¦ge any syngularytie to them self, one lerneth to blysse hym selfe / ye other to defende hym selfe, with letters / some ronneth to char∣mers, prophesyers, and sothe say¦ers / this man seketh this, & this man that / & all that they myght
be safe without aduersytie. Ney¦ther can it be tolde howe myght lye the deuyls wytchecraftes rey¦gne agaynst this commaunde∣ment by charmynge and coniu∣ryng with superstycyous, which be all done for this cause / that they shulde haue no neade in the name of god. By ye whiche thin∣ges there is moche vnreuerence had to the two fyrste cōmaunde∣mentes, bycause that such thyn∣ges ben sought of ye deuyll, man, or other creature, which ought onely to be sought and foūde of god / by pure, playne, and bare faythe and truste, with a merye boldenesse / and by callyng vpon his holy name. Doste not thou thy selfe therfore fele at thy fyn∣gers endes, that it is a great fo∣lysshenes, to beleue the deuyll, man, and creature / and loke for
good thynges of them? And yet without suche faythe and truste in theym, it helpeth or profyteth nothyng to cal vpō them. What disceyte thā shal there be ī ye good & faythfull god? or what shulde let vs to trust & byleue of moche, yea and farre more in hym as in man or deuyll? Whan that god doth not onely promyse vs suc∣cour, and sure helpe, but sheweth it vs by al maner occasions, dry∣uynge vs to put such faythe and truste ī hym. Is it not a pyteous thynge, and to be bewayled, that the deuyll or man cōmaundyng no thynge nother compellynge, but only hyghtynge and promy∣synge shulde be set aboue god, whiche promyseth, compelleth, and cōmaundeth. Yea and more to be gyuen to the deuyl than to god? we maye well be ashamed /
yf we take but euen take exam∣ple of them that trust in ye deuyll or in man. For yf the deuyll (al∣though he be an yll and a lyenge spyryte (kepe his promyse with them that come in to his felow∣shyppe / howe moche more wyll god onely mekest and truest ke∣pe promyse with them that trust in hym? The ryche man trusteth and is bolde in his ryches, and money, and that profyteth hym and wyll not we truste and be bolde in the lyuynge god? that he wyll and maye helpe vs? it is a comon sayenge / ryches ma∣keth man bolde, and it is true. As Barucke wryteth the thyr∣de chapytre. Whiche treasu∣re vp syluer and golde / in the whiche men truste, and there is none ende of theyr gettynge. But he is moche more bolde
that is moued by the hyghe and euerlastynge good / in the which not men / but onely ye sonnes of god be bolde and trustye. BVt yf no suche ad∣uersyte or trouble dyd compell vs to cal vpon the name of god, & to truste in hym / yet onely synne is suffy∣cyent to exercyse and styre vs to this worke / for synne besegeth vs with thre stronge hoostes Of the whiche / the fyrst is, our owne flesshe. The seconde, the world, the .iii. the deuyl, by who∣me we be cōtynually prouoked, styred, and greued / for ye flesshe seketh pleasure and rest, ye world loketh for ryches / power and ho¦noure, the deuyll seaketh pryde, bostynge, and loue of hym selfe /
and despysyng of all other men / whiche be so myghty, that euery one of theym alone is stronge y∣nough to oppresse & ouercome a man, the whiche truelye we can neuer ouercome / but by callyng vpon ye holy name of god, in sted faste faythe. As Salomon sayth the .xviii. chapitre of the prouer∣bes. The strongest towre is the name of god / the ryghtous man ronneth vnto it, and he shall be lyfte vp / so Dauyd in the .115. psalme, I shall take the cuppe in the thākefull fyste, for ye helpe brought me, and I shall call v∣pon the name of ye lord. Also the .xvii. psalme: I magfyed and worshypped the lorde, & so was I saued frō my enemyes. These work{is}, & the power of the name of god, be vnknowen vnto vs / & that for bycause we haue not
vsed them, nor euer fought glad¦ly with our synnes, as thinkyng that we had no neade to call vp∣on the name of god. And this for¦tuneth bycause we be onely exer¦cysed in our propre workes, whi¦che we do by our owne power. ALso the workes of this com¦maūdement be / yt we shulde not swere, curse, lye, deceyue, & charme, by ye holy name of god nother exercyse any other mys∣uses, the whiche be so great that they be knowen vnyuersallye to all men. For these synnes be one∣lye (for the moste parte) preached and shewed in this commaunde¦ment / in the whiche is also com∣prehended that we shulde for∣bydde other men to swere, to lye, to deceyue, to curse, to charme, or by any other meanes to synne,
with the name of god, by ye whi∣che as there be many causes gy∣uen to do good deades / so there be to lette yll.The chye¦fe cūmaū¦demēt of this pre∣cept. But the chyefe and moost weyghtye worke of this cōmaundemente, is to de∣fende the holye name to god a∣gaynste all the spyrytuall mys∣uses. and to sette that forthe a∣monges all men. For it is not ynoughe that for my selfe and in my selfe, I prayse and call vp∣on the name of god as well in aduersytie as in prosperyte / but I muste neades shewe this na∣me for the, and lade my selfe with the hatered of all men for the glory of this name / as Chri∣ste said to his discyples, you shal be hated of al men for my name. Here we must dyseplease father, mother, & our best frendes, here we may withstāde our offycers,
and segnyours bothe spyrytuall and temporall, and we muste be rebuked as stubborne and dysobe¦dyent. Here the ryght and great lerned men, & they that seme ho∣ly with the all worldly men must be agaynst vs. And thoughe they be chyefelye bounde to do these thynges, to whome is cōmytted the chyefe of preachynge / yet eue∣rye Chrysten man is bounde to the same, whan tyme and place requyreth it / for we ought to pay and to gyue all that we haue or may do, for the name of god, and to proue in dede that the name, honoure, and laude of god is de∣rer to vs, than al other thyng{is}, & to truste in hym aboue all thyn∣ges / and to loke for all goodnes of hym, & so to professe hym that we take hym for ye hyghest good of al / and for whose name we be
redye to leaue and forsake all o∣ther thynges. HEere we muste with∣stande all iniuryes & wyckednesse, where as other the treuthe or ryght be in daun∣ger, or sufferyth vyolence, or ne∣cessyte. Neyther shuld be here ha¦ue respect to any {per}sone, as many men do, greatlye stryuynge for wronge done vnto the ryche my∣ghtye men, and to theyr frendes, but where as any suche thynges fortune to the poore and subiecte men, or to theyr ennemyes / they reste and let theym alone / suche men loke not vpon the name of god in them selfe, but throughe a paynted wyndowe measurynge the veryte and ryght after the re¦specte of persones. They fynde
neuer out theyr owne false eye, whiche loke more vpon the per∣sone than the cause. These be very flaterers and hypocrytes / hauynge no thynge to defende the truthe with / but clokynge and colouryng. For they knowe very wel that there is no ieoper∣dy to fauour the ryche, myghty, and connynge men, and theyr frendes, of whome they may re∣ceyue thankes, be defended, and honoured agayne. With suche easynes may a man withstande wronges done to bysshoppes, kynges, prynces, & other great men / for to helpe and defende theym, euery man stryueth to be beste. O howe preuye is this dis∣ceytfull Adam with his wytte / whiche goodlye cloketh the co∣uetousnes of his profyte with ye name of verytie, and uistyce, and
with the name fo god. But whā any suche thyng happeneth vn∣to a neadye or poore man / than this false eye fyndeth not so mo∣che profyte, thoughe he percey∣ue neuer so well, the hate of the ryche menne, and so forsaketh the poore manne, carynge for nothynge lesse / thanne to helpe hym that is in trouble. Who can nombre the multytude of this synne that is in Chrysten∣dome? So sayeth god, the .81. Psalme. Howe longe wyll ye iudge wronge fullye and take vppon you the face of vngod∣lye menne? Se that you dely∣uer in iudgement the poore and yonge fatherlesse / sette the trou∣bledde and oppressyd menne in theyr ryghte / auenge the poore forsakenne, and neadye / and to delyuere theym fromme the
handes of the vngodly. But for as moch as they do none of the∣se, it foloweth, that they nother knowe nor perceyue any thyng, but stycke in the respecte and per¦sones of men, that be of greate power, how vnryghtous soeuer they be, and knowe not the pore men, be they neuer so rightwyse. LO here myghte a mā do many god work{is}. For ye greattest parte of men of power, ry∣che men, & our frend{is}, do wrōge and exercyse vyolence, & tyrran∣nye, in the nedy, poore, and ad∣uersaryes. And ye geratter a man is, ye worse he is cōmenly. Wher¦fore there as thou canste not let such vyolēce, & helpe the truthe / yet shewe it in wordes, & nother assente nor fauour to ye vnryght¦wyse,
but speke ye truth playnly. For what I pray you, profyteth it a man to do all good workes, ronne to Rome, and to all other holye places / to buylde & founde churches and colledges, to pur∣chase all pardons, and yet fynde hym selfe fawty in the name and honour of god? bycause that his name beynge hyd / and suppres∣sed they set more by theyr owne goodes, honoures, and fauoure of theyr frendes / than they dyd by the truth / whiche is the name and verye honoure of god / yea what man is he / that hath not suche good workes, daylye and hourelye cōmynge home to his dores and house? that he nedeth not to ronne farther, or inquyre moche for good workes. For yf we wolde loke vpon the lyfe of man, and marke with how lytell
regard all thynges be done both here / and euery where / we shuld be compelled to crye with ye pro∣phete sayeng / euery mā is a lyer. Of a truth all men be false lyers & deceyuers / All men be lyers. for the cheyf true & pryncypall worke sette a parte, they garnysshe & paynt them sel∣ues / with the leste and vyle wor∣kes / and yet they wolde be coun∣ted good, and clym̄e to heuen with a sure quyetnes, and reste. But perauenture some man wyl saye, wherfore dothe not god helpe the pore alone, seynge that he knoweth & maye helpe euery mā? I answere that he knoweth and maye helpe and do it, but he wyll not do it alone / for he wyll worke togyther with vs / and by vs / But albeit we refuse to do hym this honoure. Yet ne∣uertheles / he wyll perfourme it,
helpynge the pore, & dampne su∣che with ye vnryghtwyse, as wyl not helpe theym, but despyse the great honoure of his worke, as men that fauoured the vnryght∣wyse. And albeit he be blyssed a∣lone, yet he gyueth vs the same honoure, bycause he wyll not be blyssed alone, but wyll haue vs blyssed togyther with hym. And moreouer yf god shuld do all the¦se thynges alone, his cōmaunde¦mentes shuld be gyuen in vayne no man hauynge a cause to exer¦cyse hym self, in the great work{is} of his preceptes. Nether shulde any man haue any sure profe or experyence, whether he trusted faythfully in the name of god or no,An innocēt lyfe, & good workes ben fyue tokens of a ryghte faythe. and allowed it for ye hyghest good that is or no. And whether that he wyll put hym selfe in all ieoperdyes for hym or no.
IT pertayneth also to this worke to re¦syste all false, per∣uerse / deceyuable erronyous doctry∣ne and heresyes / and all ye abuse of the spyrytuall and ecclesyasty¦call power, the whiche is a mer∣ueylouse hyghe thynge / for they straytelye withstonde the name of god / with the name of god / Wherfore it semeth to be greate Ieoperdye to gaynesaye them, whan they cloke theym selfes, sayenge. Who soeuer resysteth them, resysteth god and all his sayntes / whose stede they be in, and whose power they do vse, sayenge that it was spoken to them by Chryst. He that heareth you, heareth me / and he ye despy∣syth you, despysyth me / to the whiche word{is} they stycke styffely
and be fyerce & bolde to cōmaun¦de to do & leaue vndone what so euer they wyl / to excōmunycate, curse, take a waye, sleye / and do all other wyckednes, rebukes, & shames after their owne pleasur without any let, but Chryst dyd not thynke them to be obeyed in all thynge which they speake and do / but onelye whan they put forthe vnto vs the worde of the gospell, and not theyr owne worde / or elles howe shulde we haue knowen to auoyde theyr lyes and synnes? for we muste neades haue a rule, to shewe wherin they muste be obeyed & folowed / whiche rule muste be gyuen to vs not of them but of god, to the which we must order and vse our selfes / as we shall here in the fourth cōmaūdemēt. Thus therfore muste it be / that
in the spyrytuall degre / the more parte be false doctryne, prechyn∣ges, and the abuse of the Eccle∣siastycall power, to the ende that we maye haue cause and occasy∣on to do the workes of this com¦maundement, and that we shuld be proued / what we wyll do, or leaue vndone, for the honoure & glorye of god / agaynst the vn∣godlye blasphemers of hym and his name. O I wolde to god / that here we were as we oughte to be. Howe often than shuld the false offycyalles sette forth, both the popes and the bysshoppes ex¦cōmunycacyon in vayne? howe greatly then shulde ye thundryn∣ges of Rome / faynt and decaye? howe ofte shuld he holde his pea¦ce / whom all the worlde is cōpel∣led to here? howe fewe prechers shuld than be foūde in Chrysten¦dome.
But this myschefe hath so longe preuayled that, what soe∣uer they ordeyne muste be iuste and ryght. Here is no man that wyll stryue for the name and glo¦rye of god. Truely I byleue that there is no greatter syn̄e / nother more cōmytted by the outwarde workes / then in this cōmaunde∣ment. For it is hygher then that many can vnderstande and per∣ceyue it / and so ornate with the name and power of god / that it is ieoperdye to touche it. But the prophetes were ones chefe / craf∣te maysters in this thynge, and after theym / the Apostles / and specyallye saynte Paule nother regarded nor cared, whether the hyghe preest,As it appea¦reth ye .2. cha∣pytre to the Galatyens wher Paule rebuketh pe∣ter openlye, for his dys∣symulacion. or the lowe preest sayde it / whether he dyd it in the name of god / or that he dyd it in his owne name / for they marked
the wordes and the deades, and compared theym with the com∣maundementes of god / not lo∣kynge whether great Iohn̄ / or lytel Nycholas spake or dyd ey∣ther in goddes name or in man∣nes. And for this cause they we∣re put to deth / of ye which thyng, moche more / myght be spoken now in our tyme, wherin all thī∣ges be done out of frame. But Chryste & paule must hyde these thyng{is}, with theyr holy names, all though there can be no more shamfull a cloke of synne in the worlde / than the most holye and blyssed name of chryste Ihesu. Wherfore a man maye abhorre this lyfe / onlye for the abuse and blasfeme the holy name of god / And yf these thynge contynue any longer, I am a frayde leste, for god / they shall worshype the
deuyll. Our holy and spyrytuall men do all thyng{is} with suche ab¦homynable boldnes / and with∣oute any shame. Therfore it is hyghe tyme / that we praye herte¦ly to god / that he wyll sanctyfye his name. But ye muste be with the blode of them that sette in ye goodnes of martyres,He meaneth that we be saued by the worde, wher¦fore the mar∣tyrs shedde theyr blode. and whi∣che be gotten & saued with theyr blode. And euē they them selues must be martyres agayne / of the whiche thynge / we shall speake more an other tyme. ¶The thyrde cōmaundement. WE haue nowe seen howe manye good workes, be in ye se∣conde cōmaunde∣ment, of god / whi∣che be not good in them selues /
except they procede out of fayth / & trust of the loue of god toward vs / I wolde to god therfore we kept onely this cōmaundemēt so that we were not so occupyed & busye with other work{is} / that we vtterly forget this worke / nowe than foloweth ye thyrde cōmaun¦dement. Kepe thy sabboth day, ye thou sanctyfye it / as ye lorde thy god hath cōmaūded the / In the fyrst it is cōmaunded how yt our herte oughte to be byfore god in thoughtes. In ye seconde both in herte & also in mouthe with wor¦des. In this thyrde is cōmaun∣ded howe we shuld gyue our sel∣fes to god by workes / And this the ryght & fyrste table of Moy∣ses / in the whiche these thre cō∣maundemētes be wryten, rulyn∣ge man on the right syde / yt is to say / in suche thyng{is} as perteyne
vnto god / without the meane of any creature. The fyrste workes therfore of this precept be grosse & sensyble / which the most parte we cal diuyne seruyce, as to here masse, to pray, to heare sermons, vpon the holy dayes / & after this opynyon: there be but fewe good work{is} in this cōmaūdemēt. And yet thyse except they ron out of ye loue, grace, trust, & fayth of god / be nothynge at all as I sayd by¦fore. Wherfore it were wel yf the¦re were lesse holy dayes / in asmo¦che as now a dayes / the workes done in suche holy dayes ben cō∣monly worse than the workes of feryall or workye dayes by Idel¦nes, eatyng, drynkyng, playeng & such other yll ded{is}. Moreouer the masses be herde wtout any {pro}∣fyte, & the prayes sayde without any fayth. For ye most {per}te thus it
is / that we thynke we haue done ynoughe / whan we haue seen masse with our eyes / prayed wt our mouth / passynge ouer these thynges outwardlye, not thyn∣kynge that we shulde conceyue some thynge of the masse in to our hertes / that we shuld gette some lernyng out of ye sermōde / and that we shuld desyre / aske, and loke for some thynge in our prayers. Albeit here is ye great∣test faute of bysshops, & prest{is}, and of them to whome the offyce of preachynge is enioyned, in that, that they preache not the gospell, and teache not men / howe they shuld se masse, here sermondes / and praye / wherfore we wyll declare these thre workes in fewe wordes.
IN the masse it is necessarye / that we be there present in herte / How ye mas∣se oughte to be herde and what to be done thereat of ye hearers. & than be we present in her¦te / whan we exercyse faith in our herte, here we ought to nombre & weye the wordes of Chryst: wher¦by he ordayned ye masse, sayeng / Take & ete / this is my body whi¦che is gyuen for you / lykewyse ouer the cuppe / take and drynke of this all / this is ye cuppe of the newe Testament / in my blode / whiche for you and manye shall be shedde / so ofte as you shall do this / do it in the remembraunce of me. By thyse wordes / Chryste ordayned Diriges & yere myn∣des / daylye to be kepte for hym / throughe out all Chrystendome And made solempne, lawfull / ry¦che, and so great a testament / in the whiche he bequethed, no ren∣tes monye, or temporal goodes /
but forgyuenesse of all synnes, grace, mercye / and euerlastynge lyfe / that who soeuer come to these diriges / may haue this te∣stamēt. And vpon this he dyed / wherby this testamēt was made sure fyrme & stable, and neuer to be reuoked. And in a token of yt / in the stede of a wrytynge and seale / he hath lefte here his pro∣per body vnder breade and wy∣ne. Here nowe therfore is neade / that a man exercyse well ye fyrste worke of this cōmaundement / yt he doute nothynge: but that this is for a suertye, & that he suffer & byleue the testament to be certay¦ne vnto hym / lest he make chryst a lyer. For what other thynge is it / yf thou, standyng at the masse and nother thynke nor byleue / ye chryste hath bequethed & gyuen the / by his testamēt forgyuenes
syn̄es / than as yf thou shuld say, I knowe not or byleue not that it is true / that forgyuenes of all my syn̄es is here bequethed & gy¦uen vnto me. O how many mas∣ses ben there now in ye worlde? & how fewe that heare them / after this fayth & maner? wherby god is greuously offēded. Wherfore there is no man yt heareth masse profytablye / except other yt he be in aduersytie, temptacyons, and desyrynge ye grace of god / or els whiche wolde gladlye be rydde of his syn̄es, or els yf he be in an yll mynde, and yet chaūge it in the meane tyme / and attayne the desyre of the testament. And for this cause the cōmune and open synners, weare not suffered in tymes paste to come to masse. Therfore this faythe, goynge ryghte forthe after her maner / it
can not be / but the herte of man / made merye with this testament muste waxe hoote and melte in ye loue of god / and than foloweth prayse & gyuyng of thank{is} with a swete herte / vpon this in ye gre¦ke tonge / the masse is called Eu∣charistia / that is to say,Eucharistic. kyndnes or gyuynge of thankes / bycause we prayse god, & gyue hym than¦kes / for suche a comfortable, ry∣che and blyssed testamente, euen as he / whome a notable & fayth∣full frēde hath bequethed a thou¦sande poūdes or more / prayseth, gyueth thankes / and is merye. But it happeneth ofte tymes to chryste / as it doth to some other / whiche by theyr testament make them, that they bequethed vnto, ryche / whiche neuer after remem¦bre them / nother praysynge nor gyuynge vnto them thank{is}. So
be our masses done nowe a day∣es / yt we in the meane tyme / no∣ther know nor be sure what they profytte vs / or wherfore they be done / which thynge is the cause / that we nother praysyng, nother gyuyng thankes / nor dylygent / but drye and harde, contynue at masse / content with our owne prayers & small deuocyons / of the whiche I shall speake more an other tyme. PReachyng shuld be none other thynge / Preachyng. but the declarynge of this testamente / but who can here, whan no man dothe preache? for now truely they vnderstond not this testament / whose duty it is to preache it / & prechynges also for the most parte go a brode / &
at large into tryfelyng tales no∣thyng worth / & so whyles Christ is forgotten / it happeneth to vs as it dyd to them in the .iiii. boke of kyng{is}, the .vii. chapytre / thou shalte se / and therof thou shalte not eate / bycause that we seynge our good, do not vse it / of ye whi∣che speketh Ecclesiastices. This is a great myschyefe, ye god hath gyuen ryches to man / whiche he suffereth hym not to vse. So we se innumerable masses, and yet ignoraūte in ye meane tyme whe∣ther the masse be a testament or no / or rather some other thynge / as though it were a good worke by it selfe.The masse is no good worke of it selfe, that is to wytte, it {pro}fyteth not whan it is herde or said without the faythe ther∣unto, neces∣sarely reque¦syte, & this is thauthors mynde. O good lorde / howe vtterly blynded be we? But whe¦re as this thyng is well preched / it muste neades be delygentlye harde, receyued, ofte tymes spo∣ken of / and so shall the faythe be
strengthed agaynste tēptacyons of synnes, past, presēt, & to come. Lo this is the onelye ceremony, & the onely exercyse ordayned of Chryst / in ye whiche we ought all to be gathered togyther, come to¦gyther, exercysed, and be agreed. The which ceremony is not yet, as other bare ceremonyes ben / but he hath put in it an excellent ryche treasure / to be delyuered & gyuen to all thē yt byleue in this testament / with such preachyng shulde the synner be prouoked / that he beynge sorye for his syn∣nes / may be kyndell with the de∣syre of this treasoure / therfore it is a great synne of thē, that here not the gospell / and regarde not suche treasoures, and so ryche a feaste / to ye which they be called / but it is a greatter synne not to preache the gospell, and to suffre
so manye people / desyrous to here the gospell, to peryshe, not∣withstandynge the strayte com∣maundemente and ordenaunce of Chryste to the cōtrary whiche wyll no masse to be done / but that euen than the gospell also shuld be preached / The gospell oughte to be preached at euery masse. as he hymsel∣fe sayde / so ofte as you shall do this / you shall do it in my remē∣braunce / wherfore it is a fearful and abhomynable thynge / to be a bysshope / a curate / a parysshe prest / or a precher nowe adayes / for there is no man yt lesse kno∣weth this testamente I tell not, howe fewe there be that preache it. And yet this is theyr specyall offyce and onelye duetye / Howe harde accompte / therfore shall they make for so many sou∣les lost / for the lacke of suche preachynges.
WE must praye / Prayer. not as it is cōmenlye vsed, to mūble vp manye leaues, or bedestones, but to take in our handes some present troubles / and handel them with all our desyre, and in them to ex∣ercyse oure faythe and truste to∣warde god / that we doubte not but that we shall be harde.Saynt Ber¦narde. So saynt Bernarde taught his bre∣therne to praye, sayeng / dere bre¦therne despice not your prayers / for I tell you for a truthe byfore you haue ended youre wordes, your prayer is wryten ī heuen / & one of these two / may you be su∣re of vpon god / that ones youre prayer shall be fulfylled / or yf it be not fulfylled / it shulde not be for your {pro}fyte / that it were ful∣fylled. So is prayer, a synguler
exercyse of the fayth / which fay∣the maketh the prayer so accep∣table to god / that other it shal be fulfylled / or els better shall be gy¦uen thā is asked. So sayd saynt Iames / By Iames wordes eue∣ry man may perceyue the great force & strengthe of a sure fayth. yf any that is amonge you lacke wysdome / let him aske of god, which gyueth to all men abundantly / and casteth no man in the tethe with his benefyces, & it shalbe gyuen hym / but let hym aske in fayth and wauer not / for he that doubteth is lyke the wa∣ues of the see, toste of the wynde and caryed with vyolēce / nother let that man thinke, that he shall receyue any thynge of god. Is not this a playne and clere sen∣tence / as it {pro}myseth to hym that byleueth / He that by∣leueth not re¦ceyueth no benefyte. so it denyeth to hym that byleueth not, that he shall nother obtayne that whiche he desyreth, nor no better. And to
sturre vp this same fayth / Christ hym selfe said. Marke ye .xi. chap. Therfore I say vnto you / what soeuer you desyre whā you pray / byleue yt you shal haue it, & it shal be done vnto you. And Luke the xi. And I say vnto you / aske & it shal be gyuē you / seke & you shal fynde / knocke and it shall be ope¦ned vnto you / for euery mā that asketh, receyueth / and he that se∣keth, fyndeth / and to hym that knocketh, shall it be opened / yf ye sone axe breade (sayeth Chryste) of any of you whiche is his fa∣ther / wyll he profre hym a stone? or yf he aske fysshe / wyll he gy∣ue hym a serpent? yf ye than whi¦che are euyll / knowe howe to gy¦ue good gyftes vnto your chyl∣dren / how moch more, shall your father celestyal gyue a good spy∣ryte to them yt desyre it of hym.
WHo is so herde or so stonye, whan suche myghty and stronge word{is} can not moue to pray merely and boldely with all truste? But nowe how many prayers were it nede to reforme, yf we shulde praye a ryghte? Be not al churches and abbeys full and replenysshed with prayers and songes? And howe is it, that there cōmeth so lytell profyte of them? Yea that it is euery daye worse and worse? Certeyse there is no other cause, but that that saynt Iames sheweth, sayenge / ye aske, and ye receyue not / be∣cause ye aske it euyll / for yf this truste & faythe in prayer wante, the prayer is deade / & nothynge elles, but a paynfull labour and werynes / for ye which, yf there be any thynge gyuen / it is nought
but temporall profyte / without any good helpe of the soule / yea rather they be great hurtes and blyndynges of the soules / in the whiche they procede, mumblyng moche with the mouthe / not re∣gardynge to trust to obtayne yt, whiche they desyre / and so they cōtynue styffelye in suche vnfay∣thefulnes / as in most the worste custome that can be agaynst the vse of faythe / and the nature of prayer. Wherof whiche that fo∣loweth / that he that preacheth truelye / doubteth not, but that his prayer is for a suretie accep∣ted & harde / yea thoughe he ob∣tayne not that, that he desyreth. For in oure prayer we may sette our trouble before god, but yet we can appoynte hym no maner of measure, meane, ende, marke, or place to helpe vs / but permyt
all vnto hym / whiche wyll gyue other that / or better than we can ymagyne or thynke / As saynte Paule sayeth to the Romaynes, the .viii. chapytre / & to the Ephe∣sianes the .iii. chapytre. And god worketh more profoundely and better / than we perceyue and vn¦derstande / so that there muste be no doubte, but that the prayer is herde and accepted. Prouyded alwaye that the tyme, place, ma∣ner and ende, be fre to god / whi∣che knoweth beste howe to ende the mater / as it is moste conue∣nyent. These be the trewe wor∣shyppers / which worshyp the fa¦ther in spyryte & truthe. For who¦soeuer byleue not theyr prayer to be herde, do synne vpon ye lyft hande, agaynste this cōmaunde∣ment, bowynge to moche from it by vnbyleue. But they that sette
god a marke or measure, synne vpon ye ryght hande, cōmyng to nyghe by temptyng of god. But god hathe forbyden / yt we shulde swarue from his cōmaūdement, eyther vpon the ryght hande, or vpon the lyfte hāde / that is, that we shuld not synne, nother by vn¦byleue, nor by temptyng of god / but abydynge in the playne and streyght waye of fayth / we shuld truste in hym / & not set hym any terme to helpe vs. SO we se, yt as the se∣conde commaunde∣ment / so this ought to be nothynge els, but the exercyse and workynge of the fyrst cōmaundement / that is to say, of faythe, truste, bolde∣nes, hope, and loue toward god / so that the fyrste cōmaundement
is the ruler and captayne in all the other cōmaundementes / and fayth is ye chyefe worke & lyfe of all other workes / without ye whi¦che (as it is sayd before) they can¦not be good. But and yf thou wylte saye / what and I can not byleue that my prayer is harde & accepted / I answere specyallye for that cause / faythe, prayer, & all other good workes be com∣maunded, yt thou mayste knowe what thou canste do / and what thou canste not do / but & yf thou fynde thy self, that thou can not byleue and do / than do thy dyly∣gence, to humble thy selfe before god / makynge thy complaynte, and begynnynge, in this weake sparkyll of fayth / stablysshe and comforte it euery daye more and more / by vse in all thy lyfe, and in al thy workes. For there is no
man in the worlde, whiche lac∣keth not a great parte of faythe / that is of the fyrst and chyefe cō∣maundement. Yea the holy apos∣tels in the gospell / and specyally saynte Peter, were weake in the faythe / so yt they prayed Chryste sayenge. Lorde increase fayth in vs / and he also rebuked theym / bycause they had weake faythe. Therfore thou oughtest not to dyspayre / leuynge as they saye (hande & foote) whan thou per∣ceyuest that thou byleuest not so stronglye in thy prayer or other workes / as thou oughtest and wolde / yea than thou oughtest to thanke god, with all thy hert / that he hathe shewed thy weake¦nesse vnto the / teachynge & war∣nynge the by that / howe necessa∣rye it is for the to exercyse & day∣ly stablysshe thy selfe in faythe.
For howe manye doste thou se / fastynge, prayeng, syngynge, re∣dynge, workynge, shynynge, as thoughe they were meruaylous holy & good / and yet neuer com∣mynge so farre, that they knowe howe yt faythe is ye chyefe worke of all other / wherby they be blyn¦ded & deceyued / both them selfes and other / also thynkynge them selfes well ynoughe & buyldyng vpon the grauell of theyr owne workes without all faythe. And not trustyng vpon ye fauour and {pro}myse of god by sure & pure fay∣the. And thus thou seest that we haue ynoughe to do all our lyfe / to do ye work{is} of the fyrst cōmaū¦dement & fayth, euer lernynge & contynueng scolers / for no man knoweth, howe great a thyng it is, to byleue onely in god / but he that begynneth to practyse it.
NOwe se agayne / yf there were no other worke cōmaunded / than prayer, were it not only ynoughe to exercyse in faythe, all the tyme of mans lyfe? for the which purpo∣se specyally were ordeyned holy ordres / & in tyme past, some holy fathers prayed bothe nyght and daye / yea there is no man at all, but yt he hath to pray at al tymes without ceasyng. But I speake of spyrytual prayer / yt is no man is so payned with his labour (yf he wyll) but he may also speake to god in his herte / and sette be∣fore hym, other his owne trou∣bles, or other mens / prayenge & besechyng for helpe / & in al these exercyse & strēgth his faythe / for this is it that oure lorde wolde. Luke ye .18. sayeng we must pray
without ceasynge / all thoughe Mathewe the .vi. he forbyd ma∣ny wordes and longe prayers / in the which he rebuked ye Pha∣ryseis and hypocrytes / not that vocall & longe prayers be euyll / but that it is not the true prayer whiche muste be done alwaye / & which without ye inward prayer of faythe, is nought worthe / for ye outwarde prayer must be vsed also at tymes / specially at masse, as it is requyred by this cōmaū∣dement / and not onely than, but also at any other tyme where so∣euer it shall {pro}fyte to thynwarde prayer & fayth / whether ye be at home, in ye fylde, or in any other worke. Wherof nowe it is no tyme to speake more / for it {per}tay∣neth to ye Pater nr̄ / in the whiche al peticyons & vocall prayers be comprehended in short wordes.
WHere be they nowe yt desyre to knowe and do good wor∣kes? What soeuer they be, let thē set onely prayer before them / & they shall fynde this trewe / that holy fathers haue sayd / there is none so great labour, as it is to pray / it is but a lyght thyng to mum∣ble with thy mouthe / Here haste thou descry∣bed whatte true prayere is. but to put out the wordes sadlye with thy herte, with inwarde godlynesse, and deuocyon. That is with de∣syre & faythe, that the herte may ernestly aske that thynge / that ye wordes pretend / doubtynge not but that it shall be herde. This truely is a good worke in ye sight of god / and to let this, the deuyll stryueth and wrasteleth with all his myght. O howe ofte wolde he let our pleasure in prayenge /
& suffre vs nother tyme nor pla∣ce / yea ofte tymes make vs dys∣payre / whether a man be worthy to praye to so hyghe a maiestye as god is / & so prouoke man, yt he can not tel / whether that it be in erneste or no that he prayeth / whether it be possyble / that this prayer be accepte or not / & many such other thoughtes, cast the de¦uyll to vs / for he knoweth howe myghty, stronge, & profytable to all men / is the prayer of a fayth∣full man. Wherfore he wold not gladly suffre vs to praye. Here a man muste playe the wyse man / & not for this cause to dyspeyre / yt other our selfes or our prayers be vnworthy in the syght of the excedynge maiestye of god / nor to laboure by his owne worthy∣nesse / nor to lyue by this vnwor∣thynesse / but we must marke the
cōmaundement of god, and laye that agaynste hym / and to pre∣uente the deuyll / sayenge as I wyll begynne nothynge by my owne worthynesse / so I wyll o∣mytte nothyng for myne vnwor¦thynesse. For I do onely praye & worke for this / yt god of his pu∣re mercye & grace, hath {pro}mysed hearynge and grace to all men / thoughe they be vnworthye / yea he hathe not alonly {pro}mysed / but also most ernestly cōmaūded vn∣der the payne of his euerlastyng indygnacyō & angre / to praye, to be bold, & to receyue. If therfore it was no lytel thyng to so hygh a maiesty / to bynde so greatly su¦che his vnworthye wormes / to pray, to trust ī hym, & to receyue of hym / howe shulde it be a lytel thīg to me / to take such a cōmaū¦dement wt all ioye / whether I be
worthy or vnworthy? Thus the suggestyon of the deuyll / muste be ouerthrowen, by the cōmaun∣dement of god / for so wol he lea∣ue vs, or els neuer. The causes and necessy∣tyes yt shuld moue vs to praye.BVt what be ye cau∣ses & necessyties / yt shulde be put and complayned vpon to almyghtye god in prayer / to exercyse faythe? I answere fyrst of all / ben pryuate troubles, temptacyons, and ad∣uersyties of a mans owne / of the whiche speaketh Dauyd the .31. psalme. Thou arte my defender from trybulacyon, thou shalt ke∣pe me / and make me glade exce∣dyngly for my delyueraūce. Also the .141. psalme. I cryed vnto the lorde / before ye lord I fell downe and made my prayer / before him
I powred forth my heuy medy∣tacyon / before hym I layde my strayte anguysshe. So ought a chrysten man to remembre hym selfe before masse / what he thyn∣keth what he lacketh, or what he hathe to moche / & to powre that frely out before god, wepynge, mournynge, syghynge / and that as pyteously as he can / as befo∣re his most trustye father & most redy to helpe hym. But and yf thou nother knowe, nor {per}ceyue thy necessyties / or yf thou lacke temptacyon, or persecucyon / thā thynke thy selfe in an euyll case. For this is the greattest perse∣cucyon / yf thou fele thy selfe / so blockysshe, so herde, so dull, that thou arte moued by no persecu∣cyon. There is no better glasse / The glasse, in the which we maye se our necessy∣ties, is the cō¦maundemēt of god. wherin thou mayste beholde thy necessyties / than the .x. cōmaun∣dementes
of god / in the whiche thou mayste fynde, what thou wantest, & what thou oughtest to seke / and so thou shalte fynde in thy selfe weake faythe / sclen∣der hope, lytel loue toward god / and that thou dost nother prayse nor worshyppe hym / but louest thyne owne prayse and bostyng, and settest moche by the fauour of men / not glad to here masse, and sermons / slow to praye, in whiche thynges, euery man fay∣leth and dothe amysse / Suche defautes, thou oughtest to re∣garde more, than all corporall damages / of fame, of honoure, or of body, in so moche that they are more to be sorowed, thā deth it selfe, or all bodelye dyseases. Whiche all thou oughtest to lay before god with reuerēce, feare, and faythe, complaynynge and
cryenge for helpe, with all trust / lokynge surelye to be herde, and that he wyll graunt the socoure and grace. And of this facyon, goynge further in the seconde table of the cōmaundementes of god / take hede howe dysobedy∣ent thou haste ben / and yet arte, to thy father and mother, to the offycers, and superyours / howe thou haste offended thy neygh∣bour with angre, hate, and chec∣kes / howe that wantones, coue∣tyse, & vnryghtwysenesse hathe tempte the / bothe in worde and dede / and than without doubte, thou shalte fynde thy selfe ful of trouble and myseryes / that thou shuldest haue cause ynoughe (yf thou myghtest) to wea∣pe teares of blode.
BVt I knowe many, that be so folysshe, yt they wyll not praye and desyre suche thynges, before they fynde theym selues cleane / thynkynge that god hea∣reth none yt is in synne / the whi∣che thyng all togythers false pre¦chers haue made / whiche teache that we muste begynne / not at the grace of god and faythe / but at our owne workes. Nowe be∣holde thou wretched man / yf thy legge be broken / or yf thou be brought in to any other bodelye ieoperdye / thou callest vpon god or vpon this saynte or that / and taryeste not vntyll thy legge be hole or thy ieoperdy be past. No∣ther arte thou so folysshe, ye thou wyll thynke, that no man shalbe herde that hath a broken legge / as in ieoperdy of dethe. Yea thou thynkest than to be moste specy∣allye
herde of god / whan thou arte in most ieoperdye & sorowe. Wherfore thā art thou so folys∣she here / where is moste necessy∣tye and greattest hurt / that thou wylte not fyrst praye / for faythe, hope, loue, humylytie, obedyēce, chastetye, gentylnes, peace, and ryghtwysenesse / before thou be without all vnbyleue, wātones, couetyse, and vnryghtwysenes / whā that the more thou fyndest thy selfe a synner ī these thyng{is} / the more largelye thou oughtest to praye and call to god. We be so blynde, that ī bodely troubles & synnes we ron vnto god / but in the syckenes of our soules we ronne from hym, not wyllyng to come to hym, except we be hoole & perfyte before / as though god were not alwaye one in helpyng the body & ye soule / or as though
we coulde helpe our selfe in spy∣rytuall trouble / which is great∣ter than bodelye dyseases, in the which we can not helpe our self. This is a deuelysshe counsell & purpose. Therfore (O man) do not so / for yf thou be wyllyng to be helped of thy synnes / thou must not withdrawe thy selfe frō god / but moche more boldelye ronne & preyse vnto hym / thā yf bodely trouble & {per}secucion come vpō the.God refu∣seth no man but if he refu¦se hym fyrst by vnfayth¦fulnesse. For god is no enemy to syn̄ers / but to vnfaythful / ye is to them ye knowlege not theyr syn∣nes, & wyl not cōplayne & seke to god for helpe, but of theyr owne pryde & presūpcion fyrst do pur∣ge theym selfes / as men yt wyll not stāde nede of his grace / & as men, not sufferyng god to be wt thē / which gyueth to al men fre∣ly, & receyueth nothyng agayne.
ALl these thynges be spoken of ye prayer, both for thyne owne trouble & also for cō∣mon trouble / but prayer proper∣ly pertaynyng to this cōmaūde∣ment,To this cō∣maundemēt {per}tayneth cō¦men prayer, for all chry∣stendome. is called the worke of the holy day / moch better & greatter to be done for al chrystēdome for ye troubles of al mē / for enemyes & frend{is}, specyally for them ye be ī euery mans parysshe or dyoc{is} / & so sayd saynt Paule to his dyscy¦ple Timothe, in his fyrst epystle the .ii. chapytre sayeng, I exhort therfore ye aboue al thyng{is} pray∣ers, supplycacyons, peticyons, & gyuynge of thankes / be had for all men / for kynges & for al that are had in prehemynence / ye we may lyue a quyete and peasable lyfe in all godlynesse and ho∣nestye / for yt is good & accepted
in the syght of god our sauyour. And Heremie the .xxix. chapytre / he cōmaunded the people of Is∣raell to pray to god for the cytie, and for the coūtrey of Babylon / bycause that the peace of Baby∣lon, was theues also. And Ba∣ruche the fyrst chapytre. Praye you for the lyfe of Nabugodono for kynge of Babylon, and for ye lyfe of Balthasar, his sone / that theyr dayes may be as the dayes of heuen vpon erth / and that the lorde wolde gyue vs vertue and lyghte our eyes / that we may ly∣ue vnder the shadowe of Nabu∣godonosor kynge of Babylon / & vnder the shadowe of his sone Balthasar / & that we may serue them many dayes, and fynde fa∣uour in theyr syghte. This com∣mune & publique prayer is most precyous and effectuous, for the
whiche also we come togyther. Also vpon this the temple is cal¦led the house of prayer / that the∣re all togyther we shulde set our eyes / bothe vpon our owne trou¦ble / and the trouble of all other, and shewe theym vnto god / cal∣lynge for grace. But this must be ernestlye done / and whiche trewe compassyon that we mo∣ued by suche trouble and euyll of al men / and by clere petye vp∣on them / we may praye for them in true faythe and truste. Where therfore such prayer, is not done at masse / it were surer and better not to be at masse.Agaynst pri¦uate pray∣ers. For how doth it agre / that we come boldely all togyther in the house of prayer / wherby is sygnifyed, ye we shuld inuocate & praye openlye for the vnyuersall cōpanye of all fayth∣full people / & in the meane tyme,
we so scatter & deuyde our pray∣ers / ye euery mā prayeth only for hym selfe no mā caryng or busye for other / nother pyteynge other mens trouble / howe thā can this prayer be called {pro}fytable / good, acceptable, cōmon, or ye worke of ye holy day, & cōmyng togyther / as they make it / whā euery man kepeth his owne propre prayer / this mā prayeng for one thyng / & yt for another / hauyng nothīge but prayers / seruynge for theyr owne priuate {pro}fyte, whiche god hateth. OF this cōmon prayer, after the olde custome / is this ar¦gument left vs / yt in ye ende or in some other tyme of the ser∣monde,We haue a tokē yet left in the church of the cōmen prayour. is the beades rehersyd / & they pray for al chrystendome / & the cōpanye there gathered to∣gyther. But they shulde not lyue
here as though ye matter were en¦ded, as the maner & vse is now / but there ought to be a warnyng yt they shulde pray all ye masse ty∣me / for such troubles as ye {pre}cher shall put vs in remēbraūce yt we be indaūgered to. And yt we may pray worthely / he warneth vs be¦fore of oure synnes, to make vs lowe / which must be don wt fewe word{is}, yt the people may al togy¦ther by thē self, shew theyr syn̄es to god / so prayeng ī fayth for all men / euen frō ye hert. Oh, I wold to god yt some cōpany myght he∣re masse & pray after this maner, ye openly & in ye cōpany myght a∣ryse a clere crye frō ye hert, & ascē∣de to god / howe inestymable ver¦tue & helpe shulde folowe of such a prayer / what thynge may be more fearefull to all euyll spyry∣tes? what greatter worke can be
done in the worlde / by the which so many good men maye be pre∣serued, and so many synners cō∣uerted? for the congregacyon of Chryst in erthe / hathe no great∣ter power or greatter worke / thā suche open and cōmen prayere / agaynst al aduersytie / that may happen vnto it. And that the de∣uyll knoweth well / & therfore he goeth about to lette this prayer. Here he suffereth vs to buylde goodly churches / to founde ma∣ny chauntryes / to blowe & playe vpon ye organs, to rede, to syng, to saye many masses / and to ex∣ercyse innumerable suche other ceremonyes, whiche he feareth not / yea he so furthereth theym / that we iudge suche for the best / and thynke the mater is wel en∣ded with suche worshyppynge. But amonges all these, whan
this cōmon stronge and profyta¦ble prayer is subuerted / & by this maner letten alone / he hath that he wolde. For this prayer layde asyde or banysshed awaye / no man can take any thinge fro the deuyll, or stryue agaynst hym. But he wyll watch yf we vse a∣ny suche prayer / Yea and yf it be in our cotage, or poore thackyd house / truely he wyl not suffre it (yf he maye) to procede / but fea∣reth it, moche more / than all the hyghe, great, & godly churches / towres, bell{is}, where soeuer they be / yf there be no suche prayer in them: truely it maketh no mat∣ter, in what places or buyldyng{is} we come togyther / but all the pythe is ī this inuyncyble pray∣er / that we all vnyuersally do it well / & that we care that it may come to god.
The vertue of a deuoute & faythfull prayer.WE may coniecture ye myghte & power of this prayer / vp on this / that Abra¦ham prayed vs for the fyue cyties / Sodoma, Go∣mor. &c. And he preuayled so mo¦che, that yf there had ben tenne ryghtwyse men in theym / that is in euery one of theym two / god wolde not haue dystroyed them. What than shall be done by this prayer / where many in one con∣gregacyon / and trustynge in the true god / cal hertely vpon hym / as saynt Iames sayeth / pray ye one for another, that ye may be healed / the prayer of a ryghtwy∣se man auayleth moche yf it be feruent / that is to saye / not lea∣uynge to praye more and more / yea thoughe he obtayne not by and by that, that he asketh / as
do some men that be weake spy∣ryted / of the whiche he bryngeth an example and sayeth. Helyas was a man in daunger to try∣bulacyon, as we are / & he prayed in his prayer / that it myghte not rayne / and it rayned not on the erthe, by the space of .iii. yeres & syxe monethes / and agayne he prayed, and the erthe broughte forthe her fruyte. There ben ma∣ny such sayenges and examples mouynge vs in scrypture. But yet this prayer muste be done wt grauyte, faythe, & from ye herte / as sayeth Dauyd / the eyes of ye lorde be vpon ryghtwyse men / & his eares vpon theyr prayers. And also the lorde is nyghe vn∣to theym / that call vpon hym / to all that call vpon hym in truth / why dyd he adde to theym / that call vpon hym in truthe? bycau∣se
yt there is nother prayer nor in¦uocacyon / where ye mouthe one∣lye mumbleth.The onelye mumblynge with ye lyp∣pes is no prayer. What than wyll god do with the / whan thou cō∣mest with thy boke, with thy mouthe, with thy beades / & thyn¦kest no other thynge / but yt thou mayste ende thy prayer and ful∣fyll thy nombre? so that yf thou be asked what was the cause / or wherfore thou purposedest to pray / thou knowest not thy self / nother dyddest thou consydre or regarde to put forth this or that vnto god / or to aske any thynge of hym. This is the onely cause / that this & so many prayers be inioyned vnto the / this wylte thou keape and no more. What meruayle therfore is it / that the churches be ofte tymes set a fyre with lyghtenynge and thundre from heuen / Churches set a fyre. seynge that of the
house of prayer / we make ye hou∣se of mockynge and yllusyone? shall we saye that we praye / whā we nother set forthe any thyng, nor aske any thynge. But we shulde do as they do / that aske any thyng of a greatter prynce / whiche do not onely purpose to clatter with the mouthe manye word{is} / (for than ye prynce wolde thynke that they mocked hym / or yt they were madde) but they that shall go vnto such prynces / consyder theyr matter well be∣fore, and declare well and dyly∣gentlye theyr trouble / and yet they permytte all to his grace / trustyng that they shalbe herde / so muste we do with god / with a sure and indoubted accyon / ex∣pressynge some troubles by na∣me / shewynge thē by his fauour and good wyll / doubtynge no∣thynge
but yt we shall be harde / for he hathe promysed yt he wyll here suche a prayer, the whiche no other erthely god hathe pro∣mysed. WHan we be lette with bodely trouble / than we knowe {per}fyghtlye this maner of pray∣er. For whan we be taken with syckenesse / we call vpon saynte Chrystofer in this place / & saynt Barbara in that place. Here we vowe to saynt Iames, there to a nother saynt. Than praye we wt herte and mynde / than is oure truste good / and al the condycy∣ons of prayer requisyte ben pre∣sent. But whan we come in to ye churche to masse, we stande lyke ymages / and can remembre no∣thyng / nother shewe or cōplayne
any thynge / there our beade sto∣nes maketh a noyse, and our lea¦ues sounde / & our mouth mum∣bleth, & nothyng els do we. And yf thou wylt aske, what thynge thou shuldest put forthe or com∣playne of / yf thou be not lerned, open thy eyes, and loke vpō thy lyfe / and the lyfes of other chry∣sten men / & specyally of the state of the spyrytualtie / & thou shalte than fynde, howe yt faythe, hope, charytie, obedyence, chastytye, & to be shorte / all other vertues be banysshed / and all maner of vy∣ces nowe reygne. Thou shalte se howe great a lacke is of good prechers / howe yt there be none that rule, but vayne persones, women, boyes, and foles. Than thou shalte fynde, that it is ne∣cessary for all ye worlde to praye euery houre with blodye teares /
that this excedyng indygnacyon of god, cease / for this is true / yt it was neuer more nede of pray∣er than nowe, and shall be here∣after to the worldes ende. Wher¦fore yf thou be not moued to py∣tie and complaynte, by so many troubles & myseryes / se that thy owne condycyon, state, degree, thy owne good worke or prayer, corrupte or deceyue the not / yea to be playne thou hast no poynt of a christyan in the. Howe good soeuer thou thynkest thy selfe. But it was prophesyed lōge be∣fore that all these thynges shuld happen, & that god beynge most angre / and the chrysten people sufferynge many troubles / there shuld be no intercessours or pray¦ers for theym to god / as Esaye sayeth weapyng, the .64. there is none that wyl call vpon thy na∣me,
or that myght ryse and hold the. Also Ezechiell the .2.2. chapy. I haue sought for a man amon∣ges theym, the whiche may set a hedge, and stande agaynst me for the erthe / Behold here the wrathe of god and lerne to fere it. that I shulde not destroye it / but I founde none / and I haue powred my indyg∣nacyon vpon them. And I haue wasted theym in the fyre of my wrathe / by the whiche wordes god sheweth, howe that he wold we shulde resyste hym / and pre∣uent his yre / as it is oft redde of the prophete Moyses / whiche ofte tymes by prayer helde god / that he powred not his wrathe vpon the people of Israell. BVt where shall they abyde / whiche not alonlye care not and bewayle not suche calamyte of chrysten people. But also they
laughe standyng in theyr owne conceyte / iudgynge euyll spea∣kynge, backebytynge, syngynge and speakynge of theyr neygh∣bours fautes / and yet they be so without feare & shame / that they doubte not to come into ye chur∣che to heare masse and pray, and to reken them selfes good chry∣sten men. These men haue nede of twyse asmoch prayer as they / whome they iudge, mocke & con¦dempne. It was shewed that su∣che men shuld come, by the thefe that hanged on the lyfte hande of Chryst which checked Chryst in his passyon & trouble. These men also be lyke vnto them that blasphemed Chryste vpon the crosse, what tyme they oughte chefelye to haue helped hym. O god how blynde, ye how madde be we all chrysten men made. O
heuenly father whan shall there be an ende of this yre? ye we may ones make no more blaspheme / & iudge the sorowes of chrysten men / for ye which we shuld come into ye churche to masse / & gather togyther, to pray god to take thē awaye. This maketh our folys∣she insensybilytie & grosenesse. For the Turke pyllynge cyties / coūtreys, & men, we thynke that chrystendome hath a great losse / here we morne, here we call for helpe bothe kyng{is} and princes / but that fayth is loste / ye charytie waxeth colde / yt the word of god is lefte of / ye all maner of synnes preuayle / here is no man at all yt ones thynketh of fyghtynge a∣gaynst them / but rather ye Pope, bysshoppes, preestes, & monkes, be moche worse than the Tur∣kes / and they be the capytaynes
and standerberers of such Tur∣kes & deuelysshe hoostes / whom it wolde be seme to be ye guydes / banerbearers, and rulers of this spirytuall warres / agaynst these spirytuall enemyes. And as Iu∣das was the guyde to them that toke Chryst. (For it was necessa∣ry that he shulde be an apostell / bysshoppe, preest, or one of the chyefe that shulde go aboute to oppresse Chryste). Euen so chry∣stendome, muste be subuerted of them / whiche ought to defende it. And yet they beynge in theyr owne opynyon so stronge / man∣ly and wyse / that they wold eate vp the Turke / leaue the folde & house of god kyndelyd and set a fyre of theyr owne selfes, with ye shepe and all that is in it / not re∣gardynge to persecute the wolfe that lyeth hydde in the grasse.
This therfore is the tyme and rewarde, more mete and worthy for our vnkyndenes / thā the fa∣uoure of god, whiche Chryste gotte for vs frelye by his precy∣ous bloode / greuous laboure & most bytter deathe. LO where be now the∣se ydell men, whiche knowe not how they oughte to do good workes? where be they ye ronne to Rome and to saynt Iames? sette before thyne eyes this one good worke, the masse / lokynge vpon the trouble and myserye of thy neyghboure / haue pytie of his state / complayne that vnto god, and praye to god for hym / doynge the same for the trouble of all chrystendome / and especy∣ally for al prynces, prelates, and
rulers / whome god suffereth to fall & to be synfully corrupte for our intollerable payne & punys∣shement. And yf thou do this de∣lygently from the herte / be thou sure, yt thou arte one of the beste warryours & capytaynes / not onely agaynst ye Turkes / but al∣so ye deuyls and powers of hell. And I pray the, yf thou dost not this / what profyte is it to the, to do all ye myracles of all sayntes? to kyll all Turk{is} / & yet be foūde coulpable & gyltie, as not regar¦dynge the sorowe of thy neygh∣boure / & by ye meanes, synnynge agaynst the ryght. For Chryst at the last iudgemēt, wyll not aske ye howe moche thou haste fasted, prayed, gone pylgrymages, or done this or that, for thy selfe. But howe moch good thou hast done to other / yea yt were poore.
And without doubt there be mo poore mē oppressyd with synne / spirytuall pouertie,Spirytuall pouertie. pryson and nede, than with bodely trouble. And therfore take hede to thy selfe / for oure chosen work{is}, and peculyar purposes, do bryng vs aboue our selfes / so that we one∣ly seke for our owne profyte and welthe. But the cōmaundemen∣tes of god / compelle vs to oure neyghbours / & to serue for theyr welthe onely / by the example of Christ vpon the crosse, prayenge not onely for hym selfe / but for vs / sayenge, father forgyue thē / for they wot not what they do. So must we one praye for ano∣ther. Of this euery man maye knowe, howe froward and wyc∣ked this people is / which backe∣byte, iudge rasshelye / & do none other but dyspyse thē for whome
they ought to praye / in the whi∣che vyce, no man stycketh so dea¦pelye / as they that wery theym selfes in these peculyer and cho∣sen workes / whiche appere mo∣che shynynge and beautefull be∣fore men, for theyr goodlye and outwarde lyfe, with theyr many∣folde good workes. The saboth day.AFter the spirytu∣all sence / this cō∣maūdement hath a more excellente worke / cōtaynyn∣ge the hole nature of man.Saboth, in Hebrewe sig¦nyfyeth / ho∣lye, rest, and quyetnesse. Here therfore must be knowen / that ye Saboth day after the Hebrewe tonge / sygnifyeth, holy or reste / bycause that god rested and cea∣sed the seuenth day from all his workes / whiche he create ye syxe dayes before. Genesis the secōde
chapytre. Therfore god cōmaū∣ded, that we shulde sanctifye the saboth daye / and cease from all our workes / whiche we worke ye syxe dayes. This saboth daye is nowe chaūged into the sonday / and thother dayes be called pro∣phane or workedayes. But the sonday is called, the day of quy∣etnesse or rest, or the holy daye. And I wolde to god, that there were no holy day ī chrystendome but the sonday / so that the feast{is} of our lady and al other sayntes were chaunged into the sonday / for so shulde moche vyce be ex∣chued & lefte throughe ye worke∣dayes / and the countreys shulde not be so oppressed with penury. But nowe we be so laden with ye multytude of holydayes / that it is dystruccyon / bothe of soules, body, and goodes / of the whiche
many thyng{is} myght be spoken. Furthermore this rest from wor¦kes is two maner of wayes / There ben two maner of sabotes. bo∣dely and spirytually / so this com¦maūdement is here vnderstāde / two maner of wayes / for the bo∣dely saboth day or rest / The bodely saboth. is, of the whiche / we haue spoken before / as the ceasynge fro our crafte or labour / in tyme conuenyent to se masse / to here the worde of god / and to praye all togyther for the cōmon welthe of all men / ye whi∣che bodely saboth day is not cō∣maunded to chrysten men / in so moche that the apostell to ye Col∣lossyans the .ii. chapytre, sayeth. Lette no man therfore trouble your conscyence about meate or drynke / or for an pease of an holy day, as the holy daye of the newe moone / or of the sabothe daye / whiche are nothynge but
shadowes of thynges to come / but the body is Chryste. Nowe verely the truthe is fulfylled / so that euery daye is holy daye / as Esaye sayeth the. 6.6. chapytre. And the moneth shall be of the moneth / and the saboth daye / of the saboth daye. And agayne all dayes be prophane and worke∣dayes. But yet this saboth daye is necessarye and ordayned of chrysten people / for the propha∣ne and lay men / for craftes men / labourers and hyred seruaūtes / that they may come togyther / to here the worde of god / for as we se / the preestes and monkes day∣ly sacryfyce and saye masse / pray euery houre / and exercyse them selfe in the worde of god / by stu∣dyeng, readyng, or hearyng. For the which cause they be without labour in comparyson to other /
theyr rentes & pensyons increa∣sed and prouyded for / hauynge dayly holydayes, dayly doynge the work{is} of ye holydayes / with∣out all worke dayes / & to whome all dayes be indyfferent. So yf we were all perfyte, & knewe the gospell / we myght dayly ayther worke & labour / or yf we wolde rest and kepe holy day yf we my∣ghte / for the saboth daye is not nowe necessary nor cōmaunded / but to lerne the worde of god, & to praye. The spiry∣tuall saboth which ought to be halow∣ed euery dayTHe spirytuall holy day, whi¦che god hathe specyally cō∣maunded in this cōmaūdement is / that not onely we labour not, and leaue our occupacyon / but moche more that we suffre god onely to worke in vs / workynge nothyng of our owne, in all our
power / but howe shulde that be? Thus it is, man corrupte with synne / hathe moche euyll loue & desyre to al synnes / as the scryp∣ture sayth. Genesis the .viii. cha. All the thoughte of mānes herte is gyuen to euyll at all tymes / that is, to pryde, dysobedyence,The spiry∣tuall saboth is to reste & ceasse frō all ye workes of our olde A∣dam, to mor¦tefye thape∣tytes of our corrupte na∣ture, and to put on Iesu Chryst, and all his wor∣kes. yre, hate, couetyse, vnclennes. And to be short in all thynges yt he dothe or leaueth vndone. He seaketh more his owne profyte and pleasure / than the glorye of god or his neyghbour / so that al his workes, all his thoughtes, & all his lyfe / is yll and not godly. Therfore to the ende yt god may worke in hym / all these vyces & malyces muste be dystroyed and plucked vp / yt here may sprynge the rest and ceasyng of our wor∣kes, thoughtes, wordes, & lyfe, that hereafter, not we / but as
saynt Paule sayeth to the Gala∣tianes the fyrst chapytre. Chryst may worke, lyue and speake in vs. But this is not done with pleasaūt dayes / but we must do vyolence to nature, and suffre / ye vyolence be done vnto it / for here begynneth the batayle be∣twene the spiryte & the flesshe / here the spiryte wrasteleth aga∣ynste yre / voluptuousnes, & pry∣de / the flesshe wyllynge to flowe full of pleasure, honoure, ydel∣nes, & reste / of the whiche spea∣keth saynt Paule to the Galati∣anes / the .v. chapy. They that be of Chryst, hathe crucyfyed theyr flesshe, wt appetytes and lustes. Out of this saboth therfore fo∣lowe good workes / to faste, to watche, to pray, to labour / of the which, many men speake & wry∣te so moch, & yet they knowe no∣ther
the begynnnge nor ende of them.The spiry∣tuall saboth is kepte two maner of wayes. And therfore at this tyme we shall speake of theym. This holy day whiche god worketh in vs, whan oure workes cease / is kept two maner of wayes. Fyrst by our owne exercyse / secōdare∣ly by another outwarde exercy∣synge or mocyon. Therfore our exercyse must be so ordered / that fyrst we se wherunto our flesshe is gyuen / and to what our wyll and reason prouoketh vs / & that we resyst them and folowe them not / as the wyse man sayeth, do thou not go after thyne owne lustes and appetytes / and Deu∣teronomye the .xii. chapytre. Do that onely that I cōmaunde the / and thou shalte put nothynge to the lorde, nor take nothynge a∣waye. Here a man muste haue the prayers euer in vse / whiche
Dauyd prayed, saynge. Lorde brynge me in the way of thy cō∣maundement{is} / and not into co∣uetyce. Item shewe me thy way∣es / and teache me thy pathes / yt my steppes be not moued, & such many / the which all this prayer conteyneth. Lorde let thy kyng∣dome come / for there be so many and so manyfold appetytes and lustes / and somtyme so subtyll and goodly by the suggestion of the euyl spiryte / that it is vnpos∣syble for a man to rule hym selfe in his lyfe. Let hym therfore for∣sake handes and fete, & put hym selfe / to the rule of god / trustyng nothyng in his owne reason / as Hieremye sayth. Lorde the waye of man is not in his owne pow∣er. And that was fygured, whan ye chyldren of Israel went out of Egypt / where they had no way /
no meate, no drynke, nor helpe. Therfore god went byfore them by daye tyme in a clere clowde / but at nyght in a fyerye pyllar / nourysshyng them wt aungelles foode / from heuen / so kepynge theyr shoes and clothes / that they were not torne / as it is red in the bokes of Moyses. And therfore let vs praye / lorde lette thy kyngdome come / that thou mayst rule vs, and not we our selfes / For there is nothyng mo∣re perillous ī vs / than our owne propre wyll & reason. And this is the cheyf and hyghest worke / of god, and the beste exercyse to leaue our owne workes / and to be voyde fre and ydle from all our owne wyll and reason / com∣myttynge our selfe to god in all thynges / specyally / where as spi¦rytuall & good thynges appere.
AFter this spirytu∣all exercyse folow¦eth the exercyse of the flesshe / to kyll his euyll & grosse desyres / to make rest and quyet∣nesse, whiche we muste kyll with fastyng,Here lerne of fasting, wat¦chyng, with other labou∣res and exer¦cyse of ye bo∣dy, wherfore they serue, & for what in∣tēt they shul∣de be done. watchyng, and labour. Out of the whiche grounde we lerne howe moch / and wherfore we ought to fast, watche, and la∣bour. For there be many blynde men (alas for sorowe) that faste, watche, & laboure, onely for this cause / that they thynke they be good workes in them selfe / and that they deserue many thynges in them / and so contynuynge in suche thynges so longe / that o∣therwhyles they dystroye theyr owne bodyes, and make theym selfes desye in the heades. But yet they be more blynde / whiche
measure not onely theyr fast af∣ter theyr multytude or great∣nes / but also after ye meates thin kynge that it is moche better yf they eate not flesshe, egges, or butter. And yet of all other they be worse / that faste for sayntes & chose dayes / as whā one fasteth wednysday, and another satur∣daye / & he fasteth for saynt Bar∣bara, and another for saynt Se∣bastyan, & suche other. All these seke none other thīge in fasting, but the worke in it selfe / by the which they thynke they do well. I here wyttyngly passe ouer ma¦ny, which so fast fro meate / that yet they drynke tyl they be dron∣ken / some eate fysshe, & other de∣intyes so costly whan they faste / yt they might eate flesshe, egges, and butter farre better cheape / but suche maner of fastynge / is
no fastynge / but rather a mocke both to fastyng and to god / ther¦fore I wolde ye euery man shuld chose what daye, what meate, & howe moche he wolde fast / after his owne mynde / so yt he there rest not / but let hym marke the state of his flesshe / & so fast wat∣che and labour / that he tame the fearsnes and wantones of it / & neuer the more that the pope / bysshop / churche / goostly father, or any other man cōmaunded it / For the maner and rule of fastīg watchynge and labour / is to be taken of no man / nother after ye multytude of meates or dayes / but after the increasynge or dys∣creasynge of the concupyssence and outragyousnes of ye flesshe / and for to kyll & oppresse them / fastynges / watches / and labour was ordayned / & for none other
cause / for yf there were no suche desyres, it were as good to eate / as to faste, to slepe, as to watch, to be ydell, as to laboure / & one as good as another, without all dyfference. IF therfore a man perceyue & fynde / that ther groweth more fearsnesse in his flesshe, by ea∣tynge of fysshe / than by egges & flesshe. He than oughte to eate flesshe & no fysshe. And agayne yf he feale his heade to be cor∣rupte, and his body and his sto∣make to be weake with fastyng / or that he hathe no neade to op∣presse the fearsnesse of his flesshe let hym leaue fastynge, eatynge, slepynge, restynge, as moche as he hathe nede for ye helthe of his
body / not lokynge whether it be agaynste the cōmaundementes of the churche / her ordre or de∣cre / for there is no cōmaunde∣ment of the churche, nor consty∣tucyons of any ordre / that maye ordayne & prescrybe fastynges, watchynges, and laboure, more straytelye, than they profyte to tame and mortyfye the volup∣tuous desyres of the flesshe. But where soeuer (without this pur∣pose and ende) they cōmaunde fastyng, meates, slepe, and wat∣ches, more hardely than the fles∣she may suffre / or more than is neade to the kyllynge of the lust of the flesshe / so that nature is corrupt and the heade lost / than let no man thynke that he hathe done a good worke / excusynge hym selfe, other by the cōmaun∣dementes of the churche / or els
by the constytucyons of his or∣dre / for he shall seme to haue wanted to hym selfe / and as mo∣che as laye in hym to be a man∣sleyer and stryker of hym selfe. No truely, the bodye is not gy∣uen to kyll his naturall lyfe or worke / but onely to oppresse his fyersnesse / excepte the fyersnesse be so great / that it can not be re∣systed without the hurte & losse of naturall lyfe. And as I sayde before, in the exercysynge of fas∣tynge, watchynge and labour / a man must haue an eye not to the worke in it selfe, not to ye dayes, multytude, or meates / but o∣nely to the fyers & wanton Adam / so that the wan∣tonesse and fyerse∣nesse may be ta∣ken from hym.
OF these we may per∣ceyue howe wyselye or folysshelye some woman great with chylde do / and howe sycke men shulde be intreated. For folysshe women stycke so to fastynges, yt they wyll rather put bothe theyr byrthe, & theym selfes in ieoper∣dye / than they shulde not fast e∣qually togyther with other mē / hauyng conscyence there where is none / and agayne, there as is conscyence hauynge none. The cause of the which thyng be pre∣chers / prechynge, fastynges, so rasshelye & folysshelye / that they shewe neuer the truthe / vse, ma∣ner, profyte, cause, or ende of it. So we shulde suffre the sycke to eate and drynke daylye what so∣euer they wyll. And to be shorte, whan the fearsnesse of the flesshe
ceaseth by and by / ceaseth all the cause of fastynge, watchynge, la¦bourynge, eatyng this meate or that, nother is there / any other cōmaūdement that cōpellyth or byndeth vs to faste. And of the other syde, we must take hede le∣aste by this lybertie / there grow a vnlusty slouthfulnesse of ye fles∣she. Truth it is yt our olde Adam is passyng subtyll in sekynge his owne ease and pleasure, preten∣dynge euer this dysease, or that dysease to auoyde fastynge, as ye ache of the heade, weakenesse of body with such lyke. As there be some / bablynge that it is not ne¦cessarye / that we shuld faste and absteyne, wyllynge yt we shulde eate this or yt without any feare at all tymes / as thoughe they had ben longe / and moche exer∣cysed in fastynge / and yet truely
they neuer tasted it. And no lesse we ought to auoyde sclaunders before them / whiche be not in∣structe and wyse ynoughe / but take it for a great synne, yf we do not bothe fast and eate togy∣ther with theym after theyr ma¦ner and custome. And in dede su∣che men shulde be instructe and taught swetely and not dispysed cruellye / nor we shulde eate this or that for the dysdayne or hate of them / but we muste shewe a reason / why this may be well & laufull ye done / & so they also by a lytell, & lytell, may be broughte vnto the same vnderstandyng. But yf they be so stubbornely frowarde yt they wyll here no man. Than let them alone. & let vs do that that we knowe to be good and ryght.
THe latter exercyse whiche happeneth vnto vs, is whā we be hurte, other by mē or by ye deuyll, whā we be spoyled other of goodes, or ryches, whan the body is sycke / whan honour is taken from vs / and what seeuer moueth vs to impacyency, wra∣the, and vnquyetnesse. For as ye worke of god ruleth in vs after his wysdome, and not after our owne reason, after his clennes / and not after the fyersnes of our flesshe. For charyte & wysdome be the workes of god / but folys∣shenesse and vnclennesse be oure workes, from ye whiche we muste absteyne / so he oughte to rule in vs after his peace, and not after our yre, impacyence and warre For peace also is the worke of god / but impacyency is yt worke of our flesshe, which must be left
& mortyfyed. Wherfore to mor∣tyfye suche our workes and the olde Adam / god layeth vpon our neckes many aduersyties / mo∣uynge vs to wrathe / many pas∣syons prouokynge vs to impa∣cyence / and at last dethe & sclaū∣der of the worlde / sekynge no o∣ther thynge by this meanes, but that yre, impacyence and warre dryuen out of vs, he might come to his worke, that is to saye / to peace in vs. So sayeth Esaye ye xxviii. chapytre. His worke is straūge, that he may worke his worke, that is to say / he sendeth vs passyons, warre, and debate that he may lerne vs to haue pa¦cyence & peace. He cōmaundeth to dye that he may quycken / vn¦tyll a man be so exercysed, so pa∣cyfyed and so quyete / that he be nothynge moued in prosperytie
nor in aduersytie, whether he ly∣ue or dye / whether he be honou∣red or sclaunderyd / than there worketh god onely / thanne is there no mans worke / than this shall be called the trewe sabothe day / thā a mā is not led of hym selfe / than he foloweth not his owne wyll, than is he troubled in no thynge / but god his selfe guydeth hym. Than there is playnly the wyll of god, peace & myrthe with all other good wor¦kes and vertues. GOd settyth so mo∣che by these wor∣kes / that he com∣maunded not one¦ly the saboth to be obserued and called saboth day / but that it shulde be sanctifyed or iudged holy / so shewyng that
there is nothing better, nothyng more precyous / than to suffre al troublous. For they be the rely∣ques, the holy thynges that con∣secrate or holowe a man frō his owne workes / to the workes of god / as the temple is consecrate from all naturall workes to the worshyppe of god. And therfore let a man knowlege thē as wor¦shypfull relyques / ioynynge and gyuyng thankes to god yf they come. For whā they come / they so sanctifye a man, that he doth the cōmaundent of god / and is made safe & deyuerde frō all his synnes, so sayth Dauyd / ye dethe of his sayntes is precious in the syght of the lorde. And to ye ende that god myghte bolden & quic∣kenvs to these thynges / he hath not onely cōmaunded vs the ke∣pynge of the saboth day (for it is
greatly agaynst nature to dye & to suffre to rest & be deade from her owne workes). But also he cōforteth vs by manyfolde wor¦des in scrypture / sayenge to vs the .89. psalme. I shall be present with hym in trybulacion, I shal defende hym & indue hym with dygnytie. Also ye .xxxiii. psalme full nyghe is the lorde to men broken ī the hert / he saueth the contryte in spiryte / nor he was content with this / but he hathe gyuen vs a myghty and stronge example / his onely sone Iesus our lorde / whiche all the hole sa∣bothe daye lay voyde, & without al his workes / as {per}taynyng to ye manhode / & fyrste of all men ful∣fylled his cōmaūdment / for no nede of hym selfe, but onely for our comforte / that we in all our sufferynges / yea euyn in dethe /
myght be quyete and at reste / & hauynge peace, lokynge vpon Chryste / reased vp agayne after his reste and sabothe daye / daye thensforth lyuyng in onely god, and god in hym. And so we after the mortyfyenge of oure Adam / whiche shall not be fully vntyll the honour of dethe, shall be ray¦sed vp in god / yt god may worke and lyue in vs for euermore. Lo these be the thre partes of man / reason, pleasure, and heuynesse / in the whiche all his workes go forth / which must be mortyfyed by these thre exercysyng{is} / ye rule or gouernyng of god / our chasty synges and outwarde hurtes / that so we kepynge a sabothe day spirytu∣all, may gyue pla / ce to the wor∣kes of god.
BVt suche workes & sufferyng{is} must be done in faythe and good truste of god¦des loue / A recapula∣cyon of all yt is gone befo¦re, whiche cō¦cerneth the fyrste table of cōmaun∣dementes. yt all wor¦kes may abyde in ye fyrst cōmaū¦dement and fayth, as is sayd be∣fore / and ye faythe maye exercyse & strength her selfe in them / for the which thyng be all the other workes & cōmaundementes or∣deyned. Marke therfore howe goodlye a golde rynge is made / of these thre cōmaundementes / and theyr workes / and how out of the fyrst cōmaundement and faythe, ronneth the seconde in to the thyrde / and agayne ye thyrde by the seconde / entreth in to the fyrst / for the fyrst worke is to be∣leue, and haue a good herte and truste in god / out of this spryn∣geth the seconde good worke /
whiche is to prayse the name of god, to confesse his grace, and to ascrybe & gyue all glorye to hym onely. Than after foloweth the thyrde worke / yt is the worshype or seruyce of god / to exercyse thy selfe in prayer / in hearyng of ser¦mondes, in remembryng the be∣nefytes of god. Also to chastyse hym selfe & to tame his flesshe. The deuyll therfore seynge such faythe, glorye, and worshype of goo / waxeth madde, begynnyng {per}secucyon comynge vpō our bo∣dy, good{is}, honour, & lyfe / & put∣teth vnto vs syckenes, sclaūder, & deth / god so sufferyng & ordey∣nyng hym. Lo than beginneth ye ii. worke, or .ii. saboth day of the iii. cōmaūdement / wherby fayth is meruaylouslye proued, euyn as golde in a fornayse. For it is a great thyng to kepe good trust
to god / yea whā he sendeth deth, sclaūder, syckenes, & pouertie: & yet neuerthelesse in such a feare∣full Image of deth to coūt hym for a most meke & gentyl father / the which thynge must be in the worke of this thyrde cōmaunde∣ment / where sufferyng cōpelieth faythe, to call vpon the name of god, & to prayse hym in such suf∣ferynges / & so agayne turneth the thyrde cōmaūdement in to ye secōde. And by the praysyng and callyng vpon ye name of god, ry∣seth fayth / cōmyng agayne in to her selfe / & stablysshyng her felfe by two workes of the seconde & thyrde cōmaūdement / so faythe goeth out in to workes, and by workes commeth agayne to her selfe. Lyke as the sonne rysynge ī the East, goeth to the Weest / after that retouryng agayne to
the Easte.Daye. For the whiche cause the day in holy scrypture is pro∣perly lykened vnto the work{is} of a quyte & peasable lyfe.Nyght. But the nyght is lykened to ye sufferynge lyfe, oppressed with trouble and aduersytie. And so faythe lyueth & worketh in bothe these lyues / goeth out & cōmeth in, as Chryst sayeth in the .vi. chapi. of Iohn̄. Se here how the ordre of the .x. cōmaū¦demētes ben obserued in our Pater noster.WE praye for this or∣dre of good workes in our Pater noster, in ye whiche, the fyrst thyng that we say, is our father whiche arte in heuen, whiche be the wordes of the fyrst worke of faythe / whiche by the tenoure of the fyrste cōmaundement doub∣teth not / but yt she hathe a good & mercyfull father in heuen. Se¦condely, halowed be thy name /
by the which, faythe desyreth the name, prayse, and glorye of god to be shewed / callynge vpon the name of god in all aduersytie. Thyrdly, let thy kyngdome co∣me, wherby we do praye / for the trewe and laufull saboth day / & rest from our workes, that the worke of god be onelye in vs / and that Chryste may so reygne in vs / as in his kyngdome, as he hym selfe sayd. Verely I saye vnto you / the kyngdome of god is no where but withī you. The fourthe peticyon is. Thy wyll be fulfylled, in the which we praye, that we may kepe and do the se∣uen cōmaundementes of the se∣conde table / in the which and by the whiche, faythe is exercysed to our neyghbours / as in these thre fyrst / she is exercysed in wor¦kes towarde god. And these thre
prayers, in the whiche ben these pronounce / thou thyne / seke no∣thynge els but that, that belon∣geth to god, but al other prayers say, ours, to vs & for vs. &c. For we pray there for our gooddes & for our helth. Hytherto haue we spoken of the fyrste table of Moy¦ses / & truely the more grosely to shewe the chyef good workes vn¦to the symple. Nowe therfore fo¦lowe the seconde table. ¶ The fyrste cōmaundement of the seconde table / honour thy Fyther and thy mother. WE lerne of this com∣maundement, ye next the hyghe workes of the .iij. fyrst cōmaun∣demēes / there is no better wor¦ke than obedyence & seruyce vn∣to them which be ordeyned to be
oure superyours. And therfore disobedyence is a greatter synne thā manslaughter, vnclennesse, thefte, & disceyte / & what soeuer may comprehende in it. For we can knowe no better ye difference of synnes,Howe to knowe the greatnes of one synne aboue ano∣ther. which is greatter one thā the other / than by ye ordre of godd{is} cōmaūdement{is}. Howbete one & euery cōmūdemēt by hym selfe hath disterēce ī his worke / for who is he yt knoweth not / yt to curse & bāne, is more greuous than to be angrye / & to stryke is worse thā to curse / & to stryke fa¦ther or mother / is worse, than to stryke any other of ye cōmon peo¦ple? Therfore these .x. cōmaūde∣mētes teach vs howe we ought to exercyse good workes to uore neyghbour / & fyrst to our supery oures.The honour of father & mother. The fyrst worke is to ho∣nour our bodely father & moder
The whiche honoure standeth not in this onely, that we shew our selfes godly in our gesture / but that we applye & obey them & haue theyr wordes reuerently in our iyes, settynge moche by them, and regardynge them, fo∣lowynge thē, holdyng our peace & sufferynge them, howe soeuer they intreate vs, whan it is not agaynst the thre fyrste cōmaun¦demētes. And moreouer yf they haue nede we must prouyde thē, meate, clothyng, and house. For it is not for nought yt god sayd, honoure them / he sayd not loue thē / howe be it that loue is also requyred / but honour is hygher thā syngle loue,Honour is a¦boue loue. for it hath a cer∣tayne feare growynge togyther with loue, causyng a mā to feare more the displeasure. thā the pu∣nysshement. Euen as we wor∣shyppe
relyques with feare / and yet we fle not fro them as from punysshement / but rather appro¦che more nyghe them / suche fea∣re myngled with loue is true ho∣noure.What ho∣noure is. For there is another fea∣re without loue, to those thyng{is} whiche we dispyce or fle from. As from manquellers or punys∣shemēt, and there is no honour. For it is feare without all loue / yea it is a feare ioyned with ha∣tred and enuye / of the whiche is a prouerbe of saynt Hierome, sayenge / that, that we feare we hate? with such feare wyll god nother be feared nor honou∣red / nor yet our father nor mother / but with ye fyrst feare, to whome is loue and trust ioyned.
THis worke semeth lyght and easy, but fewe esteme it wor∣thely. For where as the father and mo∣ther be good, louyng theyr chyl∣dren, not with carnall loue / but as they be bounde to holynesse & the worshyppyng of god, bryng∣ynge them vp / & teachyng them in the thre fyrst cōmaundemen∣tes: there is alwaye the chyldes owne wyll broken. So that he is compelled to forsake & to suf∣fre that, that his nature wolde not / wherby he fyndeth a cause to despyce his father and his mo¦ther / & to grudge agaynst them / or to go about & do worse thyn∣ges. There than goeth awaye bothe loue and feare, excepte the grace of god helpe. Lykewyse whā the father and mother cor∣recte
and chaste theyr chyldren as they deserue / yea other why∣les more than they deserue (the whiche thyng yet is no let to the soules helthe) than the frowarde nature taketh suche chastesynge with dysdayne. Moreouer there be some of such vngracyous dis∣posicyon / that they be a shamed of ye pouertie, loue, byrthe, defor∣mytie, or sclaūder of theyr father & mother, sufferyng them selfe to be moued more with such thyn∣ges / than with this hyghe com∣maūdemēt of god / ye is aboue all thynge / which by his great coū∣sel, hath gyuen thē such father & mother to proue & exercyse thē in his cōmaūdemēt. But this is mo¦che strōger whā ye chyldren be at lyberte / for thā loue goyng dow∣ne, there is moche loue taken a∣way frō ye father & mother: what¦soeuer
is cōmaūded and sayd of oure father & mother / that must be vnderstāde also of them yt be in ye stede of our father & mother whan they be deade or absent / as be our kynsfolke, our godfar¦thers / temporall rulers, and spi∣rytuall fathers. For euery man must be ruled of other men, and be vnder them. Wherfore we se here also, howe many good wor¦kes is taught in this cōmaunde¦ment / in as moch as all our lyfe is subiect vnto other men. Hense it cōmeth, that obedyence is so greatly praysed, and that it com¦prehēdeth all vertues and good workes in it. Agaynste euyll bryn∣gyng vp of chyldren.THere is another sclaunder agaynst the father and mo∣ther, moch more subtyll & peryl∣lous than ye fyrst / whiche is gar∣nysshed
and set forth for ryght & true honoure. And that is whan the chylde lyueth after his owne mynde and wyll / his father and mother sufferynge hym to do it. Here is honour, here is loue, but it is but beastlye of bothe {per}tyes. Here the father and the mother please the chylde, and the chylde agayne pleaseth the father & the mother. This punysshement is so open and cōmon, that there be verye seldome examples sene of the fyrst sclaunder / which thyng happeneth bycause that the fa∣ther and mother be blynded, and nother know nor worshype god in the fyrste cōmaundementes. And for this cause, they can not se what thynge theyr chyldren lacke / and howe they shulde be taught and brought vp. And so they brynge thē vp to prophane
& worldly honoures & ryches / yt they may onely please men / & by all meanes to be exalted & made great men. This thyng is plea∣saūt to ye chyldren / into this they be obedyent without any gayne sayenge. So the cōmaūdemētes of god, vnder ye colour of good∣nes go to wreake / & yt is fulfyl∣led: which is wryten by ye prophe¦tes, Esaye, & Hieremye / that the tyme shulde come, whan ye chyl∣dren shuld be dystroyed by theyr owne fathers & mothers. After the example of kynge Manasses which suffered his sone to offre, do sacryfyce, and burne beastes to ye ydoll Moloch. For I praye you, what other thynge is this / than the chylde to do sacryfyce & offre to an ydolle / whan the fa∣ther & mother brynge theym vp more to ye loue of the worlde, thā
of god / sufferyng thē to be cary∣ed after theyr owne wyll, in the pleasures of ye worlde / to be set a fyre wt the loue, myrth, goodes & honoure of this worlde / & the loue & glorye of god, & the plea∣sure of euerlastyng goodes to be quenched & clene put out in thē? O howe great ieo{per}dye is it to be a father & mother, where as no∣thynge reygneth but flesshe and blode? For it stādeth hooly ī this cōmaūdement / yt the thre fyrste & syxe last be knowen & kepte. In as moche, as it is cōmaūded to ye father & mother to teache theyr chyldren those thyng{is} as it is in ye .77. psalme. He gaue his cōmaū¦demēt vnto Iacobe / and put his lawe into Israel, whā he cōmaū¦ded the fathers to declare these thyng{is} to theyr chyldren / yt theyr posteryte myghte knowe them /
and yt theyr chyldren whan they be waxen vp, myght shewe ye sa∣me to theyr chyldren also. And this is the cause why god hathe cōmaūded to honour thy father & mother / that is, to loue them with feare / for loue without fea∣re is more sclaūder than it is ho∣nour. Now marke therfore whe∣ther al men haue ynoughe good workes to do, or not. Whether soeuer they be fathers and mo∣thers, or they be chyldren. But we be so blynde, that we let this alone and seke for other workes not cōmaunded. WHere than as the father and mother be so folysshe, that they brynge vp theyr chyl∣dren wantonly and worldly / the chyldren in no wyse shuld obeye them / for god is more to be sette
by in the thre fyrst cōmaūdemen¦tes, than our father and mother. I call wātonly & worldly bryn∣gyng vp / whā they teach vs not more to seke & folowe god / than the pleasures, honours, ryches, & power of this world / to weare laufull & clene rayment / and lo∣ke for honest good{is} / is necessary & no synne. So yet that ye chylde be so taught in his herte that at the leaste in the puttynge on and wearynge of his apparell,The trewe wearyng of apparell. he so∣rowe and lament the wretched∣nesse of this lyfe in erthe, that it can not well be begon, nor pas∣sed ouer, wtout moche more ray∣ment and ryches than neade re∣quyreth / to hyll & couer the bo∣dy / to keape away the colde / and get a lyuynge so / that he shalbe constrayned agaynst his wyll to playe the foole / for the fauoure
of the worlde, & suffre this euyll for a better thynge to exchue the worse.The spirytu¦altie neuer redde this text of Hes∣tor. Thus the quene Hester dyd weare her crowne, sayenge vnto god / thou knowest my ne∣cessytie yt I abhorre the sygne of pryde & my glorye, which is vpō my hede, in the dayes of my bos∣tynge / and I dysdayne it, as the clothe of a menstruate woman / & the whiche I wyll not beare in ye dayes of my sylence, what soe∣uer hert therfore is thus armed / may weare all maner of garmen¦tes wtout all ieo{per}dy / for he wea∣reth them, & weareth thē not / he playeth of ye instrumētes & play∣eth not / he lyueth gloryouslye, & not gloryously. And these be the preuy soules & secrete spouses of Chryste / but they be very scarse. For it is very harde, not to dely∣te in goodly raymēt & bostynge.
So saynt Cecyle by the cōmaū∣dement of her father & mother, dyd weare clothe of golde / but vnder yt she ware heare. But here wyll some say / yea syr, but howe than shall I mary my doughter honourably? Am I not in suche a case cōpelled to boste my selfe? But I praye the tell me / be not these the wordes of a herte mys∣trustynge god, & trustynge more in his owne proper wysdome / than in the cure and prouysyon of god? All thoughe saynt Pe∣ter teacheth vs, and sayeth / caste all youre care on hym for he ca∣reth for you / yea it is a token, that suche men dyd neuer gyue god thankes for theyr chyldren / neyther haue truely prayed or cō¦mended them vnto his goodnes. Or els they shulde knowe and proue how they ought to aske &
desyre of god / that they myght marye theyr daughters. Ther∣fore god suffereth them to theyr owne wytte, care & benefytes / and not to ende theyr busynesse conuenyently. SO true is that, yt is cōmonly sayd / ye father and mo∣ther may get he∣uen ī theyr owne chyldren / yf they had nothynge els to do. For in ye bryngyng vp of them to the wor¦shyppe of god / they haue bothe theyr hādes full (as ye mā sayth) to do good workes. For what be the hungry, thyrstye, naked, pry∣soners, sycke, and straungers / but the soules of thy chyldren,A chrysten mans house is an hospy∣tall. of ye which god hath made thyne house an inne or an hospytall /
makyng ye to them as ye mayster of the hospytall / that thou shul∣dest keape them / feade them / gy∣ue them meate and drynke / with good workes and wordes? that they may lerne to trust in god, to byleue & feare hym, and to put theyr hope in hym, worshypyng his name / not sweryng nor cur∣synge, chastysynge them selfes / prayenge, fastynge, watchynge, laborynge, and to serue god and his worde / & to kepe his sabothe day, that they may lerne to de∣spyse tēporall thynges / to suffre pacyently aduersytie / not to fea∣re dethe, & not to loue this lyfe. Lo how great busynes these be. Lo howe many good workes thou haste at home, in thy chylde that lacketh all suche thynges / as the soule beynge hungrye, thyrsty, naked, poore, prysoned,
& sycke. O howe blessyd a thyn∣ge is matrymony. O howe hap∣pye be those houses in the whi∣che dwell suche fathers and mo∣thers. For they be the verye true temple and electe abbay of god / yea rather a Paradyse / of the whiche is spoken .127. psalme. Blessyd be he, who soeuer ho∣noureth the lorde, and walketh in his wayes. Thou shalte eate the labours of thy owne hādes / and shalte haue prosperous in∣crease. Thy wyfe shalbe fruteful as the vyne tree / wtin the walles of thy house / thyne chyldren shal stande about the table, lyke the plantes of Olyue trees. Lo thus shall that man be blessyd, which worshyppe the lorde / the lorde shall blesse the from Syon / and thou shalte delyte, beholdynge the prosperyte of Ierusalem all
dayes of thy lyfe / and thou shalt se thy chylders chyldren / and ye felycytie of Ierusalē. Where be suche fathers & mothers / where be they that aske for good wor∣kes? no man commeth hyther. Therfore (I say) god hath com¦maunded that thynge / from the whiche the deuyll / our flesshe & bloode pulleth vs. It is not goodly in the syght of ye worlde / and therfore it is not set by. But one ronneth to saynt Iames / & another voweth hym self to our lady. And no man voweth hym selfe to the glory of god / and to rule and teache well hym selfe and his chyldren / he forsaketh theym, whome he hathe taken to kepe by the commaundement af god / and laboureth to ser∣ue god other wayes / where he hathe no commaundemente /
there is no bysshoppe yt resysteth suche frowarde maners / no pre∣cher rebuketh these thynges / ye rather they stablysshe such thyn∣ges / inuentynge dayly mo pyl∣grymages, canonysynge of mo sayntes, & sellynge of {per}dons. I praye god therfore to haue mer∣cye on suche blyndnesse. ANd agayne vpon the other syde, the father and the mo¦ther do not soner deserue hell / than in theyr owne chyldren at home, whā they lacke to them not tea∣chynge thē these thynges which be spoken of before. For what doth it profyte them, yf they dye with fastyng, prayenge, goynge pylgrymage, & doynge all other good workes. In as moche god
wyll not aske vs of suche thyn∣ges / nother at the tyme of dethe, nor at the laste iudgemente? but wyll aske a compte of oure chyl∣dren cōmytte to oure custodye? This proueth the sayeng of chry¦ste, the .2.3. chapytre of Luke. Ye women of Ierusalem wepe not for me, but for your selues, & for your chyldren for lo ye tyme shall come, whan they shall saye.Take he∣de al you that haue househol∣des and chyldren. Hap∣pye be ye baren, and the wombes, whiche haue not borne chyldren, and the brestes whiche haue not gyuen sucke. Why shulde they so complayne / but that all theyr dampnacyon cōmeth to them for theyr sones / whiche yf they had lacked, peraduenture they shulde haue ben blessyd. Trewely these wordes shulde open the iyes of ye Fathers and mothers to loke spi¦ritually vpon theyr chyldren leste
the wretched chyldren, shulde be deceyued by the false carnall loue of theyr father and mother, whā they be not angrye with theym bycause they obey them after the cōmon nature of the people / by the whiche thynges, theyr free wyll is stablysshed and waxeth stronge / and yet the cōmaunde∣mente of God therfore cōmaun∣deth vs to honoure our Father & our mother, that yt chyldren may be made lowe, demure, & meke / theyr free wyll broken & dystroy∣ed. Therfore as it is sayde in the other cōmaundementes, that the workes must be so obserued, that they procede out of the fyrst wor∣ke, euyn so here / let no man thyn¦ke that the orderynge and bryn∣gynge vp of his chyldren is suffy∣cyent of it selfe / but yf it be done in the grace & fauoure of god / so
that a mā doubteth nothynge of it / but that he pleaseth god in all suche workes. Therfore let these workes be nothynge els to a mā but sygnes and exercysynges of fayth to truste in God / & to haue a surenesse in his grace, and lybe∣rall wyll. For without this fayth noo worke other lyueth / or is good and pleasaunte to god. For many of the Hethens, and gentylles haue brought vp theyr chyldren well / but that dyd pro∣fyte theym nothonge, bycause of theyr vabeleue. THe seconde worke of this cōmaundemēt is to honour our spi¦rituall mother holy churche, and the ec∣clesyastycall power, cōmaundyn∣ge, forbydgynge, ordeynynge, ma¦kynge,
cursynge, or absoluynge. In all these we muste obey them and as we honoure, loue, and fea¦re our bodely fathers & mothers, euen so we must obey the spyrytu¦all power in all thynges, whiche be not contrary to the thre fyrste cōmaundementes of god. But in this worke, the matter is farre ī worse case, thā in the fyrst. For it wolde become the ecclesyastycall power to punysshe synnes by ex∣cōmunycacyon / cursynge, & law¦es / and to compell theyr spirytu∣al persons to goodnes / that they myghte haue a cause to do good workes, and to exercyse them sel∣fes to obedyence / and gyuyng ho¦noure to the power. But we se that the spirytuall power taketh no hede at all to kepe theyr chyl∣dren in theyr offyce / but so to dea¦le with theyr people & subiectes,
as mothers folowynge theyr lo∣uers. As it is sayd in the .ij. chap. of Ozee. They preache not, they teche not, they resyste not, they re¦buke not, they punysshe not / and to be shorte there is no ecclesyas∣tycall gouernynge left in all chry¦stendome. What than shulde I speake in this worke? There be lefte yet some fastyngdayes, and holy dayed / which it were better to anulle / but no man careth for that. So there is no thynge that flouryssheth nowe / but excōmu∣nycacyon, for duetyes accusto∣med / the whiche thynge oughte not to be. But the power of the churche shulde se that adulterye, vnclennesse, glotonye, pryde, vn∣mesurable ryote of all thynge, and suche other vyces be punys∣shed and let. And also that ye col∣leges, and abbeyes, parysshes, &
scoles be well ordred / and ye god∣des seruyce be holely kept in thē. And that the yonge bothe men & maydes in the scoles and abbeys haue good and cōnynge men pro¦uyded to teache them, that they may be wel brought vp / that the olde may {pro}fyte ye yonge by good example / & that the chyldren & cōmon welth may be fylled & gar¦nysshed with goodly youth. For so saynt Paule taught his discy∣ple Titus / yt he shuld teache well and gouerne all degrees & estat{is}, yonge and olde men and womē. But nowe we lyue euery man af∣ter his owne wyll, euery man tea¦cheth hym selfe, yea (alas for soro¦we) it is come to the poynt / that the places in the which goodnes shulde be taughte, be now made scoles of vanyties, so that no mā taketh hede of outragious youth
IF euery thyng were ordered after this maner, than a mā myghte shewe howe honour and obedyence ought to be done to ec¦clesiastyke persones. But it is nowe with theym, as it is with bodely fathers & mothers, whi∣che suffer theyr chyldren to moch after theyr owne mynde & wyll / and ecclesyastycall power, dothe nowe graunte and dyspence / and for money pardoneth more than it may pardone. Here I wyll let many thynges passe yt I myghte speke of / for I se moo thynges than be well. Couetyse sytteth and gouerneth, and the churche teacheth that, that it shulde for∣byd. And besydes these, it is open to euery mans iyes / that the ly∣uynge of the spyrytualtie is mo∣che more vngoodlyer and vyler / than the lyfe of the lay or seculer
men. Wherfore the chrystyan cō¦mon welthe muste nedes be dy∣stroyed / and this cōmaundemēt subuerted. For where there were suche a bysshoppe, as wolde take hede, vysyte, loke vpon, and go a∣boute all suche orders and degre¦es, with so great dylygence and laboure, as he is bounde / truelye one cytie were to moch for hym. For in the tyme of the apostles / whan the churche was most stou¦rysshynge / euery cytie hadde one bysshop, although the last parte of the worlde, was not than chry¦stened. Howe thanne shulde it be well amonges men / whan one bysshop wyll haue thus moche / another so moche, the thyrde cha¦lengeth halfe ye worlde / and the fourthe wolde haue all the worl∣de vnder his rule? Therfore it is nowe tyme to praye to god for
grace. For we haue ecclesyasty∣call power ynoughe / but as for ecclesyastycall gouernyng we ha¦ue lytell or none. In the meane tyme, he that knoweth myghte helpe / that ye colleges or preestes abbeys, and parysshes, & scoles / were well ruled and gouerned. For this also is the ecclesyasty∣call power, to make fewer colle∣ges, abbeys, and scoles where as no profite cōmeth of them. True¦ly it is better to haue no colleges nor abbeys at all, than to haue euyll rule or ordre in them, wher¦by god is greuously offended. THerfore whan the su∣peryours be froward, and suffre theyr offyce to decay, it must nea∣des folowe that they abuse theyr power, settynge forthe outwarde
euyll workes, bothe them selfe & to ye people / none otherwyse thā the father & mother, yf they com¦maunde any thynge contrarye vnto god. Here therfore we must beware & wyse. For the apostell shewed before, that suche peryl∣lous tymes shulde come / in the whiche suche superyours or offy¦cers shulde rule. Yet suche supe∣ryours haue this cloke to couer theyr iniquitie withall / to beare men in hande that they repyne & resyste the power of god / yf at a∣ny tyme what soeuer they statu∣te or ordayne, be vndone or let. Therfore let vs than take in our handes the thre fyrst cōmaunde∣mentes of god / and the ryght ta¦ble, beyng sure that no man, no∣ther bysshoppe nor pope / no nor aungels, maye ordayne or com∣maunde any thynge contrarye /
dysagreinge or repungnyng to ye thre fyrst cōmaūdemētes & theyr workes. But yf they go about ye contrary, it is nought worth no∣ther byndeth any man. And we also do synne obeyeng suche cō∣maundementes & constytucyōs / eyther doyng thē or twynkelyng at them. By this a man may ly∣ghtly perceyue / howe that sycke mē be not bounde wt the cōmaū∣demēt{is} of fastyng / nother womē great with chylde / nother they yt may not fast for any other cause wtout hurt. And yt we may serche this matter more groundelyer / There is nothyng nowe yt com∣meth from Rome / but ye marte & fayre of all thyng{is} of ye churche, which be opēly bought & solde wt out any shame / as {per}dōs, {per}ysshes abbeys, dioces, prelacy, benefy∣ces, & what soeuer was made &
ordayned in any place to the ho∣nour of god. By reason wherof all the ryches, goodes, and mo∣ney of all the worlde, be not one∣ly dryuen to Rome / which were but a lytell losse. But also parys∣shes, dyoces, and prelacy, be pul∣led, forsaken, and wasted. So that Goddes people is dyspysed and loste / the worde, name and glorie of god, be trode vnder fete fayth is dystroyed. and all to the ende that suche colleges and of∣fyces, maye be gyuen not onely vnto vnlerned, folysshe, and vn∣worthy / but also to Rome ron∣ners, the chefe heddes of al nou∣ghtye packes in the worlde. And so those thinges that were foun¦ded to the worshyp of god, to the fyndynge of prechers, whiche shulde rule and correcte the peo∣nowe spente vpon horses, horse
kepers, and moyles / Yea and yf I maye speake somwhat vnsha∣mefastly / vpon the whores and also whore hunters of Rome / of whom yet we haue no kyndnes, but be mocked vnto oure tethes lyke fooles. SEyng therfore ye all these intolle∣rable folysshenes be done vnder ye name of god and saynt Peter (as thoughe ye ecclesyastycall power were ordayned to haue ye glorye of god in shame & mockyng, & to distroye chrystyan cōmon welth bothe of bodye and soule.) We oughte vndoubtedlye to resyste them, as moche as we may. For here we muste folowe the exam∣ple of good chyldren / whose fa∣thers
be madde. And fyrste of all we muste loke from whense this lawe came / that suche thynges as were ordayned founded and gyuen to ye worshyppyng of god and bryngynge vp of our owne chyldren / shuld returne to ye vse, seruyce, & profyte of theym that lye at Rome, and nothyng to be done in the meane tyme here at home where it were most mete & cōuenyēt, Why be we so madde The bysshoppes and the chiefe of the church be here so slacke / yt they do not onely not resyst suche thynges / but also they feare, lest other wold resyst, & so they suffre yt chyrstyan cōmon welthe to pe∣rysshe. Fyrste of al let vs mekely call vpon god / thā let vs set vpō to redresse these myscheuous wt hande / stoppe the messyngers of Rome theyr waye / shewyng thē
lowly and gentylly / that yf they wolde rule theyr benefyces / they shulde be resydent vpon theym / feadyng the people wt preachyn∣ge & good example, which thyng yf they wyll not do / or els lye at Rome or other places, pyllyng & pollynge ye parysshes. Let ye pope or other fynde thē to whom they doo seruyce. For it is not mete yt we shulde fynde the bysshoppe of Rome / his offycers or cōmynal∣tie / ye rather his bawes & who∣res, with the losse & vndoynge of our soules. Lo these be the verye Turkes / whom kynges, prynces and gentylmen / shulde fyrste in∣uade / not for hope or remēbraū∣ce of theyr priuate welth, but for the loue onely of Chrystes cōmon welth / and to let the sclaunders hurtes / & blasphemye of the na∣me of god.How the bysshopp of Rome ought to be hande¦led with all his whā they bē out of the way. Thus therfore muste
suche spyrytuall {per}sones be han∣deled and regarded as a madde father / whiche excepte he be ta∣ken and let (whiche thynge yet must be with feare & reuerence.) may destroy bothe chyldren and patrymonye, & all that he hath. Soo truely shulde we take the power of Rome honourably, as  father / but whan they be madde and wood / they muste be let from theyr purpose / leaste by that the common welthe of Chryste be vndone. THere be some that thynke, that this shuld be referred to a generall counsell / but I say it is not to be done. For we haue had many counsels, in the whi∣che this matter hath ben had in hande / & especyally in the coun∣sell of Constance Basyll / and the
last at Rome / but yet there is no∣thynge fynysshed, so yt it is euer worse and worse. Nother do su∣che counsels profyte any thynge syns that the wysdome of Rome hath ymagyned this inuencyon / that kynges and prynces muste be fyrst bounde by an othe / that they shal suffre them styll to pos∣cesse & kepe that, that they haue without any dysturbance.Suche re∣questes and condycyons hath the bys∣shop of Ro∣me yt nowe is, Clement the .vii. ma∣de to ye pryn∣ces of Ger∣many / yea & moch worse, for a gene∣rall counsell to be hadde. And so they laye a barre and a stoppe to withstande all reformacyons, and to defēde theyr lybertie and lycence of all vngodlynesse. Al∣beit suche an othe made by vyo∣lynce agaynste god and ryghte / letteth the holy ghoste, whiche (they saye) beareth the rule in su∣che counsels. But this were the best & onely remedy that is lefte. Yf kynges, prynces, gentylmen, cytyes, and vniuersyties, wolde
take ye matter in hāde to reforme it theyr self{is}, & so handle it / that ye bysshops & spyrytualtie fearyng theyr cause / shuld haue an occasi¦on to folowe. For here is nothīge to be regarded: but ye fyrst cōmaū¦dement{is} of god / agaynst the whi¦che, nother pope, nor heuen / nor erth may forbyd or cōmaūde any thing, nother is ther any ieo{per}die in cursing{is} or thretenyng{is} / wher¦by they go aboute to let a laufull redressyō. Nomore thē it doth no hurt yf ye furyous father, greatly threten his sone, yt holdeth hym / & let hym fro his madde doynge. THe thyrde worke of this cō¦maundemēt is / to obey the temporall or seculer power, as Paule teachyth to the Romans, the .13. chapitre / and to Titus the fyrste chapytre / and saynt Peter
in his fyrst epystle the .2. chapitre sayeng Submyt your selfes vn∣to all men / other to the kynge, as chief / or to his offycers as sent of hym, to the punysshement of all yll doers / but for ye prayse of wel doers. The offyce of ye tēporall or seculer power is to defende theyr cōmons & subiectes / to punysshe thefte, brybery, and adulterie / as saynt Paule sayth to ye Romans the .13. chapyt. The hyghe power bereth not a swerde for noughte But he is the mynystre of god to take vēgeaūce of them yt do euyl: but to do good to thē / yt be good / Here than we synne .ii. maner of wayes. Fyrste whan we deceyue the seculer power, other by lyeng deceyte / or vnfaythfulnesse / and agayne whan we obey them not, byddynge, or cōmaundynge vs any thynge / whyther it muste be
done with body or goodes. For thoughe they do vniustly / as the kyng of Babylon dyd to ye chyl∣dre of Israell: yet god wolde yt we shuld obey them / without all disceyte or any begyle. Seconda¦rely, whan we backebyte them / & whan we be angrye and can not be auenged, whan we grudge a∣gaynst them, or hurte them with euyll wordes priuely or openly. In all these thynges we must re¦garde that, that saynt Peter cō∣maundeth vs to regarde / & spe∣cyally that theyr power can not hurte our soules, but onely oure bodyes and goodes / except they openly compell vs to do agaynst god, or vniustlye agaynste men / as the Heathen prynces compel∣led many Chrystyanes, before they came into Chrystes relygy∣on. And as it is sayd, the Turke
dothe nowe a dayes / for to suffre wrong hurteth not the soule, but maketh it better, thoughe it ta∣keth somwhat from the bodye or goodes. But vnryghtuous do∣ynge dystroyeth the soule / yea thoughe thou gette all the good of the worlde. ANd this is ye cau∣se, yt there is not so great peryll in the seculer power whan it doth yll / as in the spirytuall or ecclesyas∣tycall power. For the seculer or temporall power can not hurte / in as moche as they meddyll not with preachynge and sermons, and with faythe / & the thre fyrste cōmaundementes of god. But the ecclesiastycall power hurteth not onely, doyng vnryghtwyse∣nesse.
But also whan they leaue theyr duetye, and do that that is not theyr duetye / yea thoughe it were better than the best work{is} / that the seculer power doth. And therfore suche men muste be re∣systed whā they do wrōg{is} / & not ye temporal powers / all thoughe they lyue contrarye to theyr of∣fyces. For the poore cōmon peo∣ple so folowe the ecclesyastycall power in belefe and in lyfe, that both they be blynde as betelles, and knowe neyther what to be∣leue, nor to do. Furthermore the ecclesyastycal power was orday¦ned for nothyng els / but to bryn¦ge the people by faythe to god / the whiche thynges be not in the temporall or seculer power. For whether the temporall powers do these thynges or leaue them vndone after theyr owne myn∣de
/ yet my faythe goeth forthe neuerthelesse / her way workyng by it selfe / and not compelled to byleue by theyr example. Wher∣fore the temporall power is of verye lytell force before god to hurte any mans soule, & of moch lesse reputacyon & weyght, than that for the euyll lyfe or good lyfe of it, we shulde moue any se¦dicyon, dysobedyence, and deba∣te. And agayne the spirytuall & ecclesyastycall power is a great good and excellent thynge, & of more hyghe value before god / than that the least chrysten man shulde suffre them / and not to speke to thē, yf they ones swarue one heare brede from theyr of∣fyce. I wyll not say, yf they go vtterly agayne theyr offyce / as we se nowe dayly.
THere be many abu∣ses in this tēporall or seculer power. Fyrst, whan they yt enioye the dygnytie do folowe the counsell of flatte∣rers / whiche is a cōmon and mer¦uaylous hurtefull dystruccyon and pestylence / and can not be a∣uoyded to moche. And in this poynte the offycers be ledde (as men saye) by the nose, to ye great hurte and euyll of the myserable people / bycause that where men be so ledde, there is cōmenly su∣che gouernaūce, as the Ethnyke speketh of. That lyke as the spy∣der webbes be stronge ynoughe to holde faste flyes, where as the mylne stones brast through thē, and go theyr wayes. Euen so ye poore people be holden wt lawes constytucyons, and rules / the
great men scapynge and at ly∣bertie. Therfore where as the lorde or prynce is not so wyse by hym selfe, so bolde & vertuous, that he nedeth not the coūsell of other / there muste nedes be (ex∣cepte god shewe a peculyar my∣racle) a chyldysshe rulynge and gouernaūce. Therfore almygh∣ty god amōges all other plages & troubles, nombreth & iudgeth euyll and folysshe offycers, prin∣ces, and rulers / with whome he thretened to punysshe ye people / Esaye the .iii. chap. I shall gyue chyldren to be theyr prynces / & effamynate mē shall haue power ouer theym. And truely god in scrypture hathe thretened foure plages or punysshementes, Ese∣chiell the .xiii. chapy. The fyrste is the pestylence moste poysoned & deadely, whiche Dauyd chose.
The seconde hungre / the thyrde swerde or batell / the fourthe, e∣uyll beastes and lyons, wolues, serpentes, and dragons / wherby bē sygnyfyed euyll gouernours. For where as suche rulers be / ye countrey hath not myschefe and losse onely in theyr bodyes, goo∣des, and ryches, & all other thyn¦ges / but also in fame, honoure, lernyng, vertue, and in helthe of theyr soules. For pestylence and hungre maketh men good and ryghtwyse. But warres and yll rulers losse & dystroye bothe all temporall goodes perpetuall. IT is also the due∣tye of a synguler wyse prince, not to punysshe alway wt dethe, thoughe he haue neuer so good and iuste a
cause. For it is moche more ex∣cellent vertue that he do harme or losse to his lawe / than to the goodes or bodyes of his subiec∣tes, yf it may be to the profyte of his cōmons or subiectes. In as∣moche as ye temporall lawes re∣garde onely temporall thynges. Therfore this is a folysshe say∣enge, the lawe is with me in this matter / wherfore with myghte & power I wyll reuenge it & kepe it / ye thoughe all other shulde be wrapped in ieoperdye and mys∣chiefe.Octauian themperour. We rede that the Empe∣roure Octauyan wolde neuer more make any warre, had he ne¦uer so ryght a cause / onelesse he were sure yt he shulde warre for more profyte than hurte, or at ye leste with tollerable losse. In so moche that he was wont to say / that warryours were lyke them
that fysshed wt a golden hooke / whiche whan it is loste, can ne∣uer be recompensed by takynge of fysshe. For he that leadeth a waggen, muste nedes go other∣wyse than he that goeth a lone. For he yt goeth alone may kepe this way & that way as he wyll / but the caryer or carter muste nowe turne this way / nowe that waye, as his cart or horses may folowe hym / whome he must re∣garde & not his owne wyll. So it is necessarye that a prynce or a lorde guydynge an hooste / go forth not after his owne mynde, but by the power and cōmodytie of his hooste / more regardynge the profyte, nede, and cōmodytie of his companye / than his owne wyll and pleasure. For a prynce or a lorde cōmaundynge or ru∣lynge after the mynde and luste
of his owne brayne and folysshe hede / is lyke a madde caryer or carter, that dryueth horse & carte headelynge, throughe busshes & groues, dyches, poddelles, wa∣ters, hylles, and dales / and ney∣ther loketh for wayes nor bryd∣ges / suche a carter shall not lōge carye but breake his wagen all to peces. And therfore it were most profytable for prynces and kyng{is} that they rede, or els cause to be redde to theym / euen from theyr chyldhode. As well the sto∣ryes of scrypture, as of the gen∣tylles / for they shuld fynde more lernynge, and more examples, to rule and gouerne in them / thā in all the bokes of lawe and de∣crees / as we rede in the reygne of the kynge of Persie, in the .vi. chapytre of Hesters. For we be euer taughte more by examples
and storyes, than by lawes, de∣crees, & constytucyons, bycause that in suche examples & hysto∣ryes / sure experyence teacheth vs, and here bare wordes teache vs.Prynces, lordes with other noble men shulde exerise them selfes in .iii. maner of workes. All prynces, noble men and lordes, shulde haue thre specyall workes / which they may do, spe∣cyally in our countrey. The fyrst that they anulle the horryble a∣busage of eatynge & drynkyng / not onely for the vnmeasurable∣nesse of it / but for loue and cha∣rytie. For by swete meates and sawces, without the which a mā may lyue well ynoughe / no lytel losse of tēporall goodes is crepte and dayly entreth into this lāde. In takyng awaye of the which two hurtes / the temporal power shulde haue ynoughe to do / for they be deply roted. Howe shuld the prynces serue god better, thā
to make theyr owne regyōs mo∣re plentuous? The seconde is to take away ye vnmeasurable wast of apparell and rayment, in the which so moche good is wasted / and that onely for the pleasure of the worlde and the flesshe / yt it is fearefull to thynke on it / that there shulde be such mysuse foū∣de amonges the people, gyuen & sworne to Chryst / baptysed and dedycate to beare his crosse with hym / and dayly preparynge our selfe to dethe. If this were done vnauysed, it myght the better be sufferde. But nowe whan it is done so boldely, so vnponysshed, so vnshamefastly / and so that no man letteth it, gayne sayeth it, nor resysteth it: yea rather glory and prayse is gotten by it / it is an vngodly, & an vnholy thyng, not becommynge chrysten men.
The thyrde is to expelle and put awaye all pensyones and fayres of vserye / by the whiche all men, countreys, and cyties, throughe out all the worlde / be corrupte, wasted, destroyed, and loste / and that by ye vngracyous cloke and coloure whiche they make to the ende that it shulde not be called vserye / as to resygne a benefyce vpon a pencyon, & than redeme it for money / & yet it is in dede worse than vserye, bycause it is not exchued, as vsery is before. These ben the thre Iewes whi∣che (accordyng to the cōmen pro¦uerbe) sucke vp, waste, and con∣sume all the whole worlde. In this poynte therfore ye prynces, noble men, & lordes oughte not to slepe nor be slouthfull, yf they wyll gyue a good accompte of theyr offyce before god.
HEre also myght be shewed the wycked¦nesse, famylyer, & greatly vsed of the offycyalles & other the bysshoppes & spirytuall offy∣cers, whiche excommunycate the poore people, and handell them and vexe theym with great bur∣dens and troubles / so longe as they haue one farthynge lefte. Suche thynges shulde be let by the seculer power / seyng yt there is no other remedye / nor helpe. O I wold to god yt there myght be ones suche a cōmon welth or∣deyned / whiche wold take away all stewes / as it was in the peo∣ple of Israell / for it is an vnho∣ly, & an vnchrystyan sygne / that chrysten men shuld haue an hou¦se ordeyned for cōmon synnes / ye whiche thyng in olde tyme was
not herde of. Therfore it wolde be conuenyent, that there were a cōstytucyon & ordenaunce made that men shulde be maryed bety¦mes to maydes, to auoyde suche myscheues / in the whiche thyng shuld labour bothe spyrytuall & temporall rulers / aswell the spy¦rytuall as the seculer offycyals / And yf this was possyble amon∣ges the Iewes / why shuld it not be possyble among{is} chrystē men. And agayne yf it be possyble in some stretes, castels, townes and cytyes / as we se byfore our iyes / why is it not possyble ī euery pla¦ce? But this letteth it / that there is no good gouernaunce in all ye worlde / no man wyll take payne And herof it cōmeth that ye craf∣tes men be fayne to let theyr ser∣uauntes kepe holye daye / whi∣che be so ryotous yt no man may
let them. But & yf there were an constytucyon and an ordynaun∣ce / that they shuld be compelled to obserue and obey / and yt they shuld not be receyued of any mā in any other place / there shuld be a great hole stopped to this mys∣chefe / Oh god helpe / I trowe, this be to greate a desyre / And lytle hope I haue that it wyll be reformed all that. Now se yt here be but fewe work{is} / declared to prynces / lordes, and offycers / but yet they be so good / and so many / yt they may haue ynough to do / wherin they maye serue god euery houre / Nowe muste these workys also / no lesse than all other work{is} be done in fayth Let no mā presume to plese god by his workes / but as by truste towarde god / that he doth suche workes to his mercyfull & gen∣tyll
god / onely for the honoure & glory of god so must he do them and so serue & profyt his neygh∣boure in them. THe fourthe worke of this cōmaūdemēt / is obedyence of seruaun¦tes & craftes men to∣warde theyr lordes and ladyes, masters & maystres. Of whome / speaketh saynt Paule to Tytus the seconde chapyter / let the ser∣uauntes be obedyente to theyr masters, pleasynge them in all thynges not speakynge agynste them / but shewynge good fayth in all thyng{is} / yt they may garnys¦she the doctryne of our sauyour in all thynges / that he, which is agaynste you maye be afrayde, hauyng no euyll to speke of you Saynt peter sayd also / seruaun¦tes
obey your masters with all feare / not onlye yf they be good and curtoys, but also yf they be froward / for it cōmeth of grace / yf a man for consyence towarde god, endure grefe / suffrynge it vniustly / yea & nowe ye greattest cōplaynt in ye worlde is agaynst seruauntes and worke mē / that they be so stubbourne / so vnthrif¦ty / so euyll manered / and so desy¦rouse of auauntage / And this trouble is sent of god / For this obedyence / is the onlye worke of seruauntes / wherwith they may be blessed / so that they neade not pylgrymages to sayntes / nother yet this deade nor that / yf theyr herte only bowe vnto obedyence that they be redy to do and leaue vndone what soeuer they know shal please theyr masters & theyr wyues / & that al in playne fayth
Not yt they wolde deserue great thynges by theyr workes / but that they do theym all in truste of the loue and grace of god / in the which stande al deseruyng{is} / and that they come purelye and frelye of suche loue / desyre, and truste in god / so that they suffer such workes to be an exercysyng and monysshynge to stablysshe suche a faythe more and more / For as I haue sayd ofte tymes / this faythe maketh all workes good / ye all work{is} must be done of fayth / so yt fayth is the master of workes. The master & maystres duty towar¦de theyr ser∣uaūtes.OF the other parte the masters & maystres, muste rule theyr ser∣uaūtes and maydes, and worke men not cruelly / not sekynge all thynges to the quy∣cke
/ but fuffer some thynges / as thoughe they se nowe them not for peace and vnyte / for seynge in this erthelye lyfe / we lyue in vnperfytnes / all thyng{is} can not be done to the poynte in no de∣gre or state / of the whiche sayth saynt Paule to ye Collosyans, ye 4. chapyter / ye masters do vnto your seruauntes yt / which is iust & equall / remembryng also that you haue a master in heuē / And therfore as the masters wolde not that god shulde do extreme∣ly with them / but to be forgyuē many thynges by his grace / so they ought therfore to be more meke to theyr seruaunt{is} / forgy∣uynge them many thynges / yet they must take hede / that they ly¦ue well / and that they learne to serue god. Here thou seyst agay∣ne / what good workes / the good
man and good wyfe of the house maye do / howe goodly / howe ny∣ghe, howe ofte, and howe many wayes / doth he moue & set forth good workes to vs all? that we neade not to aske for good wor∣kes / that be far from vs and in∣uēted by man / as by goyng pyl∣grymage / buyldynge churches / sekynge of perdones / and suche other / Here also I shuld speake / howe the wyfe ought to obey / be vnder gyue place, gyue few wor¦des / & suffer her husbāde / as her superyour & master / where as it is not agaynst god / And agayn howe the husbande shulde / loue & cherysshe his wyfe / not requy∣rynge euery thynge to the vtter∣moste / as saynt Peter & Paule haue spoken manye thynges of this matter / but this thynge is meter for a longer declaracyon
than the .x. commaundementes / and it maye be lyghtlye knowen by these chap. BVt what soeuer is spokē of these wor¦kes / it is compre∣hēded in these two obedyence and bu∣synes. For obedyence becōmyth the people or subiectes / busynes besemyth masters or su{per}yours, that they care for theyr subiectes to rule them well / to handle thē curteysly and gently / and to do all thynges that maye profyt & helpe thē / for this is theyr waye to heuen / these be the best work{is} that they can do in the world / by the whiche / they be more accep∣table to god / than yf they other wyse dydde pure myracles / So sayth saint Paule to ye Romans
the .12. chapyter / he that ruleth in busynes / As thoughe he shulde saye / Lette hym not be moued what other men, or other orders do / nother let hym loke of this worke, nor of that / whyther it shyneth goodly or seme obscure / but let hym take hede of his one condycyon / remēbryng his state, howe he maye profyt his subiec∣tes / and there let hym abyde / not sufferyng hym self to be plucked from them, no, not by ye {per}suasy∣on of angelles in heuen / nor by temptacyons of ye deuyll in hell, this is a redye waye bryngynge hym to heuen. Oh that yf any man wolde thus keape hym felf and his degree / and wolde do this one thyng / how ryche shuld he be shortly of good workes so pryuelye and so closelye that no man shulde perceyue it but god?
but nowe all these lefte vndone / one rōneth in to ye Charterhowse an other hyther / & an other thy∣ther / as though good workes & the cōmaundement{is} of god / we∣re caste downe / and thruste in to corners / and yet it is wryten in the fyrste chapytre of the prouer¦bes / that ye wysdome of god she∣wed forth her cōmaundementes open in the stretes, in the cheyfe of the people / & in the gat{is} of the cytie / wherby is sygnyfyed / that they be euer plenteous, & abun∣daunt in all plac{is}, states, degres & tymes. But we be so blynded / that we se them not / in any place and so seke other workes / ye whi¦che thynge Chryste hath shewed byfore / Mathewe the .2.4. yf any man shall saye vnto you / lo here is Chryste or there is Chreste / by¦leue hym not yf they saye / lo he
is in wyldernes / go not out / lo he is in the inwarde houses / by∣leue them not / for there shall ary¦se many false anoynted and fal∣se prophetes. AGayne obedyēce is conuenyēt for the subiectes / yt they vse all theyr labour & dylygē∣ce doynge and leuynge of that / that theyr superyours requyre / not suffryng them selfe to be put or plucked from thense / nother regardynge what other do / No∣ther let them thynke / that they do wel / or do any good workes, whyther they praye or faste / or what name soeuer it hath if they exercyse not them selfes in this obedyence / But yf there be any thynge cōmaunded by the secu∣ler
power (there as is oft tymes) that is contrarye or a let to god∣des cōmaundementes / than the∣re endeth obedyence / there is the dutye anulled / for here muste be sayde / that saynt Petre sayde to the rulers of ye Iewes / We must obey more god than men. He say¦de not, we muste not obey men / for that were false / but we must obey more god than men / so we muste nother helpe nor obey the prynce / that wyll keape warre / hauynge an īiuste cause openlye knowen / For god hath cōmaun∣ded that we shulde not slee oure neyghbour / Nether do hym wrō¦ge / or hurte hym wrongfullye. Also yf the temporall power cō∣maūde vs to beare false wytnes to lye, to robbe, to decyue, & such other / we shulde rayther despyse goodes honour / bodye and lyfe /
than do it / so yt the cōmaūdemēt of god myght be saued & hole. ¶The fyfth cōmaunde∣ment of god. THe foure fyrste com¦maundementes ha¦ue theyr workes in reason / that is, they take, rule & gouer∣ne man, and subdue hym / that he rule not hym self / yt he thynke not hym selfe good, that he iud∣ge no great thynge of hym self / but that he knowlege hym selfe demure and lowe / sufferynge to be ruled / wherby pryde is with∣stande and resysted. But these cō¦maundemētes, that folowe, med¦le with the lustes and desyres of men / to slee theyr lustes also. And fyrste of all this angrye lust and desyre of punysshement / of
the whiche speketh this fyfth cō∣maundement, thou shalt not slee This cōmaundement hathe one worke / conteynynge many / and puttynge awaye many vyces / & it is called gentylnes or pacyen∣ce / the whiche is two maner of wayes. Wherof ye one apperyth goodly & beautefull / but it hath nothynge inwarde. This gentyl¦nes or pacyence / we haue to our frendes, & to them whiche be pro¦fytable vnto vs, in ryches, fame dygnyte, labour & fauour. This gentylnes also we haue to them that nother dysplease nor hurte vs in worde nor deade, suche gē∣tylnes is also in dombe beest{is} as Lyons and serpens / in hetahen men, Iewes, Turkes, Knaues, mansleers, and harlottes. For al these be peaceable and quyet / yf thou folow theyr wyl / or yf thou
dysplease them not / And yet ma∣nye be deceyued by suche tryfe∣lynge gentylnes / clokynge theyr yre / and excuse them selfe after this facyon / saynge I wold not be angry yf I myght be in reste for other / euen so the deuyll wol¦de be content / gentyll and peace able / yf all myght come after his mynde / But to this entent do dyssensyon and dyspleasure in∣uade the / that they maye shewe the to thy selfe / howe full of yre and malyce thou arte / that thou so warned / mayst labour for gē∣tylnes and pacyence / and to cast out wrath / The other gentylnes is good and cōmeth from ye rote and grounde of the herte / and sheweth hym lelfe to his aduer∣saryes and enemyes not hurtīge them / not iudgynge them / not abhorrynge them / not cursynge
them, not backebytynge them, not spekynge or thynkyng euyll of them / ye though they had ta∣ken from vs / goodes, fame, bo∣dye, frendes / and to be shorte all that euer we had / but rather in what soeuer we maye / we do good to them for euyll / spekyng the best of them / thynkynge the beste of them / and prayenge for theym. Of the whiche speaketh Chryst in the .6. chapitre of Ma∣thewe. Do ye good to thē, that do euyll to you / praye for them that persecute and trouble you. And saynt Paule to ye Romanes the .12. chapytre / say well & curse not / yeldynge euyll for euyll to no man. NOw se howe this excellēt and hyghe worke is gone to nought amonges chrystē mē,
that nowe nothyng reyneth but stryfe, chydyng, warre, yre, hate, enuye, backbytyng, cursyng, ab∣horrynge, hurtes, vengeaunce, and all maner of yre and dysday¦ne / bothe in worde and deade in euery place. And yet neuerthe∣lesse we procede styll / with many holy dayes / hearynge masses / mumblyng of prayers / buyldyn¦ge of churchs / and garnysshyn∣ge the same, albeit wihout any cōmaundement of god / and so vnmoderatly as though we we∣re moste holy of all chrysten men that euer were / suffrynge vnder these glasses & dysfygured wor∣kes / the cōmaundement{is} of god to lose and decaye. In so moche that there is not one that thyn∣keth or remembreth howe nygh he is vnto gentylnes, kyndnesse, pacyentnes, and vnto the fulfyl¦lynge
of this cōmaundement of god. Notwithstandyng yet that god sayd not, he that doth these workes, but he that kepeth his cōmaundementes / shulde entre in to the kyngdome of heauen. For as moch then as there is no man lyuynge in this worlde / to whom god hath not gyuē an vt∣terar of his owne yre and maly∣ce, that is to wyt, his enemye or aduersary hurtyng hym in god∣des dygnytie, honour, and fren∣des to proue whither there be a∣ny yre lefte in hym or no / why∣ther he can loue his ennemye / speake well of hym / do for hym do good to hym / thynkynge no euyll agaynst hym / Nowe lette hym come that wyll, and aske / what good workes he shall do, that may be plesaunt to god and helthfull to hym felfe / & let hym
sette his enemye before his face / let hym haue hym contynuallye in the ymage and iye of his her∣te / for this cause / that he maye ouercome hym selfe / vsynge his herte to thynke frendly of hym, to fauoure hym after the beste maner / to care & praye for hym: and after whan ther is occasyon or tyme / not onely to speake wel of hym / but also to do him good lette hym proue this / that wyll and yf he haue not ynoughe to do all the dayes of his lyfe / lette hym reproue me of a lye / and let hym saye / this sayenge is false. But nowe whan god wyll haue this thynge done and admytteth nor requyreth no lesse payment / but this kyndnes to our enemye what I beseche you doth it pro∣fyt vs to be busye in other great workes not cōmaunded / and to
leaue these cōmaunded vndone, therfore sayth Chryst, Mathew the fyfte chapytre. I saye vnto you / he that is angrye with his brother, is gylty of iugement / he that saith to his brother Racha, that is / whiche gyueth an abho∣mynable angry, and cruel sygne of wrathe, is gylty of counsell. He that sayth foole / that is / he yt gyueth any maner of cheke, bac¦kebyteth, slaundreth or curseth, is gyltye of euerlastynge fyre / where abydeth than the vyolent layenge of hādes? as to stryke, to cut, to wounde, to kyll and to hurt, yf the thoughtes & wordes of yre be so greuously dampned. BVt where as is the inward gētylnes, kyndnes, & pacy∣ence of the herte / there the herte hath petye of all yt troubles that
happen to his enemye / and such be the true chyldren and heyres of god and bretherne of Chryst, whiche dyd the same for vs vp∣on the crosse. Euyn lykewyse, as we se in a good iudge whiche is ryght sory and lothe to gyue sen∣tence vpon the gyltye person / & is heuye of the deth put to hym by the lawe. Here in the iudge is a shew in the worke, as though there were yre, dysdayne, & im∣pacyētnesse / but in wardly there is very sorow and pacyence aby∣dynge vnder suche ioyfull wor∣kes / and it than swarmeth most quyckely & louyngly in ye herte, whan it is constrayned so to be angrye and to exercyse seueryte But here we must beware, that we be not gentyll and peace a∣gaynst the glorye and cōmaun∣ementes of god. For it is wryt¦ten,
that Moyses was gentylest of all men / & yet whā the Iewes had prouoked and moued god, by the worshyppyng of a golden calfe he kylled many of them / & by that gate agayne the fauour of god. So the offycers and su∣peryours ought not to kepe the holy day, and suffre synne to rey¦gne / & they in the meane tyme to say nothyng vnto it. I ought to despyce my honoure / my ry∣thes, my losse, my hurte, nor to be angrye yf any aduersytie hap¦pen vnto me / but we must regar¦de the commundementes of god, and also defende and put awaye the hurte and wronge of our ney¦ghboure. And the offycers and rulers must punysshe other / that is to saye, priuate persones with wordes and rebukes. And yet al these ought to be done with com¦passyon
vpon them that haue de¦serued punysshement / For this hyghe goodlye and pleasaunte worke, suffereth her selfe to be obtaygned easely yf we do it in faythe, and exercyse faythe in it / not doubtyng in the fauour and grace of god / it shall be a lyghte thynge for hym to be mercyfull and kynde to his neyghboure / howe moche soeuer he hathe offended hym / for we haue offended god more gre∣uouslye and cruelly. Lo howe shorte a commaundement this is. But there is a longe & great exercyse of good workes & faythe set forthe in it. ¶The syxe cōmaundement thou shalte be no Lecher.
ALso in this com∣maundement is a worke commaun∣ded contaynynge many good wor∣kes, and puttynge awaye many vyces / and it is called clennesse or chastytie / of the whiche many thynges be wrytten, shewed and knowen well to many. But it is not so well obserued and kepte as be other workes not cōmaun¦ded. So redy we be al to do that that is not cōmaūded / & to leaue that, ehat is cōmaunded. We se that the worlde is full of fythye workes of vnclennesse, vnshame fast word{is}, bawdy tales and son¦ges. And besydes these, the pro∣uokyng is dayly increasyd with to moch meate and drynke / ydel∣nesse, and gorgeous apparell. And yet we go forthe styll, as
thoughe we were chrysten men, bycause we go to the churche / whype vp our prayers, fast and keape holy dayes, wherby we thynke all perfyte. But & yf there were no more workes cōmaun∣ded but chastytie / we had all bu∣synes ynoughe to do. For this byce is so peryllous and outragy¦ous, yt it rageth in all our mem∣bres / in the herte by thoughtes, in the iyes by syght, in the eares by hearynge, in the mouth by wordes, in the handes, fete, and all the body, by worke it selfe. And to tame all these we muste laboure and punysshe our selfe / so the cōmaundementes of god teche vs. How moch howe true∣lye, howe syncerely suche good work{is} ben exercysed god know∣eth. Yea it is vnpossyble for vs to thynke any good thyng of our
owne power / I wyll not saye to begynne or fynisshe it. For saynt Augustyne sayeth / that amōges all chrysten mens battelles / the batell of chastytie is ye greattest, bycause it is dayly without cea∣synge or leauynge of / & bycause that chastytie seldome ouercom∣meth. All sayntes haue complay¦ned vpon this / and all holy men haue bewayled it / as saynt Pau¦le to the Romaynes the .7. chap. For I know that there dwelleth nat in me, that is in my flesshe any goodnes. THat the worke of chastytie may haue the hygher han∣de,Saye not a¦nother tyme that the new lernynge (as the papystes call it) forby∣deth tastyng watchynge, labour, with other chaste∣synge of the bodye. it dryueth vs to many other good workes / as to fastynges & temperaunce / agaynst gloto∣ny & dronkennes, to watchynge & erlye rysynge / agaynst slouth &
vnmeasurable slepe, to laboure and werynesse agaynst ydelnes. For alwayes to eate, drynke, sleape, sytte styll, and be ydelyd / ben the armoure, defence, & no∣rysshynge of vnclennesse / by the whiche chastytie is ouercome by and by. And vpō the other syde the holy apostle Paule calleth fastynge, watchynge, laboure / the armure of god, by the which vnclennesse is tamed & broughte in ordre. But yet so as is sayd be¦fore / that suche exercysynges go no further, than to oppresse vn∣clennesse / and not to destroye na∣ture. Besydes all these, the moste stronge wepen is prayer and the worde of god / that whan ye euyll luste and desyre prycketh a mā / than let hym fle to prayer / cal∣lynge vpon the grace and helpe of god. Let his mynde be occu∣pyed
vpon it, lokyng in the pas∣syon of Chryst. So sayeth he, in the .137. psalme. O cytye of Ba∣bell, worthye to be dystroyed / blessid be he that shal take thyne yonge babes / and throwe them agaynste the stones / that is to saye, whan the herte is infecte / with euyll thoughtes / beyng yet tender / and in the begynnyng, ronneth to our lorde chryst, whi∣che is ye stone, by the whiche they be brused, broken, & dystroyed. Lo here euery man laden in hym selfe, shall fynde good busynesse ynoughe to do good workes in hym selfe. But nowe it is so yt no man vseth prayer, fastyng, wat∣ching, & labour, for this purpose, but for a clene cōtrary intent, Al¦beit they were ordayned & made onely to fulfyl ye worke of this cō¦maūement, & to purge it euery
day more & more. Besydes this, there haue ben some men whych haue shewed howe vnclennesse myghte be auoyded, as by lea∣uynge of softe beddes / pleasaūt chambres, gorgeous rayment / as well in men, as in women / to famylyer cōmunycacyon & coun¦tenaūce / and what soeuer other thyng is {pro}fitable to kepe chasty¦tie / in all the whiche thyng{is} no man can put a certayne rule or measure. But euery man muste marke hym selfe / what thinges, how many, & howe longe they be {pro}fytable for hym to kepe chasty¦tie, & must chose them hym selfe. But and yf he know not by hym selfe, let hym submytte hym selfe a whyle to the instruccyon and lernynge of another / the whiche maye brynge hym vp & instructe hym in it, vntyll he be able to ru∣le
hym selfe. For truely the ab∣beys & monasteryes were ones founded for this cause. That chyldren and yonge men myght be taught good¦nesse and chastytie in them. A Good & stron¦ge fayth pro∣fyteth more sensablye in this worke, than it shuld in any other. In so moche,The gyrdell of the reynes that Esaye calleth fayth the gyrdell of the reynes / that is to saye, the kepynge of chastytie. For spirytual chastytie pleaseth hym that lyueth in it so well that he promyseth and thyn¦keth hym self sure of the grace and fauoure of god. Therfore
by this he may the more strong∣ly resyste bodely vnclennesse / for ye spyrite of god sheweth hym for certayne, howe he ought in such fayth to exchue euyll thoughtes and what soeuer is contrary vn∣to chastytie. For as this trust of ye grace of god lyueth workynge all workes, without any inter∣myssyon, euyn so it forsaketh no holsome admonyssion in thyng{is} that be pleasaunt to god, or dys∣pleasaunt. As saynt Iohn̄ sayth in his epystell. I haue not wryt∣ten vnto you, as thoughe you were ignoraūt of the truthe, but as to them that knowe it. For ye haue oyntement of ye holy ghost, and ye knowe all thynges / that is ye spiryte of god teacheth you al thynges. Nother must we dis∣payre, though we be not delyue∣red by and by from tempacyon.
Yea we ought not to determyne that we shulde haue any reste of it so longe as we lyue / nother to take it any other wayes / but as a prouokyng and warnynge / to pray, to fast, to watch, to labour, & other exercysyng{is}, to tame the flesshe / & specyally for to haue & do suche thyng{is} to vse our fayth towarde god. For yt chastytie is not great that hathe quyete rest / but that whiche commeth in ba∣tayle and fyghteth with vnclen∣nesse without ceasyng, expellyng all poysons / that the flesshe & the euyll spiryte cast vnto vs / so sayeth saynt Peter. Derely belo∣ued I besech you as vnacquayn¦ted and straungers, to abstayne your self from flesshely desyres / whiche stryue agaynst the soule. And saynt Paule to the Romay∣nes the .6. chapyt. Let not synne
reygne in youre mortall body ye ye obey his lustes. In this sen∣tence and suche other, is shewed ye no man is fre frō euyll lustes / but that we be compelled daylye to fyght wt them. And all though this conflycte brynge payne and trouble vnto our flesshe / yet it is a pleasaunt worke to god, in the whiche oughte onely to be oure pleasure and comforte. For they that thynke that they shal with∣stande suche tēptacyon in quyet∣nesse / they kyndell and inflame it more and more / so ye al though it resteth a lytell whyle / yet it cō∣meth agayne more strōger / fyn∣dynge nature more weake than it was before. ¶The .vii. cōmaundement thou shalte do no thefte.
ANd this cōmaunde∣mēt hath a worke cō¦taynyng many good workes in hym, con∣trary to many vyces / whiche is called lyberalytie / the whiche is suche a worke, that a mā is redy & mete to profyte & socoure all men wt his goodes / stryuyng not onely agaynst thefte & robbery / but also agaynst all dysceytes & gyles / which may be done in tē∣poral good{is} of one man agaynst a nother. As be couetyce, vserye, to great pryce, counterfete mea∣sure, and coūterfete wayght / for who can nōbre all newe discey∣tes & subtyll inuencyons which be euery day increased ī all mer∣chaūdyse, in the whiche all men seke theyr owne lucre & profyte / with the dysprofyte of other, forgettyng the sayeng of Chryst
Mathew the .7. chapytre. What soeuer ye wyll that men do vnto you, do the same to them. Yf eue∣ry man hauyng this rule before his iyes, wolde kepe it in his oc∣cupacyon, in his merchaundyse and dedes. He shuld fynde howe he ought to bye and sell, to take, lende, & gyue frelye / to promyse and fulfyll with such other. For yf we beholde the busynes and crafte of this worlde / and howe great a swynge couetyce hathe in them / we shulde not alonlye haue busynes ynoughe (so yt we, wolde lyue with god & honour), but we shulde also quake and be a ferde of this peryllous & wret∣ched lyfe / that is troubled, ouer∣cōmed and taken with care of temporall goodes / & his myscheuous gettynges.
WHerfore it was not without a cause, that the wyse man sayd / blessyd is yt man that is foūde without spotte / & hath not gone after golde / nother hathe truste in the treasoure of money. Whi∣che is he, & we shall prayse hym / for he hathe done myracles in his lyfe / as thoughe he wolde saye / there is none, or at the least very fewe, that knowe and per∣ceyue in them selfe suche gredy∣nes, desyre, and loue of money. For here couetyce hathe a good∣ly couer of shame and vyce, whi¦che is called bodely sustenaunce and necessytie of nature / vnder the whiche, couetyce laboureth so immoderatly and vnsacyably that a man must beware to kepe hym selfe clene / that as ye wyse
man sayeth / he may worke my∣racles in his lyfe. Nowe se that this lyberall man shall not one∣lye do good work{is} / but also my∣racles whiche maye please god & be praysed. What nede hathe he than to ymagen or loke for a∣ny other? Let hym take hede of hym selfe / and let hym beware that he go not after golde / nor yt put he truste in the treasure of money / but suffre the money to fololowe hym / and that money abyde for his sake, & not he for the money sake / that he loue not the money, nother that his herte be sette in it. Thus is he very ly∣berall a worker of myracles and a blessyd mā. And as Iobe sayd in ye .31. chap. I neuer thoughte golde my strength, neyther haue I trusted ī it. And the .6.2. Whā youre ryches increase, put not
your hertes to thē. And Chryste the .6. of Mathewe. Be ye not carefull, sayeng that what shall we eate? or what shal we weare? for ye gentyls aske all these thin∣ges. And ye father ī heuen know∣eth yt you nede al these / But here perauenture some well say / well truste thou not to that, and care not, & loke whā the rosted henne shall flye into thy mouth.Care is for∣bydden and not laboure. True∣ly I say not that no man shulde laboure / but that we shulde not be full of care, and desyre coue∣touslye, and that we shulde not mystruste, but yt we shulde haue ynough / for we be all iudged to laboure in Adam / for god sayd. Genesis the .iii. chapytre. Thou shalte eate thy breade in ye swete of thy face / & Iobe the .v. A man is borne to laboure and a byrde to flye / but euyn as the byrde
flyeth not with care, busynes & couetyce / so we ought to labour without care and couetyse / but and yf thou care for byrdes and wolde the rosted chekyn shulde flye into thy mouthe / care and be busye lokynge whether thou mayste fulfyll the cōmaundemē∣tes of god or no, yt thou mayste be made blessyd. Care com∣meth of infy¦delytie.TRewe fayth teacheth this worke by her sel∣fe / for the herte that thynketh surely that it hath god mercyfull & louynge vnto hym: howe is it possyble yt he shulde be carefull and coue∣tyce? for it must nedes be yt god taketh hym and defendeth hym. And therfore he stycketh in no money / but he vseth it wt a mery lyberalytie, to the profyte of his
neyghbour / knowyng yt he shall haue ynoughe, howe moche soe∣uer he dystrybuteth or gyueth for his god, in whom he trusteth wyll not dysceyue hym, nother forsake hym. As it is in the .36. psalme. Verely I haue ben yōge and olde / and yet sawe I neuer the ryghtwyse forsaken, or his sede beggyng theyr brede.Why the A∣postell cal∣leth couetyse ydolatrye. Ther¦fore ye apostell called none other synne ydolatrye, than couetyce / whiche vttereth it selfe grossely / how it trusteth nothyng in god / trustynge to haue more good by his money than by god / by the whiche trust as is sayd before / god is other truely honoured, or els sclaūdred. And verely in this cōmaundement it may be clerely perceyued, howe all good work{is} muste come out and be done in faythe / for here euery man per∣perceyueth
by a meruaylous su∣renesse / that as faythe is ye cause of lyteralytie / so vnfaythfulnes is the cause of couetyce / for he yt trusteth in god is lyberal, doub∣tynge nothyng but that he shall euer haue ynough. And contra∣ry he that trusteth not in god, is euer couetous & carefull. Lyke therfore as in this commaunde∣ment faythe is mayster & mouer of this lyberalytie / so is he chefe workeman in al ye other cōmaū∣dement{is}. In so moch yt without such fayth, lyberalytie profytes nothynge / but is rather a rasshe wastyng and expence of money. HEre also is worthye to be knowen yt this lyberalytie and goodnes muste be stretched and set forth euyn vnto our ene∣myes & aduersaryes. For what
lyberalyte is this, yf we be onely lyberal to our fryndes? as sayth Chryst. Luke ye .vi. chap. For an euyll mā vseth suche lyberalytie to his frynd{is} / & the dombe beest{is} do good & be lyberal to bestes of theyr owne kynde. Therfore a Chrysten man muste thynke an hygher thynge, yt his goodnes & lyberalytie may helpe them yt de¦serue it not / his enemyes & thē yt haue hurt hym after ye exāple of his heuēly father which suffreth the sonne to shyne vpon good & euyll / & the rayne to rayne vpon ye kynde and vnkynde. Here also thou shalt fynde how harde it is to do ye work{is} cōmaūded by god, & howe nature wryeth & wraste∣lyth her wt her selfe although she do easely & gladly her owne cho∣sen workes. So set before ye thy enemyes & thē yt be vnkynd to ye,
doynge them good / and so shalt thou fynde howe nyghe or howe farre thou arte from this cōmaū¦dement / & howe moche busynes thou shalt haue all thy lyfe tyme euyn in the worke of this one cō¦maundement. For excepte thou helpe thy enemye, whiche hathe nede vpon the, & socoure hym in his necessytie / it is euyn as thou haddest stollen frō hym, for thou arte bounde to helpe hym. So sayeth saynt Ambrose. Fede the hungrye (sayeth he) for yf thou fede hym not thou kyllest hym / as moch as is in the. In this cō∣maundement therfore depende the work{is} of mercy, which chryst wyll requyre of the in the extre∣me day. Yet neuerthelesse the ru∣lers of cytyes shulde take hede that vacaboundes & freres Ia∣cobyns and suche other / straūge
beggers were put away, & inhi∣byte, or at the lest they shulde be admytted by some meane, mea∣sure and ordre, leste by suche in∣ordynate lyuers vnder ye name of beggyng, errours and decey∣tes (of the which there be nowe many) shulde be suffered. I haue spoken more largely of the wor∣kes of this cōmaundement in ye sermonde that I made of vsury. ¶ The .viii cōmaūdement / thou shalt beare no false wytnes agaynst thy neyghbour. TRewely this com∣maūdement semeth but lytel / but ī very dede it is so great / that he yt wyll kepe it muste be in ieoperdye of his body and his lyfe, of his goodes
and fame of his fryndes and all that he hath. And yet it compre∣hendeth no more, but the worke of a lytell membre, the tonge / that is to saye. The truthe and gaynesay lyenge / yf nede requy∣re / and so here be forbyde many euyll workes of the tonge. Fyrst suche as be commytted by spea∣kynge, than after suche as be done by holdyng our peace. By spekynge whan he that hath an euyl cause in ye lawe / laboreth to proue and defende it by an euyll foundacyon, to take his neygh∣bour in a tryppe, to laye out all yt he can for to set out & promote his owne cause / & hydynge & ma¦kynge lesse what soeuer shulde helpe his neyghbours cause / in the which thyng he dothe not to his neyghboure, as he wolde be done to. There be some yt do this
for {pro}fyte & some partly to auoy∣de losse or sclaūdre / & bothe they seke more theyr owne {pro}fyte thā ye cōmaūdemētes of god / & they excuse thē selfes on this facyon. The lawe helpeth hym yt labou∣reth, as though they were not as well bounde to laboure in theyr neyghbours cause, as in theyr owne. So they wyllyngly suffre theyr neyghboures cause go to nought, all though they know yt it be ryght / ye which euyl is now a dayes so cōmon, yt I feare the∣re is no iudgement nor acte / but one {per}tie synneth agaynst this cō¦maundement. Yea & be it so that they be not able to brynge theyr purpose about / yet they haue an euyll mynde & wyll to do yll, by∣cause yt they wolde haue ye good cause of theyr neyghbour decaye & theyr owne euyl cause {pre}uayle.
And this synne is chefely cōmyt¦ted of the iudges / Iudges. whan the one part is a great man or ennemye to the iudges. For so they wyl be auenged of theyr enemye, & not haue ye dyspleasure of any great man. By this meanes are begon flateryng & adulacyon / and at ye leste suppressynge of the truthe / for here no man wyll suffre dys∣dayne, hurte & ieoperdye for the truthe sake / and so the cōmaun∣demēt of god must nedes be tro∣den vnder fete. And this is now for ye most parte the rule & ordre of the worlde. He that coueteth or wylleth to contynewe in this cōmaūdemēt may haue both his handes full of workes, & be but onely occupyed with his tonge. Moreouer oh good Iesu / howe many be there, that by gyftes & reward{is} be dryuen frō the truth
to holde theyr peace? so that sure¦lye in euery place, it is a hyghe great & rathe worke, a man not to be a false wytnes agaynst his neyghboure. BEsydes these there is yett a greatter wytnessyng of the truthe, wherby we be cōpelled to stry∣ue agaynst euyll spirytes / Euyll spiry∣tes be false teachers & prechers. but this stryfe begynneth not about temporall thynges / but for the gospell / & the truthe of the fayth which the deuyll can not suffre, but so goeth about all thynges / that the chefe of ye people (whom it is harde to withstande) may re¦syste & persecute the true faythe / of the whiche it is sayde the .81. psalme. Take awaye the poore man, and delyuer the nedy from
the hand{is} of a synner. And that this persecucyon is so seldome done and waxen out of vse / oure prelates of the spirytualtie be in the faute / whiche suffre not the gospell to be preched / but to be oppressyd / and so they haue ba∣nysshed (as moch as in them is) the cause for ye whiche such perse¦cucyon & wytnesse shulde be mo∣ued. And for the gospel they tea∣che vs theyr owne tradycyons & constytucyons, and what soeuer please them / & therfore Satan resteth. For whan the gospell is banysshed / fayth in Chryst must also be banysshed, & so all thyn∣ges come to passe after ye deuyls desyre / but & yf the gospell shuld be raysed vp agayne, and harde of the people / vndoubted all the worlde shulde be troubled, stur∣rynge the greatter parte of kyn∣ges,
prynces, bysshoppes, doc∣tours & spirytuall men to stryue agaynst it as it hath ben alway / so oft as the worde of god came forth to lyght. For ye worlde can not suffre yt thynge that cōmeth from god / the which thyng was proued by our sauyour Chryste, whiche was the greattest & beste beloued and chefe thynge yt god had / & yet he was more cruellye persecute, than al other thynges that came frō god / so farre was it of, that the worlde wolde re∣ceyue or take hym. And so as in his tyme there be fewe yt so fa∣uour the truth of god / that wyll put body & lyfe, ryches & fame / & all that they haue in ieoperdye for it. And that is the thyng that Chryst hathe promysed to them that folowe hym. Sayeng Ma∣thewe the .x. chapytre. You shall
be hated of all people for my na∣me. Also than many shalbe sclaū¦dred. But and yf housbādemen, shepardes, horsekepers, & suche fylthy men shulde persecute this truthe / who than myght not or wolde not graunt and wytnesse the truthe? but nowe whan the pope and bysshoppes, with pryn¦ces & kynges persecute it / euery man flyeth awaye, al men holde theyr peace, all flatter, lest they shulde lose theyr goodes, theyr honour, theyr fauour / and at the last theyr lyfe. ANd why do they this? truelye by∣cause they haue no faythe in god / nor thynke that they haue any good of god / for where soeuer is this faythe and
truste towarde god, there is a straūge hert bolde, and without feare / whiche graunteth & stan∣deth by ye truthe, whether he lose bodye or goodes / whether it be agaynst the bysshoppes or kyn∣ges / as we se that the holy mar∣tyrs haue done, for such an herte is content with the mercy & gen∣tylnesse of god / & dyspyseth ho∣noure, fauour, thankes, and ry∣ches of all worldly thyng{is} suffe∣ryng all thyng to go and come, that wyll not last & tary. As it is redde in the .14. psalme. He ab∣horreth suche sclaunderous and noughty {per}sones / & such as wor∣shyppe ye lorde, he setteth moche by. That is tyrantes and men of great power, whiche {per}secute the truthe and dyspyce god, those he feareth not, regardeth them not, he dispyseth them. And vpon the
other parte / they that suffre per∣secucyon for the truthe / and fea∣re god, more thā men. Those he foloweth, those he standeth by / those he defendeth, those he ho∣noureth / who soeuer be dysplea∣syd with them. As we rede in the 11. chapytre to the Hebrewes. That Moyses defended his bre¦therne ye chyldren of Israell / no∣thyng fearyng ye myghty kynge of Egypte. Lo agayne in this cō¦maūdement / thou seest shortelye howe that faythe is the mayster of this worke, for without fayth no man dare worke it / so be all workes grounded vpon faythe / as we haue ofte tymes sayd be∣fore. And so without faythe all workes be deade, thoughe they appere, seme and shyne neuer so goodlye / and be called neuer so good. For as no man dothe the
worke of this cōmaundement / but he ye is strōge, sure, & stedfast in ye fayth of the fauour of god / so can not he do any worke of ye cōmaundementes without this fayth. So yt of this cōmaūdemēt euery man may take a felynge & perseueraunce, whether he be a chrysten mā or no / & may knowe whether he doth good work{is} or no. Nowe we se yt almighty god hath not onely set before vs, our lorde Iesu Chryst / in whome we shulde beleue wt suche truste / but also yt we shulde haue hym for an exāple of suche trust, settynge before vs suche good workes in hym / yt we shuld byleue in hym, folowe hym, & abyde euermore in hym. As he sayth in ye .17. cha. of Iohn̄. I am the way,Chryste is ye way, truth, and lyfe. ye truthe & the lyfe / he is ye way, by ye whi∣che we shulde folowe hym / the
truth yt we may byleue in hym, ye lyfe yt we maye euermore lyue in hym, vpō these thyng{is} before re∣hersyd / it is manyfest yt all other workes not cōmaūded, be very {per}ylous & easy to be knowen / as by buyldynge of churches, dec∣kyng of thē, pylgrimage to sayn¦tes / & what soeuer is wrytten in the popes decrees, which discey∣ueth ye world, greueth & dystroy∣eth it / & maketh mans cōscyence vnquyete, & hath brought fayth to sylence & made it weake / ther∣fore in asmoche as a man hathe busynes ynoughe to do in ye com¦maūdement of god, all other set a parte / so yt he can neuer do al ye good work{is} cōmaūded to hym of god / why thā doth he seke other which be nother necessary to him nother cōmaūded these work{is} ne¦cessary & cōmaūded left vndone.
THe two last cōmaūde∣mentes forbyddynge euyll desyres or lust{is} of the body / and plea∣sures & loue of temporall thyn∣ges be clere in them selfe, & with¦out hurt to our neyghbour. And these lustes last to the graue / for the stryfe agaynste them conty∣nueth vs vnto dethe. Therfore saynt Paule wrytynge to ye Ro∣mayns the .7. chapytre compre∣hendeth these two cōmaūdemen¦tes in one / & they be set for one purpose, whiche we can not ob∣tayne / but onely we labour and stryue to come to it vnto the ho∣noure of deth. For there was ne∣uer man so holy, which hath not felte euyll lustes in hym / specy∣ally yf he had any cause or occa∣syon / for orygynall synne is na∣turally borne with vs, sufferyng
it self to be oppressyd / but not to be vtterly plucked awaye but by deth / which deth for the endyng of this orygynall synne, is bothe profytable and to be wysshed for / and that we may man∣fully fyght agaynst this orygynall synne. I beseche god to helpe vs. Amen. ¶Finis.
