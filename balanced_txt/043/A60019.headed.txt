THE PREFACE TO THE READER. READER, IN this small Book you have an Impartial Account of the most considerable Acti∣ons or Passages relating to the War, &c. between the Confederate Princes, Turks and Hungarian Rebels, in divers parts of Europe, the Two precedent Cam∣paigns, as Sieges, Battels, Skirmishes, and Negotiations: but more particularly of the famous Sieges of Buda and Newheusel, the Defeat of the Turkish Army near Gran, the continued currant of the Venetian Victo∣ries, and glorious Success of the King of
Poland, the Surprize of Count Teckeley, and the Ruin of the Rebels Interest in the Up∣per Hungary; Shewing the prevalence of the Christian Arms against those Infidels, and such as were their Partakers: who for many years have deluged the once flourishing part of Europe with Blood, and committed such out∣rages as have startled Mankind. But the tri∣umph of the wicked is but for a season; which at length they have found; and that they may yet be made more sensible, that he whose bles∣sed Name they impiously blaspheme, will crush them' with a Rod of Iron, is the Wish of, Reader, Yours to serve you, JOHN SHIRLEY.
A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE Heroick Actions and Enterprises OF THE CONFEDERATE PRINCES Against the TURKS and Hungarian REBELS, &c. THE Turks, Anno 1683. routed at Barkan, that place taken, and soon after Gran, the Campaign drew to a Conclusion by reason of the Season's Advancement, and the Soldiers were disposed for their Winter-Quarters. The King of Poland, and other confede∣rate Princes retiring with the greatest part of their Troops to their respective Countries, to be the better in a readiness to take field early in the Spring; of which Teckely taking the Advan∣tage, fell in with the King of Poland's Rear, killing 300. and taking some part of the Baggage; but being charged by the Lithuanian Troops, he was not only obliged to retreat with the loss of a considerable number of his men, but to fly to the utmost Corner of the upper Hungary, which gave the Imperialists opportunity to recover some Towns, and repair such as were ruinous, as likewise to block up Newheusel.
The Turks being thus put to the worst, and in danger of losing Footing in Hungary, the bad Conduct, as they alledged, that had run things into so great a Hazard, was imputed to Cera Mustapha, the Grand Vizier, whose Head, to appease the unruly multitude in Con∣stantinople, the Grand Signior was obliged to send for by an Aga, who on the fifteenth day of December strangled, or caused him to be stran∣gled in his Tent. Anno 1684. Early the ensuing Spring, the Imperial Army taking the Field, pressed Newheusel with much Resolution; but the Duke of Lorain perceiving it a Work of great Difficulty, it was ra∣ther at that time concluded to reduce it by Famine; and thereupon blocking it up, his Highness drew off the greatest part of the Army to take in Vaccia and Novegrade, but found, upon his Arrival, that the Turks, to the number of twenty thousand, had strongly possest the Hills near Vaccia, under the leading of the Vizier of Buda, towards whom he marched in two Lines, about Eleven in the Morning, who kept their station till he approached to the foot of the Hill, and then with their usual Cries, descending, they charged the Regiment of Taff in the middle of the first Line, but the Duke being there in per∣son, they were beaten off. His Highness having his Horse wounded, and two Officers killed with Pistol-shot very near him; yet the Turks rallyed a second and third time, but observing the firmness of the Christians, they fell into Confusion, and in the end to open Flight; but being hotly pursued, 3000 were slain 1500 taken Prisoners, with seven pieces of Cannon, eighteen Ensigns, the Vizier's Horse, him∣self, with two other Bassa's, being killed; and amongst the Priso∣ners were found a Bassa and ten Aga's: or Zangiacks; the Imperialists in this Action not losing above 100 men; and amongst them none of Note. Whereupon Vaccia, Novegrade and soon, after Pest, fell into the Hands of the Imperialists; so that whilst Terror and Confusion reigned amongst the Infidels, the Duke of Lorrain calling a Council of of War, it was resolved, Buda the Turks chief Fortress in Hungary, should be besieged. The Resolves of the Council of War being put in Practice, and the Turks who had set fire on the lower Town, beaten into the up∣per Town, the Christians possessed themselves of divers strong Posts, and plaied from their Battery incessantly, the better to give the Mi∣ners opportunity to run their Mines to the foot of the Bulwarks, and soon after sent a Trumpet to summon the Bassa-Governour to sur∣render; whose Answer was, That he had Powder and Bullet to defend
it; and would do it to the last extremity; knowing if he did otherwise, he should be delivered into the hands of the Hangman, and ruin his Friends and Favourites. Whilst these things were doing, Count Teckeley took the Castle of Ʋngwar, and put most of the Gentry he found therein to the Sword. But the Imperial Troops making head against him, he was forced to fly to the strong Castle of Mongatz: And General Lesly, after a fu∣rious Battery, and the overthrow of two Turkish Parties, that were coming to relieve it, had Virevitzi put into his possession, the Garrison consisting of Six Hundred Janizaries, having leave to March out with Bag and Baggage, the place having been in the possession of the Turks One Hundred and Thirteen Years. The Poles and Venetians being likewise abroad, defeated divers Parties of the Turks and Tartars, re∣covering many great Booties and Places of strength; the latter taken after many furious Assaults. The City of Prevesa, aad the Morla∣ques, a People who have put themselves under the protection of the Venetians made many Incursions into Valachia and Moldavia; greatly endamaging the Turkish Territories on that side. The Duke of Bavaria being by this time at the Head of his Troops before Buda, the Siege was carried on with great Courage and Reso∣lution; which obliged the besieged on the 17th of August, to make a Sally with their utmost strength: whereby the Christians that were in the Advance-works, were forced to give ground; but seconded by the next Guard, they soon returned upon the Enemy, and drove them with great slaughter into the Town, sprung a Mine at the Root of their Attack-Bastion, but it effected not the Execution intended: yet they lodged in the breach, forcing the Enemy thence: but for want of a considerable Number of Foot, durst not attempt forcing their passage into the City. And now Cera Mahomet, the Governour, dying of his Wounds, it was expected the Place which was greatly ruined with the Cannon and Bombs, would have surrendered: But upon Ibraim Bassa's taking upon him the Government; and upon the approach of the Serasquier Bassa, with the Rallied Troops, the Garrison was encouraged to hold out, though the Curtain between the Town and Castle, was rent in pieces, and the Houses so miserably burnt and shattered with the Bombs, that they, to prevent it for the fu∣ture, took off the first stories of the Houses, and covered the rest thick with Earth, laying straw in the streets, to prevent, as much as might be, the pieces of the Grannado-shells from doing Execution in their bursting.
General Scultz understanding what posture Count Teckeley's Ar∣my was in, resolved to surprize him in his Camp, and marched with such secrecy, that he came within Culverin-shot before he was disco∣vered, and fell upon the Rebels with such fury, that all they could do, after some small resistance, was to save themselves by flight, lea∣ving their Tents, Ammunition, and Baggage, tegether with the Coach, Standard, and private Letters of Teckley, who was forced to fly almost naked; and the German Cavalry hotly pursuing them, ma∣ny were drowned in the River Tarza: so that Three Thousand were reckoned to fall by the Sword, and smothered in the water: and a∣mongst them divers Hungarian Lords; the rest, for the most part, es∣caping into Esperies. Buda being closely pressed by the Christians, the Serasquier used many Endeavours to relieve it by alarming the Besiegers, often at∣tempting with his Light Horsemen, to break through the Leaguer; but was as often prevented, and beat back with much slaughter: But the season advancing, and the continual Rains hindering the Miners, as likewise a Mortal sickness raging in the Camp, after all that could in such Exigencies be done, on the 29th of October, a Council of War was held, in which it was resolved, That the Emperor's Or∣ders sent a little before, for raising the Siege, should be obeyed. Whereupon all the sick and wounded men, being near Eight Thou∣sand, together with the Baggage and useless persons, were sent down the River, the Cannon taken from the Batteries, to secure the Retreat of the Troops, in their Retreat in the Isle of St. Andrea, where the whole Army consisting of Thirty Thousand men, passed the Danube the first of November, over a Bridg of Boats, the Cavalry fa∣cing the Serasquier, whilst the Foot Marched off; the Conduct of which was in such good order, that neither the besieged, nor the Serasquier's Army, durst attack them. The Imperialist drawn off, the Serasquier entered Buda, and caused the works the Besiegers had rai∣sed, to be demolished; as likewise the Ruins of that place to be re∣paired, the City, in a manner, being reduced to Ashes and Rubbish, and must of necessity have fallen into the hands of the Christians, had not the extremity of the weather contributed more to its defence than the Valour of the Besieged, whose number was greatly decreased, and provision spent. And now the Christians not thinking it worth while to keep Pest and Vaccia, slighted them; and having well secured all places of im∣portance, leaving Newbeusel blocked up, the Troops went into their
Quarters appointed in Hungary, Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia. And so ended this Campaign and Siege, in the latter of which, by sickness and the Sword, not less than Fifteen Thousand Christians fell, nor was the loss of the Infidels less considerable. The Imperialists having all this time blocked up Newheusel, and frustrated the several attempts made to relieve it with Men, Provisi∣on and Ammunition, it was resolved, That the Christian Army early in the Spring, should take the Field, as well to prevent the Turks, who were roving abroad in Parties, from gaining any advantage, as to draw towards that place, in order to an early Siege; of which the Serasquier Bassa having notice, resolved to make another attempt for its relief: yet the Undertaking was not carried on with such secre∣cy, but that Colonel Heusler marching with a Party of Horse and Dra∣goons, fell upon the Convoy, killed divers, and put the rest to flight, taking Sixty Waggons laden with Provision and Ammunition: Yet some of the flyers got into the Town by an unsuspected way; which so encouraged the Bassa-Governour, that he sent out a Party to for∣rage the Countrey: And that Party falling upon Cutra, a small Vil∣lage, put the Inhabitants to the Sword, leaving it in flames. Anno 1685. For the Accommodation of the Army that was drawing out from divers quarters, the better to enable it to carry on the Siege, when begun, the Emperor of Germany sent express Or∣ders to the Cities of Ratisbone, Passaw, Ʋlme, and other places upon the Danube, to provide store of Provision, and Ammunition, with Boats, for transporting the Troops, as occasion required, all the Of∣ficers being ordered to make their Recruits by the middle of April at farthest, the Estates of Austria raising Nine Thousand men for the Service, at their proper charge. Nor were the Turks remiss, but made great preparations throughout the Ottoman Empire, it being then reported, That their Emperor would make War in his proper Person. For although the Christians failed in their attempt upon Buda, yet a fear continued, that they might enterprize it a second time; and the rather, because that Garrison was by this time much weakned, through a mortal Disease that raged there; of which Seitan, the Commanding Bassa, and many of the prime Officers died. Whilst these things were transacting, a Party of Four Thousand Turks, made an Invasion into Croatia, doing considerable mischief to the Inhabitants: But being encountred by some Imperial Troops, and the Inhabitants, who took up Arms to oppose them, they
were defeated with the Loss of One Thousand men, the rest esca∣ping to Canisa; to which Garrison they appertained. And to re∣quite the Injury Croatia had sustained, the Garrisons of Virovitza, and Salawar, made Incursions into the Turkish Terriies, taking great Booty. And now Colonel Heusler having notice, that another Convoy of Eight Thousand Turks and Tartars, was marching toward Novigrade, to put One Hundred Waggons of Provision into Newhen∣sel, he resolved to oppose them, though he had with him but Two Thousand men; and accordingly marching toward the Enemy, he attacked them in their Vanguard, killing between Three and Four Hundred upon the place, and taking a great many Prisoners. But whilst the Dispute lasted, those that had charge of the Waggons, re∣tired with them in great confusion towards Novigrad, whom the Colonel thought not fit to pursue with so small a strength, for fear of being entrapped by an Ambuscade: Yet divers of the Waggons over∣throwing in the rough ways, were afterward taken by the Imperia∣lists, and burnt. Nor were the Poles and Venetians less active on their part, to endamage the Infidels; the latter with a strong power besieging Singn; but finding that place well Garrisoned, and forti∣fied, after the loss of some men, they drew off: Yet the Mor∣laques, under the protection of that Signory, falling upon the Turkish Troops that were advancing to its Relief, cut Three or Four Hundred of them in pieces, put the rest to flight, and took great spoil. Caminiec, by reason of the Debates in the Diet of Poland, in the beginning of May, 1685. not being closely blocked up, the Garri∣son consisting of Turks and Tartars, found means to roam a∣broad, and ravage the Countrey, storing themselves with what Provisions came to hand, and leading many of the poor people into miserable Captivity. They likewise sacked Radzenoaw, and several appendant Villages; which Success encouraged them to make another Incursion toward Barre and Melelsos; but not with the like advantage: For the Cossacks quartering in those parts, taking the Allarum, fell upon them with such fury, that they cut most of them in pieces, rescuing the Prisoners they had ta∣ken, and recovering all the Booty; which known to the Gover∣nour, he, least provision should grow scarce, put all the Jews, and such as had made no provision of Victuals for themselves out of the Garrison.
On the 15th. of May the great Guns and Mortars of new Invention which the Emperor had caused to be made, arrived at Vienna, and the Troops, as well of the Circles, as of the Hereditary Countries, drew together; all Care being taken to furnish and hasten them out, the ready Obedience and Chearfulness of the Commanders and Soldiers every where presaging a successful Campaign. And now Colonel Heusler being strengthned with additional Troops, posted himself near Barkan to observe the motion of the Enemy, and prevent them from putting a Supply into Newheusel, which they diligently laboured to effect; that Garrison being then brought to such Necessity, that Horse∣flesh was accounted a Dainty amongst the meaner Soldiers; and the better to spare Provision, 130 persons were thrust out; amongst whom were divers Christian Prisoners: And the Grand Signior, for the better Accommodation of his Army, sent an Express to Abafti, Prince of Transilvania, not only to have his Troops in readiness to march upon the first Orders, but to provide one hundred thousand measures of Corn, and Waggons to convey it to such places as should be directed. And whilst the Dyet of Poland were coming to a Result for the Management of the War, a considerable Party of Turks and Tartars fell upon divers Villages in the Ʋkraine, burnt them to the Ground, and brought away a considerable Booty, with many Prisoners, which did not a little trouble that King; insomuch, that he instantly commanded the Troops that were in a readiness to march to the Frontiers, himself resolving, with the whole power of the Kingdom, to follow and revenge the Injury he sustained by the Infi∣dels; but e're he advanced, News was brought him, That the Hospodar Duca, Prince of Moldavia, taken Prisoner the preceding Summer, by the Cossacks, died at Leopol before the hundred thousand Crowns which he had offered for his Ransom, could be returned. The Venetians in League with the Christian Empire, and the other Confederate Princes having about the latter end of May joyned their Fleet with the Gallies and Men of War of the great Duke of Tuscany, it sailed into the Mediterranean, under the command of Captain Ge∣neral Morosini, and there the Soldiers made divers Descents, taking and garrisoning several places of strength, whilst the Land-forces in Dal∣matia had the like Success, which did not a little alarm the Grand Signior on that side: That Republick on their part vigorously pro∣secuting the War by Sea and Land, and not only alarmed him, but obliged him to draw off a part of those Troops he designed for the War of Hungary, to defend his own Territories. The Inhabitants on
the Sea-coast being mostly inclinable to put themselves under the Protection of the Christians, or to leave the senceless Places desolate, by retiring further into the Country, as not caring to expose them∣selves and their Substance to the Miseries of War, which, like a Tem∣pest, they perceived hanging over their Heads. This Success of the Christian Confederates in so many places, obliged the Cities of Espi∣res and Caschaw, to send their Deputies to Newstadt, where the Im∣perial Court resided, to beg the Emperors Pardon to declare their Willingness to receive Imperial Garrisons, and renew their Oaths of Fidelity; nor was Count Teckely behind them in shew of Willing∣ness to come to an Accord with the Emperor, and tender his Sub∣mission; but his former Artifices on the like urgent occasion, caused his Proposals to be rejected; it being concluded, that what he of∣fered in that case, was only to protract time till the Turkish Army could take the Field: so that no Preparations were delayed on the part of the Imperialists, but all things hastened for the Siege of Newheusel. In order to which, Boats laden with Provision and Ammunition were sent from Vienna and other Places, in great number. The Troops of Suabia and other Circles arrived daily; Money was given out to raise new Forces, and every thing carried on to the best Advantage; and the better to try how Count Teckely stood affected, General Schultz received Orders to besiege the strong Castle of Ʋngwar, the principal Fortress in the upper Hungary which, in hopes of being relieved by Teckely, made a resolute Defence; he having sent the Go∣vernour private Notice that he was drawing his Troops together for that Purpose; which altogether confirmed the Emperor in his opinion of that Rebel's feigned Pretences; but being narrowly observed by the Imperial Troops in those Parts, the Marquess Doria, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Caraffa, fell upon an advance Party of the Rebels, and put them to the Rout, taking the Commander in chief, one of Teckely's chief Favorites. The Turkish Troops in considerable number, having by this time taken the Field, made divers Incursions into Lithuania and Podolia, but met with bad Success; for the Power of those Provinces being in Arms, they were, for the most part, defeated; and the Booty they had taken, recovered; one Party more especially which advanced with∣in twelve Miles of Leopol, was cut off by the Sieur Lizinzki, who taking the Allarm, and getting a Body of Horse together, fell up∣on them with such Fury, that those who escaped the Sword, for the most part, perished in the Rivers, in attempting to repass them in
places not fordable. And now there being some misunderstanding between the King of Poland and the Czars of Moscovy, which might have occasioned a Rupture, the former, with the advice of the Se∣nate, resolved to send an Envoy to the latter, to accommodate mat∣ters in an amicable manner, that by reason of any division between them, the Turks and Tartars might have no advantage; which in the end concluded successfully, to the satisfaction, advantage, and con∣tent of both Nations. And the better to render the King of Po∣land's Army more formidable, the Diet consented to raise the Rear∣ban, laying great Penalties upon such Gentlemen as should be re∣miss in appearing in Arms upon the first Summons. The Chevalierd' Lanco being abroad with divers Troops (on the part of the Venetians) under his Command, met on the 29th of May, 1685. a Party of Turkish Horse and Foot Marching towards Hungary, which he charged with such fury, that he kill'd, and took most of them Prisoners, few escaping to tell the News; which cau∣sed the Mainetes more vigorously to prosecute the War they under∣took on the behalf of the Confederates against the Turks, who ha∣ving such large Territories to defend, were forced to divide their Troops into so many divisions, as rendered them the less able to carry on their designs in Hungary: Insomuch, that divers, as well Christians as others, who made their escape from Buda to Gran, re∣ported, That that Garrison was in great want of all Necessaries: and that if it was again attacked, the Turks would not be able to defend it as formerly; but Newheusel being the main Enterprize designed this Campaign, no heed was given to their Asseverations: yet so sensible was the Serasquier Bassa of its weakness, that he sent a part of the Provision thither, which was brought out of the Turkish Ter∣ritories, for the supply of the Army that was to act under his Com∣mand, which gave encouragement to the Garrison, and such as were appointed thereto to go on with their Fortifications ruined the last Summer. And now the Seige of Newheusel being resolved, Cardi∣nal Bonviso, the Pope's Nuncio, at the Imperial Court, gave One Hun∣dred Thousand Florins toward the Expences of the Blockade, pro∣mising a greater sum for the Encouragement of the Officers and Sol∣diers when it should be taken. Whereupon on the Eleventh of June, the Duke of Lorrain took his leave of the Court, and deprted for Hungary, with full power to act with the Imperial Forces this Cam∣paign, as he shall judg most advantageous for the Service of the Em∣peror.
General Schultz, notwithstanding his having taken the Base-Town, or Out-Fortress of Ʋngwar, and defeated a Party sent out by Count Teckeley to succour it: Yet the Upper Town being strongly fortified, stored with Provision and Ammunition, after some Loss before it, he thought fit to draw off, and wait a more favourable opportunity to attack it. Whilst these things were transacting, Ten Thousand Turks found means to pass the Bridg of Esseck, and joyn that Body of an Ar∣my they had formed near Belgrade, there giving out, that they would relieve Newheusel, whatever it cost them. And the better to enable them to make an attempt for its relief, the Bassa of Bossina re∣ceived Orders from the Port to march with the Troops of that Coun∣try towards Hungary. On the 13th of June the Duke of Lorrain, with a great Train of Officers and Nobility, arrived at the Imperial Camp, near Newheusel, where he found things in a great forwardness; and the same day held a Council of War: after which Count Caprara, with Four Thou∣sand Horse, was sent out to learn the posture of the Enemy: And in the mean while the Troops of Bavaria, Cologne, Lunenburg, Franco∣nia, Suabia, and the Ʋpper Rhine, were expected to make up the Ar∣my Fifty Thousand Fighting men, besides other Troops raised by the Confederate Princes, which were upon their March, and such as were posted in divers places, to preserve the Provinces from the In∣cursion of the Enemy. And although General Schultz at present failed to reduce Ʋngwar, by reason his Correspondence with some of the Garrison was discovered; yet he had the good fortune to take the Town of Onoth, a place possessed by the Rebels, with the loss of Twenty Two Men only on his part; where he found a great Booty, consisting of 300 Horses, and 1000 Head of Cattle, killing 130 of the Enemy. General Caprara, who was sent out to observe the motion of the Enemy, defeated a Party of Turks that were on their March to Novi∣grad, making his Report, That the Turks near Buda were Forty Thou∣sand strong; which he learned from such Prisoners as he had taken in the Action. Whereupon the Vice-Roy of Croatia received an Ex∣press to draw his Troops into the Field, the better to be in a readi∣ness to prevent any Incursion that might be made into that Province. The Palatine of Hungary, the Count D'Esterhasi, made likewise what speed he could to raise the Eight Thousand Hungarians he proposed to bring into the Emperor's Service, to act conjunctly with the Army, or
separately, as his Imperial Majesty should think most convenient for his advantage; the Principal Officers of the Imperial Army being in their order these: The Duke of Lorrain, General; Prince Waldeck, Commander of the Foot, as Mareschal De Camp, General; and under him the Duke De Croy, General of the Artilery; the Prince of Newburg, Great Ma∣ster of the Teutonick Order; the Count De Souches, and Count de Scherf∣fenburg, the two latter in quality of Major-Generals; the Count De Caprara, Commander of the Horse, as Mareschal De Camp General; under him Prince Louis of Baden, and the Count De Dunewaldet, as Generals of Horse; the Count De Palfie, Lieutenant General; Count Taff, the Baron de Mercy, the Count de Lodron, and the Count De Sti∣rum, Major Generals; the Prince de Solms, Commander of the Ca∣valry in Croatia, and the Marquess de Lavergne, of the Infantry under General Leslie. The Forces against the Rebels in the Ʋpper Hungary, are commanded by General Schultz; and the Count Esterhasi to com∣mand those Hungarians he raises for the Service. As for the Serasquier Bassa, though he was not ignorant that the Christians intended to open the Campaign with the Siege of Newheu∣sel, the place which he had an Express from the Grand Signior to re∣lieve at the hazard of all his Forces; yet he stayed near Belgrade, to expect the Asian Troops, which were on their March; whose neglect in advancing, brought such a fear upon Novigrad, that although it had been re-inforced with three Hundred Janizaries, yet upon the approach of Count Caprara, with Three Thousand Horse, the Garri∣son left the Town, and betook them to the Castle, as imagining him to be the Vant-guard of the Christian Army; and the rather, for that it was some time given out, That that place would be first be∣sieged. A Party of Hussars, in the service of the Emperor, being abroad, fell upon Two Hundred Janizaries near Buda, put them to the rout, killed most of them, and took the Aga that commanded them, Pri∣soner; about whom Letters were found from the Vizier of Buda to the Bassa of Newheusel, wherein he exhorted him, in case he was at∣tacked, to defend the place to the last Extremity, and not despair of being relieved. General Schultz pursuing his success in the Ʋpper Hungary, made himself Master of the Fortress of Casnahauka, and most of the Hungarians of that place, upon their supplication, were taken into the Emperor's service.
A Party of Eight Thousand Turks having about the beginning of June besieged the Fortress of Duare in Dalmatia, scituate between Spalatro and Cataro, the Proveditor, General Valier, and Signior Mi∣chieli, Commissary-General of the Hors, drew together the Forces of the Signory under their Command, and attacked the Infidels in three places, with such vigor and success, that they forced them to raise the Siege, and retire in great disorder, leaving behind them Three pieces of Cannon, Three Mortars, a Petard, Fourteen Co∣lours, and the greatest part of their Baggage, together with a Con∣voy of Provision, newly arrived in their Camp. Three Hundred were killed upon the place, Eighty taken Prisoners, and the Marlaques sent out in the pursuit of the flers, who put them mostly to the Sword. Of the Venetians only Ten were killed, and Thirty wounded. The Bassa of Bossina, who by this time had his Orders for marching into Hungary, was countermanded, being upon the Borders with Four Thou∣sand Horse; and understanding the Leaguers were attacked, advan∣ced to their relief with all diligence: but coming too late, was him∣self charged by the Venetians, and put to the rout. Whereupon many of the neighbouring Inhabitants casting off the Turkish Yoak, put themselves under the protection of the Christiands; and upon their humble supplication, had Quarters assigned them by the Provedi∣tor Valier; which obliged the Grand Signior to hasten his Troops out of Asia, compelling the Merchants Ships at Smirna, and other Ports, to transport them. And by reason some of the Bassa's upon their arrival at Adrianople, had not compleated their Levies, he caused them to be strangled. On the 23d of June, the Duke of Lorrain, with a detachment of 700 Horse, and two Companies of Hussars, marched towards Gran, to observe by what way the place might be best relieved, in case the Turks should, to divert the Imperial Forces, besiege it. And the 25th of June his Highness passed the River Gran over a Bridg of Boats, with Three Thousand Horse, Two Hundred Dragoons, and a party of Hussars, to observe the scituation of Novigrad. The next day he came before the place, at what time the Bassa Governour sent out Three Hundred Horse in Two Squadrons, who skirmished with the Hussars, and a detachment of Foot, to secure the Retreat of the Horse; which obliged the Duke of Lorrain to send a detach∣ment to possess the Hills, from whence the place might be the better observed; and went thither in person, when the Troops command∣ed by the Princes De Conti and De-la-Roche Sur-Yon, advanced to the
Foot of the Rampart, notwithstanding the continual Fire of the Turkish Infantry, which were posted there. The Duke of Lorrain ha∣ving taken a view of the place, commanded the Troops that kept the Hills, to retire; who in their Retreat had a brisk skirmish with the Enemy's Horse: But the Princes De Conti and De la Roche Sur-yon, advancing to their assistance, the Turks retired in much disorder. In this action the Chevalier de' Poncherron, received a shot in the Breast; and several others were wounded. On the 4th of July his Highness returned to the Army before Newheusel, and gave such encourage∣ment to the Pioniers, that they carried on the Works with much bra∣very, notwithstanding the Fire of the Enemy: so that by the 8th of July the Lines were finished: And on the 10th, as the Christians were raising a Battery, the Turks made a Sally, to hinder their work; but were soon obliged to retire in great disorder: Yet in the Acti∣on the Prince De Commercy, Prince Ferdinand de Wirtemberg, and some other persons of Quality, who were Voluntiers, were wound∣ed. On the 11th at night the Trenches were opened, and the Baron de Beck posted himself within Pistol-shot of the Covert-way, and maintained himself there notwithstanding the continual Fire of the bsieged. And about Nine of the Clock in the Evening Three Thousand Foot opened the Trenches on the other side the River, within Eighty paces of the Ditch. On the 12th, the Trench was carried from the right to the left; and the Imperialists began to raise Two Batteries, to ruin the Defences of the place. The 13th at night they finished the work, and made a Re-doubt at the Head of each Trench, to defend themselves against the Enemies Sallies. The 14th at night they began a false attack on the side opposite to the true one, and made a parallel which joyned the Heads of the Two Trenches. On the 15th at night, they carried on the Two Attacks to the Edg of the Ditch, and finished a Battery of Eighteen pie∣ces of Cannon, in the middle of the Parallel. On the 16th, in o∣pen day, a Christian Slave, though with Chains on his Legs, en∣deavoured to escape out of the Town; but Three Turks pursued him, and cut off his Head: Yet ere they could retire, Two of them were killed by the Shot of the Imperialists. On the 16th at ight, the besieged made a continual fire, and shot a great many Arows and Stones; by which means Fifteen Christians were killed, and Thirty wounded. On the 17th the Enemy abandoned a Phlanque whch covered one of the Gates of the place on the left of the At∣tack; and at the same time set fire on that side to the Pasedes;
upon which there were Three or Four Hundred Heads of Christians. As for this place, it is scituate upon a Plain full of Moors, but in most places passable, having Six Bastions lined with Stone-work, a Ditch full of water, between Seven and Eight Foot deep, and Eigh∣teen Foot broad: But for Out-works, it has only Two Half Moons before the Two Gates, and the River Neutra: And in the Town, up∣on the arrival of the Imperial Army, were supposed between 1000 and 1200 fighting men. Whilst the Siege of Newheusel went on thus successfully, the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria arrived with a splendid Train at Vienna; where at his landing he was received by the Emperor, and the Cannon of the City fired in token of his welcom; the Garrison-Soldiers and Burghers being likewise in Arms. Whereupon his Imperial Majesty and Electoral Highness went to the Augustins-Church; whi∣ther the young Arch-Dutchess was soon ofter brought by the Empress, and the Empress Dowager, and there Married to his Electoral Highness of Bavaria, by the Bishop of Colonitz: which done, the Cannon round the City was again discharged, and their Highnesses were conducted to the Pallace, where they supped publickly with their Imperial Majesties (the Ambassadors of Spain and Venice sitting at the same Table). During Supper the Cannon was discharged a third time, and the Pallace, and almost all the Houses in the City were illuminated with Flambeaux and Torches, accompanied with all other Expressions of Joy: In which we will leave them, and return to the Camp before Newheusel, where his Electoral High∣ness soon after arrived. On the 18th and 19th of July nothing considerable passed: but on the 20th, the Imperialists battered the Wall with Nine pieces of Cannon, and cast Bombs and Carcases into the Town, which greatly endamaged, and annoyed the besieged. The night following they lodged themselves on the right and left, in the Ditch: And though it was a very dangerous work, yet only a Captain of the Regi∣ment of Metternich, and an other of the Troops of Brunswick, were killed, and Three or Four Soldiers wounded. The same night they finished the Lines of Communication along the Ditch, from one Battery to the other; and the Imperial Dragoons, together with those of Brunswick, making about Five Thousand Men, were sent under the Command of the Count of Stirum, towards Commora, to cover the Two Bridges the Duke of Lorrain had caus'd to be laid over the Danube. The 21st the Besiegers fired on the Town with great
Fury; continuing to do so all that night, from a Battery of Nine∣teen pieces of Cannon, and from Two of Twelve pieces; as like∣wise from Fourteen Mortar-pieces, which set fire to divers Hou∣ses: but the diligence of the Inhabitants was so great, that they presently extinguished the flame. That night they raised Two new Batteries of Six Pieces of Cannon, each very near the Ditch; and a Thousand men were commanded to work near the Gran-Gate, in order to let the water into the River Neutra, which is Five Foot lower than the Ditch. The same work was also begun on the o∣ther side the Town; yet in the carrying it on only Four men were killed, and Four and Twenty wounded. The 22d the Besiegers renewed the fire of their Mortars and Cannon; which continued with such success, that the Town seemed all on a flame for the space of Four and Twenty Hours. On the same day, and on the 23d the Turks brought a great many Christian Slaves in Chains, to repair the Ramparts the Cannon had ruined; as likewise to ex∣cite the Compassion of the Imperialists, that they might forbear fi∣ring. Whereupon the Duke of Lorrain wrote a Letter to the Bassa Governour, letting him understand, That if he did misuse those Slaves, he would not give any Quarter to the Garrison, in case the place was taken: to which no answer was returned. The 23d at night a Trench was cut into the Ditch, for the passage of Two co∣vered Boats, to make with Planks and Rafters a Lodgment for the Miners at the foot of the Bastion; but one of those Boats presently sunk, the other meeting with little better success, the Lieutenant of the Miners being wounded, the besiegers were forced to quit that Enterprize. And the Prince De Conti coming out of the Trenches, was lightly wounded with a Musquet-Bullet in the Head. The 24th the besieged made a Sally, and surprised some of the Troops of Suabia in a Redoubt they had made before the Tower of Vienna, of whom Three Hundred, with a Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain, were killed. On the 25th the Christians finished Two Batteries on the Ditch, and began to fill it; and the same day had an Hundred men killed and wounded, the Sieur Ross, Colonel of the Bava∣rian Troops, being of the number of the first. The same day a Barrel of Powder took fire, by which Five and Twenty men were killed and wounded; and Collonel Heusler and Colonel Zabor, who were sent out to observe the Enemy, came back, having cut off a Party. of about Thirty Turks, near Gran, and taken several Prison∣ers, giving the Duke of Lorrain an account, That the Ottoman At¦my,
commanded by the Serasquier Bassa, was marching towards Gran; and that there were Twelve Hundred Tartars near Novigrad, in a readiness to joyn them. And at the same instant Prince Waldeck ar∣rived at the Camp. On the 25th of July the besieged began to fill the Ditch; the Duke of Lorrain, the Prince Waldeck, and the other General Officers being the greatest part of the night in the Trenches, which they continued to do the night following. On the 27th the be∣sieged sallied, and ruined part of the Besiegers work, made for let∣ting the water out of the Ditch. The rest of the night, and the day following, the Bavarians were imployed in raising a Re-doubt at the Head of their work, to cover it against the Enemies Sally. The 28th the Besiegers carried their Gallery very near to the Walls of the Town; but the bsieged, with their Granado's, and other Ar∣tificial Fireworks, burnt a part of it, which was repaired on the 29th. On the 30th the besieged made another Sally, supposing to ruin the Gallery, to which they had set fire; insomuch that the flame seized on one of the Batteries: whereupon the Christians that were in the Trenches, retired in some disorder. But the Duke of Lorrain hastning thither, with his drawn Sword, and threatning to kill those that were running away, he himself carri∣ed back the Officers to the Posts they had quitted; and directing and encouraging the Soldiers, the fire was put out. On this occa∣sion his Highness was a long time exposed to the Fire of the E∣nemy, and Nine or Ten persons killed very near him. The 30th and 31st the Besiegers repaired the Gallery, and carried it to the Wall of the Town, in despite of the Enemies firing from their Works; and with their Cannon so ruined the Attack-Bastion, that the Ene∣my could no longer make use of the Cannon they had there: and the breaches were likewise very much enlarged in the Curtain. On the First of August the besieged made a Sally with Four Hundred men; but were repulsed at the cost of Forty Christians Lives; the Ge∣neral Souches in that Action being wounded in the Neck with an Ar∣row. Whilst the Siege of Newheusel was vigorously carried on, News came to the Duke of Lorrain, That on the 30th of July the Seras∣quier sat down before Gran, notwithstanding Five Hundred Impe∣rialists the day before were gotten into it; and that the Turks had in a manner encompassed it; opening the 31st thn Trench∣es, and raising Batteries upon the adjacent Hills, commanding the Town called St. George and St. Thomas. Whereupon the Duke of
Lorrain, the Elector of Bavaria, and Prince Waldeck, leaving be∣tween Sixteen and Seventeen Thousand men to maintain the Siege, under the Command of Count Caprara, and the Duke of Croy, on the 6th of Augut marched with the rest of the Army, either to fight the Serasqur, or oblige him to retire from before Gran; the whole Army at that time consisting of Twelve Thousand Im∣perial Horse, and Ten Thousand Foot; Two Thousand Bavarian Horse, and Six Thousand Foot; Twelve Thousand Lunenburghers Horse and Foot; Six Thousand Horse and Foot of the Elector of Cologn's Forces; and Three Thousand Five Hundred of Franco∣nia: in all about One and Fifty Thousand. The besieged, upon drawing off the greatest part of the Imperial Army, imagining that the Christians were about to raise the Siege, expressed much Joy with Musick and Acclamations; but were soon made sensible of their mistake, by the Volleys of small shot, and thundring of the Cannons, which made the Commanding Bassa offer to surren∣der the place, in case he might march out with the Garrison with their Arms, Baggage, and all the Cannon; with Drums beating, and Colours flying: but the Duke of Lorrain would not hearken to these Conditions. The Second of August the besieged came into the Ditch in two small Boats; but found there so good a Guard, that they were forced to retire without attempting any thing. On the Third day the Christians sounded the Ditch, and found there was between Four and Five Foot water: And the night following they raised a Battery of Twenty Pieces of Cannon on the Edg of the Ditch; and Collonel Bourgsdorff, Governour of Dusseldorff, who arrived in the Camp the day before, was killed with a Musquet-shot. The Fourth the Christians began to under∣mine the side of the Attack of the Troops of Brunswick, but the Turks very much hindred their Work with their Cannon and Small Shot: However it was continued and carried to the mid∣dle of the Line of Communication, over-against the Curtain, and a new Battery raised of Four Mortars. The Fifth the Enemy made so great a Fire from the new Battery they had raised in the mid∣dle of the Curtain, that the Christians who carried on the work, were put into some disorder, and a part of the Gallery ruined; as likewise many men killed and wounded, who were not suffi∣ciently covered: so that the rest were obliged to discontinue the work till night. The 7th, being the day whereon the Duke of Lorrain, &c. drew off, as aforesaid, for the Relief of Gran, by
the consent of the Emperor, to whom he had sent an Express to acquaint him with his Resolutions; the Attacks were strongly carried on, and the next day the Cannon from the Batteries play'd with such fury, that most of the Enemies Cannon was dismount∣ed. In which prosperous progress we will leave the Christians be∣fore Newheusel, and follow the Duke of Lorrain, with the other part of the Christian Army. The Serasquier Bassa besieging Gran with an Army of about Forty Thousand men, having raised, as aforesaid, his Batteries on the Hills of St. George and St. Thomas, several pieces of his Can∣non were dismounted by the Cannon of the besieged from the Castle: Yet on the First of August he caused his Trenches to be advanced: And on the Second the besieged, to hinder it, made a furious Sally, in which they killed about Two Hundred Turks. On the Third, the Turks attacked the lower Town, but were re∣pulsed with the loss of Three Hundred men, who were killed upon the place, and several Prisoners taken: when in the mean time the Duke of Lorrain having held a Council of War, it was resolved to march with the Army to fight the Enemy, leaving Sixteen or Seventeen Thousand men to make good the Siege of Newheusel. And the Count De Lamberg was sent to the Empe∣ror, to acquaint him with the Resolution that was taken; which the Emperor highly approving, the Count was sent back to the Duke, with Orders to pursue the same, who upon his Return, found all things were disposed for the March: but because a bo∣dy of the Enemy was posted at Novigrad, with a design when the Army had passed the Danube, to attempt the Relief of New∣heusel, his Highness caused several Retrenchments to be made for the security of the Camp, and defer'd his March till they were finished (which being done, on the 6th of August he set forward, and passing the Danube, advanced towards Gran, with a Resolu∣tion to fight the Enemy. But upon the approach of the Christi∣an Army, they quitted the Siege of Gran, and drew up in Bat∣talia behind a Morass, which could not be passed but by Deffiles, or Lanes; as likewise possessing Two Hills of difficult access, com∣manding the Plain by which the Christians must march to them; their Right Wing extending almost to the Danube, and their Left to a great Wood which covered the Flank. Whereupon the Duke of Lorrain drew up his Army in Battalia on the Plain, the most advantageously the Ground would permit; and in that posture
both Armies faced each other for the space of Three days. When on the 14th of August, at night, a Renegado Polander making his Escape from the Turkish Army, came into the Christian Camp, and informed the Duke, That the Serasquier having received an account, That the Christian Army was but Twenty Thousand strong, he resolved to attack them. His Highness thereupon, and to confirm the Enemy in their Opinion of the weakness of the Christians, and to engage them to a Fight upon more equal ground, retreated with the whole Army about an hours March towards Commorra; which the Turks perceiving the next morning, and that there was a sufficient Interval between the Morass and the Rear of the Christian Army, to draw up in Battalia, they passed the Deffiles; and having again formed themselves, advan∣ced towards the Christians with their usual shouts and crys, charg∣ing upon the Right Wing, commanded by the Elector of Bava∣ria and Prince Waldeck, who received them with that Bravery, Courage, and Firmness, that they did not long keep their ground. At the same time their Right Wing attacked the Left Wing of the Christians, and endeavoured to have fallen upon their Flank; but with as bad success as the other, being beaten off with much bravery. When being thus repulsed, and finding they were de∣ceived in the account they had of the Christians stength, they began to fall into great disorder; which was very much increased by the discharge of Thirty pieces of Cannon, laden with small shot, that upon the opening of the Christian Troops were fired upon them, and made a great slaughter; which so terrified them, that upon the Second discharge they betook themselves to flight, being pursued by the First Line of the Christians, and a consi∣derable number of Voluntiers, who gave in this occasion great proof of their Courage. So that the Turks re-passing the Deffiles in great confusion, were charged upon with such Fury, that a mi∣serable slaughter ensued: All that opposed were cut in pieces; and the Christians pursuing their Victory, entred their Camp, making themselves Masters of it; the Turks flying for safety to∣wards Buda; and after them were sent the Hungarians and Croats, with a detachment of Cuirassiers, commanded by the Baron De Mercy, the Count De Stirum, and Colonel Heusler, who cut off divers of the Rear. As for their Tents, Baggage and Artillery, the latter consisting of Three and Twenty Pieces of Cannon, and Four Mortars; all that they had there; they having left the
rest before Gran, they were taken by the Christians, 4000 Janizaries slain, and 2000 Spahies, besides 3000 that were computed to be killed at the Siege of Gran, with only the loss of a hundred Christians, not one Person of note killed or wounded, except the Sieur Van Dingen, General of the Battalia of the Troops of Franconia, who was wounded in the Shoulder; and the better to encourage the Pursuers, the Duke of Lorrain ordered, That whatever they took in the Pursuit, should fall to their own shares. After this Defeat of the Ottoman Army, his Highness marched back towards Newheusel in order to finish that Siege, but met the welcome News of its being taken; and a while after that, the Turks of Novi∣grad, an important place between Barkin and Pest, had demolished and deserted it upon their Magazines being fired with Lightning; which blowing up, beat down a great part of the Wall of the Town, and ruined the principal Bastion; whereupon he sent Colonel Heusler with 1500 Men to observe the place; who coming thither, found the Turks had quite abandoned it, and that they had nailed up what Cannon they were not capable of conveying thence; whereupon he left 200 Men in it, and returned with the rest to give his Highness an account in what Posture he found it: Whereupon 200 more were sent thither. Yet whilst the Turks besieged Gran, the Serasquier Bas∣sa had sent out 12000 Men to besiege Vicegrade, a small Imperial Garrison, consisting of no more than 300 Christians; but they de∣fended it with great Bravery, till 40 of them were killed, and 30 wounded. At what time perceiving the Miners were at work, and a great Breach made in the Wall, they capitulated to march out with Bag and Baggage to the Danube, where they embarked, and were con∣ducted by Water to the Imperial Camp: After which, the Turks de∣molished the place. But to return to Newheusel. In the absence of the Duke of Lorrain, the Count de Esterhasi ar∣riving in the Camp before Newheusel with 4000 Hungarians, left 2000 there, and with the other two thousand marched towards Gran, to joyn that part of the Army; which fresh Supply so encouraged the Besiegers, that having ruined the Bastions of the besieged, and dis∣mounted almost all their Cannon, a general Storm was resolved upon, and carryed on with such Success on the 19th of August, that in a short time the Besiegers lodged themselves upon one of the attackt Bastions; upon which the besieged placed three white Flags on the Retrenchment they had made within the Bastion, and desired to capi∣tulate, which was refused by the Besiegers, who, advancing, made
themselves Masters of that Retrenchment, and entred the Town, where they met with no opposition; the Turks endeavouring to save themselves in their Houses, but were all that were met in the first heat put to the Sword; 300 Turks seeing the place lost, retired into a Bastion, and from thence threw themselves, into the Ditch, where they were either drowned, or put to the Sword; so that of the whole Garrison very few escaped. The Bassa, a Renegado Bohemian, was wounded and made Prisoner, but sometime after died of his Wounds. A great number of Christian Slaves were released from their miserable Bondage, and the Turkish Officers, to whom Quarters were given, cast into Durance. In the place were found 80 brass Cannon, all dis∣mounted; 10 Mortars, 8 of which were likewise dismounted; forty thousand weight of Powder; so that with little loss, in consideration of the great and signal Success on the part of the Christians, on the 15th of August the Ottoman Army was defeated, and Newheusel reco∣vered, which cost the Turks so dear in taking; on the 19th of the same Month, 1685. upon which Vaccia and divers other places were abandoned by the Turks. Whilst these things were transacted in Hungary, General Mohila, Commander of the Cossacks, fell upon 10000 Tartars, who had post∣ed themselves near Ratiskaw, killing a great number of them, and put∣ing the rest to flight; so that in great disorder they repassed the Nic∣ster; and thereupon sent his assurance to the King of Poland, that he would ever remain faithful to him. The Bassa of Bossina, again attempting to besiege Dunare in Dalmatia, to repair his Honour, was, upon the Approach of the Venetian Troops, obliged to retire in great Disorder. And the Venetian Fleet joyned with the Gallies of the Pope, the great Duke of Tuscany being abroad in the Levant, Sig∣nior Molino with 30 Men of War, and 5 Galeasses was sent to cruise in the Archipelago, where he fell in with, and defeated a Turkish Con∣voy, composed of a great number of Saiquers laden with Provisions and Ammunition, going to Thessalonic, taking fourteen, and sinking most of the remainder; and at the same time the Venetians attacked Coron, advancing to the Body of that Town, battering it with seven pieces of Cannon, and as many Mortars, with which they ruined a great part of it, laying open a large Breach in the Wall; whereup∣on the Bassa Governour put up a white Flag, and desired to capitu∣late, but Captain General Morosini, Commander of the Venetians, let him understand, that he expected to have the place surrendred upon Discretion; which put the Bassa into such a Rage, that he immediate∣ly
caused a black Flag to be put up in its stead, signifying thereby his Resolution to defend it to the last; of whose Distress the Bassa of Petrasso having notice, drew together between 7 and 8000 Men, with which he marched to relieve the place; but on his way understanding the Strength of the Besiegers, he durst not attempt it, but contented himself with sending some Troops to re-inforce the Garrison of Mo∣den, and with falling upon the Greeks in that Neighbourhood, of whom he made a great slaughter, and afterwards possessed himself of Larini, a small place near Corinth. Whereupon the Siege of Coron, the principal City of Morea, was carried on with such Success, that upon a general Storm the besieged were beaten from their Defences, and the Besiegers entred with such Fury, that ere the heat was allay∣ed, 3000 Turks, together with their Bassa, were put to the Sword, and on the part of the Venetians only 400 killed; amongst which were two Knights of Malta, and Prince Philip of Savoy, the Prince of Brunswick, the Marquess of Courbon, the Marquess de St. Paule, with about thirty Knights of Malta, and some other persons of Quality were wounded. In the City were found 76 Pieces of Brass Cannon, with a great Quantity of Amunition and Provision. The Plunder of this Place was reckoned to amount to the value of two Millions of Livers: And beside the taking this Place, they defeated a great Body of Turks under the leading of Kallil, Vizier Bassa of Morea, killing above a thousand of them, together with the said Bassa, putting the rest to Flight, and possessing themselves of great Booty, besides nine Pieces of Cannon and two Mortars: Whereupon 300 Maynotes put themselves into the Service of the Republick, assuring the Captain General, That many more of their Associates would cast off the Turk∣ish Yoke, and follow their Example. The City of Esperies, notwith∣standing the feigned or pretended Submission, being encouraged by Count Teckely, refusing to open its Gates to the Imperial Forces, Ge∣neral Schultz, with the Forces under his Command, on the 20th of July came before it, having a good Train of Artillery, and the next day caused the Trenches to be opened, and carried, with the loss of one Man, near to the Ditch of the Town; at what time the place had in it a thousand Men in Garrison, not accounting the Burghers; and the same Night finished two Batteries, from which he played upon the besieged with great Fury, and they as resolutely fired upon the Impe∣rialists; whereupon three several Assaults were made with consider∣able Loss on both sides.
Whilst this Slege lasted, General Leslie having left his Cannon at Virovitza, marched the 9th of August with a Body of 6000 Men, and on the 10th came to Moustaroima, and in the Evening detach'd an Of∣ficer with 500 Croats and some Foot to invest Michalowitz, in which was a Garrison of 60 Men, who immediately surrendered it upon Di∣scretion, and the General put a Garrison of 200 into it. In the mean time the Turks made several signals from the Castles they have upon the Drave, and sent out Parties to give the Alarm to those of Esseck. On the 12 he continued his March towards Carassina; at what time the Bassa of Esseck advanced with 600 Horse, and charged his Vaunt∣guard, but was beaten back, and forced to retire in great Confusion, with considerable Loss; when on the part of the Imperialists, a Cap∣tain and 26 Soldiers only were killed. On the 13th he marched to∣wards Esseck, and being come into the great Plain not far from that place, he perceived a Body of 1000 Turkish Horse; their Foot, whose number the Christians could not exactly observe, being posted near the Town; upon which the General having drawn up his Forces in Battalia, commanded the Croats of the two Wings to advance and charge the Enemy; which they did with so much Resolution and Bravery, that the Turks soon fell into disorder, and in the end to plain Flight. Their Foot at the same time making what haste they could into the Town and Castle. Whereupon General Leslie gave or∣der to the Troops to attack the Town; which they performed with such Courage, that scaling the Walls, with their Swords in their Hands, the Turks endeavoured to save themselves, with their Wives and Children, by Water; and some by getting into the Castle; and of the former, many were taken in little Boats. As for this Town, it is large, there being in it about 500 Shops of several Trades, and two great Markets, which were then filled with great quantities of Rice, Corn, and other Provisions. The Pillage of which Town Count Leslie gave to the Soldiers; and having posted Guards to secure the Avenues, he went to view the Bridge which is 8000 paces in length on the other side the Drave, and 1100 on this side, being 12 paces broad, over which the Turks make their greatest Passage into Hunga∣ry; and there he found, that those who fled, had broken down a part on the other side of the River, to hinder the Christians from pursuing them; and that it would be very difficult to burn what was beyond that Breach. Whereupon he contented himself with burning that part on this side the Drave, which was soon destroyed with Fire; and 20 Soldiers swam the River, with a Resolution to set Fire on several
Mills on the other side; but upon the appearance of several Turks on the Banks, they thought convenient to return without effecting it. Up∣on this Success, the Croats desired General Leslie to give them leave to attack the Castle, to which he consented; but finding it more strongly fortified than they imagined, were obliged to quit their En∣terprise, after the loss of 50 of their Number; and on the 15th of August General Leslie marched back towards Michalowitz. Much about the same time the Governour of Carelstadt, the Count de Herberstein having concerted with the Chevalier Janco, General of the Morlaques, who had put themselves under the Protection of the Venetians to invade the Province of Corbavia; and that at the same time the Morlaques should make an Incursion into the Province of Lei∣cea, he marched from Carelstadt; with 2000 Croats and 1200 Valaques towards the Province of Corbavia, which he entred the 20th of July, and approached the Castle of Bunick, situate upon a Rock, having in it a Garrison of 120 Turks, but upon the first Summons the Go∣vernour capitulated, and came himself into the Camp to sign the Capitulation which was, That he, and all that were in Garrison with him, should have liberty to march out with Bag and Baggage, and all their Moveables to be conducted to Whias, or any other place he should chuse. Whereupon the Castle was the same day surrendred, together with the Cannon, which, by virtue of the Capitulation, was to re∣main there. The next day all the Christian Slaves were put into the Hands of Count Herberstein and Colonel Orsich, with two hundred men, took Possession, whilst another Party conducted the Garrison to Whias, formerly the capital City of Croatia: After which, a great many Families of the Valaques came and surrendred themselves, of∣fering to become Christians. Having burnt the Castle of Bunick, not being able to keep it, as lying too far from the Frontiers; and nail∣ing up three pieces of Cannon and three Mortars found there, the ways being inaccessible for Carriage, the Count marched to a large Plain on the side of Ʋdaina, from whence he sent out Parties which burnt and plundered all the Towns and Villages, and cut down all the Corn and Forrage for many Miles in compass; so that that sertile Province which the Turks possessed 140 years, is quite destroyed. And on the 29th of July the Count returned with a Booty of 600 Horses, 1300 head of Cattel, and some thousands of Sheep, and not having lost one man in this Expedition; and the Chevalier Janco, as it had been agreed on, entred the Province of Leicea with the like Success. But the like Success at present held not with the Poles; for the Troops of
that Kingdom drawing together but slowly, the Tartars had oppor∣tunity to make Incursions into the Countries of Podolia and the lower Russia, who burnt and destroyed a great number of Towns and Villages, carrying away the Inhabitants, together with much Booty. But a right understanding soon after being had between that Crown and the Czars of Moscovy; the latter giving the Cossacks under their Protection, liberty to joyn and act with those under the Protection of the former, a stop was put to those Incursions, and a great many Tartars who reiterated their Attempts, cut off. And the Sieur Lef∣niskie being abroad with some Troops, fell upon a Party of Tartars who were ravaging the Country, killing 300 of them, and releasing a con∣siderable number of Christians, whom they were carrying into mise∣rable Bondage. Whereupon the Bassa of Miedzibos writ to the Go∣vernours of the most considerable Places on the Frontiers of Poland be∣longing to that Crown, to propose a restraint of all Incursions on both sides, seeing such Enterprises only ruined the Countries, without any Advantage to the Princes their Masters. Yet the Polish Forces towards the latter end of July, took the Field, and the Crown Gene∣ral took a review of them at Gliniani, where he found them to con∣sist of 16000 Foot and 8000 Horse, giving order for their decamp∣ing the 29th of July, and marching to Visia, near the Niester, there to continue till other Troops, who had not been able so soon to joyn them, came up, as those of Lithuania, &c. The Serasquier Bassa, upon his Defeat near Gran, having rallied his Troops, caused two Bassa's, four Aga's, and some other Officers, who had not behaved themselves well in the Battel, to be strangled; and marching to Buda, passed the Danube, there giving out, That he would relieve Newheusel whatever it cost him; but upon the receipt of News that it was lost, he formed a new Train of Artillery which he took out of Buda, and marched towards Vaccia, incaruping be∣tween that place and Pest; whereupon the Duke of Lorrain repassed the Danube with the Imperial Army the 24th of August, near Comor∣ra, and advanced towards him: Upon which the Serasquier having sent a detached Party towards Agra, otherwise called Erla, and re∣passing the Danube, with the Gross of the Turkish Army, sent an Aga to the Duke of Lorrain to make some Overtures of Peace; to which his Highness answered; That he had no orders from the Emperor to treat of Peace; and that a victorious Army was not to be amuzed with such Proposals; and that he wondred the Serasquier, after giving out that he was resolved to fight the Christians, did now avoid it by so basty a Re∣treas.
To which the Aga replled. That the Country was so ruined on this side the Danube, that there was no Forrage for his Troops, and therefore he had been obliged to repass that River. Soon after the taking Newheusel, in defending of which, according to the Report of the Prisoners, between 5 and 6000 Turks were kil∣led. The Emperor appointed Count de Scherffenberg, Governour of it; into which the Duke of Lorrain before had put a considerable Gar∣rison, and summoned the Country-people to repair thither, in or∣der to clear the Works ruined during the Siege; causing, with all diligence, the Breaches to be repaired; and the Cannon, which, for the most part, were dismounted, and lay, in a manner, buried in the Ruines, to be re-mounted, a great number of Carpenters and Masons being sent thither from Vienna; and besides Vaccia and Novigrade, the Turks in some Consternation abandoned Hatwan (a place of that Consideration, that a Bassa commanded there) which they did in so much haste, that they had not time to demolish the Fortifications. The Serrasquier, upon his being deserted by 6000 Tartars, who left him at his repassing the Danube, in order to their return home sent back the Bassa's of Temeswar, Waradin, and Agria, with the Troops under their Command, to their respective Governments, and posted himself with the rest of his Forces between Buda and Alba Regalis; and now the danger being over on this side, the Elector of Bavaria taking his leave of the Duke of Lorrain, and principal Com∣manders of the Army, departed for Vienna; where, on the 9th of September, he arrived, and was joyfully received. Whilst these things were doing, General Scultz pressed on the Siege of Esperies, advancing to the Ditch, and placing his Galleries, doing great Execution with the Bomboys, and with the Cannon-shot, laying open a large Breach in the Wall; but the besieged, in hopes of being relieved by Count Teckely, made an obstinate defence, though his whole strength consisted not in above 1500 men; a great part of those that were in Arms with him having deserted him upon the Publication of the Emperor's Pardon, wherein none were exempted that should in time lay hold of that Clemency, and return to their Duty and Obedience (Count Teckely and two others excepted) which Pardon, the General, by the intimation of the Emperor, sent an Officer to make known to the besieged; but they not only refused to embrace it, but killed the Person that was sent to communicate it to them: Upon notice of which, the General was so incensed, that
he caused the Cannon to play incessantly upon the place, casting a great many Bomboys into it; which beat down, and ruined many houses. whereupon they hung out a White Flag, making signs to capitulate: But divers Officers approaching near, to understand what they had to say, they fired upon them, and killed some of them. The Vice-Roy of Croatia taking the advantage of the great consternation the Turks were in, about the beginning of Septem∣ber entred Bosnia with Five Thousand men, plundering and brun∣ing divers Villages: So that in Four days March he came before Dubitza, a very rich Town, with a Castle adjoyning to it, on the River Ʋnna; which the Croats, with little opposition, made them∣selves Masters of: And having possessed themselves of a great deal of rich plunder, set fire to it: But they in the Castle giving the Alarm to the neighbouring places, the Turks hastened from thence to their assistance: And having together formed a Body of about Fifteen Hundred men, they followed the Croats, and fell up∣on them in the Rear, as they were retreating: But facing about, they so well received them, that between Four and Five Hun∣dred Turks were killed, and the rest put to flight. And in this Action the Croats took Seven Colours, which by the Officer that brought the News, were presented to the Emperor. As for the Spoil they took, it was very great, consisting of Money and rich Com∣modities. This Series of success on the part of the Imperialists, obliged Ibrahim, the Serasquier Bassa, to keep on the other side the Danube, with the Forces that remained under his Command: and where Force could not, he resolved to try what Artifice could do: and thereupon dispatched a Letter to the Duke of Lorrain, by the Aga before mentioned; wherein he acquainted his Highness moreover, That he had full power from the Grand Signior, to treat and con∣clude a Peace; which he prayed him in the Name of God to pro∣mote, and content himself with the Honour he had gain'd, that an end might be put to the War which had spilt so much Blood, and caused the Ruin of many people; offering to abandon Teckely, and deliver to the Emperor his Hostages at Constantinople. But these Overtrues being usual with the Infidels when they are successless in their Wars, (they seldom keeping any League longer than con∣sists with their advantage) it was not thought convenient to en∣ter upon a Treaty, especially at a time when Hungary, that Here∣ditary
Kingdom, and Bulwark of Christendom, is in so fair a way to be freed from the Turkish Tyranny: Nor were the Pretences of Teckely any other ways resented. The Polish Troops being abroad, the Sieur Demideski, who com∣mands a Party in that Kingdom, having notice, that the Turks were marching to put a great Convoy into Caminiec, he drew out divers Troops, the better to strengthen him from the neighbouring Garrisons; and sent Orders to the Sieur Lesmiski, and Colonel Po∣tosch, immediately to joyn him with the Forces of their Division; which having done, they conjunctly marched to Cecchin; when near that place they were informed, That a Convoy, guarded by Five Thousand Turks, under the Orders of Suin Bassa, and two o∣ther Bassa's and Six Thousand Tartars, under the Command of Biologrod, and all under the Command of their General Smailo, was got into Caminiec: and that after a short refreshment, dividing into Four Bodies, one marched towards Zablatiow, and the others to∣wards Kossow, Sniatin, and Romanow; from whence, having made Incursions into Procutia, and Volinia, they re-joyned at Constanti∣now; where they were attacked by a Detachment from the Polish Army, and intirely routed, upwards of Two Thousand of them killed, and all their Baggage, together with the Booty they had got, taken; many of those that escaped the Field, being likewise set upon by the Country-people, were slain. The Besieged in Esperies beginning to dispair of being relieved by Teckely, and understanding 6000 men detached from that Ar∣my, commanded by the Duke of Lorrain, were on their March, to joyn General Schultz: That the Besiegers had placed their Galleries to the Wall; raising two Batteries on the Edge of the Ditch, and fixing their Miners to the Root of the Attack'd-Bastion; as also, that Six Hundred men, whom Count Teckeley sent to try if they could get into the place, had been routed. and divers of them killed, thought it high time to think of surrender∣ing that Important place. So that on the 10th of September the Go∣vernour desired a Parley, and a Cessation of Hostilities till the next, that in the mean time he might assemble the Inhabitants, to consider about the Articles of Surrender; which General Schultz looking upon as a Design to gain time, refused to consent to; demanding to have Two Officers immediately sent to him, as Ho∣stages. But to this the besieged refusing to comply, the firing from either side was renewed. But the next day the Governour
understanding the near approach of the Detachment from the Im∣perial Army, again desired a Parley, agreeing to send out a Lieu∣tenant and Two Burghers, upon condition the Besiegers would give as many Hostages on their part: which being agreed on in the Morning, and accordingly performed in the Evening, the Capitulation was agreed on and signed. The chief Articles being these; viz. The Magistrates and Burghers shall enjoy their Privileges, and the Places and Employments they are at present possessed of: but that all the Inhabitants shall be disarmed, and their Arms carried to the Town-house: That the Governour, and all the Officers, with such of the Garrison (which consisted of Three Hundred Germans, and Seven Hundred Hungarians) as desired it, should be received into the Emperor's Service, in the same quality they were then in; and that the rest should be conducted to some place as themselves should direct. Accordingly on the 12th of September, the City was surrendered, and the Governour, all the Germans, and most of the Hangarians entred into the Emperor's Service: the rest, Ten or Twelve excepted, voluntarily promising to return home, and ne∣ver again bear Arms against his Imperial Majesty. Teckely finding by the continual success of the Imperialists in the Ʋpper Hungary, his Interest weakened; and that the Turks were in no condition to assist him, began to think of retiring, with his Baggage and Treasure, into places of more safety: but being fal∣len upon in his March, he was routed by a Party of Croats; all, or the greatest part of his Treasure taken, and a great many of his Rebellious Party killed: So that he appeared not publickly in many days. Whereupon, besides Tokay, Oneth, Potack, and Serentz, Palottz, Doronitz, Woldockin and Sparditz, surrendered, and were taken into the Imperial Protection: By which, and the like means most of the Towns in both the Hungaries are in the possession of the Emperor. Nor on the part of the Venetians is the Success less in taking Calamata and Zarnata, and defeating the Captain Bassa, who advanced to the Relief of the former, with Ten Thou∣sand men, killing a great many of them, and taking much Spoil: For which Victories, &c. Te Deum was sung in the Church of St. Mark, at Venice. The Poles likewise much about the same time routed two Parties of Turks and Tartars, sent out by the Serasquier Solyman, to ravage the Country. The Republick of Venice (after having taken Zarnat and Cala∣mata, as likewise defeated the Turkish Captain Bassa, who came
to succour the Towns) marched towards Navarina; to which march the Bassa rallying his broken Troops, endeavoured to put a Stop; but being warmly received by General Morosini, 4000 of his Men were slain, and all the Cannon and Baggage taken. Much a∣bout the same time the Vaivode Junco understanding that 3000 Turks were marching with a Design to plunder the Suburbs of Sebenico, laid an Ambush of 1200 Morlaques, who fell upon them, putting the greatest part to the Sword; which continual Current of Success caused much Consternation amongst the Infidels in those parts; and the ra∣ther, by reason many of the small Fortresses either surrender'd upon the first Summons, or after inconsiderable Resistance; amongst which are Porto Vitulo, Chiesisa, Passava, and Portoquaglia. Chascaw in the upper Hungary, consisting of a Garrison of 4000 Re∣bels, the most resolute of Teckely's Party, refusing the Imperial Amnesly, was besieged by the Forces under the Command of Count Caprara; to relieve which, Teckely made some inconsiderable Attempts, but not finding himself strong enough to force the Leaguers, Peterhasi, one of his principal Commanders, under pretence of coming over to the Imperialists with 600 Horse, and insinuating a Design he had to per∣swade the besieged to surrender, got into that strong place, leaving his Baggage valued at 100000 Florins, as a Pledge of his Fidelity, in the Imperial Camp; but instead of performing his Promise, he, on the contrary, encouraged them to an obstinate Defence; so that by the continual firing, and in divers Sallies a considerable number of men were killed on either side; yet upon News of Count Teckely's being secured in Irons by the Turks, that important place surrendred: The account of which is thus; Teckely finding himself too weak to defend that Place, on the safe∣ty of which his hopes of keeping up his Credit with his Party, and longer continuance in the upper Hungary were founded, he sent to the Bassa of great Waradin to let him know what Danger it was in, urging the great Importance of te place, pressing for speedy Succour, in order to relieve it: And though in this case he doubted not to suc∣ceed, as appeared by his Letters intercepted, wherein he exhorted the besieged to make a resolute Defence, and expect Relief within twenty days. The Bassa, the better to dissemble what was intended, returned him this Answer; That he was not ignorant how much it con∣cerned them to preserve That Town, and that he would give him all the assistance he could. But about eight days after he sent a Message, acquainting him, That he could not furnish him with the number of
Men he required, by reason he had received other Orders from his Master the Grand Signior, of great Consequence to the common Cause, which were not convenient to be communicated to him by Letter, and therefore desired him to repair to Waradin, that he might inform him by word of mouth; and that he might not doubt his Security, he sent him a Pass-port, which so much confirmed him, that accompa∣nied with Petrozzi, and some others his principal Adherents, he went with a Guard of five hundred Horse, and was met by the Bassa without the Gates, and by him received with all the appearance of Kindness and Esteem. Being conducted into the Town with only eight of his Attendants as a seeming Welcome, all the Cannon was discharged, with other Marks of Respect. When the Bassa having entertained him at Supper, and that ended, an Aga, with a Guard of Janizaries entred the Room, and told him, he had Orders from the Grand Signior to seize him, and carry him to Adrianople; and there∣upon caused Irons to be put upon his Hands and Feet. Petrozzi being present, the Bassa told him, That the Grand Signior gave him the Principality and Command which Teckely had, and that he would assist him with all his Forces. To this he seemed to consent, but being got out of the place, and coming to the five hundred Horse that had attended Teckely thither, he told them what had happened, and withal exhorted them to return to that Obedience they owed the Emperor, as their Sovereign, and to put themselves into his Service; which they consenting to he marched at the Head of them directly to the Imperial Camp before Chascaw, sending to the rest of Teckely's Party, with Admonition to follow the like Example, which they so readily consented to, that his number by that time he entred the Camp, was increased to near 7000, to whom General Caprara al∣lowed the Benefit of the Imperial Amnesty; and sent Petrozzi into Chascaw to give the besieged an Account of what had befaln Teckely, their Ring-leader, and the danger they were in, by reason of the Mines that were ready to be sprung at the Foot of the Wall. Upon notice of which, they came to a Resolve to surrender the place, which they did upon advantageous Articles, on the 25th of October 1685. when all the Germans that were in the place, to the number of 180, took the Oath of Fidelity, and were admitted into the Imperial Re∣giments; and such Hungarians as desired it, permitted to return to their respective Habitations. Following the Example of this strong place, almost all the Towns in the upper Hungary surrendred; so that the Infidels have but narrow footing in that Kingdom. The King of
Poland prosecuting his Success, after six days skirmishing with the Turks and Tartars, gave them Battle the 10th of October, and after five Hours dispute, put them to flight, with great Slaughter, taking di∣vers Prisoners of note, as likewise Standards, and the most part of their Baggage. This Victory was obtained, notwithstanding the Enemies Army treble the number; nor were the Cassacks in the Ser∣vice of that Crown, less active for besieging Jarolick, a Town on the Niester; they took it, and put the Garrison consisting of 1200 men mostly to the Sword. And thus Rebellion lost its aim, whilst the Power of the Infidels is reduced to a Crisis: The whole Ottoman Empire upon the sense of such reiterated Losses, being ready to mutiny; and turn all things into Confusion: And now the Imperialists being mostly gone into their Winter-quarters, we will conclude the Actions of this glorious Campaign. FINIS.
