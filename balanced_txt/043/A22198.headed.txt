royal blazon or coat of arms ¶ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation declaring His Maiesties further pleasure for matter of Buildings. WHereas in the second yeere of Our Reigne of great Brit∣taine, for diuers reasons of State, and the generall good and safety of this Our Common-wealth, We did cause Our Procla∣mation to bee published for restraint of new Buildings, and for reedifying old Houses with bricke, or bricke and stone, within Our City of London and two miles of the Gates thereof, which hath bene seconded by diuers other Our Proclamations made and published, aswell in the fift and sixte, as in the ninth & sixteenth yeres of Our Reigne: all which, many persons out of a priuate respect of their owne gaine, without regard of Our Commandements, or the generall & common good so often mentioned in the said Proclamations, haue taken the boldnesse to violate; so as contrarie to Our disposition, We haue bene inforced (for preuention of the growing euill) to cause due proceedings to bee held against some of the offenders against Our Proclama∣tion in Our High Court of Starre-chamber, where order hath bene giuen for demoli∣shing the houses of diuers offenders in that kinde, and of others who haue built vpon new foundations; wherein Wee finding the number of offenders to be so many, as if We should haue proceeded against all of them in such exemplary forme of Iustice, Wee should haue caused great deuastation in Our City of London & the places adiacent thereunto, Neuerthelesse the offences being alike, it could not stand with the rule of Our Iustice to make some examples of Our displeasure and let others passe with impunitie: Wee were therefore graciously pleased to graunt a commission lately to certaine persons of trust; giuing them power to call before them such as had offended against Our sayd Proclama∣tions, and for Vs and on Our behalfe to compound with them for their offences, there∣by to deterre them and others for aduenturing the like in time to come.
And whereas some Mechanicall persons inhabiting in or about Our Citie of London, who to worke their owne endes in point of profit, haue beene the principall occasion of so great deformitie in Buildings, by reason of so many base Tenements and Cottages of late yeeres erected within the Suburbes of Our saide Citie, which Wee are pleased to make Our Chamber, and whereunto so many States and Nations haue recourse by their daily repaire vnto Vs: so the same persons, or others of worse condition, finding themselues checked or restrained by the directions giuen in Our last Proclamation for the building with bricke, doe endeuour to possesse by kind of infection spread into the minds of many Our good and well disposed Subiects, that the end of such Our Royall comman∣dement should be extended to some pecuniary dispensation, or wholly to be released vpon suits to bee made vnto Vs: Wee minding nothing▪ lesse, haue thought fit to declare Our selues and Our further pleasure herein, that Wee are so farre from giuing any toleration or release in that kinde, as wee are resolued, aswell out of many reasons of State condu∣cing to Our honour, and the honour of Our Posteritie, as for the publicke preseruation of Our People from the danger of fire, constantly to vpholde and continue Our late pre∣script for Building with bricke or stone, and not otherwise, nor in any other forme or maner then in this present Proclamation is prescribed; which the better to manifest Our full and absolute pleasure therein, wee haue caused to be againe renewed and remembred to Our People whom it may concerne. And Wee hauing been lately mooued by some of Our Commissioners imployed in this Our seruice, for some further grace and fauour to be extended to such of Our Subiects as now are, or shall bee willing to conforme themselues, and to reedifie their dwelling houses with Bricke or Stone, and to wayue and auoyd that noysome pester of Bulkes, Stalls, Shedds, Cants, and Iuttyes, wherewith Our Streetes are in all places so much cumbred and annoied, that it taketh away the benefit of ayre, sweetnes, and decency of the same; And that Wee would bee pleased to inlarge their authority for the setting foorth of the foundation or ground of euery one that shall so conforme in such sort, as may best beautifie the Street where such buildings are, and may encourage those that will new build their houses, and hold vniformitie through the whole Range of such Street or Streets where such buildings are: whereunto Wee graciously inclyning, haue by Our Commission vnder Our great Seale of England, giuen them such power and authoritie in that behalfe, as shall seeme good to their wisedomes and discretions, and as may agree with the conueniencie and decencie of the place, and the widenesse of the Street where such building or reedifying shall bee. Lastly, to the end that from hencefoorth no more or further toleration or conniuencie bee vsed towards them that shall contemptuously oppose Our royall commandement in Buildings, or shall seeke by deuises and shifts to auoide the direction thereof, onely by making new the lower Storie of any dwelling house of Timber, or by leauing the lower Storie standing, doe new build the vpper part of their houses with Timber, or doe in∣large any part of their houses towards the street with Iuttyes, or Cant Windowes, or otherwise: Wee heereby command Our Attourney generall, that hee from time to time vpon certificate of such or any other case of offence in Building, contrary to Our sayde Proclamations to bee made from Our sayd Commissioners, or any foure or more of them, vnder their hands in writing, doe proceed for Vs, and in Our name against such of∣fenders
and euery of them, aswel by way of Bill or information to be exhibited into Our high Court of Starre-chamber, as otherwise vpon the examination and confession of the sayd offenders or any of them, taken before Our sayd Atturney, according to the course and Presidents of Our said Court in like cases. And Wee further will and command the Lord Maior of the Citie of London, and the Aldermen, and Recorder of the saide Citie, for the time being, and also all and euerie Our Iustices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs, & all other Our Officers, and louing Subiects, aswel within Liberties as without, within Our Counties of Mid∣dlesex, and Surrey, to bee ayding, and assisting to Our saide Commissioners, and euery of them, in the due execution of Our pleasure heerein, as they, and euery of them will bee accomptable for the same when Wee shall require it. And to the end that Our Subiects, within the places and limits aforesaide, may be the better forewarned and taught to per∣forme their obedience in the premisses, which We straitly will and require at their hands: OVr expresse will and pleasure is, That in erecting of new Buildings hereafter, euery whole Story of and in such houses, and Buildings, and all and euery the roomes of such whole Story, shall bee of the height of tenne foote of assize at the least, and euery halfe Story of and in such houses, and Buil∣dings, shall bee of the height of seuen foote, and a halfe at the least; and that the forefront and outward Walles, and the Iambes, Heads, and Soyles of the Windowes shall be of Bricke, or of Bricke and Stone, and the Windowes (being of Timber) not to bee put in vntill the Iambes and heads aforesaide bee fini∣shed and beare of themselues. And if the saide Buildings doe not exceede two Stories in height, then the Walles thereof shall bee of the thickenes of one Bricke, and halfe a Brickes length, from the ground vnto the vppermost part of the said Walles: And where the Building shall be of the height of two Stories, the Walles of the first Story shall be of the thickenes of two Brickes length, and from thence vnto the vppermost part of the Wall, of the thickenes of one Bricke and halfe a Brickes length. And that in Building of the saide houses, there shall bee no Iutties or Iutting, or Cant-windowes, either vpon Timber Ioystes, or otherwise, but the Walles to goe direct and streight vpwards, and at the setting off, a water Table to bee made; Also the lights of the Windowes of euery whole Story, to be of more height then breadth, to the end the roomes may receiue ayre for health, and that there may bee a sufficient peere of Bricke, betweene the windowes for strength; And likewise the windowes of euery halfe Story to be made square euery way, or neere thereabouts. And lastly, that all Shops in euery Principall Streete of Trade, be made with Pillasters of hard Stone, or Bricke, and the heads of the Shop windowes cut in wedges Archwise, to sustaine the Wall about it, and for ornament of the Streets. Giuen at Newmarket, the twelfth day of March, in the sixteenth yeere of our Raigne of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the two and fiftieth. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO. M.DC.XVIII.
