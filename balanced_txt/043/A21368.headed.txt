¶The prologue of a doctour in recōmendation of Arystotle the prynce of phylosophers. GOd almyghty saue our kynge / & the glory of all his frendes / and cōferme his realme in the faythe of god. And cause hym to rey∣gne in thexaltacyon / prayse / and honour of his people. I whiche am seruaunt to the kynge haue put in execution the werke of his cōmaū¦dement / in getynge a boke of good maners to his go∣uernaūce. The whiche boke is called the secrete of se∣cretes / made by the prince of phylosophres Arystotle the sone of Mahonnet of Macedony / to his dysciple ye emperour Alexander sone of Phylyp kynge of Mace∣dony the which Alexandre had two crownes. This sayd boke Arystotle cōpyled in the oldenesse of his bo∣dy / bycause, that he might no more trauayle nor ryde to do suche besynesses as Alexander had put into his charge. For Alexādre had made hym gouernour and mayster aboue all other bycause he was a man of ve¦ray good councell / of grete clergy / and subtyll vnder∣standyng. And incessantly studyed good & gracyous maners / & scyences spyrytuall / contemplatiues / and charytables. He was a wyse man / & meke / louynge reason and Iustyce / & euer reported ryght wysnesse & trouthe. And therfore many phylosophres rpute hȳ of the nombre of prophetes. And say yt they had foūde dyuers bokes of the grekes which god had sent hym by his moost excellent aūgell / saynge to hym. I shall make ye to be called in ye worlde more an aungell than a man. And wyte ye yt Arystotle dyde in his lyfe ma∣ny sygnes whiche were straunge in workes & mer∣uayles /
whiche were to longe to be accōpted. Before his dethe he dyde many straunge werkes wherfore a relygyon & cōpany peryadyc sayd & helde opynion that he had ben in heuē in lykenesse of a douue of fyre And as longe as he lyued Alexander ouercame all y• worlde through his coūcell. And all landes by the fa∣me of hym / were put vnder the imperyall cōmaūde∣mēt & in lykewyse they of Perce / & Araby. and there was none yt durst gaynsay Alexāder / in worde nor de¦de. And y• sayd arystotle made many goodly epystles for ye loue yt he had to Alexander / & for to cause hym to knowe all y• secretes he made an epystle here vnder wryten / y• which he sent to Alexander. And whā Ale∣xander had ouercome y• realme of Perce / & set y• moost of them in his prysōs / he sent an epystle to Arystotle whiche foloweth. b. ¶An epystle yt alexander sent to Arystotle. DOctour of Iustyce & right noble phylosopher we sygnyfy to thy hygh wysdome / y• we ha∣ue sent in y• realme of Perce many mē / whiche haboū¦de gretly in reason / & vnderstōdyng / subtyl & pentra¦yfe wherfore al we haue intencyō to put thē to deth. Howbert as thou semest best sygnyfy vs by thy let∣tres. c. ¶An epystle y• Arystotle sent to Alexander. YF thou can moeue & chaūge the ayre frome y• erth & water / & ye ordynaūce of thy cytees to cōplysshe thy pleasure yf thou can do it ceas of / &
do it not / but gouerne thē in thy goodnesse / and exal thē in benygnyte. And yf thou do thus I hope with the grace of god that they all shall be thy frendes to all thy good pleasures and commaundemētes. And for the loue that they shall haue in the / thou shalt pea¦sybly reygne ouer thē in grete vyctory. ¶And whan Alexander had red this epystle / he dyde after his coū¦cell / and they of Perce were more obedyent to hym than to any other nacyon. ¶The prologue of a doctour named Phyly that translated this bo∣ke in to latyn. d. PHyly that translated this boke in o latyn was a chylde of Parys / & was a veray wyse interp̄tour & vn¦derstander of languages / & he sayd hus. I haue not knowē nor seen ty¦e that the phylosophers haue hoē / or haue ben acustomed to helpe or to make all weckes or all secretes but that I haue sought / nor haue knowē by no mā by whome I kne∣we that he had knowlegyng of ye scryptures of Phy¦losophers / but I haue vysited hym vnto y• tyme y• I came to ye knowlege of councell / yt whiche was Estu¦lapideus / & a man solytary & of grete abstynēce and veray wyse in phylosophy / to whom I meked me dy¦lygently / requyrynge hym that he wolde shewe to me the scryptures of the knowlege of the sonne / the whiche he gaue vnto me / with a ryght good wy
And surely I foūde as moche as I desyred / & all that I had ben about a hole yere / & wherfore I had longe tyme trauayled. And I thus hauynge my desyre re∣torned home with grete ioye / yeldyng thākes to god my creatour. ¶And than at the request of the moost noble kynge with grete study & labour I translated this boke out of Greke lāguage into Caldees tongue & syth in to the speche of Araby. The which boke the moost wyseman Arystotle made / whiche answered alwayes to all the requestes of kynge Alexandre / as more playnly appereth in this present boke. b. ¶An epystle sent to kyng Alexandre by Arystotle. RYght glorious sone and ryght wyse / god cō¦serue the in the walke of knowlegyng the wayes of trouthe & vertues / and wtdrawe thy carnall and beestly desyres / & conferme his realme to his seruyce / & to thy honour. Letynge the wyte deere sone yt I haue receyued thyn epystle reuerently & honourably as it apperteyneth / and playnly haue vnderstāde the grete desyre that y• hast that I were personally with the. Meruaylyng how I can absteyne me fro the. Reprouynge me of yt I care but lytel for thy besynesses. For y• which cause I haue ordeyned & hasted me to make a boke for the / the which shall weye & conteyne all my werkes / sup¦plyenge myn absence & defautes and shall be to the a ryght certayne rule & doctryne in all thynges y• thou wyllest. The whiche I wyll shewe as I were pre∣sently with the. Dere sone thou ought not to repreue nor blame me / for thou knowest well yt for nothyng of
the worlde / but that I wolde go to the. And yf were not yt I am so sore greued / and ladē with aege & wey∣kenesse of my persone / wherby in no wyse I cā go to the. And wyte thou / that ye thynge which thou hast demaunded of me / and that thou so moche desyrest to knowe & haue is ye secretes that nature humaynes thought scantly can compryse nor susteyne. How thā may in the hert of mortall man be wryten or vnder∣stande that thynge that he ought not to knowe. And that thyng that is not behouefull nor couenable to be spoken of. Howbeit I am bounde by veray duety to answere to that / that thou demaundest. I shall ne∣uer other thȳge shewe the / but that whiche is wry∣ten in this boke. For yf thou rede it dylygently / and vnderstande it playnly / and that thou mayst knowe yt is cōteyned in it / without doubt thou shalt haue all that that thou desyrest. For god shal gyue ye suche gra¦ce / suche vnderstandynge / and subtylte of grete wyt and scyence / and also by the doctryne yt I haue gyuē the afore tyme / that by thy selfe thou mayst knowe & cōceyue that whiche thou desyrest. And ye cause why that I haue opened and related my secretes fygura∣tyuely & somwhat derkly / & that I haue put obserue exāples / and by fygures / is that I doubt & feare mo¦che that this boke sholde come to the handes of intect persones / & in the power of arrogant & euyll folkes / which myght knowe ye secretes of god. And god kno∣weth wel that they be not worthy. Certaynly I ma¦ke grete doubt yt I in this trespace not ye wyll and y• grace of god. I do relate & dyscouer this thynge / as it hath bē reuelate of god (or now) vnto ye. wye thou then ryght dere sone that I haue dyscouered to ye the
thynges that bē to be hyd. And yf thou dyscouer the∣se secretes / thou shalt haue shortly euyl fortunes / and mayst not be sure frome grete harmes that shall be comynge towarde the. But almyghty god kepe the & me from suche thynges / & from all dyshonest thyn∣ges. And after all these thynges haue in thy mynde this noble & prouffytable doctryne / ye I make redy to the / & intēde to expose thy noble hert / to informe it to thy grete solace / as myrour of helth yf thou wylt ap¦ply y• ther Moost dere sone it behoueth euery kyng o haue ow thȳges to susteyne hym & his royalme. But he maye not stedfastely haue it / but yf he haue good & grete gouernaūce of thē that ought to gouer∣ne. And he yt reygneth so is obeyed of his subgectes. And his subgectes egally wt one courage / & by one sel¦fe forme shalbe obedyēt to ye lorde. For by y• dysobedy∣ence of ye subgectes y• power of ye lorde is gretly eblys¦shed. And yf y• subgectes reygne / ye gouernaūce may nothyng do. And I shall shewe the / ye cause wherfore ye subgectes be styred & couraged to obey theyr lorde. two thynges ther is. The one is outwarde & ye other inwarde. It is not lōgelyth I declared to the y• that is outwarde. That is to wyte / whan ye lorde spēdeth wysely his rychesse amonge his subgectest / and y• he in them worke lyberalyte / & yt he gyue to echone as they be worthy. And therwt ye kynge behoueth to ha∣ue a wyle / wherof I shall make mencyon in ye chapy¦tre of vyces & helpes. That is to wyte that y• kynge ought to enforce hym to get ye hees of his subgectes by good werkes. And this is y• fyrst degre & foūdacy∣on in doyng of his dedes by .ii. thȳges. One inward & y• other outwarde. The cause outwarde is y• y• kyn∣ge
do & mayntene Iustyce / y• possessyons & rychesses of his subgectes / & y• he be pyteous a mercyfull. The cause inwarde is yt he honoure grete lerned men / & yt he haue thē for recōmēded. For god hath recōmēded thē theyr scyēce. And I recōmēde y• this secrete pr∣cypally wt dyuers other / whiche thou shalt fynde in other chapytres of this boke / wher thou shalt fynde grete wysdome & doctryne / & y• cōtent of y• fynal cause wherby thou shalt fynde thy prȳcypall purpose. n it thou shalte lerne ye sygnyfycacyons / of y• wordes & obscurytees of ye examples. Thā thou shalt & {per}fytely haue that yt thou desyrest. wherfore pray to god moost wyse & gloryous kynge y• he wyll lyghten thy reason & vnderstandynge to thede yt thou knowe & {per}ceyue ye secretes of this seyēce. And me thou mayst be myn heyre & successour / & y• he wyt graūt y• largenesse of goodes / to gyue haboūdaūce to y• lyuyng of wyse mē & studyēres / wt grace to knowe yt whiche is dyfficyle / & wtout the same nothyng can be done. e. ¶Of ye maner of kynges as touchyng largesse. THere be .iiii. maner of kynges. There is a kynge yt is lyberall to hym selfe / & lyberall to his subgectes. There is a kynge y• is ly∣brall to hym selfe & hauyng to his subge∣ctes. The ytalyens say y• it is no vyce to a kynge y• is hauynge to hymselfe / & lyberal to his sub¦gectes The Ioyes say yt ye kyng is good y• is hauȳg to hymself / to his subgectes. The Percyēs say ye cō¦trary & bē / of  yt ye kyng is not worthy yt is not large to hȳselfe & hauȳg to his subgectes. But amōg
all y• kynges aboue sayd he is the worst / & ought in no thynge to be praysed yt is not lyberall to hym selfe & to his subgectis. For he yt is hauynge to hym selfe & to his subgectis / his realme shall be clene destroyed. Thā it behoueth vs to enquere of ye vertues & vyces aboue sayd / & to shew what thȳg largesse is & wher in the errour of largesse lyeth / & what harmes come for lacke of largesse. It is euydent that the qualytees bē to be reproued whā they go fro y• meaue / & be aua∣rycyous folysshe lyberall. But yf thou wyll enque∣re or seke largesse / regarde & consyder thy power / and y• tyme of the necessyte / & ye merytes of mē. And than thou ought to gyue as thy power wyll (by measu∣re) to them yt haue nede / & be worthy of it. For he y• gy¦ueth otherwyse he breketh ye rule of largesse & syn̄eth And he that gyueth his goodes to hym that hath no nede / he getteth no thākes. And al yt he gyueth to thē y• be not worthy / is lost. And he y• spendeth his good outragyously / shall soone come to y• wylde brymmes of pouerte / & is lyke hym y• gyueth victory to his ene¦myes ouer hym. But a kynge yt gyueth his goodes mesurably to thē yt haue nede / is lyberall to hym selfe and his subgectes And his realme shal come to grete {pro}speryte / & his cōmaūdemēt shalbe fulfylled. And he y• spēdeth y• good of his realme wtout ordre / & gyueth to thē y• be not worthy / & to thē y• haue no nede / such a kynge destroyeth his people / & y• comyn welthe / & is not worthy to reygne as a kyng. And ye name of aua¦ryce is an ouer foule name to a kyng / & to moche har¦me cometh to his regall mageste. Therfore yf a kyng wyl reygne honourably / hym behoueth not to haue y• one nor the other of these vyces / y• is to wyte / that
he be not to lyberall / nor to coueytous. And yf ye kyng wyl be coūceyled / he ought wt grete dylygēce to pour¦uey hym of a wyse mā / whiche shall be chosē amōge all other / to whome he shall cōmyt his doynges of y• realme / & the gouernaūce of the rychesses of the same as they ought to be spent. f. ¶Of largesse and auaryce / and of many other vyces. KYnge Alexander moost dere sone I tell the certaynly that yf ony make greter expen∣ce thā his realme  asusteyne / that he en∣clyneth to folysshe largesse & auaryce. Su∣che a kynge without doubt shalbe dysto∣yed. But yf he inclyne to lyberalyte / he shal haue per¦petuall glory of his realme / yf he drawe hym fro ta∣kynge ye goodes & possessyons of his subgectes. And wyte thou dere sone that I fynde wryten of a grece doctour named Hermogynes whiche sayth that the gretest & souerayne goodnesse / bryghtnesse of vnder∣standyng / & plente of lawe / scyēce & perfeceyō of a kyn¦ge is y• it behoueth to kepe hym fro takynge of the goodes and possessyons of his subgectes. It hath ben ye vndoynge of many realmes. For dyuers kyn∣ges haue made greter & outragyous expences thā y• stynt of theyr realmes coude extende / wherfore they toke the goodes and landes of theyr subgectes. For y• whiche iniuryes doynge ye people cryed to god / whi∣che sent vengeaūce on the sayd kynges. In suche wy¦ce that theyr people rebelled agaynst them & put thē to destrucey. And wtout the grete mercy of god that
susteyned thē / y• realmes shold haue bē vtterly dystro¦yed wt ye people. Thou thē oughtest to absteyne ye frō outragyous expēces / & ought to kepe tēperasice in ly¦beralyte. And gete not the derke secretnesse & repro∣ches that thou shalt haue / for beloneth not to thē that be good. g. ¶Of vertues & vyces / & of ye doctryne of Arystotle THe substaūce of all vertuo reygnyng is to gyue to thē yt be good / & {per}don iniuryes / ho¦noure & bere reuerēce to thē yt be worthy / & haue mynde of thē yt he meke / & amēde yt de fawtes of them yt be symple / & wt good wyl saue ye people / & kepe y• fro to moche spekyng / let imu¦ryes passe tyll thouse the tyme of defence yt thou kno∣we not ye foly of roles. Dere soue I haue taught ye & shal teche y• many thynges ye whiche thou shalt kepe in thy hert. And I ensure ye yt ye sayd rechynges shall always be there in al thy doȳges & weckes. Bryght & suffycyēt scyence of physyke shortely cōprysed thou shalt haue. And I wolde neuer haue shewed the ony thynge / but yt y• sayd scyence wt yt techynges yt folowe ought to suffyse the & thy werkes in this worlde and in the other. h. ¶Of the vnderstandynge. DEre sone knowe thou yt ye vnderstādynge is ye chyef of ye gouernaūce of mā / & helth of the soule / keper of vertues / & of vyces. For in ye sayd vnderstādynge we beholde the thynges yt be to be chosen. It is ye key
of vertues / & the rote of all laudable goodes. And the best instrumēt therof is to haue good fame. And yf it be contraryly done / it shal be cōfounded at the last by yll fame. A kynge ought pryncypally seke to haue a good fame. More for the gouernȳge of his reame thā for hym selfe. i. ¶Of ye fynall intencyō y• a kynge ought to haue. FOr the begynnynge of largesse that a kynge ought to haue / is to haue good fame / wher∣by the grete realmes & grete lordysshyppes be gotē. And yf thou desyrest to get realmes or lordysshyppes / yf it be not by good fame / thou shalt gete none other thynge but enuy. And enuy bredeth lesynges / whiche is mater and rote of all vyces. En∣uy bredeth yll speche / yll speche bredeth hate: hate bre¦deth vniustyce / vniustyce bredeth batayle / batayle breketh all lawe / dystroyeth cytees / and is cōtrary to nature. Than thynke dere sone & set thy desyre to get good fame / and thou shalt haue in the crouth and all thynges laudable / for it is cause of al welth. For it is cōtrary to lesynges / whiche is mater of all vyces / as it is sayd. And trouth engendreth the desyre of Iusty¦ce. Iustyce engendreth good saythe. Good faythe en∣gēdreth famylyaryte. Famylyaryte engēdreth frend¦shyp. Frendshyp engendreth councel and helpe. And for this cause all the worlde was ordeyned / & the la∣wes made which be conenable to reason and nature. It appereth than that the desyre to haue good fame is honourable and perdurable lyfe. k. ¶Of euylles yt folowe flesshely desyre.
ALexander fayre sone leue thy beestly desy∣res of thy flesshly appetyte / for they be cor¦ruptibles. The flesshely desyres draweth thy hert to beestly corrupcyō of y• soule wt¦out ony dyscrcyon / & dryeth y• body of mā wotest thou what flesshely loue bredeth? It bre∣deth auaryce / auaryce bredeth desyre / desyre bredeth rychesse and maketh a man wtout care / to be a prou∣de man / without lawe / and a thefe. Theft bryngeth a man to shame / and fynall destruccyon of his body. l. ¶Of the wysdome and ordy∣naunce of a kynge. IT is behouefull & ryght that y• good fame of a kynge / be in honourable scyence and wor∣thynesse (thoroughout al realmes) to be shed frome his realme / and haue cōmunycacyon of theyr wyse councel with his. And therby he shall be praysed / honoured / & doubted of his sub∣gectes / whan theyse y• he speketh and doth his wer¦kes wysely. For easely is perceyued the wysdome or foly of a kynge / for whā he gouerneth hym in wor¦thynesse towarde his subgectes / he is worthy to rey¦gne honourably. But he that putteth his realme in seruytude or thraldom / of euyll customes / he breketh the way of veryte. And dyspyseth the good way and lawe of god. And at y• last be dyspraysed of all folkes / as he hath desered. m ¶Of the worthynes / relygyon / and holynesse of a kynge.
ANd yet agayne well beloued sone I tell y• that the phylosophres haue spoken and sayd. It behoueth that ye royall mageste be gouerned by ryghtwysnesse / & not by faynt apparence / but in dede / to thende y• euery man may se and knowe clerely the goodnesse of the kynge / and that he feare god. And wyll be go∣uerned in godly wayes / than shall he be honoured & doubted. And yf he shewe hym selfe faynynge to be good / and is nought to his subgectes / his yll wer∣kes can not be hyd / nor it may not be but his people shall knowe it He shall be dyspysed of god & shamed in the worlde. And his dedes shalbe lessed / & the ho∣noure of the crowne of his realme shall fayle. what shall I tell ye more? there is no treasure in this world to good fame. And moreouer dere one / it besemeth y• thou worshyp clerkes / and pouerte of good men of relygyon / and exalt wyse mē and speke oft with thē. And questyon often of doubtes with them. And de∣maunde many thynges of them. And answer wyse∣ly theyr questyōs. And honoure noble men as eche of them is worthy. n. ¶Of the pourueyaunce of a kynge. IT behoueth that a wyse kynge thynke oftē of thynges to come that he may prouyde for suche thynges as be contrary to hym. And y• he may the easiyer bere the aduersytees and contrary aduētures. And the kyng ought to be wysely hyd & refreyned / to thende that without
delyberacyon he come not to the dede that he purpo∣sed in his anger. And he ought reasonably knowlege his anger and errour / and appease hym selfe easely. For the moost souerayne wysdome and vertue that a kynge maye haue / is to rule hym selfe wysely. And whan he seeth ony thynge that is good and prouffy∣table for hym to be done / he sholde do it with grete dy¦lygēce / & dyseceeyō bycause y• people shal not say y• he hath done his besynesse folysshely / or to neglygētly. o. ¶Of the vestymentes of a kynge. IT besemeth well to y• mageste royall that y• kynge be clothed honourably. And that he shewe hymselfe alway in fayre and ryall clo∣thes. And ought in beaute of robbes to sur∣mount all other clothynge. Also he ought w grete prerogatyf & dygnyte vse fayre / deere / & straun¦ge vestures. For therby is his dygnyte more excellēt and his myght more exalted. And more reuerence is made to hym. And also it besemeth a kynge to be fay¦re spoken / with softe and kynde wordes / specyally in tyme of warre. p. ¶Of the coūtenaunce of a kynge. Swete sone Alexander it is a goodly thyng precyous / and honourable whā y• kynge speketh but lytell. But yf ouer grete nede requyre it. It is better y• ye eeres of y• peo∣ple be wyllyng to here y• wordes of a kyn¦ge / thā to be wery of his to moche spekyng. For whā
y• eeres be glutted wt the kynges speche theyr hertes be wery to se hym. And also y• kynge ought not to she we hymselfe to often to his people / nor haunt to mo∣che y• cōpany of his subgectes / & specyall of vylayns. And therfore the yndyens haue a good custome in y• ordynaunce of theyr realme. For theyr maner is that theyr kynge sheweth hymselfe but ones in the yere. And thā he is clothed in vesture royall. And all y• ba∣rōs & knyghtes of his realme bē rychely armed and arayed about hym. And he is set vpō a stede ceptr in his hande armed wt ryche armures royalles and all his people a good way before y• barōs & other no∣ble mē. And ther they shew y• dyuers perylles & aduē¦tures y• be passed. And how y• he & his coūcelles w ordred. And y• kynge as thā is wōte to pardon gre offēces to some of thē. And whā y• parlyamēt is ēded y• kynge setteth hym in a chayre & anoue yseth one of ye moost wysest mē & speketh to y• people / praysyng & cōmēdyng y• wyt & good gouernaunce of y• kynge. In yeldynge thākes to god y• hath so well ruled and mayntened ye yndyēs kynge / & y• they are pourueyed of so wyse & honourable a kyng to reygne & guyde thē And thā he cōfermeth y• sayd people in one wyl & cou∣rage to y• obedyēce of y• kynge. And thē he cōmendeth y• people & aloweth thē gretly of theyr good maners & cōdicyons which be reporteth to thē. And sheweth thē goodly wordes & exāples / y• better to put them in grace & obeysaunce / w mekenesse in the good wyll of the kynge. And whan this wyse prynce hath thus spoken / the people enforce them to exalte the pray∣synges / and commendacyons / and good maners of this sayd kynge / in prayenge god hertely for hym.
And by this meane by theyr good maners / and wys¦dome of theyr kyng they cause countrees and cytees to be obedyent to them. And thus ben the chyldren brought vp in theyr youth / & taught in the honoure and reuerence of the kynge. And the good fame of the kyng secretly and manyfestly is spredde and knowē And the ryche and poore ben thereby susteyned tho∣roughout the realme of ynde. And the kynges posses¦syons and trybures encreaseth therby. q. ¶Of the Iustyce of a kynge. A kynge ought to ordre hym soo that he do no wronge / nor harme to marchauntes / but ought to cherysshe them. For they go thoroughout all the worlde / and by them is reported the good and all renownes of fordes / & prynces. And a kynge ought by veray Iu∣styce to yelde euery man his. And so his landes and cytees shal be garnysshed with all welthes. And the kynges werkes shall multyply to his honoure and glory / and shal be the more redoubted of his foes / and shall lyue & reygne at his wyl & desyre in quyetnesse. r ¶Of the worldly desyres of a kynge. ALexander ryght worthy sone / coueyt not alwayes wordly thynges / for they be cor¦ruptyble. And thynke that thou must lea¦ue all. Demaūde than suche thynges as cannot be corrupte. That is the lyce that
cannot chaunge and the realme perdurable. And rey¦se thy thoughtes in goodnesse / and therin kepe y• strō¦ge & gloryous. And leaue the lyfe of bestes y• alwaye lyue in theyr fylthynesse. Beleue not lyghtly al thyn¦ge that is tolde to the. And be not enclyned to pardon them / agaynst whome thou hast had vyctory. And thynke on the tyme & of thynges that may happen. For thou knowest what is to come. And set not thy de¦syres in meates & drynkes / in echery / nor to moche slepe / nor in carnall desyres. r. ¶Of the chastyte of a kynge. SOuerayne Emperour enclyne not to ry of wom / for it is a swyysshe lyfe. And no glory shall be to the yf thou gouerne the after ye lyuynge of bestes without reason. Dere sone beleue me / for without doubt it chery is destruccyon of the body / the abregement corrupcyon of all vertues / the deth of a man self and maketh the man feminyne. And at the last bryngeth hym to all euylies. s. ¶Of the sportynge of a kynge. SOthly it is besemynge to a kynge to take his pastyme and sporte with his prynces and lordes. And that he haue many and dyuers maners of mynstrylles / and syn∣dry instrumētes / daūces and songes. For the humayne creature naturally anoyeth. And in su¦che instrumentes and pastymes nature desyreth / &
the body taketh force & vygoure. Than yf thou wylt delyte in suche chȳges / do it y• moost honestly & secret¦ly that thou mayst. And whā thou arte in thy pasty∣mes beware for drynkynge of wyne. And let y• other sporte thē as longe as they lust. And thā thou shalte haue many secretes dysclosed. ¶And make not this pastyme oftē / but twyse or thryse in y• yere. Also it be∣houeth y• to haue nyghe to the some of thy famylyer seruaūtes that shal tel and reporte to y• what is sayd in y• realme. And whā thou arte amonge thy barons & subgectes / honoure wyse mē & bere reuerēce to eue∣ry ma as they be worthy. And euery man in his esta¦te / mayntene & let thē ete with y• somtyme / one after another. And gyue gownes somtyme to one & somty me to another / after theyr estate / and as they be wor¦thy. And in ony wyse se y• there be none of thy knygh∣tes & famylyers / but y• he fele of thy lyberalyte & of thy grace. And thus ouerall shall appere thy largesse & gretnesse of thy courage and honour. ¶Of the dyscrecyon of a kynge. MOost worthy sone it is good that a kynge haue lyberalyte / goodly gesture / and coū¦tenaunce & that he laughe not to moche. For ouermoche laughyng causeth many to be lesse set by / and to be lesse honoured. And fynably ouermoch laughyng maketh a persone to seme older than he is. Also a kynge ought to loue his people in his courte and of his councel more than in other partyes. And yf ony do vylany to another / be ought to punysshe hym as he hath deserued / that
other may take exāple therby / and eschewe thē from yll doynge. And in y• punysshynge thou ought to re∣garde y• {per}sone y• hath done amysse. For elles sholde a hyghe & noble man be punysshed as another. And yf thou do so thou shalt not be alowed of y• people. And it is good somtyme to do rygorous & straye Iustyce / & somtyme not / to thende not y• dyfference of y• {per}sones be knowē. For it is wrytē in the boke of Machabes that a kynge ought to be praysed  loued / yf he be ly¦ke y• eygle / which hath lorshyp ouer all fowles. And not as he whiche wyll be lyke another foule y• is sub∣gecte to the eygle. Wherfore yf ony do vylany to ony other in the presence of y• kynges mageste tought to be regarded & cōsydered yf y• offence were done in ga¦me or for to cause the kyng to laugh / or to make hym or other glad of it / or yf he dyde it in despyte / & shame of the mageste royall. For y• fyrst dede he ought to be correcte / and for the seconde to suffre dethe. ¶Of the reuerence of a kynge. WOrthy kynge Alexander dere sone the obedyēce to a kynge cometh by iiij. thȳges. That is for y• vertuo{us} lyuynge of the kynge. Bycause he maketh hym to be beloued of his subgectes. Bycause he is curteys. And for the honoure and reuerence / that he dothe to them that be moost worthy of it. My dere sone do so moch that thou mayst drawe to the y• courages of thy subgectes / and auenge thē of all wronges & iniu¦tyes done to thē. And beware that thou gyue not thy subgectes cause and mater to speke agaynst th
For speche of people many tymes may do hurt Thā haue in thy mynde suche wyse that nothyng may be sayd agaynst the. And so thou shal eschue the yll wyl and dedes of thē that had yll wyll agaynst the. And forsoth the largenesse of the glory of thy dygnyte and reuerence / and exaltacyon or thy realme / and that re¦boūdeth moost to thy honoure is to haue the hertes of thy subgectes. It is founde in holy scryptures / y• the kyng is ouer a realme as the rayne is ouer y• erth which is the grace of god and blyssynge of the heuēs and cometh on the erthe / and all lyuynge creatures. For the rayne is called the way of marchaūtes / and helpe of buylders. How be it that in the rayne falleth somtyme thondre and lyghtynge? swellynge of the see and floodes with tēpestes and many other euyls cometh therby / wherwith medowes and verdures hath perysshed. For god made it so of his gree good∣nesse / benygnyte / and grace. The whiche selfe exam¦ple ye may fynde in wynter and somer. In the whi∣che the souerayne largesse gyueth and ordeyneth col¦denesse and heate / engendrynge and encreasynge of all newe thynges. How be it many euyle & perylles cometh by the rygour of grete coldnesse of wynter / & grete heates of somer. Iulyke wyse dere sone is it of a kynge. For many tymes the kynge doth many gre¦fes and euylles to his subgectes / and maketh the to beare grete herte agaynst hym. But whan the peo∣ple seeth that by the grace and good gouernaunce of y• kynge they be in peas and well ruled they forgete the aboue sayd euylles / and thāke the gloryous god that hath pourueyed them of so wyse a kynge.
¶How the kynge ought to remē∣bre his subgectes. I Requyre y• swete sone that thou of thy good∣nesse thynke and inquyre oftētymes of thy poore subgectes / and knowe theyr necessy∣tees. And set amonge them suche mē as be vertuous and that loueth god and Iustyce and that knoweth theyr maners / and vnderstādeth theyr speches / and can gouerne them peasybly and in loue. And yf thou do thus / thou shalt do the pleasu¦re of thy creatoure. And it shall be saufegarde to thy realme / and gladnesse of the and thy people. t. ¶Of the merry of a kynge. DEre sone I councell the that thou make grete prouysyō of corne and vytayles in suche wyse that thy countrees may ha∣ue haboundaunce / in eschewnge (as it chaunceth often) to haue scarcyte and fa¦myn. In so moche that by the grete prudence thou mayst saue and maynteyne thy subgectes And thou ought to haue thy garuers stuffed / and to preclayme thrughout all thy realme and cytees / how thou hast gadred and stored the of greynes and other vytayles And that thou kepest thē to the prouysyon of thy real me / and to vtter them with plente to the saluacyon of thy subgectes. The which doynge wyll cause thy people to be coragyous to do thy cōmaundementes. And so thou shalt prospere / and euery man wyll mer∣uayle of thy grete lyberalyte / & of y• prouydence afo∣re hande in thy besynesses. And they wyll repute the
as holy and lawde and magnyfye thy worthynesse. And euery man wyll feare to dysplease the. v ¶Of paynes and punysshementes. MY dere sone Alexander / I admonysshe and also praye the to kepe my doctrynes and thou shalt come to thy purpose. And thy realme shall be durable and in good estate. That is to wyte / aboue all thyn∣ge that thou kepe the frome shedynge of mannes blo∣de. For it belongeth onely to god / whiche knoweth the secretes of men. Than take not on the / the offyce that belongeth onely to almyghty god / wherfore as moche as thou mayst withdrawe thy hande thefro For the doctour Hermogenes sayth. That who that sleeth the creature lyke vnto hym / all the sterres of the skye ceaseth not to crye to the mageste of god / lor∣de / lorde thy seruaunt wyll belyke vnto the. For su∣rely god wyll take vengeaunce on hym that sleeth a man / and specyally without reasonable cause. For god answereth to the vertues of heuen saynge. Lea∣ue ye / for in me lyeth the vengeaunce / and I can yel∣de it. And wye thou that the vertues of heuē with∣out cease do present before the face of god / the dethe and blode of hym that is deed / tyll that god hath ta∣ken vengeaunce for it. u. ¶Of the knowlege of the sayd paynes.
O Moost louynge sone / of all suche paynes with the knowlege / therof wyte thou hat I haue sene moche harme / and ma∣ny euylles oftentymes come therby. Do oo that thou mayst haue in thy mynde the dedes or werkes of poetes. And thynke how they haue ly∣ued. And therby thou mayst se and lerne many good∣ly examples. And theyre thoughtes shall gyue the grete documētes in tyme comynge. And also I pray the my dere sone / that thou greue nor dysprays ∣ne lesser than thou. For it happeneth often that the small estate ryseth tyght soone in to grete rychesses and honoures / and may be so myghty that e endomage the. Many exāples therof hath ben seen as phylosophres reherse. x. ¶How a kynge ought to kepe his fayth or othe. ABoue all thynge (dere sone) beware that that thou breke not thy faythe and othe that thou hast made. For it is belongynge to strompettes / and also to people that e¦pe not / nor do not care for theyre faythe and othe. wherfore kepe thy faythe that thou hast promysed / for and yf that thou do otherwyse & wyll come to an euyll ende at the last. And yf by aduentu∣re or fortune / it chaunceth that ony welthe comth by faythe brekynge / the trust therof sholde not be good / but veray euyll & reprouable / and suche a man
is put in the nombres of them that be nought. wyte thou than that by kepynge of faythe is made y• good¦ly assemblynge of men. Cytees ben inhabyted with comyns / and  is the good sygnouryes of kynges. By kepynge of ayth castelles ben holden and kepte in lordshyps. And yf thou breke thy fayth thou shalt be reputed of euery man as a chylde or a brute beest than beware therof. And kepe also the othes / and alyaunces that thou hast made / though that they be greuous and domageable to the. Wotest thou not y• thou hast two spyrytes alwaye with the / one on the yght syde and the other on the lyft syde / whiche kno¦we and kepe all thy workes. And reporte to thy crea¦toure al that thou hast done. Of a trouth thou ought onely to asteyne y• frome all dyshonest workes. And constreye none to swere / but yf ouer grete nede re∣quyre it. A kynge ought not to swere but he be moche requyred and prayed. And yf thou wyt wyfe what was the destruccyon of Nubye / and of the assyryēs. I certyfye the that theyr kynge made othes gyleful∣ly / to deceyue the men and y ezēs next by. And bra∣ke his alyaunces and romysses that he had made / bycause they were profytable to his realme. And also to his subgectes he made many fals othes to destroy theyr next neyghboures. The ryghtwyse Iuge cou¦de susteyne nor suffre them no longer. Moost dere sone I wyll that thou knowe / that for the gouernynge and ordynaunce of thy realme I haue made the some new doctrynes / the whiche specyally is for the pro∣fyte of thyn owne famylyers and the. But as yet it is not tyme to gyue thē to the. I wll gyue the them in a certayne place of this boke shortly abreged. The
whiche yf thou kepe for thy selfe prouffytably / with the helpe of god thou shalt haue prosperyte / and that that thou desyrest. Swete sone repente y• not of thyn¦ges that be passed / for that belongeth to wom / whi∣che ben weyke of condycyon. Let thy goodnesse / thy faythfulnesse / and consyence be all hooe / and many∣fest. And they shall be saufegarde o thy realme and destruccyon of thyn enemyes. y. ¶Of studye. TAke hede that thou haue studyes and ¦les in thy cytees. And cause all hy people to lerne theyr chyldren lettres and scyences / and vse them to studye. For ought to helpe and socoure the gouern le of studyens and poore scolers. And gyue auaunta∣ges and prerogatyues to good studyentes that pe¦fyte to theyr lernynge / and this wyse thou shalt grue an exāple to thē that be laye / exalte theyr prayers and receyue theyr wrytynge mekely / prayse them y• ought to be worshypped. Gyue thy goodes to them that be worthy. Cherysshe clerkes and styre them to prayse the. And put the and thy werkes in goodly wrytynges / which by them shalbe {per}petually pray∣sed. z. ¶How a kynge ought to kepe his body. MOost beloued sone kynge Alexandre / trust ot in women / nor in theyr werkes / nor seruyces / and company not with them.
And yf necessyte were that thou must haue cōpany of a woman. o so that thou mayst knowe that she is true to the / and holsome of her bodye. For whan thy persone is betwene the armes of a woman / thou arte as a Iew / put / and restynge in the handes of a marchau at careth not to whome it is ol∣de. And beynge betwene her handes / is the poyson of thy welfare / and also the destruccyon of thy body. Beware therfore dere sone / of suche wmen / for they be venymous and deedly. For it is no newe thynge to knowe that by theyr venym many mē haue dyed. Thou knowest well that many kynges haue forhe∣red and shortened theyr lyues and haue dyed by poy¦son. Also dere sone Alexander beware that thou put not thy trust in one physycyen onely. For one physy∣cyen maye hurte the / and shorely do to the mothe harme And therfore yt thou mayst / do so that thou haue many physycyēs. And that they be of one agre∣ment. And yf thou wylt haue ony medycyn / take it not but by the councell of them all. And that they be such as knoweth the qualyte and nature of the thyn¦ges that ben put / and necessary in the medycyne. And that it be of a certayne weyght and measure / as the medycyne requyreth it. For by equall porcyōs of weyght and measure the arte of physyke is com∣pownded. ¶And thynke on dere sone that whan thou was in the parties ofynde / many people ma∣de to the grete presentes and fayre. Amonge the whi¦che was snte a fayre mayden whiche in her chyld∣heed had be nourysshed with venym of serpentes / wherby her nature was conuerted in to the nature of serpentes. And than yf I had not wysely beholden
her and by my artes and wyt knowen her / bycau∣se that cōtynually / and without shamefastnesse euer she loked in the faces of the people / I perceyued that with ones bytynge she wolde haue put a mā to deth as sythen thou hast seen the experyence before he. And yf I had not knowen her nature / at the fyrst ty¦me that thou had medled with the sayd myde thou haddest ben deed without remedy. Fayre sone kepe thy noble soule / whiche is gyuen to the and ent fro the company of aungelles the whiche is takē to the of god for to kepe. Not that thou soyle & arre it but y• it be put amonge the wyse & gloryfyed spyrys. & ¶Of the dyfference of astronomy. ALexander fayre sone / I praye the / that yf thou mayt do it / that thou rye nor eate / nor drynke / nor do ony other thȳ¦ge / but by the councell of some that kno∣weth and hath the scȳce in knowlegy ∣ge the sterres and astronomye. And thou shalte wy∣te my dere sone that almyghty god hath made no∣thynge without cause / but hath done euery thynge reasonably. And by certayne scyences and wayes / the wyse phylozopher Platon sought and felte the operacyons of all thynges composed of the foure ele∣mentes / and the humoures contraryes. And hadde also the knowlege of the thynges created and formed And also my dere sone Alexander I praye the beleue not such fooles which say y• y• scyēce of y• plas is so harde to be knowē / & that none maye come therto. Surely they be fooles and woe not what they say.
It is a noble thyng to knowe thynges whiche be to come. yf thou knowest the thynges whiche be to co∣me / thou and other {per}sones may put remedy by good prayers. And requyre the creatoure that hath ordey∣ned them to retourne theyr malyce / & ordeyne them otherwyse. Thynke not dere sone that god hath or∣deyned & predestynate such thynges / but that by his power he may chaunge them otherwyse whan he pleaseth. Wyte thou dere sone y• y• good people pray to our creatoure wt orysons & deuout petycyons / by fa∣stynge & sacrefyces / by almesse & other maner / axyng of pardon of theyr synnes / & doynge penaunce / y• our lorde may retorne & remēbre suche predestynacyons whiche other do feare so moche. ¶Retorne we dere sone to our fyrst purpose / wyte thou y• astronomye is deuyed in .iiii. {per}tes. That is to wyte in ordynaunce ofsterres. In y• dysposycyon of sygnes / & of theyr elon¦gacyons. Of the moeuynge of the son̄e. And this par¦tye is called scyence of astronomy: The other parte is of y• knowlege of the moeuynge of the skyes & of the mone. And this partye is called astronomy. And is y• worthyest / of sterres / planettes / & sygnes. And there is .M.xxviii. planettes sygned / and formed / of y• whi¦che we shall speke more playnly. {con}. ¶Of the gouernayle of helth. HElthe amonge all thynges is to be gotē and hath more than ony myght of ry∣chesses. For y• kepyng of helth is by vsyn¦ge of equal thynges comoyned to the bo¦dy / as by attemperaunce of humoures.
For the gloryous god hath ordeyned thē / and gyuen dyuers remedyes to the attemperaūce of the humou¦res to the kepyng of helth. And hath shewed it to his holy men and prophetes / & to many other Iust men whiche he dyde chuse and enumyned with the holy goost / in his sapyence dyuyne / and myghty. And hath gyuen them the gyftes of the scyence / of these thynges here after folowynge. These phylosophers put the begynnyng of it. That is to wyte they of yu∣de / of Grece / and of Athenes. whiche phylosophres were Iust and perfyte / and theyr wrytynges were the begȳnynge of scyēce & secretes. For in theyr wy tynges is nothynge founde to be reproued nor  / but approued of all wye men. {rum}. ¶Of the gouernayle of seke people. ALl wyse and naturall phylosophres say y• man is made and composed of foure con∣trary humours / the which haue alway nede to be susteyned with meate and drȳ¦ke The substaunce wherof beheueth to yssue and be corrupte yf ony do alway cae and dryn∣ke / and he sholde waxe weyke and fall in grete dysea¦ses / and haue many inconuenyences. But yf he eate and drynke tēperatly and reasonably / he shall fynde helpe of lyfe / strength of body / and helth of all the mē¦bres. The wyse phylosophres saye that yf any man respace the god of nature / and the good maner of ly¦uynge be it in to moche eatynge and drynkynge / or to moche slepynge / or wakynge / in to moche walkȳg or restynge / beynge to laxatyfe or to moche let ynge
of blode or to lytell / it can not be but he must fall in ma¦ny dyseases / and greues. Of the whiche dyseases I haue bryefly founde / and therin wyll I shewe the my councell / & remedye for the same. All wyse phylo∣sophres accordeth in one sayeng. who so kepeth hym fro ouermoche eatynge & drynkyng / & frome y• exces∣ses aforesayd & kepeth temperaūce / he shal be helth∣full of his bodye / & lyue longe. For I can fynde no mā but he is of this opynyon / & wyll saye y• all delectable thynges of the worlde / be it in pleasure of y• body / it is but for to lyue y• longer in them. But for a more se∣crete ye ought to enforce you to do suche thynges as ben belongynge to longe lyfe / & not to folowe the ap∣petyte / y• is to wyte / not to put lye meate vpō meat. And dere sone I haue herde often spoken of ypocras which kept many tymes dyete to thēde y• he myght lyue & endure the longer. Not for to lyue and endure for y• meate & drynke. Also dere sone it is grete holsom∣nesse to be purged of superfluytees & euyll humours whiche ben in y• body. A. ¶In how many maners a man may kepe his helthe. GOod sone I praye the haue in thy mynde stedfastly these certayne instruceyōs and kepe thē. Knowe thou that helth is chyef¦ly in two thynges. The fyrst is lete a mā vse suche meates & drynkes as he hath bē nourysshed with. The seconde that he purge hym of yll humours that be corrupte & greue hym. For ye bo∣dy of man is fedde wt meates & drynkes whiche nou¦rysshe
it by naturall heate that dryeth / nouryssheth and fedeth ye moystnesse therof. B. ¶Of dyuers meates for ye stomake. WHā ye body is fat & full of vapours grosse meates is good for it. & of ye nourysshȳg of suche a body / ye dygestyō is grosse / & of grece quātyte for ye great heate / & va∣pours of ye body. And whā the bodye is sklneder & drye / subtyll & moyste meates be good for it. And ye dygestiō therof is of smal quātyte for ye streyt¦nesses of ye cōduytes. And it is grete wysdome & scyen¦ce for a man to vse suche meates as ben good & apper∣tenēt to his cōplex yō / that is to wyte yf he fede hym wt hote meates tēperatly. But yf the heare be to gre∣uous & brēnynge wtin the body by ouer stronge wy∣nes & hote meates / or other accydentes / thā cōtrary meates & drynkes wyl do grete ease & prouffyte yt is to wyte suche as ben colde. ¶Of the stomake. ¶Yf thy stomake be to hote thā hote & cours meates be good. For such a stomake is lyke a myghty fyre for to brēne gret weyght of logges. But whā ye stomake is colde & feble thā it is good to haue lyght & subtyle meates. ¶The sygnes to knowlege ye stomake. ¶The sygnes of a stomake yt is of an yll & weyke dy¦gestyō is whā ye body is vnlusty / heuy / & slouthful / ye face is swollē / & he yaneth oftē / & hath payne in his eyē / & bolketh often & rudely / & ye bolkyng is lowre & vnsauery / watry & stynkīg / & therby is bredde wyn¦des & swellynge of the bely & ye appetyte of mea is marde. Therfore swete sone beware of meates and drynkes yt may hurte or be contrary to thy helth.
C. ¶An epystle of grete value. MOost dere sone Alexāder sythe it is so that the body of man is corruptyble by dyuer∣syte of cōplexyon / & of contrary humours that ben in it / wherby oftē there cometh corrupcyō to it / I thought to delyuer the some thyng y• shall be necessary & prouffytable to the. In the whiche I wyll treate of the secretes of physy¦ke whiche shall please the. For certayne dyseases co∣me to a kynge whiche be not honest to shewe to phy∣sycyens. And yf thou wylt obserue this lesson / thou shalt haue no nede of physycyens / except in causes y• may come in batayle / the whiche may be exchewed. Alexander fayre sone / whan thou rysest frome thy sle¦pe / walke and stretche thy membres egally and com¦be thy heed / for stretchyng of the lymmes gyueth for∣ce / and combynge reyseth the vapoures that ben co∣me in slepynge and putteth them frome the stomake In somer wasshe thy heed in colde water / whiche shall yelde the naturall heate / and shall because of ap¦petyte to meate. Than clothe the with goodly and ry¦che apparell. For the hert of man delyteth in the be∣holdyng of precyous meates & clothȳg. Than rubbe thy tethe with some cours lynnyn / or other thynge that is note and drye of cōplexcyon / and swete of smell for it is holsom for the tethe / and kepeth them clene / clenseth the stenche of the mouth / and clereth the voy¦ce / and gyueth appetyte to eare. And rubbe thy heed often in the same wyse for it openeth the claustres of the brayne / and thycketh the necke and other mem∣bres / and clenseth the face and the syght / and prolon∣geth stowpynge of aege / and amendeth the blode.
Also anoynt the somtyme with swete smellynge oyn¦tementes / as the tyme requyreth / for in suche swete∣nesse thy hert taketh grete pleasure / & is nourysshed therby. And ye spyryt of lyfe taketh refeccyon in good odoures: and the blode reneth meryly thrugh y• vay∣nes of the body. After that take somtyme an electua∣ry of a wood called Aloes / and of Bubarbe whiche is a precyous thynge / to the pryce of foure pens. Which thou shalte fynde wryten in the boke of physyke / and this shall do the moche good / for it voydeth the heate of the mouth of the stomake / and warmeth the body and wasteth wyndes / and maketh good taste and sa∣uoure. After this I coūcell y• that thou be often with thy noble and wyse men of thy realme / & speke to the of thy besynesses that thou hast to do. And gouerne them sadly accordynge to theyr good customes. D. ¶Of the maner to trauayle. OR euer thou eate or thyn appetyte co∣meth at thyn houre accustomed do som trauayle / that is to wyte walke or ty∣de a lytell / or do some other worke / for it helpeth y• body moche / it voydeth all ventosytees / and maketh the body lyghter stronger and lustyeth the stomake / and wasted euyll humou∣res of the body and maketh the flewme or the stoma¦ke descende. ¶Of the maner of eatynge. ¶Fayre sone whā thy meate is set afore the / eate of suche as thou desyrest moost / resonably / with well leuayned breed. And eate of such as ought to be fyrst eaten. For there be two maners of dygestyō of meat
in a man that is to wyte / softe / & harde. For in the bo¦tō is moost heat for to make meat / bycause it is moost flesshly / and nyghest the heat of the lyuer wherwith the meate is soden and dygested. E. ¶Of abstynence of meat. WHā thou eatest / eate by leasure / though thou haue grete appetyte to eate. For yf thou eate gredely noughty humou∣res do multyply / the stomake is laden the bodye is greued / the hert is hurte / and the meate remayneth in the stomakes botome vndygested. F. ¶How pure water ought not to be dronkē. ALso beware dere sone that ye drynke no pure water / specyally whan thou haste eaten meate. But yf thou be wont ther∣to. For as soone as the water is vpon the meat / it coleth y• stomake / and quencheth the heate of the dygest you and comforte of the meat. It letteth dygestyon and greueth the body. Yf thou must nede drynke water alone / take it the moost tem¦peratly and as lytell as thou mayst. G. ¶Of the maner to slepe. WHan thou hast taken thy refeccyon and hast iuste to slepe / lye downe on a softe bedde and slepe temperatly. Aud fyrst lye downe on the lyfte syde / and slepe theron a reasonable space / for the lyfte syde is colde and hath nede to be warmeth. And yf thou fele ony payn in thy bely or in thy stomake / thā
lay therto a souerayne medytyne / that is a warme lynnen cloth layde theron. Wyte yu dere sone that tra∣uayle is good / and gyueth heate to the stomake. But after dyner it is a noughty thynge / for the meat aby∣deth vndygested in the botome of the stomake / and therof be bredde many dyseases. And slepe before fe∣dynge is not good / for it maketh the body leaue and dryeth the humoures. But slepynge after fedynge is good / for it fulfylleth y• body & gyueth force / & no yf shyng therto. For whā y• body of mā resteth / thā y• na¦tural heat draweth y• heat yt was spredde in all y• mē¦bres in to y• botō of y• stomake / & gyueth strēgth ther∣to vpō y• refeccyō of y• meat. And heat requyreth rest. Therfore some phylosophres haue sayd y• it is better & holsomer to eat at nyght than in the mornyng / for the eatyng in y• mornynge bycause of y• heat of y• day greueth y• stomake / & y• body is more trauayled ther∣wt. And moreouer y• {per}sone chauffeth ī trauaylyng do∣ynge his besynesse / in goyng & spekȳg / & many other thȳges y• belōgeth to y• body of mā / by y• which heat y• is outwarde towarde none / ye naturall heat y• is in warde is weyked & appeyred / & y• meate is harde to dygest. But at nyght it is more easy & lesse greued wt y• heat of traueyle. And y• hert & mēbres of mā bē more in quyet by y• coldnesse of ye nyght / that gyueth natu¦rall heat to the stomake. H. ¶The kepyng of custome or wont. THou shalt vnderstande my dere sone that he that is wonte to eate but one meale of∣tē is dyseased / for y• stomake is wtout dyge¦styō & ye body hath  nourysshȳg. And he y• is acustomed to eate at one time os
another tyme twyse he shallyghtly perceyue that it doth hym harme / for custome chargeth nature. I. ¶How one ought to chaunge custome ANd yf nede constreyne the to chaūge thy custome / do it wysely / that is to wyte by lytel and lytell. And so by the grace of god thy chaungynge shall be good. But abo∣ue al thynges beware that thou eate not tyl thou rele thy stomake empty and that it hath ma¦de good dygest yon of the fyrst meale. And this thou mayst knowe by y• desyre that thou shalt haue to thy meate: and by thy spae that tornyth subtylly in thy mouthe. And yf thou eate without nede or appetyte the heate of thy stomake shall be made colde as yse. And yf necessyte be y• thou must eate / & haue an appe¦tyte therto y• kynde heate of thy stomake wyll be as hote as fyre / & of good dygest yō. And beware y• whā thy appetyte cometh that thou eate not forth wt / for it wyll gadre yll humours of thy body in to thy stoma∣ke / whiche wyll hurte thy brayne. And yf thou tary ouer lōge or thou eate / it wyl feble thy stomake / & the meate wyll do thy body no good. And yf so be y• thou mayst not eate as soone as thy appetyte requyreth / and y• thy stomake be ful of yll humours / do so y• thou mayst vomyte or thou ae / & after y• vomyte take an lectuary / and eate surely. K. ¶Of the foure seasons of the yere.
OUr intencyon is to treat in this boke of y• foure seasons of the yere / with the qualy¦te / propryete / contraryte / and dyfferen∣ce of eche of them. And they ben certayne seasons of the yere deuyded as foloweth. That is to wyte prymtyme or vere begynneth whan the sonne eurreth in the sygne or Artes / and lasteth foure score & xiij. dayes / and .xviij. houres / & the fourthe parte of an houre. That is to wyte frome y• .x. day in y• ende of Marche / to y• foure and twenty day of Iune. And in this season the dayes & nyghtes beneg all of length The wether is fayre. The warme wether cometh. The snowes melte / ryuers renne swyft and clere / & waxe warme / the moystnesse of the erthe ryseth to y• heyght of trees / and causeth them to smel swete. Me¦dowes and graynes sprowte and corne groweth / & all floures take coloure / byrdes bn clothed with ne∣we robes / and enforce them to synge. Trees ben dec∣ked with leues and floures / and the landes with se∣des. Beestes engendre and all people take strength & lust. The erthe is arayed goodly / & is as a fayre bry∣de clothed with Iewelles of dyuers coloures bycau¦se she sholde seme the fayrer at her weddynge. L. ¶Of prymtyme / and what it is. THe prymtyme is hote & moyst temperatly as the ayre. This season y• blode moeueth and spredeth to all the membres of the bo∣dy / and the body is parfyte in temperate complexyon. In this season chekyns / kyd¦des / and peched gges ought to he eaten / with letu∣ses
& gotes mylke in these thre monethes. Prymety∣me begynneth whan the sonne entreth the sygne of Aryes and lasteth .xci. dayes / an houre and a halfe fro the .x. day of Marche to y• .x. day of Iune. In this season is the best letyng of blode of ony tyme. And thā is good to trauayle and to be laxatyfe. And to be ba∣thed. And to eate suche thynges as wyll purge y• be¦ly. For all dyseases that cometh / eyther by purgyng or bledynge retorneth anone in this prymetyme. M. ¶Of somer and what it is. SOmer begynneth whā the sonne entreth y• fyrst poynt of the creuyce / & lasteth .xcii. days / & an houre & a half That is to wyte fro y• .x. day of Iune to ye .x. day of septēber In this seasō y• days belōge & y• nyghtes short. And ī al regyōs ēcreaseth & abateth theyr heate & y• see is calme / & y• ayre meke & fayre. The fours wy¦ther & serpētes encrease & shed theyr venym / & sprede theyr strēgth. The myghtes of mānes body be forty∣fyed. And all ye world is ful of welth / as y• fayre bryde y• is goodly stature & in {per}fyte aege. The seasō of somer hote & drye / & thā coler is moeued. And ī this seas is good to beware of all thȳges y• be hote & drye of cōple xyō. And take hede of to moche eatyng or drynkynge for therby is y• kyndly heate quenched. In this seasō eate meates of colde & moyst cōplexyō / as veale / myl¦kew vyneygre / & potages made wt barly meale. Ea∣te fruyt of eygre sauour / as pōmegarnets / & drynke small wynes / & vse not the cōpany of womē. In this season lete the not blode / but yf grete nede cōpell the. Use lytell trauayle / & seldome bathynge. N. ¶Of Autumpne / or heruest.
HEruest entreth whā y• sonne cometh in to y• fyrst degre of the balaunce & lasteth xci. dayes & an houre & a halfe. That is to wyte fro the .x. daye of Septēbre to ye x. daye of Decembre. In this season the day & nyght be of one length. And thā y• dayes waxe short & y• nyghtes longe. The ayre is derke & y• wyn∣des entre the northen regyons or pētryō. The we∣ther chaūgeth / & y• ryuers & sprges waxe le. The orcheyardes & feuytes wydreth. The beaute of erhe fadeth. Byrdes cease theyr syngyng. Serpētes seke theyr holes wher they assembled theyr syuyng in so¦mer for y• tyme of wynter. The erthe is as an ode na¦ked woman y• gooth fro youth to aege. This season of heruest is colde & drye / this tyme blacke coler is mo∣ued. In this seasō is good to eate meates ye be hote moyst as chekȳs / lambe / & drynke olde wynes / eate swete reasyns. And kepe ye from all thynges y• bde blacke coler / as lyenge wt womē more than in somer / nor bath ye not but yf grete nede requyre it to be done. In this season yf a man haue nede of vomytynge / do it at none in the hotest of y• day. For at y• tyme a y• su{per}∣fluytees of mannes body gadreth togyder A o is good to purge y• bely wt a medyeyn ordeyned therfore & other thȳges y• bē to expule blacke coler & to retray¦ne humoures. O. ¶Of wynter and what it is. Wynter cometh whā y• on̄e ētreth y• fyrst degre of y• sygne of Caprycorne & lasteth lxx. dayes / & an houre & a halfe. And be gȳneth y• .x. day of Decembre / and cōty¦nueth to y• .x. daye of Marche. In this
seasō y• nyghtes be lōge & y• days short / it is veray col¦de. The wynes be in y• presse / & y• leues fall / & herbes leeseth all theyr strength / or the moost parte. All be∣stes hydeth them in caues and pyttes of hylles. The ayre and the wether is darke. And the erthe is lyke an olde decrypyte persone / that by grete aege is na∣ked and nygh to the deth. wynter is veray colde and moyst / & than behoueth the vse hote meates as che∣kyns / hennes / motton and other hote & fatte flesshe eate fygges / nuttes / and drynke grene wynes. And beware of to moche lare and bledynge / & eschewe cō∣pany of women / for it wyll feble thy stomake / and ba¦ches be good. And for the grete colde the natural hea¦te entreth in to the body / and therfore the dygestiō is better in wynter thā in somer. And in heruest the be¦ly is colde / and than the poores ben open by heate of the season / and reproueth the naturall heate of all the partes of y• body. And therfore the stomake hath but lytel heate / wherby the dygestyon is febled / and the humours assemble there. P. ¶Of naturall heate. SOne Alexāder I pray y• kepe the kyndly heate of thy body / and thou shalt haue sō¦ge helth. For the body of man dyeth in .ij. maners. One is by grete aege the which ouercometh the body and dystroyeth it. The other is accydentally / as by wepen / sykenesse. or other aduenture. Q. ¶Of thynges that fatteth the body.
Ryght dere sone these ben thynges that fat∣teth the body. That is to wyte ease of the body and fyllynge it wt deynty meates and drynkes / & mylke / and thā to slepe on a soft bed. All swete smellynge floures in theyr season / and bathynge in fresshe waters. But yf thou bathe the / tary not longe in it / and haue swete ne∣lynge thȳges in y• bath. And neuer drynke wyne but it be well tempered wt water. And specyally in wyn∣ter make water of floures calleb Assynn and put it in to thy wyne / for it is hote or nature. And in somer vse vyolettes and floures of malowes & other thyn∣ges that be colde / & vse to vomyte ones in a moneth specyally. For vomytes wassheth the body and pur∣geth it of wycked humoures and stnke that is in it. And yf there be but few humoures in the stomake / it conforteth the naurall heate. And whan thou hast vomyte wyllyngly / the body wyll fyll it with good humydyte and be of good dyspoycyon to dygest. And yf thou gouerne the thus / thou shalt be mery at thy hert / lusty with reasonable helth and good vnderstā¦dyng / glory & honour / & ouer al thyn enemyes vycto¦ry. Also I wyll that thou delyte in the beholdyng o goodly persones / or in redynge of delectable bokes or in weryng of precyous garmētes and goodly Ie∣welles / as the tyme requyreth. R. ¶Of thynges that leaneth the body. THese ben the thynges that maketh the body to be leane / weyke / and drye / to moche eatyn¦ge / to moche trauelynge to moche walkynge in the
son̄e / to moche goyng / to moche slepyng afore noone melancoly / feare / to bathe in water of the nature of brymstone / eatynge salt meates / to moche drynkyn∣ge of olde wyne / to be to laxe / and ouer moche letynge of blode. For ypocras sayth that he yt batheth him wt a full bely / or lyeth with a womā shal haue sykenesse in his entrayles. And also to rēne / or to ryde / or to mo¦che trauayle after meat bredeth a grete dysease cal∣led palsey. And moche eatyng of fysshe / or mylke and wyne togyder ypocras sayth it wyl make one lazar S. ¶Of the fyrst parte of the body. OF ye .iiij. partes of ye body the heed is ye fyrst. For in ye heed gadreth all su{per}fluytees / and euyll hu¦moures / whiche thou shalt fele and knowe by these sygnes folowyng. The eyes bē troubled / the heryng is thycked & ys nosestrylles bē stopped / yf thou fele su¦che a dysease take an herbe called worm wood / and se¦the it in swete wyne tyll the halfe be wasted / thā hol¦de it in thy mouth & wasshe it many tymes therwith tyl thou fele yt it dooth ye good / & eate whyte mustard sede powdred wt thy meate. And yf thou do not thus thou mayst happē to haue som dysease / & specyally in thyn eyes / in thy brayn / & in other {per}tes of thy body. T. ¶Of the seconde parte of the body. THe seconde parte of the body is the bulke / yf dysease come there thou shalt knowe it by these sygnes folowynge The tōgue is lette / ye mouthe is salt / bytter / & vnsauery The mouth of the stomake is sowre with
grefe in all thy mēbres. It behoueth y• to eate but ly∣tel & to vomyte / thā eate a lytel sugre of roses wt aloes & take good cōfortyng spyces & eate an elecuary na∣med Dionisiū. And yf thou do not th{us} / thou mayst fal in dysease of y• syde / of y• raynes / & feuers / & specyally of y• tōgue wherby y• shalt not {pro}perly speke / & dyuers other maladyes. Decoccyon of ysope is good. U. ¶Of the thyrde parte of the body. THe thyrde parte of the body is the wōbe / yf it be cōbred wt euyll humoures y• shalt knowe it by these sygnes. The bely wyll swell wt payne & styf∣nesse in ye knees goynge a slowe pae. It behoueth to vse some subtyle & lyght meates / as is sayd before wt the gouernynge. And yf y• do not thus there wyl folo we ache in the hyppes / in the mylte / in the back and other ioyntes / and in the lyuer / wyll dygest yon. X ¶Of the fourth parte of the body. THe fourth {per}te of the body bē y• genytours. yf su¦per fluyte & noughty humoures gadre in thē y• shalt knowe it by these sygnes. The appetyte wyl waxe colde / & reednesse wyll appere vpō thē & vpō y• share. Thā must y• take a sede called Apu wt fenell sede & ye rote of mugwort / & of another called Achā & atra¦cies. And wt these herbes put y• rotes in good whyte wyne / & drȳke a quātyte of it euery mornyng wt a ly∣tell water & hony & eate not moche after it. And yf y• do not th{us} y• shalt haue payne in y• bladder / & lyu  & shalte not pysse / & shalt haue grefe in y• intra s and lunges with brekynge of the stone. Swete sone Ale¦xander I haue rede also the hystoryes of a myghty kynge / whiche assembled all the best phylosophres
that were in ynde and Grece. And cōmaunded them to make a medyeyne so prouffytable that he sholde ne¦de none other for his helth. The Grekes sayd he that drynketh euery mornȳg twyse his mouthfull of war¦me water shall haue a good ende / and shall nede none other medyeyne. The physycyens of ynde sayd thar it is good to eate euery day astyng a quātyte of grey¦nes of whyte hony. And me semeth that who so ta∣keth one of these sayd medycynes / by reason shall not haue payne in his wombe / nor ought not to feare pal¦sey / nor gowte / nor ahe in his Ioyntes. And who o eateth euery mornynge .vij. oragmas of clustres of swete wyne grapes / shall not feare y• dysease of flew me / and it wyll amende his mynde / and claryfy his vnderstandynge / and he nedeth not to to doubt feuer uartaynes. And who so eateth inthe mornynge a fygge with nuttes and a quantyte of leues ofrue / y• ay shall not nede to feare venym. ¶Of naturall heate. ¶Moost myghty kynge I requyre the to study the maner to kepe the naturall heat of thy body / with ye moysture therof / in the whiche two thynges lyeth the helthe of thy persone. And knowe thou that the destruccyon of the body cometh in two thynges / one is naturall / and the other agaynst nature. And for ye contraryte of the complexyon of man / and whan ae∣ge surmounteth y• body it behoueth for to dye. Other wyse vnnaturally by aduēture / as by wepen / or sto∣nes / or by sykenesse and lacke of helpe / or by venym / and other chaunces. ¶Of the qualytees of meates. ¶Forthermore it is good that thou knowe the natu¦re
of meates / for some bē grosse / or cours / & some ben lyght & subtyle. The subtyle bredeth thyn̄e blode / & good / as pure wheate / chekyns / & new layde egges Grosse meates ben good for suche as ben of hote hu∣mours / labourers / fastyng / and y• slepe after meales. Meane meates bredeth no hote nor superfluous hu∣mours / as the flesshe of lambes / yōge porke / & other that bē hote and moyste / but suche meates chaunge often in rostynge to hardnesse / to heate / and dryenesse And they ought to be eaten forth with after the rostȳ¦ge / and ben good yf they be so taken wt good spyces. Some meates brede melancoly / as befe / cowes fles∣she / and all flesshe that is cours and drye Other that brede and fede in moyst and warry / & shadowy pla∣ces ben more subtyle / better and holsomest. Y. ¶Of the nature of fysshe. Fysshes that ben of small substan̄ce / & thynne skynnes / asy of eatynge / bredde in rennyn¦ge waters nyghe the see bē better & lyghter than they that bredde in y• see or fresshe ry∣ners. But fysshe that bredeth in y• see is holsomer thā fresshe ryuer fysshe. Therfore beware of fysshe of gre∣te substaunce wt harde skynnes for suche bē comynly venemous. A. ¶Of the nature of waters. THou ought to knowe y• clere rēnynge waters that ben nyghe to cytees in pure grounde as small brokes be the best and lyghtest. water that co∣meth
out of stony erthe where as is moche fumosy∣tees is heuy / cōtagyous / & noysom. water of puddles or fenne full of frogges / addres / and other venymous wormes be vnholsom. The sygnes of good water is to be clere / lyght / & of good colour / yt lyghtly dooth se the and lyghtly coole. In suche waters nature dely¦teth salt. water of ye see is fumysshe and laxeth y• wō∣be / & water of ye see is hote and heuy bycause it moe∣ueth not / & the sonne is dayly ouer it / and it bredeth coler / and creaseth the mylt and the sunges. The drȳ¦kynge of waters with a colde stomake fastynge afo∣re dyner greueth the body / and quencheth the heate of the stomake. But drynkynge of water after dyner warmeth the stomake and bredeth flewme. And mo¦che of it corrupteth the meate in the stomake. Thou oughtest to drynke colde water in somer and warme water in wynter / and not cōtrary wyse. For warme water in somer molly fyeth and weyketh the stoma∣ke / and wasteth the appetyte. And in wynter colde water quēcheth the heate / and destroyeth the instru¦mentes of the brest / it noyeth the lyghtes and lūges and bredeth many greues. B. ¶Of the nature of wyne. THe nature of wyne that groweth on moū¦taynes nygh to y• sonne is dryer thā that / that groweth on the playne grounde / in moyst places / & shadowes wyne is good for aeged people / and suche as be moyst & slewmy. And enoyeth them that be yonge and hote. And wyne warmeth & delyuereth colde and cours
superfluytees. The reeder and thycker that wyne is the more it bredeth blode. But yf it be strōge and byt¦ter / thā it is called the fyrst blode and the fyrst nourys¦shyng / and hath the nature of drynke and medycyne And often droukē it noyeth the body and nouryssheth it not. And whā wyne is naturally swete / it noyeth the stomake with smellynges and wyndes but such wyne is comynly swete of cōplexyon / and suche as groweth in large feeldes stretchynge towarde the mountaynes and valees hauynge swete clustres / & rype / and be not gathred tyll the myght of the sub∣staunce of the bery is gone with the moystnesse / and y• the vyne and the grape be somwhat wydred. And thou shalt knowe that wyne ought to be of an eygte taste sharpe and pleasaunt / and haue thyeke lyes on the botome of the vessell / and fayre and clere aboue / & whan thou hast fayre and good wyne drynke tempe¦ratly therof to ye ease of thy body / as the tyme requy∣reth. For it strēgtheth the stomake and the heates of y• body / and helpeth dygestyon and kepeth frome cor¦rupcyon / and typeth the meate in the membres / pu∣ryfyeng it / & worketh in thē tyll it be cōiunt in good blode / & nourysshynge / and trauayleth & reyseth the heat of the body temperately. And kepeth a man sure of wycked humours / it gladdeth the hert / & maketh fresshe colour in the face. It uyckeneth the mynde & soupleth the tōgue / & destroyeth all melancoly / & ma∣ke a man bolde / & to haue good courage & appetyte. And hath many other good propryetees. But yf wy¦ne be outrageously takē many inconuenyences come therby. It troubleth ye brayne / ye mynde / yt wyttes / ye vnderstondynge. It maketh the vertue of natural
eate wylde / & causeth forgetfulnesse. It cōbreth the ōgue & weyketh all y• synewes & lymmes of ye body. It maketh the eyes reed & blered. It chaūgeth ye co∣lour / & destroyeth ye body / & maketh cours & noughty blode. It marreth dygestyon. It causeth to many wordes / & to moche slepe. It maketh ye mouthe styn∣kynge. It letteth ye goynge / & dystroyeth y• sede of mā & bredeth lepry. Beware therfore yt thou drynke not wyne outrageously / but moeue & chaunge ye nature therof wt rewbarbe whiche causeth ye lyuer to lyue. And wyne wt Rubarbe hath many vertues as is foū¦de playnly in bokes of physyke. Howbeit Rubarbe & wyne be bothe deedly ven yf they be outragyously takē. And surely all euyls cometh of wyne vnmeasu¦rably dronken. C. ¶Of goodnesse & harme yt cometh of wyne. NOble kynge Alexāder / forgete not to ta∣ke tarte syropes in ye mornyng fastynge whan flewmatyke humours haboūde to moch. For it is proufytable & wasteth thē moche. Also I meruayle y• ony man may dye or be seke that eateth breed of clene and good wheat / holsome & good flesshe / & drynketh good wy∣ne of grapes tem{per}atly. And yf he kepe hym fro to mo∣che drynkyng / eatyng & trauayle. yf sykenesse ouer come such a man he must be healed as a dronkē man. That is to wyte he must be wasshed wt warme wa∣ter / and thā set ouer a rēnyng water betwene .ii. gre¦ne wylowes / & his stomake anoynted wt an oȳtemēt of sandres / or sandalles / & haue a fumy gacyō of frākē¦sēce: & other swete spyces / & it wyl do hym moch good And yf ony mā wyll forsake holly ye drynkyng of wy¦ne
/ he ought not to leaue it sodeynly at ones but lytel & lytell / & to mēgle it euery day wt water more & mo∣ve / tyll at the last there be nothynge but clere water. And so he may kepe his helth & good cōplexyon. Th{us} gouerne thy body yf thou wyll lyue longe. And kepe my doctrynes / & consydre these thynges folowynge wherin nature conforteth gretely. That is to wyte. Goodly pastymes / syght of grete rychesses / grete e∣uerence / vyctory ouer enemyes / fedyng on good mea¦tes / noyse of mynstralsy / syght of precyous garmen∣tes / often herynge of good tydynges / speche or wyse men to enquere of thynges past and to come / and cō¦munycacyon with fayre gentyl women. D. ¶Of the fourme of Iustyce. O Moost dyscrete kynge Iustyce cā not be praysed to moche / for it is of meruaylous sharpe nature / lyke to the moost gloryo{us} god. And he ordeyned it ouer his aūgels ouer his werkes / & ouer al realmes. And thou ought to kepe Iustyce / and defende the wyttes / the ryches∣ses / & possessyons of thy subgectes and all theyr wer∣kes / for so dooth almyghty god. And ony lorde doyng in lyke case is lyke to god. For by maynteyrg of Iu¦styce he foloweth god / and thou ought to folow hym in all nedefull werkes. And this is the fourme of vn∣derstandynge the whiche god created / and graun∣ted to his creatures. By Iustyce the erche was ma∣de / and kynges ordeyned to kepe and maynteyne Iu∣styce for it maketh subgectes meke and obedyent / prowde men lowly / and kepeth all persones in saufe fro wronges and domages. And therfore they of yn∣de saye that the Iustyce of a good lorde is better to
good subgectes than the plentyousnesse of the erthe. And also they say that the Iust and reasonable lorde is better thā the rayne that falleth in the euenyng. And there was ones founde wryten in a stone in the speche of Caldee that wyse kynges ben bretheren ha¦uyyge nede eche of other / and one maye not be with∣out the other. For all the kynges of the worlde be to rule / and maynteyne Iustyce / whiche is the helthe of Iustyce. Therfore yf thou hast ony thyng for to do aske councell / for thou arte but one man. And shewe not all thy courage to thy councelers nor lete thē not knowe what is in thy wyll to do. For yf y• shew thy mynde at ye begynnynge yu shalt be dyspraysed. Thā attempre thyn herte / and thy wyll / but here councel fyrst. And manyfeste not that / that lyeth at thy herte tyll thou come to put it in effecte. Consydre well the councell of euery man. And whiche of them hath Iu¦ged thy mater and counceled ye best for the / and with the best loue that he hath towarde yt. And whā thou hast thus recorded thy councell / put thy mynde in ef¦fecte without delay. For the gretest destruccyon that may come to a kyng is to bestowe in his werkes & to lese tyme. And yf so be that a yonge man of small esta¦te gyue the good councell / dyspyse it not / for it is pos∣syble that a man may be borne in suche cōstellacyō y• naturally he shall haue wysdome. ¶Example. ¶There was vpon a tyme a chylde borne in the par¦tyes of ynde. In the hous where this chylde was borne were certayne wyse men lodged / whiche foun¦de that the sayd chylde was borne vnder suche a con∣stellacyon / planet / and sygne that he sholde be wyse / meke / courteys / amyable / fresshe of wytte / and shol∣de
be loued of kynges & grete lordes. whiche thynge they wolde not shew to ye fader which was a weuer. whā ye chyld came to aege ye fader & moderset hym to theyr occupaciō / but he coude neuer lerne for ony bea¦tyng nor chastysemēt. At ye last they lete him do as he lyst / & he set his mynde to lerne scyēces / & ye moeuyn∣ges of ye skyes / & of all thȳges aboue nature. Also he lerned good cōdycyōs & maners to ye gouernaunce of prynces & kynges. And fynally by his wytte & wys∣dome he was ruler of all ye coūtre. Another example. ¶In ye realme of ynde were .ii. chyldrē / whā one of thē came to aege ye kyng set hȳ to scole for to lerne seye¦ce & all ye studyes of ynde & had ye best techers in all y• {pro}uynces for to teche hym in all y• spede y• coude e pos¦syble as to a kynges sone belonged. But all the dyly¦gēces of his fader and other techers auayled nothyn¦ge nor coude make hym enclyne neyther by his may¦ster nor by his nature to lerne ony seyēce nor arte but onely forgynge or smythes crafte / wherof the kynge merueyled / and sore troubled sent for all the wysest of his realme / and demaunded of thē how it myght be that his sone wolde lerne nothynge but onely smy∣thes craft. And they answered that the kynde of the chylde was of suche complexyon / and that he was inclyned to that arte and to none other. Therfore de∣re sone Alexander dyspyse no man of lowe byrthe nor of small stature yf thou se ony scyence or ony wysdo∣me in hym / and that he haue also good condycyons and maners in hym / and booth exchewe vyces. Su¦che one so wel manered is wrothy to be loued of pryn¦ces and kynges. And thou ought for to do nothynge without coūcell. And I pray the dere sone that thou
loue hym y• loueth trouthe & y• coūceleth y• faythfully & tyme cōtrary to thyn opynyon. For suche a mā is stedfast of courage / faythfull & Iust to ye & thy sub∣gectes. And ye coūcel of such a man is good to ye gouer¦nayle of ye kynge & of his realme. For hermore lette not thy besynesses y• sholde be fyrst done be y• last. &c. But do euery thynge by coūcell & ordre For coūcell is ye shewer of al thynges to come. It is behoueful ther∣fore y• y• do all thy werkes by coūcell of faythfull & se∣crete coūcelers. For thy wysdō by ye coūcell of thē shall encrease / as the see ēcreaseth by ye ryuers & floodes y• fall in to it. And ye better yu mayst wynne by ye myght of warryours. It is foūde wrytē y• a grete wyse mā of ynde wrote lettres to his sone in this wyse ¶My well beloued sone / it is behouefull y• yu beleue coūcell in all thy besynesses / for yu arte but one mā. Take coū¦cel therfore of suche as yu knowest can gyue the good. And aboue all thȳges spare not thy enmy / but whā yu mayst shew thy vyctory ouer hȳ And euer beware of y• power of thy ēmy. Trust not in thy owne wytte nor ī y• grete heyght of thyn estate / but euer take coū¦cel of other / which yf thou seme good & prouffytable accepte it / & elles not. And also I admonest ye & coūcell ye chefely y• thou neuer make none of thy offycers thy lyeftenaūt onely nor gyue hȳ thy myght / for his coū may destroy ye / thy realme / & thy subgectes. And seke alway to his own prouffyt & thy vndoyng. But thou ought to haue dyuers offycers / & yf yu wyll assay and proue ony of thē thou must fayne y• yu hast grete nede of money. And yf he councel the to take of thy treasu∣re & Iewelles for to spede he loueth ye and is faythful to y•. And yf he coūcel the to take ye money of thy subge¦tes
to make thē poore he is corrupte & hateth the mo∣che. But yf he be such one that wyl offe the his own goodes and say. Syr by the gyfte and grace of god I haue goten some goodes I gyue them to the / suche ought to be praysed and loued best / as he which had leuer to gyue his goodes awaye than the poore sub∣gectes sholde be taxed and destroyed. Proue also thy offycers and yf thou se that ony of them dooth his of∣fyce dylygently and more for thyn honoure than he is cōmycted / thou ought gretly to trust in hym. And yf there be ony that delyteth in takyng of gyftes and gapeth for promocyō / & to gadre treasure / put not thy trust in hym. For suche a mā is lyke a hurle pytte wt∣out botome / for the more that he hath the more he co∣ueyteth to haue. And suche one is the destruccyon of a realme many wayes. For {per}aduenture the brennyn¦ge desyre that he hath to gete rychesses maye moeue hym to do many euylles / and maye chaunce the pro∣curacyon of thy deth. yf thou perceyue suche an offy∣cer / lete hym not be ferre frome thy presence. And suf∣fre hym not to make treaty with straunge lordes nor prynces / nor wryte no newes to them. And yf thou doubt that he dooth the cōtrary chaūge hym with∣out ony delay. For the courage of many men be soone chaunged / and lyghtly inclyned to do contrary thyn¦ges. ¶Also dere sone thou ought to cherysshe ye offy¦cer that loueth & moeueth thy subgectes to loue the. And that putteth his persone and goods to thyn ho¦noure / and that hath these propryetees folowynge. that is to wyte that he be parfyt in his lymmes for to trauayle in his offyce that he is chosen to. That he be courteys / lowly / and eloquent / and that his wor∣de
accorde with his hert. That he be a clerke wyse & well condycyoned / laborous & sober of mouthe in ea∣tynge and drynkynge / not lecherous / nor player at dyce and other dysordynate games. That he be har∣dy / & set not his mynde on golde nor syluer / nor other thynge of the worlde / but that / y• belongeth to the go∣uernaunce of the / and the realme. That he loue the welth of his neyghbours as of thē that be erre. And that he hate all wronges / and by Iustyce yelde eue∣ry man his owne. That he be angry with thē that do iniuryes & extorcyons / & that he greue no mā wrō¦gefully. And that he be perseueraun & stedfast in his purpose which is behouefull. That he be wtout feare and in good wyll. That he knowe the stynce of his ex¦pences. And that he prolonge nothynge that may be prouffytable to the realme. And y• gyueth not thy sub¦gectes cause to cōplayne of hym in doynge agaynst y• comȳ wele. That he be not ful of wordes / nor a gre¦te laugher. That none be refused comȳg to his hous And that he be dylygent to here & enquere of newes and tydynges That he cōfort the subgectes and cor∣rect theyr werkes / & helpe thē in theyr aduersytees. E. ¶Of kynges secretaryes. DEre sone it behoueth to chuse the a secre∣tary for to wryte & knowe thy secretes / he must be a man of grete wysdome and well lerned / for to vnderstande thy myn∣de. He ought to be trusty and eloquēt and that can speke dyuers languages for to put thy besy∣nesses in goodly ordynaūce and semely speche. For as
a fayre garmēt honoureth y• body of a kynge / so good∣ly speche arayeth and indeweth a lettre. And also he must be trusty to hyde & kepe close thy doynges. And y• he suffe none to come to y• place where thy wrytyn¦ges be & ye none se thē. Swete sone such {per}sones ought to be cherysshed & well rewarded for theyr seruyces. And exalte thē in suche wyse y• they be alwayes dyly¦gent in thy necessytees & nedes. For in thē is contey∣ned thy glory and honour / or thy lyfe & destruccyon. F. ¶Of a kynges messagers. MYghty emperour ye messagers alway she∣weth the wysoome of hym y• sendeth thē. They ben ye eyes ye eeres / & the mouthe of theyr lord It behoueth for thy messagers or ābassadours to chuse suche as bē moost suffycyēt / of clere vnderstādyng / wyse / honourable / & trusty / which loueth thy honour / & hateth thy dysho¦nour. (For in thy court yu mayst finde thē bothe). And yf yu fynde suche discouer & shewe thy courage to thē. And yf yu fynde none suche or better / fynde one y• wyll trustely bere thy lettres / & brynge the an answere of them. And yf yu fynde y• thy messager be coueytous to do his owne prouffyte & to gete gyftes / truste not in hym / but ētyerly forsake hym. And also make no mā thy messager y• wyll be drōke / for by suche one it shall be sayd & knowē y• ye lorde is not wyse. And ferthermo¦re make not thy messager of thy gretest offycer / & lete hym not be ferre from the / for it may well be the vn∣doyng of the & y• realme. And yf yu sende messagers by whome ony treason come to the / I tel the not y• mea¦sure of payne y• they ought to suffre but do therin as
thou semest best. G. ¶Of the gouernaunce of the people. FAyre sone thou knowest y• thy people & sub∣gectes bē ye hous of thy mynde / & y• treasure wherby thy realme is cōforted. For thy real¦me & subgectes bē as an orchyarde wherin bē dyuers trees berynge fruyte / the which trees ha¦ue dyuers rotes & sedes for to bere / growe / & multy∣ply ye fruyte / & be y• defēce & durable treasoure to thy realme / & of thy myght. It behoueth than that thy subgectes be well gouerned & y• thou take thought and care to that / that is nedefull for thē / and to bewa¦re that no vyolēce nor wronges be done to them / and after theyr condycyons and wontes to ordre them. Than gyue to them a good offycer that intēdeth not to theyr vndoynge / but that intendeth to rule them well / Iustly and in quyete. And se that suche an offy¦cer be wyse / full of good maners / well condycyoned / and pacyent. For yf he be not suche one / wyte thou y• the wyse men that were good before / wyll become euyll and rebell agaynst the. Also se that thou haue good and dyscrete Iuges and y• shall be worshyp to the / and encrease of thy court / and of thy reame. And that the sayde Iuges be not corrupte with gyftes and mede / and that they haue good notaryous sery∣bes / and egall sollycitours & aduocates y• wyll not ta¦ke brybes as it happeneth seldom. Dere sone I pray the and admonest the that thou put thy selfe often in batayle / and take oftentymes the councell of them of thy court. But put the not with thē that onely by en∣uy and couetyse entreth presumptuously in batayle. And blame not nor dyspyse thy mē of warre / but vse
fayre wordes amonge them / and often promyse thē gyftes and honours. And in no wyse put thy selfe in batayle tyll thou be pourueyed of al necessary armes and other thynges therto belongynge. And whan y• seest thyn enmy renue sodaynly vpon hym / and not slowly / and euer haue good outryders and watches about thyn hoost. And lodge the alwayes as nyghe as thou mayst to hylles / woodes and waters. And haue alway more haboūdaūce of vytayle thā nedeth And aboue al thynges grete quantyte of trompettes abours and other mynstrelles. For they gyue force myght / and reioyce them that be with the / and make dyuysyō & feare to thyn enemyes. And be not alway armed ī one harneys / but with dyuers. And be well stored with archers & handgōnes. And ordeyne some of thy men to renne / and other to stande stedfastly in thy baayles. Conforte thy men with fayre wordes and gyue them courage / & herty them to fyght. And aboue all thynges dere sone beware of treason with all thy power / and haue euer good knyghtes about the well & swyftely horsed that yf chaūce happē that thou must nedes flee / that by them thou mayst saue thy persone. But yf thou see ony of thyn enemyes fle haste the not to chase thē but kepe thy folke alway to∣gyder the moost that thou mayst. And yf thou wylt assawte castelles or townes haue grete quantyte of gynnes / and artyllery for to breke the walles. And pouruey the of connynge myners / and grete nōbre of archers and crosbowes. And do soo that thou mayst take away the water from them of the fortresse. And euer kepe some of thy enmyes for to knowe theyr do∣ynges within. And yf thou can not haue it but by ba¦tayle
doo it. For alway the last ende of theyr werkes ought to be batayle. And this ought to be done whā thou can not haue them otherwyse. And doo all thy werkes by councell and not hastely. ¶Of the physonomy of people. AMonge all other thynges of this worlde I wyll that thou knowe a noble and mer¦uaylous syēce that is called physonomy by the which thou shalt knowe the natu∣re and condycyō of people. And it was foū∣de by a phylosophre named Physonomyas / the whi¦che sought the qualytees of the nature of creatures ¶In the tyme of the sayde Physonomyas reygned the moost wyse physycyē y• pocras. And bycause the fame of physonomyas and his wysdome was so gre¦tely spreddde / the dyscyples and seruauntes of ypo∣cras toke his fygure secretly / and bare it to Physono¦myas to here how he wolde Iuge and say by ye sayd fygure of ypocras. And bade hym say and tel the qua¦lyte therof. whan Physonomyas had well beholden it / he sayd. This man is a wrangeler lecherous and rude. This herynge the dyscyples of ypocras / they wolde haue flayne Physonomyas / and sayd to hym. A fole this is the fygure of the best man of the worl∣de. whā Physononomyas sawe them thus moeued / he appeased them the best waye that he coude with fayre wordes saynge. I knowe well that this is the fygure of the wyse mā ypocras. And I haue shewed you by scyence as I knowe. whan the dyscyples we¦re come to ypocras they tolde hym what Physono∣myas
had sayd. And ypocras sayd. Truely Physo∣nomyas hath tolde you the trouthe / and hath left no thynge of my complexyon in the whiche ben all my vyces. But reason that is in me ouercometh and ru∣leth the vyces of my complexyon. ¶Dere sone I ha∣ue shortely abreged to the / the rules of this scyence of Physonomy / the whiche shall infourme the gre∣tely. ¶yf thou se a man with salowe coloure / flee his company / for he is inclyned to the synne of lechery / and to many euylles. yf thou seest a man that smy∣leth lyghtly / and whan thou beholdest hym he wyll loke shamfastly and wyl blusshe in his face and sygh with teeres in his eyes yf thou blame hym for ony thynge / surely he feareth the and loueth thy persone Beware of hym as thy enmy that is tokened in his face / and of hym also that is mysshapen. The best cō∣plexyon that is / is he that is of meane coloure with browne eyes & heere and his vysage betwene why and reed / with an vpryght body / with a heed of me∣tely bygnesse / and that speketh not but of nede be / wt a softe voyce / suche a complexyon is good / and suche men haue about the. ¶yf the heeres be playne and smothe the man is curteys and meke / and his bray∣ne is colde. Harde heere and curled is a token of foly & lewdnesse. Moche heere on the brest and on the bely betokeneth very yll or very good complexyō natural∣ly and is very amerous / and kepeth in his herte the iniuryes y• hath bē done to hym. Blacke heere betoke¦eth to loue reason & Iustyce. ¶Duskysshe eyes be∣tokeneth fooly / & lyghtly to be angry. Gray eyes be∣tokeneth honeste / & louȳge peas. Bygge eyes betoke¦eth to bē enuyo{us} / vnshamefast / slowe & vnobedyet.
Eyes meane betwene blacke and yelowe is of good vnderstandyng / curteys / and trusty. wyde retch yn∣ge eyes and a longe face betokeneth a mā malycyo{us} and yll. Eyes lyke an asse alway lokyng downe is of harde nature and nought. waueryng eyes with a lō face betokeneth gyle / rennynge mynde and vntrusty Reed eyes betokeneth to be strōge and of a grete cou¦age. He that hath spekles about his eyes / whyte / blacke / or reed / is the worst of all other men. Thycke heered eye lyddes is an yll speker / he that hath them haugynge longe to his eyes / is neyther true nor cle∣ne. He that hath heere ynough bytwene his two bro¦wes and be thyn̄e and not to longe / is of a good and grete vnderstandyng. ¶Asklendre nosed man is soo¦ne angry. A longe nose hawked to the mouthe / is a tokē of honeste and hardynesse A snytted nose is a to∣ken to be soone vexed. wyde nosethrylles in a man is slouth and boystousnesse and soone angered. A brode nose in the myddes is a grete speker / and a lyer. But y• best is he that is meane neyther to wyde nor to clo∣se. The vysage that is ful & flat / and that is not swol¦len nor to bygge is a token of an yll persone / enuyo{us} / iniuryous / and a wrāgeler. But he that hath a mea¦ne vysage of fourme of chekes and eyes / neyther to fat nor to leane / he is trusty / louynge / and of grete vn¦derstandynge / wyse and full of seruyce and wytte. ¶He that hath a wyde mouthe loueth batayle and is hardy. He y• hath thycke lyppes is folysshe. And he that hath a wrynkled face is a lyer / and careth not of many debates. He that hath a sklender face is of gre∣te reason. He that hath a lytell vysage and yelowe of colour is a deceyuer / dronken / and uyll. Full eyes &
smothe chekes is soone angry. ¶Small eeres beto∣keneth foly / and lchery. ¶He that hath a small voy¦ce & speketh thycke loueth feyghtynge. He that hath a meane voyce / neyther to bygge / nor to lytell / is fo∣lysshe and vnreasonable. And he that speketh to mo∣che with a sklender voyce / is not ouer honest / and of smal care. He that hath a femynyne voyce is soone an¦gry / and of yl nature. A softe voyced man is often an∣gry and ēuyous. He that hath a fayre voyce / is folys∣she / and of hyghe courage. He that speketh lyghtly / lyeth often / and is a deceyuer. And he that speketh wt¦out moeuynge his handes / is of grete wysdome and honeste. ¶He that hath a sklender necke / is hote / pe∣ceytfull / and folysshe. He y• hath a grete bely is prou∣de / lecherous / and vnwyse. ¶He that hath a large brest / thycke sholdres / and bygge fyngers / is hardy / wyse / gentyll / and of good wytte. He with a sklender backe agreeth neuer with ony other. He y• hath his brest & backe egall / is a token of honeste. Hye reysed sholdres / is a tokē of lytell fydelyte / nought / and shar¦pe. He that hath longe armes rechynge to the knee / is of grete boldenesse / sadnesse / & lyberalyte. Shorte armes betoken that he loueth socour / and is folysshe. ¶Longe palmed handes with longe fyngers / is or∣deyned to lerne many scyēces / and artes / and specyal handy craftes / and be of good gouernaūce. Fyngers short and thycke / betoken foly. ¶Shorte thycke fete and flesshy / betokeneth to be folysshe / and full of iniu∣ry. A lytell lyght fote / is a man of smal vnderstandyn¦ge. A sklender fote sheweth a man to be symple / and of small knowlege. He that hath a thycke fote is har∣dy and folysshe. ¶The length of y• legges / & the heles
betoken strength of the body. A thycke flesshy kne / is soft and weyke. ¶A man that gooth a grete pace / is wyllynge in all thynges / and to hasty. ¶He is of a good nature and complexyon / that hath softe flesshe and moyst / meanely smothe and rough / and that is kyndly betwene reed and whyte. ¶He that hath a smothe contenaunce / softe heere & playne / with mea∣ne eyes of bygnesse / with a well proporcyoned heed / a good necke and suffycyent in length / with sholders somdele lowe / and his legges and knees metely fles∣shed his voyce competent clere / y• palmes of his han¦des and fyngers longe and not thycke / and that he laughe but lytell / and that is no mocker / with a smy¦lyng chere and mery / is of good cōplexyon. Howbeit dere sone I commaunde the not to Iuge al vpon one sygne / but consydre all the tokens of a man whiche moost habounde and sheweth y• foly in hym / and hol¦de the to the best and moost prouffytable party. ¶Deo gratias. ¶Thus endeth the abstract of the secrete of secretes of Arystotle prynce of Phylosophres. ¶Here folowe certayne reasons of the grete phyloso¦phre Sydrac to the kynge Boctus / whiche I haue translated out of the Pycardes speche / thynkynge it necessary in this sayd treatyse. ¶How one ought to vttre his speche.
YF thou hast ony mater of grauyte or sad∣nesse of reason / to shewe and declare befo∣re noble and wyse audyence / tell it breue¦ly and wysely / with a good bolde coura∣ge and wyll / and than they wyll take it hertely / and wyll gyue credence to thy wordes and alowe thy saynge. For wyse men wyll gladly gyue eeres to wyse and short informacyon. And therfore be not shamefast nor afede to tell the trouth. For many one haue lost theyr ryght by shamefastnesse and frate of theyr vtteraunce of wordes / though theyr causes were good. ¶The maner of angre. THou oughtest not to be angry though thy brother or frēde shew the heuy chere som∣tyme / for peraduenture he hath some cau¦se wherfore he can shew the / nor other no fayre semblaunt. And this thou mayst cō¦sydre in thy selfe. For yf thou were angry thou coude shewe hym / nor none other good chere or countenaū∣ce / and so it is with hym. And yf thou hast had ony wordes with ony man / and he shewe the yll counte∣naūce / therfore yet thou ought not to be angry with hym. For perchaunce he is oo lewde or vnwytty of hymselfe that he can do no better / and yet he weneth that he doth wel / for euer the lewdest sheweth moost anger. For whan a wyse man is angry / he sheweth it not outwarde by his reason. A man ought more to feare the anger of a wyse man than of a foole / for the wyse man can better reuenge his angre than a foole /
howbeit that a foles angre is often comberous. ¶To vttre secretes. IN one maner onely thou ought to shew thy secretes / that is to wyte to almyghty god that knoweth al thyng / that is to be vnder¦stande / to his lyeftenaūt in erth / and other wyse not. For yf thou dyscouer it to thy frē¦de. And yf thy frēde be but lewde / & hath another frē¦de yt he loueth / to whome he telleth thy secrete / and his frende hath another frende that telleth hym the same / and so frome one to another tyll a grete meyny do knowe it / & so thy secrete may come out to thy gre¦te shame and rebuke. For whyles thou kepest thy se¦crete within the / it is sure. For thou mayst shew thy secrete to suche one that whan he knoweth it wyl do the some wrōge / and for feare that thou hast of hym yt dare not gaynsay hym leest he bewrey the. And yf thou can none otherwyse but that thou must vttre it by thy foly / and that thy stomake wyl swell for to tel it / go out of company and tell it to thy selfe as yf thou wolde tell it to another man / and thy hert wyll coole and thy stomake swage. And for ony nede that thou hast to dyscouer it / take hede to whom / but yf it be to suche one that for ony anger that thou doost to hym wyll not rebuke the wt it. And neuer lete thy neygh∣boure knowe thy nede / for therby thou mayst be the lesse set by in places where thou dwellest. ¶How thou oughtest to sporte with thy frende.
LOke wysely how thou playest or bourdest with thy frēde (or other) with thy handes or with thy mouth / for yf thou do hym har¦me / harme may come to the. with sportȳg with handes cometh angre and murdre / whyther it be thy brother or frende. For yf thou hurt hym or wryng his hande / or cast hym downe / or smy¦te hym otherwyse / it shall greue hym / & shame hym in his mynde / albeit that he be lytell and weyke / for eche in hym selfe counteth hym stronge / bolde and fyers / and yet he wyll prayse hym selfe thoughe he be a cowarde and nought. And yf thou mocke hym / thou shalt spyte hym to the hert / for he wyll thynke that thou dyspysest hym / & y• thou reputeth hym at nought. And yf thou mocke hym before people / thou doost hym yet more spyte / & he shall owe the yil wyll and hate the deedly. For of mockynge cometh an∣gre and grete hate / though it be thy brother or other frende. But thou ought to pastyme with fayre wor∣des / and to shewe goodly auctorytees and reasons to drawe theyr loue to the / for by that pastaunce thou mayst come to y• goodnesse / loue & curteysy of people. ¶The maner to doubt and trust thyn enemy. WHyther thyn enemy be stronge or wey¦ke / thou ought not to doubt hym to mo¦che / nor trust to moche to hym. For he y• is ouercome to day / may be vyctour to morow. And he that is vyctour to day may be ouerthrowē to morow. And he that doubteth none / none wyll haue doubt of hym. To moch doubt
maketh to moch trust / and to moche trust maketh to moche domage. For he that bereth doubt alwaye wt hym / hath a grete burdē & payne.
