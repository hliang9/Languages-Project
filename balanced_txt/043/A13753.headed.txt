A discouerie of the treasons practised and attempted a∣gainst the Queenes Maiestie and the Realme, by Francis Throckmorton, who was for the same arraigned and condemned in Guyld Hall, in the Citie of London, the one and twentie day of May last past. 1584.
To the Reader. THere is in this short discourse de∣liuered vnto thee (gentle reader) a true report of the treasons and practises of Francis Throckmorton, & his cōplices against the Queenes Maiestie and the Realme: which comming to my handes by chance from a gen∣tleman, to whom it was sent into the Countrey, I haue presumed to cōmit the same to the print, to the ende that such as in opinion and conceite are not satisfied, touching the matters proued a∣gainst him, and the course of proceeding helde with him, might by the sight thereof (if trueth and reason may perswade them) bee resolued of all such doubtes and scruple as haue risen by the variable reportes made of the qualitie of his offences, and the maner of dealing vsed towards him: for the better knowledge whereof, I referre thee to the declaration fol∣lowing, and so commit thee to God.
A letter sent from a gentleman of Lions Inne to his friend, concerning Francis Throckmorton, who was arraigned and condemned of high Treason. SYr, with my last letters of the first of Iune, I sent vnto you in writing the arraignemēt of Francis Throckmorton penned by a gētle∣man of good skill and credite, being present at the same and because it hath seemed vn∣to me that there is some scruple in your con∣ceite touching the sufficiencie of the euidece produced against him, I haue for your better satisfaction endeuoured to attaine to more particular knowledge thereof, and by the meanes of a secret friend, there is come vnto my hands, a verse perfect de∣claration, of the whole proceedings helde by such as were in commission for the examining of him before his triall coutal∣ning the materiall pointes of the treasons by him confessed, where unto there is annexed a submission written by Francis Throckmorton to the Queenes Maiestie, the fourth of Iune, whereby he acknowledgeth that he hath vntruely and vnduetifully denied his former confessions, & vnder his hand writing hath eftsoones repeated and confessed the same confessions to be true (some fewe things onely detracted, but of no moment:) which may in mine opinion remooue all matter of doubt or scruple conceiued by you or by any other of his iust condemnation. You know howe well I haue alwayes loued the man, and delighted to conuerse with him in respect of the good partes wherewith he was indued, and of the pleasant hu∣mour that for the most part did possesse him when hee came in companie of friendes, yeelding at no time (to my seeing) any shew or suspitiō, to haue bene a dealer in matters of that qua∣litte: & therefore I cannot but pitie his misfortune the more, wishing all men to make profite of his fal, and to note, that mi∣serie and calamitie of this kinde, doeth for the most part fol∣lowe such as forget God, to whose protection I committe you. From Lyons Inne, the 15 of Iune. 1584. Your assured friend. Q.Z.
A true and perfect declaration of the Treasons practi∣sed and attempted by Francis Throcke∣morton, late of London, against the Queenes Maiestie and the Reaime. WHereas there haue bene very lewde and slaunderous bruites and reportes giuen out, of the due and orderly proceedings held with Francis Throckmorton lately anaigned and condenmed of high trea∣son at the Guildhall in London the xxi. day of May last, whereby such as are euill affected toward her Malestie, and the present gonernement, haue inde∣uoed falsely and iniuriously to charge her Maiestie and her faithfull ministers with crueltie and iniustice used a∣gainst the said Throckemerton by extorting from him by torture, such confessions as he hathmade against himselfe, and by insorcing the same to make thom lawful euidence to conflict him of the treasons therein specified. Albeit her Maiesties subieuts in general walling to minde ye milde and temperace course she hath helde all the time of her most happie Reigne, might rather impute her clemencie and lenitie vsed to wards all fortes of offenders to a kinde of fault, then taxe her in the contrarie: yet such as allowe of practise and treasons against her Maiestie, de awayes interpaexe both of the one and of the other, according to the partiouias affections that docopossesse them, that is, to the worst. And forasmuch as the case of Throckemorton at this time hath bene subiect to their sinister constructi∣ons, and considering that lies and false bruites cast abroad are most commonly beleeuch until they be ontrossed by
the trueth: it hath bene thought expedient in this short discourse to deliuer vnto your view and consideration, a true and perfect declaration of the treasons practised and attempted by the said Throckemorton against her Maie∣stie & the Realme, by him confessed before his arraigne∣ment, whereby her Maiestie was iustly and in reason per∣swaded to put him to his triall. You shall likewise per∣ceiue what course hath bene helde with him by her Com∣missioners to bring him to confesse the trueth: with what impudencie and how falsely he hath denied his sayings and confessions: And lastly, how by a new submission and confession of his said treasons sithens his condemnation, he endeuoureth to satissie her Maiestie, and to shew the reasons thea mooued him to denie the first, which he af∣firmeth and confirmeth by the last: which may in reason satisfie, though not all, yet such as are not forestalled, or rather forepoysoned and infected with the lies and vn∣truthes alreadie spred and deliuered, in fauour of the trai∣tor and his treasons. You shall therefore vnderstand, that the cause of his apprehension grewe first vpon secret in∣telligence giuen to the Queenes Maiestie, that he was a priuie conueiour and receiuour of letters to and from the Scottish Queene, vpon which information neuerthelesse diuers moneths were suffered to passe on, before he was called to answere the matter, to the end there might some proofe more apparant be had to charge him there with directly: which shortly after fell out, and thereupon there weresent vnto his houses in London, and at Leusham in Kent to search and apprehoud him, certaine gentlemen of no me anc credice and reputation of whom, two were sent to his house by Poules wharfe, where he was appre∣hended, and so by one of them conuayed presemly away, the other remaining in the chamber to make search for papers, writings, &c. which might giue proofe of his fuspected practises. In that searth, there were found the two papers contar∣ning
the names of certaine Catholique Noblemen and gentlemen, expressing the Hauens for landing of forraine forces, with other particularities in the said papers men∣tioned, the one written in the Secretarie hand, (which he at the Barre confessed to be his owne hand writing) and the other in the Romane hand, which he denied to be his, and would not shewe how the same came vnto his hands: howbeit in his examinatiōs he hath confessed them both to be his owne hand writing, and so they are in trueth. There were also found among other of his papers, twelue petidegrees of the discent of the Crowne of England, printed and published by the Blshop of Rosse, in the de∣sence of the pretended title of the Scottish Queene his Mistresse, with certaine infamous libelles against her Ma∣iestie printed & published beyond the seas: which being found in the hands of a man so cuill affected, comparing the same with his doings and practises against her Ma∣iestie, you wil iudge the purpose wherefore he kept them. Shortly after his apprehension, hee was examined by some of her Maiesties priuie counsell, how he came by the said two papers of the Hauens, and he most impudently denied with many protestations that he neuer sawe them, affirming they were none of his, but were foisted in (as he termed it) among his papers by the gentlemen that sear∣ched his house: Notwithstanding being more earnestly pressed to confesse the trueth, he sayd they had bene left (he knew not how) in his chamber by a man of his, who not long before was departed out of the Realme, named Edward Rogers, alias Nuttebie, by whome they were written. And to make this deuice to carie some colour of trueth, after his committing to the Tower, hee found the meanes to get three Cardes, on the backeside of which Cardes he wrote to his brother George Throck∣merton to this effect: I haue bene examined by whom the two papers, conteining the names of certaine Noblemen and gen∣tlemen, and of Hauens &c. were written: and I haue allea∣ged
them to haue bene written by Edward Nutteby my man, of whose hand writing you knowe them to be: Meaning by this deuice to haue had his brother cōfirme his falsehode. These Cardes were intercepted, and thereby the suspition before conceiued of his practises increased, whereupon, as vpon other iust cause and matter against him, hauing bin sundrie tunes brought before some of the principall per∣sonages of her Maiesties most honorable priuie counsell, and by them with all industrie examined, and perswaded in very milde and charitable maner, to confesse the trueth, promising to procure pardon for him, in case he woulde bewray the depth of his practises: but no persuasion pre∣uailing, her Maiestie thought it agreeable with good pol∣licie, and the safetie of her Royal person and state, to com∣mit him ouer to the hands of some of her learned counsel and others her faithfull seruants and ministers, with com∣mission to them, to assay by torture to drawe from him the trueth of the matters appearing so waightie as to concerne the inuading of the Realme, &c. These men by vertue of that commission, proceeded with him, first as the counsell had formerly done by way of persuasion, to induce him to confesse: but finding that course not to preuaile, they were constrained to commit him to such as are vsually appoin∣ted in the Towre to handle the Racke, by whom he was layd vpon the same, and somewhat pinched, although not much: for at the end of three daies following, he had recouered himselfe, and was in as good plight as before the time of his racking, which if it had then or any other time bene ministred vnto him with that violence that hee and his fauourers haue indeuoured slaunderously to giue out, the signes thereof would haue appeared vpon his limmes for manie yeeres. At this first time of torture, hee would confesse nothing, but continued in his former ob∣stinacie and deniall of the trueth. The second time that bee was put to the Racke, before hee was strayned vp to any purpose, hee yeelded to confesse any thing
hee knewe, in the matters obiected against him: whereupon he was loosed, and then the Commissioners proceeded with him according to such Interrogatories as had bene deliuered vnto them, which for the more breui∣tie shall here bee omitted, the intent of this declaration, tending onely to discouer vnto you the treasons and trea∣cherous dealings of the said Francis Throckamorton aswell before as sithens his imprisonment, for your better know∣ledge of the man, and manifestation of the due and iust proceedings held with him by her Maiesties Commissio∣ners appointed to that seruice. And here you are to note, that when hee was first pressed to discouer by whome the plottes of the Hauens were sette downe, and to what pur∣pose, he began (without any further interrogation mini∣stred) by way of an historicall narration, to declare that at his being at Spaw in the Countrie of Liege certaine yeres past, he entred into conference with one Ienney a notori∣ous knowen Traitor, touching the altering of the state of the Realme here, & how the same might be attempted by forraine inuasion, and to the like effect bad sundrie confe∣rences with Sir Francis Englefield in the low Countreys, who daily solicited the Spanish king in Spaine, & his Go∣uernours in the said Countreyes, to attempt the inuading of the Realme, continued a course of practising against her Maiestie and the state, by letters betweene Sir Francis Englefielde and himselfe, vntill within these two yeres last past, and that he did from time to time acquaint Sir Iohn Throckemorton his late father with his traiterous practises, who (as he said) seeing no probabilitie of sucoesse in them, dissuaded himfrō any further medling wt those practises. He hath further confessed, ye he vsed his Fathers aduise & opinion in setting downe the names of the Catholique Noblemen and Gentlemen, and did acquaint him with the description of the Hauens for the landing of forces, which he conceiued and put in writing onely by view of the Mappe, and not by particular sight or suruey of the
said Hauens. Item, he hath also confessed, that vpon the intermission of writing of letters, and the accustomed intelligences passed betweene Sir Francis Englefield and him, he was made acquainted by his brother Thomas Throckemorton, by letters & cōference, and by Thomas Morgan by letters (two ōf the principall confederates and workers of these treasons reslding in France) with a resolute determination agreed on by the Scottish Queene and her confederats in France and in other forreine partes, and also in Englande, for the inuading of the Realme. That the Duke of Guyse should be the principal leader and executer of that inuasion. That the pretention (which shoulde be publiquely no∣tified) should be to deliuer the Scottish Queene to libertie, and to procure euen by force from the Queenes Maiestie, a tolerance in religion for ye pretended Catholiques: But the intention, (the bottome whereof should not at ye first be made knowen to all men) shoulde be vpon the Queenes Maiesties resistance, to remooue her Maiestie from her Crowne and state. That the Duke of Guyse had prepared the forces, but there wanted two things, money, and the assistance of a conuenient partie in England, to ioyne with the forraine forces, and a third thing, how to set the Scottish Queene at libertie without perill of her person. For, ye first thing wanting, viz. money, messengers were sent from forraine parts both to Rome & Spaine, & their returne daily expected to their liking: And the Spanish Ambassador to encourage the English to ioyne both in purse and person, did gine out, that the King his Master woulde not onely make some notable attempt against Englande, but also woulde beare halfe the charge of the enterprise. For the seconde thing, viz. the preparing of a sufficient partie in England, to receiue and to ioyne with the forraine forces, one especiall messenger was sent ouer
into England in August last, vnder a countersaite name from the confederates in France, to signifie the platte and preparation there, and to sollicite the same here. That Thomas Throckemerton his brother made him priuie to his negotiation at his last being here in England, and that thereupon Frauncis Throckmerton tooke vpon him to be a follower and meane for the effectuating ther∣of among the confederats in Englande with the holpe of the Spanish Ambassadour, whom he instructed howe and with whome to deale for the preparing of a conuenient partie heere within the Realme, for that himselfe woulde not be seene to be a sounder of men, lest hee might be dis∣couered, and so endanger himselfe & the enterprise, know∣ing that the Ambassadour being a publique person, might safelie deale therein without perill. That the Duke of Guyse and other heads of the enter∣prise had refused some landing places, and made speciall choise of Sussex, and about Arundel in Sussex, both for the neere cutte from the parts of Fraunce, where the Duke did or best could assemble his force, and for the oportunitie of assured persons to giue assistance, &c. That hee, taking vpon him the pursuite of this course, shewed the whole plotte and deuise of the hauens for lan∣ding to the Spanish Ambassador, who did incourage him therein, he promising, that if hee might haue respite vntill the next spring, the same should be done more exactly. That at the time of Thomas Throckemertons being here, least the negotiation of the enterprise, by some casualtie might faile in the only hand of one man Thomas Throck, morton, there was also from the confederats sent ouer in∣to Sussex, Charles Paget, vnder the name of Mope, alias Spring, and therof an aduertisement couettly sent to Tho∣mas Throckmorten, both that Thomas might vnderstande it, and not be offended that another was ioyned with him in his labour. That the Spanish Ambassadour by aduertisements from
the confederates, was made priuie to this comming of Charles Paget vnder the name of Mope, and yet knowen to him to be Charles Paget. That the said Ambassadour did according to his sayde aduertisements, knowe and affirme that Charles Paget was come ouer to view the hauens and Countrey for lan∣ding of such forraine forces about Arundell, and specially to sound and conferre with certaine prineipall persons for assistance. The same Ambassadour also knewe and affirmed, that Charles Paget had accordingly done his message, and had spoken with some principall persons heere, according to his commission, and was returned. Hee moreouer confessed that there was a deuice be∣tweene the Spanish Ambassadour and him, howe such principall Recusants here within the Realme as were in the Commislion of the peace in sundrie Counties, might vpon the first bruite of the landing of forrame forces, vn∣der colour and prert of their authoritie and the defence of her Maiestie,  men, whome they might after ioyne to the forraine forces, and conuert them against her Ma∣iestie. In these fewe articles is briefly comprised the whole ef∣fect of his confessio made at large without any Intert oga∣tonie particularly ministred, other then vpon that opa∣pers before mencioned, contayning the names of men o hauens. And heere you are to note that at the time of his apprehension, there was no knowledge or doubt had of these treasons, or of his priurtie vnto the in, but onely an information and so pition deliuered & conceiued of some practese betweene him and the Scottily Queene as to be∣fore mentioned. For the discouering whereof, after he had bene sundrie times vpon his alleagaunce commended to declare his doings in conueying and receyuing of letters to and from her, he did voluntarily confesse that hee had written diuers letters vnto her, and had conueyed many
to and fro, betweene her & Thomas Morgan in France, by whose meanes he was first made knowē vnto her, & that he had receiued as many letters from her. Hee also decla∣red the effect of his letters to her, & of hers to him: which letters betwene them were alwaies written in Cipher, and the Cipher with the Nullities and markes for names of Princes and Counsailors, hee sent vnto the Queenes Ma∣iestie written with his owne hand, Hee also deliuered the names of some, by whom hee conueyed his letters to the Scottish Queene, as by one Godfrey Fulgeam, who fled the Realme immediatly vpon Throckemortons apprehension, and one other person, whom he described by his stature, shape, and apparell, and the man sithens apprehended and examined, hath confessed the same: the mans name is William Ardington. The summe and effect of the most part of these confes∣sions, although they were at the time of his arraignement opened and dilated by her Maiesties Sergeant, Atturney, and Sollicitor generall at the barre, and therefore seeme not needfull to be repeated heere, yet because the purpose of this discourse is to shew sufficient proofe, that the mat∣ters contained in his said confessions, are neither false nor fayned (as Frauncis Throckmorton most impudently affir∣med at his triall, alleadging that they were meere inuen∣tions of him selfe by policie to auoyde the torture) they haue bene here inserted, to the ende you may the better iudge of the proofes, presumptions, and circumstances folowing, by comparing the matters with their accidents, and consequently see the falsehoode of the Traitor, the iust and honourable proceedings of her Maiestie, and the honest and loyall endcuours of her Ministers imployed in the discoucring of the treasons. First, it is true and not denied by himselfe, that he was at Spawe about the time by him mencioned, and had con∣ference with Ienney in that place, and with Sir Francis Englefield in Flaunders, and that he hath written letters
to. Sir Frauncis, and receiued letters from him: for if he should denie the same, he were to be conuinced by good proofe: for it hath bin noted in him by many of his coun∣trey men English subiects, that both in those partes and in Fraunce, hee did continually associate him selfe with English Rebels and Fugitiues, If then you consider with whom he hath conuersed beyond the seas, and com∣pare his religion with theirs, you wil iudge of his conuer∣sation accordingly: and it is to be supposed, that those men, knowen to be continuall practisers against: the Queenes Maiestie and this Realme, from whence for their Treasons and vnnaturall demeanures they are wor∣thily banished, will not in their conuenticles and meetings forget to bethinke them of their banishment, and howe they might be restored to their countrey, whereunto no desert in her Maiesties life time (which God long conti∣nue) can wel (without her Maiesties great mercie) restore them. Then I pray you what conferences might M. Throckemorton haue with Sir Francis Englefield, with Ienney, with Liggons, with Owen, and with such like, who were his daily companions in Fraunce and in the Iowe, countreis? He hath written letters to Sir Frauncis Engle∣field: to what purposes? he haunted continually two Ambassadors in London, by whose meanes he sent and receiued letters to and from beyond the seas daily. To whom, and from whom? euen to and from Thomas Mor∣gan, and Thomas Throckemorton at Paris, men knowen to her Maiestie and her Counsell, to be notorious practisers, very inward with the Duke of Guyse, and contriuers of the Treasons and deuises for the inuasion intended: and for very certaine knowledge thereof, we neede not be be∣holding to Frauncis Throckemorton onely, (although he hath said much of them) but to others of better credite then himselfe. That the Duke of Guyse did vndertake the enterprise to inuade the Realme with a forraine power, to be de∣frayed
by the Pope and King of Spaine (a part of M. Throckemortons confession) and he in trueth the first dis∣couerer thereof to her Maiestie: if he will say that it was but inuention, it will approue false. For sithens he disco∣uered the same, there haue bene diuers aducrtisements thereof sent to her Maiestie from forraine Princes her Highnesse louing neighbours and Allies, as also by other good meanes and intelligences from her Ambassadours and seruants residing in other Countries. If he denie (as he hath done) that he neuer had know∣ledge of any such matter when he confessed the same, it hath no likelihood of trueth for Throckmorton was neuer knowen to be a Prophet to foretell things de futuro. He resorted often to the Spanish Ambassadour, at the least twice in a weeke when he was in London: this of∣ten repayre could not be to conferre with the Ambassa∣dour for the exchange of money for his brother, as he pretended at his arraignement: there was some other cause. When he was apprehended, he had a Casket coue∣red with greene veluet, very cunningly cōueied out of his chamber by a maide seruant of the house, taken vp vnder a beds side in his chamber (one of the gentlemen who were sent to apprehend him then being in the chamber and vnknowing thereof) which Casket not long after his apprehension, was by one Iohn Meredith a follower of Frauncis Throckemorton, conueyed to the handes of the Spanish Ambassadour: and why to him? If the matters therein might well haue abidden the light, why shoulde not the Casket haue bene kept still at home? and if not there, why not sent to some other place of safetie, as well as to the Spanish Ambassadour? It is to be conceiued, that this Casket was not conueyed thither without the direc∣tion of Frauncis Throckmorton, though caried by Mere∣dith, who did well knowe of what moment the matters were that were within the Casket, and of what danger to Throckemorton if they had bene disclosed, and therefore
meant to bestowe them in a safe place where they could not readily be had (as he thought) and with a person not vnacquainted with the qualitie of them. After the deliue∣rie of the Casket, Meredith fledde: for in trueth he was priuie to the sreasons, and a fellowe practiser in them: to whom Frauncis Throckemorton; being taken short at the time of his apprehension, and forced to runne vp a staire to deface a letter which he was then in writing to the Scottish Queene in Cipher (as he hath confessed) being suddenly apprehended, and so forced to depart away pre∣sently out of his house, deliuered priuily into the hands of Meredith, either the Cipher by the which he was writing his letter to the Scottish Queene, or a letter in Cipher by him written vnto her: therefore he trusted Meredith as a than priuie to his doings. You are also to vnderstande, that Throckemorton was in very great feare of the disco∣uering of this Casket after his apprehension: for remay∣ning two or three daies prisoner in the house of one of the gentlemen that were sent to apprehend him, before he was committed to the Towre, he was permitted to talke with a Sollicitor of his Lawe cause, who brought him cer∣taine bookes drawen, or other like papers written, which hee made showe to peruse, but that was not the matter why he sent for his Sollicitor: for in perusing ye bookes, he conueyed into them a litle piece of paper, vpon ye which he had written wta cole, I would faine knowe whither my Casket be safe, or to the like effect. The Sollicitor depar∣ting from him, and resorting to Throckemortons house not farre distant from the place where he remained pri∣soner, opening his papers, did shake out this piece of pa∣per, which he tooke vp and deliuered to one of Frauncis Throckemortons men, but the Casket was alreadie conuey∣ed to the Spanish Ambassadour: whereby you will per∣celue what care he had of the Casket, and howe much it might import him to haue the writings or matters within the same coucealed. He being examined touching the
Casket, and what was in the same, he denied at the first, that euer he had any such Casket, but finding afterwards that the Casket was discouered, he confessed the Casket, and saide there were certaine letters therein that came to his hands for the Scottish Queene from Thomas Morgan at Paris, and other letters and Papers, but conselled not all, as it is supposed. That Charles Page came ouer into the Realme to euil purposea, as Throckemorton doth declare in his confession, could not be inuented: for euen at the same time that he mentioneth. Paget came ouer, in secrete and suspitious maner staied not aboue xv dayes, indeuoured in a sort to finde the disposition of William Shallen Esquier, how hee might stand, affected to giue assistance to the treasons, al∣though Paget discouered not directly his traiterous intets to Shelley: therefore all Throckemortons confessions were not forged or inuented. But because the two papers produced at his arraigne∣ment, containing the description of the Hauens for the commodious landing of forces, do most apparantly con∣demue him, & are a manifest argumēt of his priuity to the whole treasō, you may not forget ye he acknowledged one of the papers written in the Secretarie hand, to haue bene of his owne doing, but denyed the other written in the Romane hande: In the which vnder the title of Cheshire &c. is said, Vpon the landing of forraine Supplies, Chester shal be taken: but what in your opiniōs might be vnderstoode by that sentence, Chester shalbe taken, when you shal com∣pare ye paper in Secretarie hand with ye other writtē in the Romanc hande, intituled, The Names of Noblemen and gentlemen in euery Countie fitte to bee dealt withall in this matter. (which in trueth were both one, although the Ro∣mane were somewhat more inlarged.) The question is to bee asked, What matter? The answere followeth necessa∣tilie, To assist the forraine forces that shall come to inuade the Realme: for that there is an other title in that paper
ouer the names of the hauens, &c. Hauens in euery coast fitte for the sanding of forces. Now iudge you, to what end these names of men and descriptions of Hauens, their en∣tries, Capacities, what windes bring vnto them from Spaine, France and Flanders, were written and set downe by Throckemorton, the papers are both of his owne hand writing, and the Secretarie but a proiect or copie of the Romane. Is it not likely thinke you, that he would acquaint the Spanith Ambassadour with these papers (as he hath con∣fessed) when he made him partaker of the rest of his trai∣terous practises & deuies is you haue heard, & thought his Casket of treasons to be most safely committed to his hands. It may bee thought that there is no man of so simple vnderstanding, that will iudge to the contrarie, vnlesse he be partially affected to excuse the treasons. And now to shew vnto you what mynd this man hath carried towards her Maiestie, you are to be informed that Francis Throckemorton, after he had discouered to her Ma∣iestie his course of practising, repenting himselfe of his plaine dealing in ye bewraying thereof, sayd to some of the Commissioners vpon occasion of speach, I woulde I had bene hanged when I first opened my month to declare any of the matters by me confessed. And being at other times sent vnto by her Maiestie with offer of pardon, if he would dis∣close the whole packe and complices of the treasons, hee vsed this argument to perswade her Maiestie that he had confessed all, saying that sithens hee had alreadie brought himselfe by his confessions within ye danger of the lawes, to the vtter ruyne of his house and familie, hee wondered why there should be any conceite in her Maiestie, that he had not declared all. But to perswade such as were sent vnto him for these purposes, the rather to beleeue that hee could discouer no more, at one time hee vied these spea∣ches following with great vehemencie: Nowe I haue dis∣closed the secrets of her who was the decrest thing vnto me in
the worlde (meaning the Scottish Queene) and whome I thought no torment should haue drawen me so much to haue preiudiced as I have done by my confessions, I see no cause why, I should spare any one, if I could say ought against him & sub. I haue failed of my faith towards her, I care not if I were han∣ged. And when hee began first to confesse his treasons, which hee did most vnwillingly, after hee was entred into the declaration of them, before al the Commissioners vp∣on aduisement, hee desired hee might deliuer his know∣ledge but to one of them onely, whereunto they yeelded, and thereupon remouing asule from the place where hee sate by the Racke hee vsed this prouerbe in Italian, Chia perso la fede a perso l'honore, that is. He that hath falsed his faith, hath lost his reputation: Meaning thereby (as it may be conceiued) that he had giuen his faith to bee a Traitor, and not to reueile the treasons, and then began to confesse as you haue heard. By this discourse, contayning the principal heads of his treasons, and the proofes & circumstances of the same, you that are not transported with vndutifull myndes & affec∣tions, will cleerely perceiue bowe impudently and vntrue∣ly he denyed at his arraignement the trueth of his confes∣sions, charging her Maiestie with crueltie, & her ministers with vntruethes in their proceeding against him. But the cause that moued him thereunto, was a vaine conceito he had taken, that his case was cleerein lawe by the intermission of the time betwene his confession made & his arraignemēt, grounding him selfe vpon a Statute of the 13, yere of her Maiesties Reigne, in ye which there are certaine treasons specified & made of that nature, that no person shalbe arraigned for any of those offences comitted within anie of the Queeues Maiesties dominious, vnlesse the offendor be thereof indicted within sixe moneths next after the same offence committed, & shal not be arraigned for ye same, vnlesse the offence be proued by the testimonie and othe of two sufficient witnesses, or his voluntarie con∣fession
without violence: wherein he was greatly decei∣ued: For it was made manifest vnto him by the L. chiefe Iustice & other of the iudges in Commission at his trial, that his treasons were punishable by a Statute of xxv. Edw. 3. which admitted no such limitation of time or proofe. Herein his skin failed him, and forgot the aduiee giuen vnto him by some of the Commissioners, who (pitying his misfortune for sundrie good gifts of the minde appearing in him) assured him that there was no way so readie for him to redeeme his life, as by submission and acknow∣ledging of his offence, which for a time after he had con∣fessed his treasons, he was contented to followe, and now eftsoones after his condemnation by a new submission to the Queenes Maiestie the fourth of fune hath resumed, that course. The submission verbatim written with his owne hand, followeth. To her most excellent Maiestie, euen to her owne Royall handes. MOst excellent Prince, and my most gratious Soueraigne, sith to mee the most miserable of all your Maiesties poore distressed subiects, being iustly condemned by the ordina∣rie and orderly course of your Maiesties Lawes, there resteth no further meane of defence but submission: vonchsafe, most excellent Prince, graciously to accept the same, which pro∣strate in all hunmilitie, I here present vnto the hands of your most excellent Maiestie, be seeching the same, that as Iustice bath bene deriued from your highnesse, as from the fountaine, to the triall of mine actions: so I may receine from the same  some droppe of grace and mercie for the great & grie∣uous offence where of I rest by your Maiesties Lawes iustly condemned: some part, I say, of that your accustomed grations elemencie, whereof most your distressed subiects haue rasted, & few bene depriued. And albeit the inconsiderate rashnesse of
vnbridled youth hath withdrawen me from that loyall respect, which nature and duetie bounde me to owe vnto your Maie∣stie, as to my lawfull and naturall dread soueraigne, and that the naturall care in me of the defence of my life mooned mee lately to the vntrue and vnduetifull gainsaying of some such pointes as had bene before by me in most humble sorte confes∣sed: neuertheles, I most humblie beseech your most excellent Maiestie, that in imitation of God, whose image (both in re∣spect of the happie place you holde, as also in regarde of your singular wisedome and other the rare and singular vertues & perfections wherewith God and nature hath plentifully in∣dewed you) you represent vnto vs here in earth, it may please your Maiestie to cōmiserate the lamentable estate of me now the most miserable of all your Maiesties subiectes, and grati∣ousty to graunt vnto me remission and forgiuenes, that not on∣ly doe most humblie confesse my selfe worthie of death, but also in shewe of my repentance and sorowfull afflicted minde, doe not craue at your Maiesties handes the prolonging of my life, if the same shall not stande with your gratious good plea∣sure, but rather desire the trebling of the torment iustly by your Maiesties lawes imposed vpon mee, of the same may bee any satisfactiō to your Maiestie for the haynous cryme wher∣of I remaine by your Maiesties lawes iustly condemned, or any mitigation of your Maiesties indignation worthily con∣ceiued against me, that desire not to liue without your fauour, and dying will wish from my heart, that my ende may bee the beginning of your Maiesties securitie, and my death the pre∣servation of your life, and the increase both to your Maiestie, and to this your most flourishing common wealth, of all the most happie blessings of almightie God. Your Maiesties most wofull subiect in that he hath offended you. Francis Throckemorton.
HE sent vnto her Maiestie together with the sayd submission, a declaration written likewise with his owne hand, contayning the effects of the most principall pointes of his treasons formerly confes∣sed: retracting onely the accusation of his father, and some other particularities of no moment to cleare him of his treasons, the effect whereof followeth in his owne words, as he set them downe.The decla∣ration. THe onely cause why I coyned the practise first by me confessed, & vniustly touched my father, was, for that partly I conceiued that the paper written so long sithens, could not now by lawe haue touched me: but principally, for that I was willing thereby to colour the setting downe of those names and hauens in Romane hand, which were written long after the time by me confessed vpon occasi∣on of conference betweene the Spanish Ambassadour and me of this later practise. Mine intelligence with the Scortish Queene began a little before Christmas was two yeres: the Cipher I had from Thomas Morgan in Fraunce: the first letter I recei∣ued by Godfray Fulgeam, by whom also came all such o∣thers as I after receiued for the most part, vnlesse it were such as came to me by F. A. his hands, who as hee tolde mee,William Ardington. receiued them of the fellowe by me spoken of in my former confessions, whose name, I protest before God, I knowe not, nor whence he is. And for such letters as came vnto mee in the absence of Fulgeam, they were inclosed vnder a couerture from Fulgeam, & were deliuered me by the hands of Robert Tunstead his brother in Law, to whom I deliuered such as I had for the Scottish Queene, couered with a directiō to Fulgeam, and once I remember or twise I sent by one of my men called Butler, letters for the Scot∣tish Queene to the house of the said Tunstead, neere Buck∣stones, couered with a direction to Tunstead, and vnder a letter to Fulgeā. In such letters as came to me frō the Scot∣tish Q. were inclosed letters to F. A. many times, & most
times some for Thomas Morgan. Her letters to mee con∣tayned, &c. But before I retourned mine answere to her, I vnderstoode of the death of the Duke of Lenox, and with∣all heard from Morgan, with whom all mine intelligence was (for with my brother I neuer had any, other then that the matters by mee written to Morgan, were by him im∣parted to my brother most times) that by the perswasion of the Pope and the King of Spaine, the Duke of Guyse had yeelded to performe the iourney in person: and that it was thought that the next way to attayne libertie for the Scottish Queene, and to reforme Scotlande, was to begin here in England; and therefore he desired to knowe from me, whether in mine opinior. Catholiques woulde not backe any such force as should be sent, considering a de∣maunde of tolerance in religion for them, should insue the wel performing of the said enterprise, and what I thought the force would amount vnto, both of horse and foote∣men, and where I thought to be the fittest landing. Mine answere was, that as then, I sawe no great probabilitie of the good successe of such an enterprise, for that the Ca∣tholiques were timorous, dispersed, the matter perilous to be communicated to many, without which I saw not how any estimate could be made of the forces: besides, that it was an eminent danger to the Scottish Queene, whereof I sawe no remedie. I tooke notice of this matter in my next letters to the Scottish Queene, whose answere was, that shee lately heard of that determination, &c. Vpon my former answere to Morgan, he desired me, ye I would conferre with the Spanish Ambassadour, to whō I should bee recommended from thence: hereupon the said Ambassadour sent for me, and brake with me in this matter, assuring me ye in his opinion he found it verie casie to make great alteration here with very little force, consi∣dering the disuse in men to warre, and troubles woulde so amase them (as he thought) that they woulde be assoone
ouerthrowen as assailed, and he could not thinke but in such a case Catholikes would shewe themselues, sith the purpose tended to the obteyning for them libertie of con∣science: and therefore hee desired mee to acquaint him, what I thought men would doe in such a case, and where I thought the fittest landing, and what holdes in these partes were easiest to be surprised. I answered him, that as it seemed, the enterprise stood vpon great incertainties, if it depended of the know∣ledge of a certaine force to be found here, which no man could assure him of, vnlesse he had sounded all the Catho∣likes, which was not possible without manifest hazarde of the discouerie of the purpose: for as for any great per∣sonage, I know no one to be drawen into this action, that could carie any more then his ordinarie retinew: the one∣ly way in such a case was (I tolde him) for such as woulde bee drawen into this matter, and were of credite in their countreys, to leuie forces vnder colour of the Princes au∣thoritie. But for that these things depended vpon vncertaine groundes, which was not fit to be used in so great an acti∣on, I said it was to be resolued, that the force to bee sent should be of that number, that what backing soeuer they should finde here, they might be able of themselues to en∣counter with any force that might be prouided to be sent against them, and therefore they could not bee lesse then 15000. men. For the place of their landing, I said it de∣pended much vpon the force that should be sent: for if that were in great number, it mattered not where they landed: if in a small companie, then was it requisite that it shoulde be in the Countreys best affected, and furthest from her Maiesties principall forces, which I said to be in the Nor∣thren parts on either side. To the danger of the Scottish Queene by me obiec∣ted, he said he knewe no remedie, vnlesse she might be ta∣ken away by some 200. horse, which I tolde him I sawe
not to be possible, for that I knewe not any gentleman in those partes (which were men, if any, to perfourme it) that I durst wish to bee made acquainted with the matter before hande. Finally, our conclusion was, that I should informe him of the Hauens as particularly as I could: and within fewe dayes after, finding by him that the force intended hither, was farre inferiour to that I spake of, and that there was some different betweene the Pope and the king of Spaine for the charge, I tolde him that the surest course and of least danger were, to send a supplie into Scotland, where a small force would breede a great alteration, and things being there established by the good liking of the king, I thought it was in him by a continuall warre, and by incur∣sions so to anoy this state, as her Maiestie here shoulde be forced to yeelde the libertie of the Scottish Queene, and what should thereupon haue bene reasonably demaun∣ded for the benefite of Catholikes here. And herein I said it would be a great furtherance, if at the same time some fewe were landed in Irelande, where, although they abid the same hazarde that the former forces sustained, yet would the charge be so great to her Maiestie, and so great an occasion of dispersing of her forces, as a much lesse companie then was spoken of first by me, would (be∣ing landed here in a conuenient place) shake the mindes of men generally, and be of force (if any thing) to drawe them to shewe themselues, in the furtherance of the purpose. He vtterly reiected the purpose for Ireland, and dis∣liked not the purpose for Scotlande: but still hee was in minde to haue forces landed here, and therefore desired me verie earnestly to inquire particularly of the Hauēs on the side of Cumberland and Lancashire, and what men were dwelling there that were well affected in religion, and what places easie to be taken, and what apt for forti∣fication.
The next time that I went to the Spanish Ambassa∣dour, he found himselfe a grieued that he vnderstood mat∣ters were determined in France without his priuitie: and told me that Parsons the Iesuite was gone to Rome, sent as he thought, to vnderstand the Popes minde. Soone after came ouer my brother Thomas, to make an ende of our accompt, and to perswade me to come ouer, assuring mee that for ought he could see in likeli∣hood, the enterprise was neuer like to take effect. In the time of his being heere; and while I entertained intel∣ligence with the Scottish Queene concerning her li∣bertie, the Spanish Ambassadour sent for me, and tolde me of the comming ouer of Mope to view Sussex and the Hauens, and as he thought, to taste the best of accōpt there: whereat he seemed to bee agrieued, for that such matters had not bene left to him, beeing one that they in France made beleeue that they relyed vpon principal∣lie in this enterprise. Afterwardes, the Ambassadour tolde me, that it was Charles Paget, and that he was returned, but where he had bene hee knewe not, and at the same time I receiued a letter from Morgan, that it was Paget: but assuring me, and so willed me to assure the Ambas∣sadour, that his comming was not to moue any man, but onely to viewe the countrey, for that the moouing of any man was referred to him. I did so: and he intreated me to remember him for those foresaide names and Hauens, saying that so it were done exactly by the Spring, it would suffice: for that sooner he saw no likeliehoode of the exe∣cution of the enterprise. My brother hauing made an ende of his accompt with me, retourned with this resolution betweene vs, (I protest before God,) ye if the enterprise succeeded not betweene this and the next Spring nowe past, that I woulde fettle my things here and goe ouer. And for this cause, he being gone, I went downe into the countrey, both to fell and take order for my land in those partes, as also to setch the
draught of Gentlemē & Hauens for the most part of Eng∣land, which had bene set downe by me aboue two yeres since, and left behinde me at Feckenham in my Studie. Not finding the draught at Feckenham, I returned to London, where I founde the note of names in Secretarie hande, which I caried to the Spanish Ambassadour, and there drewe that other in Romane hande in his Studie, putting downe Chester to be taken, in respect of the ea∣finesse as I thought, & the rather to giue him incourage∣ment in the matter. I left it with him, promising him that by the next spring I woulde perfect it, if I taried so long, making knowen vnto him, that I was had in suspition, & my determination to be gone: but he pressed the contrarie of me, assuring me, that if the enterprise proceeded not, he would then also depart. Whether Sir Frauncis Englefielde were a dealer in this practise or no, I know not: but sure I am (for so the Spanish Ambassadour tolde me) that Sir Frauncis had intelligence with the said Ambassadour all the time of his being here. The Spanish Ambassadour tolde me that he heard the people of Northwales were generallie wel affected, and therefore he desired to haue the hauens of that countrie: I tolde him that hereafter I would helpe him thereunto, al∣though no good might be expected there, for the reasons by me set downe in my first confession; and hereupon the day before mine apprehension, the Ambassadour sent me backe the said paper in Romane hand, desiring me to set downe the same at my leasure more exactly, which was the cause that it was not in my greene veluet Casket. The writings in my Casket were sireh as were by mee confes∣sed, and came vnto my hands as I haue confessed. I Most humbly beseeche her most excellent Maiestie, that the extremitie which I haue alreadie sustained, and the causes by me discouered, to the safetie of her Maiestie and the state, not made knowen (as hath appeared) by any other meane then by my selfe, may craue at her handes,
the extending of her gratious commiseration towardes the relieuing of the lamentable estate of me, her Maiesties poore distressed subiect, & mine, if God for mine offences forbid not the same. Nowe iudge all yee, that be not peruersly affected, whether Throckemorton be iustly condemned, and whe∣ther his confessions (though as hee pretended, extorted from him by violence) be of force in Lawe against him: he hath conspired to ouerthrowe the state: to bring in strangers to inuade the Realme: to remoue her Maiestie from her lawfull and naturall right and inheritance to the Crowne of England, and to place a stranger in her seate: but this last point, for placing of a stranger, will (per∣chaunce) be denyed: then note, that in the whole course of the practise, the greatest barre to the prosecution of the enterprise, was, they found no way how to put the Scot∣tish Queene in safetie. Then, if these dangerous treasons be discouered by torture, (the onely meanes left vnto Princes to discouer treasons and attemptes against their States and Persons, where they finde apparant matter to induce suspition, as in the case of Throckemorton, vpon sight of the plottes of hauens &c.) may the Law touch the traitour or not? If any man holde this question negatiue∣ly, hold him for a friend to traitours and treasons, and an enemie to the Queenes Maiestie, whome God long pre∣serue, and confound her enemies. FINIS.
