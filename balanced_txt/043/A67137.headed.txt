LONDON, Printed by I. M. for H. Cripps and L. Lloyd, and are to be sold at their shop in Popes-head Alley, 1651.
The Wounds of a Friend; OR A Letter mentioned by Mr Love upon the Scaffold, &c. READER, I Understand that Mr Love in his Speech upon the Scaffold, a little before his death, amongst other things, made mention of a certain Letter, sent unto him the night before he should have been ex∣ecuted the last Moneth, which he called an insulting Letter, importing a resolution in some to publish in print several things reflecting dishonor upon him after his death: The truth is, the Letter he spake of was written by my self, and his jealousie of any mans writing concerning him after his death had its rise onely from a marginal note of the said Letter, which it seems made a deep impression upon him; and since his death I per∣ceive that not onely Mr Love, but some of his friends, did take that Letter very ill at my hands, especially con∣sidering that deep sense, pity and compassion that did (as they say) seem to appear in me towards him in his sad condition but a little before that Letter was sent, which was (I confess) so great, that as on the one hand, I could not be well satisfied how the Parliament could in Ho∣nor and Conscience have vouchsafed him a Pardon,
(they being indeed not their own but Trustees for the Commonwealth, and therefore obliged to pursue the publique and common benefit in saving or destroying him (his life being forfeited to the Commonwealth,) and no probable, much less certain publique advantage appearing to accrue from his Pardon, but rather a gi∣ving up their cause so maintained and assetted by him during all the time of his tryal; and nothing appearing to the contrary in all his post addresses, how ever slily and cunningly couch'd and pen'd;) so on the other hand my bowels and affections did so melt and yearn towards him that I verily beleeve I could have been contented in Gods way to have parted with one of my limbs for his life; and however I was by him and am by others un∣happily mistaken in that letter; yet God and mine own Conscience do witness for me the uprightness, plain∣ness and singleness of my heart and spirit, out of which I wrote it, for the spiritual peace and advantage of his soul, had he been pleased to have improved it to that end, be∣ing as I conceived, very genuinely & naturally improvable thereunto; And mine own Family can bear me witness (which I would not mention but upon this occasion) that with many prayers night and day, I did, according to my poor measure, importune the Almighty for grace and mercy for him until the time of his death. The truth is, I was plain and clear with him in my Letter, applying my self to him in such matter, which I thought might be most healthful and profitable for him; It is now about eleven years sithence my first ac∣quaintance with him, in which time I have had very many advantages, by a strict observation of him & his deport∣ment in publique and private, of inspection, as into his worth and excellency (whereof he was always suffici∣ently
sensible,) so into his weakness and infirmities (for I hope they were no worse,) and I found (and it was not onely my observation of him, but also many o∣thers, for alas it could not be hid) that he was exceed∣ing apt, not onely to be courted, but even captivated with that secret, close, and dangerous lust and sin of popularity, affecting multitude of followers, and not able to bear opposition and contradiction; and there∣fore well perceiving the policy of Satan, that great ad∣versary of mankinde, adepting and sitting this feare of death wherein his foot was so aptly and easily taken, and mounting him upon the wing and pinnacle of popular observation, and considering also his seeming peniten∣tial Addresses unto the Parliament, though cloudily, obstrucely, and very uncertainly fram'd and pen'd, ar∣guing (at least unto me) a kinde of a trembling, shaking and exceeding dissatisfactory frame and temper of minde, to venture his life upon so bad a cause; and un∣derstanding also by some of his very neer friends that were dayly with him, how uncertain he was in his disposition to an ingenuous, christian, and plenary acknowledgment in his Addresses unto the Parliament for mercy, and that by reason of the various and diverse disposed and opinionated persons that were his constant Visitors, some inclining him one way, and some another; some endevoring (as it seemed to me) to make him a meer Very tampera∣ble for such a purpose, being of a rash, furi∣ous, hasty, violent & popular temper & dispositi∣on. Calf, or Heifer, a Victim to their cause, though happily instructing him in that black art of double dealing, dis-ingenuous distinctions, and reservations to save his life, together with their cause (could it so be brought about) some of which friends I fear stuck too close to him even to his deathWhose altum si∣lentium, when their dying bro∣ther vent∣ed such bitter in∣vectives against the present Au∣thority, bespeaks either their own minds and judgments in the same; or themselvs very unfit ghostly fathers at such a time.,) Others again advising him to acknowledg his sin, and to give glory to God; I
say, perceiving this poor young man thus harrassed and hurried in his thoughts and minde; and ready to offer up his life in this perplexed temper and disposition; And lastly, calling to minde the most dangerous and de∣sperate estate and condition of his poor Soul, should he offer it up unto the service of this lust, not withstanding his seeming zeal for Gods glory, and the great tempta∣tion hereunto by a mighty concourse of people to see the manner of his death, and hear his last Scaffold Ora∣tion. These Considerations wrought upon me, out of very faithfulness, to write this ensuing Letter, which take as followeth. Mr Love, I do not know, nor am I much solicitous, whether you esteem me an enemy or a friend; but as I abhor to salute you with the Kisses of an enemy, so I judg it unseasonable to afflict you with the Wounds of a friend; and yet the bowels of a spiritual Brother (I know not whether you can eccho Brother to me,) do so implacably importune me, that I am compel'd, by the workings thereof, to be bold with you in one word of Counsel, before our final parting; it is this, Offer not up your precious life, with all its concernments, natural, spiritual, a victim to the great Godess of vain Professors po∣pulaity, (though confind within the Circle of a certain Party:) You may call this Censoriousness for want of love, but my consci∣ence calls it Faithfulness through the abundance of love: to be prais'd while you live, and talked on after you be dead, for a vali∣ant Assertor even unto death of that Cause judged by many of your own Friends and Judgment to be weak, yea wicked, is but a small price for this precious life, and the hazards of a better. It is well if the arms of Christ do bear you up above these troubled waters, and not windy bladders; but it is very rare, considering your Cause, the projecting, promoting, actual producing a new bloody War, a War between Saints, a War against Saints, a War to restore a wicked, a bloody Family, so signally and eminently dethroned by the vindicative Iustice of Almighty God, so decryed, so imprecated
with such zeal, expectation and confidence by your own self in publike, in private, and you not so much as touched with the guilt of a Busiy-body in all your Tryal and sufferings; how ever you have valud or undervalued your precious life, yet let not Bassilix eyes destroy your Soul, viz. an ambition to be look'd at, and ad∣mired: It is now high time to recollect your self, your Breeding, your Education, at whose charges, from what sort of Professors you have received mercy and favour all your life, and how you have requited them at the last, by not only not doing the least thing for them, but striving to undermine them in their Liberties, and fail∣ing therein to cut them off by a bloody War: I should have been glad, had the due consideration of your miscarriages wrought you to an ingenuous and Christian acknowledgment in due season for your life sake; I should now rejoyce, might it be yet considered for your Souls sake. Do you plead your Conscience? If it be so indeed, consider the strange hand of God upon your Judgment, not much unlike his hand upon the late King, (in whose Caue, how ever pal∣liated, you must yeeld up your life,) who could not submit to the Power that tryed him for his Conscience sake. That a Minister of Iesus Christ should intermeddle with the State and Condition of several Nations, so as to involve them in a bloody war, yea to strive to subvert that Government under which he might live a peaceable and quiet life in all godliness and honesty, a thing never practised by any of the Prophets of old, by Christ, his Apostles or Successors, that your self have judged faithful, (except you judg Iesuits to be such,) should do all this, not only without hesitansie, but with a zealous Conscience, argues a great hand of God upon such a Judgment. Again, do you plead Conscience, and therefore cannot subject to a Christian Consession of your miscarriage, though it might have saved your life, and that for Conscience sake? See here another strein of divine Iustice; you endeavored to bring in a Power, though by an Army, to compel mens subjection against their Consciences, and your self now must perish upon the same ac∣compt. But once more, Consider, is it Conscience indeed? Is it not rather Popularity, then Conscience? Shall I submit now? Will not the world say, 'tis base, 'tis dishonorable? &c. Well Sir, con∣sult God, and plead not Conscience against Conscience; it is bad to live, but worse to dye with an ill Conscience, especially under the vizor of a good Conscience; an ill Cause, yea and an ill Conscience may be slily palliated with many good prayers, Scripture phrases,
and a zealous shew of a very tender Conscience, and to dye stoutly in such a Cause, may be reputed Martyrdom amongst men, and just punishment with God; it may have a shew of pure Christianism with man, but it is pure Atheism with God; the more close, secret and spiritual any sin is, the more dangerous and noxious it is unto the sinner. Sir, I do not judg you, but I fear you, I would I had no cause; if I am mistaken, it is well, this can do you no hurt; if I am not mistaken, this may do you good, that is my aim, and the desire of my Soul; for if I know my heart, I could willingly part with my right hand in Gods way for your life, and with my very life in that way for your Soul: That the Lord of Life and Glory would so communicate himself yet unto you before you go hence, that ha∣ving a due sense of the riches and freeness of his grace in our dear Lord Iesus Christ, and so rest, peace, and fulness of satisfaction up∣on that accompt, and also a due feeling of your own miscarriages in all your ways, and chiefly of that that hath brought you to this pre∣cipitated end, that you may yield up your life as becomes such a sense, and that eternal life may second your temporal, is the hearty pray∣ers of Sir, Your very faithful and truly affectionate Brother in our Lord Jesus Christ, JOHN PRICE. Coleman street, London, Iuly 14, 1651. REader, Thou hast the Letter truly and faithfully committed to thy strictest view and examination, and submitted to thy Judgment; if thou findest any thing of an insulting nature there∣in, nay any thing but love and faithfulness unto Mr Love, most cer∣tain I am, thou reapest that which was never sown by me; nay it past a strict examen by a judicious godly man, one of Mr Loves very good friends and acquaintance, and very zealously industrious for his Pardon, before it was sent unto Mr Love; for indeed I feared Mr Loves sinister interpretation and misconstruction of it, who was very importunate with me to send it unto him: but it is true which Solomon saith, That a froward heart findeth no good. All that I shall say of Mr Love is this, His sin, vanity and folly have found him out, and pursued him to his grave, but I hope shall follow him no further: As for my self, I cannot with my self better (in wishes of this nature) then to desire God to ge me as ful a friend in the day of my departure from this world as I did desire to approve my self to Mr Love, and a better heart to improve the same. Farewell. FINIS.
