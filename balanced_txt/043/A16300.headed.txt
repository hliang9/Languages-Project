NEWES From Bohemia.

WITH A plaine Declaration, that those who belong vnto the Monasteries and Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction (according vnto his Maiesties Letters, and Agreements made betweene the States of the Reformed Religion and the Papists) haue good right, as being Sub∣iects of the Imperiall Maiestie, to the peaceable exercise of their Di∣uine Seruice, and building of Churches.

Newes from Bohemia. AN APOLOGIE MADE BY THE STATES of Bohemia, in their Defence against the Iesuites. WEE the Barons, Knights, &c. of Prage, Ruttenbergh, Cutna, and other Cities of the famous Kingdome of Bohemia, that re∣ceiue the holy Sacra∣ment of the Supper of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, vnder both kinds, and with one minde and consent hold, and acknowledge the Bohemian Confession; Now at this present assembled in the Castle of Prage, both in our owne names, and also in the names of those that are absent, send greeting, or make knowne vn∣to all men: That whereas, after many iniuries and calamities practised and done, in former yeeres, by the
meanes and procurements of certaine malicious and turbulent persons, not onely Secular, but also in title Spirituall (as they would pretend) specially that pernicious and most dangerous Sect of Iesuites, in the Kingdome of Bohemia (whose whole practises, actions, and counsels, tend onely and spe∣cially, by crafty and subtill meanes, not onely to bring our Kings soueraigne Maiestie, but also the States, and all the common people of the said King∣dome, that receiue the holy Sacrament of the pre∣cious Body and Bloud of our Lord and Sauiour Ie∣sus Christ (sub vtraque) vnder both kindes, into the yoke and subiection of forraine power, that is, of the Church of Rome) not onely by the Estates, but also by all others the Inhabitants of the said Kingdome, as well in Ciuill as Ecclesiasticall causes, sustained and endured. In the yeares of our Lord 1609. and 1610. all contentions and controuersies were fully pacifyed and ended; and to that end, by the Letters Patents of Rodulphus; the late Emperours Maiestie of famous Memory, as also by consent of both parts, that receiue the Sacrament as well sub vna, as sub vtraque: that is, vnder one, and vnder both kinds, at a generall Assembly or Parliament, then made and holden, it was firmely agreed vpon, and generally confirmed and consented vnto: that neither part should from thence-forth trouble, grieue or molest one the other; but that as well they that receiued sub vna, and those that communica∣ted sub altra, according to the Vnion made and con∣firmed betweene them, should from thence-forth, peaceably and quietly, at all times, and in all places,
without interruption either of Spirituall or Tempo∣rall Authority, freely serue God; as by the said Let∣ters Patents, Contract, and publique Assembly of Parliament holden, more at large appeareth. The which also his Imperiall Maiestie, our Soueraigne King, of his great and Princely clemencie, at his entry into the raigne of this his Kingdome, accor∣ding to the manner and ancient custome of the Land, not onely generally, but specially ratified and confirmed. Neuerthelesse, the aforesaid common enemies, as well of the King, and this Kingdome, as of all peace and quietnesse, haue spared no meanes, paines, nor labour, to deuise and practise, not onely, how, and which way, they might procure the breach and an∣nihilating of the said most desired and confirmed Peace; but also to effect their euill, wicked, and per∣nicious purposes and intents, secretly practised against this Kingdome, and the Inhabitants there∣of: And to that end, (when the said Peace and V∣nion was fully ratified and confirmed) reiecting all other points, not onely refused to agree vnto the said Letters Patents, and Peace made; but also vt∣terly denyed to subscribe vnto the Amnestia, (where∣by we, by the late Emperours Rodulphus, of famous memory, consent, were fully and wholly reconciled together, and all reuenge and euill will to surcease and be ended) but rather sought by all the meanes they could practise and deuise, wholly and altoge∣ther to dissolue and exterminate the same; and to many men daily shewed their wicked and malicious intent: whereas before they were not onely secret,
but in many causes and actions, open enemies vnto this their natiue Country, going about to bereaue and take from our present Lord and soueraigne King, the assignation of this Kingdome, and to trans-fer the same vnto another: But when they could not effect the same, and their hopes therein were al∣together frustrated (for that, by Gods mercy, in his time appointed, all things by the commandement of the Emperours Maiestie, our soueraigne Lord and King, were fully confirmed) they proceeded so far, through the procurement of the Iesuites, and others their adherents; againe by many slanderous reports, and censures, both by word of mouth, and writing, to publish and proclaime all those in this Kingdome that receiue the Communion vnder both Kindes, to be notorious Heretikes: with whom, according to a maxime of their Papisticall doctrine, they are not bound (as they teach) to keep or hold any faith or promise: giuing also diuers other new-fayned, and infamous names, both vnto vs, and the doctrine of the Gospell, to the great contempt of our Religion of receiuing vnder both kindes; and not onely that, but also in their scandalous writings affirme, all those that vse the same Religion, as also, all that are not conformable to the Romish Religion, to bee worthy of, and to haue deserued all kinde of In∣famie and punishment; animating the Secular Ma∣gistrate with fire and sword, to persecute all those that professe the receiuing of the Communion vn∣der both kindes. And the better to deceiue the simpler sort of peo∣ple, and to set diuision and enemity betweene those
of the reformed Religion: the said enemies of this Kingdome, and the common peace thereof, sought to set those whom we, by the Kings Maiesties Let∣ters Patents, and his Graces speciall Consent, had made Protectors and Super-intendents of our Reli∣gion, at variance: by that meanes not onely vtterly to with-draw them from their functions, but also wholly to subuert and ouerthrow our Religion. For in open Assemblies, when by meanes of their wic∣ked and secret conspiracies, they had sowed con∣tention and hatred among those of our Religion: when the said Vnion for Religion on our parts was made, and his Maiesties Letters Patents in Parlia∣ment rehearsed, as also a generall confirmation of all our immunities, and priuiledges of this King∣dome, confirmed by his sacred Maiestie our King now raigning, were in specie related; (purposely to further their wicked and malicious intents:) they were by them diuersly and contrarily interpreted. Sometime with great promises, and then againe with threatnings of incurring the Emperours Ma∣iesties indignation, they sought to disswade and terrifie the said Super-intendents from perseuering in the protection by them vndertaken: and by that meanes made such as in their profession of Religi∣on were not well grounded and confirmed, to doubt and to wauer; bringing others, by promises and hopes of dignities, to yeeld to them, by fearing and doubting to be wholly disgraced and reiected of men, as also not to lose the benefite of earthly pre∣ferment; and so, ere they were aware, forsaking the Truth once by them acknowledged and receiued,
fell from the same, to ioyne with them in their erro∣nious doctrine. Then proceeding further, hauing gotten and ob∣tained higher Offices and Dignities, not onely by Princely authority, and vertue of their Offices, but also by the Emperours Maiesties Regents, they found meanes to displace and thrust diuers old and well-deseruing persons of the Kingdome out of their Offices, and in the same to put other Captaines and adherents of their owne Religion, and by them troubled and molested the people for Religion: cau∣sing them, vnder pretence of temporall offences, to be punished and tormented. And such Ministers as, by authority from his Maiestie, were permitted to preach the Reformed Religion, in diuers Villages, they likewise displaced, and put others therein of the contrary Religion. And in the Townes of Prague, they also tooke such order, that those of the Papis∣ticall Religion obtained the chiefest Offices, who by subtill practises and threatnings, found meanes by their importunities, to deale in such sort with di∣uers Officers, and Counsellers of the reformed Re∣ligion, that they were constrained to do whatsoeuer they desired and commanded. Forasmuch therefore, as that it toucheth vs the Burghemasters and Councell, both of the old, new, and lesser Townes of Prague, which are of the Bohemian Profession, and communicate vn∣der both kinds: That whereas we and our Predeces∣sours, as also the rest of the Cities professing the Religion, by a full consent and agreement made by them and vs, vnder our hands and Seales, at a pub∣lique
Meeting, when any thing was to bee done and handled touching the Letters Patents, and the liberty of Religion, the principallest persons of the said Townes and Religion, as also of all other Townes of the same Profession, bound themselues faithfully to aide and assist one the other therein, vp∣on paine of incurring perpetuall shame and infamie: As also, that by the tenor of the said Letters Patents and Meetings, we were strictly bound, when or at what time soeuer, the Protectors of our Religion, and of the Vniuersitie of Prage, (hauing any thing concerning the said Letters Patents, and our Reli∣gion to be determined and deliberated vpon) toge∣ther with themselues summoned, the Lords of his Maiesties Councell, and the Iudges of both the Lawes to determine the same, there should sixe per∣sons out of each Towne of Prage, as also out of euery other Towne of our Religion, bee called to those Meetings: Which we did not so well know, and that because at those Meetings, Offices in Townes and Cities of this Realme were oftentimes innouated and changed; as also, that by those of the contrary Religion, that sate and were mingled a∣mongst vs, and by other meanes, we and our Pro∣tectors were much hindred in our proceedings; whē before the Emperours Maiesties departure from hence, expresse Commission was giuen vnto the Emperours Officers, all Papists, throughout the Townes of Prage, that they, contrary to all ancient custome, should take vpon them to enquire of the foundations of the Reformed Churches, as also to deale and meddle with the reuenewes thereof, and
that without them and their consents, we neither could nor should determine vpon, nor dispose of any cause concerning our Religion in any of our Dioces, as before wee had done: All which tend to the annihilating of his Maiesties libertie granted vnto vs by his Letters Patents, and of the Vnion (wherein, among other things, is contained and set downe, that as much as concerning those of the Religion, as also their Churches, that the Emperours Maiestie should not trouble himselfe therewith, but that they of the Religion themselues, without the Emperour, should end and determine the same) and were thereunto perswaded by them, that for be∣cause the said Protectors, hauing twice by their Let∣ters summoned them to meet, we (contrary to an∣cient custome) sent no man of our Religion there∣unto: but with them of the contrarie Sect, did con∣sult of things concerning our Religion (which they should not doe) and further wrote vnto the Empe∣rours Maiestie, our Soueraigne King, that wee sent no such vnto the Councell to deale or speake for vs, and that so we agreed and consented vnto their said proceedings. Adding further, that all of vs, with one full and free consent, had agreed not to haue a∣ny other Protector of our Cause and Religion, but onely the Emperours sacred Maiestie: whereby what iniury might thereby hereafter be done vnto vs, and in the meane time, to all those of our Reli∣gion, all men of equall and sound iudgement may well see. Wherefore, perceiuing our selues to bee decei∣ued, and in an error; and further, that it was told
vs, that as touching the supreme defence and pro∣tection of our Religion in this Realme, in our Pre∣face of the Bohemian Confession, which is printed, this is therein openly comprehended and set down; That all the three Estates of the reformed Religi∣on, and their Protectors and Consistories, would haue no other Defender nor Protector (next vnder God) but onely the Emperours Maiesty, our most gracious and Soueraigne King, and those to whom by the consent and certaine knowledge of his sacred Imperiall Maiesty, should by all the three Estates of the reformed Religion, be chosen to haue the ouer∣sight and care of their said Consistories. For these, and many other iust and reasonable cau∣ses, wee the said superiour States, haue at this pre∣sent assembled together in the Castle of Prage, both for, and in our names, and for those of all the three Estates of our religion (which haue not refused, nor gone backe from the protection, which for our reli∣gion is appointed, nor by no meanes will be drawne from it) by writing to make our reasonable excuse in this case, vnto his Imperiall Maiestie, and therein haue so much preuailed, that they once againe haue all faithfully protested to ioyne with vs in the same; & We for our parts haue vndertaken both presently, & promise in time to come, to maintain and vphold with all our power and might, euen to the last gaspe, all whatsoeuer belongeth, appertaineth vnto, or con∣cerneth the Emperors Letters Patents, and the Contents thereof, for our defence, (so they bee in such sort ioyned, as that the one cannot subsist with∣out the other) and be done with his Imperiall Ma∣iesties
consent. But that we the said three Estates of the reformed Religion may the better charge these publike enemies of the King, their Country, and the peace thereof, and make it apparant what they haue further practised, it is, that contrary to the lawfull proceeding in the Assemblies of the State of the Land to be holden, they haue made and ordained themselues as partiall Iudges of his Maiesties said Letters Patents, Assemblies and Vnion: And percei∣uing that his sacred Imperiall Maiesty, our King & soueraigne Lord, is otherwise employed in diuers waighty affaires and businesse concerning the estate of Christendome in generall, and thereby is not a∣ble to remember and thinke vpon all the immunities and priuiledges, contracts, compacts, and grants concerning the Realme; that they might set his Ma∣iesty at discord with the sayd three Estates of the re∣formed religion, and to mooue him to grant such commission to them, (which without doubt is con∣trary to the said Letters Patents,) they haue giuen out by writing to his Maiesty, that in the saide Letters Patents, & contract of Vnion, it is not con∣tained, that such subiects as are belonging vnto Cloysters, should haue any right or authority to build themselues Churches; whereas that is not re∣ferred to their owne iudgements, but as it is said be∣fore, is committed to both parts, that is, that if any question should rise thereof, lawfull iudgement and determination should be made and giuen therein by an equall number of persons of both religions there∣vnto purposely appointed. This notwithstanding, letting passe that manner of proceeding, at their pleasures they procured a Com∣mission
from his Maiesty, vnto the Towne of Bruna, to command them to surcease from proceeding to build their Churches begun. Which they of Bruna certifying to the Protectors and Superintendents of our Religion, by vs made and appointed thereunto, and therein sought to be holpen, desiring & reque∣sting, that they might therein bee ayded and prote∣cted by vertue of his Maiesties Letters Patents, and the Vnity made at the Assembly of the three Estates of the Realme, in the Parliament to that end hol∣den: The Protectors for their parts, vpon good de∣liberation and aduice by them taken, thought it con∣uenient to call the principall Officers, Iudges, the Kings Maiesties Councell of both lawes concerning the reformed Religion, and withall, sixe persons of resort and Towne (according to the Act of Parlia∣ment, and their instruction therein) to assemble and meete together in Prague, where beeing met, vpon good deliberation they found, that not onely those of Bruna, but also all others that are subiect vnto the Spiritualty within the Realme of Bohemia, (not onely by the Articles which are in this our Apology set downe in Print, but also for other reasons & cau∣ses which here for breuity sake are omitted) are par∣ticipants of, and ought to enioy the Benefits, Gra∣ces, and Priuiledges, which belong, and are giuen by the Emperors Maiesties Letters Patents vnto those of the reformed Religion: The said Letters Patents among other things specifying (that contra∣ry to the same, and our securities, no Commission or Prohibition, which in any sort might hinder, or let our proceedings, eyther from his Imperiall Maie∣sty, and his Heyres or Successors, Kings of Bohe∣mia,
nor by any other whatsoeuer: And that if a∣ny such should bee giuen forth or permitted, the same should be of no force nor validity in any such case, what pretence or allegation soeuer should ther∣in to the contrary bee made, set downe, or preten∣ded.) Whereupon, when we the sayd three Estates and Protectors, vpon good deliberation and aduice, had made and giuen this answer vnto the inhabitants of Bruna, the Hill townes, and Cloysters graues which are vnder the Archbishops of Prage, that they shuld proceed to the building vp of their Churches, and in the same for the honour of God, vse their accusto∣med manner of preaching, &c. (alwaies with this condition, that otherwise they should in all things behaue themselues peaceably, honestly, and ciuilly, and not to stirre, moue, nor giue occasion vnto any one of the contrary Religion, much lesse to the Lord Abbot, or the Archbishops, as being their Superi∣ours, of the least cause of offence or motion to an∣ger whatsoeuer, either by word or deed, (as knowing well that the same is specially, and expresly forbid∣den) but to the contrary, that they should behaue themselues towards them in all reasonable obedi∣ence concerning worldly and politike matters, as true subiects ought to doe.) All we of the three E∣states of the reformed Religion, at the Assembly holden in the Castle of Prage, Anno 1615. by com∣mon consent of the Protectors, and vnder our hands in a generall and free Court, did approue, ratifie, and confirm it, and also at that Assembly made it known vnto the Emperors Maiesty, as to our King and So∣ueraigne
Lord: as also diuers and sundry old wrongs, oppressions, and iniuries which were not only done and committed in the places aforesaid touching the Vnion, but also to the preiudice of his Maiesties au∣thority Royall, vnto the common people, contrary to the expresse meaning of his Maiesties Letters Pa∣tents, hoping to procure some releefe and redresse therein, before our said Assembly should breake vp. The said common enemies of the King, the Country, and the Peace thereof, continuing in their accustomed secret practices & deuices, and perswa∣ding themselues that they could worke the Empe∣rors Maiesty as they list, they found the meanes that our three Estates could in no manner get any answer from his Maiesty therein, before their Assembly brake vp. And further, besides that, certaine persons by their meanes, at common and ordinary Assemblies, Courts, & expeditions vsed all manner of hard pro∣ceedings and courses against those of the Religion: at the last, they proceeded so far, that they brought vpon our three Estates of the Religion, beeing the Emperors Maiesties true and faithfull Subiects, (be∣sides the former ouer-heauy burthens layd vpon vs & our poore subiects) for the space of fiue yeares, being most great and intolerable taxations & con∣tributions (towards the paying of his Maiesties debts) which we willingly granted vnto, in hope that the same would at length bee a meanes of vnburthe∣ning vs of our wrongs. This notwithstanding, after our Assembly was broken vp, (by the sollicitation of diuers of the Countries enemies) there could no an∣swere
from his Maiesty be giuen vnto vs, and much lesse any helpe or remedy was to be had therein, but to the contrary, we were rather daily more & more wronged and oppressed, till at the last, when his Im∣periall Maiesty was ready to depart out of the King∣dome, and going forward on his iourney, lay at the Castle of Brandis, (by their procurement) he called one of the Protectors vnto him, Lord Henry Mat∣thias, Earle of Thurin, at that time Burgraue of Car∣listein, &c. and in the presence of two persons said to him, That hee did not acknowledge nor vnder∣stand the three Estates of the reformed Religions petition concerning their grieuances, to be true as they alleadged, and that he had resigned his autho∣rity concerning the protection of their cause vnto the Archbishop of Prague, and that he would be no more troubled therewith. And when the said Earle of Thurin humbly besought his Imperiall Maiesty that he would be pleased not to commit the charge of deliuering that message vnto him, forasmuch as it concerned all the three Estates of the reformed Re∣ligion in generall, desiring his Maiesty that it might please him to giue order to the Lord Chancellor then being, to put the same in writing, and deliuer it vnto him, & he would not faile to beare it vnto them to whom it appertained to deliberate further vpon it: which although his Maiesty granted, and gaue Commission to the said Lord Chancellor to doe it, yet could not the said written resolution from his Maiesty be gotten nor procured from the Chancel∣lour, notwithstanding it had beene often required and sought for at his hands. And besides this, the
Arch-bishop of Prage, commanded the new Church at Cloystergraue (the building whereof cost a great summe of money, and whereunto some of the Electors, Princes of Germany, and other No∣ble-men, had liberally contributed) in contempt of the Gospell to be defaced, throwne downe, vt∣terly spoiled, and laid euen with the ground: And likewise commanded those of Bruna (contrary to the Vnion) to deliuer their Church vnto the Abbot, and not to vse it, and to leaue the keyes thereof in the Chancerie of Bohemia: which because they denyed to doe, and desired that they might still haue the vse thereof, diuers of the principallest persons among them were cited to appeare in the Castle of Prage, and there with great weeping, cry∣ing, and clamour, made by their wiues and chil∣dren, were held prisoners. This being done, in such manner as you haue heard, and among many other things, diuers and sundry grieuances and oppressions in seuerall pla∣ces still were committed and done, and from the said places certified vnto the Protectors, who by the common people were blamed and taxed, and charged not to haue done their best endeuours to let and withstand them: Wee the chiefe Officers, the Kings Maiesties Councell, and Iudges of both Lawes; as also sixe persons out of euery Iurisdiction of the Religion assembled together in Prage at a certaine day thereunto appointed: where being met, we with them, deliberately considering vpon the matter, desiring to proceed peaceably and quietly therein, did nothing else in that Assembly, but one∣ly
agreed, that by submissiue Supplications, one di∣rected to the Regent, the other to his sacred Ma∣iestie, which we sent vnto Viana, we would humbly craue that his Maiestie would bee pleased to stay those violent proceedings, and withall to cause those Citizens of Bruna, that were detained prisoners, to be forthwith released: And to that end also we by writing desired the States of the Marquisdome of Morauia, the Princes and States of vpper and ne∣ther Siletia, and the States of the Marquisdome of higher and lower Lusuitz, being Prouinces incor∣porated vnto this Kingdome, that in submissiue manner they would vouchsafe to petition vnto his sacred Maiestie for vs. Which done, we presently agreed with the Protectors to meet together ano∣ther day, in the Emperor Charles the fourth his Col∣ledge, the Munday after Rogation Sunday last past, about the same matter, if in the meane time we re∣ceiued no answer from his Maiestie of our petition. But vpon the said day, when we met againe, accor∣ding to our determination, we vnderstood, that in all that time there was no answer, touching the same, comne from his Maiesty, and also that our troubles and oppressions were not stayed, nor diminished: but to the contrary, by the meanes, procurements, and malice of our enemies, that his Maiestie had written a sharper letter vnto the Regent, therein not onely blaming the Protectors, but also all vs of the three Estates of the Reformed Religion, willing him to certifie the same vnto the Protectors; the Contents thereof being as followeth. 1 First, that his sacred Maiesty the Emperour
vnderstood, and esteemed, that the same our mee∣ting and Assembly, was wholly done and called, a∣gainst the supreme Authority of his Imperiall and Kingly person. 2 That both the demolishing of the Church in the Citie of Cloystergraue, and the punishing of the disobedient Citizens of the Towne of Bruna, be∣longing to the Cloyster, were both done by his Ma∣iesties owne permission and commandement. 3 That we had proceeded further in those cases, then his Maiesties Letters Patents permitted, or authorized to the States of either of the two Re∣ligions. 4 And lastly, that wee had vsed and retained Strangers in matters vnlawfull, and that we maintai∣ned and defended their open disobedience and mu∣tinies against his Imperiall Maiestie, and sought to support them therein, which his Maiestie did little expect at the hands of some of those that were the Authors of those proceedings. Adding further (that seeing we abused his Ma∣iesties gracious fauour and clemencie, and sought to proceed further in those matters then wee ought) his Maiestie would not faile to looke better into, and to enquire more thereof; and therein to do ius∣tice, and to punish euery one of the Offenders in that manner, according to their deserts: Prohibi∣ting the Defenders in the meane time, vntill his Ma∣iesties returne into that Kingdome; or vpon further order therein by him to be taken, not to summon such meetings any more: Withall, willing the Lord Regent, to certifie and to warne the Townes-men
and Inhabitants, by any meanes, not to appeare vpon any such Summons, nor to ioyne with vs, as in the said Letters more at large appeareth. Which Letter, Wee, the said States, little sus∣pected or expected; much lesse, that by the meanes and crafty instigation of our said Enemies, in stead of obtaining our request, wee should (without hea∣ring) by his Maiestie, be iudged faulty, and forth∣with condemned as guilty, as if the matter or cause were true indeed, as they vpon bad and false information had, by their Writings, informed his Maiestie; perswading themselues that if his Ma∣iestie (maliciously and craftily informed) in his Let∣ters did auouch, and charge vs, that Wee against the Prerogatiue of his sacred Imperiall Person, and Kingly Authoritie, had summoned and called As∣semblies of the Religion together, and that wee maintained forraine Subiects in things vniust, a∣gainst his sacred Maiestie, and likewise vpheld and protected them in their manifest presumptions and conspiracies, against his Imperiall Dignity, and strengthened them therein: which things, in the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome, are expresly (vpon capitall paine and grieuous punishment) pro∣hibited and forbidden. Which although we had not done, and were after∣ward by some of our enemies themselues cleered thereof, before his Imperiall Maiestie; neuerthelesse (being animated thereby, and hauing the Empe∣rours said Letters in their hands, which they caused to be published and read among themselues, in con∣tempt of Vs, and our Religion) they sufficiently
shewed how ready they were, as soone as any of vs should, by course of Law be called in question, for any such cause, before iudgement should passe vpon vs (through malice in their hearts conceiued against vs) to verifie and confirme the same. For it is most certaine, that it was done by them∣selues in their secret Meetings, and that the Letter was penned by them in Prage, and sent vnto his Im∣periall Maiestie to set his hand thereunto: Whereby it is euident, that if wee were to be iudged by them, that to their owne shame and confusion, they could alledge no other thing then this against vs. But when as hitherto they cannot, neither dare openly assault or set vpon vs, yet vnder pretence of Right and Ius∣tice, they seeke to bring vs (that are honest men and his Maiesties true and faithfull Subiects) to sa∣tisfie their pleasures, into vtter ruine, and losse of goods, to the great sorrow and griefe of our wiues, children, and friends, wholly to extinguish our Re∣ligion: And all, whatsoeuer we, by the Kings Ma∣iesties Letters Patents, as also the Concord, Vnion, and Agreement publikely made for our Religion with those of the contrary side in Court of Parlia∣ment, and acknowledged and confirmed to bee a Law and Statute of this Kingdome, wholly to an∣nihilate and ouerthrow, and by that meanes to stop and bar the Protectors, and all of vs, (when any danger were likely to fall vpon vs) from daring to call and assemble vs together, to preuent the same: Then the which, what can be more dangerous and perillous vnto vs? Which troubles, by them craftily brought vpon
vs, and their sinister practices against vs, we seeking to eschew and preuent, when by meanes of their crafty conspiracies, wee could haue no answer from his sacred Imperiall Maiestie of our humble peti∣tions; as also that his Maiestie, by the strange prac∣tices of them, and others their adherents, was so perswaded, that he beleeued all whatsoeuer they falsely deuised and alledged; & would by no meanes credit, nor heare vs speake for our selues: Insomuch as that the very name of the Reformed Religion, and Protectors thereof, was most odious in his Maies∣ties eares, which they themselues lewdly were so bold euery where to boast and brag of. Besides this, as it is euidently knowne to all men, when they would call any honest man in question, they vsed all the meanes they could (though it were against all right, reason, or orderly proceeding) to bring many men, by strange deuices, into the dan∣ger of losse of life and goods; specially, such as were of the Reformed Religion: and by their iudge∣ments and decrees, made black seeme white, and white blacke: the Kings faithfull and true Subiects, disloyall; and his disloyall subiects, iust and true; raysing and aduancing euill and vnfit persons to ho∣nourable Estates and Dignities; and disgracing and defaming such as were worthy of honour and de∣sert; cruelly handling, and strangely dealing with, not onely their owne Subiects, but those also of the Kingdome, as well vnder his Maiesties Dominion, as the Spiritualty, for matters of Religion; and against their wils, cruelly (contrary to the manifest decrees of the Vnion) forced and compelled them
to be of their Papisticall Religion: And by the Kings Iudges menaces and threatnings, brought diuers of the Cities to that point, that they were compelled, that they should no more vnder-write to be obedi∣ent at the Calling and Summons of those of the Reformed Religion, nor any more to assemble and meete together with them; and many other indirect courses. And being asked by vs, whether they them∣selues were the Authors and Deuisers of the Letter, and condemnation afore-said made against vs, they could not deny it. For these causes aforesaid, wee haue proceeded against two of their League and Confederacie: the one called William Slawatam of Chulin, and Cos-chumberk; the other Iawslaws Borzita, of Martinitz, otherwise called Smetsanckii, as perturbers and vio∣laters of the Lawes and common-peace of the Land: who, for that not respecting their Offices wherein they were placed, haue most shamefully and wickedly abused the same, to the great dishonour of his sacred Imperiall Maiestie, our soueraigne Kings authority, & the breach of the peace of this Realme, and haue put both of them together, with the Se∣cretarie their Prouoker, & as it were bondslaue, who with them hath sowne and raised many factions and seditions in the Townes of Prage; hauing first found and proued them to be such persons as in truth they are, according to the old accustomed manner, out of their Offices and Dignities. Against whom cer∣tainely (because they are yet liuing) as also the goods and reuenewes of them, and of all others, that de∣fend and excuse them; or that will taxe, assaile, or ac∣cuse
for the same: and bewale against as many o∣thers, the violaters of the said Letters Patents, and Vnion, as we can by any meanes finde out (special∣ly against Paul Michna, a most wicked, pestiferous man; a Traytor and violater of the Lawes and pub∣like peace of the Land, who from base and meane Parentage, being aduanced to the Secretaries place of the Chancerie in Bohemia, in short time waxt so proud, that he, together with our said Enemies, did vsurpe and take vpon him the whole gouernement and administration in this Kingdome, ouer the States, and made himselfe fellow with the principall Offi∣cers and Iudges of the Land: and despising or con∣temning them, boldly and rashly thrust himselfe in∣to matters which belonged not vnto him, and by de∣ceits & craft wrought many mischiefes in this Land, raised factions, troubles and contentions, and by all the meanes he could, laboured, & sought to bereaue the States of the Reformed Religion of all their Pri∣uiledges, and now is gone and absenteth himselfe out of the Country) whom we will condignely pu∣nish according to his and their deserts. To the which end, for the good of his Imperiall Maiestie, and this Kingdome, our natiue Country, and for the defence of our wiues & children, as also of the whole Realm, from al wrong and mischiefe, we now at this present, assembled our selues in the Castle of Prage, which we haue not done of purpose in any sort to oppose our selues against the authority Royall of his Imperiall Maiestie, our most gracious King, and soueraigne Lord, or to wrong or hurt our louing friends and of the contrary Religion (so they will liue
in peace) sith it is manifestly knowne that hereby no other Secular or Ecclesiasticall person is hurt or hin∣dred, nor any tumult or sedition made, but through∣out all the Townes of Prage, as also throughout the whole Realme, Peace shall be obserued and kept, vnlesse it bee in such causes as are before rehearsed, and not to be auoided, and wherin we neither ought, nor can possibly do lesse then we haue done. Wher∣fore we hope, that his Imperiall Maiesty, our most gracious King and soueraigne Prince, will not other∣wise interpret our meanings and actions, nor giue credit to our slanderous and malicious enemies: Nei∣ther do we think that our fellow-subiects and friends of the contrary Religion, for whatsoeuer wee shall iustly do, or haue done, against those that are viola∣ters and perturbers of the Letters Patents, Coue∣nants, Conditions, Immunities, Peace, and common Vnity of this Realme, or that hereafter shall be done; and much lesse any other, in their owne, or other mens names, either openly or secretly, will for that cause, declare or shew himselfe to be our enemy: But rather hope, that euery man, well weighing, conside∣ring, and calling to minde the reasons and causes aforesaid, and the iust deserts and merits of the said persons, as also that our meaning and intent is not, nor neuer was, in the least manner, or in any sort, to do any thing against the Emperours Maiestie, our most gracious soueraigne Kings authority, or against the Romish Religion, and the Vnion betweene vs made; will not onely excuse, but also take part with vs, and aide vs (in all things that concerne the preser∣uation of the Priuiledges and Immunities of this
Realme, together with the concord and mutuall loue, peace, and amity thereof) against all those that with∣stand it. Therefore wee most humbly beseech his Imperiall Maiestie, our most gracious King and so∣ueraigne Prince, that it would please him (if need shall require) to publish another, and more large Apologie, for our excuse and iustification vnto the world. Giuen in the Castle of Prage, in our common Assembly, vpon Friday, next after the Feast of the Ascension of our Lord Iesus Christ. Ann. 1618. Reasons whereby it is shewed and proued, that the peo∣ple of Bohemia, that are Subiects to the Monasteries and Clergie of the same Realme, in their resorts, by the Letters Patents, and the Vnion, contracted and made betweene those of the Reformed Religion, and the Papists, haue liberty to build themselues Churches, and freely to exercise their Religion therein, without interruption. 1 FIRST, it is declared, and expresly set down in his Maiesties Letters Patents, that all the vnited members of the Reformed Religion, viz. the Lords, and Knights, as also those of Prage, Ruttenbergh, and other Townes, together with their Subiects; and, briefely, all those that make profession of, and acknowledge the Bohemian Con∣fession, no man excepted, shall and may freely and peaceably in all places, exercise their Christian Religion of communicating vnder both kinds, ac∣cording
to the said Confession, and the Vnity made, and shall be suffered quietly to professe and confesse their faith and Religion without interruption. 2 That from the day of the date thereof, none of the superiour free Estates, nor any of the Cities, Townes, nor Country people shall, neither by their Magistrates, nor any other person whatsoeuer, Spiri∣tuall or Temporall, be troubled for their said Reli∣gion, neither by force or violence be constrained or compelled to exercise the contrary Religion by any meanes whatsoeuer. 3 Thirdly, that against the said Priuiledge, no Counter-mand, nor any other prohibition which may in any sort be, or procured, the least impediment or alteration thereof, from his Imperiall Maiestie, his Heires and Successors, Kings of Bohemia, shall not be made nor granted: and if any such thing shall happen, or be enterprised and taken in hand by any one, it shall be of no force nor vigour; neither shall there be any further pursuite thereof made in Law, or otherwise directly or indirectly whatsoeuer. 4 That his Imperiall Maiestie certifieth and gi∣ueth all supreme Officers, both present and future, to vnderstand, that it is his will and pleasure, that the Barons, Knights, Townes of Prage, Ruttenbergh, and other places, together with all their Subiects; and namely, all those that professe the Reformed Religi∣on, and acknowledge the Bohemian Confession, by vertue of his Maiesties Letters Patents, shall be suf∣fered and permitted by them, and euery of them, freely to enioy all the Articles, Clauses, and Sen∣tences therein set downe and declared, and no hin∣derance,
let, nor interruption to be done vnto them for the same, by any man; but to the contrary, that they shall aide, helpe, & assist them therein to the vt∣termost of their powers: And if it shall happen that any Spirituall, or Temporall person shall doe any thing contrary to his said Maiesties Letters, or to the end thereby to disanull or interrupt the same, his said Maiestie shall and will, as also his Heires and Successors, Kings of Bohemia, and the States of this Realme, euery one of them for their parts, pro∣ceed against euery such persons, as against pertur∣bators of the common Peace and Tranquillity of the Law, and will defend and protect the said States of the Reformed Religion, in all respects, as the Articles in the Statute of the Vnion con∣cerning the peace of the Land, containe and im∣port. 5. And in the Articles of Vnion between both the religions, for the better explaning of the Letters Pa∣tents, as also in the Exchequer or Office of the Rowls or Records of the Realme, in Quaterno Emptionum ar∣genteo, Anno 1609. it is inserted in these words, That in such places or Cities vnder the Kings, Queenes, or the Emperors Maiesties regiment, those of the re∣formed Religion, that haue not their owne particu∣lar Churches, places of burial, nor any places among those of the contrary religion, by vertue of his Maie∣sties Letters Patents, shall haue power to make and prepare Churches, Hospitals, and Burying places for themselues whensoeuer they will. 6. In the coniunction of the States of the Religi∣on in Bohemia, and the Papists, with the Princes and
States of the Dutchy of Silesia, these words are in∣serted. Whosoeuer, vnlesse it be the Emperors Ma∣iesty himselfe, (whether he be a Spirituall, or a Tem∣porall person, of what dignity or condition soeuer, none excepted) eyther in his Imperiall Maiesties name, his owne, or any others whatsoeuer, shall goe about, or attempt to trouble or molest the Lords of the three Estates of the Crowne of Bohemia, or the Princes and States of Silesia, or Slesia, that are of the Ausburge Confession, or any of the Subiects of the same profession, whether they be vnder Spiritual or Temporall, Catholike or Euangelicall iurisdicti∣on in their Christian religion, Churches, Scholes, or Consistories, in any manner, or vnder any pretence whatsoeuer of right belonging before to the Catho∣like foundatiōs, Cloysters, Churches, Scholes, Con∣sistories, Rents, In-comes, or Reuenues, and now at this present are vsed and enioyed by these of the re∣formed Religion in both countries, and still remaine so, and would molest them for the same, it shall bee lawfull for all the sayd States of the reformed Reli∣gion, to ioyne and stand fast altogether, and to doe their vttermost endeuour to the last drop of bloud in their bodies, for the defence of the reformed Re∣ligion, Churches, Scholes & Consistories, and their appurtenances, and to hold and keepe the same for their security: And that whensoeuer they or any of their subiects or others of their profession, that are vnder temporall or spiritual iurisdiction, as aforesaid, are troubled or vexed, or by any Magistrate assaul∣ted or assailed violently, vnder, or by what meanes or pretence soeuer it be, as if they were seditious &
Rebels, or otherwise, (as the enemies of God and his Word are wont to doe, and daily practise the same, as we commonly see.) The said three Estates of the reformed Religion in the Kingdome of Bohemia, vp∣on the first motion thereof made vnto them by the Princes & States of Silesia, within one month then next after ensuing, shall leuie one thousand horse∣men, & two thousand footmen; at the second time, the like number; and at the third time, all the forces in Silesia, to aide and assist them: and the like shall be done by the Princes and States of Silesia, in the Bohemians behalfe, if need require. Which their said coniunction, action, and vnity, his Impe∣riall Maiesty shall fully & euidently confirm & allow. 7. In his Maiesties Letters Patents giuen & gran∣ted to those of Silesia, it is likewise expresly sig∣nified and set downe, that all the Subiects of the Prouinces of Silesia, whether they be vnder Spiritual or Temporall Princes, Commanders, or hereditary Princes of Dutchies, Cities, Townes and Villages, and other Magistrates, none excepted, shall be there∣in comprehended, in these words: That none of them, whether they liue vnder spirituall or temporall power & iurisdiction, shall be compelled to vse any other religion then that they professe, neyther shall bee sent away, or banished from his dwelling place, nor put from his office or dignity for religion, or in any sort vexed, molested or troubled for his consci∣ence. These Letters Patents granted to Silesia, were af∣ter ours, and by vs and our meanes proceeded, ney∣ther
were they largelier made to them, then to vs, nor vnto vs then to them; & yet we as the superior mem∣bers, cannot be of worse or meaner condition: be∣sides this, the Articles in our Letters Patents, are ge∣nerally & compendiously contained, but in the Sile∣sian Patent, more expresly and particularly declared. 8. At the making of his Maiesties Letters Patents touching the Vnion, it was not otherwise meant nor intended, then that the Cloysters are his Imperiall Maiesties princely goods and reuenues, and that he, as the superior, hath ful power ouer them, as it is suffi∣ciently knowne vnto them that then were present at the time of the making of the contract. 9. That in the Kingdome of Bohemia, the Spiri∣tualty haue no singular state as those of Morauia and other Prouinces haue, neyther haue any voyce in Parliament, but are distinguished & ordered by the Emperors Maiesty among the other States, in all things concerning them. 10. That all Ecclesiasticall goods be of the Arch∣bishopricke, as also of all the rest by superior right, & are vnder the power and disposition of the Kings of Bohemia, as the highest and supremest founders and Patrones thereof. 11. That the same Ecclesiasticall goods by the Statutes of the Land, D. 40. belong to the Kings Ex∣chequer or reuenew; wherefore, according to a Sta∣tute of the Realm, Anno 11. no Colledge nor Cloy∣ster, without the Kings cōsent, can alienate or change any thing belonging thereunto, and if they do pawn, sell, change, or alienate any thing thereof, it shall be of no force, and that whosoeuer doth take any thing
of them in that sort, he shall restore the same againe freely vnto the King, or to any other to whom it shall please the King to appoint him to doe it. 12. That Spirituall men are feodaries and admi∣uistrators of their temporal goods, only for their life∣time, and so they ought to vnderstand it; for that the Kings of Bohemia alwaies had right and power ouer their spirituall goods, to sell the same vnto any of the inhabitants of the Land, without the consent of the said Spirituall persons, and to alienate and make them hereditary, and to record them for such in the Records of the Exchequer or Rowles: whereof many examples are extant in the reignes of Ferdinando, Maximilian, and Rodulphus, Emperours and Kings of Bohemia.
