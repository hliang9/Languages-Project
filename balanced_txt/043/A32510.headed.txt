DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms By the King. A PROCLAMATION For Suppressing the Printing and Publishing Unlicensed News-Books, and Pamphlets of News. CHARLES R. WHereas it is of great Importance to the State, That all News Printed and Published to the People, as well concerning Foreign, as Domestick Affairs, should be agreeable to Truth, or at least Warranted by good Intelligence, that the minds of His Majesties Subjects may not be disturbed, or amused by Lies or vain Reports, which are many times raised on purpose to Scandalize the Government, or for other indirect Ends; And whereas of late many Evil-disposed Persons have made it a common Practice to Print and Publish Pamphlets of News, without License or Authority, and therein have vended to His Majesties People, all the idle and malicious Reports that they could Collect or Invent, contrary to Law; The coutinuance whereof would in a short time endanger the Peace of the Kingdom, the same manifestly tending thereto, as has been declared by all His Majesties Iudges unani∣mously: His Majesty therefore considering the great Mischief that may ensue upon such Li∣cencious and Illegal Practices, if not timely prevented, hath thought fit by this His Royal Proclamation (with the Advice of His Privy Council) strictly to Prohibit and Forbid all Per∣sons whatsoever to Print or Publish any News-Books, or Pamphlets of News not Licensed by His Majesties Authority. And to the intent all Offenders may know their Danger, and desist from any further Proceedings of this kind, His Majesty is Graciously pleased hereby to Declare, That they shall be proceeded against according to the utmost Severity of the Law: And for that purpose, His Majesty doth hereby Will and Command all His Iudges, Iusti∣ces of Peace, and all other His Officers and Ministers of Iustice whatsoever, That they take effectual Care, that all such as shall Offend in the Premisses, be proceeded against, and punished according to their Demerits. Given at Our Court at Whitehall this 12th day of May, in the Two and thirtieth year of Our Reign. God save the King. London, Printed by John Bill, Thomas Newcomb, and Henry Hills, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Majesty. 1680.
