The Famous HISTORY OF Auristella, Originally Written By Don Gonsalo de Cepedes. TOGETHER With the Pleasant STORY OF PAUL of Segovia, BY Don Francisco de Quevedo. Translated from the Spanish LONDON, Printed for Joseph Hindmarsh, Book∣seller to his Royal Highness, at the Black Bull in Cornhil, 1683.
To the Honourable Lady, Henrietta Grenvile. Madam, THIS little piece of the growth of Spain, was plea∣sing to me in the reading it; and having too much leasure now, I took the pains to make it speak En∣glish; and when I had done it, I had an inspired thought (on some previous Discourses of your Noble Family, and particularly of your self) to present it to you; supposing as it could add little to your better diversions; yet at least it could take little from them;
besides I had Presidents from others, who have done some∣thing of like nature, Dedica∣ted to Persons of Quality to manifest their respects and ser∣vice to them. Thus encou∣raged in this attempt by such examples, I durst publickly prefix your Ladiship, for such a Patroness so Honourable by Descent, and so fam'd for In∣genuity: For you Madam, to the invincible Courage and Conduct of your Heroick An∣cestors (some whereof worthi∣ly knew how to make an Alli∣ance between the Laurel and Olive, as a living Branch of their Illustrious Stem) have added to their Renown, that
Sweetness, Beauty and Inge∣nuity, which eminently have influenced all who have had the honour to be well-acquaint∣ed with you, to esteem and re∣view you for them. That sin∣gular Virtue you are Mistriss of, obliges me among others to pay you this Homage, which I humbly supplicate you would vouchsafe to accept, as coming from a person that loves and honours you with all his heart; desiring that you would par∣don my confidence in this Ad∣dress, which sprang from the observation I have made and heard of your Goodness and excellent Merits; at least that you would be pleas'd to
connive at my boldness to De∣dicate this Trifle to kiss your hands; thereby imitating that Roman Emperor's meekness, who dain'd to accept of a Cup of Water from a poor Woman that in humility presented it: I am loth to tire you with rea∣ding of my zeal to serve you; (for I have not Rhetoric enough to express your Praises) and therefore I hasten to tell you, that I remain with a particu∣lar reverence, as being one who counts it his highest ho∣nour to publish himself. Madam, Your Ladiships affectionate Kinsman, and most humble Servant, W. B.
The Famous HISTORY OF Auristella. THE City of Se∣ville, the renown∣ed and Opulent Emporium of all Spain, gave me Birth, to which my Father retired
and settled ever since he had solemniz'd the Marriage with my Mother, whose Fa∣ther was honourable and rich, and had left her at his Death a considerable For∣tune, which he had acqui∣red by the many important Emploies in his Majesties Service in that eminent Port, where they passed ma∣ny years in Love and Splen∣dor, until my unfortunate Self was born, being the last and onely Surviving Off∣spring from their Marriage Bed. My Name Philan∣der, so called in remem∣brance of my Mothers Fa∣ther, whose Name was Phi∣lander
de Taurello's— My Mother (whome I merited not to know) be∣ing dead through the un∣happy Travil she suffered in bringing me into the world, I remained from my tender Infancy subject to such In∣commodities, wherewith such are most commonly brought up with, who are deprived of their Maternal care and kindnesses; altho' that misfortune was in some measure repayed by the Education which I had in the Noble Family of Cosmos my Father. But the ten∣der love which he had for my Mother, so much aug∣mented
that loss and his af∣fliction, that he could re∣ceive no comfort, notwith∣standing the assiduous Arti∣fices of his best friends to ef∣fect it; insomuch, that this fatal Blow at once took from him all Joy, Health and Tranquillity of Mind, and made him a deplorable Picture of Tears and Grief. But at lenth, observing that the highest part of his mise∣ry was caused by continu∣ing in that same place, where had passed his Youth in the enjoyment of his Dearest Spouse: he resolved and prepared to remove from all that did so continually
torment his Memory; and to leave the Kingdom of Spain his once so beloved Country, selling some of his Estate which he conver∣ted into money, and lea∣ving the rest towards the support and maintenance of me his Son: he embar∣qued on a Man of War bound for Ostend in Flanders, whi∣ther in few daies the favou∣rable Winds brought him; but 'ere he went he com∣mitted me to the Conduct of one of my Uncles, who was his Brother. My Fa∣thers health was wholly re∣stored him in that Foreign Country, where we heard
he lived so content and ho∣nourable, that we lost all hopes of seeing him again; not doubting but that he would forget those regards which his proper Bloud might almost challenge from him, by the increase of his Fortune and Honour, if Providence had not alte∣red his design in the man∣ner I am about to describe. A Gentleman of Quality of the Kingdom of Castile, a Native of the City of To∣ledo, whose Name was Lo∣renzo D'spado, having spent a considerable Fortune which he possessed, had re∣duced his honoorable Fami∣ly
to that extream want, that it had scarcely where∣with to subsist: at length he resolved, (hoping to raise his Fortune in another Country, and to avoid the troublesome disgraces in his own) to take the same Voiage as my father did, leaving, however with ma∣ny sentiments of sorrow the company of his dear Wife, and his beautiful young Daughter, whose name was Auristella, his chiefest Joy. Yet his Wifes and her Tears and Sighs (which might have softned Marble) could not change his resolution; therefore they must submit
to this Voyage and the loss of his company for the space of ten years, which he deter∣mined to stay from them. As he had but little of his Estate left, yet what remai∣ned he gave for the use of of his Wife and Daughter, and requested them to be advised in all their Affairs by his antient and faithful servant Andreo Scordos, (a Biscaner by Birth) who was likewise his Kinsman, and one whom he loved as en∣tirely as if he had been his son, and in whom he had great reason to confide, which was the greatest com∣fort he was able to frame to
his discomposed thoughts in those great afflictions. His good Fortune or my unhappy Star rather, gui∣ded him (when landed in Flanders) to go to Brussels, having changed his name as is customary with the Spa∣niards, when they are in Fo∣reign Lands; who also are wont to conceal their Qua∣lities that they may be indu∣ced to seek a maintenance most profitable. He Arrived about the time my fathers Lieutenant Collonel was slain, and my father being then at Brussels, and acciden∣tally meeting Lorenzo D'spado, (who being educated toge∣ther in their Youth at Sala∣manca)
both were surpri∣sed to see each other; and after many generous and af∣fectionate Congratulations, made friendly enquiries of each others condition; which being fully made known; my father, by the great inte∣rest his good fortunes had acquired him from the no∣ble Governour of those Pro∣vinces, quickly got his favou∣rable consent, that Lorenzo should be his Lieutenant Collonel, representing him to be of a noble Extraction, and one that was fitly qua∣lified for such a Command. It so happened, that Loren∣zo D'spado soon got great
honour by his prudent Con∣duct, having also an Of∣fice conferred on him, by which he grew very rich in few years. But at length the Air of that Country not agreeing with his health, and above all desiring to return to his dear Country of Spain; he one day took an occasion to tell my father the resoluti∣on which he had taken. It is difficult to express the grief my father had in the fear to lose so gallant a Companion and antient a friend, when he was infor∣med of his intended return, therefore he made his
chiefest prayers and appli∣cations to him, that he would not leave those parts, and conferred about the best waies and means to re-esta∣blish his health. Besides, he made use of many Arti∣fices and plausible pretences whatever he could invent to alter his resolution, and perswade his stay; but all in vain, for Lorenzo, who could never appear insensi∣ble of the many graces he had received from the Go∣vernour, and other Nobles of that Country, as well as from my father, thought that it was now high time no longer to disguise the
reasons that further obliged him to return, and for some time to quit his Emploies. The most important were to see his dear Wife and Daughter, and to retrieve an antient Estate, which had been mortgaged, and would be forfeited, and therefore it was fit to get that and o∣ther things settled to his li∣king, and for the good of his family; and when his health permitted he would again return to Flanders. Those reasons were so e∣vident that my father had nothing to reply, which did not only satisfie, but also for a particular love to his
company, made him him∣self to think of returning to; considering also, that in his heart the love for his own family and Country did not a little oblige him to do so, having now also got a fair Fortune to make him the more welcome. Thus concerting their in∣terest, love to their Fami∣lies, and the high esteem of each others Company, they both resolv'd to leave Flan∣ders; which that they might do with all possible Honour and Respect, they both took leave of that Court, which did dispense with their just and important reasons for
some time; so they both prepared together to ship at Ostend, from whence after a happy Navigation, they arriv'd at the famous Port of San Lucar, where all the Relations of my Father went to meet him, having receiv'd Letters of Advice by the Post to that purpose. But e're they came to Land, my Father had entertained Lo∣renzo with his fervent De∣sires to coment their friend∣ship, that it might be never altered; and just before they left the Ship, he took occa∣sion to speak to him in these terms. I do not doubt (dear friend) but that you are sa∣tisfied
of my Friendship, as I am assured of yours, there∣fore I much wish that our separation may not lessen it, and nothing in the World may be capable to destroy it. And to perpetuate it, I have meditated one expedi∣ent (if you please to approve it) that it may be eternal, which is to make an Alli∣ance between us by the marriage of your Daughter to my Son, if it has pleas'd Heaven to let them live which we now at our land∣ing shall quickly know) You see I communicate to you the inmost recesses of my Soul, and it will be
your part now to let me frankly know your resolu∣tion herein. Lorenzo an∣swered him with tears of joy, which evidenced the consent of his heart to his Proposals, and soon grant∣ed him his Daughter, which he demanded for me; pro∣testing to him that he was master of his Life, Honour & of his good Fortune; and so they fell to embrace each other. That done, they both came on shore, where my Kindred and my self, who were all ready come to San Lucar, in expectati∣on of him, saluted them with much joy; my Father
having been wanting four∣teen years, and I then but six when he quitted Spain and went for Flanders. My Father having taken solemn leave of Lorenzo, was impatient of all delaies that might obstruct his see∣ing his ancient place of Re∣sidence; and we came to Seville, to the unspeakable satisfaction of our Friends and Relations. My Father told me of the Marriage he had agreed on for me, which I disposed my self to obey with all Pleasure and De∣light, and had prepared my self accordingly for my de∣parture, to wait on the fair
Auristella, my intended Wife. In few dayes after a Courier was sent from Lo∣renzo (as was agreed he should) to advertise that he was safely come to his own abode at Toledo. Who can imagine the mutual joyes of his Wife, Daughter, and Friends, for his safe return; but surely mine were not less than theirs, especially since the Messenger had re∣presented to me the incom∣parable Qualities and Vir∣tues of Auristella; and that she was the most renowned Beauty of all Castile, which made me believe I should never soon enough see the
hour of my departure for Toledo. He gave an account also, by his Letter, that he found to his extream con∣tent, his Wife and Daughter in perfect health. He gave them also an account how he had spent his time, and what great Honours he had attained in his Travails, and of the Marriage that was concerted with my Father, which was received with the general applause of his Fa∣mily, Kindred, and Friends, who were resolved to make honourable preparations for all things necessary for our Marriage. And now the time of my departure being
come, I had my Fathers Blessing, and went to take leave of one of my intimate & particular Friends, named Bennato, of whom I shall speak more in the pursuit of this Discourse, then ta∣king Post, with some of my People, I arrived in four daies at the renowned City of Toledo, and went strait to my Mistresses Father's House; I had no sooner quitted my Stirrup, but in∣stead of finding all the Joy and Welcome I expected, I saw nothing but an ex∣tream confusion, and abun∣dance of Tears, Sadness and Grief, which infinitely sur∣prised
me, although I were received with many marks of satisfaction, my presence seeming an evident Conso∣lation to that afflicted Fa∣mily, from whom I was im∣mediately informed; (shew∣ing me the Body of Andres their antient Domestick ser∣vant the Biscaner (whom I before mentioned) which was extended on a black Cloth, pierced with five cruel Wounds; which Bo∣dy was found near the Gate of their House that very morning, wrapped up in bloody Linnen, without knowing or imagining who how or when it was put
into that deplorable state, al∣though they used all possi∣ble diligence to discover the Author of his Death: They related to me the friendship that Lorenzo had for him, the confidence he had in him, the good service he had done, and particularly during his absence; that I could not condemn the re∣sentments of his unfortu∣nate End, nor the strange reception I found. This oc∣casioned hower the delay of our Marriage for two daies, which seemed so many long years; for having seen the fair Auristella, and enjoyed her lovely society, my de∣sires
were inflamed with greater violence. At last, the happy day was come, and the night so mutually desired; But alas! no sooner was I faln asleep, but the hands and cries of Auristella awakened me in a strange afright, lowdly calld me to the assistance of her Fathers House, which at the same time was consuming by dreadful flames: I ha∣stily put on my Gown, and immediately ran from my Apartment, being lighted by the sparkling Flames that this pitiless Element sent up∣wards to its Sphear; then running to the place where
they appeared most violent, I met Lorenzo, his Wife and others of the Family; and in a moment (the Bell gi∣ving the occustomed Sig∣nal) all the Neighbourhood being alarmed, came and used all possible diligence to put some stop to the force of the Fire. All the House being filled with noises and cries, in that confusion I saw and heard my Auristel∣la, my greatest and chiefest care in this misfortune was for her, to whom I came, being called by the sad Ec∣choes of her Sighs; I found her in a Swoon, between the arms of her loving Mo∣ther
near to a deep Well, where all the servants were, which redoubled my affli∣ctions, when they told me that the cause of that mor∣tal Aecident was no less do∣lorous than the death of the miserable Biscaner; and that a young Damosel, named Mariana, servant to Auri∣stella (employing her self among the rest to draw wa∣ter out of the Well to give it to others to quench the Fire) was faln into it in the sight of her Mistris, and was therein drowned before she could be taken up, but when with much adoe she was taken out, it did so
much augment the Tears of the Mother and Daughter, who loved her dearly, ha∣ving bred her in their ser∣vice from her Childhood, that nothing was able to comfort them; and I could add less consolation to them than others in the pitiful E∣state which these sad adven∣tures had reduced me to. In fiine, Time which is a Grand Master, heald all these troubles though they still seemed present to my remembrance as sad Augu∣ries and unhappy Presages of our Marriage. Having passed some months at Toledo, I recei∣ved
Letters from my Fa∣ther to require my return, and Auristella took leave of her Parents. (which was not performed without many Tears) We set forwards, and Bennato with us, who re∣turned from the Court to Seville, from whence he went about the same time as I did; he came very op∣portunely, and was so kind as to keep us company, by which means our Journey seemed very agreeable. At length we came to my Fa∣thers House, where we were expected with much impa∣tience, by whom and our Kindred we were received
with many marks of the greatest welcome, which much contributed to mode∣rate the griefs which Auri∣stella by being now remo∣ved from her own Parents. We had convenient Lodg∣ings assigned us, where we were daily visited by my dear Friend Bennato: I li∣ved so contented a life with my dear Auristella, that I could hardly consent to be one moment from her; but the Fates envying my Re∣pose, permitted me not lon∣ger to enjoy the pleasures which I had done above four years past. The friend∣ship which was contracted
between Bennato and my self was so great, that seldome a day passed without an in∣terview; he coming to me or I to him, and we lived with such conformity as if we had lain in the same Belly, and been nourished with the same Bloud. But one day that Bennato could not meet me, nor I him, (being as it were jealous of each other, attributing it to some neglect) which would at the same time give some marks of our careful respect; and seeing it was late, I re∣solved to wait for him at his Lodging, and he at the same time came to mine,
with design not to stir from thence till I returned. Auristella, who was indi∣sposed, kept her Bed, near whom Bennato staid expect∣ing my return, whilst I wea∣ry with expectation of him, at length came home, re∣mitting my Visit to some other time: But finding the Door shut, (which was never done when I was a∣broad) I knockt several times e're it was opened. I must protest that this gave me some slight suspition; I drew near to a little Crany, which appeared through the ill-joyned Boards, to see or hear what passed in the
House; would Heaven had rather made me blind than permitted me to have had such a Curiosity! I saw a Slave descending, carrying a man on his shoulders to∣wards the Garden-door, where leaving him, he came and opened that at which I stood. One may judg of the trouble and alteration that this sight gave me: I no sooner entred, but I ran to the Garden, where I per∣ceived a man to hide him∣self among the Myrtles, which more than my Tran∣sport was the cause of his Death. For being not well able to put himself in a po∣sture
of Defence, nor disen∣gage himself from the Bran∣ches of the Trees; I with my drawn Sword gave him three thrusts through the Body, e're I could (through excess of my blind passion) observe that he called me by my name, or tell me who he was. At length falling at my feet, I obser∣ved it was my intimate and faithful Bennato, whom I had treated with this inhu∣mane severity. I was so surprised, that I remained dying as he, who with a fee∣ble voice requested me to cause a Confessor to come unto him. I had lost all
sense knowing the Crime I had committed, and could not but with some pain hearken to his last words, which proved his Innocence and my Injustice. My dear Philander, (said he) is it possible that Heaven should consent, that the Sword of my best Friend should give my mortal Wound? In what has your Benna∣to offended, that you with so much cruelty should re∣solve to avenge your self? But I wrongfully complain against you; I forgive you my Death, it was a scruple ill-grounded that I had, that being alone near Auristella,
(and your Door being shut) you might not suspect her hnour or my fidelity, which I call Heaven to Witness, has alwaies been for you in∣violable—Death gave him no more time, but shut his Eyes; he yielded up his Soul within my arms. I know not how, that mine took not the same way, be∣ing so oppressed with Grief and Repentance. I was at length constrain'd to quit this unfortunate Corps, and went to Auristellas Apart∣ment, where I found her not, nor in all the House, through which I heard nothing but the cries of her Maids, who
were seeking their Mistress, when suddenly one of them told me she had cast her self (in her Shift) out of the win∣dow into the street, having been inform'd of the death of innocent Bennato, fearing that in my furious indigna∣tion, I might not give her time to justifie her self. That same Maid related also to me, how Auristella had o∣blig'd him to do what he did, because that hearing of the knocks I gave at the Gate (which one of my peo∣ple had shut unawares) she apprehended that I would enter into some just suspiti∣on of her. Ah! dear Bennato,
said she, wherefore did your prudence permit it self to be governed by the ill ground∣ed fears of a Woman? I was a thousand times about to take vengeance on my self, of the tragical end of my friend, but Heaven thought it not fit, that it might re∣serve me for something more cruel. I could not yet have any news of Auristella, whom I sought in vain, therefore I concluded 'twas best for me to hide my self; so leaving the House in that confusion, (as cannot easily be imagined) I went to the Convent of the Carthusian
Fathers, who recieved me with all possible humanity, and secur'd my unhappy Life, which has been desti∣ned to infinite troubles, a thousand times worse than death it self; I was private∣ly visited by my particular friends, who took all ima∣ginable pains to represent my innocence, and procure my pardon. Auristella was retired to a Nunnery, as soon as she re∣covered her fall into the street, which was not with∣out much hurt, and with some difficulty first got, as well as she could, to a House which she saw open, and
there discovered to the ma∣ster what she was, who cha∣ritably received her. But the next morning they were informed with what dili∣gence the Officers of Justice searched after her and me, and therefore they thought it convenient to lead her to a Nunnery. I had no∣tice thereof all most as soon as it was done, which gave me as much comfort as I was capable to recieve, but Heaven would not that I should long have it, and I was but at the beginning of my miseries. All these mortal discon∣tents so strongly seiz'd on
Auristellas heart (together, with the dismal bruises she receiv'd by her fall) that she fell into a great sickness, her memory perpetually tor∣menting her, with the con∣sideration to find her self exposed to the evil tongues of the people, guessing at what risque her Honour and Reputation was subjected; so that in few dayes there was a period put to her un∣happy Life. But first she ap∣plied her self to the superior of that Nunnery, to whom she gave sealed, written with her own hand, and reque∣sted that it might be instant∣ly delivered unto me; I re∣ceived
it about the same time as I heard of the deplo∣rable news of her death. Nothing is capable to ex∣press the griefs of my Soul, the alination of its Faculties, and the subversion of my Senses: I was a long time (as it were) hovering be∣twixt death and life, which was protracted onely to bring eternal afflictions on me. And to conclude this mournful Discourse, be∣hold what remains to be further known in the pro∣per terms of the Letter to me.
Auristella to Philander. THE Day is come (my Dear Philander) on which I must pay to Death an inevitable Debt: 'Tis an execution of that rigour, which no person can be ex∣empted from. Although I have resentments of all that humane weakness can on such occasions pro∣duce; he who stands ready to be my Judg, truly knows that the greatest torment which I suffer, is to be se∣parated from your amiable Company; and my chiefest sadness, is not able once
more to see you, to bid you farewel, to clear up your su∣spitions, and to assure you of my fidelity; which has been inviolable, ever since the happy day of our Mar∣riage, to the last moment of my Life. And since I am come to the time to speak the truth which relates to the Eternal Salvation of my Soul. It is but just dear Phi∣lander, that you be infor∣med as well as the whole world, of a Secret which I have so long concealed to the prejudice of my Con∣science. Read carefully this Letter, and you will pardon my offence, (if it be true
that it was done against your Honour) to have done a thing which was executed against my consent, against my will, and before vve vvere married. I persvvade my self that you vvill do Ju∣stice to my Innocence, that my Reputation be not stai∣ned either before you, or before those vvho shall have notice of my misfortune. I doubt not but you still remember the unhappiness which so much afflicted our Family on the day you came to Toledo, which pos∣sibly might prognosticate the present disgraces. You may call to mind also the
diligence which was used to find the Assassinate of our Andreo the Biscaner, which then proved unsuccessful; and still might be so to the Day of the last Judgment, if this which is my last did not oblige me to declare, and protest that my unhappy Self was his Murdress; his infamous Treachery will I hope obtain my pardon at the Sovereign Tribunal, next to my extream and hearty repentance for my sins. Know then dear Philander, that no sooner had the Bis∣caner been informed of my Fathers Return; and that our Marriage was conclu∣ded
on, but he fell sick of a Feaver, which in the begin∣ning seemed very dange∣rous: my Parents who lo∣ved him as their own Child, procured the most renown∣ed Phisitians of the City to attend him, who could find no remedy that could re∣lieve him, and said his Ma∣lady proceeded from an ex∣cess of Melancholy, which made our whole Family ve∣ry mournful for him. The Night before you came thi∣ther, he made me know (to my utter ruine) what it was that reduced him to that miserable condition —
It was about Midnight (yet I was not asleep) that I heard some walking in my Chamber, where to my sorrow I was that Night without a Bed-fellow, and opening the Curtains of my Bed, I saw our sick Biscaner appear, whom I supposed to have some Delirium by the excess of his Feaver: and I not seeming to be angry for his audacious coming into my Chamber (and so late at night when I was laid in Bed) spoke to him in as af∣fable a manner as if I had been his Sister, and far (Hea∣ven knows) from suspect∣ing any ill design against
me. But he with a profound sigh, looking on me with a furious eye, spake to me in these Terms— It is most certain Auri∣stella, that the grief I feel can have no remedy but from your hands, in which is my Life: You have obli∣gations enough which I hope will deter you from being ungrateful to me for the good offices and servi∣ces I have rendred you, and in a time too, when your cruel Father treated me with so much rigour. I waited not for a requital of the pains I took in your Educa∣tion, nor of that which I
suffered in his absence, to∣wards the subsistance of his Family, with honour; all which I did with a kind of delight and satisfaction; in hopes nevertheless of some acknowledgment; at least to have granted me to pass my remaining daies in the beloved Company of the fair Auristella, which Joy I am about to be deprived of with so much Injustice. This therefore is my great∣est Malady, which encreases in proportion to the ap∣proaching time, to see you in the power of another: Wherefore I come resolv'd, not to leave your Chamber
without the recovery of my health, & assurance that you shall be mine: If I lose my Life, let me be your Hus∣band first, for just Heaven has reserved that Honour and good Fortune for me alone. I expect no other answer from you, but the giving me your hand: You cannot defer it, nor do I fear you are able to find the means to avoid it, since the accomplishment of my de∣sires is now in my power; for I will deprive you of Life with this Poniard in the same instant, that you shall make the least resistance to give me satisfaction. So he
took his Poniard from his Cincture, which he presen∣ted to my Throat▪ which so much affrighted me, that it was a long time e're my Tongue could pronounce any thing; sometimes con∣sidering the peril of my Ho∣nour, and then I was sur∣prised with excess of fear of my death, which is natural to our Sex; which made me thoughtful either to avoid my Death, or put my Cha∣stity out of danger. To di∣vert his resolution without reproaching his Treachery, I endeavoured to sweeten him by the tendrest Words could utter, and promised
him with a thousand Oaths I would be his Wife; and believing that he would at present content himself by my permitting him my hand (as he at first demand∣ed) I gave it him, but he no sooner had it, e're I found my self drawn into his arms, and my strength failing me in the affright I was in, I could not prevent his dispo∣sal of me as he pleased: But just Heaven (to which all the complaints of my afflicted Soul ascended) did not per∣mit the chastisement which this offence and Treachery merited to be long deferred, for he received it from my
own hands with his own proper Poniard. The re∣sentment of my shame ani∣mating my weakness with an undaunted courage. As soon as I found him fast a∣sleep I took my revenge, and seizing of that fatal Wea∣pon which before had over∣awed me — I thrust it through his heart, and by many other stabs, which I redoubled, I made a large gap for his perfidious Soul to pass; and without being heard, I wrapt his misera∣ble Corps in my sheets drencht in his own Bloud, and dragg'd it out, and left it near to our House. This
was not the end of my dis∣graces, for when I saw you come they did afresh renew; and if I had not been pre∣vented by the fears of pu∣nishment in another world, I had made the same Sacri∣fice of my own life; because I was afraid, and did believe I could never hide my in∣famy from you. But in this desperate imagination, I found some comfort in thinking that Mariana might be now very useful to me, who having been bred up with me from her Infancy, bore part in my most secret thoughts and actions; & yet I knew not how to declare
to her what was come to pass, till the fatal Melan∣cholly into which I was plunged, and in a time when I should shew the greatest joy, gave her the first occa∣sion to ask who did conjure me, with much earnestness, to let her know the true cause of it, so that I saw my self obliged to tell her all without disguising the least particular, and being not able, but by her means to find any remedy for my af∣fliction; I put my life and honour into her hands, and after I had importuned her by all that I found the most powerful and sacred
to perswade her; (as much as my necessity and the time would permit) I made her at length to condescend to my request, which was to put her self in my place on my Wedding-night, being certain of her honesty and virtue: I believed, I might by that deceit prevent the suspition which you must perceive by me, and I for∣bear to apprehend— Mariana with great per∣swasions, and not without much difficulty, consented, not only for the loss of what she held the dearest thing in the World, but for the un∣certainty of success in this
subtle Affair. But at last she resolvd to extricate me from the Labyrinth I was in, and put off all other considera∣tions; which did succed as I hoped it would; for as soon as you came to Bed, and the Lights with-drawn, I desired you to permit me to make a prayer before an Image in my Chamber, to perform a vow I had made. I arose, and Mariana, whom I had concealed, was ready, and easily took fit time to put her self in my place. But after some time, seeing she (contrary to the orders I gave) remained with you, I suspected she was well plea∣sed
to stay in your Arms, or else she migt also fall a∣sleep; and hearing that the clock struck three, I began to conclude I was in ex∣tream peril, considering that it was impossible to awake her & you not perceive me. When taking counsel from my jealousie, I descended softly into the Hall, where I put as many combustible things as I could find, and placed them next the Tapi∣stry, and with a Candle put all in a flame, and quickly returned to your Chamber, assuring my self that the confusion which this acci∣dent would put you in,
would not permit you to make any reflection or nice remembrances, and that hearing my voice, you would immediately go to the assi∣stance of the House, which accordingly you did, and so you left me alone with Mariana, so transported with anger against her, for the too long time she staid with you, for the disorder which she was the cause of, and the loss which must necessary follow; that I was almost resolved to thrust her through the Body with your Sword. To these con∣siderations, I joyned such as might succeed, apprehen∣ding
the consequence of what had passed between you and her, at least to find my self a continual slave to the faith and inconstancy of a maid, which necessity alone had subjected to my service: In fine, I went down with her to the Well, where our servants were bu∣sie to draw Water, and whilst they went and came, I be∣lieving I had an happy op∣portunity to disentangle my self from the confusion I was in, I commanded her to draw some Water also, and observing carefully, that none perceived me, I with much ease pushed her
into the Well, where lea∣ving her some time strug∣ling with her last Agony, and supposing her to be cer∣tainly drowned, dissem∣bling my ingratitude and cruelty, I made loud Out∣cries, and shed a Torrent of Tears (so well feigned) that you as well as the rest of the Family believed that no one could be more af∣flicted than I appear to be. That horrible offence, and this abominable sin, wherewith I have so highly offended Heaven, have drawn down all the miseries and just punishments of your unhappy Auristlla, who
still loved and respected you with all imaginable fidelity and constancy, of which Truth both Heaven and Earth are Witnesses. Thus my dear Philander, I request of you (as the last Grace you can confer on me) to believe that your Reputation was never blast∣ed by any deportment of mine. I could have concea∣led what I now inform you of, but I would that by the sincerity of this Declaration you may the better judg of my Words, which is all the consolation that remains in my afflicted heart; and I recommend to you to do such things as a Zeal so
Christian-like, as yours will both prompt and oblige you to, but more particu∣larly that you would make satisfaction (as much as is possible for you to do) for those two cruel Murders, which is the only thing that does and ought to tor∣ment me in this World. Auristella died the same day, and I immediatly left Seville, hoping that Heaven would be so propitious to take me out of this Land of the Living, where now I write this Tragical History, that I may be soon rejoyn∣ed to my amiable and faith∣ful, though unhappy Au∣ristella.
The Pleasant Story of the Life of PAUL of Sigovia. I am of Sigovia, my Fa∣thers Name is Clement Paul, a Native of the City; (Heaven take his Soul) to speak the truth, he was by Trade a Barber; he marri∣ed Aldonce Saturna of Revola who had the reputation not to be the best Christian of that Country; and there might be made very plea∣sant Remarks on both their Lives, for he passed for a dextrous Thief, and she for
the most expert person of the Kingdom in the Traf∣fick of Maidenheads; the breach whereof she would so well repair, that they seemed better than whole-new; but I will not so much enlarge on the Sub∣ject of their many famous Exploits, that I may the sooner give you a particular account of my own. I was early put to School, where I contracted friend∣ship with the son of Don A∣lonso Coronello, a person of Quality, which served me not a little to parry against the subtle calumnies which the Schollars made at me;
some calling me Don of the Lance, and others Don of the Wind; in fine, I was their Butt at which they shot a thousand raileries of this na∣ture, and I had not wit e∣nough to repel them, as you may judg by a simpli∣city I am to relate to you. One day as I was walking the Street with my friend Don Diego Coronello, we met a man named Pontius Da∣guira, a man of publick em∣ploy; Don Diego bid me call him Pontius Pilate, which to divert him I did, but the man became so fiercely an∣gry, that drawing his Knife pursued me to my Masters
House, where I saved my self, but to appease him, my master lustily whipt me, ask∣ing at every lash he gave me, will you sirrah say Pon∣tius Pilate again? you may believe I promised I would not. This made so dread∣ful an impression on my spirits, that the day follow∣ing, I being called to say my Prayers, instead of say∣ing (as in the Creed) he suf∣fered under Pontius Pilate, I said he suffered under Ponti∣us Daguira: Judg you now if this simplicity made them not to laugh enough at me? It happened not long af∣ter (the Time of Carnival)
a King of the Schollars was to be made; (a pleasant custom in those Parts) and the Lot fell on me, and therefore I requested my Parents to send me a pro∣portionable Equipage for my new Dignity. The day being come for our public Parade, I appeared mounted on a Horse, who through his very weakness rather than civility, so walked as if he was making reverence; he had his Flank like a Mon∣key, and a swelling like a Camel, being blind and without a Tail; in fine, mo∣ving from one side to ano∣ther, with the gravity of a
Pharisee, and my compani∣ons walking on foot near me, we came to the Market-place amongst the Fruite∣rers, my Horse being almost famished, greedily seized on a Cabbage, and almost made but one swallow of it: The accursed Fruiterer (to whom it appertained) began with full-mouth to rail at us, and in an instant the rest being alarmed, pel∣ted us with Stones, Pears, Turnips and a thousand o∣ther parts of Trash vvere hurled at the poor King; I vvould have quitted my Horse (judging that this Combate vvould be best de∣termined
afoot) but my Horse receving a cruel blow made him reel into a Jakes, into vvhich vve both fell; my Comrades in the mean time vvith stones repulsed the Fruiterers, and vvound∣ed tvvo of them in the head; at length the Officers of Ju∣stice came and seized some of them and some of the Schollars, and disarmed them, for they had Svvords and Poniards as the Kings Guards. I novv vvas got up again out of the filth in a stinking posture, as you may imagine, and I threvv into a House my Arms, my Hat and my Mantle to have
them washed. Then an Officer of Justice loudly cried, deliver your Arms, I replied I had none offensive but only against the Nose. He would carry me to Pri∣son, but knowing not what part to take me, he was con∣strained to let me alone; I returned to Don Alonso Coro∣nello with his Son, who was preserved in the Battel: His Father soon after that took a resolution to place his son Pensioner, with a Graduate named Cabra, who in his House had the Tuition of some young Gentlemen of Quality, and got my Parents to consent that I should be his servant.
We were Listed the first Sunday after Easter, under the power of a Living Fa∣mine. The said Segnior Ca∣bra had nothing great but Stature; he had a very lit∣tle head, covered with red hair; and it is sufficient to say according to the Pro∣verb, no good Cats or Dogs that are red; his eyes were sunk into the hindermost part of his head, insomuch that he seemed to look through a Trunk; his Nose half eaten by Scurf, which came not to pass through Debauchery because that would cost money: His Mustachios were thick a∣bout
his mouth, whieh seem∣ed to have a desire to de∣vour them, so famished it did appear: He had several Teeth wanting, which doubtless he had caused to be drawn to set to adorn the Bell of an itinerant Tooth-drawer: His Throat was as long as an Austritchs; the Apple whereof seemed so large as if necessity had forced it out to see for Vi∣ctuals; his Arms drye; his Hands as shrivled Loppings of Vines, viewing him from the Wast downwards: He seemed like a Fork or Com∣pass, so long and magre did his Thighs appear when he
moved; His Bones resoun∣ded like the Ivory Clickets of a Leopard, which they use to give People notice to avoid them; His Tongue was stammering; his Voice whining; his Beard long, which was never shaved to save charges, saying he had so much repugnance that a Barbers hand should touch his Face that he had rather die than be shaved: He wore in Summer a Bonnet which was nibled by Mice, which heretofore might be Cloth, and was lined with the swea∣ty Greece which fell from his Head: many People said that his Vest was mira∣culous,
because one could not divine what colour it had; some seeing it so bear, said it was made of Frogs skins; others said it was an illusion which near hand seemed black, and at a di∣stance blew; it was never girt about him; and he had no Cuffs or Band: His long Hair that covered his Vest (as narrow and short as it was) made him look like a true Lacquey of Death; in his miserable Chamber he conjured the Rats, for fear they should eat his old Rags; His Bed was on the Ground on which he lay on the brink of it, that he might
not wear out his Bed-cloths; In fine, one may call him the Prototype of Poverty and Misery. Don Diego and I were de∣livered into the hands of this Phantosm, who appoin∣ted a Chamber: The time of Dinner being come, the Gentlemen set themselves at a Table, in a place no lar∣ger than the half of a Bush∣el, which served as a Refecto∣ry: I soon observd that there were no Cats; an old Do∣mestick (whose leanness ma∣nifested that he was a Retai∣ner to this Inne) perceiving that I seemed astonished, said to me (half weeping)
who told you that Cats are friends to Fastings and Pe∣nances? I perceive you are but a Novice here: This I protest began much to af∣flict me, and much the more when I certainly perceived, that such as had for some time been in this House had Complexions which looked as if daubed with Diachilon. The Segnior Cabra pla∣ced himself at the Table, and gave the Benediction, after which an eternal Meal was made, which had nei∣ther beginning nor end. — There was brought us in Wooden Ladles a Broth so clear, that if Narcissus had
taken it, he might have been in more danger than at the Fountain. I consi∣dered what pains the poor fingers took in swim∣ming in it, and to dive to pull up from the bottom of the Ladle one Orphelim or only Pease; at each gulph which Cabra swallowed; Ah! (said he) It's sure enough that there is nothing better than the sup, let People say what they will, all the rest is but superfluity and Gor∣mandise; and when he had ended, 'tis this said he that gives Health, and sharpens the Wit; the Devil take thee (said I to my self) and then I beheld a Boy come in
(whom I took for a half Ghost, so lean and unflesht he was) carrying a Dish in, which was a morsel of meat, which looked as if it had been cut from his Carkass, with a few Turnips about it; Cabra cries out in seeing it, Hovv! hovv! here are Tur∣nips? I svvear nothing in the World can compare vvith this Chear; eat my Lads, I am much pleased vvhen I see you eat vvell, then he gave to each of them so great a part, that their Nails and Teeth had pre∣possest it, and none left for their longing Stomacks: O admirable entertainment
for people half dead vvith hunger: Thus vvas the vvorthy Repast ended, of vvhich there remaining a little skin and a fevv Bones; here said Cabra (very grave∣ly) preserve the rest for the servants, they must eat too as vvell as their masters, vve vvill not have all for our selves. May the Devil con∣found thee with all thou hast eaten said I, thee who makest so cruel Threats to my Bowels: After Grace he said to his Pensioners, go and divert your selves in the Walk, and use some exer∣cise till two a Clock, that what you have eaten may
not make you sick; at which I could not forbear to laugh, which obliged him to give me a sharp re∣primand, to which he ad∣ded four or five old Sen∣tences; then we sate our selves at Table, and I seeing the miserable report, against which my Belly demanded Justice; but being lately bet∣ter fed, and stronger than the others, I pull'd the Dish to me, which all had seiz'd on, and of three morsels I swallowed two, which made them grumble; and Cabra entring at the noise was made; how now, said he, ate as brethren, since Hea∣ven
gives you enough, do not quarrel; is there not sufficient for all of you? I swear, to ye that there was one of us, who was a Jas∣coner, that had so utterly for∣got how and through what one eats, who holding a lit∣tle morsel of Skin, that fell to his share, put it twice to his Eyes and Hands, the third time had much adoe to conduct it to his Mouth: Then I took a pot full of Water to drink, but scarcely had I put it to my Lips, but the half Ghost Boy (I spoke of) took it from me, and made it pass from hand to hand, as delicately as one
takes the Wine after the Communion. I then arose with much grief, to find my self in such a place, where one drinks to the health of the Bowels, altho' nothing can come to them to do reason for it. Altho' I had not eaten, I took a fancy to uneat (that is to say, to do my necessities) and asked of an ancient Guest, where the convenient place was, he re∣plied, he believed there was none, and that for one on∣ly time that this might hap∣pen, whilst I staid here, I might make use of any Post I pleased; and that he him∣self had had no need these
two moneths, from the day he first entred, and then he did (as well as I perhaps) only emply what he had re∣ceived the Eve before. O how could I express my sor∣row! It was so great, that considering the little that should for the future come into my Body, I durst never let any thing out, what de∣sire soever I should have. Don Diego ask'd me what he should say to his Bowels, to perswade them that he had eaten, which most as∣suredly would not believe him. The ills that Inanition causes, were more frequent in this House than those
which too much repletion causes in another. But now 'twas Supper-time; there was served up a little of the Masters Name which is Goat Roasted. Did the Devil e∣ver invent such a Ragoust? He told us that nothing was more wholesome or profi∣table, than to eat little at supper, and cited a million of Aphorisms of hellish Phy∣sitians, which prov'd that slender diet hindred vain and false dreams — Could one make falser at his house than to dream that one had eaten? They supp'd and were sapp'd, and yet did not sup. Well we went to bed,
and neither was it possible for Don Diego or me, to sleep one wink the whole night long, but spent the time in contriving fit means to com∣plain to his Father, and I counsell'd him with much earnestness so to do, to which in time he did. But sir, are you very assured, said I, that we are living? Have we not been kill'd in the Combate that happened between the Fruiterers and us? Are we not Souls condemned to the pains of Purgatory? If it be so, 'tis a raillery to believe that your Father can clear us from hence; this cannot be done, if some charitable
persons do not recite for us extraordianary Prayers of Jubile, and cause Masses to be said for us on some pri∣viledg'd Altar. With these entertainments, and a little time that we nodded, it was morning and time for us to rise. At six a clock the Seg∣nior Cabra call'd us for to say our Lessons — Fear had made me leaner in one day than others in fifteen, My Shoulders and my Stomach did already swim in my Doublet; my Legs had need of seven pair of Stockins; my Teeth were become of an Orange colour (the true colour of despair) He made
me read the first Lesson to the others, and my hunger was so great, that I broke my Fast in eating half of the words. All this may be easily believed by him who shall know what his Man told me, that he had seen tvvo fat pad Nags put to him to keep, vvhich three daies after were become so lank, that they might as 'twere, fly through the Air: Also two fat Mastiff-dogs, that within a daies space, went out more slender than Grey-hounds. He did as∣sure me that all this was true and, I; who began to be acquainted with the Inne, did easily believe it.
Cabra at length heard that there were many murmur∣rings in the City against him, for the bad chear he made us, resolved it should be bet∣ter, and to that end he got a Box made of Tin, full of holes, in which he put a lit∣tle Bacon, and having fast∣ned a little string to it, he let it hang a little while in the Pot, but finding that it was too expensive, he be∣lieved it to be sufficient on∣ly to shew it the Bacon with∣out putting it in. Don Diego and I being not able longer to support our hunger, which had af∣flicted us for a moneth,
feign'd our selves sick, not of a Feaver, for it might be easily observed we had none; and to complain of Head∣aches, or Aches of the Teeth, that was not sufficient to get us more meat. At length we concluded to say, that we had great gri∣ings in our Guts, for having not been at stool in a long time; hoping that for sa∣ving of six pence, to pro∣vide us remedy, he would rather be prevailed with to send us to Don Diego's Fa∣thers House, but the Devil ordered it otherwise, for Cabra had inherited a Re∣ceipt from his Father, who
was an Apothecary, and so sent for an old Hag of se∣venty years old (who was his Aunt) who served him as a Nurse-keeper, whom he ordered to prepare each of us a Clyster; they began with Don Diego, who could not resist them, and the old Nurse, instead of putting it into his Body, pusht it be∣tween his Skin and the Chine of his Back, and spouted it up to the Nape of his Neck, in as much as that which should have served him for inward Furniture, served to garnish him without, which made the poor Lad to cry for help, but Cabra coming
in bid her give the other Clyster to me, and then they would prepare another for Don Diego. I had put on my Clothes (purposely to avoid it) but that would not serve my turn, for Ca∣bra himself with a Crew, he had got hold on me in such manner as I could not stir; and the Nurce gave it me with as much dispatch as she could, but I presented a good part to her Nose be∣fore she had leisure to get out of the way: The Ma∣ster thereupon fell into a rage against me, and threat∣ned to put me out of doors, but it was not my good
fortune to be so used. We made our complaints to Don Diego's Father, but Cabra sent him word it was only because we would not study, so that all we could do or say proved unsuc∣cessful. He made his old Aunt the Governess of the Fami∣ly, and to dress our provi∣sion for us, and to serve his Pensioners; and turned a∣way his man, because on a Friday he perceived some few Crumbs of Bred to be on his Clothes; Heaven knows what we suffered un∣der this damned Hag. She was exceeding deaf, and
blind, moreover she was so great a mutterer of Pater Nosters, that one day the string of her Beds being broke they fell into the Pot, which made her serve us with the devoutest sop that ever I eat in my life, some said look here what black Pease we have, without doubt they are Ethiopian Pease: Our master was the first who tasted, and having got one of them into his mouth, and biting it broke one of his Teeth; she would ordinarily put the Fire-pan into the Pot instead of the Ladle: I commonly found hairs, little sticks and rolls
of flocks that she usd to spin, which I fancied she put in on purpose to cram our Bellies the more. All these miseries we en∣dured until the Lent fol∣lowing, the beginning whereof one of the Pensi∣oners fell fick; Cabra to a∣void expence, delayed sen∣ding for a Physitian, till the poor Patient had need of, and requested, a Confessor, at length he had procured a Mountebank to come, who feeling his Pulse, said that Famine had by little and little killed the young man; they brought him the Holy Sacrament, and
when he saw it (he who had not spoke in a whole daies time) said, my Lord and Saviour, it was neces∣sary that I saw you enter into this House for to con∣vince me that it was not Hell; and after the recei∣ving it he died, and was poorly buried because he was a stranger, which grie∣ved us exceedingly. The Rumour of this pitiful Death spread through the City, and came to the Ears of Don Alonso, who having no other Child but Don Di∣ego, he became disabused of the Cruelties of Cabra, and gave credit to two sha∣dows;
(for we were redu∣ced to that Estate) and quickly came to take us from this detestable Inne, where although he saw us before his eyes yet asked of us (our selves) where we were; but when he came to the perfect knowledg of us, he treated the Graduate Cabra in very foul terms; then he got us carried from thence in a Chair, and our miserable companions fol∣lowed us with their eyes, with the same sentiments as the Slaves at Algire do, when they see the depar∣ture of such as are Redeem∣ed: Being arrived at Don
Alonso's House, they put us very gingerly into Bed least our Bones should get out of their places and fall on the Ground: Spies were sent for to pry into what part of our Faces our Eyes were hid: And as my suf∣ferings had been greatest, and my hunger imperial; (for I was alwaies treated as a servant) it was a long time e're they could find my Eyes. Physitians were speedily sent for, who strait ordred that the dust on our mouths should be brushed off with a Foxes Tail, as is usually done from Pictures; then they directed to give
us some substance, especial∣ly good Jellies. It is im∣possible to tell the illumi∣nations of Joy that our Bowels received on the first Nourishment which we took. They forbad chief∣ly, that during nine daies any one should speak aloud in our Chamber, because our stomacks being hollow every word made an Ec∣cho; With these and some other precautions, we be∣gan to amend, and to reco∣ver a little motion; but they had much adoe to make us open our Jaws, which they effected by lit∣tle and little with certain
Engines which they inven∣ted. At the end of four daies we arose, but looked like the shadows of other men; and so yellow and magre vve vvere, that once we were taken to be the Offspring of the Fathers of the Desert. We spent most of our time in paying our thanks to Heaven for re∣deeming us from the Cap∣tivity of the cruel Cabra, praying that never any Christian might fall into his Tyrannick hands. We related sometimes to Don Alonso all his Maxims a∣gainst Gormandizing; (al∣though the miserable Cabra
was never guilty of that sin) and we made him laugh heartily, when we told him, that when he taught us the Holy Com∣mandment (one of which sayes) Thou shalt not kill— he still added mark, ye said he, Kill? Kill what? not only Men, but Patridges, Pheasants, and Capons, or any thing else indeed that he would not give us to eat. After we had been three moneths at Don Alon∣so's, he took a resolution to send his Son to compleat his Studies at Alcala, and asked me if I would attend him; I was never more
pleased than to be sent far enough from the sound of the very name of this per∣secutor of Stomachs, and I humbly accepted the Ser∣vice, and to live with him as long as he should com∣mand me. Alonso allotted his Son a Steward, whose name was Aranda, to go∣vern his Affairs, with a Bill of Exchange on a Merchant called Julian Merluche, and accordingly we took Coach. At Alcala, Don Diego re∣ceived a Letter from his Father, in which there was one also for me, which came from one of my Uncles named Archos Rampion, a
very vertuous Man, and well known in Segovia, by the justicial Office he exer∣cised; for all which had been done these four years, passed through his hands; not to tell you a lie — he was Hangman there, but an Eagle in his Profession; and few men that ever saw him practice, but were am∣bitious to be hanged by him. I will read you what he writes — My dear Nephew Paul, The continual Occupations in which the King emploies me, in my Function of my charge, have hindred me from Writting to you
sooner; you know that his Majesties Service ought to be preferr'd above all things. I am (though with much regret) obliged to acquaint you with some ill news — Your Father died eight daies since, with more courage and resolu∣tion, than ever any shewed against the Attacques of Death. I can speak it to my certain knowledge, as one who rais'd him up, and was his Supervisor. He mounted on an Ass, with∣out putting Foot in Stir∣rup; the Robe which serves on these occasions, seem∣ed to have been made for
him: He went with much gravity; he looked on the Windows (as he pass'd) sa∣luting all who quitted their Occupations to see his Pro∣cession; he twice turned up his Mustachios, bid his Con∣fessors take Breath, and observ'd the most remark∣able points of their Dis∣course to him, which they were glad to hear, and prais'd him highly for it. He arrived to the Gallows, and ascended the Ladder with as much dexterity as the best Cat in Christen∣dom could do; and per∣ceiving one Round of the Ladder to be broken, he
descended again, and with a graceful presence of Wit, applied himself to the Of∣ficers of Justice, minding them to get it mended for some others, because every one had not as much agi∣lity as he. I cannot express the admiration which his Bon-graces attracted from the whole World. Being sat on the top of the Lad∣der, he turned back the folds of his Robe, then he took the Halter and put it about his own Neck, and seeing that the Thealin [one of a religious Order] would again preach to him; said he, good Father, I account
I have had preaching e∣nough, let us dispatch I pray, for I desire not to ap∣pear Prolix in my Affairs; He recommended to me the placing of his Bonnet on his Ear, and to wipe well his Face when he was dead, which I faill'd not to do: He fell without open∣ing his Legs, or making the least grimace, and all with a gravity without ex∣ample. I quartered him and gave him the High∣wayes for his Sepulcher. Heaven knows the dolor which I resent, to see him there to keep open Table for the Jayes and Crowes;
but I hope that the Pastry Cooks of this Country, will give us some Con∣solation, and put him in∣to Paste in their pettit Pat∣tees. I might almost tell you the same of your Mo∣ther (although she survives him) for she is in the In∣quisition at Toledo, she is charged with disinterring the Dead, and going e∣very night to have a Bene∣diction at the Sabbal; [which is the Conventicle of Wit∣ches] there has been found with her more Heads, Legs and Arms, than in a Chap∣pel of Miracles.
I am much afflicted that she is such a dishonour to all of us, and more par∣ticularly to my self, that am a Minister of his Ma∣jesties, for such Kindred are a great prejudice to the dignity of my Employ. There rests here some Money concealed from your Father, which may amount to about 400 Duckets; I am your Un∣cle, and all I have shall be for you: I advise you on receipt hereof, that you make a turn hither, with what Latin and Rhetorick you have learnt, for you will become a singular
man in the art of Hang∣manship. dress to me your sud∣dain answer; in the mean time Heaaven preserve you, So I remain, Your good Uncle Archos Rampion.
I cannot deny but this News did very much af∣flict me, but that which brings me some comfort (at least to mitigate some part of my sorrow) is the hopes and honour of my Uncles Letter, which I con∣fess is full of brave and lear∣ned Expressions, which made me withdraw from the presence of Don Diego to write him an answer; and I thought it would be∣come my prudence not to acquaint him with the pur∣port of it; for who does know whether in this pry∣ing Age, he or some other
great person by their inte∣rest at Court, of the pow∣erfulness of Purse, might not prevail with his Maje∣sty, or the Magistrates of Segovia, to get the Reversi∣on of that high Office from me, which my honourable Uncle seems to design for me; so writing my thoughts, I found it much trouble to shew some Eloquence being not used to it, nor knew I well how to address it—then I began to write my Let∣ter. Dear Ʋncle—phsa— (said I) that is not well begun, and looks too Citizen-like— Honoured—Ʋncle—And
this begins as it were wrote to an ordinary Gentleman, Most Honourable Ʋncle; ay that sounds very well, and is fit for a person of so high Quality and Education; so having blotted out the two first, I fairly wrote it over, and resolved to address it. For the Honourable Archos Rampion, His Majesties High Officer of Justice at Segovia.
Most Honourable Ʋncle, YOUR generous Lines were so emphatical∣ly welcome, that I kiss'd them a million of times, that done, I assumed Pen Ink and Paper, to present to you my acknowledge∣ments for your most obli∣ging Letter, in which you manifest an heroick zeal for the welfare of your Kin∣dred, and particularly of my unworthy self; I did not untill now consider the advantage and preferment that Latin and Rhetorick may bring me to, for I perceive by yours that it
is very necessary in your high Employ. Another man would have writ me that my Father was hang'd, and Mother a Thief, Baud and Witch, and that's all; but you Sir I find, according as is expected from per∣sons of your great quality, do not plainly tell mat∣ter of Fact, as Common Rogues do, but express it in a gallant and honou∣rable phraise, according to to the rules of Gran∣deur. I protest Sir, your Letter has almost, distra∣cted me with joy, that I may become honourable too, after the time that I
have been afflicted in the cruellest manner that ever a living Creature was, for I must tell you that I have been almost starved at a Villains House, called Ca∣Cabra, and all I got by my long suffering, was that which you so much com∣mend — Latin and Rhe∣torick; and here I shall learn more — and so by that and your Favour I may get the honourable Dignity you mention, and have wherewith now and then to eat an Oli-podrido, and White Bread and good Oyl, instead of mel∣ted Tallow, the droppings
of Candle (for we had no Kitchin-stuff) which my niggardly Master treasured up to be eaten only on high Festivals for Sauce, and to lie on a soft Quilt instead of a sack of hard knotted Flocks and Straw; but now Sir I eat pretty well, and will eat much more, to make me of a height requisite, which this Employment may require; and I begin to turn up some Hayes already to∣wards the obtaining of Mustachios, which I fancy are very becoming, and will shew Greatness and State on the top of the
Ladder. In short Sir, I shall study my Eyes out but I will make my self fit to take your place, which I hope and request you will secure for me; So I humbly kiss the hands of your Seignory, and sub∣scribe my self, Most Honourable Ʋncle, Your overjoy'd and most honourable Servant, Paul of Segovia.
Honourable Sir, PErmit this Postcript to request you, that if you know of any o∣ther Name my Father had, than Paul of Sego∣via, to give me notice of it, that I cease to use this, for methinks I should have a great Name for my Office, yours sounds bravely, but I wonder you do not write your self Don Archos Rampion: I request your Sentiments herein and Directions of your Command in this material Notion, for as yet I am not versed in the
Politicks; nor have I read any thing relating to State-Affairs or Offices of His Majesties Service; once more I humbly kiss the hands of your Seignory: Which Letter I sent by the Post; and when I have received an answer I will tell you more of my Adventures.
On the Qualities of a Marriage; or cer∣tain Rules for the Choice of a Wife, in a Letter to the Countess of— THAT which I ought to desire in a Wife for my repose, my ho∣nour and my safety, is to have had her Educated in your Graces Service, in your own House, since she can bring me no bet∣ter Portion, either Tem∣poral
or Spiritual, than to have been well instructed in obedience, and to be able with just Title to say that she had the Quality of your most humble Ser∣vant. But if your Grace shall command me to say more, I wil frankly tell you all the parts that I wish I could find in a Wife, that I might expect from the favour of Hea∣ven or your Bounty; and this I will declare rather out of a design to entertain than to in∣struct you.
Madam I am no other thing but what your Gra∣ces Husband has made me, for without him I was without credit in the World and undone man; and if at this day I am any thing more, it is be∣cause he was pleased to make me cease to be what I was—I have been wick∣ed more waies than one, and ceasing to be so, yet I cannot lawfully say that I am good, because I forsook not evil but when I was weary to com∣mit, and not with a real desire to repent of it; I
had not in this any end, but to put my self in safety; and I cannot be deceived, having no sort of malice which has not served me as an example or aversion. I am in some considera∣tion among my Neigh∣bours, Master in my own House and Son of Ancestors, whose Memory honours one, but I mortifie them by mine. As for my riches and my years, I shall alwaies govern them in such man∣ner
as I will endeavour to make it evident, that I have less years than Goods. My Person gives nei∣ther disgust nor aversion; and if it acquires not great praises, at least it attracts no maledictions or railleries from such who see me. Those who love me not, say that I am lame, for true it is that I seem so to them by a negli∣gence in walking, inso∣much that they deter∣mine
not whether I am effectually lame, or whe∣ther I make continual re∣verences. Now that I have a∣vowed who and what I am, I will declare how I wish a Wife to be that the Lord should please to give me; I confess it would be too great an impu∣dence in me (without the command of your Gra∣ces) to say how I would have a Wife, since that few Women would have me such as I am.
I desire, precisely, that she be noble, and she have Wit; for if she be innocent, she would be uncapable of Conversati∣on, and to possess two things which I account most essential to a noble Soul, which are Equality and Virtue. I expect in her what is necessary in a married Woman, which may not be in a Blest and Religious One; and that her Oratory be her Duty to her Husband. But I would rather love her Innocent than Scient
as a Preacher, it being more easie to endure that which a person knows not, than to suffer by that which he presumes. I would have one nei∣ther Fair nor Ʋgly, be∣tween those Extreams, the middle is more agree∣able and safe; Ʋgly, she is no company, but a perpetual disgust; Fair, she is not so much a de∣light as a continual care; but if it must be that she be one or the other, I would have her to be rather Fair than Ʋgly;
for it is better to have Care than Fear; and to have one guard than to flye from. I would not desire one rich or poor, that she had only so much as was necessary; that she might not be said to buy me or I her; where Virtue is to be found Wealth ought not to be in great con∣sideration. If he who possesses her, quits her because he be∣lieves her to be poor, he cannot be rich but with
Infamy—And if he who possesses her not, desires her because he believes her to be rich, he is poor with Infamy. I should love her bet∣ter Gay than Sad; for in Domestick Affairs the oc∣casions of sadness will not fail us, which honestly moderate carefulness and joy will. To have a Wife that is dull and alwaies reti∣red like a Cobweb in a Corner, it is to espouse a continual disgust of life.
It is necessary that she be Proper, for my only sa∣tisfaction, and not to please those who have but leisure to partake her; she should be drest with what becomes her best, and not with that which the Libertism of other Wo∣men invents; she must not do that which some do, but that which all ought to do. I should love her ra∣ther to be a Huswife than a Prodigal, for from the one nothing but fears is to be expected, and from
the other profit is to be hoped — But it would be a great good to fin done that is liberal — It would be indifferent to me whether she was Brown or Fair, I desire only that if she be Brown, that she labour not to become Fair — for falsities and disquiets gives commonly more suspition than Love. It imports not much whether she be Short or Tall; Chiopins or Stilts (much used in Spain and Italy)
make almost all sizes, and each Stature has its pecu∣liar Charms and Graces— As for what regards Fatness or Leanness, if I cannot find one of a ne∣cessary plumpness, she would rather please me, being lean, and would be more acceptable to my Fancy, to be rather slender as a Cow than gross as a Tun. I would have one neither in Infancy nor much Aged; the one would be as a Cra∣dle, the other as a Coffin. I have forgot how Chil∣dren
are Rock'd; and I have not yet learned the Responses, which are said for the Dead — I must have one made, which I nevertheless wish was a young one — I wish above all, that she had not those delicate Hands, those fair Eyes, and that pretty Mouth; for with those three things, which of themselves are perfectly good, it would be impossible that one could suffer it, because that Women make them∣selves unsupportable with their costly Bracelets, to have their Hands gazed
on, which are alwaies as 'twere fencing with their curled Hairs, and still wea∣ving them into Cobwebs, and emploping them a∣bout their Head-tire, to give occasion to consider their fair Eyes, which they rock, and put them to sleep, then awake 'em on a sudden, and make 'em seem dying; with so ma∣ny Apish postures, that the Devil himself cannot not suffer. Is it not ridicu∣lous to see a Woman at every moment to shew her Teeth, to haev'em admired, rolling and biting her
Cherry Lips, to give fresher colour to 'em, as if she af∣fected to study the Gri∣maces of an angry gur∣ling Mastiff, or of one that was damn'd. Too much care is disadvanta∣geous to perfection, when negligence most often hides defects. I covet not that she be an Orphan, because I would not be obliged to so many comemorations of the Dead; neither would I have her to have much Kindred, 'tis sufficient if she has a Father and a
Mother in this World, and all her Aunts in Pur∣gatory, for whom I will cause as many Masses to be said as she in reason should request. I should esteem it a fa∣vour of Heaven, if she was a little deaf, or did a lit∣tle stammer; those Qua∣lities will avoid long Con∣versations and frequent Vi∣sits, which will make the best conditioned Woman, to lose half of the Ware in words, which are pro∣fitable for nothing.
And that which would be the most important, is that she suffer no Go∣verness (Duegna) in her House, which is in my opinion an instrument lit∣tle necessary in Huswife∣ry: However it is cer∣tain, that I will esteem her such as I shall have her; and that (if it must be so) I will suffer as I merit, presuming that I may be married with lit∣tle good fortune: But that it is very difficult that I be ill-married. FINIS.
