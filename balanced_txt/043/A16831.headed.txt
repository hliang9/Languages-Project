TO THE RIGHT HONble, ROBERT GREVILL, Lord BROOKE of BEAVCHAMP-COVRT, Grace, and Peace. RIGHT HONORABLE, YOur Goodnesse as the timely Spring, sprou∣ting foorth into the buds, and blossomes of pious resolutions, and so Honourably atended, is as a Citie set on a hill, which cannot bee hid. But promiseth a farre off, vnto all honest passengers to bee a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the Tempest: Isa. 32.2.
Wherefore this insuing Treatise ha∣uing now receiued its birth, & being; and as a Pilgrim, being to passe abroad into the world, to seeke entertainment; doth conceiue hope of safety vnder your sha∣dow, and of good acceptation in the Church, and among others of the hou∣shold Faith, and heires of Promise, through your fauourable acceptance. And therefore I haue made bold hum∣ly to present it vnto your Honourable protection, and noble admission, to doe your selfe its first service; that from this hill of SION, unto the valleyes of the same; the streams therof running downe, as a riuer of still waters, may refresh, and make glad the City of GOD. Which preasent, as it is mine, can pro∣mise no more vnto your Lordship, than could the Carkeis, of a dead Lyon vnto SAMPSON or than IEREMIAH his girdle, which was profitable for nothing: (Iere. 13.7.) And therefore, as a thing vndesi∣red, to be buried out of your sight. Yet if you shall vouchsafe to waye the con∣tents,
and the matter whereof it consi∣steth, you may be mooued to thinke the same meete to attend your most retyred presnce. But not to detaine your Lordship in the gate; because of wisedomes voyce: (Prou. 8.1.) Whch is as the noise of many waters: (Reu 1.15.) Crying from within and saying. Eate O friends; drinke; yea drinke abundantly, O beloued. (Cant. 5.10.) Yea come, buy Wine, and milke, with∣out money, and without price: (Isa. 55.1) Therefore humbly taking my leaue, and leving your Lordship a this feast of fat things, which the Lord of hosts hath made vnto all people (Ia. 25.6.) there well to fare. And with my vnfained, and fer∣vent desire, and prayer vnto God, for a daily grouth, and increase of all grace in your Lordship so happily begunne, I doe rest, and shall for euer remaine. Your Lordships, most humbly devoted▪ F. B.
TO THE READER. THough the Lord in Hea∣ven, of his infinite good∣nes, and mercy hath left vnto vs his poore people on eath, his holy & bles∣sed word, to be a light to our feet, and a Lanthorne to our paths, which is able to make vs wise to Salvati∣on, and absolute to every good worke, to guide vs well and safely through this dangerous world, and to bring vs home to himselfe at the last in peace: And hath given vs charge to search the Scrip∣tures, as they that testifie of Christ Iesus, and in whch wee looke to haue Eternall life, and that it should dwell plenteously in vs in all wisdome, and hath given vnto vs in this Land peaceable, and happy times af∣fording vs leaue, and opportunity to exercise
our selues in the same, yet such is the ex∣treame folly, and sinfulnesse of the heart of man, that the most part of people cumber themselues about many things; profits, plea∣sures lusts, or any thing, and neglect that one thing that is necessary, few chusing the good part, that neuer shall bee taken from them that haue it, but spend their time, and strength of affection vpon fading vanities, that will leaue them without com∣fort in their greatest need; having a price in their hand to get wisedome (which is farre beter than all pearles) but haue no hart, nor doe vnderstand the things that belong to their peace, in this day of their vi∣sitation. Wherefore as the Lord may take vp the lke complaint against vs, as hee did against his Israel long agoe: (Hos. 8.12.) That hee had written vnto them the great things of his Law, but they had counted them a strange thing: so may he also haue a Controversy against vs, as a∣gainst them: (Hos. 4.1.2.) For that there is no mercy, nor truth, nor knowledge of God in the Land, for the generality be∣ing
too true with vs. And therefore he may iustly take away the Gospell of the Kingdome frō vs, & giue it to thē that will more high∣ly esteeme it, make better vse, & bring forth more fruit of the same: (Math. 27.43) And send vs a Famine ot of bread, and thirst of water, but of that bread of life, the good word of God, that Spirituall Manna, so much loathed or at least so little regarded: (Amos, 8.11.12.) Yet as our gracious and good God forbeareth this sinfull, and vn∣thankfull Nation, with admirable and vn∣speakable patience beyond expectation, so ceaseth he not by many meanes to bring vs to a greater care and Conscience of our du∣ty in this behalfe of exercising our selues (I meane) in his most blessed and good word; partly sending vs of later yeares, many Af∣flictians, and Crosses, and dayly threatning more, that finding trouble and sorrow in the world, we might be glad to seeke Comfort in God, and in his blessed word. He calles on vs also heereto by the daily Ministery of his Servants the Prophets, together with their holy bookes and writings. And that
no meanes might be left vntried to doe vs good, or leaue vs without excuse, loe here to you which are the people of God, how hee hath raised vp one from among your selues, of the common order of men (a priuate Christian I meane) for your Conviction, for your Instruction. To convince you how much wisedome and vnderstanding may be obtayned euen of priuate pesons, by a con∣stant, and painefull Reading of the Scrip∣tures, ioyned with a diligent attendance on the publike ministery of the word: as may well appeare by this worthy worke that this Author presenteth vnto you: where∣by the humble, and wellminded Readers may be whetted on to the like diligence in the Scriptures, which heere they shall see, and that not without hope of attaining that which may be worthy of Iheir paines, that so they may become wise and vn∣dtrstanding Christians. For want of which, it proves a great fault euen a∣mong the better sort of people, that they hold the points of their Religi∣on from the mouth of their Mini∣sters,
and not from the voice of God in the Scriptures, and so build, as if but a Foxe runne vpon it hee shall breake downe their stony wall. If one of like parts, and place shall teach the contrary they will bee shaken and ready to bee removed especially if hee bee backt with Authority: whereas if every Truth he holds in Religion, hee had it well grounded on a plaine testimony of Scrip∣ture, two or three, he should not bee moued with every wind of contrary Doctrine, but stand firme, and vnmoueable as Mount Zi∣on, and having withall the loue of the Truth in his heart, all the men, and meanes in the world could, nor should not remoue him from his stedfastnesse, which is the honour of a Christian endeed. And this wisedome, skill and ablty, every man may see by this his worke, to bee in the Author of this Booke, who hath brought foorth so innumerable places of Scripture for his severall purposes, with that soundnesse of Iudgement, singular dex∣terity, and great vnderstanding, as is not to be expected from a private Christian. But
hee having beene a dayly hearer of the word, and that from Zealous and fruitfull Tea∣chers, having made vse also of the same with great dlgence, and constancy in his Famly; and besides these, spent very much time in private reading and study, hee hath obtained a great degree in the Faith, and is higher by head and shoulders, (as it is said of SAVL) than the rest of his owne ranke. For I count that Interpretation and gi∣ving the sense of Scriptures as it is a dffi∣cult, so a peculiar worke to the Ministers of God (ordinarily) and not to be adventured vpon by Chrstans in their Families, or private meetings, any further than they haue good bottome from that which they haue learned by the Ministery of the Word, nor to write such Bookes as this, wherein is occasion of the vse of so much Scripture, least there should be found many mistakings therein, which were both sinfull and dangerous, and yet most likely. But God hath very mercifully guided this Author, in this his worke, which may, and I hope will be of much fruitfull and good vse in
the Church of God: For as it may helpe a∣ny ordinary Christian, yea or Minister with more paralell places, than may bee hee would haue at hand of himselfe, so it will helpe well to the vnderstanding of many places of Scriptures, seeing heere, in what sense, and to what purposes they are brought and applyed. The paines hath beene very great no doubt to one man, but if the Bene∣fit may be much, and good to many, and so God be glorified, the Author no doubt, will thinke his labour happily bestowed, and a∣boundantly rewarded, which is my great de∣sire, and humble and earnest prayer also, who is the true, though weake, and vn∣worthy Servant of the Church of God, IOHN ROGERS.
CHRISTIAN READER. IN the perusall of this Treatise thou shalt find that the Author threof hath taken very great paines, and that which is more, great paines to good purpose. Great paines are but a small Commendation where they proue not beneficiall to a common good. There are not wanting in the world that take paines more than e∣nough in the Composing, and writing of some Bookes, of whch when they haue done, it may bee truely said as of IEREMIES Girdle; That they are Good for nothing. (Ier. 13 7.) The curious trifles of many ill imployed wits want happily for no paines, but
consider whether such persons may not in another sense take vp SALOMONS words: (Eccles 2, 11) I looked on all the workes that mine hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to doe; and behold, all was vanity, and there was no profit. TheNon cernis quòd propte∣rea animalium gloriosissima est aps, non quia laborat, ed quia alijs laorat. Eti∣am aranca la∣borat & fati∣gatur, & tenu∣es per panetes extendit tex∣tur as omnem mulieris sapi∣entiam exce∣dentes, sed est ignobile ani∣mal, quia opus ejus est nulla ènus v.  ales  libi laborantes & se defatigantes. Chrysost. ad Pop. Antioch. Hom. 12. Spider is industrious in her kind, and takes paines in making of her Web, as well as the Bee in ma∣king of her Hony, and Combes. And yet who respects the Spiders web, as the Bees worke? The profit that comes of the labour of the Bee, is it that makes her labour to be in more esteeme than the Spiders. Now in this Treatise thou shalt find the Author to haue beene a diligent Industrious Bee, that hath brought a great deale of profita∣ble sweet Hony to this his hiue; it being a Treasurie and Collection out of the Word of GODS Promises which are
sweeter than the Hony, and the hony Combe. Thou shalt in this Authors Indu∣stry see how much is to be gotten by the diligent and observant reading of the Scriptures. I wish with all mine heart that his Industry may proue exempla∣ry; and that many may hereby be pro∣voked to the like religious diligence in acquainting themselues with the word. It was good counsell that a godly old man gaueIn vita Musculi apud Melch. Ad. p. 370. MVSCVLVS when he first began to Preach. That Si bonus velit fieri Concionator det operam vt sit bonus Biblicus, That if ever he would proue a good Preacher, hee must take paines to be well acquainted with the Bible. And it were to be wished that all Preachers would follow that counsell. Preaching would proue the more solid, savourie, and successefull. But I will goe further than that old man; and I say, Si bonus velis fieri Christianus, des operam v sis bo∣nus Biblicus. If thou wilt proue a
good Christian, thou must be well skil∣led in the Holy Bible. How happy were it if the Scriptures were more carefully read then they are! It is said ofNunquam Cyprianus abs∣que Tertulliani lectione vnum diem praeterijt & crebro dice∣re solirus. Da Magistrum Tertullianum significans. CY∣PRIAN, that he let no day passe without reading TERTVLLIAN, & was wont often to say, Giue me my Master, meaning TERTVLLIAN. Such diligence in reading the Scriptures would do well; Especial∣ly, they being GODS owne Epistle, and letter from Heaven vnto vs that we should know his mind. And if Princes letters are to be read thrice over, then how much more sayesDe Princi¦pum Episto∣lis prouerbio dicitur, ter eas legendas, sed profecto Dei Epistolae, sic enim Scriptu∣ram appellar Gregorius, sep∣ties ter, imo septuagies sep∣ties, seu vt plus dicam, ifini∣ties legendae sunt, &c. Lu∣ther in Gen. 16. LVTHER, should the Scriptures bee read seaven times thrice; yea, seaventy times 7. times thrice, yea infinite times over. We are commanded, (Prov. 2, 4.) To seeke for Knowledge as for Silver, and to search for her as for hid treasures. If it be asked where we must seeke, the Prophet tels vs, (Isa. 35, 16.) Seeke in the booke of the Lord, and reade. If it be asked where we must search, our Saviour tels vs: (Ioh. 5.34.)
Search the Scriptures. Those are in∣deed the Mines where the veines of this silver, and these hid treasures are to be found. And yet to see how silly men are in wearying themselues by digging in those earths which yeeld little precious treasure, and in the meane while neglect searching these golden Mines. It is our shame and sinne that we bestow more time, and paines in reading any Booke more than Gods. What excellent, and worthy monu∣ments didEgo odi me∣os libros, & saepe opto eos interire, quòd metuo ne mo∣rentur lecto∣res, & abdu∣cant à scriptu∣rae ipsius lecti∣one quae sola omnis sapien∣tiae fons est. Luth. in Genes. 19. LVTHER leaue to the world in his Writings, and how well spent is time spent in reading his workes. And yet out of a Zeale to the reading of the Scriptures, hee stickes not to wish that his owne bookes might perish, because he feared the reading of them would hinder men from reading the Scriptures. What would he wish now to a number of vain idle, corrupt, and corrupting writings, if he saw how miserably the Scriptures were neglected for the reading of these?
Now for this present Treatise, I conceiue it such a Worke as needs not the Ivie bush of an Epistle commenda∣torie: Plaut. in Poen.Invadibili merce oportet emp∣torem vltro adducere Proba merx facile emptorem rep∣perit, tametsi in abstruso sita est. I say no more of this Authors paines then SALOMON speakes of the ver∣tuous Woman, Giue him of the fruit of his hands, and let his owne worke praise him in the gates. And whe∣ther his worke will doe it, or no, let all preiudice be layd aside, and doe but as PHILIP bids NATHANAEL, (Ioh. 1, 46.) Come and see, And thou shalt soone see, that what I say of this Trea∣tise, is much short of what it doth de∣serue. Thus wishing that thy profit in the reading may bee answerable to his paines in the writing of this worke, I leaue thee to the grace of GOD, and rest, Thine, in CHRIST IESVS, Ier: Dyke.
THE AVTHORS EPISTLE TO THE READER. CHRISTIAN READER, THe Wise man saith, that of ma∣king many Bookes, there is no end, and much study is a weari∣nes of the flesh: (Eccl. 12.12.) And therefore in so great va∣riety of Bookes now extant, it will bee thy wisedome for thy exercise to make choyse of some few of the best. By which meanes, thy toile in reading will be the lesse, and thy gaine the more. The Booke of all Bookes is the Bible; which by way of Excellency is called the Scripture. Of which I may say, as DA∣VID of the Sword of GOLIATH, there is none like that: (1, Sam, 21.9.) Not∣withstanding the Word of the LORD
is to many a reproch, and they haue no delight in it: (Ier. 6, 10.) And beeing full, doe despise the Hony combe: (Prou. 27.7.) Such are but naturall, not having the Spirit: (Iud. 19.) And therefore vnable to discerne their owne need, or where to bee supplyed: (Reu. 3.17.) Others there are, of whom I am per∣swaded better things: who having tasted of the good Word of God: (Heb. 6, 9.) And by it also how gracious the Lord is, doe as new borne Babes, desire the sincere milke of the word, that they may grow thereby: (1. Pet 2.3.) But yet they finding many things hard to bee vnder∣stood: (2. Pet. 3.16.) And themselues to bee but as a Child weaned from the milke, and drawne from the Breasts: (Isa. 28 9.) Not having the vnderstanding of a man in them: (Prou. 30.2) Are by this meanes much discouraged from the reading of it; which yet in the very entrance thereinto, doth giue light, and vnderstanding to the simple: (Psal. 119.130.) Such must know, that as when the Iron is blunt, and the Wood knot∣ty, men put to the greater strength; so na∣turall defects, in the effecting of difficult things, and of such consequence, as is the reading of the Scripture, must not make them to desist; but rather set them on, to be more serious, humble, orderly, and con∣stant
in the reading of the same. And for their further direction therein, this must be remembred, that the Booke of Scripture, is as the Waters of the Sanctuary, (Ezek. 47.) In which a Lambe might wade, and an Ele∣phant Swim. Therein is contained strong staete, as well as Milke: (Heb. 5.12) Such as doe discerne themselues to bee but Babes, there is Milke provided for them: And let them leaue the strong meat vnto such, who by reason of vse, haue their sences exercised in discerning good & evill, vntill themselues al∣so come to a more full age in Christ: Heb. 5.14, Now if uch also, shall complaine, of the shortnesse of memory; by meanes where∣of, together with the prolixity of the Booke of GOD, and the various matter promiscuously couched therein; so as what they haue read, is as water spilt on the ground: (2, Sam. 14.14.) Such with the rea∣ding of Scripture, in the manner aforesaid, must ioyne after meditation: as DAVID, who hid the word in his heart: (Psal. 119.11.) And MARY who pondered, and thereby kept those things, which were told her by the Shepheards: (Luk. 2.19.) Moreouer, if they will not bee forgetfull hearers of the Word, they must bee doers of the same: (Isa. 1.25.) And withall, let
them pray the Comforter, which is the HO∣LY GHOST, who shall then both teach; and bring all things to theyr remembrance, whatsoever hee hath said vn∣to them. Notwithstanding all which labour, because many things, as eares of Corne out of the Sheafe may sl p weake memo∣ries; I haue therefore gleaned after; and from the whole Boke of GOD, as out of a large and fertile Feild, gathered vp such Simples, a are most Cordiall to the weakest Christian, and of spciall vse vnto all. Among which, because the Promises, are both the breeders, and nourishers of Sauing-Faith, the Fountaine of Spirituall Life; and therefore of price vn∣to drooping Spirits, who are weary, and heavy laeden: (Math. 11.28.) I haue for their sakes more principally layd hold vpon them; that with ioy they might draw Wat t of the Wells of Salvation: (sa. 12.3.) And because there are others also, with whom the Consolations of GOD, are small, or of none effect; (Iob. 15.11.) I h vnto each promise, an∣nexed its conti Iudgement. And in fine, haue summed vp all the particular Iudgements vnder the Generall, and
therewith also, answered such Obiections, as are by Carnall Men vsually made. And out of all, I haue also inferred such vses of Reproofe, Instruction, and Ex∣hortation, as the said Scripture hath brought to my hand, meetly to bee ap∣plyed. That if such will but reade what is written, and lay hold on Instruction, they may no longer forsake their owne Mercies, but be moued to come vnto CHRIST and liue. All which I haue as well as I could, reduced to such Heads, and in such or∣der Composed them; as by the helpe of my Table, and Catalogue of Chapters, immediatly ensuing; euery Reader may readily find out such places, as hee stands in need of, and shall desire to bee furnished with. But with this Cauti∣on to the intelligent Reader; that for such Scriptures, as may diuersly bee re∣ferred; if in searching hee doe misse of them in one place, hee may find them in an∣other. And for the better preventing or re∣mouing of Scruples from the ignorant, or tender Conscience; and of Cauils from the wilfully obstinate; I haue Dialogue-wise con∣triued the same into Question and An∣swer.
And such things, as in which the Scrip∣ture is more plenteous, I haue answere one Question, with many Scriptures Which the ignorant Reader aduisedly com¦paring together: that is to say, the darke and obscure places, with those which a more plaine, and easie, and the Questio with the answer, he shall find his Iudgemen also, in the vnderstanding of such places something bettered thereby. And if in  doing, hee shall find himselfe yet to seek, an therfore do say as the Eunuch vnto PHILIP How shall I vnderstand these things withou a guide? (Act 8.31.) Because the Priests lip are to preserue knowledge, let him therefor seeke the Law at their mouth: (Mal. 2.7. That by conference with some learned an godly Minister; the knots being vnloosed and the hard shell broken to his hand hee may through GODS blessing, at th last attaine vnto the sweetnesse of th Kernell, which is the true sence of Scrip¦ture. Which worke, now some yeeres past I hauing finished; and at the first onset, in∣tended for my owne priuate: Notwith¦standing by the incouragement of som learned, and instigation of other Christia friends, I haue yeelded the same, as tho
seest, to the Presse, for the vse of many. By which my labour, if thou findest thy selfe any thing helped in thy ioy, or some other way Christianly edyfied (leauing the Instrument to vanish in his owne obscurity) let thine eyes bee fixed on him, who by the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings, is able to make perfect his owne praise. Vnto whose Grace I commend thee. Thine, if his owne, F. B.
The Author would desire the Rea∣der, to Correct such escapes, of th Presse as  shall meet withall; whic for lac  e and leisure coul not bee p .

2 He was created after God, in righ∣teousnesse and true holinesse. Ephes. 4.24. 3 In dignity, he was made a little lower than the Angels, and was crowned with glory and honour, and was made to haue dominion ouer the worke of Gods hands, who did put all things vnder his feet: Ps. 8 5.6. Gen. 1.28. Q. Did he continue so? A. No: for hee did eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill; of which the Lord said, thou shalt not eat of it: Gen. 2.17. 3.6. whereby he like man, transgressed the couenant, and trespassed against God: Hos. 6.7. And so sinne entring into the world, all men by him haue sinned: Rom. 5.12. Q. What followed this his trans∣gression? A. 1 Mans vnderstanding is thereby darkned, and hee is become a stranger from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in him: Ephes. 4.18. Col. 1.21. Rom. 3.11. euen a beast by his owne knowledge: Ier. 10.14. & 51.17. and like a wild Ass colt, Iob 11.12. and much worse, Isai. 1.3.
wise hee is to doe euill; but to doe good hee hath no knowledge: Ierem. 4.22. and in the thing he professeth himselfe to be wise, hee is become a foole. Rom. 1.22. and 8.5. 2 Cor. 3.5. 2 Mans will is thereby also peruer∣ted: for hereby the wickednesse of man is great in the earth, and euery imagination of the thoughts of his heart is onely and conti∣nually euill, Gen. 6.5. & 8.21. And there is no iust man on earth that doeth good, and sinneth not: Eccles. 7.20. There is none righteous, no not one, &c. they haue all gone out of the way, they haue been made altoge∣ther vnprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one, &c. Rom. 3.10, 12. And if any man say he hath not sinned, hee ma∣keth him a lyer, and the truth is not in him. 1 Iohn 1.10. For who can say, I haue made my heart cleane, I am pure from my sinne? Prou. 20.9. And what is man that hee should bee cleane, or the sonne of man that he should be iust? Iob 15.14. This therefore haue I found, that God
hath made man righteous; but he hath sought many inuentions, Eccles. 7.29. Iob 25.4. and 14.4. Isa. 1.5, 6. Rom. 7.18. 3 The wages of sinne is death. (Rom. 6.23.) For as by one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed vpon all men, (Rom. 5.12.) and reigned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them also, that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression, Rom. 5.14. Iob 17.14. CHAP. II. Christ promised. Q. DId God leaue man thus? A. No, For he made a promise a∣fore by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his sonne Iesus Christ, our Lord, Rom. 1.2. Q. Which was the first of that kind? A. That which was made to A∣dam and Eue; concerning whom, God said vnto the Serpent, I will put en∣mity
betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seede and her seede: It shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele: Gen. 3.15. Q. Shew me some more of them, in the manner they were propounded. A. 1 Without exception of doubt, saying; The Lord thy God will raise vn∣to thee a Prophet, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like vnto mee, Deut. 18.15. Hee will bring foorth his seruant the branch, Zach. 3.8. And the man whose name is the branch, hee shall grow vp out of his place, (Zach. 6.12.13.) and shall bee King ouer you, and you shall haue one shep∣heard: Ezech. 37.24.34.24. Ier. 33.17. 2. As vncertaine when, and long to come. For saith Balaam, I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Iacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shal smite the corners of Moab, and destroy the children of Sheth, Numb. 24.17. 3 In a time determined. The Scepter (saith Iacob) shall not depart from Iudah,
nor a lawgiuer from betweene his feete vn∣till Shiloh come. Gen. 49.10. And after threescore and two weekes, , was the Messiah to be cut off. Dan. 9.26. 4 As neere at hand. The Lord (saith Malachi) whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple, euen the Messenger of the Co∣uenant, whom yee delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. Mal. 3.1. 5 As if already come. For vnto vs a child is borne, vnto vs a sonne is giuen; and the gouernement shall be vpon his shoulders, and his name shall be called wonderfull, Counceller, the mighty God, the euer∣lasting Father, the Prince of peace. Isay 9.6. 6 By the place where. For saith Micah, and thou Bethlahem Ephrath, though thou be little among the thousands of Iudah, yet out of thee shall hee come foorth vnto me, that shall be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth haue beene from of old, from euerlasting. Micah 5.2. 7 By the manner how, which was
with much humility. For saith Isaiah, hee shall not cry, nor lift vp, nor cause his voyce to be heard in the streetes. Isa. 42.2. But he shall be poore, and riding vpon an Asse, and vpon a Colt, the foale of an Asse. Zech. 9.9. And he shall grow vp before him as a tender plant, and as a roote out of a dry ground: he hath neither forme nor comeli∣nesse when we shall see him, there shall be no beauty that we should desire him, Isa. 53.2. 8 By his parentage. I will saith God raise vnto Dauid a righteous branch, Ier. 23.5. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Iesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roote. Isa. 11.1. For behold, a Virgin shall conceiue and beare a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Immanuel, Isa. 7.14, 16.5. Ier. 33.15. CHAP. III. Christ exhibited. Q. VVEre these promises fulfilled? A. This day these Scriptures
are fulfilled in your eares, Luke 4.21. For when the fulnesse of time was come, God sent his Sonne made of a woman, (Gal. 4.4.) And of the seed of Dauid hath he according to his promise, raised vnto Israel, a Sauiour Iesus. Acts 13.23.3.18.13, 33. Ob. These are but idle tales, and who so foolish to beleeue them? A. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder & va∣nish away; for I haue wroght a worke in your dais, a work which ye shal not beleeue, if a man would declare it vnto you. Act. 13.41 Ob. All you can say in this matter, is but by flying reports: than which, what is more vncertaine? A. We haue not followed cunningly deui∣sed fables, when wee made knowne vnto you the power, and comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his Maiesty. 2 Pet. 1.16. For the life was made mani∣fest, and we haue seene it, and beare witnesse, and shew vnto you that eternall life, which was with the Father, & was made manifest vnto vs, &c. 1 Ioh. 1.2, &c. Act. 26.23. Q. But yet let vs see how by Scripture
it may bee prooued that Iesus was the Christ. A. Diuers wayes. 1 By the predictions in him fulfilled. As Micha 5.2. with Mat. 2.5. As Hos. 11.1. with Mat. 2.15. As Isa. 40.3. with Mat. 3.3. As Isa. 9 1. with Mat. 4.13.14. As Isa. 53.4. with Mat. 8.17. As Zech. 9.9. with Mat. 21.2. As Isa. 53.9. with 1 Pet. 2.22. As Zach. 11.13 with Mat. 27.7. As Psal. 22.18 with Mat. 27.35. As Isa. 53.1. with Ioh. 12.37, 38. As Psal. 35.19 with Ioh. 15.24.25. As Psal. 109.7. with Ioh. 17.12. As Psal. 2.7. with Acts 13.33. As Exo. 12.46 with Ioh. 19.36. As Zech. 12.10 with Ioh. 19.37. 2 By comparing the types of Christ with the truth. As Psal. 78.2. with Mat. 13.34. As Psal. 69.21. with Mat. 27.48. As Ionah 1.17 with Mat. 12.39. 3 By the witnesses of his comming.
For lo, the Angell of the Lord came vpon  Shepheards by night, and said vnto them Feare not, for behold, I bring you good ti∣dings of great ioy, which shall be to all peo∣ple: for vnto you is borne this day, in the City of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Chris the Lord, Luke 2.8. 2 There came Wisemen from the East to Ierusalem to worship him saying; where is hee that is borne King of the Iewes, for wee have seene his starre in the East. Where upon they being sent by Herod the King to Bethlehem, lo, the starre which they had seene in the East went before them, ti it came, and stood ouer the place where the babe was. Mat. 2.1, 9. 3 There was a man sent from God, whose name was Iohn; thissame came for a wit∣nesse, to beare witnesse of the light, that all men through him might beleeue. Ioh. 1.6, 7, 15. 4 His Disciples came and worshipped him, saying of a truth, thou art the Sonne of God: Math. 14.33. And we beleeue and are sure, that thou art that Christ, &c. Ioh. 6.
69, 11, 27.4.29.39, 41, 42. 1 Ioh. 5.20. 5 The multitude that went before him, and followed, cryed saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. (Mat. 21.9.) And many of the people said, of a truth, this is the Prophet. Others said, this is the Christ. (Ioh. 7.40, 41.) And all men came to him. Ioh. 3.26, & 10.41.42. 6 Many of the chiefe rulers beleeued in him, (Ioh. 12.42.) For the Centurion and they that were with him, said of him, truely this was the sonne of God. (Mat. 27.54.) And Nichodemus, a ruler of the Iewes, said vnto him, Rabby: wee know that thou art a teacher come from God. Ioh. 3.2. 7 The diuell in the man possessed, crying said, what haue wee to doe with thee, Iesus thou sonne of God most high? we be∣seech thee torment vs not. Mat. 8.29. 8 God the Father, who both at his baptisme, (Mat. 3.17.) and transfigu∣ration spake from heauen saying, this is my beloued sonne, in whom I am well plea∣sed,
heare yee him. Mat. 17.5. Iohn 5.32. 2 Pet. 1.17, 9 God the Sonne beareth witnesse of himselfe, saying, that hee was the Sonne of God. Mat. 27.11.43. who though he doe beare record of himselfe, yet his record is true, Ioh. 8.14. 10 God the holy Ghost, when at his baptisme, the heauens opened vnto him, Iohn saw the Spirit of God descending like a Doue, and lighting vpon him, Math. 3.16. 11 Hee that beleeueth in the Sonne of God, hath the witnesse in himselfe, and hee that beleeueth not, hath made God a lyer, because hee beleeueth not the record God gaue of his Sonne, (1 Ioh. 5.10.) and so shall dye in his sinnes, Ioh. 8.24. Ob. Notwithstanding these so many witnesses, that which you doe auouch concerning this man is questioned by many, both Turks, and Pagans. A. Flesh and blood can not reueale these things vnto them, (Mat. 16.17.) nei∣ther can any man say, that Iesus is the Lord,
but by the holy Ghost, (1 Cor. 12.3.) nor come vnto Christ, except the Father draw him. Onely they which haue heard, and haue learned of the Father, doe come vnto him, Ioh. 6.44, 45. Ioh. 5.44. Ob. Not only those of the Gentiles, but many of the Iewes also, which were his owne, receiued him not, Ioh. 1.11. And his brethren did not beleeue in him. Ioh. 7.5. Mat. 13.55, 56. A. A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne Countrey, Mat. 13.57. And did you neuer reade in the Scrip∣tures: The stone which the builders reie∣cted, the same is become the head of the corner? Mat. 21.42. Yet Apolloes helped them much which had beleeued through grace. Acts 18.28. And Paul mightily conuinced the Iewes, and that publikely, shewing by the Scrip∣tures, that Iesus was the CHRIST. Acts 9.22. & 17.2.3. Q. But what signe did he shew, that wee also may see and beleeue in him?
A. The blinde receiued their sight, the lame did walke, the leopers were cleansed, the deafe did heare, and the dead were raised vp. Mat. 11.5. Thus this Iesus of Nazareth was ap∣proued of God by miracles, wonders a d¦signes, as the Iewes themselues could not de∣ny. (Acts 2.22.) So as when that Christ commeth, will hee doe more miracles than this man hath done? (Ioh. 7.31) But if he wrought such works, as no meere man euer did; although yee beleeue not him, yet be∣leeue the workes, that yee may know, and be∣leeue that the Father was in him, and he in him. Ioh. 10.37, 38.14.10.11. Heb. 2.4. Q. But did he not worke these works by the power of Satan, and by Beelzebub cast out diuels? A. If this man had not beene of God, he could haue done nothing: (Ioh. 9.33:) Therefore not Satan, but the Father that dwelleth in him, hee did the workes (Ioh. 14.10) For can the diuell open the eyes of the blinde? (Ioh. 10.21.) Euery King∣dome diuided against it selfe, shall not
stand, &c. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is diuided against himselfe; how shall then his kingdome stand? &c. But if Christ did cast out diuels by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdome of God is come vnto you, &c. Mat. 12.25, &c. Luke 11.20. And therfore, how long will ye prouoke the Lord? how long will it be ere ye doe beleeue in Iesus for all the signes which hee hath shewed among you? Numb. 14.11. Ioh. 9.16.9.30. Ob. Why then say the Scribes that Eli∣as must first come? A. I say vnto you, that Elias is come al∣ready, and they knew him not: but they haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they listed. Mat. 17.12. Q. For my owne part, I haue no more to say against your allegations, yet want I the comfort and assurance thereof still. A. If you will doe the will of God, you shall know the doctrine alledged to bee of God, and not of man, Ioh. 7.17. And the comforter whom Christ will send vn∣to
you from the Father, euen the Spiri of truth, which proceedeth from the Father he shall testifie of him, and you also shal beare witnesse of him. Iohn 15.26.27. Q. What vse are wee to make o this Doctrine, teaching vs the certainty of Christ being come in the flesh? A. 1. Herein behold your happinesse aboue many who doe see, and heare of these things: for verily I say vnto you, that many Prophets and righteous men haue desired to see those things which you see, and haue not seene them, and to heare those things which yee heare, and haue not heard them, Mat. 13.16.17. 2 According to the voyce of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straigth, (Mark, 1.3.) in the desert, an high way for our God. Isa. 40.3. 3 Reioyce greatly (O daughter of Zion) shoute O daughter of Ierusalem, behold, thy King commeth vnto thee, (Zech. 9.9.) and cry, saying, Hosanna to the son of Dauid, Blessed is hee that commeth in the name of
the Lord, Hosanna in the highest heauens, Mat. 21.9. And Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel, for hee hath visited and redeemed his people; and he hath raised vp a horne of saluation for vs in the house of his seruant Dauid, as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which haue beene since the world beganne, Luke 1.68, &c. Luke 1.54, 55, 46; 47. Mat. 23.39. Mar. 11.10. 4 Oh Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee vp into the high mountaines of Ie∣rusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift vp thy voyce, be not afraide, say vnto the Ci∣ties of Iudah, behold, your God, (Isa. 52.7) and to the daughters of Zion, behold, thy sal∣uation is come; behold, his reward is with him, and his worke before him, Isa 62.11. 5 Then if any man shall say vnto you, Lo heere is Christ, or lo there, beleeue it not: For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders; insomuch, that if it were possible, they shall deceiue the very Elect. Behold, I haue told you before; wherefore if they shall say vnto you, Behold, he is in the desert, goe
not forth, behold, hee is in the secret cham∣bers, beleeue it not, &c. Mat. 24.23, &c. Ob. If these tydings be so good, why is Christ said to be a stumbling-blocke and a rocke of offence to both the houses of Is∣rael? Isa. 8.14. A. Vnto you which beleeue hee is preci∣ous; onely vnto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, And i stone of stumbling, and a rocke of offence euen to them that stumble at the Word, be∣ing disobedient; whereunto also they wer appoynted. 1 Pet 2.7.8. Isa. 59.20. CHAP. IIII. Ʋnion with CHRIST. Q. VVHat interest haue belieuers in Christ, thus promised and exhibited? A. Christ is wholly ours: for he came vnto his owne, (Ioh. 1.11.) And vnt vs a Sonne is borne, and vnto vs a child iuen. Isa. 9.6.
Q. By what meanes came Christ to bee ours? A. By being vnited vnto him: for we are in him that is true, euen in the Sonne of God, Iesus Christ, (1 Ioh. 5.20.) For saith hee, Father, I will that they may be one, as thou O Father art in mee, and I in thee, that they may be one in vs, I in them, and thou in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one. Ioh. 17.21, 23. He therefore that is ioyned to the Lord is one spirit, 1 Cor. 6.17. for in the dispensation of the fulnes of times he doth gather toge∣ther in one, all things in Christ, both which are in heauen, and which are in earth, euen in him. Ephes 1.10. Ioh. 14.20.17.11. Q. By what similitudes, doth the Scrip∣ture set out this our vnion with Christ? A. They are many. 1 Of a building: For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a tryed stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation. Isa. 28.16. And other foundation can no man laie then that which is laid, which is Iesus Christ. 1 Cor. 3.11. In whom all the building fitly framed to∣gether,
groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lord, Ephes. 2.21. 2 Of house and inhabitants. Christ as a sonne is ouer his own house, whose house are we, (Heb. 3.7.) In whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit, (Eph. 2.22.) who dwelleth in you, (1 Cor. 3.16.) and maketh his aboade with you, Iohn 14.23.6.56. 1 Cor. 6.19. 3 Of consanguinity. For both he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, be∣ing all one, hee is not ashamed to call them brethren, (Heb. 2.11.) But doth professe that whosoeuer doth the will of God, is his brother, sister, and mother, Mark. 3.35. 4 Of husband and wife, vnto whom we are betrothed and espowsed, (Hos. 2.19, 20 2 Cor. 11.2.) euen as the bride-grome to the bride, (Ioh. 3.29,) where∣by our maker is become our husband, Isa. 54.5. And is the head of his Church, as the husband is the head of his wife, Eph. 5.23. 5 Of head and members. Hee is the head of the body, the Church, Col. 1.18. and
we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, (Eph. 5.30.) for as the body is one & hath many members, & all the mem∣bers of that one body, being many are one bo∣dy, so also is Christ, 1 Cor. 12.12. Know ye not therefore that your bodies are the members of Christ? 1 Cor. 6.15. Ephes. 1.22, 23. Collos. 1.24. Rom. 12.4, 5. 6 Of the vine and branches. Where∣of Christ is the vine, and we are the bran∣ches, Iohn 15.5. Q. What may this our Vnion with Christ teach? A. To examine and to prooue your owne selues; Kow yee not your owne selues, how that Iesus Christ is in you, except yee be reprobates? 2 Cor. 13.5. Q. Lay me down some marks wherby our vnion with Christ may be known. A. 1 Because Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith, Ephes. 3.17. Therefore, examine your selues whether you bee in the faith, 2 Cor. 13.5. 2 Heereby we know that hee abideth in vs, by the Spirit which he hath giuen vs.
1 Iohn 3.24. But if any man haue not the spirit of Christ, the same is not his, Rom. 8.9. 1 Ioh. 4.13. 3. Whosoeuer shall confesse that Iesus is the Sonne of God, dwelleth in him, and he in God. 1 Ioh. 4.15. 4. By this shall all men know that you are his Disciples, if yee haue loue one to another. (Ioh. 13.5.) God is loue, and he that dwel∣leth in loue, dwelleth in God & God in him. 1 Ioh. 4.16.1.4.11, 12:1.2.9.10. 5. Whosoeuer abideth in him, sinneth not; whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene him, nor knowne him, 1 Ioh. 3.6. But he that keepeth the commandements dwelleth in him, and he in him, 1 Ioh. 3.24: Ioh. 15.5.6:13.18. Gal. 5.24. Q. What if vpon due examination I doe find my selfe to be out of Christ? A. For this cause, bow your knees vnto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, &c. that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that you beeing rooted and grounded in loue, may be able to comprehend
with al Saints, what is the bredth & length, and depth and height, & to know the loue of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulnes of God. Eph. 3.14. Q. What if I find my selfe to be in Christ? A. Then cleane fast vnto him without sepa∣ration, 1 Cor. 7.35. And hold the head, from which all the body, by ioynts & bands hauing nourishment ministred, & knit together, in∣creaseth with the encrease of God Col. 2.19. 2. He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himselfe also to walke, euen as he walked (1 Ioh. 2.6.) For in Christ Iesus, neither cir∣cumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncir∣cumcision, but a new creature. Gal, 6.15. Therefore, hauing put on the Lord Iesus Christ, make no prouision for the flesh, to ful∣fill the lusts thereof: Rom. 13.14: Rom. 7.4. Col. 2.6.7. Gal. 5.24. Q. What followeth vpon this our vnion with Christ? A. Our cōmunion. God is faithfull by whom yee were called vnto the fellowship of his Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, 1. Cor. 1.9.
For saith he, I stand at the doore and knock, if any heare my voice, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and hee with mee: Reuel 3.20. Cant. 5.1. Prou. 9.1, &c. Q. Wherein haue we communion with Christ? A. In his life. For because hee liueth, you shall liue also: (Iohn 14.19) And As the liuing Father sent him, and hee liueth by the Father; so hee that eateth him shall liue by him: (Iohn 6.57.) For in him was life, and the life was the light of man. (Iohn 1.4.) whereby wee liue, yet not wee any more, but Christ liueth in vs. Galat. 2.20. Ephes. 5.14. Rom. 6.8. 2 Cor. 4.10. Iohn 11.25, 14.6. 2 In his sufferings, who being lifted vp from the earth, hee doth draw all men vnto him, (Ioh. 12.32.) who are crucified with him, Gal. 2.20. 3 In his death, Know ye not, that so ma∣ny of vs as were baptized into Iesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Rom. 6.3. 4 In his buriall. Therefore wee are
buried with him in baptisme, into death, Rom. 6.4. Col. 2.12. 5 In his resurrection. We are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead: (Col. 2.12.) For if the Spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that hath raised vp Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortall bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you, Rom. 8.11, and 6.5. 6 In his ascention, making vs to sit to∣gether in heauenly places, in Christ Iesus: Ephes. 2.6. Q. Had the Fathers who liued be∣fore Christ this communion with him? A. Brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were vnder the cloud, and all passed thorow the Sea, and were all baptized vnto Moses in the cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eate the same spirituall meate, and did all drinke the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spirituall rocke that followed them, and that rock was Christ, 1 Cor. 10.1. & Ioh. 8.56.
Q. What then may this our Com∣munion with Christ teach vs? A. 1 Not to know any thing saue Iesus Christ, & him crucified, 1 Cor. 2.2. To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, beeing made conformable vnto his death: Phil. 3.10. Col. 3.1. 2. To walke worthy of him, 1 Thes. 2.12. For this is the message we haue heard of him, and declare vnto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkenesse at all. If wee say we haue fellowship with him, and walke in darknesse, we lye and do not truely: but if we walke in the light, as hee is in the light, wee haue fellowship one with another: 1 Ioh. 1.5. Q. What followeth vpon this our vnion, and communion with Christ? A. 1 If wee be one body in Christ, wee are euery one anothers members, Rom. 12.8. Ephes. 4.25. 1 Cor. 12.27. 2 There is a community among these members, (Act. 4.32.) Whereby in giuing and receiuing one doth communi∣cate vnto another, (Phil. 4.15.) And so are
comforted, by the mutuall faith each of o∣ther: Rom. 1.11.12 Q. What doth this our vnion with the members of Christ teach vs? A. To keepe the vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Eph. 4.3, &c. And to let this peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which you are also called in one body, (Col. 3.15.) And all speaking one thing, there may be no diuision among you; but that yee be per∣fectly ioyned together in the same mind, and in the same iudgement, 1 Cor. 1.10. Ephes. 4.15, 16. Psalm. 133.1, 2. Gen. 13.8, 9. Pro. 15.17:17.1.17.9.14: Eccl. 4.6. Col. 3.8.9, 10. Iames 4.1. Rom. 14.19. 2 Cor. 13.11. Q. What doth our communion with these members teach vs? A. 1 That no man seeke his owne wealth, but euery one one anothers wealth, (1 Cor. 10.24.) Reioycing with them that reioyce, and weeping with them that weepe, and to be of the like affections one towards another, Rom 12.15, 16. Whereby, if one member suffer, all the mēbers suffer with it, or if one
member bee honoured, all the members re∣ioyce with it, 1 Cor. 12.26. 2 Because all members haue not the same office, Rom. 12.4. But haue gifts that are diuers, (Rom. 12.6.) Such as are strong ought to beare with the infirmities of the weake, not pleasing themselues, but let e∣uery man please his neighbour in that which is good, to the vse of edification, Rom. 15.1.2.3. 1 Cor. 12.14, &c. Q. I would gladly heare you to ex∣presse yet more fully what wee are the beter for this vnion, and communion with Chrst? A. My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory, by Christ Iesus: (Phil. 4.19.) By whom all things are yours, &c. (1 Cor. 3.21, &c.) which doe appertaine vnto life, and godlinesse, through the knowledge of him that hath called vs to glory and vertue: (2 Pet. 1.3.) For hee that hath giuen Christ vnto vs, how shall he not with him also freely giue vs all things? Rom. 8.32. Mar. 2.27. 2 Cor. 4.15. Ioh. 1.16. Col. 2.10. 1 Cor. 1.5.
Q. What may the consideration of this teach vs? A. To doe as the wise Marchant did, who seeing good pearles, when hee had found one pearle of great price, he went and sold all that hee had to buy the same: Math. 13.44, &c. Q. What spirituall blessings are with Christ to be had? A. Of him are wee in Christ Iesus, who is of God made vnto vs righteousnesse, and sanctification, 1 Cor. 1.30. Q. How shall man bee iust with God? Iob 9.2.25.4. A. Christ Iesus, who knew no sinne, be∣came sinne for vs, that wee might be made the righteousnesse of God in him: (2 Cor. 5.21.) For as by one mans disobedience ma∣ny were made sinners; so by the obedience of one, shall many be made righteous. Rom. 5.19. Isa. 53.9.53 11.12: Ezek. 16.9. Ob. But what did Christ in our be∣halfe, that could be auaileable for righ∣teousnesse, either for the fathers who liued so many yeeres before him, or
vnto vs who doe liue so long after? A. By one offcring, he hath perfected for euer them that are sanctified: whereof also, the holy Ghast is a witnesse: (Heb. 10.14, 15.) Not that Christ should offer him∣selfe often, as the high Priests entred into the holy place, euery yeere with the blood of others; for then must he often haue suffered since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the world, hath he ap∣peared to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe: Heb. 9.25.10.18. Q. Is then the guiltinesse, and pu∣nishment of sin taken away by Christ? A. This is a faithfull saying, and worthy all acceptance, that Christ Iesus came into the world to saue sinners, 1 Tim. 1.15. And you know that he was made manifest, that he might take away our sins, (1 Ioh. 3.5.) who his own selfe bare our sins in his own body on the Tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. which was prefigu∣red by the scape-gote, (Leu. 16.21, 22.) Thus it is written, and thus it behoued Christ to suffer, and that remission of sinnes should bee preached in his name among all
Nations, beginning at Ierusalem: Luke 24.26.27. Be it knowne vnto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached vnto you the forgiuenesse of sinnes: Act. 13.38. Math. 9.2:1.21. Reuelat. 1.5, 6. Ioh. 1.29. Ob. By what authority did hee these thing? And who gaue vnto Christ this au∣thority to forgiue sinnes? Math. 12.23. Mar. 2.7. A. As no man tooke this honour to him∣selfe, (to offer for sin) but he that was cal∣led of God as was Aaron: So also Christ glo∣rified not himselfe to bee made an high Priest; but hee that said vnto him, Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee, he gaue it him, (Heb. 5.4.) And hath exalted him with his right hand, to be a Prince, and Sauiour, for to giue repentance vnto Israel, and forgiuenesse of sinnes, (Act. 5.31,) But that yee may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgiue sins (he saith to one sicke of the palsie) I say unto thee, arise and take vp thy bed; who immediatly arose,
and took vp his bed, and went forth among them all. Mar. 2.10. &c. Q. What witnesses can you produce to conuince vs of remission of sinnes by Christ? A. Caiaphas (though his enemy) yet being high priest, professed that Iesus should dye for the Nation of he Iewes, and not for that Nation only, but that also hee should gather together in one, the Children of God, that were scattered abroad, (Ioh. 1.51, 52.) To whom also giue all the Prohets witnesse, That through his name whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should receiue remission of sinnes, (Acts 10.43.) This is hee that came b water and blood; euen Ie∣sus Christ, not by water onely, but by water and blood; and it is the Spirit that beareth witnesse, because the Sprit is truth. For there are three that beare record in heauen; the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost; and these three are one: And there are three that beare witnesse in earth; the Spirit, and water, and blood: and these three agree in one. Ioh. 15.6, &c. Q. But wil God make good their testimony?
A. If we confesse our sinnes, hee is faith∣full and iust to forgiue vs our sinne, (1 Ioh. 1.9.) For when Dauid said vnto Na∣than, I haue sinned: Nathan said vnto Dauid, The LORD also hath put away thy sinne: 2 Sam. 12.13. Isa. 6.5, &c. 2 Chro. 7.14. Mat. 18.26, 27. Luk. 15.18, &c. Q. Is there no forgiuenesse of sinne without confession? A. Hee that couereth his sinnes shall not prosper; onely, hee that confesseth and for∣sakes his sins shall haue mercy, Pro. 28.13. For saith Dauid, When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long, &c. I acknowledged my sinne vn∣to thee, and mine iniquity haue I not hid: I said I will confesse my transgressions, and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sinne. Psalm. 32.3, &c. Luke 15.18. Q. What are the sinnes which God, for Christs sake will forgiue? A. He will cleanse them from all their in∣iquities; whereby they haue sinned against him, and he will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they haue sinned and whereby they
haue transgressed against him. Ier. 33.8. And the blood of Iesus Christ his Son, clean∣seth vs from all sinne: 1 Ioh. 1.7. Psal. 130.8:85.2. Q. How farre foorth doth God for∣giue sinnes? A. To the vtmost extent thereof: For, 1 God was in Christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe, not imputing their trespasses vnto them, 2. Cor. 5.19. 2 As not seene, For he hath not beheld iniquity in Iacob, neither hath hee seene per∣uersenesse in Israel, (Numb. 23.21.) Where∣by when the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, there shall be none, and the sinnes of Iudah, and they shall not be found, &c. Ierem. 50.20. Isa. 38.17. Psalm. 85.2. Ezek. 16.8. 3. As not remembred, For he will be mercifull vnto our vnrighteousnesse, and our sinnes, and iniquities wil he remember no more: Heb. 8.12. 4 As far away remoued, For as hea∣uen is high aboue the earth, so great is his mercy towards them that feare him: as farre
as the East is from the West, so farre hath he remooued our transgressions from vs, Psal. 103.11, 12. 5 As swallowed vp. He will turne a∣gaine, hee will haue compassion vpon vs, hee will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sinnes into the depth of the sea, Micah 7.19. 7 As a cloud vanished. Hee hath blotted out as a thicke cloude our trans∣gressions, and as a cloude our sinnes Isai. 44.22. 7 As a writing defaced. I, saith God, euen I am he that blotteth out thy transgres∣sions. Isai. 43.25. Q. Why? is the curse of sinne with the guilt taken away by Christ? A. GOD sent not his Sonne into the World to condemne vs, but that wee through him might bee saued, (Iohn 3.17.) For surely hee hath borne our griefes, and carried our sorrowes, &c. Hee was wounded for our transgressions, hee was bruised for ouri-niquities, the chastise∣ment of our peace was vpon him, and with
his stripes we are healed, &c. Isa. 53.4.5. There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, Rom. 8.1. For he hath redeemed them from the curs of the Law, by being made a curse for them: as it is written, Cursed is euery one that hangeth on a tree. Gal. 3.13: Rom. 5.14, &c. Ioh. 3.17. Q. What moued the Lord, through Christ to take away our sinnes? A. We haue redemption through his blood, the forgiuenesse of sinnes, according to the riches of his grace, (Ephes. 1.7.) And for his owne names sake, (1 Ioh. 2.12.) If the Lord indeed should marke iniquities, who should stand? But there is forgiuenesse with him, that he may be feared: Psalm. 130.3, 4: Ezech. 20.44: Isa. 43.21. Q. What would you infer vpon this so rich and plentious grace of God? A. Euen as Dauid, who describeth the blessednesse of the man, vnto whom God im∣puteth righteousnesse without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgi∣uen, and whose sinnes are couered; Bles∣sed is the man vnto whom the Lord will
not impute sinne, Romans 4.67.8. Ob. This blessednesse might belong to Abraham, and such as hee was, but not vnto mee, and such as I am? A. It was not written for his sake alone, that it was not imputed, but vnto vs also to whom it shall not be imputed, if wee beleeue on him that raised vp Iesus our Lord from the dead, Rom. 4.23. 1 Tim. 1.16. Ob. Many alas are the duties I might haue performed, which I haue foolish∣ly omitted? A. He will not reproue thee for thy sa∣crifices, or thy burnt offerings, to haue beene continually before him, Psalm. 50.8. Ob. Multitudes of actuall transgres∣sions, also haue I committed, some of ignorance, or without obseruation, ma∣ny whereof are out of minde and for∣gotten. A. Who can vnderstand hts errours? Therefore say vnto God, Cleanse thou mee from my secret faults, (Psalm. 19.12.) For as the high priest, vnder the Law went alone, once euery yeere, not without blood,
which he offered for himselfe, and for the er∣rours of the people, (Hebr. 9.7. Leu. 4.2, &c. 5.15, &c.) So CHRIST Iesus by his owne blood entred into the holy place, hauing obtained eternall redemption for vs, Hebr. 9.12: Acts 3.17.19. 1 Tim. 1.13: Luke 7.47: Psalme 78.40.41: Acts 13.18: Psal. 78, 38.39. Ob. But I haue sinned also of knowledge, yea, presumptuously, and with an high hand. A. Come now, let vs reason together, saith the LORD, though your sinnes be as scarlet, they shall bee as white as snow; though they bee red like crimson, they shall bee as wooll, (Isai, 1.18.) For verily I say vnto you, all manner of sinnes and blasphemies shall be forgi∣uen vnto men. Math. 12.31: Leu. 5.13.6.5.6.7. Leu. 19.20, &c. Luk. 7.47. 2 Chro. 33.9, &c. 1 Tim. 1.3. Act. 9.1.26.9, &c. 1 Tim. 1.13, 15: Micah 7.18.19. Deut. 9.19: Luk. 15.13. Ob. But I haue long liued in the pra∣ctise of these horrible wickednesses.
A. As the Labourer working but one houre had his penny, (Mat. 20.8.) And the thiefe on the Crosse his para∣dise, (Luke 23.43.) So when the wic∣ked man turneth away from his wicked∣nesse that hee hath committed, and doeth that which is lawfull and right, he shall saue his soule aliue. Because hee considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that hee hath committed, hee shall sure∣ly liue, hee shall not dye: Ezekiel 18.27.28. Ob. Whatsoeuer you can say to the contrary, my owne conscience tels me, that I am no better then a condemned man. A. As for the wickednesse of the wic∣ked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that hee turneth from his wickednesse, (Ezechiel 33.12.) For when God saith vnto thee, Thou shalt surely dye, if thou turne from thy sinne, and doe that which is lawfull and right, &c. thou shalt surely liue, thou shalt not die, &c. Ezek. 33; 14.15.19.
Q. If the Lord should pardon vs many thousands of times, yet shall wee continue to prouoke him still? A. My little children, these things I write vnto you that you sinne not: And if any man doe sinne, wee haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for all our sinnes: (1 Ioh. 2.2.) For whose sake the Lord is slow to anger, and plentifull in mercy, (Psal. 103.8.) Long suffering, abounding in goodnesse and truth, keeping mercy for thou∣sands, forgiuing iniquity, transgression, and sinne, (Exod. 34 6.) Yea, for his names sake will he deferre his anger; and for his praise will he refraine from thee, that hee cut thee not off: Isa. 48.9: Psal. 40.11, 12:86, 5: Neh. 9.26, &c. Ob. There is no man liuing that will forgiue after this manner; how then should I in the conscience of so much guiltinesse, dare to looke God in the face? A. Gods thoughts are not as your thougths, neyther are his wayes your wayes: For as the
heauens are higher then the earth, so are his wayes higher then your wayes, and his thoughts, then your thoughts, (Isa. 55.7, 8, 9.) For you say, if a man put away his wife, and she goe from him, and become another mans; shall he returne vnto her againe? shall not the Land be greatly polluted? Notwith∣standing, though thou hast played the harlot with many louers, yet returne againe vnto mee saith the Lord: Ierem. 3.1. Ob. But besides my sinne and guil∣tinesse, my very righteousnesses are but as filthy ragges, Isa. 64.6. A. Christ Iesus he was holy, harme∣lesse, vndefiled, separate from sinners. Heb. 7.26. And is the end of the Law for righ∣teousnesse vnto euery one that beleeueth? (Rom. 10.4.) For which cause, this is the name by which he was called, The Lord our righteounesse: Ier. 33.6. Math. 3.15: Cant. 1.5: Zech. 3.3, 4. Ob. But the Law seemes to impose a curse vpon those that performe not as well personall, as perfect obedience vnto the same: Deut. 27.26.
A. The Law is not made for a righteou man, but for the Lawlesse and disobedient For the vngodly and prophane, for murthe¦rers of fathers, for murtherers of mothers for man-slayers, for them that defile them∣selues with mankind; for man-stealers, for lyars, for periured persons, and if there be a∣ny other thing, that is contrary to sound Doctrine 1 Tim. 1.9. Q. These things were good indeed if my heart could be drawne to beleeue them. A. Christ Iesus beeing ascended vp vnto the Father, will send the Comfor∣ter vnto you. And when he is come, he will conuince you of righteousnesse; and that vpon this ground; Because he goeth vn∣to the Father, and you shalt see him no more: Ioh. 16.7. Q. What is our worke wee haue to doe for the furthering and procu∣ring of our owne iustification? A. This is the worke of God, that yee beleeue on him whom hee hath sent, (Ioh. 6.29.) And the iust shall liue by faith, Hab. 2.4.
For what saith the Scripture? Abra∣ham beleeued GOD, and it was accounted vnto him for righteousnesse. Rom. 4.3. Galathians 3.6.8. Iames 2.23. Rom. 3.21.22 For the Scripture foreseeing that GOD would iustifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before the Gospell vnto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the Gentiles (being in themselues full of all vnrighteousnesse: Rom. 1.29.) be blessed: Gal. 3.8. Ob. But was not Abraham our Fa∣ther iustified by workes, when hee had offered Isaac his Sonne vpon the Altar, (Iames 2.21.) And will you heerein so include faith, as wholly to exclude workes? Iames 2.24. A. By workes Abraham was mani∣fested, but not made iust: Iames 2.18. Moreouer, that no man is iustified by the Law; it is euident for the iust shall liue by Faith, (Galathians 3.11.) And when wee were yet of no strength, CHRIST dyed for the vngodly, (Romanes 5.6.) to declare at this time
his righteousnesse that he might be iust, an a iustifier of him which beleeueth in Iesu (Rom. 3.26.) By whom all that beleeu are iustified from all things, from whic they could not bee iustified by the Law  Moses, (Acts 13.39.) And to him tha worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iu∣stifieth the vngodly, his faith is accounte vnto him for righteousnesse, Rom. 4.5. Moreouer, the Law is weake through th flesh, (Rom. 8.3.) And all hauing sinnes (Rom. 3.23.) by the Law comes the know∣ledge of sinne, (Rom. 3.20.) Whereby, s many as are of the workes of the Law, ar vnder the curse. Gal. 3.10. Whereupon the Gentiles which follow∣ed not righteousnes, haue attained to righte∣ousnes; euen the righteousnesse which is of faith. But Israel which followed after the Law of righteousnes, hath not attained the Law of righteousnes, wherefore? because they sought it not by faith; but as it were by the workes of the Law: For they stumbled at the stumbling stone, (Rom. 9.30.) And if Abraham were iustified by workes, he hath
whereof to glorie, but not before GOD, Rom. 4.2. Seeing then it is one God, which shall iustifie the circumcision by faith, and vncir∣cumcision through faith, (Rom. 3.30.) Therefore wee conclude, that a man is iusti∣fied by faith without the deeds of the Law: Rom. 3.28: 1 Cor. 4.4: Rom. 3, 21, 22. Gal. 2.16:3.8.4.3.2. Ob. But there rose vp certaine of the sect of the Pharises which beleeued, saying, That it was needfull to circumcise them, and commanded to keepe the whole Law of Moses. Acts 15.5. A. Men and brethren, you know, how that a good while agoe, God made choyce a∣mong vs, that the Gentiles by my mouth should heare the Word of the Gospell, and be∣leeue; now therefore these men did but tempt God, in putting a yoke vpon the necke of the Disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we were able to beare: Acts 15.7.10. Ob. Moses himselfe describeth the righ∣teousnesse which is of the Law, that the man which doth those things shall liue by them?
A. But the righteousnesse which is  faith speaketh on this wise, Say no thou in thine heart, Who shall ascen into Heauen, that is, to bring downe CHRIST from aboue? Or who shal descend downe into the deepe, that is, to bring CHRIST from the dead? But what saith it? The Word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that is, the Word of faith which wee preach. And which with the heart wee beleeue vnto righteousnesse: Rom. 10.6. Q. Is the Law then against the promise? A. GOD forbid. For if there had beene a Law giuen which could haue giuen life, verily, righteousnesse should haue beene by the Law; but the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise of the faith of IESVS CHRIST might bee giuen to them that beleeue. Gal. 3.21. Q. If righteousnesse be not by the
Law; why was it exhibited? The Law was added because of trans∣gressions, till the Seed should come, to whom the promise was made, Galathi∣ans 3.19. And it was our Schoolemaster to bring vs to Christ: Gal. 3.24. Moreouer, the Law entred that the offence might abound; but where sinne abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sinne had reigned vnto death, so might grace reigne through righte∣ousnesse, vnto eternall life, by IESVS CHRIST our Lord: Romanes 5.20, 21. Ob. But if while wee seeke to bee iustified by CHRIST, wee our selues are found sinners; Is therefore Christ the minister of sinne? Gal. 2.17 A. GOD forbid. For if I builde againe the things which I destroyed, I make my selfe a trespasser: For, I through the Law, am deade to the Law, that I might liue vnto GOD:
(Gal. 2.17.) You therefore are as free, an not vsing your liberty for a cloke of malici∣ousnesse, but as the seruants of God, (1 Pet 2.16.) But if ye are lead by the spirit, ye ar not vnder the Law, (Gal. 5.18.) The fruit whereof, is loue, ioy, peace, long-suffering, gentlense, goodnes, faith, meeknes, tēperance; against such there is no Law: Gal. 5.22. Q. You haue well satisfied me in the article of iustification, tell me therefore what vse I am to make thereof? A. 1 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the vnrighteous man his thoughts, and let him returne vnto the Lord; for hee will haue mercy vpon him, and to our God; for hee will abundantly pardon, (Isai. 55.7.) and will blot out their sinnes, when the time of refreshing shall come: Acts 3.19. But if they will not obey his voyce, let them beware of him; for hee will not pardon their transgressions, (Exo. 23.21.) But the soule that doth presumptuously, shall be cut off from among his people: Numbers 15.30, 31. 2. Take vnto you words, and turne vn∣to
the Lord, and say vnto him; Take away all iniquity, and receiue vs graciousty, (Hosea 14.2.) Pardon I beseech thee mine iniquities according to the greatnesse of thy mercies, (Numb. 14.19.) And enter not in∣to iudgement with thy seruant, for in thy sight shall no man liuing be iustified. Psal. 143.2. and 41.4.51.1, &c. 25.11. 3 Because when you haue thus praied, the Lord wil say, I haue pardoned according to thy words, Num. 14.20. therfore hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plentifull redemption Psal. 130.7:131.3. 4 Say, Who is a God like vnto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the trans∣gresions of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for euer, because he delighteth in mercy, Micah 7.18. Psal. 103.1, &c. Isa. 44.23. 5 Say, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods children? It is God that iusti∣fieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that is dead, yea rather that is risen againe, who is euen at the right hand of God, who al∣so
maketh intercession for vs, (Rom. 8.33.) For in the Lord shall the seed of Israel be iu∣stified, & shall glory: Isa. 45.25. & 61.10. 6 Account therefore all things but losse for the excellent knowledge of Christ Iesus your Lord. For whom Paul also suffered the losse of all things, and did account them but dung, that he might winne Christ; and be found in him, not hauing his owne righ∣teousnesse which is of the Law; but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousnesse which is of GOD through faith: Phil. 3.8.9. and 3.3, &c.— 7 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled againe in the yoke of bon∣dage: Gal. 5.1. 8 What shall wee say then; shall wee continue still in sinne, that grace may a∣bound? God forbid, (Rom. 6.1, 2.) And shall wee sinne because we are not vnder the Law, but vnder grace? God forbid. For brethren, you haue beene called vnto liberty; onely vse not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, Gal. 5.13: Romanes 7.5, 6: 2 Cor.
5.14, 15. 1 Peter 4.1. &c. Rom. 7.1, &c. 8.12. 9 Be ye kind one to another, tender hear∣ted, forgiuing one another, euen as God for Christs sake hath forgiuen you, (Eph. 4.32.) For if you forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly Father will also forgiue ou: But if you doe not forgiue men their trespas∣ses, no more will your heauenly Father for∣giue you your trespasses: Math. 6.14.15: Col. 3.13: Mat. 18.22. Math. 18.33. CHAP. VI. Reconciliation. Q. YOu hauing thus dispatched the promise of iustification, tell me what grace is that which doth next and immediately flow from it? A. Beeing iustified by faith, wee haue peace towards God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, (Rom. 5.1.) Who is our peace, and hath broke downe the middle wall of parti∣tion
betweene vs, hauing abolished in his flesh the enmity, euen the Law of commande∣ments, contained in ordinances, for to make to himselfe one new man, and so making peace, Eph. 2.14. whereby in Christ Iesus, we who sometimes were farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ: and by him we haue an accesse by one spirit vnto the Father. Ephes. 2.13. Col. 1.21.2.14. 2 Cor. 5.19. 1 Tim. 2.5, Isa. 26.3:27.4. 2 Thes. 3.16. Q. May not this peace and agree∣ment once made, be againe lost? A. Peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue vnto you; not as the world giueth it, giue I vnto you, (Ioh. 14.27.) For this is as the waters of Noah; for as I haue sworne that the waters of Noah should no more go ouer the earth; so haue I sworne, that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee: for the mountaines shall depart, and the hils shall be remoued; but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my peace be remooued, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee: Isa. 54.9. Numb. 25.12 Isa. 9.7. Phil. .7.
Q. What other grace hath this peace with God attending it? A. Ioy in the holy Ghost, (Rom. 14.17.) whereby the meeke shall ioy in the Lord, and the poore among men shall reioyce in the ho∣ly one of Israel, (Isa. 29.19.) And shall be full of ioy with his countenance, (Act. 2.28.) And be satisfied as with marrow, and fatnesse: Psal. 63.5. By meanes whereof Iob had songs in the night, (Iob 35.10.) And Dauid was made exceeding glad with Gods counte∣nance, Psal. 21.6: Nehe. 12.43: Psal. 33.21: Ier. 4.2: Psal. 104.34: Ioh. 15.11: 17.13: Psal. 89.15. Isa. 65.18. Acts 8.39:16.34.13.52. Psa. 4.7. Isa. 9.3. Q. What followeth vpon this our peace and ioy in God? A. 1 Peace with men. For then shall they beat their swords into plowshares, and their speares into pruning hookes; nation shal not lift vp sword against nation, neither shall they learne warre any more, Isa. 2.4. The wolfe shal dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie downe with the kid, and the
calfe, and the young lyon and the fatling to∣gether, and a little child shall lead them. Isa. 11.6. The hatred of Ephaim shall depart, and the aduersaries of Iudah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not enuy Iudah, neither shall Iudah vex Ephraim: Isa. 11.13.65.25. Micha. 4.3. Zech. 3.10. Gen. 21.27. Zech. 9.10. Isa. 66.12. 2 Peace with all other creatures. For they are at league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field, they are at peace with them: Iob. 5.23. Because God hath established his coue∣nant with them, and with their seed after them, and with euery liuing creature; of the fowle, of the cattell, and of euery beast of the earth, (Gen. 9.9.) and with the creeping things of the ground, (Hosea 2.18.) And the feare of them, and the dread of them, shall bee vpon euery beast of the earth, vpon euery fowle of the ayre, vpon all that moueth vpon the earth, & vpō al the fishes of the sea; into their hand are they deliuered: Gen. 9.2. Ob. You tell me of peace and ioy, but behold trouble and sorrow: Ier. 4.10.
A. You now haue sorrow, but your hearts shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you, Ioh. 16.22. For light is sowne for the righteous, & ioy for the vpright in hart: Ps. 97.11. Marke the perfect man, behold the vpright, for the end of that man is peace, (Psal. 37.37.) And though now the earth be moued, and though the mountaines fall into the middest of the Sea; though the wa∣ters thereof rage, and be troubled, and the mountaines shake at the surges of the same; yet there is a riuer whose streame shall make glad the Citty of God, (Psalme 46.2.) Whereby they shall lift vp their voyce, and shall shout for the magnificence of the Lord, and shall reioyce: Isa. 24.14. Q. What are the means whereby this ioy and peace with God, and the crea∣ture, may be maintained? A. 1 Pray, saying, The Lord of peace, giue vs peace, alwayes, by all meanes. (2 Thes. 3.16.) That wee may see the good of thy chosen, that we may reioyce in the gladnesse of thy Nation, that we may glory with thine inheritance, (Psal. 106.5.) Let
the righteous be glad, let them reioyce before thee, yea let them exceedingly reioice, Ps. 68.3.51:8.5.11.40.16.48.11.122, 6.7: 1 Sam. 25.6. 2 The worke of righteousnesse is peace, (Isa. 32.17.) And to as many as walke ac∣cording to this rule, Peace shall be on them, (Gal. 6.16.) I will therefore heare what God the Lord will speake, for he will speake peace vnto his people, and to his Saints: but let them not turne againe to folly, Psal. 85.8. For the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast vp mire, and dirt; There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked: Isa. 57.20.48.22: Rom. 8.6:14.17: Iames 3.18. 2 Corinth. 13.11. 3 If you would haue peace with men, prouide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lyeth in you, liue peaceably with all men, (Rom. 12.18.) And therefore seeke peace and pursue it, (Psal. 34.14.) And follow hard after the things that make for it: Rom. 14.19. 4 Would you haue peace with the
creatures? To the pure, all things are pure, (Titus 1.15.) And euery creature of God is good, if it be receiued with thankes∣giuing: For it is sanctified by the word of God, and by prayer: 1 Tim. 4.4.5. CHAP. VII. Adoption, and Regeneration. Q. What followeth vpon our iustifi∣cation, and reconciliation? A. To be the children of God through faith in Christ Iesus, (Gal. 3.26.) For to as many as receiued him, to them hee gaue this prerogatiue to be his sonnes, euen to them that beleeue in his name, Ioh. 1.12. Who came to redeeme vs that were vnder the Law, that wee might receiue the adoption of sonnes, Gal. 4.5. Behold, therefore what manner of loue the Father hath bestowed vpon vs, that we should be called the sonnes of God: 1 Ioh. 3.1. Math. 5.9. Reuel. 21.7.
Ob. This seemes to be no great mat∣ter, for they liue in no such outward pompe; nay their condition seemes to be worse than other mens: Psal. 73.5. A. The Kingdome of God is not of meat and drinke, (Rom. 14.17.) nor commeth with obseruation; neither shall they say, Lo heere, or lo there: for behold, the Kingdome of God is within you, (Luke 17.20.) and is all glorious there: Psal. 45.13. Q. But what portion, and inheri∣tance hath God for such as be his chil∣dren? A. The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen all things into his hand, (Ioh. 3.35.) In whom we also haue obtained an in∣heritance, (Ephes. 1.11.) For, if we bee children, then are we heyres, heyres of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ: Rom. 8.17. Gal. 4.7. Psal. 16.5. Ob. This belonged vnto Abraham, and to his seed, but not to the sinners of the Gentiles. A. If you be Christs, then are you Abra∣hams seede, and heyres according to pro∣mise,
Gal. 3.29. Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called, that is, they which are the children of the flesh, they are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seede: Rom. 9.7. Now wee brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise, Gal. 4.28.3.7. 1 Pet. 3.6.1.2.10: Luk. 19.9: Mat. 3.9: Ioh. 8.39.47. Hos. 1.10.2.23: Isa. 65.1. Ob. This priuiledge may concerne some great personages of the Gentiles, but not such abiect, and dispised per∣sons as I am. A. Hearken my beloued brethren, hath not God chosen the poore of this world, rich in faith, and heires of the Kingdome which he hath promised to them that loue him, Iames 2.5. For you see your calling, how that not many wise men after the flesh, nor many mighty, nor many noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath
chosen the weake things of the world, confound the things that are mighty; a base things of the world, and things wh are despised hath God chosen, yea, thi which are not, to bring to nought thi that are, that no flesh should glory in presence: 1 Cor. 1.26. Isa. 66.2. Ob. If I could doe some thing wo¦thy of such a reward, there were th some hope. A. God hath called vs, not according workes, but according to his own purpose, a grace whieh was giuen vs in Christ Ies before the world began, 2 Tim. 1.9. For  promise made to Abraham, that he sho be the heyre of the world, was not to ¦braham and his seed through the Law,  through the righteousnesse of faith: For they which are of the Law be heires, faith made voyd, & the promise made of none ¦fect: Ro. 4.13.11.5: Luk. 17.7. Tit. 3.3. Ob. Notwithstanding, it will not o of my minde, but that it is my well d¦ing (if at all) that must enter mee in this estate.
A. This perswasion commeth not of him that calleth you, (Gal. 5.8.) For God sent foorth his Sonne, made of a woman, made vnder the Law to redeeme them that are vnder the Law, that we might receiue the a∣doption of Sonnes, Gal. 4.4.5. And there∣fore tell me, you that desire to be vnder the Law, doe you not heare the Law? For it is written, Cast out the bondwoman, and her sonne, for the sonne of the bondwoman shall not be heyre with the sonne of the freewo∣man: Gal. 4.21. Gen. 21.10. Q. How comes it then to passe, that wee miserable creatures should be so highly exalted? A. We haue not chosen him, but he hath chosen vs, (Ioh. 15.16.) And hath pre∣destinated vs vnto the adoption of children by Iesus Christ, to himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his will, (Ephes. 1.5.11.) For behold the heauen, and the heauen of heauen is the Lords; the earth also, with all things that therein is. Only the Lord hath a delight in vs, & hath chosen vs aboue al peo∣ple, as it is this day: Deu. 10.14. Isa. 60.21. Rom. 11.5.
Ob. Can it bee imagined that me instamped with the diuels image should become the children of God? A, No: For there are also giuen vn¦to vs, great and precious promises, that  these ye might be partakers of the diuine n¦ture, hauing escaped the corruption that  in the world through lust, (2 Pet. 1.4. Wherby we haue put off the old man wit his deeds, and haue put on the new ma which is renewed in knowledge, after th image of him that created vs, Col. 3.9. An are changed into the same image, from glo∣ry, to glory: 2 Cor. 3.18. Q. What are the causes by which this Image of God is wrought in vs? A. 1 Principall efficient, the Spirit of the Lord, (2 Cor. 3, 18.) For we are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man; but of God, (Ioh. 1.13.) That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit: Ioh. 3.6.8: Tit. 3.5. 2 Instrumentall, the word. For of his owne will begat hee vs with the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures, (Iames 1.18.) Being borne againe, not of corruptible seed, but of incor∣ruptible, by the word of God, which liueth and abideth for euer: 1 Pet. 1.23. 3 Ministring; the Preachers who do beget vs by the Gospell, (1 Corinth. 4.15.) And doe trauell in birth vntill Christ bee formed in vs: Gal. 4.19: Isa. 66.8: 1 Cor. 9.1.2. Q. How may we know our selues to haue this image and so to be the chil∣dren of God? A. By these markes, wee know that we are of God; when yet the whole world lyeth in wickednesse: 1 Ioh. 5.19. 1 God himselfe hath sealed vs, and hath giuen the earnest of the spirit in our hearts, (2 Cor. 1.22.) which spirit beareth witnesse with our spirits that wee are the children of God: Rom. 8.16. 2 Hee that beleeueth on the Sonne, hath the witnesse in himselfe, that hee is borne of God: 1 Ioh. 5.10.5.1. 3 He that is of God, heareth Gods word,
Iohn 8.47. And as new borne babes, do desire that sincere milke of the Word, tha he may grow thereby: 1 Peter 2.2. 4 If you know that hee is righteous, you know, euery one that doth righteousnesse, i borne of him, (1 Iohn 2.29.) And being new borne, hee doth not commit sinne, be∣cause his seed remaineth in him, and he can∣not sinne because hee is borne of God. In thi therefore are the children of God knowne, and the children of the diuell, whosoeuer doth not righteously is not of God, 1 Ioh. 3.9.3 Epist. 11: Rom. 8.14. 5 Loue is of God, and euery one that lo∣ueth is borne of God, and knoweth God: 1 Iohn 4.7. 6 Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God. Mat. 5.9. But if you haue bitter enuying, and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not against the truth, (Iames 3.14.) For your spot is not the spot of his children; they that are such, are a crooked and peruerse generation▪ Deut. 32.5. Hosea 1.9: Deut. 32.32, 33. Iohn 8.44: Isa. 57.3.
Q. What may this priuiledge of being the children if God teach vs? A. 1 To pray that the eyes of your vnder∣standing being inlightned, ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance is in the Saints, and what is the exceding great∣nesse of his power to vsward who beleeue, according to the working of his mighty pow∣er: Ephes 1.18. 2 To call no man your father on earth, for one is your father in heauen, (Math. 23.9.) But be yee followers of God as deare children: For yee were once darknesse, now are yee light in the Lord, walke as children of the light, (Ephes. 5.1.8.) And let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen: Math. 5.16: Mal. 1.6: 1 Pet. 1.17. Ephes. 4.30. 3 To looke diligently that there be no pro∣phaine person, as was Esau: who for a morsel of meate sould his birth-right; for you know how that afterwards, when he would haue inherited the blessing he was reiected: For
hee found no place of repentance, though hee sought it carefully with teares: Hebr. 12.15.16. Gen. 25.32: Hosea 3.3. CHAP. VIII. Gods disposition to his children. Q. WHy, what is the disposition o this our Father toward vs? A. 1 When he passed by thee, and looked vpon thee, behold thy time was the time of loue, (Ezeck. 16.8.) For the Father him∣selfe loueth you, (Ioh. 16.27.) Which loue of his was heerein manifested, be∣cause hee sent his onely begotten Sonne into the World, that you might liue through him: 1 Ioh. 4.9. Thus the Lord loueth the righteous, (Psalm. 146.8.) But the wicked, and him that loueth violence, his soule hateth: Psal. 11.5: Prou. 8.17.15.9: Iohn 14.21: 1 Cor. 8.3. Rom. 5.8. 1 Ioh. 3:16.15.9. Ioh. 11.36: Dan. 10.11: Ioh. 17.26: Hos. 14.4. 2 He esteemeth of vs: For the Lords
portion is his people, Iacob the lot of his in∣heritance, (Deut. 32.9: Ierem. 10.16: Psal. 132.13:135.4.) Euen a chosen genera∣tion, a royall Priesthood, a holy nation, a pe∣culiar people, 1 Peter. 2, 9: Reu. 1.6, 5, 10. A crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, a Royall diadem in the hand of their God, (Isa. 62.3.) whereby as one in a certaine place saith, so say I, Lord, what is man that thou art so mindfull of him, or the sonne of man, that thou makest account of him? Heb. 2.6. Psal. 144.3: Iob 7.17: Exo. 19.5. Deut. 14.2: 1 Pet. 3.4. Psalm. 33.12: Isa. 49.16. Pro. 20.15. 3 The Lord taketh pleasure in his peo∣ple, Psal. 149.4. He will reioyce ouer them with ioy, hee will rest in his loue, hee will ioy ouer them with singing: Zeph. 3.17. For saith Christ to his Church, thou art beautifull my loue, as Tirza, comely as Ierusalem, terrible, as an Army with ban∣ners. Turne away thine eyes from mee; for they haue ouercome mee. Cant. 6.4. Behold, thou art faire my beloued, yea, pleasant, also our bed is greene, (Cant. 1.16.
Thou hast rauished my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast rauished my heart, with one of thine eyes, with one chaine of thy necke. How faire is thy loue my sister, my spouse? how much better is thy loue than wine, and the smell of thine oyntments than all spices? Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the hony combe, hony and milke are vnder thy tongue, and the smell of thy garment, is like the smell of Lebanon. Cant. 4.9:7.1.2.2.2.14.3.6.4.7.2 16: Psal. 45.11: Ier. 31.20. Thus as the bridgrome reioyceth ouer the bride, so shall thy God reioyce ouer thee, Isa. 62.5. Isa. 62.4.5.7. Hosea 9.10. Psalme 147.11: Pro. 15.26. Contrarily, the thoughts of the wicked are abomination to the Lord, (Pro. 15.26.) For hee is not a God that taketh pleasure in wickednesse, neither shall euill dwell with him: Psalm. 5.4: Prou. 26.11:15.8. Psalm. 106.39: Amos 6.8: Psalm. 78.59. Leuit. 26.30. 4 He hath a tender care ouer them: For he shall feed his flocke like a sheepheard, he shall gather his lambs with his arme, and
carry them in his bosome, and shall gently lead those that are with young, (Isa. 40.11.) As an eagle stirreth vp her nest, fluttereth ouer her young; spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord alone leadeth his people, and there is no strange God with him, (Deu. 32.11.) And the land also which they pos∣sesse, is a land which the Lord their God ca∣reth for; the eyes of the Lord, their God is alwaies vpon it, from the beginning of the yeere, euen vnto the end of the yeere: Deut. 11.11, 12: 1 Peter 5.7: Hesea 11.3: Cant. 2.6. Moreouer, as a father pittieh his chil∣dren, so the Lord pittieth them that feare him. For hee knoweth their frame, hee re∣membreth that they are but dust: Psal. 103.13: 2 Kings 13.4:13.23.2.14.26, 27. Acts 26.14, 15. Zech. 2.8. Math. 6.25.34. Q. May not this loue of God, and of Christ be through temptation extin∣guished? A. Many waters cannot quench loue,
neither can the floods drowne it. If a man would giue all the substance of his house for loue, it would vtterly be contemned: Cant. 8.7. Who then shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? (Rom. 8.35.) He is our God for euer, and euer. Psal. 48.14. Q What should this loue of Christ teach vs? A. A mutuall desire after Christ, and delight in him saying: Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance, (Psal. 4.6.) and cause thy face to shine vpon vs, (Psalm. 67.1.) Set vs as a seale vpon thine heart, as a seale vpon thine arme, Cant. 8.6. Let him kisse mee with the kisses of his mouth; for thy loue is better than wine. Draw mee, wee will runne after thee, wee will be glad and reioyce in thee, wee will remember thy loue more than wine, (Cant. 1.2.4.) And our soule shall follow hard after thee: Psal. 63.8.132.3: Cant. 8.1. Psalm. 37.4. For all thy garments smell of mirrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of the yuory pallaces,
whereby they haue made thee glad, (Psal. 45.8.) while the king sitteth at his table, my spiknard sendeth foorth the smell there∣of A bunddle of mirrh is my welbeloued vnto mee, hee shall lie all night betwixt my breasts; my beloued is vnto mee, as a clu∣ster of Camphire in the vineyards of Enge∣die. (Cant. 1.12.) And as the aple tree, among the trees of the wood, so is my belo∣ued among the sonnes. (Cant. 2.3.) Thou art fairer than the children of men, grace is powred into thy lips. (Psal. 45.2.) Thy mouth is most sweete, yea thou art altogether louely. (Cant. 5.16.) Therefore my belo∣ued is mine and I am his, (Cant. 2.16.) I sate downe vnder his shadow with great delight, and his fruite was sweete to my taste. Hee brought mee to the banquetting house, and his banner ouer mee was loue. Stay me with flagons, comfort mee with aples, for I am sicke of loue: Cant. 2.3. Awake O North-winde, and come thou South, blow vpon my garden, that the spi∣ces thereof may flow out. Let my beloued come into his garden, and eate his pleasant
fruite: Cant. 4.16: Ioh. 3.29. 1 Cor. 16.22. 2 Thou must for him forsake thine own people, and thy fathers house, (Psal. 45.10.) Euen as Leuy, who said vnto his Father, and to his Mother, I haue not seene him, neither did hee acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children: Deu. 33.9: Mar. 10.29. Luk. 14.26.33:17.32. Heb. 10.34. Q. But where is Christ this our be∣loued to bee found? Can. 1, 7. A. Where two or three are gathered toge∣ther in his name, there is hee in the midst of them, (Math. 18.20.) Therefore if thou knowst not (O thou fairest among wo∣men) goe thy way foorth by the footesteps of the flocke, and feede thy kiddes besides the sheepheards tents: Cant. 1.8. Acts 10.6. CHAP. IX. Of Gods hearing Prayers. Q. WHat are the fruits of Gods Fa∣therly dispotion towards vs his people?
A. One is that thou shalt make thy prayer vnto him, and hee shall heare thee, (Iob 22.27.) In an acceptable time, and in the day of saluation, (Isa. 49.8.) Thou shalt call, and the Lord shall say, heere I am, (Psa. 58.9.) At the voyce of thy cry, when hee shall heare it, hee will answer thee, (Isa, 30.19.) Yea, it shall come to passe, that before you call hee will answer, and whiles you are yet speaking, he will heare: Isa. 65.24. Math. 18 19: Ierem. 29.12: Ioh. 4 10. Gen. 20.7. For in my distresse I called vpon the Lord, and cryed vnto my God, hee heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, euen into his eares, (Psal. 18.6.) And whiles Daniel was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel came vnto him, & said at the beginining of thy suppications, the cōmande∣ment came forth, and I am come to shew thee the vision, (Dan. 9.20.) And so the Lord answerd the Angel, praying for Ierusalem, with good words, and comfortable words: Zec. 1.13: Gen. 19.20, 21:20.17.24.12, &c. Exod. 2.23:8.12, &c. 12.30.9.33.

Ob. I am sure there is no day where∣in I doe misse prayer, and yet I am ne∣uer the neere. A. You aske, and receiue not, because you aske amisse, (Iames 4.3.) And your ini∣quities haue turned away these things, and your sinnes haue withheld good things: Ier. 5.25. Q. What is then required of a man that he may pray aright, and with assu∣rance of being heard? A. 1 Concerning the person: and first that he be in Christ; who because hee prayeth not for the world, but for those the Father hath giuen him, (Iohn 17:9.) If yee abide in him, aske what you will, and it shall be done vnto you: Ioh. 15.7. 2 That hee be righteous: the prayer
of the righteouus auaileth much, (Iames 5.16.) For the eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous, and his eares are open to their prayers, (1 Pet. 3.12. If ye regard wickednesse in your heart, the Lord will not heare you, (Psal. 66.18.) But if your heart condemne you not, then may you haue confidence towards God, and whatsoeuer you aske, you shall receiue of him, because you keepe his commandements, and doe those things that are pleasing in his sight, 1 Iohn 3.21. For the Lord is farre from the wicked, but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous, (Prou. 15.29.) The feare of the wicked it shall come vpon him, but the desire of the Righteous shall be granted, Pro. 10.24. Now because in many things wee sinne all, (Eccles. 7.20.) What praier, and supplication soeuer be made by any man, or by all the people Israel, which shall know euery man the plague of his owne heart, then will God heare in heauen, his dwel∣ling place. 1 Kings 8.38: Psalme 145.19: Ioh. 15.7:1.3.22. CONTRA. Iud. 10.

F what man is there of you, whom if his son aske bread, will he giue him a stone, or if aske a fish, will he giue him a serpent? If then being euill know how to giue good gif to your children, how much more sh your Father which is in heauen giue go things to them that aske him: Mat. 7.9. 3 The manner must be according t Gods will. For this is the confidence th wee haue in him, that if wee aske an thing according to his will, hee hearet vs: 1 Ioh. 5.14. Q. what is then the will of God con∣cerning the manner of prayer; that so praying wee may obtaine? A. 1 You must aske in faith, nothing wauerering, for hee that wauereth, is like  waue of the sea, driuen with the winde, an tossed; neyther let not that man thinke,
that he shall receiue any thing of the Lord, Iames 1.6.). But if thou doe commit thy ay vnto the Lord, and trust in him, then hall hee bring it to passe: Psal: 37.5. 2 In sinceritie. For the Lord is nigh ll them that call vpon him, to all that call pon him in truth: Psal. 145.18. 3 Prayer shall bee auaileable if it bee ruent, (Iames 5.16.) Open thy mouth ide, and hee will fill it, (Psal. 81.10) ry aloud, and hee shall heare thy voyce, Psal. 55.17.) And if with Iacob thou rastle with God, thou as a Prince shalt aue power with God and man, and halt preuaile Gen. 32.26: Hosea 12.4. Exod. 32.10: Luke 11.5. Heb. 5.7. 4 Pray continually, (1 Thes. 5.17) euen uery day, saying; Giue vs this day our aly bread, (Mat. 6.11.) and without cea∣ng, praying night and day, (2 Tim. 1.3.) ea, euening and morning, and at noone hen you pray, hee shall heare thy voyce Psalme 55.17. For Peter and Iames and Iohn with the est, continued with one accord in praier, and
supplication, (Acts 11.4.) And sudden there came a sound from heauen, as of a rus¦ing mighty winde, which filled all the hou where they were sitting. And there appe¦red vnto them clouen tongues like as of fir and it sate vpon each of them; and they we all filled with the holy Ghost; and began to speake with other tongues as the Spir gaue them vtterance: Act. 2.2.9.2.3. 5, We must submit our selues vnt Gods will for the successe; as di Christ, who praied, saying, O my Father if it be possible, let this cup passe from m neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou wil (Math. 26.39.) and was heard in that h feared: Hebr. 5.7. 6. With charity towards men▪ whe yee stand praying, forgiue; if you ha ought against any, that your Father al which is in heauen may forgiue you, (Mar 11.24.) For with what measure you me it shall be measured to you againe. Mat. 7. 7 Wee must doe all in the name  Christ: For through him wee both haue a accesse by one spirit vnto the Father, (Eph
2.18.) In whose name, whatsoeuer yee shall aske the Father, that will he doe, that the Father may bee glorified in the Sonne: Iohn 14.13. Ob. All these things I haue striuen for in prayer; but I am so cumbred with sinne, as may iustly moue the Lord to keepe good things from mee. A Elias was a man subiect to the like passion as we are, and hee prayed earnestly, that it might not raine, and it rained not: Iames 5.17. Ob. That might be but a chance. A. Hee prayed againe, and the heauens gaue raine, and the earth brought forth her increase: Iames 5.18. Ob. But what is that to mee? A. This was written for the generati∣ons to come, (Psal. 102.18.) And there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke; for the same Lord, ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him, (Rom. 10.12.) For which shall euery one that is godly pray vnto him, in a time when hee may b found: Psalm. 32.6: Iohn 17.20.
Q. What are the reasons of Gods hearing our prayers? A. 1 Because hee is your Father, and knoweth what things you haue need of before you aske him, Math. 6, 8: and 7.9. 2 The Angell of the couenant standing at the altar, hauing a golden censer, there was giuen vnto him much incense, that hee should offer it with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended vp before God, out of the Angels hand, Reuelat. 8.3. For yee are not come vnto the mount, that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor vnto blackenesse and darkenesse, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice, they that heard; intreated that the word should not be spoken vnto them any more: But yee are come to Iesus the mediator of the new couenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh bet∣ter things than that of Abel: Heb. 12.18. Which Iesus hath promised that if
we shall aske the Father any thing in his name, that he will pray vnto the Father for vs, (Iohn 16.26.) By whose prayers, our prayers also are sanctified: Mat. 23 19. Q. Seeing God hath thus promised to heare our prayers, what in the sence of our wants must wee doe? A. Hauing therefore boldnesse to en∣ter into the holy place, by the blood of Iesus, by a new and liuing way, which he hath con∣secrated for vs, through the vaile, that is to say his flesh; and hauing an high Priest, ouer the house of God, let vs draw neere, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, (Heb. 10.19.) And be carefull for nothing, but in euery thing by prayer, and supplicati∣on, with thankesgiuing, let your rqeuests be made vnto God: Phil. 4.6. Draw neere to God, and hee will draw neere to you, (Iames 4.8.) And come boldly to the throne of grace, that yee may obtaine mercy, to find grace, to helpe in time of need Heb. 4.16: Mat. 7.7: Luke 11.9: 1 Tim. 2.8: 1 Pet. 2.4. Col. 4.2: Iob 8.5: Ephes. 6.18. Isa. 65.16.
2 Saying vnto God, heare the voice of my supplication, when I crie vnto thee, when I lift vp my hand towards thy holy oracle, Psal. 28.2. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart, bee acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength, and my redeemer. Psal. 19.14. Numb. 10.36. 1 King. 8.26.28.52.57. 1 Chro. 4.10. Psal. 5.1.28.2.30.10.84.8.86.6.88.1.130.1.143.1. Isa. 37.17. Dan. 9.19. Mar. 14.36. Ob. But I wanting a gift of prayer, how can I expect that GOD should heare mee? A. Likewise also, the spirit will helpe your infirmities. For though wee know not how to pray, as wee ought, yet ihe spirit it selfe maketh intercession for vs, with gronings, which cannot be vttered. But he that search∣eth of the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the spirit; because he maketh intercession for the Saints, according to the will of God. Rom. 8.26. Q. When God hath heard our prai∣ers, what is then to be done?
A. Say, I loue the Lord, because he hath heard my voice, and my supplications; be∣cause hee hath inclined his eare vnto mee, therefore will I call vpon him as long as I liue, Psal. 116.1. I said in mine hast, I am cut off from be∣fore thine eyes; neuerthelesse, thou heardest the voyce of my supplication, when I cryed vnto thee, (Psal. 31.22.) In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soule, (Psal. 138.3.) Thou hast giuen me the desire of my heart, and hast not withdrawne from mee the re∣quest of my lips: Psal 21.2.10.17. Praise waiteth for thee in Sion, and vnto thee shall the vow be performed. O thou that hearest prayers, vnto thee shall all flesh come, (Psal. 65.1.) Blessed be God which hath not turned away our pray∣er, nor his mercy from vs, Psalm. 66.20: Ephes. 3.20. Psal. 66.16, 17. Deut. 4.7.
CHAP. X. God accepts his in their seruices. Q. WHat other fruite can you shew of Gods fatherly dis∣position towards vs his children? A. He shall also be pleased with the sa∣crifice of righteousnesse, (Psalm. 51.19.) For these are good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Sauiour, (1 Tim. 2.3.) And as an odor of a sweet smell: Phi. 4.18. For Noah built and altar, and the Lord smelt a sweet sauour, (Gen. 8.20.) More∣ouer, God had respect vnto Abel, and his offering, (Gen. 4.4.) And so shall the offe∣rings of Iudah and Ierusalem bee pleasant vnto the Lord, as in the daies of old, and as in former yeeres: Mal. 3.4: Iudges 13.23. Isa. 4.2. Ob. I can performe no work worthy of Gods acceptance. A. If there be first a willing minde, it
is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that hee hath not, (2 Cor. 8.12.) As well as the widdow with her two mites, more than the rich, casting in of their abundance: Luke 21.1. Marke 12.44. Ob. O my soule, thou hast said vnto the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodnesse ex∣tendeth not to thee; but to the Saints: Psalm. 16.2. A. I was hungry, and you gaue mee meate, I was thirsty, and you gaue me drinke: I was a stranger, and you tooke mee in; naked, and you clothed me: I was sicke, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came vnto me. For verily I say vnto you, in as much as you haue done it, vnto one of the least of these my brethren, you haue done it vnto me, (Mat. 25.35.) And whoso shall receiue but such a little child, receiueth me: Math. 18.5. Q. What may this teach vs? A. Therefore as liuing stones, being built vp a spirituall house, an holy priest∣hood, let vs offer vp spirituall sacrifice, ac∣ceptable
to God, by Iesus Christ. 1 Pet. 2.5. And to doe good, and to distribute, forget not; because with such sacrifices God is well pleased, (Heb. 13.16.) For hee that in these things serueth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approued of men: Rom. 14.18. Col. 3.17. 2 Cor. 9.7. Ob. If God doe accept vs in our wel∣doing, whence then this complaint? We haue fasted, and God seeth not; wee haue afflicted our soules, and hee taketh no knowledge: Isa. 58.3. A. If they did well, should they not be accepted? (Gen. 4.7.) When they fasted and mourned, did they at all fast vnto me? And when they did eate and drink, did they not eate for themselues, and drinke for themselues? Zech. 7.5. Behold, in the day of their fast, they find pleasure, and exact all their labours. Be∣hold, they fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickednesse, (Isa. 58.4.) Thus they haue brought an offering, and should I accept this at their hands, saith the Lord: Mal. 1.13.
For the plowing of the wicked is sinne, (Prou. 21.4.) And thereir sacrifice is abomination, how much more when they bring it with a wicked minde? Pro. 21.27. Ierem. 6.20, 14.12. Isa. 1.11.58.5. Amos 5.21.5.25. Isa. 66.3. Psalme 50.9. Hosea 6.6. 1 Cor 7.19. Psalm. 40.6. Marke 12.33. Iames 1.22. Luke 11.41. Ier. 7.22. Hos. 4.19. Hag. 2.11. Mal. 1.7.13. CHAP. XI. There is a reward for the righteous. Q. BVt suppose wee haue Gods ac∣ceptance; is this all wee shall haue for our well doing? A. Hee that soweth righteousnesse, shall also haue a sure reward: (Prou. 11.18.) And euery man shall receiue his owne re∣ward, according to his owne labour. 1 Cor. 3.8. Whether hee be bond or free: Ephes. 6.8. So that hee which followeth after righteous∣nesse
and mercy, findeth life, righteousnesse and honour, (Prou. 21.21.) For behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arme shall rule for him; Behold, his re∣ward is with him, and his worke before him, (Isa. 40.10.) So that a man shall say. verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that iudgeth the earth; Psalm. 58.11. Prou. 19.8.24.4.21.21. Iob. 34.7, &c. Therefore Vzziah so long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper, (2 Chro. 26.5.) Hezechiah also wrought that which was good and right and true before the Lord, and prospered, 2 Chro. 31.20:17.3. Numb. 25.11. Math. 26.13: Exod. 1.21. Zech. 3.7. Gen. 22.16. Ierem. 35.18: Heb. 11.5. Gen. 18.17.19.24.12. with 26.2 Chro. 14.7, &c. 2.13, 18: Psal. 18.20. Ob. Much good is done which God may neither see nor obserue. A. The Lord searcheth the heart, and tryeth the reines, euen to giue euery man ac∣cording to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his doings: (Ierem. 17.10.) For
hee is the great and mighty God, the Lord f host is his name, great in counsell, and mighty in worke; for his eyes are open, vpon all the wayes of the sons of men, to giue euery one according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his doings, (Ier. 32.18.) And doe runne to and fro, throughout the whole earth, to shew himselfe strong, in the behalfe of them whose heart is perfect towards him, 2 Chron. 16.9: Psal. 111.5. Ob. But may not God forget our weldoing? A. God is not vnrighteous to forget your worke and labour of loue, which yee haue shewed towards his name, in that you haue ministred to the Saints, and doe mini∣ster: Heb. 6.10. For he remembred his holy promise, and Abraham his seruant, (Psal. 105.42.) And when they that feared the Lord, and speake often one to another, the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought vpon his name Mal. 3.16.
I haue waited long and yet hau no reward. A. Yet bee not weary in weldoing, fo in due season you shall reape, if you faint not Gal. 6.9. For how euer the sonne of man be a one gone into a farre countrey, to recei vnto himselfe a kingdome; yet will he re∣turne, (Luke 19.11.) And come in the glo∣ry of his Father, with his Angels, and the hee shall reward euery man according to hi workes: Mat. 16.27. Therefore turne thou to thy God, keep mercy, and iudgement, and waite on thy Go continually: Hos. 12.6. Ob. As for works of mercy, wherein I doe part with my goods, the more good I doe for others, the lesse good remaines to my selfe. A. There is that scattereth, and yet in∣creaseth: The liberall soule shall be made fat, and he that watereth, shall be watered also himselfe: (Prou. 11.24.25.) Hee which soweth bountifully, shall reape bountifully, (2 Cor. 9.6.) Giue, and it shall be giuen vn∣to
you, good measure, pressed down shaken to∣gether, running ouer: Luke 6.38. For God is able to make all grace to a∣bound towards you, that you hauing suffici∣ency in all things, may abound in euery good worke. As it is writen, Hee hath dispersed abroad, he hath giuen to the poore, his righ∣teousnesse remaineth for euer: 2 Cor. 9.8. Psalm. 112.9. 1 Kings 17.16. Isa. 32.8. Psalme 41.1. Q. Why will God thus reward our weldoing in this kind? A Because the administration of this seruice, not onely supplieth the want of the Saints; but is abundant also by many thankesgiuing vnto God: whiles by the ex∣periment of this minsteration, they glorifie God, for your professed subiection vnto the Gospell of Christ, and for your liberall di∣stribution vnto them: 2 Cor. 9.12. Math. 5.16. Q. What is the vse of this? A. 1. To confute the scorner, for what man is he then, who drinketh vp scorning like water which goeth in compa∣ny
with the workers of iniquity, and w¦keth with wicked men? For hee saith profiteth a man nothing, that hee shou delight himselfe with God, (Iob 34.7. And what profit is it, that we haue kept h ordinances, and that we haue walked mour¦fully before the Lord of hosts, whic call the proude happie, and say, that suc as worke wickednesse, are set vp; yea, the that tempt God, are euen deliuered. Where as they that feare mee, shall be mine, sait the Lord of hosts, in that day when I ma vp my Iewels; and I will spare them, as man spareth his owne son that serueth him Then shall ye returne, and discerne between the righteous and the wicked; between him that serueth God, and him that ser∣ueth him not: Mal. 3.14. Thefore, hearken vnto mee yee men of vnderstanding; far be it from God that he should doe wickednesse, and from the Al∣mighty that hee should commit iniquity. For the worke of man shall be render vn∣to him, and cause euery man to finde accor∣ding to his waies: Iob 34.10, Mal. 2.17.
2 Pray, saying; Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my ood deedes, that I haue done for the house f my God, and for the offices thereof: (Neh. 13.14.) Doe thou O Lord recompence my workes, and giue vnto mee a full reward: (Ruth 2.12.) And let thy mercy be vpon me, according as I hope in thee: Psal. 33.22. 3 Be strong therefore, and let not your hands be weake; for your worke shall be re∣warded: (2 Chron. 15.7.) And as euery man hath receiued the gift, euen so minister he same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God: (1 Pet. 4.10.) Because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou puttest thine hand vnto: (Deut. 15.10.) And shall also re∣compence thee at the resurrection of the iust: Luke 14.14. Deut: 14.29. Gal. 6.10. Eccles 11.1. Hebrews 13.2. Colloss. 3.24. Prou. 3.28. 1 Tim. 6.17. Isa. 3.10. Q. Among other good works, shew mee how the works of charity must be
done, that so I neither neglecting th worke, nor faile in the manner of do¦ing them, may bee sure not to faile my reward? A. Take heed, that you doe not your alm before men to be seene of them; otherwi you haue no reward of your Father which in Heauen: But when thou doest thi almes, &c. let not thy left hand know wh thy right hand doeth, that thine alm may bee in secret, and thy Father whic seeth in secret, himselfe shall reward th openly: Math. 6.1.16. And whatsoeue you doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord, a not vnto men, knowing that of the Lord y shall receiue the reward of the inheritance for yee serue the Lord Christ. Col. 3.23. 2 Hee that receiueth a Prophet, in th name of a Prophet, shall receiue a Pr∣phes reward; and he that receiueth a righ¦teous man in the name of a righteous man shall receiue a righteous mans reward. An whosoeuer shall giue to drinke vnto one  these little ones a cup of cold water, onely i the name of a Disciple, verily, I say vnt
you, hee shall in no wise lose his reward: Math. 10.41. Ob. I see many in want, neither Pro∣phets, nor righteous men, but my e∣nemies, and no louers of goodnesse; what in this case must I doe? A. If thine enemy be hungry, giue him bread to eate; and if he be thirsty, giue him water to drinke: for thou shalt heape coles of fire vpon his head, and the Lord shall re∣ward thee, (Prou. 25.21) And cast thy bread vpon waters, for thou shalt finde it after many daies: Eccles. 11.1: Luke 6.27. Mat. 5.44. Psal. 35.13. 2 Sam. 1.11, 12 Acts 7.60. Q. What reward shall bee to such, as are fruitlesse in good workes? A. As hee that giueth to the poore shall not lacke, so hee that hideth his eyes shall haue many a curse: (Prou. 28.27.) And hee shall haue iudgement without mercy, that sheweth no mercy, Iames 2.13. And therefore say ye, wo be vnto the wic∣ked, it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be giuen him, (Isa. 3.11.)
For I say vnto you, that vnto euery one which hath, shall be giuen; and from him that hath not, euen that hee hath shall be taken away from him: Luke 19.26. Prou. 11.26, 27.21.13.11.31.17.5. Isa. 29.1. CHAP. XII. God will teach his in their waies. Q. WHat is the fourth priuiledge, God bestoweth vpon his chil∣dren? A. That hee will instruct and teach them in the way that they should goe, and will Guid them with his eye: (Psal. 32.8.) The meeke will he guide in iudgement, the meeke will hee teach his way; what man is hee that feareth the Lord, him shall hee teach in the way that hee shall choose? (Psal. 25.9.12.) And will be their guide euen vnto death: Psal. 48.14. Exo: 33.14 Gen. 46.4. Nehe. 9.20. Psalm. 37.23. Ioh. 10.3 4. Thus the Lord led his people foorth by
the right way, that they might goe to a City of habitation, (Psal. 107.7.) And he brought them to the border of his sanctuarie, which his right hand had purchased: Psalm. 78.54. Deut 1.31. Psalm. 78.52, 53. Exod. 13.21.22.40.38. Ob. Notwithstanding I am very sub∣iect to misse my way? A. Thine eares shall heare a word behind thee, saying, this is the way, walke yee in it, when yee turne to the right hand, and when yee turne to the left: (Isa. 30.21.) I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, I will lead them in the paths that they haue not knowne; I will mak darkenesse light before them, and crooked things straight: (Isa. 42.16.) For I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, shall not walke in darkenesse, but shall haue the light of life: Iohn 8.12.12.46. Q. Is this blessing common to all both good and bad? A. The righteousnesse of the perfect shall direct his wayes; but the wicked, shall fall by his owne wickednesse, (Prou. 11.5.) For
they waite for light; but loe it is darke∣nesse; for brightnesse, but they walke in darknesse; They grope for the wall, like the blinde, and grope as one without eyes; they stumble at the noone day, as in the twilight, they are in solitary places, as dead men: Isa. 59.9. Q. What may these things teach vs? A. 1 To pray, saying; shew mee thy way O Lord; teach mee thy paths, lead me in thy truth, and teach mee; for thou art the God of my saluation; on thee doe I waite all the day (Psal. 25.4.) Lead me O Lord in thy righteousnesse, because of mine ene∣mies, make thy waies streight before my face: (Psal. 5 8.) And if I haue found grace in thy sight, shew mee now thy way, that I may know thee. For wherein shall it be knowne heere, that I haue found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with mee? Exod. 33.13.16. Psal. 86.11.27.11.31.3. 2 To ponder the pathes of thy feete, that thy wayes may be ordered aright, Pro. 4.26. 3 In all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths: Prou. 3.6.
Q. When wee haue found God to be his words master in this, what is to bee done? A. Say, I will blesse the Lordw, ho hath giuen me counsell, my reines also teach mee in the night season, (Psal. 16.7.) He re∣storeth my soule, hee leadeth mee in the pathes of righteousnesse, for his names sake: (Psalm. 23.3.) For a mans goings being of the Lord, how can hee then vnderstand his owne waies; Pro. 20.24. CHAP. XIII. The guard of Angels. Ob. NOtwithstanding, which way so euer I goe, many dangers doe attend me. A. Therefore God hath added ano∣ther priuiledge; for the Angels, of the Lord, shall incampe round about thee, to keepe thee in all thy waies; they shall beare thee vp in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone: (Psal. 91.11.) For
are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to minister, for their sakes, which shall bee heyres of saluation? Hebr. 1.14. Exod. 32.3.34.2. Behold therefore the mountaines full of horses, and chariots of fire, round about Elisha, 2 Kings 6.17.1.19.5. Marke 1.13. Luke 22.43. Gen. 19.10. Acts 27.23.5.19.12.7.10.3. Q. What vse make you hereof? A. It admonisheth the wicked, to take heed they dispise not one of the least of Gods childrē: because that in heauen their Angels doe alwayes behold the face of their Father which is in heauen: Math. 18.10. CHAP. XIV. All things worke for good. Ob. IF God doe thus guide and guard his children, whence is it, that so many crosses do betide vs in our way? A. From God, by whose prouidence
wee know that all things worke together for Good, to them that loue God, to them that are called according to his purpose: Rom. 8.28. Q. Will other mens sinnes in see∣king my hurt doe mee good? A. Yea, for how euer they (as did the brethren of Ioseph) thinke euill against vs, yet God meaneth it vnto good, as then, to bring to passe, by sauing much peope aliue Gen. 50.20. Q. Their sinnes turned to the re∣liefe of their bodies; but will my owne sinnes, turne to the good of my soule? A. Yea, For Onessimus departed for a season, that he might be receiued for euer; not then as a seruant, but a brother, beloued both in the flesh, and in the Lord, Phile. 15. Moreouer, through the sharpe contention of Paul, and Barnabas, whereby they departing asunder one from the other, many were edified. Acts 15.37.
CHAP. XV. Comfort against death. Ob. IF these be the priuiledges of the Saints, whosoeuer then is ioyned to all the liuing, there is hope: (Eccles. 9.4.) But what man is hee that liueth, and shall not see death? shall hee deliuer his soule from the hand of the graue? (Psalm. 89.48.) Is not the graue the house appoyn∣ted for all the liuing? (Iob 30.23.) And will death also worke for our good? Iob 34.14. Eccles 3.18.11.8.9.10. 1 Kings 2.10. Acts 13.36. Iohn 8.52. Gen. 3.19. 2 Sam. 3.38. Iob 9.25.14.5. Psa. 90.10.103.15.144.4.39.12.39.4, 5. 1 Chron: 29.15. Isa. 40.6. Prou: 19.20. Numb: 23.10. Acts 22 9. A. Man indeed is not Lord ouer the Spirit, to retaine the Spirit, neither hath he
power in the day of death: (Eccles: 8.8.) Yet the day of death is better than the day of ones birth, (Eccles. 7.1.) For I heard a voyce from heauen, saying vnto mee, write; Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord, from hencefoorth, yea saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labours: (Reuel 14.13.) For the wicked haue there case from their tyranny, and there they that laboured valiantly are at rest: The prisoners rest to∣gether, and heare not the voce of the oppres∣sour, and the seruant is free from his master: (Iob 3.17.) Peace shall then come, they shall rest in their beds, euery one that wal∣keth before him. Isa. 57.2. 2 Though they die, yet their works die not; but doe follow thm: (Reuel. 14.13.) And when the wicked by death are driuen away in his wickednesse, yet the righ∣teous hath hope in his death: Prou. 14.32. Rom: 14.8. Prou: 11.7. Q. Why can these dead bones liue? Ezech. 37.3. A. Thy dead men shall liue together, with my dead body shall they arise: (Isa▪ 26 19.)
For since by man came death, by man came the resurrection of the dead: And as in Adam all dye, so in Christ shall all be made aliue. (1 Cor 15.21.) And therefore we haue hope towards God, that the resurrection shall be of the iust, and vniust: Acts 24.15. Ezech. 37.5. Psalm. 90.3. Q. There is no article of faith, doth more stagger mee than this of the re∣surrection; and therefore I pray helpe to confirme me in it. A. Meruaile not at this; for the houre is comming, in the which all that are in the graues shall heare his voyce, and shall come forth: Iohn 5.28. Now that the dead are raised vp, euen Moses sheweth at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaack, and the God of Iacob; for hee is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing; for all liue vnto him: Luke 20.37. Why then should it be thought an incre∣dible thing with you, that God should raise the dead? Acts 26.8. Q. Make the certainty of the re∣surrection
further to appeare, by some examples of such as haue beene raised vp from the dead. A. The sonne of the Shunamite be∣ing dead, was by the Prophet Elisha, restored vnto his mother aliue: 2 Kings 4.32. A dead man also being let downe in∣to the sepulcher of Elisha, hee reuiued, and stood vpon his feet. (2 Kings 13.21.) And when Christ with a loude voyce, said, vn∣to Lazarus arise and come forth; then he that was dead, came forth bound hand and foot, with the graue clothes: (Iohn 11.43.) Likewise at the death of Christ, the graues were opened, and many of the bodies of the Saints which slept, arose and came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy Citty, and appeared vnto many, (Math. 27.52.) Remember also that Iesus Christ, made of the seed of DAVID, was raised againe from the dead, according to my Gospell: 2 Tim. 2.8. Now if Christ be preached that hee rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection from the dead?
1 Cor. 15.12.1.15.4. Acts 10.40. Reue 1.18. Acts 13.30. Gal. 1.1. Acts 26.23. Q. What doth it concerne me, th Christ is raised from the dead? A. Very much; for Christ being r¦sen from the dead▪ is become the first fruite of them that sleepe, (1 Cor. 15.20.) A this is a faithfull saying, that if we be de with him, we shall also liue with him, 2 Tim 2.11. For God that hath raised vp th Lord, will raise vp vs by his owne powe (1 Cor. 6.14.) who by him doe beleeue i God, that raised him vp from the dead, an gaue him glory that your faith and hop might be in God: 1 Pet. 1.2. 2 Corin.  14. Rom. 8.11. Ob. But death is called the King  terrours: (Iob. 18.14.) who then ca ouercome it? A. I am (saith Christ) the resurrectio and the life, he that beleeueth in me, thoug hee were dead, yet shall hee liue, (Iohn 11 25.) I will ransome them from the powe of the graue, I will redeeme them from deat O death, I will be thy plague! O graue,
will be thy destruction,! The sting of death sinne, and the strength of sin is the Law; t thankes be to God, which hath giuen s victory through our Lord Iesus Christ, Cor. 15.55 Psal. 68.20. Hosea 13.14. Ob. I may be drowned in the sea, and euoured of fishes. A. The sea shall giue vp the dead which ein it, and death and hell, shall deliuer p the dead which were in them, Reuel. 20.3. Ob. Though I should be buried in he earth, yet amidst so many bodies, onsumed to dust, and so confusedly ixed, my body may be lost. A. This is the Fathers will which hath ent mee, that of all which he hath giuen me, should loose nothing, but should raise it vp gaine at the last day: Ioh. 6.39. Ob. The same bodies for number hat dyed, may bee raised from the dead; but not the same in identitie of bodies. A. I know my Redeemer liueth, and that hee shall stand the latter day vpon the
earth, and though after my skinne, wor destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall see God; whom I shall see for my selfe, a mine eyes shall behold, and not anothe though my reines be consumed within m Iob 19.25. Iohn 11.24. Q. How are the dead raised vp? and wi what bodies doe they come? 1 Cor. 15.35. A. Thou foole, that which thou sowest not quickned except it dye, and that whi thou sowest, thou sowest not that body th shall be, but bare graine, it maybe cha wheate, or some other grain. But God giue it a body, as it pleaseth him, and to euery se his own body, &c. So also is the resurrecti from the dead. It is sowne in corruption, is raised in incorruption; It is sowne in di¦honor, it is raised in glory; it is sowne weaknesse, tt is raised in power: it sowne naturall body, it is raised a spirituall bod 1 Corin. 15.36. Q. You say that all shall be ray¦sed; wherein then will stand the dif¦ference betweene the Elect, and repro∣bate at that day?
A. As with Pharaohes chiefe butler, and chiefe baker, whose heads were both lifted vp; but the one vnto his butlership, the other vnto the gallowes, to be hanged vp, (Gen. 40.20.) So all both good and bad, shall come forth. They that haue done good, vnto the resurrection of life, and they that haue done euill, vnto the resurrection of damnation: Ioh. 5.29. Dan. 12.2.13. Q. What shall become of them, who shall be found aliue at the generall re∣surrection? A. Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleepe, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpe; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed: 1 Cor. 15.51. Q. Now I know that wee shall rise a∣gain in the resurrection, at the last day: Ioh. 11.24. What therefore would you thence inferre? A. 1 Concerning them that sleepe, that ye sorrow not, euen as others without hope. For if we beleeue that Iesus died and rose againe,
euen so them also, which sleepe in Iesus, w God bring with him, 1 Thes. 4.13. 2 Though I walke in the valley, of t shaddow of death, I will feare no euill; fo thou art with mee, thy od, and thy sta comfort mee: (Psalm 23.4.) Therefo also my heart is glad, my glory reioycet my flesh also shall rest in hope: for thou wi not leaue my soule in hell. Psal. 16.9. 3. Let vs therefore which haue the fir fruites of the spirit groane within our selue waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redem¦tion of our bodies: Rom. 8.23. 4 Let none of vs liue or die to our selue for whether wee liue, wee liue vnto th Lord, or whether we dye, we dye vnto th L, For to this purpose, Christ dye  and reuiued, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and liuing, (Rom 14.7.) Wherefore labour we, that whether present, or ahsent wee may be accepted o him: 2 Cor. 5.9. Q. When this dust returneth to th earth, (Eccle. 12.7.) who knoweth the spiri of a man that goeth vpward, and the spirit o
the beast that goeth downeward to the earth: Eccles. 3.21. A. Wee know that if this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolued, wee haue a building of God, an house not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens, (2 Cor. 5.1.) For the spirit shall returne to God, that gaue it, (Eccles. 12.7.) and shall bee with Christ in Paradise, (Luke 23.43.) And with Lazarus in Abrahams bosome: Luke 16.22. Q. How stand you affected with this? A. I am in a straite betwixt two, hauing a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better, (Pbil. 1.23.) For in this wee groane earnestly, desiring to be clothed vpon with our house, which is from heauen; if so be that being clothed, wee shall not be found naked. For we that are in this taber∣nacle, doe groane, being burdened; not for that we would be vnclothed, but clothed vp∣on, that mortality might be swallowed vp of life (2 Cor. 5.2.) Therefore wee are alwaies confident; knowing that whilest wee are at home in the body, wee are absent from the
Lord, (for wee walke by faith, and not by sight) wee are confident I say, and willing, rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord, 2 Corin. 5.6. Math. 17.4. CHAP. XVI. Of the last iudgement. Ob. WHat we shall haue after death I cannot say, but in these daies of my vanity I haue seen; there is a iust man that perisheth in his righteousnesse, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickednesse: (Ecces. 7.15.) yea, the tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that prouoke God are secure; for into their hand God bringeth abundantly, (Iob 12.6.) Be∣hold, these are the vngodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches, verily I haue cleansed my heart in vaine, and washed my hands in innocency: For all the day long I haue been plagued and chastened euery
morning: Psal. 73.12, 13. Ier. 5.27.12. 1. Eccl. 8.14. A. God hath appointed a day, in which he will iudge the world, in righteousnesse, by that man whom hee hath ordained; whereof he hath giuen assurance vnto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. (Acts 17.31.) So that, we shall all stand before the Iudgement seat of Christ. (Rom. 14.10.) Who shall iudge his people. (Heb. 10.30.) Vnto whom they also must come to giue an account. 1. Pet. 4.5. Heb. 9.27. Psal. 96.13.98.9. Eccles. 11.9. Ob. Where is the promise of his com∣ming? For since the Fathers fell a sleepe, all things continue, as they were from the beginning? 2, Pet. 3.4. A. This you are willingly ignorant of, that by the Word of GOD, the Heauens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water, and in the water, whereby the world that then was, being ouerflowed with water perished. But the Heauens, and the earth which are now, by the same word,
are kept in store, reserued vnto fire agains the day of Iudgement, and perdition of vn¦godly men. But beloued, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as  thousand yeares, and a thousand yeares a one day. The Lord is not slacke concer∣ning his promise (as some men cou slacknesse) but is long suffering, to vs ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. 2. Pet. 3.5. Q. Tell vs then when these thing shall be, and what shall be the signes, o the end of the World. Mat. 24.3. A. 1 Before the end come, many shall come in CHRISTS name, saying, I am CHRIST, and many false Prophets shall arise. Mat. 24.5.11. 2 The day shall not come, except there come a falling away first (2. Thes. 2.3.) and many be deceiued. Mat. 24.5.11. 3 That man of sinne shall first be re∣uealed; the sonne of perdition, who oppo∣seth, and exalteth himselfe, aboue all that
is called GOD, or that is worshipped. 2. Thes. 2.3.4. 4 You shall heare of warres, and rumors of warres: for Nation shall rise against Nation, & Kingdome against Kingdome, but the end shall not be yet. (Mat. 24.6.7.) 5 Because iniquity shall be increased, the loue of many shall waxe cold, Mat. 24.12. 6 This Gospell of the Kingdome shall be preached in all the world for a witnesse vnto all Nations, and then shall the end come. Mat. 24.14. 7 When the fulnesse of the Gentiles is come in, all Israell shall be saued; as it is written. The deliuerer shall come out of Sion, and shall turne away vngodlinesse from Iacob, Rom. 11.25. 8 As it was in the dayes of Noah, so shall it be also in the dayes of the Sonne of Man; they did eate, they dranke, they married wiues, they were given in marriage, vntill the day that Noah went into the Arke, and the Flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as
it was in the dayes of Lot; they did eate, they dranke, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodome, it rained fire, and brimstone from heauen, and de∣stroyed them all; euen thus shall it bee in the day, when the Sonne of man is reuealed. (Luke 17.26.) And when they shall say peace, and safety, then sudden destruction commeth vpon them; as trauell vpon a wo∣man with child, (1. Thes. 5.3.) Or as a thiefe by night, 2. Pet. 3.10. Reuel. 16.15. Math. 24.38. Now learne a parable of the Fig tree, when his branch is yet tender, and putteth foorth leaues, ye know that summer is nigh. (Math. 24.32.) And when ye see a cloud rise out of the West, straite way yee say a shower commeth, and so it is. And when ye see the South wind blow, yee say, that it will bee hot, and it commeth to passe. (Luke 12.54.) So likewise yee, when yee shall see all these things, know that it is neere, euen at the doore. (Math. 24.33.)
But of the day and houre, knoweth no man, no not the Angels of heauen, but my Fa∣ther onely, Math. 24.36. Eccles. 8.5.7. Act. 1.7. Q. What shall bee the manner of CHRISTS comming to judgement? A. Hee shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall ga∣ther together, his elect from the foure winds, from one end of heauen, to the o∣ther. (Math. 24.31) Then the Heauens shall passe away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt away with fervent heat: the earth also, with the workes that are therein shall be burned vp, (2. Pet. 3.10.) And there shall bee a great earth∣quake; the sonne shall become blacke, as sackcloth, with haire, and the Moone become as blood, and the Starres of Heauen shall full to the earth, and the heauens shall depart as a scrule. Reuel 6.12. And there shall be signes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Starres, and the Sea, and the waues roaring: the
powers of the Heauen shall be shaken, and then shall they see the signe of the sonne of Man comming in the Cloudes with power, and great glory. (Luk. 21.25.) Who shall be reuealed from heauen in flaming fire, (2. Thes. 1.7.) With ten thousands of his Saints, in glory, and all his holy Angels with him. (Mat. 25.31.) Thou∣sands thousands, shall minister vnto him; and ten thousand times, ten thousands shall stand before him: and the Iudge∣ment Seat shal be set, and the bookes ope∣ned. (Dan. 7.9.) And euery eye shall see him Reu. 1.7. Q. How shall men, in the snce o these things, stand affected? A. Vpon the earth there shall be distresse of Nations, with perplexity: mens hearts shall faile them for feare, and for loo∣king after those things which shall then come on the earth. (Luk. 21.26.) And al the kindreds of the Earth shall waile be∣cause of him. Reuel. 1.7. And in those dayes shall men seeke Death, and shall not find it; and shall de∣sire
to dye, and death shall flye from them. (Reu. 9.6.) Then the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and euery bondman, and euery free man, shall hide themselues in the Dennes, and in the Rockes of the Mountaines, & shall say to the Mountaines, and Rockes, fall on vs, and hide vs from the face of him that sitteth vpon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand? Reuel. 6.15. Isa. 2.19.13.7.33.14. Hos. 10.8. Q. But shall the godly bee thus per∣plexed at the beholding of these things? A. Beloued if our heart condemne vs not, then shall we haue confidence towards God. (1. Ioh. 3.21.) For God hath not gi∣uen vs the spirit of feare, but of Po∣wer, of Loue, and of a sound Mind. (2, Tim. 1.7.) And therefore, when these things begin to come to passe, then shall we looke vp, and lift vp our heads, be∣cause our Redemption draweth nigh. (Luk. 21.28.) For CHRIST was once of∣fered to beare the sinnes of many; and vnto
them that looke for him, shall he appeare the second time without sinne vnto saluati∣on, (Heb. 9.28.) And herein is our loue made perfect, that wee may haue bold∣nesse at the day of Iudgment, because as he is, so are we in the World: Ioh. 1.4.17, 18. Rom. 10.11. Q. When Christ is set downe vpon his throne of glory, what is the first work he shall doe? A. He shall seperate the sheepe from the Goats; and he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, and the goats on his left, (Mat. 25, 32.) Among whom, there shall be two in one bed; one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shal be grinding to∣gether; the one shall be taken and the other left. Two men shall be in the field, the one shal be taken, and the other left. Luk. 17 34. Q. What shall follow vpon this sepe∣ration? A. Such as haue followed CHRIST in the Regeneration, when the Sonne of Man shall sit in the Throne of his glory; they al∣so shall sit vpon twelue thrones; iudging the
twelue tribes of Israel, (Mat. 19.28.) Know yee not also that the Saints shall iudge the Angels? 1. Cor. 6.3. Q. What are the things wherof Iudg∣ment shall be giuen? A. GOD shall bring euery worke into Iudgment with euery secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be euill, (Eccl. 12.14.) Moreouer I say vnto you, that for e∣uery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue an account thereof in the day of Iudgement. For by their words they shall be iustified, and by theyr words they shall be condemned. Matth. 12, 36. Ioh. 3.18. Iude, v. 15. Q. What is the euidence which shall be produced? A. Hee shall not iudge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprooue by the hearing of his eares, (Isa. 11.3.) but by the Bookes which shall bee then opened, (Reuel. 20.12.) their Con∣sciences also bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one another or excusing. Rom. 2.15.
Q. What are the rules according t which CHRIST shall iudge. A. 1. As many as haue sinned with out law, shall perish without law and  many as haue sinned in the law, shall be iudged by the law. Rom. 2.12. 2. GOD shall iudge the secrets of men by IESVS CHRIST, according to m gospell (Rom. 2.16.) The words also whic CHRIST hath spoken, shall iudge them i the latter day. Ioh. 12.48. Iam. 2.12. Q. What is the sentence it self which CHRIST shall pronounce? A. Hee shall say vnto them on his righ hand, come yee blessed of my Father, inhe∣rit the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foundation of the word. Then sha he say vnto them on his left hand, Depar from me yee Cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devill, and his Angels (Math. 25.34.) And vnto his servants h shall say, binde them hand and foot, (Mat. 22.13.) and cast you these vnprofitable servants into outer darknesse. Math. 25.30.
Q. What shall bee the issue of this sentence? A. God will then render to every one ac∣cording to his deeds. To them who by pati∣ent, continuance in well doing, seeke glory, and honor, and immortality; eternall life. But vnto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth; but obey vnrighteous∣nesse; indignation, and wrath tribulation, and anguish vpon euery soule of man, that doeth evil, to the Iew first, and also to the Gentile. But glory, and honour, and peace to euery man that worketh good, to the Iew first, and also to the Gentile. Rom. 2.7. 2. Cor. 5.10. Mat. 25.46. Q. What may the consideration of these things teach vs? A. 1. Reioyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but know thou that for all these things GOD will bring thee into iudgement Eccles. 11.9. 2. Seeing then that all these things shall
be dissolued, what manner of persons ough yee to be in all holy conuersation, and godl¦nes? Looking for and hasting, vnto the com∣ming of the day of the Lord. And seein yee looke for such things, be diligent, th ye may be found of him in peace, witho spot, and blamelesse. 2. Pet. 3.11, 12, 14. And seeing the day of the LORD shall come as a Thiefe in the night (1. Thes. 5.2.) Blessed are those Seruants whom the Lord when he commeth shall fir watching, (Luk. 12.37.) Watch ye there∣fore, and pray alwayes, that yee may bee counted worthy to escape all things, whic shall come to passe, and to stand before th Son of man. Luk. 21.36. 1. Thes. 5.4 Reu. 3, 11.16.15.

YOu haue said that after the day of Iudgment, GOD will giue Eternall life vnto his children: But is here any certaintie thereof? A. This is the promise that he hath romised vnto vs, euen Eternall life; and his life is in his Sonne: (Ioh. 1.2.25.1.5.11.) Vnto whom he hath giuen power o∣uer all flesh, that he should giue Eternall life, to as many as GOD his Father hath given him: (Ioh. 17.2.) That who∣soeuer liueth, and beleeueth in him should neuer die, (Iob. 11.26.) For this corruptible, shall put on incorruption, and this mortall shall put on immortalitie. (1. Cor. 15.53.) That as sinne had aigned vnto death, euen so might Grace aigne, through Righteousnesse, vnto E∣ernall Life, by IESVS CHRIST

Wee shall then be as the Angels GOD. (Mat. 22.30.) And be made co¦formable to the Image of his Sonne. (Ro 8.29.) When he shall first haue change our vile bodies, and made them like vn his glorious body. (Phil. 3.21.) For as the earthly, such are they that are earthly and as is the heauenly, such are they th are heauenly. And as wee haue borne t image of the earthly, we shall also beare the image of the heauenly: (1. Cor. 15 48. Hauing bodies shining as the brigh¦nesse of the Firmament, and as the starre (Dan. 12.3.) Yea as the Sunne for ev and ever. Matth. 13.43. Exod. 3 30.35. Q What manner of dwelling sha we then haue?
A. Full glorious things are spoken of this Citie of GOD. (Psal. 87.3.) For it is such a City, as Abraham looked for, whose builder and maker is GOD. (Heb. 11.10.) The same is a great Citie, hauing the glory of GOD: whose light is like vnto a stone most precious: euen like a Iasper stone, cleere as Christall. It hath a wall great, and high, with twelue Gates, and at the Gates twelue Angels. And the wall of the Citie hath twelue foundations, and the Citie lyeth foure square; and the length is as large as the breadth, twelue thousand furlongs: and the length, and the bredth, and the height of it are equall. And the building of the wall it is Iasper, and the Citie pure gold, like vnto cleere glasse; and the foundations of the wall of the Ci∣tie, are garnished with all manner of precious stones. Reuel. 21.10. &c. Q. What good company shall wee there haue? A. 1 All the faithfull: for wee shall sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob in the Kingdome of Heauen. Maht. 8.11. Luk. 13.28.

Who shall be as Moses, vnto whom th Lord spake face, to face, as a man speaket to his friend: (Exod. 33.11. (Matth▪ 5.8. Q. But is this house large enough to hold so much company? A. In my Fathers house are many man∣sions; if it were not so, I would haue tol you. I goe to prepare a place for you. Ioh▪ 14.2.
Q. Shall we then, and there be sub∣iect to any more miserie? A. The voyce of weeping shall be heard no more there, nor the voyce of crying. (Isa. 65▪ 19.) For God shall wipe all teares from your eyes, (Reu. 21.4.) You shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more, neither shall the sonne light on you nor any heate. (Reuel. 7.16.) For there is the tree of life, the leaues whereof, are for the healing of the nations, and there shall be no more curse. Reu. 22.2. Isa. 54, 4. Reuel. 7.17, 14.13. Heb. 4, 6. Q. Shall we then haue the benefit of all our earthly comforts, and delights, we now inioy? A. In the resurrection they neither mar∣rie, nor are giuen in marriage, Math. 22.30. Moreouer there is no temple there, (Reu. 21.22.) they need no candle, neither light of the Sunne. (Reuel. 22.25.) The Sunne shall be no more, a light by day, neither for brightnesse, shall the Moone giue light vnto them. Isa. 60.19.
Q. What then shall our prouisio bee? A. Since the beginning of the world men haue not heard, nor perceiued by th eare, neither hath the eye seene what GOD hath prepared for them that waiteth fo him. (Isa. 64.4.) For the Lord GOD Almighty and the Lambe are the Templ in it, (Ru. 21.22.) Who also shall giu them light, (Ru. 22.5.) and shall bee their glory, (Isa. 60.19.) And the shall be abundantly satisfied with the fat∣nesse of his house, and shall bee made t drinke of the Riuers of his pleasures. (Psal 36.8.)

Wherein GOD willing more aboundantly, to shew vnto the heires of Promise, the immutability of his Coun∣sell, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was not possible that GOD should lye, we might haue strong consolaton; who haue fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set be∣fore vs; whch hope we haue, as anker of the soule, both sure and stedfast, and which entreth into that, which is within the vaile, whether the fore-runner is for vs entred. Heb. 6.17. Q. Shew me then some marks wher∣by I may discerne whether or no, my selfe am one of that number wch shalbe saued? A. 1. This is life Eternall, that wee know him to be the onely true God, and IE∣SVS CHRIST whom he hath sent. Ioh. 17.3. 2. GOD so loued the world, that hee gaue his onely begotten Son, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish but haue euerlasting life, (Io. 3.16.) These things I write vnto you that beleeue in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye
haue eternall life. 1. Ioh. 5.13. Ioh. 5.24.3.36. Acts 16.31. 3. It shall be, that whosoeuer shal call on the name of the Lord, shall be saued, Act. 2 21. 4. We know that we are passed from death, to life, because we loue the brethrē. 1. Io. 3.14 5. Whosoeuer shall humble himselfe, and become as a little child, the same is great in the Kingdome of GOD. Mat. 18.4. Mat, 5.3.19.14. 6 The Kingdome of Heauen suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. (Mat. 11.12.) and for ioy thereof, depart, and sell all that they haue to purchase it, Mat. 13.44, 5.10. 7. There shall in no wise enter into it, any thing that defileth, nor whosoever worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie. (Reu. 21.27.) For without are dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Mur∣therers, & Idolaters, (Reu. 22.15) Neither shall any that worketh abhomination enter into the Kingdome of GOD. Reu. 21.27. The sinners in Zion are afraid, feare∣fulnesse shall surprise the Hypocrites:
Who among vs shall dwell with the devou∣ring fire; who among vs, shall dwell with the everlasting burnings? He that wal∣keth righteously, and speaketh vprightly, he that despiseth the gaine of the oppres∣sions, that shaketh his hands from hol∣ding of bribes, and stoppeth his eare from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing of euill: hee shall dwell on high: (Isa. 33.14.) And to him that ordereth his conuersation aright, will I shew the salvation of GOD. Psal. 5.23.15.1.119.155. Math. 5.19. Ier. 17.13. Ob. These things in some measure I doe find to be in my selfe, yet my griefe is, that I can be no more sencible of this happinesse? A. 1. Now wee see through a glasse darkly; but then face, to face; Now wee know in part, But then shall wee know, even as also wee are knowne. 1. Cor. 13.12. 2. We are saved by hope, but hope that is seene, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth hee hope for it? But
if we hope for that we see not, then doe we with patience waite for it, (Rom. 8.24.) As well as IACOB, who said, I haue waited for thy salvation O LORD. Gen. 49.18. 1. Pet. 1.9. 3. Faith is the substance of things ho∣ped for, and the evidence of things not seene, (Heb. 11.1) Whom hauing not seene, you loue: in whom though you see him not, yet beleeuing, you reioyce with ioy vnspeakable, and full of glory recei∣uing the end of your faith, the saluation of your soules. 1. Pet. 1.8. 4. For this end, pray, saying, Restore vnto mee the ioy of thy salvation, and vphold me with thy free spirit, (Psal. 51.12.) And then with ioy shall you draw wa∣ter out of the wels of saluation. Isa. 12.3. Ob. I am beset with so many ene∣mies, that my feare is, I shall fall short of Heauen? A. We are kept by the power of GOD through faith vnto saluation ready to bere∣uealed in the last times. (1. Pet. 1.5.) When Christ shall put downe all rule, and all au∣thority,
and power. For he must reigne till he haue put all his enemies vnder his feet: the last whereof that shall be destroyed is death. For hee hath put all things vnder his feet; but when hee saith, all things are put vnder him, it is manifest, that he is excepted, which did put all things vnder him. 1. Cor. 15.24. Q. Seeing GOD hah prouided for vs such an inheritance, what therefore are we to doe? A. 1. We are bound to giue thankes al∣wayes to GOD, because GOD hath from the beginning chosen vs to saluation, through sanctification of the spirit, and the beliefe of the truth. Whereunto hee called vs by the Gospell, to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord IESVS CHRIST, 2. Thes, 2.13. 1. Pet. 1.3.4. 2 Because the Scriptures are calld the Word of the Kingdome (Mat. 13.19.) Search the Scrptures, for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life: Ioh. 5.39. In which, because some things are hard to be vnderstood, (2. Pet. 3.16.) Let euery
man be swift to heare, (Iam. 1.19.) For af∣ter that in the Wisedome of GOD, the World by Wisedome knew not GOD, it plea∣sed GOD by the foolishnes of Preaching, to saue them that beleeue, 1. Cor. 1.21. 3. Seeing wee here haue no continuing City, but we seeke one to come, (Heb. 13.14.) And the time here being short, it remaineth that both they that haue Wiues, be as though they had none, and they that weepe, as though they wept not; and they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not, and they that vse this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this World passeth away: (1. Cor. 7.29.) And wee according to his Promise, looke for new Heauens, and a new earth, where dwelleth Righteousnesse. 2. Pet. 3.13. Ioh. 6.27. 4. Make you friends of the Mammon of vnrighteousnesse, that when yee faile, they may receiue you into ever∣lasting habitations. Luk. 16.9. Sell that yee haue and giue Almes,
and prouide your selues Bags, which waxe not old, and treasures in Heaven that faile not. Luk. 12.33. Matth. 6.19. 5. Hauing therefore these promises, let vs cleanse our selues, from all filthines, of flesh, and spirit, perfecting holinesse in the feare of GOD, 2. Cor. 7.1. And let vs feare left a promise, being left vs, of entring into his rest, any of you should seeme to come short of it, (Heb. 4.1.) Wherein we ought to giue the more earnest heed to the things which wee haue heard, least at any time wee should let them slip. For if the Word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every trans∣gression, and disobedience, receiued a iust recompence of reward; how shall wee escape if wee neglect so great sal∣vation which at the first began to be spo∣ken by the LORD, and was confir∣med to vs, by them that heard him. Heb. 2.1. Wherefore the rather brethren, giue diligence to make your calling, and
election sure: for if yee doe these things yee shall never fall For so an entrance shall be ministred to you abundantly into the everlast ng Kingdome, of our Lord and Saviour IESVS CHRIST, 2. Pet. 1.10, 11. Ru. 22.14. Heb. 12, 28. 1. Cor 15 34 Rm. 13.11. 1. Cor. 6.9. Tit. 2.11. Q You tell me of Heaven, and if these bee the condtions of attaining it, how shall I e animated to come there? A. If any man will come after me, let him deny himselfe, and take vp his crosse, and follow me. For whosoever shall saue his life, shall loose it; and whosever will loose his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited, if hee gaine the whole world, and loose his owne soule? And what shall a man giue in exchange for his soule? Math. 16.24. Know yee not that they which runne in a race, runne all, yet one receiveth the prize. So runne that you may obtaine. And every one that proveth masterie▪ ab∣staineth from all things; and they doe it to obtaine a corruptible Crowne; but wee
for an incorruptible 1. Cor. 9.24. Therefore indure hardnesse, as a good souldier of IESVS CHRIST. No man that warreth intangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen hm to be a souldier. And if a man also striue for a masterie, yet is he not crowned, except he striue lawfully. The husbandman that la∣boureth, must first be partakers of the fruits. Consider what I say, and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things. 2. Tim. 2.3. Math. 10.37. Q. When wee haue done what we can, will our well-doing merit Heaven? A. Not by workes of righteousnesse which we haue done, but according to his mercy he saveth vs, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost which hee shed on vs abundantly, through IESVS CHRIST our Saviour; that being iustified by his Grace, wee should be made heyres, according to the hope of Eternall life. Tit. 3.5. Ephes. 2.8.
CHAP. XVIII. Of eternall Death. Q. YOu haue well satisfied me con∣cerning the happinesse of the Saints, after the day of Iudgment; shew me also more fully, what shall then bee the punishment of the wicked? A. They shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the King∣dome of GOD, and themselues thrust out. Luk. 13.28. 2. They shall be delivered to the tor∣mentors, (Math. 18, 34.) who shall bind them hand and foot, (Math. 22, 13.) and cast them into a furnace of fire (Mat. 13.42.) which is vnquenchable, (Math. 3.12.) The place is deepe and large; the pile thereof is fire, and much wood; the breath of the Lord of hosts, like a streame of brim∣stone, doth kindle it, (Isa. 30, 33.) There they shall be scorched with great heat; so as they shall blaspheame the name of God,
which hath power over these plagues. There shall be great darknesse, and they shall gnaw their tongues for paine, (Reuel. 16.9, 10.) For they shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of GOD, which is powred out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation, and they shall bee tormented with fire, and brimstone, in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lambe. And the smoake of their torment, ascendeth vp for ever, and e∣uer: and they shall haue no rest, day, nor right, (Reu. 14.10.) For their worme shall not dye, neither shall their fire be quenched. (Isa. 66.24.) Even as Sodome and Gomorrha, and the Cities about them, in like manner, giving them∣selues over to Fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set foorth for an example, of suffering the vengeance, of Eternall fire, Iud. v. 7. Iob. 21, 30. Math. 13, 42. Psal. 119.155.9, 17. Ier. 17, 13. Math. 8, 12. Ob. This is but a meere scar-crow, and
therefore wee will goe on and prosper. A. O serpents, the generation of vi∣pers how can yee escape the damnation of Hell. (Math. 23.33.) For doe you commit such things, and doe you thinke to escape the Iudgement of GOD? (Rom. 2.3.) Haue yee not asked them that goe by the way? And doe yee not know their to∣kens? That the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction: they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. Iob 21.29. Ob. It may be the base rabble cannot escape Hell; but my greatnesse will beare me out well enough. A. Riches profit not in the day of wrath, (Prou. 11.4.) For Dives though rich went to Hell, when as Lazarus though poore was caried into Heaven▪ Luk. 16.23. Moreouer, Tophet is ordained of old, for the King it is prepared, (Isa. 30 33.) Therefore Hell hath inlarged it selfe, and hath opened his mouth without measure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pompe, and he that reioyceth among them, shall descend into it, (Isa. 5.14.)
For God accepteth not the person of Prin∣ces, nor regardeth the rich more than the poore; for they are all the worke of his hands. Iob, 34, 19. Luk. 10.15. Ob. These terours may concerne Turkes, and Papists, and Pagans; but for such as liue in the bosome of the Church they shall neuer, as I hope, be touched with them. A. Euen in the Church also there are many called, but few chosen. (Math. 20, 16.) As in a great house, there are vessels not onely of gold, and of silver, but also of wood, and of earth; and some to honour, and some to d shonour, (2. Tim. 2, 20.) And the children of the Kingdome, shall be cast out, into outer darknesse, (Math. 8.12.) For the Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdome, all things that offend, and them that doe iniquitie. (Math. 13 41.) These are the tares which shall be bound in bundles, to e burnt. Math. 13, 30.13, 47.3.7, 8.10, 1. Ob. Lord haue we not eaten, and drun∣ken
in thy presence, and hast thou not taught in our streets? (Luk. 13 26.) And haue not most of thy mighty workes beene done amongst vs? Math. 11.20. A. Woe vnto thee Corazin, woe vnto thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty workes, which were done in you, had beene done in Tire and Sidon they would haue repented long agoe in sack-cloathand ashes. But I say vnto you, it shall be more tollerable, for Tire and Sidon at the day of Iudge∣ment, then for you. And thou Caperna∣um, which art exalted vnto Heaven, shalt bee brought downe to Hell: for if the mighty workes which haue beene done in thee, had beene done in Sodome, it would haue remained vntill this day. But I say vnto you, that it shall be more tollerable, for the Land of Sodome, in the day of Iudgement, than for thee. Math. 11.21. Ob. But Lord haue wee not Prophesied in thy Name, and in thy name cast out De∣vils? Math. 7.22. A. I professe vnto you, I neuer knew you, depart from me yee workers of iniquitie. Math. 7.23.
Q. What then may the condemnation of Hell teach vs? A. Therefore dearely beloued, avenge not your selues, but giue place vnto wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay it, saith the LORD, Rom. 12, 19, Math. 7, 1. Eccl. 3, 17. 2 Knowing the terror of the Lord, we perswade men, (2. Cor. 5, 11,) to mortifie their members which are vpon the earth: fornication vncleannesse, inordnate af∣fection, evill concupisence, and couetousnes, which is idolatry, for which things sake, the wrath of God commeth on the children of disobedence. (3, Col. 5,) And enter yee in at the straight gate for wide is the Gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to de∣struction, and many there be which goe in thereat. But straight is the Gate, and nar∣row is the way, that leadeth vnto life, and few there be that find it: Mat. 7, 13, 7, 19, 5 29, 30, 31. Q. What must I do, when vpon good ground, I shall fid my selfe to bee deli∣uered, from so great a condemnation?
A. Giue thankes to God and say, Great is thy mercy towards me; for thou hast delivered my soule from the lowest hell. Psal. 86.13. Q Why? Is it not in mans power, to purchase Heaven, and to deliuer him∣selfe from Hell? A. Verily, verily, I say vnto you, ex∣cept a man be borne againe of Water, and the Holy Ghost, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of Heaven. (Ioh. .3.) And without holinesse no man can see the Lord, (Heb. 12, 14.) And yet who can say my heart is cleane, I am pure from my sinne, Prou. 20, 9. Ib. 9, 20. Isa. 64, 6. Iob. 9.30, 31. Psal. 93, 5. CHAP. XIX. Of Sanctification. Ob. IF this bee our case, who then can be saued? Mark. 10, 26. A. With men this is vnpossible, but
with GOD all things are possible, (Math. 19, 26.) By whom there shall be a foun∣taine opened, to the house of DAVID for sinne, and for vncleannesse, Zach. 13.1.) And you shall be cleane from all your fil∣thinesse, and from all your Idols will hee cleanse you. Ezek. 36.25. And will turne to you a pure lan∣guage, (Zeph. 3, 9.) that hee who bles∣seth himselfe in the earth, shall blesse him∣selfe in the GOD of Truth. (Isa. 65, 16) And shall serue the Lord, their GOD, and DAVID their King, whom hee will raise vp vnto them. Ier. 30, 9. Hos. 2.16, 17. Zeph. 3, 13. Psal. 37.30, 31. 2. Tit. 14. Ioh. 17, 19. Heb. 10.7, 10. 2. Cor. 13.8. Rom. 8, 9. Zach. 8, 3. Ezek. 37, 28 1. Thes. 5, 23. Math. 13.33. Isa. 4.2. Thus the heart of IEHOSAPHAT was lifted vp in the wayes of the Lord, (2. Chro. 17 6.) And ZACHARIE, and E∣LIZABETH, were both righteous, and walked, in all the ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse. Luk. 1, 6. Act. 23, 1.24, 16. Heb. 13, 18. Act. 10, 22.
Ob. Can the Blackmoores skin be chan∣ged, or a Leopard his spots? And can he bee good, that is accustomed vnto evill? Ier. 13, 23. A. Yea; for if the blood of Buls, and of Goates, and Calues, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the vncleane, sancti∣fie to the purifying of the Flesh: how much more shall the Blood of CHRIST, who through the Eternall spirit, offe∣ring himselfe without spot vnto GOD, purge your Consciences from dead workes, to serue the living God. Heb. 9, 13. Eph. 2, 1. Gal. 1, 23. Ob. I feele the dwelling of sinne in me still? A. So did IOB, (Iob, 9, 20.9, 30.31.) and DAVID, (Psal. 38, 4.51, 3.) and I∣SAIAH, (Isa. 64, 6.) and PAVL (Rom. 7, 18. 1. Tim. 1, 15.) And so though you also doe walke in the flesh, yet doe you ut warre after the flesh. (2. Cor. 10, 3.) Sinne shall not haue dominion over you; for you are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace, (Rom. 6, 14.) For the
law, of the Spirit, of Life, which is in CHRIST IESVS shall free thee, from the law of Sinne, and of Death. Rom. 8, 2. 1. Cor. 12, 3. Q. Why doth CHRIST wash vs who are so vncleane? A. CHRIST loueth his Church, and gaue himselfe for it, that he might san∣ctifie, and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the Word, and that hee might present it to himselfe a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thng, but that it should be holy, and without blemish. Ephes. 5, 25. Hos. 14, 4. Q. Is there nothing required of vs for the furthering of this Grace in our selues? A. Hee that hath this hope purifieth himselfe as hee is pure, (1. Ioh. 3, 3.) you shall therefore sanctifie your selues, and ee shall be holy, for I am holy: neither shall you defile your selues, with any manner of creeping thing, (Leu. 11.44.) But if you walke in the Spirit, you shall not fulfill the
lusts of the Flesh, (Gal. 5, 16.) For every branch that beareth fruit, hee purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Ioh. 15, 2. Rom. 6, 12. Leu. 20, 8.20.26. But his owne iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe, and he shall be holden with the cords of his owne sinnes, (Prou. 5, 22.) For God will giue him vp vnto his owne hearts lusts, whereby he shall walke in his owne counsels. Psal. 81, 12. 2. He must pray saying; O Lord, why hast thou made mee to erre from thy wayes, and hardened my heart from thy feare? Re∣turne for thy servants sake, (Isa. 63, 17.) Create in me a cleane heart, O GOD, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not th holy Spirit from me, (Psal. 51, 10.) Keepe backe thy servant also from pre∣sumptuous sinnes, let them not haue domi∣nion over me. (Psal. 19, 13.) Who can vnderstand his errours? Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, (Psal. 19, 12.) I will runne the wayes of thy Commande∣ments, when thou hast inlarged my
heart. Psal. 119 32, 41, 4. Ioh. 17, 17. Q. When wee find this grace of San∣ctification to bee wrought in vs, what must we then doe? A. Because it is GOD which worketh in you both to will, and to doe, of his good pleasure, (Phil. 2, 13.) Theeore sy yee, God bee thanked, that we were the ser∣vants of Sinne, but we haue obeyed from the heart, that forme of Doctrine, which was deliuered vs. Rom. 6, 17. Q. But shall no Sanctifying grace of GOD be wanting? A. GOD gaue not CHRIST the Spirit by measure: (Ioh. 3, 34.) For it pleaseth the Father, thut in him should all fulnesse dwell, (Col. 1, 19.) And vnto every one of vs is given Grace, according to the mea∣sure, of the guift, of CHRIST, (Ephes. 4, 7.) So that you shall come behind in no guift, (1. Cor. 1, 7.) But of his fulnesse you shall receiue, and grace, for grace, Ioh. 1, 16. Isa. 11, 2, 3. Psal. 68, 19. Zach. 14, 8. Ephes. 1, 3, 4.
CHAP. XX. Of Knowledge, Faith, Trust, and Hope. Q. WHich is the fist of those Graces? A. To know the Truth, (Ioh. 8, 32.) I will (saith God,) giue them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, (Ier. 24.7.) For this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, &c. I will put my Lawes into their minde, and write them in their hearts, &c. And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know mee from the least, to the greatest, (Heb. 8 10. Ier. 31, 33.) And the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the LORD; as the waters cover the Sea, (Hb. 2, 14) Moreouer, the light of the Moone shall be as the light of the Sunne; and the light of the Sunne shall be seaven-fold, as the
light of the 7. dayes, (Isa. 30.26.) Wherby the people that sate in Darkenesse, saw great light; and to them which sate in the Region of the shadow of death, light is sprung vp, Mat 4, 16. And we know that the Sonne of GOD is come and hath giuen vs an vnderstanding that we may know him that is true, (1. Ioh. 5.20.) Which in other ages was not made knowne vnto the Sonnes of men, as it is now reuealed vnto his holy Apostles, and Prophets by the spirit. Eph. 3, 5. Ioh. 1, 18, Pro. 2, 6: Iob. 32, 8. Pro. 18, 15, 14, 6. Thus the Romanes were filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one ano∣ther, Rom. 15, 14. 1, Cor. 1, 5. Psal. 119, 98, 99, 100. ver. Ioh. 15, 15, Ioh; 17, 25, 17, 6. On the contrary, a Scorner seeketh wisedome, and findeth it not (Pro. 14, 6,) he is ever learning, and neuer able to come to the Knowledge of the truth: (2. Tim. 3, 7.) His way is as darkenesse, hee knowes not at what he stumbleth. (Prou. 4, 19.) Hee shall dye without instructi∣on, and in the greatnesse of his folly,
he shall goe astray, Pro. 5.23. Prou. 18.2.14.18.3.32. Iob, 17.4. Pro. 14.8. 15.14. Hos. 4.6. Q. What may this teaeh vs? A. 1. Not to be as the Horse, and Mule, which haue no vnderstanding, (Psal. 32.9. No nor yet to bee as children; but in vnderstanding to be men, (1. Cor. 14, 20.) Suffering the Word of CHRIST to dwell in you richly in all wisedome: Col. 3.16. 2. Pray that GODS wayes may bee knowne vpon earth, and his sauing health among all Nations, (Psal. 67.2.) And for your selues that you may vnderstand the wayes of his Commandements, (Psal. 119.27.) and behold the wonderfull things of his Law? Psal. 119.18. Psal. 119.7, 33, 34, 73, 125 169.171. ver. 2. Tim. 2, 7. Of Faith. Q. Which is the second sanctifying Grace? A. GOD will fulfill in you all the good
pleasure of his goodnesse, and the worke of Faith with power, (2. Thes. 1, 11.) Wher∣by euery one that hath heard and learned of the Father, commeth vnto CHRIST, Ioh. 6, 45. For STEPHEN was a man full of Faith, (Acts. 6, 5.) And the Faith of the Romanes, was spoken of throughout the whole world, (Rom. 1, 8. Acts, 24, 14, 27.25. Ioh. 10, 42. Q. What may hence be learned? A. Because all men haue not Faith. (2. Thes. 3, 2.) Therefore build vp your selves in your most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost: (Iud. 20.) and saying, Lord increase our Faith, (Luk. 17, 5.) Lord wee beleeue, helpe our vnbeliefe: Mark. 9, 24. Of Trust. Q. It beeing long betwixt the pro∣mise, and the accomplishment of it, how may wee in the meane while bee vpheld?
A. Thou shalt stay vpon the holy one of Israel in truth▪ (Isa 10, 20.) Vnder his Wings shalt thou trust, (Psal. 91.4.) For he is the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are a farre off vpon the Sea. (Psal. 65, 5.) Whereby they that know his name, will put their trust in him, Psal. 9, 10. Math. 12, 21. Isa. 51, 5, Psal. 40, 4, 84, 12. Thus Dauid trusted in the Lord: (Psal. 31, 6.) And the people rested themselues vpon the words of Hezekiah King of Iu∣dah, 2. Chro 32, 8. Psal. 20, 7, 11, 1, 18, 2, 52, 8.144 1▪ 2, 56, 3, 4. Iob. 13, 15. Q. What would you hence inferre? A. Commit thy wayes vnto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to passe, (Psal. 37, 5.) thy thoughts shall be e∣stablished, (Pro. 16, 3.) And happy shalt thou be, (Pro. 16 20.) For it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes. (Psal. 118, 8.) Surely men of low degree are vanitie; and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in
the ballance, they are altogether lighter than vanitie. Psal. 62, 9▪ 115, 9, 146, 3 4 34 22. Isa. 2, 22, 26, 4, 31, 1, 36, 6, Pro. 3, 5. Of Hope. Ob. GOD may not onely delay his promise, but also by some euill occurrent vnsettle my confidence? A. The wicked indeed is driven away in his wickednesse, but the righteous hath hope in his death, (Pro. 14, 32) For Abra∣ham against hope beleeued in hope; (Rom. 4, 18.) so Christ is in you the hope of glory, (Col. 1, 27.) Thou hadst (saith Iou) cast me into the deepe, in the midst of the Sea, and the Flouds compassed me about, all thy billowes and thy waues passed ouer me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will looke againe towards thy holy temple, (Ion. 2, 3.4.) And now Lord what waite I for? my hope is in thee, Psal. 39, 7▪ 46, 2, 33, 22, 119, 81 Psal. 119, 166. Lam. 3, 24. Isa. 8, 17. Micha 7, 7. Tit. 2, 13, Acts 26, 6. Iob, 5, 16.
Q. What vse is to be made hereof? A. Therefore looke you also for the mercy of our LORD IESVS CHRIST, vnto eternall life: (Iud. 21.) And waite on thy GOD continually, (Hos. 12, 6.) For happy is he, that hath the GOD of IACOB for his helpe; whose hope is in the LORD his GOD, which made Heauen, and Earth, Psal. 146, 5, 33, 22, Lam. 3, 25, 26. Hos. 12, 6. Ob. Then is euery one happy, for who will not say, that his Hope is in GOD? A. The hope of the Righteous shall be gladnesse; but the expectation of the wic∣ked shall perish, (Pro. 10, 28.) The eyes of the wicked shall faile, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall bee as the giving vp of the Ghost, Iob. 11, 20, 8, 13. &c. Iob. 27, 8, 9, 10.
CHAP. XXI. Of Loue, Feare, Sorrow, Humility, and Repentance. Q. WHat other Sanctifying Grace will GOD bestow vpon us? A. He will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed to loue the LORD thy GOD, with all thine heart, and with all thy Soule, that thou maist liue, Deut. 30, 6. Pro. 8, 17. Cant. 1, 4, 3, 10. Psal. 26, 8. Psal. 116, 1. 1. King. 3, 3. Thus MARY MAGDALEN shee loved much, (Luk. 7, 47.) I also loue the LORD, (Psal. 18, 1.) Yea LORD, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I loue thee: (Ioh. 21, 17.) And if any man loue not the LORD IESVS CHRIST let him be Anathema Maranatha, 1. Cor. 16, 22. Q. What may this teach vs? A. To pray that the Lord would
direct your hearts into the Loue of GOD, (2, Thes. 3 5.) And that your loue may a∣bound yet more, and more, in knowledge, and in all Iudgement: Phil. 1, 9.1, Thes. 3, 12. 2 Labour to keepe your selues in the loue of GOD, Iud. 21. Of Feare. Q. But that our loue be not exorbitant, wherewith shall it be swaved? A. He will giue you one heart, and one way that you may feare him for euer, for your good, and the good of your Children after you, (Ier. 32, 39.) And you shall feare the LORD, and his goodnesse in the latter dayes, (Hos. 3, 5. Psal. 34, 11. Deu. 4, 10. Isa. 2, 22, 23. Hos 3.5. For thus the Midwiues feared God: (Exod. 1 17) And OBADIAH feared the LORD from his youth, (1. King. 18, 3 12.) So did CORNELIVS with all his houshold, Acts, 10, . Deut. 9, 19, Iob. 1.1.
But the transgression of the wicked, saith within my heart that there is no feare of GOD before his eyes, (Psal. 36, 1, 2,) For the feare of the Lord is to hate evill, as pride, and arrogancie, and every evill way. Prou. 8, 13. Deut. 5, 29. Q. What would you hence inferre? A. Therfore feare the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that feare him, (Psa. 34 9.) Yea let all the Earth feare the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in aw of him. Psa. 33, 8.85, 9. Ier. 10.7. For, 1. There is Mercy with him, that hee may be feared, Psa. 130, 4▪ 2 With GOD is terrible maie∣stie, (Iob. 37, 22.) Hee is a con∣suming fire, even a iealous God, (Deut. 4, 24.) The Pillars of the earth tremble, and are astonied at his reproofe. (Iob. 26, 11.) The foundations also of the Hils mooved, and were shaken, because he was wroth, Psal. 18, 7, 97, 5, 104, 32. Nahum 1, 3.1. Sam. 6, 20. Heb. 10, 31. Hab. 3, 16. Iob. 9, 5.37, 1. Exod. 24.17. Deut. 5, 25, 26. Isa. 2, 10. Ier. 5, 2, 22, 10, 10.
Of godly Sorrow. Ob. If the feare of the Lord bee to hate euill, then wofull is my condition, who haue againe crucified CHR1ST by my sinnes? A. Notwithstanding you shall looke on him whom you haue pierced, and you shall mourne for him; as one mourneth for his onely Sonne, and bee in bitternesse for him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first borne: (Zach. 12, 10.) And you shall remember your owne euill wayes, and your doings that were not good, and you shall loath your selues in your owne fight▪ for your iniquities, and for your abhominations: Ezek. 36, 31, 20, 43. Ezek. 6, 9. Ier. 31, 19, 51, 4. Zach. 13, 4, 1. Sam. 7.2. Thus Gods people gathered themselues together at Mizpeh, and drew water, and powred it out before the Lord, and fasted, and said, we haue sinned against the Lord. 1, Sam. 7, 6. 2, Sam. 2.24, 10, 17, Ier. 3, 25, Iob. 40, 4, 5. But as for the wicked, were they asha∣med,
when they had committed abhomina∣tion? Nay they were not at all ashamed, ney∣ther could they blush, (Ier. 8, 12,) But were Brasse, and Iron, Ier. 6.28, 29, 8, 5, 6, 2, 5. Isa. 22, 12, 3, 9. Of Humilitie. Ob. The pride of my hart is also so great, as that I feare I shall not stoop vnto this? A. There is indeed a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye lids are lifted vp? (Pro. 30, 13) as if they were rich, and stood in need of nothing, (Reu. 3, 17.) We haue heard also of the pride of Moab, (Isa. 16, 6,) And of such which say, stand by thy selfe, come not neere to me, for I am ho∣lier than thou, Isa. 65, 5. Numb. 12, 1. But as for me, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neyther doe I exer∣cise my selfe in great matters, or in things too high for mee. Surely I haue behaued and quieted my selfe, as a Child that is weaned of his Mother: My soule is even as a weaned child, (Psal. 131, 1.) And APOLLO was willing to submit himselfe unto the teaching of AQVI∣LA,
and Priscilla, (Acts. 18, 26.) And therefore whosoeuer is wise, and of know∣ledge amongst you, let him also shew out of a good conversation, his works, with meeke∣nesse of wisedome, Iames, 3, 13 Psal. 75, 4, 138, 6, 147, 6. 2. Cor. 10, 17, 18. Prou. 25, 27, 27, 2, 25.6, 7, 16, 5.6, 16, 18, 18, 12. Galath. 6, 3. Luk. 14, 11. Rom. 12, 16, 12, 3. Mat. 11, 29. Ezek. 21, 26. Ier. 9, 23. (48▪ 29.) 50, 1, 32. Isa. 2, 12, 3, 16. Acts. 12.21. Of Repentance. Ob. But what is confession of sinne, without conuersion from sinne? A. Hee will also heale thy backslidings, (Hos. 14, 4) For vnto you, GD hath raised vp his Sonne IESVS and sent him to blesse you, in turning away every one of you, from your iniquities, (Acts, 3, 26.) And hath also to the Gentiles granted repentance vn∣to life,: Acts, 11, 18) Who were as sheepe going astray, but are now returned vnto the Shepheard, and Byshop of their soules, 1, Pet. 2, 25. Isa. 17, 7, 8.19, 18.19, 19, 21.23, 18. Zach. 13, 4, 5. Ier. 50, 5.
For Zachaeus stood, and said to the Lord, behold Lord the halfe of my goods I giue vnto the poore; & if I haue taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I re∣restore him foure fold. Luk. 119, 8. But the Reprobates they returne, but not to the most high (Hos. 7, 16.) They will not frame their doings to turne vnto their God. (Hos. 5, 4) For their bones are full of the sinnes of their youth, which shall lye downe with them in the dust. Iob. 20.11. CHAP. XXII. Of Zeale. Q. WHat other Grace will GOD worke in vs? A. Zeale, and that first of liking af∣fections. 1. To CHRIST. For Paul and Barna∣bas hazarded their liues, (Acts 15.26,) being ready not to be bound onely, but also to dye at Ierusalem, for the name of
the LORD IESVS Act. 21, 13, Deut, 33, 9. 2 To his word, for saith David, I haue reioyced in the wayes of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches, (Psal. 19.14.) Mine eyes preuent the night watches that I might meditate in thy Word, (119, 148,) My soule breaketh for the longing that it hath to thy Iudgements, at all times (119, 20,) Thy Statutes haue beene my Songs, in the house of my Pilgrimage (119, 54,) O how loue I thy Law? It is my Me∣ditation continually: 119, 97, 122.1. Not to be daunted by any. But hee will speake of GODS testimonies before Kings, and will not bee ashamed, (Psal. 119, 46.) Who though they doe speake against him, yet will he meditate in Gods word: Psal. 119, 23, 51, 69, 83, 143, 157, 161, ver. But is increased by opposition. It is time saith he, for the Lord to worke, for men haue made voyde thy Law. Therefore loue I thy Commandements aboue gold, yea aboue fiue gold, (Psal. 119, 126) And I
will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine owne sight, 2. Sam. 6.22. Acts 21, 13. 3 To his workes I haue not hid saith Da∣vid, thy righteousnesse within my heart, I haue declared thy truth, and thy salvation. I haue not concealed thy louing kindnesse, and thy truth from the great congregation, (Psal. 40 9, 10.) Seaven times a day, I will praise thee, because of thy righteous iudgements. Psal. 119, 164.119, 62. 4 To the worship of God. For David prepared with all his might, for the house of his God. (1. Chron. 29.2. ver. 8, 9.) And the free guifts of the people for the Ta∣bernacle, were more than enough, and therefore were restrained from bringing any more. Exod. 36.5. 2, Sam. 24, 24.1. Chro. 29, 21.29, 13, 14. 2, Chro. 29.32, 33, 30, 24. 2, Chro. 35, 7. Neh. 4.17, 21, 23, 6, 11.7, 7. Ezra. 2.68, Hag. 1, 14. Though the wicked say the time is not come; the time that the Lords house should he built. Hag. 1.2. 5 By reioycing in the good they see in
others. Hauing no greater ioy than to see Gods Children walking in the truth. (Ioh. 3. Epist. 4. And are aliue, if they stand fast in the Lord, 1. Thes. 3, 8. Phil. 2.7. 2. Chron. 29, 36. 6 By loue towards Gods Ministers. For Paul doth beare record vnto the Galathi∣ans, that they would haue plucked out their owne eyes, and given them to him. (Gal. 4, 15.) Priscilla also, and Aquila, haue for his life laid down their owne necks Rom. 16, 3.4. 2. Tim. 1.16. 1. King. 18, 4. 7 Loue to Gods people. I could wish saith Paul, that my selfe were accur∣sed from CHRIST, for my Bre∣thren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, (Rom. 9, 3.) And if (saith Moses to GOD) thou wilt not forgiue their sins, blot me I pray thee, out of thy booke, which thou hast written: Exod. 32, 32. 2. Cor. 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2. 2 Zeale of disliking affections. For Lot that righteous man dwelling among them of the old world, in seeing,
and hearing, vexed his righteous Soule, from day to day, with their vnlawfull deeds, 2. Pet. 2.8. And doe not I hate them O Lord, that hate thee, and am I not grieved with them that rise vp against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies (Psal. 139, 21.) The zeale of thine house hath eaten mee vp, and the reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen vpon mee, Psal. 69, 9. Psal. 119, 53. Psal. 119, 136, 139, 158. vers. Act. 17, 16. Ier. 9 2. Exod. 32, 19. Nehem. 13.21. 25.1, 4. Isa. 30.22. Num. 25, 8. Rom. 15, 3, 9. 2 Phil. 3, 18. Ezra, 9, 3. Dan. 10, 2. 1 Sam. 4, 18, 21, 22. Q. What may wee learne from all this? A. Not to be sloathfull to doe service, but to be fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord, (Rom. 12, 11.) And to be valiant for the Truth vpon the Earth, (Ier. 9, 3.) Know∣ing that if you loose your first loue, God will remoue your Candlesticke out of his place, (Revel. 2, 4.) And if you shall bee
luke-warme, hee will spew you out of his mouth, Revel. 3, 16. CHAP. XXIII. Of Charity, Iustice, and Content. Q. BVt with our loue to GOD, shall wee also haue charitable hearts vnto men? A. You are taught of God to loue one another, (1. Thes. 4, 9.) whereby the Chari∣ty of every one of you all, one, towards ano∣ther, aboundeth, 2. Thes. 1, 3. Q. Wherein shall our Charity to∣wards our Brethren bee exercised, and exprssed? A. 1 Towards their Soules. 1 As STEPHEN, who prayed for his persecu∣ters, crying with a loude voyce; Lord lay not this sinne to their charge, (Act. 7.60.) And as DAVID, who when his Enemies were sicke, his cloathing was Sack-cloath, hee humbled himselfe with fasting, (Psal.
35, 13.) And as ABRAHAM for ABIMILECH, (Gen. 20, 17.) MOSES for PHARAOH, (Exod. 8, 12.) for Israel, (Exod. 17, 11.) and for MIRIAM, Num. 12, 13. 1. Sam. 12, 18. 1. King. 13, 6. Dan. 9, 20. Zach. 1, 12, 13. Acts, 12, 5. 2 As DAVID, (Psal. 32, 8.) and SA∣LOMON, (Prov. 1, 2.) and IOB, who in∣structed many, and strengthened the weake hands, (Iob, 4 3) So to bee a guide of the blind, a light to them which are in darknesse, an instructer of the foolish, a tea∣cher of Babes, (Rom. 2, 19.) In meeknesse instructing those also that oppose them∣selues, if God per aduenture will giue them Repentance, 2. Tim. 2, 25. 2 Towards their Bodies; and there∣in first, Let them be as thine owne bo∣wels in the Lord, (Phil. 20.) That so thy bowels may sound like a Harpe, as for Mo∣ab, and thy inward parts as for Kirharesh, (Isa. 16, 11.) Saying, looke away from me; I will weepe bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoyling of the Daugh∣ter of my people, (Isa. 22, 4.) For how can
I indure to see the destruction of my kin∣dred? Esther, 8, 6. Iob, 30, 25. Ier. 9, 1, 48, 31. Psal. 35.13.14. 2 Sam. 1, 11, &c. 2 In keeping Hospitalitie; as did the old man of mount Ephraim, who com∣ming from his worke, and lifting vp his eyes, hee saw a way faring man in the street of the Citie, hee brought him into his house, and gaue provander to the Asses; and they washed their feet, and they did eate, and drinke, (Iudg. 19, 16, 21, ver.) And as the Brethren of Ierusalem, who gladly receiued PAVL, with other Dis∣ciples of Samaria, and of his compa∣ny, (Acts 21.16.) And as OBADIA, who tooke an hundred Prophets, and hid them by fiftie in a Caue, and fed them with Bread and water, 1 King. 18, 4. 2 Sam. 6.19. Acts 16.34. 3 In giuing Almes; For TABITHA, was full of good Workes, and Almes-deeds, which she did. (Act. 9.36.) CORNELIVS also gaue much Almes to the people, (Acts 10.2.) And the Disciples, every man ac∣cording to his abilitie, sent reliefe vnto the
Brethren, which dwelt in Iudea, and sent it to the Elders, by the hands of BARNABAS and SAVL, (Act. 11.29.) We doe you also to it Brethren of the grace of God bestowed n the Churches of Macedonia; how that  great tryall of affliction, &c. their deepe poverty abounded, vnto the riches of their liberalitie. For to their power, I bare re∣cord; yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselues. 2 Cor. 8.1. 2 Cor. 9.1. 2 Tim. 1.16. Acts 20.34. Rom. 16.1, 2. Act. 4.32. Psal. 37.21. 2 Chro. 28.15. Thus the righteous considereth the cause of the Poore; but the wicked regardeth not to know it, (Pro. 29.7.) For they will send the Widowes away empty, and the armes of the Fatherlesse will they breake. Iob 22.9. Iob 24, 6. Amos 2.7. 2 Sam 23.7. Prou. 12.10. Iudg. 5.23. 2 Chro. 19.2. Isa. 32, 6. Q. What therefore must wee doe? A. Seeing yee haue purified your soules, in obeying the truth, through the Spirit, vnto an vnfained loue of the Brethren, see that yee loue one another, with a pure heart, fervently: (1 Pet. 1, 22.) And bee
yee followers of God as deare children, and walke in Loue, as CHRIST also hath lo∣ued vs, (Ephes. 5, 1.) That as you abound in every thing, in faith, in vtterance, and knowledge, so that yee abound in this Grace also. For yee know the Grace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST that though hee was rich, yet for your sakes he became poore, that yee through his poverty might bee made rich, (2. Cor. 8, 7) Remembring al∣so his words, how that hee saith; It is a blessed thing to giue, rather then to re∣ceiue, Act. 20, 35. 1. Tim. 6, 18. Pro. 17, 17, 14, 21, 14, 31. Luk. 14, 12. 1. Pet. 4, 8. 1. Cor. 16, 1, 2.2, 8, 13. 1 Thes. 4.9, 10. Zach. 7, 9 Iudg. 1, 7. 1 Sam. 15, 33, Leu. 19, 33, 25, 35. 1 Ioh. 4, 20. Nehem. 8, 10. Deut. 15, 7. Mth. 5.42. Ioh. 15, 12. Of Iustice. Ob. I haue obserued some men who haue beene very open handed in relee∣uing the poore, who yet haue made no Conscience to defraud the rich? A. Surely Righteousnesse, and Mercy shall meete together, (Psal. 85, 10.) For I
will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousnesse, (Isa. 60, 17.) Yea, thy people shall bee all Righteous, (Isa. 60, 21.) And thou shalt be called the City of righteousnesse, the faithfull Citie, Isa. 1, 26. Psal. 72, 3. Isa. 26 9. Mal. 3, 3. Prou. 20, 7. Eccles. 7, 15. As for me, my righteousnesse I hold fast, and will not let it goe, my heart shall ot reproach me, so long as I liue, (Iob, 27.6.) For behold heere I am; witnesse a∣gainst mee before the Lord, and before his anoynted, whose Oxe haue I taken? Or whose Asse haue I taken? Or whom haue I defrau∣ded? Whom haue I oppressed? Or of whose hands haue I received a bribe, to blinde mine eyes therewith? And I will restore it you, (1. Sam. 12, 3.) Receiue vs, wee haue wronged no man, wee haue corrupted no man, wee haue defrauded no man, (2. Cor. 7, 2.) The Lord is witnesse, and his annoin∣ted is witnesse this day, that you haue not found ought in our hands, (1. Sam. 12, 4) We haue not taken one Asse from you, nei∣ther haue wee hurt one of you, Numb.
16, 15. 1 Sam. 25, 14, 15, 1, 29, 6. 2 King. 12, 15, 2, 22, 5, 2, 145. 1 Sam. 29, 8. Iob, 29.14. Isa. 51.1, 7. Gen. 6, 9. Deut. 33, 21. Prov. 8, 15. Q. But is the practise of Iustice a guift of GOD common vnto all? A. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not againe, (Psal. 37, 21.) They know not to doe right, saith the Lord, who store vp robberie, and violence in their Pallaces, (Amos, 3.10.) There is no equitie in their goings, they haue made them crooked pathes, (Isa. 59.8.) They will sell the Righteous for silver, and the Poore for a paire of shooes; they pant after the dust of the Earth, on the head of the poore, and turne aside the way of the meeke, (Amos. 2.6.) Among them Iudgement is turned backward, and Iustice standeth farre off; for Truth is fallen in the street, and Equi∣tie cannot enter; yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from evill maketh him∣selfe a prey, Isa. 59.14. Micha, 2.1, 2. Hos. 12.7. Q. What is the danger, which such
wicked oppressors, do bring vpon them∣selues? A. He that doth wrong shall receiue for the wrong that he hath done: (Col. 3, 25,) For I will come neere to them in Iudgement, and I will bee a swift witnesse against those that oppresse the hirelings. (Mal. 3, 5.) For as much as their trea∣ding is vpon the poore, and they take from them burdens of Wheate; they haue built houses of hewen stone, but they shall not dwell in them; they haue planted plea∣sant vineyards, but they shall not drinke the wine of them. The prudent shall keepe silence in that time; for it is an evill time. Amos 5, 11, 3, 15, 5, 4, 7. Hab. 2, 6, 10, 11. Pro. 20, 10. Iam. 5.1. Mich. 6, 12. Deut. 27, 17, 25. Mich. 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, Zac. 5, 1, &c. Q. But I haue obserued none to pros∣per more than these men? A. Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightnesse, than he that is perverse in his way, though he be rich, (Pro. 28, 6) A little that the righteous man hath,
is better then the riches of many wic∣ked, (Psal. 37, 16.) For an inheritance may be hastily gotten, at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not bee blessed: (Prou, 20, 21.) Bread of deceit may bee sweet to a man; but afterward his mouth shall be filled with grauell, (Prou. 20, 17) For as the Partridge sitteth on egges, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth ri∣ches, and not by right, shall leaue them in the midst of his dayes, and at his end, hee shall be a foole. Ier. 17, 11. Eccl. 5, 13. Prou. 12, 27, 13, 11, 10, 2, 20, 17, 16, 8, 21, 7. Iob. 20, 28. Q. What may these things teach vs? A. Therefore with-hold not good from them, to wbom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to doe it: (Prou. 3, 27) Remoue not the old Land-marke, and enter not into the Feilds of the Fatherlesse, (Pro. 23, 10.) Doe no vnrighteousnesse in iudge∣ment, in met-yard, in weight or in mea∣sure. Iust ballances, iust weights, a iust Ephah, and a iust hin, shall you haue: (Leuit. 19, 35.) Trust not
in oppression, become not vaine in Rob∣bery: (Psal. 62, 10.) And let no man goe beyond, and defraud his brother in any matter; because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also, haue forewarned you, and testified: 1. Thes. 4, 6. Content. Ob. Alas, I haue coveted greedily all the day long: (Prou. 21, 6.) and therefore am vpon euery occasion tempted to Inju∣stice: (Eccles. 4, 7, 6, 1, 2. Hab. 2, 5. A. Why so? For I haue coveted no mans siluer, or gold, or apparell, (Act. 20, 33.) Yea, I haue learned in whatsoever e∣state I am in, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am instructed, both to bee full, and to bee hungry, both to abound, and to suffer need, I can doe all things through CHRIST which strengtheneth me. Phil. 4, 11. Iob, 1, 21. 2. Sam. 19, 33, &c. Q. What are these examples to me? A. Therefore take heed, and beware of co∣vetousnesse, for a mans life consisteth not in
the aboundance of the things which hee possesseth, (Luk. 12, 15.) But yet every one that is greedie of gaine taketh away the life of the honours thereof: (Prou. 1, 19,) Moreouer, he that loueth siluer, shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth aboundance with increase: (Eccl. 5, 10) Onely Godlinesse with contentment is great gaine. For we brought nothing with vs in∣to this world, and it is certaine that we shall carry nothing out. And therefore hauing food & raiment, let vs therwith be content, (1. Tim. 6, 6) Which that you may be. 1 Drinke of the water which I shall giue you, of which whosoeuer drinketh, shall ne∣ver be more a thirst; but the water that J shall giue him, shall be in him a well of wa∣ter, springing into everlasting life: Ioh. 4.13. 2 And withall pray, saying; Incline my heart vnto thy testimonies, and not to co∣vetousnesse. Turne away mine eyes from be∣holding vanitie, and quicken thou mee in thy way: Psal. 119.36. Eccles. 6.12, Hab. 2, 13, Prou. 23, 4.
CHAP. XXIIII. Of Sinceritie, and Perseverance. Q. THese were excellent Graces, if they were accompanied with Sincerity? A. True, for GOD himselfe desireth truth in the inward parts; and therefore in the hidden part he shall make thee to know wisedome: (Psal. 51, 6.) For he shall put his law in thy minde, and write it in thine heart. (Ier. 31.33.) Whereby thou shalt stand with thy loynes girt about with truth, (Eph. 6, 14.) And be as the Kings Daughter, all glorious within. (Psal. 45, 13) And as the Elder to the elect Ladie, whom he loved in the truth; for the truths sake, which dwelleth in vs, and shall be with vs for ever; (Ioh. 2, Epist. 1.2.) So that in the vprightnesse of thine heart thou shalt willingly offer vnto the Lord, an offering in Righteousnesse: 1. Chro. 29.17.
For thus Enoch walked with God (Gen. 5, 22.) Behold also Nathaniel, an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile. Ioh. 1, 47. Gen. 24, 40. Psal. 116, 9. 2, King. 20, 3. Acts, 24, 16. Of Hypocrisie. Q. Is this any common Grace? A. Helpe Lord, for the godly man cea∣seth: for the faithfull faile from among the children of men. They speake vanity every man with his neighbor; with flattering lips, and with a deceitfull heart doe they speake, (Psal. 12, 1, 28, 3.) Their mouth is ful of de∣ceit, and fraud, they sit in the lurking pla∣ces of the villages, (Psal. 10, 7.) There is no faithfulnes in their mouthes, their inward parts are very wickednes, their throat is an open sepulture, they flatter with their tongues, Psal. 5, 9. Prou. 20, 14. Dan. 11, 34. Ier. 5, 26. As Iudas who betrayed his master with a kisse, (Mat. 26, 49.) And as Ioab who tooke Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kisse him, and slew him with the o∣ther. 2, Sam. 20, 9. Gen. 49, 21. Ioh, 12 6.1, Sam. 18, 17.
So the house of Iacob (saith God) doe seek me daily, and delight to know my waies, as a nation that did righteousnesse, and forsooke not the Ordinances of their GOD; they aske of me the Ordinances of Iustice, they take delight in approaching to GOD: (Isa, 58, 2.) and yet they bend their tongue like their bow, for lyes, but they are not valiant for the truth vpon the Earth: (Ier. 9, 3.) Neyther haue they cryed vnto me with their harts, when they howled vpon their beds: (Hos. 7, 14. And though they say the Lord liueth, yet do they sweare falsely: (Ier. 5, 2.) They returne vnto me, not with their whole heart, but fai∣nedly, saith the Lord: Ier. 3, 10, Isa. 59, 13. Hos. 8, 2. 2, Tim. 3, 5. For when he slew them, they sought him: Neverthelesse they flattered him with their mouth, and lyed vnto him with their tongue; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his Co∣venant: Psalm. 78, 34. &c. Math. 23.5, 14, 25, verses. 2, King. 10, 31. 1, Sam. 26, 21, 1, 24, 17.
Ob. It should seeme this grace of Sin∣ceritie is very rare, and yet who wil not say, my heart is vpright? Stand apart, come not neere me, I am holier than thou. Isa. 65, 5. A. Most men will proclaime every man his own goodnesse; but a faithfull man who can find? (Prou. 20, 6.) All the wayes of a Man are cleane in his owne eyes, but the LORD pondereth the spirits, (Pro. 16.2) He that is first in his owne cause, seemeth iust; but his Neighbour commeth and searcheth him out: Prou. 18, 17, 25, 14. And therefore, if any man seeme to him∣selfe to be somewhat when hee is nothing, hee deceiueth himselfe: Galath. 6, 3.2. King, 10, 15. Q. What is the danger of Hipocrisie? A. Shall not I visit for those things saith the Lord? shall not my soule bee avenged on such a Nation as this, (Ier. 5, 29.) Yea cursed shall he be that smiteth his neigh∣bour secretly, and all the people shall say A∣men. (Deut. 27.24.) So that the Hypocrites
hope shall be cut off, and their trust shall be a Spiders web. Hee shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand; hee shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure, Iob, 8, 13. Psal. 12, 3. Q. Wherein then lyes the difference, betwixt the estate of the Hypocrites, and the true Nathaniels, in whom is no guile? A. Hee that walketh vprightly, wal∣keth surely; but he that perverteth his way shall be knowne, (Prov. 10, 9.28, 18.) The integritie of the vpright shall guide them; but the perversnesse of the trans∣gressors shall destroy them, (Prou. 11, 3, 5, 6.) By the blessing of the vpright the Ci∣tie is exalted; but it is overthrowne by the mouth of the wicked, (Prou. 11, 11.) For lying lippes, are abomination to the Lord; but they that deale truly are his delight, (Prou. 12.22.) And therefore better is the poore that walketh in his Integritie, than hee that is perverse in his lips, and is a foole, Prou. 10, 29.14.2.19, 1.14, 5.13, 6. Psal. 84, 11.
Ob. But such become great, and doe waxe rich, they wax fat, they shine: Ier. 5.28. A. What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he haue gained, when God taketh a∣way his soule? Will God heare his cry, when trouble commeth vpon him? Will hee de∣light himselfe in the Almighty? Will hee alwayes call vpon God? Iob, 27.8.8.13, 11, 20. Pro. 10.28. Q. What may this teach vs? A. Because as in the water, face answe∣reth face, so the heart of man, to man; (Prou. 27.19.) Therefore let euery man proue his owne worke, and then shall he haue reioycing in him selfe alone, and not in another: Gal. 6.4. 2 Beware yee of the leauen of the Pha∣rises, which is Hipocrisie, (Luk. 12.1.) Let loue bee without dissimulation: (Rom. 12, 9.) And be yee perfect with the Lord your God: (Deut. 18.13.) Not to bee almost, but altogether such as PAVL was, (Acts 26.29.) That so you may bee able to say; Search mee O God, and know my
heart, and try mee, and know my thoughts: see if there bee any way of wickednesse me: Psal. 139.23.26. 1. Math. 6, 1. 3 Pray saying; Let my heart be sound  thy statutes, that I be not ashamed, (Psal. 119.80.) Draw me not away with the icked, and with the workers of Iniquitie, hich speake peace to their Neighbours, but mischiefe is in their hearts: (Psal. 28..) O continue thy loving kindnesse to them that know thee, and thy righteousnes in the vpright in heart. Psal. 36.10. 4 Take yee heed, every one of his neigh∣ur, and trust yee not in any Brother; for very Brother will vtterly supplant, and very Neighbour will walke in slaunders: d they will deceiue every one his neigh∣r, and will not speake the truth: They haue taught their tongues to speake yes, and weary themselues to commit ini∣quitie: (Ier. 9.4.) Put yee not confi∣dence in a guide, keepe the doores of thy Mouth from her that lyeth in thy bo∣some: (Micha, 7.5.) But learne of CHRIST, who did not commit himselfe
vnto the Iewes; because hee knew all men: for hee knew what was in Man: Ioh. 2, 24. The simple man indeed beleeveth every word, but the prudent man looketh well to his goings. Pro. 14, 15. Esa. 59, 14. Ier. 12.6. Of Perseverance. Q. Sinceritie I doe confesse to bee a singular Grace, gracing all the rest; but what assurance can you giue mee of per∣seuering therein? Iob, 27.10. A. The path of the Iust is a shining light, that shineth more, and more vnto the perfect day, (Prou. 4, 18.) If therefore that which you haue heard from the begin∣ning shall remaine in you, you also shall con∣tinue in the same, and in the Father, (1. Ioh. 2.24.) who shall establish you an holy people vnto himselfe, as hee hath sworne vnto you. (Deut. 28, 9.) And shall con∣firme you vnto the end, that you may be blamelesse, in the day of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, 1 Cor. 1, 8. Psal. 84 7. For the Converts continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and fellowship,
and in breaking Bread, and in Prayers, (Acts 2, 42) And the Church of Thia∣tira Her last workes were more than the first: (Revel. 2, 19.) MARY also chose that good part, which was not taken from her: (Luk. 10.42.) And as for mee my foot hath held his steps, his way haue I kept, and not declined; neither haue I gone backe from the Commandement of his lips: (Iob, 23, 11. But haue inclined mine care to performe his Statutes alwayes, euen vnto the end: (Psal. 119, 112.) And if you also (saith CHRIST,) keepe my Comman∣dements, you shall abide in my Loue, even as I haue kept my Fathers Commandements and abide in his Loue: Ioh. 15, 10. Hos. 14, 9. Ob. But I haue seene some in my dayes, who haue beene lights, and lea∣ders of others in the way of Godlinesse, and yet themselues proued Apostates: 1 Tim. 1, 19. Psal. 36, 3.78, 57. Ioh. 5, 35. Ier. 8, 5. Hos. 4, 16. Ier. 2, 32. Prov. 26, 11. A. Verily, verily I say vnto you, whoso∣ever committeth Sinne, is the servant of
sinne. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Sonne abideth ever. (Ioh. 8.34) For every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall bee rooted vp: (Math. 15, 13.) They went out from vs, but they were not of vs; for if they had beene of vs, they would no doubt haue continued with vs: But they went out, that they might bee made ma∣nifest, that they were not all of vs. 1. Ioh. 2.19. True it is, some mens sinnes are open be∣fore hand, going before to Iudgement, and some men follow after: (1. Tim. 5.24.) And many of the first shall be last, and the last first: (Math. 20.16.) Neverthelesse, the foundation of GOD standeth sure, ha∣ving this seale, the Lord knoweth who are his. 2. Tim. 2.19. Ob. While they stood, I could not come neere them, and now they are fal∣len, what lesse can be expected, but that my turne will be next? A. You are not of them that draw backe vnto perdition; but of them which beleeue,
to the sauing of the soule: (Heb. 10..) For (saith God) I will make an euer∣ting covenant with thee, that I will not rne away from thee, to doe thee good,  I will put my feare into thine heart, ut thou shalt not depart from me. Ier. .40 Now the Lord is faithfull, who shall ablish you, and keepe you from evill (2. Thes. 3, 3.) For hee shall giue you ano∣ther Comforter, that hee may abide with  for euer, euen the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receiue; because  seeth him not neither knoweth him: for hee dwelleth in you, and shall bee  you: (Ioh. 14.16.) And you need ut that any man teach you; but as the some annointing teacheth you of all things, d is truth, and is no lye, and euen as it ath taught you, you shall abide in him. 1 Ioh. 2.27. Q. But what must I doe, that this promise of perseuerance may be made good vnto me? A. Pray saying; O Lord GOD of
ABRAHAM, ISAACK, and ISRAEL our father, keepe this for euer in the thoughts of my heart, and prepare my heart vnto thee. (1. Chro. 29.18.) Hold vp my goings in thy pathes, that my foot-steps slip not: (Psal. 17.5.) And make me to increase and abound more and more; and to establish my heart vnblameable in holinesse before thee, even our Father, at the comming of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, with all the Saints: 1. Thes. 3.12. 2 Let him that thinketh hee standeth take heed least hee fall: (1. Cor. 10.12.) Looking to your selues, that you loose not those things which you haue wrought, that you may receiue a full reward: (Ioh. 2. E∣pist. 8.) And hereof I giue you a charge in the sight of GOD, who quickeneth all things, and before CHRIST IESVS, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good Confession, that you keepe the Commande∣ments, without spot, and vnrebukeable, vntill the appearing of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: (1. Tim. 6.13.) For our desire is, that every one of you doe shew
the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope vnto the end. That ye be not slothfull, but followers of them, who through faith, and patience inherit the promises: (Heb. 6, 11.) Lifting vp the weake hands, whch hang downe, and the feeble knees, and ma∣king straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame, be turned out of the way: but let it rather be healed: (Heb. 12, 12.) And grow in grace, and in the knowledge if our Lord IESVS CHRIST, (2. Pet. 3, 18.) That so he that is righteous may be righteous still, and he that is holy, may be holy still: Revel. 22, 11. Heb. 10, 23. Phil. 3.12. 1, Cor. 9, 24.2, Chron. 34, 31.2. Cor. 6, 1. Acts, 13, 43. 2. Tim. 3, 14. Q. Why? what is the danger of fal∣ling away? A. When a righteous man turneth a∣way from his righteousnesse, and commit∣teth iniquitie, he shall even die for the some, he shall even die for his iniquity, which he hath done: Ezek. 18, 24, 26. The Lord indeed is with you, while
you be with him; and if ye seeke him▪ he will be found of you, but if you forsake him he will forsake you: (2, Chron. 15, 2.) And will leade you forth with evill doers (Psal. 125, 5.) And feed you as a lambe in a large place: Hos. 4, 16. Know therefore, and see that it is an e∣vill thing, and bitter to forsake the LORD thy GOD: Ier. 2, 19, 2, 13. Heb. 10, 38. Psal. 73, 27. Iud. 5.6, 2, King. 23, 27. Ezek. 33, 12, Ioh. 2. Epist. 9. Ier. 2, 17. Mat. 15, 13. 2, Pet. 2, 20. CHAP. XXV. Of temptations in generall, and in par∣ticuler of the Flesh. Ob. IF this bee the danger of backsli∣ding, what will become of mee, who am exposed to many temptations? A. There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man; but GOD is faithfull, who will not suffer you to be
tempted, aboue that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape: (1, Cor. 10, 13.) For in that CHRIST suffered, and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted: (Heb. 2, 18.) And will establish you, and keepe you from evill: (2. Thes. 3, 3.) As well as hee did PAVL who fought a good fight, who finished his course, and kept the faith, (2, Tim. 4, 7. Revel. 3, 10) And therefore pray you also, that you en∣ter not into temptation: Luk. 22, 40. Ob. But is not GOD said to lead men into Temptation? how say you then that he will deliuer vs out of temptation? A. Let no man say when hee is temp∣ted, I am tempted of GOD; for GOD cannot bee tempted with evill, neyther tempteth hee any man; but every man is tempted when hee is drawne away of his owne Concupiscence, and is entised: 1. Iam. 13.14. Ob. If the case stand thus, what shall I doe, who haue so much flesh remai∣ning in me?
A. Is there no balme in Gilead? is there no Phisitian there? Why then is not the health of the Daughter of my people reco∣vered? Ier. 8.22. Ob. Alas this corruption is growne to such a head, as is not now to be subdued? A. Though your iniquities prevaile against you yet he shall purge them away, (Psa. 65 3 Moreover every valley shall be exalted▪ and every mountaine and hll shall be made low, and the crooked things shalbe made straight and the rough places plaine: (Isa. 40 4.) For the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through GOD, to the pulling downe of strong holds, ca∣sting downe imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of GOD, and bringing in∣to captivity every thought, to the obe∣dience of CHRIST: 2, Cor. 10, 4. Acts 9, 20. Ob. But doe not you as PAVL did of himse fe, say of your selfe, that what I would doe, that I doe not, but what I hate that doe I? Rom. 7, 15, 23. Gal. 5.17.
A. If I doe that I would not, I con∣sent vnto the law that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me: (Rom. 7, 16.) And though I walke in the flesh, yet doe I not warre after the flesh, (2, Cor. 10.3.) For the Lord is that spirit, and where the spi∣rit of the Lord is, there is liberty: (2, Cor. 3, 17) Therefore I thanke GOD through IESVS CHRIST our Lord, hat with the mind I serue the Law of GOD, though with the flesh the Law of sinne: Rom. 7, 25. Q. What is required of vs to be done, for the furthering of this Grace in our selues? A. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as stran∣gers, and Pilgrims, abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against the Soule. 1, Pet. 2, 11. 2 Pray saying, keepe backe thy Servant from presumptuous sinnes; let them not haue dominion over me; then shalt thou be vpright, and innocent from the great trans∣gression: Psal. 1 13.
Ob. Notwithstanding, doe what I can this burthen of sinne presseth me ve∣ry sore? A. Come vnto me all ye that labour, and are heauy laden, and I will giue you rest: (Mat. 11.28.) For I am not come to call the Righteous, but sinners to repentance: Mat. 9.13. Ob. Behold we come vnto thee, for thou art the Lord our God, (Ier. 3, 22.) But we haue gone astray like lost sheepe, (Psal. 119, 176.) And the way of man is not in himselfe; neither is it in man that walketh to direct his steps, Ier. 10, 23. A. I am not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel: (Mat. 15, 24.) Ther∣fore I am come to saue that which was lost (Mat. 18, 11.) and to bring againe that which was driven away, (Ezek. 34.16.) For how thinke you? If a man haue an hundred sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leaue the ninety, and nine, and goeth into the Mountaines, and seeke that which was gone astray &c. Even so it is not the will of the Father which is in Heaven, that
one of these little ones should perish: Mat. 18, 12, 10, 6. Luk. 15, 8, &c. Ob. The worst as yet remaines; for though I see my way before me, yet can I not walke therein? A. The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weake, (Math. 26, 41.) Yet a bruised reed will he not breake, and smoa∣king flaxe shall he not quench, till hee send forth Iudgement vnto victory: (Mat. 12, 20.) And hee said vnto me, my grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weaknesse: 2, Corinth. 12, 9. Ob. All this while my appetite after 2Grace is not alayed? A. I will powre waters vpon him that is thirsty, and flouds vpon the dry ground, (Isa. 44, 3) For as the Scriptures haue said out of his belly shall flow Rivers of li∣uing water: which bee spake of the spirit, which they that beleeue on him should re∣ceiue. (Ioh. 7, 38, 39.) I am also the bread of life he that cōmeth vnto me shal neuer hun∣ger, and he that beleeueth on me shall never
thirst: Iohn, 6, 35, 4, 13. Luke, 1, 53. Ob. It is not meet to take the Chil∣drens bread, and to cast it vnto Dogges: Mat. 15, 26. A. True, yet the Dogs eate of the crums which fall from the Masters table: (Mat. 15, 27.) And therefore, if any man thirst let him come vnto CHRIST, and drinke: (Ioh. 7, 37.) And hee that hath no money come; yea buy, and eate; yea come buy wine, and milke with∣out money, and without price. Where∣fore doe you spend money on that which is not bread? And your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently vnto me and eate that which is good, and let your soule delight it selfe in fatnesse. In∣cline your eare come vnto him; heare, and your soule shall liue, (Isa. 55, 1.) And the spirit, and the bride say, come; and let him that is a thirst come▪ and whosoever will, let him take of the Wa∣ters of life freely: Revel. 22, 17. Ioh. 4, 10.
Q. But in comming shall I not bee rejected? A. All that the Father giveth mee shall come to mee, and him that commeth to me, I will in no wise cast off. Ioh. 6.37. Ob. Sir giue mee then this water that I thirst not: (Ioh. 4.15.) For notwith∣standing all you haue said; It is the ve∣ry breaking of my heart, to thinke that I can serue GOD no better? A. The Sacrifices of GOD are a bro∣ken Spirit; a broken, and a contrite heart, God will not despise: (Psal. 51 17.) For thus saith the high, and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternitie, whose name is Holy. I dwell in the high, and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite, and humble spirit, to reviue the spirit of the humble, and to reviue the heart of the contrite ones: (Isa. 57.15.) To open the blind eyes, to bring the Prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darknesse, out of the prison house: (Isa. 42.7.) That they might bee called the trees of Righteousnesse, the plan∣ting of the LORD, that hee might be
glorified. (Isa. 6.2, 3.) Therefore turne yee to the strong holds ye prisoners of hope; for even to day doe I declare, that I will render double vnto thee: Zach. 9, 12. Isa. 49.8.61. 1. Psal. 34.18.147, 3. Ob. These are sweet promises I con∣fesse; but yet I want comfort still. A. The Lord God hath given CHRIST the tongue of the Learned, that hee should know how to speake a word in season to him that is wearie: (Isa. 50, 4) Blessed there∣fore are you that mourne, for you shall bee comforted. Math. 5.4. Ob. Yet for all this the distresses of my soule are such, as bee intollerable to beare, and how to bee deliuered I know not? A. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voyce of his servant, that walketh in darknesse, and hath no light, let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay vpon his GOD: (Isa. 50.10.) and seeke vnto him that maketh the seaven Starres, and Orion, and turneth the shadow of Death, into the morning, and maketh
the day darke with night; that calleth for the waters of the Sea, and powreth them t vpon the face of the earth; the LORD his name. Amos, 5, 8. CHAP. XXVI. Of the Temptations of the Devill. Ob. THough I should preuaile a∣gainst the motions of the Flesh this feare yet remaines, least by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled EVE, through his subtiltie, so my minde should be corrupted from the simplicitie that is in CHRIST. 2. Cor. 11.3. Iob, 1.7. A. Resist the Devill, and hee will flie from you: (Iam. 4.7.) Now is the iudge∣ment of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be cast out. Ioh. 12, 31. Ob. What hope haue wee to preuaile against so potent an Enemy? A. I haue written vnto you Young men,
because yee haue overcome the wicked o (1. Io. 2.14.) For wee know that hee that is begotten of GOD keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not: ( Ioh. 5.18.) For the Church of Pergam dwelling even where Sathans throne wa yet held fast her professon. Revel. 2.13 Iob, 2.3. Ob. It is not possible for mee in m owne stength to preuaile? A. For this pupose appeared the Son of GOD, that he might destroy the work of the Devill: (1. Io. 3 8.) Who sh bruise Sathan vnder your feet shortly (Rom. 16.20.) And though the Prince of this world come, yet hath hee nought i him: (Ioh. 14.30.) But in two combate was foyled, and in the third was put to flght by him: (Math. 4.1.) So as the gates of Hell prevailed not against him: Math. 16.18. Numb. 21.9. Q. Wherewith was CHRIST fur∣nished against Sathan? A. Forasmuch as the Children are par∣takers of flesh and blood, he also himselfe
likewise, tooke part of the same, that hrough Death, hee might destroy him that d the power of Death, that is the Devill: Heb. 2.14) And the Saints overcame m also, by the Blood of the Lambe. Rev. 12, 11. Q. May not Sathan ouercome at the ast? A. No: for CHRIST hath spoyled Principalities, and Powers, and made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in his Crosse: (Col. 2.15) And when hee ascended vp on hgh, he led Captivitie cap∣tiue: (Ephes. 4 8.) Wherefore hee is able to saue them to the vtmost, that come vnto God by him, seeing he ever liveth, to make intercession for them: (Heb. 7.25.) For hee giveth vnto them Eternall life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any plucke them out of his Fathers hands; be∣cause his Father which gaue them him, is greater than all. Ioh. 10.28. Psal. 68, 18. Ob. But the Dragon, and his Angels doe still continue their fight against vs?
A. I haue put enmitie betwixt thee, and the Woman, and betweene thy seed, and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heele: (Gen. 3.15.) There∣fore though they fight, yet they prevaile not, neither shall their place be found any more in Heaven. Revel. 12, 8. Luk. 10.18. Prou. 29, 27. Q. What shall then become of them, when they are so cast our? A. The great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devill and Sathan, which deceiveth the whole world, hee was cast out into the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him. Reu. 12, 9. Ob. How is it then that when the sonnes of God come to present themselues before the Lord, Sathan is not shut out, (Iob, 2, 1.) but is ready to stand at his right hand to resist them? Zach. 3.1. A. The Lord said; Simon, Simon, be∣hold Sathan hath desired to haue you, that he may sift you as Wheat; but I haue pray∣ed for thee, that thy faith faile not; (Luk. 22.31.) Saying, the Lord rebuke thee,
O Sathan, even the Lord, that hath chosen Ierusalem, rebuke thee. Zach. 3.2. Q. Did the Lord IESVS make good his promise? A. Yea; for though he were once foy∣led, yet he againe recouered, for he went t, and wept bitterly. Luk. 22.62. Q. Was he not by this foile of his, made for euer after the more faint-hearted? A. No: for with greater courage, and boldnes he both Preached, and professed the name of Christ. Act. 2, 14, 3, 12, 4, 8, 4, 19. Ob. Notwithstanding my feare is that at my appearing before Gods tribunall, Sathan will find some thing whereof to accuse me? A. Why art thou so fearefull, O thou of little faith. (Math. 8.26.) For I heard a loud voyce, saying in Heaven, now is come Salvation, and strength, and the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of the Brethren is cast downe, which accuseth them before our God, day and night. (Reu. 12.10.) Moreouer when Christ commeth, he will convince the world
of iudgement, because the Prince of this world is iudged: (Ioh. 16, 8, 11.) There is therefore, no feare in loue; but perfect loue casteth out feare: (1, Ioh 4, 18) And herein is our loue made perfect, that wee may haue boldnesse in the day of Iudgment; because as he is, so are wee in the world: 1, Ioh. 4, 17. Q. What shall then become of the Divell at the last? A. The Divell that deceiveth Men, shall be cast into the lake of fire and brim∣stone, where the Beast, and the false Pro∣phet are, and shall be tormented, day, and night for ever, and ever: Revel. 20.10. Q. What vse make you hereof? A. Therefore reioyce yee Heavens, and yee that dwell in them: Revel. 12, 12. 2 Fight the good sight of Faith, (1, Tim. 6, 2.) And stad fast in the faith, quit you like men, and bee strong (1, Cor. 16, 13.) in the Lord and in the power of his might  ut on the whole armour of
GOD, that ye may bee able to stand a∣gainst the wiles of the Divell: Ephes. 6, 10. 3 Be sober, be vigilant, because your ad∣versary the Divell, as a roaring Lion, walketh about, seeking whom hee may de∣voure: 1. Pet. 5.8. 1, Cor. 16.13. 4 Pray, with all prayer, and supplication in the spirit, and watching therevnto with all perseverance and supplication: Ephes. 6, 18. Ob. If the Divell be cast out, and is gone; what need is there of any more watching against him? A. When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, hee walketh through dry places, seeking rest▪ and finding none: he saith I will returne vnto my house, whence I came out. And when he commeth, he findeth it swept and garnished Then goeth he and ta∣keth 7. other spirits more wicked than him∣selfe: and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first: Luk. 11.24.
CHAP. XXVII. Of the temptations of the World, and in particular of Afflictions. Ob. NOtwithstanding all my watch∣ing and praying, if the Divell should cast out of his mouth water as a flood, vsing the world, as an assistant, am I not in danger to be carryed away of the Floud? A. No; for the earth shall helpe the Woman, and by opening of her mouth, shall swallow vp the Floud, which the Dragon shall cast out of his mouth: (Revel. 12, 16) Thus Gallio helped PAVL against the Iewes: (Acts, 18, 14.) So did the towne-Clarke also against the vprore of the people, (Acts 19, 35.) And the Scribes on the Pharises part, helped him against the Sad∣duces: Act, 23, 9, 23, 22, 21, 31, 32. 2, Co. 11▪ 32. Exod. 2, 6. Est. 9, 3. Ob. But doe wee not see many a man how they are vanquished by the world,
and brought into subiectiō of the same? A. Whosoever is borne of GOD over∣commeth the world, and this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even your faith: 1, Ioh. 5 4. Ob. Wee for our part haue no more power against the world, than wee haue against Sathan? A. CHRIST gaue himselfe for our sins, that he might redeeme vs from this present evill world, according to the will of GOD, and our father, (Gal. 1, 4.) And prayed, not that he should take vs out of the world; but that he should keepe vs from evil. Ioh. 17, 15. Ob. If the child of GOD haue overcome the world, whence is this vanity which is done vpon the earth: that there is iust men vnto whom it happeneth according to the worke of the wicked; againe there be wicked men, to whom it hapneth according to the worke of the righteous? Eccl. 8, 14. A. Can a bird fall in a snare where no fowler is? (Amos 3, 5) Affliction commeth not forth out of the Dust, neyther doth
trouble spring out of the Graue, (Iob. 5, 6.) Is there any evill in the Citty which the Lord hath not done? (Amos, 3, 6.) From the Lord of Hosts which dwelleth in Mount Zion: (Isa. 8, 18.) Who for∣meth the light, and creates darknesse, who maketh peace, and creates evill; he, even he doth all these things, Is. 45, 7. Gen. 45, 8. am. 3, 38, Psal. 17, 12. Q. What may hence be learned? A. Therefore le no man be mooved by these afflictions; for you your selues know that we are appointed therevnto. For we told you before that we should suffer tribu∣lation, even as it comes to passe, and you know it, (1. Thes. , 3.) For shall we receiue good at the hand of God, and shall wee not receiue evill? Iob, 2, 10, 4, 17.1, Sam. 26, 9. Ioh, 18.11. Q Why? what is the disposition of GOD towards his Children in theyr afflctions? A. As a man chasteneth his Son, so doth the Lord chasten them: (Deut. 8, 5.) For whom he loveth he chasteneth, and scour∣geth
every Son whom he receiveth. If ye en∣dure chastising, GOD dealeth with you as with Sonnes. For what Sonne is thee that the Father chasteneth not? If ye be with∣out chastening, whereof all are partakars, then are ye bastards and not Sonnes: Heb. 12, 6. Revel. 3, 9. Q Shew me wherein this fatherly dis∣position of his in affl cting his children is exercised, and expressed? A. 1 He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieue the children of men; Lam. 3, 33. 2 In all their afflictions, he is afflicted. (Isa 63, 9.) For when Israel put away the strange Gods from among them, and ser∣ved the Lord, his soule was greeved for the miseries of Israel: (Iudg. 10, 16.) And his bowels were troubled for them: (Ier, 31, 20.) Saying, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee? (Acts, 9, 4.) For we haue not an high Priest, which cannot bee touched with a fee∣ling of our infirmities e (Hebr. 4, 15.) But hee that toucheth vs, toucheth the Apple of his owne eye: Zach. 2, 8.
Psal. 103, 13 2, King. 13 4.13 23, 2, 14.26. Acts, 26, 14. 1. Pet. 5, 7. Mat. 6, 25, 34 2, Chron. 36, 15. Ob. In all my afflctions I haue had an eye vnto GOD, but yet could ne∣ver discerne any such affection in GOD towards me? A. Then say vnto GOD; O LORD, I haue waited for thee in the way of thy Iudgements; the desire of my Soule is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my Soule haue I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within me will I seeke thee in the morning: (Isa. 26.8.) Looke downe from Hea∣ven, and behold from the habitation of thy holinesse, and of thy glory; where is thy zeale, and thy strength, the soun∣ding of thy bowels, and of thy Mercies towards mee? Are they restrained? Doubtlesse thou art our Father, though ABRAHAM be ignorant of vs, and Israel acknowledge vs not: thou O LORD art our Father, our Redeemer, thy Name is from E∣verlasting:
Isa. 63, 15. &c. Psalm. 77, 7. Q. But why doth GOD lay Af∣flictions vpon vs, being his children? A. What hath the Lord, now done? Is there not cause? (1, Sam. 17, 29.) namely. 1 To prevent sinne. For hee openeth the eare of man, and sealeth their instruc∣tion, that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man, (Iob. 33, 16.) And lest he should be exalted a∣boue measure, there is given him a thorne in the flesh, the messenger of Sathan, to buffet him: (2, Cor. 12, 7.) His way al∣so is hedged vp with thornes, and there is a wall made, that hee may not finde his pathes: (Hos. 2, 6.) Therefore feare not, because of affliction, for GOD is come to prooue you, that his feare might be before you, that you sinne not: Exod. 20, 20, 13, 17. 2 To remoue sinne. For if they be bound in fetters, and holden in the Cordes of Affliction, then hee sheweth them their workes, and their transgressions that
they haue exceeded. He openeth their eare also to discipline, and commandeth that they returne from iniquity: Ioh. 36, 8. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Iacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sinne: (Isa. 27, 9.) and that he may be made partaker of his ho∣linesse: (Heb. 12, 10.) For which cause we faint not, for though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day: 2, Cor. 4, 16. Hos. 5, 15. Isa. 26, 9 4.4. 2, Cor. 7, 8. Zach. 13 9. Ezek. 39, 22: Numb. 12 11. Ezk. 20, 37. Mal. 3, 2. Thus the Israelites in their trouble visi∣ted the Lord, and powred out a prayer when his chastisements was vpon them, (Isa. 26.16.) Mnassen after his affliction, knew that the Lord he was God: 2, Chro. 33, 1, 34, 27. Gen 42 21. Psal. 119, 67. Iob 40, 4 23, 16. Iona. 3.3. Luk. 15.17. But for the wicked, why should they be smitten any more? they fall away more, and more Isa. 1.5.22.12. Hos. 7.10. A∣mos, 4, 6.
3 To make vs trust in God. For wee had the sentence of Death in our selues, that wee should not trust in our selues, but in GOD which raised the Dead: (2. Cor. 1.9.) And GOD suffered Israell to bun∣ger, that hee might make them know, that man doth not liue by Bread onely, but by e∣uery Word, that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man liue: (Deut. 8, 3.) The remnant also of Israell, and such as are escaped of the house of IACOB, stay not vpon him that smote them; but shall stay vpon the Lord, the holy one of Israel in truth. Isa. 10.20. 4 For our tryall. God left HEZIKIAH to try him, that hee might know all that was in his heart: (2. Chron. 32, 31.) And hee left the Cananites to remaine, to proue Israel, whether they would keepe the wayes of the Lord, and to walke therein: (Iudg. .3.4.) IOSEPH also was sold for a Ser∣vant, and his feet were hurt in the fetters, hee was layd in the Iron, vntill the time that his word came; the Word of the Lord tryed him: (Psal. 105, 17.) And a sword
shall pierce through thine owne soule also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed: (Luk. 2.35.) And thou shalt remember all the way, which the Lord thy GOD led thee these 40. yeares in the Wildernesse, to proue thee, and to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keepe his Commandements, or no: Deut 8, 2. Gen. 22, 1. Gal. 6, 17. Reu. 2, 10. 1. Pet. 1, 7. Iob, 23, 10. 5 To make vs conformable vnto CHRIST. That wee may know him, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his Death: (Phil. 3, 10.) For wee all are weake in him, (2. Cor. 13.4.) Filling vp that which is behind of the afflictions of CHRIST, in our flesh, for his bodies sake, which is the Church: (Col. 1.24.) Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your Brethren, that are in the World: 1. Pet. 5.9. 6 That wee may escape the Iudge∣ments of the wicked. When wee are iud∣ged, wee are chastened of the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned with the
World: (1. Cor. 11, 32.) IOSEPH was sent before into Egypt, to preserue life: (Gen. 45, 5, 7) IOSIA was gathered to his Fathers, and to his Graue in peace, that hee might not see all the evill that was to me: (2. Chro. 34.28.) Blessed herefore  the Man whom GOD chasteneth, and eacheth him out of his Law, that he may giue him rest from the dayes of ad∣versitie, vntill the pit bee digged for the Wicked: Psal. 94, 12. Exod. 23.28, &c. 7 To further vs vnto Saluation. For ought not CHRIST to suffer these things and to enter into his Glory? (Luk. 24.26.) And if wee suffer, wee shall al∣so raigne with him: (2. Tim. 2, 12.) For our light Affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for vs, a farre more exceeding, and Eternall weight of Glo∣rie: (2. Cor. 4, 17.) Though now for a season, if need bee, wee are in heavi∣nesse, through manifold Temptations; that the tryall of our Faith, beeing much more precious then Gold that pe∣risheth, though it bee tryed with fire,
might be found vnto praise, and honour and glorie, at the appearing of IESVS CHRIST. 1. Pet. 1.6. Confirme therefore the soules of the Disciples, and exhort them to continue in the Faith, and that wee must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdome of GOD: Acts, 14.22. Phil. 2 8. Luk. 23.40. 8 That we may the better esteeme of Prosperity. My wrath saith GOD, shal not bee powred out vpon Ierusalem by the hand of SHISHAKE. Neverthelesse, they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the King∣domes of the Countries. 2. Chro. 12.7, 8. 9 That wee may comfort others. For whether wee be afflicted, it is for your con∣solation, which is effectuall in the induring of the same sufferings, which wee also suf∣fer; or whether we bee comforted, it is for your consolation, and salvation: 2. Cor. 1.6. Heb. 4.15. 10 For examples sake to the wicked. Because (saith GOD) they haue prophaned my Name, among the Heathen, whether
they went, I will sanctifie my great name, which was prophaned among the Heathen, which they haue prophaned in the middest f them; and the Heathen shall know that I im the LORD, (saith the Lord God) when I shall bee sanctified in them, before their eyes: (Ezek. 36.22.) For I will set my Glory among the Heathen, and all the heathen shall see my Iudgement that I haue executed, and my hand that I haue layd vpon them, &c. And the Heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into Captivitie, for their Iniquitie because they trespassed against me; and therefore, hid I my face from them, and gaue them into the hand of their Enemies. Ezek. 39.21.23. Q I know now that GODS Iudge∣ments are right, and that hee in faith∣fulnesse doth afflict vs: (Psal. 119.75) But what moderation doth hee obserue in the same? A. Hee will not lay vpon man more than is right, that hee should enter into iudgement with GOD: (Iob, 34.23.) Neither hath hee dealt with vs after our
sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our Iniquities: (Psal. 103, 10.) But exacteth of vs lesse than our iniquities deserue: Iob, 11, 6. Ob. Though our Afflictions bee not according to our Sinnes, yet may they presse vs beyond our strength. Iob, 6.12. A. Through the Lords mercies wee shall not bee consumed, because his com∣passions faile not: (Lam. 3 22.) Wee are troubled indeed on every side, but not in distresse; wee are perplexed, but not in dispaire; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast downe, but not destroyed; (2. Cor. 4, 8.) As vnknowne, and yet well knowne; as dying, and behold wee liue; as chastened, but not killed; as sorrow∣ing, and yet alwayes reioycing; as poore, and yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things: (2. Cor. 6.9.) And though wee fall, wee shall not vtterly bee cast downe; for the LORD vpholdeth vs with his
hand: (Psal. 37, 24.) Neither will hee execute the fiercenesse of his anger; hee will not returne to destroy Ephra∣im; for hee is GOD, and not Man, the holy One of Israel in the middest of them: (Hos. 11, 9.) Whereby vnto the vpright there ariseth light in darknesse: (Psal. 112.4.) And when I said, my foot slippeth, his Mercy held mee vp. In the multitude of my thoughts within mee, his comforts delight my Soule: Psal. 94, 18. No man putteth a peece of new cloath vnto an old Garment; for that which is put in, to fill it vp, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse; neither doe men put new Wine into old bottles; else the bottles breake, and the Wine runneth out, and the bottles pe∣rish; but they put new wine into new bot∣tles, and so both are preserved: (Math. 9, 16.) And will GOD plead against thee, with his power? No, hee would put strength in thee: (Iob, 23, 6.) and strengthen thee, with strength in
thy soule: Psal. 138.3, 55.22, 34.20. Isa. 27, 8, 28, 27, 28, 29, 43, 2, 3. Exod. 3, 2. Numb. 11, 11. &c. Ionah, 1, 17. Amos, 9, 8. Ier. 10, 24. Ob. Notwithstanding this moderati∣on, if God should bee alwayes wroth the Spirit should faile before im, and the soules which hee hath made. Isa. 57.16. A. The Lord will not cast off for ever; but though hee cause griefe, yet will hee haue compassion according to the multitude of his mercies: (Lam. 3.31.) And though the Afflictions of the righteous bee many, yet the Lord will deliuer them out of them all. (Psal. 34.19.) The Lord vpholdeth all that fall, and raiseth vp all those that are bowed downe. (Psal. 145.14.) Wherby they shal forget their misery and remember it as waters that passe away. (Iob. 11.16.) And it shall come to passe, that as he hath wat∣ched over them, to plucke vp, and to breake downe, to destroy and to afflict, so will hee watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord. (Ier. 31.28.) who deliue∣reth vs from so great a death, ond doth de∣liuer
vs. In whom we trust, that hee will yet deliver vs. 2, Cor. 1.10. Psal. 41.1.34.6. 1, Kings 11.39. Isa. 28.28. Nehe. 9 28. Ob. If we in respect of affliction should obtaine but a bare, and naked delive∣rance, the comfort thereof would not be great? A. They that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bea∣ring precious seed, shall doubtlesse come a∣gaine with reioycing, and bring his sheaues with him: (Psal. 126, 5.) For thus saith the Lord, like as I brought all this great e∣vill vpon this people, so will I bring vpon them all the good I haue promised, (Ier. 32, 42.) A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one, a strong Nation, (Isa. 60, 22.) As one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and you shall be com∣forted in Ierusalem. And when you see this, your heart shall reioyce▪ and your bones shall flourish like an hearbe, and the hand of the LORD shall be knowne towards his Servants, (Isa. 66, 13.) For hee will
make her wildernesse like Eden, and her Desart like the Garden of the Lord. Ioy and gladnesse shall be found therein, thanks∣giving, and the voyce of melodie; (Isa. 51, 3.) The voyce of the bridegroome, and the voyce of the Bride, the voice of them that shall say; Praise the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good; for his mercy en∣dureth for ever: Ier. 33, 11. Ia. 61, 11.61, 7, 60, 15, 57, 17, 18, verses 58, 8. Zach. 9, 13. Micha. 7, 8, 4, 6, 7. Ier. 30▪ 19. Esth. 8, 16. 2, Cor. 7, 5, 6. Psal. 71, 19 21. Ob. Our case seemes to be too despe∣rate, thus to be delivered? A. O thou afflicted, and tossed with tem∣pest, and not comforted; behold I will lay thy stones with faire colours, and lay thy foundations, with Saphires and I will make thy Windowes of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy borders of plea∣sant stones: (Isa. 54.11.) And though you haue laine among pots, yet shall ye bee as the wings of a Doue, eovered with sil∣ver, and her feathers with yellow Gold: (Psal. 68, 13.) For hee raiseth vp
the poore out of the Dust, and lifteth vp the begger from the Dunghill, to set them a∣mong Princes, and to make them inherit the throne of Glory; for the Pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath set the world vpon them: 1, Sam. 2.8. Psal. 113.7.42.7, 8. Ezek. 37.12. Q. Doth the Lord dispense this goodnesse of his, vnto all men alike in their afflictions? A. The iust man falleth seaven times a day and riseth againe; but the wicked shall fall into mischiefe, (Prou. 24.16.) In the hand of the LORD there is a Cup, the Wine is red, it is full of mixture, and hee powreth out of the same, but the Dregges thereof all the wicked of the Earth shall wring out, and drinke them: (Psal, 75.8.) Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? Or is hee slaine, according to the slaughter of them, that are slaine by him? In measure when it shooteth forth, he will debate with it, hee stayeth his rough wind, in the day of the East wind: (Isay, 27.7.)
For how should I giue thee vp Ephraim? How should I deliver thee Israel? How should I make thee as Admah? How should I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is tur∣ned within mee, my repentings are kind∣led together? Hos. 11, 8. Therefore feare thou not O Iacob my Servant, saith the LORD for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the Nations whether I haue driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure: Ier. 46.28, 19, 10. Numb. 24, 20 Psal. 18, 27. Prou. 11, 28. Morever thus saith the Lord God, be∣hold my Servants shall eate, but yee shall be hungry, behold my Servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirstie; behold my Servants shall reioyce, but yee shall be ashamed; be∣hold my Seruants shall sing for ioy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howle for vexation of spirit. And you shall leaue your name for a curse, vn∣to my chosen, for the LORD GOD shall slay thee, and call his Servants by ano∣ther
name: Isa. 65, 13. Ier. 10, 24, 25. Prou. 14.10. Q. But will it not be long ere this de∣liverance commeth? A. I will bring neere my righteousnes, it shall not be farre off, and my salvation shall not tarry: (Isa. 46, 13.) A little while, and ye shall not seeme; and againe a little while and yee shall see me; because I goe to my Father: (Ioh. 16, 16.) GOD is a very present helpe in trouble: (Psal. 46, 1.) His anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life; weeping may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning: (Psalm. 30, 5.) Af∣ter two dayes will hee reviue vs, in the third day he will raise vs vp, and wee shall liue in his sight: Hos. 6, 2. Come therefore my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, and shut thy doores about thee, hide thy selfe, as it were, for a little moment, vntill the indignation bee overpast: Isa. 26, 20.65, 1, 17, 14, 2, Sam. 24, 12, 13, 25.
Ob. But Zion said, the Lord hath for∣saken me, and my LORD hath forgotten me (Isa. 49▪ 14.) I am weary of my cry∣ing, my throat is dryed; mine eyes faile while I waite for my GOD: (Psalm. 69.3.) Behold I goe forward, but hee is not there; and backward, but I can∣not perceiue him; on the left hand where he doth worke▪ but I cannot behold him; hee hideth himselfe on the right hand, that I cannot see him: Iob. 23.8.9.19.13.3.3.13.26.33.19, 6.4.7.20 13.24.16.12.19.6. Psal. 88.3.40.12.102.3.16.3 Ruth 1, 20. Isa. 38.10. Ier. 20.15.15 10. A. But hee knoweth the way that thou takest when he hath tryed thee, thou shalt come forth as Gold. (Ib. 23 10.) Al∣though thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet Iudgement is before him therefore trust thou in him (Iob. 35, 14.) For the nee∣dy shall not alwayes bee forgotten, the ex∣pectation of the poore shall not perish for ever: (Psal. 9.18.) For can a woman forget her sucking Child, that she should
not haue compassion, on the Sonne of her wombe? Yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee, saith the LORD: (Isa. 49.15.) The hope indeed defer∣red maketh the heart sicke: but when the desire is accomplished, it is a tree of Life: Prou. 13.12. Ye haue therefore need of patience, that after ye haue done the will of GOD, yee might inherit the Promise. For yet a little while, and hee that shall come, will come, and will not tarry: Heb. 10.36. Psalm. 56.8. Q What man ever lived that could be patient, in suffering such things; with so long waiting for deliverance as I haue done? A. He that beleeveth shall not make hast, (Isa. 28.16.) Therfore I wait for the Lord, my Soule doth wait, and in his word doe I hope; my Soule waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning, (Psal. 130.5.) Notwithstanding my confusion is continually before me, & the shame of my face hath covered me. For the voyce of him that reproacheth,
and blaspheameth by reason of the enemy, and avenger. All this is come vpon vs, yet haue wee not forgotten GOD, neyther haue wee dealt falsely in his Covenant. Our heart is not turned backe, neyther haue our steps declined from his way. Though hee hath sorely broken vs in the place of Dragons, and covered vs with the shadow of Death: (Psal. 44.15.) Woe is me, saith IEREMIE, for my hurt; my wound is grievous. But I said, truly this is a griefe and I must beare it? (Ier. 10, 19.) I IOHN, am also your Brother, and Companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdome, and patience of IE∣SVS CHRIST. Rev. 1, 9. Take therefore my Brethren the Prophets, who haue spoken in the name of the LORD, for an example of suffering Affliction, and of Patience: Iames, 5, 10. 2, Timoth. 2, 5. Psalm. 119.83, 141, 143, 39, 9.123, 2, 38, 12, 13. Isa. 26, 8, 39, 8. 1, Sam. 26, 19, 2, 15, 25, 2, 16, 11. Iob. 1.21. 1, Corinth. 4, 12.
Q. Why? what will a mans patience profit him? A. Behold wee count them happy which indure. You haue heard of the patience of IOB and haue seene the end of the Lord, that the Lord is verie pittifull, and of tender mercy. (Iam 5.11.) And so A∣BRAHAM after hee had patiently endured hee obtayned the promise: (Heb. 6.15.) Blessed therefore are all they that wayte for him. (Isa. 30.18.) For the Lord is good vnto them that wait for him, to the soule that seeketh him. It is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord: Lam. 3.25. In your patience possesse yee your soules: (Luk. 21.19.) And let Patience haue her perfect worke, that yee may bee perfect, and intire wanting nothing: (Iam. 1.4.) And take my yoke vpon you, and learne of mee, for I am meeke, and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest vnto your Soules: (Math. 11.29.) And it shall be said in that day, loe this is our GOD, wee haue waited for him, and hee will saue vs; this is the
Lord wee haue waited for him, wee will be glad, and reioyce in his Salvation: Isa. 25.9. Therefore waite on the LORD, bee of good cheere, and hee shall strengthen thine heart; waite I say on the Lord: (Psal. 27, 14.) Saying, why art thou cast downe O my Soule, and why art thou disquieted within mee? Hope in GOD, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God: Psal. 43, 5.42.11.62.1.2. Q. By what meanes may this Grace of patience bee attained? A. 1 If any of you lacke Wisedome, let him aske of GOD, that giveth to all men liberally, and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him: Iam. 1.5. 2 This is my comfort in my Affliction, for his Word quickneth me: (Psal. 119.50.) And if my delights had not beene in his Word I had perished in mine Affliction. Psal. 119, 92. 3 I remembred his Iudgements of old, & haue comforted my selfe. (Psal. 119, 52)
I haue considered the dayes of old, and the yeares of ancient times. I call to remem∣brance my Song in the night: (Psal. 77.5.) I remembred the yeares of the right hand of the most high, I remem∣bred the workes of the LORD, surely I remembred his wonders of old: (Psal. 77, 10, 11.) And so strengthened my hand in GOD: 1. Sam. 23.16. Psal. 119, 52, 143, 5. 2 Cor. 1.10. 2 Tim. 4, 17, 18. 1 Sam. 17.37. Q. When comfort, and deliuerance comes, will it abide by vs? A. Whereas thou hast beene forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an everlasting excel∣lency, a ioy of many Generations: (Isa. 60.15.) For a small moment haue I for∣saken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with ever∣lasting kindnesse will I haue mercy on thee, saith the Lord, thy Redeemer: (Isa. 54.7. Lift vp your eyes to the Hea∣vens, and looke vpon the Earth beneath,
for the Heavens shall vanish away like smoake, and the Earth shall waxe old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein shall dye in like manner; but my Salvation shall bee for ever, and my Righteousnesse shall not be abolished: Isa. 51.6. A woman when shee is in travell hath sorrow, because her houre is come; but as soone as shee is delivered of the Child, shee remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a Man is borne into the world. And yee now also haue sorrow; but I will see you againe, and your heart shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you: (Ioh 16.21.) For you shall bee saved in the Lord with an everlasting Salvation, yee shall not bee ashamed, nor confounded, world without end: Isa. 45, 17. Amos, 9.15. Ob. This your discourse imports much comfort, notwithstanding all which, I doe remaine but in the for∣lorne hope? A. Are the Consolations of God small with thee? (Iob, 15, 11.) Fooles because
of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted. Their soule ab∣horreth all manner of meate, and they draw neere vnto the gates of Death: (Psa. 107.17, 18.) Wherefore then doth a living man complaine? A man for the punish∣ment of his sinnes: (Lam. 3.39.) And why cryest thou for thine affliction? Thy sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, and because thy sinnes are increased, I haue done these things vnto thee: (Ier. 30, 15.) Thine owne wicked∣nesse correcteth thee, and thy backslidings shall reproue thee. Know therefore that it is an evill thing, and a bitter to haue for∣saken the Lord thy GOD, and that his feare is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts: Ier. 2 19. Ob. If our transgressions, and our sinnes be vpon vs, and wee pine away in them, how shall we then liue? Ezek. 33.10. A. O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy selfe, but in me is thy helpe: (Hos. 13.9.) Therefore returne thou back-sliding Is∣rael, saith the Lord, and I will not cause
mine anger to fall vpon you; for I am mer∣cifull, saith the Lord, and I will not keepe anger for ever. Onely acknowledge thine iniquities, that thou hast transgressed a∣gainst the Lord thy GOD, and yee haue not obeyed my voyce, saith the Lord. (Ier. 3.12.) If thou were pure, and vpright, then surely hee would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous. Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly in∣crease: (Iob, 8.6) It is meete therefore to say vnto God, I haue borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: Iob, 34.31, 32. Wherefore if iniquity be in thy hands put it farre away, and let not wickednesse dwell in thy Tabernacles; for then shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not feare, be∣cause thou shalt forget thy misery, and re∣member it as waters that passe away. And thine age shall be cleerer than the noone-day, thou shalt shine foorth, thou shalt be as the Morning: (Iob, 11.14.) Turne thou therefore vnto thy GOD, keepe Mer∣cy,
and iudgement, and waite on thy GOD continually: (Hos. 12, 6.) And acquaint thy selfe I pray thee with him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come vnto thee: Iob, 22, 21. For did not HEZIKIAH King of Iudah feare the Lord; and the Lord repented him of the evill he had purposed against him? (Ier. 26, 19.12▪ 16. Hos. 10, 12.6, 1. Ier. 26.3, 12.6, 18 8. Amos, 5, 4. Ezek. 18, 27. Iob, 33, 23. Ob. I haue indeauoured my selfe in the worke of Repentance what I can, and yet my Affliction continueth pres∣sing mee very sore? A. Then cry vnto the Lord, and hee shall saue you, out of your distresses: (Psal. 107.19.) Saying, Haue mercy vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake, O Lord heale me, for my bones are vexed: (Psal. 6.2.) Take a∣way thy rod from me, and let not thy feare terrifie me: (Iob. 9.34) Turne thou vnto me, and haue mercy vpon mee, for I am desolate and Afflicted. The troubles of my heart are inlarged, O bring thou
mee out of my distresse. Looke vpon my Affliction, and my paine, and forgiue me all my sinnes: (Psal. 25, 17.) O remember not my former iniquities, let thy tender mercies speedily prevent mee, for I am brought very low. Helpe me O God, of my saluation, for the glorie of thy name deli∣uer me. (Psa. 79.8.) I stretch forth my hand vnto thee, my soule thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Heare me speedily O Lord, for my spirit faileth; hide not thy face from me, lest I be like vnto them that goe downe into the pit. (Psal. 143 6.) O Lord correct me, but in iudgement, not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. (Ier. 10.24.) I am like a flower that is cut downe, which flyeth also as a shadow, and continueth not; and doest thou open thine eyes vpon such a one? And bringest thou me to iudgement with thee? (Iob. 14.2.) Thine hands haue made me, and fashioned me together, round about, yet thou dost destroy me. Remember I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into the dust againe? (Iob. 10.8.) Are not my dayes
few? Cease thou, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a litle, before I go, whence I shall not returne: Iob. 10.20. Psal. 79.5.77.7.85, 4, 25, 6, 7, 39, 12, 13.88.1.88, 14.102.1, 118, 25.119, 77, 143, 8.11. Iob. 10, 1.13, 24.14, 6. Ier. 17, 14.17. Psalm. 42, 6, 119, 107. Isa. 64.8. Q. When by these meanes I haue found comfort and deliverance, what am I then to doe? A. In that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee, though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, & thou comfortest me. Behold God is my Salvati∣on; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord IEHOVAH is my strength, and my song, he also is become my Salvation, (Isa. 12.1.) My soule wait thou onely vpon God, for my expectation is from him. He only is my rocke and my salvation; he is my de∣fence, therefore I shall not bee mooved. In God is my Salvation, and my glory, the rocke of my strength, and my refuge is in God, (Psal. 62, 5.) For thou hast taken away all thy wrath, thou hast turned thy
selfe from the fiercenesse of thine anger, (Psal. 78, 38.) Thou hast delivered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feet from falling: (Psal. 116.8.) My lips therefore shall greatly reioyce, when I sing vnto thee, and my Soule which ho u hast redeemed, my tongue also, shall talke of thy Righteousnesse, all the day long (Psal. 71, 23.) I will say vnto thee, thy Righteousnesse O GOD is very high, who hath done great things, O God who is like vnto thee? Thou who hast shewed me great and sore troubles, hast quickened me againe, and hast brought me vp againe from the depths of the earth: thou hast increased my greatnesse and comforted me on every side: (Psal. 71.19.) To the end that my glory may sing vnto him and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will giue thee thankes for ever. Psal. 30, 12, 49, 15.22, 22, 63, 7.66, 8.30, 3, 103.1, 4.85, 2, 3, 116, 7, 9. Isa. 61, 10, 49.13.38 20. Exod. 4, 31. Luk. 17.15. Psal. 35.18, 85.9, 116.5.
CHAP. XXVIII. Of Persecution. Ob. I Know now, that in the mid∣dest of Iudgement, the LORD will remember Mercie; notwithstan∣ding the feare I haue of falling into the hands of men, is the very breaking of my heart. A. I, Even I am he that comforteth you; who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall dye, and of a man, that shall be made as grasse? And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that spreadeth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, & hast feared continually every day; because of the fury of the oppressor; as if hee were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor? (Isa. 51, 12,) Behold I will make thy Face strong against their Faces, and thy Fore-head strong against their Fore-heads: is an Adamant, harder than flint haue I made thy Forehead:
feare them not, neither be dismayed at their lookes, though they be a rebellious house: Ezek. 3.8. Are not two Sparrowes sold for a far∣thing, and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father; but the very haires of your head are numbred. Feare ye not therefore for you are of more value then many Sparrowes (Math. 10.29.) So that we may boldly say▪ the Lord is my hel∣per, I wil not feare what man can do vnto me (Heb. 13, 6. For the Lord God will helpe me, therefore shall I not bee confounded, therefore haue I set my face like a flint, and I know I shall not be ashamed. He is neere that iustifieth me, who will contend with me? Let vs stand together, who is mine Adversary? Let him come neere to usee, Behold the LORD GOD will helpe me, who is hee that shall condemne me? Loe all they shall waxe old as a Garment; the Moth shall eate them vp. Isa. 50, 7. Numb. 22, 18.38, verses, 24. 12, 13, 23, 8. Heb. 11, 27. Psalm. 140.12.
Ob. But doe I not with these eyes see many of my Brethren, how cruelly they haue beene handled by them? Psal. 22, 12, 13, 143, 3, 4. A. All that will liue godly in CHRIST IESVS shall suffer persecution. (2. Tim. 3.12.) As formerly he that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the Spirit, even so it is now, (Gal. 4.29.) that the Brother shall betray the Brother to death, and the Father the Sonne, and the Children shall rise vp against their Parents, and shall cause them to die. And you shall bee ha∣ted of all men for my names sake: Math. 10.21. These things haue I spoken vnto you, that you should not be offended; they shall put you out of the Synagogue, yea the time commeth that whosoever killeth you, will thinke that hee doth GOD Service. And these things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowne the Father, nor me. But these things haue I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may re∣member
that I haue told you them: Ioh. 16, 1. Notwithstanding if the world hate you, you know it hated me, before it hated you. If yee were of the World, the World would loue his owne; but because you are not of the world; but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the words that I said vnto you, the Servant is not greater then his Lord; if they haue persecuted mee, they will persecute you also: (Iohn, 15, 18.) For if they doe these things to a greene Tree, what shall bee done to the drye? Luke, 23, 31. Math. 10.16.1, Corinth. 4, 9.10 13, 2. Cor. 6.9. Psalm. 22.12. Notwithstanding they can haue no power at all against you, except it be gi∣ven them from aboue: (Ioh. 19.11.8, 20.) For if Balaak would giue vnto Ba∣laam his house full of Silver, and Gold; hee could not goe beyond the word of the LORD, to doe lesse, or more: (Numb. 22, 18, 38, 24, 12, 13, 23, 8.) But vnto
you it is given in the behalfe of CHRIST, not onely to beleeue, but also to suffer for his sake: Phil. 1.29. Ob, The very tonges of these wicked men doe cut like a sharpe rasor: (Psal. 52, 2.) Adders poyson is vnder their lips, (Psalm. 140.3.) Their teeth are as swords, and their iawes are kniues to eat vp the afflcted out of the earth, and the poore from among men, Prou. 30, 14. Iob. 17, 6. Lam. 1, 7. Isa. 8, 18. Psal, 120.4, 22, 13.69, 11, 31, 12, 13 verses, 22.6.7.8. verses, 71.10, 83.3. Ier. 18.18. Deut. 32.33. A. Beloved remember ye the words which were spoken, before of the Apostles of our LORD IESVS CHRIST, how that they told you there should be mockers in the last times, (Iud. 17.18.) And call to remem∣brance the former dayes, in the which after ye were illuminated, yee endured a great fight in afflictons; partly while yee were made a gazing stock, both by reproches and afflictions, and partly while yee be∣came Companions of them that were so vsed: (Heb, 10, 32.) But as
the LORD turned the Curse of Baa∣lam into a Blessing: (Deut 23, 5.) So it may bee hee will looke on your Af∣fliction also, and requite good for their cursing this day: (2. Sam. 16, 12.) And if yee bee reproached for the name of CHRIST, happie are ye; for the Spirit of Glory, and of GOD resteth vpon you, which on their part he is evill spoken of, but on your part hee is glorified: 1. Pet. 4, 14. Therefore hearken vnto me, yee that know righteousnesse, the people in whose heart is my Law; feare yee not the reproa∣ches of men, neyther be afraid of theyr revilings; for the Moth shall eat them like a Garment, and the Worme shall eate them like Wooll, but my Righteous∣nesse shall bee for ever, and my salvation shall be from Generation, to Generation. (Isa. 51.7.) And consider him which indured such contradiction of sinners, least you be weary and faint in your minds, (Heb. 12.3.) And goe forth vnto him with∣out the Camp, bearing his reproach, (Heb. 13.13.)
And say you vnto such a one, why boastest hou in mischiefe, O mighty man? The good¦esse of God indureth continually. (Psa. 52..) And rherfore I will be more vile than hus, and will be base in my owne sight. . Sam. 6.22. Math. 10.24. And turne vnto God and say; haue ercy vpon vs O Lord, haue mercy vpon s; for we are exceedingly filled with con∣empt, our soule is exceedingly filled with he scornes of those that are at ease, and ith the contempt of the proud. (Psal. 123..4.) Remoue farre from vs reproch, and ntempt, for wee haue kept thy testimo∣ies: Psal. 119.22. Ob. They do not only vse threatning nd reuiling words, but they lay to my harge things I neuer did: (Psal. 35.1.) They reioyce at me, as if I had beene ound among theeues. Ier. 48.27. Act. 6.11.3. 14. ver. 25.7.17.6. Math. 11.18.26.65. Ioh. 10.20.7.12. Ier. 15.10. Isa. 54.17. A. Also now thy witnesse is in heauen, nd thy record on high. (Iob. 16.19.) The Lord will not leaue thee in the hand of the
wicked nor condemne thee when thou art iudged: (Psal. 37, 32.) For he shall stand at thy right hand, to saue thee from those that condemne thee: (Psal. 109, 31.) And will put to silence those lying lippes, which speake grievous things, proudly, and con∣temptuously against the Righteous, (Psal. 31, 18.) wherein they thinke it strange that you runne not with them vnto the same excesse of ryot, speaking evill of you; who shall giue an account vnto him that is ready to iudge, the quicke, and the dead: 1. Pet. 4, 4. Isa. 66▪ 5. Blessed therefore are you when men shall reuile you, and Persecute you, and shall say all manner of evill against you, falsly, for my sake. Reioyce, and bee exceeding glad; for great is your re∣ward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you: Math. 5, 11. Luk. 6, 22.) But let none of you suffer as a Murtherer, or as a Theefe, or as an evill doer, or as a busie body in other mens matters; yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him
not bee ashamed, but let him glorifie OD in this behalfe: (1. Pet. 4, 15.) nd haue your conversation honest a∣ng the Gentiles, that whereas they ke against you, as evill doers, they y by your good Workes, which they shall ld, glorifie GOD in the day of Visi∣ion. For so is the will of God, that by ll doing, yee may put to silence the ig∣rance of foolish men: (1. Pet. 2, 12, 15.)  being reviled, wee blesse; being per∣uted, wee suffer it; being defamed, wee reat; wee are made as the filth of the rld, and the of-scouring of all things o this day. 1. Cor. 4, 12. Thus doing mayest thou pray; Deli∣ my soule, O Lord, from lying lips, el from a deceitfull tongue: (Psal. 120.) And who is hee then that will harme , if you bee followers of that which is nd? (1. Pet. 3, 13.) Or if any shall so e, as the Sparrow by wandring, and the allow by flying escape, so the Curse cause∣e, shall not come: Prou. 26, 2. Psalm. 19, 161.
Ob. But I shall one day fall into their hands: (1. Sam. 27, 1.) And be brough before Governours, and Kings for the Name of CHRIST: (Math. 10.18.) And what alas shall I then doe? A. Doe as TIMOTHY did, who pro∣fessed a good profession before many wit∣nesses: (1. Tim. 6.12.) And as the Church of Pergamus did, who held fast his name and denied not his Faith, even in those dayes wherein ANTIPAS his faithful Martyr, who was slaine where Sathan dwelt: (Reu. 2.13.) And if they forbid you to speake any more in that Name, then say vnto them, whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken vnto you, more than vnto God, iudge yee. For wee cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard: Act. 4 19.20, Ob. Ah Lord God; behold I can not speake, for I am a Child. Ier. 1.6. A. The hand of the Lord shall be vpon thee, and shall open thy mouth, and thou shalt bee no more dumbe: (Ezek. 33, 22.) The tongue of the Stammerers shall be rea∣dy
to speake plainly: (Isa. 32.4.) For out f the mouthes of Babes, and sucklings hath  ordained strength, because of his E∣mies, that hee might still the enemy, and avenger. Psal. 8, 2. Say not then I am a Child, for thou shalt nto all that I shall send thee, and what∣ever I command thee thou shalt speake. Ierem. 1.7.) For who hath made mans Youth? Or who maketh the dumbe, and be deafe, haue not I the Lord? Now herefore I will be with thy mouth, and uch thee what thou shalt say. Exod. 4, 11. When they therefore deliver you vp, ike no thought, how, or what you shall eake, for it shall be given you in that ime houre, what you shall say: (Math. 10, 19. Luk. 21.14) And I will giue you a outh, and wisedome, which all your ad∣versaries shall not be able to gaine-say, nor resist: (Luk. 21.15. Act. 6, 10.) For the Scripture saith, Whosoever beleeveth on him shall not be ashamed: (Rom. 10, 11.) For with the Heart man beleeveth vnto Righteousnesse, and with the Mouth con∣fession
is made vnto salvation. Rom. 10, 10 You having therefore the same spirit of Faith, according as it is written, beleeved, and therefore haue I spoken; you also beleeue, and therefore speake: (2. Cor 4, 13.) And be not afraid, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no ma shall set on thee to hurt thee: (Acts, 18.9.) But sanctifie the Lord God in your heart and be ready alway to giue an answere to e∣very man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, and that with meekenes, and feare, 1. Pet. 3, 15. Math. 10, 32. Prou. 16.1. Acts, 4.9. Luk. 12.12. Ob. If for the hope of Israel I should thus stand in defence of the truth, I shall for my labour be cast into some Dungeon: (Ier. 38.6.) be bound with a chaine, (Acts 28.20.) And my feet hurt with fetters of Iron. Psal. 105.18. Ezek. 19.9. Iohn, 21, 28. A, Though you suffer trouble as an e∣vill doer, yet the word of God is not bound (2. Tim. 2.9.) You may be a bondman in deed, yet the Lord God will not forsake you
in your bondage, (Ezra. 9, 9.) No more than he forsooke PAVL and SILAS, who ing psalmes in Prison, Acts, 16, 25. For the Lord heareth the poore, and des∣seth not his Prisoners, (Psal. 69.33.) et hath broken the Gates of Brasse, and t the Barres of iron in sunder: (Psal. 107.6.) And bringeth out those that are und with chaines, (Psal. 68, 6.) For the iron gate opened vnto Peter of its owne ucord, whereby hee escaped the hands of Herod, Acts, 12, 10. Ier. 38.13.52.31. Psal. 102.19.116 16. Ob. It may be they will not alwayes de∣aine me a prisoner; but which is worse,  may bee banished into the Land of Strangers abroad: Reu. 19.10. Heb. 11.38. Act. 8, 1. A. Although they shall cast you a far off mong the Heathen, and although they do scatter you among the Countries; yet will the to you as a little Sanctuary in the Coun∣tries where you shall come: (Exek. 11.16.) And when you are in the Land of your Enemies, I will not cast you away,
neither will I abhorre you to destroy you vtterly, and to breake my Covenant with you; for I am the Lord your GOD: (Leuit. 26.44.) But I will giue you a re∣viuing there: (Ezra, 9 8.) And make you to be pittied of all those that shall car∣ry you Captiue: (Psal. 106, 46) And make the Enemy to intreat you well: (Ier. 15.11.) And I will be with you as with IOSEPH in Egypt, who was a prosperous man, (Gen. 39, 2.) forgat all his toyle, and all his Fathers house, and became fruitfull in the Land of his Affliction: Gen. 41, 51, 52, 46 3, 47 27, 23, 11. Ier. 40.4, 37, 21. Deut. 4, 29. Reuel. 1.9, 10. Psal. 105, 12. Ier. 31, 10. 2 Moreouer, heare the Word of the Lord, and declare it in the Isles a farre off, and say, hee that scattered Israel, will ga∣ther him: (Ier. 31.10.) Feare not, for I am with them, I will bring their seed from the East, and gather them from the West. I will say to the North giue vp, and to the South keepe not backe. Bring my Sonnes from farre, and my Daughters from
the ends of the earth even every one that is called by my name, for I haue created him for my glory: (Isa. 43, 5.) For as the Shepheard seeketh out his flocke, in the day that he is among his Sheepe that are scat∣tered; so will I seeke out my Sheepe, and will deliver them out of all places where they haue beene scattered in the cloudie, and darke day. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the Countries, and I will bring them to their owne Land: (Ezek. 34, 12.) So that the redeemed of the Lord, shall returne and come with singing vnto Zion, and everlasting ioy shall bee vpon their head, they shall obtaine gladnes, and ioy, and sorrow, and mourning shall flee away: Isa. 51, 11. Say ye therefore, turne againe our cap∣tivity O Lord, as the streames in the South: (Psal. 126, 4.) O that Salvation were come out of Zion, when the Lord brin∣geth backe the captivity of his people, Ia∣cob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad. Psalm. 14, 7, 53.6, 81, 5, 68, 22.
Deut. 30, 1. Gen. 15.15.48, 21. Isa. 14, 12 26, 2, 9, 10.30, 10, 27, 13, 49.25, 60, 15. Ier. 23, 3 24, 5. Ezek. 36, 24. Amos, 9, 14. Zach. 10, 10. Exod. 12.41. Ob. But in the meane while would it not greeue a man to part with his deare friends, with what else he hath? Ier. 5, 2. Lam. 5, 15, 3, 45, 46. Dan. 9, 15. A. No moe than it would haue grie∣ved Leui, who said vnto his Father, and to his mother, I haue not seene him, neither did he acknowledge his Brethren; nor knew his owne Children, (Deut. 33.9.) Or than others, who tooke ioyfully the spoyling of theyr goods, knowing in themselues, that they haue in Heaven a better, and an in∣during substance (Heb. 10, 34.) For I say vnto you, there is no man that hath left house, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my sake, or the Gospell, but he shall receiue an hundred fold; now in this world Houses, and Brethren, and Sisters and Mothers, and Children, and lands with Persecutions, and in the world to come, life everlasting.
Mark. 10, 29, Luk. 14, 26, 14.33.17.32. Ob. But more greevous things than these are imposed: for, for his sake are we killed all the day long, and are counted as sheepe for the slaughter: Psal. 44, 22, 74.4. Lam. 3.42. A. Yet I will not leaue you comfortlesse, (Ioh. 14, 18.) But as my sufferings abound in you so your consolation also aboundeth: (2, Cor. 1, 5.) For I will pray the Father, and hee shall gue you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receiue; because it seeth hm not, neither knoweth him. But ye know him for hee dwelleth with you, and shall bee in you: (Ioh. 14.16.) Whereby our hope of you is stedfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the Consolation. 2, Cor. 1, 7. And therefore thinke it not strange con∣cerning the fierie tryall, which is to try you, as if some strange thing hapned vnto you: (1 Pet. 4.12.) But rather glory in tribulation, (Rom. 5, 3.) As well as others, who were
stoned, who were sawne asunder, who were tempted, who were slaine with the Sword, and otherwise tortured, and yet not accep∣ting deliuerance, that they might obtaine a better resurrection: (Heb. 11, 35, 37.) So that we our selues gloried in the Churches of GOD, for the faith, and patience of such, in all their persecutions, and tribula∣tions, which they endured: 2, Thes. 1, 4. Mth. 10, 28. Luk. 17, 33. Dan. 3.16. Ob. If my torments should be as long, as violent, I shall shrinke vnder them? A. The rod of the wicked shall not rest vpon the lot of the Righteous, least the righteous put forth his hand vnto wicked∣nesse,  Ps l, 125,3) For except those dayes should be shortned, there should no flesh be saved, but for the elects sake those dayes shall be shortned. (Math. 24 22.) For yet a very little while, and the indig∣nation shall cease, and mine anger in theyr destruction: Isa. 10, 25. 2, Tim. 3.9, 2, 4.17. Q. When deliverance comes, shall the same last, and continue?
A. For the oppression of the poore, for the sighing of the needie, now will I arise saith the Lord, I will set him in safetie from him that puffeth at him: (Psal. 12.5.) And then there shall bee no more a pricking briar vnto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorne, of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord: Ezek. 28, 24. Therefore heare now this thou afflic∣ted, and drunken, but not with the Wine, thus saith thy Lord, the LORD and thy GOD, that pleadeth the cause of his peo∣ple; behold I will take out of thine hand the Cup of trembling; even the Cup of the Dregs of my fry, thou shalt no more drinke it againe; but I will put it into the hands of them that afflict thee, which haue said to thy soule, bow downe, that we may goe over, and thou hast layd thy body as the ground, and as the street to them that went over: Isa, 51, 21, &c. Q. What may these comfortable pro∣mises, concerning the persecution of the Saints teach?
A. To indure hardnesse, as a good Soul∣dier of IESVS CHRIST, (2 Tim. 2, 3.) And be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, but be thou partaker of the afflic∣tions of the Gospell, according to the pow∣er of GOD: (2. Tim. 1, 8.) And in no∣thing be terrified by your Adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdi∣tion; but to you of Salvation, and that of GOD: (Phil. 1 28.) Seeing it is a righte∣ous thing with God, to recompence Tribu∣lation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled, rest with vs, when the Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, 2: Thes. 1, 6. Wherefore reioyce, in as much as you are made partakers of Christs sufferings; that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also, with exceeding ioy: (1. Pe. 4.13.) For when you are tryed, you shall receiue the Crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him, (Iam. 1, 12,) For the which cause, I also suffer these things. Neverthelesse I am not shamed, for I know whom I haue beleeved,
and I am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him, against that day. (2. Tim. 1.12.) Where∣fore let them also that suffer according to the will of GOD, commit the keeping of their soules to him in well doing, as vnto a faithfull creator. 1 Pet. 4.19. Reu. 20.6. 7.13. Luk. 12, 6. 1 Sam. 23.16.1.30.6. Act 14 22. 2 Pray saying; O God, the proud are risen against vs, and the assembly of wicked men haue sought after our soule and haue not set thee before them. Psal, 86, 14) Haue a respect vnto the couenant; for the darke places of the earth are full of the habitation of cruelty: (Psal, 74, 20.) Heare vs, O Lord our GOD, lighten our eyes, least wee sleepe the sleepe of death: (Psal. 13, 3.) Arise O LORD, lift vp thy selfe, because of the rage of our Enemies, awake for vs to the iudgement thou hast commanded  Psal. 7, 6. Psal. 17, 7, 17, 12, 7, 1, 119, 122, 140, 4, 25, 19. Lam. 3, 47, &c. Attend vnto our cry, for wee are
brought very low, deliver vs from our per∣secutors, for they are stronger than wee: (Psal. 142 6) Consider our enemies for they are many. (Psal 25.19) Giue vs helpe in trouble, for vaine is the helpe of man, Psal. 108, 12, 8, 6 56, 1. Psal 74 20. 2, Chron. 20, 6, 12. Act 4, 26. Our enemi haue now compassed vs in our steps: they haue set their eyes bowing downe to the earth, Psal. 17, 1.) They haue hid a snare for vs and cords; they haue spread a net by the way side; they haue set grinnes for vs: (Psal. 140, 5.) Rid, and deliver vs from the hands of strange children; whose mouthes speake vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of falshood: (Psal. 144, 11, 83, 5, 74, 20.) Wee haue done Iudgement and Iustice, leaue vs not to our oppressors: (Psal. 119.121.) For they haue digged a Pit for vs, which is not af∣ter thy Law: (Psalm. 119, 85) Let integritie and vprightnesse preserue vs, for wee waite on thee: (Psal. 25, 21.) O let the wickednesse of the wic∣ked
come to an end, but establish the iust;  the righteous GOD, tryeth the heart, d the reynes: (Psal. 7.9) Shall the  one of iniquity haue fellowship with thee, uch frameth mischiefe by a Law? Psal. 4 20.) Let none that waite on thee t ashamed, but let them bee ashamed hich transgresse without cause: Psal. 5, 3, 119, 6.35, 23.43, 1, 7, 3. Lam.  59. Thy Citie, and thy people are called by y name: (Da. 9, 19.) Wee are thine, ou never barest rule over them, they re not called by thy name: (Isa. 63, 19.) t now O Lord, thou art our Father, wee t the clay, and thou art our Potter, and we e all the worke of thine hand. Bee not  oth very sore O Lord, neither remem∣r iniquities for ever: Behold see wee eseech thee we are all thy people: (Isa. 4, 8.) Why doth thine anger smoke a∣ainst the Sheepe of thy pasture? Remem∣er thy Congregation which thou hast pur∣hased of old, the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed, this is mount
Zion wherein thou hast dwelt. (Psal. 74.1.) O deliuer not the soule of thy turtle do v vnto the multitude of the wicked, forge not the congregation of the poore for ever▪ Haue respect vnto the covenant (Psal. 74 19.) Abba, father all things are possible t to thee. Mark. 14.36. 2. Thes. 3.2. Ier. 14.9 21. Dan. 9.17. Psal. 79.10.13. Deut. 9.26 Psal. 86.16. Ioel 2.17. Psal. 74.20. Neh 1.10. Thy holy Cities are a wildernesse; Zion is a wildernesse; Ierusalem a desolation Our holy, and our beautifull house, wher our Fathers praised thee, is burned vp wit fire and all our pleasat things are laid wast. Wilt thou refraine thy selfe for these things O Lord? Wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict vs very sore? (Isa. 64 10.) know that for thy sake wee haue suffered rebuke (Ier. 15.15.) Arise O God, pleade thine owne cause, remember how the foolish men reproach thee daily. Forget not the voyce of thine Enemies; the tumult of those that rise vp against thee increaseth continually. Psal. 74.22.74.7.8.83.12. Ios. 7.8.
O Lord though our iniquities testifie a∣inst vs, doe thou it for thy names sake;  our backslidings are many, we haue sin∣ed against thee. (Ier. 14.7,) Yet doe not horre vs for thy names sake, doe not dis∣race the throne of thy glory. (Ier. 14.21.) et thy worke appeare vnto thy seruants, d thy glory vnto their children. (Psal 90.6.) Let our mouthes bee filled with thy aise, and with thy honour all the day. Psal. 71 8.) That men may know that thou hose name alone is Iehovah, art the most igh, over all the earth. Psal. 83.18.106.7.22.25.79.13.9.13.43.4.22.22.74. , Deut. 9.26. Bring our soules out of prison that wee ay praise thy name; the righteous shall mpasse vs about, because thou hast dealt untifully with vs. (Psal. 142.7.) And  men shall feare, and declare the workes f God; for they shall wisely consider thy oings. The righteous shall bee glad in he LORD, and shall trust in thee; all the vpright in heart shall glory. (Psal. 64..) Let not them that waite on thee O
Lord GOD of hosts be ashamed for ou sakes; let not those that seeke thee be co¦founded, for our sakes O God of ISRA¦EL. Because for thy sake wee haue born reproch; shame hath couered our faces Psl. 69.6. Ah Lord God behold thou hast made th heauen & the earth by thy great power, an stretched out arme, and there is nothing t hard for thee. Thou shewest louing kind¦nesse vnto thousands, &c. the great, th mightie God, the Lord of hosts is his name great in counsell, and mighty in worke (Ier. 32.17.) And is thy hand shortned, that it cannot helpe? or is thy eare heauy that thou canst not heare? (Isa. 59.1.) Thou O Lord remainest for euer, thy throne is from generation to generation; Where∣fore doest thou forget vs for euer, and for∣sakest vs so long time. (Lm. 5.19.) why shouldest thou be as a man astonished? As a mighty man that cannot saue? (Ier. 14.9.) For thou art the God of our strength, why doest thou cast vs off? Why goe wee mour∣ning because of the oppressions of the Ene∣mie? Psal. 43.2.
Our Fathers trusted in thee, they tru∣ed, and thou diddest deliuer them they yed vnto thee, and were deliuered;  trusted in thee, and were not con∣unded. But I am a worme, and no n, a reproach of men, and despised f the people, (Psal. 22.4) Thou hast also rought thy people out of the land of AE∣GYPT, with a mighty hand, and hast got∣n thee renowne, (Dan. 9.15.) Lord where e thy former louing kindnesses, which thou diddest sweare vnto DAVID in truth? (Psal. 89.49.) Thou diddest make me hope when I was vpon my mothers breasts; I was st vpon thee from the wombe, thou art y GOD from my Mothers belly: be not farre from vs, for trouble is neere, and here is none to helpe. (Ps. 22.9.71.5.) Cast vs not off in the time of old age, forsake vs not when our strength faileth. Psl. 71.9, 22.20. Isa. 33, 2. Ier. 32, 21.14▪ 8. Isa. 51, 9. 2 Chron. 20, 6, 12. Psalm. 22, 21.

reproches of all the mighty people, where∣with thine Enemies haue reproached; O Lord, wherewith they haue reproached the footsteps of thine anoynted. (Psal. 89.50.) Grant not O Lord, the desires of the wic∣ked, further not their wicked deuices least they exalt themselues. (Psal. 140.8.) And let them not reioyce over vs▪ let them not say in their heart, ah, so would we haue it; let them not say wee haue swallowed them vp. Psal. 35.24▪ 35.19 25.1.2.13.4.36, 11.86, 17. Lam. 5.1.

When the Lord bringeth backe the captivity of his people, IACOB shall reioyce, and ISRAEL shall bee glad. Psal. 14.7.43.3.83.3.86.17.40 10. But thou hast couered thy selfe with a
Cloud, that our Prayers shall not passe through: (Lam. 3 44.) Thou hast vtter∣y reiected vs, thou art very wroth against it, (Lam. 5, 22.) Awake; why sleepest thou O LORD? Arise, cast vs not off for ever: wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our afflicton, and our op∣ression? (Psa. 44; 23.) Hast thou vtter∣ly reiected Iuda? Hath thy soule loa∣thed Zion? Why hast thou smitten vs, and there is no healing for vs? We looke for peace and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble: (Ier. 14, 19. O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it bee ere thou bee quiet? Put vp thy selfe into the scabberd; rest, and be still. How can it bee quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Zion? there hath hee appointed it. Ier. 47, 6. Now therefore our GOD; the great, the mighty, and the terrible GOD, who keepest Covenant, and mercy; let not all the trouble seeme little before thee that hath come vpon vs. (Neh. 9.32.) But

When God giueth deliuerance vnto his Church, what shall become of their cruell persecutors? A. When the Lord hath performed his whole worke vpon mount Zion, and on Ierusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his high lookes: (Isa. 10.12.) They that hate thee shall be cloathed with shame, and their dwelling places shall come to nought, (Iob, 8.22.) and perish; the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of Lambes: they shall consume; into smoake shall they consume away: (Psal. 37, 20.) They that devoure thee shall be devoured; they that spoyle thee shall be spoi∣led; and they that pray vpon thee, I will giue for a pray: (Ier. 30.16.) As they haue shed the blood of Saints, and Prophets, so they shall haue blood to drinke; for they are worthy: (Reuel. 16, 6.) For the Lord will
plead the cause of his Servants, and spoile the Soule of those that spoiled them: (Prou. 22, 23.) So that the wicked shall be a ran∣some for the righteous, and the transgres∣sors for the vpright: Prou. 21, 18. Isa. 33, 1.49, 26.51.23. Numb. 24, 8. Psal. 53, 5, 7, 15.37, 13. Ioel, 2, 20.3.1, 3.19.

Therefore fret not thy selfe because of evill dooers, neyther bee thou envi∣us at the workers of iniquitie; for they shall soone bee cut downe

The ten hornes vpon the beast, which are ten Kings, which haue received no king∣dome as yet, but receiue power as Kings one houre with the beast. These haue one mind, and shall giue their power, and strength vn∣to the beast. These shall make war with the lambe, and the lambe shall overcome them; for he is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, &c. And then these ten hornes shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eate her flesh, and burne her with fire. For God shall put in their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to a∣gree, and giue their Kingdome vnto the Beast, vntill the words of God shall be ful∣filled: Reu. 17.12. &c. Q What vse is to be made of these promises? A. 1. Therefore O yee cruell persecu∣tours, What meane you that yee beate my
people to peeces and grind the faces of the poore, saith the LORD GOD of Hosts? (Isa. 3, 15.) Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme (Palm. 105, 15.) And refraine from these men, and let them alone; for your counsell, and your workes being of men, shall come to nought; but this being of God, you can not overcome it, least happily yee be found even to fight against God, (Acts, 5, 38) And let my sonnes goe, that they may serue me; and if yee wll refuse to let them goe; behold I will slay your Sonnes, even your first borne: Exod. 4, 23.

Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy name O Lord. Psal. 83, 16.
Otherwise, let them be turned backe, and brought to confusion, that devise our hurt. Let them be as Chaffe before the Wind, and let the Angell of the Lord chase them. Let their way be darke and slippery; and let the Angell of the Lord persecute them, (Psal. 35, 4.) As smoake is driven a∣way, so driue them away; as waxe melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God: (Psal. 68, 2.) Bring vpon them the day of evill, and destroy them with a double destruction, (Ier. 17.18.) For they haue eaten vp Iacob, and devow∣red him▪ and consumed him, and haue made his habitation desolate, (Ier. 10, 25.) Therefore render vnto them a recompense, O Lord, according to the worke of their hands. Giue them sorrow of heart, thy curse vnto them. Persecute, and destroy them in anger, from vnder the Heavens of the Lord, (Lam. 3, 64.) Doe vnto them, as to the Midianites, as to Scisera, as to Iabin, at the Brooke of Kison; which pe∣rished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth. Make their Nobles like O∣reb,
and like Zeeb; yea all their Princes, as Zeba, and Zalmunna; who said, let vs take to our selues the houses of God in pos∣session. O our God, make them like a wheele, as the stubble before the Wind. As the fire burneth Wood, and as the flames set the Mountaines on fire; so perse∣cute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storme. Let them be con∣founded and troubled for ever; yea let them bee put to shame, and perish: Psalm. 83, 9. Psal. 68, 1, 129, 5.40, 14. Psal. 79, 10, 35, 1, 45, 3, 68, 1. Iudges, 5, 31. Q. What are wee to doe, when our Persecutors are thus destroyed, and wee thereby delivered? A. Breake forth into ioy, and sing toge∣ther; because, the Lord hath comforted his people; because he hath redeemed Ierusa∣lem, and made bare his holy arme, in the eyes of all the Nations: (Isa, 52, 9.) And sing yee the Song of MOSES the Ser∣vant of GOD, and the song of the Lambe, saying; great and maruailous are thy
works, Lord God Almighty; iust, and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints. Who shall not feare thee O Lord, and glo∣rifie thy Name? For thou onely art holy; for all Natons shall come and wor∣ship before thee, for thy Iudgements are made manifest. Reu. 15, 3. And as the Angels of the Waters, say vnto God, thou art righteous, O Lord; which art, and wast and shalt be; because thou hast iudged thus; even so, Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy iudg∣ments▪ (R u 16, 5,) Wherefoe we giue thee thankes O Lord God Almighty; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned: Reu 11.17.) And in the day that I called vpon thee, thou saidst, feare not. O Lord, thou hast pleaded the cause of my Soule, thou hast redeemed my life: (Lam. 3, 57.) Yea, many a time haue they afflicted me from my youth; yet they haue not prevailed against me. The Plow∣ers plowed vpon my backe, and made long their furrowes. The Lord is righteous; he hath cut a sunder the Cords of the wicked.

Notwithstanding, who so pleaseth God, shall escape from her: (Eccles. 7, 26.) For Ioseph hearkened not to his lewd Mstresse, (Gen. 39.10.) Noah also was a iust man, and perfect in his generati∣on: (Gen. 6 9.) And Lot being righ∣teous, and dwelling among the wicked, in seeing, and hearing: vexed his righteous soule from day, to day, with their vnlawfull deeds: (2, Pet. 2.8,) And we know that we are of God, when yet the whole World lyeth in wickednesse▪ 1, Ioh. 5, 19. Dan. 11.32.
O the contrary, the mouth of the strange woman being a deepe Pit, he that is abhorred of the Lord, shall fall therein: (Prou. 22, 14) And the sinner shall be ta∣ken by her: (Eccl. 7, 26.) As was Herod, by the dancing of Herodias: Math, 14.6. Numb. 31, 16. Dan. 11, 32. Q. But what meanes must bee vsed, that so I be not overtaken by such intice∣ments as these? A. 1. Concerning the workes of men, by the words of his mouth, thou shalt be kept from the path of the Destroyer: (Psal. 17.4.) For when wisedome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant vnto thy Soule, discretion shall preserue thee, and vnderstanding shall keepe thee; to deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger that flattereth with her words, P. 2, 10, 2, 16. 2. Because, as he that walketh with a wise man, shall be wiser; so the Companion of fooles shall be destroyed: (Prou. 13.20.) Therefore from such turne away: (2, Tim. 3, 5.) And say, O my Soule, come not
thou in to their secret; vnto their assem∣bly mine honour bee not thou vnited: (Gen. 49.6.) But depart from mee, O yee will doers; for I will keepe the Commande∣ent of my God: (Psal. 119.115.) I will not t with vaine persons; neither will I goe  with dissemblers: Psal. 26 4. Prou. 23, 10, 24, 1, 2, 22, 24, 25. 1 Cor. 5, 9. Psal. 120.5, 6.106, 35.143, 10. Numb. 25, 1. Deut. 4, 28. Prou. 1, 10. 3 Because wee cannot altogether a∣voyd their company, but by going out of the world: (1. Cor. 5.10.) See therefore that yee walke circumspectly; not as fooles, t as wise, (Ephes. 5.15) working out our saluation with feare and trembling; &c. that yee may be blamelesse, and rmlesse, the sonnes of GOD without ebuke, in the middes of a crooked, and eruerse Nation; among whom you shine is lights in the world, holding foorth the word of Life. Phil. 2.12.15.16. Leu. 18, 3, 4. 4 Pray, Incline not my heart vnto a∣y evill thing, to practise wicked
workes, with men that worke iniquitie, and let me not eate of their dainties. Let the Righteous smite me, it shall be a kind∣nesse, and let him reproue me, it shall bee an excellent oyle, which shall not breake my head: Psal. 141.4, 5. CHAP. XXX. Of temptations by false Teachers. Ob. IF neither the tyrannie of Perse∣cutors, nor the practices of pro∣phane ones, shall vnsettie vs from our stedfastnesse, then are wee safe, and out of danger? A. But there were false Prophets also among the people, even as there shall bee false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies, euen de∣nying the Lord that bought them: (2 Pet. 2, 1.) And many of them shall come in my Name, saying; I am CHRIST, and shall deceiue many. Math. 24, 5. Act. 15.1. 1. Ioh. 4, 1.
Ob. You teatme such Seducers, who ill not sticke to say the same of you? A. This I confesse vnto thee, that af∣r the way which they call Heresie, so wor∣ip I the GOD of my Fathers; beleeving ll things, which are written in the Law nd the Prophets. Act. 24 14. Ob. Many of these being learned in the Scriptures, and as they say, groun∣ing their opinions on the same, how hould they swarne from it? A. Some of these speake lyes in Hypo∣risie, having their Consciences seared, with a hote Iron: 1 Tim. 4.2. 2 Ohers of them, God hath shut vp heir eyes, that they cannot see, and their earts that they cannot vnderstand. Isa. 4.18.6.10. 1. Cor. 1.19. Rom. 11.8. 3 The God of this world also hath blin∣ded the mindes of some of them, which be∣eeue not, least the light of the glorious Gospell of CHRIST, who is the Image of God should shine vnto them. 2. Cor. 4.3.4. . Chro. 18.21. 4 Some things in the Scriptures them∣selues,
are hard to be vnderstood, which they that are vnlearned, and vnstable, wrest vnto their owne destruction: 2 Pet. 3, 16. Q. How commeth it to passe that these broaching abroad Errour, in stead of Truth, should be so readily receiued? A. Such are deceitfull workers, trans∣forming themselues into the Apostles of CHRIST, and as the Ministers of righte∣ousnesse. (2 Cor. 11.13.15.) Who through Couetousnes, doe with fained words make marchandise of men: (2. Pet. 2.3.) And come in sheepes cloathing; though inward∣ly they are ravening Wolues: Math. 7, 15. Iude, 12. 2 They speake of the World, and there∣fore the world heareth them. Ioh. 1, 4, 5. 3 Many are laden with sinnes, and led away with divers lusts; and therefore are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, and so are led cap∣tiue by such. 2 Tim. 3, 6. Q. Why then doth God permit such dangerous Heretickes to remaine in the Church?
A. There must be heresies among you, hat they which are approved, may be made anifest among you. 1 Cor. 11, 19. Q. But are not wee also in danger to e seduced by them? A. Wee are of GOD; he that is of God beateth vs, although he that is not of God eareth vs not. Hereby we know the Spirit of Truth, and the spirit of Error: (1 Ioh. , 6.) And you also little Children being if God, haue overcome them; because grea∣ter is he that is in you than he hath is in the world: (1 Ioh. 4, 4.) Moreouer CHRIST alleih his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his ne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the sheepe follow him; for they know his voyce, and a stranger will they not follow, but will ee from him; for they know not the voyce of strangers. Ioh. 10▪ 3. And therefore such Heretickes shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be manifest vnto all men. And you for your part, haue fully knowne my Doctrine, and manner of life, &c. Onely evill
men, and seducers shall waxe worse, and worse; deceiuing, and being deceiued. 2. Tim. 3.9.13. Ob. Notwithstanding it staggereth mee not a little, to see, and heare what miracles some such haue wrought. A. I haue confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise min∣ded. (Gal. 5.10.) For who should so be∣witch you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes IESVS CHRIST hath beene evidently set forth, and Cruci∣fied among you: (G. 3 1. Kowing this that Antchrist his comming is after the working of Sathan, with all power, and signes, and lying wonders and wth all de∣ceiueablenesse, of vnrghteousnesse in them that perish. 2. Thess. 2 9. Q. How may I bee preserued from thes impostures? A. Beleeue not every Spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of GOD, (1. Ioh. 4, 1.) prouing all things, and bolding fast that which is good: (1 Thess. 5, 21.) As did the Church of Ephesus, who
tryed them, which said they were Apostles and were not, and found them lyars: Reu. , 2. 1 Cor. 14, 32. Prou. 14, 15. Isa. 8, 0. Acts, 17.11. Q. Shew vs then the markes whereby they may be knowne? A. You shall know them by their fruits: ath. 7, 16. 1 By their Entrance; For hee that ntreth not in by the doore, into the sheepe∣fold; but climbeth vp some other way, the same is a Thiefe, and a Robber; but he that treth in by the doore, is the Shepheard of the sheepe: Ioh. 10, 1, 2. 2 By their Doctrine; For heereby know yee the Spirit of GOD; every spirit hat confesseth that IESVS CHRIST is ome in the Flesh, is of God. And every spirit that confesseth not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God, and this is that Spirit of Antichrist, whereof you haue heard▪ that it should come, and e∣en now is already in the World: 1 Ioh. 4, 2.1, 2, 22, 23. 3 By their opposing of faithfull Mi∣nisters;
For as IANNES, and IAMBRES withstood MOSES, so doe these also resist, the truth; men of corrupt minds, repro∣bate concerning the Faith. 2 Tim. 3.8. 4 By their euill liues; vngodly men they are, turning the grace of God into wantonnesse, and doe defile the flesh. Iude, 4, 8. 5 If thou say in thine heart, how shall wee know the Word which the LORD hath not spoken? When a Prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing fol∣low not, nor come to passe, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously. Deut. 18.21. Ob. Some of these men haue fore∣told vs of things, which haue come to passe? A. If there arise among you a Prophet, or dreamer of dreames, and giueth thee a signe, or wonder; and the signe, or the won∣der come to passe, wherof he spake vnto thee, saying, let vs goe after other Gods, which thou hast not knowne, and let vs serue
thē, thou shalt not harken vnto the words of that Prophet, or that dreamer, of dreames: for the Lord your God prooveth you, to know whether you loue the Lord your God wth all your heart, and with all your soule: Deut. 13.1. Therefore to the Law, and to the testi∣monie, if they speake not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them: Isa. 8, 20. Q. What is the danger that such Heretiques doe expose themselues vnto? A. As they haue sowne the wind, so they shall reape the whirlewind: (Hos. 8, 7) For they being before ordained to condem∣nation: (Iud. 4.) Their iudgement now a long time lingereth not, and their damna∣tion slumbereth not, 2, Pet. 2, 3, Gal. 5, 10. Reuel. 22, 18. Mat. 23, 5. Ier. 28, 16.17. ver. 29, 31, 32. Q. These Heretiques being a people so dangerous, what may thence bee learned? A. Ye therefore beloved, seeing ye know
these things before, beware least you also; being led away with the errors of the wic∣ked, fall from your owne stedfaslnes, (2, Pet. 3, 17.) And be taken in a snare after them: (Deu. 12, 30.) By beeing carried about with divers, and strange Doctrines: for it is a good thing, that the heart be established with grace; but not with meats, which haue not profited them that haue beene exercised in them: (Heb. 13, 9.) But hath occasio∣nd them to erre concerning the faith: 1. Tim. 6, 20. 1, Cor. 3, 11. 1, Ioh. 5, 21. Prou. 19, 27, 30, 6. 2, Tim. 2, 1, 2, 2.1, 13, 14. Col. 2, 6. Math. 24, 26. Q What doe you account Heresie? Is every little swaruing from the truth damnable? A. If any man buildeth vpon (Christ) the foundation: gold silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every mans worke shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it; because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every mans worke of what sort it is. If any mans worke abide, which he
hath built therevpon, he shall receiue a re∣ward. If any mans worke shall he burnt, he shall suffer losse; but he himselfe shall be sa∣ve; yet so, as by fire: 1, Cor. 3.12. Gal. 5.9. Q. You haue then said enough for my setling; but because the time will come, when other men will not endure sound do∣ctrine; but after their owne lusts shall heape to themselues Teachers, hauing it∣ching eares, and shall turne away theyr eares from the truth, and shall be turned to Fables: When these things come to passe, what am I to doe? 2. Tim. 4, 3. A. Say vnto such a one, I marvaile that you are so soone removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, vn∣to another Gospell▪ which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospell of Christ. But though we, or an Angell from Heaven preach any other Gospell vnto you, than that which we haue preached, let him be accursed:  1, 6.
Q. What if such a one shall yet not onely persist in his errour himselfe, but shall seeke to pervert others also? A. Then set thine eyes vpon him, and say, O full of all subtilty, and all mischiefe, thou child of the Divell, thou enemy of all righteousnes, wilt thou not cease to per∣vert the right wayes of the Lord? Now therefore the hand of the Lord shall be vp∣on thee: Act. 13.9 Q. What if hee shall yet continue to despise my admonitions, and these fearefull menaces of Iudgement? A. A man that is an Heretike, after the first, & second admonition reiect, knowing that het is such, is subverted, and sinneth being condemned of himselfe: (Tit. 3▪ 10.) And if such a one come vnto you, receiue him not to house, neither bid him God speed, (Iob. 2. Epist, 10.) But he shall be slaine, because hee hath spoken, to turne you away from the Lord your GOD, to thrust thee out of the way, wherein the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to walke; so shalt thou take the euill away forth of the
middest of thee: Deutrinom. 13, 5, 27, 18, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20.7. 2. Hos. 8, 7. Iosh. 23, 12. Ob. Though I haue not procee∣ded against such Heretiques, after this manner; yet haue I kept my selfe found in the faith? A. Notwithstanding I haue a few things against thee, because thou suffe∣rest, that woman Iezabel, which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, to teach, and to se∣duce my Servants, to commit fornication, and to eate things sacrificed vnto Idols: Reu. 2, 20. Ob. Shall I in this my neglect of dutie, bee as sorely punished, as they in these their damnable Here∣sies? A. N, for behold I will cast her into a Bed and them that commit Adultery with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds, &c. But vnto you I say, and vnto the rest of them of Thiatira; as many as haue not this do∣ctrine, and which haue not knowne
the depths of Sathan; as they speake, I will put vpon you none other burthen: Reu. 2, 22. CHAP. XXXI. Of Temptations by Prosperity. Q. I Doe now see there is much dan∣ger to bee feared from earthly men, but is the like danger to be expected from earthly things? A. Yea; for Vzziah, when he was strong, his heart was lifted vp to his de∣struction: (2. Chron. 26.16.) And the Is∣raelites assembled themselues, for Corne, and Wine, and they rebelled against the Lord: (Hos. 7, 14.) For because they did ride on the high places of the earth; did eate the increase of the fields and did suck the hony out of the Rocke; & oyle cut of the flinty Rocke; butter of Kine, and milke of Sheep, with fat of Lambs▪ &c. Therfore le∣surum waxed fat, grew thick, was covered
with fatnesse, &c. Then he forsooke God which made him, and lightly esteemed the rocke of his Salvation. Of the Roe that begat them they were vnmindfull, and did forget him that formed them: (Deut. 32, 13.) Wherby it appeares to be more easier for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: Math. 19, 24. Isa. 26, 10. Hosea, 4, 7, 4, 11, 10, 1.13, 6. Daniel, 5, 4. Iob. 21, 14, 21, 7. Iam, 2, 6. Prou. 23, 29. Eccl. 3, 11. Ob. Who then can bee saved? Math. 19 25. A. With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible: (Math. 19, 26.) For by faith Moses when he was come to yeeres, refused to be called the Sonne of Pharoahs daughter; chusing rather to suffer affliction, with the people of God, than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season; esteeming the reproaches of Christ greater riches, than the treasures of Ae∣gypt: Heb. 11, 24.
For the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, though the heart of the foole is in the house of mirth: Eccl. 7, 4. Isa. 32, 5. Gen. 24.35.22, 12. Iob. 1, 1. Dan. 1 12. Q. Because of this, and such like ex∣amples, are we altogether to be without feare, in the inioyment of earthly things? A. When thou hast eaten, and art full, beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his Commandements, and his iudgements: (Dut. 8, 10.) For which en, remember Lots wife: Luk. 17, 32. Gen. 19.26, Deut. 6, 10, 11. Q. How may wee then bee preserved from the danger of earthly things? A. 1. Loue not the world, neither the things that are in the world: (1, Ioh, 2, 15.) For wilt thou set thine eyes vpon that which is not? Prou. 23, 5. 2. Vse this world as if you vsed it not, (1. Cor. 7, 31.) For no mā that warreth, intan∣gleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, that hee may please him, who hath chosen him to bee a Souldier: &c.
2 Tim. 2, 4. Iam. 1.10, 11. Cant. 2, 10. Gal. 6, 14. Prou. 23, 1, 2, 3. 3 Pray, saying; Turne away mine eyes om beholding vanity, and quicken thou t in thy way: (Psal. 119, 37.) Two things ue I required of thee, deny me them ut before I dye, remoue farre from me va∣itie and lyes; giue mee neither Povertie r Riches, feed me with food convenient for mee; least I be full and deny thee, and y, Who is the Lord? Or least I be poore nd steale, and take the name of my God in aine. Prou. 30, 7. Q. What further incouragement can ou giue me to stand out against these o many Temptations, of the Flesh, the Deuill, and the World? A. He that indureth to the end shall it saved: (Math. 10 22.) And to him that overcommeth will I giue to eate of the ree of Life, which is in the middes of the Paradise of GOD: (Reuel. 2, 7.) And to te of the hidden Manna, and I will giue im a white stone, and in the stone, a new ame written, which no man knoweth sa∣ving
hee that receiueth it: (Reuel 2, 17.) He shall (also) bee cloathed in white ray∣ment, and I will not blot out his Name out of the booke of Life; but I will confesse his name before my Father, and before his Angels. (Reu. 3.5.) And will grant him to sit with mee in my Throne, e∣ven as I also overcame, and am set downe with my Father in his throne: Reuel. 3.21, 3▪ 12.21.7. Luk. 22.28.29.30 verses. Q. What should this so rich and plentifull a reward moone vs vnto? A. To walke circumspectly not as fooles, but as wise: (Ephes. 5.15.) And to ponder the pathes of thy feete, that thy wayes may be establshed, and turne not to the right hand nor to the left, but remooue thy foot from evill: Prou. 4, 26, 27. 2. Pray that you fall not into temptati∣on: (Math. 26, 41.) But that hee would grant vnto vs, that wee being deliuered out of the hands of our enemies, might serue him without feare, in holinesse, and
righteousnesse, before him, all the dayes of r life. Luk. 1.74. CHAP. XXXII. Of the Word of GOD. IN the middes of so many Temp∣tations on the right hand, and on e left, what one meanes of vpholding th GOD left vnto his Church? A. When all Israel is come to appeare fore the Lord thy GOD, in the place here hee shall chuse, thou shalt reade this w before all Israel, in their hearing. oth of Men, and Women, and Chil∣n, and thy Stranger that is within y Gates; that they may heare, and that y may learne, and feare the Lord your OD, and obserue to doe all the words  this Law; and that their Children hich haue not knowne any thing, may re, and learne to feare the LORD r GOD, as long as yee liue: (Deut. , 11. Exod. 24, 7. Ios. 8, 34, 35.
Q. Why? what excellencie is there in this law of GOD, more than in other writings of men, whereby to worke such a feare of God in our hearts? A. The law of the Lord is perfect, con∣verting the Soule; the of testmony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord are right, reioycing the heart; the Commandement of the Lord is pure, inlightening the eyes: (Psal. 19, 7.) Not comming vnto you in Word on∣ly, but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance: (1 Thess. 1, 5.) Being able to make thee wise vnto Salvati∣on, through Faith, which is in Christ Iesus; and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproofe, for correction for instruction in Righteous∣nes, that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furnished vnto all good workes: (2 Tim. 3, 15.) For as the raine commeth downe, and the snow from Heaven, and re∣turneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring foorth, and bud, that it may giue seed to the Sower, and Bread to the eater; so shall my
Word bee that goeth forth out of my outh; it shall not returne to me voyd; t it shall accomplish that which I ease, and it shall prosper in the thing hereto I send it: Deut. 32, 2. Isa. 55, 10. 9, 2. Iob, 6, 25. Eccles. 12, 11. Act. 26, 8. Heb. 4, 12. Rom. 10, 17. Thus the Churches were by the Word, established in the Faith: (Acts, 16, 5.) And I am sure also, that when I come vnto you, I shall come in the fulnesse of the blessing of the Gospell of CHRIST: Rom. 15, 29. Col. 1, 6. Acts, 4, 4.18, 8. 17, 11, 12, 34. verses, 12, 24, 17, 4, 15, 32, 8. 12, 24, 25. Ioh. 15, 3. Q. Whence hath the Scripture this power, and efficacie? A. Thus saith the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy One of Israel; I am the Lord thy GOD, which teach thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest goe: (Isa. 48, 7.) I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to him that is farre off, and to him that is neere: (Isa. 57, 19.) It is written in the Prophets,
and they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth vnto me. Ioh. 6, 45. Who then is PAVL? And who is A∣POLLO? But the Ministers by whom yee beleeved; even as the Lord gaue to euery man. I haue planted, APOLLO watered, but GOD gaue the increase▪ So then neither is hee that planteth any thing, neither hee that watereth, but God that giueth the increase: (1. Cor. 3, 5.) So that your Faith standeth not in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit wee speake wisedome, a∣mong them that are perfect; yet not the wisedome of this World, nor of the Princes of this world, that commeth to nought; but we speake the wisedome of God in a myste∣rie; even the hidden wisedome, which God ordayned before the World, vnto our glory.  Cor. 2, 4.) Whereunto I also labour, iving according to his working, which  th in me mightily: (Col. 1, 29.) For  use also thanke wee God without cea∣ cause when ye received the Word of
God, which yee heard of vs, yee received it, ut as the word of men; but as it is in truth e word of God; which effectually also wor∣th in you that beleeue: (1 Thess. 2, 13.) lessed therefore art thou Simon Bar-lo∣, for flesh, and blood, hath not revealed  vnto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven: Mat. 16, 17. Mark. 17 20. 2. Tim. , 16. 1 Cor. 1, 18. Act. 15, 17.10, 44. Gal. 2, , 1.11, 12. Mcha, 3, 8. Q. But is euery part of the Word, for he working of grace, of like efficacie? A. This onely would I learne of you; re∣ceived you the Spirit, by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? (Gal. 3, .) For which cause I am not ashamed of he Gospell of CHRIST; for that is the ower of God vnto Salvation, to every one that beleeueth: (Rom. 1, 16.) For if the ministration of death; written, and ingra∣n in stones was glorious; so that the chil∣dren of Israel could not stedfastly behold th face of MOSES, for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to bee done way: how shall not that ministration
of the Spirit, bee rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation bee glo∣ry, much more doth the ministration of Righteousnesse exeeed in glory. For even that which was made glorious, had no glo∣ry, in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which was done a∣way was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious: 2. Cor. 3.7.1.1.21. Q. What in lieu of this Word doth God require of vs? A. Because he hath shewed his word vn∣to Iacob, and his Statutes, and his iudge∣ments vnto Israel; and hath not dealt so with every Nation; and for his iudgments they haue not knowne them, therfore praise ye the Lord: Psal. 147.19. Q. Why? doe all such as haue the Word, reape benefit thereby? A. No; for GOD shall smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips hee shall slay the wic∣ked: (Ia. 11.4.) And we are vnto God a sweet savour of CHRIST; in them that
are saved, and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death vnto death, and to the other, the savou of lfe vnto life: 2, Cor. 2.15. Q. Hath the word one and the same entertainement among all them that pe∣rish? A. No; for when PAVL disputed of Righteousnesse, and Temperance, and of the Iudgment to come, Faelix trembled: Acts, 24, 25. 2 Herod he heard Iohn gladly, and did many things: (Mark. 6, 20.) Vnto others the Word of the Lord is a reproach; they haue no delight in it: Ier. 6.10. 3 The Princes and people of Israel, when they heard the Word of the Lord, let their Servants goe free, but afterwards repented: Ier. 34, 10, 11. 4 When IEREMIAH preached the Word of the Lord, to the Iewes that went downe into Aegypt, to soiourne there, they would not at all hearken to him: (Ier. 44, 16.) And from the prea∣ching of Zachariah, they pulled away the
shoulder, and stopped their eares, that they should not heare; yea they made their harts as an Adamant stone, least they should heare the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his spi∣rit, by the ministery of the Prophets: Zach. 7, 11. Ier. 6, 16.44, 3.4.32.23. 2, Chron. 24, 19, 2, 33, 10. Hos. 7, 1. Ezek. 33, 30. 5 Ohers mocking said; these men are full of new wine: (Act, 2.13.) And with their mouthes make Iests: Ezek. 33.31. Ier. 20.7, 8, 9. Acts. 17, 32, 17, 18.2, Chron. 36, 16. 6 And the multitude of the Iewes, when they heard PAVL, cryed, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should liue; and as they cryed out, they cast off their cloathes, and threw dust in the Ayre. (Acts 22, 22.) And when PAVL sent into Macedonia, Timothius and Erastus, there arose no small stir also about that way, (Acts 19, 22) And when the Iewes heard Steven they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed
on him with their teeth, Acts, 7.54. 7 Others make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that re∣prooveth in the Gate, and turne aside the iust for a thing of nought: Isa. 29, 21. Mat. 10.34. Q. What are the reasons of so much prophane, and vnprofitable hearing of the Word? A. Some it profiteth not; because it is not mixed with faith, in them that heare it: Heb. 4, 2. Acts 28, 24 19.9. 2 Herod would not part with Hero∣dias, and therefore IOHN touching him vpon that sinne, he cast him into prison: (Mark. 6, 17.) And so every man that e∣vill doeth, hateth the light; neyther com∣meth to the light, least his deeds should bee reprooved: Ioh. 3, 20. Ezek. 33, 31. 3 They are but naturall, not having the spirit: (Iud. 19.) And the naturall man perceiveth not the things of the spirit of God; because they are spiritually discerned. 1, Cor. 2, 14.1, Cor. 2, 11.1, 2, 6, 7.8. Hos. 8.12. Ier. 6, 10. Act. 17, 20. Math. 11, 27, 13.11, 11, 25, 26.
4 God hath given them the Spirit of slumber; eyes that they should not see, and eares that they should not heare vnto this day: (Rom. 11.8.) For it is written I will destroy the wsedome of the wise, and will cast away the vnderstanding of the pru∣dent▪ saith the LORD 1, Cor. 1 19. Isa. 6, 10 44.18. 5 If our Gospell be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whom the God of this world, hath blinded the minds of them that be∣leeue not; that the light of the glorious Gos∣pell of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them: 2, Corinth. 4, . 6 Some are hindred by the pride of theyr outward greatnesse, and therefore not the rich, but the poore receiue the Gos∣pell: (Mt 11.5) For saith Amazia vnto Amos, O thou Seer, goe flee thee away in∣to the Land of Iudah, and there eate bread, and Prophesie there. But Prophesie not a∣gaine any more at Bethel: for it is the Kings Chappell, and it is the Kings Court: Amos, 7, 12.
7 Others thinke they are rich, and in∣creased with goods, and haue need of no∣thing; not knowing how they are wretched, and miserable, and poore, and blind, and naked: (Reu. 3 17.) And therefore being full, they despise the hony Combe; Where∣as to the hungry Soule, every bitter thing is sweet: Prou. 27, 7. Ioh. 9, 39▪ 1, Cor. 1, 19. Q. What are the dangers which doe atend the contempt, and abuse of the Word? 1. A Famine; not of Bread, but of hea∣ring the Word of the Lord: (Amos, 8, 11, 12.) For which cause Paul, and Barnabas turned from the Iewes, vnto the Gentiles: Acts, 13, 46.18.6, 16, 6. Ioh. 12, 35. 1, Sam. 28, 6. 2, Chron. 5, 3. Ezek. 7, 26. Amos, 8, 9. 2. Vnrecoverable destction. Because saith God, I haue called and yee haue re∣fused, I haue stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but you haue set at naught all my Counsell, and would none of my reproofe; I also will laugh at your
calamitie, and I will mocke when your feare commeth: (Prou. 1, 24.) And then as I cryed, and you would not heare; so you shall cry, and I will not heare: (Ier, 11, 11.) But I will doe vnto you as I haue done to Shiloh; and I will cast you out, as I haue cast out all your Bre∣thren; even the whole seed of Ephra∣im: Io. 7.13. &c. For the Earth which drinketh in the Raine that commeth oft vpon it, and yet beareth thornes, and briars, is reiected and is nigh vnto cursing, whose end is to be burned: Heb. 6.7, 10, 28. Hos. 6.5. Deut. 17, 12. Revel. 2, 16. Math. 12, 41. 2, Chron. 36, 14, &c. Ierom. 11, 6. Nehem. 9, 29. Ezek. 34, 13, 33, 33. Prou. 13.13 Q. What vse are wee to make of all this? A. Therefore suffer the words of ex∣hortation: (Heb. 13, 22.) And heare what the spirit saith to the Churches▪ (Reu. 3, 13) That so the word of God may dwell in you plenteously in all wisdome, (Col. 3, 16)
For why should their bee a price put into the hand of a Foole to get wisedome, and he hath no heart? (Prou. 17, 16.) Re∣ceiue my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold; for wisedome is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired, are not to bee compared to it: (Prou, 8, 10.) Therefore buy the truth, and sell it not; also wise∣dome, and instruction, and vnderstanding: (Prou. 23, 23.) Incline your eare, and come vnto me: heare and your soule shall liue: Isa. 55, 3. 1, Thess. 5, 20. Heb. 12, 25. Prou. 8, 33, 16, 16.1, 20, 22, 23, 8, 12, 9. 1, Iam. 1, 21. Iob. 22, 22. 2, Cor. 6, 11.

And with what measure you mete, it shall bee measured to you: Mark. 4, 24. Q. Tell vs therefore how wee may heare the Word with fruit?
A. 1. Hare it diligenly. my Sonne if thou wilt receiue my words and hide my Commandements with thee; so that thou wilt incline thine eare vnto wisedome, and apply thine heart vnto vnderstanding; yea if thou cryest after knowledge & liftest vp thy voyce for vnderstanding: If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her, as for hid treasures: then shalt thou vn∣derstand the feare of the LORD, and find the knowledge of GOD: Prou. 2, 1, 1, 5, 6. 2 Lay aside all malice, and guile and Hy∣pocrisies, and enuies, & evil-speakings: (1. Pet. 2; 1.) And all filthines, and superfluitie of naughtines Iam. 1, 21.) And breake vp your fallow ground, and sow not among thornes. Circumcise your selues to the Lord, and take away the fore skins of your harts: Ier. 4.3 4. 3 As new borne babes desire the sin∣cere milke of the Word, that you may grow thereby: (1. Pet. 2.2.) For wheresoever the Carcase is, thither will the Eagles resort: Math. 24.28.
4 Receiue with meeknesse the ingrafted ord, which is able to saue your Soules: (. Iam. 21.) And let no man deceiue mselfe; for if any man among you would  wise in this World, let him become a oole that hee may be wise: (1. Cor. 3, 18.) For IESVS said, For Iudgement I am me into this World, that they which see ut, might see, and they which see might  made blind, Ioh. 9 39. Math. 11.25 26.5 Pray saying; 1. Open thou mine eyes, that may behold the wondrous things of thy w. I am a stranger on earth; hide not thy mmandements from me. (Psal. 119.18.) will praise thee with vprightnesse of heart hen I shall haue learned thy righteous dgements. Psal. 119.7.27 33, 34 73.125.69.171. verses. 2 Pray, O that my wayes were directed  keepe thy statutes, then shall I not be asha∣d, when I haue respect vnto all thy com∣andements, (Psal. 1 9.5.) with my whole art haue I sought thee, O let me not wan∣r from thy commandements, (119.10.) eale bountifully with thy seruant, that I
may liue, and keepe thy word, (119.17.) Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed, (119, 80.) Order my steps in thy word, and let not any iniquity haue dominion over me: 119.133. 6 Be yee dooers of the word, and not hea∣rers onely, deceiuing your owne soules. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not  dooer; he is like vnto a man, beholding hi naturall face in a glasse; for he beholdet himselfe, and goeth his way, and strait wa forgetteth what manner of man hee wa But who so looketh into the perfect law o liberty, and continueth therein; he no being a forgetfull hearer, but a dooer of th worke, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

I haue done my poore indea∣uour to obserue these rules, yet when I am present at the word, I cannot keepe my mind from wandring. A. The eares of them that heare, shall
hearken. (Isa. 32.3.) And the eares of the deafe shall be opened, (Isa. 35.5.) For hee akeneth morning, by morning, he will wa∣ken thine eare, to heare, as the learned, (Isa. 50.4.) Or as he opened the heart of LID∣DEA, whereby she attended vnto the things which were spoken by PAVL, (Act. 16.14.) Whereby thou shalt bee able to say, eake LORD, for thy seruant heareth. . Sam. 3.9. Neh. 8.3. Act. 8.6. Luk. 19.8. Ob. The Scripture is a booke so fast sealed, and I my selfe, am a man so dull of conceit, that I cannot vnderstand the me. Isa. 28.9. &c. A. The entrance in to GODS word giueth light; it giueth vnderstan∣ding to the simple. (Psal. 119, 130.) Wher∣by they that erre in spirit, shall come to vnderstanding, and they that murmur hall learne Doctrine. (Isa. 29.24.) The people that walke in darkenesse, haue ene a great light, and they that well in the land of the shadow of death, pon them hath the light shined, (Isa. 9.2.)
For God who commanded the light to shine out of darknesse, hath shined in your hearts; to giue the light of the knowledge of God, in the face of IESVS CHRIST. 2 Cor. 4 6. I haue (indeed) spoken vnto you in Proverbes, but the time commeth, when I shall no more speake to you in proverbes, but I shall shw you plainely of the Father: (Ioh. 16, 25.) In that day, shall the deafe heare the words of this Booke, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscuritie, and out of darknesse: Isa. 29, 18, 35, 5, 32, 2 50 4.

Now therefore thankes bee vnto God, which alwayes maketh manifest, the sauour of his Knowledge by vs in every place: (2 Cor. 2.14.) For there is Gold, and a multitude of precious Stones; but the lips of Knowledge are a precious iewell: Prou. 20.15. Neh. 8.12. Math. 11.25. Ob. But I am so hard-hearted, that I can not be affected with the Word?
A. I will put a new Spirit within you, and I will take the stony heart out of thy flesh, and I will giue thee an heart of Flesh: (Ezek. 11.19) As well as to the Iews who wept when they heard the words of the Law; (Neb. 8.9.) For is not my Word lke a fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer, that breaketh the Rockes in pieces? Ier. 23, 29.26.18. Ioh. 5.25. Act. 2.37, 16.29. 2 His wordes were found; and I did eate them, and they were vnto me, the ioy and reioycing of my heart: (Ier. 15, 16.) I will therefore delight my selfe in his Sta∣tutes: (Psal. 119.16.) How sweet is his Word vnto my taste? Yea sweeter then ho∣ney to my mouth: (Psal. 119.103.) There∣fore my Sonne eate thou honey, because it is good, and the honey combe, which is sweet to thy tast. So shall the knowledge of wise∣dome be vnto thy soule, when thou hast found it: Prou. 24.13. Act. 15.31.13.48. Iob, 23.12. Act. 2.41. Psal. 119.16.17.111.174.162. verses. Luk. 24.32. Ob. I am no sooner gone from the Word, but all is forgotten?
A. The Comforter which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name; he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoeuer I haue said vnto you. (Ioh. 14.26.) Wherby MARY kept all those things in her heart, which were told her by the Shepheards. (Luk. 2.19.) Neither did I forget Gods word. Psal. 119.16. 2. Pet. 1.12.13. Ob. The hardest taske is yet behind, to wit; to put in practise what we heare? A. I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will leade them in the pathes that they haue not knowne; I will make darknesse light before them, and croc∣ked things straight, saith the LORD. (Isa. 42.16.) Who hath opened mine eares and I was not rebellious, neither tur∣ned away backward, (Isa. 50.5.) Yea I haue refrained my feet from every evill way, that I might keepe his word, (Psalm. 119.101.) So that when hee said seeke yee my face, my heart said vnto him, thy face LORD will I seeke: (Psal. 27.8.)
For this is the loue of GOD that we keepe  Commandements, and his comman∣dements are not grievous: 1 Ioh. 5, 3. Hag. 1, 12. Psalm. 119, 15, 48, 57, 104,  68. Math. 13, 8.23. Col. 1, 6. Luk. 1.5, , 2. Chron. 17, 6. CHAP. XXXIII. Of Ministers. Ob. YOu tell me of the Word, and the great benefit thereof; but how ould I either know, or doe what the Word teacheth, without a guide? Act. , 31. A. When CHRIST ascended vp on high he gaue guifts vnto men, &c. and he gaue some Apostles, and some Prophets, nd some Euangelists, and some Pastors, and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the Ministerie, for he edifying of the Body of CHRIST;
till we all eome in the vnity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, vnto a perfect man, vnto the measure of the sta∣ture, of the fulnesse of Christ: (Eph. 4.8.11.) And therefore though the LORD giue you the bread of Adversitie, and the water of Affliction, yet thy Teachers shall not be removed into a corner any more; but thine eyes shall see thy Teachers: (Isa. 30.20.) For the Lord giveth the Word, great is the company of Preachers: Psal. 68.11. Ier. 33.18. Leuit. 10, 11. Isa. 41.27. Isa 62.6. Q. But shall wee haue such Pastors, as will deale faithfully with vs? A. I will giue you Pastors according to mine owne heart; which shall feed you, with knowledge, and vnderstanding: (Ier. 3, 15.) Who will very gladly spend, and bee spent for you: (2. Cor. 12.15.) As Moses who was faithfull in all his house: (Heb. 3.5.) And as of Leui it was said the Law of truth is in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips; he walked with me in peace, and equitie: and did turne
away many from iniquitie: Mal. 2, 6. Moreover yee know from the first day, that Paul came into Asia, after what man∣ner he hath beene with you, at all seasons: serving the Lord with all humblenesse of mind, and with many teares, and tempta∣tions: which befell him, by the lying in wait of the Iewes: and how he kept backe nothing, that was profitable vnto you: (Act, 20.18.) And you know the proofe of Timothie; that as a Sonne with the Father he hath served with Paul in the Gospell: (Phil. 2 22.) And for the worke of Christ, he was nigh vnto death; not regarding his life: (Phil. 2, 30.) And day∣ly in the Temple, and in every house, the Disciples ceased not to teach, and to preach IESVS CHRIST: (Acts, 5, 42.) These are not as many, which corrupt the Word of God; but as of sincerity; but as of God, in the sight of God, speake they in Christ: 2, Cor. 2, 17▪ 11, 23, 1, 9, 27, 1, 9.19.2, Chron 17▪ 9, 8, 13.

8, 21, 9, 1, 3, 17. Ezra. 7, 6, 10. 1. Sam. 3, 21. Q. Wherefore are these promises recorded in Gods word, concerning his Ministers? A. 1. That they may be apt to teach: (1, Tim. 3.2.) And therefore giue atten∣dance vnto reading: (1. Tim. 4 1) And stu∣dy to shew hēselues workmen that need not to be ashamed: dividing the Word of truth aright: (2, Tim. 2, 5.) For every Scribe taught vnto the Kingdome of Heaven: is like vnto a man, that is a housholder: which bringeth forth out of his treasurie, things both new, an old: Math. 13, 52. 2 That they be diligent, to know the state of their flockes, and to looke well to their heards: (Prou. 27, 23.) Taking the oversight thereof: (1, Pet. 5, 2.) For they are set for a defence, and fortresse among the people: that they may know, and try their wayes: Ier. 6, 27. 3 That they feed the flocke of GOD, which is among you: (1, Pet. 5, 2.) And preach the word, and be instant; in season,
and out of season: to reprooue, rebuke, ex∣hort, with all long suffering, and doctrine: (2, Tim. 4, 2,) Not shunning to declare the whole Councell of God: (Acts, 20.27) But to cry aloud; and lift vp their voice lke a Trumpet; to shew my people their transgres∣sion, and the house of Iacob their sinnes: (Isa. 58, 1.) And in the Spirit, and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the Fathers to the Children: and the disobedient, to the wisedome of the iust; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord: (Luk. 1, 17.) Exhorting them that with full purpose of heart, they would cleaue vnto the Lord: (Act, 11.23.) Exorting the elder women as mothers: the younger women, as sisters, with all purity: 1, Tm. 5, 2. Wherein if any man speake, let him speake as the Oracles of GOD: (1, Pet. 4, 11,) The Prophet that hath a Dreame, let him tell a Dreame; and hee that hath my Word, let him speake my Word faithfully; what is the Chaffe to the Wheate, saith the LORD?

Giving no offence in any thing, that their Ministrie be not blamed; but in all things approving themselues as the Ministers of God: (2, Cor. 6, 3.) Perfor∣ming the same not by constraint, but wil∣lingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind: 1, Pet. 5, 2. 1, Timoth. 3, 1. Math. 23, 8. Q How doth GOD taxe the neg∣ligence of his Priests vnder the Law? A. I haue seene (saith GOD) foolish∣nesse in the Prophets of Samaria; that pro∣phesie in Baal▪ and caused my people Is∣rael to erre. I haue seene also in the Pro∣phets of Ierusalem, filthinesse; they com∣mit adultery, and walke in lies; they strengthen also the hands of the wicked, that none can returne from his wickednes: (Ier. 23, 13.) They prophesie lyes in my name, saying; I haue dreamed, I haue
dreamed; yea they are Prophets of the de∣ceit of their owne heart: (Ier. 23 25.) They haue healed also, the hurt of the Daughter of my people slightly saying; Peace, peace: when there is no peace: (Ier. 6, 19.) Others they bite with the teeth, and he that putteth not into their mouthes, they even prepare warre against him: Mich. 3, 5, 1. Some of them also are blind▪ they are ignorant, they are dumbe Dogs, they can∣not barke; sleeping, lying downe, loving to slumber: yea they are greedy Dogs, which can never haue enough: and they are Shep∣heards, that cannot vnderstand, they all looke to their owne way, every one for his gaine, from his quarter: (Isa. 56, 10.) All these shut vp the Kingdome of Hea∣ven against men: for they neither goe in themselues, neither suffer them that are entring in, to goe in: Math: 23, 13. Ierem. 10, 21, 8 11. 23, 16, 17, 5, 30, 31. Ezek. 13, 6, 7. Zephan. 3, 4. Mal. 2, 9. Q. How doth GOD threaten
such Priests vnder the Law? A. Ta their way should bee vn∣to them as slippery wayes in the darknesse; and ha they should bee driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evill vpon them; even the yeare of their visitation, saith the Lord? (Ier. 23, 12.) And I will require my Flocke at their hands: (Ezek. 34.10.) And mine hand shall be vp∣on the Prophets, that see vanity, and di∣vine lyes: they shall not be in the Assem∣bly of my people, neyther shall they bee written in the writing of the House of Israel: (Ezek. 13, 9.) And they shall beare their punishment; the punishment of the Prophet, shall be, even as the punish∣ment of him that asketh: (Ezekiel, 14, 10.) And because they make many to stumble at the Law, and haue corrupted the Covenant of eui; therefore will I make them contemptible, and base before all the people: (Mal. 2, 8) Night shall bee vnto them, that they shall not haue a Vision; and it shall be darke vnto them, and they shall not dvine, and the Sunne
shall goe downe over the Prophets, and the day shall bee darke over them. Then shall they bee ashamed, and confounded; yea they shall cover their lips; for there is no answere from GOD: Mich. 3, 6. Ob. But are not Gods Ministers, even now vnder the Gospell, discouraged by theyr people, and flickr, for theyr dead∣nesse, and dulnesse, in their workes of piety and devotio? Sonne of man, I haue made them Watchmen to the house of Israel; there∣fore they should haue heard the Word at my mouth, and haue given them war∣ning from mee. So that when I haue said vnto the wicked, thou shalt surely dye: and thou hast not given him warning, nor spakest to admo∣nish the wicked from his wiked way, that hee might liue; the same wicked man shall dye in his iniquitie; but his bloud will I require at theyr hand. Yet if they had warned the wicked, and hee turne not from his wickednesse:
nor from his wicked way he shall dye in his iniquitie; but such Ministers should haue delivered theyr owne soule: Ezek. 3, 17, 33, 2, 2, 8, 2, 4, 5. Isay, 49, 4 5. Ob. Some of these might haue beene more faithfull in their Ministery, if in the discharge thereof, they did with godly Zeale, and discreet courage expresse themselues, and theyr Conscien∣ces? A. Therefore say vnto such a one, thus saith the Lord; If thou take away the precious from the vile, thou shalt be accor∣ding to my word; let them returne vnto thee: but returne not thou vnto them. And I will make thee vnto this people a strong brasen Wall, and they shall fight a∣gainst thee; but they shall not prevale a∣gainst thee: for I am wth thee to saue thee. And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeeme thee out of the hand of the tyrants: Ier. 15.19. Thou therefore trusse vp thy loynes,
and arise, and speake vnto them all that I mmand thee: be not afraid of their fa∣s, least I destroy thee before them: Ier. , 17, 20.11.26, 24. Ezek. 2.6, 3, 9, 2, 4, 5. Q. I now see the worke of a Mini∣ster to bee of importance: what there∣fore is the peoples dutie towards im? A. Against an Elder receiue not an ccusation vnder two, or three witnes∣es: 1, Tim, 5 19. 2 Say to A chippus looke well to thy Minsterie thou hast received in the LORD, that thou fulfill it: Colos. 4, 17. 3 Becaus the Harvest is great, and the labourers are few▪ therefore pray yee to the Lord of the Harvest that he would send forth more Labourers into his Harvest: Math. 9, 37. 2 Say, let thy Priests bee clothed with righteousnesse, and let thy Saints showt for ioy: Psal. 132.9. 3 As of LEVI it was said, Let thy V∣rim, and thy Thummim, be with thy
holy ones, (Deut. 33 8.) That vtte∣rance also may be giuen ē that they may open their mouthes boldly; to make knowne the mysteries of the Gospell: (Ephes. 6.19. Col. 4.3 4,) That so, for the gift bestowed vpon vs, by the meanes of many persons; thankes may bee giuen by many, on our behalfe. 2. Cor. 1.11. 4 That they may be deliuered from vn∣reasonable, and wicked men; because all men haue not faith: 2. Thess. 3.2. Rom. 15.30. 5 That their seruice may bee acceptable to the Saints. Rom. 15.31. 6 Finally pray, that the word of the Lord may haue a free course, and bee glorifi∣ed: 2. Thss. 3, 1. 4 Let him that is taught in the word, communicate vnto him that teacheth in al good things: (Gal. 6.6.) For the scripture saith, thou shalt not mousle the mouth of the Oxe, that treadeth out the cone. And the laborer is worthy of his reward, (1. Tim 5.18.) If ye be made partaker of their spiri∣tuall
things, your duty is also to minister vnto them in carnall things: (Rom. 15, 27.) For will a man robbe GOD? (Mal. 3.8.) Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reape. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spi∣rit reape Life everlasting: Gal. 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 9.7. Mal. 3, 9, 10. Gen. 47.22. Deut. 12.19. 2 Chron. 31 4, 5. 5 Let the Elders which rule well bee ounted worthy of double honour; especi∣lly they, who labour in the Word, and Do∣trine: (1 Tim. 5.17.) And let no man despse such: (1 Cor. 16, 11.) but esteeme hem very highly, in loue; for their workes sake: 1 Thess. 5, 12. 6. Obey them that haue the rule over you, and submit your selues; for they watch for your Soules; as they that must giue an account, that they may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe; for that is vnprofi∣table for you: (Heb. 13.7. 1 Cor. 16.16.) Therefore doe according to that thing
which they shew you; according to the Law which they shall teach you; and according to the iudgement, which they shall tell you, shall you doe: you shall not decline from the thing which they shall shew you; neither to the right hand, nor to the left: Deut. 17, 10. Heb. 13 7. Q. What is the danger of such as doe not honour, but doe offer wrong, and dishonour to their Minister? A. If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and de∣voureth their Enemies. And if any man will hurt them, hee must in this manner bee killed; For these haue power to shut Heaven, that it raine not in the dayes of their Prophesie; and haue power over Waters, to turne them to Blood, and to strike the Earth with all plagues, as often as they will: Reu. 11.5. Ob. I would bee loath to hurt our Minister; but yet what if his life be not answerable to his Doctrine? A. Though hee be as wicked, as were the Scribes, and Pharises; yet hee
sits in MOSES seate; all therefore whatsoever hee bids you obserue, that ob∣serue, and doe; but after his workes doe not; because hee saith, and doth not▪ Math. 23, 2. Ob. But hee is also so vnlearned a man, that in one Sermon of many, you shall not heare one word of Latine, or Greke, to come out of his mouth? A. Brethren if your Minister come vnto you speaking with tongues what shall he profit you; except hee shall speake to you, eyther by Revelation, or by Know∣ledge, or by Prophesying, or by Doctrine? And even things without life, giving sound; whether Pipe, or Harpe; except they giue a distinction in the sounds; how shall it be knowne, what is piped, or harped? For if the Trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to the battell? So likewise wee, except we vtter by the tongue words easie to be vnderstood; how shall it be knowne what is spoken? For we shall speake into the ayre. There are it may bee, so many kindes of voyces in the
world; and none of them are without signi∣cation. Therefore if I know not the mea∣ning of the voyce, I shall bee to him that speaketh a Barbarian; and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian vnto me. 1. Cor. 14.6.1.14.2.14.21. Ob. It seemes you are an English Preacher; you plead so much against tongues? A. I thanke my GOD, I speake lan∣guages more then they all; yet in the Church I had rather speake fiue words, with my vn∣derstanding, that by my voyce I might teach others also; then ten thousand words in a strange tongue. 1. Cor. 14.18.19. Ob. Whatsoeuer you alledge against the vse of tongues, yet as I hope, you will not deny, vnto such Ministers, the greatest praise, as are most eloquent? A. The things of GOD we speake; not in the words, which mans wisedome tea∣cheth; but which the holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spirituall things, with spirituall, (1, Cor. 2.1.) that your faith should not stand in the wisedome of men, but in the
power of God. (1. Cor. 2.5.) For CHRIST nt mee to preach the Gospell; not with wisedome of words, least the crosse  CHRIST, should bee made of none fect. (1. Cor. 1.17.) But seeing the orld by wisedome knew not GOD;  pleased GOD, by the foolishnesse of reaching, to saue them that beleeue: 1. Cor. 1.21.) Wee haue therefore re∣unced, the hidden things of dishone∣ie; not walking in craftinesse, nor ndling the Word of GOD deceitful∣; but by the manifestation of the ruth, commending our selues to every ans Conscience, in the sight of GOD. . Corinth. 4.2.) Not Preaching our lues; but CHRIST IESVS the LORD, and our selues your ser∣ants for IESVS sake. 2. Cor. 4.5. .2.1. Ob. Then as it seemes to you, euery Minister as well for matter as manner of eaching must suite himselfe to the capa∣city of his auditorie, &c. A. True. For we haue many things to
say, and hard to bee vttered. Not because wee cannot speake them; but because you are dull of hearing. For when for the time you ought to be Teachers; you haue need that one teach you againe which bee the first principles of the Oracles of God, and are become such as haue need of milke, and not of strong meate. For every one that vseth milke, is vnskilfull in the word of Righteousnesse; for he is a Babe: (Heb. 5 11.) And I brethren could not speake vnto you, as vnto Spirituall men, but as vnto Carnall; even as vnto babes in CHRIST. I haue fed you with Milke, and not with Meate, for hitherto yee were not able, to beare it; neither yet now are yee able: 1. Cor. 3, 1, 2. Q. Are wee therefore alwayes to be deat withall like Children, and to bee fed like Babes? A. No longer than while yee be∣come vnto full age, and are such as haue your sences exercised, to dscerne both good, and evill: (Heb. 5.14) Whereby it appearing that you are become strong men;
then leaving the principles of the doctrine of CHRIST, let vs goe on vnto perfection; not laying the foundation of Repentance, from dead workes, and of faith towards GOD; of the Doctrine of Baptismes, and of laying on of hands, and of the Resurrecti∣on from the dead, and of eternall Iudgment: Heb. 6, 1. Q It neyther the frequent vse of tongues: nor humane eloquence: nor deepe, and profound teaching, bee of e∣steeme with you: I pray tell me where∣in you Ministers are in your teaching, most praise worth? A. Doe we begin againe to commend our selues; or need we as some others, E∣pistles of commendations to you; or letters of commendations from you? Ye are our E∣pistle, written in our hearts, knowne, and read of all men. For as much as ye are ma∣nifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ, ministred by vs; written not with Inke, but with the spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust haue wee through
Christ to Godward, not that we are suffi∣cient of our selues; but our sufficiencie is of God; who hath also made vs able Mi∣nisters, of the new Testament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kil∣leth, but the Spirit giveth life: (2, Cor. 3, 1.) And are not you my worke in the LORD? If I be not an Apostle vnto others, yet doubtlesse I am to you; for the Seale of my Apostleship, are yee in the LORD: 1, Corinth. 9, 1, 2. Q But why should GOD vse the Ministrie of men, and not of An∣gels? A. Wee haue this treasure in earthen vessels; that the excellency of the power, may be of GOD, and not of vs: 2, Cor. 4, 7. 2 Every high Priest, taken from among men, is ordained for men, in things per∣taining to God; that he may offer both guifts, and sacrifices for sins, who can haue compassion on the ignorant, and of them, that are out of the way; for that hee him∣selfe
also is compassed with infirmity: Heb. 5, 1, 2. Ob. The case so being, Christ Iesus himselfe, being both God, and Man: had beene a Minister, without all exception? A. I tell you the truth: it was expedi∣ent for you, that hee goe away; for if hee had not gone away, the Comforter would not come vnto you; but in that hee depar∣ted, he hath sent him vnto you, &c. Who beeing come, hee doth guide you into all truth: &c. (Ioh. 16, 7, 13.) Let men therefore teach, to obserue, all things whatsoever hee commandeth you; and loe hee is with you, even vnto the end of the World: Mathew, 28, 20. CHAP. XXXIIII. Of the Sacraments. Ob. IF the Ministrie of the Word be no lesse efficatious, then as
you haue said it is; what further need is there of the Sacraments? A. Circumcision verily profiteth: (Rom. 2, 25.) For Abraham received the signe of Circumcision: a Seale of the righteous∣nesse of Faith: (Rom. 4.11. Act, 7, 8.) In whom you also are circumcised, with the Circumcision made without hands: in putting off the body of the sins, of the flesh; by the Circumcision of CHRIST: Col. 2, 11. Deut, 10, 16. Q What promise hath GOD made to Bptisme? A. Tha he will baptize thee with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. (Math. 3, 11.) For by one spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether wee be Iewes or Gentiles; whether we be bond or free: (1, Cor. 12, 13.) Whereby Baptisme doth now saue vs: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh; but the answer of a good conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of IESVS CHRIST: 1, Pet. 3, 21. Acts, 16, 14. Luk. 7, 29, 30. Q. Vnto whom doth this belong?
A. 1, To the Ministers, that they teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost: Math 28, 19. 2 To the people, to doe as the publi∣cans; who iustified GOD, being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn. And not to o as the Pharisies, and Lawyers, who reie∣cted the counsell of God against themselues: being not baptized of him: Luk, 7, 29.30. Gen. 17, 14. Q. See thn, here is water: what doth hinder me to be baptized? Acts 8, 36. A, 1 If thou beleevest with all thine heart thou mayest? (Act, 8 37) For can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who haue received the Holy Ghost as well as we? Act, 10.47. 2 You must amend your liues, (Act. 2, 38.) And circumcise the fore-skin of your heart: (Deut. 10.16.) And then be bapti∣zed every one of you in the name of IESVS CHRIST: Acts, 2, 38. Ob. If Faith, and Repentance bee ne∣cessary vnto Baptisme: seeing Infants
cannot actually beleeue, nor repent; are they therefore to bee excluded from this Sacrament? A. Suffer little Children to come vnto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdome of God: (Math. 19.14.) And if the root be holy so are the branches: (Rom. 11, 16.) For the promise was made to Abra∣ham, and his seed: Gal. 3, 16. Gen. 17, 2, 7▪ 17, 12, 21, 4. Acts, 2, 39. Q Doth the efficacie of Baptisme depend on the worthinesse of the Mini¦ster? A. No: but on whom, thou shalt see the Spirit descend, and remaine on him; the same is he that doth Baptize, with the Holy Ghost: (Ioh. 1, 33) Iohn in deed baptized with Water: but yee shall bee baptized with the Holy Ghost: Math. 3, 11. Q. What need then is there of the Supper of the Lord? A. The Cup of blessing which we blesse: is it not the Communion of the bloud of Christ? The Bread which we breake, is it
not the Communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread: (1, Cor. 10, 16.) Therefore saith Christ; take, eate, this is my body: and of the Cup, drinke yee all of it: for this is my bloud of the new Testament, which is shed for many, for the Remission of sinnes: (Math. 26.26.) This doe as often as yee doe it, in remembrance of me. For as often as yee eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup, yee doe shew the Lords Death till hee come: 1, Corinth. 11, 25, 11, 23. Q. May any prophane person bee admitted vnto the Supper of the Lord? A. No: for if any shall eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup of the Lord vnworthily, he shall be guiltie of the body and Bloud of the LORD: and he eateth, and drinketh Iudgement to himselfe, not discerning the Lords body: 1, Cor. 11.27, 29. Moreover they cannot drinke the Cup
of the Lord and the Cup of Divels: they cannot be partakers of the Lords Table and the Table of Divels: (1, Cor. 10, 21.) For thus saith the LORD GOD: no stran∣ger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncir∣cumcised in flesh; shall enter into my Sanctuary, that is among the Children of Israel: Exek. 44, 9. Ezod. 12 48. Leuit. 2, 13. Q. What is then to bee done before our comming vnto this Sacrament? A. Let a man examine himselfe and so let him eat of that bread, and drinke of that cup: (1, Cor. 11, 28) Also if a stranger shall soiourne among you, and will keep this Sup∣per vnto the Lord: according to the ordi∣nance, and according, to the manner there∣of; so shall he doe: (Numb. 9, 14.) Who if he doe also iudge himselfe: he shall not be iudged. 1 Cor. 11, 31. Ob. This search I haue made, and can find but one sin, which I desire to retaie; now the good Lord bee mercifull vnto thy Servant in ths point: 2, Kin, 5, 18. A. Know yee not that a little leaven,
aveneth the whole Lumpe? Purge ut therefore the old leaven, that yee may  a new lumpe as yee are now vnleave∣ed: for even CHRIST our Passeover,  sacrificed for vs. Therefore let vs keepe e feast not with old leaven, nether with  leaven of malice, and wickednesse, t with the vnleavened bread of sincerity, d truth: 1, Cor. 5, 6. Therefore if thou bring thy guift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy rother, hath ought against thee: leaue here thy guift before the Altar, and goe y way: first be reconciled to thy Brorher, d then come, and offer thy guift: Math. , 23. Psal. 26, 6. Ob. When we haue done all we can  preparing our selues, yet shall we faile f that which is written. A. Therefore with Hzekiah, pray, say∣ng; The good Lord pardon every one, that repareth his heart, to seeke God; the Lord f his Fathers; though he be not cleansed ac∣ording to the purification of the Sanctu∣ry. After which Prayer so made,
the LORD will hearken vnto thee, and will heale thee: (2. Chro. 30.18.) For when AARON was to minister; hee was to put vpon his forehead a plate of pure gold; on which was ingrauen holinesse to the LORD; that AARON might beare the iniquitie of the holy things; which the children of ISRAEL should hallow, in all their holy gifts, which was alwayes to bee vpon his forehead, that they might bee ac∣cepted before the LORD: (Exo. 28.26.) So was there also ordained, a Goat for a sinne offering, which was for the people; the blood whereof was to be sprinkled vpon the Mercy seate, and before the mercy seat; wherewith the Priest was to make an a∣tonement, for the holy place; because of the vncleannesse of the children of ISRAEL; and because of their transgressions, in all their sinnes, and make an atonement for the Priests, and for all the people of the Congregation: Leu. 16.15.16.33. verses. Q. What if any man, that is apt for the Sacrament; shall wilfully neglect the same?
A. The man that is cleane, and is not  Iourney; and forbeareth to keepe the seover; even the same Soule, shall bee  off from his people; because he brought  the offering of the Lord, in his appoin∣d season: that man shall beare his sinne. umb. 9, 13. Exod. 4.24. CHAP. XXXV. Of Discipline. Ob, I Know some, who notwith∣standing the frequent vse of  these meanes of Grace: haue falne y fearefully. A. Therefore GOD hath to the for∣er meanes added Discipline: saying; hou shalt not hate thy Brother in thine eart: but thou shalt in any wise rebuke y Neighbour, and not suffer sinne vpon im: (Leuit. 19, 17.) For as Iron sharpe∣eth Iron: so a man sharpeneth the counte∣ance of his friend: Prou. 27, 17.
Q How am I to deale with such one, that he may be reclaimd? A. If thy brother shal trespasse against thee goe, and tell him his fault, betweene the and him alone: if he shall heare thee; tho hast gained thy brother. But if hee will no heare thee; then take with thee, one, o two more; that in the mouth of tw or three witnesses, euery word may be established. And if hee shall neglect  heare them, tell it vnto the Church: Math 18.15.16. Q. What if hee shall neglect to hear the Church? A. I verily as absent in body, but pre¦sent in spirit, haue iudged already, a though I were present concerning suc a one, in the name of our Lord IESV CHRIST, when yee are gathered together &c. to deliuer such a one vnto Sathan; fo the destruction of the flesh; that the spiri may be saued, in the day of our Lord IESVS: (1 Cor. 5.3.5.) Verily I say vnto you; That as whatsoeuer yee shall loos on Earth, shall bee loosed in Heauen;
so whatsoeuer yee shall bind on earth, shall  bound in Heaven. (Mth. 18.18.) And  they whose sinnes yee remit they are re∣tted vnto them: so whose sinnes so ever  retaine, they are retained: Ih. 20, 23. rou. 15.10. Q. What if notwithstanding this Churches censure, hee shall remaine ob∣nate in sinning; as was Himineus, and Alexander? 1 Tim. 1, 20. A. Let him bee vnto thee, as an Hea∣en man, and a Publicane: (Math. 18 17.) And call him reprobate silver; because e Lord hath reiected him: (Ier. 6, 30.) nd withdraw your selfe from him, (2. est. 3 6) and note him; and haue no mpany with him; that hee may be a∣med: 2 Thss. 3, 14. Hos. 4, 17. Q. But may I not still seeke to re∣laime him? A. Giue not that which is holy vnto ogs; neither cast your pearles before ine; least they trample them vnder their eet, and turne againe, and rent you: (Mat. , 6.) For bee that reproveth a scorner,
getteth to himselfe shame; and hee that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himselfe a blot. Reprooue not a scorner, least hee hate thee: (Prou. 9.7.) For correction is grievous, to him that forsaketh the way; neither will hee goe vnto the wise: Prou. 15.10, 12. Q. What if such a one, in the sence of this Curse, shall come to bee truly humbled for his sinne? A. Sufficient, vnto such a man, is this punishment; so that contrariwise, yee ought rather to forgiue him, and comfort him; least perhaps, such a one, should bee swallowed vp with overmuch sorrow. Wherefore I beseech you, that you would confirme your loue towards him; least Sa∣than should get an advantage over him: for wee are not ignorant of his devi∣ces: 2. Corinth. 2, 6, 7. 11, 2, 2, 1, 2. Prou. 27.9.
CHAP. XXXVI. Of the Continuance, with GODS blessing on the meanes of Grace. Q. YOu haue in some measure satisfi∣ed mee, concerning the meanes of perseuerance in Grace; but haue wee any assurance that all these meanes of Grace, shall bee continued? A. I will dwell among you: (Exod. 29.45.) And set my Sanctuarie in the midst of you, for evermore. My Tabernacle also shall bee with you; yea, I will be your GOD, and you shall bee my people. And the Heathen shall know, that I the LORD doe sanctifie Israel; when my Sanctuarie shall be in the middest of you, for ever∣more: Ezek. 37, 26. Leuit. 26.11, 12. Exod. 29, 42. Ob. Though these meanes of Grace should bee continued; yet may I grow wearie, in the vse of them?
A. One thing haue I desired of the Lord, which I wll seeke after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord, all the dayes of my lfe; to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple: (Psal. 27 4.) For I haue loved the habitation of his house, and the place where h honour dwelleth: P. 26 8.) Lk ws it shall come to passe; that from one new Moone, vnto another and from one Sbbath to ano∣ther; shall all Flesh come to worship before mee, s he LORD: Isa 66, 23. Ob. Notwithstanding the continued vse of these meanes; Grace it selfe may decay? A. In all places where GOD doth re∣cord his Name: hee will blesse thee: Exod. 20, 24.) The Lord shall blesse thee out of Zion: (Psal. 128.5.) So that thou shalt flourish like a Palme tree, and like a Cedar in Libanon. Those that be planted in the house of the LORD, shall flourish in the Courts of our GOD: they shall bring foorth fruit in old age; they shall be fat, and flourishing: to shew that the
Lord is vpright, he is my rocke, and that there is no vnrighteousnesse in him: Psal. 92, 12, 84, 7 65 4. 1, Cor. 15, 10. Math. 13, 1, 32. Isa. 61, 11. Q. What is required of vs, to the nd, that these meanes of Grace, may be thus continued with successe? A. 1 Get Davids appetite after them, aying; As the heart panteth after the wa∣r brookes; so doth my heart pant, after hee, O GOD. My Soule thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come, nd appeare before God? (Psal. 42, 1.) My Soule longeth; yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: my heart, and my flesh rieth out for the living God, &c. For a ay in his Courts is better than a thousand;  had rather be a doore keeper in the house f my God: than to dwell in the tents of ickednesse: Psal. 84, 1, 10. verses, 63, 1, 2, 137, 5, 6. 2 A delight in them. Reioyce with Ie∣usalem, and bee glad with her: all you hat loue her; reioyce, for ioy with her, ll you that mourne for her: that yo
may sucke, and bee satisfied, with the breasts of her consolation: that you may milke out, and be delighted, with the aboundance of her glory: Isay, 66, 10. 3 Pray saying: O send out thy light, and thy truth; let them leade mee: let them bring mee, vnto thy holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles: (Psalm. 43, 3.) Send mee helpe from thy Sanctuary: and strengthen mee out of Zion. Re∣member all my offerings; and accept my burnt Sacrifice: Psalm. 20, 2, 3. 134.3. 4 Keepe thy foot when thou enterest into the house of God and be more neere to heare, than to giue the Sacrifice of fooles: (Eccl. 5, 1.) For which end, wash thy hands in innocencie, and so compasse the Altars of God: Psal. 26, 6. 5 When you come to worship the LORD, in the beautie of holinesse: (Psal. 96, 9.) Worship the Father in spirit, and in truth; for the Father seeketh such, to wor∣ship him. GOD is a spirit, and they that
worship him; must worship him in spi∣rit, and truth, Iob. 4.23. 6 Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy; for the LORD blessed the Sab∣bath day, and hallowed it: (Exod. 20.8, 11.) Wherefore if thou turne away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy will, on my holy day: and call the Sabbath a delight: and consecrate is, as glorious to the LORD; and shalt honour him: not doing thine owne wayes, not seeking thine owne will, not spea∣king a vaine word, then shalt thou de∣light in the LORD, and I will feed thee with the hreitage of IACOB thy Father: For the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it: (a. 58, 13.) Blessed is the man that doth this, and the Sonne of man which layeth hold on it, (Isa. 56, 2.) And embraceth my Cove∣nant: him will I bring vnto my Ho∣ly Mountaine, and make him ioyfull in mine house of Prayer: Isa. 56, 6.7. Reu. , 10. Q. If I should forbeare my worke on
the Sabbath day, I should come to beg∣gery, at the last? A. See; for that the LORD, hath given you the Sabbath: therefore hee gi∣veth you on the sixt day, the bread of two dayes: therefore abide you every man in his place: let no man goe out of his place on the seaventh day: Exod. 16, 29, 16, 5. CHAP XXXVII Of Temporall Blessings, and in parti∣culer of long life. Q. ALl these promises, you haue mentioned: are of singular vse vnto the Soule: but what provision shall we haue for the body? A. You shall inherit the earth: (Math. 5, 5.) For as CHRIST, so the world is yours: 1, Cor. 3, 22. Ob. What will the world profit vs, if wee bee taken away by Death: and be
accounted among them that goe downe into the pit? Shall Gods loving kind∣nesse bee declared in the Graue? Or his faithfulnesse in destruction? Psalm. 88, 4, 11. A. If thou forget not my Law, and thy heart keepe my Commandements; length of dayes, and long life shall they adde vnto thee: (Prou. 3 1.) And the yeares of thy life shall be many: (Prou. 4.10.) And there shall old men, and old women dwell in the streets of Ierusalem, & every man, with his staffe in his hand, for very age. (Zach. 8, 4.) There shall bee there no more an Infant of dayes: nor an old man, that hath not filled his dayes: for the Child shall dye an hundred yeares old. For as the dayes of a Tree, are the dayes of my people: (Isa. 65, 20, 22.) And with long life will I satisfie them: (Psalm. 91, 16.) For they shall see their Childrens Children: (Psal. 128, 6.) And come vnto their Graue in a full age, like as a shocke of Corne commeth, in due season, into the Barne: (Iob. 5,
26.) As well as ABRAHAM: who dyed in a good old age, an old man, and full of yeares: Gen. 25, 8. Psal. 33, 18, 19. Ier. 45, 5, 39, 17. Gen. 15, 15, 35, 29 47, 28, 50. 23. Iudg. 8, 32. 1, Chron. 29, 28, 2, 24, 15. 1, Sam. 25, 29. Q. Is long Life a blessing of any worth? A. The hoarie head is a Crowne of Glory, if it be found in the way of Righte∣ousnesse: (Prou. 16, 31.) For as the beau∣ty of young men is their stregnth: so the glory of the aged, is their gray head: Prou. 20, 29. Q. Is this promise, of long life, a bles∣sing, common vnto all? A. No: for GOD shall bring the wic∣ked downe, into the pit of destruction: the bloudy and deceitfull man shall not liue ou halfe his dayes: (Psal. 55.23.) His confidence shall he rooted out, of his Taber∣nacle; and it shall bring him to the King of terrors: (Iob. 28, 14.) As the whirle∣wind passeth; so is the wicked no more: onely the righteous is an everlasting foun∣dation:
(Prou. 10.25.) For as righteous∣nesse, tendeth vnto life: so he that pursueth evill pursueth it, to his owne death: Prou. 11, 19, 10, 27. Psal. 145, 20. Ob. But doe you not see many of the wicked; how theyr dayes are prolon∣ged? A. The woman that liveth in plea∣sure, is dead while she liveth: (1, Tim. 5, 6) And men living ruitlessely, are, as trees, twice dead, and plucked vp by the rootes: (Iud. 12) And therefore, though a sinner, doe evill an hundred times, and his dayes be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall bee well with them that feare GOD, which feare before him: Ecc. 8, 12. Q, What would you hence in∣ferre? A. Therefore bee thou not overmuch wicked; neither bee thou foolish: for why shouldest thou dye, before thy time? (Eccl. 7, 17.) But set your hearts vnto all th words which I testifie among you this day: that yee may command them vnto your Children; that they may obserue and doe
all the words of this Law. For it is no vaine word, concerning you; but it is your life, & by this word yee shall prolong your dayes, Deut. 32, 46, 47, 4, 40.6, 1 2 16.20. Q. Why? doth God for the sinnes of his owne Children, shorten theyr dayes also? A. Yea: for Moses; because hee trespassed against the LORD, died in the Mount Nebo, (Deut, 32, 50) For this cause also, many of the Corinthians were weake, and sicke, and falne asleepe: 1, Cor. 11, 30. 1 Sam. 2, 30, 31. But yet when they are thus iudged; they are chastened of the Lord: that they should not be condemned with the world: (1, Cor. 11, 32.) And be taken away from the evill to come: (Isa. 57, 1.) For Iosia was gathered to his Fathers in peace; that his eyes might not see all the evill that was to come vpon the Nation of the Iewes: 2, Chron. 34, 27.
CHAP. XXXVIII. Of preservation from Dangers. Ob. THough my dayes vpon earth should bee many; yet the ma∣ny dangers attending them, will make my life without comfort? A. Who so hearkeneth vnto me, shall dwell safely; and shall bee quiet, from the feare of evill: (Pro. 1.33.) Remember I pray thee; who euer perished, being in∣nocent? or where were the righteous cut off? (Iob. 4.7.) The humble person shall deliuer the Iland of the innocents; and it is deliuered, by the purenesse of thine hands. (Iob. 22.30.) Whereby thou shalt walke in thy way safely; and thy foote shall not stumble: when thou lyest downe, thou shalt not be afraid; yea thou shalt lye downe and thy sleepe shall bee sweet: (Prou. 3, 23.) Surely thou shalt not be moued, for euer. Thou shalt not be afraid of evill tidings; thy heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.
Thy heart is established; thou shalt not be afraid: (Psal. 112, 6.) But shalt bee as Mount Zion, which cannot bee removed, but abideth for ever. As the Mountaines, are round about Ierusalem: so the Lord is round about his people; from henceforth, even for ever: Psal. 125.1. Therefore hearken vnto me, O house of Iacob; and all the remnants, of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly; which are carryed from the wombe; and even to your old age I am hee, and even to your hoarie haires I will carry you, and so will deliver you: Isa. 46, 3. Psal. 34, 4, 4, 8 27, 5.121, 3, 4, 8, 16, 8, 63, 8, 7, 10.11.3, 4. Zach. 10, 12. Acts, 2, 25. Prou. 18, 10. Deut. 33, 12. Isa. 4 5. Ob. I know the rage of our enemies to bee such; as they will leaue, no meanes vnattempted, for our hurt. A. The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him; but the Lord will not leaue him in his hands, nor condemne him, when hee is iudged: (Psal. 37, 32.) Hee shall hide him in the secret of his pre∣sence,
from the pride of men; he shall keepe them secretly in a pavilion, from the strife f tongues: (Psal. 31, 20.) As Birds y flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend Ierusalem, defending also he will deliver it; and passing over, hee will preserue it: (Isa. 31.5.) Whereby no man shall set n thee to hurt thee: (Acts, 18.10.) Nei∣ther shall one haire of your head perish: (Luk. 21, 18.) For the Lord will deliver ou from every evill worke; and will pre∣erue you, to his heavenly Kingdome: 2, Tim. 4, 18. Therefore feare you not; stand still, and ee the Salvation which the Lord will shew u: (Exod. 14, 13.) And be not afraid of heir faces; for I am with thee: to deli∣er thee, saith the Lord: (Ier. 1, 8.) Behold I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my ands; thy walles are continually before e: Isa. 49, 16 54, 17 27, 2, 3. Exod. 14, 10, 23, 22. Ier. 1, 18, 15, 20. Psal. 12, 8, 108. 3. Acts. 9, 24, 25.9, 29, 30 31. Numb. 22 12, 18, 24, 1. 2, King. 6, 10. Neh. 4, 15. Deut. 20, 3. Isa. 31, 4.
Ob. My enemies doe so much ouer∣match mee, as that before the combate, they doe promise vnto themselues the conquest, saying; Let her be defiled, let our eye looke vpon Zion: Micha, 4, 11. Exod. 15 9. A. Who hath despised the day of the small things? (Zch. 4, 10.) Let not him, that girdeth on his harnesse, boast him∣selfe; as hee that putteth it off: 1 King. 20, 11. Wee haue heard of the pride of Moab; he is exceeding proud, his loftinesse and his arrogancie, and his pride, and the haughtinesse of his heart; I know his wrath, saith the LORD: but it shall not be so: (Ierem. 48, 29.) But because hey rage against mee; and thei tumult, is come vp into mine eares: therefore will I put my hooke into their nose, and my bridle into their lippes; and I will turne them backe by the way, by which they come: Isa. 37, 29.29, 8. For hee powreth contempt vpon Prin∣ces; and causeth them to wander in the
Wildernesse, where there is no way; yet setteth hee the poore on high from afflicti∣on, and maketh him families, like a flocke: (Psal. 107.40.) Hee frustrateth the to∣kens of lyers, and maketh Diviners mad; and turneth wise men backward, and ma∣keth their Knowledge foolishnesse: Isa. 44, 25. Therefore bee strong, and of good cou∣rage; feare not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy GOD, he it is that doth goe with thee: he will not faile thee, nor forsake thee: (Deut. 31, 6.) With them is an arme of flesh; but with you is the Lord your GOD, to helpe, and to fight your battels: 2 Chron. 32 8.20, 15. Ios. 1, 5. Isa. 50, 1.44 25, 18, 7.9, 15, 16. 2 Sam. 16, 23. 17, 14. Ierem. 1, 18.15, 26. Iob, 41, 34. 2 Kng. 19 32. Zach. 12, 7. Examples. 1 Sam. 18, 11.1.21, 1.1.25, 10.1.23, 14.1.23, 25.14, 44. 2 Sam. 21, 16.2.20, 22. Acts. 14, 5.14, 19, 20. 26, 21. Psal. 105, 12. Ob. Though GOD should preserue vs once, and againe, from our Enemies;
yet if they bee suffered to stand in their strength; ours is the feare, and theirs is the hope, of their preuailing at the last. A. But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither vnderstand they his councell; for hee shall gather them as the sheaues into his floore. (Micha. 4.12.) Be∣hold they shall gather together; but not by me, whosoeuer shall gather together a∣gainst thee, shall fall for thy sake. (Isa. 54.15.) Now will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; Now will I lift vp my selfe; they shall conceiue chaffe, they shall bring foorth stubble; their breath as fire shall deuoure them, And the peo∣ple shalbe as the burning of le as thornes cut vp shall they bee burnt in the fire: (Isa. 33.10.) And as ashes vnder the soles of your feete in the day that I shall doe this, saith the Lord of hosts: Mal. 4.3. Thus when SIHON gathered all his people together, to fight against Israel; Israel smote him, with the edge of the
sword: (Num. 21.23.) Also OG the King f Bashan, with his sonnes, and all his peo∣le; vntill none was left aliue: (Numb. 21.35.) So shall yee also know, that I am the LORD your GOD, dwelling in Zion, my holy Mountaine; then shall Ierusalem bee holy, and there shall no Stranger passe through her any more: Ioel, 3, 17. Isa 41.10.41.15.16. Deut. 9, 3, 7.22, 3.21.22, 33, 17. Ios. 21 44. Psal. 89, 23. Isa. 63, 3.26, 1. Examples: Numb. 31, 7, 8. 1 Sam. 19, 8, 1, 27, 8, 1, 30, 16. 2 Sam. 3, 1, 2, 5, 25. 8, 1, 2, 6, 13, 14.2, 12, 26. Exod. 17, 13. 14, 30. 2, Chron. 32, 21. 2 King. 19, 35. Ios. 10, 40.12 20. Ob. But our Enemies are many, and mighty; and therefore not to bee sub∣dued? A. GOD shall breake in pieces mightie men without number, & set others in their stead: (Iob, 34 24.) Hee is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who hath harde∣ned him selfe against him, and prospered? Which removeth the Mountaines, and they
know not: which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the Earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble, &c. Behold hee taketh away: who can hinder him? Who will say vnto him, what doest thou? If GOD will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers doe stoope vnder him: (Iob. 9.4 12.) But your Enemies are men, and not GOD: their Horses flesh, and not spirit: when the Lord shall stretch out his hand; both hee that helpeth shall fall, and hee that is holpen shall fall downe; and they shall all faile together: (Isa. 31.3.) For there is none like vnto the GOD of Iesur: Who rideth vpon the Heavens, in thy helpe, and in his Ex∣cellencie on the skie. The Eternall GOD is thy refuge: and vnderneath are the e∣verlasting armes; and hee shall thrust out the Enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them: (Deut. 3.26.) Whereby thou shalt know, that the Lord is greater than all Gods: for in the thing, wherein they deale proudly, hee is aboue them: (. 18, 11.) For the Chariots of the
Lord are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels: the Lord is among you, as in Sinai; in the holy place: (Psal. 68, 17) And hee shall bring them downe that dwell on high: the loftie Citie, he layeth it low, he bringeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. The foote shall tread it downe; even the feet of the poore, and the steps of the eedie: Isa. 26, 5. For a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakins; the LORD destroy∣ed before Israel: (Dut. 2, 21.) Of whom it was said; who can stand before the Children of ANA? (Deut. 9, 2) Were not the Aethiopians also, and the Lu∣bim an huge Host; with very many Cha∣riots, and Horse-men? yet because AS did rely on the Lord, hee delivered them into his hand: 2 Chron. 16 8. If therefore thou shalt say, in thine heart; These Nations are moe then I: how can I dispossesse them? Thou shalt not bee afraid of them; but shalt well remember what the Lord thy GOD did
vnto PHARAOH, and vnto all Aegypt; the great temptations, which thine eyes saw, and the signes, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arme, whereby the LORD brought thee out. So shall the Lord thy God doe vnto all the people, of whom thou art afraid, &c. Deut. 7, 17. Numb. 23, 23. Psal. 91, 13. 1, Sam. 2, 9. Deut. 20.1.33, 29.11.22.23.2, Sam. 5 20. Isa. 40 12.40, 22, 40. 8.63 3. Psal. 108.10.60, 12. Examples, Deut. 4, 37.3.8. Ios. 23.9.11, 1. Iudg. 7, 12. 1, Sam. 13 5. Ob. You tell me of great things, the Lord will doe for his people; but I see no meanes to effect the same? A. He will haue Mercy vpon the house of Iudah; and will saue them by the Lord their GOD: and will not saue them by Bow, nor by Sword, nor by Battaile, by Horses, nor by Horsemen: (Hos. 1, 7,) But by a sling, and a stone, (1, Sam, 17.49) With trumpets of Rams-hornes, (Ios. 6, 20) With an Oxe goade, (Iudg. 3, 31.) By Iel Hebeus wife: (Iudg. 5.27) By Ehud, a
man lame on his right hand: (Iudg. 3.15.) By Gedeon, whose family was least in his Fathers House: (6, 15.) And that when there was no Smith in Israel: 1, Sam. 13.19. One man shall chase a thousand, and two put tenne thousand to flight: (Deut. 32.30. Ios. 23.10.) As with Ionathan, and his armour bearer, (1, Sam. 14.13.) And in the want of other meanes; one enemie, shall helpe to destroy another: 2, Chron, 20.22. Iudg. 7.22.2, Chron. 20.17. 2, King. 19.6. For hee will send his feare before thee: (Exod. 23, 27.) And he will put the dread of thee, and the feare of thee vpon the Na∣tions, that are vnder the whole Heaven: who shall heare report of thee, and shall tremble and bee in anguish, because of thee: (Deutrinom. 2, 25.) They shall licke the dust like a Serpent; they shall mooue out of their holes like Wormes of the Earth; they shall bee afraid of the LORD our GOD; and shall feare because of thee: Micha, 7, 17.
As well as SAVL, who was afraid of DAVID; because the Lord was with him: (1 Sam. 18, 12.) So the hearts of all the Kings of the Amorites fainted: (Ios. 5.1.) And were in great feare; for GOD is in the generation of the Righteous: Psal. 14 5. Isa. 19, 17.33.14. Zach. 12.1. Deut. 11.25.28 10. Ios. 29. Num. 22, 3. Psal. 53 5. Gen. 35.5. Q. Seeing the promises, of Preserva∣tion from Enemies are such, and so many; what may this teach vs? A. Therefore say yee not a Confede∣racie, to all them, to whom all these peo∣ple shall say a confederacie; neither feare you their feare; nor be afraid, Sancti∣fie the LORD of Hosts himselfe: and let him bee your feare, and let him be your dread: (. 8.12) And strengthen yee the weake hands, and confirme the fee∣ble knees. Say to them that are of feare∣full heart: Be strong: feare not: Isa. 35, 3.1.13. Deut. 20, 3. Num. 14 9. 2 King. 19, 6. oh 4 1. 2 Trust yee in the LORD for euer;
because in the Lord IEHOVAH is ever∣lasting strength: (Isa. 26.4.) It is bet∣ter to trust in the Lord, than to put con∣fidence in Man; it is bettter to trust in the LORD, than to put con∣fidence in Princes: (Psal. 118, 8.) O Is∣rael trust thou in the LORD: hee is their helpe, and their shield. O house of AARON, trust in the Lord; hee is their helpe and their shield: yee that feare the Lord trust in the Lord; hee is their helpe and their shield: Psl. 115 9. 3 Arse, and thresh O Daughter of Zion, for I will make thine horne Iron, and I will make thy hooves Brasse: and thou shalt beate in pieces many people, saith the LORD: (Micha, 4, 13.) Bee of good courage, and let vs play the Men; for our people, and for the Cities of our GOD; and let the Lord doe that which seemeth him good: 2 Sam. 10, 12.
CHAP. XXXIX. Of Deliverance, out of the fore∣said evils. Ob. AH, my LORD; if the Lord bee thus, with vs: Why then is all this come vpon vs? And where bee all his Myracles, which our Fathers told vs of, and said; Did not the LORD de∣liver vs from the Spanish Inuasion, in the yeare, LXXXVIII? But now the LORD hath forsaken the Palatinate, and delivered it into the hand of the SPANIARD? Iudg. 6, 13. 1, Sam. 4, 13. Deuteronomie, 28, 25. Nahum, 3, 11. A. ISRAEL hath sinned, and they haue also transgressed my Covenant, which I commanded them; for they haue taken e∣ven of the accursed thing, &c. There∣fore they could not stand before their ene∣mies: (Ios. 7, 11.) And because they ser∣ved not the LORD their GOD, with ioy∣fulnesse,
and with gladnesse of heart, for the aboundance of all things; therefore doe they serue their enemies, which the Lord hath sent against them, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakednesse, and in the want of all things: Deut. 28.47. Who then gaue IACOB for a spoyle, and Israel to the Robbers? Did not the Lord; hee, against whom they haue sin∣ned? For they would not walke in his wayes, neyther were they obedient vnto his law. Therefore he hath powred vpon them the fury of his anger, and the strength of Battaile, and it hath set them on fire, round about; yet they know not, and it burdeneth them, and they lay it not to heart: (Isa. 42, 24.) Therefore the Emperour before, and the Spaniard be∣hind, haue devoured ISREAL with open mouth; and yet for all this, his anger, is not turned away: but his hand is stretched out still. For the people turneth not to him that smi∣teth them: Neyther doe they seeke the LORD of Hosts: Isa. 9, 12, 65.12.
10, , 4 66, 24. Leuit. 26, 17, 25, 26, 32. 32, 26.36. Ier. 7.30 19.9.2, King. 21, 1. Amos, 6, 8.1, Sam. 28, 19. Lam. 4, 11. Thus when Israel did that which was evill in the sight of the Lord, &c. The an∣ger of the Lord was hote against Israel; and hee delivered them vp into the hands of the spoylers, that spoyled them, &c. so that they could not any longer stand be∣fore their Enemies▪ (Iudg. 2, 11.) Like∣wise the armie of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great Host into their hand. Because they had forsaken the Lord GOD of their Fathers: 2 Chron. 24, 23. Iudg. 3, 7.8.3.12.4.1.2.6.1.13.1.16.20. 1 Chron. 10 13.2.16.7. 1 Sam. 4.2.10. 1 King. 14.25.2.13.1. Exod. 32.25. Q. But haue the sinnes of the Palati∣nate beene so great, as that there is o way left, whereby they may escape the Enemies hands? A. If yet they shall confesse their iniquity
the iniquities of their Fathers; with their trespasse, which they trespassed against me; and that also they haue walked contrary vn∣to me, and that I also haue walked contrary vnto them, &c. If now their vncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they doe accept of the punishment of their iniquity; then will I remember my Covenant with them and also my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember; and I will remember the Land: (euit. 26.40.) And when they shall walke after m, I will roare like a Lion▪ when I shall roare: then the Spaniard and Empe∣rour shall tremble. They shall tremble, as a Brd out of Aegypt, and as a Doue out of the Land of Assyria, and I will place them in their Houses, saith the LORD: (Hos. 11, 10.) Vp there∣fore, and let them sanctifie them∣selues against the morrow: Ios. 7, 13. Psal. 81, 13. Which that you may doe, remember then the King of Aegypt came vp against Ierusalem; because they had transgressed against the LORD, &c. Therefore hee left
them in the hand of Shishak. Wherevp∣on, the Princes of Israel, and the Kings humbling themselues, saying the LORD is righteous. And when the LORD saw, that they humbled them∣selues: the Word of the Lord came to She∣maiah, saying; they haue humbled them∣selues; therefore will I not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not bee powred out vpon IERVSALEM; by the hand of SHISHAK: (2, Chron. 12, 2.) Yea many times did hee deliver them, but they provoked him by their Councell, and were brought low for their iniquities; neverthelesse hee regarded theyr affliction when hee heard theyr crie. And he remembred for them his Cove∣nant, and repented according to the multitude of his Mercies: Psal. 106.43, Thus also will the LORD waite, that he may bee gracious vnto you: and therefore will he be exalted, that hee may haue mercy vpon you; for the LORD
is a GOD of iudgement: (Isa. 30.18.) For he will iudge his people, and he will re∣pent himselfe, concerning his Servants: Psal, 135.14.2, Chron. 15, 3, 33, 9, & 32, 25.1, King. 21, 27. Iona. 3, 10.4.2. Hos. 10, 12. Deut. 4, 29. Iudg. 6, 11, 33 1, Sam. 12.7. Q. What vse are we, and they of the Palatinate to make hereof? A. Therefore feare not: for though yee haue done all this wickednes: yet depart not from following the Lord; but serue the Lord with all your heart, neither turne yee backe; for that should be after vaine things, which cannot profit you, nor deliver you; for they are but vanity: (1, Sam. 12, 20.) And if ye doe turne vnto the Lord, with all your hearts; then put away the strange Gods: and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your heart unto the Lord, and serue him onely, and he will deliver you out of the hand of your Enemies: 1, Sam. 7, 3. Hosea, 13, 1. Lament. 3, 40 41. Deut. 13, 17. Ieremiah, 3, 12.2, Chronicles, 30, 8.
2 Sanctifie you a fast call yee a solemne assembly, gather together the Elders, and all the Inhab tants of the Land into the house of the Lord your GOD, and cry vnto the Lord: (Iol. 1, 14.) And say; take away all iniquitie, and receiue vs gra∣ciously: so will we rnder the Calues of our lips. Ashur shall not saue vs, we will not ride vpon Horses: Neither will we say any more to the worke of our hands; yee are our GODS: For in thee, the Fa∣therlesse find mercy. Hos. 13, 1. O Lod our God other Lords, besides thee haue ruled over vs: but we will re∣member thee onely, and thy Name: Isay, 26, 13. Rise vp Lord, and let thine enemies bee scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee, and returne O Lord, vnto the many thousands of Israel. (Numb. 10, 35.) Or if thou wilt neds afflct vs: let vs now fall into the hand of the Lord; for his Mercies are great, and let vs not fall into the hands of men: (2, Sam. 24.14.) Whose tender mercies are cruell:
Prou. 12 10. Neh. 1, 5 9.32 2 Kng. 9, 5. Psal. 10, 35, 8, 1, 2. 1, Kings, 8, 3. Q. When GOD hath delivered vs om our enemies, what are wee then  doe? A. Awake, awake Deborah: awake, ake; vtter a song: arise Barak thou Son (Aboam. Idg. 5, 12.) Come and be∣ld, the workes of the LORD, what deso∣tions, he hath made in the earth? Hee aketh the Warres to cease vnto the ends of he earth: he breaketh the bow, and cut∣th the speare in sunder: he burneth the hariots in the fire. (Psal. 46, 8.) Sing nto the LORD, for hee hath triumphed riously: the Horse and the rider, hath he rowne into the Sea. The LORD is my rength, and my Song, and he is become my Salvation: hee is my GOD, and I will repare him an habitation: my Fathers GOD, and I will exalt him. The LORD  a man of Warre; the LORD of Hosts this name: (Exod. 15.1.) Who is like nto thee O LORD, amongst the Gods?
who is like thee; glorious in holinesse, feare∣full in praises, doing wonders: (Exod. 15, 11.) Who would not feare thee, O King of Nations? For to thee doth it apper∣taine: for as much as among all the wise men of the Nations, and in all their Kingdomes, there is none like vnto thee: (Ier. 10, 7. Psal. 35, 9.) Thou brin∣gest the Councels of the Heathen to nought, thou makest the devises of the people of none effect: Psal. 33, 10.9, 6. Gen. 14, 20. Psal. 64, 6.66.1, 3, 2, 13.5.18, 35, 30, 1, 31, 7, 76.1, 98 1, 124, 1, 18, 36, 18.46, 28.7, 9, 1.144, 1.140, 7. Isa. 25, 1, 2.52, 9. Psal, 74, 12, 47, 1. 1, Sam. 2, 1.

Were it to bee granted, that the hand of man, may bee eyther too short to reach vs: or too weake to hold vs vnder: yet who can stand when God himselfe, as with an overflowing flood, shall come to iudge terribly the earth? Numb. 24, 23. Isay. 64.3, 2, 19. Ierem. 47, 2. A. The Lord knoweth how to deliver
he godly, out of temptations; and to re∣oue the vniust, vnto the day of Iudgement,  be punished: (2, Pet. 2, .) For behold be name of the Lord commeth from farre; is face is burning, and the burthen thereof  heauy; his lips are full of indignation, d his tongue is a devouring fire. And his irit is a river, that overfloweth vp to the ucke: it divideth a sunder to fanne the Nations, with the fanne, of vanity. But here shall be a song vnto you: as in the ight; when a solemne feast is kept; and ladnesse of heart, as hee that com∣meth with a pipe, to goe vnto the Mount of he LORD, to the mighty one of ISRAEL, (Isa. 30.27.) The LORD all roare out of ZION, and vtter his voice from IERVSALEM; and the Hea∣ns and the Earth shall shake, but the LORD will bee the hope of his peo∣le, and the strength of the children of Is∣el: (Ioel. 3, 16.) When men are cast wne; then they shall say there is a lifting ; and he shall saue the humble person: Iob. 22.29. Ezek. 9, 4, 6. Reuel. 9, 4, 7,

For your eyes haue seene, what the LORD did because of Bal-poor: for all the men that followed Bal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you: but yee that did cleaue vnto the Lord your GOD, are all aliue: every one of you, vntill this day: Deut. 4, 3. Exod. 8, 22, 9.6.9 5.0.23.11.7.12.23.14.27. Heb. 11.31. Ios. 6, 17 6.24. Numb. 14, 12. 2, King. 22.15. Ier. 40.4. Gen. 19.16. Q. What may this teach vs? A. 1. Seeke yee the LORD, all yee meeke of the Earth, which haue wrought his Iudgements; seeke Righeeousnesse, seeke meekenesse: it may bee, yee shall bee hd in the day of the Lors anger: (Zph. 2, 3.) For the eyes of the Lord run too and fro, throughout the whole earth: to shew himselfe strong, in the behalfe of them whose heart is perfect towards him: 2, Chron. 16, 9.
2 Be not afraid of suddaine feare; nor if the dissolation, of the wicked when it mmeth, for the LORD shall be thy con¦fidence, and keepe thy feete from being ta∣en: (Prou. 3.25.) GOD is our refuge, nd strength; a very present helpe in rouble. Therefore doe not feare, though the Earth be remooved, and though the Mountaines bee carried, into the mid∣dest of the Sea. Though the waters thereof are, and be troubled; though the Moun∣ines shake, with the swellings thereof. There is a riuer; the streames whereof, hall make glad, the Citie of GOD: the holy place, of the Tabernacle of the most igh. GOD is in the middest of her; shee all not be moved: God shall helpe her; and that right earely. The Heathen aged: the Kingdomes were moved: he terd his voyce: the Earth melted. The LORD of Hosts is with vs; the GOD f IACOB, is our refuge: Psal. 46, 1. 3 Come my people, enter thou into thy hambers, and shut thy doores about thee; de thy selfe, as it were, for a little mo∣ment,
vntill the indignation be over∣past. For behold the Lord commeth out of his place, to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth, for their iniquitie; the Earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slaine: (Isa. 26, 20.) So that except, the LORD of hostes, had left vs, a very small remnant; wee should haue beene, as SODOME; and wee should haue been, like vnto GOMORRAH: Isa. 1, 9. CHAP XL. Of outward Prosperitie. Ob. NOw am I well apayed in regard of euils feared; but if a man liue many yeares; and the dayes of his yeares, be multiplyed: and yet his Soule bee not satisfied, with good things; I say vnto you, That an vntimely fruit, is bet∣ter than hee: Eccles. 6.3. A. If you serue, and obey him; you
shall spend your dayes in prosperitie, and your yeares in pleasures: (Iob, 36, 11.) Thou shalt decree a thing, and it shall bee established vnto thee; and the light shall shine vpon thy way. (Iob. 22, 28) And you shall reioyce in all that you put your and vnto: and your housholds: where∣in the Lord your GOD hath blessed you: (Deut. 12, 7.) You shall be to me a name of Ioy; a praise, and an honour, before all the Nations of the earth; which shall beare of all the good that I doe vnto you; and they shall feare, and tremble, for all the goodnesse, and for all the prosperitie, that I procure vnto you: (Ier. 33, 9.) And they shall call you Blessed; for you shall be a delight some Land: saith the Lord of hostes: (Mal. 3.12.) Who shall greatly blesse thee in the Land, which hee giveth thee, for an Inheritance, to possesse it. Onely if thou carefully hearken vnto the voyce, of the LORD thy GOD; to ob∣serue; to doe all these Commandements, which I command thee this day: Deut. 15.4.28.2.8. Psal. 128.2.1.1. 2 Chron.
31, 21. Iob, 11, 17. Hosea, 14, 5. For HEZEKIAH cleaving vnto the Lord, and departing not from following him; but keeping his Commandements, which the Lord commanded MOSES; the Lord was with him, and he prospered, whe∣thersoever he went forth: (2. King. 18.6.) The Lord was o with Iehosaphat; be∣cause he walked in the first wayes of his Fa∣ther Dvi, and sought not vnto Baalm, but sought the Lord GOD of his Fathers; and walked in his Commandement, and not after the doings of Israel. Therefore the Lord stablished the Kingdome in his hands. And all Iudah brought to Ieho∣sapha presents; and hee had riches, and honour in abundance: 2, Chron. 17.3. Numb. 24.3. Deut. 2, 7, 40. Psal. 23, 5.6. 1 King. 8 66. Gen. 39, 23. Q. What vse are wee to make of this? A. Pray, saying; Saue now, I beseech thee O Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee send now prosperitie: (Psal. 118, 25.) Let the beauty of the Lord our GOD be vpon vs:
and establish thou the worke of our hands vpon vs; yea the worke of our hands, esta∣blish thou it: Psal. 90.17. 2 Bee thou strong and very couragi∣ous; that thou mayest obserue, to doe ac∣cording to all the Law, which MOSES my servant commanded thee: turne not from it, to the right hand, or to the left; that thou mayst prosper, whethersoever thou goest. This booke of the Law, shall not de∣part out of thy mouth; but thou shalt medi∣tate therein, day and night; that thou may∣est obserue to doe, according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou make thy wayes prosperous, and then thou shalt haue good successe: Ios. 1, 7. Ob. Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee; yet let mee talke with thee of thy Iudgements? Wherefore doth the way of the Wicked, prosper? Wherefore are all they happie, that deale very treacherously? Thou hast planted them; yea, they haue taken roote: they grow: yea, they bring foorth fruit: (Ier. 12, 1.) Behold these are the vngodly;
who prosper in the World; they increase in riches: Psal. 73.12, &c. Ierem. 5, 27. Iob, 12, 6. A. My righteousnesse is like the great Mountaines, and my Iudgements are as a great deepe: (Psal. 36.6.) Yet en∣ter thou into the Sanctuarie of GOD; for then shalt thou vnderstand: Psal. 73, 16. 1 That the wicked doe reioyce, in deed: but not from the heart: (2. Cor. 5.12.) For in their laughter their heart is sorrowfull: (Pro. 14.13.) Of such laughter I said, thou art mad; and of such mirth, what doth it? Eccles, 2.2, 2. They haue their portion in this life: (Psal. 17, 14.) As ESAV the fat∣nesse of the Earth: (Gen. 27 39,) And doe prosper, till the indignation accom∣plished. Dn. 11.36. 3 Better is the end of a thing, than the beginning: (Eccl. 7.8.) For doth not their execellencie, which is in them goe a∣way? (Iob. 4.21.) How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? And how oft
commeth their destruction vpon them? (Iob, 21.17.) Yea the light of the wicked shall be put out; and the sparke of his fire, shall not shine. The light, shall be darke in his Tabernacle, and his candle shall be put t with him. The steps of his strength shall be straitned, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe. (Iob. 18.5.) Yea all the hornes of the wicked shall be broken. Psal. 75.10. Eccl. 5, 15. Pro. 24, 19 20, 4 Knowest thou not this of old: since Man was placed vpon earth; that the tri∣umphing of the wicked is short; and the ioy of the hypocrite but for a moment? (Iob. 20.4.) I haue seene the foolish taking roote; but suddenly I cursed his habitation. (Iob. 5, 3,) How are they brought into desolation as in a moment? As a dreame, when one a∣waketh; so shall GOD despise their image: Psal. 73.19.20. 5 There is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that it will sprout againe, &c. but the wic∣ked man dyeth and where is he? (Iob. 14.7.) He shall returne no more to his house, nei∣ther shall his place know him any more:
A. A faithfull man aboundeth with bles∣sings: (Prou. 28, 20.) Even all these blessings, shall come vpon him, and over∣take him: Deut. 28, 2. 1. He shall inherit the Land, & dwell ther in, for ever: (Psal. 37, 29.) And shall pos∣sesse his possessions: (Obad. 17.) Hee shall be no more plucked out of his Land, which I haue given him, saith the LORD; Amos 9, 15. Leuit. 20.24.25.18. Deut. 11, 24.2, Sam. 7, 10. Ioel 3, 20. Ier. 12, 16. Numb. 14, 8, 24. Iosh. 24, 13.14, 9, 14.14. But the sinners, shall bee destroyed, out of the Land: (Isa. 13.9.) And be brought vnto a Nation; which neyther they, nor theyr Fathers haue knowne: (Deut. 28, 36.) And the LORD shall scatter them, among all people, from the one end of the Earth, even vnto the other: (Deut. 28, 64.) For hee will send vnto them wanderers, that shall cause them to wander; and shall empty their vessels, and breake their bottels: (Ier. 48, 12.) And they shall bee among the
Gentiles, as a vessell, wherein there is no leasure: (Hos. 8, 8.) Then shall the Land enioy her Sabbaths, as long as it ly∣th desolate, and they be in their Enemies Land; even then shall all the land rest, nd enioy her Sabbaths. As long as it lyeth desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in theyr Sabbaths, when they dwelt vpon it: (Leuit. 26, 34.) And it shall come to passe; when yee shall say; where∣fore doth the LORD, our GOD, all these things vnto vs? Then shalt thou answere them: like as yee haue forsaken me, and served strange GODS, in your Land, so shall yee serue strangers, in a Land that is not yours: Ier. 5, 19.24.8.23.7.2, King. 24 9.2, 17.6.7.2.18 9, 10.12. verses 114.15.2, Chron. 6, 20. Numb. 14, 22. 30, 35.37, 20.24. Ezek. 26, 13, 28, 25, 39, 25. Ml. 14, 5. Leuit. 26, 39, 20, 22.18.24. Ier. 6, 8. Ir. 9, 16. Q. Which is the second outward bles∣sing? A. Multitude of people: for who could count the dust of IACOB; and the
number, of the fourth part of ISRAEL? (Numb. 23, 10.) With whom the Land of Aegypt was filled: (Exod. 1, 7.) For they became, as the Starres in Heaven, for multitude: (Dutr. 10, 22.) And were moe and mightyer than their Enemies: Exod. 1, 9.12, 13.2, Sam. 24, 9. Isay. 48, 18. But if thou wilt not obserue, to doe all the words of this Law, &c. Yee shall be left few in number: (Deutron. 28.58.62.) And your high wayes shall bee desolate: Leuit. 26.22. Isa, 13.20. Heare therefore O ISRAEL; and obserue to doe it; that it might bee well with thee, and that yee may increase mightily; as the LORD GOD of your Fathers hath promised thee: Deut. 6, 3.
CHAP. XLII. Of good Government. Q. HOw shall so much people be governed? A. It shall come to passe if yee dili∣gently hearken vnto mee, (saith the LORD, &c.) Then shall there enter, nto the gates of this City, Kings and Prin∣es; sitting vpon the Throne of DAVID; riding in Charets, and Horses; they, and theyr Princes: (Ier. 17, 24.) And your eyes shall see the King in his beauty: (Isay, 33, 17.) And your Nobles shall bee of your selues; and your Gover∣nours shall proceed from the midst of you: Ier. 30, 21, 22, 4. 1, Kings, 2.45. But if you will not hearken vnto the LORD your GOD; yee shall haue cause to say; wee haue no King: because wee feare not the LORD; And what shall a King doe to vs?
(Hos. 10.3.) For from vs, GOD taketh away a King, in his wrath: Hos. 13, 12. Isa. 3, 2. Q. What is the hurt which commeth to a people, by hauing no King, or Ruler, to governe them? A. As when there was no King in ISRAEL: every one, did that which seemed good, in his owne eyes: (Iudg. 17.6.) So there shall bee, as with the people, so with the Priest; as with the Servant, so with the Master: as with the Maid, so with the Mistresse; as with the buyer, so with the seller: as with the Lender: so with the Borrower: as with the taker of vsurie, so with the gi∣ver of vsurie: Isa. 24, 2. Iudg. 18, 18.19.22. Q. What benefit, doth the Church receiue, by the government of Kings? A. When the Earth, and all the Inhabitants thereof are dissolved; he will beare vp the Pillars of it: (Psal. 75.
3.) He is the light of ISRAEL: (2, Sam. 21, 17.) And the beautie there∣of: (2, Sam. 1, 19, 23, 4.) The very breath of your nosthrils, and vnder his shadow, you shall be preserved: (Lam. 4, 20.) And a man shall bee, as a hi∣ing place from the Wind, and a covert from the Tempest: as Rivers of wa∣ter in a dry place: and the shadow of a great Rocke, in a weary land: (Isa. 32, 2.) Kings shall bee your nursing Fathers, and Queenes your nur∣sing Mothers: Isa. 49.23. For the Iewes, and all ISRAEL, dwelt safely: every Man, vnder his Vine, and vnder his Figge-tree, from DAN, even to BEER-SHEBA; all the dayes of SOLOMON: (1, King. 4, 25.) And GOD saved IS∣RAEL, by the hand of IERO∣BOAM: 2, King. 14, 27. 2. Sam 8, 3. Q. By what meanes, doth a King be∣come, so blessed an instrument, of our good?
A. Because by GOD it is that Kings Reigne; (Prou. 8, 15.) He shall giue him another heart: (1, Sam. 10.9.) And hee shall be turned into another man: (1, Sam. 10, 6.) And the wisedome of God, shall be in him, to do Iudgement: 1, King. 3, 28. For it shall be when he sitteth vpon the Throne of his Kingdome that he shall write him a Copie of the Law in a booke. And it shall be with him, and he shall reade there∣in all the dayes of his life; that hee may learne, to feare the Lord his God, to keepe all the words of this Law, and the Statutes to doe them: (Deut. 17.18.) Whereby a divine sentence shall be in the lips of the King, and his mouth transgresseth not in Iudgment: (Prou. 16, 10.) But hee shall raigne in Iustice, and your Princes shall rule in Iudgement: Isa. 32, 1. For David raigned over all Israel, and executed Iudgment, and Iustice among all his people: (1. Chron. 18, 14. And iudged vprightly: (Psal. 75 2.) And that was be∣cause the Lord loved Israel: 1, King. 10.9. 2, Chron. 2, 11.
For as when the Righteous are in autho∣rity the people reioyce, so when the wicked beare rule, the people mourne: Prou. 29, 2.4. Prou. 28, 15, 16.29, 12. Eccl. 10 17. 1, Sam. 28, 3, 2, 5.12. 1, Kings, 15.1, 2, 10, 28, 2, 14, 5, 6, 2, 23, 3. 2, Chron. 14, 3, 29, 3, 34, 3, 2, 36.22. 2 Because the worke will bee too heauie for one man; neyther is he able to per∣forme it alone: (Exod. 18, 18.) He, af∣er the wisedome of his GOD, that is in his heart, shall set vp Magistrates, and Iudges; which may iudge all the people: (Ezra, 7, 25.) And place such over them, s are able men; such as feare GOD; en of truth, hating covetousnesse; to bee ulers of thousands, and Rulers of hun∣dreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of nnes; to iudge the people at all seasons: Exod. 18, 21. And the King shall charge them, say∣g; Thus shall yee doe, in the feare of he LORD faithfully and with a perfect eart. So that whatsoever cause shall
come to you of your Brethren, that dwell in their Cities, &c. You shall warne them, that they trespasse not against the LORD: (2, Chron. 19, 9.) Yee shall not wrest the Iudgement of the poore in his ouse: (Exod. 23, 6.) But yee shall iusti∣fie the Righteous, and condemne the wicked: (Deut. 25.1.) Which that yee may the better doe, yee shall take no gift; for the guift blindeth the wise, and per∣verteth the words of the Righteous: (Exod. 23.8.) Neither shall you respect the person of the poore, nor honour the person of the mighty: (Leuit. 15.19.) You shall take heed what yee doe, for yee iudge not for men, but for the LORD; who is with you in the Iudgement. Where∣fore now let the feare of the Lord bee vpon you. Take heed and doe it, for there is no iniquitie with the Lord our God, nor re∣spect of persons, nor taking of guifts: (2, Chron. 19.6.) Thus shall you iudge the people, at all seasons: and it shall be, that e∣very great matter you shall bring vnto me; but every small matter, you shall iudge:
so shall it be easier for me, when you shall beare the burthen with mee: Exod. 18.22. 1, Sam. 7, 15, 16. Deut. 16, 19, 1, 17. Ier. 22 3.21, 12. Amos, 5, 15. Micha, 3.1. Psal. 82, 2. Prou. 18.5. 2, Sam. 23, 3. Q. What good shall come to vs by these substitutes in Gouernment? A. As the Mountaines shall bring peace to the people; so the little Hils by righteousnes: (Psal. 72, 3.) For God led his people like a flocke, by the hand of Mo∣ses, and Aaron: (Psal. 77.20.) And Mor∣decay sought the wealth of his people, and spake peace vnto all his seed: Esth. 10.3. Psal. 72.4. Iob. 29.12. 2, King. 8, 6. Q. What may the promise of good Rulers teach vs? A. To pray, saying; Let the Lord, the GOD of the spirits of all flesh set a man ver the Congregation, which may goe out before them, and which may goe in before them, and which may leade them out, and which may bring them in; that the. Congregation of the LORD e not as Sheepe, which haue no Shep∣heard:
(Numb. 27.16.) But that wee may lead a quiet, and peaceable life, in all Godlinesse, and Honestie: 1, Tim. 2, 2. Q. When wee haue a King, and o∣thers sent of him to gouerne vs, what is required of vs? A. 1 Feare the LORD in truth and with all your hearts; because if you shall doe wickedly, you shall bee consumed, both you and your King: 1, Sam. 12.24.25. 2 I exhort that supplications and pray∣ers, with giving of thankes bee made for Kings, and for all that are in authori∣ty: (1, Tim. 2, 1.) Wherein because the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord; as the Rivers of water, he turneth it whether∣soever he will: (Prou. 21, 1.) Pray, giue the King thy Iudgments O Lord, and thy Righteousnes vnto the Kings Sonne: that so he may iudge the people with righteous∣nes and the poore with Iudgment: (Psal. 72, 1.) And as thou hast set thy Servant over thy people, giue him an vnderstan∣ding
heart, to iudge thy people, that he may discerne betweene good, and bad; for who is able to iudge this so great a people? (1, King. 3, 9) And take away the wic∣ked from the King, that his Throne may be established in righteousnes: Prou. 25 4. Blesse Lord his substance, and accept the worke of his hands; smite thorough the loynes of them that rise against him and of them that hate him, that they rise not a∣gaine: (Deut. 33, 11.) Let him abide for ever before thee. O prepare mercie, and truth which may preserue him; so will I sing praises vnto thy name for ever: (Psal, 61, 7.) And the King also shall ioy in thy strength, O LORD, and in thy salva∣tion, how greatly shall he reioyce? Psal. 21.1, 80, 17. 1, King. 8, 25. 3 Honour the King: (1, Pet. 2, 17.) A did ARAVNAN who when hee saw the King comming towards him; he went out, and bowed himselfe before the King, on his face, on the ground: (2, Sam. 24.20) And be not hasty to goe out of his sight: Eccl. 8, 3.
4 Let them bee had in double honour: (1, Tim. 5.17.) For, for this cause pay you tribute also; for they are GODS Mi∣nisters, attending continually vpon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute is due, custome to whom Custome: (Ro, 13.6.) Even vnto CAESAR, the things that are CAESARS: Math. 22.21. 5 Submit your selues vnto every ordi∣nance of man for the Lords sake: (1, Pet. 2, 13.) And let every Soule bee Subiect vnto the higher powers; for there is no power, but of GOD: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of GOD; and they that resist shall re∣ceiue to themselues damnation. For Ru∣lers are not a terrour to good workes, but to the evill Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Doe that which is good, and hou shalt haue praise of the same; for ee is the Minister of GOD, to thee for good: (Rom. 13.1.) For in the light of
the Kings Countenance is life, and his savour is as a Cloud of the latter raine: (Prou. 16, 15.) And as the dew vpon the grasse; but his wrath is as the roaring of the Lyon: (Prou. 19, 12.) And as the Messenger of death: hee that is wise will pacifie it: Prou. 16, 14, 20, 2 Math. 22.21. I counsell thee therefore to keepe the Kings commandement, but yet according to the oath of GOD. And stand not in an evill thing, for he doth whatsoever plea∣seth him. Where the word of a King is, there is power; and who may say vnto him, what doest thou: Eccl. 8, 2. Numb. 27, 20. Ob. How comes it to passe, that so many thousands in a Kingdome, should subiect themselues vnto the government of one man? A. As in Iudah, the hand of GOD was to giue them one heart to doe the comman∣dement of the King, and of the Princes: (2, Chron. 30.12.) So doth hee still bow the hearts of all Men; Even as the heart of one man vnto him:
(2, Sam. 19.14.) Whereby all that hee commandeth, they will doe; whether soe∣ver he sendeth them, they wil goe; accor∣ding as they hearkened vnto MOSES, so will they hearken vnto him: Iosh. 1, 16.4, 14. Q But is this the case of every King, to haue all his people in subie∣ction? A. No: for the Children of Belial say of theyr King, how shall this man saue vs? And doe despise him, and will bring him no presents: (1, Sam. 10.27.) And doe despise dominion, and speake evill of digni∣ties: (Iud. 8.) Saying, Wee will not haue this man rule ouer vs: (Luk. 19, 14.) As Sheba the Sonne of Bichri, who blew a trumpet, and said, we haue no part in Dauid, neither haue wee inheritance in the Sonne of Iesse: 2, Sam. 20.1. Num. 12.1. Q. What is the danger, of such Re∣bels, against their Soueraigne? A. Whosoever will not doe the Law of the King, let iudgment hee executed spee∣dily
vpon him; whether it be vnto death,  to banishment, or to confiscation of oods, or to Imprisonment: (Ezra, 7, 26) And if the sonnes of ZERVIAH bee too ard for him, the Lord shall reward the doer of evill, according to his wickednesse: 2, Sam. 3, 39. Thus MIRIAM, for speaking against MOSES, became leprous, as white as snow. (Numb. 12.10.) And the Earth swal∣lowed vp DATHAN and ABIRAM, with ll that they had: (Numb. 16.32.) For they doe not reiect man, but GOD, that he should not raigne over them: 1. Sam. 8.7. 2. Sam. 16.5. Numb. 16.49. Iudg. 9.53.9.16.9.10.11. Q. What may this teach vs? A. To pray, saying; The LORD forbid, that I should stretch forth my hand, against the LORDS anointed: 1. Sam. 26.11. 2 Curse not the King; no not in thy thoughts; and curse not the rich in thy bed chamber: for a bird of the ayre, shall carry thy voyce, and that which hath wings, shall tell the matter: Eccles. 10.20.
Ob. But shall euen he, that hateth right, gouerne? (Iob, 34.17.) For I saw vnder the Sunne; the place of Iudgement, that wickednesse was there; and the place of righteousnesse, that iniquitie was there: (Eccles. 3.16.) Her Rulers doe love with shame, give yee: (Hosea, 4.18.) Shall the throne of iniquitie, haue fellowship with thee, which frameth mischiefe, by a Law? Psalm. 94.20.82.5. Eccles. 10.5. Zephan. 3.3. Micha. 3.9.1. Sam. 8.11. Isa. 3.12.10. 1. Habac. 1.2.1.13. Nehem. 5.15. 2. Kings, 24.4. Amos. 6.12.5.7. Isa. 29.21. Micha. 3.2. A. EPHRAIM is oppressed, and bro∣ken in iudgement; because hee willingly walked after the commandement: (Hos. 5.11.) They make the King glad with their wickednesse, and the Princes with their lyes: (Hos. 7.3.) Not∣withstanding, to subuert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not: Lam. 3.36.
Wherefore if thou seest, the oppression  the poore, and violent perverting of dgement, and Iustice in a Province; rvell not at the matter: for hee that  higher, than the highest, regardeth; and re be higher than they: (Eccles. 5.8.)  GOD standeth in the congregation of  mighty; hee iudgeth among the Gods: Psalm. 82.1.) Hee doth execute the dgement, of the Fatherlesse and Wid∣: (Deut. 10, 18.) And shall iudge  Righteous, and the Wicked: for there  time there, for every purpose, and  every worke: (Eccles. 3, 17.) when e LORD will enter into Iudge∣nt, with the ancients of his peo∣, and the Princes thereof: (Isa. 3, 4.) And will powre out his wrath, pon them like Water: (Hosea. 5, 10.) And breake them with a rodde of I∣, and dash them in peeces like a tters vessell: Psalm. 2, 9. Deuteron. 7, 19. Ecclesiast. 4, 13. Hosea, 5, 5.  Sam. 28, 17. 2, Chron. 5, 27. Mi∣cha,
3, 12. Amos, 5, 12. Dan. 4, 25, 33. 1, King. 20, 42. Psal. 82, 6. Isa. 3, 15. Q. If this bee the condition of Ru∣lers, and of men in Authoritie, in the commission of Iniustice; what vse are they to make of it? A. 1 Bee wise now therefore, O yee Kings: be instructed yee Iudges of the earth: Serue the LORD with feare, and reioyce with trembling. Kisse the Sonne, least hee be angry, and yee perish from the way; when his wrath is kindled, but a little; blessed are all they that put their trust in him: Psalm. 2, 10.29, 1. Amos, 5, 24. Prou. 20, 28. 1, Kings, 2, 46. 2 Rob not the Poore, because hee is poore; neither oppresse the Afflicted in the gate: for the LORD will pleade their cause; and spoyle the soule of them that spoyled them: (Prou. 22, 22.) Deliver them that are drawne vnto death, and those that are ready to bee slaine: Prou. 24, 11, 12. Ob. If notwithstanding, what is said,
such should continue, to oppresse; I uch feare, what the end thereof may ee? A. If you bee willing, and obedient, Isa. 1, 19.) violence shall no more bee urd in thy Land; wasting, nor destructi∣ within thy borders: (Isa. 60, 18.) For will turne my hand vpon thee; and pure∣ purge away thy drosse, and take away l thy tinne. And I will restore thy Iud∣s as at first, and thy Councellers as at the eginning: afterwards thou shalt be cal∣ed the Citie of Righteousnesse, the faith∣ll Citie: Isa. 1, 25. Ob. I now see cause enough; and I ould bee contented, to submit my selfe nto my Soueraigne, and his substitutes  the Common-weale; this onely trou∣leth mee, that I doe yet remaine in the ondition of a Seruant? A. Let every man abide in the same ocation, wherein hee was called. Art hou called being a Servant? Care not for ; but yet if thou mayest bee made free, se it rather: for hee that is called in
the LORD, being a Servant, is the Lords free-man; likewise also, he that is called being free, is CHRISTS servant. 1, Cor. 7, 20. Q. What then ought to bee our ca∣riage towards our Masters? A. Let as many servants as are vnder the yoake, count their owne Masters, wor∣thy of all honour; that the Name of GOD, and his Doctrine, bee not blasphea∣med: 1, Tim. 6, 1. 2 Servants bee obedient vnto them that are your Masters, according to the flesh, with feare, and trembling; in singlenesse of your heart, as vnto CHRIST: Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of GOD from the heart; with good-will, doing service, as to the LORD, and not to Men: Ephes 6, 5. Mth. 8, 9. Ob. I, and my Master, are both of one brotherhood in CHRIST; why then should I be subiect vnto him? A. They that haue beleeving Masters, let them not despise them, because they
are Brethren; but rather doe them ser∣ce: because they are faithfull, and loved, partakers of the benefit: 1, im. 6, 2. Q. How farre forth are we to be sub∣ct vnto them? A. Let servants be subiect to their own sters, and please them in all things; not swering againe: not purloyning, but ewing all good fidelity, that they may a∣urne the doctrine of GOD, our Sauiour  all things: Tit. 2 9. 2 Be subiect not onely to thee good, and ntle, but also to the froward. For this  thanke-worthy, if a man for conscience ward GOD endure griefe, suffering rongfully. For what glory is it, if when  man bee buffetted for his faults hee shall ike it patiently? But if when yee doe ll, and suffer for it, yee take it pati∣tly, this is acceptable with GOD. For euen herevnto were yee called; be∣use CHRIST also suffered for vs, lea∣ing vs an example, that yee should follow s steps: 1. Pet. 2.18.
Q. This is a very hard taske imposed; but what good shall I reape thereby? A. As hee that keepeth the Fig-tree shall eate the fruit thereof; so he that wai∣teth on his Master shall bee honoured: (Prou. 27, 18.) A wise Servant, shall haue rule over a Sonne, that causeth shame, and shall haue part of the inhe∣ritance, among the Brethren: (Prou. 17, 2.) Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall hee re∣ceiue of the Lord, whether hee be bond or free: Ephes. 6, 8. Ob. But shall my Master alwayes bee let alone in his rigour? A. No: for GOD who seeth thine affliction, and the labour of thy hands will rebuke thy Master, as hee did LABAN: (Gen. 31, 42.) Saying vnto him, and such as hee is, yee Masters doe the same things vnto them, forbearing threatning; know∣ing that your Master also is in Heaven: neither is there respect of persons with him. Ephes. 6, 9. Gen. 31, 24. Eccles. 7, 21. Iob, 31, 13. Deut. 15, 13, 14, 18.
CHAP. XLIII. Of Peace, Food, and Health. Q. WHich are the fourth, fifth, and sixth particular utward blessings? A. The fourth is peace. The meeke hall delight themselues with the abundanc of Peace: (Psal. 37, 11.) For GOD maketh Peace in their borders: (Psal. 147.14.) And they shall lye downe, and none hall make them afraid: (Leuit. 26.6.) And they shall know that their Tabernacle s Peace: (Iob. 5.24) For when he giveth Peace, who can make Trouble? Iob. 34, 9. Psal. 48, 8 9. Isay. 33, 20, 48, 18, Iam, 3, 18. Thus the LORD gave DAVID rest, ound about, from all his enemies: (2, Sam. , 1.) And Iudah and Israel dwelt safe∣y; every man vnder his Vine, and vnder is Figge tree from Dan, even to Beer∣heba, all the dayes of SOLOMON:
(1, King. 4, 25.) So that there was nei∣ther Adversary, nor evill occurrent: 1, King. 5, 4.2, Chron. 20, 30, 2, 15.15. Iosh. 23, 1. Acts. 9.31. But there is no peace, saith my GOD, to the wicked: (Isay, 57, 21.) To him that went out, nor to him that commeth in; but great vexations were vpon all the In∣habitants of their Countries: 2, Chron. 15 5. Zach. 8, 10. Ier. 19.9. Isay, 48.22, 9, 21. The fifth outward blessing is Food. Hee giveth meate vnto them that feare him: (Psal. 111.5.) Hee will abundant∣ly blesse their provision, and satisfie their poore with bread: (Psal. 132, 15.) Corne shall make the young men cheerefull, and new Wine the Maides: (Zachariah, 9, 17.) Your threshing shall reach vnto the Vintage, and the Vintage shall reach vnto the seeds time, and you shall eate your bread to the full: (Leuit. 26, 5.) And you shall eate of the old store, and bring foorth the old store, because of the new: Leuit. 26, 5, 10.
For of IOSEPH it was said; Bles∣sed of the LORD is his Land, for the sweetnesse of Heaven, for the dew, and for the depth lying beneath, and for the sweet increase of the Sunne, and for the sweet increase of the Moone, and for the sweetnesse of the ancient Moun∣taines, and for the sweetnesse of the old Hilles, and for the sweetnesse of the Earth, and the abundance thereof, and the good will of him that dwelt in the Bush: Deutr. 33, 13, 11.14.28.4, 7, 13. Isa. 32, 20.30, 23. Psal. 144, 13.104.13. Ier. 31, 12. Gen. 9.3.27.28. Zach. 8, 11.12.10. 1. Ezek. 34, 26. Prou. 27, 18.1, King. 8, 35. Ioel. 3, 18. Ob. I am notwithstanding much pin∣ched with hunger, and thirst, and know not where to be satisfied? A. When the poore, and needie seeke water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will heare thē, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open Riuers in high places, and Foun∣taines in the midst of the vallies, I wil make the
Wildernesse a Poole of water, and the dry Land springs of water: (Isa. 41, 17.) The The Righteous shall not be ashamed in evill times, and in the dayes of Famine they shall be satisfied: Psal. 37, 19. Prou. 10.3. Psal. 65, 9.107, 35. Hos. 2, 21. Mal. 3.11. Deut. 10, 18. Isa. 62 8 9 58, 11.65.21, 22. Ioel. 2, 21. GOD was the GOD, that fed Ia∣cob all his life-time: (Gen. 48, 16.) And rained bread also from Heaven: (Exod. 16, 4, 18.) Wherewith the Isra∣elites were fed forty yeares, vntill they came vnto a Land inhabited: (Exod. 15, 35.) Water also was given vnto Samp∣son out of the iaw bone of an Asse: (Iudg. 15.19.) And to the Israelites out of a Rocke in abundance: Numbers, 20, 11. Ruth, 1, 6.1, King. 17, 16.2, 7, 18, 3, 17, Deut. 32, 13. Gen. 21, 19.26, 12. Exod. 23, 25. Q. What may this teach vs? A. Therefore take no thought for your life, what yee shall eate, or what yee shall drinke. Is not the life more
than meate? Behold the fowles of the Ayre, for they sow not, neyther doe they reape, nor gather into Barnes, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are yee not much better than they? &c. Therefore take no thought, saying; what shall wee eate? Or what shall wee drinke? For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke. For your Heaven∣ly Father knoweth that ye haue need of all these things. But seeke yee first the Kingdome of GOD, and his Righteousnesse, and all these things shall bee added vnto you: Math. 6.25. Ioel, 2, 21. Numbers, 11, 22. 2 Bee glad then, yee Children of ZION, and reioyce in the LORD, your GOD; because hee hath given you, the former Raine, moderately: (Ioel, 2 23.) For are there any among the vani∣ties of the Gentiles, that can cause raine? Or can the Heavens giue showers? Art not thou he, O LORD our GOD? therefore wee will waite vpon thee; for
thou hast made all these things: Ier. 14, 22. Blesse the LORD, O my Soule; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: (Psal. 103.5.) And let the people praise thee, O GOD, let the people praise thee; then shall the earth yeeld her increase, and GOD, even our owne God shall blesse vs? Psal. 67, 5. Deut. 8, 10. 3. Because when goods increase, they are increased that eate them: (Eccl. 5.11.) And because it is good, and comely to eate, and to drinke: (Eccles. 5, 18, 3.12.3.13.22.) Therefore goe your wayes, eate the fat, and drinke the sweet, and send portions to them, for whom nothing is prepared: Neh. 8, 10. 4 Trust in the Lord, and doe good; for verily thou shalt be fed: (Psal, 37, 3.) O feare the LORD, yee his Saints, for there is no want to them that feare him. The young Lyons doe lacke, and suffer hunger; but they that seeke the LORD shall not want any good thing: Psalme, 34, 9. Ieremiah, 11, 4.
Deuteronomie, 6.10.8, 11.12. For the LORD will not suffer the Soule of the Righteous to famish, though e cast away the substance of the wicked: (Prou. 10.3.) The Righteous eateth to the satisfying of his Soule; but the belly of the wicked shall want: (Prou. 13, 25. Isa. 65, 13.) And they shall wander abroad for bread, saying where is it? (Iob. 15.23.) And when I haue broken the staffe of bread, tenne women shall bake their bread n one oven, and they shall deliver their bread by weight; and they shall eate, and ot be satisfied, &c. Yea they shall eate the flesh of their Sonnes, and the flesh of their Daughters shall they eate: Leuit. 26 26, &c. Prou. 13, 2.10, 5, 28, 19. Amos, 5, 16. Deuteron. 11, 16, 28, 24.28.17.18, 28, 38. Isa. 1, 19, 20. Ioel. 1, 4. Leuit. 26, 16.19, 20. verses. Ier. 7, 19.20. Hos. 4, 1. Psal. 106, 14.15. Numb. 11.33. Luk. 6, 25. Iob, 20.23. Exo∣dus, 7.20.9, 25.8, 3, 10.15. Hosea, 8, 7. Ob. You seeme to restraine this hunger-bitten Iudgement to the wicked
Whereas the contrary hath prooued true; As of the rich man, and Lazarus: Luk. 16, 19. &c. A. There is a vanitie, which is done vpon the Earth; that there bee iust men, vnto whom it happeneth according to the worke of the wicked: againe there bee wic∣ked men, to whom it happeneth accor∣ding to the worke of the Righteous: Eccl. 8, 14.7.15. But as for mee, I haue beene young, and now am old, yet haue I not seene the Righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread: (Psal. 37, 25.) And although the Figge-tree shall not blossome, neither shall fruit bee in the Vines: the labour of the Oliue shall faile, and the Fields shall yeeld no meate, the flocke shall bee cut off from the Fold, and there shall bee no heard in the Stalles; yet I will reioyce in the LORD; I will ioy in the GOD of my Salvation: (Habakuc, 3, 17, 18.) As it is writ∣ten: (Deuteron. 8, 3.) Man shall not
liue by Bread onely, but by every word, that oceedeth out of the mouth of GOD: Math. 4 4. Q Which is the sixt outward bles∣ng GOD will bestow vpon vs? A. I will (saith GOD,) put none of he diseases vpon thee, which I haue rought vpon the Egyptians; for I am he LORD, that healeth thee: (Exod. 15, 26.) Thou shalt not bee afraid, for he terrour by night; nor for the arrow hat flieth by day; nor for the Pestilence that walketh in darknesse; nor for the de∣struction that wasteth at noone day. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and tenne thousand at thy right hand; but it shall ut come nigh thee: Psal. 91, 5. Ob. Notwithstanding the Lord doth follow me with grieuous sicknesse. A. The LORD will strengthen thee, vpon thy bed of languishing; he will make ll thy bed in thy Sicknesse: (Psal. 41, 3.) Thy flesh shall bee fresher than a Childes; hou shalt returne to the dayes of youth: (Iob, 33, 25.) For hee maketh sore, and
bindeth vp; hee woundeth, and his hand makes whole: Iob, 5, 18. Deut. 7, 15.2, King. 20, 4, 5, 5, 10. Isa. 38, 21. Iob, 42, 10. Math. 8, 7. Luk. 17, 19, 18, 42. Q. Vpon what condition shall this Promise be made good? A. That thou feare the LORD, and depart from evill; for this shall be Health to thy navell, and marrow to thy bones: (Prou. 3, 7, 8.) Incline thine care vnto his sayings, &c. For they are life vnto those that finde them, and health to all theyr flesh: Prou. 4, 20. Exod. 15, 26. Q. What then is the danger of li∣uing in Sinne? A. It shall come to passe, if thou wilt not hearken vnto the voyce of the LORD thy GOD, to obserue, and doe all his Commandements, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, &c. The LORD shall make the Pestilence cleaue vnto thee, vntill hee haue consumed thee from off the Land. The LORD shall smite thee with a Consumption, and with a
feaver, and with an inflamation: Deut. 15, 21. Moreouer, hee will bring vpon thee the diseases of Aegypt, and which thou  afraid of; and they shall cleaue vn∣hee. Also every Sicknesse, and eue∣lague, which is not written in  booke of the Law; them will the RD bring vpon thee, vntill thou bee troyed: Deut. 28, 60.27, 35. verses. it. 26, 16, 25. Exod. 9, 9.2, Chron.  15. Examples: 2, Chron. 21, 18.26, 19. King. 5, 26.2, 1.3.4, 17. Psal. 78, 50. m. 46, 11. CHAP. XLIIII. Of Strength, Beauty, and Wisdome. WHat other Temporall bles∣sing will GOD bestow vp∣ his Children?
A. Hee giveth power to the faint, an to them that haue no might hee increase Strength. Even the youths shall fain and the young men shall vtterly fall; b they that wayt vpon the LORD, shall r new theyr strength. They shall mount v with wings as Eagles, and they shall runn and not bee wearie; and they shall walk and not faint: Isa. 40, 29. Thus MOSES being one hundred an twenty yeares old, his eyes were not dimm nor his naturall force abated: (Deut. 34 7.) IOSHVA also, at Eightie and fiue yeares, was as strong for Warre, both to g out, and to come in, as when MOSE sent him to search the Land: (Ios. 14 11.) It is GOD also that girdeth mee with strength, &c. Hee teacheth my han to warre, so that a Bow of steele is broke by mine arme: Psalm. 18, 32, 34. Iud 14, 6.15, 14, 16, 3.16, 12, 16, 14.16, 3 Num. 23, 22. Q. What may this teach vs? A. Therefore ascribe yee strength vn GOD; his Excellencie is over Israel, an h
strength is in the Clouds. The God of el is hee also that giveth strength,  power to his people: blessed be GOD: l. 68, 34. Q. What is the case of such as doe a∣e their strength? A. Those that imagine mischiefe a∣st GOD, who had bound, and streng∣ed their armes: (Hos. 7, 15.) Their ngth shall be hunger bitten, and de∣ction shall bee ready at their side. It ll devoure the strength of their skinne,  the first borne of Death shall de∣re their strength: Iob, 18, 12, 13. Q. Which are the eighth and ninth thly Blessings? A. The eighth is Beautie. For the ORD of hostes shall bee for a crown  Glory, and for a Diadem of beauty vnto  people: (Isa. 28, 5.) And will giue  to them beauty for ashes: (Isa. 61, 3.) d bee as the dew vnto Israel; they shall  as the Lillie, and fasten their rootes he trees of Libanon: Hos. 14, 6. Psal. 13.
Thus IOSEPH was a goodly perso and well favoured: (Gen. 39, 6) S was also MOSES: (Exod. 2, 2.) A DAVID was ruddie, and withall of Be¦tifull countenance, and goodly to looke t (1, Sam. 16, 12.) SARA also was ve faire: Genes. 12, 14 24, 16.29, 1 Esther, 2, 7. Notwithstanding the LORD seeth  as man seeth: (1, Sam. 16, 7.) For fauo is deceitfull, and beauty is vaine; but Woman that feareth the Lord shee shall  praised: Prou. 31, 30. The ninth is Wisdome. For DAVI went out whither SAVL sent him, a behaved himselfe wisely: (1, Sam. 1 5.) And that in all his wayes: (1, Sa 18, 14.) Yea, with more Wisdome, th all the servants of SAVL: 1, Sam. 1 30. Deut. 34, 9. Psalm. 105, 22. Eccl 1, 16. And vnto SALOMON was given wise, and vnderstanding heart; so  eyther before, or after him, there was no like him: (1, King. 3, 12.) For there w
Wisdome of GOD in him, to doe Iudge∣ent: 1, King. 3, 28.1.10, 1, 24.2, Sam. , 20.2, 20.16, 22. Moreouer, see saith GOD, I haue cal∣d by name Bezaleel, and I haue filled him ith the spirit of GOD in Wisdome, and nderstanding, and in Knowledge, and in ll manner of workmanship, to devise cun∣ing workes: (Exod. 31, 2.) And haue put  his heart that hee may teach Aholiab: Exod. 35, 34.30, 30. And in all matters of Wisedome, and nderstanding, that the King inquired of DANIEL, HANANIAH, MASHAEL, and AZARIAH, he found them tenne times better, than all the Magicians, and Astro∣ogers that were in all his Realme: Dan. 1, 0.2, 14, 5, 12. And doth the Plow-man, plow all the ay to sow? Doth he open, and breake the lods of his ground? When hee hath made laine the face thereof, doth hee not cast broad the Fitches, and scatter the ummin, and cast in the principall heat, and the appointed Barley, and the
Rye in their place? For his God doth in∣struct him to discretion, and doth teach him: Isa. 28, 24. Q. Is humane Wisdome of any great worth? A. Wisdome maketh a mans face to shine: (Eccles. 8, 1.) And is good with an inheritance; and by it there is profit to them, that see the Sunne: (Eccles. 7, 11.) For it strengtheneth the wise, more than tenne mightie men, which are in the Citie: (Eccles. 7, 19.) For there was a little Ci∣tie, and few men within it, and there came a great King against it and besiedged it, and built great bulwarkes against it; now there was found in it a poore wise man; and hee by his wisedome delivered the Citie. Then said I, Wisedome is better then Strength: Eccles. 9, 14, 9, 16, 18. verses. Q. What then is the worth of Wisdome, more than of Folly? A. As the light is more excellent than darknesse: (Eccles. 2, 13.) For the Wis∣dome of the prudent is to vnderstand his
way; but the folly of Fooles is deceit: (Prou. 14.8.13, 16.) A wise mans heart is at his right hand; but a fooles heart is at his left: (Eccles. 10, 2.) The words of a wise mans mouth are gracious; but the lips of a foole will swallow vp himselfe. The beginning of the words, of his mouth, is foolishnesse, and the end of his talke, it mischievous madnesse: (Eccles. 10, 12. Prou. 15, 2.) Every wise woman also buil∣deth her house; but the foolish plucketh it downe with her hands: Prou. 14, 1. Q. What may this concerne the children of Wisdome? A. That they blesse the GOD of hea∣ven, saying; Blessed bee the name of God forever, and ever; for Wisdome, are his. Hee giveth wisedome vnto the wise, and knowledge to them, that know vnderstan∣ding. He revealeth the deepe, and secret things, hee knoweth what is in the dark∣nesse, and the light dwelleth with him: Dan. 2, 19. Q. What is the contrary judgement denounced against the wicked?
A. The LORD shall smite them with madnesse, and blindnesse; whereby they shall grope at noone-dayes, as the blind gropeth in darknesse, and they shall bee mad, for the sight of their eyes, which they shall see: (Deut. 28.28. Iob, 5.14.) And they shall haue no delight in vnderstanding; but that their heart may bee discouered: Prou. 18.2. Isa. 29.14. Ob. The councell of ANITOPHEL, though wicked, was as if a man had in∣quired at the oracle of GOD: (2. Sam. 16.23.) And the men of this world are in their generation, wiser than the chil∣dren of light: Luk. 16.8. A. 1 Therefore behold the LORD will doe a marueilous worke in this people; even a marveilous worke, and a wonder; for the wisedome of their wise men shall pe∣rish, and the vnderstanding of their pru∣dent men, shall bee hid: (Isa. 29, 14.) For the Lord turned the counsell of AI∣TOPHEL into foolishnesse: (2, Sam. 15, 31, 17, 14.) And so hee taketh all such
wise men in their owne craftinesse and the counsell of the froward is carried head∣long: Iob, 5.13. 2 As dead flyes cause the oyntment of the Apothicarie to send foorth a stinking savour; so doth a little follie him that i in reputation for Wisdome: Eccles. 10, 1. 3 Such are foolish, they haue not knowne mee (saith the LORD,) they are sottis children, they haue none vnderstanding; they are wise to doe evill; but to doe good, they haue no knowledge: (Ierem. 4, 22.) For they want the feare of GOD, which is the beginning of true Wise∣dome: (Psalm. 111, 10.) And they haue reiected the Word of the LORD, and what Wisedome is in them? Ierem. 8, 9.
CHAP. XLV. Of Wealth. Q. WHat is the tenth Temporall blessing? A. Wealth, and riches also, shall bee in the house of the man that feareth the LORD: (Psal. 112, 3.) Hee shall lay vp gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir, as the stones of the brookes. Yea, the Al∣mighty shall bee his defence, and he shall haue plenty of silver: (Iob, 22, 24.) For brasse, I will bring him gold, and for iron, I will bring silver; and for wood brasse, and for stones iron: Isa. 60, 17. Prou. 8, 21. Thus ABRAHAM was rich in Cat∣tle, in Silver, and Gold: Gen. 13, 2, 6. verses, 26, 13.30, 43.32, 10. Iob, 1, 3, 42, 2. Q. When GOD hath fulfilled this promise vpon any, what is to bee done?
A. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded; that they doe good, and be rich in good workes: 1. Tim. 6.17. 2 Therefore thou shalt remember the LORD thy GOD; for it is he that gi∣veth thee power to get wealth: (Deut. 8.18.) And it is his blessing that maketh rich, and addeth no sorrow with it: Prou. 10.22. Q. Doth not GOD, in this kind, blesse the wicked, liuing wickedly; as well as his owne children, in the vse of lawfull meanes? A. In all labour there is profit, but the talke of the lippes tendeth onely to pover∣tie: (Prou. 14, 23.) Hee that oppres∣seth the Poore to increase his riches, and hee that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want: (Prou. 22, 16.) Hee that hasteth to bee rich hath an evill eye, and considereth not that povertie shall come vpon him: (Prou. 28, 22.) Hee that lo∣veth pleasure shall bee a poore man, and he that loveth Wine, and oyle shall not be
rich: Prou. 21, 17.24, 30.21, 5, 10, 4, 13, 11, 12, 27. Ob. I doe obserue the wicked to thriue more than many of GODS owne chil∣dren. A. Better is a little with righteousnesse, than great revenues without right: (Pro. 16, 8.) For treasures of wickednesse pro∣fit not: (Prou. 10.2.) And what good is there to the owners thereof, saue the be∣holding of them with their eyes? Eccles. 5, 11. Prou. 12, 27.19, 22. 2 As in the house of the righteous is much treasure, so in the revenues of the wicked is trouble: (Prou. 15.6.) There∣fore much better is a little with the feare of the LORD, than great treasure, and trouble therewith: Prou. 15, 16. Eccles. 5, 19, 3, 12, 13. verses. 8 15. Psal. 39, 6. 3 There is an evill which I haue seene vnder the Sunne; namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt: (Eccles. 5.13.) Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterward his mouth shall bee filled with gravell: (Prou. 20, 17.) The increase
of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of Gods wrath: (Iob, 20, 28.) when the rust of their Gold shall bee a witnesse against them, and shall eate their flesh as it were fire: Iam. 5.3. Prou. 28, 20.21, 6. Math. 6, 24. Psal. 49, 11. Luk. 12, 17, 20. 4 They are disquieted in vaine, hee heapeth vp riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them: (Psal. 39, 6.) And though they heape vp silver as the dust, and pre∣pare rayment as the clay; they may pre∣pare it; but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver: (Iob, 27, 16.) For to the sinner GOD giveth travaile, to gather, and to heape vp, that hee may giue to him that is good before GOD: (Eccles. 2, 26.) And the wealth of the Sinner is layd vp for the Iust: Prou. 13, 22. Psalm. 49, 10. Isa. 23, 18. Genes. 31, 1, 31, 8, 9. Exod. 3, 22.12, 35, 22, 12. Esther, 8, 1, 2. Psal. 105, 43. Ios. 24, 13, 11, 23. Deuter. 6, 11.2, 35, 3, 3, 4.3.12. 1, King. 10, 10. Eccles. 5, 13.2, 22.
Q. What vse is to bee made here∣of? A. 1 Goe to now yee rich men, weepe, and howle for your miseries that shall come vpon you: Iam. 5, 1. 2 Therefore, let not thine heart (who art righteous,) bee envious against sin∣ners; but let it bee in the feare of the LORD continually: (Prou. 23, 17) Neither chuse thou any of his wayes: Prou. 3, 31. CHAP. XLVI. Of favour with Men; a good Name, and Honour. Q. WHich are the eleuenth, and twelfth, and thirteenth tem∣porall blessings? A. The tenth is, the fauour of Men. Hee that loveth purenesse of heart, for the grace of his lips, the King shal be his friend: (Prou. 22, 11.) And when the wayes
of a man please the LORD, hee will ake his enemie to become his friend: Prou. 16, 7. Ier. 15.11. Prou. 28.3. For when ESAV saw IACOB com∣ming towards him, he ran to meete IA∣COB, and embraced him, and fell on his ecke, and kissed him: (Gen. 33.4.0.) GOD gaue the people favour also in the sight of the Aegyptians: (Exod. 3, 21.11.3.12.36.) And extended mercie vnto EZRA, before the King and his Counsellors: (Ezra, 7, 28,) ARTAXEREXS the King, also granted vnto NEHEMIA, according to the good hand of his GOD vpon him: (Neh. 2, 8.) And ESTHER obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked vpon her: Esth. 2, 15. Gen. 26.26.11. verses, 39, 4, 39.21, 33, 4. Ruth. 2, 13.1, 16, 17. 1, Sam. 2, 26 1, 18, 1.3, 1, 18.16, 1, 19, 1, 1, 24.16.1.26, 17 1, 20.17.31.1.27, 6. 1, Chron. 12, 38. Ezra. 6, 22.7, 28, Esth. 8, 17, Ier. 39, 11. Dan. 1, 9. Act. 21.40, 24.23, 27.3. The twelfth, is a good Name: for thou
shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: (Iob. 5 21.) And thy good name shall bee better than a precious oyntment: (Eccl. 7, 1.) And though for thy transgression I doe giue IACOB to the curse, and Israel to reproches: (Isa. 43, 28.) Yet vpon thy repentance I will bring foorth thy Righte∣ousnes as the light, and thy Iudgement as the noone day: (Psal. 37, 6.) When the name of the wicked shall rot: Prou. 10, 7, 12.8. Hosea, 12, 14. But woe be vnto the wicked, when all men shall speake well of them; for so did their Fathers to the false Prophets: Luk. 6, 26. The thirteenth outward blessing is Honour, If any man will serue mee, him will my Father honour: (Iohn. 12, 26.) And it shall come to passe, that if thou shalt hearken diligently vnto the LORD thy GOD, to obserue and doe all his Commandements which I com∣mand thee this day; that the LORD, thy GOD shall set thee on high, aboue all the Nations of the Earth: (Deuteron.
28, 1.) And thou shalt ride on the igh places of the Earth: (Isa, 58.14.) And I will make you a name and a praise, boue all people of the Earth, saith the LORD: (Zeph. 3.20.) The LORD all make thee the head, and not the taile: Deut. 28.13.) And many shall make ite vnto thee: (Iob. 11, 19.) And bow efore thee: Prou. 14, 19. Numb. 24.7. sa. 45, 14. Reu. 3.9. Iob. 36, 7, 11.9.1, Sam. 24, 20. Thus IOSEPH was set over all the Land of Aegypt: (Gen. 41 41,) For the King sent, and loosed him, even the Ruler f the people and let him goe free. He made im Lord of his House, and Ruler of all is Substance: to bind his Princes at his leasure: (Psal. 105.20. Psalm. 78.70, 71.) And King NABVCHADNEZZAR made DANIEL a great man, even a Ru∣ler over the whole Province of Babylon, (Dan. 2, 48) King AHASHVERVS set the Royall Crowne vpon ESTHERS head, and made her Queene instead of VASTI: Esth. 2, 17.
MORDECAY was by HAMAN brought on Horse-backe through the street of the Citie; and he proclaimed before him, thu shall it be done vnto the man whom the King delighteth to honour: (Esth. 6.11.) For MORDECAY being of the seed of the IEWES, HAMAN could not prevaile against him, but did fall before him: Est. 6, 13. Dan. 5, 29. Iosh. 4, 14. 1, Sam. 18.7. 1, Chron. 29, 25.2, 32.33, 2, 15, 9. 1, King. 4.21. Thus GOD raiseth the poore out of the dust, and lifteth the needie out of the dung∣hill, that he may set him with Princes, e∣ven with the Princes of the people: (Psal. 113, 7.) But as for evill men, they bow be∣fore the good, and the wicked at the gates of the Righteous: (Prou. 14, 19.) Their enemies will he cloth with shame; but vpon them shall their Crowne flourish: (Psalm. 132, 18.) The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall bee the promotion of Fooles: Prou. 3, 35, 14, 34. Deut. 28, 43, 28, 68. Isa. 43, 27, 28. Q. What may this teach vs?
A. Therefore get wisedome, and exalt er, and she shall promote thee, shee shall ing thee to honour when thou dost em∣race her; shee shall giue to thine head an nament of Grace; a Crowne of Glorie, hall she deliver to thee: Prou. 4, 7. 2 Pray for the Church, saying; Let the people serue thee, and Nations bowe downe to thee; be LORD over the Brethren, and let thy mothers Sonnes bow downe to thee: Gen. 27, 29. Ob. Notwithstanding there is an e∣vill which I haue seene vnder the Sunne, as an errour which proceedeth from the Ru∣ler. Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. I haue seene Servants vpon Horses, and Princes wal∣king, as Servants vpon the Earth: Eccl. 10, 5. A. As Snow in Summer, and as Raine i Harvest; so is Honour not seemely fo a Foole: (Prou. 26, 1.) For as hee that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is hee that giveth Honour to a Foole: Prouerbs, 26, 8.
2 Though his Excellencie mount vp to the Heavens, and his head reach vnto the Cloudes: yet shall hee perish for ever, like his owne Dung, they which haue seene him shall say where is hee? Hee shall flye away as a dreame, and shall not bee found, yea, hee shall bee cha∣sed away as a Vision in the Night. The eye also which saw him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place a∣ny more bee found. His Children shall seeke to please the poore: (Iob. 20.6.) His Roote shall bee dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his bran∣ches bee cut off, his remembrance shall perish from the Earth, and hee shall haue no name in the Streete: Iob, 18, 16. Isay, 28, 3. Psalme, 49.12. 3 He hath no full content in it. For though HAMAN were advanced; and set aboue all the Princes that were with him, so as all the Kings Servants, that were in the Kings Gate, bowed, and reveren∣ced him; the King commanding the
same, concerning him: (Esth. 3, 1.2.) nd hough hee alone were invited with the King, vnto the Banquet of the Queene, what doth this availe him; so ng as hee seeth MORDECAY, the Iew  in the Gate? Esther, 5, 13. 4 All this haue I also seene, nd applyed my heart vnto, every orke that is done vnder the Sunne: there is a time, wherein one man ruleth over mother to his hurt: Ecclesiastes, 8, 9. Of the Vse of Earthly things. Q. You haue now, something satis∣fied my minde, concerning outward things: what therefore may the pro∣mise of so many Temporall blessings each vs? A. 1. Let your Conversation bee with∣out Covetousnesse; and bee content with such things as you haue: for hee hath said; I will never leaue thee, nor for∣sake thee: (Heb. 13, 5.) But seeke yee first, the Kingdome of GOD, and his Righteousnesse: and all these things, shall be
added vnto you: Math. 6, 33. 2 I know that there is no good in these things; but for a man to reioyce, and to do good in his life. And also that every man should eate, and drinke, and enioy the good of his labour: it is the guift of God: Eccl. 3, 12, 13. 3 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same, one to ano∣ther, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of GOD: 1 Pet. 4, 10. 4 Whether ye eate, or drinke, or what∣soever yee doe; doe all to the Glory of GOD: (1, Cor. 10 31.) Saying; How great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast laid vp for them that feare thee, before the Sonnes of men: (Psal. 31, 19.) Blessed be the Lord, who daily ladeth vs with his blessings: even the God of our Salvation: Psal. 68, 19. 5 What man is he, that desireth Life, and loveth many dayes; that hee may see good? Keepe thy tongue from evill, and thy lips from speaking guile: depart from evill, and doe good: Psal. 34, 12.
CHAP. XLVII. Promises concerning Posterity. Oh. HAd I all these Temporall blessings in possession, thus promised, yet O LORD GOD, what wilt thou giue me, seeing I goe child∣lesse? Gen. 15, 2. A. O that thou hadst hearkened to my Commandements, then had thy seed beene s the Sand, and the off-spring of thy bow∣els, like the grauell thereof: thy name should not haue beene out off, nor destroyed from before me: Isa. 48, 18.18. Q. But what if I doe repent, and a∣mend? A. Then be thou fruitfull, and multi∣ply: (Gen. 9, 1.) Let thy wife be as a fruit∣full vine, by the sides of thine house; thy Children like Oliue plants round about thy table. Behold, thus shall the man bee bles∣sed that feareth the LORD: (Psal. 128, 3.) Loe children are an heritage of the Lord,
and the fruit of the wombe is his reward: Psal. 127, 3. For the Lord opened LEAHS wombe: (Gen. 29, 31.) HANNAH also whose wombe before time, the LORD had shut vp, yet did shee bare a Sonne, and called his name SAMVEL: 1, Sam. 1, 20, 25, 21, Ruth. 4, 13. Iudg. 13.2, 24. Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thy off-spring as the grasse of the Earth: Iob, 5, 25. Psal. 113.9. Gen. 4.1.4. 25.33.5. Ob. After I am waxed old, shall I haue pleasure; my Lord beeing old also? (Gen. 18, 12.) Nay my Lord, thou man of GOD, doe not lye vnto thine handmaid, 2, King. 4, 16. A. Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed, saith GOD, I will returne vnto thee, according to the time of life, and thou shalt haue a Sonne: (Gen. 18, 14.) And the Lord did vnto SARAH as he had spoken: (Gen. 21.1.) For through faith shee received strength to conceiue seed, and was delivered of a child, when shee
was past age; because she iudged him faith∣full who had promised. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the Starres of the skye in multi∣tude, and as the sand which is by the Sea shore innumerable: Heb. 11.11. 2, King. 4. 14. Luk. 1, 7, 13.1, 57.60. Ob. I haue seene many of GODS Children, both liue, and dye Child∣lesse? A. Let not therefore the Eunuch say; Be∣hold, I am a dry tree. For thus saith the LORD to the Eunuches, that keepe my Sabbaths, and choose the thing that plea∣seth mee, and taketh hold of my Cove∣nant; even to them will I giue in mine House, and within my Walles a place, nd a name better than of Sonnes, and of Daughters; I will giue them an everla∣ting Name, that shall not be cut off: Isa. 56, 3. Ob, But this feare yet remaines, that when my Child commeth to the birth, my wife shall haue no strength to bee delivered.
A. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring foorth, saith the LORD? Shall I cause to bring foorth, and shut the wombe saith thy GOD? (Isa. 66.9.) For SARAH said, GOD hath made me laugh, so that all that heare, will laugh with mee: (Gen. 21.6.) Therefore feare not ZACHA∣RIAS, for thy wife ELIZABETH shall beare thee a Sonne, and thou shalt haue ioy, and gladnesse, and many shall reioyce at his birth: Luk. 1.13, 14. Q. If the hauing of Children bee of the blessing of GOD to the Righteous, what shall the wicked haue? A. Giue them O LORD, what thou wilt giue? Giue them a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts: (Hos. 9, 14) And write yee this man childlesse: (Ier. 22, 30.) For hee shall neither haue Sonne nor Ne∣phew among his people, nor any remainder among his dwellings. They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God: Iob. 18, 19. 2, Sam. 6, 23.
Ob. But who more then the wicked, doe abound with Children? A. If their Children bee multiplyed it is for the sword. (Iob. 27, 14.) Also I will send wild beasts among them, which shall robbe them of their Children: (Leuit. 26, 22.) For the face of the LORD is against them that doe evill, to cut off the remembrance of them from the Earth: Psal. 34, 16, 37, 28.1, King. 14, 10, 1, 15, 29.1, 16.3, 41.16. 11, 12.1, 21.21.25 2.9.8.2.10.7.11. Hos. 14. 1. Ezek. 24.21.25. 2, Sam. 12, 9.2, 12.18. Q. When I haue Children, what is the comfort I shall receiue by them? Eccl. 2, 18, 19. A. The Father of the Righteous shall greatly reioyce, and he that begetteth a wise Sonne shall haue ioy in him. His Father, and Mother shall be glad, and she that bare him shall reioyce: (Prou. 23, 24) For as arrowes are in the hand of the mighty man, so are Children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his Quiver full of them; they shall not bee ashamed, but they shall speake with the enemies in the gate: Psal. 127.4.
For NOAHS two Sonnes covered their Fathers nakednesse: (Gen. 9, 23.) And IOSEPH nourished his old Father, and Brethren in the time of dearth: (Gen. 45, 9, 50, 1.) And NAOMIE her Sonne, was a restorer of her life, and a nou∣risher of her old age: Ruth, 4, 15. 2, Chron. 2, 12. Gen 28, 7, 45, 23. But SENAGHERIB as he was worship∣ping in the House of NISROCH his GOD, that ADRAMELECH, and SHAREZER his Sonnes, smote him with the Sword that he dyed: 2, King. 19, 37. Ob. When God by death taketh me away, what the miseries are, which shall then befall my Children, I know not. A. A good man walking in his integri∣tie, his Children are blessed after him: (Prou. 20, 7.) For he leaveth his inheri∣tance to his Childrens children; and the wealth of the sinner is laid vp for the iust: (Prou. 13, 22.) His seed shall be mighty on the Earth; the generation of the vpright shall be blessed: (Psal. 112, 1.) They shall spring vp among the Grasse, as willowes by
the water courses: (Isa. 44 4.) Their seed also shall be knowne among the Gentiles, and their off-spring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed, which the Lord hath bles∣sed: Isa. 61, 9. Know therefore, that the LORD thy GOD, he is God, the faithfull God, which keepeth Covenant, and mercie, with them that loue him, and keepe his Commande∣ments, to a thousand Generations: Deut. 7, 9. Isa. 65, 23. Psal. 102, 28.103.17. 1, Sam. 25, 28.1, King. 9, 4. Exod. 20, 6. Heb. 11.20. Gen. 25, 11. Prou. 11, 21. Psal. 146.9. But it shall come to passe, that every one that is left in the house of the wicked; shall come, and crouch to the Righteous for a piece of silver and a morsell of bread, and shall say; put me I pray thee into one of the Priests offices, that I may eate a piece of bread: (1, Sam. 2, 36.) For his riches perish by evill travell, and he begetteth a Son, and there is nothing in his hand: (Eccl. 5, 14.) Neither shall his off-spring bee satisfied with bread: Iob. 27, 14.
Ob. What assurance can you giue me, that my Children will not prooue wicked, whereby to be liable to the curse, as well as other Children, whose Parents are out of the Covenant? A. If the first fruits be holy, the lumpe is also holy; and if the Roote bee holy, so are the brvnches. (Rom. 11.16.) And as for mee, this is my Covenant with you; my spirit that is vpon thee, and my word which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seeds seed: saith the LORD, from henceforth, and for e∣ver: (Isa. 59, 21.) For the LORD made not this Covenant with our Fathers; but with vs, even vs, who are all of vs a∣liue this day: (Deut. 5, 3.) For God be∣ing the God, not of the faithfull onely, but also of their seed: (Gen. 17, 7.) Thou shalt be saved, and thy House: Acts, 16, 31. Gen. 17, 21.4.4. Ob. One of the Parents themselues may be out of the Covenant; how then
can this Couenant belong vnto their po∣steritie? A. The vnbeleeving Husband is san∣ctified by the Wife, and the vnbeleeving wife, is sanctified by the husband; else were your Children vncleane, but now are they holy: 1, Cor. 7, 14. Ob. It were much more to my com∣fort, if wee were both of vs within the Couenant? A. If any man obey not the Word, they may without the Word bee wonne, by the conversation of the wiues: (1, Pet. 3, 1.) For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O Man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife? 1. Cor. 7, 16. Ob. But doth not the Sonne beare the iniquitie of his Father? Else whence this Proverbe? The Fathers haue eaten sowre grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge: Ezek. 18, 2. A. The Fathers shall not be put to death for the Children, neyther shall the chil∣dren bee put to death for their fathers;
every man shall bee put to death for his owne sinne: (Deut. 24, 16.) And e∣very man shall beare his owne burthen: Gal. 6, 5. What meane they then to vse this Pro∣verbe, saying: The Fathers haue eaten sower grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge? (Ezek. 18, 2.) For every one shall dye in his owne iniquitie, every man that eateth the sower grape, his teeth shall be set on edge: Ier. 31.29, 30. Ezek. 18, 18. Num. 14, 29. Deut. 1.39. 1, King. 14, 13, 15, 3. Q. What may the Children of wic∣ked parents learne hence? A. Not to walke in the statutes of their Fathers, nor to obserue their iudgements, nor to defile themselues with their Idols: (Ezek. 20.18.) to bee as their Fathers, a stubborne and rebellious generation, &c. (Psal. 78, 8.) hardening their hearts as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the Wildernesse, &c. (Psal. 95, 8.) Vnto whom the former Prophets haue cryed, saying; Thus saith the
LORD of hostes, Turne yee now from our evil wayes, and from your evill do∣ngs; but they did not heare nor hear. n vnto mee, saith the LORD: Zach. 1.4. Q. But what if the Children of god∣ly parents proue wicked? Shall the god∣linesse of the parents shelter them from the judgements of the wicked? A. As I liue, saith the LORD, though Conaiah, the sonne of Iehoiakim, King of Iudah, were the Signet vpon my right hand, yet would I plucke him thence: Ier, 22, 24. I said indeed vnto ELY; That thy house, and the house of thy Fathers, shall walke before me for ever: but now bee it farre from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me, shall bee lightly esteemed: (1. Sam. 2. 30.) Wherefore cursed be CANAAN, a servant, of servants shall hee bee vnto his Brethren: (Gen. 9.25.) and even as EPHRAIM beeing wicked, shall bring forth his children to the Mur∣therer:
Hos. 9, 13, 9, 12. 1, Sam. 4, 11. 1, King. 2, 27. 1, 11.11, 11.14, 11.23, 11, 31. Q. What if parents, and children, doe both of them proue wicked? Psalm. 106, 6. A. GOD will then visit the iniqui∣ties of the Fathers vpon their Children, vnto the third, and fourth Generation, of them that hate him: (Exod. 20, 5.) Whereby their iniquities, and the iniqui∣ties of their Fathers shall bee together, &c. And hee will measure their worke, into their owne bosome: Isa. 65, 7. Q. What meanes are then to bee v∣sed, whereby these evils beeing preven∣ted, I may haue comfort in my Chil∣dren? A. 1 Your power beeing to lead about a wife being a sister: (1, Cor. 9, 5.) Mar∣rie to whom you will; onely in the LORD: (1, Cor. 7.39.) Thou shalt not take a Wife that is a whore, or prophane, neither shall you take a woman, put away from her Husband: (Leuit. 21, 7.) None of you shall
approach to any that is neere of affini∣ie to him, to vncover their naked∣esse: (Leuit. 18, 6.) Nor yet as the Sonnes of GOD in the old World, who when they saw the Daughters of men that they were faire, tooke them wiues, of all which they chose: (Gen. 6, 1.) But as ABRAHAM who would not take a wife vnto his Sonne of the Daughters of Canaan, among whom hee dwelt, but of his owne Countrey, and Kin∣dred: Gen. 24, 3, 6, 3. 2 Take heed to your Spirit, and let none deale treacherously with the wife of his youth; for did hee not make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That hee might seeke a godly seed: (Malac. 2, 15.) There∣fore make a Covenant with thine eyes; for why shouldest thou thinke vpon a Mayd? Iob, 31, 1, 9, 10. verses. Math. 19, 4. Mal. 2, 13, 14. Leu. 18, 20.20, 10. 2, Sam. 12, 11. Hos. 4, 10. 3 Doe as NAOMI did, who tooke her Child, and layd it in her bosome,
and became a Nurse vnto it: (Ruth, 4, 16.) Which that HANNAH might also doe, shee went not vp to offer vnto the LORD her yeerely offering, vntill her child was weyned: 1, Sam. 1, 22. Exod. 2, 8. Lam. 4, 3. 4 Suffer your little Children to come vnto CHRIST, to bee Baptized, and forbid them not: (Math. 19, 14.) And then lend them vnto the LORD, as long as they liue: 1, Sam. 1, 28. 5 Obserue, and heare all the words which I command thee, so shall it bee well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever; when thou doest that which is good, and right in the sight of the LORD thy GOD: (Deut. 12, 28.) For the Iust walking in his integritie, his Chil∣dren are blessed after him: (Prou. 20, 7.) Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked shall not bee vnpunished; but the seed of the Righteous shall be delivered: Prou. 11, 21. Num. 25, 12. 2, Tim. 1, 5. 2, King. 10, 30. Prou. 13, 22.14, 26. 6 Doe as IACOB, who by Faith,
when hee was a dying, blessed both the nes of IOSEPH, and worshipped, lea∣ing vpon the top of his Staffe, (Heb. 11, 1.) and saying; The Angell, which re∣emed mee from all evill, blesse the lads, nd let my name, be named on them, and he name of my Fathers ABRAHAM, and SAAC, and let them grow into a multi∣de, in the middest of the Earth: (Gen. 8, 16.) And as plants growne vp in their outh; let my Daughters bee as corners ones, polished after the similitude of a Palace: Psal. 144, 12. Ruth, 4, 11, 12. , Sam. 6 20.2, 7, 27. Deut. 33, 24. 7 Because, if you trayne vp your chil∣dren in the way they are to goe, they will ut depart from it when they are old: (Prou. 22, 6.) Therefore you Fathers provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them vp in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord: (Ephes. 6, 4.) And let the words which I command you this day be in thy heart, and doe yee teach them diligently vnto your Children: (Deut. 6, 6, 20.) And let your Children
tell their Children; and their Children a∣nother Generation: Ioel. 1, 3. Psal. 78, 1.44.1. Iosh. 4.5, 4, 21. Exod. 12, 26.13.8, 14, 5. Numb. 31.54. Isa. 38, 19. Deut. 32, 46. 2, Tim. 1, 5, 6.2, 3, 15. Q. This admonition I shall the better giue, if you will giue me some directi∣on therein. A. Say thus vnto thy Child; my Sonne heare the instruction of thy Father, and forsake not the Law of thy Mother; for they shall bee an ornament of Grace vnto thy head, and chaines about thy necke: (Prou. 1, 8.) Bind them continu∣ally vpon thine heart, and tye them a∣bout thy necke; when thou goest it shall leade thee, and when thou sleepest it shall keepe thee; and when thou awakest it shall talke with thee: (Prou. 6, 21.) For I was my Fathers Sonne, tender, and onely beloved in the sight of my Mother, Hee taught me also, and said vnto mee, let thy heart retaine my words, keepe my Commandements, and liue. Get wise∣dome, get vnderstanding, forget is not,
neither decline from the words of my outh. Forsake her not, and she shall pre∣serue thee; loue her, and shee shall keepe thee. Wisedome is the principall thing; herefore get wisedome, and with all thy etting get vnderstanding: exalt her, and he shall promote thee, shee shall bring thee o Honour, when thou doest embrace her. Shee shall giue to thine head n Ornament of Grace, a Crowne of Glory shall shee deliver to thee: Prou. 4, 3, 1, 10. Exod. 13, 14. Deut. 6, 20.1, King. 2, 2. Thus if thou shalt doe, all thy Chil∣dren shall bee also taught of GOD, and great shall bee the prosperity of thy Chil∣ren: Isa. 54, 13. Ob. I haue thus farre proceeded al∣ready in the instruction of my Sonne, yet is he neuer the better. A. Then say vnto him; what my Sonne! And what the Sonne of my wombe! And what the Sonne of my vowes! (Prou. 31.1.) Why doest thou such things? For I heare of your evill dealings,
by all this people, Nay my Sonnes, for it is no good report I heare; yee make the LORDS people to transgresse. If one man sinne against another, the Iudge, shall iudge him: but if a man sinne against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? (1. Sam. 2, 23.) Thus if thou correct thy Sonne, hee shall giue thee rest; yea, hee shall giue delight to thy Soule: Prou. 29, 17.15, 31. 1, King. 2, 1.2, 11. Ob. But my Sonne will not bee cha∣stised with words; for say I to him what I can, hee will doe what himselfe listeth. A. Folly is bound in the heart of a Child; but the rod of Correction will driue it farre from him: (Prou. 22, 15,) The blewnesse of the wound, cleanseth away e∣vill; so doe stripes the inward parts of the belly: Pro. 2, 30. Threre with-hold not correction from the Child, for if thou beatest him with te od hee shall not dye. Thou shalt beae him with the Rod, and shalt
deliver his Soule from Hell: (P. 2, 14.) For the Rod, and reproofe giue Wisedome, but a Childe left to him∣selfe, bringeth his Mother to shame: Prou. 29, 15. 2, Chron. 22, 3. 1, King. 1, 5, 6. Prou. 13, 24 19, 18. Q. What if vpon my Sonnes com∣miting of some grosse sinne, I should negect to chastse him? A. It shall bee vnto thee, as it was with ELI, vnto whom it was said; Be∣cause thy Sonne hath made himselfe vile, nd ho hast not restrained him, there∣fore (sath GOD) I haue sworne to the house of ELI, that the iniquitie of E∣LIES House shall not be purged with Sa∣crifice, nor offering for ever: (1, Sam. 3.14.) And so it came to passe, that his Sonnes were slaine: (1, Sam. 4, 11) And ELI himselfe fell from off his Seate backward, by the side of the Gate, and his necke brake, and hee dyed: &c. And his Daughter in Law PHINEHAS Wife was with child, neere to bee delivered; who when she heard these tidings, she bowed
her selfe, and travailed, and so dyed: 1, Sam. 5.18. Ob. My feare is, that when my Son is past the rod, he doe as ESAV, who by his marriage of the Daughter of the Hittits, was a griefe of mind vnto ISAAC, and REBECHA: (Gen. 26.34.) So my Sonne by the like marriage, bee a griefe vnto me. A. For preuention, Say vnto him; Is there never a woman among the Daugh∣ters of the Brethren, or among all my peo∣ple, that thou goest to take a wife of the vncircumcised Philistins? (Iudg. 14, 3.) Thou shalt not make marriages with them: (Deut. 7, 3.) Nor take a wife of them: Gen. 28.1, 34.14. Ez. 9, 12. Nehem. 13.25. 1, King. 16, 31. For did not SALOMON, King of Is∣rael sinne by these things? Yet among ma∣ny Nations, was there no King like vnto him, who was beloved of his God: and God made him King over all Israel; ne∣verthelesse, even him did Out landish women cause to sinne: (Neh. 13.26.) And
did not Israel, when they tooke the Daugh∣ters of the Cananites to be their wiues and gaue their Daughters to their Sonnes, serue their GODS? (Iudg. 3.6.) Did not Ahazia also walke in the way of the house of Ahab, in doing evill in the sight of the LORD a did the House of Ahab? (2. King. 8, 27.) And will you a∣gaine breake God, Commandements, and ioyne in affinity with such? (Ezra. 9, 14.) Will you deale thu treacherously, and commit this abhomination in Israel; in prophaning the holines of the Lord, which he loved, and marry the Daughter of a strange God? The Lord will cut off the man that doth this; the Master, and the Scholler, out of the Tabernacles of IACOB, and him that offereth an offe∣ring to the Lord of Hosts: Mal. 2, 11. Iosh. 23 12. Numb. 33.55, Q. The labour of Parents in educa∣ting their Children, seemes to be great; what recompence therefore in liew thereof shall Children returne vnto their Parents?
A. They shll feare every man his mo∣ther and his Father: (Leu. 19.3.) And shall obey their Parents, for that is right. They shall honour their Father, and Mo∣ther which is the first Commandement with promise: Eph. 6, 1. Pou. 23, 22. 1, King. 2, 19. Ier. 35, 6. Numb. 30.3. Ob. There is a Generation that curseth their Father and doth not blesse their Mo∣ther: Prou, 30, 11. A. The eye that mocketh at his Father, and despiseth to obey his Mother, the Ra∣vens of the valley shall picke it out, and the young Eagles shall eate it: (Pu. 30 17.) And every one that curseth his Father, or his Mother shall bee surely put to death: he that hath cursed his Father, or hs Mo∣ther, his bloud shall bee vpon him: (Leuit. 20, 9) And his lampe shall be put out in ob∣scure darkenesse: (Prou. 20 20.) Y cur∣sed be he that setteth light by his Father, or his mother, and all the people shall say, A∣men; Deut. 27, 16.28, 24.
CHAP. XLVIII. The Vse of all the Promises. Ob. WHat may these blessings on our selues, and our po∣sterity teach vs? A. Goe therefore, and sit before the Lord, and say, Who am I O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy Servants house for a great while to come; and is this the manner of man, O Lord God? And what can I say more vnto thee? &c. And now O Lord God, thou art that God who hast promi∣sed this goodnesse vnto thy Servant; there∣fore now let it please thee, to blesse the house of thy Servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou O Lord God, hast spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy Servant be blessed for ever: 2, Sam. 7, 19, 28, 29. verse.
2 Because it shall be said of IACOB, and of Israel, what hath GOD done? (Nmb. 23, 23.) Returne vnto thine owne house and shew how great things the LORD hath done for thee: (Luk. 8, 39.) And reioyce before the Lord your God, yee and your Sonnes and your Daughters, and your Men Servants, and your Maid-Servants, Deut. 12, 12, 16, 11.15. Isay. 12.4. Saying; It is a good thing to giue thanks vnto God, and to sing praise vnto thy name, O thou most high; to shew forth thy loving kindnesse in the morning, and thy faithfulnesse every night: (Psal. 92, 1.) For many O Lord my God are thy wonderfull workes which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to vs ward they cannot be reckoned vp in order vnto thee; if I would declare and speake of them, they are moe than can be numbred: (Psal. 40, 5.) Thy mercy, also O Lord, is in the Heavens, and thy faithfulnesse reacheth vnto the Clouds. Thy righteousnes is like the great Moun∣taines, thy iudgements are a great Deepe: (Psal. 36, 5.)
How precious are thy thoughts vnto mee O GOD; how great is the summe of them? f I should count them, they are moe in num∣ber than the sand: Psalm. 139.17.31.19.2.4.5. Blessing, and glory, and wisdome, and thankesgiuing, and honour, and power, and night, bee vnto our GOD: (Ru. 7.12.) For ever, and ever: (1. Tim. 1.17.) and from everlasting, to everlasting; and let ll the people say, Amen: Psalm. 106.48.63.3.4.69.30.31. Isa. 63.7.25.1. Psalm. 104.33.34.1.35.28.116.13.40.9.45.17. Exod. 15.11. Psalm. 57.7.147.1.33.1.34.3.97.1.68.4.30.4.47.6.7. Psalm. 72.18.135.1.19.136.1.103.20.150.6.72.19.
CHAP. XLIX. The properties of GODS Promises. Q. GReat cause indeed haue we thus to giue thanks; for here are ma∣ny Promises, and for all purposes, both great, and precious, if they be as true, as good. A. These things saith the Amen, the faithfull, and true witnesse, (Reu. 3.14) are the true sayings of GOD, (Reuel. 19.9.) I IESVS haue sent mine Angell to testifie these things in the Churches. (Reu. 22.16.) Therefore write, these words are true, and faithfull. (Reu. 21.5.22, 6.) For GOD will performe his truth to IACOB, and his mercie to ABRAHAM, which hee hath sworne to our Fathers, from the dayes of old: (Mih. 7.0.) Hee confir∣meth the word of his Sernt, and he per∣formeth the counsell of his Messengers: (Isa. 44, 26.) Hee said not vnto the
seed of IACOB; Seeke yee my face in vaine, I the LORD speake righteous∣nesse, I declare the things that are right: (Is. 45 19.) For it is GOD that can∣not lye who hath thus promised, be∣fore the World began: (Titus, 1, 2.) Whe efore let GOD be true, and every man a lyar, as it is written; that thou mightest be Iustified in thy sayings, and ouercome when thou art Iudged: Rom. 3.4. 2, Cor. 1.18. Pal. 58.11.33.5.12, 6.30, 5. Num. 23, 19. Q. What good witnesses can you produce, that may conuince vs of the truth of these things? A. Though (saith CHRIST,) I beare record of my selfe, yet my re∣cord is true. I am one that beare wit∣nesse of my selfe, and the Father that hath sent mee beareth witnesse of mee: (Io. 8, 14, 18.) who is true; and I speake to the world, the things which I haue heard from him: (Ioh. 8, 26.) The Disciple also whom IESVS loued te∣stfied these things, and wee know
that his testimony is true: (Ioh. 21.24.) IOHN indeed did no miracle, but all things that IOHN spake of this man were true: (Ioh. 10, 41.) And every one that hath received his testimony hath set to his seale that GOD is true: Ioh. 3, 33. 1. Ioh. 1, 5. Q. Who haue at any time vpon their owne experience proued them so to be? A. Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts, and in all your soules, that not one thing hath failed, of all the good things which the Lord your GOD spake concerning you; all things are come to passe vnto you, not one thing hath failed thereof: (Ios. 23, 14.21.45.) For it came to passe, at the end of foure hundred and thirty yeares, as was promised: (Gen. 15, 14.) even the selfe-same day, it came to passe, that all the hostes of the LORD went out from the land of Aegypt: (Exod. 12, 41.) vnto whom the LORD gaue all the Land which hee sware to giue to theyr Fathers, and they possessed it,
and they dwelt therein. And the ORD gaue them rest round about, ac∣rding to all that hee sware vnto their athers, and there stood not a man of all heir enemies before them. There failed ot ought of any good thing, which the LORD hath spoken vnto the house of ISRAHL; all came to passe: (Iosh. 21, 43.) So that he hath dealt well with his servants, according to his Word: (Psal. 119.63.) And all his counsels of old are faithfulnesse, and truth: Isa. 25, 1. 1 King. 8, 20. 2 Chron. 6, 15. Q. What then, may this truth of GOD in promising teach vs? A. 1 To beleeue: for if wee receiue the witnesse of men: the witnesse of GOD is greater. For this is the witnesse of GOD, which hee hath testified of his Sonne: (1, Ioh. 5, 9.) Wherefore sirs, bee of good cheere; for I beleeue GOD; thus it shall bee, even as it was told mee: (Act. 27 25.) For shall mortall man be more iust than GOD? And shall a man bee more pure than his Maker? Iob,
4, 17. Rom. 3, 3, 4. Luk. 11.13. 2 To say, Lord GOD of Israel, there is no GOD like thee in Heaven aboue, or on Earth beneath, who keepeth Cove∣nant, and mercy with thy servants, that walke before thee, with all their hearts: (1, King. 8, 23.) Wherefore blessed bee the LORD, which spake with his mouth vnto DAVID my Father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it: 1. King. 8.15.20. 3 To Pray, saying; Remember the word vnto thy seruant, vpon which thou hast caused me to trust: Psal. 119.49. 4 Thou also shalt keepe my couenant therefore; thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations: (Gen. 17, 9.) As well as the Iewes, who did according to their promise. Else, as the Prophet shooke his lappe, and said: so GOD shall shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not his promise; even thus be he shaken out and emptied, vnto which say, Amen: Nehem. 5, 13. 5 For which and also say; Lead me
in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art e GOD of my saluation: Psal. 25, 5. Ob. I doe now acknowledge GOD to ee true of his Word; but was he not ooued to make these promises for ame thing of speciall worth he see to e in vs deseruing the same? A. Were yee not as the Ethiopians vnto e, O children of Israel, saith the LORD? (Amos, 9.7.) For even TERAH the Father of ABRAHAM, and the Father f NACHOR, they serued other Gods: (Iosh. 24.2.) So hath the LORD also called thee, being a Woman forsaken, and afflicted in spirit, and as a young wife when thou wast refused, saith thy GOD. (Isa. 54 6) And when he passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy owne blood, he said vnto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, liue. Yea, he said vnto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live: Ezek. 16.6. Isa. 51.1.2. Hos. 14.4. Ob. Though hee did finde vs wic∣ked, yet doth he not leaue vs so; and therefore for some fore-seene good,
that would bee in vs, hee might be mo∣ued hereunto. A. Can a man be profitable vnto God, as hee that is wise may be profitable vnto himselfe? Is it any pleasure to the Al∣mighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gaine to him that thou makest thy wayes perfect? (Iob. 22, 2.) Looke vnto the Heavens, and see, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou sin∣nest, what doest thou against him? Or if thy transgressions bee multiplyed, what doest thou vnto him? If thou bee righte∣ous, what givest thou him? Or what re∣ceiveth hee of thine hand? Iob, 35, 5. Psal. 16, 2. Which of you having a Servant Plow∣ing or feeding Cattell; will say vnto him by, and by; when he is come from the field; Goe and sit downe to meate? And will not rather say vnto him, make ready, where∣with I may sup, and gird thy selfe, and serue mee, till I haue eaten, and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eate, and drinke. Doth hee thanke that servant, because hee
did these things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewise yee, when yee shall haue done all these things, which are commanded you, say; Wee are vnpro∣fitable servants; wee haue done but that which is our duty to doe: Luk. 17 7. Q. What was it then, which moued the LORD thus liberally to deale with vs? A. Because the Lord loved you, and because hee would keepe the Oath which he sware vnto your fathers: (Deut. 7, 8, 9, 6.) Herein is loue, not that wee loved GOD, but that hee loved vs: (1, Ioh. 4, 10.) And wee loue him because he loved vs first: (1 Ioh. 4 19.) For was not E∣SAV IACOBS brother, saith the LORD? Yet I haue loved IACOB: (Ml 1, 2.) For the Children being not yet borne neither having done good, or evill: that the purpose of GOD, according to the Electi∣on might stand; not of Workes, but of him that calleth▪ it was said vnto her, The el∣der shall serue the younger, as it is writ∣ten: Rom. 9.11.
So then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that shew∣eth mercy: (Rom. 9 15.) And so Mer∣cy and Truth are met together: Psal. 85, 10. Exod. 33, 19. Ier. 31, 3. Rom. 11, 32. Iam. 5, 15. Ps. 25.11. Ob. But why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? Rom. 9.19. A. Nay, but O man who art thou that replyest against God? Shall the thing for∣med say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay; of the same lumpe, to make one vessell vnto honour, and ano∣ther to dishonour? (Rom. 9, 20.) Woe vnto him that hu striveth with his Maker; let the Potsherd striue with the Potsherds of the earth, &c. Woe be vnto him that saith to his Father, what begettest thou? Or to the woman, what hast thou brought forth? (Isa. 45, 9) And is it not then lawfull for mee to doe as I will with mine owne? Math. 20, 15. Ob. he branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in? Rom. 11, 19.
A. Well; because of vnbeliefe, they were broken off and thou standest by faith; be not high minded, but feare. For if God spared not the naturall branches, take heed least hee also spare not thee. Behold there∣fore the goodnesse, and severity of GOD; on them that fell severity but towards thee goodnesse, if thou continue in his goodnesse: otherwise, thou also shalt be cut off. And they also if they abide not still in vnbeliefe, shall be graffed in; for God is able to graffe them in againe: (Rom. 11.20.) Boast not therefore against the branches; but if thou boast thou bearest not the root, but the roote thee: Rom. 11, 18. Q. Why? what is the reason of this free, and vndeserved mercy of GOD? A. 1 That no flesh should glory in his presence but according as it is written; let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord: 1, Cor. 1, 9, 1. 2 That yee might learne not to thinke of men, aboe that which is written; that none of you be puffed vp, for one against an∣other: 1, Cor. 4, 6.
Q. What may this free mercy of God teach vs? A. To say, O the depth of the Riches, both of the wisedome, and knowledge of GOD! How vnsearchable are his iudg∣ments, and his wayes past finding out? For who hath knowne the mind of the LORD? Or who hath beene his Coun∣seller? Or who hath first gven to him, and it shall bee recompenced vnto him a∣gaine? Rom 11, 33. 2 To say, not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy Name bee given the glory: (Psalm. 115, 1.) Fr as for mee, I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer∣cies, and of all the truth which, hee hath shewed vnto his Servant: (Gen. 32, 10.) For off him, and through him, and for him are all things; to him therefore be glory for ever, and ever, Amen. Rom. 11, 36 1. Cor. 4, 7. 3 I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living Sacrifice Holy and acceptable vnto God, which is your reasonable Service, (Rom. 12,
1.) And sow to your selues in Righteousnes, and reape in mercy: H . 10, 12. 4 Pray, saying; Remember me O my GOD concerning my good deeds, and spare me according to the greatnesse of thy mer∣cy. (Neh. 13, 14, 22.) Crying, Grace, Grace vnto it: Zach. 4 7. Q. Are these blessings common vnto all degrees of men? A. Will hee regard your persons, saith the LORD of Hosts: (Mal. 1, 9.) Hee will blesse them that feare the LORD both small and great: (Psal. 115, 13.) Neither is there respect of persons with him: (Eph. 6, 9.) For he that is called in the LORD, being a Servant, is the LORDS free man: 1, Cor. 7, 22. 1, Tim. 2, 4. Q. Are not these bssings peculiar vnto the nation of the Iewes? A. In thy seed (saith GOD to ABRA∣HAM) shall all the Nations of the earth bee blessed: (Gen. 26, 4.) Is he the GOD of the Iewes onely, and not of the Gentiles also? (Reu. 3, 29.) There is no difference, betwixt the Iew, and the Greeke; for
the same Lord over all is rich vnto all that call vpon him Rm. 10, 12. Iohn, 11, 51. Zch. 6, 15, 8, 23. Isay, 60.4.5, 9.10. verses, 60, 22.11, 10.42, 6, 45, 23 49, 6. Gen. 12, 3. Acts, 10, 15.28.28.28.11.20.15.11.14 21.14 27. Mat. 12, 21. Ioh. 10.16.12, 32. Ob. But doth not PAVL say, that vnto the Israelites pertaineth the pro∣mises? A. True, and therefore it was neces∣sarie, that the word of God should first bee spoken vnto them; but they put it from them, and thereby judi themselues vnworthy thereof, wee turned to the Gen∣tiles. For so hath the Lord commanded vs, saying. I haue made thee a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be fo Salvati∣on vnto the ends of the earth: Act 3, 46. And God which knoweth the hearts, beare witnesse to the Gentiles, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as hee did vnto the Iewes; putting no difference, betweene vs and them, after that by faith hee had purified their hearts: (Acts, 15.8.) That
the Gentiles should be fellow Heires, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in CHRIST by the Gospell: (Eph. 3, 6.) There is therefore neither Iew nor Greeke, there is neither bond, nor free; there is nei∣ther male, nor female; for yee are all one in CHRIST IESVS: Gal. 3, 28. 1, Tim. 2.15.1.2.7. Rom. 15.15. Math. 22.2.23.37. Acts. 14.2. Ioh. 1, 11. Isa, 65, 2. Rom. 10.21. Ob. What aduantage then hath the Iew? Or what profit is there of Circum∣cision? A. Much every way; chiefly because that vnto them, were committed the Oracles of God: Rom. 3, 2. Ob. We see, not onely the Nation of the Iewes, but many others of the Gen∣tiles also to be without the benefit of the Gospell. A. This is because of their vnbe∣liefe: (Rom. 11.20.) For they will not receiue CHRIST: (Ioh. 1.11.) But are disobedient, and a gain-saying people: (Rom. 10.21.) For as I liue saith the Lord God, I haue no pleasure in the death of the
wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue: (Ezk. 33, 11.) And I would haue all men to bee saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth: 1, Tim. 2, 4. Ioh. 1, 5. Q. Whereunto may the generality of the promises be of vse? A. Let not the Sonne of the stranger that hath ioyned himselfe to the LORD, speake, saying, The Lord hath vtterly sepa∣rated me from his people; neither let the Eu∣nuch say, behold I am a drie tree. For thus saith the LORD, to the Euches that kepe my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please mee, and take hold of my Cove∣nant; even vnto them will I giue in mine House and within my Walles a place, and a Name better than of Sons, and of Daugh∣ters, I will g ue them an everlasting Name, that shall not bee cut off (Isa. 62 2.) Sing O barren, thou that didst not beare; breake forth into singing, and crie aloud: thou that didst not travaile wth Child, for moe are the Children of the Desolate, than the Children of
the married wife saith the LORD. En∣large the place of thy Tent, and let them stretch foorth the Curtaines of thine habi∣tations: spare not, lengthen thy Cords, and strengthen thy Stakes for thou shalt breake foorth on the right hand, and on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate Cities to bee inha∣bited: Isay, 54, 1. 1, Corinth. 7, 21, 22. Ia. 45 22. Math. 22, 2. Tit. 2, 11. Heb. 1.13. Ob. Now of a truth I perceiue, that GOD is no accepter of persons, but in eve∣ry Nation, he that feareth him, and wor∣keth Righteousnesse, shall be accepted with with him: (Acts, 10, 34.) But will it not be very long betwixt the promise, and the time of theyr accomplishment? A. Hee which testifieth these things, saith, surely I come quickly: (Revel. 22.20.) And my reward is with me, to giue every man acording as his worke shall bee: Reu. 22, 12. Ob. Long haue I waited, and yet haue not obtained?
A. Beloved be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the LORD as a thousand yeeres, and a thousand yeeres as one day. The LORD is not slack con∣cerning his promise (as some men count slacknesse:) (2. Pet. 3.8.) And he that be∣leeueth shall not make hast: (Isa. 28.16.) For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speake and not lye; though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tary: (Hab. 2.3.) For so ABRAHAM after hee had patiently endured, he obtayned the promise (Heb. 6.15.) Amen, even so come LORD IESVS. (Reu. 22.20. Q. But may not GOD alter his mind? A. The Counsell of the LORD stan∣deth for ever; the thoughts of his heart, vnto all generations: (Psal. 33.11) With him is no variablenesse, nor shadow by tur∣ning: (Iames, 1.17.) Concerning his testimonies I haue knowne them of old, that he hath founded them for euer: (Psal. 119.152.) The words which hee hath
commanded to a thousand generations. Which couenant hee made with ABRA∣HAM, and his oath vnto ISAAC, and confirmed the same vnto IACOB, for a law, and vnto ISRAEL for an euerlasting Covenant: (Psal. 105.8.) For th saith the Lord, If yee can breake my Covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there shall not be day, and nght, in their seasons; then may also my Cove∣nant bee broken: (Ier. 33.20) I haue sworne by my selfe; the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousnesse, and shall not returne: Isa. 45.23.46, 10. 2, Cor. 1, 18 Ierem. 4, 28. Hos. 13, 14. Numb. 23, 20. 1 Sam. 12.22. Haggai, 2, 6. Num. 18, 19. Psal. 22, 6.105, 8. 117, 2.119, 90. 93, 5. Heb. 6, 17. Ob. I haue seene an end of all perfecti∣on? Psal. 119, 96. A. But his Commandement is ex∣ceeding large: (Psalm. 119, 96.) The strength of ISRAEL will not lye, nor repent: (1, Sam. 15, 29.) When your Father, and Mother forsake
you, then the LORD will take you vp: (Psal. 27, 10.) For GOD is not as Man, that hee should lye; or the Sonne of man that hee should repent: Num. 23 19. Lift vp your eyes to the Heavens, and looke vpon the Earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoake, and the earth shall waxe old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall dye in like manner; but my Salvation shall bee for ever, and my Righteousnesse shall not be abolished: Isa. 51, 6.40, 8. 2, Sam. 7, 24. Math. 24.35. Ob. Why? hath not GOD cast a∣way his ancient people the Iewes? A. GOD forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of ABRAHAM, of the Tribe of BENIAMIN. God hath not cast away his people, which hee fore∣knew, &c. But even at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of Grace: Rom. 11, 1, 5, 1. For what if some did not beleeue? Shall their vnbeliefe make the faith of GOD without effect? (Rom, 3.3.) And
haue they stumbled that they should fall? od forbid. But rather through their fall alvation is come to the Gentiles for to ovoke them to iealousie. Now if the ll of them bee the riches of the World; nd the diminishing of them, the riches of he Gentiles; how much more their ful∣esse? (Rom. 11, 11.) For afterwards hall the Children of ISRAEL returne, nd seeke the LORD their GOD, and DAVID theyr King; and shall feare the Lord, and his goodnesse, in the latter dayes: Hos. 3, 5. 2 Cor. 3, 15. Isa. 11, 12, 19, 24, 25 50, 1. Zach. 2, 12. Rom. 11, 20, 26, 28. verses. Ob. Though GOD should neuer al∣ter with vs, yet shall wee by our sinnes, breake Couenant with him. Isa. 63, 10. Exod. 32, 33. A. If you breake my Statutes, and keepe not my Commandements, then will I visite your transgression with the rod, and your iniquities with stripes; never∣thelesse, my loving kindnesse, I will not vtterly take from you, nor suffer my
faithfulnesse to faile. My Couenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once haue I sworne by my Holinesse, that I will not lie vnto David, His seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sunne before mee. It shall bee established for ever, as the Moone, and as a faithfull witnesse in Heaven: Psalm. 89, 30. 2, Sam. 7, 15. Numb. 23, 20. Q. What are the reasons of this vn∣changeable dealing of God towards his people? A. 1. Hee himselfe changeth not: (Mal. 3, 6.) He is the first, and with the last even the same: Isa. 41.4. 2 IESVS CHRIST also, the same ye∣sterday, and to day, and for ever: Heb. 13, 8. 3 Whom he once loveth, he loveth vn∣to the end: (Ioh. 13.1.) Who is the LORD GOD of your Fathers, the God of Abra∣ham, the God of Iaac, and the God of Ia∣cob; this is his name for ever, and this is his memoriall, vnto all Generations:
Exod. 3, 15. Isay, 49, 1. 4 The gifts and callings of GOD, are ithout repentance: Rom. 11, 29. Q. What would you inferre vpon this nchangeablenesse in GOD? A. Say not thou, what is the cause that the former dayes were better than these; for thou dost not enquire wsely concerning this: Eccl 7, 10. 2 Therefore my beloved brethren; bee yee stedfast, vnmoueable, alwayes aboun∣ding in the worke of the Lord: for as much as you know, that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord: (1, Cor. 15, 58.) And turne yee not aside; for then shall yee goe after vaine things, which cannot profit, nor deliver you; for they are vaine: 1, Sam. 12, 21. Q. Why? Is God able to make his word good? A, Behold, saith GOD, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is there any thing too hard for me? (Ier. 32, 27.) The Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disanull it? And his hand is stretched out,
and who shall turne it backe? (Isa. 14 27.) The voyce of the LORD is powerfull; the voyce of the Lord is full of Maiestie; the voyce of the Lord breaketh the Cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Le∣banon, (Psal. 29.4.) neither by arme, nor strength; but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hostes: (Zach. 4, 6.) Yea whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did hee in Heaven, and in Earth, and in all deepe places: Psal. 135, 6. And now behold, the Lords hand is not shortened, that in cannot saue, neither is his eare heavie, that it cannot heare: (Isa. 59, 1.) And though it be marvei∣lous in the eyes of the remnant of his peo∣ple, in these dayes; shall it also be marvei∣lous in my eyes, saith the LORD of hostes? Zach. 8, 6. Gen. 18, 14. Isa. 40, 26, 48, 13, 50, 2, 3, 43, 13. 1 Ioh. 4, 4. Mark. 10, 27. Q. What shall wee then say to these things? Rom. 8.31. A. 1 Ascribe yee strength vnto GOD, his excellencie is over Israel, and his
strength is in the Clouds: Psal. 68, 34. 2 Pray, saying; Thou O GOD, who commandest our Strength, strenghen O God that which thou hast wrought for vs: Psal. 68, 28. 3 Because I know whatsoever GOD doth it shall be for ever; nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: (Eccles. 3, 14.) If GOD be for vs, who can be against vs? (Rom. 8 13.) There∣fore against hope, beleeue in hope, not staggering at the Promise, through vn∣beliefe, &c. But bring strong in the Faith, let vs giue glory to GOD: being fully perswaded, that what hee hath promi∣sed, hee  able also to performe: Rm. 4, 18 20. Eccles. 3, 14. Psal. 62, 10, 1. Gen. 17, 1.
CHAP. L. The objects of the Promises. Q. I Know now that GOD can doe every thing: (Iob 42, 2.) What therefore is required at my hands, that all things also may bee possible vnto mee? A. As thou beleevest, so it shall be done vnto thee: (Math. 8, 13.) And if thou canst beleeue, all things are possible, to him that beleeveth: (Mark. 9, 23.) For whatsoever things were written afore∣time, were written for our learning; that wee through Faith, and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope: (Rom. 15, 4.) And that the blessing of ABRAHAM, might come on the Gentiles, through IESVS CHRIST; that wee might re∣ceiue the promise of the Spirit, through Faith: (Gal. 3, 14.) So then they which hee of Faith, are blessed with faithfull
ABRAHAM: (Gal. 3.9.) For the Scrip∣ture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by the Faith of IESVS CHRIST, might be given to them that beleeue: (Gal. 3, 22) Blessed therefore, is hee that beleeveth, for there shall bee a performance of those things which were told him from the LORD: Luk. 1, 45. Habac. 2, 4. 1 Tim. 4, 10. Psal. 34, 8. Hebr. 11, 29. Ierem. 17, 5. Dan. 6, 23. 2 Hold the mysterie of the Faith, in a pure Conscience: (1 Tim. 3.9.) For bodily exercise profiteth little, but God∣linesse, is profitable vnto all things; ha∣ving the Promises of the life that now is, and of that which is to come: (1, Tim. 4.8.) Hee therefore that hath cleane hands, and a pure heart, who hath not lifted vp his Soule vnto vanitie, nor sworne deceitfully; hee shall receiue the blessing from the LORD, and righte∣ousnesse from the GOD of his Salvation: (Psalm. 24, 4.) For the Lord GOD is a Sonne, and a shield, the LORD will
giue Grace, and Glory, and no good thing will hee with-hold from them that walke vprightly: (Psal. 84.11.) Know there∣fore that the LORD thy GOD, hee is God the faithfull God which keepeth, Cove∣nant, and Mercy, with them that loue him, and keepe his Commandements, to a thou∣sand generations: (Deut. 7, 9.) For the righteous LORD, loveth Righteousnesse, his Countenance doth behold the vpright: (Psal. 11, 7.) And therefore, blessed are they which keepe Iudgement, and he that doth Righteousnesse at all times: Psal. 106, 3. 119, 1. 73, 1. Prou. 12, 28.16, 7.14, 27. Isa. 58, 13.56, 2. Deut. 7, 12. 1 King. 6, 12. Ioh. 13, 17. Exod. 39 43. Psal. 4, 3. Ob. I haue long liued in want not∣withstanding all my care, and indeauour in the study, and practise of Godlinesse: Iob, 35, 3. A. But are there not with you, even with you, sinnes against the Lord your God? (2, Chro. 28, 10) For GOD is good, and doth good: (Psal. 119, 68.) And with∣draweth not his eyes from the Righteous: Ib, 36, 7. Psal. 125, 4.
O thou therefore that art named the house of IACOB, is the spirit of the Lord straitned? Are these his doings? Doe not my words doe good to him that walketh vp∣rightly, saith the Lord? (Micha, 2, 7) All the pathes of the Lord, are Mercy, and Truth vnto such as keepe hs Commande∣ments, and his testimonies: Psal 25, 10. To the pure all things are pure▪ but vnto them that are defiled is nothing pure: (Titus, 1, 15.) For the hand of our GOD is vpon all them for good that seeke him; but his power; and his wrath, is against them that forsake him: Ezra, 8, 22. 2 Chron. 19, 11. Q. What vse then are wee to make hereof? A. 1 Take heed therefore brethren, least there be in any of you, an evill heart, of vnbeliefe, in departing from the living GOD: (Heb. 3.12.) For to whom sware hee that they should not enter into his rest; but to them that beleeved not? So we see then, that they could not enter in, because of vnbeliefe: (Heb. 3, 18.) Let vs there∣fore
feare, least a promise being left vs of entring into his rest, any of you should seeme to come short of it: (Heb. 4, 1.) For hee that commeth to GOD, must beleeue that GOD is; and that hee is a rewarder of them, that diligently seeke him: (Heb. 11, 6.) Here mee therefore, O IVDAH, and yee inhabitants of Ierusalem; beleeue in the Lord your GOD, so shall yee be esta∣blished; beleeue his Prophets, so shall yee prosper: (2, Chron. 20, 20.) For these things are written, that yee might beleeue that IESVS is CHRIST the Son of GOD; and in believing, yee might haue life through him: Io. 20.3. Now the GOD of hope fill you with all ioy, and peace in believing, that yee may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost: Rom. 15, 13. 2 Having therefore these Promises, (dearely beloved) let vs cleanse our selues, from all filthinesse of the Flesh, and Spi∣rit; perfecting holinesse, in the feare of GOD: (2, Corinth. 7.1.) And bee not conformed to this World; but bee
yee transformed, by the renewing of your mind; that yee may prooue, what is that good, that acceptable, and perfect will of GOD: (Rom. 12, 2.) And he that will loue Life, and see good dayes: let him re∣fraine his tongue from evill, and his lippes that they speake no guile. Let him eschew evill, and doe good, let him seeke peace, and pursue it: (1, Pet. 3, 10.) For this is a faithfull saying, and these things I will, that thou affirme constantly, that they which haue beleeved in GOD, might bee carefull to maintaine good Workes; for these things are good, and profita∣ble vnto Men: (Titus, 3, 8.) Obserue therefore, and heare all these things, which I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy Children after thee for ever; when thou doest that which is good, and right in the sight of the Lord thy GOD: Deut. 12, 28.6, 17, 18, 4, 39, 40. 10, 12, 13. Iosh. 3, 5. Therefore giue diligence, to adde to your Faith, vertue; and to Vertue, knowledge; and to Knowledge, temperance; and to
Temperance, patience and to Patience, godlinesse; and to Godlnesse, brotherly kindnesse; and to Brotherly kindnesse, Charitie: (2. Pet. 1, 5.) And let vs heare the conclusion of the whole matter; feare GOD, and keepe his Commandements; for this is the whole duty of Man: (Eccles. 12, 1.) Which if yee doe, yee shall never fall: 2, Pet 1.10. Now if it seeme evill vnto you to serue the Lord, choose you, this day whom yee will serue &c. But as for me, and my house wee will serue the LORD: Ish. 24 1.) For all people every one wll walke in the name of his GOD, and wee will walke in the name of the Lord our GOD, for ever, and ever: Mcha, 4, 5. O house of IACOB, come yee also, and walke in the light of the Lord: (Isa. 2, 5.) Provoking one another vnto Loue, and good Workes: (Heb. 10, 24) And ex∣horting one another daily, while it is called to day: Heb. 3, 13.
CHAP. LI. Of the Wicked, and of their Reward. Q MAy it bee expected that all should be mooued by these promises, vnto the exercise of faith, and, new obedience? A. Nothing lesse; for there are some who walke after their owne vngodly Lusts; these be they, who seperate themselues sen∣suall, having not the Spirit: (Iud. 18.) Of whom I haue told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are Ene∣mies to the Crosse of CHRIST: (Phil. 3, 18.) For as they that are after the spirit, doe mind the things of the Spirit; so these being after the flesh, the things of the flesh. Because their carnall mind, is enmi∣tie against GOD; for it is not subiect to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can be: (Rom. 8, 5.7.) But are wicked and sin∣ners before the Lord: (Gen. 13, 13.) Re∣belling
against the Commandement of the LORD their GOD, not beleeving, nor hear∣kening to his voice: (Deut. 9, 23.) They are corrupt, and haue done abhominable works: (Psal. 14, 1.) I haue called them transgres∣sours, from the wombe: (Isa. 48.8.) A per∣verse and crooked generation: (Deut. 32, 5.20.) Their vine is of the vine of Sodome, and of the fields of Gomorah; their grapes are the grapes of gall, their clusters are bit∣ter: their wine is the poyson of Dragons, & the cruell venome of Aspes: Deut. 32, 32. Behold their sinne is come before mee: (Iona. 1, 2.) And I am pressed vnder them, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues: (Amos, 2, 13.) And their sinnes are written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond; and it is graven vpon the tables of their hearts, and vpon the hornes of their Altars: (Ier. 17, 1.) They haue a whorish fore-head; they will not be ashamed: (Ier. 3, 3.) But are obsti∣nate, and their necke is an iron sinew, and their brow brasse: (Isa. 48, 4.) For they haue sold themselues to worke wic∣kednesse
in the sight of the LORD: (1, King. 21, 20.) GOD is not in all theyr thoughts: Psal. 10.4. And though I earnestly protested vnto their Fathers, rising early, and protesting saying; Obey my voice; yet they obeyed not, nor enclined their eare; but walked, every one in the imagination of their owne evill heart: Ier. 11, 7. Ezek. 16.49. Ier. 44.9, 16, 11. Gen. 38.7. Exod. 5, 2.14.11.15.24.16, 3, 17.2.32.7. Iudg. 2.11. Psal. 53.2.78.10. Prou. 21.10. Hos. 10, 4. Q. Is there no reward for such men as these from God? A. Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange punishment to the workers of ini∣quitie? (Iob. 31, 3.) The great God, that formed all things, both rewardeth the foole, and rewardeth the transgressours: (Prou. 26, 10.) According to his wayes, and ac∣cording to his doings will hee recompence him: (Hos. 12, 2.) The transgressours shall bee destroyed together, and the end of the wicked shall be cut off: (Psalm. 37.38.)
GOD shall raine snares fire, and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall bee the portion of their Cup: (Psal. 11, 6.) And the heritage appointed vnto them by God: (Iob. 20 9.) For is not this laid vp in store with mee, and sealed vp among my treasures saith the Lord? (Deu. 32, 34.) Even as I haue seene, they that plow ini∣quity, and sow wickednesse, reape the same: (Iob. 4.8.) Trouble and anguish shall make them afraid; they shall prevaile against them, as a King ready to the battell: (Iob. 15.24.) And I will feed them with worme∣wood, and giue them water of gall to drinke: (Ier. 9.15.) Yea, I will bring such evill vpon them, that whosoever heareth of it, both his eares shall tingle: (2, King. 21, 11.) And if they will not for all this hear∣ken vnto me, then I will punish them seven times more for their sinnes: (Leu. 26, 18.) And if they walke contrary vnto mee, and will not hearken vnto me, I will bring se∣ven times more plagues vpon them, accor∣ding to their sinnes, &c. And if they will not be reformed by these things, but will
walke contrary to me, then will I also walke ntrary to them, and will yet punish them ven times more for their sinnes: Leu. 6, 21.) Terrours shall take hold of them  waters; a tempest stealeth them away as  the night: (Iob. 27, 20.) And hey shall e no more, and though they be sought for, et shall they never be found, saith the Lord God: Ezek. 26, 21. Isa. 9, 18.1, 25. Deu. 32, 22.28, 16.19, 20. Zeph. 1, 14. Ezek. 24, 10. Pro. 22, 8 Hos. 7, 13, 9 9. Ier. 6, 11.15. 2.22.8.23.10.48.13.15.5. 1 Sam. 2, 10, Iob. 4, 20.18.11. Isa. 4 17. Amos, 5, 18.8 3. Nahum, 1, 9. Ezek. 21.6. Deut. 28.20. Ioel. 2.26. Amos. 5.24. Psalm. 68.21. Behold therefore, I set before you this day a blessing, and a curse: a blessing if yee obey the Commandements of the LORD your GOD; which I command you this day; and a curse if yee will not obey the Commandement of the Lord your GOD; but turne aside out of the way, which I command you this day, to goe after other Gods, which yee haue not knowne: Deut. 11.26, 30.15.
Who is wise, and he shall vnderstand these things? Prudent, and he shall know them? For the wayes of the LORD are right, and the iust shall walke in them; but the transgressours shall fall therein: Hos. 14.9. 1, Cor. 10, 6. Prou. 10.6, 19.16, 12. 2, 3.12, 7, 13.6, 21, 12, 12, 21, ver. Psal. 32, 10. Ob. Whatsoeuer you Ministers say, I am become rich, I haue found mee out sub∣stance in all my labours: (Hos. 12.8.) Nei∣ther shall evill come vpon me. And there∣fore the Prophets shall become wind, and the Word is not in them: Ier. 5, 13. A. Because sentence against an evill worke is not speedily executed, therefore the heart of the Sonnes of men, is fully set in them to doe evill: (Eccl. 8.11.) The Storke in the Heavens knoweth her appoin∣ted times and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow, obserue the times of their comming, but this people know not the iudg∣ments of the LORD: (Ier. 8.7.) They will not behold his high hand; but they shall see it, and be confounded: Isa. 26, 11.
The LORD indeed is flow to anger; but he is great in power, and will not surely leere the wicked: (Nah. 1, 3.) For will a Fowler take vp the snare from the Earth, and haue taken nothing at all? (Amos, 3, ,) Your fathers where are they? And the Prophets doe they liue for ever? But my words, and my statutes which I commanded my Servants the Prophets did they not take hold of your Fathers? And they returned, and said; like as the Lord of Hosts thought to doe vnto vs, according to our wayes, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with vs: (Zach. 1, 5.) And despisest thou the riches of his goodnesse, and forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodnesse of GOD, leadeth thee to Repen∣tance? But after thy hardnesse, and impe∣nitent heart, that cannot repent, treasurest vp to thy selfe wrath, against the day of wrath, and Revelation of the righte∣ous Iudgement of GOD: Romanes, 2, 4. Take heed therefore, least there should be among you, a Roote that beareth
gall and wormewood. And it commeth to passe when hee heareth the words of this curse, that hee blesse himselfe in his heart, saying; I shall haue peace, though I walke in the imagination of mine heart; to adde drunkennesse to thirst; the Lord will not spare him; but then the anger of the Lord, and his iealousie, shall smoake against that man: and all the curses that are written in this booke, shall lie vpn him: and the LORD shall blot out his name from vnder Heaven: Deut. 29.18. Isa. 47, 7.57.11. Ezek. 21.9. Amos 6 3 9.10. Psal. 50.18. Iosh. 23, 15. Zeph. 2, 15.1.12. Isa. 28.17. Zach. 1, 15. Happy therefore is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardneth his heart, shall fall into mischiefe: (Prou. 28.14.) The wise mans eyes are in his head: but the foole walketh in darknesse: (Eccl. 2, 14.) The prudent man foreseeth the evill, and hideth himselfe but the wicked passe on and are punished: (Prou. 27, 12.) A wise man fea∣reth, and departeth from evill: but the foole rageth and is confident: Prou 14.16.22, 3.
CHAP. LII. The Wicked Convinced of sinne. Ob. THese Iudgements may be∣fall Heathens, and such as are without; but wee are the people of GOD, with whom the Lord hath made a Covenant of Peace; and therefore none of these things shall befall vs. A. The Lord is with you, while yee bee with him; and if yee seeke him, he will bee found of you; but if yee forsake him, he will forsake you: (2, Chron. 15.2.) For at what instant I shall speake concerning a Na∣tion, and concerning a Kingdome, to build, and to plant it; if it doe evill in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them: (Ier. 18, 9.) And the punishment of the iniquity of the Daughter of my people, is greater, than the punishment of the sinne of Sodome, that was overthrowne in a moment: Lam. 4, 6.
Wherefore trust ye not in lying words, saying; The Temple of the LORD, the Temple of the LORD, the Temple of the LORD, are these: (Ier. 7.4.) But goe yee now vnto my place which was in Shilo, where I set my name at the beginning, and behold what I did to it, for the wickednesse of my people Israel: (Ier. 7,12.) For so will I make this House like Shilo, and make this Citie a curse to all Nati∣ons of the Earth: Ier. 26.6. 1. King. 9.6. Exod. 32, 35. Isa. 57.3.4. Deutr. 8.19. Ob. We doe not onely liue in the Church, but by Baptisme are made members of the same? A. Baptisme, verily profiteth, if thou keepe the law; but if thou bee a breaker of the Law, thy Baptism is made no Bap∣tisme: (Rom. 2, 25.) Circumcision is no∣thing; and Vncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the Commandements of GOD: 1, Cor. 7, 19. It is  that Aegypt, and Iudah, and Edome, and the Children of Ammon, and
Moab, even all these Nations are vncir∣cumcised, and thou art vncircumcised in heart: (Ier. 9.25.) And therefore thou shalt die the deaths of the vncircumcised, by the hand of the strangers; for I haue spoken it, saith the LORD GOD: Ezek. 28, 10. 1, Cor. 10.1. Ob. I haue not only bin entred, and in∣rolled a member of the Church, but al∣so haue ioyned with others in the wor∣ship of GOD, and in the profession of the same: Iudg. 17.3. Isa 58.3. A. There is a generation that are pure in their owne eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthinesse: (Prou. 30.12.) Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offe∣rings and Sacrifices, as in obeying his voice? Behold to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of Rams: (1, Sam. 15.22.) The Sacrifices of the wicked is abhomination to the Lord; but the Pray∣er of the vpright is his delight: Prou. 15. 8.21.27. Iam. 1.27. But vnto the wicked saith God; what hast thou to doe to declare my Statutes,
or that thou shouldest take my Covenant within thy mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee: (Psal. 50, 16.) For the LORD loveth Iudgement, and hateth Robberie for burnt offerings: (Isa. 61, 8) Where∣fore let no man deceiue you, hee that doth righteousnesse is righteous, as he is righte∣ous; but he that committeth sinne is of the Divell: 1, Ioh. 3, 7. Hag. 2, 11, 12. Isa. 29 1.58.4, 66, 3, 1, 11. Amos, 2, 8.5, 25, 21. Leu. 26, 31. Zch. 7, 5 Mal, 1, 7, 1, 13. Ier. 6.20, 7, 22, 14.12. Psal. 50, 9, 40 6. Hos. 6, 6, 4, 19. Mark. 12, 33. Luk. 11.41. Ob. Blessed be thou of the LORD, for I haue kept the Commandements of GOD, (1, Sam. 15, 13.) Haue done many things; (Mark 6, 20.) And haue been zealous for the Lord of Hosts. 2, Kin. 10.16, Hos. 12, 8. A. What meaneth then this bleating of the sheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the Oxen which I heare? (1, Sam. 15.14.) For in thee haue they set light by Father, and Mother; in the middest of thee haue they dealt by oppression with the stranger;
in hee haue they vexed the Fatherlesse, and he Widdow. Thou hast despised my Holy things, and hast prophaned my Sabbaths. In thee are Men to carry tales to shedde bloud: in the middest of thee they com∣mit Lewdnesse: (Ezek. 22, 7.) Where∣fore I haue a few things against thee: (Revel. 2.20.) As well as against IS∣RAEL, who feared the LORD, and made vnto themselues, the lowest of them Priests of the High-places. They feared GOD, the LORD, and served their owne Gods; they feared not the Lord: (2, King. 17, 32.) For the feare of the LORD is to hate evill, as pride, & arrogancy, and every evll way: (Prou. 8, 13.) And therefore, cursed art thou, if thou confirme not all the words of this Law to doe them; and all the people shall say, Amen: Deut. 27, 26, 4, 2.6.17.12.32.18.13. Iam. 1, 26, 2.10.3, 9, 10. Ezek. 18, 10. 2, Cor. 8, 1. 2, King. 22.2. Ob. I deny not, but doe freely con∣fesse, Murther, and Adultery to be grie∣vous sins, deseruing death; now then, if I
can acquit my selfe of such sinnes, I shall doe well enough? A. You haue heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the iudgment. But I say vnto you, that whosoe∣ver is angry with his brother, without a cause, shall be in danger of the iudgement: and whosoever shall say to his Brother Ra∣cha, shall bee in danger of a Counsell; and whosoever shall say thou Foole, shall be in danger of Hell fire. You haue heard also, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adultery. But I say vn∣to you, that whosoever looketh on a wo∣man to lust after her, hath committed A∣dultery with her already in his heart: (Math. 5, 21, 27. ver.) And for every idle word, that men shall speake, they shall giue an account thereof in the day of Iudgement: Math. 12, 36. Ezek. 16.49. 1, Chron. 13.9.2.32.24. 1, Sam. 6.19. 1, King. 20 35. Numb. 20.12. Deut. 32.50. Ob. What a precisesse call you this? For what if now, and then I meeting
with a good fellow, or two, doe make my selfe merry with them, and doe follow some other trickes of youth? A. Wo be vnto you that call evill good, and good evill that put darknesse for light, and light for darknesse: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter: Isa. 5.20. You are they which iustifie your selues before men; but GOD knoweth the hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abhominable in the sight of GOD: (Luk. 16, 15.) The shew of your Counte∣nance doth witnesse against you, and you declare your sinne as Sodome, and hide it not: woe vnto you, for you haue rewarded evill vnto your selues: Isa. 3.9. Ier. 6.15. 2.35. Prou. 14.12.16.25. Ob. You are very rash in iudging; for who but God knoweth the heart? A. Doth not the Eare try words? And the mouth tast his meat? (Iob. 12.11.34.3.) Even a Child is knowne by his doings, whether his worke be pure, and whether it be right: (Prou. 20.11.) For doth a Foun∣taine
send foorth at the same place sweet water, and bitter? Can a Figge-tree beare Oliue berries? Either a Vine, Figges? So can no Fountaine yeild salt water, and fresh: Iam. 3, 11. Luk. 6, 43. Math. 12, 33, 7.16. Ob. Notwithstanding your shew of precisenesse, if your faults were written in your forehead, we should haue much worse things to say of you. A. Speake not evill one of ano∣ther (Brethren) he that speaketh evill of his Brother, and iudgeth his Brother, speaketh evill of the law, and iudgeth the law: but if thou iudge the Law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a Iudge. There is one Lawgiuer, who is able to saue and to destroy, who art thou that iudgest another? (Iam. 4, 11.) Iudge not, that yee be not iudg∣ed. For with what iudgement yee iudge, yee shall be iudged; and with what mea∣sure yee mete, it shall be measured to you a∣gaine: Math. 7, 1. Ob Thou seemest to restraine wisdome to thy selfe; but what knowest thou that we
know not? Or what vnderstandest thou that is not in vs? Iob, 15, 8.15, 2. A. If yee know these things, happie re yee if yee doe them: (Ioh. 13, 17.) Thy Father iudged the cause of the poore, and needy, then it was well with him; was ot this to know me, saith the LORD? (Ier. 22, 16.) For behold the feare of the LORD that is Wisedome, and to depart from evill is vnderstanding: (Iob, 28, 28.) You professe you know him, but in Workes you deny him, being abominable, and vnto every good worke reprobate: Titus, 1, 16. And how doe yee say wee are wise, and the law of the Lord is with vs? Yee haue reiected the Word of the Lord, nnd what wisdome is in you? Ier. 8, 8.5, 4. Iam. 3, 13. Prou. 3, 17. Luk. 12, 47. Iam. 4, 16, 3, 17. Rom. 2, 17. 1 Ioh. 2, 4. Ioh. 15, 22, 9, 1.

CHAP. LIII. The wicked Convinced of judgement. Ob. IT should seeme this man hath seene some vision, or hath had some other extraordinary reuelati∣on: Therefore watch man, what of the night? Watchman what of the night? Isa. 21.11. A. The watch-man said; The mor∣ning commeth, and also the night; (Isa. 21, 12.) And are yee come to inquire of mee? As I liue, saith the Lord GOD, I will not bee inquired of by you: (Ezek. 20, 3.) Beware yee despisers and wonder, and perish; for I worke a worke in your dayes, a worke which yee shall in no wise beleeue, though a man declare it vnto you: (Acts, 13, 40. Habac. 1, 5.) Now therefore bee not mockers, least your hands bee made
strong, for I haue heard from the LORD GOD of hostes, a consumption, even determined vpon the whole Earth. Giue yee eare, and heare my voyce, hearken and heare my speech: (Isa. 28, 22.) Then said I; Ah, LORD GOD, they say of mee; Doth hee not speake parables? Ezek. 2 49. 14, 7. Ob. But when went the Spirit of the LORD, from our Ministers vnto thee? (1. King. 22, 24.) Who doe say to vs, yee shall not see the Sword, neither shall yee haue Famine; but the LORD will giue you assured peace in this place: Ierem. 14, 13.23, 18, 18, 18.23, 17. 1, King. 18, 17. A. AMEN, the LORD doe so; the Lord performe the words that they haue spoken: (Ierem 28, 6.) As for me, I haue not hastened from being a Pastor to follow thee, neither haue I desired the wofull day, thou knowest; that which came out of my lippes, was right before thee: Ier. 17, 16.
And as for your Ministers, if any of them thinke himselfe to bee a Pro∣phet, and Spirituall, let him acknow∣ledge, that the things that I write vn∣to you, are the Commandements of the LORD; but if any man bee ignorant, let him bee ignorant: (1, Corinth. 14, 37.) But let no man deceiue you with vaine words; for because of these shings, commeth the wrath GOD, vpon the Children of disobedience: Ephes. 5, 6. Your Prophets, prophecie lyes, in my Name, I sent them not, neyther haue I commaunded them, neither spake vnto them; they Prophesied vnto you a false vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus saith the LORD con∣cerning the Prophets, that prophecie in my Name, and I sent them not; yet they say, Sword, and Famine, shall not bee in this land; by sword, and famine shall those Prophets bee consumed. And the people to whom they Prophesied shall
bee cast out into the streets of Ierusalem, because of the Famine, and the Sword, and they shall haue none to bury them; for I will powre theyr wickednesse vpon them: (Ierem. 14, 14.) And when the words of the Prophets shall come to passe, then shall you know, that the LORD hath truly sent him: Ierem. 28, 9.50, 30.31, 23, 19.23.25.23.30.28.15. Ezek. 14, 9.13, 6.13, 22. Hosea, 4.9.9.7.8. Isa. 29.9.42.19. 1. King. 22, 23.25. Isa. 3, 12. Ob. I thinke you will neuer giue o∣uer these threatning words, giue mee such a Minister, as will preach comfor∣table things vnto vs. A. Am I therefore become your ene∣mie, because I tell you the Truth? Gal. 4, 16. As for these Ministers, they haue healed your hurt with sweet words, say∣ing; Peace, peace, when there is no peace. (Ierem. 8.11.) And if a man walking in the spirit, and falshood, and doe lye,
saying; I will Prophecie vnto thee of wine and strong drinke; hee shall bee even the Prophet of this people: Micha, 2, 11. Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the Prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy Mo∣ther: Hos. 4, 5. 1 King. 18, 18. Isa. 30.8. Hos. 4 4. Ob. Though these Iudgments you threaten, be certaine, yet they may not bee neere; (Ezek. 11, 3.) But the vision, may bee for many dayes to come, and you Prophecie of the times that are farre off: Ezk. 12, 27. A. Who is like mee? And who will appoint mee the time, saith the LORD? (Ierem. 49, 19.) Therefore, thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words bee prolonged any more; but the word which I haue spoken, shall bee done, saith the Lord GOD: (Ezek. 12, 28) Yea, eue in your dayes, O rebellious house will I say the thing, and will performe it: (Ezk. 12, 25.) Hee shall come as an
Eagle to the house of the LORD: (Hos, 8, 1.) And hee will bee a swift witnesse against such scorners: (Malac. 3, 5.) For the dayes of visitations are come, the dayes of recompence are come: (Hosea, 9, 7.) It shall bee in a moment, even sodainly, (Isa. 29.5) as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking commeth sodainly, at an instant: (Isa. 30, 13.) For no man knoweth his time; but as the Fishes that are taken in an evill net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sonnes of Men snared in an evill time, when it falleth sodainly vpon them: Eccles. 9.12. Amos, 9, 10, 8, 1, 2. Zeph. 1, 14. Deut. 32, 35. Isa. 47, 11. Ierem. 1, 12.48, 16.50.31.51.33. Lam. 4, 18.22. Ezek. 7, 12, 21.9. Hos. 4.19. Ioel, 2, 1. Gen. 19, 24. Dan. 5, 3, 30. Ob. If the worst things doe fall, yet haue I many meanes, to guard, and to defend mee from the same.
A. O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the Cedars how gracious shalt thou be, when Pangs come vpon thee, as the paine of a woman in trauell? (Ierem, 22.23.) The pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the Rocke, whose habi∣tation is high; that saith in his heart, who shall bring mee downe to the ground? Though thou exaltest thy selfe as the Eagle, and though thou set thy nest a∣mong the Starres, thence will I bring thee downe, saith the LORD: (Obad. 3, 4.) Your silver, and your gold shall not bee able to deliver you in the day of the wrath of the LORD: (Ezek. 7, 19.) The Lord is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who hath hardened him∣selfe against him, and prospered? Iob, 9, 4. Prou. 10.2.11.4. Ezek. 28.4, 7, 19. Zeph. 1.18. Zach. 9.3. Ier. 49.4. 4.30. Hab. 2.9. Ob. If our owne power be too weake, wee haue multitudes of allies, and many
good friends will stand by, and suc∣cour vs? A. EPHRAIM is fed with the Wind, and followeth after the East-wind: (Hos. 12.1.) For though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked shall not be vnpunished: Prou. 16, 5. And how say yee then, wee are mighty, and haue strong men for the Warre? (Ier. 48, 14.) Art thou better than populous No, that was scituate among the Rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose Rampart was the Sea, and her Wall was from the Sea? Nahum, 3, 8. Yee haue plowed wickednesse, yee haue reaped iniquitie, yee haue eaten the fruit of lyes; for because thou didst trust in the multitude of thy mighty men; therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy Fortresses shall bee spoyled: (Hos. 10.13.) When also thy lovers will despise thee, and will seeke thy life: (Ir. 4.30.) Your hired men shall bee
turned backe, and flie away together: (Ier. 46.21.) And the multitude of thy strangers shall bee like the small dust, and the multitude of thy terrible ones, shall bee as the Chaffe, that passeth away, (Isa. 9, 5.) And you shall bee asha∣med of a people, that could not profit you; nor bee an helpe, nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproch. For they shall helpe in vaine, and to no purpose therefore haue I cryed concerning this their strength is to sit still: (Isa. 30 5, 7. Wherefore cease yee from Man, whose breath is in his nosthrels; for where∣in is hee to bee accounted of? Isa. 2.22. 1, Cor. 10.22. Isa. 8.6.57.13. Iob. 36.19, 15.31. 2, Samuel, 16, 23.2, 17.14. Ier. 18.. Ob. If wee cannot with safety stand out against these Iudgements, wee will then flye from them, and they shall not overtake vs: Isaiah, 30.16. A. Am I a GOD at hand, saith the LORD, and not a GOD a farre off?
(Ier. 23.23.) Whether will yee goe from his spirit? Or whether will yee flee from his presence: Psal, 139.7. He which fleeth of you, shall not flee a∣way; and hee that escapeth of you, shall not bee delivered: (Amos, 9, 1.) But it shall be with you, as if a man did flye from a Lion and a Beare met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a Serpent bit him: Amos, 5, 19. Isa. 30.16. Amos 2, 14. Ob. If we cannot escape by flying, we will then hide our selues in some darke Corner of the earth: Iob. 22, 12, 13. Psal. 94.7, Isa. 29, 15. A. I know Ephraim, saith GOD, and Is∣rael is not hid from me: (Hos. 5, 3.) Nei∣ther is there any creature which is not ma∣nifest in his sight; but all things are naked, and open vnto the eyes of him, with whom we haue to doe: (Heb. 4.13.) Whereby it shall come to passe, that though you die into Hell, thence shall my hand take you; though you climbe vp to
Heaven, thence will I bring you downe, and though you hide your selues in the top of CARMEL, I will search, and take you out thence: and though you be hid from my sight in the bottome of the Sea, thence will I command the Serpent, and hee shall bite you: Amos. 9.2. Hos. 7, 2. Zach. 4. 10. Iob. 12.22. Ob. If this be our case, wee will then cease from open sinning against GOD; and what wee doe, wee will doe in such sort as no eye shall see vs? A. Woe vnto you, that seeke deepe to hide your Counsell from the LORD, and your workes are in the darke, and you say who seeth vs? And who knoweth vs? Surely your turning of things vpside downe, shall bee esteemed as the Potters clay: For shall the worke say of him that made it, hee made mee not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it; he had no vnderstanding? Isay, 29.15. You take Counsell, but not of me; and
you cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that you may adde sinne to sinne: (Isa. 30, 1.) But the spirit of man, is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly: (Prou. 20.27.) And his eyes behold his eye∣lids try the Children of men: (Psalm. 11.4.) To giue every Man according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his dooings: Ierem. 17, 10. Psalme, 139.2, &c. Ob. But will not a guift in the hand, pacifie Gods wrath? A. The LORD your GOD, is the GOD of Gods, and LORD of Lords, a great GOD; a mighty and a terrible; which regardeth not persons, nor taketh rewards: (Deut. 10, 17.) For every Beast of the Forrest is his, and the Cat∣tell vpon a thousand Hils. Hee knoweth all the Fowles of the Mountaines, and the wild Beasts of the Feild are his. If he were hungry he would not tell thee; for the world is his, and the fulnesse thereof: Psal. 50.10
Wherefore then doe you harden your hearts as the Aegyptians, and PHARAOH hardened their hearts: (1, Sam. 6, 6.) For because there is wrath, beware least hee take you away with his stroke; then a great ransome cannot deliver thee. Will hee esteeme thy riches? No not Gold, nor all the Forces of strength: Iob. 36, 18. Ob. Whatsoeuer you can say, I know that GODS mercies, doe surpasse the measure of our sinnes, and hee that made vs, will saue vs. A. He that made you will not haue mer∣cy on you, and hee that formed you will shew you no favour: (Isa. 27.11.) But it shall come to passe, when you heare the words of this curse, and you blesse your selues in your heart, saying; Wee shall haue peace, though wee walke in the imagination of our hearts, to adde Drunkennesse to thirst; the LORD will not spare you, but then the anger of the LORD, and his iealousie shall smoke
against you, and all the curses that are written in this booke, shall lye vpon you, and the Lord shall blot out your Name from vnder Heaven. Deut. 29.19. Ob. I know that God is not so much without pitty, but that if when trouble commeth, wee doe crie vnto him, hee will heare, and haue Mercie vpon vs. A. You shall then cry vnto the LORD indeed, but hee will not heare you; hee will even hide his face from you at that time, as you haue behaved your selues ill in your doings: (Micha, 3, 4.) And hee will say vnto you, goe, and cry vnto your GODS which yee haue chosen; let them deliver you in time of your Tribulation: Iudges, 10, 14. Not that the LORDS hand is shortned, that it cannot saue, neither his eare hea∣vie that it cannot heare. But your iniqui∣ties haue separated betweene you, and your GOD, and your sinnes,
haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare. For your hands are defiled with bloud, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips haue spoken lyes, your tongue hath muttered perversenesse: Isay, 59, 1. Wherfore behold, he will bring evill vp∣on you, which you shall not bee able to es∣cape, and though you cry vnto him, yet hee will not hearken vnto you: Ier. 11.11. Hosea. 5.6. Iudg. 11.7. Ier. 14.12.7.13. Ob. If Mercie cannot bee had for our owne sakes, yet by the Prayers, of the Righteous, and for their righte∣ousnesse sake, wee shall bee deliue∣red. A. Though these three men NOAH, DANIEL, and IOB were in it, they should deliver but there owne soules, by their righteousnesse, saith the LORD GOD: (Ezek. 14.14) And though MO∣SES and SAMVEL stood before mee, yet my mind could not be towards this people;
cast them out of my sight, and let them goe foorth: Ierem. 15.1. Therefore, they shall not pray for this people, nor lift vp crye or prayer for them, neither intreat mee, for I will not heare them, saith the LORD: Ierem. 7.16.14.11.11.14.15.5.16.5. Ob. But will GOD destroy the righ∣teous with the wicked? (Genes. 18.23.) Or shall one man sinne, and will hee bee wrath with all the Congregation? Numb. 16.22. A. Did not ACHAN commit a tres∣passe in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the Congregation of ISRAEL? And hee perished not alone in his Iniqui∣ty? Iosh. 22.20. 2. Chron. 28.19. Notwithstanding runne yee to and fro, through the streets of IERVSALEM, and see now, and know; and seeke in the broad places thereof, if yee can finde a man; if there bee any, that executeth Iudgement, that seeketh the Truth, and I will par∣don it: Ier. 5, 1.
But from the least of you to the greatest of you, every one is given to Covetousnesse; and from the Prophet e∣ven to the Priest, every one dealeth false∣ly: (Ieremiah, 6, 13.) The good Man is perished out of the Earth, and there is none vpright among them; they all lye in waite for bloud, they hunt every man his Brother with a Net: that they may doe e∣vill with both hands, earnestly. The Prince asketh, and the Iudge asketh for a Reward; and the Great man hee vttereth his mischievous desires; so they wrap it vp. The best of them is as a Brier; the most vpright is sharper than a thorne Hedge; therefore the day of thy Watch∣men, and thy Visitation commeth, now shall bee your perplexitie: Micha, 7, 2. Numbers, 16, 26. Ezekiel. 22.25.22.30. Ob. If I may be sure to escape so long vntill some common Iudgement come vpon our whole Land, I shall doe well enough.
A. If thou continue thus presumptu∣ously to sinne, the LORD shall sepa∣rate thee vnto evill, out of all the Tribes of ISRAEL, according to all the Curses of this Covenant, that are written in this booke of the Law: (Duteronomie, 29, 21.) As well as he did ACHAN who for his sinne, was by all ISRAEL stoned with stones, and his goods with all that hee had burned with fire: (Ioshua, 7, 25.) Woe therefore bee vnto thee, wilt thou not bee made cleane? When shall it once bee? Ieremiah, 13.27.
CHAP. LIIII. Of the Wicked Conver∣ted. Q. IF our sinne guiltinesse deserue such inevitable Iudgements, goe thou neere, and heare all that the LORD our GOD shall say, and speake thou vnto vs, all that the LORD our GOD shall speake vnto thee, and wee will heare it, and doe it: Deuteron. 5, 27. A. The LORD hath heard the voyce of your words, and said vnto mee; I haue heard the voyce of the words of this people, which they haue spoken vnto thee; they haue well said, all that they haue spo∣ken. O that there were such an heart in them, that they would feare mee, and keepe my Commandements alwayes, that it might bee well with them, and
with their Children for ever: Deuter. 5.28. But yee dissembled in your hearts, when yee sent me vnto the LORD your God, saying; Pray for vs vnto the LORD our GOD, and according to all that the LORD our GOD shall say, so declare vnto vs, and wee will doe it. And now I haue this day declared it vnto you; but yee doe not obey the voyce of the LORD your GOD, nor any thing, for the which hee hath sent me vnto you. Now therefore know certainly, that yee shall dye by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Pesti∣lence; in the place whether yee desire to goe, and to soiourne: (Ier. 42, 20.) For yee cannot serue the LORD; for hee is an holy GOD; he is a iealous God; he will not forge your transgressions, and sinnes: Ioshua, 24.19. How long then halt yee betweene two o∣pinions? If the LORD bee GOD fol∣low him; but if BAAL, then follow him: (1, King. 18.21.) And hearken
to mee, yee men of ENGLAND, that GOD also may hearken vnto you: (Iudg. 9.7.) Giue glorie to the Lord your GOD, before hee cause darknesse, and before your feet stumble vpon the darke Mountaines; while yee looke for light, hee turne it into the shadow of death, and make it grosse darknesse. But if yee will not heare it, my Soule shall weepe in secret places for your Pride, and mine eyes shall weepe sore, and runne downe with teares, because the LORDS Flocke is carried away captiue: Ierem. 13, 16. Q. Wee haue indeed, besides all other Sinnes, dissembled with the LORD; but now the Lord GOD of Gods, the Lord GOD of Gods hee know∣eth, (Iosh. 22, 22.) that him will wee serue, and his voyce will wee obey: (Iosh. 24.24.) The LORD bee a true, and faithfull witnesse betweene vs, if we doe not even according to all things, for the which the LORD thy
GOD shall send thee to vs. Whether it bee good, or whether it bee evill, wee will obey the voyce of the LORD our GOD, to whom wee send thee; that it may bee well with vs, when wee obey the voyce of the Lord our GOD: Ierem. 42, 5. Iosh. 24, 21, 24. A. Then gird your loynes, and la∣ment, yee Priests, howle yee Ministers of the Altar: come lye all night in Sack∣cloath, yee Ministers of my GOD, &c. Sanctifie yee a Fast, call a solemne Assem∣bly, gather the Elders, and all the inhabi∣tants of the Land, into the house of the LORD your GOD, and cry vnto the LORD: Ioel, 1, 13. Ier. 4.14, Zeph. 2, 1. Ioel 2, 12, 5. Iona, 3, 8. Ioel, 1, 13. Psal. 46, 8. Lam. 2, 14. Ioel, 2, 17. Iam. 4, 8. Saying, Wee acknowledge our wic∣kednesse, and the iniquities of our Fa∣thers; for wee haue sinned against thee: (Ierem. 14, 20.) Wee haue sinned, and haue committed iniquitie, and haue
done wickedly, and haue rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy Iudgements. Neither haue wee hear∣kened vnto thy servants the Prophets, which spake in thy Name, to our Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers, and to all the people of the Land. O LORD, righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs confusion of faces, as at this day; because of our trespasse, that wee haue trespassed against thee: (Dan. 9, 5.) O our GOD, wee are ashamed, and blush, to lift vp our face to thee, our GOD; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespasse is growne vp vnto the Hea∣vens. And now, O our GOD, what shall wee say after this? For wee haue forsaken thy Commandements: Ezra, 9, 6, 10. O LORD, wee beseech thee, let now thine eare bee attentiue to the Pray∣er of thy servants, who desire to feare thy Name, and doe confesse our sinnes
which we haue sinned against thee; both we and our fathers house haue sinned (Nehe. 1.11.16.) And haue gone astray like lost sheepe; therefore seeke thy seruants, for we will not forget thy Commandements: (Psalm. 119.176.) Turne vs againe, O GOD of hosts, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saued: (Psal. 80.7.) Doe thou incline our heart vnto thee, to walke in thy wayes, and to keepe thy Commande∣ments, and thy statutes, and thy Iudgements, which thou comman∣dedst our Fathers: (1. King. 8.58.) That which we see not teach thou vs; if wee haue done iniquitie wee will doe no more: Iob. 34, 32, 13, 23. Psalme, 80.18. Psalme, 143.8. 2 Doe you take hold of his strength, that you may make peace with him, and you shall make peace with him: (Isa. 27.5.) And thereby good shall come vnto thee: Iob. 22.21. And because no man commeth vnto the
Father, but by CHRIST: (Iohn, 14.6.) Nor vnto CHRIST, except the Father draw him: (Iohn, 6, 44,) Therefore pray, saying; Draw me, we will run after thee: Can. 1 4 3 Wash yee, make you cleane, put away the evill of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to doe evill, learne to doe well; seeke Iudgement, releeue the op∣pressed, iudge the Fatherlesse, plead for the Widdow. Come now, and let vs reason together saith the LORD; though your sinnes bee as scarlet, they shall bee as white as snow; though they bee red like Crimson, they shall bee as Wooll. (Isa. 1.16.) Yet the LORD will wait that he may haue mercy vpon you, and therefore will he bee exalted, that he may haue compassion vpon you; for the LORD is the GOD of Iudgement: Isa. 30, 18. Hosea, 13.9. Ezekiel, 33, 11. Zach. 1.3.8.16. Ier. 18, 11. Mal. 3.7. Psal. 4, 4. Eccl. 12.23. 1, King. 8, 61. Isa. 66, 1.2. 4 Beeing thus conuerted, you should
enter into a Covenant with the LORD your GOD, and into his oath, which the LORD your GOD shall make with you: so shall he establish you this day for a peo∣ple vnto himselfe, and be vnto you a God, as he hath said vnto you, and as hee hath swore vnto your Fathers: Deut. 29, 12. Nehemiah, 9.38. 2, Chronicles, 15.12.23.3. 2, Chronicl. 29.10.34.31. Ezra. 10.3. Q. Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken: (Isa. 39 8) Wee doe therefore enter into a Covenant, that we will be the Lords people: (2, Chron. 23.16.) And wee, our Wiues, our Sonnes, and our Daughters, even every one of vs, having knowledge and vnderstanding, doe heere enter into a Curse, and into an Oath to walke in GODS Law, which was given by MOSES, the Servant of GOD, and to obserue and doe all the Commandements of the LORD our GOD, and his Iudgements, and his Statutes: (Neh. 10.28.) The Lord our God will wee
serue, and his voice will wee obey: Iosh. 24.24. Nehem. 9.38. A. Then haue you delivered your selues, out of the hand of the Lord: (Iosh. 23, 31.) And as you haue avouched the LORD this day to bee your GOD, and to walke in his wayes, and to keepe his Sta∣tutes, and Commandements, and his iudg∣ments, and to hearken vnto his voyce; so the LORD hath avouched you this day to bee his peculiar people, as he hath promised you, and that you should keepe all his Com∣mandements, and to make you high aboue all Nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour, and that yee may be an holy people vnto the (LORD your GOD, as hee hath spoken: (Deuter. 26.17.) And these very stones shall bee a witnesse vnto you; for they haue heard all the words of the LORD, which hee hath spoken vnto you; they shall bee a witnesse vnto you, least yee deny your GOD: Ish. 24.27. For this cause, wee also will not cease to
pray for you, and to desire that yee may bee filled with the knowledge of his will, in all Wisedome, and spirituall vnderstanding: that yee may walke worthy of the LORD vnto all pleasing, beeing fruitfull vnto every good worke, and increasing in the knowledge of God: Col. 1, 9. Now the GOD of peace that brought againe from the dead, our LORD IE∣SVS, that great Shepheard, of the Sheepe, through the bloud of the everlasting Cove∣nant; make you perfect in every good worke, to doe his will; working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through IESVS CHRIST: (Heb. 13.20.) And our LORD IESVS CHRIST himselfe, and GOD, even our Father, which hath loved vs, and hath given vs everlasting consolation, and good hope through Grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word, and worke: 2, Thes. 2, 16. Now vnto him that is able to keepe you from falling, and to present you faultlesse,
before the presence of his glory, with excee∣ding ioy; to the onely wise GOD, and Sa∣viour, be Glory, and Maiesty, Dominion, and Power, now, and ever: Iud. 24. And now Brethren I commend you to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you vp, and to giue you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified: Acts, 20.32. The Grace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, bee with you all, Amen. Revel. 22.21. FINIS.
