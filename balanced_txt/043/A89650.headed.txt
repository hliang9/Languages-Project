News from the FLEET. Being a true Account of what has occurr'd therein since the Dutch Ships join'd them in their present Expedi∣tion for Brest. With a List of the English and Dutch Ships and Guns. Licensed July 24. 1689. J. F. From the Fleet at Sea near Ʋshant, July the 13th, 1689. SIR, I Have often remembered my Promise to you when last together, but could not find sufficient to trouble you with∣all, but now am resolved to let you know what is currant with us; First I have sent inclosed an exact List of the Fleet, that are joyned at this Minute, both of Dutch and English Men of War, with their Fire-ships, and their order they are to fight in. Next, on the 4th Instant the Happy-Return, Portsmouth, Dover, and Jersey-Frigats, were ordered by the Admiral to look into Brest-Harbor, to observe the French Fleet, with their number, &c. But on the 5th at brake of day, upon the Coast, they espi∣ed within Gun-shot of them a French Man of War of 18 Guns and 80 Men, (a prit∣ty Frigat capable of carrying 36 Guns; (more of this hereafter) but as soon as she saw our Guns fire, and felt our Shot, she made all the Sail she could to escape us, she being a prime Sayler: our Ships sayling well, more especially the Jersey-Frigat, who plyed her well with their Fore-chace, and sometimes with whole Broadsides, she sayling afore the Wind still, plying her Stern-Chace very briskly upon our Ships, cutting our Masts and Rigging, and ours hers, from three in the Morning, untill between twelve and one at Noon, when the Jersey Shot had the good Fortune to shoot his Main Top-Mast and Main-yard by the Board, upon which she immediate∣ly struck her Ancient, after having chaced her ten Leagues South-west in the Sea. The French Man of War's Name is La Villiee, Monsieur Pickerd Commander; she was a Fire-ship under the said Commander, at the Fight with the French upon the Coast of Ireland, but she being almost a new Ship and a prime Saylor, they made her a Man of War, and put 18 Guns on Board, with 80 Men at Brest since the Fight, and sent her in all haste to Waterford to carry Collonel Porter to K. J. who its said came from Room; but on her return we met with her as aforesaid, she having left three French Men of War, of about 30 and 40 Guns each, in that Harbor, who wait the Motion of the late K. James to carry him off, when put to the rout, which is ex∣pected when our Forces are landed; for the Letters do add that Ireland is but in a very bad condition to hold out against the Force of England, having neither Trade nor Mony; but they have been buoyed up with false News of our not being able to appear at Sea against the French: But I am of opinion the French will not appear fairly to us; we having this Day sent into Brest 12 Sail of Men of War, and 4 Fire-ships, under the Command of Sir Francis Wheeler in the Rupert, with an exquisite French-Protestant Pilot, to do what Execu∣tion they can, and to dare them out. We have taken many Ships of the Nor∣thern, Dutch, Danzeckers, &c. loaded with French Commodities, and Wine and Salt, all to be sent into Plymouth, amongst them one French or Irish Man bound for Ireland from France with Volunteers. July the 15th. This day is held a Coun∣cel of War on board my Lord Torrington Admiral, on Capt. Wilford, for contriving to carry away their Majesties Ship Pendennis to the late K. J. in Ireland; and on some other Officers for Misdemeaners, and as soon as I know, you shall have the Know∣ledg of it.
