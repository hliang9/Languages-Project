I am vndoubtedly assured hereof: first by that inward light of vnderstanding whereby he raiseth testimonie vnto him selfe in the hearts of Rom. 1. 19. men. Secondly by his works of creation, wherein Rom. 1. 20. he hath made his power & godhead visible. Third∣ly by the works of his prouidence, whereby he eui∣dently sustaineth & gouerneth all things.

Ge. 1. 26. 28 A. Most perfect & most happie. But by Satans persuasion man fell from that perfection, & by his Gen. 3. 2. fall both lost his first happinesse, and threw himself and his into extreme miserie. Q. Are we then all miserable? A. All, not one excepted: and that by sinne. Q. What is sinne? A. Sinne is offence against God. Q. Are all men sinners? A. All haue sinned, and haue failed of the glo∣rie Rom. 3. 3. of God. Q.

By our own personall transgressions, in lea∣uing vndone that which is good, and committing that which is euill, in thought, word, & deed: which we may best discerne by the Lawe of God giuen to Rom. 3. 0. that end. Q. How may we affect & pierce our selues here∣with? Act. 2. 37. A. If we consider the greatnesse, lothsomnesse, and multitude of our sinnes, with the punishments due vnto them. Qu. How may this be done? A. The greatnes of our sinnes we may esteeme by the greatnes of him against whom they are cō∣mitted; 1. Sam. 2. 25 and the lothsomnesse, by that most perfect holinesse which is in God, expressed in his Law. Qu. What is the multitude of our sinnes? A. Dauid said, his sinnes were moe then the haires of his head; and who knoweth how often he Psal. 4. 13. Psal. 19. 13 offendeth? Qu. What are the punishments of sinne? A.

Ioh. 2. 2. only in Christ Iesus, who is made vnto vs frō God wsdom, righteousnesse, sanctification & redēption, that who so glorieth might glorie in him. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Q. How is he made our wisedome? A. In that being from before all eternitie the sonne of God, in the fulnesse of time he became Ioh. 1. 13. man, and both out of the bosome of the Father re∣uealed Ioh. 1. 18. vnto vs all things necessarie for vs to know vnto saluation, and is he in whom all the promises of God are yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1. 20. Q. How is he made our righteousnesse? A. In that knowing no sin, he became sinne for vs, that we by him might be made the righteousnes 2. Cor. 5. 21. of God. Qu. Declare this yet more fully. A. He bare the curse of the Law & punishment of our sinnes, to satisfie the iustice of God: and ful∣filled Gal. 3. 13. Esa. 53. 5. Ro. 5. 18. 19 the righteousnesse of the Law, to obtaine for vs the blessing thereof, which is eternall life. Q. How is he made our sanctification? A.

Saluation then being wholly and onely in Christ, how may we attaine thereunto? A. If we beleeue in him. Ioh. 3 16. Qu. What is it to beleeue in Christ? A. Not only to know that saluation is by him a∣lone, but also our selues to put our whole trust and Ioh. 3. 36. confidence in him, and to assure our selues of the forgiuenesse of our sinnes by his death & sacrifice, and of euerlasting life by his obedience. Rom. 5. 18. Qu. Doth this faith only iustifie vs before God? A. Onely. Yet not for the worthinesse of it selfe, but for the worthinesse of him in whom we beleeue Rom. 3. 28. Q. Is this faith in our owne power? A. No. It is the gift of God vnto his children. Ephes. 2. 8. Q. What is the summe of our Christian beleefe? A. That which is expressed in the Creed of the Apostles. I beleeue in God the Father almightie, &c. Q. How doth God giue this gift of faith? A. It is the worke of his spirit in our harts, som∣times Gal. 1. 16. Rom. 10. 14. immediatly by instinct, but ordinarily by the preaching of the word. Q. What is the word of God? A. Generally the holy Scriptures contained in the canonicall bookes of the olde and new Testa∣ment, written by the Prophets & Apostles, but here Ephes. 2. 20. particularly the doctrine of the grace of God vnto saluation by faith in Christ Iesus. 1. Pt. 1. 25. Q. What is the authoritie and vse of the holie
Scriptures in Gods Church? A. They are (saith the Apostle) inspired from God, & profitable to teach, to confute, to reproue, 2. Tim. 3. 16 to instruct, & finally to make the man of God per∣fect vnto euery good worke. Qu. How is it then that some say, the word of God is vnperfect, doubtfull, and obscure? A. These are in deede the blasphemies of An∣tichrist: Psal. 19. 7. Psal. 119. 105. Prou. 8. 9. but God him selfe witnesseth of his word, that it is perfct, plaine, and lightsome. Qu. But you say, the holy Ghost worketh faith by the preaching of the Gospell. A. So it is: for God who commaunded light to shine out of darknes is he that shineth in the harts 2. Cor. 4. 6. of his seruāts, that they might giue fotth the light of the glorie of God, in the face of Iesus Christ. Qu. What is this ministerie of preaching? A. That ordinance of Christ wherby he is pro∣pounded and offered vnto saluation, committed Ioh. 3. 14. 2. Cor. 5. 18. vnto those whom he hath called. Qu. What is the vse and frute of this ministery? A. Being the power and wisdome of God vnto saluation, first the word is thereby made the incor∣ruptible seed of a new birth, to beget vs again vnto 1. Pet. 1. 23 God. Qu. What else? A. It is afterwards that sincere milke whereby as new borne babes we do grow vp vnto the Lord. 1. Tet. 2. 2. Q. Proceede. A. It is finally that strong meate wherby we are fed continually vnto euerlasting life, and that pre∣seruatiue whereby we are kept from euerie blast of 1. Cor. 3 2. Ephes. 4. 14. vaine doctrine. Q. What is that of the keys of the kingdome of Mat. 16. 19
heauen, and the power of binding and loosing? A. It is that authoritie that Christ hath giuen vnto his ministers, exercised publikly both in prea∣ching Mat. 18. 18 the promises and iudgements of God, and in the administration of the censures of the Church. 1. Cor. 5. 5. Q Is there any priuate vse hereof? A. Verie great and necessarie, in comforting of Luc. 7. 48. Act. 8. 20. & 13. 10. afflicted consciences, and in terrifying the obsti∣nate offenders. Q. What other meanes hath God giuen vnto his Church, for confirmation and increase of faith? A. He hath for releefe of our infirmities added vnto the preaching of the word, the administration Act. 2. 38. of his holy Sacraments. Qu. What is a Sacrament? A. A Sacrament is an holy signe and seale or∣dained of God, to continue, confirme, and increase Rom. 4. 11. our faith in Christ. We do also thereby professe & and vow to be his seruants. Q. How is it a signe? A. In that it visibly representeth and expresseth vnto vs that of Christ, and our saluation by him, Luc. 22. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 26 which we are taught by the word preached, and therfore is not vnfitly called, a visible word. Q. How is a Sacrament a seale? A. In that it is annexed of God as a seale vnto his couenant of grace, to assure vs of the truth, and Rom. 4. 11. effect thereof. Q. How manie Sacrameets be there? A. Two. Baptisme and the Supper of the Lord. Mat. 28. Mat. 26. Q. What is Baptisme? A. A Sacrament wherein we are baptized with water into the name of the Father, the Sonne, and 1. Ioh. 1. 7. 1. Pet. 1. 2. the holy Ghost, to teach & assure vs that our sins
are washed away by the blood of Christ, & that we are iustified by his obedience, that we are ingraf∣ted into the bodie of Christ, and adopted to be the children of God. Q. Is there anie other frute of this Sacrament? A. It is also a Sacrament of our mortification vnto sinne by the death of Christ, & of our sanctifi∣cation Rom. 6. 3. 4. Ephes. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 15. 29 by his rising from the dead: also of our own resurrection in the last day, and of our communion with the Saints of God. Qu. Why are infants baptized? A. Because being borne in the couenant and communion of the Church, they are holy vnto the Lord as was Isaac, who was circūcised the eight day 1. Cor. 7. 14 Qu. What is the Supper of the Lord? A. A Sacrament, in bread and wine visibly re∣presenting vnto vs the death & sacrifice of Christ, Mat. 26. 28 1. Cor. 11. 24 and assuring vs of the benefit thereof. Q. What else? A. A pledge of our spirituall communion with Christ the bread of life & food of our soules, wher∣by 1. Cor. 10. 16 Ioh. 6. 51. he dwelleth in vs, and we in him, and are made bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. It is also a pledge of our loue towards all men. Ephes. 5. 30. Q. Who are fit to be admitted vnto this sacra∣ment? A. Such only as can and do examine thēselues 1. or. 11. 28 that they may be worthie receiuers thereof. Q. Wherein standeth this examination? A. We must examine our knowledge and profi∣ting in the principles of religion, our faith in apply∣ing that we know vnto our selues, our repentaunce and purpose of amendement of life, finally our re∣conciliation with others, and loue towards all men euen Mat. 5. 24.
our enemies. V. Qu. Our saluation then being in Christ, not in our selues; & enioyed by faith in him: may we not Rom. 6. 1. now liue as we lust? A. God forbid. Nay who so is in Christ is a new 2. Cor. 5. 17. Ephes. 2. 10. 2. Tim. 2. 19 creature, and who so nameth the name of Christ must depart from iniquitie. Qu. Why so? A. Because that grace of God which bringeth saluation vnto all men, teacheth vs to denie all vn∣godlinesse and worldly lustes, and to liue soberly, Tit. 2. 11. righteously, and godly in this present world. Q. Must we then be a people studious of good workes? Tit. 2. 14. A. Christ therfore died for vs and rose againe, that we who liue by him, should not liue vnto our 2. Cor. 5. 15. Ephes. 2. 10. selues but vnto him: exercising those good workes which he hath appointed vs to walke in. Q. Are not then good workes necessarie vnto saluation? A. They are necessarie in those that are saued, Heb. 12. 14. Ephes. 2. 9. but not necessarie vnto saluation. Qu. How so? A Because we are first saued by faith in Christ, before we can do anie good worke: for whatsoeuer Rom. 14. 23. is not of faith is sinne. Q. May we not satisfie Gods iustice, nor merite saluation by weldoing? A. Our satisfaction and merite is onely in the death and righteousnesse of Christ Iesus: besides Act. 4. 12. which there is none other. As for our workes, as they follow our saluation and go not before it: so Rom. 7. 21. Luc. 17. 10. in this life they are alwayes vnperfect. Also they
are due vnto God, & therefore cannot indebt him vnto vs. Q. Why should we then do good workes? A. For many causes. That God may be glori∣fied Mat. 5. 16. for vs, and of vs; that our liues may be agreea∣ble to our profession, that we may win others vnto the faith, that we may be profitable vnto our bre∣thren 1. Pet. 2. 12 1. Pet. 3. 1. both in example and dutie: and that by the frutes of our faith we may assure our selues of our 2. Pet. 1. 10 calling and election. VI. Q. These are great motiues vnto weldoing: tell me now, what is the rule of good workes? A. Not our own will or intents: nor the exam∣ples, customes or inuentions of men; but the onely Law of God, contained briefly in the two tables of Esa. 8. 20. Exod. 34. the ten commandements. Qu. Why were they written in two tables? A. To distinguish the worship of God, expres∣sed in foure commandements, from our duties to∣ward men, declared in six other commandements. Q. What is the first commandement? A. I the Lord am thy God, &c. Thou shalt haue none other Gods before me. Exod. 20. 2. Q. What is the meaning of this commandemēt? A. That Iehouah the Lord be onely our God: Heb. 11. 6. Psal. 50. 15 that we honor, loue, feare, and obey him, beleeue in him and call vpon him alone. Q. What is the second commandement? A. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenesse of any thing &c. Deut. 4. 12. Qu. What meaneth this commandement? A. That in the outward worship of God, we at∣tempt nothing of our selues, nor admit anie thing Deut. 4. 2.
deuised by others: but exercise our selues in that onely, which God him selfe hath prescribed vnto Deut. 12. 32 vs in his word. Q. What is the third commandement? A. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, &c. Q. What is the meaning of this commādement? A. That we vse the name of God both in oath & otherwise with all high reuerence; also his word & works: that we flie all hypocrisie and colouring in religion: that we abuse not the name of God direct∣ly Iam 5. 12. Mat. 5. 34. or indirectly, in vaine or false swearing, cursing, coniuring, or the like. Q. What is the fourth commandement? A. Remēber thou keep holy the Saboth day, &c. Q. What meaneth this Law? A. That resting euen from our lawfull labours Esa. 58. 13. Act. 2. 42. Act. 20. 7. Heb. 4. 10. Apoc. 14. 13. for this life, we exercise our selues in the labours of euerlasting life: as the word, sacraments, prayer & thanksgiuing, &c. and that we meditate that eter∣nall rest which abideth for vs in the kingdome of heauen. Q. Is not the Iewes Saboth abolished vnto vs? A. Yes: but in place therof succeedeth the chri∣stian 1. Cor. 16. 1. Apoc. 1. 10. Saboth, called the Lords day. Q. Now follow the commandements of the se∣cond table, concerning our duties towardes men: what is the fift commandement? A. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy Ephes. 6. 2. dayes may be long &c. Q What is the sence of this commandement? A. That we loue, honour, obey, and releeue all those whom God hath made superiors vnto vs, ei∣ther Rom. 13. 4. Coloss. 2. 22. in nature or in pollicie: as parents, magistrats,
ministers, maisters, and elders. Who also are Heb. 3. 17. Iosu 24. 15. Gen. 18. 19. bound to performe vnto vs the duties of their cal∣lings. Q. What is the sixt commandement? A. Thou shalt do no murder. Leuit. 19. 18 Q. Tell me the meaning thereof. A. That we offend not against the life or per∣son of our neighbour, and therefore flie all those things that tend vnto bloud That we guard & re∣leeue Gen 9. 5. Ephes. 4. 26. Rom. 12. 19 them with all the meanes and mercie we are able. Q. What meaneth the seuenth commandemēt Thou shalt not commit adulterie. A. That keeping our bodies holy and vndefiled vnto God, by vsing all good meanes making there∣to; 1. Thes. 4. 4. 1. Cor. 6. 15. 19. 20. 1. Cor. 7. 2. 39. we neither assault nor betray the chastitie of o∣thers: and that not hauing the gift of continency, we marrie, onely in the Lord. Q. The eight commandement, Thou shalt not steale, what requireth it? A. That for outward things we remoue not the bounds which God him selfe hath set, neither by violence nor by fraud: but contenting our selues Phl. 4. 11. with our present estate, commend the same vnto God in the diligence of our callings: and that as Ephes. 4. 28 good stewards we faithfully dispense that we haue receiued. 1. Pet. 4. 10 Q. What meaneth the ninth commandement, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour? Deut. 19. 16 A. That neither publikely nor priuatly, we hurt the cause, credit, or name, of our neighbour, espe∣cially Prou. 10. 12 Eccles. 7. Rom. 16. 18 our superiours: but assist and defend them therein: that we lye not, flatter, slander, or the like:
and that we maintaine not others in the same. Q. The tenth commandement, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house, nor his wise, nor &c. Rom. 7. 7. what doth it meane? A. That we keepe euen our hearts and desires Prou. 4. 23. 1. Ioh. 2. 15. Rom. 12. 2. from affecting that which belongeth vnto others: & that we stop vp the verie fountaine of sinne in the corruption of nature; and being renued in the spi∣rit of our minds, dedecate our selues wholly vnto God. VII. Q. Are we able to do all that which is here re∣quired at our hands? A. We are not able of our selues so much as to 2. Cor. 3. 5. Rom. 7. 23. Gal. 5. 17. think a good thought: besides euen in the children of God, the flesh euermore fighteth against the spirit. Q. Whence then is our abilitie? A. It is God that giueth both the will and the Phil. 2. 13. deed, in that being made members of the body of Christ, we receiue from him a measure of know∣ledge, Ephes. 4. 16. desire, & power to do the will of God which graces he daily increaseth in vs by hearing, reading and meditation of his word &c. and by calling vpon his name. Q. May we then come vnto the Lord for all good things, and for power against euill? A. We are commanded so to do, and promised Mat. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 23. 1. Ioh. 5. 14. that we shall obtaine whatsoeuer we shall aske ac∣cording to his wil, and in the name of Christ Iesus. Q. How must we prepare our selues vnto praier? A. We must consider howe great a mercie it is that we haue this accesse vnto God: who he is that Rom. 8. 26. we come vnto: what sense we haue of the want of
that we aske at his hands: our prayers must be ear∣nest and with importunitie, also in faith and assu∣rance Iam. 1. 6. of Gods goodnes. And finally we must pray not onely for our selues, but also for all men, euen our enemies. Q. What forme and maner is here to be obser∣ued? A. Our present occasions, & the feeling of our necessities will best direct vs herein. But we may conclude and shut vp our prayers with that forme Mat. 6. 9. Luc. 11. 2. which our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs. Q. Rehease the same. A. Our Father which art in heauen hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdome come: Thy will be done in earth as it is in heauē. Giue vs this day our daily bread: And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs: And leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euil. For thine is the kingdome, the power & the glorie, for euer and euer. Amen. VIII. Q. What meaneth S. Paule when he saith vnto Timothie, Exercise thy selfe vnto godlinesse? 1. Tim. 4. 7. A. That as the arts of this world taught by pre∣cepts, are holpen by practise: so after the graces be∣fore mentioned, there is no small helpe vnto god∣linesse in such exercises as are commended vnto vs either by precept or example, in the word of God. Heb. 5. 14. Q. What are those exercises? A. Sorow for sinne past, feare and care against temptation: labor after that which is good: accu∣sing Psal. 51. 14 Prou. 14. 16 Eccles. 1. 2. Tit. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 9. 27. and rebuking of our selues: mourning ouer the vanitie of this life: an holy and sober vse of Gods blessings: fasting, and other chastisements of the
flesh: couenanting with our selues to leaue euill, & Psal. 119. 106. do good: imitation of the godly, and conference with others, both helping them, and receiuing help of them. Q. Are there anie other besides these? A. We shall not a litle stirre vp our selues, if we seriously consider the works of God in creating the world: his power, prouidence and wisedome in go∣uerning Psal. 19. 1. the same: his iudgements vpon the wic∣ked, & his mercies towards those that obey him. Psal. 73. 1. Q. Proceed vnto the rest. A. Satietie and wearinesse of this sinfull life, with desire to be with Christ. Meditation of death, buriall, resurrection, and the iudgement to come: Philip. 1▪ 23 the miserie of the damned, the felicitie of the elect, and the eternitie of both. Q. Remaine there yet anie more? A. The particular consideration of Gods bene∣fits towards our selues, renued vpon vs euery mor∣ning, and of our deliuerance from manie euils and Lam. 3. 23 dangers we might haue fallen into: a wise estima∣tion Heb. 12. 7. 10. 1. Cor. 11. 3 1. Pet. 1. 7. of those afflictions of bodie, & griefs of mind, losses, perils, &c. wherewith the Lord doth either chastise our sinnes, or trie our faith. Q. These for the most parte are done by our selues: may we not also be holpen by the dutie of others towards vs? A. Yes, and that greatly, through the blessing of God; as by his ministers, magistrates, and all that Rom. 13. 4 haue power or authoritie ouer vs; when they in∣struct, exhort, admonish, rebuke or cēsure vs: which they are commanded to do, & we to accept at their hands for our good. Q. What is the summe of all that hath bin said?
A. That there is one onely true God in three persons. That all men are sinners, and the reward of sinne euerlasting damnation. That our onely re∣medie is Christ Iesus, apprehended by faith alone. That faith is the gift of God wrought in vs by the Gospell preached, and confirmed by the vse of the Sacraments. That they that liue by Christ, must liue not vnto them selues but vnto him: that the rule of good workes is the onely law of God, vnto the obedience whereof we are enabled by grace, & the giftes of the spirit, and holpen forwardes dayly by the holy and Christian exer∣cises of our faith. FINIS.
