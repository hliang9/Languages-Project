Richard Hodgkinson, John Braford, Timothy Grady, Edward Grady Randol Russel, William Harris, Joseph Phillips, Evan Wood, William West, William Woodward, William Carter, John Anderson, Frances Lewis, Dorothy Clark, Dorothy Hall, with a particular account of each persons Fact for which they suffered. ALthough many and most frequent are the sad Examples of these much to be deplored and miserable Offendors, yet 'tis plainly seen that warnings are in vain, and no ways of sufficient force for to deter them from pursuing of their own Destructions, as we shall in these Catastrophies as follow, demonstrate to the World. The first Example of offended Justice was upon one Robert Lewis, who was Arraigned for entring the House of one Susan∣na, White, in the Ward of Billingsgate, and Felloniously bearing thence one silver Tankard vallued at four pounds, with several spoons, Porringers, and several Goods and Chattels to a consi∣derable vallue, but being pursued, he dropt them before he could be taken, notwithstanding the Evidence being plain he was Con∣victed of the Fellony, and having been an old Offendor, and once before burn'd in the hand, the Sentance of Death passed upon him, after which being mindful of the miserable State wherein he was, he much lamented his untimely and most shame∣ful End, desiring Mercy for his many Transgressions and Offences and forgiveness of whomsoever he had offended, being not only penitent in Newgate, but continued so.
The next in this dread Scene of Woe, was Evans Wood, who was Arraigned for Fel∣lony and Burglary, for that he broke open a Booksellers shop in Holbourn, and taking thence several Books to the vallue of forty shillings or thereabouts, of which there being publick notice given, by exhibiting of Printed Bills, and he offering to expose them to sail was apprehended. The Evidence affirmed, that he saw the Prisoner with a Window-cafe upon his Shoulders, that night the Burglary was committed, whereupon he was found guilty; and having been burnt in the hand bofore for Rob∣bing Esquire Hooker of about 1500 pounds, he received Sentance, after which, as sensible of his most wretched State, bewailing his stupidity, and much lamenting that no warning was sufficient to restrain him from pursuing those dismal paths, that tend∣ed both to mortal and immortal Death, unless the blessed Mercy of a Mediator inter∣posed. Randal Russel a notorious Picklock, and House-breaker, who having formerly been burnt in the hand for a Fellony, and being taken again upon suspicion for breaking open Esquire Trouts Chamber in New-Imu, was double fetter'd, and put into the Ma∣sters Chamber in Newgate, from whence he in the company of six more notorious of∣fendors, escaped, by first filing off their Fetters, and then with Plough-coulters and other impliments, forcing the Stones and Iron Bars in the Wall, on the 22th of Febru∣ary last, and the said Russel being retaken, was found Guilty of the Fellony, and re∣ceived Sentance accordingly, and though he had been an old Offendor, (and there being taken about him when he was apprehended, no less than thirty false Keys and Pick∣locks (yet Death the Gastly King of Terrors, so amazed his long exalted Spirit, that sunk like Lead, and he bewailed his presumptuous folly, that had brought a Ruine on his head, and caused him for to die an ignominious Death. The next in order, were Joseph Phillips, William Harris, John Anderson, who were Arraigned for Robing Justice Northies Coach near Bow, and taking from his wife and Son, goods, and monies to the vallue of one hundred and odd pounds, a Scarf, the Gentlemans Cravat, several Rings, a Handkerchief, and about four or five shillings, in monies, the evidenee swore them to be the same Men, and thereupon they were cast and Condemned, after whose Condemnations they were much dejected and in vain beging Mercy from the Court, desiring Transportation, the which could not be grant∣ed, so that during their resPite in Newgate, all of them as it behoved dying Men, much lamented, though too late as to this World their unlawful Designs and Actions one of them being by Birth a Sweed. Dorothy Clark, was also Arraigned for stealing a Campaign Coat from one Mr. Beacon in Eastcheaep, vallued at thirty five shillings; when she came into the Shop she pretend∣ing to buy a Coat, conveyed away this for which she was Indicted, whereupon being found Guilty and having been a notorious Shoplift, formerly burnt in the Hand, and several times in Newgate, she was thought incorrigable, and therefore received the fame Sen∣tance as the former, powring forth her Tears, at such a lavish Rate as gained Commi∣seration from all the Spectators, deploring much her hard Fate, that had pushed her forward to her own Destruction. In Newgate she was very attentive to such Godly Ministers, and others who came to visit her, &c. The next in this dismal Tragedy were Timothy Grady and Edward Grady two Foot∣pads; who were arraigned for Fellony and Robbery, for setting upon, and Robbing one Mr. Holder and his Wife between Hays and Siuth-town. in Ʋxbridg-Road, between nine and ten of the clock in the Evening of what monies he had about him, being about forty shillings, as likewise rifflng his wife of her Ring and several other things, dis∣arming Mr. Holder, and after the taking away his Campaign Coat departed, vowing if he offered to follow or pursue them they would Murther him, but this being on the Saturday, on the Monday following several Warrants being ishued out for the appre∣hending of them, they were took in St. Gileses in the Feilds, Timothy Grady having the self-same Coat on his back he had taken from the Gentleman, upon their Trials they stoutly denied it, but seeing the proof was plain, and positive, Timothy Grady con∣fessed that he was in the Robbery, but in vain endeavoured to excuse the other, so that they both being found Guilty, received the Sentance of Death, after which being con∣veyed to Newgate they spent their time in preparation for their Eternity, giving great attention unto Godly Exhortations, and so continued to the Admiration of many that came to visit them, during the respit allowed for preparation. John Braford was Arraigned, found Guilty, and Condemned, for a notorious Burgla∣ry breaking open a Widdow womans House near Tatnam Cout and binding all her Fa∣mily; ransacked the House, taking thence Goods to the Vallue of nine or ten pounds, and afterwards being taken by Captain Richardsons Men was challenged in Newgate,
this being Proved against him he received Sentance of Death, having been a notori∣ous Offender, yet as it is commonly seen, when he see no hope for Life, he was very Penitent, bewailing his misdeeds, &c. Wllliam Carter was Arraigned, and upon full proof convicted of Fellony and Burglary, for breaking open the house of one How, of EIsham in Kent, and taking thence, two Flitches of Bacon, Hoods, Scarfs, Stockings, and other Clothes, to a considerable vallue; he and his Accomplices binding the Man of the House, and the rest of the Family and so departed with their Booty, but going to take water at Re∣deriff, they were suspected by some Watermen, and no sooner had they crossed the water, but they perceiving themselves pursued, divided and fled, so that only Carter was taken, who had one pair of the Stockings on, and a stick in his hand, which he had taken out of the Chamber, with several other things, of which Fellony and Burglary being Convicted, he received Sentance of Death. His Repentance was not so becoming, as to sute with a Man in his much to be deplored Condition, yet when the time of his suffering drew near, he shewed much Contrition for his former evil Courses. Sarah Good was found Guilty of two Indictments, one for stealing a Silver Tan∣kard, one silver Bole and a silver standing Cup, from Samuel Dod a Vintner, without Bishopsgate, the other for stealing one silver Tankard, and one Dram-Cup, from Ro∣ger Saunders, in St. Botelphs Bishapsgate, the Fellonies being proved she received Sen∣tance to dye according to the Law, the which was this day put in Execution, before which she much bewailed her so untimely end, advising the Spectators to beware how they yielded to the temptations of the Enemy of Humane kind, lest he brought rhem to Destruction. Dorothy Hall was found Guilty of two Fellonies and Burglaries committed by her and one Ann Green, upon the House of one Mr-Sanders, and one Mr. Man, near Brainford, for stealing thence Linnen, Puter-Flaggons, Cocks and Hens, to a consi∣derable vallue, for which she received Sentance to dye, and her Partner by reason of her simplicity, was allowed the favour of a transportation, she had been an old Offendor, and therefore was not mvch concerned at the approach of her untimely Fate. Frances Lewis an old Offendor, who had long practised the Trade of Tankard-steal∣ing, and had been very svccessful in her unlawful Enterprizes, but as the common Proverb notes- (the Pitcher goes not so oft to the Well, but it comes broaken home at last) so she at length was taken in the very Fact, for coming into a certain Victual∣ling House near Crooked Lane, she calling for a Tankard of Drink, pretended to stay for some Gentlemen that would immediately be there, but seeing the People busie, and neglectful of their Charge, she fairly bid her Host Goodbuy not so much as asking what she had to pay, but drinking some, and pouring out the rest, she carried off the empty Tankard vallued at five pounds to serve her proper Use, but being pursued and taken, was Committen, and it being on her Trial proved that she was notorious for Offences in that kind, she was Convicted and received Sentance, after which she much bewails her dismal Fate that had hurried her on to an untimely and an unavoided Death bedned with Tears, and serious remorse, she continued all the intervening time allowed her to make Peace with Heaven for the blessed welfare of her own im∣mortal Soul. Elizabeth Plummer a notorious Shoplift, whose many Crimes has spread her Name throughout this great Metropolis, she was Aaraigned and found Guilty for felloni∣ously taking and bearing away 28 yards of Flowered Silk from one Edward Rigby a Mercer, near the Exchange, and delivering it to one of her Consorts, who sould it to one Mrs. Edwards the Fellony being plainly proved, she was found Guilty, nor could she her self deny the same, so that being formerly pardoned yet would not take no warning, she received the Judgment of the Court, after which the near approach of Death, startled her amazed Conscience, and she seriously repented her of her many great and grievous Crimes, and so continued till the fatal moment of Mortality expired and pusht her off into a vast Eternity. Richard Hodgkons a Highway Man, and most notorious padder, was severally indict∣ed for two Robberies by him committed, the one was near Bow, the other near Hamp∣sted, upon two Gentlemen, taking from one of them forty shillings, or thereabouts, and from the other 14 shillings more or less, with several other their Goods and Chat∣tels, to both which Indictments he pleaded Guilty, and for them was Condemned to dye, seeming but very little concerned at the near approach of his most great and dreadful Change, but certain Death that bears an awe upon the Spirits of the most re∣solute
of Men, soon made his haughty Courage fail, and at the last put him so far in mind of immortality, as to draw Tears from his no doubt but Penitential) Eyes. The Sunday before the Fxetution there was an excellent Sermon preached in the Chappel of Newgate, not only to the Condemned, but to a numerous Audito∣ry that resorted thither from several parts of this City. The Text of Scrip∣ture, chosen for that purpose being the 14th Chapter of the Proverbs and the 27th Verse, to which the Reverend Divine most effectually applied, that the fear of God was the only way to restrain all daring Sinners from their vi∣cious enterprises, and that the Fear of God is the means and ground to raise sal∣vation on, and that God is pleased with those that tremble at his Word, a God slow to Anger, of great Mercy, and willing to pardon all that with sincere Re∣pentance come unto him and lay hold on him by Faith. And that none ought to dispair of saving Health, that cast themselves upon him, concluding with many sacred and prevailing Exhortations, at which they all seemed much to lament their most woful State that they (must perhaps) unprovided, plunge into a vast Eternity: desiring all that came to be Spectators of their Trajick Ends and Fi∣nal Dissolution as to this mortal State, to beware, lest they gave way to vile Temptations, which like a Poisoned Arrow fix a fatal Ruine in the Soul, and drive secure Offendors on till they unmindful of their ways are taken in the Snares that justice lays for those that dare offend the Laws of Men, and so in∣vite untimely Fate to ruine them past all recovery, and so they continued lifting up their hands to Heaven, and pouring forth their penitential Years, to expi∣ate and wash away those Crimes which long Custome and repeated Crimes had so inured them to. William West was Arraigned for that he in the Parish of Stepney did Felloniously take and bear away thirteen Yards of Chamblet from one Robert Adkins, and he being an old Offendor and once burned in the hand before, was found Guilty of the Fellony, and after the dreadful Sentance had past upon him he became very Penitent, and so continued all the time that he was in Newgate. A little before the time of Execution, Robert Lewis, Sarah Good Elizabeth Plummer received his Majesties most gracious Reprieve. FINIS.
