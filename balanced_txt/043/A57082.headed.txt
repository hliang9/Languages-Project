The Resolutions of the Army, against the King, Kingdome and City. Iuly 15. 1648. at 8 of the Clocke in the Morning. MEMORANDVM, That upon the day above set, Iohn Dias one of Colonell Whaleys Regiment, and Kinsman, did utter these speeches following: That the resolution of the Army was to fight for themselves, a∣gainst all that should oppose them; and that they resolved not to bee governed by a King, and that nothing vexed them more, then the Parliaments recalling their Declarations of making no more addres∣ses to the King. And being asked why they did not declare; he answered, That yet it was no time, but that shortly, hee did not doubt, but that all would be their owne, and then they would make their reso∣lutions knowne. It was replied, that if the Army should thus declare, it was likely the City and Kingdome would rise. He answered, They regarded not the City, but could fire it at pleasure. It was likewise inquired, How the Generall had performed his word with the King and Kingdome, in re-establishing the King, and restoring the Kingdome to peace. He answered, The Generall never intended any such thing; and that for the personall Treaty the Army would not suffer it, because the City would thinke they gained the honour of it; and that the Parliament did Vote the personall Treaty only to delude the people, and to keep them in suspence while they had done their businesse abroad. Hee likewise sayd, Hee should (or hoped) to see the City on fire shortly. He further sayd, That if the Kings Revenew were tenne times so much more, it were the better for them; for the Crowne Land would make many of the soldiers Gentlemen: and if we con∣quer you, then you shalbe our slaves; and if you conquer us, wee wilbe your slaves; and further he sayd, that this was not onely his sence, but likewise the sence of the whole Army.
