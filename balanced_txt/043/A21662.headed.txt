❧ By the Queene. THe Queenes Maiestie being sundry wayes enfourmed, that many marchaunts, aswell of her owne subiects as straungers, seeking their owne singuler game and aduauntage, contra∣ry to all reason and the common wealth of her Maiesties good and naturall subiects, and directly against thauncient lawes and Sta∣tutes of this Realme, haue of late gathered into their hands great quantities of Hoppes, making such a monopoly of the same Hoppes. as the hundreth weight of Hops which hath ben vsually solde within these fewe yeeres at xiii. s. iiii. d. or xx. s. at the most for euery hundreth, be now solde for syxe poundes and more. The ill example whereof, myght bryng the lyke monopolies of other wares and marchaundizes, to the great losse of the multitude of marchaunts vsyng the trade of marchaundize, and to the great decay of the common wealth of this her Maiesties Realme: Doth therefore straightly charge and commaunde, that from and af∣ter the first day of February next, no Marchaunt be he her Maiesties naturall subiect, or straunger, shall put to sale any Hoppes, directly or vndirectly, in grosse or by retayle, at any greater or more pryce then forty shillings for euery hundreth at the most, vpon payne of incurring such pe∣nalties, as ben prouided by her Maiesties lawes, and vpon her Maiesties hygh displeasure and imprisonment. Straightly chargyng and com∣maunding all manner her Maiesties officers and ministers, to whom it shall appertaine, to fee that the premisses be effectually put in execution, and the offenders therein duely punished. Yeuen at her Maiesties Castle of Wyndsor, the xxx. of Ianuary, the syxt yeere of her highnes raigne. God saue the Queene. Imprinted by Richard Iugge and Iohn Cawood Printers to the Queenes Maiesty.
