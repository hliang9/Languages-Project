A SERMON Preached at Glascow in SCOTLAND, By Mr. JAMES KEA, TO The Rebels in Arms. The TEXT, Sion is wounded. BEluved in our Loard, before I gang any furder, gee me leave, by the geate, to show yee twa things, and then I's open my Text and hanle my pearts as they ligg in order. 1st. Beluved, wha is meant by Sion i'my Text, that's ean the pure Kirk a Scotland, the hally Profet talls ye with a hoy hart, that Sion is wonded; but gen he had leved e these weafow dayes a ours, he e plain termes wad a tall'd ye that te pure Kirk a Scotland is wonded. 2ly. Wha has wonded her tro ye? To this purpose I's tell ye a tale, but I's nay say 'tis true; but be it true, or be it fauce, takt as I tink it a Gods beneson: When I was a young Laddy, thur was a warsom man a Student a Theologie in the Colledge of Aberdeen, an he was te make a Preechment before te Masters a this Colledge; an out au te hally Scripture o God he weiled this Text: an he tall'd 'um, What will ye give me, an Is't betray her to ye? (and he cud hasel it in Latine, Quid dabitis?) And tere was a honest auld man sitinge at te fuet of te Powpit, and he ses tull him, Sir, gin yele betray him te me, Is't give ye a geud fat Bishop∣rick. Now ye may here by this wha it is that betrays Crist, an wonds te pure Kirk a Scotland. But now te come te my Text, Sion is wonded, te pure Kirk of Scotland is wonded; wher is she
wonded tro ye? I trow an she were wele lanced, ther wad ne prove a sond bit in hur; but for mere satisfaction, she is won∣ded e fore places. 1st. She is wonded e hur head, e respect a hur Rulars. 2ly. E hur hands, e respect a hur Decipline. 3ly. E hur hart, e respect a hur Doctrin. An 4ly. E hur feet, e respect of hur Worship. Now we Gads good leave ya ward or twa to eke a them, in a ward a applycation, and se Is't come te a close. 1st. Beluved, te pure Kirk a Scotland is wonded e hur hed, e respect a hur Rulars. Is't teel ye, Beluved, te pure Kirk a Scotland has got sick a clack o hur head as has gerd hur breins to jumpe agean: and who is it, tro you? I mean by hur Rulars, ene those that misrule hur; that's ene te proud Bi∣shops. And te Bishops they ha wonded hur we three Sweards: 1st. We te sweard o ther Pride. I ha seen te day, and sea has sum o yea, whan a gued Minister wad a gen tripen up an down te geate fow wansamly, we a Cap o his head an a short Cleake we a side-neck, an a Gads name he wad a made a fow wansom Preechment wad a den a hart gued to a heard him: But te Bishops thur proud fow swingers, tha mun ha thur silk Girdles hang dribbling about thur Arses, an as mickle about thur tales as wad mak six peer a Briches tel a peer man. 2ly. she has wonded te pure Kirk a Scotland we the sweard a hur Gluttony. I ha heard te day that a gued Minister wad ha been weel content we a dish fow a Milk an Bread, or ought that te hally gued Gad wad a sent; but te Bish. thur bellygad lownes, I'st fear tha'l no gang te the Deele we lean branes: they eat and drink an feed o te fat o te Land, but gen a peer man cum to thur deare death-like, een to famish for caud an hanger, tha'l naw ge him se micle as wad fill his maw. 3ly. Tha ha wonded te peer Kirk a Scotland we the sweard of thur Co∣vetusness. Beluved, tha mun ha sea mickle ilken Bural, sea mickle Bridal, and sea mickle for ilken Wile an Testament, an Gad kens what meer beside; weel I'st say in a wurd ge um ene te Deel for he's mickle, an tha ar ene greedy that neer be satisfied. Tha ha sea robbed, an sea hirried, and sea pillaged an plundered te peer Kirk a Scotland, that gan Gad will ne scarge um out o'th Land, as he did ye ance before, tha'l ne leave hur so mickle as yaw nale to claw hur sell withaw.
2ly. Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wounded e hur hans, e re∣spect o hur Discipline. I'st teel ye, Beluved, te peer Kirk a Scotland is so wounded e hur hands, that this long while sine te King o Angland cam in, she cud nere make a hammock o a cauld day: we ha sike straung an uncouth Laws among us, weel anger us aul te heart before we geet rid o um: tha teel us we mun ne preech we out ore white sackes o or backs, an that we mun ha a neest a whisles set up e or Kirks; that we mun ha ore Barnes baptezed we a sine o te Cross, or rader we te sine o te hore; wele let te homigers de what te will, Ist fear Christ an his hally Desciples neer learnt any sike thing. 3ly. Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wonded e hur Hart e respect o hur Doctrin. Te Kirk a Scotland is se rotten o hur Hart, an that same infection has se spread it sell thro aw hur body, that te sea the truth o hur, she is nother sond winde nor lim, an ne portion will cure hur but te hally, hally Solemne League and Cuvenant renued, which we Gads good blessing wad restore hur to hur wonted health. Agen, 4ly. Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wonded e hur feet e respect o hur Worship. I can remember, Beluved, sine te Kirk o Scotland meght a-been liknet te a bony nagg, that cud amelet an peace it fow sweet∣ly; but te Bishops thur galloping swingers tha gat o ye back o that nag, an tha quite jaded hime up te ruin; for they lade upon hur back te buek o Comon Prayer, an te buek o Cannons; an sine tha came to London, they lade upon hur back te Yeath o Supremacy an te Kirk Law-bueks; an than they came trippen down te Edenburgh te unlate thur baggage, I wornt what ar∣rant tha had there; but Beluved, what here an what there, tha ha sea used him, that they ha no left yeaw fast naile e his fuet: an now Beluved, we may tell ore teale without lauter, we can liken hime now to neane but Balams Ass, e which story thur be three things te be heeded. 1. Te Ass, that's ene te peer Kirk o Scotland. 2ly. Te riders, an that's ene te proud Bishops. 3ly. Te gued Angell that stopt te Ass by te geate, an who tro ye is that? I wot weel ye wad fain hear that; why 'tis ene my good Lard H. Gads benison on his bony face, ther he sits, the trimest light that ere te peer Kirk o Scotland ever saw. And now we hope te gued Angell will kick te
lownes out o the saddle, for he hangs by te hough, hauf out an haufe in; an fain wad he keep in still; an talls ye, let him but stay in an he'l nere trouble ye we te pork∣mantle any meer; but the Deele is a wilye paw, let him but get in his little finger, an he'l seen get in his heele hand; let but te Lownes get his arse into the saddle ageane, an ye may aw paw tell ye are weary before ye can get him out agen. But now ya ward or twa o uses: an 1. ya word o incorragment te all te gued people o Gad, that ha set thur heart an hans te re∣nuing te auld an antient Solemn League an Cuvenant: weel, Ist say ne meer but this, as ye ha began this gued warke, ene see it perfit, and ye shall no loose yere reward e heaven, 2ly. I ha ya word o reproofe to ye Provest and Bayliffe of this gued Town, ye weel ne subscribe te year, but bide te next year an then ye weel; but I see ye are aw alive te year, but Gad kens who will be alife neext. I ha ya ward meer o reproofe to ye Collecters o ye Kings rents, ye will no subscribe nowther, till next year yer Offices be out, for fear o the Kings displeasure. Beluved, I mun conclude we ya ward, an that is this, ene this; There is but ya sort o folke between Gad an ye: tak away that sort o men, an ye may aw gang to heven, sheeke by shole, yan by another. FINIS.
