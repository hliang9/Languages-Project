A TRUE NARRATIVE OF THE BLOODY MƲRTHER OF THE Earl of Essex, UPON Himself, being now Prisoner in the Tower. ON Friday morning about Seven of the Clock, being the thirteenth of this instant July; His Majesty and Royal Highness came down from Whitehall in their Barges to the Tower, to take a view of the Store houses, and was walking there some considerable time about the lines, and coming by the Earl of Essex his chamber, the Earl was struck with such remorse of Conscience, to think what a loyal man his Father was, and how he gave his life a Sacrifice for the late King, of blessed memory, and considering how lately he had free access to his Majesty; but now being under confinement, and the terror of a guilty Conscience, desperately cut his own Throat with his Razor and deprived himself of Life immediately, and from thence was carried to the Captain of the Warders lodgings to be disposed of as his Majesty shall think most fit. I hope this will be a warning to all to take care how they involve themselves in such horrid designs least their portion prove fatal like his, but now let the world know, that such cruel Bloody designs, especially against a Prince most Merci∣ful and Gracious, can never go unpunished, but will undoubtedly meet with a recompence answerable to the deserts of such horrid Cruelties. London, Printed for J. Scott. 1683.
