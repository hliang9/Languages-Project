THE PARLIAMENT'S ANSWER, TO HIS MAJESTIES GRACIOUS LETTER Of the fourth of July, 1663. Most Sacred Soveraign, THE desire we have had to re∣turn to Your Majesty a satis∣factory account of what, by Your most gracious Letter the fourth of June, was intru∣sted to us, for trying of the contrivance and carrying on that design of Billeting, (with which Your Majesty with so much reason declared Your self most unsatisfied) hath occasioned, that we have not sooner made these humble and thank∣full acknowledgments, which the gracious expres∣sions in the former part of Your Letter call for; Being desirous, that the account of our duti∣ful and hearty obedience to these Your Maje∣sties most just Commands, might accompany
our due acknowledgments of Your Majesties Grace and Goodness, and that our return might not divide, what Your Majesty hath by Your Royal Letter joyned. We do, with all humble duty and thank∣fulness, acknowledge the great blessings which this Your ancient Kingdom doth now enjoy under Your Royal Authority, The Church being restored to it's right Govern∣ment, the Kingdom to its former Peace, the Laws to their free Course, and the Subjects to their just Liberties; And all these flowing to us as the happy fruits and effects of Your Majesties blessed Restitution, we conceive our selves obliged in a due resentment thereof, and of the often and renewed expressions of Your Majesties Royal care and tenderness of this Kingdom, to return the humble offer of our lives and fortunes, and all that is dearest to us, for the advancement of Your Majesties Ho∣nour, Authority and Greatness: And that it shall be our care, that the expressions of our obedience to Your Majesties Commands, shall be suitable to those unparallel'd Acts of Grace and Favour Your Majesty hath vouchsafed up∣on us. By Your Majesties Letter it appears, That by a Gentleman imployed last year with a Let∣ter of Credit from the Earl of Middleton, it was represented to Your Majesty, that it was the desire of Your Parliament here, that the Act of Indempnity should carry an exception of incapacitating from publick Trust: and that he earnestly prest, in name of Your Parliament, Your Majesties consent to the
incapacitating some few of the most guilty, not exceeding twelve. And your Majesty desiring to know the truth thereof from us; In obe∣dience to your Majesties Commands, this being taken into the consideration of Your Parlia∣ment, and every Member of Parliament par∣ticularly asked thereupon, we finde by the una∣nimous opinions and votes of the House, That the Parliament gave no warrand, to desire of Your Majesty, that the Act of Indempnity should carry an exception of incapacitating from publick Trust, and that the Parliament gave no warrand at all, to desire in their names, Your Majesties consent to the incapacitating of a few; Yet we have seen the inclosed double of an Instruction, given by the Earl of Middleton in the contrary, to Sir George Mackenzie, signed and owned by him in presence of your Parlia∣ment to be a just double, bearing, that it was much desired by Your Parliament, that some should be excepted from publick Trust. We also finde no other ground in the Act of Parliament concerning Billetting, neither do we remember of any other ground made use of before the Articles, or in the Parliament, for incapacitating, but that it was Your Ma∣jesties pleasure to have it so, and that this was the rise of bringing in the Act of Billetting, as the most expedient way of voting the Act for Incapacitie. And in obedience to Your Majesties Com∣mands for the further tryall of the manner of contrivance and carrying on this design of Bil∣letting, and Your Majesties suspicion that Your Name was abused therein; some Com∣missioners
authorized by Your Parliament, ha∣ving taken the depositions of divers Mem∣bers of Parliament, and two Knights, there∣upon, and having delivered the principal depo∣sitions to Your Majesties Commissioner, to be by his Grace communicated to Your Majesty, Have offered to us this particular account thereof under their hand-writings, which we (without presuming at all to give any judgment thereupon) offer hereby to Your Majesties Royal consideration; And when Your Majesty shall be pleased to make Your further pleasure there∣in known to us, we shall give such obedience thereto, and to the other particulars in Your Royal Letter, as shall witness to the world, that Your Majesties Royal Judgment is the rule of our actions, and that your Majesties Commands shall alwayes receive that obedience from us, which suits with the duty of good Subjects, and the relation we now serve Your Majesty in, as Your Majesties most loyal and faithful Parliament; In whose Name, and by whose Command, these are signed by, Your Majesties most humble, most dutiful, and most obedient Subject and Servant, Glencairn Cancellarius, J. P. D. Par. Edinburgh 28 July, 1663. EDINBƲRGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the King's most Excellent Majesty, 1663.
