To the right Honourable and most Vertuous Lady, the Lady Anne, Coun∣tesse of Warwicke. I Am accused of presumption (right ex∣cellent Lady) by this noble Common∣wealth which I heere present vnto you, who gloriously shining in the cleere knowledge of her owne incomparable worthinesse, doth like a beautifull vir∣gine, that seeing her faire picture foule∣ly handled of an vnskilfull painter, blush at the view of her wronged beauty, and reproueth me for hauing with such feeble forces so farre presumed in the description of her rich and roy∣all history; a matter which the rarest forraine spirites of our time haue by their learned pens so highly enobled with such ex∣cellent art & ornaments: she wel knoweth the cleernes of your iudgement, and therfore feareth bearing the burthen and ble∣mishes of so great a weakenesse to approch the rayes of a censure so vndeceiueable and absolute. I haue no shield nor excuse to oppose against this iust impu∣tation, but onely the defence of your Ladishippes fauours, who though by former experience knowing my vnfitnesse for such a worke, did neuerthelesse impose this taske vpon me. Now therefore my humble request is, that howsoeuer the vntuned harshnesse of my disioynted stile shall seeme vnplea∣sant in your eares, yet that you will vouchsafe to be a gentle &
propitious defendresse to this renowned Commonwealth, that nothing more desireth then to bee gracious in your sight, and here frankely offreth vnto your view the naked full discouerie of her faire and be utifull lineaments, not concealing any part of her rarest perfections. Onely she humbly desireth, that si∣thence it is her happe to bee brought into Englande, she may haue free and quiet passage vnder your honourable safe conduct and protection: for such is the generall loue and reuerence, which the great worthinesse and integritie of your vnblemi∣shed life, and your long constant continued course in the exer∣cise of a spotlesse vertue hath vniuersally gained you, that bea∣ring with her the faire warrant of your so many waies enobled name, she shall not need to feare any vnciuill or disgracious v∣sage, no not of those, whose minds are diseased with the grea∣test enuie. Finally, I beseech you (good Madame) not to measure my duetie towardes you by this meanes, wherein I seeke to shew it: for this I know to bee ordinary and vulgar, and so farre from the satisfaction of mine owne mind, as that I am in a manner therewith displeased, but the other, if euer your commande∣ment, opportunity of time and occasion, or the vttermost strain of my inuention and indeauour giue me leaue, shall discouer it selfe in a better proportion: for I will neuer forget, but still re∣taine engraued in the marble table of a thankefull memory (be∣sides the dutie our family oweth vnto that noble house wherein you matched) the many fauours you haue done me in particu∣lar, and he many wayes you haue sought to doe me good, where∣in though the violence of my own fortune hath stil encountred your enaeuor, yet ther remaineth vnto me no small comfort, & withal I doe somewhat the better esteeme my selfe, in that your Ladishippe, whose iudgement, wisedome, and vertue passeth
with such generall allowance; hath deemed me worthy of your honourable good opinion, and thereof hath made me assured by many most essentiall testimonies. In conclusion Madam, I will neuer cease to honour you, and in the meane time humbly beseech you to accept in good part, these the fruites of my ex∣tream idlenes, the poore pledges of that duty, which I would discharge towardes you in greater matters, if I were able, and for my part I will neuer cease to pray vnto the almighty to blesse you with honour and happines, such as so great worthinesse, and vertue deserueth. Selsey this thirteenth of August. 1598. Your Ladyshippes most faithfully to commaund LEWES LEWKENOR.
THe antique Babel, Empresse of the East, Vpreard her buildinges to the threatned skie: And Second Babell tyrant of the West, Her ayry Towers vpraised much more high. But with the weight of their own surquedry, They both are fallen, that all the earth did feare, And buried now in their own ashes ly, Yet shewing by their heapes how great they were. But in their place doth now a third appeare, Fayre Venice, flower of the last worlds delight, And next to them in beauty draweth neare, But farre exceedes in policie of right. Yet not so fayre her buildinges to behold As Lewkenors stile that hath her beautie told. Edw. Spencer. FAyer mayden towne that in rich Thetis armes, Hast still been fostered since thy first foundatiō. Whose glorious beauty cals vnnumbred swarmes Of rarest spirits from each forrein natiō, And yet (sole wonder to all Europes eares, Most louely Nimph, that euer Neptune got) In all this space of thirteene hundred yeares, Thy virgins state ambition nere could blot. Now I prognosticate thy ruinous case, When thou shalt from thy Adriatique seas, View in this Ocean Isle thy painted face, In these pure colours coyest eyes to please, Then gazing in thy shadowes peereles eye, Enamour'd like Narcissus thou shalt dye. I. Ashley
VEnice inuincible, the Adriatique wonder, Admirde of all the world for power and glorie, Whom no ambitious force could yet bring vn∣der, Is here presented in her States rare storye, Where all corrupt means to aspire are curbd, And Officers for vertues worth elected. The contrarie wherof hath much disturbd All states, where the like cause is vnrespected, A document that Iustice fortifies Each gouernment (although in some thinges faultie) And makes it dreadfull to the enuying eyes Of ill affecting foes, and tyrants haulty. Lewkenor, whom armes and letters haue made knowen, In this worke hath the fruits of either shewen. Maur. Kiffen. TI's not affected grace, or mockt disguise Assures a true returne from forren partes. Trauell confounds the vaine, confirmes the wise, Leukenor liue thou esteemde for thy deserts, While thy last trauels do thy first commend, To straungers prou'd in them a gratefull frende, And for thy absence to thy natiue clyme, A welcome Venturer of rich priz'd time. Henry Elmes
To the Reader. THough I haue been euer readier to won∣der at the effect of things extraor∣dinarily strange; then wel prouided of iudgement to examine their causes, subiecting sundrie times mine eares to the report of rare and vnusuall acci∣dents, with a greater bent of attenti∣on, then perchaunce to a well tempered stayednes will seem conuenient, yet mee thinketh that this humor of mine, howso∣euer faulty, is much more excusable then that contemptuous de∣rision of Theyras, who presentlie doe condemne for false fryuo∣lous & impossible whatsoeuer is not within the narrow lymits of their own capacitie included, therein to excuse their owne ignorance by the disgrace of a better experience, for mine own part therefore, though no mans conceipt weaker or vnapter to apprehend then mine, yet I euer held it decent to yeeld a respec∣tiue gesture, and due reputation to him, that vpon his owne Wise and dis∣crere speech beautifieth the hearer and de∣lighteth the speaker.knowledge taketh vpon him to deliuer vnto the hearers mat∣ter mouing them to maruell, and such as common experience sometimes fayleth to approue, of which sort vnlesse the partia∣litie of my affection deceiue mee, there is not any that doth more beautifie the speaker or delight the hearer, then the de∣scription of forreine regions, the manners & customes of farre
distant countries, the diuetsitie of their complections, humor, diet and attire, and such like other singularities; especially if they come from the mouth of a wise and well speaking tra∣ueller, to whose tongue I could willingly endure to haue mine eares enclined, while he distilleth into them the sweet liquors that he hath industriously extracted out of the painefull fruits of his forrein trauell; nothing is here farther from my mea∣ning then those who hauing gotten a fonde affected phrase of speech, or some conceited toyes in their habite would be accoun∣ted great trauellers, because perchaunce they haue seene the clocke at Strasburge, or can talke of Maddona Margaritas pantables, such being seconded with no farther vertue, might much better haue spent their time at home: but I speake of the wiser sort; who returning amended in knowledge, and not cor∣rupted in manners, nor disguised in behauiour, haue by well spending their time abroad, enabled and made themselues fit to doe their countrie seruice, when occasion requireth, such in mine opinion are to bee esteemed, if for nothing els, yet in regard that neglecting nearer waies of gaine (by which we see at home euen the meanest capacities do arise vnto wealth, and credite) they expose themselues to many daungers, content themselues with all vnease, runne through all difficulties, sub∣iect to reprehension, and vncertaine of reward, neither ca∣ring to please their bodyes, nor to fill their purses, so they may enrich their mindes with a perpetuall directed entent to their countries good, of which sometimes they are but slenderly re∣quited, yea and oftentimes through enuie of their sufficiencie dpressed, and malitiously censured, for the most part being vsed like whetstones, who giuing edge to others, are themselues still kept bare, the cause whereof as I take it proceedeth through the miraculous fertilitie of this age, wherein wee liue, which
bringeth soorth men so rarely qualified, and of such ripe preg∣nant conceipts, that they can gather out of their soft beds, and full dishes at home, better abilitie to iudge, bolder audacity to speake, and a quicker insight to discern and censure other mens sufficiences, then others can in many yeares trauell abroad with many carefull thoughtes, industrious penuries and paineful in∣conueniences belonging vnto that life attaine vnto: it was not so in Homers time, for he vnder the person of Vlisses indeuo∣red to deseribe and patterne forth the most perfect and accom∣plished Gentleman of Greece, hee did not praise him for the nimblenesse of his tongue, the gainesse of his cloathes, nor the Vlisses praised by Homer for hauing seene many coun¦tries and the fashions of many men.boldnesse of his face, no nor for his superficiall smattering in many bookes, but he said, Multornm mores vidit & vrbes, making that the foundation whereupon to build the rest of his prayses, in fine how succesles soeuer their vertuous endenours fall out, there is no kind of people with whome I do willinglyer conuerse, as being fruitfull and pleasing in their discourses, so al∣so through their acquaintance with the ciuilitie of other nati∣ons, moderate and offenceles in their behauiour, of which sorte it hath been my happinesse to be beholding to many of sundry nations for their friendly conuersation, who neuer were so wil∣ling at any time to speake, as I euer was ready to receiue their discourses with an attentiue eare, wherein I alwaies especial∣ly obserued one thing, that whether they with whom I conferred were Englishmen, French men, Spaniards, Germains, Poloni∣ans, yea or Italians borne in the bordering prouinces, as of each sort I haue beene acquainted with many, though sundrie of them had been in the farthest parts of Asia and Affrica, yet comming once to speake of the cittie of Venice, they would in∣force their speech to the highest of all admiration, as being a thing of the greatest worthinesse, and most infinitely
remarkable, that they had seen in the whole course of their tra∣uels. Some of the youthfuller sort, would extoll to the skies their humanitie towardes straungers, the delicacie of their enter∣tainments, the beauty, pomp, & daintines of their women, & finally the infinite superflutties of all pleasure and delightes. Other of a grauer humor would dilate of the greatnes of their Empire, the grauitie of their prince, the maiesty of their Senate, the vnuiolablenes of their lawes, their zeale in religiō, and lastly their moderation, and equitie, wherewith they go∣uerne such subiected prouinces as are vnder their dominion, binding them therby in a faster bonde of obedience then all the cytadels, garrisons, or whatsoeuer other tyrannicall inuen∣tions could euer haue brought them vnto. These and such like reportes haue from time to time kindled within me so greate a desire to acquaint myselfe with the particularities of this famous Cittie, that though during the time of my trauell, (destinate to more vnhappy courses) I was not so fortunate as to bee a beholder of the glorie thereof, yet I haue not omit∣ted from time to time to gather such obseruations as well by reading the best and choicest authors entreating there of, as also by conference with sundry wel experienced gentlemē, as might not onely satisfie the curiositie of my own desire, but also deliuer vnto other a cleare and exact knowledge of euery particulari∣tie worthy of note, that thereunto appartaineth, which cannot as I imagine (the noblenesse of the subiect considered) but bee All other ex∣cellent gouern¦ments com∣prehended within that of Venice.pleasing and agreeable to the best conceipted spirits, who may out of this one commonwelth of Venice, gather and compre∣hend the fruite of all whatsoeuer other gouernments through∣out the world▪ that are of any same or excellency: for in the person of the Venetian prince, who sitting at the helme of this citie shineth in all exterior ornamentes of royall dignitie;
(neuerthelesse both he and his authority, being wholy subiected to the lawes) they may see a straunge and vnusuall forme of a most excellent Monarchie. Then what more perfect and liuely pattern of a well ordered Aristocraticall gouernment can there in the worlde bee expressed, then that of their Councell of Pregati or Sena∣tors, which being the onely chiefe and principall members of all supreame power; yet haue not any power, mean, or possibility at all to tyranize, or to peruert their Country lawes? Lastly if they desire to see a most rare and matchlesse president of a Democrasie or popular estate, let them beholde their great Councell, consisting at the least of 3000. Gentle∣men, whereupon the highest strength and mightinesse of the e∣state absolutely relyeth, notwithstanding which number all thinges are ordered with so diuine a peaceablenes, and so with∣out all tumult and confusion, that it rather seemeth to bee an assembly of Angels, then of men. In fine, whithersoeuer you turne your eyes, they shall not encounter any thing but obiectes of admiration; their iustice is pure and vncorrupted: their penall Lawes most vnpardo∣nably executed: their encouragements to vertue infinite: espe∣cially by their distribution of offices & dignities, which is orde∣red in such so secrete, strange, and intricate a sort, that it vt∣terly ouerreacheth the subtiltie of all ambitious practises, neuer falling vpon any but vpon such as are by the whole assembly al∣lowed for men of greatest wisedome, vertue and integritie of life, as by the following discourse most euidently shall appeare. But besides these before rehearsed, there are sundry other so maruellous and miraculous considerations, and in their owne exceeding singularitie, beyond all resemblance or comparison with any other Commonwealth so vnspeakeablie sirange, that their wonderfull rarenesse being verified, maketh the straun∣gest
impossibilities not seeme altogether incredible: as for ex∣ample: first touching the situation thereof, what euer hath the worlde brought forth more monstrously strange, then that so great & glorious a Citie should bee seated in the middle of the sea, especially to see such pallaces, monasteries, temples, towers, turrets, & pinacles reaching vp vnto the cloudes, founded vp∣on Quagmires, and planted vppon such vnfirme moorish and spungie foundations, there being neytherwood, nor stone, nor matter fit for building within tenne miles thereof, for so farre distant from it was the nearest maine land, at such time as the first foundation was laide? Besides, what is there that can carrie a greater disproportion with common rules of experience, thē that vnweaponed men in gownes should with such happinesse of successe giue direction & law to many mightie and warlike armies both by sea and land, and that a single Citie vnwalled, and alone should command & ouer toppe mighty kingdomes, and such famous farre extended prouinces, remayning euer it selfe inuincible, and long robed citizens to bee serued, yea and sued vnto for entertainment by the greatest princes & peeres of Italy: amidst which infinit af∣fluence of glorie, and vnmeasurable mightinesse of power, of which there are in soueraignty pertakers aboue 3000. gentle∣men, yet is there not one among them to bee found that doth a∣spire to any greater appellation of honour, or higher tytle of dig∣nitie then to be called a Gentleman of Venice, including in the same the height of all imaginable honour, so deare vnto this generous people is the name and loue of their noble country? And lastly, though not least to be wondred at, they haue (as it were entertayning a league & intelligence with the heauen∣ly powers) preserued this royall Citie of theirs this 13. hundred yeares since the first foundation thereof, in an estate so perpetu∣ally flourishing & vnblemished, that though sundry & mighty
kinges and Emperours being enamored with her beauty and goodlinesse, haue with maruellous endeuour and multitude of armies sought to possesse themselues of so faire and precious a pray: yet haue they hitherto kept her like a pure and vntouch∣ed virgine, free from the taste or violence of any forraine en∣forcement. The strange beginning, mighty increase and long continu∣ing greatnesse of this happy commowea th hath serued to many present writers for the glorious subiect of their learned histo∣ries: among the rest he that hath written thereof with greatest iudgement & authoritie in my opinion, is the Cardinal Gasper Contareno, by birth a Gentleman, and by desert and worthi∣nesse at that time a Senator of Venice: but being now aboue fourescore years since he wrote the same; since which time there haue succeeded many alterations of lawes, and changes of mat∣ters in his country, I thought it not unnecessarie to adde there∣vnto sundrie other particularities, gathered (as I said) partly by conference, partly by reading of other learned Authors, as Donato, Iustinian, Munster, Bodin, Ant, Stella, San∣souino, Domenico Francesco, Girolamo Bardi &c. Contareno did first write this treatise in Latine, the same being since his time translated into Italian by a Gentleman of Italie, which translation I haue here chiefly followed, though still comparing the same with the Latine originall, in regarde of my desire to expresse the proper names of their Magistrates, lawes, and ceremonies according to their common appellations, which is much altered in the Latine stile: I will not speake of my paines herein, nor enter into any insinuating challenge of thankes, for in truth I haue neither taken the one, nor deserued the other, hauing written it at idle times when I had nothing els to doe, being at much more leysure then willingly I woulde bee.
But me thinkes I heare it vbrayded vnto me, that it is now rather a time to doe then to write: I confesse it to be so for him that is well set on worke: and yet hee that writeth well is neuer the farther off from doing well: so that for my part I holde it no disgrace to write so long as my penne vttereth no d shonestie. My education hath been in the wars: this I onely doc to beguile time; wishing that whosoeuer shall herein censure mee amisse, would be as ready as my selfe, both in minde and body, when ey∣ther the cōmandement of my prince, or the occasion of my coun∣trie shalinioine me to other courses: in the meanetime vtterly carelesse of mine owne praise, I yet intreate them that shal reade this discourse, to intertaine this famous Common wealth with all friendlinesse and fauour, if in no other regarde, yet in this, that therest of the whole world honoreth her with the name of a Virgin, a name though in all places most sacred & venerable, yet in no place more dearely and religiously to bee reuerenced, then with us, who haue thence deriued our blessednesse, which I beseech God may long continue among vs. Lewes Lewkenor. LO here describ'd though but in little roome Faire Venice, like a spouse in Neptunes armes, For freedome Emulus to ancient Rome, Famous for councell much, & much for armes, Whose story earst written with Tuscan quill, Lay to the English wits as halfe concealed, Till Lewkners learned trauell, and his skill In well grac'd stile, and phrase hath it reuealed: Venice be proud that thus augments thy fame, England be kind enricht with such a booke, Both giue the honor to that worthy Dame, For whom this taske the writer vndertooke. Iohn Harington.
The First Booke of the Magistrates and Commonwealth of the Venetians. I Hauing oftentimes obserued many strangers, men wise & learned, who arriuing newly at Venice, and be∣holding The admira∣tion of stran∣gers at their first ariuall at Venice.the beautie and magnifi∣cence thereof, were stricken with so great an admiration and amaze∣ment, that they woulde, and that with open mouth confesse, neuer any thing which be∣foretime they had seene, to be thereunto comparable, either in glory or goodlinesse. Yet was not euery one of thē possessed with the like wonder of one same particu∣lar thing: for to some it seemed a matter of infinit mar∣uaile, and scarcely credible to behold, so vnmeasurable a The causes of their admira∣tion diuers.quantity of all sorts of marchandise to be brought out of all realmes and countries into this Citie, and hence a∣gaine to be conueyed into so many straunge and far di∣stant nations, both by land and sea. Others exceeding∣ly admired the wonderful concourse of strange and for∣raine people, yea of the farthest and the remotest nati∣ons, as though the City of Venice onely were a common and generall market to the whole world. Others were astonished at the greatnesse of the empire thereunto be∣longing, and the mightinesse of their state both by land and sea: but the greater part of the most wise and iudi∣ciall sort were rather in themselues confounded with a∣mazement at the new and strange manner of the situa∣tion of this Citie, so fitte and conuenient for all thinges,
that it seemed vnto them a thing rather framed by the hands of the immortall Gods, then any way by the arte▪ industry, or inuention of men. And for this onely cause deemed the Citie of Venice to excell all those, that in this age are to be found, or at any time euer were. Nei∣ther altogether without reason, for surely if you looke into former ages, & likewise into this wherein we liue, you shall hardly find any cittie comparable with this of ours, eyther for greatnes of Empire, frequencie of peo∣ple, or aboundance and magnificence of thinges. But No city eyther now or in any other age cō∣parable in all points with the citie of Venice.especially for situation, neuer was there since the memo∣rie of men, any citie seated in so opportune a place, so secure, and exceeding the beliefe of men. Some in building of Cities, imagined they had well and suffici∣ently done, if they had chosen a place hard of accesse, or difficult for their enemies to besiege or assault the same: whereby it commeth, that sundry Citties are seated on the toppes of high hilles, with sharpe and vneasie pas∣sages, or else in moorish and fennish places: some again for other diuers respects haue imagined nothing to be preferred before an apt and commodious seate, fitte to conuoy in and out all such thinges as appertaine to the making of a Cittie plentifull and magnificent, aswell in matters of necessitie, as delicacie. Of which both points ioyntly you shall find few that haue beene carefull, few∣er that haue attempted it, but vnlesse I be deceiued, ne∣uer any one that hath in all points accomplished it. But the situation of Venice being rather to be attribu∣ted to some diuine prouidence, then to any humane industry, is (beyond the beliefe of all those that haue not seene this cittie) not onely most safe and secure, both by land and sea from all violence, but also in the highest
degree opportune & commodious to the aboundance of all thinges that are behoouefull to the citizens, as al∣so for traffique of all sortes of marchandise, in manner with all nations of the worlde. The situation of the citie of Venice. For it is seated in a remote and secrete place of the Adriatike sea, where on that side (where the sea behold∣eth the continent) there are mightie great lakes; fortified with an admirable artifice of nature. For twelue miles off from the continent, the sea beginneth to be shallow: and among those flats & lakes there ariseth vp a shore or banke like vnto a hill, which seruing as a fortresse against the waues & violences of the sea, maketh all the inwarde harbor (being very wide & spacious) so secure, that not onely the vehemence of the sea, when through the rage of any tempest it ariseth, is repressed and kept backe, but also the ships that arriue, are debarred of free and ea∣sie entrance, in so much that if they be not of very light burthen, they are forced to cast anker at the mouth of the passages or entries, and thence, when the weather is calme and quiet, being guided by skilfull pilots, or ra∣ther by certaine particular men experimented in those shallowes and channels, they may at length come vnto the cittie by a narrow, crooked and intricate way, where the water is of greater depth, the same in a manner eue∣ry day altering and chaunging according to the tides of the sea. The banke which ariseth behind these shallowes, rea∣cheth almost threescore miles, and incloseth the lakes within. Neuerthelesse the same is not so entire, but that there is a rupture in seuen places thereof, which maketh an entry to the roade within, and it is six miles off from the Continent.
In this manner therefore are the lakes of the Citie of Venice inclosed, partly with firme ground, partly with Ryalta.this banke and shallowes: in middle of the which, in that place, which of our auncestors was called Rialta, and as yet retaineth the name, was the Citie of Venice builded, at such time as the Hunnes vnder the conduct The cause of the first buil∣ding of the City of Veniceof Atyla did spoile with fire and sword the territory of Venetia, a noble prouince of Italie, which bordered vpon those lakes: in which calamitous time the citizens of Pa∣dua, of Aquilea, of VderZo, of Concordia, and of Altina, being all faire and goodly cities of Venetia, such of them as were chiefe in riches, and nobility, did first get them∣selues with their families into certaine Ilands, or rather little hilles, which did appeare out somewhat aboue the sea, and there built them places of abode, in which as in a secure hauen they auoyded the ragefull tempest of the Hunnes. There were likewise in that troublesome season cer∣tain castles built vpon the banke, of which I made men∣tion, to which the inhabitantes of that coast repaired, leaning their ancient homes spoyled and ruined by the Hunnes, seeking there a safe abode for their wiues and children, and as I may say for their houshold Gods. Afterwards in the times of the kings, Charles and Pe∣pin, all such as scatteringly inhabited these places, by common consent retyred themselues vnto the Ryalta, as into a place of greater security, & much more commo∣cious then any of the rest: so that in the end by the con∣course of such as coulde auoide the ruines of Italy, wrought by the cruelty of barbarous nations, Venice by degrees augmented it selfe into that greatnesse, in which we now do see it.
It is manifest therefore, that the seat of this Citie must needes bee exceedingly secure, in regarde that the first building thereof was vndertaken by men, who to auoid the calamities of Italy, in midst of so great a miserie, re∣mained there in most sound and quiet safetie with their Venice hath remained vn∣touched from the violence of any enemy since the first building there of, which is a∣boue 1100▪ yeares.families. But which is more, since those times (which we haue not read hath happened to any other city) from the first building therof, euen vntil this time, being now a thousand and one hundred yeares, it hath preserued it selfe free and vntouched from the violence of any ene∣mie, though being most opulent and furnished, aswell of gold and siluer, as of all other thinges that might, yea euen from the farthest parts of the world allure the Bar∣bares to so rich a bootie and spoile. So that I doe not disalow their opinion, that haue deemed the Citie of Venice, to excell and go beyond all other Cities. But yet there is one thing more in this citie, which not one∣ly in my iudgement farre exceedeth all those thinges, which wee haue spoken of, but likewise in all their opi∣nions, that do not account a Citie to bee the walles and houses onely, but rather the assemblie and order of the citizens, chiefly and with greatest worthinesse to chal∣lenge that name, and this is the true reason, manner, & forme of commonwealthes, through which men en∣ioy a happie and quiet life: This is that rare and excel∣lent thing, wherein Venice seemeth to shine, and to sur∣passe all antiquitie, for though it is apparant that there hath beene many commonwealthes, which haue farre exceeded Venice as well in empire and greatnesse of e∣state, as in militarie discipline and glory of the wars: yet hath there not beene any, that may bee paragond with this of ours, for institutions & lawes prudently decreed,
to establish vnto the inhabitantes a happie and prospe∣rous felicitie, the proofe whereof is made manifest by the long continuance thereof in such security and hap∣pinesse, which when I consider with my self, I am wont greatly to wonder at the wisedome of our ancestors, at their industry, the vertue of their minds, & their incredi∣ble loue and charity towardes their country. There were in Athens, Lacedaemon and Rome, in sundry seasons sundry rare and vertuous men of excellent desert, and singular pietie towardes their country, but so fewe, that being ouerruled by the multitude they were not able much to profite the same. But our auncestors, from whome wee haue receyued so flourishing a common∣wealth, all in one did vnite themselues in a consenting The nobility of Venice not so ambitious of their owne as of their countries ho∣nor.desire to establish, honour, and amplifie their country, without hauing in a manner any the least regarde of their owne priuate glorie or commodity. And this any man may easily coniecture, that the nobilitie of Venice was neuer so ambitious of any priuate matter pertay∣ning to themselues, as they were alwayes infinitely zea∣lous of the honour, commodity and aduancement of their country, in regarde that there are in Venice to bee found none, or very few monuments of our auncestors, though both at home and abroad many things were by them gloriously atchieued, and they of passing and sin∣gular desart towards their countrie. There are no state∣ly ecchi di nauitombes erected, no military statues remaining, no stemmes of ships, no ensignes, no standrads taken from their enemies, after the victory of many and mighty battailes. Andreas Con∣tareno Duke of Venice. I wil among innumerable others touch onely the ex∣ample of Andraeas Contareno an ancestor of mine: who
being prince of our commonwealth in the Genowes war, the greatest and most dangerous that euer we endured, did not onely preserue our countrey with his singular wisedome, and maruellous greatnesse of courage, but did so vtterly ouerthrow our enemies (they triumphing euen then as it were in an assured victory) that they in a manner were all eyther slaine or taken prisoners. Finally, hauing so mightily preserued his country, and amplified and established the commonwealth, hee passed out of this life, or dayning by testament, that on his sepulcher (which at this day is to be seene in S. Stephens church) there should not be placed any armes or ensignes of our familie: neither, which is more, is there so much as the name of so great a Duke engraued, but rather by his mo∣destie is it come to passe, that the sepulcher of so famous & excellent a prince is in a manner vtterly vnknowen. I imagine this to be a most certain argument, that our auncestors delighted not in vaineglorie or ambition, but had only their intentiue care to the good of their coun∣try and common profite. With this then exceeding vertue of mind did our auncestors plant and settle this such a commonwealth, that since the memory of men, whosoeuer shal go about to make compare between the same & the noblest of the ancients, shal scarcely find any such: but rather I dare affirme, that in the discourses of those great Philosophers, which fashioned & forged cō∣monwealths according to the desires of the mind, there is not any to be founde so well fayned and framed, for which cause I thought I should doe a thing very grate∣full to strangers, if I shoulde describe the order of so re∣nowned a commonwealth: especially because in this time among the number of so many men learned, and
of pregnant wits, ripe in the knowledge of all things, and excelling in eloquence, I see not any that hath vnderta∣ken this honorable taske. To which though I know the weakenesse of our stile cannot yeeld any ornament, yet the same is of it selfe so noble, that it is able not onely to yeeld dignitie to it selfe, but also to the vnworthinesse of my speech. Being therefore determined to write of this our com∣monwealth, to the end that euery one may know whe∣ther the same be well or ill disposed, I thinke it best to take my beginning from hence. That man is by nature made a ciuile creature, but a∣lone by himselfe, neither able to liue well, not to liue at all, which euery daies necessitie, and the manner of vic∣tuailing and clothing approueth: and for this cause e∣uen from the beginning did men enter into ciuile socie∣tie, and therein continued to the ende, that so they might liue happily and commodiously, which is, that with mutuall helpe and diligence they might obtaine the chief good incident to men, so long as the course of this their mortal life endureth, wherunto the whole rea∣son of ciuil institution pertaineth, that by the easiest way No life happy and blessed but that which contayneth in it the vse of vertue.possible the citizens may be made possessors of a happy life. But a life happie and blessed is so tearmed of great Philosophers, the which containeth in it selfe the vse of vertue, which they do approue with most assured rea∣sons and vndenyable arguments. Now the vse of ver∣tue appeareth as well in the offices of warre, as in the functions of peace: which notwithstanding though the praise of warre, and the manner of discipline thereunto belonging, be necessary to a Citie, for the preseruation of the libertie and defence of the confines, and contay∣neth
in it selfe great dignitie and goodlinesse: yet the common sence of men doth not allow these offices of warre (by which the ruine and slaughter of mankinde is procured) to be for themselues desired, and that all other ciuile offices should be thereunto referred: for it were the token of an vnciuile disposition, or rather of a man hating humanitie to wish for warres, slaughters, & burnings, for this onely cause that he might be famous in matters of warre, and adde thereunto (if it please you) that he might be honored with the name of a great cap∣tain: wherefore all philosophers of greatest marke haue Warre is to be desired for the cause of peace.in this one point agreed, that warre is to be desired for the cause of peace, and that the whole function of mili∣tarie vertue, and the commendation thereof ought to be referred to the offices of peace: wherefore that go∣uernour of a commonwealth that would be accounted worthy of praise, & (as the saying is) a man perfectly ac∣complished, ought to vse that temperature, & to main∣taine that order, that the whole commonwealth may seeme accommodated to vertue, and withall, that it bee rather thought to attend to the exercises of peace, then to the offices of warre, yet in the meane time not con∣temning such thinges as pertaine to the discipline of warres; because many times the militare vertue (so that the same be vsed without iniurie) is necessary to defend and to enlarge the confines. But things being once or∣dered as we haue said, it is wont then to be doubted of, whether it bee better that one or few haue the gouern∣ment of the whole citie, or rather the whole multitude, as many doe describe the estate of that, which ought properly to be called a commonwealth. And truely to me it seemeth exceedingly well and wisely said of them,
Howsoeuer the successe hath allowed the gouern∣ment of Ve∣nice, either in regard of the smalnesse of their ter¦ritory, or the strong situati∣on of their ci∣tie: yet there was neuer any example of a∣ny other great cōmonwealth but that did soone perish by the plurali∣ty of commā∣ders: all great philosophers chiefly extol∣ling the mo∣narchy; & all course of times & ex∣amples con∣firming their opinion. that deemed the gouernment of men to bee vnfitly granted to one alone, but that there should bee a thing more diuine to whom this office should be giuen, as out of many sorts of creatures may be gathered. For a sheep gouerneth not a flock of sheep, nor an oxe, nor an horse a heard of oxen, or horses; but a creature more excellent defendeth and gouerneth them, which is man, which is a thing manifest to al men, of how much more worth he is then those brute creatures: by the like reason (if so it might be brought to passe) should man be gouerned by som thing more diuine & excellent thē man, but see∣ing in worldly things (which are with sence perceiued) there is nothing found more excellent thē man, & man being a certaine diuerse creature, & consisting of diffe∣rent parts, as hauing the inferior forces of his mind cō∣mon, as it were with brutish creatures: but with the su∣perior powers therof, participating (in a manner) with the immortal Gods: that rightly ought amongst men to obtain the place of gouernment & rule, which is in man highest & of greatest participation with dignity: which is as all men do acknowledge the mind, being by nature grafted in vs as a beame of the heauēly brightnes: ther∣fore euil shal that commonwealth be prouided for, that That ought a∣mongst men to obtaine the place of go∣uernment and rule, which is in mā highest, & of greatest participation with diuinitie.shal be committed to the gouernment of a man, whom many times those inferior and brutish powers doe per∣turbe, & call backe from the true path of reason: but that office is rather to be committed to the mind, pure and void of perturbations: wherefore by a certaine diuine counsell when by other meanes it might not, mankinde through the inuention of lawes seemeth to haue attai∣ned this point, that this office of gouerning assemblings of men should be giuen to the minde and reason onely:
the same being free from passion, which among many other the infinit blessings & gifts of heauen, is not to be accounted in the lowest, but rather the highest ranke, if we will truely consider the vtilitie of lawes: for first in enacting them, many wise men meete together, who by long vse growen skilfull in many things, by compa∣ring the inuentions and examples of others with their owne experience, do at length after long consultation determine that which shall seeme best vnto them, their minds being then directly bent to vertue, free from ha∣tred, friendship, or other perturbation: the cause of no The excellency of lawes.priuate man being interessed in the establishing of laws, which in courses of mans iudgement often happeneth. But after that lawes once are enacted, if any then trans∣gresse them, & chaunce to suffer the punishments that they inflict, he cannot in reason blame any man, and in this case it is not to be feared that any sedition or rancor growne among the citizens, being the greatest & most dangerous contagion of cōmonwealths: whereas con∣trariwise when any man is punished by the iudgement of men not fortified with lawes, great & grieuous enmi∣ties do sundry times ensue; for it scarcely can be chosen, but that we remaine ill affected towards him, of whom we haue receiued harme, so that I cannot well resolue whether mankind be more beholding for any other The inuenti∣on of lawes was by the ancients, con∣secrated vnto the immortall Gods.thing to nature the mother of all things, then it is for this inuention of lawes, which was of the ancients and not vnworthely consecrated to the immortall Gods: but which serueth more meruailous, Aristotle ptince of philosophers, in that booke of the world which he did dedicat to great Alexāder, found not any thing to which he might likelier resemble God, thē to an autentike law
in a Citie rightly gouerned: so that the opinion of this great philosopher was in manner, that God was the same in the vniuersity of things, as an ancient lawe in a ciuill company: and in his bookes wherein hee entrea∣teth of a commonwealth, he tearmeth law to be a mind without appetite, which is to say pure, cleare, and free from the infirmitie of any passion, whereby any man, of how slow conceit soeuer, may perceiue the fitnesse & necessitie of that of which we spake before: that is, that something more diuine then man shoulde rule and go∣uerne the companies of men: for a man being aduanced to this office of gouernement, (as men endued with wisedome, and integrity are rare) and they for the most part may erre in iudging and decerning things through the force of their affections, which do perturbe and di∣uert the mind from her true course and intention, it fol∣lowes of necessitie, that thinges cannot go so currant as they should, yea though it might be so, that wee might find out a man so wise and vertuous, and of such sted∣fast constancic, that no perturbation were able to make his mind recoile from his duetie, yet neither on this con∣dition were the rule of man to be wished for before the gouernment of lawes: for he being of a mortall & fraile nature could not long enioy that function, when lawes (as I said) do in a manner concurre with eternitie. By these I thinke it sufficiently persuaded, that the souerain∣ty of gouernment should be recommended not to men but to lawes, to whose will yet some few thinges may be permitted, that are not well in lawes to bee compre∣hended: neuerthelesse it is necessary, that there bee A Gardian of the lawes.made a certaine Gardian as Liestenant and minister of the laws, who may gouerne the commonwealth accor∣ding
to the rule of the lawes. And because all those thinges that come into iudgement cannot be compre∣hended in lawes, that he then be an arbiter & ruler of those matters that are in question: now againe retur∣neth that controuersie of constitution of lawes, which Whether a few or the whole multi∣tude be to bee preferred to the defence of of the lawes.to some might seeme already decided, that is to say, whether one, or a few, or the whole multitude, be to be preferred to the defence of the lawes, & to iudge those things that do not fal into the comprehension of lawes. And though in the opinion of many men, the kingly domination is of highest esteeme and greatest account: neuerthelesse I shoulde thinke that though the prin∣cipalitie of one alone, that should lawfully, and by right challenge to himselfe the dignity of a king: if the mat∣ter be by it selfe considered, shoulde seeme of all other the best, yet in regarde of the breuitie of life, and mans fraile disposition, which for the most parte enclineth to the worser parte, the gouernment of the multitude is farre more conuenient to the assemblie of citizens, which experience the mistresse of all thinges doth ele∣gantly teach vs, because that wee haue not read that there was among auncientes any souerainty of a king, neyther haue wee in our time seene any that had not soone declyned into tiranny: on the contrary side ma∣ny commonwealthes that haue continued prosperous∣ly many ages, and flourished both in peace and warre, yet is the whole multitude of it selfe vnapt to gouerne, vnlesse the same be in some sort combined together; for No ciuil soci∣ety can remain perfect, vnlesse the same be in a vnity contai∣ned.there cannot bee a multitude without the same bee in some vnitie contayned; so that the ciuill society (which consisteth in a certaine vnity) will bee dissolued, if the multitude become not one by some meane of reason, so
that the best philosophers, and those that haue learned∣lyest written of the ordering of a commonwealth, iudg∣ed that in the gouernment therof there should be a tem∣perature betweene the state of nobility & popular sort, to the ende that the inconueniences of either gouern∣mental one might be auoided, and the commodities of both ioyntly inioyed, for which cause they doe highly The common¦wealth of the Lacedemoni∣ans gouerned by the king, the Ephores & the Senate. The same wholly in∣stituted to the offices & ex∣ercises of war.commend the commonwealth of the Lacedemonians, in which the kings, the Ephores, & the senates made a cer∣tain mixture, so that it is hard to decipher vnder what sort of gouernment the same can be placed: onely this they reprehend, that it was onely instituted to the offi∣ces of war without any regard of the offices of peace & quietnesse, wherby it came to passe, that the same being glorious, and renowned in many excellent vertues so soon as euer it began to liue at quiet, presently declined, & at length vtterly fell to ruine: which also and for the same cause befell the Romaines, neyther was the euent thereof vnforeseene of sundry of the chiefe Senators, The cause of the ruine of the Lacede∣monian & Romane com∣monwealth.among the which Nasica was of opinion, that Carthage (though enuious of the Romane greatnesse, and as it were in competencie withall) ought not to haue beene ruined, to the end that Rome might still haue an enemie with whom to occupie it selfe in armes: lest their e∣nemie and corriuall being taken away, the common∣wealth being instituted to warre, and the youth nouri∣shed in armes, they shoulde turne their weapons vpon themselues, which counsell of Nasica though it was then refused of the Senates, and the contrary decreed: neuertheles the euēt proued the same to haue bin most wise & prudent: for Carthage being destroyed, presently (in a manner) they burst out into ciuill warres through
which at length the same being the most flourishing & mighty commonwealth that euer was, fel downe to the ground, and that Citie abounding in such opulency, as being in manner Queene of the worlde, became a pray to the barbarous. But to come now at length to our determined taske, it appeareth that our auncestors, which instituted the commonwealth of Venice, were men indued with admirable wisedome and vertue, in that they omitted nothing which might seeme to per∣taine to the right institution of a commonwealth: for first they ordayned the whole life and exercise of their citizens to the vse and office of vertue, and alwaies with greater regard and reckoning applyed their minds to the maintenance of peace then to glorie of warres: The Veneti∣ans applyed their minds, more to the maintenance of peace then to the glory of wars.bending alwaies their chiefest care and studie to the preseruation of ciuill concorde and agreement among themselues, not in the mean time neglecting warlike of∣fices, such (I meane) as were fitte and conuenient for our Citie, of which the situation is such, that it ser∣ueth well, and is commodious for warres by sea, but vnfitte for warres by land: for neyther squadrons of horsemen, nor troupes of footmen can by any meanes be accomodated thereunto, as by my former descrip∣tion, thereof may easily bee coniectured. Besides, they vsed such a moderation and temperature, and such a mixture of all estates, that this onely cittie retayneth a princely soueraigntie, a gouernment of the nobilitie, & a popular authority, so that the formes of them all seeme to be equally ballanced, as it were with a paire of weights, as more plainely hereafter shall appeare. But now finally to come to the institutiō of our Vene∣tian commonwealth, the whole authority of the city frō
whose decrees and lawes aswell the senate as all other The great councell in which consi∣fteth the whol authority of the common∣wealth of Venice.magistrates deriue their power and authority, is in that councell, into which all the gentlemen of the Citie be∣ing once past the age of 25. yeares, are admitted: and sundry of them not yet come to that age, so that they be full twentie, which priuiledge they obtaine by the benefite of lottes: of which hereafter we will discourse the whole manner: Now first I am to yeeld you a rec∣koning how and with what wisedome it was ordayned by our auncestors, that the common people should not bee admitted into this company of citizens, in whose authority consisteth the whole power of the common wealth, then that this definition of citizens was not with lesse wisedome measured, rather by the nobility of li∣nage, then the greatnes of wealth, as in auncient com∣monwealthes it was wont, & as many old philosophers do prescribe: for though the citie is the company of ci∣tizens: yet all those men whose trauaile the Citie nee∣deth, yea and that dwell within the walles thereof, are not generally to bee reckoned in the number, nor regi∣stred in the right of citizens: for euery citie standeth in neede of artificers, and many mercenarie people, and hired seruants, of which none can bee truely tearmed a citizen: for a citizen is a free man, but those are all ser∣uile, eyther priuately or publikely: for mercenarie men Mercenary men and arti∣ficers to be held as pub∣like seruants.& artificers, are all to be accounted as publique seruants: for it is to bee beleeued that a liuing creature is not o∣therwise made of nature, then it is needefull that the citie should bee of men: for as in a liuing creature are many partes that haue no life, yet the creature needeth them towardes the maintenance of life: so in a compa∣ny of citizens, there is a necessary vse of many men,
who neuerthelesse ought neither to bee, nor to be repu∣ted or placed in the number of citizens: for which cause it was wisely ordayned of our ancestors, that the whole people should not haue power in this commonwealth, which they desired to fashion in the highest degree of perfection. Because many troubles & popular tumults arise in those citties, whose gouernment is swaied by the common people, which we haue also read, hath beene obserued in sundry commonwealthes, & also deliuered in way of precept by many and great philosophers, yet many were of contrarie opinion, deeming that it would doe well, if this manner of gouerning the common∣wealth should rather bee defined by abilitie and abun∣dance of riches: but here againe they fell into great ab∣surdities The absurdity of those that elect the rulers & magistrates of their com∣monwealth by the abun∣dance of their riches.and no small inconueniences: for it happeneth often that those of the basest sort, yea of the very skum of the people, do scrape together great wealth, as those that apply themselues to filthy artes, and illiberall occu∣pations, neuer sparing the toilesome and carefull wea∣ring out of their liues, but with an intollerable sauing, defrauding themselues of the comforts of life, thereby to increase their substance. Contrariwise the honest ci∣tizens, and those that are liberally brought vppe, often∣times fall to pouertie, either (as it often happeneth) by aduerse fortune, or els that being wholly addicted to noble and liberall studies, they neglect the increasing of their wealth: whereby it commeth that filthy and ill mannerd men sauouring of nothing but gaine, vtterly ignorant of good artes, by little and little come to go∣uerne the commonwealth: and those that are honest & of liberall condition by the decay of their substance, do loose the right of citizens, wherby of necessity there
must arise great seditions and troubles to the common∣wealth. Therefore our wise and prudent ancestors, lest their commonwealth should happen into these calami∣ties, ordered that this definition of the publike rule, Nobility of li∣neage to be in election of magistrates preferred be∣fore riches.should go rather by the nobility of lineage, then by the estimation of wealth: yet with that temperature, that men of chiefe & supreme nobilitie should not haue this rule alone (for that wold rather haue been the power of a few then a commonwealth) but also euery other citi∣zen whosoeuer not ignobly borne: so that all which were noble by birth, or enobled by vertue, or well de∣seruing of the commonwealth, did in the beginning ob∣tain this right of gouernment: which hath likewise hap∣pened in these times of ours, yea and some forrain men and strangers haue beene adopted into this number of Strangers sometimes a∣dopted into the right of citi∣zens by the Venetians.citizens, eyther in regard of their great nobility, or that they had beene dutifull towardes the state, or els had done vnto them some notable seruice. This whole as∣sembly therefore of the citizens (or as commonly it is termed) this great councell (vpon whose authority the whole power of this commonwealth, as also the digni∣tie of the senat and of all the magistrates dependeth) re∣presenteth The Duke ru∣leth during life.in this commonwealth the forme of a popu∣lar state. The Duke who hath no time of gouernment limited vnto him, but ruleth during life, beareth the shew of a kingly power, representing in all thinges the glory, grauitie and dignity of a king: the rest of the citi∣zens do beare him honor and reuerence as vnto a king: & all decrees, lawes, and publike letters go forth vnder his name. But the Senate, the tenne, the colledge of el∣ders or chiefe counsellors, which amongst vs of the cō∣mon people are commonly called the sages: those I say
which do consult of matters, & after from the common∣wealth do make report vnto the Senat, carry with them a certaine shew of an Aristocracy or gouernment of the nobilitie: which seeing they are the chiefe parts of this commonwealth, before we come to the meaner magi∣strates; we will speake particularly of these. We wil take our beginning from the greater councell, vpon which the whole commonwealth dependeth. All yong men of the nobilitie, which haue accom∣plished Yong Gentle∣men at 20. yeares of their age admitted to the great councell of Venice.the age of 20. years, do go vnto the office which commonly is called aduocatory, to which the defence of the lawes chiefly belongeth: before which presen∣ting themselues with their father, or with their mother: if he be dead, or in case of both their wants, with some neere kinseman, they doe proue with the witnesse be∣sides of two honest men (neither of them being of the mothers kindred) themselues to be borne of that father whom they alledge, not bastards, but in lawfull matri∣mony, & that their mother liued in fame of an honest woman. The witnesses sweare in this manner, that they do manifestly know it by the report and consent of An oath taken in the behalfe of the yong gentlemen before they are admitted into the coun∣cell.al those that know them. Then the father or the mother or (they both wanting) the kinsemen affirme with the oath, that the young man hath passed his 20. yeares: which thinges after they are directly registred by the clearke of the office, they then attend the fourth day of the moneth of Decemb. on which day the names of all these yong men that haue not yet by lotte obtained the right of citizens, nor are not passed 25. years old, are put into a pot, and carried vnto the prince, & there the same set before the counsellors, with which there is another pot, wherin are round balles equall with the number of the names writē in the first, euery one hauing his marks;
the fift part of these balles is guilded with gold, the rest with siluer: the prince taketh out of the first potte the name, and then out of the next potte the ball, which if he be of the golden sort, the young man whose name was drawen, hath presently the authority of publike power, and is admitted into the great counsaile, but if it be of the siluered, he leeseth for that time his right, and expecteth his fortune of the yeare to come, vnlesse in the meane time hee accomplish the 25. yeare of his age: for euery gentleman comming to that age hath presently the right of a citizen, and is made pertaker of the publike authoritie, by this meanes the fift part of the noble yong men, that put themselues to this tryall, is e∣uery yeare admitted and enabled to giue his voyce with the other citizens: but if it so happen that the fa∣ther or grandfather of any gentleman, eyther in regard of absence or other cause, had neuer vsed this publique right, nor his name neuer beene registred in the com∣mon booke, that contayneth the names of all the nobi∣litie (lest there should be any fraud vsed, or lest any ba∣stard shoulde vnder hande enter into this company of No bastard admitted for noble.gentlemen) they would not that this matter should bee iudged and determined of onely by the office of the ad∣uocatory magistrates, but it is prouided for by a lawe, that they should proue their nobilitie by witnesses and publike writings, and that the aduocators should make The counsell of the .report ouer to the forty men, and so the cause being vn∣derstood and throughly examined and debated of by the forty men, it is at length iudged whether the party pretending is to be admitted for noble or no. But to the end that no one shoulde scotfree aduen∣ture the triall of this iudgement, it was also prouided,
that whosoeuer should vndertake this proofe of his no∣bilitie, shoulde first bring vnto the magistrate fiue hun∣dred crownes of gold, by them to be put into the trea∣sure, in case the pretendant speed not in his suit. Such was the diligence of our ancestors, to the end that this congregation of nobility should no way be defiled. For which cause those very citizens which are nobly borne, and haue past their 25. yeares, obtaine not yet the au∣thority of giuing their voices, till being so presented before the magistrates, they proue the accomplish∣ment of the age by the othe of their father, mother, or neere kinseman, and also by two witnesses, that they were born of that gentleman, who they say was their fa∣ther, not bastards, nor of a mother any way reproched. Now that we haue expressed the whole manner by which the citizens do enter into the publike authoritie, I thinke it worthy to be marked, that our ancestors did deeme it a thing of great moment for the maintenance of the citizens in vnitie and loue, if they did often meet and assemble together. Therefore as wel by lawes as by prescription of time, it is an ancient custome that this The great coūcel assem∣bled euery eight day.great counsaile should be assembled euery eight day, & sometimes oftner. The especiall office of which is to create all the magistrates: aswell those that administer iustice in the cittie, and inioy other offices in the com∣monwealth, as the senate, the tenne, the Pretors, the Captaines and treasurers of castles and Citties, which are vnder the fellowship of the Venetian empire, as also the gouernors of sortresses, the General of their nauie, their ambassadors, captaines of their gallies, and final∣ly to conclude all in a word, all those whosoeuer abroad or at home, haue charge vnder the commonwealth.
Likewise all such lawes as pertain to the constitution of the cōmonwealth, are enacted by the authority of this councell, which is especially vsed to be done when the Duke is dead, there being no new successor as yet crea∣ted. But this shalbe spoken of more hereafter. Now we wil expresse the whole manner of creating The order of the Session house.magistrates. Euery holliday in manner about noone this great councell is assembled into a great and spaci∣ous Ten very long benches in the hall where the great councell is kept.hall, which we will call the Session house. There are in the same ten exceeding long benches, equalling in manner the length of the hall: the cittizens sit downe e∣uery one when they come, where it pleaseth them, for there is no place appointed to any, except to some Ma∣gistrates of chiefe authority, as the Duke, the Counsel∣lors, & the three presidents of the fortie, which sit on a higher seate, & onely haue authoritie to make report o∣uer to the great Councell. After these the Aduocatory magistrates, and the three heads of the tenne sit downe in their appointed places, in the midst of certaine ben∣ches, that are also somewhat higher then the rest, & are close adioyning to the wall of the hall, & at length very farre from the Duke are the seates of the olde and new auditors, of whom we will speake more hereafter. But the rest of the citizens (as I said) sit downe without a∣ny place appointed where it pleaseth them. Then at an appointed houre the dores of the Session house are shut fast, & the keyes brought to the Tribunal of the prince, & there laid at his feete. Then the chiefe Chauncellor (which though it be not an honor of the nobilitie, yet it is of very great dignity) standeth vp, & from a high e∣minent place declareth what roomes and offices are va∣cant, & then to be prouided for▪ which being pronoun∣ced,
he passeth straight from that place to the Tribunal of the Prince, and there with a loude voyce citeth the Magistrates being Presidentes of the sessions (as is saide before) that they should come to the Prince, or to the Counsellors if the prince be away. They being sum∣moned do presently come, and there with oth do pro∣mise to do their vttermost diligence, that the lawes may be obserued, and that they will not in these offices pro∣nounce any citizen, that shall any way haue violated the decrees, but that they will cause such a one to be se∣uerely punished, according to the rigor of the lawes: which ceremony being ended, euery one returneth to his place except one of the aduocators, and one of the heades of the tenne, which go to the farthest part of the hall right opposite against the princes seat, & there sitte downe in appointed places. The other aduocators sitte downe on the right fide of the session house: and the o∣ther heads of the tenne right ouer against them on the left side. In like manner doe the olde and new auditors place themselues in the farthest seate of the hall (which as I said, is far distant from the place of the prince) some on the right hand, & some on the left, to the ende, as it should seeme, that by this manner seating themselues, they should serue (as it were) for gards or watchmen to this great assembly, least any thing should there happen to be done vnespied or vnpunished, against the lawes or order of the Sessions. The Magistrates then being in this manner placed, there are brought before the tribu∣nall The manner of choosing their electors,of the prince 3. pots, hauing in them little bals, some of gold, & some of siluer: one of the which is placed in the middest of the Tribunall seate, and the other two at each ende one, in eyther of which there are infinite
balles of siluer, but onely thirtie of golde, but in the middle potte, there are not aboue threescore balles in all, of which sixe and thirtie are of gold, and the other foure and twentie of siluer, and the golden balles are all marked with certaine letters, which they bring forth euery sessions by lot, least otherwise there might be de∣ceit vsed. The pottes being placed, three of the yongest counsellors arise from their seats, and sit downe on the lowest place of the Tribunall, by the three pottes, euerie counsellor by a seuerall pot. This being thus done and ordered, then that ranke of citizens, whose lot commeth forth, riseth presently on either parte of the session house: for throughout the length of the hall, are placed tenne rankes of benches, in which (as I said before) the citizens sitte as pleaseth them: to two of which rankes one lot onely serueth, that is to say, to those that on ey∣ther side of the hall are opposite one to the other. This ranke then whose lotte is drawen, is called by the cryer with a high voice, which ranke, and that which respon∣deth to it on the other side of the hall, presently ariseth, and the citizens in order as they sate, go vnto those pots which the counsellors haue charge of, neere vnto the princes seate, and each of them putting in his hande ta∣keth out a ball, which if it be of siluer, hee returneth by a contrarie way to the seate whence he came: if it be of gold, hee sheweth it to the Counsellor, who hath the charge of that potte, to bee viewed if it bee of the right marke. This manner of marke was ordained, least some one otherwise might bring with him a golden ball, which holding priuily in his hande, hee might seeme to haue drawne out of the potte, and so by fraude obtaine the
place of an Elector. Hee then to whose lotte befalleth one of these golden balles, goeth straight to the middle potte, and draweth out another ball, which if it bee of filuer, hee returneth whence hee came, loosing for that time his voice of election: but if it be of gold he as∣cendeth the Tribunal, and sitteth downe on the princes side in a place appointed him. The seconde that shall haue the like lot goeth also to the same place, and like∣wise the third, & so the others vntill they be nine in all, which maketh complete the first number, who are in that ranke placed in order, without respect of any thing, saue onely of their age. Here it is not to be forgotten, that those who by this benefite of lot are made electors, are presently in a loud voyce proclaimed by the Chan∣cellor in such sorte, that the whole assembly heareth him: after which no one of his neere kinsemen or al∣lyance may by any meanes attempt this lot of making himselfe Elector: neyther may there any more then two of one family be admitted to stand for the elector∣shippe: which was with great wisedome ordained of our auncestors, to the ende that this honour of election might stretch to many families, and this publike bene∣fite be largely extended among the citizens, for of rea∣son it ought to suffice if the lot fauouringtwo of one fa∣mily make them pertakers of publique authority. But to returne from whence I haue digressed, so soone as this first number of the nine electors is complete, they The manner of the choyce of magistrates made by the Electors.go presently out of the Session house into a diuided in∣ner roome, where also is present a Secretary of the commonwealth, who relateth to the Electors those thinges that are by the lawes ordained, and what they are to obserue in their election of Magistrates. Like∣wise
hee readeth vnto them the decrees of the senate, and other lawes, by which it is defended, that the Ele∣ctors shall not by any meanes suffer themselues to bee bribed or corrupted with money, nor vse in their ele∣ction any fraude or deceipt. This being done the nine Electors are placed in seates, euery one according to his age, the eldest in the highest and worthiest place: for the Venetians will not allow among their citizens any other difference, then only of age, because from thence neuer sprang any sedition nor contention: neither is the same omitted of those gret philosophers. Aristotle (I say) in his Politiques, and Zenophon in that famous worke of his, of the institution of Cyrus King of Persia. The Ele∣ctors thus placed, there are then nine little bals throw∣en into a potte, each of them marked with his number from the first to the ninth: & in a scroll somewhat long are written the magistracies in order that are in this ses∣sion to be prouided for. The eldest of the electors first putteth in his hand into the pot, & taketh out a ball, ac∣cording to the number with which the same is marked, he hath authoritie to name what citizen hee will in the same magistracy, which is in the scroll by the said num∣ber deciphered. So is it with the second, third, & like∣wise the rest, so that euery Elector by the benefite of lot is made the pronouncer of a particular magistrate. Af∣ter that he, to whome the lot of the first magistrate hap∣peneth, hath pronounced the citizen, that to him see∣meth Sixe of the 9. voices confir∣meth the ele∣cted citizen.good, the 9. electors go to voices, of which if the elected haue 6. of his side of that number of the 9. ele∣ctors, then he is presently entituled in the magistracy, & his name recorded in the long scroll, in which are writ∣ten all those magistracies for which these sessions are
called, but if he haue fewer then sixe voices (which sel∣dome happeneth) then is there another named of the same elector, & so forward still, vntill in the end one be named, of whom sixe of the electors shal allow: the selfe same manner is obserued in the second, third, & all the rest, vntil the number of those 9. electors haue euery one in particular chosen a particular magistrate: while these things are in handling in the inner diuided roome, the other citizens in the session house keepe on their course in drawing of lots as they began, & going to the pottes accordingly, as by lot it falleth to their ranks, they draw out bals, vntill 9. others haue out of either pot drawen a golden lot. These fill vp the second row of electors, & they also (according vnto the degrees of their age) are placed in the conclaue, or diuided roome: where they find an other chancellor or secretary, who without dif∣fering one iot from the former, reciteth vnto them the decrees of the senate, which they are to obserue, & brin∣geth forth to the selfe same magistrates a scroll of the selfe same order as the other was, which was brought to the first order of electors in the conclaue: & so then the lots again are drawen of the electors, and as euery one draweth, so according to the number & order aforesaid doth each of them pronounce a particular cittizen in that magistracy, which the number of his lot assigneth him. And in like manner the other third 9. obserue the aforesaid ceremonies frō point to point: & so likewise the fourth 9. so that in all they fill vp the number of 36. citizens, for so many were the golden bals that were in the pot in the middle seat: so that of 60. citizens which drew out the first 60. golden balles 36. doe become ele∣ctors, & are diuided into 4. ranks: but the twentie foure which drew the siluer balles out of the middle pot, fru∣strated
of their hope, returne them to their seates. I know how difficill a thing it is by writing to set downe these small particularities, being so farre different from the vse of the ancient Romaines: but I had rather bee blamed for folly, then for want of diligence, for I will not willingly passe ouer the smallest thing, without ma∣king mention of it: so that none how curious soeuer, may in reason desire any more at my hands. But to re∣turne where I left, there is then in euery office, (for which that day the sessions are appointed) by the foure orders of Electors, four citizens chosen, I meane by eue∣ry particular order of electors a particular citizen, vn∣lesse it happen some one selfe man to bee named of two The choise of the competi∣tors.or three of the orders of the electors (which sometimes happeneth) but for the most part there are of euery of∣fice or Magistracie foure competitors, though in some of lesse dignitie, & marke there are onely two, of which inferior offices the two first orders of electors haue po∣wer to chuse and name the competitors, of which pri∣uiledge and iurisdiction the two later orders are frustra∣ted and depriued: but so soone as the competitors of all the offices are chosen, presently the electors are dis∣missed, neyther may they that day giue their voice more to any one, neither bee so much as present at the sessions: And then the chiefe secretarie (which honor as I said, may not be giuen to a gentleman, and yet ne∣uerthelesse is of great dignitie and sway) with a high voice pronounceth from his seate the competitors of the first magistracie, and particularly relateth who is chosen, and of what order of the electors. Neyther omitteth he which of the electors was the first author of naming him. In which place me thinkes it ought not
to bee let slippe, how that it is by law established, that the same elector (who is the author of the pronunciati∣on, The Elector becommeth surety for him whom be pro∣nounceth.and choice of any competitor) is reckened to be in manner as a suretie for him: for afterwardes hauing gone beyond his competitors, and obtained the desired office, if hee then chance to conuert to himselfe any of the publike treasure, or goods, and be thereof conuic∣ted, and withall remaine vnable to make satisfaction, then that elector by whose authority he was created & pronounced, is bound out of his owne substance to pay the same to the treasure house, The competitors of the first magistracie being then pronounced by the chiefe secretary in a high voice, presently after they are named if they be then present, euery one with his parentage, & dearest friendes and kinsfolke goeth out of the session house, into an appointed conclaue or inner roome, and there stay vntil the magistracy be determined of. Then againe after all this, the chiefe secretary admonisheth them all that they are bounde both by diuine and hu∣mane lawes, without any regard of priuate commodi∣tie, to fauour and assist him whom they shall thinke fit∣test for the honour and commodity of the common∣wealth. Then he nameth the first competitor, that is, he which was chosen of the first order of electors: for whome lottes are to be tryed. Then presently rise vp so many young men, as will serue two to euery ranke of benches. They carry in their handes certaine pottes, made and ioyned together with a maruailous kinde of artifice; the vttermost part of which is greene, and the interior white, both couered: whereinto when you put your hande, it is in your choise to let your ball fall into which of the two you please: the manner of the
pottes being so contriued, that no one of those that are present, though he behold it neuer so stedfastly, can tell into whether of the two the ball was put: they doe not this with beanes, but with certaine linnen balles, lest that otherwise by the sound of their fal there might be some coniecture made into whether of the pots the bal was let fal for our ancestors deemed it to be a thing most expedient to our commonwealth, that our iudge∣ments might bee free, and therefore they tooke great care, that the suffrages might be secrete. The yong men therefore euery one with his pots thus ioyned together go euery one to his owne bench, and offer their pottes to euery one of the citizens in order as they sitte, who shewing euery one his ball openly, putteth his hand in∣to the pot, & letteth the same fall into whether parte he listeth. If he will giue his voice in fauour, then into the inner white; if otherwise, then into the vttermost which is greene: and this order is vsed throughout all the ben∣ches, whereby it commeth to passe, that in a very small moment of time the whole assembly of citizens haue yeelded their suffrages. Then the pots are brought to the princes seate, and the balles taken out and put into two broad dishes, that is to say, those which were in the white pot, & in fauour into a white dish, & those which were in the greene pot, & in disfauour, into a greene dish. Then they are brought to the counsellors (in mid∣dest of whom the prince sitteth) to be numbred & told: the suffrages of the white dish fauouring the competi∣titor are numbred of those counsellors which sit on the right hand of the prince: the other of the contrary dish & contrary effect, are tolde by those counsellors which sit on the left hand of the prince: the publike secretaries
are present where the counsellors are, and doe presently write vp the number both of the one & the other balles that are reckoned. In the mean time while these recko∣nings are in hand, they begin their suffrages for the se∣cond competitor, which was chosen of the seconde or∣der of the electors & in like sort the suffrages are brought to the counsellors, which presently are numbred, & the secretaries register them in writing: the like order is ob∣serued for the third & fourth competitor, if there be so many. All the suffrages being reckoned vp, he that hath them most in his fauour, so that they exceede the halfe is pronounced & chosen of the chiefe secretary: at such time as the sessions being ended the councel is to be dis∣missed. But if it so fall out, that none of the competi∣tors for that magistracy haue any more then the iust halfe of the lots in his fauour, then is the whole procee∣ding held as voide, and the appointment of that office deferred to the next sessions. After that the first magistracie is in the sessions de∣termined of, then are the names pronounced of those that are elected in the second, & the competitors go in∣to the conclaue with their kindred and alliance, & those that were shut in before (that is to say, the kindred and allyance of the first competitors) returne into the sessi∣ons: and the very like order and manner as in the first do they obserue in their suffrages for the competitors of the second magistracie: which being numbred by the counsellors hee is helde for elected, that exceedeth the rest in number of voyces, so that they exceede the halfe. The Sessions being ended, the names of the elected are pronounced by the chiefe Secretarie, and then the whole Councell is dismissed: which may
The councell may not be prolonged af∣ter the setting of the Sunne. not at all bee helde or prolonged after the sunne is once downe: so if in that day they make not an ende of all, then do they declare the names of those that are already chosen: and as for those that remaine, there is no rec∣koning to bee made at all: so that they remaine fru∣strate of the benefite which the nomination of the Ele∣ctors had put them in hope of. And this was so orday∣ned not without great reason, for if the matter shoulde haue beene prolonged within night, it would not haue beene easie for those magistrates that are Presidentes of the sessions, to containe so great a multitude of citizens in order, but that through fauor of the darkenesse, they woulde haue attempted somewhat preiudiciall to the lawes. Therefore our graue auncestors, men indeede wise & prouident, preuenting the inconueniences that thereby might happen with exceeding carefulnesse and wisedome, ordained that the sessions shoulde not by a∣ny meanes be continued after the setting of the Sunne; neither would that by any meanes that light should bee brought into the hall while the sessions endured. This is the whole manner of the proceeding in the sessions: but by the way it is to be noted, that the offices are so di∣stributed among the citizens, that two of one family, kindred, or neere alliance, may not by any meanes haue Two of one, kindred on fa∣mily may not haue place in office, nor bee Electors.place in one and the same office; neither in the sessions may two of one family, or neere alliance be by benefite of lotte electors (as I said before) the same likewise be∣ing ordained with great reason and discretion, to the end that the preheminence of publike authoritie might pertaine to many, and not bee engrossed vp among a few: least thereby through too much greatnesse of power might become disturbers or oppressors of the
commonwealth: and on the other side, those that doe find themselues voide and hopelesse of honour and go∣uernment, might grow into a dislike and hatred of the same. The dange∣rous estate of that gouern∣ment, which many of the citizens doe seeke to alter & vndermine. And without doubt it is almost impossible for that commonwealth to maintaine it selfe afoot, and to stand firme, whose gouernment many of the citizens do seek to alter or vndermine: so that nothing is more proper to a commonwealth, then that the common authority and power should belong to many: for it is iust that the citizens, by whom the state of the Cittie is maintained, being otherwise among themselues equall, should not in this distribution of honours bee made vnequall. But they that do reduce the publike authority into a few fa∣milies, doe easily fall vppon that estate of gouernment, which the Greeks call Oligarchia. Therefore in the com∣monwealth of Venice, the offices are so diuided among the citizens, that inso much as may be, euery family & kindred may be pertaker of the publike honors and of∣fices, and yet in that measure, that not euery one do go∣uerne, but those onely that doe excell the rest in hone∣stie and wisedome, and are deemed to be such men, as will more regard the publike, then the priuate common∣ditie. That first institution hath I know not what of po∣pular, but the other sauoureth only of the gouernment of the Nobilitie: whereby it is manifest that there is in this cittie of ours an excellent contriued mixture of the best and iustest gouernments: for though vpon the first viewe this great councell of ours seeme to beare the shew of a popular estate, yet looking well into it, you shall find therein an apparant entermixture of the go∣uernment or the nobility. I grant that the election of
The commō∣wealth of Ve∣nice is neither a popular e∣state, nor an Olygarchy, but a wel tem∣pered gouern∣ment be∣tweene both. magistrates by lot is a matter popular, especially where right and iustice is measured, not by a determinate pru∣dence, but simply by an arithmetical equality: for consi∣dering (say they) that euery one is a cittizen & freeman, one as well as another, and that among equalles things ought equally to bee diuided, euery one ought to bee sweetned alike with participation of the honours and commodities of the commonwealth, without more exclusion of one more then another: now in regarde that all cannot rule at once, but by turnes, they thinke fit that the matter should be committed meerely to lot, & that they should rule, to whome the same should bee fauourable. The contrary is alleadged by those, where full power & authority consisteth in the mightinesse of a few, for they suppose vnequall thinges to belong to vnequall persons, and that therefore mean men should content themselues with a meane & honorlesse estate, & that the great and highest dignities should belong to them that do farthest exceed the rest in riches: in which reckoning eyther of both parties strayeth far wide from the true & perfect path, though eyther of them relyeth vpon a reason in apparance seeming true, for wheras the one affirmeth equall thinges to belong to equall per∣sons, & the other that men vnequal in riches should be vnequall in gouernment: the first measuring the equa∣lity & likenes only by number, & the other the vnlike∣linesse and imparitie onely by riches, they are without doubt both of them besides the cushion: For they that are in number equall, are in some sort equall, but not wholly, & those that are in riches vnequall, though in some sort vnequall, yet are they not wholly to bee ac∣counted vnequall: but the institution of a ciuill life ten∣ding
chiefly to liue wel, it is only vertue that must make this difference. To those then that do excell the rest in vertue, the chiefest honors are due, as being most wor∣thy, & aboue the equalitie of the rest, and so likewise e∣quall rule and dignitie belongeth to those that are in vertue equall, and in ciuill industry: and this is the true measure & perfect rule to distinguish men. As therefore the choise of electors by lot is popular: so doeth it also sauor of a noble & better gouernment, that they should bee chiefliest aduanced in honor, that do chiefliest sur∣mount the rest in vertue, iudgement, and counsell, and that the vnworthier should receiue the repulse. Where∣by you may plainly perceiue, that in this manner of our gouernment there is mingled with a popular shew, the forme of a nobler rule, yet vsed with such temperature, that the same doth not exceed, nor go beyond the mean & manner of the popular authority. For in choice of the electors onely chance ruleth; of which dignitie the worst and basest may without hurt or detriment of the commonwealth, be partakers in equall power with the best & worthiest citizens, but in the essentiall distribu∣tion of honors and dignities chaunce hath no power at all, the same being wholly done by a deliberate election & aduised iudgement. And here me thinketh, I ought not to ouerslip in silence, that in those sessions, which do concerne the bestowing of offices, to which men of the greatest wisedome, honesty & diligence are requi∣red, the senate of it selfe maketh vp a fift order, to the 4. The senate when any principall of∣fice is to be prouided for, hath authori∣ty to create a fift compe∣titor.before expressed orders of electors. For whiles the o∣ther electors seperated in conclaues or places appointed for that purpose, do pronounce such to be competitors, as they shal in their iudgements think meet, thē if so be the sessions do concerne any such especial office, as be∣foresaid, the senate doth also withdraw it selfe into an
inner chamber, and there euery Senator hath power to name such one as he shall please in the office, of which the present question is: and whosoeuer shall chance to haue most voyces in his fauour, is elected in this cabi∣net of the Senate, and created the fift Competitor: whereby it plainely appeareth, that in this common∣wealth of ours the forme of an Aristocracie is much more excellent then the popular gouernment. But the manner and meanes of this kind of councell is hitherto (vnlesse I be deceiued) of vs sufficiently expressed and made plaine. Let vs now come to that part of the com∣monwealth, the which not vnlike to a well tuned dya∣pason in musicke, where the base is to the treble aptly proportioned, carrying with it the shew of a Monar∣chie, hath notwithstanding a correspondency with the popular gouernment, and finally a middle sort of Magistrates being betweene them both interposed, doth grow (as it were) into a wel concenting harmony of an excellent com∣monwealth. The end of the first booke.
The Second Booke of Venetian Commonwealth and Magistrates. THe exterior shew of the prince in the Cittie of Venice deliuereth to the eyes of the beholders the per∣son of a king, and the very resem∣blance of a monarchie: Therefore it shal not in my opinion do amisse if hauing described that assembly of citizens, which representeth the forme of a popular estate (though for the dignity of the matter vnsuffici∣ently, yet considering the slendernesse of our forces not altogether vndiligently) if we now take vpon vs to ex∣presse the first reason that moued our wise & vertuous auncestors to place one man onely at the helme of their commonwealth, and also when and what was the be∣ginning of this royall and princely institution. No man (I suppose) is ignorant of that which is so often of vs in this worke repeated, which is, that a Cittie is a certaine ciuill societie, sufficing within it selfe of such thinges as are necessarie to the leading of a happie and quiet life: and there is no question to be made, but that euery ci∣uill societie is contained and linked together in a cer∣taine vnitie, and by distraction and breach of that vnity is againe as easily dissolued. For nothing hath sooner ouerthrowne the mightie and opulent estate of many
great & glorious citties that hereto fore haue perished, then homebred discord and ciuill dissention. Now a vnitie cannot well be contayned, vnlesse one being pla∣ced in authoritie aboue, not onely the vulgar multi∣tude, but also all the rest of the citizens and officers, haue authoritie to combine them together, being scat∣tered & disioynted, and to bind them (as it were) all in∣to one entire body: which the great philosophers that were the searchers out, and (as it were) diuers into the secretes of Nature, did notably marke and obserue, as well in the constitution of the whole worlde, as also of this Microcosme or little worlde, which is Man. For they well founde out, that in this vniuersitie of thinges the many and disagreeing motions of each particular thing, according to the nature thereof, were all vpheld and maintayned vnder one heauenly and eternall mo∣uer, and so likewise all causes vnder one, the first cause of all things: and as in a liuing creature there are many and diuers members, whose functions are sundrie and different: yet neuerthelesse are all comprised vnder one onely life & member, which is the hart, and are by the same (as it were) gathered & held in a vnity: so like∣wise if the multitude be not so ordered & digested, that it may acknowledge one head and superior, in whose heart shal rest principallie engraued, an especiall care to conserue the common good, & the perfection of ciuill agreement (whereunto the actions as well of euery pri∣uate citizen, as publike magistrate, as to the last chiefe & principal end ought to be directed) surely the same can∣not long time continue, but drawing diuers waies must needs fal to decay & ruine: for if the charge of the com∣mon good be not principally to some one committed,
of necessity the too intentiue care that euery one will haue of the particular office wherein hee is imployed, must needs turne to the common hinderance: as for example: The officers for prouision of corne wil cause out of all parts great quantities to be brought to the ci∣tie, procuring onely the cheapenes and plenty thereof, which perchance woulde not proue so profitable to the publike tolles. The officers likewise of the nauie and sea matters (which are among vs of great estimation & credit) would industriate themselues peraduenture too much thereabout, in building great numbers of gallies, in gloriously adorning thē with all sorts of cost & war∣like instruments, spending therin whatsoeuer of the cō∣mon treasure they could get into their fingers, through which ouer costly diligence, the rest of the publike re∣ceipts wold hardly suffice to repair castels, & wals of to∣wers, to pay garrisons, & to defray other publike char∣ges. By which meanes the commonwealth not cohe∣ring wel together, might easily sustain detriment, not by the faultines, but by the too much carefulnes of the citi∣zens, whilest euery one endeuoureth to set forth & dis∣charge his office in the notablest maner he may: where∣by it seemeth exceeding necessary, that the care of the publike weale should be committed to some one, who being free from any priuate office, might onely mode∣rat & direct the endeuors of the rest to the cōmon good & vtility of all, which authority to be cōmitted equally to many, were very inconuenient: for as Aristotle sayth, that which many haue charge alike of, all do in a maner alike neglect: neither if ther be any thing amisse, can the blame therof be imputed more to one then to another: withall there neuer want most dangerous emulations
among those that are alike equall in authoritie. Now if one in this case should bee preferred and aduanced a∣boue the rest, in dignitie and rule with a limitation of time, and not for tear me of his life, he then would ima∣gine that he had sufficiently discharged his duety, if it went well with the commonwealth during his time of gouernment, carelesse altogether what should become thereof afterward: so that commonly many dangerous afterclappes ensue such reckonings, which by certaine and manifest experience may easily bee proued by the example of many commonwealthes, that in these times of ours haue beene ruinated through such manner of gouernment. This Monarchall gouernment was therefore esta∣blished in this commonwealth of ours with singular wisedome and iudgement, and withall the same so cur∣bed & restrained with lawes, that all dangerous incon∣ueniences, whereby the commonwealth might sustain harme, are thereby remoued, and those commodities joyntly embrased that proceed from a kingly and royal gouernment: so that there seemeth nothing to remaine which we could wish for, hauing a commonwealth vn∣enthralled, enioying a true libertie and freedome, and yet neuerthelesse as it were a king for our gouernor. A prince therefore is chosen, who is entituled with the dignitie of a Duke, retayning the gouernment of the commonwealth while the time of his life endureth, and chiefly and aboue all other thinges, hauing care of the common good and generall vtilitie, by which as I proued before (and that as I thinke with sufficient rea∣sons) cities are preserued and maintained. This Duke of ours hath not any certaine priuate of∣fice
alotted him, yet neuertheles ther is not in the whole The dignity & authority of the Duke.commonwealth any thing done, but he must be made acquainted therewith, and haue knowledge of the same. He is to containe and keep vnder in their duetie, as well euery priuate man as euery particular magi∣strate, and with such moderation to direct them, that euery thing may with an excellent harmony seeme to tune to the common good & ciuil vnion: lest any other∣wise through too much diligence, or too much negli∣gence in his office, might chaunce to hinder the com∣mon profite. This therefore is the office of the prince, that being (as it were) placed in a glasse, hee might be∣hold what euery one doth, especially those that are in authority, of whom if he find any faulty in his office, if the matter bee light, hee calleth him before the whole colledge, and there sharpely rebuketh him with words: if his offence be of greater qualitie, he causeth the same to be enquired of and examined before the aduocators and the presidents of the tenne, and to be punished ac∣cording to the sentence of the councell. The Duke him∣selfe also if he will, may vse the authority eyther of an Aduocator or President, and make report to the coun∣cell of any offence, and of any amercement or punish∣ment that is thereupon to be inflicted: (wherein what manner and custome is wont to be obserued, shall bee hereafter expressed, when wee shall come to speake of criminall iudgements.) For so great is the princes au∣thoritie, that he may in whatsoeuer court adioine him∣selfe to the Magistrate therein, being president as his colleague or companion, and haue equall power with the other Presidents, that he might so by this meanes be able to looke into all things.
Yet neuertheles so is this authoritie of his by lawes re∣tracted, that alone hee may not doe any thing, neither being ioyned to the other magistrates hath he any far∣ther power then euery other president in his office. The authoritie of the magistrates being so small, that no one of them how great soeuer he bee can determine of any thing of waight or moment without the opinion of the Councell. But of this in his place we will speake more plainely. Besides this the prince hath in euery councell equall authoritie with any of them for one suffrage or lotte. Likewise in the great counsell, and assembly of all the citizens, while the sessions are held concerning magi∣strates, hee hath no power to yeelde more fauour to a competitor of his kindred or parentage, then to any o∣ther: obseruing the same equall priuledge which the o∣ther citizens doe: whereby I thinke any man may ea∣sily vnderstand, that the Duke of Venice is depriued of all meanes, whereby he might abuse his authoritie, or become a tyrant▪ which ancient & long continued cu∣stome from the first beginnings of the citie, euē to these times, hath now taken such foundation and roote, that there is nothing whereof the citie of Venice need stand lesse in feare, thē that their prince should at any time be able to inuade their liberty, or trouble their common quiet. But now least euery one should refuse this dig∣nitie; requiring so great paines & continuall solicitude of mind, vnlesse there should thereunto bee adioyned some sweetnes or reward: this limitation of authoritie is on the other side recompensed with an exterior princely honor, dignitie, & royall appearing shew: for the ornamentes of his bodie are kingly, vsing alwaies
purple garments or cloth of gold. On his head he wea∣reth in stead of a diadem, a vaile of linnē, vpon the same a hood or miter of purple, garnished about with a fringe of golde, the part whereof that couereth the middle or hinder parte of the head riseth vp in forme of a horne. His seat is somewhat higher then the rest, and in estate kingly. All the citizens, as well those that beare rule and office, as those that are priuate men speake vnto him bareheaded and standing, which in these times is a signe of exceeding honor. The prince neuer riseth vp to any person. All the letters of the commonwealth are sealed, and go forth vnder his name. What prince, em∣bassador, Magistrate, Captaine, or whosoeuer els that writeth to the senate, directeth his letters to the prince. The proclamations of lawes, orders, & decrees, all are done vnder his name. All their money, as well gold as siluer is coyned and stamped with his name & picture. Finally to shorten my speech, in euery thing you may see the shewe of a king, but his authority in nothing, which without doubt whosoeuer is wise cannot but confesse to haue beene ordained by the Venetian com∣monwealth with exceeding prudence and wisedome: because otherwise without this rewarde of honour, the office of the prince would haue been reputed as burthe∣nous & vnpleasing, but that the reward, which is honor following, sweetneth the same, according to the opiniō of great philosophers: so that Aristotle saith in his Ethikes seeing those that do rightly & holily performe their of∣fice in gouernment, haue more respect to the profite of other men, then their owne: there cannot by any other meanes be returned vnto them a due and equiua∣lent recompence, but onely by making them to exceed all the rest in honor and dignity. Moreouer the dignity
of this prince causeth all the other citizens exceedingly to feare his reprehension, and performe the offices in which they are placed, with the greater fidelity & care. There are to the prince adioyned sixe counsellors of Sixe counsel∣lors chosen out of sixe quarters of the citie.sixe tribes, into which the Citie is diuided, euery tribe chusing one. Their office continueth eight monethes, & they are continually at the princes elbow: nothing is said vnto the prince but they do heare it: no letters are sent forth but such as shall seeme good and alowable to foure of those counsellors, who also doe in the letters subscribe their names; yet not in those letters which are sent forth, but in those which are first written by the secretaries of the commōwealth, which are reserued, & the coppies of them sent forth. In which also it is to be noted, that those letters which are sent, not by the de∣cree of the councell, but by the commandement of the Prince and Counsellors, as they neuer contain but mat∣ters of small importance, so are they of small authority. For as wee haue often saide, all authoritie and power is onely to bee attributed to the councell, no one magi∣strate hauing of himselfe any ample authoritie. But of the counsellors we will speake more hereafter: now I will returne to the prince or Duke. The Prince therefore being honored with this king∣ly apparance and shewe, because oftentimes it fell out that priuate wealth suffised not to maintayne so great dignity and pompe: there is allowed vnto the Duke out of the common treasure yearely, three thou∣sand and fiue hundred crownes of gold: and to the end least some one couetous of increasing his substance, should neglect the honour & dignitie of the common∣wealth, & conuert that money to his priuate vse, there
are certaine charges imposed vpon him, which at his owne cost he must see defrayed, with an especiall care of the seruice & dignity of the commonwealth: which if through auarice or sparing of money he neglect, there is so great a fine and amercement set vpon the heade of his heires, that whiles by increasing his priuate wealth, and dispensing with his honour and dignity, hee shall think to enrich them, he shall in a manner vtterly vndoo them: besides the leauing of an eternall blot and ig∣nominy to his posteritie. He maintayneth of his owne charge many seruants, or as you would say of his guard, but yet such as weare no weapons. Hee alwaies vseth costly garments: he dwelleth in a pallace wonderfully adorned with goodly chambers and tapistry, aboun∣ding with vessels of siluer and all other such furniture, as is beseeming the degree of a prince. Foure times a yeare he maketh a solemne and sumptuous banket, to Foure times a yeare the Duke ban∣ketteth the citizens.aboue threescore citizens, the same being ordered and set forth with all the magnificency that may be. Wher. in our predecessors brought into our commonwealth the auncient order of the inhabitantes of Lacedemon and Crete (whose commonwealthes were noble and glori∣ous) but with a much better moderation and order: for they because they thought the often meeting of the ci∣tizens was a mean to combine them together in friend∣ship, instituted certaine publike feastes at the charge of the common treasure, to which the citizens assembling had meanes one to be acquainted with the other, and withal by so friendly a meeting to confirm a new friend ship. But seeing that they all went confusedly toge∣ther, those assemblies could not be without troubles & tumultes, and besides when those that were to feast &
banket the rest, did desire to do it with daintinesse, and magnificence, there could not but ensue a great wast of the common treasure. Therefore with a certain amend∣ment & moderation is that ancient manner brought in vse among the Venetians, and the whole care and or∣dering thereof committed to the prince. Foure times a yeare therfore are the citizens banqueted of the prince, with fare truely honorable and daintie, and yet for the exceedingnesse thereof not to be enuied: neyther doth euery one come vnorderly as it pleaseth him, but those whome the prince shall vouchsafe to call: vnlesse it bee the Counsellors, the Aduocators, the Presidents of the xl. men, & the Presidents of the tennes, who in prehe∣minence of their offices, are vsually present at the princes bankets: the other citizens come not but in∣uited. These foure feastings are in this sort diuided, that the elder and worthiest citizens being inuited, doe in the winter time vpon S. Stephens day assemble themselues in the publike pallace appointed for the princes habitati∣on, and with a solemne pompe waite vpon the prince from thence to the church of S. Marke, and there bee present with him at Masse, which being ended, then they waite vppon him backe to his house againe, and there be pertakers of his banquet. Likewise in the mo∣neth of Aprill on the day of Saint Marke (whose me∣mory is with exceeding honour solemnized of the Ve∣netians, as entituling him their patron and defender, e∣uer since the reliques of his body were brought vnto Venice, from forth of Alexandria a noble Citie of Aegypt) the cittizens of lesse age and dignitie inuited of the prince, doe in like manner (after the solemnities in the
church are ended) conuay him home and dine with him. Thirdly, vppon Ascention day, being the day of the great fayer at Venice, they are inuited and admitted to the Princes banket, that are fully arriued and entred into that age which we call Virilis or mans estate. These also doe early in the morning waite vpon the Duke from his house, and go aborde a ship gorgeously trim∣med and set forth, reserued onely to that vse, and is by the Venetians called Bucentoro: so soone as they are passed the marishes and come to behold the plaine and open sea, by an ancient indulgence of the high Bishops (who honoured this commonwealth of ours, in regard of many notable exploites by it atchieued against the The Dake of Venice mari∣eth the sea with a ring of gold.enemies of the Christian faith) the prince throwing a ring of golde into the sea, vseth in a manner these speaches, that with that ring hee doeth betroth him∣selfe to the sea, in token of a true and perpetuall Em∣pyre. To this there are added certayne ceremonies by the Patriarch of the Cittie, which being ended, they lande at the Church dedicated to Saynt Nicholaus, a thing of great antiquitie, built vppon that shore or banke which diuideth the sea from the lakes. There the holy misteries are celebrated, which being ended, they go aborde the ship againe, and returne to Venice, attending on the Prince home to his house, where they dyne with him. The fourth and last banquette pertayneth to the young cittizens, who the twelue Kalendes of Iuly, on the day dedicated to the two Martyres Vi∣tus and Modestus, doe with solemne pompe wayte vpon the Prince to the Temple of those Martirs, which
is situate neere to the great channell that diuideth the cittie in the middest: which channell is for that tyme conioyned with a bridge made vpon two galleyes, least otherwise to make that iourney, would cost a very long and laboursome circuit and compasse. The church be∣ing visited, and the solemnities in the church finished, they attend vpon the prince home to his pallace, where they are receiued with a royall & magnificent banket. There are to these bankets admitted dauncers, iesters, and excellent singers, to recreate & delight the guestes, and withal certaine sports and playes are intermingled, which doe moue exceeding mirth and pleasure: and this ancient custome is still obserued in the common∣wealth of Venice, though somewhat moderated. For by this means the citizens in a manner of euery degree, yea equals with equalles are entertayned at the princes table: which seemeth exceedingly well ordered and disposed, as well for the dignity of the prince, as also for nourishing & maintayning loue and good will among the citizens. But because euery citizen that is a gentle∣man, cannot euery yeare receiue this grace of being in∣uited, it is by an olde law ordained, least any one should seeme to be left out, that the prince should in the win∣ter time sende to euery citizen that hath priuiledge of A strange ce∣remony obser∣ued by the Duke of Ve∣nice, but now the same is al∣tered, & the wild ducks changed into a peece of sil∣uer coyne.voyce in the greater Councell fiue wild duckes, as a portion or share of the publike banket, which likewise is a great meane to the Duke of winning the loue and goodwill of the citizens. In these chargeable expences doth the Duke yeare∣ly consume and spend a great part of that money which hee receiueth out of the common treasure: so that though the Duke would be couetous, yet cannot hee
in a manner staine with any basenesse the noblenesse & dignity of the place he holdeth. Here because the whole power and authority of the prince is in a manner already expressed of vs, it shal not be amisse to declare in what season and time the begin∣ning was of creating a Duke in Venice, and finally what is the order of the sessions in his election. The begin∣ning of crea∣ting a Duke in Venice. Immediately from the first beginning of the Cittie, when the noblest citizens of the Venetian prouince, (their greatest citties, as Aquileia, Altina, Concordia, Vderzo, Padoua, and many other of great opulencie and richesse, being ruinated by the Hunnes, vnder the con∣duct of Attyla their Captaine, who filled Italy with fire and blood) did assemble themselues in those flattes of the Adriatique sea, where Venice since was builded, & euery one of them had chosen for his mansion those places which were nearest to the country which hee had abandoned: it came to passe that there were by them built about two and twentie townes, partly vpon that shore or bank which encloseth the inner lakes, part∣ly vppon certaine hillockes which appeared out aboue the lakes. But in the beginning when those townes were neither of themselues sufficiently fortified and fenced, neither euery of them so furnished with shipping, that it was able to resist the incursions of theeues and pirates, they thought it meete (seeing their fortunes were all a∣like) to gouerne their matters by a common councell, as well for the prouision of corne, wine, fruites, and o∣ther necessaries, as also the securitie of their persons and families, thereby to auoide the daunger of pyrates and rouers, to which in regarde of their weake, scattered & vnfortified townes, they lay in a manner open. There∣fore
when firsteuery towne had chosen from out his o∣ther citizens a chiefe and sufficient man, calling him by Euery towne did chuse a Tribune.the name or title of Tribune, they generally altogether ordained, that vpon certain appointed daies these Tri∣bunes should meete, and consult together the common businesse: but finding in the end an inconuenience in the varietie of so many opinions and authorities, and suffring withal many incommodities, they thought no∣thing would doe better then to lay the whole charge of the generall and common affaires vppon some one particular man, whom all the rest should acknowledge as their prince and ruler. It was therefore by generall consent of the xxij. townes concluded and agreed, that The princes seate assigned him in the towne of He∣raclea.there should one Duke or Prince be chosen, & his seate assigned him at the beginning, in the towne of Hera∣clea, situated on the inner side of the lakes, in a certaine Ilande neere to the mouth of the riuer Piaue, which in our time (by inundation of the flouds) is now ioyned to the firme lands, But afterwards this place seeming vn∣fit, because it was farre off, so that many times afore the prince could haue aduertisement, the Pyrates had alrea∣dy entred the lakes, oppressed at vnwares the inhabi∣tants, & spoiled their shipping. Therefore they thought The princes seat transpo∣sed to Mala∣moco.it better that the prince leauing Heraclea shoulde plant his seat in Malamoco, a towne seated vpon the midst of the banke: whence the Duke might easily & soon haue inckling of any whatsoeuer attempt of the Pyrates, and Pipin inuaded Italy.with small adoo bee at hand wheresoeuer his presence The princes seat lastly re∣duced to Ve∣nice.should be requisit. But at length when Pipin (euen in those very beginnings of the Venetian citie) threatned seruitude & slaughter, & they abandoning (in a maner) the rest of the townes, they came altogether to Rialta,
thither also was the seate of the prince translated, by which meanes Venice in time encreased, and grew into that greatnesse in which we now do see it: so that by a perpetuall continuing custome, euen from the begin∣ning, there alwayes was a prince and gouernour of the Venetian commonwealth. At first for a while their au∣thority was greater: but afterwardes being by vse of time and experience taught, they began with holesome statutes and lawes to abridge his power, bringing it by degrees into this temperature, in which wee now doe see it. The manner of choosing the Duke of Venice. The manner of chusing a successor to the deceased Duke, was at the first altogether simple, and without ceremony: for our auncestors being men of great soundnesse and integritie, & free from all ambition, did euery one in his particular, draw backe from accepting a matter of so great a charge: so that by a generall crie & acclamation of the people, he was proclaimed prince that was reputed to be the honestest & wisest man: But after those times, the Citie and people increasing to a greater mightinesse & state, it seemed a thing not con∣uenient to the greatnes of so noble a cōmonwealth, to commit to the rash & wauering voice of the multitude, a matter of so great waight, honor, and dignity. It was therfore decreed, that there should be chosen out 11. of the most sufficient citizens, & that this authority of cre∣ating the prince shold be wholy vnto thē cōmitted: but afterwards as with their empire their ambitiō increased, there were appointed certain seueral parliaments or ses∣sions, & a kind of intricate way found out in this electi∣on of the Duke, which (least there should be any thing wanting in my vndertaken taske) I wil briefly expresse.
The Duke being deade, and his obsequies deuoutly and honourably solemnized: the Counsellors, who presently vpon the princes death during the interregne or vacancy, betaking themselues to the publike pallace, appointed for the princes habitation, do call & assemble The Dukes actions exa∣mined after his death.together the great councell. In that first assemblie after the Dukes decease, there are (according to the maner of the sessions before expressed) 5. citizens created, whose office is diligently to looke into & to examine the acti∣ons of the deceased prince, and if they found any thing done by him against the lawes and statutes, then by o∣pinion and authoritie of the councell to cancel and dis∣anull the same. If he haue receiued a bribe of any man, or haue been sparing in that due and ordinary expence which belongeth to his dignitie, then vpon the report of these fiue cōmissioners, there is such a fine and amer∣cement imposed vpō his heires, as the lawes command: the penaltie is onely money, which is leuied vpon the Princes inheritance, & caried into the treasure house. In the same session are likewise chosen fiue other citi∣zens, who immediatly vppon their election doe retire themselues into an aparted roome, or conclaue adioy∣ned to the session house, out of which they doe not de∣part, till after many matters well debated, they doe at length determine whether there is any thing that in their opinion ought to be taken away, or added to the princes authoritie. The matter being well discussed a∣mong them, the councel is called together again, which being done, they then come forth of the conclaue (for before they may not) and euery of them declareth his opinion to the Councell concerning the authority of the prince, and then it being of the whole assembly to∣gether
aduised on: it is by suffrages decreed which shal be most for good of the commonwealth. And that de∣cree is presently registred among the lawes, which the following Prince is bound to obserue. The authority and power of the prince being once setled and deter∣mined: the next day after is spent in that intricate kinde of sessions, in which the Prince is accustomed to bee chosen. No citizen al∣lowed in those sessions which concerne the election of their prince, vnder the age of 30▪ yeares. All the citizens that are aboue thirtie yeare olde do assemble and meet together: for no one vnder that age is by an auncient institution of the commonwealth ad∣mitted into that Councell or sessions: then the citizens are all of them numbred, and so many as they are in number, so many little balles are throwen into a potte, of which thirtie are golde, and the rest siluer: The pot is placed iust before the tribunal of the sessions, where the Counsellors do stand: and by the same stan∣deth a little boy which pulleth out the lottes. The citi∣zens are called and doe come vnto the potte euery one according vnto the ranke and order in which he sitteth, but no one is suffred, (as in their other sessions the cu∣stome is) to put his hand into the potte, onely the boy which standeth by, draweth out for each of them his ball. Those that chaunce vpon a siluer ball, do present∣ly depart forth of the sessions: but hee whome fortune shal fauor with one of those that are of gold, is presently in a high voice published and pronounced by the secre∣tary: and immediately goeth his waies apart into the inner roome, and all his kindred and neere allies doe presently arise out of their places, and all go together in∣to one part or corner of the hall. There they are num∣bred, and so many as they are, so many siluer balles are
30. chosen out of the whole multitude. drawen out of the potte and giuen them, vpon which without delay, they depart out of the hall: so that one∣ly thirtie, to whose lot the golden balles do befall, are chosen and elected out of the whole assembly of citi∣zens: and that being done, the councell is dismissed. These 30. re∣duced to 9.After they are all departed, those thirtie come again out of the conclaue, & trie once more their chaunce by lot∣tery afore the Counsellors, so that of their number one∣ly nine, whom this new lottery shall fauour, are made Electors: and the rest being dismissed, they go againe into a closet appointed for the purpose, and there are locked in alone, no one, no not a seruant suffred to The 9. chuse 40.speake with them: nor they may not thence depart till they haue chosen fortie men, of which fortie no one can of them be declared as elected and chosen, vnlesse he haue first sixe balles or suffrages in his fauour: so that if there bee foure of the nine contrary to him, hee may not be elected. So soone as they are once agreede in the choise of these fortie men, they sende word there∣of vnto the Counsellors by the publique guardian or Porter: presently the Counsellors (vnlesse the day bee very farre spent) doe call and assemble the great coun∣cell: which being altogether in the Court, there is a list brought out of the closet, wherein the names are written of the Electors: and then the chiefe Secretary ascending the Tribunall, doth with a high voyce pro∣nounce the names of the fortie elected cittizens: of which euery one as he heareth himselfe named, doeth arise from his seate, and going to the Tribunall of the Counsellors, doeth there sitte downe, and then go∣eth thence into an appointed closet or inner roome: but if any one chaunce to be away, he is presently en∣quired
for by the Counsellors, and the Presidentes of the fortie, and sought for with great diligence through∣out the cittie. So soone as hee is founde out, hee is immediatly by those Magistrates brought into the sessi∣ons, and thence into the Conclaue to his fellowes, without suffring him to speake or talke with any man by the way: thereby to exclude all ambition and su∣bornation out of the sessions, which the will of our auncestors was, shoulde be handled with all vpright∣nesse and sinceritie. By this meanes the fortie de∣signed cittizens doe come together vnawares, and be∣ing come together, the Councell is presently dismis∣sed. Then these fortie doe come forth agayne out of the closet into a large and open hall before the coun∣sellors, and there by the same manner of lotterie as is The 40. redu∣ced to 12.before expressed, twelue of the fortie are chosen, and the other eyght and twentie which remaine, are put backe and forsaken. These twelue agayne doe chuse The twelue chuse 25.fiue and twentie others, of which euery one must haue eyght suffrages, for vnder none may be chosen: which being ended and done, they presently sende worde thereof by a messenger to the Counsellors. They, if the season of the day serue, doe call and assemble the Councell, and (in a manner) as before those fiue and twentie also vnawares are assembled and gathered to∣gether, The 25. redu∣ced to nine.and then the Councell being dismissed, nine of them are by the same sort of lottery as before, elected, the rest do go their wayes. These nine elect fortie fiue other citizens, but no one of them, vnlesse he haue 6. of The nine do elect 45.the nine suffrages, which in the councell in like manner againe assembled are pronounced of the Secretarie,
The 45. redu∣ced to 11. and so put into the closet. These by the like manner of The 11. doe e∣lect 41. who haue authori∣tie to choose the Duke.lottery are reduced vnto eleuen, who doe chuse one & fortie of the chiefe and noblest Senators, who so soone as they are pronounced, doe presently withdraw them∣selues into a seuerall appointed roome: and these haue authoritie to elect the Duke: but so that there may not be by any meanes two of a kindred in the number of electors, which is among the Venetians a perpetuall custome in all their offices. Our ancestors (being men most wise and vertuous) The cause of this intricate proceeding in the Dukes e∣lection.made choise of this strange and intricate proceeding, to the ende the whole multitude might seeme to haue a part in this creation & election of their prince. For the electors of the first order are made by lotte, of which all the citizens are capable: next which they mingled e∣lection, but in sort that election should exceede the lot∣terie: because no man may receiue any fauour by the benefite of lottes, vnlesse the same bee allowed and ap∣proued of the first order: but in the next order they would not that chaunce or lot should haue any force at all: because they thought it vnfit and full of inconueni∣ences, to commit the choice of those that were to be e∣lectors of their prince, to the temerity and arbiterment of fortune: in sort that neyther is the multitude wholly depriued of this authority, neyther yet is the same com∣mitted to the wauering witte of the inconsiderate peo∣ple, among whom commonly a vaine opinion and vn∣grounded fauour may doe more, then a setled iudge∣ment of those that are wise and vertuous. Besides, the not knowing who they are that are to be electors of the prince, but the determination of the whole depending vpon those that are fortunate in their lottes: all aspiring
pretensions and ambitions, are thereby clearely cut off and taken away: because it may easily come to passe, that those with whom there is any practise entertained, shall not haue any authoritie at all. But to returne to the matter: the manner of the sessions being in this sort accomplished, the one and fortie electors of the prince, immediately vpon their election, without salu∣ting or speaking to any man doe go into that Court, in which the senate is accustomed to assemble, where hea∣ring diuine seruice, which is celebrated with great so∣lemnity & deuotion, laying their handes vpon the aul∣tar, they do promise with oath to God, and to the com∣monwealth, that they will chuse him for their Duke, whome they shall esteeme to bee worthiest and of best desert, as well in loue towards his countrey, as in piety, carefulnesse and prudence, and then the priestes depar∣ting, they onely are enclosed & lockt within the Court alone, without so much as a seruant suffred to be among them. Then three of the eldest do sit down by at a cer∣tain table fitted for that purpose, vpon the which there standeth a pot, and euery elector writeth in a little scrol the name of him whom he thinketh fitte to bee created Duke, which scrolles being first all well medled toge∣ther, are put into the potte, of which one is taken out, such as shall by chance come into the hand of him that taketh it forth. The scroll being read, hee whose name is therein contayned, if he bee present (as for the most parte it happeneth) goeth presently out of the Court. Then if any shall thinke him to be a man vnfit, or vnca∣pable, or vnworthy of so great a dignity, or for any other cause shall not thinke his creation to bee for the
good of the commonwealth, he riseth vp, and with an honest modestie speaketh his opinion, declaring the cause why he thinketh it vnmeet that he should be cho∣sen and created Duke: when he hath ended his speech, the partie is called in againe, and the eldest in the com∣pany declareth the obiections made against him, al∣waies prouided that he neuer nameth the author there∣of: for they are all first bound by solemne oath to ob∣serue perpetuall silence. He on the other side excuseth and confuteth (in the best sort he may) the matters al∣leadged against him. After which hee auoydeth the court againe, & then if the first or any other will charge him a fresh with any other matter, it is in their libertie to doe it: and he againe being called in, hath libertie to aunswere in his iustification, and so till the matter is by turne handled, till his accusers be silent, and haue no∣thing any farther to vrge against him. Then at last go they to their lottes: Somewhat be∣fore our time if the first had had 25. suffrages in his fauour, then was there no farther reckoning made Andrea Gritti Duke of Ve∣nice.of the rest, but he was straight proclaimed for Duke: but in our time in those sessions in which Andrea Gritti (a most honourable Senator) was proclaymed Duke, this custome was altered. For although none bee ele∣cted Prince vnlesse he haue fiue and twentie suffrages: yet the matter consisteth not as before it did, in him that first obtayneth that number, but proceedeth still forward to the rest, so that if any go beyond that num∣ber; hee then is proclaymed Duke, and not the for∣mer. After the lottery is ended concerning him whose name was first drawen, then is there an other scroll taken
forth of the pot, and all things concerning the same or∣dered in euery point as the former: and so the thirde, fourth, & finally all: but if no one of the whole num∣ber haue in his fauour the complete summe of those suffrages, then if the day be not too farre spent, the ses∣sions are once againe begun in the same manner as be∣fore: and to the end that the expedition should be the greater, it is not lawfull for any of the electors to depart thence, neyther haue they liberty to speake with any stranger, till fiue and twenty of them are agreed in the election of the Duke: whom so soone as they haue na∣med and chosen, the Counsellors are presently called into the court, who first doe with all reuerence and ho∣nor salute the new prince. The fame of which presently flyeth through the citie: in euery parte whereof you may behold the citizens making ioy, and throwing vp The solemni∣ties that fol∣low the electi∣on of the prince.their prayers to heauen for this prince, that his gouern∣ment may bee fortunate and happie to the common∣wealth. All his parents and kinsefolkes come presently vnto the Court, congratulating with him, of this his great honor and dignitie: in meane while the coyners are set a worke to stampe money, with the face & name of the prince, and all thinges busily prepared that the future pompe requireth: in which season the Duke and the Counsellors doe apparell themselues, and being apparelled and in order, doe so discende out of the Court, and go directly vnto the Church of Saint Marke, being neere thereunto adioyning, a church of wonderfull goodlinesse and magnificence, and re∣splendishing in all sortes and varietie of rich ornaments and pompous architecture. They do first religiously, &
with great veneration, adore the mighty name of God, & then do all ascend vp into a high & stately seat, made all of Porphire stone, whence the eldest of the electors maketh a speech vnto the people, wherein he declareth the creation of the newe Duke, vttering withall some few wordes in a modest commendation of him. After whom the Duke also maketh an oration, in which after hauing spoken discreetly a few things concerning him∣selfe: hee there promiseth and voweth to obserue all such things as shal become a vertuous prince, with grea∣ter care of the good of the commonwealth, then of any his owne priuate commodity: chiefly that he will beare himselfe in matter of iustice most holily and strictly, with endeuour that equall right may be administred to all men, that hee will not spare his priuate substance, his labour, no nor his life: if by any incommodity of his the estate of the commonwealth might bee assisted or remedied. Finally, he humbly prayeth vnto God, vn∣to S. Marke (vnder whose patronage the Citie of Venice is) and to all the Saints, that they will be all fauourable and helpefull vnto him in the well discharging of this great and honourable office. His wordes are receiued of the people with a great applause: And at the ende therof they do all discend from off the high seat or scaf∣fold, and do place the Duke before the high altar, where laying his hand vpon the Gospell, he doth binde him∣selfe by solemne oth to God & to his commonwealth, that he will not omit the performance of any such thing as the Duke of Venice is bound vnto by the lawes. This being done, the Electors (that hitherto remained with the Duke doe all depart, he mounteth vp into a pulpit
of wood, taking with him one of his kinsemen, such as ofall other he holdeth deerest: which pulpit the ma∣riners, such as are best esteemed, doe take vppon their shoulders, and with a great shoute and ioy doe carry the Duke sitting therein throughout the whole place of S. Marke, who from out the pulpit throweth money coined in his owne name round about him. There is no certaine summe herein limited, but euen according as the substance of the Duke may beare, the same being wholly referred to his disposition and pleasure: but once, the people be not negligent in gathering it vppe. At length hauing gone about the place, when they come before the staires of the princes pallace, they there stay the pulpit, and the prince descendeth out. The apparell which the Duke weareth, and likewise a siluer potte, in which the money so throwen about a∣mong the people was kept, belongeth by an auncient custome vnto the mariners, that did so beare the Duke vpon their shoulders. The Duke mounting vp the de∣grees of the pallace, is there receiued of the Counsel∣lors, and there by them crowned with the foresaid Mi∣ter, which is as it were the Dyadem or ornament of the Prince. This is the order of the whole pompe. The day following the Senate is assembled in the Court, and the Duke maketh an oration, giuing thankes to God, & to the fathers for this aduancement and honour which he had receiued, promising withall, that his diligence & trauaile shal neuer be spared for the commonwealths commodity. The like oration hee maketh before the whole assembly of citizens in the first sessions that is held after his creation. Hauing now sufficiently spoken of the Duke or prince
of our commonwealth, it remaining that briefly wee speake somewhat concerning the Counsellors, to the end that you may vnderstand what their authority is, and how farre it extendeth. There are alwaies (as I said before) sixe Counsellors The office & authority of the 6. Coun∣sellors.present by the princes side, out of euery quarter of the citie one: for the whole citie is diuided into sixe quar∣ters or tribes: three of the which are on this side of the great channell, which diuideth the citie, and three on the other: out of each of these quarters is chosen one counsellor in the sessions, according to the manner be∣fore expressed in the choyce of other magistrates. Their office continueth onely eight monethes, in which ioint∣ly with the Prince they take care of all such affaires as pertain to the commonwealth. But the whole maner & handling of the sessions, an auncient ordinance passeth chiefly through their hands. Likewise if report is to be made vnto the great councell of any matter, and by au∣thority therof to be confirmed, they are to make report thereof, as those to whose authority that right only be∣longeth, yet somtimes the Presidents of the 40. are ad∣ioyned to thē, who otherwise were insufficient & with∣out power to make report ouer to the councell. No o∣ther magistrate (the Duke onely alwaies excepted) hath this authority. They may likewise (if it please thē) make report of any thing to the Senate or the tenne men: but the charge of assembling the Senate, and reporting to the same chiefly belongeth to the Preconsultors, like as the office of the Presidentes of the tenne is to assemble the tenne, & to make report vnto them: the manner of which shall hereafter be more largely handled. But the Councellors are endued with greater priuiledge, as
those that haue in the senate equall authority with the Preconsultors, and in the courtes of the tenne men, with the presidentes of that Court: for the space of eyght monthes they are alwaies present with the Duke: and do exercise these offices of which I haue made menti∣on. But foure monthes they are present or rather Pre∣sidentes of the fortie men, who haue the handling of waightie and capitall matters, which are by their iudge∣ment decided & determined of, as shall hereafter more plainly be declared. Now seeing that which concernes the great councell, which representeth in this common∣wealth popular estate, and that likewise of the prince, which beareth the person of a king, is handled of vs, though vneloquently, yet faithfully, & with diligence, the vndertaken worke seemeth to require at my hands, that I should likewise speake of the other partes & bran∣ches of this gouernment, which in seeming doe repre∣sent the rule & gouernment of the nobles and best citi∣zens, seeing that especially the same doth in the city of Venice excell the rest: as in the following volume I will by Gods help, make manifest and plaine. The end of the second booke.
The third Booke of the Magistrates and Commonwealth of the Venetians. EVery institution and gouernment of man, the neerer it aspireth to the praise of perfection and goodnesse, the nearer shold it imitate nature, the best mother of all thinges: for so hath she disposed the order of the whole world, that those things which are deuoide of sence and vnderstanding, shoulde bee ruled and gouerned by those that haue sence and knowledge: and therefore in this assemblie of men, (which of vs is called Citie) olde men ought to bee preferred before the younger fort, as those that are lesse subiect to the perturbations of the minde, and withall hauing beene of longer life, must needes be of greater experience in the affaires of the world. Therefore Aristotle in his Politiques most wisely saith, that in euery commonwealth which wold emulate and follow the wisedome & policie of nature, olde men should be placed at the helme, and the office of the young men should bee to obey and to execute those thinges, which the olde men should commande them. Neither can the young men, seeing this institu∣tion is nearest vnto Nature, by any meanes finde fault
or repine at the gouernment of olde men, or stirre vppe therefore any sedition in the commonwealth: seeing that in this difference which age onely maketh, enuie hath no place, neyther may there iustly bee any com∣plaint, so long as the young men shall assuredly hope to receiue the like obedience in their age, of the follow∣ing younger sort: which opinion of Aristotle is allow∣ed of all commonwealthes that euer were of any fame, who alwaies preferred the counsell of the elder sort, as The name of senate deriued from Senes signifieth olde men.well in the gouernment of their Cittie, as in the admi∣nistration of their other publike affaires, neither is the name of senate from else where deriued, then from old men, who in the Latine tong are called Senes. I woulde alleadge heere the commonwealth of the Romaines, of the Athenians, of the Carthaginians, of the Lacedemo∣nians, besides the lawes of sundry other cities, but that the matter is of it selfe so manifest, that it standeth not in need of any such proofe. With this reason therefore was the Senate ordayned and established in this commonwealth of ours, & like∣wise the councell of the tenne, who in the cittie of Ve∣nice in whose commonwealth (as I said) there is a mix∣ture of the three gouernments royall, popular, & noble, do represent the state of the nobilitie, & are (as it were) the meane or middle, which reconcileth and bindeth together the two extreames, that is, the popular estate represented in the great councell, & the prince bearing a shew of royaltie. So saith Plato are the extreame ele∣mentes, the earth and the fire, ioyned and bound toge∣ther with the middle elementes, as in a well tuned dya∣pason the extreame voyces are concorded together by the middle tunes of the Dyatessaron and Diapente.
The number of right and lawfull sena∣tors are 120. To go forward therefore with my purpose, the senate of Venice hath a hundred and twenty lawfull senators, besides many other magistrates that do also obtaine the priuiledge and right of Senators, so that now in this time of ours there are aboue two hundred and twentie that haue the authority of vsing their suffrages in the senate. The lawfull Senators are euery yeare created by that assembly of citizens, which (as I haue often repea∣ted) is tearmed the great Councell: Neyther hath this honour any vacation, as the other magistrates haue, but they may if their lot fall out, and that the great councell bee therewith pleased (which for the most parte hap∣peneth) continue euery yeare in that office. The man∣ner and meane of their election is of vs before declared, when wee expressed the forme of the whole sessions. There are in the monthes of August and September in euery session sixe Senators elected: which session be∣ing in those sessions tenne times remoued, make vp the number of threescore elected Senators, the other threescore are ioyned, or (as it were) ascribed to the former, and they all are chosen together at certain par∣ticular sessions. For vpon the nine & twentieth day of September, the senate doth assemble, & then euery sena∣tor and other that hath authority of suffrages, nameth a citizen in the Senate. And the next day early at three a clocke in the morning, the whole number of citizens commeth into the session house, and then the names being rehearsed by the Secretary of all those citizens, who the day before were named of the Senators, the names of all are put into a potte, and afterwardes taken out by chaunce. By and by they go to their lottes, of which threescore of those that shall haue most lottes in
their fauour (so that they exceed not the halfe) are that yeare ascribed in the number of Senators, but yet in that sort that there may not bee in that last number a∣boue two of a kindred: so that in the whole number of lawfull Senators, there cannot in all be aboue three of a kindred, which ordinance seemeth to haue beene established with exceeding wisedome in behalfe of the commonwealth: considering that there cannot hap∣pen to a commonwealth a more daungerous or pesti∣lent contagion, then the ouerweighing of one parte or faction aboue the other: for where the ballance of iu∣stice standeth not euen, it is vnpossible that there should bee a friendly societie and firme agreement a∣mong the citizens: which alwaies happeneth where many offices of the commonwealth meete together in one. For as euery mixture dissolueth, if any one of the elementes (of which the mixed body consisteth) ouer∣come the other: and as in musicke the tune is marred where one string keepeth a greater noyse then hee shoulde doe: so by the like reason, if you will haue your commonwealth perfect and enduring, let not one parte bee mightier then the other, but let them all (in as much as may bee) haue equall share in the publique authoritie. With excellent wisedome and prouidence therefore did our auncestors cause this to bee established as a perpetuall law and decree in our commonwealth, that not onely in the senate, but also in all other offices there shoulde not bee any more of one kindred or allyance, then the preseruation of equalitie required. Neyther seemeth the order of e∣lecting the Senate inuented with lesse forecast and pru∣dence, which is that threescore citizens should bee
chosen, according to the accustomed vse of the sessions, chaunce, election and iudgement, being therein min∣gled altogether, but that the choyce of the other three∣score should bee after another sorte, such as you haue heard, wherein chaunce hath no force at all: for if in them all chance should haue borne sway, it might easily haue happened, that the principall citizens might haue beene left out, to the great preiudice of the common∣wealth. They ordayned therefore that there shoulde yearely be chosen threescore fathers, not by casualty of The last 60. senators which are e∣lected are cal∣led adiunctes.lottes, but by soundnesse of iudgement. So you see that the Senate first consisteth of a hundred and twenty, of which threescore are by their proper tearme, called Se∣nators, the rest, Adiuncts: in the session of whose choice, there is commonly a whole day passed ouer. Now be∣sides this hundred and twenty lawfull Senators, those of the councell of tenne haue in the Senate equall au∣thoritie with the Senators, as also beside the Duke and the other councellors, the councell of the fortie haue the like, the iudges of capitall & waighty crimes, the maisters ouer the salt and corne, and the procurers of S. Marke, besides many others: so that in our time their number exceedeth two hundred & twenty, who in their offices haue all the power and authority of Se∣nators. The whole manner of the commonwealths go∣uernment belongeth to the senate. That which the se∣nate determineth is held for ratified and inuiolable. By The great au∣thority & po∣wer of the se∣nate.their authority and aduise is peace confirmed and war denounced. The whole rents and receipts of the com∣comwealth are at their appointment collected and ga∣thered in, and likewise laid out againe and defrayed. If there be any new taxations or subsidies to be laid vpon
the citizens, they are imposed, & likewise leuied by the Senates decree. And if at any time it shall seeme ne∣cessary for the good of the commonwealth, to create a new officer or magistrate vpon any sodaine vrgent oc∣casion, he is by the senate elected. Besides, the senate by a perpetuall prerogatiue, hath authority to chuse such Embassadors as are to bee sent to forraine princes, and likewise to create the colledge of those, whose of∣fice is to assemble the senate, and to report vnto them. Those are of Aristotle tearmed Praeconsultores, but wee Preconsultors or Sages.honouring them with a prouder title, do call them Sa∣ges, which name wee must in this discourse often vse, least otherwise I shoulde seeme to mislike of our com∣mon phrase of speaking. Neuerthelesse these sessions of the senate, in which both the Ambassadors and the Sages are elected, stand nothing so much in the arbiter∣ment of chaunce, as those before described, that is to say, the great councels, wherein the whole number of the citizens is assembled & gathered together: for eue∣ry one of the senators nameth one whom hee thinketh good, and then go to their suffrages, of which whoso∣euer shall haue more then the rest, prouided alwayes, that he haue about the halfe of the whole number on his side, is presently ratified and chosen, And if at any time the seruice & necessary occasion of the common∣wealth seeme to require the employment of some one in an office, which they thinke he would be vnwilling to accept, then doth euery one of the senators secretly in a little scrol note the name of him whom he thinketh fit for the charge, putting the same into a pot prouided ready for the purpose, after which the Secretary taketh those scrolles out, and readeth them all openly: & then
againe they go for euery one of those to their lottes, of which on whomsoeuer the greatest part doth fal, is pre∣sently pronounced chosen: prouided alwaies that hee haue more then halfe of the whole number. This manner of writing in scrolles was inuented, least other∣wise some might refrain from naming him whom they thought fitte for gouernment and discharge of that of∣fice: least in regarde of his vnwillingnesse to accept it, they might thereby incurre his displeasure & euill will, whereby through a priuate regard the common good might receiue preiudice. The manner which the Se∣nate vseth in their consulta∣tions and de∣crees. Now it remaineth that we declare the manner that the Senate vseth in determining, decreeing, and con∣sulting vpon those thinges which are to bee done: and in what sort the decrees of the Senate were wont to be executed. Sixteene Sages elected. Our elders were not ignorant, that if euery Senator should confusedly make report vnto the Senate, & then deliuer his opinion without limitation or restriction of that office to some particulars: there must of necessity follow a great trouble and intricatenesse in the Senate. Besides, it is by experience approoued, that the thing which dependeth generally alike vpon the care of all, is generally alike in a manner of all neglected. Therefore it was by our lawes ordained, that there shoulde bee chosen sixteene citizens out of the senate, which in respect of their farther knowledge and suffici∣ency aboue the rest, are of the common sort called Sages, we imitating Aristotle (in regarde that they are to con∣sult afore hand among themselues & then to councell the senate in those thinges that are to be handled) may well call them Preconsultors. These haue authority to
assemble the senate, and to make relation of each mat∣ter vnto them. This magistrate doeth not continue in The Sages di∣uided into three sorts or orders.office any longer then sixe monthes. But now these Sages are diuided into three sortes, of great difference and diuersity the one from the other: for in the first are sixe senators of the most noble and citizens, excelling the rest as well in dignity and estimation, as in prudent grauity and profoundnesse of knowledge. Their office principally is, that in waighty and important causes concerning the state of the commonwealth as well in matter of warres, as in thinges of peace, they are first a∣mong themselues to hold a long and deliberate consul∣tation, and then to giue ouer their councell and opini∣on to the senate. In the second sort or order are onely fiue, who though they haue equall authoritie with the other, in making report of all thinges to the senate, yet are they of farre lesse estimation and dignity. To them chiefly belongeth the care of the soldiers that are by the commonwealth entertayned in pay, and are vnder the gouernment of the Generall of the Venetian for∣ces. Of the third order there are also fiue to whom the charge of all sea matters is committed, of which onely and of nothing els they haue authority to make report vnto the senate. This office was held of our ancestors in great reputation, during the while that our common∣wealth did flourish & was famous in matters of nauiga∣tion: but when once our minds were bent to the enlar∣ging of our limites, and to the greatnesse of rule by lande: then beganne our seafaring matters to decline, and with them the reputation of this office, so that in this age of ours, young men and some in a manner beardlesse are admitted thereunto. These sixteene ci∣tizens
therefore, whose assembly among the Venetians by proper terme called, the Colledge, doe early in the morning meet together with the prince and the coun∣sellors, & first they spend the day till it be three a clocke, in giuing audience to priuate sutors, that haue any cause eyther with the commonwealth or with any par∣ticular magistrate, whose suits and causes they do there altogether determine and end, vnlesse the matter bee of such importance, that it behooueth them to make re∣port thereof vnto the senate. After three a clocke all priuate men are dismissed out of the court, & presently all such letters as are sent vnto the senate are read by one of the secretaries that belon∣geth to the state: after which the Sages or Preconsul∣tors do withdraw themselues apart into a Conclaue or councell chamber, there to consult of publike busines, vnlesse they be detayned by the Ambassadors of some Prince, that desireth audience of the Duke & the Col∣ledge, or by some other businesse of great and waighty moment. After that they are withdrawen & placed euery one in his seate: he which there presideth (which preroga∣tiue each of them inioyeth seuen dayes together, one after the other as his turne comes about) propoundeth that cause or matter, which they are in councell to de∣bate of. Then he demandeth of euery one his opinion, yet obseruing such order, that those of the first sort, as they are noblest in degree, so they bee first intreated to speake their aduise, and after them the other fiue, whom wee placed in the second ranke or order. Lastly if the question concerne any sea matters, the five of the last order, who haue charge therof are asked their opinion.
But if the matter propounded doe not pertaine to sea businesse, they are to holde their peace. In each ranke or order hee alwayes first speaketh his aduise, that had the Presidencie the last seuen daies, and then next vnto him the eldest of the company, and after him the rest accordingly vnto their age. Lastly of all, he which did propound the matter, & sitteth during those seuen daies as President and chiefe, vttereth his conceipt. The matter being at length well disputed of among them: whether they be all of one opinion or diuided into sun∣dry (as the dispositions of men are different and diuers) they go first to the prince & councel, before they assem∣ble the senate: & there do repeate the seuerall opinions of all, to which if the prince or any of the counsellors doe seeme to leane or giue his assent, or shall otherwise of himselfe yeeld any other different reason, the matter is then once againe debated of among them, and final∣ly euery mans opinion put in writing, which belongeth to those to doe that are secretaries of this three seuerall orders. The businesse then being well debated of, that is to be determined by authority of the Senate, the Se∣nate is assembled. When the senators are come into the Court, first all such letters as are of moment, and were deliuered to the Duke and Sages since the dismissing of the last Se∣nate, are there recited. Then are the opinions of the Sa∣ges repeated concerning those matters that were in their Colledge debated, whether they were all of one mind or of sundry, euen in a manner in the same sort, as the requestes of the people, of which Plato speaketh, were wont to be among the Athenians. But none other besides those, who (as I told you) are of the Venetians
called Sages, hath power or authority to make report vnto the senate, and then to confirme & establish his o∣pinion by authority of that order: alwaies I accept the Duke, the counsellors and the Presidents of the forty, of whom I will at large declare, and speake more here∣after. The opinions of all being read and perused in the senate, he that is for that weeke president of the first or∣der of Sages, ariseth if he so thinke good: if not the el∣dest or els any of the other, to whom being desirous to speake, the rest are contented to giue place, and from a seate or scaffold made of purpose somewhat higher then the rest, hee maketh his oration to the senate: al∣leadging such reasons as hee thinketh meetest to con∣firme his opinion, and to refute that which is maintay∣ned to the contrary, yet modestly, and with grauity, as it beseemeth a senate of so honourable a degree and order. After that he hath ended, another of the Sages that differeth from his opinion, ariseth, fortifying his owne aduise with the best reasons hee can yeelde, and refelling the former, and likewise the rest, if there bee any more that doe disagree from his. Then the third, (if there bee so many diuersities of censures among them) standeth vp, by proofes and argumentes en∣deuouring to maintayne and confirme that which he thinketh meete and conuenient: and so by course still is the matter pleaded and argued among them, till there remaine not any one more that will speake: as for the Senators no one of them may speake, till the Sages that will take the matter vpon them, haue made an ende: but when they haue with reasons, argu∣mentes and proofes contended and throughly deba∣ted
the matter of each side as much as shall seeme good vnto them, then haue the other Senators also libertie to speake: of which if any will gainesay or confirme a∣ny of the former opinions, or alleadge any new of his owne, he may freely do it at his pleasure: though as for the opinion of which himselfe shall bee author and in∣uentor, he may not himselfe make report thereof vnto the Senate: but if it shalbe thought good and profitable for the commonwealth, then commonly one of the Colledge, or a counsellor, or the President of the forty relateth the same vnto the Senate. By which means the matter being at length wel & throughly sifted and dis∣cussed: then doth the senate determine by the suffrages of those that are of that order, whether of the opinions is to be allowed: yet do they not with words or signes confirme or refute that opinion, as we reade the aun∣cient Romaines did, neyther do they speake it publike∣ly for euery one to heare: but their manner is to decide it with pots and suffrages, not much vnlike the order I told you was obserued in the Sessions. The secretaries of the senate bring forth as many pottes as there are opinions concerning the matter debated of, and one besides which is greene, into which are put the lottes of all those that do dislike that aduice and counsell: and another redde, which recei∣ueth the balles of those Senators, that remaine doubt∣full to whether opinion they shoulde encline. The other Senators euery one putteth his ball into his pot whose opinion he liketh and esteemeth aboue the rest: if hee like none at all then he putteth it into the greene potte, and if hee bee doubtfull, into the redde. The Counsellors do tell the balles, and that opinion is held
for ratification and decreed, which shall haue in fauour thereof the balles of halfe the senators, which number if none of them attaine vnto: then first, that opinion which is fauoured with fewest balles, is quite reiected, & for the rest they go to their lots againe: and so in that maner stil reiecting that which hath fewest bals, the con∣trouersie is at length brought onely betweene two, of which the one must of necessity haue aboue halfe the suffrages, and then the same is by the decree of the se∣nate authorized and allowed. One matter being dis∣patched, they beginne with another (vnlesse it bee too late in the day) alwaies obseruing the same manner as is aforesaid. The manner of giuing au∣dience & dis∣patching Am∣bassadors. If there come an Ambassador from any prince to the commonwealth of Venice, he is receyued of the Duke, the counsellors and the whole colledge, and doth be∣fore them expresse his ambassage: which being hearde, they do for that time dismisse him, demanding space to consult vpon the matter, which hauing done in sort & forme as you haue heard, they then demand the opini∣on of the Senate. To which the Duke first declareth the effect of the Ambassadors demande, and then the opi∣nions are read of all those that haue authoritie to make report to the senate, & finally in manner as before. The senate determineth what aunswere shall bee made vnto the Ambassadors demand: who being called in, a Se∣cretary readeth vnto him the decree of the Senate, vp∣on which hee is dismissed. This is in effect the whole summe, manner, and forme that the Senate vseth in The councel or colledge of the tenne.their consultations, decrees and councels: and there∣fore now I thinke it requisite in this place to say some∣what of the councell of the tenne, of which you haue
often heard me make mention. This councell or Col∣ledge of the tenne is among the Venetians of great and eminent authority, and of which any man may boldly say, that the whole safetie of the commonwealth de∣pendeth. I will therefore touch the beginning and ori∣ginall thereof, to the ende that the whole manner and course of the same may be the easilyer conceyued. Our elders did with a maruellous & in manner diuine pro∣uidence foresee, that as in mans bodie, through the cor∣ruption and putrefaction of one humor, many & most daungerous diseases doe commonly happen, which growe in time to bee the causes of death: so also in a commonwealth there are sometime wicked and disloi∣all citizens, that are causes thereunto of great troubles and calamities, whiles they aspire rather to the pride of a wicked and vniust commandement, then to the praise of an honest and quiet obedience: carried away in those damnable endeuors eyther with ambition, and desire of rule, or oppressed with intollerable debt, or otherwise hauing committed some haynous wickednes or crime, for which they stand in doubt of punishment: such as we reade was in Rome, Cateline, Silla, Marius, and finally Iulius Caesar, who hauing by tyranny gotten the com∣monwealth, did (in a manner) bring it to vtter desola∣tion and ruine. The like we reade of sundry common∣wealthes Sundry great and famous common∣wealths ouer∣throwen by the infidelity & ambition of some their priuate citi∣zens.of the Greekes, yea and those sometimes fa∣mous and of great glory, which by the vndermining ambition and treachery of some their wicked and vn∣faithfull citizens, were brought into seruitude and bon∣dage. But in these times of ours Italy it selfe hath yeel∣ded vs sufficient examples, all the cities whereof (in a manner) that were eyther gouerned by the people, or
by the nobility, being brought vnder the yoke or tirany of someone of their citizens. For which cause our pru∣dent elders laboured to establish this commonwealth of ours in all perfection and beauty, and to strengthen the same with such & so holesome lawes, that it might as much as in mans wisedome lyeth, preuent the incon∣uenience of so monstrous and miserable a fall: for they Nothing more to be feared then intestine broiles and cauil dissentiō.imagined that there was not any thing so much to bee doubted and feared, as an intestine enemy, or ciuill strife & sedition among the citizens. Calling there∣fore to minde, that among the Lacedemonians the E∣phores were mighty and of great authority, and among the Athenians the Areopagites, and so likewise among the Romaines the Decemuiri or tenne men, insomuch The cause of the creation of ten in the city of Venice.that they made lawes: they thought it not amisse by imitation of their example, though in an vnlike cause, to create in this our citie some magistrate of authority and power, whose office aboue all other things should be, to haue especiall care to see that among the citizens should not arise any strife or dissention, whereby there might ensue any scandall or vprore: and to preuent factions, or the attemptes of any wicked citizen that shoulde conspire against the liberty of the common∣wealth: of which sort of mischiefe if there should by euill destiny, any creepe into the commonwealth, they then to haue absolute authority to punish and chasten the same, least otherwise the commonwealth might thereby receiue harme. But so great an authority and puissance coulde not haue beene committed to few without danger, neither if to many, woulde it then haue been formidable: there∣fore to auoide the one and the other inconuenience,
they ordayned and established this Colledge of tenne. They continue in this office a yeare, and haue adioy∣ned vnto them the Duke and the sixe Counsellors, so that the whole Colledge commeth to make vp the iust number of seuenteene citizens, to whome this great power and authoritie is giuen. Of these tenne there are three euery month chosen and elected by lotte, who are Presidentes of the Colledge, and The heads of the Tenne.by common phrase of speech called the heades of the tenne, and they haue authority to assemble the whole Colledge of the tenne, and to make report vnto them. They haue aparte by themselues a chamber, wherein they assemble when they sitte in councell. They haue also vnder them priuate and particular officers, as Por∣ters, Vshers, and certayne that are allowed for their garde. So that there is not any other Tribunall of ma∣gistrates gone vnto with greater obseruaunce and ce∣remonie. Thither resort allthose that haue any thing to do in their Colledge. They likewise reade all letters written to the Colledge, and make report of them to the same, for doing of the which with the greater suf∣ficiency, one of those Presidents alone by himselfe hath not authority to make report, but they must bee eyther two to make reporte of the same matter, or els foure Councellors. For the same cause also and to auoide the rashnesse and temeritie that some fewe of them might otherwise vse in alteration of any thing, it is orday∣ned, that if they will cancell or vndoe any thing that is already established and fully confirmed, they must at least haue the Suffrages of two partes of the Colledge, for confirmation of that which they
shall doe, which otherwise is helde to bee voide and of no effect. They haue also an order that the offendor is The offender neuer suffred to come into the Colledge, not any friend or Lawyer to plead for him.neuer suffred to come into the colledge, when they are to giue iudgement of him, nor any friend, kinseman, or Lawyer for him to pleade his cause: which priuiledge is granted to offendors in any other court whatsoeuer, where their cause is handled. The manner vsed in their iudgements is in this sort: The offendor is examined of the Presidents of the colledge, and his confession writ∣ten, & then the matter is reported to the Colledge, the presidents of which & the other Iudges that are present do plead as well in the behalf of the accuser as of the of∣fendor neuer determining of any great matter, but with an exceeding moderation of iudgement. In the begin∣ning the charge onely of preuenting and remedying all such things as any way should offend the ciuil agree∣ment of the commonwealth, was committed to the care of the tenne. But afterwardes certaine other grie∣uous & enormous offences, as making of false money, sodomie, and such like were also brought vnder the se∣uerity and censure of this sharpe and stricte manner of iudgement. And in these times of ours this authority of the tenne hath yet much more enlarged his bounds: for they haue power giuen them to set amercements vp∣on sundry offences, and to punish those that shall blas∣pheme the name of God, or of the blessed Virgine: and it is likewise or dayned, that whatsoeuer secrete matters that should concerne the state of the commonwealth any way: that such (I say) should bee brought and dis∣closed vnto them: who neuerthelesse do not determine any thing of great moment without the opinion of the
Senate. To the end therefore that a few citizens should not alone haue such successiue authority in so waighty affaires, there are called and admitted into this colledge the Sages of the first and seconde order: likewise the Fifteen sena∣tors ascribed to the colledge of the ten, who are called Adiunctes.Aduocators and procurers of S. Marke, whose office is held in great estimation and reuerence. There are be∣sides fifteene Senators ascribed to this Colledge, who are called Adiunctes, but all these here rehearsed haue not the priuiledge of suffrage, but onely the seuenteen first, and these fifteene Adiunctes: so that the whole number of those that haue authority of suffrage are two & thirty. The rest are depriued of this power and priui∣ledge, though otherwise they be present at all their bu∣sinesse. The fifteene Adiunctes were not accustomed to be elected neyther of the Senate, neyther of the ses∣sions of the great Councell, but the tenne men did of themselues make choyce of fifteene such Senators as they best liked for their assistantes and companions: though now the same is altered, and the fifteene are chosen by the sessions of the great Councell, as the o∣ther magistrates are. That there hath great vtilitie re∣dounded to the commonwealth of Venice through this councell & Colledge of tenne: experience it selfe hath made most manifest & plaine. For two hundred & ten yeares since Marino Phalerio that then was Duke, hauing turned all his thoughtes to tiranny and vsurpation, was likely to haue giuen a great & deadly blow to the liber∣ty Marino Pha∣lerio Duke of Venice, pub∣likely be∣headed.of our commonwealth, if by the graue authority & wisedome of the tenne, he had not beene oppressed & put downe, and receiued the rewarde of his impiety & wickednesse: for by their iudgement and sentence, hee had his head publiquely stricken off, and with him sun∣dry
other citizens of great nobility, that together with him had conspired the ruine of their countries libertie, and besides his memory was deliuered to posterity with an eternall blot of dishonour and infamy: For in those places where the pictures of our princes are curiously set forth and painted, with Epitaphes and re∣membraunces of those vertuous deedes, which they haue done in the behalfe and seruice of their countrey, the seate of Marino Phalerio is left bare without any picture at all, saue onely a few verses, signifying vnto the reader, that this Duke was for his offences (because I will not vary the wordes as they stand written) stric∣ken with the axe: a conspiracie without doubt of passing wickednesse, and exceeding daunger, in appa∣rance not vnlikely to haue wrought the vtter ouer∣throw of the commonwealth, if by the authority of the colledge of ten, the same had not beene presently extin∣guished. Likewise sundry other citizens, that being tickled with this rumor of ambition, had published certaine plausible lawes, to draw vnto them the good willes of the people, were ouertaken by the authority of this colledge, & presently cut off: whereby it is come to passe, that through the power of this Colledge al∣waies assisted by the goodnesse of God, no such perni∣cious infection hath as yet beene able to eate into our commonwealth. Thus the principal partes of our com∣monwealthes are by vs already expressed, but now to the end that our vndertaken work may be in euery part perfect and accomplished, we will speake somewhat of the remaining magistrates, as well those, to whose handes is committed the administration of iustice, as those that haue the handling & ordering of the publike
rents, and withall of the manner of gouerning those ci∣ties that are vnder the Venetian commonwealth, as also of their captaines, nauies & armies, both by sea and by land. Lastly I will make mention of certaine statutes & ordinances, by which the danger of the common peo∣ples mislike, in that they also haue not part in gouerning the commonwealth is cleerly auoided, with their great satisfaction and contentment: I will likewise shew, that the training and exercising the youthes to the exercises of warre is not in the Citie neglected, as some suppose. But before I proceed farther to these particular demon∣strations, I thinke it not beside the purpose to aduertise the reader, that in this manner of the Senates consulta∣tion, of which I haue spoken, and likewise in that of the Colledge of Tenne, there doth plainely appeare a cer∣tain mixture of the lawes of a popular state, with the go∣uernment of a nobilitie. For whereas the senate cannot deliberate of any thing if first report therof be not made vnto them of the Sages, therein appeareth a state of no∣bilitie: but that the Sages haue not any power, vnlesse they consult with the Senate, and haue by authority thereof, their opinions confirmed, tasteth altogether of a popular gouernment, so that this iust mixture & temperature, which maketh the perfect measures and meanes of gouernment to be vnited in the true forme and shape of a commonwealth, is founde not onely in the whole body together, but also in euery parte and particular member of this our commonwealth. But returning whence I digressed: I will first of all handle that part which pertayneth and belongeth vnto Iustice. All right & iustice therfore which is wont to be admi∣nistred
of magistrates, is diuided into two parts, for ey∣ther it consisteth in the punishmentes of lewde & wic∣ked men, that shall in any notable sorte trespasse impi∣ously against God, and traiterously against their coun∣trey, or wickedly against any citizen, or member there∣of in particular: or els it concerneth the iudgement and determination of litigious controuersies and ciuill cau∣ses. Criminall and ciuill iudges.Therefore are there also in Venice two kindes of Iudges, the one seruing for the decision of ciuill causes, the other for the iudgement of capital crimes, of whom we will first speake, and then of the other. Some offences are esteemed to be small and light, in regard of the proper nature of the offence, or els of the condition of him that offended: others are accounted to be more grieuous and of greater importance, eyther through the qualitie of the misdeede it selfe, or els through the nobility and degree of him that doth it: whence it commeth that these capitall iudges are also diuided into two: the one for matters of great mo∣ment and grieuous enormity: the other for crimes lesse haynous and of smaller waight: which diuision of iudgements as it was first ordained with an exceeding reason and founde foundation, so hath experience ap∣proued it for allowable & of high commendation: we will first speake of the chiefest, and then of the rest. Besides those offences, which we told you were com∣mitted to the censure of the tenne: all other great and waightie crimes, being by the Aduocators reported of, and by the Colledge of fortie well pondered and de∣bated, are wont all to be determined, and punnishment according to the qualitie of the crime to bee inflicted vpon those that shalbe found faulty therein. These forty
that haue the examination & handling of waighty cri∣minall causes, are commonly called the xl. criminall Iudges: we will speake of eyther, but we will first begin with the Aduocators. The office of the Aduoca∣tors.The office of the Aduocators was in times passed in great authoritie and maruelous estimation: the duety and function therereof being to defend the lawes pure and inuiolate, without suffring them in any one point The Aduoca∣tors in Venice resemble the auncient Tribunes of the Ro∣maine people.ro be blemished, so that their authority and power is much like vnto that of the Tribunes of the Romaine people, but that they were to defend the liberty of the people, and ours onely the force of the lawes: so that in my iudgement they may, and not vnfitly be tearmed the Tribunes of the lawes. But we to auoide all ambi∣guities, will still retaine the common and accustomed worde: they onely pleaded and made report vnto the people, but ours to the xl. men for small causes, for greater to the Senate, for greatest of all to the greater Councell, if so they shall thinke good: so that in aunci∣ent time the anthority of this office was passing hono∣rable. But now since the mightinesse and encreased greatnesse of the Tenne, this office is growen to bee of lesse account, and the estimation thereof much obscu∣red. Neuerthelesse seeing there belongeth to this of∣fice so ample an authority of reporting in all causes, but especially the guarding and defending of the lawes: & seeing that those which haue committed any excesse or crime, seeme to haue broken and transgressed the lawes, it seemed good that those offences should in a certaine peculiar sort bee corrected by the censure of the Aduocators, though of themselues they haue not any authority of determining any thing absolutely a∣gainst
the offendors, vnlesse it be in some small cau∣ses: the rest are all ordered by the sentence of the Councell. In this place, I thinke it not from the purpose to ex∣plane The manner of capitall iudgements.the manner and meane of capitall iudgements, which are giuen vpon the reporte of the Aduocators, seeing that (vnlesse I be deceyued) the like custome is not any where obserued, withall I shall thereby the bet∣ter and plainlier make you vnderstand what the autho∣rity is of this office of Aduocators. When any crime or offence is brought before the Aduocators (if the same be thought worthy of their censure) then presently is he, whose name is brought by some one of them (the charge thereof belonging chief∣ly to three) declared and argued to be guiltie, and then report is thereof made ouer by him that argued him, to what councell himselfe shall best like, though vsually such matters are referred to the colledge of the xl which haue presidence, and authority ouer capitall crimes & iudgements. And there the matter beeing well debated of, the councel determineth, whether the offender shal be put in prison or tortured, or otherwise allowed to de∣fend his cause at libertie, who is either by the decree of the councell presently sent for, or els secretly apprehen∣ded by the Officers and Sergeantes that attende vpon the Aduocators: and then hee is eyther at libertie, or as a prisoner examined vpon the matter: he maketh his aunswere, and witnesses and proofes are produ∣ced on each side, and each particular registred in wri∣ting, as well in the behalfe of the offendor, as against him, and a coppie thereof giuen him, and a time of re∣spite appointed him to instruct his Aduocators, & such
as hee shall chuse to pleade for him: and they likewise prouide themselues of such proofes and argumentes, as may best serue for his defence, and for the dis∣proofe and confutation of such reasons and testimo∣nies, as shall be vrged against him, and then the matter commeth to the pleading. I cannot here ouerslip an ancient custome obserued of our forepassed elders euen vnto this age of ours, which is, that if any doe want meanes and abilitie to entertayne an Aduocate or Lawyer to pleade and defende his cause: then are there two Aduocates ap∣pointed him at the charge of the commonwealth, to speake and argue in the defence and maintenance of his right. For thereof the lawes haue a speciall regarde, Two aduo∣cates appoin∣ted by the common∣wealth to de∣fend the cause of those that want meanes & abilitie to entertaine them.that no one doe receiue punishment without being first admitted to say what hee can in iustification of himselfe. But after that due ceremonies are obserued with the offendor, and all respectes and liberties affor∣ded him, that the defence of his cause requireth, the ad∣uocators doe warne the councell, and a day is appoin∣ted for the tryall of his cause. The Councell being assembled, the accusation of the parties that stande vpon their tryall, belongeth to the Aduocators, who are in that behalfe to behaue themselues with great sharpenesse, vehemence and se∣uerity, euen in as inuectiue a manner (if possible they could attaine and reach thereunto) as that which Cice∣ro vsed against Verres or Antonius, yet so that they refrayne from vnseemely rayling, and do not digresse or wander out of the matter with extremitie of spite∣full words. For whosoeuer maliciously raileth, seemeth
rather to bewray a mind intemperate and hatefull, then any way to aduaunce the commonwealthes cause. For in this point the matter is farre otherwise among the Venetians, then it was in times passed among the Ro∣maines. Aunciently in Rome any citizen whatsoeuer might impleade another, and with all bitternesse accuse him before the Iudges: but in Venice no priuate man may performe such office, the same by the lawes of the commonwealth belonging to the dignity & magistra∣cie of the Aduocators. In which point mee thinketh our ancestors did rightlier imitate the nature of things, and had therein a more regardfull foresight to maintain the citizens in agreement, then had the Romaines. For seeing that an offence committed is a breach of the lawes, & a scandall to the commenwealth, & the lawes and the commommonwealth are to exact punishment thereof: who can be fitter to require the punishment of him that offendeth, or who ought thereunto to bend greater indeuour, then that Magistrate whose authority, rule & dignity is wholly giuen him to defend the laws? Neyther can any priuate citizen play the part of an ac∣cuser, without exceeding enuie and hatred of him whom he shall prosecute, whence easily there might sedition & trouble arise among the citizens, which in∣conuenience is by vs notably auoyded, by laying this whole charge of accusations vpon a Magistrate, who is not to handle the same according to any priuate or par∣ticular dissentious conceipt, but according to the pre∣script rule and forme of the lawes: so that it hath neuer lightly beene hearde of, that euer any blame was impu∣ted to an Aduocator for vsing vehement inuectiues, or
being a sharpe accuser, but rather the greater applause and praise thereby to arise vnto him among all the citi∣zens. But let vs now returne to our before mentioned manner of iudgements. The Councell being assembled, the Aduocator plai∣eth the parte of a bitter accuser, strayning the vttermost inuention of his wittes with all vehemence against the offendor, first obiecting vnto him the offence, confir∣ming the same with witnesses, and then strengthening his obiection with probabilities and likelihoodes of coniecture: hauing ended his speech, the aduocate of the offender pleadeth in the Clyentes behalfe: After which if any of the Aduocators will speake afresh, be∣fore the Iudges giue sentence, he hath libertie so to do: likewise the Lawyers of the defendant haue leaue to aunswere and to confute, if they can, the opposed argu∣ments. And so of eyther side the cause is debated and tossed to and fro, till eyther the offender or the Aduo∣cator whose turne it is to speake, doth declare that he hath no more to say, which done, the offender and his aduocates are commanded out of the Court, and the Aduocators are shutte into a roome apart with the Iudges and their Secretaries, not any one else being suffred to be there. The Aduocators first doe make a motion vnto the Iudges of punishing the offender, demaunding their opinions whether they thinke him worthy of punishment or no, not naming or appoin∣ting any one certayne kinde of punishment, which Two manner of iudge∣ments.custome was (in a manner) obserued by the Atheni∣ans: for in Athens the Iudges gaue two sentences, in the first eyther condemning or absoluing the priso∣ner. If in the first hee were condemned, then was the
manner of his punishment determined of in the second, as out of Platoes Apologie of Socrates may plainly bee perceiued, the very like order of iudgement is that in manner which we do vse: first (as I say) the aduocators make a motion vnto the Iudges of punishing the offen∣der. Then the Iudges go vnto their suffrages, for by suf∣frages among the Venetians all things are determined. Three pots are brought forth, by the one of which the offender is condemned: by the other hee is absolued in maner without any correctiō, & by the third are known the opinion of those, which doe seeme yet to doubt whether course is to be taken: the first of condemnation is white, the second of absolution greene, the third of doubtfulnes redde. Euery of the Iudges, whether the cause be disputed of by the forty (as vsually it is) or els that the senate be consulted with (which seldome hap∣peneth) & that only in great & waighty causes, or whe∣ther it be by the aduocators reported ouer to the great councell, which is most seldome, & neuer but in mat∣ters exceedingly enormous, to the ende to haue his suf∣frage vndiscerned, letteth fall into whether of these The manner of the priso∣ners tryall.three pots he pleaseth a little linnen ball: which being done, the presidents of the councell doe number the balles, and if more then the half be in sauor of the priso∣ners liberty, he is presently pronounced free, & the re∣quest of the aduocators reiected. But if more then the half of those bals, be found in the pot of condemnation, he is presently condemned: if neither of both exceede the half, but that the greater part of the Iudges put their suffrages into the pot of doubtfulnes: then his cause is deferred ouer til another day, & to the better discussion of the Iudges: if he be absolued, he hath no more to do
but is presently set at liberty: if his terme be prolonged, then there is a new day appointed both to him and the Iudges for the handling of his cause: the Aduocators accusing him and his Lawyers, as wel as they can, refu∣ting the obiected crimes. After that the matter is deba∣ted & pleaded on both sides, the Iudges go to their bals againe, and if then neyther there bee any thing conclu∣ded in regard that the greater part of the lots be found in the pot, that agreeth the doubtfulnesse & irresoluti∣on of the Iudges, then once againe is the cause put o∣uer, and a new day appointed both to the prisoner and the Iudges: which being come, and the Iudges casting their lots as before, there is no farther regard helde of those that are doubtfull, insomuch that if the lottes bee not in eyther parte iustly equall, of necessitie the priso∣ner must bee eyther acquitted or condemned: if hee bee acquitted, hee hath (as I said before) no more to doe: but if he bee condemned, then they are to de∣termine of the manner of his punishment: concerning the which both the Aduocators and the presidents of the Colledges of Iudges doe make motions. Alwaies The office of the Aduoca∣tors enclyning more to seue∣rity thē mercy. The heades of the forty and the counsel∣lors propound lighter penal∣ties.the Aduocators doe propounde that punishment, which to that sorte of offence doth seeme most sharp and grieuous, their office and dutie being more to incline to seuerity then to mercie. The other doe ac∣custome to propounde lighter penalties, vnlesse the fault be so hainous, that there remain no place for pitty, or els that the Aduocators haue vsed greater lenitie then becommeth their place and office. The opinions of all being proposed, the punishment that the priso∣ner must suffer, is in the very same manner and fashion concluded & determined on (as I told you aboue) that the decrees of the senate are wont to be ratified, when
the Sages are of sundry & diuers opinions. The manner of which if I should repeat againe, I should trouble the reader with a needlesse iteration, and perchance be ac∣counted tedious for my labor: Let this suffise, that that opinion of the Iudges is pronounced and executed, which (the other being reiected) hath in fauour there∣of more then halfe the suffrages. No one citizē nor magi∣strate allowed for an abso∣lute iudge or arbitrator in any thing. Here me thinketh I shall not doe amisse to acquaint you with two statutes wisely enacted by our ancestors. The first is, that they would not by any meanes, that any citizen, no nor magistrate, should bee an arbitrator without appeale in any thing, but that the supreme right & iudgement of all things shoulde belong to the councels or colledges. And the other no lesse profita∣ble then the former is, that the Iudges should not open∣ly with their tongue pronounce their opinions: but se∣cretly by suffrages, the maner of which you haue heard: either of which in my opinion, grounded vpon excee∣ding reason: First for so great an authority in determi∣ning matters, to haue been cōmitted to one magistrate as it had beene dangerous: so if now the matter fall by chaunce otherwise then well out, the Citie cannot find fault with any particular citizens. And with as great wisedome was it ordained, that iudgementes and de∣crees should not bee openly with speech pronounced: for the Iudges by this inuention of secret suffrages doe iudge much more freely then they woulde haue done, if they had beene to deliuer their iudgementes with their tongue, in which case sometimes eyther through ambition they wold haue been seduced from iustice, or els feared the offence of their well deseruing friendes, or els doubted the indignation and mislike of some greater person: withal this commodity ther is, that
euery Iudge followeth his own iudgemēt, without de∣pending vpon the authority of any other Iudge: which might easily happen, that hee that had before spoken, were, reputed to be graue and wise, which point hath not been omitted of excellent Philosophers: but now seeing the whole manner of iudgementes is of vs ex∣pressed: wee will returne to the forty iudges of Capi∣tall causes, of which I had begunne to speake. Their Colledge was instituted of our City, to the ende that the Aduocators making report vnto them of Capitall causes; by their deliberation, wicked men and male∣factors might receiue condigne correction & punish∣ment: for vnlesse it be in great and waightie matters, and such as the commonwealthes may bee interessed by the decision of them, the Aduocators doe neuer consult with the Senate, and verie rarely with the great Councell: but all Capitall causes are brought to this Colledge of the forty, whose sentence is helde for ra∣tifyed and firme without admitting any appeale. Their office lasteth eight moneths, after that they haue before spent sixteen moneths in determining of ciuill causes. For there are in the common wealthes of Venice three The office of the forty cri∣minall IudgesCourtes or Colledges, euery one consisting of Forty iudges, two of them are for the iudging and determi∣ning of ciuile causes, and the thirde of which wee speake for Capitall: but they are in this sort distribu∣ted, that these forty Capitall Iudges, so soone as they haue finished their lymited time of office, do returne priuately into order, and forthwith other forty are cho∣sen into their places by the session of the great Coun∣cell, and yet the forty new chosen, doe not presently come to the iudging of Capitall causes, but in place
of these former Capitall Iudges, doth the other Col∣ledge of Forty succeede, that did in the meane space of these eight moneths, exercise the iudgemēt of ciuile causes within the City. And againe in their place doth succeede the other Colledge of forty, which also in this eight moneths space, had the handling of ciuil-foreyne causes, and in their place do succeed these last forty new∣ly created, and so by turne they passe from foreyn causes to causes of the city, and lastly to those which are capital, in which iudgements, from one as I say to another they continue two years. These three courts of iudges haue their three peculiar appellations. The first of forreyne causes is called the new Colledge, the second of home∣ciuil causes, the old, and the third that iudgeth vpon life and death, the criminal Colledge: these last forty, beside the high power of their iudgement in capital offences and crimes are also admitted into the Senate, and haue in that honorable Councell also their authority of suf∣rages. They haue besides three heads or presidentes of their company, which are euery two monethes chosen new by Lot, and in their turnes they sit with the Duke and Councellers, and haue with them equal authority of making report ouer of whatsoeuer they shal please, eyther to the Senate or to the great Coun∣cell, the same neuerthelesse in such manner as I tolde you before: neyther without reason are these forty yonger men mingled with the Senators, which are for the most part olde men in regarde that the heate of their nature maketh a temperature with the others coldnesse, yet are not these young men equall in num∣ber to the olde men, but much fewer, onely inough to put some heat into the cold deliberatiōs of the Senate;
which somtimes exceeding & in matters of some nature is necessarie. Besides by this grant of Senator like autho∣rity to the forty, there may seeme to bee in some forte a communication of the commonwealths gouernmēt, with the lower and meaner sort of citizens, such as for the most part they are that do exercise this office of the forty▪ wherein our auncesters haue seemed to vse & obserue a certaine kinde of popular lawe: for to euery of these three Colledges of forty men there is a certain rated allowance of mony appointed and giuen for e∣uery day that they shall assemble and meete, and there∣fore very seldome do those that are rich, require this office, and if they should, they would as easily be repul∣sed. The honor thereof being without difficulty gran∣ted to the needier sort, prouided alwaies, that their life beare with it the fame of an honest conuersation: by which meanes the pouerty of meane gentlemen is not only in some sort prouided for, but alsoo the gouern∣ment and administration of the common wealth, is as∣well in some sort communicated with the meaner and poorer sorte of Citizens, as with those that are highliest remarkable eyther for riches or nobilitie, which custome hath a reference to the popular estate. By these thinges you may perceiue that there appea∣reth in eueriy parte of the Venetian common wealth, that moderation, and temperature, which in the be∣ginning of this worke, I tolde you our auncesters did so highly indeuour to establish, which is, that the po∣pular estate should haue an intelligence and mixture with that of the nobilitie, yet the same in that order seasoned, that the parts of the Nobilitie should bee both
more in number and mightier in sway. We haue now in my opinion sufficiently discour∣sed both of the Aduocators, as also of the forty crimi∣nall Iudges▪ who are to that ende instituted, that they should carefully looke into all such offences as are any way notorious, eyther through the qualitie of the of∣fence, or the condition of the offendor: Now the time Two sorts of inferior ma∣gistrates.requireth, that we should briefly speake of some infe∣rior magistrates, that haue authority to punish offences of lesse qualitie, and moment, eyther in regarde of the meanes of the faulte it selfe, or the slender regard & quality of the person that commiteth the same. These also are of two sortes, the one hath power of life and death, the other not, their authority stretching no farther then to the punishment of Rogues and Har∣lots, whome they cause to bee imprisoned or whipt with rods, euery of them according to the proportion of their committed lewdnes. The first magistrate also that hath power to giue sentence of life and death, is likewise deuided into two sortes. For the selfe same Iudges doe not search out and examine and call to try∣all the offendor, but the first being the heades of the officers by night doe throughly examine the cause of Officers of night.the offender, and register vp in writing the deposition of the witnesses, & whatsoeuer else the party hath con∣fessed, eyther of his owne accord, or els by the con∣straint of torture: and then finally represent the whole to the iudges of the Properties. This Magistrate diffe∣reth Iudges of the properties.much from the former, and giueth sentence of death, when the cause in handling is capitall. But if it be a lighter offence to bee punished onely with whip∣ping
or imprisonment, the captaines of the officers by night, do of themselues dispatch the matter without as∣king the aduise of the Colledge, eyther for the impriso∣ning or torturing the offendor, which authority neuer thelesse the office of the Aduocators hath not, but must first acquaint the Colledge and proceede according to the decrees thereof, neither is the same so ordayned without exceeding reason and foundation, for that for euery small matter, and the offence of euery baggage fellow, the Councell should haue been mooued, both the common wealthes should haue beene ouermuch troubled with many impertenent brablers, and also lewd fellowes should haue had a greater scope of liuing licentiously, through the hope of escaping punishmēt. For greater expedition thereof, of these kinds of iudge∣ments, the heads or chieftaines of the officers by night do obtaine that authority, of which the Aduocators are depriued. These officers of the night are six, and six likewise are those meane officers, that haue onely power to correct base vagabonds and tryfeling offen∣ces. Those that do execute this office are called heades of the tribes of the city, because out of euery tribe (for the city is deuided into six tribes) there is elected an officer of the night, and a head of the tribe, which cu∣stome also we obserue in the election of our Coun∣cellers, as here before I haue expressed. The duty of eyther of these officers is, to keepe a watch euery other night by turn, within their tribes and now the one and then the other, to make rounds about his quarter, till the dawning of the day, being al∣wayes guarded and attended on with weaponed offi∣cers▪
and serieants, and to see that there be not any dis∣order done in the darkenes of the night, which alwaies imboldneth men ill disposed to naughtinesse, and that there be not any houses broken vp, nor theeues, nor rogueslurking in corners with intent to do violence. At the first beginning of the city, eyther of these of∣fices was of great estimation: but since, new Magi∣strates being added, according to the chaunge of the times, and the occasion of the common wealth: the same is much diminished and of lesser respect, for the chiefe authority being transferred ouer to the new of∣ficers, there remaineth onely in their courtes the deci∣sion of base and baggage matters, as the suddes or lees of the rest. Hetherto there is inough saide of those Magi∣strates that do determine Capitall causes: In the next volume we will speake of ciuile Iudgementes. The end of the third booke.
The fourth Booke of the Magistrates and commonwealth of Venice. IT hath beene alwaies a perpetuall continuing custome in the commō The whole high and chief authority of all thinges be∣longing to the Councels and not to any par¦ticular magi∣strates.wealth of Venice, that no magistrate whatsoeuer should haue in matters of waight and importance, high & chief authority: but that the same shoulde wholy belong to the col∣ledge, or rather vsing the common manner of speech to the Councels, insomuch that in ciuile causes such as In ciuile cau∣ses the party pre¦iudiced may after iudge∣ment giuen appeale to the Auditors and to the Col∣ledge of the Forty.shall exceede the summe of fiue and forty crownes, there is not any magistrate from whose iudgement, the party may not appeale to the Auditors of the ci∣uile causes, and to the colledge of forty, of whome we haue heere aboue made mention. But to the end that the whole manner of these ciuile iudgements may be made manifest and plaine, wee Two sorts of Auditors the olde and the new.will begin with the Auditors, which are of two sortes, that is to say, the olde and the new, the olde doe de∣riue their name from the antiquitie of their office, The old Audi¦tors more an∣cient then the new.and being much more ancient then that of the new, which was altogether vnknowne in this common∣wealth, till the same beganne to haue Dominion
ouer the maine Lande, many ages after the building of the City. These olde Auditors haue in manner the same authority in determination of ciuile causes, after they are debated of & iudged by the ciuile iudges, as the aduocators haue in all such matters, as any way they shall thinke to be offensiue to the lawes, I meane in re∣ceauing of appeales, or making of report ouer. When therefore by the ciuile Iudges, there is any sentence giuen against any man: it is lawfull for him who receiueth preiudice thereby, to appeale from their indgement to the Auditors, the cause then being brought into their court, and of eyther side pleaded & debated of those betweene whome the controuersie dependeth, if the same exceed not the summe of fiftie crowns, they may of their own authority, so they agree all in one end and determine the same, without the Colledge of the forty: or if they disagree in opinion, then one of them hath authority to make report ouer Three Iudges that haue au∣thoritie to iudge and de∣termine on thinges that are found,to a very small Colledge, where the company of ey∣ther Auditors do note, and likewise three other Iudges, that vsually do sit vpon thinges that are founde: and there these lesser affaires are absolutely determined. But if the whole cause did amount aboue the rate of the foresaid summe, before our time the matter coulde not haue beene brought into the Colledge of the Forty, vnlesse someone of the Auditors had interposed himselfe, and made reporte of the sen∣tence so giuen by the Iudges, vnto the forty. But in this time of ours there is a Law made, whereby li∣berty is graunted vnto him against whome the for∣mer Iudges haue pronounced sentence, that

Presently vpon the Auditors report the former iudges were before our time summoned into the Colledge of the fortie, and there eyther magistrate admitted to the maintenance of his cause by plea: but now I know not by what negligence by little and little it is brought to passe, that the former Iudges, from whose sentences the appeale is brought, doe neyther pleade, nor bee so much as present at the handling of their cause in the Colledge of the forty: onely being ci∣ted by an officer, their answere is, that, that which lawe and iustice is, may go forward. But this custome that the auditors should first make re∣port vnto the colledge of such causes as were by appeale brought vnto them, and plead in maintenance of them, hauing continued till our time, is now wholly abroga∣ted: and onely the Aduocates of those between whom the controuersie resteth, doe vse that office, in defen∣ding the cause of their clientes: whereby it is come to passe, that this office which was before time so honou∣rable, is now become to bee greatly obscured and e∣clipsed. The iudges of ciuile causes obserue the same order in their iudge∣ments as the criminal iudges. These fortie Iudges of ciuill causes doe in a manner obserue that order and custome in their iudgementes, as you heard me say before is vsually wont to bee obser∣ued of the forty Iudges of capitall causes: onely this dif∣ference
there is that in causes wherein the life and e∣state of any man is called in question, there is no cer∣tayne time of speech limited or imposed, whereas in A certaine time of speech limited.ciuile controuersies there is a certaine time appointed, beyond which they may not by any meanes lengthen or extend their plea: that is to say, an houre and a halfe onely to each of them that pleadeth: neyther are there in the decision of these ciuile iudgements many opini∣ons alleadged, out of which the Colledge may con∣clusiuely chuse one that shalbe best to their liking, as in consultation vpon the punishment of malefactors, (I told you aboue is vsually the custome) but it is onely here debated, whether the sentence giuen by the for∣mer Iudges shall be confirmed or abrogated: if any of the Auditors make intercession to that ende, then shall the question be of abrogating and cancelling the same: but otherwise if the matter come vnto the Col∣ledge without the intercession or addresse of any Au∣ditor, then the Presidentes of the Colledge, after the matter is of each side throughly pleaded, doe rather propose the strengthening and confirming of the for∣mer iudgement then the disalowance or cancelling thereof. Presently all the sworne Iudges doe prepare Three seuerall pots brought forth, a white, a greene▪ and a redde.themselues and go vnto their suffrages, and three pots likewise are brought forth: in the greene the former iudgement is cancelled: in the white it is approued, and in the thirde which is redde, are the balles of those that doe yet remaine doubtfull, and would haue the matter to bee adiourned and deferred. Nothing is helde for absolute and decreede, vnlesse more then the halfe doe conclude and agree together in one opi∣nion, eyther for the ratifying, or disanulling thereof:
of which if the iudges bee not throughly perswaded, so that neyther of both bee decided, the same is then deferred ouer till the next day, and the same ceremo∣nies againe renewed: and if neyther then it bee de∣termined, the Colledge is called agayne the thirde day, and the selfe same proceedinges vsed as before, saue onely that after eyther side hath sufficiently plea∣ded, and that they go againe to their suffrages, there is no farther reckoning made of those that remayne doubtfull and vnperswaded, so that vnlesse the suffra∣ges bee altogether equall, it is determined, and fully ended one way or other, and the former iudgement Vpon abroga∣tion of the former iudge¦ment the plaintife hath libertie to re∣nue his acti∣on.eyther fully confirmed or vtterly abrogated. Ne∣uerthelesse vppon abrogation of the former iudge∣ment the playntife is not so put off and debarred, but that hee hath libertie to renewe his action agayne: for this newe cancelling serueth to no other ende, but onely to frustrate and make voide and inualide But vpon the confirmation of the former sentence the party interes∣sed is vtterly debarred.the force of the former iudgement: whereas the ap∣probation and allowance confirmeth and ratifieth for euer the iudgement that was giuen and pronounced, neyther is there left to the defendant, any place ey∣ther of prouocation or appeale, or meane to call the matter in question, vnlesse there fall out some new mat∣ter or occasion. This shall bee sufficient as concerning the olde Auditors: now wee will briefly say somewhat of the newe. This Magistrate was vnknowen and not crea∣ted in our commonwealth, till such time as the Vene∣tian Empire beganne to imbrace the mayne lande that bordered vppon our Lakes. To these may ap∣peales be brought from the iudgements & sentences of
The New au∣ditors meddle onely with forraigne matters. such gouernors & magistrates as without the precinctes of our Citie doe administer iustice to people that doe liue vnder our subiection: for the olde Auditors were not of themselues able and sufficient to vnderstand and dispatch both the causes of the citie, and those also of forrayne places: for which cause this Magistrate was called by the name of New, in regarde that after the commonwealth was once setled and established, the ci∣tie began to stretch and enlarge her dominion ouer the maine land of the prouince of Venetia, which as though it had neuer beene seperated from the same, returned willingly with a franke and liberall good will. For as I shewed you in the beginning of this worke, the noblest sorte of people that inhabited the countrey of Venetia, flying the barbarous crueltie of forraine nations, & the generall deuastation of all Italie, did get themselues in∣to these lakes of ours, and then did lay the first founda∣tion Why the City was first cal∣led Venetia.of this most opulent and flourishing citie, calling it by the name of Venetia, to leaue thereby a remem∣brance vnto their posteritie, that there in the same were ioyntly together assembled the chiefe prime and flower of the nobilitie of all the cities of the territories of Vene∣tia: so that in short space, when the rule and empire therof began infinitly to increase, one Magistrate could not serue for the dispatch both of forraine and domesti∣call causes: and therefore this New Magistrate was The New col ledge of the forty ciuile iudges.ordayned, and likewise the New Colledge of the forty: into whose courtes are brought the appeales from the indgementes of such forrayne magistrates as haue go∣uernment abroade: where being throughly handled and discussed, they are finally ended and concluded. The manner and forme of proceeding in this colledge,
is such in all points (as before I told you) is obserued of the olde Auditors, and the councell of the forty ciuill The councel of fortie for causes onely within the citie.Iudges, concerning causes within the cittie: onely this is added to the authoritie of the new Auditors, that in any matter brought vnto them by appeale, so the same exceed not the summe of fortie crownes, they may o∣uerrule the former iudgement, or abrogate it, or allow it eyther in whole or in part, as shal seeme best vnto them, prouided, that they do all agree in one opinion: which The causes of strangers soo∣ner dispatch∣ed then those of the citizens.course was thought fit to be ordayned, to the end that forrayners and strangers (of whome according to the preceptes of many great Philosophers there is especiall regarde to bee had) should not be molested and lin∣gred off with long delayes, but quickly come to an ende of their suites. This priuiledge the olde Audi∣tors haue not: for they of necessity must eyther whol∣ly allow the iudgement, or els vtterly cancell and make voide the same, and whereas the new (as I said) may, leauing the rest, meddle onely with parte of the cause, they must either embrace the whole entire cause, or els vtterly leaue it vnmedled withall. So that by this means thesuites of strangers are sooner ended & determined, then the causes of the citizens, though through the sut∣telty of Aduocates and Lawyers (who leaue nothing vnattempted, how farre soeuer the same be from right) processes and suites are sundry times drawen out to an infinite length: as in all places it is vsuall, where iudge∣mentes are not rashly pronounced, but leasurely and considerately at appointed times. Now (in a manner) haue we expressed the whole form which is vsually obserued in iudgements, it remai∣neth that we briefly speak somwhat of those magistrates
who first of all do giue sentence in causes of the Citie, & Sixe seuerall kindes of Iudges.from whom the appeales & prouocations are brought to the old Auditors, and to the councell of the fortie: of these Iudges there are six seueral courts, diuided ac∣cording to the qualitie of the causes and of the persons. For eyther the suites are about marchandise, or matters pertayning thereunto, or about houses or groundes that are within the Lakes, or about possessions and landes that are on the Continent, or els about other contractes, or bargaines: as for the persons that con∣tend, they are eyther citizens or strangers, or one with another strangers and citizens together: or the con∣trouersie is betweene orphelins, or els moued at the suit of the widdowes, for the recouery of their dower after the death of their husbands. Lest therefore there might fall out a confusion among iudgements of so dif∣ferent kindes, to the end that the one should not bee a disturbance or hinderance to the other, there were ap∣pointed seuerall Courtes of iudgement, in so much that as farre forth as possible it might bee, euery one according to the quality of his businesse might know the proper and peculiar Iudge of his controuersie: for Iudges of the properties.whatsoeuer differences arise about houses, groundes, or leases, situated or lying within the boundes of Ve∣nice (that is, being within the lakes) are all determined by those that are called Iudges of the properties, to whose Courtes also widdowes haue recourse in de∣mandes of their dower, after the death of their hus∣bandes. This name and appellation of properties was first giuen them, because our auncestors did take those thinges to be properly their owne, which were seated within the Lakes, as not being easie to bee transferred
to the dominion of other maysters: as for such goods as they had vpon the Continent, whether they were landes or houses, in regarde that they lay open to vi∣olence, and might in dispight of their maysters suffer rapine and spoyle, they called by the name of moue∣ables: if then the controuersie arise concerning any possession vpon the maine landes, for redresse thereof recourse is to be had to the Iudges of the Procurators: Iudges of the procurators.vnder whome the matters of Orphelins that are yet vnder gardians are handled, for among the Venetians both gardians and tutors were wont to be called Pro∣curators. If the contention and strife do any way con∣cerne Merchantes or matter of merchandise, then for the decision of those causes are there certaine peculiar Iudges or Consuls of the merchants.Iudges, called properly Iudges or Consuls of the mar∣chantes. These doe in their Iudgements vse a speedier dispatch then any other of the ciuill magistrates: which was so ordayned, to the ende that marchantes, whose affaires might otherwise receyue great detriment and hinderance, with lingering and delayes might not bee deluded or entertayned with long expectation of their Iudges of strangers.right. But if the question bee betweene straungers, or that if any citizen will sue a stranger that commeth to lodge in Venice for some fewe dayes, those Iudges must then bee repayred vnto that are appoynted to heare the causes of straungers, and haue thereof their proper nomination and tytle. But all other causes of sales, bargaines, or contractes, by which any citizen pretendeth eyther breach of couenant or duenesse Iudges of re∣questes.of debt, are referred to the Iudges of requestes, who serue in steade of the Mayor or Pretor of the Citie.
There are besides certaine small thinges, whose iudge∣ment Iudges of the moueables.and determination is committed to certaine offi∣cers, that are called Iudges of the moueables. Likewise there is another kinde of magistrate, whose office is, if any thing happen to bee founde, that had layne long hidden, or els beene lately lost, to iudge and determine Iudges of things that are found.whether the same ought to belong to the commō trea∣sure, or to any priuate man, or els to him whose chaunce it is to find it, all things of the like kind and nature being vnder the compasse of his authoritie and iudgement. Hauing expressed the seuerall kinds and manners of Magistrates that haue charge of common trea∣sure.iudgements, we wil now passe ouer to those magistrates that haue charge ouer the common chamber or treasu∣rie, and the receipt & employment of the publike reue∣new. These perchance may seeme to some body more in number then is conuenient, and that a few might as sufficiently discharge the whole businesse pertaining to the treasure: but here they must marke, that our fa∣thers omitted no kinde of heedfulnesse to preuent all fraude & deceipt in the administration of their publike treasure, supposing the same to bee the very fountayne whence the other parts of the commonwealth receiue their nouriture and sustenance, and likewise grow to an exceeding weakenesse and empouerishment by the drying vp and decay therof, in so much that they made a solemn decree, that what citizen soeuer should be cō∣uicted of hauing abused or defrauded the commō trea∣sure, shold be to al posterity defamed with a perpetuall note of dishonor: and the same perpetualy euery yeare should to his eternal shame be renued. For vpō a certain appointed day the great councel is solemnly assembled,
and there in a publike oration made by one of the Ad∣uocators, all such as haue beene conuicted of this crime as named with titles of reproach, to the end that the shame and infamie of so foule a fact may neuer growe out of date or be forgotten. The magi∣strates who haue charge o∣uer the trea∣sure are of two sortes. But returning to the purpose: The magistrates who haue charge ouer the Treasure are of two sortes, as like∣wise is the treasure it selfe, for eyther it consisteth of the publike rentes, reuenewes, and tributes, or else when great and important occasions shal so require the same, is raised of taxes and subsidies that are leuied according to the abilitie of the citizens: which oftentimes hap∣neth, when warres with which our city hath been much afflicted, do grow vppon vs eyther by sea or land, as when the Turke incrochingly assaileth our dominions, whose mighty puissance and formidable attempts as∣well against vs, as against the whole commonwealth of Christendome, wee alone not without exceeding charge and detriment haue resisted and kept at a baye many yeares, or else when christian princes not broo∣king the greatnes of the Venetian empire, haue con∣spired against the same, as in the fifteenth yeare before this, in manner all the greatest princes of christendome were strongly linked, leagued and confederated against vs: but God be thanked: their endeuours were with∣stoode, and our affaires though for a while declining, were yet at length restored into their former estate & flourishing erected grearnesse. Seeing then that this common treasure consisteth of two kindes, two likewise are the kinds of magistrates to whose charge they are committed. The one for the subsidies leuied of the people: and the other for
the common rents and tributes: These tributes are le∣uied eyther of goods transported out of the City, or els of such as are brought into the same: others the like al∣so are collected and gathered out of those other citties that are vnder the Venetian dominion. The tributes Tolles, and customes of the citie, aswell through the great aboundance of marchandize, and infinite assem∣bly of marchants, as also the innumerable multitude of people that dwell within the same, are farre greater then a man would imagine, and as the kinds of these matters & marchandize are diuers, so likewise are the officers ouer them instituted & ordained, as it best seemed vnto thē, to whose supremecharge & superintendance they belong to acquaint you with the particularities & pe∣culiar offices of euery one of which would rather breed a vaine and werisome tediousnes, then any necessarie or pleasing delight, for which cause I thought it not amisse to ouerslippe those magistrates, whose offices are not of continuance, but are onely instituted vppon occasions. In summe the chiefest point belonging to all these officers is to be heedefull that no parte of this commō treasure be embezeled, misemployed or care∣lesly regarded, all controuersies likewise arising about this money, are by them iudged and determined, so soo e as they haue gathered in their mony, they carie The Gouer∣nour of the publike rents.the same to the gouernours of the publike Rents: for so is this magistrate called, to whose presidence this matter is committed: which because it is a very great and a very honorable charge, the same is not wont to be giuen, but vnto the noblest citizens, which to the end they should the more willingly of themselues de∣sire, or at least not refuse the same, being profered, as
the burthen and care there of, is great and weightie: so are there thereunto many both profitable and ho∣norable The creation of the vnder Officers be∣longeth to the gouernours the common Treasure.authorities annexed for the creatiō of all such vnder officers, as are paid out of the common treasure, as Serieants, Somners, Purseuants, Ordinarie gardes, and therest of that kinde, lyeth wholy in their power, whome hauing satisfyed and payd, they bring the rest The Treasur∣ers of the Chamber of the City▪that remaineth to the Treasurer, at the Chamber of the City: to which magistrate finally is brought the whole summe of the common money collected ey∣ther within or without the towne, by whatsoeuer of∣ficer or treasurer, and they do againe imploy the same vpon publike vses, according to the order and directi∣on of the Senate: keeping a Register both of their re∣ceipts and paymentes, which office because it requi∣reth a painefull trauell and continuall diligence, the same is wont to be giuen to the yonger sort of the no∣bilitie, prouided alwayes that they be such, whose sin∣cerenesse and integrity of life do no way degenerate from the noblenesse of their stocke, to the ende that the publike mony bee not priuately misemployed, and these treasurers of the City haue in manner as greate authority in the Senate as the other lawfull Senators: Peculiar Offi∣cers appointed ouer such mo∣ny as is leuied by taxation.but as for the money which in the necessities and di∣stresses of the commonwealth is leauied of the citizens by way of taxation: though at length the same come as to the treasurer of the town Chamber, yet are there peculiar and proper officers thereunto assigned some∣times vpon an occasion of collecting a summe of mo∣ney, the Senate maketh a decree for the raising thereof without any clause of restirution, interest, or vtilitie to returne backe to those of, whome it is leuied, which
happeneth neuerthelesse very seldome, for commonly, or rather alwaies, vnlesse extreame occasion require the contrarie, the Senate (as their chiefest care is di∣rected to the generall good of the commonwealth:) so also haue they a most especiall and singular regarde of the particular estate of the citizens. The summe that is to be leuied being determined, & time appointed for the payment thereof; euery one bringeth in as much thereof, as he was rated at, which is exacted and gathered in, by the gouernors of the rentes, and by them brought to the Treasurers of the Chamber. But oftentimes vpon these taxations of money the Senate limites and appointes a time for restitution thereof vnto the Citizens, with some al∣lowance Interest allow∣ed vnto the ci∣tizens for such money as is leuied of them.also of profite, and interest for the same, and to that ende are there certaine rentes and determinate tributes assigned and made ouer, but afore our time the Senate sundrie times were wont to make a decree concerning this exacted summe of money that there should not be made any mention of restitution, nor a∣ny time thereunto appointed, vnlesse the same should be for the generall good and benefite of the common wealth, onely the magistrate, which was called presi∣dent of the lones, and as yet retayneth that name, re∣corded President of the Lones.in a booke, the seuerall summe contributed by euery particularr cittizen, and in the meane time till the same were repayed, there were allowed fiue crownes in the hundred, to euery one of those that had beene taxed, and thereunto were sundrie rentes appointed, so that in those ancient warres it was an ea∣sie matter to leuie mony by this manner of taxation, and surely in my opinion it was a thing very iust and
reasonable, that somewhat should bee againe restored vnto them out of the common reuenew, that had in the necessarie times of the common wealth, spent and empayred their substance: for as the partes ought to haue regarde to the safety of the whole, so in naturall reason also ought the whole to defend and preserue the partes, in asmuch as may bee from all inconueni∣ence and wrong, and to participate with them some part of the common nouriture, thereby to restore & enharten them, but in our time this debt of leuied mo∣ny was so excessiue and great, that the very interest thereof, after the rate I spake of, amounted to three hundred thousande Crownes by the yeare, which payment being of late, by reason of the extreame ne∣cessities and dangerous warres, wherewith the com∣monwealth was enuironed, withholden, and kept backe, now finally, some foure yeare since, there was a statute and decree enacted by the Senate, (the mo∣tioners and perswaders thereof being Dominico Tre∣uisano, Andrea Gritti Duke Venice.a graue and honorable Councelor, and Andrea Gritti, a Senator of singular prudence and integrity, who now to the generall contentment and exceeding happines of our commonwealth, wee acknowledge for our Duke and Prince) that there should not thence forwarde be any mention made of paying any yeare∣ly interest, neither that any suits, kinde of subsidy, or contribution shoulde thereafter be registred or en∣rolled in the common bookes, and yet least the citi∣zens should thinke themselues defrauded: it was pro∣uided that they should be paide their principall, and likewise the interest, due vntill the day of the decree,
for satisfaction of which they appointed out, not onely An Officer appointed for the payment of the rownes debtes.a great part of their tributes, but also the whole pos∣sessions belonging to the common wealth in the teri∣torie of Rouigo. The medling in which busines happe∣ned partly to my lot in regarde of an office that I then bare, instituted of purpose before our times to diminish and lessen the debts of the common wealth, or if it were possible, vtterly to extinguish them, of which I wil speak somewhat hereafter, and so a great part was discharged of those heauie and vnmeasurable debtes, with which the commonwealth was burthened, and likewise the estate of the priuate citizens, not left vnconuenientlie regarded, yet alwaies so that the generall good was first prouided for, and then the priuate, which order is dis∣cended euen to our times from our auncesters, from hand to hand. Now then to turne our speech thether againe where∣in we digressed. The Presidentes of the lones are those that do gather together the money wherein the Citti∣zens are taxed at such times as the commonwelth nee∣deth their helpe, of which when in their bookes they haue taken a particular note and reckoning, then finally they deliuer the same ouer to the Treasurer of the Chamber of the Citty, from whome it belon∣geth to their charge to exact such summes of money, as were yearely accustomed to be yeelded in steade of rent to the priuate Cittizens: and likewise to register vp in their bookes both the receipt and expence there∣of. But this money which by the Senates decree is leuied of the Cittizens, and is after a certaine time to bee restored vnto them againe, was wont both
to bee collected and repayed by a certaine peculiar Magistrate thereunto appointed: Now this office Officers that do seaze and sell the goods of those that do not at the time appoin∣ted pay the mony in which they are taxed.belongeth wholy to the Gouernours of the Rentes. There is also an other money-Magistrate not to bee omitted, to whose office it appertaineth to search, seaze, and to sell openly the goodes of such as do not at the time appointed pay the summe of mo∣ny at which they are taxed. There are also other money-Magistrates, that do seeke out the endebted Cittizens, and do aswell peruse the bookes of ac∣count of priuate men, as also those of the common welth, to the end that the treasurie and common welth may not any way bee defrauded, which for auoiding tediousnesse I will ouerpasse, because they are not of a∣ny moment, to that order and gouernement of our common wealth which I haue taken vpon mee to de∣scribe. Presidents o∣uer the coyne or mintmai∣sters. Besides these heretofore mentioned, there are also certain other magistrates, whose offices are of greate auaile, to the commoditie, quietnesse, honour, health, and happinesse of our Countrie, and therefore not to be ouerslipped in silence. First are the maisters of the coyne aswell golde, as siluer, the currant good∣nesse of which as yet entertaineth the willing trafique of straungers: so is it comfortable and commodious to the Citizens within themselues: then the corn∣maisters, and health maisters of Venice, both being Corn masters. Helth masters. Presidentes of the Arsenall.of great and exceeding consequence, as likewise are the worshipfull Presidentes of the Arsenall. Then are there certaine officers, such as among the Romains Aediles.were called Aediles, to whose care belongeth the
mending and repayring of the streetes and Bridges, and other the like matters of that kinde and office, ex∣ceedinglie requisite and necessarie in this common wealth of ours, and lastly the office of those whome Procurators.the Venetians call procurators, being of great dignity and singularly auailable to the City. Of the Presidents of the money or Mintmaisters I knowe not what I should say more, then that their chiefe charge and care is, that the gold and siluer be not coyned in any baser allay, then that which by the law is appointed, neither that the same beare a∣ny whit lesse weight then it should doe: which hath beene of vs all most religiously obserued, insomuch that the money of Venice is of great account, and runneth currant aswell among the barbarous Nati∣ons, as it doth in Christendome. For whereas all other Christian Princes in a manner, cause their mo∣ny to be stamped in a baser allay, to the end to make it stretch the farther: ours haue alwayes herein most constantlie retayned that dignitie which they recey∣ued of their auncesters. The magistrate that hath the charge for the prouision of corne is exceedingly necessarie to this city of Venice, because there being but a small quantitie of corne to be gathered out of the territorie of Venice, and the cittie being most populous, and round about encom∣passed with lakes, of necessitie there is greate care to bee had of these prouisions: least the people whose benefit and commoditie was so exceedingly of our an∣cesters respected through dearth and scarsity of corne, might fall into the extremitie of Famine. There
are therefore appointed three maysters or ouerseers of this matter of corne, whose Magistracie endureth six∣teene monthes: their office & charge is carefully to pro∣uide that the Citie bee neuer at any time afflicted with the scarcitie of corne, of which if at any time they stand in doubt, they presently repaire vnto the Duke, and to the Colledge of the Sages, and there the matter being well debated, doe at length determine what course is therein best to be taken. Sometimes there is a certaine rewarde and recompence out of the common treasure appointed to those that shall from farre countries trans∣port any corne to Venice. Sometimes they bargayne with merchantes for the vndertaking to bring by a cer∣tayne time such quantity of corne as they shall agree vpon to Venice, from out of forraigne regions, and for the same to be payed out of the publike treasure, which promise vnlesse the marchantes faithfully performe, they are by the senate amerced in a great summe of money. And whereas the commonwealth buyeth this corne deerely and at a great rate: it selleth the same a∣gaine to the common people very good cheape, and at a small price, suffring sometimes therein a great and ex∣ceeding losse. There are besides this many other excellent lawes and decrees concerning this matter of corne, which if I should perticularly rehearse, I should digresse farther from my purpose then were fit. Now followeth that Magistrate to whose prouidence and care all such thinges as tend to the health and hole∣somenesse of the citie do appertain. His chiefest office is to foresee, that there come not into the citie any con∣tagious infection, which if at any time it happen to
creepe in (as sometimes it chanceth) then to take such diligent and carefull order, that in as much as may bee the same come not to spreade any further. To which ende there are certaine goodly commodious houses built in the lakes three miles off from the citie, and ad∣ioyning neer vnto them there are gardens of great plea∣sure, into which houses if any of the people fall sicke, he is presently conueyed with his whole familie: and those that haue had any cōuersation with him that is so fallen sicke, to the end they infect not others, must also (lea∣uing their owne mansions) be remoued to other pub∣lique houses built to the same vse, but in a part without the citie quite contrarie to the other, where they are constrained to remaine the space of fortie daies: if du∣ring which time they continue sound and well, then they are suffred to returne to the citie and to their dwelling places. There is also a great care had of their housholde stuffe, least by the contagion thereof, any one should get infection. This Magistrate likewise hath a care that there bee not any stinking or rotten meate, or any other vnholesome thing solde, that might any way offend or bee noysome to the health of the Ci∣tie. Finally his onely care is to preuent infection and sicknesse, and to preserue purenesse and health within the citie: This office was instituted not long before our time; whereas before the cittie was sundry times so mortally afflicted with the plague, that whole fami∣lies flying the infection thereof, leauing their proper habitations, forsooke the towne, & went to the next countries vpon firme lande. But since the creation of this new magistrate (Gods goodnesse be thanked) there
hath not beene (in a manner) any pestilence at all: though sometimes (as in such a maruellous concourse of people out of all partes can hardly bee auoided) some houses haue beene infected: but by the diligence of this magistrate, and especially Gods fauour assisting him therein: the disease hath not taken roote, nor been suffred to spread it selfe abroade. The gouern∣ment and manner of the Arsenall. Now we come to speake of the honourable gouern∣ment of our Arsenall: the same being a singular orna∣ment not onely to Venice it selfe, but generally (such is the statelinesse and glorie thereof) an honour and dignitie to all Italy, because it is a matter of infinite magnificence and maiestie, and worthy of all admi∣ration. The Arsenall is built on that side of the citie, which of all others is neerest to the maine sea, hollowed out into three bosomes, or to speake more properly, into three diuided entries, into euerie of which the sea en∣treth by one onely gate, the same being so large, that it is capable of the greatest Gallies▪ This gate is for∣tified on each side with two strong Towers, which are ioyned together with a mightie drawbridge, and a huge percullisse, which are neuer opened but vpon the occasion of letting Gallies out or in. There is no other passage to go into the inner partes of the Arse∣nall, but onely by this gate. The first bosome or en∣trie within the same, though it be the least of the three, yet notwithstanding it is very great and spacious: being roofed, couered and tyled round about on euery side in manner of certain vaults, vnder which the gal∣lies that are come from sea do repose til new ocasion fall out of employing them safe & free from the annoyance
eyther of wind or weather, so that they continue many yeares sound and good: likewise vnder these vaultes doe they build their new Gallies, and mende and make vp their old: a worke surely of great goodlinesse and glory, and most fitte and commodious for the mainte∣nance of a nauie. Next this bosome or gully there is an inwarder maruellously great and large, ordered round of euery side with such vaultes as I spake of: of which vaultes you shall not see any one emptie: but in those that are wide two Gallies, and in the narrower one at least. The third, being not much inferior to the second in largenesse, was but a little before our time added to the two former, and is compassed about with goodly wals, and builded with many vaults, which though they bee not all as yet finished: yet dayly they are diligently in hande, about the ending and accomplishing thereof. There is onely one way by which men go from one to the other: and on the outside they are compassed all a∣bout with one wall, distinguished here and there with certaine towers, in the which there are nightly watches kept to preuent the daunger of fire, the treachery of any ill disposed person, or any other casualtie, whereby so goodly and excellent a worke might come to be spoy∣led or defaced. Within the walles are certaine roomes, replenished with all manner of Nauale instruments, & all kindes of artificers thereunto belonging, haue there their workehouses and shops. There great quantities of brasse are melted for the making of their artillerie: & likewise there are also made infinite prouisions of gun∣powder: so that within the Arsenall there wanteth not any thing which appertayneth to the affaires of the sea:
There you may beholde an infinite number of worke∣men, euery one exercising his owne particular trade & office. There are besides these certaine great and ample roomes, wherein there is alwaies readie an vnmeasura∣ble abundance of armour, weapons, and artillerie of all sorts: likewise of sailes, cables, tacklings, ankers, oares, and such like, euery kinde laide vp seperately by it selfe. In so much that when the senate shall determine to set forth a nauie, all thinges thereunto belonging are rea∣die in a moment. All these thinges and seuerall workes are vnder the authoritie of this Magistrate, of which I determined to speake: hee maketh choyce as well of the Carpenters, as of the smithes and tryers of met∣tall and all other kindes of workemen belonging to the businesse of the sea, hauing care that each of them per∣forme his businesse with diligence: for the payment of all which Nauale workes and other charges there∣unto belonging, there is mony deliuered vnto him out of the common treasure. The Colledges allowance being therein first demanded, and they made acquain∣ted with his reckonings. This magistrate, in the time of our auncestors was of singular reputation and ho∣nour: but in these times of ours the same is much di∣minished and of lesse estimation. In so much that when any great occasion happeneth, requiring extraordinary diligence and care, the senate electing certaine counsel∣lors of the grauest and best experimented sort, doth ap∣point the managing of those waighty sea businesse vn∣to them, appointing the others to be by them wholly directed.
Now last of all wee are to speake of the Procurators The procura∣tors of Saint Marke.of Saint Marke, being of all the other magistrates the greatest and most honourable next vnto the Duke. For their time of authoritie is not limited, but continueth during life. To this honour is also adioyned the per∣petuall dignitie and place of a Senator: and equall po∣wer of suffrages with the lawful Senators: and this they haue besides aboue all other magistrates, that where∣as the elder citizens doe not giue any preheminence of place to the other, but onely in certaine courtes the honour thereof is alwayes and in euerie place yeel∣ded to the Procurators: for in what Court or place soeuer they sitte, they are euer alike honoured with the highest place, as though they did in euerie place performe the office of the magistrate there presiding. Their office is to take vpon them the defence & tutor∣shippe of Orphelins, who being vnder age, and their fathers deade without making any will, haue not any tutor or ouerseer appointed them: for which cause this charge and office is neuer giuen to any, but to such as are throughly knowne to be of singular good conscience and integritie of life, and haue passed (in a manner) through all the other offices of the ci∣tie, without any touch of dishonour, and a generall approbation of an vncorrupted vertue: and so at length after their long seruice to the commonwealth, doe obtayne therein this great and principall dignity, which continueth with them during their liues. In times passed this office was of passing great and honourable estimation, not onely within Venice, but also in forrayne regions, in so much that not onely the
subiectes and neere borderers, but also forreners and strangers, made them by testament their executors, and put wholly into their hands the administration of their goodes, during the minority of their children. Like∣wise great summes of money are committed to them, to bee by their discretion dispensed and bestowed a∣mong the poore, so that in these times of ours great and mighty summes of money are committed to their fi∣delity, as well to the vse of Orphelins, and the poore, as otherwise. This office was at the first instituted, to the ende that the heritages and substances of those citizens that should eyther die in seruice of their coun∣trey, or in traficke of marchandise among forraine na∣tions, shoulde not bee by fraude misemployed or diuerted from their heires. This charge & confidence therefore is especially giuen to those, whose conscience, behauiour, and conuersation, a long approouedexperi∣ence hath allowed for excellent, & without exception. The addition of new pro∣curators from time to time. At the first beginning they were onely three that did exercise this office. Afterwarde vpon the increase of the citties greatnesse, three more were added vn∣to them, but their authoritie so diuided, that the old shoulde still retayne the charge of those pupilles and Orphelins which are on the farther side of the channel that runneth through the middle of the Citie, and the new to haue the gouernment & looking to of those that are on this side, halfe of the city belonging to the charge of the former three, and halfe to that of the later three. Besides these there are other three that are (as it were) patrons of the royal, sumptuous, and magnificent Tem∣ple of Saint Marke, vnder the protection of which blessed & holy Euangelist the commonwealth of Venice
being directed with excellent lawes, hath at length in∣creased into this greatnesse of empire, and of these last as of the noblest they all do take their name, and are cal∣led Procurers of Saint Marke. I will not at this pre∣sent say any thing of the gorgeous architecture of this Temple, nor of the abundance of beautifull marbles, nor of the multitude of goodly pillers, nor of the glori∣ous workes as well guilded & carued, as richly wrought in Porphire and Iasper stone, of which the whole roofe and pillers are made, yea and the very pauementes: because I thinke there are very fewe but haue seene the same, or at least hearde the fame of the magnificence thereof. These three Procurators haue charge conti∣nually to looke to the maintayning of this goodly Temple, and amending the decayes thereof, as also to the priests, to the end that diuine seruice may therein be said, according to the dignitie of our city, & the worthi∣nes of our blessed patrone & aduocate S. Marke. These therfore in my iudgement, beyond al other magistrates are most necessary and expedient in this prosperity and happinesse of our citie. The carefull vsage of the mint is a matter not lightly to bee esteemed, because nothing strengtheneth more the trafick & trading of a citie, then the purity & goodnes of the mony: neyther is the care∣full prouision of corne a matter of light regard: likewise the prouiding for the health of the citizens, & the repai∣ring of wayes, bridges and common buildinges are of∣fices of singular auaile, fitnesse and necessitie. All these thinges are (in a manner) common to euery o∣ther citie. But this other chiefly and aboue all the rest pertayneth vnto Venice, that is to say, the carefull proui∣sion and superintendance of sea matters & the defence
of Orphlins, because many of the Cittizens, aduen∣turing their liues abroad, eyther about the publike bu∣sines, or els in traficke of marchandize come to ende their dayes, and therefore these magistrates are ordai∣ned to the ende to defend their children from wrong, wherby it may appeare to those that shall considerate∣lie, and with an indifferent eye looke into the order, and gouernment of this common wealth, that our an∣cesters did not omit anything that might tend to the common benefite and good of their Countrie. The end of the fourth booke. The Fift Booke of the Magistrates and commonwealth of Venice. SEing that the whole forme, and order of the gouernment of our common wealth, is in manner of vs already expressed, and the office and order of the magistrates with∣in the Cittie, I thinke I shall not doe a thing vnpleasing, or vnfitte
for the matter I haue in hand, if I speake somewhat of The gouern¦ment abroadethe magistrates abroad, The gouern∣ment of the wates.those I meane that haue rule, and authority in such citties, as are vnder the subiecti∣on of the state of Venice, then of our militare charges & The offices of the citizens that are not nobly born.gouernments, and lastly of the offices of the other cit∣tizens, that are not within the order of nobilitie, which being declared and made manifest, I may and that as I trust without reprehension conueniently, and with the conclusion and shutting vp of this worke. The manner vsed by the Ve¦netians in go∣uerning such Cities as are vnder their subiection. Ouer the nobler Citties of the state, there are ap∣pointed foure magistrates, one onely Gouernour doth iustice to all, determining and sentencing all causes aswell ciuile as criminall: This Gouernour hath alwaies sitting with him in iudgement, men skil∣full in the lawes, whose counsell he vseth, though the whole authoritie rest in himselfe. Besides him there is a Captain generall commander ouer the souldiers of that territory, aswell those that are in garrison in the citties, as those that are encamped or lodged abroade in the countrie, ouer them hath the Gouernour no charge at all, but onely the Captaine generall, besides the care of the Castell, the walles and the Gates are committed to the Captaine likewise of the rentes and tributes, aswell of the citie, as of the whole countrie be∣longing vnto it, besides these, there is a Treasurer, or two that administreth, payeth, and recouerth the pub∣like money, and keepeth the bookes and register of the publike accountes: but he doeth not any thing with∣out the commandement of the Captaine and some∣times both of the Captain and the Gouernour, which manner of administration seemed much more fit, then if both the authority and the handling of the money,
should haue beene committed to one of them alone: whereby the publike treasure might much more easily haue beene embezeled and mispent: but the money that remaineth ouerplus, aboue the charges of the Pro∣uince, is carried to Venice, and deliuered to the Trea∣surers of the Citie, to whose office as I saide before the publike money is brought from all partes. The fourth magistrate of authority in euery principall Cittie, is the Liuetenant of the Castles, in some places there is but one, and in some more, they command ouer those soul∣diers that are in garrison of the Castles, and haue the charge of such weapons, victuall, artillery, and muni∣tion as are within the Castle: yet the Lieutenant hath not so absolute authority within the Castle, but that he is alwaies subiect to the commandement of the cap∣taine generall, to whose authority and power all things of that kinde are wholy attributed: but in lesser citties or townes there is no captaine generall: all thinges be∣ing there vnder commandement of the Gouernour. Likewise in such townes as are within the precinctes of greater citties, the Gouernour onely administreth right to the townsmen, and no other magistrate, though the Treasurers & captains haue also authority through∣out the whole Territory of the chiefe Citties, from all these Gouernours appeale may be brought to the new Auditors, sometimes also the Aduocators were wont to sit with the Gouernours vpon sentences of life and death: but because thereby iudgements were oftentimes delayde, and lewd persons in the meane time not punished, there was a lawe made by the colledge of the ten, that the Aduocators should not haue any farther authority in such iudgements as were
giuen by the gouernour, but that he should onely vse the aduise of such Doctors of law as before I said were to sit with him in iudgement. And this in my opinion already saide, may suf∣fice concerning the magistrates by whome our commō wealth is gonerned both abroade and at home But seeing there is aswell a reckoning to bee made of managing warres, as of maintaining peace, which whosoeuer wholy do reiect, cannot as Plato sayth in his Polytiques, long defend and maintaine themselues in freedome and libertie: But those that haue left vnto their posterity the true directions of a commonwealth, commended the vse of both, to the end that in times of warre, they should not bee vnfit for the exercises thereof, and that in peace they might liue in honest ex∣ercises vnder the lawes and statutes of their Country, so that alwaies the vertue and exercises of warre haue a reference to the studyes of peace, as being of the two the most excellent and desirable, for such is the verie force, working, and operation of nature it selfe in e∣uery thing, that first it should couet and seeke, that which is to it selfe conueuient, and then resist and de∣fend themselues from that which is contrarie there∣unto, which in all liuing creatures that are created, with any perfection of nature is easie to bee discerned: for there is none of them which wanteth a desire leading him to that which to his nature is most agreeable, and likewise there is adioyned to the same a force and abi∣litie to be angrie, which Plato placeth in the heart, to the end that through the stirring therof euery creature might be prone to resist and repell that which is to his nature noysome and contrarie, the first seedes then of
eyther of these partes being by nature placed in the mindes of men as being of all other creatures the most perfect: ought of ciuile men to be embraced, that they may bring forth the fruites of eyther effect, that is, both of warre and peace, which course was not neglected of our ancesters, howsoeuer to some it seeme otherwise: for though the citty being builded in the sea, and at the first for many years careles of extending their domini∣on and rule ouer the continent, did not apply them∣selues to land wars, yet did they with maruelous glory of successe bend themselues to warres by sea, atchiuing therewith many notable exploits, aswell in defence of their owne liberty, as in reuenge of iniuries done thē by their enemies, and many great and glorious deeds of the Venetians do yet remaine in ancient recorde, & many triumphes and victories wrested by sea, from fierce and puissant nations, whereby it is easie to con∣iecture of the mightinesse of the Venetians by sea in forepassed times, but in the end yeelding to the instāt petition of the oppressed bordering people, who could not endure the rapines and cruelties of seuerall tyrants, that had brought them into subiection, they sent for∣ces into the mayneland, and expelling the tyrants, did with an infinite applause and willingnes of the people receiue all those Prouinces of their olde consideration into their protection, as though they had neuer beene disunited thereby setting them free from out the serui∣tude of insolent strangers, which being the remainder & ofspring of those Barbarians, that had wrought that general deuastation in Italy, had then nestled themselues and helde the people in a most cruell and miserable bondage.
This increase therfore of dominion being added to the former greatnesse of the city, their desire and inde∣uour was not onely to comfort and cherish this new receiued people with wholesome and profitable lawes, but also to finde out meanes, whereby to maintaine and preserue their recouered freedome and tranquili∣tie: but the situation of their City being in the sea, on the other side vtterlie diuerted their mindes from wholy applying themselues to land wars, aswel through the inconueniency of the City thereunto, as also for the auoiding of ciuill disturbance and tumult, for of necessity those citizens: to whose lot the managing of these saide wars should haue befallen, might haue spent the greater parte of the yeare vpon firme land, aswell to ride and practise their horses, as also to inure and ex∣ercise themselues in sundry manners of skirmish, and kinds of fight: and withall for their better skill in mili∣tary and martiall affaires, it should haue beene neces∣sary for them, when occasion of employment wanted at home to frequent forrein warres, thereby aswell to confirm their courages, as to strengthen their bodies, and so to enable themselues in that function, for the ser∣uice of their country, whereas otherwise, without this kinde of exercise, they would haue beene vntill eyther to command as captaines, or to obey his scutchions. But now this their continual frequentation of the con∣tinent and diuorcement▪ as it were from the ciuile life, would without doubt haue brought forth a kinde of faction different and disioyned, from the other pea∣ceable Citizens, which parcialitie and diuision wold in time haue bred ciuile warres and dissentions within the City, I omit in the meane time to speake of those
high and ambitious thoughtes, that such would haue entertained, as did see themselues mighty in armes, & followed with affecting troupes of vnquiet souldiers, who according to the nature of men enclining still to the worse, might easily bee stirred to mischiefe, which The ouer∣throw of Rome procee∣ding through the mightines of her owne Cittizens.onely cause among the Romains (as many of their an∣cient histories do notably remember) wrought strange effectes in sundry of their Cittizens, prouoking them to disobey, and set at nought the lawes of the Senate, and their country, and finally Iulius Caesar exceeding the limites of all respect, to tyrannize ouer that com∣monwealth, to which hee did owe all duty and obe∣dience. To exclude therfore out of our estate the dan∣ger or occasion of any such ambitious enterprises, our auncesters held it a better course to defend their do∣minions vppon the continent, with forreyn mercena∣rie souldiers, than with their homeborn citizens, & to assigne them their pay and stipende out of the tributes and receipts of the Prouince, wherein they remayned: for it is iust, and reasonable, that the souldiers shoulde be maintained at the charge of those in whose defence they are employed, and into their warfare, haue many of our associates been ascribed, some of which haue at∣tained to the higest degree of commandement in our Straungers receiued into the Venetian nobility Bartholomeo Coglione cap∣tain generall of the Vene∣tian armie.army, & for the exceedingnes of their deserts been en∣abled, with the title of citizens & gentlemen of Venice, amongst which the name of Bartholomeo Coglione of Bergamo is yet honorable among vs, who after many great exploits & prosperous successes being captaine general of our army, & hauing amplified & enlarged the boundes of the Venetian Empire, was in eter∣nall
memory of his great and glorious actions hono∣red of our commonwelth, with his statue on horseback, set vp and erected in the fayrest and goodliest place of our Citty. The Cittizens therefore of Venice, for this only cause are depriued of the honors belon∣ging to warres by land, and are contented to transferre them ouer to straungers: to which ende there was a lawe solemnely decreede, that no Gentleman of Ve∣vice should haue the charge and commaundement of aboue fiue and twentie souldiers, though the same law hath not beene in these times of ours altogether ob∣serued but through the course of custome in a manner abrogated, by reason of the many and sundrie warres, wherewith we haue beene encombred, so that nowe when wee haue any warres by land, there are some of Legates or proueditors.our Gentlemen sent into the Armie, who therein doe beare office and authority, while the warre endu∣reth, as namely, the Treasurers, and Legates, who neuer stirre from the side of the Captaine Gene∣rall of our Armie, who is alwaies a straunger, which hath no authority to doe or deliberate any thing with∣out the aduice of the Legates. The warre being en∣ded, eyther Magistrate returneth home, giuing vppe his authority, and putting himselfe into order, and this is wholy the manner of the Venetians warfare by land. But for warres by sea and nauigation, both our citie is much more thereunto opportune and cō∣modious, as also our people much more thereunto by nature addicted and enclined, for our Citty lying seated in the sea, needeth not greatlie feare any harme from forreyne land armies, and as for it selfe to haue
fostred or nourished forces to send vnto lande warres, thereby to wrong or prouoke the bordring people, that had not onely beene vniust, but also very incommodi∣ous: onely from sea therefore was their daunger, and the same great, if they should not haue beene through∣ly furnished with meanes of defence. Therefore did the Citie turne all their care to strength and puissance by sea, trayning vp their youth, & framing their whole manner of life thereunto. The educati∣on of the Ve∣netian gen∣tlemen. For the education of their gentlemen hath alwayes beene such, that from their infancie till such time as the heares of their beards beginne to appeare, they should be vnder the tutorship of schoolemaysters, and instru∣cted in learning according to their capacities: and from thence forward (except some fewe wholly addicted to some profession of learning) they shoulde apply them∣selues to nauigation, being thereunto (as it were) euen drawen by their owne inclination and nature. Many do saile into farre regions, as well by trafique to increase their substance, as also by experience to gain the know∣ledge of the gouernment, lawes, conditions & customes of other countries. Many put themselues into the gal∣lies of warre, there enuring and practising their bodies to labour, and their minds to the knowledge of the ex∣cellent arte of Nauall discipline, in which the Venetians haue (as I say alwaies) beene worthily renowned. And there is an ancient law, continuing euen till these times of ours in force and vigor, that there should be a yeare∣ly Encourage∣ment for yong gentlemen to to frequent the sea.stipend allowed out of the common treasure to two young men of the nobilitie in euery armed galley, one∣ly thereby to breed in them a skilfulnesse in matters per∣tayning to the sea: for the better attayning to the which
there are ordinarily certaine offices assigned vnto them, in the exercise of which they do both profit themselues, and become better enabled to the discharge of greater matters. But to euery of the greater gallies there are These as I suppose are those which they call Galleasses.commonly assigned eight young men of the nobilitie, with a yearely great allowance and stipend, eyther out of the common or priuate mens treasure, accordingly as those Gallies are destinated eyther to the warres or marchandise, and this to no other end, but onely to ac∣custome them to sea seruices: it is also ordayned by a law hauing principall relation to the common vtilitie, that euery priuate merchant shall in the ship wherewith he trafiqueth, allow a yearly pensiō to one or two yong gentlemen, according to the burthen and abilitie of his ship. To which young men is also granted a liberty & priuiledge that they may within the galleyes of bur∣then, or shippes of priuate men, to which they are assig∣ned, carrie a certaine quantity of marchandise, without paying for the lading thereof any custome or tolle, & if they haue not, or will not carry any themselues, they may sel and passe ouer their right to do the same, to any other that they shall thinke good: wherein there was not onely a regard had to the exercise of the youth, but also to the pouerty of many of the meaner citizens that are in any sorte distressed: so that any man may easily perceyue, that the institution of our youth to warlike exercises was not (as some do suppose) neglected of our auncestors, but that there were two hundred yong men of the nobilitie at least, trayned vp in these shippes and Gallies at other mens charges: and besides there was not any of the gentlemen, but that was eyther brought vp to learning, or els to this seafaring and maritime dis∣cipline
benefiting thereby not onely their country, but also sundry times exceedingly increasing their wealths and substance. These ancient lawes and goodly institutions do still continue euen till this time of ours, though sundry young men, being since the increase of our dominion corrupted eyther with ambition, or ryot, haue neg∣lected their countrie customes, and withall the num∣ber of citizens is so increased, that through these late afflictions of the warre, and the many charges growing vpon them, there are many more fallen into pouertie, then by the benefite of this law may bee sufficiently re∣lieued: for such is in all worldly thinges the course of nature, that nothing may bee among men perpetuall. But all thinges howsoeuer they seeme at the first per∣fectly and well ordained, yet in course of time nature still slyding to the worse, they had neede to be mended and renewed, euen as a mans bodie satisfied with his dinners appetite, will not yet maintaine his health, vn∣lesse it be seconded with a supper: so in euery thing there must be a reliefe and reparation added to the wea∣ring and alwaies downe declining course of nature, of which remedy herein also (if it please God) we wil haue regard: so that there may not any necessary prouision be wanting in this commonwealth of ours. But hither∣to of these thinges: now we will speake of those offi∣cers and magistrates that haue charge at sea ouer our shippes and nauies. This Captain they call So∣pracomit. Euery Galley being furnished, and in order for the warres, hath for Captaine thereof a Gentleman of the state, who hath power and authoritie ouer all that are in the Galley, saue onely that hee cannot punish with
death: euen as in land warres a captayne or a Coronell hath authoritie ouer those that are vnder their compa∣nies or regiments: so hath this Captayne of the Galley ouer the mariners and all thinges that are in the Galley, or tending to the prouision thereof. Gallies set forth by the Venetians to cleere the sea from pyrates. The Venetians do yearely arme forth certain Gallies, though there bee not any other necessitie, yet to make the sea safe and secure from pyrates, and to defend from their oppression honest merchantes that crosse the seas about their businesse, without doing wrong to any man. Besides these Captains of the Galleyes, there is a Le∣gate The Legate or lieuetenant of the nauie.ouer the whole nauie, who hath full and whole authoritie ouer the same, and ouer the particular Cap∣taines of euery Galley. He (as a Lieutenant generall of the armie, if the Captayne generall bee not present) hath power of life and death, and authoritie to direct the nauie whether it shall please him. This magistrate is commonly created in time of peace, and hath in his handes the charge of the Gallies of war: but if the occasions of the commonwealth doe so re∣quire, and that there be a great nauie indeede to bee set out, then there is appointed & preposed ouer the whole nauie a Captaine generall with high and preheminent A Captain ge∣nerall ouer the nauy in manner like vnto the Ro∣main Dictatorauthoritie not onely ouer the same, but also ouer all ma∣ritime prouinces in manner as great, as that the Romain Dictator was wont to haue, saue onely that this in all things obeyeth the authority of the Senate, and the de∣crees of the commonwealth. Neuertheles his power is singularly great, as wel ouer the nauy, Legates, captains and Lieuetenants of the same, as also ouer all gouernors and magistrates, that haue gouernment or superinten∣dence
in any of the Islandes or maritime places: in so much that when the Captaine generall of the nauie shall come to any Citie, the cleargie is presently to meete him with solemnitie, and the keyes of the gates and castels are to be deliuered vnto him. The authori∣tie of all the other gouernors for that time ceaseth: and whosoeuer in whatsoeuer cause may appeale from any other magistrate to the Captaine generall: who onely if it shall so please him, may administer iustice, dispose of the publike money, and alone himselfe exercise the office and authority of all the rest. There is among the Venetians no magistrate of higher power, and there∣fore hee, but seldome and vpon most vrgent occasions created: for not rashly but vpon most waighty & groū∣ded consideration, is this mighty dignitie, inuesting a priuate citizen with so great and absolute an authority committed to any one. No General or Captaine may returne into Venice with armed hand. Heere that law is not to be omitted, by which it was ordayned, that no Generall, Legate, or Captaine of a nauie may enter into the citie of Venice with his armed Gallies, no not vpon his returne homewarde: but pre∣sently vpon his arriuall at Histria (which prouince is a hundred miles distant from Venice) hee is to deliuer vnto the mariners their stipend and pay, and there to dismisse them, and thence the Gallies are wont to bee brought vnto Venice by some fewe, and to bee placed in the Arsenall vnder the vaultes built for that purpose, where they are preserued from the iniurie eyther of winde or weather: But now this lawe is not wholly obserued in sorte as it was of our auncestors ordayned. Wee haue (in a manner) already reckoned vp all the sortes of magistrates to whome our auncestors haue
added as a crowne or toppe, those which by proper ap∣pellation deriued from the Greeke, were wont to bee Syndiks or Reuiditors: in Latine they call them Recognitores. So that we may and not vnfitly call them, I think, Ouerseers, or Examiners.called Sindiks: we by a new name, but perchance more fit to expresse their office, do call them Reuiditors. These are wont euery foure or fiue yeares to be created, and to bee sent into the countries vnder our dominion, as well vpon the firme land, as also the Islandes and mari∣time places, and there to looke into, and examine the doings of such magistrates and gouernors as haue there authority vnder vs: vpon whome they vse in manner that authority of correction, as is attributed to the Ad∣uocators. For as Aristotle wisely sayeth: They that beare rule, vnlesse they depend of others, doe (such is the euill sway and bent of euerie mans nature) hardly discharge their office well. We haue now reckoned vp and made an ende of all those offices belonging to Gentlemen, by whome the commonwealth of Venice doth gouerne eyther abroad or at home, it remaineth that we shew you the manner whereby our most prudent auncestors haue retayned the common and meaner people in dutie: a matter surely strange and scarcely credible, that the people being so many yeares depriued of the publique go∣uernment, did neuer yet refuse nor vnwillingly sup∣port the gouernment of the nobilitie, neyther yet did euer attempt any thing whereby the forme of the com∣monwealth might be altered, and they receyued into the fellowshippe of rule, but haue alwayes hetherto faithfully loued and willingly obeyed the Nobilitie. But now whosoeuer, besides the situation of our Citie (being in deede most opportune and commodious to maintayne a commonwealth) will consider our mode∣ration
& temperance in gouernment shall find that the people hath not beene wholly reiected, but receiued into such offices & charges, as might be committed vn∣to them without detriment or hinderance of the gene∣rall good: and that there hath beene in this common∣wealth of ours that temperature vsed, that both elder & later commonwealthes haue wanted, the most parte of which were continually disquieted with ciuill dissenti∣ons & popular seditious tumults: & lastly by them tur∣ned vp side downe & ouerthrowen: whereas in this ci∣tie of ours there was neuer any such sedition or vprore of the people, For as I said in the beginning it was ne∣cessarie and fitte for the true and perfect institution of a commonwealth, to exclude the common people from the gouernment thereof, wherein our ancestors haue not onely followed the authoritie & opinion of many great philosophers, but also imitated Sesastris that most ancient lawmaker of the Aegyptians, who as Aristotle The opinion of Sostrates the ancient lawmaker of the Egyptiansalleadgeth in his Politiques, woulde haue them that are to defende the commonwealth with armes, or to consult vpon the common good thereof, or to sit in ex∣ercise of iustice, to be in their kinds distinguished from husbandmen, & marchants, & those that do liue by me∣chanicall occupations. Neuerthelesse easily might this institution ouerthrow the commonwealth, vnlesse that temperature bee thereunto adhibited which our most wise and foresightfull auncestors haue vsed. First therefore among the Venetians this alwaies hath beene most constantly obserued, that iustice should be equally administred to all, and that it be not lawfull for any how great soeuer, to doe wrong or iniurie to the least of the lower or meanest people, in so much
that it hath alwaies beene held as a haynous abhomina∣tion, & detestable sacriledge, for any gentleman to mis∣vse Plebeyan one of the commō people.a Plebeian: which if at any time any hath rashly, or vnaduisedly presumed to do, he neuer escaped scotfree: and so much more grieuous was his punishment as hee himselfe was greater in degree and estimation. Be∣sides, there is not any thing more carefully prouided for by the Senate, then that there may bee plentie of corne & of all other things that are necessary eyther for the sustenance or safetie and healthinesse of the peo∣ple: in so much that to preserue the people from want and famine, the common treasure is sometimes ex∣ceedingly spent & wasted: which any man may easily perceyue, that shall attentiuely marke that which is be∣fore expressed, concerning the presidents of corne, and the healthmaisters of the citie. And commonly all peo∣ple do require this at the hands of their rulers, that they may liue cōmodiously & in plenty, & that they be not subiect to the oppressions and iniuries of those that are mightier then themselues: which when they haue attai∣ned, they go on with their busines secure & carelesse of the rest: of which there was not any thing omitted of our ancestors pertaining to those two pointes: But ma∣ny things besides added, whereby the commodities of The reliefe of the poorer sort.the people are exceedingly respected, and their pouer∣tie carefully relieued, especially of such that eyther pre∣sently do, or at any time haue employed themselues in honest trades of vse and seruice to the commonwealth, and grow at length eyther by age or weakenesse vnable to perseuer therein: for in Venice there are built infinite many houses fitly and commodiously, which are frankely giuen to such kindes of men, wherin during
their liues they may liue and their Families without charge: besides within the Arsenall (which is so am∣ple and large, that it representeth the shew of another towne) there is a determinate stipend and yearly allow∣ance giuen to a great multitude of men vnable eyther through age, impotencie, or weakenesse to doe anie worke, onely in regard, that when in their better times they were able, they had imployed their labour in do∣ing seruice to the common wealth, likewise by an an∣cient statute it is ordained, that in all bargaines of buy∣ing and selling of rich marchandize, the one and the The releefe of poor mariners.other, that is both the buyer and the seller, do pay ac∣cording to the quantitie of the summe, a certaine price which is deuided among poore mariners, that hauing spent their time in that exercise, are through olde age vnable anie longer to continue therein. But now besides these good institutions and means to retain the common people in duty, there are also certaine lawes, which were as me seemeth established with exceeding wisedome of our auncesters; such as thereby both the peoples ambition, and desire of ho∣nour being a humor inseparably possessing the minds of men, may be throughy satisfied, and yet the gouern∣ment of the Nobilitie no way disturbed. The whole people are deuided into two partes, the one of the honester & best respected sort, the other of the very base common people, as mechanicall, & handi∣craftes men, and such like whome Aristotle in his poli∣tiques The people di∣uided into two sorts or kindestermeth to be in steade of publike seruantes, ey∣ther of these in my opinion are both fitly and commo∣diously prouided for, because to this meaner people, who of nature are rather intentiue to gaine then to
The people di¦uided into cō∣panies fraterni¦ties. honour, there are also granted certaine meane degrees, and dignities: for they are deuided into so many com∣panies as there are seuerall trades and occupations, and euery company hath certaine peculiar lawes, vnder which they are in the exercise thereof directed and go∣uerned, ouer euery of these cōpanies there are chosen by suffrage of the whole company, certaine, that they may well be called as it were maisters of that company: for by their commandement many thinges are prescri∣bed, and many small controuersies by their arbitrement ended, whence it commeth, that all such artificers as can once attaine to that honour, do exceedingly con∣tent and please themselues therewith, and do thinke themselues not smally aduanced when they once are come so far, that they are by the rest of their conditiō & company thought worthy of that preheminence, there are besides in euery Company certaine other Officers elected, though inferior to the maisters thereof, yet notwithstanding of good credite, and much respec∣ted among the rest, in some sort therefore you see that this desire of honour, which seemeth to be setled e∣uen in the mindes of the lowest and meanest people, is satisfied and prouided for. The other better kinde of people obtaineth also in the Citty of Venice, a better and more honorable place, enioying certaine particu∣lar offices and decrees, of especiall reckoning and ac∣count, into which no gentleman may be admitted, though some of them be such that aswell for the com∣moditie, The office of the Secretariesas title of honour thereunto belonging, they might beseeme any Gentleman of Venice, the office of the Secretaries is honest, and of great regard, they sit at the tribunals with euery magistrate, the same is onely
geuen to plebeians, and not to any gentleman, which though it be not honorable, yet it is of good respect & estimation, for to their fidelity and carefulnes are com∣mitted all the publike bookes and registers, wherein all both publike & priuate matters are contained, of which charge and office whosoeuer is accounted worthy, is both reputed to be a man honest and industrious, and much regarded in euery place, where he commeth, and withal their allowance frō the cōmonwelth is such, that they haue not only means to mantain their families, but also to amplifie their substance, those also that are secre∣taries Secretaries to the Senate.to the Senate, are all plebeians, and not any gen∣tleman admitted among them, and these are more respected then the other, and therefore wont to bee chosen out of those that are of the honester sort, and ciuiller kinde of people, they haue great stipends out of the common treasure, & are still acquainted with all the proceedinges and deliberations of the Senate, for they are alwayes present at the counsels of the colledge & senate, & therfore held of all men in high estimation, some of these are selected and chosen out to attend vpon the counsell of ten, whose decrees they register vp in bookes, and are priuie to all such things as are handled in the colledge, in which honor they remain as long as they liue, not by turns, as the gentlemen do in their of∣fices, of which there is not any perpetuall, but that of the Procurators: of these Secretaries to the Senate one The chiefe Se∣cretarie to the Senate is Chā¦celor of Veniceis aboue the rest, & is called Chancelor of Venice, a name of great dignitie and honour, for the Procurators one∣ly excepted, there is not any Gentleman but giueth him place, he is acquainted with euery secret of the common wealth, & hath great rents allowed him out of
the common treasure, and when he dyeth, his obsequi∣es are honored with a funerall oration, which dignity is not in Venice yeelded to any, vnlesse it be to the Duke or to some Cittizen of extraordinarie deserte, and to none else, the Chancelour representing as it were the prince of the common people, hee onely is chosen in the Sessions of the great Councell, the other Secretari∣es are created by the Colledge of tenne, and are subiect to their censure, if they make any faulte in the publike office, which they execute, likewise are the popular as∣semblies and companies of artificers and maisters of e∣uery occupation, and some others of whome wee will speake hereafter, depend vppon the arbitrement of the tenne, and are subiect to their authority, being by the same instituted at the first, and now still ordered and maintained, and surely the creation of this officer being at the first onely to auoide the daunger of these popular meetinges and assemblies, was not done with∣out exceeding prouidence and foresight, least other∣wise their fraternities and assemblies being at the first ordained for the common good, might in time vnder colour of assembling, to doe their dutie, haue tempted something preiudiciall to the common welths quietnesse. There are besides these fiue fellowshippes and so∣cieties Fiue other fellowships and societies vnder the names of plaine sancts.in Venice protected vnder the name and religion of certaine saintes, in which there are innumerable nū∣bers of men both plebeians and Patricians, of which e∣uery one hath his peculiar kinde of attire, ornament, & ensigne, which they neuerthelesse do not vse at all times but onely when they goe in procession, or to honour a∣ny mans funerall, or else to any solemne seruice, they
do vsually assemble euery holyday, first hearing diuine seruice, and then going about vnto the churches o the Saintes, honoring the high and immortall God, with pompous solemnitie of supplication and pray∣er. Euery of these fellowships hath his particular house, and in the same a goodly and spatious hall, in which v∣pon appointed dayes they do all meete to performe the duties which they do owe vnto religion, sometimes they haue Masse there solemnly celebrated, sometimes they go altogether to visite the church of some Saints oftentimes they solemnize the obsequy and funerall of one of their deceased brothers, offering oblations and dirges for his sinnes: besides those spatious halles eue∣ry of them hath an appointed seuerall roome, wherein both the heades and presidentes of these fellowships do meete, their office continueth but a yeare, and is among the Plebeians of especiall dignity and preroga∣tiue, their meetinges are to consult and take care for such thinges as are necessarie and fit for the good of the fellowshippe, and likewise there is committed to their trust a great quantitie of money, which i s to bee bestowed vpon the poore: for such and so exceeding in times past, was the estimation of these fellowshippes, that many who by testamēt had ordained and bequea∣thed the distribution of their goodes to the vse of the poore, would make these to bee their executors, and wholy referre the bestowing thereof to their discreti∣on, insomuch that some of these fellowships in great∣nesse of matters committed to their charge do scarsely giue place vnto the Procurators of that marke, which is one of the most honourable offices belonging to
the Patrician, of which none though he be a brother No Patrician may be head of these fiue fellowships.of the fellowship, may attaine to any of the precedent∣ships thereof, that dignitie belonging onely to the plebeians, wherein also they imitate the nobility, for these heades of societies doe among the people in a certaine manner represent the dignitie of the procura∣tors, but to the end that neither their societies, nor their heads, may any way be daungerous or cumbersome to the common wealth, they are all restrained vnder the power and authoritie of the Councell of ten, so that they may not in any thing make any alteration, nor assemble together, vnlesse it be at appointed seasons, without their leaue and permission, such honours doe the plebeians of eyther sort attaine vnto in this com∣monwealth of ours, to the end that they should not altogether thinke themselues depriued of publike au∣thority, and ciuile offices, but should also in some sort haue their ambition satisfied, without hauing occasion either to hate or perturbe the estate of nobilitie, by which equall temperature of gouernment, our com∣mon wealth hath attained that, which none of the for∣mer haue, though otherwise honorable and famous, for from the first beginning till this time of ours it hath remained safe and free this thousand and two hundred yeares, not only from the domination of Straungers, but also from all ciuile and intestine sedition of any mo∣ment or weight, which it hath not accomplished by a∣ny violent force, armed garrisōs, or fortified towers, but onely by a iust and temperate manner of ruling, inso∣much that the people do obey the nobilitie with a gen∣tle and willing obedience, full of loue and affection, & farre from the desire of any straunge change, of which
this time of ours hath made euident proofe, for when all the greatest princes of Christendome had combi∣ned themselues together with intention vtterly to o∣uerthrow, deface and abolish the greatnesse, glorie, & the very name of the Venetians, and that our armie had beene vanquished by Lewes king of France, neare to the Cittie of Cassano in the territorie of Cremona, with incredible slaughter: and the Almaines of one side, and Iulius Bishop of Rome, threatning and besieging vs with their armies, and all our dominions vpon the maine land, being reuolted from the Venetian gouern∣ment. In this our extremitie and generall perturba∣tion the people of Venice, were so farre from attempting any thing against the Nobilitie, that weeping, they threw themselues at their feete, offering their liues and goodes to the defence of the common wealth, and in effect reforming it, for hauing easily recouered Iadoua through the great loue and affection of the inhabitants towardes vs, when Maximilian the Emperour, raising euery where forces, came with a mighty Armie to be∣siege the same Cittie, many not onely of the Gentle∣men, but also of the plebeians, waging sundrie souldi∣ers at their owne charge, went vnto the defence there∣of, indeuoring themselues there, in such noble and va∣lorous sort, that the Emperour was constrained to with∣draw his Army, without deliuering so much as one as∣sault to the Cittie, neither with greater adoe were the rest of the Citties recouered, they all flocking againe to the Venetian Empire, as to a wished hauen of all securi∣tie and calmenesse: an excellent argument of a iust do∣mination to gouerne those that are desirous and wil∣ling so to be gouerned, which that it falleth not out so
without cause, as any man may perceiue that shall marke the course of our proceedinges, for we leaue to euery The equity & temperance of the Venetians gouernment.citty that commeth into the fellowship of our gouern∣ment, their own municipate lawes and statutes, and the Cittizens, euery one in their owne citties, obtaine many great and honorable places, and not a few towns of those abroad in the countrie, are gouerned by ma∣gistrates of their owne, chosen among themselues, as for those citties that are of greater fame, and in which our gouernours do rule, there do alwaies sit with them in Iustice, Doctors of the law, with whome our gouer∣nours are to consult before they determine any thing, which is both a matter of great honour and reputation, as also of great gaine and commoditie vnto them, these manner of offices may not bee executed by any of the Nobilitie of Venice, but are eyther chosen from among the plebeians, or else, and that in a manner alwaies from out the citties, subiected to our fellowship. And ther∣fore it may easilie appear, that this our commonwealth is tempered with that moderatiō, which seemeth chief∣ly and neerest to imitate nature. For in the body of a liuing creature the office of loo∣king about, and seeing is attributed onely to the eyes, and the other lesse noble offices, left vnto the other members that are depriued of the vse of seeing, obay∣ing and not dissenting from that which by the eyes they are enformed, but going and bending themselues thether, whether they are by them directed, and so the whole frame of the body is preserued and maintained in an excellent vnity and agreement, which not vnlike reason is the supreme rule of thinges in the common∣wealth of Venice committed to the Gentlemen, as to
the eyes of the citie, and the vnnobler offices to the peo∣ple, both together making a happie and wel compacted bodie: The eyes of the commonwealth, not onely see∣ing for themselues, but for all the other members, and the other partes of the citie, not so much regarding themselues, as willingly obeying the direction of the eyes, as being the principallest partes of the common∣wealth, whereas whatsoeuer commonwealth shall suf∣fer it selfe to be carried away into that folly and madnes, (as to many it hath happened) that the people will chal∣lenge vnto it selfe the office of seeing, & vsurpe the ex∣ercise of the eyes, necessarily the whole commonwealth must tumble into a downefall and ruine: And on the other side if the gentlemen shal onely prouide for their owne good, neglecting that of the other members, stir∣ring thereby the people to enuie & indignation, it were impossible that it should go wel eyther with the one or the other. Our ancestors therefore by the imitation of nature haue prouided both for the one and the other inconuenience, and haue therein vsed the iust tempe∣rature and excellent moderation, that none (vnlesse he be worse then a detractor) may any way blame or finde fault with a gouernment so vertuously established, and so temperately maintayned: which I beseech the Al∣mighty and euerliuing God long to preserue in happi∣nesse and safetie. For if it bee credible that any good thing commeth to men from God: then can there no∣thing bee more assured then that this great felicity is happened to the Citie of Venice through the onely blessing of his bountifull goodnesse. The end of the last booke of the Commonwealth, and Magistrates of Venice.
Sundry Notes and Collections which I haue gathered as well by reading and obseruation, as also by conference with Ve∣netian Gentlemen, skilfull in the state of their countrey, for the better vnderstanding of sundry points, eyther not at all touched in the former discourse, or else so obscurely, that the reader being a stranger cannot thereby rest fully satisfi∣ed, especially if he haue a curious desire to know euery parti∣cular of their gouernment. But this being added vnto the former, I doubt not but the state of the whole shal be so cleer∣ly and exactly deliuered vnto him, as though (if it were pos∣sible) he should see the same in a glasse. THe Citie of Venice is seated vpon certaine Islands within the lakes of The situation of the Citie of Venice descri∣bed by Dona∣to Gianotti a Florentine, more plain & particular in mine opinion then that of Contaren us.the Adriatique sea, directly ouer against that place where the riuer Brenta, that runneth along the ter∣ritory of Padoua, not long since en∣tred into those lakes: for the better knowledge of the nature and manner of which lakes, you must vnderstand that the Prouince of Marca Tre∣uizana, which the ancients called Venetia (whence this happie and famous Citie deriueth her beginning) ly∣eth so low along the shore of the Adriatique sea, that what through the waters of many riuers that fall from the maine lande, as also the ouerflowinges of the sea, which enter in through the gappes and breaches of that
huge and mightie banke, which they call Lito Maggior, a great space thereof within the said banke remayneth Lito Maggiorfennish and in water: which space resembleth a ben∣ded bow, the hollownesse of the land compassing and embracing the same being the bowe, and the string be∣ing this great banke I speake of, seruing as a bulwarke or rampire against the violence of the sea: reaching from the point of the saide sea, otherwise called Sinus Adriaticus, and so extending it selfe (in a manner) still The banke ex∣tendeth it selfe 60. miles.in a direct & straight line, till it come to ioyne with the shore of the mayne lande vnder Brondolo. This banke hath here and there certaine gappes, at which the sea at full tydes entreth in, and at low and ebbing water go∣eth out againe, and through them likewise doe those riuers that runne into the lakes passe into the sea. Those openings are also called Portes or Hauens, be∣cause they giue entry and passage to such ships, as come and go from all partes of the world. The principallest of them are those of Brondolo, of Chioggia, of Malomocco, of Castella, of S. Erasmo, Lito Maggior, and the Treports. All that space then, which is betweene the said banke & the firme land, is the same which we call the lakes of the Adriatique sea, which yet are not so wholly drowned in water, but that there are therein many vncouered & dry places, which are those Islands in which the borde∣ring people saued themselues from the tempestuous & barbarous furie of the Gothes and Vandales: and be∣ing there assembled together, did lay the foundation of this noble Citie: which where it is neerest, is fiue miles off from the maine lande, and two from the banke: it was in times past ten miles off from the maine land, the lakes then stretching to that place vppon the Brente,
which (as many thinke) was then for that cause called Ora Lacus.Ora Lacus, and is now called Oriago. But now notwith∣standing Oriago.all possible diligence vsed by the Venetians to the contrary, all the way is quite dryed vp between that Leccia Fusina,towne and Leccia Fusina, where the boates that come from Padoua to Venice, or go from Venice to Padoua, are lifted ouer the banke or ssuce that keepeth the fresh wa∣ter and the salt from meeting by certayne instrumentes like vnto our Cranes. The citie of Venice is diuided into two partes with a channell, which they call Il Canal grande, one parte of The great channel that parreth the citie of Venice in two.which looketh towardes the South and▪ the West, and the other towardes the East and the North. The chan∣nell slideth through in forme of the letter S. marked contrarily as here you see it S. it runneth ouer all with conuenient depth and breadth, as Arnus doth through Florence and Pisa, Tiber through Rome, and the Adice through Verona. They say that this channell was first made by the Brente, when it entred into the sea by the breach in the banke, called Porto di Castella, before such Many other channels enter into the great channellstime as the course thereof was stopped and diuerted at Leccia Fusina. Many other channelles also of conueni∣ent greatnesse with which Venice is adorned as other ci∣ties are with streetes) haue recourse into the same: for the most parte of these you must go by boate, vnlesse it bee some that haue a little pathe on one of the sides, and Streetes in Venice.some on both sides, but they are few. There are also in Venice many lande streetes, which they cal Calli, but they are nothing faire: for besides that they are neyther long nor straight, they are so very nar∣row, that two men can scarce go together in one of them side by side.
Bridges ouer the lesser channels. Ouer the chanels there are made many little bridges of stone, that do ioyne one streete to another, yet not so thicke, but that sometimes when you would go from one place to another, which is but hard at hande, you must fetch a great circuit about. Vpon the great channel there is but one only bridge, and the same of wood, standing in the most frequented part of the citie: for it ioyneth the Bialto, which is the place where the marchantes meet, with the streete that leadeth to the high Church, where the Dukes Pallace standeth. But because euery one that woulde passe the channell, shall not neede to come to this bridge so farre Diuers ordi∣narie passa∣ges or ferries ouer the great channel.about out of his way, there are in diuers places certaine ordinary ferry boats, vpon which pooremen do attend to set ouer such as shall require them: they are appoin∣ted what number of persons they shall ferry ouer at once, and withall what they shall take of euery passen∣ger. Likewise all the other lesser channelles are full of little boates, which they call Gondolas, to passe vp and downe along the Citie, which the Venetians doe vse in steed of horses, Mules and coaches. The gen∣tlemen haue many seruing to their owne vse, and many besides, wherewith their seruants gaine them money: so that the number of those boats is exceeding great. The beauty of the citie is much better perceyued by water then by land, for the channels be vniuersally large, & all the fayrest buildinges of the citie are seated vpon them, The fayrest shew of the citie answereth vpon the water.which though the answere also vpon the streetes (for e∣uery one hath two entries, one by water, another by land) yet the fayrest shew is commonly still to the wa∣ter. There are also sundry very faire houses, whose prin∣cipall front is to the streete, but the narrownesse of
the streetes hindereth and eclipseth the magnificence of their sight. Much garbage and filthinesse falleth from the citie into the channels, which is carryed away by the flow∣ing and ebbing of the water, and yet that alone would not serue the turne, but that they are also continually cleansed and taken away. Te ayre of Venice very healthy. In times passed (as Victruuius writeth) the ayre of Venice, by reason of the lakes was thought to be vnhol∣some, but now they hold that the ayre of Venice & Pa∣doua is purer and more healthy then in any other parte of Italie, in so much that there is not in any place to be found more lustly old men, well coloured & of good complexions. Donatus distinguisheth the inhabitants of Venice into Three sorts & degrees a∣mong the Venetians.three parts, viz. Plebeyans, citizens & Gentlemen. The Plebeians he tearmeth to be those that exercise base arts vtterly vncapable of office or degree in the common∣wealth: the citizens to be marchantes & men of a de∣gree aboue the other, capable of certaine popular offi∣ces: and the gentlemen to bee those of the great coun∣cell, Lords of the state, &c. as aboue. But this distinction is particular vnto himselfe, con∣trary to Sabellicus, Contarene, and the rest, who onely di∣uide them into two, Plebeians, and Patritians, viz. the common people, and the gentlemen. The first beginnings of the city were in the year 421. The begin∣nings of the citie.the first part that was builded thereof was the church of S. Iames, that is now to be seene in the Rialto. In the yere 1342. (Andrea Dandulo being Duke) there A great plague.died of the pestilence so great a multitude of people in Venice, that to repeople the same againe they were faine
to grant to all such as would come dwell within Venice, after two yeares habitation, freedome of their citie. Their number of fighting men. There are reckoned to be twenty thousand houses in the Citie, so that according to their computation al∣lowing out of euery family two, they are able to arme fortie thousand fighting men, and in former times haue done so. The gentlemen of the state abrode and at home are thought to be 3000. They are absolutely Lordes of the citie and whole estate both by sea and land. The children and brethren of the Duke liuing, and of the Dukes that are deceased, are alwayes helde in very great honour and much respected. The balles which they do vse in the great councel are eyther of Copper or Tin, of which some are guilted, & some siluered. Whosoeuer is chosen Elector for any office, may if he shall so thinke good, name himselfe in the same, and so stand to the comprobation of the suf∣frages, as in the former treatise is mentioned. When any waightie matter is to bee handled in the great councell, as the establishment of a new law, or the definitiue determination of any great iudgement, there must of necessitie be 600. gentlemen in the hall, & foure Councellors, or else the same may not passe. Signori delle Pompe. There are certaine magistrates, of whom the former treatise maketh no mention, called Signiori delle pompe, who are diligently to looke into the reformation of ap∣parell, and moderation of excesse generally in all other expenses, and finally to see all such lawes strictly obser∣ued as are in those behalfes prouided. Censors. There are likewise of late instituted and created with great authoritie two Censors, whose office is chiefly to
represse the ambition of the gentlemen, & to looke with seueritie into their faultinesse. There was a law lately propounded by them in the great councell, and by the same with great allowance ratified and enacted, that thence forward there should bee no congratulation v∣sed at breaking vp of the Councell, with those that had obtayned offices and honours: which still remayneth in vigor and force, for before time euery man at the o∣pening of the Councell, woulde presse to take them by the hand, that were elected for Magistrates, prote∣sting with many vowes, that they were glad in their harts, of the honour and aduauncement befallen them, yea euen those would say so that had giuen their suffia∣ges against them, which was by the Censors iud∣ged to bee a great abuse, and vnworthy of the Vene∣tian nobilitie, being in all other things so graue & ho∣norable. Vpon the death of the Duke, the six high counsellors do presently enter into the pallace: the eldest counsel∣lor supplying the place of the deceased Duke, and dis∣patching sundry things that do appertain vnto the roy∣all office. All letters that in the mean time the state sen∣deth forth, are entituled vnder the name of the gouer∣nors, & all such as are sent vnto them, are so directed & superscribed. They neuer stirre out of the Pallace till the creation of the new Duke. The great gates also of the Pallace are closed, and onely a wicket left open for people to go in and out, keeping there also a guarde of men, the same rather for a solemnitie and auncient custome, then any needfull occasion. For there is in the Cittie of Venice no greater alteration at the death of their Duke, then at the death of any
other priuate Gentleman, onely the magistrates doe not in the meane while assemble about the dispatch of affaires till the creation of the new Duke, hauing no leysure by reason of their busines thereabout to attende to any thing else. The Dukes funerall. The body of the dead Duke being adorned with roy∣all garments is brought into a lower hal, which they cal Sala de Pioueghi, where it is kept three dayes together, & there are twentie Gentlemen all attyred in skarlet, ap∣pointed to accompany the corps into the said hall, and to sit round about it, which likewise they do the follow∣ing dayes, at the end whereof his funerall is solemnised with all requisite pompe and magnificence. After the buriall of the Duke the great Councell is presently assembled, and in their first sitting there are chosen fiue Correctors, and three Inquisitors, the office of the Inquisitors is diligently to examine the life and Their office continueth but a yeare af∣ter the Dukes death.actions of the passed Duke, and whether he had obser∣ued their countrie lawes, if they finde him faultie, they are bound to accuse him; and the penalty by him deser∣ued, lighteth alwaies vpon his heires, who yet are no o∣therwise punished then onely by the purse, they amer∣ced the heyres of Loredanus one of their late Dukes, in 1500. Crownes, onelie because he had not vphelde his dignity, with such maiesty and magnificence, as he should haue done, and yet otherwise all they acknow∣ledge him to haue beene a very wise, and well deser∣uing prince. The office of the Correctors is to see whether it bee necessarie to make any new law, or to correct or amend anie abuse crept in vnder the gouernment of the o∣ther Prince.
When the Duke goeth abroad, all the belles of S. Marke are rung, and there go before him sounding many trnmpets of very extraordinarie greatnesse, and there are likewise borne before him certain streamers and banners, then a cushin, and a chayre of golde, and musicke next followeth the person of the Duke vnder a Cannopie in the midst of two of the chiefe Ambassa∣dors, the rest following him behinde, then follow next after them thirtie couples of Gentlemen, wearing all garments after the Ducall fashion, eyther of cloth, or skarlet, he that is on the right hand of the first couple, carrieth a sword vpright in his hand. The Duke hath yearely allowed him out of the cō∣mon A thousande and fifty pound of our money.treasure, 3500. crownes towardes his expence. Euery wednesday the Duke vseth to come downe from his Tribunal, and to go to the courts where the o∣ther Iudges and Magistrates do administer Iustice, and to looke into their proceedinges, exhorting and admo∣nishing them to do that which equitie and right re∣quireth, & if any suitor do thinke there that his case is not iustly delt withall, he may with al hūblenes recom∣mend the same vnto the Duke, which if the Duke find∣eth to be so indeede, hee presentlie commandeth the magistrate to do him reason: but if contrarie, he then reprehendeth him that made the complaint, and so proceedeth on forward: some of the late Dukes haue changed this order, and do not keepe any one certain day in this visitation of Courtes, to the end that they might chaunce in vpon the magistrates on a suddaine, and take them at vnwares. Whereas Contaren, in the former treatise writeth of a present of fiue wild Duckes, which the Duke was
yearely accustomed to send to euery Gentleman that The yearelie present of wildfoule al∣tered into mo∣ney.had not beene at his feast, now since the time in which he wrote, that kind of present is turned into a peece of siluer coyne, vpon one side of which is the picture of a marke reaching a standarde to the Duke, and on the o∣ther the names of the Duke, with the yeare of his raign with this circumscription. Donum A. G. Ducis Ve∣netorum. The counsell of tenne is a mightie member of the Venetian commonweealth, hauing in some sort a kinde of likenesse, in authority to the Romaine Dictator, that was created in times of danger: for in matters of great importance deepely touching the estate of the commō¦wealth, that require eyther secresie or speed of dispatch, eyther of the which shold be hindred, if they shold cō∣municate the same to the great coūcel, or to the Senate, they may of themselues determine and end it, as to de∣nounce a warre, to conclude a peace, to sende a pro∣ueditor into the armie, or to manage vnderhande a se∣cret practise, of eyther of which they haue many presi∣dents of happy successe to the state alwayes in these speedy deliberations, there assemble with them, the Duke and six Councellers, which assembly is simply & absolutely called the Councell of the tenne, the Coun∣cell of tenne haue certaine Gallies in the Arsenall par∣ticularly Capi de die∣ci: heads of the ten.belonging to their commandement & charge, signed with these two letters c. and x. for Capi de dieci. The power and authoritie of this Colledge of tenne is so great, & by reason thereof so subiect to enuy of the rest, that sundry times whē their terms were expired, there was much a doe to consent to the creation of these suc∣cessors, for remedy of which inconnenience, there was
such means wrought, that there was a law made, that the old Councell of ten shold keepe themselues still in authority, till such time as those new that should suc∣ceede in their places, were created & established, and fully confirmed. The office of Procurators, though it be not any of those, wherein the vertue and force of the common wealths gouernment consisteth, yet it is one of the grea∣test, most desired, and best respected dignities of Venice, continuing, during the life of those that are once elected euen like to that of the Duke, it is also one of the aunci∣entest offices, still from time to time maintaining it selfe in honour and reputation, euen vnto this present age, so that there was neuer in Venice any gentleman of any principall reckoning, but that did thinke himselfe greatly honored with this dignitie, and since the first institution thereof, few haue beene chosen Dukes, that had not first beene Procurators. Anciently there was only one procurator appointed to haue care of the Temple of Saint Marke, and of the holy Ornamentes, and Treasures thereunto be∣longing. But afterwardes vpon the death of the D. Sebastian Ciam, who left a great and mighty beqeuest to S. Marke, & withal, the ouersight and charge of al his rents & reue∣news to the procurator, the greatnes whereof exceeding the sufficiencie of any one magistrate throughly to take care of, and withall not to neglect his other charges belonging to the Temple; there was an other Procurator created to take charge alone of this Legacy, and bequest of Sebastian Ciam, whose honest fidelitie corresponding to the trust reposed in him, encouraged
many at their deathes, to leaue the administration of their goods vnto him insomuch that he growing vnable to beare the burthen of so many affaires, there was a third procurator chosen in the yeare 1270. Rimeri zen o Belling then Duke, and the busines so deuided betweene them, that one should looke to the Temple, and the Treasures thereof, another to those Legacies that were made on this side of the greate Channell, and the thirde to those that were made on the further side thereof: in this Dukes time was also the fourth cre∣ated and appointed to assist him that had the charge of the Temple of S. Marke, and the treasures thereof in equall authority, two more were made in the time of D. Giouani Soueranzo, and three more in the yeare 1423. Francisco Foscaro being Duke, so that they were in all nine, three for the Temple of S. Marke, and the church Treasures, three for the ouersight of Legacies, made on this side of the great channell, and three for those on the further side, the yeare 1509. when their Armie was ouerthrowne at Adda, by Lewes the 12. king of Fraunce, the commonwealth being in distresse, they were contented for a summe of money to impart this dignitie to six more, and since haue beene so many made, that they come in all to be foure and twenty, all the rest that are added to the first nine, haue seuerall procuration appointed them, as you may reade in the former Treatise, they haue likewise authority to constraine the heyres to perform the Will of the testa∣tors: they weare such fashioned garmentes as the Duke doth, and are followed with many seruants, in procession the six Councellers do goe before them & the three heades of the Forty, for as they goe along the
Councellers and the saide heades are vpon the right hand, and the Procurators vpon the left, they haue eue∣ry one a dwelling place, or else forty Ducates a yeare al∣lowed them. They all are admitted into the Senate, but not into the Councell of tenne, saue onely nine of the eldest and best respected, they cannot obtaine any other of∣fice, vnlesse it be of the chiefe sages, or else the Giunta to the councell of tenne, and when there is a captain generall of the army, or a proueditor of the campe to be chosen, there is a law made in the Senate, that who∣soeuer is a procurator, may obtain that dignitie, which is so ordained, to the end that such great and weightie charges should be executed by men of great estimation and honour, they may not come into the great counsel, but onely by the election of the Duke, which is late∣ly graunted by a speciall decree, they were wont to stand in the Court without the great Councell, when the same was assembled, and there to stay during the continuance of the Councell, within the pallace, to the end that if any disorder should happen, they might be at hand to amend it, and this in likelihoode was the occasion, that they were first forbidden to enter into the Councell: but not this custome of assembling themselues, and staying in the courte, while the coun∣cel sitteth, is no longer obserued, which proceedeth through the quiet and generall securenesse of the cit∣tie: insomuch that they thinke it altogether needlesse for the Procurators to be morein one place then in a∣nother. These three councels of the Forty are exceeding∣ly well discoursed of in the former treatise, neuerthe∣lesse
for the full and cleare vnderstanding of their seue∣rall offices and dignities, I thought good to set here downe some particularities by him omitted, the reci∣tall of which, though perchance in his opinion he dee∣med needelesse, yet I iudge them not vnnecessarie to those that doe desire to haue a perfect knowledge of the Venetian gouernment. The first of these three councels of forty are as you haue heard, the new, for ciuile matters abroad, the second for ciuile matters within, and the third is called the crim inall councell, which is not onely aboue all causes criminall both at home and abroade, that are brought vnto it by vertue of appeale, but also doth of it self determine many entire causes, that are not touch∣ed of any other magistrare, the forty are chosen in the great councell, and must all passe the age of 30. yeares, the other offices any gentleman may attaine at the age of 25. years: the election is not made all in one day, but in eight seuerall dayes, & sitting in euery of which they chuse fiue vpon the choice of these new forty, they are straight admitted into the new ciuile councell, and doe enter thence into the old ciuile councell, and they of the old ciuile presentlie into the criminal, as you heard before, so that passing 8. moneths, in either their whole time of authority is 2. yeares, there are ouer euery of these, 43. heades, and two vnder heades, which authori∣ty they hold onely two moneth s a peece, the heads of the last forty which are the criminall Iudges, are they that do ioyn with the Duke & councellors, & with thē do represent the person of the Venetian gouernment. These heads & vnderheads are all elected by lot.
There are also in the great Councell, three manner of Magistrates created, that do bring in and propound causes, euery one to the forty appointed him, the first are the three Aduocators of the common which doe bring in the causes to the Criminall forty. The second are the three old Auditors that doe bring in the home ciuile causes, to the old ciuile Forty. The thirde are the three new Auditors that do bring all forrein ciuile causes, into the new ciuile Forty. The Aduocators of the common, is a dignity of great account, and neuer graunted but to men of greate yeares, wisedome, and experience, his chiefest charge is to see the lawe strictly obserued, and therefore in iudgement he is alwaies against the offender. There are also many that are Aduocators, whose office is to pleade in causes, eyther of accusing or defendiug, accordingly, as they are eyther by the plaintife or defendant, entertained: it is not of necessity requisit that they be Doctors of law, or that they haue therein much studyed, onely that they be skilfull in the statutes, & ordenances of the commonwealth, they must all be gentlemen, for there is an ancient law, that none may plead before the magistrate, vnlesse he bee a gen∣tleman: and therefore there are in the great Councell chosen 24. Aduocators, 20. for the offices of the palays, and 4. for the Ryalto: of which euery one that goeth to law, is bound to entertayn one, and to pay him a certain fee, and he likewise is bound to defend his cause, who entertaineth him, the place where they plead, is some∣what high, & they haue at their feet the notary of the 40 with such writings as they mean to produce, & diuerse
times amid their pleading they command him to reade now one Chapter, now one writing, and then another, as the cause requireth. The time that eyther partie is allowed for speech is an hower and a halfe, besides the time that is spent in reading the writinges: in so much that when the Aduocate speaketh, there is an houre glasse helde vpright, and when the writinges are read, the same is turned vpon one side, to the ende the sand shoulde not fall through, and then is turned vpright a∣gaine when he beginneth to speake. When eyther part hath alleadged his reasons, & that sentence is to be giuē the youngest of the fortie causeth euery of the Iudges to sweare that he will giue that sentence, which in his conscience he shall thinke to be iust, & then they go to their suffrages, in manner as you may see in the former treatise. All causes that are brought vnto the Aduocators are registred vp by their secretarie, one first, the other next, & so forth, in order as they come, and looke in what or∣der they are registred, in the same are they by them brought in, and propounded to the fortie, except it be some, which though they come last, yet they are still first dispatched, as the case of prisoners, of burialles, of medicines, of corne, of rewardes, of Orphlins, of neere kindred, as if the brother should pleade with his bro∣ther, or the father with his sonne: these causes are alway first heard, and likewise all such as any way per∣taine to the office or administration of the Procurators. The dominion of the Venetians is diuided into two partes, the one by sea, the other by land, out of eyther of which they receyue a great yearely in-come. Of the two they account the firme lande reuenewe to bee the
greater, especially their possessions in Lombardie are maruellous rich and auayleable vnto them: where be∣sides many other townes, castels, and villages, they pos∣sesse seuen faire cities, as Treuigi, Padoua, Vicenza, Vero∣na, Brescia, Bergamo, and Crema. By sea they are Lords of Cypres, Candia, Corfu, and many other Islandes. Vp∣pon the coastes also of Sclauonia, Dalmatia and Histria, they possesse many goodly Cities and castelles. Be∣sides these the rents of their owne citie, their customes and tolles by sea, and their ordinarie yearely taxation or rather (as they call it) tribute of the inhabitantes, a∣mounteth to an excessiue summe: in so much that their reuenews one way or other is knowne to beat the least 1200000. Duckets by the yeare: their charges & yeare∣ly occasions of disburstment are likewise very great, for alwaies they do entertain in honorable sort, with great prouision a Captaine generall, who alwaies is a stran∣ger borne: he that now enioyeth that place is one Iohn Baptista de Monte a Florentine borne, a notable soldier, and a very honourable Gentleman, one vnder whome I haue serued in the warres, and am in all thankefulnesse to acknowledge many fauors that I receiued both from him and his brother Camillo de Monte. Besides they do continually entertayne in pay a thousand men at armes, and a great number of footemen, sufficient to keepe and defend those places, in the which they keep garisons alway, as well in times of warre, as of peace: they giue likewise great pensions to many gentlemen and Captaines, whose seruice they vse when neede re∣quireth. The most part of their land forces they main∣taine in Lombardie, where by reason of the aboundance of victuailes they may liue commodiously, and when
time of warre so requireth, they send them thence whi∣ther they shall thinke good. They also keepe continu∣ally tenne or twelue armed Gallies of warre, which are distributed in Cypres, Candia, and Corfu, and other com∣modious places. In euery Galley they haue 150. row∣ers: for there are 50. benches, and vpon euerie bench three rowers, besides euery one contayneth betweene 80. and 100. soldiers to fight. The charges of euery Galley one way or other amount to 700. duckettes a month, likewise their prouisions of warre and the char∣ges of and concerning their Arsenall are of an infinite and excessiue expence. They haue alwaies armour in the Arsenall to arme ten thousand men, and in the armory of the Dukes pal∣lace to arme 1500. against whatsoeuer sodaine inconue∣nience might happen, besides an innumerable quantity of munition pertaining to the sea, and artillery of all sort in maruellous proportion. In times of warre and neces∣sitie they do sometimes propose great offices and dig∣nities to sale for a certaine summe of money: for which when sundry offer the summe proposed, yet none is e∣lected vnlesse he ouercome his competitors and riuals by suffrage, so that commonly not withstanding the sale thereof, yet the same neuer falleth vpon any but vpon the wisest and most sufficient men.
Collections taken out of the historie of Signior Bernardo Giustiniano, a Gentle∣man of Venice. TOuching the original of the name of the Venetians, there are sundry opinions. Some write that they come of a certaine people of Asia, called Eneti, who after the destru∣ction of Troy, hauing lost Phileme∣ne their king, came with their na∣uie vnder the conduct of Antenor, into those lakes of the Adriatique sea, giuing the name of Veneti vnto that part of Italy where they setled, which opinion is by Liuie maintayned. Plinie, Cato, and Cornelius Nepos, deriue the Venetians absolutely from the of spring of the Tro∣ianes. Seruius Grammaticus will needes haue their nomina∣tion to come from Enetus king of the Sclauonians. But once, howsoeuer they differ in their true originall: they all agree that they are of great antiquitie, & famous e∣uen in their first beginnings. The Cantons of Venice did before the inhabitation of the lakes, vnder that name embrace a great circuite vppon the mayne lande, as all Marca Treuigiana, and the greater part of Foro Iulio: but now onely the Iles, & inhabited places within the lakes
do retaine and peculiarly challenge to themselues the name of Venice. The situation thereof is so strange and singular in it selfe, that it brooketh no comparison or resemblance with any other Citie, eyther of this present or former ages: the manner wherof is this. There is a long banke that encompasseth the vtmost Gulfe of the Adriatique sea: within the inner parte whereof are certaine great marishes or fennes, occasioned partly by the descent of the riuers from the maineland, partly by the flowing of the sea: within these were sundry little townes, built by those that endeuoured to defende themselues from the furie of the land warres, and lastly Venice. Nature the mistresse and best working perfectresse of thinges, defendeth them from the violence of the sea, by the opposition of this banke, increased with huge heapes of sand: and yet not altogether without the artifice and trauaile of man, by fortifying against the sea in places needful, with strong palisadoes and migh∣tie peeres or bulwarkes of stone. These lakes were in times passed vpon their brinkes to the maine land en∣compassed and adorned with many great and renow∣ned cities, as Aquileia on the east side thereof, sometimes a famous Colonie of the Romanes: next vnto it Con∣cordia, then Vderzo, then Altinos, likewise Triuigi and Padoua, then the Moncellese, which some will needes haue to be that which was called Acello, then vpon the bounding and shutting vp of the vtmost point Adria & Rauenna, which was in those daies also inuironed about with marishes and fennes, and cleansed by certaine ditches, that (as Strabo writeth) were made for the same purpose: but whereas in the beginninges of Augustus
Caesar the buildings thereof were all of woode. Afterwards Augustus and his successors Tiberius, Tra∣iane, Valentian, and Theodoricke, enobled it with goodly edifices, of marble and free stone, each of them doing somewhat, as well in erection of many sumptuous pri∣uate pallaces, as publique magnificent Temples, for the Gods. And withall they filled and choaked vp those marishes, in sorte that they reduced them to firme ground, so that whereas before it was of all sides enui∣roned about with those waters, it is now distant three miles from them. Besides sundry of lesse reckoning, there do disgorge downe into these Lakes, seuen famous riuers that come descending from the Alpes: as Taliagmento, Liuenza, La Piaue, La Brenta, Bachiglione, Adice and Poe: which two last riuers, the Adice and the Poe haue filled and stuf∣fed vp those parts of the Lakes, into which they fall with sande, and the like haue sundry of the other riuers done in many places: but where the industrie and trauaile of men hath defended and preuented the inconueni∣ence thereof. For those marishes and Lakes, whose length in times passed little lesse extended then two hundred miles, are now reduced to the halfe thereof. Their breadth where they are now at largest, not be∣ing aboue twelue mile, whereas in the time of our an∣cestors it was twice as much, which being a thing that the enemies of the Venetian State could neuer accom∣plish, though with great endeuour many times they attempted to choke and drie vp those Lakes, time hath by little and little, by the descent of those land riuers ef∣fected it without any forraine violence, in dispight of all the defences opposed by the Venetians. The great
encompassing banke hath in manner as many ruptures and passages as are the great riuers that descend into the lakes: at which the tides of the sea go in & out, ebbing and flowing euery sixe houres by turne. The floud neuer ariseth higher then foure feet with∣in the Gulfe, vnlesse sometime when the winde Seirocco bloweth with an extraordinary violence, & then some∣times it ariseth to the height of seuen feet. Sebastian Munsters description of the Citie of Venice. VEnice was first the name of a Pro∣uince, and not of a Citie. There be many other Townes in Italy of greater antiquitie. About the yeare of our Lorde 300. there came out of Scithia a barbarous people, called Hunnes, ouerrunning sundry nations of Europe, with excee∣ding terror and crueltie, their first vagabonding race was into Thracia, and thence they passed through Mesia & Illiria into Italie. The Venetians that then inhabited a Prouince vppon the firme lande, on the Adriatique shore, hearing of their arriual, fled into the sea, seating themselues there in little Ilandes, of which there were
many at hand, liuing for the most part there by fishing. The Rialto why to called.At length they began to build vpon these Islands, chief∣ly vpon that which is called Riuo alto, to called, because the water is more deepe then there about the other Is∣landes, or els because that Island is more eminent then the rest: in short space the deuastation and crueltie wrought by Attyla vpon the neighbouring land towns, as Aquileia, Concordia, Alcina, Padoua, Optergia, Hera∣clia, Aquilius, Grado, Capreola, and Lauretta, did (as it were) by a reuolution giue a speedie beginning to the rising greatnesse of Venice. The first founders thereof were those of Padoua: in short time it increased in opu∣lence and riches, and grew mighty both by sea and lande, conquering many Realmes, Cities and Ilands, of which the Turke in our time hath taken some from them. He meaneth that she is cōmandresse of the Adtia∣tique seas. In fine this noble, goodly and magnificent citie is become Queene of the sea, and inhabited by people of sundry nations, and traffiqued to by marchants from out all partes of the world. There a man may heare all languages, and see all diuersitie of garments: it is said that the onely Tribute which the state rayseth of wine, Sixe hundred thousand pound ster∣ling.salt and other thinges, amounteth to two millions of Duckets, besides the other tributes and rentes which they rayse of such Citties as are vnder their subiec∣tion. The first created a Duke in the yeare of our Lord 700. before time their commonwealth was gouerned by Tribunes: but afterwardes by reason of discord be∣tween themselues, & many attempts enterprised against thē by the Lombaras by commō & general confent they elected a Duke, to maintaine them in concorde, and to
defende their liberty, but in succession of time mis∣liking their gouernment, they put many of their Dukes to a shamefull death, they slew Vrsus their third Duke in a sedition, and put out both the eyes of Theodore his Munster cal∣leth this Theodore Diendome.sonne, after he had likewise ruled them awhile: they hanged Obleno their 10. Duke vpon a gibbet, and after∣wardes tare him to pieces, they murthered the thir∣teenth in the church, and burned the fourteenth in his pallace, the yeare 958. they put the fifteenth into a cloi∣ster, they banished the 28. and stoned to death the 45. called Rinaldo, they imprisoned the 46. and beheaded the 55. These and other thinges are written of the Veneti∣ans and their Dukes, but Gasper Contareno that hath written expresly of the commonwealth of Venice, be∣ing himselfe a Senator of the City, toucheth not at all the miserable end of these Dukes, his attire is no whit different from that which kings doe vse, for his garmentes are all of purple or rich cloth of golde: hee weareth on his heade a royal diademe made of linnen, which is inuironed with a hoode of purple, aboute which there goeth a little crowne of golde, when hee entreth into the Senate, he hath his throne gorgeously adorned, and the Senators speake vnto him with their heades bare standing vp as before a Prince, all letters sent and receiued are directed and signed to and by the Duke. The lawes are published in his name, and their coyne stamped with his name and image, in fine the Duke in all things representes the person of a king be∣fore his subiectes, saue that he hath not the bridle of ful authoritie in his owne handes, to make him appeare with the greater magnificence and pompe, they allow
him out of the common treasure 1500. Crownes, which he may not turn to his particular vse, but on such things as pertaine to the greatnes and traine of a prince, other∣wise his heires should be sure to pay the amends of so great dishonour after his death, hee must of his owne charge maintaine a great troupe of seruantes to follow him, when hee goeth abroade, and to make euery yeare foure Bankets to the Senators and Gentlemen. Vpon Ascention day, according to the custome of his Predicessors, hee goeth aborde a fine ship curious∣ly trimmed, and set sorth, and in company of the Bi∣shop, The ship is called the Bientorie.and other Senators, launcheth out into the Sea, throwing a ring into the same, with expresse words, that hee marrieth the Sea in perpetuall Dominion, and rule. The Bishop also vseth certain ceremonies, which being ended they departe, the election of the Duke is in such sort by lot, that no mans ambition, bry∣bery, or subornation may stand him any way in steade, presently vpon his choice, hee is borne by the marri∣ners with great pomp to the place of S. Marke, throw∣ing al the while, money about in the streetes, till such time as he come to the place where the Diademe is put on his heade. Touching their rents, riches, common treasure, reuenewes, tributes, exactions and customes, that they leuie out of the Cities, that are vnder them, it is not ea∣sie to giue a iust reckoning, but it is written, that they do sometimes charge their subiectes with very heauie tributes: Charlemaine graunted great priueledge to the Venetians, for which notwithstanding they were vn∣thankefull, and secretly sent aide to Nicephorus Empe∣rour of Constantinople, that was his enemie, whereat
Charlemain being agrieued, sent his sonne Pepin, whome he had made king of Italie to be reuenged, so that Pe∣pin leuying a great Armie, chased them to the Rialto, where hee intended to assault them, and to that ende made a great long bridge, but by reason of tempestuous weather, his bridge brake, and his enterprise failed. In the yeare of our Lord, 810. certaine marchantes brought the body of S. Marke from Alexandria to Ve∣nice, The body of S. Mark when brought vnto Venice.in whose honour they did build that most goodly & glorious church which is now there to be seene. In the yeare. 1202. they gat the Iland of Crete now The times of their con∣questes.called Candia, which did before pertaine to the Empe∣rour of Constanstinople, also vnder Otto the 3. Empe∣rour of that name they adioyned to their dominion many other Ilands and cities, principally Parence, Pole, Arbu, Coricte, Corcyre, now called Corphu, Pharo also nowe called Lesima, and many other citties where Py∣rats had their receipt. Some few years after; the Turke began to make wars vpon them, and taking from them the fayre cities of Tirachum in Albany, and Croy in Slcauonia, did so abase them, and bring them to such a diffidence of their strength, that to obtaine his frend∣ship they were faine to giue him 13. fayre cities, which they had conquered, and wonne from the Emperour of Greece, besides Cosdre a most goodly cittie of Alba∣ny, in the yeare 1400. they got Vincensa that appertai∣tained to the Vicount of Mylan, in the year 1472. they got Padoua, and Verona, from the Romaine Empire, in the yeare 1402. they possessed themselues of the realme of Cipres, some say by a detestable and vnchri∣stian practise, which was in order, as followeth.

daughter of a Gentleman of Venice, called Marcus Cor∣narius, which daughter was after the death of Iaques, ad∣opted by the Senate, and by this meanes they posses∣sed themselues of the Realme, for she being great with child at the death of her husband, the Venetians as tu∣tors retired her vnto them, and tooke adminstration of the Realme, some will say that they poisoned the child afterwards, as likewise they had done the father before, others write otherwise, that they did not get the realm by so great wickednesse, but that after the death of the father and the sonne, they succeeded in the Realm, by way of adoption and inheritance.

This City of Venice hath threescore and two pa∣rishes, and one and forty Monasteries: it hath as ma∣nie Channels as streetes: there are foure hundred publike Bridges, besides particulars, there are of boats for all vses, eight thousande, in the Arsenall, which is rounde about inuironed with walles, there are con∣tinually foure hundred men which are dayly imploy∣ed in mending and making of Galleis, and other things pertaining to the Sea, in the Isle of Meurano, fast by,
they make very cleare and goodly glasses, commonly Christall glasses.called Christal glasses, which are thence transported into all countries. Notes out of Girolamo Bardi. THe first that euer inhabited vpon that Iland called the Rialto, where Venice now standeth, was one Gio∣uani Bono a poore man, that hauing there a simple cottage did liue with his family by taking of fish: after∣wardes Radagasso with an armie of Gothes, entring into Italy, sundrie from of the firme land fled into this poore mans house for safety of their liues, and among the rest one Entinopus a carpenter of Candia, who found meanes to build himselfe there a house, maintaining himselfe afterwards by the making of small barkes and boates: After Radagasso Alaricus comming like a tempest into Italy, there fled so many ouer thether, as that at length there were built foure & twentie seuerall houses of bordes and reedes: but in the yeare of our Lord, 418. the fury of the warres being somewhat mitigated, the most part of these fugitiues had gotten themselues into Padoua, whereof a suddain hearing great and fearefull rumors of newe intended entries into Italy by Aiulfo king of the Vissigots, with a mighty multitude of Barbarians, by a generall consent they agreede to make some firme place within these lakes, and thereupon to build a citty, which they pre∣sently effected vpon the foresaide Iland, gathering into
the same the people that were dispersed about the o∣ther Ilandes, and withall making it of the best defence they could, they called it by the name of Venice, the beginning of this Citties foundation was laide in the yeare 421. vpon the 25. day of March about noon, there were three Consuls chosen by those of Padoua to haue the ouersight and charge, the rest whose names were Alberto Faletro, Tomaso Candiano, and Zeno Daulo: this is a breuiat drawn out of the ancient Records of Padoua. Afterwardes the ruine and desolation of manie fayre citties vpon the maine land, gaue a speedy migh∣tinesse and encrease to this new erected citie, insomuch that many of the noblest land inhabitantes, fled thether with their treasures and richest moueables, transporting euen their goodly pillers, carued stones, and other mat∣ter to build withal, to Venice, erecting thereunto them∣selues new and stately mansions, so that in the end de∣lighted with the security of the place, hauing their chil∣dren borne & brought vp there, they resolued there perpetually to remaine: there are in Venice 72. (as they cal them) Parochiae, that are equall in manner vnto Bi∣shoprickes, ouer which are elected graue and reuerent pastors chosen out of that quarter and particion of the city, wherein their churches stand: these churches haue great & goodly rents belonging vnto them, & are excee∣dingly adorned with Organs, images, instruments and all other magnificent ornamentes. The Arsenall is in compasse without the wals 3. miles about, & resembleth in it self a little world hauing with∣in it such varietie ofseuerall handicrafts and trades that it is in manner vnpossible for any to comprehend them in his minde that hath not seene them with his eyes,
insomuch that the marquesse of Guasto who was gene∣rall The Marques of Guasto his speech touch∣ing the Arsenalvnder the Emperour Charles the 5. in Italy, hauing gon vp and downe in it from morning to night, at his comming forth sware that he had rather be Lord of the Arsenall then of 4▪ of the best citties of Italy, all manner of armes, weapons, artillerie, sayles, powder, anchors, tacklinges, and whatsoeuer else to be imagined pertai∣ning to the war, and the Galleis themselues are not onely kept and preserued within the Arsenall, but also wrought and framed, there do dayly worke within it 1580. men, who haue all wages according to their de∣crees, who when they are so old that they can worke no longer, are there also entertained so long as they liue. The prince being dead, his bowels are taken out, and his body embawmed, after which hee is kept three dayes openly, in the hall, attended on with Senators, as you heard before, his herse being couered ouer with cloth of gold, and his sword and his spurres of gold ly∣ing athwart vpon him, then in carrying him to his bu∣ryall, the fraternities of the towne are assembled, & the seuerall companies of the chanons and clergie with an innumerable number of torches, many of which are carried by the Iesuites, in middle of which followeth the beere, whereon the body of the prince reposeth in such sort as you hearde, next after followeth the offi∣cers and chiefe seruantes of the princes family, all ap∣parrelled in blacke with great hoodes ouer their heads, and drawing a long traine after them, representing a maruelous shew of mourning and sorrow, then next after follow the Senators, all in skarlet and graine, sig∣nifying the citty to be free, & therefore ought not to mourn at the death of any prince how vertuous soeuer
With this pomp they passe on to the place of S. Marke, where ioyning with the beere to the great dore of the church, they lift it vp nine times, as in taking perpetuall leaue thereof, and thence go vnto the church of S. Gio∣uani, Paulo, (where for the most part the Dukes lie buri∣ed, and there reposing the bodie vpon a high place of e∣state, brightned with a number of flaming torches round about, the Signeurie sitteth downe, and there in the pulpit is made a solemne funeral oration, in com∣mendation and honour of the dead prince. The fune∣nerall being ended, the Senators returne to the pallace, and presently proceed to the choice of a new Duke. There are certaine officers, of which Contareno spea∣keth nothing at all, or els very sparingly, and some that haue been instituted since his time, of all which I think it not necessarie briefly to say somewhat, for the better satisfaction of the reader: and first of those whom they call Cathaueri. These are Iudges of the confiscations, and exactors of the publique duties, they were created in the yeare 1280. They succeed in the goods of those that die in∣testate, if they haue no lawfull heires. They gather in those penalties as are by the other Iudges inflicted vp∣on offendors. They are Iudges ouer the officers of shipping. They make publike sales in name of the commune: they are Iudges of such thinges as are founde at sea, or treasures that are found at land. They heare such differences as do arise between pilgrims that go to the holy land, and the matters of the ships wherein they go, & the names of the pilgrims are registred in their office, and they are newly put in authoritie about the determination of
such causes as concerne the inhabitants of Cipres. Sopra Ca∣staldi. There are other called Sopracastaldi, whose office is to serue executions vpon iudgement, so that they are called Iudges of executions. They haue the selling of such goods as are attached by executions, & haue the hearing of all such differences as do arise about such at∣tachments, executions, contradictions, &c. They are euery morning at S. Markes: they haue also place in the Rialto. They were instituted in the yeare 1471. Because there might errour be committed in the ex∣ecution of iudgements, it was ordayned that the prince should heare the appeales from the executions of the former officer: but because his person was to be busied about greater affaires, there were certaine Superiors ordayned that might censure the doings of the Sopra∣castaldi. And because they might also sometimes erre in their deliberations, it was likewise ordayned, that from them also might the partie agreeued appeale to the Ad∣uocators. They were created in the yeare 1485. Signeore all aque. There are certaine officers ouer the water, called Sig∣nore all aque. They haue charge of such things as apper∣tayne to the Lakes, & to the cleansing of the channels: Sig▪ alla Sanita Mountbanks are certaine that shew their drugs in the market places, vaunting of great cures they haue done, & with long tales per∣suading the people to buy their ware.and those boats that are vpon the great channell are vn∣der their authoritie. Besides those other things menci∣oned in the former treatise that belongeth to the office of the healthmaisters: they haue authority to giue li∣cence to phisicions to practise, and to Mountebanks, & Chiarlatanes to go vp and downe the countrey, and to preach in the markets: to them also is brought the regi∣ster, containing the number of all publike women with∣in the towne: Finally, so great is their authoritie, that in time of sicknes they haue power to punish with death.
Doana de Mare, are officers of the custome, who are to looke to such marchandise as is brought in by the com∣mon gallies and ships, and not to suffer any thinges to passe, till all duties and custome be discharged. Signori della Pace. There are also fiue peacemaysters, who are to iudge between them that giue one another blows or wounds, or do offer any other kind of wrong, or do vse any villa∣nie in speech, their office is to appease strife, and to make attonement and friendship, as much as in them lieth. Iustitia vecchia, are certaine magistrates that haue po∣wer & authority to do right vnto those that do pretend hyre, wages or reward: they punish those that do falsi∣fie waightes, measures or such like. They put a price vpon such hearbes and fruits as are to be sold: likewise in their office are written vp the names of all such boyes as doe for wages tie themselues to the seruice of may∣sters. They were wont to deale in the matter of wools, butnow since the increase of that marchandise, there is appointed a particular officer ouer the same. Al manner of trades are vnder this office. They that keepe shoppes haue the allowance of the signes from hence: They may be appealed from to the Cathaueri, and to the old Auditors, according to the causes. Consoli di Marcantanti: to this office is all manner of marchandise subiected, wherein there is eyther buying or selling. They proceed briefly & by way of extension. Sopraconsoli are those that haue to doe with Mar∣chantes that breake bankerout, and with matters of pawnes. They grant protection to such as are indebted, whereby their bodies may be kept free frō prison: they proclaime with a very solemne ceremony those that are fugitiue for debt, limiting thē a certain time of returne,
which if they doe not, they then sell all such goodes of theirs as they can lay their hands on, and therewith pay the creditors as farre as it will stretch. The fugitiues vppon their returne are bound fully and wholly to pre∣sent all their goodes into this office, of which they then receyue a protection for a month, in which time they haue libertie to agree with the creditors if they can, if not, then the Sopraconsulles are to make their agree∣ment for them: alwaies prouided that afore the satis∣faction of any creditors, the dower of the parties wife, the rent of his house, and the money belonging to the Signeorie, if he haue any thereof in his handes, are still first deducted. Iustitia Noua is an office to which belongeth the o∣uersight of Innes and Tauernes, to reforme their abuses & to see that their wines be not mingled or corrupted: this office was instituted in the yeare 1261. There are also certaine officers ouer the Salt, called Signori al Sale. Ragione Vecchie are certaine that are appointed to en∣tertaine such strangers and embassadors as the state will haue honoured, and to defray such charges as thereby shall arise to the state out of the common treasure. Ternaria Vecchia is an office that exacteth the cu∣stome of Oyles, and haue superintendence of all things thereto appertayning. Signori alla Grassa are such as do ouersee the abuses in Cheese, salt meates, Suet, and such like, and haue po∣wer to punish those that commit any falshood or abuse thereabout. Signori dipanni a ora haue the charge and ouersight of Goldweauers, and such as do make cloth of Golde,
Tissue and such like: to the end there be no falshood v∣sed, which if they find, they haue authoritie to take the cloathes away, and to cut them in peeces. Proueditori di Commune are certaine magistrates in∣stituted of purpose for the common good. They are to see that such shippes as be made be well wrought, & great and capable, fit to the proportion, and that at their setting forth they be not ouerburthened. They are to repaire the streets, to paue them, & to keep the bridges of the Citie in good order: all the lesser schooles and fraternities are vnder them, as the greater are vnder the Counsell of tenne: They looke into the abuses of all handy crafts, and punish such as vse deceipt. They haue charge ouer the ordinary ferries. They looke into the priuiledges of the communalty, and taxe the prices of bookes. The Citie of Venice is diuided into sixe parts, which they call Sestieri: three of one side the great channell, and three on the other: their names are thus. Castello, S. Polo, S. Marco, S.

In a generall reuiew of the people made some fewe yeares since in Venice▪ there were reckoned this number of all sorts, as followeth. Fifty nine thousande three hundred forty and nine men: sixty seuen thousande fiue hundred thirty and one women: youthes betweene the age of six and of twenty years, to the number of fifty eight thousande foure hundred and twelue: two thousand one hundred fourescore and three Fryers: two thousande fourescore and two Nunnes: one thousand one hundred fifty and seuen Iewes. The whole summe of all amounteth to the num∣ber of 190714: A briefe description of some particularities in the City worthy to be knowne. The length of the great channell, is a thousande and three hundred paces: and in bredth ouer forty paces▪ it is wonderfully beautified on eyther side with most sūp∣tuous and goodly pallaces, you cannot go ouer it a foot, but at one bridge onely, which is at the Ryalto. There are thirteen seuerall ferries or passages, which they call Traghetti. The bridges that ioyne the little Isles together are in number 400: some of wood and some of stone. There belong to the chanels 8000. Gondalas and a∣boue. The steeple of S: Marke is 280. feet in height, and euery square containeth forty feete, in bredth it is distant from the Church 80. feet, and hath the same to be wrought with such curiositie of workemanship, that the like is scarsely to be found in any other pane of the world.
Francesco Sansouini. AMong sundrie others that haue writ∣tē of Venice; Francesco Sansouini is one of the latest, who very particularly, but in my opinion somewhat super∣fluously hath touched not onely the customes of the Citie, and the liues of the princes, but also the antiquities, ceremonies, foundations, monumentes, and epitaphes of euery seuerall church, out of whose great volume I haue onely extracted those fewe notes, seruing to my purpose, the rest I haue omitted as tedious, and not greatly needfull to be knowne. Venice encompasseth in circuite eight miles, being diuided into 70 rapes or diuisions, which 70▪ churches commonly called parishes, euery one of the which is the head of that rape or diuision wherein it standeth. It contayneth likewise 59▪ monasteries, 31. of Eryers, and 28. of Nunnes, besides a great number of goodlie schooles, and most ample and statelie Hospitals. The chanels runne through the cittie, as the veines of bloud do through a mans body, making in their course here and there innumerable little Hands▪ some natu∣rally▪
and some by art, which are conioyned together by sundry bridges, at least 450 in number, all of free stone, adorned euery where with most princely buil∣dinges, and beautifull pallaces, to which there is most commodious passage both by land and water, there are belonging to these chanels betweene eight and nine thousand little boats, called Gondalas, ready both by day and night, to doe seruice to such as shall set them a worke. The ayre of Venice is exceedingly good, because it The ayre of Venice pure and good. The reasons of the purenes thereof.is continuallie purged with the ebbing and flowing of the tydes, carrying euery six howres away with it what∣soeuer is corrupt or vncleane, besides the multitude of fiers dissolueth al noysome vapours, and the free scope of the windes blowing euery where vnhindered, ma∣keth the ayre most sounde and holesome: besides much is attributed to the saltnes, which being by nature more hot, & lesse colde, engendreth a most equall and sweete temperature, so that straungers with great amazement do not any where beholde men more venerable and of greater age, full of flesh, straight bodyed, of goodly presence, and more vigorous constitution. But aboue all other thinges this is most straunge, that this aire by a speciall priueledge of nature doth agree with the cō∣plections of all such straungers, as resorte thither, of what nation, or vnder what climate soeuer they bee borne, whether the same be subtile and persing, or thick and foggy. Round about them there is taken such innumerable Fish.quantities of all excellent sortes of fish, that not onely the inhabitantes haue plenty of fish taken twise euery day, but they also furnish the adioyning citties vpon
the continent, aswell those that are vnder their domi∣nions, as others. Wildfoule. The like maruelous abundance they haue of wildfoul, so different in kind, and so diuers in colour, that it is straunge to see their seuerall sortes, their variety being such, that wee haue seene aboue 200. seuerall kindes of them painted most exactly in their liuely and naturall colours by Marino Malipero the most exquisite and in∣genious man of his time in that arte. This city aboue all other is most worthy to bee ad∣mired, as being singular by her selfe, and brooking no comparison with any other: for what other citty soe∣uer that hath beene eyther pleasant by situation, or glorious in goodlines of buildinges, yet it had some re∣semblance or likenesse with others. But onely this being seated in the middle of waters, hath not any thing vp∣pō the earth, to which it may be resembled, the rare si∣tuation thereof being such, that it inioyeth both the commodities of the water, and the pleasures of the land, secure by being not seated vpon land, frō land assaults, and free by not being founded in the depthes of the sea, from maritime violence, so that whereas other cit∣ties do keepe and defend their cittizens, with walles, towers and gates, this being naked and without ram∣parts, is not only (as I said) secure it self, but rendreth also with admirable prouidence such citties, secure, as do sleepe vnder the watch of her winges. Steeple of S. Marke. Among many other rare edifices, sumptuous aswell in the richnes of the matter, as maruelous for the most singular curiositie of workemanshippe, he doth infinit∣ly extoll the steeple of S. Marke, the same being so huge high & stately, that in fayre weather it is seen & discer∣ned
of those that do sayle from Istria, being a hundred miles off in distance. The speciall care and ouersight therof is committed alwayes to a man of especiall good quality and reckoning, who hath for his allowance a Marriages.yearely stipend of 150. Crownes. The marriages a∣mong the nobility, are for the most part alwaies treated of by a third person, the bride being neuer suffered so much as to behold her future husband, nor he her, till their marriage dower, and all thinges thereunto apper∣taining, bee fully agreede vpon and concluded, which being done the next morning the Bridegrome goeth to the court of the pallace, & there the match being pub∣lished, receiueth well wishing speeches and salutations from such of the nobility as doe enter into the pallace, and withall inuiteth his frendes to the house of the brides father, to be there at a certain time appointed in the afternoon, at the entry of the dore they are attended by the bridegroom & his kinsemē, & brought vp into a hall, where are none, but only men, & there the bride is brought forth apparelled by an ancient custome all in white, and her haire hanging at her shoulders, wouen in & out with fillets of gold, where being betrothed with many solemne ceremonies, shee is led round about the hall with the sound of flutes and drums, and other in∣struments, and so still dauncing in a soft measure, shee boweth down to those that salute her, hauing so shewed her selfe to them all, shee goeth in, and rerurneth out a∣gain, if any men frends that had not seen her before do chance to come, which being ended, shee descendeth down, and in company of diuers gentlemen, that did all the while attend in seuerall chambers, she entreth in∣to a Gondola, & so being waited on with a great num∣ber
of other Gondals▪ shee goeth vp and downe to the Nunries, especially to those wherein any of her kins∣women is professed, and all this shewing of her selfe a∣broad is to no other end, but that in regarde of her chil∣dren, and fundrie other thinges, it may after happen, she may make her marriage apparant and manifest to all men, at euery marriage there is a gentleman or two chosen, whome they call Compari, that are as it were maisters of the Reuels, because their charge is to see vnto the musicke, and whatsoeuer shewes or pastimes pertaining to the feast, the next morning the friendes and kindred do vse to present the new married couple with sundrie restoratiues and sweet meates. Christninges. Their Christninges are somewhat different from that custome of other places, for the father inuiteth not two godfathers and a godmother, or two godmothers, and a godfather, but as many in māner as they list, insomuch that somtimes there haue been 150 at the christning of the child together in the church, but to the end that this goshipship shold no way be a bar or impedimēt among the Gentlemen, in matter of marriage, it was by a law ordayned, that one gentleman shold not take another gentleman for his goship, whence it commeth that whē the priest powreth the water on the childs head, he first maketh mention of the law, and thē demandeth if there be among the goships any one of the Venetian nobili∣ty, there are not admitted to the ceremony of the christ∣ning any womē but only the nurse that hath the charge of the child; the next day the father sēdeth to euery gos∣sip a marchpane & euery of thē returneth backe some presēt or other to the child, according to the custom of the city: their greatest magnificēce & charge is at the na¦tiuity
of the childe, for then they doe wonderfully ex∣ceede Birth of their childrent.not onely in sumptuousnes of their banquets, but also in rich furniture and decking of their house, and great shewes of riches, and stately plate and siluer vessell. Likewise there is no part of the world, where the fu∣nerals euen of the meanest citizens are solemnized with greater ceremony and expence, neither is there a∣ny country or nation to bee found, where straungers find better entertainement, and liue with greater secu∣rity. Pastimes of the nobiltie. The plaesures, recreations, & pastimes of the gentle∣men are of sundry and diuerse sortes, among the rest, they take great pleasure in fouling, making great mat∣ches, who can kill most foule in a day, turning the ende therof still to banketting and pleasures. They haue boates for the purpose, which they call Fisolares, in re∣garde that the foule in whose pursuit they take greatest pleasure, is called Fisolo, in euery of these boates they haue six or eight seruantes apparrelled in blewish and greenish garmentes, suted as neare as they can to the colour of the water, who row the boate vp and downe, and turne her suddenly to euery side as they are com∣maunded by their Maister, who sitteth close with his peece or bow, wholy intentiue vppon his sporte, if hee chaunce to misse when hee shooteth, the Fisolo pre∣sentlie dyueth vnder the water, and where he riseth a∣gaine, thither they turne their boate, sodenly with pas∣sing nymblenes, many boates go to this pastime, toge∣ther with exceeding charge to the gentlemen that owe them, vpon their return they hang the foule which they haue killed out of the windowes, as hunters do vppon
their dores, the heads of beares, harts, or bores, taking it as a great reputation, to kill more of these in a day then their fellowes. Likewise they haue many wayes, kinds, and instru∣ments to take fish withall, which the gentlemē for their recreation, do take sundry times great delight in. There are also vpon the maine land in the territories of Padoua and Vincentia, but chiefly in Istria, goodly champaignes, faire couertes, and delightfull woodes, full of all manner of chase, whither in few houres they saile from Venice, and apply themselues to hunting and hauking sundry dayes together. Matches of their Dukes. The Duke of Venice hath by auncient priuiledges confirmed from sundry Emperours authority to create Earles & knights, and likewise poets Laureat, with ey∣ther of which dignities their Dukes haue at sundry sea∣sons honoured and rewarded the vertue of such as de∣serued well. The Dukes haue oftentimes matched in the greatest and royallest houses of Christendome, as in their fol∣lowing liues partly shall bee shewed: which allyance with forraine princes of great mightinesse and power, growing suspected and formidable to the common∣wealth, there was a law made in the yeare 1327. that the Duke might not take the daughter of any straunger to his wife, no though by priuiledge and adoption he had obtained the right and tytle of a Venetian gentleman: and in the yeare 1383. it was ordayned, that he shoulde not marry the daughter, sister, or kinsewoman of any forraine prince, without licence and consent from the great councell: and in the yeare 1385. that he should neyther giue nor receyue any fee, of what sort soeuer:
which lawes and ordinances were still from time to time corroborated and kept in vigor. His wife is hono∣red with the tytle of a princesse, & spoken vnto with all reuerence and in stile fitting so great a dignitie. The Dukes in times past were wont in their writing to honour themselues with high and princely styles, as calling themselues Dukes of Venice, Dalmatia, and Croa∣tia, and Lords of a halfe part, & a quarter of the whole Romain Empire, which vanity of titles was in the yeare 1360. absolutely forbidden and taken away, and this manner established, which as yet they do still retaine: viz. I. D. by the grace of God Duke of Venice, &c. Their money is stamped with the inscription of their name, but it is not lawfull for them to ingraue, emborder or paint their peculiar armes in any en∣signes, Banners, Gallies, or places of honour but onely in the frame of the Pallace.
A Breuiate of the History & liues of the Venetian Princes. Pauluccio Anafecto. 1. Duke the yeare 697. PAuluccio Anafecto was a citizen of Heraclia, borne of a noble family, & singularly respected for his wise∣dome and integritie, which caused the people to elect him for their prince. He was inuested in that high honour without any great pompe of ceremony, saue onely that they tooke his oath, that he should alwaies administer iustice sincerely without all partialitie or regarde of persons: who to satisfie the peoples expectations, did presently bend his whole endeuor to his countries good, he ap∣pointed strong guardes euery where vpon the passage of the Lakes which hee fortified with Castelles, com∣manding and imposing vpon euery towne a certayne quantity of armed shippes to bee readie vpon all oc∣casions: hee entred into league with Luitbrand King of Lombardy, obtayning of him many Charters and priuiledges, whereby hee did not onely greatly bene∣fite himselfe, but also his countrymen and subjectes by maintaining himself, & them in the good grace & fauor
of that cruell and barbarous nation. Finally hauing ru∣led 20. yeares, 6. monethes and 8. daies he dyed, leauing behind him an honourable memory of his name, and was buried at Heraclia. Marcello Tegaliano, Duke 2. chosen the yeare 717. ALI the prouinciall Magistrates seeing the benefite receyued by the happy gouernment of their for∣mer Prince: assembled themselues in Heraclea and there by common consent elected in place of the de∣ceased Duke, Marcellus, who was before Captaine, or chiefe of the gentlemen, for though the high and soue∣raigne authority belonged vnto the Duke, yet there were also assistant with him the Tribunes, and the cap∣taine of the gentlemen; the names of which offices were brought first into Italy by the Greekes: He was a man wise in counsell, and valorous in armes. There hapned in his time great and mortall contention betweene the churches of Aquileia and Grado, for the Patriarchshippe and preheminence. He by meanes of Pope Gregory the second, defended the Church and Patriarch of Grado, but Luitbrand king of Lombardie, vpheld and fauoured Serenus the Patriarke of Aquileia. Hauing ruled 9. yeares and 21. dayes, he died in Heraclia. 3. Orso Hipato. Anno 726. TO Marcellus succeeded Orso Hipato, likewise borne of a noble family in Heraclia. He made at the Popes instigation war vpon Luitbrand king of Lombardie, who
had besieged Rauenna, which he relieued, taking Hilde∣brand the kings nephew prisoner, & killing in the field Paredo Duke of Vicenza, but vpon his returne home in a sedition he was most cruelly murdered by his owne ci∣tizens. 4. Theodato Hypato. Anno 742. AFter the death of Orso, the multitude growing into dislike of a princely gouernment, altered the forme therof, electing a magistrate to rule them, whose autho∣ritie should continue onely a yeare, and thn another to be chosen in his place, granting him no farther dignity of title then to be called mayster of the soldiers. The first elected was Dominico Leone, the second Foe∣lice Cornicola, the third Deodatus sonne to Duke Orso, the fourth Giuliano Hypato, the last Iohn Fabriciaco, after the expiration of whose yeare, the people growing in∣to dislike with this kind of gouerument (in respect of a contentious warre that had passed betweene the cities of Heraclia and Sesolo, whereby both the one and the o∣ther wer almost destroyed, assembled themselues at Ma∣lamocco, about the creation again of a new Duke, which was Theodato Hypato, ordayning the seate of his Duke∣dome to be in Malomocco, which as then flourished a∣boue the rest both in riches and number of men. Hee did for a while many notable things to the great liking of his people: but in the end aspiring to reuenge his fa∣ther the last Dukes death, and to that ende fortifying strongly the Castle of Brondolo, the people being incen∣sed by one Galla a seditious person, and made belieue
that he went about to make himselfe an absolute tyrant, tooke him prisoner, & depriued him at once both of his eyes and Dukedome. 5. Galla. Anno 755. AFter him succeeded Galla: but as he got this dignitie by sinister practise, so behauing himselfe wickedly therein, hee was within the yeare taken by the people, depriued of his eyes, and sent into perpetuall banish∣ment. 6. Domenico Monegario. Anno 756. IN his place was elected Domenico Monegario, but withall somewhat to curbe his authority, there were two Tribunes appointed to assist him in the expedi∣tion of all great affaires, but he hauing a fierce and aspiring spirite, contemned the assistance of the Tri∣bunes, insomuch that the people misliking his tiranni∣call manner, deposed him and put out his eyes. 7. Mauritio Galbaia. Anno 764. IN his steed was elected Mauritio Galbaia of a noble fa∣mily of Heraclia, much respected as well for his wise∣dome as his riches. He gouerned with such equitie and loue, that the people to gratifie him, were contented to giue him for companion with equall authoritie in go∣uernment, Giouani his son. At length hauing gouerned the state 23. yeares, he deceased, leauing Giouani his son
alone in the Dukedome, who also shortly after tooke vnto him for partner in gouernment Mauritius his son, who going to Grado by his fathers commission, tooke & spoyled the Citie, and threw the Patriarch headlong from the toppe of a high tower: for reuenge of which wicked crueltie, Obelerius and Fortunatus, nephewes to the Patriarch, entred into conspiracy against the Dukes, drawing vnto them sundry other discontented men, that were of great power: which Dukes hearing pre∣sently fled away, Giouan to Mantouo, and Mauritius into Fraunce, where they ended their liues. 9. Obelerio. Anno 804. AFter them was created Obelerio Antenorio, otherwise called Anafesto, who tooke Beato his brother for com∣panion in gouernment, and as some say, a thirde called Valentino likewise his brother. But at such time as king Pepin made warre vpon the Lakes, they being suspected to haue giuen him secret fauour and assistance, were by a generall consent of the people banished out of the state: vpon which the people did assemble themselues at Ryalto, and there with a most happie beginning did chuse for their Duke in the yeare 809. 10. Angelo Participatio. WHo first builded the Dukes pallace, where it now standeth: he admitted Iustinian his sonne to partnership in rule with him: & lastly after eighteene yeares raigne, and reputation of a good Prince, hee en∣ded his daies, and in his place succeeded him his sonne.
11. Giustitiano Participato. Anno 828. WHo recalled his brother from banishment, to which he had been for his euill demeanor con∣demned, & gaue vnto him equall authoritie with him∣selfe in rule: he sent out a nauie in defence of the king∣dome of Sicilia against the Moores. In his time the bo∣die of S. Marke was brought vnto Venice, for which hee builded a Chappell, and after he founded the Church of S. Zachary. Finally, being oppressed with infirmi∣ties, hee ended his dayes afore hee had full ruled two yeares. 12. Giouani Participatio. Anno 129. GIustinian being dead, the gouernment remained in Giouani his brother, but with harder successe, for he was molested with many vnquiet accidents: for Obele∣rio that before was banished both from the Dukedome and his countrie, returned in armes with sundry of his confederates to Malomocco, raising new broiles, wherein he had at the beginning some successe: but finally the Duke besieged Malomocco, wherin Obelerio had fortified himselfe, and lastly consumed the same with fire, taking Obelerio prisoner, whose head he caused to bee stroken off, & to be picht vpon a stake in the middle of the mar∣ket place. Shortly after one of the Tribunes called Caro∣lo, or as some say, Carosto, by a conspiracie tooke the Dukedome from him, and compelled him to flie: but hee being also shortly chased away and depriued of his eyes by the people, Giouani was recalled backe, who growing into deadly contention & quarrel with
the family of the Mastalitions, being then mighty and puissant, both in riches and authoritie, as also in the number of friends and allyes, was by them againe taken in S. Peters church, and confined to Grado, where sha∣uing his crown, he entred into religion, and finally en∣ded his life. 13. Pietro Gradenigo. Anno 837. PIetro Gradenigo, or as some say Tradonigo, being elec∣ted Duke, tooke vnto him his sonne Giouani to bee partner of his rule, and dignity, he builded the church of S. Paule and made warre vpon the Narantines, hee set out threescore sayle of shippes against the Moores, and finally was slaine by treason in the church of Saint Zacharie. 14, Orso Participatio. Anno 864, AFter this odious murther of the last Duke, Orso Participatio, both in regarde of the happy gouern∣ment of his auncestors, as also of his owne vertue and sufficiency was chosen Duke, who discomfited present∣ly in battell the Sarazens, who had committed greate outrages and spoiles vpon the coast of Dalmatia, hee was by Basilius the Emperour honoured with the ti∣tle of chiefe Swordbearer, and lastly ended his dayes in the yeare 881. 15. Giouani Participatio. Anno 881. HIs Sonne Giouani succeeded him in gouernment, who married a neece of the Emperours of Constan∣tinople, he made warre vpon the Earle of Commachio,
who had way laide and murthered his brother Baldoa∣ro, as he iournyed towards Rome, hee spoiled his coun∣trie, and took the Earle himselfe prisoner, hee accepted with equall authority into the Dukedome his brother Pietro, who dying soone after, hee voluntarily renoun∣ced the Dukedome. 16. Pietro Candiano. Anno. 887. ANd in his place was chosen Pietro Candiano, who in a battell soon after against the Narantines was slain, and his body brought to Grado, where it was buried, vpon his death, the people requested Giouani Participa∣tio to take vpon him the rule againe, which with greate vnwillingnesse hee did, but hauing therein continu∣ed aboute halfe a yeare, at his instant pursuite, he was thereof againe released. 17. Pietro Tribuno. Anno. 888. ANd in his place was elected Pietro Tribuno: hee for∣tified Venice by drawing of a wall from the riuer of Castello to Sancta Maria Zebenico, though there remaine not now of the same any token at all, he vanquished the Hunnes, ouerthrew Berengarius the Emperour, and dyed full of glorie and happinesse. 18. Orso Parcicipatio. Anno. 912. ORso Participatio; or as some call him, Orso Baduaro, second of that name succceded him, a man sin∣gularly wise, religious, a louer of iustice, an
Almes-giuer, of great courage, and accomplished in e∣uery requisite vertue, he had a sonne called Pietro, who was of the Emperour Corradus honored with great dig∣nities, and especially with priueledge to coyne money, but finally being wearie of the worldes vanitie, and tur∣ning himselfe wholy to contemplation, hee voluntarily renounced the Dukedome, and entred into religion in the Monastery of S. Foelix in Ainiano. 19. Pietro 11 Candiano. Anno 932. TO Orso succeeded Pietro Candiano sonne to Duke Pietro that was slaine in Dalmatia by the Sclauo∣nians, a man of great modesty and fitnes to gouerne: his sonne Pietro was created chief Swordbearer of the Empire, hee tooke and burned Commachoo, hee made warre vpon the Istrians, and made Iustmopolis tributary to the state of Venice, he dyed the seuenth yeare of his rule. 20. Pietro Participatio. Anno 939. PIetro Participatio or Badoaro, hauing beene prisoner with the Istryans, vpon his return was created Duke, and dyed in the second yeare of his rule, to the excee∣ding sorrow of his Cittizens. 21. Pietro Candiano. Anno 942. IN his place was chosen Pietro Candiano thirde of that name, sonne to Pietro the second, he had two sonnes Dominico and Pietro, the first hee made Bishop of Torcel∣lo & the other, hee tooke to be his partner in the Duke∣dome,
who behauing himselfe insolently, and being thereof reprehended by him, tooke publikely armes a∣gainst him, but the people reuerencing the authority & withall pittying the age and griefe of the Father, pursu∣ed the sonne so sharpely, that they tooke him, and had slaine him, had not the olde man vsed great instance to saue him from their fury, in the end to satisfie the father they spared his life, but sent him into banishment, so∣lemnly swearing all with one consent, that they woulde neuer admit him for their prince, neither during the life of his father, neither after his death, the yong man fled to the Marquis Guiao, son to king Berengario, of whom he was with great humanity receiued and presented to the king his father, who tooke him with him to the warre of Spoleto, thence with the kinges leaue getting himselfe to Rauenna, and there arming certaine ships, he tooke seuen rich ships of Venice laden with marchan∣dize, that were sayling to Fano, the griefe of whose vn∣naturall disposition and vndutifull behauiour, so grie∣ued the olde man that he dyed in the yeare, 959. 22. Pietro Candiano. Anno 959. THe people being assembled together, aboute the choice of a new prince, so strangely were the minds of the Bishop and the multitude chaunged, that where∣as by solemne oath, they had once vowed neuer to liue vnder the gouernment of young Pietro, now they did not desire any thing with greatervehemence, insomuch that they went to fetch him from Rauenna to Venice in triumphes with 200. sayle, inuesting him presentlie in the roya ltie of their Dukedome, hee put away his first
wife Giouanna, and married the Lady Voldrada, daugh∣ter to Marquis Guido, whose dowry was great and rich, Girolomie Bardi. calleth her Vadetta & sayeth that she was daughter to Alberto L. of Rauenna.not onely in mony and Iewels,, but also in Castles, and fortresses, insomuch that growing insolent therewith, hee called in mercenarie souldiers to the guard of his pallace and person, in fine his manners were so outragi∣ous, and himselfe grew so odious to the people, that as∣sēbling themselues in a fury they slew both him & his little sonne within his pallace, which they burned to the ground. 23. Pietro Orseolo. Anno. 976. THis great outrage being committed, they elected Pietro Orseolo for their prince, who being of a noble family, and from his youth wholy giuen to deuotion, was maruelous vnwilling to accept this high dignitie, fearing least the same wold be a hinderance to the con∣templature life, which he chiefly desired, he had by his wife Foelicia one sonne and no more, like to him both in name and condition, he repayred the church of S. Mark, and the walles of Grado, and succoured Bari against the Sarazens, at length falling into acquaintance with one Guarino Abbot of S. Michaels of Cusano in Gascoyne, hee grew so farre in loue with the reuerence of his person, and the integrity of his conditions, that determining to abandon the world, hauing first distributed great gifts among the poore, he departed one night in disguised garments with the said Giouani, which Giouani Gradinigo and Giouani Morosmo his sonne in law, and Romualdo, & Marino of Rauenna, without saying a word thereof ey∣ther to his wife or sonne, he tooke with him much mo∣ney
which he bestowed in adorning the church of S. Michaell, wherein hee made himselfe Monke, and at the end of nineteene yeares dyed not without fame of do∣ing many miracles, hee was aged fifty yeares when hee entered into religion. 24. Vitale Candiano. anno. 978. THe flight of Duke Orseolo being discouered, Vitale Candiano sonne to Pietro the third, was substituted in his place, but falling into a grieuous infirmitie, he re∣nounced the Dukedome, vowing that (if he recouered) to make himselfe a Fryer, which hee performed, and afterward comming to end his dayes, hee was buried in the Church of S. Hilary. 25. Tribuno Memo, anno. 479. TRibuno Memo beingelected Duke, was so vexed with ciuill discord, that was betweene the two mightie families of the Morasins, and Calopins, that renouncing the Dukedome, he betooke himselfe to religion, wher∣in he shortly finished his dayes, and was buried in Saint Zacharies church. 26. Pietro Orseolo. anno 991. IN his place was chosen Pietro Orseolo, sonne to that other Pietro, whose life was so religious and holy, he Conquered in a manner all Dalmatia, and hauing done many other notable thinges, especially in erection of Churches and sumptuous monumentes for Saintes, hee dyed in the eighteenth yeare of his rule. 27. Ottone Orseolo. anno. 1009
SVch was the peoples loue to the Father, that they confirmed the gouernment to his sonne Ottone, be∣ing a young man of eighteene yeares of age, but of a very goodly personage, and of a most exeellent spirite, he married the sister of Geta king of Hungarie, hee was excellentlie learned, and of great liberality, but in the end by the conspiracie & practise of Dominico Flabanico hee was driuen out of Venice, and confined to Constan∣tinople in the seuenteenth yeare of his rule, where short∣ly after hee dyed. 28.

Domenico Flabanico, anno. 1032. DOmenico Flabanico by reason of many yeares & long experience was well acquainted with the world, and subtle in his proceedings, he ordained by a general consent of the rest that thence forward no Duke might
admit any partner in gouernment, and withall that none of the Orseoles might euer after bee capable of the Du∣call dignitie, hee ruled openly tenne yeares. 30. Domenico Contarino. Anno 1043. DOmenico Contarini was with exceeding content∣ment of the whole people elected Duke, being of a noble family, and withall of a very gentle and curte∣ous disposition, he did many notable thinges, and dy∣ed in the 26. yeare of his rule. 31.

Pietro Polani. Anno 1130. PIetro Polani sonne in law to the former Duke, began his rule in the yeare 1131. a man so singularly respec∣ted for his wisedome and integritie, that the Emperors Corradus and Emanuel did chuse him for an Vmpier and Arbitrator of such differences as were betweene them: hee conquered Fano, and ouerthrewe those of Padoua and Pisa. Lastly, in assembling a mighty nauie in fauor of Emanuel the Emperour, he fell sicke and died. 37. Domenico Morosmi. Anno 1148.

SEbastiano Zani was the first that was elected by xi. persons, appointed therunto by the people: so that his election was orderly, & not with tumult, as that of the former princes: he was 70. yeares old, when hee was chosen: his countenance and disposition was plea∣sant, and his riches great beyond measure. He was the first that at his election threw money about the streets, according to the custome of the Greekish Emperours: the same to this day being still obserued in Venice. By his meanes there were created also certaine Magistrates with high authoritie, somewhat thereby to bridle the puissance of the Dukes, being afore that time in man∣ner absolute, as namely the sixe Counsellors. In his time Pope Alexander the third came vnto Ve∣nice, being chased out of Rome by Frederic Barbarossa the Emperour, in whose defence the Venetians made wars vpon the Emperour with a mighty nauie, with which they discomfited his fleet vpon the coast of Istria, taking
Otto his third sonne being Generall thereof prisoner, by whose intercession and means to his father, there was an attonement concluded, the Emperour appeased, & the Pope againe restored with all solemnity to his dignity: insomuch that the Emperour came in person to Venice, and there in the church of S. Marke, putting off his im∣periall garmentes, bowed himselfe downe to kisse the Popes feet who keeping in the meane time his grauity, pronounced the wordes of the Prophet: Super Aspidem & basiliscum ambulabis, & conculcalbis Leonem & Draco∣nem: to which the Emperour aunswered, Non tibi sed Petro: the Pope presently replying, Et mihi & Petro. Afterwardes the Pope in acknowledging the fauors that hee had receiued of the Signeory of Venice, did ho∣nour the same againe with many benedictions, priui∣ledges and ceremonious dignities, as a sword, a scepter, a chayre of gold, a torch of Virgin waxe, all sanctified with many blessings, stil thence after to be borne before the Duke, & among the rest vpō the victorie obtayned by the Duke at sea against the Emperours son, he gaue the ring which he ware vpon his finger vnto the Duke, with expresse condition, that hee should yearely with such a ring spouse the sea, in token of a true and perpe∣tual dominion ouer the same, which ceremonie is euen till this time obserued with great solemnitie euery As∣cention day. Besides these the Pope granted many & great indulgences to the church of S. Martin in Venice, & to S. Iohns church in Istria. The Signeorie of Venice afore this time was vnacquainted with those externall pomps & honorable titles, which by prerogatiue frō the Pope they then obtained, & from that time to this haue strictly obserued. In fine this prince hauing by many
notable deedes exceedingly enobled his country, dyed full of glory, in the sixt yeare of his rule: leauing by te∣stament a great and infinit riches to the Signeorie of S. Marke: vnderneath his picture in the pallace is writ∣ten this inscription. Ducatum titulis dotaui ingentibus atque Papa liber minis, fit Frederice tuis. 40. Orio Mastropetro. Anno 1178.

Henrico Dandolo. Anno 1192. THe next elected was Henrico Dandolo, a man aged in yeares, but fresh in courage, and highly honoured for his great deserts: he recoured Raguse to the Signeo∣rie, and hauing done many notable things, dyed in the 13. yeare of his rule at Constantinople. 42. Pietro Zani. Anno 1205. PIetro Zani son to Sebastian, succeeded with election and generall approbation of the whole Citie: in his
time came Ambassadors from Athens to doe homage & obedience to the senate: he married the Ladie Constance daughter to Tancredi King of Sicilia. In his time were the foure horses of brasse that are yet to be seeene in S. Marke, sent from Constantinople to Venice: it is certaine∣ly written, that they were caste and engrauen by Luip∣pus the famous workeman, and giuen to the Romaines by Tyridates King of Armenia, and from Rome brought at last to Constantinople, by Constantine the Emperour. Fi∣nally the Duke gaue vp his dignitie, & putting himselfe to a priuate life, died after the 24. yeare of his Duke∣dome. 43. Iacomo Thiepolo. Anno. 1229. IN his roome was enstalled Iacomo Theopolo.

recouered the Empire of Constantinople: he dyed in the 16. yeare of his rule. 46. Lorenzo Thiepolo. Anno 1268. IN place of this last Duke was chosen Lorenzo Thiepolo, sonne to Iacomo the Duke: being at that time Gouer∣nor of Fano. He married a young Lady of a great and noble house in Dalmatia: he maried his two sonnes Ia∣como & Pietro to two great Ladies, the first to a princesse of Slauonia, Lady of many Castels and townes, and the other to a Lady of great riches and nobility in Vicensa: which forraigne alliances were no whit at all pleasing to the Senate, insomuch that after his death they made a law, whereby they restrained both the prince and his children from allying themselues by mariage, with strangers: in his time Fano, Bologna, and other borde∣ring cities reuolted from the state of Venice, but they were by him chastised & brought againe to obedience: at the end of sixe yeares he dyed, and was buried in the same tombe with his father in the church of S.

renounced the Dukedome, who prouiding him of ho∣nourable meanes to liue, created in his place, 48. Giouani Dandolo. Anno 1280. THe enstalment of this Prince was memorable, by meane of two great and dangerous accidents that presently ensued, the one by the swelling and inunda∣tion of waters, the other by a terrible earthquake, eyther of which did exceedingly endamage the state: in his time were coyned the first duckets of Gold, which are now called Zechines. He died in the tenth yeare of his rule. 49. Petro Gradenigo. Anno 1290. NEuer was there any Duke of greater expectation & hope then this Petro Gradenigo, as being in deed a man of rare & singular courage, wisedome & eloquence: at his first entrance inot gouernment hee suppressed a great and dangerous conspiracie intended against him: he fought at the first prosperously by sea with the Geno∣weses, but afterwardes was by them ouerthrowen in Dalmatia, and likewise in the streightes of Gallipolis, after which there was a peace concluded: in time of this Duke it was ordained that none should bee capable of the Dukedome by election, vnlesse he were of the great councell, likewise then was first the beginning of the councell of the tenne: he sent a nauie into Greece, which returned victoriously with many prisoners, and rich spoiles, after which he dyed, not without the suspition of poyson: his body was carried to Murano, and there buried in the church of S.

Francesco Dandolo. Anno 1328. IN his place was elected Francesco Dandolo: in whose time there was at one instant threescore sundry Am∣bassadors from seuerall princes and commonwealths in Venice, desiring to haue such controuersies as were a∣mong them ended and decided by the Senate, such was then the same of the vncorrupted iustice of the Fa∣thers. He made a league with sundry christian princes a∣gainst the Turke: he had wars with the Princes of Scala, with whom in the end hee made peace to his owne ad∣uantage: he liued in rule 11. yeares. 53. Bartolomeo Gradenigo. Anno 1339. ANd in his steed Bartholomeo Gradenigo was created Duke, vpon whose entring into gouernment, the waters arose so high, that the city was in exceeding dan∣ger of drowning.

54. Andrea Dandolo anno 1343. THe next that was honored with this dignitie was Andrea Dandolo, procurator of S. Marke, a man ve∣ry wise and learned, and hauing before time proceeded Doctor in the lawes, he wrote a very large and copi∣ous Chronicle, not onely of his owne Country, but also of the whole world, hee liued in deare and famili∣ar frendship with Petrarke, he confederated himself with Pope Clement and sundry other Princes: hee sent a na∣uy against the Turkes, which tooke Smyrna, he obtai∣ned trafficke for Venetian marchantes into Aegypt, hee liued twelue years, and had vnder his picture in the pal∣lace this inscription.

NExt in ranke was exalted to the Dukedome with exceeding fauour of the one and forty Electors, Marino Faliero, hauing long before by the Senate beene employed in forraine gouernments, and besides ennobled with the title of Earle of Val de Marino, hee was 80. yeares olde, very rich, of an excellent wit, well speaking, but passionat and cholerike beyond measure, insomuch that for a scorne or wrong, which hee imagi∣ned to beedone to his reputation, he entred into a prac∣tise to tyrannize ouer his countries liberty, and to make himselfe absolute prince, rather as they write, moued thereunto with a humor of reuenge, then desire of do∣minion,
being without children, and withall so aged: but the end was, hee was taken and beheaded in the very same place, where he receiued the Ducal diademe, his picture was not suffered to stand in the Pallace a∣mong the others, the place remaining yet bare and void where it should haue stoode. 56. Giouaui Gradenigo. anno 1355. THe former vnhappy prince being buried, and his conspiracie being suppressed in a manner before it was publikely known, Giouani Gradenigo was chosen in his place, a mā of 76. years of age, of profound memory, and skilfull in the lawes, but vnseemely of his person, & withall somewhat noted of couetousnes, hee liued on∣ly a yeare, three monethe; and foutteene dayes. 57, Giouani Delfino. anno 1356.

Andrea Contarini anno 1367. ANdrea Contarini being exceedingly loath to accept this dignitie, and to that end withdrawing himselfe to Padoua, was neuerthelesse elected by the Fathers, and constrained to take vpon him the gouernment, which he did with great comfort to the citie, but with marue∣lous discouragement to himselfe, because it had beene foretold him, that whensoeuer hee should come to bee Duke, the commonwealth shold labour with extreame affliction to preuent which hee bent his whole ende∣uour and care to the well discharging of his dignity: but diuine deliberations are not to bee resisted, for not long after he found himself entangled with many dan∣gerous warres, as with the Tryestines, and Leopola Duke of Austria, and with Francisco de Carrara a most sharpe and bitter enemie to the very name of the Veneti∣ans, who had contracted against them a League, which the King of Hungarie, the Patriarke of A∣quilia, and the whole commonwealth of Genoua;
insomuch that besides a general reuolution and change of Fortune through the whole state, the Genoweses encroched so neare vpon Venice, that they tooke from it the cittie of Chroggia, threatning vtter ruine and sub∣uersion to the whole state: but in this greatest downe∣fall and calamitie, such was the constant vertue and resolute courage of the Venetians and their prince, that assembling the remainder of their force together, they assailed with such fiercenesse the Genoweses in Chrog∣gia, that they did not onely recouer the cittie, but also discomfit their enemies in a famous ouerthrow, to the maruelous glorie of their Duke, who was there in per∣son, they brought backe with them to Venice, 4142 Ge∣nowes prisoners, who in manner all ended there their liues, and 2600. Padowans; besides the Duke brought with him among many other ensignes, banners and standardes, the shield of the Captaine generall of the Genoweses, as a chiefe Trophei, the same being made of hardned leather, according to the fashion of that time, but very gorgeously guilted and embosted with the picture vpon it of S.

Michaell Morosimi anno. 1381, MIchaell Morosimi, dyed the fourth moneth of his
rule of the plague, vnder his picture in the pallace is written. Paucadamus patriaefestina morte repressi. 62. Antonio Veniero. anno 1381.

Pietro Mocenigo anno 1474. PIetro Mocenigo being procurator of S. Marke, and of the age of 69. years, was chosen in his room, he had spent the greatest part of his yeares in great and princi∣pal employments abroad for the commōwealth, chief∣ly in the wars, wherof there is a particular treatise writ∣ten by Coepio Coriolan, that liued in those times, he liued onely 14. monethes after his enstalment. 71 Andrea Vendramino. anno 1476. ANdrea Vendramino was 84. years of age when he was elected Duke, he had beene in his youth one of the most beautifull and comely Gentlemen of Venice, and in all respects accordingly accomplished, hee made war against the Turke, and defended Croy in Albana, which they had besieged, constraining them to raise their siege with great ouerthrow and discomfiture, but while there was a treaty of peace entertayned, the Duke de∣parted this life in the 20. moneth after his election. 72.

Augustino Barbarico anno 1485. AƲgustino Barbarico was elected to succeede his bro∣ther Marco, he banded with the other Italian prin∣ces against Charles eight of Fraunce, then newly by soli∣citation of Lodowicke, Sforce entred into Italy, for the recouery of the kingdome of Naples, to which he pre∣tended title in his time, the Portugals first found out the voyaging into the Indies, to the exceeding pre∣iudice of Venice, who before had thence al their spices, with which in a manner they furnished all the western prouinces of Christendome, hee dyed in the 15. yeare of his Dukedome, and in his place was elected. 75. Leonardo Loridano. anno 1501. NEuer was the commonwealth of Venice nearer to shipwracke, then in this princes time, for the grea∣test princes of Christendome did solemnly at Cambray combine themselues in league against their state, as the Pope, the Emperour, the king of Fraunce, the king of Spaine, and the Dukes of Mantua and Ferrara, euery one of which powred down armies vpon them, they were ouerthrowne in a memorable battell at Ghiara∣dada, and in an other at Vincensa, so that they were faine to abandon in a manner, al that they possessed vpon the firme land, to be shared and diuided by the Conque∣rours, yet neuertheles fortune turned about her wheele againe in such sort that they recouered themselues, wherein the histories of that time do attribute excee∣ding
much to the wisedome and vertue of their prince. Finally, being nere to 90. yeares of age, hee fell into an infirmitie by reason of a fall which he had receyued, & dyed in the yeare 1521. His body was honourably en∣tombed in the Church of S. Iohn and S. Paule. 76. Antonio Grimani. Anno 1521. ANtonio Grimani had beene first a Procurator, and de∣priued of that dignity, and banished to Cherso, yet afterward was recalled againe, and restored to his first dignitie, and shortly after elected Duke, which honour he enioyed onely a yeare, two monthes and two dayes, and then dyed. 77. Andrea Gritti. Anno 1523. IN his place was elected Andrea Gritti, a man in deed excellent in all prefection, & worthy of that dignity. The great matters that passed in his time are so excel∣lently and copiously written by Giouius, & Guicciardin, and others of that time, that it were in vaine here to make any abridgement of them. He ruled 15. yeares & seuen monthes, and then dyed at the age of 83. yeares. 78. Pietro Lando. Anno 1538. PIetro Lando being confirmed Duke maintayned his commonwealth neutrall betweene Charles the Emperour, and Francis the French King, who were in∣tangled together in a most fierce and cruell warre, and thought there was scarcely any prince in Christendome but followed the one side or other, yet neuer coulde they notwithstanding many earnest solicitations made by them both draw the state of Venice to fauour the one more then the other. Hauing ruled 7. yeares he dyed. 79. Francesco Donato. An. 1545. FRancesco Donato, being Procurator of S. Marke, was a man of great eloquence, & singular capacity of spirit
and therefore his election applauded of the multitude with great ioy: he did many laudable things, and lastly died in the seuenth yeare of his rule, and was succeded by Marcantonio Treuisano. 80. Marcantonio Treuisano. Anno 1553. THis Duke was maruellously religious, iust in all his words and actions, and of so extraordinary a chari∣tie towards the poore, that he gaue them (in a manner) all that hee had: neuerthelesse his end was strange and pitifull, for at the end of his first yeare he fell downe so∣dainly dead as he was kneeling before the altar at Masse, the inscription vnder his picture in the pallace is thus. Religionis amantissimus, Anno circn̄acto moriens in gre∣mio patrum ante aras in celum vnde veneram, vitae inte∣ger euolaui. 81. Francesco Veniero Anno. 1554. THe next placed in the Ducall throne was Francesco Veniero, being then 64. yeares of age: he liued one∣ly two years, & in his place was elected Lorenzo Priuli. 82. Lorenzo Priuli. Anno 1556. LOrenzo Priuli was a man wholly giuen to religion & quietnesse: there was no great thing done in the time of his Dukedome, which he onely enioyed three yeares, and then departed this world. 83. Hieronimo Priuli. Anno 1559. HIeronimo Priuli, as wel in regard of his owne vertue as the happy and quiet gouernment of his brother Lorenso, was with generall applause established in his roome. In his time was celebrated the Councell of Trente: he died in the 8. yeare of his rule. 84. Pietro Loredano. Anno 1567. PIetro Loredano was a senator of great grauitie, wise, re∣ligious, and of singular integritie and soundnesse in
his actions: in his time the famous Arsenall of Venice, wherein all their store of powder & munition was con∣tained, was casually set on fire; the noise whereof was so extremely hideous, that it was heard 40. miles off: pre∣sently also ensued the calamitous war of Selim Emperor of the Turks, who vpon the death of his father Soliman, aspiring to some honourable conquest, tooke armes a∣gainst the Senate, pretending title to the kingdome of Cypres, vtterly forgetting his fathers admonitions, his promise made to the Senate, and the long amitie that had beene betweene them. In fine hee inuaded Cypres with a mighty armie, & tooke after long siege the two great Citties of Nicosia & Famagosta, practising all kinds of imaginable crueltie vppon the poore Christian cap∣tiues: in the meane time while the Venetians were bu∣sied in preparation of forces to encounter him, the Duke not able to withstand the affliction of age, sick∣nesse and so many troubles, yeelded vp his breath in his fourth yeare of gouernment. 85. Aluigi Mocenigo. Anno 1570. THe next thought worthy of this high honour, was Aluigi Mocenigo, a man accomplished in all vertues that to so great a dignitie were requisite: he appointed Sebastiano Veniero Generall of the Venetian forces, to v∣nite himselfe with Marc-Antonia Colona, Generall for the Pope, & D. Iohn d' Austria for the king of Spaine, who together gaue that mighty and memorable ouerthrow to the Turkes at Lepanto, in manner in the very place where Augustus Caesar vanquished Anthony his Compe∣titor. In his time Henry the third, King of Fraunce re∣turning vppon the newes of his brothers death out of Polonia passed through Venice, where being ariued, he
was receiued and entertained of the Duke and Senate with maruellous ioy, pompe and magnificence. Final∣ly, this Duke to the great discomfort of the common∣wealth died in the seuenth yeare of his rule. 86. Sebastiano Veniero. Anno 1577. PResently vpon the death of Mocenigo, Sebastiano Ve∣niero, in reward of his glorious victorie against the Turkes, was without contradiction of any of the Elec∣tors enstalled in the Dukedome, with greater gratula∣tion and applause then euer before time had beene seen at the election of any former Duke. The Pope sent a solemne ambassage to congratulate with him, and with∣all sent him in token of his worthinesse and vertue, the Rose of Gold, a present neuer sent but to mighty prin∣ces, and such as had employed themselues in the chur∣ches defence: but all this honour and his life also ended within a yeare, after that hee had receiued the Ducall diademe, euen at such time as hee was busie about the preparation of a sumptuous and triumphall feast, which he intended to make in honor of his wife, the princesse Cecilia Contarina. The Archduke of Austria in admirati∣on of his vertue sent an Ambassador of purpose to the Senate to demand his picture. 87. Nicolo da Ponte. Anno 1578. NIcolo da Ponte was fourescore and eight yeares olde at time of his election: he was a Doctor of Law, a knight and Procurator of S. Marke, and had passed with exceeding commendation through all the offices and dignities of his commonwealth. He died in the yeare 1585. and in his place was elected Pasqual Cenoca. 88. Pasqual Cenoca. 1585. FINIS.
