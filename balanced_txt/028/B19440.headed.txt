royal blazon or coat of arms DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King. A PROCLAMATION Concerning the Adjournment of Michaelmas Term. CHARLES R. THe King our Soveraign Lord considering the great and general Infection of the Plague, which at this present is in the Cities of London and Westminster, & other places near adjoyning, and how perillous it might be to His loving Subjects if they should be inforced to repair thither for their Suits and Causes, before such time as it shall please Almighty God of his goodness and mercy to remove or cease that heavy Visitation; His Majesty therefore of His special Grace and Favour to His people, and for their better Safety and Preservation, is pleased to adjourn part of this Term of St. Michael now next coming; (That is to say) in and from the first Return thereof, called Tres Michaelis, unto the fifth Return of the same Term, called Octabis Sancti Martini, from Westminster to Oxford in the County of Oxford, and there to be held and continued for the residue of the said Term: which His Maje∣sty signifieth to all His loving Subjects of this Realm, to the intent they which have Cause or Commandment to ap∣pear in any of His Highness Courts at Westminster, in, or at any day or time in or after the said Tres Michaelis, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause, before the said Octabis Sancti Martini next coming, and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt to incur to∣wards His Majesty in that behalf. And nevertheless His Majesties Pleasure is, That according to the ancient Order of the Laws, the Essoynes of the said Tres Michaelis shall be kept; at which time Writs of Adjournment (which His Majesty commandeth the Lord High Chancellour of England to make forth) shall be directed to the Iustices of either Bench, and to the Iudges of all other His Majesties Courts, to whom like Writs have been usually directed, giving them power to Adjourn the next Michaelmas Term, in and from Tres Michaelis unto the said Fifth Return as aforesaid. And the said Adjournment to be made in the First day of the said Tres Michaelis, commonly called the day of Essoynes. And His Majesty doth hereby declare His further Will and Pleasure to be, That in the said Term there shall be no Tri∣als by Iuries, or any Iudgement upon Demurrers, or Special Verdicts in any of His Courts of Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer. And that all Matters, Causes, and Suits depending between party and party in His other Courts of Chancery, Exchequer-Chambers, or Dutchy of Lancaster, shall have continuance, and the parties shall have day from the Date of these Presents, until the said Fifth Return as aforesaid. And also, That there shall be no Iudicial Hearings, or determining of any causes, or matters in any of the said Courts of Chancery, Exchequer-Chambers, or Dutchy of Lancaster, during the said Term. And His Majesty doth hereby also further Declare, That no party shall be compelled, or need to appear in person in any of His Majesties said Courts, at any time during the said Term, but may make their appearance by their Attorneys (saving only in Cases of Outlawry) And that no Iuries, or any whom the same may concern, shall be compelled, or need to appear in any of His Majesties said Courts, at any time during the said Term, for any Cause or Matter whatsoever, unless it be for some special and important Cause for his Majesties service only. And whereas His Majesty having removed the Receipt of His Exchequer, together with the Tally-Office, and all things thereunto belonging, from Westminster to His Honour of Nonsuch in the County of Surrey, did by His Proclamation of the 26th of July last, direct all Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Collectors, and other Officers, Accomptants, and persons whatsoever, who were to pay in any Moneys into the said Receipt, or otherwise to attend the same, to keep their days and times at Nonsuch aforesaid, and there to pay and perform in all things as they should or ought to have done at Westminster, until His Majesty should declare his Pleasure to the contrary. Now His Majesties pleasure is, and he doth hereby direct and command, That His said Receipt of Exchequer, together with the ally-Office, and all things thereunto belonging, shall be continued and kept at Nonsuch aforesaid, until His Majesty shall declare His further Pleasure to the contrary; whither all persons whom the same doth concern, may take notice to repair upon all occasions, for, or concerning the bringing in, or issuing out of His Majesties Treasure at the Receipt of His Exchequer. Provided, and His Majesty com∣mands all Collectors, Receivors, Sheriffs, and other Accomptants, and all other persons that should or ought to Accompt in any of His Majesties Courts of Exchequer, or Dutchy of Lancaster, or to enter into any Accompt in either of the said Courts, or otherwise to attend the same, to repair unto Oxford at the time aforesaid, and there to Accompt, and to perform in all things touching their Accompts, as though no such Proclamation or Adjournment had been had or made. And His Majesties further Pleasure & Commandment is, That if any person or persons who ought to Accompt or Pay any sum or sums of money to His Majesty in any of the Courts & Places aforesaid, do make default therein, then his Highness Writs and Process shall be awarded, and sent forth against every such person and persons; and the same to be duly and orderly served and returned by the Sheriffs and Officers thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form as the same should have been if this or the said former Proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff, or other Officer shall make default, or be negligent in Serving Executing or Returning of any of the Writs and Pro∣cesses aforesaid. That then every such Sheriff and other Officer shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the said Courts or any of them shall be Taxed and Assessed. Willing and Commanding all and every His Majesties She∣riffs, Officers Ministers and Subjects to whom it doth or shall appertain, to observe and keep their Assemblies and Appearances with all their Returns and Certificates, in his Highness said Court at Oxford, in Octàbis Sancti Martini next coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to do their Offices and Duties in every behalf, in like man∣ner and form, as they should or ought to have done if this present Proclamation had not been had or made, as they will answer to the contrary at their perils. Given at Oxford the Six and twentieth day of September, in the Seventeenth year of His Majesties Reign. God save the King.
