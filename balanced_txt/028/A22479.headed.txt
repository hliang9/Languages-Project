And heereof euery one whom it doeth or may concerne, are to take notice, and duely to obserue the same, as they tender Our heauie displeasure, and will answere their neglect thereof, at their vttermost perils. Giuen at Our Court at Portesmouth, the three and twentieth day of Iuly, in the fourth yeere of Our Reigne, of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by BONHAM NORTON and IOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. M.DC.XXVIII.
