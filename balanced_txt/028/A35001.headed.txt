TO THE READER. THough the Writer of these Sermons doth out of modesty decline to Print his name, yet he is very willing to give all reasonable satisfaction to any sober Inquirer; that he has not in the least al∣tered or imposed upon the Authors sense, either in the Taking or Transcribing of them; And he does further assure the Reader, that he neither is, nor ever was one of those People called Quakers; but always of another Persuasion; Yet being willing according to the Apostles Rule, to Try all things; he has sometimes been pre∣sent at their Meetings, and having the Art of Short Writing, he has Taken many of their Sermons and Prayers from the Mouths of di∣vers of their Preachers, and among others, those of Mr. Stephen Crisp deceased, which upon Review appeared to him, as well as to three or four other eminent Persons of another
Way, to contain so many Gospel ruths, deli∣vered with such Plainness, Zeal and Demon∣stration, and generally agreeable to the known Doctrines of Christianity, that it is hoped the Publishing of them may be useful to the World: And that the Design and Intent of them may be the more readily comprehended, there is a Title given to every Sermon, agree∣able to the Subject Matter Chiefly Treated of. If any desire to be further satisfied by speak∣ing with the Writer, they may be gratified therein by applying themselves to the Book∣seller, Nath. Crouch.
Sermon I. The Great Mediator of the Everlasting Covenant. Preached at Grace-Church-Street, April 25. 1688. My Friends, HOW should we all admire the work∣ings of the Holy Ghost? You may know from your own Experience, that all the Operations of the Holy Spirit from the beginning, have been in Or∣der to the Cleansing, and Purifying, and Pre∣paring you for the Kingdom of God: This Experience is given to a little Remnant, of the the manner of his working, that the End, Aim and Dsign of all the Operations of his Powr, is for our good, and in order to our E∣ternal Happiness. Now this is a great ingagement upon the minds of the People of God, diligently to
wait upon him, that they may be opened more and more into the Mystery of Life and Salvation, that hath been hid from Ages, and Generations, and is now revealed by his Spirit. And they that are thus exercised, with the measure of Grace given unto them, they do grow and increase, in Holiness and Righ∣teousness, by the working thereof; and they increase in Knowledge in the great things of his Law, and the Mysteries of the King∣dom of Grace, that the Eye which God hath opened, may discern that the working of his Power in all Ages, has been for the Extir∣pating, Rooting out, and Destroying of that Root of Iniquity, that hath brought forth such a Crop of Sin, and Wickedness, which was not of his Planting, nor of his Creating. For from the beginning of the Creation of God, unto this day, God hath had a singu∣lar Love, and Favour to the Sons, and Daughters of Men, as being (as I may say) the Master-piece, or greatest piece of the Creation, most nearly related to himself; Created in his own Image, in Righteousness and Holiness; and in that they now are not so, but Marred, and Spoiled from bearing the Heavenly Image, is not the Lords doing,
but hath been wrought by the Enemy both to God and Man; And the Lord continu∣ing his Love unto the Work of his hands, hath from Age to Age, Revealed, and made Known hss Power, for the restoring and bringing back again Lost Man, Fallen Man, Sinful Man, to be Reconciled unto him; that he might, as was intended, Enjoy and Possess the Love and Favour of his Maker; but there was no possibility found for his Reconciliation with the Holy God, but by making him Holy: For as the mak∣ing him Unholy, separated him from his Maker; So the making of him Holy again, would Unite him again unto his Maker; So that there must be a way, and means for the Reducing of him to his Primitive State, before he could enjoy and obtain his Primi∣tive Enjoyments, that is, the Love, and Favour of God: And there hath been a General Universal sense upon the Sons and Daughters of Men, of this Alienation, and Estrangedness from God; and they have put themselves upon divers ways, and me∣thods to obtain Reconciliation, and to try if they could restore themselves, and they have found out ways, and tryed and prov∣ed the Inventions, and Imaginations of their own Minds, in their fallen Wisdom, what
they might do to please God, and be Recon∣ciled to him. We are Sinners, and we will Sacrifice, we will bring a Sacrifice for our Sins; and when they have brought a Sacrifice, it hath not been accepted, because there hath not been a Mediator known, that might Medi∣ate for them with the Lord; so that all the Sacrifices they have Offered have never been accepted with him, in order to an Attone∣ment and Reconciliation: Now only those that have Relation to the Mediator by Faith in him, doth he Intercede for, that he might present them again to God; and this hath been the difference between Sacrificer, and Sacrificer, from the days of Cain and Abel, unto this day. Some have had Rela∣tion to the Mediator in all their Services, and Sacrifices, and some have had Relation only to the thing offered, and the service performed; but they have not in all Ages sped alike: They whose Services and Wor∣ship was performed to God, with a Relation to the Mediator, they have found Accep∣tance; and they whose Worship and Ser∣vice, was performed only, with a Relation to the thing offered or done; that was but their own Act, that was but their Will-Worship, and that was always turned back again upon
them: For there is no Name given under Heaven, by which any can be saved, but only the Name of Jesus Christ, that is, the Mediator of the New Covenant, for the Old one was broken; And when Aaron was set up to be an High Priest to God, he was ap∣pointed to offer Sacrifices for the Sins of the People; and they that committed a Sin, was appointed by the Law to bring an Hee-Goat of the Flock, unto the Door of the Tabernacle, and to deliver it to the Priest, and he was to make an Offering for the Sin committed, after such and such a manner, and it was to be an Attonement with God for them: So here was seemingly a Recon∣ciliation by a Sacrifice: And some saw no farther than the bringing of a Goat, and a Ram, and the performance of the Priests Office, and they counted all was well: And others saw farther, long before the Apostle spake or wrote it: It was not the Blood of Bulls, or Goats; nor the Blood of a Ram that could purge away Sin from their Consciences. And after the Apostle had opened the Mystery of Divinity, who had a Divine, and Spiritual Skill, in unfold∣ing the Restoration of Mankind; he de∣clared plainly that when the Offering was made by Aaron for Sinners, even then there
remained still a Conscience of Sin; for it was not possible that the Blood of Bulls and Goats should take away Sin; so that their outward performances, and their outward services, they did but point out the Media∣tor; they had a pointing finger as it were to the Real, True, and Everlasting Mediator Christ Jesus, who is made a Mediator be∣twixt God and Man; that by, and through him, man might be again Reconciled to God. So that now in these Gospel days, where∣in God is opening the Mysteries of Life, and Salvation, to the intent and purpose, that the Sons and Daughters of Men might be restored again, unto their Primitive En∣joyment of the Favour of God: Now in these days, it is the Duty of all Christians, and of all that are seeking the welfare of their Immortal Souls, that they have their Eyes and their Hearts unto Jesus, as unto one that is able to Reconcile them unto God; To him it is committed; to him Wisdom, and Power is committed, and to him Authority is committed, that he should be an Everlasting High Priest, and that all the Services, and all the Worship, and Re∣ligious performances that People offer up to God, should be in his Name; that so by
him they might be Recommended to God: For none will ever find Acceptance with the Father, unless in all their performances they have an Eye unto him. So that it comes plainly to pass, according to that short, and confident Assertion of the Author to the Hebrews, That without Faith it is impossible to please God: But it is possible to Offer Sacrifices without Faith; and possible for People to perform Religious Services without Faith, as woful Experience have taught us in our days; That many have been exercised in a kind of a Religious Ser∣vice, and Worship, that never in their Lives had Faith enough to believe the things that they pray for: And they are without Faith. For when People Pray to God to send his Holy Spirit into their Hearts, that they may keep his Commandments to their Lives End; they have not Faith to believe it: And when they Pray, Thy will be done, on Earth; as it is in Heaven: This is a Religious perfor∣mance, but I question whether it be done in Faith, [if not] it is but an Increasing in Sin, an Addition to Sin: Where is the Man that is exercised in praying to God, that believeth that ever such a thing is like to come to pass? Go where you will in this or the other Nation, and Inquire of People
about their Faith; they believe there is no possibility of Extirpating, and Rooting out of Sin, while they live upon the Earth; therefore all their Prayers for it are vain, and their Faith a vain Faith; and it is high time, in such a day as this when men are Faithless, and Unbelieving, to preach up the object of Faith, the Lord Jesus Christ: People are of divers Faiths; and of divers Beliefs; but we have found by experience, that they do them no good; they do not bring a thing to pass, that of necessity must be brought to pass ere they can be Recon∣ciled to God; their Faith doth not cleanse the Heart, nor extend so far as to believe that ere they shall be cleansed: In all the Wor∣ship and Religion that they perform, they come not to this Faith that they shall be made clean: All that is done is but in sin, and uncleanness, they cannot bring a clean Sacrifice out of an unclean Vessel; And our Lord Jesus Christ saith concerning this Sub∣ject; An Evil Tree cannot bring forth Good Fruit. But there must be good Fruit brought forth, how must we do it? Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good. When that Mens vain janglings about Re∣ligion, and Religious fancies must come to an end: Then all that Religion will appear
to be in vain, and will not answer the end for which it is performed, till men believe that it will make the Tree good and cleanse the Heart, and Transform men by Renewing the Spirit of their Minds. So that Religion it must begin within: And it is not our changing our forms of Worship, from one form to another, and taking up this, and the other Opinion, that doth change our hearts: Sad Experience doth teach us, that men may carry over their old Lusts into a new Reli∣gion; we can carry over our old Inclinations into our new Opinions: For though the form of Worship be changed, the Heart remaining unchanged, and the Lusts un∣mortified, their Religion is in vain, let them be of what persuasion they will. Now the remedy of this great Calamity, that hath overspread all sorts of People; for there is no sort of People, but there are those among them that are under this great Cala∣mity, of holding the profession of Godliness with an Ungodly mind, and the profession of Truth, with a false and treacherous Spirit. Now for the remedying of this there is but one way, that all Mens Eyes be brought off from having their Eye unto their Performances, and to the Doctrines and
Tenents that they hold, and do, as the Apo∣stle saith, Fix their Eye upon Christ, and look upon Jesus: that is the first thing that must begin our Religion; for Christ must be the Alpha of our Religion, as well as the Omega of it. If I begin not there, let me begin where I will, I begin wrong: Let me begin at the most serious and sound Doctrines and at the most Apostolical Religion: If Christ and his Apostles were here upon the Earth, if I walked among them, if I believ∣ed all they said, and did; I should begin wrong, if I did not fix mine Eye upon Jesus Christ, that is the taker away of sin, and is the sanctifier of the Soul by his Spirit. There must be the first beginning; and there must be the conclusion: he is the Au∣thor, and, the finisher of all true Faith: There are Authors of other Faiths, Men have different Faiths, and their Creeds, and Articles: And they have exposed and im∣posed them too; but this is the worst of it; none of them are right, let them be exposed, and imposed with never so much force and violence, none of these will cleanse the heart; but that Faith which is de∣livered over by Christ Jsus, that hath the quality of cleansing and purifying; that is the Faith when all is done that will do the
work, that is it that will save and sanctifie, and do the business that all the World is a∣bout; every one would have a Reconciler with God, and Sin rooted out, and be as God would have them be; this is the pub∣lick profession of Christendom, at least they would find out something by which it might be done. Others are willing enough to continue in Sin and Drunkeness Whoredom, Lying and Hypocrisie; these are a sort of Fools, that make a mock of Sin, and that swim in the stream of pleasure, and what care they so long as they make a profession of Christiani∣ty? But I am speaking of a People that are strugling under their corruptions, that would mortifie Sin, and serve God in Holiness and Righteousness; and do Gods will on Earth as it is done in Heaven; and do it not in form, but would have power to do it: And they try several ways to have it done, & it is not done; & many have been at this work till Gray Hairs are upon their Heads, and it is not done; Now God hath given Christ to make Recon∣ciliation; now how can we, that have the Love of God extended to us, But extend our Good-will to our Friends, and signifie to them, that all the travel and pains they are at, and all the Prayers they make, that
all will do nothing till they have their Faith fixt upon Jesus, that is able to save and de∣liver them, and save to the uttermost all that come to God by him. But here some will object and say, It is true what you say; But is it needful to preach such Doctrines to us, for we all believe in Christ, that is the only Mediator and Saviour; We know that Christ Jesus is the only Mediator, and that unless he Commend us to God, we cannot be Accepted of him? This is our General Doctrine, therefore what need it be urged and pressed upon us, that are come into the the Faith already? Let me search into the matter, it is of greater concernment than to search into a Bargain of Worldly things; men would fain have others open and discover to them where∣in they may be Cheated, to prevent their being Imposed on in a wordly bargain; I hope then they will hearken to know how, and wherein they may be deceived by them∣selves, and deceived by others in matters of Eternal concernment: There are no Pro∣testants, but they reject any Mediator but Jesus Christ, and believe that no Mediator can Reconcile them to God, but Christ alone, and they say he is the Object of their Faith: I would ask them this Question;
Whether they believe in Christ at a distance, or as present, really present with them? If their Faith be Historical and at a Distance, that they believe in Christ, as one born of the Virgin Mary, and was Crucified and Dead before they were born, and Arose again, and Ascended into Heaven, and is set at the right hand of God; if the reason of my belief be, I have heard of this Rela∣tion of Christ; Or whether the reason be, because by his Spirit, he hath visited me in this Age: The one is, I believe because good men have told me so; but the other is, I be∣lieve because by this Spirit he hath promised to send to lead me into all truth, he hath visited me; Now whether I am aware of such a Spiritual visitation, by this quickning Spirit, which is the Lord from Heaven, and not only the Lord in Heaven: Whether I am aware of such a quickning Power and Vertue, which I have received upon my Spi∣rit, that he is not only at the right hand of God on high in Heaven; but that now he is come to knock at the door of my heart, and hath raised in me a Life, as opposite to sin as his was. Now if I be aware of a secret touch of his quickning vertue upon my Soul, whereby he hath begotten me into a Life opposite to
sin, so that if sin remains, it remains as a Bur∣then, and Oppression upon me, so that I am a sufferer, forasmuch as I am quickned, and made sensible of a better life, of a god∣ly Life; I would fain be at it, and live in it; but Iniquity, Lust, and Corruption, lies in the way: He that hath quickned me so far, as to bring me to a sense of the Burthen of sin, my Faith tells me, he will take the Burthen off, else my faith will do me no good, if that Corruption still prevail upon me; if my Faith tells me this, it will tell the wickedest Man in the World as much: But if my faith tells me I am a sinner and my sin consists of this, and the other evil thing I do, and am inclined to do; it tells me again that he that hath quickned me, and brought me to a sense of sin, he can take the burthen off from me. Here now is a true Faith, that begins in Conviction, and ends in true Conversion, this is the word of Faith, which was deliver∣ed to the Saints, and which we are to Preach: They said of Od that the word of Faith, which they had to Preach, was that which was nigh in their mouth, that they might hea it and do it; I have something nigh, that reproves me for sin, if I be Obe∣dient to it, then Faith giveth me victory over
that which is sinful, for which the word re∣proveth me; and as I see Faith gives me victory over any Corruption, which I have been strugling under. Here I am incourag∣ed to fix my Faith upon him that hath thus quickned me; So that this is the difference between Faith in Christ at a distance, and Faith that quickneth me by Gods Spirit, that Spirit which hath been so much slighted in our days, by the highest Notionists in our Age; they have supposed it to be a meer fiction, some have mocked and derided, and others have been discouraged to speak of the Spirit of Christ, and his operations upon the Soul; some have declared it, both in the Press and Pulpit, that they have had no experience of the touches of Gods Spirit upon their Souls. But our experience hath brought us to ano∣ther degree of knowledge: We know, and you may know if you please, and that be∣fore you sleep that there is a way opened: God hath made a way for his Spirit to reach the Spirits of men, to signifie immediately to their Spirits without means; herein thou dost wrong, and herein thou mayest have life, and seek after it; Now the Spiritth at thus worketh, is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit that proceeds from the Father and the Son, that Voice in Man that tells them they
might believe and be saved: When he comes, saith Christ, He will lead you into all truth: How shall the World know this is he? He shall convince them of sin. If there be any convincement that ariseth in Man of this and the other sin, it must be from the way the holy Spirit hath upon their Spirits; he hath a way to speak to men; and every one that is a Lover of their own Souls, are bound to hearken unto that voice. In the latter days, saith the Lord, When I shall raise a Prophet in the midst of you, whosoever will not hear that Prophet shall be cut off: All Commentators agree on this Text, that that Prophet was no other than Christ Jesus, it was not John Baptist, nor Paul, nor Peter, but Christ that was pro∣mised to be raised; there was such an abso∣lute Command went along with that Pro∣phecy, That all should hear him, and it had a threatning at the end of it, That all that will not hear him shall be cut off: Are there not Whoremongers, and Drunkards, and Lyars, that will not hear this Prophet? They will not hear him, because they love their Sins, what becomes of them? They are cut off from the enjoyment of the Love and Favour of God: And when they did draw nigh to God in Prayer, and other Religious
exercises, it was with them, as it was with Cain, Sin lies at the Door. When they come into a storm at Sea, or are Arrested with sickness; and Death looks them in the face, they would have Peace, but there is Distress, and Trouble in the Room of it; what is the matter, wast thou not baptized into the Christian Faith? Did not the Minister tell thee, That thou art a Child of God and an Inheriter of the Kingdom of Heaven? Alas! my Sin lies at my Door; Oh that I had time to live a better Life! What ails thy life Man? My Life hath been a Life of Deceit, Lust, and Vanity; Corruption, and Hy∣crisie. Did not thy Teacher teach thee, that a believer hath no guilt upon him; but that all his Sins are pardoned, from the day he became a believer? This Doctrine will not hold in a storm, though it will do in fair Weather; when men are swimming in their pleasures, it will serve them; but when they come to deal with their Maker, no Faith will serve them but that which purifies the heart, and that which makes a change from the Earthly Image to the Heavenly. It were better for you and I, and every one of us; to take these things into consideration, while we have health and
strength, and while some Sand, (as I may so speak) is in our Glasses, to consider, what is my Faith? What is the Object of it? Have I a dependency upon my Duties, and Alms, and good Deeds? They will fail me. But if my dependency is upon Christ, as a Saviour and a Sanctifyer; and my Sanctifi∣cation is carryed on gradually: He that hath begun a good work in me, will perfect it: And if the reason of my going to Meetings, and going into my Closet, and bowing my self before the Lord, is to keep close to him that carries on the Work of Sanctification; he will work all my work in me and for me; I cannot expect to live in this World, but I shall meet with Temptations; the Devil will Tempt me; but my Saviour will be nigh me, as nigh to me as the Devil can be; If I Keep close to him he will keep close to me: My Father, saith Christ, is greater than I, and none is able to pluck you out of your Fathers hands. I must expect to be tempted, For the Adversary the Devil goes about like a Roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may devour. Alas! saith one, though I have made some progress in the work of Sanctifi∣cation, yet for all that, he may one day be∣tray me; Am I grown strong enough to re∣sist his Temptations? And wise enough to
foresee all his Gns and Traps, which he lays to insnare me? But I know who can see them, and defeat them; I have my Faith fixed upon one that can bind the strong Man, and cast him out; The Life that I now live, is not in my own Parts, and by my own Understanding and Sence: But the Life that I now live, in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God: This is that Faith that gives me victory; the Apo∣stle had a battle for it: I have fought the good fight; and henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, and not for me on∣ly, but for all them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; And that come to have familiarity with Christ, with his Spi∣rit and Truth in their Hearts, with his Grace, and Word; though these are seve∣ral Expressions, they all signifie one Immor∣tal seed of Life, by which men are United to God. It is a Leaven there, to Leaven them into the Divine Nature. Whenever such a one his Tempted, he resists not the Tempter in his own power; but he waits to feel the arisings of that Life and Power, and Vertue, that was in Christ Jesus, and is in him still; he waits for that power that in the name of Christ he may say, Get thee behind me Satan: Being for∣tifyed
by Christs Name, and armed with his power; What is it that a Christian can∣not do? What Valiant, Noble, and Won∣derful things have they done, that have been shielded with this Faith? See the Ele∣venth Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews: All the Repetitions of that Chapter from one end to the other, in all of them the Apostle he ascribes all the Valiantness, and Coura∣giousness of those noble Acts, to the power of Faith; they looked to Jesus, before ever the Virgin Mary brought him forth of her body. The Prophets did earnestly seek to know those things, which the Spirit of Christ that was in them did signifie; That there was to be a Prophet, before ever the Virgin Mary was born: So that Christ was always the Object of a true Believers faith; tho' under the Law they had an high Priest, and he was placed at the Altar, and they had Offerings burnt upon it; Yet they had an Eye unto Christ; They had an under∣valuing of all that their Sacrifices could do for them: If thou wouldst have had burnt Offerings, saith David, I would have given them, I would not have with-held them from thine Altar; thou shouldest have had enough of them. He was bold to say, in respect of Acceptance and Reconciliation; Burnt Of∣ferings
and Sacrifices thou wouldst not, a Bo∣dy hast thou prepared me; for it is written in the Volume of the Book, I come to do thy Will O God: He had an Eye unto Jesus that was to come, upon whom help was laid; there was a Redeemer, that should come from Sion, and a Lawgiver from Jerusalem; they had an Eye beyond Sacrifices, unto Christ: In all Ages, the People of God, they have had the Answer of their Souls, which is Reconciliation, and the Favour of God; they that had this Answer never had it but by Christ: No Man can be accepted with God, can never have the desire of his Soul Answered in Peace, and Reconciliation with God, till his Faith be placed on Christ Jesus: Neither can any man have Faith in Christ at a distance, and thereby be Recon∣ciled unto God, but must know his Spirit; I must have an experimental knowledge of his Power, and Wisdom, and this I cannot have without his Spirit; Let me believe ne∣ver so Orthodoxly, except I have the Spirit of Christ, it will do me no good, it will be of no Advantage to me. This is the Word, that was in my heart as a well wisher to the Souls of all Men: As God hath done good to my Soul, So I cannot but wish well to the Souls of others:
That as he hath found out a way for my Redemption, and Salvation, so likewise I wish the same for others that are bond-men and bond-women, and under the Power of their Corruption: Gods work hath been to destroy the Bondage and the Oppression, and to destroy the Tyrant that Reigns over the Souls of his People, God having made them for his Glory; and the Devil hath Stolen them away, that they do not that which pleaseth God: But God's good pleasure is, that all may be Saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth: And God so loved the World, that he gave his only begot∣ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not Perish but have Everlasting Life: And he is called The Lamb of God, which takes away the Sins of the World. He can take away Sin, if my Sin do not obstruct my Faith, and Confidence in him, he will take it away; and if he takes that away, then he makes the Tree good. Nothing hinders us from the injoyment of God, but Sin; and if Christ will take it away by the blood of his Cross, no matter for all the Scorn, Con∣tempt, Hardship, Reproach and Persecuti∣on of this World; no matter, for he hath not deceived us, but told us before hand; If we will be followers of him, and be led by
him, we must expect these things, suffering Reproaches, Persecutions, Disdain, Envy, these things come not uncertainly upon us; the World loves its own, and cannot love them that are not of it; but they that are now of the World may be brought to the terms of God, and they may not be any longer of the World: Christ Prayeth not that his Disciples may be taken out of the World, but kept from the evil; he prayed for them that did not believe: So that Christ is a Mediator for all men, and a Propitiation for all men, and he is working by his Spirit for the Redemption of all men, That to as many as believe in him, to them he gives Power to become the Sons of God. The sum of all is this, that we have an opportunity put into our hands, we cannot deny it, you must all upon search confess, that the Grace of God doth often work in your hearts, against any Corruption, against any Evil: Let not this prize be put into our hands in vain, as into the hands of fools: If I knew that this, and that, was a sin, I would leave it; let us be of that mind, and we shall soon know it: Then say, If I knew such a thing to be a sin, If I could get a thousand pounds by it, I would not do it; why should'st thou love sin for profit or plea∣sure?
I am sure it is an ill bargain when it is done: Whatsoever I am convinced of is a sin, I will not it. Resolve upon this, and there the Grace of God will be at work; we shall soon see that we must leave off sinning there is such a thing I must leave, God hath set up a Judgment in my mind against it, though it bring profit and pleasure, away it must go; here is a step, a following step, to follow Christ, he that will deny himself will follow Christ: My Redeemer shews me this to be an evil; I will not do it, but follow him, and imitate him: Here the Soul is led step by step, even by Christ the Captain of our Salvation, till it is gradually cleansed from sin, and reconciled unto God; and this can be done by no other means, for Prayer and Alms will not do it: All that can be done by us will not dot it; none can do it but Christ alone, that God hath laid help upon, that you may all wait for the Divine Opera∣tion of his Grace in your hearts; that is it which we Labour and Travel for, as know∣ing, that God hath wrought wonderfully by it for the Redemption of all those that love him, more than they love their plea∣sures, more than they love their sins; it must be concluded that following of him, and
leaving Father and Mother, Husband and Wife, Children, Brethren and Sisters, all these things as they stand in competition with him, and the Obedience of his Spirit; all these must be looked upon as nothing to him: Then above all things I must not dis∣please him; He can speak Peace, and none can take it away; and if he take it away none can give it: If we follow Christ, when this is done, then all is done according to the Will of God; then the blessing of God de∣scends upon the whole Creation; then every man will speak truth to his Neighbour, and every man will govern his Family with dis∣cretion; So God is Glorified. and his name comes to be Exalted, who is worthy to be Lov∣ed, Adored and Exalted above all Blessings and Praises, to him be Glory, who is God over all, Blessed for Ever, and Ever. Amen. His Prayer after Sermon. MOST Glorious God of Life and Power, and of Everlasting Kindness; a God of Long-suffering and Patience, else we had not been here at this day: Lord we are Monuments of thy Mercy; thou hast spared us long and hast called unto us in a day, when we turned away our Ear from thee; thou hast
stretched out thy hand all the day long; and thou hast gathered a little Remnant of the lost Sheep of the house of Israel to partake of thy Pastures of Life; and now all our Souls have been greatly refreshed, and com∣forted, since we come to understand and com∣prehend with the rest of thy Saints, the Height, and Length, and Breadth, and Depth of thy Love, which in the Son of thy Love thou hast Revealed to us: And blessed Father of Life, our Souls do breath and cry unto thee, on the behalf of Strangers which are Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel; that are yet brea∣thing and inquiring after thee, And asking the way to Sion; O Lord remember them and hear their cry, and let their sighing and complaining enter into thine Ears; that all they, in whom thou hast begun to kindle up holy desires after thee, may have them grow into a flame to burn up all their Enmity to thee, that so they may be purified by thy judgments, and receive of thy Heavenly Grace. This is the way which thou hast used with thy Chil∣dren; thou hast commanded them to Wor∣ship thee in thy dwelling place; thou hast taken them into thy house, and fed them with thy finest Wheat, refreshed them with thy Loving-kindness; and filled them with thy Holy Spirit: Dearest God of Love, this
is the design and purpose of our Meeting toge∣ther; that we may enjoy thy Presence, and feel the operation of thy Word, and have Communion with thee, and thy Son Jesus Christ, through thy Holy Spirit; the way into Rest and Life is with thee, thou canst open, and none can shut: Lord open the hearts of this People, to receive of thy goodness, and receive of thy blessings, that so every one may be sensible that thu art at the least knocking at the door of their hearts, that thou mightest have an entrance, and bow the hearts and wills of all, to receive what thou givest and hast to offer; to receive the word of Life, by which thou art quickning them: And kindle holy desires after thy self, that every one may receive thy truth in the love of it: That so blessed God of Life, thy glorious work of Redemption may be carryed on, and we may all feel it carryed on upon our Souls: Hear thy poor People that are crying unto thee, the God of Gods in Zion, that are sensible of their weakness and feebleness, and how un∣able they are to overcome the Enemies of their Soul: Arise in thy power O Lord, and these Enemies shall be scattered; Let the Souls of thy People be raised from the Dust, and delivered fom their Sin, that they may rejoice and paise thy name for their deliverance. Righ∣teous
God of Life; our Eyes are unto thee, to set forth thy glory, for th u hast made bare thine Arm for the Salvation of the poor and needy Souls; and thou hast been stretching forth the cords of thy Love to gather them that were scattered: and hast been bringing home to thee those that were hurried away in a dark and cloudy day: Thou hast made us sensible of thy operations; and hast constrained thy Servants to labour in the Word and Doctrine, for the gathering of such home; that so they and we may enter into thy holy Covenant and may sound forth thy praises to the Ages and Generations to come: That so Holy God of Life, and Love, thou that hast saved us with a mar∣velous salvation mayest receive for all thy mer∣cies, and blessings to thy Children, Praises, Glory, Honour and Thanksgiving; for thou alone art worthy, who art God over all blessed for Ever. Amen.
Sermon II. Heart Preparation for Receiv∣ing the Gospel. Preached at Devonshire-House, Feb. 12. 1687. IT is in my heart at this time to desire that every ones heart were prepared to be made partakers of the blessings of the Gos∣pel; For there is a certain Preparation that every one must witness in themselves, ere they are capable of receiving Divine bles∣sings; For in all Ages of the World the Blessings of the Lord have been manifold, and his Arm hath been always stretched out in all Ages to the Sons and Daughters of Men sensible of the Love he hath unto them, and where these tenders of the Love of God have met with prepared hearts, they have received it to their Eternal well-fare: But this hath been the Lamentation that hath
been taken up upon the greatest part of mankind, that they have not been prepared to receive the Love of God, their hearts and minds have been so filled with the Love of visible things and carnal objects, that they have not been truly sensible of the Riches of Grace and Mercy, and Love of God unto them. Now it was said of old by the Prophet, That the Preparation of the Heart is of the Lord; and there is somthing that belongs to us on our part, that we might attain to this this Preparation, that we might be brought in to this Spiritual frame of mind, and that is, by returning to the Lord; that Peo∣ple might think upon his Name, and have regard to his Appearance: And although this is not the work of Nature, for by Na∣ture the minds of People are abroad, and they are crying out as the Psalmist speaks, Who will shew us any good? Yet to help that defect, the Lord hath been pleased to send forth his Grace and his Truth and to call unto the Sons and Daugh∣ters of Men that they might seek after him, that they might Seek the Lord while he is to be found; and they that do hearken unto his voice they will readily confess that there is nothing doth so well satisfie an Immortal Soul
as to be gathered into fellowship with its Maker: And that at one time or other it is the desire of all Men and Women that they might attain Peace with the Lord; and they know there is no Peace to the wicked, and they know wickedness will remain until it is abolished and destroyed; and they know that it is not in their Power to destroy it, and therefore of necessity there must be a waiting upon the Lord who is Al∣mighty, that he may reveal his Power in our weakness. And they that are thus Prepared in their Minds, for them to meet religiously toge∣ther, with expectation unto God that he ac∣cording to his promise will appear and will reveal his Arm, and do in them and for them that which they cannot do for themselves; this is a fit occasion for People to meet toge∣ther, and thus many times to have their ex∣pectation to God and say, Lord thou knowest my weakness, and thou knowest the enemies I have to deal withal; thou knowest I am not able to overcome them; Therefore we are now met together in the Presence of the Lord to wait to receive at his hands that Power, that Life, that Vertue by which we may be made more than Conquerours. Such a Religious Meeting thus gathered together
hath a Promise, I will be in the midst of them, saith the Lord; and therefore having a pro∣mise we may reasonably expect that we shall be made partakers of the living Virtue and Power, by which we may do that, which of our selves we cannot do. And I say, Friends, it is my Souls desire that you were all thus qualified, that every one had an evidence in himself of this right Preparedness; for where the Eye is abroad upon any visible thing, that it seeks satis∣faction in any thing below the Lord himself, it will wear away and wax old: All those Objects that People fix their minds upon, they will wax old; but they whose desires and the breathings of their Souls is that they may grow into Acquaintance with their Maker; this will never wax old. When Peoples minds are fixed as the People of the Lord of old were: When they made a com∣parison between the state of their minds and the minds of others, and signified it in these words; They are saying: They are crying, (that is, they that are of the World) Who will shew us any good? But we for our parts, our cry is, Lord lift up the light of thy Coun∣tenance upon us, and we will be more glad of that than thy can be with all the increase of Corn and Wine, and Oil.
Now they that feel in themselves the rea∣son of their Meeting together is to enjoy the Light of Gods Countenance and to par∣take of the blessings of God; they have their expectation to God, their minds are retired into God: But knowing right well that if the Tongues of Men and Angels are moved to declare the Heavenly and Divine Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, they cannot be Edified or benefited by them without the Divine help and assistance of God's Spirit, for there is a Seal upon them, and none can open that Seal, but The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, he only is found worthy to unseal the Mystery, and unseal the Divine Blessings that are with the Lord, so that People must come to that retiredness of Spirit, to that resignation of Soul that they are as a little Child waiting upon the Lord, crying out unto the Lord that he will Prepare them: That he will make rhem Hungry, and then Feed them, That he will raise a Thirst in them, and then satisfie them with those Divine Springs of Life, which through the Lord Iesus Christ are opened to every one that Believeth. So far as your minds are stayed and setled waiting for the Lord, you will feel in your selves an openness and
readiness, that if the Lord speaks you are ready to hear him; ready to submit to his word; ready to obey him; that so there may be such an openness in the mind, not to the words of any man, but unto the word of God, to receive that; for where the words of men are received though never so excellent, they convert not the Soul, But the Word of the Lord is pure converting the Soul. And this word is that which is able to Quicken those that are Dead in Sins and Trespasses, and bring them to be made partakers of Life. For it is not an encrease of knowledge that will do the turn, but it is the increase of Life and Vertue, the increase of God∣liness, and a Submitting of our Wills unto him that made us: It is this that will do our turn, this will bring Peace to the Soul, and bring us into the Favour of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Now that all may feel that which Prepares the Heart, for this resignation, and quietness, and sub∣jection, you must wait upon the Lord that ye may be made partakers of the blessings of of his Everlasting Gospel, and of his Divine Presence: This is that which is most profit∣able, most advantagious: And then the Lord will Open to you the Windows of Hea∣ven,
and Rain down of those Blessings upon you, whereby you will be comforted and refresh∣ed, far beyond all the Works that we can do, for it is an inward Work that must be done upon the Soul to Convert People that have been Alienated and estranged from God, and bring them to a Reconciled State through the Lord Jesus-Christ, whereby they may partake of the Divine virtue, which Sanctifies and justifies the Soul in the sight of God. His Prayer after Sermon, Most Glorious and Powerful Father, thy Arm of Power is made bare in this our Day to bring Salvation to the Poor; O Lord thou hast lifted up the Light of thy Countenance upon a People, that have waited for thy Glory and thy Salvation, a little Rem∣nant whom the good of this World could not sa∣tisfie, but O Lord in an acceptable time thou hast brought thy Salvation near, and the Light and Brightness of thy everlasting Gos∣pel thou hast commanded to shine into the Hearts, and Souls of the Mourners, and bow∣ed down ones, who are seeking the living God, not among the outward Forms and ways of Men. But, O Blessed Father of Life, thou
hast now brought us to the Day of thy Power, and bowed our Wills, and made us a willing People therein to serve thee, and to do thy Will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven; and for that end O Lord thou hast put it into the Heart of thy People to wait upon thee in whom all our fresh Springs are, that from thee we might receive the renewing of Power from Day to Day, and in all the hours of our Temp∣tations and Tryals, our Eyes O Lord have been to thee, and to thy Power; and we acknow∣ledge to the Glory of thy Power and Goodness, that thou hast been a God nigh at hand, when we have been seeking thee, and trusting in thee, so that we are a People sensible of thy Power and presence with us; for that Eye which thou keepest open to thy Children, It brings thy Glory to our view, and shews it breaking forth over the Nations, and we have great joy and satisfaction in beholding the Progress of thy Mighty Power in our Day, how thou hast broken down and Confounded, and art still breaking down and Confounding all the Dark imaginations and Devices of the Sons and Daughters of Men, that have Con∣spired to hinder the breaking forth of the Glory of thy Son Christ Jesus. O Powerful God of Life arise more and more in the greatness of thy Power and Love, and make known thy
Counsel, and thy will among the inhabitants of the Earth, and bow their minds O Lord and their Wills, that none may dare to with∣stand thy appearance, lest they be found fight∣ers against God and destroyers of themselves. O Powerfull Father, for this end make bare thine Arm unto the Rulers and Governours of these Nations, that they may know thy Coun∣sels, and bow to thy Heavenly Will, and may promote thy Law of Righteousness in their own Hearts, and the Hearts of others, that by thy Power a Blessed Reformation may be wrought, and iniquity have a stop put to it, that it may not run down in a mighty Stream, as it hath done in time past, but that Truth and Righteousness, and sound Judgment may be known in the Earth; that they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness may have their Souls desires satisfied, and so praise and thanks∣givings shall arise from their Souls to thee. O Powerful Father of Life preserve and keep thy Children whom thou hast gathered, and Purged, and Purified, and to whom thou hast made known the way of Life; and made them a willing People in the Day of thy Power, to do thy will and to wait for the coming of that kingdom that thou hast promised to establish under Christ Jesus, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, that it may grow and increase
and be spread abroad upon the Earth, and let every one desire to be the Subject thereof; So Powerful Father of Life, the Arm of thy Power and Invincible strength hath been Re∣vealed that nothing hath been able to resist or stand against and prevail, by which thou art planting Sion and building Jerusalem, and e∣stablishing it; By the same Power let thy Work be carryed on and many be brought in to be Sub∣jct to Christ for the good of their Immortal Souls; as thou hast multiplied thy Blessings among us, so from Day to Day thou hast made us sensible of thy Love unto us, owning us to be thy Children, and peculiar People, by thy presence in the midst of us when ever we meet in thy Name to wait upon thee that so living Father, all thine both here and every where may be encou a∣ged to attend upon thee, and to be faithful to thy Power; that wait for the opning of thy Counsels and the enlightning their understand∣ings that they may be able to compehend with all Saints, the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of thy Love in Christ Jesus, that in the Sense of the freeness and greatness there∣of, all thy Children here and every where, that in an everlasting Covenant of Grace thou hast gathered to thy self, may have Com∣munion with thee and thy Son, and Spirit, and may return thee the honour Glory and
Praise of all thy Love and Mercy, and Grace, for thou alone art worthy, who art God over all, Blessed for ever and ever. Amen. Sermon III. The First and Great Com∣mandment opened, Or The Heart given up to God. Preached at Devonshire-House, May 27. 1688. VVHen God gave forth his Law on Mount Sinai, which Israel was to hear and to obey; The first great Com∣mandment was, Thou shalt have no other Gods before me, here is the sum and substance of all the true Religion that ever was on the Earth to this day, all the Commandments,
all the Precepts, Prophecies, and all the dealings of God with his People from that Day to this, have been all contained in this short Precept, thou shalt have no other Gods but me, and as long as Israel stood in Obe∣dience to this Command, their Blessings were multiplied upon them, their good things were increased from Day to Day; The Lord was with them as long as they were willing to be his Pple; he appeared as their God, as their Defeder wrought their Deliveran∣ces, sought all their Battles for them, gave them Dominion and Strength, Courage and Wisdom; Ministred out of his Treasury all good things unto them; For the great Care of God Almighty was with all his People, he had regard to them, and visited them at all times to keep them from Idolatry, I am, saith he, a Jealous God, take notice of me to be so; I am Jealous of my Name. If thou wilt be mine, thou shalt have no other Gods bu me. And all the Precepts about Offerings, and Sacrifices, and making attonement for Sinners, and the divers Services and Wor∣ship, the various Offices in the Temple and Sanctuary, they were all as outward means appointed of God to keep this outward Church in an inward Conformity to the
Command of God. This Command was written in Tables of Stone, and these Tables were laid up in the Ark of God, and all this pertained to the First Covenant, and all this Typed and Figured out the Dispensation of the New and everlasting Covenant that God would make with his People, not like unto the old; How not like it? Not like it in the outward Shadows, the Types and Sha∣dows of things, but he would bring forth the Susbtance of all those Shadows and Types; and would alter the Form and out∣ward appearance of things, For as God is unchangeable so his Law is unchangea∣ble. Moses saith the first and great Command∣ment is, thou shalt have no other Gods but me. This was put into the Stone Tables. Christ Jesus saith, the first and great Command∣ment is, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, Mat. 22, 27. This is put into the Tables of the Heart; So here is a difference between the first Commandment by Moses, and the first Commandment by Christ, they both ac∣knowledge the first and great Command to be the subjecting of the Creature to him that made him as his God, that he may only serve him, that he may love him with his whole
Heart; The Jew could prove this by his Stone Tables, and Christ proves this by the Fleshly Tables of the Heart, for there he is bound to love the Lord with his whole Heart, and to serve him onely, him onely shalt thou serve. Now here is the Jews Law brought over to the Christians in the greatest Point of Religion that ever was Preached, that shuts out all Idolatry, all Superstition, all variety of Religions, all is shut out by this Com∣mandment, and the Christian that hath the Law written in his Heart according to the new Covenant, he can go as readily to it and read it, as ever the Jew could go to his Stone Tables, and read the Law there; you can∣not deny that, if there be a thing written and Graven in my Heart, I can go as readily to it as I can go to any Book or Table, though I have the keeping of it; But the Jews had not the keeping of it (generally,) it was laid up in the Ark of God. Now Friends that which lies upon my mind to speak to you at this time, and that out of the great Love that I have to all your precious and Immortal Souls, as God hath had a Love to mine, is that you would all consider and weigh in the fear of the Lord whose presence is among us, which of you,
and how many of you are come to the Obe∣dience of this Commandment I? do not doubt but the most of you can say, them all, but a happy People are you if you can do one, I dare pronounce that Soul a blessed Soul, that can perform this one Commandment, that can or dare stand before his Maker and say, O Lord I love thee with all my Heart, with all my Soul, and with all my Might, my love is withdrawn from all other things in compa∣rison of thee, there is nothing in this whole World hath a place in my mind, but as it is in subjection to the love of thee. Here is the first and the great Command∣ment, the unchangeable Law, the Law that was good in Moses his Days, and good in Christs Days, and it holds good in our Days; and indeed it is such a definitive Law that the Breakers of it can neither be good Jews, nor good Christians; there is an absolute ne∣cessity lies upon us of abstracting and draw∣ing away our minds and Souls from all other Gods, from all Images and other dependen∣cies and trusts that People are naturally liable to trust to; And to have their whole Confi∣dence set upon the Lord, but alas! with Grief of Heart I speak it, there are but a very few that as yet have known the right giving forth of the Law, and there are a
great many fewer that are subjct to it. This Law was not given forth at first with∣out Thunder and Lightning and a terrible noise, and the Mountain smoaking, (he that hath an Ear to hear let him hear) in so much as Moses himself said, he feared greatly and he Quaked exceedingly because of the Thunder of the Almighty, and the Mountain that smoaked and burned with Fire so that Israel could not draw nigh. Now I say there are but a few that have come to the Knowledge of the giving forth of this Law, that have certainly known those Thunders, and that Terrible Work that the Lord of the whole Earth makes, when he comes to set up his Law; for a great many that have come nigh to it, and might have heard and received the Words of the Law of God, they have gone backward, they have done like unto the Jews of old, though they had suffered much, and gone through much, and had seen the Wonders of the Lord, how be had led them and delivered them, yet when it came to this, that they must hear the Voice of God, they said we cannot bear it; We cannot indure it: We have devised for our selves an easier way, for the Voice of Thunder and Dreadful noi∣ses put them into Terrour and Quaking, and
Trembling and great Dread came upon them but we have found an easier way say they, what is that? Go thou, said they to Moses, and hear thou what the Lord saith, and come thou and tell us. Thou shalt be a Mediator be∣tween us, let God speak unto thee, and do thou speak the same to us, and we will hear thee. This was the Jews that were not come be∣yond the Law of God written in Tables of Stone, they would not come to receive it in their Hearts as the Christian must; so Moses he re∣ceived the Law from the Mouth of God, and he was Faithful as a Servant in the House of God, and he ministred forth the Law of God, his Precepts, Statutes and Judgments, and Testimonies, and he made them a Book of Laws for all of them to walk by, from the highest to the lowest, how they should act in Criminal matters, and do justice between Man and Man, and what they should do in the Worship of God, and what they should do towards the Priest whose Lips should preserve knowledge for them, and so he brought up a Form of Religion, but his Work was according to the Precepts of God, and he brought them into the Form of Na∣tional Religion, and Government, and Na∣tional Laws. And so Moyses, and the Priests
ruled over them, and the Priest he offered Sacrifice for them, and made attonement for them, and Moses inquired of the Lord, and asked Counsel for them, and taught, and instructed them, and what cme of all ths at last? When this was done, the Priest made attonement for Sin; but he could not pluck away the guilt of one Sin, there re∣mained the Conscience of Sin after he had made his Offering, and Moses taught them the Counsels of God, and the Commands of God, but he could not bind their Hearts to the obedience of them, for he declared o∣penly against them, that they were a Re∣bellious and stiffnecked People; notwith∣standing this they had a Law without them; indeed time would fail me to run through the manifold miscarriages of the Church of the Jews in respect of their Idolatry, in re∣spect of their Contempt and Rebellion, both to God and his servant Moses, which was to teach and to guide them: I say the time would fail me to mention the manifold mis∣carriages that happened among this People, that had a Law and Religion without them, and a Teacher without them. Now in the fulness of time it pleased God in sending his Son Christ Jesus to raise up a Prophet like unto Moses in respect of
Faithfulness, though higher in respect of Dignity; for Moses was faithful in all his House as a Servant; but this Man was faithful as a Son in his own House, in the House that he was Heir of, that House wherein he was a King; both a Priest, a Prophet and a Ruler in: When the Lord signified by the Spirit of Prophecy the com∣ing of the Just one; he signified to the People that his Ministry, it should not be as that of Aaron; the People should not have their Religion without them, and their Laws and Precepts without them, and their Priests without them, and their Wor∣ship and Church without them; but that they should have it all within them; I will write my Law in their Hearts, I will put it into their Inward Parts: then they shall be my People, and I will be their God; and they shall not forsake me. Your Fathers brake my old Covenant, but I will make a new Covenant in the Latter days, a New Covenant, not like that your Fathersbroke; they brake the Law without them, But I will Write my Law in their Hearts: This Prophet that is like to Moses, he shall Teach my People, he shall be a Leader to them, and guide them in the way they are to go; and shall be a Captain for them to lead them to Salvation: And it shall come
to pass, in the Day that I do this, if there be any that will not hear him, he shall be cut off from among the People. That is the Judgment that comes upon the contemners of the Gospel, upon them that will not hear Christ Jesus; they shall be cut off from the People; from what People? From the Peo∣ple of God; they shall have no part of the Priviledges that are enjoyed through Christ; they shall be cut off from the Benefits that others reap by their Faith in Christ. So that now we are to expect the opera∣tion and working of a Ministry that leads a People to an inward Religion, a Heart Religion, where the Heart is fixed intirely upon the True and Living God, as the ob∣ject of their Dependance and Trust, and they have no other; that same is a strange Word to Flesh and Blood; what no other Dependance but on the Invisible God? Flesh and Blood can never come to this: Flesh and Blood and Sensuality can never come to this: This is a Religion that hath been hid from Ages and Generations, and will be hid to all Ages that ever shall be in the World where Sensuality prevails: What will you have me to have my whole De∣pendance for the Comfort of my Life here, and of the Life that is to come, the other
Life; to have my Dependance upon an In∣visible God, that Invisible Power that made me, and Created the World? How is it possible for me to sequester my self, and draw my self off from all visible Objects? I must trust to this, and trust to that; Flesh and Blood can never attain to this with all the Wit and Reason it hath, it can never separate it self from Idols; they are little Children that keep themselves frrom Idols: They are Children of another birth, born of another seed, that will keep themselves from Idols. Friends, Idolatry is a great deal more common, I find, than most are aware of. Am I commanded to Love the Lord with all my Heart, and Soul, and Mind, and Might? What is left when the whole is taken away? If God hath my whole Heart, what have I to bestow upon the World? What Love, what Affection, what Eager∣ness, what Fervency can I bestow upon the World, or any Object in the World; when my whole Heart, and Soul, and Mind is gone before, gone towards the Lord? This is the First and Great Command∣ment and the Second is like unto it; that is Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy self;
Here it is that the Law and the Prophets Faith, Creeds, Prayer, Religion and Wor∣ship, all that ever was in the World, all Comprehended in this: Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, Soul and Strength; and thy Neighbour as thy self: So what need is there for us to be disputing about Religion, about this Tenet and the other Tenet, this Text and the other Text? For my part I should only desire for you to Understand this Text, and I should not doubt your going to Heaven: Here is the Sum: Here is all at once: Here is the Quin∣tessence of all Religion, of all Types, Sha∣dows, Figures, Ceremonies, and Priesthood, and all that ever was or could be Named and Practised in the World, all brought to this, The Heart given up to God; our Love set upon him. What, is this sufficient, will some say? This will make you a good Moral Man, but what is this to the Christian Religion? You may be led into Error, and become an Heretick for all this. How can this be that I should not be of a sound Faith, but led into Error and Heresie for all this? When People let in Error, and Heresie, and Unsoundness of Faith, Where do they let it in? Do they not let in the
Principles of Errour and Heresie into their Hearts? I believe this, and that, and the other Error, it comes into the Heart, and hath a seat in the Heart; but how can we do that? How can we let it into the Heart; When the Heart is given up to God? Can∣not he keep out Error and Heresie, if I give up my Heart and Soul to him? Cannot I trust him with all? This kind of talk of Error and Heresie hath come among Men that have had the keeping of their own Souls; they have taken their own Souls into their own hands, and have ordered their Religion themselves, or have gotten some body to order it for them, and a great many of them have met together to make Creeds, and Catechisms, and Con∣fessions, and Orthodox Doctrines, that might certainly be professed and subscribed. Afterwards some have come and found fault with them; then they must have a Council to try them, then these go off and are laid aside, and others are given in the room of them; so that these Men have set up for themselves: These would not be under the Government and Prescription of God, as Children under the Government of a Father, but they will set up Religions themselves; and say to the rest of the World, if you
own any thing contrary to our Principles, you are an Heretick; and being an Heretick you are to be rooted out and cut off. Do not you read in the Scripture, that whosoever hears not the Prophet that was to come into the World shall be cut off? What will you not hear Christ speak in the Church? Will not you hear Christ speak? The Church cannot speak without a Head: If you will not hear the Church you shall be cut off. Then they have fallen to Hanging, and Burning, and Killing, and Destroying People, and Nations not a few: And this comes from their mak∣ing Faiths and Creeds, and ordering Religi∣on themselves; all their Barbarous and Inhu∣man Cruelties Martyring and Dungeoning of People comes from their making Faiths themselves, and of all things nothing is more desparately wicked, and they did not know it. The Heart is deceitful above all things and de∣sparately wicked, who can know it? Men know not how Proud and Arrogant they them∣selves are, and yet they would be ordering the Hearts and Minds and Consciences of others, and out of this hath Sprung all Su∣perstition and Idolatry because men would not give up their Hearts to God; Thou shalt have no other Gods but me. This Commandment is great in it self, strict in
the terms, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and thy Neighbour as thy self. Their Neighbour could not see with their Eyes; therefore there must be Hanging, and Burning, and Destroying one another. But blessed be who is now bringing forth true Christianity upon its old Basis and Foun∣dation whereon it was placed at first, for Christianity hath been justled off from its first Foundation: for instead of Loving God with all their Hearts, and Loving their Neighbours as themselves they Hated them: Now this is the Day, O Friends, the weight of it is great: This I say is the Day wheren God is bringing Christianity upon its old Foundation. I would not have you think that I am here judging our Fore-fathers that are fallen asleep, that therefore they are gone to Hell, because they saw not this Day, and Lived not to see the benefit of it that we enjoy; I am far from it: This was the thing that they believed and prayed to God for, they did not see this Day outwardly but they saw it by Faith. I my self when I was a Child I remember the People of God when they got three or four together they would rejoice in the Hope of what they
Foresaw; they gave Thanks to God for the Blessed Days that he would bring forth, though they could not tell when; they did say and believe that God would scatter the Foggs and Mists, and bring forth an Happy Day, wherein his People should have the Gift of his Spirit; when they saw the Impositions and Persecutions of these times, when they that did not Conform and Comply were cast into Prisons, and thrown into Dungeons, and Goals: Well, it will not always be thus, say they, there is a Day a coming wherein the Lord will set his People free from all the Yoaks of Oppression and from the Op∣pressour. Indeed my Soul did rejoyce when I was hearing the Prophetical sayings of these good men, and I thought I might live to see that Day; Blessed be God that hath Preserved my Life to this Day, and to this Hour to enjoy what they Prayed for: They Prayed to God to scatter the Mists and Fogs that they might no longer Cloud and Darken Men's Minds and hinder them from enjoying God's Teaching; Blessed be God that we are now in the injoyment of the Prayers of the Faithful, that left the World, before we were in it. Now the
Day is come that they Prayed for and En∣quired after. How strangely doth the Man Talk, will some say, concerning the Christian Reli∣gion? The Christian Religion is all Eng∣land over; go to any Meeting in London except one, and they will tell you they are Christians; I would to God they were, that is the worst I wish them all: But what should we talk of the Christian Religion with∣out the Christian Life? Except we find that amongst them, What signifies the Name and Profession of it? And the Chri∣stian Doctrine is wanting in many places too, There be many in this City urging this very Command of Loving God with all their Hearts, and their Neighbours as them∣selves, as fervently as I can do, or any body else; and yet they will tell you in the next breath, that no man in London nor in all the World can do this. No Man can pos∣sibly Love God with all his Heart: Never a Man can be found that can perform such an Act, as to Love his Neighbour as him∣self: Not every Neighbour it may be, but some one choice Associate he can pick out, that he can Love, and bear with his Infir∣mities and Affronts, and Love him as him∣self. Love thy Neighbour, that is, every
body; that there may be a Good-will for all People throughout the whole Race of of Mankind; Peace on Earth, Good-will towards Men: This is the Fruit of the Gospel, Christian Words will not make the Christian Religion, there must be a Christi∣an Life; But where shall we find that or seek for it? I know not, I have nothing to do to Judge any body, but there is one that Judg∣eth who it is that Liveth the Christian Life, and who doth not; Who is this? What a one is this? The Head of the Christian Church; Why, is he here? Yes, the Head of the Christian Church is here, and he speaks and gives Sentence; If you have an Ear you may hear him, and if you will turn your Mind inward, for he is an Inward Minister; every one of you if you will turn your Minds inward, he will tell you whether you Live a Christian Life, and what a Life it is you Live; If there be a Drunkard here, let him ask whether his Life be a Christian Life, will a man go away Ignorant from this place, and have no Answer? If there be a Drunkard here let him ask inwardly in his own Bosom. Lord is my Life a Christian Life? I dare affirm on Gods behalf he will have an Answer, No, thy Life is not a Chri∣stian
Life, but a Shameful Beastly Life, a Brutish one. Who told you that the Head of Christi∣ans Christ Jesus is present? Christ Jesus, is he present? how came he here? He is Ascended up into Heaven such a Day, say they; How came he here? Let him be Ascended up into Heaven; yet he is not so Ascended into Heaven as not to be here also; how should he fufil his Promise if he be Circumscribed in Heaven or Earth? How should he make good his Promise if when Two or Three are met together in his Name, he is not in the midst of them? Here are now many more than Two or Three met together in the Name of Christ, and that hope for Acceptance with God through the Mediator Christ Jesus; if you think that here are Two or Three met together in the Name of Christ, it follows that Christ is in the midst of them. I know not what you may enjoy, some may possibly say, I do not find any such Presence of Christ; I hear of the Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and I have heard talk of the Presence of Christ at a Meeting; but I have been at many a
Meeting and I never found such a Presence of Christ. Can you Read the Scripture? Yes, I can Read the Scripture as well as you, but that cannot give me a sense of it; I do Read the Scripture and Believe it, but what signifies my Reading the Scripture concerning the Presence of Christ, If I have not the sense of it? I have been at many a Meeting but never had the sense of such a Divine Presence as you talk of, nor it may be at the Sacrament neither. What is the reason thou hast no sense of it? If thou wilt take my Counsel and turn thy mind inward, and enquire whether the thing I speak of be true, whether there be such a Voice as I speak of? That will tell thee what thy State is, if thou wilt be true to thy self, thou mayest know the Divine Presence, and thou mayest hear Christ speak. The Soul hath got Eyes and Ears as well as the Body? What Eyes doth the Apostle mean when he saith, The God of this World hath blinded the Eyes of them that Believe not, lest the Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ who is the Image of God should shine unto them? If the Soul hath Eyes and Ears as well as the Body, it can Hear and See as the Body: As the Bodily Eye can See
Visible things, so the Eye of the Soul can See things that are Invisible and Heavenly; you can hear my Voice outwardly, and you may hear the Voice of Christ inwardly; I have known some that have been afraid to hear ill of themselves that they would not enquire; some have been so guilty in their own Consciences that they have been afraid of hearing ill, that they would not enquire about themselves: So it is inwardly, some have been Consciou that their Life and Conversation is nought, that their Life is a Sinful Life, that they dare not put it to the Question: It would cettainly have been told them, thy Life is not a Christian Life, thou must mend thy Life before ever thou comest to have Peace with God: If this should be thy Portion and mine, that upon search we should find our condition bad, what harm is it? I would put one Question to thee, be se∣rious in Considering of it: We are all Chil∣dren of Wrath by Nature, none of us differ about that; and that unless we be born again we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: The Question is whether I am one of those or no; Suppose upon enquiry it be discovered to me that I am not; it is bad enough: This is hard, but not so hard as it
is true, this is the thing which I would have you Consider; Am not I in a better case to know that I am in a Natural state, than to go on and perish to Eternity? As long as there is Life there is Hope; as long as a man is upon the Earth and taking care for his Soul, and enquiring about the State of his Immortal Soul: If my Soul is not in a good condition; Is it not better for one to know it, and to seek for a cure? For there is no greater Infirmity and Infelicity can be upon a Man than to have some oc∣cult and hidden Disease that he cannot be made sensible of; for this wasts and spoils him and he cannot be persuaded to look out for a Remedy; So it is inwardly, if a Man be Ignorant of his condition and go on to his Dying Day and Hour and not seek after a Remedy, this Man perisheth with∣out all peradventure. When you are in this enquiry be content to be controlled, be willing to have the Truth spoken though it be against your selves. I might instance in divers things that I have spoken of: If a man be satisfied that his Life is not a Christian Life, I say, if the Swearer or Lyar, if the Proud Person or the Effeminate, as soon as they come to be satisfied that their Life is not a Christi∣an
Life that they now Live, what will this man expect? What Counsel should we give him, and what Counsel should he take? I will go on in the way that I am in, what! after thou knowest thy Life is not a Chri∣stian Life? God forbid. Wilt thou go on and perpetrate Sin upon Sin, and heap up Wrath against the day of Wrath? I am a Sinner, my Life is Unchristian, I make ac∣count to Live in Sin and die in Sin, Is this good Policy? Consider another Text which our Lord spake; If ye die in your Sins, whether I go you cannot come. O Friends, lay these things to your Hearts, what have I to do but to tell you that the Love I have in my Soul to you all makes me desire in my Heart that you might be saved? This is the Will of God that you might all be saved and come to the knowledge of the Truth: Blessed are they which know the Truth, the Truth as it is in Jesus; Truth in the inward parts hath a speaking Voice, and if thou hearken to it, it will tell thee that thy state is nought: Canst thou believe the Truth when it tells thee so? That thy state is nought, and that thou art like to go to Eternal Destruction unless there be Repentance, and Regenera∣tion to prevent it. Canst thou believe this
Doctrine, when it sounds in thy own Heart? If thou canst not Believe it, Unbelief will be thy Ruine: The Spirit of Truth is come to convince the World of Sin, because they believe not in Christ; he tells them their Condition and they will not believe him: The Spirit of Christ convinceth men of Sin, and they believe him not; The Spi∣rit of Truth convinceth thee of thy Sin, but thou believest him not: Thou Lovest thy Pleasure, and thy Profit, and thine Hon∣our; then thou Lovest not God with all thine Heart, and then thou art not a Chri∣stian, but out of Covenant with God: Art thou sensible that thy condition is bad; were it not best to get it mended? After we are convinced of our own sinful state, Is it not our best course to seek to have it mended? Who shall mend it? Saith one, I have done all I can to mend my Life, and I cannot mend it. I have concluded so in my younger years I have Fasted, and Prayed, and spent time in Hearing, Reading and Meditation, and did all in my own Power, and all to mend my state, but I could not mend it; and as I grew up in years Sin and Corruption more prevailed, and there was no help; and I came so far as to believe there was no
help, and that if God did not help me I was undone to all Eternity. I many times wisht that I had never been born, I went to Mini∣sters and Meetings, and to all sorts of sepa∣rate People, and to all manner of Ordinance, and to all manner of Means to mend this bad Heart of mine; to see if I could get a Power that would give me Victory over my Corruption, but my Arm was never so long as to reach thereunto; it was far out of my Power and Reach. Many have sought to get this Power of Reforming their Hearts and Lives, to at∣tain it by their own hands, by their own endeavours, but they could never do it; they could never better their condition, nor bring forth fruit worthy of amendment of Life; I wish that every one was come to that pass, that they knew not which way to turn them, that they were come at last to their Wits end; they will come to it sooner or later, the sooner the better. I have done all I can, I can do no more, I am at my Wits end and know not what to think con∣cerning my Eternal State; I know not what to judge of it, I strive against my Lusts and Corruptions; but for all that they prevail upon me, Temptations come before me, but I cannot conquer them. O I am glad
when People are come to that pass that they know not what to do, but to despair of their own Arms, of their own Strength, and their own Wit, and despair of all other help in the World; I am glad of that. But I am not Preaching up Despair of Gods Grace and Mercy, but let me tell you, when Men Despair of their own doings, and of all outward means and helps, then they are fit Objects for the mercy of God, and not till then; When the Lord looked and saw that there was none to Save and Deli∣ver, then his own Arm brought Salvation. God will not save tll then, God will not reveal his Power till Men have done with their own Power; they will never Trust God while they think they can do something for themselves. All the Forms of Religion of the several People of this Nation will do them little good without the Power; What is the meaning of that Prin∣ciple, that have such Masses and Prayers and Performances? What is the meaning of it, let us search to the bottom? They say, we are Sinners, when we Pray to God for his Blessing, and for Salvation by Christ; there is this at the bottom: They think these Duties and Performances will be very
helpful to their state, helpful towards the knowledge of it; to speak plain English, these are their Gods: If I speak of Pro∣phane and Wicked People, I would say their Lusts is their Gods: But when I speak of Righteous People that are meer Formalists, then I say their Duties, as they call them, are their Gods: When they have done all, they can do nothing for them, then they have no Gods at all; they are Godless: And if God doth not help them they are undone to all Eternity. When poor Creatures are Cast out as it were into the open Field, to the loathing of their Persons; not salted at all, nor swadled at all, but lying in the Guilt of their Blood: When I passed by thee, saith the Lord, and saw thee polluted in thy own Blood; I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy Blood; yea, when thou wast in thy Blood, I said unto thee, Live. When I passd by thee, and look∣ed upon thee; behold thy time was a time of Love, and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy Nakedness; yea I sware unto thee, and entred into Covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine. What was it a time of Love when I was such an Obeject in my own Eyes, that I thought I was the most miserable Creature
in the World? One that could not make a good Prayer, nor Dispute for Religion, nor Perform any Duty; a Poor Creature Cast out into the open Field, to the loathing of my Person; Lost all that I Gained; my Name was from among the Living, my Days were passed over in Sorrow, and I said there is nothing but Darkness, and Death, and Misery for me; I used all means, and tryed all things, save only a living Trust in God, a trust in God alone, and that Flesh and Blood cannot do; Flesh and Blood cannot know him, therefore Flesh and Blood cannot trust in him: Alas! said I, I cannot trust in the Lord, I cannot cast my Soul and all my Concernments, my Fame and Reputation in the World, I can∣not cast all upon the care of the Almighty, I cannot know him nor trust in them, how can I do it? No body can do it: They that know my Name, saith the Lord, they will put their trust in me; never a truer word was spoken, but how they should know God and trust in him, I know not. When thou comest once to this pass to be at thy Wits end, and not know which way to turn thee, nor to whom to run for help, or to ask Councel for thy Souls well∣fare; thou art come to the end of all, and
without hope, then God reveals himself by his Son Jesus Christ; Christ the Son of God is known by our coming to him, but none can come unto Christ except the Father which hath sent him draw him: When thou hast done with thy Gods, and thrown away thy Idols to the Batts and Moles, then thou wilt find the Lord, and thou wilt cry out, O that God would have mercy upon me, and lift up the light of his Countenance upon me, I am a poor miserabie Creature: There are many that make such a Whining and Complaining that they take a pride in their very Com∣plaints; their Hypocrisie is so great, I have known some that have prided themselves in wording their Condition and expressing their miserable case before the Lord, but suppose thou canst not speak at all, but feel∣est thy self miserable, thou canst not express thy Condition: At such a time as this God was drawing thy Soul to Christ Jesus the Mediator of it; I have heard of a Media∣tor, and that there is Balm in Gilead for me, that there is a Physitian there, that there is one Physitian, even Jesus Christ the Mediator of the New Covenant; thou hast sinned against him and grieved him; yet he stands with open Arms for thee, ready
to receive thee and embrace thee; where stands he? He stands at the Door and Knocks; it is a small matter, one would think, to let him in, Rev. 3.20. Behold, I stand at the Door and knock, and if any man her my Voice and open the Door; I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me. Here is good News for a hun∣gry Soul, if any such be here; Christ the Mediator stands at the Door and Knocks, he will come in and Sup with thee; if thou open to him, then we shall meet with the Lords Supper: This is the Lord, we will wait for him; he will bring his Bread with him. The Bread of Life and the Wine of his Kingdom: And the Lords Supper will be celebrated without cavilling and jangling. Now because we do not pervert the Scripture, I would have you hat under∣stand Books read what Commentators say; what those of this and former Ages say upon this Text, whether they do not Consture and Deliver in their Opinions that this Knocking at the Door is Christs Calling the Soul by his Grace, and this Door is the Door of the Heart, and Christs Calling the Soul by his Grace and Spirit to let him in by Faith: This is their Judgment and
Sense, and their Sense is mine, and I believe the Genuin Sense of the Text, that Christ would have People think he is near to them, and that he would have People open their Hearts and Receive him by Faith for to be a Saviour to them. No; that, saith Flesh and Blood, I cannot bear, I cannot consent to have him for my Saviour, I will not let him in, for he is like Micaiah to Ahab; He never speaks good concerning me. For if I have him for my Saviour I must part with my Lusts and Pleasures; if there be any other Saviour I will try, and not meddle with him; He will spoil all our Mirth and good Society, he will tell me of every Idle word that I shall speak, I must give an Account thereof at the Day of Judgment: What do you think that I can like such a Saviour? That I can live with such a one as will call me to an Account for every word I speak, and that if I speak one idle word Judgment will come upon me. No, I will try one and another, rather than accept of him upon such terms; I am one that am joyned to such a Church, and enjoy such and such Ordi∣nances, and such Helps: I am in Covenant with God, and under the Seals of that Co∣venant; I am Baptized and do partake of
the Lords Supper, which is another Seal of the Covenant; I hope it will be well with me. I will go something farther; another saith, we must have a Mediator; I will go to the Virgin Mary, and offer something to her, and pray to her,: Saith another, I will go to Saint James, and Saint John, and other Saints, to Intercede with God for me: They must have some Mediator. This is the Twisting and Twining of the Sons and Daughters of Men to keep out Christ the Great Mediator, who came into the World for this purpose to destroy the works of the Devil: Alas! I have nothing left but my bare Life and Living in the World; I have nothing left me but some Litle desire I had to please God; and that he will never Judge and Condemn me for; but my false deal∣ing and buying and selling with Deceit, He will Judge this, and Condemn it. And my Discoursing of things without me; all my Carnal Friendship and Love of the World, and my vain Fashions, all that is Corrupt and Defiled; these he came on pur∣pose to destroy: He came to destroy boh the Devil and his Works: What can a man Live in the World, and never joyn wih the Devil? Never Sin at all? Never do
any thing that the Devil would have him do? There is no Perfection in this World; no living without Sin here; then I am sure there is no Unity with Christ here, and if there be no Unity with Christ, then there is none with God the Father; What will be∣come of thee now? What will all the plea∣ders for that opinion say now? There is some thing stands betwen God and me, and I shall never have Peace; and what is that? It is Sin. I would have my Sin taken away, else I had better never been born: Canst thou remove Sin out of thy Heart? I have tryed, but I cannot do it; I have heard of Christ the Mediator of the New Cove∣nant: He saith, he came into the World, and that for this purpose he was manifested that he might destroy the works of the De∣vil. Now Sin in my Heart is the Devils work, I will see if he will destroy that for me; I will trust and rely upon him, and see if his great Power can destroy it in me. Here People come rightly to believe in him that God hath sent, and trust in him; and he will take them in, and like a Chirur∣gion he will rip up their Hearts, and lt out their Corrruptions, though there hath been never so much Rottenness, and he will heal them and purifie them and pardon them,
though they have been never so wicked, if they come to him; when thy Sins are set in order before thee, then thou cryest out, O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of Death? Is it God that hath thought of me; and waited to be Gra∣cious, and hath born my Sin long; how wonderful is his patience towards me? All these things working in the Soul tend to be∣get a Love to God, and fervent desires after being cleansed and purified from Sin; and earnest Prayer to the Lord to make that Ho∣ly Fire to kindle that would burn it up: The more the Soul trusteth in Christ, the more doth this Heavenly Fire burn up our Lusts and then a Man feels a great change in his mind. The things (saith he) that I delighted in are now grievous to me; I hope I shall never be found in those things again, my mind is now taken off them; who took it off? Didst thou not strive be∣fore to take it off? I did, but I could not do it. There are many I believe in this Assem∣bly before the Lord that are my witnesses in this matter, that when they came to Christ the Mediator he changed their minds, and he untyed the Devils fetters; they were tyed to their Sins and Lusts, but he hath unloosed
them, and set them at liberty; and they now find such a change, that they hate those things they loved; and when they come to think of them, they are ashamed, they are ashamed of those things that they formerly took pleasure in; What fruit (saith the Apostle) had you in those things, whereof you are now ashamed? So I say, what pleasure have you in Sporting, and Gaming, and Drinking, and Company-keeping? What pleasure have you to think of your Wanton Discourses? What pleasure in Pride and Vanity? What pleasure in Wrath and Bitterness of mind? And what pleasure in Malice and Envy? What plea∣sure have you in those things whereof you are now ashamed? So far as you are convin∣ced you are ashamed to think of them; I am ashamed to think that the Devil at such a time, by such a Temp∣tation should prevail over me. I would to God you were all come to this to be asham∣ed, that you might remember your past evil Ways and Actions with sorrow and shame: There is a secret Joy in this: Sure it is bet∣ter to be ashamed than to continue in impu∣dence. God hath wrought this change at last and who shall have the Glory of it? God shall have the glory of it, for his own
Works will praise him. What men do many times they do for their own praise, but when they are at their wits end and know not what to do, they cast themselves upon their Maker to see if he will have mercy upon them; if not, they must Perish; then for what he doth, he gets the Glory and the Praise of it. There are some here that are bound to praise God while they have a Day to live, for what he hath done for them; They could never have loved God with all their Hearts, but they would have continued Strangers to God, and the Devil would have led them Captive at his Will: They would not have loved God with all their Hearts, had not God first shed abroad his love upon their hearts, and constrained them to love him; it is he that hath first loved them, and wrought in them both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure. Whatsoever we are, we are by the Grace of God; this Grace is magnified in them that believe, and obey the Gospel: My Friends, we know there is so much Peace and Plea∣sure in the ways of God, so much Soul-satis∣faction in Walking with God, and loving of him with all our Hearts, That I should be glad that every one of you were of the same mind and had experience of it. We Labour
diligently for this purpose, and we would set before you these two things. First how we may come to know our mis∣erable State by Nature? What a blessed and happy Sate they are in, that have been Converted and Changed; that have been translated out of the King∣dom of Darkness into the Kingdom of God's Dear Son? Consider your State by Nature is Evil, we hope that many of you in hearing the Reports of the Gospel, concerning the good∣ness of the Lord; his great love in sending his Son into the World to seek and save you that were lost, and that you may believe in him. And we are perswaded that by the Foolishness of Preaching God will save some of you, that you may be his Redeemed Ones, and trust to no other Saviour, for there is not any o∣ther Name under Heaven but the Name of Jesus, by which you can be saved; He only can take away the Sns of the World, his Spirit searcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reins; which he promised to send into the World when he was leaving it. Now I dare Proclaim that Holy Spirit to be the Spirit of the God of Heaven, that now sees what Resolution thou art of, and what thou art now proposing to do; whether to go
on in Sin, or to return to God: This I can speak without Blasphemy; it is God's Spirit that searcheth thy Heart, and knoweth thy thoughts and purposes, and convinceth thee of thy Sin, God hath sent his Son Christ Jesus into the World to enlighten you, that by his Light you might see him, and that by his Grace you migh Receive him, and that by his Grace you might be saved. To him I commit you all; and these words that we have spoken are in the Evidence and Demonstration of the Spirit, according as he hath wrought in us. I must tell you we were never called of God to Study Sermons for you, nor to Preach things that are made Ready to our hands; but as the Lord our God hath wrought in us, and as God hath been pleased to make known his mind to us, and by his Spirit given us utterance: So we speak, and so we Preach: You that are come to believe and receive the things of the Spirit, you will Judge what I say: I speak unto you that are Spiritual, Judge ye what I say, saith the Apostle; so when I speak of Divine and Heavenly things, you that are Spiritual Judge what I say, and as you come to Judge and Determine in your selves that these things are true; you will feel the Power of them in your own Spirits:
And we shall all be of the same mind, and as we have One God, we shall serve him in sin∣cerity, and Worship him with Reverence; then his Name shall be Exalted in the midst of us, and we shall Edifie one another in Love, and we shall instruct one another, and call upon one another: Come let us go to the House of the God of Jacob, He will Teach us and Preserve us in his way, and do us good and keep us from all Evil. Turn your minds inward, and consider that God is a God at hand ready to help you, and he requires no more of you than of other People in former times, to love the Lord with all your Hearts, and to abstract and withdraw your minds from all other things that do come in Competition with him, and be sure to have no Trust or Dependance but upon him: Then see what God will do for you, no Tongue can express, nor Pen Write; neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive the things that God hath prepared for those that love him. That Wisdom, and Knowledge, that Joy, and Peace, and Consolation that passeth all un∣derstanding: He will reveal and Communi∣cate by his Spirit to them that love him, and trust in him and rely upon him, and re∣ceive teaching from him; he will feed them
with Food in due season, he will bring the former and the latter Rain, and they shall be as Trees planted by the River of Water, and bring forth Fruit in due season, and their Leaf shall not Fade, or wither. This hath been Londons wonder, and Englands wonder; How comes it to pass that such a Peoples Leaf hath not Withered nor Faded, as many have done? Our Root was by a River. If we had stood in our selves, if our depen∣dance and support had been upon Doctrines, Tenets and Commandments of Men, then our Leaf would have been upon the Ground as well as others; but because we have been upon Our Root Christ Jesus, that is, always Green both in Summer and Winter, there∣fore our Leaf hath not withered, to the Praise of God and the Honour of his Name be it spoken: He hath preserved us, for we have no Power of ou selves no more than others; but we trust in God, and have received Power from God to stand as witnesses for him; We have trusted in the Lord, and he hath stood by us; and delivered us when we were compassed about with Dangers and Distresses. If we continue to trust in him still, he will bring us through all our Tryals and Troubles, and he will be with us, and never leave us nor forsake us, if we take him for our God we shall never need any other.
We read that Senacherib King of Assyria, sent Rabshekah to Jerusalem, to Hzkiah with a great Army; saying, What Confidence is this wherein thou trustest, and he spake also to the People, and cryed with a loud Voice, hear you the Words of the Great King of Assyria, let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you; neither let Hezkiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, the Lord will deliver us, Hezekiah he went and prayed to the Lord, saying, O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the Cherubims, thou art the God, the God alone of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, thou hast made Hea∣ven and Earth, incline thine Ear O Lord, and hear, open thine Eyes O Lord and See, and hear all the words of Senacherib, which hath sent to Reproach the living God &c. And we Read that after he had presented his supplica∣tion before the Lord: The Angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the Camp of the Assyrians, one hunded fourscore and five thou∣sand, and when they aose ealy in the Morn∣ing behold they were all Dead Corps. Thus you see what came of it a last, and thus it hath been in our Day; they tht trust in the Lord he will deliver them, and they shall never be ashamed nor Confounded, but as for all other Gods, they that trust in them
shall be confounded and covered with shame, and they and their Gods will perish to∣gether. And now my Friends, I beseech you all to have respect to this great duty of putting your whole trust in the Lord, who is the Living God and he will be always present with you, and work in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure; he will support and preserve you in all your Tryals, and sufferings, that you may be Vessels of Hon∣our to bear his Name in the Earth, and to sound forth his Praise to the following Gene∣rations. His Prayer after Sermon. MOST Glorious, infinite, Powerful Father who hast Created us and given us Life and Breath, and lengthened out our time to this Day, and hast long waited to be Gracious to us, and art still waiting upon the Sons and Daughters of Men; holding forth the hand of thy love, and offering thy Grace, and tendering Salvation unto them, and hast brought a Day of Visitation upon the Inhabitants of this City and Nation: Glory, Praise and Thanksgiving be to thee, O Lord that by thy Power hast inclined the Hearts and Consciences of the
Sons and Daughters of Men to submit to thee, and bowed their Necks to the Blessed and easie Yoke of thy Son Jesus Christ, that they may do thy will on Earth as it is done in Heaven: They that are Traveling, and distressed, and Afflicted in their Souls because of their bondage, do thou arise living Father, and reveal, and discover thy Power to them, shew them the exceeding greatness of thy Power that they may trust therein, and be safe; make bare thine Arm for their Salvation: Those that are slumbering in their Profession, let them be a∣wakened, and bring to thine Heavenly King∣dom those that have passed through thy Refi∣ning Fire; and whom thou hast Cleansed and Sanctified: Powerful Father of Life carry on thy work among thy People every where, ga∣ther them that are scattered; and bring back to thy self those that are wandering and out of the way, and seeking the living among the Dead; Lord teach them and let them hear a Voice behind them, and guide them to thy Holy Mountain, that they may be brought to the path of Life, and to the place which thou hast provided for thy little Flock to meet and Feed together; Offering unanimosly the Sacrifices of Praise and Thanksgiving, which thou hast or∣dained and appointed in thine House. Blessed and Powerful Father, all thy little ones be
pleased to surround with thine Almighty Power; and where ever they are let them feel thy preserving Hand, delivering them from the Evil of the World: We pray not that thou should'st take them out of the World, but to preserve them from the Defilements and Pollu∣tions of it: That a Holy People may serve thee the Holy God; and bear thy Holy Name upon their Hearts, That, that above all may be ex∣alted and magnified, and humble Thanks∣givings and Praises may be given unto thee, through Jesus Christ, for all thy love thou hast manifested, and for thy abounding mercies, and renewed favours which we have received at thy hands; to thee living Father through Christ Jesus thy well beloved Son in whom thou art well pleased, be all Honour, Praise and Dominion rendred by us and all thy People, from henceforth, and for Ever, and Ever. Amen.
Sermon IV. The Standard of Truth. Preached at Grace-Church-Street, May 29. 1692. THERE is an Universal Standard of Truth that God hath set up over all the Sons and Daughters of Men; he hath given the Knowledge of it in and through Jesus Christ, he hath dealt it out to them, that they may be capable of joyning and adhering to the Truth, and to be delivered from Eternal Condemnation. This Standard and Measuring Rule is revealed, and mani∣fested in every Man and Woman, by the Light that shines in their Hearts; by which they are able to discern, and to give a sound and true Judgment (if they are but willing) upon all their own Ways. A Man or Wo∣man may know, in every word they speak, in every Action they do, whether they speak and do according to the Truth, or whether
they are justified by the Truth in what they speak and do. I tell you my Friends this is no small mercy that Mankind hath obtained at the Hands of his Maker, that he is brought into a Capacity of not acting blind-fold: but that he may see his way and his own Inclinations, and pass Judgment upon them whether they are good or evil, whether they will stand justified in the sight of his Maker, or whe∣ther they will be Condemned. I Confess the vail of Ignorance that is come over the Sons and Daughters of Men, through Sin, Transgression, and Rebellion, is very great. And I may say as the Apostle said, sometime you were darkness; and what can Darkness see? What can darkness dis∣cover? The Lord our God that made us hath not left us in that State of Darkness, Blindness, and Ignorance; but through the Riches of his Mercy and goodness, hath found out a way to command that Light should shine out of Darkness into Peoples Hearts for all that the Devil did to darken Man, to alienate and estrange him from his Maker. The same Almighty Power that said in the Creation. Let there be Light and it was so, he hath shined into our Hearts, and the way
by which he hath done so, is through the Mediator, through Jesus Christ the Re∣deemer, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells. He hath received Power from his Father, not only to be Light and Salvation, but to impart and Communicate of that Di∣vine Light unto them, even unto every one that cometh into the World, that so by means thereof they may be delivered from their Darkness, and Ignorance of the mind of God, that they were lyable to in the Fall; and might be restored through the Mediator to a Capacity of Judging of their own state as the Lord Judgeth, and of their own Actions, and of their own words, and ways and Inclinations. This is the Standard which God hath pitched in every one of your Bosoms for the Tryal of your selves; either for Justification or Condemnation of every Word and Action. Now to make every one sensible of the greatness of this blessing: Consider it is not only given to augment, and to encrease Knowledge; but it is given on purpose to allure and perswade Men into a likeing of Truth, into a Love of Truth: The Apostle esteemed it a wonderful mercy that came by Christ, he hath sent him to bless us, in turn∣ing
every one of us from the Evil of his ways, so that here is a Capacity that the Sons and Daughters of Men have, through the Mediator, of being turned from the Evil of their ways and doings to that which is well pleasing to God. The next work after God hath wrought thu mercifully for the Sons and Daughters of Men, is that they would be good to them∣selves, and merciful to themselves, and take pity of themselves; by a due Im∣provement of the Grace and Mercy, and kindness of God, that he hath be∣stowed freely upon them, and in bringing all their Deds to that Standard; all their words and Actions to that Rule, that so whatsoever they be, or how many so ever, if they do not answer that Standard and Rule, they may deny, withstand and resist them; that so they may keep out of Condemnation: For the Apostle declares it plainly without scruple: There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; If he had said, to them that profess Christ Jesus, there had been a large Latitude, especially for these Nations, but the Words are limitted, and you will find them so; that is, to them that are in Christ Jesus, and (as if he should say) that you may know rightly whom I mean; I
mean such as walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit: They that are in Christ walk after his Spirit, for, they that have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his; but they that are his, walk after the Spirit, the Spirit of Truth; and there is no Condemnation to them. It is not only the Scriptures that Ratify and confirm this Doctrine, but you your selves are all living witnesses of the Truth of this; that so far as you do act and speak in Obedience to the Principle of Truth, that God hath Planted in you; you feel no Con∣demnation upon you: Such a thing I did at such a time, and I had no Condemnation, Why so? Because I did it in Obedience, and Subjection to that measure of Grace that God set up in me; and such a thing I did, for which I was Condemned, why so? Bcause I did it according to the Inclination of my own Corrupt mind, and in Contradiction to the truth that opened in me. My Friends, I would have you in point of the Doctrine of Christianity to be the better for what you Read and hear; it is possible for me to Preach the Truth, and you may believe what I say, and you may Read the Holy Scriptures, and have the belief of what you Read, but if you come to a sensible feel∣ing
of the fulfilling of the things you hear, you will give a greater Seal to the Truth of the Doctrine, than by all you have Read and heard; and you will grow wise to Salva∣tion, by trying and experiencing the effect of every thing you understand: And not like the Carnal Men of this World, that have not Faith, that mind only their Worldly Profits and Pleasures; such are Earthly, Sensual, Devilish; but I would judge of Actions and Words, according to truth, and according to the effct I find in me: I did such a thing, and I had peace in the doing of it, I feel no Reproach, no Condemnation upon me; here is a way for People to grow up in the Life of Christianity, to keep to the Standard of Truth; for whether Men will or no, they must do it at last, and may now if they please, make a Tryal of their Words and Actions. As for the most part of you, you are got past Pilate, Pilate could make that enquiry, What is Truth? saith he; And I confess it is not long ago, it is within the Memory of Man that a more serious and better sort of People were confounded with the Darkness and Ignorance of those times that they were ready to cry out, What is Truth? And where is Truth? Their Eyes were so blind∣ed,
and things were so jumbled and con∣fused by the Disputations that Men Raised; they made things so dark that People could not see their way: but God who hath com∣manded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath brought a Glorious Day, that hath dissi∣pated, and scattered, and driven away a great deal of that Fogg, and Mist, that did over∣spread Mens minds: As many as have sin∣cerely sought the Truth in the inward parts, they have found a Divine Principle of Truth, that hath a self evidencing quality in it self; to convince the Minds and Consciences of the Sons and Daughters of Men, that it is the Truth: And to this the Lord hath brought most of you, to be sensible of some∣thing that is Truth in it self; There are many things that are true in the Words of them, many true Expressions; but there is Truth in it self, the Essential Truth of God, which as it is in God is Everlasting and E∣ternal, and will stand over all Errour, Fals∣hood, and Deceit; as the Truth is in Christ Jesus, it is a Standard and Rule for Men to act by: He hath given it to the Sons and Daughters of Mn, and as it appears in them, it is either a Judge to Condemn them, or a Saviour to save them from their Sins, and so to justifie them.
Now that which concerns us, is to find out that measure of Truth, or manifestation of Truth, or Principle of Truth; which it hath pleased God to reveal in our selves: And whosoever will turn their minds a little while inward, into the serious search and Consideration, how the Lord hath dealt with them; they will find they are not quite desti∣tute of Truth. One that makes it his practice to Lye, Cheat, and Cozen, or one that is a Lyar, is not utterly destitute of Truth; for there is a Principle of Truth in him, that doth Check him, and Reprove him for his Theft, Lying, and Falshood; and he lives under Condemnation in himself: He cannot draw near to the God of Truth upon any oc∣casion, but his Lying and Falshood stands in his way. Now if so be that this Lyar be made sensible of a Principle of Truth in him; do but bring his Words and actions to the Truth, so much of it as he knows will make him leave Lying, and Dceiving, and he must Practise Truth to escape Condemnation, and if he will but lave Lying and Falshood, and live in the Truth, and speak the Truth to his Neighbour; he will find another State, Condition, and frame in his Soul than there was before. He is now more at Peace, and hath a Clear and Serene way to come to God
by Prayer, and for pouring out his Suppli∣cation, which he had not before; for he had barred up his own way by his Sin, which lay continually at the Door; If thou dost not well Sin lies at the Door, saith God to Cain; so when you do Evil, you cannot but know it; when you are Drunk, or Swear, or tell a Lye, and deceive your Neighbour, and carry on the design of sinful profit, thou knowest it, whether Men know it or no, and God that made thee knoweth it, and there thy Sin lies at the door, and blocks and bars thee out, that thou canst not offer thy Prayers to God with that clearness, as if thou hadst spoken the Truth; so that it highly concerns every one of us to be wait∣ing upon God for the discovery of his Truth to us; and then we must Embrace, Adhere, and join to the Truth as our chiefest good. But some will say, this Adhering and joining to the Truth is a hard Lesson: It is pretty easie to find out a Principle of Truth, that standeth against and opposeth all manner of Evil. Very few now a days will deny a setled Principle of Truth in every Man, that judgeth Falshood and Condemneth de∣cit, and witnesseth against it in others, and in themselves: But this same joining, and
Adhering to it, that cannot be done without a Cross to a Carnal mind. Now if the Cross of Christ be not taken up, there is no good Christianity among us; where this is neglected, it spots and stains the Profession of Christianity; because it is so directly opposite to the Doctrine of Christ; He that will be my Disciple must, it is not, he may if he will; but He must take up the Cross of Christ and follow Him. There were a sort of People that were never like to be made Christians, that would be exempt from taking up a daily Cross; therefore he presseth it upon them to deny themselves and take up his Cross and follow him. No man is like to live a Christian Life without taking up a Daily Cross. This I cannot do, saith one, I know how to carry my self among Christians with Seri∣ousness, Sobriety and Watchfulness without shaming my Profession; but I cannot deny my self, I cannot contradict my own Will: This is that which keeps a man from leading a Christian Life, Then he cannot deny him∣self and take up his daily Cross. Now it is come to this, now a days when a Light is broke forth, and Men have a Principle of Truth in their own Hearts: It comes to this; saith one, I ought to be
Holy in all manner of Conversation, and to be Watchful over my Words; and have my Conversation Honest and Just without Deceit. See what a deal I know, yet I can never Live this Life for all I know it so well; I cannot take up a daily Cross which is so much against the contrary inclinations working in me. Then the Question I put to my self is, Shall I take up a Cross or no? Here it comes to the point with every Man or Woman after they come to the knowledge of this Standard of Truth: If the World would but come to this Rule and Standard, there would be no more Cheating, Couzening; no more Fraud, Deceit nor Emulation; nor War and Blood∣shed, if Men would but in every thing they do, answer the Principle of Truth in them∣selves; they would put the Question to themselves: Shall I take up a daily Cross or no? Shall I deny my self those Pleasures that my Conscience doth condemn? And those ungodly gains that I seek after by Falshood, by Lying, Prevaricating and De∣parting from the Truth, shall I do this, that I may be Rich and Great in the World? You know what I say, many of you, and
have put this Question to your selves, and some have made a good Answer to it: I will take up my daily Cross by the Grace of God; this Standard of Truth shall be the Rule of my Words and actions to my Dy∣ing-day. They that have learned this Lesson and obtained peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that have not only made a Resolution but performed it in Act and Deed, by the Power of Christs Cross they will be Purified and Sanctified and Washed from their Old Conversations, and Have their Conversation in Heaven; that is, Live after a Heavenly manner; Live a Godly Life here upon Earth, when they have come to this Resolution, and also to the Practice of it. I would desire and it is my Labour that you that hear me this Day; that are aware of what I am speaking, viz. The Stan∣dard of Truth. The Principle of Truth, that unerring Guide, which is placed in the Conscience of every Man, that Justifieth or Condemneth his Actions and Words: You that come to be aware of this, that you may all come to this Godly Resolution in your selves I would have this Dispute carry∣ed on in every ones Bosom; when the
Question is stated, I would have you real∣ly Answer it: Shall I guide my Actions and Words according to this unerring Rule or no? I cannot tell what to say, say some, there is danger in it: What danger can there be to answer that which a Man knows to be Truth? I will tell you what danger: The World is Perverse, the most men Live out of Truth; and the Devil is a Cunning Adversary, and he would have none Live in it: He abode not in the Truth; and he would not have us live in it, nor regulate our Words and Actions by the Truth in our own Souls: What if most Men in the World pervert the Truth? What if so few walk in the Narrow Way, and so few come to Life Eternal; therefore is that an Argument, I must not come there? should it not stir me up to greater diligence, that by any means I may be of the number of that few that shall obtain Salvation, and not go with a agreat company in the Way that leads to Destructi∣on; If we improve our Times and Seasons, and Opportunities, and Mercies, and Blessings that are vouchsafed to us; we at last may obtain Life Eternal. But some may say, I must sit down in Despair, for I cannot come thither of my self, though I do what I can to Work out my
own Salvation: There is a Decree against me, what though I should Pray never so much, and spend my Nights in Grief and Sorrow? If I be Decreed to Eternal Dam∣nation; there is no help for me, no hope that I should escape it: And if I be Decreed to Salvation, though I take my Liberty to Sin and be Loose and Wanton as others; it cannot hinder me from attaining Salvation at last. For this Reason many have laid aside the Spiritual Warfare against Corruption, and their Spiritual Travel, that they will do do nothing in order to their Everlasting Happiness; therefore they think they had as good take their Pleasure: But my Friends, the case is not now so with us; Let every Soul among us praise the Lord for his mercy in expelling that thick Cloud of Darkness, which is vanished and gone: This I know, and I hope you do all believe that God doth every where, and in every Nation call Sinners to Repentance, and that He delighteth not in the Death of him that Dyeth, but rather that they would turn and Live; and in order thereunto he hath given his Son Jesus Christ to be a Savi∣our and a Mediator, and he hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our Hearts to give
direction to us in our Way: Now our Du∣ty is to make improvement of those Visitati∣ons of Mercy that God hath bestowed upon us in order to our Salvation; and not Live in Rioting and Drunkenness, Chambering and Wantonness, Strife and Envying, and following the Fashons of the World: But we must Work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling. But some will say, Is not this done alrea∣dy? Is it not already wrought by our Savi∣our and Mediator? Christ hath tasted Death for every Man, and laid down a Price for the Soul of every Man. But there must be a change wrought in us: There is a Translation of our Souls from one state to another: This is called in the Scriptute Regeneration, and being born again, this is called a being baptized into Christ, and described also by other expres∣sions: But the matter is to Change thy Life, for there is a sinful Source of Wickedness that is stirred up by the Motions of the Powers of Darkness and our own concupi∣scence, but God is always ready to bring us under the Government of his Holy Spirit that will lead us into into all Truth; and this cannot be done without a Cross; but the Question lies here, Shall I take up this
Cross or no? if I do, it will Crucifie me to the World. Let me see; How much do I Love the World? A great deal: But do I Love the World better than my own Soul? What will it profit me to gain the whole World, and lose my own Soul? Or what shall I give in Exchange for my Soul? I cannot get to Heaven without denying my self; let me take care of my Immortal Soul; I am a poor Creature, I will serve the Lord my Maker, and make it my business to Glori∣fie and Please him: He can snatch me away by Death when he pleaseth, therefore I will labour that my Thoughts, Words, and Acti∣ons, and Conversation may answer to that rule, that he hath set before me, as a Standard of Truth to square and regulate my actions by. I will not live any longer in vanity as many do, I do not know but my Breath may be stopt to Day before to Morrow; therefore To Day while it is called to Day, I will hear Gods Voice and not harden my Heart, but receive that Counsel that is of∣fered to me for the benefit of my Soul; I am bought with a Price, I am none of my own, I will live to him that died for me, I have more Reason to live to Christ and serve him that shed his precious Blood for the Redemption of my Soul, and to be sub∣ject
to him; then to be subject to Christs Enemy, to the Prince of the Power of the Air that Rules in the Children of Disobedi∣ence; I will take up a Resolution to serve God, but I can do nothing of my self, but The Grace of God which brings Salvation, will teach me to deny Ungodliness and World∣ly Lusts; and to live Righteously, Soberly and Godly in this present World. Take heed of being deceived and beguiled for there is no way will bring you to Heaven, but an Holy and Undefiled way. Therefore come and take this Standard of Truth in your hands to guide you in your way, that you may neither turn to the Right hand nor to the Left; this will shew you the way you should walk in, and be like the Cloud and Pillar of Fire to the Israelites in their journey to Canaan which was a Type of Heaven; the Cloud they could see by Day, and the Pillar of Fire by Night; so this Standard of Truth will direct you in your Travel to the Heavenly Cana∣an: Let this be the Rule and Measure of your Thoughts, Words and Acti∣ons. If a workman that is a Builder hath a
Rule to work by, if he goes on and never examines his Work by his Rule, but makes his Eye his Rule; if he doth not bring his Rule to his work every little while, to see whether his work be right, if he worketh on and never mind his Rule; What sad work willl he make? But a Prudent Skil∣ful workman will say, I will not trust mine Eye too much, but I will look to my Rule, my Rule will not fail me; if there be bad work, it will discover it to me, that I may mend it before I go any further: Thus a discreet Workman will bring his Rule to his Work, and use his Line and Plummet that he may make it Workman like; He will say, if I let my Rule alone and not make use of it, but work as I please and trust to mine Eye, no wonder if I make bad work, and what I build fall down again, and tumble about mine Ears. You to whom God hath given the Stan∣dard of Truth as a rule and measure to Go∣vern your Thoughts, Words and Actions by: Let every thing be tryed with it before you Die and leave this World: If you do so and make this your daily practice; then ask your selves, and you will be able to tell your selves, and tell me, and say, I have now ob∣tained more hopes of Gods Favour and a
greater sense of his Love, and goodness to me than ever I had before. The Apostle doth exhort us to Walk Circumspectly not as Fools, but as Wise Redeeming the time. We have spent a great deal of time in vain; let us now be Wise, and Improve our time for our Eternal Advantage; let us walk Cir∣cumpectly, that is, look round about us, Consider our ways, and try all our Thoughts Words and Actions, by the Standard of Truth; To Day (My Friends) while it is called to Day, hear the Voice of God, and harden not your Hearts, and receive that Hea∣venly Counsel, that is tendered to you, that you may be partakers of the Inheritance, among the Saints in Light. His Prayer after Sermon. BLessed and Eternal Father, Thou hast brought forth thy Glorious Name, and Revealed thy Power, and thy Mighty Arm; and thou hast caused a Remnant to bow, and Worship at thy Appearance: Thou art Won∣derful, Thy Majesty is Great, they that do behold thee, will with Reverence Worship be∣fore thee. Thy Power is gone forth, and hath reached the Hearts of thy People; Thou hast humbled them, and subjected them to thy Di∣vine
Almighty Power; that they might ap∣pear in the Earth to the Praise and Glory of thy great Name: And O Lord as thou hast begun a great Work in the Earth, so thou hast committed this Work to thy Servants, and Children, that bear thy Name among the Sons of Men; that they should shew forth thy Right∣ousness, among the Inhabitants of the Earth; and our Souls have said many a time, Who is sufficient for these things? All our fitness and sufficiency, our meetness and preparation is from thee: Do thou Reveal thy Power, and make bare thy Almighty Arm. We have found thy Presence from day to day, and thou hast upheld them that know thy Love. O Graci∣ous God of Life, herein we have encourage∣ment to go on in the Work which thou hast called us to; hereby we are enabled to Worship before thee, and to offer up living Praises unto thy great Name, for that Refreshment and conso∣lation, which thou hast Ministred unto thy People: And, O living Father, We have never waited on the in vain; whensoever we have met together in thy Name, We have found thy Divine Presence, and the opening of the Treasures of thy Love; of thy Wisdom, and of thy Favour to thy Children: So that from day to day, and even at this day, thou remem∣berest thy People, and thou givest them fresh
occasion to draw nigh to thee, and receive their daily nourishment and strength from the ope∣ration of thy Power: O living God of Life, gather up the Hearts of thy People more and more, and draw them into a nearness to thy self; that their Understandings may be moe and more opened to discern thy Will, and sub∣ject themselves to thy Wisdom; that every Thought that is exalted against thy Divine Power, and living Voice in their own Consci∣ences may be brought down; that so all the Nations of the Earth may bow before thee; that so thy Truth may Reign, and thy Power may be exalted, and the Righteousness which thou hast Revealed, may shine forth more and more, in the Brightness and Glory of it; and en∣lighten those that are afar off that they may be brought to seek after God. And Lvng God of Life, let thse that are bowed down under the Weight of Sin, be supported and raised up; and those that are weary, and Heavy Laden, let them have rest to their Souls. Powerful God of Life, keep thy People in a fresh and living Sence of thy love, and of thy Heaven∣ly Vertue, by which thou nourishest thy Chil∣dren, and satisfiest them from day to day; Not only when they are met together, but when they are separated from one another: let thy People be preserved from the Evil of
the World, while they are in it, and let thy Wisdom and Power give them Victory over it, that thou mayest have the Glory of all thy Mer∣cies and Blessings, vouchsafed to them: For thou alone art worthy, who art God over all Blessed for Ever, and Ever. Amen. Sermon V. The great Duty of Remem∣bring our Creatour. Preached at Devonshire-House, April, 6. 1692. THERE is only One Living and True God, Creatour of Heaven and Earth, whom we are obliged to serve and Worship; I have so much Charity as to believe, there are none among us but will own and Ac∣knowledge this: And my Soul wisheth that this Obligation did always rest upon every
ones mind, that they might Remember their Creatour, that hath given us all Life and Breath; and continued all our blessings to us, that so every one might apply their Hearts unto that Universal Duty, that we are all convinced of. And they that are thus imployed, and exercised; they are considering, how, and after what manner they may quit and dis∣charge their Duty, and perform the Obli∣gation that lies upon them, so that it may be accepted at the hands of God; I speak now of those that are considerate, not of those that go on in a Form of Religion, and matter not nor Regard whether they are accepted of God or no; but all that are Conscientious towards God, they are desirous to serve God, and Worship him, (so as they may be acceptable to him) so to perform duties that they may receive their reward, and that Encouragement, that God in all Ages, hath discovered and made manifest to be in his Purpose towards them that truly serve him. When People come to this Consideration how they may serve God aright, and wor∣ship him acceptably, the Lord is nigh unto them to instruct them, to teach them, and guide them in that way that is Everlasting:
And blessed be his Holy Name, a great many in our days have met with this Divine Tea∣ching and Instruction; and are taught in this Age, as in former Ages, to Understand the Worship of God that he requires, that is in Spirit and Truth; and do find that the Father doth seek such Worshippers, and where he finds them, he rewards them: And they have an Answer of Peace in their Bosoms, and they are encouraged to go on in the Worship, and service of God to the end of their days. And it is a great mercy, and benefit, a great blessing that God hath bestowed upon a Remnant; so opened their Understandings to let them see, and know the way of being near to God, that so People may know whom they Worship; for you have Read, there have been Worshipers that do worship they know not what: As our Saviour said to the Woman of Samaria, You worship, you know not what: We know what we worship, so all that are taught of God do know which is the First Lesson of Christianity, as the Apostle saith, He that cometh to God must first know and believe, That he is, That is, People must first be sensible, that there is a God, and that he is a Rewarder of them
that diligently seek him, before they can rightly Worship him. Now for want of this knowledge, the World is scattered, and People are divided into a great many sorts of Worships, and Fashions, and ways of Religions, for want of the Knowledge of the true Worship, of the True and Living God; so that though Men are Universally Convinced, that there is a God; and that a worship is due to him from every one of us, yet People are con∣founded, scattered, and divided about the performance of their great Duty: And in the Day that the Lord hath visited his Peo∣ple he hath come to Answer this doubt, and Question for them; it hath been the great Question of the World, and is still of many Thousands: I know we should Wor∣ship God, but I know not the way and man∣ner wherein to find acceptance; The Lord hath Answered that Question in abundance, They that have Ears to hear, let them hear what the Spirit saith; there is a short Answer to it all. Let People profess what Religion they will, there is no acceptance with God, but through Christ; so that if People come to be of this, and that, and the other Religi∣on, and change their Religion never so often,
and go from one Religion to another: If they come not to Christ, they come not to him, in whom they may find acceptance; in him God is well pleased with every one, but out of him, he is pleased with never a one: The great Mistery of Religion, it lies in Christ; People must come to God, by Faith in him; for without Faith it is im∣possible to please God; let People perform never so much service, and duties, all must pass through the hands of the Mediatour, before ever their performance will reach un∣to God, or before Peace and Comfort will reach to any Mans Soul. Therefore, it is the wisest way for every one that would have acceptance with God to come to him, in the Name of the great Mediatour: Peo∣ple would be glad to have acceptance with God, and not to have their services turned back upon them, as Cains was; every one that will have acceptance with God, must come this way, there is but one way. It is not the way that Men have invented, some by their Works and Merits; some by their made Faiths, and made Beliefs; and by divers Articles, and Principles, holding this Principle, and the other Principle; but our Lord and Creatour, he hath found out one way in his Infinite Wisdom, and un∣speakable
Mercy to Mankind, that was for ever lost, and could never return to God by all his Sacrifices, Offerings, and perform∣ances; he was never able to return into Unity with his Maker: If God had not found out a way; and the way that God hath found out, is by his Beloved Son Jesus Christ; God spared not, He spared not What? He spared not his only begotten Son, Why, what did he do with him? He gave him for the Life of the World; in him that God gave, there is Life: It pleased the Lord that his Son should have Life in him, as the Father had Life in himself; for Christ was with the Father, before the World began; in him was Life and the Life was the Light of Men. John, 11 4. It was no Created Life, that Life, that is in his Son is not a Created Life; but it is Eternal Life, and it was given for the Life of the World, and that Life is the Light of Men: This is the true Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World; so that here is the Dignity of that Life which God hath bestowed upon us; we are indued with that Life, which was with the Father through Jesus Christ, be∣fore the World was: Let us Consider the Dignity of that Light, that we are lighted with.
The Question is, whether we should obey this Light or no: It is the Question of every one; I am enlightned, saith a Man, shall I obey it or no? If I obey, I must take up a Cross, and part with my beloved Lust, and Corruption: No doubt of that, we must perswade People to do that, before we can bring them to Heaven, and happiness and Fellowship with God; it must not be by that way they lost it, but by the contrary way, by which God will bring Men to Happiness again: They lost it by Trans∣gression, and Sinning against God, by this way and means Men came out of the Pre∣sence and Favour of God, by what way shall they obtain it again? Shall it be by committing Iniquity, and breaking Gods Law? No, here is the way that God hath found out to bring poor Man back again to himself; by the Suffering and Obedience of his Son Jesus Christ: He hath given to him all Power in Heaven and Earth, that all should be Subject to him; here is a Dignity which Christ hath obtained. It comes to the Question with us whether we are inlightned, (Now we know we are Enlightned) God hath bestowed something upon us, that Wars and Fights against Sin and Iniquity: How came we by it? Is it
any faculty in Nature? No Nature is Corrupted and Defiled; because the Carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not sub∣ject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; yet there is something in me that Answers the pure Law of God, that which makes me to hate things that are Reproveable; that is Light: How came I by it? It is not Natural, for then it would run Parallel with that Natural Inclination, that is in my Soul to lead me, further, and further from God. These are set in opposition one a∣gainst another, the Flsh and the Spirit; The Flesh Lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh. Here is part of an inward War, that you may be all sensible of. Now these two Warriors, the Flesh and the Spirit make War one against another, and one of them is over come: It is true, there is such a Principle in me that strives against Sin, and Corruption; How came you by it? If you believe the Scriptures, I say, it is the Life of the Son of God, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World. Now many that have rejected and despised the Light, I believe they did not think at the same time to mock, and make a scorn of the Life of Jesus, though it was really so; but if People came to a true esteem and
value of that Light, that God hath planted in the Soul; they would give more reverence and respect to it: It is this that brings those that Preach Christ, to Preach him in those terms, and under those Denomina∣tions that he is nigh them. We do not doubt of Christs being born of a Virgin in the Land of Canaan, and that he wrought Miracles; and Preach∣ed many Godly Sermons; and that he was Crucified, Dead and Buried, and Rose a∣gain from the Dead, for these things are certainly true; we would have him our Saviour in this Age, we would have a nearer knowledge of him, and a sense and feeling of the virtue of that Power by which he saved them that lived in former Ages: He is not a Christ and a Saviour of one Age only, but of all Ages to this Day, from Adam to the last Man that shall live upon the Earth: That Age and Generation that knoweth not Christ will not be saved by him; if there be any Age wherein he is not known: There is no other Name under Heaven by which you can be saved; if you ask where is this Saviour? Say not in thy Heart who shall Ascend into Heaven, that is, to bring down Christ from above; or who shall Descend into the deep, that is,
(to bring up Christ again from the Dead?) The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth; and in thy Heart; that is, the Word of Faith which we Preach. He is nigh thy Soul, he is the Lord of Life and a Quicken∣ning Spirit: If I know that Quickening Spirit, after this I know the Lord Christ, when he comes to work in me by his Power changing my Heart, and translating me from Death to Life; then I know the true Christ: God hath manifested in all Ages that it is the Duty of People to come to the knowledge of the Son of God, for he hath sent forth his Spirit for to teach us, and to lead us into all truth. For when Christ was with his Disciples he told them that he would pray the Father, and he should send the Spirit the Comforter; and when he came he would be known by his Divine and Inward Teachings and Ope∣rations, guiding and leading them into all Truth; that was his work to them: But what shall other Folks do? He will be made known to others too: When he comes He shall convince the World of Sin. So that his work to his Disciples was, to lead them into all Truth; and his work to the Wold is, to convince the World of Sin. Who will deny but that there is a Spirit in our
Age, as well as in other Ages that will con∣vince men of Sin? Is this the Spirit of God that convinceth the World of Sin, or is it the Spirit of the QUAKERS only? When People come to consider really and truly how they may serve God aright, they will find there is no serving God aright un∣less they come to Christ the Mediator, that in and by him they may put up suppplicati∣ons to God, and through him they may expect at the hands of God Peace and comfort; and there is no other way, nor never will be. The Jews they had another way, they had an outward way of serving God, this stood in divers Offerings, Sacrifices, Wash∣ings and Observations; this was a way of worship of Gods own institution to that Peo∣ple, but what came of it? When the Apostle came to grasp it, he said, The commers there∣unto were not made perfect: What were the transgressors of it then? They that would sin on, and continue in sin; and not bring a Goat or a Ram or other Oblation; they that did observe it and came up to the point of the Law, they did bring their Offering when they were convinced of their Sin: If a man sinned he was to bring a Hee Goat, and to bring it to the Door of the Tabernacle; but when he sinned, the consci∣ence
of sin, the guilt of sin remained upon him. For it was impossible, saith the Apostle, that the Blood of Bulls and Goats should take away the Sin: For if the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the Unclean Sanctifieth to the Purifying of the Flesh; how much more shall the Blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit Offered himself without spot to God, Purge your Consciences from Dead works to serve the Living God? When there is no hope of attonement and reconciliation with God by all those offerings under the Law, he tells you of one offering of the Son of God himself through the Eternal Spirit by which he became a a Propitiation; for thus will it do: If I be∣lieve that Christ offered an Holy Offering to the Father for my sins, I believe he offered his Body and that through the Eternal Spi∣rit, that he might be a propitiation for sin, and take away sin; and have Power over Sin and Death, and conquer Death and Darkness: the Apostle drives the matter far∣ther, you must come to the inward Work of this outward Offering, this Eternal Offering that was in due time Offered to God; you must come to know the Operation of it by the sprinkling of the Heart from an evil
Conscience, so that there was to be an Appli∣catory Faith for the offering of that: The way to a Saviour was not made by Man, no more than the way of Salvation by Christ was found out by Man: No more than the Application of the benefits is effected by man. Where it pleaseth God to call a People by his Grace, he calleth them to his Son, not by this and the other Form: No man cometh to me, saith Christ, except the Fa∣ther which hath sent me draw him. The first thing that a Man or Woman comes to be aware of, is the secret sense and feeling of the Lords Divine Power upon the Heart, to seek Christ Jesus: As soon as they feel this and embrace it, this will be a Token of the Love of God; I hope all this Con∣gregation will acknowledge that they have sometimes felt his drawings, and that they have not embraced and closed with them so well as they ought. When the People are aware of these drawings Inwardly to Holiness and Righte∣ousness and are sensible that they should with care and intention close with them for the good of their Poor Souls; and that it concerns them to be happy in the other World, that World that is to come? and
therefore resolve to be led by these drawings of the Spirit of God; these are not weeds that grow in the Field Naturally: These are sparks of Divine Fire kindled in the Hearts of Men by God himself; No Man comes unto God, till God cometh to him and touches him, and gives him sense and mo∣tion; these are the motions and stirrings of Gods Holy Power in the hearts of many that are wicked and Abominable. Yet the Lord doth not despise the work of his own hands, but reacheth to such. When the Lord meets with these that Despise not but highly Prize this wonderful Grace, and Close with it, and are Glad of it; such a one saith, I feared that the Lord had forgotten me, and had passed me by and had done with me; but I see he Visits me again, and he hath Visited my Soul this Day, inclining me to walk more answerably and suitably to his Love, he hath doubled his Power upon me and hath kindled a holy Fire in my Heart, and caused me to seek after him: He hath touched my Heart, and I will Pour out my Soul in Supplication, see∣ing he hath touched me: He will take hold of e by his Power and he will keep me from being any more drawn away, I will live in the sense of his Power and mercy
that keeps me Night and Day, that I may encrease in it, and grow in Grace. When the Lord meets with such a one he will draw him to the way that he hath appointed, none can come unto me, saith Christ, except the Father which hath sent me draw him. If I am drawn, into what form shall I go now? And what Ordinance shall I take up now? This is all under Feet: This is none of my Work, I will come to Christ the Mediatour, and he will take the Government and Rule of me; It is not my best way to study for a form and an outside Religion. I will wait upon that Power that hath thus touched my Heart, that he may by degrees bring me to the Obedience of Christ. But some are ready to say, Who and What is this Christ Jesus that you are speak∣ing of, that Immediate Christ Jesus that is extant and present; that I am to have to be the Object of my Faith? That I may be∣lieve in him, and come to Acquaintance of him; that I may partake of the Life of Christ Jesus and have it Communicated to my Soul. It is true we have not a thought, or a word to speak, that may Derogate from the wonderful Grace of Christ, who died in his
person on Earth for the salvation of our Souls: Yet we must know that the Lord Jesus Christ may be Spiritually present with us, and take the Government of us, and we are to be subject to him. How shall this be? I am speaking of one that hath felt the Fa∣thers Drawings when he draws them to his Son, and draws them to something that is Holy and Pure: This God the Father hath begotten; we read in Scripture; that God hath begotten Christ who is the only begotten of the Father. It is strange, you will say, to speak of begetting Christ again, God begets Christ again, that is, spiritually, he being the first born in many Brethren, in every true Believer, and there is a travel of Soul that Christ may be Formed in him. See what Travel of Soul the Apostle Paul falls into the second time, for the Gala∣tians: They were a brave People, they wor∣shiped God in the Spirit and believed in Christ Jesus, and afterwards they came to be seduced by false Prophets, and false Teachers; that set them about their Works, and told them that they could not be Justified and saved without their own Works: These false Teachers that came among them, were as bad as Popish Priests and Friers. It is not your Obedience to Christ, and the Spirit
will save you, you must be doing: So these Poor People were deluded and bewitched, to give you the Apostles own Words, and so they were Infatuated, and drawn away from the Simplicity of the Gospel, and they thought by the works of the Law to obtain Salvati∣on. The Apostle writes a Letter to them, and tells them that he traveled in birth a∣gain till Christ was formed in them. If this was not Scripture it would look like a strange work, there must be a forming of Christ, a Birth there must be, and a begetting; Who must beget in this and that moment? But the same that begat from the beginning, the same is the Father, he begets Christ in all that believe and obey the Gospel. He is be∣getting something in me that is Holy, though I be unholy; the Father by the Operation of his Divine hand begets something in me that is Holy: This I find though I am not so good as I should be, I have that given me that will tell me, that the more I adhere and joyne my self in my desires and Affections to this good Principle, the more I shall per∣take of the Quality of it; this good Principle, though it be like a little Grain of Mustard-seed, I cannot tell what to compare it to for Littleness, in comparison of the Great Lump and Mass of Sin, Corruption and Filthy∣ness,
that Wars against it. This will Over∣spread all that is bad and make me Holy, as that is Holy, Pure as that is Pure, and to have a Love to Him from whence it came, even to God and Christ. It will gather the Affections from Corruptible things, and place them upon things above. This Faith tells People that it is the sub∣stance of things hoped for; and the evidence of things not seen, such a one lives by Faith, such a one that comes to be joyned to that, that is begotten of the Father: He lives by the Faith of the Son of God, and can do nothing of himself but through Christ that strengthens him. They say unto God, I per∣ceive I can do nothing without thee, I can∣not Pray unto thee, nor serve thee, of my self I can do nothing acceptably, but through Christ the Mediator; such a one becomes like a little Child, and he must be Led, and who must Lead him but the Spirit of Christ? You cannot Preach, saith one to him, unless you be moved by the Spirit: You cannot Pray till you be moved by the Spi∣rit; How should I? No, without him I can do nothing, I cannot Preach, nor Pray, nor do any thing Acceptable to God the Father but by Christ, and he hath Revealed him in me.
This is no new Doctrine, we see the new and Living way: It was an old way to old Christians, and a new way to the new; and so a Thousand Years hence, if the World last so long, Men will see that they cannot do any thing pleasing to God, but as they are gathered into Christ, they will see their own Righteousness, works and doings will avail them nothing at all. This is all laid at the feet of Jesus whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to be Lord and King. Now my Friends, we are engaged in this Age, abundantly engaged to offer thanks to God, through Jesus Christ, that he hath pro∣vided and opened a way for the sending forth the Spirit of his Son: And that God hath gathered a People, and hath made known to them the way of Life, that they might walk in it; but there is no walking in it but through a Daily Cross, and self-denial: It is not likely that a Man should be brought back to God the same way that he went out from God, and the Prophets and Apostles do allude to this turning to God, When thou turnest aside to the right Hand or to the left, thou shalt hear a Voice behind thee saying, this is the way, walk in it. There is a Voice that calls to People in
our Days to look behind them, for they are out of the way: This Prophecy is fulfilled in our Days; we cannot turn away from the good ways of God, but we may hear a Voice behind us saying, thou art sinning a∣gainst God, and breaking the Holy Law of God. Now if People return, it must be by the Cross; I will not return to God, saith one, I have Pleasure, Profit and Honour, and whatsoever my Heart can desire in this evil way that I am walking in, if I re∣turn I shall have nothing but shame and Re∣proach, I shall be undone and ruined; and I shall lose the Favour and Friendship of my Friends and Relations! I cannot return to God but through a Daily Cross, and self Denial; What then? It's likelier to be the right way, this bearing the Cross. Christ tells us If any will come after me let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me. This Voice of Christ calls me to repent and turn from Sin, and giveth me a strong Argument, that it is true, that it is the same way that will bring me back to God by the Mediator. It brings its own Evidence with it: We need no Argument to prove that it is a right way: It is a right way because it is the narrow way. It is the right Gate, because it is the strait Gate:
Every body can walk in the broad way with ease, without any Cross. When People are come thus far that they are convinced of their Duty, when they are called to amend their Lives and Conversati∣ons, to forsake their Sins and turn to the Lord: This is the great Question now; Have I Power to do this? This Question hath stumbled a great many; when they have some beginning thoughts of turning to the Lord, and at last they have setled them∣selves in a belief that they cannot do it; it is true, and nothing truer, that Men Convinced of their Sins, have not Power to leave their Sins of themselves: This is true, but not all the Truth; to Men that God convinceth of Sin, He gives them Power to be made willing to forsake their Sins. He hath given Power to all that are in Christ Jesus to believe and become the Sons of God; then they have denied ungodliness and Worldly Lusts: If they be the Sons of God, and live. Righteously, Soberly and Godly, in the World. But what shall they do that are sensible they have not Power to forsake their Sin, till God is pleased to give them Power? Such have nothing to do but to wait upon the Lord, for the giving of this Power, and
then I have a Duty Incumbent to me to Answer this Power. The Apostle upon this subject tells us what People are to do for their own Conversion: He ascribes the Pow∣er of Conversion to Christ Jesus. The Prophets and Apostles they tell us, there is something for Man to do, that is, if he hath not Power, he is to be willing to receive it. The Apostle hath a notable Expression to this purpose: He puts them in mind, how they used to do by the Devil, when they were the Devils servants, they did obey his Commands and yielded their Members ser∣vants to Unrighteousness; How did they yeild? They did it Heartily with pleasure and delight; thus you did when you did not know the Power of God, but now you are come to the knowledge of the Power of God. Yield not your Members as Instru∣ments of unrighteousness unto Sin, but yield your selves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your Members as Instru∣ments of Righteousness unto God. Rom. 6.13. Let your Minds and wills and Affecti∣ons, be joyned to that Power which God Visited you with; in Love to God, give up your Members as Servants unto Righteous∣ness. Here is something for Man to do in the
Day of Gods Visitation; Thy People shall be willing in the Day of thy Power, That they may come to that, and experience that; this shews that they are the People of God: But they that are not a willing People, are none of Gods People; but Gods People are so: And I pray God make you all so, to be a People willing to be Gods People, when he gives you Power, and it will not be long before he gives you Power to for∣sake your Sins, to forsake this, and the other Foolish Proud and vain Action, and fashion; he hath made Christ Jesus to be Lord and King, and he shall Reign over Death, he hath made all things by Christ; and he is become the Saviour of all Men, but espe∣cially of them that believe; so that I would have a special Salvation, and thou wouldest have it too; Christ hath made a way, and opened a door for us to be saved, that we might have an abundant entrance into his Everlasting Kingdom. But I would have a special Salvation, that will invest me with the Love of God in my Heart before I die. It is to be had only through Christ, there∣fore to him will I come; to him must every one come, and every Knee bow to his Name, and every one must wait to his appearing in the Spirit. When Christ appears, Truth
stirs: Now if a Holy Divine Life is in thee, it is He; if a Principle of Truth stir in thee, it is He: The same Jesus, only in a smaller Manifestation; He that is Faithful in a little, He will make him Ruler over much. This is he that God hath ordained to be the Captain of our Salvation; this is that which we Preach in his Name, and testifie and declare to all People, that there is no other Saviour: No deliverance from Death and Hell, but by, and through him; In him there is Reconciliation, and that Peace, which passeth all Understanding; and Power over all those things, which have Captivated us; and made us disobey our great Lord and Maker: Let us wait for the coming of Christ. He is our King, our Lord and Lawgiver, and he will save us: This was the cry of his People of Old, for the glorious and great Salvation he hath given, and the Work he hath wrought. Let the Prayers and Supplications of all People that desire Salvation, be put up more and more; that he will visit the Earth, and give Power from above, and bring us into that New and Living Way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the Vail; that is to say, his Flesh; to whom be Glory for Ever, and Ever. Amen.
His Prayer after Sermon. BLessed and Eternal Father, thou hast brought forth thy Glorious Name; and revealed thy Powerful and mighty Arm: Thou hast caused a Remnant to bow and Wor∣ship at thy appearance; thou art wonderful O Lord, thy Majesty is great, and they that behold thy Glorious appearance will bow, and with humble Reverence Worship before thee: Thy Power is gone forth, and hath reached the Hearts of thy People; thou hast humbled them, and subjected them to thy Di∣vine Almighty Power, that they might ap∣pear in the Earth; to the Praise and Glory of thy great Name. And O Lord as thou hast begun a great Work in the Earth, so thou hast committed this great Work to thy Servants, and Children that bear thy Name among the Sons of Men; that they should shew forth thy Righteousness among the Inhabitants of the Earth: And our Souls have said many times, who is fit and sufficient for these things? All our sufficiency and Preparation is from thee; do thou make bare thine Arm, and Reveal and make known thy Power: We have found thy Presence with us, from day to day, and thou hast upheld them that know thy
Love. O Glorious God of Life, herein we have Encouragement to go on, in the work that thou hast called us to: Hereby we are enabled to Worship before thee, and to offer up Living Praises to thy great Name, for that Consolation; that thou hast Ministred unto thy People. And O living Father, we have never waited upon on thee in Vain; when ever we have met together in thy Name, we have found thy Divine presence, and the opening of the Treasures of thy Love, of thy Wisdom, and of thy Favour unto thy Children; so that from day to day, and even at this day thou remembrest thy People, and givest them fresh occasions to draw nigh to thee; and to receive their daily nourishment, and strength from the Operation of thy Power. O living God of Life, gather up the Hearts of thy People more and more unto thy self, and draw them into a nearness to thy self; that their Un∣derstandings may be more opened, to discern thy will, and subject themselves to thy Wis∣dom: that every thought that is exalted a∣gainst thy Divine Power, and living Voice in their own Consciences, may be brought down; That so all the Nations of the Earth may bow before thee, that so thy truth may Reign, and thy Power may be exalted, and the Righteousness which thou hast revealed,
may shine out more and more, in the bright∣ness and glory of it; and inlighten those that are afar off, that they may be brought to seek after thee. And O thou living God of life, and power, let those that are bowed down under the weight of Sin, be supported and raised up: And let those that are weary and heavy laden, have rest to their Souls. Powerful God of life, keep thy People in the fresh and living sense of thy love; and of thy Heavenly Vertue, by which thou nourishest thy Children, and satisfiest them from Day to Day, not only when they are met together, but when they are separated from one another; let thy People be preserved from the World, while they are in it, and let thy Wisdom and Power give them Victory over it: That thou mayest have the Glory of all thy Mercies, and Blessings vouchsafed to them, for thou alone art worthy, who art God over all Bles∣sed for Ever, and Ever. Amen.
Sermon VI. The Divine Monitor: OR, Light from Heaven. Preached at Grace-Church-Street. June, 19. 1692. IT is a great Priviledge to the Sons and Daughters of Men; that it hath pleased God Almighty to open a way, how they may come to the true Knowledge of him∣self: And O that there was a Heart in every one of us that could rightly prize this Pri∣viledge, as they ought to do: for in the Knowledge of the true God, consists our true Happiness; and without this, the mind of no Man or Woman can be be good: there is nothing seasons the mind and Soul of Man, and prepares, and fits it for an everlasting well∣being;
but the Divine Knowledge of the living God that made him: And there is a Propensity in the Soul of Man, even since the Fall, to return again to God; and to have that acquaintance, and Communion with the Lord that Man had before he fell; and they that have regard to that inward spark of Divine Love, that they find in their own Souls towards God, they will experi∣ence that the Lord is merciful and Gracious, and Propitious to that which is of him∣self. For though the Soul is lost, and Man is lost through transgression, and a great Alie∣nation is happened between him and his Maker; yet the Mercy of the Lord endureth for ever. And his kindness and favour to lost Man is such, that he stretcheth out his hand all the day long; and presents, and offers to the Children of Men, a Friendship and Acquaintance, and a Communion again with him; and though by Sin and Transgression there is a rebellous Nature grown up in the Sons and Daughters of Men; yet the Soul of Man is not wholly so, there is something that strives and labours in a contrary way, and persuades the Soul to turn again unto the Lord, and to wait for the knowledge of God, and whosoever hearkens with care and
diligence to that Divine Monitor that is daily drawing and persuading People to seek af∣ter God, they come to understand that the Lord is not so Angry with Mankind, but his Love and Mercy and Good-will reaches towards all the Sons and Daughters of Men; and the Bar that hinders their Communion with God, and Peace with God; it is not in the Lord, but it is in themselves; and therefore the remedy must be wrought in themselves. This is evident to every Eye, that there is something gotten into Mankind, which the Holy God cannot own, and can never have fellowship with: That is, another con∣trary Spirit hath wrought upon the Souls of People; and hath seduced and drawn them out to that which is unholy and contrary to God, and the terms of Gods Covenant with Mankind; which is, that he should forsake that which the contrary Spirit hath wrought: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts. Why should he forsake his ways? Because the Lord never led him to those ways: He that made him never led him into them, but the Devil the Enemy of Mankind sedu∣ced him into those ways; therefore the Creatour cries out to him; Let the wicked
forsake his Ways and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts. I cannot have union with him as long as he walks in his evil ways, I cannot dwell in his mind so long as evil thoughts are in it; so may the Lord com∣plain of the works which the Devil hath wrought, that Man is carryed away from God by his evil thoughts, and the works of the Devil. Why doth not God destroy those works when he is Almighty and able to do it? Very true, God is so; but he hath offered to Mankind through the Son of his Love a way and means, how Man may come to be purged and cleansed, from the evil that the Devil hath wrought in him; and how he may come to be reconciled to God: God hath not chosen the way of Coertion and Force, and to work altogether by irresistible Power, that Man shall go to Heaven whether he will or no; there was no force used for his going to Hell and Darkness, but it was the choice of his Will: The Devil could not have forced Man and Led him away out of Covenant with God, he could nor compel him to break the Ho∣ly Command of God, but the Devil tempt∣ed him, and he yielded to the Temptation, and now Man is driven out of the presence
of God; yet God hath found out a way for the Sons and Daughters of Men to return again to him; what, by Force and Coertion and Irresistible Power? No, but the Scripture saith, he hath offered Faith and Salvation to all Men: He hath freely given the Son of his Love out of his own bosom, who making himself an Offering for sin, hath presented a way and means for Mans returning again to God. How doth God present Christ to us? he presents him to the view of every ones mind, to the understanding of every Soul. He Offers and presents him for Salvation to the ends of the Earth. There is Damnation come in by Man's being subject to Satan: But Salvation comes in by his being subj ct to Christ; as Damnation came in by his being defiled; so Salvation came in by his being cleansed: As the Devil is the Defiler, so Christ is the Cleanser, and Man is the object upon which both do work; and they that have been defiled and corrupted (as we all have) by the unclean Spirit: Can any of us give a reason why we should not be cleansed by the holy Spirit: we have lost our Right to Heaven by Sin and Trans∣gression in the first Adam: And can any give a reason why we should not be Restor∣ed
and Redeemed by Jesus Christ the second Adam? No reason can be given of our Re∣demption, but that God is free in his Love, and Christ in his Offering: He hath Offered himself a Sacrifice for Sin: Every Priest hath something to Offer. This Man, the Man Christ Jesus offered himself through the E∣ternal Spirit, a Sacrifice for Sin: And now the Sacrifice is Offered, and a Door is opened, and a new and living way consecrat∣ed through the Vail, that is to say his Flesh, Now who can be wise enough to find out a reason why all men enter not in at this Door? for all Men Run in at the other Door which the Devil and Adam opened to run from God; all could run in at that Door; what is the reason that all run not in at that Door which Christ hath opened and God hath Revealed, and which cost Christ so dear to work our way back again for Mankind to return to God? If we go about to enquire into the reason we shall find it very little; for there is all the reason in the World we should serve God, and seek our own Happiness. There is all the reason in the World we should part with Sin and Iniquity, and with the Devils Work which he wrought if we knew but how: now this I say is a great Priviledge that God hath
afforded to the Sons and Daughters of Men, that they may know; for here is the terms of the Gospel and of Salvation brought to a narrow compass, to a short sum, there needs no Catalogue of them, they that will be ruled by the Wicked one must have their part with him, and they that will be ruled and Governed by the Holy one, shall have their part with him, that where he is, there they may be also. Is this in the Power of Man's? Will no, there lies the mischief in the will of Man, for you cannot but know by Experience, if a Man may have his own will, he will al∣waies run headlong to Destruction, and run in the way of Wickedness: And if ever he comes to turn out of that way into the way of Righteousness, he must do it in a way that is Cross to his own will. Some have said because we have spoken of the Free Grace of God in a way that is universal, of his kindness to Mankind through Jesus Christ, they have said that we hold Free Will, that Men might be saved if they would; but alas! We have tried it, and we have an Uni∣versal Knowledg that is able to convince us and all the World, that it is far enough from our own will: Man is far enough from being able to save himself, from being saved by his
own will, he can run on to Damnation, there is a Current goes with his Affections, and with his Corrupt desires, they go with the Current and Stream: As long as a Man goes on in Sin he Swims down the Stream. Now many after they have long gone on in Sin, and their evil ways, they think of re∣turning to God, for they think there is a bet∣ter way, and a surer way, and a safer way for their Souls, than to go on in wickedness; so there is; if there be so, saith the sincere Soul, O that I might walk in it, Why dost thou not? I am convinced that I see a more excel∣lent way than my way is, a better walk∣ing and Conversation than my Life is, but Alas! It is too hard for me to walk in it. Why? What is the matter? What makes it hard? Because of my own will, I cannot walk in it and have my will, I cannot walk in it and enjoy my Affections and Desires, and my Interest in the World. This is no wonder that thou tellest me; now thou art Convinced of a better way, and wouldst walk in it, and thou canst not walk in it but thou must take up a Daily Cross; we might all of us tell that, and read it before. I pray God you may come to read it within, what a Cross it is you are to take up, and what a way it is you are required to walk
in, that it is the way o God, the way that leads to Heaven, it is a Narrow way; the way that the Devil would have you to walk in is a Broad way, there is no Rub in it. O! Would you but once come to Expe∣rience how hard it is to walk in that way that leads to Life; you will find that you cannot do it without self denial. It comes to this point, I read of it before, but now I find it so; such a Man, or such a Wo∣man will seriously apply themselves to live blameless, harmless and Inoffensive towards God and Man, they will set a Bridle and a watch before their mouth, that they might not speak a vain Word, they will take care of the frame and Temper of their Minds, that they Sin not in their Thoughts; that they Sin not with their Lips, nor with their hands: This is not as I was wont to do, I was used to have my liberty, now I find my self yoked, I dare not Sin against God. Now I find by experience what I heard before that no Man can follow Christ, without de∣nying himself and taking up a Daily Cross. I would have you experienced in this work; wicked Men think it is a pleasant Life to follow the Devils work and to walk in the Broad way; but the way of self-deni∣all
is uneasie, there is much strife and oppo∣sition in that way; If I have a mind to speak a Vain word I am Limitted, if I have a de∣sire to wrong my Neighbour and cheat and defraud him, I am Limitted; I am not to do it, that belongs to the Broad way; if a Man will seek after the Lord, and walk in the way of Holiness and Righteousness, the end where∣of is Peace, he will find it is a Narrow way wherein he cannot enjoy his own will; such a one must be a David, who said, I behaved my self as a weaned Child; that is, as one that is affraid to be Beaten. But thou wilt be ready to say, I am a Man, and not a Child, I am come now to be a Man; a Man of Parts, I have seen much and read much, and would you have me become a Child? What a great Man was David? If you speak of a Man, he was a Man of Dignity and Honour, a Man of Valour and Experience; yet when he speaks with respect to the frame of his mind before the Lord, he saith, he behaved himself as a weaned Child; as one that feared to be bea∣ten, feared to commit an Offence: He fear∣ed the Rod of his God upon him, he feared Judgment would come upon him, he feared something of Judgment upon his Conscience. David was an Old Testament Man, but he
had regard to that which never waxeth old, but is the same in all times new and old, Alpha and Omega. Christ Jesus was his leader be∣fore he was born of the Virgin Mary; his Word was a Light to his Feet, and a Lan∣thorn to his Paths. David had Acquain∣tance with God, who did lift up the Light of his Countenance upon him. And when Christ himself came to Preach upon Earth, he saith himself: Every one that comes into the Kingdom of God, must be∣come a little Child. He must become as a little Child in Simplicity and Subjection, he must be under Government; he must become like a little Child, or he must in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven. They must not think to enter into Christs Kingdom be∣cause they are Men, Men of Parts, Men of Courage, Men of Understanding; Learned Doctors, that are Masters of Liberal Arts and Sciences. These may help to make them Men, but they must be Children, all their Wit and Parts, and Manhood, Courage and Valour will do them no good; for little Children, Babes and Sucklings may under∣stand more than they of Divine Misteries, and have greater Communion and Enter∣course between God and their souls than they, so that whosoever enters into Christs
Kingdom must become like little Chil∣dren. So that here is a way provided by Je∣sus Christ for Man to come again into the favour of God; which is by Christ alone, not by any thing that a Man can do, Christ must be their leader and their Counsellour, he a∣lone can give them the true knowledg of God. No Man can know the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son reveals him. Men can never attain to the saving knowledg of God by study, and by Dispu∣tation and reading Books, and Commenta∣tors, and Observators of matters of Religi∣on. Time would fail me to speak of the multitude of Books that have been written about the Knowledg of God: You must come to Christ for Divine Knowledg; Theo∣logy, the Knowledg of God, and Divine and Heavenly things is from Christ; he shall have this Divine Knowledg, be he never so simple that comes unto Chist for it, he can∣not have it any other way, for God hath ordained this way; saith God, he shall have it of my Son, who is the Reconciler, the Me∣diatour between God and Man, he shall be beholding to Christ for all. All Mens own works and labours will not Justify and save them, for God hath Committed the whole
work of Salvation to Christ: One would think it should be no great matter for Men to lay aside their own works and Duties, and submit to Christ; but I tell you it is very hard, and I found it hard my self. Men think by reading and Learning and hearing this and the other Mans Notions and Opinions they may be edified and proffited, and come to the true knowledg of God; but while they are waiting upon God in the way he hath appointed, they may receive knowledg from Christ and be more certain and Infallible in what they do know, than by consulting all the wise Men, and learned Doctors in the World: For no Man knows all at once, and no Man knows all things neither; it is not a thing necessary that a Man should know all things in relation to God, for as he is in himself he is incomprehensible. For no Man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall Reveal him. Yet that which he knows of God he may know it as certain and Infallible. Suppose a Man know nothing of God, but that he is the searcher of Hearts and the trier of the Reins: There are many have read this, and say they know it; that yet doubt whether there be a God or no: But when God comes within them and convinceth
them of Sin, and searcheth them, and brings Judgment upon them for what they have done; then they know Infallibly that God is the searcher of Hearts. This is not Mans work, this is the work of God; if I find God doth approach my Spirit, I know it is Gods work, I have now got some knowledg of God, how came I by it? who gave it me? No body but he that hath all Knowledg, he that was with the Father from the beginning; and was Glorified with the Father before the World began, he gave me this Knowledg; and how did he give it thee? By this Spirit, for he hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into my Heart, and that Spirit of Christ searches the Heart, and tryes the Reins: He tells me this is Evil that thou hast done, this is that which God that made thee hath against thee, this thou must forsake, and this thou must Repent of, here I have an Infallibility of what I know, but I cannot get Rid of my Evil. Now if I can believe in that Power by which my Heart is search'd, and trust in him that hath begun to deal with me, then his work is not only to Reveal his Light to convince me, but to put forth his Power to convert me, so that by the Power of that truth by which my Heart is search'd, I come to be con∣verted and turned from my Sin, and break
off from it; and when I am broken off from it I am sure, and have a certainty that it is so, that I am broken off from such a Sin, and that my Heart is turned against it; I am sure that now I hate it, and detest it, and that God hath turned my Inclination another way. I am sure this is Gods work, I can witness this Infallibly that something is now done in order to my Redemption: But there is something yet Remaining to be done, What then? I will go step by step, by fol∣lowing my Guide. I shall be sure to be make∣ing some progress every Day to that state to which the Spirit of Christ will lead me. These Persons come to a certainy of knowledg by their own Experince. Some will say, take heed of being deluded and decieved by the Quakers, so say I too; Take heed of being deluded by any body, if any go about to perswade thee to believe that which thou knowest to be a Lie, I am sure they are about to delude thee, I would have every one to have an evidence in themselves of what they believe. Doth a Man believe such a One is a Drun∣kard, because the Scripture declareth Judg∣ment against the Drunkards; the Scripture saith, Wo to the drunkards of Ephraim? There are Judgments denounced against Drunkards
in the Old Testament; consider the Scrip∣ture doth not tell such and such by Name that they are Drunkards; but the Spirit of God by a Work and Operation upon a mans Conscience singles him out and charges him with the guilt of Drunkenness. There is great condemnation pronounced against Whoremongers in Scripture, but it doth not tell such who they are by Name, but their Consciences find them so, and give infallible judgment against them, and saith, Thou art the Man, thou art a person that God doth Judge and Condemn; Whore∣mongers and Adulterers God will Judge; but that doth not concern thee, and affect thee, except thou be one; I may read this an hundred times in Scripture, and not have a reflection in my own Conscience, except I be guilty: But when God meets with a guilty person and Judgeth and Condemneth him, there will be an infallibility in what such a one knows. If a Whoremonger is reflected upon by his own Conscience, if his Consci∣ence tell him he is the Man; if all the World should flatter him and say he is not guilty, he would certainly know that they tell him a Lie. So that here is no Dependance upon any mans judgment, but upon an invisible Judge
in a mans own Heart; Who shall delude and deceive this Man; that hath this expe∣rimental knowledg? Those persons will not deceive a Man that would turn him from the evil of his ways, these do not go about to deceive him that will tell him he must hearken to that Principle of Truth and Holiness in his own Heart; they would de∣ceive him that tell him he is converted when he is not, and leave him there: But when he is really converted and turned from Sin to God, some will tell him he is deluded and deceived; I pray God every one of us may be so deceived; saith the Apostle, We are Deceivers, yet True. All that are truly converted, though Men cry out they are deceivers, though they are deceivers yet true; they are come to the savour of the know∣ledg of God through Christ, and so they shall certainly Come to be partakers of the inheri∣tance that is undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Friends you know that this hath been the Proposition of all the Prophets and Apostles from the beginning to this Day; the thing that they have proposed to the Sons and Daughters of Men, hath been to enquire after the knowledg of the true God: It hath been wonderful to consider what the
Devil hath done to present divers Doctrines that he hath found out, and stirred up o∣thers to invent a Company of Gods that other People have Adored and Worshipped. It is hard to find any Nation that do not Worship some God: It is Natural for Man to desire to come to some God, he thinks he must come to some God; and cannot be hap∣py if he come not to God: But the Devil hath invented so many Gods and set Peo∣ple a Worshipping of Idols, the Work of Mens hands; such Gods that are so far from helping their Worshippers, that they cannot help themselves; they can∣not wipe off the Dust from their own Fa∣ces: And if they fall down they cannot rise again. But this is not our case, we have but one God Preached among us, and but one Lord Jesus Christ the Mediatour between God and Man: Our condition is happy in having but one God, in comparison of theirs that have many Gods. If the true God that you Worship were but trusted in, you would be the happiest People in the World. If you do but search, you will find that the Devil hath in this Na∣tion and in this Age, stirred up People to wor∣ship as many Gods, as he did in other Na∣tions
in Antient times, among the Sidonians, the Amorites and others. But you will say, we Worship one God, and trust only in one God, and one Christ, and one Holy Ghost, the only living and true God. Do not tell me what God a Man professeth to worship, but what God he trusteth in, that gives it the Name: Whatsoever a Man trusteth in, that he makes his God; whe∣ther it be Gold and Silver, or the Honours and pleasures of this World; if he trusteth in these things he maketh them his God. Let a Man but search and try himself, and he will find something hath got a place in his Heart, that he cannot part with for Christs sake: He will be ready to say, I cannot part with my House and Land, with my Wife and Chil∣dren, and my Goods and Possessions, because I have a Confidence in them, and believe they will do me good, and be a Defence for me: I may trust in times of Peril that these things may do me good then. Here is a Di∣vine Adoration, here is that trust, that Confi∣dence that all true Christians ought to have in the true God. And this is placed in these Earthly things; now wheresoever the trust and Confidence is placed in Transitory and Earthly perishing things, these Men trust in transitory Gods.
Nothing so shewes that a Man makes the Lord his God, as when he casts all his care on him, and puts his whole trust in him, when he makes a profession and acknowledgment of his dominion and greatness, and of all his other Perfections, that by his Wisdom he can pro∣cure for them all that is good, and by his Power put off from them, and secure them from Evil. When I make the Lord my trust and refuge, and trust him for my God, I chuse him before all the Gods of the Hea∣then, and trust in him, above all things un∣der Heaven, upon the Account of the profun∣dity of his Wisdom, and the Almightiness of his Power; when a Man hath this sense upon him, he will walk before the Lord with Resignation of Mind, and be willing to be at Gods disposal, and he will not only give up himself to God, but he will hearken to him, hear his Voice when he speaks to him. God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past, unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last Days spo∣ken to us by his Son. But, Where is his Son, you will say? He is in Heaven; but though he is the High and Lofty one that inhabits E∣ternity, yet he dwells with meek, humble and contrite Hearts, that tremble at his word. If
I be one of the number of those that tremble at Gods word, I have Gods promise that he will come Home to me, and dwell with me: It is well for thee if the over-ruling Power of God hath prevailed upon thee, that thou canst be willing to be at Gods Disposal, and say, Lord, What wouldst thou have me to do? Therefore Friends I would advise you all, in Love to your Souls, that when God desires your Hearts, that you would give them up to him, that there he may delight to dwell, and have his habitation: Hearken to Gods Voice; and have regard to his word, which is a more sure word than any Mans in the World: There is a more sure word of Prophecy, saith the Apostle, unto which you will do well to take heed. This will check you and reprove you when you do Evil, and shew you where∣in you have Transgressed, and will encourage you, and be a Comfort to you when you do that which is good. This will make you wise to Salvation, and throughly furnish you and give you understanding for every good work. This word will tell you, this you must not do lest you offend God, and wound your Conscience, and grieve the Holy Spirit; this word will help you so to speak as to Admi∣nister Grace to the hearers; such a one as
hath regard to this word, hath a Chaplain in his own Bosome: That will direct and teach him how to stear his course, and order his Conversation among Men, and how to serve God acceptably: This High Priests Lips will preserve knowledg, even Jesus Christ, The Righteous, who speaks to us in his Word; we can do nothing but by his Direction: If you come to him to lead to you into all truth, he will bring you the Father, reconcile you to him, that you may obtain his Favour and Everlasting Life; when one of Christs Disciples said; Shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us; Jesus saith unto him; He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: And, How sayest thou then, shew us the Fa∣ther? If you subject your selves to Christ, and to the Government of his Spirit, he will bring you to that Life and Immortality that fadeth not away. This hath been our Labour and Travel from time to time, to Preach Christ among you, and not to Preach our selves, and ga∣ther a Church for our selves; but to gather a People in to Christ, who is Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth: We would Preach Christ Jesus the Lord, we would not have you Admire Mens words and sayings, and charge your Memory with them: But we would
have you remember the words and sayings of Christ; who is the great Mediatour to recon∣cile Man again to God, that you may know him by his Power working effectually in your hearts; we Labour for nothing else, and we want nothing else. We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: We pray you in Christs stead be ye Recon∣ciled to God: That you may so Live, that whether you Eat and Drink, or whatsoever you do, you may do all to the Glory of God; your great Creatour, that hath given his Son to Die for you, and Redeem you from all Iniqui∣ty, that you might be a peculiar People zealous of all good Works. Therefore let God have all the Honour and Glory, for all his mercies and Blessings; Let us render to him Hearty Praises and Thanksgivings, for his wonderful Love, and ackowledg that it is a great priviledg that we may obtain by Jesus Christ, even to be brought again to the true knowledg of the living God, which we lost by our Transgres∣sion. His Prayer after Sermon. GLorious art thou in thy Appearances O Lord, and very wonderful is thy Pow∣er, and thy ways past finding out: And in
this thy glorious Day, thou art opening a way for the Sons and Daughters of Men to return to thee: And O Lord those whose Eyes thou hast opened rejoyce, and are Glad, because they have seen the way of thy Salvations and the breathings of their Souls are, that their Feet may be kept therein, and that they may make straight steps in their way to thy kingdom: And O Lord we are sensible that our strength, and our Power, and our Ability is only in thee; and therefore are the Souls of thy Children bow∣ed and subjected to thee: Waiting for the Re∣newing of thy Power, that as our Temptati∣ons are renewed from Day to Day, that thou wouldest make known thy Power in us, that we may feel the stretching forth of thy hand to save thy little Ones, out of the hands of the Destroyer. And so Powerful God of life, break forth more and more in thy Glory, and make known thy Power, in expelling the Clouds of darkness and ignorance; and bring the Minds and Understandings of thy People, to know thee more and more, till they come to the blessed Inheritance among the Saints in Light; Holy and Powerful Father break in upon thy People by thy Almighty Power, and scatter the dark Clouds of Temptation, and cause the light of Life to shine upon them; thou that hast commanded the Light to shine out of
darkness, do thou shine into the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men. Open their Hearts that they may receive thy Truth, and make tender their hard Hearts, that they may live to thee that Created them; and give a comfortable Account to thee of their Thoughts, Words and Actions, and let them turn to thee before it be too late to repent them. Powerful God of Life, thy mercies and loving kindness do abound to a little Remnant that do believe in Christ and do trust in thy great Name: Thou hast been with them in their fiery tryalls and tribulations, and to this Day thou hast been the glory of our Assemblies, and the joy of our meetings: We are sensible of thy holy Power working in our Souls, and of thy renewing thy love upon us: All that want a full sense thereof, that are seeking and crying after thee for it; O let them be brught to a due sense of God: O arise for the help and the Comfort of the Sorrowful, the Sighing and the needy Soul; pour forth the treasures of thy love upon them that follow hard after thee, and breath for deliverance, that so Powerful God of life, praises may arise to thee, for all thy mercies and abound∣ing blessings, for thy goodness and loving kind∣ness bestowed upon us, from time to time. Most Powerful God of life and light, let the Eye of thy Favour be turned upon this Land of our
Nativity; spare the inhabitants of this City and Nation, that they may seek after thee, let them know the weight of thy Hand upon them, to bow them down to humility and bro∣kenness of Heart. Give them Repentancee for their Sins; Living God of life display thy Power to all from the highest to the lowest a∣mong us, and advance the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom thou hast given a Name above every Name, and let his king∣dom and glory be exalted over all, and shine forth in the midst of us; Blessed Father of Life, give wisdom to our Counsellers, that they may Counsel for thee. Make known thy will and send help from Heaven to all that stand in need thereof, and that wait upon thee for it: Give them thy Holy Spirit that they may be guided in thy way; let thy Son Jesus Christ have the stearing and Governing of all things, and let Glory be rendered to thy great aad worthy Name, and keep us in the Love of God and in Union one with another; let the stroak of thy Power remain upon the Hearts of all, whose Hearts thou hast touched at this time; let them be bowed down always in thy Holy Worship, and remain in a belief of thy truth, and cease to do evil and learn to do well, and walk ac∣ceptably before thee, that so Transgression may be finished, and Sin and Iniquity may be put to
an end; and that Truth and Righteousness may be set up, and shine among us, and that our Souls may rejoyce in thee, that we may mag∣nifie and praise thy Power, and Glorifie thy Name; for thou art worthy of all Honour, praise and glory, and humble thanksgivings for the manifestation of thy love and Power: All which we desire to offer thee through Jesus Christ, who art God over all blessed for ever and ever, Amen. Sermon VII. The Inward Preacher Or, The Office of Conscience. Preached at Grace-Church-Street. June, 21. 1692. My Friends, MAny have been sent among you, that from Living experience have declared
their Testimony for the truth, that you might all be brought to wait for the testimony of Truth in your selves. This is that which will stand you in stead to know the testimo∣ny of truth in your own Hearts to be for you. Therefore you are to wait, especially at such times as these, to hear the Voice of Truth in your own Souls. For whatsoever the Preacher preacheth, if the Truth in thine own Heart doth not speak Peace, it is not well with thee. Whatsoever testimonies are born of the Truth it self; it is the Truth that must bear testi∣mony of thee: That unerring Word that gives to every one an Infallible evidence of their Peace with God, or against that which hinders them. You know our labour hath been to per∣swade all People to hearken unto the Truth in themselves, and to make it their business and travel and endeavour that they might have unity with the Truth in their own Hearts, that their Consciences may not con∣demn them. For such as you in whom God hath raised his witness, and hath exalted his Truth for a Judge: You are not Ignorant, nor covered over with darkness as many others are; you do not remain in doubt, but you know the Truth, and have an Answer of Peace in well
doing, and a condemnation in evil doing; not Administred to you only by Preachers without, but by the evidence and demonstra∣tion of the Spirit of God in your own Hearts. This is that standing Ministry which God hath raised, which can never be put down again, but as each one may put it down in themselves. I grant that Men may put it down: You have read, and had it plainly witnessed to you, even killing the just and Crucifying the Lord of Glory, and of spiritual Sodom and Egypt: These things you have read of, and you that are turned to the Light, know the meaning of those sayings by woful experi∣ence; for when ever you have turned aside from a due subjection to rhe Grace of God, by which we are convinced, then there hath been a piercing, and Crucifying the Son of God a fresh, and a vexing and a grieving the Holy Spirit by which you should be Sealed to the Day of Redemption; then there hath been Anguish and Tribulation upon your Souls. And if this be minded, it will plant a fear upon the Heart, and make you affraid to do the like again, but where this Tribulation, and Anguish is neglected and put off; there a custome of Sin takes away the sense of Sin: As you know many have had more Judgment
at sometime upon them for a vain word, or a vain Thought, than afterward they have come to have for the most abominable wick∣ed Action; How come this to pass? Was Sin ever the better? Or hath it changed its Na∣ture? No, but they are further off from the sense of the evil of it, this is the word of Truth, to which you must stand or fall, this is the Stone that whosoever falls upon it shall be broken and tendered: But if they stay till the weight of Truth fall upon them, it will grind them to Powder. They that will have a life of liberty; let the Truth say what it will, I will have my liber∣ty, and use my Tongue as I list; I will be wanton and proud, and envious and malici∣ous, though I know these things to be nought, and the witness in my Conscience testifies that these things are wicked, and contrary to the will of God, yet I will have them; whosoever comes to this Mind, the Stone is near falling upon them and they will be ground to Pow∣der, they are like the barren Earth which beareth Thorns and Briars, and is rejected, and is nigh unto Cursing, whose end is to be burned. Therefore Friends I entreat you to hearken to the Word of the Lord, it is a holy Word, an old Word, many have
professed it: There are some Preachers that will cry, Hearken to the Word of the Lord in such a Chapter, and such a Verse; My Testimony this Day is Hearken to the Word of the Lord; but where shall we find it, some will say? I tell you, it is written with the Finger of God in your own Consciences, and is either for you or against you: Let your Profession amongst Men be what it will, this Minister of the Covenant hath no respect of Persons, or regard to Profession, he will not excuse this or that Man, because he makes a greater Profession of his Name than others; this rather is his Judgment, and his Condemnation shall be more swift and sharp upon him that makes a Profession of Christs Name: If Judgment begin at the House of God, what shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel of God? These that take upon them a strict Profession, they do greater dishonour to God, than those that cry out there is no Reformation, there can be no Living without Sin; these Profess what they do, and they do as they Profess: But when People come to Profess Holiness and Righteousness and Profess a Power also by which Righteousness is obtained; but live not strictly according to their Profession; these are they, That cause the Name of God to be
Blasphemed among the Heathen; more than they that say there can be no living with∣out Sin, Now this Witness of God hath no re∣spect to Profession, but hath respect to the Sate and Frame of the Mind of a Man or Woman that they serve God with, whe∣ther it be with sincerity and uprightness of mind, and with breathing desires, that They may know the good and acceptable Will of God, and what is well-pleasing in his sight. And that they might perform that which is, according to his Heavenly will. Where this sincerity is, where this cry of the Soul is the Lord hath regard to it; but where Peoples Religion is only to bear up a Pro∣fession, and hold up an external Fellow∣ship and Communion one with another; when this sincerity is wanting the Lord ab∣hors their Worship, it is an abomination to God, and no benefit or advantage to themselves: It is not for the glory of God that they make a Profession, but for some design to themselves: and so they become abominable, This was the state of Israel of old, and it is the state of a great many now, that think they do great matters if they conform so far to the Truth, as that outwardly they may
not be charged with a Lie, but that they are of such a Society: it is well if some would come so far as to maintain their Soci∣ety with Gods People and their external Profession; but if they have not regard to Truth in their own Consciences, what is their Profession worth? What will all thy Unity with them signifie? If there be a breach between God and thine own Soul, who can heal that breach? What will their Profession signifie and amount to at last? But, Go you cursed into Everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. And all the reason to be rendred for it is this; Depart from me, Ye are workers of Iniqui∣ty. He did not say in that sentence, ye are Lyars, you never Prophecyed in my Name, and I never preached in your Streets; but allowing what they said to be Truth, that they had made a Profession, and held Com∣munion with other Christians; allowing these things, yet notwithstanding it is, Go ye cursed; and the reason of that Sen∣tence is, You are workers of Iniquity, Let the dread of the God of Heaven rest upon you. My Friends, it is another thing to make a Profession of the Lord God of Hea∣ven and Earth, than most are aware; Let every one that Names the Name of Christ
depart from Iniquity, What is Iniquity? It is all things that a Man or Woman doth to gratifie their own wills contrary to the will of God, that is Iniquity: Where had all Men Liberty? Where had Adam and his Sons their Liberty to fulfil their own wills and to contradict the will of God? Yet nothing is more common in Nations, Coun∣tries and Families, than for People to assume a Liberty to perform and fulfil their own will, and to bring about their own Interest, Designs and Contrivances; though at the same time they are convinced that it is con∣trary to the will of God. Where this Liberty is taken, there Iniquity is wrought; that is Ini∣quity which is unjust, that which is commit∣ted against him upon whom we have all our dependance every moment for Life and Breath, for Food and Raiment, and every thing we enjoy; we have a dependance upon that God that made us; yet vain Men and Women assume a Liberty of gratifying their own Wills, and setting up for the Flesh. You may remember that passage of the good Apostle when he saw some Libertine Professors of Christianity grow loose and care∣less; it is well they thought that they did ac∣knowledge God in their Meetings, and Wor∣ship; but as to the Affairs of the World,
they had forgotten that God was concerned in those things; the Apostle takes notice of such a Libertine looseness, Go to now, you that say, to Day or to Morrow we will go into such a City, and continue there a year, and buy and sell and get gain: Whereas you know not what shall be on the Morrow; For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour, that appear∣eth for a little while, and then vanisheth a∣way: For that you ought to say; if the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that. You ought to live in subjection to him that made you, you ought to have regard to Gods honour in whatsoever you do, Whether you Eat or Drink, or whatsoever you do; do all to the glory of God. Is not this Scripture? Is not this found amongst the Apostles Writ∣ings? Do not we hold the Name of Christi∣ans which was given to them at Antioch? Yea we are called Christians, and these writings of the Apostle are holy writings, and what then is the matter that we take so little notice of them? That men do not apply these whole∣some Exhortations to the particularities of of their Conversation; but that they go from Countrey to Countrey, and from one place to another, and do what they please, without having any regard to give their subjection to to the Great God: This
Loosness hath brought into the minds of some such a Liberty that they live without God in the World; when they go sometimes to Re∣ligious Meetings, and when they hear the Name of God mentioned, it may be there come a little awe upon their minds; and they have some regard to that God that gave them Breath and being, for the present: But if there be not Religion; if there be not a Tie; Re∣ligion signifies a Tie, a being bound to God; if men be not bound and tied to God, by that which is made known to them, every one will desire that which is good in their own Eyes. Therefore it is necessary for you my Friends, above all People, you that are come to your measure of the Ministration of the Spirit, and know it, what it doth speak; Such a thing I did this Morning, and I am reprov∣ed for it: Such a thing I did well, and I am Justified and warranted in the doing of it: Thus it is when a thing is well or ill done; Sometimes some Men Act two or three Days together and never bring their Actions to the rule, that is like a Man that is building and never minds his rule, so what he builds up Tumbles down again upon his Head. You know there is something in you, that hath a speaking Voice, an Infallible Voice, and gives Judgment on your Actions, and passeth a sen∣tence
either of Justification or Condemnation upon you. If you would live so as to answer God in what you do, you need not fear an∣swering Men: I do not fear answering Men in all I do or speak, if I do but answer mine own Conscience, I fear no Man, though they be of another perswasion, in their Judg∣ment opposite to me; if I keep peace in mine own Conscience, I shall answer the principle, of Truth in my adversaries Consciences, though they hate me, and despise me, and seek occasion against me, if my Actions an∣swer the Truth of God in my own Heart, they will answer the Truth in any Mans Heart: This makes a Man as bold as a Lion. When the People of God obtain a Repu∣tation to be true and just, and holy and righ∣teous; all Men will expect Holiness and Righteousness at their hands: What if I pro∣fess to be one of those People? If I have not the Truth in my own Heart. This reputati∣on though I put it on as a Cloak to hide my Insincerity, the want of that Truth takes away my Courage. It is Truth in all Men in the World that hath a Power, and it is the Power of Holiness and Righteousness that makes wicked Men affraid, and therefore the Apostle argues upon that subject, the Magi∣strate is clothed with Power, what Power hath
he? The Power of Justice, and the Power of the Sword; What Sword hath he? A Sword of Justice, and he is a Terrour to evil∣doers, but a praise to them that do well. It is true, if I have done evil; if I meet with a Man that is but my Equal; if in buying and sell∣ing and Commerce, I have wronged him and deceived him, though he knows not of it: Yet I am affraid of him, I am fearful that he will discover me and find me out: But if I speak the Truth, and do that which is honest in the sight of all Men, I shall not fear any Man; there is no Nation under Heaven but there is a principle of Truth to be found amongst them, in the Hearts of Men: If I Act according to the principle of Truth in mine own Heart, there is the same principle of Truth in all Men. If I walk up to the principle of Truth in my self, I shall likewise walk up to the principle of Truth in all Mens Hearts; if mine own Heart doth not condemn me, all the World cannot condemn me. If professors were resolved to answer the principles of Truth in their own Hearts, and go through stitch in the profession, they might live Couragiously: Truth will Crown them with Victory. But if they do not live accord∣ing to the rule and standard of Truth, they are like Salt that have lost its savour which is trod∣den
under feet of Men. But where all are one in Truth, they are gathered into the Truth, and they will live according to it, so far as they are convinced of it: If you will give them a World they will not give away an Hairs breadth of the Truth which they have pro∣fessed; when Truth thus comes to have Do∣minion, then Truth shall overspread the Earth, and the kingdoms of the World shall become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, and righteousness shall rule, and the Scepter of it be swaied over the Nations, and they that Rebel against it shall be broken by it, and they that are found in it shall have Dominion, and they shall condemn Hypocrites and Dissemblers: Now if you would grow up into this Domini∣on, you have an opportunity for it, because the Truth is Revealed in your own Hearts. They who go about to walk in the Truth meerly from what they hear the Ministers of Truth Preach, laying up in their minds a com∣pany of Doctrines, Notions and Tenets, they will stumble and fall, but they that will heark∣en to the Truth in their own Hearts and regard the Voice of it in all their ways and undertak∣ings; these have a Minister at Home with them, they have a Chaplain in their own House; if there be any thing they know not, and if they know not what to do they ask this Minister
of the Sanctuary; others they will ask their Ministers, but your Minister is at Home with you: Where hath God appointed any Man to rule over your Consciences; no, God hath ap∣pointed Christ only to guide and govern your Consciences, to be the Author of Faith and the Finisher of it too: You that are come to to the Dispensation of the Spirit of Christ keep to the testimony in your own Hearts; then we have fellowship with one another in the Truth, and we have cause to bless God for it; that God hath so opened the Heart of one to∣wards another, that the suffering of one is the suffering of all, and the Consolation of one the comfort and rejoycing of all: But, Alas! Who is in this fellowship? Only those that are in fellowship with the Truth, in their own Heart, are really so: If a Man shall break fellow∣ship with Truth in his own Heart, he will make no bones of breaking fellowship with his Brethren: As soon as Men break fellow∣ship with Truth, they are unruly, Heady, troublesom and make no matter of splitting and tearing and rending of fellowship with others. How comes it to pass that thou hast done this? thou didst not thus whilst thou feared Sinning against the witness of God in thine own Heart. But when Men have once made Light of the great Minister of the Gospel in their own
Hearts, it is an easie matter to make light of all the rest; if, as Christ saith, They have done so to the Green Tree, no wonder that they do so to the Dry Tree; If they despise me (saith Christ) do you think they will love you? It is most evident in a great many at thi Day, they Dispute against Truth; they have taken a Liberty to speak contrary to the Truth in their own Hearts, then they cry down the Ministers of it: Do you think any body doth so that keep their first tendernes? When they were first convinced the Power of the Lord rested upon them; when the Power of God first wrought upon you and brought you to Yea, and Nay, and to plain simple Language and Habit, this was with jy and delight for Christs sake. They that keep up this tenderness and simplicity of Mind; there is no scattering, nor rending, or tearing among them, they keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, and they are kept together in one. Friends, you have an opportunity in your hands, see that you make use of it; you may bear up and not be deceived by Men or Devils, If you keep faithful to the Principle of Truth in your own Hearts. Let what Reproach and Persecution soever come, here is a Standard, a Foundation and
a Rule for you to be Governed by: Every hour of the Day, search your Hearts and try your Consciences by it. As you do this and keep to the Rule of the new Creature, of the Regeneration, being changed from a Car∣nal Birth to an Incorruptible Birth: If you he born of the Incoruptible seed; the Devil cannot corrupt you; Evil passions cannot corrupt you; if you keep upon that Foun∣dation that is Incorruptible in it self, then nothing will corrupt you, nor your ways and manners: If you will then live accord∣ing to the simplicity of the Gospel, you will serve God and be examples to others in the Life of Holiness and Righteousness, and hereby God shall be glorified. This is that which will shine forth to the whole Nation, and give a good Report to Truth: But if any that Profess the truth be found false to their Profession and be found unholy, and de∣ceive and over-reach his Neighbour, the party loseth by it, and the Devil reioyceth at it. Thus we know the Life of Righteousness is brought forth through the Spirit of Truth, and outshines all, and will reach Gods wit∣ness in them that are afar off, and bring them near; and happy and blessed are they that are found in this Divine work, conforming their Lives and Conversations according
to the new Creature: Peace be upon them, And upon the whole Israel of God: There is a Minister that abides with you, that goes home with you, it is his Testimony that you must stand or fall by: If any one should be a false Professor and be cryed up, if he be not sincere he hath not Peace, though he flutter a while and makes a shew, the Worm of guilt Gnaws him and Torments him; such as these have not Peace with God, nor fellow∣ship with the Church: Though they seem to be a live yet they are Dead, as it was with the Churches in Asia, they had a name to live, yet they were Dead; though they have an empty Name, such a one is a living Man or Woman, are esteemed Friends to the Church; but though they are commended and cryed up, and have a Name to live, yet they are Dead, there are a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their Garments, they walk with me in White, saith Christ, for they are worthy: I know thy works that thou hast a name, that thou livest and art Dead: See what Christ the Bright Morning Star could do; he could look into a Meeting and see whether few or many had only a name to Live, or were really alive, if they were Dead as to Sinceri∣ty and Truth, though they had been among the Church they would help to break it down, but not to build it up.
You that have his Divine life still stirring in you, and feel the operation that first quickened you to God; prize this principle of the Divine life above all: What is there can rob you of it? Value not the Friendship of the World: Alas! What can it Amount to? Count it as Dung in comparison of Christ Jesus, look upon all things with a sound Eye: Peace with God is of that concerment that you cannot be happy here or hereafter without it; the Friendship of the World I can be without, and the customes and fashi∣ons of the World I can be without, I can spare these things; but the Favour of God I cannot be without, and growth in Grace and the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and a sincere Profession of the Gospel, I cannot be without these things. My Friends, though you do not make a shew and Flutter in the World as some others do, yet your glory is within they that are living Members of this Divine body, the glory and beauty, and brightness of such, appears in the sight of God. If you grow in grace you will be a Comfort one to another, and as the Apostle speaks, You are our Epistle written in our Hearts knwn and read of all Men. The Lord preserve and keep you simple, keep you in all Sincerity, in that Truth that hath wrought in your own hearts, that you may have acquaintance with your teacher, that he may not be driven into corners, for you may do it and stop his mouth and silence him too. If you let your Perverse will Rule, you may slay the Just, but there will come a Day of his Rising, then down go you: Whatsoever Men may get by it at present, when Truth riseth, when the just one that was slain hath a Resurrection in them, then most certain down they go; While you have an opportunity in your Hands and an Interest in the Covenant of Life, walk with God according to the Counsel and Dictates of his Holy Spirit, that you may be brought to an heaven∣ly
Fellowship, and to partake of the Good things that God hath prepared for his Children. My Friends, Pray, prize your seasons, let no Day slip for fear you may miss a Day at last; wait upon the Lord and let his fear and a Holy awe be always upon your Hearts: Then peace will be upon you and there will be acceptance of all that you do, Mark the Perfect Man and behold the upright, for the End of that Man is peace; when he can reflect upon his past Life and say, I have walked before the Lord with a perfect Heart and done that which is good and well pleasing in his sight, and have not turned aside to the right Hand or to the left, but the standard of Truth hath been the guide of all my Spiritual and Temporal Actions. If truth hath been thy guid here, then Truth shall be thy Portion hereafter: If Truth guide thee in thy way, then thou shall rejoyce with the Saints, and receive an Inheritance with the People of God, and enjoy that glory and felicity which God hath prepared for them that Love him. His Prayer after Sermon. EVerlasting, Glorious, Eternal God of Life, whose kingdom ruleth over all; thy king∣dom is an everlasting kingdom, a Glorious and Bles∣sed Day hath dawned, wherein thou art making thy self known to the Sons and Daughter of Men, and thou hast opened an Eye in a Remnant, which the God of this World had blinded, to see the Glory of it: For though we have lived without God in the World, yet thou art near to us, and thou hast called us to Repentance, and inspired our Souls with a de∣sire to thee, and to the Remembrance of thy name. Praises and Everlastings Thanksgivings belong unto thee, who art the Author of our Salvation, who hast reached out thy Hand and laid hold upon us, and sought us out when we sought thee not, and hast made known thy Power and love for our Re∣demption
and Salvation; and thou wilt make it known more and more to every upright and sin∣cere mind: O Powerful Father of Life, how hath thy Power and Goodness been Revealed on our be∣half for thine own Name sake? Thou hast stood by us in all our Tryals and Exercises, and we have ound thee a God nigh at Hand, and thou hast brought a Remnant to desire nothing so much as the Injoyment of thy Presence; thou hast brought them to be sensible, that without thee they can do nothing; therefore in all our Assemblies and Meet∣ings we desire to be Acquainted with thy Power, to hear thy Word which speaks Life to our Souls by which we may live: And Dear and Powerful Father, the Continuation of thy goodness among us doth greatly engage the Hearts of thy Children to offer up Praises and Thanksgivings to thee; Thou hast inclined the Minds and Hearts of thy People to wait upon Thee, and hast opened their understand∣ings to receive thy Heavenly Truth, and those rich and Heavenly treasures which thou offerest them; and hast provided a Cup of Salvation to refresh the Poor and needy Soul. O Living God of Life, reach forth thy Hand, to support and save those that are Breathing after thee, that are sensible of their want of thy presence, and are frequenting the Assemblies of thy People, with ho and desire that they may enjoy a Blessing from thee. Living God of Life, Touch their Hearts with the Finger of thy Power, and let them know that thou art ready to open the Treasures of thy Love, and Life unto them, through the Lord Jesus Christ, that their Souls may be Com∣forted, and they may offer up to thee Sacrifices of Thanksgiving. And let all thy Children every where render to thy Holy Name, through Jesus Christ, Blessing and Honour and Praise; who art God over all, Blessed for ever and ever, Amen. FINIS.
