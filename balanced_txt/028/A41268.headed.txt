A PROTESTATION ATTESTED Before Anthony Luther Esquire, one of the Justices of the Peace, for the County of Essex, vpon Iune 10. 1644. As the causes why the Protesters could not heare in the publike Assemblies of the Church of England, and so joyn in worship with that Ministry. VVHereas in the second Article of the Solemn League and Covenant, taken by us for the glory of GOD, and the advancement of the Kingdom of our LORD & SAVIOVR JESVS CHRIST, and other the godly Ends there∣in expressed; We find that we swear, That we shall without respect of persons, endeavour the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy; that is, Church-government by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, their Chancellours, Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-Deacons, and all o∣ther Ecclesiasticall Officers depending on that Hierarchy; We hold our selves bound to declare, and protest, unto the whole World, That wee dare noe longer joyn unto, and communicate with, (but doe renounce and abhor) the Ministry of the Church of England, as it remains yet established, and named Parsons, Vicars, and Curates. As being Antichristian, and in their Ordination depending upon the Hierarchy, having taken priesthood one of the Orders thereof, and having been ordained by Bishops, as they were Bi∣shops, by their apish mockery of Christ, as it were giving unto them the Holy Ghost. And by their Oath of Canonicall obedience; setting up Bishops above CHRIST, who hath declared the Canons of his Church, unalterably in his Word: Yet by that Oath they stand bound to o∣bey all Canons now made, or hereafter to be made. As maintaining in their former practice, an Idolatrous will-worship of the Service and Ce∣remonies, directly contrary to the liberty purchased by the bloud of Christ, and many fem against knowledge and conscience. As great Profaners of the holy things of God, putting no difference between the precious and the vile. As guilty of the blood of many, concealing a great part of the councel of God. As living by a Jewish, Popish, and extortionous maintenance of tythes and offerings. As they, who if they renounce not their former Call, are great dividers between us & Scot∣land, being Anti-Presbyteriall, as well as Anti-christian. As they, who were never called, according to the Primitive and Apostolike examples, by the Churches election. We do therefore in the Bowels of the Lord Iesus, earnestly intreat, and beseech all those Mi∣nisters of the Church of England, that have the Spirit of Christ, that, renouncing their former calling and life, they would wait upon GOD, for a right call from him, and his people, ac∣cording to Christs Testament; that so we may communicate with them in Christian Society. And the LORD so blesse both Minister and people. Subscribed the same day by ROBERT FAGE, junior, and THOMAS REIGNOLDS: In the presence of ANTHONY LVTHER, Esquire. And the same PROTESTERS did likewise then appeal to the Honourable House of COMMONS, the High Court of Parliament; whether they ought to be compelled to goe to the Assemblies of England against their Consciences. Whereupon the Justice gave them liberty to enjoy their Consciences, and to prosecute their Appeale.
