MASTER GLYN HIS Speech in Parliament, on Wednesday the fift of Ianuary, at the Committee, sitting in Guild-Hall, concerning the breaches of the Priviled∣ges of Parliament, by breaking open the Cham∣bers, Truncks, and Studies, of the six Gen∣tlemen, upon their accusation of high Treason by his Majestie. 1641. Master Speaker, VVEe sit now upon that Grand busi∣nesse of the breaches of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, which are so many, and great, so carefully preserved, and defended, and having in for∣mer times severely punished the infringers thereof, that I had thought and conceived, that no Subject of what degree or dignity soever, would either in their own persons, or by mis-informing his Majesty, concerning the same, have presumed to have en∣trenched in the least measure upon the free Liberty, Rights, and very being of Parliaments, tending to the breach thereof. But Master Speaker, I perceive the perversenesse, and obstinate frowardnesse of di∣vers
persons in this Kingdome, in places of power, and authority, as well of the Clergy, as Layitie, are growne to that height, that they dare not only pre∣sume to instigate, and provoke His sacred Majesty, by their subtill and politicke mis-informations, but themselves in their owne persons dare attempt, if His Majesty in His royall wisedome, tender care, and affection towards his loyall subjects do refuse to do the same, to endeavour as much as in them lyes, by their malignant carriages in Petitions, and Protesta∣tions to resist the lawfull power, and undoubted Iurisdiction, both of the King, and his high Court of Parliament. Master Speaker, These men notwithstanding, they apparantly perceive that their wicked Practises, and malicious Designes, cannot take effect according to their expectation, but are rejected, and detected, as∣well by his Sacred Majesty, as his Lords and his whole Councell, dare aventure, to endeavour by cast∣ing aspersions, and spreading abroad evill reports, not onely of the Members, but of the Proceedings of the House of Commons against them, and others of their Adherents and Favourites, in their wicked and desperate actions and designes against their lawfull Soveraigne, and his Liege people. I conceive Master Speaker, did these persons, but remember the many presidents, yet extant of the just and deserved punishments inflicted by former Parliaments upon such miscreants, as witnesse the Archbishop of Yorke, the Duke of Suffolke,
Chiefe Iustice Belknap, and the rest of that conspi∣racy in the raigne of K. Richard the 2. they would have prejudicated to themselves, the like danger would follow upon them for their evill actions; Nay Master Speaker, did these men but consider with themselves, the just Iudgements of God, that have immediately lighted upon the necks of such, as have beene the Troublers of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, whereof they have beene members, as well recorded in sacred writ, as of late times in this Kingdome, yet still in fresh memory, they would have laid their hands upon their mouths and hearts, when they went about to speake or doe any thing tending to the dishonour of Almighty God, in innovating of his true Religion, corrupting the sincere Doctrine and Discipline of Christ and his Apostles, as also any thing tending to the disho∣nour and perpetuall destruction of his Royall Ma∣jesty, and however, otherwise they may pretend the fundamentall lawes and liberties of this King∣dome, the rights and priviledges of Parliaments, and the very being thereof: but surely Master Spea∣ker, they are altogether benummed and stupified, their consciences dead and seered, their lives and conversation altogether devoted to the workes of darkenesse, and impurity; their desires altogether Sensuall, Carnall, and Divelish, forgetting God, kicking and spurring with maliciousnesse against all piety and godlinesse, or else, they would never have adventured to practise such things, as it is too too manifest they have done. Master Speaker, I intend to bee briefe in that, which
I am to speake concerning the breaches of the pri∣viledges of Parliament First, to informe his Majesty of any proceedings in the House of Commons upon any businesse whatsoever, before they have concluded, finished and made ready the same, to present to his Majesty, for his Royall assent, thereupon is a breach of the priviledges of Parliament. Secondly, to mis-informe his Majesty contrary to the proceedings in Parliament, thereby to in∣cense and provoke him against the same, is a breach of priviledge of Parliament. Thirdly, to cause or procure any information or accusation to bee brought, or preferred without the knowledge or consent of the Parliament into the House, against any of the members thereof, is a breach of priviledge of Parliament. Fourthly, to apprehend any such accused, to im∣prison their persons, to cease upon their goods or estates, to prosecute and proceed against them to their triall and judgement, to condemne or execute them upon such accusation, without the consent or advice of the Parliament, is a breach of the privi∣ledges thereof. Fiftly, to endeavour to cast an evill opinion of such members accused into the hearts of His Ma∣jesties loyall Subjects, whereby they dis-affecting them, may be ready and willing to put in execution any command or warrant for their apprehension, and imprisonment, is a breach of the priviledges of Parliament. Sixtly, to come in open Parliament, for any Of∣ficer,
or Sergeant, to demand and arrest any such member accused, be it of high Treason, or any other crime whatsoever, without the knowledge of the whole House, is a breach of the priviledges of Par∣liament. Seventhly, to come to a Parliament sitting in free consultation, assisted and guarded with Armed men, and with them besetting the House, to demand as it were (vi & (armis) such members accused, is a breach of the priviledges of Parliament. Lastly, to procure to be set forth, or to set forth under His Majesties name, any Proclamation, or Declaration, prohibiting the repaire of such per∣sons accused to the Parliament, as members thereof, and to apprehend them in what place soever they shall bee found, without the advise and consent of the whole State assembled, and sitting in free Parlia∣ment, is a manifest breach of the priviledges thereof. And this Master Speaker is all that I have to say, concerning this dayes busines, humbly leaving the same to the further consideration of this Ho∣nourable Assembly. FINIS.
