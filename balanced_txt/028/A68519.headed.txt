AN Oration Militarie to all naturall Englishmen, whe∣ther Protestants, or other∣wise in Religion affected, to moue resolution in these dangerous times. VVherein is expressed the de∣light of libertie, and the ty∣rannie of the enemie. With a Praier both pithie and necessarie. Written by a zealous affected Subiect. Non nobis solùm nascimur. AT LONDON Printed by Thomas Orwin, and Thomas Cadman. 1588.
An Oration Mi∣litarie. WOrthy Coūtry∣men, whose pre∣decessors were not onely feared in Europe, but fa∣mous through all the discouered partes of the Earth: doubtfull it is not, but your harts are prepared, and your mindes as it were one fire, valiantly to resist the force of a∣ny forreyne inuasion: yet to adde flame vnto your fire, I thought good in this breefe exhortation, to animate each of you, (if it may be) to more resolution. Know then (worthy Countrymen, for why we know you are not igno∣rant, what rumors are spread of the preparation of that man of sinne, that worthlesse Priest
of Rome, against this Royall Realme) and be you assured, that whatsoeuer pretence of Iustice our aduersaries by their false A∣postles (or Seminarie Priests) shall buzze into your eares, as redresse of wrongs, reformati∣on of Religion or such like: yet if you respect your auncient li∣bertie, & consider the thraldome of your neighbours subiected to the tyranie of Spanish gouern∣ment, and the double dealing of the Popes feined holines, wey∣ing besides, that of all bondage, there is none more vile than the seruice of the vile, you will (I doubt not) resolue euery one ra∣ther on death, were it neuer so bitter, than either by perswasi∣ons of flatterie or feare, submit your selues to such, as neyther merit names of men, or are for
courtesie to be accoūted among reasonable creatures. The hea∣then men (good Christian Coū∣treymen) were so affected vnto their natiue soyle, that some of them haue entred the armies of the enemies, and aymed at the harts of their cheefe Rulers, set∣ting so light by torments, that being apprehended, they them∣selues haue burnt off the hand, whose deathfull stroke mistooke the man, their hearts desired to dispatch: some cast themselues into raging gulphes: others de∣tested life, when Countreyes li∣bertie hath bene lost: most crying out, O fortunata mers quae naturae de∣bira pro Patria potissimum est reddita. Then much more we, who are not onely bound by like loue, but by a greater bonde (euen Chri∣stian libertie) ought to set light
by life, & willingly imbrace the greatest torments that tyranny can oppose, rather than see Re∣ligion defaced, our Countrie ru∣inated, our Souereigne Prin∣cesse iniured, our wiues and vir∣gins defiled, our infants tost on pikes, and our goods the gree∣die Spaniardes spoyle. Take courage Countreymen, and if they come, resolue on victorie or death: if they come not, deter∣mine some of you to braue the cowardes at their doores. Yea more, let not anie, either En∣glish traytor, or foreyne tyrant, be named leader but of a bande against this noble Iland, or the least part of her Maiesties Do∣minions, but let his heart bloud by some deuice or other, satisfie for an attempt so iniurious. Set before your eyes the de∣solation
of the Lowe Countrie, whose people flourished within these thirtie yeres, no Nation in more felicitie:but fince the Spa∣niardes haue opprest their go∣uernment, no men so miserable. Of their affliction, it is needlesse to speake, for that your eyes are witnesses of their exiled num∣bers, your eares haue heard of the mercilesse massacres among them, and the whole worlde re∣porteth ye wretchednesse of their defaced Cities, and desolate ha∣bitations. But some may say to me, seeing the Pope is Patrone of this hallowed armie, there shal be mercie shewed to the sub∣misse, and reward to such as re∣sist not (for thus his fauourers will report of him): but bee not you deceiued Countreymen, to you I now speake that haue af∣fected
our Antichristian enemy, the elder brother to Mahomet, by whose pride the yonger grew to such pompe, learne nowe at last to discerne him by his deedes. His pride O Countreymen, lost all Asia, Syria, Arabia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Aegypt, Africa, a great part of Europe, as Thracia, Constan∣tinople, all Greece, almost all Hunga∣rie, Epyrus, Illyria, a great part of Austria, with those famous Iles of Rhodes and Candie, and infinite other Regions, nowe subiect to Turkish tyrannie: yea, he that will needes bee called high Bi∣shop of Christendome, hath be∣trayed these Christian King∣domes, and yet ceaseth not by like dissension, to lay open this little remnant for the Turkish inuasion. His mercie & the mer∣cie of his adherents, is like that
which Mustapha his spiritual bro∣ther shewed, whē Famogosta was deliuered by ye Prince of Cyprus, who forced through long famin to compound, couenanted soul∣dier like he and his people should depart with bag and baggage: but most faithlessely when they were issued, after manie vile re∣proches, they stript the Prince, and with hotte pincers blistered his bodie, thrusting wier into e∣uerie blister, & being dead with famine and this torment, they bowelled and stufte him full of strawe, & on their greatest gal∣leyes mast, (whereinto his soul∣diers were thrust for slaues,) they hanged ye martyred Prince to augment his seruants mise∣rie: such mercie as the Spani∣ards shewed to the Portugalls in Tercera, who were al without
respect of age or innocence, put either to tormenting deaths, or condemned to the Gallyes, yet were they of the same religiō as their enimies, both subiect to the Sea of Rome: such mercie as the silly Indians finde, whō the Spa∣niards haue bayted with dogs, throwen to wilde beasts, & but∣chered by hundreds, as their owne Writers report: therfore it is euidēt that they regard not Religion, but seeke for Englands ruine, wherefore beleeue them not: but remember the resoluti∣on of Lewys the French Kinges sonne, discouered to the English Gentlemen cōfederates against their naturall Prince King Iohn, by a noble man of France a coun∣seller to the said Lewys, beeing in London at the point of death: and for that it is so excellent an ex∣ample
in these times, & the pre∣tence of the English rebellious was to defend the Papal digni∣tie, I thinke good breefely to note the effect of his admoniti∣on: My Lords (saith he) and Gentle∣men of England, I am in conscience moo∣ued, my houre of death approching, to warne you of imminent danger that han∣geth ouer your heads: You see that my Lord the Prince Lewys through your as∣sistance, hath gained many forces in this Realme of England: and if you were not blinded with too much malice, you might easily perceiue what he intendeth toward you, in that he makes French men rulers ouer those holdes: but to assure you bet∣ter of his intent, I protest vpon my soule, which must shortly answere, if I speake vntruth, that before euer we left Paris, it was agreed, that not one of you which assisted him against your Souereigne, but should hane the reward of traytors when
he was possessed of the crowne. Remē∣ber this good Coūtreymen, and trust not strangers, beleeue not the secret messengers from Rome, but be ye all of one minde in the defence of England, least enuie let in the enemie, who will neither spare the enuious, nor the enui∣ed: therefore let factious men be hated as your deadliest ene∣mies, & count him happie which hasts his ende yt muttereth dis∣sention in your cares. Lastly, noble Englishmen, that abhorre the dregs of Poperie, or at least haue not at all tasted thereof, consider the olde Principle, Nul∣la fides cum haereticis obseruanda, and for heretikes hee accounteth vs, wherefore wee ought neither to beleeue him nor his. This point the Pope hath so obserued, that hee hath made the sonne breake
faith with ye father, ye wife with the husband, as lately in France, the subiect with the Prince, as England can too wel witnesse, yea by Ambassadors, which is ab∣hominable amōg heathen men, hath the Pope and Spaine practi∣sed treason, as lately by Mendoz∣za with Francis Throckmorton euen in London. O Countrimen, detest these infidels, thinke on your goods, your lands, parēts, chil∣dren, wiues, Prince, Countrie, and Religion, for which to die is euen the waye to life. without which to liue is worse than anie death: and trust in God that gi∣ueth victorie, to whose righte∣ousnes if we cleaue, and consent in vnitie, our enemies shall be of no force, who are only feared be∣cause they are cruell, and neuer winne victorie but by treason. FINIS.
❧ The Praier. ALmightie & Eternal God, that disposest of all Nations at thy pleasure, & hast alwayes from the worldes foundation, shewen forth thy wonders in deliuering thy elect, e∣uen from the very doore of death; as Noah from the olde rebellious, Lot from Sodom, Iacob from Esau, Israel frō Aegypt, Dauid from Saul, and Ezekiah from Zenacherib: all these thy chil∣dren, (O mightie God of hostes) had mightie worldlings to their enemies: but for their faith was fixed in thy righteousnes, the armies nor enuie of their aduersaries could preuail against thē: for, with the breath of thy mouth were they consumed; & to their shame were they cōfounded. Thou wert one God from the beginning, thou art the same, & wilt be euer one; which makes vs wretched sinners, (not withstanding the number of our misdeedes, excee∣ding the Starres in Heauen, or fandes of the Sea) to prostrate our selues be∣fore thy throne of Maiesty, beseeching
mercy and thy omnipotent assistance. We haue sinned ô Lord, we haue gone astray, be mercifull, ô God be merci∣full to our offences, and for thy owne name sake, looke downe vpō thy small flocke, thy little Church of England, against whom whole armies of Rabsha∣kehs are sent to rayle, Zenacherib him∣selfe blaspheming, and practising in Babylon our ruine: & to him are ioy∣ned the greatest nations. Against thee & thine anoynted Elizabeth haue they conspired; against thee and thine in∣heritance of England haue they bent their power; they haue sworne to re∣nue their olde abhominations; and make thy sanctuarie among vs deso∣late: being in number as the dust of the earth. But O God of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob and their righteous seede, in whose sight the Maiestie of men is miserable, and their proudest numbers as the fearefull Hinde: stretch forth thy arme, & fight for vs ô Lord; poure foorth thy spirite on our honorable & aged men, on our youthfull and vali∣ant men, that the one with counsell a∣greeable to thy will, may stirre vp the
courage of the other to fight thy bat∣tels, that the foes of England, (enemies to thy Almightinesse) may be as chaffe tossed with the winde. Increase in vs charitie, confirme our faith, defend our Souereigne, continue thy Gospell mongst vs, that thou maist be glorified for euer in this Realme of England. Grant these deare Father and al other our necessities, euen for thy sonne our Sauiour Iesus sake. Amen.
