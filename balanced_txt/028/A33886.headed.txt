Raree Show Or the true Protestant Procession. A new Ballad to the Tune of the Northumberland man. 1. THis is the Cabal of some Protstant Lords A forging the turne that not long since they had, Here W— sitteth and searcheth Records▪ to find Flaws in good Statutes, & varnish the bad. 2. This is the Lord Tony that slyly sits here Who to sham and contrive has never deny'd And rather then the Good Cause shou'd fall through his fear He'l let out Rebellion by broaching his side. 3. This is Popular Perkin that smirks and looks gay The women extols the Spark up to the sky, None danceth with so great a grace, as they say, Yet some body thinks that he capers too high. 4. Here flourishing E— the tongue o'th Gang VVith Rhetorical Artifice fancies fine things, First vainly composeth a taking Harangue then fosters a Villain in Libelling Kings. 5. Here's Docter Informant that ne'r wou'd stick out To traffick in Oaths or tell a State-Lye, Observe how he firks all the Jesuits about, First blaws on a Beuk, and so Papists God b—y. 6. Here's Wilmore thats troubl'd with scruples & stings His Citizens conscience is nice and demure, A Traytor's Indicted for treasonable things, But he tells you tis false, he's a Protestant sure. 7. These are some sage Cytizens that you see there, VVho out of their Zeal all our rights to maintain And to keep out all slavery, have taken a care to put up in the streets two Posts and a Chain.
8. The seare some Apprentices that still do retain Some Tenets their Masters approve and allows, They come to direct a wise Monarch to Reign Instead of sweeping their shop and cleaning of shooes. 9. This is the Committee where greivance is scann'd Which Remonstrates the danger that threatens the State Good service is here by suspicion Trapan'd And Allegiance is reckon'd Malignancy streight. 10. Her's the Synod of Saints that will sometimes refresh The failings of nature with means of their own. They'l preach you the mortification of flesh With eyes up to Heaven and Breeches let down. 11. These are the Cabal of the Covenantiers That think they maintain the Religion the best By pulling down Churches and their Overseers And routing the Defender of Faith with the rest. 12. These are the Remains of the Levelling Rump That stink in the House and fresh Commons annoy, And least the right James shou'd be turn'd up for Trump They cry out, a Court Card will their gaming destroy. 13. That Lumber of Trumpery buzzing about Are silly Subscribers that come at first dash, To make up a large Petitioning rout Of Link-boys and all such true Protestant trash. 14. These there are the Hucksters that Treason retail, They'l sell you a sheet with a penniworth in't; That's Courantier Care that never will fail to scribble, whilst Langly dares Publish and Print. 15. That's the Club of a Pack of ingenious friends that made Charles a Scotch Pedlar in the Rare show, And I hope that our Monarch to make them amends will give them a Yard of St. Johnstons or two, Printed for A. B. 1681.
