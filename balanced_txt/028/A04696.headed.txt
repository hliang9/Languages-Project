The exposicion of Daniel the Prophete gathered oute of Philip Melanchton / Iohan Eco∣lampadius / Chonrade Pellicane & out of Iohan Draconite. &c. By George Ioye. A Pro∣phecye diligently to be noted of al Em∣prowrs & kinges in these laste dayes. And nowe ye kinges get ye vnderstan∣ding & knowlege / be ye taught & lerned in Gods worde / ye iuges of the erthe. Psal. 2. Serueye the lorde in feare / kisse ye the sonne (and not images) lest he bewrathe and ye perisshe from the way / for shortely shal his anger be kindled. But then bles∣led be thei all that truste vnto him. 1545. In Auguste.
☞ ☞ Unto the most cleare Prince / lorde Maurice Du¦ke of Saxone / Lantgraue of Turinge and Marchis of Misne: Phi∣lip Melanchton whis∣sheth helthe. WHen I addressed me to write this exposicion vpon Daniel / I remenbred the halcyons dayes. For thei saye that in the most sharpHalcyon is a kin∣gis fis∣sher. and coldest tyme of the yere / these halci∣ons making their nestisin the sea rockis or sandis / wil sitte their egges and hat∣cheforth their chikens. And therfore the same sea that harboureth these fowles thus sitting vpon their egges / wil be so cawme and still to her geistis for. 14. day∣es / that men may sewerly sayl without perel vpon her / not shaken nor molested with any storme or tempeste / nor yet the nestis of theis birdes so nighe the water not once shaken nor hurt with any sour∣ges. For the seas wil not for that tyme of these birdis sitting and hatching /  her geistis. And therfore is this tran∣quilite of the sea for that litle tyme / as a
rwce taking in the winter / called the hal¦cions dayes. But nowe to my purpose. As God hathe setforth in natural creatures many images & faces of his chirche / euē so vnto me reading the hole descripcion of these birdes / it hathe ben oftyn put in mynde of ye chirche yet nesteling in theis troublouse colde dayes / as it were in the sea / that is, in great troublouse empyres and kyngdoms. In whiche for a certaine litle ceason / god hath geuē bothe howse / as were a neste / and also some trāqui∣lite vnto godly studies / that the gospel might be preached / red herd / and for. 14. days rested vpō / for some chosen chykēs and faithful birdis of Cryst there to be forth hatched and fethered. Siche halci∣on dayes had the ews for that litle tyme whylis Ioan Bapt. preached / and whyls Cryst and his apostles taught & preched them penance & the kingdom of heuen to be at hande. For except / for some litle ceason there had ben peace and reste / ne∣ther might the voice of the gospell haue had bē spred a¦brode nor ye yougth taught ād brought vp therein / norany company gathered into any chirche. Which thigs to be done it is not possible / whyles by the terrible troublouse rustling toharnes and batail / and for the barberouse fyerce
furye of these soldyers / honeste societies ād congregacions be scatered / godly pre∣ching cessed / cyties & townes ouerthrone and brēt / no scoles holden / or place quiet for childern and ignorant persons to be taught. Namely when the babes be plukt from their mothers bosoms / and laddes out of their fathers handes to be slayne. These thingis whē ye se done / thē let vs lament & a knowelege the wrath of God powered forth ayenst the synnes of man∣kinde. But yet the immense mercy and goodnes of God / at some certain ceason geueth a litle breathing space to his chir∣che / making the fyerce seas cawme for a litle tyme, leste thei shuld let the halciōs to hatcheforthe their chikēs. For becau∣se therfore / that God hathe geuen vs in this region a litle quyetnes / as it were the halcions. 14. dayes reste / whiles the gospel might shyne forthe: let vs render to him thankis / and withe very godly prayers aske tranquilite & peace, that na∣mely ye youghth might be godly brought vp & taught: and also that honest & god∣ly gouerners and techers might gouerne and defende the disciplyne. For al be it great difficulties and many sharp stor∣mes haue euermore grated vpō the chir∣che to excercise hir faithe / yet do experi∣ence
shew vs / & God afore did speke it, The last olde age of the worlde to be mi∣cheThe last dayes be {per}ellous. more miserable ād sorowful then the former ages. Nether / trwly / be these pre∣dicciōs ād prophecies setforth in vaine. For God wold haue them read, that the godly hertes might prepare them selues vnto the manyfold perels ād batails / ler∣ne whiche is the very chirche of God / in whiche the voice of the gospel of the sone of god sown / thei might knowe that same to be the chirche which shal fight with the ennemies of cryst / which by his death hath for vs apeaced the wrath of the eternal father / and now rysen raig∣neth to glorifie his chirche with lyfe euer∣lasting. Thei mought knowe that these sorowful miserable calamitis shall haue an ende / euen then / when the chirche ste∣red vp ayene from dethe shal be beutifyed with glori euerlasting. Of theise thingis forasmiche as God himself very largely premonissheth vs in this boke writen of Daniel / and hath constituted euen the ordir of the tymes and ages / apointing in a maner the very limites ād bowndes of the world / sewerly the reading of this boke must nedis be profitable to goodCap. 12. men. Also the aungel himself in the ende of this boke exhorteth this laste age to
this lesson where he saith. Daniel thou shalt stonde in thy course or lotte into the ende / that is. Thou shalt do this office. Thou shalt teche and confirme the god∣ly. And cryst himself doth not onely dedu¦ce vs vnto the reading of this boke / but also commandeth vs attentyuely to con∣syder of how waighty and great thinges Daniels prophecye techeth vs / saying / whoso read it / let him take hede / whiche saying gretely moueth vs to reade this boke the gladlyer with the more diligen∣ce. Besydis this / it is ye very breif cōpen∣dious some and reherceall of the storyeA monar¦chie is o∣ne empi∣re ouer all the worlde. of the hole worlde / euen from the firste monarchye to the laste / setting befor our eyes the cleare examples of the good ād euilprinces and rulers. Of the profite of this boke / it shalbe spoken more here aftir. But to inuyte all men vnto the reading of Daniel / I haue added breif notes. For the sayingis of the prophets be so plentuouse that thet cannot be all at once out drawne. Wher∣fore al be it these my bare and sclender cō¦mentaris be not able to satisfie the am∣plitude of ye mater / yet it profiteth to put men in minde of the cheif maters / and as it were with my fynger to point them to those places which the diligent readers
being studiouse / may by their owne medi∣tacion afterward turne to / & behold them nyerer. There be verely in Daniel many stories which require an interpretor. And in these / I think my labour to profire the yougth. Whiche my labours I permitte to the iugement of the godly and lerned / which shal iuge of this my boke both ient∣ly and louingly. And because it is comō∣ly vsed to dedicate bokis to princes and rulers / which vsage may haue many pro¦bable and graue causes, My mynde is to dedicate vnto you (most noble prīce) this my labour and litle boke / that when I hear your good will towerd the chirche of cryste and to honeste studies, to be pray¦sed / I wolde therfore declare also this your vertewe vnto the students / exhor∣ting them to loue ād reuerēce godly prin∣ces / and in their praiers commende them with their comons vnto God. Great is the infirmite of man / greter is the fury of the deuil / which brening in the hatered of god / as he thrusted out our first parēts to fall into these miserable sorouful cala∣mities / euen so studieth he perpetually to hurte Crystes chirch. And cheifly he lay∣eth awaite at the higheste head therof / & of our lyfe: nether is there any so great wi∣sedom which can wel perceyue howe gre∣at
perel there is in euery gouernance and regiment. Wherfore all princes conioined vnto the chirche of God / ought with the prai∣ers of all faithful to be holpen / that God whiche geueth helthe vnto kings wold once rule their counsess and bowe their myndes & their enforcements vnto their owne and to the publik sauing helthe. Of this thig the readers shuld be monisshed in this kinde of dedicacions. For the re∣ding of noble and clear examples / shuld exhort the same princes thēselues vnto modesty moderaciō / & to pyte / not to slaye ohō so euer the aduersaries of god wold haue killed / but to fere God. Which ex∣amples / for this ende hath God set befor their eyes / to call them and their posteri∣te to the study and scole of vertew. I ther fore besech God hertely the father of Ie su Cryste our delyuerer to preserue you / & so to gouern you / that your gouernance be happye & prosperouse to you / to your countrye / & to the chirche of cryste / euen the very trewe comonal∣tie of all. So be it. In the Calends of Ianuary. 1545. transla∣ted.
☞ The argument or mater con∣tained in Daniel the Prophete by Philip Melanchton. MAny myghty and profitable thigis wor∣thie to be depely repo∣sed into good myndis Daniel comprehēdeth whyche all to peruse and expresse / owr to skantlitle witts be not able. Netheles let euery diligent reder knowe hymselfe miche to haue profited / if he but the cheif prinipalls vnderstand / although it be but meanly: and vse the same vnto hys own godly exercise: Considering which part techeth him the trewe inuocation and worship of god and which cōfirmeth his faith / which rēiecteth and refuteth the iewes, and vs castinge away god and his gospel as thei did: which parte pre∣cheth to vs repentance / and which euen nowe monissheth and warneth vs in ty∣me, of these laste perellous dayes & blody ende of this worlde. For these causes shall I recite breifly / as it wer the titles herein contained, whiche shal shew you what vtilite shall come to you by reding
thys holy boke and diuyne Prophete. Firste think you thus of the hole boke. That the story of Daniel is a testimony of the preseruacion of the chirche beuti∣fied  with great glory / euen then when it semeth almost extincte and destroid. It techeth vs therfor the chirche bothe to be chastised and skourged / ād anon aftir hir crosse / to be restored to glori. It testifieth also the chirche / not by manis counsel / powre / strength / ordināces / noractis / but by the sin helpe of god / euen from the begining to this daye / to be defended, pre∣serued and encreaced. It putteth vs also in mynd of the promises of god to be per∣formed to hys chirche / although it be done aftir a nother waye then we can conceiue. As when it was promised to the tribe of Iuda, The scepter nor tea∣cher to be taken awaye from it vntil that sauiour Sylo come: wher of the kinges of Iuda were so bolde / that they so oft re∣belling / moste proudly and cruelly they resisted and dampned the prechinge of Ieremye concerninge the destruccion of their cite temple / and kingdom. As wold nowe men resiste and destroye him that shuld preache to emprours and to kinges saing. Excepte ye repent and receiue the gospell nowe offred you / the turke shall
destroye all cristēdom. But Ieremy knew full wll these thinges bothe to come to passe / that the peple of god shuld be cha∣stised by an haithen king / and yet at that tyme / nether the regale famylie nor the stok of Iuda to be extincted nor the trwe prophets to fayle & bwanted. And euen so it came to passe beyond al menis ex∣pectaciō / when fewe or non knew therof. For the kingly stok euē in the babylon captiuite had their honor / where god stered vp prophets and orned his chirche with great glory, yea and euen the hai∣then gentiles did he adioyne vnto the felowship of his owne chirche / so that there was then a gloriouse conuersion of the haithen vnto God / as I praye God there may be of the turkes and iewes on∣ce vnto owr trewe cristen religion. Secondarily ye shal obserue the testi∣monis of Messias owr king Cryste. For  as the other prophets were cheifly stered vp that by them the promises of Cryste shuld be spred the wyder / euen so it be∣houed Daniel to do the same office: and that bi many wais / and in many visions. For he prohecyed of his birth telling the yere and tyme therof / and of his passion a certenly and iustely the very tyme, as did Iohan Baptist poynt himforth withe
his finger / euen whyles yet the comon∣weale of the iews shuld en, Cryste shuld be borne and suffer / and also when their ceremoniall shawdews & sacrifices all shuld ceasse. Thirdely ye shal note the order / of the. 4. Monarchies / which order is here ex∣pressed / that the very tyme wherin god wold haue cryste borne shuld be knowne / and the tyme of the general resureccion of the dead / and the iugement shulde be signifyed and foresene. So that Daniel prophecieth certainly of these troublouse laste blodye dayes and persecucion nowe of late begunne; which all / Cryste with his laste coming now at hād, shall of. Fowerthly ye shal note the places of repentance / of faithe / and of the iustifi∣cacion  by faith onely. Fyftely / ye shall note the examples of good and euil kingis. Sixtely consydere the testimonie of  the resurreccion. Seuenthly there is geuē v a forwar∣ning  of the vngodly kingdoms / which aboute the ende of the worlde shall  enforce and contēde to quenche and put away the gospel of god. And here is de∣scribed the sorowful lamētable cruel sca∣teringe of the pore prechers and profes∣sours
of Crystes verite / and the persecu∣tion of the chirche dispersed ād vanished into sondry strange londis, porely there liuing, vnder kinges em and rulers, which, wyth cruelty defende idollatry, supersticion and false religion. And in so great confusion emong sondry nacions / sondry sectis shall aryse bolstred vp by manis witte & reason, concerninge gods worship, inuented by man and the iusti∣ficacion by workis &c. Agenst which pro∣phane fantasies and idle imaginacions we must lern in the gospel / god to be wor∣shiped in spirit / and faith onely in cryst to iustifye. Ayenst the epicures that de∣nye the resurreccion / and soules to be im∣mortal / here we haue a cleare testimonye of the resuscitation of the dead to come, where the vngodly shalbe punysshed with payns perpetuall / and the godly endewed with ioye eternall. The profes∣sours of this doctryne shal aryse ayen vnto lyfe. By the doctrine of cryste / of the prophets / and apostles, professed and receyued / the trwe chirche is  from the Synagog of anticryst. Here it is taught also the chirche not to be the most multitude / but often to be but a litle miserable sorte afflic with pouerty, pre∣sos, and persecucion with many other ca∣lamities
/ and the wyked enimies of god for the more parte to bere rule / to be em∣prours and kinges, popes, cardinals, bis∣shops &c. And to haue the wealthy vayn glorye of this worlde. But when these vtwarde apperances offende manis rea∣son / which being ignorant of the wrathe of God ayenst synne / yet cleauing in the nature of man / dreameth these rulers ra∣ther to be beloued of God to whom he ge∣ueth victory / impery, riches, & rule: ther∣fore it is necessarye to note this premoni cion, teaching vs how we shulde knowe the chirche of God / where we shuld seke it / euen onely in that cōgregacion which receiueth & enbraceth with perel of their lyues the doctryne delyuered by the pro∣phets / by Cryste & his apostles. And let not the  / kinges / rulers nor ry∣ches nor their gloriouse titles / nor the multitude / nor longe customs / nor the ho∣ly names of their holy mother the chir∣che moue the to esteme them for the pe∣ple of god, whiche ether castaway / negle∣cte or  the vniuersal doctrine of the prophets and apostles / orels openly and pertinatly defende imagis, superstici∣on vaine ryts / idle ceremonies, and Pa∣pistrye. Here also thou seeste the anticry∣stis bothe seculare and spirituall prophe∣cied
to come in the second & third but es∣pecially in this last Monarchie / whe∣re in thei shall moste cruelly towerds the ende of the worlde greuously persecute & resiste the gospell / here (I say) ar these aduersaries to crist lyuely setforth ī their own colors and as it were with Daniels finger pointed forthe: & also / howe / whe∣rewithe / and when thei shalbe destroid. Men must be prudent in diuiding and re∣ceiuing the prophets documents. Thei must loke whiche parte containeth the laws / whiche preche the promises & the gospell. For vnto these principalls allo∣ther things muste be referred. Note also whiche parte declareth the documents. As what can be said clerelyer and euidēt∣sier ayenst the iews / then that Daniel af firmeth cryste to must haue had ben bor∣ne during yet the comō weal of Moses? Wherfore that horrible destrucciō of hie∣rusalem and ruyne of the hole londe of Iuda nowe paste. 1474. yeres / do testify cryste to be borne / & it refuteth their mad∣de and cursed pertinacye. Here must we note the lessons of the trwe inuocacion & worship of God. As whē Daniel prayeth / he aknowlegeth to God onely his owne and their synnes for whom he prayeth / & asketh of God onely delyuerance in the
faith and confidence of his mercye / ad∣ding by expresse name, For the lorde cry∣ste his sake / that is for Messias his sake promised. This forme of prayer with con∣fidence of the mercy of God promised for crystes sake / we ought to vse in these last and perlous days: now be we taught who be the chirche and therwith monisshed to flye and ▪ that false coloured cō∣pany that contende to blot out the name and glory of cryste / defende their images supersticiouse rites, cere. and papistry ay∣enst the gospel / vnder the name of the chirche or of any other begged glitering gay titles. Nether ought this thing to be negle∣cted / that to confirme our myndis / Godthe scri∣pture is Gods worde. hathe geuen vs prophecies of all sortes concerning the externe kingdōs / so that by the iust fulfilling of euery thing / as it was prophecied / we haue trwe testimo∣nys that owr scripture is Gods worde / & no nother but this owr faithe, to be the trwe faithe also. And that we shuld be warned and tolde when cryste shal come and whē we must loke for the ende of the worlde. And when we see althingis to haue had come to passe / and be fulfilled whiche were prophecied / then we shuld beleue euen these same also to be lykewy∣se
fulfilled whiche yet this daye the scri∣ptures testifie to come orels we se them presente. Whiche prophecies the clre∣syer to be vnderstandē / it is necessary we know the ages of the worlde and the or∣der of the. 4. Monarchies / and the nowm∣ber of the tymes howlong thei stode. A brife supputacion of the Ages and yeris of the worlde. FOr the beter vnderstanding of this prophete / I will diuyde the worlde / as saith the house of Elie / into. 3. a∣ges: and then aftir Daniels storye into. 4. Monarchies. The house of Elie thus saith. Six thousand yeris shal the world stande / and aftir that it shall fall and be destroi Two thousand yeris it shall stand vn der the lawe vnwriten / called the lawe ofthe first age. nature▪ writen from the begining in me∣nis hertis.

Cryste was borne in the yere from the creacion of the worl∣de. 3978. and preuēted the ende of the fow∣erth millenarie by. 22. yeris. And why? verely because we shuld know that as he hathe with his firste coming into flesshe preuented the ende of the seconde age / euen so will he with his laste coming to iugement preuent the ende of the last age and sixt millenarie. This third age in3. age. this laste. 2000. begane at the birthe or rather aftir the ascension of Cryste and shal continw vnto the destruction of the worlde at crystis coming to iugemēt. Of this age there be past this daye from the birth of cryste. 1545. and from his passion 1512. and from the final destruccion of Ie∣rusalem and the iews comon weal 1474-And thus is the world old. 5523. or aftir a nother manis rekening. 5528. Which re∣kening
is thus gathered in the bible. First from the creacion to Nohes floude there were yeres. 1656. From thence to Abrahams going forthe out of chaldei. 363. From thence to the going forth of the Is∣raefits out of Aegipte. 430. From thence to the first building of the temple in the. 4. yere of Salomons raig∣ne. 480. yeris. Frō thence to the captiuite in babilō. 429 The captiuite dured. 70. yeris. And here was the age of the worlde. 3428. yeris. From the captiuite to crystis birth. 550. yeris. & here was ye age of the world. 3978. From crystis birthe vnto this yere there be. 1545. And thus haue we the age of the world from the creacion. 5523. But because onely Daniel prophecieth of the. 4. highe Monarchies of the world and how cruelly crystis chirche shuld be persecuted vnder euery one of them / and how it shalbe treated vnder this last mo∣narchie of the Romans to ye worldis ende ye shal first know that a Monarchie is an empire or kingdome wherin all the gouerA monar¦chie. nance dependeth of one man / albeit the same hath vnder him many kings & prin∣ces. So that a monarchie is the sole head imperye ouer all the world. The first mo∣narchie

OF God / 3. in persons and one inThe ar∣gument. substance / we beginne this expo∣sicion, for that according to his threatenings & comminacions he hath by Nebucadne kyng of Babylon / as∣mightlyThe om nipoten∣cie & mer cie of God. destroyd the kingdō of the iews for breking his. 10. cōmandemēts: & age∣ne so mercifully acordig to his promises he preserued Daniel wt his felows ende∣owring al wais to kepe his preceptes. In this glasse we behold god both almi∣ghtie & merciful by kiges & prophets so to gouerne yt worlde / that thei wc wil not be∣leue the prophets and trwe prechers (as did the iewes contēpne Ieremye) must wt out mercye be destroid by the kinges and at laste by the turke acording to his thre∣atenings in the lawe: but thei that bele∣ueGod ru∣leth the world by kinges & prophe∣tis. his prophets (as did Daniel and his felows, beleue Ieremie) shalbe merciful∣ly preserued by the kiges & euē vnder the turke to / according to his promises. Let vs therfor beleue the doctryne of the pro∣phets and prechers, preching the lawe & gospel / lest with the edged swerde of the kinges and turke the seruants and ministres of God / we b'e slayne with the vngodly iewes / but rather contend by faithe to be conserued with Daniel acor∣ding to Gods promises. He cannot lve
which saith / I am the strong and zelouse God, the visitour and seker out of the wy∣kednes of the fathers in their childern, vnto the thirde and fowerth generacion. But yet am I merciful into thousandis that loue me and kepe my preceptis. In this Chapter / it is shewed howe that Daniel with his felows taken in ba∣tail, were brought into the kigs courte of Babylon / and there liberally brought vp, so that thei became very apte and able to gouerne the comon weal: whiche story cō∣teineth first a clere example of the diuy∣ne prouidence, and then an example of the holy and liberall educacion of yonge men. The first Chapter. In the thirde yere of the raigne of Ioachim kinge of the iewes / Nebucha∣dne ▪ kinge of Babylon came to Hie∣rusalem and besieged it. And the lorde yilded vp Ioachim king of the iewes into his handis and also certain of the vessels and iewels of the house of god, whiche he carying awaye with him in∣to the londe of Babylon into the howse of his god / did sette them vp in the tre∣sure howse of his God. The first place contayneth the wrath of god and punisshement of wykednes
vngodlines according to the comminaci∣ons of god / begin at the examples of the wrathe of God / that is / at the gre∣uouse calamite and miserable captiuite of the kinge & his subiectes / the destruc∣cion of their cheif cite Hierusalem / bur∣ning of their noble temple for their idol∣latry and breking of his preceptis, which miserable calamitouse captiuite and de∣adly desolacion ar described in the. 4. of the kingis. 24. cap. and in the laste of the cronicles called Paralipomenon. Hither∣to therfore tendeth the hole storye of Da∣niel.note this wel good reader. That as the iewes with their comō well, were so miserably destroyd and led into captiuite by gods minister Nebucad ne kynge of Babylon for despysing the preching of Ieremye, and slaying his pro∣phets, teaching them the law and gospel ād warning them of that their pla ge to come ouer them: euen so shal al the crysten realmes at laste for thrusting a∣waye the gospell offred them and sleying the trwe pechers sent them of God / be ly∣kewyse miserably destroied and captuied of the turke: so that firste by mutuall and ciuill batails emong themselues one de∣stroing other / thei make the waye more easy and redy for the turke to inuade and ouercome all cristendome. And wherfore
shal God do thus to his peple? Because22. Cap. (saith Ieremye) thei haue casten vp the couenant of their owne God and worshi∣ped strange Gods. Vnto the which sentē∣ce Daniel subscribeth saying / we haue9. Cap. not obayed the prophets, the seruants of God. In the londe of Sennaar / that is inGene. 7. Of baby¦lon citie. the lōde of ye caldes / in a great playn was Babylō builded in processe of tyme migh∣tely and strongly augmented with riche palaces, pleasaunt howses / strōg walles, and towers called the head cyte and em∣pyre of all the worlde so celebrated, and standyng inuicte with many gloriouse victories by the space of. 1495. yeres / ha∣uing the hole world vnder their domini∣on.

Then came kynge Cyrus and layd siege to Babylon / he digged vp the bankes of euphrates and turned the flowd clene from the cite / so that with out perell he might with his hoste entre it / and then hauing the kinge of Babylon in siche drō∣kenes and securite he slewe him and toke the cite. In that cite yet (as it is left) the∣re remaineth the temple of Iupiters ima∣ge, called Bele the fynder of the syderall science / orls is there no nother memori∣allAmoni∣cion or skant any vestigie thereof.

Nowe let vs breifly towche & declare the places of this first chapter. The first place contayneth the payne and punissh∣ment  of vngodlines / euen the greuouse captiuite & calamite of the iews for their idolatry and transgression. God meruelously performeth his pro∣mises / and  conserueth his chirche / euen then whan he punissheth the vngodly. Unto these two places pertaine all Ie∣temyes sermons in the. 22. chap. prophe∣cying

Also of Ioiakim he∣re mencioned he said he shuld be buried lyke an asse / casten out of ye gatis of Ieru∣salem. Let vs therfore fere the iugemēts and wrathe of God and abhorre vngodly worshipings and other greuouse blasphe∣mouse crymes. For if god spared not thatRom. 11. peple to whom he gaue so excellēt giftis and ample promises / miche lesse shal he spare vs. The promises were meruelous∣ly performed of God in preseruinge his own faitheful as Daniel with his felows aboue manis expectacion. And ayen the wiked greuously punisshed according to Gods comminacions in thelawe. And therfore Ieremie rebuketh the fonde vay∣ne hope of the vngodly whiche so wrested the promises vnto this ende / that thei de∣nyed any siche plages to come ouer them saying: tiuste not in these lying prophets sermons / saying we haue the temple / the temple of the lorde so holy &c.

of this firste chapter / kinges be taught to moderate their victoryes / and not vtter∣ly to desīroie all / but to constitute a beter order setting all thinges in a beter state / preseruing the good and lerned men / as did Nebuccadne preserue Ieremy ād the king with the most multitude of the peple. Hitherto pertaineth the precept of clemencye and mercy for kinges / which is to do well to the good men decerning the good and lerned from the euil & vn∣lerned / & to moderate the punisshements of the tractable and curable / and to sup∣presse the obstinate vncurable.

Here is Nebuchadne  dreameThe ar∣gnmēt of the 2. ca. declared / whiche Daniel interpre∣teth of the. 4. Monarchies which shalbe destroid at the coming of crystes kingdome. IN this chapter God conforteth his captiued iewes / and ensructeth the king vnto the kingdom of heuen. He cōforteth thē in that he glorifieth Dani∣el shewing Messias to come in / and aftir the fowerth Monarchie. He enstructeth the king in that he confoundeth his wyse men, the preistis, and dreame tellers in de claring cryste to pertaine vnto the gen∣tiles / but so that firste / the wysedō of tho∣se worldely polityk preistis be proued all folisshnes. In the secōde yere of Nebucadnezar / Text. he himself sawe a dreame / whereby his spirit gretely afraid / he awaked. Then he called togither his astronimers, encha unters▪ and the sothe sayers in all caldye to tell him and interprete his dreame &c. Nowe God reueleth in an ordir the. 4 Monarchis / witnessing that in the ende  of the worlde the euerlasting kingdom of the faithful which trwly haue worshiped and feared God / shal come vnto them. In this reuelacion is there first of all /
consolacion and a doctrine set before the peple / for they dyd now se themselues not forsaken of God in that they had so∣che Prophets as was Daniel one. They lerned also when that perpetuall glorye promised to theyr fathers / shuld be loked fore. Bsydis this / the kynge and many other gentyles by this doctryne / were monisshed to know the very God and to enbrace the trwe religion and worde of God. Secondarily this chap. containeth  an example. That God heareth the god∣ly geuing to the askers in fayth / wysdom and other gyftis. It conteineth a testimony. That empy∣res  ād kingdoms be constituted of God. It monisshe vs / that the empyres  and kingdoms by lytle and lytle shall fall into worse and worse states / and the la∣ter and last shalbe / one aftir a nother more troublouse / full of synne and mis∣cheif and least iust. As was the Romane empire crueller and harder then the Per∣syk and Greke empires. It is testifyed that it is lawfull and  necessary for faythfull men to bere rule. For Daniel obtained the rule of certay∣ne prouinces for his felowes. In these firste fowr places are contai∣ned thre examples / that is to wete / two
of the mercy of God declared vpon the kynge and on Daniel / and one example of the wrath of God shewed vpon the wyse men of the worlde. The kynge Ne∣bucadnezar studyed & mused what shuld come of his realme and of the hole worl∣de: wherfore God created him a dreame wherby he shuld be certifyed what / and how many kyngdoms shuld before come, euen vnto the euerlastynge kyngdome of Christ / for God wolde in this dreame shewe Christ to the kyng and to his hai∣then realme, because he had before swor∣ne it by a sacred othe vnto the sead of A∣braham now captiued in the same real∣me of Babylon / saying: By my nownselfGen. 22. swere I / that in thy sead shall I blesse all nacions. Vvherfore / that this kynge and nowrce of Christ might knowe the Babyloni religion to be deuillisshe / and the Iewes religion to be Goddis trewe religion / he maketh the kynge to forgete his dreame / smytyng yet into his mynd so depe a dreadfull desyer to know it that not onely all the wyse sothe sayers and dreame tellers of Babylon / but also euen Daniel with his felows he wolde cōmande to be slayne onelesse they couldIt be∣houeth the vic∣tor to fe∣le what captiues he hathe 1. Samu l. 5 & 6. declare and shewe him his dreame. For as it behoued the Philisteins to haue
had experience what a geste thei had of the arke of God / euen so it behoued the victore king to knowe what maner men he had in captiuite: but yet wt more mer∣cy then pharo felt what gestis he had of the same sead. The wyse enchaunters preistis and sothe sayers of Babilon ar the example of the wrathe of God. For thei bosted and craked religiously drea∣mes to be shewed and declared of God & themselues to haue the coning to declare them / If ye haue this craft to interprete my dreame as ye professe it (saithe the kinge) so may ye as well haue the cōning of your goddis to tell me what I drea∣med. But seing that ye cannot tell me my dreame / ye declare yourselues worthei to be conuicted as very lyers and foles / ac∣cording as saith I saye. God cōfoundeth the wyse in their owne craftye subtylite the lorde knowth how vayne ar the studi∣es and thoughtes of the worldly wyse mē for in that thei denyed any man to may shewe that dreame / thei toke away the prouidence of god and denied the religiō of the iewes / that is to saye the lawe andgod how he is wt men. the gospell by the whiche meanes God is cenuersant withe men and reueleth his misteries.

For this is of a trwthe / God will firste shame, destroy, and confounde the false religion and the wyse politike pru∣dent mayntayners therof, before he reue∣lethe and bringeth in his gospell ād trwe doctryne.

For whoso obserueth the clowdes and wether shall neuer sowe nor reape. Eccle. 11. Daniel and his felows ar the exam∣ple of the mercy of God. For therfore wol∣de God / that the king and victore shuld threaten deth to Daniel captiued / that he shuld be constrayned to call vpon god and so thorowe his inuocacion the drea∣me shuld be known openly into the cōso∣lacion of the chirche captiued, and into the conuersion of the gentiles vnto cryst / for whom and by whom onely all thinges be done. When Daniel knewe the decreeText.
of the kyng and that sentence was geuen the wyse dreame tellers to be slayne / and that Daniel & his felowes were sought of Arioch the shryue to be slayne. Then Daniel toke ye mater in hande and sayed to the shryue. &c. This is an example of fayth in God almyghtye as hath the fyrste article of oure Credo.

But the promises of corporall bene∣fits / not onely require that we beleue the power of God to be myghty enough / but
also that he will helpe vs / yf it please him / when and how he hath decreed it, which condicion is not against the na∣ture of faith but declareth obedience / for all these must go togither / faith / obe∣dience / prayer / to aske and abyde Gods plesure. For so pray Dauid. 2. of the kyn∣ges. 15. And these. 3. men permitted the ende and maner of their delyuerance out of the ouen, vnto Gods will and plesure, whom they were euer redy to obeye.

I know it to be my dewtye to tell you the signes and wnderfull miracles which ye most hyghe god hath brought vpon me. For his to∣knes
are meruelouse great / and ryght mighty are his miracles / his kyngdome is an euerlasting kyngdom and his powr is perpetuall. I Nebucadnezar / happye and prosperouse in my familie / and ryche in my palace / did see a dreame so ferefull / that my thoughtes in my bedde troubled my head greuously / wherfore I sent oute a commandement / that all the wyse men of Babylon shuld be brought vnto me / to interprete my dreame. Then were there brought before me the wysemen / the soth sayers of chaldey / astronimers &ce. vntoBaltha∣sar is ye most hy∣ghe ke∣per of tresure. whom I tolde my dreame but ye interpre∣tacion therof thei cold not tell me / vntill at last there came daniel vnto me / whose name is Balthasar aftir the name of my god / which daniel hathe the spirit of the most holy god / and vnto him I tolde my dream saynge. Balthasar cheif master of the wyse men & astronimers all / in whom I knowe to be the spirit of the most holy god and that ther is no secrete mysterye hidde from the / tell me my drame & what it signifieth. For this was my dreame in my bedde. I did see a tree vpō the middis of the erthe whiche was fayer and highe The tre was great and stronge / so high that it reched vnto ye heuen ▪ and might be sene to the farthest parris  al the er∣the /
branches were fayer & lusty to be∣holde /  frute so plentuouse that it was meat sufficient for all thinges / vnder it as it were in a plesant shadewe there dwelt the wylde beastes / and the birdes nesiled in  branches / and all things ly uinge were fed of that tree. And whyls in my dreame I behelde it / lo there came downe from heuen in great spede an holy aungell / crying lowde and spekinge thus kutte downe the tree / and loppe of  bo∣wes / smyte of  branches / and skatere away  frute / and let the beastes & bir∣des flye their wayes from it / but the stok with the rotis thereof leaue still in the grownde / with chaynes of  & brasse so tyed that he may go and graze in the wylde felde and ly down vnder the dewe or rayne of the heuens / eating the moyste grasse with the brute beastes / and let the humane or manis reason be taken from him / & brute beastis senses be geuen him / vntil the course of seuen tymes be passed ouer him. And this thing was dected by the sentence of these spedy watchers in the counsell of these holy messagers from heuen / that al men lyuinge shuld knowe / that ye most highest must so rule & raigne in the kingdom and empyre of any mortal men / that to whom he lyste to geue it / the
shal raigne in it / and if he lyst / he will ly∣fte vp there vnto the moste abiecte and vileste man. This dream I kynge Nebu∣cadnezar did see / and thou Belthasar tell me what it meaneth / for all my wyse men cannot interprete it to me. Thou cannest for thou arte endewed with the spirit of the holy goddis. Danielis doctryne had confounded the wysedom of all the kinges spiritualtye / & therfore thei enuyed daniel and all the i∣wes so gretely / and kept the kynge thus long from this so godly an open cōfession and general pistle sent forth declaringe his faith and repentāce. This pistle she∣weth howe secure prowed & negligent he was in his prosperite / Into whiche secu∣rite negligēce, & pryde it is to be thought that his enchaunters sothe sayers & spiri tual wysemen had casten him for feare he shuld haue left his olde false religion. Now therfore the merciful god at last / whiche hathe kinges hertis in his handProu. 2. had cast him into a nother fereful dreame wher vpon he was thus moued to sprede∣forth the glorye of god & his owne peni∣tent cōuersion. First the kinge confesseth his faithe / then he sheweth the miracles of the. 3. former chapters / affirming no god able to do these miracles but onely
ye god of daniel / and at last he concludeth the kingdō of cryste (as it is in the. 2. ca.) to abyde for euer / god to be the changer of kingdoms & constitutor of kings. And here note diligently / Securite to be thesecurite is ye com¦paniō of welthi∣nes. companion of welthines / which securite casteth downe the kinge hedlong into ye forgeting of god / so that he was become negligent & prowde & in conclusion lyke a brute beaste. As saith the Psal. ManPsal. 48. when he was in honour he vnderstode it not / wherfore he degenereth into beastly nes. In this state (ah lasse for pite) lye many noble men of which securite saith dauid / when I was in prosperite / then I thought neuer to haue fallen.

Daniel was of a more feruent & faith∣fuller spirit towerde his kynge / then be now a dayes these flaterers so nyghe thē in fauour feding their affectis. For he so loued him / that he wolde tell him ye trwth were it neuer so odiouse, bitter▪ & displea∣saunt▪ vnto him. But in that he stayed so longe ere he spake / he declareth his pru∣dence /
both because he wold not seme ras∣she & also lest he shuld apere to reioyse of the king is misfortune. For albeit he was now with his countrymen in captiuite / yet wolde he be faithfull to the king and honour him iustly / yea although he knew how tender and delicate be princes ares corrupt with the gloriouse glaueringe of flaterers / and therfore the soner exaspe∣rated with sharpe and heuey tydings. The astonned slaknes of daniel caused the kinge to be the gredier of the trewth / which also seing the prophet to be so trou bled in himself / & as one not gladly wil∣ling to test him of siche heuines / was the more desyerouse to heare it and to haue his counsell. For the kinge perceyued so∣me waighty thing to be signified against himself. For where the diuine iugemēts so feare an innocent prophete / miche mo∣re shuld they be terrible to a wyked king. But yet the goodnes and intelnes of  kinge apereth againe / in that he anima∣teth the prophete exhortinge him to tell it whatsoeuer the dreame be / pardoninge him whatsoeuer he shall saye: But daniel elegantly and wysely first mitigateth ye mater / praying that these mischances si∣gnifyed / might fall vpon the kyngs eni∣mies. By which wordis / he nether spea∣keth
agaynst gods will / nor yet dissem∣bleth / but shewth himself to be heuye for the kings misfortune / declaring himself to be the kynges frende / or els he shulde haue wysshed euyll to himself. As though he shuld haue spoken playnly / for that I hold my peace so long / thinke not that I dowte of your dreame / but because I per∣ceiue it to be a fearfull vision / I pray god that it fall not vpon you. Daniel in telling the dreame / dige∣steth it goodly into thre partes / first de∣claring the felicite and prosperite of the kynge. Secondarily his punisshment. Thirdly his repentance. First he telleth him that the tree so great and hygh with all hir beuty / birdis / beastes and fru∣tes &c. signifieth the kynge Nebucadne∣zar: for that god had subdewed to him all other realmes / wherof before / he was called the golden head, and that not one∣ly for his ample power / but also for his hyghe arrogancye and pryde attributing to himselfe in his securite the glorye of god / whose imperye is ouer heuen and ye vniuersall erth. He also magnified him∣selfe the more for his often victories. For he was the Monarch of the worlde. And his name was fered ouer all. TheThe brā ches. fayer branches of it / are his myghty no∣bles
and princes. The plentuouse frutesThe fru∣tes. signified his yerely rentes and giftis wc his subiectes and all nacions willingly brought him. By the birdes nesiled in theThe bir∣des. branches, were signified his hygh, lerned, wyse men sothe sayers &c. taken as spiri∣tuall men, being of counsell with his god∣dis, to bringe to the kynge their oracles & answers from them / for this belly brodeMat. 13. &. 8. delyghteth yet to sitte and nesile a loft in their asy plesant nestis. By the beastisThe bea stis. lyinge vnder the tree / be signifyed the subiectes and comons lyuing quietly vn∣der his lawes / defended by the kynges power / and as it were vnder his winges. And as this goodly myghty tree feddeLerne ye kynges. & defended all these creatures / so ought the godly kynges as I say sayth / to be the nources and feders of their subiectes / se∣ing them vertuously brought vp in gods lawes / defending the innocēt pore afflic∣ted with iniuryes / and punisshinge the malefactours. For it is their office / notThe of∣fice of kynges onely to defende the publyk peace but al∣so punisshe ye malefactours and preserue and promote the godly lerned and to ta∣ke charge lyke a father and mother ouer the churche of criste, seing it taught gods worde faithfully and purely / quenching idolatry / and suppressinge all supersti∣ciouse
rytes &c. and tradicions of men. Hitherto pertayne all the places concer∣ning Magistrates, which kings and prin ces ought to know / for the good workis of kynges and princes are to do their office expressed in the scripture. Also the comō peple and subiectes signified by the lyue∣ly fowles and beastes fedde out of ye tree / their office and dewty is to geue thankis to god for the frutes and shadewe of their tree / and serue and obeye their prince praying incessantly for him. And albeit the golden head and this fayer tree signi fyed the babyloni monarchie and kyng / yet perteineth this doctryne vnto euery em▪  and prince yet lyuing which do∣inge his office / is the very golden gifte & most flourisshing frutefull tree of god. Secondarily where he seeth the spedy watcher and holy aungell so haastely de∣scending &c. He monissheth the kynge warning him of the iugement of god and of his owne humiliacion and deiection. For the voice of the holy watcher was ye sentence and decree of the most hygh god against the kynge / which vseth his aun∣gels thus to serue kynges and all good men / which are sayd to come downe that they shulde knowe manifestly whether ther were so great arrogancye, securite
and ingratitude in the kynge or no / as inAungels come downe. Cap. 11. Gene. 11. The lorde speaketh lykewyse of ye Sodomits. I will go downe & see whe∣ther the noyse which is comen vp to me be done in dede. And ayen / when they had buylded the towr of babel. The lorde went downe to se the cyte / which phrase of speche, lerne all iuges to not be to swyft in sentence geuing / but before all things / diligently to serche oute and knowe the cause. Here therfore first came downe the aungels and knewe the arrogancye & ne∣gligent securite of the kynge. Wherfore they  / kut downe the tree. That is to saye / cast downe the kyng from his digni∣te and honour / and let him be humbled. Then was he for his melancholy furye and haastines cast oute of his realme of his owne nobles / which was for that ty∣me his confusion & destruccion. And now he not being aknowledged of his nobles nor of his comōs / it is verefyed his bran∣ches to be  of, both greate bowes and small twigges / and all bothe his birdes and beastis to flye from him / oh merue∣louse soden mutacion of ye hyghe hande ofPsal. 76. god by his iust iugemēt to lese his subiects because himself wold not be a subiect vn∣to God / which because now he lyued a beasily barbarosse lyfe beinge mad a

For the persians diuide the yeare into 2. tymes / that is / into wynter & somer / or 7. tymes / is taken for ye iust complete tyme sufficiēt for his punishmēt geuen of god. And here be we lerned ye holy a waking aungels to be the kepers of godly kingesAungels kepe kyn∣ges and their re∣alme. & their realmes in al their wayes / as saith the Psal. The aungell of the lorde bull∣worketh rownd aboute ye godly. Hitherto perteineth the examples of godly kinges, of whom there was euer but a fewe euen in ye peple of god / wytnes Iesus Syrache 49.

For god nowe punissheth to amen∣de vs / wc shal at last / if we amende not / plage vs to punisshe vs. Nowe he seethLuke. 13. the figge tee planted in the vyne yarde / & he coming to seke therof frute / & none fyn∣ding / biddeth ye vyne keper / kut it downe / saing wherfore occupieth it the grownde vnto whome he answerthe. Sir let it yet this yere growe vntill I haue digged it aboute & dunged the rote / And if it bringe forthe frute it shal stonde / orelis let it be kut down. The vnthrifty sone taketh his fathers substance and spendeth it vicio∣esly / & at last was compelled to come to the hoggis troffe for hunger / but aftir∣warde he repented him remembring his fathers benignite / and so he retourning home is receiued withe grete ioye.

But yet did this vnhap∣py felicite make him forgete god his ma∣ker / and as an vnprofitable tree to be kut out of paradise. But yet abode the stok in the rotes / and in criste was his dignite conserued yea and encreased to / in that he repented. And euen thus haue we our∣selfs lost our kyngdom / loking for greuou∣ser punishment / vnlesse we obeye this most holsom counsell of daniel / which coū∣sell also all the scripture geueth vs / and cryst exhorteth vs ernestly therunto. Onely the deuyl reclameth and shutteth vp the bowels of mercye / oure myndis he puffeth vp / and entyseth vnto vnright∣wysnes to make vs his perpetuall cap∣tiues. The hebrwe text hath redeme thy synnes with rightuousnes. Of the which the defenders of their merits and aduer∣saries to faith iustifying / can take no hol∣de as they seme to themself. For the very rightwisnes or forme of rightwyse ma∣king before god is onely of faith wherby oure synnes be sorgeuen / of ye which faith trew almose, and workis of mercy pro∣cede
as doth the light from the sonne andTwo ry∣ghtwys∣nesses / one of faith one∣ly before god / and another of ye làwe before men. heat out of the fyer. Synnes be redemed before god in the rightwysenes of faith. And they be redemed before men in the rightwysenes of the lawe / of good wor∣kis / of mercye / as ye se here the almose to the pore to folowe at the redeming and re∣mission of synnes before god in the right∣wysenes of faith. So that the kyngs iust dealing, his mercy, compassion of the pore, were the testimonies of his repentance & iustificacion by faith. This counsell of daniel cōtaineth the hole lawe & gospell. First to know our synnes by ye lawe / thenThe or∣der of iu∣stificaciō to repente / and by faith to be absolued / of which all / as out of the tree ther procede ye frutes of repentance & faith that is the workis of loue and mercye to the pore af∣flicted. This counsell of daniel geuen to the kyng declareth / God straightly to re∣quire of the kyngs and princes not onely the obedience of his ten commandemēts but also princely iustice that is the dili∣gent cure and charge of his chirche / which was then (as it is nowe) cruelly entreated in captiuite of menis tradi∣cions / by the chirche vnderstande his subiectes to whom the kynge  a pu∣blike peace and fredome quietly to heare tryst the worde of god preched. And what Daniel taught his kyng / the same ought
all prechers to teche their kynges. For danielis doctryne perteineth to all em∣ kynges and preachers vnto the worldis ende / and especially vnto this last tyme of the last Monarchye wherin the same face of ye churche apereth / which then was sene. ☞ Nethelesse yet came all these thin∣ges ouer the kyng Nebucadnezar. For af∣tir.Text. 12. monethes / the kynge walkinge in his princely palace of Babylon sayd thus / Is not this great and mighty Babylon which I myself haue buylded by my now∣ne mighty power into the glory of my ma∣iestey a worthy bewtye for a kinges house & familye? Whyles the kynge was thus speking / there fyldowne a voice from he∣auen sayinge: Vnto the (oh kynge Nebu∣cadnezar) it is answerde and decrede / that thy kyngdome shalbe taken from the thou shalt be casten out fro menis compa∣nye / and with wylde beastis shalt thou lyue / eatinge grasse lyke an oxe tyll thy seuen tymes be passed ouer / to then tent thou shuldst knowe the moste hyghe God to gouerne and rule the kyngdome of mor∣tall men / to change and to geue them to whom he willeth. And euen in the same hower was this thing so fulfilled in Ne∣bucadnezar / that fro men was he casten
forth to eate grasse lyke an oxe / to lye forth wette vnder the skye vntyll his hea∣res were growne lyke ye fethers of egels and his nailes lyke the clawes of byrdes These wordes speaketh th kynge of himselfe as it were spoken in the persone of another man. All these thynges came to him / because he corrected and fered by dreames and monisshed by Daniel / yet wold he not repent and amende his lyfe. Nether did it repent god of his sentence. But he toke him in the middis of his vn∣godlynes when he thought himself most sewer & welthy blowinge forth his owne gloriouse pryde / his triumphes and ma∣gnificence not rendering the glorye vnto god / and therfore by this voice from he∣auen was he thus condempned and pu∣nisshed. God had taryed longe enough for his repentāce but because he was eue∣ry daye worse and worse he printed into him the depelyer his punishment / rebu∣kinge him the more sharply. But here let vs note the condicion and state of an im∣penitēt kynge for all his godly teachings prechings to him exhortaciōs moniciōs and godly bokis delyuered him by his pro∣phetes and lerned men. He walked vp and downe / whiche is a token of an ydle and priuate persone / he behelde his glo∣riouse
cosily buyldings / with sich wordi as declared wherin stode his transitory felicite and vayne affectis. Here thou seist a kyng ouer so many nacions prouin∣ces and tongues ydely walking, praysing himself / as though in all his so wyde a realme there had bene no seriouse thinge for him to do. How many poore afflicted persecuted good men were there oppres∣sed? was daniel and his felowes, the pe∣ple of god, there preching vnto him in ca∣ptiuite / all (thinke ye) well entreated? Wanted the kynge at that tyme no good counsell nor lerning? where stode the po∣re men with there causes to be hearde? Whatsoeuer honest paste tymes (as they call them) be imagined for kyngis to re∣create their spirits, pressed with studye and labours for the preseruacion of their realmes defense of their pore, and punis∣shing of malefactours; yet in their passe tymes / let them beware lest iustice / equi∣te and iugement be neglected / as they were in this kyngis ydle deambulacion. For by siche ydle securite kyngis haue fallen with Nebucadnezar into arrogan∣cy pryde and at last into blasphemyes / and so cast out of god from their realmes. And especially siche noble men as haue bene endewed with great giftis & prospe∣rouse
successes. For when they worship their giftis / their powrs, strength, trium∣phes, victories / their ryches &c. as their strange gods / then beginne they to despi∣se the very god. Whose comminacions once neglected, they will themselues toSennac. Timoth Athene. be worshipped for goddis. Example of Sennacherib thinking himself stronger then God. Timothe of Athenes bosted himselfe openly in his oracion sayinge: This victory haue I done and not fortu∣ne. Great Pompeius sayd he wolde withPompei{us} the great one spurne of his fote, fill all Italie. And thus by siche securite fill Nebucadnezar into pryde and synned agaynste the first table, trusting to miche to his owne wyse∣dom and strength / rightwyssnes, policye and power / of which ydolatry he fill into the breaking of the second table / euen in∣to the oppression and persecutinge of the chirche of God. Also / God not to maye bere nor suffere long these sewer and wel∣they proude contempners of his worde / namely the rulers of his peple / not onelySewer & proude kynges god ha∣teth. by all the comminacions of god / but also by the example of all kynges and prin∣ces destroyed for their securite and pryde we maye well confirme it. Howe misera∣bly was Sennacherib destroyed?  Timothe / aftir that proude sayinge / no∣thinge
prospered. And howe wretchedly Pompeius that vpspurner of the erth pe∣risshed / Lucanus describeth it. And how heuey was the image of this kynge / Da∣niel here paynteth him / tellinge him not onely to lese his kyngdome / but also his mynde and glorye which was miche be∣ter. Further more that this example of the wrath of god not being able to bere sewer and prwde kynges be not wryten for ploughe men and carters / but for em∣ and kynges to lerne them most of all to fere god when they most flourissh / haue yet moo examples. If god in dauid crystes father, might not bere the trans∣gression of his. 10. precepts / but for Vrios sake onely, casten him out of his kyngdom vndowted and certayn is it / none of the kynges of the erth to siande longe vnpu∣nished in their securite and pryde. Wher∣fore let all good princes lerne this lesson longe to rule well / euen not to worshippe themselues and their actes but to wor∣ship god as he techeth them / nether their owne belys and lustes to nourishe and fe∣de / but to nourish the churche of cryste.What princes shuld do For albeit the kyngdoms be the houses and kouers of the churche / yet for the trew churches sakis do the kynges and their kyngdoms prospere and flourisshe /
as witnesseth the scripture. Wherfore let all emro / kynges, and princes, sewer and prowde, wryte in the middis of their hertis this saying of Daniel. Thy kyng∣dom shalbe taken from the / to teche the to knowe the moste hyghe god to rule and gouerne mortall menis kingdoms / and to geue them to whom he lysteth. For what els dothe daniel here teache but all siche weal sewer emprowrs kynges and prin∣ces to be plaged lyke Nebucadnezar yf they repente not, and cease their persecu∣cion of cryst and of his chirche this daye captiued vnder their vngodly articles / actis / institucions and tradicions, con∣tempning gods ministers callinge them to a beter mynde / as did here the kynge despyse daniel admonishing him / & ther∣fore was he depriued of his kyngdome wytte and mynde to. But aftir this / I NebucadnezarText. lyfted vp myne eyes into heuen and came agayne to my mynde. And I blessed the most hyghe god / the euerlastinge syuinge god I praised / and magnifyed / whose re∣gall power is perpetuall and his kyngdo∣me dureth for euer and euer. For all the inhabitants of the erth are naught and nothinge estemed in comparison to him / which at his plesure doth what he lysteth
well with the company of heauen as with the dwellers vpon earth. Nether maye there any man let or holde bak his hande / or saye to him / what doist thou? or wherfore hast thou done thus? In this same tyme my mynde came againe to me / I receiued ayen my glory / the magnifi∣cence of my kyngdome / my emperiall ma∣iestye / my shappe and forme were resto∣red to me / My counsellers and my nobles sought me oute / and I was forestored in∣to my kyngdome that my maiesty was more ample then before. Now therfore I Nebucadnezar prayse / extost / magnifye the kynge of heauen / all whose workis be trew and his wayes right and iust. It is he that maye caste downe full lowe the prowde. This deieccion and humisiacion might not the kynge knowe beinge in his  securite and arrogant pryde. For then he blasphemed / he compessed men to idola∣trye / and was an heuey burden to all his realme. But nowe he tamed and plaged of god / beginneth to repente and is nowe restored to his mynde / now thus afflicted he knoweth god and himselfe / he murmu∣reth not against god for thus punishinge him / but he breketh forth into his prayse confessing his iust dealinge with him for
his offences / thus to be punished worthe∣ly / which he coulde not haue done except god by his graciouse goodnes had thus lyfted him vp and geuen him vnderstan∣ding. Here therfore haue ye an example of a penitent kyng / which delyuered from his miserye geueth god thankis / accor∣dinge to gods promise, saying. Call vpon me / and I shall delyuer the / & then shalt thou glorifye me. First here is described the affect of a penitent herte in his tribu∣lacion and arysinge therout / confessingeThe con∣fession of a peni∣tent. god to be iust in his threatis of the lawe / and to be mercyfull according to his pro∣mises of the gospell. Thus did kynge da∣uid repente and make his confession in the. 51. Psal. And daniel lykewyse cap. 9. powereth forth his herte before god / tea∣chinge vs lykewyse to repent and to be conuerted to God. Secondarily he ex∣presseth the frute of ye kyngs repentance / that is to wete / God to geue miche more ample giftis to the repentāt then he toke from them / as ye see him to haue done to Iob in his last ca. And daniel / for his mi∣series / oh how greate rewardis receyued he? Thirdly he expresseth the forme of thankis geuinge / euen to affirme god to raigne all  psalm. 118. and also in the hole psalter. For what els is the psalter
boke then the glasse of the most holy tri∣niteThe psal ter is ye boke of yt trinite. into this ende wryten for the chir∣che of the lyuing god / to lerne so to repen∣te and aftir our delyuerance to geue than∣kis to god as here do the kynge. Now sith all things be wryten / as Paul saith / for owr doctryne / let vs beholde whether there be not yet dayly daniels with their felowes sent vnto emprowrs and kyngdoms admonishinge them of ly∣ke mutacions and soden fallis / consyde how their wordis be regarded and their persones entreated. And whether for their cruell persecucion they be not, or ly∣kely to be shortely kut downe lyke this tree / caste oute of their dicions empyres and realmes, demented with duyllisshe doctryne, degenered into brute beastis fo∣lowinge their sensuall beastly lustes / ha∣uing their consciences fetered with me∣nis tradicions / snarled with superstici∣ouse ceremonies and romish rytes / lying yet still without the trewe chirche, naked▪ all vertu in stormes and derkenes of er∣rours more palpable then in the seruitute of egypt / because they will not receyue ye fre gospell of the lybertye of the spirit to be regenerated by faith / & so to do cryste vpon them, to be kouered with his right∣wysenes1. Cor. 1. Galat. 3. holynes &c. For these dreames
and visions be dayly sene / & as the first Monarchye was by daniel prophecied to be kut downe / euen so is this last Monar∣chye of the Romans threatened lykewyse of the watching aungell to be shortly smy∣ten downe / and the euerlasting kyngdom of cryste to be reueled vnto all flesshe, newly rysen from death vnto euerlasting lyfe / in which he graunt vs with his fa∣ther & holy spirit to lyue for euer / so be it. ¶ The argument of the. 5. chap. This chapter declareth the miserable fall of the last kynge of Babylon / & heuey mutacion and ende of his kyngdome for his idolatry and so greuouse synnes com∣mitted against the firste precept. Here is described a superfluouse fest full of exces∣se / euen a very beastly banket / where vn∣to kynge Belsazar biddeth his nobles / in which is manifestly shewed into what an vnhappy ende siche viciouse intempera∣te excesse comethe. All kynges and prin∣ces maye lerne of this fall of so hyghe a kynge to feare and to worshippe God as the. 2. psal. teacheth them / lest of God the translator of kyngdoms, they be depriued their realmes with Belsazar. THe kynge Belsasar made an exce∣dingText. feste biddinge therto a thou∣sande of his princes and nobles in
whose presence he dronke the wyne / & at the workinge of ye wyne he cōmanded the golden and syluer vessells to be brought forth / whiche his father Nebucadnezar had taken awaye out of the temple of Ie∣rusalem / that the kynge / his nobles / his wyues and concubines might drinke out of them / which done / or in doinge / they praised and worshipped their owne gol∣den / syluery / coper /  / treen and ston ney goddis. Hytherto god hath setforth his glorye in the conuersion of Nebucadnezar / now he declareth his gloriouse powr in de∣stroying and an ende making of so migh∣ty a monarchye of the vngodly Babylo∣nits / which destroyd / he with great glo∣rye wolde sende home agayne his peple to buylde vp ayen a temple more gloriou∣se then before. In the former chap. ye see a kynge repenting himself and bringing forth the trwe worship of god / whom god orned and endewed with giftis. Now ye haue a contrary example of a wyked kyn∣ge restorynge idolatrye / not repentynge / whom God therfore casteth downe and geueth his kyngdome to other men. Now were the. 70. yeres expired in which the iewes (as Ieremy tolde them) shuldNebuca. continew in captiuite / for Nebucaduezar

Euen siche as were Sardanapalus / Heliogabalus and this last kynge of Babylon / which in ban∣keting with his whores in a blasphemou∣se spight of the god of Israel / thus abu∣sed his holy vessells, drinkynge dronken out of them with her lots, which because he wold not be monisshed with his grand∣fathers punishment nor take ensample at his repentance▪ god toke this heuey ven∣geance vpon him and his realme. Nebu∣cadnezar was  downe to be exal∣ted / but Belsazar was deiected to be wt all Babylon vtterly destroyed / As Isay / Abacuk / and Ieremy had prophecied be∣fore. In this destruccion of the first Mo∣narchye lerne the figure of the destruc∣cion of the worlde in this the ende of theIsay. 21. Abac. 2. Iere. 51. last Monarchye / when thou se est lyke em prowrs & kynges to raigne ouer the world
For as God is the most iust translatour & changer of realmes / so doth he destroye them for right iust causes. This Belsa∣sar was the very canell of all fylthynes euermore runing from one syn to a nother First his viciouse interperācye is descri∣bed how he was geuen to excesse dronke∣nes horedome and blasphemye of God / which is an euident token of his realme shortly to be translated and himselfe de∣stroyed. Deliciouse delicates effeminate ryght strong men▪ and miche the soner the soft Assyriōs. By siche carnalite was Ca∣pa made a Canne to Hānibal. Wel therEccle. 10 fore sayd the wyseman / Wo to that lande whose kyng is a chylde, and here princes delyte in erly and late drinking & eating. A meruelouse blynde sensuall securite, to see the kynge to celebrat siche a fest, bid∣ding therto all his nobles to eate / drinke dronken / takinge their pleasures in ban∣ketting / daunsing / singing & playinge so sorowlesse / their enimyes kynge Cyrus and Darius beseging the cyte? They ha∣lowed a certayn hyghe fest daye of their god Beel as ye se aftir this maner now to do some called Crystians in all nyght eatinge and drinkinge / which when Cy∣rus knewe it / he had chosen himself the more apt tyme to take the cyte. Thus we∣re
ye Sodomits sodenly vnwares oppres∣sed. Thus were they drowned with No∣has floude. And so shall all the worlde at last be sodenly destroyd with fyer. Wher∣fore let vs suspect all siche welthye and vngodly securite. Here ye see how that in tyme of bataill when he shuld haue cal∣led vpon the very god / he called togither his princes to eate and to drinke beyende all mesure▪ ànd to worshippe false gods. And when his enimies layd awayt to de∣stroye him and his cyte, he contempned them as one sewer enoughe, seruinge not god / but his belye. And when he shulde haue bene compased with his armed host he sate drinking and eating excessiuely emong his vayne flaterers and soft her∣lets. Now was sage daniel farre from the court / and yong minions were of Roboās counsell. Nowe were his spiritualtye as his sothesayers, dreame doctours, enchaū∣ters, sorcerers, diuines, at his hande tea∣chinge him in all securite to blasphemeAn alle∣gory in sylence expresse∣ly omit∣ted. deryde and to contempne the god of da∣niel. And in despyght of him thus to abu∣se and prophane the iewels of his house. I will not here with an allegory applyed to oure tyme / touche oure spirituall Ma∣gos and subtyle sorcerers / enchaunters / and bewitchers of their emprowrs, Bel∣sazars
/ with flaterye and polytyk persua∣sions auertynge them from danielis doc∣tryne and holsome monicions vnto their olde papistrye / so vigilantly obseruynge and waytinge vpon emprowrs and prin∣ces affectis, to sette to their wynges the swiftlyer to flye and folow their deuillish dampnable counsels making them dron∣ken of that Babyloni blody whores cup of abhominacion / that they might ye more blasphemously abuse and prophane the holy vessels of godis temple / euen to per∣secute and burne the trewe ministers ofAllegori∣es must be vnloc∣ked wt their owne keyes. the gospell, peruert and violently wrest his worde to make it serue to their syn∣full lustes and carnall affectis / although I know the scripture with hir owne keye clerely to open and vnloke this same alle∣gory Apocap. 17. Et nunc igitur reges in∣telligite. But now ye kynges get ye know∣leg and be taught monisshed in tyme / &c. Here shulde the kynge with his Babylo∣nits haue repēted and called for daniels doctryne and counsell and not haue ban∣nisshed him and his felowes his courte. In so present perelis to promyse themsel∣ues siche securite / to reioyse in banket∣tinge and festinge / to blaspheme god and despyse his trwe ministers and prechers and to neglect repentance / is the moste
certayne signe of an vtter subuersion of their kyngdome and empyre. This storie / first warneth vs of the hor∣rible powr of ye deuyll / which in all ages abuseth the moste hyghe emprowrs / kyn∣ges and princes to confirme idolatrye / and to in sondre the chirche of cryst Wherfore very fewe princes in the later dayes shall abolish the pope, retaine and holde the trewe worship and religion of god. Against yt which sclaunder and hur∣te it is necessary / godly myndes to be ar∣med & defended. And here it behowueth godly men to knowe the synnes of em∣prowr and princes / whiche therfore do they corrupt and destroye the trewe doc∣tryne / because they wolde attemper and drawe Gods worship and religion vnto their owne profits and couetouse mynds / which verely is not els then openly to il∣lude and mocke cryst / of which blasphe∣mose skorning of cryst / thissame oure age hath to many examples. Secondarily this storye exhorteth prin¦ces vnto godlines / and warneth them of the plages hanging now ouer all vngod∣ly princes headis. Thyrdly it testifyeth mutaciōs of kyng∣doms and realmes to be done of god now shortely for the diuerse and manyfolde
crymes and enormities of the emprowrs kynges and princes. And here god punis∣sheth idolatrye & blasphemie / as in Ma∣nasse & in the kynges of Israel. In daui∣de he punisshed aduoutry and his coun∣sell to murther Vrias. But it happenethA lyek sentēce. Prou. 29 oft that the synnes of the peple be concur∣rant with their princes wykednes. As in Osee the. 4. Siche princes and preistis / siche peple. Nether is it to be douted / but that these calamities / plages and punis∣shments of the worlde which now are be∣gune / be cast vpon it for their manifolde manifest idolatrye, glosed with a certayn reuerent behauore to images / and also cō∣mitted in their  o / for their false inuo∣cacions, prayinge to dede saintes and do∣me images / for their supersticious decēt rytes, and illaudable falsely signifyed ce∣remonyes / tradicions of men / & for their abhominable horedome / for their forbid∣dinge of lawfull matrimonye / for sepera∣ting and violating iustely maryed perso∣nes / for turnynge crystis faith and reli∣gion oute of the holy Byble, settinge it vp into menis prophane decrees and consti∣tucions / there exaltinge their owne po∣pishe articles of their false fayth, aboue god, and punishing them aboue the trans∣gression of gods precepts. Wherfore the
vessels of Gods heuey wrath be nowe  powering forth vpon all regions / empy∣res and kyngdoms worthely. For theise errours in honoring and fering man mor∣tact and his tradiciōs aboue god and his almighty worde / now is the wrath of god made manifest from heauen vpon all vn∣godlynes▪ vnrightwysenes &c. Hereof itRom. 1. cometh that the Turke hath so good suc∣cesse & prospereth in his warres so migh∣tely agaynst all crystendome.

The lorde be mercyfull to vs / So be it. It maye be here asked whether the se∣culare kynges and princes / maye take a∣wayeof ye vse of ye goo∣di of ye chirche the chirche goodes? An answer that the chirche goodis belong to the po∣re / and now seinge the possessours be ry∣che lordely bisshops / abbots / priestes &c. these goodis belonge nomore to them / for their owne proude lordely ryches putte themselues oute of possession. But synne they not wt Belsazar that cōuert ye chirche goodis into prophane vses? I answere: These vessels of ye temple prophaned of Belsa. were consecrated by ye word of god Wherfore he synned in prophaning them
But the goods and iewels of oure tem∣ples / abbeys and bisshoprykis▪ are not cō∣secrated to siche vses by gods worde / but by their owne inuented couetuose char∣mings / wherfore emprowrs / kynges and princes maye take them awaye and putt them to beter vses / as to the maintenāce of scoles / vniuersities / to sustayne trewe teachers and godly prechers. For it is wryten / the workman is worthey his wa∣ges. Bisshops and preistes that preche not purely ought of the princes to be de∣posed & their possessions taken from them For the princes and magistrats oughtIdle bi∣sshops goodis shuld su∣staine poore cō grega∣ciōs and scoles. to conuerte the goodis of these ydle erth burdens into the sustentcion of the poo∣re / and maintayne teachers and scolers lerning the tongues and holy scriptures / so that the chirches and ciuile ministra∣cion be not destituted lerned men at any tyme. For it is wryten / whoso labore not / let him not eat. Wherfore / as they be prai∣sed which / the ydle bely burdēs remoued, substitute apt and lerned labourers / euen so synne they which translate the chirche goodis into prophane vses (which thing is now to comon) suffering the pore chir∣ches, congregacions, and scoles to be cold and hongrye. For it is wryten / he that i taught / let him imparte all thinges ne∣cessarye

Wherfore yfThey propha∣ne ye chir∣che goo∣des that suffer ye iust mi∣nisters to want. the nources of cryste / of their owne sub∣stance be bounde largely to sustayne sco∣les & congregaciōs / how miche more be they bounde to maintaine them of other∣mens goodis / that is of their wyked mā∣mon now goten▪ I cannot see how that man maye nourisshe the congregacions & scoles which neglecteth the ministers of chirches and scoles / euen the verye pa∣rents of all goodnes. Let all princes see diligently that lawfull and apte mini∣sters be honestly entreated and nourished and that pore scolers of the chirche goo∣dis be sustained, to conserue the necessary studyes of the chirche. But it is a damp∣nable dede to geue so greate wages to maintayne the superfluouse excesse and viciouse lyuing of ydle bisshops / preistis and monkis / the trewe flokfeders neg∣lected / studyes and scoles not conserued. Nether haue the princes power to trans∣late to themselues thecclesiasti goodis / with the defrauding of the pore chirches and scoles / but shuld asmiche as nede is / impart them to the poore congregacions scolers and techers / yea this shulde they do / were ye goodis their owne / miche lesse ought they to take awaye that is geuen them / and well vsed / except they abuse it
contrary to the geuers will. And albeit ye geuers falsely enstructed, erred in their giftis: yet ought the magistrats now be∣ter taught▪ to take it awaye and reforme the errours in the geuing therof. Nether becometh it bisshops and preistis which shuld onely folowe cryst and his apostle, to be lordes ouer landes and possessions tangled with ciuill and polityke seclare causes. Thus ye see in what cases the se∣culare magistratis may translate the ec∣clesiasty▪ goodis vnto themselues / proui∣ded aboue all that the pore congregaciōs and comon scoles and vniuersities be su∣stained and maintayned with the same. Fyftely in the changes of kyngdomsmat. 24. god forgeteth not his chirche as cryst cō∣forteth vs / sayinge: When ye shall heare rumors of bataill and warre / be not you troubled therat. For we must wysely de∣cerne the kyngdōs of ye worlde from that eternall kyngdom of god which is crysts chirche. For albeit these batails and per∣secucions skater / inquiet / and trouble ye chirches of goodmen in these heuey mu∣tacions of empyres and kyngdoms / yet haue the godly euer this present consola∣cion, That the chirche of cryst is an euer∣lasting kyngdom / and maye not by despe∣racion, fall from out of crystis religion vn
to the vngodly / as they do now in Grece. For the verite saith: Father / whom thou hast geuen me / noman shall take them fro me / for they dwell in me & I in them inseperably. Also in the mutacion of this kyngdom of Babylon / god lyfteth vp da∣niel geuing him a greater fauour and au∣torite with the newe kynge Cyrus then euer he had before / that euen now the hai∣then kyngis yet might be cōuerted to the knowlege of god / for the preseruacion of his chirche and that the publyk miracles might be knowen, testifying this peple of the iewes to haue the worde of God and trewe religion. Now haue ye sene the ab∣hominable open crymes of Belsazar / as blasphemye / idolatrye / reuerent behaui∣our to images / drōkenes / glotoney / whor∣dome / vngodly securite / cōtempt of gods prophetis and prechers / despyght of his peple &c. to be the synnes which God cā∣not longe suffer vnpunisshed, as wytnes∣seth the kings miserable destruccion and mutacion of his realme / and the heuey cō∣minaciōs of his. y. precepts / and as I say prophecieth of Ierusalem Babylons sy∣ster / saying: The daye shall come wherin the lorde God of powers shall call syche synners vnto wayling / weping / tearinge of their heares / and to gyr themselues
with sake: but what then shall they do? they shall reioyse / feste, banket, and make merye, kyll oxen & shepe / eat fleshe, drin∣ke wyne, sayinge let vs eat and drinke / to morowe shall we dye / wherfore these so greuouse synnes of kynges accordinge to his cōminacions shall the heuey han∣de of god viset as it folowethe. And euen in the same houre thereText. apered ye fyngers of a manis hande wry∣tinge agaynst the candell in the whight parget of the wall of the kynges palace / The kin∣gis spiri∣tualty is called to court the kynge himself beholding the fyngers so wryting. Then was ye kynges face paal and his cogitacions so ferefully troubled him that the ioyntis of his hippes and knees folldened downe double vnder him. Then the kynge cryed commanding his spiritualtye / his wyse men, enchaun∣ters, desteny tellers / and sothe sayers of Chaldey to be brought vnto him, thus spe∣king these wordes to the wyse men of Ba∣bylon. Who so euer shall reade this wry∣ting / & tell me what it meaneth / he shall∣be cled with purpure and shall haue a cheine of golde about his necke / and he shalbe the thirde in my realme. Then ca∣me all the kynges lerned wysemen which nether coude reade the wrytinge nor tell the meaning therof to the kynge. Wher∣fore
kynge Belsazar was the more vehe∣mently troubled / in so miche that his chere was all changed and his princes and nobles greuously astonned. Euen in the same houre wherin his vngodlynes was rype / & he blasphemed god / the lorde wolde glorifye his owne name in that all men shuld se the kyng∣dom of Babylon by the diuine iugement to be subuerted / & himself to be the chan∣ger and translator of kyngedoms and ty∣mes / euen in the same houre wherin the kynge thought himself most sewer & most beloued with his goddis for so worship∣ping them being in the middis of welthy plesures / was this heuey sentēce wryten and geuen forth agaynst him. Before the sentence pronounced and ratifyed / there was tyme and place to repente him: butMat. 25 now ye gatis shut vp / in vayne do ye folys∣he virgins aske oyle / bringingforth their laumpes with knockinge. In vayne wept Esau aftir Iacob had prerept him hisGen. 27 blyssinge. Let vs therfore seke the lorde whylis there is tyme to fynde him: CallHeb. 13. on him whylis he is nyghe. Impenitent persones, nether fynde they nor seke they. Now saith god / send I no prophete to pre∣cheIsay. 55. the repentāce / but I wryte the thy iu∣gement vnable to be reuoked which thou
mayst feare / but auoyde it / thou mayst not Whoso turneth and thrusteth awaye my worde and prechers, frome him I will in his most nede nether counforte nor pro∣phete sende him. The kynge himself alo∣ne / and first ofall / did see this hande wry∣ting / and not his gestis / as did BalamsNum. 22 assese the aungell which Balam saw not The hand came glyteryng forth agaynst the lyght & candlestyke. Rabby Saadias saith that it was the hande of Gabriel.Rabby Saa∣dias. But it was the hande of god / and man to be / euen of cryst: which is the mighty aun∣gell of godis counsell and hande of the fa∣ther. Then the kynge changed his chere heuely. Sewhat an heuey soden change ther is in the iugement of god. Who was more puftvp with pryde and more arro∣gant / sewer and sorowlesse then was the kynge▪ but at this heuey vnwont syght / how trembled he? For nether in himself nor in his dronken lordis and wyse spiri∣tualtye founde this miserable kynge any helpe or conforte / and why? verely he had bannisshed the court and neglected da∣niel ye minister of godis confortable wor∣de. But and yf he quaked and was so ter∣ribly afrayde at this hand / with what an horrible feare shall the hole glorifyed bo∣dy of cryste and his ferefull face smyte ye
impenitēt vngodly / when he shall in his almighty maiestye come downe ayen to iugemēt, pronouncinge with his mouthe his graue sentence and iugement ayenst the wyked? The kynge  out strongly in this his feare / but not to god almighty but to his images. He fled to his wyse∣men of the worlde / to his diuines & char∣mers as do they which haue their spiri∣tualtye / fryers and bisshops in siche esti∣macion for their popish lerning, worldly wysedom, and preistly pollicye. But none of them might helpe nor counforte him or swage his sorowe. He promiseth fayer / he threteneth bitterly / but all helpeth not / other men begane to loke narowly vpon the hande wryting / supposing it to be so∣me fantasye and illusion / but yt iugemēts of god be vnknowē to the vngodly / onely reuesed to ye chyldren of god. His nobles were also troubled therewith. For they which were parteners of the kyngis im∣piete / must nedis be partakers of his pu∣nishment. So sone so / is the plesure and ioye of this worlde turned into sorowe. This pese contayneth the example of the kynge now despeyering in aduersite / because his wyse spiritualtye of the worl∣de coude not turne the wrath of god from him. Whereby we maye confirme the cō∣minaciōs
of god to be trewe. This hand∣wryting on this maner / I suppose / signi∣fyed the prophecies of Isay / Abacuk andIsay. 21. Abac. 3. Iere. 51. 2. Pet. 2. Ieremy now to be fulfilled. Let all kyngs and peple be afrayd at Peters sayinge: Sodom and Gomor to be destroyd into ye ensample of lyke synners. Because that Belsazar is an example that mutacions of empyres and realmes be done of God for their a bominable synnes / let them allkingdōs for their synnes be cha∣ged. as in a glasse beholde this example / lest sodenly for their idolatrye blasphemouse persecucion of his ministers and worde / they be destroyd as it standeth in the psal∣me. 33. Whylis the kynge was in his fea∣stinge / the hande of God wryteth his de∣strucion / let thē lerne therfore to estiew excesse dronkenes and blasphemies in banketinge and festing euen the most cer∣tayne signes of ye mutacion of their real∣mes.1. thes. 5. 1. Sa. 28 Isay. 8. and. 23. Deu. 18. Let siche sewer  rulers beware of a soden fall / for when they crye peace and securite then is there present a soden destruccion. The kynge thus troubled as∣ked counsell at his diuines & charmers as did Saul at the dead / which is ayenst god saying: I shall destroye the wysedom of the prudent. And seinge it helped not / he was sore vexed / which signifieth / not onely the cogitaciōs of the worldly wyse
to be vayne / but also that before the reue∣lacionThe re∣uelaciō of gods worde cō foūdeth the wyse idola∣ters. of gods worde / god is euer wont to confounde and shame menis doctryne & tradicions contrarye to his worde / wolde god emprowr and kyngs wold se diligent ly to the godly instruccion of themselues and their peple by faithfull fre prechers and good bokis. But because this cure of soules touche so fewe rulers / and we will all with a lytle teachinge or non at all / be greate coninge crystianes / it is come to passe that emprours and kyngis maiestes cannot defende themselues / the counsels of their wyse be made voyd / god euer say∣ing: Thy empyre shalbe taken from the / and be geuen to thy better. And contrarye wyse / the godly in aduersite to be counfor∣ted / as this part folowng declareth it. Then the quene hearinge of thisText. feare and trouble of the kynge & his prin∣cesthe que∣ne was his grā∣dame / Nebuc. wyfe. came into the banketinge house say∣inge: kynge / longe be thy lyfe. Let not thy thoughtis trouble the nether chang thou thy chere. For there is in thy realme a man endewed with the spirite of the holy gods / in whom in thy fathers dayes ther was found the lyght of knowlege and si∣che vnderstandinge & wysedom as haue the goddis / him thy father Nebucadne∣zar made bishop of all the lerned diuines
of the wyse men the spiritualty of the Chaldeis and prophets or sothesayers / the kynge (I saye) thy father did so: be∣causeFather is here his grād father. that in daniel / whom the kynge na∣med Belsazar / there was founde a plen∣tuouser and hygher spirit / coning and vn∣derstandinge to expown dreames, to de∣clare secretes, and to solute harde que∣stions. Now therfore let daniel be called which shall interprete and declare this thinge. And thus was daniel brought to the kynge. Vnto whom the kynge sayde: Art thou this daniel one of the sonnes of the captiuite of Iuda / whom the kynge my father brought out of Iuda. I heare saye thou hast the spirit of the holy god∣dis / and not onely to be illumined and wy∣se / but also to be in the an hyghe amplier prudence then in other men. There were now brought in before me / my spiritual∣tye / diuynes and wyse men to reade this wryting / and to shewe me the interpreta∣cion therof / but they coude not. But I hea re that thou canst do it / wherfore yf thou canst reade and interprete me this scrip∣ture / thou shalt be cled with purpure &c. All this maketh for the confusion of ye kynge and his wyse men. For when they all were thus troubled and amazed then come thereforth this olde woman with
good counsell and counfort / yf any had bene left them. This quene was sober & not in the fest emonge these dronherds with their herlottis / and therfore she re∣membreth and commendeth daniel with hyghe prayse vnto hyr neuye the kynge / whom the more she commendeth / the mo∣re shame it was to the kynge all those. 3. yeares raignynge to not knowe / but neg∣lect so wyse and godly a counseller. She called him not a captiue / but spake reue∣rently of him with hyghe cōmendacions / but the gloriouse kynge spyghtfully asked him. Art not thou that daniel one of the captiues of the iewes? This place cōtey∣neth two sermons / the one of the godly quene / & the tother of the ongodly kynge vnto daniel / by whom daniel in the mu∣tacion of the kyngdom is promoued & the promise of god is declared to be trwe / say∣ing: I will be mercyfull into thousandis / The olde quene forgote not the trwe doc∣tryne of daniel / as ye see by hyr wordis commendinge him for his diuine spirit / for his lerning, prudence, wysedom, and of his bishoply dignite and ning to inter∣prete dreames / mysteries / and to solute harde questions. She monisheth yt kynge godly / vnder a colour of daniels prayse to call him in and heare him / but he cal∣led
him of ye same entent as Herode cal∣led cryst / as ye maye see in his skornfull question asked him. For as the calling of daniel nowe to late to the court made for the kyngis confusion / so made it for da∣niel and the chirches helthe and counfor∣te / which vnder vngodly emprours and kyngs denyinge them socour and ayde in their landes / maye not there dwell and flourissh / wherfore the chirche so longe wayleth and suffereth exylie vntyll god correck the kynges for hyr sake as dauidpsa. 10. testifyeth. Blessed therfore be God oure heuenly father which so tenderly taketh charge ouer the forsaken and banisshed ministers of cryst oure kyng / in the king∣doms of this worlde / that in kyngis haw∣lis and courtes there is euer founde an Abois / which will defende Elias ayenst the denylly she tongues / and so in the mu∣tacions of realmes promote him / as was1. of the kings. 18 Gen. 19. here daniel exalted / but not yet so to esca∣pe wt lot / the Sodomitis all sonken. It is here to be noted / that the kyng iuged his sophos to haue the spirit of his holy go∣dis as now do emperours and kynges iuge of their holy ghostly fathers the fryers and bisshops. ☞ Then answerd Daniel before theText. kynge / saying: Take thy rewardis to thy
self / and thy gift is geue them to another. Nethelesse will I reade the wryting to ye kynge and the meaninge therof shall I shewe the. Vnto thy grandfather Nebu∣cadnezar (oh kynge) the most hyghe god gaue this kyngdom / maiesiye / glorye and magnificēce. And for this his ample ma∣iestye geuen him all peple / nacions & ton∣gues fered and dreaded him / for that he slewe whom he lysted / & reserued alyue whom he willd / he exalted whom he wol de / and thrusted downe whom he wolde. But when his hert was thus puft vp wt arrogancye and pryde / he was deposed from his seat royall / and they toke awaye his glorye. And he was expelled fro men a beasily mynde geuen him / to wandre emong wylde asses & was fed with gras∣se lyke an oxe / the dewe fallinge from a∣boue standinge vpon his bodye lyinge in the felde vntyll he aknowleged the most hyghe god to gouerne and translate the kyngdoms of mortall men to whom he ly∣steth. And albeit thou Beltsazar beinge his neuy haste knowne all this / yet hast thou not humbly submitted thyself vnto him but exalted thyself ayenst the lorde of hun commanding the vessells of his house to be brought before the / that thy∣selfe / thy nobles / thy wyues and whores
might drinke wyne out of them. Gods of syluer / of golde / coper /  / tree and of stonne which can nether see nor heare / nor fele / nor knowe any thinge / thou hast praysed and loaued. But god which hath thy breathe and lyfe and all thy wayes in his hande thou hast not worshiped / wher∣fore thissame hande is sent the of him to wryte the this same scripture. And euen this is the wryting. Mene Mene / The∣kel / Vpharsin: as miche to saye / as god hathe tolde vp and made an ende of thy kyngdome. Thekel is to saye: Thou art wayed vp in a bylance / and art founde to lyght / or thou art bought and sold. Phe∣res / that is: Thy kyngdome is diuided and translated to the Medis and Perses Now is daniel called to be the foreshe∣wer of the iugement of god / nether salu∣tinge the kynge / nor praysing his giftis / in which thinge he declareth the kynge to be casten awaye of god / & therfore vn∣wortheyEccl. 10. reuerence / he openly rebuketh him for his greuouse synne, shewinge the sentence of god to be geuen vpon him and his kyngdom. He nether flattereth him nor thanketh him for his giftis / he sel∣leth not the grace of god for kyngis gif∣tis: but sheweth him playnly the causes why he shuld be slayne and his kyngdom
translated. First therfore daniel begin∣neth at the office of a trewe precher notThe of∣fice of a trew pre∣cher. sekinge his owne / but gods glory & other menis profyt / euen the helthe of the con∣gregacion by confessynge the trewthe. The adacite and bolde speche of daniel signifyeth the abieccion of the kynge and his realme. Then he layeth before Belt∣sazar the examples of his grandfatherThe ex∣amples of gods wrath ar not to be neglec∣ted. Nebucadnezar / wherat because this king his neuy amended not / but was worse / he declareth his synne to be the greuou∣ser. For they synne most greuously of all which amende not themselues at other mens punisshment / but neglect the for∣mer wryten examples of gods wrath. As there was seuentymes double punishmēt decreed vpon the slayer of Cain / & seuen∣tymes seuen more payne for the layer of Lamech. And cryst in Mat, How depely damneth he the ingrate cryties that wold not be monished by Sodom and Gomor?Mat. 10 and. 11. wherfore yf Beltsazar was slayne becau∣se he wold not be moued to repentance by thexample of his grandfather / let vsThe vse of ye exā∣ples of gods wrath. now taught with other menis perells / amende oure lyues / lest for lyke synnes we suffer lyke paynes. For verely / euen this to be the vse of all thexamples of gods wrathe / it is plaine in Paul to the
Corinthes. 1. Corin. 10. sayinge: Oure fa∣thers were smyten downe in the desert / because they shulde be vnto vs figures and monicions that we fall not into lyke lustes. These thinges be wryten for oure warninge, ouer whom the ende of ye worl∣de hangeth. Wherfore whoso standeth / beware he fall not. Daniel amplifyeth & aggrauateth the greuousnes of the kyn∣ges synne, by coupling strange and cōtra∣ry gods with the very trewe god / signi∣fyinge the kynge not therfore onely to be depriued his lyfe and realme / because he cōtempned the example of the wrath of God in the fall of his grandfather / not moued therat to repent / but also because he passed farre his grandfather insynne / in that he blasphemed the very God / in worshiping & doing reuerent behauours to his false gods and images and propha∣ning or abusing ye holy vessels. And thus doth daniel tell the kyng / to be destroyed & his kyngdom to be translated for these two synnes / one because at the exampleFor two synnes / kingdōs be tran∣slated. of Nebucadnezar he wold not be warned to repent himself / the  other synne is the violatinge of the first and 2. commande∣ments in committing idolatrye and wor∣shipinge or reuerencinge images which ther is no synne more greuouse deseruing
the present punishment powered forth of the wrath of God from heuen both vpon emprours / kynges / princes & vpon their empires and kyngdoms / as ye here see it manifestlye. The thre wordis wryten of the han∣deThe ex∣plicaciō of the. 3. wordis. of god / Mene Mene / Thekel / Vphar sin. Daniel expouneth thus. The first worde Mene signifieth god to haue noū∣bred / tolde / or mesured / and apoynted the symites and tyme vnto tyraunts, beyend the which they shall not passe / nor before the which tyme prefined by gods infalli∣ble and immutable prouidence, they shall not fal nor dye. Mene therfore signifieth the tyme of the mutacion? And the tother two word is signifye the maner of the mu∣tacion / not onely of this kyngdom / but of all the kyngdome of the worlde at all ty∣mes, so to come to passe by Gods decreed will. Also the repeticion of this worde Mene hath a greate pythe / signifyinge the tyme and houre offiche decreed iuge∣ments of god certaynly and sodenly to co∣me vpon them. As sayde Moses to the Corites. And as in this oure tyme saythNum. 16 Draconites / was that tyraunt depriued his gouernāce at his rype tyme / when he sayd: that he had seuer God in heauen to haue bene dead then his owne wyked fe∣lowe.
Well therfore prayeth the Psalme agenst siche blasphemouse tyrants that fewe and shorte might be their dayes / for they be very Iudases. Wherfore / as thispsal. 108 worde Mene warneth tyrants of Gods heuey iugement hanging ouer their hea∣dis / that they shuld repent and be monis∣shed according to the. 2. psal. as was Eze∣chias and so obtained. xv. yeres addid to his lyfe / so it counforteth / the oppressed of tyrants that we shulde suffre paciently and endure constantly for that the Psal. sayth. Shortly and sodenly shall the vn∣godly be destroyed and perisshe.Psal. 2. The tother two wordis Thekel and V∣pharsin tell vs the plages and maner of their coming. Thekel signifyeth Beltsa∣zars kyngdome to be now wayed / bought and solde from him. The thirde worde. Vpharsin signifyed his kyngdome to be diuided from that nacion vnto ye kynges of Mede and persie. For the first plage of emperour / kynges / princes and preistes is to lose their auctorite and name as hath the psal. Contempt is powered forth vpōpsal. 106 princes and rulers god makinge them to erre in a wrong waye / but the poore afflic∣ted he helpeth out of this trouble and fe∣deth his housholde as his owne shepe. Sith empires and realmes stand by gods
power / it must nedis be God that geueth kynges their auctorite as it is wryten.1. reg. 10. And parte of the hoste went their wayes with him / euen they whose herts god had towched. Also thexamples of all ages wytnes. The noble men to haue bene va leant in auctorite / & not by manis power and wysedom to haue enioyed their her∣tis desyers. Wherfore whensoeuer any mutacion hangeth ouer the princes and rulers headis and their realmes / then be∣ginneth their auctorite and name to de∣kaye and be minisshed. For do not the cō∣sent of all good men iugd now otherwyse of the pope his cardinals / bisshops / reli∣giouse monkis and preistes then they did of late? Be not menis myndes turned from them? Is not their proude falsely vsurped auctorite worthely blotted out of good menis hertis? The other and his last plage is the losse of his kyngdom / for as did dauid succcede Saul / so do here ye Medis and Peseis succede yt Chaldeis and Assyriens. And this was lo / the ende of the first Monarchye and of so gloriou∣se a golden head. Let all tyraunts nowe therfore ceasse / lykewyse to trust to their owne ryches and power / let them repent themselues of their persecucion of gods worde & his ministers. And thinke that
they maye shortly by some soden chaunce lese their kyngdoms and empires as did Beltsazar lese and leaue his most flouris∣shing empyrre of Babylon vnto the Per∣syes which had as yet in the begininge very lytle power. Also note this thinge / That as Dauid pondred & wayed Saul / as ye see in the psalmes / euen so do the cō∣sent of the crysten congregaciōs in their54. & si∣che lyke psalm is prayers / waye and pondre (as it were in the lances of gods worde) the wyked∣nes of oure present persewers at the com∣minacions of God sainge: I shall viset their iniquite. Let emprour and princes therfore wysely and godly in all fatherly loue behaue themselues ayenst the cry∣sten chirches their subiectes / that they maye be fauoured, and as in the. xx. psal. prayd fore. For yf their auctorite & fauour be lost in the crysten chirches / and they be prayed fore as the Iewes in Babylon prayed for Babylon and their persewers in the. 137. psal. both the emprour / kynges and their kyngdōs are vndone. The last worde Vpharsin signifieth clerely ye king∣dom to be dissipated and skatered & geuen to the Persians / which albeit they werexeno∣phon. helpers to ye Medis (for xenophon playn∣ly denyeth the persone of Darii to be pre∣sent in ye besege therof) yet by his host pre∣sent
with kyng Cyrus / they obtayned the cyte. Wherfore / according to the prophe∣cyes the kyngdom of Babylon was at last translated vnto Cyr{us} that he shulde send home ayen the Iewes out of captiuite to buylde vp their temple / for the which to be done daniel was promoued. Then Beltsazar commanded that daniel shuldbe cled with purpure / and aText. golden chayne hanged aboute his nek / and to be proclaymed the thirde lorde or ruler next him in the empyre.the chir∣che wher∣for it flo∣urisheth more in captiui∣te then at liber∣tye. This place hath an example whereby we confirme / God in the mutacions of kyngdōs / therfore the more to honour his chirche then in peace / that they might conuerte the victores and encrease his chirche emong them. For thorow the ho∣nour obtayned by Cyrus / daniel (as sone as Babylon was taken) begane to be kno∣wen what he was of Cyrus and Darius which aknowleged themselues to haue had wone the cyte by gods fauour. Wher∣fore let crysten congregacions be confir∣med by this example / in perturbacions of realmes / not to fall to the vngodly / but rather to heare cryst sayinge: When ye shall heare rumores of bataill / be ye notMat. 24 afrayd nor troubled. To receyue clothes golde & promocion of kyngs is not synne /
so longe as they be taken to thentent as daniel receyued them. For to the pure allTitū. 1. things be clene / and contrary / to the pol∣luted and infidels all are vnclene / but both the mynde and conscience of these men are vnpure / as Beltsazar honoureth not daniel as the prophete of God but as he wold haue done to any one of his diuy∣nes and spirituall enchaunters and soth∣sayers / nether repenteth he himself / but wold be sene to kepe his promise to saue his princely honor. Whatsoeuer is not of fayth / is synne. And therfore he fallethRom. 14 as it foloweth.Text. ☞ In the same nyght Beltsazar the kynge of the Chaldeis was slayne. This place as it were the conclusion of all describeth the fall and death of the kynge and mutacion of his kyngdome / for his blasphemye and festinge in securite and synfulnes. xenophon wryteth Baby∣lonxeno∣phon. to be taken the same nyght where in the kynge in great securite and confiden∣ce celebrated his fest vnto his god Beel. For Beltsazar in his huntinge / of enuye slewe yt sonne of Gobie / and therfore the∣se two princes or rulers vnder Beltsazar one called Gobiamand the other Gada∣tam / then beinge with kynge Cyrus first entred the cyte and tower of Babylon /
and slewe the kyng / Gobiam being auen∣ged1495. the age of ye first Mo marchie. of his sonnes death. Here is so ye ende of the first and golden monarchye which stode. 1495. yeres and ended in the. 3440. aftir the creacion of the worlde. Wherby all emperours / kynges and princes maye fele it with their fyngers onely god to be the defender of empyres and realmes / so that except he watche ouer them / in vay∣ne are their cites kept. And except he de∣fende them by his aungels / inuayne ga∣ther they tresure / inuayne buysde they blokhouses and municions / inuayne mu∣sterepsal. 126. they and take they vp men. Wherfore I exhorte and monissh yet agene emperours / kynges and princes all that they worship not strāge gods nor yet An ex∣hortaciō to empe∣rours and kyngs. exhibit any reuerent behauior vnto ima∣ges / nether to trust to miche to their tre∣sure / municions and helpe of men & mo∣ney. For here maye they see this golden head of the worlde sodenly for their ido∣latrye / cōtempt of the trwe prechers and for the neglectinge of Gods worde sent them / to be destroyd: but let them worship and thanke God onely the father of Iesu cryste oure delyuerer / & now in these last dayes ye restorer and bringer ayen of his worde of saluacion. Let them I saye wor∣ship him accordinge to his firste and .ii.
preceptis as the psalmes teache them.psal. 2. & .33. The ar∣gumēt. An example of daniels accusers torne of the lyons, is here setforth to fraye all flaterers aboute kynges from euyll coun∣sell▪ geuinge & to deterre them from their false complaynts and maliciouse accusa∣cions of the inoncent ministers and pre∣chers of goddis worde. For in this chap▪ as it were in a seuerall lytle boke concer ninge the false accusers of prophetis and trewe prechers torne in pesis of ye lyons / we see that euyll counsell is the worst of all to the counsellers. But to teache the readers playnely and orderly that they might the easlier holde this golden lytle boke in memory / we will diuide it into. 7. places. The first is of ye office of victours or conquirors. The seconde conteyneth a terrible example of the spiritualte & bis∣shops being in courte and of counsell ste∣ringe emperours / kynges and princes by their euyll counsell vnto persecucion mi∣scheife and wykednes. The thirde hath an example of the constant confessor of gods worde. The .iiii. hath examples of the infirmite and weakenes of fayth and of the persewers of the worde. The fyft hath examples of the wrath & mercye of god. The .vi. hath an euange∣ly proclamacion of kynge Darii.
The seuenth hath the example of a man glorifyed aftir his crosse. DArius Medus being. lvii. yearesCap. vi. olde / toke vpon him the kyngdom / whom it pleased to constitute. 120. gouerners ouer ye hole empyre. Ouer the∣se men he ordined. 3. cheife princes or ru∣lers (emong whom one was daniel) vnto the which. 3. hyghe rulers / the other. 120. shulde geue a rekeninge of their offices / that the kynge might be cased of his so chargeable burdens. But daniel excel∣led all the princes & gouerners / for that he had so excellent plentuose a spirit / wherfore the kynge had thought to haue ordined him gouerner ouer his vniuer∣sall empyre. This Darius kynge of the Medis / xe∣nophonDarus Cyaxa∣res. calleth Darius Cyaxares ye son∣ne of Astiagis / whom Cyrus succeded to raigne ouer the Medis Persis and Ba∣bylonits / and Cyrus was the first kynge of the Persis / and raigned aftir Darius xxiii. yeares / with whom / Darius aftir they had taken Babylon raigned not ful∣ly one yeare. So that kynge Cyrus in all Cyrus raigned 24. yea∣res. raigned. xxiiii. yeres. This kynge Da∣rius / in that he constituteth so godly go∣uerners in siche an order ouer his empy∣re / he techeth all victores and cōquirers
their office aftir their victorie to consti∣tute the polycie and to reforme the chir∣che bringing althinges aftir so greate cō∣fusion in the mutacion / into a beter ordir. For although these two kynges Darius beinge the elder / and Cyrus the yonger / both togyther had taken Babylon / & be∣cause Cyrus gladly (as xenophon wyt∣nesseth) gaue the tytle of the empyre to Dario: therfore do daniel here declare ye empyre to be ordered and reformed aftir this maner of Dario. First he constitu∣teth.A godly ordinan∣ce in kyn∣gdome. 120. gouerners to be sette and diui∣ded into. iiii. or iii. partes of his kyngdom into which parties (as we diuide ours in∣to shiers) that empyre was now diuided. These gouerners were as ye kynges han∣des and eyes / as here aftir ye shall see ye rulers vnder yt kynge of Egypte to be cal∣led his armes / of the which rulers thus sayth Peter: Beye subiect to the gouer∣ners sent of ye kyng. Ouer these sayd. 120. he setteth. 3. cheife ouerseers to take a re∣keninge of these. 120. of the which. iii. da∣niel was as the Archebisshop ouer all. These. 3. shuld ouersee that all the other did their office. And thus was the kyng∣dom peaceably and ordrely ministred / iu∣stice equite and iugement trewly execu∣ted for that lytle tyme / that the chirche
of God might be the easilier reformed. For doutles / Darius enstructe and coun∣selled of daniel, aknowleged this so great a victory to be of god for his chirches sa∣ke the iewes / & therfore Cyrus gaue god the thankis and receyued this counsell of daniel so to order the empyre, and at laste to geue the peple of god, the iews / lyberty to returne and to buyld their temple in Hierusalem. Of this ensample let al cri∣sten kings hauig siche victoryes seke out the counsels of the godly lerned trwe pre∣chers of the worde and aftir their doctri∣ne and counsells order their comon poli∣cyes and chirches so that their constitu∣cions and actis repugne not the gospell of cryste. But see / see how the shade we fo lowth the sonne, and enuye felicite / and howe that lying false thefe the deuyll by his enuiouse spyghtfull spiritualtye lay∣eth a wayte to destroye bothe the prophe∣tis and good kinges. Wherfore these cheif rulers andText. the gouerners studied to fynde some occa∣sion to trappe Daniel in the kynges ma∣ters / but no cryme nor synne coude they fynde in him / he was so faithful and iust that no fawlt nor vnright coude thei fyn∣de in him. Then these men said / we shall neuer fynde any fawlt nor occasiō ayenst

And vpon this / these prei∣stis and gouerners went togither to the kynge saing▪ king darius for euer mought ye lyue. All the princes and lordes spiritu∣all & temporall gouerners counselers no∣bles and officers ouer thy empire and pro∣uinces haue decreed to make a kings law or acte to be proclamed and straightly to be obserued.

Now therfore / oh kyng / confirme the decre and subscribe it that it be not changed / accor∣ding the ferme and perpetuall lawe and custom of the Medis & Persians that no man be so hardy to breake it. Wherfore Darius the kynge subscribed the cōman∣dement nowe writen. Mencion afore is made of the spiri∣tualtye of the chaldeis being euer in so highe auctorite and in counsell with the kyngs of Babylō that in all highe harde & dowtful things they sought theyr coun∣sell & coning at them which be called in ye text / Magi / Sophi / diuini / incātatorsMagi. astrologi fatidici. &c. that is wysemen so∣thesaiers / diuines / charmers / targazars

These wyse menis wysedom & their coning dani. had oftē tymes cōfoun∣ded and made their wisedom folisshnes & their highe lerning vayn lyes and lying vanite / as ye haue sene it before in the in terpretaciōs of Nebucadnezars dreames and visions and now last of all in the de∣claracion of the handewriting vnto bel∣tsazar. Wherfore the enuiouse enchaun∣ters and spyghtfull spiritualty neuer cea sed hunting for occasions to destroye da∣niel. And nowe they seing him in moste highe fauour with these two newe kings lykely to cause them to reforme their fal∣se religion and to bring in the very trwe religion and worship of the very god / con ceyued this deuillishe acte and promoued it vnto these bisshops the ouerseers and rulers of the counsel causing thē to bring it vnto the king / and himself to confirme it subscribed with his own hāde. Which done / thei thought now to haue had trap∣ped innocent Daniel. For the heithen kinges did regarde their actis lawes con firmacions and othrs so highly that thei were with them inuiolable vnable to be reuoked or anulled / so highly regarded

But and if emprowr or king shuld decre by a sacred othe to smite of Iohan Baptistes head or to slaye innocent Paul / then wy thei perswade him siche othes to be inuio ble.

and be ye lerned. Seke ye out sagePsa. 2. daniels, lerned in gods laws to be of your counsell and beware of theise polityke pru dent popish doctours of the popis lawes. For it is highe tyme. But wherfore did Darius subscribe so sone to this decree and deuillissh acte? ve∣rely his spiritualty had bewitched him thus to do. So it was that daniel was in fauour and herde of, bothe Cyrus and Da rius but especially of Cyrus to whom he cleaned most for the prophecies that wēt vpon him out of Isaye to be the restorerIsay. 42 &. 45. of his peple. And Cyrus had daniel in hi∣ghe honour. Nowe was Cyrus but yong whose father was not kinge / and Darius was sage, olde / borne his father being a kinge. And as daniel exceded all the go∣uerners and bisshops in auctorite, so begā Cyrus to excell Darium in glorye. Nowe did his flaterers by the counsell of his sothe sayers and spiritualty perswade  vnto Dario / that althoughe he was Cy∣rus his elder and a more aunciet king of the Medis, comen of a kinges stok & by whose powr and might babylon was wone / yet (if he loked not wel aboute him) Cyrus wolde disapoint him of the title therof & be called king of babylon. This dissimilitude and vnlyke state or condi∣cion
of men is a non the cause of suspici∣ons, hatereds, and discorde / as xenophon writeth Darium Cyaxarē to be offended with Cyrus his glorye new beginning to encrease / & therefore with teares to haue complayned and reasoned the cause with Cyrus affirming himself to be despysed / not withstanding / he was well pacifyed by the meruelouse diligēce and faithful∣nes of cyrus geuing gladly place and pre∣eminence / yea and the title to / of the em∣pireDispari∣lite & fe∣licite brig for∣th enuye & debate in euery estate. of babylon to Dario. And thus craf∣tely brought  the spiritualtye of babylon to passe / that Darius for feare of his auc∣torite, glory, and dignite to be minished or taken from him / of him that nothing lesse thought  / so sodenly and secretly withe out the consent of ether Cyrus or Daniel subscribed this vngodly acte. So sone cā theis craftye courtly wittis and politike popisshe prudēt, fynde out subtyle deceits and fraudes to put out the iust and God∣ly Cyrus of auctorite to let him of his prosperouse successe and godly entent in his realme / and must suffer this vngod∣ly acte to goforthe. Siche ministers euer hath the deuil which can seke occasions craftely to auerte good kings good myn∣dis from the trwth when vnder an highe pretence of office and vertewe / awaite is
layd to destroy them. As here whylis this old king Darius thought to get himself honour aboue Cyrus he thus bewitched perceiued not howe grete sinne he cōmit∣ted in suffering this his wyked acte to be proclamed and subscribed, forbidding the inuocacion of god / and confirming him∣self to be exalted aboue god. This exam∣ple therfore monissheth emprours & kin∣ges to be wyse in obseruing siche decey∣tes and namely in their owne lawes arty∣cles actis and proclamacions to be publis∣shed / lest thei vsurpe gods honour. For xenophon writeth Darium very heuely to haue  takē the contempt of himself & therfore to haue  fallen awaye from Cyrus. Wherfore it was a very easy thig for the deuill by wyked flaterers and wy∣keder counsellers so to inflame Dariū o enacte siche a commandement ayenst the first precept of god / nothing to be asked of any god but of himself & al to obscure the glory of Cyrus and to trappe daniel. For all this drifte of these spirituall enchaun∣ters with their captiued complices the counsellers / was to cause daniel to be tor∣ne in pecis of the lyons. And as these sub∣tile charmere with their crafty courtyers did greuously sinne for that / so deceitful∣ly and subtyly thei toke an occasion / and
with so glitering a pretence of their dew∣ty and vertewe: layd this fraudelent be∣yght for the king and religion / euen so sin∣ned the king in that he suffred himself to be perswaded of these false hypocrits & flaterers / all benefits to be asked of him self as of a god. For the simple olde king sawe it not / that whyls he loked for ho∣nour aboue and ayenst Cyrus / he prohibi∣ted the inuocacion of gods name and ca∣sted down daniel into the perell of his ly∣fe. But what shall godly men do whē that know themselues thus to be vexed & per∣secuted with siche vngodly actis? verely thei must then praye more mightely then before as is folowthe. ☞ But when daniel knewe this com∣mandemētText. to be subscribed / he went into his house / & the wyndowes of his cham∣ber opened towerde Ierusalem / he dey∣ly thre tymes / vpon his knees fill downe thankinge and prayinge and opened his mynde to his god as he was euery daye before wonte to do. Now is there a greuouse bataill bent ayenst daniel by these venomose vepers.Daniel opēli bre∣keth the vngodly But yet in the mean ceason his excellent vertewe shyneth / testifiynge his faith by his constant confession and prayse vnto god. And not onely  he not consent vn∣to
this vngodly act which was diuisedkings wy ked actis ayenst him and agenst God / but he also improueth it strongly & breaketh it open∣ly: settinge open his wyndwes that his enimies obseruinge him / might see him prayng vnto ye god of Israel at middaye. Why daniel? what nedest thou thus o∣penly to haue put thyself in peres? thouThe ob∣iection. mighst haue worshipt god in spirit or se∣cretely and not by these externe gestures haue declared it: or for that space not to haue praid at all. No / not so did daniel / for he knewe that the trewe religion andThe so∣lucion. worship must be farre from all colourable dissembling without any lying shyftis of hypocricie especially in siche an archebis∣shop. Daniel wolde not haue crept to an image of the crosse nor kneled downe be∣fore the kinge askinge any diuyne peti∣cion of him / & then haue colored and glo∣sed it with Winchesters glose sayinge / I maye so do not geuinge the image or the king any godly worship / but a certain vt∣ward reuerent behauiour / now were theThe de∣claraciō of ye solu∣cion & cō firmaciō therof. lxx. yeares of their captiuite past / now it behoued daniel to praye more busily and er neslyer that the peple might returne & buyld vp ayen the temple / & not to haue ceased one hewr. Be prayd to werds ieru∣salem / whom he desyred to be repared / so
that of his gestures thei might know his desyer / he declared it to be destroid of god & of God it must be redified / let not men therfore depende of menis actis and coun∣sels for ye walles of Ierusalem & temple to be redified / that is for the gospell and trwe prechers to be restored abyding em∣prours and princes pleasurs / policyes & their laysour to set forth iustly gods wor∣de / forpsal. 51.

Daniel wolde not dissemble with the wyked act and com∣mandement of Darius / but asked in tyme their delyuerance of god for crystis sake promised. And albeit / thrise in the daye as at morninge / midday and eueninge to praye was commanded them / god to geue vs happy begining / good successe / & well to fynisshe all oure godly affayers with∣out whom we can nether begin nor conti∣new or ende any good thinge / yet maye it

Oh how vehemently prayd cryst / his passion now being at hande? For then / for the confes∣sion and inuocacion of the name of god / the houre was comen wherin he shuld be casten into ye paynfull pitte of deth / well therfore in the tyme of the crosse dothe Paul bid vs praye in euery place / & cryst biddeth vs asweis praye as daniel here praith. Daniels prayer standeth of theseDaniel prayer cō∣sisteth in 3. partis. thre partis / of thankis geuing for his in∣numerable benefits / of prayse for his godly power & miracles shewed for them / and in confession aknowleginge himself and the peple to be synners and god to be trewe & faithfull of his promise in sauing and delyueringe siche synners that thus call vpon him in faith. Cryst in his ago∣nye▪ his disciples praye lest they shuld fall into temptacion / and Paul bid∣deth vs euer to geue thankis to god tho∣row cryste. Wherfore daniel wolde not
dissemble in cssing to pray for the tyme. ☞ Now these men insidiously obser∣uingText. daniel / espyed him praying and ma∣kinge supplicacion to his god Wherfore they went vnto the kinge reasoning with him vpon his acte and commandement sainge: East thou not publisshed an acte decreed in wryting / that who aske any thing of any god or man by. xxx. dayes / but onely of the (oh kinge) he must be ca∣sten downe into the lyons denne? whom the kinge answerd sayinge / yisse trwly. And it must be holden fermely inuiolable aftir the lawe perpetuall of the Medis and Perseis. Then they answerde▪ sayng before the kinge. This daniel one of theThis da niel / was spoken of spight & contēpte numbre of ye captiued Iewes regardeth nothinge at all thy commandements oh kinge: nor yet thy proclamacion which thyself hast publisshed in wrytinge. For thryse euery daye he prayth / which thing the kinge hearinge / was gretly heuey for him. And thought playnly to haue delyue∣red daniel / & studied vnto the sone going downe labouring hardely for his delyue∣rance. But these men so insidiously co∣minge to the kinge told him. Thou must know it (oh king) that the lawe of the Me∣dis and Persies is / that no acte / no com∣mandement or lawe made of the kinge
maye be changed. Then at the kings cō∣mandement Daniel was brought forth / and thei did caste him into the lyons den. Then the kinge spekinge to daniel sayd: Thy god whom thou hast euer worship∣ped delyuer the. And ther was brought a stonne and layde vpon the mouth of the denne which stonne the kinge with his owne seallor ring and with the signet of his nobles sealed / that there shulde no∣thinge els be done ayenst daniel / or left his will shuld be changed in daniel. Here haue we an example of a weak simple olde kinge bewitched / deceiued and ouercomen of his gosily flaterers and of his owne polityke counsellers. Now ye see the great diligence of these enuiouse hypocrites / ye see their decei∣tes / vnmerciles murther / and ingratitu∣de. Daniel was now a right venerable sage olde father more then. lxxx. yeares olde well deseruinge and paynes takinge to profit euery man / so that worthely he might haue bene called pater patrie / the father of the hole lande. But all his be∣nefites / his vertewes / his innocencye / nor his reuerēt sagenes might not moue these maliciouse magos to refrayne them selues and to pitie him. Onely go they aboute to destroye the man / & all because
he worshipped god onely and no man nor creature. These be the venemouse spy∣ders which creping into euery fayer flo∣wer of the garden gather nothing els but present poyson. Now behold their sleigh∣thy poyson. They come to the kinge / not first of all accusinge daniel / for that they knew the kinge loued him so intierly: but they first trapped the kinge in that they preassed so sore vpon him with his owne lawes and actis aftir the lawe of those nacions in nowyse to be broken or chan∣ged / the kinge once confirminge them. They reasoned with him of the inuiola∣ble fastnesse of the acte and decree / vntoOf la∣wes and actis. which / the king no siche thing suspecting as they went aboute / anon graunted. And verely to speke of laws & actes / the∣re is nothing so necessary to comō wealis and kingdoms to be conserued as the ho∣ly obseruacion of good lawes. For they be compared to an hedge or pale which kepe of euyll beastis frō the good gardēs, which if they be broken downe in any pla∣ce / an ingresse is open to all euyll denou∣ring beastis. Or if ye law be once or twyse dispensed with / anon it ceasseth any mo∣re to be a lawe. Plato compareth lawesPlato. to pillis medecyns or pocions / which if ye syke bodye teuomite / there is no helth to
be loked fore. Wherfore in good▪ lawes & actis there behowueth to be a certayne diuyne auctorite. Who wold bere awer∣de which nether to kutte nor to smyte is nothing apte? To conserue lawes and to nourisshe iustice, is ye swerde geuen from god aboue. And therfore be lawes called holy / because it is not lefull to breke thē: but they be ferme and immoble. The la∣wes are aboue the kinges / as Darius he∣re confesseth. It were the most indigne and detestable thinge that good lawes shulde be subiecte and vnder euyll men. For yf the lawes be godly and good / he fighteth ayenst God that breketh them. Of this thing is the kings scepter a ve∣ry apt signe and token / in that it is ferme and inflexible. Which thinge the iewes well vnderstode when thei / to deryde cry∣stes kingdome / his auctorite and lawes / Mat. 27. gaue him a reede in his hande wauered with the wynde / signifyinge that incon∣stant kings must make wauering & weake lawes to daye made / tomorow marred. But these enuiouse enchaunters did wy∣sely dispute with Darius of the solidite & fastnes of his lawes making the king in∣feriour to his lawes. But fulwyked was their deceyte to thruste into his head so vngodly and so dampnable an acte for a
good lawe / which the kinge shulde haue reiected vtterly. For by that acte both ye king was dampned and daniel his wy∣sest counseller destroyed. This their mis∣cheuose fraude at last espyed of the king / (but all to late) he labored the hole daye to saue daniel / but all inuayne / for the ri∣gour of his lawe preuayled for that (as these subtyle serpents had perswadid it) it was not lefull for the king to violate it. Oh how pertinate and styfe are the vn∣godly lawers & act makers in their owne wyked lawes to be conserued? What ex∣cuse shall ye bringe / oh ye false lawers / and brekers of gods holy decrees cōman ding you nether to put to nor to take away any thinge from his worde? Haue ye notDeut. 12. Mat. 15. Isay. 29. red, alledged of Cryste so solemply this graue sentēce oute of I say saying: Inuay∣ne do men worship me with menis tradi∣cions and doctrynes? And here is to be noted / that lawes be made for diuerse causes as some / that by their obseruacion / god might be worsshi∣ped. These laws of nomā els then of god himself may be made: Noman ought to chang them / as be these. Onely god must be worsshiped & loued aboue all / owr her∣tis must be kept clene from hatered / aua∣rice / adultery / from crueltye that it be a▪
worthy habitacle for god. Which fulnes of this lawe cryste when he came accom∣plisshed it for vs. For with these laws / of faith & innocencye god will be worshi∣ped: vnto these whoso adde or take frō thēPsal. 18. he is accursed. These lawes make perfit the inward man▪ yet ar there other laws made to gouern the peple & their howses which if thei be not preiudice to faith &Lyuil laws. charite / alb eit men make them / yet muste we kepe them as gods lawes for the auc∣torite of the magistrats sake whom God hathe institued. But and if these humane lawes loke to destroye the crysten lyber∣tye / to combremēs consciences and to op∣presse the glorye of cryste, God forbyde that ether for flaterye or fore feare we shulde iuge or thinke them to be compa∣red with gods lawes or to be suffered of a∣ny cristiane to stande. A lawe is not abro∣gated but stablesshed / if the entent and mynde therof be kept. What so euer is a∣yenst the lawe of god / it is no lawe nor iu∣stice / but tyrannye and vngodlines. And if it be made fiercely to rune vpon menis sowlis / so is it the more pestilent then it shulde hurte menis bodies or take away their goodis. Manis laws therfore ar ap∣proued so long as thei kepe them with in their owne bowndis / so that god be not
worshiped with them / but let them serue the peace & not obscure the glorye of god but plante honestye. But retourne we to the text. Then at the kingis commande∣ment &c. Grete difference was there bet∣wixt the sinne of the king and the crime of daniels accusers. For the king sinned of weaknes and simplicite, deceyued of these maliciouse murtherers / but his ac∣cusers accusing of enuye the seruant of god sinned ayenst the holy gost. And ther∣fore the king a non was smyten with re∣pentance and pite, bewayling the deathe of daniel / seking ye best wais he coulde to saue him / and whē he could not / he gaue place to his wiked accusers / excusing & also condempning himself and Daniel to He confessed daniel to serue god whiche was able to delyuer him / nethelesse yet he condempned him. But wherfore did the king thus tmpt god to delyuer him / seing himself might haue delyuered him the king had great compassion on him / e∣uen miche lyke pilate, pronowncing criste an innocent and yet gaue sentence vpon him to be crucified. But what an offence was geuen to the iewes to see daniel the iust casten to the lyons / whilis other wyked were herde & praised: Onely the king excused him / & yet himself destroid
him / for he was a fraid for lesing of his gouernance. And there was brought a stō ne &. c. That the miracle might be the cle∣arer / god prouyded / the mouth of the den∣ne to be sealed with the kings signet and with the signet of his nobles that thus conspired his death / that non shuld su∣spect Daniel to be delyuered by any ma∣nis helpe as to haue casted in to the lyōs any other meat. Thus was christis sepul∣cre sealled and kept that the miracle of his resurreccion shuld the euidentlier a∣pere. The last sentence of the text is. That there shuld nothing els be done a∣yenst daniel / or thus / lest any thing shuld come to daniel contrary to the kings will By which sentence it is ment / that the kinge perceyuing daniels enimies cruel∣ler then the lyons / & so if the lyons shuld spare Daniel yet wold he be sewer that his accusers shuld not open the mouthe of the denne and destroye daniel by any other meanis. Dan. therfore now dwel∣leth emong lyons but with faithe in god is he defended / as hathe the pistle to theCa. 11. hebreus. Faith stoppethe the lyons mou∣thes / and thus is he brought ayen to that first dignite of Adā created vnto the ima∣ge of god to haue dominion ouer all bea∣stis / for euen the cruell lyons testified da∣niels
innocencye, whiche the most wiked rulers were not ashamed to defame: now was his tēptaciō & crosse at the higheste and therfore in tyme doth god helpe that we and al faithful by his example shuld lerne in our most perels to trust and bele∣ue in god. Lyke ensamples of goodmē pre∣serued from beastis hath Eusebius the. 9 boke of the Ecclesiasti storye. Thus haue ye an example / the chirch of god not to want persecucions / and that the myndes of Princes shalbe craftely snarled and bewitched of their deuillis∣she counsellers. This example therfore monissheth them to be wyse in obseruing siche deceit and namely in their lawes ac∣tis proclamacions &c. to be publisshed: lest thei vsurp gods honor. Here is set for∣theWeake faithed. an example of a weake faithed king betwixt whose sinne and the sin of the persewers of crystis ministres, we ought diligētly to discerne. He is weake faithed which loueth and enbraceth the trwe do∣ctrine / wold promoue it / suffreth himself to be enstructed and studieth to profite there in and desyereth the techers to be preserued / and confesseth the trwth in a maner / albeit he dare not defende it open∣ly and frely enoughe nor strongly / nethe∣lesse he nether denieth it nor persecuteth it.
Siche weake persons Paul biddeth vsRo. 14. receyue iently / addig that god receyueth him and may confirm him. Siche weake ons were the apostles at crystis death. For verely cuē thus doth god gouern his faithfull that thei shuld aknowlegde their infirmities / oute of which aftir grete and many batails betwixt their feble flessh and the spirit thei might come forth ther ofwith victorye.  herfore Isay saith a smoking match god wilnot out quencheIsay. 42 psa. 144. and ayen. The lorde lifteth vp all that fall / and putteth his hand vnder them that theibe not hurte. Euen thus was da∣rius weake. For he receyued the doctrine he had mynde to defende it / he confessed it / he wold haue promoued it with his te∣stimonye and confession / which all were tokens of a godly mynde. Nether douted he therof / but of his owne powr to spread and to st it forthe he douted. For he was thus demented and bewitched with the∣se pestilent perswasions of his wiked ru∣lers as thus saying. Consyder oh▪ king) thou art but one mā and ignorant of this mater / thou must geue faith to the lerned doctors and so the sayers whiche be euer at the goddis mouthes and at  han∣dis / in the nwe and soden mutacion of these realmes it is to hard for the to plāt
any new religiō & to abolish the olde cu∣stoms. It wil gender sedicions and vpro∣res and miche inquitenes in thy realme / put away therfore these new lerned with their new letning / or tarye tyla more qui∣ete tyme, tyll it may be beter borne of your commons and lordis. Siche enimies to god and his worde shall good princes ne∣uerwant. Thei laid ayenst the king the ferme auctorite of his actis & lawes say∣ing, it shulde be a perellose example and to boldean enterpryse to make any inno∣uacions and changes of the olde religion laudable customes rites cere. &c. At laste therfore the king ouercomen by the impor∣tune wiked perswasions of these peruer∣se coūsellers permitted to them their mis∣cheuouse dryft. Nethe lesse a cristen prin∣ce ought to haue a princely & manly her∣te in gods cause and of no weaknes to ge∣ue place to his maliciouse magistrats & priestis. Be ought himself to take the bo∣ke of the lawe in his own hād / to studye & be lerned aboue all his Magis bisshops and counsel to. But because this king sin∣ned not of a set purpose willingly / therfor a non was he smiten with pitie and repen∣tance / but so were not the false accusers of daniel and the wiked counsellers. It folowth therfore that the king repented
with so manly a faith that he punisshed these accusers and his coūsellers of this perellouse nouite and mutacion put into his head so vngodly. Wold God all em∣perours and kings wold practize this Da∣rius his example. Thei be persewers which nether loue / Perse∣wers. nor will heare / nor reuerence the true do∣ctryne / nor will suffer themselues to be taught / nor study to profit therin / nether will defende the teachers and prechers thereof / nether suffer it to be setforth / which themselues know it to be trwe and godly. But had leauer to bury and burne it and bringe it into hatered and sclaun∣der. Let these men thus synninge ayenst the holy gost loke neuer to repent / but to haue the present iugement of God ouer them. And these dampnable wretchesTitū. 3. Paul biddeth vs aftir once and the se∣conde warning to esie we as heretiques / for thei be condempned by their owne te∣stimonye. Let kings therfore by Darius his example aknowleg their infirmities and studye strongly to go forthe with the verite / & pray with him that sayd: LordeMar. 9. I beleue but yet helpe my vnbeleif. ☞ Then the kinge going into his pa∣lace went to bed souperlesse / no meat brought him / he slept not that night / as
sone as it was daye syght the kinge arose & went spedely to the denne of the lyons / and beinge therat / he with a moorninge voyce called daniel sayinge: Oh daniel the seruant of the lyuing god / hath not ye power of thy god whom always thou hast worshipped, delyuered the from the lyōs? Anon daniell answerd the kinge sainge / oh king euer moughst thou lyue: My god hath sent me his aungell which hath clo∣sed vp the lyons mouthes that thei shuld not hurt me. For before him am I foun∣de innocent / nether ayenst the / oh kinge haue I cōmitted any fawlte. Then was the king excedengly ioifull and comman∣ded daniel to be plukt out of the denne / in whom now plukt out, there was no hurte founde done to him of the lyons because he beleued in his god. Then at the kings commandemēt were his accusers & eni∣mies brought forth / which wt their chyl∣dren and wyues were throne into yt lyons whom ere they coulde come to the floer of the denne / the lyons toke them / & bro∣ke all their bones. The cruell vnreasonable lyons were meker to Daniel then his owne felowes. The merciable kinge gote mercy of god and repented: he departed from these his wyked counselerswith great heuines / he
refused all meat mirthe and solace consy¦deringe his so faithfull a counseller and seruaunt of god thus to be entreated. Of this example maye some of oure bisshops and some Crysten princes be asshamed / themselues in all delicat excesse & weal∣the to see daysy the innocent blode shed for the trewth & their subiectis for their salfgard, and defence of their realmes to be slayne / themselues in the mean tyme playing and banketing. Daniels wordis to the king thus teache him. Oh kinge / of this mayst thou lerne the iustice of god / before whom I am founde innocēt in this mater and haue not offended the. I had trewly offended the greuously / yf I had worshiped yt with my peticions & prayers for so had I confirmed the in thy nowne synnes▪ making the to beleue thyne acte to haue bene godly. Now the king af∣tir his repentāce and gladnes cōceiued / beginneth to igiustelyer / he comman∣deth the innocent to be drawne out from the lyōs & his false accusers to be throne vnto them. And for because they went a∣bout to deprrue the kinge of his most wy∣se counseller & best beloued frende / ther∣fore did the kinge iustely punisshe these false accusers with their beste beloued wyues and chyldren. But wherfore was
daniel delyuered? Because he beleued / (saith the text) in his God. I cannot se els now a dayes wherfore men be perse∣cuted and brent, casten into oure lordely lyons mouthes, but because thei beleue in their God one alone for all sufficient / for their faith onely in him to be iustifyed, of him onely to depende / to him onely to praye / him onely to call vpon &c. & vpon no saynt nor non els to worshippe / no not images. It was nether the kinges repen∣tant heuines / nor his fastinge and wat∣ching / nor yet daniels innocēcie / nor pray∣ersAn exā∣ple to be noted & folowed of kin∣ges. that closed vp ye lyons mouthes: but it was cryst ye messager of his heuenly fa∣ther / because daniel beleued in him. Here be emperours and kinges taught to retract and call in ayen their vniust lawes / actis articles / decrees and proclamaciōs / & to punisshe the counsellers and auctours of siche actis. Which ensample all hinges ought this daye diligently to loke vpon. Also all siche vngodly actis and lawes we be bounde with daniel to not obey / but rather to flye out of the lande then to be yoked with them. Sely innocent daniel was casten into the lyons / signifying the innocēt poore chirche of god euer to haue the most song empreours / kings and prin∣ces and the deuyll to, withe the pope and
all his lyons to be hyrperswers. To be breif. Darius and daniel be serforth to vs the example of the mercye of god / & da∣niels accusers are thexample of ye wrath of god. The example of Darius first tea∣cheth the office of a crystiane to repent, to beleue, and to aknowleg his synnes af∣tir the lawe and gospell / and to saue the godly & dampne the vngodly. The kinge without meat and sleape all the daye and night continueth. For the lawe is as it were a fyery veper euer bighting / euen yt comminacion of god saying: I shall viset thy synnes: for the kinge ayenst his faith and consciēce had commanded daniel to be destroyd for kepinge the first precept of god. He thus commanded it / not as the king and lorde / but as an idolater & mur∣therer of innocents. But the kinge to see daniel a lyue conceiued no lesse▪ mira∣cle in his conscience then was the delyue∣rance of daniels bodye. Greate therfore is the ioye of ye faithfull / aftir their crosse thus to se god to preserue & glorifye them. Then king Darius vnto the pe∣pleText. & nacions all tongues vpon the vni∣uersall erth thus writeth. Miche peace be with you. Of me it is decreed that in all the parties of my realme all men shall feare & dreade the god of daniel / for that
he is the lyuing god abyding for euer and euer / for his kingdom shall neuer be de∣stroid but his dominion euer must endu∣re / who helpeth and delyuereth▪ he she∣weth his wondrefull miracles in heuen and erthe whiche delyuered daniel from the lyons. Aftir this daniel was highly promoted in the kingdom of Darii and in the realme of Cyrithe persiane. See how God will haue the victorye? see vnto what ende God hath permitted these iniuries to daniel. The kinge wold be puft vp with glory. His diuines & no∣bles flater him / the iuste is casten to the lyons / & god the iuge of all is not knowen But now at last his glory is declared cle∣rer then the sonne. And the kinge with pu∣blyk rescript and open recātacion confes∣singe his synne, setteth forth the glory of god. Nebucadnezar commanded that the name of God in nowyse shuldbe blasphe∣med. Darius here willeth it to be feared and worshipped and all men to tremble and feare at the face of the god of daniel. As though he shulde saye: Let oure actis & lawes / decrees or proclamacions whe∣ther thei be of myself or of any other ma∣de / bynde noman / if thei commande any thinge ayenst the god of daniel. For my∣selfe at last haue I lerned wherto lawes
be holy and when thei shuld be dispensed with / Miche more iust it is that God be rather obeyed then man. I am but a man mortall dust and asshes. It is God that lyueth for euer which punissheth and re∣wardeth. His face feare ye / him serue and reuerence. He lyueth and raigneth pre∣sent when men thinke him to be absent. And awaketh when he is thought to slea∣pe. Who wold not haue despayered of da∣niels lyfe▪ And yet so / for his faith is he delyuered from the lyons hongry mou∣thes / let vs folowe thinges certain and leaue lyinge vanities. Many miracles hath god done in heuen and earth / but of this one maye we be taught his power and goodnes. Now the king rebuketh his errour and the holy prophet before con∣tempned / he exalteth into greate glory. And taketh daniel with him into the lan∣de of Mede leauing Cyrum and his sone Cambysem at Babylon. Thus wolde god aftir the crosse glorifye his seruant. The lyons signifye the mighty enimyesThe ly∣ons. of crystis chirche / as hath the Psal. My soule lyueth emong lyons. Of god onely for oure faith in cryst oure delyuerer / are their mouthes & tyrannouse power stopt, And as cryst then in the forme of an aun∣gell preserued daniel / euen so now being
man and intercessour before the father / he with his present spirit preserueth his chirche in the middis of these lyons his cruell enimies. Here be we lerned none to be exalted of god onelesse he before be casten down into the dennes of lyōs. Forpsa. 109. Rom. 6. cryste might not lifte vp his head except by the waye he had dronken of the roring ryuer. Nether shal the cristians aryse vn∣to lyfe eternall except thei be first dead and buried. Whoso euer therfore thou be thus for the trwth accused and hand∣led as daniel, not onely se that thou thus singe vnto thy god (whilis thou be est me thou makest me great) but also haue thou faith and confidence, knowing the same shortely to be fulfilled in thy accu∣sers and persewers that cam vpon dani∣els accusers. Thei shalbe trapped and ta∣ken in their owne snares & fall into ye pitt whiche themselues had digged vp: But I (saith the faithfull shall passe by▪ harme∣les. How can we want these examples in the congregacions so ful of consolacion? If Daniel be diligently red ye shall see him to haue bene the fygure of cry∣stis passion and his glorificacion by his resurreccion. This story of Dary also ought to be set before all the princes eyes of the world to teache them repentance
to beleue / to professe the trwth, to reuoke their errours, and false and vngodly la∣wes, actis, articles, constitucions and in∣stitucions or enstruccions / to cōserue the trw worshipers and beleuers, and also to se that all their chirches haue good pre∣chers of the worde / whiche is the cheif of∣fice of euery kinge / and to see thē brought vp in the very trwe enstruccions and do∣ctrine of cryste and his apostles. Nowe to the seconde boke of daniel and seuenth chapter. NOwe daniel returneth bake. 3. yeresThe ar∣gument of the ▪7. teching vs not what other men / but what himself did see to come vnto the worldis ende. What changes of king∣doms and what persecucions the chosen shuld suffer vntil the eternall kingdom of cryst shuld come to vs. He telleth here the vision shewed to himselfe wherbye he prophecieth the affliccions of the pe∣ple of god vnder the 4. Monarchies to be suffred / and how that the Romane empi∣re at last diuided & shaken in here erthen feble feet, anticryste inuading Chrystis chirche / shuld persecute it vnto the worl∣dis ende. And at last cryste comen to iuge∣ment shuld destroye him: that the faith∣full with cryst (all their ennemis taken a∣way) might reigne and dwel in peace for
euer. In this 7. chap. the same thinge is shewed which was sene of Nebucad. in the. 2. chap. albeit vnder other wordis & in another forme or vision / saue that he∣re daniel clerely prophecieth of the secla∣re Anticrystis / of the popis / Mahumetis and of the Turkis Antichristen kingdōs to be sprongen vp out of the Romane em∣pyre. Let vs heare the text. In the first yere of Beltsazar kin∣geText. of Babylon daniel had a dreame and aChap. 7. vision of his head in his bedde. Whose some he wryteth in these wordis. I da∣niel sawe in the night / the fower wyndes of heuen fyghting and makinge great cō∣mociēs vpon the great sea. And. 4. great beastis one ayenste another were ascen∣ded out of the sea. And the first was lyke a lyon hauing egles winges. And I loked vpon him whylis his wynges were pluc∣ked from him / and himself casten oute of the lande: but yet standinge on his fete erected lyke a man / and a manis mynde was geuen him. And beholde / the secon∣de beast was lyke a bere standing in the one syde / hauing. 3. morsels in his mouth betwixt his tethe. Vnto whom they sayd: Aryse and deuoure thou miche flesshe. Then yet I loked / and so I sawe another lyke a leoparde hauinge. 4. swyft winges
on his bake / this beast had. iiii. hornes / and vnto him was geuen power to rule. After this I loked in the nyght / and be∣holde / I sawe the fowrth beast / a beast fe∣refull and terrible / and meruelouse stron∣ge / which had great tethe of  / he deuoured and consumed / and the leauin∣ges he trode vnder his feete. This beast beinge lyke non of all the other former / had. x. hornes. This vision sene in the night with so many cruell beastis so fyghting vpon the sea is ferefull / signifying the chirche of God to suffre affliccions and greuouse persecuciōs vnder the. 4. monarchies la∣boring in the derk ignorance of god & his worde. This lyon signifyed the golden head & kingdom of Babylon vnder whom the peple of god especially those. lxx. ye∣res suffred greuouse affliccions. A lyonThe lyō of Baby lon. is a cruell beast yf he be exaspered / and gentle yf the man faldowne naked before him / & except it be in great honger he hur∣teth not, siche humble prostrated proyes. He is without suspicion and fraude. Vn∣to this lyon or kinges of Babylon therePlinye. were sette egles winges / for that thei we∣re swyft vnto all their affayers / yea & vn∣to blodsheding in batail. The same king∣dom in Ezechiel is called the fower for∣med
beast / first lyke a lyon for their har∣dines / in subdewinge their aduersaris / & lyke an egle / for their swyftnes in their businesses / lyke an oxe for their constan∣cy in labours to be sustained / and lyke a man for their prudence in things to be a∣fore sene. The which condicions kinges and magistrates ought to haue. Of this lyon sayd Ierem. 4. There is comen vp a lyon out of his cowche. Innumerable af∣fliccions suffred the Iewes vnder this lyons blody tyranny / as themselues com∣playn saying: Vpon the floudis of Baby∣lon we sate and wept whyles we remem∣bred zion. This lyons. 2. winges were the two peples of the Chaldeis and As∣syrians. They were smyten of / & the lyon csten out of the lande / when ye Persians subdewed them. To be then eleuated to stonde vp as a man, signifieth that king∣dom in Nebucadnez. & his sones dayes to be exalted to ye knowledg of God / & their kingdom therby to be glorifyed. But in fi∣ne / the mynde of a fraill man was geuen to it in Beltsazar / which in his beastly se∣curite perisshed & lost ye golden head & so bolde a lyōs propertie. In siche olde fygu∣res men may see yet present exāples / for the verite correspondeth the fygure vnto ye orldes ende in a perpetuall verificaciō
By the bere is signifyed the Persi kingdom a beast lesse iently thē the lyon / and especially in his olde age when he is most chorlysshe gredier to deuower and very false / wherfore in scripture for hisProu. 18. cruel auaitlaing he is ioyned with the lyon.

Also the other kings of Persye aftir Darium eacted of the iews great tributis. This denouring bere with his 3. morsels in his

This deuou∣ring Persi bere not onely shed miche blo∣de / but she persecuted cruelly crystis chir∣che.Orosius lib. 2.

This fowrth ferefull Romane beast is described terribly / hugly strong / armedThe last beaste is the Ro∣mane ē∣pyre. withe tethe of deuouring and tea∣ring fleshe and bones euen the same that is sene in the 2. chapter called the leggis of whose fete were partely & parte potbakt erthe. For what els signi∣fie these wordes, with so terrible a sownde then the empyre of Rome not onely with the most harde batails at home and with out, of themselues and of strangers, to be consumed and destroid / but also the same most cruelly to persecute crystes chirche and to destroye vtterly and irreparably the iewes policye for euer and their naci∣on. By the leauings or remenants / vnder∣stand
the laste parte of this monarchie / his fete signifye the laste emperours of it. This beast to trede vnder his fete the lea∣uings / signifyeth / the later ende of this kingdom to haue the most crueltyes and calamites brought ouer it by ye pope / and at last by the turke. For how greuonsly hath Italye bene torne and rent almoste these. 900. yeres / of the Gottis / of the gre∣kis / longobards & of owr empero wrs? But why is this beast vnlyke al the other for∣mer? verely this empyre must dure lōger then the 2. and the thirde monarchy and all the vngodlines and persecucion done distinctly and seuerally in the tother / shalbe gathered to gither and committed of this beast. And the laste emperours and popis of this empyre shall vexe and per∣secute the chirche longer & cruellier then any of the other. His 10 hornes signifye the cheif pro∣uincesThe. 10. hornes. Iob. 29. Mat. 2 and realmes vnder the Romane empyre. Which were very many. For the nownber of 10 signifieth a great multitu∣de as in Iob. See / ten tymes that is gre∣atly ye haue confounded me. And Cryst lykeneth the kingdom of heuen to 10 vir∣gens. So that the meaning is / that the Romane empyre shuld haue amplier and moo prouinces then the other former. O∣rels
take the 10 hornes / for Italy Spay∣ne France / Germany / Illyrik / Grece / Af∣frik / Egipt / Asia / Syria. For the countri∣es annexed vnto these 10 must be rekened with them / as Pannonia adioining to Il∣lyrik / and Macedonia ioined to Grece. ☞ And whylis I consydered these hor∣nesText. / lo / there grewe vp another lytle hor∣ne amonge them of whom. 3. of the former hornes were plukt out. And beholde ther were hornes in this horne as the eyes of a man and a mouth speakinge stoute and great thinges. This lytest horne was and is the Anti∣crysten kingdome of the popes of Rome with all their vnclene clergye by lytle & lytle at their begininge creping vp from so low a state into so hyghe dignities / po∣wer and possessions vnder themperours, and their. x. other hornes / sowen oute of the serpents sead into euery corner of the worlde / flyinge lyke locustes into euery emperours and kinges bosome ether to be their confessers / counsellers / prechers or teachers: out of pore scoles and cloysters are these beggers cropen vp aboue em∣perours and kinges by their serpentine fla∣tering fraudes and holy hypocrysie. And as daniel here seeth. 4. beastis ascendingApoc. 13. out of the sea / so doth Ioan, resoning the
same vision see the same beast arysing vp lyke wyse out of the sea. But the cruell for∣mes and facions which daniel sawe in yeDaniel cōpared with the Apoca∣lypse. Apoc. 17. thre beastis / the same altogyther seeth I can in this one hugly beast sayng. And the beast whom I sawe / was lyke a leo∣parde / and his feet as beres fete / and his mouth lyke the mouth of a lyon. He seeth him also with. y. hornes / which he ex∣powneth to be. x. kinges / which had not yet in Ioans dayes receyved their king∣doms / but shuld then in tyme to come / as kinges in an hower take their power. For sone aftir by the fraudes of this lytle hor∣ne the empyre of Rome was (as ye see it) diuided into feet and toes / as Nebucad∣nezar did see it to come / which is & shal∣be the uine and fall of the hole empyre. Of this diuision and skateringe therof / Paul in Neros tyme gaue (as it were) a watche worde and warning before sayng He that holdeth the empyre / let him hold it fast now yet a whyle / tyll it be taken a∣waye.2. Tes. 2 For euen then / saith Paul / was he working his secrete anticrysten mischief and wykednes. In somich as Ioan anon aftir Paul sayd. And euen now are their many anticrystes: which are gone forth1. Ioā. 2. of vs / but yet were thei non of vs. Lo here maye ye see this beast to be no stranger /
borne farrof / for Paul saith / he sitteth in the temple of god / he is therfore a dome∣sty enimye, a tame beast not to be sought among the Turkis / Iewes and Saracēs as oure bisshops wolde make vs beleue whylis themselues play this beastis, par∣te vnder oure noses at home in the tem∣ple of god / and not in the temples of the Turkis and Iewes. They tell vs / where the head emperours and kings be crystened and thei of their counsell and teachers / ther can be no persecucion by Anticryst / but all is iuste execucion / lo. But Iohn & daniel saye that he shulde putforth his hornes vnder the winges of all the other crysten kinges euen amonge crysten men in the chirche of cryst / in crystis name against cryst his name and his faithfull to make bataill. Here it apereth Iohn to say the same that daniel saith / but yet in other wordis. For where as in this pla∣ce daniel sawe a beast armed with. 3. gre∣te teth deuouring and consuminge all / the same did Ioan see takinge his ty∣rannye / cruell power / his prowd seat and his mischeuouse maiesty of the dragon ye deuyll / beinge a blody murtherer and a lyer from the beginning. Agen where Ioan speketh of the beastApoc. 13. with. x. hornes / he addeth to him another
beast ascending from the erth sene of him to haue two hornes lyke a lambe / but he spake as did the dragon / & executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. The. x. horned beast ascending out of the sea is the spirituall Anticryst of RomeThe spi rituall anticrist hauinge himselfe wt all his lawes / rytes / tradicions / decrees and doctryne defen∣ded of the emperours swerde and with the swerdis of all these kinges once geuen to drinke of his golden cuppe of poyson. Amonge these his stronge defenders and mighty hornes he arose first / but a lytle horne / vntyll they deuolued vnto him their powers possessions and autorities to slaye the sayntis / and then was he a mighty worthy. x. horned blody whore of Babylon. But at last / the gospell once re∣ueled / it did pluk from hir head hir ho∣ly vysare of hypocrisy and gaue hir in hir most hyghe and holy head a deadly wounde: had not his cardinallis / bishops and fryers strewed into euery emperours court and kinges hawlis / spedely putto the plaster in rolling and tossing the ball ayen vnto the seculare powers flatering them with the popis tytles / power / pos∣sessions / & auctorite to maintayn and de∣fend all the popes ceremonis / tradicions doctrynes more sewerly confirmed with
the seclare emperours actis and articlesThe bea∣stis woū∣de hea∣led of his ow∣ne spiri∣tual sour∣gens. & defended with swerde and fyer cruel∣lier then euer they were vnder the pope himself. For the healing of this wounde one horne was called the most sacred ce∣sar / another the most crysten / another the most catholyke / and another his first be∣goten some / and another / defender of the faith &c. Which clerkely cure of the cler∣gy when Ioan had espyed / lo / sayd he / I see another beast ascendinge oute of theThe se∣clar an∣tichrist. erth with two hornes / &c. meaninge the seculare antichristen emperours and kin∣ges hauing now two horned powers / both their owne and the spirituall auctorite / as they had first / and all to persecute the gospell now of late offred them and to burne the professors and prechers therof. And it is to be feared / lest the Turke be also this two horned seculare Anticryst ascended out of the erth. For I dare say: That rather then ye gospell shuld be frely receyued and the pope with his spirituall sourgens be brydled or suppressed with ye worde of God / their state and lyuing cor∣rected & reformed there at / the emperours and kinges crystened / consenting and cō∣pellinge these lytle whorishe hornes to daunce aftir the poore painfull pype of ye gospell / they had leifer ten. Turkis to
inuade (and yf their selues bringe him not in) and to raigne ouer all crystendom / then one crysten kinge. For they had ley∣uor be vnder Mahumet and his lawes / then vnder the crysten kinges and em∣perours and vnder the holy gospell of cryst For vnder the Turke / they yet conceyue some hope ether by tribute geuinge / or by their olde hypocritish holy flatering frau∣des to stande styll in their dignites glo∣rye / ryches / possessions and auctorite. But in both these beastis their cruell hor∣nes are encreased (take them for whom ye will) for both the Turke and Mahu∣mete in Asia and Aphrica / and the Pope with his false prophets and falser cardi∣nals and bishops with all their coniured and sworne seculare papistis in Europa / haue goten them a mighty perello{us} power ayenst cryst is poore fely lambes as ye see in their commandements / decrees / arti∣cles / actis and proclamaciōs and inqui∣sicions for bokis & heresies as they call goddis worde / to be prohibited pressed downe / & burned with all the promouers therof / vnder the Turke thei haue some hope to stand styll in their lustes and ple∣sures / but vnder the gospell of cryst they be lyke to lese all and their kingdome to haue a miscrable fall.
Before this / daniel sawe the last Mo∣narchie which was the empyre of Rome to be diuided into many kingdōs as per∣chaunce into France / Portugal / Spayne Pole / Denmarke / Englande / Hyerlande Scotland / Napels / Boheme and Hunga∣rye / which be the. x. hornes / and sene of Iohn / by the. x. hornes / helping the read Romishe beast to suppresse the kingdomeApoc. 17. of cryst. For by the popis policies / thus was the noble empyre skatered into hir owne destruccion / that this lytle horne might haue the proye and preeminence ouer the hole empyre. This lytle horne saith daniel grewe vp amonge these. x. kingdoms or. x. seculare hornes / by who∣se ayed ryches and auctorite / the pope wt his prelates ascended from poore bugger∣ly beggerly fryers and flaterers vnto si∣che an imperial maiestye aboue emperours and kinges. And here daniel seeth. 3. hor∣nes smyten of from these so many kinges by the lytle horne / That is / the Anticry∣sten pope to make weake and feble what∣soeuer emperour and kinge he listed / depo∣se them at his plesure and to translate ye empyre and kingdoms into his owne net∣tis to vse and occupy them himself. Or if ye will take the. iii. hornes prescisely for. 3 empires or kingdoms falsely vsurped of
the pope / beholde vpon his head the tri∣pleThe. iii. hornes casten downe of the pope. crone infaming himself to be the thro∣erdowne and destroyer or robber of thre great kingdoms / yea and euen the subuer∣ter of the hole Romane empyre. Netheles his flaterers yet make him beleue that he is emperour and kinge ouer haeuen / ouer ye erth and of purgatory / yea and ouer hell and deuyll to. But this is trewth. He on∣ce translated the empyre from the east to the weest / and from the Frenche men to the Germans. And now contendeth he to translate it to the Turke / which shalbe his last translacion & his owne destruc∣cion with the heuey mutacions of all the west kingdoms / yf he can bring his blody purpose to passe. For Daniel saith this lytle horne to haue eyes lyke manis eyes / that is to be prudent and polytyk to loke for his owne ease & lucre. For he thinketh to gett more vnder the Turke then vnder the gospell yf it be receyued of the emperours and of all the crysten kings as he feareth it wil∣be. Iohn geueth him hornes lyke a lambe That is to saye / he shall do all his frau∣delent featis vnder a meruelouse preten∣ce of holynes innocencye and mekenes. For he shall wryte himself the most holy / when he shall shewe himself by his dedis
to be ye most wyked prophane cruell wolue comen in shepis clothes / for vnder ye tyt∣le of Papa: father of fathers he is ye most marciles tyrant of all tyrants / vnder the name of Summi or Maximi pontificis / that is of the most hyghe and greatest vi∣gilant watcher and ouerseer of his flok / he is the most negligent idest idoll & do∣me dogge / vnder ye name of pastor / which is a flok feder / he is the most pestelent poysoner. And euen these be the two . hornes signifyed by ye two forked bis∣shops myters / althoughe (say they) they signifye the two testamēts / and that thei be lerned in nether of them bothe. Nowe when ye see this beaste to deuolue theise his holy tytles and godly names of in∣nocency and meaknes to any seclare hor∣ne or beast ascending out of the erth / and the same do take them, executing the Po∣pis power and tyrannye in persecutinge the gospell and to confirme papistrye, spe∣king / wryting / decreing / articlyng & enac∣ting &c. as did the dragon / then take heed for then contendeth this beaste to heale his awne deadly head wounde agene. The two hornes lyke lambes hornes be both the powers seculare and ecclesiast ether in any one spirituall or in any one seculare Anticryst.
Also it is to be noted. That bothe Daniel and Ioan saith he hath a mouthe speking great blaphemies / or prowd arrogancies ayenst god / he shall speke as did the dra∣gon euen blaphemies ayenst god / as did he that said I will ascēde and belyke the most hyghest god. And as did the serpent perswade Eue to not beleue god but to thinke the most trwe god to be a dissem∣bler or a lyer. The turke and Mahumet speke gret blaphemies ayenst god in their alkaron. But owr litle whore of Rome & hir cardinalls bishops and prechers spe∣ke the moste gretest and greuoust blasphe∣mies of all and themselues defende them with fyer and cause their seculare anti∣cristis to defend them with swerde. Thei be not ashamed to wryte and teche the po∣pe to be of syke powr with cryste / the pope cannot erre / the pope to be the supreme head and spowse of the chirche and vica∣re of cryste. And because he hathe the em∣periall powr / he may distribute the king∣doms and ryches of the worlde as he lyst and because he is the hyghest bysshop he maye geue all the chirches benifices as cardinallships bysshopryks and benefi∣ces to whom he lyste / and he bosteth the gospell to be subiecte to his interpretaci∣on and vnderstanding / yea & except (saye
some of owr bishops) that the scripture be confirmed by siche ordinary powrs / it is no scripture nor may not be redd, but of si∣che as thei lyste to delyuer & lycēce it / nor in any other tongue then thei liste to geue it vs. He will haue his lawe and tradici∣ons to be obserued aboue gods laws and the transgressours of his lowsey lawes to be greuouslier punisshed then the bre∣kers of gods precepts. He bosteth himfelf to make lawes and articles of owr faithe and to adde mo sacraments to them then cryst made / and to consecrate and to ma∣ke the body of cryste / to sende awaye the substance of the bread / the accidents as the whigtnes rowndes / tast & other qua∣lities & quātities remayning. He confes∣seth crist with his lippes to be a red emer but yet he techeth / he dothe and writeth many grete blaphemies contrary to the mystery of owr redempcion / as in his pur∣gatory / satisfaccions / merits  and siche other. All these blaphemies speketh he vnder lambes skinnes in an innocent holy pretence, hauinge hornes lyke a lambe / he will apere humble lyke any o∣ther inferiour man & yet shameth he not to open his mouth to speke greuouse blas∣phemies ayenst god and his peple. This2. thes. 2. beast Paul handleth, and his pestelēt pro pertyes
he treateh saying. This sinfull man and forlorne chylde, aduersary to god will be exalted ayenst god / and aboue his worship cleame and vsurp a worship to himself and teche a certain vtwarde re∣uerent behauiour to idols and images, so that he will sitte in the temple of god ostē∣ting and bosting himself setforthe for a god / that is / he will with his lawes, decre∣es, actis, articles, and doctrine sitte deper in menis consciences & more feared then god himself with his ten cōmandements and all his terrible comminacions. Is it not an heauy blasphemye to teche, wryte, and decree that himself may with his fyer and swerde preuent and disapoynt god of his euerlasting and immutable pro∣uidence? But at laste / when the litle hor∣nes iniquite is disclosed / then shall he a∣yenst his wil render ayen his prossessions titles & his falsely vsurped auctorite to ye seclare hornes, out of whom first by frau∣de and hypocrisie he so craftely extorted them. Th{us} ye see that by this litle horne & by the horned beste sene of Ioan, be vn∣derstandē the Anticristen aduersaries of cryste and his chirche, whether thei be the seclare kings and emperowrs, popes or bisshops / turke or Mahumete or these all togither coniured ayenst the lorde & his
anointed. It is more then two thousandThe dif∣ference betwixt the turk and anti∣crist. yeres sence daniel sawe these visions / wt albeit the fathers by this litle horne vn∣derstode rightly anticryste / yet because althingis then to come in these propheci∣es / were not sene so clerly as thei be now paste / & in fulfilling in these owr present dayes sene & felt of euery faithful / some men coniecture / this litle horne to be the Turke / albeit the popis and their prela∣tis haue iustly played the turkis parte hi∣therts. For the turke and anticrist differ∣re not but as the deuil differeth from hel By this litle prominent horne therforeIoā dra∣conite. Doctor Iohan Draconite vnderstandeth the kingdom of the Saracens / of the tur∣ke and of Mahumete sprongen vp in the dissipacion of the Romane monarchie / wt we will (saith he) confirme by daniels de∣scripcion / of the tyme / of the place / of the powr & doctrin of this saracene Turkish kingdom. Of the tyme / for when the Ro∣maneThe tur kes king dom whē it bega∣ne. empyre begane to beskatered, mini∣shed and febled euen almost down to het erthen toes / then began the turkis king∣dom to growe and floresshe which was aboute the yere of cryst. 613. When the frē∣che men gote fraūce / and the longobardsOf the place where it ne. Italy and mahumete in the tyme of he∣raclius the emperowr moued his sedicion Of the place / daniel seeth this litle hor∣ne
plucking vp; of the former hornes / wherby doutles he signifieth / the Roma∣ne prouynces then lying in the east to be fallen from the empyre / for these; hornes that is to saye; kingdoms Egipt / Siria / and the regions of Cilicia / the Saracēs had then anon ioyned togither. But albe∣it now the turkes haue many moo prouin∣ces yet is it not ayēst the text▪ describing onely but the beginning of the Saracēs or turkis kingdō. Of his powr / for dani∣el saith. These; hornes were with greatOff his powr. violence pluckt out / oh it is to trwe / that hole Aphrika / a great parte of Asia / and not litle of Europa be holden this daye of the turke and of his Tartarion god ma∣humete.Ezec. 38. and 39. Ezechiel prophecieth / this fyer∣ce Scythi beast and pestilence of all cry∣stendom / in the laste age of the worlde to destroye the chirche and at last to be de∣stroid in the mountans of Israel / that is ether in the places where the gospel sow∣neth, or of those knyghtis whiche calv̄pō the name of the lorde god in faithe. OfOff his doctrine his doctryne. Daniel saith that this hor∣ne hath the eyes of a man & a mouth spe∣king grete and stowte things which if ye wil see / reade his Alcorane: which who∣so desyere to know I shal geue him in this to reade / that he may know that this de∣uills
nills mouth Mahumete vtterly abolis∣sheth all the writings of the prophets & apostles euen the testimonies of owr sal∣uacion and helpe. He fayneth cryste to be no beter then Moses / and in nowyse will he aknowleg him to be the sauiour. And if he hath any cyuile iustice yet is it corrup∣ted wt abominable filthye lecherye. wher∣for / because not onely with swerde & we∣pens he decreth the sayers & doers ayēst his wyked doctryn to be destroyed but al so he wilbe extolled aboue al thig called god / therfore is this litle horne thought to be no litle parte of anticrists kingdom. Hitherto hath Daniel prosecuted his own visiōs of the succession of the 4 em∣pires / & that the image in ye 2 cap. & those 4 beastis here signifye not onely ye secula∣re emperowrs and king is fighting among themselues one ayenst a nother and all ayēst god / but also the spirituall anticryst persecuting the chirche of cryste. For the later kings shall moste cruelly trede dow∣ne the gospell in hir vprysing as ye haue sene it these 600 yeres paste, whilis thei with their emperowrs plaid the popis hāg∣men excersing their own tyrannye & exe∣cuting his cruell vngodly lawes and an∣ticristen doctrin by burning & slaying whi∣lis thei prosecuted his and their own hor∣rible
blody desyers vpon crystis chirche for the defence of the popis & their own tradicions rites and articles actes &c. to confirme their idolatry and supersticiō For so hath this litle horne bewitched hir 10 hornes about hir / that she hath per∣swaded and put into their headis, the ho∣ly scriptures in owr vulgare tongues to be heresye, and the faithfull fre prechers heretiques, and therfore to banissh and burne them bothe, and to bring into the chirches, bisshops bokis of new and wy∣ked institucions and vnholsome erudici∣ons with their owne arrogant actis ar∣med articles with swerde and fyer. Thethe trew token of the chir∣che. cheif and trwest token of the trw chirche is the profession and preching of the pro∣pheticall and apostoli doctryne. And to fight ayenst this doctryne or to abolissh it / is the very signe of anticristes Syna∣gog. The pope and his seclare sorte vsur∣pe a powr and worship aboue cryste / in that with the most arrogāt audacite thei dare alter / interprete, adde, and minishe and expowne gods lawes and gospell at their plesures and to be siche lordis ouer his faith and religion / that of gods holy perpetual verite & mighty worde thei wil aftir their owne carnall affectis, to serue their own lustis, make it a nose of waxe
to warme and fede their synful desyers▪ yea gods worde and gospell is not gods worde except thei so admitte and allowe it. It is heresy / nw lerning yea and trea∣son to / the worde ofsedicion and disobedi∣ence if thei so saye it. Oh blody blasphe∣mers / oh arrogant anticristes. Be not the∣sea compa∣rison of ye Mahu∣metes do∣ctrine & of the po∣pis. your prowd mouthes speking prowd & horrible blasphemies? The turke & Ma∣humete vtterly renownce all that in the gospell techeth cryste to be the fone of god / and euen so do thei that wilbe iusti∣fyed by their own merits: mahumete kno∣weth not the doctrine of faith or of ye trw inuocacion and worship / nomore do the spirituall & seculare anticristis whiche yet do persecute it / onely do Mahumete & the turke holde with owr anticrystis cer∣tein ciuil precepts / at their own pleasurs (as do the called crystians) to stablissh & to abolish them when and  thei liste: but yet is the turke more constant and ci∣uily iuste in his lawes then be the called cristians. The turke and his Mahumete grawnt sinful lecherose lustis / owr turke and Mahumete winke / yea thei laughe at the same / forbiddig iuste matrymony / and rending in sondre lawfully maried persons and permitting open whoredom. Mahumete with violence of swerde com∣pelleth
men to his religion and the same do owr Mahumetis. Now seeth euery man / this mighty hor∣ned beast to be the triple anticristen king∣dome standinge vpon the popis and their  ergy / vpon the seculare hornes dron∣ken with his cuppe / and vpon the Tur∣kish Mahumet. But this lytle horne dif∣fereth from the ten hornes in that it hath eyes lyke a man pretendinge all religion∣se deuocion and holynes in his doinges, wrytings, and sayings: for vnder the pre∣tence of a reformacion defence and resto∣ring of the crysten religion / he wold de∣stroye it / and settle Anticryst the faster / which property Ioan expresseth sayinge his hornes to be lyke  hornes for that vnder shepis and lambes skynnes he shall hyde himself lurking a blody yō & a fyerce bere. The vtwarde behauiors of the Turkis in their temples & lyuinge semeth godly. Thei praye fyne tymes a daye / thei vse diuerse sprinklings & was∣shings as we do with holy water / thei en∣clyne moste deuoutly when they praye / thei lye prostrat / thei abstayne from wy∣ne / thei eat their meat vpon the grounde thei will haue no curiose nor costly how∣ses / thei viset the temples oft / thei abhor∣re vnclennes / thei lothe and detest ima∣ges /
wherin thei be miche beter then the called crystians. Who seinge this their deoute religion in sight wolde not take them for godly men without gall and ar∣rogancye? Lykewyse in the papisti chir∣che / what a multitude & variete is there of laudable, in syghte, ceremonis / decent rytes / what continuall praying / singing / playing of swete instruments / dayly  sing? How outragiously are their preistes and chirches orned and gorgiously gar∣nisshed in their popetry passe tymes and apes playe▪ what is there in gold / syluer / and in costly aparell / as apes in purpure how iette thei? How many festiuall hygh dayes to worship saints haue thei made themselues to call poore men from their dayly labours and lucre, to serue their id∣le belys to stand and wonder vpon Io∣ans camell cote, and to gaze & stare vpon these apes in golde / veluets and preciou∣se stones and vpon their vayne pictures and idle images? Beholde their habits / vestures / shauinges / hypocrisye / chosen holynes / fayned & facioned demure coun∣tenances / holy okes / and humane eyes / and thou woldst swere / them to be rather aungels (I say not of sathan) then men. But the prophet addeth / that as in ye hor∣ne there apereth to be an honest eye and
a lambish loke / so hath he a blasphemou∣se mouth / speking great arrogant things which Ioan expowning saith. He shall speke as did the dragon and deuyll him∣selfe / to obscure Gods glory and his holy name / tyll with the brethe of his mouth he be slayne. Wherfore to counforte vs here yet molested & persecuted with these cruell hornes. Daniel sayth. ☞ But yet I behelde / vntyll the che∣yersText. and stoles were sett / and the man ofApoc. 1. &5. Exo. 24 many yeares was setdowne / whose ve∣sture was as whight as snowe / and the heare of his head as fyne and pure as woll / whose seat royall was all on a fye∣rie flamme / and the whelis thereof bur∣ned lyke fyer / and there went longe fyery beames lyke a floude offyer flouwing out of him / & thousand thousands ministred vnto him / and ten thousand thousands stode before him. And anon as he was set downe to iugement / the bokis were layd open. Hytherto ye see all daniels vision ve∣refyed concerninge these. 4. beastis and monarchies and this lytle horne / so that we nede not to seke any other exposicion of daniels and Ioans visions / then the dayly experiences in beholding the face of the worlde which is a playn commen∣tary
vpon them both. And of the present verefying hytherto and fulfilling of the∣se visions / we maye be certain and sewer that the rest of their prophecies shall ve∣rely come to passe shortly / ere these seatis be sett downe / and these forked horned kings trones be taken awaye. For verely cryst is euen now preparinge these iuge∣ment seatis / to destroye these wyked An∣ticrysten hornes & to cast them into per∣petuall fyery tormēts / and to enbrace his chosen thus cruelly of these beastis op∣pressed receiuing vs vnto perpetuall ioye For this is / lo / the ende of this tragedye / thus gothe out their playe euen then whē thei thinke to be but in ye middis of their mater. For daniel and Ioan both knyt vp Anticrystis raigne in half a tyme or in half an hebdomade conforting vs in that they shalbe shortly taken awaye / & shall not vexe vs so long as they thinke to do / wytnes the psal. But thou oh lorde shaltpsal. 54. pluk them downe into the pitte of death / euen these blody men & crafty deceiuers which shall not come to half the dayes wherein they thinke to lyue to execute their mischeif. And agene. When thoupsal. 91. seest these synfull blody men florishe lyke flouers / then be thou sewer / themal to flo∣risshe for no nother ende then for euer to
be smyten downe. And therfore sayth da∣nielVse. 12. aftir some textis. He shall take his plesure for a tyme for tymes and but for half a tyme. And Ioan windeth vp the halfe tyme in half an hebdomade / which be. iii. ycares and an half / for God is not angrywith vs always / but in the middis of their wyked course his aduersaries shall fall downe into their owne perpe∣tuall destruccion and payns. For daniel sawe the dayes of oure tribulacion shor∣tened for our counforte / and for their con∣fusion that trouble vs. There shalbe no full ende of oure persecucions and tribu∣lacions nor of the Turkis crueltye vntyll cryste sett downe his seatis to iugement wherin we shalbe blessed and the vngod∣ly persewers of crystis chirche dampned for euer as Paul conforteth the martyres of Thessalonie. And therfore ye prophets vse but fewe wordis / for ther is no worde2. thes. 1. &. 2. of god so lytle / but it is mightiet then all the worlde / nether any so lytle a letter in the prophetis which sauoreth not ether of the lawe or of the gospel. Wherfore be∣cause it is certayn / that of daniel the de∣scripcion of the iugemēt / is here setforth into the consolacion of the crystians and into the feare of the Anticrysten / we will (that the troubled chirche might see hyr
confort) saye our mynde breifly according to the scriptures of the iugement of cryst▪ These seatis are sayd to be sette / for yeMat. 19. confort of them which yet suffer for the gospels sake vnder these horned kingdōs as cryst tolde his apostles sayng: ye shall sitte vpon the twelue seatis to iuge the twelf trybis of Israel. And yf we suffer with cryst / we shall raigne with cryst.Rom. 8. Cryst is called here the great aged God and man / for he is an eternall sauior pro∣mised in paradise before he was borne. To sitte / perteineth to cryste the iuge as in Matth. 25. Be shall sitt in the trone of his glorye / & before him shall all nacionsPaul Ro viii. be brought. Forthermore / a iuge hath a double office (as saith Peter) to punisshe the euyll and to defende the good. Wher∣fore here doth Daniel by the whightneshis whit clothes. of cryste his vesture and purenes of his heare describe his confortable defence of the good men. For as he in his whight clothes clarifyed in his transfiguracion and also rysing from death apered ioyou∣se and glad to the heuey penitēt synners / euen so shall he make glad his glorifyed chosen once rysen from death with this voyce: Come ye yt blessed of my father &c. Siche a beutye of the chirche in cryst is paynted also in the. 45. psal. but it is not
sene in this miserable vale of weping te∣res / as Ioan sayth / we be not yet sene as we shalbe. The heuey vengeance of theRis flā∣mey tro∣ne what it signi∣fieth. Ioel. 2. euyll men is paynted by ye flammye trone & long fyery beames procedinge therout. For deuouering fyer shall go before him / and a burninge flame aftir him (Ioele to wytnes) and as cryst arysing was sene so terrible to ye kepers of his sepulcre / euen so shall he apere a ferrefull iuge to all vn∣godly in the last iugement saynge / auoyd fro me ye cursed into eternall fyer. Also ye multitude of mynisters is taken for his infinite noumber of aungels as Mat. 25. saith: all the aungels shall come downe with him. To sit in iugement is to rendre to euery one accordinge to their dedis as speketh Paul: Nether is it any thing els / the bokes to be opened / then that Paul saith. In that daye god shall laye open yeRom. 2. secrete hid thingis of menis hertis by Ie∣su1. Cor. 4. cryst according to my gospell. Wherfo∣re there is no difference betwixt daniel and Paul saue that as they both wrote not in one tyme so did they not with the same wordis expresse the same iugement of cryst. Then I behelde / namely for theText. voyce of those stoute great word is whichApoc. 17. 16. &. 20. the horne spake / and I loked so longe tyll
the beast was taken awaye and his body slayne and the beast casten into the fyer. But the  other beastis yet left deposed their power / & to them was there graun∣ted longer to lyue vnto their prefixed tyme. Hytherto haue we treated the descrip∣cion of the iugement into the consolacion3. docu∣ments. of the chirche militant. Now shall ye ler∣ne. iii. thinges in the declaracion of this prophecye. First he teacheth vs not to be offended / nor in oure trouble to cast away all hope / seing these anticrystis the pope with his coniured hornes / and the Tur∣ke with his Mahumete thus to prospere in their mischeif. Secondly he therfore threateneth death and destruccion to all these anticrysten beastis. At last he con∣forteth the chirche beinge yet as a shepe apointed to the slaughter howse with a newe descripcion of crystis coming. For what (thinke ye) shalbe the ende of this oure troublose tragedy? shall we be thus euer persecuted? shall these sharpe & he∣uey hornes always goore vs thus cruel∣ly? will not god come once downe and de∣clare his rightwysenes? will he neuer auenge the iniuriouse oppressions & per∣secuciōs of his iuste and chosen chirche? Aftir oure many and greuouse afflicciōs
daniel seeth a newe and greate change. I loked / sayth he / namely for that arro∣gant great voyce of so blasphemouse wor∣dis which the horne spake. I merueled whether god wolde leaue so great wyked∣nes vnpunisshed and wolde neglect the glory of his name. He wolde not so long suffre it in Sennacherib / he punisshed it anon in Pharao / he was anō euen within Goliath and with all his blasphemers in tymes past. And shall he now suffer thus long his chosen derely beloued to be thus cruelly for his sake brent and slayne and his gloriouse name thus so spight∣fully blasphemed? Daniel loked vpon ye long pacient suffering of God / not once turninge his eyes from him vntyll he sa∣we his iugement at hande / and the iuge∣ment seatis set downe. We may not ther∣fore behold the onely tribulacions of the iust which may sone thrust vs into despe∣racion: but we must sett the iustice of god before oure eyes / & wayt for the apointed happy helpe in tyme of tribulacion, promi∣sed vs and the greate rewardis prepared for all that iustely fight in his cause. Da∣niel merueled to what ende the false doc∣tryne and prowd wordis of anticryst wold come and where at last he shulde abyde. He sawe that in the last ende of ye worlde
these Anticrystis shulde haue in their af∣fayers great prosperouse successe the em∣perours and kinges to bring home gloriou∣se and happye victories: the pope to ga∣ther home great ryches noble victores hyghe and solempne tytles, and his doc∣tryne and lawes to be fered greatly and receyued ouer all crystendom / emperours and kings mightely to assist and defende them. He sawe the Turkis dominion to sprede mightely and his doctryne to take place, wyde and euery where. With these prosperouse successes / many men / what for weaknes / what for hypocrisye / what for fere and the anguisshe of their perse∣cucions, be auerted from the gospell of pe∣ace vnto these anticrysten actis / articles false doctryne / popish rytes / supersticio{us} ceremonies and vnto their deuyllish tra∣dicions and many vnto Mahumets mis∣cheif. Wherfore he premonissheth vs to be consiant / and to hold fast in mynde the last iugement / that is / the glorye of the godly to come and the paynes eternall of the vngodly / so resting vpon godis wor∣de in oure feruēt prayers that for the gre∣tenes of the euerlasting ioyeand felicite / we maye nothing fere ne regard the infi∣nite troubles of all oure lyfe. Hytherto lo∣ked Paul when he sayd: I thinke not theRom. 8.
sufferings of this lyfe to be wortheily cō2. Cor. 4 pared to the glory to come which shall be reueled in vs. Now will we speake of the cōminacions cast vpon these beastis. Where Daniel saith / I loked vntyll I sawe the beast slayne and his body smy∣ten downe dead and casten into the fyer / and the power of the other beastis there left / taken awaye / he threateneth not one∣ly to this last beaste the empyre of Rome with his spirituall Pope his hole bodye and all their. x. helpinge hornes agaynst the lorde and his anointed, euerlastinge death and destruccion / but he also in the∣se wordis threteneth the same miserable ende vnto ye Turkish or Saracenik king∣dom / for the lambe shall haue the victory as it is wryten in the Apoca. 17. &. 19. chap And I sawe the beast and the kings of ye erth and their hoostes gathered togyther to make warre with the kinge of kinges and with his hoost / but the beast with his false prophetes were taken &c. where Ioan expowneth ye bodye of the beast to be his holy cardinals bisshops / doctours / pre∣thers / his cananized saynts and miracle makers to deceyue the peple / and all the smered preistis hauinge the beastis mark which haue worshiped the image of this beast. Also in the. xx. chap. The deuyll is
casten into a ponde of fyer and brimson where the beast and hir false prophet shalbe tormented daye and night for euer This beast so perissheth that there folo∣weth nomo / aftir him. But the rest which haue their powrs taken from them / or de∣pose them / shall yet lyue with their poste∣rite folowinge them for a lytle tyme not so sodenly to fall as their head hornes. For the laste of all is this fowrth in the which aryseth this lytle horne with his impes and in which the Turke also per∣secuteth vntyll himself with Mahumet and their hole anticristen bodye be slay∣ne. In the other kingdoms yet left, aftir ye Turkis and popis be in destroyinge / all∣though the kinges dayly perish and lese their dominiōs / yet shall their subiectes obtayne fauor with their ouercomers and lyue their apointed yeares / but when the iuge shall sittdowne / both the euyll kin∣ges with their euyll subiectis shalbe ca∣sten into the pitt of fyer. Wherfore ye aun∣gell epowneth it sainge: And they shall take awaye his power, scater, and desiroye it in the ende prefixed of God. And this is the porcion of the cuppe of the vngodly which had leyfer folowe antichrist then cryst. For God shall / as sayth Paul / take awaye all princelynes, powr, and might.
Wherfore this comminacion of god pro∣phecieth vnto all the kinges and peple from the beginnig of the worlde fighting agyenst the gospell of the almighty God and of oure sauiuor Iesu / euerlasting fyer onlesse they repent as the. 2. psalme war∣neth them. Also (lest any man shuld thinke the lyt∣le pore lost shepe of cryst, euen the chirche of god to be vtterly and for euer deuoured of theis bereslyons / leopardes and euen of the terrible beast the Turke) Daniel saith that the tyme and houre is prefixed vnto euery one of them all. That is to saye: It is decreed in heauen how long euery one of the kingdoms in earth shall stand and how wyde they shall sprede. Hytherto semeth it Paul to haue loken when he sayd. God made out of one blodeAct. 17. all man kynde to dwell ouer the vniuer∣sall earth and hath prefined their consti∣tuted tymes and hath prefixed the lymi∣tes of their habitacion that thei shuld se∣ke God. Now is it shewed how long the lyon shall rore / howe long the leoparde shall crye with open mouth / and the bere how long he shall grone and crye. There yet remaineth the ende of these terrible beastis the pope and the Turke euen the kingdoms which yet stonde ouer Germa∣nye
ouer Turkey and ouer Crystendom / to be destroyd by the last daye of iugemēt. Which thinge albeit / it be wryten of da∣niel into the consolacion of the catholyk chirche / yet maye we wepe and wayle to see the gospell thus troden vnder fete in all the vniuersall worlde. Tell me where the gospell shyneth in any part of Aphri∣ca? where in ye great part of Asia? In Eu∣ropa / vnder the Turkis emperours / & po∣pis emperys there be here and there chir∣ches / but they be so cruelly oppressed that nether good letters nor lerning maye flo∣rissh nor ye chirches maye haue any god∣ly teachers. But what profiteth it to com∣plaine? Sewerly this mystery of the cros∣se was setforth in the sone of God anon fro the beginninge of the worlde and is yet so confirmed with the examples of allGen. 3. &. 4. holy men that no consolacion maye be geuen to the chirche besydes the coming of Iesu cryst the sone of God and man. Wherfore (because the powr of the Tur∣ke cannot be lyke the Romane empyre ne∣ther shall he occupye all Europe (for da∣niel denyeth any fyfte Monarchye to co∣me) we shall breifly expresse the wordis of daniel touching the cominge of the so∣ne of god for oure consolacion. Cryst ther∣fore shall come lyke the sone of man / for
because he shall iuge almen he shall be seCryste shall co∣me lyke the sone of man. Ioan. 5. ne as a man of almen. This confirmeth he saying. The father hath geuen powr to iuge vnto his sonne / because he is the sone of man. And therfor it folowth in the text. And beholde / for in the night IText. sawe in the cloudis of heuen one comingChrists kingdō. Ioan. 5. lyke the sonne of man / which coming for∣the, was brought vnto the great aged and he gaue vnto him powr glorye & the king∣dom / that all peple / nacions and tongues shuld serue & worshipe him / whose powr is an euerlasting powr / neuer to be abo∣lesshed / for his kingdom shall neuer be de∣stroid.1. Cor. 15 The sone of man to come to this great aged one / is the same that Paul saith cry∣ste to delyuervp his kingdome / that is / the chirche of his chosen vnto his father whiche geueth to cryste powr glory and a perpetuall kingdom euer to raigne with his electe as the Psalmes of Dauid de∣clare him and his kingdom. Also the same that cryste saith Ioan. 5. And his father gaue him powr to iuge because he is the so∣ne of man. And to be breif cryste shall ve∣rely thus come shortly to iuge the perse∣wers of his chirche and to delyuer ye god∣ly as himself describeth it Mat. 25. let vs
therfore procede. At this vision / I daniel trembledText. in all my bodye & my mynde went fro me for feare / insomiche that I went to one of ye standers by, asking him the very trowth in all this mater. Which tolde it all vnto me / and expowned to me the hole vision sayinge. These 4 beastis figure 4 kinges to a ryse vp or out of the erthe. And the hi ghe holy faithful shal receiue the kingdō and obtaine it for euer. Aftir this I desy∣ered to knowe the certaintie of ye fowrth base whiche so greatly differed from al the other / namely in that he was so fere∣ful / armed with tthe with his cla∣wes of stl deuouering and tearing into peces, & the reste he trode down with his feete. I desyered also to knowe what mēt the 10 hornes in his head / and to be certi∣fied of that litle horne growing vp vnder them / and of the 3 hornes smiten oute fro∣me the former hornes. And of the horne that had menis eyes and spake so great and sowte thingis / and why his forme and loke apexed sowter then the other. And that I sawe this horne to make ba∣taill with ye holy faithful and triumphed & preuailed ouer thē vntill the olde aged came / and the iugemēt was geuen to the highe holy faithfull & the tyme perfixed
was come that the faitfull shuld obtaine and receyue their kingdom. And then he tolde mo thus. The fowrth beast fignifi∣eth the fowrth kingdom that shalbe in ye world whiche shall differe from all the o∣ther kingdōs in might and powr for that it shall deower the hole erthe and breke it all to powlder. The 10 hornes signifye 10 kinges to aryse out and to spring vp out of this beast / and after them there shall a∣ryse a'nother litle one distinct and migh∣tier then the former. For he shall oppres∣se and castedowne 3 kings. For he shall speke at the syde of the most highest god or speke on his parte of diuine things. But the highe holy saitis he shall tangle snarle or destroye. And shall arrogantly take vpō him to change tymes and lawes which shalbe put in to his handis whe∣ther it be for a long or any shorte tyme. Then aftir shalbe the iugement / and his powr thus taken from him / he shalbe vt∣terly slayne and destroid. But the king∣dom powr and ample maiesty vnder the hole heuen shalbe geuen to the holy faith∣full peple of the most higheste, whose rai∣gne is eternall and all the highe powrs shall serue and obey him. And here he en∣ded his wordis. But I daniel had many a grete and troublous thought / so vehe∣mently
was I troubled that my chere & my fauour was clene changed. But yet reserued I this thing in my herte. Now haue ye the exposicion of all this vision as it is afore expowned and nowe declared by the aungel which was cryste himself / wherfore it nedeth not to tarye miche vpon this place saue onely to de∣clare the confession of our faith therin & to confirme the aungels exposicion by ye other places of the scripture. For in that daniel at this vision was so troubled / as∣ked one of the by standers / and so fast re∣serued the aungels wordes: we ought to lerne this doctryne of the vision of these 6. kingdoms / that is to say of the 4 Mo∣narchies / of the anticristen kingdom / and of the kingdom of cryste / to be reuerenced & receyued as the worde of god & the trwe vnderstāding therof to be asked of cryst ye messager of god / and not for the crueltye of these beastes and hornes yet persecu∣ting the chirche to fall or once swarue frō the kingdom of cryst which is the gospell but to contempne all the miseries iniuri∣es and troubles of this lyfe yea and euen death it self for crystis kingdōs sake. Of crystis iugement to come Ioan also saithApoc. 4. and. 20 he sawe a seat sette and 24 cheyers for the 24 eldres &c. For albeit cryst be the
only iuge wc of his father hath receyued all iugement / yet shall the apostles asiste him hauing their trones. And therfore saith he here. And the iugement was ge∣uen to the highe holy faithfull. Cryste is called the olde aged / for a iuge ought to be a graue sage man of long experience. Whom Ioan called the lambe slayne frō the begining of the worlde / and the wor∣deIon. 1. which in the begining was with god: so that we may see that the prophetis a∣knowleged cryst euer bothe god and man his whight vesture sheweth him to be ye most iuste and incorrupt iuge without spotte / and himself in a gloriouse victory ouer syne death deuel and hell to be sene ioyouse and counfortable to his faithfull To cōfirme his old aunciet sage grauite he sawe his heares pure as fyne whight woll / hore headed pretende grauite and wysdome. His flammey seat casting forth long strykes of fyer signifye that god is a terrible consuminge fyer to the vngodly. For Ioan sawe him wt a two edged swer∣de procedinge out of his mouthe / for that his sentēce which he shall there pronoū∣ce shall be sharper and depelyer persinge thorow / then any two edged swerde in se∣paratingHebr. 4. the stinking gotis from the pure innocent lambes. Here Daniel seeth the
same swerde lyke a fyery floude flowinge oute of Crysis mouthe whose vehement myghty heuey sentence ouer the vngod∣ly / no horne may resiste. Then cometh he forth in his hyghe maiesty accompanied with his infinite noumber of aungels so that non of these hornes be able to resist him / but the wyked shall tremble and qua∣ke desyeringe the mountans to fall ouer them to hyde them from his fyght / for he∣reof is he called the God zabaoth that is the god of hootes. The bokis to be laydRom. 2. open / are the consciēces of euery man ac∣cusing or excusinge them. For they shall haue their factis in mynde freshly / open∣ly sene / wherfore they be worthely con∣dempned.1. Cor. 4. For that greate daye shall ma∣ke opene the secretis of euery herte. For when it shalbe sene who be set on ye right hande and who on the fyfte / then shall all fraudes / hypocrcye / tyrannye which yet be taken for rightwysnes / godlynes and zele / be layd open / then shall Anticrystes blasphemyes and persecucions be iuged and punisshed as ye see in the text: when cryst stode before Caiphas to be condemp∣ned / heMat. 26 tolde them the same that the aun∣gel here testifyeth. That aftir this youre false iugemēt / ye shall see the sone of man sittinge on the mighty right hand of god
& coming vpon the cloudis of heauen / &c. in which wordis he did put ye scribes & bis∣shops in mynde of this scripture of daniel but he tolde his tale to deffe men / for it was as miche to saye to them / as this. Now I stand before you as a man mortall to be iuged / but here aftir ye shall not so see me standing / but coming vpon ye clou∣dis of heauen / so that ye be now warned before of my iugement to come ouer you / trwer and iuster thn yours. And where he sayth: That the iugemēt shalbe geuen to the holy hyghe saintis and ye tyme re∣fiyed that they shulde receyue the king∣dom / and aftirward this kingdom powr and ample maiesty to be vnder the wholl heauen / it is the same that the Apocalyp. and I saye speke of the newe heuens / ele∣mentsIsa. 65. Apoc. 21. 2. Pet. 3. and earth / euen the same paradise vnder ye skye vndefyled wher vpon right∣wysnes as Peter sayth / shall euermore dwell / vpon that earth of the lyuinge we shall triumphe ouer death & hell and An∣ticryst singinge: Death where is nowe thy syngel Hell where is thy victory: oh thou forlorne beast where be thy. x. hor∣nes: where is thy seculare swerde and ar∣me? where be both thy horned seculare & spirituall powrs? are they not now broken into dust and thyself with thy hole bodye
of bisshops and cardinals and seclare hor∣nesIer. 48. cast into the lake or pitt of fyer? now then shall Cryst nomore be persecuted in his members / wherfore he shall then be full glorifyed. And we shall haue oure bo∣dyes in ioye which once were partakers of oure persecucions / wherfore we shall then haue oure perfyt and full felicite / which yet in the mean tyme we haue one∣ly in oure sowlis. But what meaneth the aungell to saye: He shall sarle or destroye ye hyghe sayn∣tis? verely els but that with his false doctryne capciouse othes articles / & in∣terrogacions he shall fraudelently de∣ceyue and trappe the simple innocents and shed their blode tyrannously. Also he shall arrogantly take vpon him & thin∣ke to change the state of tymes and la∣wes. He weneth to change ye tyme which with swerde and fyer thinketh to shorten the lyfe of man and to preuent and disa∣point gods infallible eternall and immu∣table prouidēce wherby he hath prefiyed euery manis tyme & houre of deth which as noman can differre or prolong it / so cā∣ne noman shorten nor preuent it / except men will make God an ignorant persone and so consequently no god at all. He chā∣geth the tymes and lawes that any of the
sixe worke dayes commanded of god will make them vnholy and idle dayes when he lyste / or of their owne holy dayes abo∣lisshed / makeExo. 23. 20. &. 31. 34. &. 35. Leuit. 23 Deut. 5. worke dayes agen / & when they changed ye Saterday into Sondaye / of eting dayes fasting dayes / of mery and glad dayes to marye in / they can make so∣rowfull dayes forbiddinge maryages. They haue changed gods lawes and tur∣ned them into their owne tradiciōs to be kept aboue Gods preceptis. And as for their owne lawes they will change & bre∣ke them when they lyste. And this powr shal anticrist haue whether it be for long or shorte tyme. For so miche sowneth the Hebrew phrase / which is for a tyme / a lyt∣le whyle / & half a tyme / signifyinge that Anticryst shall make lawes to stande as long and as shorte tyme as he listeth and the tymes will he order / sett and change at his owne plesur. But is it not onely ye office of god to chang tymes and lawes? Here is therfore the prophecye fulfylled of him. Euen to exalt himselfe aboue all thing that god is called. This text. But the hyghe saynts he shall tangle trappe & destroye and arrogantly thinke to chan∣ge the tymes and lawes &c. is of diuerse lerned men diuersely translated. The vul∣gare text sayth: That he shall speke wor∣dis
ayenst the hyghe god. And destroy the sayntis of the mosthyghest & thinke that he maye change tymes and lawes & they shalbe taken into his hand for a tyme & half a tyme. Ioan Oecolampadius trans∣lateth it thus / He shall speke wordis on the syde of the most hyghest &c. and the Tygurine byble or zirk text hath. And he shall make wordis of diuine thinges. Derba enim faciet de rebus diuinis / that is / for he shall make wordis of diuyne things. The scole doctors of diuynite as Dnce and his faryne▪ what new strange sterting termes they haue inuēted to ex∣presse their dirty diuynite / the scole men know it / of the which their Missa trans∣substancion sacramēts and consecacion be some / ifye lyst to tast them / of ye which scoldinge scole mater thus termed / Paul gaue Timothe an ernest last warninge / adding aftir many graue monicions / Oh Timothe: kepe fast that ▪ is deposed in∣to thy custody / & beware and estiewe pro∣phane newe vanities of wordis and the∣se disputacions pro and contra / in their false science / falsely called diuynitie / which many doctours professing  / haue shamfully erred in the faith. In this vision / daniel seeth him to haue a mouth geuen him / spekinge great and
stowt thinges. To speke ayenst the hygh God / or to speke on his syde or on his be∣half for his worsship as though he were sent and commanded of God is when he speketh of himselfe starke lyes and blas∣phemies. Is it not ayenst god thus to spe∣ke and to make vs beleue that he speketh on the part of the most hyghest / when he speketh for the deuyll is parte and all on his syde? The serpent made Eue beleue that he spake on Gods syde / when he tol∣de hir that hir eyes shulde be opened and them to be as goddis / &c. The papists wold make vs beleue that in all their la∣wes, false worshipes / fulser inuocacions, decent seruice / laudable rytes and cere∣monies / in all their necessary enstrucciōs and vncrysten institucions / sermons / sa∣craments / blessingis / buzings halowin∣gis / ▪ sses and siche lyke / that they spe∣ke all for goddis worship and on his part / when all is playn ayenst god & his worde and for their owne fylthey lucre / honor / & synfull affectis. Thus make they wor∣dis or false mater of diuyne thingis / that is to saye / they mok with goddis holy wor∣de or thruste in their owne dreames for goddis worde into the greate hurte and slaying of his holy faithfull / & they think to change tymes and lawes: Which all
these thre thinges shall be putt into his powr (saith the aungell) for a tyme tymes and half a tyme / or as hath the Hebrew for a tyme long or short. How long ye chir∣che shall suffer vnder these hornes tyll cryst come to iugemēt, the daye and houre of their fall, and his cominge, God onely knoweth it. But the holy faythfull which haue bene these many yeres past / and yet be delyuered into their handis to suffer / (ah lasse) they thinke it to long that anti∣cryst shall thus raigne / and persecute the chirche vnto the last daye. But when the pestelent popes and the cruell Turke pro∣mise themselues the Monarchye of the hole worlde / then shall there be a soden fall of their wyked purpose / as it is ex∣powned before / for then shal that most de∣syred ioyfull daye of cryste beginne to shy∣ne ouer vs / in which daye yt chirche shall be saued and these thre beastis / the Pope with his clergye / the Turke and Mahu∣mete / with their. x. hornes persecutinge the gospell / shall be for euer dampned. Oh God immortall / howe greate vasta∣cions and destruccions in the chirche are there prophecied of Ezechiel to be madeGod & Magog of Gog and Magog? And here how cruell persecucions doth daniel prophecie to be done of the Turke and pope euen the two
handis and hornes of the deuyll? praye we therfore the mercyfull god / the father of oure sauior Iesu / as did king Ezechias that he wolde geue vs peace and his wor∣de in oure dayes / and wolde suffer shortly to come oure delyuerer Iesus / lest we be putt into the hande of this enimye / of all enimyes the most cruellest that now are / haue bene / and euer shalbe. So be it. For beter is it the last daye to come / then the Turke. Philip Melanchton both lernedly andPhilip. Melan. The do∣ctryne sharply noteth vpon this chapter. iii. thin∣ges to be cōtayned. A doctryne / a commi∣nacion / and a consolacion. The doctryne (he sayth) perteineth cheifly vnto this last age of the worlde. For men be merue∣lously moued at the slyber fortunes ther∣of / vnto both the parties. Some seing the great prosperouse successe fortunes and meruelous victories of the Turkis and other menis kingdoms / and cōtrary wy∣se the chirches of God to haue so harde fortunes / persecuted and destroyd in eue∣ry region / will rather folowe them that best prosper / and so fall from ye trewe chir∣che to the Turke or Pope yet raigning in seculare princes polycies / doctrynes and instituciōs / actis and articles / enbracing their false and vngodly religion. Yea they
miss ayed the Turke and Pope fightinge on their sydis to bringe them into an am∣plier and hygher empyre / to thentēt they might be ether partakers of their prospe∣rouse successe and lucre / or els to haue yt Turke their helpinge horne to suppresse the gospell / for vnto this ende shall the pope helpe the Turke / and the cardinals and bisshops helpe and perswade theire emperour and princes. Although themsel∣ues / as they wilnot receyue the Turkis wyked doctryne / so in their hertis will thei neuer be obediēt and subiect to their seculare lawfull headis and magistrats. But when they shall fynde an occasion / vtterly rebell and fight ayenst their hea∣dis. For this cause god warneth vs befo∣re / lest we taken with the admiracion of powr and good successe / or els broken wt trouble and persecucion fall from the go∣spell vnto these prosperosly puft vp prin∣ces and prelatis consentinge to their fal∣se doctryne and wyked enstruccions. The signes here described are the mani∣fest markis of an vngodly king and king∣dome.Tokēs of a wy∣ked king & kingdō One is to teache and suffer to be taught any doctryne contumelious iniu∣riose lasphemose ayenst god. Another is to kyll the faythfull good prechers & pro∣fessors of gods worde and to take awaye
the scriptures, the fode of their souls, from the simple poore thirstinge for the worde of their saluacion. Vnto these tokens god addeth this testimonye and threteninge. That he will dampne this beaste / be he Turke / emprour / prince or Pope / or allThe cō∣minaciō togyther and translate their wyked king∣doms into strange gouerners. Also here is to be noted a nother heuey thretening which precheth the calamitouse afflic∣cions of ye chirche. He sayth these hornes shall moue and make bataill against the godly and destroye many Crystians and their congregacions. Which is an heuey sermon and contrary to manis iugement thus reasoning. Wherfore shuld god ge∣ue so prosperous impery and victories to so open wyked men and to peple so contu∣meliose and cōtrary to cryste / openly blas∣pheming the scriptures and slayinge the trewe prechers? wherfore suffreth he vs callinge vpon him onely and oure onely mediator Cryste / holdinge his doctryne / thus cruelly to be cast awaye and oppres∣sed? Trewly daniel here speketh of a gre∣te greuouse calamite and long persecu∣cion. For in all Aphrica and in a greate parte of Asia / many yeres hath the name of cryst bene quenched. In Europa / albe∣it here and there in the Turkis empyre
there be left yet some crysten congrega∣cions / yet are they with so cruell heuey fierce bondag oppressed that no good stu∣dies of crysten letters maye there be ex∣cercysed / frely lerned and professed / the chirches beinge without trewe techers / & there many by lytle and lytle haue ca∣sten awaye ye name and religion of criste. As ye see this daye amonge vs many to fall bak to the Pope and to his popish do∣ctryne because ye seclare policye so strong∣ly and cruelly yet defendeth it. The turkThe cor∣rupcion of the youth. plucketh from the parents of cristians a certayn noumber of their chyldren to en∣struct them in bataill and to nosell them in his Mahumetis tradicions / rytes and religion / as do some Crysten emprours & princes pluke the yonge lerned from the vniuersites and scholes into their cour∣tes / which once poisoned with all courtly corrupcions / anon be they made bisshops cardinals / pastores and rychely benefi∣ced. Which miserable seruitute in courte is harder to a crysten curate then the bon∣dag in the ▪ fornace of Egypte. And yet are there many so madde that with greatsiewte & labors thrust themselues for luker and honour into this miserable derke Egypte. But what are the causes of these calamities aftir manis reason?
verely it is thought by manis iugement / The cor∣rupcion of ma∣nis iuge∣ment. the trwe chirche to be the synagoge of sa∣tan / & them to be heretiques which cleue to gods worde / or els why shuld god thus suffer them (thinke they) to be oppressed and brent if he loued them? And thus ma∣nis reson douteth whether they be rede∣med with Crystis blode which suffer pa∣cienly for his worde. But here must we beholde the face of the very chirche euen from ye beginningeThe for∣me & fa∣ce of the trw chir che. where oure first parēts sawe the testimo∣ny geuen oute of heuen in the sacrifice of Abel wherby they had hope the chirche to be continued and brought forth into Abels posterite. But lo / anon was Abel slayne of his owne brother / and wyked Cain a lone was left / whose vngodly po∣sterite bylt a cyte and playd the tyraunts whylis yet his first parents lyued and cō tempned of Cain their owne sone. Ayen / aftir Nohes flode (Babylon once buylt) the heithen (the doctryne of Nohe & Sem contempned) fyll from god. And but a ve∣ry lytle flok of godly men was there left / which sely flok wandred carefully hyther and thither poorely bysted / euen the fa∣mily of Abraham. And sone aftir / the sa∣mepsal. 104 sely sorte of Abrahams families poste∣rite were tossed into Egypt there oppres∣sed
with heuye seruitue in myer and ley groning vnder their intolerable burdēs / Exo. 1. which aftirwarde comen into Palestine there to dwell in the lande of Canaan / what slaughters suffred thei? How great mutacions and destrucciōs of their real∣me folowed them? what hard captiuities vexacions and affliccions endured and sustayned they? And how lytle a parte of the worlde was Israel and the Israeli∣tes? whylis yet in the mean casen / the gentilis which knewe not god obtayned the most hyghe empyres of the worlde. When we see therfore siche often poore troublos states and faces of the chirche / The fa∣ce of our present chirche. let vs aknowleg the wrath of god ayenst the worlde / & not fall from god / although in this last tyme we see the trew chirche greuousely shaken and afflicted / but let vs kepe fast in mynde this playn descrip∣cion and ferfull face of the chirche. That is by the meruclous counsell and will of god / the chirche to be layd vnder ye crosse. The causes wherof be shewed in the doc∣tryne of the prophets and apostles. One∣ly this thing let vs consyder concerning this fast olde age of the worlde. That the Prophets and Apostles prophecied / the world to be plaged / because that aftir the gospell be publesshed and preched in cer∣tain
regions / the tyrannous horned kin∣ges and papistis shuld wex wode and ta∣me their fierce furye vpon the sely weak members of cryste. And besidis this / for that euen of them / which shuld defende & nourish chirches / the pore congregaciōs shuld be persecuted seduced and polluted with images / false doctrin / cruell slaugh∣ter of saintis and with almaner prodigi∣ous lechery & lustis / we must knowe that of these seadis / stories do shewe ye Mahu meti poyson and the popish pestelente re∣ligion to haue had their beginings. When Arabia and Egipt and the Ro∣me chirche were  and torne into ma∣ny monstrose doctrines and sectis / then the confusion of sondry opinions and of supersticious semely ceremonies ād rites did moue light men to cleue to / and folo∣we their false doctrine cloked and colou∣red with hypocricye and apparent chosen holines. And therfore daniel lykeneth bo∣the Mahumete & the pope vnto that hor∣ne which hathe manis eyes / that is a fay∣er decent semely shewe of vtwarde deuo∣cion (as they sey) of laudable rites and gods holy seruice. Aftir this / as the tur∣kis powr encreased / so did the popis auc∣torite and false doctrine take place and sprede ouer all crystendom / so that as the
world was & is corrupt with their false re∣ligion / so is it / and shalbe greuously pla∣ged with the same two forked hornes for their idolatrye / for their worshiping of ded saintis / and for the prophaning and filthefying of the holy souper of the lorde and for their stinking wyue les chastite. But see nowe howe the tymes agree. It was decreed of the transubstancion (asWhefor Trāsub∣stācion & othomā began to gither. thei call it) in the yere of cryste 1215. No∣centius the thirde being pope. Which de∣cree hath confirmed the most horrible pro∣digiose idolatrye that euer was. And anō aftir in the yere 1250 begane Othomās kingdom to prospere. And so shortely af∣tir this idolatrie once cōfirmed / his king∣dom begane to aryse and encreased aboue all other regions and brought forth wea∣pens ayenst the west parte of the worlde to punisshe the filthei spottis of the romi∣she chirche. So that assone as this idola∣trie of the  begane to be confirmed of the pope / the turks powr did encrease to skourg it in cristendom / and shall yet more and more growe and preasse vpō vs tyl this idolatrie of the  be takē qui∣te awaye. This othoman being the great turke enlarged miche the turkis domini∣on / out of whose blode all the kinges of the turks sence vnto this day haue reig∣ned
and taken their originall / to whom god geueth strength and powr to punissh all cristendome for their idolatrye in the  / for their false inuocacion / and o∣ther abominacions whiche require a no∣ther Nebucadnezar / euen the turke to pu∣nisshe them. But yet is there added this consolaci∣on. Where Daniel signifieth that thereThe con solacion. shall neuer be the fyft monarchie. And therfore the turkis powr shall not be lyke the Romane empyre to destroy all Euro∣pe. For as ye see the popis kingdom to fal when he thought himself moste sewr and highest: euen so shall the turkes imperie faile and encline when he shall come to his highest thinking himself to conquire all and to raigne alone for euer / then shal his half tyme come vpon him with a sodē fall in the middes of his course. For then shall the moste glad day begine to shyne / in whiche the sone of god shall sterevp ye dead geuing to his chirche eternall lyfe and glorye / and casting all the vngodly into euerlasting torments. These same things be spoken of Gog and Magog inGog ma∣gog. Ezechiel and in apoca. 20. For Ezechiel faithe that Gog and Magog aftir theiEzechi. 3. 39. haue done their mischeif in destroing & slaynge / then shall their selues at laste
be desiroid in the mountains of Israel. Which albeit / it may be vnderstandē of the laste iugement / yet I think it to signi∣fie the batails which the godly haue and shall haue in this laste olde age with the popissh emprowrs kinges and turke, wcWhere ar ye mo∣untains of israel. all shalbe ouercomen in the hill is of Is∣rael / that is / in the places where the chir∣che of cryst dwellethe in which the gospel is preched and receyued▪ and the peple trwly in the faith of the sonne of god one onely mediatour call vpon their heuenly father. For the pope and turke shall not be ouercome but by the sone of god fight∣ing for his chirche as ye shall see it cler∣yer in daniel 12. chapt. saying. Michael (which is cryste) the great capitaine shal stond forth for the defence of the peples childrn. But bothe in daniel and in Eze∣chiel there be prophecied many great de∣struccions. Which with all our hertis we beseche god to mitigate  Hitherto Philip Mesancthon. This cap. is a prophecie of the monar∣chieThe. 8. Chapt. of the Perses to be translated to the grekis & Macedones / Dario their kinge slayn by Alexander / which dead / anon ye Monarchie of the grekis was diuided in to 4 cheif kingdoms that is into Mace∣done / Egipt / Asiam and Syram. And at

Al∣so it behoueth vs to be warned that we might know the causes of these plages and so to estiem them.

Then did the gote right valeant grete actes & was mightely & highly magnified / and when he was in his moste strength and powr / his great horne was broken / in wh∣se place there grewe forthe 4 hornes pro∣cedinge ayenst the fower partes of the

And then he stretched forthe himself ayenst the beutiful hoste & company of heuen / and of this celestiall company and also of the starris he threw downe some of them to the erthe and tro∣de them vnder his feet. yea and at laste / euen ayenst the self emperowr of the hoste with great arrogancye he lyfted vp him∣self with crakis and bostes so that therby the dayly perpetuall sacrifice was taken awaye / and the seat of the sanctuary of god was subuerted. And the heuēly hoste with their dayly perpetuall sacrifices we∣re geuen vp into his hand is for their syn∣ne / and he scourged down the trewth to the grounde and cōmitted this cruel mis∣cheif prosperously. When the Babylony▪ kingdome was now at an ende / and daniel had sen the Perses to haue the empyre / this vision was shewed him / to thentent he shuld te∣che his chirche how that both vnder the Medis and Perses the conquirers of Ba∣bylon / and also vnder Aleander the con∣quirer of the Persies / and at last vnder Antiochus that Anticryst and sourge of

This vision is a prophecie of the vprysinge and fall of the kingdōs of Cyrus / Alexander / & Antio∣chus the very pesielence of the Iewes.

He is called the two horned / because he ledforth the hostes of both the Medis and Persies. For his. ii. hornes signifye these two hostes. This Rammis greatest hyghe horne signifieth Cyrus ye king of Persie / the hayer at last of all Mede / yea and made the king of all the kingdome. This Ram to runne with his hornes ayenst the west / north & sowth signifieth him comen from the ast out of Persie to haue faughten ayenste all men / that is to weyt ayenste the Arabies and Egypcions which lye sowthe ayenst the

Euen so the kings Philip and Alexander ouerco∣ming all and nothing fearing / they were so ouercomen of wyne and lechery that the one was destroyed of voluptuosnes / and dronkenes kylled the tother.

Also let vs see the descripcion of theThe de∣scripciō of Grece lande / for that this Gote came from the west vpon the face of all the erth and at∣teyned or lyted not vpon the erth. Which signifieth Ale vander coming forth from Grece to inuade estewarde & then sowth∣warde & at ast northwarde in short space subdewed all the world vnto him. To not towche nor lyte vpon the earth it is sayd / because he beginning in his .xx. yere / did in a maner flye ouer all the worlde & was made the emperour of all the worlde in the xxxii. yeare of his age / wherin he dyed not for age nor in victorye but with volu∣ptuosnes and wyne was he oppressed. Wherfore that prominent great horne of the Gote in his most srength broken of / signifyeth the mighty power of great A∣lexander
smyten downe in his cheif flo∣wers. Whether ther be yet any siche Go∣tis / let their fortune declare them / & the clere eyed obserue it. But whom did he so smyte with his horne verely euen ye ram before the floude. For as in floudis one sourge soupeth vp & deuoureth a nother / An apte simili∣tude. euen so one of these kingdoms deoured vp another / the later swellowd vp ye for∣mer. And how the Persik kingdome was translated to the Grekis / and the Greke empyre of Alexander diuided into ye Ma∣cedonyk / Syriac / Asiatik & Egypt king∣doms (which all / Daniel by all his wor∣des of the Ram and Gote will teche) it is plentuos lyer described of Diodoro / Cur∣tio / Iustino. &c. Now to the lytle horne sprongen vp out of these .iiii. hornes / that is to saye / of Antiocho Epiphane.Of ye lyt le horne Antio∣chus E∣pipha∣nes. The lytle horne signifieth Antiochum Epiphanem descendinge out of the stock of Seleucus holdinge Syriam aftir the death of Alexander / whiche aftir this ways came to the kingdome. Out of Se∣leuco was borne Antiochus the greate / which had these .iii. sones / Seleucū / An∣tiochum Epiphanem / and Demetrium. And when Antiochus the greate warred with the Romans and had left in hostage or pledge Antiochum Epiphanem & De∣metrium /
he dyed in Syria /  left his so∣ne Seleucum aftir him / no king but a foo∣le / wherfore Epiphanes knowinge of his fathers death / gote himself preuily from Rome and came into his fathers kingdo∣me / & his vnapt brother deud / he enioied the kingdom in the .137. yere aftir Alexan∣ders death / witnesse the .1. chapter. of the first of the Maccabeis. This Antiochus was of Catalinaris crafty witte. Wher∣fore daniel here prophecieth that by An∣tiochum Epiphanem the sowtheste (euen the most pleasaunt lande of the Iewes / shuld be skourged and plaged / which is called zby in Hebrewe for hir fertilite / that is the beutye and flowr of all landis euen as the Iewes / for the trwe worship of god delyuered them by Moses and the prophetis / are called the beutyfull orna∣ments hooses or companies of heuen / as be the sonne mone and starres. He skour∣ged the sowth / when he inuaded Egypt makinge bataill against Ptolome the el∣der / his sisters sone being king / and com∣pelled Alexandriā to flye for socoure to Ptolome hir yonger brother. But how ye senators of Rome desyered of his brether∣ne expelled false Antiochū out of Egypt by their ambassiadour Popilium / ye shall se it in .34. boke of Iustini / & partely here aftir
How Antiochus skourged and plaged that pleasant desyred lande / throw down the starres into the erth and destroyd the1. mach. 1 & .2. holy habitacle / in the first and .ii. of Mac cabeis / it is so clerrely and cruelly ex∣pressedMacc. 5. / that I abhorre and tremble not onely to speke / but also to wryte any more of this blodye beast. But right heuey de∣stines abyde them that euyll deserue / which thing I maye confirme by the ex∣ample of Antiochus the very image of An∣ticryst. For when he inuaded & destroyde in the east parties (as daniel here pro∣phecieth) and not onely from the besege of Elymaid of Persie / he was with the great heuines of his mynde repelled and put bak / but also when it was tolde him his capitayn Lysiane with his host to ha∣ue  fledde / he fyll into so greate a sy∣kenes and thought / that before his death1 mach. 6 he confessed himself therfore so greuous∣ly to be plaged and so compelled to dye / because he had so spoyled and destroyd y4 temple of Ierusalem and so cruelly skour∣ged the Iewes. For it was not enoughe for him thus to persecute the Iewes and subuerte all their lawes / holy rytes and godly ceremonies and sacrifices institu∣ted of God / but he wold arrogantly blas∣pheme god himself / suppresse his trewth
with all his diuyne sacred ordinances. yea and he prospered in his mischeif. This miche be sayd for the preface of the prophecye. Now heare the interpreter. ☞ And I hearde an holy one speakeText. saying vnto a certayn meruelouse excel∣lent one. How longe shall this vision of the dayly perpetuall sacrifice and of the blasphemose synne which is the cause of this deuasacion and destruccion endure / that both the holy sacred temple with all hir sacrifices and the Iewes shalbe thus troden downe? And he answered me. Af∣tir two thousand and. 300. dayes whichWhich is 6. ye∣res▪ 3. mo∣neth & 20 dayes containe the daye and night / shall the ho∣ly temple be restored to the iust and law∣full vse. And whylis I daniel beheld the vision desyerouse to knowe it / lo there sro∣de before me one lyke a man. And I hear∣de with in the floude eule the voyce of a man crying out sayinge: Gabriel / teache this man this vision. Then he came nye the place where I stode / whose coming so nyghe me / made me so afrayd / that I fyl∣downe flat one my face. And he sayd vn∣to me: Attende and perceiue thou sone of man. For this visiō shalbe fulfilled in the last tyme (or in the ende of the captiuite.) And whylis Gabriel thus spake with me I fylldowne grouelinge as one had bene

And then he sayd: Beholde / I shall teache the what thinge shall come whenwrath is ye captiui∣te of Ba∣bylō & of antioch{us} this wrath is finisshed / for it shall haue an ende at the tyme prefixed. Daniel calleth the interpretor of the vision / a meruelouse excellent one. As I say calleth cryst a meruelous one / a coun∣seller / &c.I say. 9. Gabriel yt strēgth of god. Here therfore he asketh this meruelouse one whiche was cryst appe∣ringe lyke the aungell Gabriel (so called for his meruelouse excellent strengthe) how long ye peple of god shuld be so skour∣ged and persecuted of Antiochus / which was the figure of oure Anticrysten Antio∣ches and lytle horne crept vp in the Ro∣mane imperye / and so consequently what afflicciōs hang ouer the chirches of cryst to the worlds ende / for it is manifest that whatsoeuer the aungel tolde before of the heuey affliccions of the Iewes / the same be now verified and done vpon the chir∣che of the gentyles / which thinges sith they be past / it is no dowt / but the rest of the vision is in fulfillinge now / and shal∣beCryst is ye merue∣louse one. euery daye fulfyssed vpon vs tyll cryst become to iugement.

Daniel gods painter wolde by the de∣scripcionAnti∣shame∣les face. of Antioche / prefigure vnto vs the maners of Anticryste. First of his vn∣shamefaced face for that he was & is the moste impudent despyser of god and the fiercest bolde beast to persecute and to be contrarye to his worde as be the two son∣nes of antioche this daye / the turke & the Rome bishop wt his hornes / ye most shame∣les pestelent persecutors and condemp∣ners of the gospel of god / for arrogantly dare thei do what thei liste contrarye to gods wil. Of his fraude is he described. for as that subtyll fraudelent foxe Antio∣chushis frau∣des. craftely circumuented egipte & Iu∣deam / euen so be the false turke and his subtyle serpent the pope the two crafty marchants with their false fayned wor∣dis & deuillish doctryne to peruerte al mē not of their owne powr / but of other me∣nis. For Antiochus was so mighty ouerof other menis powr. Iudam / by the falshed and vnfaithful∣nes of the bisshops of the iewes and by ye vain leuite of the peple as it is redde in the Maccabeis. And euen so these two bretherne (albeit vnlyke inprofession) the
turke and the pope / gote and constituted their kingdoms by other men is powr and might. The turke at first by the mighty fraudes of mahumete, and the pope by the powr of emperowrs bisshops cardinals kin∣ges and his owne subtyle supersticiouse hypocrysye and chosen holines. And now therfore shall ye note that by the counsell & mischeif of the bishops Anticristis seat shalbe translated and tos∣sed from the ecclesiasti cheier of Rome vnto the secular emperowrs and king is trones as the storye fygured in that secu∣lar and anticriste Antiochus / which was out of the stoke of the emperowr of the gre∣kis called Seleucus and helde the king∣dom of Syre And begune to raigne in the 137. yere aftir the dethe of Alexander / as witnesseth the first boke of the Maccabe. This hathe euer ben sene in all stories. That the emperowrs and kinges will at∣temper bende and bowe all religions and beleifes vnto their owne profit and plea∣sures. As when Antiochus knewe the ie∣wes for their religion and faith not glad∣ly to suffere any heithen king to be their gouerner / he first studied howe he might destroie their faith and subuerte their re∣ligion and so to become their kinge. For he iuged all religions besydes his own to
be van and false / whiche beinge in this prowd temerariouse iugement cōceiuing of himself to haue auctorite to chang me∣nis faith and gods religion / fyll into ma∣ny carnall lustis, filthines, ambicion, and into allkynd of greuose crimes casten vp of god to fight boldely ayenst god himself euen to bring Iudeam into bondage and to abolisshe all the old doctrine of the pro∣phets vnto the whiche his prowd purpo∣se, the vngodly wikednes of the bisshops ministred diligently this occasion. For when the godly man Onias was bishop of the iewes / his brother Iason went toOnias. Iason. Antiochus in the beginning of his raig∣ne and gaue him money to destroie his brother Onias and to geue him the bys∣shoprik. And by a lyke fraude there came the third man Menelaus and he pluk the bisshoprik from Iason / which bishops brought in the greke prophane filthei opē playes into the cite of Ierusalem to do an∣tioche pleasure / thei trode vnder foe & contempned gods lawe and conformed themselues vnto the most filthye court∣ly prophane facions of Antiochus drow∣ned in all excesse, pryde, dilicate and soft syuing and in all the haithen maners. Af∣tir this / was menelaus slayn / whom the bisshop Alcimus succeded which was al∣so
a pestelent ennimie to the Maccabeis. These obominable crimes of the bishops were the seadis of all the miseries & cala∣lamitis of that tyme / as thei be nowe. Nowe returne we to the comparison of an∣tiochusanticrist descri∣bed of his va∣acion. with Anticrist describing him of his incredible destruccion. Which howe he destroid the peple of god / as we cānot reade it without grete dolour writē in the Maccabeis / euen so not without weping teares do all crystē men nowe fele it how the cursed turke abolissheth the diuyne scriptures / and the Romishe bisshop (the lorde god renyed which hath bought vs) bringeth in his dampnable fectis as pe∣terantioch{us} was for∣tunate. 2 Macca be. 5. witnesseth. Nowe see what good suc∣cesse and fortune he had in his mischeif: which prosperite therin god gaue him to skore the peple for their sinnes. And out of the same spring and well it is clea∣re that the prosperouse successe of the tur∣ke and of the pope floweth / as Paul wit∣nesseth / affirming god to geue them effe∣ctuouse errours & stronge illusions to be∣leue lyes. He is also described of his op∣pressionantioch{us} ye oppres∣sor of gre∣te & good men. of great men and of the holymē. But wherfore permitteth god him so to do verely because he hateth sinne whose grauite we see not / & will mortifye vs  the crosse: nether was the worlde at any
tyme worthei to haue any holy man long to dwell in it. Wherfor this serpētin sea Antiochus must nedis / to his paine / fele ye mighty faithful of the chirche / by their faith and prayers to be stronger then all the emperowrs popes kings deuils & dea∣thes. An example haue ye of those 7 bre∣therne with their mother.

Because Antiochus Mahu∣mete & the popese so good successe of their false lerning and fraudis wherwith thei and their bisshops doctours and false a∣postles bewitche & inflame the emperowrs kinges and their mighty magistrats of the worlde to persecute the congregaciōs of god / thei be extolled in themselues & ar become so grete contempners of god & his worde as the 10 and 73 psalmes de∣scribe them.

At laste Daniel describeth him of his departing. For the workeman is worthei his rewar∣de. As before cryst is first coming / Antio∣chus not touched with manis hand but with the hand of god / therfore dyed with alto late repentance because he so cruelly
destroid the peple of god and their tēple / 1 mach. 6 euen so before cristis second coming / this wiked forlorn childe shalbe reueled and with the breath of the lordes mouthe de∣stroid: that is / the errours of anticrist the2. thes. 2. pope and his kinges and emperowrs shal∣be disclosed and reprehended by the doc∣trine of the lawe and gospell / so that all the holy faithfull shall abhorre them and fall from them, non to cleaue to them but the dampned wretches. Paul confirming the same / saing. Thei shalbe all condemp∣ned whiche beleue not the trewth but de∣light in vnright wysnes. Hitherto haue we compared Antiochum with anticryst. And nowe albeit the lorde in this owr ty∣me skourgeth vehemently the kingdoms of anticryst with the gospell / yet shall not his kingdoms altogither fall before his luste iugement / as Paul affirmeth saing. He shall destroy him with his cleare and bryght cominge. And in the Apocal. The false prophete shalbe caste into the douou∣ring botomles pitte. Whoso therfore is wyse let him auoyd out of babylon / that is let him fal from anticryste. Netherfore feare let vs not forsake the profession of the gospell / for the persecuciō of the anti∣crists. For beter is it for crists sake to dye then with anticrist to lya vnto the ende.
Nowe returne to the descripciō of owr anticristen Antioches in the text where be many particles hauing very heuye & terrible significacions or tokens to come ouer them / whiche euery diligent reader by himself may consider if he beholde our present dayes. The trewth (saith Daniel) shalbethe text & 12 ver∣se. troden vnder fote vpon the erthe. For now we see the bisshops and their sworne secular sort to defende ayēst their owne consciences the most manifest cri∣mes impieties and all abominacion / as be their vngodly abuses of sses / playn idolatry / worshiping of dead seiants / stoc∣kes & stones / wyuelesse vnchaste chastite whoreom and all maner prodigiouse le∣cheries. Wherfore it is plaine that thei mok and blaspheme the verite / euen cryst and his rightwismaking and trede down the trewthe vnder their sinfull fete. Of these bothe secular & spirituall anticrists thus saith the text. There shall stondvp a bolde vn∣shamefaced kinge euen the very blasphe∣mose arrogant cotempner of god / he shal be subtyle fraudelent vnderstāding how to satiffye his couetuse and libidinose luses. This kinge shall growvp and obtaine
his wiked plesures / non sui viribus / not by his own powr & strengthe or lerning / but (as did Antiochus rob the temple) by the fraudis of the bisshops / and by the in∣constant leuite of the peple. And aboue al mens estemacion he shall waast and con∣sume infinite ryches of his owne & other menis. He shal abolish the trwe worship of god and bring in idolatry causing it to be spred ouer all: he shall nosel his peple with haithen rytis and ceremonies. And he shall haue great successe & for∣tune. He shal slaye many godly men / and wyn many men with great giftis / ryche byshopriks and benefices and fayer pro∣myses / whom when he hathe taken with his beastly bely beightis / he shall reteine them in seruice to augment his profits & to satisfye his lustes and plesures in en∣creasing his riches dignities titles and his owne carnall affectis. But atlast without handis shal beText. be destroid. Antiochus was not slan of the iews / The en∣de of An tiochus. but s he prepared himself vnto a newe betail / being at home fyll down out of an high place and hurt himself vnto dethe as write some writers. And this heuye∣chaunce was because he sawe his owne peple and all other nacions fall from him
which hated him for his cruelty and des∣pised him for his beasily lyuinge. For he which shulde haue bene graue sober and sadde wolde daunce and dalye amonge mommers and maskers in open taurns & stewes. He wold drinke dronken among whores in euery comon howse and skater money in the srcates / so that of many men / he was nomore called Epiphanes noble and clere but epimanis that is to saye / mad or out of his mynde. Now conferre me the image of Antio∣chus vnto oure seclare emperours / kinges popes and bishops / which studeing to rai gne aboue all in all welthy pleasures / cō∣tend to destroie those princes which wold receyue the gospell: and they singe all powrs both rulers and peple cheily to be holden with supersticion / luere and pro∣fits / craftely therfore they deuyse and in∣uent worshippinges and seruices which they know men will wonder at / and sone delight therin / and menis myndis miche to be moued at these their prodigiose prai∣ses and apparent deuocions with admi∣racions in their ▪sses therby to meryt almaner goodnes as victories aduanta∣ges and prosperose successe / luere & good fortune in all their affaires. And because ye wyked soule cannot wayt for helpe from
God only / therfore it seketh many Gods and siche as thei thinke wilbe sone plea∣sed. And for this cause is the worship and inuocacion of dead saintis very desyero∣se and accepted / sone perswaded vnto ig∣norant men. Aftir this begune the chir∣ches to be thrustfull of saints images wherof there folowed ye most fierce mad∣nes in gadding and running to committe idolatry. By this wylde wodenes was ye doctryne of ye rightwysemaking by faith and the trewe religion vtterly extincted and the supersticiouse tradicions of men receyued / with fylthey vowes and syn∣full sole lyuinge / difference of meatis of habits and siche lyke monstrose monkery brought into ye chirche. And in these mad∣nesses to be inuēted they vsed serpentyne subtyltye and bolde arrogant audacite. For it is a very arrogāt act (the worde of god despysed) to institute newe worship∣pings or newe doctrynes ayenst gods cō∣mandemēt or without his expresse word. And a subtyle deceyte is it to studye by what engins menis myndis mighte be trapped & snarled / & what nettis might be bent and layed to augement their An∣ticrysten powr lucre and lustis. Wherfo∣re by lytle and lytle as the ryches of the popis kingdome encreaced euen so shall
the ryches / dominion and synfull pleasu∣res grow vp and encreace in certain secu∣lare kingdoms and in the Turkes to / suc∣cedinge ye romish beast in lyke or in cruel∣ler impietie & persecucion / wherfore they that be yet sworne to the Romesh whore / or to any secular sone of perdicion / they be reteined partely by supersticion & par∣tely with the greate benefites and profi∣tes they possesse or be in hope to receyue of these two ryche beastis. For hytherto pertayne the wordis of Daniel saing. His innumerable ryches with hisText. apparēt prosperite shall deceiue and sley many. That is to say. Both these Anticrysten estates shall prouok many to siewe to thē for promociō and dignities which being once reteined / and they once masshed / & morteused in their courtesy palaces / fete∣red with ryches / lymed with glorye and dignites / glytering in their owne concey∣ted reuerence and honor / then be they ca∣ptiued of Anticryst sworne to his misera∣ble & dampnable seruice as ye see it this days. And as the spirituall Anticrystis kingdome is not goten nor defended by their owne strengthe / but partely by the supersticion of emperours and kings / euen so be the seculare Anticrystis hopen by
the spirituall councels and conuocaciōs of their bisshops vnto their Anticrysten exaltacion & autorite aboue god. And all because vngodly men gladly desyer & de∣fende these their owne so greate profitis. As ye se now how fiercely ye nobilite figh∣teth to reteyne in their handis / collegis abbeis chauntres / bisshoprykes benefi∣ces / &c. for their owne profite. And ayen / the kinges defende the pompe and pryde of their bisshops that they might the glo∣riouslier serue them in their courtes and legacies / and might haue their hawles the gorgiouslier haunted and furnesshed with siche monstrose myters and croked crosses.

As did yt bishop Menelaius bringin and prouoked Antiochus so to rob the temple settinge before him so many ryche proyes and ie∣wels and also the kingdom of the.

For albeit many princes approue not their idols and tyranny of the clergy / yet for their sakis they execute horrible cru∣eltie. And in the mean tyme they reioyse & smye on themselues with smothe coun∣tenances / fayning this dampnable excu∣se. That they must defende the auctorite of the chirche. Also where daniel sayth. That deceite and fraude shall pro∣sper in their handis.Text. It hath a large sence. First it signi∣fieth their falsely inuented doctrynes wt gliteringe hypocrisye commended of the worlde / besydis this / it signifieth ye other
crafty deceitfull bondis wherby the spi∣ritualty hath bwnd the kinges and em∣prours to them / or haue minisshed their powrs plucking to themselues the seclare possessions and their auctorite. And ayen it signifieth the fraude of the secular prin∣ces in pluckinge the ryches & possessions of the spiritualty into their owne handis vnder some honest colour of reformacion of the chirche / abolishment of abuses he∣resies and schismes / or by promisinge to defende their false faith & false religion. And now they bothe with a woundrefull craft and wylie driftis / fayn a freshe and paintforth (I cannot tell what) certayn greate abuses and heresies / with perels to after the olde vsages / to make any in∣nouacions / or to abolisshe the aunciet de∣cent rytes and laudable ceremonies or co∣mely customs in the chirche / or sodenly to set of the wont and olde receyued holy holy diuyne seruices. And by these crafty perswasions they incense emperours & kin∣ges craftely / to persecute and sley cruelly the professors and prechers of gods wor∣de / as haue the pope and his clergy labo∣red these. 9. yeres to bringe the emprour vpon the Germās for receiuing the gos∣pell / but ye Turkes soden incursions euer at those tymes letted him and them both.
All these thinges daniel vnderstandethDlus. by this worde Dolus / which is crafty de∣ceite or subtyle gyle and fraude. At last he sayth: That both these anticrystes thus tossinge the ball betwixt them / one kla∣wing the tothers bak. They shall be destroyd withouteText. handis. Wherby he signifieth that before cry∣stis last cominge / the gospell shalbe pre∣ched & setforth openly / which shall with∣oute weapens and humane powr / smyte∣downe both these anticrystes false aucto∣rites and strength of both these estatis. As in the chapter folowinge he sayth: That the wyse and lerned emong the pe∣ple shall teache many men to beware and auoyd Anticryst / but these shalbe smyten downe with swerde for their good doctry∣ne. And then / sayth Paul / shall that wy∣ked2. thes. 2. vngodly chylde be reueled / whom ye lorde shall destroye and slaye with the breath of his mouth / signifying to come / that Anticrystis errours and false doctry∣ne shalbe reprehended / and confuted be∣fore the generall iugement / euen as the grey morning gothe before the sone vpry∣singe. Here is it clere that this prophecie is now verefied and perteyneth to this oure tyme / wherein the gospell is now so
purely and so vniuersally by gods infalli∣ble prouidence publisshed bothe by bokis and prechers ouer all the worlde / as Da∣niel and Paul declared it. That in these last dayes shal be great bataill and stryfe / and miche contencion ayenste these anti∣cristis doctrine / themselues so cruelly de∣fending it fyghtinge ayenst god & his holy worde. Wherfore here now let bothe the parties look well vpon themselues / that is bothe spirituall and seculare / and con∣tempne not the monicion of the holy gost. The name of the chirche holdeth backThe na∣me of the chirche. many men / that they be not against these bisshops and their seculare impes. But ye holy gost in daniel and Paul / clrely wit∣nesseth / that kingdom (whether it be spi∣rituall or seculare / Turke or Mahumet) which defendeth idolatry and sleyeth ye godly / not to be the chirche / but a faccion & a synfull secte reiected of god. And ther∣fore Daniel exhorteth almen to forsake this Anticrysten chirche / as cryethe the aungell in the Apocalypse sayinge. Get ye forth auoyd and flye oute of Babylon. Agene / he conforteth the godly which re∣bke and refute their errours certifyed themselues to haue the commandement of God for them / and in so ebukinge the vngodly / they e sewer to please god / all god

Nethelesse he promiseth the very trwe chirche to continew and abyde ferme and faste albeit many of them be slayn for the trwthe / for thus he saith. The peple which know their god shall haue the victory &c.Text.

For all this long whyle ceassed the building of the cy∣te and temple and miche peple of the Ie∣wes remayned styll at Babylon and in Persie with Daniel / Esdra and Neemia the cause why the moste parte taryed yet styll dispersed amonge the gentils was / for some had their substance among them some sawe that the worke at home was so forboden of Cambyses / that it went not forthward and despeyered of the reedifi∣cacion therof / and some did set naught by
that goodly lande of Iuda / but had ra∣ther pleasure in the idols of the gentyles then in the trewe religion of God / many moo causes there were of their so long ta∣ryinge. For it was as harde a returne from Babylon to Iudea as was from out of Egypte into the same lande / & lenge∣re were they in returninge now / ere they were all brought from Babylon. For they returned / here now some / and then some / as Cyrus permitted them / the buyldinge beinge forboden / and letted all these. 44. yeres / vnto ye second yere of thissame Da∣rius Longimane: so horribly hatethe god synne. Wherfore daniel now seinge the lxx. yeres of Ieremye past / and also mo∣re then. xl. yeres to / and yet the most part of the peple there taryinge styll and ne∣ther temple nor cyte of Ierusalem buyl∣ded / he consydering the synnes of the pe∣ple to be the cause of this breache and de∣laye / fyll to prayer as ye see him inflam∣med there vnto / at the reading of Iee∣mye calling now vpon god almighty and the most mercyfull father of Iesu Cryste oure delyuerer / to be made certeiner / not onely of the tyme of Ierusalem to be re∣difyed and yen to be at laste vtterly de∣stroyd / but also of the tyme of the coming of cryst into flesshe / which tyme to knowe
so insily was geuen to no prophete so long before / but onely to Daniel / of the which example of Daniel to be folowed of all ministers of ye worde / we maye lerne not onely by the readinge of the prophetis to aske consolacion / but also by the exam∣ple of the prophetis to aske to be delyue∣red from the curse of the lawe and to ob∣teyne of god the promises in cryst. What thinke ye daniel thus tourned to god and seking the lorde prayed to obteyne and to be putt from him? Verely euen this that ye see folowinge in his prayer / wherin ye maye see howe he vsed the difference of the lawe and gospell. But let vs heare Daniel prayinge. ☞ In making my prayer vnto the lor∣deText. my God / I confessed my self sayinge:Daniels prayer. I beseche the oh lorde god / greate and to be feared / kepinge couenant and mercye with them that loue the and obserue thy preceptis heare me. We be synners and haue offended / we haue done vngodly / and are fallen from thy commandement and gone bake from thy lawes. We haue not heard thy seruāts the prophets which in thy name taught and spake to oure kin∣ges to oure rulers / to oure fathers and to all the peple of the lande. With the (oh lorde) is rightwysnes / but shame is now
vnto vs / as thou seist it / euen to vs the Iewes cytisens of Ierusalem / & Israe∣lits nyghe and farre of dispersed and sca∣tered of the into all the nacions for these synnes which we haue committed ayenst the. Oh god / ours is the shame / euen the shame of oure owne kinges of oure rulers and of oure fathers because both we and they haue synned ayenst the. But it is thy propertie / oh lorde / bothe to haue mercye and to forgeue vs / for we haue forsaken the / we haue not obeyed the voyce of oure lorde god to lyue aftir his lawe setforth before vs by his seruants the prophetes. For all Israel hath transgressed thy la∣we / yea and hath fallen bak from the / the haue not obeyed thy voyce. Because we haue thus synned / lo the curse and othe wryten in the lawe of Moses thy seruāt / are powred forth vpon vs. He hath payd vs in dede wt his worde which he spake ayenst vs and oure iuges / which shulde haue tolde vs the lawe so that they haue brought vs into so great calamite / that vnder the hole heuen is there not so dealt with any nacion as it is now happened to Ierusalem. For as it is wryten in the lawe of Moses / euen so are all the plagesDeu. 27. and curses casten vpon vs. Nether called we vpon oure lorde God for grace to go
fro and forsake our wykednes and to kno∣we thy trewthe. Wherfore god hath not slept to caste these miserable plages vpō vs / for isre is the lorde our god in all his works he doth. Ah / we haue not obeid his voice. Nowe therfore Oh lorde our God whiche haste ledforth thy peple out of the londe of Egypt by thy powr so mighty / & therby didist get thyself so great a name which yet vnto this daye thou eioyeste. But e ar the sinners and haue lyued so vngodly and wykedly. Oh sorde / for thy moste excellent rightwysemakinge sake let thy wrathe go from vs / and thy anger from thy cyte Ierusalem that same thy ho∣ly hill and be blown ouer it. Fore owr sin∣nes and for ye wykednesses of our fathers Ierusalem and thy peple are made an ig∣nominiouse lawghig stok vnto owr dwel∣lersExo. 15. rownde aboute vs. Now therfor (ourBaruh. 2 god) heare the supplicacion of thy seruant hear his prayers beseching the to shewe a merciable countenaunce vpon thy holy temple thus desolated and destroid / Oh forde god shewe it / for the lordis sake in∣cline thyne eare (my god) and heare / open thyne eyes and behold how desolated we be / and howe forsaken is thy cyte whiche bereth thy name. For not in our own pray∣ers powered forth befor the▪ do we allege
oure owne rightwysenes / but thy most ry∣che infinite mercye bring we forth for vs. Ah lorde / heare / lorde be mercyfull and spare vs / lorde attende / helpe / and ceas∣se not / my God / euen for thy nowne sake do it / for thy cyte and thy peple are called aftir thy name. Oh / how full of humble and feruent affectis is this prayer. Daniel himselfe was in hyghe fauor with the kinge and in no bondage nor affliccion / but the sorow that he oke was for the calamitie of the peple / desolacion of the temple / and neg∣lect of Gods worship. And are there not now as greate occasions geuen vs to we∣pe and to praye thissame prayer? verely yf we beholde these troublos laste blody dayes and the cruell persecucion of the crystianes in euery lande / the famyne / ye murthers / the dearthe / and the trwe wor∣ship of God extincted with idolatrye / in how dampnable a state all the worlde is / how rype and ranke is all synne and ini∣quite / what vanites lyes falsehed errors deceite enuy rankor theft whordō pryde hypocrise raigne / and all trewth rightwy∣senes with fayth and loue to be exyled / we wold verely confesse with Daniel all these plages and punsshemēts to come ouer vs worthely for oe owne greuouse
and manifold sinnes. But what do owr wea bisshops and prelats which shuld in this  playe daniels parte withe prayers? Thei persecute & sowe forthe al ye seads of al these calamities & mischeif. Ah lorde that this owr age is thus desti∣tute of Daniel. Sende vs oh lorde some daniels for cristis sake. But to the payer. This place standeth of prayer and re∣pentance flowing forthe out of the know∣lege of the lawe and gospell. For as doth all the scripture / so doth this prayer brea∣the forth here & there ye law and gospell.Repētan ce. Wherfore because repentance or contrici∣on the mother of prayer bringe forth theconfessi∣on. confession of sinnes and this confession prayth to auoid the punisshements / andFaith. prayer. the paines of syne to be put away / for that she considereth the comminacions of the lawe / and prayth for remission according to ye promises of the gospel / let vs note wc parte of the prayer expresseth the lawe & which the gospel. Daniel begineth of the confession or prayse of the rihtwysenes of god gouerning the world with his threa∣tenings and promises. For where he cal∣leth god great and terrible he signifieth god by the execucion of his threatenings to shew himself greater & ferefuller then all his enimies euen the brekers of his
10. wordis. But where he saith / god to ke∣pe couenant with them that loue him / he shewth God by the fulfilling of his pro∣mises to geue a thousande folde more be∣nefits and goodnes to the godly thē thei be able to aske or deserue. Daniel remembring the prophecye of Ieremie was moued th{us} to pray / teching vs / in trouble to fetche consolaciō at the promises of god by reading ye scriptures / here be we taught that albeit god had pro∣mised to bringe them home ayē / yet wold he vs instantly to praye and to aske the sa∣meGod wold vs to aske both bo∣dely and gostly be∣nefits. benefit of himself to thentēt that our faith shuld be exercised by prayers & in∣uocacion / as saith cryste / aske and ye shal receyue your peticions. Also call vpon me in the tyme of your tribulacion & I shall delyuer you. He willeth also by this mea∣nis our repentance to encreace / as saith zacharie. Be ye turned to me and I shall turne me to you. And in that he praith for the restoring of the congregacion / he ge∣ueth vs example vnfainedlye with hert to lament the persecuciō and calamities of cristis chirche and to pray god to encre∣ace gouern and preserue it. It displeaseth god greuouslye when men sitting in ease and securite be not moued with pitie at yeAmos.  calamities troubles and persecucions of
the pore chirche of god as Amos complai∣neth / saig w be to the weal ryche / wc be not moued with heuin ad pietie to see Ioseph whiche is ye peple of god brokē slayn and persecuted. Daniel therfore cō∣sideringe this thing with pitie / begineth his prayer wt so greuouse an heuye sorow∣full sighe and complaynt of their sinnes reciting their great payns and afflicci∣ons. Which praier we ought dayly now to praye togither in the chirches. Here is setforth the doctrine of repentance. For daniel aknowlegeth the sinnes of the pe∣ple attributina to god the praise of right∣wysmakinge and that he had iustely pu∣nisshed them. Then he prayth for the re∣mission of their sinnes and to be reducte into their londe. It is therfore the begin∣ing of repentance or contricion to aknoleThe be∣gining of repentā∣ce. ge the wrath of god ayenst our sinnes / to feare him / and to lamēt that we haue of∣fended our so graciouse god / to geue him laude and prayse for that he hath by iuste punisshment calde vs bake to obaye him / paciently suffering his hande. This con∣fession daniel reciteh saing: with the (oh lorde) is there rightwysnes / but with vs is ther open confusion and shame to our faces. This is the very voice of trwe con∣tricion31. and 1 as hath the psal. I said I shal cō
fesse my sinnes to the lorde and he forga∣ue me my iniquities Ayene. Ayenst ye saith Dauid  I tels but a sinner & euil in thy sight haue I done / that thou shuldst be fownde trw in thy promises and ouer come whē thou art iuged: that is to saye / The ve se of the psal. ex∣powned. I knowlege myself to be not els but a sin ner and giltie in thy sight / vt iustificeris that is. In thus confessing myself I prei∣se and declare thy iust punisshment & also thy victory whyles peruerse ypocrites iu∣ge the (oh lorde) to be to roughe and rigou∣rose ayenst this owrsinfull nature accu∣sing and condēpning thy iuste iugemēts for that thei cannot submitt themselues worthy to suffer thy hande, aknowleging themselues worthely punisshed. And he∣re is the grinning anger & preuey poison in menis hertis ere thei can confesse god iustly to plage them fortheir sinnes / and so confesse their sinnes to him and hum∣bly aske forgeuenes / as ye may see in the 3. verse of the. 32. Psal. dauid saing why∣lesPsal. 32. I now helde my tongue and woldnot confesse my secrete sinnes / there tormen∣ted me greuouse vexacion euen in my bo∣nes with continuall out roring. For daye and night thy hand ley so heuey vpon me pressing me down that my moistnes was turned into the somer drynes. And ther∣fore
Paul oft inculketh these two wordis. God to be declared iuste and also iustify∣ing / thatRom. 3. we might prayse him whylis he iustely punissheth vs and then not ascri∣bing to ourselues any parte of our right∣wyse making: but beleue that god is the onely iustifier / that is / oureselues then to be pronownced iustifyed / when god hath mey on vs and forgeueth our sinnes. It is sone said. God is iuste and iustifying / but out of the botome of our hertes paci∣ently with teares to aknowlege the grete∣nes of our sinnes and to fele ourselues iustly punisshed for them and so humbly to aske forgeuenes for onely crystis sake / is sampsons worke and hercules labor. Necessary / it is / this doctrine of repentā∣ce and contricion to be ofte and continu∣ally preched to yt chirches that thei might trwly aknolege their sinnes to God / and for their sinnes verely know it / all these calamities affliccions warre and plages to be powerd forth vpon them. As Ieremie saith. 5. Owr sinnes haue thrust all good∣nes from vs. And that in so doinge our lorde god declareth himself iuste & right∣wise in all his workis and is not the au∣tor of euil though thei apere euill to owe sinfull nature euil iuging of god whiche will haue the victory when he is thus iu∣ged.
But fayth must be the companion ofFayth must be annexed to trewe penance this cōtricion and setfast holde vpon the promises. As here daniel not onely saith / with the / oh sorde / there is iust dealinge & rightwysnes in punisshinge / but he ad∣deth also / with the is ther mercy and for∣geuenes / by which so ofte repeted, he play nely excludeth oure owne meryts / ad∣dinge / not in oure rightwysnes and iuste lyuing do we aske it of yt / but for thy great mercyes sake and for thy nowne anoyn∣ted crystis sake. Let vs therfore vse these prayers and exercise these doctrynes vn∣to the which both the publyke and priua∣te calamities shulde excite vs. And na∣mely now when the chirche of cryst is no lesse persecuted then it was in the Ba∣bylony exylie. Wherfore this prayer ought now in the congregacions to be as effectuously and as feruently sunge and sayd for the chirches as did daniel in his lyke troublose dayes. And whylis I was speking in myText. prayer and confessinge myn owne synnes and the synnes of my peple Israel / and layinge forth my supplicacion before the lorde my god for the holy hyll of my god / whylis I was (I saye) yet in prayinge / Afore in ye. 8. chap the man Gabriel whom afore I had sene in my vision / came swystly fleinge vnto
me and touched me aboute the eueninge oblacion tyme / teaching me / and speking with me saing. Daniel now am I comen forth to geue ye knowleg. Nethelesse asso∣ne as thou beganest to praye thy prayers were graunted fermely / but I am come to tell it the / because thou art so desyerou∣se to knowne these thinges / that thou moughtst in very dede by expresse worde knowe it / and vnderstande the vision. Here must ye returne to the vision of daniel in the later ende of the. 8. chap. cō∣cerninge Anticryst / wherof Daniel was more troubled then certifyed / which vi∣sion was tolde him to come to passe aftir a long tyme and was boden to close vp the vision / but so that this vision was euer in his mynde / studeinge therof & de∣syering to knowe it more clerely / & therfo∣re the aungell calleth him here ye man of desyers or couetinge to knowe these thin∣ges in his dayly prayers: but now at last he seing that the. lxx. yeres of their cap∣tiuite were past and more then. xl. yeres also ouergone he prayed most effectuous∣ly and feruently with expresse wordis as ye haue sene it. Wherfore ye aungell Ga∣briel is come to him to teache him more clerely of the vision. By this Daniels prayer and confession we ought to lerne
how studiouse and sorowfull we shuld be for other mens afflicciōs euen as for oure . It is therfore a great offence not to be moued with pitie at the plages of the peple comitted to thy cure and not to pray for them / which I confirme with ye exam∣ple of Samuel saying: Far fro me be this synne / that I shuld ceasse to pray god for you and to teache you the righte waye. Also in that the aungell came so swiftly and touched him spekinge with him so fa∣miliarely / it is shewed vs / the aungels to be the seruants and ministers to the chosen at all tymes redye to standby & te∣che the prechers and techers of the wor∣de in thinges concernynge oure helthe and saluacion. Also of the aungels wor∣dis saynge: Thy peticion was graunted ere thou beganest to praye / we be taught / that before we begyne to praye / oure peti∣cionsIsa. 65. to be hearde in heuen / the lorde say∣inge: Before they shall calle vpon me I shall answere them / whylis yet they be spekinge I will heare them. Also as Da∣niels example inflammeth vs to praye to God and to beleue oure prayers to be hearde before they be ended / euen so doth Gabriels example counforte vs to be∣leue aungels to be present wt be praying / and to fight for vs alwayes ayenst the ga tis
of hell. But Gabriel exciteth daniel to be attent that he might in very dede & in expresse wordes vnderstand the vi∣sion. Wherfore let vs heare Gabriel de∣claring playnly yt tyme of crystis coming / his death / oure redempcion / the ceassing of the Iewes ceremonies / the prechinge of the gospell / the takinge awaye of ye syn∣nes and vtter fall of the Iewes comon we all. And here is to be noted / that when the peple in captiuite thought all the pro∣phecies of cryst to be frustrate / and them∣selues almost in despayer: then god of his mercye conforted them with this assewe∣red promise of Messias to come saying: ☞ Lxx. hebdomades ther be prefixedText. and apointed for thy peple and forthy ho∣lyOf yt. 70. hebd. an hebdo. is 7. yeres space. cytie / and then shall synnes be consu∣med sealed vp and ouered / and iniquite purged / and the euerlasting rightwysnes brought forthe / visions and prophecies shalbe then sealed vp / and the moste ho∣ly one shalbe anoynted. Wherfore knowe thou and vnderstande it / that from the tyme wherin it is proclamed that Hieru∣salem be buylded agene / vnto the prince Messias: the be. vii. hebdomads / &. 62. hebdomads. For the streatis and wallis shalbe reedifyed: but a long and hard ty∣me ere they be seteled in quiet. Or (as ha∣the

Where and when we shuld begyne the rekening of these. 70. hebdo. which make 490. yeres / ther hath bene myche variāce amōge yt wryters / but now is ye prophecye of daniel. 12. chap. fulfylled / sayng: Many shall turne ouer this boke & there by shall their knowledge be encreaced. The text sayth: From the proclamacion of ye buyl∣dinge ayen of Ierusalem / but it sheweth not of whose proclamacion. Ther were. 2 proclamaciōs as ye reade in. 1. of Esdras. The first was geuen forth by Lyrus im∣mediatly aftir the ende of the. lxx. yeres in the first yere of Lyrus. And the secon∣de by Darius in his seconde yere aftir da∣niel had made his prayer. Betwixt the first proclamacion and the seconde there were. xlii. yeares in all the which tyme ye buylding ceassed and was letted nothing in a maner done / tyll the. 2. yeare of this Darius and then begane they a fresshe at his cōmandement and licence to buyl∣de / so that in the. 6. yere of Darius ye tem∣ple was finisshed. And aftir yt finisshinge of the temple / ther were. xii. yeres ere ye cyte and wallis were full made. And ther fore the text saith: That the streatis and wallis shalbe reedifyed / but in so harde
and troublose a tyme that long shall it be ere they be seteled therein as before. For there were. lxx. yeres from ye first lycence ere all was finisshed and the Iewes all returned and setled in Ierusalem. For as∣sone as the. lxx. yeres of their captiuite were expyred / the Iewes by the fauour of Lyrus / some repared into Iudea with gold and gyftis of the king Lyrus where with he bode them buylde their temple. Then as sone as they came there they buylded an altare & prepared themselues spedely to buylde their temple laying the foundacions therof: but they were letted of their purpose more then. xlii. yeares. Nethelesse at last vnder Darius Longi∣maneLxx. ye∣res in ca ptiuite / &. 70. in redify∣inge. the temple was buylded vp in. 4. yeares and dedicated. Aftir this / retur∣neth Esdras from Babylon which resto∣red their lawes and iugements and cor∣rected certeyn greate vices of the peple / and of the bisshops and preistis of the cō∣gregacion / which they had souktoute of ye gentyles and heythen, in those. 140. yeres brought vp amonge them. Aftir Esdras there came Nehemias from the captiuite into the holy lande / which restored and with wallis defended the cyte. This sto∣ry conteyneth. lxx. yeares. For from the first yere of Lyrus vnto ye. xx. yere of Da∣rius
Longimani there be gathered. lviii. yeres / & from thence forth to his. 32. yere (he raigned. 37. yere) are gathered. 12. ye∣res wherin the wallis and cyte were resto∣red / which all make. lxx. troublose yeres. Here maye we se the wrath of god ayenst synners punisshed and plaged aboue. 100 yeres / albeit they were his derely peculia∣re peple. But yet be we counforted ayen seinge at last how happely God stered vp Darius Longima. to accomplesshe their desyers.

The aungell calleth the space of these first. 7. hebdom▪ a straight or har∣de tyme / for because that whylis they we∣re buyldinge their cyte and temple / they were so molested & assawted of their eni∣myes lettinge and resistinge their buyl∣ding / that they wrought with one hande / holding their swerdis in the tother han∣de / nether made they their morter nor did other labours aboute it / but were gyrte with swerdis hauinge weapens redy by them / which difficultye techeth vs that the chirche of cryst with the gospell can∣not be edifyed withoute lyke difficultye and perell to the buylders and prechers / the aduersaries euer resistinge with con∣trary cōmandements / inhibicions & pro∣hibicions of emprour & kingis & greuou▪
se persecuciōs by their inquisitors / as we see it this daye / so strongly letted by the emprour / and popish kingis blaspheming the gospell with names of heresye / & the trewe prechers they call heretiques. Some begine to reken from the. 2. yere of Darius Longimane ending the. lxix. hebdom. (which contayn. 43. yeres) at ye baptisme of cryst being then. xxx. yere of age. And these men take the last hebdom. for the. 7. yeres folowing / that is sor the. 3 yeres & an half wherein he preched & was crucifyed / & for the. 3. yeres and half aftirBylian∣der & bul linger wt thirchi che. his resurreccion. other greate lerned and men of sharpe and syncer iugement / begine at the. 32. yeare of Darius Longi∣mane / and ende these. lxix. hebdomads iust at Crystis birthe diligently proued / first by the wordis of the aungell saying: Ab exitu verbi vt restituatur Hierusa∣lem / that is / from the full accomplishmēt of the thinge proclamed / concerninge the reedifying of Hierusalem / which accom∣plishment and full finishment of the wor∣ke was done in the. 32. of Darius Longi. Now from the. 32. yere of Darius Longi∣mane vnto the birthe of cryst be / 7. hebd. and. 62. hebdo. yeres 483. which accompt (because ye storyes of the Byble here ces∣sed by ye reason of so troublouse a captiuite
and tyme) is certeynly gathered of these lerned men by the Grekis Olympiad the most sewerst accompt and rekeninge. Now aftir these men remayneth the last hebdomade in which cryst was borne and slayne and Ierusalem destroyd. For this last hebdomade must nedis be of a nother rekeninge saye they multiplyed by. 10. to make. lxx. yeres / which space runeth be∣twixt the birth of cryst and the vtter de∣struccion of the comon weall of the Ie∣wes by Titus themprour of Rome. For the prophecie by these. lxx. hebd. recheth from the buyldinge of the cytie to the fy∣nall destruccion of the same as ye shall se it here playne in the text / wherfore it cannot ende in any one hebdo of. 7. yeres / but in ye hebd. of. 70. yeres / as did the spa∣ce from the first proclamacion by Cyrus to the finishment in the. 32. of Darius cō∣tayne lykewyse. lxx. yeares. Also it is to be noted that as ye aungell begineth his accompt at the Iewes full lybertie & full finishment of their temple and cyte / euen so endeth he his rekening in their full ly∣bertie and perfite saluacion offred them by cryste / and at their vtter destruccion for slayinge him so iently offred them. But me thinketh / that this nowmber of these. lxx. hebd. begun at Cyrus / shuld
not be so contynued / that the one and last hebdom. shulde immediately folowe the lxii. hebd. because the aungell hauinge rather a respect to the storyes and gestis done in ether of them / distributeth them into. 3. partes / firste geuing to the. 7. heb. the buylding of the cytie and temple with siche difficultie / and in the seconde noū∣ber of. 62. hebd. he geueth the persecucion to the Iewes vnder the seconde and thir∣de monar. vnto Antiochum / and so forth to the takinge awaye of the scepter from Iuda: aftir the which shame and obpro∣bry to the Iewes / he telleth them what shall come to them in the last hebd. for ye death and kylling of Messias. ☞ And therfore he sayth: And aftirText. the. 62. heb. Messias shalbe sleyne / & the Iewes vtterly vndone and destroyd.The se∣cond di∣stribuciō of ye he. That is / aftir the. 62. hebdo. be ended and the scepter taken awaye / cryst shalbe. slayne / but not immediately / for ther we∣re▪ 81▪ yeares betwixt the ende of the. 62. hebd. and the death of cryst. A lyke speche is it. That aftir the takinge awaye of the scepter / Sylo shulde come / but not imme∣diately / for he came not tyll. 47. yeres af∣tir the takinge awaye therof. Albeitkinge Cyrus of a good hert gaue them licence to departe and buylde their
cyte / yet was it not finisshed in his dayes For the good purposes of kings be oftyn tymes letted / for nothing can they do ex∣cept god saye Amen. The wrath of God for oure synnes / is the cause that with so greate difficultye ye temple of god is not yet finisshed / but rather letted so cruelly. But yet propter Christum promissum / for crystis sake promised vs / it shalbe at last although with great difficulty and losse of many a good manis lyfe finisshed. But here lo / was the Iewes cytie / temple andA moni∣cion for keisar & kingis. all their comon weall vtterly destroyd for the slayinge of cryste. Let all crysten em∣perours / kings and bisshops that yet slaye cryst in his members beware and wayte for a lyke destruccion. The text hath. Et nihil ei / that is / and nothing to him / Some vnderstand it of Cryste / As this might be the sence / Messias shalbe slay∣ne / and yet coulde they laye no cause wor∣they of death to him. Some vnderstande it of the Iewes as I haue translated it / signifyinge that because they shall putt him to death / they shalbe vndone and vt∣terly destroyd. For aftir that full mesure finisshed of their wykednes in denyinge and slaying their king / they shall nether haue any more kinge nor preist nor ruler nor temple nor cyte / no they shall nomore
be called the peple of god. For they cryed and denyed him to be their king / sayinge: We haue no kinge ouer vs / but the em∣perour and therfore it foloweth. ☞ For there shall come a mighty ar∣myeText. of the emperour & destroye both their cytie and temple. yea / their destruccion & ende shalbe as it were with a diluuie.Diluuie is nohes floude. And aftir the bataill their shalbe an vt∣ter perpetuall vastitude and destruccion of them. Lo / they refused their owne kinge cryst for the emperour / sayng: We haue no king but the emperour / and now see how benefi∣ciall themperour was to them: lyke wyse oure spiritualtye this daye refuse the go∣spell and cryst, geuing vp their auctorite powr and goods to emperours and kingis to defende their kingdome. But in shorte space shall ye see their seclare emperours and kings serue them worthely as Titus and his host serued the Iewes / their cy∣tie and temple. He compareth their mise∣rable destruccion to the floude of Nohe. For very fewe or none of the Iewes were left in Ierusalem so destroyd / but all were slayne or famisshed or dyed of the stinke and pestelent corrupcion of their dead in∣numerable carkases or els caryed awaye captiued as a vehement floude caryeth
all awaye with it. For very hard sharpe and bitter was that consuming siege and storme. The Romās with many / ofte / and diuerse assawtes bete downe the Iewes miserably / & aftir the batails were done there remayned a perpetuall vastite & de∣soacion. For neuer aftir was it / nor shall their Leuiti preished nor their kingdō of Iuda / nor the policye and comon weall of Moses nor cytie of Ierusalem be re∣stored. But as I say / Ieremei / O see sayd: Aftir that calamitose destruccion / shulde the gentils be called the peple of God / which enbrace the gospell as it is wryten Rom. 9. &. 10. Playne it is the Iewes of∣ten aftir this destruccion to haue had en∣forced to reedifye and restore their comon weall of Moses. For in ye tyme of Adrian emperour they gathered them thyther a great multitude inuadinge ye lande with armor. But Adriane puttynge them to flyght destroyd many of them. Aftir that / Iuliane the apostata / for the hatered he bore to the crysten religion / graunted the Iewes licence to reedifye their cyte & tem∣ple. The worke was Begune and miche money gathered to performe it. But with many terrible erth quais and flammes of fyer oute of the foundacion / the edifi∣cacion was throne downe and miche pe∣ple
slayne with the stones & tymber fal∣ling vpon them. Also Nazianzene telleth that their clothes were wondrefully stay∣ned thik with red figures of the crosse / as it were with blode imprinted in their clothes / wherfore the Iewes thus afrayd with these celestiall wondrefull signes left their worke and fled from the place. For god had decreed their policie neuer∣more to be restored. God wold haue thex∣ample of his wrath sene of all the genty∣lee to monissh vs therby / & that he wolde horribly and terribly punisshe and plage the contempt and crucifyinge of his sone (he is yet dayly crucifyed afresshe among the papistis) He will also that Moses co∣mon weall be buried with Moses nomore to be sene nor knowne / left the opinion & fayth in their ceremonies and rytes be cō firmed / men beleuing to be iustifyed with the Iewes by their rytes / ceremonies / workis and tradicions. Also one hebdomade shall confir∣meText. the couenant made with many men.The. 3 di stribuciō into one hebdom. And the middis of this hebdomade shall abolishe and abrogate sacrifice and ob∣lacion. Here he attribueth to the hebd. the sa∣me thinge that perteyneth to cryste. For cryst in this hebd. confirmed his testamēt and
& couenant (as Paul disputeth it largely to the Hebrewes) by his death & sacrifice once for all & for euer sufficiēt. This one hebd. recheth from the birth of cryste vn∣to the destruccion of the cytie / cōteyning lxx. yeres. In the middis of this hebdo. that is in the. 34. yeare of crystis age the Iewes fulfylled the mesure of their wy∣kednes by kyllinge him / and so were they worthely reiected. This hebdom. the aun∣gell diuideth in the middis geuinge the first half to cryst preching and suffering and to tother half to the peple and cyte to their sacrifices & rytes all to ceasse & be abolisshed. For himself hanging on the crosse sayd that all was ended / and en∣clined his head and yelded vp his spirit / which done / the veyle of the temple was kut in sondre from the hyghest to the lo∣west parte / that by these woundrose sig∣nes god wolde testifye to the herdnecked Iewes by the host and oblacion of his so∣ne all the figuratiue sacrifices now to be ceassed and gone. Well therfore sayth the aungell: In the middis of this heb. shall ceasse the hostes and sacrifices. But this thinge wolde not the Iewes beleue / but went on styll with their wont and som∣tyme holy (but now vnlawfull and to be abhorred) sacrifices to be offered. And ye
holy men which thus preched they perse∣cuted and banisshed & many they slewe for this so soden a gospell and new ler∣ning as do our phariseis. But yet did god by his long pacient suffrāce call them to repentance / by all the reste of this tother half hebdomade / euen. 35. yeres folowing yea and with threatenings he wold haue frayd them from their conceyued pertina∣te styffe malice / but all was in vayne / as ye see it lyke wyse this daye wherein weBeware within these. 15. yeres to come. 15. yeres to come. haue had lyke warnings these. 20. yeres. Here also maye ye see the figurall temple and cyte corresponding the verite / for as that materiall temple and cyte were buyl∣ded in those first. lxx. yeres next aftir ye captiuite / with so grete difficulty & anxt / euen so in this last hebd. conteyning also lxx. yeares / was the very cytie and tem∣ple of Crystis bodye the chirche with as grete perell and difficulty buylded and fi∣nished by his death in the middis of this hebd. as himself in ye middis of this heb. declared it saying: destroye ye this tem∣ple / & in. 3. dayes shall I reare it vp agene And I say. 53. confirmeth ye same / saying: With the perell of his owne lyfe shall he fynde ryches. Cryst begane to confirme & stablisshe his couenāt when he begane to preche his gospell adding the testimo∣nies
of the lawe and prophetis to confir∣me his doctrine. And when he was rysen he begane his eternall kingdō declaring himself to be the geuer of rightwysnes & lyfe eternall / he sent his Apostles to ga∣ther his chirche out of the gentyles / and endewed them with his spirit whom he sanctifieth gouernthe and endeweth dai∣ly with eternall lyfe, sight, knowlege, and withe his rightwisnes. These the very proper workis and benefits of cryste / the aungel calleth the confirmacion of his co∣uenant / euen the fre forthgeuing of his so plentuouse promises which were made to the fathers and prophetis as saith Ie¦remie. 31. Beholde ye dais shall come & I shal smyte vp a new couenant wt the hou∣se of Israel: I shall geue my lawe into their hertes and be their god &c. Here let euery godly reader remember & by faith set holde vpon this swete couenant and promise of god in cryste aknowleging wt thankis these so ryche and confortable be∣nefits / euen the delyuerance from sin de∣ath and hell / and the remission of sinnis in crystis blode with lyfe eternall geuen vs in cryste for his deathes sake. In the middis of this laste hebdom. I shall cease hoste oblacions sacrifices and all rytis and cere of the iewes. Oh heuye

But I cannot promise you so longe a daye no not 14 yeres to auoid this imminent plage: But geue me leaue to conster you this laste verse. Et super alampinnam vel portam obominationum vastator erit vel stabit.Text. That is to saye. And vpon the winged cherubims / pinacles / & gatis of the abo∣minacions shalbe setvp abominable de∣struccions. Why? Dare the aungell call the holy wingis of the cherubims, and pi∣nacles, phanes and dores of the holy tem∣ple / abominacions? yea trwly for aftir he had abolisshed his ritis & sacrifices ther in, by crystis dethe and yet wold the iews contrary to his will vse them there still / he abhorred all their leuitik ministracion in it. And therfore he permitted pylate to procure the signe of their present abomi∣nable destruccion to be setvp (& that not wtoute the bisshops great siewt) on euery
phane pinnacle and porte of the temple / yea and vpon the most holy (as ye wolde saye) highe altare as vpon the winges of ye cherubims ouer ye arke of gods testamēt Caligula did setvp his image. But what was this abominable signe of their de∣struccion? verely a golden splayde egle euen the emperours armes of Rome with their owne images euen yt present token of the wrath of god / signifyinge the Ro∣mans to come shortly / and miserably to destroye temple and cytie with all their comon we all onlesse they repented & en∣braced cryste. In euery place, pinacle, pha∣ne and vpon euery gate (as ye se images & pictures in oure chirches euen the abo∣minable signes of a lyke destruccion) had they set vp the baners of Tyberius and images of Caligule the emperours, which onely were not the signes of these abomi∣nable destruccions / but also all the false worshiping is ayenst crystis precepts we∣re the same signes to. But wherfore did Pilate and the bishops procure them the∣se abominable baners and images? vere∣ly they knewe that they had putt Cryst to death vnworthely as Pilate himself con∣fessed it / wherfore they were afrayd lest his innocēt blode wolde be anenged and required at their handis / & therfore to be
defended / they (as now do all siche lyke combrouse consciened clerkis and bisho∣pes / by settinge vp of these their baners and images of the emperours and kinges contend and siewe to gette their fauour / but all was in vayne. For vnder whoseThe sha∣meles shiftis & signes of oure spi∣rituals owne de strucciō. wingis they thought to haue socour / euen of the same wingis were thei clene wypt away & destroid: the spiritualtye thought to obtain the emperowrs & Pylats fauour by this meanis that they might with an euyll sciēce yet at the lest wyse defen∣de and escape their murtheringe of cryst and to cōtynew in persecuting & slayinge his apostles banisshe their doctryne and hold styll their owne synfull cerem▪ rytes & almaner idolatry / but it helpt them not. And haue not oure papistis set vp thessa∣me seculare wingis and images in their chirches? haue they not now made & set∣te vs vp newe articles of oure fayth & vn∣derpropped them wt the emperours swerde & policie of ye realme? haue thei not thrust in ayen all popish rytes / tradicions / sacra∣ments / misses / matens / diriges for their dead / processions / praying to posts / to sto∣nes / holy water / salte / false inuocacions with an hole rablement of significatiō and signes of an ab ominable desolation? haue they not put forth their pestelent bo∣kis
of their owne necessarye doctrynes / articles and institucions vnder the em∣perours and kingis wingis? Haue they not tormented and combred many a cry∣sten conscience with their forbidding the reding of the holy Byble compelling men to their misses to receyue & beleue their sacraments to geue grace / and men and women to lyue in perpetuall burnings / & violently deuorsinge lawfully maryed persons? yea they compell men to idola∣try and prophane the lordis holy souper. The place of prayer and preching ye pol∣lute with idols and yet compel ye men thither come to knele downe to crepe to kisse & to praye. Now tell me by your faith defende ye not al these execrable abomi∣nable signes of your owne destruccion? These these be ye very abominable signes of your vtter fa and desolacion whiche your selues haue setvp in the holy place & temple of menis hertis that shuld be the temples of god and also in euery chirche. Of these execrable abominacions cryste sayd when ye see them stande in the holy place / thē take hde and beware. For the heuey destruccion is at hand. Wherfor so sodenly fyl down all these abbeis? vere∣ly for because / their abominable idolatry in Messes images pelgrimages shrynes
and their execrable supersticiouse rytes and cerem. and their chosen holynes in fylthey vowes and dampnable hypocri∣sye stode in ye place where they ought not to haue stonden. And therfore there dro∣ped downe vpon them so miserable a per∣petuall destruccion euen the signe of go∣dis heuey wrath. Et super alam. And yet vpon the wyng. Loke therfore (my lordis) vnder whose wyngs and tytle ye yet per∣secute and haue shed so miche innocent blode / vpon whom ye faher youre actis / articles / enstruccions and institucions? For it foloweth. Abominationes desola∣tionum. That is / when ye see these exe∣crable abominacions kouered and defen∣ded with so mighty brode wyngis of the seculare armes / as though there dirst no∣man say nor wryte / reasn nor do / nor cy∣phre ayenst them / then be ye sewer of a so∣den irreparable miserable destruccion. Et vs{que} ad consmmationem dif∣finitam still a bitira dei super vastitatem pereuntem. That is / vpon these abominable de∣structiones or waastine abominacions shall ye wrath of god dpe downe tyll all be vtterly destroyd as it were with the floude of the lordis indignacion. He com∣pareth this heuey desolacion to ye dluye
or vniuersall floude of Nohe. For they shalbe so vtterly destroyd with this Ro∣mane floude that fewe or none shall put vp their headis as it were aboue the wa∣ters to escape. Out of the Egypciae and Babylony floudis of captiuite the Ie∣we once escaped / but in this Romane di∣luue thei all perisshed as did pharao wt his hoste in the muddie reed / or sedgie sea. And as the diluuye drowned not the worlde in one daye / but at last when the hyllis were allkouered / allwere drowned euen so did not the Romans at one assaw∣te and bataill destroye the iewes but thei we vexed long and with many stormes slaughters besiegis sedicions / afflicciōs famyns / pestilences and conspirisons by xxxv. yeres / & then in the ende of the ba∣taill whē god had thus / yere byyere drop∣ped down his wrath vpon them / he powe∣red forth as it were the vniuersall floude of his wrath vpon them / euen his ven∣geance / for all the sheding of the iust blo∣de of the prophetis / of cryst his owne o∣ne / and of the Apostles / to declare openly to the reste of the Iewes and to vs / that he had sent his promised Messias / which fulfyllinge the lawe concluded oure reli∣gion within the lymitis of fayth & loue / all the ceremonies of the temple both sa∣cred
and carnall abrogated. And therfore aftir their kingdome and preisthod were once anulled / it behowed not one stone vpon another nor vestigie of the temple to stand and remaine. Now therfore are we by this the iewes miserable destruccion taught & warned / that where so euer we se images / altars / misses / menis sacraments / rytes / cerem. tradicions / yea and menis actis and ar∣ticles stande in the chirches / red and pre∣ched out of the pulp its instede of the go∣spell / the sacramēts of god there propha∣ned and abused of prodigiouse viciouse papistis and anticristis / there be ye cer∣tayn to stand vp the very signes of a lyke vengeance shortely to be powered forth vpon the same regions / cities & chirches. Flye ye therfore now premonisshed out of siche regions and chirches as did the A∣postles at this prophecie of Gabriel out of Iudea into Galile / lest ye perisshe of the Turke as did the Iewes / destroyd by Titus. THese thre last chapters hang so to∣gyther that this. x. chap. maye be called the preface into the. 11. (1. 12. chap. In the which aftir the bataill of yt good & bad aungels for their prouinces / ther is treated a pronosticacion shewing
meruelouse thingis from the thirde yere of Cyrus vnto the world is ende / whiche thing is it profiteth miche the godly to knowe before they shall come. ☞ In the thirde yere of Cyrus king ofText. the Persies / there was a certayne verite shewed vnto Daniel called Beltsazar / and it was a verite concerninge a greate hyghe mater / which thinge he perceyued and vnderstode right well by the wordis & vision.

Here daniel turneth bak to the. 3. yere of Cyrus / wherin ye see the heuy face of the chirche of god. For those so ioyfull ty∣dings conceyued by Cyrus proclamacion of their returne and buylding of their ci∣te were now turned into great sorow and heuynes. For Cyrus perchaunce now go∣ne farre of to wage bataill with the Sci∣thans (his wyked sone Cambyses left in his stede) there went forth from Camby∣ses a contrary commandemēt. That the iewes shuld ceasse buylding their temple and cite. Cyrus faught vnhappely & was
slayne. Cambyses raigned. 6. or. 7. yeres. It chaunceth in ye courte to be many mu∣tacions / good men be there often exclu∣ded or els pressed with heythen supersti∣cions. And wyked rulers being euer eni∣mies to the trwe doctryne are called to ere rule. Daniel now lamented the ab∣sence and fall of king Cyrus. He was syke and sorowfull to se the name of god reui∣led / but greately it greued him to see the weaknes and peruersenes of the Iewes / of whom many casted awaye all hope of yt restoringe of their citie and temple / thin∣king themselues to be seduced of the pro∣phetis and of Daniel to. They had now casten awaye gods promises / mother ther were / which although thei did not vtter∣ly despeir yet they counseld their compa∣ny not to returne / but tary for a more tran quilite skorning them that were so haste∣lyWhen ye storye of Esther was done. gone home before.

Camby. Smerd. & Smerdem / which both were eni∣mies to the Iewes and to their religion. Thus aftir so ioyouse a begininge there
folowed a sorowfull successe. Some of theAhassae. Darius Longim. iewes preferring their owne ease and id∣lenes aboue their religion / were wode wt indignacion distractinge the myndes of other / and perswaded them to not beleue their prophetis / and thus they troubled daniel and other good men mynded to re∣turne. Siche is the fortune that abydeth the good pastors and trewe prophetis. Here haue ye the image of the chirche whom god willeth bothe to be exercised & whetted with affliccions and also pa∣ciently to abyde their delyuerāce.

For all the impedimentis by Cam∣yses and other tyll Darius Longi. came, were so decreed of euerlasting of god. By this vision was daniel and other good men conforted in those troublous ty∣mes / and we be therby also premonisshed of the present mutacions of empyres and kingdoms & of lyke calamities and de∣struccions which drawe faste vpon. Da∣niel was now nyer an. 100. yeares olde /
and syke for this sayde sorowe. In the. 24. daye of the first monethText. I was by the gret ryuers syde called Ty∣gris.Tygris so called of his swift∣nes. And when I loked vp / I sawe a man in a whight linyne vesture whose loynes were gyrt vp with glistering gold / whose bodye was beutifull lyke a violete or ia∣cinthe / his face lyke lyghteninge and his eyes lyke a burninge lampe / & his armes and feete so bright as any polisshed steell and the voyce of his wordis as it were the vehement noyse of a multitude. Now daniel describeth the tyme & pla∣ce of this counfortable vision and also yt face & estate of the persone sene. For god wold now conforte heuye daniel / and not onely of the mutaciōs of the empyres to come / but also of the calamities now pre∣assinge vpon the iewes before crystis co∣minge / & make them for this cause more certayn: that therof their posterite / & we might lerne with feare to call vpon oure zelouse God / and in fayth wayt fore oure sauiour cryste. This firste moneth is Ni∣san / oureNisan mar∣che. marche / wherin thei celebrated the memoriall passouer lomb in the remē∣brance of their delyuerāce out of Egypte The man whom he sawe was crist / whom hereaftir he calleth Michael and the so∣ne of man. A lyke descripcion is there of
him in the Apocal. 1. Wherof as some for∣mes be terrible / so be some of his parties pleasant and counfortable to beholde as both the psal. 44. & Isay. 11. describe him / teachinge vs that cryst according to his lawe and gospell / is with his gospell io∣conde and plesant to all godly men / & ter∣rible and fearfull with his lawe vnto all ye vngodly. And therfore is he thus payn∣ted of the prophetis. His sight to beholde∣is ferefull to them that shall wisshe the hills to fall vpon them to couer them from his countenance. And mighty and terri∣ble is that same his voyce and breath of his mouth which slayeth the vngodly. The reste of his body described is plesant and ioyouse to beholde to the beleuers. His whight vesture & so▪ to be a man mor∣tall therby / signifieth him / as daniel he∣reaftir saith / to be made whight with his crosse & passion / to enter into his glorye. But I daniel alone sawe this vi∣sion / andText. the men beinge with me did not see it / for they were smyten with so great feare that thei fled awaye and did hyde them. I therfore abyding there / alone did se this great vision / but my strength was all gone fro me / & my beutie & colour was turned into deformite. All my strengthe was vanisshed awaye.
o here ye see the wyked to not knowe cryst / & therfore to flye from him for feare: and yet he calleth all men to him promi∣sing to refressh them and to take all bur∣dens and heuye feare from them. But theMat. 11. beleuers heare and come to him and tary styll with daniel by him / thei see him & be llumined of him / albeit at firste whylis thei be vnder the lawe / thei fele in them∣selues no strengthe to fulfyll it / but they set holde by fayth vpon crystis fulfylling chalengynge it for their owne.

Furthermore I hearing the voyceText. of his wordis / as I had bene oppressed with sleape / was casten downe groueling vpon the earthe. And lo / with his hande he touched me / lyfting me vp yet creping on my knees and palmes of my handis. And he sayd vnto me: Daniel which art so desyerouse of thinges to knowe them / take heed to the wordis which I speke to the / & stond styll in thy place / for now am I sent vnto the. And when he had tolde me this / I stode vp tremblynge. But he sayd vnto me: Daniel / feare not. For in ye first daye that thou applyedst thy mynde

But how maye the seruant of this my lor∣de speke with this whiche is my lorde? euen now am I destitute of my strength / and I am so febled and faint that I can∣not take my breath. And then agene this man touching me counforted me / saying: Be not a frayd man so full of iust desyers peace be with the / & all feare set a part / be of good chere.

For the princes of the grekis and persies were de uils stering vp sedicions and persecuciōs in Grece and persie ayenst all godlines.

The grekis because thei excelled in wie & ryches / the deuil ste∣red them vp ayenste cambyses and were iwyse ouercomē in Cyrus days & brought into an heuy seruitute & therfore thei se∣diciously resisted the Persies.

For the same prince of the persies grekis and of all the worlde in all ages & especially in this laste age troubleth ve∣xeth persecuteth & laboreth to destroie the chirche of cryste and all comon wea∣lis. Wherfore god suffreth the good aun∣gels often tymes to haue the victorie of the euil / that peace might reigne vpon ye erthe and the godly to haue a breathinge tyme to reste them. Whilis I came to the saith the aungel / to tell the what is de∣crede to come and written cōcerning the crosse and persecucion to continew into so longe a tyme I did myne office to certi∣fye the & all godly men warninge you be∣fore of these persecucions that when thei come ye fal not frō the trwthe but therIoan. 16 to dye then to renye cryst.

That the euerlasting worde and so∣ne of god with his aungels be euermore present with his chirche in all oure afflic cions and persecucions to helpe vs / to thrust awaye the deuyll with all his im∣pes yet persecutinge and to destroye his workis / let vs paciently tarye for his hel∣pe ayenst these deuyllysshe vngodly per∣sons runninge and roringe in euery place enforceing with the Turkis and anticry∣stis powr to skater and destroye Christis chirche. yea ye prince of this worlde flyeth vpon vs with a more present destruccion and crueller armore / euen with the negli∣gence and tyrannye of emperour and kin∣gis / and blody bisshops which shulde de∣fende & noureshe chirches.

Let these therfore be examples etforth / not onely for all kingis / that in the feare of god and for the loue of cryste they might lerne to auoyde the horrible and terrible plagis of their vngodlynes / but these examples be also prescribed to
the chirche that we might be taught vn∣der all emperours and kinges to bere the crosse.

Wolde god there were now but one Iosis or Ezechias / which wolde karye Dauid and Moses about with him / that he might for crystis sake (as happely as did Alexander) fight in these troubles dayes the iust batails for the defence of the gospell ayenst these turkish anticristis.

This tower of crystes chirche and gospell shall there ne ther turke nor tyraunt throwe down. Of which chirche it is writen in the baletis of Salomon / to be as terrible to these an∣ticristis / as is the edge of an armie or ca∣stell laid full of ordinance.

But the lesse parte was it whiche fyl∣not from their god in that / and in this so troublouse a tyme. He saith expressely / whiche knew god: the knowleg of whom saith I saye shall iustifie many. For he shall reuele himself by his worde to this litle nownber whiche be to many in the eyes of the grete nowmber / for that thei wold haue vs all quenched and cannot / nether is the grete nowmber able to resi∣ste owr doctrine for when our aduersari∣es obiect / the lerned bisshops iugement / the emprowrs comandements his. 32. ar∣ticles of the doctours of louaine / kinges actes and articles / and the moste parte
withe their olde holy mothers customes so semely so decent so laudable & cetera. which be yet their present weake weapes and roten reedis / then let vs heare the voice of cryste in his trwe techers & god∣ly prechers / which in this present conflic te confuteth their false doctrine so clere∣ly with god is worde / as is the sonne / as it was sene of late in the disputacions at Auspurge / Spires / Raynspurge and Ba∣syle where the popis doish disputers Ec cius / Cocleus / Pighius / Alphons / Bar∣tholome Latimerus with al their dronkē draffe saks were with shame constrained to geue place to the lerned mē of the prin∣ces of germanye (were Eccius and pighi∣us neuer so fumish) as ye see them confo∣unded in the bokes writen ayenst them of the lerned answering to their calumpni∣ouse false lyes. Whilis the kingdom of ye bisshops was thought to be the chirche of god thē was not the trwe chirche known but nowe haue the disputacions and bo∣kes of the lerned / & the folisshe answers of the papisis declared the difference. But many (saith the aungel) shalbe smitē down with swerde and fyer &c. This is e∣uery day verified in euery realme cryste∣ned sence the gospell was offred them. This litle floke of Cryste thus destroid
apere to their aduersaries to haue litle or no helpe of the gospell & of god / nor yet any counfort at all: but yet out of that lit∣le helpe that so litle apereth to our anti∣cristis (whiche helpe is right grete to vs in the scriptures and promises of god wri ten for our consolacion and helpe) we fele bothe inestimable counfort and helpe euē in the middis of our affliccions & in ye de∣athe / when the moste parte and papistis iuge vs to be forsaken of god and man / as thei iuged criste to be / when his father toke his spirit into his handis & the third day reaised him vp agene. But many shal ioyne thēselues to vs (saith the aungell) deceitfully. Trowth it is / that there we∣re then / and be nowe many false brether∣ne / especiallyFalse bakbygh ting bre∣therne. sche as were fryres & mon kes strewed into many congregacions so me to be curats which vnder the preten∣ce of the gospell as longe as it apered to encrease and was not forboden / by gredi∣er begginge dissemblinge and flateringe bothe deceyued and betraied many / & yet thei scaunder & hurte vnder the same co∣lour many a simple and good man. Many there be of these dissembling deceyuers & preuey false rethern euen mo then of the wthe verely. But at that tyme there we re many that fayned thēselues to e the
frendis of the Machabis / butall was to destroye them. As ye bisshop Alcmus ioy∣ned himself fraudelently to the host of ye godly ayenst Antioch{us} / which by the same deceyte slewe many godly citezens of the Iewes. And here is to be noted. That af∣tir the returne from Babylon vnto Anti chus dayes / there were rulers and prin∣ces of the stok of Dauid ouer the Iewes / but yet without the name of a king / being nethelesse in a mean autorite as capi∣tainesWhen ye bishops of the Ie wes beg to rule. and leaders into bataill.

A lytle before this destruccion by Antioc. was Iannes their capitain slayn of An∣tiochus in the sege of Iericho. Aftir that thei were without a seclare goid. And the bisshops stroue amonge themselues / one kyllinge another / set a fyer with desyer of honor / rule and ambicion / corrupted with all maner mischeif / so that thei blotted∣out the lawe of God / thrustinge in their owne lordely tradicions / as thei haue do∣ne this daye. Which is an eiident token
that the world is nyghe the ende and cry ste shortely to come to iugement. But as when the very chirche was de∣stitute the ordinarie powrs and seculare gouerners / that godly Matathia exhor∣ted the lesse part to resist ye furiouse king / euen so now haue we the holy spirit exhor ting vs to resist with his worde their fal∣se doctryne and to tell both emprour and kinges and bisshops. That we ought ra∣ther to obey God then men. Here is it playn that euer shall the emprours / prin∣ces / kinges / bishops and the seculare sort be the most parte ayenst crystis trw chir∣che. Also as then did Alcimus the bishop associate himself deceytfully with fraude vnto the lytle flok of the godly into the destruccion of many good men / euen so do the false brethern & falser anointed bis∣shops and popish preistis this daye. And many which neuer were of vs / shall (as Ioan sayth) forsake and go from vs to ye contrary part. For in the tyme of persecu∣cionLuk. 2. the thoughtis of many false holowe hertis shalbe reueled and layd open / then shall men be tryed as it were with fyer. And many shall turne their myndes / so∣me for feare of losse of their goodis and syues / some for the displesure of ye powrs / and some for dignities and lucre shall re∣nye
the verite and full bak from the faith and become cruell persecutors. Which when they shulde haue bene tried with fyer to be made whyght / thei became ve∣ry blak Belialis / when by the same crosse and fyer ye lerned godly techers be tryed / polisshed and made as whyght as syluer for a certeyn tyme apointed of god / aftir which tyme there shalbe a nother worlde The tyme of oure persecucion shall not long endure. Here is lo / oure consolacion for albeit oure aduersaries thinke vs to be vttterly forsaken and that oure perse∣cucion shall euer last / yet hath god apoin∣ted vs a tyme of oure reste and delyuerā∣ce / wherin we shall reioyse. And as ye ie∣wes at that tyme were counforted with ye hope of crystis coming then at hand lytle more then an C. yeres to come / euen so be we now conforted with crystis coming to iugemēt which we truste shall not so long tary to delyuer vs and to cast downe ours and his enimies into perpetuall paines. Which shall for his chosen sakis shorten the dayes of this synfull worlde. Of the hole story of this Antiochus Epiphanes / read the boke of the Machabeis. THis. 12. chap. first contayneth theChap. 12 lyuely descripcion of Anticryste / Whose first colour is to cōtempne
goddis worde: secondly / he is painted ofThe. 6. prophe∣ties of anticrist his pryde. Thirdly / setforth in his pros∣perouse successe. Fowrthly / he is knowen of his contempt and despysing of matri∣monye. Fyfte of his idolatrie. 6. Of his large giftis. Aftir these colours▪ secondly  is his fall described / and what shall hap∣pen ayenst him / and by him ere he fall / as first / what & who shall stand ayenst him / how he shall destroye the most pleasant londe. And who they be that Anticryste shall not ouercome. And who shalbe de∣ceyued of him. His death and fall / & pla∣ce wher he shalbe destroyd. Thirdly this  chap. techeth / that the crystianes / name∣ly the confessours and techers of the gos∣pell / shall before the last iugement suffer the most greuouse persecucions / but thei shall wresile oute of them thorow Cryst / beinge defended euen ayenst the gates of hell. The. 4. place treateth of the gene∣rall  resurreccion of oure bodyes / euen the last consolacion of the cristians. The. 5. is of the vertew and power of the mini∣sters of the worde before the iugement / and of the eternall rewardis astir oure  death. The. 6. teacheth what reader shalbe profited and lerned by readinge daniel. The. 7. sheweth the tyme of the  delyuerance of the chirche and of the re∣surreccion
of ye dead. The. 8. expowneth /  wherfore the prophecie of Daniel is so harde / and whom it profiteth. The. 9. pla  ce is of the tyme of the ende of ye worlde. The tenth hath an example of the resur∣reccion of the dead. But this kinge shall do what him∣self lysteth. And shall extoll and preferreText. himself aboue all the goddis or aboue the most hyghe god. And ayenst ye most hyghe god ouer all shall he speake horrible blas∣phemies. And it shall prosper well with him / vntyll gods wrath be consumed vpō him / and the impiete of the wyked be at the rypest. This is the lyuely descripcion (vnder the persone of Antioc.) of oure two cruell anticrystes: that is to writ / of the Sara∣cenik fyerce beast the Turke / and of his blody brother oure holy horned hypocrite the Romane Pope. Whom by their bitter frutes ye maye knowe as the tree by hir sower crab. First by the contempt of god∣dis almighty worde. For where the aun∣gell sayth: That this kinge shall do what himself lyst / and satisfye without any re∣raint or restraint his owne lustes & plea∣sures: he signifieth the turke and the po∣pe with their coniured hornes to be law∣lesse / nether to goddis worde nor to their
owne lawes to be subiect: but all thinges that thei lyst to be lawfull. Hytherto per∣teineth this .4. verse of the .x. Psalm. This vngodly casteth vp his nose & des∣pisethThe .4. verse of ye. 10. psal. aftir the Hebrew. all other / in al his mischeuouse wy¦ked cogitacions he setteth naught by god Not onely the turke / Mahumete / the po∣pis of Rome / their cardinale / bisshopes / monkis / preistis and fryers haue playd / and yet play this parte / but also all em∣prours / kinges and princes / which ensen ced by their serpētine perswasions / haue & yet do persecute and suppresse the gos∣pell / which (now the daye of their mercy∣full visitacion by the gospell offred them) yet wyll thei (the aungell calleth anticrist a kinge) do what thei lyst / make what pro∣clamaciōs and articles of oure fayth thei lyst / as doth the emprour this daye in the nether parties of Germanie strayghtly commanding no printer to printe / nor bo∣ke seller to sell any godly boke to the edi∣fying of crystis chirche nether in dewche Latyne / Frenche / English / Spanish nor in the Italion speche. Secondly he is described of his pryde. He shalbe extolled and thrust vp himself aboue and ayenst the moste high god: spe∣king horrible and meruclouse blasphemi∣es ayenste him: Here was it prophecied.
That Anticryste shuld not onely sitte in2. thes. 2 the temple of god / but that he shall proud¦ly lift vp himself (as Paul prophecieth it of this place takē) aboue euery thing that is called god / but also by his doctrine fi∣ghting playn ayenst the gospell / contume¦liousely skorne god and cryste / and accur∣se and excommunicate his chirche / as it standeth in the .10. Psal. His mouthe is ful of malediccions. We exhorte therfore as many as we may for the glorie of god / that thei sepa∣rat themselues from this vngodly facciō both in iugement & will: as did the Mac∣cabeis exhorte many to auoid the compa∣ny of the counsels confedered with Anti∣ochus / we warne also the lerned and pru∣dent / which yet for the studie and zele of peace (as thei wolde be sene) or for a cer∣tain singulare precise morosite / wolde a∣pere to abhorre and estiewe these new fa∣cions and soden mutacions (as thei call them) being alto ware / to wise and to cha∣rely circumspecte in this their slake san∣tering / leste their rasshnes (as thei pre∣tex it) shuld confirme the enimies of the gospell / therfore decree thei thus to stād still / lyke idle idols / and in securite as it were afarre of loking vpon and beholdin∣ge the bront of the bataill / no handis put∣ting
forthe / nor yet once (whē thei might) to helpe to any amendement or reforma∣cion. But the mater is to manifest and to farre gone / as may easely be perceiued of men of clere iugement not being corrupt with any affeccions.The rea¦sons & ob¦ieccions of our ad¦uersari∣es solu∣ted by Philip melanc. But here thei say / that in healing the∣se euills and enormites / we do more hur∣te then good / as to make tumultes sedici∣ons and cause the peple to rebell ayenste the magistratis and the ordonarie powrs and thus geue them the brydle to all licen ciouse libertie. And by this example and occasion the curiose persons shall trouble the trwe doctrine. We see (say thei) the Anabaptists / the Seruetis / the cāpanes the loites / georgiās / dauides / and other pestlences encrease at your steringis. As whē some of the hyders headis were smi∣ten of / other headis arose vp of their blou¦de. Euen so these deceiuers in this or that one place repressed / yet shall there other as euill sectis aryse in other pla∣ces say you. ye aske be what enterpri∣ces take the great men vpon themselues? with what discipline suffer thei their ma¦ners to be ruled? Howe diligent (I praye you) be thei to nourish godly studies and scoles? Whother translate thei the chir∣che and abbey goodis? What thinke ye? Is not this distraccion and diuision of
princes now emonge themselues an infi∣nite and sufficēt euil? We se it (saye thei) that nether great nor small maters can thei with a comon consent bringe well to passe. At laste thei say / If now the begin∣ings of this stryfe be so perellouse / what shall chance (thinke ye) vpon owr poste∣rite when there shalbe lesse lerninge and then by the lenger custome the audacite of grete men shalbe the more confirmed? yet is there nowe in princes some zele to godlye doctrine. Siche a study & zele shal there not be in their childern. Wherfor if ye wil nedis haue althings sodenly chā∣ged (say thei) ye shall encreace fiercenes and crueltie. These thinges thei saye a∣yenst vs when we rebuke their errours ty rannye / and open mischeif. And ful grete sorows do these heuey sighthes bring vpōtheir ca∣uillaci∣ons solu ted. vs. Ciuile discordis gēder infinite euils and perels. But yet is it an vniuste yea an vngodly towche to caste the cause of discorde and licenciouse rebellion vpon ye peaceable gospell. For thei that rebell & wilnot obay god nor his trwthe / but de∣fend their owne lyes and erroneose affe∣cti ayenst the open verite / thei (I say) by their sediciouse studies stere vp these vprores. Images and all false opinions muste geue place to the almighty voice of
god. These abominacions when thei be defended pertinatly of the enemies of the gospel / then their stifnecked pertinacie inflammeth discordis. And euen these be the comon and worthy present plages of all cristen realmes now set on fyer withe bataill. I thinke there was neuer a faye∣rer and goodlyer realm then was Egipte constituted of Ioseph / and yet did Mo∣ses sament it to be vtterly destroid for re∣pugning gods message and withholding his peple in bondage ayenst his will And miche more did Ieremye bewaeil and so∣rowe the destruccion of Ierusalem / the tē ple and the iews comon weall. Nowe con sider the tyme of Antiochus the figure of owr anticristes / and thou seest euen the i∣mage of owr present plages and calami∣ties in the storie of the Maccabe. Few or almost non / was the nomber of the godly vnto whom yet were there ioyned many vayn light / false / and deceitfull persons. The princes could not agre amonge thē∣selues. Their cheif leader and defender of the godly died before the ende of the batail / as nowe of late the cheife main∣teiners / writers / and prechers of the gos∣pell haue bene taken awaye. But yet shall the beter and lest parte haue the victory. But what confusions and destrucciōs of
the iewes londe folowd that persecuciō? Trewly Matathias toke not to him his weapens to the entent that his neuei hir can{us} shuld be a autor of the saduceis fal∣se doctrine / nor yet that his childers chil dern shuld constitute their kingdom with mutuall murt her slaying so cruelly the ci tesens. Nether yet that their childers childern / as were the The banes (brether ne emong themselues) shuld with wiked wepens and batail one kil a nother trou∣blinge the religion and bringinge in vpō them the Romans to prophane their tem ple. For it is manifeste that aftir the ba∣tail of Antiochus Epi. the iws were gre uously plaged withe the domestik tyran∣nye of the posterite of the Maccabes / wc were their bisshops and preistis. So that euermore shal the new stormes ouerwhelthis did Philip write in an. 1543: me the chirche. And albeit ye present state of our chirche apere yet to be tollerable al thoughe she wanteth not hir trouble and present persecucions / yet with in these fe we yeres there shal an heat be kindled in princes hertis / and so y litle & litle / the succession of the tymes shal after the prin ces mindes / yea and euen the myndes of the lerned shalbe changed / and all / bothe the seculare and ecclesiastik sorte shalbe distracted from the trwthe vnto reuen∣ginge
one another with warre. And thenPhilips prophe∣cie was fulfilled in ye yere folowīg & so for∣the. shall ther be an harder seruitute of the chirche / and false doctrines shall folowe (This was verified the laste and this ye re when the keisar did set forth his wiked precepts and 32. articles of the Doctors of Louayne). But let vs obey the comandement of god not doutinge himself to gouern our iournei and course vnto the ende / and his wrath to be apeaced. And if men go forth in their mischeif persecutinge his worde and chirche / there abideth them a heuey miserable destruccion / as did fall vpon ye iewes. But this one thinge dare I promi se our superciliose arrogant Ariopagites that so longe s thei thus persecute and thinke therby to haue their kingdom ayen in tranquilite and peace / and so longe as thei suffer not the gospel to be preched fo∣re fear of commocion / but thus violently suppresse it / that god shall plage them & all cristendom with perpetuall batail fa∣myn and pelence / wherof there shall fo lowe mutaciōs of imperies and realmes / grete changes of euery estate ad degree There arose in grece batail amonge thē∣selues wherby their cheif cities were al∣most vtterly destroid / as platea / Corcyra Athens / Sparta. It was their apoynted
plage of god for their wiked vngodlynes idolatry & echerie. And the heuier & gre∣noser was their plage because thei had not gods gospell to counfort them and to delyuer the beleuers. For it is the moste great benefit of Gods mercie to kindle∣forth the light of the gospell when siche heuei mutacions and destrucciōs drawe nighe / as many ensamples haue shewed it / and euen nowe doutlese there hange ouer all realmes crystened great and so∣den heuey changes. Wherfore that some congregacions might be sustained & con∣forted with the trwe knowledge and very inuocacion / and their heuines mitigated god hathe sent vs his gospell as the most present helpe and consolacion in the mid des of these miserable mutacions which if we repell / so caste we from vs our coun forte. It was not the gospell that brought the turke (I speke of present examples) into hongarie & Oestenrik. Nether was it gods worde that brought the english∣men into Scotland and into France. It was not the gospel that brought Martin van Rosse before Anwerpe and to spoile a great parte of Brabant / it was not the gospell / that drowned Rome and selonde It was not the gospell that brought the emprowr into so many euill chaunces in
his warres aftir he fled from ye counsels and dyd no good but dissembled with the Germans. It is not the gospell that ma∣keth this vniuersall derthe of vitaill & of all thinges. It is not ye gospell that shall bring in the Turk vpon vs. It is not the Gospell that nowe plageth all realmes with warre? It is not the gospell that ca∣steth downe abbeis and bisshopryks brin∣ging them into this obprobrious obloquie and cōtumelie. It is not the gospell that committeth the crysten princes to gyther one to destroye other. But it is the very violent denyinge and thrustinge awaye and persecucion therof and of the trewe prechers. It is their fyerce madnes in idolatrie and their making of newe arti∣cles with all youre other synfulnes and abominacions that hath and shall dayly plage all crystendom. What (I pray you) profited it Hunga∣rieThe coū sell of ye bishops of Hun∣garie. the sage counsels of their bisshopes and preistes with their impes to commā∣de the gospell not to be there preched nor receyued for feare of commocion and dis∣sension / and then we beinge at discorde (sayd they) emonge oure selues / a greate occasion is geuen to the Turke to inuade the londe? And as this was their policie to auoyde the Turke (yea rather to bring
him in vpon them in dede) euen so vse and practise oure emprour / kinges & bishops now the same wyse policie lo / vnto this daye. But as it came to the Hungarions / and to other realmes / euen so let the reste loke for lyke mutacions and worthei pla∣ges. Men ignorant of the gospell / what counfort / what helpe & delyuerance haue thei in siche anxts? verely non at all: but by their humane policie thei thinke to be salfe. Sed vana salus hominis. but vaynPsal. 59. is the helpe and helth loked for by manis policie / sayth the lorde. It is therfore the lyght of the gospell that bringeth conso∣lacion in these afflicciōs vnto godly men / which though theise themselues to be op pressed with the most heuye seruitute / yet be they assewered / not to be vtterly de∣stroyd / which by their prayers in fayth mitigate these plages and put the perll from the beleuers / for so greate and pre∣sent is their helpe as is their fayth con∣stant. And therfore do ye superciliose hygh lokes of oure papistis erre farre out of the waye / thei be deceyued and thei deceyue other / if they thinke their owne wittes / opinions / counsels and policies to be the infallible destined tables / and that all∣thinges muste so come to passe as they haue decrede / and that from their set pur posed
counsels and decrees / not god him∣self maye swrue. But herken / o ye folesIsa. 29. what the spirit of trewth telleth you / say∣inge. Because this peple draweth nyghe me with their lyppes and with their mou thes speke miche worship by me / their her tis being so farre fro me / and because the worship that they shulde geue me / they geue it me aftir their owne deuise and af∣tir the doctryne & precepts of men / ther∣fore behold / I meself shall do to this pe∣ple a thinge to be wondred at aboue me∣sure. I shall destroye the wysdom of their wyse men / & the vnderstandinge and for∣casts of their men of moste actiuite & po∣licie shall haue a fall. Wo be to them that so depely drowne themselues in their ow∣ne policie that they thinke to hyde their thoughts and counsels from the lorde &c. To whom speketh God here? not to oure papistis thinke ye? We see it and know it spoken vnto them as oure present dayly examples teche vs. Wherfore we render vnto God the eternall father of oure de∣lyuerer Iesu Cryst hyghe and immortall thankis for that he hath ayen kindled to vs the lyght of his gospell. Wherfore let vs praye to god in fayth and in innocēcye of lyuinge and be not afrayd of the false iugemēts and falser perswasions of the∣se
preistis of Baal. Let vs enbra∣e the gospell / loue and reuerence the ve∣ry trewe chirche / let vs knowe the godly not to be called to slughisshnes and idle∣nes / but vnto the most hardeste sharpe and ieoperdest batails. The tokens and markis of oure anti∣crystisthe mar∣kis of an∣ticryst. therfore must be well knowen. The deuyll diuerse ways layeth a wayt for all men. Some he exalteth into pryde. Some he wrappeth into lecherouse lu∣stes: some he combreth in couetousnes / murther / theft / destrucciō of realmes / ra∣pe and into a false fayth he bringeth ma∣ny & blydeneth them with false opinions and falser religions. Agenst this aduer∣sarie it behoueth to fyght buisily / but how and when / well know the godly. We must holdfast ye doctryne delyuered vs of god. And in fayth must me aske helpe of him onely for crystis sake. Oure myndis must be confirmed with his promises / lest euyll temptacions take vs. The deuyll hath yet his instruments / euen the pope / car∣dinals / bisshopes / preistis and fryes / about emprour and kinges to water yet a fresshe the popes gardens. And their fa∣ther sathan hath yet other instruments / euen the Epicures which wryeth & wrest all religions vnto their owne profite and
pleasures / yea and euen the gospell the abuse vnto their owne lucre taking it for a ieste and storie made by man: yea & euen thei that wold seme to be the pillers and edifiers of the chirche and defenders of the gospell / defende their misses / images idolatrie and seduce menis myndis from the trwe inuocacion and worship of god. These menis kingdom is contained vn∣der the name of anticryst / and is to be ab∣horred. Some simple sorte are gretely de∣ceyued with this reuerend name of the holy mother & catholike chirche / which thei geue to the gay place and prowd prei∣stis onely. And therfore thei thinke it im∣possible to be any knauerye or errours in so holy fathers with their meretrik mo∣ther. But the souper of the lorde haue theyPhilip. Melanc. The pro∣phanaciō of the lor∣dis sou∣per. prophaned and polluted most horribly wt many errours.

And most falsely say thei / thē∣selues to offerre vp dayly and often theTh. 2. mark. sone of god / and this their oblacion to de∣serue for other men (by the vertew of the dede it self) grace / remission / and helpe ayenst all bodely peress and deceases.
These fylthey lyes and prodigiouse pro∣phanacions of so holy a souper haue hor∣ribly kindled ye wrath of god. Euer hath the chirche beleued the workis comman∣ded of god to be the worshipinge of God and oure dewties wherin we please God. Nether is god worshiped with rytes and cerem. inuented of men be they neuer so decent & laudable before men. Sayth notLuk. 16. Cryste: Whatsoeuer is hyghely estemed lauded and praysed for decent & holy be∣fore men / is abominable before god? For if these their decent rytes and cerem. we∣re godis worship and honor / so shuld the heithen rytes and cerem be decent & lau∣dable seruices and worshipinges of god. In this error the anticrystis fayn the re∣ligion of monkis / fryers &c. and the sole lyuinge of preistis to be hyghe seruice to god / and therfore forbyd thei all these or∣ders to marye / and thei ende the lawfull maryed in sonder most cruelly / when this their deuilysh lawe of their wyueles cha∣stite is the most cruell tyranny bringinge many thousands to dampnacion / whose myndes and bodyes for this vnlawfull bonde are deadly polluted / whose souli by this one lawe be so letted that thei ne∣uer can rightly call vpon god / and ther∣fore by the comon consent of all godly men
it ought to be abolisshed. These anticry∣stisMarke this wel transforme the chirche into a ciuile kingdom and into the policie of the real∣me / tyering it with decent ciuilactis and rites / which apisshe imitaciōs ar the cau se of all these errours & mischeif brought into the chirches. Thei attribute to Pe∣ter and to his successors (as thei call thē∣selues) powrto translate kingdoms / and to the bisshops thei geue autorite to ma∣ke newe articles of our faith. And them∣selues to geue the same to emprour kings and princes / as did Iason and Merilai∣us to cruel Antiochus and to make newe worshipings and seruices to honor God. These bisshops vsurpe a seclare lordely powr to interprete scriptures / whiche to flater princes thei geue it also to kinges / ne noceant / to hold them to frendis / & yet is the trwe interpretacion of the scriptu∣res the gift of god / as is the institucion of gods seruice and worship limited withe his prescript worde / and with no powr ge uen of men. And to be short. The lordly∣nes and dominacion of the bisshops / is nowe all contrarie to the gospell. And whē we at the laste counsell (the emprour and the lord is of germany beinge present with all the lerned) monished iently the∣se bisshops of these enormities yet wyll
thei moste proudly and pertinatly defend still their idolatry and open errors conui∣cted there openly of the same / yet forbyd thei the gospell of trwthe to be taught: & with tyrany aboue any Nero or Dioclecia neslay thei godly mē for the profession of the gospell. Their owne partinate pryde wetingly resistinge gods worde therfore declareth them to be the very anticrystis here prophecied of daniel. Nether be the controuersies wherof we disputed / obscu∣e / but were clerely then cōfuted & percei ued of al men. The cause why so many dis sent from vs is. That thei be epicures or hipocrites blyndened & bewitched withe the false auctorite of the pope and his car dinalls and bisshops or with the vayn cō ceite of their owne carnall wisedom and policie / of which it is writen in this cha. thus. Al the vngodly shalbe with oute vn derstanding. Wherfore let vs not be mo∣ued at their wiked iugements and ordinā ces to consent to their errors & idolatrye / so to helpe their furyose madnes. Now ye se anticristis kingdom & who be the prin∣ces therof / wherfore it is sone seen vpon whom the text is verified. Nowe to the text ayen whence I haue digressed.Text. And it shall prosper with him vn∣tyll Gods wrath be consumed and spent
vpon him and ye impietie and wykednes of the vngodly be at the rypeste. For the contempt of the gospell / shall the wrath of god suffer the turke and the pope with strong delusions and effectuo∣se errors to destroye many soulis and bo∣dyes / but it shall dure no lenger then that his wrath consumed / shall ceasse / & their wykednes be rype / which shalbe when with his cleare cominge he shall thruste downe anticryst. Anticryst shall prosper in the mean tyme in his mischeif / for he2. thes. 2. shall do and haue what he lyste / he shall haue helthe of bodye / ryches / princely ho nor / dignities / his pleasure ouer women / victories / yea and what he will / as to per secute to make lawes &c. which is a token of the continuall consuming wrath of god hanginge ouer his head / as is the crosse and affliccion of the godly the token of gods loue towerd them. When anticry∣stes wykednes is rype and at the hyghest in persecuing / as is this daye the wyked nes of the emprour pope & other kinges / then let them beware / for now will the wrath of God ceasse to suffer them here any lenger to lyue. ☞ He shall set naught by ye god of hisText. fathers / nether shall he regarde the con∣iugale loue in wedlok / nor sette a wght by
any god at all / for he shall exalt himself aboue all thinges. Christ was promised to the fathersThe. 4. &. 5. ma kes. being their God / and therfore shall anti∣cryst deadly hate him / because he promi∣seth to the repenters remission of their synnes & lyfe eternall for the onely fayth and confidence of his mercye promysed them. The turk calleth vpon Mahumete and wilbe iustifyed by the workis cōman ded in Mahumets lawe / the pope calleth vpon the deade saintes and wilbe iusti∣fyed by the workes wryten in his owne de∣crees and lawe. In this verse ye se two manifest markes of anticryst printed both vpon the turke and the pope and their se∣culare princes yet folowing their stepis one euident marke is. They shall not knowe ne vnderstand what God is / but openly caste awaye the God of oure fa∣thers Abraham / Isaac and Iacob &c. one god alone for all sufficient him onely our fathers called vpon in cryste / theirs and ours onely mediator. Vnto him onely in all affliccions we and they dyd euer flye in the fayth of cryst oure sauiour and one∣ly mediator. And were hard and holpen by his mercye / oure fayth teching it vnto crystis passion paste / as dyd theirs vnto his death to come / ther by both they & we
to be iustifyed. But this our eternall god and father thus knowen in Cryste / shall oure anticrystis (sayth the aungell) neuer knowe nor regarde / but spyghtfully set him at naught and caste him awaye for their idols setvp in his stede both in their owne hertis and in their chirches to be worshiped aftir their owne inuencions / inuocacions &c. Thei shall inuent their newe iustificaciōs newe articles / remis∣sions / indulgences and saluaciōs by ma∣ny other means and mediators then by onely Cryste. These anticrysten keisars / kinges and bisshops shall teche and de∣fende most cruelly their own strange god of their owne makinge made with their mouthes and hands. And as tyranously shall they fyght for their owne inuented iustificacions and inuocacions of their dead saints: for their owne merits / will workis / and satisfaccions / rytes / cere. &c. Then shall thei pray to / and for the deadIsa. 63. which nether heare nor know them. And when thei be thus casten vp of God tho∣row their owne lustes into a forlorne myn de. Rom. 1. Then shall ye see their fifte5. mark. mark euen to contempne the honest law∣full cōiugale loue of men and women de∣syering to be coupled in holy wedlok. God hath created the man and woman & graf∣fed
into ether sexe a mutuall loue to be ioyned togyther in wedloke / lawfully to bringforth frute / one to haue a counforta∣ble felowe helper of the tother. This na∣turall coniugale loue shall they vtterly destroye forbidding the lawfull matrimo∣nie of preistis and of all their religious fonde vowesses. And shall set vp therby wheredom aduoutry and all prodigiouse lecherie vnder an hypocritish cloke of vn lawfull lawfull vowes and sole vnchast chastite. So that by this deuillish doctry∣ne and prohibicion many a man and wo∣man1. Tim. 4 is dishonested shamed viciated and polluted / yea and many a soull dampned. Siche forbidders of wedlok shall neuer haue good successe and fortune in their owne maryages. And as for oure bisshops and preistis the autors of this anticrysten act / they be so depely and so openly marked with this baudy bronde and popish print / that whoso see their shauen crownes / as they be afrayd of their familie wyues & daugh ters and abhorre their to ouermiche do∣mestike familiarite / so do all the worlde speke shame of their open prodigiose le∣cherie. These be lo / the monstrose mar∣kes of oure anticrystis both seculare and ecclestastike / euen the manifest blasphe∣mie
and contempt of god in worshiping images and strāge gods and their deuil∣lish doctryne prohibyting lawfull marya∣ge and violently rendinge honeste law∣fully mared persons in sondr with their derely beloued chyldren / thus to confir∣me their owne wyde wandering wyueles lecherous lustes. I tremble and shake for very shame & fear to tell the horrible viciouse lyues & abominable fylthynes committed among themselues and with menis wyues / wherof all the romish ram∣mish preistis and bisshops so stinke that all honest men stoppe their noses / eares and eyes at them. This anticrysten kingdom reteyneth the name of god the eternall father & his sone cryste. But thei adde to idols & cor∣ruppe the trewe doctryne: both in praying to the dead and worshipinge of idols and images / emong ye which idols their misse is the most execrable abominable signe of a swift and soden destruccion shortly to fall ouer them. And as for the trewe inuo∣cacion of god thorow cryst / thei haue tur∣ned it into a dowtfull dubitacion. In oure sorowfull repentance and contricion / so long as the mynde dowteth / & is not cer∣teynly perswaded of remission of hir syn∣nes / he knowth not God in Cryste / but▪
flyeth from him to dead saintes and dome idols. The crystians in this maner of inuocacion differre not from the turkes Saracens and iewes / whiche al pray to / and call vpon god / but in a perpetuall du∣bitaciō whether god be mercifull / forgeue or heare them. For nether thei nor we can be certified by our workis / whether we be for their sakis worthie to be herde and for geuen. Wherfore our faithe stayed vpon god and vpon his promises to be herd & forgeuen for crystis sake whom the father willed to be offred vp a sacrifice for our sinnes / excludeth almaner a doute and al that may let or fight agenst this mercia∣ble forgeuens. For this constant gift of faithe certifieth vs fermely / verely to be receiued of our god and father for his so∣nes sake / and for his sake onely our pray∣ersHeb. 2. & 4. to be herde / as it is writen. We ha∣uinge siche a bishop and mediator / let vsIoan. 15 with bolde confidence go vnto him & cet. And ayen / what soeuer ye aske my father in my name / he will geue it you. For in that he saith in my name / he comandetha prayer vs to aske in the faith and confidence of the mediator. As thus. Oh eternall god & father of our lorde▪ Iesu cryste / the maker and conseruer of althings / most wyse / the este / mercifull / our iuge / and almighty / vpon

But the one eyed great tyraunt kinge CyCy clops ye popes & his pri ces. clops sitting alone in his dēne ladig his bellye with dilicats and his owne flessh with lustes care not for this honeste cure and coniugale loue. He bereth no honeste beneuolence to any parte of mankinde he geueth them not their honeste coniugall honore for their creators sake nor labo∣reth to get his wyfe hir lyuing nor defen deth hir from inconueniences / but him∣self compresseth & dishonesteth al other menis wiues and daughters and turneth vp their halters when he hath done with them / for thei will not be combred wt their owne wyues and childern.

Of this

Who destroieth gods infal lible prouidence and predestinacion but he that decreeth / that a man may preuēt the predestined and apointed howr of his death / infallibly foresene of god? What els is this then to be magnified aboue god?

This sonne of man standinge in whight lynen aboue the waters or flowd / is cryste trea∣dingePersecu∣cion ma∣keth  whight. downe all tribulacions and all the persecucions of his enimies / yea & euen his enemies themselues as sinne dethe deuil and hell makinge of them his foe stole / he is cled in whight for that by his crosse he shuld be made whight and tryed lyke syluer: he telleth Daniel how longe this persecucion shall endure. He telleth him the moste certein token that shall im∣mediatlyThe cer∣tain toke before ye ende. go before the resurreccion / euen the dispersion and scateringe abrode of ye holy peple: which we see it this daye ma∣ny for the wordes sake to be dispersed out of their owne countries and londis as ma ny pore men yet fele it. But how long this dispersion shall endure cryste telleth him not playnly. The zyrik texte sayth vnto ye determined tyme of god / whether it be long or shorte / for somiche signifieth the Hebrewe phrase. Ad tempus tempora &
dimidium. Fewe dayes apere many and a short tyme is longe to the afflicte per∣secuted. And in the endinge of the scate∣ring of the powr of the holy peple shal all these thingis be finisshed. How longe we shalbe thus dispersed by persecucion / one ly god knowth. But of this be we certein that this dispersion by persecucion is the laste and moste certain signe that ye daye of iugement is at hande. For God decla∣red vnto daniel the order of the. 4. monar¦chies / whiche be all paste / and the cruell kingdoms of Anticriste which shuld ary∣se in the fowerth monarchie / whiche at Mahumete and the pope be reueled. And the seculare anticristes which shall ende in the turke / begine faste to growe and to preuaile / which yet shall neuer be lyke in powr to the Romane monarchie / when it was in hir firste flowers. And therfore when the seculare Anticristen kingdoms now begun in the cristen emprowr kings and princes be deuolued into the turkis imperie / thē shal that daye begin to sprin ge / wherin the dead yet a sleape shal awa ke. The sayinge of Elye before in the. 9. lefe of this boke is known of all men / & it ought to be writē in euery manis wall is and wyndows. Cryst telleth vs / the dayes to beshorte∣ned /
as was the course of the yeres vnto Nohe▪ floude shortened that the synnes of the peple might haue bene the sonerThis re keninge agreth wt the. 1290 dayes ta∣ken for wekis in the next lefe folo∣wing. smyten of. And if ye will aftir the playn wordis take the tyme tymes and an half as it stondeth. Then thinke I / that the tyme is taken for ye tyme betwixt or from this reuelacion vnto daniel (which was a non aftir ye ende of the captiuite of Ba∣bylon) & the ende of ye destruccion of the Iewes by Titus / which contayneth. 600 yeres and a lytle more. And the tymes / I take for the long tyme dowbled euen for the twelue hondred yeres sence / wherin hath continewed the persecucion of the chirche of the gentiles sence that destruc cion of Ierusalem / euen for the tyme of ye persecucion by ye Romane emprours and aftirwarde by the Mahumete and ye tur∣ke and the pope and his seculare impes. The half tyme / I take it for. 300. yeres / From ye destruc∣cion of ye temple to this day 1474 which be the half of. 600. Now from the destruccion of Ierusalem vnto this daye ther are. 1474. yeres / so that by this reke∣ninge the half tyme shalbe ended with in these. 30. yeres to come. But this reke∣ning will I not certaynly affirme. But ra ther take the half tyme / for siche a shorte soden tyme as no vngodly man can iuge it / but thinke it rather to be as long ayen /
and so prouyde for it whylis god sodenly kut him of / in the middis of his course / as it is wryten. The blody vngodly deceyt∣fullPsal. 54. shall not come to half the tyme they loked fore. Theis coniectures I permit∣te vnto the iugements of the crysten rea∣ders desyering euery man not to be to cu∣riouse in this accompt / but to repent & be∣leue the gospell / to be redye and awayte for the lord is coming. ☞ I herde it / but I vnderstode it not / Text. wherfore I sayd: Lorde / what / or when is the laste ende of these thinges? And he sayd: Go thy ways daniel / for these wor∣dis are shut vp and sealled vp vnto ye last tyme. Very many in the mean tyme shal∣be purged / and made whight and blowne togyther tryed as metall in the fyer: but ye vngodly shall do wykedly / nether shall all the vngodly vnderstande nor regarde these thingis / but the wyse lerned shall regarde and teache themforth. Here it is shewed to daniel. That the∣se wordes cōcerning the tyme and tymes and an half / or ende of this persecucion / shalbe seald vp and not knowen vntyll ye last tyme & last dayes of the worlde when iniquite shall preuayle and raigne most rankest and rypest / and the vngodly shall not regarde this prophecye / but rather
laugh the techers and declarers therof to skorne as they dyd in the tyme of Nohe The vngodly shall abuse these wordes into thencreace of their owne dampnable destruccion and persecucion of the godly / which by persecucion and skatering abro∣de / in greate heuynes and perels / and at last by greuouse tormentings & deathes / they shalbe tryed as is metall melted wt blowings in the fyer. But the chosen god∣ly teachers shall vnderstande these wor∣des in the later dayes / teache & geue war ning to ye other & therfore shall thei haue the knowlege of ye tyme and of the yeres. And as dyd Nohe an hondred yeres befo∣re preche repentance makinge the arke to saue the good / so shall these good techers an hondred yeres before prechinge repen∣tance buyld vp the arke of the gospell of saluacion by fayth in cryst restored at last (as euen now these certayn yeres past) to saue and preserue the chosen from damp∣nacion. ☞ Furthermore as touchinge the ty∣me,Text. wherin the perpetuall dayly sacrificeLuther last of al began to buylde this arke shalbe taken awaye and from the tyme of the setting vp of the abominable destruc∣cion / there shalbe a thousande / two hon∣dred / &. xc. dayes / Oh blessed man / that shall tarye and see the thousande thre hō∣dred
and fyue and thirtye dayes.26. yere ago. Now cometh the aungel nyerer the en∣de to more specially termes vnto a deter∣mined tyme expressed by dayes. 1290. which make half an heb. 3 yers & an half. In the 8. chap. it was tolde that aftir the takinge awaye of the continuall sacrifice & settinge vp of the abominable idole the signe of destruccion / there shulde be two thousand and. 300. dayes which make. 6. yeres. 3. moniths and. 20. dayes / which is almost an hebdomade of yeres / in yt which half hebdom. which is here in this firste nowmber of. 1290. dayes / the Iewes were greuously skatered persecuted and slayne of Antioch{us} vntyll the greater nowmber was fulfylled / that is. 133. dayes begin∣ning the tother half hebdom. wherin the Machabeis gote ye victorye of Antiochus and restored the dayly sacrifices and tem ple all agen. And therfore he here sayth: Oh blessed is he that shall perseuer & see the. 1335. dayes that is / shall escape that miserable heuey first half hebd. and enter into the later half / that is / into the later ende of the hebdom. But if any man be∣leueth (sayth doctor Draconites) that the aungell here alludeth vnto the seuenteth hebdom. in the. 9. chap. where ended the comonaltie of the Iewes by the Romās /
he must confesse by these. 1290. dayes to be vnderstanden the half hebdom. that is / the. 3. yeres and. 3. monethis / in the which tyme / by the emprour Caligula the idoll was setvp in ye temple / & the dayly wont sacrifice was taken awaye by the apostles Act. 15. & the Iewes comonaltie vtterly destroyd. For aftirward ye sowne of the go spell went ouer all ye world. Blessed ther∣fore were they which came to that daye. But let vs come to these present dayes / wherin we see and feele miche & greuou∣se persecucions / and behold how greuou∣se and bitter it is for. 3. 02. 4. yeares conti∣nually / & then aftir / how god remitteth it for as long a ceason agen to geue vs a pla∣ce for a lytle ceason to rest vs / euen as it were the halcyn dayes to suffer his chir che to breathe a whyle: that she maye be the stronger ayenst the next storme & ba∣taill folowinge. But turne these. 1290. dayes into we∣kis / which make. 24. yeris and. 24. wkis & then is it iuste that aftir caligula had done that blaphemie / the iewes amon af∣tir. 24. yeris were destroid by titus & im∣mediately begane thei to destroie them∣selues by mutuall ciuile sedicions. The continuall dayly sacrifice and the abomi nacion of the desolacion standinge vp so
longe in our hichs / r their misses / Mayzim / popisshrites tradicions of mē supersticiose ceremo and images. When the gospell now of late begane to be resto red by the lerned menis writings and pre chinges and so to take awaye these sayd abominacions / then their folowed this great skatringe and persecucion of the faithfull whiche yet endureth. In which wold god these. 1290. dayes were turned but into so many wkis whiche make. 24. yeris and. 24. wekis / that blessed mought theibe whiche shall seethe. 1335. daies  make. 2. yeris &. 35 wekis which agreeth with the said rekening of the tyme tymes and the halfe tyme. And if ye turne the dayes into monethes / so itagreth with ye 100. yeris wherin the arke of oh was in making before the floude. So that ethe with in these. 30. yeres 02. 100. yeres to co∣me there shalbe meruelouse mutacions in this worlde or as I coniecture an ende therof. There is one man that taketh the tyme for an hebdomade of yeris that  for 7. yeris & the tymes for two hebdo. that is 14. yeris / & the half tyme for half an heb. that is 3. yeris & an half: wt make. 24. ye∣ris & an half / & he begineth at the yete of the lorde. 1544. to reken. But I iuge that it is not geuē to any at
this tyme to know this misterye concer∣ninge the very daye and hower hyden in the nowmber / tyll it be fulfilled. And ther fore I do but coniecture and dre not af∣firme it for certain. As beit I knowe that God wolde haue hys chosen to be mo∣nisshed before of the tyme and yeres by this prediccion. And therfore let vs pray vnto god to gouerne & preserue his chir∣che & shortely to ut of this sinful course of humane nature. Beware of images Bware of ima∣ges & of mayzim. of ayzim / which is not yet euery where throne downe / but onely in certain places of the ouer germany / where the gospel is purely preched & receyued of men taught of god. For aftir his fall there shal begin greter trouble emong the godly by the an ticristes / ether for the restornge of it / o∣rels for the bringinge in (I feare me) of ye Mahumets lawe and the turkis religi∣on. But these troublous laste dayes shall not longe dure. For god wilbe as merci∣full to vs / as he was to the iewes in An∣tiochus tyme / not sufferinge that greuou sepersccucion to continewe senger thenBe knit it not vp in few ye ris but i many da yes. ye said. 1290. dayes / he saith dayes becau∣se the litle tyme apereth so longe to the afflicted. Th{us} be we warned to perseuer strongly in pacience abydinge the glori∣ous coming of cryste to iugement / to slaye
this anticristen horned whore of babylon withe the almighty breathe of his mouth that we might haue our perpetuall ioye & teste with cryste. But (daniel go thou hence vntyll the ende be comen & be at reste. For thouText. shalt stand vp with thy parte in the ende of the tymes. Here at last is daniel commanded of ye aungell Cryst to departe and to take his reste / his bodye to lye down and sleape in the duste / & his soule to reste in ioye in A∣brahams bosome / which is in heuen with god the father with his sone & holy gost / & with all ye holy aungels & spirits of the lust / vntyll that gloriouse daye of ye resur¦reccion / all crystis enimies thrust downe vnder his fete.
