coat of arms of the City of London By the Major. THe Right Honourable the Lord Major having taken into his serious Consideration the many dreadful Afflictions, which this City hath of late years suffered, by a raging Plague, a most un∣heard of devouring Fire, and otherwise: And justly fearing that the same have been occasioned by the many hainous crying Sins and Provocations to the Divine Majesty: And his Lordship also considering the present dangers of greater mischiefs and misery which seem still to threat∣en this City, if the execution of the Righteous Iudgments of God Almighty be not prevented by an universal timely Repentance and Reformation: He hath therefore thought it one duty of his Office, being intrusted to take all possible care for the good Government, Peace, and Wel∣fare of this City, First, to pray and perswade all and every the Inhabitants thereof to reform in themselves and Families all Sins and Enormities whereof they know themselves to be guilty: And if neither the Fear of the Great God nor of his Impending Iudgments shall prevail upon them; He shall be obliged to let them know, that as he is their Chief Magistrate, he ought not to bear the Sword in vain: And therefore doth resolve by Gods Grace to take the Assistance of his Brethren the Aldermen, and to require the aid of all the Officers of this City in their several places, to Punish and Suppress according to the Laws of the Land and the good Customs of this City, those Scandalous and Provoking Sins which have of late encreased and abounded amongst Vs, even without shame, to the dishonour of Christianity and the Scandal of the Government of this City, heretofore so famous over the World, for its Piety, Sobriety, and good Order. To the end therefore that the Laws may become a Terror unto Ebil doers, and that such, in whose hearts the fear of God, and the love of Virtue shall not prevail, (being fore-warned) may amend their Lives for fear of punishment; His Lordship hath thought fit to remember them of several Penalties provided by Law against notorious Offenders: As also all Constables and Publick Officers (who are to put the said Laws in Execution) of their Duty therein;
First, Every Profane Curser and Swearer ought to be Punished by the payment of Twelve Pence for every Oath, and if the same cannot be Levied upon the Offenders Goods, then he is to sit Three Hours in the Stocks. Secondly, Every Drunkard is to pay for the first Offence Five Shillings: And in default thereof to sit Six Hours in the Stocks, and for the second Offence, to find Sureties for the good behaviour, or to be Committed to the Common Goal: And the like Punishment is to be in flicted upon all Common Haunters of Ale-houses and Taverns, and Com∣mon Gamesters, and Persons justly suspected to live by any unlawful means, having no visible way to support them∣selves in their manner of living. And no Person is to sit or continue Tipling or Drinking more than one Hour, un∣less upon some Extraordinary Occasion, in any Tavern, Victualling-house, Ale-house, or other Tipling-house, up∣on the penalty of Ten Shillings for every Offence upon the Master of such House, and upon the Person that shall so continue drinking, Three Shillings Four Pence. Thirdly, Every Person maintaining Houses suspected of Common Bawdry, by the Law is to find Sureties for the good behaviour; likewise all Night-Walkers and Persons using that impudent and insufferable practice of attempting others modesty in the Streets, are to be punished at the House of Correction and find Sureties for the good behaviour. Fourthly, All Persons using any unlawful Exercises on the Lords Day, or Tipling in Taverns, Inns or Ale-houses, and Coffee-houses, during Divine Service on that day, are to forfeit Three Shillings Four Pence, for every Of∣fence, to be Levied by distress, and where none can be had, to sit three hours in the Stocks: And every Vintner, Inn-keeper or Ale-house keeper, that shall suffer any such Drinking or Tipling in his House, is to forfeit Ten Shillings, for every Offence: And no Person may sit in the Streets, with Herbs, Fruits, or other things, to expose them to Sale, nor no Hackney Coachman may stand or ply in the Streets on that day. And therefore all Constables and other Officers, whom it doth or may concern, are required, according to their Oaths solemnly taken in that behalf, to take care for discovering and bringing to Punishment whosoever shall Of∣fend in any of the Premises: And for that end they are to enter into any suspected Houses before mentioned, to search for any such disorderly Persons as shall he found misbehaving themselves, or doing contrary to the said Laws, and to Levy the Penalties, and bring the Offenders before some of his Majesties Iustices of the Peace of this City, to be dealt withall according to Law. And whereas there are other disorders of another nature, very Dishonourable and a great Scandal to the Govern∣ment of this City, and very prejudicial to the Trade and Commerce of the same: His Lordship therefore is resolved by Gods Blessing with the Assistance of his Brethren the Aldermen, to use his utmost endeavour to prevent the same, by putting in Execution the good and wholsome Laws in force for that purpose, with all Strictness and severity; Some of which he hath thought fit to enumerate with the Duties and Penalties upon every Constable and other Of∣ficers concerned therein. As First, the great resort of Rogues, Vagrants, Idle Persons, and Common Beggars, Pestring and Anoying the Streets and Common Passages, and all places of Yublick Meetings and resort, against whom very good provision is made by the Law, viz. That all such Persons shall be openly Whipped, and forthwith sent from Parish to Parish, to the place where He or She was born, if known; if not, to the place where He or She last dwelt for the space of one Year, to be set to work; or not being known where He or She was born or dwelt, then to be sent to the Parish where He or She last passed through without punishment. That every Constable that shall not do his best Endeavour for the Apprehension of such Vagabond, Rogue, or
Sturdy Beggar, and cause Him or Her to be punished or conveyed according to Law, shall forfeit Ten Shillings for eve∣ry default. Secondly, The not Paving and Cleansing of the Streets: The redressing whereof being by a late Act of Parlia∣ment put into Commissioners appointed by Common Council His Lordship doth hereby recommend the same to the Deputies and Common Council of the several Wards within this City, to use their utmost diligence in that affair, and especially to mind their respective Commissioners of the Duty incumbent upon them, and of the daily Damage which the City suffers by the neglect thereof. And his Lordship doth declare he will appear at the said Commission of Sewers as often as his more Vrgent Occasions will give him leave, and doth expect such Attendance of the other Com∣missioners as may render the Act more effectual than hitherto it hath been. Thirdly, The neglect of the Inhabitants of this City, in hanging and keeping out their Lights at the accustomed hours, according to the good and Antient usage of this City, and Acts of Common Council in that behalf. Fourthly, The not setting and continuing the Watches at such hours, and in such Numbers, and in such sober and orderly manner in all other respects; as by the Acts of Common Council in that behalf is directed and appointed. And his Lordship doth strictly require the Fellowship of Carmen, to be very careful in the due observance of the good and wholsome Rules, and Orders, which have been made for their regulation: His Lordship intending severely to inflict the Penalties imposed in default thereof. And to the end that no Constable or other Officers or Ministers of Iustice may be any ways discouraged in their Lawful Diligent and Vigorous Prosecution of the Premises: It is provided, That if they or any of them shall be re∣sisted, in the just and lawful Execution of their Charge and Duty, or in any wise Affronted or Abused, they shall be encouraged, maintained, and vindicated by the Iustice, order, and Authority of his Lordship and the Court of Alder∣men; and the Offenders Prosecuted and Punished according to Law. Dated at the Guild-hall London, the 29th. day of November 1679 in the 31 year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord CHARLES the Second, by the grace of God of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c. God save the King. Printed by Samuel Roycroft, at his House in St. Bartholomew Close; Printer to the Honourable City of LONDON, 1679.
