Courant out of Italy, Germany, &c. From Roome the 6. of March, 1621. ON Sunday last / the Pope is gone to Vati∣cano in the Chappels / being accompanied with all the Ambassadours / Prelates and other Nobles there present. It is understood from Naples that there are 3000 men taken on / to be used upon the Catho∣like Army. From Venize the 12. hereof. Newes from Thurino mentioneth that in Piemont are put 2000 horsemen and 6000 foote men / whereby it is thought that the Duke of Savoy hath som speciall matters in hand / it is also understood from Schweits / that the Frēch Ambassadour is very ill content concerning the Capitulatie / which the Liga Grisa had made with the Governour of Milan / to the great hin∣drance of his King and the Graubaunderen. Advise from Constantinopel mentioneth that the setting forwards of the Great Turke was published / and that in the ende of Februarij last past the whole Armey of three hundred thousand men should come together at Adrianopel: And that the Cosackes gathered together with a very greate Power to march against the Turkes. From Vienna the 17. of Martij. The Ambassadour of Polen would leuy 20. thousand mē in Germanie / whereunto the Em∣perour hath consented / but they will be hardly raysed / never the lesse the Earle of Altheim hath given many Comissions out already. The Co∣sackes last mentioned / which could not get through to goe homewards / because of the Hun∣garians / have lost above 1000. horses by Scali∣hits and all there bootie is taken from them / so that the rest of them retired this wayes againe. The handeling of Peace at Haimburg conti∣nueth yet / and there is another Prolongation made until the 25. of this moneth. The Bu∣diani and other Hungarian Lords do seeke for mercy at the Emperours hands / and weare gladly set free from Betlem Gabor / and they long much to see the Emperours Armey to fall into Hungarie / whereby they might the more conveniently put themselves under the Empe∣rour. The 12 hereof hath Betlem beset the Cittie of Presburg and the Castle with 6000 Hunga∣rians / likewise planted many Turkes and Tar∣tarians on the other side of the Donaw. The sayd Betlem hath done an attempt upon The∣ben / but to no effect / he hath in like manner gi∣ven order to fortifie the Hungarian Altenburg and Presburg. Although Bethlem Gabors Chaunsellor is gone to Thyrna with secret resolutions to have them ratifyed / yet it seemes that Bethlem Ga∣bor doth feare that his Chanssellor might goe in any danger to Haimburg / so long as the French Ambassadour doth not assure that he shall com to Presburg againe without danger. At Haimburg is a Spie from Savoy / and he is taken and imprisoned / who killed himselfe there / the next day a Hungarian was taken / who was determined to doe greate matters against the Emperour the Cittie of Vienna and the Earle of Bucquoy / it seemes the Emperour is minded to goe from hence to Graets / where he meanes to Create / and, make the old Prince Governour there. From Prage the 16. hereof. The last Fryday some certaine peeces of Or∣denaunce weare caried from hence into the Saltzer raits / towards Ellenbogen / which shall be imployed against the Earle of Mans∣velt / who mustere 2. Regiments by Nieustattel and there resorted to him dayly many Folke / there with he hath som speciall Enterprise in hand. On Sonday last arrived heere the Deputies or Lords Commissioners from Vienna / and they first take in hand the cause / concerning the arrested persons / so that it is to be feared that it will cost som there heads heere and at Vienna. Yesterday is brought hither the Lord of Har∣ranck / the which hath beene the Chamber Pre∣sident of the Bohemians in those rumors / and put in strong imprisonment. From Breslaw the 11. of March. Our Commissioners are arived heere yester∣day from Dresden with good contentment / na∣mely that the Duke Elector of Saxens dealing with the Emper. Maj. and these Lands stoode upon a good peace / and that at this present it stands but upon the ratification of both sides / though Betlem Gabor threatens / that if they doe fall from the Conferation / hee will plague them with fire and sword / never the lesse it is hooped that the Souldiors shall be casseerd of both sides / by reason the Poole is to be feared / who is much threatened of the Turke / like as advise comes / that the Turkes have roved with in 6. leagues of Cracou / pilladging and burning all away / and taken many thousand people pri∣soners. It stands also very badly with Moravia / for heere is com certaine newes / that Betlem Ga∣bor hath sent 20 thousand Hungarians / Turks and Tarters over the Wittenberg / and many thousands follow / who spare no man with stea∣ling and burning all away. From Lemburg in Silesia the 18. hereof. Heere it is said that the Marcgrave of Ia∣gersdorp is marched with 7000. men to the
news: where the Moravish? Camp under the Earle of Turne shall meet him / so is likewise said that the Earle of Mansvelt hath slaine upon the Fronters of Bohemiae 1000. of the Duke of Saxens Folk. From Lints the 18. hereof. It is now wholy decreed / that the States of this Land shall pay every moneth those that lay in Garrisson 34000. Florins of the which every hearth place in the Countrey shall pay 24 Creyrser / and in the Townes 29 Creytser every moneth. From the Palati: the 19. hereof. The Marckgrave of. Ansbach and Duke of Wirtenberg are in hand with the Landgrave of Darmstadt / like as they 2. dayes since we are all together at Wicheym / and for this present at Heydelverg / God give that som good may be effected. This dan hath Spinola laid his Shipbridge againe over the Rijne at Oppenheym. The Letters of Dansick mention / that the Turkish Emperour hath sent this fearefull let∣ter heare following: A disdaynfull Letter, vvritten by the Tur∣kish Emperour to the King of Polen. Wee Mahomet Suldan / Illustruous and Vnconquerable Emperour and Angel of God / Turkish Emperour / Macedonian and Babi∣lonian King / in great and small Egipt / Ruler of whole Christendom and Europe / King in Alex∣andrja and Iuda / in like manner of Portugall / and over all the Potentates upon the Earth / al∣so a Lord of Lordes over all Lordes / keeper of the Heathens Parradijs / and the Holy Graves / as well of the great Prophet Mahomet at Me∣cha / as the worthie Prophet at Ierusalem / King of all Kinges / Lord of all Lordes / Prince of all Princes / Lord of all Gods upon the Earth / Lord of the Trce of lyff / of all Townes and Castles / Lord of the great and small Sea / Lord of all Hauens and Ryvers / Lord of all Streames on the whole World / the great Go∣vernour above all Governours of Townes. Doe send unto thee King of Poland our Em∣perourlike greetinge / for that thou with thy little King in thy secret Councell for thy owne partilar profit dost take in hand / to stryve a∣gainst our Illustrius person / and most powre∣full King / and wee doe wonder that thow dost not feare our great might / and thy owne death with thy little King / considdering that thou in former time didst seeke peace with us / and ther upon sent thy Ambassadors often / whome did assure us thy desire of quyetnes / and that thow wouldst not have any ill thought to doe any thing to the contrarye / and yet thow hast taken upon thee not onely in our Government / but also in Mnscou to fall upon our Vassalls / and determined with thy selfe utterly to spoyle thē: Like as many places are destroyed / taken in / and spoyled. So that thow shalt know / doe what thow canst / wee wilbe revenged one thee and thy little Kings with whome thou hast cō∣quered the same / and meanest to set them in Governement / And not only be revendged / but pursew thee to the uttermost / to blot out the re∣membrance of thy name / and because thou shalt know what more revenge thou hast urged us to / is onely by reason / that thou hast broken the Leagne betwixt us / disdayned and abused the same / and therefore assure thy self with thy litle Kings to be brought before us / and thou shalt see with what power from all the places of the World that shall come to me / how I will over∣run thee / and use thee with thy prysoners so cruelly as may be / therefore henceforwardes thou needest not to hope of any mercy at our hands / and that wee are not a frayd of thy strong places / or for thy strong Walles at Cra∣cou / for wee will not only fall upon that towne and likewise thy court / but also thy Camp and whole Land / and so spoyleand ruinate them / that not one stoue shall remayne upod another / also root out the remembrance of thee and thy Kingdome. In witnes or taken hereof wee send thee hear with our blodye Sable / for that it shall speedly be followed by as / and then wee will so cover thy Land with horse troopes / foot Companies and Cammels / that like in many yeares hath not been seene. Only that Gods wrach thorow us / may be layd upon thee / for God is an up∣holder of the good / and a punisher of evell and peacebrekers / ād like as wee are unto the a God upon Earth / so wee doe shake out our rod and anger against thee / onely to punish thy false breaking of Truce. Let now thy Gods come to help thee / if they will / neverthelesse it shall not helpe thee / thy Holyons wee will assuredly put to the Plough / and so make them to plough the voyde Lands of Bulgaria and Iudea / where they shallbe so planted / that none shall returne backe againe / and therefore conteut thy self heare with our meaning as aforesayd. All this wee have thought good to let thee know our displeasure / from Constantinople / in the yeare of our Rayne / etc. His Majestie of Denmarke causeth many Souldiors dayly to be raysed. In like manner doth the King of Sweden. Imprinted at Amsterdam by George Veseler, Ao. 1621. The 9 of April.
