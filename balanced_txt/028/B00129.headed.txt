Iohan Frith vnto the Christen Reader. 1. Pet. 1. 2. Tim. 3BLessed be god the father of ou∣re lorde Iesus christe / which in these last and parylous tymes hath sturred vpp in all contres wittnesses vn to his sonne to testifye the truth vn to the vn∣faithfull / to saue at the least so me from ye snares of Antichrist which leade vn to perdicyon.1. Cor. 9. As ye maye here perceyve by that excellent and well lerned youn¦ge man Patrike borne in scotlande of a noble progenye / which to testifye the truth sought all meanes and toke vppon him preesthod (euen as Paule circumcysed timothe to wynne the wea∣ke Iewes) that he might be admitted to preach the pure worde of god.Actes. xvi Notwithstondinge asso∣ne as the chamberlayne and other bisshopes of scotlande had perceyved that the light beganne to sprynge whych disclosed their falshed that they convey in darkenesse / thy layed handes on him: and because he wolde not denye his savi∣oure christ at their instance they burnte him to ashes. Neverthelesse god of his bounteous mer¦rye (to pubish vn to the hole worlde / what a mā the monsters haue murthered / hath reserved a litle treatise made by this patrike / which if ye li∣ste ye maye calle Patrikes places. For it entrea¦teth exactelye of certeyne comen places / which knowne / ye haue the pith of all diuinite. This treatise haue I turned in to the english tongue to the profite of my nacyon: to whom I be¦sech god geue light / that they maye espye the deceytefull pathes of perdi∣cyon & retourne in to the right waye which leadeth vn to li¦fe everlastinge.

Patrikes Places ¶ Of the lawe. THe lawe is a doctrine that biddeth good & forbiddeth evell as his cōmaundementes specifye. ¶ The ten commaundementes 1 Thou salt worshuppe but one god. 2. Thou shalt make y• none image to worshuppe i 3. Thou shalt not swere by his name in vayne. 4 Holde the sabboth daye holye. 5 Honoure thy father and thy mother.Er. 20. Mat 22. 6 Thou shalt not kille 7. Thou shalt not committe advoutry. 8 Thou shalt not steale. 9 Thou shalt beare no false witnesse. 10 Thou shalt not desyre ought that belongeth to thy neyghboure ¶ He that loveth god and his neyghboure kepeth all the commaundementes of god Love thy lorde god with all thyne harte / with all thy soule and with all thy mynde.Maior. Deu. 6 Mat. 22 This is ye first and greate commaundement: The seconde is like vn to this: that is / love thy neyghboure as thy silfe. In these two commaundementes hange all the lawe and the prophetes. ¶ He that loueth god / loueth his neyghboure.Minor. 1. Joa. 4 If a man saye / I loue god / and yet hateth his brother / he is a lyar. He that loveth not his brother whom he hath sene / how can he love god whō he hath not sene ¶ He that loueth his neyghboure as him selfe kepeth all the commaundementes of godCōclusion Vvhat so ever ye wolde that men shulde do to you / even so do to them.Mat. 7. For this is the lawe & the prophetes.Rom. 13. He that loveth his neyghboure / fulfilleth the lawe. Thou shalt not committe advoutrye. Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steale. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse.
Thou shalt not desire / and so forth if there be any other commaundement / are all comprehen∣ded in this sainge: loue thy neyghboure as thy silfe.Gala. 5 All the lawe is fulfilled in one worde / yt is / love thy neyghboure as thy selfe. ¶ He yt loveth god kepeth al ye cōmaundmētes He that loveth his neighboure kepeth all ye cō∣maundementes of god Ro. xiij. Gala. v. & he yt loveth god loveth his neyghboure.Maior 1. Ioan. iiij. ergo he yt loueth god kepith all his commaunde mentes.Minor. ¶ He that hath the faith loueth god My father loveth you / because ye loue me and beleve that I come of god.Ioan. 16 ¶ He that hath the faith kepeth all the commaundementes of godConclusio He that hath the fayth / loveth god / ād he that loveth god kepeth all his commaundementes: ergo he that hath the faith kepeth all the com∣maundementes of god ¶ He that kepeth one commaundement of god kepeth them all. For with out faith it is impossible to kepe any of the commaundemētes of god / and he yt hath the faith kepeth all the commaundementes of god:Hebre. 11. ergo he that kepeth one commaundement of god kepeth them all. ¶ He that kepeth not all the commaunde mentes of god kepeth not one of thē. He that kepeth one commaundement of god / he kepeth all / ergo he that kepeth not all the cō∣maun dementes of god kepeth not one of them ¶ It is not in oure power to kepe anye of the commaundementes of god Vvith out grace / it is impossible to kepe anye of the commaundementes of god / & grace is not in oure power: ergo it is not in oure power to
kepe anye of the commaundemētes of god. evē so maye you reason concerninge the holye gost and fayth. The lawe was geuē to shew vs oure sinne By the lawe cometh the knowlege of synne I knew not what sinne mēt but thorow ye lawe I had not knowne what lust had mēt / excepte the lawe had saide thou shalt not lust.Roma. 3. Roma. 7. with out ye lawe sinne was deed / yt is it moued me not / neither wist I yt it was sinne / which not withstōdinge was sinne & forbobedē by ye lawe. The lawe biddth vs do that thinge wh¦ych is impossible for vs. For it biddeth vs kepe the cōmaundemētes of god / & yet is it not in our power to kepe anye off thē / ergo it biddeth vs do that is impossible for vs. Thou wilt saye where to doeth god bid vs do that is impossible for vs? I answere / to make the knowe that thou art but euell / and that the∣re is no remedye to saue the in thine awne han¦de / & yt thou mayst seke remedie at summe other for the lawe doeth nought but commaunde the.

Or any such as declare vn to vs the mercye of godA The nature of the lawe and the gospell. The lawe sheweth vs oure sinne The gospel shweth vs remedie for it The lawe sheweth vs oure condempnacyon The gospell sheweth vs oure redempcion The lawe is the worde of Ire The gospell is the worde of grace The lawe is the worde of despayre The gospell is the worde of comforte The lawe is the worde of vnrest The gospell is the worde of peace A dysputacyon betwene the lawe and the gospll The lawe sayeth / paye thy dette The gospell sayeth Christ hath payed it The lawe sayeth thou are a synner / despayre and thou shalt be damned.
The gospell saieth / thy sinnes are forgeuen the be of good comforte thou shalt be saued. The lawe sayeth / make a mendes for thy sinne The gospel saieth / Christ hath made it for the. The lawe saieth / the father of heavē is wrath with the. The gospel saieth / Christ hath pace fyed hym wyth his bloude. The lawe saieth where is thi right wisenesse / goodnesse & satisfac¦cyon? The gospell sayeth / Christ is thy right wysenesse thy goodnesse and satisfaccyon. The lawe saieth thou arte bounde and obliged to me / to the devyll and to hell. The gospel saieth / Christ hath deliuered the frō them all. ¶ Of fayth. FAith is to beleue god: like as Abrahā bele∣ued god and it was imputed vn to him for rygutwylenesse.Gene. 15. ¶ He that beleueth god / beleueth his worde. To veleue one is to beleue his worde and to re¦counte it true that he sayeth. ¶ He yt beleueth not goodes word / beleueth not god hym selfe. He that beleueth not goddes worde he coūteth hym false & a lyare / ād beleueth not yt he maye and will fullfyll his worde:1. Ioan. 5. and so he denyeth both the might of god ād god him selfe. ¶ Fayth is the gyfte of god▪ Euerye good thinge is the gifte of god / fayeth is good ergo faith is the gifte of god.Iaco. 1. ¶ Faith is not in oure power The gifte of god is not in oure power / faith ys the girte of god ergo faith is not in oure power ¶ with out faith it is impossible to pleace god All that cometh not of faith is sinne / for with out faith cā no man pleace god.Ro. 14. Heb. 11. Besides that he
that lacketh faith / he trusteth not god / he that trusteth not god trusteth not his worde / he that trusteth not his worde holdeth hun false and a lyar / he that holdeth hym false and a lyar he be∣leveth not that he maye do that he promiseth / and so denieth he that he is god. And how can a man beinge of this facyon pleace hym? No ma∣ner of waye / yee suppose he did al y dedes that euer dyd man or angell. All that is done in faith pleaseth God Bight is the worde of god ād all his workes in faith. Lorde thine yien loke to faith / yt is as mo¦ch to saie as lorde thou delightest in faith. God loveth him that beleueth in hym / how can they then displeace hym He that hath the faith is iust and good / and a good tre bereth good frute: ergo all that is done in fayth pleaseth god. Morouer / he that hath the faith beleueth god: he that beleueth god / beleueth his worde: he yt beleueth hys worde / woteth well that he is true and faithfull and maye not lye. But knoweth yt he both maye ād will fulfill his worde / how can he thē displease him? for thou canst not do anye greater honoure to god / thē to counte him true. Thou wilt then saye that thefte / murther / ad∣voutrye and all vices pleace god. Naye verelye for they can not be done in faith: for a good tre bereth good frute. He that hath the faith wotteth well that he pleaseth god▪ For all that is done in faith pleaseth god Fayth is a surenesse. Fayth is a sure confidence of thynges whych are hoped for / and a certentye of thinges which are not sene.Hebre. 11.
The same sprete certeneth oute sprete that we are the children of god More ouer he that hath the faith wotteth well that god wyll fulfyll hys worde:Roms. 8. ergo fayth ys a surenesse. A man is iustified by fayth Abraham beleued god ād it was unputed vn∣to him for rightwysenes.Gene. 15. Vve supposse therore that a man ys iustifyed by fayth with out the dedes of the lawe He that worketh not but beleveth on hym that iustifyeth the vngodlye / hys fayth is counted to hym for rightwylenesse.Roma. 3. Roma. 4. The iust mā liueth by his faith.Abacuc. 2. Gala. 2. Abacuc. 2. Ro. 1 Vve wotre that a man ys not iustifyed by the dedes of the lawe / but by the fayth of Iesu chri∣ste. And we beleue in Iesu christe / that we maye be iustifyed by the fayth of christ and not by the dedes of the lawe. Of the fayth of christ The fayth of christ / is to beleue in him / that ys to beleue his worde and to beleve that he wyll helpe the in all thy nede and delyuer the from al euell. thou wylt aske me what worde? I answe∣re / the gospell. He that beleueth in Christ shall be saued He that beleueth the sonne hath euerlastinge li¦fe.Ioan. 3. Ioan. 6. verelye / verelye I saye vn to you / he that be leueth in me hath eueriastinge life. This I write vn to you that beleue on the na∣me of the sonne of god that ye maie know how that ye haue eternall life1. Ioan. 5. Thomas because thou hast sene me / therfore hast thou beleued,Ioan. 20. happie are they yt haue not se∣ne / and yet haue beleued in me. Al ye prophetes to him beare witnesse / yt who soActes. 10

If thou knowledge with thy mouth that Iesus is the lorde.Roma. 10 And beleue with thyne harte yt god raysed him vp frō deeth thou shalt be sate. He yt beleueth not in christ shalbe cōdēpned He that beleueth not shalbe dampned He that beleueth not the sonne shall neuer se ye life but the ire of god bideth vppon hym.Marc. 16. Idan. 3. The hoye gost shall reproue the worlde of syn∣ne / because they beleue not in me They that beleue in Iesu christ are the son¦nes of god. ye are al the sonnes of god because ye beleue in Iesu christ.Gala. 3. He yt beleueth yt christ is ye sōn of god is safe Peter saied / thou arte christ ye sonne of ye lyuin¦ge god.Mat. 16. Ies{us} answered & saied vnto him happye art thou Simō ye sōne of Ionas for flesh & blou¦de haue not opened to the that / but my father that is in heaven. Vve haue beleued and knowe that thou arte Christ the sonne of the lyuynge god.Ioan. 6. I beleue that thou arte Christ the sonne of god which shulde come in to the worlde These thīges are writē yt ye might beleue yt Ie¦sus is christ ye sonne of god / ād yt ye in beleuyn∣ge might haue life I beleue that Iesus is the sonne of god.Actes. 8. He yt beleueth god. beleueth the gospell. He yt beleueth god beleueth his worde & ye gos∣pell is his worde / therfore he yt beleueth god be∣leueth ye gospel. As / christ is ye sauiour of ye wo∣rlde. Christ is oute sauioure.Ioan. 4. Christ bought vs with his bloude.
Christ wish vs with his bloude.Apo. 1. Heb. 7.8. 1. Pet. 2. Christ. offered him selfe for vs. Christ bare oure sinnes on his awne backe. &c. ¶ He that beleueth not the gospell beleveth not god. He yt beleveth not goddes worde / beleveth not him selfe / & the gospell is gods worde / ergo he yt beleueth not the gospell beleueth not God him selfe / & consequentlye they that beleue not the aboue writen and such other / beleve not god. He yt beleveth the gospell shall be saffe. Goo ye in to all the worlde and preach the gos∣pell vnto euery creature / he that beleveth & is baptised shalbe saved but he that beleueth not shalbe condempnedMarc. 16 A comparison betwene faith and vnfaith fulnesse or incredulyte. Faith is the roote of all good Incredulite is the roote of all evell Faith maketh god and man good frendes Incredulite maketh them foes. Faith bringeth god and man together Incredulite sundereth them. All yt fayth doth pleaseth god. Faith onlye maketh a mā good and rightwise. Incredulite onlye maketh him in iust and evell. Faith maketh a man a membre of Christ Incredulite maketh him a membre of the deuell Faith maketh a man the enheritoure of heauē. Incredulite maketh him enheritoure of hell Faith maketh a man the seruaunte of god. Incredulite maketh him y• seruaūte of y• deuell Faith sheweth vs god to be a swete father Incredulite sheweth him a terrible iudge. Faith holdeth stiffe by the words of god
Incredulite Wauereth here and there Faith counteth and holdeth god to be true. Incredulite holdeth him false and a lyar Faith knoweth god. Incredulite knoweth him not Faith loveth both god and hir neyghboure Incredulite loueth neyther nother Faith onlye saueth vs Incredulite onlye condempneth vs Faith extolleth god and his deades. Incredulite extolleth her selfe & her awne dedes Of hope HOpe is a trustye lokinge after the thinge yt is promised vs to come: as we hope after euerlastinge ioye which christ hath promised vn¦to all that beleue in him. We shulde put oure hope and trust in god alonlye and in no nother thinge It is good to trust in god and not in man He that trusteth in his awne harte is a fole It is good to trust in god and not in princes They shalbe like vnto the images they make & all that trust in them He that trusteth in his awne thoughtes doth vngodlie Cursed be he that trusteth in mā.Psal. 117. Psal. 113 Bid the rich mē of this worlde yt they trust not ī their vnsta¦ble riches / but yt they trust in the lyvinge god.Pro. 11. Hie. 17 It is harde for them that trust in monye to en∣tre in to the kingdome of heaven Moreouer we shulde trust in him onlye yt ma∣ye helpe vs god onlye maye helpe vs / ergo we shulde trust in him onlye.Mar. 10 well is them that trust in god and wo is them that trust not in him wel is the man that trusteth in god for god shal¦be his trustHier. 17
He y• trusteth in him shall vnderstonde y• verite They shall all reioyce y• trust in the / they shall ever be glade and thou wilt defende them.Sapi. 3. Psal. 5 Of cherite. CHerite is the loue of thy neyghboure. The rule of cherite is this. Doo as thou woldest be done to. For cherite holdeth all a like the rich and the poore / the fren¦de and the foo / the thankefull and vnthankeful the kinseman and straunger. A comparion betwene faith / hope & cherite. Faith cometh of ye worde of god / hope cometh of faith / and cherite springeth of them both. Faith beleueth ye worde / hope trusteth after it yt is promised by the word / cherite doth good vn¦to her neyghboure thorow the loue that it hath to god & gladnes that is with in her selfe. Faith loketh to god & his worde / hope loketh vn to his gifte & rewarde / cherite loketh on her ney¦ghboures profitte. Faith receavth god / hope receaveth his rewarde / Cherite loueth her ney∣ghboure with a glad harte / & yt with out anye respecte of rewarde. Faith pertayneth to god onlye / hope to his rewarde / & cherite to her ney∣ghboure. Of workes NO maner of workes make vs rightwyse we beleue yt a man shall be iustefyed wyth out workes.Gala. 2. No mā is iustefyed by the dedes of the lawe / but by the faith of Iesu Christ / and we beleue in Iesu christ yt we maye be iustefyed by the faith of christ & not by the dedes of ye law. If rightwisenes came by ye lawe thē died christ in vayne.Gala. 2. Gala. 3. That no man is iustefyed by the la∣we it is manifest / for a rightwyse mā lyveth by his faith / but the lawe is not of faith. Moreouer / sith christ the maker of heavyn and
erth & all y• is therin / behoved to dye for vs / we are cōpelled to graunt yt we were so farre drou¦ned & sunkē in sinne yt neyther oure dedes nor all the treasures yt ever god made or might ma∣ke / might haue holpe vs out of them / ergo no de¦des nor workes maye make vs rightwyse. No workes make vs vnrightwyse. For if anye workes made vs vnryghtwyse / then the cōtrarye workes shulde make vs right¦wyse. But it is proved yt no workes can make vs rightwyse / ergo no workes make vs vnrigh¦wise. ¶ workes make vs neyther good nor evel It is {pro}ued yt no workes neyther make vs righ¦twyse nor vnrightwyse / ergo no workes make vs neyther good nor evel For rightwyse & good ar one thinge & vnrightwyse & evel likewise one God workes make not a good mā nor evell workes an evell mā / but a good mā maketh god workes & an evell man evell workes. Good frute maketh not the tre good / nor evell frute the evell tre / but a good tre bereth good frute & an evell tre evell frute.Mat. 7. A good mā can not doo evell workes nor an evel mā good wor∣kes / for a good tre cā not bere evell frute nor an evell tre good frute. A mā is good ere he do good workes / & evell ere he doo evel workes / for the tre is good ere it bere good frute & evel ere it bere evel frute ¶ Euerye mā is eyther good or evel. Everye tre is eyther good or evel / eyther make ye the tre good & ye frute good also / or els make the tre evel & the frute of it likewise evel.Mat. 12 Euerye mānes workes are eyther good or evell For all frute trees are eyther good or evel.Mat. 12 Ey¦ther make ye ye tre good & the frute god also / or els make ye tre evel & the frute of it likewise evel A good mā is knowne by his workes for a good man doth good workes & an euell evell workes
ye shall knowe thē by their frute / for a good tre bereth good frute / and an evell tre evell frute A man is likened to the tre and his workes to the frute of the tre Beware of ye false {pro}phetes whych come to you in shepes clothinge / but inwardlie they are raue¦ninge wolues.Mat. 7. ye shal knowe thē by their frutes None of oure workes neyther saue vs nor condempne vs. It is {pro}ued yt no workes make vs neyther righ¦twyse nor vnrightwyse / good nor evell / but first we are good ere we doo good workes & evell ere we do evell workes / ergo no workes neyther saue vs nor cōdēpne vs. Thou wilt saye / thē maketh it no matter what we do. I answere / yes. For if thou do evell / it is a sure argumēt yt thou arte evell / & wantest y• faith. If thou doo good it is an argumēt yt thou arte good & hast y• faith / for a good tre bereth good frute and an evell tre evell frute / yet good frute maketh not ye tre good / nor evell frute ye tre evell / so ye man is good ere he do good dedes ad evell ere he do evell dedes. The mā is y• thre / his workes are ye frute. Faith maketh ye good tre & incredulite ye evel tre such a tre such frute such a mā such wor¦kes. For all yt is done in faith pleaseth god & are good workes. And all y• is done with out faith displeaseth god and are evell workes. Vvho so ever beleueth or thinketh to be saued his workes denieth yt christ is his sauiour / yt chr¦ist dyed for him & all thinge yt {per}tayneth to christ. For how is he thy sauioure / it thou mightest save thy selfe by thy workes? or wherto shulde he dye for y• if any workes might have saued y•? what is this to saye / christ dyed for y•? verelye yt is / thou shuldest haue died {per}petuallye / & christ to delyver y• fro yt deeth / died for y• & chaunged thy
{per}petuall deeth in to his awne deeth. For thou madest y• faute / & he suffred ye payne / & yt for y• lo¦ue he had to the ere ever thou wast borne when thou haddest done neyther good nor evell. Now sith he hath payed thy dette thou nedest not: no thou canst not / but shuldest be dapned if his blo¦nde were not. But sith he was punished for the thou shalt not be punished. Finallye / he hath de¦lyvered ye frō thy condēpnaciō & all evell / & desy¦reth nought of the but yt thou wilt aknowlege what he hath done for y• & beare it in minde / & yt thou woldest helpe other for his sake both in worde & dede / evē as he hath holpē y• for nought & with out rewarde / O how readye wolde we be to helpe other / if we knewe his goodnesse & gent¦lenesse towardes vs. He is a good & a gentle lor∣de for he doth all for nought. Lette vs I besech you folow his fotesteppes whom all the worlde ought to prayse and worshuppe / Amen He that thinketh to be saved by his workes calleth him selfe Christ For he calleth him selfe his savioure whych partayneth to christ onlye. What is a sauioure but he yt saveth / & he sayeth I saue my selfe / w∣hich is as moch to saye as I am christ for christ onlye is the savioure of the worlde we shulde do no good workes for y• entēt to get¦te the enheritaunce of heavē or remissiō of sinne For who so ever beleveth to gette y• enherita∣unce of heavē or remissiō of sinne thorow wor∣kes / he beleueth not to gette yt for christes sake. And they yt beleue not yt their sinnes are forge∣uē thē and yt they shall be saved for christes sa∣ke / they beleue not y• gospell. For the gospell sa∣yeth / you shall be saued for christes sake / youre sinnes are forgeuē for christes sake. He yt bele∣veth not y• gospel heleueth not god. So it folo∣weth
yt they which beleve to be saved by their workes / or to gette remission of their sinnes by their awne dedes beleue not god: but recounte him as a lyar & so vtterlye denye him to be god. Thou wilt saye / shal we thē do no good dedes? I saye not so but I saye we shulde do no good workes for ye entēt to gette ye enheritaunce of heavē or remission of synne▪ For if we beleue to gette ye enheritaūce of heavē thorow good wor¦kes / thē we beleue not to gette it thorow ye pro∣mise of god: or if we thinke to gette remission of oure sinne the we beleue not yt they are forgeuē vs / & so we counte god a lyar. For god sayeth / thou shat haue ye enheritaunce of heauē for my sonnes sake / thy sinnes are forgeuē yt for mison¦nes sake & you saye it is not so / but I wil winne it thorow my workes. So I cōdēpne not good redis / But I codēpne ye false trust in anye wor¦kes / for al ye workes yt a ma putteth cōfidēce in are therwith poysoned & become evel. Therfore do ye good workes but beware you do thē not to gette any good thorow yt / for if thou do / thou receyvest the good not as the gifte of god but as dette to the and makest thy selfe felowe with god because thou wilt take nothinge of him for nought. what neadeth he any thynge of thyne which geveth al thinge & is not y• poorer? Ther∣fore do nothinge to him but take of him / for he is a getle lorde / & with a gladder wyll geueth vs all yt we nede / then we take it of him / therfore if we wāt ought let vs wyte oure selues. Preasse not then to ye enheritaunce of heuē thorow pre∣sumpciō of thy good workes for if thou do / thou countest thy silfe holye and egall to him because thou wilt take nothinge of him for nought: & so shalt thou falle as Lucifer felle for his pride. Finis.
