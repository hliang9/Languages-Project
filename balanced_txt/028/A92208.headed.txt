A Grain of Incense: OR, SVPPLICATION For the Peace of Jerusalem, the CHURCH and STATE. O Eternall God, and most gracious Father, abundant in mercy and truth, slow to an∣ger, and of great patience towards mise∣rable sinners, whose death thou desirest not, but their conversion; We humbly acknowledge, That not onely this heavy rod of Iron (wherewith thou dost now chastise us, in a dreadfull and devouring Civill War) is due untous, by reason of our great and grievous sins, but also all those plagues which thou hast sealed up in the Book of thy Laws, against obstinate and impenitent sinners: For we have broken all thy holy Commandments, in the thoughts of our corrupted hearts, words of impure tongues, and works of our sinfull hands; and that not in ignorance of thy holy will, that we might expect but few stripes, but even in the cleerest light of thy Gospel long bestowed upon us; nor out of infirmity onely, that we might thence pretend to some excuse, but out of wilfull presumption we have cast thy Laws behinde us, contemned thy Messengers, and stopped our ears to those gracious Conditions of mercy and
peace which thou hast with infinite mercy and long pati∣ence, sent to us by their Ministry, warning us of these very Iudgements which now are come upon us. O Lord, our sins have, like a filthy Leprosie, over-spread every part and faculty of our bodies and souls, so that we are become loathsom in thy sight, a sinfull Nation, a People laden with iniquity: there is nothing sound nor sincere in us, which sin, superstition, or profanation of thy holy Ordinan∣ces hath not polluted: the vices and uncleannesse of other Nations have flowed in upon us: As thou hast multiplied thy favours of peace and plenty upon us, so have we our re∣bellions against thee, and our impiety towards men: so that even the righteous become a prey, justice is turned into wormwood, truth vanished, oppression and rapine every where exercised, and blood toucheth blood: So that the cries of the injured, and deep sighing of the oppressed, daily as∣cendeth into thy holy presence, to provoke thy justice, and to solicite for revenge: And if we should be charged by none other witnesses, our own consciences convince us; if we might be our own judges, our hearts condemn us: So that we cannot but expect that thou, who art the great Iudge of all the world, shouldst now be avenged on this sinfull Nation. But yet the Sanctuary door is not shut up; yet thou, who still warnest us by thy Messengers to return every man from his wicked wayes, therein proferest mer∣cy and free pardon to all those who shall so do: Therefore, though our sins testifie against us, deal with us according to thy mercy: Thou hast not in vain invited the heavy la∣den to come unto thee, to call upon thee in the day of trou∣ble, that thou maist deliver them, and they glorifie thee. O Lord God of Truth, who never failest in any of thy promises, now ease us, grouing under the heavy burden of our calamities; now hear, and have mercy upon us, who call upon thee out of the deepest sense of our troublesse and helplesse perplexities: and Lord make no long tarrying, lest we be consumed by this fierre wrath which is come out of thy presence against us: Wherefore should our adversa∣ries rejoyce at our ruine, seeing thy holy Name is called up∣on
among us? Wherefore should our insulting enemies say in our destruction, Where is now their God, their Reli∣gion, who thus spoyl and destroy each other, seeing thou hast given us a glorious light of thy Gospel, that we might know thée? O Lord, when thou broughtest our Fathers from the kingdom of darknesse, into thy marvellous light, lea∣ving many millions to this day in their sins, and the region and shadow of death; it was not because they (or we, to whom thou continuest those favours) were better then o∣thers, but for thy own Names sake, and because thou hadst a favour to them and us. O Lord let it not seem little unto thee, That the paths of Sion mourn, That our fields are waste, That thy servants blood is openly shed, That so many weeping Rachells in the losse of their dear children, your out their afflicted souls before thee, That so many helplesse widows, in bitternesse of spirit, bewail their mur∣dered husbands, That death is come up into our win∣dows, and palenesse hath possessed every face, because fear, horrour, and terrible dread of utter ruine and desolation ap∣peareth on every side. Lord we have sinned; what shall we say unto thee, O thou preserver of man, save onely par∣don our sins? We are guilty, and have nothing to plead be∣fore thee, but onely thine own mercy; nothing to answer, but that thy Christ hath answered for us. O thou God of Truth, who hast promised to hear and grant whatsoever we ask in his Name: now, for his sake forgive us, now for thy wonted mercy sake, look upon our afflictions; cause the destroyers to sheath the sword again, that it may not be ex∣treme bitternesse in the end: Correct us not in thine anger, chasten us not in thy heavy displeasure, lest we be con∣sumed. Thy mercy is not changed, which wont to pardon and deliver thy sinning Israel, when they cryed unto thée in their distresses, and to be entreated of them, when they sought thée and thy saving health, though thou correctedst them with the rods of men; thine ear is not heavy, nor thine arm shortned: Lord, therefore in this Iudgement also, re∣member mercy; Lord hear the cries of thy faithfull ser∣vants
calling on thée day and night, and giving thée no rest, untill thou repair; let them through the merit and media∣tion of thy son Christ Iesus, prevail against all the cry∣ing sins of this Nation. Lord let thine arm help us, vain is the help of man; neither the counsells of the prudent, nor any arm of flesh can save us; thou onely canst, thou onely art our refuge; we have none other in heaven or earth to flie unto for deliverance; Lord reject us not who trust in thée: remove from us all those known and secret sins, which separate betwéen us and thy mercies, which have caused thée to take away thy Peace from us, and féed us with the bitter fruits of our own inventions, who loved not the bles∣sings of peace, and they are now far from us: Give us true and unfaigned Repentance, Humiliation, and amendment, from the first to the last, that thy indignation may cease from us: Heal our rebellions and back-slidings; binde up the wounds which our unnaturall and unhappy divisions have made in this Church and State; cure our distempers, reconcile us one to another, and all to thée in Christ Iesus: give us grace to kéep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace: Restore us the life of Religion, beauty of holinesse, mark of thy son Christs disciples, badge of true Christi∣ans, ornament of the Gospel, and the happy condition of the primitive Saints, Love and Charity; restrain all those desperate spirits of Division, which for our unthankfulnesse and surfeiting on thy blessings of peace, thou hast justly permitted to come out of the bottomiesse pit amongst us: give us in these dayes of our visitation, a prudent know∣ledge of those things which concern our Peace: Take a∣way those fears and jealousies which now unhappily have armed every man against his neighbour: Remove all those Schisms and Factions which any way obscure the Lamps of thy Tabernacle, and the light of Truth: Suppresse all the secret and professed Incendiaries, who kindle sedition, and endeavour to lay waste Cities and Villages, and to even the Palace and Cottage in one common ruine. Lord blesse thine Anoynted Servant, our Soveraign Lord the King, in the safety of His Royall Person, Crown
and Dignity; in His gracious Consort, and those hope∣full Plants which thou hast set about his Table, The Roy∣all Issue: Establish His Throne with Righteousnesse; Give an happy Vnderstanding and Accord betwéen Him and His great Counsell the Parliament: Counsell them with thy Wisedom, let thy fear rest on them, so that all their Consulations may be blessed, that Truth, Iustice, and Peace may be restored, and abundantly flourish amongst us again, that we may make a right use of thy fatherly corrections, by fearing thy holy Name, detesting and forsaking our sins, learning hereafter better to value the swéet and comfortable fruits of long Peace, by a short want thereof, and praising thée for thy clemency and tender mercy, in the Congregation of thy Saints. And now, O Lord, as thou hast commanded us, we hum∣bly intreat thée, as for our selves, so for thy distressed ser∣vants in Ireland; Lord cover their heads in the dayes of Battle, teach their hands to war, and their fingers to fight; leade their Leaders, and counsell their Counsellors, thou who canst make one to chase a thousand, and as easily deliver by few as by many (because thou onely art the Lord of Hosts, the Battle is thine, and thou only givest Victory unto kings) Help them against their numerous enemies; Take the Honour unto thine own self (as is most due) make it appear to all the world, That thou never rejectest the petitions of humble and contrite hearts, nor forsakest those who put their trust in thée: Lord command their deliverance and ours: Let us not be like that distres∣sed woman, so long languishing, till all be spent on help∣lesse Physitians; Let our miseries come speedily into thy gracious presence, that touching the hem of thy Garment (that tender mercy and compassion wherewith thou art clothed) these issues of blood may spéedily be stayed. O Lord encline thine ear, and hear us; O Lord consider and do it: Lord hear our Prayers for them, and theirs for us, and both for thy beloved Son, our blessed Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ his sake. Amen. FINIS.
