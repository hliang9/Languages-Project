IR A REMONSTRANCE CONCERNING THE PRESENT TROUBLES FROM THE MEETING OF THE ESTAEES OF the Kingdome of SCOTLAND, Aprill 16. unto the Parliament of ENGLAND. Printed in the Year of God. 1640.
A REMONSTRANCE CONCERNING THE PRESENT TROUBLES FROM THE MEETING OF THE ESTAEES OF the Kingdome of SCOTLAND, Aprill 16. unto the Parliament of ENGLAND. WHEN we look unto the Records of the ages past, to find out the greatest blessings that God hath bestowed on this ILE, wherin we live, we cannot but acknowledge, that next to the Christian Faith, the Union of the two King∣domes under one Head, doth by many degrees exceed all other that fall in the reckoning. Many practises and policies were set afoot by our Princes of old, to hasten this work: but all in vain did the plots of men strive to crosse or prevent the councell of God, who had reserved for us and our fathers that singular happi∣nes, to see that Union begun neither by a breach of faith, nor by bloud, but as the gift of God, to fall in our hands by the ordi∣nary gate which the Princes right sets open unto all, and the generall and common interest of both Nations did heartily re∣ceive and imbrace. With what successe this Union hath be∣gun and continued to this day, the peace and plenty we have enjoyed all this time, can witnesse in part, whiles all the rest of Europe almost, round about us, hath been a Field of blood and desolation. What apprehension the enemies of our Religion had at our peaceable conjunction, and with what eye of jealou∣sie
the neighbour States did look upon us, and envie our hap∣pines, the History of these times can beare record: but for the present, in regard of what hath passed these many yeares by∣gone, and what we presently feel and fear, we may truly con∣fesse to our own guilt and great dishonour, that neither Scotland nor England unto this day hath righty understood or made use of this ra blessing of heaven, for increasing their respect abroad, or securing teir own safety at home; neither have the reformed Churches found tha comfort and relief which they did expect from us in the day of teir distresse, but on the contrary we have been made, even against ou wills, a brkn reed, a rocke of offence, and a shipwrack unto all that have fought unto us for shelter from the storme, and to our selves the one Nation against the other, a rod of correction and jealousie, in the hands of a few wicked and ungodly men, men of sepration, who divide the King from his people, and the people om their King; and who raise up brethren agint brethren that they in the end might prey and make havock of all. Amongst many that have been authors of these evils under which the two Kingdoms have for a long time groaned, and belike must either now or never be disburthened, none deserve so justly to be challenged in the first place as some amongst you who call themselves Church∣men, but have left their station to become ignorant and un∣happy Statesmen, who have made the Church and the Tenets therof, an instrument of bondage to the Subject, of liberty to themselves, and of unjust usurpation to the Prince, whom we had reason to feare long agoe by your example, and whom we find named as the chief instrument and object of your just feares of the change of Religion and government of Estate in the Ringdome of England, in that grave and solemn Remonstrance that was made not many yeares agoe, by the house of Com∣mons to the Kings Majesty, if that had stopped them any way, your pulpits and pamphlets can beare witnesse for them and the rest of their crue since that time, yea how constant they are to thee wretched ends, their attempts upo us, and that deep plot of obruding the seeds of all Popish superstition and tyranny, upon our Kirk, in the Bookes of Common Prayer, and Canons, will be a strong evidence for them how much they have deserved of Rome, to make that Kirk which had departed farthest from her to be fist in the return, and exemplar unto others and how much more they may yet deserve of them, and all the enemies of those tw
Kingdomes, if they ffer for a sacrifice in a blodie Warre, th Relgon and Liberties of both the Nations, to appease the fury o ther presn disappintment, and prevent the shame of their deeved all. Certaily the posterity will hardly beleeve as we who have ee it cannot but wonder) how it hath come to passe, that the Subjects of Scotland (whose Union with Engld this day is known to be of gear foce, or her assurance at home, and strengh abroad, then all the alliances, pratises, policies, conquess your Pinces have made from the beginig) hould have so long peitioned their native Prince rsidig amongst you to do them Jstice wherf he is debtor to his peple, and to heare their just complaints against the usrpaion of a ew men, who were undermining the poess ligion and government of the State, and to suffer them to live according to their Laws, and yet could never be head nor answered in the poin of their just desires, farre lesse will they guesse what hath been the ground of that merit and trust of one domineering Prlat in the affection of the Prince, that it should be more forcible to disswade, then all the supplications and intrcssions of so ancient and faithfull a Ntion, who amog all the Kingdomes of Europ have longest continued and mainaied in one Line the honour of the Royall Crown, togeher with he preservation of their own Liberties, should have power to move. Truly for our selves when we call to mind what courage and costancie God hath given unto s since the beginning of these troubles, o stand for the maintenance of our Religion and Liberties, that we have not suffered our selves to be drawn headlong unto the ser∣vitde of souls and bodies, from which there had been no hope of Liberty for us or our poerity, and which in regard of ou conjunction with you under one King, had been a violent pre∣judice, and of dangerous conseuence for your Liberties when they come to be questioned in their own time and place, and on the other part when we remember what strange and violent wayes were taken by our adversaries to keep from the Englis Nation the knowledge of our affaires, and what unjust and false aspersions were laid upon all our acions and intentins to pro∣voke you to be actors of that renge that was determined a∣gainst us by the insolent advice of such who now govern his Majesties Councels, and ettle their own ill acquired geatnes by the oppression of his obedient Subjects in their Religion and li∣berties in both Kingdomes, we cannot but blsse God who armed u with an invinsible paience and resolution to eshew for our part
the uttermost of our power any Nationall breach: For ye may remember when cotrary to our expectation his Majesty by all the evil councell of those men, did march towards us with an Armie, we neglected all courses which might advance our humane safety, rather then start from any jot of our obedience, or give any seeming distaste to our deare Brethren of England, and rather adventured the ruine of our own Countrey, then indangered theirs: Yea further, when we did with horrour and amazement heare those unexampled Proclamations given out against a whole Nation, who were never tainted with the least thought of disobedience to their Prince his just commands, accor∣ding to the rule of their Lawes, Notwithstanding of this great provcation, there was nothing to be heard amongst us but vows for his Majesties prosperity, and hearty desires from all to spend their bloud for the increase of his estate, and service of his Crown, and who abhorred then to be reduced to that extremi∣ty, as to arme themselves for their own defence and preservation. It will scarcely be beleeved by Strangers, by what means two Nations so near together, and so straitly tyed in all the bonds of goodwill and mutuall respect, where there was so little cause of espousing these quarrells, wherin none of the Nations were concerned or wronged by the other in their own proper rights, should be brought to such a posture, and near so dangerous a rupture, that would not been easily (to say no more) peced up again in our dayes, but it was the worke of God, and it should be wonderfull in our eyes, who in the carriage of all this great busines, hath made every stoppe and et casten in by the adver∣sary, a step of advancement, to the furthering of his Cause, as is well known and acknowledged by all whom God hath honoured to be the least instruments in this work, who also made this a singular meane to testifie our loyaltie, and the sincerity of our hearts, where we presented our humble and just desires unto his Majesty, and for the honour of the cause which we maintain, and the tender regard to the credit of our own Prince (although then armed against his own people) and for the brotherly respect unto the Nobility, and others of our neighbour Nation, in∣ending nothing, we beleeve, but to follow the King, although really saisfying the ambiion and bloud thirsing revege of a mi∣serable Prelat. We laboured in the treatie to give all satisfacti∣on on our part that could be required of most loyall Subjects, and sensible of our Kings honour ourenemies being judges) even to our own apparent disadvantage, for we delivered all
places into his Majesties hands, which were desired, in testi∣mony of our obedience, and although they might have been in our hands, pledges of assurance for performance of these Arti∣cles that were agreed to be granted in the following Assembly and Parliament; and now contrary to our expectation are turn∣ed for Engines of terrour, and Fetters of slavery to frustrate us from obtayning the benefit of that capitulation. Notwithstand∣ing of all breach of promise we cannot but professe according to our tender respect to our Prince, wherein we are inwardly gieved for the dishonour that is done to his Majesty by the bad instruments that are about him, that neither we were then ever-reached, nor do we yet repent upon our part for that great trust and confidence we reposed upon his Majesty, for we did then remember that we were dealing with our Prince, with whom as we should not strive for appurtenaces, when the maine was granted, so we might rest assured, that if he could not be brought in his own mind to judge aright how farre he had been misled against us his own people, who had given such an ample testimony of our trust, and of the interest we should have in his favour above all other, but still continue to pursue any advantages to our prejudices: we did not otherwise think but when ever he had a minde to breake, he could never want ill grounded pretence, to alledge against us; and it was fittest for us rather to hazard the disadvantage, and commit the suc∣cesse to God what ever prejudice we should suffer; for if the word of a King which should be the Oracle of truth to his people, and the faith of promises and contracts under hand and seale, which is the ground-work of trust in all humane society, and is sacred and inviolable amongst Infidels and Turks, may not justly challenge for us the performance of the Articles of the Treaty upon his Majesties part, then may we truly think that nothing we could have framed or desired then, would have been for our safety of any avail unto us, as nothing had done us good or succeeded according to our minde in all these things we have condescended unto (wherunto we were not oblidged by any duty or respect whatsoever, otherwise then that we might not be defrauded of the full and reall performance of the Articles of agreement) but on the contrary it doth evidently appeare by all that hath past, that there hath been no desire nor meaning of peace in the hearts and minds of our adversaries unto this day; for all the businesse of the capitulation hath been taken by them as a cloak to cover their more cunning and crafty
designes, hoping thereby to weaken us in time by their wicked policie, whom they could not then overcome by open force: making us a how to dissolve all Forces on either side that they might lay the Foundation of a more dureable warre, by setting strong Garrisons on the Border, receiving he strong holds of the Kingdome to be keeped after that condition they were in before these troubles began, and presently preparing them for nests of violence to the chief parts of the Kingdome: Calling forth by his Majesties letters a great number of our chief men under weak pretences of businesse (when all the matters of the treaty had been ended with a few of that number) unto Barwick, and when some of them came, keeping matters in the clouds untill the rest were come, and sending them back again like stales to bring in their fellows, and when this did not hold, laying then plots deep and a farre off to entrap some of our principall men, as God hath wonderfully discovered since, and will more and more to the confusion of these who have been authors and abetters to such base assasinats. And which hath been the master-piece of their ubtill device: suffering the Assembly to goe on and determine all matters of the Kirk that had been in question. The Commissioner in the Kings name consenting to all the Acts that passed, promising also to ratifie them all in the Parliament that was presently to follow, plot∣ting hereby that what they gave with the one hand, they would take away with the other, for this seeming of setling matters in the Assembly, and withholding the civill sanction of the Par∣liament for their being and existance in the Common-wealth, as it would make them really of no effect, so it did gain a co∣lour and pretext to that designe they did most intend: that the next rupture, to which they were preparing, should not be for matters of Religion which were all setled in the Assembly, as they did alledge, but for other civill differences in the Com∣mon-wealth, and truly in all appearance the matters of the Kirk were setled in that Assembly, with the consent of the Commissioner, but that wise men began to doubt of the since∣rity of the work, when they found him by his after declarati∣ons and explanations digging  posterne to escape and make way, for his after denall of what had been concluded. And in these tearms the Parliament did begin, and hath continued not to settle the affairs of the Kirk as was promised, and was cer∣tainly expected by us: but to bring in a precedent of servitude (which neither we no our Fathers were acquainted with) and
so it hath been broken off and adjourned, by his Majesties own authority, without consent of the states, which is dictly against the aws and praciss of this Kingdome, and contrary to the Articles of agrement: And although our predecessours took another course, yet we came onely with supplications and prayers, and to shew our invincible obedience unto his Majesty, sent up our Commissioers to London, who were rejected, and never seen nor heard, and yet hoping with this unexampled patience to overcome the malice of our adversaries, we send up again our Commissioners with propsitions that were so just, as that they contained nothing but what was before granted unto us, under his Majesties hand and seal, nor could receive any denyall from a picus and just Prince, as being all comprehended in this. And which had been the summe and subject of all our supplications, protestations, informations, declarations, from the be∣ginning, namely, that the Fundamentall Laws of the King∣dome, which had been violated, and the Religion which was manifestly infringed, might in a free Assembly and Parliament be again confirmed, and the unworthy authors legally questio∣ned, and which had been more expresly set down in the Arti∣cles of pacification, that as there according to the tenor of the Articles of agreement, all matters civill were to be judged by Parliaments, and all Ecclesiasticall matters by the assemblies of the Kirk: And that as the Assembly promised by his Majesty had been granted and had concluded the differences of the Kirk, so his Majesty would not delay or deny the conclusion of the Parliament, for ratifying the acts of this Assembly, and settling other differences of the Common-wealth, a was fully agreed in that Treatie at the Kings Camp, yet these propositions and desires being so necessarie and vitall unto this Kingdome could find no accesse unto the eares of the gracious King, by reason of the powerfull diversion of the Archbishop of Canter∣bury, and Deputie of Ireland, who (strengthened with the high and mighty Faction of Papists neare his Majesty) onely side in all matters of spirituall and temporall affairs, and makes the ne∣cessity of their service to his Majesty appear in being the only fit instruments (under the pretext of vindicating his Majesties honour) to oppresse both the just liberties of his free Subjects, and the true reformed Religion in all his Kingdomes. In which devilish designe, we have great cause to say they are far advanced, if the granting of a free Assembly and Parliament to us at this time, which hath been the ground of all our just de∣sires
from the beginning, and the conclusion of the Treati this last yeare, as the onely mean to cure all the evills of Kirk and State, and settle the peace and welfare of both Kingdomes, Prove in the end, as it appeareth this day, like the Councel of Trent to the Christian Kirk, which was appointed for reforming, the abuse therof, yet through the ambition and covetousnesse of Kirk-men and the miserable jealousies of the Princes of the time, who minded more their private end and interest then the cause of Christ and his Kirk, was found in effect the active en∣gine and instrument to establish and settle the tyranny of the Pope and his Clergie: wherfore the greater and more lively are our apprehensions of danger at this time, that all these cooked and crosse plots, interchecking one another, in deny∣ing a Parliament to us, where it was promised upon the honour of a King, and for the safety of two such Nations, in granting it unto you, where it was not expected, for the reasons that all wise men cannot but remember, and in forcing one upon Ire∣land, where none is desired: Giving out Commissions to de∣stroy us before we can apprehend any other or new guiltinesse, but that we have been constant suters for the conclusion of the Parliament, and the fulfilling of the Articles of the treaty, raising our Parliament contrary to the Laws, and the expresse Articles of the agreement; inforcing Garisons upon us, that they might force us to a necessary denyall of such unreasonable demands, and to a necessity to provide for our selves: that all these, we know, are done and devised to pick a quarrel, and to be the ground of a false and wyre drawn Remonstrance against us, and now by the particular instigation of these men we na∣med before, a mighty army is preparing, and an utter ruine threatned to our Religion and Countrey. Lest in regard of these premisses, our silence in so necessary a time should argue a neglect of our duty to God and our King, the safety and honour of our Conntrey, the peace and elfare of both the Nations, what so nearly trenches to the prejudice and hazard of all these, cannot be longer forborne; Therfore we professe before the Christian world, and to our dear brethren of England, especially the representative Body of the Kingdome, now happily convey∣ned in both the Houses of Parliament, whom it most concerns, that we cannot otherwise judge and esteem, but that all these Councels that have been given of late by these intemperat Counsellors, who direct the course of all affaires, do not onely proceed from such persons as to serve their own ends under
colour of advancing his Majesties Prerogative, doe weaken Royall power, and bring the Kingdomes unto confusion, but that they truly are first hammered in Spain and in the Conclave, and put into the hand of their cunning Artisans among you, who have ever been a viperous brood, which with tooth and naile, have assayed to rent the bowels of their own mother, yea who never sooner learned to obey the Roman Church as their mother, but assoon they acknowledged the Catholick King for their Father, and their own King for an usurper, if they think him to be an Heretick So that we are perswaded that neither the invincible Armado of the eighty eight, nor the Gun-powder plot, nor any other Royall Navie from thence, like unto that which came the other yeare upon your coast, (the which ye had the more reason to suspect that it came so un∣looked for and at so unseasonable a time) needs to be attempted any more for the ruine of this Ile, but onely hat they be care∣full (as we doubt not they are) that the fire of this civil warre which hath been so long smoaking may be once kindled, and that they be ready under-hand to adde fewell to the flame, wherin they will not be wanting, especially where every thing is so near that can furnish matter, and all is farre off that can help to extinguish the same, when it is once begun, yea, which is worse for us all, when it is apparent, that it cannot be setled without great hazard even of them that may seem to over∣come in the end: And although that we may justly suspect that this calling of you together at this time by their suggestion, who have raised this fire of civil discord in this famous Isle without your consent or advice, be rather to perswade you to bring oyle then water to quench the flame, so that in the heat of these broyles you may be induced to contribute to the over∣throw of your best friends, while they avenge themselves of their enemies: Notwithstanding of this, we hope that it will not be displeasant unto all good men in these honourable As∣semblies of both houses, that we with great joy of heart and freedome of spirit professe and declare, as we do this day, that all our obligations and mutuall assurances of love and brothterly kindnesse are so nearly twisted and joyned together with you in all duties toward God and Man, Prince and People, that we cannot but have the same friends and foes, either in the defence of our common safety against forraigne foes, or in the maintenance of our severall rights against inward and homebred underminers who are more dangerous, except we would depart from the
onely firme rule of our own safety and preservation. And ther∣fore since in regard of the situation of this whole Isle, and the Union under one Head, we are all, as it were, one house, if it fall we shall be all buried in the ruines, we are all imbarqued in one ship, if it perish or split upon the rocks of division, hardly can we escape: Suffer us to reoyce with you in the midst of this storm, for this first sunne-shine of comfort and good hope that we see you who are the true Pilots, brought to the helm: And give us leave to conjure you for the interest we have in the common adventure of these rich goods, our peace, our liber∣ties, our Religion, which are all in one hold, that ye abandon not the ship of the Common-wealth in this tempest, although it did belong to you to have been called when the season was more calme, and yet let it be the true ground of your comfor and encouragement, that when the skie was clear, you have fore∣warned our great Master, of the clouds that were gathering, and although the winds were invisible then to most, yet to many of your house of Commons, and others also of all ranks: they that did blow then to gather these clouds together, were well known, and from what coast they came, and many hum∣ble desires and earnest suites have been made by you to his gra∣cious Majesty, that he would not abandon his own and the Kingdomes safety, unto the pleasure of men in a voyage full of dangerous and fearefull straits, in the conduct of which, they had nothing but their own ambition and privat gain, for com∣passe and said. And who have thrust both Prince and people out of the safe harbour of the quiet calme unto this present storme, wherin they are to make profit of both our shipwrack, if in this strait it were not allowed to the meanest passenger to give warning of the imminent danger, we notwithstanding of our place and interest in your welfare might hold our peace: but since we have been in the first watch, and have indured the first and greatest torment of this storme, while you have been at rest; for your assurance that we cannot abandon you, or leave you alone one your turne, when you are so near to give tryall of your courage and skill, you may perceive by what hath pas∣sed, that no Assembly nor Parliament, no rotten Cable, and slip∣ping Anchor of Articles and agreement, whereunto we had fastened our hopes, can be any road and harbour of safety unto us, so long as both our enemies sit at the Helme and govern all courses that are to be followed amongst you. Therfore before we come to advise what are in our judgement the most
itting means or removing of the evils of us both, give us leave to touch in passing what we apprehend have been the concurrent causes to bring you by degrees from that height of appinsse, wherin somtime ye were glorious in the sight of Europe, to this gulf of misery and abasement wherein ye have fallen, and drawn us by example and imitain, that in this sad represnment, as in a darke shade, the glorious light of your appearing day may be more comfortable and refreshing unto us both, which is the hearty with and assured hope of your dear Brethren in Scotland, because of the sensible feeling of that great mercy of God upon themselves, who have been farther in the transgression, and at a lower ebbe in mind and spirit then ye can well imagine before their troubles began; therfore, because our evils are not of yesterday, and could not have over∣flowd the face of this Isle on a sudden, let us search up unto the well head and period of time, whee and when they bgan fist to spring and arise, when we left to fear others by reason of our Union then began we to have need to look for evill from our selves: the subile enemies of this Isle knowing that what was not to be attempted by open force, was to be udertaken and pursued by cunning and secret practises, took the advantage of the humours of men, following commonly the nature and the conditions of the times, did make the surfets and ease of peace more dangerous to the life of the Estate, then the straits and hazards of warre had been before, disposing the Subjects to ease and slavery, an inuring the Prince to follow their appetite and the rules of uncontrouled power: then began the publicke wayes of honour and reptation to be unrequented: then the use of Parliaments which is the stay and strength of your Kingdom to be suspected, and so these eyes and eares of the Prince and People, the great Councel of the Land did make way peece and peece to the darke passages of the corner of a Cabinet, where flatterie, malice, envy and partialitie amongst few hands, disguises with alse appearances without controule all that comes in their handling, and makes the people miserable, and the Prince infortunat, since they have gotten ooting, Parli∣ments have been called not to ease the grievances of the Subject, but to supply the necessities of the Prince, and so whereas they should have helped to cur, they have increa∣sed the diseases of the ESTATE: and because there can be no evill humour in the Body that can master your skill, if you please to apply fitting remedies, and what hav
been formerly in practise, therfore you are made to disagree amongst your selves about the method of the cure, and when you begin to incline to an agreement your consultations are bro∣ken off, and so by these meanes the Common wealth langui∣sheth without hope of relief, the Princes mistakes and the Peo∣ples grief and burthens doe equally increase, and every breach of a Parliament begets a new grievance and maladie to the peo∣ple, so much the more dangerous and dadly, that the Authors of these abuses) when you use not your courage and constancie to maintain that power and place which your Predecessors have put in your hands, and wherof the posterity will call you to accompt, as a right of entaile and their proper inheritance which cannot be weakened in your hands without your eter∣nall infamie, and their endlesse losse) begin to despise you, and take courage to undermine and blow up the foundation of your once well setled Etate: bringing you in contempt with the people, for the guard of whose liberties you have so long con∣tinued, and in hatred with the Prince, for whose honour and safety it hath alwayes been, that none about him should be more powerfull, nor the Laws, and nearer him in place and affection, then you whose Councells could not be corrupted by ends: these are they who bringing you once to mind your owne things, and to be carelesse of the Publick, have teached the Princes, that all the rights and liberties of the Subject, and the maintenance of them, are doales of grace, and gifts of meere favour proceding from the Prince and not the true birth right of the Subject which they may truly challenge) which are to be continued or changed as ther Princes shall think fit: who have teached Princes to use that maxime in a free Kingdome to wrong ends: Parliaments are in their power to begin, conti∣nue, and break them off, as they find the fruit of them good or bad, so are they to have their being, or not to be at all, thus they have done what is in them to make the Royall authority, which should be like a Sun beame shining for the comfort and light of others, turn to a Comet and blazing star, a matter of wonder and admiration for the time, and a prognostick of worse things to follow. Truly the prerogative of the Prince, which hath been keeped in veneration, and as a secret untouched amongst the wisest Princes and the best times; which is that which the Laws have given him above all private men, for the common safety of us all, and cannot be used to another end, but for our good, had not suffered so much in it self, and lost of its proper
lustre, by the oft and common handling therof, to the manie prejudice of the Subjects right, and the reall weakening of the true Royall power, had it not falne in some of your Clergies hand, who to the staine of the Kirk and the bane of the Com∣mon-wealth, have subjected all men, and all Laws, to the ap∣petite of the Prince, of whom they have the absolute rule, that so under that goodly visour of his Royall power, they may accomplish at last that great designe of the change of the Re∣ligion and government of the Estate which they have so long amed at: whereof they cannot faile in this happy conjuncture, where all things promises them good successe. A Prince en∣raged against his own native people, by their procurement, who will not be perswaded that they are good Subjests to him, be∣cause they are avowed enemies to them, who have ben the destroyers of their Religion, and the toubles of the peace of the Kirk, to whom it is necessary that he forget that he is their naturall Prince, while he remembers that he is advanced to be the Monarch of the whole Ile, and with whom of necessity he is obliged to continue in this quarrel, that under the pretext of their rebellion, he may have leisure to arme, and make the one Kingdome a scourge to the other, while in the end they both become slves, which if they refuse, he cannot eschew of force to bring in strangrs, and use such other power as God hath put in his hands by the doctrine of these good divines, to the establishing of the boundlesse government wherat they ayme, so by the joynt helpe of the Papist, who are a strong Faction amongst you of late, and of others, whom they call good Sub∣jects, and are the greatest number, who while they are going on in any course to helpe themselves, cannot think they are accomptable to God or Man for any wrong they are doing to others, these also concuring who are of great number and of no small force in any state, who are content to wear fetters them∣selves, so they may be of gold, and they have the making of them, or helpe therunto for others, all these meeting together, they cannot misse to effectuat their designes, and these are they who look at this time to undoe us, and hope assuredly to work you to their ends. And for this effect, as it appeares, are ye called together after so many breaches and breaking up of Parliaments in England, whereby his Majesty had been deprived of the faithfull councels and free aides of his people hereto∣fore, and the pressures and grievances of the Subjects daily more and more increased without hope of reliefe, that all
men (who looked upon the train of affaires, and marked wha undue courses had been taken of late, that there should be no need of their meeting, and how the number and height of offenders is increased, for whose safety it is not that Parliaments come in place and request again) may justly marvell to see this day, and in all likely-hood conjecture that either this Parlia∣ment will prove the happiest that ever was in this Isle for the good and peace of the Kingdomes, or else (which God forbid) will become the fatall engine and axletree in our enemies hand, for the overthrow of Kirk and State, turning our doubts unto despaires, and our feares into a certainty of confuion. Wher∣fore the more need have all good men who love the truth of Religion, the honnour of the King, the safety of the Kingdomes in so necessary and perillous a time to be instant with God by Fasting and Prayer that as the beginning of your meeting to∣gether is the subject of all mens feares and hopes, good or bad, o the close may be in fruit and memory the joy of the present age, and the blessing of posterity, whereof there is no small ground of hope at this time; For if that spirit of wisdome, courage, and true zeale for the good of Religion, and safety of King and Kingdomes do but begin as in former time to appeare in your Councels, who knoweth what recompence God is preparing for your often disappointments in that kind: the which we are moved he rather to beleeve and expect, that the powerfull hnd of God hath forcibly led them who have been the authors of your evils, and actours in the mischief intended against us; against their will to call for your assistance to oppresse us: and suely we think that what Art can invent, and malice can doe, will not be wanting (even amongst some of your number) to move th rest to consider aright of all the advantages of the time, and reconceal the differences that are amongst them∣selves and labour to seek the ease of your own burthens when you may have them at an easie rate with small expense and paines, to increase ours, and many specious pretences will be offeed, to hide the bad intentions of a few, and the ill conse∣quences of their privat designes against the publick quiet of the Kingdomes, but certainly a thick cloud of prejudices and misrepresentaions of all our businesses most assuredly be casten before your ees, and great must that darknesse be, before so wise, so advised a judicatorie of all the choice wits in that King∣dome condescend to that resolution which in effect carrieth with it, in furthering the overthrow of our Religion and Li∣berties,
and in the buriall therof to begin and digge a Tomb for your own to follow, and to make the end of this Parliament a mean that there should never be need of any hereafter. But we expect (Right Honourable) better things of you, and such as belong properly to the happinesse of this time, for the glory of God in the advancement of his truth, for the honour of the King in punishing of the wicked, for the welfare of the King∣domes, that in our Union they may be crushed, who in our division have builded their hopes, and made this warre with your Brethren, the Trojan horse to bring in all these calami∣ties, which a Civill warre will undoubtedy inforce upon this Ile, and we are certainly perswaded that the singular wisdome and justice of your Honouable Court, which can have no other end in all their Counsell, but the service of his Majesty, and the safety of his Kingdomes (which cannot be separated in any consideration whatsoever) will judge otherwise of the state of our affairs, and affoord us better measure then we have found as yet at the hands of these men, who as they have been the Authors of our evil, and of that corruption that was creeping in, in Kirk and State, so have both you and we suffered much more by them, and have greater reason to complain of the in∣convenience and mischie of the remedie that they have ap∣plyed since, then of the disease it selfe: In vain doe they think to cover their wicked designes with the bare pretext of their zeale and affection to his Majesties greatnes and dignity, seeing it tends to the ruine and destruction of his faithfull Subjects, whose riches is his treasure, whose quiet is his glory, whose hearts and affections are his strong garisons that cannot be overcome, and whose prsperity is the happines of his Crown, and miserable and wretched are the effects of that power, which produceth no∣thing but weaknes to the Prince, and calamity to his Subjects, and in vain do we expect that God will blesse in our age what he hath cursed in all ages before. Let us look unto the Re∣cords of former ages, and we shall ever find, that there is not any thing that doth so much move the wrath of God, as to see his worship and Churches profaned, and to fall into the hands of these who have sold themselves to the world, and are de∣vouted to the Temporall service of the Prince: where ever it hath been practised, it is a certain demonstration of the altera∣tion and change of an Estate, and of their miseries and disgrace who abuse it licentiously, their affaires alwayes declining even unto their end. We need not put you in mind of the stues
and hot contests of your best Princes, and of greatest spiri with your Archbishops at home, to keep down that Papac they claymed to themselves amongst you, and to suffer them to be Kings beside them, which could not be granted but at their discretion: they that lookt to the dangers of this time, and who they are that be the Authors of this mischief inten∣ded, may easily perceive, that if all the Subjects of the two Kingdomes could be moved to undergoe that burthen the Bi∣shop of Canterbury and his followers would put upon us, and could be peswaded in Conscience, that we were bound to obey these spirituall Fathers in all their commands, we should soon see they would alledge some other ground for their as∣piring greatnesse, then the zeale of his Majesties service and honour, and the Princes that are to follow would find, that all their paines was for themselves, and to establish their own ty∣ranny over Prince and People. Or, are there any so ignorant and wilfully blind to think, that all that spight and malice they carry to the Covenant of Scotland is, because that it hath weak∣ned the Kings power, and made his Majestie appeare so in the sight of his enemies? If this were true, then would the Pope and the King of Spaine give many millions that the like were in England and Ireland: they need not dissemble, we know where it pricks them, they see the hand of God in it against their un∣just usurpation and worldly pomp, and they feare, that as they have found it a wall of brasse to the Subjects of Scotland against the fury of their malice, when they could have no protection, neither in their Laws, nor in their Prince, in whose saving favour they may claim speciall interest, so it may prove by ex∣ample dangerous to them elswhere, and at once put an end to all these plots and designes they have to overthrow the refor∣med Religion: And this is the cause they charge it and us with many crimes, to plant the hatred of us and that cause in the hearts of others, which is already ingraven in theirs, but we are assured the equitie, justice, and wisdome of your Court will be farre from thinking this a sufficient ground of quarrell betwixt the two Nations, because we demand to enjoy the benefit of our Laws, and the exercise of our Religion, if this be a cause that any of your Nation should come to assaile us, or any part of the power of that Kingdome should be imploy∣ed to that use, you would not have taken it in ill part or think we have done you wrong, if the like course had been taken by us when there were any contests and dispute betwixt his
Majestie and you in your Parliaments for the rights of the Subject: But as we have alwayes wished you good successe unto your Paliaments, so can we not think that the paines we have taken to maintain our own rights, can be grievances unto you, or of evill example to weaken your estate, or move you to destroy us. Princes when they are misled by evill counsell, may easily begin warre at thei pleasure, but since the Subjects blood must determine the controversie, it were necessary that they who have so great a part of the hazard, should also know their quarrel. And since civill warre and homebred division as inward diseases are more hard to cure then these that are without, we are tyed in all respects to seek to prevent them before thy come. And wheras by all that hath passed, we may perceive that these who are chief actors in these troubles, eek by all means to have us engaged, the more should our care be to preserve our selves by their disappointment, and by a seaso∣nable remedy, provide for the safety of our selves and posterity. The readiest meane for the present that can come in our con∣sideration in this, that as when the treatie of the Union was intended, but did not take effect, the two Parliaments did sit, and did appoint their Commissioners to treat thereanent (with expresse reservation of their own Lawes and Liberties) and to report their proceedings back againe to them that sent them, so now when the two Nations are ready to be plunged in a bloudy warre, to the overthrow of the Liberties of both. Our soules desires, that his Majesty would be pleased to appoint the like or any other meane whereby the Parliaments may sit freely, and without feare of force, and by their Commissioners appoint time and place, where by their scanning the equity or inquity of our demands may be fully weighed, that we may no longer suffer by false and artificiall relations, but they be no∣turly known as they are, and their fraud and hypocrisie disco∣vered (if there be any) for we shunne no tryall which is not inconsistent with a free and independent Kingdome, and which the Kingdome of England would choose in the like case of the quarreling of their Laws and liberties, the King being resident amongst us: for which end if his Majesties forces may be dis∣charged, and his further Levies suspended, we will most gladly disband, and leave off any that we are preparing for our own ne∣cessary and just defence, which otherwise we cannot doe without our own apparent ruine, neither can the Parliament sit with any security in either Kingdome, if they see a Sword drawn ove
thei heads, and this we know the Parliament of England in their wisdome will think very reasonable, and the least that can be granted, and will joyne with us in this peition for their own clearing before God and the world, that they have not taken in hand to subdue us by armes, before they have convinced us and made known to all true Christians and honest men, for what cause, and upon how great reason. If this be denyed us, as what may we not expect in this kind, but that the conduct of this affaie will be answerable to the first undertaking: And as this plot hath been set on foot for the benefit of strangers, so it will be continued to the weak∣ning of both the Kingdomes the overthrow of our Religion, and civill liberties, to the uttermost of their power. So we (that the close of this discourse may bring in a short view all that hath been touched before) cannot but begin with this, that it is jst with God to make us feel the sad efects of civill discord, who have not mae the right use of our long enjoyed peace, and that we suffer in the danger and hazard of the cure, who have so long by our tollerance and permission strengthned that ill humour, which is now ready to master the life both of Kirk and State. You are called together who are the great Physitians of that State, it is not unfitting for the present oc∣casion to put you in minde of an old tle that belongeth unto your Art: Philotimus a Physician in Greece, made this answer to one who offered his finger to dresse, by whose face, look and breath, he knew he had an Impostume in his Lungs, my friend (saith he) it is not fit time t busie your selfe about your nailes: The time was not long since when the greaest question was, whe∣ther the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, or the Bill of the Subjects right should be first moved in your House; the times are farre changed, the case much altered, before you judge of any matters now, or condemn others you cannot but look whether your selves be free, and what right you have: For if the main∣tenance of our Religion, and the Liberties of the Kingdome, be a ground of a quarrell betwixt too Nations that are so near∣ly joyned, and if it be judged so in that Honourable Court, we cannot see how you can condemn us and acquit your selves; For it was your glory to be the faithfull guardians of the Sub∣jects right, it cannot but blemish your reputation to be sound now the overthrowers of your Brethrens liberies. If all this motion of a warre with Scotland were truly perceived to be a conception of Spain or Rome, we do not doubt but for your
own interest you would be carefull to stragle this monster in the very first birth; but if you take it for a ready meane to ase your own distressed estate, and that by wronging us you can better your condition. And although we know the condct of your Councels had ever more honourable and honest grounds, yet let us take it as it may be propounded to you: can the be∣nefit that is offered to you countervail your losse: We need not bring it nearer, the example is but of yestedy, and cannot be out of your sight. All the Provinces and Prince of France, envyed the good estate of the Protestants, the priviledge of their Chambers, and the benfit of the Edicts they enjoyed, every one did outrunne aother to contribute to their uine, and to endeer themselves by so doing, to these that had the managing of all these affaires; with what successe, they know this day, and all that looks upon them, seeth what defence they have left themselves against the regiments of the guards. We writ not this as doubting your wisdome and circumspection in a businesse of this nature, that so neare concerns your selves, but since the malice of our adversaries hath prevailed so farre upon our gracious King, that he forgets the affliction of his peo∣ple, whiles he gives way unto their endlesse malice, who seeks by all meanes to cut asunder that knot of our obedience, wher∣by we are tyed in Conscience of our duty to his Majesty, to the observance of the Laws: and which is the sure Foundation of his Majesties greatnesse, and the Union of the Kingdomes, and which hath holden fast-against all the violence of time in so many ages past, and against the force of all adversaries what∣soever to th Royall Crown, the which the more we labour to preserve, and fence, the more they seek to undoe, and to put in the place therof a chaine of violence and force. We beseech you therefore, right honourable and dear Bre∣thren, now convened in both houses of Parliament, that accor∣ding to your place and sation, you will heare from our selves the true representation of our pressing grievances, and becaus a linke of that chain cannot but approach you also, if it take hold on us: we intreat you to divert in time our gracious King from runing headlong unto these violent courses, which can∣not but produce in the end lamentable effects both for Prince and People. And since we have just cause of feare, that what hath been begun without your consent, will also be followed contrary to your advise, although we think nothing more pro∣perly doth belong unto to the justice of that high Court then
o provide, that they who have been drawers of his Majesty t this action, so dangerous for himself, and so desperate for the Kingdomes should not passe away unquestioned and unpuni∣shed. And nothing could be further from our expectation then that the Councel of England should conclude a warre a∣gainst us, upon the relation of one man brought upon the stage of purpose to act that malicious part) without your consent wherby it is apparent, that these our adversaries have come to that height of insolencie, to let all the Subjects see that they have taken to themselves a liberty to throw down the Laws of the Kingdome, and laid a necessity upon us his Majesties own people, as it were to choose their leasure and attend untill they have power, and come and worke our overthrow by Sea and Land, and that without a warning going before: So now we understand that a restraint is put upon our Commis∣sioers; Some of them being put in the hands of Sheriffes, some of Justices of peace at London, Contrary to our expecta∣tion, for who expecting this would either have send or gone in that Commission: Contrary to the Law of Nations, for we are two divese Nations and Kingdomes, and they were sent from a Parliament promised and called by his Majesty, and warranted by his Majesty, to repaire to his presence, and to shew the reasons of our demands. Contrary to the very foun∣dation of our present Treaty, for a Committee was appointed legally by the authority of the Parliament, and necesarily, for keeping correspondence with our Commissioners, and to re∣ceive from them his Majesties answers (that we wonder any man should be so absurd as to suggest to his Majesty, that it is an unlawull or presumptuous Committee, or that they have taken upon them the govrnment of the Town of Edinburgh) And that for a long time past, no word or writ commeth from them, and we are put out of hope to heare from them here∣after That we can neither know whether there was any want in their propositions and reasons, or whether there was any thing to be supplyed by us for a ull satisfaction, and contrary to the deservings of our Commissioners: for nothing is pre∣tended to have escaped them which might have deserved this captivitie: And as for the present condition of safetie of the Earle of Southesk, and Sir Lewes Stewart at Edinburgh, it can be no true ground there of, his Majesty being fully informed by their own Letters, how that harmlesse accident of their sur∣prizall came on a suddain by the unexpected follie and rash∣nesse
of the Governour of the Castle, threatning presently upon their dispatch, to discharge all his Ordinance against the Town: And to ring (as he was pleased to speak) an uncouth peale of bells in their eares, and (we may truly adde) by their own precipitation, and too great haste to speed themselves to the Ports for escaping the common danger: The multitude not without their own grounds, conceived that the arresting of them might be a defence to themselves, or at least a delay of the Governours furie. But no sooner were they arrested by the People, but they were rescued by order from the Magi∣strate, and courteously used by such of the Nobilitie and Gen∣trie as were in the Town. Since that time no violence hath been done against them, but they have of their own accord, and for their own safetie stayed in the Town, with such libertie as they think meet to use to repair to the Streets, Kirk, Gardens, or whither they will. And in what equity can a particular tu∣mult of some ew Commons in one City, reflex upon the per∣ons of the Commissioners sent from the whole Parliament o the whole Nation. But at the writing hereof we are advertised, that the matter draweth a greater deep, and that the Lord Lowdoun is com∣mitted to the Towre, not upon the shallow pretext of safety to any arrested here, but upon his own guiltines, his hand and subscription being found at a Letter directed to the French King from certain Earles and Lords of Scotland, for imploring his assistance to their courses: This by our adversaries and such as had decreed our destruction before, is already exagge∣rat and raised to a mountaine, not onely to fall upon the Lord Lowdoun and others whose hands are found in it, but that all former friends and all indifferent persons may stumble at our Cause, as hereby evidenced to be nothing lesse forsooth then Religion: But the Honourable Houses of Parliament, who are acquainted with the designes and malice of our enemies, and to whom our innocencie in times past cannot altogether be unknown, are more grave and wise then upon the hearing or seeing of such a Letter, to precipitate in judgement against us and our Nation before we be heard. For their satisfacti∣on, and for vindicating our-selves, we are constrained against our hearts in this our Remonstrance, to remember and repre∣sent the words of that unexempled Proclamation given at York April 25. 1639. otherwise never to have been resented, but buried in silence, and in studied senselesnes, and which we doe
not attribute to the Majesty of our King, but to the base cruelty of our barbarous enemies. The words are thus: We are forced to have rcourse to a more harp and quick way to cure their obstinancy and rebellion by the sword of justice: And therfore in that case we do proclaime all such as shall reject this our free and gra∣tous pardon, and does not return before the said eight dayes, to that civill and dutifull obedience to be from thenceforth open Rebels and Traitours to us, our Crown and dignity, and declare all their lands and possessions, goods and geir to be forfeited to us, and our Crown, and that we shall dispose of their lands, possessions, goods and geir to our wel deserving Sub∣jects, Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others who shal adhere to us, & obey our just commands. And to this purpose we discharge all vassals and tennants to any rebels, from making paymnt to them of any of their rents, duties, or casualties, and require them to keep the same in their hands, the one haf whereof shall be kept for our use, the other halfe for themselves: promising also to the tennants of the said rebels, who shall leave their Misters, and assist us to the maintenance of our authority, good tearms of yeares in the estates they posssse, with the dimunition of the third at least, if not more, of the duties they pay, as we shall find them to de∣serve by their good service and ready obedience to us: And to the vas∣sls of such superiours as are rebels, that they shall become our immediat tennants and vassals, and hold their lands and possssins of us, and that for payment of the third part lesse duty then is contained in their pre∣sent Charters, and they prsently pay to their superiour, providing they adhere to us, and assist not their disloyall superiours, but leave them, and concurre with us for maintenance of our authority And if the superiour be loyall, and the vassals and tennants refuse this our Grace, and to adhere to us or to concurre with the said superiour in our serice, we declare it shall be leasume for the said superiour to expell the said vassals and tennants thus rebellious, forth of their lands and possessions. And what shall accesse to us by the forfeiture of their lands and posses∣ssions, we freely dspne and totally resigne it to the loyall superiour, promising to concurre and assist him for effectuating hereof. And fur∣ther we discharge all debtors who are addebted summes of money to any of the said rebels, to make payment to them of the summes of money addebted to them, or any part thereof: assuring our good Subjects, that they shall have retribution out of the same moneyes as we shall find them to deserve: and so forth as followeth. Although before this time we had heard from our Coun∣trey-men abroad, that other States, Princes and Nations did wonder much that their ears being filled with Informations against us, nothing had come from us to make known unto
hem ou cause, or our case and condition: yet sill hoping and patiently waiting for a graius answer to our many humbl supplications, we did abstaine. But our hopes being extingished by that unexpected Declaration, as we took our Swords in our hands at home for our just dfnce, so we were thinking to send some Informations and Petitions abroad, especially to the Frenc King, wherein, we trst, no word hath escaped us, that can ei∣ther procure the indignation of our owne King, or will be found contrary to the duty and loyalty of good Subiects. And that no lesse could have been said by any Nation, in so great extreamity: yet this was but an imperfect motion, which di∣ed in the bud amongst our selves, and never did rise to that ripenesse to be seen of others. When we were so sore threat∣ned, and when execuion was comming upon us by a terrible armie, it must be laid to our charge as a fault inexpiable and our Commisioners punished for it, that we dared so much as to intend to cry to others to interceed for us, when our own supplications could not be heard: Poore souls we must be bea∣tn, and neither resist, nor complain: It is therfore our earnest desire that every eye that seeth that innocent Letter, may with the same view look upon the Proclamation given out at that ime, and compare them together: And withall, we desire to be informed what we shall doe in the like exigence now when Armies are coming against us, if it be not lawfull for us both to cry to God and to men to help us, and to interceed with our King for us. That Letter was written before his Majesties coming to the Camp, and was not concealed by our Noble∣me, but made known to some of prime quality there: If there had been a purpose in he hearts of our enemies, that the Articles of pacification should have been observed, this Letter although it had been sent and all other quarrels of this kind, had been by a law of oblivion forbidden to appear. It could not have been a ground of calling the subcribers to quarrell them after the pacification, but the wicked Sycophant and de∣latour would have been found in the transgression, and made the sacrifice. And that there be no more doubt in the minde of any good man, we have here, upon our faith and honour, set down the very words of our instructions ubcribed at that time and yet exant which were not given, but were to be given to the Carrier and unto the which the Leter iself doth referre: To represent the uncient and strait league betwixt the two King∣mes of France, and Scoland, often renewed, and  invill
kept, for many hundreth of yeares, whereby both Nations, have fre∣quently upon the distresse of the one found the benefit of that mutuall amity, by ready succour and assistance of the other, which hath ver been crowned with successe, and acknowledged by interchange of Nationall kindnesse as the Chronicles of both Kingdomes, and diverse publick act extant in the Records doe testifie. To shew that our intentions are no wayes against Monarchiall go∣vernment, but that we are most loyally disposed toward our sacred So∣veraigne, whose person and authority we will maintain with our lives and fortunes: But that all our desires reaches no further then the pre∣servation of our Religion, and Liberty of Church and Kingdome, esta∣blished by the Laws and Constituions therof. That the calumnies vented against us by our enemies for their own ends make no impression, because they are most manifest untruths, ma∣liciously forged to stirre the envy and discontentment of neighbour Princes, Estates and Nations against us whera our whole thought, words, actions and proceedings are most legall and loyall, as the bearer can particularly instruct and make cleare at length. That seeing we have many times supplicat his Majesty, and have not prevailed, therfore to intreat the King of France, to interceede and meditate with our Soveraigne, to lay down his Armies, intended and raised against us, and to suffer this his ancient and native Kingdome to enjoy her Religion, and Liberties, in peace and freedome under his Majesties authority, albeit we be not diffident of Gods assistance when∣soever we shall be necessitate to our own defence, which is approven both by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations. Our enemies, who catch all pretexts against us, may have enough here wherewith to please themselves. But when tha grave and great Councell shall consider that the Letter was never sent, and nothing from France or at home shall ever be found that can prove the sending of it abroad, that it was in∣tended upon the hearing of so harsh a Proclamation, and be∣fore the pacification, wherein it ought to have been buried, and that it was accompanied with such Instructions, as noe but malice it selfe can censure: for no threats from England, non preparations in view, can cast us upon resolutions of intertain∣ing forraigne confoederations, in such sort as may set up a par∣tition wall betwixt the two Kingdomes; Therfore we trust they shall finde no more ground of pleasing our enemies, and of grieving us in this, then in our other proceedings, which we earnestly desire to be unpartially examined by them.
Now against this high and extreame insolencie of our ad∣versaries, which swelleth every day to a greater bignesse and exulceration, and is to breake out imperiously at their pleasure. Although in obedience to the Law of God and nature, we be thinking upon our preparations for safety and defence, and or obtaining our often presented humble and just desires, yet no∣thing but extreame necessity which hath no Law, shall enforce us to go beyond the bounds of petition and dfnce, and when that extreamities shall come (which God in his mercy to both Kingdomes prevent) we trust our carriage shall refute the san∣ders and reproaches of our enemies: that we are not seeking our selves and our own ends: but with the assistance o all in England, who tender their own happinesse and ours, to petitin his Majesty the more powerfully, for receiving right informa∣tion, and for submitting both all differences, and all those wick∣ed Counsellors, who have shaken he foundations of the Kirk, State, and the Kings Throne, unto the judgement and censure of a free Pariament, by which we hope the Gospell of Christ shall be inlarged, both the Kingdomes freed from danger, and our dread Soveraigne made more great and glorious, then any of his Predecessors, which, as it is the end, so it is the uneigned Prayers o us all. FINIS.
