A PROCLAMATION For the Observation of the Lords day, and for renewing a former Proclamation against Vitious, Debauched and Profane persons. CHARLES R. THe Kings most Excellent Majesty considering the Pious Zeal of His Predecessors, and this whole Church, since the time of the happy Reformation, to the due observance of the Lords day, called Sunday, beyond any other of the Reformed Churches abroad, as being a day to be separated from common uses, and set apart and appropriated for the Service of God; His Majesty therefore (whose charge under God, is to take care both of the Spiritual and Temporal State of His People) for prevention of prophanati∣ons of that Solemn day, which he fears may else be a growing evil, hath thought fit, with the Advice of His Privy Council, to publish this ensuing Proclamation: And to the end all His loving Subjects may take notice of the good Laws and Statutes provided for the Cele∣bration thereof, by frequenting Divine Service, doth hereby make known and Declare, That by the Statute made in the First year of the Reign of the late Queen Elizabeth, Entituled, There shall be Uniformity of Prayer and Administration of Sacraments, All persons, having no lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent, are required diligently to resort to their Parish-Church, Chappel, or usual place where Common-Prayer and the Service of God is usually Celebrated, upon every Sunday, and other days appointed to be kept as Holy-days, then and there to abide orderly and soberly during the time of Common-Prayer, Preaching, or other Service of God, upon pain (besides Ecclesiastical Censures) of forfeiting for every offence Twelve
pence to the use of the Poor of the Parish; And for the easie and speedy obtaining of the said Penalties, by the Statute made in the Third year of the Reign of His Majesties late Grandfather, King James, Entituled, An Act for the discovering and repressing of Popish Recusants, It is (amongst other things) Enacted, That for any the offences aforesaid, any one Iustice of the Peace where the party offending shall dwell, upon proof by Confession, or Oath of Witness, may give Warrant to the Churchwarden of that Parish, to Levy every such Forfeiture of Twelve pence, by Distress and Sale of the Offenders Goods. And that by the Statute made in the First year of the Reign of His Majesties late Father King Charles (of blessed memory) Entituled, There shall be no Assemblies for unlawful Pastimes on the Lords day, All meetings and Concourse of people out of their own Parishes for any Sports and Pastimes whatsoever, and all unlaw∣ful Exercises within their own Parishes on the said day, are Prohibited, upon several Pains and Penalties therein specified. And that by the Statute made in the Third year of the Reign of the laid late King Charles, Entituled, A Restraint of divers Abuses committed on the Lords day, All Carriers, Waggon-men, Car-men, Wayn-men, and Drovers, are Prohibited to Travel with their Horses, Waggons, Carts, Wayns and Cattel, and Butchers to Kill or Sell any Victuals on the said day, under several Penalties therein specified, to be Levied and Imployed as is therein directed; Which several Branches of the several Statutes aforesaid, His Maje∣sties Will and Pleasure is, and doth hereby Publish and Declare, shall be forthwith duely and Religious∣ly put in execution. And all His Majesties Subjects are to take notice, That by the Law, the resort∣ing to Divine Service, as is before mentioned, doth comprehend the intire day, and intire Service both Morning and Evening, and doth extend to all persons of whatsoever Opinion or Profession. And more∣over, His Majesty doth hereby strictly Enjoyn and Command, That no person or persons shall sit, or con∣tinue, or be permitted to sit or continue Tipling or Drinking in any Inn, Tavern, Ale-house or Victual∣ling-house, or sit idle, or play openly in the Streets, Church, Church-yards, or elsewhere, during the time of Divine Service or Sermon, on the Sunday; And that no person or persons shall on that day Proclaim, Keep, or resort unto any Fair or Market, or expose any Wares or Merchandizes to Sale, or use or exer∣cise any Work or Labour, of, or in his or their ordinary Trade or Calling (Except the Dressing or Sale of Victuals in any Inns, Victualling-houses, or Cooks Shops, for such as cannot be otherwise provided; and for sale of Milk before or after Divine Service) upon pain of His Majesties highest Displeasure, and such Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures as can or may be Inflicted upon the Offenders according to Law, and the neglect of His Majesties Royal Authority and Command. And His Majesty doth hereby Will, Require and Command all Mayors, Sheriffs, Iustices of the Peace, Bayliffs, Constables, and all other Officers and Ministers whatsoever, in all Counties Priviledged, and other places whatsoever within this Realm, That they and every of them in their several Offices and Places, do from time to time provide and see to the due execution of this His Pleasure and Royal Commandment, as they tender His Pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their utmost perils. And whereas His Majesty upon His happy Restaura∣tion, did publish His Royal Proclamation of the Thirtieth of May, 1660. against Vitious, Debauched and Profane persons; and by a subsequent Proclamation directed the same to be Read in all Churches and Chap∣pels in England and Wales; which having been well received and resented, and in some measure had, and, it is hoped, will yet have more of His Majesties wished effect amongst His people; And His Majesty conti∣nuing
a fervent desire to promote all means which tend to the suppression of Vice, and advancement of Vertue, hath therefore thought fit, by and with the Advice of His Privy Council, That the said Proclama∣tion shall be again Read as formerly; and doth hereby straitly Charge and Command, That each Minister in his respective Parish or Chappel within this Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Ber∣wick upon Tweed, shall once every Moneth, for the space of Six Moneths together next ensuing, Read in their respective Congregations the aforesaid Proclamation, and incite and stir up their respective Audi∣tors to observe the Duties therein enjoyned, and avoid the Vices therein forbidden. And His Majesty doth also hereby strictly Charge and Command, That every of the respective Ministers aforesaid, do care∣fully and effectually observe His Will and Pleasure herein, as they tender His Favour, and will avoid His Displeasure. And lastly, His Majesty doth hereby renew His former Command, and again Require all Mayors, Sheriffs, and Iustices of the Peace to be very vigilant and strict in discovering and punishing of such persons according to Law, as shall offend contrary to the said Proclamation. And lastly, His Majesties Pleasure is, and He doth hereby Charge and Command all Parsons, Vicars and Curates, That this present Proclamation be Read and Published together with the said other Proclamation against Vitious, Debauched and Profane persons, at the same time, in all Churches and Chappels. Given at the Court at Whitehall, the Two and twentieth day of August 1663. in the Fifteenth year of His Majesties Reign. God save the King.
