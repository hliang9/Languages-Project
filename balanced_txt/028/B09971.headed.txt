C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon surmounted by a crown EDINBURGH, The thirteenth day of August, one thousand six hundred and sixty three. FOrasmuch as it doth appear, that divers Ministers, who, by the Law, have no right to preach or remain in those Paroches which did belong to their Cure, do notwithstand∣ing presume to assemble His Majesties Subjects in Churches and elsewhere, to preach, administer the Sacraments, and to keep Conventicles and disorderly Meetings; and do go about to corrupt and disswade the people from that affection, duty, obedience and gratitude they owe to His Majesties Government, the Laws and Authority established, under which the Kingdom doth enjoy this great tranquility and the blessings thereof: As likewise, that many Subjects do countenance and joyn in these unlawfull Meetings, contrary to the Acts of Parliament prohibiting the same. Therefore, the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, in discharge of the Trust reposed in them, for preserving the publick Peace and the Laws in their Authority and Vigor, and that turbulent and dis-affected Ministers may not have such opportunity, as they have hitherto had, to continue their evil practices in seducing too many people into wayes of Schisme, Separation and Sedition, tending to the disquieting and overturning of the established Government of the State, as well as that of the Church; and in pursuance of what is recom∣mended by His Majesty and the Estates of Parliament, in the late Act of the tenth of July, intituled, Act against Separation and Disobedience to Ecclesiastical Authority, Do hereby command and charge all Ministers, who are or shall be found to preach seditiously against the Government of Church and State, who entered in or since the year, one thousand six hundred and fourty nine, and have not since obtained Presentations from their lawfull Patrons, and Collations and Admissions from their Ordinary, and have notwithstanding continued to preach or exercise any duty, proper to the Function of the Ministers, either at these Paroch Churches where they were Incumbents, or at any other place, House or family, to remove themselves, their families and goods belonging to them, within twenty dayes after publication hereof, out of these respective Paroches where they were In∣cumbents, and not to reside within twenty miles of the same, nor within six miles of Edinburgh or any Cathedral Church, or three miles of any Burgh Royal within this Kingdom; with certification, that if they fail to remove themselves, as said is, and to give exact obedience hereunto, (unless they have the permission of the Lords of Privy Council, or of the Bishop of the Diocess) they are to incur the penalties of the Laws against movers of sedition, and to be proceeded against with that strictness that is due to so great contempts of His Majesties Authority over Church and State. And do hereby inhibit and discharge all Heretors and Housholders in Burgh or Land, to give any presence or countenance to any one or more of these Ministers, removed by this Act, to preach or exercise any act of the office of a Minister; with certification, if they, after publication hereof, shall presume so to do, they are to be proceeded against according to Law. And being likewise infor∣med, that divers Ministers who were entered by lawfull Presentations before the year, one thousand six hun∣dred and fourty nine, and do still continue in the exercise of their Ministry, do yet forbear to attend Ecclesiasti∣call Meetings appointed by Authority, and to exercise Discipline in their Paroches, without giving any account of their Administrations, to the great detriment of the Order and Peace of the Church; Therefore, they com∣mand and charge all those Ministers to keep the diocesian Synods, and other Ecclesiasticall Meetings appointed by Authority; with certification, that if, after publication hereof, they fail so to do, and disobey the Acts of Par∣liament and Council made thereanent, they are to be proceeded against as contemners of His Majesties Autho∣rity. And Ordains these presents to be printed, and published at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needfull, that none pretend ignorance. Pet. Wedderburne, Cl. Sti. Concilii.
