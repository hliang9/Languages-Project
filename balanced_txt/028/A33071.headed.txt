TO THE Comte de SCHOMBERG. My Lord, I Address unto your Pie∣ty the ensuing Example of the hand of God up∣on the Impious, as I re∣ceived it from the mouth of a Sage, Learned and Devout Fa∣ther, who had had acquain∣tance with the good Simplicius, one of the principal Persons in the following History, and there∣fore the best acquainted with all
the particulars of it. If mischiefs are cured by their opposite remedies; if we save our selves by the contrary of that which destroys us, and if things are best set off by Comparison with their contraries, I questi∣on not but the Splendor of your Name, and the Glory of your Virtue, will here shine with the greatest lustre amongst the thick darknesses represented in the en∣suing Narrative. But God who draweth light from the midst of obscurity, does give us good instructions, by the horrour so naturally stamped on the front of Vice. Some Criticks who
shall run it over (as it often happens) without stopping at this Epistle, will presently judge that these are matters as unsit∣ing for my hand, as for your eyes, your Soul being as far remote from such Idea's, as the East from the West: But my senti∣ments are different, as I suppose yours will be, unless you be an Enemy to your own advantage; for who are fitter to beat down the most enormous vices, than those who are elevated to the highest pitch of Vertue? The opposing a Giant to David, was it not the means to aggrandize his Glory? What other rodbut
that of Moses could devour Ser∣pents? and what other strength then that of Sampson could tear a Lyon, subdue the Philistines, and unhinge and bear away the Gates of a City? 'tis for St. Peter to kill and eat unclean Beasts. The generous Julus in the great Roman Poet disdained to hunt the fearful Game, or to imploy himself in chasing or killing the timerous Deer; wild Boars and Bears are onely subjects worthy his pursuit. 'Tis the valour of an Enemy that raiseth the Glo∣ry of the Victor. Your deport∣ments so full of Honour and of Virtue, make you so terrible to
Vice, to suffer her to approach you otherwise then as subdued below your feet, and acknow∣ledging you Victorious against her strongest efforts. It is in this equipage that this relation does approach you; For as the Serpent Pithon was one of the most famous Trophies of Apol∣lo, who had pierced it with his Arrows, a fabulous inven∣tion whereby the Poets would denote that the rayes of the Sun do purifie all ordures; And as this Glorious planet does with∣out infection cast his rays upon a dunghil; so those of your con∣dition can glance upon the crimes
against which I declaim in the ensuing pages, without offence; and your Vertue shall serve me for a Lance and Buckler in my combat, and (I hope) my con∣quest, of these Monsters. The Ark which saved from the de∣luge the seed of the Ʋniverse, did receive the unclean beast without contracting any impu∣rity; so a firm and well tem∣per'd Soul looks down upon the insolence of Vice with a disdain∣ful Eye, and is so elevated as it were in the Highest regions of the Air, that their black vapours can never reach it: Judith offered to the Lord the
Equipage of Holofernes, Jo∣shuah accursed things of Acan, and Moses sacrificed to him the abominations of the Egyp∣tians; These reasons My Lord, have invited me to address this Tragical Narrative to Your Lordship, as to a Hercules, the chaser of mischief; nor is this without Example, the ancient Ethnicks dedicated Wolves to Mars, Eagles to Jupiter, Ly∣ons to Sol, Owls to Minerva, and Foxes to Mercury. And the Hebrews themselves sacri∣ficed Oxen and Goats to the great God of Israel, and Lord of Hosts: And to say truly, at
the feet of what more signal Virtue can such horrid impiety be thrown, and where can a more Heroick valour be found to purge Europe of those vi∣ces which render her more fer∣tile of Monsters then Africa. France, which hath seen you manage with so much care, fi∣delity and prudence her He was Trea∣surer of the Ar∣my, and Mr. of the Ordnance. powders of gold and salt peter which compose the Thunders and Lightnings, as well as Sinews of War, that Lewis the Just might reduce the rebellious Spi∣rits of his Subjects to some ap∣pearance of the Duty and Obe∣dience,
will witness to the World this verity: But since truth is as displeasing to you, when she tells you of your me∣rits, as she is to others when she reproacheth them with their unworthiness, I shall onely beg leave to hew from this fair Quarrey one stone to adore the Frontispiece of this Work, and bear this inscription, That you perhaps amongst all men living are onely he to whose sole cour∣tesie I may declare my self truly obliged, which renders me from the bottom of my Soul. My Lord, Your most Humble and most affectionate Servant, J. P. B. of Belley.

ALCIMUS AND VANNOZA. LIB. I. IN one of the most famous Cities of Italy (the name of which I conceal for certain important reasons) a Lord of great Quality, and an Illu∣strious house, which by many Genera∣tions had derived down to him the title
of Marquess, had two Sons besides Daughters, and as it ordinarily happens in great Families, the Children are de∣signed to several Vocations before they have years enough to make them fit to be judged of to what they are most proper; the younger of a more spright∣ly and active temper than the elder, was by the designation of earthly inte∣rest more than sound judgment, or a reasonable examen, designed for the Al∣tar, to suffer the Spiritual Circumcisi∣on of the Evangelical Eunuchs, and to have Dina for his Hire, that is, to be maintained at the expences of the Daughter of Jacob and Sion the Church: Thus were our two Brethren born like Lycurgus his two dogs, upon one cushi∣on, but destined to as different ways, and as far separated as Earth from Heaven. Happy younger Brother, if he had continued in the possession of Ma∣ry's portion! but it was afterwards ta∣ken from him as much against his will as it was at first imposed upon him. The Elder Brother was sent to the Acade∣my, there to learn the Exercises pro∣per for a Gentleman, that was to be bred to the Profession of Arms, to which
he was flexible enough, not that his disposition (which was rather lumpish than active) was much inclined to so robust an imployment, which besides a manly body required a stout and marti∣al Soul; but having as pliable and docile a temper as was requisite for a compli∣ance with the Authority and Com∣mands of his Parents, he rendered his will so agreeable to their desires, that his chief study was Obedience. But as it is impossible for the endeavours of Art to vanquish the inclinations of Na∣ture, or to give a hard and impregnable temper to that which is composed of a brittle clay, instead of growing hardy and vigorous amongst his exercises of Arms and Horsemanship, he daily grew more weak and unactive, so that to all appearance this Plant required a trans∣plantation to some other soil, I mean to another more agreeable course of life: But that was a thing which he might rather desire than hope for from his inflexible Parents, who more regard∣ing in him his Age than Inclination, his Elder Brotherhood more than his Natu∣ral temper and disposition, forced his Genius to bend to what they desired,
constraining him to pitch upon a course of life, which he accorded to with such reluctancy that it was more likely to shorten his days than to advance his re∣putation. Vain are their hopes, who think that they Can bring anothers will in all things theirs t'obey; Or bend anothers inclinations To suit designs, and humour all their passions. Our younger Brother, of a more vi∣gorous Body and active Spirit, was by a violent restraint upon them both, put into an Academy more reserved, more peaceable and more retired, which at first he could look upon no otherwise but as a Prison, but was forced to bend his neck under the yoke of a Superior Authority; a yoke too strong to be broken by the weakness of his tender years, in which his Parents had so great an ascendant over his youthful affecti∣ons: He was confined (as a sacrifice to the Church and Muses) to be educated amongst a Seminary of Jesuits: And as
there is no yoke so hard, no burthen so heavy, but Custom (which is another Nature) makes the one easie and the other light, time by continual and insensible drops hollowing by degrees the resi∣stance of his Spirit, at length gained such footing, that what was before con∣strained, now became voluntary, he making a Vertue of necessity, which is a harsh and imperious Mistress: Like the Horse, which at first being forced by traces to pace, is ready to fall at eve∣ry step, but once having learnt what they are designed, they go as nimbly as if they had no restraint upon their legs; so the Gally-slave, when once accustom∣ed to the bank and chain, the Oar which was before so insupportable, is at last easily managed. So he by little and little tempered and moderated the boil∣ings and emotions of his haughty cou∣rage, and as the Italian spirits are natu∣rally pliable to any form, and are like wax, susceptible of any impression, he so far moderated the contrariety of his Palate, that what was Physick before, now became Natural food; and being Cate∣chized there by his Tutors, which are the rarest in the World to range unruly
spirits to their terms of Duty, he be∣came of so sweet, humble, modest and tractable a temper, so fitted for the re∣ception of Learning, to which he had the accomplishment of an excellent Me∣mory, that all these added together ren∣dred him a youth of great expectation. His Reason too begun to come over to that Party, and assisted the design, by forming these considerations in his Fan∣cy, that his Parents better advised than himself, knew better the bent of his in∣clinations, and that aspiring to the Eccle∣siastick Scarlet (a colour whose splen∣dor does usually dazzle the eyes of those of that Nation) he might at last arrive to the highest Degree of Honour a∣mongst Men, and make a plus ultra to the Pillars of Hercules; and that it would be far more advantageous to him to be a rich Beneficiary than a poor Gentleman; that his Brother by the tyranny of Cu∣stome, inheriting all the Estate of his Ancestors, to keep up in him the splen∣dour of the Family, there remained nought to him but Alexander's portion, Hope: Finally, the bread of the Church seemed to him hearty and pleasing, de∣lighting his Palate with a Royal gusto.
He was not deceived in his conceits, for his Parents seeing him take the bridle in his teeth, resolving vigorously to pro∣ceed to an accomplishment in his Profes∣sion, did soon after obtain for him a Priory and Abby, besides a rich Pensi∣on; here see him in a high degree of opulency, and just upon the steps to further Preferment. The Religious of this great and holy Fraternity, under whose directions he sucked in Learning with his Letters, seeing him destined by the determinations of his Parents to an Ecclesiastick Profession, as well as by his own Inclinations, spared no care nor diligence for his instruction in Sci∣ences as well as Morality, fitting for a subject whose later season promised great fruits to the Church: For though these Devout and Learned Fathers have an Universal care without acceptation of Persons, to water diligently the young Plants committed to their charge, yet both by their Pious Inclination and Re∣ligious Institution, they have a nearer attention to those who are more parti∣cularly dedicated to the Service of the Altar, who must one day be the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth, and
the pilled rods with which the great Jacob will imprint his colours upon the Lambs of his Sheep-fold: So that not contented to instill into their Souls an ordinary and common Piety, they bring them by more lofty and elevated paths to the top of an exemplary Devotion; making them oftner frequent Spiritual exercises, and the holy Sacrament the Spiritual food, which nourisheth to a great growth in Vertue such as feed up∣on it: For them these holy Labourers in God's Vineyard have many other ways and holy industries, amongst whom the Congregations devoted to particu∣lar Servies, and under the especial pro∣tection of the Blessed Virgin, hold a high Rank, for there the least Devout are instigated to Devotion by the ex∣emplary Piety of those Professors, and the deadest coals take fire at their Cha∣rity, and flame with Celestial Love, in imitation of the great fervency that ap∣pears there: For there the works of Pi∣ety shine the more bright, the secreter they are kept, and their Piety and Cha∣rity on all occasions are ready with their flames to warm all that approach them. Our younger Brother remained
seven or eight years in this Seminary of Learning and Godliness, being every day more accomplisht than other, that it seemed he might justly say with David, The chiefest Good I seek t'obtain Of him who first did give me Breath, Is in his house to spend the same Until he call me thence by Death. This young Plant daily grew and spread so fast, that it gave great hope of proving at last a stately Tree, and one of the top branches of Lebanon. He became very expert in Humane Learn∣ing, and skilful in the Mathematicks; the knowledge of Philosophy had long since strengthned and confirmed his Judgment, and having saluted the Queen of Sciences, and his principal Mistress, Divinity, he had already been imployed six months in her service amongst an Ecclesiastick order, which by their con∣stitution were to be present in their Habits at the Celebrating Divine Ser∣vice, and known by the names of Mi∣nors; to this he was obliged, for the large Revenues he received from the
Church, where he had made himself sufficiently known by publick disputes in Philosophy, and had reaped a great commendation by reading Divinity in the Congregation of our Lady. The Fathers of the Company took great joy in his Education, receiving infinite sa∣tisfaction that they had sown their Do∣ctrine in so good a soil: he still pro∣ceeded from good to better, and the re∣gion of his spirit grew white towards a compleat Harvest, when on a suddain an impetuous whirlwind, an unexpected tempest swept away the fruits of so grand an expectation. His Elder Bro∣ther had for a great while quitted the Academy, for to learn the Arts of Horse∣manship, Fencing and Dancing require not so long a study as the Sciences; he remained in his Fathers house as Heir apparent, and led a life honest and mo∣dest enough, but soft and tender and ef∣feminate, according to the custom of great Persons, not only of that Nation but most others, as if idleness were an inheritance intailed upon Nobility. We have nothing to say of him, having no∣thing come to our knowledge pertinent to this History, only this, that though
this Tree brought not much Fruit, yet its Leaves being shaken with the winds of but few Passions, made little noise; thus quietly slipt away the few years which he passed upon Earth, till at last he paid his tribute to the Tomb, not as the Great Alexander, in the middle of his Course, but even in the first mount∣ing from his Orient, a lingring Fever ta∣king hold of this heavy Melancholy hu∣mour, which in a short time brought him quietly to his Grave: Some say that too violent exercise had shortned his days, and that if he had been destined to Letters and a reposed life, he might have lived longer; but how vain is it to descant upon the Decrees of Divine Providence? our weak reasons of that sort being like soft wax before the Sun. Proceed ye Parents in this course, and found the total of your hopes upon your Eldest, but consider how far different the designs of heaven are from terrestrial de∣terminations. He who on Earthly glories sets his eyes, And fixeth them on splendid vanities; Who in proud Palaces rules without fear Of the disasters that attend him there;
Here let him fix a while, and contemplate On the weak frailty of a humane state. To express the regrets and sorrows of his Parents, is a thing impossible; you may a little guess at them, by comparing them to those of a laborious Husband∣man, who after much toilsome labour, and wearisom expectation, sees an impe∣tuous Tempest destroy all the Fruits of his labour and the means of his subsi∣stence, just as it is ready to be reaped: for just as they were upon the design of placing richly and honourably in the World this Prop of their house, and re∣pository of their hopes, by matching him into a Family suitable to theirs in Wealth and Dignity, thereby to transmit their Name to posterity, they see themselves on a suddain deprived of that happiness which they had so ardently desired, so long expected, and so vainly hoped. But considering how vain it was to lament so irreparable a loss, they began to turn their eyes from him that was now nought but dust in the Grave, to the other who though alive was buried as to the World, thinking now to transplant the care of their Posterity to that onely
remaining soil, as if they had lived un∣der the old Mosaical Law, where the li∣ving Brother shall raise up seed to the dead, to retrieve his Name and Memo∣ry from the Tomb of oblivion. It is hard to tell you how the younger Bro∣ther received this news, for he found his soul so divided, and so moved on all sides by several passions, that he needed a strong clew of Reason to con∣duct him out of that Labyrinth: He saw himself called to a large Inheri∣tance, but having levelled his designs a quite contrary way, he was ill trou∣bled to change his intentions, seeing himself so far advanced into that Vo∣cation, which he had at first support∣ed with as great trouble and reluctancy as Simon the Cyrenean did the Cross of our Saviour, and was now more unwilling to part with it, and did passionately declare that his desire was to leave the dead to bury the dead, and pursue his former enterprize, to avoid the re∣proach of having laid his hand to the plough and then looked back, and be∣gun a building which he could not finish: But he had still been educated with so much subjection to his Imperious
Parents, who so rigorously exercised their power over him, that as he durst not gainsay them when they imbarked him into a profession so contrary to his inclination, no more durst he now thwart them when they would bring him in∣to another so contrary to the habits he had contracted amongst so many con∣trarieties. Austere and savage Parents, who make Tables of your Families and use your Children as you do your Table-men at Chess or Tables, place and displace them without regard to any thing but your temporal advan∣tage, learn not to violate the Will which God has created free, and upon whom he who hath formed the Soul hath re∣served to himself no constraint over it, but is contented to conduct it by instru∣ctions and inspirations. We will leave this Elder Brother with∣out troubling our selves with his Name, because falling Stars have none, but only those that continue fixed to their Spheres; and since it is not necessary to our Histo∣ry, let us leave him to the enjoyment of that Name which God had given him in a better life, and return to the now el∣dest, and only remaining Son Alcimus,
who is the chief subject of our ensuing Narrative. He expressed a thousand re∣grets to his Religious Fathers, to whom he was indebted for his Education, that he must now be forced to quit that habit which sate so easily upon his body after it had been unwillingly put on; and would far rather have chosen (had it been in his power) to be an abject servant in the House of God, than to possess at plea∣sure both Riches and Honour in the Ta∣bernacles of the World: But let him think or speak what he will, he has nei∣ther liberty to deliberate nor consult; and though a grave and Pious Father, who had a good while been his Tutor, remonstrated to his Parents the signal disasters which usually attend such chan∣ges, he was as little listened to or belie∣ved As fam'd Cassandra, who of old The ruine of proud Troy foretold; That flames of Lust which first did burn, At last would all to ashes turn. They contemned his admonitions with the scurrilous appellation of Cloister-Maxims; But Divine Truth is unchange∣able,
which has threatned to forsake those that abandon it, and that their Names shall be blotted out of Heaven, whose only care is to have them written upon Earth; who for their own broken Cisterns quit and forsake those of living water: Those who have once quitted the burning City of the World for Zoar, ought not to look back, for fear lest they become Pillars of Salt, a Spectacle to Passengers, and a fearful testimony of Divine Vengeance. Alcimus having quitted his former fet∣ters, which were now to him grown gol∣den ones, (for the Yoke of God has this property, that it every day grows more soft than other by the right application of the Oyl of Grace) and now brought into the liberty of a Child of the World, begun by degrees to efface his former impressions, and the Genius he had sucked in with his Milk; so true is that of the Poet, Though Nature be supprest by force, 'Twill still return t'its former course. So much easier is it to descend than as∣cend. His Fathers house was for him formed into an Academy, where in a
short time he learnt (so well did his active body suit his docil wit) the exer∣cises fitting for a Man that had changed the Cassock for a Corselet, the Book for a Sword. See here the Metamorphoses in∣cident to a Human state; He thought no more of the continuation of his daily de∣votion, as if the management of a Horse were of greater importance than a com∣munication with God: To quit his Ec∣clesiastical revenues was the least of his thoughts, for that fat morsel was too de∣licious to his taste, like Ruth's Kinsman, who was willing to redeem the estate but not to be troubled with the Woman; there are many willing to receive the benefice, few to discharge the office, though the one was designed only for a recompence for the other, and that they are or ought to be as inseparable as the shadow and the substance, the accessory and principal. He alledged that it would not be long e're by Marriage he should quite those revenues with his coelibate; but the truth is, he was wholly ruled by his Parents, whose design was he should keep them till they could light on some old Kinsman or ancient Friend on whom they might have them bestowed, by
whose hands they might one day be transmitted to the Children yet un∣born: See here the ordinary designs of those who say, Let th' heritage with us remain, Which only doth to God pertain. Not considering the Flames which are usually created by these Sacrilegious Morsels in the nests of such rapacious Eagles: finally he continued in this secu∣lar course of life to enjoy these Spiritual revenues, without the small Tribute of ever officiating in Divine Service: The learned Fathers who had cultivated his Spirit carefully so long as his Parents in∣tentions or his own inclinations design'd him for the Church, begun to treat him so sharply, and with such irresistible shocks to shake the Foundation of his conscience, as were enough to tear up this impiety by the Roots, which neverthe∣less like a young Tree shaken by the wind took faster footing, till he began to prove to them as a stranger & a Publican, and reject the practice of the maxims of true Christian Piety and Religion; for to speak truth, what is this but to halt
between two opinions? to swear by God and by Milcom? to joyn God with Baal, Christ with Belial, and light with darkness? to mix the Eagles feathers with those of the Dove? to make one Sacrifice to God and to Idols? to be at once cold and hot? to eat the fat of the Altar, and never officiate at it? Is not this I say to sow the Earth with two sorts of grain? to weave a piece of two stuffs: and to plough with an Oxe, and an Ass? They, who admitted not into their con∣gregations of Devotion any Souls of a mixt Metal, and consciences which would not endure the touch, did forthwith ex∣clude him, or rather Alcimus separated from them of his own accord, prodigally rejecting the substance of his Heavenly Father; not altogether so shamefully as the young Man in the Gospel, who fool∣ishly and sottishly wasted his Portion in a far Countrey; but yet very unworthily for a Man of his Condition, he turned out of the ways of Sion, no more frequent∣ing her solemnities. But the Proverb saith, there are no pots so ill but there is a cover to fit them; there are no con∣sciences so large for commission, but there are others big enough to fit them
with an absolution, there are enow that will praise to the wicked the desires of his Soul, and bless him in his iniquity; there are but too many guides that are as little judicious, as infinitly blind, and are not content to be so themselves unless they bring others into the same predi∣cament: There are flatterers enough, whose interest makes them speak the Language of slaves, and with smooth words bring those to sleep in an assured repose who have the greatest subject in the World to fear, to whom there is no∣thing more easie than to forge causes apparently sufficient for the unjust de∣teinure of the goods of the Altar: And an Erroneous conscience having once taken footing in the Soul, it is then rea∣dy to receive all Vice and wickedness, which being once rooted there, is as firm as the club in the hand of Hercules, it lyes not there, as a passenger, but in Garrison, ingarrisoned in an impenetra∣ble, impregnable fort: It is a great sin to call good evill, but a monstrous wick∣edness to call evil good, and to cloath Vice in Virtues livery; This is to mix Wormwood with Sugar, and poison with Honey, it is in one word to reverse
reason and the Laws, and under false appearances, to maintain the Sinner in his irregular desires. We ought not rash∣ly to judge of any thing: Who knows the secrets of God, or who has ever been his Counsellour? who has ever read in the great Book of destinies, or sounded the abyss of the Heart of Man? Who I say, but God, who knows our thoughts afar off, and who judgeth the ways and paths of all, to whom all things are na∣ked and open, and nothing close or se∣cret? But if we may give a conjecture to Humane actions and Earthly events, it is very probable, that the abuse of the Churches goods, apply'd to an use quite contrary to what they were designed for were the causes of the misfortunes of that Family; as the Prince of the Affy∣rians, who saw the Sentence of Con∣demnation written on the wall for im∣ploying the Sacred Vessels to prophane uses. However it were, our younger Brother was succeeding the Elder, went very pompously both in habit and atten∣dance, which was maintained by an al∣lowance out of his Fathers Patrimony added to his Church Revenues. Behold him here withdrawn from his former
innocency, and turned from the paths of his ancient conducters, and now put for the direction of his Soul into the hands of Persons who had no further care but of the Body. The wit of Man hath subtil∣ties and devices to colour over the worst of actions; Alcimus had still remaining a sweetness of Temper and shew of Piety, and not being able so soon to extin∣guish The Sacred warmth which in his Breast Had th' first and chiefest room posiest, Felt in himself some remainder of his former devotion, as a Cinder continues warm sometime after the extinction of the fire. He frequented the Church and Sacraments, and continued his former acts of Piety: briefly, he seemed to all that saw him the most sage and noble Cavalier in the whole City. O! how dan∣gerous are those remainders of Celestial Love; since they not only deceive o∣thers but seduce them in whom they re∣side, who thinking themselves the same that others believe and publish them to be, do thereupon continue sleeping in a Mortal Lethargy, for as the Poet sings,
To what end serve Temples and Vows, Injustice being lodg'd within? Who pious seems and vice allows Is guilty of the highest sin. He much frequented a holy and fa∣mous fraternity in a Monastery near his House, very eminent and much frequen∣ted, where he pitcht upon a Ghostly Fa∣ther that suted his desire, whether ac∣cording to God's own heart I refer it to him, but according to his own he seem∣ed to be very agreeable; for he confirm∣ed his conscience in his former Courses, and undertook to bail him from the ar∣rest of those Terrours which his former guides had seasonably imprinted in his Soul, which now seemed at last but the effects of scrupulous conceited old Men; by little and little the fear of God's Judg∣ments vanisht from his Soul, which cau∣sed his ways to be every day more defi∣led, and his heart more hardned; for as an ancient Father saith, It is the proper∣ty of Sin not speedily effaced by repen∣tance, by its heaviness to weigh a Man down to more, till the multiplication of weights at last press him to the abyss of
misery, the addition of sin, like an in∣creasing burthen growing at length in∣supportable; thus he passed some years, even sleeping in the multitude of riches, and splendour of abundance; daily as much increasing in exteriour accomplish∣ments befitting a Cavalier, as he impair∣ed in the inward ones of a Christian. He became a most admirable Horse-Man, or rather changed from a Man to a Horse, so delighting himself with that exercise, that if it be true that the Lover trans∣forms himself into the thing beloved, he loving nothing equal to this Animal, it might in some sort be said that he was himself become a Brute, as the Psalmist saith, like the Horse or Mule that have no understanding; for having no care but to aggrandise himself in riches and ho∣nour upon Earth, he so fixed his regards upon that point, that he had none left for Heaven, whose rules he daily trans∣gressed: But I think I may justly say by the way, that it seldome happens that those who quit God's service for Earthly considerations (how just and honest soe∣ver) and prosper long in their underta∣kings, for God loves not those who so slightly abandon Levi's Portion: Exam∣ples
are so frequent upon this Subject, that the very Stones would speak if Tongues and Pens should be silent; so that I conclude this grand prosperity to be this young Lords great misfortune: He was now grown brave, active, sprightly, and in the greatest worldly esteem imaginable; accounted valiant, handsome, generous, of noble deport∣ment, learned, rich, compleatly gen∣tile and agreeable, his conversation full of attractions, principally amongst Wo∣men, and which crowned all his other perfections, he was reputed very devout, and of a religious behaviour, so that there could not one point be found wherein he was not fully accomplisht: insomuch that every ones doors stood open to him, being welcome and desired in all com∣panies: Nothing was talk't of but Alci∣mus his admirable and commendable qualities, as the Miracle of Courtesie, Ge∣nerosity and Civility: his name passed through all mouths, who seemed by their infinite praises of him, all to con∣spire to elevate his Honour above the Clouds. But ordinarily the Apple that ripens fastest rots the soonest, and that which is most yellow is the most worm∣eaten,
the fairest outside hiding a worm within which in short time consumes it. The Vulgar who, as the wise Man saith, hath his eyes only in his head, and see∣ing a magnificent expence, pass no fur∣ther nor prie into the bottom from whence should proceed the substance that supplies it; and so they see but a ge∣nerous usage of them, mind not whether they were well or ill acquired; but the more sober sort, who content not them∣selves with the out-side of the bone, unless they come to feed upon the mar∣row, pierce with Lynx's eyes the secret∣est darkness, and sound the most hidden resorts which move the stately Ma∣chins which so dazzle the Eyes of the beholders; to those Alcimus his splen∣did accoutrements seemed composed of Copes and Chalices, shameful orna∣ments for a Man of Honour: But gain is sweet whencesoever it comes, said that base minded Emperour, who made the very excrements tributary, and threatned to impose a tax upon the Ele∣ments themselves. It is no novelty in the World to see several Men brave it at the expences of the Crucifix, who, one may justly say, do again daily cru∣cifie
the Son of God; selling him at a price as vile as that was precious which he paid for their redemption. Thus you see that all is not praise worthy which the World applauds. Happy is the Man, faith the Psalmist, that may be praised in God, and whose worthy commendati∣ons God will not suffer to be concealed; for to what serves the praise of all the World without that of Heaven? What advantage is it to be highly prized of all Men, and despised by the great Creator of all things? The favourites of Princes make little reckoning of the Courtiers envy or the Peoples hatred, provided they preserve their Masters Friendship, on which depends their welfare and pre∣ferment: I value not, saith St. Paul, the Judgment of Men, he that judgeth me is God; I should not be his faithful Ser∣vant if I should strive to please the world: I speak not this to detract from the Me∣rits of Alcimus, nor detain truth the pri∣soner of Injustice; but as a spot of Oil makes the greatest blemish in the most rich and curious stuff, even so, Greatness in him who does amiss The greatest aggravation is.
And this might justly appear to be a spot of Oyl upon white Sattin, it being the Oyl of the sacred Lamp which fully∣ed his conscience, till from it's former colour which exceeded the Milk or Snow in whiteness, it changed to a Ver∣million, deeper than the Carbuncle, by the abuse of Goods destined to a better purpose. This was not but that he was furnished (as we had said) with all re∣commendable qualities, and which is more (as a thing rare in one of his youth, and licentious course of life) he was ac∣counted to be very Chast, and by a good habit which he had contracted in the Seminary, he had a great Antipathy against that unclean vice; but his vani∣ty, splendidness of Habit, train of Ser∣vants, stately Horses, too much frequen∣ting the World, too much Gaming, and keeping loose Company, were the weights that remarkably weighed down the other Scale. He passed some time in this course of life, being so highly esteemed through all the City, that none but thought themselves happy to enjoy his Conversation, and no assembly could be compleat unless it were set off with his admired presence: he charmed the
Eyes of most of the Female Sex, as much as he excelled most of his own, and if their desires could have been effected, he had been the object of a great many af∣fections. Not a Mother but desired him for a Son-in-law, as much as her Daugh∣ter coveted him for a Husband: mean while he remained free amongst so ma∣ny Charms, no Engaging his affection upon any one object, leaving so many flames to waste themselves, which like coals by little and little dye, if the blast's of hope and conversation do not inliven them. He bore Milk and Honey upon his Tongue, (for having much learning he had yet more Art to express it, and it appeared more excellent, the more Ig∣norant the Auditors were) but under it he had none, for his discourses had lit∣tle coherence with his heart: his plea∣sure was to breed love in others, but none in himself, knowing that a little spark of this fire is quickly by degrees blown into a flame, and that the little pleasure that is reaped thence, is clogged with a thousand discontents: His Parents who desired nothing more than to see him honourably matcht, would have been glad that he could have pitcht up∣on
an object capable to restrain his wan∣dring affections, and to make his Neck pliable to the Yoke of marriage, which he shunned as much as was possible, be∣ing more enamoured of his liberty than of all the Beauties in the World, not considering what horrible wracks those Ships are subject to, who thus without either Compass or Ballast expose them∣selves to the treacherous rocks and winds, and dreadful waves: Thus plea∣santly did he pass his time, in the height of all Earthly delights, and Worldly pleasures, without considering that, Who highest stands should take most care, The falls of such still fatal are. Amongst his other vanities the chief∣est were to be richly habited, bravely mounted, and nobly attended, in so much that prancing through the streets, he seemed to be the chiefest ornament of them, attracted the eyes of all the inhabi∣tants: It is publickly known by all men that the Nobility of Italy, principally during the heats of Summer, do usually every Evening ride out to take the Air and make many turns and returns
through the streets, upon the gallant Italian Horses, or the stately Neapolitan Coursers, which may well be accounted the most excellent Animals upon Earth; this was Alcimus his chiefest delight. He was exceeding comely and of good grace and behaviour; but it was nothing to see him on foot or in a Hall, in compari∣son of the gallantry he shewed on Horse∣back, where, like a compleat Horse∣man, he performed all the Feats which the most expert in that Art had ever found out, he having a marvellous ex∣cellency that way: The Windows of the streets where he passed were crouded with as many Admirers as Spectators of his active motions, all giving him the vogue for the most compleat Horse-man living. All that offended him was, that those wicked and infamous Creatures to whom we give the too specious names of Which in French signi∣fies a Cour∣tier. Courtizans, desirous to please themselves with sight of him displeased him with the sight of them, for he took no delight to please them at that time, whom he scorned to think on at another; for which reason he shunned those streets which I should call infamous, if the win∣dows
abounded with none but Women of such boundless wickedness, the too frequent meeting of whom is the cause of great scandal amongst strangers, by their having so much countenance in this Country: This made him resolve to shun the Eyes of these Basilisks, by ma∣king his rounds in other less frequented streets. O how hard it is to escape mis∣fortunes destined to us; how short-sight∣ed is man into future Affairs and Occur∣rences: Thinking to avoid the rock of Scylla he plunged into the gulf of Charib∣dis, and is taken in a snare pitcht in the place where he fled for security: A street as large and spacious as fair and stately was now the Ordinary stage where, up∣on a proud Courser, he exercised all the lessons he had formerly Learnt, his grace and address at this exercise drawing peo∣ple thither from many quarters of the Town to behold him; Here by chance in a broad part of the street, he often used to make a stop, over against the Gate of a sumptuous House that stood there, which will prove the Theatre on which we shall see acted a great part of the en∣suing Tragedy; For the understanding of which we must know, that a young Dam∣sel
called Vannoza, had at a very tender Age been very unequally matcht with a man who seemed rather her Grand-fa∣ther then her Husband, which marriage was brought about as I shall tell you by and by. We shall present him to you under the name of Capoleon, who being rich, and well descended, had been mar∣ried at a season so young, as was enough to dispence with the most hasty from joyning themselves so soon in the yoke of marriage; and that by the disposal of his Parents, who to agree a suit in which a great part of their estate lay at stake, had Sollicited this marriage with a maid much older then himself, who had as great redundancy of years, lack of Beau∣ty, having features less apt to breed love than hatred: This Cup though finely gilded, was very bitter to Capoleon's tast, but the ascendant that his friends had o∣ver his affections, & the fear of ruining his fortune, & leading a miserable life under the afflictions of Poverty, & his Parents displeasure, made him do like those who shut their eyes & swallow a loathsom poti∣on, having more regard to the sweetness of Health, than the bitterness of the Medi∣cine, the loathsomeness of which begun
to appear still worse when he was come to the age to distinguish Beauty from De∣formity; then did the hook begin to pierce deep, which he had swallowed under so gilded a bait, but it was not enough that this Leah was blear-ey'd, but for a Crown to her other imper∣fections, she was Ill-natured, Churlish, Melancholy, and Proud, and would carry her self more like a Mother to a Son, then a Wife to a Husband, which redoubled Capoleon's vexation, who see∣ing himself from a Master become a Slave, finding as little kindness from her, as she deserved love from him, turn∣ed his regard from so disagreeable an Object, to others more pleasing; a folly scarce taken notice of in a Country where it is so frequent: This haughty ill tempered woman finding her self in this manner slighted by her Husband, was transported with such extremities of rage and jealousie, that her words were not able to express her resentments. What did she leave unsaid or undone, agitated by this frantick passion? she both said and did so much as essaying too far the patience of his young cou∣rage, she stirred up a passion in him
which proved little advantageous to her shoulders: this brought her to all the desperatest vows and menaces imagin∣able to take a severe Revenge either by Force or Treachery; So that in one word, never was a more distracted Fa∣mily or unhappy marriage since the first Sacred Institution of it: the Parents on both sides endeavoured a reconciliation, but they were Natives of a Country where as quarrel is like a malignant Ulcer, which may be healed outward∣ly, but will still have matter within to destroy the former endeavours of the Chirurgion, or though throughly heal∣ed, will leave a scarre which time can never efface: Capoleon did not so much fear her cruell fury, as her feigned affecti∣on, knowing that this Sex has some re∣semblance with those Creatures, who Flatter when they intend to bite, or of those which kick when one least distrust them: both stood upon their Guards, which often bred a mis-construction of what was never meant amiss, it being impossible for them to draw evenly in that Yoke, which was composed of such inequalities. Capoleon amongst the wo∣men past for a bad Husband, though all
men had just occasion to take his part against a wicked Wife: indeed both of them had been wronged by a marriage without espousals, I mean by the conjun∣ction of two Body's whose Souls were so divided, and humours so dis-joynted; for those marriages which are founded only upon interest, seldome come to a happy building; and now who could expect any Children from so notorious an An∣tipathy and so rare a Commerce. Final∣ly, after having continued some time in this Hell (for how can I better term this Fire-brand of division?) it pleased Hea∣ven to throw down his Gantlet of death to part the Combat, she first leaving the World who first entred into it, not without suspition of some indigestible Morcel, with which it was judged that Capoleon transferred the War into the Country of the Enemy, who so loudly threatned an invasion: But this suspition proved like a little misty vapour, which is no sooner exhaled but dissipated; for justice could discover nothing to Capo∣leon's prejudice, and the calumnies were buried soon after the body. But the most favourable opinion was, That her hard usage had abridged her Life, and
that the vexation to see her self despised by him whom she thought to be so obli∣ged to her, for the fortune she brought him, had been the chief weight that had prest her into her Coffin: And we must confess that Jealousie infuses a Poison into the heart, which is not so easily cu∣red by the remedy of reason, as by that of death; so that it may justly be apply∣ed to this passion, which the Poet appro∣priates to that of love, If time nor absence quench the heat, Cold Death alone can do the feat. Capoleon was Master of a joy at the breaking of this marriage knot, which he could never hope for at the tying of it, his present happiness equalling his for∣mer misfortune; So that his present ra∣vishing contentments, having escaped so Fatal a shipwrack, extracted from him a thousand protestations never to engage himself again upon a Sea, where he was so subject to the secret Treasons of the Rocks, and the open Hostilities of Storms and Tempests: but his Manners were so far from amending with his For∣tune that his freedome made him a per∣fect
Libertine, and he led such a course of life in his present opulency, which he injoyed by the death of her who had left him in the double possession of himself and her fortune, that might justly be said of him, which the Holy Scripture said of an execrable City, That his Ini∣quity proceeded from his abundance, and that the extremity of his bitterness (which is that of his vices) was the pro∣duct of is quietness and ease: he now went like a Son of Belial, with his head erected, being subject to no Yoke, if he may be said to be free from the Yoke, who is Slave to his Passions and inordi∣nate desires: It was far more easie to number the faults he was free from, than those into which he daily precipi∣tated himself; for his Soul was a Sea, a receptacle for all the Rivers of sensual pleasures, or rather a stinking Lake, re∣ceptive of all sorts of filth and impurity; and though his Sins merited a severe cha∣stisement from Heaven, yet the indul∣gence of the Soveraign bounty of him who is long-suffering and of great mer∣cy, was such towards him, that it might well be said that he indured not the troubles of other men, nor was subject
to the scourges of impious sinners; con∣trarily, all things succeeded prosperous∣ly to him, the gale of good fortune fill∣ed his Sail with a thousand delicious blasts, and the success of his Affairs did far surpass both his hopes and desires, but his wicked inclinations and impenitent heart despising the Treasures of Divine bounty, heaped up to him a Treasure of wrath against the day of vengeance, and the last retribution: But the wheels of Gods anger grind small, though they turn but slowly. Any Man's happiness to praise Before his Mortal race be run, Is crowning Generals with bayes E're the fields fought or Battle won. And since 'tis onely the end that Crowns the action, what good issue could be expected of a man who seemed only born to be a shame to mankind, and to trespass upon God's patience? Wherefore having long led a licentious life, and arrived to a well advanced Age, whether it were that his nature was changed by a long habit of vice, or that he sought a means for Repen∣tance,
or moved with a desire to trans∣mit his Estate to a lawful Heir, or that he thought there was no passage from the sin of uncleanness but through the gates of marriage, he resolved upon the same Vessel to venture another ship∣wrack, thereby shewing himself to be a man either of very little judgment, or born under a malignant Star for marri∣age; for at first being married too young to one that was old and deformed (two inseparable adjuncts) and which was jealous of him because he was young and lusty; He joyned himself the second time, being old and wrinck∣led, to a Lady that was very young and incomparably fair, of whom he became enamoured as soon as he saw her, whom he possessed as soon as he demanded, and of whom he became jealous as soon as he enjoyed her; this was the fair Vannoza, whom he purchased by an artifice which I am about to disco∣ver. She was born of Parents of very emi∣nent quality, and indeed more Eminent for Nobility of Blood than abundance of Riches: he saw and fell in Love with her in a great assembly, and presently
sounded her Parents, to whom he made the ordinary offer of amorous old Men, a great Joynture in recompence for a small portion; His proposition seemed so advantageous, that it dazled the Eyes of her avaritious Parents, so that accord∣ing to the cruel custome of the Coun∣trey, they made him a promise without making her acquainted, it being there the barbarous Method, (often attended with Evil consequences) for the Bride and Bride-groom not to see one another be∣fore the day of Marriage. And because Capoleon knew himself to be gray and wrinckled, though he still pretended to be very vigorous, and like the Plants in winter, who hide their vertue under the white snow, he was fearful least his eyes should strike into her breast a re∣medy against Love, rather then an in∣centive to it, and therefore communi∣cated this mistrust to the Parents, who (though they thought their authority strong enough to vanquish the aversion of their Daughter) did not mislike the expedient he propounded of Metamor∣phosing himself, accounting this fraud a lawful one, which redounded to the profit of the deceived; so that they took
part with the amorous doatard, in de∣ceiving their innocent Daughter, and to intice this harmless young Dove in∣to the snares. Capoleon without imploy∣ing Medea's arts, without casting his skin like the Snake, or beak with the Eagle, got so compleat and handsome a Perruque, that one would have thought (that had not seen him before) but that it was his natural hair: he trimmed his beard very curiously, and that lit∣tle that remained was so handsomly painted, that it would well have be∣come a chin of thirty years old: he so painted and plaistered his face, that there remained neither lines nor wrinckles, to betray the age which time had stampt upon it. This was not all, for he pitcht upon a young Gentleman of his own stature, whose garb and fa∣shion he imitated the best he could in this transformation; him he procured to appear in an assembly of Gentlemen, amongst which Vannoza and her Parents were: Him they made her believe to be her designed Husband; and she, who saw him but by the dim light and smoke of Tapers, and amongst a confused company, fancied him not to be very
disagreeable, for she who was now as ripe for Marriage as desirous of it, was willing to subscribe to her Parents in∣tentions, especially in the Marriage of a young and handsome Gentleman: Thus they made an interview, without any private entertainments, discourse or conversation; being but a meer fantome and illusion, upon which the poor young Lady was to fix the remainder of her years, not being undeceived till it was too late to remedy the mistake. Judge then whether this were an action becoming a Nation who account them∣selves (and perhaps not untruly except in these affairs) the most sage and pru∣dent in the world. At their return home, her Mother asked her amongst other discourse, how she approved her choice; she who had remarked no de∣fault in him that they had shown her, with a dissimulation proper to her sex, prudently concealed her satisfaction, protesting that she only saw with her Mothers eyes, and that suitable to a Daughter of her Birth and Education, she neither had nor ought to have a will dissonant from that of her Parents. That she would willingly accept of any
that she would willingly accept of any that was presented her from their hand, adding to this tender submission the most obliging expressions befitting such occasions: Thus was our tender young Hind hunted into the snare; she was no sooner promised but affianced to Capo∣leon, at the twilight of the evening, hidden under the shade of a feigned ar∣tifice which disguised his real imperfe∣ctions: The entertainment was so short, and the silence so deep, his voice never being elevated so far as to discover the deceit, that he, though an Esau, was taken for a Jacob, being deformed with age, he was thought to possess the beauties of youth; his hoary old age being taken for sprightly youthfulness by a prepossessed spirit. The Marriage was solemnized a few days after, but in the night time, where he appearing in sumptuous apparel, more fitting for a far younger man, and ornaments so gaudy as were as unfitting to his sex as age, passed by the out-side for a com∣pleat young Gallant: In sum, Vannoza thinking to have married a young Gentleman, wakened the next morn∣ing
the wife of an old one, who ha∣ving cast off his youth over night with his Peruque, appearing in the morn∣ing as Leah formerly did to Jacob. None but souls assailed with such surprizes, could imagine the greatness of these; Poor simple innocent! she thought it had been Marriage which so soon made young persons old; and trembling and fearful, she run to her glass, to see if wrinckles had not made as bold with her forehead as with her husbands, and whether her hairs were not become as white as her face was pale with fear, in which she thought she saw the image of death stamped, the fright had so dazled her eyes, till by little and little she begun to undeceive her self, the remembrance of her changing so lately her Virgin state, did also help to bring the blood into her face, and mixing the Roses again amongst the Lillies, and adding a lively colour to her cheeks, made her perceive that her flourishing beauty had not left her with her Virgi∣nity. The husband rallyed all his wit to charge her with excuses, her Parents also running to assist him, dazling the
eyes of this poor young Lady with the riches of her new mar∣ried One who desiring long life, lived so long that the Poets feigned he was turned into a Grashopper. Ov. Met. Tithon, repre∣senting to her the most advantageously they could the multitude of his wealth and opulency of his fortune, that this artifice was only intended for her good, and finally perswaded her she should be the most fortunate and happy Lady in the City. Thus was she brought from her first astonishment, in∣to a course of life which however disa∣greeable to her, ought to give all the content imaginable to Capoleon, and promised to recompence him with a free injoyment of those felicities which his former nuptials had denied him: In a word, this affair was conducted with such brevity and industry, that Capo∣leon was married before any such thing was talked or thought of; and now eve∣ry one begun to hope well of his future Conversation, and that the honourable bonds of Matrimony would tye him up from his former dishonourable actions. But whether a disordinate spirit carry inquietude along with it, as Devils do
their hell, or whether by misfortune he had conspired against his own happi∣ness, he who had first given all reasonable liberty to his Wife that could be de∣sired, permitting her with her Mo∣ther to see and injoy the Company of their ancient friends and acquain∣tance, and to frequent what places of devotion she pleased, being on a suddain inflamed with the fire of Jealousie, which is as fierce as that of Hell, he begun like Laban to Jacob, to change his coun∣tenance toward her, and to change those Sun-shiny days into obscure nights, he found himself to be old and deform∣ed, her young and beauteous; the per∣fections which he perceived in her, and the defaults which he remarked in him∣self, were the only faults of this young innocent; Nothing but administred fewel to this flame: If any one lookt upon her, it was with a lustful eye; if any one spoke to her prejudice, he be∣lieved it; or if they praised her, it pro∣ceeded from designs prejudicial to his honour: The very rays of the Sun were too familiar with her, and Zephyrus took too much liberty to sport about her breasts, the flies that chanced to pearch
upon her face kissed her, and the habits which she wore touched her too near∣ly. He thought her so weak that any thing was able to corrupt her: The thoughts that every one was covetous of this Gold, wrought in him a design of burying so desirable a Creature from all mens sight, and the light of the day: But had he brought about this design with better conduct, and had by little and little restrained his liberty, and Eclipsed this Star by degrees from the eyes of the World by some conden∣sed vapours which time should form into clouds; had he but gently accustom∣ed this Bird to the restraints of a Cage, this slave to the chain, perhaps in a Country where Captivity is so ordinary amongst Women, that it is even con∣verted into Nature, he had not so vio∣lently exasperated her spirit, and desire of escaping, and had pluckt up the root of many hard constructions and evil speeches against his unreasonable severity: But what is it but to expect fresh water from the Sea, for one to look for kind usage from a man blind∣ed with jealousie? is it not to demand reason of one that has lost it? to seek
for grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Those that say that this malady is an excess of Love, as the Fever is of natu∣ral heat, do therein confess that though it be a sort of Love it is but a sick one; and as a hot and burning Fever brings us even to the neighbourhood of death, so a hot and flaming jealousie is easily brought to consume the fewel of Love that feeds it: it turns the sweet and gentle heat into a Calenture, from whence proceed the sharpest effects of hatred, which will not stop short of an attempt upon the life, or at least of as precious liberty. Thus where this passion fixeth, being born of real love it does at last ruine it, as the moth eats the cloth in which it took its being. All Capoleon's desire was to preserve his Wife entirely to himself, and to perfect that design, he lodgeth her in a Chamber the fittest he could find out for a Prison, not considering that in confining the body he disjoyns the soul of affection from it, which should be the only guard to preserve it to him.
How this vain passion blinds fond man, To think restraints which thus con∣troll The actions of the body, can Confine the motions of the soul. This unexpected whirlwind seized our new-married innocent, who find∣ing her self not guilty, could almost have wisht her self criminal to be re∣venged for so unjust a cruelty; Judge then if Capoleon did not do himself a real injury to shun an imaginary one; having pitcht upon the surest way to make himself odious, by ingraffing this bitter slip of cruelty upon the large stock of his other deformities, which malicious age had planted in his face: The poor prisoner laments her condi∣tion, being earnestly desirous to under∣stand the cause of her condemnation, she would gladly know in what she had given an occasion of distrust, that she might clear her self of the accusation if false, or correct the fault if true: The Parents took this affront as hainously as the Daughter, but shewed not so
much resentment for fear of augment∣ing the punishment by provoking him, to the tyranny of whose power they had brought her to submit: But though the clouds may be so thick as to con∣ceal the Thunder-bolt from our sight, yet still they are easily penetrated by the Lightning, so that their discontents though dissembled, were discovered by Capoleon, who gave no other reason (barbarous as he was) but that he might dispose of his own as he pleased, and order and govern his Wife to his fan∣cy: As if Wives which were given for Companions, not Slaves or Servants to Men, could or ought to be guided by any other bridle then that of love and gentleness: But what one would press him to discover what cause she had gi∣ven him for so strict a confinement the force of truth compelled him to con∣fess that he had none, and that this re∣straint and imprisonment was not for any fault already committed, but to prevent those which the future bait of occasions and opportunities might pro∣duce, so that she must be forced to endure a present punishment for a future fault: Thus might Vannoza champ upon the
but, but her Groom would be sure to avoid the strokes of her heels, for this mistrust did so far provoke her, that she was not so much vexed at the loss of her liberty as that she could imagine no means to compass a revenge; but as winds inclosed in the bowels of the earth, do at last grow so inraged at their confinements as to shake whatever lies upon the surface; so her vexation me∣ditated none but dismal effects: In the mean time his testimony of her inno∣cence somewhat alleviated her griefs, and seeming to agree with him in the care of keeping her undefiled from the world, She keeps that anger close within her breast, Which tears her heart and robs her of her rest. Though she was lodged like a Queen in an apartment behind the house, in a Chamber excellently furnished, and in∣joying a most pleasant air, through the window of which she had the prospect of a pleasant Garden, deckt with all sorts of delightful flowers, yet still the
thoughts of a prison made it disagree∣able, and that liberty which she knew not the sweetness of in the possession, was now in the deprivation presented to her eyes, in such an equipage, and with such attractions as rendred it the most soveraign blessing of life. All the Images of the most excellent rarities, and the most signal persons she had ever seen, now presented themselves to her eyes, and repassed through her fan∣cy with such advantage, that the effect they made upon her spirit almost hurri∣ed her to desperation: sometimes ma∣king comparisons of the sweet conver∣sations of her dearest friends and com∣panions, with the heavy solitude which now environed her, where there was not so much as an echo to answer her complaints: This solitariness seemed so much the more insupportable, by recalling to her memory how short the days seemed which she used once to pass in the entertainment of divers witty comrades, and comparing them with the length of these, which she spent without any other company or comfort then that of her thoughts: It was with her as with Mills, which turning about
empty, fire themselves by their own motion: After this her imagination re∣presenting to her the most fair and a∣greeable objects which had formerly been represented to her view amongst the other Sex, and confronting the wrinckles, paleness, and deformities which age had drawn on the face of her husband, with the polisht foreheads, ver∣million cheeks, pleasant eyes and guil∣ded hairs, with the sweet and gentle be∣haviour, the inseparable companions of downy chins, O how intolerable did her old Capoleon appear! She a thou∣sand times repented of having suffered her self like a silly Lark, to be drawn into the net by the shining of a glass, this guilded ice, the lustre of fading riches. O how infinitely more plea∣sing seemed a merry contented poverty than a wretched abundance, clogged with discontents, but void of pleasure or satisfaction! And indeed he that de∣sires riches with so great a passion only to glut an insatiate appetite, is still the poorest man alive, and is not he that is contented and satisfied with a medio∣crity far richer than he, who like Tan∣talus is choaked with thirst and famisht
with hunger am ongst floods of water and plenty of pleasant fruits, or like Midas amidst his heaps of Gold and Treasures? So true is that of the Poet, The Covetous are always poor, He's only rich that craves no more. For who sees not that he that has such unreasonable desires is troubled with a Dropsie, that never suffers him to be satiated? he is only healthful and rich that is satisfied with the little which he hath. But Alcimus, as we have said before, surmounting in riches, pomp, behaviour, wit and gallantry, all those of his age and quality in the City, it is not to be questioned whether his form did not pleasingly possess the fancy of our fair Recluse, whose repose rendered her like a standing pool, in which the cir∣cle made by a stone thrown into it, does presently multiply its self to an infinite number; for this Idol adored by the eyes, and sigh'd for by the hearts of so many Females, but all in vain; took up an immoveable habitation in her heart, and this Samson so much beloved of so
many of the Children of Israel, quickly surprized the affections of this Dalilah; but though amongst other young La∣dies, she had suckt in this subtle poy∣son at the eyes; yet the impossibility of ever enjoying him in the sacred bonds of Marriage, like a heavy weight did lg the wings of her inconsiderate de∣sires, notwithstanding which With her own heart she nourished The Vultur which was in it bred; Languishing for a happiness Which she could ne're hope to possess. She judged rightly that this was no bird to be taken in a spider's net, and that her artifices would need great strength to hold him. But, said she, were I Mistress either of his affections or of some others, I would have recourse to it for the recovery of my lost liber∣ty: In my happy days I was so little concerned for others misfortunes that now there is none trouble themselves to to succour me in the multitude of my own. Thus without any to counsel or assist her, she wandered in a labyrinth of perturbations: Yet was she resolved
to leave no stone unturned to retrieve her liberty, not considering how she was likely to fall into a far worse Cap∣tivity, the slavery of sin, the most un∣fortunate and detestable servitude in the world, not caring so she could es∣cape a temporal punishment though she lanched out into an eternal one; not considering the many sad examples of Divine vengeance upon such impieties which Should teach the wicked to escape the rod, (By sound Repentance) of an angry God. We have said that amongst the exer∣cises in which Alcimus was most delight∣ed, that of managing a Horse was chief, and that prancing ordinarily through the streets, advantageously mounted and accoutred, and strutting in the pomp and gallantry of his habits, like the Peacock in the variety of his plumes, he passed often by Capoleon's house, this street pleasing him the most, being ve∣ry large and fair, and most commodi∣ous for his exercising his Horse in those
motions he had learnt him; and, as we have said, he did it with such rare dex∣terity that he never wanted abundance of beholders both in the streets and windows. Vannoza during her former liberty had often beheld him in these postures, through the bars and treillices of the windows, which by reason of their use are there called Jealousies; but upon the entry of her new course of life, being wholly taken up in the cold affection and conversation of her Hus∣band, this Idea had scarce any room left in her spirit, much less to take up a lodg∣ing there. Capoleon himself took a sin∣gular pleasure in seeing these gallan∣tries of this young Cavalier, and with excessive praises, raised his excellency and dexterity to the very clouds: He had shut up his Wife in a remote a∣partment, this spectacle, as most others, being suspected by him, and therefore reserved it only to his own sight. One evening as He and his Wife were taking the Air in the Garden, one of his Lacqueys came to tell him, that Al∣cimus was in the street at his usual ex∣ercise, and that upon a stately Neapo∣litan Courser he performed wonders, to
the admiration of all beholders. Capo∣leon on a suddain left his Wife, to wa∣tering the flowers with her tears, to di∣vert himself with this pleasing spectacle. Vannoza though she said nothing, thought never the less; she durst neither follow him nor ask leave to do so, know∣ing that to his suspicious brain this might bring some sinister ombrage of her fidelity, and therefore sitting very pensively down in a close Arbour, ba∣thing her self in tears, she discharged her self of part of her sorrows, in exhaling these following regrets, often interrup∣ted with deep sighs. To what has the rigorous influence of my unhappy stars reserved me? must I thus dye before death's approach, and like a criminal Vestal be buried alive? Certainly when one has by a bad deportment merited punishment, the rigour of the pain is some∣what moderated by the consideration of the justness of it, but to suffer an unjust punish∣ment, is the rudest essay can be made upon humane patience; and what patience so a∣bused would not turn to fury? Why should I bestow so much time on my complaints, and none upon my revenge? Dye then, un∣fortunate
Vannoza, and by one generous death cut off a thousand daily renewing and languishing ones, which every hour afflict thee. The cold and pale-faced Moon can∣not be more Icy than thy Husband, nor the shades more horrible than his presence; They deserve to live miserable that know not how to escape afflictions by a courageous death. But, must I dye then unrevenged? since revenge to the heart of a Woman a∣bused like me, is a pleasure far sweeter than life: Thus shall we set Furies upon our Cerberus, who shall sufficiently tor∣ment him, and make him experiment the extremities to which he hath reduced us. She had farther pursued this furious discourse, if the fear of being heard, joined to the multitude of her sighs, had not stopped the words that follow∣ed. But this interruption of her dis∣course gave more liberty to her thoughts, which came to nettle her spirit with the words which the Lacquey had spoke before her, so much to Alcimus his ad∣vantage; words which were oil to the flames of her desire: It is an inclinati∣on incident to humane nature, to desire
that most earnestly which is most strictly forbidden; And if this flame do seize so furiously on the green wood of man's spirit, what destruction will it make among the dry? In that of a Woman, who is more fiercely agitated the more unable she is to resist. She's quite averse if you desire, If you refuse she's all on fire. Thus said the Poet that best knew their disposition; But if she desire a thing which she wants power to obtain, then is it she strains the utmost of her subtilty, to invent crafts and artifices to compass her designs; and then God on∣ly knows what means she will not use to plain the way to her pretensions: The effects of Lightning which we so much admire, were never more subtile; for as that will melt the money with∣out touching the purse, and the sword without prejudicing the scabbard, so they will pass through bolted doors, and scale the walls of the greatest ob∣stacles, by a most subtile sort of penetra∣tion;
Can any hope to fetter thus A crafty female Proteus? The guards and bonds which her con∣fine, Will but help to aid her design. And this indeed was sufficient to whet her appetite, to call away Capo∣leon from her company to see the gallan∣tries of Alcimus, it did indeed prick forward her desire of taking her turn and leaving Capoleon's Company to en∣joy the sight of Alcimus her self: Thus she resolved to feed her eyes with this lovely object, like the inconsiderate fly that rashly approaching the candle, burns it self in it: There was over the apartment, whose walls bounded her liberty, a Garret in which she preten∣ded to be desirous of building a little Hermitage, there to make a retreat for the better contemplating on heavenly matters, like another Judith: she con∣sidered that from thence she might pass to the main part of the House which fronted the street, (and was kept from her approach) over the top of a Gal∣lery which joined to her apartment,
through which Gallery her husband usually came to her. His project suc∣ceeded to her design; so that having made a Cabinet there of boards, she made it be adorned and hung with Tapi∣stry and Pictures; so seeming to be ve∣ry devout, she used to shut her self in there, to attend more carefully the of∣fice of the pious Mary, though her heart bore the impressions of far worse actions than those of the busie Martha. Being retired into this remote place, she passed over the top of the Gallery we spoke of, into the Garret of the main body of the house which fronted to∣wards the street, where through the window she might easily see there all that passed to and fro; thus according to her desire she obtained the means of seeing the world. Amongst others, Al∣cimus failed not in the evening to come out to take the air, richly habited, no∣bly attended, and compleatly mounted, making his ordinary corvets and mana∣gery; and as he bore innocency in his spirit, so did he ingenuity in his looks; and though he was not altogether clear of all faults, yet that of a little vanity was the chief, and he never harboured
those unclean and vile thoughts which now seized the breast of this bird that thus peeped at him through her cage. If according to custome, he attracted the eyes of every one, he even ravisht and transported with admiration those of Vannoza; Cephalus never appeared so lovely to Aurora, Endymion to Diana, nor Hippolytus to Phaedra. To see and to desire was but the same; To her whose soul did now so fiercely flame. Alcimus whom she had so often before considered, did never seem to have half so many attractions; The Eastern regi∣ons have fewer pearls, the Spring fewer flowers, and the Sun fewer rays than she fancied him to have graces and ac∣complishments; and certainly if Envy with her squint eyes were constrained to confess the advantages which shined in this Cavalier, what must that of Love do? that penetrating eye, which will often forge imaginary beauties in ob∣jects where there are none; How did she blame the inconsideration of her eyes, which could formerly behold
such perfections with such an indifferen∣cy, and not give a true report to her heart of the rarities they now too late discovered. But what have I to do to divine, much less to trace upon this paper the divers thoughts and passions which swell'd her breast, the secret dis∣courses of her spirit; the irresolute de∣terminations proceeding from her words, thoughts, discourses and deter∣minations, which made a Chaos of con∣fused desires and extravagant projects in her imagination. With hope she fed her self in vain, Of what she saw no means t'obtain. These views and passages as innocent in the one as pernicious to the other, con∣tinued some days, these being drops of water which still made the Furnace flame more fiercely, and oil thrown upon the fire daily consumed her: It must needs be great because double, that of her new Love being augmented by that of the hatred she bore to the unjust rigours, and real deformities of her husband, and the furious appetite she had for a revenge for his outrages;
which at last brought her to this resolu∣tion: After the expence of many a Tear, Which daily flowed from her Eyes, If Heaven refuse her Plaints to hear, She'll call Hell to her Enterprize. But Heaven is too just to authorize such execrable Designs, as render the ensuing Lines more black, by the wick∣endess they relate, than the Ink that forms them, enough to strike a horror into Hell, to see Crimes invented by Fe∣male subtilty, which it can readily pu∣nish, but never invent. Such Crimes proceeding from unlawfull Love, To which Medea's would but slight ones prove. But for the present, what could she do? for to die every day a thousand torment∣ing deaths, in the sight of the Remedy that was only able to cure her, to die un∣revenged, and without complaining to him that is the cause; what is this but to put a Needle betwixt two Load-stones,
and cause that, contrary to Nature, he that she rejects in her Soul should possess her Body; and that he to whom her very Heart and Inclinations bend, can∣not be informed of her thoughts? So that she must either evaporate this wind, or suffer an Earth-quake to shake her ve∣ry Soul; she must either spring this Mine, or be buried in it; but the way must be to do it with that kind of Pow∣der which destroys without Report. Were I not desirous to find in the Vi∣per and Scorpion the Antidote against their own Poyson, I should here close up this rugged Clew I am about to follow; or if I continued in it, I should desire the Reader here to close his Eyes for fear of defiling them, with the reading the most execrable Actions which humane Inven∣tion could produce; but I hope, the great heavenly Physitian will assist me so artificially to compound my Medicine, that the Antidote may furmount the Poyson. For in pursuing this Discourse, I to my self propose this end,
That he who reads may feel remorse, From that, by which he learns t'offend. Thus the Rays of the Sun pass upon the Dung-hill without infection, and a sound Judgment through the knowledg of Evil, without receiving the least Tincture: I fear not but to draw Light from this Darkness, and sacred Fire (as the Children of Israel at their return from Babylon) out of a Pit, fill'd with Ordure. And who can blame for unfit or unprofitable the History of the Great Whore in the Apocalyps? Since God proposeth those Examples for us, by see∣ing the Punishments, to avoid the Crimes; and oft for notorious Offen∣ces, he useth extraordinary Punish∣ments; as in Thunder, the sound af∣frights all, but the Bolt lights but upon few. And God has also Commanded his Prophets to declare unto his People their Crimes and Offences, and spit their shameful Actions in their Faces; to Preach upon the Roofs what is practised in the Chambers; and to bring into the Evidence of Light, that which hath been acted in the Cover of Darkness:
And the Prophet has said to an Idola∣trous People, I will discover thy nakedness to the Nations. With this Intention I enter into the blackest Labyrinth ima∣ginable; and into a Recital more horri∣ble, than the Abomination of Desolation, the Crimes of which are as worthy of detestation, as of punishment. The End of the First Book.
ALCIMUS AND VANNOZA. LIB. II. IT cannot be denied, that those Crimes are greatest, in which God, who ought to be the Punisher, is made a Party; and when the Sinner endea∣vours to make him a Servant to Iniqui∣ty; when Godliness serves for a veil to
Impiety; this Wickedness may well be termed deplorable. 'Twas here that the detestable Vannoza began to warp her Web, and like the Silk-worm, digged her Tomb where she thought to build a House. She was now feignedly become extream devout, which infinitely plea∣sed her Husband, who not being able to judge but by the out-side, imagined that her Honour was now fenced with a dou∣ble Rampart, since the Exercises of De∣votion would serve for a pleasing en∣tertainment in her solitude, and that the fear and love of God taking up her thoughts, would breed in her a horrour of sin, and a detestation of all other than lawful affections, resembling the Mother of Pearl, which in the middle of the salt waves of the Sea, receives no other moisture than what proceeds from from the Dew. He could not refrain his praises of her, and extraordinary ap∣plauses, to testifie his joy to see her mix together her devotion towards God, and her duty towards him: See here a Hus∣band become a Preacher, a good Husband certainly, far more careful and curious of the Conscience of his fair Compani∣on, than of his own: Admirable Chari∣ty!
Capoleon became the Trumpet of his Wives Devotion; he thought her im∣ploy'd in her private Closet in the Gal∣lery, in the same Exercises with the Va∣liant Bethulian Widow; believing that her Contemplations were wholly upon Heavenly Objects, which were continu∣ally fixed upon an earthly one, whilst he managed his Horse in the Street: Vanno∣za seeing that her Train had taken sire, and that her Husband accounted her ve∣ry devout, ceased not to beat this Iron whilst it was hot, holding him in Dis∣courses of Piety and Heaven (though both as far distant from her heart, as the later is from the Earth) even unto Visions and Revelations, sometimes interming∣ling Sighs and Exclamations, with turn∣ing of her eyes almost in a feigned exta∣sie, speaking nothing but of hair-Cloaths, and Mortification, heaping up abun∣dance of Images, and Books of Devoti∣on, recounting pieces of Sermons, which she retained in her Memoty, and some Tracts of the Lives of Saints, which so ravished the spirit of the old Man, that he could not take her for less than a Saint, and termed her his Tutelary Angel, who inwardly accounted him her Guardian-Devil.
Devil. Nothing so much pleaseth the old Husband of a young Wife, as to see her piously inclined, imagining that she will there find such satisfactions of spirit, that she will never esteem those of the flesh. Thus Capoleon thought that this design in him of imprisoning his Wife, proceeded from Divine Inspiration, God having used that means to accomplish so good a Work. He begun to have more considence in her, and to testifie by some more than ordinary Caresses, that she should never want his affections in re∣compence of those she had fixed upon God; and that his love should still in∣crease towards her, as hers did towards Heaven. After this she made her pious retreats last somewhat longer; but this was more to watch the passage of him who was the light of her eyes, than to content her spirit with Celestial Rap∣tures. None in the House knew of this Artifice, and had her very smock known it, it had been in eminent danger of burn∣ing; for she knew how dangerous it would be to trust either to a Maid, or Lacquey, who were so many Spies and Sentinels kept in Pay by her Husband, to keep a strict watch on all her Actions.
And now what was she able to do, being alone confined, revengeful and amorous? She must use some means to escape from this perplexity, either through the win∣dow of Despair, or the door of Arti∣fice. A religious Artifice, that was the door of the Temple, which she thought to be specious, but was very fallacious; wherefore she resolved, To try all wayes that Wit or Art could yield, Before she to despair would quit the field. One day as she was Cajoling her aged Tithon, (according to the Custome of Women when they mean to deceive) re∣doubling her toyings and caresses, she protested to him, That Imprisonment in his company was the highest happiness she coveted on Earth; and so she enjoy∣ed but the sight of him, all others in the World were indifferent to her; so she might but enjoy this shadow of liberty to go to the Churches in the Company and Conduct of her Mother, to procure Indulgences, to frequent the Sacraments and Confessions, and to hear Sermons:
That all other Exercises besides these and her domestique ones were as contrary to her temper, as fire to water, she being no more concerned for the companies and conversations of the World, than if she had never seen nor known it: She knew so well to colour this just request with sweet and plausible words, and to accompany her dissimulation with such real tears, that Capoleon's heart was not so steely but to be softened by them; or had it been of stone, the falling of these streams had been enough to wear it: He took her inside to be as lovely as her out, and that both ways though clothed with flesh she was altogether Spiritual; and that though yet on Earth, she breathed nothing but what was Angelical: He thought that so holy a request could not be rejected without impiety; And that he could not without meriting some se∣vere Judgment from Heaven, resist the motions of the holy Spirit, and stop the progress of Grace in this holy Soul. The Proverb saith, That it is hard to find a trick to catch the old one, since their long experience has armed them against all devices; Yet this young Wit, refined by a Passion which inspires the most sim∣ple
with subtlety, needed not to go to School to the most ancient Crafts-Ma∣sters. Capoleon falls into the snare, and opening the door to a seeming Piety, he lets in the blackest mischiefs. Wine ta∣ken after Hemlock, is a good Antidote against its poyson, because its gentle heat refreshing the heart, tempers the mor∣tal coldness of the other: but when they are both swallowed together, there re∣mains no further remedy; for the one opening the pectoral veins, makes the deadly venom of the other a more easie entrance, and renders it so penetrating and active, that the vital heat is suddain∣ly extinguish't. In like manner the most puissant remedy after the poison of sin, is the supernatural heat of grace, (Grace which is the true enlivener of the spi∣rits) which does temper the natural fri∣gidity of the Soul; the Sacraments and other Divine Mysteries, are the Conduit-Pipes that convey this Divine Mercy from the Fountain of Salvation; but when one swallows them down mixed with the venome of Sin, then surely this iniquity is deplorable, which turns the Haven to a Whirl-pool, the Potion to a Poison.
Death into Sinners entring at this Gate, Hurries them headlong to a damned state. And this mischievous invention of Van∣noza was sufficient to hurry her to the brink of Perdition; for she thus obtained this favour of her husband, who thought this as great an act of prudence as of con∣descention, hereby stopping the mouths that were daily open to blame his former unreasonable Severity; and so thought he might safely put his honour under the conduct of the Conscience of so de∣vout a Wife. Vannoza's Parents adver∣tised of this good resolution, came to visit and thank Capoleon for it, and to congratulate with their Daughter there∣upon; She knew so well how to win her Mother's affection, who had for her a heart truly Maternal, that instead of being conducted by her, she brought her to accord to all that she desired. See here our Israelite under the rod of a Mo∣thers direction, delivered from the Ae∣gypt of her Prison, and the Captivity of her Pharaoh, to go feed upon the Manna of absolution, and the Word of God, in the desarts of Penitence: But her inten∣tion
was to pass that way into a Land of Promise that flowed with Milk and Ho∣ney far from Coelestial. To render her Stratagem more Compleat, she clothed her self the meanliest that was possible, and promised her husband to veil her face so diligently, that none but a Lynx his eyes should perceive it; all which he believed as Oracles: Her Mother astonisht to see her in this equipage, be∣came sorrowful for her fixing upon so strict a devotion, fearing it would end in a destructive Melancholy: Her Maids that followed her, fancied that they had an invisible Mistriss, and that she rather seemed a moving shadow, than a real sub∣stance. Capoleon who according to the custome of the Jealous, watch'd her with Argus eyes, could espy nothing but most devout and modest; and as he loved nothing more then the sight of her when she was at home, he now cherisht the thoughts of her, whil'st she was abroad. Thus did she dazzle the Eyes of all Men, and was so diligent a manager of her time, that in a few days she had learnt all the Jubiliees, the Stations, Fraternities, Feasts and Sermons that were in the whole City, and had all the Kalender by
heart. She was seen to go from one Church to another, and from Monastery to Monastery still at her Mothers heels, as if she had still continued an obedient young Daughter; which was a sight commended by all the beholders: Mean while her designs were so secret, That the most Curious Imagination would not in the least have suspected the smal∣lest part of them. All thought it was the Mother that conducted the Daugh∣ter; when indeed it was the Daughter was the Shepherdess, who though she came behind, drove her Leader whither she pleased; so desirous was this good Woman of the Spiritual Consolation of her beloved Daughter. One would have thought she had gone with violence and fervour to the Con∣quest of Heaven, when her Enterprizes were all fixed upon Earth; like Eagles, who when they tour aloft in the Air, have their thoughts still fix'd below to fall upon the first prey they can espy. Her veil concealed her from the sight of others, but hindered her not from the sight of divers objects which presented themselves to her sight, which above all desired to satiate its self with the sight of
Alcimus; This was the Butt of her pre∣tensions, her Indulgence and her Jubilee. Alas! She could see him sometimes in Churches, but he passed out as swift from her sight as lightning; or if he stood long enough for her to fix her Eyes upon him, this was to stir up a de∣vouring flame within her self, of which she could not make him feel the least spark, not being able to contrive a way to make him the least sign; for beside that, he neither thought of her nor of any of her Sex, much less could he fix his at∣tention on a Woman who had her face all covered with a veil; and besides, she had those watchful Eyes about her, who look't but for an opportunity of her mo∣ving her Veil never so little, to make re∣port of it to the jealous Ears of him, in whom a second Error would be far worse than the first. What troubles still destroy her peace! How her perplexities encrease! Her Soul's wrackt with inquietudes, And sorrows which do never cease. How plagues assault sinners in multitudes! We have said before that Alcimus his
thoughts were not also set upon Vani∣ties, but that he had some left for Hea∣ven, that he frequented the Church and Sacraments, and was very punctu∣al in his Devotions in a neighbouring Monastery. There was a certain Sunday in which an eminent Fraternity of the City caused a great Procession to be made, the solemnity and Indulgences of which drew a great many people thither to be partakers. Our feigned Saint, who was very zealous for gaining Par∣dons, failed not to be there with her Mother. Alcimus, whether by his good or evil Genius I know not, was drawn thither. It was in this occurrence that Vannoza invented a stratagem as horri∣ble as the end it was designed for was wicked. Alcimus in order to prepare himself for the holy Table, intending to examine his Conscience, and dis∣charge himself of the faults he should find there, went to make his confession at the feet of his ordinary Confessor, who was a Religious Father, and Bro∣ther of this Monastery, and who then discharged the Office of Confessor in that Solemnity: Vannoza whose head was filled with other designs then those
that seemed to bring her thither, consi∣dered attentively all his actions, re∣marking the place where he went to re∣ceive the benefit of Absolution, intend∣ing, like a crafty venomous Spider, there to pitch her net to trap this innocent fly: She goes a little while after as if de∣sirous of the like Medicine from the same holy Physician, there accusing her self of some little feigned crimes, which made her admired by this holy Per∣sonage, who judging of the Bird by her note, thought he had met a soul made up of purity and perfection: Thus did she cast dust, or rather seemingly divine rays in the eyes of this good man which dazled them so far as to take her for little less then a Saint: and as there is nothing of equal consolation to those that work in God's Vineyard, in this troublesome office, which of Confessors makes them Martyrs, as to meet amongst the thorns of a thousand iniquities, with which their ears are daily pestered, the roses of some beauteous souls, moistned with the dew of grace, and which ren∣der a sweet savour in Jesus Christ; this good Father blessed God, and all that was within him did praise his holy name,
that he had yet reserved to himself in the world such holy souls and faithful servants, who instead of bending the knee to Baal, and worshipping the calves of Bethel, did endeavour to work out their salvation with fear and trem∣bling. This crafty penitent finding by the good man's pious praises of heaven for the divine graces which he thought lodged in her Soul, that her dissembled holiness was rooted in his belief, having humbled her self the best she could, with the most artificial words she could in∣vent, like bladders puft full of wind, which bound the higher, the more for∣cibly they are thrown against the ground; so she continuing still a more zealous discourse, and painting her self with the colours of a Woman, most desirous to please God, and preserve her honour, sent out a flood of Croco∣dile-tears, mixt with a sigh which seemed to proceed from the bottom of her breast, which were followed with these following words; Alas! Father, said she, may I without offending God, discover to you some of the imperfections of my Neighbour: God knows that it is for no ill will I bear him,
for I desire him as much happiness as my self; it is only for the avoiding a grand disastre which hangs over his head, and which threatens no less then the loss of his life, and the ruine of my ho∣nour. Daughter, (answered the Confessor) you are not ignorant of the seal of Con∣fession, the same thing you think in your mind, you may as safely reveal here; for whatsoever is buried in the ears of Confessors, does never come to a resurrection; Nor can I imagine you can think me so ignorant of the grand importance of these holy secrets, which cannot be revealed without my losing both life and honour; nor so wicked as to outrage my conscience so infinite∣ly by so unworthy an action, upon which accounts you may assuredly con∣fide in my fidelity, and freely commit this secret to my trust, not distrusting the faithfulness to which all Laws both Divine and Humane oblige me: I am to the Soul what the Midwife is to the Bo∣dy, aiding it in the discharge of that weight, which presseth it down with an insupportable burthen: It belongs on∣ly to you to judge in what my interpo∣sition
may be serviceable to your con∣solation, and fear not but you have met in me a true Paternal affecti∣on. Thus spoke this good old Father, whose Dove-like innocency well suited his name, which was Simplicius, com∣forting a soul whom he thought to have great need of his assistance: Finally, this crafty female having thus by her artifices prepossest his spirit, spoke with a great earnestness to give the bet∣ter colour to her dissimulation, as fol∣loweth: Holy Father, it is not my distrust of your sufficiency, piety or fidelity, which causes me to speak these words, which I would more willingly have buried in a pro∣found silence, the cause of it is the violence I must do to my self to reveal the inconsi∣deration and imprudence (I had almost said the impudence) of another: Notwith∣standing which I will discover it, since you assure me there is no evil in laying open another's faults, provided it be not out of malice, or an intention to defame him: And moreover necessity constrains me to it, a ne∣cessity exempt from rules and laws of Ceremo∣ny.
Though, Father, you are dead to the World, and have few Concerns in Secular Companies and Conversations, yet do so much of them come under your knowledg, by the pra∣ctice of your Office, that you cannot but have heard of the name of Alcimus, which has so much advantage in fame above those of other Gentlemen of this City; and that you may the better remarque him, I am inform∣ed that he lives not far from your Monaste∣stery, and to point him out plainly with my finger, it is the young Gentleman, who came not long before me, to discharge (alas! I know not, whether as he ought) his Consci∣ence before you. Hereupon Simplicius told her, That he had not more particular knowledge of, nor intimate acquaintance with any one in the City than with him; that he was a great Benefactor to their Convent; that he was one of the fairest, most ju∣dicious and pious Souls that ever came under his acquaintance, nor did he ever know one of his Age more virtuous. Ah! Father, said this false Penitent, how easie it is to lye to men, but how hard to deceive God! (and in this, like Caiphas, she spoke truer than she intended.) Surely if his wickedness could increase so high as thus
to impose upon you, I take his case to be most deplorable, and it is impossible but that he must thereby draw upon himself some grand disastre. What is it you tell me, Daughter? said the amazed Simplicius, Can this man possibly be so like the Swan, as under an appearance of innocent whiteness, to con∣ceal the black feet of so horrid an impie∣ty, loosely abusing the Sacraments for a Cloak to his wickedness. I come not here, reply'd Vannoza, to search into the secrets of his Conscience, but only to discharge my own, by advising him by you, that he break off his search of a Woman, who being loyal and faithful to her Husband, cannot without breach of both be enjoyed by him. What! said Simplicius, Alcimus covet another man's Wife! O execrable Sacri∣ledge! O mighty God! where is thy Thunder? I have long governed the spi∣rit of this man, but have never either perceived, or heard such a thing of him; but trust this to me, and if he come not to see me speedily, I will go seek and find him out, and endeavour to wash his Soul with so scouring a Sope, as with God's assistance shall lick away this odious spot:
I feel zeal enough to dare to attempt, and hope I have influence enough upon him to perfect the plucking up so pernicious a root from his heart: And if you per∣mit me to remark the particulars to him, it will be from you by me, or rather from God by us both, that he will obtain the salvation of his Soul; for it is written, That he that retrieves his Brothers soul from the path of ruine, 'tis delivering his Soul from death, does at the same time save his own: and is it not an excellent way of working ones own salvation in that of another, and this properly belongs to the Religious, who to Monastique Fun∣ctions do joyn the Priestly. I do not only allow, but intreat you to do so, holy Father (said Vannoza) for to this sole end have I revealed it to you; and that you may see with what truth and sincerity I proceed in this Affair, know that I am the Wife of Seigneur Capoleon, a Gentleman well known in this Town: I tell you this, because the obscurity of this place, the Veil I have upon my face, and your Religious Order hinders me from being otherwise known to you than by word. I am the unhappy Woman, in whose face this rash inconsiderate young man hath found that which pleaseth him more
than it ought, or I desire. But there is no fire that is not accompanied with some smoke, and he does not only cast out some sparks, but so visible a flame, as is known and taken no∣tice of by all the Neighbourhood. Now you must know, Father, that Jealousie (is almost an inseparable Companion of old men, married to young wives) has so possest my Husbands heart, that excepting my walks to the Churches & places of Devotion, which yet is done in company of my Mother (which is the ancient Lady which you see here so near your Confessional) I am the rest of my time prisoner in a remote Apartment of the House, which only looks into the Garden, where I have no other entertainment, but that of Images, Books of Devotion, and my solitary thoughts; sufficiently happy in this retreat, in which I have the happiness of pleasing my Husband, and conversing with God, if I did not fear, that so many follies which Alcimus commits before all the world, and particularly in the sight of my Husband Capoleon, may force him to the extremity of laying an ambush for him, and take away his life in so unprovided a condition, as may render the hopes of his Salvation desperate; for to die in the unchaste pursuit of another's Wife, is but a crooked way to the eternity of
Glory: I have already discovered some of my Husbands menaces, and perceiv'd him to plot with his Servants and some Bravo's, against this young Gentleman, which cannot be executed without a probability of bringing Capoleon to destruction, Alcimus to Hell, and me into the slanderous mouths of detra∣cters, whose throat is an open sepulchre; where I should see my Honour unjustly bu∣ried. Judge then, Father, if I have not reason to advertise you of this mischief which hangs over the head of Alcimus, that he may get into Harbour, to avoid this Tem∣pest, and slip from the shot of this bended Bowe, and that by sorsaking so unjust a Passion, he may save himself from so emi∣nent a destruction. In truth Daughter, reply'd Simplici∣us, you include many vertuous acts in one; for besides the testimony of your honesty, and your inviolable fidelity to your Spouse, you use a grand and sig∣nal prudence, to prevent the many slan∣ders which might succeed so pernicious a design; and principally you manifest an extream charity towards this wretched offender, who does justly merit to perish in his iniquity: But we ought still to hope well of Divine mercy and a sin∣ner's
Conversion, above all when the iniquity is but in its Infancy, whiles the young man is yet within the gate, or Jairus his Tabitha within the house, without attending Lazarus his four days corruption, till an inveterate habit have rendred him incurable. But yet, con∣tinued he, may I not yet be further in∣structed (that I may more clearly carry my self in this affair) of some particulars of the unhappy search of this young in∣solent? I question not but that against the constancy of your honesty, his sighs and tears are but winds and waves spent upon a rock: but how far has his vanity proceeded? has your Husband yet per∣ceived it? or is he yet come to open words, threats, and bravadoes, or only to small suspicions. I thank God, said she, he is not yet come to the extremities you first specified, but he is upon the essay you last mentioned; for Alci∣mus his pursuits are so evident, that none, except blind, but must needs remark him; for every evening, under pretences of taking the Air, and managing his Horse (in which, and in his Attendance he has an extream vanity) he has pickt out our Street, which is fair and spacious, for the Theatre of his Ex∣ercises
(shall I say) or Follies, and this to endeavour to draw me to the window, as ma∣ny other inconsiderate young ones, there to see my face; from the Ice and coldness of which towards him, he hath raised such a flame, as rages with so much more puissance, as it finds in him less resistance; for this Passion is so voluntary an evil, that it tor∣ments us no longer than we please, and so no longer than we give it the Sovereignty of our Hearts. In the beginning of these pas∣sages, when I had the liberty to go into what parts of the House I pleased, I became one of his beholders, and thereby the innocent cause of his Passion, without giving him any subject for it. Capoleon himself, who took great pleasure in seeing him in these po∣stures, and who in his time has been a good Horseman, used to bring me to see him; but since his Jealousie has confin'd me to a quar∣ter of the House far remote from the street, 'tis in vain for Alcimus to make his pas∣sings to and fro; for I am wholly eclipsed from his eyes: But he is of the number of those foolish Lovers, who content themselves with the sight of those Wells, which inclose the Object of their flames; like Elephants, who not daring to swim in a water which has not depth enough to support them, wash
themselves by walking along the edge of a River, where they are oft either taken or slain: And I am so afraid, lest this incon∣siderate Bird, if it take not heed, be shot by an Arrow feathered from its own wing, or catcht in lime-twigs of its own pitching; for as every man is the Artificer of his own good, so is he of his own bad fortune: I hear the Winds rise, the Waves roll, and the Tempest approach; my Husband, to whom all things bring cause of suspition, yet knows that I am not at all desirous of the sight of this Cavalier, and is hugely offended that these passages are a common Table-talk a∣mongst the Neighbourhood, amongst whom the murmur runs, that he makes all these turns for a Bird that Capoleon keeps enca∣ged, meaning me. May it therefore please you, most holy Father, to do this charitable office to him, my Husband, and my self, to prevent so great a mischief and scandal, by advertising him for the future to leave off this unprofitable pursuit, which can neither be advantageous nor honourable, except he desire to be continually in danger; till per∣haps at last, amongst these turns and passa∣ges, he may light on one, he neither sought nor thought of, which is that which leads from life to death. I being so close shut up
as I am, could not have opportunity to give him any advice of this by any of my Ser∣vants, lest they should suspect betwixt us some secret intelligence, and that my Hus∣band, who sets them as so many Spies about me, should not have a pretext to treat me more rigorously; and as I was just going to trust this important Secret to this ancient Lady you see here, (who though my Mo∣ther, is still a woman, and my own frailty tells me, how bad a repository our Sex is for such privacies) God inspired me just upon that instant to come to your holy Fa∣therhood, having seen him part from you; so that for the future, I shall rely upon your prudence and charity, to give a remedy to these threatning Misfortunes. Daughter (reply'd the good Father Sim∣plicius) since you not only permit, but enjoyn me to open my mouth upon this Subject, for the good and safety of so many Souls, I shall willingly obey you in so just an occasion, which concerns the Glory and Service of God, whom I serve, therefore rely upon me, and I will apply my utmost diligence to cut the thread of his folly; be you only con∣stant, devout, and faithful, and take this Maxime from me, That the best and
greatest Policy and Invention, is to keep a good Conscience, and to walk upright∣ly before God; have a good courage and confidence in the Divine Bounty, and fear not but truth and purity will be your Safe-guard. Whereupon having gi∣ven her his blessing, he dismiss'd her in peace. Imagine with your self, whether this subtle woman might not well be com∣pared to a Rower that turns his Bark to the Port he aims at; whether to all out∣ward appearance, her discarding of Al∣cimus, were not the ruine of her De∣sign. But infinite are the Inventions of the heart, when it is infected with the Poyson of the old Serpent, who was a Murtherer from the beginning, and by whom Sin entred into the World, with Death for its attendant. None make up directly and openly to Iniquity, there must be always some Colour or Leaves to hide it, or else it would appear too openly; it has always a specious out-side, and though the in-side of the Coin be plain brass, it will be sure to be hand∣somly plated over. Vannoza being part∣ed from Father Simplicius, told her Mo∣ther, that she had found so much edifi∣cation
in his Remonstrances, and such profit in his Instructions, that for the fu∣ture he should be her only Confessor; which pleased her Mother very much, desi∣ring nothing more than the contentment of her Daughter, who in those words only sowed the Seed of a speedy return, to know whether that Match which she had lighted, had given fire to the Train of her wicked Intentions. Mean while, the good Religious Father, hurried on by his zeal, without attending Alcimus his coming, whose loss he apprehended, went to visit him in his house, as he did at other times before, as well in quality of a Neighbour, as to cultivate the be∣nevolence of so good a Benefactor to the Fraternity, and to mix a little prudence with his plainness, knowing by common Opinion as well as Experience, that all the words of women are not Oracles: he made private inquiries if it were true that this Gentleman went so in the eve∣ning, prancing through the street where Capoleon's house was; which he found to be very true; and which was more (as every thing gives cause of suspition in this jealous Nation) that he was much spoken of for his gallantry and brave Be∣haviour.
Hence the good man conjectu∣red, that Vannoza's report was but too true. Therefore being with Alcimus, after many Discourses and ordinary Entertainments, he fell, as if by acci∣dent, upon the Discourse of Serenades and Gallantries in the Streets, which this young Gentleman ingenuously ac∣knowledged; and withal told him, That to avoid the eyes of so many infamous Courtizans as throng'd the Windows to behold him, he shunned as diligently as was possible the places affected with that accursed Race, for that end passing through the more remote and less fre∣quented ones; confessing further, the pleasure he took in this exercise, in which he drew the Opinions of all Beholders to reckon him for excellent. But Father, said he, do you disapprove of it as sinful? or can this kind of vain∣glory, (for that is the worst title it can me∣rit) amount to a heinous offence? For to be seen, taken notice of, praised, esteemed and admired, is a thing very ordinary amongst Academies, which pleasing applause does undeniably tickle the heart through the ear.
Then Simplicius thinking he had brought Alcimus to the point desired, begun presently to tell him, That this passing through the streets, whe∣ther on foot or horseback, was in it self a thing indifferent; but that in∣different actions took the tincture ei∣ther of good or evil form the designs and determinations which were intermixt with them; for there is no∣thing so good but may be corrupted by a malignant spirit, and from which, like a spider, it may not suck poison. Nor any thing so evil from which a well-disposed spirit may not draw some advantage. That feasts, ban∣quets, assemblies, dancing, honest plays and recreations, habits, and such like, were of this nature, and were neither to be praised or condemned, but according to the usage or abuse, the mo∣deration or excess of those that use them: But that humane nature and inclinations were so inclined and bent towards the vanities of youth, that as if our very touch were infectious, we are apt to corrupt the very best things by handling, much more indifferent ones. So wine and meats, which are
given to sustain the body, serve for objects of daintiness to one, drunken∣ness to another, and gluttony to o∣thers, and amongst ssemblies to bind the amity of the company, and con∣firm their friendship, which conserve the union of all Societies: Many others are led by irregular affections, from whence arise many scandalous actions: And further, that these passings and repassings through the streets with so great attendance, such pomp, splendor and sumptuousness could not well be void, not only of excess, but of many dangers of taking or being caught, the world is every way so full of snares: For as the Peacocks in setting up their plumes, do thereby excite the females to pleasure, so men when they make so splendid an appearance, are the cause of many inconsiderable Womens sinning in wanton thoughts or un∣chaste desires: and what do you think (continued he) men are apt to say when they see a young Gallant, handsom, brave, well habited, and advantage∣ously mounted, making turns and re∣turns in a street, but that he has either love or design upon some object there;
whence proceed murmures, curious inquiries, hard speeches and scandals: And if the object be unlawful to be desired, then the Woman is persecu∣ted with infamy, the Husband rackt with jealousie, till he breathe out no∣thing but fury and revenge; for how can he otherwise contain himself, who sees his wife courted before his face, and himself thereby subjected to the reproaches of the world, and laugh∣ter of the people: From this source spring great and dangerous accidents, which it is more easie to avoid then remedy, when arrived. And afterwards taking his oppor∣tunity he proceeded thus, It is not without some cause, Seigneur Alcimus, that I make you this discourse, for I have from good hands re∣ceived a bad report of you, and I assure you I could never have thought or belie∣ved, that a soul so seemingly fair as yours, would by the easie way of deceiving men, pass so unworthily to the dangerous one of offending God: but deceive not your self, for none can mock God with impunity, if he withold his vengeance, it is but to re∣double his stroke. I should be a traitor
not only to the obligations I have to your amity and to the diligent care I ought to have of your safety and salvation, and my own, but also to the Master whom I serve, if I did not advertise and admo∣nish you of your danger of both temporal and eternal destruction: the sword of di∣vine vengeance hangs over your head, and like that of Damocles, but in a slen∣der thread: Both God and Man have bent their bows, and made ready both ar∣rows of fire and death against you, ex∣cept you avoid the blow by repentance, and arm your self by a serious penitence: all things conspire against you whilest you continue in your wickedness, unless you turn from your evil way, I cannot say within forty days, which was the space that Jonas allotted Niniveh, but within a far shorter term: Think no longer to impose upon me by feigned confessions, for God will one day lay open your dissi∣mulations and my intentions, when he shall discover what is hidden in the heart, and shall open the secrets of dark∣ness. If ever man were surprized or asto∣nish'd, it was Alcimus, who seeing his innocence burthened with a Crime
which the other did not name, nor he imagine, did at once change colour an hundred times; and these alterations, caused by his sincerity and ingenuity, were by Simplicius, who stedfastly re∣garded him, taken for the effects of guilt, and remorse of Conscience; and there∣fore said, Take Courage, Seigneur Alci∣mus, all will be well, that skarlet of your blushes does elevate my hopes, and makes me attend your ingenuous and free Confes∣sion. Alcimus, who felt his Conscience clogged with nothing but the deteinure of his Church-Revenues, of which we have amply treated in the beginning of this Narrative, did like those that are struck, presently lay his hand on the bruised spot, where he felt the pain. And after calling to mind how he had often conferred about this Affair with this good Father, who had found him certain Expedients, if not to remove the sting from his Conscience, yet at least to lay the pain asleep, till he had found an Expedient to assure these Bene∣fices to his Family. My good Father (said he) as amongst the Bees, she that makes the Honey stings most severely, so now this As∣sault
is the more insupportable from that mouth which hath hitherto distil∣led unto me nothing but sweets and Consolations; God is my witness, that I have never concealed any thing from you, at the Tribunal where accusing ones self is the best excuse; and if you have not known any thing of me there, it must be because I am ignorant of it my self. It is true, I dare not reckon my self for an extraordinary good man; for if I should justifie my self, my own mouth would condemn me; and if I have offended God, and sinned against him, it is, that he may be ju∣stified in his saying, and what he judg∣eth: I confess, I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my Mother conceive me; but yet I have ever loved the truth, by and through which I have accused my self of the most hidden faults I could remarque, and without fraud or mincing, I have freely disco∣ver'd my secrets to you; but if God have by some extraordinary means re∣vealed any to you, that have slipt out of my remembrance, tell it me, and reprove me in the spirit of meekness and gentleness, and I am ready to a∣mend
it; for I every day heartily be∣seech God (with the Royal Prophet) to cleanse me from my secret faults, and from those sins which I may be guilty of, by the participation of those of o∣thers. At this present, I can boldly say, that nothing lies heavy on my heart, but the enjoyment of these Church Benefices, without intention of being a Church-man; but they be∣ing of that nature, that they may be possessed by a Secular person, and I be∣ing unmarried, and not able to quit them absolutely, without breach of that respect which I owe to my Parents, I think I hold them by no such unjust Title; add to this the many consolati∣ons I have received from you, when I have revealed to you the causes of my Scruples; and yet I am ready at the disposition of those from whom I hold what I have, to do any thing that shall be adjudged fitting by any sober and grave Persons. Simplicius thinking that Alcimus would dextrously thus have warded the blow, and changed his purpose, to avoid answering to that which he thought he had plainly enough proposed.
No, no, said he, Seigneur Alcimus, you must not thus think to escape me, I have fig-leaves in my hands to prevent the gli∣dings of the Snake; I should be very in∣discreet to speak in this extravagant man∣ner of that which we have so often discoursed of before, and which puts me to as much trouble as your self, since the Confessor and Penitent are both fastened with the same Chain; there is another far different My∣stery, a Mystery of Iniquity which you have not yet discovered, and which is come to my knowledge by a way which you would scarce ever divine; and assure your self it will be to your good to make a right use of my Re∣monstrance, and to the discharge of my Soul if you reject it: what I say may serve you for correction, if you take it as you ought, and for advertisement, though you have no desire to profit by it: Now you must know, there is a grand difference, betwixt the Laws positive and common, and those that are Di∣vine; for as men have made the Laws po∣sitive, so may they dispense with them; but for Divine Ordinances, they are indispen∣sable, and whoever seeks excuses to palliate iniquity, doubles the Crime, and is doubly culpable. For Example, as to the use of Ecclesiastical goods, the Holy Father, who
is Supreme and Sovereign Disposer of them, may favour those with them, whom he judges fit and deserving; but there is no earthly Authority that can dispense with these Di∣vine Commandments, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not com∣mit adultery. This the good man spake confusedly, that he might not suddenly touch the sore of him, whom he thought wound∣ed. To this Alcimus reply'd: Father, If I were as innocent upon the Hypothesis, which you have made touching the positive Right, as upon the three last Articles of the Divine, which you mentioned, my Soul would enjoy a profound peace, and I should have but little cause to doubt of Di∣vine Grace: For, as for Murther, my hands are very clear from blood, and I desire not the death of any man. As for other Men's Goods, I am so far from having my hands sullied with them, or my desires therewith touched, that those which I already possess, lie some∣somewhat too heavy on me. And as for the Wife of another, God preserve me from desiring her, since I never cast my eyes upon any lawful Subject, which I
would be willing to take to my self; and this is the only point of difference that ever happens betwixt me and my Parents, who desire nothing so much as to see me married; nor is there any thing I fly from more, being more de∣sirous of the benefit of the Field, than the confinement of the Cage: And my Soul being thus estranged, even from honest and lawful affections, what is it from unjust and unlawful ones? For, besides my aversion from all Women in general, I have a particular abhorrency against the worser sort of them; and as for those that are engaged in Marriage, I cannot have the confidence so much as to look on them, for fear, not only of the secret adultery of a wanton look, but of violating so holy a Sacrament, which is the most Sacred Bond of Hu∣mane Society. O Adam, where art thou? cryed Sim∣plicius (thinking that these fair words were only designed as a Looking-Glass moved against the Sun, to cast the Rayes in his eyes) What Seigneur Alcimus, think you thus to lead an old Man by the Nose, who though he may come short of you in quick wit and fancy, is as much beyond
you in Experience? Once more, Where art thou Adam? Do you think thus to hide your nakedness from my sight with Fig-leaves? I may justly threaten you, if you persevere in this course, to shew your impiety to the people, and cast your shame in your own face: conceal not your self so vainly therefore, O Infant of my Soul; Prevaricator of the Laws of God: Look back into your own heart, and retake your former Virtue; fall again to your former good Works, and by a sound Repentance, regain your lost Robe of Innocence: Return, O Shunamite re∣turn. Come back thou Prodigal to thy Fa∣thers house, whilst his arms are yet open to receive thee, and the acceptable day of Sal∣vation is yet in the dawning: O fly and meet the beauteous Orient of the Sun of Mercy, which if once declined, can never be re∣gained; and then it will be too late to cast off the works of darkness, when the whole Armour of Light is got beyond your reach. Alcimus more astonisht then before, knew not what to answer to this dis∣course so full of obscurity, the words of which were as so many Aenigma's. Good Father (reply'd he) speak more plainly that I may understand and an∣swer
you, for how long will you hold me in suspence? tell me but my of∣fence and I am ready for the chastise∣ment; and may all the arrows of hea∣ven's vengeance make a butt of my head, if I know my self guilty of more then I have already confest to you: Have I committed murther, theft, or adultery? I speak not of ei∣ther of the two first (replyed Simplici∣us) nor of the effects of the third, but who knows not that as in good deeds God accepts the will for the deed, so evils but designed by a determined re∣solution, are as much as executed be∣fore him, since we have to do with a God who searcheth the hearts and try∣eth the reins; before whom all things are open, and nothing hid, who seeth our thoughts afar off, and understand∣eth our designs before they be disclo∣sed: he will not hold him innocent, who performs not an evil if he have but once designed it; for his own mouth hath declared, that he who looks up∣on his neighbour's wife with a lustful eye, hath committed Adultery with her in his heart already: And to what serve all your serenades, your pran∣cings,
carreers, turns and returns (it being the property of evil to have a circular motion) your amorous looks and glances, and other such like acti∣ons which are daily remarkable in your deportment, the eye of the world which you think bleared, is far more piercing then you imagine; yet we have it from good authority how mali∣cious it is withall; Our sinful Parents did us breed, We them in wickedness exceed; Our children will more Vices love, And theirs will worse then Vipers prove: Thus Ages change, thus the World worse does grow, Till he that made both, both doth over∣throw. The world has as much advantage of you in craft as age: It is hard for you, though never so subtle, to charm the sight of this many-eyed Argus: If the malicious oft see (by false conjectures) the things that are not, how much more easily will they see visible, yea
palpable ones: believe me, your fire cannot burn without some smoke, and who can keep a fire in his breast, and conceal all the sparks from the sight of the world: So many corvets and gal∣lantries are not made without some design, some unhappy one, which per∣haps, unless you take heed of your self, will invelope you in grand dis∣asters, and though your designs may be built up to their full perfection, will at last intomb you in your own ruines. I speak this without any other interest then the desire of your good, and fear of your misfortune; I should not love, you if I should dissemble that which would be so prejudicial to you; friendship and flattery are two distinct things, too remote to be comprehended in the circumference of one breast: Fi∣nally, return unto your self, and turn from what is bad, cease from what is evil, and practice what is good: God has given you too good talents both of wit and body, to be miserably im∣ployed, as upon the search of what is forbidden by the giver, and the posses∣sion of which cannot be but pernicious to you. Pardon me if by this touch of
my lancet, I have opened the impost∣hume, which might else prove mortal, in respect not only of a temporal life, but also of an eternal one, and take these remonstrances of coming origi∣nally from a heart which makes its own safety a partaker in yours. This oblique way of speaking plunged Alcimus in a greater trouble then be∣fore; and not able to divine who it was that had given him so charitable an ad∣monition by the means of this good Fa∣ther, whom he greatly honoured and esteemed, as a faithful servant to God, as well as a friend to him, he begun to call heaven and earth to his party, and firmly to defend his own innocence; but the more he strove to perswade Sim∣plicius that the report he had heard was false, the more did he believe it true: which brought him to such profound oaths and imprecations, as the ears of this Religious Father could not endure, they approached so near (as he thought) to blasphemy; upon which he said, And think you, Alcimus, that adul∣tery is a crime to be purged by oaths, or that the crime of perjury (as two
pellets) can drive away and clear you of that of Sacriledge? if this were ad∣mitted, the most wicked villains would soon be discharged of their crimes, and the accused would quickly be set free: But I see how the case stands, and that you who have not had con∣fidence in me in a sacred Tribunal, where my life is bound up with my fi∣delity, will be much further from re∣vealing your secrets to me now, when we are but upon the terms of ordinary discourse; remember only this, That it is as easie to beguile man, as impos∣sible to deceive God; and he who strives to do either, does fool himself in the first place, and then, as the wise man saith, Who will not deride the charmer that is bitten by his own Ser∣pent? Father, (replyed Alcimus) I know you speak all this but to essay the pa∣tience of your Penitent, and I wish that heaven may never pardon it, but contrarily invent some unheard of pu∣nishment for me, showring down all its Anathema's upon my head, if I have knowingly concealed any thing from you, which I thought my self bound in
conscience to discover, or the conceal∣ment of which might in the least ren∣der me culpable; God preserve me from so double, deceitful and sacrile∣gious a thought, and I do solemnly assure you, by whatever is most sacred in earth or heaven, that I have no de∣sign upon any Woman whatsoever, much less upon the Wife of another man. All that I can say is, that this must either be jealousie, which often sees that which is not, or calumny, that has contrived this accusation a∣gainst me, and with which I see your spirit so prepossest, that unless it please God to interpose his hand, I know not how you will ever be disabused: I know the respect I owe to your cha∣racter, and how much I am obliged to the wholsome remonstrances that proceed from your Fatherhood, and whatever you shall please to say or do to me, shall find a ready observance from me, knowing what ascendant both our spiritual and temporal Fa∣thers ought to have over us: I shall only patiently attend, till time (which is the Father of Truth) bring forth light out of darkness, and witness my
sincerity and integrity to the world; I confess my self a grievous sinner before God, but not to be ranged amongst A∣dultererers, Lyars, and Sacrilegious: and if ever you have thought me wor∣thy either of your belief or friendship, you will clear your self of this Opi∣nion. Simplicius, who believed that this fair Language resembled those delicate Vi∣ands, which turn either into exquisite nourishment, or extreme putrefaction, thinking that this young man so fallen into, and strengthned in iniquity, that it was impossible to draw him to an ac∣knowledgment of it, having briefly declared to him the desperate condition (as he thought) his Soul stood in, and that he was upon the brink of destru∣ction, desired him for the future to pro∣vide himself of another Guide to accom∣pany him in so perillous a Voyage; for him, he was resolved to save himself, and so quitted himself of his Office: After having given him this charitable ad∣vice, That if he left not his former Cour∣ses and Gallantries, accompanied with his too evident sollicitations of a Lady of Ho∣nour and Quality, he would find him∣self
into the Grave, when he thought himself furthest from it; not in the midst, but even upon the point of his best days, by an accident, as miserable as unsuspected: And there∣upon left him, without suffering Alci∣mus his instant entreaties to extract from him a more particular declara∣tion. This Gentleman remained in no little confusion of thoughts; for though fear (the ordinary tormentor of the guil∣ty) changed not his courage; yet the apprehensions of death (so atural to all men) and that too of a suddain and unprovided one, did nearly touch his spirit joining to this his just curiosity, to know who could thus have seasoned the belief of this good Father, with so false a calumny: he passed all the night without closing his eyes, and in strange interior convulsions, agitated with a continual remorse that he had not yet abandoned the Church-revenues, which he detained and spent so unjustly. Perhaps (said he within himself) this imaginary adultery which I never thought of, serves for a colour to that true one which I daily commit; adulterating, that is to say, abusing
the goods of the Spouse of the Son of God; applying to profane uses and ornaments, what ought only to be im∣ployed in pious and holy functions: The height of riches and wisdom of God is extream, his Judgments in∣comprehensible, and his ways inscru∣table: How many malefactors have we seen dragged to punishment for crimes which they never acted, and yet had other-ways merited death, for more black and wicked Villanies, which had been hid till revealed by their own dis∣covery Sure God is just, and his Judg∣ment is right, and he knows both how and why he punisheth. Who can the Sun of darkness blame, Or who 'gainst God complaints can frame? Or say his Judgments are not right, Who's of Justice made up as t'other is of light. The Sun had scarce restored his face all crowned with Rayes, to our Horizon, when Alcimus, who had never closed his eye-lids, but tormented with divers fan∣cres, leapt from his bed, whose Feathers were more pungent than so many
Thorns; not able to find rest till he had reduced his Soul to its Centre, that is to God, who is it's true place, and his Grace, the Tabernacle of the God of Jacob; he went streight-away to Father Simplicius, to be cleared of all these Aenig∣ma's, which had overwhelmed him with so many inquietudes: Simplicius suffered himself to be long press'd, and intreated before he would grant him audience; but the double force of obedience and condescention, render'd exorable the cha∣rity which animated him. Alcimus ha∣ving declared to him the torment in which he had left him, and the inquie∣tudes which had robb'd him of that nights sleep. I question it not (reply'd Simplicus) for a bad Conscience is an executioner to him that has not quite lost the sence of his Crime. It is a good sign when one awakes from a lethar∣gick slumber; this gives some appearance of recovery; but when one continues sleeping in the Regions of the shadow of death, 'tis a sign that the enemy of our Salvation pre∣vails against Grace. God be praised, who by the healing Eye-salve of my Remon∣strance, hath restored you your sight, and
made you see the deplorable and dangerous state in which you before did sleep so supine∣ly. Be of good courage, you shall not die but live, to sing eternally the marvellous opera∣tions of divine Mercy. My dear Father (reply'd Alcimus) I am now blinder than ever, and more igno∣rant, of what (as I am your spiritual Son) I suppose you ought to tell me more plainly; 'cause that I may see, (as the blind man said to our Saviour) for certainly however it be, you ought more plainly to lay open to me the par∣ticulars of this report, that if it be true, I may say as David did to Nathan, I have sinned; or if it be otherwise, with Joseph falsely accused, and unjustly im∣prisoned, I am innocent of what is laid to my charge. Seigneur Alcimus (said Simplicius) pray speak no more of your innocence, being so notoriously convinced; otherwise you will make me believe you are one of those whom Solomon speaks of, who think themselves clean and pure, and yet are filled with filth and iniquity. If the Infant but one day old is not exempt from sin (as the Scripture tell: us) one of your age, accomplishments, and
liberty, that is free and dis-intangled from all sorts of love both lawful and unlawful, may well be accounted A Bird as rare, As black Swans are. But think not to feed me now as yesterday you did with aery words, for I have more seri∣ous affairs to look after, and which do more justly merit the time which we imploy here in cajolleries and vain contestations: I have have said enough to you, therefore as Jo∣shuah said to Achan, Give glory to God in confessing your fault, and reconciling your self by a true Repentance, to him whom you have so grievously offended. I know how un∣serviceable I am to you in any Function but this, and you may find Companions enough in the World amongst whom to ease your itch of talking, without troubling the repose and silence of a Cloister with the same: Father, (replied Alcimus) the giving glory to God by a true Confession, is the sole scope of my intention; for I see well the little credit which my words can obtain, if not supported by this prop of Penitence, and mixed with a Sacrament, the profaning of which by a Lye merits no less the eternal Damnation; for
which cause I am more firmly resolved than ever to disburthen my Soul to you in a sincere and hearty Confession. Simplicius knowing that there are twelve hours in the day, and that the Sinner ought to be seiz'd on in the criti∣cal minute, without further delay ac∣cepted this condition, thinking this the only means to withdraw this Soul from the jaws of the infernal Wolf, and from the open Gates of eternal perdition: At this Sacred Tribunal, from whence Lyes are banish'd under so severe Penalties, the innocent Alcimus discovered the secrets of his heart to his Ghostly Father, who yet took all this for nought but artifices; wherefore after many menaces of the wrath of God, if he remained obstinate in his will; and after having pressed home to him this Sentence of Tertullian, If thou hidest thy self in Confession here, thou shalt be hid in the eternal Dungeons hereafter. Alcimus answered, Holy Father, if the gaping jaws of Hell were now ready to re∣ceive me, and all its dismal Inhabitants fitted to receive me, I am able to say no more than I have done, I only desire this favour (which those that like you do man∣nage
and direct our Consciences, ought not to deny to the most miserable) that you would please to endeavour to supply by your Inter∣rogatories, what you think wanting in my Confession. David could not have forgot his Murther and Adultery, yet he remain'd a whole year without consideration or disco∣very of it; till the Prophet laying his hand upon the sore, presently made him feel the smart, and look out for a remedy. Certainly (reply'd Simplicius) I may answer you as St. Ambrose did Theodosi∣us, who alledged this Example, That you that have followed him in his sin, if not in effect, yet at least in intention (which is the same Crime in the sight of God) should likewise answer him in repentance. And you, Father (answered Alcimus) be pleas'd to follow Nathan's steps, in draw∣ing this thorn gently out of my heart. Simplicius thinking at this word that he had won the Town, without losing time, and designing to accommodate himself to this tender spirit, which he thought to be sick of the most danger∣ous of all Feavers, which is that of Love; after having by many circumlocutions imitated the Chyrurgion, who seeming only to anoint with Cotton dipt in Oyl,
the aposthumed breast of a delicate La∣dy, does dextrously open it with a hid∣den Lancet; so he by degrees at last brought Alcimus upon the point of his evening airings and motions on Horse∣back; all which Alcimus confessed, ex∣aggerating (like a true Penitent) the excess and superfluity of his Habits and Attendance, the pleasure he took in hearing the praises and applauses of those that beheld him, and the ex∣treme vanity with which his Soul was this way swelled. Thence Simplicius proceeded to the street where Capole∣on lived, a Gentleman for Estate and Quality, well known throughout the whole City; asking him, why he went there so often, and made a longer stay there than any where else; particularly before that house? At this word Alcimus perceived the subject of this long Discourse, and an∣swered briskly, Certainly Father, we are as much de∣ceiv'd in what we see through jealous eyes, as through a false Prospective. Upon which Simplicius recounted to him that which (else he thought) all the Town talked and took notice of, the jea∣lousie
of Capoleon, the violence of which had made him become a common Pro∣verb. And is not this (said he) a just cause of Jealousie to a man of his age, who is Husband to a young and fair Lady; though certainly as virtuous as beautiful, to see one so openly seek her, to court and caress her by words, and actions, glances and countenan∣ces which are neither just nor honest? This is the property of the jealous (said Alcimus) to believe that all things conspire the ruine of their Honour: the Days, the Nights, the Stars, the Ele∣ments, the very Animals are suspected by them, much more reasonable Creatures; they fear where there is not the least sub∣ject of suspition, the Shadows to them are Substances, & their vain Suspitions pal∣pable Convictions, and their false ima∣ginations evident and undoubted Veri∣ties: But be pleased to tell me (Reve∣rend Father) of whom in particular Capoleon is jealous; for there is no ap∣pearance it should be of me, who know his Wife so little, that I stould not di∣stinguish her amongst a Troop of others. I have seen her amongst other young Ladies before she was made his; but be∣held her only as an Object which never obliged me to a particular regard: I
think I have seen her too amongst other women since her Marriage, whilst she appeared in Companies; but since her Husband has given her Angelica's Ring, and by a streit Imprisonment has ren∣dred her invisible, even to the Eyes of Heaven, certainly I must have more than a Lynx his sight, to penetrate those Walls which inclose her: If the good Mans Feaver burn only on this side, it is very easie to be healed. Here Simplicius believing that Alci∣mus still persisted in his dissimulation, lift∣ing up his voice with a more strong and piercing Tone than formerly, with a vi∣olent impetuosity, vehemence of spirit, he said, Do you consider what it is you do, or that you stand in the presence of an Almighty God? Or have you ever read or heard of the ter∣rible Judgment that light upon Ananias and Saphira; it is not now a mortal man, but an Eternal God that you impose upon: Where∣upon he began to use the Word, as the Apostle saith, In season, and out of season, with opportunity, and even with importunity, to reprove, pray, conjure, to cry in all pati∣ence and soundness of Doctrine: Have you forgot (said he) that the excuse of Adam, and that of Cain, were worse than their
faults? or that the Royal Prophet begged of God to set a watch before the door of his lips, lest he offended with his tongue, in seek∣ing excuses or specious pretences, to palliate or extenuate his iniquity? for when once it is come to this point (from which God preserve you) to sin not only with impunity, but therefore to think they do it with Rea∣son, then is one arrived to the highest pitch of wickedness; and if this be your case, it is no better than desperate and deplorable. By this I understand (reply'd Alcimus) that Capoleon is jealous of me, thinking that my passages and managements in his street, and sometimes before his Gate, are Incense and Perfumes which I offer to that Idol, which ought to be adored by none but himself. O God! was ever seen such a profound dissimulation? I can affirm, that there is no person, I will not say, in that Quarter, but even in the whole Town, that has so much applauded me upon this sub∣ject as himself, nor any that has so much puffed up my fancy thereby. To whom hereafter shall we trust? since by flatte∣ries and caresses one is so basely deceived? Certainly, the Wise man spoke with much reason, when he said, My Son, those that feed thee with fair speeches and artificial
prayses, are those that do decline or would seduce thee: But this man has given me as just cause for the future to distrust him, as his was unjust for suspecting me, who had never the least thought of attempting the Honour of his Wife, whom I hold to be as virtuous as fair: And if my judgment fail me not, worthy of a better chance than falling into his cruel hands. My dear Father (continued he) I give you my humblest thanks for your charitable admonition, and promise you for the future to stand upon my guard, and to cause (with∣out prejudice to my Honour) that he shall lose his evil opinion of me. Simplicius then seeing that the Masque was taken off, and that it was now time to speak plainly, protested to him (as the truth was) that Capoleon had never spoke word to him of this Affair, but that he had learnt it from a pious Soul (for such he esteemed Vannoza to be) and one desirous both of his temporal and eternal welfare. Father (said Alcimus) It is a thing so shameful to a jealous Husband to discover his own baseness, that I believe Capoleon would not make you this report himself; but has for that purpose made use of a third per∣son, who under the pretext of Piety (a vir∣tue,
which opens the ears and hearts of Re∣ligious Souls) has informed you of this false relation, to the prejudice of Truth, and the sincerity of my own Conscience: I stand here in the presence of God, and in a place where I had rather die, than be like Ananias; but I do assure you, and sacredly affirm upon the salvation of my Soul (which I value as a good Christian ought) that I never had any adulterous design upon the Wife of Capole∣on; and of this you may assure this charita∣ble Soul; and withal (lest I should leave any of my Honour disadvantageously engaged) that if I were as well assured of my Salva∣on, and as little afraid of the Divine Ju∣stice, as I am of the weak efforts of the jea∣lous-pated Capoleon, I might well put my self into the number of the Elect; and I fear not, but by Gods assistance, to shelter my self, not only from his menaces, but also from the wicked and pernicious effects of his un∣just and vain suspicion; I would gladly love him, because God has commanded it, but will also endeavour to safe my self from the surprize of so treacherous an Enemy. Simplicius judging by these words of this Gentleman, whose heart he had long known the very secrets of, that he spoke the real truth, and that with an unfeign∣ed
Charity he accused himself of that in which he found himself innocent; would insist no longer upon that subject, for fear of drawing blood from the nipple or the nose, by too much sucking the one, or wringing the other, and imagining that Vannoza had discovered to him the real Jealousy of her Husband, founded upon the false opinion of Alcimus his pur∣suits, he contented himself with what his Penitent had already discover'd; but to prevent all future mishaps, and to pluck up by the roots the hatred from his heart which he had conceived against Capoleon, whom he had already named his Enemy, (a word of war and defiance in this splee∣natique Country) he again protested to him, that Capoleon neither by himself nor Deputy had given him this advertise∣ment, or made these menaces, but that it was a religious and timorous Soul, which perhaps had too far exaggerated the mat∣ter, and according to the Proverb, had painted the Lyon fiercer than he was; that he desired him not to look upon Ca∣poleon with the worse eye for this, nor to do any thing, further to promote his Malady, which was of the nature of those artificial Fires, which every thing
would nourish; but nothing extinguish: That he ought to have compassion of such infirmities of spirit, according to the Apostles advice, who would that Spiri∣tual Persons, and those who are fortified within, should bear with greater forti∣tude and patience the faults and insolen∣cies of the weak, to accomplish the Law, which would that we should bear with one another's infirmities: Adding, that the only remedy he perceived for this misunderstanding, was to abstain for the future from these passes in the Street, at least till time with his insensible Spunge had effaced from the spirit of this offend∣ed Husband the impressions which his e∣vil humour might perhaps have engraved there, it being no part of a prudent man to exasperate the Wasp, or to provoke the Bee; which last though naturally of a sweet and gentle temper, as being born and bred amongst Honey, knew well e∣nough how to manage its Sting to de∣fend its Comb: And further, That a true Penitent was not only oblig'd to part from the Territories, but from the Con∣fines of Evil; for to what purpose is it to quit the unfortunate City of Iniquity, and take up Quarters in the Suburbs?
I mean within those of the occasions of Evil, to fly to Zoar and look back to So∣dom? It is not enough for the true Naza∣rites to drink no Wine nor strong Drink, unless they also abstain too from the very Grape, least the taste of the one breed a desire of the other. With these Reasons Simplicius strengthened his Remonstran∣ces, without assuming the power of commanding, but certainly with Coun∣sel accompanied with the Spirit of God, he advis'd Alcimus to turn away his course from the frequentation Of those so dreadful Rocks and Shelves, Where multitudes had split themselves. Alcimus found it very difficult to submit to these Injunctions, alledging that the Laws of Cloisters and those of the World were very far different; that the one prescribed to honour a blind submission, and a renunciation of all Earthly enjoy∣ments, but that in the World it was one of the greatest marks of Infamy to re∣ceive Laws from the will of the Enemy; and that
Couragious souls, like an unshaken Rock Undauntedly should brave the rudest shoock. Nothing's more base than to bad men to yield, Or to their proud attempts to quit the field. Hereby Simplicius perceiving that this was a spark of that hidden fire which would not suddainly be extinguisht, Seig∣neur Alcimus (said he) if you find this re∣medy too difficult, you will constrain me to say, that you chain your self to the Bank of Ini∣quity, and tug at the oar of violence, and then feign obstacles for your obeying of whole∣some Precepts. Remember Saul's maledicti∣on for disobeying Samuel; t'is a Crime, to disbelieve, but a kind of Witchcraft to dis∣obey; to speak plainly, you would hereby perswade me to that which I am unwilling to believe, and under pretext of opposing your wrath to the hatred of the Husband, make me suspect a secret affection for the Wife: For, Who often'st saith I hate, does prove Most commonly deepest in Love. Moreover, you are bound in Conscience to give no occasion of offence or scandal in your deportments; for if the great Apostle de∣clare,
that he would eat no flesh so long as he lived, rather than by eating to offend the weakest of his Brethren; How much more ought you to avoid the Actions and Occasions which might give suspicion of the works of the flesh, unjustly desired or pursued after? And if the same Apostle would not that the least mention of Fornication should be made a∣mongst Christians, how much more odious and detestable ought Adultery to be, either in action or affection? Father (said Alcimus) your discourses are backt with Reason, and speak you both a Christian and Religious Person; but be pleas'd to consider, that I am not of your Reli∣gious Orders, but yet a Christian like you, although a secular and mundain one; and though there be no more agreement betwixt the rules of Piety and those of the World, than betwixt light and darkness, the Ark and Dagon, or God and Mammon, yet are we obliged in performing the one, not to omit the other, if we intend to preserve our Repu∣tation, without which we render our selves the reproach of the World, and the most ab∣ject dregs or scum of the People. Consider that I am now a Sword-man, and that former∣ly studying Cases of Conscience, I have learnt
that when an Enemy shall attacque me, I am not bound to fly, and save my life with the loss of my Honour; and though the Evan∣gelical precept of turning the other cheek to him that smites him on the one, extend its self to secular persons as well as regular, yet we see it otherwise practised by both: Our blessed Saviour asked that Wretch who shamefully struck him, Why he did so? and though he did not call Legions of Angels to his succour, or employed Thunder and Tem∣pests to revenge such injuries (as he might have done) yet did he mix this point of seve∣rity amongst his admirable meekness, and in∣comparable humility. If Capoleon attack me, I think it will be lawful to resist him, and perhaps with the same weapons I shall turn the mischief upon him, which he designed for me, and confound this Conjurer with his own Devil; for I am resolved not to suffer my self to be assassinated by his treacherous hands. Here Simplicius interrupted this Dis∣course, fearing that if he let Alcimus proceed, he would excite that choler in himself which he should be ill troubled to allay, and perhaps according to the prom∣ptitude of his youthful inclination, pro∣ceed at last from words to execution: He
therefore smooth'd and flatter'd this ge∣nerous courage, protesting (indeed too truly) Capoleons innocence, and that the report which had been made him, might perhaps be false (too truly false) but that this his Paternal zeal and care made him not only worthy of Pardon, but of Praise and Affection; saying, O Alcimus, Al∣cimus, you know not what it is to be a Father, a spiritual Father, had you but experimen∣ted how the bowels of the Soul yern after the Infants of the Spirit, you might be capa∣ble to judge of that ardour which made those words boyl over from the mouths of Moses and St. Paul, when they desired to be ac∣cursed for the good of their dear Children and Brethren in righteousness; the day will come when you will know this verity, and look upon that in me with a good eye, which perhaps does now appear otherwise to you. Your heart, dear Father (answer'd Al∣cimus) is too right towards me, to do or say any thing amiss; what ever comes from you to me can never be received otherwise than well; but withal, I once more intreat you not to condemn me without hearing, for judgment without preindication, and preju∣dice without judgment is the high way to er∣rour;
it is easie to impeach, but not to con∣vince; to say, not to produce witnesses; to declare, but not to prove; if accusing will suffice, who can be innocent, what shelter for the good, if the storms of the wicked be Oracles. And, Father since God inj it, to obey him, I am willing to walk i an unpleasant path, and shall gladly look on Capoleon as my friend, and dear Christian Brother, and I am so far from wishing him any evil, that I desire him all sorts of good; but since distrust is the Mother of se∣curity, you must allow me to beware of my self, and that not only of my life, but of my Honour, which every noble mind will esteem more than life. In this temper of mind, and having disburthened my Soul to you of all that laid upon it, I hope you will not deny me the benefit of absolution. Here Simplicius found himself surpri∣zed, having to deal with a Souldier, who knew as well how to feign with his Tongue as Sword, one thing only he required of him in the Name of the Lord, which was, To shun all rash attempts in his just hate, And make his wrath way to evaporate.
And principally for some days to avoid his accustommed passages in that street; and at last by much conjuring and intreaty he extorted this Promise, rather violently from his mouth, than voluntarily from his heart; this was not the first and free drop∣pings of the Myrrhe; but rather the second gathering, extracted from the Tree, by scratching it with Iron Instruments. Alcimus left Simplicius, more satisfied with his having disabused him, than with his simplicity in so slightly belie∣ving the report; and troubled withal, that he could not learn from him whence he had had this advice; for he would ra∣ther have suspected any person in the world, than Vannoza, whom he held for dead amongst its obscurities. In what darkness and ignorance do we spin out the thread of a frail life! Mean while Vannoza, who sleeps lit∣tle, and the Devil much less, are hatch∣ing mischiefs on all hands; for whilst the one as subtle as invinsible, blows wrath and malice into the ears of Alcimus, the other as dangerous as visible, presents her self to those of Simplicius, to know the success of her false report; for it was her principal design (like another Eve)
to open the eyes of Alcimus, by tasting the forbidden Fruit, and to procure him to look diligently in his passage towards every part of her house, from whence he was otherwise regarded than she pretended, he suspected, or Simplicius be∣lieved; that she might thereby find means to make signs to him, as Vessels stuck fast upon a Shelve, or in other di∣stress, do for help to those Ships that pass by. But she was infinitely astonish'd, when she found by Father Simplicius his recital, that she had ruined her own pro∣ject, and wounded her self by her own Weapon, and by an ill-temper'd Plaister, brought her Sore from an Ulcer to a Gangrene; and further when she learnt that Alcimus had not the least thought or affection for her; this consideration made her despair of success; but to those who are irremediably overthrown, it is a kind of comfort that they can fear no further mischief: She took new vigour, when she understood from Simplicius the indifferency he had for all her Sex, judg∣ing that the purity and whiteness of this Paper would easily be susceptible of the first impression, and that this green Wood once lighted, would burn most
fiercely; Love being a Mystery, in which the Apprentices are Masters; She begun to project new Designes how to bring down that untamed Courage, which was yet proof against all Loves Assaults; and to recal this wild and untaught Hawk to the Lure; At present she only told Sim∣plicius, that his Monastick life and Reli∣ous innocence, rendred him less subtle in searching into the secrets of the heart, and the spiritual wickedness of worldly thoughts; and of those, who under pre∣tence of affection, make it their glory to deceive: believing that Heaven laughs at their Perjuries and Oaths, which are only writ on running waters; who hold for a Maxime, That Love, Wine, and Secrets are worth nothing when they have taken the Air; and that it seemed in our Age, men had effaced this practice from the number of sins; it being not only common but commendable: final∣ly that it was the shuttle-cock of Courts, but the ruinous Arrow of hearts; she on∣ly, wisht him to beware of a surprize, and since he had drawn from Alcimus a pro∣mise not to pass through that quarter of a good while, that he should take care that he found a firm performance and
long continuance. See here how this subtile crafty Female spoke what was as far from her desire as intention. In the mean time having painted her face with a lively joy, she returned home rather dead than living, with sadness so deeply rooted in her Soul, or rather her Soul so deeply plunged in sorrow, that she knew not whether it were fittest to reckon her∣self amongst the dead or living. She had now lost the sight of her North-Star, her days were now become but nights, and the very sight of the Sun was disagree∣able; overwhelm'd with sadness, sorrow, and melancholy, she did nothing else but sigh and groan like the solitary widowed Turtle, bewailing nothing but the loss of the sight of her amiable Alcimus. Was not I (said she) sufficiently miserable without adding more to my misfortunes? To what new mischief do the Heavens reserve me, having thus condemned me to perpetual dark∣ness? O thou Light of my Eyes how art thou clouded! those short and little glances of thee which I once enjoyed, did give me some sort of consolation, but this sad Eclipse is insup∣portable, which for ever deprives me of so dear an Object, and which to me does seem the pleasantest in the World; But come
what will, I must once more have a sight of my dearest Alcimus, and I will never leave any way unattempted, though never so dan∣gerous, before I resolve to perish. Mean time the days slipt away, and this Star never appeared. O Nights! far longer than those of Norway; She oft stood Sentinel like another Hero, but ne∣ver could set eye on her Leander: The confusion of her thoughts robbed her of Discourse as well as of Invention, which made her become lean and pale, her Hus∣band believing that it was the austerity of Religion, and her continual contem∣plation that wrought this change: He did what he could to divert her, but his troublesome Caresses did but inflame her sorrow. She kisses and embraces intermix'd, But on her absent Love her thoughts were fix'd. She had once like to have imitated Poti∣phar's Wife, who accused the innocent Joseph of a Crime of which she alone was culpable; but reserving this desperate means for the last extremity, she was un∣willing to betray one who had never of∣fended
her, and on whose affection only depended all her contentment. See here the subtility of this wicked Woman, who thought by sowing an irreconcileable quarrel betwixt Alcimus and her Hus∣band, to heal her passion which way soe∣ver the chance fell: for Alcimus once slain, her flames would be extinguisht with his funeral Torches, and her insupportable Passion buried in his Grave; but if Ca∣poleon should fall under his misfortune, she saw her way made plain over his Grave to the end of her designs, and by her Widowhood put into possession of her self, and left to a free pursuit after the satisfaction of her ardent desires. A strange fetch of female subtility. But still she dissembled her thoughts, and made no outward shew but of Sadness and De∣votion, as if these two qualities were in∣separable, and thereby she sunk deeper into her Husband's belief the opinion that it was only her Devotion that pro∣cured this Melancholy; and the truth is, a feigned, false, constrained Piety (if such deep Hypocrisie may bear so fair a Title) does oftentimes ingender this sort of sad∣ness which is begot by the interiour worm of a cauteriz'd Conscience, which
does incessantly gnaw upon the heart: She was however much pleased to see her old Man so much concerned at her seeming Melancholy; and the more he seem'd to be troubled at it, the more cause she still gave him to be so. Whilest she so dully past her time, like a Hunter upon a cold Scent, the Devil, who like a roaring Lyon, has his eyes and mouth still open for a prey, way-laying his stratagems in the spirit of Alcimus, and fanning his delusions into his head, and so diligently blew up this spark of anger which he had against Capoleon, that at last he stirred up a devouring flame in his heart; He represented to him the de∣spicable Age, and ridiculous weakness of his Enemy, together with the base pusil∣lanimity of fearing so inconsiderable an Antagonist, who was so far below his birth and quality; that he would dero∣gate from both, if he did not turn his treacherous designs upon his own head, who durst not have undertaken such vil∣lanous enterprizes, had he not believed that he who ought to be a Gentleman of courage and gallantry, had quitted both for the Counsel of a timerous Monk; that these Cloister-spirits are never susce∣ptible
of generous resolutions, that like Reeds, they cannot resist a Tempest but by compliance; that gallant Souls ought to imitate the Cedars of Lebanon, that can be shaken by nought but thunder; that going out well accompanied, he might bid defiance to his Enemy, and pass his Horses hoofs over his belly, if he durst assault him; that there needed nothing but a good Armour to defend him a∣gainst treachery, and that he ought to embrace such occurrences which might manifest his courage and gallantry; for amongst Men of the Sword, nothing but danger can shew what a Man is made of: These were the Remonstrances of the E∣nemy both of his Soul and Body, who seemed so diligent a Preserver of the ho∣nour of the one, and the safety of the o∣ther, though his design was only to bring them both to destruction. Alcimus puft up by the vanity of these thoughts, did like the Lyon stir up his rage by bea∣ting his own sides, and fancying to him∣self, that his imaginary Enemy would too gloriously triumph at his too easy retreat, if upon the meer advertisement of a Reli∣gious Father, he forced himself to hu∣mour a jealous Coxcomb, those few days
which his promise had bound him to ab∣stain from his ordinary courses seem'd so many ages to him, and this short retreat did but whet his Appetite, and his going back was but to take the greater leap; Therefore at length he return'd to tread over again his former steps, more proud∣ly and nobly accompanied, mounted and accountred than before, becoming a new Spectacle of pomp and gallantry to all Beholders; his Lacqueys were well arm∣ed with good swords, and daggers, and private pistols, resolved (though igno∣rant of the design and quarrel) to sell their skins dearly to those that should prove Chapmen for their bodies; he had also some disguised Bravo's to accompany him, which are a sort of People that will kill a man there as cheap as Bailiffs will arrest him in other places: As for him∣self, he wore under his Clothes a Skirt of Male, and carried one of his best Swords, not forgetting his Fire-arms, and private head-piece, resolved in this Equipage, To be reveng'd of this affront, Or hazard Life and Soul upon't. Thus did this innocent young Gentleman
arm himself to encounter shadows, Chi∣mera's conceived in a Woman's brain, and distill'd through the Alimbeck of a Mo∣nastick simplicity. What inward joy sur∣prized Vannoza, when through her u∣sual Watch-tower, she saw this beauteous Star mount the Horizon of her Street, he must needs be a most accomplisht Oratour that can express the frozen North, which after a Night of six Months long sees the first rayes of the Sun appear to visit her, but not more joy than she had now to feed her eyes with so ravishing an Object; her only unhappiness amidst this bliss was, that she could not communicate her sen∣timents to him that caus'd them; but ta∣king occasion by the fore-lock, she resol∣ved to discover her face through the case∣ment, and to talk to him in a Language of looks and signs, a custome so common in this Countrey, (born to nothing but dumb shows and such refined inventions) that if he were not altogether stupid, he could not chuse but thereby perceive the Flame he had unwillingly kindled in her Soul. Alcimus turning his Eyes with a proud and menacing look towards the house, wondering that he could perceive no body at the windows, at last attentive∣ly
regarding it every way, he saw a lit∣tle casement open at the top of the house, from whence he presently expected a treacherous shot; Alas! too true a one which pierced not his body but his Heat: David, of old, a King so Holy, and (till then) so innocent, looking from the lofty top of his Palace, saw within a Garden a Bird, or rather a Fish within a Fountain, which at one glance of the Eye foiled all his holy resolutions to the ground: Alcimus who was made of no better a mould, looking up from the street, and expecting nothing but the levelling of a Harquebuz at his bo∣dy, felt the blow of a more dangerous one than he expected, I mean a Basilisk's Eyes in a beautious face, which soon grinded to dust all his Virtuous intenti∣ons: During this interview he made his Horse corvet and bound, and exercised all his most excellent postures; till see∣ing so many attractious circumscribed in so small a compass, and so many charms contracted in one face, he thought the windows of Heaven had been opened, and that he saw not a Star, but rather an Angel or beauty of Paradise; For Van∣noza appeared in such an equipage as was capable to make an impression upon
the best fenced heart of a young Cava∣lier principally on one which lay expo∣sed to the airy passions, which make them prefer a shameful slavery before a Glori∣ous liberty. Why should I trouble my self to paint out these follies? He saw and fell, and Vannoza might as justly as Cae∣sar bear the Motto of, Veni, Vidi, Visi, upon her Triumphant Banners. Alcimus was not so much a novice but he knew the Language of his own Country, which is that of love, and knew well enough that it signified that he was better be∣loved in that house then he expected, and that the hatred of the Husband was sufficiently balanced by the affection of the Wife; And as love is the onely at∣traction of love, besides so many charms that rendred this beauty recommenda∣ble, he thought himself obliged in ho∣nour to render a reciprocal affection, so that he quickly answer'd her in her own language, which somewhat resembled that of Angels, or rather of Demons, which speak to one another in thoughts, and there needed no Interpreter to make them understand one another; thus passed this first interview. The next day the Sun had scarce begun by bend∣ing
Westward to lengthen the shadows, when Alcimus (whose coming was at∣tended by his faithful Sentinel long be∣fore his approach) returned to his usu∣al practice, to draw in through his Eyes the poyson, not of hatred but of love, a passion more pernicious to his Heart, where he saw her hold up a letter in her hand, with sign to come and receive it at night, which he diligently perform∣ed, with no other company then his va∣lour; see here the first thread of this Web of iniquity which these two Spi∣ders went craftily to weave. This note in few words, discovered Wonders, wonders that are fittest to be veiled in silence, and interred in oblivion; yet why in oblivion? since this paper un∣dertakes to transmit unto posterity the blackest mischiefs, to make them be so far shunned in like occurences, as the Reader shall abhor them by reading this recital: Let us onely say then, that she advertised Alcimus as followeth. Noble Alcimus, I Am not ignorant of the Alarms you re∣ceived from your mouth of your Con∣fessour, nor can you be so of their meaning,
when I tell you 'twas I that caused them: that was the onely means with which love could inspire me to bring about my design of acquainting you with a malady which none else can cure; If this general proposition may be worthy of your answer, you may find means to convey it over the Garden wall, by which I shall understand whether you esteem worthy of acceptance which is intend∣ed onely for your service, and any own satis∣faction. Vannoza. Alcimus was all inflamed by the many fire-bals which the Evil spirit cast into his Soul by means of this crafty woman, and netled to the very Heart with curio∣sity of knowing the effect of this strange adventure, he returned that night, and cast the following letter over the Garden∣wall, where she stood ready to receive it; Fairest Vannoza, I Know not whether I may more justly ex∣tol your worth and ingenuity, or condemn my own stupidity in not perceiving it before, the one being as far beyond the reach of ap∣plause, as the other is beyond that of abhor∣rency; but since you are pleased to make your
goodness as conspicuous as your merits, by pardoning a crime, which a modest offender durst scarce excuse, know, (fair one) that I value your undeserved affection at so high a rate, that my chief study shall be to merit and preserve it with my life and fortunes. My transport is so great at present, that I know not how to express my self further, but shall impatiently attend the blessed revo∣lution of my happy Stars to produce an occasi∣on, in which I may better testifie the ardour of my unbounded Love, and inexpressible gratitude. Alcimus. Mean while the Boutefeu, which sets both Heaven and Earth on a flame, stuck his heart quite full of Arrows; and as it is his unhospitable custome to set that Lodging on fire, which gives him enter∣tainment; he in a short time made a Furnace in the Breast of Alcimus, who feeling the pungency of this new ardour, could find no further repose, but in the meditation of his sweet inquietude; he now accused himself of his former blind∣ness, and it was then that he saw clearly through these Intrigues, and now that the Cataracts were fallen on his eyes, he
thought himself like Harpastus, the only Argus: O God! How presently does a small errour spread it self into an un∣bounded bigness! One spark of evil having seiz'd the Soul, Soon spreads such flames as nothing can controul. The more difficulty and resistance he found in this pursuit, the more was the pleasure of winning the Prizes, as Simpli∣cius his Commands to the contrary, had infinitely whetted the edge of his appe∣tite of returning to his former passages through the street, there being nothing more desired by humane Nature than that which is forbidden. What lawful is does basest seem, Not worth acceptance, or esteem; But what's forbid by Law and Right, We seek with raging appetite. So these obstacles which seemed to stop his carreer (it seeming as impossible to attempt this Sun inveloped in so ma∣ny Clouds, as the true Celestial one) were so many spurs in his sides, to hurry him
head-long upon this dangerous attempt; yet he found this Current of Content∣ment interrupted by a troublesome con∣sideration, which was a suspition, lest this sudden and unexpected gratious in∣vitation were not a bait to some hidden snare that was pitcht for his destructi∣on; and whether the jealousie of the Husband by a secret intelligence with his Wife, had not found out this means to ruine him: So that tormented on one hand by the charm of so many irresisti∣ble attractions, and on the other with the importunity of his distrust (for wic∣ked women are like those Africans, which are said to bewitch and slay those before whom they laugh; or like Apes, whose embraces serve only to smother,) for these Reasons he earnestly desired to be satisfied from whence proceeded this advertisement which Simplicius had gi∣ven him. He went and found this good Man, whom he conjured and intreated to tell him from whence he had received this advice, protesting not to take up a∣ny resentment against the person he should name; not questioning but that it proceeded from the mouth of one that was very desirous of his welfare. Sim∣plicius
unwilling to reveal it, invented all the excuses he could, none of which would content this Gentleman; who protested to retract his Promise, and re∣take his former passages through the streets (which he had already done, with the addition of far worse Errours) for fear of leaving his Honour engaged, and making himself a scorn and laughing∣stock to his Enemies. Simplicius conti∣nued firm in his resolution; but for fear of sending him away angry and discon∣tented, he desired him, to give him time to beg permission of the Person who had informed him; which was agreed to, and the next day came Vannoza (in her usu∣al manner) to renew her antient Com∣plaints, and to tell Simplicius, that Alci∣mus having for some days followed his advice, and kept his Promise, had now renewed his wonted Courses and Car∣reers, with more pride and insolency than before, better accoutred and ac∣companied, and with greater variety of actions, which drove her Husband in∣to desperation, and would at last pro∣voke him into action, which could not but produce some tragical and dismal E∣vent. Simplicius protested to her, that
Alcimus had not the least design upon her, but only stood upon a Punctilio of Honour, scorning to give this advantage to his Adversary, of bragging, that he frighted him out of the publique street: That he was no man to make love to stone walls, who never did it to any wo∣man living, who indeed are living walls; but plaister'd with so unslaked lime, as is easily fired by the Tears of a Lover. All he could say, was, That he was a young Cavalier, and so head-strong, that it was hard for a holy Father to guide him by the Bridle of Religion: That if Capoleon attacque him, he will bring himself in danger of undergoing a great part of the mischief. That her Husbands Passion was as full of injustice, as the o∣ther was of candour and ingenuity in his proceedings. For this (said the subtle Female) I see but one remedy: That is (said the holy Father) to satisfie him in his extreme curio∣sity, which press'd me to tell him whence I had this advice, which I durst not discover without your permission, thinking it unfit to bring you into the quarrel.
Father (said Vannoza) let me alone, for the love of God, to discover it to him, since it is for the charitable saving of his Soul, and I fear not but to find a happy issue, or at least to prevent its ending in so bloody a Catastrophe. For if Alcimus and my Hus∣band should come to blows (which Heaven forbid) our Sex is still exempt from duels, and the most base and barbarous Courages have still some respect for Ladies; so that I fear no prejudice by being made a Party; and I assure my self, that with one word, I should do more with him towards the pluck∣ing from his heart the fruitless hope which flatters and abuseth him, by making him hope for access to an Object, which can never be lawfully acquired, than you can perhaps do, by all your conscientious perswasions. In the mean time, if you please, you may satisfie his Curiosity, that this advice comes from me, and if you please to bring us together, I will in your presence disswade him from his for∣mer actions. That so he may a Med'cine bring, Thence where the Malady did spring. Simplicius from a well-meaning heart,
not only approved, but highly praised this design, being much rejoyced to see the Scorpion's Oyl prepared to cure the sting; and then Vannoza by this means, cutting off all hope, would thereby take away all occasions of his continuance in his fond Amours: He therefore promis'd to confront her with him; that this A∣dam taken in the fact (if I may so say) and convinced in his presence, might seek no further pretexts or palliations to co∣ver his iniquity. And so forward was this good Man in this design, thinking therein to do all things for the best, and believing that all would pass under the Seal of secresie, that he judged this fittest to be done at the very Confessional, which according to common Custome, having two places for the Penitents, and one in the middle for the Confessor, he might thereby more expresly convince the Cri∣minal, himself being present at the Te∣stimony. But (O execrable Invention!) she fearing least her Invention might turn to her own confusion, desired this good Father, that she might a little be∣fore have one moments conference with Alcimus, promising thereby more gently to compose his spirit to an acknowledg∣ment
of his fault, lest being surprized on the sudden, he might fly out into some extravagant recrimination, or positive denial: The good opinion which the Fa∣ther had of this Female Hypocrite, made him approve well of her Poposition; in so much that he appointed a day for this rencounter, before which he told Alcimus, that the relation came from Vannoza her self, which would witness his false pro∣ceedings to his face: Provided she lift up her Veil (said Alcimus) I am confi∣dent you will find hers overspread with blushes, if there remain in her the least quantity of blood: With which words the Conference ended; and they parted till the appointed day of meeting should come. The End of the Second Book.
ALCIMUS AND VANNOZA. LIB. III. THe day being come, Van∣noza having before by a Note advertised Alcimus of her design, they nei∣ther of them failed to meet at the Confessional of the good Father, whose pious inten∣tions to dis-intangle this Clew, did by
this weakness intangle it more than ever; for Vannoza having put him in mind of his promise of letting her predispose the spirit of Alcimus, in order to the bring∣ing him to an acknowledgment of his fault; the good Simplicius; for these pi∣ous considerations, leaving his Tribu∣nal, as if called away by some affairs of these Statues upon their Pedestals, but such Statues as Pigmalion's, for they then found themselves alive, and their Tongues at liberty. Vannoza most prompt to lay hold on this occasion, which she had so long sought for, began first, as followeth: Seigneur Alcimus, You will perhaps won∣der at the many subtleties I have used to at∣tacque you, but Necessity, the Mistress of Invention was furnished with Artifices, which opened me the way. Know then, and assure your self, it was only I, who by means of this holy Father, gave you this false alarm of the imaginary jealousie of my Hus∣band of you, I say, imaginary as to you, for his jealousie being notorious through all the Ci∣ty, I durst not in general terms stile it feign∣ed; but it is so universal, that without pitch∣ing upon you, or any other in particular, it
extends to all the world; he must be a stranger in this Town, who knows not the evil usage which that hath caused me, and my long and close Imprisonment, is a subject of sorrow to all that hear of it; it is natural to the smallest Bird to search about her Cage for a hole to escape from slavery, which I am re∣solv'd to obtain, or lose my life in the at∣tempt, which is but a burthen, wanting my liberty; I know how little worth or merit I have to work the least affection in you, yet have I miseries enough to stir up a pity in your generous Breast, so that what I cannot hope for from your passion, I almost assure my self from your compassion; for this gives so puissant a sentiment to the bravest Courages, that they make it their glory to be that way vanquishd; for this makes their Valour victorious over others miseries, as constancy makes them over their own: For what would become of the miserable and op∣pressed without the assistance of generous Cavaliers of your Quality and Merits. I have therefore cast my eyes upon you as upon a Gentleman full of Honour, to the end that throwing my self at your feet, or into the arms of your pity, in case your goodness prove favourable to my misery, I may by that means find an issue out of my deplorable mis∣fortunes,
before I try the last remedy, which is death. Which to all sufferings an end does give, And makes the most unhappy cease to grieve. This is a Cure which the miserablest Crea∣ture alive may obtain, and then defy the worst of Fortune's strokes: I have here nei∣ther time nor leisure to let you understand the unjust rigours which Capoleon has ex∣ercised against my innocence, and how inso∣lently his cruelty does triumph over my weak∣ness: 'Tis enough to tell you, that I implore your assistance to deliver me from my pre∣sent miseries, by what means you shall think most convenient; and 'tis easie for you to advance this Stratagem, which I have al∣ready invented, having infused into the Soul of your Confessor (a man of a true Mo∣nastick simplicity) a fear of the dreadful e∣vents of Capoleon's fury, which could ne∣ver find entrance into your magnanimous Courage, if it were real; but I assure you, that my Husband does not so much as think of you; or if he either think or speak of you, it is rather with esteem and praise, than
otherwise; and further, I find that he takes a singular pleasure in seeing you on Horse∣back, but imagines not how far I participate with him in it; for the place from whence I behold you is a secret one, frequented by none but my self, and to which I go by private ways, to give this incomparable contentment to my eyes, to behold amidst those noble and gal∣lant Actions, the most compleat and admi∣red Cavalier living. I have (in pursu∣ance of this first impression) made Father Simplicius believe that you pursued me with your Courtship (though convinced how un∣provided I am of graces and attractions ne∣cessary to merit it) and further, that in the street you gave evident testimonies of your love, but this was only to set a more specious co∣lour on my Husbands jealousie. To sum up all, all this design tended only to this sole point of happiness I now possess, (but, alas! with what brevity) to represent unto your view a scantling of miseries, which is so great an alleviation to them, that I never enjoyed a greater happiness amongst all the passages of my life: For, I know by sad experience that nothing so much oppresseth the heart, as not to know where to unload its sorrow; and the most miserable of all griefs, is that which wants a voice for complaints: 'Tis at pre∣sent
to you, Gentle Alcimus, and to that courtesie and generosity, so natural to those of your Rank and Quality, that I now fly for help and advice; and for what succour you shall please to lend unto my pain, what∣soever shall come from your hand shall be highly acceptable; for since your merits and my own inclination have forced me upon a resolution of carrying the love of you along with me to my Grave; I am ready to commit my Person, Fortune, Life, and Ho∣nour to your generous Protection. How could she more openly, or in∣deed immodestly, have explained her self? But who knows not that impudi∣city is always followed by impudence? She concluded her Harangue with such languishing Looks and Tears, as were a∣ble to charm the hardest rock; and Al∣cimus who was not made of Marble, was therewith so lively touched, that he did not question but she spoke sincerely, and took her Discourse for no less than Oracles; and banishing from his spirit all suspition of Treason, and all fear from Capaleon's practices, it was impossi∣ble to see a heart touched with the love of him, and he not labour of the same
distemper, which is a malady sooner blamed than avoided, and which is more easily avoided by flying it's encounters, than healed where it has once taken foot∣ing. Alcimus vanquished with so many cour∣tesies and favours, presently rendred his arms at the feet of the conquerour, and suffering himself as easily as Sampson to be bound and brought to the Mill, he te∣tified his submission by words, which shewed him to be a deeper Student in Rhetorick than Vannoza, and as great a servant to love, offering her for a con∣firmation of this truth, all the service which her commands could impose up∣on his obedience, saying, That to this he was doubly obliged, by the desire of possessing so rich a treasure, and by that of redeeming her from so tedious a cap∣tivity, a thraldome, which extracted pity from the most barbarous hearer: This was to fall insensibly into the net of his dangerous huntress, whose inten∣tions was, That if she had not wrought affection in the heart of this novice in those affairs, to induce him by pity (a specious gate for love to enter at) to car∣ry her away out of that detestable pri∣son,
not questioning but after that she should have graces and charms enough to work the passion of commiseration into that of affection: and though at last she prevailed not so far as to make him her captive, yet would this put an af∣front upon Capoleon, an affront so irrepa∣rable in this Countrey as nothing can wash off but the blood of the offender, so that she intended at once to save her ho∣nour, her life and liberty, and either enjoy her unjust pretensions, or at least discharge her self of the importunity of love or the bonds of marriage. She ho∣ped to secure her honour by making it be believed (a thing easily alledged) that her rape though voluntary, & of her own suggesting, was a forced action, and that Alcimus his passion, which she had be∣fore complained of to Simplicius, had pricked him on to this rash adven∣ture: Her life she thought secure betwixt the arms of a Gentleman more puissant than her husband; and her liberty, how∣ever, secured by this violence; That if Capoleon fell in this quarrel, her marriage∣yoke was thereby broken; if Alcimus, her love was cured by the removal of the object that gave it being, or at worst she
hoped to be restored into the hands of her parents, Capoleon refusing her, after having been polluted and possest by ano∣ther, which every way would free her from servitude: but when she saw Al∣cimus declare himself a lover, and that in so high a degree, with an ingenuity witnessed both by his words and counte∣nance, then taking him for captive, and her self victorious, and hapilpy arrived at the end of her chief pretensions, she saw her self freed from the trouble of coming to further extremities, and that instead of sounding the trumpet and ma∣king open war (which would occasion more noise than advantage to her) she might now go more privately to work, and put crafts and subtilties (the unfor∣tunate source of this infamous passion) in the place of force and violence. Now as women guarded and kept close by jea∣lous husbands, oft work their liberty out of those guards that are set to pre∣vent it, eighter by dazzling their eyes by artifices and cajolleries, or by the bribes of gold and silver, which is more pene∣trating than lightning, so this subtle wo∣man found it the best means to enter∣tain a correspondence with Alcimus, by
his means whose chief study it was to prevent it, by working upon the harm∣less simplicity of this holy Father, and using the Leaves of devotion to conceal the nakedness of her execrable impiety; as she projected so she spoke, and no sooner spoke but it was assented to by this heed∣less bird, who run head long into the nets and bird-lime laid to surprize him: O God! what black crimes do's he submit to, enough to press him down alive into the lower Regions, such as Hell it's self would be troubled to invent, and asto∣nish with horrour to commit: he that said, to him that liveth, and to him that desireth nothing is impossible, knew well the force of this passion the Queen of all the rest; but he that painted it blind was in the right too, for it blindly pre∣cipitates into enormous crimes those that commit themselves unto it's conduct, and such as they would never commit if they gave but any time to considera∣tion; this is a navigation where one sails amongst thousands of rocks, subject to as many storms and tempests, the causes of many dreadful ship-wracks, and as a hunter, violently set upon the sport, pricked on by that heat is carryed in a
full carrier, to such rugged and almost inaccessible wayes, as the very sight of them in cold blood would strike a horror into him; so this passion of love inspires such courage into him whom it has throughly possest, that he dare undertake the hardest enterprize, and to content a brutish and inordinate appetite, will vio∣late all laws divine and humane, and prophane whatever is most holy in earth or heaven. Alcimus thus consented to these unlawful projects, like another Adam in compliance with his Eve, and as Solomon, a far wiser man than himself, gave himself so over to the love of Pa∣gan-women, that they induced him to the worship of what Idols they proposed to him, to all the artificial inventions that the impiously-subtle Vannoza pro∣jected were faithfully (according to the flesh, but faithlessly as to the spirit) ex∣ecuted and accepted by him: And now tell me that Hercules, when governed by women did not spin amongst them, or that Achilles was not so effeminate as to live disguised amongst Ladies, since Al∣cimus, who alwayes before was an Al∣cides Alexicaces, whilest animated by a better Genius, is now so far transformed
that he is rather a breeder than a tamer of Monsters, the first of which was this: He conspired with this crafty woman to deceive the charitable innocence of this good Father, and instead of making him the mediatour for their reconcilia∣tion with God, and to receive from his mouth the law of the most high, as be∣ing the ministring Angel of the Lord of Hosts, they made him the Pandour to their designs, and more then Diabolical Stratagems, without his thoughts or suspition of it. Vannoza advised him to acknowledge that he was formerly enamoured on her, but that he hoped in time, by the assistance of his fatherly advice and wholesome instructions to ef∣face this affection from his soul, confes∣sing himself vanquisht by her presence, and as much recalled to repentance by her reasons, as before overcome by the pleasing force and violence of her beau∣ty: whereupon they invented di∣vers sorts of intelligence, as filthy and abominable, as crafty and secret, where∣by to understand one another by the con∣trary report of the harmless Simplicius; inventions, which I am loth to commit to this Paper, for fear of sullying it with
such a Monopoly of ingrossed mischiefs better kept secret than revealed, least whilest I strive to breed an abhorrency against them, in the Reader, I may give occasion to some ill-qualified ones of imi∣tation, or at least subject of murmur and evil-speaking, and matter of scandal ra∣ther than edification: See here how there is nothing so holy as to resist their sacri∣lege, behold confession changed into confusion by these brutish spirits, whose distemper was grown to so dangerous a malignity, as to turn the antidote into poison, and make that remedy plant new vices which was designed to root out and extirpiate the old ones. Simplicius returning from the business he had pretended, to give leisure to Van∣noza's wholsome instructions to work up∣on Alcimus, retook his Seat of spiritual Judicature, where indeed he found him really converted, or rather metamor∣phosed, but not with a change from God's right hand: For, As Hector still gave all opposers foils, Returning loaded with Achilles spoils;
So he before alwayes brought home the prize Of thousands of admiring beauteous eyes; Conqu'rour, till now th'assault so fierce did prove, He's slav'd and drag'd after triumphant love. And indeed in this as well as in other vices, he that commits sin is slave to it. O Alcimus! how inconsiderate are thy actions! thus to lay snares to intangle thy self in misery; and instead of cancel∣ling and blotting out thy spiritual debts with the blood of thy Saviour, thus to make a contract with death, and paction with the devil: But let us hear his well-fram'd Oration to Simplicius. Father (said he) I beg of God and you a thousand pardons, for having hitherto gone about to deceive you; I was indeed the first my self that was so, by the splendour of a beauty whose puissant sweetness is able to beat down all opposition, and therefore in that subjugation, I thought my self more worthy of excuse than accusation, of pardon than reproach, but now you have turned the Sun into my face, I must surrender up my arms
to truth, whose strength is prevalent over all things, like an impetuous torrent, bearing down all before it. The clouds may for some time intercept, but never extinguish the Sun's rayes, truth may for some time be in∣velloped with the umbrages of divers sub∣tilties, but can never be altogether obscured. You have so well managed your diligent en∣deavours, that finally by confronting me with an irreproachable Witness, you have totally convinced me, but with a happy conviction, since this is a tribunal of clemency and mer∣cy, where even the sin of Judas (of which mine is the image, having so often betrayed the divine bounty by a kiss) is remissible: Did you (Father) but contemplate the beau∣teous cause of so miserable an effect, I am confident as you now think me foolish and in∣considerate, to submit my self to the capti∣vity of the charms of unlawful love, you would then think me stupid and insensible, if before such a fire I should endure without heat or flame; but be pleased to consider that our affections (principally those that are grown inveterate) are not put off so easily as a garment: Would God we could as easily quit our habitudes as our habits, as the pri∣mitive Christians cast all they had, even to their garments, at the Apostle's feet, so I
had presently deposited at yours all the passion that I had for this Lady. But I pray consi∣der, (which you know better than I) how hard it is for the Aethiopian to change his co∣lour, or the Leopard his spots, but still more for a sinner so suddainly to rid himself of that which is so deeply ingraved in his soul; I hope, nevertheless, by the grace of God and the assistance of your Prayers and good Con∣duct, to draw this thorn out of my heart, which I once took for a most pretious and fra∣grant rose, the impressions of which will hardly yet be effaced from my spirit, though I feel sufficiently the pungency of it, so that I now find how rational that saying was, I see what's good, but my malignant will Bends me to love and follow what is ill. Though this will be the very separation of my soul from my body by so violent an effort, yet when it shall please God to break these fatal bonds of iniquity which environ me, I will sacrifice to him an hecatomb of praises, and every where publish the glory of his name: All I can at present do is to protest, that for the future I will do my best endeavour to efface
out of my memory the Idea of so many graces and perfections that have enchanted it, and essay to shut the gate against those thoughts which nourish my passions; and finally, to take that resolution which is incident to the most irresolute, to hope no further where the evil is incurable; I say not this because mine is so, but I see by the firmness of this Lady that she is no less chast than fair; and if she have attractions which make her be beloved, she has no less severity to make her be feared, and all attempts are fruitless upon one so firmly bent upon the conserva∣tion of her honour: I will henceforth endea∣vour to extinguish my unlawful fire with the tears of penitence; and seeing the waxed wings of my designs melted by so audacious an approach, I will like Icarus drown them in that Sea of repentance: It is fit I banish from my spirit those Idaea's which flattered my passion, and withal seemed so delicious; for instead of the contentment, which I promi∣sed my self from their success, I now see no∣thing attend me but sorrow and regrets. Upon sound advice I find my self obliged, rather to commend her vertuous resolution, than to blame unjustly her holy rigour, which now has proved the onely eye-water to restore the sight, I have been so long
deprived of: And since she cannot be piti∣ful to me, but by being cruel to her self; nor satisfie my humour but at the expence of her Honour, I shall shew far more judgment in making my retreat, than I did in beginning my enterprize. And I heartily bless God, that having fallen, it is into such hands, hers and yours, by whose assistance I cannot fear but to obtain a recovery and making profit of my misfortune, have cause to say, it was good for me to have this fall, af∣ter which I hope to stand faster than be∣fore. Judge now by this Discourse whether the Children of Darkness be not more in their perverse generation, than those of the light, and whether they be not more witty, prudent, and discreet, and wsthal more accomplishd for the bring∣ing about their wicked designs; Was not this cajollery able to pass, not only upon the innocency of the well-meaning Sim∣plicius, but even upon the cratiest in the world? This good Father reply'd, My Son, 'tis a good step towards health to be cured; though you come somewhat late to repentance, yet all is soon enough, if well enough: I told you before, that
all that smoke could not be without some fire, and that your Mine would at last be discovered, though never so se∣cretly wrought: But now, God be praised, who has melted the Ice of your obstinacy by the Sun of truth, and that the acknowledgment of your fore-past fault, promiseth us a future amend∣ment; and that which does most re∣joyce me, is to see you hope in the Di∣vine Mercy, which is an Abyss without bounds or bottom, and will not let us want that, which it would have extend∣ed even unto Judas, had he not prevent∣ed it by despair, to which the extremi∣ty of his grief reduced him: He who begg'd pardon for his Crucifiers, will surely do the same for those who with a sincere heart do now invoke his boun∣ty, whilst he is in the Throne of Glo∣ry, performing the Office of our Advo∣cate. And after turning towards Vannoza (which heard all this Mystery with that attentation and joy, which you may well magine possest her, to see her designs suc∣ceed so happily.) You see (Madam, said he) our Cri∣minal convinced by his own Confessi∣on;
What now rests but to condemn him not to punishment but amendment. It is true, we are here in a Tribunal, where a free Confession serves for an excuse, and where excusing aggravates the Crime. A Tribunal where Mercy has predominance over Judgment, and where there needs only a sound Confes∣sion of a fault to obtain remission, since here we hold the place of him who hath said, At what time soever a sinner return∣eth towards me, my arms shall be open to receive him, for I am the living God, who would not the death of a sinner, but ra∣ther that he should turn from his iniquity and live: If Wine, Women, and Truth, are asunder judged in Scripture to be the three strongest things in the world, what must they needs be, when united in one Subject? We have here the Wine of Charity, and Divine Love, washing away the filthy putrefaction of this prophane Passion: You, Madam, are that strong Woman, which Solomon desireth, whose price is above Rubies, or the precious things the world can yield; and have by your fortitude reduced to Rea∣son this wandring Soul, by repelling all his assaults: But above all, the
Strength of Truth is greatest, for you see that Alcimus confounded by the first Ray that it darted in his face. To this Vannoza replied, in the Apo∣stle's Phrase, (for she wanted neither wit, nor words to express it, had she but had Grace to apply it better.) Not I (Father) but the Grace of God in me, the Grace of God which often makes use of the weakest things to confound the strongest; of a Rod to tame the pride of the Aegyptians, and of the hand of a woman to behead the great Assyrian Captain. But, Father, to strike now whilst the Iron's hot, what hin∣ders, but that (as the Ennuch of Candace was presently baptized by St. Philip) you now speedily restore to him that Grace of which he had deprived himself by his bad de∣signs. The Passion with which Alcimus has hitherto been custamed is such, that if violence be not used to pluck it from his Soul, he will continue in his sin, I in pain, and my Husband in his evil humour. You say very well, Daughter (said the good Simplicius) for since the hour of death is so uncertain, why should he delay converting himself to God, who hath promis'd him, as saith the glorious Father St. Angustine, to receive him to
mercy every moment, but has not as∣sured him to allow him space till death, to cry him mercy. It being but just; that that sinner should forget himself in death, who hath never thought of God through all the course of his life. What think you of this, continued he, (my Son Alcimus) the Grace of God hates delays, and he that presents it you to day, has not promised to do so to mor∣row; if you put your self amongst the foolish Virgins, you must expect to hear that sad Sentence in the Day of Judg∣ment, Depart from me. I know you not: Will you by the impenitent perseve∣rance of a wicked heart, treasure up wrath against the day of wrath? Will you be silent when you ought to speak, and be deaf to the Voice of God, who calls on you by me? the Voice of the Turtle, which summons you to a forsa∣king of your disordinate and irregular Passions. Woe unto you if you keep silence: There is a time to be silent, and a time to speak: It is a Malignant Devil, which makes us deaf to the Re∣monstrances, and dumb to the Confessi∣on of our sins, from which I beseech God to deliver you; I perceive you are
in danger to defer your repentance a while, during which time the Devil will return with greater fury to recover the prey which grace has almost snatcht out of his clutches, and if he make himself once stronger and better armed in the fortress of your heart, it is to be feared he will guard it so strongly as to keep out the holy Spirit, and so your last er∣rour will be worse than the first: Con∣sider that it is humane frailty to fall, but diabolical madness to persevere: Is it fit to consult, hang backwards, or deliberate, when you are summoned to render your self to God, and to quit the creature for the Creator, to whom none is like, than whom none is strong∣er, whom none can resist, nor any en∣ter into comparison with i Almigh∣ty Majesty. Vannoza, hearing this Discourse, back∣ed by the vehemence of that charity which animated this good Father, who wrought upon his stoney heart, as if he had been exercising one possest, and fear∣ing that the efficatious strength of this word Which converteth Souls, uttered with such a vehemency of spirit, should shake those yet but feeble roots which
she had planted in the heart of this Neo∣phite, to obstruct his spiritual resurre∣ction; Alas! (said she) Father, in this new springing of his fault, you must not press too hard upon his heart least you oppress it: The gentle West-wind that makes the Flowers spring is sweet and fragrant, but the impetuosity of the North pincheth and destroys them: The first condescention which I found in him makes me not doubt of a second, but to this end, time must give assist∣ance unto reason; Your Maximes, doubtless, are good and prevalent, but be the Medicines never so wholsome and well compounded, yet are they not alwaies efficatious, if there be not a fit disposition in the patient that receves them: It is to be thought that Alcimus his Apostume is not yet ripe, because it is still unbroken, the time will come, when like a good Tree, planted by the streams of Grace, he will bring forth Fruit in due season. I know he now perceives at last The folly of his Errours past, And in short time I hope see His Flames to Ice will changed he.
I conceive (with submission to your better counsel) it is fit to give him re∣spite as to a bad pay-Master, that if his levity should bring him to return unto his vomit, it may take from him all excuse of having had too short a time to resolve, and to pluck up by reason and the force of arguments, a passi∣on which has so long rooted in his breast. Simplicius, easie to work on, as a true Monastick, who thought that all the World, like him, proceeded in their actions with charity and sincerity, gave his hand to this female-councel, which he thought fit to be sometimes followed, and sometimes not, and that Adam and Pilate were equally guilty the one for following and the other for rejecting the the Counsel of a Woman: Thus was Alcimus ballanced on the one side with Divine Love, and with Humane on the other, and at last suffered himself to be weighed down by the later, directly to∣wards Hell and Destruction. I will not trouble my self nor the Rea∣der with a Discovery of the progress and success of the artifices used in this un∣fortunate infection (I would say affecti∣on,
but have spoken more properly then I intended) nor declare in what manner these two impious Lovers abused the in∣nocence of this good man to maintain an intelligence betwixt them. Some∣times Alcimus making him believe that he could not, or at least not so soon, rid himself of this passion; sometimes Van∣noza continuing her false complaints, and feigned fears, whereby they made this holy Father their Shuttle-cock, and through their joynt and deceitful pro∣positions, be entred into such real ap∣prehensions of the loss either of the Soul or Body of Alcimus, that it robbed him of his rest, and his trouble brought him to a pining leanness: In this Spiritual Cure he resembled those Physitians, who not well understanding a Distemper, take care of one part of it, whilest the other part destroyes the Patient: And as those Corporal Physitians know not the Disposition of the Interiour parts but from the relation of the Patient, so these Spiritual ones, know them not but by the report of the penitent, which made the Philosopher say to a young man, Speak that I may see thee; and as the eye being single, the whole body is thereby con∣ducted,
by the aid of an amiable light, so contrarily, he walks in darkness whose eyes are clouded; and how should our Spiritual Guides conduct us rightly through a holy discipline, if we do not truly and sincerely discover our selves to them, without disguising and deceit; for which cause the wise man declareth that the Heart is deceitful above all things, and a double Tongue is an abo∣mination before God: I will not here make register of the execrable subtleties of these fire-brands of Hell, of explain∣ing themselves to one another by an in∣nocent Interpreter, of whom one may say, as David did of the Patriarch Jo∣seph, That he heard a Language which he had no understanding of; but is the fault in the Sword if one commit Murther with it? or of a Sacrament if many abuse it? Who knows not the corrupt Sto∣machs turn the best Meat into Crudities? Besides all this, the counter-sence of their words as well in Speech as Wri∣ting; their cabalistique Cyphers, and interlined Letters, written by a Liquor, which of invisible became visible by be∣ing held against the Fire, and by such like means; and many other wayes,
whereby they dayly maintained their wicked correspondence, by abusing in so many several manners the goodness of this religious person, who was there∣by tost like a Ball betwixt two skilful Gamesters. But if the wicked devices and odious sins which were acted in the Temple and in holy places by the Sons of Aaron and of Eli were so severely punisht by Divine Vengeance, what punishment was due to these sacrilegious persons, who not con∣tent to violate a Sacrament, which is great and honourable, and by an infa∣mous Adultery projected and acted by them, but also this other holy one, which pronounceth on Earth the Decrees of Heaven, miserably changing into a crime, that which ought to serve them for an instruction of justification; How oft, like Uriah, did they carry in their own Bosoms the sealed Packets of their condemnati∣on, but with as much wickedness and deceit as he had of ignorance and inno∣cence. But this sort of Writing and Speaking was not all, the furious passion which so tormented them, and robbed them of their repose was not an evil that could be
healed so, without coming to an effect, (their reciprocal being but too well desires known to one another) that old Serpent the Devil, Who hath so many names, but more de∣vices, With which to mischief Sinners he en∣tices. He, I say, failed not to suggest unto them many means of seeing one another, and that in such a manner as they desired; for though in this sort of Vice, the Gos∣pel places the mental Adultry in a lust∣ful look, and a determinate mind to do evil, yet the execution is not perfected by the view, though these, like those of the Basilisk, strike death into the Soul; the life of which consisteth in Grace, which is lost by a mortal coveting. Alcimus being assured of Vannoza's good, will (to him, but evil in its self) did soon find the way (were it by the means of some friends, or rather the ir∣resistable force of his Coin) to procure access to a house that joined to Capoleon's, where by the conjunction of the roofs, he facilitated his entrance to the Cabi∣net
of Meditations of her, who easily wai∣ved her devotion, to yield her self to his: There whilest her Husband thought her taken up with Celestial Contemplations, she was exercised altogether in Earthly ones, and in the possession of her new Lover: Thus was this immodest Helena taken for a chaste Hecuba. And thus these passionate Lovers being arrived to the top of their pretensions, in the en∣joyment of their delights, as execrable as unjust, thought they had found out the Elyzian Fields in this Garret: But the pleasure of the wicked passeth in an instant; and the Royal Prophet hath de∣clared, That he hath seen the wicked eleva∣ted above the Cedars of Lebanon (which are the just and perfect Souls); and soon after repassing by the same Thickets, he has no longer perceived them, because they were shrunk away and failed; for as the wax melteth before the fire, and the smoke dissipateth and vanisheth as it riseth higher, so Sinners are brought to nought in God's presence, in an instant: This intercourse lasted but a while, for these often frequentings of this house being observed by the Master of it, (who was not at all advertised of the reasons
of them, all the business being brought about by one of his Servants, corrupted by Alcimus) it presently buzzed suspi∣tion into his head, (a Vice natural unto the Italians) and made him begin to look after the honour of his Wife, who was rather capable to beget pity than desire: See here an eclipse, and parenthesis for some days to the interviews of our Lo∣vers. Thus crosses do in multitudes descend On those who 'gainst Gods righteous Laws offend: But they like Mules and Beasts, quite void of sence, Feel not the rod, nor turn from their offence. But the same spirit of darkness that ani∣mated them, being as fertile in inven∣tion as perswasive in wickedness, to make them a passage through all the steps and degrees that lead to the highest top of iniquity, suggested to them more of his Diabolick ways; Diabolick do I say! nay much worse than the artifices of Devils, who are forced to confess their impuissance in sacred places, which our
wicked ones chose to make the execrable Theatre of their abominations; whence comes it (saith God by the mouth of a Prophet) that they whom I loved have committed such crimes in my own house? And if a fault which of it self is but venial, or slightly punishable, be∣comes inexpiable, et crimen lesae Ma∣jestatis, when acted in a Kings Palace, as being a place of veneration, and not to be dishonoured by an infamous act, what new punishment must there be invented to inflict upon him who violates the Temple of the Immortal and Invisible King of Kings, by detestable prophanati∣ons; Of a certainty God will not hold for innocent him that pollutes the place of his abode, and make that which is consecrated for a House of Prayer, be converted into a Den of Thieves. Within this House, Lord, nought is fit to be, But what in holiness resembles thee. Vannoza having no liberty to go a∣broad, but to holy places in the company of her Mother, Alcimus by an act doubly sacrilegious, still frequented those Mo∣nasteries
where there were to be Stati∣ons, Indulgences, or Processions of the Fraternities, and there habited like the Religious of every several Monastery and Order where he was, he hid himself in some private Chappels, or secret and dark retiring places, (as those who do evil, hate the light) and was there visited by his devout Mistress, where under pre∣tence of Consolation, Instruction or Con∣fession, they acted that which could scarce find remission from him who was thereby so highly dishonoured in his own habitation: I am struck with horrour to discover deeds of so black a hue; but it is to stamp some horrour in the Souls of those who act or are tempted to com∣mit the like, that I trace these lines upon this paper. Those who know the dexterity and boldness of the Italian spirits, principal∣ly when they are pricked forwards by this frantick passion which hath so puis∣sant a dominion in their hearts, will not find these horrid impudencies strange, though to others of another Nation they may seem almost incredible. Now as in the course of perfection, it is the custome of those who use them∣selves
to it, to advance from virtue to virtue, till by degrees they arrive at the top of the Coelestial Olympus, so are there steps and degrees in evil; and though (as an Ancient saith) there is no vice but what brings us to the brink of a Preci∣pice, yet another saith as truly, None highly good can in one moment be Hurry'd into the worst impiety. None from the top of Virtue in a trice Plungeth into the lowest depth of Vice. And though this seem to be the last period of it, when a celestial Cloak is fitted to infernal actions, this I say, may well be thought the Hercules Pillars, beyond which, wickedness can scarce pass any further. Yet our Criminals found this way so environed with thorns, their en∣counters so perillous, their interviews so short, and their conversations so in∣commodious, that though the Roses of this Passion seem not delicious, but a∣mongst such picquant difficulties, yet they soon left their tract of iniquity, be∣because having experimented one be∣fore, more easie, and more accommoda∣ted to their gust, it seemed to them as
hazardous, as it was in it self horrible and impious: For, besides that the dis∣covery of this Stratagem would expose them to publick infamy, and make them hated and hiss'd at by all, as the God of War and the Black-smiths Wise amongst the adulterous Poetical gods, were in the invisible snares; It further seemed, that humane Justice would hardly in∣vent a punishment suitably rigorous to so enormous a Crime: Their next recourse was therefore to a Ladder, which Alci∣mus having procured to be made of silk, and as secretly delivered it to Vannoza in one of their private Monastick meetings, which she in the night, at the appointed hour, fastened to the Window of the room of her pretended Devotion, and cast down the other end to the ground, where by his activity readily getting over the Walls of the Court-yard, easily mounted to the highest Pinacle of his in∣tended happiness, without fearing a Pre∣cipice into the horrible depths of destru∣ction, any more than that of his body up∣on the Pavement, not thinking of the former, since he could escape the later by his strength and nimbleness.
No wonder if Vannoza pleased her self in her private Chappel, which she had builded on the top of her house, since there, like Micah, she kept her hidden I∣dol, and instead of burying it at the foot of the Oak of Sichem (as Jacob did those of his family) by a sound repentance, she sacrificed to it (but this word is too ho∣nourable for so dishonest an action) I may more properly term it a prostitution of her Affections, Soul, and Honour. And if Covetousness be called Idolatry, and Gluttons are said to make a God of their Belly, how much more fitly may we term sensual Persons, Idolaters; who seem to acknowledge no other Divini∣ty, than the object of their filthy de∣sires; like unclean Beasts, wallowing in the mire, loosely abandoning the Ser∣vice of the Creator (who is the sole disposer of infinite Delectations) for that of a vile and wretched Creature; for as he that adheres to God, becomes of the same Spirit with him; so he that sticks unto a loose Woman, becomes a Mem∣ber of her Body, and of the same sub∣stance; so that they resemble two Cap∣tives, who by one Chain are conducted
to the eternal Gaoles, unless their re∣pentance prevent their Condemnation. But this practice, as perillous as un∣happy, was not long without interrupti∣on, according to the saying of the Poet, Those whom the highest joys do bless, Abide not long in happiness: The World, like th' Ocean, ne're's secure; A peaceful Calm can't long endure: Felicity ne're rests long in one place, And Fortune's Wheel moves not a measur'd pace. Besides their continual fears (the inse∣parable scourge of the wicked) and the apprehensions not only of being surpri∣zed in the act, but of being espied by some Passengers in the street, their Con∣sciences were still plagued with a thou∣sand remorses. Alcimus always went in the night to the abode of this deceitful Siren, alone and armed, resolved to set upon the first that should interrupt his designs, but it being impossible for him to mount the Ladder with so many Arms as he carried, in quitting them, which he left at the bot∣tom,
he was seized always with a fear of being surprized thus unarmed, so that that of the Sacred Pages might justly be applied to him, Combats without, and Ter∣rours within. But if affection sharpen the understanding, how was it possible for him to continue blind amongst so many perils as on all parts invironed him? How should it be, but that like Balaam, he should perceive the flaming Sword of Divine Justice waved over his head, and ready to divide it asunder: But it is in vain for us to desire he should avoid that mis∣chief he so earnestly pursues. The rea∣son of this is well expressed in these words of the Royal Prophet, The fire is fallen, and they have not seen the Sun; for when the flames of desire tyrannize in their Souls, the light of their eye (that is, their Reason) remains no longer with them, and the faculties of it quite forsake them. The jealous in the excess of their love, have this property, to be always suspici∣ous, and consequently fearful, and even then, when they have least subject for it; 'Tis this that banisheth repose from their eye-lids, and causes that the juyce of Poppy, which night sheds upon the
earth, cannot infuse sleep into their eyes; they are always waking, or rather awaking, and the ear, chiefly in the dark, is always open to the least noise; so that though these two used all means imagi∣nable to be neither seen nor heard, yet walking in darkness, or in the Scripture Phrase, groping by the wall, and in eleva∣ted places, whose Symmetry was less di∣scernible than the rest of the Building, it was impossible but that they must make some noise or sound, which would easily reach a watchful ear. Vannoza had oft been advertised of this by Capoleon, who was troubled that his Wife usually spent a great part of the night in this Garret, in the conversation of the wandring Ghosts and Goblins of the night, thinking her Devotion had by this time brought her into the Visions of St. Anthony or of St. Macarius, and that the Demons strove to interrupt her Prayers. Vannoza sometimes told him it was nothing, and that she was not so good as he supposed, or she desired; that she was neither in so profound Contemplations, nor such deep Extasies, to give occasion to the Angels of Darkness to envy her Piety, or in∣terrupt it by Apparitions or Illusions.
Otherwhiles she made him some crafty excuses, alledging, that during the si∣lence of the night, the least noise seem∣eth great; that there are certain Ani∣mals which stir not abroad but in the dark, principally on the tops of houses, and alwayes make a rattling and a noise; that if she had been of a timerous hu∣mour, her solitude had administred cau∣ses enough of fear; avowing to him that she had often seen Fantomes in different fashions, but that she attributed it to the interruption of her spirits, or the weak∣ness of her sight, amongst the shades of night rather than to her vertue or piety. (As if these visits of Satan were marks of the grand merits of such his impious servants.) O Vannoza! remember that God is not thus mocked with impurity, that if his long suffering wink at thee for a time, till thou arrive to such a height of wickedness, it is but for thee to take the greater fall. The old man prepossest with a good opinion of the chastity of his wife, took her for a Saint, and all she said for Oracles; with which Alcimus and she made excel∣lent past-time, it furnishing them suffi∣ciently with laughter. One night amongst
the rest, whilest they continued their entertainments and embraces longer then ordinary, Capoleon, like another Pompi∣lius, attending the descent of the Nymph Egeria, at length wearied, and opprest with drowsiness, fell asleep, and so in a Dream, which brought him into the Countrey near the Appennine, where he thought a Bear coming from the Moun∣tains, bereaved him of his Wife, and tearing her out of his Arms, carry∣ed her into his Den, where, without hurting her, he nourisht her with Apples and other Fruit, of which he had laid in great store, where helplessly he beheld her embraced by this Savage-Monster; and being in an inexplicable perplexity how he should recover his Vannoza from the power of this fierce Animal, as it ordinarily happens to those who are so afflicted in their sleep, he wakened, over∣joy'd that this Misfortune was imagina∣ry, though indeed it was but too real: Therefore groping round about, to find if his better half were with him, and missing her, fearing least this Dream might be a presage of some tragical di∣saster, he leapt out of the Bed, and run∣ning up Stairs to Vannoza's Oratory,
he knocked at the Door, at the same time when she was in the possession of a Bear in humane shape. This knocking seem'd to be her knell, expecting no∣thing less than death from her injured Husband; And Alcimus thinking him∣self betrayed, resolved to sell his life at the highest rate his Valour could put upon it: at last Vannoza, not quite de∣spairing of an escape by the assistance of the darkness, advised him to slip under the Bed; and she, feigning her self to be asleep, let Capoleon knock a little longer, and after starting up as if affrighted out of sleep, she asked who it was that came to interrupt her in the midst of her repose: Capoleon praising God that she was there & safe, recounted to her his Dream from point to point: To the inter∣pretation of which they needed to consult neither Morpheus nor Artemidorus, for Alcimus and Vannoza could do it better than either, but knew not whether it gave them more reason of fear or laugh∣ter: Capoleon telling her he was come to succour her, and desiring her to open the Door, she knew not whether to take it in jeft or earnest, fearing all this but an invention and counterfeit pleasant∣ness
in order to her destruction, the con∣science of her and that of her Lover, beating up a thousand dreadful alarms; At last, taking courage from the extre∣mity of danger, My Dear, said she, know'st thou not that Dreams are but lyes and de∣lusions? I wonder that you being so wise a man, should trouble your self with these superstitions, which you would blame in the weakest Woman; pray return to your rest; I thank you however for your succour, though it be more importunate than opportune; I am in the little Bed which I have placed in this Room, where pray let me alone this night: Capoleon notwithstanding urging her to open it, protesting that he could not sleep without her amidst this inquie∣tude, she judging by his voice that he was in earnest, but without any emoti∣on of choller, prayed him to stay a while till she were a little cloathed to go with him, for that Bed was too strait for them both (too strait indeed for the Husband and Adulterer.) This while she consulted with Alcimus for his escape, who to put himself in posture for defence or flight as he should see most convenient, (fearing least if by some sinister accident he should be found under the Bed, it might cost
him his life before he could get up) thought it fittest to get behind the door, which was no sooner open but Capoleon, taking Vannoza by the hand, led her away to his Chamber in the dark, here∣by making them both an honourable amends for the fright and trouble he had put them to: Alcimus now had time to clothe himself and escape, applauding in himself the wit and courage of Vanno∣za, and blessing the good fortune that attends on Lovers, Instead of acknow∣ledging (wretched as he was) the infi∣nite bounty and goodness of God, who by this hazzard he had run (the greatest imaginable) gave him fair admonition to renounce his abominable wickedness and impiety, and by thus shewing him the rod, would fright him into an amend∣ment. But alas! his depraved spirit and impenitent heart, instead of repenting for what was past, and amending for the future, strove rather to imitate the Ma∣riner, who having escaped the fury of a Tempest, which threatned him with manifest Ship-wrack, hath scarce dryed his Cloathes before he is so weary of Land that he is fired with impatience and desire of imbarking for another Na∣vigation,
to try his fortune the second time: As for Vannoza, her wickedness whetting her invention, and sharpen∣ing her industry, she made her husband (whom she saw besotted with love of her) believe what she pleased, telling him, That after some exercises of mortifica∣tion, which without naming he was suf∣ficiently satisfied of, finding her self wea∣ryed, and her spirits weakened and dul∣led, she was constrained to go to rest, being of opinion, that after having chastned her body and brought it into servitude, it was not fitting presently to restore it to delights betwixt the arms of her husband, whom at the same time she sweetned with many feigned cares∣ses: Thus this false Female, the more sweetly she flattered him, the more deep∣ly she deceived him: This brings into my memory the saying of Uriah to Da∣vid, That he could not allow himself to take his ease and pleasures in the bed of his wife, whilest his Captain Joab was armed in his pavilions: Thus ended this Adventure, which served but for a whet-stone to sharpen their infamous desires and brutish appetites; The remembrance of a danger vanished with it, and being
once in safety, we forget who set us there; Benefits we write on a wave, But Injuries in brass engrave. They renewed their intercourse when the shades of Night rendred all things in∣visible; but they forgot that Night has eyes, Night's beauteous eyes, the Stars do pierce The Shades which veil the Universe. Not to mention the great eye of the Divinity, which cannot be clouded by the thickest darkness, since God is all light, and nothing is hid from him: This universal sight, which gave him the Name of God, according to the Greek, sees through the Walls of Hea∣ven, and without being perceived, plainly beholds and orders the Influence of the Stars and Coelestial Bodies, and sees not onely the Actions which are hid from Men, but even the Thoughts, and those very Faults which are unknown to them who commit them; This drew
from the mouth of the Divine Singer these words which suit so fitly to our pur∣pose: Vain were my hopes, to think the veil of night Could hide my secret actions from thy sight; Night, even then, has eyes to six on me; What's dark to us, Lord, is not so to thee, Who canst turn night to day, Or make noon mid-night be. For as to save Israel, God made use of thick darkness at noon-day, so to disco∣ver the wicked actions of the despisers of his Justice, and abusers of his Mercy, he can make day in the midst of night, laying open to the light the works that are wrought in darkness: This he brought about here by a way as strange as that, by which he caused the heads of Goliah and Holofernes to be cut off by their own Swords. Alcimus his Servants seeing him so of∣ten go out of the house, to pass away part of the night abroad, in the equi∣page
of one that goes on no good design, being alone and unattended, as being un∣willing to have any witness of his acti∣ons, had cause enough to conjecture, that he went to those Thefts, which are now as much esteemed in the world, as others were formerly amongst the Lace∣demonians; but they were in continu∣al apprehensions lest some mischief should befal him, as it ordinarily happens to the defilers of another's Bed; but he had strictly forbidden them to follow him, upon pain of his displeasure, and ca∣shiering them from his Service; so that they were forced to let him run alone af∣ter the desires of his heart; but his Parents being advertised of it (to whom this only Son was dearer than the apples of their eyes) made him be so well watch∣ed by one of their most trusty Dome∣sticks, that at last this subtle Hunter took him on the Seat, and saw a new kind of Angel ascend and descend a Lad∣der, which was quite contrary to that of Jacob, that reaching unto Heaven, but this to Hell: Yet was it better for Alci∣mus to be discovered by those who desi∣red the the safety of his Soul as well as Body, than by a jealous Husband, who
taking him in the act, would have sacri∣ficed both to his fury. But it was ne∣cessary for this head-strong young sin∣ner to be more severely chastised than by a Fatherly Remonstrance, to turn him from his evil courses and bad designs, which happened in the manner follow∣ing: This Servant of Alcimus his Fa∣ther, who by his craft had traced out the haunts of this untamed young Cour∣ser, not having on his lips the Seal of si∣lence, which Alexander fixed upon those of Ephestion, having advertised some of Alcimus his Servants, that they should take care of their Master, and that not∣withstanding his Commands to the con∣trary, they ought to follow him afar off, for fear lest some disaster should befal him for want of succour; they who desi∣red nothing more than the conservation of him, on whom their fortunes de∣pended, quickly accorded to this Pro∣position; but it was fit that their eyes should make them certain of what they yet knew nothing of, but by the ear; which having done, and no longer doubting of the certainty of it; it hap∣pened that one night having followed him afar off, and seeing him stop, they
made a stand, and there see him mount his Ladder, whilest they as his Corps de Garde, stood Sentinel, and made their Rounds about the street, he having left his Ladder hanging at the Window (as usually it did) to attend his return: Mean while it fell out that a Party of Sbirres (who are Sergeants and Officers of Justice in that Country) who came from the search of some Robbers, meeting these Persons in the street, ex∣amin'd them, what business detained them so long out of their Lodgings, ask∣ing them their names, their quality, and abode, and going at the same time to seize on some of them, who gave saucy and abusive answers to their interroga∣tories, there were presently Swords drawn, blows dealt lustily about, Har∣quebusses lustily fired (the ordinary Arms of these Sbirres) a great Cry made, and the Alarm hotly given in that Quarter, some crying out Thieves, some Fire, some Murther, and all was in an uproar, Peo∣ple flocked out of their houses to see what the matter was, and the street was so full of lights, that it seemed to be ra∣ther day than night; the Inhabitants as∣sembled from all parts, and Capoleon's
Servants went out among the rest; Ca∣poleon himself leaped out of Bed (every one being concerned at a Cry of Thieves or Fire) This Gentleman being one of the Chief men of that Quarter, all flock∣ed about him, and before his house, where the Ladder hung for a Scalado. Whilst these confused Cries, Blows, and Wounds made all speakers & no hearers, the noise came to the top of the House, where our two solitary Sparrows were lodged: Alcimus leaping up, run to the Window (after having habited him∣self as well as possible on the sudden) and was going to go down by his Ladder. Good God! what an amazing sight was it for him to see all the street and Court full of people, which stood thickest a∣bout the bottom of his Ladder: Some seized on the Arms he had left below, others were coming to search for Thieves in Capoleon's house; some were complaining of their Wounds, others laying hold on the Prisoners; and final∣ly, all was a Chaos of Disorders. I have no leisure to describe the fright and ter∣rour of Vannoza, who ran down to her Husbands Chamber, as if she had been going to execution, or descending alive
into the Sepulchre; for what could she promise to her self but certain death, and the hour of her punishment to be alrea∣dy come? Alcimus having nothing for his defence but a Pistol and a Dagger, re∣solved to run down the stairs of the House, and resolutely to rush through the press, which he did with more reso∣lution than consideration; and at the bot∣tom of the Stairs meeting a Servant of the house, which begun to cry out Thieves, he pulling his hat over his eyes, to avoid being known, fired his Pistol so near his face, that the other holding up his arm to avoid the blow, had it shot through with a Bullet, and his eyes so dazled with the smoke and fire, that that, and the fright he was in, made him fan∣cie as many Thieves as sparks: the report amazed all the hearers, and he run∣ning to the Gate, gave the first he met so rude a salute with his Poniard, as put him into a necessity of saving himself, rather than seizing him; he prest for∣wards, pushing one, and striking ano∣ther, and crying out, Here, here, my fel∣lows, now's the fittest time to make our way with our Swords and Pistols; which frighted both the Sergeants, and all the
Company into a belief that there were many of them, and that they should find sharp service in attacquing such despe∣rate Villains, so that their terrour putting them all to flight, he fled and sa∣ved himself pell-mell amongst the rest, without ever being known or taken notice of Vannoza knowing no∣thing of all this, and hearing nothing but blows and crys, fancied her self already torn in pieces, and attend∣ed nothing but her death; she knew that in that Country 'twas in vain to ask par∣don of a Husband for faults like hers; these Offences like Treason against Prin∣ces, are not washt away but with the blood of the guilty, the spot; like that of Oyl, not being to be taken out but with the piece; and as it is imprinted in humane nature, to endeavour to prolong it as long as they can, she run down in∣to the Cellar to hide her self, as if she were willing to go alive to Hell, rather than suffer the pains of death; or like a Criminal Vestal, be put alive into the pit, as a punishment fit for her unclean∣ness. Here she might justly say, as the Reprobates will at the Day of the Uni∣versal Assizes, Mountains fall upon us:
with her as with a Traveller, who being in open Fields in a Tempest, sees the Hea∣vens all on fire with Lightning, hears the Air resounding with Thunder, sees the Earth washed with the Rain, and beaten by the Hail, and fearing so many Ar∣rows and Instruments of Death bent a∣gainst his head, betakes himself to the shelter of a well-spread Tree, or secret Grot; but if a Thunder-bolt come to tear the Earth from under his feet, think but what fright he now endures this moment, which he takes for the last of his whole life; such was the dreadful fright of Vannoza, too happy Vannoza, had she made use of these Rods of God's Fa∣therly correction, and if by the fear of God's Judgments, she had been frighted into Goodness: But God might well work Prodigies by the Rod of Moses, it nothing abates Pharaoh's courage; there are some Souls are so depraved, that like Tigres, they grow more fierce by gentle usage. Lord, with how many pleasant ingredients of mercy dost thou temper the bitterness of thy Potion of Justice! How many warnings dost thou give to them, who amidst their Sins have not quite lost the sense of thy fear, to make
them hide themselves by penitence from the Arrows of thy fierce wrath! This action of Vannoza's hiding her self, puts me in mind of that of Adam, after he had tasted the forbidden fruit. And further (which is nearer to our purpose) of that of Helen, so exactly described by the Prince of Poets, when at the Sack of Troy Aeneas espyed her hid in the Tem∣ple of Vesta, for fear of being involved in the general Ruine; the words, co∣ming from this Noble Genius are excel∣lent, and worthy the Recital. -Limina vestae Servantem, & tacitam secreta in sede latentem Tyndarida aspicio; dant clara incendia lucem Erranti; passim{que} oculos per cuncta ferenti: Illa sibi infestos eversa ob Pergama Teu∣cros, Et pena Danaum, & deserti Conjugis iras Permetuens, Trojae & patris communis Erynnis Abdiderat sete, at{que} aris invisa sedebat
Exarsere ignes animo; subit ira, caden∣tem Ulcisci patriam, & sceleratas sumere poenas. In Vesta's Temple Helen I perceiv'd, By fear of Death almost of Life bereav'd: The dismal flames 'midst the thick shades of Night Gave to my wandring eyes sufficient light: She who the Trojans had so dearly cost For whom their Empire, Goods, and Lives were lost, Justly expected that such injur'd Foes Would with their Swords stamp on her breast their Woes; Fearing no less with guilty blood t, asswage Her injur'd Husband and the Grecian rage. Expecting thus till wrathful Greece or Troy Should the dire cause of both their ills destroy. There th' Altars did a hiding-place afford, Ther whom men hated, and the Gods ab∣horr'd.
Mean while as this famous Grecian Beauty which first fired the Trojan's hearts and then their houses, though seized on by so much fear, yet escaped the mischief she so dreaded, seeing her self after the sack of the great and state∣ly Ilium, kindlier entertained than ever, in the arms of her Husband Menelaus, and after her loose abandoning her self to the embraces of Paris, more honour∣ed than before by the Grecian Princes; so Vannoza saw all this uproar termina∣ted in a gracious reception from her hus∣band, who was over-joyed at his fortu∣nate escape from the destructive hand of thieves, who (as he thought) had fixed the Ladder there to scale the Walls of his House and rob him of his Goods: Thus after a furious storm and tempest, there remains no tokens of the terrour but a little foam which the billows have driven upon the shoars; and a little rain and dirt upon the ground, after the noise of thunder and tempestuous whirl∣winds: O God where is the verity of thy declaration of happiness unto the good, and evil to the wicked?
How long, how long, Lord just and true Shall the curst troops of evil doers Boldly their wickedness pursue, Fearless of eathly or heavenly powers? Shall they for ever with impunity Thy Servants wrong, and the dread power defie? But stay my Soul, the way is slippery, thy feet may well slide and deceive thee, where thy wings intended to bear thee aloft: Do not molest thy self to see The wicked in prosperitie; With envy don't thy self oppress, To see them thrive in wickedness, Like flourishing and verdant grass Whose beauty suddenly does pass, Or flowers which ravish the eye But soon are withered and dry. Stay but a while, thou shalt behold The wicked gone like tales long told; And all their glories no more seen Nor heard then if they'd never been. What astonishing amazment seized on Vannoza, who seeing her self lifted from
the depth of despair, to the highest top of happiness, could not choose but su∣spect its reality, and as a bad conscience is never in security, she feared that she was brought to be sacrificed, as those of old with Musick and Garlands; But by little and little she reassumed her courage, understanding by the recital of the ad∣venture (which every one reported ac∣cording to his fancy) that Alcimus had escaped unknown, and past amongst that uproar for one that intended to rob Capoleon of his Riches rather than his Honour, nay rather for a troop of Rob∣bers, for the wounded servant, and those that fled, deceived by the darkness of the night and their own fear (which hath the property to make that appear which is not, and to multiply to an in∣finity that which hath any thing of rea∣lity) made this deceit pass for a verity, none being able to contradict it: Capole∣on searched all parts of the house, but found nothing of what he sought for, but found his traces and footings in the Garret, and thence passing to the Her∣mitage of this holy Female, he told her it was no wonder that he had heard a noise there before, and that there were
other Apparitions than those of Spirits and Fantomes, for these had both Flesh and Bones; the Window where the Lad∣der was found fastned was condemned as culpable, the Garret on all parts bar∣ricadoed up as criminal, the passage over the Gallery stopped up, and all the Ave∣nues made inaccessible; But it was im∣possible these Serpents to vomit out their poison which was so deeply fixed in their Breasts; it was therefore time for Justice to give fire to her train, one spark being enough to blow up all, and the finding but one end of the thread sufficient to unravel the intangled Clew: One of Al∣cimus his servants having been taken and bound by the Sergeants, was by them carryed to Prison, where before the Judge that took his examination, he confessed but too much, manifesting his own in∣nocence, by the discovery of his Masters guilt: Magistrates who are living Laws themselves, and interpreters onely of the dead or written ones, are most common∣ly like the Spiders, which seize on small Flies, but let the great Wasps and Bees alone in quietness; so that of the Poet may well be applied to them:
Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura co∣lumbas. To ravening Crows they gentle prove, But vex and plague the harmless Dove. His design was to impose silence on this innocent prisoner, and thereby to purchase the title of prudent, rather than that of just; and it being in his power by the means of many other witnesses which he named to him, to prove his Adultery, and punish it according to Law, he was afraid to make too much noise about it, least (like a Dog that barks too much) he should be beaten for his fidelity; He knew the Grandeur and Puissance of Alcimus his Family, and further, that if the secret should once come to Capoleon's knowledge, he would seek Heaven and Earth for vengeance, and never stop at Blood or Murther. It is not, certainly without reason, that the wisest of men hath said, That a man of little courage ought not to undertake the Of∣fice of a Magistrate, least fearing the face of the Puissant, or the Power of the Mighty, he cause a scandal, or act an injustice by his timiditie.
The Judge for fear of raising himself enemies amongst those where both the offenders and the injur'd were equally his friends, privately advised Alcimus, that it was best to withdraw his man from Prison, through the golden gate, and lock up his lips with a key of the same Mettal, least the springing of that Mine should blow him up into destru∣ction. This young Cavalier, unexpe∣rienced in worldly affairs, slighted this advice, and thinking himself clearly and secretly escaped from the ship-wrack, was not contented wholly to deny all that had been confessed, but threatned his Servant with the highest Menaces, to make him be punisht as a calumniatour, and lastly, make him die by the hands of Justice, which made him stronglier persist in his depositions, and all his com∣panions for witnesses, knowing no other way to save his life and regain his liber∣ty: The Judge being no less friend un∣to the Family than to the person of Alcimus, advertised his Parents of it, who were already told by their own Spy of all their Proceedings, which was the cause that to avoid scandal, and least that which was yet secret should become
publick, they took him aside, and after many grave Remonstrances and serious Admonitions (notwithstanding his posi∣tive denyal and horrible protestations, as if Sacriledge and Adultery could be that way purged) they gave him to un∣derstand how they had light on the Clew that led them in the pursuit of him through all his crooked Maeanders of wickedness: But this instead of amend∣ing him made him worse, by adding the fire of Anger to that of Lust, so that his choler choaking his reason, put him in a fury against his servants, their honest care and fidelity appearing to him not onely a base disobedience and disloyalty, but an unpardonable injury: so true it is, that as the good change all to good, and make profit of their losses, the wicked turn that which is good into evil, taking services for affronts, and the amity one strives to shew them for a passion rather importunate and trouble∣some than worthy an acknowledgment; so that instead of applying soft Oyls and Lenitives to this Sore, to abate the In∣flammation, he rather strove to heighten it to a Gangrene, by threatning nothing else but revenge against his Servants, by
discarding, blows or something worse, so far did his fury transport him against those whose onely Crime was too much fidelity: And to arrive to the top of his folly, he resolved instead of getting liberty for the Prisoner, to become a party against him, and procure his death from the hands of Justice, by Artifices as full of sublety as impiety, thinking to bury his fault in the grave of this in∣nocent: Thus David strove by the sin of Murther to make himself more free and secret in the Commission of that of Adultery. The End of the Third Book.
ALCIMUS AND VANNOZA. LIB. IV. SEE here Alcimus arrived at the very Crisis of his wick∣edness; And see how far more easie it is to corrupt Judges on the side of Cle∣mency, than on that of Rigour; since as the Lawyers say, That the soveraign se∣verity
of the Law is a supream injury; like those Remedies of Steel and Fire, which Chirurgions use, to dismember and stop the Gangrenes of their Patients; Remedies more painful than the Diseases which they cure. If Alcimus had pru∣dently designed to free the Prisoner, and to smother his depositions, to avoid the stirring up a dung-hill which would fill the City with noisome and pestilential vapours, and by silence to save the lives and salve the honours of the principal offenders, there is no question but the Judge had closed with the design; for as Eleazar attacqued Antiochus his Ele∣phant in the flank, the most tender and onely penetrable part of this vast body, so Officers of Justice are sooner van∣quish'd by pity than by any other means, compassion being a charm whose sweet∣ness abates and betrayes the most hardy courages, but to commit an injustice at∣tended with cruelty is the part of a De∣vil rather than a man. This was the cause that Alcimus, what artifices soever he used, whether by intreaty, promises, or threats, to arrive unto the top of his pernicious design, was totally frustrated and deceived, and driven upon the same
rock on which he would have split his inculpable servant. Being in this like the Ape, which hopping up the boughs of a Tree, the higher he climbs, the more he discovers his shame; or like the Pea∣cock, who the higher and more proudly he erects his plumes, the more does he discover the parts he should strive to hide. There is no stronger accusation than excuses too far stretch't, and too violently urged, as none are less believed than those who think by Oaths and Blasphemies to strengthen their affirma∣tions. Judges alone cannot order the Pro∣cess, having to that end their Clerks, Proctors, Advocates and Registers; and the parties themselves, who like Birds discover themselves by their notes: But what was worst of all, Capoleon prose∣cuting for Justice against him whom he thought one of the Thieves that had at∣tempted to rob him, by too sollicitously searching what he ought not, found what he would not, nor ever thought of; like an ignorant Glass-maker, who intending to blow a Glass, makes a Bot∣tle, or a more useless and ill-shap'd Ves∣sel: Good Heaven! how was he sur∣prized
at the prisoner's depositions! a Maid gathering flowers in a Garden or Meadow for a Poesie or a Garland, and suddainly seeing an ugly Serpent leap from under them, is not in a stranger disturbance than was Capoleon at this amazing news, which (as it often hap∣pens) was as near the truth as it was far from appearance: But as age had indued him with prudence, he, like a true Ita∣lian smother'd his resentments, making a shew to the reporter, as if it were as far from his belief, as it was from truth or likelihood; But imagine in the mean time what an assault this was to his jea∣lous spirit: But according to the Custom of the Nobility, who despise the ordina∣ry proceeding of Justice, which they will render to themselves by furious reven∣ges; Capoleon being hereupon resolved, though quick enough both of sight and hearing, seemed to be both deaf and blind, nay more than that, insensible of this affront, giving out, That he would not engage his Honour upon the deposition of a Villain, who strove to save himself by accu∣sing his Master; and who like one that is a drowning, catched indifferently at all he saw, or what ever he thought might be instrumen∣tal to his safety.
On the other side, Alcimus, as if he had sworn his own ruine (it being no won∣der that he who is once blinded stumbles at all that lyes in his way, and proceeds from bad to worse) after having outra∣ged, beaten, and abused his Servants, turned them all out of doors; they be∣ing called for Witnesses by the prisoner, their despight for this injury made them easily consent to tell the whole truth against their Master, which appearing by the conformity of their depositions, the prisoner was enlarged, and cleared of the attempt of robbing Capoleon's house; and as in War there are no Soul∣diers kindlier received, than those whose bad pay or worse usage forces them to change parties, their anger or apprehen∣sion of being taken and punish'd as Tray∣tors, making them doubly bold and de∣sperate; so Capoleon, ingenious in search∣ing into the original of his Evils, by fair words, and ample promises, drew from these shamefully injur'd Servants, a per∣fect declaration of all the most subtle and secret of Alcimus his Contrivances. Thus was Alcimus the Artisan of his own mis∣fortune, and the ruiner of his own pro∣jects, which he manifested by the same
industries by which he thought to con∣ceal them, like the Hare, which declares the nearness of her end by her often dou∣bling. But Capoleon now by many circum∣stances, assured of that which he before did but conjecture, no longer questioned the loss of his Honour, and the disloyalty of his Wife, but studied how to repair it by a memorable Vengeance, which should serve for an example to all poste∣rity. To this end, making no shew of being offended, and at the same time seeming less jealous than ever of Vanno∣za, and letting the Judge know (who he knew would soon advertise Alcimus) that he did not in the least suspect his Wifes Integrity, believing his own experience sooner than the depositions of a Rogue; nor would he ever believe that so noble and brave a person as Alcimus should en∣terprize so unworthy an action as the robbing of his house, or attempting the Chastity of his Wife, he by this means confirmed Vannoza against all fear of pu∣nishment, who gave an exact accompt of all these passages to Alcimus, who on his part did the like to her of all he knew, lest she should let her self be betray'd to
a confession by furious threats or deceit∣ful promises, mingled with the false Ca∣resses of Capoleon, so that strengthening one another in their mischievous acti∣ons, they imagined that they had walked in Clouds hitherto, and feared not but to find means to do so for the future. Ca∣poleon thus Cajoling his Wife as treache∣rously, as she Caressed him deceitfully, do by their reciprocal dissimulation illu∣strate the truth of the Wise Man's saying, My Son, those who flatter thee, are they that do intend to betray thee. Fraud is an im∣poisoned potion, which first begets a Vertigo, and then a mortal Lethargick slumber, which securely luls us into de∣struction. Capoleon all this while was pitching his snares to entrap the prey, which should make an ample satisfaction to his vengeance. He sets more Spyes on work than Argus had Eyes: he gives his Wife more liberty than ever, imitating the Gaoler, who in the morning puts those Prisoners into a pleasant Garden by his Prison, who at night must upon a Scaffold serve for a Tragique spectacle; or the Butchers, who gently stroak and claw those Beasts which they are about to
knock down and kill: Thus a dead still∣ness precedes an Earthquake; but while our unskilful Mariners thought the storm was blown over their heads, the clouds were thickening for a Tempest which they were shortly to hear singing through their Ears, which were now shut against whatsoever seemed to obstruct their new designs. The difficulty of the action did the more inflame Alcimus his Passion, who now became the more amorous of Vannoza, the harder it was to enjoy her: The commerce with bad Women having this Similitude with Mount Aetna, whose flames grow fiercer by the Rain which extinguisheth others, and Scorpion-like, they can shoot that sting which nothing can cure but a Medicine extracted from their own bodies. But if this fire be so imperious in the green Tree, what is it in the dry? I mean in the feeble spirit of Vannoza, whose flames raged so much the fiercer, by how much she had the less strength to resist them. These workers of iniquity begun again to weave a Net for their own destruction, for which they found no thread fitter than their old one of Father Simplicius; for Vannoza (having no other door of liberty
open but that of the Church, never stirring out but under the pretext of Devotion, whereby she found means to signifie her mind to her Gallant by those pretended∣ly holy characters) went presently after this unhappy uproar to this good Father, to discover to him the imaginary attempt of the Robbers, in the fashion which she judged most proper to give a colour to her justification. This well-meaning Religious Father, who had taken the common report for truth, (a report as favourable to Alcimus as he could desire for the covering of his Theft, which was of far greater concernment than what had been imagined) was much surprized when he heard from the mouth of Van∣noza, That he who fixed this ladder did it with a design to attack the impregna∣ble Fort of her Chastity, and that the Robber was no other than Alcimus ac∣companied by his Servants, one of which being taken, had discovered all the de∣sign unto the Court of Justice, and whose depositions had been confirmed by the testimony of his Companions; and with∣al, renewing her Plaints against this Gen∣tleman, as one whose often repulses had rendred desperate, and who by that
means was come to this extremity, which was an injury for which no earth∣ly punishment was great enough; adding, That for all this, God had been so merci∣ful unto him, that Capoleon's Heart was not thereby fill'd with any suspition or rage, and that notwithstanding his for∣mer Jealousies, which time and her Pious Endeavours had now well near effaced, he was now more inclined to hold the Servants Accusation for false, than to imagine that the Master could admit of so base and unworthy a design. Simplicius knew not what to answer hereunto, onely, That her suspitions might be true, but yet that it was possible for them to be false, since Fear has the property to make us easily believe ill of those we mistrust; as love makes us ever think well of those we affect: but yet it was necessary to be well informed before we condemn, for fear of passing a rash Judgment. Promising her withal to use his utmost endeavour to free her from this trouble, and the op∣pression of her frantick pursuer; and so comforting her the best he could, he dis∣mist her with a blessing. Alcimus betaking himself to the same
Asylu, came to excuse himself to this good Father, and to make protestations of his Innocence, taking the common Report for his Vindication; alledging, That the voice of the People and of ma∣ny waters, was that of God: and withal inveighing against the treachery of his Servants, who to bring one of their Comrades out of Prison, had conspired against his Honour, to save themselves under the shelter of his authority. Simplicius replyed, That he had really been of this perswasion, and that he had an∣swered the same to the continual suspitions and ordinary Complaints of Vannoza, who daily buzzed in his ears her suspitions of these passages for realities. Alcimus, who desired nothing more than a Personal Conference with this Lady, protested to him, That in his presence he could bring her to confess that her opinion was as false as the contrary was true; being now perfectly cured of the impressions that her Beauty had struck into his Soul. By this means they were so subtilly wicked as to discover their Minds be∣fore this good Father, but in a Language
which he understood not; these being of those deceitful lips which the Psal∣mist speaks of, that spoke with a heart and a heart. And thus by the charitable in∣terposition of this Pious Man, whose zeal they abused with as much Impiety as Impudence, they both by word and wri∣ting renewed their former intercourses, and what was more horribly wicked, in those holy places, adding to the rest the abuse of those Sacraments, which if rightly used are the seal of Salvation, but by that means the instruments of insup∣portable damnation, from that Eternal God, to whom not only the Intelligences which rule the World do bow, but even the Infernal Powers tremble. O extre∣mity of hard-heartedness, and more than Diabolical iniquity! Capoleon, who had always his Sentinels set, watching the deportments of his immodest Wife, and the means to draw her into the snares he had pitched, was advertised of all these proceedings, and being informed that she was often in Confessions with Sim∣plicius, where Alcimus still came as to Confession, and where they had long discourses together; this Man whose Jealousie was even encreased to a frenzy,
meditating nothing else but vengeance, took it for granted that this Father was an accomplice of his Wife's wickedness, his spirit being now open to the most horrible and worst impressions. His suspitions redoubled by the Visits which Simplicius made to his Penitent in his house, to alleviate the afflictious of spi∣rit which seemingly tormented her, even to despair, caused as well by Alcimus his deportments, as by the jealousies of her suspitious Husband; all which were but so many inventions to cloak her sublime subtlety. These well-meaning Visits of Simplicius in Capoleon's house were not without some short remonstrances to the Old man; not lightly to believe the ru∣mours of the Town, the reports of Lac∣queys and such loose kind of people, whose only design was to advance them∣selves by flattery, at the expence of an∣other's reputation, and to work their own credit by the defamation of the most virtuous persons. This added strength to his Jealousie, and suspition of Simplicius, whom he hereby concluded to be one of the parties, and thereby wor∣thy to be included in their punishment. And thus by a mis-intelligence of what
was spoken in sincerity, this poor inno∣cent Monk was mark'd out for destructi∣on amongst the rest. My haste to finish the recital of so ma∣ny horrible iniquities, will make me slip more slightly over many of the malici∣ous industries which Satan suggested to these his devoted servants, to plunge them first into their filthy pleasures, and lastly into Eternal destruction. The Poets amongst their many fabu∣lous inventions, metamorphose not their gods into so many shapes, as Alcimus took to encounter his Vannoza; for as if he had absolutely took upon him the profession of a Comedian, there was no sort of habit which he made not use of to see or speak to her, who had wholly trans∣formed him from what he was before; which was the more easie for him to ac∣complish, since Capoleon had now laid the reins on their necks, whom he saw run∣ing headlong to a Precipice. She went and came whither she pleased, and that without the company of her Mother, and Alcimus daily saw her under pretexts and different shapes; In Monasteries and Churches in a Religious habit; Other∣whiles in Churches he convers'd with
her in the habit of a veiled Woman; If she walk in Gardens, he becomes Gardi∣ner; sometimes accosting her as a Beg∣gar; sometimes as an Artisan, a seller of Wares, a Waiting-Woman, a Kins∣woman, and divers other ways, his face being still disguised and suited to his se∣veral habits; by which means he decei∣ved Vannoza's followers, who were so many Guards and Spies upon her actions, to make report unto her Husband of all her passages, turns and conferences: I will a little expatiate upon one of his re∣fined subtleties, whereby the sharpness of his invention seemed to triumph over that of Vannoza. Walking one day to a neighbouring Church, accompanied one∣ly by one of her Maids, she was (seem∣ingly) accidentally almost covered over with dirty Water which was cast out of a Window, which defiled all her clothes in a shameful manner, and suddainly a Woman, whom she knew not, appeared at the Door to excuse the mis-hap, seem∣ing to be inexpressibly sorry, and offer∣ing her her House, her Chamber, and the choice of all her Clothes to make her re∣paration for this heedless injury: These Excuses for an Affront seemingly unpre∣meditated,
appeased Vannoza's anger, and the present necessity of avoiding the dis∣grace and laughter of the people, con∣strained her to enter into this offer'd Lodging; where she was no sooner ad∣mitted, but sending home her Maid for other Clothes, she being left alone, Alci∣mus presently appeared, and let her know, That it was he who had invented this Device, which he termed a Gallantry, (unhappy that he was, thus to glory in his Crime, and rejoyce in his Confusion) to enjoy her with the greater freedom. See the deep subtlety that's here exprest, And by this one act judge of all the rest. If formerly the excellency of a Painter appeared, in a line direct, streight, slen∣der, and almost imperceptible; Judge whether by this unthought of Artifice, Alcimus did not manifest himself a good proficient in the School of Vannoza's subtlety. But finally, as if they had been weary of living longer amidst these con∣straints, they consulted how to set them∣selves at large in the fields of wickedness, by the assistance of trusty persons: To which end Vannoza thought it most ma∣terial
to endeavour to make her Sentinels and Gaolers instrumental to her design, so that finally after many Artifices and Caresses, having dazzled the eyes of two of her attendants, with a Metal almost as sparkling as the Sun that makes it, and by the rayes of a Thousand promi∣ses, he exacted from them the vows of a faithless fidelity, bound with such so∣lemn Oaths, that their horrour presaged their breach and nullity; and conse∣quently she declared to them her passion for Alcimus, her secret intelligences, and the desire she had to possess him, and be possessed by him, with a greater freedom: Capoleon who before had these Maids his stipendaries, had by one of them the door opened, which gave him a view of all these dark proceedings. It is hard to judge whether it be more proper to call this servant Treacherous or Faithful; for if she was perfidious to her disloyal Mi∣stress, she was faithful to her Master, who had paid and appointed her to watch his honour: To speak more properly, let us term her a female, and cast upon her Sex the fault of incapacity of guarding a Secret, rather than to accuse her of trea∣chery, since (as is to be supposed) making
a profession of honesty, besides incon∣stancy, she further imitated the Sea, which will not harbour a dead Carcass or Carrion, (unless kept down by a Weight) but vomiteth it out upon her Shoars; A Secret in Woman being like new Wine, which purgeth its self, and works out at the mouth of the Vessel. And indeed what reason had she to keep faith with her, who had broken hers to her Husband? It is the Receiver that makes the Thief; and if there were not these Mediators, there would be fewer Adulteries. This Servant in accusing the Treason of her Mistriss, must necessa∣rily discover that of her Companion; and the cautelous Capoleon having dou∣bled her Salary, and made further promi∣ses of Golden Mountains, when he had surprized the Delinquents, and accom∣plish'd his design, he was thereby hourly advertised of all the Words and Inter∣courses of our two Lovers: and Capoleon had so wholly won this Servant to his party, (whom we shall call Adriana) that like a Coy-Duck she served him to draw the rest into the Net; so that by her Ma∣ster's order, cutting both ways, she ac∣commodated her self to all the designs of
her Mistress, holding in seemingly with her and her Lover, but really with Capo∣leon, she on all hands reaped a Golden Harvest: The other, (whom we will call Lisarda) whether it were that she naturally abhorr'd such double dealing, or whether she feared that her report (as seemingly it would) should be the occa∣sion of blood and mischief; or were it that she took compassion of her Mistress, having a horrour of deceiving her who had so freely imparted a Secret to her, which imported no less than her life; or were it (which is most likely) that the strongest Adamant attracted this Iron, and that the double recompences of Al∣cimus and Vannoza joyned to the gale of promises which filled the Sail of her de∣sires, out-weighed the sparing Salaries of this penurious Old Man; Which so∣ever of all these was the Motive, she wholly quitted Capoleon's Party for the other of her Mistresses, and firmly em∣barqued her self amongst all her Enter∣prizes: But yet she acting with more fear and mistrust of Capoleon than her Compassion did, she saw (not without Envy, the ordinary disease of feeble spi∣rits) her self less intrusted and imploved
than Adriana was, who behaved and sui∣ted her self with greater boldness and complaisance to all the impudent designs of her infamous Mistress. Under the guidance of these two Stars, nothing seemed impossible, nay nothing difficult to these two criminal Lovers, who raising Trophies to their Conquests, seemed to lead Capoleon's Honour in triumph; and thought themselves so far raised above fear, as Thunder and Tem∣pests should for the future be below their fact: But as Holophernes dulled with the vapours of the Wine, and Sisera with the Milk which they had plentifully sucked in, were unsuspectedly transmit∣ted from the Brother to the Sister, from sleep to death, by Judith and Jael, so our impenitent Offenders securely sleeping amidst the stupefactions of their sins, did insensibly draw on their punishment by those means which they thought most conducing to a pleasant and delicious life: They now proceeded with impu∣nity, and seemed now to glory in their crime, and colour their unlawful passion with some image of reason. Capoleon advertised by Adriana of all their wickedness and mockeries, kept his
patience, that like Vulcan he might take them at his ease, and have his turn to laugh at their Tragical success: Imagine but what flegme the enraged Capoleon must have to qualifie so much choler, and how dexterously he retired to make a greater leap, and deferr'd his vengeance to execute it the more severely; all the Letters which passed through Adriana's hands were communicated to him, by which he understood all the motions of this unhappy Cabal: Oft-times over∣come with rage and fury, he was on the point of breaking out into a bloody exe∣cution; but whether he thought the fruit not yet ripe enough, whether he were not sufficiently assured of his men who were to assist him in the action; whether God (the hour of Chastisement of these execrable offenders being not yet come) withheld the arm of this Execu∣tioner of his Justice, by moderating the Motions of his heart to attend the re∣pentance of the Criminals: or whether, after the Mode of that Nation, he staid for an opportunity to envelope in one common ruine all those whom he thought Accomplices in this fact: How∣ever it were, he was restrained by some
secret cause; till one day (the measure of the sins of these Sacrilegious Adulte∣rers being now arrived to the height) after having provided himself of all things necessary, both of Men and Arms, he pretended to take a Journey about an Important Affair which he had at a Town three days Journey from home. Now consider by what follows, whether it were not high time for Capoleon to come to a conclusion, seeing the extream mad∣ness, and last point of Villany to which these two Criminals were now arrived; for as it is common with Adulterers, and especially those who have Sacriledge an∣nexed, to draw on Homicides in the train of their other vices, Alcimus and Vanno∣za earnest of an unconstrained recipro∣cal enjoyment, were come to a resolu∣tion of ridding themselves of the Old Man, either by Sword to Poison, to plain their way to a future Marriage. This Journey was laid hold on by Vannoza, as a sit occasion to perpetrate the Murther by Bravo's (so they call the Italian Assas∣sins) in some Wood or narrow passage, under colour of Robbery. This Coun∣sel broached first by Vannoza, was readi∣ly embraced by her Adonis, who for
Money failed not of Men who under∣took to execute this Bloody Enterprize: Vannoza had divers times attempted the courage of her Maid, to slip some poyson into Capoleon's Meat or Wine, but Lisarda loth to envelope her self in so desperate a design; Adriana however more seem∣ingly compliant, presently gave her Ma∣ster warning to avoid this intended mis∣chief. But now this Assassinate being pro∣jected, broke off the other more dange∣rous design of poysoning, but (as if se∣crecy were incompatible to that Sex) Vannoza reveal'd it to Adriana, praising it for an Heroick Action, and singing Songs of Triumph before the Victory. Capoleon making preparation for his pretended Journey, Adriana amazedly came running to disswade him from it, revealing the Conspiracy that was made against him; to whom the crafty Old Man to dissipate her Fears, answered her, That he would countermine them, and by taking the takers, marr all their Plots: En∣couraging her to be faithful to him; and so thanking her for her advice, he dismist her. He had already caused all the Keys of
his house to be counterfeited, to enter at what times he pleased, to take the Cri∣minals in the act: Whereupon he set forwards in good equipage, and well at∣tended, having under-hand given order that all his Wifes actions should be dili∣gently watched, leaving one in trust to learn of Adriana the news of her deport∣ments: He had so long given Vannoza her swing, that he now seemed to be no longer jealous. His Journey was so well coloured, that there was no subject left to suspect it; He was followed three or four miles by a Servant of Alcimus, to see what way he took: At the place where he Dined he remained until night, and returned to the Town very late; where being retired to a private house, he heard from Adriana that his back was hardly turned when Alcimus came to supply his place in the habit of a Jeweller. The Night was in the middle of its course, and darkness more then Cimme∣rian had over-spread the surface of the Earth, and the sweetness of rest and hea∣viness of sleep had rendred the Condition of most in the City little different in ap∣pearance from that of the dead; when Capoleon, whose many designs and
thoughts had bereaved him of repose, covered with a Coat of Male, and Head∣piece, and armed with Pistols, Poniards and Sword, accompanied by six men, some of them  Servants, and others Bravo's, compleatly armed, and resolved to execute Capoleon's vengeance, with so much the more boldness, by how much it seemed more just and reasonable, and therefore they less subject to the fear of scandal or of punishment, came to the house with the false Keys we lately men∣tioned, arriving without noise to Van∣noza's Bed-Chamber, who had admitted Alcimus into her Husband's Bed, where they lay soundly sleeping in the close em∣braces of one another. The door being bolted on the in side, he knocked at it like a Master, and as one resolved to en∣ter by fair means or foul, and that spee∣dily, being then unable to suppress the movements of his Passion, to counter∣feit his voice, or moderate his Anger. What case Vannoza was in when thus suddainly awaked, I leave it to the Rea∣der to imagine, hearing the eager and angry sound of her Husband's voice, who thus surprized her betwixt the Arms of a man, who together with her had not
only robb'd him of his Honour, but con∣spired against his life: A thousand ter∣rours seiz'd her in a moment; the fears of death, and danger of Hell environed her, so that it bereaved her of all usage of Reason or discourse; as those whom a Wolfe had got the first sight of: The two Maids which slept in the Wardrobe being awaked with the noise, Lisarda was almost dead with fear; but that of Adriana was only counterfeit, because she kept intelligence with that party; though the thoughts of the succeeding Execu∣tion could not but make her tremble: She rose, and softly ask'd her Mistress What she did intend to do? Who being with fear almost as much stupified as she that was turned into a Pillar of Salt for looking back upon her flaming City, an∣swered her not a word. What say'st thou Alcimus in this pressing necessity, or to whom wilt thou betake thy self? O how true is the Saying of an Ancient Roman Historian! That when the hand of Destiny layes hold on a man's Collar, he be∣comes even stupified, his Senses taken from him, and as if he were fetter'd with invi∣sible Chains; he has neither Courage to at∣tacque his Enemy, nor to defend himself, nor
feet to flye. At least ye defiled Souls, since you are deprived of all hope of escaping a Temporal death, think of preserving your selves from an Eternal one. Now think of your Salvation at this point of extremity, this precious moment; manage with a hearty desire and unfeigned repen∣tance your reconciliation with the Father of Mercies, who hath promised graciously to receive sinners at what hour soever they heartily repent: But O Lord! how just art thou! and how much equity accompanies thy Judgments. And how true is that saying of one of thy Saints, That it is reasonable he should forget himself in dying, who living never had any remembrance of thee. During this mute consultation, and fix'd resolution, they beat still more rudely at the Door, calling, swearing, cursing and threatning to break it down; which so daunted the spirit of Vannoza, ever till then so sharp and subtile, that seeing her self discover'd and betray'd, and without other hope of safety than what she could gather from the deepest desperation, knowing the impossibility of her Husband's pardoning this out∣rage, she took the first counsel that her
despair suggested, and which was infu∣sed into her Soul by the Evil spirit, who like a Crow croaking after carrion, wat∣ched for nothing but his prey; for see∣ing Adriana going to open the Door, she leap'd out of the Bed, and opening a Window which look'd into the Garden, she cast her self violently down, where lighting upon a graven Effigies of stone, she broke her Skull in divers pieces, and her Brains were scattered all about; her Body almost battered to pieces, made passages enough for her adulterous, sacri∣legious and desperate Soul to go to the place design'd for it; but where, I am too charitable to speak my thoughts. Alcimus having entred the house in the habit of a Jeweller, had neither Sword nor Stick to defend himself; all that he could do, seeing the door a opening, was to leap out of his Bed and exchange it for a Closet, where he entred, and shut the Door after him; he opened the Window to save himself that way, by another leap like that of Vannoza, and to precipitate himself into death by running from it: But this proved no door of safety to him, it being treillissed with Barrs of Iron; for his defence he found nothing but
Looking-Glasses Powders, Perfumes, and such like toys which Vannoza had used either to augment her Beauty, or repair its defaults; these had been the sparks that had help'd to raise such a flame in this young man's Soul; but now those Odours only could serve to help to Em∣balm his Body: For notwithstanding all the resistance he could make, Capoleon and his followers soon entred into the Chamber, and seeing Vannoza dispatch∣ed by her Fall, and knowing from Adria∣na that Alcimus was shut into the Cabi∣net, the door was quickly forced open, and the young Cavalier being only in his shirt, soon found himself pierced in di∣vers places of his Body, and constrain'd to yield unto the mercy of his Enemy; who, like the cruel Tiberius, would not speed him too suddainly, least he should thereby deprive himself of the pleasure of Revenge, and therefore would stretch his Torments by the prolongation of his Life; He dragg'd him into the Chamber, and threw him on the Bed, which he so lately had unhappily polluted, to use him as they do those Robbers, whom they execute upon the place where they acted
their Villanies: Fear so seized on Adria∣na that she run to hide herself, though she had no cause to fear for that for which she expected a Reward: Lisarda cried out Murther, despairing of her Life, but was laid hold on all undrest by Capoleon, who sacrific'd her to his fury before Alcimus his face, charging her with as many stabs as injurious words, letting out her Soul and Blood together upon the spot: Alcimus then might see before his eyes the cruelties and tor∣ments they prepared for him to suffer, the report of which strikes a trembling and horrour into me, like one who looks on affrightful wounds. Capoleon to com∣pleat his revenge, he sent a Messenger speedily to the Monastery where Simpli∣cius resided, to beseech him to come to his Wife, who was upon the point of death by a Catarre, but desired to con∣fess her self to him before she expired: This good Father arose with all imagina∣ble speed, pressed forwards by a Holy Charity, which causes a slighting and neglect of rest to run to the succour of Souls and service of our Neighbour, principally in such urgent occasions of
suddain death, where the least delay is inexcusable: He took to accompany him the first Brother of the Covent that he met, and so run with all the haste ima∣ginable to a mischief unjustly prepared for his Innocency: He was no sooner entred the Chamber where Capoleon was tormenting Alcimus, but this enraged old Man leaping on him like a Fury, went to stab his Dagger into his breast, but Nature foreing him to lift up his Arm, he thereby saved his heart, took the Stab there, which was followed by another in his shoulder: finally, he was going to follow those with as many as should be more than enough to let out his harmless Soul, if his barbarity had not withheld his Arm, to bathe himself in the pleasure of his sufferings, as he had done in those of the wretched Alci∣mus, who lying stretch't upon the Bed, endured far worse Convulsions than a Woman in her Travel. The other Re∣ligious Brother who accompanied him, was detained below by the other blood-hounds, who abused him with blows and injuries, which I dare not, nay cannot report, no more than those which were vomited by Capoleon against Simplicius;
Traytor, Sacrilegious, Execrable, worthy of thousands of flames, were the flowers of his Rhetorick; as for the other vil∣lanous and filthy words, I have no design here to register them. There needs a more Eloquent Orator, than I to express the astonishment of good Simplicius, who coming to assist this Penitent in a holy death, found himself betray'd to an undeserved one. He was then hardly thoroughly awaked, and was of a firm opinion that he was still sound asleep, and all that he saw and felt pass'd but for a dream; but at last his Wounds so brought him to himself, that he was too sure that he was fully awa∣ked. Alcimus heavily lifting up his eye∣lids, all drench't and bathed in tears and blood, and seeing this new dreadful spe∣ctacle, and hearing a broken and lan∣guishing voice, Alas (said he with a mournful tone) my Father, to what abyss of mischiefs have my inquities plunged you. And turning his face towards Capoleon, Signeur (pursued he) 'tis onely against me you ought to turn the point of your weapons, and not upon this Innocent; it is I only that am culpable, and of whom alone you should take just vengeance, which can never be so
cruel as my wickedness deserves; but im∣brew not your hands in the blood of the just, which God will be sure to require at your hands, and exact from you a rigorous ac∣compt of. It is I alone have sinned, and deceived and abus'd him; and if you please to give me but one moments audience, I will tell you in short the truth of the whole pro∣ceeding; I am going to dye, and neither ex∣pect or desire pardon from God, if I lye or use any disguisement of the truth. Then taking Capoleon's silence for consent, he laid open, as well as his throbs and pangs would suffer him, that which we have recounted of Vannoza's Artifices and his own, to defile the bed and betray the honour of Capoleon: adding thereunto many other particularities, (most of which we have already recited) but with what brevity he could, his condition not admitting of a long discourse. He made this publick and solemn Con∣fession with so much repentance and contrition, that his heart seemed to cleave asunder with sighs, which broke out as fast as the blood gushed from his mouth, and his eyes boyling over with tears as fast as the blood bubbled from his gastly Wounds: How many pardons did he beg
of God, and of Capoleon, detesting his faults, and abhorring his iniquities. O how many Lives could he have desired, that he might expiate his crimes by as many deaths! animating Capoleon to take all the revenges of him he could desire, by the longest and most exquisite tor∣ments he could invent: He absolutely cleared Simplicius of the Crime, and made his Innocence unquestionably apparent; which made Capoleon see the injustice of his Cruelty to him; who thereupon or∣dered his Wounds to be bound up, and in the next place sent to know certainly the condition of his Wife; which vex'd him to the Soul when he was assured that her death had mock'd his Cruelty, and robb'd him of a more severe revenge. Before Simplicius was retired from this Bloody Spectacle, Alcimus making the strongest of his weak efforts, rouled him∣self upon the ground, and so prostrate begged of Capoleon, who held his Swords point bent against his Throat, To have pity of his Soul, though not of his Body, and to content himself with his Temporal death, and not stretch his hatred to Eternity, but to permit him to receive Absolution from Sim∣plicius his hands: Which the Cruel Capo∣leon
would have denyed him, (so far did his rage transport him) had not the in∣jured Simplicius prevented him, by step∣ing to him, and in this last extremity ma∣king him give the best testimony he could of his Contrition; and thereupon giving him his lost Viaticum. The words which Alcimus spake to him, seeing him depart, and leave him as a prey to his inhumane Enemy, were sufficient to breed Pity in the insensible Rocks, or in the Waves themselves, which all hold inexorable; but this bloody Ty∣ger growing still more furious at this Mournful Musick, consulted with his Affistants which environed him, in what manner they should torment him, to make his death more sensibly painful; He commanded a fire to be lighted, to burn him by degrees, and laying him in the heat of the flames, had not the pa∣rience to let the Element (though mer∣ciless enough) have the sole management of his vengeance, he therefore begun with him as the Crow does with Car∣rion, by first barbarously digging out his Eyes; and in the next place with his Sword made him an Eunuch; (for that is the modestest name I can put upon so
vile an action) He then cut off the tips of his Fingers and Toes, and after that his Nose, Lips, and Ears, all which the poor Patient suffered with a Patience and Con∣stancy that surmounted all imagination, continually invoking the holy Name of Jesus, from whom alone he expected Salvation. His cruel Tormentor continuing his Revenge, pierced his Legs, Arms and Sides in many places, and then applyed burning Torches to the Wounds; no∣thing could soften the Cruelty of this en∣raged Old man; his very Attendants, people void of humanity, could no lon∣ger endure the sight of this Barbarity, but conjured him to give him the Stab of grace, that is to say, to pierce his heart, and dispatch and free him from his mi∣sery; otherwise that they should be con∣strained to do him that miserable courte∣sie: At last when this wretched body opened in so many places, and casting out blood on all sides, remained with∣out pulse or motion, and was ready to breathe out the last sigh of its expiring breath, with a faint and languishing voice, making his last invocation of mercy from his Redeemer, Capoleon then fear∣ing
that he had escaped his cruelty, sud∣dainly ript up his Breast, snatch'd out his Heart and threw it in his face, as they do in England with their Traytors. And thus expired the unhappy Alcimus, drawn like an Ox to the slaughter by a wicked Woman, (to use the Wise Man's saying) having scarce body enough to contain the Wounds which the Old Man made there; who would lastly have thrown his mangled Body into the fire, had he not been restrained by a desire to expose to the Peoples view these Three Bodies which he had sacrificed to his rage. Simplicius having seen the bruised Bo∣dy of Vannoza, filled with horrour and astonishment, to avoid further danger of injuries and abuses, fled as speedily as he could with his Companion to the Con∣vent, to secure themselves, and to look after the cure of his Wounds: The alarm was there in an instant taken, and from thence ecchoed through the City: Au∣rora had scarce begun to peep out of her obscure bed, but seized with horrour at at the sight of so much blood which spurted in her face as she peep'd into the Chamber, she would willingly have re∣turned to her lodging, being almost
afraid to discover to the approaching Sun so Bloody and so Tragical a Spe∣ctacle: Finally, the day beginning to discover the colour of things, the Street was fill'd with people, Capoleon's Door was besieged by the Crowd, every one flocking to know what had passed: Ca∣poleon bold and hardy as a right Murther∣er, and one that knew the Laws and Justice, by the Custome of that City, bended towards his side, fearlesly at∣tended the arrival of the Officers, to whose Eyes he exposed those Massacred bodies, which he with fire and Sword had so inhumanly mangled. If his seve∣rity were accused by some, his cruelty was as much condemned by others, eve∣ry one judging of the action according to their divers sentiments; but he having brought evident proofs of the adultery and Sacriledge of Alcimus and his Wife, and the treachery of his Maid Lisarda, who had been confederate in their crime, the Murthered remained dead without possibility of being revenged, and Capo∣leon free without fear of punishment, having onely anticipated the reward of their Crimes, and prevented the hand of Justice: But because that in the City where this Tragick Adventure happen∣ed,
the Ecclesiastick bear a great sway, the Wounds of Simplicius, and the un∣worthy usage of the Religious Brother that accompanied him, caused him to be confined to his house, till there were a better information made of the proceed∣ings. This good and truly Religious Father resolved to preserve his wonted Patience, and readiness to pardon Offences, and therefore formed no Process against Ca∣poleon; but contrarily excused him all he could, alledging the strong suspition he had of him, till cleared by Alcimus his Confession: Notwithstanding which, those Ministers of Justice though they absolved Capoleon of the principal Mur∣ther, yet were resolved to prosecute him to the utmost for this inconsiderate Wounding of Simplicius; And though Simplicius cryed out, That he required no further satisfaction for his wrongs, yet the Fiscal leaving his particular Concern, undertook the Publick one of the whole Church, which was abus'd and wronged in this injury of one of its Members, who was not so much troubled at his unjust Wounding, as that they should envy him the glory of Martyrdome, being
willing to suffer far more than he had hitherto done in the cause of Piety and Justice. This Alarm rouzed up Capoleon, who thereupon thought it most convenient and healthful to go take a little Country-Air, hoping to find more security in a suddain flight, than in a dangerous de∣lay, and make his Accord the best at a distance. But in the mean time the Town was in a Commotion and an Uproar; for the Parents of Alcimus and those of Vannoza were resolved not to put up so irrepair∣able wrongs, as were the inhumane but∣chery of their Children, but were deter∣mined to bathe their injuries, and wash off the disgrace of their Families in the blood of the Cruel Capoleon; a Remedy worse than the Disease. This makes me admire the frailty of humane Nature, which by an extream blindness in the execution of its disordinate passions, pro∣ceeds from bad to worse; As if the death of Capoleon could render Alcimus and Vannoza less Sacrilegious or Adulterous; and as if by this Homicide they could efface irreparable Infamy with which their Family was sullied and disgraced.
See here the paths and ways of revenge, which the blind actors account a reason∣able reparation for the outrages they would punish. Vannoza's Parents with Money hire and set into the Field many Bravo's to search out Capoleon in all pla∣ces by Sea and Land, and to cut him in pieces in what place soever they should find him, and in the mean time they were so transported with fury, that they made his City House be fired, and ano∣ther stately one which he had in the Countrey. As for those of Alcimus, seeing the Channel and Fountain stopp'd up by the death of their onely Son, which should have transmitted their names unto po∣sterity, and they deprived of an Heir to their large Revenues, they resolved to acquire one, and at the same time to sa∣tisfie their revenge, an appetite more dear and sweet unto them, than life it self. They had sacrificed to a Cloyster, partly by force, and partly by consent, but however, involuntarily (since the Will presupposeth a free and sponta∣neous determination, without inducti∣on or constraint) a Daughter which
Heaven had bestow'd on them, because they thought her not fair enough, nor of a ready Wit, or accomplishments fit for a secular life: And thus this poor Innocent had been dragg'd unto the Al∣tar like a Victim, not without many te∣stimonies of her reluctancy and contra∣diction, but such as appeared so little through the smotherings of her impe∣rious Parents, that it no whit hindred her from being first habited, and then profess'd a Nun: They seeing them∣selves without a male-Child, began to cast their eyes upon this Female one, and perswaded themselves that they might declare her vows void, as having been violently extorted; They hoped by her to raise up living Pillars to support their names, and to strike a spark which might again light up the extinguish't Torch of their posterity: In order to this design, they chose for their Son-in-Law a young Gentleman, poor in the Goods of For∣tune, but rich in those of the Mind as well as Nobility, being of excellent en∣dowments both of Soul and Body, from him they promised themselves all submis∣sion, obedience, and service: But be∣cause the desire of revenge was predo∣minant
in their breasts above that of linage, they would have him enter through this Gate into their alliance, a Gate of blood, from which no good suc∣cess could be expected. This young Gentleman's name was Lucio, who seeing himself accosted with so advantageous a Proposal, as that of espousing Polixena (for so they called Alcimus his Cloyster'd Sister) a rich Hei∣ress, which with a little expence might be withdrawn from the Convent, it be∣ing easie to prove that she was forced thi∣ther against her will, he presently closed with them in all their Propositions, it being a fortune far surmounting all that he could hope for; he neither enquired after the Beauty nor Breeding of the Damsel, nor desired either to see or speak to her, but willingly purchased this Merchandize without ever opening it; so far was he dazzled with the sparkling of her Riches, and the splendour of her Family. He consented that the first Child pro∣ceeding from this Marriage, should bear the Name and Arms of the House of Al∣cimus, which he took for as great an ho∣nour
to himself, as satisfaction to them. Finally, this young Cavalier would have bought this Michol at the price of an hundred heads of Philistines; so that they had no sooner proposed to him the price to be the life of Capoleon, but he took them at their word, and struck up the bargain, promising to take away the head of this Goliah, were he stronger than a Gyant, and higher than a Moun∣tain. You can from nothing him with-hold, Who loves th'sacred hunger of Gold. So cryed the Poet, when he saw to what extravagancies men were press'd by the Covetousness of Goods, and the desire of Riches; But God from the highest Heavens laugheth at the folly which they call Prudence, and dissipateth the thoughts and counsels of their malicious hearts, hath in abomination such bloody Treachery. Judge thou, O God, their perverse heart, Their wicked Counsels quite subvert,
Let their designs successless be; Their Actions are so detestable, Banish, and make them miserable Who have so oft provoked thee. These words of David are holy Oracles, and seem to be a Prophecy fitted to this subject. Lucio is permitted to visit Polixena, who displeas'd with her profession, was like a Bird, which sought nothing but a passage from her Cage, she was presently inflamed with the love of Lucio, who found her passable enough for a Wife, though like Ruth's Kinsman, he made more reckoning of the Inheritance than the Woman. The fire that had seized on this Vir∣gins heart, did in a short time make an incredible progress, being seized with impatience to be delivered from her pri∣son, and dis-intangled from her bonds, by a Dispensation, which they found more difficult to obtain than they at first imagined: Affairs at Rome have lead hang∣ed on their feet, as well as most of the Acts of Grace have at their Labels: Adding
that in making of Dispensations, with∣out wisely ballancing, they are turned to dissipations; and he that breaks down the hedge shall be bitten by the Serpent, saith the Wise Man. Whilst they are making this pursuit, Lucio resolves to execute the vengeance he was intrusted with, and render it so memorable, that he should thereby seem to merit the good fortune offer'd him. But it seldom happens that the ways and Counsels of blood-thirsty men find suc∣cess answerable to the pretensions of those that enterprize them; to be ones own carver, is to stretch one's hand into the Master's dish, and undertake that which God hath reserved for himself, saying To me vengeance belongs, and I will repay it; This is an absolute breach of his Commandment, who hath not only commanded us to pardon the injuries and offences which are done us, but even to love the doers of them; and that we do good to those that hurt and persecute us. But to return to our discourse where we left off. Capoleon having retired himself unto a
Soveraignty, where he was freed from the pursuits of Justice from that where he had outraged Simplicius, for which sole fault he was prosecuted; the sollici∣tations and diligence of his Friends, joyn∣ed to the Prayers of good Simplicius, who became intercessour for him who had so cruelly used him, brought the Fiscal to silence, and he was about to be recalled to his Countrey, there to enjoy the desola∣tions of his ruin'd houses, and absolve himself of his Cruelty to the harmless Father, whom he then found as inno∣cent, as he at first thought him guilty. Lucio had intelligence of the place of his retreat, where he had several Kin∣dred and Acquaintance, and thither he followed him; but seeing him well ac∣companied, and always upon his guard, he thought it would be more advanta∣geous to his design, to make use of the Fox his skin, than of the Lyon's; follow∣ing this Maxime, It matters not, so we revenged be, Whether by valour, or by treachery. Upon this consideration addressing
himself to Capoleon, (who knew nothing of his projected Marriage with Polixena, and much less mistrusted his intended Treason) he offer'd him his service, even to the proffering him Money (which is the highest worldly testimony of friend∣ship) if he needed it. Capoleon (though nothing be harder than to beguile an Old Man with words) believed by this Touch that the heart of this Gentleman was of true alloy, so that after a thou∣sand thanks, and as many protestations of his sentiment of this obligation, he entred into a strict friendship with him, believing his advice, and accepting his assistance. But his Acquaintance pro∣ved like that of the green Ivy and an old Wall; for this young Plant sucking it's nourishment from the cement of the Wall, does in a short time bring it down to the ground, and yet receives no bene∣fit thereby, remaining either buried in the ruines which it caused, or creeping and dying on the ground without sup∣port. Lucio to draw Capoleon from among his Guards, that he might more easily work his Designs, gave him false advice
how the Bravo's employed by Vanno∣za's Parents did at that instant narrow∣ly watch him, but forgot to give him the true one of his being for that pur∣pose sent thither by those of Alcimus: Capoleon taking the Alarm at this new Intelligence, and finding himself not well secured in an Inn, did (as the Proverb saith) put his purse into the Thief's hand, and his life into that of his mortal Ene∣my, who having offer'd him the use of his Chamber, as a more safe retreat, which was in the house of one of his Kindred, he with acknowledgments of so singular an obligation, willingly ac∣cepted of the fatal courtesie. In the dead of the Night, whilest his cares and troubles gave way to sleep, which had taken entire possession of his Senses, Lucio with the assistance of two Bravo's or Assassins he had brought along with him, bound him fast with Cords, and having snickled one about his Throat which might hinder him from crying, and yet not strangle him, he made him feel almost the very same pains, and exercis'd upon him most of
the self-same cruelties, which he had bragged to have inflicted on the mise∣rable Alcimus. He that shall know the temper of the Nation which I speak of, will find these actions whose recital so much amazeth us, so familiar amongst them, that they seldom take any revenge without some extraordinary Cruelty in the perfor∣mance. Lucio leaving the Body pierced, hack'd, and torn in a thousand places, carried his Head and Heart to Alcimus his Pa∣rents, who exercised upon them all that their rage and fury should suggest; The Mother, like a Savage Fury, planted her Teeth in the Heart, and tore the Eyes out of the Head, and mangling the rest, threw it to the Dogs to be devoured: But who can imagine the multitude of Ca∣resses, with which they entertained their intended Son-in-Law, as if by this man's death he had given them life. Their Passion being satiated with revenge, they could not content themselves with their private satisfaction, but publish it, and
(which is worse) glory in it, praising the Murtherer, as having done a most gene∣rous act, and blessing him with their greatest approbation; in which they were seconded by Vannoza's Parents, who boasted of their having procured the burning of Capoleon's Houses. Thus the wicked rejoyce in their Iniquity, and glory in their own confusion. But now their Distemper increased from a burning Feaver to a raging Fren∣zy, for Polixena's Parents were not able to procure a Dispensation for their Daughter, because they could not prove the violence done unto her, by any con∣tradiction that had been on her part, and much less to obtain an abolition of Lucio's Crime, who was strictly prosecuted by Capoleon's Heirs, (more discreet than the others in their revenge) but were far more astonish'd, when they saw them∣selves attacqued as the Authors and Ac∣complices of so horrid an Assassinate; it was now necessary for the Parents both of Alcimus and Vannoza, to save them∣selves the best they could, and to provide for the security of their lives by a speedy flight. Lucio, who expected nought but Tri∣umphs
for his Victory, was constrain'd to slip aside, to avoid the violence of the pursuit, which would have forced him to change his Nuptial Bed for a Scaffold. Soon after their flight they were all con∣demned for Contumacie, and all their Goods being Confiscate, their Effigies served for a shameful Spectacle in the Publique place of Execution of Offen∣ders. See here the Infamies and Calamities, to which they blindly precipitate them∣selves, who will by Vengeance repair their Honour, and thereby wound that of the Prince, and intrench upon the power of their Sovereign; this is to snatch the Sword from the hand of him who bears it not in vain, but for the publick punishment of the wicked, and the defence of the good. Lucio like the Dog in the Fable, lost the substance for the shadow, and to ac∣quire more, robb'd himself of the little that he had; the loss of his Goods by Confiscation, and his banishment from his native Countrey, were the least of his pains; for had he been taken, he had been cut in quarters, the horrour of his Crime meriting no less a punishment, if
I may not call it a greater, to lead a poor and wretched life, which he after did in the depth of misery: For, He daily mourn'd for what he'd done, Fresh miseries daily arriv'd; He'd nought but shame and horrour won, And's fortunes and himself surviv'd. Such miseries he daily underwent, As for worse crimes were ample punish∣ment. They all dy'd poor and miserable, ei∣ther of regret, necessity, or hunger, be∣ing beaten by all the storms of Fortune, and having no retreat or harbour but an Hospital, seeing themselves become the very sweepings and off-scourings of the world: Some of them were worn out with age and sorrow; others with pain and trouble; and Lucio at last, flying from the fear of punishment, and pressing penury, to some remote Countrey, found by the way a delivery from his Miseries, and a burial in the Waves, the Ship in which he went being unfortunately cast away: Thus Heaven even robb'd him of his last refuge, Banishment, according to that of the Poet,
The hated seed of evil doers Pursu'd by the revenging Powers, Shall still find Fortune contrary: By mischiefs daily be annoy'd, By Lice and Vermine be destroy'd, And end in horrid misery. But to give to this Bloody Relation a Catastrophe, which in its Tragical event affords something as divertising as strange, we are to know, That the ruine of Polixena's Family and Parents could not extinguish the wasting flames which the hope of being married to, and posses∣sing of Lucio, had kindled within her; habituated Passions are not so soon put off as our Habits: This Maid had no Ears to hear the impossibility of obtaining a Dispensation, she had so long perswaded her self that nothing was more certain, but much less to hear of the flight of her Parents, and of the Confiscation of their Goods, which were the only things that rendred her acceptable: She at first thought all this but feigned, and easie to be imposed upon a Cloister'd person, but soon after fell into a matchless Frenzy, and a disconsolate despair, beyond the advice or comfort of any.
Irremediable griefs her Soul torment, And she's consum'd with mortal discon∣tent. At length perceiving that she might long torment and vex her self before the walls that environed her (like those of Jericho) would prostrate themselves at the noise of her lamentations, there fell into her fancy so extravagant an invention as I should be as much ashamed to relate, as the Reader will be apt to laugh at as a Fable, were there not a thousand and a thousand witnesses of it's verity. Prophane Writings are Vermine which creep into the most Sacred places through the curiosity of the Inhabitants; And though they are apt to corrupt good Manners, and alter the chastest Resolu∣tions, yet it cannot be prevented, but that the most retired Vestals will some∣times cast an eye upon their diverting pages, where learning that which be∣fore they knew not; or refreshing their Memory of that which a long disconti∣nuance had made them bury in oblivion, they either beget or awake in them the Idea's of a thousand Inquietudes; This
puts me in mind of the Roman Vestal, who having read in a Poet that which had stirr'd in her a criminal passion, one day ravish'd by the force of Imagination, she unwittingly cry'd out, Kill me, if Love ben't a delicious thing, And Marriage do not matchless pleasures bring. Which so scandalized those that heard her, that she was by them brought before the Censour, there to be chastized, as one that had broken the Integrity which she ought to preserve under pain of death. And that which is remarkable, is, That Perjury was forbidden amongst them with the same rigour as Dishonesty. The Censour upon this Accusation adjudged her to be buried alive, the common pu∣nishment of those who had violated the Chastity which they had vow'd to Vesta. This Vestal protesting that she was a Virgin, and that her Body was pure from the corruptions of pleasure; The Judge who condemned her for her words, did by the same convince her, saying to her, Either thou hast experimented unlawful pleasures, which make thee culpable; Or if
thou hast not, thy Perjury makes thee de∣serve death, by affirming that which thou art ignorant of. This Dilemma stopt her mouth, and the rigorous Sentence was executed upon her. Certainly we live under a Law, so much more exact, as it is incomparably more pure, more true, more just, than that of the ancient Ro∣mans, benighted with the thick Fogs and clouds of Paganism: For the Spouse of holy Virgins is so delicate, that he is not onely jealous of the purity of their bodies, but even of that of their thoughts; so that to see him and be happy, they must be pure in heart: Whatsoever then may in the least sully this lovely white∣ness, ought to be as carefully avoided, as the Ermin shuns what may defile her cu∣rious Furre: Let tender Virgins there∣fore, avoid as Rocks and Shelves these impure Books, since under their words of honey, and flourishing expressions, are hid the Serpents of dangerous imagina∣tions. The Monastery wherein Polixena was inclosed, was of great Eminency, and full of Cloyster'd Virgins, but whether so lively as they ought, I know not: How∣ever it were, this Maid was pleased with
the reading of foolish and fabulous Books, such as are Poetry and Romances. Amongst the Images of Piety and Devo∣tion, there often slide into the holy pla∣ces licentious Pictures, which also make unhandsome impressions in weak and tender spirits, though they be onely there under the pretext of Hangings and Imbroideries, whence it happens that somethings the most fabulous and ridi∣culous, oft pass for truths in their belief, and take place of more solid Idea's: This happen'd to Polixena, who reading of the imaginary artifice of Dedalus his wings, by which he escaped the Cretan Prison, and oft fixing her eyes upon a Picture represented this Fable, and having for∣merly in Hangings wrought it with her Needle, with which she had made curious Wings which balanced the father and his son Icarus in the Air, this story wrought so upon her melancholy and distracted fancy, that she would try to imitate the cunning of the one, without remembring the folly and misfortune of the other. She heaped together from all parts as many feathers as she could, and bought abundance, besides many intire Birds,
whose feathers pleased her as much as their flesh did others; with these she pre∣tended to make Chaplets and Garlands, and such like pretty toys, in which those of her Sex and condition are for the most part incomparably ingenious: They let her alone, hoping it might divert her Melancholy. She made a large habit, of Feathers artificially wrought upon a lin∣nen Robe fitted to her body, and then fashioned two large Wings, with which by the moving of her Arms she thought she could bear up her self in the Air, and if need were, fly with this brave accoutrement even into another World. Her design was to go find her Pa∣rents in what part of the World soever they abode; and if they consented not to marry her to Lucio, to fly to him, and summon him to perform his promise; which was to reverse the Fable of Leda, who was coupled with a Swan. See here the extravagant vanity of a spirit tran∣sported with Love, and then tell me whether the blind deity which presides over this passion have not wings: But it was not enough to put on these toys without she use them; having therefore one Evening fitted up all her fair fea∣thered
attire, and passed all the Night in an unspeakable extravagancy, in which she made as many rounds about the World as Job's malicious Wanderer, and not having been able to close her eyes, it was easie for her to rise sooner in the Morning than any of the rest. Being therefore mounted upon the Steeple, and having fitted on her Habit in which she thought to out-flye the Eagle, and feared nothing but being born up too high and too near the Sun, she cast her self with extended Arms from her lofty station: But never Hawk struck down so violent∣ly upon his Prey, as she precipitated her self to the ground, where she was crush't almost into as many pieces as she had feathers on her Habit. Morning being come, she who had charge to ring the Bell, passing through the Cloisters, was ready to sink down with fear, seeing this Bird stretch't out at length, of a greater bulk by far than she had ever seen before; fear put wings to her feet, if not greater, yet however swifter than those which the Miserable Polixena had fixed to her Arms. This Maid was her self the Bell that suddainly
sounded up all the Convent: The trem∣bling Doves beheld this affrightful Eagle through the Windows of their Cells, and could almost have crept into the crannies of the Walls to hide themselves from so terrible a Creature, of which they had never seen nor heard the like: Some took it for a Dragon; others for a Griffon, and all for that which their na∣tural pusillanimity dictated unto them: At last having taken somewhat better courage, and fortified themselves with the Cross and Holy-Water, they ap∣proached the breathless Corps of Po∣lixena, so battered and bruised, princi∣pally her head, that it was hard to know her. At last they understood the folly, and to what design she had amassed so many Feathers, and her Companions calling to mind her ordinary discourses about Dedalus and Icarus, and her de∣sires to be turn'd into a Bird, and many other her extravagancies, conjectured it to be as we have said; and it was as soon divulged through the City, the strange∣ness of the Event serving a long time for discourse and entertainment. Some pi∣tied her, others laughed at her; and as there are as many different Minds in the
World as men, every one judged of it according to their fancy: The wiser sort blamed her Parents, who had rather im∣prisoned then vowed her to God, who accepts none but voluntary sacrifices. Her folly however somewhat excused her despair, being overcome by an enraged passion which had in others upon like occasion produced more tragical, though none so ridiculous events. I shall conclude all with a short Medi∣tation which at that time was that of Simplicius, who as on the top of a rock, mounted high above the reach of the fiercest waves, from thence beheld all these furious tempests of a disturbed Sea, and considering how fearfully the hand of God darts lighting upon the heads of the incorrigibly impious, after the seri∣ous scanning of all the particulars we have before related, he shut up his Con∣templation, as we shall do our Discourse, with these words of the Divine Singer, Thou who the God of Justice art Wilt never take the wicked's part,
Sinners shall not abide with thee Who foolish innocency use, And mock at thee, and thine abuse Shall in an instant scatter'd be. This strictest Judgments shall pursue False men that alwaies speak untrue, Being still averse from what is good; Thus Scourges shall or'etake from far The people that delight in War, And pleasure take in shedding blood. The End of the Fourth and last Book.
