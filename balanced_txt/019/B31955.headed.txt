WILLIAM R. WHereas by Act of Parliament made in the Sixteenth and Seventeénth Years of the Reign of Our late Royal Vnkle King Charles the Second, for avoiding the manifold Deceits, Exactions and Abuses used in the Measures and Sales of Coals, and for preventing the like, and for the better Regulation thereof for the time to come, It was Enacted, That from and after the Sixth Day of March, which was in the Year of Our Lord, One thousand six hundred sixty and four, all Sorts of Coals, commonly called, Sea-Coals, brought into the River of Thames, and Sold, should be Sold by the Chaldron, containing Six and thirty Bushels, heaped up, and according to the Bu∣shel Sealed for that purpose at Guild-Hall in London, and so for a greater or lesser quantity; and that all other Sorts of Coals coming from Scotland, and other Places, commonly Sold by Weight, and not by Measure, should be Sold by Weight after the proportion of One hundred and twelve Pounds to the Hundred of Aver du pois Weight, without any Falacy or Deceit, upon Pain of Forfeitures of all the Coals which should be otherwise Sold or Expo∣sed to Sale by any Woodmonger or Retailer of Coals, and the Double Value thereof, to be Recovered by any Person or Persons that would Prosecute for the same in any Court of Record, or by way of Complaint made to the Lord Mayor of London for the time being, and Iustices of the Peace within the City of London, and Liberties there∣of, or any Two of them, or to the Iustices of the Peace of the several and respective Counties and Places where such Coals should be Exposed to Sale, or any of them, who were by the said Act Impowered and Required to call the Parties before them, and to Hear and Examine such Complaint upon Oath, which by virtue of the said Act was to be Administred by them, or any Two of them, and upon due Proof thereof made to that satisfaction, to Convict the Offenders, and to give Warrant under their Hands and Seals for Levying the Forfritures accordingly, the one half to and for the use of the Person or Persons so Prosecuting or Complaining, and the other half to and for the use of the Poor, or Repair∣ing of the High-ways within the same Parish, or any other adjoyning Parish or Parishes, to be appointed and apportioned by the direction of the said Lord Mayor and Iustices, by such their Warrant, as aforesaid: And the Lord Mayor of London, and the Court of Aldermen for the time being, and the Iustices of Peace of the several Counties respectively, or any Threé or more of them, whereof One to be of the Quorum, were by the said Act Impowered to set the Rates and Prices of all such Coals as should be Sold by Retail, as they from time to time should judge reasonable, allowing a competent Profit to the Retailer, beyond the Price paid by him to the Importer, and the ordinary Charges thereupon Accrewing: And that if any Iugrosser, or Retailer of such Coals should refuse to Sell, as aforesaid, that then the said Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and Iustices of Peace respectively, were by the said Act Authorized to Appoint and Impower such Officer or Officers, or other Persons as they should think fit, to Enter into any Wharfe, or other Place where such Coals were Stored up, and in case of Refusal, ta∣king a Constable, to force Entrance, and the said Coals to Sell, or cause to be Sold, at such Rates as the said Lord Mayor and Aldermen and Iustices respectively should judge reasonable, rendring to such Ingrosser or Retailer the Money for which the said Coals should be so Sold, necessary Charges being deducted: And by the said Act provision is made, That no Person having any Interest in any Wharfe used for the Receiving or Vttering of Coals, or that should Trade by himself, or others in his own or any other Name, in the Sale of any Coals, or the Ingrossing the same in order to Sale, and not for his own private use only, should any ways Act or Intermeddle in the Setting of the Price of Coals: Which Act being made to continue for Threé Years, did long since Expire, but being found to be very useful and beneficial to this Kingdom, was, by Act of Parliament made in the Second Year of Our Reign, continued for the space of Seven Years, from the First Day of December One thousand six hundred and ninety, and from thence to the end of the First Session of Parliament then next following. And by the said last mentioned Act it is made lawful for any Owners of Ships or Vessels English built, and belonging to the Subjects of Eng∣land, whereof the Master is an English Man, Trading with Coals to and from Newcastle, or the Parts adjacent, or any Parts of Wales to the Port of London, or any other Part of England, to Navigate the said Ship or Vessel with as many Foreign Seamen as the Master or Owners should think fit, during the present War with France, and no longer, notwithstanding the Act for Encouraging and Encreasing of Shipping and Navigation, made in the Twelfth Year of the Reign of Our said Royal Vnkle. Which good Laws being still in Force, yet for want of the due and effectual Execution of the same, the Prices of Coals are now Vnreasonably and Excessively Heightned, to the great prejudice of Our good Subjects; We have therefore out of Our Princely Wisdom and Tender Compassion and Care for the good of Our Subjects, thought fit, by and with the Advice of Our Privy Counvil, to Issue this Our Royal Proclamation, and We do hereby straitly Charge and Com∣mand, as well the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Iustices of the Peace of and for Our City of London, as also all other Iustices of the Peace, Chief Magistrates and Officers respectively, That they and every of them in their respective Places and Stations, and within their respe∣ctive Iurisdictions, do forthwith, and without any Delay, put in due and effectual Execution the said Act for Regulating the Measures and Prices of Coals, and all the Powers and Authorities thereby Given and Granted to the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Iustices of Peace respectively, within their respective Iurisdictions, according to the Tenor and Intent of the said Act; And that frequent Meetings, as well in Publick and Private Sessions, as otherwise, be for that purpose Had and Appointed. And Our further Pleasure is, and We do hereby Com∣mand, That there be a Present and Punctual Observation of this Our Royal Command; And that the said Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Iustices respectively, do give an Account of their Proceédings in the Premisses unto Vs, and Our Privy Council, on or before the Eighteénth ay of this Instant April, as they tender Our Displeasure, and will answer the Contrary at their Perils.
