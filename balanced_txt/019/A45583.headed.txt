THE HISTORY OF POLINDOR AND FLOSTELLA: WITH OTHER POEMS. By I. H. Esq The third Edition, Revised and much Enlarged. LONDON, Printed, by T. R. for Thomas Dring, at the George in Fleetstreet neer Cliffords-Inne, 1657.
To the READER. Iudicious Reader, I Present Thee here with an Hi∣storicall POEM, the Plot being all mine owne; whose Ground-work partly lay'd in very young years, though Review'd since, much Enlarged: 'Tis of no great bulk, yet various, and I hope the Stile and Mat∣ter both may please Thee; As for meer Verse, Ryme (though those should add their Grace) Compar'd to the First, I thought them still but as the Tinckling part of Poetry. There were some reasons for the Printing it, though chiefe, thy Recreation, as 'twas mine
in the Composing; and, if Please, I have my Wishes; for Applause, I think not ont, having out-liv'd that Vanity. There follow some adjoyn∣ed POEMS (different formes) culld out from many others, wherewithall I could have swell'd the Book much grea∣ter, but thought these enough; since, wi∣shing to present thee with some thing of higher Consequence; hoping I have not much err'd, beating this Road thus far, wherein so many Others (great Parts too) have gone far more Volumi∣nously before me. But, for close; 'twas meant a Youthfull Phancy (gentle Reader) and so take it; view it at idle hours: Nor, lastly, suck thou Ill from what my Self meant Well, and harm∣less, for, though profit not, I would not Prejudice thee. John Harington.
POLINDOR, AND FLOSTELLA. THE FIRST BOOK. THat gaudy'st Time of year, when Mother-Earth Seems new lyen-in of various Flowry Birth: When prancks her jolly Cheeks, like tempt∣ing Bride, As though her former Youths Created Pride Strove thence to intimate: whenGod∣desse of flowers. CLORIS traces Curtisan-like the Plains, with all her graces, Choice Jewells, sweets of Essence; whilst the Sun (Her Lover) smiles in Beams, does hast to run Neer course, to court her still; whilst leavy Groves Resound with chirping Consorts of their Loves, By th' small Plum'd Minstrelsie: when cheerfull show (Dim cloudy Vizars gone) pleas'd Heav'ns, bestow On th' fragrant Earth those Cordiall-showr's, which cherish▪ Sweet, suck'ling, milky Dewes: when all things florish. No sooner had the Larks shrill mounting Waits Call'd forth their Lady Morn her Eastern Gates
Of Roses, Violets, to take the ayre, That still might seem to SOL more lovely, faire; Dropping her molten Pearls as favours on The under-gazing Mortall: when anon Behold upon those faire Eoian Plains Two hundred Nymphs, two hundred Shepheard-Swains (Those Activ'st of th' ARCADIAN youth, prime flower) Each tracing from their severall Country-Bower, Quick Risers all: Nymphs on that solemn day Prov'd early Houswifes too, but loytring, play Was all (intruth) they rose for; and to grace God of Shep∣heards. PAN'S Festivall the more, each Rurall face Comes in its moving'st best Dress, beautify'd (To th' view) with most fine, witty, careless Pride: ▪All's Quaint and neat, those curious Freaks thought vain; Skin, wounding feature's here; True Beauty, plain: As Nature would to th' erring World be known Not fond profuse to gayer Courts alone. Let it suffice, Some were transcendent-faire, And might please liquorish Princes tast: Nor are Those lovely Shepheard-boyes at all behind In Natures flowing Bounties, who, to find Their bright-cheek'd Virgin-loves, with wandring joy O're-rang'd the silken Vale: when, those less coy (Some gentler Shees) by cunning Ignorance, Or willing kind of stray, like purpos'd Chance First light on them: Met, both did joyntly prove All those delights Ingenious, yet chast, Love Could think on, Youths repast of mirth and pleasure: Play'd, talk'd, kiss'd woo'd, or danc'd around by Measure The faire, green Plushy Soyl, which Carpet seem'd With Flowers, as Heav'n with Stars enrich'd, begem'd. But here, Record, amidst this Rustick pile chanted one to Fame, one, whom they stile
(Thoughout) The Youth POLINDOR, who excell'd; As their Swains Prince, unmatch'd, unparalell'd: ARCADIAS sparkling Di'mon, then whose Cheek, The Rose less choicely faire, less soft and sleek Might prove the downy'st Peach. His conquering Eyes Seem'd born to Victory, ordain'd their Prize Troops of captived Virgins; lovely'st Blazes There shone, bright Beauty-mint, whose worth surpasses That common vulgar croud, Beams, more out-going Young Court-bred Stars: Lips, meet for VENUS wooing: Each feature, limb, would Love-dart shower affoar'd, Sham'd the MoonsEndi∣mion. Darling-shepheard, in a word. His bright-brown Locks, and full, in many a Curl (Their waggish Anticks those) like trembling Purl Play'd on his comely'st Shoulders; whom the Wind Us'd oft, as Play fellow, to twine untwin'd In loytring sport, whilst kiss'd them Nymphy train: These were Heart-guives, to view, though sadly enchain Th' o're-yeilding Females, some whereof have neer Pin'd to the mournfull Urne: Mayds vainly here Vow'd gentle Homage, since th' unamorous Youth Shun'd those weak-passion'd flames, in sober truth Would not brook Love, rebell'd: though else of Soul Brave, nobly'st-ray'd; that lofty aspiring Scroul Of Honour, Virtue, never worthier bore, Nor ere Young years more radiant lustre wore: In brief, the Rurall, Graecian wonder crown'd. Green Tafty-role, like wreathed Shash, went round His gallant head, whose Top rays'd towring, high; Whilst from that Role (more careless, gracefully) Both ends made dangling Flap: The Robe he wore (Buskins) green Taffaty, clasp'd down before With long, but flowr'd Plate-buttons; and, where fac'd, That Spring-like green, joyn'd Isabella grac'd.
Such was the Swain: Of all those Youngsters, gone For past-time, sports. He, Matless found alone (Since so Reserv'd, desir'd none) steals away, In part offended with their loving Play, Tow'rd VESTA-vale, remote from whence there blew Fine, pleasant, spicy-breathing Gales, to view Choice Madam spring: whose Champaign-tresses, face How (wandring) seem'd t' approve beyond the grace Of Womans daintier cheek, best Lip or Eye! Could glance upon May-flowers cheaper die, Field-beauties, whilst appear'd but blind to those True, living, speaking ones, whose Armes inclose Grand Ioyes of life. Gaze past one pleasing while He'd prove his silver'd Bow, then, to beguile Slow-footed hours, some Philosophick Book Holds friendly wise discourse; then, by th' curl'd Brook Couch'd down in sobrest Musings, till again Trod Court-lik'st Measures o're the flowry Plain. Last, Sung; best-tuned Voice! whilst wanton part Chants th' Ayr-bred Eccho, mock'd him (or his art Would fond-ly'st imitate) at which he smiles: Ah, lovely'st Youth, by some styl'd churl the Whiles! To shun fair beauteous Maids, although invited, With th' Eccho, thine own Shade, Brooks, Trees delighted! Ensuing years may make thee wish declin'd This sereous Coyness, and then weep thee Blind; When th' anger'd CUPIDS Iustice liv'st to see. Those whom thou Lov'st, ith' end may not love thee. By this, th' All-circling Sun had posted o're His Morning-stage, those fi'ry-breathed Four Well slak'd, his wing'd-foot Steeds; when Southern bait Of Nectar took, drives on his Chariot strait. What time our young POLINDOR, faintish grown Through Noons ore-bounteous blazings, glanced on
From VESTAS Vale, th' adjoyning Vestall Grove; Fresh-plumed, fair, with whose tall Shades in Love (Since seem'd thick Leavy Fortress, brav'd (to th' eye) Whole Storms of darted Beams) the Youth drawes nigh And entred strait: 'twas bold attempt, if found, High Crime determin'd; yet the fenced Bound O're-past, he enters: when, what various store Of Beauties throng'd his Eye (which seem'd before Bulk-lost as 'twere, o're clouded) ravishing; It shone chief Bower plantation for the Spring. On Youth, refresh thy sences, since a Grove, Flower, pearly-cheeked Fount ingross thy Love. The Form was thus: 'T was neatly'st all cut out In fine, green, mossie Roads; some seem'd to flout The Day-light, cover'd close, whilst others show Skies prospect, open-roof'd; straight pointing go All tow'rds the Midst, that meant their Center-station, Save what went winding round, Theatrick-fashion: Between, small Thicks repos'd; though here and there, Wild Flowry spaces left, which seem'd t' appear With petty Garden-pride. He view'd (transported) The Bowry Maze; whilst round (as though th' had cour∣ted Dull Shades to mirth) joy'd Silvan Songsters ring. Birds thank'd, with gloomy Trees, whose courteous wing Mock'd PHOEBUS growing Choler, on he pries; Till (lastly) ith' midst small dainty'st Plain descries; Compos'd most Orb-like round, where Riv'let wanders, Dancing in Figures still (rare strange Meanders) To over-look the Spring, some two Foot broad; Whose purest Chrystall Golden Sands or'e-flow'd, With Shells of Mother of Pearl; art so designing: Ith' midst was Temple, beauteous Mansion shining: Though here and there, fine Prospect-bower, Stand Thin-tufted o're the Place, whose next, attain'd,
He pausing breath'd awhile, beheld the Court WhereGoddess of chastity. VESTAS vow'dHea∣then Nuns Train, Mayds of honor sport. The partly intranced Youth, whose Soul through's eye Seem'd stray'd awhile (as 'twere) some churlish Spy Now fear'd, Awaks; & scouts again from hence Back tow'rd th' adjoyning Grove, with heedy sence, As lik'd best clouds of shelter, wanton Ayre Whilst sporting ty'd with his Beloved haire, Would fan his Rosie cheeks: when softest Noyse Stole to his curious Eare, whether 'twas Voyce That talk'd, that sung, complain'd, or what, not knowing; Thus followes it; till now, much dearer growing, 'T was tun'd to sound of Pleasure, brought thus far, And dandled nicely'st by th' ore-joyed Ayre Since loath to lose. POLINDOR hug'd it close Like th' Ears chief darling, Iewell, listening goes; Till now far stronger, sweeter those Shades passing: Hast, might spoyle all, undo; when softly'st tracing, Least hurt Leafe should complain, has timely found The Place, thin-planted Hedge, whence floated round This soveraign Musick, of Lute Voyce compos'd: Where conjur'd oft to Faith (least be disclos'd) Those Twilight glim'ring Shades, does lye and heare; Chain'd all his idler Sences fast to's Eare, That crown'd the worthy'st. What e're stirring spies He thinks Inspir'd (just then) with th' Harmonies Of that Voyce, heavenly Lute; or if at pause Leaves quiver'd, 'twas their kinder Clap, applause. He wondred oft, to heare th' whole shady Round So whist and silent, not the least bold sound From any o're-sawcy chirping Bird, th' are dumb, Pearch'd like her Schollars close; to sweetest whom Best Sounds migh't seem but rude-noys'd; whilst te Swain Same pow'rfull Voyce intranc'd, reviv'd again.
The Song was thus: 1. Away, toyish Love-delights, Fancy show'rs, Fleeting as the ayre, or hours, Wherein sooth'd Girles appetites: Froathy bubbles, Thralls, though faire, False sweets they are; Dream't Joyes, waking whiles their Troubles. 2. Lifes abuse, and Reasons too, Cheats they be: Fondlings, Bruits your partners see Ith' same sensuall Mess with you; Which discovers As does prove Your Boy-god Love, You are Blind, before turn'd Lovers. 3. Welcome dearest Mayden state, Let my Soul Here all other Loves controul, Court by beateous Union, that: Pure, untainted, Free alone Your Bliss is known, Whilst our Selves nor Wills transplanted. Let's then twine, Fold, imbrace 'fore VESTAS Shrine; Ioyes the Issue be, Divine. This done, Birds practise seem'd, in warbling Song Thank'd their faire Teacher, Mistress: whilst thus long
Our Youth o're-hears, admires, is griev'd at his Short-lived Sweet, concludes chastHeathen Nun. Vestall 'tis. Seem'd now with new Desires possest, inflam'd, To view those very Lips, those Hands that fram'd These choice refin'd sounds; thinks, she must be Fair, Whose voice and touch so powerfull charming are. Beware fond Youth (of seeing more coy) be wise; If so enamour'd with her Voice, the Eyes, Lips, Hands will kill thee. Thus with gentlest paces Like foft Ayre round he goes, through thinnest places Darting his Beamy sight, till (O blest chance!) Finding the Door, first fortunatest glance Sooth'd his Hearts big-swoln longings, sav'd his Eyes: Most glorious Form, divine, he there espies; Best Face might cheap, but Sun-burnt too't appear: Natures whole Beauty-stock seem'd lavisht there, And she undone; of whom be't boldly sayd, Fame might turn gasping, breathless, Poets mad Ere sound her Prayses forth: The Sight would move Gods to cross pensive Armes (he thought) to love, And court like fondest Suitors, whilst weak Men Wonder'd themselves to Stones: no marvell then, If our chang'd Youth so dearly magnifies His lovely'st Object, now's become all Eyes. But take heed bold presumptuous Youth, least find Through longer Gaze, thou do'st prove stupid blind. She plainly appear'd a Vestall, one of those Wilfully ruin'd Mayds, whose tempers chose That Virgin-thraldome, chain, past all relief; Cold frozen Girles (though know thus much, in brief, Her Mind out-ray'd her Body, beauteous Heaven That last might seem, this first, divine Spark even Oth' great Heav'n dweller.) one of that nere-woo'd Coy Sisterhood, the rare FLOSTELLA show'd.
Who 'midst those beams of Noon, had lonely stray'd To VESTAS silver Fount, there (purest Mayd) Nought fearing Ambush'd Eyes fom head to foot Disrob'd her dainty'st Limbs, seeming to shoot New light into those gloomy Shades, as though Some other Morn were risen, from below ('Bout Noon) though this more fair: or you'd have thought her Some bright-cheek'd, pearly-skin'd Nymph of the water. Close by, with gold and silver Tufts, intwin'd, Low'r silk Rbe, Purple Satin Mantle shin'd. The Fount was thus; 'twas formed large long-square; Or'e th' midst whereof Gold massie pillars bare Carv'd Covring, frame (though th' ends left open wide) On th' top sate crowned NEPTUNE, drawn with pride In's grand Shell-Chariot, Sea-horses both▪ And so th' unquiet water, vext to froath By rare Art, pass'd their slucy mouths, as though Foam knawing the churlish Bit. Beneath did flow Fine, little, wavie Ocean; and at those Four sev'rall corners, four curl'd Tritons rose On Dolphins backs, whence spouted all below Streams from their Trumps, and mouths, 'twas heightned show, Through lively'st colours, Gold. At either end, Forth of the Fount, Rocks wildly did ascend, Arts rugged Fabricks;Same with Vesta. DAN plac'd in one Bathing, with coyest troop; ACTEON grown Fair-fork'd (behind) for his presumptuous Prying. Mermayds that other Rock seem'd beautifying, Playing on Harps; whilst 'bove the Crysta stream Fish from those hollow'd Crags did sprouting seem Their heads and bodies forth; thin watry Show'r Thrown from their Cliffie tops, like Ached Bow'r. Quite o're those Nymphy persons. Round the place Went smaller-fashion'd Rayl, where, more to grace,
Stood lively'st carv'd Beasts, rampant Guard to th' Fount. Without, on either side, green lovely Mount O're-peer'd the Grove, whose stayres were beautify With dainty'st gilded Rayls, where perching spy'd Carv'd Fowl; though, smaller Birds, whole plumed throng The top shew'd Bowr'd in Consort. VVho not long Survay'd the copious Place, might think't some new Small-coyn'd Creation, and the Goddess view Bathing ith' Fount: whose beauteous World one while Our Youth beholds with wanton, pleasing smile, Then, looks of boundless Wonder; strong perswasion, If any ere, this Flesh claym'd Adoration. Eyes, colour'd black, whose pure Life-rayes Mock'd the poor Di'monds sickly blaze, As gaspings to 'em, dull to Sence; Ioy, Vitall spirits sparkling thence, And shot into th' Beholders show: Bright'st rouling Worlds! how mistick too! In whose full Globes, Night, Day's intwining; All-black, all-faire at once, combining: On Earth so much of Heav'n espy'd, They seem'd already Glorify'd. Whose Black can shame the Eye of Noon, And dazle that all-dazeling Sun (At least with Loving wonder) so Thought the rapt Amorist: when grow New thoughts, that these faire Shades by Heaven As dark Veyles, mild allays were given, Least else their Glories blind our Sight; Though kill most sweetly through this Night: For who's so struck by that faire Eye (Vnblest, blest) wish still so to Dye. Light's Fountains (onely) th' are, whose Ray Kindles the Morn, recruit the Day.
Eyes whom th' whole World can nought present Choice like themselves, though Prospect lent Natures whole Picture-house, grand Scean; Past, present Eyes, Sun, Stars, but mean Types of this Beauty, coorse Draughts; th' one Since model'd th' others Peer alone: Which Nature shewes her but by Glass, To prompt thanks for so rare a Grace; And that, as blessing Men, they might Themselves too with themselves delight. In brief, sweet'st Maps of Heav'n bestowing; Viions oth' future glory showing. He thought, there Loves Artil'ry lay, Choice Magazin, whence th' Ordnance play With bright'st Looks, lightnings: Virtue there Shone too; but O! these Blazings were To burn, not warm: Who (silly Fly) Playes with these Fires too long, must dye Their Martyr; for, though in each Part Love sits, yet, has forgot her Heart. Unhappy'st, Fayrest ones! Eyes, ever Made to be Lov'd, but to Love never! Her Forehead, high-rays'd, even, 'twas Sky Spread most majestick; Throne (to th' Eye) Of State to Beauty: Bar t' arraign O're-saucy bolder thoughts, must feign Frown though, Smile lightning through't: Good Heaven! So lovely part, for Cloystring given! Then strait, his New world wandring Ey Coasts on her Cheek, or so rich Die, Prime colours, pure, as Nature chose The height, Transcendent part of those In common Cheeks; had planted there Fresh, lasting, sweet Spring: Lillies where,
With bashfull Roses ever blowing; Her Eyes their Sunny beams bestowing. Here th' Graces, and here oft would lye Love's Wag, made wanton by her Eye, Tumbling himself. O, that such Roses Should never grow to make Love-poses! Then pleas'd those rare-shap'd Lips, that bury Loves first Repast, first joyes; the Cherry Look'd but pale to 'em, the Rubie too: Prime Modells, clos'd, transporting view; But when, through Smiles disclos'd to Sence, What new-coyn'd Graces ravish'd thence! New shapes! their Beauties multiplying Through Speech, though Death then spoke, Denying. Choice Heav'n-preserves, whose Sweet-meats lasting, Vnspent; nor Surfet fears the Tasting; One would for ever Kiss, seal sweet Heart-pledges: Their Live-marmulet So cordiall thought, our Youth' of mind One Kiss, were Seav'n daies food refi'd: Nay more, Conceits, 'twould give new Fire To frozen, num'd Old-age; inspire Soules into Dead men; Spice, perfumes Cheap to their Breath, which neer presumes Would purge away Plagues. Las! that none Must kiss such Lips, save Mayds alone! Her dainty'st-rising Nose, so white, Fine-shap'd, 'twas modell'd to Delight; ompos'd to th' wish: Chin! rare the Grace! 'Twas Chin most fit for such a Face; Yet both Live-bury'd though: Ill cost! Such precious Works made to be lost! Her silken Haire in many a Brede, Coronet-like, adorn'd her Head;
Some loose Curles wantonized though, Cheek, Neck, and Shoulders heightning so No gaudy Beamings, these, nor Wire Of Gold, which some chief Poets admire (And love to gild their Verse withall) 'Twas Brown; The noblest, best of all; Most comely, sweet: POLINDOR swears 'Twas Best, if onely 'cause 'twas Hers: Dim Shadow by that fair Sun made, Yet lovely too though but a Shade. Vpon whose Top rich Phoenix sho (Like Vestals chast Badge) diamon. Loves Ambush, lo; O, ne're be 't told, Such Hayrs should wither and grow old, Under chast Virgin- vow; since Strings For CUPID'S Bow: fit breads for Kings. Low'st stands her Neck, Love's stately'st Fort; Fit gallant Pillar to support That breathing Heav'n: so purely white, Bow hers, to this great JUNO might, With LEDA: Clime, where Lillyes, Snow Shew'd Summer-winter, mistick so. Vpon this glorious Machine mov'd All those prime Graces Mortalls lov'd. Di'mons, there blest (to th' Fancies eye) Shew'd sparkling Joy since plac'd so nigh, Whilst Men excluded are. Ill done, Fond Nature, gav'st this to a Nun! Next shone those Brests, which sweetly aspire, As still would nurse that Babe Desire, So swelling, plump; how waving flow, Like Streams when gentlest Gale does blow, Dimpling their Cheek! These he supposes The Love-god's loved Mounts, whence loses His Arrowes oft in wanton play At randome: Milkie path there lay,
Love's walk of Pleasure: if again In's Swadling-cloaths, sure he'd have layn There Cradled, and have slumber'd on Those Pillowes, downy-smooth; else none: For, coldest Greenland-mounts they prove, Snow-regions, which still frieze to Love. Her Armes like Twins, in loving fold, Playd with each other oft; of Mold Excelling, purest-white; where spy'd Pearl, Envie-pale, by th' Wrists out-vy'd. So lovely, that all Praise dispraises; Sure Nature meant them for Embraces: Armes fit to squeeze forth Soules (as 'twere) Through rapture-joyes, Intrance them there: Who would not ever Pris'ner live Within these Armes? his freedome give For so faire Keepers, fairest Grate? But not to Kings belongs this Fate: For these dear Armes ne're any other Seem born t' embrace, but one another. Her dainty'st curious Hands (a Payr Love's Mother envy'd) matchless are; Queens nicer hands seem'd oule to these And unwash'd: Azure Veins, he sees, Like beauteous Founts still wandring o're White banks of Lillies, or some floar Of Alablaster: These Hands, fram'd, Natures Mold lost he deems, or maim'd. Thinkes, their Diviner touch would rout Diseases, raise both Palsey, Gout To Gallyards (Frenzies charm'd down) stroak The Panther tame, so faire a Yoak. Las! that such Hands should ere desire, To bear about chast Vestall fire! Now, lower-wading still, discover'd Her fine-composed Wast, where over'd
Th' enamour'd Stream; does wreath't as 'twere In sportive loving folds; so clear, Dainty-shap'd, silken, Happy those So wealthy an Arm-full born t' inclose! Zodiack that blisfull World, with more Prime worth, then th' Great one held before. O CUPID let not such a Wast Be onely by cold Maides imbrac't. Our Youth's transforming, scarce thus far, till now, E're contemplated Woman; on thy Brow Worse fate's ingrav'd; better that poysonous skill, She-worlds discovery th' hadst waved still, Then ne're t' ore-come by Conquest, quench thy fires: Though not seen All, the Youth all loves, desires. Dire, saddest Truth! too spightfull'st Destiny! Vext CUPID long since from her flaming Eye (Love's-forts) had split his Heart, although of stone; Behold a Rock most eager Lover grown; And, which stupendious Miracle would prove To th' wondring Plains, POLINDOR now in love. He thought, he never saw Heavens wisdome, power, Earths glory truly Blaze, before that hour; Ne're Woman saw worth Sighing-breath, or passion, Till view'd this Princess, Queen of the creation. That Man deem'd Favourite, minion of his Stars, Who's mark'd for these transcendent Blessings, shares The Love-god's inmost heart, whom he had scorn'd; Though now (too late Repentant) sighing mourn'd: Yet hopes, Shape so divine, his After-story Might yet make blest, Pitty's great Heaven's glory. But what could this new hopefull Fancy give, Strangled (alas) soon as 't begun to live? He ponder'd she's a SacredSwrn chast. VESTAL, who Never must stoop to Love. Go, rather wooe Some marble, female Statue, love a Tree; Or court the Northern Ice, then stupid she
Far, far more supple, melting: sigh to th' Wind, To th' deaf, tumultuous Wave, they'l eccho kind Of sad noyse, Mourn again; weep, melt thee o're Th' hard Adamantine rock, 'twill pitty more. And thus, our Love-transfixed Youth's half slain By CUPID's wounding Wrath, must love in pain: Could tug Seav'n years at th' Oare, as Gally-slave; Sweat, grind their Horses Mills; or in some Cave Lye chain'd from PHoeBUS Light; as many daies Like wandring Goat on th' bleakest Mountains graze: Racks kiss'd, Strapadoes smil'd on, Ten deaths pain, If but t'enjoy this Fayr might live again. Could curse those Traytor-eyes, did first conspire To his undoing, let in Ravenous fire To burn his Tinder-heart; yet, dares not though, Least he should curse the Heavenly Object so. He blam'd her sadly'st oft, since, so abus'd Kind Nature's bounteous love, such Gifts unus'd She'd wilfull Vestalls servitude prefer (Las! poor, distress'd, Forlorn! thou chid'st in her What prov'd thine own Crime) still, the more he gazes, More wonders strike, new Beauteous hoord amazes; And the more View'd, the more each deadly kills: Thinks These those former Sweets, impossibles T' obtain; like plundring th' heavenly Stars to wear For Gems, or th' silver Moon snatch'd from her sphear: Who can arrest the Thunder? tamely ride SOL's Burning Steeds? th' hot-womb'd Granades be∣stride! Or grasp coy-bosom'd Lightning? Thus, grown stiff, He drooping faints, and through Despairing grief (Such Grief, as seemed to confound, devour All Ioy;, life-spirits both, that Fatall hour) Falls deadly Intranced on the Hallow'd ground. See (gentle Reader) prostrate here is found Great Beauties, and great Loves joyn'd triumph too; That petty, boyish God, whose single Bow
Can humble proudest Kings, and which alone Awes th' Universe; it self o're-aw'd by None: Sight dismall, nor o're-strange, Rare mistick prove Th' effects of Young, transporting, hopeless Love. The mov'd Leaves russl'd, when th' unarmed Mayd (Soon frighted) starts withall, thinks she's betray'd By some close-lurking Eye; through modest shame Fear, hasting forth thosewatry Bounds; does blame Those busie, troublous Streams, since hold too long: Who, more she strives against, in Amorous throng Clung 'bout her danty'st Wast, and shackled Feet; Too hasty Fear (alas) while caus'd forget What most she wish'd to hide: turn'd, off the Blushes, And (lowest Garment slipped on) forth rushes Th' inclosing, leavy Fence: Fain would she see What 'twas, yet fears beholding: Thus, as she Nigh th' very Entrance glanc'd, she spis indeed One lying there, which gave wings to her speed; But Fear soon causing her glance sweetly back, Sh' observ'd him lye still, quiet. Prithee slack Thy course, Coy Girl, what needs this squeamish hast? Return; las! here are None pursue so fast. Looking yet more, th' Face upwards, she perceiv'd Him wondrous wan and Pale, like one bereav'd Of life, Souls dearest guest; now frighted more, She thought to trip it faster then before: Till strongest pious Charity agen Set her at gentle Gaze, since not to Men (At all) but Lovers cruell; pitties Throne Blaz'd in her heavenly Eye; she look'd upon The mournfull, prostrate Object, and conceives 'Twas but some slumbring Trance, for 'mongst the leaves She heard one tumbling fall; and should he Perish, Whom Wholesome-breathing pains (perhaps) might che∣rish To active Life agen? she observ'd him Young, And therefore to base Furies, lustfull wrong
Unpractis'd, innocent: thinks now, if e're, Her dainty'st Modesty might venture here. Thus, backward trac'd the Girl, oft sweetly dying Her Cheeks (best Blushing paint) till now espying Newer fears, she turn'd about; wind-shaken Leafe, Her own Foot, silken Garment scar'd, as if He then stir'd, rouz'd for Action: till again Pity surpriz'd her Steps (nor now in vain) Pleads, brings her quite back. Doubtfull Nymph, thou must; For here's thy Love slain Martyr, and 'tis just, He live again, but by thy powerfull Hand, Whose Eye first wounding kill'd, if truly scan'd: Though, if thou knew'st so much, I shreudly feare, Timerous Disdain would leave him Dying there. Fain would she have veyl'd her silver Waste, within, But Cruelty, hard Heart's ignobler sin Then naked Waste, Life loudly summon, on Therefore (though trembling, pale, least thus alone Found with a Man) She comes, she comes: discryes Much sweetness even in Death, whose gloomy eyes Though Curtain'd, clos'd, yet his fair Cheek and Lips Flash'd glim'ring Beauty forth, in this Eclipse: His Graces still would hold triumphant station, Still lovely shew, though chang'd their former Fashion. She lik'd her ventur'd Pains the better now, With pritty'st Motion, slight does wreathing bow Th' o're-stubborn Body oft; then rub'd his Cheeks, And chaf'd his Temples, all kind Magick seeks To rouze Lethargick life: would now and then Give him smart wakening Box, till rub'd agen His drowsie Temples, sprinkling o're the face (Charm-like) cold Fountain-water, neer the place. Stout, female Task: till now did seem t' appeare Soft Motion in each part, by turns, as 'twere Some freshly Inspired, Rays'd; such sort, as though The new Soul-Tenant, wandring to and fro,
Travers'd its beauteous Lodgings, she the Power Infusing it. Or like some Watch (what hour Woon up) those choicest Wheels, how nicely move In punctuall order! so Life seem'd t' improve This rare shap'd Engin, body, rouz'd it so. Blood comes in hast, with Tide-like over-flow Entred his crimson'd Cheeks, as 'twere to view This fair Physitian thence; fresh Roses grew Strait on his June-like Lips: And now, behold, Those mournfull Ivory lids begun t' unfold Their cloystred Lights; as if th' ore-joyed Soul Knew 'twas FLOSTELLA's face, so, gently stole T' enform his slumbering Eyes, that else had ne're Awoke; nor deign'd to view the Heavenly Sphear. O Love's strange powerfull Influence, divine! FLOSTELLA might observe from thence to shine Ten thousand beauties, such, as would imply The Love-god's play-fellow, or boldly'st vye For VENUS curled Minion, in the place Of young ADONIS slain: Prime modell 'twas For male-perfection, lo; The Nymph approv'd▪ Lik'd all (intruth) she saw, though nothing lov'd. And now, her Business done, seeing reviv'd Her hopefull Patient, yet, as 'twere Dream-liv'd; She makes no curious Pratling stay, to know What, whence he was; how came surprized so; Or beg poor vulgar Thanks, but strait was flying. When, lo, th' amazed Youth (as soon espying That 'twas FLOSTELLA, that one beauteous Mayd 'Bove all the World he lov'd) prevented, stay'd Her subtle flight, as if indeed with her His vaporous Soul had fled: with loving Fear Inthrall'd, detain'd, and such mild, gentle force As nice young Fondlings often do (by course) Their caught Birds; rapt, transported much, to see His regent Star so neer, that onely She,
Sweet killer, should sweet, sweetest Saver prove▪ Rare, signall Omen! Thus then breaths his Love. Beauties fair Queen, or of those awfull Powers Hant Rivers, plumed Groves; of sweetest Flowers Sweet'st, fragrant Goddess; or, what style's your due (More then Earth-lovely, good) I humbly se, You'l not leave charg'd with foul ignoblest Crime Your bounden Patient thus; but deign some time, To thank you for an Almes so obliging great As was my precious Life: I beg, intreat You'l not yet go. The chast FLOSTELLA could Have shewn some Virgin- anger here, controul'd With higher check, disdain her new-sprung Lover, But that she's rarely Sweet; nor little move her Mild count'nance, garb, her Young Surprizer sees So humble and Vassayl- like, upon his knees, When he might force: yet (prone to Mayden fear) Desist, rash, ventrous Youth (said she) forbear To court your pleasing Ruin; do you know Whom hold inthralled Pris'ner thus? let go; For I'm of th' Virgin-troop, that never must Be soyl'd by man: Touch often's Baud to Lust. For Thanks, those trifling Scruples spare, remove; What boldness 'twas to range this hallow'd Grove, Place sacred? mock, provoke the angry Brow Of Heaven-born VESTA thus? though joyntly now My self stand deeply expos'd. The sadder Swain Pleads ignorance; does strongly beg again. When, drest with frownings now, She pray'd, Forbear; Or she'l cry out aloud, A Ravisher. Who now can think, what dismall Gulphy straits Seiz'd our pale Amorist? on each hand waits Dire Ruin: if holds his beloved Fayr, And she cry out for help, the Ravisher By Law must Dye; if 'lets her go, bereaven Of his Soul's vitall bliss, his joy, his heaven,
Like Doom would follow: Griev'd he seems to lose So rich a Magazin, yet scarcely knowes How safe to hold it though, least thence should prove Blown up: Hold (whispring cries) despairing Love Like some poor Wretch, whom gen'ral Wrack has given To th' boysterous greedy Wave, in that swarm even Of fears, deaths, horrours, if but hap'ly chanc'd On some kind broken Board, by billowes danc'd, Some floating wooden Shore (as 'twere) full dearly Hugs that new Rescuer: as close, as neerly This to FLOSTELLAclave: her precious Feet How kiss'd! her flowing Garment! does omit No piteous, moving spell. My cruell Fayr (Sayd he) I am no lustfull Ravisher, Your humblest Bond-man, lo; far be't you should Suffer the least Thought-rape, much less be foul'd By looser Act of his a Virgin-mind As truly Chast as yours, although more kind. I love, so Brothers also; but protest, Pure heats of Turtles warm inflame this Brest: And if such sin to love, Gods themselves were Fam'd often Sinners; nay, what's more, severe They'l prove, unwise to boot, since sweetest This Chief Joy and Being both to th' Creature is: Their Worlds supporting prop; Sphears kindly infold Each other, th' Earth 'bout dearest Center roul'd: Nay, your Sweet'st heavenly Self part-guilty deem'd, Whose Eyes (with pardon) th' Angel-tempters seem'd; Cheeks, Lips so charm-like fayr, divine, All-moving: O blame those (Dearest) blame not me for Loving! One kiss he beg'd, which coyer She denies, Chast virtuous anger in her globy Eyes Oft sweetly Lightning; then, faint, piteous Look Seem'd Dawning forth, as though unkindness took To be so us'd: Cry'd, He was most ingrate, Thus t' hold encumber'd her that prov'd so late
Te him so kind. Th' heart-wounded Youth reply'd; 'Twas fairest, sweetest She, for whom he Dy'd; And now should Dye again, if coyer she So soon Abandon'd him: what Cruelty To kill what's her own Creature! with delight (As 'twere) destroy her first Work! Rare the sight, Had you be held! Both seemed Peremptory, Both in part yeild: The Nymph would go, though sorry Loth to exclaim; The Youth would hold his Hold, Yet fear'd she might so: Sadness, to unfold! Strange curse of Fate! yet beg'd he She'd bestow But one Salute: the more she striv'd to go, (Since that Salute might (seen) caus'd dangerous Ire, Offence, breed wanton Spawn at least, desire) The more he pleaded still, since growing now To th' utmost Point; sad speech, with saddest Brow! Many a Plump, mournfull, solitary Tear (By turns) whilst rouled forth, th' Eyes Blood (as 'twere) Late Wounded, struck by hers; Pale-colour'd though: Or nimble, harmless Stratagem, if so By suppling Tears could melt, what pray'rs could not, Her Marble temper'd hard heart. True-love Grot Th' whole Cheeks appear'd, whilst thus be-pearled o're, Or drooping Rose-buds when some Sunny show'r Hath christall'd them; for why (though seem'd of late Full-spread) those Roses through disastrous Fate Now shrunk to Buds appear'd. At length, dumb grown Through swelling sorrow, Sighs were blindly blown In stead of words, Grief (as 'twere) throng-like breaking Th' half-framed Breath; till Sighs their Language speaking (Strange View!) with such, so pretty kind of sad Languishing Eye (by turns) the too coy Mayd, Then Heaven next, beholding, as if He Accused both; said, Fayrest, can it be You are so monstrous cruell? does ev'n move Close pantings in her Brest, since so rare Love
So wretch'd to boot; which She th' unhappy cause, Could not then well redress: Thus, without pause (So timerously chast) She bids let go, Or swears she'l cry out. When, with throngs of Wo Heart-storm'd at once, as if Skie-cannon struck, Heard Mandrakes killing Groans (unus'd to brook Such stranger Love-fits) down he falls again Like batter'd Fortress, ruine, whilst Disdain Crown'd Victor prov'd: his faintest Spirits, breath Seem'd Plunder'd, sack'd; Face bore those Armes of Death (Sad, dire Relapse!) whose mournfull Banner now Set up blaz'd perfect Conquest on his Brow. Alas! that nicer she (too Cruel-chast) Had rather precious Life then one Kiss wast! Be styl'd a Murtheress, then once be sayd Sh' had kiss'd a Man! the Nymph though sadly weigh'd, Worse Ills might follow it. Her bolder stay, That Wrong's revenged full, now, now she may Go when she please (alas) for here are None T' affront, save fixed Trees; and such an One, Who slumbering (prostrate) with Death-closed Eyes, Still, cold, as th' Earthy Couch that bears him, lies. Come gentle Hearts, this mournfull Corps surround With Quire of Fun'rall groans; take; strew't, the ground Yeilds you Hearbs, Flow'rs; sad, palest Cheeks bedew: Prime True-love peice, as primely hapless, view. Though no Hot Cordiall waters, warm Tears bring To mourn, embalm; whilst dolefull Turtles sing His Souls rest: this dear, precious Clay supplying With breath in Sighs, at least, whilst lifes breath flying. But (ay-me!) where's the vanish'd Nymph? there, there She growes a rooted Plat through dismall fear; Grief's Statue turn'd; how truly'st Corps (to th' eye) Though standing, as that other lying by! Seem'd Pitty-charmed too, since gentler Heart (Intruth) ne're Panted, lo, she'l try her art
Once more, drawes hasty neer. 'Twere pretty sight T' have but beheld, with what poor look'd Delight Her Beauties mournfull, unsought Conquest there Sh' ey'd at her Ivory Feet; when forth a Tear (How precious) steals; strait follow'd kind Another; Dearest Pearl-mint (why, Reader, should we smother?) Last breath'd most fragrant Sigh: O, were this told POLINDOR's grieved Ghost, no doubt it would Departwell-pleas'd, with so rich Obsequies From his beloved Mistress Lips and Eyes. Whose fair Hands now, like boystring rushing Tyde (Mark of more Interest, as 'twere) apply'd Their Last relief, shewing Self-welfare in't; With what life strove for fleeting Life, to win't Yet gently Home again! oft glanc'd at Heaven For ayd from thence, on murmuring Trees, as even Crav'd those, or wish'd some sturdy one Inspir'd T' assist her work, since now (twice forc'd, retir'd) The wandring Soul grown Sullen, more stiff-bent, 'T would not be charm'd back to its Earthly Tent, Frayl lodging: when (behold) Sighes louder grow; Tears Chrystall riv'lets prov'd; O Heav'ns, so slow? Hard, hardest Fate! she cries: till, though in vain, Her Corps-like Youth's at length reviv'd again: For know, so oft as Coyer She but flyes, So oft must he fall, so oft Swooning Dyes. That wanton Boy, love's Archer, all this while Close-ambush'd sate, aloft, with many a Smile Plump-grown (as 'twere) to see this amorous Duell; Rare Love-maze, passion'd Scean; how hug'd his cruell Wrought vengeance, clap'd his little Hands, as though Had plainly sayd; There's he blasphem'd our Bow; Look, look! Who convert grown, Love's self was sorry; And of the Nymph now makes his Triumph, glory. Sweet'st, gentlest Soul! she sees how rare Affection With most rare Beauty joyn'd, unmatch'd Perfection;
Love in most lovely Person sweetly'st plac'd, With radiant Virtues circling Beams enchas'd; Strange, noblest Blaze of honour (such did spy That Youth first, mounted in her gallant Eye) Besides some secret Grounds (whereof anon) More hardning, coy resolves, like Clouds o're-blown: Words, Actions (last) portray'd th' excelling Mind: These were all pow'rfull Charms, did strongly'st bind Th' enamour'd Virgins love-captived Heart; FLOSTELLA loves, she loves: keen flaming Dart Ranges her frozen Brest, sets all a glowing; She melting yeilds, thus new Love-wonder showing. Nymph, fix thy constant Choice; for 'bove all other, This peerless Swain seems CUPIDS eldest brother. The rouzed Youth soon snatch'd (just as before) Th' All-valu'd, fleeting Prize, pleads o're and o're His former suit; discern'd in's Stars of late (Her Eyes) sweet'st Hope-dawn glimmering, gentler fate Break forth those duskie Orbes; her cloudy'd brow Turn'd Skie more cleer, serene, tow'rd Sunshine now; Lightening his Heart: Beseech'd her bless his Eyes But some few minutes more. When she replies (Stoln Sigh) Alas! she cannot; yet, would stay; Thus gives the Youth but an unwilling Nay: Strives, when intruth would yeild; if chanc'd to unloose His Active hold here, gives him leave to choose Much better there: with same transporting Eye Lowr'd, smil'd at once; does Grant, though seem'd denye. The rally'd Youth charg'd home, again desires One kiss: O fy, those are the wanton Fires To lust (she cry'd) 'twas dangerous Crime to kiss▪ She dar'd not: yet could part Dispence with This, If full assur'd he pacify'd with one His sob'rer Appetite, and so have done. The joy'd, o're ravish'd Youth soon promis'd there, Though strange reluctance; loth t' observe howe're;
From th' Hand leap'd to her Lips, snatching his food Like some starv'd TANTALUS, as though he wo'd Devour those Cherries quite, come off no more (O dearly'st earned Sweets!) tells that one o're How oft! Pray'rs joyned still! neglecting neither, Beg'd, kiss'd; yea, joyntly kiss'd and beg'd together (Charms powerfull, past o're-coming) seem'd as though He would there Plant himself, entirely grow To those life-giving Fruits; recover soon Lost Eden thus. Had coyer She begun To tune some Quainter chiding, Active he Would kiss her Silent strait; as modest she Oft Blush'd, so oft th' officious ready Swain Would hide her Blushing Guilt, and kiss again (Whence shrouded, hides his own too) you'd have thought Her Lips too sweetly Blush'd, being kiss'd so oft: All kindly forc'd as 'twere. And now agen Th' Worlds glory entreats to go, though even then Could pardon, if Deny'd, forbeare Releasing: She tells, what rockie Gulphes, strange hazards, pressing Her honour welfare both, sh' had for his sake Run, sayled through; how suffer'd Modest Wrack Howe're; and all to please his fonder mind, Vain, Fancy, humour. When, the unmatch'd POLIND Bowing to th' ground, what Thankfull breathings are (Sighs mixt) pay'd th' humble Incence to so rare Divine a goodness! Twice she had restor'd His dearest Being, now further Life implor'd; If she yet go, Heart breaks, th' whole Work's undone: And, truly, if POLINDOR part so soon, She drooping faints too: yet seem'd agoniz'd, Fear-qualm'd enough, some Ranger least surpriz'd Their harmless dalliance; Panting, rouls about Her black Eyes (each whereof how pritty Scout!) Before, behind, and sides; although 'twas feare Their own Light would betray them (haply there
Some Bird, some babling Leaf scares, here a Blast Though whispering) lastly on him more piteous Cast, As crav'd his Succour. When the o're-comber'd Mayd He cordializing cheer'd, points to thick Shade, Whence Sun did frighted seem; where Noon, mid-day Prov'd wholly damp'd, did Twilight-dawn display: He pointing sigh'd; when strait (pale, blushing) She All Rose or Lilly turn'd; till stouter He Must lovingly enforce, Male-spirits showing: Lute, cloathes fetch'd from the Fount, th'are onward go∣ing: She blush'd agen, stands Pausing, still, as though Were loth, look'd Glancing back; yet thither (lo) Th' unwilling-willing Mayd was brought at last. There they might, closely Skreen'd, at pleasure tast Loves harmless blisses, feast them without spying; No churlish Vestall fear'd, not PHoeBUS eying (The Sable-curtain'd place sworn secret) when, Our Gem-like payr new practis'd Love agen. POLINDOR prints on her soft Lip (the Spring's Wood-gods invoak'd) many kind Welcomings; Yea, kiss'd so feirce, as though would Rifling spoyl That wealthy'st Box of treasure, fairest Soyl All Rubie, ranged Pearl: as would (less nice) Plunder those Fruits oth' living Paradice. Then, sob'rer Lover grown, drawes out his Bliss How dear a while! as 'twere (so Children kiss Sweet-meats) Extatick-waies: you would have thought Their Souls then bill'd too, silent Pearly sought Just at their Lips. Our young POLINDOR showing So rapt with his lat Ioyes (grand tyde, o're-flowing) That he beleives, were th' holy'st Anchort Fixt there awhile, recluse, he'd soon forget His contemplated Heav'n; or else allow Those Lips for Heaven. Th' Eyes, turn'd Gazers now, Must sporting Tilt with hers, when un'wares spy'd His dimmer Picture there (how great joy, pride!)
In that All-fair, black, sunny'st Tablet shining; Whence, that t'was Drawn ith' Heart, with mirth divi∣ning. Had that self-loving Swain, who often courted His Shade in Chrystal Streams, till drown'd (transported) Still Glass'd him here (he thought) though truly fir'd; 'T had prov'd less Fondless far, as though admir'd His Face, but for the bright-look'd Tablets sake, So, lov'd her Eyes (indeed) by that mistake. Then, th' amorous Wanderer takes gentle leave To dance her whitest Hand, would pret'ly weave Her dainty'st fingers (Loves engenious play) Oft kindly pressing them. Next, Progress lay To her transporting towry Neck, where kiss'd So long, but nimbly done, no place left miss'd Least Lips grew envy'd ought. Then, lower, between Those Down-brests nuzzled strait, where felt and seen Warm Snow, soft Ivory, 'twas kind of wonder; He seem'd ull'd there, and dreams of Mayden plunder, Rare (knowes not what) strange Sweets, new love-alarms; So, rouz'd: for 'midst those Delicates, first charmes The Banquets still in store; POLINDOR thought; Would breath his mind, but paus'd, and blushes oft: When she Blush'd too. POLINDOR ask'd her, Why She Blush'd: the faire FLOSTELLA shap'd reply, 'Cause he Blush'd first. POLINDOR asked then, What 'twas she thought he blush'd for: Sober when She sayd, She knew not. Th' Amorist reply'd, 'Twas something in her precious Gift, deny'd, Would break his True-love Heart; if granted, be His, Souls joy, glory: when (her modesty Not further questioning) skulk'd down between Those shrouding Brests again, reveal'd unseen His grand o're-charging Longings: which she took At first, with sudden mixt, Coy-bashfull look (True Maydens shyer blushing) sayd, Though she Had pass'd those stricter bounds of Modesty,
Yet those of Honour, Chastity, she'd never; But keep unstained still and white, for ever, Her Virgin-fame. When th' worthy'st-minded Youth, Part-dampt, Crav'd gentle Pardon (though intruth Meant nobly'st) if his rash, o're-hasty Tongue Ought err'd; the Heart most guiltless was (ere-long Growing pale withall) and on her soft hand, Lip Seal'd pow'rfull'st Marriage-vowes, which swore to keep Inviolate. FLOSTELLA strait reply'd, Such solemn Vowes could hardly be deny'd, If pure and reall; but (new griefs arise) What if more paus'd upon't? Harsh Doom (he cries) One Night might ruine, blast all. She again; Then He, then sob'rest She, though but in vain: For ('las!) how could FLOSTELLA long deny POLINDOR ought? what if he Swoonding dye? Does therefore sweetly'st, on her Female part, Melt in kind odrous Vws; gives Heart for heart: Though till confirm'd those Marriage-bonds (she saies) He must lok for more: Who yeilds, obayes. First also, Each had mutually made known (In brief) what, who they were: of which anon. But stay my wan ring Muse, least (haply) here Any unkinder Brest should charge the dear FLOSTELLA with lost Fame, or broken Vow (Fly hence that foulest Breath) desire them know She ne're was Reall Vestall, nor (forlorn) Ty'd to th' chast Virgin-yoak, since yet Vnsworn: We said, Sh' appeared such; though (all that while) But Nun of Choyce indeed, her proper style: Which kind of Free and unsworn Nuns (alas!) Unknown to th' desperate swoonding Lover was: Which thus we'l clear. There was set Number stood Inrol'd sworn Vestall Nuns, whose daily Food, Cloathes, necessaries, all by th' Foundress will; Their Chambers also, their Tables sever'd still,
Distinct: to change th' estate once having vow'd, Prov'd death. That other Virgin-rank, allow'd, Styl'd Nuns of Choice, themselves to th' full maintain'd, Might stay their year compleat, well used, train'd (Or Quarter, if they please) as Mayden Boorder. Sworn Vestall Nun if dy'd, that Place by order Was offer'd first (as gift) to th' Senior Nun Of choyce, who if Refus'd, 'twas likewise done To th' Next; so falling down, to th' very Last: Although, Whoe're refused thus, if past Their compleat Year, must strait depart the Grove, Be gone, as shewing but faint Mayden love To VESTA; else (perhaps) might stay Ten year, No void Place offered them: and th' Priestess here Might, All refusing round, elect a Stranger. But yet, FLOSTELLA had that Swearing danger Escap'd, nor was her Perfect year (requir'd For Choyce) as yet by full Three weeks expir'd: Though probably she would have Sworn, so Chast, Joyn'd griefs, some strong retiring Grounds; which past, Not Earth nor Hells black witchcraft, charms could e're Have shook those Vowes, or made that Brest forswear. Nor blame POLINDOR's coyer Soul, whose Merit Too high for th' vulgar Plains, Herock spirit (Mind, Body match'd, crown'd both Planetick) who, When saw true splendid Worth, lov'd truly too. The Contract's over now; Thrice happy Payr Through loves First chast fruitions! now they are More wise, Kind natur'd both, know t' improve Life's peerless blessing, since best life's in Love; Man, Woman th' best of Creatures; and by this (Chast Love conjugall) still maintained is That Best of Creatures: else Men come to gaze, Eat, drink, and sleep, so vanish'd gone; Youth's blaze Ere long extinct, th' are Coughs then, aking bones; Earths, their own toylsome Burdens, breath in Grone
CUPID? or squeamish VESTA? ask them now Before whose awfull Shrine they'd rather bow. Long may you florish, Natures well-joyn'd Glory, Virtues chief sparkling Gems, Loves dearest Story, Proud'st triumph too; grand Vniversall wonder; Heav'ns choyce Care lastly, Guarded with the Thunder. Long live, admir'd; and by your Virtues hold Task'd Fates as 'twere your Bond-mayds; love, grown old In sweet'st Imbraces thus, untill Time snowes (Though late) upon your Heads: at length, when growes Th' Earth burdenous, may you then turn Stars, mount higher Two True-love Souls at once (conjoyn'd) expire. The Day-light burning lower, Wisdome checkt Our cautious Lovers, rouz'd; bid glance, reflect On th' blisfull Future, how might hold Life-breath Their late-born Vnion, since parting's Death. 'Twas solemn weighty Business; when it seem'd As though some suddain faint O'recast had dim'd Their first Ioyes splendor, like to gloomy Cloud In some fair gaudy Day: Their faces shroud A twinkling Pleasure, mixt with kind of Sadness; 'Twas troubled Joy as 'twere, or heavy gladness; In brief, such chang'd, so sorrowfull Delight As, All went not so well: The pretty sight Would have transported some, since in their Eyes (Mean while) most noble Beaming seem'd t' arise And shine through all. First, it was justly fear'd, POLINDOR's Father here (if weigh'd, refer'd To reasons scan) would leave them Vagrants, lost To all shrouding Shelter, prove but cruell Host. And, as the Case then stood, her changed Father Appear'd more doubtfull, worse, that she had rather Trust to the common Road for Almes: does so, In briefest terms, chant forth a Story of wo To th' young POLINDOR's eare; so pret'ly laying Unkindness to her Stars, in words (displaying
Most bright-coyn'd looks the while) that thence might show Sad tale sweet; Sorrow tunefull, lovely grow. Her Father was a Duke, by splendid birth And fortune Great, own'd plenteous store of Earth (Though royall Heir to ancient forreign Crown, As we shall shew) seem'd Great in worth, renown For many years, most Noble minded, train'd; But one last Blot eclipsed all, Inchain'd To stolne fleshly Lust (nor much stolne neither) Whence Byas'd more to ill; like ayery Feather Toss'd by his wanton Females humorous blast (Bright Virtue thus through Vices cloud o're-cast) And who check'd that the least, might Thunder move: Extream his Hate was grown, as was his Love: ARPLASTUS call'd. Her Mother, th' honour'd Niece To th' Macedonian Queen, fam'd through all GREECE For beauty, virtue, rare-found Gems in one; Fit Mother for FLOSTELLAS self alone: ORANTHE this. Through Sickness envious spight Whose Cheeks late partly chang'd, besides delight Of wanton Ranging, fond ARPLASTUS keeps His close-lov'd Concubine, one, eats and sleeps Still under's gorgeous Roof (far off Ally'd) COMANDRA call'd by name, his Houshold-guide, Chief Governess; or if mean-styl'd she be (Since Table-guest) ORANTHES Deputy. Young, Proper, Handsome, but as Foul within As without lovely, Fair; wise to all Sin Black Mystery; yea, fit for th' Practick too, Did Spight, ambition closely call, might shew Fates Governess (as 'twere) th' whole Three in one: Rare boldness, Carriage Garb transporting won, Dropt amorous Spels; smooth-tongu'd, most haughty spi∣rit▪ This Minion fearing much, Wives dearer merit Might chance t' unbosome her, in time, estrange ARPLASTUS glewed heart; so, wither change
Her Full-moon'd fortunes to th' consuming Wane: High dreams besides, what honour, glory, gain Could she become his Wife, rule all at least Ith' wisely stead: ORANTHE sick, o're-prest Through certain Malady (unhappy'st Ill! Caus'd primely through her inbred griefs, though still Hushing their mournfull Noyce, for three years space) Confin'd to th' Chamber now, strong Poysonous Glass Soon frighted her fair Soul (by stealth) to Heaven: FLOSTELLA aged Twelve, that blackest Even: Although two Sons, three Daughters more, her Womb Had brought him forth; each couch'd in slumbring Tomb, Since when (some Years expired, gone) though yet Her main Mark, project miss'd, forbidden Sweet Since pleas'd his Lordships pallat best, howe're She's Mistress grown; Th' all-pow'rfull Planet there. Servants fear'd, flatter'd round most strangely of late, Run, winged fly, like her meer Motions strait; Nor question durst if ought ARPLASTUS will: Her Nod sav'd speaking breath, and her Frown still Doom'd them for lost, cashier'd. His Treasure lyes Ope to'er as Day, bleeds for her Masqueries, Pomp, gaudy furnishings, whose Golden tide She Moon-like seem'd to rule; drain'd thence beside As through close Trench, to her own private store: What marvail, th' inmost Heart filch'd long before? All which (her Female World made his, resign'd) He saw not, would not see, become Lust-blind. One Son she had, a well grown Sixteen-Youth (Not full Fifteen she bare him though) intruth Most forward manly Sprout; whose Soul in shape Less vile then th' Mother's seem'd, but (foul mishap!) Her Brain-juice, councell-milk long Sucked so, That plump'd and thriv'd full well upon't, might show Her Creature-son: whose secret Whisper, smile Confirm'd for worst Exploit (by Named style

This Sprig to make more mounting, great (if able) She felt new Child-bed Throwes, falls roundly upon New plot, his Wife's FLOSTELLA mark'd alone. And thus, no day, wherein her subtle Art Play'd not some quainter Scean, bold, stage-lke part On poor FLOSTELLA's weakness; first, she awes With her new Greatness, State (forsooth) to cause More reverent thoughts of her from thence, Esteem; Yea, make more prized Coyn, inhaunced seem Her following Kindnesses: then, stooping lower, By loving Favours (these) ere long does woo'er; Choice Birdlime, spells. Call'd forth to th' bowry Grot, Walk'd, chats it with her oft; the, as forgot Th' height more, Familiar grown (though seldome) plaies Th' Wanton, toy'd with her; meant especiall Grace. Then, Gifts, close Baits; no tempting knack, device Too costly, if but ravish'd Younger eyes, Or mov'd FLOSTELS: Bravest Cloathes too, the Father Turn'd lavish-free (so Rich) to claw the rather Good, sweet COMANDRA; fine Shows, Masquings, Sports, By which (intruth) that young ORDELLAN courts, Chief ord'rer, Revel-master: holds her train; How sprightly, did she want but ought! does strain Ere she has fully spoke, as in that Ayr Of her commandings breath'd! then (soft Love-pray'r) Small Sigh he drop'd for close. Thus, having won Her self first Love (she thought) her active Son Kind Favour, liking, she might pass the better To her main Plot; FLOSTELLA grown her Debtor Since deeply implanted Love betrayes the mind To poorer, baer Motions oft, struck Blind. As busy's He to raise, endear his Merit About ARPLASTUS still, like's Ayery Spirit,
Page, Shadow; in each fancy'd humour, sport How serv'd him! deem'd his Brest the second Fort: Not Seasons more th' all ruling Sun obay, Bodies Stars, nor th' own Souls our fleshly Clay. Thus, five moneths vanish'd, gone, thick Summer bow'r COMANDRA enter'd, where that pleasing hour The sweet FLOSTELLA blaz'd, and, after Look, Salute, kind spoken both, hough joyntly strook Both gloomy sadness too; more Sollem Smile (Ligtning 'fore Thunder, being set awhile) Usher'd her strong-tun'd words: when, subtlely bold (Nought loosing State) She thus began t' unfold Her own, and Son's diastrous fortune there (Choyce, early-blasted Bud) thin dewy Tear Nigh sweating forth: How CPID's poys'nous dart (Then sighes) had  his over-tender Heart, Slain by that dainty'st flaming Black, her Eye; Hw sadly languish'd, how oft vow'd to dye Her constant suffering Martyr: she displaies His watchfull, pensive Nights, his loathsome Daies (Poor gentle Youth!) inform'd discreetly still More Glory 'twas by far to Save, then kill, Besides, her speciall self should owe a Son T' her sweetest Goodness: If offensive grown, 'Twas for the Morning-light of her own Eye▪ And next, the Ladies heart-pin'd Votary; Her Son, that others Servant, let not so Fair Innocency (thus) foul Murdress shw. Nor mov'd she strange injurious thing, ought jars With kindness, Friendship; what thoughs harsher Sta Gave him less Turfy Earth? he's rich within, Whose Brest appear'd young Vitue-magazin. For Carriage, Person, rivall to the best, Prime peice; if Mothers did not dote at least; Well task'd Dame Nature playd not while she made him: And her Allyance, Blood might (last) perswade him
Noble enough, for Birth, if th' heaven-born Mind Made him not so. For Wealth (Dirt more refin'd) She had Estate for both; let sordid Moales Root where they bury'd are, to virtuous Souls All's in that Term, Enough: besides, 'twould prove Rare Tye, oblie her Son to honour, love. The Lady, first, this Amorous Motion heard With kind of startling wonder, then appear'd With dainty'st Blushings staind▪ o're-flow'd▪ as though Would silent check, upbrayd (since lush less show) COMANDRAS clearer Cheeks: though Young, descry'd Thing base, unworthy through that Gloss'd outside, Fair varnish: strongest Avarice conceiv'd (Joyn'd proud Ambition) lurking in't, though weay'd With Silken Love: nor was so close Heart-chain'd To th' Mother, fond (intruth) as to be strain'd Beyond her Self, fit bounds of honour; though Perplext us'd fewer words, not daring go Cross-tide as 'twere; this Modest breath alone: She no such Beauties treasure claim'd, could own; Nor could believe, such Amorous Passion sorted With so Young, greener years, who rather Courted Fondly Sports, pleasures still; estrang'd to Love: Thus, suckled Hope. This done, forth strait they move Their gentle Paces to most gallant Grot, Choyce Summer house (to th' view) with Gloomy knot Of Trees inviron'd round; neer th' Arched Shade (Space left) purl'd dainty'st Chrystall Founts, display'd Quite round too, carv'd work; Birds chirping there Through liquid Art, 'twas streaming Theater; Fine Statues mixt: what various wanton sport Through murmuring Spouts! like THETIS watry Court: Though the House with curious Imagery shin'd, Paintings, Rock-work. Where plac'd (thing so design'd) Rare Musick-strains, those lower earthly Sphears, In parts saluted her, flow'd to her eares
Like well-conjoyned Streams in one full Tide Of Heav'n-born Sweetness; or the ayre did glide, As would to Storms prove hushing Lullabies, Charm down cares; Souls prime Minion, dearest This, Which hugs her oft to pleasing Extasie: Best, purest Image too, since Harmony Makes up th' Admired Soul. Lo, how each Passion Those tuned forth, how Languag'd various fashion! Joy, sprightfull mirth, complaint! How lastly prove Soul-melters, soften th' Heart (as 'twere) to Love! These curious Hands were follow'd by Voyce-quires, From artfull'st, well-tun'd Brests (those Speaking fires) Yet more t' enflame; cherish sweet Love-desires. First Song was thus: What is Beauty without Love? Dainty'st Mixtures fruitless prove, Vnless by others Tasted: Those Riches poor felicity Give th' Owner, till imploy'd they be, And seasonably wasted. Like Shadowes, Rainbow-cloudes th'are gone Your Red and White; tis dear fruition Heightens all; most Active known, When 'tis most Passive, your Condition, Thus, lost Kisses prove your owr. Whilst Youth, Beauty, Summers Gem Do vaunt thee growing, Ripe and luscious as yet showing; Hang not till thou rot'st oth' Stem. Hasty Autum scatters all Your pride, and well-pearch'd Glory; Those to Earth despised fall, When you too late are sorry. Froward Coyness then remove; Reap Beauties end, Reap Beauties dearest end, Sweet'st sweets of Love.
Next, walking forth, strait warbled through the Grove Cleer sprightfully'st Cornets, which for mast'ry strove, Pearch'd 'mongst the Boughs, a loft; now Single-sound∣ing Each others various Noats while seem'd rebounding Lik dandling Ecchoes; quaintly florishd o're Their last strains, adding newer Points to th' store (Circle wise lodg'd) still answering round, by course; Till rouz'd from her deep Marble Cell (perforce) Nymph ECCHO, turned wanton pratler too. Then, joyning all in Oe, seem'd Ravish now Th' Ayre with their vigorous shrill Sounds, fright the (Shades; Whilst horrid fear those Plumed Fry invades Through thei green bowry Cabins. These, for close, Seem'd swallow'd up by Sackboats (joyn'd with those Wild goblin-throats) Recorders, big-mouth'd Shalms; To which (ere-long) an Antick of Wood-dames, Satyrs rush'd nimbly forth (those ruder Lovers) In sprightfully'st, frisking Dance; with Leavy covers, Flow'r-wreath'd the Nymphs, whilst tayl'd & hayry-skin'd The Men; their Hornes and Hoofes to each assign'd; Pipes too, though Hunting darts the Women brought. What wanton postures, Liquorish kissings oft! Strange giddy freaks! whilst, mounted 'bove all eyes, Their Musick seem'd th' Olimpick Waits oth' skies. In all these Feats ORDELLAN with best skill Pay'd his observance-tribute, homage still, Duty-devotions, as his vitall Being Giv'n chiefly for that end; Love-poem fleeing (Since most Ingenious-fancy'd brain, as could Stand with those years, best Education's mould) Sometime by's Mother to his Mistress eare: At length Sick chamber kept, does slily there Befool his Night-cap, health, whilst former Road (Gifts, favours still) the good COMANDRA trode. And when, more rarely though, her Suit renew'd, FLOSTELLA still would ward it thus, delude
With gentle fence: Her Son's approv'd desert Nought questioning, but doubtfull fickle Heart Through wav'ring Youth; her own much Greeness too She pleads, nor that (intruth) her Fancy knew, Whom yet could well affect, more Mayden-cold: Her Father's dangerous frown, last. When th' o're-bold COMANDRA smil'd, look careless; thus reply'd: That, were they once Betroth'd by Vowes, and ty'd, Wedding-time come, when fit to make th' relation, Discovery; her pow'rfull Breath, perswasion, FLOSTELLA'S fixed Love, her Son's gain'd Favour Should eas'ly mould the Duke. Yet seem'd to waver The doubtfull Lady, cry'd, She fear'd; some rare Change hoping still, event: such th' amorous War, Siege lingred on, with no small Battery, Till three compleat Years progres'd through the Sky. Wherein th' o're-bold ORDELLAN had so long Play'd Loves part, torturings, more pow'rfull, strong Those amorous Heats, desires, grown Elder now; Heighten'd through Hope (th' improv'd FLOSTELLA (too Shewing all Ravishment as 'twere, a Beauty Drest round with dart-like Flames, commanding duty) That he plain felt the Rack (just, sollemn curse!) True, sober Fires: which vex'd COMANDRA worse. Thus had she her precious time, cost, Magick-brain Strow'd fondly on, th' expected Crop to gain, Though reap'd but whirling Wind; untill she saw FLOSTELLA now (Ripe-grown) past childish awe, Woman arriv'd: more Years caus'd germinate More wisdome too: much slighter Answers sate Pearch'd on her tongue, she deem'd; does therefore now Wholy give o're, dispair: her furrow'd Brow Hides couched Ruine in't. Though deadly'st fashion Rais'd, heighten'd all, that scornfull Indignation To be ere long o're-top'd, much shorter rein'd (Yet chief, grand Lady-regent oth' Boords end)
Thing Fatall, loathsome; thus, Hell she are trying Black, surer waies, The poor FLOSTELLA'S dying. And then she could more closely Ingraft her Son To ARPLASTUS heart (she thought) much easier won, Plant him the Heir; since nearest blood could boast But one lost Vncle, long since thought a Ghost. Nor carry'd she her Spleen so deeply inter'd, But that FLOSTELLA saw it Flash, and feard. Thus then, some few Weeks after (to be brief) The Ladies Head and Side much pain'd through Grief, Joyn'd watchings; Broath bespoke, at length espy'd, And th' Mayd ask'd, why so long? Who quick reply'd, COMANDRA season'd it: most jealous Qualm Strait seiz'd her Brest; when clozing doors, oth' same Small part her little Dog she gives, who lies Pining some half an hour, then rouls and Dies. Death honour'd! first, his Soveraign Ladies Taster, Then, dearest lifes Reprive. This Object cast her So deeply intranced, that she doubted nigh Whether yet liv'd; whose mournfull Corps lay by, Hers, or that little Dog's (beloved so) Damp'd with Griefs suddain rising , as though 'Twere not the Dog's, but meer her Ghostly Dream; And all but Cheat, imagin'd Life did seem, Gaspings at best: as Heav'ns loath'd Eye-sore, Earths troublous Burden, now, she seem'd deplore. Nought but death's ghostly Masque, tombs, fables, shrouds (Knells, groans the dismall Musick too't) o're-clouds Her sickly Brain, her thoughts seem'd t'over-cast. Nor durst she' midst these fears, this Stormy blast Mutter at all, complain, such Th' others power O're her charm'd Father known, first very hour She should but Lyer seem, as meerly checkt O're-saucy his Delights; the sad effect Through whose dire hellish hate, but Hell-life mere; COMANDRAS rage thence doubled: staying howe're.
She surely dy'd too: Tenant grown at will Her doubtfull poor Soul seem'd, that Fatall wheel Th' Whore wanton ord'ring. Thus, like Sorrow's Spouse, Death's mournfull Bride she sate (though then allowes Those Two such amiablest sweetest Grace, Triumphant both appear'd) dark round's the Place As Night (she thought) except kind Beam from Heaven, Close Voyce; FLOSTELLA, Hope: when as 'twere given New spirit (Young years were never more discreet) She rouz'd for speedy Flight, and, strait up-knit Small Linnen pile, with precious Iewell-box In her large-compast Skarf, with hast sh' unlocks Back-door, to th' Gardens shaded side well leading (What sweet-cast Lightnings round, espialls dreading!) So through long arched Bow'r (where, if descry'd, Sh' had then but Walking seem'd) does smoothly glide (Oft glancings back) to th' Gardens Postern-door. Thence, muffled strait, the fields she travers'd o're Towards her dearest Nurse ARDINAS Farm, Some Mile remote; whom stragling took by th' arm (By blest chance) hales to th' shrouding Hedge, runs o're Her sad Tale, weepingly (whose full Tear score Nurse dropt agen as fast) conjur'd that hour Sh'd lead her tow'rds th' admired Vestall Bow'r (PLEDORA call'd her name) as Orphan there Procur'd her enter'd Nun of Choyce for th' year Of liking; whose Expence to undergo Gold-coynd she nimbly shews, for Future though Iewels, two thousand pound low-rated price; Mothers last Blessing, Milk as 'twere (th' all-wise Heav'n prompting so) 'gainst some such needy hour T' uphold poor drooping Life: these to her pow'r ARDINA still should vent: Thus, forth they rash'd Like loos'd Winds▪ postingly. Least also crush'd
(Ere long) her hop'd-for Fortunes into ayre, Strong-grounded thought (COMANDRA'S busie care No doubt) that she was Dead, Surpriz'd or lost (No Poyson, flights cause, mention'd though, 'twould cost But more Hate thence from Both) next Rurall stray, Well-see'd, bore this t'her Father, pen'd by th' way. My Lord, your poor FLOSTELLA far Is wander'd, why, Time may declare: Heavnn knowes the Reasons, yet nor Place, Time, Grief, shall filiall thoughts deface: She's living, safe; Fates kinder doom (Return'd) may make your House her Tomb FLOSTELLA. Thus, Coach'd ere long, Both lodg'd the second Night Ith' Vestall Grove; where (lo) with sad Delight Sh' had strow'd her Mayde hours (Recluse) till now, What Joy such churlish Fate would yeild, allow. This Story told, with many a Sigh, those grief Perfumes, whose nimblest Eccho still (as if Then doing) kind POLINDOR seem'd; t'umbraid Stars crosness too, his cloudier Map's display'd. His Father was a Duke, of highest Blood, Fortune, estate to boot, though joyntly show'd More high Parts spirit (whose royall Ancestor Wore THRACIAS Crown, till over-powr'd by war Fleld hither) one, those weighty Affairs of State Could bear, as well as burly Honours weight, Meer load of Titles; brave, transcendent Mind, Free, courteous, popular; with which combin'd Well-languag'd Travayler's deserved praise: ORTHERIS call'd. Who, th' old King's peacefull daies, Shone Glorious, lofty'st prime Court-constellation For fourteen years; till foul Ecclipse, privation Caus'd through that Young ignoblest King, at last: Who soon o're-clouding him, with others, plac'd
Fond Minions circling Stars about his Throne; Base Meter-souls, could sooth and fawn upon His humorous Vices, flash their seeming Worth: Whereas ORTHERIS truly Blaz'd, shone forth To th' Grecian world. But hence his Honour'd browes Blow'd deeply'st, th' Heart to boot, endeared Spouse Clouded by churlish Death, KALASPE fair; In whose Breath seem'd to breath, his Bosome-star Shot low as th' earthy Vrn; whose galant June For years, for splendid beauty, goodly'st Noon Not yet o're past: though fearfull'st Aggravation (To th' utmost Height) the strange and dismall fashion. Since thus it was: ORTHERIS being retir'd For some few weeks, with's most Belov'd, admir'd (What time her Paint, and gaudy'st Springtide-dress Th' Earth wore) for quiets calm, repose, and ease To small Park lodge; surmounting ox of pleasure For Deer, moist skled Fry, outlandish treasure Of strangest tame Beasts, Fowl (convoy'd plantation From divers Shores) that 'twas th' accomplish'd Station Of Solace, those Five Sences Sommer-bow'r: Through change of Prospect mov'd, entic'd one hour (Natures prime Picture-draught, th' Eyes Second-course Repast, as 'twere, for Hills, Dales, Fountain-scource, Chrystall cheek'd Rivers too, Woods shady-lin'd (Choyce, curious Maze as 'twere forth, Seeing design'd) Both Dove-like roved forth beyond the pale To planted Myrtle-walk, cool whispering Gal Invighting, little Dog their onely Train. VVhere, walking closely link'd, scour'd up the Plain Behind their backs (strong Whirlwind-like to th' eares) Coach and six horse, with Five arm'd Cavaliers: All which, like Thunder-bolts, to th' shaded ground Leap'd rushing forth; Two with their Chief surround The brave ORTHERIS strait whose Poyniard warded Many dire killing thrust, his back Oak-guarded
(Through Heav'ns wise providence) oft fenc'd with death; Though fought much more for sweet KALASPES (breath Then for his own: Ah, Caytiff, villain (crying That Chief) defray th' old mortall Score; th' art Dying. Now gap'd his Wounds, wide Ports resembling so For Life's sad marching forth, displaying though His crimson Colours round; whilst th' other bore Mouth-stop'd KALASPE, glancing back, still more With dismall'st eyes her ghastly Lord pursuing (As would those dear Love-token Balls, with viewing, Toss on his Brest, though th' Body seiz'd, deny'd) To their Coach-den: which by their Chief espy'd, Those Three, ORTHERIS couched left for dead, Death's prostrate Pris'ner; back the Tigres fled To their secured Prey, drove, hurry'd on. Soon after, taught both Rocks and Woods to groan Loud Page, shrill Woman both (at once arriving) With their Laments; forth strait the Keeper driving Through th' horrid Summons noyse to the gloomy place Strange View, strange mournfull out-cry, Consort 'twas. The Woman, wildly roaming here and there, Call'd to her Lady round, whose grieved Eare Meets onely still her Tongues redoubled voyce; Back-eccho'd Moans: Those others nimbly hoyse To th' Lodge their Herse-like postur'd, dying Lord; Whose Soul and Bodies dearest joyn'd accord Best care preserves, till skilfull'st Surgeon came: Mean-while, Horse scour'd the Plains, KALASPES name Hills, Woods rebounded oft, most pleas'd to chant That loved Tone, though senseless, ignorant Where she's become: All parties feigning still To th' languishing ORTHERIS, that she's ill Through fright-bred Feaver; but Recover'd, found; Ask'd, talk'd of him: yea suttlest Letters crown'd Report, Fordg'd by her Womans Mimick hand. Thus, Hopefull strength (at last) good spirits gain'd,
Couched most broad awake, one solemn Night; When plump-cheekd CINTHIAS flaring Beauty, light Tinssell'd as 'twere the Room; 'bout Midnights hour; His Curtain (lo) was open rash'd, by pow'r Horrid, unseen; when strait before him stands KALASPS truest Shape, those very Hands, Those Cheeks, Lips, Eyes (those richer cloaths to boot) But such transformed, piteous Lump to th' foot Of quondam Beauty, lamentable Mass, Best known to th' poor ORTHERIS sure it was; Himself worse Ghost become: Heav'n darken'd there Might seem (to th' view) smal doomsdaies draught appear Such monstrous cloudy Ecclipse. The mournfull Best Her Hand first beating (lo) to th' injur'd Rest Then sadly points, th' whole Crimson Body round (Cloaths torn) what Bruises, gashings there abound (Strange, dismall Fate!) whilst bleaker-cheeked Moon Turn'd Qualmish at the sight, Stars seem'd to shun The horrour, Wink'd, He's meerly raging, wild; Call'd to her, Rouz'd to grasp, though then beguild His trembling Hand, like Vapour, fume she fled: Concludes for certain now she's butcher'd, Dead: Who vanishing strait shrunk to thinnest Ayre, To th' room Men frighted (Goblin-like) repair. The ground of all was thus: That Captain-mate Oth' surly Crew, for point of Rank, estate Might once seem partly Eminent; beside, Had sought the Fair KALASPE for his Bride (LURGANOR call'd by name) but Base of Soul: Who soon discharg'd, rejected grown, as Moal, Blind Son oth' Earth; deboistest lump for vice (Foul, ugly'st Quarrels too, ere lost this Prize, 'Tween him and th' young ORTHERIS) both he hates How deadly! pray'd to th' Goddess Vegeance, Fates. Thus, almost melted quite through Riot, now, He Mints th' whole Remnant-store (to th' very Plow)
All into currant Cash, good Horse-command Late got by Bribes in Foraign CIPRUS Land; So jog'd with those well match'd Comrades, to th' next Port-town, for Sea: though humorous, heart-vext, Bade th' Coachman drive some half-mile wide, below, He'd view that Quaintest Lodge, far off, bestow Some fresh-stamp'd Cursing Coyn on it, and them At finall parting: where that double Gem For Love, perfections Worth (ere long) descry'd, Walking Intwin'd, how rare those odds beside! He Fiend-like rouz'd himself, s 'twere, 'gainst Heaven, Belch'd forth strange Stratagem (that very Even All leaving too the Realm) thus, up they drive; ORTHERIS layd for Dead, She's seiz'd alive: Whom hurry'd post beyond th' ARCADIAN bound (Ere long) to bordring LACE DEMON ground, Wild woody Rock, cull'd out, for savage Heart Meet dismall Skaffold, Stage; where (formost part Of study'd vengeance) Grim LURGANOR sought, Mouth stop'd, to Ravish her: these words full oft Belch'd forth, He'd make hers paultry Whore, at least, Though not his Wife: same vow'd th' Assistant rest. Now, neer the Act, when wandring almost flies Her poor Soul forth, in sighing Gale, to Skies; Loud Huntsmen scar'd his Lust, came drawing nigh tem: Her death was vow'd, least blood though, corps delcry them, Confirm'd, that Towring Rock (to th' full) would make Death's batt'ring riddance, safe triumphant Wrack; Her dainty'st Body, Blood (as of no price) Trash-like thrown down, Rich-dy'd the Precipice. Their Hackney-man, that former Vision o're, Drove by the Lodge, and th' keeper's Boy (met lower) Informed how he saw her mangled, slain; Whence sadly told t' ORTHERIS eare again. Her follow'd too (prime Curse) his onely Daughter, Gem, bright DORISBE, Corps become soon after;
Though th' early-blowing Rose of GREECE allow'd, Aged Fifteen. Through Sorrowes blackest Cloud Lost, overwhelm'd, Live-bury'd thus awhile, Recluse; much crazed Mind and Body still (Besides that wondrous Humour of Extreams, T' one leaps to th' other oft, like PHoeBUS Beams Slunk down to th' Vnder-earth) from State he falls; Seeks out, th' World deadly loath'd, those homely Walls Of Swains, for gilded Pomp and vast, a Nook; Soft Springs, 'lone pensive Shades, and murmuring Brook (That Life most quiet, plain, and harmless prais'd) Took pretty smaller Grange, where onely graz'd For's houshold, pleasure: Nor this Life must shun (This mean Outworld) as yet, his Darling-son The Lord POLINDOR, though had still allow'd Prime Tutors for best Arts; his Brest endow'd With various Science, Tongues, for th' warbling Lute, Galland Great-horse both of admir'd repute: Those Tutors from TREGOR (great Town befriending, Not six miles off) three daies each Week attending. Thus, Four years o're. Like Shepheard-fortune steer'd More of the Gentries rank; so strongly endear'd To Two whereof, by name FERGOND, CARROON (Turn'd Brother-swains oth' Vale) that's onely Son Must mix bloods with them; bound, precisely tyd To choose, of their Two Daughters, which his Bride: DULCENZA th' one, MARPESA th' other call'd; Deserving Nymphs for Person, Parts, though fail'd To please his speciall Fancy; yet averse To worldly Marriage too: thus (Cloudy'd, fierce) He'd oft perplex with wounding taunts POLIND, Since flinched back; shew'd (briefly) but sick Mind: Cross-winds if rays'd, big, swelling Storm his passion: Fixt for one of those Girles, and Shepheard-station. FLOSTELIA here, ey'd with like Sympathy Her sober, gallant Spouse, whose gloomy Eye
Tilted at hers agen; Both thought-rapt, mute, That thus Wise Providence should strangely sute Their grand Illustrious Births, unhappy Fortunes, As well as gentle Loves; which claym'd, importunes Sigh, Smile from both: Till strait from flashy Looks Both fall to serious Councels; like two Brooks Ranging their busie Maze: their best Props showing Faint Reeds turn'd ayery; Those, first life bestowing, Scarce now would cherish Life. The sweet FLOSTEL Durst not for Harbourage (as then) appeal 'T her Fathers house; besides her solemn Vo Made not to VESTA onely (sober, now Told her POLINDOR'S eare) but unto All Th' immortall Court of Gods, that Virgin-hall When first she entred, fixed to perform; That, as through their Joynt mercies, cruell Storm Threatning Lifes wrack, decease, sh' had shun'd so late, And here found blisfull Anchor, Shelters fate: She'd spend th' whole Year (at least) ith' Vestall bow'r, Offring her thanks and praises to each Pow'r In Oraisons: next, leave the Grove a Mayd, As entred first; Three Weeks being yet unstay'd. Nor durst POLINDOR too his Father's rage Trust those Three Weeks alone, so urg'd t' Ingage Contract (at least) with one oth' Nymphy Pair; Now come to th' utmost Clozing point, or Jar: Besides (howere) 'was strangest Lovers Hell So long to hazard, loose the dear FLOSTEL. Thus, solemn thoughts, Hast, Fear their minds assayling, Now this way (o) then th' other seem'd prevayling: Stout, burdenous Task! till lastly (shrewd Ado, Modest reluctance, Mayden doubtings too Oth' fearfull Womans part) both joyntly chose His strongly'st urg'd Degn, kind Channels cloze. Which, though't may  seem, and rasher too, Yet gav't to both  ent Shelter though;
Eager Desire besides all Bars disclaims, And young Loves often court adventrous Aymes: Sweet'st stoln-sweets (lastly) prove: Thus, up they rise; And being a while to part; their speaking Eyes Shoot Farwell-flames, Souls as 'twere modellize. As her Fames worthy'st Guardian, chastest She View'd him, how sweet! Ioyes onely Guardian, He View'd her agen; Both Heaven next, th' implor'd Guardian (as 'twere) to both: worth Love's Record. What Sighs like Cross-gales breath'd! what fervent Kisses! Close pantings, folds! as to their Amorous blisses That Night an Ever were! till, shewing One-hearted, Both joyntly Kiss'd, sigh'd, smil'd, and so they parted.
POLINDOR AND FLOSTELLA. The SECOND BOOK. THus, having view'd the lofty Bow'r again, Let's Glance upon the lowly Shepheards Plain, With that daies solemn Festivall, and sports, Devote to th' great God PAN, of various sorts; Though damped much since young POLINDOR gone: Whoe Morn dissolv'd in friendly'st mirth, anon By eleven, they offred thus on grassie Mount To th' rurall God, beneath his sacred Fount. Twelve milk-white chosen Kids, twelve snowy Lambs, Fine trim'd their necks with Garlands (whilst their Dams Went sadly'st bleating oft) with Milk and Wine: Then, round the Altar all did strait combine To rustick-tuned sounds, in jolly Dance, As thus, both Hearts and Heels would joyn, t' advance Their burning Sacrifice: grand Feast ensuing. That done, as th' Even-game, their sports renewing, These Pannick Strifes for Prizes were ordain'd: First, nimblest Runig prov'd, who chiefly attain'd
The flow'r-dek'd Goal, through wind-like Footmanship: Next, who in manly Wrastling could out-strip, By strength, or slight o're throw the Adversary: Third, who could Musicks speciall honour carry, Like some quaint-curl'd APOLLO, mounted on Rays'd Skaffold, Stage; prove eminent alone For th' sweet-tongu'd Harp, Recorder, Lute and voyce Each goodly Prize surrendred by their choyce May-Ladies hand; though sundry Iudges still Sate by, conjoyn'd Commissioners, whose skill Determin'd all. For close, whoe're in Verse Could from Star-soaring Muse, to th' height, rehearse God PAN'S, or their own Loves exalted prayses, Those Poet's name, with crown of Lawrell, graces. The proper Ground, grand Theater for this, Large flowry Plain; whose sides most sweetly riss With small, thin-planted Hills, from fruitfull whom (Like beauteous Off-springs issu'd forth their Womb) Silver-cheek'd Founts seem'd ayering view the World, Till into wanton Brok ar off they purl'd In rurall dance; turn'd Nymphy combination; As joyn'd for east, some Shrovetides celebration. Though Four-square Plot there was, surrounded neer (Three parts) with Trees, for th' gazing Eye and Eare, Plank'd Gallery beneath with Seats; inclos'd Bowr'd top; for better Swains and Nymphs compos'd. As all pass'd home from these, our noble Lover Crossing the Vale, does joy'd (by chance) discover Vncle of his, Belov'd, by name RUFIN; Turn'd Swain with's Father (both joyn'd Brothers That Shepheards life) though distant-hous'd, apart: Rich, childless, Widdower, of frankest Heart And True; for sprightly exploits, sincerely'st loving; T' whom open'd all, such well steel'd Faith approving. As first, his Noblest virtuous Choyce; profoud, Hard Wooing task, to boot, that double Swoon'd;

Those done, since full Conjugall pleasures sought, RUIN th' ensuing Day should fetch them thence As friend, or Guardian; feign'd some Pretence For going; but conjur'd his Love by them, He would provide some Lurking-place, though mean, For their Retreat till blustring Storms were o're: For th' present charge, Gold-coyn he had in store, Years late-payd Maintenance; beng full and good. RUFIN transported, pleas'd with this Love-mood, Chief, gallant Choyce too, strikes a friendly Cloze; Love Gods themselves transform'd, churl-stars be those That thwart thy Love-designs (young Lord) he cry'd: Then, roundly ask'd him, if he ever ey'd That Delphick Oracle, long since displaying His Fortune, lot: No, strait POLINDOR saying. Not?

This strange Prophetick Scroul, as then produc'd By good RUFIN, such powerfull thoughts infus'd (His Life and hers, things passed now, foretelling, His double Swoond, her Love, new Plot revealing) That, what before o're-sway'd through Reason, love, Now Stamp'd with fatall Destiny did prove: Thus, proper MINDES Silken cloaths, 'twas soon Resolv'd by all, should fit th' intended Nun. Here, gentler rapping Larum's heard at Door; When looking forth, O blest mysterious Hour! More seems Accomplish'd still [Two now made one] Cry'd out RUFIN) There stands that Priest alone, My ancient Friend, shall do th' Vniting Feat; Fed late by me, reliev'd; who, when that great PHoeBEAN Temple sunk in Martiall flame Through Wars in THRACE, to's native Country came, Fled hither; now ith' next great Town TREGOR: Nor need this Priest to share your Secret more Then that oth' Marriage-part. Much joy'd POLIN, Who thus, their Priest withdrawn, th' whole Plot design'd South-side, there joyn'd small Outlet to the Grove, As part▪ divided yet (by chance his Love At first had so informed him) not deem'd Sacred by th' Nuns, nor Hallow'd ground esteem'd As was that Grovy Plot; 'twas ample Bow'r, Tall-fenced round; to th' Grove one bolted door Belong'd, whilst th' other pass'd into the Field: Free place to th' Nuns, who rarely'st though would yeild This Bower their visitings, save once the Year, When solemn Feasts to th' Foundress honour were; Since here she enter'd first, her Limbs repos'd Firs here, first Vowings in this Plot disclos'd.
Thus, usefull MINDE, should next morn, by eight, Move with FLOSTELLAS help the Priestess strait For Nun of choyces place (that Oracle First shewn his Love) conjure her then to th' full, That, as kind civill Partner on the way, Both tracing forth, she'd winding-fashion stray To th' Outlets sculking bow'r (Himself, RUFIN Lodg'd ith' next Cops, with PHoeBUS Priest, unseen) Where Marry'd, thence she might most safe retire: Next Morn he'd joyn himself to th' Vestall quie. This told he closely to RUFIN, besought Kind MINDE (of councell too) as th' onely Plot; Since, Vestall grove for th' Act FLOSTELLA nere Would yeild; foul danger too, grand Crime it were: Priest then for cloze (since promis'd nobler Wages) Being call'd for th' Marriage-part most strongly engages. Thus, next Morn, MINDE reach'd the Vestall Grove (Two long miles off) by seaven, her work of love Discreetly ply'd perform'd; ith' Maiden Bow'r Gain'd Nuns desired place, and 'bout the hour Stole to that Outlet with the dear FLOSTEL: Whose door to th' Grove unbolted first, and well Secur'd again, unbolting th' outward Door, POLINDOR with RUFIN, Sign past (no more) Enter'd the place (Priest left without, attening) And now drawn neer, to th' foot most lowly bedng Ioy-crown'd POLINDOR strait (as worship'd thus Blest oyl she trod, those shades all-glorious) Kissing th' Hands, Lips, he thus true love did vye. Dear, dearest Maddam, how oblig'd am I, Rays'd neer the Gods themselves, through this high Favor! Whole Life conjoyn'd, though now Tongue, breath should wa∣ver, Shall speak my Active Thanks. My noble Lord (Said she again) You see my prompt Accord To serve and please you; nor can I this Hour, But blushingly▪ inform, ith' Vestall
Your Will's accomplish'd grown; th' immortall Voyce Of Gods if for't, I then might seem Rejoyce: Hoping (howe're) you'l bind this Justice too't, That 'bove my Fonder vein, your earnest Suit Or'e ballanc'd in't. Sweet, sweetest Madam (sayes POLINDOR then) should meaner thoughts debase, I were unworthy of that Highest Room, So vast a goodness thence vouchsaf'd. I'm come Besides, my Lord (sayd she again) to cloze With your main Motion here, at once dispose Of all I am, by Marriage-resignation; Though (truly) had you chose for Bridall station That hallow'd Grove, I deeply had scrupled it: Hoping (my Lord) you'l not withall forget That years strong Mayden Vow I've made to Heav For which (three weeks thereof behind) was given Your noble Assent. Supream Joy of my Soul (Said he) it was. Nor can discharge, controul (My Lord) sayd she again) that former Vow This later, made, confirm'd through Marriage now (You'l Grant me sure) nor least dispence the same; Wherefore your Lordships second Oath I claym 'Fore these and Heav'n, that you'l not force me break it: 'Fore these and all the Court of Gods, I speak it; Reply'd POLIND. Nor thence be cherish'd, sown Vnkinder thoughts, my Lord (sayd she) since none Can wish your dearest satisfaction more, Heaven truly knowes my Heart; that season o're, I shall conform to your Imperiall pleasure. Madam (sayd he) be from Love's Mintage, treasure Those first-coyn'd gentle Favours, Sweets allow'd, I mutter not. This fruit, the Lady vow'd, Besides would follow thence; that, guiltless she To th' main Conjugall act, more boldly Free, Should less through bashfull Fears in looks betray them; Or'e bleeding Qualm should those offend, display them.
This sayd, the reverend Priest through warning-sign Comes stealing in, that Nuptiall Knot to twine, Whom gracefull'st Both approach'd: And now (behold) Those Hands were link'd in Hymenean fold, Miick for th' inmost Hearts; with Dove-like eyes Vowes made, exchang'd, th' eternall Deities Call'd Witness too't: their mutuall Names (beside) Each strait by course to th' other did divide (Through hast in Parchment written) sweetly'st gave them; Though most in Gold or brass did use t'engrave them; Thus spake, With this my Heart and all is given: As I am true to thee, so bless me Heav'n: Then, Rings exchanged; last, embrace and kiss; Th' old formall Priest pronouncing after this Both Man and Wife, with short though solemn Blessing: Poor gentle MINDES Heart so strangely o're-pressing (Kind, melting Soul! with strongst conceit of that Dear Vnion so over-powred strait) She downright sob'd again, whilst wept RUFIN. Skies pleas'd, more Azure smiling-cheek'd, were seen; Bright PHoeBUS gilding round the verdent Bow'r With gaudy't blazing Beams, as shun that hour Grand heav'nly Witness; meant t'adorn the Plae His leavy Temple turn'd: for Anthem-grace (Wood-quire ith'cloze) conjoyned chirping Throng; Seem'd Warble forth their Hymenean Song. Thus, speaking half in fearfull Looks their last, Quick, short Farwells, the Lady now in hast Shut all forth; back to th' Vestall Mansion stealing, True Mayd and Wife: POLINDOR'S joyes excelling Th' whole earth, since gained thus th' All-wealthy Prize. Next Morn, as mounting PHoeBUS should not rise Eagrer to view's half globy World, then he More-worth FLOSTELLA far, he's gone, does flee By day-break to RUFIN, his Vncles place, Where calling MIND strait (that proper Lass
Kept th' house) they soon Vnsex'd him for a while With her best Silken cloathes, small linnen-pile For shift, though couch'd his Taff'ty-robes within; This short salute to's Father, left RUFIN: Which Scroul, that Even to his hand convay'd, Smooth quallifying cause of Flight display'd. My Lord, being Noble, Young, and tir'd With Swains life, brest to travail fir'd; View more oth' World, that Box of wonder, Map of his praise that rules the thunder; I'm gone for new Climes, forain Ayres: Heav'n guard me back; your pardon, pray'rs. POLINDOR. Thus drest, transform'd, forth trac'd our proper Nun; RUFIN with cheerfull MINDE follow'd soon, Just within view, till drawing neer the Grove, Joyn'd all for th' Vestall Mansion; where to's Love Th' esteem'd FLOSTEL (though call'd PLEDORA there, Himself ALTHUSA nam'd, her Cousin, neer In Blood respect to boot) as Night-comrade He's entred, Nun of choyce: though grown (as said) Ill rester lately, through distemper'd head (Such her Injunction) had his Trundle-bed. Proud Chamber-fellow (at least) becoming so, Truest Brides-groom; first Quartridge pay'd: but, O, Th' Hearts inward conflicts, checks! least Lovers eyes Blab'd more then Friend, what suted meer Allyes, Or th' female same Sex; whilst those Virgin crew Flock'd round to welcome all, did fondly'st view. T' one prays'd the Sun-like radiance of her Eye, Where sate enthron'd sweet pleasing Majesty; Perswading, yet just then commanding Love: T'other her Cheek, and Lips, where seem'd to move Graces transporting, wondrous those extolls; How lovely, choyce! The third for prime inrolls
Her Forehead, Hair, what gallant, courtly'st Pace! How Princess-like! whilst her especiall grace, Acquaintance, all with kind of secret Passion (Close-charm'd as 'twere) desir'd, to emulation. Indeed, PLEDORAS Person wave, decline, To whom all prostrate Beauties, as divine, Must stoop in Vassaylage, th' Imperiall she; That House, nor GREECE could equall wonder see: Both whom, by their lat-coyned Names, we shall For th' time ALTHUSA and PLEDORA call. Bless (HYMEN) bless thy Gems, since these implore Thy Name 'bove VESTAS, powerfull'st thee Adore. Mean while, no petty troublous Storm arose About POLINDORS flight, whose Father showes One while all Fire through vexing passion grown, As formed of that Element alone; And then all drowsie Earth, dull, lumpish; whether Through grief produc'd, or rage, grief both together Since quash'd those Matches quite: till good RUFIN, With others, fought by powerfull'st waies, Design To cool, allay; fair-glossing th' Action o're As Youthfull trick, by's Elders play'd before; Wherein but Copy'd had his own Grandfather. Thus, stroak'd his Rage. But gloomier Clouds did gather 'Bout one oth' mention'd Gentile Nymphs (alas!) DULCENZA nam'd, whose no decitfull Glass Boasting oth' Two chief Beauties stock (the Pearl Prime Tulip of those Plains (indeed) a Girl Lovely enough) t'whose Face conjoyn'd beside, Some higher Parts; and (as she thought) discry'd Most kindness, least neglect from th' Lord POLIND, Sh' had fed more hopes: till (sadly'st-breathed wind!) Mayd whispring forth the newes, Hearts qualm begun; Hope's gasping 'twas; worse Souls Convulsion Seiz'd now then ever, Sigh'd, she mourn'd, she wept. Griefe's truest draught: till sick Bed lastly kept.
Friends, pleasures, food, yea Life it self's distasting; Th' World burdenous become; her sad eyes casting On nought, but there's behel'd POLINDOR'S Face, Haunting her still, strong Fancies Ghost alas? There last she ey'd his Person (thinks) and there Last heard him speak (goes on) such his Looks were, All flames and wounding Darts; such, such his Words, Love's Notes of Musick, tunefullest accords: There (lastly) spake to her, gave Kiss-salute (O Heav'ns!) What Sighes, what Groans to each did sute? As those should prove joyn'd Fun'rall knels to all. O wondrous Rarity (sayd she) oth' Vale, Of Greece, th' whole ample World! O most refin'd Choicest of Men (confess'd) but too Unkind! Building thy Glorious Trophies (to our smarts) On Mayden ruines, captiv'd Broken Hearts! I sent thee Mine, which, though not gently took, Nere back returned Home (alas) 'twas Broke, Shiver'd, or lost: My Heart, once Ayre-like free, But now in Fetters, Chaines: loath'd Destiny! Nor wonder, Chain'd, since grew Love-mad, distracted; Too much I Hop'd, through those hopes strongly acted, To much I look'd (alas) too much I Lov'd (Fond, easie Soul!) till freedomes Ruin prov'd. Weep, weep my trayterous Eyes, in kindness now O're-flow and Drown me quite; sigh Brest, till you Grow Stifl'd thence; break Credulous Heart out-right: But live POLINDOR still, enjoy this Light. O Love, thou worst of Tyrant-Lords, to whom Death's smil'd, as pastime! lingring-sad's thy Doom! Lovers dye ten-fold, ten-fold (onely) alas! Wretch'd, wretched Lovers, how sh' extoll'd each Grace: (Now lost) by th' Body were that worn, or Mind! New-rating them! her Spirits languish'd, pin'd, Th' Head, Stomack droop'd through meer Heart- sympa∣thy (Sleep fled her cloudy'd eyes) whilst slaps apply
Pos'd Physick-doctors, vainly tyr'd their skills. Lo (Reader) one oth' Worlds transcendent Ills, Grand curses, Love, where not again Belov'd: Till gleanng in short time (which wonder prov'd) Good vigorous Spirits, strange Resolves possest (Of which ere long) her pensive, wavy Brest. Mean-while, the fainter-hop'd MARPESA (though More private, calmly Mourn'd; by stealth would so Sigh, weep her sorrowes forth, in gloomy Bowers, Like Aprils gentler-breathed Blasts, and howers. This for that Nymphy Payr; though partly now Young spruce MENANDERS heart, by faithfull Vow DULCENZAS bounden Slave, began to feed Cherish more hopes; such did SIRENUS breed, MARPESAS too; Both, fine gentile-born Swains (Whose Fathers with the Duke chose Shepheard-plains) Prime Sparks indeed, accomplish'd Youths, though most Seem'd through POLINDOR'S Splendor darken'd, lost: Thus, secret Burn'd, o're-powerfull Rivall fearing: Their Loves discover'd though, Looks glass-like wearing Th' Hearts inward blazng fires, Heart-panting, groans Sighes speaking plainly't forth; thus, seem'd at once Mute Spokesmen, as live Pictures of their loves: So strong through th' Bodies organ Passion moves. Yea, view'd Poetick strains of theirs, where shin'd Those Nymphs as Stars. To these two were assign'd (As Victor-youths) that Running, wrastling Prize Last Festivall, before their Mistress eyes; Both Laurell-crowned too, for Verse. The last For Musick FLORIS won, Youth unsurpast By gallant those, extoll'd for Lute and Voyce: Which Swain, though might in CUPID'S wars rejoyce Since conquer'd CRESSAS Heart, yet here became old Most captive, wretch'd, through rancorous grudge Lodg'd in her Fathers brest, from sight restraining: (flme) Fort yeilded, won, but Keyes deny'd, complaining:
By order that resign'd, shut up though be The Gates by th' Churl Lievtenant, deputy. Though heighten'd all this woe High burning Feavr, Which lately seiz'd the Nymph, would seem (however) Through Vengeance, Spight, to Fire th' all beauteous Fort; Worse-feaver'd grown his Mind; such dismall sort Both dangerous. And now to th' Pastorall plain This travayling resolve oth' Lordly Swain Seem'd blazed forth; your courteous view transfer To Sonnet next, by speciall Honourer Of young POLINDORS fram'd, t' whose Glory, praise 'Twas chanted forth ere long, with Rurall grace: Choice quite of Shepheard-youths, with crowns of Roses. Msque rob'd to boot, conjoyning in the clozes. 1. Gem of Honour, Worth, farewell From thy Cell; Chang'd these snowy bleating Flocks, Ecchoing Rocks, For those Climes where wonders dwell: CHORUS. Mildest ZEPHIRS fan thee o're, Chief Wonder, to what ever Shore. 2. Thou, that was't our lovelyer PAN, Star oth' Plain, Whose rare Influence rude frize Did Civillize; And sublim'd the Rustick brain: CHORUS. Nor did'st more enoble, then Improve this Desert, Herd of me▪ 3. Rarest young Compound for sweet Virtue, Wit; Heighten'd through forms excellence, More by Sence; Sin, these Shades should cloud thee yet:
CHORUSThough the Plains, Fame shall record, Held once POLINDOR, v'd a Lord Next (All for th' heel) their activ'st youth and art, To Hobois, Flutes, in Dance they did impart; What lofty'st friskings, Ayre-born motions there As each would chiefly Inspired thus appear From his Beloved's Eye; would strongly boast To th' fonder World, gay Courts not all ingrost. Then strait POLINDORS Health went dancing round To th' Cornet, Flute, with shouts triumphant crown'd; Whilst rocky Hills and Woods, in eccho-fashion, Seem'd joviall Partners joyn'd th' celebration: Last, Nymphs, gentilest Swains (to double pleasure) Combin'd for cloze in sprightfull'st country Measure: Whilst nodding Grandsires (chanted o're and o're) Brag'd this Themselves had done, times past, and More. Thus, on the flowry Soyl, these pleas'd Consorts We leae again, joyn'd in their Shepheard- sports; Kind Brothers of the flock, to gentle whom, As Sojourners, for constant dwelling come Peace, sober Quiet, harmless Innocence, There seek protecting Roofs, find shelter thence If any where. O prays'd, contented Life! Fr'd from those envious Heats, that boyling strife Of proud and hughty Courts! their Luxury, Vain gorgeous Pomp, to boot! Projection-free! No painted Vizards worn, but th' inmost Heart And Brow stamp'd both alike! shun'd glosing art! Kings have Vnthrn'd them for your pleasing Bliss, As Kings from you to mounted Thrones have riss. Here back to th' Cloyster'd Mansion, Vestll ayre Let's turn our Flight, salute that noblest Payre In their conjoyn'd abode; Nun-life, estate. We shall not here set forth to th' full, dilate Those pleasant Cabins, Garden-founts, those Bow'rs, Choyce shady Walks; their evening Sports, their hours
For burning Incence, Vestall Robes, attires; Their Musick-consorts oft, with their Voyce-quire, Rare Pencils art, their Needles wonders, glory: Nor shall we number out in formall story Our spoused Nuns day-stoln Delights. and kisses; Their private Walks to th' first-view'd Fount of blisses, With that first Dear, adjoyning, faithfull Shade, Where new Loves sober Sweets, love-vowes repaid (All heighten'd much through former Doubts and fear, Now rouzed up by Both, recounted there) Last, th' Outlets Bow'r: those conscious, loving Places Thank'd kindly still, as Capable oth' graces (So sweetly over-flowing's gentle Love Toward Founts and Trees) though rarest this, least prove Observ'd; ALTHUSE by th' fonder Nuns, beside, So haunted still. Nor shall be blab'd, descry'd Nights pleasures much; conform'd ALTHUSA though (Th' undressing Hand-mayds part who joy'd to show) PLEDORA being chouch'd, earths glorious Mine, VVould but, lay'd down on th' blisfull cloathes, intwi Her dainty'st Body still, Heart-fires revealing; Thousand Goodnights in balmy kisses sealing (Thousand Goodmorrwes too) Sighes joyn'd for cloz) As Fancy should sublimed Spirits of those Rayse (Chymick-like) to smaller dear frution: So, goes to's Trundle-bed: Dreams blest condition Oft Cordiall-friend to th' pining hungry Lover, Kind almes, relief. Soul soothed still, 'twould over his Fast ere long, mean while participated hose Ioyes, preserves once swoonded for, high'st-rated hus at her feet, like th' sturdy Guardian kept That Orchard rich in Golden fruit, he slept. VVondrous Self-conquest (lo) both sides Renown'd (Sweet'st, worthy'st Payr!) that Mansion, grovy round Virgin-lodge still, though turn'd to loving Bow'rs! None Witness day nor night, save  amorous Pow'.
SOL, LUNA alone, whose first his DAPHNE chose, Th' other her Darling-swain; no Tell-tales those: Choyce sports, converse, with first Love-fruits unblasted, ALTHUSA and the fayr PLEDORA tasted. But yet, we shall not least neglect, o'r-pass That yearly grand Solemnity, which was Ere long perform'd to th' Goddess VESTA there, To which, Spectators, none admitted were But neighbouring Virgins; joyned also none For Actor's in't, but vow'd sworn Nuns alone: Those Nuns of choyce their Room above possest, No small contentment to ALTHUSAS Brest; Since else, beneath, some Shepheardesses eye Might have betray'd her thence (worst treachery!) Nor to PLEDORAS too, since free'd, excus'd By this (turn'd Wife) nought VESTAS Rites abus'd. Th' whole Form thereof was thus: Ith' upper end Oth' Temples quire, which did with steps ascend, Great Goddess VESTAS Image stood, inshrin'd Somewhat aloft; th' one hand oth' Wall (design'd On Arras, costly'st work) in verdant Shads Same with Diana. She seem'd beheld, with all her Quiver'd Mayds Hunting the Deer; how lively'st reall Chase! On th' other hand, with Tempting, naked Grace Dabling in silver Streams, proportioned. At foot oth' Shrine, their hallow'd ground was spread With Damask carpet, broad, of purest white And green in border'd Panes; 'fore which (to sight) Small Table stood, like Silken adornment wearing. First marched forh th' old Rev'rend Priestess, bearing Largest white Lawn upon whose midst display'd Fayr Chaplet wreath, of beauteous Lillies made Green Laurell, mixt, froath'd both in spots, like Snow; Fit emblems all: those Lillies seem'd to show Chst Pureness there; Laurels did Freshness boast, Loves powerfull conquest, with green Shades whre most
VESTA delights; Snow figur'd Virgin-cold. Next after her March'd single Nymph, did hold Small Baskets, open-work, of white and green; Like-ribbon'd, trim'd; through which (perspective-seen) Shin'd store of Lillies, Laurell-branches fair. Last, came th' whole Virgin-train, by comely Pair, In long Lawn-vails, with towred lofty dressing, Mixt white and green, puff'd Diadem expressing; By each born in own hand small China dish Of purewhite, trembling Ielly (shrouded this Chast Emblem too) whilst in their other showing Bright hallow'd Censer, Incence round bestowing; Whose fragrant, costly Mists, th' whole ample place Endeard, enrich'd at once: with solemn Grace Thus all March'd up (perform'd their Treble bow) Towards those Mounting steps, beneath whose brow Their Altar stood; where strait did hands divide, Falling off partly thus to either side. When up those steps the Priestess slowly advanc'd To th' hallow'd Table, where a while Intranc'd Shee kneeling seem'd; then, rouzing, spread thereon (Devout obeysance made) that milk-white Lawn With purest Wreath; next, from the attendant Mayd Those fine-wrought Lilly-baskets, took, displayd And rank'd them all beneath that Table, round (Present to VESTA) on the Marble ground: Then, further step'd to th' Carpet strow'd that o're VVith Lillies Laurell-branches mixed store (Those white, green Damask panes) set forth each part Unlike; thus doubly Flowr'd, by Nature, art. Last, all those Nymphs step'd up, advanced bowing By single turns, and, each their Dish bestowing That mention'd Table round, beneath retir'd: During which while, those late dead walls inspir'd Through soft conceal'd, harmonious Musick seem'd▪ VVhence earthly Heave turn'd, by some esteem'd
Which Musick ceas'd, forth lanching from the side, The comely Priestess brought of Laurell dry'd (Mixt Iuniper) small Fagot, girdled bound With Ribbons white, wherewith she stooping crown'd Their Altar; fir'd the same with Spice and Gums: That Hand-mayd (Wayting-Nymph) soon after comes, Two beauteous Chrystall Vialls sweetly bearing, Like-formed, largest-bulk'd; through th' one appearing White Wine to view, pure Milk that other show'd; From whose transparant Wombs distilling flow'd Like Founts, pour'd forth to VESTA, as Oblation: During which latter Rites, in Anthem-fashion Those severall Nymphs conjoyn'd from either side, Did seem to Quire of Chrins ally'd. The Song was thus: 1. Goddess, Silver-bow adorn'd, Golden-quiver'd, on whose Brow Silver Crescent; be not scorn'd Mayden Votaries, which Bow Here before thy Shrine of price; Hearts with Incence sacrifice: Gentler fashion Smell our Vowes and our Oblation. 2. Fairest Deity of shades, Purest-cheek'd and purest Brest; Whom Fond Passion nere invades, Still o're Love Triumphant, blest; Deign thy Servants but to sroud, 'Mongst thy Nymphy Train allow'd▪ Greater Honour None here wishes heap'd upon her. 3. Brighter then these Lillies, Snow, Which are offred up  thee,
Yea, more Chast and spotless too; Shine propitious, grant that We Like our Goddess (though less fayr) May be purely'st Chast as Ayr: Thus we even Chant thy Prayse from Earth to Heaven. Thus, th' Anthem past, those Nymphs joyn'd all anew, That Senior Nun and Priestess first in view; So, falling backwards all, in Payrs, with those First Treble bows made up their solemn Cloze. All this while sate PLEDORA as Star, on high, Cloath'd with such beauteous rayes, divinity, As though their Goddess VESTAS self (less nice) Were then come down to grace their Sacrifice (As truly Virgin too that gaudy day) Behind whom, closely skulk'd, ALTHUSA lay. There might she view one well-known Shepheardess, And there Another 'midst the gazing press; MARPESA (last) who late for him had Pin'd: Whom shew'd to th' dear PLEDORA, jog'd behind: Triumphant grown, since thus view'd all to th' full, From her Moon-world, self though invisible. We must not (Reader) here neglect, ore-run What good while past (more memorable) done By th' Duke ARPLASTUS prov'd, the fayr FLOSTEL When grown a Wanderer, short mild Farwell Sent him in writing, as we sayd; whose lines His Lordship view'd not without troublous signes, Sad, Griefressenting thoughts, though secret Qualm Which thus he turn'd more lightly off, ore-came: Since, She withdrawn, no dangerous Clashings thence, jars with th' onely Minion of his sence Belov'd COMANDRA, or his own Lust-vice; Dear above all: though more severely Wise, The Duk unriddled ith' worse sence her going, As but foul Grude 'gainst meer COMANDRA showing
Of whom still Fond as ere: nor (heightned Fate!) Wanted that Whoor spight, art, to aggravate. Well knowing the dismall cause (black, guilty Soul!) Since, spent some little while, up closely stole Those backward-stayrs, there listening for some Groan; Fine Gasping Sigh; which horrid Musick done (As she conceiv'd) she hop'd to bless her Eyes With fayrest, dainty'st Coorse beneath the Skies: She hoped, look'd, till starting wildly round, Dead little Dog found Proxy on the ground: Though soon pour'd forth that Poys'nous, Stygian broath To PLUTO Sacrifice, discreetly loth Her devillish Stratagem should thence be known; Chaf'd, beat her Brest, though wondrous joy'd she's gone. Strong thoughts, th' Officious friendly Fates would do't (Ere long) through Hunger, deep dispair to boot. Thus, three months wandred o're, the Duke ARPLAST More thoughtfull grown, devout reflections cast On's lov'd, lascivious Crime; th' ignoble stain Foul Blur thereof; conscentred lastly ith' Vein Of salving all by Marriage, counting this Honours Restorative, chief Virtue-peice: Least kinder Hints whereof what heightning Charmes Found, dearly'st Suckl'd still, between her armes Nor could he lose this matchless Gem; besides, Wanting Male-jewell, Son, the Duke confides Heaven would more succeed him in those chast Fruitions (Rich and fertile Soyl, nor past Youths prime, COMANDRA deem'd) thus th' honest Road His thoughts approve, though rough and hardly trode; Wedding gears, Cables; joyned both together Now th' are, indeed, no, Pompous business neither: 'T was Secret stoln, bate some few Houshold eyes, Since no great Glorying in th' unworthy Prize: Whight honest loves, transcendent Fortunes most Become those Gayer forms, such gaudy boast.
Thus had she mounted now that losty Tow'r, Those Star-like heights she aym'd at; happy hour, FLOSTELLA since so far remote those Walls Thus Pest infected round! though wisely fails ARDINA to inform her ought, 'twould borrow More Coyn (she deem'd) t' improve her stock of Sorrow. But (lo) our fond and eager Muse o' relong Can't from that matchless Payr, amidst the throng Of Virginsisterhood, be over-sway'd; Much time (howe're) Deceas'd, since last survay'd: ALTHUSA, proving in the Evens cool Double-retir'd at once (through thoughtfull Soul) To her own Brest, and to her Chamber too, Whilst most oth' Nymphy train abroad did woo Choice Evening-sports (some treading round their Ma, Or 'bout their Founts, some breath'd with Running plays, For Fishing, gathering Flow'rs) sate musing on Her pretty strange Life, fortunes, all alone; Sad-pleasant state, since Loves main youthfull fire Unquenched yet, check'd in her dear Desire: Oyle poured still upon the Flame, while tasting Love-sallets, sweets, preserves, still hungry, Fasting. PLDORA her Consort too, the more she's known, Beheld, still more divine-stamp'd Object shone To th' sounder Reason, beauteous more to th' Sence; Griev'd thus, till Union'd with such excellence; Her Body, through her lovely Soul, made more Attractive, strong, though Charm'd enough before: Yea, through her Windowes too, that moment view'd, The Gardens clasping Woodbines, Vines renew'd Conjugall folds resemblances; their Young Birds chaunted o're, as Loves effects they sung. Cloy'd through these solemn thoughts, conceits, to those More Sportive strait she falls, survaying goes Her Female dress, in smiles, as if sh' had sayd, And casuch Fires these Virgin-robes invade?
What, lurking here? though Masque-like toyes (alas) She-cobwebs, Mists, which nought could Sex deface, Damp lusty Manhood; nights especially, When with their sorry Spells cashir'd, layd by. Next, Cheers up, since her blifull Freedomes hour Drawn nigh, and those delayes ith' Vestall Bow'r ('T was thought) would primely Sweeten full Fruition; Recompence all with Ravishing condition. Thus, Sober, pleas'd, took down PLEDORAS Lut (At which with learned'st Masters could dispute) Then, gently kissing it (which seem'd as 'twere Ambitious with ALTHUSAS Passions there, To warble forth at once its Mistress prayses, Joyfull, complying) thus he gladsome chases Dull moody Fogs from thence, in sweetest tones But soft withall, AMPHION so charm'd Stones. Song. 1. Come thou gentle Hand and Voyce Ease my Heart, Let your art Teach ev'n Mystick griefs rejoyce; Riddles showing: Time stands bound To cure the Wound; Mean while Reason's Balm bestowing. 2. Mistress of my Joyes I am, Want them though; Having (lo) My dear Wish, am barr'd the same: Boast with pleasure That I Own The Mine alone, Yet not Grasp the Hoord and treasure.
3. Ripest, wealthy Field possess, Golden-ear'd; Yet, deter'd From due Crop, Pine neretheless: Fancy eases, Dreams afford Sweet crop and hoord; Waking though new Sorrow seizes. This, scarcely cloz'd, when strait comes in the sweet PLEDORA, wilder-look'd (chang'd Visage, meet For flying DAPHNE turn'd) Ah my ALTHUSE, Sayd she, We'r both undoe. Worst, saddest newes hough softly breath'd! Why? strait ALTHUSE reply'd, Startling; her Languag'd looks since much descry'd, Tongue more: We'r both betrayd (said she agen) Lost, ruin'd Startled more ALTHUSA when, Speak't plainly out (reply'd) leave thus tormenting: That Nymph, sayd she, that Mayd DUCENZA (fainting) What, what of her? ALTHUS A strait replyes; Comes here tomorrow early, by Sun-rise (Sayd she again) inrolled Nun of choyce ALTHUS A flushing strait) th' admitting Voyce passd (went further on) my self but now O' re-heard th' old Priestess, down by th' Founts, allow Grant all to th' Ancient Mayd, imployed by'er: How sighing cloze! which tunefull Breath, rays'd higher, PLFDORAS too, might Sweeten seem Misfortune. The Case seem'd wondrous hard, would doubts impor∣tune; For first, th' whole Mayden train obliged were To welcome strait (as one) New-comer there With Kiss salute; nor left their Virgin-cell Any, but gave to all last kind Farwell. What's more, sworn Vestall just as then (that Even) Dy'd sodainly; next Morn 'twixt ten, eleven,
Th' whole Virgin-troop were bound t' attend upon Her mournfull Corps, DULCENZA being one, All duely payr'd; PLEDORA thus, her Love ALTHUSE with joyn'd DULCENZA last would prove: Which Body being interr'd, Assembled all Those Nuns of choyce from thence ith' open Hall (Each seated to their proper time) that place Of Vestall Nun being offer'd first (in grace) To th' Senior Virgin; who if chanc'd refuse, Down lower still, till reach'd PLEDORA, ALTHUSE, DULCENZA last) (ALTHUSA next above 'er) Who thus POLINDOR soon must needs discover Thorough ALTHUSE; since Lovers Eagle-eyes See tenfold, peirce those Vapour-sprinkled Skies More then SOL'S conqu'ring beams, would open lay him: To th' Priestess and ORTHERIS both betray him. This, sadly told, ALTHUS A cheer'd her strait With best coyn'd looks, and words; Their gloomy Fate Happy in this (alleg'd) her Mayden vow Since almost out, full Year expiring now That very Night, O, but RUFIN (she cry'd) Too tardy Guardian, would not there be spy'd, Nor fetch them thence next day till th' Afternoon. What though? (reply'd ALTHUSE) since, e're the Sun Be rouz'd, awoke, for Flight their freedome given, From whose Back-door close Passage (deign'd by Heaven) Did lead to th' Gardens bolted Postern door; Whence no long Walk for them to reach TREGOR Next Burrough-town, RUFIN inform'd from thence: Th' old Priestess with her Nuns (most strange pretence Forg'd by him for their going) that mean while Feign'd Paper, left oth' Table, should begule: Nr criminous Plot, convinc'd that Vesta, she, Was now no true but false Mock-deity. But if (sigh'd th' other then) No more of those Prsaging If (ALTHUSE reply'd) the cloze
Transmit to Heaven; Earth and fates though cruell, Yet, Gods would guard howe're their dearest Jewell. Thus, firm-resolv'd, and that whole Starry night Watch'd out, Both in their cloathes, till faint Dawn-light Peep'd smiling on them; All how slumbring, close! Lull'd like Sleeps drowsie Babes! th' whole ample house Turn'd Charnell, meer Tomb! eithers Linnen-store, POLINDOR'S robes, her Iewell-box (no more) Were nimbly took, and left oth' open Board Large Paper, did this feign'd device afford, Great VESTA charg'd this present Night, By Vision, we should take wing'd flight T'her THRACIAN Temple (whispring nere Least word) so, wait her pleasure there: And what those awfull Powers command Frayl Mortalls must not dare withstand. PLEDORA, ALTHUSA. Then, stealing gently forth Back-door oth' room, All night left open wide (thus, silent dumb That's bolt appear'd) through small joyn'd Wilderness; Seem'd planted for their flight, Both did address Their Ghost-like eps to th' Gardens postern-door (There seem'd a Fount all tears, the solemn Bow'r There quiv'ring Sigh'd, Herbs, Flowers drooping round At parting) from that Door free Passage, ground To th' mention'd Plain beneath; which nicely'st touch Like softer Gales, coy silvan Nymphs, or such, Payr'd sportive Goddesses, when, left their Skies, O're th' mossie, Silken Lawns do wantonize: Whilst splendid PHOEBES cheek, but lately shining, Seem'd now Cloud vayl'd as 'twere, in love combining To shelter wandring Virtue, as it flyes: O may not th' own fayr Rayes, FLOSTELLAS Eyes, May not their own most Violet-like Scent Those Feet betray. Thus, pass'd the Plain, they bent
Their steps to th' green Roads, which, trod lightly through Both joyfull bad to th' Mayden Grove Adien, So tow'rds TREGOR, great Town four miles off lying, Far distant from the Vale, whence quick Pos flying, Should fully inform RUFIN, their Life-guard friend, Whose able Freeness would supply to th' end With generous Maint'nance, sav'd her Iewels so; And make him's Heir. Thus, whilst they panting go (T' whom also their first worthyer Names we now, POLINDOR and FLOSTELLA, shall allow) Much gentler-pac'd, advanced further on; Loud Voyce amaz'd them both, FLOSTELLA soon Startling through fear, least horrid stop, Surprize; Th' Heart quak'd: POLINDOR roul'd fierce, gazing eyes: Till spy'd (by chance) thick leavy Fence, between, Both pausing harken'd there, when strait agen It loudly spake; to which did answering prove Shrill Eccho, thus: FLORIS and the ECCHO, —FLO.

Whom, scarcely ceasing, Our Pilgrim-lovers left to's fonder play With's ayr-born Mistress, thus, resum'd their way, (Much pitty'd though) till now, Three Miles oth' four Travayl'd, dispatch'd, both chanc'd to progress o're Fine Velvet-plain with flowry crop Beged; Thorough whose midst small Chrystall River seem'd To sport it self about, in wanton Mazes: Trees, Natures Em'rald-bowrs, their verdant graces Joyn'd from both sides the bank, Sun-fans (as 'twere) To th' Pearl-cheek'd dancing Nymph; or seemed there To stand at gaze, like her intranced Lovers. Close by these Palms and plumed Myrtle-covers Their Iourney prov'd some while, chief walks delight; When (lo) the thundring Noyse did oth affright Of Hrses hoofs, with six tall armed Men (Down went their Veyles in hast) heard balling then Loud throats, to boot: Those, those are they, they sayd, Take, nimbly seize 'em. O, we'r both betrayd (Cry'd th' Aspine-trembling Lady) lost, undone: Sweet'st-utter'd words, though breath'd with mournfull tone, Nigh swoonding. He's become Tempestuous too, Soul-tortur'd, agoniz'd, her single Wo Though deeply'st Stab'd enrag'd his manly Brest (Through self-enlightning uilt both charg'd, confest Prime-dismall Author on't) endur'd such Passion As felt the Load of all Mankinds vexation,
Th' whole Globe of grief: wants usefull Armes, beside Wherewith he might or there have bravely Dy'd, Or cut her Passage through them; no escape (Least glimps) unless by wily force and Rape He could disarm some one, so gain'd a Sword: Though all the rest with murthering Pistolls stor'd: Yet seem'd this dangerous Project fixt upon, Freedome, or Death; these words sigh'd forth alone, Dear, hope still. Gallop'd up the Rout, they cry'd, Yeild, or th' art dead; when from 's beloved side She's rudely seiz'd, Five tumbling strait on him Like pond' rous falling Tow'rs, as thus would seem By th' Press to execute, ere sentenc'd so: Their Leaders words, Here's that Male She, the Shrow, Fine femall Youth▪ All, Bind him, bind him (crying) Quick, hast; worst doom it was, seem'd next to Dying: Since being once Bound, his main Plot's frivolous. Sore galled Heart, sad-glancing Eyes, since thus Snatch'd from his Chief (how dearly'st-earned) Treasure▪ Neer-grasp'd Delights; one Moments plundring seizure Rob'd all, like Gem stor'd Indian Vessell, split Ith' blisfull Harbours mouth; or, neerer yet, Stronger portrait, like one from Heaven hurl'd To th' Hells Abiss. Unvayled both to th' world, Oth' cooz'ning Fates! This is not He (they cry'd) Nor is this She; as Bugbears, charms espy'd: Glad sounds to th' drooping , joyntly thus Wonder-reviv'd; though (Mayd-like timorous) Shrewd Qualm stil seiz'd the dear FLOSTEELA'S brest, Whilst those continu'd on their rambling Quest. The ground was thus; ere Dawn peep'd on the Globe, Wild, sharking, handsome Youth, through womans Robe Nights shades befriended round, had stoln a Girl From her strickt Guardian (most wealthy Pearl) Coming acquaintance-like 'bout noon to Chat, As School-fellow, great Wedding there till late,
When slunk forth (busy'd, dancing all) for flight: Though follow'd soon that spruce Hermophrodite Stout Horsemen, strongly informd they passd these Downs; Both wearing too same colour'd Skarfs, and Gowns, Like-statur'd Both; whence all this coyl descending: FLOSTELS close Panting-fit not eas'ly ending. As for DULCNZA though, prime cause that hour Of all, she came not to the Vestall Bow'r; Though had (indeed) with older Mayd combin'd To sally forth that Night, whilst PHOEBE shin'd Her Virgin-guardian; so reach the Grove 'Bout break of day: since, toyl'd through Tyrant-love, As worst of Slaveries her heart began To loath it, and the World; 'gainst thoughts of Man That closer Bow'r. Nuns chast converse, would give Best charms (she deem'd) prove sweet'st Restorative: Tost with Loves blustring Storms, her Bark-like brest Sought there for Anchorage, chief harbour of rest: Portion by th' Uncle left, which would maintain Her Nun of choyce, til sworn oth' Vestall train. Whose Stratagem both Parents dear descrying, They stop'd her course, with Friends best means applying Mild gentlest Salves, to cure those thoughts anew; MENANDER whilst for Love did strongly sue; Much further'd by her Friends, thereby to tame Both this last Mod, and th' old unhappy Flame. As close SIRENUS su'd, MARPESAS Lover. Thus, much rejoyc'd this blacker Clouds blown over (Though caus'd, as were those Vestall frights of late, Through vain fear, Lovers hanting Ghost, sad fate) On walk'd th' enlivened Payr to th' further side, Large spreading Wood, where smaller Path espy'd. When (lo) the Lady faintish grown through late Long watching, journey, frights, cool Liquor's bait Much wish'd, desir'd, they thought awhile to tread That Path, which would perhaps more friendly lead
To some refreshing Cell or Lodge; much lower (Enticed on) they found, unlatch'd a Door: Whence pass'd large squared Plot, strong lofty-fenc'd▪ Part ope, part shaded ground, 'twas place dispenc'd Much rarity for th' woods; Art, Nature where So link'd combin'd, that well drest Rudeness there Both might present to th' eye; or seem t' express Pert Loneness, cheerfull, sprightly Solemness: As that its chief Grace meant, delight, the easier To poize light Fancy grave, yeild jocund Pleasure Sober allay; transform'd to Solid, wise Quick Sanguin-temper, whilst dull Phlegm dries. Th' whole plot some Spirit Philosophick show'd, Or as 'twould sute that working Soul; the Mode Such briefly, as if, with Princes daintier way Cloy'd, tyr'd, slunk'd Art had hither stole to Play. Anon, much more: cross'd smaller Green, ith' Nook Fine, pritty, larger Cell their fancy took; Which being approach'd, 'twas formed all, cut out Oth' main entire Rock, thunder proof, as stout Th' Iron Doors appear'd; the Walls with Vines ore-clad, Resembling civill Wildness, pensive, sad, Dampt Pleasantness; as if the Owner there Had thought to steal some Comfort, joy (as 'twere) From th' World and his own spightfull Grief, would so Play th' walking Ghost (ELIZIUM-plains below Map'd in this Plot) till, th' Actour's part layd by, Turn reall true Ghost, fold his armes and Dye. Entring, they met with None, yet all was Neat; Furnish'd though Plain, as seem'd t' acknowledge yet Some Master; Table, Stool, with Chayr and Bed, Trunk, Linnen-chest, Time's Hower-glass, Death's head: Wall bench'd, where Silver Chain belt, Faulchion hung; Coorse wooden Plate, uncobweb'd Books a throng: Large Cubbord too, where such Cheese, Butter, store O cold Bak'd meats, as fortnight full (or more)
Would serve their Host, Weeks plenteous food for Two, New-lay'd in (constant Party brought it so Each Fornight stil, from th' neibouring Town, DERVISE) Close Corner lastly cabin'd Roots discries: Drink too, though pleas'd the Owner Natures stray Fount-celler oft. Upon the Table lay Broad Paper, being entitled thus; The Poor HERMONUS Will: which thus POLIND read ore. What e're here enter'st, know I stood Once ASTORIN, of noblest blood High'st fortunes too; but Uncle base (Whose Name would fright down Daylight, rayse Storms, Devils) BRUNDESCAR, learn'd in all Court-mischiefs, crimes, my Fathers fall Caus'd through forg'd Treason (rare Brothers part! Worth Hells record) thus, through damn'd art Beg'd all's Lands, got him banish'd far: Though soon chang'd life with's Country-ayre, Small stock bequeathed me: though prim'd The Cross, my Beggers curse sublim'd This cloze; That loss much fairer Prize Snatch'd from me, a Lady, in whose eyes Blaz'd Beauties Noon; t'whom th' Indies poor, Th' whole world mere Atome seem'd, no more. Thus then, some Iewels took, I stray'd Earths Maze as Pilgrim (Wind's comrade, Sun's fellow-travailler) that Round, T' outrun my dogging Griefs, or hound A Grave forth: Heats, Frosts vex'd by turn: Till this Globe-pageant, lo, grand Urn Of all flesh view'd, with weary soles (Like fortunes tost Ball 'tween the Poles) My own Shore I trod; now grown Frost-bearded: Where spying this Nook of rest, thus guarded Frm the Worlds noyse, I bought it mine; Was call'd HARMONUS still; SOL'S sine
Here many a Sommers progress cher'd. My Body, found, see kindly interr'd In its last bed, whose Tomb to th' Cave Close joyns; with this short Epitaph: Who three Worlds ranged hath, here lies; Love's, Sorrow's, That of Vanities. And in return slip down that board Oth' wall, there's twenty pound (Gold-hoord) Take it, and th' whole Freehold dispose As thine; but keep Conditions; close The poor HARMONUS in his Tomb, As hop'st to tread Elizeum. This read, Both wonder'd more, since could discry No Creature yet; till in the Root-plot by (Walk'd forth) did handsome Tomb (yet open) view, Lodg'd in the side oth' Cave; what stranger too, One lying in't, all-cloath'd, as newly Dead: Most reverend Lump of Age, whose hoary Head, Beard snowy Alps appear'd, stiff, frozen-limb'd; Being that HARMONUS Corps, the which (it seem'd) (As Both by Covenant were strongly ty'd) Death softly whisp'ring, had layn down and Dy'd. Which view'd, our Noblest Couple, after some Kind Tears, meet pious duties clos'd the Tomb Of their old Father strait; reciv'd as given This pritty small Love-grange a Boon from Heaven, Sweet'st sheltring Fort; although Light-horse were bound To Scour these Parts, that Vestall coast oft round Calm as the quiet Sphears, so that a Girl Might wander safe, unrifled, bearing Pearl: So Close reserv'd besides, no Shepheard-swains Hanted this Coast, nor trod the Neighbouring Plains, How various (lo) those Mystick folds of Fate! Blest happy love succeeds Vnfortunate. Wood-bordring Woman too there was, did look To th' Cell sometimes, dead Palsey whom then strook.
Thus, entring Cell again, ALTHUSA strait Vanish'd for Sex to ayre, full manly State POLINDOR reassumes (ith' open Chest Found comely Robe, which long since did invest Young, generous ASTORIN) whilst smil'd FLOSTEL; Whose Mans robes, Faulchion, that Chain-belt so well Bedeck'd his Person round, there seem'd to move In one (she thought) both God of War and Love. Next, Cordiall waters drunk, took good Repast Oth' Hermits pleasing food, which when did wast RUFIN would all supply; perhaps procur'd No Place by him as yet, thing unassur'd (Nor would he Wonder more, but deem some Fright Caus'd this Concealment, as their former flight) Mean while on Heaven themselves, their faith they roul. This Breakfast done, POLINDORS craving Soul Tongue both (since tost as yet ith' Lover's Ocean) Were 'bout to ask new Sweets; though damp'd that Mo∣tion The faint, ore-drooping Ladies Appetite To rest (Himself but drowsie too, scarce right) Her Watch, sore frights, and journey thought in reason Bad Friends to Loves more advantageous season: Thus, th' Iron-door being fast, securely clos'd, Both down upon that Hermits Bed repos'd Joynt sleeping Partners thus, their armes intwin'd; More wealth then in SOL'S circuit there confin'd. Come gentlest God of sleep, most fayr behold Of all thy drowsie Empire, bind, infold Their yeilding Sences (silken Cordialls are Those pleasing Bands) come, Kiss this lovely'st Payr To downy Quiet, Bathing first their Eyes In slumbers Essence, Soul whilst waking lies; Through Dreams in part those Ioyes to come portraying: No Noyse cause Rapes upon their Rest, dismaying. Thus, each (bright living Coorse) payd Natures due; Thus slept they, glorious whilst they slept (to view)
Sweet'st Innocences Twofold Picture there: POLINDOR (cloy'd) if chanc'd to waken ere, Her Eye lids clos'd, would Wink again, as he Woo'd, courted Sleep, to bear her company; Not stealing softest Kiss, least, Guilty so (Love-crime howere) of Sin, disturbance show. Thus slumber'd they, till flown through Signs of heaven Many wing'd posting Hours, to six ith' even When both Awoke. The joy'd POLINDOR now Most blith and fresh (transported through that Vow Cloud-like blown o're) with dear Imbracings, kisses, Begun to claim (indeed) Conjugall blisses: To which again, how sweetly'st blushing, she (Smiles mixt) reply'd; My Lord, I now am free ('Tis true) from shackling Vowes confess'd beside By Marriage Yours; thus, shall not least provide Coy shifts, gainsay your Pleasure; yet my Suit Would move Once more (part faintish still to boot) That you would Grant me but three Hours alone, Till shdy Night, this Bed we slumber'd on, Might shroud my Bashfulness: my dearest Lord, Shall I obtain this? smil'd, each sugred word. Which answer'd then POLIND; Thus still you do Torment a Lover, Sweet: If't should be so, My Lord (sayd she again) I've done; no more▪ But dearest, then sayd he (withall forbore Scarce smiles) shall not that Grant be censur'd, thought Dull coldness in my Blood? or styled ought Want of Affection in me? Loathsome, either: O no, my Lord (she cry'd) I vow, thought neither, But rather deem'd your Love, through wish'd complying With my Girls humour thus: To which replying Nought more, but sigh, strait leapt he from the Bed, As from that Gorgon, snake, Temptation fled (Though much convinc'd indeed by Fancies pow'r, Her speciall Mood, kind daintier Garb that hour
In Bed, would give Compleatest satisfaction) When she rose too: Thus, Rouz'd and fresh for action, Both Walk'd forth, pleas'd with their new Prospect, ayre; Where we must leave awhile this Hermit-payr. Now glance we back upon the Vestall Bow'r, And what there pass'd: Next morn, that solemn Hour For th' Vestall Nun dispatch'd, th' Interment-rites (Next business being for Choyce) whilst to all Sights (Though call'd) ALTHUSA and PLEDORA lost; Some nmbler Nymphs by th' way were hurry'd post To th' Chamber-door; where calmest Silence found, Nought Whisperings, they joyntly progress'd round To their Back-door; wide Yauning that did show Two chast Birds fled, th' Ayre left their Tenant, lo. All wonder'd; when the old Priestess comes, espies Oth' boord that Paper, reads with all four eyes▪ (Those glistring glaz'd Recruits) oft roul'd at heaven; Illfac'd devotion 'twas, whilst joyntly given No small heed, reverence by th' younger Crew, Flock'd round about her then, as though there blew Some sacred Whirlwind; just like Charmed things She th' old Inchantress prov'd. Grief, sorrow stings Most Mayden brests (alas) yea so far were Some junior Nuns of choyce, grand Zelots there (Unsworn to th' Place yet) mov'd therewith, transported, That, what through jealous thoughts their Goddess sorted More Honors, favours to that THRACIAN Bow'r (In part withdrawn from hence) so Dear that hour PLEDORA also esteem'd, ALTHUSA too; Those Girls would needs like Lady-errants go For th' THRACIAN realm: Till loud th' old Priestess cry'd (Joyn'd with more setled Nuns) That this imply'd (Well-weigh'd) but meer their own fantastick Dream, No heav'n-born Vision: Next, informed them, How Fond these thoughts, since VESTAS Deity Fill'd all her Bow'rs alike; nor could they spy,
For pleasures choyce Map, such transcendent Piece, Like Virgin-mansion though they travayl'd Greece: Whose Foundress with the lasting glory dy'd Of Queen and Mayd; now doubtless Stellify'd. So, progress'd ore the whole; which, since so much Concerns FLOSTELLAS Blood, descent, we'l touch. This Princess, Queen, great heir to th' CIPRIAN Crown Times past was born, whose Scepter with renown Oft Femalls sway'd, enjoy'd; PERSANDRA nam'd: One Sister more there was, by nature claim'd Her part ith' royall Blood, royall record, BERCINTHE this: But vile usurping Lord Oth' Blood, call'd PHORBAN, Stain to th' Kingly race (Though huge in Factions pow'r and Wealth did blaze) Reach'd at the Throne; &, having slain through Treason Their gallant'st Father first (choice fittest season) PERSANDRA then 'bout year and quarter old, Soon grasp'd the Crown; that Circle of thorny Gold, Royall Head-guive: though next in bloody chase Her Life appeard, this Blossome nip'd (alas) By frosty Death, must raise advance his Spring. Which Mischief justly fear'd (since Brooding thing Vile Treason found, one Crime but spawns another) By th' wretch'd and most indulgent Queen, her Mother, CLARVESIA call'd; she suddenly convays This elder Femall Comfort of her dayes, Chief princely CYPRIAN branch from Tyrants Sword (Th' half dearest Remnant of her murther'd Lord) Nurse privie too't, to most transcendent Peer, Styl'd good LORELE. What bowels yernings there, Tears, mixed Sighes! what clasping folds and Kisses! How call'd she back again her parting Blisses, Wept sobrest new Farwells! till, at the last, Cry'd, Take't away; though follow'd then in hast To th' Threshold, Door, how Kiss'd, imbrac'd it there! Forth then Nurse slily stole, as Voyage 'twere!
For th' ayre that Evening, with her Infant-gem To woody Plain adjoyn'd, where stayd for them Both Coach and six tall Horses from LORELE; Which comely'st Matron bare, known Party well To him (since prov'd his Keepers Wife indeed) Who, gently cheering it, with trusty speed Receiv'd that Royall charge, by joynt accord: Informed though, 'twas Orphan, kin to th' Lord: So, towards strait her shady Lodge she flyes Far off remote; where full Commands, supplies Were giv'n her by LORELE, for choycest trayning, Though now new-stampd, CHLORINDAS Name retai∣ning. Nurse back to th' Castle agen (as was desir'd) Unseen, secure, through Gloomy walks retir'd; Where, fitly joyn'd her Fellow nurse, that Night Small mournfull Coffin (lo) by Torches light Was carry'd forth, as though the Babe had dy'd Of some strange Pest, by th' royall Mothers side: The Queen much heightning all through grief sick-browd, Lock'd up upon't; thus, speedy'st Grave allow'd: Whose faithfull'st Nurse soon after (plot unknown) To th' mention'd Lodge▪ and little Lady's gone: Next Morn, her Infant-sister, last eye-sore To th' wakefull Tyrant, was pack'd down to Shore, With second Storm of dismall Sighes and Tears, Woes second part; like Mothers yernings, fears, Close foldings, kisses, secret heart-bemoanings, Since thus giv'n up to th' Wind & Wave; what groanings, Vowes, prayers made! that sweetest Innocence Might (charm'd Sea-tyrants too) escape from thence. Thus, down the Havens stream with tendrest Nurse She's Lanched forth, as though some shorter course (For ayering, health) to country Grange below; Where GRAECIAN Merchant, being order'd so By th' Lord LORELE his friend, took both aboard For ARCADY; where Brother to that Lord
(Lines sent) as then become chief Favourite, Her faithfull Guardian prov'd, she his Delight: Call'd CHLORIFLEUR: which Infant not returning, 'Twas noys'd, conceiv'd, some Pirat-theeves (that morning Did scour in truth those Watry Roads) had drown'd. As for this Last, from rich ARCADIN bound Knd Sayles and winds glad Newes transported oft To th' Lord LORELE; yea, sweet'st Epistles brought (So soon as CHLORIFLEURS small daintyer hand Could Limb but letters forth, small Pen command) Wrapt up in his; her Mothers high'st degree But Baroness, inform'd, call'd MELIDE: Nor knew that Merchant more (least blab'd, descry'd) But that some noble Orphan 'twas, Ally'd. As for CHLORINDA though, Fates, milder grown, Gave her oft private Vws, in clouds unknown (Stoln joyes delightfull too, most dear to thought) Since visiting by fits that Lady oft Of good LORELE as friend (SICAMBE nam'd) Whole Month sometimes (whose Councel not disclaim'd) They two would frequently to th' Park repair Mile's distance off, as though for th' Evening ayre (Choice gallant Prospect 'twas beside) well Coach'd; Which having pranced round, thir Lodge approach'd, They'd enter still for easefull Bait, the Queen Her small CHLORINDA thus (brought alwaies in By th' Nurse, as for SICAMBES onely view) Fondlily'st enjoy'd. First glance on it 'tis true, Just cross the Court she spy'd it Didling go, Whence inmost bowels seem'd to roul; but O, The Mothers tendrest Garb and meltings ore Her harmless Babe (Nurse standing by, no more) What Joy-grief-medley there! what tears and smiles! Show'r, mixed Sunshine! how embrac'd the whiles, Hug'd, kissd it oft! when clasping her agen The gentle Babe, now sober-temper'd, then
Smiling as much, till Wept (poor heart) at last For solemn Company; full sorrows blast When Sighed forth the dear ore-charged Mother: What Bablings (last) begun from t'one to th' other, 'Twas pritty rare Sight, caused thence to rise Sad pleasure ith' Beholders dewed eyes. She Wept, yet weeping though she blesses Heaven, Since lives and safties both at once were given To her poor Orphan-brood; what's more, so Kind, That T'one of them's ith' Armes just then intwin'd. The Girl as elder grew, discerning more, Reverse the Queen her cautious Passions wore, Turn'd inward; strove by secret art to smoother; Though when must play the fondly indulgent Mother, Such Buddings seen of Wit, and choice perfection, As well as Beauty, growth, then, sad reflection On th' murther'd Father, injur'd Childs estate, She'd whisper gentle Sighes; or, turning strait, Weep forth kind hasty Show'r (as 'twere) by stealth, Oft in some corner dropt the Liquid wealth, Those molten Pearls: then, having cleer'd the Skie, Toy'd, Chatting-game renew'd, till th' busie eye Of sweet CHORINDA mark'd at length, perceiv'd: Who ask'd her Nurse (though whimperingly griev'd) What was the Cause that Lady wept for so. Nurse told; Her murther'd Lord inforc'd that Wo; Two little Daughters also lately dead, Th' one much resembling her, which likewise bred Strange Love, affection to her. Sayd the Child; I know not, but methinks (then sweetly smil'd) I love her (Nurse) far more then she loves me, Nor can I rest least satfy'd, till she New hugs me, till she kisses me anew; Fain would I dwell with her. The good DORU, Y' are not yet old nor big enough, replies. Ah, sayd the Child again with beaming eyes,
But I could talk with her, and find her Play Howere, I hope: Thus pass'd that part oth' day. Though, growing bigger yet, th' enlarged Queen Her self would say, whilst kiss'd embrac'd between, Your Mother (pritty one) intruth was crown'd Dear to me, Sister-like, th' especiall ground You share this kinder Love; although you do Revive to th' thoughts my bury'd Daughter too Most like the First (twain once this Womb producing) Thus, Love with Sorrow both at once infusing. To which reply'd that royall Bud (anon) With pleasing'st grace; Would heaven that she alone (Madam) survived yet, that I might prove Her humble Handmayd. Showring tears of love In smiles, No sweet (reply'd CLARVESIA then) Youl'd Mayd of honour prove perhaps to th' Queen. 'Bout eight years old, to th' Lord's own house transplan∣ted (As neer of Blood) she was, which Court-like vanted, Since made this Princely'st Iewels Cabinet; Now seem'd CLARVESIAS Joy almost compleat. Thus, growing on, at full Ten years (no more) Choice Aprils early Blooms her Cheeks they wore: Till, mounted up to th' gallant pitch, Fifteen, Grown Woman-ripe as then, true Princess, Queen Blaz'd in her sunny eye, Breath'd from her brest, Both Coyn'd as 'twere for empire; Beauties crest Her brow presents, with Honours glorious Throne: When strait her Mystick Birth's discover'd, shown In private room, LORELE, CLARVESIA by (Fit'st time) But O the various Extasie, Bosome-intrancements, folds that very hour! Smiles, kisses, tears! Joy shew'd its soveraign pow'r In th' One, at first; Joy, wonder in the Other; Grief shortly both in Daughter though and Moter Prov'd equall rule, through th' envious wrongs of Fate, The Virtue, worthy'st Passion shewn in that
Prime Scean of nature (Reader) fancy may, Much nimbler then my Pen, to th' full Portray. And now the good LORELE begun to groan, Till saw PERSANDRA deck her Fathers Throne; His Soul grown Pregnant, big (as 'twere) did prove With loyall thoughts of equity and love Tow'rd so bright Innocence: as meetly just, To th' Queen erelong, some greater Peers of trust Unclasp'd his inmost Brest (took solemn Oath) Then, private Views of her, conversings both Afforded them; so Prince-like those esteem'd, All Wept, they wept; at once transported seem'd Their eyes and eares, Ingaged too their Hearts. Wise Agents felt (as 'twere) by secret arts The People pulse (propound, What if alive Their Princess, Queen? found quick and strong, they drive Most boldly and undaunted on, took field; Next following Year that barbrous Tyrant kill'd In Battail, sunk through ease and weakning pleasure: Won's proud Metropolis, chief hoord of treasure, Three parts oth' Kingdomes four, whilst still the rest (Some Haven-towns) his sturdy Heir possest. Thus raign'd PERSANDRA as the Cyprian Sun, Till PHOEBUS too his yearly course had run; What time the worthy'st Queen CLARUESIA dies, Gave up her Soul to heaven, whose drousie eyes (Their lids fair Curtains to this worldly Light) Both Daughters clos'd in death; her Young'st delight Late come from ARCADY, where gallant Lord Espoused had: she, back return'd aboard (Of whom more shall be sayd anon) Behold, CLARUESIA being set, dark Clouds unfold. That Tyrant's haughty Heir, most Lion-stout As suttle, boldly stak'd at one last bout His utmost All; took field, pitch'd Battail tries; Through churlish Fates, or humane treacheries
Shatter'd ere long, disjoynted all her Pow'r: PERSANDRA flying to Port-town, that hour: Whence with a monstrous Mass of treasure, there Lay'd up 'gainst thundring Storm, of late (the Peer LORELE her Guardian) trusts to foaming Seas, Since Land unkindest prov'd; through gentlest these Soon reach'd th' Arcadian shelter, thither came: Purchas'd this goodly Place, this Grove of fame, Tall Temple (lastly) Mansion-bow'r admir'd Gave up to VESTAS honour, use; retir'd, Weary of earths soon-fading Tinsell glory, As VESTAL Nun she clos'd her Royall Story. Here Sister, here train'd up, did Morn-like rise Th' unequall'd Joy and wonder of all eyes, Monopolizer of all Manly hearts As womans beauty, Courtier turn'd (choyce parts) Crown'd there She-miracle, was Sty'd alone Lovely, excelling: whether being gone, Plac'd 'bout the Queen, she took a mighty Lord Love's Pris'ner, joyned both by chast ccord; From whence ARPLASTUS and FLOSTELLA sprung: And thus true Royall heir the Ladies sung, As from BERCINTHE to that CYPRIAN Crown. Thus to PERSANDRA (her Aunt far off) renown To th' femall Sex had rays'd as 'twere this Place (In part) through gentlest Providentiall grace For her exposed Neice, as shelter, duty To lost forsaken Virtue, wandring Beauty.
POLINDOR, AND FLOSTELLA. The THIRD BOOK. THe Reader now does seem (methinks) t' accuse And charge with heavy Guilt my bashfull Muse; Since his, with poor POLINDORS Longing fit Less Pitty'd by me, unrelieved yet: Th' Hour's neer at hand, as though betimes befriended Nights shades the Bridesgroom's wish; whose Supper en∣ded▪ Both walking forth for second bout, awhile; POLINDOR strait with pleasing Task and smile, Undrest those Flowry banks (which seem'd grown proud Their fragrant Tresses th' honour were allow'd To serve flow'rs beauteous Queen) th' unspoyled place Rich-stor'd with them: Whence, with triumphant grace, He guarded in th' All-tempting Bride, at dore Kiss-welcome given her. Then's ransack'd ore That Linnen-chest, where dainty'st Persian sheets, With whom for silken braveness sprucely fits Green Sattin Quilt, by th' Hermit brought from IND; Their Bridall Bed's dispatch'd, the joy'd POLIND Chief Agent there, still truly'st styl'd Brides-groom, Next, strow'd with aunseys round th' adorned Room, Pinks, Violets; Rose-deck'd the lovely Bed; Last, nimble Brides-mayd turn'd (ith Bower well-bred)
In part undress'd her, brisk t' uncobweb so That choycest cased Pearl: disclouded (lo) Like Shot Star strait into her Bed she glides: Then he, as though some Harness gaul'd his sides, Stiff, buly Male, strait vanish'd forth his cloaths, Which like to Tinder, Vapours, lightly blowes Off from him; seiz'd his gallant Egle's prey, That divine Ielly, sweet'st AMBROSIA: Lock'd in her armes like Earthly Sun and Moon, Or rather style them Male and Female Sun: Whose Beauties blest his Optick sence (through dear Officious Twilight) partly glim'ring there Much like the Morn, with sweet and sparkling Graces; So twinckle Diamons in gloomy places; Transporting Fancy more through th' active Eye, Touch, both at once, whence doubled extasie Both now prepar'd to practise, reall fashion (What late but Promis'd, vow'd) Self-resignation; Their true love coupling Souls conjoyned too As well as Bodies modellizing so In one Compound, all humane excellence. POLINDOR'S ready now to reap from thence, For all Loves Toyls, the blisfull Harvest treasure, Yea, rp in One bound up all Bridall Pleasure Sweet'st ere enjoy'd, summ'd up in her Alone: Where leave them to those Mystick joyes, unknown; Too High for any else to know, or dare To comprehend, unless th' Immortall Payr Loves Goddess, VENUS, with her amorous Son, Which mov'd these Fires; to those be th' honour done: None else Presume to reach their Height, least be Confounded through Dispayr'd felicity. Next, leave them Both for slumbring, soft Reposes, Till th' early Morn her pleasing smiles discloses; Whose Dreams may those advance, yet heighten more, Seem Visions of past Sweets, enjoy'd before.
And now, AURORA her blushing Cheek reveals Through th' Chrystall-arched Porch, like our FLOSTELS Saluting Handmayd, strow'd the Morning Skie With Roses, Violets (which seem'd to the eye Grand Bridall Roof) as to her speciall Honour; Shades fume like fled, that Sun might gaze upon'er, Doing last homage, beg reflection from Her Royall beams; when waken'd the Brides-groom: And view'd his Bride (still lovely'st) sleeping there Couch'd like the Day, all beauty thus (as 'twere) Interr'd in slumbers; gentlest spicy Gale Whilst breathed forth, came Whispring from the Vale Of Temple (as 'twere) her Paradisian Brest. Then slunk he down for tedious hour's feign'd rest; She's sleeping still: when, stoln soft ayery Kisse (How dainty, nice) with cast-up eyes for this To Heav'n skulk'd down for second Winking fit. Then, softly rouz'd, seal'd gentler Kiss, seal'd yet Kind second, Eagrer third; Sleep Larum Brooks No more, sh' Awoke; drest with such new-coyn'd Looks Of pritty'st, bashfull Wonder just then seeming (Strange-sweet withall) as part transform'd, or dream∣ing: Then vayl'd within his Conscious Bosome strait Smiles, blushes both, found best protection, that: Rare-scean! whilst smil'd th' ore-joy'd POLIND, grown Proud, Whole Natures Treasury at once to shrowd. Wood-chanters, wishing Bridall Ioy (as 'twere) Chirp'd forth their shril Goodmorrowes, pearched there Quite round the Bow'r; whilst Satyrs nimbly danc'd. Th'are up Both now, and ready both; advanc'd VENUS ADONIS-like (since walking leasure) Close-arm'd, intwin'd, to take their Morning pleasure. And here, by parcell-fits, we shall portray Limb forth the place; That mention'd Ground, which lay Before the Cell, was formed large Long-square; th' midst like formed Pond there stood, most fair,
Glass-cheek'd, as if well pleased grown (to th' eye) Since no Rough-manner'd Wind could enter nigh To hoyse and vex her Stream. Here often would POLINDOR Angling sit, ore-reach'd, controul'd With fair false bait (grand cheating-game oth' World) Th' ore hasty, credulous Fish, who greedy hurl'd Takes himself Pris'ner there: the unkind deceit LOSTELLA smiled at, Such stranger Feat (Sayes) caught her Heart; whilst on the embroyder'd Bank Sits gathering Flow'rs, whose ayery moved Rank Seem'd Bowing crave her hand, Pant sweetly (as 'twere) Till from th' coorse under-soyl transplanted were T' her Brests fair Eden. These she smiling showes, And draws oft by the lov'd POLINDOR'S Nose, T' afford him fragrant part, would to and fro Play th' Wanton with his Smell; who does bestow Kind Kiss, for thanks, upon the hand did wave them, Pronouncing, 'Twas her sweetest Touch that gave them Those choyce perfumed Breaths, pow'r 'bove their own: When she would Box his faulty Cheeks anon, And say, He mock'd her. Throws in tossing sport Fish at him, pearly scal'd, which could not hurt Because she darted them; though now and then, Through wilfull purpos'd Error, seiz'd agen Their former moyst Abodes, her pitty freeing That poor inthralled Wretch: the which he seeing, Strait pritty Anger feigns, when Careless she (Cross) throws in more; then would POLINDOR be Reveng'd upon her Lips, and those must do For th' Hands wish'd penance oft. Next th' Angle (lo) Was reach'd presented to'er, when harmless she Seem'd loath to Learn th' unpleasing Treachery: Yet practis'd she, at each unskilfull miss The Forfait was confirm'd a Treble Kiss; Who now, more ignorant, still missed more, As meant to make such kind Love-forfeits store:
Indeed, how could the Lady chuse? for why, Th' enamour'd Fish (most part) still gazing lye On the fair Angler, toyish grown, forget To bite the simple Worm, their Pearl-eyes set On dainty'st Lips: what wonder, these Love-shaken? The Master-angler (long before) was taken. Round this long-squared Pond fair Bank was rays'd, Like low green Tarras, sides thereof being prays'd Through well-set shady Trees, yet order'd so, As that each Third did beauteous Fruit-tree grow; The which to th' rest like Gem enamell'd show'd: Th'whole Clump might well resemble an Orchard-wood; 'Twas various, Sweet, whose toothsome fruits not wanted Tempting beholders eyes and tast, like painted Gay Crtizans; how plump! though Virgin-brows Seemed yet forc'd to wear, on th' loaden boughs Kiss'd but by PHOEBUS Beams (none hither swarving) It look'd like Natures Closet of preserving: Unless those wandring Fayries now and then, Borrow'd some Dish, to serve their dapper Queen Her Big-grown longing, Cherry or so; great Pear, Plump Apricock would furnish th' whole Court chear (Those nicest Elvish stomacks) oft 'twas found, Where their small Feet had danc'd some Antick Round. Lo, here's our blisfull-Couples chosen Walk, Where they oft progrest round intwin'd, would talk Of their first frosty Moods, ore-coy disdain (Though severall causes heighten'd much the Vein) LOVE'S pardon ask'd; devouly'st Sacrifize How many Ambrosiack Kisses 'fore his eyes! Those Love's small Offerings! would freely then Pluck dangling Fruits, then walk'd, and then agen luck'd more; when (sportive) out of wanton play, Th'heart-plundring Amorist would steal away Some Cherry from her Cherry-mouth, does so Cozen her foder Tast; then would make show
To offer one more choyce, but then again Deludes her whitest Hand reach'd forth in vain; Thus, mocks his heav'nly Fayr; who, to requite, When he would (sober) give, in pritty spight Would (Sullen) none; When he must make her Eat, So, kindly gratify'd that Tast which yet Had so Abus'd. Both cloy'd, the Youth would seek (Compar'd) to shame the Cherry by her cheek; And next, those purely'st blushing Corans hold Nigh to'er, Smiled when, th' whole Bunch controld By her fresh Lip: last flouting business, jests Upon the silken Peach, felt with her Brests Not soft, not sleek at all: here boasting shows Heav'n-plant, or Tree of Paradice to those. On either side this Bank, green velvet Flat, Whose midst bore Thickets smaller maze; 'twixt that And th' Bank Full thorough-view▪ broad space design'd (Four quarters thus) though link'd to th' Fence behind: Form just Half-Ovall fram'd; ith' further part Lodg'd Silvan rocky Fount, where Nature, Art Conjoyn'd, both Founders seem'd, but wild, ore-grown Small carved Wood-nymphs nak'd (though) cleerly shone By th' Streams beneath, with wind-dishevell'd Hayr: On th' top skulk'd leacherous Satyrs seem'd to stare, Acteon like, their horns and hoofs descry'd; Though no Coy-brow'd Diana there espy'd. Off fom their open Flat, too wanton rayes Whilst Sol on fair FLOSTELLA darts, displayes, T' avoid his hot unpleasing Courtship, hither She'd fly for Leavy skreen; where both together, Close-couch'd by th' Mossie Rock, took pleasure there To see their Fount weep forth it self (as 'twere) With kind of bubling moans: Such for thy sake Was I once (sayd the Lord POLIND) did make Those teary Plaints. Th'heav'n-lov'd FLOSTELLA when Reply'd; Wat pitty sh' had not Treasur'd then
Those drops for Neck-pearl, wrist! When gentlest he Must kiss for her kind Flout, again, as she Box'd him before. Then would she sing, rejoyce POLINDOR'S glad Eare with th' enchanting Voyce; At which all's glad, seem'd Soul'd, inspir'd anone, Stones, Statues, Trees; th' ORPHAEAN Lyre out-gone▪ Th'ayr's Road hush'd, yea, though bluring storms had fild Th'whole empty Round, 't had those Ayr-bedlams still'd Onely their Fountain seem'd yet weeping more, As Voyce on's pearly-streamed Nymph it bore. When young POLINDOR strait (grown wanton now) Mock-passions quaintly fram'd, with angry brow Threaten'd that Voyce (as 'twere) that Syren-tongue, Whom charged with Soul-rapes design: ere long Quarrell'd with th' Eye, that guilty'st check'd, upbraids With Black-art, dangerous Wild-fire, Look-granades; Challeng'd LOVE'S throned self, that there did sit, Though in his heart ask'd humble Pardon yet. Her ruby Lips, as Heart-blood stain'd, accuses, No smaller Crime, when suttlest Vengeance uses; As though their Crimson die would foce agen, Kiss-smother them: Th' admir'd FLOSTELLA when, Would sportingly quit Score, most prit'ly Arraign Each of his Guilty Features ore again: Yet still their mortall-seeming Difference ends At kissing-grapple, both made closest Friends. Here in these gloomy Shades (with th' other) ot They Din'd, they Supp'd; their warbling Minstrels brought Those plum'd-coat Songsters, chanting Nightingale, Shrill Blackbird, jolly Thrush: which should prevail In favour, straining, round their organ-throats: Whose Base supply'd the Fountains bubling noats: POLINDOR Butler seem'd (Cooke useless showes, Since cold food, Summer) Lips for Sweet-meat cloze. At either end oth' Bank ith Flat, between That and the fence (good spaces left) was seen
(A-cross) short closer Walk; each verdant side Stood comly'st planted Row, those being beside All Trees of shade, select, though various found; Palms, Myrtles, Cipress, thus prov'd shade Compound: Yet, taught their ranged-order too, so growing, That every Third's the same, like formed showing. Hither would walk sometimes the fair FLOSTEL, 'Midst Noon-day-blazes, from th' Adjoyning Cell Or Tarras-mount (whilst, pressing thus the Grass, 'Twould rising seem to Strut again, as 'twas Proud kiss'd her Foot) the lowly place Sun-proof: Both pleas'd for change beneath that Bow'ry roof▪ There oft spent th' Evening too, POLINDOR'S head Couch'd on her dainty'st Lap; when she would brede His silken longer Locks, then joyntly hold All close to's Head in some conceited Fold, Much like her own, the faces prospect seen, Cryes out; How well her self the Man had been, But he the Woman! who with mirth replies, So one the Man become, blest Destinies! The, all her former, busie, pleasing Pains She soon undoes agen, nor Smile refrains; Th' enlarged Hair leap'd from her hand so quick To sportive Curls anew, like wanton Trick, As 'twould again be play'd with: Stroaking when, She'd Curl, uncurl by turns; would now and then Give him light gentler Twich, though then must Kiss In kind amends, as 'twere: and as for this Bow'd down her Nimble Head, POLINDOR thought The Skies had fallen to th' earth, and two Stars shot: So heav'nly seem'd that Face, those sparkling Eyes So bright, so suddain (lastly) the Surprize. Love-stories then they'd tell; some smaller store FLOSTELLA had, though Truths, and conn'd before Knew squeamish Vestalls; these the Lady told With such choyce winning count'nance, did unfold
With so kind Sympathy (to please) as though Her self that Lover were, did sadly'st blow Those Sighes from her: so musically stream'd Each Passion forth, so true, POLINDOR seem'd Now faln in Love again, transported so, Forgetfull, he again could Sigh and WOO. When (last) they'd chant their own, whose briefer Story, Conjoyn'd with others, well might claim a glory In CUPIDS Chronicle (they thought) so full Of winding rare chance, pritty Miracle: With which POLINDOR'S Tongue and fondling Ear Seem'd so well pleas'd, by fits, Soul lull'd as 'twere (Her Brest the downy Pillow) glides it now Into that World of Slumber, knowes not how: Which seen FLOSTELLA strait with Charm-like Song Bound his Sence faster (double bands) nor long Sung sweetest Cherubin) thus prime Baloo, But gentlest Self, that might companion show To her dear Lord POLINDOR, slumbring bowes. Who (constant Youth) as Love's victorious Vowes Should conquer sleep and Death▪ dreams of his Fayr FLOSTELLA; thinks h' had lost his soveraign Star Sometimes, through Cloud; his Dove-mate vanisht gone: Thence grasp her precious Wast, by which alone Wak'd both himself and her: Who sober Smil'd, To view her Darling-lord so thought beguil'd, Fancy-fool'd (as she deem'd) much joy'd to see His vehement Love: far more rejoyced he, She found so safe, secure; and tells her o're His ominous Dream, part-known to her before. Thus liv'd they like that first most blessed Payr Of Innocence, th' whole World did joyntly share In this small corner, parcell, shar'd at least Love's rich stor'd Indian world ('twas wedding Feast Of full and freest sweet now) envy'd none, Since they thought thy ngrossed all Alone.
Here that prime Payr of loving Shepheardesses Revisit we; 'Twas thus; Friends oft addresses, Kind strongly'st pleaded Suits, being over-past Seav'n or eight daies, such Influentiall tast Found with DLCENZA, so (glad, lucky'st season!) That Fancy vayl'd (at length) in part to Reason, Gave yeilding way; sh' had eyes and ears agen For solid Counsayl, dreaming though till then. So that not onely gain'd to her access Those frequent Amorous Love-embassages, MENANDER'S Lines; regarded, courting Lute, Which gave t' her windowes oft sweet Morn-salute; But likewise Visits too (though meanly grac't) With moody'st tempers, lowring Looks ore-cast: Such stormy Gusts blew from the Lord POLIND (Those highest gallant Alps) clouding her mind And face to boot with doubtfull'st Weather oft: Though else, from th' inmost heart, disdaining nought MENANDER'S person, parts, nor his estate, Who woo'd her Coyness at the painfull'st rate Of humble and withall enduring Love. As close gentile SIRENUS too did move His mild MARPESAS brest, though found the Siege More happy far, whose often priviledge Kind Summer-looks, with few gain'd sweetest Kisses. First-fruits; those earnest to succeeding blisses; Possessing thence (ere long) th' hearts Magazine: Plow'd with more prosp'rous Gales that foamy Brine Oth' Lovers Ocean, towards PERU, That coast of Gold, whilst blustring Tempests blew MENANDER'S Bark; being thus: MARPESAS brest Less troubled through vain Hopes, desires, unrest (More calmly free) could better estimate True, worthy Love, since found her Own so late Slighted, refus'd. Thus (Reader) wings our Pen, With hast, to th' noble Hrmit-payr agen.
And now their sweetest Week was progress't o're; Fort nigh unvittayl'd grown, but thinnest store 'Gainst Famine-siege, and Storm, unless supplies From poor HERMONUS Ghost, or showring Skies. POLINDOR, loth to range TREGORS great Town As Catarer, least mark'd; and th' hired Clown That brought the meat might blab; nor was the place So safe, remote for longer time (alas) Scan'd second Thoughts: 'twas voted, joyntly agreed T' inform RUFIN, their Cordiall friend, with speed. No Messenger though to be got, procur'd; Nor, were there one, was th' noble Youth assur'd For point of Trust, himself must Agent prove; Four miles and half the way: though tendrest Love Bred Thoughts of foul dislike, diastrous grown So long to leave the dear FLOSTEL alone: Though knew that rocky Cell defensive made To wonder quiet'st Coast and calm; as sayd. Nor was the Lady damped much, or caugh Through Selvish fears; the dear POLINDOR'S thought Most troubled her. Thus then, that very Night. 'Twas Fixt, resolv'd: which being most Star-bright, Deck'd with the fainter Silver of the Moon, Th' old Hermits meaner Coat and Faulchion on (Found false Beard there by chance) by ten's best hour, He Kisses seald on his Belov'd, whole show'r; With which their Souls exchang'd, transferred are: She wrung his parting Hand, then, dropt a fair Tear on't (Love's juycy spirits) Charm 'gainst ill; Heaven-preservative; whose Chrystall Still, Her fair Eye, how he gently kiss'd agen, Sighe's kindest breath repay'd! Unlocked when The door, which lock'd again; then strait to Heaven Eyes solemn cast, as if to their charge given (Those bright eyd Starry Watch) his dearest All; As thus had sayd, O guard from wretched Thrall
Yours, mine, the wealthy Exchequer of the World; Key thrown within to her, he's dart-like hurl'd Towards their Shepheards vale. Way, not unknown, Since had to th' Woods spread gallant Borders gone With's great-horse oft; yet stray'd the Pilgrim too: Rouz'd up good old acquaintance with those few Kind Marks, for Mute informers; here his Hast Rebuk'd, chid there his slowness though, till past Two longer Hours, his Vncle up he rouzes. RUFIN inform'd of all, no moment looses; Bids, Cheer up, cries in mirth, They lov'd bold feats; To tread Love-mazes still; Recruit with meats He could their Fortress strait, but (as desir'd) Had gotten long since place more close, retir'd For both to Sojourn in: fine shady'st Grange, Choye-bow'r, Elizium-like. Thus, forth they range Like two Night-spirits, on their tedious way, Least should be over-took by th' Morning-ray. How prone young Lovers often seem (alas) To tread on troublous Cliffs, and icy waies, Shun'd safer-beaten Grounds! the Road refuse For doubtfull By-paths! often Circles chuse Prefer before the short directer Line! As here these seem'd, with Vestall Groves design: How love to Task their painfull Selves! as though Loves precious Sweets should more transcendent grow Through hardship, Danger! or (intruth) as LOVE So huge, so prime a Godhead were, 'twould prove Lord over fate; check Mischiefs surely fry! Or (lastly) as if conceiv'd so Rare, so high Th' exalted Love-life, that it must controul Lower vulgar wayes, despise the earthy Moal! Though freakish humour'd Fortune oft from thence Makes sportive Game on heedless Innocence. But here our Pen again to th' mateless Dove, Sweet'st best FLOSTELLA-turns; whose dearest Love,
Thought absent long, sad qualmish Dream besides Of Tombs, with Ghost-masque, up she rouzes, glides To th' window strait: Moon, Stars did glistering there Obsequions Hand-mayds shine; Shades seem'd to wear Mild, solemn Browes, her tallest Guard as 'twas; But nought so lovely did adorn the place As her POLINDOR'S view: My dearest Dear, O why so long? she cries. When nimbly here Pale doubt, desire, to th' Iron-door transport her, She peep'd once, twice through th' hole, but nought did court her Like that beloved Shape: when, back retir'd, Faln on her saddest Couch, there strait respir'd (First) od'rous Sigh from her; then, richest Tear Strain'd sweetly forth; and then th' Armes folded were As Moan'd her drooping Heart. She mus'd, computes His Journeys measure first; time fitly suits For th' Vncles rising too, then, for's return; Last, counting th' hours by th' Watch, begun to Mour (Her double Scoar cast nimbly up) as though The Time too long for th' labour, Task did show: Love too the Agent turn'd. Thus (short Alas Sigh'd forth) to th' Window prov'd her second race; Where faintly looking, What not yet? so bright? Ay-me! withall she cry'd: when dismall'st Sight, That Earth or Hell could belch forth, strook her Eyes. She view'd that worthy'st Youth, whom she did prize (Th'own Heart inform'd) next Heaven, brought between Two, Corps-like, slain, cross th' open part oth' Green; Born full-length, stript to's very Shirt (the Moon Whilst Gazing seem'd as sad Spectator on, Bright'st shining) crimson'd Shirt, with spots distain'd, Like bleeding Hearts as 'twere; whilst hung disdain'd Th' affrighted dangling Curls: upon his brest Smooth Taf'ty-role with pendant flap did rest, Faulchion neer: his Arme held forth to view (O dre!) broad gartig Ribbon, well she knew,
Conferr'd on him first day ith 'Vestall wood, And worn still wreathed round: whose Corps bestow'd Ith' planted Shade, those Men were vanish'd, gone. This Object view'd, O Horrour, scourge unknown! Heart's trembling gasps! O my Souls Hell (she cries) Sight, sight, enough to blast Heav'ns purer eyes, And Damp their sparkling Fires! O tenfold death! Ah Wo! Wo! Wo! why do I fondly breath, The world, my self Undone? farwell, farwell All Faith, Worth, lovely'st Grace, what could Excell; Joyes, fly for ever; gones my dearest All, And I'm no more. The Rock reounding wall Groan'd here her mournfull Eccho; Gem-like stream Of showred Tears, with Hayrs torn wealth, did seem Lavish'd on th' dusty ground; those whitest Hands Both wrung, as though, Fates sweetest countermands, They would Charm back their Orders rage, ore pow'r Work so prodigious: strangely Ecclips'd that hour Bright beauties World appear'd. I come, I com (Sayd she) ere long to share Love's martyrdome, Dear, dearest Youth, to tast last frozen Kiss So dye upon thee (once my living Bliss) Dear Corps I come. Here with what eager Passio Key's sought and found! when furious inspiration As though (wild Priestess-like) her limbs possessing, She flung to th' Iron Door, her fair Hands pressing Th' ore-churlish Bolt; hard troublous grapple 'twas; Being perform'd, forth hurry'd she, wing'd pace, Loud-voyc'd, Ah my POLIND! when suddenly Five Cut-throat Villains rush'd upon her, nigh Bruis'd with their rudest armes sweet'st Innocence, Heav'n in its type; true Dreams both proving thence. At which scarce startled (o) since these conceiving Those ugly Butchers, providence hope giving They'd soon dispatch her too; fierce Grief's Extream Stifling her naturall Fear, since dy'd with him
All further Lifes-joy; yet, to th' Soul confounded, They stop'd her loving Course, these words she ounded From dolefull passion'd brest. Come, welcome you My dear Lord's murtherers, since I shall Sue For that Death, freely thank you, which so late You forced upon him; though (Fiend-like hate!) Don't Kill me double: Range this smaller Cell, Whilst I but snatching take last poor Farwell, Then strike, strike home; I shall confess y'are Men. Here, urg'd to shew with Faulchion nak'd and keen, What, where the Prize; that being inform'd as soon, (Since all but Chaff, her dear POLINDOR gone) One Roague, less iron-brested, rudely leads To th' fatall-curtain'd Shade, whose sullen Beds Seem'd unto her Ghosts talk'd of Stygian Wood; Couch of all Ill. That place of true loves blood (Corps both) beheld, now blacker Sables lending, She took her swift Career, her flight though sending Sad'st mournfull Voyce before, and on his brest Falls like shot glistring Meteor. O thou best Of Men, but late (true Lovers honour, glory) But now of Ghosts (sayd she) though dismall Story Where worst of Fates inrol'd! I'm come, I'm come, My Dear (fast grasping her Joyes fancy'd Tomb, His body, neck) thy wretch'd, thy wretch'd FLOSTLLA (O Sound, compos'd of mischiefs) thus to pay My last Farwell! then, break my loving Heart: Ah cold! cold! Kiss of Death! (small sodain start Withall, she cries; Quick, hast; that Villain crying) Death's frost, alas! Then, blood-steep'd wounds espying▪ Ah! Crimson Founts, that you had cleerly flow'd (Sayd she) from my Heart; various slucy Road! Sad'st Ports (as 'twere) whence richest Soul convay'd O, had we not both One? why tardy stay'd My hapless Half behind? tru'st butchery! Twice, twice (almost) thou Swoonding dy'dst for me,
Now Dead indeed. O monumentall stif! No voyce? Souls breathed whisper? loathsome Life! Th'art torment, curse unto me: You, so late Cruell, now kind become; as your stern Hate Divorc'd us here on Earth; so (friendly) now Ioyn us again in Heaven; thus, I bow: O Kill me over my dead Lord, and Love. Here, stoop'd for death, when, as some Dream did prove, Amaz'd she started up, strong thoughts implying Twas not POLINDOR'S Corps. O you All-eying, All-knowing Pow'rs, am I awake? (she cries) Or are you pleased thus t' abuse mine eyes With soothing, painted Vision? is not this My Dear? POLINDOR? hah? such cordiall Bliss Own poor FLOSTELLA? whence that Taf'ty-role, Broad Ribbond, Faulchion then? my anguish'd Soul! It is not he; torn heart, 'tis not POLIND: Ah! liv'st thou, breath'st thou yet? some gentler Wind, Angel inform my doubts. O righteous heaven, Fain would I how escape the Stroak, but even For thy sweet sake: still doomfull threats of Fate. Horrours inviron me (th' unhappy Brat Cast out unto all Ill) Night, Death surround; Whilst Lost to thee, to mine own Soul, and drown'd In gulph of Sorrowes: O, fain would I Live, (My choycely esteem'd) since, those Heart wounds they give, Thou't Bleed through them to death; my Tragedy Must brooding cause thine, Both alas must Dye. Here seiz'd all Five on her: This was in truth That gentile Swain, call'd FLORIS (comely'st Youth) That Midnight-wanderer, by th' Vestall Grove Talk'd it so late with th' Eccho, his dead Love Lamenting unto Ghosts and griely shade, Where hop'd to find her still, ere yet convay'd To th' low'st Elizium: now doubly slain, In mind and body both; though comfort, gain
That last, whose Hearts wound seem'd to cure his heart▪ Lanc'd Grief's imposthume thus (most blessed smart) And Fates were kind in it, since Life might show His burden, torment: Doo much honour'd too; Since Mourned, Wept (what higher solemnizing) By GREECES glory, boast: Thus prov'd the thing. These Cut-throat Roagues, far-straglers, most of whom Were once that false BRUNDESCAR'S Men, the scum Of that base Villains fry (whom his Moor-slave, Vext through his torturings at length, grown brave Through Fury, chanc't to murther, Stab, when lying In's Summer-house (though mark'd howe're for dying. Since should have been that Even as Traytor seiz'd) These Ruffian-villains, for long time profess'd Grim Landlords of the Road, now growing poor, Sought hunted for, slunk hither th' Ev'n before; Meaning next day, some Port marine attain'd, To turn Sea-robbers all, th' unfriendly Land Less favouring them. Thus, greedy of prize and blood Scouting along they saw where took the Wood Young FLORIS, out of reach; more silent then More Mute, by fits; thought-bury'd (Wretch of men▪) Seeking new distant Quarters, dismall Shades Dark as his cloudy'd Brest: Each roundly invades That same Path, dog'd the Lover, soft as Ayr (Still big with Sullen thoughts, Profound dispayr) For Booty: though conceiv'd, some Lodge close by Might mend their single Prize. Till now, drawn nigh, He entring just within the door oth' Gren All leapt upon him, where (swords, hearts too keen) Thrust forth by Stabs his noysless, musing Soul Through bleeding Doors: the Corps then softly stole (Born fullest length 'twixt two) yet somewhat lower Cross-green, ith' Ladies view, whilst his Brest bore That Rol'd cap, Faulchion both; there hasty lay'd, Whilst carry'd him to th' next entombing Shade.
As for that Role, with dangling flap, 'twas still Worn by those Shepheard-swains of birth gentile, As choyce distinct Badge; such still wore POLIND; Although had left (indeed) his own behind For th' Hermits meaner Hat, chang'd just at door When going forth, though less observ'd by her: That naked Faulchion one oth' Theeves did claim; And that Arm-ribbon (worn) kind Favour came Long since from his Belov'd, CRESSA the fair. Through all these Marks his comelyer youth, his hair, Stature, time, place concurring; sadder Dreams, Love-fears too, 'twas POLINDOR'S Corps she deems: Hid more a while through double Night, her passion, And that dark Shade to boot. Thus, hasty fashion Their Corps thrown down, one spying strait the Cell (More booty promis'd whence) conceiving well This for true Owner; falling back, they All Wheel'd more about (unseen) to th' blind side wall By th' shaded Pond; till, just the door ope passing, All seiz'd her Pris'ner thus, to th' Souls amazing. The Cell thus rifled, cleer'd, they hal'd her strait Along with them, threatning Deaths dismall fate If ought refus'd; Who, though her horrid Fear (Sweet'st Soul!) prov'd living Death, chose rather there Thus to be drag'd by them in lower fashion, Since hoping thence more Time for preservation: What piteons glancings back to th' blisfull Cell! How Sigh'd to all her Ioyes in that, farwell! Thus, passing 'midsts that black and ugly'st Crew, Th' first, pure, created Light, when breaking through Chaos, she seem'd; or in some moving Cloud Wrapt Lightning-flash: then't shew'd, as if that croud Of Nights brats had pluck'd down the silver Moon (Which then prov'd hid, obscur'd) that Darkness soon Mght choak th' whole Earth; as though they'd massacre All Excellence, what's counted perfect, rare.
Dismall death's Progress 'twas, when drowsie Heaven, Iustice, boh tranced seem'd; and Rapine even Govern'd the World. One while her Tongue implores Th' arch-villains, then th' Heav'ns highest Pow'rs adores▪ Both Equall-deaf; she look'd upon Trees, Stars, Whilst t' one, but skreen'd their Ruffians, t' other dares Hold Light to th'barborous work; whose Lmps yet burn∣ing, Should rather (their Skie-sockets over-turning) Fall on their heads; Nought seem'd with hopes to flatter▪ All's quiet, lull'd, as Hell had brib'd whole Nature To one grand Villany. Thus, reach'd the Path, That trod some smaller while (though with less faith) They chang'd their Course into the right-hand Wood (Her Plaints then doubling) one oth' Cut-throat brood Sounding small Whistle rait, to which Another Answer'd for sign again (being sixt sworn Brother Did tend their Wardrobe with their prize, far off) That neerly'st follow'd they, where, safe enough, They might first Ravish her, then, slaughtering kill; 'Twas Second-course to th' last, daintier blood still. That month too PLUTO, God of wealth and prize, They us'd to please with fair She-sacrifice (Mayd, Widow, Wife, no matter which, so one) Now far more strict, Devout, more bloody grown; That PLUTO might, since dangerous fears at hand, Safe Guard, protect them, whilst were yet on Land. Ah, poor POLINDOR! little do'st thou know Th' whole smarting Worlds, but most thy fatall Blow: Does no kind Gale sigh, whisper't in thine are? No Thunder roar it out? nor Earthquake bear The trembling newes? such monstrous Prodigies Would sute such monstrous foul Acts) do not Skies Blaze it in flarry text? or's loytring, sleeping Thy Guardian-angel now? rather, blood weeping, Gasps not thine own Heart forth their errand? crying, Fatality! all worth, all beauty's Dying.
H'st thou but kept the Key! but 'twas love's Fault, That over-hasty made, forgetfull that; Though (truly) if lost, or forc'd from thee Death's stroak If seiz'd by th' way, then had she starv'd ith' Rock, Thy Death she falsly morn'd, but hapless Thou (Part chang'd) may'st Mourn hers justly, truely'st now. Poor Wretch! too late (alas) and yet too soon Thou com'st at once, to find thy self Undone. Those lufty Travaylers, with eager hast, Attain'd to th' bulky Wood at length, and pass'd Along the right side, scouting, when a Noys, Most Faint surprised them, and saddish voyce That seem'd to boot: POLINDOR'S bowels roul'd, As if's own Flesh, some Spirit did unfold 'Twas his FLOSTELLAS Tongue: When, neerer going, Mo Like it prov'd, the very same Voyce showing, Dire, dismall too become: Worst destiny! Hast noblest Youth FLOSTELLA 'tis, 'tis She As gasping Men do snatch at Soul (as 'twere) When on their wing, so seem'd his greedy eare Strait at this precious Voyce; it seem'd the Knell To all perfection, last dying Peal To th' Vniverse. Strait both their nimble paces Were doubled, yet withall each lightly traces, Least Noyse dispatch'd her soon; now heard they more, It brokenly (strength spent) call'd on POLINDOR— LINDOR—DOR; as resolv'd that Name should sweet Her dying last Breath, and convey in it, Hug forth her gentle Soul; one Medley almost That name, sighes, groans become; till now, all's lost Sd, dreadfull'st Silence following, whilst of Death Thence show'd, through latest gasps, exiring breath. When Tiger-like rush'd in, there strait appear'd To th' nimble glance, small rude Turf-altar rear'd; With Flow'rs, bright Faulchion glistring on't; th' one side im Taper sickly burn'd, oth' other spy'd
Long, prostrate, Womans Corps (lower half) display'd On th' sadly enriched ground: whose Sight portray'd Some new done Sacrifice, Snatch'd joyntly there (By chance) two Targets up, which scatter'd were On th' idle soyl, POLINDOR made the First (Partly unwares) to Vomit forth th' accurst Foul Soul (most active, strong, of spirit undaunted Love-fir'd to boot) then, churlish Second graunted Deaths, hells joyn'd Pass-sport; whilst RUFIN the Thir Sent to fright Ghosts: POLINDORS hungry Sword (Wrist scratch'd) unkennell'd Soul oth' sturdy Fourth▪ Next, with RUFIN (found closely'st grappled, wor Timely aide) dispatch'd the damned Fifth; Sixth fled Then, running to th' Worlds wonder (once) earth sprea Half-nak'd FLOSTEL, he found her Corps-like lying; Cheeks rufull'st-pale, Death's Scutcheon, more then dying. At which turn'd raging, furious, Hour of doom! Strange, horrid'st Spectacle, that Midnights Womb Ere swell'd with; cries: call'd on her fairest Clay, Cry'd, 'Twas POLINDOR call'd. Each needfull way Mean while RUFIN, long skilfull'st Artist, us'd; Beg'd heavens Ayd, hot, powerfull'st Spirits infus'd For th' brain (glass born about him) since appear'd Yet no Deaths wound, nor bruise; most strangling (And strangled still those Off-springs prov'd, it seems▪ To Pluto, quart'ring next their prostrate Limbs) Rub'd, bow'd her body oft. Ab horrour! (crying Th' ore-whelm'd POLINDOR here) you never- Powrs, O blast me too, my Life, since take My Souls Joy comfort from me; rack! Souls Rack! All worth, sweet's vanish'd. Throughly bath'd RUFI Her Brest with soveraign Cordiall uyce ('twas sin Conceiv'd, when found without it) chaf'd her bow Whilst th' Other; though, grand chance cold Water (Theeves pitcher by) some drops were thrown upon Dire task! POLINDOR still, still calling on her,
Loud'st voyce, FLOSTELLA, dear FLOSTELLA; O, Why tread'st thou this vile earthly Mass below? Its Gem, choyce treasure gone, she soar'd above! Sweet'st, fairest Soul! when now, discern'd to move; He calling still, FLOSTELLA, Dearest: Rare Th'whole prospect, sight t' have seen that World of fair, Of sweet, and lovely as 'twere new-created, New beauteous-Soul'd; each wonder, grace restated In Cheeks, Lips, gallant'st Forhead; those Sun-eyes Break forth their Morning-lids, while th' eastern Skies SOL brake as 'twere to view't, just then; though glanced That Day-break but from these, POLINDOR fancy'd (His day of joyes at least) most fresh and warm Ere long she growes: Heav'ns goodness, and that Charm POLINDOR'S Voyce have crown'd, reblest the World. When strait into her dearest bosome hurl'd, With strictest Folds, with warm but eager Kisses He new endanger'd her; 'midst which Love-blisses Both seem'd awhile Intranc'd, their mutuall kind Souls whispring thus sad Tales (as 'twere) intwin'd, Moaning each other. How through dismall fear, Spent Spirits (loathsome Rape and Death so neer) That Swoonding seiz'd, one gasping Roague confest; Ore-heard by glad POLINDOR: There did rest Th' whole Booty, prize, with hundred pounds beside Oth' Theeves in gold (that lately was Blood-dy'd) Rang'd by RUFIN; who both with voyce awaking, POLINDOR (lo) first silence breaks, Love making Hi Ioyes thus sweetly'st known. And, O you Skies, You Pow'rs of lasting Daylight, do these eyes Behold sent back my dearest Dear (as 'twere) Froms shades of Death? from your own blisfull Sphear Rather, where meant some Star-bestudded Throne: Blest Flight, return! These also th' Hoour done (These Hands) to bleed some purple for her sake! Some drops! thereby redeeming her from Wrack,
From double Death of Ravishmnt and slaughter (As she twice reskew'd me) th' unequall'd Daughter Of all your glory, praise! O mercy ador'd! When she, again; And has kind Heav'n restor'd As 'twere from Field of ghosts, my dearest Gem? So long lamented in that dismall Dream As Dead, though in the shape of wretch'd another? My lifes-guard, Champion too conjoyn'd to th' other (Whose blood might Kisses stanch! to beauteous skars Tears balm improve! th' hurts bound with mine own ▪) Blest change of Fate! how precious sweets Reprive! Now onely do I Live, since thou Alive! Take thy Swords conquer'd Prize, and be that kind Trance thank'd, which made me to thy Danger blind. Thus holds he all Earths lovely'st wealth re-given; Chief providentiall Favour deign'd, next Heaven. Whilst round the Place, wak'd with her former Groans, Fight, Break of day to boot, their warbling tones Chirp'd loudly forth those Wood-inhabitants (Prime Morning-consort) each how frolick vaunts Their joy, their skill! seem'd thus Congratulate To both at once, FLOSTELS revived fate; With Reuniting of this worthy Payr; Thus, stream'd with Caroll'd mirth both Wood and Ayr So strangely pow'rfull, influentiall proves True noble Lov, that Brutes themselves it moves. And here, most jealous grown the fair FLOSTEL, Through late unhappy Fright oth' lonely Cell (Though Singular event, strange wonder 'was) Nor seem'd so distant, safe, secure the Place As wish'd, indeed; 'twas voyced o're and o're For th' dainty'st private Grange: next Town TREGO Would Coach them for their Voyage fitly too: Thus, Both intwin'd, they softly'st travers'd through Those twinkling Shades to th' bord'ring Medows sid RUFIN their Porter grown, love's God their guide
When strait, as Burthen to that former Song, Sad Voyce amaz'd them both, conceiv'd a throng Of bitter Sighes, and sobs, complainings, WO (As th' froward Morn were proudly brooding too Her Viperous mischiefs) seem'd as th' Heart 'twould break, Death thus forestall'd, contemn'd; that manner wreak Vengeance on Fate. Which strange tune, perfect mourning Drawn neer, they Womans Gar discry'd; and turning Her head about, who should (alas) this be But poor ARDINA, th' Nurse, unhappy she! Who, having reach'd that Vestall mansion, late O're Night, with strange events oblig'd to wait On her beloved Lady there: anon Inform'd by all, that she was wander'd, gone For Thracias Kingdome, none knew where (though most She feard (indeed) through desperate Sorrow lost) Lost in her own Mind, Way to boot, through passion, Sh' had roam'd it thus all night in dolefull fashion. Who cleerly view'd, FLOSTELLA, stoln behind, Cry'd (grasping) Take thy Mistress; when th' ore-kind Transported Wretch was neer unto Ioy-swoon, How hug'd, how kiss'd her! wept! nor could be soon Convinc't (intrth) but 'twas her Ladies Ghost: Though when inform'd, as Spouse by her ingrost That fine, compleat, young Lord (to boot) O , Had not the Lady timely'st kiss'd it in, Her Soul had doubtless leapt forth, took Vagary As had her body late. Thus, mean brests carry Sound truest Hearts oft-times; till now, restor'd Full to her self, tongue breath did joyntly accord To speak their weighty News, though late at strife'. COMMANDRA, great ARPLASTUS proudest Wife, Having for all that wanton season past Held true to him (if Whorish Loves, unchast Worth noblest Style of truth) scarce added now Nine full months more, when sacred Marriage-vow
More strongly oblig'd her too't, begins to rave Through ordid new Lusts; which (although she gave Slight Honours check sometimes) within few daies Burst forth most furious Flame, whose wanton blaze Sought but convenience: good Choyce in loving, As had ARPLASTUS done before, approving. Thus, rarely'st Innocence, once being stain'd, Found purg'd and wash'd white; Virtue lost, regain'd. Besides, this Blew th' hot wanton Forge, a Son (To towring'st honours, fortunes th' heir alone) Most greedy of; and doubting much her Lord, Since no Sign, Blossome yet (th' unchast Accord Those former six years too) she'l change condition, Diet, try more: so serve both Lust, Ambition. The Object, Person prov'd gentile and fine, CYPRIAN by birth; not Natures mean Design For face and limb, spruce-modell'd, handsome Peice (Her Graces Vsher, lo) conjoyn'd to this Prime voyce, rare Musick's art: whom her close Favour, Amorous enough before, had now taught braver Bold Feats, exploits; since Looks can paint desires (Each Touch grown kind and Mystick) blaze heart-fir. Thus, now some fortnight past, ARPLASTUS rod To far-fam'd Hunting match, 'twas spacious Wood Ten miles from home; where meant some following nights To rest with bord'ring friend, 'mid sport-delights. But so it chanc'd, that busie Morn, a Fray (Sport's rougher Wrong-side oft) at bleeding bay Set th' Hunting-masters, men themselves turn'd Cus; Some bauling Dog or Mistress th' angry stirs Ingendring first; from words they grew to wounds: Smart Siding, parties follow'd, till their Hounds At length most Morall seem'd; 'twas turn'd to Chase Or fray of silvan Bores: which bloody place, Foul Clashings wisely ARPLASTUS left, withdrew. And being inform'd, his Friend was wander'd too
Far off, with's totall train (th' intruding Plague, Death, his Joynt-tenants left) as Witch or Hag Had crost with ill luck, back he gallopt home, Vext, heated; Noon much over-past being come, Wife forth, he walk'd directly (softly'st pacing) Towards that coolest Grot, SOL's beams out-facing: Where with's own Key that outward Door oth' ground Vnlocked first, to th' Summer-house chief bound. Drawn neer, some gentler Sattins russle scar'd (Such, Wind, Leaves whispring noyse) joyn'd Hm; ore∣heard These, twice, thrice o're; when Darting strait his eye Through th' empty Lockhole there (Soul-blasted nigh, Turn'd wondring Statue) strange Lust-antick rack'd That way his Heart: COMANDRA ith' very Act With her own formall Cringer, Conge-man, 'Twixt whom Himself seem'd merely butcher'd, Slain: His first Lusts wages, this. When grown all fir'd (Suddain thoughts too, through her damn'd art expir'd Sweet'st, best ORANTHES Life) the baudy Door His own Key open'd strait; then, griping th' Whoor, Keen Dagger coupled closely with her Heart, Till hug'd her Soul from thence; cool, new Love-dart: The Man escaping: Thus has righteous Heaven Payd poor ORANTHES Ghost, at one made even Sad, double Scoar. This dismall dalliance ended, He storm-like hurry'd back, ere long attended To's Chamber, Bed, where violent Feaver burn'd; Through rage and th' former heat; his Body turn'd All Furnace, torrid-zoan: th' incensed Blood Sulphureous boyling Streams, whilst Guts they shew'd Rolls of match, fir'd: Thus, th' Oyl consum'd, exhausted (Juyce, Spirits gone) Life's Lamp soon lauguish'd, wasted. What time, ARDINA, bed confined too Through sickness (nor great hast) defer'd to shew Her dearest Lady ought (whom promise ty'd Ne're to take Vestall Vow, till specify'd,
First known to her) now were th' whole Frals o're: Though this for Cordiall joyn'd, ARPLASTUS wore Good Father's parting heart; and, dying Kind (His lands turn'd o're in trust) did strongly'st bind Her Vncle ANSELVIN, late from Sea return'd (Though long believ'd for dead, deplored, mourn'd) To give up all upon his Daughters claim, Which Nobly'st offer'd, ere ARDINA came. Such was th' Event; the sweet'st FLOSTELLA hear Her Fathers death with sobrest filiall Tears, Kind Fun'rall-show'r; most melting, most soft-hearted: Till all must comfort her, Alleadg'd, sh' had smarted Much through his Fondness; reading wisely thence Rare, signall Act of divine Providence. And now that Prince of day had (pow'rfull) rays'd The World from nights dark Chaos, Mountains blaz'd And Woods, with golden Brows, fine golden Tresses (Tranc'd Earth awak'd, when Men made their egresses For work, for pastimes) whilst those Winged Quires Chnted their Morn-devotions to SOL's fires: How seem'd to pride himself in Beamings round, Whilst view'd his Half-words Lordship, globy ground. Here strait RUFIN rouz'd himself for TREGOR, Mile off, t' hire speedy Coach from thence, for more Conveyance, health; their feeble Lady tyr'd; Whose Body, Mind to boot (though so admir'd, Angellick-pure) ore-powr'd, now drooping shew'd Too much sad Fraylty (alas) of Flesh and blood. When empty Coach, four horses, whirl'd apace Close by them for TREGOR (which very place All aym'd at) to fetch some Gallants thence; Him strait they Fee'd, more quick convenience. Arriving there, the Lady safe was shrouded In close Out-cottage strait (so's lost, ore-clouded Bright Cithia oft; so skulk'd in earthen Cell Gems lodge: so couched (lastly) ith' simpler Shell
Does th' orient Pearl appear) though spruce and neat: When choycest Cordials sought with busie sweat, Procur'd by skill'd RUFIN (life-ayds, supports) Thence to Recruit in Natures weaken'd Forts Their dear spent Spirits▪ th' Ayr that morning-hour Quicken'd by art, through Influentiall pow'r Of certain strow'd Herbs, Plants, whilst sweetly rise (Fuming tow'rd Heav'n in kind of Sacrifice) Rich Od'ro clouds, to cheer, refresh her Brain: Last, drowsie Juyce receiv'd by Sleep does raign O're her ineebled World; th' offensive Light, Noyse banish'd round▪ all's turn'd to Scean of night: The God of slumbers (Amorous grown) imbracing Her lull'd Sece, twenty-hours; disquiets chasing. Thus, that next Morn, fresh▪ travayl-proof she Wakes Seldome Heav'n moanful Virtue long forsakes. Though know, that day before (as meet) RUFIN Transferr'd unto her Vncle their design By nimble Post, that they would visit him This second Night, least else surprized seem (ANSELVIN whom by Name we styl'd of late) When, going back, he chanc'd congratulate Old Merchant-friend of his; possest by whom Four curious TYRIAN Robet (that were become His late Sea-prize) for Male and Female those, From thence for PERSIAN Prince and Princess chose: Though Two most richly gorgeous found, esteem'd (Whereof anon) Two, rich, but slighter-trim'd: Choyce Garb, much in th' ARCADIAN Court allow'd. That slightest Manly Robe, which seem'd less proud, Was purple Sattain Suit, loose-formed Coat; Long-button'd both with silver Flowr's, fine-wrought: But her's Aurora-sattin, shone, th' adorning Bright Silver trayls, for Lace. These second morning Were fully view'd, and bought by th' noble Payr; How primely fit! th' Occasion too so rare.
Since publick Objects growing now, more ey'd Gaz'd at, for Sun-like rank, estate beside. Those meaner-trim'd, much Nobler then their own, Fresh too, for Travayl-garb were then put on. Th' Host well discharg'd; with whom that Hundred pound Oth' Theeves was left; proclaimed which if found None th' Owner, 'twas decreed for th' hungry Poor. Thus All, well-coach'd to th' wish, by early hour Set prancing forth, the Morn whilst smiling show'd; Seem'd glad FLOSTELLA thus was come abroad (Proud t' Vsher her) which being withdrawn, ore-past; Bright PHBUS driving now his Steeds, with hast, Down th' Azur'd western road, with Charret blazing (As though kind Harbinger) their light wheels grazing Those pleasant flowry Plains; ere-long (beguil'd Through over-hast) they pass'd small Forrest, wild, Unused track: yet onwards still they stray'd, All's Chanting, erdant, sweet: When th'are dismay'd Soft Groanings, cries (scarce heard) like some tormented, Stroaks louder much: when further lo's presented, Through smaller Glade, this horrid Sight to view (Nor blaz'd much Danger in't) 'twas onely Crew Of five or six Hags, muffled, all surrounding Naked Man bound; with Whipcord-scourges wounding Or Burchen Rods. Both hands were closely knit To Tree's strong upper Branch, whilst shackled feet Fast ty'd to th' stumps below; thus, all expos'd Th' whole Body stood, full dismall Mark; though clos'd His glove-stop'd mouth, thence stifling louder Mon. Drawn neer, his Body gor'd with blood, like one Entire sore seem'd to view; or as, the Skin New Shifted, fley'd, 't had for some Shambles been: Most hideous Lump, grown doubly Nak'd▪ yet still Those Bayted round his flesh like anvill, steel (Th' unmatch'd Hell-beadles) as they'd conjure out His vagrant Soul: oft crying thus th' whole Rout;
Dog, Villain, we are Furies come to plague Thy vile flesh. Busy'd thus, one pursie Hag Spying RUFIN, All turn'd to wondring gaze; He seem'd half-charmed too, joy'd heaven 'twas To th' tortur'd VVretch this smaller truce, whose Groan, Look double pitty crav'd. When, ask'd anon The cause of all; Twas he (those Hags reply) Had done those cruell Thefts, those Raepes hard by (Purse-eech, Flesh-devill) Providence thus bound him; And they were Furies sent from Fate, to wound him. RUFIN star'd more; POLINDOR with FLOSTEL (Hood down) approach'd them, May-game, masque of Hell Th' whole Sight appear'd: Til now, his freer tongue Releas'd, No Theef (he loud exclaim'd) they wrong; 'Twas he was rob'd bound. When th' whole Antick fry With strange Signes rounded them, more mutteringly Disclos'd the Riddle strait, why all was done: That STORGUIS 'twas, that vile BRUNDESCARS Son; ASTORIN's downfall (whom by face RUFIN Well knew) who, proving th' Fathers Heir in sin, Worse Villain, had blood-suck'd (as 'twere by pow'r Most of their Husbands chief estates, that hour Lay'd Gasping; ravish'd too three of their Daughters (This had he likewise heard) those Virgin-slaughters Added to th' first: as then kept one his Whore: Thus, Neighing on, till tempted yet one more To her Fames death; close Pander-letters wooe, That she would meet that Noon ith' Cave below, Where should find Golden show'rs. This, wisely scan'd, The Mayd to th' Mother shew'd, whose cunning hand Wrote back from her, she'd wait on him, if so He'd come by stealth: when strait th' whole injur'd row, Those wives and Mothers met; their Husbands lay Lodg'd in that Cave, disguis'd, like men of Prey (Forg'd plot) where seiz'd, then left him nak'd and bound: Those gone, these (Muffled, Arm'd) did thus surround
Like Stygian Furies, sent to fall upon him▪ So, wrought in part their griev'd heart Vengeane on him, Nor knew he whence the Wrong: those men conceiv'd Meer Robbers, Theeves; while th' Hags souls Guilt believ'd Plain Furies come from Hell. The whole Justice show'd; Whose treacherous Father ended too in blood. This said, whilst they th' Arch, punish'd Roague unbind, Those Hags were vanish'd all, and gone like Wind. STORGUIS they left at next Wood-bordring Cell, Though scarce could lye nor sit (intruth) to steal Short Napping-fit; POLINDOR well from hence Lesson'd by th' way, 'gainst Rapine, Violence. Thus, prancing forwards, All betimes (ere night) Approach'd that second Eden of delight, FLOSTELLAS stately'st Home; where round the place Bow'rs, Meadowes, Groves, as with new Summers face (Fresh-drest, as 'twere, through new rare influences) Welcome their Mistress seem'd: from Leavy fences Birds chant their prayse in Hymenean song, Each Bush turn'd jolly quie; whilst Flowry throg Low-bended as 'twere, Cursey-homage showing (Gale-mov'd) their Pasture-way with perfumes strowing; Skies smiling round; West, Morn-like blushing, fair, Bride-cheek'd, as strove FLOSTELLAS self to Payr; Whence Sun did seem to Dart in amorous Blaze VVelcome, goodnight to both: Thus, on they pass. VVhen, neer her Mansion, forth th' adjoyning Thick Small Rustick troop appear'd, cloath'd, furnish'd like Harvests sons Daughters; sprucely'st trim'd to the Ey; Men Sickles bore, tost, flourish'd sprightfully, Whilst Women Rakes; their gallant Hat of straw, Joyn'd Flowry brooch to each: All deck'd they saw With wreath'd Wheat-girdles round. But know the Twai Which led both Sex, as eithers Soveraign (Fine, jolly payr) were these; the God of Wine, BACCHUS, whose curled head, swoln wast intwine
Grapes Gem-like clusters; in whose hand there show'd Glass-bottle of Grapes pure and sprightly Blood. His mate cors Goddess, CERES, quaintly'st crown'd With Gold-er'd sprigs; like Circl did surround Her wast too, Basket sh' had, adorn'd enrich'd VVith Fruits gay wealth: Both these (by turns) beseech'd The Lady tast this from their fuller store, In country-rhimes; small Earnest 'twas of more; VVhat Corn and Wine to both should yearly abound, Fruits of the blisfull Womb, as well as ground. VVhich Guift most kindly took, with Richest smile, That sweet'st of Women (back repay'd the while) From her Town-tenants, who conjoyn'd had made This rude Masque: Dance for sooth (for cloze) they had Till whisper'd by RUFIN, their dance was yet Less suited to her Mind, that merry Fit Was layd aside: Now th' open Gates they view. Where noble ANSELVIN, with some Remnant-few Her Fathers good old Servants, ranged stands; Who, doubly joy'd (indeed) those slavish Bands Of vile COMANDRA shatter'd broke, beside, Sweet'st face of their Young Lady (long lost) ey'd; All burst forth into sober, downright Crying: Loud'st Welcome, that, words empty ayre out-vying. Lighted, ANSELVIN closely strait intwin'd His lovely'st Neice, as Steward all resign'd; Whereof (her Eye first sweetly'st cast to Heaven; Then, Gratefull'st pearly Tear as off'ring given) With kindest Lip-heart-welcome, frankly she POLIDOR Master makes; as Noblest he Had crown'd her his hearts Mistress, long before: Thus, proved All her own still, never more. See what Heav'ns can produce, how blisfull Morrow Pregnant with Ioyes, as fable Night with sorrow! We shall not (Reader) here that Evenings talk, Actions recount, each pleasant Garden-walk,
How view'd by both; those stately'sts Founts and Mases; There th' Lady shew'd, COMANDRAS first kind Blaz, Toyings burst forth; her Young ORDELLAN there Courted with Masques both gazing eye and eare: There pointed she to th' Bow'r, where first Love-potion: Held forth to her, that Candy'd amorous motion There had she traced oft with Folded armes, Fixt eyes on Earth and Heaven, those cunning Charms Of hers, those spleenfull Spights (at length) t' oppose; How Sigh'd, mus'd, wept! There, for conclusion, show That doubly amorous and fatall Grot (Fatall to th' Whoor) nor lastly was forgot That dancing Antick stage, the adjoyning Grove; Oft whilst POLINDOR did with th' armes of Love Intwine his Spouse, how breathing forth Soul even In Ioyes to her, and thankfull Praise to heaven! Next morn, this Epithalm (next th' Ayery quire) Saluted both, well sung to th' Roman Lyre; Spark of ANSELVIN's love, poetick fire. SONG. 1. Choyce Planet-pair, by Heavens design'd (Thse old surpassing) For Conjunction, live combin'd (Through whose imbracing Worth survives, Perfection lives) Star-race on us bestowing; Whilst to skies amazement gives, Each SOL or VENUS showing. Mix rayes, Eye-beams joyn in looks, As Hearts in kisses, Nights joyes; True love-copling sucks Forth Souls in blisses: Bath thy flames Young Sun, she shames
THETIS, Loves dearer Ocean; Thou't rise more glorious, all Ioy claims Her Touch, Ice then takes motion 3. Flesh and blood's AMBROSIA th' hast, Earth's Dainty, treasure; Fathome well thou mayst her wast, But nere thy Pleasure; Fram'd she is For Extasies, Vnions high'st sweet; excelling: Love's Indies, World, dear'st All's in this, Man's longings paralelling. Give her thy All agen; Coyn Beauties, Virtues, till your Ten Twenty-fold selves deck th' Orb terree. Mean while ORTHERIS (bury'd man to all These weighty great things) Pensive treads the Vale, Through former harsher Stars, those late unkind; Though chiefly tost within his various mind This late strange Dream, or mystick Vision. He seemed couch'd upon some Rock, alone (While's wandring Sheep beneath) whose crest or'e-peer∣ing Vast' troubled Sea; Winds loudly chas'd, Waves rearing To fight against the skies; Skies storm'd agen With Cataracts; 'midst which tumulteous Scean; Foul discord, fairest Vessell seemed tost, Bandy'd to Ruin quite, where sunk and lost The Lord POLIND. When Sea more swelling high Conceiv'd in his own Brest, th' heart wracking nigh All turn'd, oth' suddain, dainty'st calm and whist Like lull'd Babes, smooth as cheeks of Virgins kis't Soft Gale the wrincled Main: delicious season! When floating Temple, lo (thing strange to reason)
Came towards him upon the Sun-guilt Wave; Whose Tarras'd open front Masque-prospect gave Of Gods and Goddesses, there stately enthron'd: At whose feet (though) choyce Favourites there own'd, Young Man and Mayd appear'd, resplendent shining, Close-arm'd, with Nuptiall wreaths and robes combining, Shap'd like POLINDOR just FLOLTELLA fair. Formost rod Nymphs on Dolphin-backs, which bare Flow'r-baskets others sweetly'st Harp'd, as though Still'd thence th' Ayrs broils, & charm'd mad Depths be∣low To Sleep, with their Marine harmonious Noyses Till reaching now the Rock, all mounted, Voyces Harps joyn'd; those formost Nymphs still strowing round Rose, Violets, till turn'd to VENUS ground; Love's Bridall Shore. These handmayds follow'd soon That beam-encompass'd Cluster (each as Sun Rouz'd from the Flood) with godlike, ayery paces: Drawn neer, APOLLO first advanc'd, forth traces, POLINDOR in his hand, whom gently does Present to th' Duke ORTHERIS, speaking thus. Here Retir'd Lord, take thy brave Gem-son from the watry Grave; Born in HYMENS Temple to thee, With such favours Gods do woo thee: Take him too as dropt from Skie, Through whom, nere thy Fame shall dye. Then step'd forth PALLAS with th' unequall'd Nay Who seem'd divinely Blazing too, and sayd, Thy Pearl-daughter from the Tomb Take again, as from Deaths Womb; Chang'd though Name and Face, thou hast Daughter still, more lovely grac't; Choycest blessing Heav'n could give, In whom KALASP, DORISBE live. Then HYMEN marriage-god, and stately'st she Births Goddess, JUNO, march'd forth solemnly; Joyn'd both their Hands, whose words did thus agree:
None these Hands Hearts dare to sever; Grow your Ioyes unnumber'd, ever. This sayd, All vanish'd round, though leaving there That young joyn'd Couple (favour still) howere: When strait ORTHERIS sleeps Bands wildly broke (Or were't some Trance) through wonder, joy awoke▪ Here, riding post, RUFIN the strange Event Broke wisely to him; though, by joynt Consent, Masquing that dangerous Nuns plot, design; As though meet Fear did all that while confine To some dark place, the closely espoused Payr: ORTHERIS when, as born a new the rare POLINDOR, lent from Death to life, rejoyces; Approv'd besides his Noblest best of Choyces: Her Father too, whilst both were Young, design'd His Brother-travayler, both neerly twin'd In strictest forraign League; oft Friendship proving Endeared more through dangers, stronger-loving: Yea, whilst an Infant was, had kiss'd beside, Oft Dandled in his armes the lovely Bride. Nor heighten'd least that rarest Trance, or Dream, Wherein th' Immortall troop of Gods did stream Full show'rs of blessings on him; told RUFIN, Thus, threatning Visit (o) though fondly seen Th' ill-look'd World once agen, till view'd his fair Reviv'd DORISBE in her (much brighter Star) Quick winged Post was strait dispatch'd, to tell What time precise: which noblest Promise well The Duke perform'd, sixth day for th' Journey chusing; Arriv'd; whose presence Ioy through all diffusing. Next day was kept their solemn Bridall Feast, Huge, pompous-garnish'd; many a Lordly guest, Knight, Lady there, whose gallant joyned port Shone with the Lustre of some Princes Court: All things most gorgeous left, for houshold-state, To th' ready hand, by prov'd COMANDRA late.
Forth came the Bridesgroom and the lovely'st Bride, Clayming all eyes, all hearts to boot; discry'd The most Accomplish'd most transcendent Payr Throughout the World; great Heavens wisdome, care Ador'd, in so well Forming, Matching them: Each of their Sex conceiv'd th' amazing Gem: Whilst Wept some kinder Hearts withall, to view That sweetest wonder; Pray'd for blessings too. His Suit and Coat (long that, large-shap'd to th' eye) Skies colour'd Sattin prov'd, rich glorious Die: Skirt, sides, and sleeves to th' Coat, broad-border'd round With dainty'st Fruits appear'd; choyce Silk for ground, Whose heights bright Silver, beamy Gold, t' express That Glistring Orchard of th' HESPERIDES; Or th' artfull Needles Summer-portraiture: Prime mystick work (by TYRIAN Youths) and pure. There shone th' impurpled Grape, Pomegranate, Cherry, Peach, Orange, Pear; with Plum, small Coran-berry: Though just on th' back, rich blazing Sun did seem To gild those Fruits, through smilings ripen'd them. Its Brest long-button'd down (for fashion, mould) With stretch'd-out Faulkons seem'd, of Silk and Gold, Beaks purest Silver, which thrust forth to Bill. Th' whole Suit with smaller trayls adorn'd, like skill Much richness shew'd; whose Buttons Pearls did wear. His Sattin Buskins lastly, o're-flown as 'twere With silver-streamed ounts, most sweetly shin'd: Two lowest Elements th' whole work design'd: Became that Person in compleatest sort; Though Blaz'd their truest Phoebus, he that wor't. Hers, fair green Sattin Robe; the lowest part Or Skirts whereof, most richly deck'd by Art With stately'st, loty trayls of growing Flow'rs; Silk, Silver, heightning Gold; thin pearly Show'rs Weeping on them from scatter'd Clouds above, Like Mays distilling Gems: There seem'd to rove
The loyt'ring Fly, that stout laborious Bee; How truely'st suck'd! whilst higher men might see Small winged Birds, choyce ayery generation. Those Flow'rs beneath seem'd part oth' first Creation, So primely fair; where th' glistring Lilly, Rose, Gillyflow'r, Tulip joyn'd, did seem disclose More Sun-born beauties far, more Radiant cheeks Then painted Garden beds (there sweetly pecks Small Pauney too) All which might Fragrant from That influentiall bodies Touch become, Like Natures brood: 'twas needless Springtide draught; By curious TYRIAN Virgins onely wrought; Whose Goddess CHLORIS crown'd might seem FLOS∣TEL. Her Sleeves did through Carnation Die excell; With gorgeous silver Calwork cover'd o're, As though Lights glistring Orbs▪ they (twin-like) bore: While th' purest Neck, with Dmons flaming higher, Limb'd forth that unknown Element of Fire. Lastly, Azure silken Vest, skarf-form'd to th' eye (Worn so) Star-pouder'd like Heav'ns Canopie, Boasted their Needles spark'ling Firmament: Those Flow's Earths under-glory might present: Which Mantles shoulder deck'd resplendent Moon, Though she chief Cinthia shin'd, which had it on: For (Reader) know what Garb soe're was worn, FLOSTELLA still did Braveness-self adorn. That tedious Noon-kept Triumph of the Tast, Their Dinner ore (most full, gaudy'st repast Would tire out Natures eating force, undo Strong'st appetite, cloy wanton fancy too) Rare Musick-strains, with Voyce-quires, banquetings; All strait for th' ample Park prepar'd, took wings For Hunting-sport: the Lord POLINDOR where, FLOSTELLAS self, with other Ladies there Brave mounted rod; most gallant view on Land. His Horse was white, by skilfull Nature stain'd
With blushing Spots; so glossie, shone, so cleer, That skin'd in Sattin all (when stroaked, neer Like-silken) appear'd; whose moving Nostrills, Eyes Bred ardent Flames, for shape all Rarities. Trod th' Ayr so mounting, proud, as if some One Oh' Suns wing'd Coursers were; dispos'd for none But th' Star bright milky Road: or (lastly) as knew His own and Riders matchless Beauty too (Both so exceling) whom the brave POLIND Best manag'd, Rul'd, as (skilfull) back'd the Wind: Horse, Man, (indeed) so joyntly motion'd showing, They prov'd as 'twere one Piece, together growing. Her's, lovely'st Dappl'd-gray, prime thing, for Beast All Delicacy seem'd (whom often prest That proud COMANDRA) his wavy Mane, unbound, Like Nymphs loos'd Morning-tresses, kiss'd the ground, How glass-bright fair, choyce, beauteous-limb'd, as it For Rose-bed onely; silken Couch were fit! Light-motion'd too, for th' heel, but shewing more Fine awfull Reverence, as conscious bore Some sacred Goddess; least its dainty'st Load Th' hard Earth should chance t' Offend, how nicely'st trod, With Sea-green Velvet-saddle was he deck'd, Wrought o're with Silver Waves, by art bespeck'd Like foaming Froath, where glistring Dolphins shone, Rich-skal'd as 'twere; both Dolphins, Waves thereon Moving, just as the wanton Palfry mov'. Her Stirrop, Bit, Guilt silver both approv'd. Next these, Skie colour'd Velvet Charret (late COMANDRAS glory, pride) Imbroider'd that To th' height, Purl fring'd, Six milk-white Horse atten∣ded Stag being run down, and those last Fun'rals ended With shrillest Horns, th' arch Hunts-man's tunefull Pal Rocks, Woods conjoyn'd in mournfull Ecchos still; Repast of various Chreams (that evening-hour By Masque like Silvans brought) long cover'd Bow
Replenish'd, mixt with Fruits and choycest Wines: Whilst from those lofty Tops more ayre-confines (Skulk'd 'mongst the boughs) cleer Cornets musick sound. Rare sportive Strains for th' eare; hils, woods rebound. Then pranced both with Duke ORTHERIS home Ith' Chariot, store oth' train Night-guests become. Their much too formall Supper being past, Nights Curtains spread, and all Spectators plac'd For artfull Banquet of the eare and eye, Set, Court-like Masque began; prime rarity; ANSELVIN's work; whose view through torches beams More heighten'd seem'd, with Ladies sparkling gems. MASQUE. Large Curtain drawn, these Sceans their art did boast: First, Wilderness, which shaken seem'd and tst Through stormy Hail; Banks, Rocks were hoary'd o're (Tru'st Clime of horrour found) Hobgoblings store Whence boystrous Antique danc'd; thereby exprest Wild Furies, troublers of the World: nor ceast, Till eter'd those, Winds, flashy Lightning, Thunder. That next did Calmest Prospect prove (to wonder) Two lovely'st Mounts, where verdant Laurels grew, Bays, proud victorious Palms; most beauteous View Of Honours Temple garnishing to th' One, Whilst on that other Virtues sweetly shone; Part-shaded both: betwixt those Mounts discry'd Smooth, slumbring Sea, Two Ships at anchor ride: 'Bout whom, th' whole Watry Surface glister seeming (With Rocks) through TITAN's Golden Blaze, rich beam∣ing Priest (lastly) from those Temples came, which bare This short Embassage to our Bridall Payr. That Six young Knights from pow'rful THRACIAN State, Sent to present the Lord POLINDOR late That Crown, as due from's royall Ancesters (Driven from thence by Fate of bloody Wars)
Six Ladies too, from fruitfull CIPRUS Land Imploy'd, with Crown at fair FLOSTELS command (Whose Right it was, PERSANDRAS Heir disclos'd) Their Barks through envious Furies, Storms oppos'd, Bright Honour, Virtues Temple yet (at last) Both Meeting gain'd; toyls, dangers overpast: Where wondring found that All were Agents sent To one Ioyn'd Princely Pair (most strange event As happy) now turn'd Fellow-servants prov'd: Which Nuptialls being heard, transported, mov'd Through th' fair example, those in Love united; Espousing too: would shortly Attend; Recited. When from those loftly'st Temples heav'nly Quire Of Priests appear'd, Rose-crown'd; to th' sweetest Lyr Sung forth choyce Epithalm, as one full Blessing On this grand Bridall, Those to boot expressing. The Song was thus. 1. Storms and Furies vanish'd prove, Heav'n hath those to Hell confounded; Lo, sweet'st-smiling Calm for Love, All's with Gales of Joy surrounded: Chirpers sing, Lovers, Flow'rs make double Spring, 2. One transcendent Sun-like Pair Hath produc'd six Pair of Lovers; Honour, virtues Buds they are, Each those Great ones Stamp dicovers: Thus, Divine Influential Pair does shine. All Delights Crown your Daies, your dearest Nights, Bessing sprung from Marryage-rites.
Here, Water-nymphs-(Founts from that Sea expressing) With wavy-stained Robes, purl'd Tinsell-dressing Danc'd stream-like forth; besprinkled round the Room With choyce Sweet-waters, Fragrant thence become. Third Scean and last Springs beauteous face assum'd, Banks drest with lovely'st Flow'rs, with Trees beplum'd; Bright Founts like Ropes of Pearl, those banks ore-straying, Or Chrystall Chains, Gems; danc'd (as 'twere) a Maying: Whilst chirping Birds, with various-tuned Noats, Heard, Chant it from those Wilder Champaign Grots. Ith' furthest end Delicious Arbour showing, God HYMEN's Bow'r, still Roie-fresh, new blowing: From whence their Masquers came, Six comely Payr; Carnation Sattin Robes, with Wreaths most fair (Flow'r-deck'd) like Lovers; Rich, bespangled trimming; Danc'd gracefull up, their formost Couple seeming Th' whole World for gallant Personage t' excell, Bate onely Two, POLINDOR and FLOSTEL: The Duke ORTHERIS Face whilst changing oft Looks, colour both; most various-passion'd Draught. Their Dance perform'd, All Faces turn'd to th' side, Where seated shone the Bridgroom and the Bride, Low-bowing all; when stait their middle-payr March slowly forth, and with Obaisance fair, Presented, rang'd their Crown at eithers feet, So back returning to their place: That sweet Harmonious Quire (mean-while) of Priestly fashion, Ioyn'd, warbled round their Twofold Coronation. The Song was thus. 1. Great and soveraign Pair for beauty, Virtue, as for Princely Birth, T' whom of duty Stoops all Excellence on earth; See what Fates reserve in store For you More.
2. These bright Crowns, joynt homage showing From Two faithfull Lands, embrace; Presents owing Your High worths as Royall race: With their Persons, each imparts Rule o're th' Hearts. Thus be twined Scepters like your Selves, combined; Nor be You, those Crowns, outshined. 'Twas rare, their Sences seemed to intrance; Song being cloz'd, All rouz'd for second Dance: Where choyce Sounds took their eare, there active ey Choyce Motion, Beauty, choycest Bravery. Dance likewise done, That Formost Couple strait Advanc'd to th' upper end, where fitly'st ate The Duke ORTHERE; Knee'd, crying, Our Lord and Father When, Startled he, ore-whelm'd confounded rather (Breath fail'd) cries, Who art thou com'st with that Name▪ And shape both, thus to torture me? I am, My Lord (sayd she) your Daughter Hah? my Daugh∣ter? (Sayd he agen) such once I had; When caught her By th' lovely'st trembling Hand (more grasping) neer, Least cheated with some Shade: Your Daughter (here Sayd she) DORISBE. Vanish'd Ghosts walk then (Sayd he) dead Corps she prov'd, when but Fifteen; Bury'd. Supposed dead, my Lord, inter'd (Sayd she again) but Heav'ns—What was't I heard (Sayd she) supposed dead? Am I awake? No doubt, my Lord, (sayd she) O do not take (Sayd he) th' Advantage of that comely'st Face, Voyce, gentle Girl, to swell my Griefs (alas) Make me more Wretch'd. When, weeping (o) soon after, Smiles mixt, Heav'n knowes (sayd she) I am your Daughter
Which truth affirm'd POLINDOR, standing by. When snatching her in's grasping armes, more nigh To th' panting heart, joyn'd kisses; Th' art (sayd he) My Girl, my lov'd DORISBE; very she; Th' art she indeed. When th' Lady kneeling new, And this my Spouse, my Lord (sayd she, to view Shewing THERSAMES) for which, though virtuous Prize, I beg your pardon. Th' hast it Daughter, rise (Sayd he) the Man seems worthy'st of esteem: Mean while, Spectators did transformed seem. When travers'd slowly up from Door oth' room A Lady, thinly'st Vayl'd, to proper whom Fine, gallant Pers'nage; Habit plain and neat; Best-carryag'd too; who drawing neer the seat, Clasping ORTHERIS round, in hast, cry'd out, My dearest Lord! when now, past jealous doubt 'Twas all but Dream, turn'd staring; Wo art thou (Sayd he again) com'st to torment me now? Voyc'd, shaped thus? I am (replyed she) Your Spouse and Wife. My wife? transformed he Reply'd in hast, all wonder) she agen, Your Wife KALASPE. How those Fates mock men To death (sayd he, strait gazing through her Hood) Hah? somewhat here disturbs my frantick blood (Went on) afflicts me; sure 'tis gen'rall Night Of Doom, dead waken round: Dear, dearest Spright, She was long since by th' Rock torn, batter'd, slain; I saw her mournfull Ghost. Sore bruised, tane For dead, my Lord, (sayd she) but Heav'ns supply'd— Go, th' art her lovelyer Ghost. (he suddain cry'd) And this, Ghosts Feild, that gloomy ELIZIUM: All's dead. No shade, my Lord (sayd she) become (Wept, throwing off her Vayl) Disown your poor Though true KALASPE, thus? strange broding hour Of Miracles! sayd he (soul-rapt, love-flaming) Caught, grasp'd her, kisses her; then strait exclaiming;
Nay now th'art she indeed, my best KALASPE! That Dying Hour's at hand (behold) last Gasp, And Heav'ns ordain through monstrous favour, I Must burst to Death in Ioyfull Extasie: Gods, ayde my Reason, least your Kindest load Ore-whelm, confound this frailer Flesh and blood. Here Mother, Daughter strait, most fondly flew Unto each others Brest, as rais'd anew From th' lowly Tomb; since deem'd each other Dead; Such postures, looks, that grand Ioy might be se'd Half-tac'd like Sorrow; tears, smiles, Med-ley-kind: Th' Heart so ore-fraught, ore-powr'd. Much joy'd Polind Then bowing came, and then th' All-sweet Flostel Embrac'd her, Mother own'd (whose Face t' excell Yet seem'd; choyce lovely'st wonder, were't not by That young unequall'd Pair) their gen'rall Eye Acting the Silent rest, full Passion flowes In sobrest Weeping round, for pause and cloze. Whilst some Spectators thought their former show No Masque, but Dream or Vision, ending so. Th' ore-rapt ORTHERIS, here, could scarce believe He Waked yet, till both their Story give; What wondrous waies obtain'd this Mystick Blessing; Those briefly'st each (then growing late) expressing: Though in DORISBES story were conceal'd Some cautious truths, Truth though, what e're reveal'd: Whose fuller Map we shall hold forth to view; Though Both of them wrapt up most briefly too. First for KALASPES short, though various Fate, Who was thrown down that dismall Rock, through hate Of vile LURGANOR (as long since was told) By Huntesmen scar'd, when (lo) that uncontrol'd, High'st Providence so check'd the threatning stroke That, leavy Branch, grown forth 'bout 'midst oth'Rock, Imbrac'd her dainty'st Limbs; did gently so Dandle them down to th sprouting Branch, below,
Which kindly'st Kiss'd them too: Though cruell Crag Oth' Rock, receiving next, might adly brag Of purest Blood; which rudely'st arm'd did throw'er. For second heavy'st Greeting, down much lower To th'Champaign-ground: where Lump of senceless Clay (Though fair to boot) Blood-purpled, bruis'd she lay. Chief Lord oth' Hunting Train (as hap'ly chanc'd) Came strait-waies Riding by, with Pitty glanc'd On th' mournfull Object; Pers'nage there espy'd Pure-form'd, rich-jewel'd, gorgeous-cloath'd (beside) Which spoke her Noblest rank'd; nor fully yet Dispairing Life, convey'd that Corps so sweet By gentlest Litter to his worthy Friend's (Some half-mile off) whom for important ends Late visited, his honou'd nightly uest. And, being known Himself most learned Brest, Choyce-skil'd as well as noble (through th' All wise Conjoyn'd, All-pow'rfull Surgeon of the Skies) Caus'd Motion in short time, and next (ere long) Rouz'd partly Sence; yea, faint Life-spirits sprung, Small vigour in som few propitios daies: Though still so low, weak voyc'd, weak-brain'd (alas) She could not least make known her self; nor came Least Noyse so far enquiry of such a Dame. When, being summon'd Home through weighty Affairs; Mind sadly loth to leave her there to Stars Most doubtfull, since Iunes warmer ayre could brook (As then) short way, soft Litters Couch, he took Her Person along with him, whose Roof could boast The worlds prime rarest Surgeon (whence ingrost His Skill) though crazy grown, too old to ride: Had bound himself by suddain Vow, beside, Never to pass beyond that watry Bay (Seas branch some three miles broad) which, being their∣way They smoothly crost: now ne're t' embrace the Shore: When Pirats seis'd their Bark; to melt, implore

Thus, all of them soon reach'd the TYRIAN shore (Full-sayl'd) Full-booty'd too) strait turning o're Their severall Pris'ners, sold for Slaves about Like Market-beasts (indeed) unhappy rout! KALASPE though was nicely'st kept at Home (Choyce-Pearl) till healthfull'st, lovely'st grown; o're∣come Through whose sweet-pleading Tears (at length, as favor) To th'TYRIAN Queen, rewarded though, he gave her; Who lov'd much Graecians, beauty much extol'd, Ere long as Chief' mongst all her Train inrol'd. Thus liv'd she Favour'd there, most lov'd, admir'd For four years space; though Pensive, sad; o're-tir'd (Indeed) through eager, Courtly Suitors still: ORTHERIS though concluded Dead (worst ill!) Seen fouly Mangled, Falling, Prostrate lye: Till Merchant-friend of hers, from ARCADY (Who chanc'd to spy her out) at Court arriving Inform'd her that ORTHERIS still was living; Live-bury'd though through Grief; DORISBE turn'd Long since a Ghost, whom she most truely mourn'd. Thus, longing now for th' worthy'st Husband, Home (Whose Lady-queen, Deaths Bond-mayd then become, Fully free'd her) that Merchant ship'd her hither; Last, to SARMARA brought (neer hand) where either Weary'd Repos'd, till, noys'd POINDOR'S Feast, Thus stole she up, unknown intruding Guest.
As for that vile' LURGANOR, with's belov'd Damn'd rout, by Sea fit sops for Whales they prov'd. Next, fair DORISBES wondrous Fortune view; Whose Mother being surpris'd by th' rambling Crew (As hard) her Father too most sad-confin'd To's pleasant Lodge; gor'd both in body, mind; She strait to th' Countess, her great-Lady Aunt (Chief Town, SARMARA) came; might justly vaunt Then 'bout Fifteen ripe Beauty most excelling; Most sweet: sweet'st Nature also paralelling. Her Aunt and she (month after) on sollemn day Gracing JOVE'S Temple both, as then, to pay Publick devotions there; her Gallant Spouse Most brave THERSAMES saw her, humbly bows T' Imperiall Love: that JOVE-spous'd Deity She seem'd alone, great'st JUNO from on high Come down, to whom all Hearts due sacrifice. Whom view'd with what most dear regards! discries What speaking Flames (as 'twere) of honour, love, Soul-pantings there! since Souls do clearly move Ith' eyes bright splendid Orbs, and th' under-cheek: Looks sued vow'd; Looks Burned thence, as quick Froze too, when th' Blood retir'd from face to th' Heart, Which Wooing gestures, being on her part Fully observ'd, whilst Gaz'd the rest (his prime Accomplish'd Form, rich courtly Garb) betime Were answer'd back by th' Lady thus, so rare, Fine, modest Sweetness shone, that thence Dispair Might well seem check'd; though check'd Presumption (too; Th' hallow'd Rites done, THERSAMES needs must (view His radiant Mrning-star to th' very Set; Trac'd her to th' door, some cautious distance yet; Where seeming Blind, as then h'had lost Day-light, Soul both with her, there sally'd forth in fight Spruce, middle-ag'd Physick-doctor, nam'd FORENZ: Old Friend of his, first by his Grandsires means
Brought up from Clouts, maintain'd of Almes; preferr'd By's Father too, to whom long since appear'd Owing for's Life; choyce Doctor thought, esteem'd By th' Countess aunt, whose constant Lodger seem'd: Her Girl his Patient then, Darling belov'd. Whom marching fitly'st by, as prompted, mov'd By pow'rfull Fato, THERSAMES gladly embrac'd (Th' whole thing by th' Lady spy'd by chance, who cast Glance from above) strait drew him roundly on To by-nook, cloyster'd Place; where both alone, Inquir'd of him who that Young Lady was. FORENZ inform'd him strait, ith' second place Whoh' Guardian-aunt. THERSAMES strongly pray'd, That, priviledge through his procurement, ayde, Entring, he might salute that Soveraign part Of Natures wonder, breathing forth his heart By th' Tongue, as Blaz'a it lately by his Eyes. FORENZ, grown pensive, sad, wish'd him be wise; New-minds him of her great'st illustrious Birth, Huge, dazeling Fortunes too; her Aunt th' whole earth Not match'd for towring'st mind, almost, beside Known loftly'st Aymes for her: Inform'd, what Tide O Big-rank'd Suitors there, though mention'd one Grand, mighty Lord, most urg'd by th' Aunt alone (Whom yet conceiv'd she loath'd) for damping cloze, How strictly austere her Aunt; Mayds, Daughters, those Stil Scout-like following her: no way did seem T' obtain the Prize, but by strange Stratagem. THERSAMES when reply'd; O, dearest Friend Support me, or I sink ingulph'd; but lend Your  ayde; in Losing her I'm wholly Lost, Whose Reason, Life (dear Sir) Bound up in her become: O make me able To grasp, Enjoy, or know I'm miserable.

Connex'd to boot; Intreats him pause that Even, Self-conquest practise, try; by th' hour of Seaven Next Morn (howere) he'd wait on him again. Home goes FORENZ with shrewdly puzzl'd brain, Sadly task'd thoughts, should this Love-fit endure, By what safe Means both sturdy Work and Cure T' effect at once, prime Cordiall since fruition: First ground-work though in this Abstruse condition, The Ladies conquest seem'd, her Love ' ore-come; Fair hopes whereof, that choycest Natures Bloom, Her sweetest Goodness: next, most gallant Shape, Of young THERSAME, Court-garb (whilst seem'd as Rape To loath that rude-form'd Lords, embrace) severe, Strict, sowrest Aunt: Her friendly'st aspect there Regard tow'rds him, whose Patient, when arriv'd There first, became; Sick-grown through un-repriev'd Dear Mothers loss, weak' Father's body, mind: Though, won her Love, dark cloudy'st Maze behind: Since guarded so, to th' secret Closset even, Least (Praying) thence should flutter up to Heaven, Dndl'd twixt some enamour'd Angel's armes; How to convey her thence, no Magick, charms. Sore mused he that visits debt next Morn Discharg'd, perform'd, he finds in Bed forlorn, Perplext THERSAMES; Stormy-soul'd; his Blood Turn'd feaverish, strange, dolefull'st Lovers mood: Crying, O FORENZ, support; redeem me from Loves earthly Hell, this burning friezing Doom. When, grasping him in's armes, through-pierc'd FO∣RENZ Cry'd; cheer up boldly, worthy'st Youth, from hence ind me th' Oar'd Slave to serve thy Loving passion; Though sunk my Life ith' boysterous Navigation: id rise, and rouse withall his Amorous brains, Write unto her in th' most endearing Strains , Love; that Temples place express here view'd her first, what Bodies cloaths, Souls dress

THERSAMES pen'd his worthy'st Thoughts, as writ In ardent Flames for Ink, high'st Passion, Wit; So purely harmonious Sounds, so Musicall Love-stile (indeed) 'twould Savage-brest inthrall: How limb'd his Passions forth, her heav'nly Beauty! Th' Heart sent inclos'd as Sacrifice of duty. FORENZ, returning back, joyn'd underneath Much also, shewn his Friend; as pow'rfull Wreath To crown belief: Wherein his Pen conjur'd Her strongest Faith to all he wrote; Assur'd First of's gentilest Birth (though highly'st rays'd Their Ancestors) his Ports, good Nature blaz'd (Known to him from the Womb) his Full and free Estate to boot, discover'd punctually: Love last confirm'd, whose Agonies discry'd; Breathing through Hope, else sure the Youth had dy`d; Gods th' awfull Witness then Invoak'd to all, Whose Pow'rs he feard, ador'd. But least befall Nice doubts oth' Party ought, he Beg'd thus far, That she'd next Morn, in person grace Be-star Some Window; Ten conceiv'd most vacant Hour; When, in such former Cloaths, that gallant Flow'r Of Youth should pass by, fixed Hand oth' brest. Whom if she would with Favour crown, make Blest By secret Flight, as both should safely Ordain; Then beg'd, beseech'd, next Morn to that again ('Bout Ten) plac'd neer her sickly'st Consius Bed, Walls darker side (as us'd) he entered, She'd stroak (for sign) with gentlest Hand her eye; Then thrust ith' Bosome strait; drawing more nigh, Take lower under's Cloak (by nimble slight) Small Glass from's wary reach'd-out Hand, but light; Cas'd round with Paper all, which strait convay T'her faithfull'st Cabinet from th' eyes of Dy.
Though sadly'st su'd, if Doom'd beyond repeal This worthy'st Youth for Death, she'd these conceal. FORENZ, love-furnish'd thus, about eleven Enter'd his Patients room, where bounteous Heaven Had set DORISBE, being newly'st come (As Kindly us'd) walls darker side; on whom Most wistly Glancing, whilst she sweetly Blush'd (Prepar'd for some Design) he softlier push'd Into her gentle hand (quick'st under-slight) That Paper which the Lady took: from sight Wrapt up, as though fore-warn'd oth' Amorous plot: T'her Closets councel-board, ere long, she got (Mayd-following) and, clos'd her Door, began With new-blown Roses there (alas, too plain) To read her Lines; when shortly Milky'st white Seem'd t' over-flow those beds of Roses quite, Sweet'st-pale. She read (choyce scroul with love Begem'd, Word-pearls) th' eyes Gilding it, how oft! though stream'd No doubt at all, who th' Lovesick Person was, Yet, mildly'st ere Tens hour, the Windows glass She pleas'd t' Adorn; through which, being Chrystal∣line, Full-view'd, did like to th' fair AURORA shine Through th' eastern Casements; standing reading there, Neer large broke Pane (which seem'd Complyance bear) Maid working by. Th' approv'd THERSAMES came; Most Sun-like pers'nage, cloathed all in Flame, Gold, beauty, love; his Goddess soon espies, Whom (undiscern'd) ador'd, with fixed eyes On her, then Heav'n; his Hand across the brest: So, passing slowly on, such looks at least, Mild Sweetness from those Window-clouds, distilling, As blaz'd her forth no Tigre brood, nor killing. Sight being past, much more this second day The sweet DORISBE Mus'd, does sober weigh All things; besides that soul offensive Lord, Tart, strictest Aunt, her Servant seemed stor'd

To her own Fancies wish; unmatch'd: the Face Body (indeed Compound Enamouring. His Love last heighten'd all, whose noblest Spring Sublime and High, since beg'd her Self alone. These weigh'd, she Sigh'd; when, wondring at that one, Sigh'd three times o're: perceiv'd too plainly there That she was growing now Unself'd (as 'twere) Non-hearted, thrall'd; giv'n up unto Another; Which strange surmounting Fits, whilst strove to smoth Saucy't encreas'd; more Mus'd, the more she Lov'd: Th' own Heart (alas) since kind Revoltress prov'd, For absent, poor THERSAMES strongly pleading, Thus, sick through Fancy▪ qualms, this new Love breed∣ing She yeilded her self up, for govern'd by Great Love, well-known FORENZ, and Destiny. Next prosperous Morn, at th' hour and place requird, She gave to joy'd FORENZ (as wish'd, desir'd) Those dear sweet Signs; drawing neer, with gentlest H Receiv'd that mention'd Glass; which, closely gain'd, Conceald some while, to th' Closset lightly trip'd (Mayd following) spring-lock'd her door, unstrip'd That precious Glass; found Paper-cased o're; Wherein FORENZ did strongly'st thus implore. As first, that she would trust more boldly, Su'd, Heav'n and his faithfull Care, resolve, conclude For secret Flight; sought stoln embrace alone; Which should such Wonderous easie Waies be done, Sure, safe (as he'd next Morn by lines discover, Giv'n neer her Cousins Bed, Plot strangely above'er) Th'whole World should nere pursue, their Joyes debar: THERSAMES goodly'st Seat, Estate as far (Resides) remov'd, as reach'd th' ARCADIAN Bound. Meanwhile, beseech'd her drink that most renownd
Choyce Cordiall sent, th' Worlds onely Soveraign; 'Twould mint new Spirits, steel both Heart and Brain For th' crown'd Exploit at hand (some's meaner Pow'r Sh'had try'd, approv'd) but beg'd t' observe her Hour: Eight next Morn, by her Watch, th' attendant Mayd Sent down for Drink, then step to th' Closet (prayd) Close by her, toss it off: the empty Glass Thrown forth at Window, strait amonst the grass (Wild Plot beneath) whereby confirmed, lo, That she had drunk't, he'd watchfull Seize it so (Least spy'd, that Glass bred thoughts of some combining) So strait to th' naked Bed her self resigning: 'Twould suddain short refreshing Slumber breed: Though beg'd, conjur'd, as lov'd their Lives (indeed) Those Papers both should over night be burn'd; Their Plot thence being Entomb'd, to cinders turn'd. 'Twas thus far Manag'd well, faint hope t' invight; Next, young THERSAMES Heart he cheer'd (as right) Him Cordialliz'd; who seemed to endure Strange bandyes betwixt Heav'n and Hell; procure Two large false Beards enjoyned him anon, Till's utmost Lovers Task be shortly known. Next following Morn by eight, the rarely sweet DORISBE (every point perform'd as meet) Mayd being sent down for Drink, and th'hidden Gloves, Carous'd her Potion off; then nimbly moves To th' Bed again; where, warmly couch'd, ere long Cold frozen Vapours seem'd at once to throng Her sadly ore-clouded Brain, benum'd, congeal'd: Limbs stretch'd, Sence stifled, gone whilst clozing seald Black, dismall Night those Iewels of her eyes; Some softer groans; O death (no more) she cryes: Stiff, pale, like Death's more pure-complexion'd Queen: Dire Cordiall; dolefull'st Slumber ere was seen. The Mayd returning now, less quick of foot, With suddain start, and loud out-cryes to boot,
Call'd up her Countess-Aunt; the Doctor then (Sweet'st, lovely'st Corps beheld, choyce Picture, Scean Of humane fraylty) when the damp'd FORENZ Grown pensive, sad, startling (th' Head turned thence, Brest struck withall) cry'd, Fearfull'st Symtomes show'd 'Twas that new killing Pestilence, which trod With suddain Death; advis'd her Aunt (howere) She should till ten at Night lye couched there, Shrouded alone, which would Resolve how strong That Band of Death; though then affirm'd 'twere Wrong To th' Living, not to Coffin her, Inter: Because that inward Venome, lodg'd in her, Would Fume-like breath forth by that hour, exhale: Which th' Aunt approv'd, scarce seen to melt, bewail (Stout, frosty-temper'd brest) though worthy'st Neice Might claim all Tears, th' whole Fun'rall-tide of Greece. And thus, ere long, the sweetly delicate (Though corps) DORISBE shrouded was, Death's mae; Whose Shrouding-cloath beneath her Chin did pass (Such th' use) broad Bongrace onely o're her Face Shelving, as slept: her Head most Nightly drest.

Her Corps ordained then, for th' neighbouring Brook (Dainty'st Fish-food) though Molten Chrystall Tomb, Still Weeping o're her bones, 'twould thus become.

Go forth, return, 'bout Life and Deaths Affairs. Door being ope, he whistled strait, then stares Upon that neighbouring Cops with forged Beard; When forth the rous'd THERZAMES strait appear'd With's Coffin all disguis'd, and forward pac'd To th' Garden-door; from whence most softly trac'd Behind his leading Chief (FORENZ as trod Some dismall Maze of death) to th' sad Aboe Oth' dead, the Vault; strait gazing wildly round, Where sweet'st, belov'd DORISBE might be found: Ghost nigh become. So, nimbly, down with that (Low cry'd FORENZ) and help to take up strait Your Mistress; pointing forth to th' Coffin then: Ay-me! forlorn!

Ah sweetest, dearest Soul (Sayd he) my jealous Boading Heart! Controul Those fonder thoughts (the stout FORENZ reply'd) Away with her. Thus, hoys'd by eithers side Their new false Coffin's born (the Garden-door Soft closed, lock'd) their Cloaks thrown spreading o're

Good heaven's (cry'd out FORENZ) we're mock'd, abus'd; Here lies DORISBE. Fates and death! (Soul-bruis'd THERSAMES cry'd) alas! and is this she? Dear, truest Corps now, butcher'd, slain! sayd he; Grasp'd, kissed her. No, no she breaths, she lives (Sayd next FORENZ, though strangely Amaz'd, misgives Whilst th' honest Heart) 'tis onely deeper Trance I cast her in; be cheer'd: with eagrest glance Scouting th' whole body round, though then espy'd Nor wound, nor seeming bruise: at last descry'd Those Rings; skin rippl'd 'bout them, broke: Behold Griev'd Youth (sayd he) those tempting Gems and Gold That caus'd this grand Delusion; quick, convay Her body hence: whilst he; Dear, dearest clay, I shall not long survive thy Sweetness (cry'd) Nor mine own Joy.

With faith confide In Heav'n and Art (said rarely'st skil'd FORENZ) She seeps alone; by Three, thy greedy Sence Please with DORISBE and all her charming Graces. O Heavens (said he again) what Rack surpasses My torturing fears? so long? that needs not neither (Reply'd FORENZ) this cold Frost, cloudy weather, Deaths fog, my Art much sooner can dispell; So, clear th' all-fair, all-lovely Clime. From Hell O then redeem poor me (THERSAMES cry'd) As her from rapefull Death; whose Darling, pride Long since become: scarce, scarcely he'l let her go. Here powerfull'st Unguents, cordialls strait did show Th' admir'd FORENZ; how bath'd her Temples, Breast! Rub'd, chaf'd, her then: Nor loyt'ring prov'd the least THERSAMES, labouring for second Life (Stoln mournfull Kisses oft) 'twas eager strife Which should exceed: Till now, some half an hour Thus spent, dissolv'd; their Seat each living Pow'r (Awak'd) resum'd; she moving, warm became; Both Cheeks and Lips thin-blossom'd o're: All Flame THERSAMES when, she lives, she lives (he cry'd) She moves; all Beauty, Virtue else had dy'd With my Heart also: grasp'd her, Kisses then Snatching such ravenous-wise (true Lovers Scean) As though would that Life's sweet'st Advantage take (Dear, dearest Flash) least soon the Corps forsake: Or, fear'd her Modesty, would thus improve That living Dream for's hunger-starved Love: Kisses (indeed) whose kindest Larum more Might waken at that sweetest Rubie-dore.

Most certain truth, to th' full: Answer'd FORENZ. Sweet Madam, let not that Displease you (joyn'd low-bowing THERSAES strait) Loves over-sawcy Crime. It doth not, Sir (Sayd she) but yet the Manner how does stir My Souls amazement. Madam, you were drown'd In deepest Trance, by th' potion (sayd profound

Bless me (sayd she) and was I Voted, thought Dead corps (nigh fainting) Coffin'd too? ith' Vault Dolefull inter'd? My lifes dear Life you were THERSAMES sayd. Dead, or alive, whatere Methought (sayd she) those Feilds, that gloomy Wood I trac'd, where wander'd thinnest Ghosts; 'twas good You Vayl'd your dismall Project so from th' eye, Scarce had I ventur'd on't. Nor truly ad I, Best Lady, least inform'd (THERSAMES se'd) Expos'd you thus; though through Dispairing dead. Come simple Punees (cry'd the unmatch'd FORENZ) Y' are both in Natures Schools; by powerfull means Of this Device, you now may follow Home This brave Youth to his country, travail, roam (If please) th' whole World, since marshall'd 'mongst the Dead, My Self too safe, secure, unquestioned. When sweetly'st she, with blushing smile displayd Down-glance, The Gods indeed have Both convay'd Strangely'st together thus (th' All-powerfull, Wise) What ever else their joyn'd Divinities Have fix'd, Ordaind? 'Tis in your soveraign Pow'r Dear gentlest Madam (cry'd THERSAME) this hour Next Voyce of Heav'n, to cloze up all for me In blessedness. When, sweetly'st breathing she Again, Since Heav'ns and You have manag'd it Thus far (stupendious Work ineed) thought fit, I yeild, resignme.

When, richly'st blushing she, You cannot blame (I hope) my Modestie.
Mean while (went on) Your selves since forc'd to thes Strange naked Pastures. On our humble Knees Best Madam (cry'd THERSAMES) we should rather Implore your pardon for't. As Beard-grown Father To both (sayd then FORENZ) Come, come despis Such squamish Toyes, poor simple Niceties 'Twixt Love-conjoyned brests; whom for a space I now must leave intwin'd: sore words: Alas! And will you leave me thus then? (strait reply'd DORISBE drooping, sad. L, there's (he cryd) Your worthy'st Guardian, one that dares no wrong, Will prie your Person; Fame (believe't) among Things sacred: trust that noblest Character I wrote of him. When strait-petition'd her THERSAMES too, for gracious Confidence For why, that Night (howere) ain would FORENZ Be thought within; Key left ith' postern found; From whence to's Chamber close and shaded ground: Should early too, next morn, some physicall Receits to th' young sick Cousin give withall. By Seav'n he would not fayl t' attend her there, When they'd provide for needful'st things to wear: Priest last should be procur'd, for joyning fit. Mean while with what Delights, how various sweet Kisses discourse, th' enamour'd Youthfull Pair Melted those Sugred hours! things new and rare, Dainties as yet to both! much more Sublim'd Through past fears, tortures, jalousies (though prim'd Love-sweets become, when with both Armes and Lip Th' Heart moves, kind sympathising temper keeps, United Soules when seem't embrace and kiss) All modest, chast: Nights gentle shades their bliss First (conscious) shrouding; then, the fainter Dawn Peep'd glimmering Witness through, till Charret-drawn Forth rod the golden Day; through sundry choyce Of Seasons variating more their Ioyes:
Whilst hug'd THERSAMES thus (transported, 'prov'd) Some Angell in death-smock; or Buriall-shroud: Strange, mistick-fine possession of her there Giv'n in's own Bed, from courteous Fate as 'twere. His Man (besides) ith' Country then to view Some neerest Friends; thus, nought oth' Coffin knew. By sev'n return'd FORENZ, when 'twas agreed, THERSAMES (since less known) should bring wth speed Some Silk-Gowns ready made, for th' present use; With Linnen; all things needfull else, and Spruce: Which task how gladly embrac'd! in no long time Brought Choyce of all: one fit-siz'd Gown, the prime DORISBE chose; unseen, though view'd them there Ith' Bed-chamber, nor would FORENZ appear. Thus, being Bride-like drest, ere long their hands Priest-closely link'd in Hymenean Bands; The Lady veyl'd; THERSAMES with FORENZ Disguis'd in those false Beards: less danger thence. Next blisfull Night was payd ith' Garden-bow'r Wedding-joyes totall Sum, loves Golden▪ show'r: Dear, sweet'st DORISBE now (contemning harms) New-tranc'd and bury'd in her Lovers armes. Those Coffins blaz'd themselves with Fun'rall fire. Short time she stayd in Town for cloathes, attire; Till, furnish'd like THERSAMES Wife, FORENZ Saw them SARMARA leave; new-coach'd from thence: Though breath'd both sides in Tears their last Farwell. Thus did this Lady honour'd, happy dwell Far off, remote (most plenteous too) till dead Her Countess-Aunt, SARMARA visited Neer-hand: was to her Brother late unclouded; Made known; though from ORTHERIS fitly shrouded. Though Both did thus their Story rayse, advance For best to th' view; That, through Lethargick Trance (Thought that new Pestilence) with hast inter'd, That Villain stole her thence, most likely (as heard)
Imploy'd t' obtain those Gems; till, passing by THERSAMES, nimbly'st fled: Who painfully (Judging her Noblest-rank'd, perhaps not dead But Tranc'd, signes found) convey'd her to his Bed; Ere long through's care Restor'd: whose earnest Love, Known generall worth, did Marriage-motives prove; For Life too (strongest Scoar) most dearly engaged: Though known, her Father thence might turn enraged. This ended, from the side spruce comly Pair March'd slowly forth, whose Hands conjoyned are; Most cheerfull-ey'd, fresh-cheek'd to boot; so fine Their Habit, Garb, some Bridall thence did shine; FORENZ, ARDIAN these indeed (Belov'd Nurse to FLOSTEL) whom, Widow then, approv'd Still handsome youthfull Piece; Neat-fashion'd, bred Money'd, rich-farm'd for life (neer gains Well-head SARMARA Town) the Doctor stoutly woo'd; Soon won, ore-came: though secret Wedding show'd; For which Offence FLOSTELLAS pardon there Both humbly ask'd: who (sparkling Smiles howe're) Wish'd them chief Marriage-joy; 'twas sport become, New Masque of jolly mirth, to all the Room. Th' ore-joy'd THERSAMES and DORISBE though Most gladly embraced him, t' whom speaking low, Thus sayd FORENZ; I hope you passed by My Potions part, ith' late strange History, As 'twas resolv'd, agre'd: They told him, Yes; 'Twas wisely done: thus ended all in bliss, Short running Banquet though, for sweeter cloze; When all withdrew, sought Natures calm repose: Though second Wedding-night that prov'd as 'twere (Loves joyes reviv'd) to th' late forlorn ORTHERE. (Thus (Reader) from these Towry heights we view Spread Cottage-plains, with Pastorall troops, anew; Those two gentile-born Nymphs, DULCENZA fair MARPESA, in chief; to whom (kind noblest care)

Two severall Wedding daies they chose, design'd; Each celebrating thus that others Feast, Kind Partners in't; both happy Wives and blest. All which, their Parents too, as first they were (Most part) Ioynt-sufferers with Duke ORTHERE;

And now FLOSTELLAS House was free'd from guests, Wedding-coyl, business o're; those Masquings, Feasts, Gay costly triumphs; Progress time become: Th' ore-joy'd ORTHERIS now his ancient Home, With's dear New-liv'd KALASPE, long'd to view (Since growing Friends, part-reconcil'd anew To th' gentler-visag'd World) that stately Seat, Where next to his own King (indeed) most great, Powerfull, transcendent liv'd, for fourteen year (Though prov'd the Court his constant glistring Spear) 'Twas Place, for all respects, magnificent, Prince-like esteem'd (th' House, Gardens, Large extent Of Lordship, Park adjoyn'd) became his might; First, greatest Peer, next, greatest Favourite. Thither the Duke, with all that Courtly train Joyfull arriv'd; where viewed o're again Like pompous Scean, with like triumphant Feast, For sweet DORISBES Nuptiall sake exprest. His own Feast too, more providentiall fashion, Happen'd just then; whose gladsome Celebration With yearly Zeal was still perform'd, and now Wore sumptuous Plenties on its smiling brow: Sack flowing there, rich Fount his Conduits womb, Whence Streamed forth th' old FALERN Grate, become. Before, and since those Storms disastrous blew, The world more constant Couple never new; Though Pattern equaliz'd it was, to th' full, By both those younger Payrs; love-miracle. Huge mounting Portion then to's Son, the brave THERSAMES, with belov'd DORISBE he gave▪
Though present fair Estate, to boot, with one Prime gallant House, the Lod POLINDOR's grown. Just when POLINDOR's Feast, gave up Life-breath That wild young King, mere surffetted to death: Whose humerous Folly sensuall Lut the Realm Five years (alas) did sadly'st Cloud, ore-whelm. When's Vncle seiz'd the Crown to th' Duke ORTHER Kind Friend, as was his Royall brother, ere; Confirming strait to him his Ancient pow'r, Who humbly Waved all that very hour; Grown since withdrawn, retir'd (howere, for place First-rank'd ARCADIAN Peer, as for wealths blaze, Honour'd, belov'd to boot) Self-conquering Mind More strange, POLINDOR though great heights declin'd: Convinc'd by's Father's change of late, how bowing Those lofty Spires; FLOSTELLAS self allowing: Yet was made Duke in her dead Fathers room, ARPLAST; THERSAMES too new Lord become; Whose owne Inheritance, conjoyn'd to that Grand portion giv'n, made up good Lords Estate. And now at length, the lovely'st Bride was woo'd T' her Husbands new brave Mansion, thither rod; Harmonious-joyning guests with whom did go Th' whole Troop; no Churls FORENZ, ARDINA too (Though th' Parents left behind) whose pompous Gat Now drawing neer, POLINDOR (as did wait To quit kind former Scoars) with sobrest Kiss Her Mistress made of all, entitled his. 'Twas needfull time House-warmings there began, Whose goodly'st-modell'd Structure th' art of Man▪ Prospective seat the skill of Nature vaunted; Fine Gardens, joyning Park, Groves rarely planted: 'Twixt these their Mansion-bow'rs divided were Those twofold various Seasons of the Year. POLINDOR Rul'd without; hearts soveraign Queen So wish'd, desir'd; whilst Mistress she's within
He'd have it so: and Mistress without door In what might raie, advance, her Pleasure more: So, crossing least her self, she crossed him. Thus, both their powerfull little World did seem To share, as those grand Heaven-luminaries Rule night and day; two still but one Soul marries: Both, like to Twins (as 'twere) incorporated, Going one way, whatever lov'd or hated: So like prov'd their Affections, Eccho, Shades T' one seem'd to th' other still; one Pulse they had. As when some Musick-string you sounding touch, Another, Eight to that, will tremble much Through rare, kind, Sympathizing force; ev'n so Their Turtle-brests like secret pantings show: One stock of joy and grief, as of estate, Serv'd both; t' ones ye seem'd Glass oth' others fate. And if least differing Mind, those thoughts were either Veyl'd, gently hid; or Wisdome, Love together Soon strook conjoyning Cloze: as, when trench made, One wandring Stream does speedily invade Anothers channel-road; till mingled, Lost: Thus, seem'd their strife but Dandling ball at most. So good, Both, so discreet (intruth) appearing, That, who e're Yields, small danger of much Erring. Scarce parted they, and parted then no longer, Then serious Buisness, sports, made Passion stronger; Rays'd, quicken'd Appetite; through daintier Kisses Endearing ove-delights sometimes, love-blisses. 'Midst all their store as choycest Crown and Gem Viewing each other stll, whereby did seem (Whilst Moon-like moving in their sev'ral Sphear) As each the others PHoeBUS, dear Sun were; From whence its borrow'd light and comfort darted; In whose armes Circle shew'd all joyes imparted: Where sweetli'st snatch'd from their own Selves surpriz'd To pleasing Extasies, imparadiz'd▪
Lo, Virtue, Love, which blazon'd worthy'st be Star-coat of armes; Skie-mounted heraldry. For close of all; fair Monumentall Shrine Over that Dust of noblest ASTORIN POLINDOR thankfull rays'd; Inscrib'd above These words; Devote to true unhappy Love. His dainty'st bowry Green, and blisfull Cave To's good old Host, oth' Town TREGOR, he gave. His Fathers Grange on him confer'd, to those His neighbouring Swains was left, at full dispose; VVho yearly Feasted there, sung forth to Fame Renown'd POLINDOR and FLOSTELLAS Name.

POEMS. THE AUTHORS First DREAM of FLOSTELLA, Seen in a Winters Morning, as he rode on Hunting. WEnt I this Morn, in cruell sport, To fright the poor Hare from her Fort? Up-rouze her from the solemn Cell With horrors of a Fun'all-knell? Did Tyrant-I seek others Prize? My self now made the Sacrifice? Fates, you are equall, and thou Love; Like mercy I (just Talio) prove As meant to others; Torture, Pain; Dire Scourge! 'tis my reward again. 'Twas She my Huntres was, by th' way, That ayr'd her so, like Princess May; Such sweets and beauties scattring round, Dull Winter seem'd turn'd jolly, Crown'd With Rose-buds, fragrant breath'd. What Rayes Then strook our eyes! what wonders blaze, Sweet'st Lightnings! O, what Charms divine! Th' ore-coming Glory did define Some Angel-Form; if Earthly race, Then Woman, lovely'st woman, 'twas; Or rare I know not what: she's All We Men admire, perfection call.
Her Looks shot day-light, Beame-supplyes, While th' sun (cloud muffled scout) close lyes; Asham'd on's gaudier blasing so, Those Copper-rayes to hers in shew: Perhaps, some Love-dart fear'd, least he By th' jealous Morne forsaken be; Or, indeed struck, with amorous head Iog'd on, and so went sick to Bed: The world not needing beg th' old Sun, Since from her eyes flm'd Two for one, No Christall frost worke dek'd the ground T'intice her foot, whose Beamings round That Morne disperst, perhaps ore-aw'd The glaz'd Earth, Congelations thawd. Her pace Court-measure, gratefull'st showd; Whilst through her Breath, th' Aire, spicy, good, Purg'd wholsome seem'd: as Goblis light, Fogs shun her Purity, take flight. Ten thousand Cupids came along, Playing in her eyes, her cheeks, or hung Oth' Brest, Lips, Hayr; incamp'd appeare, In Bright and loveli'st Musters, there, As with their quiver'd Hoast would peirce All Hearts, and conquer th' Vniverse: A moving world of wonder shewing; Heaven of flesh all Ioyes bestowing. Twas fairely-sweetly-cruell , That chas'd and seiz'd my liberty; That let whole Mint of lightnings fly, Heap of Granadoes from her Eye, Dart-magazine, that shot through mine; I saw their flaming points to shine All th' way they came, when, through the Eye, Th' heart bled in kindest sympathy: I hop'd, fear'd, mus'd (Non-self'd, confesse) Strange Seeing Road! what wonders presse Through th' eyes glaz'd Organs, Souls possess!
On FLOSTELLAS Close Nun-like Retirement. WHy seemes (Sun cloath'd Flostel) so long Deferd our Break of day, till stung With Greenland curse? O Why (Mole fashion) Pore wee on Clods, this dull Creation, Our glory hid? with whom's inshrin'd Those long'd for blisses of Man-kind. Is't for our sins, that righteous Heaven Hath us this Plague 'mongst others Given, This Judgment sent (alas) that we Must lose thy Presence, and want Thee? Or did wee too prophanely slight That blessing, meanly rate thy Sight Enjoy'd? when thou (more justly-nice) By Want dost please t' inhance thy Price: An angry Absence must alone Make thee more reverenc't, and more known. Or last, was't Charity divine, Did through our frailties guilt confine Thee to thy Cells, devouter floar, T' obtaine our pardon? O, restore That Face back, fair Example, thus, Wee shall grow good, lesse criminous. Rare Beautyes were not made at all For cloistring, and live-buriall, Though Bats, Owles be; those glorious Seaven, Th' unwasted Lampes of Earth and Heaven (Sky-brooches) loe, they were not thrust To Corners, lodg'd in Rubbish, dust, But shine to th' World, and traverse by Sphears blazing Pageants: whilst hid lye (Earth chested) Gold, Gems wher's their glory? Sight's all; that magnifies thy story. Some times 'tis wholsome, purest Mayd, To ayre thee through the field and shade; When from some Hill faire-map'd does lye Small Europe, travel'd by thine Eye;
And th' amaz'd People gazing round, As though another Morn were found. For as through sight thou Physick'st us, And our dross-spirits refinest thus To suttle Fire; this Earth Ayre grown, Pure Quintessentiall, whilst (anon) Our Blouds dance revels in each veine; So thou dost Physick thy Selfe againe. Mayes soveraign, delicious ayre, 'Twill make that Cheeke more snowy-fayr (If possible) those Brests of spyce, Thus fan'd, more, Beds of Paradise: Twil make that Angell-shape to strike Our eyes with motion Angell-like Quick, sprightly; improve that daintiest frame So lively, as if all Soule became; Then shew thee oft, deare Cordiall; thus Thou physick'st both thy selfe and us. FLOSTELLAS Nunlike Coynesse FLostella fairest, why so coy, So dainty nice? when but t' enjoy One favour such a taske doth prove, Herculean Labour: tell me Love; What though that daintier hand touch mine (Of Spotlesse Alablaster-shine) Would 't shew lesse faire and sulli'd be? Or lose the Fashion, if by me But kindly prest? though never I That sacred white doe come so nigh, But with wash't hands; nor touch their Down, But reverentiall feare does crown My Devout Palme your Glove all day May freelyer touch, your Sisers may, Silk, needle, lawn, nay, meaner thread; Then is my Hand more vile indeed Then these? or say, you purify Those things by Touch, like Chimistry
May these coorse hands sublime, refine. Or say, those daintier Lips touch mine, Are they impoverish't in their store? Or wast their Delicates the more By often giving? (since they are A lasting sweetnesse) or, less faire, Ought lose their colour Ruby excelling? The more they'r kiss'd, more red and swelling. The wanton Ayre with hovering play May touch them and the tawny Ray Of Phbus, Toys, which often please; Then are my Lips more base then these? The Fly may buzzing kisse, and touch (Unbalm'd) those Cherries; mine's but such Las! can you chide and frowne, when I (Nye starv'd) do beg the Charity, Th' Almes of one kisse? twas never yet Held sin for Starvelings to crave meat; That's free; would you not Life bestow, Where you your selfe ne'r the Poor grow? Nay, Sweetest, were 't love-relish'd, this, You would seeme Richer by a kisse; Love's First-course, Second Mintage tis. The Author's second Dreame of FLOSTELLAS Morning-Walk. TWas Fresh-chek'd May, with all her pride And Progress-bravery beautifi'd: Her musk, perfumes, and Gems of price, To take that sexe, more dainty, nice: When th' Chos-world (late sullen) now Turn'd laughing all, stamp'd on whose brow Fine new Creation: when froz'd Men (Not snailes alone) seem'd Live agen. Forth went the Nimphe, whose eyes fayr ray Had Ianuary turnd to May, And spruc't the poor-clad earth howere With flow'rs, though Flora banish'd were: Forth trip'd Fostel whilst I alone Ingross'd that blessing, th' honour wonn
To attend, her Walks chief Favourite; Sole Guardian to my souls delight: Cal'd by her as if Heav'n had cal'd To Ioyes, wherein blest Saints instal'd (Who would not glory?) Champin thence To weake, yet purest Innocence. For well FLOSTELLA knew that I Would not hurt, but protecting dye; And (though Temptations all, her shape) Would punish, not commit a Rape. Thus, though no morning-star am borne, Yet was I usher to the Morn; Did, next, her Sun-companion shew, Whose hand inrich'd mine with its snow Naught envying now Great Turke, Mogor, Trtarian Chin's Bugeare, or Black Southern Prince; thus septer'd, I Durst boast a fairer Monarchy. Each Object, as we trac't below, With rival-courtship seem'd to wooe My Heavenly Fayr; and bred in me A kind of sportive Iealousie: Birds chant love songs, Gales whisper'd soft Kind tales, stole kisses; whilst (me thought) Hearbs, Flowres hung their love-sick heads Or bow'd with reverence from their beds, Hils animated seemed, rejoyce, And (wanton) Eccho'd back her Voyce: O pregnant Soule! say, what does prove So all-breeding as that womb of Love? Here, whilst I sacrific'd such Vowes, Sighs Incense as Love's zeal allowes Her hand, Breast, th' Alters made to l.' eare Thus breath'd Flostl, O, breath'd sounds were Seraphick Musick! (words? be gone That poor Terme) Thus shee seem'd to own Hold Fondling, don't expose abroad Such sweetnesse to th' Ayres common Road; Be wise; th' Harmonious touch oth' Sphears Not Musick is for Vulgar eares: Repeate the Blisses to thine owne; Tell Venus, or Loves selfe alone: And feed you lickerish eares (reviv'd Your deare Joyes) Fancy makes new liv'd;
Whilst Cupid scores up all, each word, Th' Houre, Minute, in's chast Loves Record. FLOSTELLAS Lute. SIght, Smelling, Tasting, Feeling all be gone, And leave with me the officious Eae alone; Go Slumber, or th' unheeded loytrers play, Whilst thou attend (Souls Favourite) this way: Blesse, blesse thy selfe and me, till seem translated To new divine Ioyes, by that Hand Created. List, list with reverence; devoutly O Harken; th' Orbes Minstrelsyes ham'd here below Whilst gives Flostel Life to her senceless Lte, And warbling language to what late was mute. Harke, what delicious strains and Heavenly rare Doe as 'twere sweeten, and inrich the Ayre! Phebean Harps Great Master finds his skill Scornd by th' Olimpicks, and neglected still When thou once play'st; all listening unto thee; T'whom meaner hands like winds rude blustrings be Or th' note of buling Brooks: All Musick is Untun'd harsh Discord, and but noise to This. Away all dumpish cares, all puling sorrow (You Cloud-drove) fly my world, pack til the morrow; Let me forget I'm Earth, or burdend am With drosse of flesh, but th' Elementall flame Seem raifi'd, turnd Spirits (Ayre doth show Poore, languid) dance my Bloud, your veins o'erflow In glad Tides; whilst those highest Soul faculties Frame all a Masque: that Lute Soule-revels please. O, thr's a sweetly, sweetly-solemn strain Has laid all in a slumbring Trance again, And charm'd all to amazement; view but round, How strange a Metamorphosis there's found: Men stand by th' walls, and furnish out the room Like Arras-pictures, or as to some Tombe Belong'd for Monuments; whilst only flies A glimps of Life or Twilight from their Eyes, Al's turnd a Sepulche, so whist and dead A silence raigns: the sweet Death welcomed.
O, let me thus expire and  It away To dissolution, Nature that Deot pay Of Vapour-breath, that else some boyling Feaver, Stone, Poyson, sturdy Gout, or Stab might sever: Sweet killing Flostel, thus the Soul to stray To Heaven, 'twere t' have Heaven by the way: Such death were but to live; the Gaspes to this, Ore-ravishing Delights, too powerfull bliss. And then I dye a Martyr by the Hand, Though not in wrath; But (spight of countermand) As fleeting Souls last Farewell, I must kiss That beauteous hand first: Fool! all's spoyld by this. FLOSTELLAS Hand and Glove. FAir FLOSTEL, my ambitious Muse, Through its aspiring zeal wu'd choose Rather to chant thy Hand then Glove, Court that Diviner form, my Love; T' whom Snow, with th' Alablaster mine, Great stile of whiteness do resigne: Where azure streams in purling measure Make Cupids Isles, and place of pleasure: But this eclipses vails their light, And pleads commission for't; worse spight. Whilst, cas'd up, beauteous those appear Like sacred Twin-like Relicks there, Worth bove all Romes; like cloyster'd Nus, Or silver, Orbe-involved Moons. Nor nak'd to each unworthy eye, Or the Sun's bolder kisses lye (Sight fit'st for Kings) but then devest, Break forth like Morns, their dusky East, When Silk and Gold ask touch more fine; Some Needle-miracle, designe. Where shown to th' eye small new Creation; Birds, Beasts so neer inanimation, So true, that Natures self does start; Half mothering that meer Child of Art:
Mock'd by this Landskip, nye mistakes For her own work th' Hills, Plants, and Lakes. Sweet'st Recluse-payr! you meanly choyce Beauties triumph it now, rejoyce; Let coorer Hands now boldly shew. And seek t' enamour with worse Snow. Your Gloves kind pardon, if I seem Transported here with what's their Gem, Chief Riches, Glory; wherefore spight Should not ore-long debar my Sight: Since I love These too, even in this Fine, pritty'st winning Beauty is; Both as it self, and as 'tis Thine: So dainty-shap'd, Symmetrick fine, Pure-white withall, that it might stand A rude-drawn Picture to that Hand: From whence (methinks) breath highest sweets, Whose sublimation Iuno fits. This Pattern seem's for best of Gloves (As that for Hands) like Queen of Love's, O Cupid, would'st ordain, that I, Under that form might hug so nye That loved Hand (stupendious feat!) But ah, I fear my Youthfull Heat, Sighes, soft-breath'd whispers, joyfull Dance Oth' Panting-heart, then colder Trance With servent ravenous Kisses, soon Would blab the Cozenage; all undone; When I'm cashier'd eternally: Whereas, that Favourit-Glove layd by, Recloathes that Beauty; exalted is To it's late Paradisian Blss. The Authors third Dream of FLOSTELLAS Evening Walk, and Voyce. FLOSTEL and I (O, fondly'st-kind, Indulgent Stars! thus still you bind)
Flostel and I in Evening fair Stole orth to taste the Garden-ayr; That sweet'st and mildest Age of Day, When Sun does sprinkle kinder ray; Nor breeds our head-ach, whilst Good-night Sends from far West with drowsy light: That and the Morne, those pauses sweet 'Tween th' Aguish fits of Cold and Heate. Those harmlesse Gales were only straying, Which dance the leaves with nieer playing, Nor whisper, whilst, with kind of blisse, May's Flowry beauteous Strangers kiss In signe of welcome: dandling oft Flostellas Curles, when us'd (me thought) Reverence too, least, through their sin, One curle disturb'd or spoild had been: Th' Ayres Concave stil'd to quiet rest, Like Flostels gentle Mayden-brest. Who, mask'd and vail'd (that else had soone Turn'd th' Evening into glorious Noon) Travers'd a gloomy Thicke, design'd For Love maze, Labourinth, where inshrin'd Th' Worlds Beauty appeard. Twas ambush plot T'ore-heare the Nightingales small throat, High, strong'st to boot (That, prais'd to be The Shades prime Songster, harmony) VVith rest oth' Noyse, who all begun, As if to th' then departing Sun Would chirp some merry shril Good-night, And so long Sing as he gave Light. VVhich heard (prime mirthfull jollity) By both, with pleased Eare, drawn nigh: Flostel puts into th' warbling Quire; Faire Goddesse lo, which seemd t' inspire Those little creatures with their skill; Chanting her praise in Athems still. The ruder place seem'd (Chaos-wise) Turn'd to some new drest Paradise, Earth-Heaven, so well that Face and Tongue Might to sweet Cherubins belong. Gods (rapt with joy oth' recreation) T' affaires divine held strait Vacation, Breaking Heavens Parliament asunder, To see, to heare this Mortall Wonder
(Th' Ayr trac'd in measures) while cros-arm'd Some fate, enamourd shewing, Love-charm'd: Consulting all her soon Translation From this base Earth to th' starry station, As their Quire's Mistress; female pow'rs Whilst prais'd, or envi'd from their Tow'rs: Wood-satyres skipping wildly round; This masque at least my fancy found. Lo th' All of Rapture, sweets how high! Best Ioyes the eares capacity Could reach to, only those above, The deare Soule melting Sounds of Love. Her Lute was rare, though dead the sound; This Living, therefore rather crown'd: That, was but hollow Timbers noise, This, sweet, warme, lovely Womans voice: Religion sway'd, else I had nye Been guilty of Voice-idolatry. FLOSTELLA and the Nightingale. RAre, charming Voice! but (O) how rare, Breath'd by that shee so only fair! Whose Face and bodi's beauties be Compos'd with so rare Symmetry (Heavens choice Dsige) so sweetly accorded, One heavenly consort all afforded; And were the Harmony oth' eye; Seem'd Natures silent Melody: N'ere man so doubly blest; th' Eye, Eare! Record it Love, 'twas only here. Each trembling Noate, those Coralls wrought (When born) seem'd swadled, wrapt methought, And (as soone dying) Embal'd within So sweet Breath, as perfum'd 't had beene; Came flying in a precious Ayre Of Odours, 'bove Arabian far: The same sweet Noats (you would have deem'd) The severall souls of Musick seem'd.
O, had I caught and kept alive Those precious sounds (beyond Reptive) Those Spirits of sweetness as they flew! So t'have had constant Musick, True FLOSTELLAS Self by me in those: Her Breath, preserv'd and relick'd close, Had serv'd for soveraign protection 'Gainst poys'nous Plagues and all infection. If that fam'd Harp, could Rivers cause To stand at wanton Gaze, and pause; Beasts, stubborn Rocks, and burly Trees, Made dance in Antique Revels these; Her Voyce must greater Magick prove, And make them court her, fall in Love. Whilst breath'd Flostel and clos'd her song Behold, most pritty wonder sprung; Th' ambitious Nightingale reply'd, Through pertest emulations pride (Chief Chorister ith' feather'd Cout To th' royall Eagle fam'd) in sport Would sing her part, and nimbly runs Her fine-poys'd, quaint divisions: Now Flostel, then the Nightingale, Now she, then she, which should prevail. The Chirper's fal'n to earnest now, No more must Jesting strains allow; 'Twas sober Duell, no idle play, Sharp Brest contention for the Day: Till th' ore-strain'd Bird presum'd still higher, As life 'twould forfeit thus, Expire. Which pirtying, I was fain to intreat, Her softer Heart would make retreat; And end that dangerous strife so nye, By yeilding a false Victory: This Quarrel must not ruin prove Of such a voyce, to th' Spring and Grove: Her Mercy rather should reprive (Double honour's Trophie) keep alive. When, loth to stifle yet my blisses, I silenc'd those sweet Lips with isses; Though but th' Eares yery Joyes transferr'd To th' solid Touch; so, sav'd the Bird.
CRESSAS Funerall, the Love of DIFLORIS. IS any Pastors Eare so deaf to ame, That has not heard of fairest CRESSAS name? So us'd to bleatings, whom that Funerall-knell, Which Groan'd this Nymph to earth; did hearts congeal Hath not arriv'd to? happy sure's that He In this, since knowes not th' common Misery; Distress'd Argadias loss, with whom does share Nature, Grand Mourner; her Beloved fair Cloyster'd in dust, nor (without company) Dy'd she alone, for Hundreds! seem'd to dye In sorrow with her; The Suns self was gone Fast from her Funeralls, and Night came on To bring her Sables. O what new-rays'd Train, Of Goblins strook my sight! which rov'd the Plain With such dire ceremony, rufull guise, As each did his own Funerall solemnize: Lo, Deaths March' was. First went young Swains by pairs (Each crown'd with mournfull Cipress) Usherers To th' solemn Herse; those Four next to't (that led) Bare Shields, were pictur'd, on dark Cole-black Bed Most pale-check'd Virgin lay, prepar'd as 'twere For Bridalls, and which beauteous did appear Even in Death, by Deaths black armes embrac't: And over, in white Characters, was plac't, This, this my Lover, tis my Bridall: So All pass'd along: But following th' Herse did go A single Swain; how dismall look'd, low-pac't Tr'st Bulk of wretchedness, o'r whose face cast A meer Life-dap; seem'd Ghost, to th' Corps before: Sighs bestorm'd about him, whilst be drench'd their His Torrent-eyes; and thus, would needs excell, Surpasse in grief. About his Ha (mix'd well) Forsaken Willow, Cipresse wreath'd; above, This written, Deaths my Rivall. Next did move The Virgin-train in white, which Censrs beare; Dark vail'd like Doom-day Planets: Torch-light there
Forc'd frightfull Noon. And thus they softly trace (Dire measure! how unwilling) to th' sad place, Where they must leave their slumbring Nymph behind, T' enrich the covetous Earth; which (half struck blind) Their Youth beheld: never spake Sorrow more Then now in silence: different Passion store; Here Sighes, there Tears, pale Looks there, yet all one Consor in Grief; This generall alone; All look'd their utmost, till now lost the sight, With whom their Eyes seem'd as 'twere bury'd quite; And (blind to upper things) in Earth beneath Are following her, as though in spight of Death Would still Injoy: with many a pittying muse, Th' hard ground's ore-churlish mold should so abuse That daintiest Body, which though once more nice) Las, now complain'd not; but Death-tranced lyes, What Mayden Adius, what Tears! Swaines kiss'd the Place; All saying, Richer Gem'd Earth never was. SONG. Scornfulness. Know, thou fair Tyrant ere't belong Down will fall Thy grand Scepter, Crown and all, Beauti's imperiall Fort, so strong; When those Sunny Eyes, but late Lamps of day to Dawnings turn, Dim twylights, twinkling Tapers fate; And Glow-worms seem more cleerly burn. Those Spring-like Cheeks and Lip, admir'd (Scean chang'd oft) Autumn's, oul December's draught; Thy gay-form'd Pageantry expir'd: When, Thou living walking Tomb To thine own Beauties shalt appear, And here thine Epiah, like doom, Breath'd in three words [She wa howe're.] Then shall those former Slaves of thine Kings become,
Which wore out Cloaths and Brains (in sum) To court thy peevish Mood's design; Thy Srapadoes felt, were lay'd Panting at thy scornfull feet, Expecting Dooms; one Smile display'd Their Light of life, refreshing sweet. One Kiss oth' Hand or brest at least, Life's food show'd, One calm Word life-ound bestow'd; Beg'd these, poor Amorists, unblest! Then, though churlish Thou did'st scorn, They shall (nobler) pitty thee; Or long before, perhaps (Free-born) Turn wise, renounce Love's slavery. Court now their dainty'st Freedomes, ease, Looking on Thy mock'd Beams undazl'd grown, Charm-proof, bee't Frowns or smiling dress; Queen of some fair World (as 'twere) Leaving thee no Subjects too't, When thou wilt wish th' hadst practis'd there Less Scorn, known more Love-sweets to boot. The Goodmorrow. Fairest, fair Goodmorrow from Thy Servant Voyce and Lute present; Lo, Day's glorious Prince (Brides-groom To th' Mor) is up, for progress bent; Bounteous, gracious in his Rayes, Th' Worlds bright influentiall Show', Though I stand Frozen here this hour, Till thou (my sweetest Sun) do'st Blaze. Plumed Songsters chant to th' eares, Earth and Heaven smiles combine; Pleas'd whole Natures Cheek appears, O' do not Thou unpleasing Shine:
Lovers (often) their bad dayes Prove, and good; last night my Sun Did set in lowring Clouds, Night done, O let her Rise more gently, Blaze. May those Dewy slumbers, steep't Her fair Eyes sunk down to th' Heart Have soften'd that, what time she slept; The like might Pillow's Down impart, Mollisie both Head and Brain: Break orth sweetly'st, O my Sun, Thy Casements glassie East, nor shun This Morning-sacrifice, as vain. Or if Couched still my Fair, Might this Lute, Voyce lull thee yet Gentler, breed Morn slumbers rare; So, keep till Noon thy Blazing fit; When or Light▪ warmth I've design'd Short visit, O look Beamy, cleer, That I may Vaunt m dearest Dear Wk'd Gentle, though she slept unkind. Lovers mixt Weather. WHence is it that Lovers prize The Object more, that full enjoying, Doubtings when through Rubs arise, Or discreet Reserv'dness, Coying? Seldome when her Smiles do glance, Sparkle, or kind words Intrance; Sweet-meat kisses Lock'd-up Dainties held, rare Blisses? So when solemn Clouds be o're, Sweeter Sunshine, lovelyer groweth; Or, when sickly fits, the more Valu'd Health; what Ioyes bestoweth! Worldly troubles cares if cease, How's Endear'd our calm-like Ease! Heightnings carry All things from their Bad Contrary.
But that Coyness, if exceeds Civil bounds, Affronts discover (Churlish, froward grown) but breeds Qualms ith' Generous minded Lover; Through th' embitter'd Sauce worse far Th' After-favours relish'd are: She's lesse prized When enjoy'd, who once, despised. Too much suffering, Love's Wounds Leaves Ill-skinned o're, confounds. The Spring-time. BEhold those chrystall Founts Which Prl and wander o're the Plain; How branching, plum'd those lofty Mounts, Plush-Banks bedrest with Flow's again: Th' whole World's reviv'd; Earth deck'd in Maquing robes, bright Heav'ns surrond Cleer-check'd, sweet'st-breathing Gales abound, Whilst Mortalls grow new-liv'd. Chief Empress of the Spring, Come forth with all thy Beamy pow'r, Thine Hand mayd since does smiing bring, Let not the lovely'st Mistress Low'r; Least damping thence Th' whole worlds fair Spring-tyde, with my faithful Drooping thy Frown to both imparts, Through strangest Influence. Come Sweetest, let us trace To yonder Bow'r, prospective Hill, Where th' Springs Musitias, more to grace, shall with their Carolls fill: There's VENUS Fount,
Melting its streams forth from those Rocks above; All, Lectures of Ioy, Beauty, Love shall now to thee Recount. The Face and Glass. Sweet, let me hold Thy Glass as Hand-mayd, uncontroll'd, And shew thee more then th' whole World can present, That is thy Fellow; yet (alas) Not such, since 'tis but shadow'd Face, Thine true, substantiall Natures ornament: Sweet'st Coynage though, portray'd beside In my Hearts Tablet does reside. More Guiltless (know) And bold, I can this duty show, Since rest confirm'd that Sight, not makes thee Proud, Although chief Cause of pride there be, Transporting thoughts Self extasie, Since view'd such Sparkling wonders through that Cloud; In which So's beauteous worth I do Vaunt, glory, that's Unequall'd too Not least proud Thought In Looks appears, no Action's wrought But what might shew Neglect or Pleasedness; As if thou (sober) all did'st see, Thank'd thy Creatour thence, so free: That Brigt-chek'd, frozen Lake (us'd but for dress) Thou look'st not in with Doating vein, As Glass'd in chrystall streams the Swain. Dear, still permit, Since have my serious Ends in it; Hoping, that while thou view'st those charming Eyes▪ Thou wilt my Love-intranced Sence Pardon and Pity both, from thence: And though my Wages payd, since Beauti's Skies Thus long Behold, and gently this, Grant to my  Tuch one Kiss:

Now shines on me my sweetest Sun, As yet my Spring-time is not done, And I boast that I am living; Whilst my Soul and Sences dance, Or else prove some blessed Trance Through those Ioyes from thee Reviving; Now I view Th' All of Beauty, touch it too: Those Hands and Brest: all sweetness heare That Tongue, Voyce, musicall to th' Eare: O yet more (to th' Joyes abounding) Let me Time's advantage take, Reap some Kisses for Love's sake; Whilst those Eyes prove deeply Wounding, Let impart Lips their sugred Balm to th' Heart. My starv'd Desire those Fruits afford Though want Love's soveraign Food and hoord Nay (my Dear) such shortned Blsses? Think not One my Life preserves, Or, that More oth' sweet Conserves Ought could make me slight thy Kisses, Who do swear Each begets new Longings there. Thus high-grac't, I've no fickle Lovers Tast, Nor can those Lips or cloy, or waste.
Absence. Sweetest know did not controul Cruell'st Fate, my steps, this our, Thus to leave I had no power, Parting as from mine own Soul Cloud thine Eye seems over-vayling, As grown sad, did'st Pitty me, Which Looks grandest honour be, Hearts-support; since smiles prevayling (Else I vow Dear) would scarce Delight me now. Yet that Cloud o're-heavy, sad Wish I should not, least thy trouble Mine but Aggravating double; Leave me to my Nightly shade (Far worse Curse thy want producing) And with pleasing Glimmers dresse Those Looks, though not smilingnesse; Love lesse sorrow thence infusing: Though indeed Saddest looks there Pleasure breed. Ghost from thee this Body goes Vowing to my Heart's esteemed (Thoughts of her so Precious deemed) Night these Ees shall never cloze, Nor Day their -curtains ever, But thy dearest Image shall Sleep with me, and Wake withall; As my Guardianangell ever: Whatere's Rare Shall to th' Thought present my Fair.

And th' earthly Globe's Epitome being crownd: Th' whole Worlds contraction! Though rarer far this Excellence, Life sparkling thence, All heightned still through Looks, Words, gracefull Action. What lovely'st Radiance in the Eye, Souls splendid Orb! what Visions there Of Beauties, Virtues, speakingly Both shine and move! what Springs ppear In dainty'st Checks▪ delicious Beds (as twere) Of Heav'n-orn Flowers! Heav'n planted Fruits, both Pearls and Gem Lips boast in them; Prime-model'd sweets; great LOVE'S Imperiall Bowes 'Las that should prove this Quintescense Of Worth, like meanest Creatures, frail▪ Such vaunts the Rose her self to sence, (Proud, fragrant Garden-Queen) though pale Drooping ere long, turn'd Coars our eyes bewail: So I've observed That choyce-stain'd Tulip, Gillystow' Fresh-cheek'd this hour; Fruits lovely, sweet, ere long grown old, Death-starved. All things are Changing, fading here, Minds, Bodies prove their sinking Fate, Like those young Seasons of the Year; That Beauties wither'd, gone, which lat Florish'd ador'd, Slaves waiting on her State; Now pitty'd, scorned: Bright Virtue, Wisdome though should lend Lustre to th' end, Chang'd Cheeks though those, like Sunshine-beams adorned
SONG. A French Villanell Englished. Il ya dans ce Village, &c. 1. IN this Village lives Ishried The faire Saint my thoughts adore: Paris, 'midst her Beauteous store, Shewes me nought so Faire, refined: Ah, ah, how sweet it is, Wer't to Dye for thee my Bliss! 2. All times shall I serve, admire Her law-giving Lips and Eyes; More then King my self I prize In this new-rays'd Love-desire: Ah, ah, how sweet it is, Wer't to Dye for thee my Bliss! 3. Truth it is, so dearly seizing Proves her Beauties charming grace, Less my Liberty I praise Then this Servitude so pleasing: Ah, ah, how sweet it is, Wer't to Dye for thee, my Bliss! 4. I not know the artfull Passion Other flattering Lovers vent; But for all deep Complement, Make my Faire this protestation; Ah, ah, sweet it is Wer't to Dye, for thee my Bliss.
EPITAPH On a young Lady. HEre Chastity it self doth lye, And Beauties self; whom never eye Nor tongue could tempt as yet to love; Till Death his violent dar did prove, And (powerful'st) won unto his Bed, Though she was even then Ravished. SONG. Hero and Leander: Fra'd after that of Dido was a Carthage Queen, &c. 1. HERO 'LAs unhappy Mayd, That ere Loves winged Boy So treacherously thy Heart betray'd, To Love, but scarce enjoy: Curs'd be the Hand, the cruell Bow, Which did wound thy poor Heart so; Accurst the ravenous Wave, That raging, bent so murdrously, Forc'd thy sweet-fac'd Boy to dye, And needs would be his Grave. 2. HERO, Long with wishing eyes Awayts her Curled Love, And from her Tower entreats the sk And waters gentle prove: Many a Vow she numbred or'e (If would wast him safe to Shore)
To Gods of Seas and Wind; For why, she fears too rough the stream For her poor Delight to swim, And least should prove Unkind 3. HERO, Sees with smoothest Brow The well pleas'd Waters , Those Winds are hush'd, and Heav'ns fair show, The rather to Beguile: When strait the Nymph from far discries (Nimble are poor Lovers eyes) LEANDER Waves embrace; And leaving shore, with cast-up eye If thence his Goddess might spy, To glide the Streams apace. 4. HERO, Looks with gladdest thought, And Ravisht hasts to shore; When strait the sturdy Waves high-wronght, And Bellowing Winds do roar: When she the storm encreasing new, With Tears and Sighes which from her blew, Does see her Lover fail; And, th' onely Bark, his Body show (Shipwrack'd) beaten to and fro, No struglings might avail. 5. HERO, Grieves, and by and by LEANDER 'fore her Eyes, With stretcht-out Arme and many a Cry On HERO, sinks and Dies: Who takes no time now to Complain, Calls and cryes since all but vain, She sees no cause to live; And so the unpittying Wave bestrides, Which soon her dainty'st Body hides, And Both one Tomb does give▪
English'd out of Montemayor in Spanish. On LEANDER Leandro Amoroso Fuego ardia, &c. LEander, burning in an Amorous fire, Stole down to th' Liquid murmuring shore, attended With one Love-thought alone, his dear Desire; Through whose Bold force no danger apprehended: Which flaming Light through streams when darted was, God Neptune angry rouz'd, with Waves to quench it; God Cupid too might better ceas'd that Blaze, 'Tween HERO'S wisht-for Armes have sought to Drench The Morns air Light to th' Voyage, urg'd, as 'twere; Night gently rose, with friendly'st shades surrounding; More kind then either Love, or Fortune were: O wretched Lovers fates, belief confounding! That Love and Fortune both, in one combined, Such dismall Death ith' end for him Designed. Another English'd out of Montemayor, in Spanish: On a coy Mistress. Los Oios no peccaron en Miraros, &c. MIne Eyes in Looking (Sweetest) does not sin, If but pretend to view, and to Admire you; Should my Soul Merit plead, aspire to win, Wish't not worse Evll, then still to Want, desire you: Nere speaks my Tongue to you, be't silent, dumb, If word, with thought to move you, forth it warble: My Tears, if plot to soften overcome, You punish may, hardning your Brest as Marble: But do not snatch from me your dearest Sight, For though it cause (ith' End) my secret anguish, Sad Life I'le spend in viewing you, earths Light; Since no Life else, for none I feel, or languish: My Soul, if lives without you's Dead, or dying; Hope of its Torment still best Cure applying▪
Happiness. THere is a precious thing whom we all bless As Gem of Heaven, intitled Happiness; For which the pin'd World plods and sweats, approves From Towers to Thatch, from Silks to Leather Loves; The gen'rall thirst and hunger onely this, To frail Humanity prime Minion 'tis: But most, how blindly hurry to th' wrong School T' instruct them in't! their Tutor is most Fool. Reason disclaim'd, Sence, Fancy proves their Guide; Thus those deluded Pilgrims travell wide, But ne'r enjoy, becomming still worse strayes, In that their Magick-strow'd, unlucky Maze. He, Honous Blazes, Popular breath's ayre Hunts after; wanton Venus Breasts (made bare) Th' Other admires, how Courts; with stallion-heat Neighing after th' flesh: That, studies how to Eate, Carouse to pleasure, Lauds his various mess; Whose Hell-deep Gorge, tooth's nicety to please, That Elementall store-house wanteth food; Th' whole Globes a thin starv'd market: ther's his Good. Th' fourth hugs his Mint, gay mettall does adore: Th' fifth Horses, Hounds (keen sports-man) loves, playes o're His life just like a Game; whilst Lazyer He Sits yauning, looks about, an Idlesby. All these Graspe ayery Blisses, bitter sweets; Tarant'la-stung, but dye 'midst laughing fits; Since onely Virtue (Heavens choyce Off-spring known, Frail Earths best seasonning sweet, life's life alone) This Soules Elixr, tenfold Indies weares, And on her Votaries as Gift confers: In Her stor'd All. Sublim'd this Virtue growes Through Learning, arts; What's well, that former shows, And yeilds both Comfort, Peace of a Good Action; The nobler souls prime glory, and satisfaction: Th' other gives Knowledge, unlocks to thine eye Nature with each her richest Mystery Infuse but Third to these, the Moderate mind (Though shadow-like with virtue 't seems combin'd) Who seeks but what's Enough, and there behold That Happy man, great Lord oth' Western Gold
(If He'l but think so) Prince of this vast Round, This Medley of Sea and Land, by himself Crown'd. Nor can his starvling-Fortunes miserable Make him or wretch'd, if to subsist but able, T' uphold a Being, and worst Poverty May Natures low Ambition satisfie. Thus he enjoyes himself still, is the same, Though's Changling Fortun's turn'd; nor finds a shame In being Poor, or's heard to rayl upon His Stars for their extortion; stands alone, Like unmov'd Rock, the battering Wind and Wave, Mocking their cholerick Frensies; bids 'em rave. Sucks as sweet pleasing Ayre, talks, eats, and sleeps As hearty as ever, whilst his Curtain keeps Forth Care with Day: Good Bedfellow, as kind, Soft, Down-support, does still his Pillow find. And as friends flinch away, but laughs to see Th' odd humour of the Age, how Poverty Is left alone, save of her own lean Crew; The Worlds grown Coy, known Face, strangers shew And look on him A-squint, whilst cheerfull he Finds from within the sweetest Company; Can hug himself: That base Tribe pittying still, And if his burlyer fortunes claim the style Of Plump Prosperity, if now he showes Some-body in the World, how kindly flowes The late ebbing Rout, what Hails and Visits then! Both make him Mirth, he's now belov'd agen. English'd out of Petrark, in Italian. On his first view of LAVRA. Era'l giorno, ch' al Sol si scoloraro, &c. THere was a Day when the Sun's beams grew pale Through reverence of you, Lights chief Disposer, When those fair Eyes (dear Mistress) ah too rail Ungaurded bound my Soul, no band th' incloser: Time serv'd not then for Breach repairs, or Fence 'Gainst CUPIDS storm, yet felt I sore suspition, Strong fears (though loves disease more vulgar) whence Chief sprug my bleeding woes, this thrall'd condition;
Love, treacherous love, found me disarmed there, When through mine Eyes to th' Heart free road extending (Eyes, now the Sluce to tears, sad Foords as 'twere) Though little with Loves honour, glory ending; Struck Naked me with Dart, whilst not Alone, To Coy well-armed you his Bow was shown. Another English'd out of Petrarch in Italian: On LAVRA veyl'd. Lassare il Velo Oper Sole, O per Ombra, &c. THat you leave off your Veyl, by Sun of shade (Mistess) I have not seen, nor can discover; As though you thought my Grand desie allay'd That way, which throngs my Heart, become all Loer; Since secret thoughts, there harbour'd, lurking, do Stifle me still through Want, breed more Desiring: I've seen choyce Goodness to adorn that Brow, But since that Love disclos'd my inward ring, Those Sunshine-curls with Cloud be-veyled o're; Your splendid amorous Look, o'recast, obscured? Thus, snatch'd from me what most I prize, Adore, If govern'd by that Veyl, worst plagues endured; Which, friezing me to Death, be' heat or cold, Your fair Eyes sweetest Light does darken, infold. The doubting Lover. THrough doubt, desire, he friezes, burns (Quotidian Ague) both Zoanes turns, Torrid, frozen: Lauds his Saint, adores; Hugs his late slavery, yet deplores: Thanks, blames his Stars, as kind, unkind▪ Can talk t' himself, and wandring Wind; Fool it with th' Eccho, pleas'd with Trees Lone Rocks and Cells Societies: Kisses his Chain, lov'd poyson'd Dart; Hopes, fears: a poor Convulsion'd Heart!
Man of all eathers; lowrs this hour, Next smiles; 'tis Sun-shine, Hony-shower. How's her words poys'd! her each glance, look How Anatomiz'd! Star-gaze, his Bock: He Nods, Sighs, Breaths, by Rule; so sore, Love's Good-behaviour, binds all o're. Idols his Creed; his Trade inrol'd Under-ground delving▪ though seeks Gold. In brief some Heaven's, more Hells do seize him. Nought but t' enjoy or dye, can ease him. The Despairing Lover. HOw like's that wretch't, unhappy Lover, Whose Travels nought but scorns discover, To the chas'd Deer; their Dwellings are Like-rac'd, and sadly alike they fare. As Wilderness his Fancy shewes About him, which wild thoughts compose. Those Dogs that hunt him, lean Dispair, Grief, Sorrow; fierce th' whole Kennell are: Killingly leet, well-nos'd for scent, Too True, too Bloody-diligent: Whose mouthes spit Venme, from whose eyes Quick Balls of raging wild-fire flyes. Those dismall Hornes that storm about His eares, and ring his Funerall out, Those last disdainfull breath'd Cheeks, came From his o're-coy, Heart-breaking Dame; Made terribler, far far more shrill Through Fancy's doubling Eccho still. The frightfull Hunter's glance, call'd View (Whilst through the Road or Lawn pursue) Seem's th' oft imagin'd Vision, forme, Or's Doom-fac'd Mistress; that she-storme. That Shaft sheath'd in his side▪ Desire, Worst-pointed with a flame of fire; Which drinks Life-pirits, feeds upon Blood, yea, fries th' marrow through the bone, Full-blown with sighs, and sobbings oft: Imbost with rage, and heat of thought▪
Thus, when th' ore-hounded wretch his Race Has run, and so long held the Chase As faintest gasping hopes supply With fleeting breath; when 'midst the Cry, No Comforts cooler stream relieving, For Soyl; nor Reasons Bay help giving: With Stag-like tears he falling dyes, Scorns Triumph, and Love's Sacrifice. English'd out of Montemayor, in Spanish. On a Pastorall Lover. Estava Lusitano repstando. YOung Lustan sat grazing (Solemn turn'd) His Snow white Flock, through Verdant Plain dispersing; Green Sheep-hok, Scepter-like, th' own hand adorn'd, He view'd the ground, with's own sad Thoughts conversing: And raising th' Eyes sometimes, forth Breathed this. If prov'st so soveraign (my Disease) excelling, Who sayes, that, osing me not saving is? Knows he not that in Pain there's Pleasure dwelling? Since for my Care no salve of comfort sought? She need not to regard thee: O Vandaessa Those Ignorans mistake my Mystick lot; For, since receiv'd thy Looks divine Impressa, I count it Grief not to be griev'd, or wounded: My Malady's my Medcine thus compounded. The Offering. Sweet'st Saint, Accept my Vowes, which Incence like And sume before thee in solmn Sacrifice; My flaming Heart my chast Desires allow, Tose Morning-offer'd Sighs, and Evening too;
Receive their inder Beath, whereof each one Seems to put up short begging Orison Or Love-suit to thee: Pitty the complain Each whispers in thine Eare. And least I fain In my Devotios, please but other-whil, To Answer with the sparkle of a Smile That I'm accepted; but if frowns you bring Alas my Heart's turn'd mee dead Offering. Fain wou'd I please my Saint, O gently bow T' intrust my Ignorance, and teach me how: Crown me thus far, thy Fav'rite , And I'le disclaim all other Saints, but Thee. The Complaint. WHy was I Born, Or not born Blind? Though thence the sco; Of whole mankind, Their Pitty, or Wonder; That o I'de Womans shape nere known; Or seeing, had I mist but one, But Thine alone; We onely kept sunder. O then kind Heavens you had A Soul of Anguish, Tha's now conden'd to sad un-rest, And endlessly must languish: Yet check my Heart, no more These Plaints; give or'e: Since thou hadst rather dye through her rejection Then not have seen so rare Perfection
Mutual Love, Conjugall. MOst true that Love, sweet sweetest those Enjoyments where there Liking is (Whence Value of each other growes) For th' Person, Parts, Conditions, these; To that's measure Seems reduc'd the Fancies pleasure; Vaue coyning all that hour, Though something wrought by Nature's pow'. Mird where not enforc'd by friends, Nor strain'd through ondness, greedy Mood To Honour, Wealth, such Worldly ends (Although it Competence be good, Srves to season Mrrige, life, on grounds of reason) Ksses else bad food become, Faint qualmish Sweets that Wedlock-sum▪ Love away, but wasting time Those Acts appear, with sigh for ; At least when ' Nvely, joy's prime Of Wealth is o're, when cloying growes; Poor sauce oording To th' Bd choyce delights affording, sence  please, By th' Fay that seems chec'd, with ease. So to th' hungry loathsome prove Meats oft, where crost thir Fancy, mind: Strage Damping too, where either's Love Contemn'd  first in ruder kind, Oce Disdained; Tait it leaves, though th' Pize obtained: This sel lov to all , That  would have their Lovs abus'd.
Besides th' offensive scorn, it leaves Of colder Love stamp'd Jealousie; Whereas each nobler Spirit conceives Ioyes lost, if come not kindly free: Tenfold deeming Those Sweets too, inhanc'd esteeming, Whilst but thinks Another's Pleas'd, Lov'd, choycest Minions flames appeas'd Pure sweets alone Where no such Love-affrontings known; Though Civill, modest coyness shown. Constancy. AFter liking of each other, Needfull Constancy does prove To th' harmonious Marriage-Love, That no Fog those Joyes might smoother; Such strong setled Temper, Mind (Link'd discretion) as th' enjoying Damps no Love through fuller Cloying; Nor Worl's businesses combind, Houshold-cares, Which breed oft distemper, Iars. Some from thence dull Melancholies Raise, become untuned oft; Or, through worldly Pleasures caught, Vain Moods rambling sensuall Follies: Whilst his constant fixed Soul Can both worldly Businesse, Pleasure Manage rule, in sober measure, Not like th' Ayre or Waters oul; But unmov'd Like th' Earths Center, Rocks approv'd.
Thus, less tost his Brain, confounded Through those Objects manifold, Counting Her chief wrth of Gold; Lve's preserv'd, still deeply grounded: And if envious Sickness, Time Change her Cheeks, for former Beauty Fancies, loves (kind Husband's duty) Sweets enjoyed once, ith' Prime: Holds his Rad Planet-like, for ever trod.
