THE Case of Samuel White Humbly Presented, To the Honourable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Parliament Assembled. I Went to India, Anno 75. as Mate on board the Ship Loyal Subject, Captain William Goodlad Commander, for the East-India Company; and did with the know∣ledg and consent of the Governour of Fort St. George, and by leave of the foresaid Com∣mander remain in India, giving security to indempnifie the said Commander, from the penalty of one Hundred Pounds, he was lyable to pay for any Person so left behind him, which being accordingly exacted by the Company at the Ships return, was duly dis∣charg'd by my Correspondent here. Mr. George White my Brother, did at this time reside in the Kingdom of Syam, whi∣ther at his Invitation I remov'd, and voyaging soon after to Metchlepatam, it happened in time of my being there, that the King of Syam's Agent applied himself to the Chief of the Companies Factory, for a Person well qualified, to navigate a Ship of the Kings, betwixt that place, and the Port of Mergen: To which employ he was pleas'd to recommend me, and I continued therein about four years, being so happy to have my services well ac∣cepted by the said Kings Ministers, and by them so favourably represented to his Majesty that he was graciously pleased, to let me in a large measure partake of his Royal Bounty and favour. In this Interim, Mr. Constant Phaulkon, who sometime had his dependence on my Bro∣thers friendship, was become very considerable in the Court of Syam; as he has since by his great merit, rais'd himself to be the Prime Minister, having all Important Affairs of the Kingdom entirely under his Charge and Conduct: and by his kind assistance, I was ad∣vanc'd to another employment, much more advantageous; being made Shawbander of Tenassary and Mergen, whereby I was entrusted with the Collecting and managing all the Kings revenues in that Province, and was likewise Chief Commissioner for his Maritime Af∣fairs, of which my preferment I delayed not to give notice to my friends in the Compa∣nies service at Fort St. George, Metchlepatam and Bengall, humbly tendring my best services to their Commands, in whatever I might be useful to the Publick or their private Concerns, and they were pleased to return me their kind Congratulations, and give me several oc∣casions of serving them. Nor was it long after my being rais'd to this Capacity, that there did present a suitable opportunity to testifie my Zeal to the Companies Service; for their Ship the Golden Fleece, in her return from Bengall to England, sprung a desperate Leake, in which distress the only near and commodious Port that presented for their relief was Mergen, whither in confidence of my friendly assistance they came, and found me as ready to grant, as they could be to request, all that my interest and influence there could afford them, in my giving them the use of my own Slaves for the more expeditious unlading their Ship, securing their Goods in Warehouses ashore, and assisting the relading thereof with∣out the least Charge, when the Ship was refitted to proceed on her Voyage, for which I also supplied them with whatever they wanted at the very same rates the King himself paid, and wholly excused them from all the duties of the Port. But I need not particularize how fully I answer'd or rather exceeded their expectations in all things, or call any other Testimony for proof thereof, than the report made here at home by Cap∣tain James Cook the Commander, who was so sensible of my good deservings on this occasion, that he very earnestly solicited the Committee for some signification of their kind accepting those my considerable Services. But an over-ruling power amongst them, ren∣dered this grateful motion ineffectual; however I am not the less pleas'd, that I had the good fortune to be Instrumental in securing and forwarding so great a Concern as that was, which I understand did here produce no less than 190000. l. It was now the beginning of the Year 84. when I received orders from the Court of Syam,
to sit out several Ships for prosecuting the War against the Kings of Golcondah and Pegu, as by the same Command I also did the succeeding year, in which expeditions I must own, we were very much befriended by the President and Council of Fort St. George, who sup∣plied us with Ammunition and Naval Stores, and accommodated us with some English men for those occasions, nor were they wanting to congratulate our successes, and make large proffers of their readiness, to give us further assistance, as appears by their general Letters, both to my Lord Phaulkon, and my self: while on the other side, there was all possible care taken by the King's special Command, that not the least injury or offence should be done to the Company, or any under their protection, as was strictly enjoin'd in the Commission to every Commander; and accordingly amongst many smaller Vessels, two Considerable Ships that were taken at Pegu, and brought into Mergen, tho they appeared to belong to the Inhabitants of Mechlepatam, yet upon producing English Pasports were without further trouble discharged. In this good accord stood the Correspondence betwixt the King of Syam and our Company to all appearance, when in April 87. we were surpris'd with the strange News that Captain Nicholson, Admiral of the Companies Fleet in Bengall, had there seized on a Ship of the King of Syams, called the Revenge, Commanded by Captain Edward English, who then came from Fort St. George, where he had been kindly received and supplied with Ammuni∣tion and Men for the Kings service, and these ill tidings were soon followed, by the like In∣telligence, concerning a Sloop, of the Kings called the Mary, taken by Captain Battin, in the Rebecca, at the Port of Pudicherry, about which time, I also receiv'd Letters from my friends at Fort St. George, acquainting me that the Company had sent out positive or∣ders, for making War upon the King of Syam: Of all which, I did (as my duty obliged me) immediately dispatch advices to my Lord Phaulkon, and the Privy Council, humbly Offering it as my opinion, that since we well knew this undeserved rupture must be oc∣casioned by the malicious misreports of some, who were in that regard no less Enemies to their own Countries Honour, and welfare, than the Affairs of Syam; and that against all the Rules of Justice, and Law of Nations, these acts of Hostility were committed, before any Cause assign'd, by making complaint, and demanding satisfaction. It would therefore be convenient, that his Majesty of Syam employ'd some fitting Person to the King of England, to give him a true account of these unkind usages, and endeavour to renew and corro∣borate that Correspondence, which his Majesty of Syam had in so many instances mani∣fested his intention, and desire to conserve with the English Nation. My Lord Phaulkon and the Council, made their applications to the King, concerning this motion of mine, who was pleas'd not only to approve thereof, but also to do me the Honour of nominating me, to serve him in that occasion: and because there was then no Ship of the Kings in Port, so proper for the Voyage, as this of my own, whereon I afterwards escap'd with my Life; I had orders to fit her, and my self, with all expedition, and be in readiness to proceed upon receipt of Letters from Court; with considerable Presents to the King, and his Royal Consort, which were dispatching towards me, and had certainly come to hand in twenty days time, had not the sudden fatal change of things, after the arri∣val of Captain Weltden in the Curtana, not only prevented that design, but occasioned the Massacre of about sixty of my Country Men on that Place: I only by a Miracle of Mercy, being left to bring the sad account of that bloudy Tragedy, which I am ready to represent when this Honourable House shall be pleas'd to command it. And now I am come to that unhappy Period when those heavy Calamities began to fall upon me, which have brought me to ruin, and desolation. For at the time I fled aboard my Ship to save my Life, I left behind me 21877. l. which I had at that Place in sundry effects, as I can prove by an exact account of the particulars upon my Oath, having also the Testimony of other credible Persons, for the greater part thereof, and under the pre∣sent circumstances of the War our Company has been pleas'd to make with the King of Syam, I have too much reason to despair of retrieving any thing of it: but this was yet but a part of the severe persecution I have suffered; for while I was under these disasters at the place of my Residence, my other considerable Concerns that were abroad in Trade, were made a Prey, by the Companies Servants, which is more particularly my present complaint, and I sub∣joyn a true account thereof as follows. In the foresaid Sloop Mary taken by Captain Battin, I Shipp'd sixty Chests of Copper, for my proper account, consigned to Monsr. Delandres, second of the French Factory at Pudicherry, which the Gentlemen at Fort St. George were pleas'd to condemn in their Court, and confiscate to the Companies use; wherein I first accuse them of the grossest injustice, for they might if they had pleased, have been satisfied of my Property, in those Goods by the bill of Lading, which was produc'd in their Court in my behalf, and not
only at the time when I Shipp'd that Concern, but also when the Vessel was taken, there was no War declared with Syam, and therefore with what legal pretence, they could lay claim to those Goods of mine, I leave to the judgment of all impartial Persons in the World. But I am further also to accuse them, of the basest Ingratitude to me, who had in the like case deserv'd much more friendly dealing from them; for in the preceding year, when one of the King of Syam's Men of War, brought a Prize into Mergen, belonging to the Sub∣jects of Golcondah, and in the examination of the Cargo, I found sundry Goods to a consi∣derable amount that appear'd to belong to Mr. Robert Freeman the Companies Chief at Metchlepatam, I secur'd them for him, and remitted them to the President, and Council at Fort St. George, as I can prove by their own acknowledgment, and this my kindness they were pleased so soon after to gratifie in seizing my aforesaid Copper to the amount of 400 l. The next thing I complain of is, concerning an Adventure I had on board the Derreah Dowlett, a Ship of the King of Syam's, which by order from Court, I laded with sundry Merchandises and dispatch'd for Acheen, having also liberty to lade on her a considerable quantity of Rice, and Liquors for my own account, which I consigned to William Mallett, my Servant; whom I sent on the same bottom, and they were no sooner arrived at Port, and began to dispose of the Cargo in April, 87. but Captain Consett came thither in the Berkly Castle, wearing his Majesties Colours, and took the said Ship, and tho my Factor did then manifest unto him my aforesaid Concern by Invoice and Orders, and made demand accordingly; yet would he not be prevailed with, to restore the least part thereof, but vi∣olently seized on all, whereby I am damnified, the amount of 1838 l. as besides my own Oath, I can prove by the Testimony of others; At the same time and place, the said Cap∣tain Consett took also a Ship of mine, then riding in that Road, under the Ensign of our Nation called the Success of about 100 Tuns burthen, and tho the Master Caleb Tracy, did make appear by my Commission to him that she belonged to me, yet was he not pleas'd to take the least notice thereof, but Seiz'd and carried her with him to Bengall, which Ship cost me set to Sea 450 l. My next, and greatest Article of this kind, is concerning my Ship Satisfaction, burthen about 350 Tuns, which in January 87. I dispatched with a Cargo, to Mocah in the Red Seas, the Prime Cost of stock and block amounting to 7800 l. which I solemnly affirm did entirely belong to my self; She arrived in safety at her Port, the 20. of April, where having delivered her Cargo ashore to my Factor, Mr. William How, the Ship was accord∣ing to my Order, sent to a place about five Leagues distant to take in a quantity of Salt, while my Factor was making sale of my Goods; but on the 25. of May, Captain Andrews, in the Ship Charles the Second, arriv'd there in the equipage of an Admiral of his Ma∣jesties Fleet, wearing the union Flagg at the Main Topmast head, and first he sent his Barge ashore with several armed Men, to seize Mr. How, and the Purser Mr. Wortly, as they did, and carried them Prisoners aboard his Ship, where at first sight of Captain Andrews, Mr. How deliver'd him a Letter from me directd to the Commanders of any of the Companies Ships he should happen to meet with, in which I signified my Property in the aforesaid Ship and Car∣go, and humbly requested their assistance and friendship, as occasion might require. But in∣stead of exercising any such humanity towards them or me, he not only detained them his Prisoners, but went himself ashore, to take possession of my Estate, entring the House wherein my Goods were lodg'd in a sort of Triumph. For he did himself the Honour to have the King's Flagg carried before him, which he afterwards fix'd upon the House, and having thus made himself Lord and Master of my Goods, he sent two Boats with armed Men, in search of my Ship, which they soon found out, and tho there was not the least resistance made, by the use of any Weapons, nor any other defence, save the Mens shut∣ting themselves into their close quarters, yet at the first entring of my Ship, they fired thirty or forty Pistols, and therewith mortally wounded the Master Mr. William Rand, whom with the rest they carried Prisoner on board the Charles the Second, where after Nine days languish∣ing he dyed, and was used by Captain Andrews with that barbarous cruelty, that his ear∣nest request of but having a friend admitted to speak with him, a few hours before he expired, was denied him. The Commander being thus Murthered, and the Ship taken, Captain Andrews goes on to do what he thought fit with my Goods, converting some to his own use, selling some at Mocah, and carrying the rest to Bombay, where at his arrival he first paies his Hommage to the General Sr. John Child, by making a present to his Lady out of his spoils being several of my large China Jars, And some time after he had thus begun to do Execution, they go on to the tryal and condemnation of my Ship and Goods in their Court of Admiralty, where (his Excellency the General having turn'd out Dr. St John, who was Commission'd by the late King Charles) Sr. John Weyborn the Deputy Governour of the Island, did by the Generals Commission sit in the place of Judg, and had for his Mates Pa∣trick
Simpson the Minister, and Henry Thrustcross a Factor, which I must by the way observe, was an open violation and contempt of the very Charter, whereon they ground their pre∣tended Authority, for erecting that Court; For the said Charter which by their great in∣terest with some of the Ministers of State, they obtained in the year 83. does expresly re∣quire that it consists of a Person learned in the Civil Law, and two Merchants, whereas Sr. John Weyborn was bred a Sailor, Patrick Simpson is a Scotch Parson, and Henry Thrustcross a Native of India, all of them wholly Ignorant in the Civil Laws, but they prov'd them∣selves nevertheless sufficient to serve this turn. For when they were set up, Captain An∣drews first exhibited a Libel to them, alledging the Ship to belong to the King of Syam, and it was very industriously endeavoured both by the General and him, that they should find it so, in hopes that by its passing for the Concern of a Prince whom they call'd their Enemy, it would both help to stifle the loud outcrys of the Commander's Blood, and also give them a surer Title to their Prize, but the Men of my Ship continued all stedfast in affirming that I was the sole Proprietor, to the best of their knowledge, (altho I am able to prove that one of them was tempted by a considerable Bribe to have declared the contrary) by which this stratagem fell to the Ground, tho his Excellency express'd his displeasure against his Mini∣sters of his Admiralty for disappointing him therein; But however they were resolv'd by some means or other to compass their ends; for upon this disappointment, Captain Andrews caus'd the first Libel to be withdrawn, and contrary to the common stile of all such Courts was suffer'd to prefer another, declaring the Ship and Goods to belong to me; but must ne∣vertheless be made a Prize in regard she had not a Pass from some of the Companies Ser∣vants: For the General who declares he has Despotick Power and Sovereign Autho∣rity in his breast would have it so, and his Judges obey'd his Voice; tho it seems their Conscien∣ces gave them a Check whilst they were passing that cruel and unjust Condemnation, by rais∣ing some doubts among them of the Validity of that Reason to confiscate my Estate, which caus'd them to subjoin a Clause to their illegal and errroneous Sentence, declaring that tho the Ship and Goods were now condemn'd as mine, yet if any part thereof should after∣wards appear to belong to the King of Syam or his Subjects it should be condemn'd accord∣ingly; And thus by the depredation begun by Captain Andrews at Mocah, and finish'd by the General's Despotick Power and Sovereign Authority at Bombay, I have had the amount of 7800 l. principal Money most unjustly and violently taken from me; And I am sure I do my self wrong in charging them with no greater Sum than 8000 l. more for the Advance which that Adventure would have render'd me. Nor must I here forget that the Poor Men belonging to my Ship had no better quarter given them for their small matters, for when in most humble manner they petition'd his Excellency the General, that he would be so gracious to Consider 'em for their Wages, and permit 'em to have those few things that belonged to 'em, all they got by it was to hear his Excellency bolt out his Indignation against them in calling them Rebels, and commanding them from his Presence.— I have thus most faithfully and as briefly as I could given a true Account of my present sad Condition, whereby it appears I went to India in a Ship of the Companies, and staid there with leave for which I paid 100 l. and as to my accepting an Employment in the King of Syam's Service, I was not onely introduc'd to it by the Companies Chief and Council at Metchlepatam, but during all the time of my Continuance in that station I held a friendly Correspondence with the President and some of the Chief of their Servants at Fort St. George yearly trading to that Port with my own Shipping which were always kindly receiv'd, and dispatch'd tho they never had any other Passes than my Commissions to the Commanders and Supra Cargo's: and moreover, I was still further confirm'd in my belief that my resi∣dence at Mergen was no way displeasing, by perusal of a kind Letter which the late King was pleas'd to honour my Lord Phaulkon with, wherein he does graciously condescend to acknowledge the great kindness my Lord had shewn his Subjects in that Kingdom, and de∣sires the continuance thereof on assurance of his Royal favour to him in all Occasions.— And after all this when his Command for my leaving that Place and Service, was made known to me by the Proclamation publish'd by Captain Weltden, I obey'd it with all duti∣ful submission. I never shew'd the least disrespect nor did the least prejudice to the Com∣pany, but contrarily was ready on any Occasion to do them the best Services that lay in my Power: yet what by their means I have lost at Mergen and has since been taken from me by their Servants, is of no less value than 40000 l. escaping with my Life in an empty Vessel, wherein I am come to throw my self at the Feet of Justice, and implore relief against the Authors of these Oppressions. Samuel White.
