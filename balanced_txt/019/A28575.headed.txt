Written in French by Monsieur de Boys-Robert, and Translated into English, By W. G. Esq. CONCERNING The excellency of this History, read the Letter of Monsieur du Balzac next after the Preface.

AN ADVICE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL, Which may serve as a Preface to the Reader. ALthough I list to passe here but as a bare Translator of Anaxanders Loves, & Alcidaris Adventures, and to make my self more recommenda∣ble to thee, seek my authority from the Arabians and Indians; I assure my self,
Reader, thou wilt be hardly perswaded that this History is true. However it be, seeing my aim is but to please thee, and with pleasure to divert thee, I care not much whether thou read my Book as a History or Fable, so it do content thee. If I did love to say much, I would easi∣ly prove, that there are in those brave Romances which are after the nature of Epique Poems, instructions fit for all States, that vice may be abhorred, and vertue cherish'd, as well as in Histo∣ries; and, in Romances, so much the more, as he that writes them proposes ever perfection to himself, and sets those vertues in a more eminent de∣gree, whereof examples are presented us by Histories. Besides, there are but few Histories, which do not either lie or flatter, as they forget troublesome truths, they publish lies that do oblige, and commonly discover other mens im∣perfections,
to comply with some ma∣licious minds, and sacrifize to envy: But the composers of Epique Poems, and Romances, are exempt from that black malice and most base complacen∣cy. They describe things not as they are, but as they ought to be; Tis with∣out interest, that they condemn foul deeds, and Treasons, and that they ho∣nor Justice, Wisdome, and Valor. They make the guilty blush in their Consci∣ences, as well as true Historians, and can tell better how, than they, to ani∣mate mens hearts in the defence of right, and reason, even to the last breath of life. Besides, that their design is but to be acceptable, and stir up divers passi∣ons in the Readers, they instruct them nevertheless and edifie them, so as after reading them, they grow much greater friends to vertue than before. As for my self, who cannot brag of those per∣swasive,
moving gifts, I boast at lest, to come thus neer a true History, that I ob∣serve the justness of times, that I de∣scribe exactly the Situation of Coun∣tries, and Regions, and that I relate the customs and ceremonies of the people, at least of such as may give any pleasure to the Readers, estranging my self from such things as may be harsh to their minds, or trouble them. As many as have been in the eastern voyage, & seen the Mogul's Court, who is call'd, great Achebar, of his Subjects, know that of all Asia they are the best men on horse∣back that they are great makers of Car∣rouzels, but that at their publick feasts they mostly use the sports of Fencing. Those who have seen, as well as those that have described the Kingdom of Narsinga, agree all of them, that duels are more used there than in any part of the world; that in times past they have
been condemn'd, and the duellists grie∣vously punished, but that of late years, they were fain to suffer them, hoping by that means to abolish them. What I have said of the nuptials and inter∣ments of their Princes, is confirmed likewise by divers as well antient as modern Historians; So as (Reader) it rests only that I satisfie thee of the time, amnd true race of Tamberlain, from whom I make Anaxander to be de∣scended. Thou shalt know then, (if thou pleas∣est to believe what Albacen an Ara∣bian Historian says, who liv'd in Tamberlains time, and who in two different Volumes hath writ his two childrens lives) that after the death of that great Captain, who was the Prince of Zaguetays son, all his Coun∣tries, which were of a great extent, were divided between the two children San∣tochio,
and Letrochio, and his chief Captains, Axallo, Odmar, Synopes, Colonel of his Infantry, and the Prince of ai his kinsman; that Santo∣chio had for his share, being the dest son, Zaguetay, which was his fathers inheritance, and Letrochio, the youn∣ger, took possession of a good part of the Indes, on this side Ganges A hundred years after Alhacen, another Arabian called Ologbet, who hath written the History of the Kings of Gouzarate, says that Letrochio, Tamberlains son, left his Countries and possessions, to his only son Hmar, who was able to preserve Cambaya only, by reason his other Subjects revolted from his o∣bedience. This Hamar had divers children, of whom the eldest was called Alagmet, who died very young, and from the second, called Abduli, came the great Alcidaris, the father of Al∣cidaris
and Anaxander, which he had by two wives. He was surnamed the great, because he had done many memo∣rable actions from his youth up, chastis'd many of his rebel Subjects, having o∣vercome them in sundry Battels, and re∣covered much Land, and many Pro∣vinces which had been taken from his father Hamar; among others the King∣dom of Candahar, otherwise called Sa∣blestan, situate on the North of the Kingdom of Cabul, and that of Man∣doa, situate between the Kingdoms of Cambaya, and Cytor. Neverthelesse he left the enjoyment of them to King Babor, he paying the accustomed Tri∣bute imposed on him by his ancestors. This Babor had one only daughter cal∣led Berenica, whom Alcidaris marri∣ed, from her came the young Alcidaris; and our Anaxander came from A∣naxarette Queen of Dulcinda. These
two brothers being well united, regained by their valour in time, whatsoever Hamar had lost, and conquered a part of those countries, possessed this day by the great Mogul, who boasheth to be the sole remainder of their race: But I de∣scribe their Loves only and their first adventures, purposing to do some better thing hereafter, if I understand, Reader, that this little work hath pleased thee. And now I intreat thee, not to blame me for sundry faults escaped by misfortune in the impression; I have corrected such as have come to my knowledge, and if I have been so happy as to have stolen some importunate hours from thee, I crave no other reward, but that thou wilt amend what I have not ob∣served Farewell.
A letter written by Monsieur du Balzac, To a Lady of quality, accompanied with the Indian History of Anaxander and Ora∣zia. Madam, BEing not able to wait on you according to my promise, when you went from hence; I believe, I shall not do you injury, if I commend you better company. Tis that book I send you, which you heard so much prais'd, and which, you thought to carry with you into those parts, for a comfort in your ab∣sence from the Court. It is certainly worth your estimation, and as great impatience, as I knew you did expect it with. And, if in times past, the belly of a Queen from whence a Prince was to be born, us'd to be crown'd, I wonder not, that you, before the birth thereof approv'd it. 'Twill without doubt, rellish a∣gain your palate, which those ill lines of mine, you have sometimes made me send you, have much distasted. It will afford you where∣withall, to shorten the longest daies, even of this season; and means, to entertain your
self lone, and reason too, to thank me for my abence. For, to speak truth, all visits, will be uneasie to you, during so sweet diversion, as so fine a lecture hath prepared for you, and whoever shall disturb you in it, must un∣doubtedly receive your secret cuse, whatever complements good manners may oblige you to make shew of. For me, Madam, who will have me be∣lieve, my judgment not extremely ill, and that my opinions are sound enough, I must confesse, that laying aside the love I bear the Author of this work, I have observed many things therein, which I would praise even in my enemy. He will pardon me, if I tell you, he is one of the most acceptable liars I yet e∣ver saw; and it is very certain, that I never complained of his cheats, till he had done de∣ceiving me, because they lasted no longer. I will not conceal my weaknesse: I knew I saw the picture of a feigned thing, and yet I felt as violent motions, as the thing real would have stirred in me, if it had been true, and that I had beheld it with mine own eyes. sometimes I was sorry, and sometimes glad, as Monsieur de Boys-Robert was pleas'd to tell me, of good or ill fortune: me though, I was in earnest interested in the affairs of his imaginary Kings; I had many fears for poor
Anaxander, which are beyond expression: and Lisimantus misfortunes, very littleless troubled my mind, and in the very extremi∣ties I saw them both, I offered vows for their safety, at the instant, when they were deli∣vered miraculously. In fine, Madam, al∣though my heart be reasonably hard, and my eyes, not very inclinable to water, some tears fell from me, in spite of my teeth, and I was asham'd that they were another mans dreams, and visions, which mov'd me to so feeling and so real sorrows, and not my own e∣vils. It is a most tyrannial power, which a mans sense usurps over his reason, and which manifestly shews us, that the neighbourhood of the imagination, is extrmely contagious to the parts intellectual, and that that proud creature, which thinks  made to com∣mand all others, consists of a great deal more body, than soul. The Author of the Ethiopi∣an History gave me many times such frights, and I cannot at this day read him, but with being deceiv'd. As for other Romances, you know I am not greedy of them; and indeed, the greatest part are  Heliodorus's dis∣guis'd, or as the late ishop of Ayre said, of the children that came to Theagenes and Carileas Marriage, who so exactly resent∣bled their father and mother, as not a hair
difference. I promise you Madam, you shall here see what is new, and the Courts true tongue speak, of which, you have so perfect a knowledge. I confesse somewhat there is, in some places, a little like roesie, and not en∣tirely according to the strictnesse of our rules; But I am told, that those kinde of beauties be∣come Romances, and that all that manner of writing is without the reach of our jurisdi∣ction. Before I shut up my letter I have some∣thing pleasant to tell you of, &c.

THE INDIAN HISTORY OF ANAXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The first BOOK. As soon as the sad knowledge of A∣rontus death, arrived at Baticalus, where the King but late retired, to enjoy the fruits of Lisimantus Vi∣ctorie, who had regained from his Enemies the Countrey of Canara; As soon, I say, as that sad noise had run through∣out the City, all Sports and Passe-times ceast, and their triumphant Tunes were chang'd to woefull
Moanes, and the unlook'd-for mourning which the Court put on, spred suddainly thorowout the Kingdome of Narsinga, which, in that youth∣full Prince, had loft the flower of all their hopes. This sorrow was so universall, and this loss so generally felt, that any man seem'd guilty, with∣out tears, and none did dare, although in publick, to keep in his sorrow, for fear of being judg'd persidious, or a Traytor. But the fair Orazia, more than all, with grief unspeakable, receiv'd the knowledge of that loss; and though her self obtain'd thereby three King∣doms, she could not yet endure the everlasting se∣peration from that only brother whom she so ten∣derly had loved, and of whose dear regards of her, she had so great assurances; Her beauteous mouth, which through excess of love, had caused all the world to sigh, sigh'd now its self through her ex∣cess of sorrow; her lovely eyes, which common∣ly were call'd the living Fountains of the Graces, and of Loves, were now, but lasting springs of ever-flowing tears. And though she strove her ut∣most, to destroy that beauty, by the clouds she dai∣ly cast upon them, yet did they not forbear to send their beams abroad, and shine with equall force, as does the Sun, sometimes betwixt two showers. The Princess Lisimena, whose society, but late∣ly was so sweet, and acceptable to her, and in whose bosome she was wont to lock in safety, her displeasures, and delights, grew now uncapable of serving her with any consolation, nay, to speak truth, her self much needed it.
This Goodly Princess, whom late incensed war, within the King her Fathers Country of ey∣lan, had drawn into those parts, shar'd greatly in the common sorrow of the Kingdome, which was then her sanctuary, and seem'd as much afflicted, as if her Father had been spoyl'd of all his Coun∣tries; whom formne, and the valour of Lisiman∣tus had made victorious over the King of Mal∣dives, and who had  his Empire over all his enemies possessions: Lasimena (I say) forgot the pleasures of these Conqueslis, and only would remember that great loss; so late received in that Country, which she loved equall with her own, although she had not had an obligation, by the Laws of nature, and of blood. Now, as she never fail'd from alwayes being with Orazia, to assist in the contrivances of new Pastimes, far was it from her thoughts, to leave her in the woefull case, whereto this new mis-for∣tune had reduced her: But how was their enter∣tainment now altered from thier former conver∣sation? for, whereas they were wont to breath, no other thing, than sweetness, and content, they now could nothing else but mix confusedly their tears, and sighs, not able to speak a word. Thus, in embraces they were found, when Sa∣radin, Arontus faithfull squire, with a counte∣nance bearing deaths picture in it, entred the Princess Chamber, and kneeling, said, Madam, behold the first time, ever I unwillingly observ'd my Masters commands; and surely I obey him now in this last service, in duty to a sorrowfull Commission: and saying this, he from his pocket
drew a handkerchief to wipe his tears, which ran about his face abundantly, and in his other hand, holding a Letter sealed with Aron∣tus Signet, Madam (said he) see the last re∣liques of that generous Prince, which made all India tremble at him; dying, he ever named you, and when he saw Physicians left him, having but two houres time to live, he spent that space to let you see his last desires, under his dying hand, in this short letter, which he wanted strength to fi∣nish: yet, had he care, to have it sealed in his pre∣sence, whiles he lived, and among all his people, who lamented him about his bed, within his Tent, he chose out me, and thus said to me; Sa∣radin, as soon as mine eyes close, go to my Sister, and tell her she observe what I advise her by this Letter, which thou shalt trust no other hand with, than her own; scarce had he said these words, but that his soul followed them, and took its flight to heaven. The fair Orazia, who had not need of this addition to her sorrow, had notwithstanding re∣solution enough to open the letter, which she re∣ceived from the faithfull squire: But yet her tears which choak'd her eyes, gave her not leave so soon to see that it contain'd these words.
Arontus Letter to Orazia. MY deer Sister, the little time I have to live, I spend in teaching thee to bear my death with comfort. I pray thee trouble not thy self, because it could not be more glori∣ous, for it has succeeded the destruction of our enemies, whom I have over-thrown in battell. The only grief I have in dying, is, that I can∣not with my person, clear a truth unto you, which is needfull you should know. Those accomplish'd Knights, who under names of Ariomant, and Calistenus have so long aisguis'd themselves among us, are two of the most renowned Princess of Asia; and I conjure thee to observe the Gods intention, and thy Brothers last will, which do ordain the first of them, to be thy husband: he is the son of great Al— The poor Prince would have said Alidaris, King of Cambaye, and Father to the generous A∣naxander, whose qualities, and manners he in∣tended to describe, if so his hand had power to second his desire: but strength upon a sud∣dain fayling him, by reason of his mortall wounds received, he was constrained to leave unperfected his Letter, and in his pre∣sence have it sealed as it was, to keep his promise, given the Prince Anaxander, and his Cousin P∣roxenus,
that he would never make them known, but to his Sister Orazia, nor make their birth apparent, till they were fit, to shew themselves, in Princes equipage, before the King of Nar∣singa. This letter did redouble her affliction, and a∣mong the violent touches of her sorrow, waked her amourous dislurbances. After she had a thou∣sand times accused the heavens, and curs'd Aron∣tus fatall victory, which cost his life; comming at length, to cast her eyes upon the notice he had given her in his Letter, (admire the force and power of love) a suddain alteration surprised her, and mov'd her thoughts from the sad mourning of her brother, to reflect upon her Lover. She alwayes had opinion, that Ariomant, whose acti∣ons were so Kingly, must be of eminent quality; and notwithstanding his so humble fashion in the King her Fathers Court, she knew, that in his eyes and Courage, there was somewhat great and fa∣mous. But at that instant, she receiv'd so glorious a testimony of his birth, she neither could disguise apprehension, nor dissemble from Lisimenaes eyes, the passion she was in, to be more fully satisfied; For which cause, drawing Saradin apart, My friend (said she) to him, since the misfortune hapned to us by thy Masters loss, hat testimony hath Ariamont given, who now commands the Army: Madam, answered Saradin, since that wo∣full day, where in the Prince, forced to leave us, gave him the guidance of our Troops, he hath so worthily discharg'd himself, that though he be a
stranger, and known by nothing but his actions, he hath not purchased the smallest jealousie; all our Captains, with delight obey him, and though the Prince had not himself appointed him as chief, I think he had been chosen by the Armies generall consent. His wisdom and his valour are so met, and so full of every vertue sit to make up a com∣mander, that if there be any thing, which may ad∣minister a comfort to us, in this dire mischance, it is, to see our Prince his power hath fallen in∣to so noble hands. The Princess receiv'd a two-fold mitigation of her sorrow, when she learnt that he, to whom she had already given her heart, not knowing his descent, was not alone a Prince by birth, but that his reputation was so great, and universally ad∣mired by all the King her Fathers subjects, as that she saw fair likely-hoods, of good success unto her loves. The only curiosity she had to know his paren∣tage, and over what people he commanded, did yet keep her unsatisfied; and gathering by Sara∣dins discourse, that in the Army, he was not held for what he was, she guest there was some reason, why he publish'd not himself, and that she could not know the truth thereof, except himself did tell it her. This was the reason why, among so many other questions ask'd of Saradin, she enquired of him, whether his return would not be shortly. Madam, answered the faithfull squire, as soon as he shll have conquered that rest of the Kingdom of De∣can, which had been made a prey unto those two
revolted slaves, whom we have punished, and overthrown in battell, he will bring back the victorious army, which as you know have decreed sacred honours to my Master, whose pretious body embalmed, will be with∣in a few dayes conducted hither, drawn in a triumphant Chariot, which shall accompa∣ny his pompous funerals. It cannot be long ere they returne; for the Decanians ravi∣shed with joy to be delivered from two slaves, who have driven out all their blood Royall from their government, came every day to yeeld themselves unto the valiant A∣riomant, and bring him still their City keyes, and Castles likewise. And that poor people, incapable of defending themselves, with plea∣sure rank them under the Kings dominion, whose clemency they know, as surely as his justice. The fair Orazia not able at that time to learn more newes, of her deer Ariomant, with much impatience look'd for his return, and still she sought her common comforts from Lisimena, from whom she could not hide the new occasions of her joy, nor yet conceal her Lovers birth, which from her Brothers Letter (which the Gods would not allow an end to,) she began to know; But she con∣jur'd her, she should keep it secret, and make no mention of it till a fitter season. Mean while, for her diversions, and to beguile the time of Ariomants absence, she of∣ten talked with Saradin, and made him re∣peat
the prayses, which she already had ta∣sted, with so much content in his behalf, whom more than all the world she lov'd. And because she would make Saradin entire∣ly hers, whose faithfulnesse she knew unpara∣llel'd, her chief squire being slain in the battell, she chose Saradin to succeed him, to which, she got the King her Fathers con∣sent, who was much pleas'd to give him that reward, as worthy of his long good services. If hitherto, I have not spoken of that great Monarchs sorrow, and excessive grief, for losse of his dear son, upon whose magnanimity, and valour, he had built his rest, and hopes, 'tis to speak truly, that I hold his woes unspeakable; Besides, in telling you the little strength he had to meet that unexpected newes, and the despair which more than once had tempted him to do violence on himself, I fear to lay a blemish on the other actions of his life. Let us forget his sorrows, and his over-passion then, and call to mind the constancy wherewith he shortly after arm'd him∣self, and resolution which he took, to honour, (as his army had desir'd) his deer Arontus memory, and funerals. He alwayes kept the brave Lisimantus with him, and so much valued the courage of that invincible Knight, as that he dar'd not in his presence shew his great resentments; and truly 'twas from him, he had more comfort than from any other, being a man, who had despis'd a thousand deaths; and one, who though his life
were glorious for a thousand brave exploits, yet found no sweetness in it, for the bloody discou∣tentments he each day received in the scorn of beautious Lisimena. But whiles accommodations are preparing to solemnize the funerall pomps of that Prince whom they expect, and whose body, glorious though without a soul, craves the honour of a triumph, 'tis requisite, that by the way, I tell you somewhat of this Lisimantus, who for his vertue, merits in this place, to have a short abridgement of his life recorded. He was a Souldier under fortunes banner, who from his infancy being given a Page unto the Princess Lisimena, and after given again unto the King of Zeilan her father, as you shal see in the se∣quell of this story, from step to step advanc'd him by his courage, and by his excellent conduct rose to the greatest charges in the Kingdom; and so far forth, as after Arbiran's death, he followed him, and was made generall of that great Army, which hath of late triumphed over the King of Maldives. All the Indian Chronicles are full of memorable actions, by him done in that long war; and you shall by and by learn from his own mouth, the reason why, to take upon him the name of Lisi∣mantus, he forsook his own, a name he borrowed from the King his Masters only daughter, to whom from his first rising he was bold to send sighs, and amorous aspects. The fair Lisimena (so was the Princess cald,) besides a private inclination which she had to cherish that accomplisht Knight, for his own me∣rits
sake, did yet besides account her self oblig'd thereto, for great and noted services, which every day he did unto the Crown of Zeilan, whose chief support, and prop he was: but the great courage of her heart, and honour, which she valued more than all things else, caused her to undervalue in her thoughts, the secret love of that unknown young man, whom she had seen to come so poor∣ly fitted to the King her Fathers Court, who knew no more than she, his birth, and could not enough wonder at the boldness which he took, not only to send forth his looks towards her, but even to sigh in presence of her, whiles the whole Court saw and knew it; because it was a Law throughout the Indes, that a Princess could not marry but her equall, nor without much disho∣nour, suffer the addresses of a man, who were not Kingly born. And in some parts the Law was more severe than others, as in the Kingdome of Decan, where death was added to the shame of that Princess, who should unequally dispose her self. Which is at present yet the Custom among the Negres as well of the Kingdome of Cambaye, as Calecut, and all the parts of Malabar. Not one however dar'd to speak his thoughts of Lisimantus open love, envy it self was silent, as well for that they knew the greatness of his humour, as the re∣spect which they were bound to owe the power of his command, wherein he did so worthily ac∣quit himself. The King observed him as well as others, but that his wisdome did oblige him to distemble what he saw, because in truth he was very neces∣sary,
as the chiefest instrument of that revenge he had ordained for his greatest enemy, the King of Maldives, who had for wantonnesse assaulted him, and sworn his ruin; But for fear of causing greater passion which he daily saw to grow in Li∣simantus, it seem'd him best to separate his daughter for some time, and send her to his bro∣thers in Law, and friend, the King of Narsingus Court, to keep her Cousin Orazia company. He wanted not a colour for this act, for they had lately understood by an intelligencer, that the King of Maldives who was then lately beaten in two sea fights by Lisimantus, made great prepara∣tion, to besiege the City of Colombo, where the King of Zeilan commonly held his Court, and he conceiv'd he should have lesse cause to fear, when as his daughter who was the greatest treasure that he had, (though in his Countries Pearl, and Eme∣raulds & Saphires are found aboundantly) should remain in safety. This resolution he no sooner took but put in execution, and sent his only daughter (who long since lost her Mother) to Narsinga, with an equi∣page which well became her greatnesse. Lisimantus would most gladly have diverted that voyage, had he dared, and had opposed his courage to the Kings fear, if that he should not have too openly declared himself, and with inso∣lency abused the prosperity of his fortune and his Armes; this made him hide his discontent, and yeelding to necessity, permitted her to go away, who had fomented still his courage, and was cause of all the goodly actions he had done.
It was indeed the King of Maldives project, to besiege the City of Colombo, that in some sort he might repair his severall assronts, receiv'd in many Sea fights: But by the impatient courage of Lisimantus, he was prevented, who sin∣ding they were slow in comming, and percei∣ving how the King his Masters Forces were augmented by the late ayd sent by the King of Narsinga his Brother in Law, thought sit to pre∣vent the enemy, and go lay battery to Bandos, his chiefest fortresse, which was not far from the Isle of Male, where then he made his war-like provisions. And that which put him upon the enterprize, was, that he had intelligence within the place; he proposed it to the councill of warre, who approv'd thereof, and was so happy, as his plot succeeded for the King his Masters advantage; he took that Castle under the King of Maldives nose, who was come to succour it, sunck divers of his great ships, and in a word, to finish all his victories, he defea∣ted absolutely the King of Maldives, who fled in∣to the farthest parts of the Isles of Palandurus; he got all his Countries, wherewith he enlarged his Masters, and did such notable things, and worthy of admiration, as will never be forgotten, as you shall more at large perceive in the fifth Book of this History; for I mean now to tell you only, what adventures brought him to the City of Baticalus. No sooner was he return'd victorious into the Island of Zeilan, but the King had notice, that the two revolted slaves, the faithlesse Rozalcan
and his Brother Zabain, who had usurp'd the Kingdome of Decan, and driven out of all their lawfull Princes, not contented with the Signiories of those twelve mighty Provinces, would yet aug∣ment themselves, at the charges of the King of Narsinga, from whom, already they had taken the Country of Canara which bordered on them, and lay convenient for their purpose. As soon as the King of Zeilan knew hereof, having no more to fear now from the King of Maldives, whose pride was well abated, though nothing more than how to succour and revenge his friend, his neighbour, and allie, the King of Narsinga, to whom he sent back his Troops, adding as many of his own subjects, under the conduct of Lisimantus, whose service by the same occasion he presented him, if in the present necessity of his affairs he thought him needfull. You may imagine if our Heros, who did seek but new occasion, to employ his courage in, was very glad to find it in a place, where he was sure to see the sweetest object of his thoughts, he did not run, he flew unto it, and being arriv'd at Bis∣nagar, where then the King of Narsinga was, he had the honour to divide the Royall Army, with the Prince Arontus, only heir to those great King∣doms, of Narsinga, Bisnagar, and of Orixa; But Arontus, as great reason was, did choose, and took the greatest and the hardest task to undergo. Lisimantus then, with those Troops which he brought out of Zeilan, were sent to re-obtain the Country of Canara from the enemies, and the Prince Arontus led his Army into the Kingdome
of Decan, resolving to root out those two slaves, which had revolted from their Prince, and caus'd so many, and so divers mischiefs; he therein bore himself so bravely, that having met them in the field, and with the pride of all their Army, he gave them battail, he slew Zabain with his own hand, and aided by the valour of Ariomont and Callistenus, had so glorious a success, as that he rooted out those Monsters, of whom, the one as I have said, with his own hand he slew; but from the other had his mortall wound, who was then presently tane prisoner, & by and by, shall serve to adorn the Funerall Triumph of that Prince, falln in his victory, and whom to sorrow for, we begun already. Before those passags in Decan, Lisimantus had already done so well his duty, as he regain'd the Province of Canara, so famous for those three Ci∣ties, Onor, Mangalor, and Baticalus; and after he had put to death, or banisht far enough from thence, all those who had been constant to those slaves, who faith-less had oppos'd themselves a∣gainst his power, he sent a post to give knowledge of it to the King of Narsinga; which when he understood, as well because he would enjoy the fruits of that valiant Cavaliers victory, as for his neer being to Decan, and sooner having advertise∣ments from his Son, he left the great City of Bisna∣gar, & removed his whole Court to Baticalus, wich heretofore had been the antient burying place of the first Kings of Narsinga, when they aboad in the Country of Canara, and shall serve shortly in the same stead unto the generous Arontus.
There 'twas, that Lisimantus saw again the dea∣rest object of his passion, there 'twas that all his great desires awaked, and where he thought, ha∣ving orecome his enemies, he should obtain fair Lisimena; But, though that beautious Princess knew sufficiently Lisimantus merits, and was not ignorant of one of all those services he did her Fa∣ther, the evill relish of his petty birth, diverted her from loving him, and from his conversation too, for fear lest those perfections which she no∣ted in his mind and body, might at length gain on her, and light a fire, which was already kindling in her heart, which then she might not know to quench. The fair Orazia knew all the secrets of her soul, as she had likewise opened hers to Lisimena, and whiles each entertained other with their a∣morous resentments, there came a Post from the King of Zeilan, who crav'd again his daughter, and pray'd the King of Narsinga, to send her back, because there was no stir or trouble now within his Countries: But this news greatly grie∣ved Orazia, who was like to lose, and may be, lose for ever that deer Princess, unto whom, be∣sides so neer a bloud, so great and perfect friend∣ship had united her. However, little was that sorrow, to another which befell her shortly after, by the arivall of a Post come from Decan, who as I said, brought her the wofull newes of her only brother, Arontus death. But, for we have alrea∣dy mentioned the honours meant unto him, al∣though dead, and the provisions fitted for his tri∣umph; Let us go on in our story, and renew no
more, the plaints, and griefs, which but too oft already, I have for a losse so generall, repeated. Scarce had a Month been spent since that sad news had entred Baticalus, when a Post from A∣riomant came to the King, to give him notice of his Victorious Armies coming home, which wai∣ted on the glorious body of his Son: Immedi∣ately that valiant King, forgetting or dissembling his inward sorrow, caus'd the stately sumptuous Convoy to be fitted, which, by night, and with this ceremony, passed from the gate of the great street of Baticalus, to the Royal Palace. First, the whole street was spread with black Velvet, and at each window burnt six Torches (throughout every story) of Virgin wax, to shew the pomp of that Solemnity. All the Souldiers, who in that War had followed him, past File and File, in streaming tears, trayling their Pikes upon the ground, as conquer'd people, rather than victorious; their brazen Drums in mourning cases, beat but now, and then, and gave a certain doleful sound, which mov'd new horror in the people; when as the Foot companies, (which were a great number,) had all pass'd by, the Cavalry in Sable Armes ap∣peared, their horse Caparisons of the same co∣lour, having the fights of their Helmets down, and holding but the shivers of Lances in their hands; their Trumpets, but half blown, sent forth most lamentable sounds or rather cries, which now made melt the hearts of those, who formerly they had encouraged; next them, came Ariomant, who really afflicted, hid not his face,
as did the rest, but in his eyes would have them see the sadness of his heart, and in this sorrowful appearance he did seem so handsome, that Orazi∣a, who observ'd him passing by, was doubly (but for divers causes) moved, by his tears; al∣listenus, was by his side, who nothing differ'd from him, save that his Sable plume was not so long as his; the Chariot followed them close af∣ter, which drawn by six black horses, carried the Cypres smelling Coffin, where lay; the body of A∣rontus, and over it, his Image fixt, in Kingly rober, holding his Scepter in his hand. Rosalon was on his knees, chain'd at the feet of this Effi∣gies, who looked in his face, and round about him, there marched in much pain, by reason of their chaines, the chief of those who had rebel∣led, and Trayterous Villains to their King, had taken party with a pair of Slaves. Before the pillar of the Chariot, there hung, as Trophies, every piece of the Princes Armour, from head to foot, and at the hinder pillars were made fast some of the Ensigns and the Warlike spoyls, which he had gotten from the two Usurpers, and what the Chariot could not carry, were borne on Elephants, which follow'd them, in coverings of black Velvet. In this glorious, and mournful equipage, A∣rontus body was carried as far as the Temple of the Royal Palace, which was the ancient place of burying their Kings. There had they rais'd a stately Altar, on which was set the Image of the Prince, exceeding like him, which they honored with Persumes, and lighted Lamps were plac'd
about it; And, that according to the ancient cu∣stom, that ceremony, might last for ever, a yearly sum was settled, and people appointed, who with great molten Censers, almost like those where∣with they worshipped the gods, should still per∣sume that Image, and see that everlastingly those Lamps should burn; at the feet of the Effigies, was set this inscription in Arabique verses, which I have in our language thus translated. In thickest of my Victory, When my strong arm, in honor high Did strew their Camp, with dread, and fear, Twice wounded, by two deadly darts, Triumphing ore the rebels hearts, Death, did his triumphs on me rear. As soon as they were gone forth from the Tem∣ple, Rosalcan, whom the Executioners had sea∣zed, by the Kings command, had his head struck off at the gate, and was slain as a sacrifice unto the Princes Guardian Angels. When all the Funeral ceremonies were ended, and the great sorrow overpast, the King, who had a manlike heart, diverting by degrees his trouble, sought comfort in the great perfections of his Daughter, which was left him, the rare Orarza, who, gaining every day, new charmes from the return her of deerest Lover, grew a continual ob∣ject of delight, to all that saw her; her beautious face, shining, within that great and obscure Veil, had more force, than when the Sun bursts through the cloud, which in foul weather environ it:
Love never leaves her eyes, in greatest sadness, nor in her strictest mourning do her graces ever quit her. Before the Kings departure from Baticalus, he made provision for disorders in the Kingdom, and chiefly to restrain the liberty, of private Com∣bates, which the War had lately very much re∣new'd among his brave Nobility. Indeed, they gave too great a way, unto that brute, and bound∣less fury, and thereby too much wrong'd their courage, which exalted them above all other Nations far: For preventing therefore anew, the progresse of this mischief, which from day to day got strength, the Councill was assembled, and the King ordained a Law severe, whereby, without exception, of or rank, or quality whate∣ver, it was decree'd, that the infringers should unpardonably passe the Hangmans hands, and have their heads struck off, besides the losse of offices, and goods, which should remain confis∣cate to the King, and that the execution might be sure, and that all hope of favour for the future might be clean taken away, his Majesty swore solemnly, before the Altars, on the sacred Books, and by his Fathers soul, to make due execution of it; nor that his Son, if yet alive, should have ex∣emption from the Law, if he should give himself to that inhumane course, and thereby run the ha∣zard of it. This strict Ordinance, repress'd exceedingly the fierceness of that ready youth, who were com∣pelled to hide their often resentments after inju∣ries received, and restrained their too too heady
forwardness, wherein, so indiscreetly they had laid the chiefest point of honor. When as suffici∣ent provision had been made for this disorder, and, that the King, had, for the good, and quiet of his people, settled other wholsome Laws, and strengthned all the Holds of Canara, with faith∣ful Governors, and meet provisions, he com∣manded all manner of Carriages, and Wagons to be ready, for that within eight daies, he would depart from Baticalus; and for more acceptation to the King of Zeylan, who desir'd his Daughter, he meant to wait on her himself unto the neerest Port for her conveniency, with which advertise∣ment he bid the Post return unto the King his Master. This resolution of the Kings, pleased greatly Lisimantus, who being to be chief of that Con∣duct meaned to declare himself upon the way, and let Lisimena know, (who saw too much al∣ready) his great passion so her love. In Batica∣lus he had never opportunity to speak in private to her, though for that end, he had imployed his subtilest contrivances, and so far forth, as what by gifts and flattering, he had won a little Page of hers, call'd Aquilant, whom she much loved, and was ever of her train; with him he had the boldness to trust a Letter, which contained his secret Loves, and told him, twas an intelligence that much concern'd his Mistresse service, and that he should not fail, to be careful in the deli∣very, without telling her from whence it came, for that she would her self finde well enough, and that undoubtedly, she would think much the bet∣ter
of him; This little innocent, gave indeed the paper to Lisimena, who verily thinking it to be some notice which concerned her good, or else the King her fathers, immediately opened it, and was amaz'd to finde what followeth written in it. Lisimantus Letter to Lisimena. Madame, I Know that instantly you will accuse my rashness, and condemn as guilty my desires; because twas never heard, and chiefly in this Country, that a Subject, should presume to speak unto his Princesse, openly of Love; But come what may, and whatsoever evill be pre∣pared for me, I am forc'd to yield unto the motions of my soul, and make my hands as guilty; by those lines, as are mine eyes, who have already taken boldnesse, to declare my passion to you. If from the gods, I have recei∣ved any merit, which may cause you to endure, and not reject the Love I make you; I conjure you Madam, not to stick upon your Country Laws, for they concern not me, in punishing unequal Marriages, having (however mean I am esteem'd to be) enough to make me by my courage, and my glorious enterprizes equal to the greatest Kings; Tis true, I think not Ma∣dam, that I am descended from a Kingly
parentage, nor can I shew the titles of my fa∣mily, in ancient characters of graven Mar∣ble; but, since my loves necessity, compels me to a little vaunt; to make up by my actions, what I want in birth, I mean to draw some luster from my proper vertue, and am glader far, to ow my glory to my Sword, than to my Grandires merits. Yet though I might be a∣ble to reckon Kings among my ancestors, I had rather much, be estimable for the number I had overcome, than even from those I should derive my self extracted; And since the gods have deign'd so great a favour to my armes, as to enlarge the King your fathers Coun∣tries, and root out his Enemies, why should I fear, to promise other Conquests to my self herafter? Is there so hard a Victory to get, which that I may be worthy of your Love, I will not undertake? And if at most it be, that for your husband, you desire a King, bid me depose the mightiest of all Asia, that, with that title I may have the honor to pos∣sesse you, and may finde, no other obstacle to my ambition. Lisimena was marvellously surprised at this Letter, and exceedingly chid the little Aquilant, forbidding him, for ever after upon pain of being turn'd away, to have to do with Lisimantus mat∣ters.
Notwithstanding, whatever resolutiō she had taken, to dissemble, & conceal the trouble, which this accomplish'd knights affection caused her, she could not chuse but tell her other self, her deer O∣razia, each particular, being perswaded, for so much she lov'd her, and so sure belief had of her, that though she told her all, she never would let out one secret from her heart. My sister (said she) for so they called each other;) what reasō is there I should give my self to love a subject, who, even himself seems to confesse the poverty of his de∣scent, & is guilty of such meanness, as never yet to any body, would he declare the place where he was born; yet I cannot hate him, for he is too lovely qualifi'd; your self can testifie, of some of his good actions; &, as I think, I should both trespasse on my honor, & our Laws, to shew consent to his intreaties; so should I anger Love, if absolutely, I should scorn them. What shall I do my deer sister, in these two extremitie, wherewith I am so e∣qually pressed? I intreat you to give me such counsel, as your self would accept, provided it be built on honor, which I never mean to violate. Orazia, who but lately had the same resent∣ments for her Ariomant, whilst his condition was unknown unto her, and who knew that Love does not consider qualities; or set a difference be∣tween parties, was in as much trouble as Lisimena, to flatter her passion without offending her, or herself; for her own ends, forbad her to advise for a Lisimenaes dvantage, in the impatient and extream desire she had, to procure that Ariomant might secretly come to her, to be satisfied from
his own mouth, touching the Story of his life, and the whole truth of his original; which be∣ing not possible, without the knowledge of Lisi∣mena, who day nor night was absent from her, she thought, that if Lisimantus should have access to his Princess, at those times when she should have a mind to entertain her Lover, besides that Ariomant would never yield to make himself known before so many people, there would be likewise too many witnesses, unto a matter, which was as yet not time to be reveal'd to any body; all these considerations, caus'd her to insist upon the un∣happy quality of a subject, and to tell Lisimena, that though her Lover, so vertuous, and accom∣plish'd as he was, being a subject to the King her father, and the meanness of his birth but too too sure; she should do her self great wrong to speak with him in private, and to allow his open Love; she wisht her, to have a little patience, seeing her honor was more deer unto her than his love, and it may be Lisimantus great achievements would so touch the King, who had already spied his a∣morous inclination, as that he voluntarily might give him his succession, by making her his wife. See here how Orazia diverted Lisimena from the desire to which she exceedingly enclined, to admit, and talk with Lisimantus, who was as beautiful, as bold, and being no lesse eloquent, than valiant, had doubtlessely, at first dash, greatly shaken this Princesses resolution. Lets leave her then in her concealed trouble, and likewise the sad memory, of all the anguish, caused by Arontus death, and turn us to our Lovers joy, who with a
alike desire, seek how to meet again, and burn with one impatience. Ariomant knew nothing of the care, which poor Arontus had, lying a dying, to advertise his sister of his high descent; and meaning with his deer friend Callistenus to retuan into Cambaye, that suddainly they might come back in Princes equipage, and consummate their faithful Loves; he laboured to receive the fair Orazia's com∣mands, and meant before he went, to tell her secretly, his great extraction, that as yet he might be more acceptable unto her, and more worthy of her favours, which he had already but too much a acquir'd, when Saradin the Princesse new Squire, to whom she had given trust of all her secrets, came to him from her, and said as follows, to his no lesse great astonishment, than Joy. Illustrious Ariomant (said he,) without Ma∣gick, I can tell the trouble you are in; and have no other errant, than to help you out; I know you labour to be private with the Princesse; and what say you, if she desire it too, and if already knowing by Divine revelation part of your great∣ness, she have sent me to you, to entreat your company, as soon as may be, and to hear the story of your life, and matters, which but from your self she cannot learn. Wonder not Sir, said he; you have seen me formerly a servant to Arontus, and my long, and known fidelity in several affairs, has made me acceptable to the Princesse, who hath done me the honor to think me fit to exercise an office in her house, which by the death of her
chief Squire, fell vacant; besides, she hath thought fit to open me her heart, and tell me how she loves you, which she hath Inherited, from her Brother, who so dearly tendred you; come go with me if you desire to know more; for I am only charged to bring you where she is, and have detain'd you with my past discourse, that you might only trust my faith and word. Sure Ariomants passion must have been extream, seeing his heart, which till that time seemed in∣sensible, or at least ordinary in its joy, appeared now a long time in his countenance disordered by the alteration which that pleasing news had caused in him; we may from thence collect, that Love is the most tickling, and delicate, of all the motions of the soul; for commonly, the greatest courages, are most indifferent to every other joy, than those, which come from the successes of their Loves. When our brave Heroe, was recovered from his transport, he thank'd the faithful Saradin, for having by his care delivered him from so great trouble, and follow'd him alone, without the least distrust, unto the little Garden of Fountains, where the amorous Princesse did expect him. The Sun already had been set, an hour, or more, and the Moon, being about the Full, without offence of any Cloud, began to shine, when the fair Orazia as wel to take the free con∣tentment, of the freshness, of so fair, and clear, a night, as without hinderance, to give access unto her Lover, walked alone, save with the Princess of Zeilan, in the little Garden which ac∣companied
their neighbouring privacies, and which was common to them both, wherein they had forbidden any body to be seen. Although she with impatience look'd for Ariomant, she could not choose but be surprised at his com∣ming; she stay'd her in a verdant Parlor, and dewed with a Christall Fountain, which being plac'd against the wall, ran out into the City; for there it was that Saradin must bring him in, for fear least in the walk, some of the Princess houshold might discover him, because their windows lookt into the Garden. No sooner had that lovely Prince appeared to her eyes, by whom he was as much beloved, as he loved, but Love and Joy transporting him, he kneel'd, and after having kist her hand: Ma∣dam said he, is it possible, that you have thought me worthy of so great a happiness, and glory: hold me no longer in suspence, tell me, ah tell me, if my eyes deceive me, or whether it be a reall act of my good fortune, which presents me to you. His wonder did not so much blind him, but he knew his duty towards Lisimena; where∣fore he rose immediatly to give her salutations, with as great civility, as gracefulness, before he thus was answered by Orazia. Most generous Prince, said she, you can no longer hide you from me, The gods have granted me discovery of part of your illustrious birth; and surely, being as you are, the real proofs you shall here receive of my af∣fection, & esteem, wil be but much below your me∣rit; do not, I pray you therefore feign, (before this Princess, whose perfect union with me, gives us
both but one desire,) to tell me that, at full, which but in part, has yet arriv'd my knowledge. Tell me of all the fortunes you have ran, before your comming hither, and above all, conceal not from me, the chief cause, that guided you, into these parts. Madam, replyed Ariomant, since for the glo∣ry of us mortals, you are here below, and since you are by all acknowledg'd, for a most visible divinity on earth, I cannot wonder at your knowledge of me. Goddesses, cannot be igno∣rant, of any thing; they pierce into ment hearts, and wills; And being so, how comes it Madam, you demand of me, the cause that brought me hither? can it be possible, that you, who have read o're my heart, have not found there, your Picture drawn by Cupids hand. In truth, I thought whiles we aboad at Bisnagar, I had made that doubt clear enough, and fear'd, I had thereby transgressed. For though, from that time you had known the truth of my extraction, I ought not for all that, so much to hazard me, as to declare my love unto you, nor should have had a ground, to flatter me with any hope; I knew, it must be needs some God, that should enjoy you, and that never any, such as you re∣semble, subject themselves, except in antient stories, to the love of mortall men. Their complements had longer lasted if an ac∣cident had not prevented them; The King did use to visit his daughter the Princess, twice, or thrice a week, in her retirement, and sometimes used to walk with her in her little Garden: this
caused Saradin, whose care provided for all chances, after he had left our Lovers together, to play the sentinell, not fearing, after so strict charge was given, that any save the King would venture to come in; and when he saw, that his Majesty not finding Orazia in her cham∣ber, went towards the Garden, he ran before him, to give notice of it, to them; This newes, some∣what troubled the company, who after Orazia had commanded Ariomant, to be next evening with his deer Callistenus at the same place, were fain, for that time to divide themselves. This visit, though she loved her Father very well, was nothing acceptable: for she impati∣ently desired to know his name, and quallity, whom yet she knew, but by the name of Ario∣mant, although indeed she was not ignorant that he was born a Prince; besides, that Ariomant supposing she had know his whole extraction, was wonderfully doubtfull, who should have instructed her, not daring to imagine that Aron∣tus had in dying faild his promise; for he had ever promised him, and Callistenus too, that he would never make them known, save to his Si∣ster Orazia, till themselves were fit, and in con∣dition, to appear before the King of Narsingus as their qualities required; and death preven∣ting him, he thought, (as was most likely,) that he had committed that secret to the faithfull Saradin; doubtfull however, he retired as then, resolved to be next night, in due obedience to his Mistresses commands, where now they met, and very shortly after to embarque himself for
Cambaye, that with as much speed as may be, he might return with Callistenus, (who had like in∣terest to come back with him,) in a pompous train, and fashion, worthy of their royall great∣ness. Scarce had he set his foot within his lodg∣ing, but his dear Callistenus meeting him, knew by hit eyes, the pleasure that took up his heart, and presently he found himself engaged to tell him of his sweet adventure; which better to communicate, they lay that night together, which they spent in pleasing talk, till next day administred more ample cause of joy; for though this pleasure seemed to have respect alone to A∣riomant; Callistenus who so intirely loved him, participated also of it, and so much, as very neer to shew the same impatience, and desire. If now, Prince Ariomant for his part languisht in that amorous expectation, The fair Orazia lived in a sweet unquietness, on hers; little that night she rested, and the dry once come, she num∣bred every hour, and minute of the same; she thought a thousand times, the sun had slack'd his wonted course, and dream'd on nothing, but the silence of a night, more happy than the former, that with more conveniency she might again be∣hold him, whose gracefulness, and sweet behavi∣our, form'd themselves a thousand times that day to her imagination. Her wishes, when the Sun had set, were granted; for insteed thereof, she saw her deerest Ariomant appear, whose sight was more pleasing unto her eyes, and warmth more acceptable to her soul: he with his friend, thought first to have been at the place, but found
himself prevented by the Princess great impati∣ence, who had scarce given Lisimena time to end her Supper, for her hast to draw her to that plea∣sing and delightfull place. She was of brown but clear complexion, as all the beauties commonly of Asia, are; But in all Europe was not found a favour, more exact, nor delicate than hers, she had no part of all her face, which was not accompanied with speciall graces; and eyes, which for their sweetness might be feared, had yet more boldness to acquire mens hearts, than others. When she went to find the Princess Lisimena in her Chamber, she had cast carelesly about her, a kind of Indian garment, of black Sattin, with∣out any other Ornament, than a cutwork, very delicate, wherewith her smock was edged, and turn'd back upon her garment; about her neck she only wore a bobbin, her hair was black, and curl'd by nature into slaves, hung in some places on her neck, whose lustre was the more set off, and though it was in careless manner that it hung, yet seem'd it not without a kind of art. 'Tis true, her mourning did require more mode∣sty, than at that time her habit shew'd; and yet did Lisimena think her too severe; Sister (said she) so much mourning does not become you well, on this occasion, where nothing but con∣tent should be exprest, and therewithall, rather in jest, than earnest, she untied her string from her neck, and in its room, hung on, a string of costly Pearl, which lay upon her Table; next, under colour of the heat, which was not over,
she trust her foresleeves up unto her elbowes, and delivered her a rich Bracelet of Diamonds which she wore her self, pull'd off her Gloves, that her fair hands might shew themselves, and took away the Handkerchief, that hid her neck, and would not conceal from Ariomant a part of her perfecti∣ons; After this manner, Lisimena accompanied her deer Orazia, to her closet, wraped with leaves, without more company than little Aqui∣lant, whom they distrusted not, and bore his Mistress train, for that she had not time enough for haste to make her self unready. A very little time had they been there, when Ariomant, together with his faithfull friend Cal∣listenus, slid secretly into the door, which lay to∣wards the City, and whereof, he had the key de∣livered him. Many, and happy were the com∣plements that past on either side, But, though there be no excellency, wherewith they were not accompanyed, and all their words selected, such as love form'd in their mouths, delighting to propose, and answer for our Lovers, I forbear repeating of them, lest the Readers take offence, and because Ariomant perceiv'd by Orazia's dis∣course, that she yet knew not his extraction, and that she long'd to know it from his mouth, which, he would gladly have excused, if man∣ners would have let him; But seeing no way how he could refuse, at length, being all four sat, and that their silence witnessed their defires to hear; he thus began to say.
THE HISTORY OF ANAXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The second BOOK. MOst fair, and vertuous Princess, see∣ing you desire to know who I am, and from my own mouth to learn the History, of mine, and the companion of my misfor∣tunes, my deer Friend Calliste∣nus his Life; I am most willing to obey you; and although, our Crosses have been great, and peril∣lous, our voyage more than common, yet find I more contentment, than displeasure in reflecting on them, when I call to mind, how you are the
sole object of our hazards, and that for your love only we have undertaken them. But ere I ship me in that long discourse, 'tis fit I justifie the good opinion, you have of my birth, that if our merits be not equall, you may at least∣wise find our qualities, as like as our affections; and that you may be able to make good the ho∣nour you have done me, to accept my service, ere you very well had known me. It cannot be, but you have often heard of Al∣cidaris, who being descended from the great Tamberlin, and only remainder of his race, hath to the Empire of Cambaye, joyn'd the Kingdoms of Dulcinde, Candahar, and Mandao, and who at present, with your Father, shares the Soveraign∣ty of all the Indes. From him 'tis (Madame,) whence I derive my self, & who hath bred me, in the hope of all his Kingdomes, which surely I should scorn, but for the hope I have to reign in them, one day, with you. Hereat the Princess Orazia could not conceal her joy of heart, to be beloved by so great a Prince, but interrupting him, did say, that both the greatnesse, and de∣servings of Alcidaris, were as the Sun, so known unto her. But, reply'd Ariomant, because we are not so neer neighbours, but that many Hills, and Rivers separate us, and for it may be you have never heard of all the passages of my Fathers Life, which do concern my Story; I must briefly tell you, that this Prince at five and twenty yeares of age, was Heir unto the Kingdome of Guzarat, which you call otherwise, Cambaye; he married, (more for policy of state, than force of love,) the
Princess Berenica, who was only daughter, and heir, unto the King of Candahar, and of Mandao his neighbour, and his tributary (who shortly after died) and by that match enlarged his limits to the Northern parts, even to the Mountain of Nogrocot, which the Greeks call Paropamisse, from whence the famous River Indus springs, which, but for only watering our Lands, gives name to all the Indes. But this unhappy Queen, who did Idolatrise her Husbands vertues, liv'd but a short time with him, after her fathers death, but on whole year; wherein, she gave him all imaginable proofes of perfect love, and so far forth, as having in her self free power, she gave him, be it, whether the child wherewith she went did live, or otherwise, her two fair Crowns; and just as soon as she had brought that little Prince into the world, with pains incredible, she, choaked in her Convulsions; and the first hower of her childbed, gave the last unto her life. Now though Alcidaris were not ensirely so much tender of her, at she of him, nor had the just, same feelings, that she had, yet could not chuse but by that unexpected death, receive most strong impressions; great was the grief he shewed, and whatsoever pomp, the quality of so great, and vertuous a Princesse, as she was, requir'd, did wait upon his mourning, and her Funerals. But as there is no wound, however it may seem incurable, but time may heal, this which Alcidaris received, was not so great, as that there needed a whole age to comfort him; for after
one year ended, he became most passionably ena∣mored of the Queen Anaxareta, who, by the death of her brother Spimantus, newly being ar∣riv'd, was heir unto the Kingdom of Dulcinda, which, does on the one side border on the King my fathers Countries, and on Persia on the other. The reason why so passionately he pursu'd that Love, was, that besides his pleasure, there was profit in it; and thought, that by uniting Dul∣cinda to his other Kingdoms, he should be an equal powerful neighbour to the Persian. Perswaded by these reasons, but more by love, that forced him, he sent one named Pirobus, and of the ablest of his Kingdom, in Embassage to the Queen Anaxareta. He was receiv'd, as coming from so great a Prince, with much magnificence: but wondred greatly, that the answer he received was no more favorable: She only told him thus, that the King of Cambaye had done her a great deal of honour, but that the King her brother, being so lately dead, and having scarce wip'd off her tears, it could not be, she should so soon for∣get him, nor in such haste run from his Funerals, to her own espousals; and therefore pray'd the King his Master, not to hold it strange, that she desired more time to think thereof. This Embassador, who was a man of great dis∣cretion, and knew the extream passion of Alcida∣ris, resting but poorly satisfied with this answer, and knew his Master would be likewise so, be∣thought him, that of Force, some greater reason must restrain the Queen than of her brothers
death, who almost two years since had died, and should have caus'd her greater joy, than sorrow; for which cause, he makes adresses to the chiefest Statist there, and dives into him, to discover, if he could, his Mistriss meanings; he shews him, how the King of Cambaye, was her neer neigh∣bour, and one of the most powerful Monarchs of the Indies. That over and above, his greatness, and his wealth, he had all qualities which might commend a man to a fair Ladies acceptation; that in all Asia, his Mistresse could not finde a fitter match; that there needed no long time, to think upon a matter which depended only on her will; And, that he knew not what to infer by the coldness of her answer, save that she loved some other, since she neglected the desires of a Prince so mighty, and one, who could not be, but a great strength unto her. This States-man who desired to pay him with more solid reasons than the Queen had done, thought, twas no matter of importance if he told him, what he guest she thought, which was, that being of a mighty spirit, and knowing that Al∣cidaris had had a son by the Queen Berenica, who as himself, was call'd Alcadaris, and should when he were dead, possesse his Kingdoms, she could not abide, that those, that should proceed from her, should ever happen to be seconds, or in rank, or in affection; and being able to dispose of the Kingdom of Dulcinda, she thought she might do better, to chuse out a Gentleman, her Subject, who should be her creature, and by whom she might have children heirs to her pos∣sessions,
than to match a King, of whose inheri∣tance she could not see a hope for hers. And this said he, in my opinion is the cause, that backs the Queen: for she is not so ignorant, both of the qualities, and vertues of the King your Master, but that she holds him for the man of most ad∣vantage for her choice, save only that his heir is born already. Pirobus, more satisfi'd herewith, than by the reasons given him from the Queen, though very little notwithstanding, seeing how far from gi∣ving comfort to his Master, returns towards him, and from point to point gives him account of his Embassage. Alcidaris, as well as possible he could, dissembled the disquiet this il news procur'd him, and I know not if his love oblig'd him, or, that as yet, some little hope remained for him. But, as if heaven would favour his desires, about eight, or ten months end, report ran all about, that the young Prince Alcidaris was very sick, and that his tender age, not able to defend it self, against the strong assaults of a continued Feavor, death had delivered him. The sorrow which the King put on, was so great, that for the space of forty daies, he suffred not himself to be seen by any creatures, except Pirobus, his faithful Counsellour. The noise of his great losse immediately was spread throughout, and came to the Queen A∣naxaretas ears, who, seeing that great obstacle re∣mov'd, desir'd no greater thing in all the world than that alliance; and in a word to end, Pirobus being sent the second time had his desire, and some few daies after, did Alcidaris possesse both
Anaxaretas beauties, and her Kingdoms, peace∣fully. Now Madam, from that happy Marriage I am sprung, and named Anaxander from my Mothers name. Almost about the same time I was born, Ame∣tista, Queen of Citor, and only sister to the King my father, was delivered of Piroxenus, whom you see here under name of Callistenus; we were bred up and taught together; and besides our age, and blood, which knit us in a perfect friendship, na∣ture augmented it by so exact a correspondency of humours, as never was observed the least dis∣parity in our opinions; and truly since our friend∣ship hath foundation but on vertue only, tis not to be admired, that from a cause eternal, such effects of everlastingness are seen. The wise Evander, from my tendrest youth had me in government, and Alcidaris, who much desired to frame me after the example of that ho∣norable man, drew him from the Province of Carmanie, on very great expence: for he was Master of some nine or ten Languages, and igno∣rant of nothing, that another man did know. He had not only care of me, but likewise had an eye to Piroxenus, whom he found exceeding capable of his good doctrines; and we both so well pro∣fited by his instructions, as we soon learned all the secrets of the Persian and Arabique tongues, which travel mostly, throughout all the Indies this side Ganges. Besides the recreations of our minds, we exer∣cis'd our bodies likewise; and familiarly disgui∣sing our selves, on daies of ceremony, or delight,
we got the prizes with our Lances, and at Fen∣cing too; and such as had our names in question us'd to say, that if we were not above seventeen years of age, we might procure the envy of the most expert and accomplisht Knights of Gouza∣rat. I ask you humble pardon Madam, if in this, or any other part of my discourse, I chance to speak in commendation of my own exploits, since I have said already, that the gods dispos'd my humour like to Piroxenus, and therefore can∣not without prejudice to him, speak meanly of my self; and seeing we have both pursu'd the same adventures, there is no glory which I may have stollen, but he shareth with me in the theft. We were of eighteen years compleat, before we felt the smallest sense of Love; and did enjoy, all harmless pleasures, that our age aloud. If sometimes, wearied with our exercise, or tired with Hunting, we frequented Dancing Matches, and bestowed our time in visiting of Ladies, twas only for civility, or manners sake; or rather, through perswasions of Evander, who, finding us, to have obtain'd enough of what he shew'd us, said often to the King, we wanted nothing but a little Love, and that the least time we should take delight to spend with Ladies, would ac∣compish us, for people of breeding; because, said he, Love hath this proper to it self, to waken, and refine the mind, and raise it to high meditations, making it likewise able for most glorious under∣takings. With such discourses likewise did he often en∣tertain
us, wherein we much delighted; and sure, we were like those, who from a far, discover beauteous prospects, but know not what waies lead unto them; we every day saw store of beau∣ties within the City of Campanel, where com∣monly Alcidaris does hold his Court: but in their faces, found not the effects of good Evanders words. But on a day, being in the Queen A∣naxareta's Closet, where least of any thing I thought of Love, that god upon a suddain made me know his power, and let me see, that if till then he had omitted me, twas only, by a favour extraordinary, to reserve me, pure, and whole, to serve the most incomparable Orazia. Being I say, within the Queen my mothers Closet, where certain Merchants of Arabia which traded into China, were allowed to enter, and had about them, all the rarities of those parts they had past through; They unfolded, among others that they had, a Picture, which surpriz'd the eyes of all the Curt, and made them instantly confest, that if it were a piece drawn by the life, the Lady that it represented was the greatest beauty of the world; you are not much deceiv'd, said one of the Merchants, for tis an original, after the Princesse Orazia, drawn by a Chinois Painter, now abiding in the King∣dom of Narsingus, at a great allowance of the Kings, as being the renowned Painter of the In∣dies; And this fair Orazia, is sole daughter to that mighty King, worthy indeed, more for her rare perfections, to nommand all men, than for her great descent.
No sooner had I cast my eyes upon that beau∣teous Picture, but suddenly I found an alteration in my heart, and was a certain augure of my new Loves birth. Piroxonus, who could read my sc∣cret thoughts, know by my change of face, and my reiterated commendations of that piece, that it had touch'd me more than pictures use to do: The Queen on t' other side perceiv'd I had a liking to it, and though she had a purpose to have kept it for her Closet, she bestowed it on me, and as deer a present I esteem'd it, as the life she gave me. I therefore took it with me, and it soon became the most invaluable part of all my goods. I could not hide from my deer Piroxenus, the de∣light I took therein, he was the witness of my transports, and my exstacies, which often in his presence, with such meditations, I accompanied. O worthy inasterpiece of Art, as the great beauty you present, must be of Nature, can it be possible, that you should have at first, more power upon me, than so many living wonders, who so long, in vain, have sought to snare my liberty; and that your sweetness without motion, which but in shadows, and in lines, is repreented here, can kindle in my soul, so pure, and living flames? Indeed, I thought, that the divinity, of whom you a the image, did communicate its power, but unto Love alone, and that he only was allow'd, to take from her fair eyes, the fiery shafts, where with he burneth all the World; and yet I by this table see, a mortal hath by force of his imagination, shared reputation with a god, and burns me with the shafts, which he hath drawn, from the incom∣parable Orazias charms.
Piroxenus, seeing that in carnest I was taken, did what he could to please my passion, which, by so great a beauty, was so justly caused, and was the first, that to deliver me from my continuall thoughtfulness, advis'd that we might secretly make a journey to Narsinga; and that it was high time, to manifest our selves in some brave action; and that besides, an universal peace being throughout the Countries of Alcidaris, we should go some where else, to seek adventures, both of Love, and Armes. Judge you, fair Princess, if this were acceptable counsel, yea or no, and whether a greater testimony, of my deer Cozins friendship could be given me. I must confess if he prevented me, twas only by his speech: for all my purposes were that way bent, and if I had been so unhappy, as that he had been of other mind, I must confess before him here, I should have hazarded to leave him, and that a meer ne∣cessity would force my separation from him, to go joyn me to the fairest, and most excellent part of my soul. After that time, we often used to retire in pri∣vate, that more freely we might talk of my new passion, and to consider how to steal away un∣known; but we could not so conceal our enter∣tainments, but the wise Evander, who at all hours came into my Closet, did surprize us, and had learned something of my Love, but not of our design; for though in earnestness of talk we might sometimes be loud, yet held we, at the least noise made, for fear of being discovered. But one day, looking (I know not how before he entred)
through a crany of the door, and finding our talk some kinde of action, he had a mind to hear∣ken to us; but the thickness of the door, and length of the whole room betwixt us, took away the sound, except of some few words, and he could collect no more, but that we spake of Love, and of a Picture, and of Orazia. How ever, he was very glad, to see we did be∣gin to rouze our selves a little, and to finde by our discourse, our stony hearts began to mollifie. But coming suddainly upon us, and at an instant husht, he could not chuse but make a little war upon us, and especially on me. Indeed said he Anaxander, having but two daies been in love, you are a good practitioner, that can reserve your self, and keep so strict a silence before ose, from whom you have not kept your most concealed thoughts: But if my ears have not deceiv'd me, you should be rather glad than sorry, that have your Love in your possession, & are sure, that dain∣ty Picture, will refuse, not one of your embraces. Verily, Madam, I was never so surpriz'd in all my life, by any accident, as at his words, and twas great hap, but in the exigent I was, I had from point to point discovered all our purposes, and conjur'd him to assist us; but when I saw he conti∣nued on his jesting, & spake not of our voyage, I guest he had discover'd nothing; so as we were content to keep on sporting with him, without so much as striving to deny the love whereof he had accused us. However, since that time, we more reserv'd our selves: and that at length, we might be free from those disturbances, our fears, and
our continual jealousies had kept us in, we took a firm, and valiant resolution, to go on with our design, which we conceal'd from all the world, except two Gentlemen, that had from youths been bred with us, and whose entire affections, and fidelity to do us service, we had known: He whom I took, and who is with me still, is cal∣led Almerin, and he alone wen tout of Campa∣nel with us, because we thought it sit to leave Neander, (for so was piroxenus Squire called) as a spie, some daies at Court, to learn, what would be said of our departure, and gave him Pala, for a randezvous, which is some either, or nine daies journy off, from Campanel; and for that Town is in the desert, and neer joyning to the oun∣tains of Gate, a little from the apssage to Narsin∣ga, which we went, we thought that few would have imagined we had gone a way so steep and difficult. We were a thousand times, about to ship our selves at the Port of Cambaye, but thought the voyage would be over-long by sea, and hap∣pily the King your fathers Court might be an Bisnagar, which would much shorten our jour∣ney, and save us labour to crosse over the high Mountains of Gate, which as we understand, do separate your two Kingdoms; and have such pro∣perty, as to divide the Winter, and the Summer so betwixt them, as when tis could at Bisnagar, tis warm at Narsinga. We were the more invited to go by land, for the defire we had, to passe through the Kingdom of Decan, which lay in our way; whereof we had heard great praises, and that among all the
Royal Courts of Asia, there was not any which exceeded that, whereof the gallantry was a the highest degree that could be wisht, and Ladies courteous as in any part of the World, we there∣fore resolv'd to go that way, in some sort to re∣fresh our selves, as to observe, whether it were a truth was said of it, that of all parts of India, men were best on horsoback there, and where all the Rules of fencing (which my Couzin and my self knew very well) were best observed. We therefore, Piroxenus and my self, when as the Moon was one night very favourable to our flight, stole out of Campanel, without more com∣pany then Almerin, for we had left Meander in the City; and when we had advanc'd some ten Leagues forward, I found my Cousin had had more foresight than I; for doubting that we might be followed when 'twas day, being found wanting; he had commanded a servant of his call'd Madaron, whose honesty he long time knew, to go two dayes before, with a couple of excellent horses, upon one of which, himself was mounted, and led the other in his hand, and gave him charge to stay for us, at a little Town call'd Oby, which is some twenty Leagus from Campa∣nell, upon the road of Pala, and was Neanders Rendezvous. After the whole nights travell, and that day began to break, Piroxenus seeing me troubled, for the fear I had left they might send through all parts after us, he told me of his pro∣vidence, and taking provender out of a Sck, which Almerin carryed for our horses, gave them an hours space to breath; and id as fast
as we could possible, till we had teached Oby, and commanded Almerin to come but slowly af∣ter us, & a far off, as well because we had no fresh horse for him, as that, if we were follow'd on that way, where neer he had a house, he might diver their course; and when he should be come where Madaron was at Oby, they should find us in the City Bialis, which is from thence two little jour∣neys, where we would expect them, and with earnestnesse injoyn'd them, from thence forward, to forget our names, of Anaxander, and Pi∣roxenus, and to call us Taxilus, and Cleantus. Some two houres after the sun was up, we ariv'd at Oby, where we left our horses with Madaron, who had sufficient time, to walk, and refresh them, before Almerin could come; and after we had eaten somewhat, making great hast, & three or four times resting our horses, and our selves, and feeding them with what we had, we got to Bialis, withall the speed we could. Next day, our people, without any accident came to us, and we altogether, undiscover'd, took our way to Pala. We had not long been there, before Neander came unto us, from whom we learnt, in how great trouble, all the court was, at our absence; and that indeed, the first two or three dayes, they were not so much troubled, be∣cause they thought we had been gone about some secret wantonnesse: but when the King per∣ceiv'd, no newes was to be had of us, his anger mastred him, and if the Queen had not restrain∣ed him, he would have gone beyond the bounds of Fatherly affection; These are said she, but
tricks of youth, which are to be excus'd; and me thinks no strange matter that young Princes, li∣ving in continual restraint, run out a little, and a while seek the freedom which our Court af∣fords them not. 'Tis altogether contrary, said the King, for Princes ought not to commit such follies; Their Governours, and good instructi∣ons given them, together with their births, should make them old before their time, and being en∣lightned as they are from every where, their meanest actions should be squared so, as to be good examples for the world; and me thinks they that cannot rule their passions, are unwor∣thy to have power of men. But neither King, nor Queens displeasure, might compare with sage Evanders discontent. That Grave old man, who loved us only, and who a∣mongst his other excellent Sciences, had also cunning in the art of divination, which among the Persians is a common thing, had found a∣mong his other Speculations, that Piroxenus and my self, should at two severall times, run hazard of an extraordinary, and a violent death; and fearing lest effects might follow his predictions, remembring us so often to retire in private, and to have heard us speak of Orazia's Picture, he suspected, we might secretly have undertaken a voyage to Narsinga, and more, he was confirm'd in his belief, and apprehension, when he under∣stood, that, that same night, wherein we had departed, a Ship having the wind at large, had from the Port of Cambaye, hoysed Sail towards the Isle of Zeilan; Where the War was hot a∣gainst
the King of Maldives; that either for re∣nown, we would go serve under one of those two Kings, or else, land i some one of the King of Narsingas havens, whose neighbour, and all, and friend the King of Zeiland is. Having a good while thought thereon, he went and told the King of his opinions, who presently believ'd we had indeed that way escaped, and protested, that the Captaines life should answer, as he thought, for carrying us away without his leaves Wherefore a Post was preently dispatch'd from Campanel to Cambaye, with directions that hee should set forth with speed, a light Vessell, to seek afer that, which three or four dayes past had put to Sea, and for more surety, he di∣spach'd another Messenger by Land to Bazaim, to send out another Vessell, to surprize that, which he thought had wafted us; and that if happily the first might not light on him, the o∣ther should not chuse but meet him: however, they were charg'd to go as farre as zeilan in their chace, and that before he could have doubled the Cape of Commorin they should have some newes of him. Here, Madam, you may see, what news Nean∣der brought us from the Court, for which cause having call'd a Councill among us, we resolv'd to put off our journey to Narsinga for a while, and spend delightfully some time in the King of Decans Court, which sometimes is at the City of Bider, and otherwhiles in the great City of Vi∣saporus; and because those goodly cities, are far in the Countrey, we conceiv'd, they would
not come, and seek us there, and that after the time were past, wherein those that were gone in quest of us, had in vain enquired in Narsinga; we would freely go on our jouruey, under the names which we had newly taken, of Taxilus, and Cle∣ontus. Wherefore we departed from Pala, and us'd such industry, as we arived at Bider, where we thought to find the King of Decan, as being the chiefest City of his Kingdom: But we understood, that he was but a little while before, retir'd to Visaporus, which, over and above, that it is bet∣ter fortified with men, and walls, is likewise sea∣red in an air, more temperate, and pleasing; And here, Madam, it is fit I tell you something of this poor Prince, who not long ago was Master of so many Countreyes, and such mighty wealth, and through his own default, hath caused the ruine of himself, and them. I doubt not but you know the whole story of his life, and therefore will I say no more of his behaviours, nor his do∣ings, than to the purpose of my History. This miserable King, who car'd for nothing more, than how in ease, and quietnesse to spend his time, and buried in voluptuousnese, being, both lasie in his nature, and distrustfull, even to fear his own Children, whose, names were, De∣monax the one, as he himself was called, and A∣raxus the other; that at greater case, hee might enjoy his soft contentments, cast the burden of his State from off himself, and gave the charge of his twelve great Provinces, to twelve of his free'd slaves, upon condition, that each of them
should send his Eldest Son into the City of Visa∣porus, there to remain as pledges to him, where, for greater safety, he retir'd. He had besides those Sons, a Daughter of ex∣ceeding beauty, who, as the Kingdom, and the City she was born in was call'd Orixa, for in former time, King Demonax his father and the Queen his wife went thither great with child, as then she was, to wash her in the River Ganges, which passeth through the Kingdom of Orixa, and hath this secret vertue, that it clenseth from all sorts of sins; and I have understood, the King your father, whose it is, draws a large tribute from it; for the Pilgrimage is famous through the Indes. But, for it does not appertain to my discourse, I say no more thereof, to tell you only in the pur∣sute of my History, that we went from Bider unto Visaporus, where we were sure to finde the King of Decans Court; and just as we arrived at the great City, we heard many Trumpets, sounding flourishes, with distinct pauses betwixt each flou∣rish, and three times renew'd, and this within the great place, where stands the Royal Palace, and after, saw a great man clad in a rich Coat of Arms, accompanied by four Heralds; and be∣cause, after having gone three or sour times a∣bout, at the sound of those Trumpets, and bra∣zen Drums, they at length stayed about the mid∣dle of that place, we drew us neer, to understand what they would say, and heard, that one of them, with louder, and resounding voice than the rest, uttered these following words.
Be it known unto all Princes, Lords, Knights, Are amōg the Indians as the Jani∣zaries a∣mong the Turks. Naires, & their Chiefs, throughout the whole Kingdom of Decan, and Malabares adjoyning, and of whate∣ver Kingdom, or Country else, ex∣cepting such as have been banished, or are enemies unto our Sovereign Lord King Demonax, that the eighth day from this, being he twentieth of the Moon, in this same place, shall be a great defiance at arms, amost noble, and magnificent Combate sought with Darts, and Lances, in their fit caparisons, with Crests, Coats of Arms, Foot-cloaths, and Targets garnished with sine devices, as bra Combatants, according to the antient customs of this Kingdom; and as Chiefs; Prince Demonax defendant on the one side, and Araxus as assi∣lant on the other, all for the glory of the King, and celebration of the happy day of his nativity, which falls to be the twentieth of this Moon; And for those causes, know ye moreover, Princes, Lords, and Knights, and Capains of Naires, as well of this Kingdom, as whatever Country else, who for the love of honor, shall desire to excrcise themselves, and for the pleasure of the Ladies; that they must think thereon, and chuse them God-fathers, that their names may be written down before the Judges of the Combate; of whom they must be taught the rules, and that they will be more encouraged to glory, when they knew, the Ladies purpose to bestow, most fair and costly prizes, as well upon the Darts, and Persian Lances, as the Fencing after the cu∣stom
of Molabar, which will be exercis'd the following daies. As soon as this Proclamation by the Herald was concluded, we withdew our selves out of the throng that compassed him, extreamly pleas'd, that an occasion should so soon be offered after our arrivall wherein our skill might be commen∣ded; and knowing very well the Language, for the great conformity it hath with ours, having enquired of the first we met, where we ruight be conveniently lodged, we were conducted by one of them unto a house of his, which was both great and spacious, where certain other strangers were already entertain'd, which flockt from at all parts there, against the great solemnity. During the time which we were there, before the Combate; because the Herald in the en dof his Proclamation, had prescrib'd the manner of the furnitures, and Crests, Coatarmours. Sad∣dles, Frontstalls, Foot-cloaths, Targets, Darts, and Spears, we fitted all, and went, and rank'd our selves under the Prince Araxus Standard, who was Chief of the adventurers, and having a good liking to us, although he took us but for Persian Knights, assign'd us God-fathers, and en∣tertain'd us with all manner of civility; and because he would not discontent a great many Lords of note, who had as well as we, disposed themselves under his colours, he privately passed a most obliging complement unto us, endeavour∣ing to make us think he held his party much in∣forced by our helps. But as you shall perceive, that argument of his friendship, cost us very dear,
for from that time his Brother Demonax grew very jealous of us, and delighted ever since, to shew us publique scornes, and sought by all occa∣sion how to hurt us: But we were comforted, to see, how even to his own Sister Orixa he shew'd a very ill affection; because she could never en∣dure his Couzin the Prince Palandurus love, whom Demonax esteem'd, and favour'd all he could: and this withdrew him from his Sisters friendship wholly, with a protestation, that at length she should repent the scorn she had of his dear friend. To come again to my discourse, after, accor∣ding to the order, and the ancient custom of De∣can, the defendant, and assaylant, the Judges, and the Heralds, had made a pompous entrance into the City together, with the Knights, who had dispos'd themselves, to eithers Standard, the night before the Eve unto the Sports, and Combates, the Ladies, by the Queens commands, assembled in the Palace hall to Dance, of whose pomp, it may be, Madam, if I speak a word, or two, it may not be unpleasing. At one end of the room, there was a Theater erected, where the Queens State was placed; and over it, did sparkle, twelve Candlesticks of Rnbies, and of Saphirs, mixt together, fill'd with an infinite number of Waxlights; about it were three degrees of seats, above each other, where the Princesses, the Ladies of honor, and the Queens Maids were set; and above all, the Queen her self, upon a Chaire of black Velvet embroydered with Pearl, was rais'd about the
middle of the most eminent degree, and on her right hand, sat the Princesse Orixa. All the Ladies that should dance, were clad in a clean other habit, than their custom, and which they never used, but on such daies of ceremony, or of publique feasts. First, they were dressed in their hair, with a number of little flowers, and great sprigs of Sil∣ver, came out at the middle of their Garlands, made of Pearl, and Diamonds; their veils were made of cloth of Silver, strewed with little Pearl, and edged round with great; their Gowns of white Sattin, embrodered with Gold, and Silver, and throughout in works of greater Pearl, whose hanging sleevers were likewise covered, and their coats about below; the edges were in scollops, and hem'd about with Pearl, and above all the dressing, the Gold and Silver embrodery, was so raised, as it seem'd to be of Gold-smiths work. They had all of them a kinde of great band, after the Persian manner, with peakes and big Pearl hanging at them; The shining of the precious stones which were in their chains, joyning with the gliftring of Gold about their cloaths, did di∣versly multiply the reflections of the light which came from the twelve Rubie, and Saphir Can∣delsticks, and of thirty more of Christal ena milled with divers colours, which gave light to all the rest of the Hall, where, both the Court, and City-Ladies had their places. Right opposite unto the Queens, was likewise rais'd a Theater for the King, who had on either hand, the two Princes, Demonaz, and Araxus;
and at their feet, were all the Knights of note, al∣most in the same order, that the Ladies were dis∣pos'd, as well the Subjects of that Kingdom, as the Strangers, who were come to honor that feast, all of them richly clad, and glistring, with the luster of their Pearl, and Diamonds, and Rubies, which they wore in skarffs. The Master of the ceremonies, by Araxus commands, gave us our places; and though our habit was not so costly as the rest, because we had not time to invent them richer, or more brave; for Piroxenus and my self had spent our time in practising the Per∣sian manner of dancing; as soon as we began to move they all rose up to note our action, which was accompanied with a particular good grace: and the Princesse Orixa, after the Country custom comming to take me, and commanding me to lead her a Dance, I so far pleas'd her with my fashion, and my Complements, that from that time, she shew'd me more of her good will, than I desir'd she should; and truly I may say, that fa∣tal enterview, was the original of hers, and my misfortune. I will not busie my self, Madam, to describe unto you here, all the figures of the Combate at that feast, and publique joy, although their man∣ner were the finest of the world, their entries state∣ly, and the form of their field, the most glorious that I ever saw; becomming such as often exer∣cise such gallantries, and who were held the most expert of all Asia, and happily of all the world, as well in horsemanship, as all brave exercises us'd on foot, to give delight and recreation unto Ladies.
It sufficeth me to tell you, that after Piroxenus, and I, had in the combate of Spears, well ac∣quitted our selves, under araxus Sandard, which Combate was perform'd after the Moorish fashi∣on, and the Persian, and wherein I was in my fa∣thers Court well exercis'd, I was amazed, when the Dancing began, as on the former night, the Princesse Orixa waied on, by six fair Ladies, and accompanied by the Judges, and the Heralds, came, and staid her, just before that place of the Scaffold, where I was, and the King of Arms who went before her breaking the silence, made me this complement aloud, before them all. Taxilus, observe thy worth, and glorifie thy self before this famous assembly, seeing a stranger, and unknown among us, as thou art, thou hast been judged worthy of the prize, disputed by the Combate of Spears, which here the beauteous Princesse Orixa, daughter to our great King De∣monax comes to preent thee, waited on, by the impartial'st judges of the World, which show, that favour is not used in this Country, and that the vertue, rather than the greatness of the Com∣batants, all whom thou hast exceeded by thy skill, is here preferred; wherefore receive this prize which our Princesse prays thee to accept, and de∣scend from thence, that as the ancient custom of this Kingdom is, thou mayst by her be honored. I then in haste came down, and the Princesse op∣ned the prize, which was a big Ruby of great va∣lue; I bowed my self very low to thank her for the honour which she did me, and to kisse her hand; but in such ceremony she used to kisse the
conquerours face. In truth I was much taken with the favour, and yet more, when afterward my name was with a common, and loud voice borrowed from one to another through the Hall. Then preently the Trumpets sounded (which were Gold,) to cause the noise to cease, and the Princesse commanded me to lead her a Dance, where she appear'd so beautiful, and sweetly gra∣ced, as that Piroxenus most unhappily inclin'd to wish her well, as she did me; for though indeed his parts were greater, and more worthy fo her love, than mine, yet being prevented by a former passion, having seen me first, she was not able to turn her heart, or thoughts, upon another; and I, who had your living image printed in my heart, and taken up with a preoccupated will to give my self to you, I could not fall in admira∣tion of that unhappy Princess: charmes; who without lying might have ravisht any save my self. Next day, with just the like order, as the for∣mer, was the Combate perform'd with Darts, where, whether I may say my god, or evill for∣tune would, I know not, I won again the prize: for being again presented by that fair Princess: hand; enjoy, said she softly, in kissing it, courage Cavallier, there are other manner of prizes fitted for you. Truly Madam, I was at these words extreamly strucken; for though I knew, there were other prizes to be play'd the daies following, and that, it may be, she might have meaned them, which for my skill I might promise my self; yet that so
great a Princesse, shou'd whisper me in my car, as it were, a thing which a meer effect of Cour∣tesie, might suffer her to speak aloud, I could no chuse but take it for an extraordinary testimony of good will, which since, she hath sufficiently declar'd. Piroxenus who had still eyes upon her, as the first and only object of his passion, saw well e∣nough that twas on me, she cast her wisher, and her in my ear, (for I never concealed any thing from him) then was he troubled to the purpose, and cry'd out upon his evill fortune: dear Axan∣der, said he to me, the gods bear record, that thy interests have alwais been more dear to me, than my own; and that if thou hadst the least preten∣sion of the world to the most fair Oixa, though my love be violent towards her, yet should it give place to my friendship: but since thou think'st not on her, and that thy heart burns of another flame, why have not I the fortune, which thou scornest? and how extravagant is that Gods hu∣mour, who delights to trouble us all three, by causing in our hearts, affections so unequal? Now, loving him (fair Princesse) as I did, and guessing at his passion by my own, I swear I suffred more than half his torment; and that in some sort, I might swage his grief, I promis'd from that time, to do him all the faithful service that I could. But it fell out, that in those three daies follow∣ing which were ordain'd for Fencing, all the ad∣vantage, fell on us: for there being three prizes alotted for that exercise, which is most frequent
among the Indians, sometimes performed pill∣mell, sometimes as Duel, one rival against ano∣ther, by permission of the Ladies lov'd. Fortune would have it, that Araxus, Piroxenus and my self, obtain'd them all, which much encreased De∣monax his jealousie, and bettred much the love, his brother bare to us. When the Princesse pre∣sented me the priz: which was again adjudged me, she gave me yet more favour in her looks, than formerly; but then her eyes eprform'd the office of her heart, and tongue, and by a sweetly mixed smile, of love and joy, did more than ever make me invitation to her love. She wondered great∣ly, that among her many demonstrations of good will, she could perceive no alteration in my eyes, and that I still contain'd my self, and passed not the bounds of common complements: but as she flattred her self in her passion, she did with case perswade her self, that it was only fear that made me silent, and imputed all my back warkness, to the respect I ought her quality. Thus by her foolish thoughts deceiv'd, she let her motions sway her wholly, and without dread of that se∣vere, and rigorous Law, which did unpardona∣bly condemn to death, that daughter of the Roy∣al blood, who should admit the love of any pri∣vate man; the violence of her passion, making her more bold, than either her age, or sex, or her condition did allow of; she resolv'd what ever hapned, to discover to me by letter, what she thought, she had not, by her eyes, her actions, and her words, enough declar'd, and willing to ob∣lige her Nurse (whose help she needed) unto a
secrecy of so great waight, and dangerous impor∣tance: when she perceiv'd, how by her good, and solid reasons she resisted her; No, no, said she to her, my Nurse, the resolution is already taken, and in this matter, where alone the preer∣vation of my life depends, I rather crave your help, than aske your counsel; thou art the crea∣ture only, whose assistance, I can dare to ask, be∣cause thy faith, and thy affection are so known unto me; if thou fail'st me at this need, said she, in tears, some sword, or poyson shall not. These very words, she since told Piroxenus of, who ne∣ver concealed any thing from me, from whom I learnt besides, that thus her Nurse did answer her. Will you then Madam (said she) love a man un∣known, against your Country Laws; and more, against the Laws of honor and civility? having been still, till now, a great example of vertue a∣mong us, will you disgrace your good deeds, by your hasty taking of a husband, whom you must follow, through strange Countries, without rest, or honor, and it may be without maintenance? what so disordred appetite, perswades you to imprint this blot upon your royal house, and ever after to dishonor it? neither is that the least that may befall you; for if it should be known, you cannot shun a shameful death; but that the King your father, and the Princes your brothers, grown your enemies, will cause you to be burnt alive, a punishment inevitable to those Princesses who from their blood, do derogate by an unequal choice. How mother, reply'd the Princesse, thinkst
thou, that I, in Taxilus, have chose a common man, what though with us he be unknown, his words and actions shew he is of royal birth, and though I had no other witness of his blood, than my own courage, assure thy self, it is too great, to be subjected to a private mans affection; and that, that heart, whose vertue thou hast so ad∣mir'd, did never give so great a testimony, as when first it burned in so true a love, and sigh'd for Taxilus. Help me I pray thee therefore, for whether, after I have in thy presence, promised to Marry him, it be most fit to keep our passions secret, or else to follow him through deserts, to avoid the King my fathers fury, but especially my eldest brothers, who does hate me mortally; I never will forsake his company, nor reply thou more hereto, except thou wish me dead. The poor woman knew it would be labour lost to make her more remonstrances; and see∣ing, to how dangerous extremity, she was re∣duc'd, finding her self distracted by so severall apprehensions; her dear affection to her, and the pitty of her tears, prevail'd, at length, more with her, than the fear of her destruction, and the ruin of her honor; and for that cause furthered her desires in all she could, and so far forth, as to make choice of Callias, her own son, to serve, in that so dangerous a secret, which but to me alone, she would be glad to have communicated, had the modesty of sex, and eminency of her con∣dition suffred her, to call me to the consumma∣tion of our Wedding by her personal demands, to which how ever she ordain'd her self, then
presently, and boldly, sent me Callias with a letter to this purpose, with command to bring her back, my answer. Orixas letter to Taxilus. SInce in Loves enterprizes, thou art lesse couragious, than at Armes, and the respect thou seem'st to bear my quality, compels me to prevent thee, know, that I love thee Tax∣ilus; and that however, thou among us, art a stranger, and unknown; thy noble actions have enough declar'd thee, to oblige her, who hath scorn'd so many Princes Loves, Orixa, to chuse thee, notwithstanding all the King∣doms Laws, and good behaviour, for her hus∣band. If thou dost only worth my sex, no doubt but my proceeding will  too bolds, but in reflecting on thy own , and parts ac∣complished. I know, th  allow my choice, and like the freedom  thee with, to come this night, where Callins, my Nurses son, will, with all saith, will secrecie conduct thee, by the favour of obserity; and when in presence of my saithfull Nurse, (who shall be with me, only to receive thy oath) thou shalt have sworn thy self my lawfull hus∣band, thou shall finde me in my bed, without
more company, than thy belov'd Idea, and without other light than Cupids Torch, whom I already have conjur'd to rule in chief our Weddings, which with small ceremony, but great affection I accommodate. Callias, who was of the Princesses houshold, and had a mind to quit himself with reputation of the charge was given him, cunning, and wary as he was, comes in the morning to my lodging, and having asked to speak with me, from the Prince Araxus, says thus, softly in my ear, while Piroxenus, and our people were in presence, I present you, (Sir) with this letter in private, be∣cause I know you cannot read it without some expressions: it contains a secret of importance, which does promise better fortune than you look for; but, ere you do receive it, I am charg'd to crave your answer, which I will come to fetch within this hour: because, I know, the secret joy it brings you, will require some time to meditate thereon. After this complement delivered me, which yet, I could not comprehend, he went forth of my chamber, and I, retir'd into my Closet, where calling Piroxenus, I in his presence opened the Princesse letter, which put us both into astonish∣ment; and truly Madam, Callias was very right, when he told me, I should not read it without some disorder in my self: for how could I but be troubled, to perceive, that so great, and vertuous a Princesse, so much honored me in vain, by an
election of such grace and favour, and did lose her time, seeking that heart, which was already none of mine. As for Piroxenus, where the decla∣ration, which the Princess made me of her passion, should in likelihood have cooled his, and made it lesse, it in such sort increased it, and the incre∣dible sense he had thereof, wrung from him such complaints, and lamentations, as my heart was touched for him, and I could not chuse, but that my tears would shew it: but when I saw, his grief had choak'd his speech, and that with dy∣ing eyes which seem'd to crave my help, he turn'd towards me, I confesse that tenderness did blind me, Madam, and drew guilt upon me of a crime, which in your presence I accuse me of; pro∣vided it be sin, to knit two souls by an extraor∣dinary means, which by Loves tyranny were set asunder. Do not torment thy self, dear Piroxenus, (said I to him,) nor by thy woes, which slay me, cast us headlong into one destruction, much had I rather, since thy remedy is in my power, than that thou shouldst be more afflicted, hazard my honor for thy wellfare, which than life, has ever been to me more dear. Seeing thou canst not then command thy passion, nor my self obey that which the Princesse shews, I will chuse rather to be false to her, than fail in duties of that friend∣ship which I vowed thee from my infancy; but wherefore false, for sure, I think I shall oblige her, if I send thee, to supply my room, and that she cannot take offence: thou art, as I am, born a Prince, thy qualities exceed, and, where in me, she thought to have made choice but of a Knight,
thou wilt hereafter make her know, by telling what thou art, that by the gods allowance, and beyond her thoughts, she shall have met her equal. Courage than Piroxenus, nothing is to be feared, in thy enterprize, save the beginning; and since she lets me know, that Callias by the favour of the night must guide me, and that there shall no other torch enlight her chamber but what Love pro∣vides, thou mayst without discovery passe in my room, and steal thee our again, before the day reveal thee. If in this counsel, I offend the gods, I hope they will forgive me, when they call to thought, that for thy safety and the Princesse life I have contriv'd it. Ah my dear Anaxander answered he, half wakened from his swounding, by my words, how is thy friendship helpfull? and the comfort thou administrest, a dear and real proof, of per∣fect love: but do not think thy honor is ingaged by the counsel thou dost give me, nor that the fair Orixa, taking me for thee, can be abused, since I am certainly, thy other self; and for like reason, do not think the fruits which I shall reap under thy name from her embraces, will be lesse sweet, or acceptable, than if I were received to her bed, as Piroxenus, or Cleontus. But, that in every thing, she may not be deceiv'd, since Calli∣as is to fetch an answer to her letter, let me have leave, to write it for thee, and that promising to come unto her, I may make it good. Madam, I granted his desire, and let him write his letter in my Closet, which he had newly en∣ded, when as Callias came to take it from me, I
told him, that he should not fail to come to me at midnight, and that I would expect him in the door of my lodging, to be guided by him, where the Princesse had appointed, which secretly he promis'd me to do. But tis impossible to tell you her excesse of joy, when with a smiling counte∣nance, at his return he yielded her account of his so fortunate negotiation, but chiesly, when he gave her this deceitful testimony of my love, which thus was written. Cleontus letter to the Princesse Orixa. IF I have any cause to wonder at the honour you were pleas'd to do me, by the favour of your letter, tis rather through the meanness of my own deserts, than any way the free∣dom of your words. But since without accu∣sing your choice, I cannot condemn the mean∣ness of my merit, I must think, (or else ac∣cuse of errour, your opinion of me,) that I am worthier than others are, and that the favour I receiv'd, is not a dream, or an illusion, since I keep its markes. I will reserve the full ex∣pressions of the honour you have done me, un∣till we meet, if heaven do so much favour me, as that for excess of joy I die not by your
side, and send you these, but to advertise you, I look for Callias with impatience, and that your faithfull Taxilus, with closed eyes, is ready to obey you. Thus Piroxenus, and the Princess, passed the rest of that day in sweet disquiets for their amo∣rous expectation, and when the night was come, Callias, whom I had promised to finde me in my door, and by a certain sign exchanged by us, took Piroxenus in my stead; who only in his nightgown, followed his faithfull guide untill they came unto the foot of a Ladder made of Cords, and fastned at Orixas Chamber window; and after notice taken by him of the places he had passed, that he might not, in returning, misse his way, Callias delivered him the key of the lit∣tle Garden, and so softly took his leave of him. This happy Lover, who as yet proceeded in some trouble, for the fear he had of being known, was more than ever bold, when he perceiv'd the room was without light, and that he saw a hand out of the window making sign to him to hasten up; which with incredible diligence he did, and found the Nurse, who did receive him, in whose presence, he cast himself upon his knees before the Princesse bed; and after having kist her hand, and thankt her for the extream honour she had done him, to elect him for her husband, he protested to her all the faith and perfect love, that could be thought on, and did tell her, that it may be she would lesse repent her, of her
choice, when she should know his birth. Here Madam you will pardon me if I omit to tell you, of the transports, and the sweets of their embraces: for besides, that manners may forbid me, how should I well enough discribe a plea∣sure, which even he who tasted it, confest, he could not worthily enough expresse. I only think it fit to tell you, how that Love to be re∣veng'd upon them, for the sweet deceipt they us'd towards him, was often on the point to kill them both with joy. They spent five or six nights in such content∣ments, whiles Piroxenus, fearing to convert Orix∣a's love (which taking him for me she witness'd to him,) into hatred, dar'd not tell her who he was. Mean time, my heart, which did aspire but to your love, liv'd in continuall pain, and daily must my eyes belie it, and by stoln embraces, make the Princesse think, 'twas really my self, that did enjoy her as her husband; I never for complacency, us'd so great art, and though I should a thousand times expose my life for Pirox∣enus, he could not ow me more, than for the part I play'd in Visaporus, to advance his love, whiles my soul languisht after you, and with impatience burnt to go my voyage to Narsingus. But as impossible it is, that mans prosperity, and pleasures, can last in one condition long, without disturbances of fortune: it hapned, at the end of ten or twelve daies, that our poor Lovers were discover'd by a treason very strange. Callias had used, since this secret imployment, often to fre∣quent our house; he play'd for much, and was
a man of wit enough, but of small judgment, and lesse courage. Now it fell out, that being on a time, at dice with Almerin, and Neander, who are those two Gentlemen that went the voy∣age with us, they dissred on a cast, Callias and Al∣merin, which, as all truth of reason was, Neander (being third,) judg'd on his fellows side, at which, Callias who was arrogant, and of a naugh∣ty humor at play, was moved in such sort, as he fell into insolent, and injurious terms, and though ignoble, and of low descent he was, he fell into comparisons; Thou poor fellow, said Almerin to him, if thou were out of my Masters Lodgings, whom I honor, I would both kick thee, and pull out thy Tongue. My gallant see∣ing himself so ill handled, went away in great rage, and made complaint to a certain camrade of his, who was indeed a man of valour, that such an affront was offred him, and pray'd his help to take revenge by killing his enemy. That young man, who would for nothing of the world have committed such a baseness, advis'd him to revenge himself in way of honor, and of∣fred, that he would call Almerin to meet him with his sword: which he was fain to accept, but notwithstanding all the power he used on his cowardly disposition, he never had the heart to meet him at the place appointed, for which his camrade, who had challeng'd Almerin, excus'd himself extreamly to him, and Neander also, who had serv'd as second, protesting whiles he liv'd, to have no more to do with such companions. But Callias, who was stuck; as well the man
may be, that loses honor, and good name, con∣triving deadly vengance in his thoughts, but wan∣ting boldness to perform it, thought at last, to use the power, he believ'd he had with me by reason of his trust, and that undoubtedly he had my life & honor in his hands, to make me put off Almerin; for this cause he came to me, and con∣cealing his quarrel, made me a long discourse, which for troubling you I will not repeat, but issued from a great and notable subtility of wit, to make me understand that Almerin betrayed me; that he had discovered my Loves, and that it was expedient without more inquiry, to put him out or doors; I promis'd him to do it, but having learnt the passages betwixt them, I was far from giving Callias his desire, and was a∣mazed at his baseness. I told not Piroxenus of it, for the fear I had of angring him, and I con∣fess my folly, not foreseeing what misfortune might arise. This wicked man, seeing that not∣withstanding my promise to him, I had yet kept Almerin by me, enrag'd, to see himself disho∣nored be those, whose fortune, and whose credit he esteem'd himself the author of, was so much troubled, and his anger so prevailed over him, as he went to Prince Demonax, whom he knew lov'd me not very well, and told him he was bound to reveal a secret to him, which concern'd the Crown: In a word, he told him, that almost every night, I lay as husband, by the Princesse O∣rixa; and that after the matter was concluded between us, she had made choice of him, for hee friend to relie on, how that he had seemed very
willing; but that he could not chuse, but pre∣sently come and give him notice of it; that it was very easie to surprize us in bed together, where he assured him, I came three, or four times a week, by a Ladder of ropes, fastned at her Cham∣ber window; He moreover, for securing his mo∣thers life, protested, that she was no way accessary to that shameful act; He likewise did all he could, to palliate the Princess crime, and swore most horribly, to make the Prince believe I had subor∣ned her: but could not for all that, divert the tempest, which that night fell on her. For De∣mouax, who, though at the dishonor of his house, was very glad to have that subject of revenge, a∣gainst his sister, whom he extremely hated, fail'd not to surprize them in bed together, conducted by perfidious Callias, who knocking at the door of the outward Chamber, where lay the Nurse, he waked her, and having told her that he had some business of importance to her, the poor wo∣man opened it unto him, and was amaz'd, to fee the Prince come in with her son, and eight or ten men following him. Wonder not mother said the traytor to her, Prince Demonax is adver∣tised of a disorder which the Princess uses, where∣of he knows you are not guilty: deliver me the key of her Chamber, for he intends to finde her in bed with her minion. The Nurse, more dead, than living, for thus seeing herself by her own son betrai'd, aplying herself to the Prince, Alas Sir said she, what can your sister Orixa have done? nay, can you have any ill opinion of her honor? Sweet heart answered Demonax, be not you trou∣bled, I know you are free: give me but the key,
and you shall see you are betray'd as well as we, and that my sister hath dishonored your grave conduct, as well as her own birth. Piroxenus, whose errant there, was not to sleep, although they spake with voices low enough, heard a con∣fused noise of words, and thought at first, the Nurse was talking to some of the Princess wo∣men, who were come it may be to watch with her in the outward Chamber: but when he per∣ceived they came neer the door, and that the key was put into the Lock. Ah Madam, cry'd he out, we are discover'd, we are betrayed, and with∣out giving the Princess leave to answer him, lea∣ving his night Gown behinde him, which would but cumber him, besides, that he had not the lea∣sure to take it with him, he made but two springs from the bed to the window: and just when as his foot was on the first stop of the Ladder to save himself, Demonax came in, who seeing the poor Lover flying with incredible haste: Take him, take the gallant, but take him alive, said he, if possible, that justice may be done upon him. Presently, three of them went to go down the Ladder, to obey the command; but Piroxenus who carried his sword in his hand, had so much reason left him, as in going down, to cut as many of the rounds of the Ladder, as he could; in so much as those who followed him finding no footing, fell from the top to the bottom; and had so ill speed, as one of them burst out his brains, and tother two so crusht their bones, as that our Lover had good leasure to get to his Lodging.
Meanwhiles, Orixa was in wofull case. That most unhappy Lover, seeing herself surprized so, and no way able to deny an action, whereof there was such testimony: being with shame confoun∣ded, and possest with horror, believing that her Nurse had betrayed her, instead of replying to Demonax abuses, and endeavouring to disswade him by entreaties, she furiously beholding him, snatch'd at a Daggar by his side, & having taken it, thou cruell Tiger, and unnatural, whom once I called Brother, I will glut thy rage, said she; and since the losse, thou think'st, my honor hath sustain'd, must be accompanied with my lifes ca∣tastrophe, I shall at least have thus much comfort, that my own hands shall be my executioners: which said, she would have stab'd herself, but was prevented by the Prince, and those of his company, whose power, she was not able to resist. That night therefore they kept her safe, during which time she uttered complaints, which might have mov'd the most inhumane hearts; and I believe, the Prince himself, whatever hatred he had borne her, or purpose taken to revenge him∣self, had sure relented, if he had remaiued in the Chamber: But he retir'd, because her tears should not importune him, and in his person would take order for imprisoning Piroxenus, and left the sorry Lady in the custody of five or six, who gladly would have hazarded their lives for hers, if so their duties and their faiths would have per∣mitted them. The traytor Callias, had no mind to stay a∣mong them; he too much fear'd the Princess accu∣sations,
and his mothers curses: that poor woman seeing her Mistress in such case, though she were no way made a party in her crime, would yet ac∣cuse her self, and die with her, left being free, and her son author of the Treason, her sidelity might be suspected. Bind me, said she, to those that kept her, I am as guilty as Orixa; and might it please the gods, the little life I have might sa∣tisfie for both our crimes: yea cannot spare me without cruelty, nor think I can out-live her life, who only is the cause I care to live. No Mo∣ther, no, said one of them, Callias hath cleared you sufficiently, and we perceive, what ere you say, proceeds from your affection to the Princess, & your true feeling of her great misfortune. The Prince hath too great justice to entangle you in her mischance, however you desire to follow her. But notwithstanding all their reasons, she was so resolv'd to taint herself of guilt, by tearing off her hair, and knocking her brest, as the unfortunate Orixa though so troubled, knew she had no hand in that foul treachery, and that her son alone was author of it: she therefore in her rage, had so much wisedom, as not to destroy her, but beheld her with mixt eyes, of love, and fury. Then as an instant cursing her ill fortune, which had lead her to the push of losing life, and honor both together, she spake to those that watched her, and with wrung hands, and watred eyes, conjured them, that if they had not heart enough, or rather piety, to kill her, they would at leastwise, suffer her own hands, to do that last act on her, and prevent thereby the shamfull death was threatned
her. When as she saw she obtain'd nothing, and that her begging drew no other issue from them, than their tears: refuse me not however said she to them this request, to tell me where my husband is, or what's become of him; that if he be in safety, I may dying have this consolation, that I leave the sweetest half of life behinde me. Whiles she uttred those complaints, they heard the languish∣ing voices of those who had been lamed by their falls, and suddainly they ran to see, and found them in the miserable case I mentioned, and one of them was dead, whom at first sight they took for Piroxenus: but when they found he had saved himself, they went to acquaint the Prince there∣of, who taking me for the offender, presently be∣sets my Lodging, where he assur'd himself I was retir'd, as in truth Piroxenus, naked as he was had done; and indeed he much amazed me, when suddainly he brake my sleep, and told me how his amorous robberies had been discovered; but said he, because they have not known me, you will be more concern'd than I, and I much fear lest you be here surpriz'd, and may not have the time to justifie your self. Save you then my dear Anaxander, for tis you alone they seek; and when you shall be safe, I will go tell the King my name, and save the Princess life, and honor, by presenting him my self, his son. I well liked his counsell, but also, scarce were my cloaths half on to execute it, when Demonax acompanied with a hundred of the Guard brake open my door; and without holding at my rea∣sons, bound me and carried me to prison, leaving
Piroxenus free, who kept a tearing, and a raving without being understood. I was a hundred times about to tell them who I was, and how the mat∣ter had been carried: but I considered, that if they should not give me credit (as no doubt is, but that a man to save his life will use a hundred slights) that besides unprofitably I should disgrace my blood, I should embroil my friend for whom I had been taken; so that because I lov'd him better than my life, and valued his preservation above my own, I freely confessed the crime, and was resolved to die, not knowing how to hinder it. As soon as it was day, the Princes went to tell the King, of this unhappy action, and presently the noise of it ran through the City; I will not dwell here, Madam, on the sorrows, and afflicti∣ons of the Queen, when she knew the lamentable case to which her only daughter was reduc'd; that daughter, whom so dearly she had loved, and whose vertue she had had so many former proofs of. Surely she with exceeding tears lamented the losse of her life, but much more griev'd she for her wounded reputation. Meanwhile because the crime which was but too certain, might not be long unpunished, the King, relinquishing all fatherly affection, left his daughter to the Law, which did condemn her to be burnt alive, with him who was convicted for enticing her. The Pile was therefore fitted in the middle of the great place, which made all the inhabitants of Visaporus tremble with horror; because,
though such a Law had been a long time since established, it never had been executed, but on her for whom it was first made, which was a sister to one of their Kings, who had about threescore and ten years past been burnt, for falling in love with one of her Domesticks, whom she married secretly; and this was the first example they had ever seen; for that the other was so long ago, as that the eldest man among them scarce remem∣bred it. Meanwhiles provision was a making for that wofull Tragedy, wherein Orixa and my self were to be Actors; Piroxenus, who was not accused, and might if he pleas'd avoid all difficulties, not enduring I should be expos'd to death, for an of∣fence of Love, whereof himself alone was guilty, Went and cast him down at the Kings feet, and there accus'd himself, as he who had seduc'd the Princess, and protested, that he was of Royall blood, and that he was both great, and rich e∣nough to merit her, with multiplied oaths, endea∣vouring to perswade him of my innocence. But the Kings trouble, and the rage that ruled him, admitted not his justifications, nor intreaties. He once knew well enough, that I was he whom the Princess had made choice of for her husband, and collecting by Piroxenus discourse, that he had also got into her favours. What, how said he, that Whore has not been satisfi'd with one, but given herself over to this other also, to a∣swage her lust, there needs no other proof than his confession, he condemns himself, let him be bound, and all three cast into one fire.
The Prince Arazus, who was neer him when be pronounc'd this sentence, had still unto that unfortunate day, maintain'd inviolable his affe∣ction to us, which in severall occasions he had testifi'd; and, Madam, I confesse that being in such favour with him, we did very ill, not to make known our selves unto that gentle Prince, who doubtless had shewn favour to my friends desires, and liked the design of our exchange un∣to the Princess, who bestowed her love on me in vain. But Heaven deny'd it, and Piroxenus still was so respectfull of Orixa, and so fearfull of dis∣pleafing her, that notwithstanding I perswaded him, he dar'd never to declare himself, expecting alwayes that good office from me, who was in truth even ready to have done it, when as this mischance surpris'd us. Araxus now, who lov'd us yet, and would have been glad that Piroxenus reasons were found true, as well for what concern'd his Sister, as his love to us, turned towards the King his eyes, be∣wraying mercy, and compassion; and when hee would have spoken, not in our excuse, but to at∣tempt at lest to have our execution deferred, un∣till tryall might be made, whether Piroxenus words were true or no. How said the King, art thou so simple to believe, that those, who have not wanted impudence to do me such affronts, do want invention to coyn lies? if this bold man were born a Prince, would he not in wayes of honour have sought for my alliance, and would he have so long remain'd a∣mong us, in a private quality, without so much
as making known himself, to her, whom he con∣fesseth so perfidiously to have dishonoured. No, no Araxus, I see thy sister is a strumpet, and that undoubtedly, those two deceivers, are not the only men that have had knowledge of her. But, Sir, reply'd Araxus, you may please to consider, that this man accuses himself of the of∣fence as only Author of it, and willingly presents himself to die to save his friend, whose innocence he offers to make good. O impudent man said the King, who will defend a fellow taken in the manner; If he comes to accuse himself, see'st thou not it is the just permission of the Gods, who wrought so much his conscience to remorse, and will not have so fowle a crime unpunished. Know Araxus, that the Conscience is a marve∣lous thing, and that for want of other witness it often shews it self against our selves. Poor Pi∣roxenus looking pittifully upon Araxus, would again implore his aid, and make reply to the great wrong the King had done him; But that he had scarce opened his mouth, when the King transported with indignation; take the Impostor, said he, from my presence, and dispatch him with the rest. Then was he carried to a Prison, till the hour of execution, and more tormented for my loss than for his own; and when that mournfull time was come, (surely I shake for horror to remem∣ber it,) before we parted from the Prison, they read the sentence of our condemnation, and in∣stantly the Hangman took us, and all three were bound fast in one Chariot, which was compas∣sed
about with Halberts, and other Officers of Justice, so conducted to the Pile, where, by that cruell. Element we were to be devour'd. For reconciling of our Consciences, three of the ablest Bramins of the Indes were allowed us. They did their duty in perswading us to fit for death, assuring us the mercy of the Gods, and promising a thousand spotless pleasures after this life ended. Piroxenus, from the Prison to the place of exe∣cution, dared not once to turn towards us, nor to speak one word, so much cause he found himself of our destruction: His sorrows had al∣ready even as much consumed him, as if he had endur'd the flames, so much he griev'd, that 'twas not his power, by death to expiate a crime by him committed, and with his blood, redeem the loss which he had caus'd, of those he loved more than all the world. But surely, Madam, in so great extremity, I could not chuse but wonder at Oriaxes courage, and her resolution, who being still abused with the belief she had, I was her husband, not able, (being bound,) to cast her arms about my neck, leaned her head upon my face to give me her last kiss; and seeing that I shew'd but little joy at that her testimony of perfect love, which even in dy∣ing she then gave me, and that the apprehension may be of the punishment might cause forgetful∣ness of what I ought her: Taxilus, said she, to me, with a strong voyce, and setled countenance, I swear by that same Sun that looks upon us, and which, we shortly shall behold more neer, in
Heaven, that I am no way griev'd to die, since thou in death art my companion. One thing there is alone, that troubles me, and that, to see thee sad, and that thy heart seems not to hold his wonted seat; can it fall out, that neer thy faith∣full Orixa, thou should'st fear death, which ought to be a pleasing passage to a far more happy life? Let us, my Taxilus, out-brave our evil destiny, and take revenge on fortune, which does cross our loves, by shewing her a courage able to make head against her, and a resolution brave enough to undergo our evils. Fair Orixa, made I answer, I invoke even that same Sun, which you have call'd as witness of your courage, that my sadness is not for the fear of death, but from the just affliction I endure, for having as I know abused you: Know you fair Princess, that in Taxilus you have loved an un∣gratefull, undeserving, and perfidious man, who was not worthy of the honour, of so beautious and so brave a friendship, and that it is Cleontus who adores you, and whom the Gods have cho∣sen for your husband: And as for me, behold me not in this small bit of life that rests us, but to say, I do forgive thee Taxilus, and may the Gods allow thy soul to rest in peace with us. The poor Princess, who was praepossest with that strong imagination, that on me she had be∣stowed her embraced, marvelously strucken at the change, and that of love there came not one word from me; Ah Cruell, said she, that in the case thou art, so neer to yeeld the Gods a rec∣koning of thy actions, doest not apprehend their
justice? thou miserable, dost thou then now de∣ny me, because thou canst no longer have me? wilt thou by scorn revenge thy death, which my love causes thee? Ah how ill doth this wicked∣ness become thy sex, to leave me in extremity, as if 'twere sin agaist the Gods, to love a maid that is unfortunate? Can those be the effects of all thy promises, and of thy faith, which thou so oft hast sworn me: thou should'st, somuch have reverenc'd the memory of thy faithfull Orixa, as to have lov'd her after death, and have preserv'd for ever, her Idea in thy heart; but see, thou giv'st her to another, when she can be thine no longer, and for a recompence of that incomparable love which made her hold thee deerer than her ho∣nour, or her life, thou wilt not suffer her to dye in patience: Thou art not barely pleas'd, to take the only comfort from me, which, I dying, had to flatter my self with, of thy pure constancy, but wilt accuse thy self of treachery, and want of faith, to kill my constancy, and resolution, that in deep despair I may depart this life. I would have spoken, to have dispossest her of that hard belief, and pacifie her thoughts; but that I scarce had uttered the first word, to justi∣fie my self, when with a fiercer, and a more in∣censed voice, preventing me: No, no, thou hi∣pocrite, said she, thou double-hearied, thankless, and forsworn Taxilus, thou art industrious, at the price of innocent Cleontus life, whom, most injustly thou accusest, to preserve thine own: I call the Gods to witness, that he never knew me, and that thy self, art only guilty of the crime, for
which, we are all three condmned. Thou, may be, thinkest, that those holy men who hear us, may by thy lies, be drawn to credit thee; and when thou basely bast turn'd all the fault upon thy harmless friend, who maketh no defence, thinkst to be free. But though they were so cre∣dulous as to believe thy words, and that it hap∣ned, (which the gods forbid) that thou shouldst scape the hangmans hands, I vow thou shouldst not save thy self from mine; and if before I die I had not leave to strangle thee, my ghost shall never leave to haunt thee. More she would have said, but that her sorrow, and her rage, made her insensible; her eyes and judgement strayed, and her heart and voice, at once did fall her in the passions of her anger. Meanwhiles, the Charior which kept alwaies going, was come neer the Pile, and those that guided us, as well the Bramins, as the Hngmen, were so courteous, as to leave that miserable Princess in her swounding, being more willing, for the pitty they were touch'd with, that her grief should kill her, than that fire, which was already kindled, and mov'd horror in all those, that did behold the fear fill spectacle. But Ladies, for the sequel of this History is yet long, and that the hour is la; may you be plea∣sed, I defer the prosecution till to morrow? the two Princesses who were equally inflam'd to know the rest, seeing the Moon so favourable to their entertainment: go on, go on, Anaxander said they, and do not fear our late stay here will cause us scandal; for we sometimes, spend a good
part of the night, as scarless of the air, as our do∣mesticks who are acquinted with the pleasing freedom, of our secret entertainment. No crea∣ture hears us, nor is there entred in the garden, but a little Page, who holds a Torch, ready to light us at the door, when we return unto our chambers. Wherefore the Prince, seeing there was no danger in so long communication, shew∣ing all due obedience to the Princesses, proceeded thus in his discourse.
THE INDIAN HISTORY OF ANAXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The third BOOK. THe customary prayers for our souls, before they cast us into the fire, were begun, when as that Bramin which had serv'd the Princess, and who since her comming to herself, had leasure to cast, about his sight, look'd earnest∣ly into my face, which formerly he had not done; and being he had spent all the last year in the King my fathers Court, where he had opportu∣nity enough to note me, Unfortunate Prince,
said he to me, (for doubtless if my eyes deceive me not you must be Anaxander, son and only heir unto the great Alcidaris King of Guzarat) what desparation, may have made you hide your name, and birth, and so prefer a shamefull death before a happy Marriage. Born as you are, a Prince, and above all I know, accomplished; this Kingdome Laws, have no pretension to your life, since you are he, who have enjoy'd the Prin∣cess favours. Boldly then shew your self, for tis yet time, and with one word, believe me, you may save her life, and honour, and your own. I was exceedingly indeed surpriz'd, for being known; for thought it would have troubled me enough to die, it would much more have grieved me to live, with such an infamy, as to have matri∣ed a wife, who had been bedded by another, and who had nere been thought upon by me; the last consideration therefore ruled me, and thus I an∣swered him. Good father, you are not the first that have mistaken me for the Prince Anaxander, a whole City have been deceiv'd as well as you; for com∣ming out of Persia, whence originally I am, a∣bout some twelve, or fifteen months since, with a purpose to ee all the Indes, and especially these parts, where I imagin'd not to finde such barba∣rism, I passed through the great City of Campa∣nol, where King Alcidaris holds his Court, and was amaz'd t see that every body saluted, and made me great obeysance as I pust the streets. To be short I found they took me for the Prince, and even the King himself who saw me was transpor∣ted
at the great resemblance, and detained me there, some while with him, and sent me after∣wards away with costly presents. No, No, said he to me, no halting before Cri∣ples, I am no whole City, I have but two eyes; but you cannot deceive me, for you are even the same I mean, nor hath the apprehension you may have of death, so changed you, but that I know you Anaxander, and desery the fraud of your disguisement; For howsoever, should you not be glad, to be esteemed such a one, as if it did not wholly save, it might at least prolong your life; and see I not, that you deny your self for nothing else, but through a brute aversion in you to contractia Princess whom you have abus'd: but I profess unto you Anaxander, that her life, and honor, and contentment, are more dear to me than your chimeraes. And therefore Gentle∣men said he, to the Guard, while went by the Chariot, go tell the King, that for the honor of hi-daughter and his house, tis sit to stop the ex∣ecution, and that I have found out a truths which doubtlesly will ravish him with joy. Then instantly one of the Troop went to ad∣veruse the King hereof, and in the interim some went to a Fountain which was in the great place, for water to cast into the Princess face, who was scarce come out of her swounding, when a Cap∣tain of the Kings Guard, accompanied with an unknown old man, divided the throng with an incredible diligence, crying withall their might, to have the execution stay'd, hold, the King com∣mands it.
Immediately a very great noise was moved through the whole assembly, and followed with great acclamations of joy; for there was not one of all the company who was not touched at our fortune, and shed not tears for our distress. And surely all were much amazed at the comming of the Captain of the Guard for our deliverance, for that the officer who went to advertise the King, was but then gone, and all men thought he must have had some notice from elswhere; which not∣withstanding, had not secur'd our lives, had not the Bramin, so much observed me, as to know who I was, and sure this last means had arriv'd too late, for that there was not any ceremony more, which might retar'd the execution. As soon as the Captain (whom they made room for,) was advanced, as far as where we were, the old man who accompanied him, did all he could to cast his arms about my neck; but not able to reach me for that the Chariot was somwhat high. Anaxander said he, my dear Anaxander, my Prince, and Sovereign Lord, what evill for∣tune hath guided you to this sad place, and you dear Piroxenus, what have you done to have de∣serv'd this cruell usage. My dear children, for so may I call you, since from your infancy you have had under me your education: is it a dream, or reall act of your ill destiny? which makes me finde you in this lamentable taking; and after such a tract of infinite misfortunes, which have crost me since your absence, is it possible, the gods would give me this much happiness to see you ere I die, and guide me to this Country, at
the instant when you must have otherwise been put to death. You may imagine (Madam) whether I were surpriz'd, finding it was the wise Evander who spake to us, whom the King my father had or∣dain'd our Governor, and unto whom, I bare as great repect as if he had been my father. Where∣fore, howsoever much I was afflicted, and not∣withstanding any resolution I had taken to con∣ceal my self, I could not chuse but shew him to∣kens of my friendship, and answer with my tears, that tenderness of his: so that none doubted but I was the man, for whom indeed the Bramin took me. Piroxenus who till then, had neither wept nor said one word, because the greatness of his grief had drown'd his senses, and shut up the powres of his soul; waking as from a most deep sleep, by the found of Evanders words, and seeing they were like to be delivered from that danger hich he thought inevitable, or that at least, their deathshould be deferr'd, he somewhat recollected his spirits, and exchanging tears and kinde em∣braces with the old man, he did for him, what for Orixa, he could not. The Princess only, remain'd silent, as of all most surprized, and amazed, and through won∣derfull displeasure she conceiv'd at my denying her, had her whole mind astonish d; and though she were recover'd from her swounding, yet the freedom of her actions was so hindred, as she could, nor comprehend, nor relish any testimony which was given before her, of our births.
The Captain of the Guard, whom the King had sent us, was not in less amazement, than our selves, to see a thing so strange, and extraordina∣ry. He had till then, given such way unto E∣vanders passion, as he had not dar'd to hinder his embraces, or his tears; but when he saw us silent, and in admiration of our misfortunes look∣ing one upon another, he came, and with this complement saluted me. Great Prince, said he, for such we now ac∣knowledge you, and soon enough the Gods have by this sage old mans arivall cleer'd the truth of your extraction. The King my Master hath in his behalf commanded me to wait on you, and tell you, that enough, he cannot wonder, why you should choose death, rather than his alli∣ance, which so many Princes have made sute for. That to excuse the usage you have had, he thinks not fit; seeing by concealing your names, and blood, and having knowledge of the Kingdom; Lawes, you have your selves occasioned the trou∣ble you leave had, and may accuse no other. And besides, he hopes, you will acknowledge what degree he holds among the Asian Mnarchs, and that if for his daughters love you will not, at lest for love of him, and honour to his quality, you will repair the fault committed by a lawfull mar∣riage. Mean while he hath commanded me, to guide you and your friend to certain lodgings in his Palace. I would not trouble my self to give him any answer, because it could avail me nothing, I on∣ly followed him where he conducted me, and we
parted from Orixa, both Piroxenus, and my self; not daring to say ought unto her, for fear of grieving her a new, or waking of her anger: This most unhappy Princesse in despair, for that her crime was known to all the world, and for affronts so publickly receiv'd; but more again for my pretended infidelity, which she could not possibly forget, would not be carryed to her Chamber, and her extreme affliction reduc'd her to such pass, as that a thousand times she griev'd for leaving the fire behind her as the only com∣fort left her, and solt remedy to end her mise∣ries. I was impatient to entertain Evander, that I might as well learn from him, who, so happily had thither guided him, as to be told some news from Guzarat; and the good man who had the same desires, to be at freedom with us, as soon as we repos'd a little, and had rested in the lodgings were allowed us, to satisfie my curiosity, began in this sort his discourse: My deer Children, (for so, although ye be my Lords, and Masters, I from hence conjure yee to allow my age, and deer affection, to call ye) ma∣ny sad tears, and sighs your absence hath drawn from me, and little rest, and comfort have I had, since that unhappy day ye stole so inconsiderately from the King of Cambaya's Court, where ye were adored of all, how are the Gods most just, in sending ye the troubles ye have had, to punish ye in some sort, for afflicting those, who brought ye into the world, and with such tender care have bred ye up.
Know then my Children, that as soon as your departure was discovered in Campanel, the King affcted both with grief and anger, having been told, how that same night wherein ye had de∣parted, a Ship had gon out of the Port of Cam∣baye, and made her course towards the Coast of Zeilan, he doubted, (by reason of hot Wars late made in that Countrey against the King of Mal∣dives,) that ye might have thither gone, to seek occasions, whereunto your Courage called ye: for this cause he immediately sent after that great Vessell two light Saylers, from two divers Ports, and sent as well to seek ye, over land. But long they were not without newes from her which they thought had carryed you away; for she was scarce gone out of the Gulf of Cambaye, to enter into the great Arabique Sea, when threatned by a tempest, and finding her self neer the Heaven of Bazaim, which is one of the securest of that shore, the Pilots thought it fit to cast Anchor there, and shelter themselves so long, as till the storm were over. This stay gave opportunity to that Post, who had been sent from Campanel to Bazaim, to send out a Ship, to meet that same which had put all the Court in trouble: But when it was known, that you were not therein; rage in the King, in∣creast so much, and the Levity of your flight, touch'd him so to the quick, as all the love he bare ye, he turn'd to hate and indignation. I went about to tell him how I had from certain pieces of your discourse with one another in your privacies, collected, that ye, had purposed a voyage to Narsinga, and told him 'twould be
very good to send there after you; and that in case you were not met upon the rodes, it would be very fit to dispatch an Embassader to the King of Narsinga, that at least ye might not pass as un∣known people, but be receiv'd like Princes. No, no, Evander (said he to me) they have shewn themselves unworthy of m care or trouble, and I am asham'd, for having so much already grie∣ved my self for them; let thm even pass for inch as they will, There declare my self from hence∣forth not to own them: Come, go with me into the Queens closet, and you shall see that Anax∣ander hath play'd more the fool than he is ware of; The Gos be thank'd I have another Child; and Heaven is just in robbing me of him whom I alone did love, and upon whom I built all my de∣light and hope. As soon as we were come into the Queens Ca∣binet, the King caus'd Pirobus to come unto him, who had negotiated his last marriage with that fair Princess, who brought you into the world, and who had alwayes served him so faithfully; And sure I was exceedingly amazed, when tur∣ning to the Queen, he made her in our presence this discourse. Madam, (said he to her,) I know the sorrow you conceive for your Sons Levity is so great, as that to understand he were no more alive, would no more grieve you, than his slight: wherefore, because it cannot add a jot unto your present for∣row, I intend to tell you of a thing which does exceedingly concern me, and which these twen∣ty years I have conceal'd from all the world, and most especially from you.
You may remember, Madam, when first I sent you Pirobus in Embassage, to seek you for my wife, you, after having courteously received him, gave him an answer somewhat cold, by framing an excuse touching your brothers death, (Spi∣mantus,) who because he had been dead two years before, finding that reason insufficient to oppose my just demand, he was desirous to in∣struct him better in your truer meanings, and understood by one of your chief States-men, that the sole consideration which you stuck on, was, that by the Queen Berenisa, my first wife, I had a Son; and that my heir already born, you would not suffer that your Children, should be second in affection, or degree to any: This being return'd me by my faithfull Pirobus, I seem'd to take no notice of it: but after some time was past, wee both agree'd together, that if I meant to compass my desire in that sute, where-on depended all my happiness, I must needs send away, my Son, and spread a noyse that he was dead. And judge you, Madam, to what extremity I loved you, be∣ing compell'd to take so contrary a resolution to the lawes of nature. For this cause, I comman∣ded a Coffin to be laid (with Royall pomp) into the earth, and suffered none, in forty dayes to see me, that I might better act the part of a lost Father. Mean while I gave my Son in charge to Pirobus, whose name was like mine own, Alci∣daris, not to be sent so far away, but that I might, when I desir'd, hear often of him. He had ac∣quaintance with an Arabian Merchant, and an honest man, named Eurimedes, who was most fre∣quent
in the City of Deu, one of the best havens of my Kingdom, and teaded to Cambaye, where at that time he was. To him he went, and gave that pledge into his custody, which for your love I had abandoned; He told the Merchant, how he had receiv'd that child from a woman of great quality, commended him to his best cate, and that he might be bred among his own, and told him, one day it m ight happen, that a worthy re∣compence might grow unto him; In the inferior, because he might be known again, and for he had no mark about him, Pirobus made one upon his arm, where he imprinted the Arms of Cambaye with a needles point, and the joyce of a certain herb wch never wears away; which done, he does again commend him to the Merchant, whom, that he might the better love the child, and be more carefull of him, he enjoyned to beslow his own name of Eurimedes upon him; In so much, as very often I have heard of him, & also known the Merchants care, as well for the great py cause him every year to receive, as for the love he bears to Pirobus, to whom he thinks he is oblig∣ed for that favour. But Madam, (said the King moreover,) the Gods can bear me witness, I had tane your deer Anaxander into so great affection, as I forgot the love I ought his Brother; and if he had well be∣hav'd himself, I think, his humor, which beyond all others that I know, delighted me, together with my wonderfull affection to your self, had so much won upon me, as I had made him heir to all my three Crowns: but seeing he hath shewn him∣self
so giddy-headed, and so ill advised, as to leave me, to pursue his foolish fantasies, as well as his Cousin, whom so deerly I had loved, having no other prop to rest on, left me; Think not a miss, Madam, that I send Pirobus to Diu, to seek me out Alcidaris, 'tis now no longer fit, he should be hid, nor that on my part, I should more con∣ceal the love I bear my proper Son. These, my deer children, said Evander, are the very words the King himself delivered, who, without alteration at the Queens complaints, and tears, dispatched Pirobus immediately. Being ariv'd at Diu, he wonderfully amazed the Mer∣chant, when he told him that ye child whom he so long had bred, was heir unto the King; The noise hereof was spread incontinently through the City, and all the inhabitants came in throngs to kisse their Princes hands. Pirobus who had not seen him, since his first delivery into the Mer∣chants hands, could know him only by the mark he graved on his arm. The young man more than any other grew in admiration at the honors which were done him: For he believ'd, he was that Merchants son, and look'd for nothing lesse, than to be honor'd as a Prince. He was by Pirobus conducted to the City of Campanel, and carried both the Merchant and his children with him, on whom he afterward caus'd goodly Offices to be conferred. As soon as his arrival was but known, the greatest of the Court went forth to meet him, and the King with testimonies of exceeding joy received him, but this did not long endure: For that young
Prince was so ill bred, and had among those people of inferiour quality who had kept him, gotten such evill habits, as that his presence ser∣ved but to make you more lamented; but above all, the Queen could not endure, that in your stead, a beast should have such worship, who by his filthy carriage, had made himself contempti∣ble to all the world. The King commanded me to take him to my Government: But finding in him no appearance of common sense, and seeing him too old to form his mind to any good; I did despair ever to make of him a civill man; and you may think my dear children, whether I finding in that poor Prince spirit, nothing but thornes and briers, in∣stead of goodly seeds of vertue, which I found in you, I had great cause to be delighted with my charge. The King, who in that ill made Picture, could not know himself, made Pirobus a thousand times to swear he was the same which he had from him. As for my self, seeing I lost my labour, and my time in teaching him, besides the finall d fire, or none at all I had thereto, being afflicted as I was for losse of you, and dreaming nothing sse than ere again to see you: I ath, last, resolv'd to go and seek ye out in what part of the World so∣ever ye might be. And that which more old god me thereto was, that knowing all the seces of Astrology, and having by that Art foreseen, that at two severall times ye should run hazard of a violent death, I would make tryall if by my di∣ligent and carefull seeking after you, I might di∣vert
the mischiefs which the Srs had threatened ye withall. Besides my own affection there∣unto, I was incited by the general complaints of all the better sort of people in the Kingdom, who could not without sorrow yield obedience to a Prince of so ill making, and so evill doings, and who already did begin to apprehend his future domination. Therefore as soon I had known, no news was to be hd of you at sea, and that as many as had gone after you, were come again no wiser than they went; remembring I had in secret heard your meditations on the Princess Oriza's Picture, and that I had often heard ye, though in and out, to name the word Narsinga, I imagined you might be gone disguised thither, and have passed over land, that you might crosse through that unhappy Kingdom of Decan, whereof I remembred to have heard you mention so many wonders of their gallantry: But unfor∣tunate as ye are, by what I see, ye have met no∣favored me, by my arrivall here at Visaporus, just when you were about to die a shamefull death, that I might turn from off you, one of those blows, your evill destinies had threatned you withall. See Madam, what discourse Evander enter∣tain'd us with, which set my thoughts into as great confusion, as they were but two hours be∣fore; for I believ'd I was Alcidaris his only son, and much it angred me, a fool should be my elder brother: However I cheer'd up my self; in
hope or one day having the fair Kingdom of Dulcinda, which could not be taken from me. And however, I despaired not of gaining others, which my courage, and my sword did promise me. But as on our parts we were recounting our adventures to the wise Evander, who much bla∣med us (after having told him of Orixas loves, and the change we us'd towards her) for not re∣vealing our selves to the Prince Araxus; a Page came to advertise us, the King was comming to see us in our Chamber: I was a little surprized at it, because I foresaw already what would be the issue of that visit: However Piroxenus and I com∣posing our selves as well as we could, we went forth to meet him; and after mutuall salutations, he began, and thus said to me. I much admire, Sir, that being born as you are, and for our neighbourhood, knowing my great∣ness, and my Lordship of the famous Potts of Chaul, and Goa, which adjoyn to yours, you would chuse rather death, than my alliance, when you had first abused my daughter, who had been alwaies till your comming hither, the pat∣tern, both of honor, and of vertue. I finding his discourse grew to be long, and that he went on reproaching me, and excusing himself for the violence had been shewen us, sud∣dainly interrupted him, to tell him every cir∣cumstance that passed; I told him of the passi∣onate affection Piroxenus bare the Princess his daughter; how that he was my Conzin germain, and the only heir unto the Kingdom of Citor;
how he had borne so great respect unto her, as not to dare declare himself her husband, though never any save hithself had known her; how when he saw things grown to such extremity as they were, and me condemned for his fault, he went and cast himself at his Majesties feet, who would not hear him: At length, I so far perswa∣ded him, as having appear'd his spirit, and freed him from the trouble which his former rage had put him in, he relished my reasons, which he found most just and likely; and taking us by the hand, that he might suddenly finish Piroxenus Marri∣age, he lead us to the Princess Chamber, who was very sick a bed, and by her, sat the Queen in tears. Although amid so many accident, and mis∣fortunes, her soul were laden with profound and fearfull thoughts, the spite she had conceiv'd against me; had not gained so much over her, but that her wasting body, was still battered with love; whose heat joyning to that of her Feavor, kindled so great and violent a five within her, as Physicians did despair already, ever to be able to quench it. Seeing me come into her Chamber, and the King her father leading me by the hand, believing he was come to confirm our Marriage, and that it had been done more through compassion of her friends, than of my own good will; the tears ran in her eyes, and to conceal the passion which surprized her, she turn'd her head the other side. My daughter, said King Demonax unto her, be∣hold your husband whom I bring you; and
would it had so pleased the Immortall gods that I had had but patience enough, to have understood the truth of a History, which will no less amaz: your self, than me; we should not then have had the labour to oppose our Laws against you, nor threaten with a shamefull punishment your life, and honours, which at once I now do warrant you. Know, if as yet you do not know, that those two Knights who have been condemned with you, are sons to the most puissant Kings of India: this same said he, pointing at Piroxenus, has the Kingdom of Citor already in possession, and is Ceuzin germain to this other, who lives in hope after the death of Alcidaris to reign over the Em∣pire of Guzarat. They have not only chang'd their names, but their hearts also; and he who you, as you believed chose for husband, was ne∣ver yours, more than for manners sake, or for civi∣lity, but hath in that good fortune given his Cou∣sin place, who only, for his marvellous affection to you, merits your possession: Turn your self towards me, think no more of what is past, for which I am more sorry than your self, and hence forth studying but to please your self, receive with courtesie your real husband, whom I here present you. Here at the Princess turn'd her face towards the King, and seeing it twas Piroxenus he presented her; How Sir, said she to him, that impostor then is constant in denying me, after renouncing of himself to quite undo me; and you believe him? and I shall be so miserable, as that you will put off your common knowledge to be overta∣ken
by his lies? she would have prosecuted her reproaches, when Piroxenus, who till then had not dar'd speak a word, emboldning him by pre∣sence of the King, who favoured his love, took liberty to interrupt her, and casting himself down at her feet, he fram'd her this discourse. Madam, said he, though you should heap your scorns upon me, and all my life I should repent me of my rashness, yet I finde fit I should no lon∣ger hide it from you, but make known the errour, you till now have been in. Know fair Orixa, that I have never loved any, save your self, and that the meer consideration of my love, and of your beauty, hath compelled me to keep Anax∣ander so long in this Country; we have between us both, but one desire, and one affection: where∣fore I having learnt by him, that your unhappy Inclination carried you to bear him love, who was already gaged in affection to another, I con∣jur'd his help, and favour to my sute; he had compassion on me, and admitted me instead of him, and that which by good forune I was not able to deserve, I got by subtility. Love, (fair Orixa) made me bold to deceive you, blame therefore him, not me, who weak against so strong a Master, was compelled to yield, and follow him. Twas I whom Callias under favour of the darkness guided, where you look'd for Anaxan∣der; and in short, twas I, who in your Nurses presence, sware to be your lawfull husband, and who made you a thousand protestations of unal∣terable Love, which since I'me sure I never vio∣lated; the fear of death has not been able to do
it, nor shall your scorns of me prevail at all; no, though you should be more cruell to me than the destinies, who have so threatned me with punishments, and though by taking all hope from me of your favour, you should condemn me unto death; I vow I will preserve your love even in my grave, Orixa, and in the second life I look for, make it all my souls contentment, The Princess heard him with attention, and although the dolors of her Feavor were of power enough to take away the liberty of talk, she not∣withstanding, would have forc'd herself to an∣swer him, when by the comming of a Post she was prevented, who after boldly knocking at the door demanded entrance, and admittance to the King for reasons of a high importance, the King commanded him to be brought to him; and truly at first entrance he affrighted the whole company, and ere he spake his countenance be∣wrai'd, that all things went not as they should. Sir, said he to the King, all is lost, even your own subjects have betrayed you. Those wicked slaves to whom you gave in charge the Govern∣ment of your Countries, have made a great As∣sembly of people in the City of Danaget, for to revolt against you, and break off the yoke of your Royall authority, without so much as caring for their children which you have as Hostages. They are all met in one desire to betray you, and divide your provinces: but two among the rest have shewn themselves more wicked than their fellows, to wit, Rozalcan, and Zabain, one of whom you made Governour of Bider, and the o∣ther
of Danaget: For, being Brothers, and al∣waies of a plentifull intelligence, whn they saw those other, their sworne fellows, in a Town whereof they had the Sovereign power, because themselves would reign alone, cut all their throats; and having reassembled all their Forces, and won the greater part of your Subjects, ei∣ther by presents, or fair words, they are com∣ming with a mighty Army against your person, and purpose to besiege you in your City of V∣saporus, that they may absolutely be Masters of your Countries, and without hinderance com∣mand the Empire, which the gods have given to you. You may imagine, fair Princess, whether such an humor as I have describ'd the Kings to be, were surprized with such news. He could not hide his apprehension from us, a deadly paleness disfigured his face; and not finding himself able enough to resist a misfortune which so neerly threatned him, he could not speak a word, when as Araxus, who knew his very heart, ashamed we were witnesses of so much poverty, withdrew him from thence, and told him, twas his way to call his Councill together, and suddainly provide against the present necessities. In the meanwhile, he left us in the Chamber with the Queen, in whose presence the gods permitted, after Piroxenus had recounted to the Princess all the passages of their secret Loves, and that he had by his unfeigned tears given testimony of his in∣nocent affection which ras'd out the crime he had committed, she was somewhat appeased.
Wherefore once more they pledg'd their marri∣age faith to one the other in our presence, they joyned hands, and kist, and from that day, Orixa did begin to love me as a Brother, not a Lover. Although my known innocence had eas'd her spirits of a heavy burden, which in her thoughts of my disdain she under went, her body was bu little sensible thereof, and no abatement of her Feavor was observ'd. But contrary, she was so troubled for the evill next of imminent danger threatned to the King her fathers Countries, newly then arriv'd, together with the cruell blows of former miseries, so over come, as more than ever all the Physicians grew into despair of ever seeing her recovery Meanwhiles this sicknesse lasted, Rozalcan, and Zabain came still onward, and their Army made such haste, as it had almost compassed the City before they had so much as time to furnish a tenth part of what was necessary to sustain a fiege, or that they had enclosed works without, or fortified the approaches. Demonax had under hand, Arms for some thirty thousand men, and Coyn enough; but wanted Souldiers, for his Subject were his enemies; and was so suddenly surpriz'd, as that he had not time, to crave assi∣stance from his neighbours, who were besides but ill affected to him. The King of Maldives only, and of Palandurus his brother in law, could have succor'd him in time, but that ill luck would have it, he but late before had been himself de∣feated, and his Army cut in pieces by the King of
Zeylan, who being assisted by the valour, and wise conduct, of couragious Lisimantus, ahd made himself Lord of all his Islands, except but three or four of Palandurus where he was retired, without other hope of refuge. A midst the trouble which this miserable King was in, he called us into his counsel of War, and crav'd our help; but we represented to him the impossibility thereof, and that there remaining unto him no other retreait but that only City, from whence he was ready to be driven by those, who sought but for his life, to reign without contradiction, we should not be able to bring any succours, though they lay but six daies jour∣ney off, and though we found them ready for the march. And what then, said he to us, must I lose all my hope, and that my children and my self be brought to so cruell a necessity, as to die, or live for ever under the power of base scoun∣drels? By and by he cast out divers blasphemies against the gods, and instantly, caus'd all the childrens throats to be cut, which he receiv'd as Hostages from those slaves. Verily, Madam, we saw not how to give him great comfort, because we found his matters in a desparate condition; However we made a ver∣tue of necessity, and joyned the Princes, his chil∣dren, and we, together with as many Naires, as there were in the Kings Guard, all the inhabi∣tants of Visaporus which were of age to bear Arms, to try if we could raise a power, able e∣nough to do some dammage to our enemies; but they consisted of so great a number, as we
judg'd it more rashnesse than valour, to assault them: we forbare not at the beginning to Skir∣mish sometimes with them, when, there came ma∣ny of theirs too short; but as from an Hydra's head, their seemed alwaies quadruple the number to encrease; so that perceiving our affairs in so ill case to attempt the freedom of the City, Pi∣roxenus, and my self, sent to defie Kozalcan, and Zabain to fight with us; but though, as indeed they were, hardy, and valiant, they were not dis∣pos'd to venture any thing in the condition they were in, and, had they willed to do any thing in single Combate, they would have had to do with the two heirs of that Kingdom. Meanwhile they laid their Batteries against the City, and it was threatned by a quick assault, when the King fearing to fall underhe power of the besiegers, resolv'd at any rate to save himself; and without knowing what would become of him, or where to turn, and without telling any body of his flight, except one of his servants which waited in his Chamber, called Panaris, whom he chose to accompany him, he stole a∣way by night upon a good horse out as a Postern door of the Palace, and carried with him the richest Jewels of his Crown. This persidious Panaris, seeing no way of safety for himself, or Master, being to crosse the Camps, mischievpusly conceived in his heart, to kill the King, and take his Jewels, which doubtlesse would remain as reward to him, when he should carry his head to his enemies. This purpose was no sooner re∣solved on, but put in execution, for when that
poor Prince thought of nothing lesse than Trea∣son from his servant, he was thrown to ground by a thrust made through and through his bo∣dy, and having cut off his head, he carried it to Rozalcan, who was encamped towards the River. Notwithstanding he was a barbarous man, and sought nothing but the death of the King, and his children, yet could not that action chuse but fright him: however he put not the traytor to death, but after having taken his riches from him, was only pleased to forbid him his presence, and no more. He presently advertised his brother Zabain of what had passed, and they thought good to advertise the besieged by a Trumpet, of the Kings death, that they might be the more dis∣heartned, promising them, that if the Souldiers would render themselves, they should depart with bag and baggage, without any hurt done them, and as for the inhabitants of the City, they should quoitly enjoy their lands and houses, on this condition alwaies, that they should de∣liver up the Princes, Araxus, and Demonax, in∣to their hands. The people of that poor distressed City, were so moved at the news of the Kings death, who had so long a time maintained them in peace, as without considering what became of themselves, seeing they yet demanded the Princes of them, to put them cruelly to the sword likewise, fell so furiously upon the Trumpeter, as in an instant they had crusht him, and their rage was so great, as they dismembred him with their teeth, and e∣very one would have a plece. On the other side,
the Queen, whō the apprehension of an approach∣ing ruin had already very much afflicted, having been told of the murther done upon the King her husband, & what was threatned to her children, sound so great a load of sorrow grown upon her, as being not able longer to endure it, she was com∣pelld to submit unto its violence, & soon the gods gave leave that wound should pierce her heart, & took away that life wch was but grievous to her. Meanwhile the Princess Orixa, knew not any thing of these misfortunes, and had already these two daies lost all manner of understanding, and so great was the strength of her disease, as taking from her all appearances of life, she who atten∣ded her came to advertise us how she had fol∣lowed her mother. Orazia exceedingly moved at this conclusion, which she looked should not be so Tragical, Ah, said she to the Prince, in∣terrupting him, the poor Orixa then is dead; truly she should not have dyed, after having past so many troubles. Hear the sequel of the story, Madam, reply'd Anaxander, we are not at the end of our misfortunes yet. As soon as Piroxenus was advertised of this fad accident, he hastily ran to her, and finding nei∣ther Pulse nor motion, in that body which more than his life he loved, he forgat his resolution, and his constancy; and that great courage, which all the injuries of Fortune, and threats of death it self, could not so much as shake, was by that wo∣full spectacle constain'd to yield to his afflicti∣on, and his sorrow; he did at first, all that a man in desperation could devise to do in such
extremities; he tore himself, he cursed heaven, fell out with those that would but comfort him, and when that fury was past over, casting himself upon his knee to worship those pretious reliques of his love, and with a flood of tears bathing the liveless face of the fair Orixa, Unhappy Princess, said he, is it possible, that after so much trouble to obtain thee, I must all the remnant of my life hereafter lose thee, and have the Gods ordain'd, I shall not freely have thee in possession till after death? O my fair mouth, which pale and chan∣ged, or how ever cold your kisses are do notwith∣standing charm me, I must love them yet: Alan, Had I but come before thy last sigh given, I might have clos'd my lips to yours, that that fair soul, which I lament, mightnot have had so free a leave to take her flight. Give me, orixa, leave to fol∣low her, that without mine she may not go: if thou hast any feeling yet of worldly things, stay for thy miserable husband; thou canst not yet be far, direct me quickly which way thou art fled, that I may come unto thee. Much more he would have said, and the ex∣travagance he had already shewn, began afresh, when being call'd to comfort him, I with such language interrupted him: What pleasure, said I, deer Piroxenus, can you take in giving testimony of your weakness, and appear quite loft in pre∣sence even of those who ravish'd with your no∣ble actions past, accounted you a demy God, and without humane frailty: recall, quickly dear friend, recall thy reason, that in our presence, it may disavow, what ever in its absence thou hast
done. Thou knowest not why thou moanest, and art so unhappy, as to give thy self up to de∣spair, when thou should'st rather thank the Gods for so great favour, as to take her from thee, who was ready to be taken by the hands of meer bar∣barians. Imagin she had liv'd; falling into the power of such notorious revolted slaves, who seek but to exterminate the race of Demonax, and where she must have been a prey unto her ene∣mies, what would become of her? ought'st thou not rather to be glad that she is with the Gods, who loved her too well, to let her see her last Town pillaged, her Fathers Murther, and, her Mothers suddain death, with loss of all hee friends in general? Besides these reasons, I administred so many o∣ther, as I somewhat setled his mind, but not being able longer to remain in that sad place, which had been a theatre unto us of so many mischiefs, grief and affliction which had rul'd his heart, gave wrath, and vengeance, at one instant full possession: Lets forth, lets forth Anaxander, said he, out of this unfortunate City, which even af∣frights me; stay we not till the enemies do force it, and be taken among those who must give up themselves unto the mercy of barbarians; let us revenge the Royall blood of Decan, and with the choyce of all the brave, and valiant men among us, powre upon those Traytors, and if we can∣not scape their hands, lets at dear rates sell our lives, and gloriously expire; my blood already boyles with anger in me, and I perswade my self, that rascall rout cannot resist my sury.
I had already made the same overture to the Princes, and told them 'twas the only way which they could try to save themselves, seeing how true it was, they sought but for their lives, and therefore found it no hard matter, to perswade their resolutions thereunto. We therefore pur∣posed to assemble only two or three thousand of the best and ablest men of the City, to make a fully by night upon the enemies out at the Port of Goa, where they wre with least strength en∣trenched; But when the Visaporians knew their Princes went in person, they would all go, and left to guard their walls, women, and children only, and old men, among the which was sage Evander, to whom, what ever good or evill might become of us, we bid farewell, desiring him that if he could get out from thence, he would return to Cambaye; and that he would endevour to re∣gain Alcidaris his favour to us, whom we assur'd him we would see as soon as we had seen a little of Narsinga, in case the Gods preserv'd us in the hazard we were falling into; he therefore with all possible regret imbraced us, because he did be∣lieve, he never more should see us, and much ado we had, to change his wilfull purpose to ac∣company us in that sally. The Princes had design'd to follow us, and go the voyage to Narsinga with us, if we could scape out of the multitude, and for that cause we took for rendezvous, an old decayed Temple, which lies upon the ode to Goa, a league out of the City, but, otherwise the Gods had ordered: for in that memorable issue which we made upon the
enemy, both brothers after great and worthy a∣ctions of their valour by them done, were slain at our fees. As for our selves Madam, we hew'd our way through those that followed us, and slew what ever from that side opposed us. The Moon was lightsome, and heaven so much fa∣voured us, that Pirox nus and I sound our selves neer to one another, and but lightly hurt, poor Neander was wounded with a dart in his thigh, and was carried back into the City, ready to die, that we must go without him, and Almerin who lost not sight of us, pursued us, when we had given Neande charge, and some other of our Souldiers, to spread a moyse, that we were slain with the twoi Princes, lest we might draw a blame upon us, for forsaking the besieged. We there∣fore secretly with-drew our selves else where, not willing to be witnesses of that poor Cities mis∣fortunes, which could not long hold our, and which by the losse of those two Princes, who be∣yond all other reasons had oblieg'd us to that ser∣vice, had lost her finall hope. Three things, be∣fore we went, we recommended to Neander: the first was, that he should not fail to cause the bo∣dies of Demonax, and Araxus, to be buried in their Fathers grave, and that he likewise should be carefull of interring the Princess Orixa their Sister. The second was, that notwithstanding he was hurt, he should not leave the poor besieg∣ed people, who did already want provision, and that he should assist them to make as honourable composition as he could; a thing which we in∣deed held far unfit for us, and which to farther,
the great service they had newly done, would much import. And thirdly, that he should help all he could, the good Evander to return unto Cambaye, and assure him of our safeties; that as for him, as soon as he were whole, he should not fail to come unto us, and that he should hear of us in the King of Narsinga's Court, under the names of Ariomant, and Calistenus, for fear we might be known by those of Taxilus, and Cleon∣tus, and we had given the same directions to the good Evander, before we parted from him. Thus, Madam, left we that unfortunate City, and I must confess the willingness wherewith Pi∣roxenus followed me, without despair, is not the smallest argument of that extreme affection which he bears me. The Image of that unhap∣py Princess presented it self evermore before his eyes, he had no other pleasure than to afflict himself, with the remembrance of her death. That was the sole meditation of his dayes, the only dream of his nights, and the continuall trouble of his soul; and yet among so many peircing griefs, and bloody discontentments, hee compell'd himself to live to bear me company. We then, put off our Arms, and Almerin, who knew full well the Countrey, made us go that night on foot as then we were, & brought us to a little City named Foya, some four Leagues off from Visaporus, upon the rode to Bisnagar, be∣cause he knew that none of Rosalcans Troops lay on that quarter. We found there the inhabitants quite lost, and vext with fear, not knowing of which side to be, not where to rank themselves;
however, after having taught them, that they must give place to force, that all their Princes were dead, and that their great City was threat∣ned with approaching ruin, we, after we were furnished with horses, and what else we wanted, for our money, left them resolv'd to send to∣wards the two usurpers. The wounds we had re∣ceiv'd, did not hinder us from proceeding on∣ward, and therefore we went right to Bisnagar, well provided both of Money and Jewels, to rub through such extremities as might befall us. I will not spend my time (Madam) in relating you all the adventures wch we met on the way, for fear of abusing your patience, I will only mention that wch gave me the honour of your acquaintance, & which was the reason, why at first we were re∣ceived happily into the King your fathers Palace. When we were come within two Leapues of that great City of Bisnagar, where we had learn'd the King made then his six moneths resi∣dence, passing along by a Forest of Palm Trees, in the middle of the rode, which leadeth strait to the City, we spied a hunter of a goodly counte∣nance, and richly clad, who being mounted on a horse, as swift as was the beast he followed, had left his fellow hunters far behind him. Scarce had he passed us an hundred paces, rushing a∣gain into the thick, without more train, than one page only, who never left him, but that a do∣zen Robbers who had lain in ambush in a thicket by the which he passed, cast themselves suddainly upon him, and held his reigns to stop his passage, ere he scarce perceived them; As soon
as he had found himself infested with this rascall rout, nimble and active as he was, he flung him∣self out of his saddle, to the ground, and draw∣ing out his sword, cleaved his head who first a∣borded him; but seeing that hismatch was too hardly made, and that he must at length be o∣vercome, he was resolv'd to sell his life full dear. By good luck, as he passed, we were turned a∣bout towards him, and his rich furniture, caused that curiosity in us, and was the means, that even about the very instant we perceiv'd him in this trouble, we ran unto him hastily, and found the Page thrown to the ground by a hurt in his thigh, and the hunter, sorely wounded, yet ha∣ving set his back against a tree, did most couragi∣ously defend himself. The aid we lent him, re∣doubled his courage, and by good luck for us, it chanced that in less than half an hour, Piroxenus, Almerin and my self, set him at liberty, and slew all those Rogues, excepting two, that had assaul∣ted him; which two, hurt as they were, were bound and carryed to the City: 'twas not with∣out sore hurts that we perform'd that task, and if the Page had not remembred to wind his horn, to call the hunters to that place, who were behind, we had run all of us an hazard to have lost our lives by reason of the blood which streamed in abundance from our wounds. As soon as the brave hunter found himself delivered from that danger, which he never thought to escape: Ye Knights, said he, what ever ye may be, that have so happily come hither, know, 'tis the Prince Arontkus whom ye have saved from the ambush
of those theeves, and is your debtor for his life, and therefore, whether ye be subjects to the King my Father, or else strangers to this Countrey, I promise ye, this reall service shall not be un∣acknowledged, neither shall ye ask me any thing to be deni'd. I presently made answer in the Arabique tongue, that we were Persian Knights, and had resolved to travel through all India, that we had unknowing him, done him that small service, but as honor, and reason both obliged us; But seeing now he had declar'd his name, however grievous our wounds were, we held our selves most highly honor'd to receive them for his sake, and would not waill our lives, were we at point of losing them, since for his preservati∣on they were spent. He hereat us'd his best strength to embrace us, (for he understood the Arabique tongue as well as we did his) and pro∣testing he would never be unthankfull for so great a benefit, urg'd us to make him some re∣quest, which whatsoever it were, within the King of Narsinga's power, he would grant us. But that which most won on his heart, and doubled his affection to us, was the answer which we made him; that we already held our selves too high∣ly recompenced, in as much as our weak help was so acceptable unto him; but that we might not take from him, the pleasure of shewing his brave heart towards us, all the favour we desired, was, that he would cause us to be well accepted in the King his fathers Court, which from far off, we came to see, as most renowned in all Asia, not only for the courage and the freedom of the
Knights thereof, but also for the courtesie and beauty of its Ladies. Truly said he, I do assure your wellcome as mine own, and if the gods al∣low that among us, there any pleasure be, that may detain ye, and that any place, or charge a∣bout the King there be that may become ye, ye shall know the love Aronthus bears ye. Whilest we were on these Complements, the Huntsmen, and the Prince your brothers Gentle∣men came where the horn had called them, they were in great amazement to see their Master in such case, and altogether confounded with shame, dared not come neer him, fearing let the blame of that had hapned to him, he might lay upon the little care they had to follow him: But on the contrary, the generous Aronthus, whose apprehensions evermore inclin'd to sweet∣ness, and never seen to be in angry, spake to them without any trouble, and presently com∣manded them to have a care of us, and him. Relieve said he, my friends, succour those cha∣ritable and generous Knights, who have now newly sav'd my life, and are in danger of their own. The Chirurgian, and the rest fell instant∣ly about their business, and finding, that the Prince was more hurt than we, drest him first, though he forbad him, and though they found a∣bout him seven, or eight cruell wounds, yet nei∣ther of them mortall, no more than ours; They made the best use they could in that necessity of any thing to case us, and fit litters for us, and whiles we were conveighing into the City, we understood from those Rascalls which were
scap'd alive, to pay the debt they ought to Justice, that those thieves which had set upon the Prince, were companions to one Tamurchand, the most famous robber of the Indes, who with those graceless rakehels, retir'd himself into the most fearfull solitude of the Mountains of Gate; and because three or four daies before he had suffied and was hang'd and quartred in the great place of Bisnagar, those raskcals had projected to re∣venge their Caprains death, upon the Princes person, or the King himself, whom they would entrape amid their chase a hunting; and sure they had not made ill bargain with Arontus, if so the gods had not been pleas'd, to send us early to his succour. I cry you mercy, Madam, if in the heat of my discourse, I repeat you things that you have seen, and know as well as I, I couldnot forget the occasion, that gave me the honor of seeing you, and making me acceptable in your sight, and as often as you shall please to give me the freedom of discoursing to you, I think I shall still enterlace it with this story. Ever since that happy day, wherein the Prince Arontus, held us worthy to be lodged in his side of the Kings Palace, you have been witnesse of whatever hath befallen us, and of the honors we have received, under the borrowed names, of Ariomant and Calistenus, among which, your visits have held the best, and most glorious room. Surely, Madam, when by the Prince your brother, you were intreated to come and see us, as his Ramsomers, and that I saw before me the living originall of that preti∣ous
Picture, which inanimate, and dead as it was, had ravisht me at Gouzarate, and whose I∣dea I had alwaies so dearly preserved in my heart, I had much to do to hinder that I died not for joy; my wounds opened at my surprizall by that pleasure unexpected, and the sudden weaknesse which I felt at the losse of my blood; If you remember, Madam, I amazed all the com∣pany, but more your self than any, be it, you felt your self as guilty of my souls disorders, or whether you already would account your self concern'd in my passions. From that instant I perceived, that you rejected not the offers which my eyes made you of my service, and if my quality had been but known unto you, I believe you would have been more bold, to give me from that present, proofs of your affection, & good will unto me. I forbare not, for all I was unknown, as soon as I felt my self well cured of my wounds, to venture so far as to let you know those of my heart, which I believed would not be so quickly healed; I flattered my self with this belief, that you despised not my complements, and love in such sort blinded me, as I perswaded me, you would not scorn my Letters, if I took so much freedome as to write unto you. I doubt me, Madam, whether it be true that Almerin told me, that you received that which I sent by him, with I know not what kinde of obliging neglect, which made him know you disapprov'd my rash∣ness, but condemn'd it not; that you counterfeit∣ed much anger with me, and him also, who had brought you the news of my Love; but that you
forbare not however to read my Letter, which with a feigned action of disdaign, you opened, and presently gave him back again, without say∣ing ought else to him, than, Go tell thy Master, that his too great boldness does not please me, and bid him call to mind I am the daughter of a King: But Sir, said Almerin, at the recitall which he made of that adventure; Assure your self the fair Orazia loves you, she could not hide from me the least thought of her heart, her eyes reveal'd her most secret purposes, and though they had been shut up too, as was her mouth, I should have found that love was mixed with that blood, which came so often up into her cheeks. The Princess very well remembring, with what innocency that action had passed, when she had counterfeited anger against Almerin, and that, with indeed a feigned anger she had opened that letter, which she had a mind to see, because to say truth she even at that time burnt for love of Anaxauder, she could not chuse but laugh, and blush at once; and the Prince Anaxander being by that natural shamefastness sufficiently assured of the truth thereof, proceeded thus in his dis∣course. You have known all Madam, said he, what∣soever hath since passed in that Court, and that as well, which does concern my love, as that which toucheth Piroxenus melancholy, who would be hardly seen in any company, and cloathed in a long and mourning habit, which yet more his heart put on, did plant a grief and sorrow in the minds of all that saw him. You
saw, how notwithstanding the most strong com∣mands given by the King your father against sin∣gle Combates, whereunto those of this Kingdom more than all I know, are most addicted, and which, but yesterday with so much earnestnesse was reinforced, I slew that proud Lerian, who, through his jealousie of the extraordinary favors I received from the generous Aronthus, chalenged me, who thought, I had diverted from him, those affections he pretended to deserve: and how after that Combate I had enough to do, to save me from the rigor of the Law, if the Prince your brother had not engag'd himself, in my affairs, and urg'd the service I had done him. You have I say, seen all these things Madam, and divers o∣thers, which I cannot but unnecessarily repeat; and therefore mean to tell you only what you do not know. A little before that news came to the King your father, that those two revolted slaves, the perfidious Rozalcan and his brother, not conten∣ted to have made themselves Kings, and absolute Lords of the whole Kingdom of Decan, grown proud in their successes, would yet more advance their Victories, even to assault the King your fa∣thers, power, from whom they newly had usurp'd, and most unjustly taken the Country of Canara, with those three goodly Cities, Onor, Mangalor, and Baticalus, which bordered on their neigh∣bourhood, and lay convenient for them; a little I say, before this ill news arriv'd at Court, we were in a maze to see comming towards us, Ne∣ander, whom we were forc'd to leave by reason
of his wound, in the besieged City, who as∣sured us, that the Princesse Orixa, whom we mourned for, was well alive, and more than ever, beautiful. I will not dwell in telling you, after what fashion sorrowfull Piroxenus did receive this hap∣py news, which at a suddain overcomming him, thought by excesse of that unhop'd for joy to work the same effects upon his heart, that sorrow did; and truly Madam, I apprehended it my self with such contentment, for his sake, that I was like to fall into a Feavor by the extraordina∣ry motion of my spirits. But because we both made shew, to doubt the truth of what he told us so contentfull, though related by a servant of as perfect credit, as fidelity; Neander for our better satisfaction made us a discourse (as I re∣member thus,) of all had past at Visaporus since we left it. Know Sirs, said he, that as soon as they had carryed me into the besieged City, and that I had caused the bodies of the two Princes Araxus, and Demonax, to be carried with me to have them buried (according to the order you gave) in their fathers burying place; Desiring to ac∣quit my self of such other commands as ye had given me, as soon as I was laid in my bed, and that my wound was drest, I sent to entreat the wise Evander, and the Princesse Nurse, to come unto me, to declare them your intentions, which I in person could not execute. Although the old man were exceedingly pleas'd to understand of your safe escape out of
the danger of that sally, which ye undertook, yet was he extremely afflicted that he was enfore'd to lead his life so far off from ye. As for the Nurse, I cannot chuse but wonder that she had not died a thousand times of grief, since first she thought her dear, and beautious Mistresse lost: but when she went into her Chamber to perform towards her, her last offices, with grave Evandes only in her company, she fell to admiration, that when clasping her within her arms, and with her tears bedewing all her face, she found a kinde of respiration, and that she mixt a sigh with hert. Immediately she clap'd her hand upon her heart, where she perceiv'd the warmth was all retir'd, and holding of her arm, she felt her pulse began again to beat. Evander, cry'd she out, in great amazement come and draw neerer, I believe the Princess is not dead, and if I am not deceived in my belief, since your knowledge hath a great ex∣tension, lend her readily your aid. The good old man, at first imagined the Nurse had somewhat lost her understanding, and than her passion for Orixa, made her hink that real which was only strong in her desires, because it was now fourteen hours that she had lain as dead, without either pulse or heat, or motion: But comming neer, he found the same appearances of life, the Nurse had noted; then cast he present∣ly cold water in her face, and made her fumes, and practis'd all the means which in the like extremi∣ties are held requisite, because indeed, the Princess whom they took for dead, was only faln into the last great conflict betwixt Nature, and her grief,
a deadly swouning, which the Greeks  L∣thargy, which as Evander tells us, is only a for∣getfulness, not barely for that, in that miable condition a man forgets every thing, but also that nature forgets her self, and quits her uncti∣ons. The Princess senses then, by Evanders reme∣dies being well come to eesh opened first hr eies, and was agreat while dzled, not knowing whence she came, or where she was, and no of power to speak a word: but when she came to full remembrance, she enquir'd, what was become of Piroxenus, and shortly after she demanded how the state of the bsieged City stood, and how her friends all did; But Evander keeping from her the misfortunes bapned in her hoe: Madam, said he, take courage, for if you pre∣serve your self all will go well, and assure you, Piroxenus florisheth in life, and glory. At two or three daies end, he found a grea amendment in her, and thought it fit not to make known to any body that she was reviv'd, but when she wondred, that the King nor Queen, her brothers, nor your selves had come to visit her, after a number of excuses, and disguisements, E∣vander was at length enfore'd to ell her even the naked truth, of that lamentable History, in which she found yet cause of comforting her self, for that her husband liv'd, and that her self remained only heir unto the Kingdom of Decan, the gods undoubtedly would guard her, since they had had such a particular care of her life, untillthat time.
I will not repeat you the complaints she made; unfeignedly, they were extreme, and if any thing oblig'd her to out-live her Parents, and without desperation to endure their losse, it was the com∣fort only they had given her, in assurance, that her Husband liv'd in his escape; who taking it for granted she was dead, as all we did, he had resolv'd to follow her, but that his friend had hindred him, and by constraint enforced him to live for love of him; though, in such case, as by affliction he was cast into, death had been sweeter to him far than life; and that no longer able to endure that City, which had heap'd so many miseries upon him, he undertook that sally which succeeded to them, and had been so fatal to the brother Princes, who could not with more glory have expir'd. At length, Madam, said Evander to her, where ever Piroxenus be, I can assure you he is living, if a continual tract of torments may be called life, and even as soon as Neanders would is whole, he shall go tell him how you do, and well I know, those Princes will use all their power to settle you again with∣in your fathers, Throne. Meanwhile, I pray, have patience, Madam, and take comfort from the gods: but because all the world thinks you are dead, and that the noise thereof is spread into the enemies Camp; I think tis best to let it run so still, and even that all the inhabitants of Visa∣porus may believe it likewise, that when the ene∣mies shall become Masters of the City, which in a day or two will be, when I have capitulated with them, they may not satisfie their cruelty on
you, who would undoubtedly aswage their ty∣ranny. Meanwhilke you should conceal your self, and taking on you another name, and parentage, should passe as a kinswoman to your Nurse, who shall take you into her house which she hath in the City, where we desire we may to morrow, conveigh you secretly, The Princess who expected aid and Comfort no where else except from us, did all she could to pacifie her sorrow in obedience to the Counsel we had given her, and, when she was in place of safety, Evander call'd the chiefest of the City to my Lodging, who being battered with their losses and misfortunes, were of our opinion, that it was expedient, they should send to tell the two usurpers, that the Magistrates were ready to give up themselves unto them, as their Lords, and Matters, on condition they should use them fa∣vourably. Rozalcon, and Zabain, whose great fury died with those, whose lawfull possession of the Crown stood as an obstacle to their ambitious desires, received acceptably such just terms as we propos'd to them, and having granted all we ask'd, we opend them the gates. As soon as they had taken possession of the Royal Palace, and strong places, they sent their Army, being well paid, into small Towns, and Cities, bordering about them, into Garrison: and took the dead King Demonax his Nares under their command, and us'd the inhabitants of that unhappy City, as their Subjects, not their enemies. As for my part, they offred me very good conditions, if I
would have served them, and having learnt who Evander was, they gave him goodly presents, for Alcidais King of Cambayes sake, to whom he did belong, and whose good will they passionate∣ly desir∣d, and sent him to his Master. He took his leave of me with tears in his eyes, and gaveme a great charge of you at parting: Haste thee Neander, said he, to be well, and go finde out our Masters, with as much good speed as may be, and tell them from me, they no longer please themselves to go unknown; for I foresee more miseries do threaten them, under the names of Ariomant and Calistenus, and bid them not forget the hazards they have run, whiles they were known as Taxilus and Cleontus. As for me, said the good old man, as soon as I have receiv'd the Princesse commands, I purpose to make all the haste my age will give me leave, to carry news of them unto their parents, if so the gods allow me strength enough to do my journey. Orixa meanwhile, under the name of Asteria, which she had taken on her, lived in private man∣ner, in her Nurses house, and hopefull that she should again behold her husband, and recover by his courage, and his might, what was usurped from her, once her fathers just possession, she by some and some, forgat her past misfortunes, and resolved to think upon her self again. As for my self (Sirs) because I had a bone which was exceedingly hurt, I was almost three months in cure, during which time the feign'd Asteria had recovered all her beauty, and strength, and having understood (which we were glad
for,) that Rozalcan, and Zabain, making ill use of their prosperity, were gone to Conquer the Country of Canara, under the King of Narsinga; Cheer up Neander, said the Princess to me, the gods undoubtedly are weary of mhing, more those Tyrants, seeing their arogance hath carri∣ed them to set upon the mightiest Monarch of the Indes, who wellknows how to pay their rashness; and seeing thy Master, and his dear friend are at present with that King, whose rage our enemies have now provoked; Go, go with speed, Neander, to them, tell them I am yer alive, and that amidst a thousand crosses, and misfor∣tunes, the gods have kept me to delight my faith∣ful husband, from whom, for my past negli∣gences, I crave humble pardon; tell them, they hasten to my succour, and use all their power with the King of Narsinga, whom the gods for punishment of our common Usurpers, have in∣terrested to revengeme. I have told you now whatever hath fallen out in Vsaporus since your leaving it, which I have us'd much diligence to come and do. Surely, Madam, this relation of Neanders did so mollifie Piroxenus heart, that at one time he shed both tears of joy, and of compassion; from that instant, he consider'd nothing, but which way to re-establish the deposed Princess, and re∣venge her wrongs upon her enemis; and Ma∣dam, as you know there fell ou happily a means, for but a little ere Neanders arrivall, intelligence was brought the King your Father, how that perfidious Rozalcan, and his brother, had by
force taken Onor, Mangalos, and Baticalus, three of the chiefest Cities of Canara; and was repor∣ted, that they purposed a farther Conquest, and at your losse to augment yet more their own pos∣sessions; which so incens'd the King, and ani∣mated so exceedingly the poor Aronthus to re∣venge, as he had need of no more spurs, than from his own resentments: However Piroxenus and I, feigning at first, that we were not therein concern'd, compassed to kindle such a fire with∣in his heart, boiling already with high rage, that whatsoever termes the two Usurpers offred him, could never work their peace, though nere so much to his advantage; then did he gladly re∣ceive the offers which we made him of our per∣sons to attend him in that War. But, for it was so easie a matter, to regain the Country of Canara, where the Enemy had sent bu a part of their Army, and kept the other with them neer about Visaporus, we perswaded the Prince, that there was much more honor to be gotten, to go and take those two Monsters, whiles Lisimantus, whose courage, and conduct the King of Zeylan hd tried, and whom he had sent to the King our Father to assist him in those stirs, should go and lay his siege, to those three Cities newly taken from him. This Counsell was accepted by Aronthus, who put it presently in execution. Lisimantus was sent into the Countrey of Canara, and had the honour to divide the leading of the Army with the Prince your Brother, who led on his Troops, in great journeys towards Visaporus, where abode
our common enemies; During our March, the love he bare us was augmented by one half, in so much, as on a day being in discourse of sundry matters, he fell I know not how on our adven∣turs, which he had somewhat heard of, and ask'd us, if we knew not what was become of the two Princes of Cambaye and Cytor, who had of late been in danger to lose their lives in Visa∣porus, disguising their names with Taxilus, and Gleontus, and whether indeed, they died not there, with the two Princes of Decan. He knew of that Sally, where he believed we had all come short, he likewise did believe Orixaes death, which hee had heard from common noise, and was not ig∣norant, how that was the strongest consideration, which had made us sally with such fury on our enemies, and leave the beleaguered Town, which was so many ways most horrible to Piroxenus; but had not since that time heard speak of us; and finding that he was inclinable to take us for those same, for whom he did enquire, against the opi∣nion that sundry others were of who had possest him of our deaths, we thought, that we should in∣jure him, if longer we did hide our selves. And therefore, Madam, we freely told him who wee were, together as I have done you, the first occasi∣on of our journey, and all that hapned since our leaving Gouzarate, unto the entertainment of my love which I had made you. We told him more∣over, that the fair Orixa was still living, and how we had understood it. I will not busie my self to tell you of the joy he did conceive, and the excuses which he made us, and his dear imbra
of us: It is sufficient, Madam, that you have known the goodnss of his nature, to imagine he omitted nothing, which civility, and honour, might enable him to our advantage; hee vowed to me, that although the King my Father disin∣herited me, which he could ot but unjustly do, you should as soon be mine, as if I had the world in my possession, and that at worst, Narsinga we should share betwixt us. He witnessed no less de∣sire to favour Piroxenus his pretensions, and swore he would restore his spouse unto her Fathers Throne, or die in that behalf. Alas, Madam, unwittingly he by those words did prophesie his own misfortune; for as you know he perish'd in that glorious design, which with his life he did accomplish. He had in short space, put all those Cities of Decan, which were neer to Visaporus, under the King your Fathers subjection; and having known that the enemy kept the field, and that they dar'd not to immure themselves, he resolv'd to give them Battell, where we observed such acts of his, as are not equalled by any History: among other exploits worthy of memory, he killed Zabain with his own hand, and had from Rozalcan, his mortall wound, which quickly after we reven∣ged; for when I saw him hurt, who never parted one step from him, I rush'd with fury on the guard about our enemy, and seconded by the in∣censed courage of Piroxenus, I found no Arms defenceable againstmy hewing blade; I in one instant overthrew that rabble rout, and took their leader Prisoner: in short, we won the Battell,
whose whole glory does belong unto the gene∣rous Aronthus; we had him carried, sorely hurt, into his Tent, but when we knew his wounds were mortall, and that he had not above two houres more to live, we bare with more impati∣ence far, the loss of him, than we had done the victory, if we had lost it. At this cruell remembrance, Anaxanders eye grew full of tears, and were soon, by the Prin∣cess, seconded, she loved so dearly that same Brother, as the the sorrow she conceived for his death, surmounted far the secret joy which she might take at her inheritance: shee had so excel∣lent a nature, and was so full of true and emi∣nent vertues, as that her reall sorrow kept her from any sense of Glory, for her future elevation to Narsinga's Regall Throne, which would have shaken any mind, and reason save her own, and overthrown undoubtedly whatever heart had not been well compos'd. I must make an end, Madam, continued the Prince Anaxander, though not without renew∣ing, both as well my own, as your displeasures: The poor Aronthus seeing we despaired of his life, did all he could to make us willing of his death; and his great courage prompted him to utter, though in dying, a number of exceeding brave things, which by his people were taken for as many marks of his admired generosity; He charg'd them all to give obedience to Piroxenus, and my self, to finish what had been so well be∣gun, and that without declaring to them who we were, because we had entreated him he
would not; He only told them, they should fol∣low us to Visaporus, which he believed could not hold out long against us, seeing the Rebels chief were overthrown, and all their purpo∣ses destroy∣ed by the Battels loss. When he at large had uttered his full intenti∣ons, he worthily rewarded all his servants, and gave fair gifts to those who had well serv'd him in that war; and having with all fervency, and zeal, commended his soul unto the Gods, not willing to trust his Secretary, he called one of his Squires, even him, who two dayes since, I followed, where I had the honour of access unto you, Madam, and bid him get him Pen, and Ink, for that hee found himself yet strong enough to leave his last Will for his dear Sister under his own hand: before he had made an end of it, fee∣ling his heart to fail him, he charged Saradyn his Squire, who is now yours, to seal it with his Seal, and give it to no hand but yours; death came so fast upon him, as he was constrain'd to leave it imperfect, but he had so much reason, as to see it Sealed in his presence ere he died, I be∣lieve, Madam, by that I have collected from your words since my return, his care did only tend to give you knowledge of our births, and that to mitigate your sorrow for his death, he would be first, should tell you of his quality, whose heart was vowed to you, and whose services you had not scorn'd. Then Orazia drew the Letter from her Pocket, whereupon they wept again; and after Anaxander had wip'd off his tears, he thus went on to end his Story.
Madam, said he, as soon as brave Aronthus soul had taken flight among the Gods, we caus'd his body to be pretiously embalm'd, which though so inanimate, wee accounted worthy of a Tri∣umph, if so the King thought good to grant that honour to his memory, which could not be suf∣ficiently perform'd towards so great a Prince; we therefore sent a Post unto the King your Father, to advertise him, of what misfortune had befaln his only Son, and that with common consent all the Army meant as soon as Visaporus should bee taken, to conduct the Corps to Baticalus, where we had understood the King, with all his Court, was gone, since Lisimantus by his valour had re∣gain'd it from the enemy, and that we meant, if he so pleased, to accompany the pomp of his Fu∣nerals, with that of his Triumph, which he ap∣proved of. Some few dayes after, Saradin departed with the dead Princes Letter; and we, Madam, drew right to Visaporus, which was not three Leagues distant from us: but first we summon'd them to yeeld themselves, as we did also, unto those of Goa, Ballagate, Chaul, Bider, and Danaget, which were the Capitall Cities of Decan, and which we would reduce under obedience to Orixa, there was not one that made so much as shew of hol∣ding out against us; but having lost their lawfull Lords, and of themselves not able to maintain themselves, they voluntarily submitted to the King your Father, whose Authority they hop'd was much more pleasing, and more honourable, than the rule of two revolved slaves, which only
force, had made them subject to. Madam, I fear to hold you over long, if I should punctually relate you all that hapned us in Visa∣porus, where soon the Gates were opened to us, and, if I should tell you all the joy, and pleasures Piroxenus felt, when he saw, his dear and saith∣full. Orixa in a private house, where she, unknown to any other save her Nurse, had liv'd under the name of Asteria: know only, Madam, that there never was so great equality of transports, or re∣ciprocall embracements, as they two exchang'd, where I forbare not too, to take my part, as by the duty of my friendship I was bound, without impediment to theirs. Piroxenus began presently to talk of re-esta∣blishing his Spouse, without expecting the King your fathers approbation, with whose Forces on∣ly we had compass'd our designes; but seeing that the heat of his passion moved him so for∣ward, I restrain'd him; and far was that advised Princess, to whom we had already told all our adventures, and pretensions, from pressing us thereto: she would not give consent to be so much as known alive, till we were known unto the King. I mean, said she, to passe still for Aste∣ria, whiles my faithful husband goes for Caliste∣nus, and that Anaxander wears the name of Ari∣omant: the gods forbid, that ever I delight to reign alone, or that I reckon the Decanians my Subjects till Piroxenus do receive the Oath of their Alegiance. Go then, said she, present your selves unto the King of Narsinga, like Princes as your are, and you, my faithfull husband, do
your best, that solemnly our Marriage may again be shortly witnessed, when Anaxanders, and O∣razias Weddings are solemnized. We did as she commanded, Madam, and lea∣ving her in a mean quality as she desir'd, when we had left as Governor an old servant of Aron∣thus in the Castle of Visaporus, we took our leaves of her, and went to fetch the body where we left it, which in the pomp you saw, we followed to this City. There Anaxander finished his History, and his dear Orazia who for Orixas satisfaction, as her own, died almost, in her longing desire that they should shew themselves unto the King for such as really they were, pray'd them to be there again next evening, to resolve, how to contrive a mat∣ter of so great importance: Meanwhile, without more stay, our faithfull Lovers interchang'd their Marriage faith, which they confirm'd with mu∣tuall kisses in the presence both of Piroxenus and of Lifimena too. And being late, they were com∣pell'd to part untill next night, although their hearts and inds were not at all divided.
THE INDIAN HISTORY OF AN AXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The fourth BOOK. HAd the Princess been able to fore∣see the mischief which by Lisi∣mantus Page (the little Aqui∣lant,) his treason was ordain'd them, they would not have per∣mitted his so free accesses to the Garden with them as they did. I have already said, he was a spie for Lisimantus, who had gained him by flat∣tery, and gifts, and having seen through certain rails, the two Princes enter at a secret door into the Arbor, without understanding either their
discourse, or complements, imagining they had as much to say to Lisimena, as to her companion Orazia, he faild not on next morning early to ad∣vertise Lisimantus of it. The Cavallier was yet in bed, where, notwith∣standing, his amorous thoughts had not allowd him any rest, when that unfaithful Messenger came to disturb his mind, more cruelly by that unhappy news, than it had ever been. Immedi∣ately, as tis the common custom of men in love, to think that only their Mistresses are look'd up∣on, so great a power hath jealousie over the highest spirits, he made himself believe that Ari∣omant (for he knew not Anaxander but under that borrowed name) was lov'd of Lisimena; and since that a great courage endureth nothing more impatiently than scorn, seeing another was ad∣mitted to his prejudice in private, and imagining, that that was the sole obstaele that hindred him from being lov'd of Lisimena, he resolves him instantly to take revenge of both, and to comprize as well Orazia as an accessary unto that Trea∣son, which they us'd towards him in that com∣mon losse. But his generousness not suffering his choler in such sort to blinde him, or to be led unto so base a revenge, after a tedious consultation with himself, at length, his anger wholly bent to Anaxander, and although himself had but three daies before, assisted to renew that bloody edict against Duels, not able resolve to expell his ima∣ginary enemy, but by honorable waies, without more ado, because his jealous fury would admit
of no delay, he purposed to watch him, from that very evening when he should return unto his a∣morous appointment, that he might assign an o∣ther, and provoke him to sight with him. He had understood from Aquilant by what way he had accustomed to enter the Garden of Foun∣tains, and because he had also learnt that he came alwaies accompanied with his friend, without farther enquiry, and dissembling what he thought, before Aquilant, he went to one Zenobus, whom he had made Governor of Baticalus, and of whose courage he had great assurance, having seen in severall occasions his performance, and drawing him aside, discours'd thus to him. Brave Zenobus, thou knowest the love I bear thee, and after what manner I have ever trusted my important secrets to thy judgement, and cou∣rage: wherefore, I intend no longer preamble to tell thee that I need thy sword to aid me, in the demanding of reason for an affront I have re∣ceiv'd; It troubles me to take thee from that place so soon, so proper for thee, and which thou oughtest longer to enjoy, because, undoubtedly the rigor of the late Edict, will force thy ab∣sence; But I would swear, (so well am I assored of thy bravery,) that better fortunes could not hinder thee from running hazards with me. A man that had not been very generous, would have been much amaz'd at this discourse, for one of these he must resolve, either to quit the Land, or else expose himself to an exemplary punish∣ment to appease the Kings anger: But Zenobus, whose hears was good, and who besides his ob∣ligations
to Lisimantus, found himself engagd to serve him for his honor sake, answer'd him freely, that he held it for great honor, that he would elect him for that occasion; how that it was one of the greatest proofs he ever had receiv'd of his esteem, and friendship, and that he should not so much as mention the Government of Ba∣ticalus, for that he never did account thereof, but as he had received it of him, and that he should gain more by following him than by a constant residence in one place, where he, after could not be eye-witnesse of his fair exploits. Lisimantus very much pleased at that freedom, nam'd him the man, with whom he was to do, and having a neer guess at Anaxander, and Piroxenus his swords, they fitted two of equall length. But Zenobus who was not so blinded with passion as Lisimantus, whiles the hour that should be favor∣able to his friends revenge approached, had the care to make provision for his surety, and his own: and forasmuch as they had purposed to fight by the light of the Moon, upon the Sea shore, he caused a Bark to be ready to transport them into Zeylan, a sure sanctuary for them, when they should have slain their enemies, over whom they hoped for a suddain victory. Li∣simantus approv'd of that design, because, if after that Duel, he should fall into the King of Narsin∣ga his hands, a most severe observer, and beyond imagination, of his Edicts, he must run a great hazard (although a stranger as he was,) to serve, as an example, and his services done the Crown might not (it may be) have assured him. The
heat of the day was over, and night by its sweet humidity, began to invite all the world to rest, except our Lovers, whom for severall respects it doubly disquieted: For Anaxander who on the one side came accompanied with his friend, to bid fare well unto his Princess, seared to be too late at his amorous randezvous, and on the other side Lisimantus feared his too late arrival; whose impatience scarce permitted any longer to defer his taking revenge. He kept himself concealed in a by corner of the street, every minute complaining to his faith-full Zenobus, that his adversary was too long a comming, when he spied him appear with his dear Piroxenus walking a little before, going as twere the round, surveighing every quarter there∣about, to see if he could discover any body. Li∣simantus, and his second, instantly retired them∣selves, to give them leave to come neerer the Prin∣cesses Garden door, which stood betwixt shut, and open, to receive them: And when they were neer enough, stay Ariomant, cry'd Lisimantus, who therewithall stept forth, stay thou persidi∣ous man, thou hast too long enjoy'd a happinesse which I have better than thy self deserved, and is refused me, by ungratefull Fortune; I have prepar'd thee other Cates, than those thou goest to, in the Garden: let us but draw aside a little, that we may not be interrupted, and I shall tell thee my resentments. Anaxander who distrusted nothing, was much astonished to see himself discovered; and belie∣ved, that treason had been contrived for him, by
some one of the Princesses domestiques, but when by the brightnesse of the Moon, which was by this time well advanced he discovered Lisiman∣tus, he was more than formerly, surpriz'd; for he knew he was in love with Lisimena, and thought his jealousie deceived him, however, finding himself offended at the injurious words, which inconsiderately he spake, that he had grea∣ter merit than himself, instead of more courte∣ous saluting him, which undoubtedly he had done, if he had come with mildnesse to him: Lisimantus said he to him, had not thy choler too much at first transported thee, I would have plaint¦ly shewn thee thy mistake: but seeing thy pre∣sumption renders thee unworthy of excuse, I mean to shew the presently, that in ill time thou hast delighted to offend a man, of greater justice than thy self. Lets talk no more, reply'd Lis∣mantus, and that as sew may see us as we can, lets fight upon the strand which is not above two hundred paces hence, thou hast no reason to defer it till another time, because the Moon is bright, and I have brought a man to entertain your friend. Lets go said Anaxander, I am not so good at words, as actions. Meanwhile that this was doing, the Princesses who heard confusedly the murmure of their voices, though ignorant of the cause, for fear of scandal, shut the door which was but little open: and when they found, that Anaxander came not, they imagined a part of the misfortune which had hapned, and thought that some one had watched the two Princes, and pricked onward
with some just sense, had sought for reason, and that undoubtedly, that was the cause from which the noise they heard, proceeded. Immediately the fair Orazia caus'd Saradin to be call'd to her, and with her eyes, laden with tears, conjured him to run to Anaxanders lodg∣ing, and that if there he found him not, he should seek every where, and try if he could discover no body on the strand, because she was assiu'd she heard some quarel at the Garden door. Sara∣din made all the haste he could to finde our com∣batants, but he had too late notice of it; for the businesse was dispatched ere he found them, whose deplorable conclusion, fill'd him with com∣passion and confusion; and had much more wrought upon his heart, if he had known but Li∣simantus his story. But because there was never seen, so furious a Combate sought, as between those four, it will not be impertinent, to give you the description in a few words. As soon as they were come, where Lisimantus had a mind to lead them on the strand, having cast off their Dublets, & unsheath'd their swords, and that their seconds had seperated themselves about an hundred paces from them, that they might not hinder them, they witness'd all bus one resentment, and who had seen them could not have discern'd the seconds from the Princi∣pals, so eqaully were they incensed to revenge. Anaxander, and Lisimantus, began first, whiles their friends were going off, and made an infinite number of thrusts in the beginning, to see if they could dazle one the other, or set each other out
of guard: but being guided by an equal cou∣rage to assault, and seconded by as much dexe∣rity to ward the blows, they fought a quarter of an hour without being able mortally to hurt each other; they passed twenty times with e∣qual nimblenesse on one another, because they had agreed not to close; and seeing that they could not that way compasse their intents, they us'd a thousand faints, and all the subtilties of Fencing, to undo their lives, so cruelly were they bent to one another: Their blows were so thick, that notwithstanding all their cunning in de∣sence, they could not avoid an infinite number of hurts: so as at every step they made, the earth was stained with their blood, and who had seen their all-discoloured faces, would have said they had already lost a great abundance: but because they both had mighty hearts, they felt not weaknesse, but through the greatnesse of their courage, seeble as they were, they yet subsisted. On the other side, Piroxenus having to do with a valiant enemy, had a hard task to overcome him; at first they made five or six thrusts at one another, without hurt, and Zouobus trusting in his exceeding force, the second passe let fall his sword, to close, and grasp Piroxenus, whom he constrain'd to quit his likewise, that he might the better struggle with him: They long disputed after this manner, at length they came to ground, and Piroxenus no lesse strong than dexterous, had the good hap to fall upon his enemy, whom he might have strangled if he would, for that the fall was very soul. Zenobus finding himself in so ill
case; Sir Knight, cryed he out, if we end not our Combate after another manner than this, it will not be in haste that we shall help our friends; it was not I that began said Piroxenus, thou wouldst fain prevail by thy might, and the gods have ordered that thy subtilty hath served to thy prejudice: However, though thou art already o∣vercome, to let thee know I can tell how to con∣quer every way, I give thee leave to take thy sword again, to defend thy self against mine, which is able to lay thee once more levill with the ground: and therewithall he rose and re∣turned toward Zenobus with his sword in his hand, who being much broken by the greatness of his fall, fought not again with so much nim∣blenesse as formerly, although his courage were continually the same, he was therefore fain to recoil at those gallant onsets Piroxenues gave him at the first, and in retiring had the ill fortune to light upon a stone, over which he fell backward, when instantly Piroxenus lept upon him, and ha∣ving made him yield his sword, he ran withall his might to succour Anaxander, whom he found fallen on one side, not able any longer to help himself, for the losse of blood which ran every where, out of his wounds, and Lisimantus on the other in the same condition. They both yet breathed, when Piroxenus came neer them, but with very little sign of life. By and by, without staying to bemoan his friend, who had more need of ready help, than uselesse tears, he drew out of his pocket a precious Balme, with which he presently anointed all his wounds and
toar his shirt in divers places to bin them up a well as he could. But as soon as he gave them air, he perceived him by little and little to vanish in his arms, turning sweetly his eyes towards him, without being able to speak one word. Poor Piroxenus believing that his friend was dead, who was but in a swound, felt in his own heart deadly touches; and moreover fearing lest some Officer of justice might surpriz: the body in that unhappy state, and exercise the rigor of the new Edict on him, as an example, was in a grie∣vous straight, and a thousand times tempted to despair, and open with his own hand a way through which he might follow his dear Anax∣ander. Zenobus having on another side, found his friend weak, and at the point of death, ran hasti∣ly towards the bark which he had caused to be ready neer the shore, not far from the Haven, and brought the Chirurgion which he had provided there, with the three Saylers, and having found that Lisimantus had yet some small motion of his pulse, they carried him upon a Coverlet into the Vessel, that they might preserve at least his body, and immediately hoyst sail, to leave the Coasts of Zeylan. Scarce were they unmoared, when Saradin arriv'd, with Almerin, and Nean∣der the faithful servants of our two Princes, be∣cause for satisfaction of what the Princesse had told him, he had run first to Anaxanders lodg∣ings, and not finding him there, knowing how great considence his Cousin and himself had of Almerin, and Neander, had lead them with him,
that he might not fail of what he went about, which had been hard for him to do alone. But O ye gods, how sad and woful spectacle at once beheld they: At first they found one of their Ma∣sters stretched out in his blood upon the sands, having nor heat nor motion, and then the other desperate, weeping, and cursing heaven, that had preserv'd his life: none of them knew in that extremity what to resolve; for if on the one side, they lamented for Anaxanders death, they fear∣ed on the other left two or three fishermen who had seen the Combate might reveal it, and not daring to carry back the body into the Town, they neither of them knew what place of surety to dispose it in. In this confusion Saradin was dispatched, in behalf of them all, toward the Princesse, to advertise her of this accident, that she on her side might try to remedy it, and pre∣vent that he whom she had chosen for her hus∣band might not again be unfortunate after his death. The poor Orazia in the deadly apprehension of that disafter, which she had foreseen, had caus∣ed all her women to retire, and shut her self into her Chamber to entertain her melancholy alone; when Saradin, in truth a little too inconsiderate∣ly, in searful manner brought her the woful news of her Lovers death. The word wounded her heart, as soon as her ear, and as a sharp dart, peirced it on every side; she strove to resist the unhappiness which sur∣prized her; but she was taken at an instant, in so much, as staggering in Saradins arms who held
her up, he was at length constrain'd to let her fall upon the Velvet floar clean lost; he was rea∣dy to call her women to her aid, but, consider∣ing the accident requir'd but sew witnesses, and finding in her Closet, some cold water, he cast thereof upon her face, and caused her eyes to half open: Madam, cryed he suddenly to her, come to your self, despair not before time, hap∣pily Anaxander may not be dead: and that which makes me think he is not, is because you were your self even now, just in his plight, and I perceive you breath again; then presently he un∣laced her bodies, and when she had more liberty, she opened broad her eyes, which suddainly were drowned in a multitude of tears: and when she would have unclos'd her mouth, to have second∣ed the with her complaints, and griefs, she could not uster more than two or three sight, which she drow from the bottom of her heart, and were as many witnesses of her most deadly sor∣row. Saradin conceived by that action that she was not yet perfectly come to her self, and though her fair eyes were exceedingly troubled, he saw as clearly as in her heart, the second seebleness that threatned her, and cast water again upon her face and wrung her hands, and cryed in her car, and us'd such means, as that at length, he got her perfectly out of her swoundings. When she was ready to begin her complaints, one of her women took the boldnesse to enter her Chamber, to give notice, that a Gentleman desiring to speak with Saradin, about matters of great importance, expected him at the door. Sa∣radin
imagining it to be one of those whom he had left with Anaxander went forth with leave of the Princesse, and found it to be Almerin, who was come hastily to tell them that his Mastet li∣ved yet, and that some order or other must be speedily taken to perserve him, for that there ran already through the City a whisper of that Duel; Saradin intreated his patience a little, and ran into the Closet, to repair the evill, which his first intelligence had caused; The Princesse, commanded that Almerin should he let enter, who recounted to her his Masters adventure, whom they had lamented dead, how God be praised he was come again to himself, how they had brought him out of the way, and upon their cloaks carried him unto a green bed, where he was much better than upon the strand: but where the moistnesse of the night might however do him great harm, in case he were not suddainly succoured. Hereof they all three consulted, and Saradin having proposed to have him conveighed unto a Castle which he had some ten leagues off, upon the road to Bisnagar, the Princess held it fit, without considering, in the trouble she was in, as well as the rest, that that Castle, was the first lodging the King meant to take, who within two daies intended to depart from Bacicalus to return for Bisnagar; and having made choice of a very excellent Chirurgion, and the Princess furnishe the Litter, they went to take Anaxander, and together with Piroxonus, and Neander, con∣vaighed him all the night as far as the Castle, where Saradin at first conceal'd him in a Cham∣ber
very private, for fear the King in passing might discover him. As soon as he had sitted him with what was necessary, he left him in the company of his dear Piroxenus, and his two Gentlemen, and return∣ed upon the gallop, to Baticalus, which was al∣ready full of that Duel. And to prevent a search, the Princesse thought good to spread a noise, that Anaxander was slain, for that Lisimantus was seen fly, and that the fishermen who had re∣ported it, had seen Anaxander stretched out in his own blood, without any appearance of life, la∣mented of his people, and be wailed of his friends, which gave an easie credit of his death. It was the absence only of those valiant Cavalliers, and of their friends, which gave suspicion they had fought: for not withstanding the noise of their Duel, which had run through the City, had they returned safe, there being no man to accuse them, they had run no hazard, nor fallen into any kinds of trouble. But, when the King found them all four away, and that he knew, that those from whom he ex∣pected greatest supports, in the maintainance of his Edict, had been the first infringers: he ra∣ged, and swearing deeply, that he would be re∣venged even upon the dead, commanded, that A∣riomants body should be sought for, to expose it, to the shame of punishment. I perceive said he, my authority is very openly scorned, and I were very worthy to be laughed at by my neigh∣bours, if I endured the violation of an Edict, made but three daies since, for whose execution
I have so solemnly sworn upon the Altars. I vow again, even by my Fathers Soul, that Lisi∣mantus, though a stranger as he is, shall repent him of it, and, that he shall not so close keep him∣self in Zeylan, but I will one day sinde him our to be revenged on him: As for Ariomant, who hath been as it were naturaliz'd among us, and who hath lived under my pay, I will, that he en∣dure our justice, and that his body, dead as it is, be dismembred by the ministers of justice; and I proclaim him, an enemy to my State, and Crown, whoever shall conceal, or assist to the close keeping of Galistenus: in continuance of this protestation, he promised the Government (which Zenobus had) of Baticalus, to whomsoe∣ver should bring him any one of those four, ei∣ther alive, or dead; immediately every man sets himself upon the quest: but there was too faith-full a care had of Anaxanders surety, whose wounds however great, being found not deadly, Piroxenus, and he, made but sport of that adven∣ture; they promised themselves, to spend the time merrily one day with the King of Narsinga, when they should return to Gonzarat in Princes equipage, having sent their Embassadors before them. In the mean while, for fear lest the noise of that Duel, and the pretended death of Anaxan∣der, spread through all parts, might not cause O∣rixa, whom they had left unknown in Visaporus, to suspect some disaster, they dispatched Nean∣der toward her, for her satisfaction, and to tell her, the cause of their delay, assuring her, that as
soon as Anaxander should be recovered, they would travel for Gouzarat, and return with all expedition, in the quality they had promised her, taking with them only faithful Almerin, to serve them, as occasion offered it self. On the other side, the King causing so exact a search to be made for Ariomant, sent every mo∣ment to Oyazias soul, most deadly fears, who doubting that her Ariomant was not enough con∣ceal'd, was a thousand times tempted to disco∣ver his name, and birth unto her Father, for at voiding such inconveniencies as might happen: she was thereto more pressed, by the perswasions of Lisimena, who seeing the Kings rage each hour increase, for want of news, was of opinion, that by telling him the true extraction of those two Princes, (it was best to hold him no longer in er∣rour) who were not Subject to his jurisdiction, nor the observation of his Laws: But whatever great appearances obliged her to this discovery, Orazia feared to be worse than that word she had given the two Princes, not to make them known, untill they were returned to Gouzarat, and therefore she entreated Lisimena to continue the secret, and not reveal it till the time were come. So our two Heroes remain'd conceal'd in Sa∣radins Castle, untill Anaxander were recovered, and being both assured of their mistresse savours, burnt with one equal impatience of returning to their own Provinces, where they expected ear∣nestly, that the good Evander (who should have been long since returned) should have regained
for them, Alcidaris good will; but this sage old man was taken, and held sick, some six, or seven daies journey from Visaporus, which hindred the performance of his commission, so soon as he ought, and that he could not come time enough, to divert an Embassage, which tended to the ruin of Anezanders contentment, as you shall under∣stand by what does follow. Alcidaris the great, had by the common noise, learnt all that had befaln his son Anaxander, and his nephew Piroxenus, in the Kingdom of De∣can, which gave him wonderful discontentments: And because in that great sally, they had made, where the two Princes, Araxus, and Demonax were slain upon the place, some of those, who sled from the confusion (as well as they themselves) had spread the news of their deaths, as in truth, sew men knew what was become of them; the King of Cambaya believing them out of the world, notwithstanding all their youthful parts, and follies past, was hardly able to be comfor∣ted: especially, when he reflected on their amia∣ble presence, and the good education which they had gotten in his house, and that which ad∣ded to his affliction, was to see, that that child, which remained to him by his former wife, was so unhappy born, as not be acceptable to one sub∣ject he had; the most complacent, and foulest flatteners of his Court, wanted boldnesse to ap∣plaud his ridiculous actions, or commend him, be never did any thing but out of season, if he had a mind to oblige, he did the contrary, and dul∣nesse was as natural, as vice unto him: however,
this unhappy father, who believed that he had no other child alive, finding himself obliged to marry him, not, for any good inclinations he had for him, but for the proper interest of his greatnesse, and to perperuate his name, and me∣mory, having known of the death of Arontus sole son unto the King of Narsinga, who had remai∣ning, but one only daughter, heir to all his Estates, thought good, together with his Coun∣sell, to seek her in Marriage for his son: for this purpose he dispatched Pirobus (who had wor∣thily served him in divers other occasions) in an Embassage towards the King of Narsing a, as well to condole with him, the losse of his son, as to desire his daughter; of which, the young Alcida∣ris had no sooner understood, but he burst out a weeping as if he had lost all his friends. For he had fallen in love with a mean towns-mans daughter, whom by all means he would marry, and for her sake despised the love of the greatest Ladies, and the rarest beauties of the Court. This faithful Pirobus, whose age, and abilities made him very venerable, soon after departed from Campanel, and having learned on the way, shat the King, to whom he was sent, remained yet at Baticalus, made so good journeys, as he ar∣rived there, the very next day after that Duel had been fought. The King received him magnificently; and dis∣sembling the displeasure he took at that so late fought Combate, he resolved to give him Audi∣ence, before he would depart for Bisnagar, that the grave oid man might have lesse labour, and
journey to return. He knew not the cvill con¦ditions of the Prince of Gouzarat, nor any thing but of the greatness of his race, and his possessi∣ons, for that indeed, there was not in all India a more mighty Monarch than the King his father; He stood not long deliberating, whether or not, he should satisfie Pirobus, and prefer the alliance offered by him, before all other that might be hereafter. And a speciall motive which so much rather made him give him his desire, was, the as∣surance given in the King his Masters behalf, that be had but that child only hopeful to inherit four Kingdoms: And thus you see, how the King of Narsinga sent back Pirobus, with great em∣braces, and fair presents, and fully pleased every way with his so happy imployment. Before he departed, he was by the Kings leave to kisse the hand of his future Princess, who ha∣ving nothing dearer in the world, than that name of Cambaye, to whose lovely Prince, she had al∣ready vowed her self, receiv'd him with a smiling countenance, and dessembling the knowledge of his evill parts, for whom he sought her, said to Pirobus, that the gods had favored her too much, that had design'd her for the most perfect and ac∣complished Prince of Gouzarat She was even on the point of opening her self wholly to the grave Embassadour; because she knew he was the man that had treated the match for Anax∣anders mother, and that she happily might do him an exceeding favour, to declare him his ad∣ventures, and to tell him where, with Piroxenus he was concealed, for having been one of that
Combat which he heard so much noise of in Ba∣ticalus: but she thought best to say nothing, for fear of disobliging Anaxander, who would not be known in Narsing a but with a Royal train, and worthy of the love he made to Orazia. However, because she had a perfect knowledge of her Lovers story, and because she had learnt it from his own mouth, that after the taking of Visaporus, the good Evander his old Governor returned to Gouzarat, where he was to declare unto Alcidaris, the adventures of his son, and nephew, she very much wondred that Pirobus as∣sured the King her father and her self likewise, that the Prince in whose behalf he was sent, was the only son of his Master; among other questi∣one which she made him of the Kingdom of Cambaya, she askt him what was become of the wise Evander, of whose abilities, she had heard so much discourse. Madam answered the Em∣bassador, we know not what fortune he hath run since he stole from our Court to pursue the two Prince, whose losse we have felt so sensibly, as we shall never come again to our selves: and for mine own part, Madam, I should be the unthank∣follest man alive, if I did not weep for their losse as long as I lived. The Princess imagined by this disoourse that some accident had befallen Evander on the way, for that his arrivall must  have pleased them, and rather have obliged the King of Cambaya to Aispatch Pirabus in A∣naxanders behalf, than on the part of young Al∣cidaris, whose unfortunate birth a thousand times a day he cursed.
But, continuing her discourse, she asked him what assurance there was of the two Princes death which he lamented. Madam answered Pirabus, the common report hath instructed us in that unfortunate adventure, they had in Visapo∣rus, where they so beastlike were condemn'd to death: I know of each particular said Orazia, but certainly they died not there. Tis true, Madam, replyed Pirobus that they died not in that conflict; but when Visaporus was besirged, where the fair Orixa died of her Feavor a little after the King of Decan her father was murthered in his flight, by a serving-man, and, that that cruell end which was not yet come to her know∣ledge, had caused that of the Queen her mother, who sunk under the burden of her sorrow, you have understood, how the two Princes, Araxus, and Demonax, finding themselves put hardly to it, & fearing the two staves who desired but their lives, caused Anaxander, and Piroxenus our Ma∣slers, to think fit to hazard a sally upon the ene∣my, it being the only way they could attempt to avoid the funy of Rozinloan, and Zabain, who would reign without impediment. Now, we are told, Madam, of all those who escaped living from that fatal sally, that our Masters were there slain, together with the two Princes of Decan; had it not been so, we should undoubtedly have since heard of them, but their deaths have been confirmed to us by so many, that 'twere too great mincredulicy to doubt thereof. The beautiful Orazia seeing that this suppo∣sed death of Anaxander, and Piroxenus, wrought
so real a sorrow in Pirobus, did think it charity to tell him the truth: however, not willing to do any thing without Anaxanders consent, and seeing that the King her father had yet three daies to remain in Baticalus, where the Embassi∣dour had stayed him, she dispatched Saradin, whom she could only trust, and gave him charge to hasten to her Lover, with this advertisement, and to come back ere Pirobus (who was to do part the day following) should return for Gouza∣rat. Meanwhile, when the Embassadour taking his leave kissed her hand, she could not forbear saying to him, that she believed those he sorrow∣ed son, were alive. Saradin immediately mounted on an excel∣lent Courser, galloped with all speed to his own home, and finding the two Princes together, for that Piroxenus since Anaxanders hurts, had not stirred out of his sight, he related to them the comming of Pirobus, the subject of his Embassage, and the discourse he entertain'd the Princess with, which much astonish'd them, and made them believe, that poor Evander was dead on the way. They deliberated sufficiently what to do hereupon, and whether it were not best to dis∣cover themselves upon that occasion, seeing that if they endured the Prince Alcidaris his sute, it might be feared, that the King of Cambaya, re∣solute upon that match, might in very few daies hasten the accomplishment. On the other side, Anaxander held it no way safe to declare him∣self so soon after that Combat, which had so much displeased the King, and did most wisely
foresee, that they might be blamed by an impu∣tation, that being by reason of the greatnesse of their bi ths assured from the punish neut, they had most rashly broken am Edict, which them∣selves ought to have preserved inviolable, with∣in the Dominions of a King, whom they loved, and to whom they sought to be allied: t length, after full consideration, knowing hat Pirobus was the next day to depart from Baticalus, they resolved that Piroxenus should go all that night to way-lay him at his first daies lodging, and make himself privately known to him and trust with his discretion, the truth of all their adven∣tures. Saradin took leave of them in this resolu∣tion, and very glad that Anaxander did so well of his hurts, there being hope that three weeks time would make him well, returned to him Mi∣stresse, who on her side rejoyced infinitely, as well for the recovery of her Love, as for the pur∣pose Piroxenus had taken. As soon than, as the Embassadour had received the Kings commands, and the two Princesses of Narsinga, & Zeylan, and that he was departed for Baticalus, he was amazed to finde at his first jour∣neys end, the King his Masters Nephew, the ge∣nerous Prince of Citor expecting him: he at first took it for an illusion which deceived his eyes, but, when by his face, and action, and speech he knew him to be Piroxenus, he cast himself up n one knee, and weeping for joy, strove to have kissed his hand. But Piroxenus raising him up, venerable Pirobus, said he, my Cousin Anaxander, and my self have understood the cause of your
journey by a Gentleman, whom the Princess Orazia sent unto us, and because the request you have made the King of Narsinga, is utterly opposite to the contentment, of your young Prince, who contrary to the belief you have had, is still alive, I am as well in my own as his behalf, come hither to salute you, and to acquaint you, with the reasons obliging us to remain yet un∣known in this Kingdom. And here Piroxenus made him an ample rehearsall of all their adven∣tures, and whatever good or evill had befallen them since their sally out of Visaporus, where so many men thought they had both come short. The good Pirobus felt so great astonishment at this recitall, and so great a joy, as with much difficulty could he make him answer; at length, having recollected his senses, and the liberty of his tongue. Sir said he, is it possible that two great Princes as ye are would for meer pastime endure so many troubles, and crosses? Ah, how the gods have been favourable to us contrary to all expectation in restoring us the true props of our Crown, and disengaging our spirits from the just fear we had to yield in subjection all our lives unto a vicious Prince. And than he would have told him of the evill nature of Alcidaris, but that Piroxenus let him know that they had understood the whole story. Well than (Sir) said Pirohus what please you that I do, will you have me go back, and change my errant to A∣naxanders behalf? I think the King his father will never disavow it, and the King of Narsinga, who hath been a witnesse of his vallour, will be glad
to conclude the match without drawing breath, and specially, when I shall let him know, his daughter whom he loves so dearly shall be desi∣rous of it. No, father (said Piroxenus) seeing is hath so fallen out, that sage Evander, to whom we declared our intensions, and whom we have de∣sired to regain the Kings good graces for us, hath met with some misfortune, go you with speed and supply his room, and obtain that the acts of our youth may be forgotten; thanks to the gods we have committed nothing worthy to be disa∣vowed for rude, or evill natures, and I think tru∣ly we shall seem excusable it being considered, that if we have been faulty, tis but for having too much loved, and when it shall be seen, that we have not been so foolish, nor so stupi'd but by our industry, we have obtained each of us a King∣dom. Gothen Pirobus, and the gods favour you, we will shortly follow as soon as Anaxander is recovered of his hurts: in the interim, do not for get to tell the King, and Queen, all that hath be∣fallen us, they will undoubtedly be much pleased at it, and especially, when they shall know, that my Orixa lives, and that her Kingdom, which we have helped to recoven from the two slaves, Usurpers, will be hers without dispute, when the King of Narsinga shall, as you do know the strange History of her life. Pirobus would fain have seen Anaxander be∣fore his return, but seeing that Piroxenus thought is not best, he went right to the port of God, to pursue his way to Gouzarat, and there to embark himself for saving much travel, and with tears in
his eyes departed from Piroxenus, who returned to his Cousin with all speed at Saradins Cafile, where we will leave him recovering his hurts, to tell you, what passed in the Kingdom of Cam∣baya. About eight or ten daies after Pircbus depar∣ture from Cumpanel, (the ordinary aboad of Alcidaris,) in his Embassage to the King of Nar∣singa; the good Evander, who long since went from Visaporus, and had been hardly used on the way by a great sicknesse, from which he had much a do to recover, being at length by the gods permission, restored, arrived happily at the Capitall City of Gouzarat: had there been no∣thing considerable, but his person, which was dear to the whole Kingdom, all the Court had recei∣ved an exceeding contentment at his comming; but when from him in was known, that the two Princes were living, and that from the time they were supposed to be dead, they had performed a thousand; goodly actions, Bonefires were kindled through the City, and there was not one, from the greatest to the least, who did not witness one equall impatience for their return, upon which they already established all the hope and safety which the rudeness of young Alcidaris had even ravish'd from them. But that publique joy, however great, was no∣thing in comparison of the Kings and Queen A∣nazarettes, who weary of the impertenencies of that Prince, ill affected by every body, which they had still before their eyes, and having for∣gotten all their anger, and resentments caused by
the idle absence of Anaxander, and Piroxenus, whom indeed they had believed dead, sailed not from that instant to make vows, and prayers for their preservation, and return. They caused their adventures to be told them a thousand times over, wherein, they could not enough admire the goodness of the gods, which had preserved them: their greatest wonder was, that Orixa yet lived, and had they heard it from others mouth then Evander, who had been witnesse of her re∣surrection, they might had cause to doubt it; for Alcidaris had understood by report, that her pretended death had been one of the principall causes, that had obliged our two young Princes to make that great sally, wherein it was belie∣ved they were slain: but when they knew by E∣vander, how, contrary to all hope she was reco∣vered out of that deadly swound, and that she was alive, and well, in a private quality under the name of Asteria, in the City of Visaporus, which had been yield to the two slaves, and in which capitulation, he had assisted, they wondered more than ever; for they had known all that had past since that Siege (during Evanders sickness in De∣can; they had learnt how Rozalcan, and Zaha∣in, having in pursuit of their tyrannical victory, usurped the Province of Canara from the King of Narsinga, had been castised by the Prince A∣rontus: in short, they were not ignorant that that Prince aided by two valliant Persian Cavalliers, whom they had heard named Ariomant, and Ca∣listenus, had regained whatsoever was unjustly usurped by the slaves, which were in Battel de∣feated,
the gain whereof, had cost the generous Prince Arontus life. Sir said Evander, inter∣rupting him, he who hath done so many wonders under the name of Ariomant, is no other than your son Anaxander, and that Calistenus is his Cousin, who hath given no lesse testimony of himself by his arms. That word so much re∣doubled the joy of the Kings heart, as it shewed plainly in his countenance, and the good Evan∣der, ravish'd to see their Majesties so attentive to his discourse, continued it as followeth. When they purposed to disguise themselves under those two names, because they had been too well known by those of Taxilus, and Cleon∣tus, which besides had been so satal to them; they acquainted but their Gentlemen Almerin, and Neander, and my self, with that secret, and caused Neander, (who was carried sorely hurt into the besieged City) to entreat me, that I would ha∣sten to you obtain your favor for them, which they believed lost: but my misfortune stay'd me on the way, in a remote place from all com∣merce, where 'twas impossible to let you know what was become of me, or of the Princes. Un∣doubtedly they are yet with the King of Narsin∣ga, unknown to any save the fair Orazia, to whom your dear Anaxander, before he went from hence did vow himself. He afterwards told them, whatsoever he knew of the History of the Loves of those two generous Princes, which was likely to have made Alcidaris to send another Embassadour instantly to the King of Narsinga, but Evander diverted it: for seeing the War was
ended, he assured the King, that they would re∣turn, at soon as Arontus Funerals were solemni∣zed, for which they had under stood so many sad preparation were making, in the City of Bati∣calus. The King and Queen, then ezpect Pirobus his return, who could not be long ere he came, in∣tending to send him instantly back again in case they learnt that some new obstacle stayed those two Hero's in Narsinga. And to expresse the great contentment which they had received from Evanders news, and the other great services he had done them, they gave him the Government of Bazain, which had of late been vacant, and as soon as the good old man had a little reposed himself at Campanel, he departed by the King and Queens leave, to take possession of it, promising to be with them again by that time Pirobus should be returned, to resolve with their Majesties of what were best to be done for Anaxanders con∣tentment: for they were already resolved fully, to give Orazia to him, in case that Pirobus had obtained the promise of her, and thought the change would not be unacceptable to the King of Narsingas, who had been witness of the fair deeds of their young Prince. Not above three daies after, the good Evan∣ders arrival at Bazain, about the evening, out of the Port guard came to tell him, that there was arrived a forein Vessel weather beaten, & seemed to be rather forced in by contrary winder, than come voluntary, wherein were two Cavalliers of good countenance, who craved leave to refresh
themselves in the Town, the most eminent of them was in ill case, being hurt in divers places of his body. Now by reason that place was of great importance to the King of Cambaya, they accustomed to keep a good guard, and to suffer none to enter, whose name, and quality and bu∣siness thither was not known, and because those two Gentlemen who arrived then newly in that Vessel, being ignorant of the custom, had refused to name themselves, advertisement was given the Governor, and his farther pleasure deman∣ded. Evander imagining, that it might happily be the two young Princes, his Pupels, who it may be, would not discover themselves, till they came to Court, and surpriz: all people, he went him∣self unto the Haven, and borded the Bark, where∣in he found a young Knight lain all his length up∣on a Matteresse, who althuogh he seemed greatly suffering by his hurts, which the tempest, had augmented, shewed notwithstanding, a certain majesty in his eyes and face, which made him re∣verenced of all that saw him. Evander knew well enough, that twas some personage of note; and as he was extremely full of charity, and hos∣pitable, seeing the Gentleman who accompa∣nied him, would not tell his name, he thought however that the laws of civility did command and oblige his succour, and to offer them not on∣ly the Town, but his Castle also, for their better accomodation. The strangers accepted his offer, and so much care was had of him, that was hurt; as that in eight, or ten daies, he gave un∣doubted signes of an approaching health. Now,
as he was very generous, and infinitely sensible of the good entertainment, and usage shewn him by Evander, her thought he could not do lesse in gratitude, than discover himself unto him, that he might know he had obliged Lisimantus; that vallorous Lisimantus, who had got so great a fame, and whose glorious name was renowned through all Asia. Poor Lisimantus, how much had it been better, that thou hadst not discovered thy self, than to have payed so dearly for the ho∣nor given thy excellent vertues, at thy first com∣ming, at lest shouldest thou have been contented to have told thy name, without particulars of thy quarrel, which will set thee into the strangest con∣fusion, thou yet ever sawest. Evander, knowing that this stranger was the valiant Lisimantus, who had so worthily served the King of Zeylar, and who so lately had per∣form'd so brave exploits in the Kingdom of Nar∣singa, had a double cause of being glad not only, for that he had it in his power to oblige a man of that condition, but that the assured himself, he should learn news of Anaxander, and Piroxenus under the borrowed names of Ariomant, and Calistenus: but before he enquired, seeing that the Cavallier disposed himself to recount unto him his adventure, and how after being so grievously hurt he came to the Port of Bazain: being very glad to be enformed, willingly gave his attension, and Lisimantus innocently began his discoarse, without considering what manner of man he was to speak unto, or what kinde of people he was to have to do with.
Know (said he) most reverend father, that al∣ter my triumph over the King of Maldives, and if I had set all the Island of Zeylan at quiet, and been very helpful to the King of Narsingas peace, I quitted the Wars; and finding again in Batica∣lus the only object of my passion, that adorable Lisimena, who had alwaies payed my love with ingratitude, and but whose name, I well per∣ceive I shall alone possess, my flames renewed, and I felt my self so to the quick sollicited by my a∣morous desires, as I used all manner of subtilties, and invention to be in private with her: but she ungrateful, who never sufficiently acknowledge the services which I have done her Crown, aug∣menting her disdains, as my pains grew, instead of enduring me neer her, as my fidelity alone ob∣liged her enough, rebuking and repelling who∣soever spake to my advantage, she at length com∣mitted the most notable Treason against me, that was ever contrived against a miserable Lover. There was in the King of Narsinga Court, a young Knight of Persia, very accomplished in∣deed and worthy of great praise, who having by much industry the honor to be known by her, was notwithstanding, preferred before my long and faithfull services. I understood by a little Page of the Princessers that every night, he was brought secretly into her company, and spent six hours together with her, and how that ungrate∣full Princess breathed nought but love for him: I will not deny, but that hereat, so jealous a mad∣ness in such sort transported me, as not able to
endure the happinesse of that Rival I waited for him on an evening, where he vsed to passe to∣wards his amorous randezvous, and not able for my anger to understand his reasons, I call'd him instantly to fight with me. Evander who with impatience looked that he should name that young Knight, and finding that he was too long about it, interrupting him, demanded it. His name was Ariomant, (said Lisimantus;) and well said Evander, full of fear, what is become of him, I slew him, said Lisimantus; and truly I have since lamented it, for a more valiant Knight I ne∣ver met. He was about to continue on his discourse, and tell them how after the death of Ariontant, whom he verily believed was slain, (because Zenobus had assured him, that he saw him stretched out in his blood without warmth, or motion) being in but little better case himself, he was carried to a Bark, which attended him, and how thinking to avoid the coast of Zeylan, to shun the King of Narfinga his anger, whose Edict they had broken, a con∣trary winde arising, which begot a furious tem∣pest, had cast them on the Coast of Cambaya, neer the Haven of Bazain. He was (I say) about to have recounted all these particulars, but that he was prevented by an accident which did sur∣prize him, and which no lesse a mazed all that were about him, that himself; for at the recital of Ariomants death, Evander fell into a swound, on Lisimantus bed. They all ignorant of the reason of this suddain change, threw water in his face, and when he was come to himself, which a
deep sigh, cry'd out my friends, we have embra∣ced the murtherer of your and my Master, and uttering these words, he gave plain evidence of a second weaknesse which grew on him; but being prevented by the ready help administred. Unhappy, and most cruel hospitallity (said he) we shew kindenesse, and are civil unto one, who vaunts, that he hath cut our Princes throat, and who unjustly stirred his courage, and without cause provoked it; Let the wicked man be set safe (added he) and seaze upon his second in the quarel; and as they are, let them be instantly conveighed towards the King, that even him∣self may order what he please concerning them. Immediately the guard that was with Evan∣der bound the poor Lisimantus, as he lay in bed so weak, but half recovered of his hurts, and seaz'd on Zenobus as well, whom with his friend they put into a Chariot, to carry them without delay to the City of Catupanel, where the King of Cambaya was. The people of Bazain when they knew that those two prisoners which passed in the Chariot, had slain their Prince Anaxander, for the acceptable news of whose safety, they had lately made Bonefires, were so provoked, as had it not been for Evanders authority which restrai∣ned them, I verily believe they had stoned to death those two unhappy ones or else dismem∣bred them alive. On the other part, the generous Lisimantus having from the first, known for what cause he had been used so rigorously, by a man from
whom be had received so much countesse, e∣pented him, but too late, for having named him whom he abought he had seperated from the world, and whom till that time he had taken but for an ordinary Knight: but seeing that after the Laws of hospitality, so sweetly observed in favor of him, so great inhumanity was used to∣wards him, his great courage could no longer commin, and addressing himself to Evander, who accompanied him on horseback, compassed a∣bout with Halberts: What means all this (my father said he) must I be like those ancient sacri∣fices which were wont to be crowned with flow∣ers before their being slain? do you believe that all those praises you have given me, and flowers of Rhetorick which you have prodigally wasted in my behalf, do make your cruelty the sweeter? what cursed custom is it you practise, to make such fair appearance to those, you do design for punishment, like those Sea-monsters, who seeming amiable, charm the passengers with their plea∣sing voice, for no other end but to destroy them? Is't after that sort you are hospitable to strangers? Is't so you use the afflicted, who seek their shelter in your arms, when they are under persecution of their evill fortune? Evander withdrew him∣self behinds the Chariot for fear he might be for∣ry; his heart was in such manner wounded, as he considered but his own grief, and in that sense of his Lords death, was nothing moved by Lisimantus reproaches, or complaints. But in the mean time, that the false news of Anaxanders death, shall with him be carried to
the King of Cambaya, at Campanel, lets make a turn into Narsinga, to see how he does of his wounds; and the Kings departure from Batica∣lus, to return for Bisnagar. As soon as that magnanimous Prince had an∣swered Pirobus his demand, and that he had sent him back, laden with presents, and honors, and having no more to do in the Province of Canara, and finding that notwithstanding the strict search of the Combatants, no news was to be had; after having placed a new Governor over Baticalus, in Zenobus his stead, he departed with his whole Court, but carried with him, his re∣sentment, and wrath against those, who with so much impudence had violated his Edict, and re∣solv'd where ever they were found, to punish them with rigor. The fair Orazia, who saw him willfull in that bloody resolution, was much disquieted, and her heart troubled, with divers, and sundry motions, when she perceiv'd the Court drew neer to Saradins Castle, wherein was hid, the richest treasure of her soul: if on the one side, her fear of his discovery did trouble her, the pleasure of her hope to see him, was so acceptable, as both compar'd, her joy was greater than her sorrow, and her hope prevail'd above her fear. At worst, she thought the danger of his being found in that place, would not be great, because it would be easie for her to prove his birth, as well by A∣rintus declaration, whose letter she kept, as by Lisimena's testimony, who had heard all the ad∣ventures of his life. However, though she found
much safety in all these proofs, shew was not with out fear, when the King whom she saw so severe entred the Castle, she at first imagined, that some of Saradins people who had seen the two Princes comming, might for hope of recompence betray them: but she was soon assured by the Master of the house, who answered for the truth of those that guarded them, and who promis'd she should see them, if she might trust one off her women, for they were lodged over her Chamber. He had forbidden the way to that retired part of the house, making the harbengers believe, that they were Store-houses, where he had set cer∣tain Houshold-stuff, and reserv'd it for himself alone, and those who had care of the princes, and the way to go unto them when he pleased. In so much, as when night came, the Princesses, who would lye together they often did, feigning to be weary of their journey, retired betimes, and would not suffer any of their women to lie that night in their Chamber; they only call'd for a watch light, for Orazia seemed, as if she would read in her bed. When they were laid, they sent away their women, not daring to trust any one of them, and when every body was asleep, they rose softly, & cloathed one the other, to go to Saradin, who expected them at the door, and was to conduct them, where the two Princes were; Orazia would never endure that any other should have knowledge of that important secret, which she would have conccaled even from her dear Lisimena, however well she was assured of her faith fulness, had not her company been then so necessary to her.
This fair stranger Princess, had never been at ease since Lisimantus combat; for as I have alrea∣dy said, she Iov'd him secretly in her heart, al∣though her glorious courage never suffered her to shew it; and for she had understood nothing of him, she feared somewhat worse had besaln him, than had to Anaxander, and what was grie∣vous to her, was, that she dar'd not openly en∣quire after him, besides, that very few were able to say what had become of him: But Orazia promis'd her, to enquire of Piroxenus, who bet∣ter than any other, could tell whiter hee were alive or not, being he, who had advanced him∣self to purt them, and who had found them in the lamentable case, which I have told you. Each then cast a robe about her, and fitted their hair as well as they could, and their naturall graces sur∣passing all, that art could adde unto them, they thus went, to the sick Princes Lodgings, where Saradin conducted them. As soon as Anaxander saw appear before his eyes, the onely beauty of the world which hee a∣dored, accompanyed with her dear, and faith∣full Lisimena: My Ladies (cryed he out) is it possible that you have done me this honor, & take so much pains for a subject of so mean importance? Recover your self once brave Anaxander, answered Orazia, and you shall see of what im∣portance your health is to my contentment. But I conjure you to conceal your self as much as you can, whiles you are in our Countreys; for the King my Father, to whom you will not yet discover your self, thunders, extremely against
you; and my self, as well for diversion of his wrath, as that you might surprize him wholly at your return, have sowen the newes of your death through all the Court. Were it true indeed, re∣plyed Anaxander, your only presence, and words, comming from so fair a mouth in my favour, were sufficient to restore me again to life. But, Madam, do not think that I can conceal my self, however carefull I may be to do it, nor, do you think, that my wounds are secret, no more than those which your fair eyes have caused in the bottom of my heart; since you are privy to my evils, I believe all the world is full of them, wher∣in you only are to me considerable. But, said he, smiling, and flriving to take the Princess hand to kiss it, I believe, Madam, you are come hither of purpose, to tell me of the good fortune, which the marriage of my Brother Alcidaris pro∣mises you, to whose merit you are dedicated; and that you do me the honour to visit me, as your Brother in Law, rather than as your ser∣vant; the Princess who could not endure jesting upon that subject, I do not think, said she, with a cone more serious, that you have misunder∣stood the answer I gave Pirobus, and which I by and by communicated to you by Saradin; to wit, that I accounted my self too happy, in that heaven had ordained the most perfect and accomplish'd Prince of Gouzarat to be my hus∣band; for you know better than I, that that praise can belong to man save your self, and that having made me know the wants of Alcida∣ris, I should seperate my self as far from his sute, as you are from his ill behaviour.
Anaxander could not forbear laughing, to see her justifie her self so seriously, in thing, which she had said to his advantage, and finding, that she was a little moved: How, Madam, said he, would you have so ill an opinion of me, as to be perswaded, that I should think you guilty of lo∣ving a sot? I pray believe, I have too good a one of my self, and that I have too many testimonies of your love, to imagine you were pleased with Alcidaris sute; but I thought, that in talking of so ridiculous a man, a little sport had not been out of season; and to say the truth, although he be my Brother, I cannot think on the description made me of him, without bursting with laughter. During their entertainment with such like discourse, the Princess of Zeylan entertained Pi∣roxenus, and without seeming to have any interest in Lisimantus safety, making him tell her every particular of the combat, she understood, that he had been carried (very much hurt) aboord his bark, but that he thought him not in worse plight than Anaxander, and that where ever he was, he thought him still living. This assurance gave great cause of comfort to Lisimena, who in truth, feared nothing more in the world, than the death of that accomplish'd Knight, who had performed as many brave actions, for the love of her, as of himself; besides, that she knew that last encounter grew, but from the extreme affection he bare her, which was grown to such a pass, as in his very despair he could endure norivals. They were all four, more than two houres to∣gether, having no other witness of their content∣ment
but Saradin: but when there was a word of parting, sorrow trod short upon the heels of joy. And what ever means Orazia used to dis∣semble her displeasure, it was so plain to see in her fair eyes, bedew'd with tears, as Anaxander could not restrain himself from seconding them with his, in that tender motion which did seaze him, and a thousand times kissing that adorable Princesse hands, he made her as many protestati∣ons of eternall constancy; then, in presence of three witnesses, they renewed with extreme, and reciprocall affection, their promises of mariage, which they had formerly made in Baticalus, de∣siring the Gods to exterminate the first of them, that should break faith. They being thus fortified by that mutuall as∣surance, finished their adieus, wherein, Anaxan∣der promised his Princesse, that believing himself to be able in a short space to depart from thence for Gouzarat, he would return sooner than she thought, for the accomplishment of both their wishes. The night being well spent, the two fair Princesses returned to their Chamber, where they entertain'd themselves untill day, which no sooner appeared, but the King, who was already cloathed, caused them to be advertis'd that they should make themselves ready to depart, if they desired to avoid the heat of the day, which the beginning threatned; they shut not their eyes all that night, and yet Orazia, desiring nothing more in the world than that the King her fa∣ther were departed from that Castle, where she had never been in quiet; she suddainly made her
self ready, and having again sent a new comple∣ment by Saradin to Prince Anaxander, she ascen∣ded (with Lisimena) her Chariot, and so follow∣ing the Kings, she little and little, lost sight of the Castle, which as long as she was able she kept within her eye. The amorous Prince, whom she had left be∣hinde her, paid full dearly for the pleasure of her visit; for he was so much moved by excesse of joy, which his Mistresse presence caus'd him, as he fell into a violent Feavor, which accident ve∣ry much retarded his recovery: but let us leave him to amendment by a long rest, untill a per∣fect health grow on him: Lots likewise leave the King of Narsinga arrived at Bisnagar, where he did a thousand honors to the Princesse Lisimena, who would not permit him to accompany her, any farther; and let us suffer that fair Princess to depart, who although she returned to the King her father, and to an Island, which the Arabians In their tongue call the land of delights, and the Indians, the Paradise of the earth; and that over and above those considerations, she hoped to see her Love again there, could not chuse but be ex∣tremely afflicted, en departing from Orazia, she lost the sweetest conversation she had in the world. Let us I say, leave all these matters as they are, and return to Cambaya, and see that unfortunate Knight, whom Evander conducted to the great ALcidaris, arrive as Campanel, and who had unawares accus'd himself of Anaxanders death. As soon as the King was told of that sad news,
it was as much as he could do to live for torrow. Unfortunate Anaxander (said he,) must I lose thee again the second time, and be deceived so soon of the hope was given me, that I should see thee yet alive? Ah, Evander, how unacceptably hast thou vifited me? my rage was over, and I had dryed my tears, caused by the imaginary losse of my son, and thou hast let me know his being a∣live, and his brave actions, but to increase my sorrow for his death indeed. Great was his grief, but the Queens extream; That fair Princesse, who was but newly come from giving the Gods thanks, for the recovery of her only son whom she had so lamented, touch'd to the quick by the sense of that irrepa∣rable losse, and for that time losing all patience, and accustom'd modesty, could not for bear accu∣sing heaven, and injuring its powers. Ye unjust gods (said she) whom too in vain I have invo∣ked, with so great fervency, and zeal for my sons safety, I see plainly ye are deaf, that have not heard me: he that burns insense on your Altars foully deceives himself, your power is but opini∣on; or have you any, it serves but to offend those, that distressed, make their vows to you. Alas I had regain'd my dear child, but for invoking you, and you even since my vows, and prayers, have snatch'd him from me. I perceive, my dear Anaxander, that I have lost thee for ever, I shall no more see thee in this world, and yet where ere thou art I am resolv'd to seek thee, and die for sorrow, if no other remedy: But ere that be, I mean to satisfie thy good Angel, and since thy
murtherer is fallen into our hands, I promise thee to be revenged on him. These sorrows served but to augment the Kings displeasure, who was strucken to the heart, as well may be a father who hath lost the honor of his house, and hope of his Kingdom: Howe∣ver, he was infinitely just, and generous, seeing it was that brave Lisimantus whom Evander had brought, whose known vallour was renowned every where, he thought it would be too great an act of basnesse, and inhumanity, to revenge his sons death on him, who had slain him like a gal∣lant man in Duel, and unknown, but by a bor∣rowed name, which he had taken; and thought it an action of a great King, to send him to the King of Zeylan without punishment, and seeing too, that Anaxander could not live by tother death. But however absolute he was in his Kingdom, he could not then be Master, his Subjects too much loved the memory of their Prince, to suffer his murtherer to scape unpunished whom they had in their custody: And seeing that the great Alcidaris inclin'd to mercy, all the Judges as∣sembled themselves suddainly, and seconding the Queens angry purposes, they hastned Lisimantus judgement, and that very day condemned him to die. As for Zenobus, they judged him to a perpetual imprisonment, who had not scap'd so cheap, but that he averred himself overcome by Piroxenus, whom he assured them, he left alive, and weeping by his dead friend. When the sentence of Lisimantus condemnati∣on
was read unto him, that great and invincible courage, which had scorned death in all the shapes and forms it ever had appeared to him in, was shaken by that so severe and terrible judg∣ment. He fiercely look'd upon the bringer of those cruel tidings, and his rage prevailing, in his sense of that cruelty shewn on him: Thou wicked man (said he,) who serv'st the fury of the most barbarous people of the world, hast thou impudence enough to come and outrage me in the miscrable condition I am in, and pub∣lish with a ceremony, the injury prepared for my innocence? My name, which hath made so many Nations to tremble, and is so regarded through the Indes; shall it be so much scorn'd by you, as you will dare condemn me for an ho∣norable action? Will ye be so unworthy, as to stain the memory of your Princes death, who did so valiantly defend himself, and make me bear so many marks of his courage? Can I believe I do converse with men, where reigns so great in humanity. Where is that generous Alcidaris, whose praises are so ignorantly sung throughout all Asia? He suffers me to be a prey unto his Sub∣jects fury, and endures that, after having led a life full of honor, I be put to a shameful death under his own eyes? The Officer, who was in truth a generous and compassionate man, and touched at the misery of that famous Knight, reply'd thus to him. I come with sorrow, brave Lisimantus, to execute the sad commission given me against you: but con∣sider, that my charge requires it of me, and that
I must, whatever justice bids me. Were it, your safety did depend on me, you should be soon made free; I have admired long your vertue, and however far from your profession, I cannot but do reverence to men like you. But what, in this disability wherein I am, can I tender you but vows unprofitable, and pray the gods to give you resolution enough to bear your evill fortune pa∣tiently? Do not accuse Alcidaris, he wishes you at liberty, and believe me, his subjects have hast∣ned your condemnation, but since they saw his nature willing to remit you; He is not this day master of his peoples wills, who are doubly a∣nimated against you, as well by the strong moti∣ons of the Queen, as by their own resentments. What manner of Country must it be, replyed Lisimantus, where the King is govern'd by his Subjects; he that forbids not evill, does com∣mand it; and truly, though divine and humane Lawes, did not condemn Alcidaris cruelty, yet she honour he professes should perswade him to defend me. He, to whom all power is given, should shew it less than others, and you will g rant me, that your Prince uses too insolently his au∣thority, and makes too poor a use of my calamity; Well, well, Death will deliver me from his ty∣ranny, but he shall not be freed from his neighbors blame. I will let him see, I can tell how to die, and that the crosses of my fortune, are not able to shake my Resolution, nor deject my Courage; 'Tis true, 'tis hard to part with life at so young an age: but 'twould be more intollerable if I feared Death; I know I live to dye, and that the
very day of my Birth, nature sets limits to my dayes; and besides an unworthinesse of heart, it were a folly in me, to fear what I cannot avoid; I have so often beheld Death, as my eyes are ac∣quainted with him, and I call the gods to witness, nothing aftonishes me, but the manner of my dying. I pass the headsmans hands? ah, who soere thou art that look'st with pitty on me, and are touch'd with my misfortune, if thou have any credit with the King, or those that seek my life, obtain of them, that either a Dagger, or poy∣son, satisfie their cruelty? Excuse me from the shame prepared for me, and permit not, that I outrage nature so much, as to deliver my self out of their hands, which doubtlesse I should rather do, than to expect their punishment. This compassionate Officer was so touched, that the tears came in his eyes, at those last words, and curseda thousand times, that day, wherein for his preferment, he was taken from his ordinary commerce with men, to be a Judge of their lives: he then drew near Lisimantus to comfort him, and to offer him all the aid was in his power; and however dark the Prison might at first en∣trance seem, yet, by a little stay and accustoming the fight thereto, it was casie enough for one man to know an other by his face; and therefore Lisi∣mantus who thought he knew the sound of that voice which spake unto him, but could not possi∣bly call him to mind, seeing him so near, knew him perfectly, not having seen him in twelve or thirteen years before; and crying out, My Father, said he, casting his arms about his neck,
is it possible that you are that good, and vertuous Eurimedes, who brought me into the world, and whose name I once bare? If my eyes do not deceive me, say, what occasion brought you hither, and what strange fortune made you leave the Trade you drove at Diu, to weare the gown, that you might condemn your own Son to death? The good Eurimedes, (for he it was indeed) was so astonisht at these words, as remaining a good space without speaking; O yee immortall Gods, said he, what do I hear, what see I, what miracle is this? Which Lisimantus hearing, suffi∣ciently confirm'd in what he beleeved: Oh my Father (said he) I know you without doubt, and see, the Gods for punishment of my forsaking your house, and raising my self beyond my duty, in forein parts, and shaming my birth, which I have till this time conceald from all the world, will have me once appear before you, for my more Confusion, and to have my Condem∣nation from your mouth; O how justly for∣tune deales thus with me, and how reason∣ably may she repent her of her favours so pro∣digally bestowed on me? I have treated in Equality with Kings, I have pratled with the fairest Princesses of Asia, I have commanded ar∣mies, I have every day layd new foundations for vanity, and conceiv'd new hopes of greatnesse, I have reckoned of the goods of fortune as mine own; and now, she takes them, not only all, at once from me, but Entrenches on the honor I have gotten with my sword, and does not spare my life, whereof she formerly hath seem'd to be
so tender; This (my Father) makes me see, that the world is but vanity, that its greatnesse after which so many ambitious spirits run, is but va∣por and smoak, which slips out of ones hand, when fastest seeming to be held, and that the whole stock of her prosperities, are frayl, and mutable. Eurimedes, who by this time doubted no more that it was the very child which he had lost, and precious pledg which Pirobus had made him for∣merly responsable for; and for his better satis∣faction pray'd him to let him see his right arm naked, where finding the Arms of Gouzarat im∣printed, and his conscience troubled for what he was compelled long ago to do: he cast himself upon his knees before Lisimantus, and acknow∣ledging him for his lawfull Lord; Great Prince, (said he to him) if you have been elevated by your courage, and ambition, if you have treated equally with Princes, and if you have comman∣ded Armies, you have done nothing unanswera∣ble to your birth, or unworthy of your illustrious parents. Know my Lord, that you are son unto the great Alcidaris, and only to avoid the blame, which I had had, for not producing you, being required of me, when you fled from my house, I was fain to imprint the Royal arms of Cam∣baya in my childs arm, which was set on yours, to know you by, when you should be taken out of my hands; That child my Lord, whom I dare not own, is he, who unjustly at this day, holds your room, and for whom, all the Court and the King himself have so little good opinion: I make
you this comession with shame, and I, who am his father, ask your pardon, if necessity enforcing me, I have so ill supplyed your place. Lisiman∣tus surpriz'd with wonder, and astonishment, caused Eurimedes to rise, and prayed him to tell him what he knew of the truth of his History; which he did from the beginning to the end, and recounted to him, how Alcidaris got him on the Queen Bernica his first wife; and forced by his passionate love unto QUeen Anaxarete, who re∣sisted his sute, because he had a son, he was con∣strain'd to suffer his fatherly affection, to give place to the violence of his love: in conclusion, he recited to him, from point to point, how Pirobus had trusted him to his education, that he changed his name Alcidaris, into his own Eurimedes, lest in progresse of time, he might be known for the Kings, and that he might be bred among his children, and passe for one of them, untill he should be called to Court, and used as himself, the heir of the Crown. But my Lord added he, when you had stollen from me, because Pirobus had exceedingly recommended you to my wife, and self, and that we received a great pay yearly for you, we could not doubt but that you were of great extraction; in so much, as for the fear of being punished if you were found wanting, as for the losse of a great Pension which we recei∣ved; I thought it best, together with my wife (having seen after what manner, the Arms of Cambaya had been printed on your arm) to do the like to one of our children, who was very neer your age, and shape, and colour'd hair, and
is the same who at this day, draws all the Court after him, and thinks, he is the only heir of all those Kingdoms which expect you. Indeed, had he been of a better inclination, and of other breeding than he is, my fortune had been grea∣ter; But the King taking him for his son, and believing that he got with me those evil customs and habits, which he hath by nature only; he thought it sufficient to take me from my trassique, and give me an Office, which was then vacant in the Criminal Chamber of Justice, in Campanel, wherein I am Commissary general, of all Crimes against the Crown. In truth, the Office was but too good for me, and I accounted it still honora∣ble, untill this fatall day of your condemnati∣on, wherein, I have dishonored both it, and my self, by adhering to the beastlinesse of the Cam∣panelens, who covet to glory in the death of one of their Princes, by the ignominious losse of the other: but by the gods assistance I intend to pre∣vent it, I will go instantly and declare my know∣ledge to the King, and though it be a sad intel∣ligence to know you were your only brothers homicide, not knowing him, he must in sinte be comforted, that you are living, and his lawful race not quite extinct. In uttering these words without giving leasure to the Prince to reply, he left him in his prison, with new disquiets for ha∣ving slain a brother of so generous, and good a nature; and presently went to King Alcidaris, at whose feet he cast himself, and made him this discourse.
Eurimedes his Speech to King Aleidaris. SEeing your Clemency is infinite, most great and generous Monarch, I hope it may extend on me although unmeasurably guilty, and unworthy of a pardon for my fault. I am here cast at your Majesties feet, to ac∣cuse my self, for having given you, my own, instead of your son, and caused you, so great displeasures for his ill behaviours, accounting him your lawfull heir. But I am hopefull of your favour, having more offended through necessity, than malice, and for fear of angring you, than willing to offend you. Let your Majesty know, (great King,) that young Al∣cidaris, whom Pirobus did long since trust me with, in his Cradle, did in my house re∣ceive a handsome education, as he should have done in your Palace, and that his inclinati∣ons were so great, to goodnesse, from his infan∣cy, that I do verily believe it had been hard for him, to have done ill: But, though I seem'd his father, and that he had no other privilege above my children in my house, (as Pirobus directed me,) he could not chuse, but feel certain stings of glory, and elevate him∣self
to enterprizes, worthy of his Grandsires generosity; Scarce had he accomplished ten years of age, when he stole from me, and as from his own mouth I have learned, he hath since done actions never to be forgotten, and which I shall declare to your Majesty, when I have finished this. As soon as I know of yong Erimedes his flight, (for it was thought fit to name him after me,) I sent every way af∣ter him and despairing of his news, fearing he was of great birth, because of the strict charge was given with him, that he should be one day call'd for, (as since hath fallen out,) being very sure, that those who hadicommitted him to me, could not know him, but by the mark of your Arms, which they had printed on his right arm, I made use of that secret, learnt of Pi∣robus, to give the same character to one of my children, who was of his age, shape and hair. Tis he (Sir,) who at this day, holds his quality in your Court unjustly, who go∣verns himself so unhandsomly among your Subjects, and whose presence, hath hither to caused but greater sorrow for the losse of A∣naxander. No man (Sir) but I, could re∣veal this important secret to you, and were I without conscience, and a faithlesse man, I might have left things as they are, and have preferred the greatnesse of my own son, before
your lawful interests; it may be any man but my self, would have done injury to truth, for love of reign, and have forgot the fear of God, to be terrible himself: but were at that I lo∣ved not justice nor reason, as I do, I lov'd your Majesty too well, to suffer it to be prophaned longer, by a man of petty birth, whoe inno∣cent ambition, as well as my conjeraint, makes me crave humble pardon of your Ma∣jesty. Alcidaris, who was one of the best Princes of the world, exceedingly astonished at th ∣ty of this story, asked him, how long since he had found his son within this hour, answered Eurimedes, and by so strange an accident, as I know not whether your Majesty will receive more pleasure, or discontentment in it. Since, said the King, thou hast reveal'd the secret as soon as thou hast known it, tis like thou hadst no malice in thy action; rise, I forgive thee, on condition thou bring me my son, and hide no part of his adventures from me. Alas (Sir) reply'd Eurimedes, that brave Lisi∣mantus, who hath been the terrour of the Indes, and who is at this present contrary to your will, kept in your prisons, and a criminal condemn'd to death, is he of whom I speak, and who hath had the honour to be born from you. Ah ye gods, (cryed the King) is it possible? can I be so happy as to be father of so generous a child? but
what say I happy, should I be so unscrable, as to have begotten him, who hath murthered his own brother, and for a cursed point of honor hath for ever ravisht my dear Anaxander from me, the very hope of my old daies? Unhappy father that I am, shall I be alwaies so ill us'd of Fortune, as to be reduc'd to complain even of her favors? and shall I never receive one benefit from her hands, which is not follow'd by a thousand mis∣chiefs? I thought I had but one son, good man, and I have twice bewail'd his death, and he, whom contrary to my expectation I have found again, seems to appear, but to torment me more, and grieve me for the others losse. Ah (Sir) said Eurimedes, inter rupting his com∣plaintt, while I am speaking, the poor Prince is in despair, for knowing that Anaxander was his brother; and I am consident, he would as wil∣lingly have died himself, and would be glad to buy him again with his own life. Without more ado, (said the King,) let his Iront be struck off, and be he no longer injur'd; which way soe∣ver the gods have sent him me, I am obliged to receive him, considering his innocence of his brothers death; and that he hath such reason to share with me in the affliction, which without purpose he hath caused me. Then instantly not willing to publish this news, he secretly com∣manded the Captain of his guard, to take him out of prison, and bring him to him, at his Pa∣lace. This Prince accomplish'd, whom till that time, the King would not see, was yet very pale, as well
by reason of the wounds whereof he was scarce healed, as for the hard usage he had shewn him in the prison; yet was that want so supplyed, by the gracefulnesse of his behaviour, as though he came into the Kings Chamber with a sorrowful countenance, it hindred not, that all the Court admired him. As soon as he entred the room, he kneeled on the ground, and witnessed so much sorrow to the King his father, for the mis∣fortune befallen him, as that his Majesty was more afflicted for his grief that for his own. Son said he, embracing him, those are the ordinary shock; of fortune, you are not the first that hath unwit∣ingly destroyed his own blood, the stages are dai∣ly full of like examples, and not to seek so far, we have at home, and with our neighbours, others like them. Be comforted, my child, heaven cannot be angry for your innocent offence, it self is more than you guilty, which knowing your design, did not divert it; Believe at worst, the gods will pardon you because I do, and for your presence, paies me for all losses, and afflictions past. Ah, (Sir) reply'd Lisimantus, can you behold a wretch? which hath so highly outrag'd Na∣ture? a murtherer of his own blood, an abomi∣nable monster, which cannot with a thousand deaths, expiate the crime he hath committed? He had inlarged his complaints, had not the King interrupted him, and by his redoubled embraces, and his solid reasons overcome his earnestness in condemning himself; and then settling a lit∣tle his spirits, and by degrees changing discourse,
after he had made him fit down by him, caus'd him insensibly to fall upon the story of his life, and strange adventures, which he passionately desired to be told, from point to point, and how he had arrived to such high honhours, after ha∣ving secretly stollen from Eurimedes the Mar∣chants house, whom he took for his father. Which Lisimantus perceiving, to satisfie his de∣sire, and curiosity, thus presently began his dis∣course.
THE INDIAN HISTORY OF ANAXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The fift BOOK. I Confesse (great Monarch,) I have heretofore been proud of some things I have done; be∣cause I thought them high, considering my mean extracti∣on, as I thought mine own to be: but, at this present, knowing certainly, the honour I have to be, issued from your loynes, I grow asham'd for having done so little, and that I am no more worthy of the glory you afford me, in acknowledging me your son. However, to
satisfie the dence you have, to know how I ob∣tain'd honor, and advantages abroad, I will tell you in a few words; that though I thought my self Eurimedes his son, and kept in equal breed and habit with his own in the City of Diu, I for∣bare not, in those tender years to aspire to no∣bler, and more generous exercises than he caus'd us to be taught. If I saw a goodly horse, I long'd to be upon him; I delighted alwaies more to see a sword than a feather; and Eurimedes here present, can assure you, they found me oft∣ner at the Manage, and the Fencing school, than at my Grammar. Besides all this, I had so strong a passion to be gone out of that little City, where I was shut up, to see strange parts, which I had heard of, as being one day walking a good way off the City, on the Sea shoar, a private ship, ha∣ving there landed, I was not at all astonished when they took me, because they us'd me kindely, and after having much prais'd my prettynesse and beauty, they promis'd, they would give me to their King, who was one of the most generous Princes of the world. In part they kept their words with me, for indeed they carried me into Zeilan, which was the place of their birth: but instead of making a present of me, as they had promised, they sold me, to one of the greatest Lords, of that fair Island. They perswaded him, I was a poor Child, whom they had found, and bred up for Charity, because seeing me so pretty, and spritely, they might hope to make somewhat of me, and made me believe, that if I would gain my self a
fortune, and be bred among the great one, should say as they did. This Lord, who was called Arbiran, found me so pleasing, for my words, and actions, which (he said) were more than of a Child, and seeming as it were some∣what noble, that at the end of three Weekes, or a Moneth, that he had had me, having put me into very good Clothes, commanded me to wait on him to the Palace: and ask'd me, whether I would talk as well before the King, as I had done to him. I had at that time a great liberty of the Arabick tongue, which is the Mother Language of my reputed father, and which pas∣seth with estimation through all India, in so much, as Iassuring him, that I would do yet better, and that he should discern as much dif∣ference, as between the King, and himself, he was so touch'd with the grace I uttered those words, as he acquainted the Queen there∣with, who desired to see me, which having done, she would have me presently from him, to place me with the Princesse Lisimena, her onely daughter, who at that time was not above six years of age. Although I were unknown to all men, (because I rather chused to confirm what the Pirats had said of me, than confesse I was a Merchants Son) my face, and the gentlenesse of my actions, toge∣ther with my discourse, begot me much honour from all people, and to such a degree, as they held me fit to wear the Princes livery, wherein I was the first, and only Page a pretty while. And because I had according to the Pirates, assured
them, that my Parents were as unknown unto me, as my name, the Queen named me Euribal∣dus, which in that Country language significs a found Child. The Princesse, who at that innocent age had found the secret of making her self feared, appear∣ed the most beautifull thing that was ever seen, and already ravish'd all eyes, with admiration of so many graces, and perfections, as nature had bestowed upon her. She commanded me to be ever near her, and to follow her alwaies, as well because she saw every body lov'd me, as for I was the first Creature, over whom she had an abso∣lute power. But alass, she in time knew, that she had got much more than she desired: I found my self so ready for her commandt, and took so great contentment in her service, as although I had known at that time my extraction, I should have held my self very happy in the quality of her Slave, I was as ready to obey her, as she gracefull in commanding me; and though, that age did not allow me knowledge, of the force of Love; I could not but perceive, my cares, and my affections passed common duties. She had perceived it, as well as I, when on a day that she had praised me for somewhat I had done to her minde: Euribaldus (said she to me) well done, but I fear this passion will not last (Madam said I) I purpose it shall not end but with my life; And were my happiness such, as to be the greatest Monarch of the world, I would desire to be ever at your feet, nor should any consideration loose me from your service; Truly, said she, your ser∣vices
are not like those I expect from Prince That's my grief (Madam) answered I, with tears in my eyes, that I find not my self worthy to come near you, and that I cannot by important servi∣ces, recommend my self unto you. But how, said she, smiling, by what services wouldst thn make thy self more commendable unto me? by such replyed I, as proceed from my own incli∣nations, and my free will; when I do that which you command me, I do but what I ought, and what a threat of punishment, may force me to: But, if the gods, had made me of so free, and elevated a condition, as that I could of my self, have given you my self, and put me in such case, as you might like my services, that I might free lydie for you, and, where there might be quedi∣on of obeying you; I should finde but few things impossible. Although she were: but full ten years of age, her spirit forward, and her judgement formed, which supply'd the want of years, made her suf∣ficiently to apprehend my words; I observed, that when she would reply, she stuck twice or thrice upon the utterance, an assured note that she had understood me. I believe her first purpost was, to answer me sharply, to teach me more respect afterwards, and not to aspire to things out of my reach: but that thought was soon sweetned by a feigned ignorance, that she under∣stood my discourse proceeded from the true af∣fection I already bare her. Thus you see how I took boldnesse betimes, to discover a thing unto her, which I did not understand: For how, at
thirteen years of age could I apprehend the my∣steries of one of the most powerfull Gods? In truth, I knew not yet, what Love was: but I knew that Lisimena was the sweetest object of mine eyes, and the sole thing in the world, which could please me. I knew well enough, that I ought not to love her, and that my inclination was extravagant, and rash: but when I thought to divert my self from it, a certain power recall'd me, which I could not chuse but yeeld to. Growing in age, I increased in affection, and my respect augmented in such sort, as I dared not stedfastly behold Lisimena, because the Love, which day by day, did kindle in my eyes, had without doubt discovered the passion, which my minde formed; and I feared to undo my self, by laying it open to her, as well by the losse of my fortune, as contentment, which had been quite taken from me, if I had been separated from her service. However, I could not so well conceal my self, nor keep in my inclination, but that somewhat at length appeared in my face; I lost by little and little, that gayety, which was so naturall unto me, I became melancholick and grave: in short, I dayly gave visible signes, of a growing affection, and respectful, which I one day took the boldness to let her see, that cans'd it, in such manner as I mean to tell you. I was retired all alone, into the Wardrope, where, having discovered by a chink of the door, that the Princesse came to observe what I did, feigning not to see her, I cast my self upon a bed,
and drew a Handkerchief out of my pocket to wipe my eyes, bedewed with tears; a fegining, which became the innocency of my age, and uttered these Words, so, as to be under∣stood. O divine Lisimena, why am not I permitted to adore you? and why hath Nature given me the courage to love you, not giving me conditions worthy to deserve a like of affection? But I, what am I, that presume to sigh for you? poor, and miserable Creature, a despicable, found Child, the refuse of the world, and Fortunes Shittlecock. Truly, tis a handsome thing, that should suffer my desires, to carry me so high, to make my fall the more shamefull; it becomes me well, to look amorously on her, whom the greatest Princes behold with respect, and who, by the force of her beauty is able to bring down the greatest courages of Asia Die yee incon siderate thoughts, yee are so faulty, as but for letting yee take place in my soul, I do confesse I have deserved death. When I had ended those words, with a deep sigh, drawn from the bottom of my hear, I heard a noyse at the door, and instantly rising, I perceiv'd it was that divine Princesse, who ha∣ving been on her knees, to consider me the bet∣ter, and when she found her self surpriz'd by any discourse, meaning to steal softly away, she could not do it so quietly, but that her knee in rising knock against the door: that noise made her double her pace, and she fled as fast as she could into her Closet, for fear, left I should take notice of the curiosity she had had, to see and hear my discourse.
That flight of hers, put me at first into a great fear; for I thought she had gone to declare my childish passion to the Queen, and make sport of it, through the Corut: however, she said no∣thing, and in truth, her discreet concealing it, is the only note that I think I ever had of her good will to me, which never the lesse, proceed∣ed but from her perfect judgment. Since that time, she hath been more grave to me, and hath not talk'd so often with me, as she was wont, but I have lov'd her still; and flat∣tered, by I know not what hope, because she had not disocvered me, I would not see my condem∣nation in her silence. I therefore persisted, and to make my self worthy of the high resolution I had taken, I began to be touched with honour, and to look upon the deeds of those who were of greatest credit in Court, that I might get re∣putation by their example. The thing which facilitated my means of ar∣riving to the glory I pretended, was, that after the Queens death, who loved me, and was my only support, finding my self used with lesse fa∣vour by the chief of her houshold than I had been while she lived, and my little courage obliging me to put my self forward, by how much more I found they neglected me; A certain young Gen∣tleman, one of the Princesses Governesses sons, who had a mind to anger me, and us'd to soff at me, could not upon a day endure the high answers I gave his flouts. After I had a good while suffered, at last I lost my patience, in so much as I could not chuse but answer him sharp∣ly,
whereat he growing very angry, Thou art too saucy (said he) in a tone more grave, and serious, and I will teach thee to know thy duty, not to make comparisons; thou mistakest thy self too much, and so as thou hast forgot thy own name: For thou shouldst call to mind (Euribel∣dus) that thou art but a found child; Tis tr reply'd I briskly to him, but whatso cre I am, re∣member thou, that I am able to lose thee; and so wholly, as never more to be found alive: And with these words, I drew my sword, and made him do the like; he came couragiously towards me; but though he had two years advantage more than I, I had so good fortune, as to reverge the injury he did me by his death. As soon as saw him fallen, I put all my surety in my heels, and saved my self in my first Master Arbirans house, who with open arms receiv'd me. This valiant Knight, and the greatest of the whole Kingdom, had still kept the good will he bare me even from my infancy: in somuch, as when he had heard my reasons which he found just, he kept me a while private, until he had justified me to the King, of whom, in spite of the mother, and friends of the dead, which were of quality, he obtain'd my pardon. In ac∣knowledgment of this good turn, I ever after was so observant of him, and shewed so great a zeal, and affection to his service, as I can truly say, he loved me before any of his kindred, and made me so considerable in the Court, by the honor of that friendship, which all people took notice of, that I was respected of both sexes; for Arbiran,
was no lesse loved of the Ladies for his extream civility, than by men honor'd for his exeeding valour. But truly all these honors were indiffer∣ent to me, in the only consideration I had to be acceptable unto Lisimena: That fair Princesse nourish'd still within me the servant desires which consumed me, and by so much the more entertain'd me in my amorous disquier, by how much my respect depriv'd me of the means of seeing her, for fear of offering an unwellcome and sad object to her Governesse eyes, who could not forget the death of her son: if sometimes I met her in the Palace, I saluted her a far off with certain gestures, which equally witnessed my passion to serve her, and my fear to discontent her, and that beauty, who had still the signs of my foolish passion fresh in her memory, look'd o∣ver from me, whether out of scorn or judgment I cannot tell. Forgive me (Sir) if I busie my self in telling you a thousand needlesse circumstances, but most pleasing to my remembrance, which are nothing to our matter, but contrary, do set me off from the design, I had to tell you the fust and princi∣pal cause which so absolutely gome the King of Zeylans favour. That Prince, who is exceeding pious, and al∣waies delighted in serving the gods, according to the custom of his Country, and devotion of his fathers, having understood that that new sect of Mathometans, was lately slid into his Island, which is the fairest and fruidfullest of all the Inde, desirous to banish that strange religion,
which was able to undo his Subjects, and to dis∣unite them from their lawful obedience unto him; he made an Edict, by which he proclai∣med guilty of high Treason to his, & the Divine Majesty, all those that should be convicted of ad∣hering to those new opinions, and as such, he ordained, that their goods should be consiscate, and banished within a months space out of his Country. There were a number of those Infidels dwel∣ling in the Port Tanadarus, who as soon as they heard a breath of this Ordinance, seizd on the Castle, which is one of the best in the Kingdom, and expecting that they should be assulted, de∣puted three or four of them, to go speedily to the King of the Maldives, to seek his aid, seeing he was of their Law, and had embraced the sam: unhappy belief which they had done. This King of the Maldives, who was Lord but of several pieces of land, seperated by arms of the Sea, and envious of the King of Zylans prosperi∣ty, was very glad of so fair an occasion offered, to enter upon his Countries, so convenient for him; And that he might not want pretext, not be unprovided to answer the blame, which his nghbours might lay on him, he dispatch'd an Embassidor to the King of Zeylan, by whom be prayed him, to use his Subjects with more faver, and to permit them the liberty of their religion in his Island; if otherwise, he should be obliged to protect them, as his brethren, united with him in belief, toward the god he worshiped, according to the Divine Laws of Mahomor, his great Pro∣phet.
The King of Zeyland, gave a generous answer to that Embassador; that he very much wondred at his Masters extravagancy and rashnesse, who Impertinently thrust himself into the knowledge of his Subjects affairs; that, if his threat did stir him unto any thing, it should be, to a greater ri∣gor towards those, who without any good ground, had miserably forsaken their fathers gods: and for his own particular, he should in∣stantly depart out of his Countries, lest his anger might make him violate the Laws of Nations, and in his person, punish his Masters insolence, whom he would prevent. That Embassador who look'd not at all, for so rough an answer, so exasperated the King his Masters courage, which was enough irritated before, that he immediate∣ly sent forth a hundred Ships and more from the Port of the Maldives, to go succour the Re∣bels of Tanadarus. In the mean time, as the Sectaries of that cur∣sed law, think they cannot do God better ser∣vice, nor finde a shorter way to heaven, than by murthering those that oppose their belief, they plotted a furious conjuration against the Kings person; twelve of the most resolute of his Rebel Subjects drink each others blood, to encourage themselves, and take a firm resolution to go kill the King in his Palace Hal, and in the middle of his Guards. This open and generous Prince, who till that time had arm'd himself with no defence, gave liberty to all sort of people as accustomed, to be in his Palace, where, four of the conspira∣tors
entred, without notice taken of them, and as the formost of them lift his arm to strike the King, it was my happy fortune, only of the com∣pany, to perceive him: for that Traytor, not at all troubled at his damnable design, had so well taken his time, that if the Tutelary gods of Zey∣lan, had not directed my cies unto him, undoub∣tedly the King had died. As soon then, as I spi∣ed the action and motion of that perfidious mur∣therers arm, I threw my self at all hazard betwixt  and the King, and taking his hand, to put by the blow, which slightly hurt me in the face, hold Traytor said I to him, and fearing lest he might redouble it, I took him by the coller. The King who saw my check bloody, and with what rage I opposed that Ruffin, whose design be know not, ask'd what was the matter: Ah, (Sir) said I, doubtlesse some great Treason plot∣ted against your Majesty: then by and by he saw the Dagger, which the murcherer had let fall, he was instantly set on the Pack, where he confess'd he number of the parties sworn, who were found out, and quartered alive, as well as himself. The King was so much pleas'd with me for this action, as he embrac'd me before them all, and praising what I had done to save him; I swear said he, Euribaldus, that I will not be un∣thankful for the service you have done me, but posterity shall know thou hast oblig'd a thank∣ful Prince: wherefore dispatch, and ask me any thing in my power, and I protest to thee again by the tutelary gods of this Kingdom, it shall be∣granted
thee of whatsoever price it be. I, being dazled by so great a sev, made him this answer on my knee, which  than what had past, oblig'd his love of me. It is your on∣ly noblenesse, Sir, which makes the sinall service I was obliged to do you, acceptable, although at hazard of my life: the gods forbid, that I should ever pretend to deserve an acknowledg∣ment from you, for what my duty bound me to, and for a thing I ought my self; tis only Fortune whom you are to thank, for having happily ad∣drest mine eyes, unto the murtherer, to turn his stroak, and I a ssure my self, there is not any Sub∣ject you have, but would have shewn the same zeal to save you, admitting him the same good fortune. The King seeing how gracefully I refused the good he offered me; Observe truly, said he, tur∣ning towards Arbiran, a great deal of youth, ac∣companied with a great deal of vertue, and I in∣tend not that this service shall be unrewarded. Say then, Euribaldus, what thou askest of me, I protest to take thy silence as a scorn, if thou crave nothing of me. When I saw my self thus put to it: Great Prince, answered I, I should be wholly ignorant, if I did not acknowledge the graity which your Majesty offers me, to proceed from your a∣lone goodnesse, and I should injuce heaven, which hath caused me favour in your sight, if I should not obey your commands, and ish your No∣blenesse with some occasion. That then (Sir) which I crave of you is, that it will please your
Majesty to take from me, my former name given me, which seems to reproach me ever with the shame of my birth, me I say, who prefer honor before all other advantages of Fortune; Since you desire to raise me, first take me from that po∣verty which Nature seems to have plac'd me in, and you will give me a great deal, if you but cou∣rage me a little. Truly answer'd he, thy request is too noble, and too just to be refused, I know not who thy parents are, but who so ere thou art, I see that Nature hath not been so much a step∣dam to thee as thou thinkst, being so vertuously dispos'd. From this time, I declare thee a Gen∣tleman; and seeing that Gentility is a quality depending on another, and which may happen to thy contrary, I mean a vicious man, and of no worth; be it known, in case thy birth be mean, that I account it far below the quality thy vertue gives thee. And, that henceforth, thy name may not be only in the esteem, but reverence of my Subjects, my only daughter shall name thee, and being bred her Page, thou shalt henceforth be her Knight. Presently, he commanded me to follow him to the Princesse Chamber, who by the Kings command, gave me the sweet name of Lisimantus, which ever since I have enjoyed, and did me the honor to girt on my sword, which I have ever since imployed in that Kingdoms service. The fair Princesse was a little surprized when the King commanded her that thing; for in∣stantly she thought upon my love, and though no creature know there of but herself, she could not
chuse but blush, finding she was oblig'd to shew me so much favour: but verily my sense was ve∣ry different from hers, and if I had not sum∣mon'd all my force to help me in that mansport, I had given apparent signs of my passion to the whole Court. I resisted (in truth) my first motions of joy, with a great deal of constancy, as well, when she gave me her fair name, as when she girded on my sword: but, when according to the order of their ceremonies, I was commanded to kisse her fair hand naked, which had done me so much honor, and that Love had emboldned me to kisse that beautious living Marble; I confesse that all my senses were troubled, and yet for the present I so contain'd my self, as she alone, could take no∣tice of my rapture. Since that happy day, I had more liberty of seeing her and speaking with her, as one who was her creature and Knight, made with her own hand, could every day go seek imployment of her: but foreseeing that the service I would do her, was not what she desired of me, I oftentimes constrain'd the violence of my desires, and fear∣ful to displease her, did forbear to wait on her. In the meanwhile, the King caused ten thou∣sand men to depart in all diligence to punish the Rebels of Tanadarus, who in such sort had in∣compassed those in the Castle whom they had surpriz'd; as had it not been for the succour which the King of Maldives sent them, they had been already reduced to extremity, for want of
having provided what was necessary to sustain a Siege, and were even ready to ask mercy. But, when they discover'd the Ships which brought them aid, they recovered new forces, and set up, on their walls, the King of Maldives arms and Standards, to shew, that they gave themselves to him, and acknowledg'd him their Prince. He that commanded that Fleet, was a Turk, renowned for his valour, and called Ibraim, who to get glory in that occasion, and to witnesse his passion to serve very well his religion, and new Master, (to whom he had given himself,) caus'd all his Troops to land in the fury of the tide at a place of the Island where they were not expected, very neer to Tanadarus; Although the approach were difficult enough, he boldly freed the passage, wherein some of his people were drowned, and came with eight thousand men well arm'd with purpose to raise the Siege; which succeeded to him, to our prejudice; for our men were fain to expect him in open field, and give him Bat∣tel, where he was so happy, as to remain Victor; he presently cast into that place, which was ex∣cellent, the Victuals, and Ammunitions, he had brought in his Ship, and so refreshed the besieg∣ed, that in a whole years space they could not be taken by famine. Being made proud with this victory, he sorti∣fied himself in the City, expecting a second fleet, which arived, greater than the first: in so much, as this ill news comming to us, the King was constrain'd to send Arbiran with new troops, who would have me accompany him in that en∣terprise,
and share in the glory, which he hop'd for, with him. Before my departure, I went to take leave of the King, who shewed me already a great deal of friendship, and seeing with what cheerfulness, I undertook that voyage, said alond, that he had conceived great hopes of me, which so inflam'd my Courage, as I fear'd, it would not finde enough to be imployed on. When I had received his commands, I went to the Prin∣cesse side, before whom, upon my Knee, I said, Madam, being oblig'd to give you an account of all my actions, as your Knight, I am come to crave your leave, that I may serve the King your Father, at Tanadarus, under the valiant Arbiran, and there endeavor to do something, which may make me worthy of the honor I have received from your Royall hands, and that you may be lesse sorry for the extraordinary favor you have done me. My Knight answered she, with somewhat more confidence, than ordinary, I shallnever re∣pent the doing of a just action, and whereto I have been invited by his command, who hath all power upon me, and who cannot sufficiently recompence the affection, which you have had, to his service; Continue in well doing, and I am confident, you shall hereafter reap other fruits of his love; He may Madam, reply'd I, make me as great as he please, but though he should divide his very Crown with me, and give me equall power over his Subjects with himself, do you think, I should hold me more obliged to him for that favor, than for that he hath already done me, in consenting to the great honor I
have received from you? Since you have made me what I am, and that I have the glorious, ad∣vantage, of being called after the greatest beauty of the world; assure your self, great Princesse, that I will cause discourse of me henceforward, and if death prevent not my ambition, the illustri∣ous name you have bestowed on me, shall travel far beyond the limits of this Kingdom. I had engaged my self much farther in my Comple∣ments, if I had not considered, that they al∣ready exceeded the bounds of respect, which a subject ought his Princesse, wherefore thinking it enough what I had said, and inclining my self very low to kisse the hem of her garment, she did me the honor to offer me her hand, which caused me to return, full of ardent desire of glory to Ar∣biran, whom I found ready to depart, and whom, with open signs of joy I followed. I then entred the eighteenth year of my age, and was grown to such a strength and advantagi∣ous stature, that I could desie the strongest, at wrastling, and had so well bestowed my time with Arbiran, after I had left being Page, as that my skill was more commended, than my strength. Besides, Lisimena had so many charmes, and all her features so well form'd, that she ra∣visht all men with her beauty, which I dare not embolden my self to describe, lest I may not be able to do it sufficiently: The ambition I had to do something, that might come to her ears, was so sharp a spur unto me, as being at hand blows with our enemies, whom we went to force, even in their own Trenches, my good fortune would,
that I had to do with their Chief, the valiant I∣braim, who till that time, had so fortunately gui∣ded so great an enterprize. Him then I chose a∣mong the rest, finding him doubly notable, as well for his aspect, as horrible slaughter he made among our people; and after having some space resisted the fury of his arm, in the end made him sink by a blow of my sword. I very happily dis∣engaged my self from the Troops which had en∣compassed me, who seeing him fallen, lost their courage, and rather sought to succour, than re∣venge him; yet I was Iustily assaulted by five or fix of his guard, with whom I fought stoutly, and had they been seconded, I had been un∣doubtedly loft, by being too far engaged in the throng. Arbiran on his side, had done his part so well, being assisted by divers Gentlemen voluntiers, who did indeed wonders in that occasion, that he put the rest of our enemies to flight; and when he saw me return, cover'd with blood, and sweat and dust, with the restimony of what I had been seen to do, and how I had with my own hand slain the chief of the Maldives; he gave me great commendation, and did me the honor to write more good of me to the King than he had seen: I confesse to you Sir, that little action gave me great estimation, and from that instant I was thought fit to command a chosen Company of Souldiers, who had loft their chief in that Battel, and which I afterward led on many hot occasi∣ons. As soon as we had routed the enemies Army,
we had order from the King to return to the siege of Tanadarus, and to take that place whatsoever it cost. But I abuse your patience by telling you particulars of those things, whereof all Asia is insorm'd, and which your self should know as well as those who did them. Hereat the King of Cambaya expressed to him, that he should be very glad from his mouth to learn the very parti∣culars of the fortune he had run in those Wars, which had so long lasted between the two enemies Kings; Whom Lisimantus obeyed, and made him a summary discourse thereof in these words following. After we had taken that City, whose Siege lasted ten whole months, and that we had forc'd it at our enemies nose, who were come with the unprofitable power of an hundred other sails, to succour it, the King gave me the government thereof: Notwithstanding I rested not long there, because I was thought useful elsewhere, and that the brave Arbiran, who was Admiral of Zeylan, did me the honor to make me his Lieutenant to repel that Enemies Fleet, which since the taking of Tanadarus, had never ceased pillaging our ships returning from Narsinga, and ransacking whatsoever call'd it self ours. The King of Nar∣singa brother in law to our King, and his especi∣al friend, believing that we were not strong e∣nough to resist the King of Maldives power by sea, sent us of his own accord, a hundred sail, to strengthen our Fleet, wherewith we went to pre∣sent Battel to our enemies, who at that time had not the heart to meet us: but six months after, re∣turning
stronger than at that time, and we ha∣ving notice of them, although of lesse number, were so bold as to assault them, and the Fight continuing untill night, the advantage remained on both fides, equal; and had the wind been as favorable unto as as to them, without doubt, the Victory had been clearly ours. The next morning, when we thought to recompence the Fight, there rose so furious a tempest, the winde at Southwest, as spoil'd our whole designs, and whether we would or no, were constrain'd to yield to the violence of the storme, which dis∣pers'd a part of our Fleet, and drave the Admi∣ral wherein we were, into the Road of Commory, at the point of Narsigna. The valiant Arbiran, impatient that he could not revenge as yet the injuries which those bar∣barous Maldives had so many times done us, ob∣tained of the King, that he might land upon one of their Islands, to endammage them to purpose, and do them the affront, with which they had but threatned us. The King having approved this design, we were eight months on sitting our selves, that we might not fail of our purpose; during which time, I remained at the Court, and favored by the sight, and entertainment of my divine Princesse, who touched with that little reputation, which I had gotten in those last stirs, did so much the rather force her inclination to endure me, that she look'd respectfully on me, and because she thought, that age which had ac∣quir'd me more knowledge, had diverted me from that disordered meaning, which I had in
my infancy, to serve her as a Lover. But alas, that liberty she gave me, was the cause of all my ruin, for as it is the custom of Lovers to flatter themselves in their passions, I made my self be∣lieve, that the good acceptation she began to give me, was a testimony of her affection, and so blin∣ded my self in my love, as I took her civility for an argument of good liking. Being deceived with this foolish belief, I proceeded farther, than before, even to embrace her with mine eyes, and to give her certain proofs by all my actions, that my flame was augmented. This obliged her to resume her former severity, and to live so recluse unto me, that I am forc'd to say to my consusion, that since that day, she never saw me but with trouble; Ny I was so unhappy, that fearing lest I would take leave of her, the day of my depar∣ture, she said she was sick, and kept herself un∣seen by any. I lost not however my courage, although the better part of my amorous hopes; and followed Arbiran as resolutely, as if I had departed with a favor from Lisimena, so powerful in my soul, was the defire of glory, where ambition reign'd with Love. Our design succeeded happily, we forc'd the place we attempted, which was the most important of all Atollon in the Province of Padipol: but the poor Arbiran was slain, when he had don a thousand memorable exploits of valour. This our irreparable losse, was so felt by all the Army, and in such sort troubled it, not knowing where to go for counsel, and not daring yet to trust its conduct to my youth, although I
were Lieutenant to the Admiral, that we retur∣ned without doing any thing, and without so much as leaving a Garison in the place we had taken. I bare with great impatience (truly) the sor∣row of that losse, and at my return, I had the honor to be comforted by the Kings own mouth, who better than any other, knew the cause I had to be afflicted. But alas, it was not from him I look'd for the healthful remedies of my sensible griefs, one only word from Lisimenaes mouth, had comforted me not only for the losse of my friend, but also of my heart, in serving her, and of all the troubles I endured for her. But I was very far from the hope of that favor, she shun'd me more than before, and her scorns, which I could not endure, by little and little choack'd the respect which remained for her in my soul. As though nature had made me sensible of what I was, I thought in my self, that I deserved a milder usage, and if not as a Lover, yet in the quality of Lisimenaes Knight I deserv'd, a freer accesse unto her than she gave me. I could not conceal my displeasure, but gave my passion so much consi∣dence, as it came to the Kings cars, as I have since known, who feigned to know nothing, be∣cause I was so necessary for his service; howe∣ver he feared lest that affection might take too deep root in my heart, and besides the extrava∣gance which I might shew to all the Court, I might do him ill service, and make my self un∣worthy to command his Armies, if I should lose the Mastery of my self. He therefore removed
from my sight that divine object, upon a pre∣tence, favorable enough to his distrust; for as af∣ter Arbirans death I had very ill handled the Maldives in two, or three rancounters, who were put to sea, to repair their losses, and former out∣rager, they resolved to make one final attempt, and having shut up all their Ports, lest news might be brought us of their design, they prepa∣red a great and mighty Fleet to powre on us; but they could not work so privately, but that a Spie came to advertise us, of their enterpriz, and assur'd us, that all that great preparation, was for the City of Collombo, which these Barba∣rians had a purpose to besiege by Sea and Land. The King, who commonly aboad in that Ca∣pital City of his Kingdom, thought not his daughter which was his most precious jewel, in too great a surety there; insomuch, as for deli∣vering her from my troublesome sute, and to se∣cure her from the enemies in vasion, whose threat∣nings he thought not i to scorn, he sent her to her Unkle, the King of Narsinga, to accompany her fair Cousin Orazia, untill the troubles of Zeylan were over. Judge Sir, by what I have told you of my Love, if this seperation must be grievous to me; however, I must bear it, and constrain my self in the Kings sight, who observ'd me more than he was wont, to see if my spirit were chang'd, or whether I had rigor enough to digest that trouble without distraction. I was indeed, very happy in my constancy, to resist my resentment in that occasion, where it may be, any other,
than my self might have suffered himself to be o∣vercome; for the King who had a very good o∣pinion of my courage, believing I had quire for∣gotten that passion, which kindled in my heart by Listmenaes presence only, did me the honor, with the general consent of the whole Army, to make me heir of all Arbirans command. As soon as I found the whole force of the Kingdom in my hands, a new desire of glory en∣tred my heart, and seeing that our enemies were slow in comming to us, and that they could not be a long time ready, I perswaded the King to give way that I might go and assault them in the Isle of Bandos, neer the City of Male, where I had intelligence. What more shall I say? all succeeded happily unto me, as you have known from others, and in spire of all the King of Mal∣dives strength, who came with a powerful Army to hinder my design, I took the Cstle of Bandos, which was of greatest importance of all, for keeping of his thirteen Provinces, or Atollous, whereof, I became master within the spar of eighteen months, and having defeated himself with all his power, I compelled him to s, into the remotest parts of the Island of Palandurus. I had pursued him even there, but that I pirried the misery of that poor Prince, who wanted no courage, and who intruth would have done things worthy of his birth, if fortune had but se∣conded his ambition. I contented my self them, to have augmented the King of Zeylans possessions by the whole ex∣tent of the Kingdom of the Maldives; where
when I had left good Garisons, I returned Victo∣rious to Tanadarus, honored by the King; and reverenc'd by all his Subjects, who could not but admire at my prosperities, and who imputed to me only, that particular favour of the heavens to accomplish all my enterprizes. Scarce had I the refreshment there of one whole month; for we being advertised that Ro∣zalcan and Zabain, who to make themselves Lords of the Kingdom of Decan, by a cruel, and tyrannous usurpation had again dared to assault the King of Narfinga, from whom, we had had so great aids in all our Wars and necessities; The King without expecting his defire of succours from him; sent back all his Troops, which had assisted him in the Conquest of the Maldives, and having added half so many of the best Souldiers in his Army unto them, which he must else have dismissed, he commanded me to lead them, and present them to his brother in law, and that I should receive directions from him of what we had to do for his service. It would be needlesse for me to tell you, what I did, after I had the honor done me to have the Command of the Ar∣my divided between the Prince Arontus, and my self, and after what manner I regain'd the Coun∣try of Canara, which had been usurped from the King of Narsinga: I know, Sir, that you can speak of all those matters, as well as they that did them, and that nothing since the death of Aron∣tus hath passed whereof you have not had very faithful relations. Wherefore I will return a∣gain to my Love, and tell you some particu∣lars
of that sad passion, which more than ever re∣newed in my soul, at the sight of Lisimena, whom I found in the Kingdom of Narsinga. But I know not how I shall yet remember that ungrate∣ful beauty, who hath alwaies been so cruel to me, and to oppresse me with misfortune, and disgrace, hath caus'd me to be jealous of my own blood, which a beastly anger hath enforced me to spill, that ever after I might remain miserable, and finde no where to comfort me in my displea∣sures. The poor Lisimantus, in uttering these words, could not restrain his tears, which ran aboun∣dnly from his eves, which so moved the King, as be seconded them with his; and as he was dis∣posing himself no continue the History of his misfortunce, and to tell the King what sad occa∣sion had so lightly moved him to seek his bro∣ther Anaxanders death, they heard a great noise at the door, and wondering who it should be, that was so bold to knock so loudly, they found it was Pirobus, who was returned from Narsinga. The good old man at his arrival hearing in how great trouble the King, and all the Court were, for the imaginary death of Anaxander, made all baste to them, and to assure them of both the young Princes health, and that they would with∣in a few daies, return to Campanel. As soon as the King had heard this welcome news, he embraced Lisimantus with another manner of courage than he had done; and that the Queen might receive him kindly, he would have him to give her the first knowledge of what
she no more looked for, and that he who had made the wound, might bring the remedy him∣self. And because the Queen had not yet seen Li∣simantus face, the King commanded him to feign, that he was one of the King of Narsinga's Gen∣tlemen, who by command from his Master, was come to assure their Majesties, that Anaxander lived, and in health, and that not being perfectly healed of his hurts, lest they might be in fear for him, he was dispatched to deliver them from that disquiet. Lisimantus observed punctually that com∣mand, and when with a smiling countenance he entred the Queens chamber with that good news, she was ready to die for joy; thinking verily, that Lisimantus was an Embassador from the King of Narsinga, she undid two strings of fair and goodly orient Pearl from her neck, which she u∣sually wore, to give them him; the King entred as he received that Present, and asking the Queen if she had not all reason of the world to cherish and embrace him, who came to drive all sor∣sows from her heart, and had made so quick a passage of her mourning into joy? Sir, said she to him, being transported, I should be very un∣gratefull, if I loved him not as long as I live, see∣ing without the news he brings me, I had never been comforted. 'Tis, Madam, said the King, all that he desires, that you love him, and 'tis the onely request I have to make you in his behalf: I may now safely tell you, he is my Son, and that brave and generous Lisimantus, whom ere∣whiles you so mortally hated, and who hated
himself yet more, in the sorrow he conceived, believing he had slain a Brother he knew not, and whose courage he admired. Love him, Ma∣dam, I conjure you, and forgive his quarrell with Anaxander, since he is so penitent, and wil∣ling to repair that fault by a thousand testimonies of friendship, which he promiseth to give him hereafter, as his onely Brother, whom onely likewise he will love. The vertuous Anaxarette, seeing with what affection the King intreated her to a thing, where∣to the good looks, and news of Lisimantus had already inclined her: Yes truly, said she, I will love him as much for the consideration of his own merit, as for that you wish it: and that you may have testimony, that henceforward I desire to account him my Son, I will give him a Mothers kiss; which said, she embraced him be∣fore the King, who shed tears for joy. By and by Pirobus was called, whom the King made repeat to the Queen all that Piroxenus had said to him of Anaxander, and how they hoped shortly to come and rejoyce with their Majesties, and make them laugh in good canest at the King of Nar∣singa's anger, who know them not, and who pur∣sued them as violaters of his Edict. After the confirmation of this common joy, they all went to the Temple to give the gods thanks; the Court was presently full again of pleasure, and the Cam∣baians thought of no one thing but doing him honour, whom but so lately they were resolved to put to a shamefull death; They talked of no∣thing now but Gallantry, Balls, and Turnamens,
after the Arabick manner, which was however nothing to what they prepared for the return of the two young Princes, whom they had so much lamented. Lisimantus received a double cause of consola∣tion, when he understood by Pirobus all Anax∣ander's History, and that he pretended onely to Orazia; a thousand times he condemned his rashness, that had not patience to clear a truth, which respected his dear Lisimena's honour, as well as his own interests. The valiant Zenobus, who had shared in his displeasures, found him∣self at that present partaker of his good fortune; he had a world of fair Presents from the King, accompanied with as many assurances, that he should have at all times what part he pleased of his childrens fortunes. That which redoubled the pleasure of all the Court, and was subject of much sport, was the wise faces which Eurimedes his Son made; that false Alcidaris, seeing himself left of every body, at the first news of Lisimantus's being Heir of the Crown of Cambaya, fell a crying like a child, and roaring in the streets, so unfortunate, as to make them laugh, whom he thought to make pity him by his tears. In this fashion he came to the Hall, where the Ball was to be danced, and ap∣plying himself to the King, Sir, said he to him, is it true that I am no longer your son? I swear to you every body comes and tells me so, and all my Servants have left me, as if I were some scoun∣drel or poor fellow; I pray cause the insolence of that rabble which you made of my Train, to
be punished, they mock me before my nose, like a Drunkard, and have let me come hither alone, and am fain to carry my sword my self; I do not think, Sir, that you have bid them use ne so. What think you my friend, answered the King, shew∣ing him Lisimantus, do you not believe this man hath a better look for a Prince than you, and de∣serveth rather to be acknowledged for my Son? Ah Sir, replied the Innocent, some Impostor doubtless hath delivered him you to keep. I feel plainly that I am your lawfull son, if not, you would not have sent an Embassador to the King of Narsinga, to crave his onely Daughter in mar∣riage for me; it may be this may be one of your Bastards; though his Mustacho be very well set up, I do not think that your Subjects will ac∣knowledge him to my prejudice, being not so well bred as I. Lisimantus, who knew the whole story of this false Alcidaris, and all his rudenes∣ses, could not forbear laughing at his words; and because he laught heartily at it, all the com∣pany seconded him, that the poor for knew it was in earnest they mockt him, and that they re∣strained not themselves, as when he was taken for the Prince and Heir of Gozarate. Admire the weaknesse & inconstancy of men, it was not two bours before, that this young man was ado∣red of all the People, and followed of the whole Court; and however extravagant he were, on the belief men had, that he was born a Prince, they honoured him as a god, although they knew he was a shame and reproach to the Kingdom; and behold, in one hour, Fortune overturning in
him what soever was thought she had establih'd everlastingly; every body leaves him, and that supposed rank which they feared; and disguis'd their faces with a feigned approbation of his fol∣lies, being known for counterfeit, they freely scoff'd at the poor wretch, who soon became the sport of the whole Court. The King however had some kinde of pitty on him, and truly, were it only but for that, this poor unhappy creature, had had the honor to carry the title of Prince, and to passe some years for the Kings only son, it was just, this that somewhat should be assur'd him during his life, which might take him out of that abject condition, where it to his rudenesse had east him again. The King then, finding that he was half in dispence concerning his greatnesse, resolv'd to put him wholly out of his errour, and to tell him how that supposal grew; But, said he, Eurimedes, for you must retain that name henceforth, which is you fathers; because I will be known to be kinde, and charitable, and that I will nor forsake, what I have once set in honor, and credit; Ask me any title, or other thing which may be fit for you, in my Kingdom, and you shall gladly have it. Every man expected, he should have craved some high condition, where profit might be joyn'd with honor: but he deceiv'd the compa∣ny, when above all things, with a smiling coun∣tenance, and see ling nothing at all of his past sor∣row, he desired he might have that poor wench of the Town whom he had in times past so well li∣ked;
The great Aleidarts, could not abstain from laughing, and turning him towards the Queen and Lisimantus: Truly, said he, Nature doth, what she doth, very well, giving ordinarily mean thoughts to low souls, as noble hearts, she maketh capable of glory and of high desires. Yes, said he, Eurimedes, take her; but, when thou are married to her, upon what wilt thou live? for I believe my son will not let thee enjoy his reve∣nue, nor those other things, which thou usur∣pedst from him. Hereat, the poor blockhead lost his joy again, and not knowing what to an∣swer; the King assur'd him of a good Pension, and his father, for his faithfulness a better; and the better to please the whole Court, which could not enough honor his dear Lisimantus, he sent one of his guard to fetch the Maid, and all her friends, and presently gave her to Eurimedes, who as easily forgot all his greatnesses, as if he never had possessed them, and bounded all his glory and ambition, with the possession of that woman his equal. Lisimantus, was yet very pale, as well by rea∣son of the wounds he had received from his bro∣thers hand, as for the little rest he had had in that dark prison, where the Cambaians fury had some daies detained him: yet was he a subject of all the Ladies admiration of the Court, who sin∣ding him as exquisite in spirit, as shape, could no less praise his courtesie, than countenance; and blessed heaven, that truth was manifest to their advantage, and that they were to live under so fine, and gallant a Prince. But although he was
as kinde to them all, as civility, and good man∣ners permitted him, his mind forbare not to wan∣der other where, and the sight of so many beau∣ties served, but to awake more fervently the re∣membrance of his dear Lisimena; As soon as he knew himself a Prince, that adorable beauty, was the first object which came into his thoughts, and presently apprehended, that inequality would be no longer an obstacle to his Love. If he were joyed at that quality, and if his heart were touched to the quick, it was only because it pro∣mis'd him a freer accesse to Lisimena; for other∣wise, he was too generous, to prize that present of Fortune, and be proud of it; he knew his cou∣rage was above the highest Thrones, and that he had enough wherewithall to obtain those Crowns and greatnesses, which his birth might have denyed him: He found he had a Princes soul, and illustrious blood was the least matter he accounted of, in such as governed with equi∣ty, and who by sweetness rather than Tyranny made themselves more absolute in their Domini∣on. The King his father, could not enough admire his actions; whenever he remembred his past Vi∣ctories, and thought upon the glory which his young son Anaxander had gotten, and the cou∣rage they both had to meet so many encounters, and dangerous occasions, he could not chuse but thank the gods, and flatter himself with that sweet vanity, that he was the happiest father, and most redoubted King of all Asia, in such chil∣dren.
His Physicians very provident for their new Princes health, fearing lest after so ill usage, and so little rest as he had had in eight or ten daies misery, before his felicity, he might fall sick, de∣sired his Majesty to perswade him to keep his bed a while, that they might purge him of the evill humours, which might have grown in him: But, it being by the King proposed to Lisimantus; Sir, said be, if you will set my mind at rest, and purge it of all melancholy that troubles it, I con∣jure you in the name of the gods, whom you worship, to send instantly an Embassadour to the King of Zeylan. When you shall have assured him that I have the honor to be acknowledged your son, I know he will nor deny me his daugh∣ter, which is the only content of my soul, and thing in the world which can make me happy. Son, said the King unto him, I have no other meaning than yours, and I am only sorry that you have prevented me, by your request; fo intended to propose it to you for your good. But, do not you desire to have your first name of Alcidaris restored to you, which you lost by so strange a fortune; me thinks, my Subjects will have greater cause of joy, when they shall see you inherit my name, as well as a good part of my Crown, and will thereby the better know you for their lawful Lord. Let them, Sir, re∣plyed Lisimantus, know me only, by the honor I have to be issued from you, and the actions I in∣tend to perform for their advantage, and suffer use to wear the brave name of Lisimantus, so so∣lemnly given me, by the fairest mouth of the
world, and being the first mark of credit which I got abroad; It may suffice if you think fit, that I write my self Alcidaris like you, and name my self Lisimantus. I promise you son, said the King, that I will never contradict what you think fit, do but desire; And to let you see, I am as impatient for your contentment as your self, I will presently go, and dispatch Albalor, Pirobus his eldest son, in Embassage, to the King of Zey∣lan, to crave the Princesse Lisimena in your name: if you will accompany my dispatch with a word of your own, make haste; for I already long, that you and your brother, were made happy in the possession of your Mistresses. And hereupon they parted, and Lisimantus ravish'd with con∣tent, that all things suited to his expectation, shut himself in his Closet, where he writ this letter to Lisimena. Lisimantus his letter to Lisimena. Madam, AT last, the gods have shewn me justice, and have furnish'd me, with what I may excuse the boldnesse you have heretofore blam'd in me, to seek your Love; if to de∣clare my self unto you, it be requisite to be a Kings son; you shall by this Embassadour, know, that Alcidaris, is my father; if for
brave actions it be needful to be recommen∣ded, you know what I have done for your Crowns safety; if to have reputation in the world, you must needs have been told of the renown, that there are but few Provinces, wherein I have not gotten worship for the name you gave me; if you desire a faith with. out example, I call to witnesse all the powers of heaven, and earth, that I have never lov'd but you, and if you do me now the honour to consent unto my just desire, you shall see, I have wherewith to blur the reputation and remembrance, of those antient loves propos'd as miracles in their examples. Because diligence was very requisite in this voy∣age, wch respected the contentment of the King in that of Lisimantus, Albalor a brave and accom∣plish'd Knight, and worthy son of so vertuous a father, made ready his equipage with all expedi∣tion, and taking with him fifty Gentlemen of the best born in the Court, shipped himself at Ba∣zaim, to reach the Island of Zeylan as soon as possibly he could. As soon as he was departed, the King thought now, on nothing more, than of his dear Anax∣anders return, whom he proposed already to see King of Norsinga, Bisnager, and Orixa, besides the Crown of that fair Kingdom of Dulcinda, which he was to have by his mothers side: That vertu∣ous Princesse had so recovered her former graces
and attractions, since the news of her sons life and health, as very few Lodies of that Kingdom exceeded her in beauty, such a property hath joy to dilate it self, and from the heart ascend into the face; All day she entertain'd her self with E∣vander, who on his part was to lesse ravish'd. And as she had a great power with the King, she caused great largesses to be distributed among the peo∣ple, which were accompanied with a thousand sports: yet was all that but little in comparison of the pomp and state, prepared for Lisimantus coming, wherein Anaxander and Piroxenus were to have a good share; their coming only was expected to celebrate it to the great contentment of their Majesties, and accomplishment of all E∣vanders joys, whom Lisimantus heartily forgave for that cruelty he was constrain'd to shew him, and whereto his just resentement drave him.
THE INDIAN HISTORY OF ANAXANDER AND OF ORAZIA. The sixth BOOK. THe whole Court and City were full of joy, and all the people of Cambaya forgetting their past grievances, fell to invent new Dances, and inviting one another to Feasts, as well for the contentment they received already by the sight of the of their Princes, as for the speedy return which they expected of the other; when Fortune, which pleaseth her self in a disorderly govern∣ment of the things of this world, and cannot en∣dore them long in one condition, cast the Cam∣bayans
again into a greater confusion, than they were ever in, and filled all the Court with fear, and disorder. During the time of the Ball, without thinking of any thing save being merry, as indeed there was no reason to suspect an evil, the King was a∣stonished to see the wise Almerin, Prince Anax∣anders faithful Squire comming towards him, out of breath, who at first throwing himself as his feet, Sir, if you make not haste to succour your son speedily, he will run the hazard of dying the most tragical death that ever was. Alas, had he listed to believe me, he had not been in this trou∣ble; for I did long ago conjure him to make himself known, and to remember the affront done him at Visaporus: but he was ever obstinate in his purpose, as likewise Piroxonus, to disguise themselves till now: in so much, as at present, they cannot be believed that they are of your blood, because they have been so long undisco∣ver'd to the King of Narsinga, who is about to punish them, as breakers of his Edict, having late∣ly fought a Duel within his Dominions. This news, did no lesse trouble the Company, than that which Pirobus had brought but lately had contented them; and that a present remedy might be given to that inconvenience, the King in great trouble, commanded Almerin, to tell him what new misfortune had befallen his Son, and what course might be taken to save his Life. Know (Sir, said the Past, who had scarce the leisure given him to draw his breath) that
after the Prince my Master had fought with Lisimantus, as Pirobus here come, may have told you, he concealed himself in a Castle belonging to Saradin, the Princess Orazias Squire, intending to return unto you, as soon as he recovered of his wounds, which were very grievous; and just as be was ready to do so, and depart with Piroxenus, who never left him out of his sight, he found an unexpected ambush layed for him. I doubt not but you have heard, how the Princess: Orazia, immediatly after that unhap∣py combat, thought fit to spread a noyse, that my Master was dead, that the King her Father incensed against him, as much as is possible, night have the lesse reason to send after him; The report of his death lasted for some dayes: but being impossible to keep any thing very secret in the Court, Saradin, who till that time had been very wise, could not chuse but reveal it at length unto a very intimate friend of his call'd Florestan, from whom he hid very few things, and told him for truth, that our Princes (but told him not, that they were so) were hid in his house, on the way to Baticalus, where the King had layn without knowing it. This Florestan, was in favour with a Lady of the Court, called Corisba, who was that Lerians Sister, whom anaxander had slain in Duell, at his first comming to the Court of Narsinga, being provoked by him, through his jealousie, that the Prince Arontus favoured him too much; and as it is the Custom of Lovers, to conceal nothing from their Mistresses, Florestan was so unworthy, as to re∣veal
his friends secret, unto his. This wicked woman finding a fair way to be revenged on him, who had slain her Brother, goes boldly to the King, tells him where our Masters were, and that at hazard of her life, he should finde them alive in Saradins Castle, where they laught at his au∣thority, and skorn'd the rigor of his laws. The King, who had been offended, and who kept his anger still in force, found it renew within him, by this unhappy notice; he by and by commanded an Officer to seize on Saradin, and to be answerable for him untill he had seen whether it were true which Corisba had told him, and to be throughly satisfied, he dispacht the Provost of Bisnagar, with a great many of the guard, to bring our Princes to him, either alive or dead, that however they came, they might serve as a memorable example to posteri∣ty, of his despis'd authority. Saradin, who pre∣sently found himself guilty of his little secresie, sound means to advertise the Princesse Orazia of this disorder, that she might seek to remedy it, and accused himself of having revealed the se∣cret to one, whom he accounted as his other self, not remembring that he kept his sister, whom A∣naxander had slain. The Princesse incontinent∣ly writ all she knew to my Master, and advis'd him, by her letter, that he should not stay till those of the guard came; that if he were in cas to save himself, he should do it speedily, how that she thought it not meet, that he should on that occasion declare himself what he was, for that he would run hazard not to be believed, and
that that would be a double cause of disgrace: that if he were so unhappy as to be ten by them, she should never be comforted, for that un∣awares she had let her Cosin Lasimena carry with her, the dead Prince Arontus his letter, which might happily have served to have verisied his birth, and that she wanted all other proof, if bra∣ven did not send them some one or other in that present, and dangerous necessity. The poor Princesse relyed on the Post for that road, but when her Post was ready to be gone, o horse could be gotten, for that the King had for∣hidden all men from being furnished. Mean time, the Provost went with all diligence, and the best Orazia could do, was to send a Foot-man which went excellent well, with promise of great reward if he came first to the Castle; The man was subtle, and crafty, but notwithstanding all his eare, in seeking by-waies, that those of the Guard might not see him, he came unto us but a half quarter of an hour before the others. Admire the extravagancy of Fare, and the ma∣lice of Fortune, we were ready the very next day to be gone from that place, the Prince my Master was perfectly well of his hurts, and we were in the pleasure of our approaching journey, when this messenger came to us: At first without com∣plement, he pressed us to be gone, because he as∣sur'd us, that those who sought our lives were not far from us. Anaxander had scarce read the Princesses letter to Piroxenus and me, when be∣hold the Castle beleagured with that rabble of Archers which in number were above two hun∣dred,
they so surprized us, as already twenty of them had gotten in by a little door of the outer Court, before we had perceiv'd them; we cry'd out to shut that door, and pull pu the draw-bridge, which was presently done by our people, and then presently we rushed upon those unfortu∣nate people which remained all on the place; A∣naxander nor Piroxenus gave one stroak in vain, they seem'd two angry Lions, which breathed nothing but revenge; and I may truly say they alone did that great execution: for eight or ten of us that we were of their people, besides my self, being but waiters and Grooms, lent them but little aid. Meanwhile, the rest kept loudly beat∣ing at the great gate of the base Court, saying that they came from the King, and that we must follow them. When we had dispatch'd the for∣wardest, we consulted what we had to do: and on the other side, those roagues, having heard the clashing of our swords, incensed by our resi∣stance, threatned to burn us if we came not forth, and yield our selves to them. The generous A∣naxander seeing us reduc'd to that extremity, he who never feared in danger, nor never drea∣ded the greatest threats of fortune, seeing we were to weak to resist that multitude of armed men, and that as it would be weaknesse in us to suffer our destruction, without resistance, so it would be rashnesse to set upon them, with so small a num∣ber as we were; He directed the little gate to be opened again, whereby they could not enter but two and two, which passage, we three would well enough maintain; and, should they be so
unwise as to hazard themselves, we might kill a good many of them, and by so many, lessen the number of our enemies. His opinion was pre∣sently put in execution; but when the first five or six came short, the rest retired; insomuch, as we shut the gate again, to see what the gods would counsel us; and truly in that eminent danger I was very sorry for Neanders absence, whom Piroxenus had sent to Orixa, for being a man skilful and valiant, he would by one means or another have been very helpful to us. We were by this time weary of slaughter, where we had so good fortune, as but one of ours were slain, and of us three Anaxander only had a light hurt in his shoulder; but indeed, the Princes behaved themselves so couragiously, that if they had had to do but with a score of them, I be∣lieve they would have made no more resistance to their fury than the former did. The Provost discerning that by force he could not so soon possess himself of us, in that Casile, by the advice of his companions, assembled the Peasants of the next Village, who being com∣manded to bring with them, store of straw, and dry fagots, they set fire to the gate of the base Court, and Stables belonging to the Castle, with intention to burn it, or compel us to come forth; when we perceived the fire to encrease towards us, we thought it better became us, to disput our lives couragiously, than die unworthily without any resistance: The Princes therefore took each a Lance which they found, and got upon two of the swiftest horses in the stables, purposing rather
to try to save, than to defend themselves; there being no Lance for me, I took my sword in my hand, and our people opening the gate as the Princes commanded them, which was already half consumed, we set spurs lively to our horses, and past through the flame, which was more fa∣vorable unto us than those that looked for us Anaxander who was best mounted would passe first, and flying like lightning, ran three or four of them through with his Lance, which in one body waited for us in the passage, and gave leave to Piroxenus and me to save our selves, but as our unhappy Prince thought himself free from those hangmens hands, ill fortune would that his horse astonish'd at the flame, which hurt his eyes in passing, fell with him in a ditch very neer his enemies: they instantly fell upon him, and being under his horse, we saw without being able to help him, how they took away his Lance and sword, and bound him with cords, as soon as they had disarm'd him. Piroxenus would have returned, but when I had put into his consideration, that at liberty he might be much better able to serve him, than if he exposed himself to bonds with him, he was for that time perswaded by me, and as I advised, he re∣solved to go in dispuise to Bisnagar, and try with the Princesse to save him whom he loved a thou∣sand times more than himself. As for me he commanded, that I should go advertise you of that misfortune with all speed, and in case they condemn'd not the Prince suddainly, without a∣ny form of processe, you might dispatch an Em∣bassador
to the King of Narsinga, time enough to save his life. And this, Sir, hath drawn me so hastily unto your Majesty; I protest unto you I have scarce eaten or drank since this fell out, for fear, the least stay night cause my Masters loss. They cannot have carryed him, (as he was bound) very fast, and am consident it is as much as they have been able to do, to bring him yester∣day to Bisnagar, for I gave whatever was ask'd me for fresh horses, where ever I could sinde them, and I believe never man made more dispatch. Here Almerin ended his discourse, which did not so much trouble the King, but that there re∣mained some hope for him: for knowing Orazi∣as love, he believed that fair Princesse would not fail to use all her credit, and power for him whom she was to marry: Besider, Paroxeaus his escape was another sign of comfort, persuming that he would finde friends in the Court to per∣swade the King not to precipitate his condemna∣tiō, that should declare himself so great a Prince, untill the truth were known; In the meanwhile not to lose time, he sent Falantus his Gentleman of the horse in all speed with such a direction as he instantly conceiv'd.
Alcidaris King of Cambaya, of Dul∣cinda, of Candahar, and Manda∣o, and absolute Lord of whatsoever that great renowned River waters which giveth name unto the Indes. To thee Salamas, mighty King of Narsinga, of Bisnagar, and of O∣rixus, and absolute Lord of the Seas, which furnish all the East with Pearl, his dear and well-belo∣ved brother, health. I Am informed, that my young son Anax∣ander, for whose death I have twice la∣mented, is the man, who hath so worthily served thee in thy Wars, under the name A∣riomant, and who of late, hath through his youthful heat first violated thy just Edicts; whereof I give thee speedy advertisement by Falantus Gentleman of my horse, and by this letter signed with my Hand, and Sealed with my Seal, that thou mayst turn thy anger from him, and use him as thy brothers son, in pow∣er, and equal in authority: I conjure thee moreover, to favor his sute, and give credit
to my Embassador, who will tell thee, that the man whom I designed for thy son in law, is worthy of thy kindred, and the fortune I had procur'd him, as my son. The King would added threats to the end of his letter, in case that some misfortune might have befallen poor Anaxander ere the comming of these, but he was disswaded by his counsel, who were of opinion, that in case nothing had yet hapned to the Princes disadvantage, threats might incense the King of Narsinga, and set him upon extremities, which his own inclinations might not move him to; wherefore they thought it sufficient, to have a great Army in readynesse, which Lisimantus should command, and should march great journeys, and be ready to powre on Narfinga, and revenge an affront which they yet but feared. The Queen upon this bare fear, encourag'd e∣very man to revenge; it was a pitty to see her in such trouble as that new discontent had cast hr into, more deep than ever. Like those, who have run great hazards at sea, and endure nothing with so great impatience, as shipwrack, threat∣ned at the Haven: That poor Princesse unfortu∣nate, who had so much already lamented her sons death, and been battered by so many storms, and crosses past, was never so sensible, as of this last torment, which assaulted her just when she thought her self under the shelter of all manner of afflictions, and misfortunes; she had already
flattered her self with sweet hope of embracing her son, she had invited the whole Court to honor his wellcome, she imagined that the tenderness of a mothers love, would not afford embraces e∣nough, to cherish so vertuous a child, when that sad messenger came and spoil'd her at an instant of those sweet meditations, to set her spirit on the rack, scarce pacifi'd with some small intervals of false joy. The King would willingly have seconded her in her just sorrow, and found matter of comfore for her, as he was wont, but the poor Prince had other things to think on; for though in some sort he expected that the King of Narsinga, would not proceed so fast; that point was too ticklish, to leave him without great cause of doubt, and he was wise enough to foresee, that to ground any hope upon the uncertain judgement of men, was but to build upon a moving sand. He therefore caused Lisimantus at the head of a hundred thousand men, to depart a few daies after Falantus had his dispatch. That young Knight was full of spirit, and exceedingly affecti∣onate to his Masters service; and seeing that his Princes safety, and the States quiet depended up∣on his diligence, he got upon the best and swift∣est horse in the Indes, and resolv'd to take him at far as his heart, and legs would carry him, before he would take Post: But, whiles he does his best, to come in good time to Bisnagar, let us make more haste there than he, and see what is done against Anaxander.
After that unfortunate Prince had been very hardly used on the way, by those men without pitty, w hose number he had so couragiously, and in vain diminished, he was conducted into that sad place, where once he expected to receive a more gentle entertainment; Piroxonus, who was ar∣riv'd but one day before him, had reaped no o∣ther fruit of his diligence, than lading the Prin∣cesse Orazia's spirit with affliction and sorrow, by recounting to her how Anaxander was taken, and pressing her to use all the means she could or his safety; but the poor Lady knew not to whom to adresse her self, and however violent passion she had to save her dear husband, her shame too much withheld her from declaring it to the King, whom she her self dared not to speak to, nor knew she whom else to trust, or chuse to do it in her stead. That which caus'd the misfortune and the ruin of our Princes, was their having lived with too much splendor and authority, during Arontus life, when they had held such rank, and kept such state, among the Courtiers of Narsinga, as they had got more jealousie, than friendship; One only, Saradin, had been able to have helped them, in that extremity, and seconded the Princesse good endeavour, if himself, for his innocent of∣sence, had not partaken with them. When the King came to know, that he was guilty of concealing the breakers of his Edict, he commanded him to be carried from his house where he was detayned, to the same prison where the unhappy Anaxander was shut up. All that
Piroxenus, with the Princesse, could do, was, to scatter a murmur through the Court, that he, whom they had used with so great in humanity, was the Prince Anaxander, Alcidaris the King of Cambayas Son, but very few were found that believed it, and the King himself who heard thereof, laught at it; because he had long time believed the common report, that he, with Pi∣roxenus, was slain, together with the two Princes of Decan, in that sally they made, during the siege of Visaporus, besides the assurance they had lately received from Pirobus his mouth, that the King of Cambaya had but one Son alive. That had not retarded his condemnation one minute, had there not hapned a contestation between the Ministers of Justice: The Grand Provost pre∣tended that he ought to give Judgement on him, because he had taken, and brought him by the Kings command; and on totheer side, because he had commanded in Armies, and till that time, done things, becomming a Gentleman, and a man of quality, The Chief Justice of the Naires disputed, that it belonged to him to make his processe, and spent two or three dayes in this debate, the one undoing, and disanulling, what the other commanded, insomuch, as the King was fain himself to regulate it. He was, then, of opinion, that seeing there had been certain of the guard slain by Ariomant, there was no reason, that their Chief should be both Judge and Party, and that it was reasonable that the Court of Nayres knew that it was a very easie matter to proceed against a man convicted, and that they
should hasten his Judgement, that he might quickly serve for an example. The Princesse had some small hope, that the King her Father would not so wholly yeeld him∣self up to his passions, but that he would cast an eye to the many services which her Anaxander had formerly done the dead Prince Arontus, as well as the Crown, under the name of Ariomant: besides, she hoped for some good, from the jour∣ney Almerin had made into Cambaya: but when she saw that the King hastned so very much the Judgement of the cause; and that purposely for that reason, he had sent to the Chief of the Judges; she thought he would run great haz∣ard, and that when it may be her Fathers nature might incline to Pitty and Compassion, he ight be too much engaged to this honour, and his word, not to give such example to his people. The greatest part of hte Judges, were very sorry for that poor offenders misfortune, and seeing when they came to give Judgement, that there was no liklihood of saving him, there was not one, but did it against his will, and with sor∣row condemned a man of so great merit; but the reverence of the Laws, and the honour they bare unto the Princes authority, oblig'd them, rather to save his Oaths, than him who had despis'd them; and seeing they must do Justice, they pronounced the sentencce of death against Anaxander, and condemned him, to have his Head struck off, in the great place before the Palace.
When this sad sentence was read unto him in the Prison, he was marvelously surpris'd; for beside, that he hoped for deliverance, by Pirex∣enus, and Almerin, and from the Princesse fa∣vour, he did not expect that the severity of the Laws would have extended to that last rigor, and thought, when they had only frighted him with punishment, they would have let him go. But when he saw it was in good earnest they con∣demned him to death: Friend, sayd he, to him that came as Deputy from the Court of Nayres, does the King know who I am, and that he hath no power of right over my life? Sir, Answered the Judge, there hath been a report spred here, that you are the King of Cambayas Son; but the King will not believe it, and himself told us, he had a thousand arguments to convince that falsehood; he ought at least, said Anaxander, to have known the truth, be∣fore he had thus precipitated my condemnation, and he should have found, that report very true: Remember my Friend, that this sentence passeth against himself and his own blood, because I am his Daughters husband, and if he be so barbarous, and unnatural, as to proceed farther to the exe∣cution of an unjust sentence, tell him, that besides the revenge I expect from heaven, he shall draw on his head, all the powers of the King my Fa∣ther, who will never indure, so foul an action, to escape unpunished. Is this the welcome that Strangers receive in this country, which come to do is honour? although I were not as I am, born a Prince, yet ought my person to be safe even
by the Law of Nations; your Laws cannot by right extend themselves beyond the limits of this Kingdom, nor punish crimes of honour, in those, whom you have not forbidden, and are not subject to the observation of your Lawes. Must I serve as an example, and be the first man chastis'd for an action, never yet by any man seen punish'd in Narsinga, though Ducls frequent in it, and Edicts chang'd a thousand times? Ah, pray bid the King he look more than once to what he does, and that a Kings Son ought not to be the first mark of his vengeance. Go to him presently, if you love his honour, and ask the Princesse, whether in disgrace she will abandon those, whom in Prosperity she hath made shew to love. The Judge was much astonished at his words, and thought himself oblig'd to tell them the King, wherefore he came knocking to the cham∣ber door, to acquaint him, w ith what he had learnt from Ariomant; but the Door keeper would not admit him, because the King was private with his Daughter, and had forbidden any whasoever, to be let in, till she were gone. That amorous Princesse, having known of Anaxanders condemnation, and seeing that all her vain hopes of his liberty, promised no good, overcome by her sorrow, and most earnestly importun'd by Love, forgot all respect, and shame; and believing, that that very day, he, whom she so tenderly loved, should unhappily end his dayes, and be a shamefull spectacle for
all the Court, jealous of his Vertues, and past Victories, went and cast her self at the King her Fathers feet, and full of tears, told him the reason she had, to beg Anaxanders life of him, whom she boldly avowed for her Husband, and with a thousand oaths, and by the testimony of her dead brother Arontus, she confirm'd the noyse that went of his illustrious extraction. The King was so moved, and troubled in his mind at those words, as he was a sufficient space without replying any thing: at length, look∣ing with extream severity upon the Princesse: Unhappy Woman, said he, is it possible thou wouldst endure thy self to be overtaken by this strangers prating, so mserable an unknown man, who is come so far to laugh at my lawes, to violate my Edicts, and happily thy self also; say, quickly, hath he stayn'd thy bed, and my race, and whether surpriz'd with his embraces, after thou went taken with his lies, thou gavest thy self up to his lewd desires. The Princess: exceedingly amazed to finde so harsh a usage from him, who had never been but very kinde to her, recollected yet, all her reason, and strength, not to seem troubled in her answer, and to try to perswade her Father, in her Lovers behalf. How Sir, said she, to him, could you have so ill an opinion of your Daughter as to think her able to commit so foul an Action? May not a man be valued without giving ones self up to him? and do you think me so filly, and light, to give Prince Anaxander the hearing, without
first assurances of his birth, as well by my dead Brother, as by his own confession: when in my Cousin Lisimenaes hearing, he made me an ample relation of all his adventures. Believe me Sir, if I have avowed him my affection, I have done it with all Modesty, becomming my Con∣dition, and my Sex, and being assured you never would dislike the sure of so vertuous a Prince: for my sake only he stole from his Parents, run great hazard in forein parts, and would not discover himself to you, but in a Princes equipage, which he was about to do, when you surpriz'd him with your guard. The King, whom rage had fully possessed, and made incapable of the Princesse reasons: O silly Maid, said he, how hast then been so cre∣dulous to his perswasions, whose errand here, was only to abuse thee? Where canst thou sinde me other proofs of his birth, than from his own mouth? he had, (sayst thou) perswaded thy Brother, as foolish as thy self, and some ground he must needs seek to build his treason on, and surprize thee. Were he the King of Cambayaes Son, would he have been so lo ng among us, and not have made himself known to some body? and had he lifted to have u s'd that quality to have married thee, would he not have sent to his Fa∣ther, who would have been but too glad to fa∣vour his so high pretences? But to let thee see, he is a meer deceiver, and that Anaxander is really dead, didst not thou lately see, that Pi∣robus confirm'd it, being sent Embassador to me from the King of Cambaya, and assur'd me, he
had only Alcidaris left of the two Children the gods had given him? Thinkest thou that if Anax∣ander had not been slain in that sally, with Piroxenus, and the two Princes of Decan, the King his Father who lamented him infinitely, and made all possible means to over-take him, would not have learn'd it by some of his servants, and that no man would be so charitable, as to raise the Queen Anaxarette from the deep melan∣choly wherein her dear sons losse had for ever cast her? Be gone unhappy Maid, reply no more, thou hast committed what thou never shalt re∣pair, by suffering that Persian impostor to abuse thy credulous, and simple youth, without remem∣bring that thy father is a King: I have lost half and more, of that esteem I had thy vertue in, thou shalt be the cause that I this day put him to death, whose life, but for his treason thou discoverest, I might have been willing enough to save. Be gon, go, weep thy fault, and in six months appear not in my sight. The poor Princesse had not courage to reply unto the sharpnesse of that last language, but full of confusion withdrew herself, considering the tragical designs, and her mind feeding on nothing but deadly thoughts: How said she, in her self, can I endure without resentment, that a Tyran: father, handle so unworthily, the dearest thing I love in the world? shall I not have so much credit as to save the one half of my soul, which a most cruel man will take from me? Ah wretch that I am, I went too fearfully unto him; who fearfully desires, teaches denial; I should have old
him boldly, that if he slew my husband, I would die with him, and that by death I would deliver me from his, and Fortunes tyranny: but that un∣worthy fear, which Nature too last hath bound unto my feeble sex, restrain'd my tongue, which could not execute, what my heart commanded; and yet I ruin thee my dear Anaxander, and yet I see thee given to death, without a power to help thee, so miserable am I; but what say I? she can∣not be accounted miserable, who can die easily. I will follow the, (my dear Anaxander,) Is it po∣ssible, that thou should'st die without me, whiles we two make but one? with me thou mayst; However I resolve to wait until the last hour, that if by some miracle, and particular mercy from heaven, the gods will save thy life, I may live with thee. With this bloody resolution, she retir'd into her Chamber, and driving from her as many as would divert her from her deadly sorrow, she caused a little Page whom she loved, to be call'd to her, and with a seeming setled understanding, and a countenance, which witnessed nothing lesse, than what was in her thoughts, bid him go buy a fine Dagger which she would give him, to wear with that little sword by his side, but that he should beware of letting her women know it, because they would be jealous of the love she bare him. This child, who was far from guessing at the Tragical design of his Mistresse, did present∣ly, as he was commanded; and with the money she gave him, bought a prety little Poinard, which he came and delivered her. As soon as
she found her self so strongly armed with a re∣medy against her misfortunes: Ariston, (said she,) (so was the Page called) I give thee leave to go see Ariomant executed by and by, set thy self as conveniently as thou canst, to see him, and as soon as thou see'st his head off, come as fast as thou canst, and bring me word; but left thou lose thy Dagger in the throng, ile keep it till thy return. The poor innocent, resolv'd to do as his Mi∣strisse commanded him, and in the mean while, the unfortunate Orazia, who would not dine, shut her self in her closet, where being alone sh: freely discharg'd her heart, which was however but of tears; when it was throughly drayn'd, her agony was full as violent, and lasting, twas agi∣tated with an everlasting sorrow, which the poor afflicted Lady promised shortly to determine by the end of her life, and for that purpose kept the little dagger, (which Ariston had delivered her) in her bosome, to make use of it as soon as she should hear of her Lovers death. While she remaind in this deadly trouble, and bloody displeasure, lets see what Piroxenus did on his side; when he heard publickly, that there was no more hope for his friend; and that the Judge who pronounced the sentence of death upon him, had been in vain perswading the King, that he should do well to delay the exe∣cution, untill the truth of what the offender said concerning his extraction, were known. In∣deed, he took an ill time, to discourse with that Prince, on the instant when he was a fresh
insensed against his daughter; so as he gave him no more speed than her, and that advertisement, but made him hasten so much sooner the execu∣tion, and redouble his anger. Almost the whole Gentry of the Court consi∣dered that execution with horror, and not suffi∣ciently able to bemoan his misfortune that was to be the first example, in an action for which no man was ever known to be put to death, though many in like case have in their absence been con∣demn'd; but they ever upon the first stir of War made their accommodations, which being over, the King obliged himself likewise to forget their crimes past, and threaten them again by new E∣dicts, which were lately published to Anaxanders confusion. But let us leave these needlesse digressions, to acquit our selves of our promise, in making all the world see the incomparable sorrow of that incomparable friend, that faithful Piroxenus, who till that time conceal'd himself (as guilty as A∣naxander,) to see if he could finde any means to succour him. When he perceiv'd that he had no more to hope, he thought he had no more to fear, and seeing that they were about to carry his other self to execution, his dear and faithful friend, for whom in times past, during Orixa's misfortune, he had been forc'd to live, he was not long to resolve whether he ought to die with him or no. When he knew, that he was taken out of pri∣son, to be conducted to his end, environed with two companies of the Kings guard, he drew his
sword to run himself through, but recalling him∣self instantly from that precipirate actiō: My deer Anaxander, said he, I may not in this manner fol∣low thee, since having lived so well, and wor∣thily, thou art ready to die in favour with the gods, and that I see already, heaven open to re∣ceive thee, I should never meet they happy soul, if I should commit this outrage on my self, and move the gods by this so contrary action to the laws of Nature. For thy sake then I will not die by my own hands, because our souls may meet again; but I will force that rabble which encompasse thee, to give me the stroak of death; Ile throw my self among them, and the gods shall bear me witnesse, that I advance not my daies, by an unworthinesses of heart, which makes me sinck under under the burden of my sorrows. I know it is the part of a couragious man, to re∣sist with constancy the crosses of Fortune; that to stand up against her, is to scorn her, and to endure her evils patiently, is to deride her; But my dear Cousin, I am nto able I confesse, to en∣dure for thy sake, what I could for my own: be it how it will, I mean to follow thee, and should curse my life, a thousand times, if I should hap∣pen to out-live thee a minute. Thus saying, in great fury he came forth of his house, and without farther care of being known in the streets, went strait to the place, where the poor Anaxander was bound upon the Scaffold, paler through anger, than through fear, and re∣solute to die, in that disability to defend himself from the outrage they committed on his innocency.
When Piroxenus saw him in that pittiful condition, he grew doubly incensed, and in that passion of rage which blinded him, resolv'd to re∣venge his own, and his friends death, on those who were not guilty of it; and in spite of those that guarded the place, who were ranged like a hedg and environed the Scaffold, to make way with his two swords unto it, that he might once more say farewell to him he lov'd a thousand times more than himself. The two Bracmanes, who attended Anaxan∣der, had already begun the last prayers for his soul, all the company answered the sad time which they prayed in, and the Heas  expect∣ed but the end of the Canticle to give the dead∣ly blow, had the Princes hair in hsi hand to cut it away, that it might not hinder the striking off his head, when the hopelesse Piroxenus took his time, to fly through that innumerable multitude of people, which gave way to his two swords, which he handled with a great deal of cunning, and fury; he mowed down the very enclosure of Souldiers, maiming and cleaving all he met in his way; & when he had got the middle of the place, he presently ascended the unhappy Thea∣ter, where so Tragical an action was to be repre∣sented, and seeing the Hangman handling the Princes hair; Art thou said he, so infamously impudent as to touch that sacred head, and there∣withall cleft his to the neck, and suddainly un∣binding his dear Anaxander, he gave the other sword into his hands. Those Souldiers who suspected nothing, and
were far from fearing any attempt for Anaxan∣der deliverance, were wonderfully amazed, and astonished, that the boldnesse of one man procee∣ded to that extream temerity, by and by, by their Captains command, who blasphem'd for anger, they encompassed the Scaffold, which wae raised some ten steps, and could not be come to with∣out a Ladder; but as many as offred to come up were hewn in pieces, and those two Lions, who look'd for nothing lesse, than saving themselves, did wonderful effects, to sell their lives, and well dispute them. When Anaxander saw that they recoiled, and dared no longer approach them: Friends, said he to them, the gods are my witnesses that with sor∣row I spill your blood, remember when I led you in War, and how, (it may be,) I help'd you very well to set the Crown on his head, who now would take away my life for an action of honor, whereto beside, I was provoked by Lisi∣mantus fault. Since my ruin is inevitable, he shall shortly see, what tis tomeddle with the sone of Kings his neighboure, who give not place to him for power. Friends, said Piroxenus to the people, on the other side, if ye knew the mischief which threa∣teneth you in our losse, ye would all take arms to save us from the fury of a Tyrant, whom we have delivered from the oppression of two slaves, who were greedy after your goods and lives. Know, that however you see us, we are two mighty Princes, left to the severity of Fortune, and if the outrage unjustly begun, be finished upon
us, ye shall all suffer, though ye be innocent, and very shortly see, all the King of Cambayas power fall upon you, and your children, who is my mothers brother, and that unhappy Princes sa∣ther, whom I but now unloosed from the Hang∣mans hands. These discourses assisted by the gracesful action of those two men of so excellent aspect, began already to work some impression in the peoples minds; there was not one civil man, who with horror beheld not the injustice done those two brave courages, and who would not willingly have hazarded his life for their safety; but the sequel was of too much fear, and the dread of the Kings anger restrained the most factious a∣mong them: Meanwhile, the Souldiers by the Captains command were gone to setch Lad∣ders to assault our Princes on every side, and try to take them alive, that by an ignominious death, the slaughter they had made on their companions might be revenged, forbidding any arrows to be shot at them, which had by some been done al∣ready; when from the Palace gate-ward, a great throng was seen to come, and the King himself before them, which began to cry on all sides, grace: but the confused noise the Souldiees made about the Scaffold, hindred them from hearing that favorable cry; when the King who caused room to be made, by the Archers of his guard who went before him, was come neer, and had understood what Piroxenus had done, he wondered, and more again, when he saw the two Princes defend themselves so couragiously against
an armed multitude. Hold, cry'd he out to the Souldiers, as soon as he could be heard: all that were before him did the like, in as much as at length, those blood-thirsty men perceived the King neer them, and heard his countermands. His presence then, having clamed the storm, all held their peace, and bent their eyes upon him, to see what 'twas he would command them, and understand the reason of his comming personally there; when turning towards the Princes, who were not lesse astonish'd at his comming, than the people, and directing his speech to them, spake in this manner. I am so full of confusion, Sirs, for what I very lately have understood, that whereas you think I am come to give you pardon, I come to ask it of you, and to conjure you likewise, to forgive me a crime, which I have ignorantly committed, and whereof my passion only, is guilty. See said he to Prince Anaxander, if you know this young Kinight, Gentleman of the horse to the King your father, tis he that hath unfolded me my errour, and who hath freed me from a misfortune, after which I never should have been comforted, if the last act of the Tragedy had been performed on you. When the Prince, (who was already well re∣stored, by the Kings mild language,) knew Falan∣tus face, he leapt from off the Scaffold and embra∣ced him, Piroxenus did the like, & then presently turning to the King: In truth, Sir, said Anaxan∣der, you were a little too hasty, and me thinks, you should for me, have made use of your accu∣stomed
wildom, and have een whether the re∣port spread in your Court concerning my extra∣ction, were true or no, before you used so great severity, as you have done. However, seeing the gods have pleas'd to stay the course of this mis∣fortune, we must forget what's past, and promise, Sir, that neither my Cousin nor my self, will remain lesse affectionate to your service, seeing it is our own fault, we had not told you who we were. Consider me, Sirs, said the King, as your selves, and judge if the report of your death be∣ing every where dispers'd, and being lately re∣newed to me, by the King of Cambayas Ebas∣sadour, who assur'd me, his Master had but one son only living, call'd Alcidaris, I had not cause to believe, all to be lies, that have been toldme of you? verily, after all those untruths, accom∣panied with so many of your feignings, and dis∣guises, I had very good reason to redouble my anger against you Anaxander, when I understood from my daughters own mouth, that without declaring your self to any body, and passing but at an ordinary Knight, you had taken the free∣dom to talk to her of love, and contract a Marri∣age with her, wihout my consent, which had ne∣ver been deny'd you, had I known your birth: You have certainly cause to be angry with your selves, for the wrong which hath been done you: but for what I have contributed, I promise to re∣pair the injury by so many testimonies of assecti∣on, as you both shall henceforth have more rea∣son to love, than you have formerly had cause to hate me.
But in regard, this is no proper place for com∣plements, lets go together to the Palace, and make my Daughter partake of our joy, and first of all, lets thank the gods, which have delivered you, from the imminent danger threatned you, by you own fault; and have sent thi Knight of Cambaya, at the very minute, to secure your lives. At these words the Princes redoubled their embraces of Falantus; and truly they had great reason so to do, as he who by his incredble dili∣gence became their redeemer, having in four daies, and as many nights, rid more than two hundred leagnes, whereto, that excellent horse very much contributed, which he took with him, whereon without stop, he dispatched eight or nine Posts; by this means he arrived at the time he should, to save their lives so dear to the King his Master, and had he more delai'd, un∣doubtedly he had in vain perform'd that jour∣ney; for the two generous Prince, had been forc'd to yield to the power of so great a num∣ber of Souldiers, as were ready to assault them every where. They departed then from that place, to go di∣rectly to the Temple; and in the meanwhile, the little Ariston, who had seen all these passages, went before to advertise his Mistresse, whom he found, laid on a little bed in her Closet, wholly over come with sorrow, and already threatning her fair bosome, with the Dagger, from which she hoped all her remedy. As soon as she saw the Page come in, she rose
up, and taking the Dagger in her hand; Is't done, my friend, said she, is Ariomant dead? No Madam, answer'd he, the King himself came and delivered him, and did him all manner of honor; there is some mystery in the matter which I know not; for I understood by the con∣fused noise, which I heard from the middle of the place, that the offender was the King of Cam∣bayaes son; he told her after, what Piroxenus had done, and the memorable exploits they both perform'd upon the Scaffold. The Princesse transported with that news, which she well enough understood, could not forbear embracing the little Ariston, and was a quarter of an hour and more in a kinde of trou∣ble; truly he did well to come, and prepare her mind for that joy: for if at first it had come to her, from the Kings mouth, she could never have forborne to have shewn her ravishment, whereas, she had the time to compose her self, to receive that pleasure without disquiet, and to accompa∣ny her countenance, with a modest coldnesse, when her father came. As soon as he had thank'd the gods, he entred the Princesse chamber, followed by Anaxander, piroxenus, and Falantus, who however well pre∣pared for that visit, had much to do to disuise her contentment, and retain her joy; so long it was, that she had not seen her dear Anaxander, as that only consideration was enough to shake her resolution, and her constancy, and discover openly to the King her father, the impatiency of her mind, and violence of her love: yet she
contain'd her self, and save one amorous glance she cast by stealth on Anaxander, nothing unor∣dinary was observed in her welcome. Daughter, said the King, comming neer her, you had reason to solicit for Anaxanders free∣dom, and I confesse I was too blame, in not sa∣tisfying my self of a truth, which you so reso∣lutely maintained: but fince that errour is re∣mitted me, lets talk no more, but how to reme¦dy it, and forget all our displeasures past, to in∣vent delights, and give our selves over to ou joy. I declare that heartily I confirm that Mar∣riage contracted secretly between you, seeing tis true, that honor was the ground of your lover, and that nothing but vertue and modesty hath appear'd in you embraces, and for a testimony of my consent, I will in my presence have you now renew your vows, and that Falantus may assure his Master of my granting all he asks; while I take order, that your Marriage be solem∣niz'd, with a pomp to set all Asia in astonishment, and make my greatnesse be admir'd of all my neighbours. At these words our lovers could no longer con∣ceal their transports, they chang'd not only faiths, but kinde embraces, before all the company, and with mutual tears of joy which ran from their eyes, they dewed one another. Mean∣while, the King having learn'd, that Lisimantus was comming with so mighty an Army, which advanced to no purpose, and that he was to mar∣ry his Neece Lisimena, he sent an Embassadour with speed to meet him, and acquaint him what
had past, and to enquire whether he would not partake of their contentment, and desire to cele∣brate his Marriage, with his brother Anaxanders in his Country. Only Piroxenus now as to be pleased, whose story the King was very glad to hear, and much more, to see that he was able to shew such argu∣ments of his generosity as to the rest, for though the whole Kingdom of decan, was re-restablish'd under his obtdience, and he the sole and peacea∣ble possessor of it, knowing that the fair Orixa was yet living, he restor'd her presently her twelve Provinces, and thought fit, that Piroxenus should go to her, who liv'd unknown still, and carry her this good news himself, and bring her to Bisnagar with Royall equipage, that those three happy Marriages, might be solemnized at once. After his dispatch to Lisimantus, and Orixa, he sent back Falantus to Alcidaris, that he, better than any man, might expresse his own, and all his subjects joy, whereof that great monarch in∣tended to come, and share in his own person; The Queen Anaxarette, not contented with the relations which would be made her of the mag∣nificences prepared for her sons Wedding, resol∣ved to accompany him in that journey. They then, fitted themselves as soon as they could, and having left good Garisons in their Countries, although in peace, they chose out the most expert Cavalliers of their Court, and the handsomest women of Amadaba, Campanel, and Cambaye, to conduct them to that delightful
place, where so many felicities expected them, and causing a good part of the preparations for Lisimantus entrance, and for Anaxanders, and Piroxenus return, to follow them in Chariots. The King of Zeylan, having known hereof by a Post dispatched to him by the King his bro∣ther in law, he would likewise carry with him his daughter, whom with a great deal of content∣ment he had vowed to Lisimantus, whose birth he learnt from Albalot, whom Alcidaris had sent him, and failed not to be waited on by all the beauty of his Island, that his Subjects might be seen to want, nor skill, nor power, and that they might compare with all other nations. He did Albalot the honor to take him into his own Ship, with all the Cambayan Knights, whom he brought with him, that in a more stately train, they might go all to Baticalus, which is the next Haven to Bisnagar. That City was exceeding great, and one of the most renowned of the East; but by reason of the great multitude, and innumerable affluence which came from all parts of Asia to make some at the sports prepared, and magnificencies, which invited every body to them, they were fain to set up Tents and Pavillions without the Walls, and mark out all the lodgings of the City, for the followers of those three Kings, who came with the fairest and the richest ornaments of their Courts. They all arrived severally, at that stately City, which at that time, might justly boast to be the splendor, and the glory of the East; So great a
pomp, and so many wonders were never seen before together, and I must make a Volume grea∣ter far than this, if I would undertake to describe them all exactly, and expresse the ravishments of all our Princes, in their common rancounters, as the Author of this book hath done, with all the Conquests they have made (since their Marri∣ages) of Lands usurped from Tamberlins children, from whom they were descended; but besides that other occasions busie me, I should fear that this History might passe for a Fable, becanse it would not be believed, that Indian King were so mighty in their States as in my writings. It shall suffice, that I tell you how that great Mogull, who at this day makes all the East trem∣ble, and who justly boasts to be the greatest Mo∣narch of the World, vaunts him also to be is∣sued out of Alcidaris, the sole remainder of great Tamberlins race, and to descend in a right line from Anaxander. This whole History is painted in his great Palace Gallery at Lahor, and in that of Dely, which he hath had with the Kingdom of Citor, and Decan by succession of Piroxenus, who died childlesse, as he hath inhe∣rited Cambaya, and divers other Kingdoms lost, and gotten again, by the death of such as have descended from Lisimantus. He got other great Countries and Kingdoms, by his valor, as all Indostan, which is bounded by Indus, and Gan∣ges, where the great City Agria is situated, which is one of the chiefest scats of his Empire; for he remaineth mostly at Lahor, which is above fix score leagues from the Coast of Cambaya, of
whose magnificences all the East do talk with wonder. He possesseth likewise, Bengalus, Aracam▪ Ava, Verma, and an infinite number of other King∣doms, on this side Ganges and beyond: but som: likewise have been taken from his Prdeceessors, of those which lawfully belonged to him, as Narsinga, Calicut, and all the Coasts of Malabor, which after Piroxenus death were divided into divers little Kingdoms, of some of which the Por∣tugals have made themselves Masters, during the reign of Emanuel, and since. Yet at this time the Idalcan, and the Nissamaluque enjoy all, that the two slaves revolters, Rozalcan, and Zabain usurped from Demonax, and oppose themselves against his almightinesse, with as much courage, as at this day the Hollanders do, against their law∣ful Lord. A friend of mine, who hath been a Voyage in∣to the East Indies, took this History out of the great Moguls Cabinet, which I have translated in∣to our Language; But he added all the magnifi∣cencies of our three Hero's Weddings, out of which I have drawn this little Summary, to make appear, that they come not short for dexterity of the Knights of Europe, and that they are capable of all the gallantries of which we vainly believe our selves the first inventors. I will not repeat in order the wonders of the field, wherein were imployed all the ornaments of Architecture that could be found, nor of the Kings Scaffold, the Ladies, and the Judges, where∣of, Jasper, Marble, and Porphire, were the least
adornments, nor the Hero's ceremonies, nor the entries and retraits of the defendants and assai∣lants, nor all the wonders of the Tryumphs. Cr∣rouzels, which are very amply described, in all the representations of the Combats, which per∣tained to the magnificence of those publique Feasts; but I will mention only some of their Rules, which I found very pretty, as well in their Fencing Combats, which they more freqoently practise than the rest of all India on this side Ganges, as in their fighting with Darts. Those of Fencing in throng, are two manner of waies used among them ordinarily, by such as defend or maintain Ambition, against those that maintain Love; of these latter, there are two sorts, the pleased, against the malcontents, and the malecontents against the despairers; No man comes into the place of Fence, save the Comba∣tants, and their God-fathers, except such as can proove that they have there gained five Victories formerly, and such are set by the Judges side to assist them. The Combats of Darts are more mysterious; for a man can use no other than such as are gi∣ven by Ladies. They take glory in obliging strangers particularly, by the civility of enter∣tainment, in their houses, and send them the fairest they can devise, adorn'd with characters, and devises, and the Combatants tie them to their Girdles with great gold and silk Ribbans. The God-fathers, go and entreat the Combatants Mistresser, that they may have their liking, to bear such names as they have chosen, and after∣ward
cause them to be written down, before the Judges of the Combat, who cannot exercise that office, untill they have been at the least, ten times Conquerers; the Heralds of Arms are at the entrance of the field, to do their messages, clad in very rich coats of Arms, aster the Indian manner; Before the Combat begins, because the field is of a square form, the four Heralds go to the four corners, to publish the Law, and Ordi∣nances of Combat, which the Judges deliver them, whereof I give you here the tenor. 1 NO man may enter the combat except he first shew a Favor from his Mistress, which she must publickly allow of. 2 If two Rivals fight, though either of them be hurt, no man may seperate them ex∣cept the Mistresse command it, the rest are parted by the Judges. 3 He that lets fall his Dart cannot take it up again but by his enemies leave, and a great many that will not ask it assault their adver∣saries with their Target. 4 Each carries the Arms of his house in his Target above, and his devise under, and his Ladies Picture in the middle. 5 The conquered are led prisoners before the Ladies from whom they crave two liber∣ties, the one that they may be freed from the chains of Love, the other from those that binde them.
6 The Conquered gives up his Target to his Mistresse, because her Picturec is there pain∣ted, and the Conqueror delivers his prisoners Dart to his. 7 If a Combatant fall, it is death to hurt him on the ground, and losse of honor to hurt him upon his knee. 8 The Combatant that findes himself strongest must cast his eyes upon the Knight of honor, who holds a Pennon, compos'd of all the Ladies Liveries; for if he lift it up, it is a sign of grace, and that the Ladies will have the other weaker, no longer oppressed in their presence. 9 That Lady, who hath had ten Victorious Lovers, which she may verifie by her Darts, hath voice in the Ordinances of the Combat as the Judges have. They observe likewise some others, but I found only these in the entertainments, at our Lovers solemnity, who were of all parts of the gallantry exprest in honor of them, by the most expert Knights of the four Kingdoms I have de∣scribed; A great many other adventurers per∣sented themselves, as well of Baticalus, as other neighbour Provinces, who excellently acquitted themselves, as well in the regulated exercises, as in the Combats of throng, where a thousand Bat∣talions encountred with great skill and cou∣rage.
The Trumpets gave them encouragement a∣gainst one another, and nothing seen but a plea∣sing consusion, from whence the shouts on all sides, in some sort, equalled the pleasure of the cars with that of the eye. The strong had there the advantage, and in those innocent Combats, the weak falling under the harmelesse blowe, gave the beholders greater joy than pitty. Anaxander who was the chief of the defen∣dants, in the Combat of theA kine of Spear. ZI∣gayes, was very advantagiously cloath'd, and mounted; but the lustre of his countenance, was sarre above that of the Diamonds, which were rough cast, as it were, upon his Arms; his Tar∣get was the Master-peice of an excellent China workman, whereon, no riches possible was spa∣red, to adorn it: above, there were the Arms of Dulcinda, and because they bear sinople, all the field was Emerods, and the rest, of Rubies, and Diamonds; under these Arms, according to the Laws establish'd by the Judges, the fair Orazia was painted to the life, with the Arms of Narsin∣ga, empaled with Bisnagar, and Orixa, which sparkled with a fiue grace in a corner of the Pi∣cture, under which, were written these six verses in Arabick, which I have thus translated. How her black Eyes attractive be, What fires they have, what darts we see, How dexterous, and how sull of might, How handsome are their Victories, What sweetnesse, and what power of right, To take our Hearts, and Eyes?
Under that Picture, was a new devise which he had taken, after so many crosses, and mis∣fortunes, and that he had passed from sorrow to joy, and from the apprehension of so many deaths, unto a happy life. The body wa's shin∣ing Sun, sending forth beams, with these words, which have more elegance in Arabick. After the Night and Clouds. Lisimantus on his part march'd in a wonder∣ful pomp, leading the first day of the Sports and ceremonies, the Troop of adventurers. Be∣cause he was as a stranger in Narsinga, a great part of the foreiners ranged themselves under his Standard; his Harnesse, as well as his horses, was stately, he had the same advantages of natural grace, as in the invention of his habit, which I forbear to describe, which his brother had; The Arms of Cambaya were painted on his Buck∣ler, with like ornament to his brother Anaxan∣der under them, was the Picture of his dear Lisi∣mena; and because she was somwhat browner than Orazia, which diminish'd nothing of her beauty, many thought that somwhat of purpose he accompanied it with these verses. How this brown hue doth shame the fair, Mix'd as it is, with blood so rare, Which ever ravish'd hath my frame, A man would say, its glory lies, In being swarted by that flame, Which riseth from her Eyes.
Under the Picture, was his devise, which he had likewise newly taken, and since he knew his birth, to which only it seemed, they gave the prize which his love and vertue deserved, he had for the body, a great Looking-glasse painted, whost Curtain was draw with these words, which signifie somwhat more in their language. I was acknowledg'd, when I knew my self. Piroxenus, and the other Princes, and Knights, had likewise very sine devises in their Targets, and were all richly clad, and waited on with stately equipages in their Combats, as their Car∣rouzels, which followed, where a number o∣great Elephants, and Lions, were seen to do unst imaginable things: but as I have already said, besides that I should fill three greater Volumes than this, if I should describe all particulars, I should cause the Author of this admirable Histo∣ry, to be doubted for a Lyer. FINIS.
