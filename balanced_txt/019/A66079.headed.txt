A WARNING TO ALL FRIENDS Who Professeth the Everlasting Truth of God, which he hath Revealed and made manifest in this his Blessed Day, (whether on this Side, or beyond the Seas.) Dear Friends, IN Tender Bowels of love, do I feel (from the Lord) a warning Spring in my heart to you, that you all may be kept low in his humble self denying Life, where safety is to be found. For assuredly, the great and Notable day of the Lord is at hand, in which he will arise in the greatnesse of his strength, to plead the cause of his suffering Seed, with all its enemies, whether within, or without. So all Dear Friends be faithful under your several dispen∣sations, For in our Fathers house are many Mansions, Keep in the low valleys; For there will be your safety, there will the green pastures of Gods love be partaken of, and with such will he delight to dwell. So all Friends keep to your watch, that the day of the Lord come not in an hour you look not for it, and so you receive the unfaithful Servants Reward, for indeed Friends my soul is in a great Travel for the Prosperity of Sion, that her walls may be builded, her breaches Repaired and made up. For, for many month
yea some years, hath my spirit been bowed down and groaned under the sense of an easeful, selfish, Lukewarm Spirit, that hath crept in upon many for want of watchfulnesse, and Keeping to the Dayly Cross of Christ Jesus, and in the Narrow way, and Savoury life, that only will bring ho∣nour and praise to the Name of the Lord. And how to be eased of these weights and burdens I did not know, my cry was to the Lord that he would give me wisdome, and strength to do his will. And it pleased him to lay his hand upon me and bring me near to the gates of Death (so far as I saw) and was pleased to hide himselfe from me, and my Soul was in a languishing condition, and my cryes was great unto the Lord that he would not hide his face from me, but let me feel of his wonted goodness, and mercy, by which I had received daily comfort and satisfaction from him in his unerring path, in which he had been pleased to lead me. And at length the Lord appeared, and said he would be my Phisition and cure my disease, and came in and comforted my Spirit, with his overcoming love, which greatly revived me. And in the openings of the bowels of his endlesse love, he shewed me, a Terrible day drew near, (even as one may say at the doors.) And laid it upon me, to goe warn his people in this City (and elsewhere) to Depart from all fil∣thinesse both of flesh and Spirit, from all Lukewarmness, from the fashions, customes, and friendships of this world, from Pride, Covetousness and every sin that seperatech from the Lord, and brings drynesse, barronnesse, and deadnesse, upon many, and made as unsavoury salt, that was good for nothing, but to be cast forth and trodden upon. And to warn them not to delay time, but come into the true humility, lowlinesse of spirit, and felfedenying life, that the Lord might be a hiding place to them, for terrible will that day be to all the unfaithful and disobedient. All the sinners in Sion shall be afraid, fearfulnesse shall take hold on
the Hypocrite. Dread and horror shall surprise them. O whither will you unfaithful fly! would you not be glad that either Rocks or Mountains could hide you from the presence of the Lord, and the wrath of the Lamb. O this will be a terrible day indeed, unto all those that have had a form of Godlinesse, but denyed the power, that would have saved them out of all defilements and pollutions of this world. For long hath the Spirit of the Lord been grieved with these, who have long come and sitten amongst Gods people, as if they had been of them, but never came to sink down to the heart searching Light of Christ Jesus in them, that by it they might be cleansed, from all secret and open sins, from every Dalilah that lodgeth in the bosome, as Pride and Coveteousnesse, which often the one attends the other, Covetousnesse (saith the servant of the Lord,) is the root of all evil, and advised them to fly from it, but who abide not in the spirit of judgement, and of Burning, which God hath prepared to purge away the filth of the daughter of Sion, their filth hath not been purged nor done away, which causeth many miscarriages, blots and staines, and great Re∣flections have such brought upon the blessed truth; and much dirt hath been thrown upon the pure holy undefiled way of the Lord, which he hath cast up, for the Ransomed to walk in, and so through the unfaithfulness and uneven walking of such, the name of the Lord hath been greatly dishonoured, his Spirit grieved, and the hearts of the Righteous made sad. And many a wounded Soul there is amongst the Lords people, who are bowed under these weights and pressures, but assuredly the day hastens that every one must bear their own burden, and the Lord will case his Innocent ones, who have been bowed down before him, and have mourned and groaned under these things: yea, the day hastens, that the unfaithful and disobedient shall
bear their own burdens. And the Lord will arise for his own Name and Glory sake, and will case him of his enemies, and avenge him of his adversaries, and take to himselfe his great power, that he may Reign and Rule in the hearts of his, that (faithfully labour in his work, and) ordereth their conversations aright before him; his glory shall rest upon them, for he will not give it to another seed, or birth, but to Christ Jesus the seed of the woman; who was given to bruise the Serpents head; he hath born the iniquities of all, and been pressed under them as a Cart with sheaves, his face hath been more marred then any mans, and his voice not heard in the streets, no beauty nor comlinesse seen in him. And because he hath been a man of sorrowes, and acquain∣ted with griefs, therefore hath he been passed by and not re∣garded, but the Lord will make him the joy of many Ge∣nerations; and his Sion the praise of the whole earth. Therefore Dear Friends, love him with all your Souls, and be you delighted in him, above all injoyments whatever, that you may lye down in the bosome of his love, and be nourished by his side, as Children of our heavenly-Father; begotten by the Immoral word of life, to Live and Reign hear with him (in it,) and when time shall be no more, enter into that blessed rest, prepared for all them that have obey∣ed his glorious Gospel: and though as yet we be but as the gleaning of the Vintage, yet the Lord hath many to gather year, the numberless number shall be gathered. And great will be the work of our God, which he is bringing to pass in this his blessed day, it cannot be declared, as it is seen and felt in the spirit. So Friends be faithful in the work of your day, be valliant for the Lord and his blessed truth: Come up in the Nobillity of his life, and stand faithful witnesses for him; for we are the City set upon a hill, yea, battle Axes in Gods hand, Though our weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual, and
mighty through the power of God, to the pulling down the strong holds of sin and Sathan: Friends, we are they whom the Lord hath raised to hold forth Christ Jesus, whom he hath given for an ensign to the Nations, unto whom all the ends of the earth must come for salva∣tion; So Dear Friends, let your light shine forth before men that they may see your good workes and gloryfie your heavenly father, so that by your godly life and holy con∣versation many may enquire the way to Sion. All Friends be faithful, and keep your meetings, in the fear of the Lord, be dilligent in his work, for the woe and Curse belongs to them that do the Lords work negli∣gently (or with careless minds,) and it is come on some all-ready, and will come more upon others, if by speedy re∣pentance they return not unto the Lord. So be Zealous for the Lord and his truth, and as much as in you lies gather orderly together as neare the time as possible; that the meeting is appointed at, for Disorderly comeing hath been a hurt and burdened the faithfull who dare not be negligent, in the Lords work; and often they have waited a Considerable season and Gods power hath been felt, and the manifold grace of God been dispensed a∣mongst us, and then others comes in: and misses of the Counsels, Admonitions, and Refreshments which the Lord by the operation of his blessed spirit hands forth to his people, and so for want of Zeal in comeing duly to meet∣ings (especially on the week dayes) truth hath not grown in them, but such have long travelled in the wilderness: and many Carkasses fall'n there, and so for want of Zeal and faithfulness the enemy hath crept in, and darkned many minds, where once there was tender good desires raised after God, So all have need to be faithful and wait
dilligently every oppertunity the Lord gives you to feel your strengths renewed, for in the world is many Incum∣brances and Intanglements, some on one hand, and some on another to draw the mind from God, (and but one to draw it to him,) so there is great need of holy zeal and dilligence, in observing the time to wait upon the Lord to feel your strength renewed; to help through the many things and his power to strengthen and support, that in your families and all your undertakings you may be a good savour to the Lord, being guided by his wisdome to rule and order your Children and Servants, and he will give Authority to stand over every thing thats contrary to his witness, And in the feare of the Lord I warn and Exhort all parents not to winke or Connive at any sin in your Children, as you tender their Ever∣lasting welbeing, let no sin go on reproved or corrected, but take the wise mans counsel who saith; Folly is bound up in the heart of a Child but the rod of Cor∣rection must drive it out, And he that corrects his Child shall deliver his Soul from Death: So friends Traine up your Children in the Blessed truth and fear of the Lord, So may you have hope they will not depart from it (when they are old.) And take heed of giving way or suffering them to get into pride, and the vain and foolish fashions, which are a shame to Sober people, and a great inlet to many evils, for they are prone to that by nature, and it may soon be set up, but hard to get it down; So Friends keep the yoak upon that Nature thats Proud, Stubborn, or Disobedient to Parents, break that will in them betimes which comes from the evil one, and bend them while they are young, least when they grow up yon cannot. And then you may sorrow greatly when it is too late, for by your over looking their Folly, or Pride, the wrong Nature
growes in them to a strong head, whereby you have help∣ed them forwards in the broad way which leads to de∣struction, and their blood (may come) to be required at your hands. Ah Friends, friends, as much as in you lies keep down the evil, and the good will arise, then their will be Room for the tender seed to grow up in them, and they will bless the Lord on your behalfs, for your love and care of their Immortal Souls. And all Masters and Mistrisses of Families, Keep in the Dominion of Truth, that in it you may Rule over every unclean thing, and wrong Spirit, that is contrary to the Lord, that you abiding in him who is the highest power, (and higher then the powers of darkenesse) may in it keep in your Authority in your Families, and look that all be kept sweet and clean, out of the Condemnable state, first in your selves; and then in your families to see that all Wildness, Wantonness, and Rudeness, be kept under by the power; yea every thing that would blot or staine the precious truth. And then if the Lord Require any Service or Testimony of any of you, (for this name and bles∣sed truth,) that all may be cleare in your selves and justi∣fied by Gods witness, that you have stood in his Counsel and Authority in your families and been good Examples in life and conversation, by keeping your own houses in the good Order, and Ruleing their for God, then may you openly with boldness appear for the Lord, and thresh down sin and every evil way, in the power and Authority of his life, that none may have any thing to accuse any of you, (on the accounts above mentioned,) And deare Friends all keep in the savory life; but more especially you who are drawn forth to beare publick Testimonys for the Lord and his blessed truth, keep you to the watch that at all times, Places, and on all occa∣sions
your lives may preach for God, by a clean unspot∣ed Conversation, which is the Crown of all the faithfull, who labour in the worke of the Lord, and are upright before him, his Glory shall rest upon them and their Re∣ward is sure. Now unto all you young people Sons and Daughters, Apprentices, Men or Maids, Servants, all that are con∣vinced of Gods truth and the way that leads to everlasting life and happiness, be you all faithful to Gods witness in you, and mind the motions and opperations of it, that thereby you may be changed, and all judge out whats contrary to his pure witness, let not your minds wander neither look out at the vanities in this world, for Christs Kingdome is not of it, nor to be found in Pride, wan∣tonness and lusts of the flesh; The Fashions, Customes, and friendships of this world, for the Devil is the King of pride, and all its attendants that leads to the gates of Hell and everlasting destruction, where is the Woe and Misery and that for evermore, there the worm never dyes, the fire never goes out, so all you young and tender ones, where desires are begotten after God, keep you low in his fear, and to the daily Cross that all the contrary may be crucified, and all the En∣mitie slain upon it. For every one that will be a disciple of Christ Jesus, must come into the selfedenying life, (you cannot have two Kingdomes,) So my advice to you all is, stoop to Christs appearance in you, he who In∣vites all to come and learn of him, who is meek and lowly and you shall find rest to your souls. So all be faithful in your several places and the exercises you may be under, that you may grow in grace and in the feare and wisdome of God, let not your eys look out at o∣thers, but mind your own Conditions for if you do it
will Spye many faults in others, and may be over look more at home, This hinders the grouth of many, so all waite low within to feel your grouth in the Blessed truth, and know how the work goes on, and whether thou feel Gods love, mercy and goodness Renewed to thee day by day, or not, for your accounts will be for the deeds done in your bodyes and not for other, so every one is to labour to know your calling and election made sure. And you that are Apprentices keep in the truths love and obey it, for it will keep you faithful in your places and (out of every deceitful way) performing them not with eye-service but with singlenesse of heart, as unto the Lord, from whom you must receive a Reward. And if the enemy entice, consent not. Though he come in with never so fair pretences; that thou may'st deceive thy Master, and it will never be known &c. Or purloin or waste his Goods, believe him not he is a Lyer and the Father of lies, for there is an Eye that sees in secret, which will bring all the hidden deeds of darkness to Light and every worke to judgement, So as thy worke is shall be thy Reward. But fear the Lord and obey his voice in thee, and he will deliver thee out of every unclean way, and polluted path, by his dear Son Christ Jesus whom he hath given for a high way of Holyness, and a Restorer of paths to dwell in, Glory to his Name for ever, saith the Redeemed, who is now returning unto Sion with Songs of diliverance in their mouths; and everlasting high praises is sounded unto him, by those whose garments are made white in the blood of the Lamb, for Sions Redeemer is come, the taker away of sin and iniquity is made manifest, the mourners in Sion comforted, The weary Travelers are Refreshed, The feeble knees are
strengthened, the broken Spirit bound up, and the wound∣ed Soul hath oyle poured in, who can but rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for he hath put a new Song in our mouths, he hath given his people beauty for Ashes, and in stead of heavinesse the spirit of praise, all that know him will speak well of his name, for all the Noble Acts he hath brought to pass for his Children. My soul is greatly affected in the Remembrance of the Lords num∣berlesse mercyes (to me) and a little Remnant whom he hath pluck't as Brands out of the fire, to shew forth his praises and declare of his goodnesse in the Land of the living, to hold forth Christ (the way to the Father,) To the Nations, that his scattered seed may be gathered from all the ends of the earth. So I have cleared my Spirit of what hath long lain upon me, and discharged my Conscience in delivering the Lords Message faithfully, ac∣cording to the abillity he hath given me. And so am clear in my Spirit: The Lord set it home up∣on every heart whom it may concerne, and that it may be Received, in the same bowels of love it was given forth. Then shall I have my reward; and the Lord his Glory. And so shall return to my Tent, and enter into the hole of the Rock, where safetie is to be found, till the indignation be overpast, and in the endless unchangable love of God, do I Salute you, and bid you Farewel in the Lord. Yorke 10th. 2d. Month 1679. Mary Waite. Let this be Read in Friends meetings, when they are ga∣thered together, in the fear of the Lord, and in his weigh∣tie avoy. Life.
