The Certain Predictions of the Great ALCOS, Astrologer and Mathematician in Ordinary to the Duke of Parma, upon the Two Comets which have Appeared in our Hemisphere 1681, AFTER having diligently Considered the Course of the Planets, made Observations upon the Malignant Influences of the Stars, and passed whole Nights in Contemplation of the Comet which Appeared in the Hea∣vens, in the Close of the Evening, and of that which Appeared in the Morning before Break of Day; And having Considered by the Rules of Astrology, That the Evening Comet entring into Capricorn, and going out by the Scorpions Tayl, which extends it self 800 Leagues, threatens a Ge∣neral Plague, Terrible Earthquakes, and Prodigious Thunders, by which se∣veral Towns in Christendom will be swallowed up and laid in Ashes. The Comet which Appears in the Morning, having Cancer Reverst underneath it, visibly declares that the Angel Abiron, Punisher of the Sins of the World hath a Sword drawn for the destruction of a Maritine Prince, who hath drawn on himself the just Anger of God, but that the Presence of the Sun which hides this Angry and Fiery Comet from our Sight, assures us, That the Religious Valour of the Knights of Maltha, encouraged by the extra∣ordinary Zeal of our Holy Father the Pope, will appease the God of Mercy and Bounty, and that their Armes will be so Victorious over the Turks, that their Success shall amaze all the World. The approaching Summer shall be dry so long, that the greatest Rivers shall be dried up, and the Ground so hot, that the Beasts, Serpents and other Animals, shall be forced to come out of their Dens and Holes; And Men shall be Af∣flicted with burning Feavers, Swellings and bloody Fluxes. The Ram ascending towards Libra shews us, That the last year in the Month of Au∣gust, the Mart is entred into the Barr before Gri Riere after shews, that in April of this present year the Sovereign Abesse of Franconia shall be delivered of a Son, which shall neither be of Cap nor Ville, but of Mart and of Rig, who shall be an Astrologer in our Dutchy of Parma, and shall one day be acknowledged Prince of Franconia. The 22 July Mars following at the Heels of Sagittary with his Dart, we may expect so general a Hail, that it will be very prejudicial to all Grain that is not gotten in; And Bacchus will be so afflicted, that he exhorts his good Children not idly to empty all the Vessels this year. In fine, Heaven is so angry, and the whole World so laden with Sins, Disorders and A∣bominations, that Nature her self shall be ready to Expire, and the Earth hold as it were but by a Thread▪ Vices, as Ambition, Jealousie, Envy, Impiety, and Irreligion of all Nations ingeneral, and every Man in particular have drawn down the just Anger of God upon us Europe will fall quickly; I know no Estate whose Ruine we may not fear. This Age perhaps shall be the last of all Empires, and (may be) we shall hear, That the Universe is at its End; All Mountains shall be brought low, the Alpes shall be Thun∣der-stricken, the Pireneans beaten down and levelled; The Sins of Men are grown so great, and their Disorders so Monstrous and Prodigious, that we may well expect to see this last Moment, if we Repent not, and Mortifie our selves; which only can A∣vert the severity of these terrible Judgments of God. God through his Love to us doth show, By th' Stars what he intends to do; That thereby knowing his Intent, We may of our ill Works Repent. According to the Original Printed at Parma by John Zapate.
