AN ADMONITION TO MY LORD PROTECTOR AND HIS COUNCIL, Of their present Danger, WITH The means to secure him and his POSTERITY in the present Greatnesse: With the generall Ap∣plause and lasting Tranquility of the NATION, London, Printed in the Yeer 1654.
THE PREFACE. MY LORD, MY passionate inclinations to the lasting peace of my Countrey, have made me so presumptuous, as to prescribe to your High∣ness and Council a more perfect remedy for its ill healed wounds, than I have seen yet applied: But I would not be thought so im∣pudent, as to offer at the instruction of so great Masters in the Art of Government, but onely to put you in mind of those things, that the multiplicity of your greater Affairs have made you for∣get to consider. And lest your Highness should want leasure to peruse the papers of an obscure and unknown person, I thought fit to commit them to the Press, that some of your Council or Friends (at least) may inform your Highness how much is pertinent in them, not doubting but you will think those more your friends, that give you a timely notice of your own and your Countreys danger, than those, who by a servile flattery, becalm you to your ruine; which none shall be more ambitious to prevent, then My Lord, Your most humble, and faithfull Servant, J. H.
AN ADMONITION TO MY LORD PROTECTOR, and his Council, of their present danger, &c. TO begin such a businesse as this methodically, we are first to shew the just Exceptions the people and Souldiery have to this plausible elective form of Government, so well intended by your High∣nesse and Councill; next those to your persons, with the dangers ensuing thereupon to your selves and the Nation: And lastly, the onely means of a totall and lasting prevention. And I must ingenuously confesse, that there is so much seem∣ing reason to preferre the continuall Election of wise and gal∣lant men, before the Succession of Kings or Protectors, who may possibly prove Children, or Fools, or Tyrants or Cow∣ards, that it may seem a wonder that the experience of all Na∣tions hath not driven them to the specious forme of Elective Monarchies. But the tryals they have had, have beaten them to the contra∣ry; for though the renown of your Highness's many victories and great abilities, with your long and prosperous prepossession of the Generalship, did silence the ambitious pretences of any Com∣petitours in your Election, yet we must no more look for a man that hath no Equals after your Highnesse; for the most eminent sort of men, are as near of a size in wit and courage, as they are in stature; and as they are equals in virtue, so will they be in interest, at least their factions will be so near an equality, that the weak∣er in an Army may by his cunning and industry draw in other factions from amongst the people to increase his numbers upon the common specious pretences of a Reformation in Religion
and Government agreeable to those peoples humours whom he courts, and so prepare himself to decide his pretentions by a Ci∣vil War, which I may justly call the great Sea of calamities that swallows up all the streams of other petty tyrannies, as not worth a name, in respect of the ruinous inundations of that many headed Monster, which commonly ushers in a Forraigner with it to make our miseries almost immortall. And that this is like to be our sad fate upon the Election of eve∣ry Protector, is as certain, as that all men (whether honest, or dishonest) have naturally an ambition to get as much power as they can to oblige or disoblige; and considering how naturall men overvalue themselves, I think the designs of ambitious men to be commonly just in their own thoughts, out of the Confidence they have of themselvs, of excelling others in good Government. But that those gallant men who run so many hazards to build up your Highnesse greatnesse, should not adventure as far for themselves apart, after your Highnesse death, were the greatest miracle that I have known. And to confirm this by an ancient example or two, of the wisest and most civillized people then in reputation in the world; we will begin with the great Alexander, who at his death (it seems intending an Election amongst themselves) told his great Officers, that he would leave his Empire to the worthiest; but they could so ill agree who that was, that they divided that in∣vincible Army, and each seizing upon what he could, fought it out, till they were all destroyed but Seleucu: and Ptolomy: And so after the death of Julus Caesar, was the Roman Empire rent by the dissentions of Augustus, Anthony, and Lepidus, till the fortune of Augustus prevailed. And in the declining of the Roman Empire there were severall times as many Emperours as the Legions in severall Provinces were pleased to set up, which were sometimes three or four together for want of a due succession. And to come home to the present German Empire, though it be in effect Hereditary to the House of Austria yet the very pre∣tence to a free election was the principall Cause of calling in the King of Sweden, and reducing that strong and flourishing Empire to such a wildernesse as now it is. And doubtlesse, all Governments were to be rejected as pernitious tyrannies, were it not for avoiding the tyrannie of Confusion, which subjects the Lives and Fortunes of every particular man to any small num∣ber of Rogues that shall assemble at such a time of Liberty. If then the publick peace be the chief end of all Governments,
those Forms must needs be the worst which are most subject to decline to Factions, though they do not immediately do so; and of Monarchies no doubt but the elective is most liable to this Confusion. And though it may be objected, that the follies of a weak he∣reditary King may introduce the same inconvenience, I shall first answer that there is seldome such a King; for their extraordinary educations make them knowing men, if it findes them not such. But if he be a fool, or coward, he hath subjects under him fit to command Armies, and no doubt a wise Council of his prede∣cessors, who knows how to Humor and govern him as well as any of his fellow fools; And if he be a child, his minority most com∣monly proves peaceable, if his Title be unquestionable. But it may be said he may prove a Tyrant, and that I must confess, but so may an Elective Monarch, though he seem a lamb at his first entry, I am sure he hath more reason to be so, because he hath more of his equals or superiors in birth to fear. And if we look upon other differences of these two kinds of Kings, we shall finde the Elective King more necessitated to exhaust the people, both in respect of the charge of gaining and securing his present power, and leaving his posterity like the children of a Monarch, and so the Treasury shall be alwaies emptied into private purses, and the people a new exhausted by the next hungry Prince with his necessitous kindred and dependents. So that I must conclude that every Election doth certainly threaten the worst of evils, and that the inconveniences of a succession are farre lesse, and do very seldome happen by the concurrents of many ill accidents together. And I think this may serve for demonstration of the peoples exceptions, who judge by the pressures they feel. And now let us examine the distasts of the souldiery and people together to your Highnesse person, and I doubt we shall finde that the greater their love and admiration once was, the more is now their hatred and your Highnesse danger; for they both looked upon you as a zealous reformer not only of Tyranny, but of the very causes of it; and (though you acted beyond their reasons) they thought it was because you had more reason then they, and so with an implicite faith they expected from your Highnesse such a settle∣ment, as should recompence their great expence of blood and treasure. But after the spirir had moved you to break your Oathes of allegiance and supremacy (which you took with all the Mem∣bers at your first entrance into Parliament) and after that your trust from the two houses upon the score of the Covenant, and
since again to destroy the King, weed the Parliament, and at last ear it up by the roots, and they in the end see no other fruits of bloud and perjury, but the giving laws like a Conqueror, and im∣posing that kind of Government upon the souldiery which they have fought against, and indeed a worse: what can be feared from such a deluded Army and people, but that they should as boldly draw their swords together against a Protector, as the Presbyterians and all sorts of Independents did formerly a∣gainst the King notwithstanding their own differences in opi∣nion. Certainly they will be as little scrupulous of murthering Monarch by his own law, as one by all the Laws of the Land established, and will think your Highness as guilty of the blood∣shed of the Nation, as they once thought the King, and there is no question but the people who finde their Taxes and Dan∣gers perpetuated (which were inconsiderable when they first quarrelled with them) will be as forward to assist the souldiery, as they can wish them. And I think this general disaffection of the people was so evident to your Highnesse, before they were exasperated by the death of the King or Parliament, that you need not doubt their unanimous insurrection, if they shall be prepared and countenanced in it, when the people of single Counties ventured their lives and fortunes so freely as they did before the Kings death; where it is remarkable, that a remnant of the broken and discouraged people of Kent, with some small additions in Essex, were able to divert my Lord Fairfax's Ar∣my at Colchester three moneths together; if the Nation had been then prepared for a generall insurrection in a day, it is probable your Highnesse glories had been nipped in the bud, notwithstanding your renowned victories against the Scots at that time. But it may be asked, why the people did not shew this readinesse when the Scots with their King came to Worcester, and the Answer is, that their comming was un∣expected, and in such haste, as shewed they rather came to seek then give protection, and the for-laid designes, if there were any, were (as was then pretended) discovered: But howsoever, there was little more then was requisite for dispersing of Orders between the day of their arrivall at Worcester, and that of their defeat. But the grand Objection is, that the fear of the Common Ene∣my (the King) will alwayes keep the Souldiery at unity in their Obedience under your Highness; but I answer, that if a few of them should but resolve to murther your Highness, and
one or two more of your principall Officers, which no doubt they may easily and securely do, they would find time enough to settle any form of Government they pleased, before the Common E∣nemy (who hath neither Money, Shipping, Arms, nor Friends abroad, nor any footing in this Nation) could give them any disturbance. And how far zeal may prompt those who are reli∣gious, and the ambition of sharing the Government those of no Religion, a wise man ought to fear; but admit the King were landed, and considerable, the Souldiery very well known by experience, how welcome even particular men are that revolt to an enemy in a doubtful condition; much more great bodies, which may not onely make what advantagious conditions they please for themselves, But may impose upon him stricter limi∣tations of his power, than your Highness is now tied to by your Protectorship, and no doubt may retain any places of be∣nefit or strength they shall then be possessed of, for security of performance of conditions. But if the worst should happen, that he should come in a Conquerer without their help, they know that a few of the great Ones will onely be punished; for reason will lead any conquering Tyrant (for his own security) to sweet∣en the multitude with a general pardon and Act of Oblivion; and for any scruples they may have of betraying your High∣ness Trust, I doubt they will be wiped away by their appre∣hensions of your first breaking yours with King, Parliament, and Army, and so they may probably render you a bloody re∣quitall for the destruction of their Fellow souldiers, whom you call Levellers. Lastly, Consider the fondnesse of the people to their Old Forms of Religion, as well as Government, which you have abolished without giving the liberty to tender consciences they expected, and your Highness will conclude with me, that the world affords you few others than Enemies at home, and Emulators abroad: And if I have told you no∣thing but truth. I doubt not but your generosity will think me more worthy of thanks then any of your Flatterers, especially if I propose a just, safe, and honourable remedy for the mischiefs that threaten your Highness and the Nation. And now having sufficiently opened the wounds, I shall apply the promised Cure. And it is not the lessening of your Highnesse in any thing, for I am one of those that believe Monarchy to be the best form of Government, so as it be hereditary: for admit a Mo∣narch be a Tyrant, his Tyranny is mortal, and his care will be greater not to offend, than of a multitude of Governors,
who may lay faults upon one another, and are as subject to cru∣elty and avarice as the single person, so that it is better to be preyed upon by one Family with its dependents, than by three or four hundred with theirs, and we may easier please the one, and have justice of him, than of the slow and factious great Body, who must most of them joyn to oblige, and yet any one can by his mis-information disobliege, because the accused shall be branded with the Title of a Malignant, when they have not so much as leisure to hear him. And since an arbi∣trary power will be in all Governments in those that have the possession of the Militia, it is better both for defence and offence, that the General and civil Magistrate should be all one, than that a gallant Army and Nation should be ruined, as Hanni∣bal and his Carthaginians were by the delatory and malicious practises of Hanno, a Senator with his faction. But to return to our purpose for the satisfaction of all in∣terests, and first for the souldiery, because they have fought hard for it, I should propose to your Highnesse to have all officers of the Army above the degree of Captaines to have votes in your Highnesse Councill of State at those times that they are free from their more urgent imployments in the field. So will each souldier of the Army be sure to endea∣vour by his extraordinary deserts to rise by degrees to the State preferment he sees his officers so justly rewarded with. Then for this next Parliament (though they should not have power to alter the Government) I could wish your Highnesse and Councill would consult with them about your late establishment, and hear what objections they have against it. And if the Parliament and Army should joyn in a pe∣tition to this purpose, I presume you would not deny it. And it were better to offer at acts of Grace before they were asked. Lastly, if my reasons for an hereditary Monarchy be satisfa∣ctory, I most humbly beseech your Highnesse and Council to con∣sider whether the establishment of the succession after your High∣nesse in an usurping line, will not expose the Nation to all the miseries I have mentioned in an elective government, and if this be doubted, be pleased to look over our own Chronicles, and you shall find variety of examples, without going further then the time of the conquest. For first, Harrold by his usurpa∣tion encouraged and occasioned the Conquest of England; then was there another deluge of blood occasioned by the usurpa∣tion
of Henry the first; and again what slaughters and rapines did this miserable Nation endure by the unjust ambition of King Stephen in detaining the Crown from Maud the Empresse, which fire could not be quenched but by the succession of her son the right heir, which was at last agreed to by King Stephen. But to come nearer home, you shall find that Henry the fourth saw his country bleed in his life-time for his usurpation, though he came in with the generall good liking of the people, and thought he ha secured himself by the Kings murther. But though his industry secured the Crown to his son, yet was his sons death conspired by his principall friends just as he was setting out for the invasion of France; but that conspiracy being detected, he by his unparallelled vertues and successes and the weaknesse of the true heir, avoided during his short life any storms at home. But they fell most heavily upon our flou∣rishing Countrey in his Successor Henry the sixths time who could never have lost the Crown by his weaknesse if his title had been good; as appeareth by the notable contention be∣tween him and Edward the fourth, but between them were many thousands of Orphans and widows left weeping over their own and their Countreys desolate and bloudy ruines; and at last the ambition of Henry the fourth was justly pu∣nished in the ruine of his Grandchild, and a hatefull memo∣ry for his unjust Ambition and the sad consequences of it. But if these examples do not sufficiently convince, the reason of the thing doth, for there will alwayes be a conscientious and a necessitous party for the true heir in any Nation against an Usurper; besides malecontents which are still the greatest num∣ber because many must necessarily be injured, and more unre∣warded that think they deserve it, and even all men that are un∣concerned will be for the true Heir, and be pretended lovers of Justice, and with much reason must hate presidents of wrong, least they should time other time suffer it. And so I may conclude we are as certain of a civill warre from an unjust succession as from an Elective Government. And the incomparable miseries and ill consequences of that I have al∣ready declared, though our own experience might partly have saved me the labour. But your Highnesse may think an in∣vincible Fleet a sufficient security for an Island against a For∣reign Nation that may interpose at such a time of our destructions. But I answer, that if none of your shipping should revolt, yet might our next neighbours the French (if
they should then make peace with their other enemies) take the opportunity of the same storm that shall force your Fleet in the Winter into Harbors to blow them over the short pas∣sage into England, if they have any party to secure their Landing here. But if this be thought frivolous, I suppose I have said e∣nough besides to make it appear that the true interest of your Highnesse and your posterity with that of this Kingdome to think of a treaty with Charles Stuart, if he will accept of the Crown after your decease upon the same terms you now hold it, I mean the same Councill and limitation of power, with a competent maintenance for him in the mean time, in some such remote place as you shall need lesse to fear him then you do now, if he should incline to the breach of such an agree∣ment, as may be secured by Oaths, Hostages, and by the me∣diation of such States whose interest it is (in respect of their greater neighbours) to be alwayes friends to the peace of Eng∣land, and by stricter ties then are here necessary to be men∣tioned; besides the honesty, discretion and temper of the young man, who (notwithstanding his great courage) shews he in∣herits the mildnesse of his Father and Grandfather on the one side, and of his Mother and Grandfather on the other side, which great King Henry the fourth of France after he had victoriously broken the heart of that great Rebellion called the Catholique League, notwithstanding received the only head of it then living the Duke of Main, into his protection and favour, and never took the least revenge of him or any o∣ther of that Rebellious crew in all the time of his reign. But above all things the Kings own interest and the good of his Countrey will oblige him to bury his resentments, and both to accept and keep such conditions as redeem him and his follow∣ers from misery at the present, and secure him and his posteri∣ty in the end to the re-enjoyments of all their rights, without the slaughter or destruction of any part of his Kingdomes, which he is most tenderly sensible of; and what doubt can there be but that he will rather expect quietly the decease of an old man (as your Highnesse is) then run an improbable ha∣zard of all his fortunes for a few years, which he must have stayed for till his fathers death, if he had not been untimely cut off: and that he was willing to do so, your Highness knowes, by his pious and earnest sollicitation then to you and the rest of the officers then with you for the saving of his
life. And let me ad a very late tryal of him, when Wiseman and o∣thers proposed your murther to him, he refused to consent to it, notwithstanding his interest, and the exasperation of his wants; how then should he be feared when those motives are taken away? But admit this were not so, you have, still all the power in your own hands, and would have the affections of the people (which he now hath) if he should be perfidious to their disquiet anew. If then it be clear that you are secure on the Kings side, where lies the danger of this accommodation? it is the un∣doubted interest of the military men to be alwaies governed by a Monarch, especially if they be well provided of subordinate places under him, and the people are so passionately affected to the old line, as their onley constant security from rapine and bloudshed, that they will never be at rest till they have an oportunity to destroy the rooter up of that three great fen∣ces, of their Religion, Laws, and that unquestionable succes∣sion which would intirely secure them from any more disputes; and even most of those who formerly fancyed, better forms of Government, are now for falling into the old channel, out of dispair of drawing the peoples affections to their fancies, without which they know the peace of the Nation can never be long preserved; if your Highnesse should yet prove one of that number, your name would be as good as it is great; for a man may be thought reasonably to undertake indirect courses for a great and publick good, so as he leave those courses when he sees his end is not to be compassed: And if your Highness do so, your curses will be turned into praises, and you may sleep again without any fear of your own guards, who otherwise are not like to scruple the murthering of so unjust a master for a greater reward than you can give them, if the present seizure of your treasure were not sufficient for them: For men of no Religion will at any tine betray a person as wicked as themselves for their interest, and those that are zealous will do the same upon the score of Justice, and their Oaths and Covenants to other forms or persons; so that your Highness can be secure of no body, nor any thing, but the rewards of injustice with infamy, for the preferring your Sons advancement before your Countreys secu∣rity, who if he were planted can never be secured by any De∣crees or Oaths, since both have been so commonly broken, and ought to be so, if unjustly made or taken; and if his vir∣tues be never so great his meer youth shall make him be despised by
those that have had the start of him in successes, and the af∣fections of the Army; and the seeming respect that is now paid him upon your Highness score, shall vanish with your death, and all your Family be destroyed (like that of the great Alexanders) by your own friends and followers, if you your self should scape such a cup of poyson as he met with on such a dagger as finished the ambition of Julius Caesar: And now my Lord, for a Conclusion, give me leave to wonder at the am∣bition of all ill men, though they belive in no other world, since their ambition is to gain esteem, and how they should be esteem∣ed and hated at once for the same fact, I know not, without a contradiction. If they did but consider how even wicked men hate one another for fear of receiving the same injuries from their companions which they have inflicted together upon others, they would prefer the love and admiration of Mankind before the being admirably hated, which since your Highnesse may so easily do, and cannot with justice, honour and safety do any thing else, it shall no more be doubted from your generosity by MY LORD.
