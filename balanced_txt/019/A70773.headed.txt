A New SONG: OR, The Old Womans Wish. To the Tune of the Old Mans Wish. .I SInce Beauty now fails And I find I decay, Let this be my Wish; In a Chimney not gay, May I have a warme corner And a Bench that's compleat And a cleanly young Wench To sweep the Hearth neat. May I govern the Young By my wholesome advice; And as older, grow nearer To be Stil'd prophetess; Without pride, yet my name Than the Sibills not less II. In a Garden that's furnish'd With herbs for the Still, And a bed of choice Sallets, Which I weed at my will; With a spacious Meade, And a delicate Cow And an Arbour to set And heare Colly to low. May I govern the Young &c. III. With a boild Chick on Sunday, And a Dumpling that's soft, And a full teeming Jug, With a motto that Oft May have puzzled the learnd, By the Old Sages writ; Which in Letters of blew, Is stain'd round about it. May I govern the Young &c. IV. With a Book of Feat tales, And pleasant Old Story's And riddles by Saxons made Long lived before us: With a dish of Minc'd Meat, Or Pigs Pettitoes; No gristles nor Brawn, To give dangerous blows. May I govern the Young &c. V. With a Conscience untainted, May I pass my last day, And when I am gon, May the good Women say In the Morning at mattens, In the E'en at her Ale, She's gon, and he's happy Can tell out her tale: For she govern'd the Young By her wholesome advice; And as older grew nearer, To be stil'd prophetess; Without pride, yet her name Then the Sibils not less. By S P. LONDON, Printed by G. Croom, over against  Baynard's Castle in Thames-street. 1684.
