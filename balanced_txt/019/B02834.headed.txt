The WHIG's Exaltation; A Pleasant New SONG of 82. To an Old Tune of 41. Now Now the Tories all shall stoop, Religion and the Laws, and Whigs on Commonwealth Get up to Tap the Good Old Cause; Tantivy-Boys shall all go down, And haughty Monarchy; The Leathern Cap shall brave the Throne; Then Hey Boys up go We. [2] When once that Anti christian Crew Are crush'd, and Overthrown, We'l teach the Nobles how to bow, And keep their Gentry down; Good Manners has a bad Repute, And tends to Pride we see; We'l therefore cry all Breeding down, And Hey Boys up go We. [3] The Name of Lord shall be Abhor'd, For ev'ry Man's a Brother; What Reason then in Church or State One Man should Rule another? Thus having Pill'd and Plunder'd all, And Level'd each Degree, We'l make their plump young Daughters fall, And Hey Boys up go We. [4] What though the KING and Parliament Cannot accord together, We have good Cause to be Content, This is Our Sun-shine Weather; For if good Reason should take place, And they should both agree, 'Dzowns who'd be in a Round-heads Case, For Hey then up go We? [5] We'l down with all the Versities Where Learning is Profest; For they still Practice, and Maintain The Language of the Beast; We'l Exercise in every Grove, And Preach beneath a Tree; We'l make a Pulpit of a Tub, Then Hey Boys up go We. [6] The Whigs shall Rule Committee Chair, Who will such Laws Invent, As shall Exclude the Lawful Heir By Act of Parliament: We'l cut His Royal Highness down, E'en shorter by the Knee, That He shall never reach the Throne, Then Hey Boys up go We. [7] We'l Smite the Idol in Guild-Hall, And Then (as we were wont,) We'l cry it was a Popish Plot, And Swear those Rogues have don't; His Royal Highness to Unthrown Our Interest will be, For if He e're Enjoy His own, Then Hey Boys up go We. [8] We'l break the Windows which the Whore Of Babylon has Painted; And when their Bishops are pull'd down, Our Elders shall be Sainted: Thus having quite Enslav'd the Throne, Pretending to set Free, At last the Gallows claims its own, Then Hey Boys up go We. LONDON, Printed by Nath. Thompson Anno Domini, 1682.
