A Briefe DISCOVRSE VPON TYRANTS AND TYRANNY. TYrannie may justly bee esteemed the greatest calamity, be∣cause it is in opposition to the chiefest felicity which es in liberty, and the free disposition of that which God and our own industry hath made ours; Nor can it keep company with goodnesse, since it destroyes the first true principle of justice, by which all are injoyned to doe by others as they desire others should deale by them. Tyrannie is most commonly taken for the irregularity of him that governs in chiefe, who only rules according to will; for in subordinate instruments it is called oppression: And under this title it caused the ruine of the first world, as it doth now of all corporations where it is suffered too much to abound. If it be asked, whether this extravagant or a legall jurisdiction be most na∣turall and convenient for a King. It may most truly be answered, the later: For if it be certaine that the strength of a King lies in the riches and love
of his people: I am sure, he they are least afraid of, hath the greatest share; for who can heartily affect him they doubt. Where laws are observed, the wicked onely tremble, but Tyranny is equally formidable both to good and bad, yet it cannot be so safe in the Army it must have to guard it; as a good Prince is between mercy and justice. It may appeare by Lucian, that a reward was anciently assigned to him that should kill a Tyrant, out of the common treasury; which proves them enemies to the State; And hee that renders himselfe worthy of this title, can have no hope to satisfie his conscience, nor safety to assure his fears, being as deep in the hatred of God as he is in the detestation of men. When a power is raised against him, he is lost with the first battell, not be∣ing able to appeare againe in the Field, because his strength only consists in such souldiers as are used to pay and rapine; (which at this time faile them, the one being exhausted by his former profusion, and the later prevented by his enemies care) and not in his subiects, who have (in a well governed Common-wealth) the strong engins of private interests to move them; Whereas these mercenaries look only after present profit which doth of ne∣cessity conclude with his felicity, knowing they can never want Masters so long as ambition reignes in the world, which makes them (like the spirits of Conjurers) serve them during the dayes of their better fortune; and those ended, to be as ready as the rest to bring them to perdition, And being once disabled to keep the Field, hee remaines a prey to his Ad∣versary, unlesse hee prevent it by killing himselfe. For souldiers bred in so much liberty will never endure a straight siege, but rather buy their safety with his head, which they never valued higher than the profit could be made of it; and if the people stirre in his defence; they shew a madnesse no lesse than to be found fighting against themselves, it being unpossible to bee in harder condition; so that the hope of bettering themselves takes away all feare of loosing by the change: And if they should interpose themselves, yet they could contribute little help, because such as live under an absolute constraint are not so belliquous as natural subiects, who have something to loose, whereas these never injoyed any thing but the courtesie of another; and are so debsd by continuall injuries and oppressions, that they beare any thing with more ease and patince then Armes which they know not how to use, unlesse upon great advantage, and when they are animated with the sweet sound of liberty, for then they are found to have done wonders, pecially upon their Masters; which proceeds out of feare not valour, as
appeares by the exorbitant cruelty they use to the authors of their sub∣iection. A Tyrant being assailed, he is forced to goe against that wholsome rule of policy, which adviseth a Prince never to fight in his own Territorie, but with advantage both of time and place, for hee must meet him at first without any respit, least his own should have leasure to ioyne with the adverse party, which commonly they doe. Wee read great matters of the State and extent of the Persian Monarchy, yet Zenophon with a handfull of men cut his own passage through the middest of it; and with what ease they were after overcome, all know or may read in the Story. And as short-lived most of those governments be, the Turk only excep∣ted, who is cordeally opposed by none but the Persian, that holds his estate by the same tenure: And to this may be added the simplicity of the Turkish Nation, who place the chiefest principle of their Religion in obedience to their King, though he command thousands of them to make away them∣selves at once; so it may be said of these silly people, that they are onely daring in destroying themselves; This Princes strength lying chiefly in his Ianizaries consisting of about 40000; who being for the most part taken in the warres, or bred up from children paid for tribute, are of severall Na∣tions, and so not apt to combine; And though an infinite number of Natives goe into the Field with him, they are so slightly esteemed that they serve on∣ly to fill up Trenches and Breaches with their carkasses. Now were his own people Souldiers by nature, which law and freedome would soone make them, he need not be so fond of strangers, nor so fearefull of his owne. Yet now the Ianizaries being informed of their strength, begin to use their Master as the pretorian Souldiers did the Tyrants of Rome, for they know no inland power can refist them, which gives them the boldnesse to ca∣pitulate with their Prince, and to seli his head when they meet with a free Chapman; which makes well for Christendome, for had he not these diver∣sions, he had long ere this decided the warre in Germany by taking that from them they are together by the eares for. There is no doubt but God was able to have put spirit enough in the chil∣dren of Israel to have left Egypt without leave; or that being obtained, have turned their faces towards Pharoh in defence of their new purchased liberty; but he chose rather to bring them through the Sea, as if it were a lesse
miracle for the water to goe back, than for people bred in servitude to stnd fll before an enemy with hope of successe; And it is made more a parant after by his own choyce of the servants of the Princes of the Provinces, when hee meant to deliver his people; that such are fittest for warre who live in least feare and have sometimes quarrels amongst themselves, as these in all likelihood had. So as I may say under good authority, that since Coaches came up and Hospitality down, that England is stronger in horses but weaker in men; and if law, the ready way to every mans right, should bee quite lost, as it is in some hazzard, wee might quickly grow more basely spirited then wee are in the generality, if it be possible, for he that hath not the meanes or is not used to defend himselfe, will never protect an∣other. For supplies in a necessity, the limited government hath ever beene most free, because they know it is for their own preservation; whereas a bad Prince is then forced rather to give than take for feare his subiect, should ioyne with the enemy, who cannot chuse but be as goosefoot a better friend, especially if hee observes but halfe the conditions he offers, which are ever more tolerable than they are under: And though both be ill, yet there is some delight in the change; besides the subiects of Tyrants in the generall are not so rich, the uncertainty of keeping, hindering for the most part the desire of gaine: So though he hath the power to command all, yet when it comes together, it doth not rise to so great a summe as such as are free borne doe willingly give. It is a saying worthy to be followed, that a wise man if he cannot keep out a Tyrant, will bee the first to bring him in: yet it must be taken with such limitations and resistance, as may be iustified by honour and probity as well as by policy and wisdome; for hee that shall lend his hand to the raising or maintaining such a Monster, out of no other reason then private respect cannot bee guilty of lesse treason then the crossing Gods intentions, who never made the glorious Nations of this world to serve only as foot∣balls for Kings to kick up and down according as their wanton and unbridled passions move them. Yet if Cato had been as wise as Brutus, Rome might have stopt this plague before it had gained all the people; for if to die with a friend be a signe of love, it is a farre greater to see him revenged, and his issue raised to their lost liberty: Thus Bruins did, who kept his life safe under the habite of folly, till hee found hee might expose it with profit to his Countrey, whilst
the other flung it away in the midst of dispaire, when the State had use of living friends not dead carkasses; had he met the Monster and kist him, hee had continued his feares, whereas this good mans making away himselfe left him secure. The Bible that is an enemy to indiscretion, commends rather than blames David that was mad in shew, but ato was so indeed, else why would be not have ventured to kill the common enemy with his own hands? which might have been done with more justice, and at the worst with no lesse losse then of his own life; therefore it may be conceived it was not zeale to his Countrey but passion made him do it; for if the destruction of few governments can be more uninst than their beginning, why should a man desperately expose his life to maintain any title that hath lost the old force that was wont to support it? This being a conclusion in Divinity, that the strongest power is to be obeyd. For all this I doe not think it wisdome to stand by and look on, for he that hath faithfully maintained his faction, though he be overcome is likelier to finde friendship and forgivenesse than hee that hath been a Neuter, in which state hee hath no power to shew his valour or fidelity, which ever renders the owner capable of love and piety. Neither can I think him so highly to bee commended, that without con∣sideration of possibility of successe, is resolved to stand to a falling pillar, and to perish with it, no more than he that upon as little assurance mingles with the common rabble, which are the rocks on whom great pretenders venture their ambition; and when the battell is wonne and lost, have no other reward for the most part, than the bitter repentance of their folly which hath rather impaired than bettered their condition. And if Reason in any case can warrant the breaking of this rule, it must be for the defence of Liberty; for the difference betweene one absolute Prince and another, in respect the best are mortall and subiect to ill Counsell, cannot be worth so much blood as a crabbed Title requires to decide it; therefore they that have not the skill to live without a Master, must welcome him that comes in with least trouble, who being secure may be the easier expeld upon the peoples dislike. I have heard reported for the honour of the Protestant Religion, that they never attempted any thing against their Prince, whih may be said at more ease than proved, as appeares both by the French and Dutch Histo∣ries: I am so farre from taking this as a disparagement, that I think it may well be justfied where strength and number affords a probability of successe,
it being ridiculous to maintaine, a man may not doe as much to save his conscience, as all Law allowes him for the defence of his purse and estate: and those that rely so much upon Saint Paul in the contrary opinion, doe not remember his Master, who saith there are times wherein a sword is more necessary than a coat, which ought to be sold to purchase it; and he that carries not the sword in vaine, himselfe would not burthen his followers with an uselesse weapon. During the Reigne of the Heathen Emperours it was a crafie time in the Church, and therefore the Professors were taught patience, because the body was not strong enough to purge it selfe. He that stands still whilst a weaker than he kills him, is as guilty of his owne death as he that hangs himselfe. Religion may be above Reason in matters of Faith, but not against it in manners, and the meanes of our pre∣servation, which are wisedome and strength joyned with prayers for a good successe. And if this be denied, it will not only discourage us that are Protestants already, but keep out others that would come in; for who that is to chuse will take that Religion that shall make it damnable to defend it selfe, and so destroy one of the strongest principles of nature. Saint Paul seeing the company halfe Pharisees, halfe Saduces, takes this opportunity and proclaimes himselfe of one of the factions, and by this meanes rescued his life: Nay Christ himselfe, when the Iewes sought to entangle him in his speech, proposeth the question of Iohn the Baptist to set them in opposition with the people, the love of whom was all the earthly strength he had, as appeares by the Gospel. Did not Abraham teare his brother Lot out of the hands of the King that detained him, by the perswasion of love and naturall affection. I doe not beleeve that all those took the Protestants part either in France or the Low∣countreys, did it out of zeale to Religion, more than some that opposed them: But in such cases discretion makes use of all lawfull advantages; and if Tyranny be overthrowne, the meanes can hardly be capable of reproofe, and no Tyranny is so great as that which is exercised over mens consciences. In the primitive time the Christians served in great troops under the Hea∣then Emperours, but whether they had altogether beene able to establish their owne conditions, all reason makes me doubt: Besides, true Religion was to be planted, and we see patience gaines at the beginning more Prose∣lytes, than either force or prosperity. But now our work is only to defend
it: All must confesse, that the Protestants have not yet had the leisure or will to act such bloody and dark treasons as the Papists, what they have done hath beene hitherto bravely with their swords in their hands, the natu∣rall and generous way of deciding a controversie. But if against this the Duke of Guise be obiected, I answer, hee was none of their Prince, next, that he was condemned by the greatest part of the Kingdom as a man unworthy to live, being thought the cause of most of the ill France did then labour with, this being apparant to every judge∣ment; therefore what was done to him was only the execution of a just sen∣tence which so great a Iury had pronounced against him; yet it cannot be proved that they did it, though it matters not much. Christ tells Pilate, if his Kingdome had beene of this world, that is suf∣ficiently beleeved, his subiects would have fought for him, by which hee seemes to me silently to upbraid the cowardlinesse of his followers. I know the Romans by Tyrants, meant ill Kings, so doe not I, who only comprehend under this title such as encroach upon the just liberties of their subiects; for a true King is he that watcheth over his Countrey for their ge∣nerall good, acknowledging the particular propriety every one hath in what he enioyes ought not to be violated but where law allowes, and ne∣cessity compells. If it be pleasure a King seeks, Law barres him not, but preserves him more safe in a wilde Forrest, than the Grand Signior can be in his Seragleo, or when he goes his progresse with an hundred thousand men: or if he de∣lights in things lesse honest, Law only informes him by punishing of others for the same faults, that he which is set out of the reach of her power ought to be a Law to himselfe. To conclude, I ever beleeved that the maine scope of those rules for pa∣tience and sufferance, prescribed in holy writ, extend onely to restraine the unbridled passions of over furious men, and to perswade temperance in the tongue and hands, when there is no sufficient power to make resistance; neither doe I like this opinion the worse, because it is maintained by Bellar∣mine and the rest of the Iesuites, that having most probability of truth, that is consonant to all parties. For it is no lesse than madnesse to think that God that hath allotted a punishment for all faults, should protect this which is the greatest, because it destroyes the principles of the second table, and hinders the performance of those of the first; there being no stronger ene∣my to Religion than unsetled feare: For how can the Word have a free
passage when the Churchmen have nothing to protect them, when they tell the King of his implety, and the Nobles of their transgression. So then Tyranny cannot agree with the joyfull tidings of the Gospel, which desires the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Now where Law, Religion, and the Love of the People are, it makes a threefold cord, not easily broken, which drawes on plenty, peace, and prosperity. And if such a Prince comes to be invaded, he is commonly the last that suffers, when a Tyrant is ever the first. FINIS.
