A Translate of a LETTER FROM Don Lewis de Harro Chief Counsellor and Minister of State to his Majesty of Spaine sent unto the King of Scots at Brussels concerning the affaires in England, publication of the Articles of Peace and Marriage with France, &c. May it please your Majesty, SInce it hath pleased the Almighty Lord thus to blesse and crown your Majesty with pati∣ence in long sufferings, in which you have been a strict observer of those graces, precepts and qualities so eminent in your Royal Father, that even his and your greatest enemies are driven to confess, that amidst the multitude of your thoughts (as the Psalmist de∣livers it) Gods comforts doth delight your soul, And whilest evil men who are the tor∣mentors in this life solace themselves with all your earthly pleasures, it is your greatest care to preserve and keep unto your self the Testimony of a good conscience, which will ever surmount and triumph above all the adversities of this lower world, and at last that furious zeal which hath now Dominion in your Kingdoms, will burn, and as a Canker at the root of their hopes shall destroy your op∣posers; from hence great Sir, the Nations murmure, and your faith in those long sufferings gives you firm hopes that the day of your Redemption is nigh, for this never fails in the consent of all Nations, vox po∣puli, vox Dei: And therefore since God hath shewed unto the people a mark of his high displeasure by your Exile, they are upon return, by which your Majesty is encouraged to say Amen. But this is not altogether my Affair, The transact promulgation of the Articles of Peace and Marriage with his Ma∣jesty of France is unalterably true, And what therein concerns your Majestie is also decreed, as I hope hath already in part appeared by the present Forces of your own Subjects drawn out by your Majesties Servants, and if need require there is other helps designed for you, yet finding an unwillingnesse in your Councel to Alarm your Countries with Forraigners (if possibly avoided) I must forbear to urge the kindnesse of my Master, otherwise there had been a freedom answerable to your Majesties (I am sorry that I have occasion to say) necessities, which indeed is rather a shame to your own Subjects, of whom the Heathens can with some remorse discourse, and amongst the Christians under his Catholick Ma∣jestie (although there wants union with you in matters of religious worship) you are pitied in that the foundation is laid in Christ our Lord; Let your enemies therefore feare and tremble as in the pre∣sence of the Lord, for the justnesse of your cause heightens my belief of their Astonishment. And were it not for their present interest in ill gotten goods; I dare positively affirm there were no Enemie to give you battel, but the wonder is at an end in that such as these are foretold by that unerring Spirit in the Prophets and Apostles, which saith, That Covetousnesse is the root of all evil. In conclusion the for∣wardnesse of this dispatch is occasioned through great desires of yeelding any thing which may contri∣bute to your Majesties consolation: Pure and intire affections are pardonable, although hastilie scat∣tered before Princes, and in confidence of that I can as well hope for as plead my excuse. His Majesties Congratulations followed with all the Ambassadors, Councellors, Commanders, Ministers of State, and Monsiur Le Prince are amply in this expresse declared as a demonstration of great joy for your Ma∣jesties hopeful Restauration: And that your successe may fill the world with admiration, and convince all Subjects of that sin, is the prayer of him who is in great truth, 1659. Your Majesties most humble and faithful servant, Lewis de Harro.
