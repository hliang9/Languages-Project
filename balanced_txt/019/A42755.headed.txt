Rests due to George Gil from the Common-wealth to ballance the Account— 46. 0. 1. THe Parliament by an Ordinance of Novemb. 24. 1642. enabled Ferdinando Lord Fairfax, to receive Money, Plate, Horse, and Armes upon the Propositions, for which the Publique Faith was to be engaged. Col. Gill upon that Ordinance lent Ferdinando Lord Fairfax 60. li. upon the Publique Faith, aud raised a Troop of Horse compleatly armed with Swords, Pistolls, Back, Breast, and Pot, wherein he disbursed 600. li. a great part of which Monies he borrowed upon Interest. Col. Gill served under the command of the Lord Fairfax as Captain, and Major of Horse, untill his Arrears amounted unto 1657. li. 16.s. 3.d. The Parliament by Ordinance of the 22 May, 1647. provides for the payment of one third of the Arreares of the Northerne Officers, to be accepted by them for the whole in full satisfaction. Col. Gill one of those Officers, his Accompts being audited, and so stated, that the 600. li. advanced by him in Horse and Arms upon the Publique Faith, was accompted amongst his Arrears, was then in a straight, conceiving that the Parliament intended not to give one third in full for his Money lent, yet being in necessity for monies by reason of his losses in serving the Parliament, was willing to accept of one third in full for his Arrears, and to receive one third of his 600. li. lent, but not for satisfaction; therefore upon the 27 of May, before he took an Assignement for any money, five dayes after the said Ordinance passed, he petitioned the Committee of the Northern Association, shewing that he could not accept of one third for the whole of his 600. li. lent, and that the Ordinance mentioned only Arrears, and desired that his Case, with his losses and sufferings, might be represented to the Parlia∣ment; the Committee ordered, That his Petition should be reported to the Parliament. Thereupon Col. Gill received his Petition and Accompts from the Clerke of the Committee (as appeares by a Note of the Clerks hand) and put them into the hands of Mr. Bryan Stapleton to report to the Parliament, as he hath already testified. After two years expectation of reparations for his losses and sufferings, and the 400. li. the remaining two thirds of his 600. li. lent money, the Act of Parliament passed for doubling upon Deans and Chapters Lands, and Col. Gill was advised, and did beleeve, that without offence he might double the money that he had lent upon the Publique Faith, and he did double the 400. li. (the two remaining thirds of the 600. li. lent in Horses and Armes) which with the Interest allowed, amounted to 600. li. NOw if any conceives that Col. Gill hath gained by the Common-wealths Service in receiving one third of his Arreares, and Troop, and doubling two thirds of his 600 li. lent in Horses and Armes with Interest, hee humbly offers the abovesaid Ac∣compt, That by his receiving one third of his Arreares and Troop, (whereof he lost 387 li.) by the Parliaments transferring the same from the Excise to Deans and Chapters Lands, and by his doubling the two thirds of his Troop, and Interest for the same, he never yet received in money his 660 li. lent upon the Publique Faith. Col. Gill humbly craves your favour to consider, That he hath been a constant sufferer for the Parliament from the beginning of the War to this day, and hath upon his credit advanced great sums of Money for their Service, and lost his Estate and Calling which was, and would have been of great advantage to him, and he desires that he may not be ruined in his attendance upon your Honours, he having waited near nine Moneths after a heavy sentence given against him, and nothing can more certainly ruin him and his Family then a further long attendance, under the sentence given against him; He beseeches you therefore that the report of his Case now resting in the hands of Col. Downes may be speedily heard, and he humbly hopes he may yet be thought ca∣pable of doing further service for the Common wealth. GEORGE GILL▪
