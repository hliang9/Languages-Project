A RELATION OF THE Strange Apparition OF THE Five JESUITS Lately Executed at Tyburn upon the Account of TREASON. Being a wonderful Token of their Disquiet, and some Things considerable referring to their Guilt. Discovered to Two Gentlemen of Eminent Credit, upon the Road between London and Acton, Travelling for Chippenham in Wiltshire. Closed up with an Ingenious and Merry Picce of History, concerning No Jesuits in Hell. THE Appearance of the Deceased has always been admired, and enqui∣red into by men of the best Learning and Consideration, but especially when the men whose Persons have been represented, have left the World in a dubious, strange or terrible manner, as is plain in the Case in hand. God, it's true, has blest us with a better way of Instruction, than can be communicated to the World by such disputable and uncertain Shapes; but yet, when such things are, it becomes us not to slight or scorn, but make the best Improvement we can of them. But first to the Relation it self: Upon Munday the 30th. of June, Mr. Robert Loe, and Mr. Thomas Pointwell, riding upon the Road between Tyburn and Acton, (intending for a Journey to Chippenham in Wiltshirt) were met by the Appearance of one in a long Gown, at first seeming∣ly blue, but presently the nearer approach changed it into a perfect red, which calling to one of these Travellers, said, Loe, Loe, hear me; who immediately made a stand, being surprized with a great amazement upon his Spirit, for the
Apparition was so terrible, that his Courage failed him: while his Companion, who was passed on some little distance before, turning back to see for his Fellow-Traveller, discovers him surrounded with something like a flame of Fire, which looked so terrifying to Mr. Pointwell, that for some few minutes he had not a power of moving either forward or backward; but upon a little re∣collection, arguing himself into Fortitude, he rides up towards this Light, where he finds his Friend Mr. Loe in such a transport of Amazement, as not to be able to utter one word: He also then seeing the same Apparition his Friend did; be∣gan to enquire of him, what was the matter? To which immediately the Appa∣rition it self return'd some Answer, which could not by them be understood, and turned aside his changeable Gown, even to the discovery of the Body which in∣habited it, which then appear'd to be nothing but a flame of Fire. After which ascended out of the same flame, the Appearance of other four men: The first in order taken notice of, stood cloathed in a seeming black Garment, and as to Age (as near as conjecture could draw the conclusion) did appear to be about the 70th. year, very Gray-headed, and of a feeble Constitution, who breathed out a deep groan, and said, Hear me, for I am disquieted, and long to be at rest; and now the occasion of my disquiet is ripened unto a discovery: Which said, this va∣nisheth away, and three more come in sight, all having ghastly looks, not only resembling the state of Death simply considered as referring to the Body, but also a more terrible estate as referring to the Soul; these with one voice cry out, We (together with the other two that went before) are the five men lately Executed at Tyburn, upon the account of Treason against the King, for conspiring his Death, and the change of Government: Go ye therefore and acquaint the Living, That as our Life did endeavour to create, so our Death has not removed, the Dangers of Eng∣land, but they will accomplish the designed end, unless the repentance of the Nation, and conviction and care of those that sit at the Helm, give a speedy prevention. Having delivered these words with much concernedness, they all immediately disappear'd, and there only remained such a dark Fog, that the two Travellers were not able to see each other; and a Voice out of the Cloud delivered it self in this wise: The light of our Life seems at present to be put out in this visible World, but who shall quench that fire which is kindled among those dark and black Coals, which we helped to pile together under obscurity, while we conversed among the Li∣ving? for here lies the strange difficulty, a danger scarcely to be overcome. As soon as this short Speech was delivered, there did a paleness appear through the dark Cloud, and after that it became so clearly light, that these two Travellers saw each other, as also the personated Appearance of those Five Executed men, cloathed with pale Garments, who presently fell into contention about the way and manner how the Discovery of their Disquiet should be made, whether to those that rejoyced, or those that mourned at their Fall; if to those that re∣joyced, then it would confirm the being of a Popish Plot, strengthen the Prote∣stants in their ill opinion of the Romanists, and blemish their own Reputation, and make them appear to be what the World said of them, Men of turbulent and obstinate minds, such as accounted any thing to be just and good, that was once owned and projected by them, though never so treacherous, vile and base; if discovered to those that mourned at their Fall, then it would either aggra∣vate their sorrow into a long debate, what to do with their Principles which were so much questioned after the dying state, so hazardous to Peace and Ease in the invisible World; or else it would make them suddenly leave their way of Profession, as hateful and to be declined by all those that have any inclination to be at Ease and Rest, when gone out of the Body: These were the apprehen∣sions
of some of them. Others were for haunting the abode of those more Poli∣tick men, though of never so great a Name and Place, who brought them into danger, and pushed them on when in it, even unto Death, and an obstinate de∣nial of all their Guilt at the last gasp of Life, only to confirm their own safety, or to promote an erroneous belief of the Virtue and Innocence of that way, which is founded upon the unproved Traditions of the most gross sort of Christians in the World, into which they themselves were trepann'd by a blinder manner of Education, or long abiding in those Towns or Dominions where better Truths, and purer Christianity were not admitted to display themselves, lest the Policy and Grandeur of the Romish Church-men should be demolished, by the Kings and Princes governing the Christian World. These debates were not clearly ended by the whole number, but rather concluded by a confused murmur of every one in a separate Voice, shewing their Disquiet too great to be ended in a conjoyned Body, without longer debates, and more time and leisure given to think what to say. But the forementioned Travellers being amazed at what was said, together with the confusion that seemed to end the Consult, having no power to make enquiry into the matter, were endeavouring to get forward that they might pursue their Journey; when he that first stopped Mr. Loe upon the Road, took hold of him, and said, Remember, Friend, that we died more upon the account of Policy, than Religion; I mean, as far as we were voluntary in our Deaths, de∣signing to humour the fancy of some Greater than our selves, and yet hoping to arrive at Saintship and a glorious memory; but yet here we feel our selves under a violent sting of Conscience, and under that Disquietude which threatens a long date before it draw to an end, if it end at all. No sooner was this delivered, but all the other four shew themselves, and speak something of a like resemblance, but with great confusion, constantly mixing promises and threats, and sighs and groans toge∣ther; and at the last, with one very deep and most lamentable Groan, these Ap∣pearances all begin to tremble, and at first fall into a gross and dark Cloud, which at length grew brighter and brighter, till at last it was wholly dwindled away into a purer Air. This delivered these two Gentlemen from their interruption, giving them leave to pursue their Journey, but did not deliver them from their wondering and discoursing upon the same, in an extraordinary manner: They had not gone very far, before their wondering grew so composed, that it gave way to more rational Conferences, which interchangeably they improved into some good Conclusions, naturally deduced from what they had seen and heard; as, That the most men change their minds at or after Death; these men did it not at Death, therefore might be allowed the common priviledge of Mankind, to do it afterward, seeing they did it not before. It's certain enough, that the senti∣ments of men in the Body, and those that are separate from it, are vastly differ∣ing: That obdurate Consciences may remain unsoftned even by Death it self, till the Terrors of another World perform it: That even the worst sort of Reli∣gion, may be attended with a sort of most stout and firm Professors; or, That a meer Artificial Religion, by long practice may so besot men, as to make them obstinate in its defence, even to Death it self: That vast is the difference be∣tween Natural Conscience, which is bred up, tutor'd and disciplin'd by Artificial Rules of a Religion contrived by Men, and that which is renewed, instructed and guided by the Spirit and Word of God: That there is not a possibility of ever trusting or believing the Professors of that Religion, whose greatest Priests and Leaders dare to leave the World, telling the most splendid, obstinate and de∣sperate Lyes that can be contrived by Humane skill.
But hold, says Mr. Pointwell, these things are a little too grave and serious for men whose minds are just tired with affrights, and contemplation; I will there∣fore a little refresh my own and your Thoughts, with a true History, referring to such men as these whose Appearances we have seen, upon this Subject, That there are no Jesuits in Hell: the thing was thus. A Jesuit Preaching in the Great Church in Padua, towards the end of his Sermon he fell into a large Commendation of the Order of the Jesuits, extolling it above all the Religious Orders that then were, or ever had been in the World, giving God thanks that he had the happiness to be of that Order: And in the close of his discourse, he told his Auditory, that he would acquaint them with a Vision which he had lately seen. The other Night, said he, I dream'd that I was in Hell, where me∣thought I saw Popes, Emperors, Kings, Queens, Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots, Monks, Friers, and some of all sorts of men both Ecclesiastical and Secular, but not one Jesuit amongst them all; which made me to bless God that ever I was born to be of so blessed a Society, which though it had sent so many thousands of that Holy Order to the Grave, yet never any of them went to Hell: And so he concluded his Sermon, with a fresh Encomium of the Society of Jesuits. The next Sunday after, a Dominican Fryer Preached in the same Church, and he also towards the end of his Sermon, fell upon the high praises of the Order of the Jesuits; repeating much of the Jesuit's Sermon the day before, and be∣wailing himself that it was not his fortune to be of that Holy Order, whereof none ever went to Hell, as the Reverend Father had told them the day before: At last he told the People, that he also had seen a Vision, and dreamed likewise one Night, that he was in Hell, where he saw Popes, Emperors, Kings, Cardi∣nals, and all sorts of Orders, as the Jesuits had notably shewed them the day be∣fore; but not a Jesuit (said the Fryer) could be seen amongst them all: Then thought I to my self, O what a blessed Order is this! O that I had been a Jesuit, and not a Dominican! and still I cast my eyes aside all over Hell, but could not find so much as a Piece of Jesuit there, but store of all other Religious Orders; yea, even of Dominicans, my own Order, I saw great store. At last me-thought I beckon'd a Little Devil to me, and asked softly in his ear, Whether there were any Jesuits in that place or no? He answered, That there were none there, but that they were kept in an Hell by themselves; which is a great Room under this, where (said the Little Devil) there be abundance of them, and they come thi∣ther so fast, that my Master Lucifer scarce knows where to bestow them; and be∣sides, they are so unruly, that if they were not kept by themselves, every body would be soon weary of this place: He further told me, That his Master durst not let them have any Gun-powder, for fear lest they should blow up this place. This Story ended, the two Travellers arrived at their Dining-place, where they ceased any farther Conference upon things of this Subject, till a new opportunity. FINIS.
