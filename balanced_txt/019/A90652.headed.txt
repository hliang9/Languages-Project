Who died September 15. 1646. with a perfect Memoriall of the particular Services and Battels that he himself was engaged in Person. BRing Reader, to this sacred Hearse, A teare Cemented with a Verse. First let thy melting fancie be Thaw'd to some pious Elegy; Then to these Reliques let thy eyes Disburse their watrie subsidies, Which by that Cold our sighs dispence, Shall into Christall straight condense, Which being thus enchas'd, shall shine Like Pearle congeal'd upon this Shrine, But when they find what flame does burne, Shut up ith Casket of this Urne, How Palme with Olive interweaves, And in this Tombe both twist their Leaves, And that within this Marble Cell The Ashes of great Essex dwell, Who under-rating his high bloud, Sought only to be great and good, And first himselfe, Exacted then By just commands too, other men, That us to vertue he might draw, More by Example then by Law;— They'l to resent this losse, I feare, Resolve into one Generall teare, Which being distild into his Tombe, Shall Balsome unto his dust become; So shall thy teares this Charter have, To lie as Leigers in his Grave, And to these honor'd Ashes bee A perpetuall Obsequie.

A List of the severall Victo∣ries in which his Excellency was ingaged in person. HIs Excellency being made Captaine Generall by the Parliament over all the Forces in En∣gland, as was Voted by both Houses the 12 day of July 1642. protesting to live and dye with him. And by the first of August following, his Excel∣lencie had raised 10000. men, which he caused to be committed to Officers, and drawn into Regi∣ments, and so marched immediatly into the feild. The 23. of October next after was a very great battell fought between Keynton and Edge∣hill by his Excellencie and his Army; and that of the Kings led by his Majesty: At which time his Excellencies Army killed the Kings Generall, the Earle of Lindsey, the Lord Auboney, Sir Ed∣mond Varney, and divers more; and took prisoners the Lord Willowby, three Colonels, and many hun∣dred more, and brought away 16 of the Kings Ensignes. His Excellencie was in this battle engaged a∣gainst a great Army, where was the King in per∣son, and Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Vis∣counts, Barons, Knights, and Gentlemen of all or∣ders, who engaged themselves against him; yet his Excellencies Army fought most chearfully by the example of their Generall, whose undaunted courage put life into every man. Afterwards the Kings Forces being come up to Branford and Henley in November, his Ex∣cellency after severall engagements with them, and assistance coming to him from the City of London, who protested to live and dye with him; he forced the Kings Army to retreate to Oxford with the losse of above two hundred men. In Aprill, Anno 1643. his Excellency being recruted, marched againe into the feild with his Army, and took the Towne and Garrison of Redding from his Majesty, and after severall de∣feats given to parties of the Kings Armie he took the Town of Cirencester. After which his Majesties whole Army being againe drawne into the feild, his Excellency mar∣ched up to them, the Queene came up to the Kings Army, and a great party with her to strengthen his Majesties Army against the Earle of Essex; But his Excellencie fought with them neare Nubery, where he killed five Lords, and divers others of quality, the King with the losse of 500 men retreated to Edge-hill, whither the Queen came to him. In May, 1644. his Excellencie desired the Parliament to have a Com∣mittee to reside with him in the Army, and his Excellencie made prepara∣tions to the feild, and presently besieged Oxford where the King then was, and at the beginning of June got away towards the West, the King and the Prince being gone to Exeter with the Lord Paulet, and others; his Ex∣cellencie having taken divers prisoners, drew his Army after them; the Queen fled over into France; his Exellencie took in the West divers persons in severall places, amongst which many of quality, and divers Garrisons: In June his Excellencie secured Weymouth, Taunton Deane, Wareham Bavo∣nestable, Mount Stanford neare Plymouth, Plimton, Saltash, and Lanceston. And in July his Excellencie gave a defeat to Greenvill neare Lestithiell in Cornwell, and took 100. prisoners, and killed 300. upon the place, and then took Tadcaster, and Foy; and did beat them from Newbridge, still taking more prisoners daily. In August his Excellency fell upon the Cornish Brigade neare Saltash, and brake through their Army, slew many of them upon the place, tooke 300. prisoners and four Drakes. Then the Kings whole Army, Maurices and Greenvils were drawn into the feild in Battalia, in number almost 20000 men, near Lestithiell, where his Excellencie daily skirmished with them, killed many, took prisoner Colonell Champernoone, who was sore wounded, and divers more, many lying sixe and eight in an heap, and upon desire his Excellencie granted them leave (at a parly) to bury their dead. On Saturday the 24. of August 1644. his Excellency appointed Major Generall Whitcot, and Colonell Ware to guard the rear of Lestithiell, and make a damme to stop provisions from the Kings Army that way; and his Excellencie with a small party of Colonel Gowres Regiment beat off 3000. horse and foot from Blazy Bridge, appointed by the enemy to stop provi∣sions from Millibilly-Bay, where his Excellencie▪ killed many, and took prisoners a Colonell, two Captaines, and divers others. In the beginning of September, his Excellencie notwithstanding that he was so over-powred by the enemy, yet preserved both himselfe and his men, forced the enemy from the Sea-coasts, and got safe to the Lord Ad∣mirall; his horse not above 3000. brake thorough the whole body of the Kings Army; and his foot not above 6000. though incompassed with 20000. of the Kings, from Gromporond, Enedor, and Foy, even to Blazy Bridge, who were resolved to give no quarter to our men; yet they fought it out so gallantly, killing two of theirs for every man that were lost, un∣till at last they got Articles from the Kings party to have a safe convoy to Lestithiell, Poole, and Wareham, their sicke men to remaine at Foy; and none of them be pressed to desert their service to his Excellencie. And his Excellencie being recruited in September from the Parliament, and in October had his Randezvous at Titchfeild, and falling on the Kings reare, took almost one hundred prisoners neare Kingscleare; and with the assistance of the Earle of Manchester and Sir William Waller, routed the Kings Army near Newbury, and took nine peeces of Ordnance, 300. pri∣soners, and 500.
